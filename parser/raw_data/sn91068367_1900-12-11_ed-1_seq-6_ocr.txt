THE WRECK OF THE Y08EMITE
1
An Account Given by Two of Her Crew
who Reaoh Manila.
Manila, DeVember 4. Two members
of the crew of the United States auxil
iary cruiser Yosemite, which recently
founded during a typhoon off the island
of Guam, have arrived at Cavite on
board the United States transport
Alaya, which left Guam, November
26th with seventy-five marines who had
been transferred ito Cavite from Guam.
The men are John Barry, a carpenter.
arid Henry Colligan, a hospital appren
tice:
A boom fifty feet long and a foot
thick, which was rigged over the
Yosemite's stern, snapped off when at
tempts Were made to steer with it.
Meantime what was left of the propel
ler was ad most out of the water and
the steamer was constantly settling
lower by the head. No progress was
possible and all on board thought their
last moments had come. The disci
pline on board was good.
After the Yosemite had drifted shore
ward from her anchorage she pounded
on a reef. The wind1 shifted with ex
treme suddenness, and terrific fury
and carried the vessel out through such
a narrow ouitilet in the harbor that no
one understood how she got through.
It was very dark and -thick. Attempts
of the United States collier Justin to
tow the cruiser were useless and the
Yosemite would inevitably have sunk.
The two mem said they believed there
was some difficulty with the pumps in
getting water out of the forward com
partment, but the hole in the bottom
was so big that the cruiser must have
funk no matter what had been done.
Several marines who were at Agana,
Guam, during the typhoon, said that
three-quarters of the town was under
water and that all the dwellings were
destroyed excepting those having tinn
ed roofs. The corrugated Iron roofs
surmounting the government buildings
and residences were, for the most part,
rifted bodily. The marines waded
about and assisted women and children
to places of refuge.
In the judgment of naval officers the
abandonment of the Yosemite was the
only course feasible, the feeling being
that the Justin might have stood by
longer, but that the result would have
been the same.
Next Year Cotton Crop.
Atlanta, Ga, December 4. Commis
sioner of Agriculture Stevens, who re
turned today from a trip over the state
said that the cotton acreage next year
would not be any larger than that
planted this year.
"Diversified crops are. beginning to
tell," said Mr. Stevens. "I find the
farmers are planting large quantities
of wheat more than ever before. This
is regarded as a good sign. The cotton
In Georgia has been nearer all picked
and now there are but a few hundred
bales left in the fields."
To Rnih the Army Bill.
Washington December 4. Represen
tative Hull, chairman of the commit
tee on military affairs, has introduced
a resolution for a special order for the
consideration of the army reorganiza
tion bill tomorrow immediately after the
reading of the Journal and providing
for a vote after three hours' debate on
each side.
Another Battle With Boers.
London. December 4. General Kitch
ener reports from South Africa that
the mounted troops of General Knox
were engaged all day (long Sunday with
part of General de Wet's forces, north

caped and Is supposed to be wandering
about In Westchester county.

Bloomingdale asylum for two years.
As he was tractable and subservient to
the rules of the institution he has been
allowed certain liberty which two days

of the gates. Since than, time he has
not been seen. As soon as his escape
was discovered attendants at the in
stitution started to search for him. but
he had left no trace. Mr. Chanler had

TO INVXST IN AMERICA
Big English Firm to Bay Oat the Mid
vale and the Cramp Plants.
New York, December 5. The Evening
Post says:
"Acording to a report that has reach
ed Wall street, Vickers Sons & Maxim,
limited, of England, have instituted
negotiations for the purchase of the
Midvale Steel Works, and the Cramp
Shipbuilding Company of Philadelphia.
The purpose of the English company
is believed to be to secure a share of the
United States government contracts
for warships, armor plate and ordnance.
"The report has it that $7,500,000 has
already been offered for the Midvale
Company, and that the Cramp purchase
will probably be partly effected by is
suing stock of the new corporation to
be formed when the deal has been com
pleted."
"It is said that final arrangements
for the deal are to be attempted next
week in this city, when Charles H.
Cramp will come here to meet a New
York banker who will represent the
English company. ,
"A well informed man in steel mat
ters said: 'More than a year ago John
Crossley, managing director of Vick
ers' Sons & Maxim, came to America
to purchase the Cramp shipyard. At
that time it was understood that the
negotiations fell through. Beginning
these negotiations a second time means
probably that a purchase will be made.
Vicker' Sons & Maxim are the giants
of the business the Krupps of Eng
land and have unlimited capital. They
can afford to buy Cramp's and the Mid
vale outright if they care to, but more
likely it is to be a stock purchase.
That the English concern will complete
the purchase I do not doubt.' "
GENERAL LEE AT OMAHA.
He Takes Charge of the Department of
the Missouri,
Omaha, Neb., December 4. General
Fitzhugh Lee, and their daughter, Ann,
arrived here today from Chicago. At
the station was Lieutenant G. M. Lee,
late of the Thirty-ninth infantry at Ma
nila, who has been sick at the Presidio
since his return from the Philippines.
Lieutenant Lee had not seen his par
ents for more than a year.
The arrangements for the formal
transfer of the department of the Mis
souri were declared off, owing to the
delay in the arrival of the new com
mander.
General Merriam, who has had the
departments of Colorado and Missouri
under his supervision, with his staff
officers and others of the army head
quarters here, was at the train to re
ceive him and General Lee is now in
command of this department.
Being somewhat weary with his trip,
General Lee had little to say. "I like
the west," he said, "and am certain
my duties here and relations with your
Lpeople will be very pleasant for me."

A SENSATIONAL. DUEL,
Between . a Lawyer and a Minister.
The Latter Killed
Williamson, W. Va, December 5.
This afternoon Hon. S. David Stokes
shot and instantly killed Rev. John W.
Wohl in a street duel here. Mr. Stokes
being also dangerously Injured. Mr.
Stokes, one of the most prominent
lawyers in Mingo county, lef t his office
this afternoon immediately after din
ner and pleasatly greeting friends on
the way, walked with quick and firm
step in the direction of the house occu
pied by Rev. Mr. Wohl. and his house
keeper, Mrs. Levine. Mr. Wohl's' family
being in Kentucky.
Thte men met at Mr. Wohl's gate.
An altercation followed. Both men
ran to the sidewalk directly in front of
the house. Something was said, almost
indistinguishable, that drew from Rev.
Wohl the sharp retort: "You are a
liar," and in, an instant the report of a
revolver was heard. Stokes tumbled,
tried to regain his his footing but, fell
in the street. "Wounded as he was, he
drew his revolver and covered the
minister, now within ten feet of his
fallen foe. Again Wohl fired, and sim
ultaneously with that shot, the gun in
the sinking hand of Stokes spoke.
"When the smoke cleared away two
men lay in their own blood upon the
sidewalk. A crowd ran to the scene.
Rev. "Wohl was dead. Chance had car
ried the bullet from Stokes pistol
through the head of the minister, kill
ing him as he fell. The bullet had en
tered Stokes side below the heart and
passed entirely through his body.
Up to a late hour this evening Mr.
Stokes has refused to say anything
concerning the terrible tragedy, and
Mrs. Levine, the housekeeper, is in
too much of a state of excitement to
talk.
Rev. Wohl was recognized as one of
the most forceful and eloquent of
Persbyterian ministers of this state.
Mr. Stokes is an ex-Virginia university
student and comes from one of the best
families of the Old Dominion.
THE POWERS AGREE
As to the Peace Terms to be Submitted
To China.
Washington, December 5. The state
department has been informed that the
foreign ministers at Pekin reached an
agreement which was submitted to the
home offices.' Secretary Hay today ca
bled Mr. Conger authorization to sign
the agreement on behalf of the United
States government. It is difficult to
gather details of the understanding at
this time. However, it is known that
in the two important issues that were
still open those relating to punish
ments and indemnity the views of the
United States government have prevail
ed. As td punishments they are to be the
severest that can be inflicted by the
Chinese government. As to indemnity,
the Chinese government is to formally
admit its liability and then the matter
Is to be left for future negotiation. It
was understood that on the other
points, the French proposition has
formed the basis of the agreement.

MORE STOCKBROKERS ARRESTED
On the Chare of Conduct lot; Fraudu
lent DosIne.
I v
New York. December 5. As the result
of investigations made by Assistant
District Attorney Byrne. C. W. Morgan,
trading as C. W. Morgan & Co.. stocK
brokers, and Morgan's bookkeeper.
Mlahael Hart, were today arrested on
the charge of conspiracy and grand lar
ceny. The men were locked up in po
lice headquarters.
The detectives confiscated all ' the
books and papers In the office of Mor
gan and In the Offices of L. EX Van
Riper and John B. McKenzie. discre
tionary brokers. Van Riper and Mc
Kenxie had left their offices. It was
found, that the written matter in the
books of VanRiper and McKenzie had
been torn out. leading the police to
suppose that they had been informed
of their coming.
The attention of Assistant District
Attorney Brvne was directed to the
matter through his work In the Rhera
case, the defendant having been arrest
ed for. It is said securing a sum of
money from General Daniel E. Sickles,
three weeks ago. which was to be in
vested in stocks. Shera's bookkeeper,
it is alleged, intimated that such meth
ods were in vogue with other brokers
in Wall street. A thorough investiga
tion was made and it was found that
McKenzie and Van I Li per did an exten
sive business throughout the United
States and Canadai They sent out as
100,000 letters a week, some of which
told how easily money was made in
Wall street, and others explaining cer
tain deals, .the money to be sent to
Morgan & CVx. or C, B. Lawrence. Jr.
VanRiper and McKenzie, it is alleged,
advised each other of their succoss with
the prospective customer and they in
turn advised Morgan. If a man sent
money to Morgan he would advise the
brokers. 4
Morgan had an office at Thirty-third
street and Broadway and the police say
he had various offices throughout the
country.
The complainant against the prisoners
is William Bailey, a mill owner of
Matteman. N. J, The police say they
have thirty others who will testify
against the men and one of the thirty
admits having lost $29,000 through deals.
When the police entered Morgan's of
fice to arrest him they found a man.
whose name Captain McClusky refuses
to divulge at this time, inquiring as to
what had become of his money. The
man want with the detectives to police
headquarters, where he said he had
placed $500 with the brokers and had
made $234 last month. He had left the
$500 with the brokers to be (traded with,
and on Tuesday afternoon was told that
it had been used to purchase sugar at
134 which was the highest figure. When
he inquired as to the profits the man
claims he was informed that sugar
"went down" and his ' money was
wiped out.
Assistant District Attorney Byrne
says that the strongest point" against
the brokers is the fact that in their ad
vices sent out to men who sent money
to Morgan some were told conditions
were favorable, and others were told
the same days that conditions were
unfavorable on the same stocks.
Mr. Bryne says that While Morgan
who was a member of the consolidated
stock exchange, undoubtedly made
some transactions which are in the re
cords, he marls other transactions which
counterbalanced the ones he made for
the benefit of his customers.

his nomination. In 1S44 two hours be

his nomination, was mayor of Buffalo.
Benjamin Harrison, two years before
his nomination, had retired from
