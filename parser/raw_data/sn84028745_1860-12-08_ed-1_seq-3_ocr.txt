Mr. Gilbert presented plat and estimate
for grading and paving sidewalk on Vine
street, from Mulberry to McMillan-street,
which was approved; and the Clerk wits in
structed to prepare and transmit an ordi
nance to the City Council, to assess a special
tax upon the real estate bounding said im
provement. The Clerk was instructed to transmit to
the City Council an ordinance to pave with
bowlders, Bard-alley, from Liberty-street to
Oliver-Btreet.
Mr. Gilbert presented an estimate of $300
In favor of John F. Dobbling, contractor, on

Polici Coobt. Judge Lowe disposed ot
sixteen cases yeBterdny, of which the fol
lowing are the most important:
Clemens Lawyee, a German recently from
the Fatherland, was arraigned on a charge
of burglary, having, it was proven, taken a
horse from the stable of Messrs. J. tc A. Ober
myer, during the night-time, and sold it for
the Bum or $2. Lawyee, it appears, had
been in the employ of the Messrs. Obormeyer,
who, for some reason, discharged him, with
out paying all he claimed by $2 : and he al
leges that he supposed that, as his late em
ployers had refused to pay him, he had a
right to pay himself. He was committed in
default of $500 bail for his appearance at the
Court of Common Pleas.
Wm. Kirkpatrick, said to have stolen goods
to the amount of $20, was committed to jail
in default of boil for his appearance for further
examination on Thursday.
Michael Gesavine, an old vagrant, was sent
to the City Prison for six months, from
which place he has but recently emerged.
Wm. Gray, on a similar charge, was sent
up for thirty days.
Cyrus Savage, another, but less inveterate,
vagrant, was sent up for twenty days.
Thomas Fitz, on a charge of petit larceny,
was sent to the Chain-gang for two months,
and fined $10.
Malcolm Montford, who, it Is alleged, has
recently committed several small thefts, was
committed to jail in default of $200 bail, for
a further examination on Thursday.
Alfred Cbatman, arrested for malicious
cutting, was held over in the sum of $500,
for his appearance for examination to day.
Dennis O'Brien, who acknowledged him
self a thief on a small scale, was sentenced
to the Chain-gang for two months.
The case of Charles Abbott, for assault and
battery, was continued till Monday, the bail
of the defendant being fixed at $200.
Kafsab Msktino. A citizens' meeting,
called to devise plans for collecting and for
warding contributions of money and neces
saries to the destitute in Kansas, convened

The Mayor was called to the Chair, and J.
A. Gano was appointed Secretary.
On motion, Messrs. J. W. Sibley, Geo. F.
Davis and Samuel M. Haughton were ap

themeetiig. After due deliberation, they
presented the following preamble and reso
lutions, which, upon being read, were
adopted:
Whereas: Various accounts have reached
us of great destitution and suffering among
the people of Kansas Territory, owing to the
failure of their crops the past season, we
would respectfully recommend the following
resolutions, viz:
Jleolved: That an Executive Committee
of three, with power to fill vacancies, be ap
pointed by the Chair, who are requested to
obtain early and reliable information, as to
the extent of sutTering in said Territory, and
who shall receive and disburse all contri
butions and donations made by our citizens
for the relief of the sufferers, in such manner
as tbey may deem best.
Retolved: That said Executive Committee
be authorized to appoint such sub commit
teeB and agents, for said collections and dis
tributions, as they may find necessary, to
carry out the object of this meeting, in the
most effectual and economical manner.
$ "Xetolved: That rubscriptious be now
opened for said relief, which shall be paya
ble at such periods, and in such sums as said
Executive Committee may designate."
In accordance with the terms of the first
resolution, Messrs. Wm. Hooper, J. C. But

METROPOLITAN HALL, December 7. 1860.
To Iht FaIUm of llu Daily Frtn:
Sum: .Your excellent journal having an
extent ive circulation among our working
nicn. invites me to seek its mediality in
renrhihg them. It is now many months
finte a writer in the Dial, probably the Iter.
Editor, tracing the causes of a certain 1am
entnble catastrophe, did not hesitate to
post both on the debtor side of popular ig
norance, loudly calling at the sime time for
workingmen's night-schoolB. Though I re
garded the lucubration of which I Bpeak as
unnaturally colored, I could not but esteem
the suggestion of night schools for the man
ns practical, and. coupled as it was at the
time with a high-minded, prompt and truly
Christian overt-act, unmistakably benevo
lent. Nevertheless, I knew well that no such
estnblishment, the Dial could found or regu
late, would reach even a single member of
the section of our community to which the
writer directed his remarks; and as that sec
tion has ppetial claims upon me, and ns those
remarks touched a chord whose vibrations I
recognize ns the familiar music of a brother's
voict lor this idea had long enlisted all my
sympathies, exertional as well as sentimen
tal I have come to the determination of
doing a little, as pioneer, in this new field.
And I nm happy to inform you, sir, that as
for as 1 have gone I have met with sympa
thy, support and success.
Last Monday, notwithstanding the severity
of the day and evening, our first public lec
ture was greeted by as beautiful a meeting
as I have yet seen in this city. The lecture
hall (Gordon's) was filled to the door by
workingmen; several speeches were de
livered in the best tiEto, and so respectful
was the attention and so gentlemanly the
decorum, that tbe falling of a pin might have
been heard during the pauses of the speaker.
Several of the auditors gave in their names
as membeis of the night-school, which com
menced the night following, and is now in
session every evening at Metropolitan Hall.
The Timet newspaper, while giving me
credit for purity of motive in this connec
tiontestimony which I accept thankfully,
because given voluntarily seems to think
that the want of which Mr. Conway had com
plained, and which is, thus far, successfully
apnroacbed, has been sntiiciently met by the
numerous night-schools, public and private,
wilh which (thank God) we are blessed,
taken in connection with the occasional lec
tures at our literary institutions. It is al
most impossible for the writer to exaggerate
the good which those establishments are
silently scattering abroad; but here is a
point to fix the gaze upon if there bo among
us hundreds upon hundreds on whose men
tal fallows one grain of this good seed never
falls!
I pause for a reply, nore is our special
field, and on this special field our special
mission. The more completely those founda
tions elevate their votaries, tbe more con
spicuous will be the distance between them
end the stand-still thousands below.
If supported, it is our fixed desire to make
nil our lectures and classes fret to the work
ingmen. At present we buve to charge five
cent!, but no more, to each person attending
a lecture. At present, also, we can have
but one class an English grammar-class
the very peculiar manner of instruction em
ployed in which, is bringing to it a very re
spectable and intelligent order of young
men. By-and-by we must have classes in
science conducted upon the same common
sense principle. We employ no books, and
give no tasks to the tongue, but address
ourselves to the underitandinff, the memory
and the hand.
If you approve of this idea, I will greatly
thank you, Mr. Editor, to give it the in
dorsement of respectable
Sir, &c. JOHN H. GREENE.

The Special Committee, appointed at the

A conflict has heretofore ' existed between
the two interests, which could not be re
pressed, except by a purchase by one of the
parties, of the interests of the other; and as
the contest was unprofitable to both parties,
a compromise has been effected. The new
company will, we learn, take possession to

Monkeys Coibinically Considereo. Ed
wards, in bis Voyage up the Amazon, has
some curious comments on the varieties in
the diet of bis party. He says monkeys are
eaten in the region, and are esteemed beyond
the wild game. When cooked they make
most delicious dish, though the rules by
which thfy ere served up are not to be found
in any of the numerous cook-books. One of
Mr. Edwards' party shot a sloth, and had
the animal skinned, with the in intention of
p referring the body for an anatrmio 1 friend,
lint the cook was too alert, and had the
Sloth in the stew-pan before an explanation
was made. Tbe buiiteis did their best to
lock with fuvor upon tbe dish, but the leau

AMUSEMENTS.
Tike's Opera-house. The tragedy of
Macbeth was well put npon the stagn laat
evening, and Mrs. Waller's "Lady Macbeth"
wos recarded by all as an excellent persona
tion. To-night the musical drama of Ouy
Mar,nerinn is to be given, with Mrs. Waller
as "Meg Merrilies," a part which Charlotte
Cushman has rendored famous in this coun
try, and which will give the audience an
opportunity to compare the personations of
these two great tragic artists. The farce of
the Strite Strain will conclude the perform
ance, with Fanny Denhnm as "Rosetta,"
National Theater. Annette Ince ap
pears this evening, for the last time, in the
historical tragedy of Mary Stuart, enacting
the heroine. Of this personation by Miss
Ince much has been said, and it is generally
acknowledged to be a fine conception, finely
portrayed. The play is interesting, and
abounds in effective situations and striking
dialogues. The domestic drama, Qale
Dreczely, will follow the tragedy.
Tns Heart of the Annus. The magnifi
cent painting of Church is still open in the
Opera-house building, and the number of
its visitors is daily increasing. No juBt idea
can be given of the "Heart of the Andes" to
those who have not seen it, and all who
omit giving it hours of study must of ne
cessity regret the opportunity they lose. It
seems the perfection of art, and is not
equaled, we believe, by any landscape in the
world.

Nervous Diseases in Paris—The Sufferings

Picayune writes in his lost letter:
Nervous diseases play great havoc In
Paris; and no wonder! The nerves are irri
tated iu so many ways by the strange life
led here.
There is Bouffe, an inimitable comic actor,
whose nerves are so jangled ho can not ap-
Sear on the stage, aud he is in such deep
epression of spirits his friends thought he
muBt go mad unless they procured some
diversion for his mind. They engaged him
to open a school for young actors, and this
he has done. If I remember rightly, Bouffe
married Perlet's daughter. Perlet was the
great comic actor of his day, and to this day
there are hosts of elderly men in Paris who
vow Perlet, in the Saartiamllurgomatter, tho
unsurpassed comic actor. The day Bouffo
solicited the interview in which he was to
ask M lie Perlet's hand, Perlet told him to
come and dine with bim. Bouffe went. The
young lady was in a convent; Perlet's wife
was dead. The two great comic actors dined
alone. Neither opened their lips during
pinner, but after coffee was served Perlet
took Boutlc s nana in bis, and said: "By
G d, you are the son-in-law for me!" How
many dinners between comic actors where
there is no audience are lugubrious as this
was I

Rossini's nerves are so shattered he can
not hear any music without barsting into a

road Bill:
"San Francisco, Xvember 9, 18S0. Be
lieving that a practicable line existed for the
Pncifio Kailroad across Central California, I
determined, before the next session of Con
gress, to examine the various passes of the
Siena Nevada in the vicinity. I have ex
omined a route through Georgetown, in El
Dorado County; a route via Illinoistown and
Dutch Flat, near the old Truckie route, and
also the Thenness route, via Nevada'and Eu
reka. The result is tbfit I have found a
practicable and good route across the Sierra
Nevada, via Illinoistown, Dutch riat and
Lake Pass.
"The distance from Sacramento to the Sum
mit is 104 miles; to the State line about 115
miles; to Mill's Crossing, on tbe main
Truckie, 132 miles; and to Virginia City lbj
miles. There is no grade over fifteen feet to
the mile. We got out of Summit Valley
through what 1 call Lake Pass, while Fre
mont!s route, or the old emigrant road, goes
over Truckie Pass, which is 700 feet higher
than, and a f w miles off my route. We
strike tbe foot of Truckie Lake, or tbe
cabins of tbe Dowcer party, nine miles from
tbe Summit, and fiom there it is an easy
grade down the Truckle River, descending
about forty feet per mile over a smooth
country. The elevation of the pass is 6,61)0
fcet.
"There av two other passes leading out of
Summit Valleywhich I had not time to ex
ploie, But either of them are practicable, at
least 150 miles shorter than the Feokwith
route, and cross the State at its narrowest
tioint.
"I will undertake to build a railroad over
the route in two years for $70,000 per mile,
from Sacramento City to tbe State line or
Washoe. Thus the question of crossing the
Sierra Nevada, I consider solved."

The Philosophy of Life in Paris—Epicurean
Existence in the French Capital.
Life in Paris, savs the correspondent of tha
Picayune the life all of us lead never looks
beyoud to-day's sunset. We give no thought
to the future. If we have much, if we have
little, it makes no difference, all goes into)
that ever-yawning gulf, Life in Paris. There
is no such thing as taking care of the pennies
bere; for 'tis in pennies our income u wasted
ttway ; a penny to this waiter, a penny to
that waiter, a penny to the newsboy, a peony
tor the theater-bill, a penny tor tbe loot
cricket, a penny for your cane, penny for
your bat, a penny to the hackmiin, a penny
iu me uuurupvut-r, s peuuv mj wis uwirat m
boy, a penny to your mistress's maid, ft
penny to your mistress's porter.
Pennies fly from you when you sip your
morning coffee at breakfast when you take
your beer when you dine when you take
your demi iatee, and when you put on your
liquid night-cap. Money steals -away as in
sensibly as time and as life. Then so many
things, elsewhere regarded as the luxuries of
life, are our prime necessaries of life, which
we must have, even if we go without our
bread and our cheese. Do not ask aught of
us when we die. Our purse is empty, our
boxes are empty, the boxes themselves are
pawned.
Why should we saveT Our mistress is
daughter of Danaus. We are childless. We
extricated ourselves from embarraasmeDt
yesterday which seemed insuperable and
the dav before and the day before that.
W by, shall we be "lucky" till our passing
bell tolls? besides, this wine shall not de
light our palate to-morrow as it does to-day,,
these viands shall not then seem half so suo
colent, this fruit half so flavored; thes Asa
eves shall have lost all their brightness, hex
cheeks all their bloom.
And who knows to-morrow T These
tv, icges in my Augers, this cold in my throaty
this general debility may be Death's, vaa
gunrd, and this very hour may W my to
morrow, my last to-morrow. Bt we crown
this hour with all tbe roses aar purs can
floro, end when they wither we'll replenish,
tbrin with lre.-h ro es, if w be. noA wUhere4
