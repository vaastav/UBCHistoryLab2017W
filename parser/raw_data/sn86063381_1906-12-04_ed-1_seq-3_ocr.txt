fTo the Senate and House of Represent
atives:
As a nation we still continue to en
joy a Iiterailj unprecedented pros
perity, and it is probable that only
reckless speculation and disregard of
legitimate business methods on the
part of the business world can ma
terially mar this prosperity.
No congiess in our time has done
more good work of importance than
the present congress. There were sev
eral matters left unfinished at your
last session, however, which I most
earnestly hope you will complete be
fore your -uljournment.
Corporation Campaign Contributions.
I again recommend a law prohibit
ing all corpoiations from contributing
to the campaign expenses of any party
Such a bill has already passed one
house of congress. Let individuals con
tribute as they desire, but let us pro
hibit in effective fashion all corpora
tions from making contributions for
any political purpose, directly or indi
rectly.
Government's Right of Appeal In
Criminal Crses.
Another bill which lias just passed
one house of the congress and which
it is urgently necessary should be en
acted into lav, is that conferring upon
the government the right of appeal in
criminal cases on questions of law.
This right exists in many of the states.
It exists in the District of Columbia by
-act of the congress. It is of course not
proposed that in any case a verdict for
the defendant on the merits should be
set aside. Recently in one district
where the government had indicted cer
tain persons for conspiracy in connec
tion with rebates the court sustained
the defendant's demurrer, while in an
other jurisdiction an indictment for
conspiracy to obtain rebates has been
sustained by the court, convictions ob
tained under it and two defendants
sentenced to imprisonment. The two
cases referred to may not be in real
conflict with each other, but it is unfor
tunate that there should even be an
apparent conflict. At present there is
no way by which the government can
cause such a conflict, when it occurs,
to be solved by an appeal to a higher
court, and the wheels of justice are
blocked without any real decision of
the question. I cannot too strongly
urge the passage of the bill in question.
A failure to pass it will result in seri
ously hampering the government in its
effort to obtain justice, especially
against wealthy individuals or corpo
rations that do wrong, and may also
prevent the government from obtain
ing justice for wageworkers who are
not themselves able effectively to con
test a case where the judgment of an
inferior court has been against them.
I have specifically in view a recent de
-cision by a district judge leaving rail
way employees without remedy for
violation of a certain so called labor
statute. It seems an absurdity to per
mit a single district judge, against
what may be the judgment of the im
mense majority of his colleagues on
the bench, to declare a law solemnly
enacted by the congress to be "uncon
stitutional" and then to deny to the
government the right to have the su
preme court definitely decide the ques
tion.
It is well to recollect that the real
efficiency of the law often depends not
lupon the passage of acts as to which
there is great public excitement, but
upon the passage of acts of this na
ture as to which there is not much
public excitement, because there is lit
tle public understanding of their im
portance, while the interested parties
are keenly alive to the desirability of
defeating them. The importance of
enacting into law the particular bill in
question is further increased by the
fact that the government has now defi
nitely begun a policy of resorting to
(the criminal law In those trust and in
terstate commerce cases where such a
course offers a reasonable chance of
{success. At first, as was proper, every
{effort was made to enforce these laws
(by civil proceedings, but it hag be
icome increasingly evident that the ac
ftlon of the government in finally decid
ing In certain cases to undertake crim
inal proceedings was justifiable, and,
though there may have been some con
spicuous failures in these cases, we
have had many successes, which have
undoubtedly had a deterrent effect up
on evildoers, whether the penalty in
flicted was In the shape of fine or iui
prlsonment. A ml penalties of* both
kinds have already been inflicted bj
the courts Of course where the judge
can see his way to inflict the penalty
of imprisonment the deterrent effect
the punishment on other offenders is
Increased, but sufficiently heavy flues
accomplish much. Judge Holt of the
New York district court in a recent
ilecision admirably stated the need for
treating with just severity offenders
of this kind. His opinion runs in part
ps follows:
Judge Holt Quoted.
"The government's evidence to es
tablish the defendant's guilt was clear,
conclusive and undisputed. The case
was a flagrant one. The transactions
which took place under this Illegal
contract were very large, the amounts
of rebates returned were considerable,
and the amount of the rebate Itself
was large, amounting to more than
one-fifth of the entire tariff charge for
the transportation of merchandise from
this city to Detroit. It is not too much
to say. in my opinion, that if this busi
ness was carried on for a considerable
time on that basisthat is, if this dis
crimination in favor of this particular
shipper was made with an eighteen
instead of a twenty-three cent rate
and the tariff rate was maintain
ed as against their competitorsthe
result might be, and not improba
bly would be, that their competi
tors would be driven out of business.
This crime is one which in its nature
is deliberate and premeditated. I think
over a fortnight elapsed between the
date of Palmer's letter requesting the
reduced rate and the answer of the
railroad company deciding to grant it,
and then for months afterward this
business was carried on and these
claims for rebates submitted month
after month and checks in payment of
them drawn mouth after month. Such
a vi ilation of the law. in my opinion,
in its essential nature is a very much
more heinous act than the ordinary
common, vulgar crimes which come be
fore criminal courts constantly for pun
ishment and which arise from sudden
passion or temptation. This crime in
this case was committed by men of
education smcl of larere business experi
ence, Mhose standing in the community
was such th.it they might have been
expected to set an example of obedi
ence to law, upon the maintenance of
which alone in this country the securi
ty of their property depends. It was
committed on behalf of a great ra
road corporation, which, like other rail
road corporations, has received gratu
itously from the state large and valu
able privileges for the public's con
venience and its own, which performs
quasi public functions and which is
charged A A ith the highest obligation in
the transaction of its bvsmess to treat
the citizens of this country alike and
not to carry on its business with unjust
discriminations between different citi
zens or different classes of citizens.
This crime in its nature is one usually
done with secrecy and proof of which
it is very difficult to obtain.
"The Interstate commerce act was
passed in 18S7, nearly twenty years
ago. Ever since that time complaints
of the granting of rebates by railroads
have been common, urgent and insist
ent, and, although the congress has re
peatedly passed legislation endeavor
ing to put a stop to this evil, the diffi
culty of obtaining proof upon which to
bring prosecution in these cases is so
great that this is the first case that
has ever been brought in this court,
and, as I am informed, this case and
one recently brought in Philadelphia
are the only cases that have ever been
brought in the eastern part of this
country. In fact, but few cases of this
kind have ever been brought in this
country, east or west. Now, under
these circumstances I am forced to
the conclusion In a case In which the
proof is so clear and the facts are so
flagrant it is the duty of the court to
fix a penalty which shall in some de
gree be commensurate with the gravity
of the offense. As between the two de
fendants, in my opinion, the principal
penalty should be imposed on the cor
poration. The traffic manager in this
case presumably acted without any ad
vantage to himself and without any in
terest in the transaction either by the
direct authority or in accordance with
what he understood to be the policy or
the wishes of his employer.
"The sentence of this court in thid
case is that the defendant Pomeroy for
each of the six offenses upon which he
has been couicted be fined the sum
of $1,000, making six fines, amounting
in all to the sum of $6,000, and the de
fendant, the New York Central and
Hudson River Railroad company, for
tach of the six crimes of which it has
been convicted be fined the sum of
$18,000, making six fines, amounting in
the aggregate to the sum of $108,000.
imd judgment to that effect will be
Entered in this case."
Getting Aside of Judgments and Grant
ing of New Trials.
In connection with this matter I
would like to call attention to the very
unsatisfactory state of our criminal
law, resulting in large part from the
habit of setting aside the judgments of
Inferior courts on technicalities abso
lutely unconnected with the merits of
the case and where there is no attempt
to show that there has been any failure
of substantial justice. It would be
well to enact a law providing some
thing to the effect that
i No judgment shall be set aside or
new trial granted in any cause, civil
or criminal, on the ground of misdi
section of the jury or the improper ad
mission or rejection of evidence or for
error as to any matter of pleading or
procedure unless, In the opinion of th*
court to which the application la made,
after an examination of the entire
cause, it shall affirmatively appear that
the error complained of has resulted in
a miscarriage of justice.
WISDOM INJUNCTIONS.
Pniper Use of This Power Rather Than
Its Abolition Demanded.
In my last message 1 suggested the
enactment of a law in connection with
the Issuance of injunctions, attention
having been sharply drawn to the mat
ter by the demand that the right of
applying injunctions in labor cases
should be wholly abolished. It Is at
least doubtful whether a law abolish
ing altogether the use of injunctions in
such cases would stand the test of the
courts, In which case, of course, the
legislation would be ineffective. More
over, I believe it would be wrong alto
gether to prohibit the use of injunc
tions. It is criminal to permit sympa
thy for criminals to wen'-pn our bands
in upholding the law, a if men seek
to destroy life or property by mob vio
lence there should be no impairment of
the power of the courts to deal with
them in the most summary and effec
tive way possible. But so far as pos
sible the abuse of the power should be
provided against by some such law as
I advocated last year.
In this matter of injunction there is
lodged in the hands of the judiciary a
necessary power which is nevertheless
subject to the possibility of grave
abuse. It is a power that should be
exercised with extreme care and should
be subject to the jealous scrutiny of all
men, and condemnation should be met
ed out as much to the judge who fails
to use It boldly when necessary as to
the judge who uses it wantonly or op
pressively. Of course a judge strong
enough to be fit for his office will en
join any resort to violence or intimi
dation, especially by conspiracy, no
matter what his opinion may be of the
rights of the original quarrel There
must be no hesitation in dealing with
disorder. But there must likewise be
no suc abuse of the injunctive power
as is implied in forbidding laboring
men to strive for their own betterment
in peaceful and lawful ways, nor must
the injunction be used merely to aid
some big corporation in carrying out
schemes for its own aggrandizement.
It must be remembered that a prelimi
nary injunction in a labor case, if
granted without adequate proof, even
when authority can be foufid to sup
port the conclusions of law on which
It is founded, may often settle the dis
pute between the parties, and therefore
if impropeily granted may do irrepara
ble wrong. Yet there are many judges
who assume a matter of course grant
ing of a preliminary injunction to be
the ordinary and proper judicial dispo
sition of such cases, and there have un
doubtedly been flagrant wrongs com
mitted by judges in connection with
labor disputes even within the last few
years, although I think much less often
than in former years. Such judges by
their unwise action immensely strength
en the hands of those who are striving
entirely to do away with the power of
Injunction, and therefore such careless
use of the injunctive process tends to
threaten its very existence, for if the
American people ever become convinc
ed that this process is habitually abus
ed, whether in matters affecting labor
or in matters affecting corporations, it
will be well nigh impossible to prevent
its abolition.
As to Public Opinion.
it may be the highest duty of a judge
at any given moment to disregard not
merely the wishes of individuals of
great political or financial power, but
the overwhelming tide of public senti
ment, and the judge who does thus dis
regard public sentiment when it Is
wrong, who brushes aside the plea of
any special interest when the pleading
is not founded on righteousness, per
forms the highest service to the coun
try. Such a judge is deserving of all
honor, and all honor cannot be paid to
this wise and fearless judge if we per
mit the growth of an absurd conven
tion which would forbid any criticism
of the judge of another type, who
shows himself timid in the presence of
arrogant disorder, or who on insuffi
cient grounds grants an injunction
that does grave injustice, or who in
his capacity as a construer, and there
fore in part a maker, of the law, in
flagrant fashion thwarts the cause of
decent government The judge has a
power over which no review can be
exercised. He himself sits in review
upon the acts of both the executive
and legislative branches of thp govern
ment. Save in the most extraordinary
cases, he is amenable only at the bar
of public opinion, and it is unwise to
maintain that public opinion in refer
ence to a man with such power shall
neither be expressed nor led.
The best judges have ever been fore
most to disclaim any immunity from
criticism. This has been true since the
days of the great English Lord Chan
cellor Parker, who said, "Let all peo
ple be at liberty to know what I found
my judgment upon, that so when I
have given it in any cause others may
be at liberty to judge of me." The
proprieties of the ease were set forth
with singular clearness and good tem
per by Judge W. H. Taft when a Unit
ed States circuit judge, eleven years
ago, in 1895:
"The opportunity freely and publicly
to criticise judicial action Is of vastly,
more Importance to the body politic
than the immunity of courts and
Judges from unjust aspersions and at
tack. Nothing tends more to render
judges careful in their decisions and
anxiously solicitous to do exact justice
than the consciousness that every act
of theirs is to be subjected to the intel
ligent scrutiny and candid criticism
of their fellow men. Such criticism Is
beneficial In proportion as it Is fair.
dispassionate, discriminating and based
on a knowledge of sound legal prin
ciples. The comments made'by learn
ed text writers and by the acute edi
tors of the various law reviews upou
judicial decisions are therefore highly
useful. Such critics constitute more
or less impartial tribunals of profes
sional opinion before which each judg
ment is made to stand or fall on its
merits and thus exert a strong influ
ence to secure uniformity of decision.
But nonprofessional criticism also is
by no means without its uses even if
accompanied, as It often Is. by a direct
attack upon the judicial fairness and
motives of the occupants of the bench,
for if the law is but the essence of
common sense the protest of many av
erage men may evidence a defect in a
judicial conclusion, though based on
the nicest legal reasoning and pro
foundest learning. The two Important
elements of moral character in a judge
are an earnest desire to reach a just
conclusion and courage to enforce It.
In so far as fear of public comment
does not affect the courage of a judge,
but only spurs him on to search his
conscience and to reach the result
which approves itself to his inmost
heart, such comment serves a useful
purpose There are few men, whether
they are judges for life or for a shorter
term, who do not prefer to earn and
hold the iespect of all and who cannot
be reached and made to pause and
deliberate by hostile public criticism.
In the case of judges having a life
tenure, indeed, their very independence
makes the right freely to comment on
their decisions of greater importance,
because it is the only practical and
available instrument in the hands of
a free people to keep such judges alive
to the reasonable demands of those
they serve
"On the other hand, the danger of
destroying the proper influence of ju
dicial decisions by creating unfounded
prejudices against the courts justifies
and requires that unjust attacks shall
be met and answered. Courts must ul
timately i est their defense upon the in
herent strength of the opinions they
deliver as the ground for their conclu
sions and must trust to the calm and
deliberate judgment of all the people
as their best vindication."
Criticism of Judges.
i There is oue consideration which
should be taken into account by the
good people who carry a sound prop
osition to an excess in objecting to any
criticism of a judge's decision. The in
stinct of the American people as a
whole is sound in this matter. They
will not subscribe to the doctrine that
any public servant is to be above all
criticism If the best citizens, those
most competent to express their judg
ment in such matters, and, above all,
those belonging to the great and hon
orable profession of the bar, so pro
foundly influential in American life,
take the position that there shall be no
criticism of a judge under any circum
stances, their view will not be accepted
by the American people as a whole. In
such event the people will turn to and
tend to accept as justifiable the intem
perate and improper criticism uttered
by unworthy agitators. Surely it is a
misfortune to leave to such critics a
function, right in itself, which they
are certain to abuse. Just and temper
ate criticism, when necessary. Is a
safeguard against the acceptance by
i ine people as a whole of that intem
perate antagonism toward the ju
diciary which must be combated by
every right thinking man and which, if
It became widespread among the peo
pie at large, would constitute a dire
menace to the republic.
EPIDEMIC OF^lYNCfflNfi.
Rule of Mob Represents Loosening of
Bands of Civilization.
In connection with the delays of the
law I call your attention and the at
tention of the nation to the prevalence
of crime among us, and, above all, to
the epidemic of lynching and mob vio
lence that springs up, now In one part
of our country, now in another. Each
section, north, south, east or west, has
its own faults. No section can with
wisdom spend its time jeering at the
faults of another section. It should
tbe busy trying to amend its own short
comings. To deal with the crime of
corruption it is necessary to have an
awakened public conscience and to
supplement this by whatever legisla
tion will add speed and certainty in the
execution of the law. When we deal
with lynching even more is necessary.
A great many white men are lynched,
but the crime is peculiarly frequent In
respect to black men. The greatest ex
isting cause of lynching is the perpe
tration, especially by black men, of
the hideous crime of rape, the most
abominable in all the category of
crimes, even worse than murder. Mobs
I frequently avenge the commission of
1 this crime by themselves torturing to
death the man committing it, thus
avenging in bestial fashion a bestial
deed and reducing themselves to a
i level with the criminal.
Lawlessness grows by what it feeds
upon, and when mobs begin to lynch
for rape they speedily extend the
sphere of their operations and lynch
for many other kinds of crimes, SO that
two-thirds of the lynchings are not for
rape at all, while a considerable pro
portion of the individuals lynched are
innocent of all crime. Governor Can
dler of Georgia stated on one occasion
some years ago, "I can say of a verity
that I have withjn the last month sav
ed the lives of half a dozen Innocent
negroes who were pursued by the mob
and brought them to trial In a court of
a law in which they were acquitted."
As Bishop Galloway of Mississippi has
finely said "When the rule of a mob
obtains, that which distinguishes a
high civilization Is surrendered. The
mob which lynches a negro charged
with rape will In a little while lynch a
white man suspected of crime. Every
Christian patriot in America needs to
lift up his voice in loud and eternal
protest against the mdb spirit that Is
threatening the integrity of this re
public." Governor Jelks of Alabama
has recently spoken as follows "The
lynching of any person for whatever
crime is inexcusable anywhere. It is a
defiance of orderly government. But
the killing of innocent people under
any provocation Is infinitely more hor
rible, and yet innocent people are like
ly to die when a mob's terrible lust is
once aroused. The lesson Is this: No
good citizen can afford to countenance
a defiance of the statutes, no matter
what the provocation. The innocent
frequently suffer and, It Is my obser
vation, more usually suffer than the
guilty. The white people of the south
indict the whole colored race on the
ground that even the better elements
lend no assistance whatever In ferret
ing out criminals of their own color.
The respectable colored people must
learn not to harbor their criminals, but
to assist the officers in bringing them
to justice. This is the larger crime,
and it provokes such atrocious offenses
as the one at Atlanta. The two races
can never get on until there is an un
derstanding on the part of both to
make common cause with the law
abiding against criminals of any color."
Treat Each Man Justly.
Moreover, where any crime commit
ted by a member of one race against a
member of another race is avenged in
such fashion that It seems as If not
the individual criminal, but the whole
race, is attacked the result is to exas
perate to the highest degree race feel
ing. There is but one safe rule In deal
ing with black men as with white men
it is the same rule that must be ap
plied in dealing with rich men and poor
menthat is, to treat each man. what
ever his color, his creed or his social
position, with even handed justice on
his real worth as a man. White peo
ple owe it quite as much to themselves
as to the colored race to treat well
the colored man who shows by his life
that he deserves such treatment, for it
Is surely the highest wisdom to en
courage in the colored race all those
Individuals who are honest, industri
ous, law abiding, and who therefore
make good and safe neighbors and cit
izens. Reward or punish the individ
ual on his merits as an individual.
Evil will surely come in the end to
both races if we substitute for this
just rule the habit of treating all the
members of the race, good and bad,
alike. There is no question of "social
equality" or "negro domination" in
1 volved, only the question of relentless
ly punishing bad men and of securing
to the good man the right to his life,
his liberty and the pursuit of his happi-!
ness as his own qualities of heart, head
and hand enable him to achieve it.
Every colored man should realize that
the worst enemy of his race is the ne-'
gro criminal, and, above all, the negro
criminal who commits the dreadful
crime of rape, and it should be felt
as in the highest degree an offense
against the whole country and against
the colored race in particular for a
colored man to fail to help the officers
of the law in hunting down with all
possible earnestness and zeal every
such infamous^offender. Moreover, in
my judgment, the crime of rape should
always be punished with death, as is
the case with murder. Assault with'
intent to commit rape should be made
a capital crime, at least in the discre
tion of the court, and provision should
be made by which the punishment pay
follow immediately upon the heels of'
the offense, while the trial should be
so conducted that the victim need not
be wantonly shamed while giving testi
mony and that the least possible pub
licity shall be given to the details.
The members of the white race, on
the other hand, should understand that
every lynching represents by just so
much a loosening of the bands of civ
ilization that the spirit of lynching
inevitably throws into prominence in
the community all the foul and evil
creatures who dwell therein. No man
can take part in the torture of a hu
man being without having his own
moral nature permanently lowered.
Every lynching means just so much
moral deterioration in all the children
who have any knowledge of it and
therefore just so much additional trou
ble for the next generation of Ameri
cans.
Let justice be both sure and swift,
but let it be justice under the law and
not the wild and crooked savagery of
a mob.
Negro Should Be Educated.
There is another matter which has a
direct bearing upon this matter of
lynching and of the brutal crime which
sometimes calls it forth and at other
times merely furnishes the excuse for
its existence. It is out of the question
for our people as a whole permanently
to rise by treading down any of their
own number. Even those who them
selves for the moment profit by such
maltreatment of their fellows will in
the long run also suffer. No more
shortsighted policy can be imagined
than in the fancied interest of one class
to prevent the education of another
class. The free public school, the chance
for each boy or girl to get a good ele
mentary education, lies at the founda
tion of our whole political situation.
In every community the poorest citi
zens, those who need the schools most,
would be deprived of them If they only
received school facilities proportion
ed to the taxes they paid. This is as
true of one portion of our country as'
of another, it is as true for the negro
as for the white man. The white man,
If he 1B wise, will decline to allow the!
negroes In a mass to grow to manhood
and womanhood without education..
Unquestionably education such as is)
obtained in our public schools does not
do everything toward making a man' a
good citizen, but it does much. Tht*
lowest and most brutal criminals-'
those, for instance, who commit th*-
crime of rapeare in the great major
ity men who have had either no edu
cation or very little, just as they are
almost invariably men who own n
property, for the man who puts money
by out of his earnings, like the man
who acquires education, is usually lift
ed above mere brutal criminalty. Of
course the best type of education for
the colored man, taken as a whole, is
such education as is conferred In
schools like Hampton and Tuskegee,
where the boys and girls, the young
men and young women, are trained in
dustrially as well as in the ordinary
public school branches. The graduates
of these schools turn out well in the
great majority of cases, and hardly
any of them become criminals, while
what little criminality there is never
takes the form of that brutal violence
which invites lynch law. Every grad
uate of these schoolsand, for the
matter of that, every other colored
man or womanwho leads a life so
useful and honorable as to win the
good will and respect of those whites
whose neighbor he or she is thereby
helps the whole colored race as it can
be helped in no other way, for next to
the negro himself the man who can do
most to help the negro is his white
neighbor who lives near him, and our
steady effort should be to better the
relations between the two. Great
though the benefit of these schools has
been to their colored pupils and to the
colored people, it may well be ques
tioned whether the benefit has not
been at least as great to the white
people among whom these colored pu
pils live after they graduate.
Be it remembered, furthermore, that
the individuals who, whether from fol
ly, from evil temper, from greed for
office or in a spirit of mere base dema
gogy, indulge in the inflammatory and
incendiary speeches and writings which
tend to arouse mobs and to bring about
lynching not only thus excite the mob,
but also tend by what criminologists
call "suggestion" greatly to increase
the likelihood of a repetition of the
very crime against which they are in
veighing. When the mob is composed
of the people of one race and the man
lynched is of another race, the men
who in their speeches and writings
either excite or justify the action tend,
of course, to excite a bitter race feel
ing and to cause the people of the op
posite race to lose sight of- the abom
inable act of the criminal himself, and,
in addition, by the prominence they
give to the hideous deed they undoubt
edly tend to excite in other brutal and
depraved natures thoughts of commit
ting it. Swift, relentless and orderly
punishment under the law is the only
way by which criminality of this type
can permanently be suppressed.
CAPITAL AND LABOR.
Infinite Harm Done by "Preachers of
Mere Discontent"
In dealing with both labor and cap
ital, with the questions affecting both
corporations and trades unions, there
is one matter more important to re
member than aught else, and that is
the infinite harm done by preachers of
mere discontent. These are the men
who seek to excite a violent class
hatred against all men of wealth. They
seek to turn wise and proper mov^
ments for the better control of cor
porations and for doing away with the
abuses connected with wealth into a
campaign of hysterical excitemenf aUd
falsehood in which the aim is to \xfi~
flame to madness the brutal passion*
of mankind. The sinister demagogues
and foolish visionaries who are always
eager to undertake such a campaign
of destruction sometimes seek to as
sociate themselves with those working
for a genuine reform in governmental
and social methods and sometimes
masquerade as such reformers. In
reality they are the worst enemies of
the cause they profess to advocate,
just as the purveyors of sensational
slander in newspaper or magazine are
the worst enemies of all men who are
engaged in an honest effort to better
what is bad in our social and govern
mental conditions.
To preach hatred of the rich man as
such, to carry on a campaign of slan
der and invective against him, to sees:
to mislead and inflame to madness
honest men whose lives are hard and
who have not the kind of mental train
ing which will permit them to appre
ciate the danger in the doctrines
preachedall this is to commit a crime
against the body politic and to be false
to every worthy principle and tradi
tion of American national life. More
over, while such preaching and such*
agitation may give a livelihood and a
certain notoriety to some of those who
take part in it and may result in the
temporary political success of others,
in the long run every such movement
