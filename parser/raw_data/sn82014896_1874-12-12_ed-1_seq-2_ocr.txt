SATURDAY, - DECEMBER 12, 1874.
Maricopa County School Afiairs.
Judge J. T. Alsap, ex-ofticio superinten
dent of public schools in Maricopa coun
ty, on December 5, sent his annual report
to Gov. Safford, in pursuance of law. The
report makes a very encouragingshowing,
from which we learn that 47 children have
attended public and 20 private school dur
ing the year, and that the average daily
attendance at public school was 32. The
private school only commenced In No
vember, and therefore no particulars of
progress reported, bat the advancement
made in the public school is put down as
" excellent." A female teacher at 100 per
mouth has taught in the public school,
and the private school is by a male teach
er who charges $5 per scholar per month.
The public school has been maintained
eight months this year. The text books
used are Pacific Coast readers and spell
ers; Moutieth's geography; Brown's gram
mar; Thompson's arithmetic. The valua
tion of the school-houses and furniture is
In district No. 1 (Phenix).theschool
house is 20x30 feet, and that in No. 2 (Mes
quite), 18x24. The amount of money re
ceived from (lie Territory SSol.oO, and from
county $867.41. Amount paid teachers
$S64; for houses and furniture $48!); for
school books $140; for salaries of superin
tendent aud census marshals $180; loroth
cr expenses $10.87 total paid out $1719.12,
leaving on band $2.75. Probable receipts
from Territory and county for 1S75, are es
timated at S120Ü, and amount needed for
the year at $1800.
Superintendent Alsap adds the follow
iug to the statistical part of his report:
I can scarcely suggest any improve
ments in the present school law that
would be practicable at the present time.
It has worked well much better than its
friends expected in the beginning, and it
is perhaps better to "let well enough
alone." There is always some difficulty,
however, in getting school boards to act,
and it may be that if the eutire school af
fairs of a county were placed in tlie lianas
of one man at any rate the mouied por
tion of them It would work better. But
no one man would lake this charge lor
nothing, and the school fund is not large
and cannot well afford to pay any more.
The people have supported me well in
my efforts to promote education in this
county, and I feel bound to say here that
without their strong support and coopera
tion, I should not Lave succeeded as well
ad I have done in establishing a good
school at this place. J. T. Alsap,
Sup't public schools Maricopa county.
Circumstances Alter Cases.
The case of the Territory vs. C. V. Moore
came up for hearing Tuesday of this week.
Here is an abstract from the court record
as it stands approved:
John Titus, Esq,., appearingas counsel for
Ibe prisoner Moore, the court remarked
that it supiosed the same order would be
entered iu this case as in the case of the
Territory vs. Joseph T. Holmes, Mr.
Hughes, the district attorney, and Judge
Titus, counsel for the deleusc, being part
ners. Whereupon Judge Titus rose and
declared to the court that it was a mistake
to suppose that he and Mr. lluuhes were
law partners in any sense; whereupon the
court inquired if they had not some little
time ago been partners? To which Judge
Titus replied they had not; ttiat they
were not now and never had been part
ners. The district attorney made a state
ment to the court to l he same effect, where
upon the case was allowed to proceed with
the district attorney as counsel for the
prosecution.
We have a letter of date August 7, 1874,
written aud signed by "John Titus" and
addressed to S. W. Foreman, Esq., (said
letter being sent to San Francisco, there
held for postage, theu sent to Foreman
and by the latter returned to us), in which
reference is made to The CitizeVs course
regarding the business developments con
nected with the reduction of the White
Mountain reservation, in which "John
Titus " says to Mr. Foreman:
Before this can be received, Tiie Akizo
sa Citizen if it reaches you regularly,
will bring information of the infamous
attack made indirectly on me, bv the di
rect attack made on my partner L. C.
Hughes.
We ask all to compare Titus statement
in court with this extract from a let
ter written by himself, and which letter
auy one may see upon application. From
the outrageously false insinuations and
charges contained iu said letter, that
about Mr. L. C. Hughes being his partner,
may also be false. As the matter has de
veloped itself, we don't wonder that dis
trict attorney Hughes declared to the court
that no partnership existed between him
self and Titus.
BiudeiIs on mail contracts may be in
terested to know that Postmaster General
Jewell has decided to return checks (de
posited in connection with bids) to bidders
by mail instead of as heretofore by hand
ing to tlie depositor iu person or an au
thorized attorney. These checks amount
to $1,000,000 annually.
Tub San Diego Would has become
wearied with the opposition of The Sac
ramento Union and San Francisco Call, to
the welfare of Southern California, and
emphatically advises the people down
that way to stop patronage to said papers.
Read the railroad news in our dispatch

arc entertained of favorable legislation at

Cash Vkkde, Dec. 9. The following in
formation is kindly furnished by Lieut.
Eaton: A scout left Camp Verde Novem
ber? with twenty days' ratiors. The first
day out it encountered a storm of six days'
duration, during whic.i they were without
t-mts. After the storm, the country was
flooded. The animals pulled oil' sixty-two
shoes iu making fifteen miles, and three
horses and two mules were disabled. The
snow on the Mogollón mountain was bel
ly deep to the animals and not enough
water could be had for thein to drink, Tlie
men got water by melting snow. On t he
oilier side of the mountains they spent
thirty-six hours in hunting for water;
made a permanent camp after finding it
and commenced to scout for Indian suns.
On the 28: h we struck a small party, kill
ed two bucks and captured the remainder,
two squaws and four children. This hap
pened on tlie main trail of the Indians,
and they got wind of it. The trail was
broad and the moon bright, so that it, could
tte followed almost on the run. About 1
o'clock the next morning, we came into
their deserted camp; the fires were still
burning. Then the scouts and soldiers
dropped every article of clothing that
would impede them and the chase com
menced. They led us north, first toward
the snow-line but soon swung round to the
south and crossed our trail of three days
previous, which was in the bottom of a
deep canyon, and were making for tlie
still larger canyon beyond. As soon as
we came in sight of their rear, they scat
tered and redoubled tkeir efforts to escape.
Just at this time, having been on Hu
maren twelve hours, one buck was killed
as lie ran and three squaws captured. Sol
diers and Indian scouts had been without
sleep and lood for forty-eight hours, and it
was impossible to pursue them further.
The .squaws captured say that, they were
fir-t put on the march to keep clear of tlie
party they saw to the east Capt. Mont
gomery's from Apache. This was in the
country southeast, from Chavez pass, on
the Li l lie Colorado road. A scout of three
days was made north of the road, which,
reached within twelve miles of San Fran
cisco mountains, but no Indian signs had j
been made since the snow. The Indians
captured are now at this post and will be
sent to the reservation.
Col. Wingard, paymaster and clerk, left
here yesterday for Cam p Apache; thence
to Camp Grant and other posts. They
were accompanied by an escort of ten
men mounted, armed and equipped, and
well prepared to meet any hardships
which they may encounter. Lieut. Whit
ney also accompanies the party.
Referring to the above, we have this
