KALIHI LABORATORY
SUGGESTED BY KOCH
l WASHINGTON, November 28. The
Secretary of the Interior will adopt the
plan recommended by Doctor Koch in
dealing with leprosy, in the Hawaiian
Islands. Congress made an appropria
tion for a leper hospital and the treat
ment of leprosy in the Hawaiian Is
lands in 1905,' which is not all expend
ed. Out of this fund a laboratory will
be established for the study of the dis
ease, .and the possible discovery of
improved methods of treatment or pre
vention, as recommended by Doctor
Koch, who has personally visited the
Islands and examined the situation.

THWTNG IN TOKIO.
TOKIO, Japan, December 5. -Rev.
Mr. Thwing, special secretary of the
International Eeform Bureau and dele
gate for Hawaii to the International
Opium Conference in Shanghai, is in
Tokio en route to the conference, which
will be held next month. The Chinese
and Japanese are enthusiastic over the
conference and greatly appreciate
America's help and friendship. Mr.
Thwing talked with Count Okuma, who
showed the greatest interest "in the
opium conference. He is a believer in
China and is earnest for the prohibition
of opium smoking, which he believes
can be accomplished if the powers will
cooperate. He declared there is a fine
opportunity for England to gain a good
name by stopping the opium traffic with
China. The Count said Japan's wise
opium laws were due to America's ex
cellent advice. Japan, he said, was now
foremost among those working toward
the goal of the total prohibition of the
opium trade, which was not only harm
ful, but unrighteous.
BIO DEAL FELL THROUGH,
BUT SMALLER ONE MADE
There was an unexpected hitch in
the negotiation for the sale of the en
tire Spreckels holdings between Fort
and Alakea street, mentioned in yes
terday's Advertiser, and the property
was withdrawn from further considera
tion by Rudolph Spreckels, the only
deal effected being the sale of the
Fpreckels Bank building to W. G. Irwin.
The reason for the withdrawal of the
property is reported to be the inability
of prospective purchasers and the seller
to agree on the price.
"The only deal put through was the
pale of the Spreckels building on Fort
Ftreet." said Mr. Spreckels iast even
ing, "and the remainder of the prop
erty has been withdrawn. That is all
I can say.
"The extension of Bishop street
through the property, however, will be
made, conditioned on the street being
continued to the waterfront"
In referring to the new street Mr.
Spreckels said he had tried-to be fair
and square with the government and
he believed he was even generous. j
Yesterday morning the negotiations
fo the sale of the Spreckels property
bad simmered down to the area on the
Ewa side of the new proposed street,
the prospective purchasers not feeling
that they could enter into a deal with
so large a property as that involved
in the entire square. Mr. Spreckels
came to Honolulu with the purpose of
disposing of the whole thing, and to
arrange with the government for ex
tending Bishop street.
A year or more ago two men were
in Honolulu looking over the Spreckels
real estate and securing data covering
all property owned by Mr. Spreckels.
A large amount of the work of gath
ering the data was carried on through
the Bureau of Conveyances. It was
rumored at the time that this work
was being done so that Mr. Spreckels
would be in a position to dispose of
his property interests, having titles,
etc., all secure.
By the acquisition of the Spreckels
building, Mr. Irwin has also got the
banking business of Clans Spreckels,
and the business heretofore conducted
as a partnership concern is now abso
lutely controlled by Mr. Irwin.
Chairman Tawney Would Ex
cept Hawaii Only in Cutting
Down Expenses.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 30. Represen
tative James A. Tawney of Minnesota,
chairman of the house appropriations
committee, returns to Washington for
the approaching session of Congress
more firmly convinced than ever that
it should be the policy of the govern
ment to call a temporary halt on the
work of building battleships and pro
viding for coast defenses, and use the
money thus saved for internal improve
ments.
"In two congresses," says Mr. Taw
ney, "we have" appropriated more
money for the navy than the entire
cost of the Panama canal. If public
sentiment will warrant a temporary let
up of this tremendous drain on the
treasury, the money thus saved will, in
a few years, take care of all the in
ternal improvements for which the
country is clamoring."
Mr. Tawney quotes approvingly the
prime minister of Great Britain, Her
bert Asquith, who said recently to par
liament that the time has come for an
abandonment of the ' ambitious com
petitive shipbuilding policy," which
for years has been running riot through
out all the great nations of the earth.
No Danger of Attack.
It is Mr. Tawney 's belief that if this
extraordinary work could be curtailed
not entirely stopped for four or five
years, the people wouldrise up and call
the government blessed. There is ab
solutely no immediate or remote dan
ger of war between the United States
and any v European power, he says, and
this being the case, what is the use of
spending millions upon millions of treas
ure on Atlantic coast fortifications f
These fortifications have already
been 'carried forward to considerable
lengths, and might with propriety be
left where they are for the next ten
years, or even longer.
"But what if a war with some Eu
ropean power should come unexpected
ly!" Mr. Tawney" was asked.
"In that event, our isolation would
be our chief protection. No European
power has a naval base on this side of
the Atlantic. Should Great Britain
ever begin the establishing of such a
base in the West Indies, it would be
possible for us to complete our Atlan
tic coast defenses in ample time to
escape danger. And without a naval
base on this side, no European power
would be in position to attack us.
Again, there is no European power
having the transport service necessary
to the carrying of 100,000 men and
equipment. That equipment, for the
purpose of invading our coast, would
include horses, wagons, tents, provi
sions, ammunition and all the other
things required bv an army in the
field. The physical difficulties are thus
insurmountable, and make our heavy
expenditures for eastern coast defenses
seem without warrant. '
"On the. west .coast the same thing
is true with regard to Japan that is
true on the east coast with regard to
Europe. Without a naval base in the
Pacific coast, no Japanese fleet could
leave that country for an attack on
the United States, and ever hope to
get back home again.
Would Fortify Hawaii.
"T indorse, however, the thorough
fortification of Hawaii, which is to be
our naval base in the Pacific. With
this fortification complete, it will be j
out of the question for any Asiatic
fleet to attack us on our own coasts.
"I was the first man in the House
of Representaives to make a speech
in favor of the annexation of Hawaii,
realizing its importance as a naval
base, and the passing yeaTs have con
firmed the opinion I then entertained.
That speech was made in 1S97. But
our western defenses should be con
fined to that eroup of Wands, and par
ticularly to Pearl Harbor."
