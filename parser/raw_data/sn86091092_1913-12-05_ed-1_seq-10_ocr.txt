IMPORTED PARASITE WILL
FIGHT 8AN JOSE SCALE
If certain experiments now being
conducted by Prof. Ireland, county
farm expert in this county, terminate
successfully, it will not bie necessary
to employ spraying in the future for
the eradication of San Jose scale in
the orchards of the apple growers.
Information reached the county ex
pert some time ago, through W. L
Hasbrouck, that Dr. H. A. Surface,
state zoologist for Pennsylvania, had
been experimenting with considerable
success upon a parasite that feeds up
on and eradicates (he scale, at the
same time being harmless to all other
forms of vegetation. In response to
^n application, Dr. Surface sent some
twigs containing the parasite, which
be is setting out in an orchard near
Xotus. where the csale has been some
what destructive.
On account of the season, Mr. Ire
land docs not expect great results
from the trial at this time, but intends
to send for more in the spring and
make a thorough test of the value of
the discovery.

PRES. WILSON DISCUSSES
SITUATION IN MEXICO
In hit first annual message to Con
gress President Wilson thus discusses
the Mexican situation:
"There is but one cloud upon our
horizon. That has shown itself to
the south of us, and hangs over Mex
ico. There can be no certain prospect
of peace in America until General
Huerta has surrendered his usurped
authority in Mexico; until it is under
stood on all hands, indeed, that such
pretended governments will not be
countenanced or dealt with by the
government of the United States. We
are the friends of constitutional gov
ernment in America; we are more
than its friends, we are its champ
ions; because in no other way can our
neighbors, to whom we would wish in
every way make proof of our
friendship, work out their own devel
opment in peace and liberty. Mexico
has no government. The attempt to
maintain one at the City of Mexico
has broken down, and a mert military
despotism has been set up *hich has
hardly (pore than the semblance of
national authority. It originated in j
the usurpation of Victorian« Huerta.
who, after a brief attempt to play the
part of constitutional President, has
at last cast aside even the pretense
of legal right and declared himself
dictator. As a consequence, a con
dition of affairs now exists id Mexico
which has been made doubtful
whether even the most elementary
and fundamental rights either of her
own people or of the citizens of other
countries resident within her territory
can long be successfully safeguarded,
and which threatens, if long continued,
to imperil the interests of peace, or
der, and tolerable life in the lands im
mediately to the south of us. Even
if the usurperer had succeeded in his
purposes, in despite of the constitu
tion of the republic and the rights of
its people, he would have set up noth
ing but a precarious and hateful pow
er. which could have lasted but a lit
tle while and whose eventual down
fall would have left the country in a
more deplorable condition than ever.
But he has not succeeded. He has
forfeited the respect and the moral
support even of those who were ar
one time willing to see him succeed
Little by little he has been complete!-,
isolated. By a little every day his
power and prestige are crumbling
and the collapse is not far a«tay. We
shall not, I believe, be oblige«! to alter
our policy of watchful waiting. An<:
then, when the end comes, we shall
hope to see constitutional Order re
stored in distressed Mexico by the
concert and energy of such of her
leaders as prefer the liberty of their
people to their own ambition^."
IMPORTANT DECISION ÖF
JUDGE SMITH VINDICATED
Supreme Court of State Reverses It
self and Upholds former Judge.
A decision rendered by the state su
preme court last week completely re
versed a former decision and sustain
ed a court decision rendered by the
late Judge Frank J. Smith of this dis
trict. The case was that of A. B.
Moss and brother against Aj H. Ra
mey and involved the ownership of
a 100-acre island in Snake river. Judge
Smith held that because the Moss bro
thers held the land bordering the
stream they did not by virtui thereof
hold ownership to land fhat might be
in the river and between their land
and the center of the stream. He was
reversed by the state supreme court
which now reverses its fornker deci
sion and places itself in harmony with
decisions rendered by the United
States supreme court.
The Idaho supreme court held that
the riparian owner was the fwner of
the unsurveyed island in the Snake
river for the reason that it was be
tween the main channel of the river
and the balance of the claimant's
land. The supreme court of the
United States held that an island in
existence in the river when Idaho be
came a state did not pass to the state
with statehood, but remained the
property of the United State^.
Under this decision by thf United
States supreme court it is riow held
that the Moss brothers coulq not es
tablish ownership to the island in
question. The cause is therefore re
manded to the trial court in the de
cision 'handed down on Wednesday
with directions to enter judgment
dismissing the action.
This final decision was written by
Justice Sullivan and fully concurred
in by Chief Justice Ailshie and Jus
tice Stewart. The final conclusion
of the state court, justifying its own
reversal, is given as follows:
"We are not unmindful of the con
tention by respondent that |he deci
sion of this court on the previous ap
peal is to the law of the case and that
we are bound to adhere to the con
clusion readied at that tim^. That
rule pravails in this state, as ^vas stat
ed in the previous opinion, but the
facts of this case are peculiar^ and we
believe it our duty to dispos« of each
case on its own facts and circum
stances so as to meet the requirements
of_ the law as nearly as possible. If
this land in controversy is stjll a part
of the public domain, as is undoubted
ly the case under the decision of the
supreme court of the Unjted States in
the Scott-Lattig case, it is clearly our
duty to take notice of that fyct as it
appears in the case and decide ac
cordingly, even though we have pre
viously decided to the contrary. This
case turns solely on a federal question,
and we are bound to follow the deci
sion of the.,federal supreme court as
we understand them. This latter case
runs counter to what this c<>urt had
understood the previous decisions of
that court to hold, and ît is our in
tention to follow it as far as we think
it goes. For these reasons we do not
think that the rule of res adjudicata,
or law of the case, applies to (his case
as it would apply-jf no federal ques
tions were involved-"

"No, Mr. Schaefer, we don't have

"Well, have you got somt dice?"
Schaefer insisted.
"I tell you," said the lady, a little

"Well, have you got any washtubs
