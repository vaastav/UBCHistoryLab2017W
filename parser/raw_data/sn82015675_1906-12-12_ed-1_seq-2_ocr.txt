President's Message.
President Roosevelt sent to con
gress a special message on Porto
Rico, which follows:
Nor. 21 I visited the liland of Torto
Rico, landlnr a Ponee, croHslnff by the
old Spanish road by Cayey to San Juan,
and . returning next morning- over the
new1 American road from Areclbo to
Ponce; ethe aeenery was beautiful, espe
cially among the mountains of the Inte
rior, which constitutes a veritable tropic
flwltserland. 2 could not embark at San
Juan because the harbor has not been
dredged out and can not receive an
'American battleehip. I do not think thie
act creditable to ui as a nation, and I
earnestly hope that Immediate provision
be made to dredge Han Juan harbor.
I doubt whether our people as a whole
realize the beauty and fertility of Porto
Xtioo, and the progress that has been
made under its admirable government.
"We have Just cause for pride in the char
acter of our representatives who have
administered the troplo islands which
came under our flag as a result of the
war with Spain; and of no one of them
is thla more true than of Porto Rico. It
would be Impossible to wish a more
faithful, a more efficient and a more dis
interested publio service than that now
being rendered in Porto Rloo by those in
control of the Insular government.
I stopped at a dozen towns all told,
and one of the notable features In every
town was the gathering of the school
children. The work that has been done
in Porto Rico for education has been
noteworthy. The main emphasis, as is
eminently wise and proper, has been put
upon primary education: but in addition
to this there is a normal school, an agri
cultural school, three industrial and three
hl?h schools. Every effort is being made
to serrure not only the benefits of ele
mentary education to all the Porto; Ri-
rans of the next generation, but also as
far as means will permit to train them
so that the trd'.istrial. agricultural and
co - e-f.ai opportunities of the island
ca ' n't - 't'-lin Nt advantage.

troops soi.i ! tifa.selves native Porto
Ricans. it would be from every stand
point a rclat-tkti not to perpetuate this
regiment.
In traversing the Island even the most
cursory survey leaves the beholder
truck with the evident rapid growth in
the oulture both of the sugar cane and
tobacco. The fruit industry Is also
arrowing-. Last year was the most pros
perous year that the island has ever
known before or since the American oc
cupation. Th total of exports and im
ports of the island was $45,000, 000.
agaJnat tU.OOQ.000 In 1901. This Is the
Hrtreat ta the island's history. Prior to
the Amertoan Occupation the greatest
trad for aay on year was that of 1896,
when it reached nearly $28,000,000. Last
year, therefore, there was double the
trad that there was In the most pros
perous year under the Spanish regime.
There were 210.273 tons of sugar export
ed last year, of the value of I14.1S6.S19:
S3.ei5,ica of tobacco, and 28,290,312
pound of coffee of the value of $3,481,
10t. Unfortunately, what used to be
Porto Rico's prime crop coffee haa not
shared this prosperity. It has never re
covered from th disaster of the hurri
cane, and moreover, the benefit of throw
ing open our market to It has not eonr
peasated for the loss Inflicted by the
closing; of the markets to it abroad. I
earnestly hope tbat som measure will
b taken for th benefit of th excellent
and high grade Porto Rican coffee.
There is a, matter to which I wish to
call your special attention, and that is
th desirability of conferring full Ameri
can citizenship upon th people of Porto
Rico. X most earnestly hope that this
will be done. I can not se how any
harm can possibly result from it. and it
seems to me a matter of right and Jus
tice to the people of Porto Rico. Th-y
are loyal, they are glad t be under our
uwjr are maxing- rapid Droress
eioug- th path of orderly liberty. Surely
we should show our appreciation of
there, our pride in what they hav done,
and our pleasure In extending: them rec
Bitioo for what ha ben done, bygranUng
there fall American cit item-hip.
Under the wis administration of the
present governor and council, marked
progress has been made in the difficult
matter of granting to the people of the
island the largest measure of self-government
that can with safety be given
at the present time. It would have been
a very serious mistake to have gone anv
raster than we have already gone in this
direction. The Torto Rlcans have com
plete and absolute autonomy in all their
municipal governments, th only power
ever them poss-ssed by the Insular gov
ernment being that of removing corrupt
or incompetent municipal official. This
power has never been exercised save on
the clearest proof of corruption or of In
competencesuch ae to jeopardize the
Interests of the people 0f the island: and
under such circumstances it has been
fearlfwly used to the Immense benefit of
the reople It Is not a power with which
It would be safe, for th .- w .v..
1st mil itself, to dispense at present The
lower house is absolutely elective while
the upper house Is appointive." Thii
scheme Is working well; no Injustice of
!?? . t?Ylt. fTOm nd rat ben
efit to the Island, and it should certainly
not be changed at this time. The ma
chinery of the elections is administered
entirely by the Porto Rican people them
selves, the governor and council keeoinr
only uch supervision as is necessary in
order to Insure an orderly electton. Kny
protest as to electoral frauds is settled
In the courts. Here a-cain it would not
be safe to make any change In the pres
ent system. The elections this year were
absolutely orderly, unaeoonmanled bv
any disturbance; and no pretest has been
elections. " a-imuifo- imee comeac are
threatened where .tn majorities were
very small and error was claimed: the
contests, of course, to be settled In the
courts. In short, th governor and coun
cil are co-operating- with all of the mos
enlightened and most patriotic of the
people of Porto Rico in educating the
citizens of the island In the principles of
orderly -liberty. .They - are providing-
government based upon each citizen's
self-respect, and the mutual respect of
all citizens; that is, based upon rigid
observance of the principle of Justice
and honesty. It has not been easy to
instill Into the minds of people unaccus
tomed to the exercise of freedom the two
basic principles of our American system:
the principle that the majority must rule,
and the principle that the minority has
rights which must not be disregarded or
trampled upon. Yet real progress has
been made in having these principles
accepted a3 elementary, as foundations
of suceess'ul self-government.
All the Insular governments should be
placed in one bureau, . either in the de
partment of war or the department of
state. It ia a mistake not to so arrange
our handling ef these island at Wash
ing as to be able to take advantage of
the experience gained In one, when deal
ing with the problems that from time to
time arise in another.
In conclusion let me express my ad
miration for the work done by the con
gress when it enacted the law under
which the island is now being adminis
tered. After seeing the island person
ally, and after five years' experience In
connection with Its administration, it Is
but fair to those who devised this law
to say that it would be well-nigh Impos
sible to have devised any other which
in the actual working would hav accom
plished better results.
