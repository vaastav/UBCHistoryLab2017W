THE Fargo Forum reports that
petition, signed by farmers, physicians,
merchants, blacksmiths, bankers ar.i
others frum Page, Cass county, has been
gotteu up to praise Governor Bridget for
offering to furnish funds ^to prosecute
the railroad rate case. If the petitioners
would pause and think they would soon
see that about all the good that is likely
to come out of this proposed suit is the
public agitation of the need of a lower
rate on grain and other classes
of freight.
The state railroad commissioners do not
claim any right to regulate freight rates
in other states. The most they could
do, if the oourts sustained them, is to
enforce a reasonable rate between points
within this state. As most all the
North Dakota wheat is shipped to Du
luth or Minneapolis through another
state, the case is simply one for the inter­
state commerce commission to act upon.
There might be a local reduction OD
rates obtained, but it would only effect
shipments mostly from one town to
another in the state. Such a reduction,
it is true, would help a few wholesalers
and shippers somewhat, but would not
effect the great bulk of the freight busi­
ness nor bring the relief sought by the
commissioners, to the producers of the
state.
Tbe interstate commerce commission
has publicly declared they have little or
no authority under the law to enforce
their rulings. A suit brought before
this commission involves a long, tedious
and expensive process where any rights
for the public are to be gained, and tbe
result is practically Predetermined. So
the wheat raisers of North Dakota have
little prospect for prosecuting a success­
ful suit for freight reduction on giain
before the interstate commission aod less
through the efforts of any state railway
commission.
In this matter the voters have gradu­
ally allowed themselves to be drawn into
a legal tangle from whioh there is no
esoape at present and not until a more
intelligent and united policy is pursued
by them.
What freight reductions, therefore,
we can hope for, must come through the
voluntary gift of the roads, on their own
judgment as to the wisdom of suob a
move in settling up and developing the
state, and thereby increasing their own
business and the value of their own
property.
OTHF.R STATES BEHIND.
THERE are more states than North
Dakota where tbe expenditures exceeded
the revenues and where tbe officials are
demanding increased taxation to meet
tbe bills. Tbe actnal financial condition
of this state is probably known to but
few and ia not likely to be fully known
tor some time. Tbe state bas bad to
borrow money to pay running expenst a
and ia at tbe debt limit.
In Iowa the state anditor in bis bi­
ennial report, estimates tbat there will
"be a deficit ia tbe state treasury of
nearly $300,000 next June. He recom­
mends tbat tbe state finances be brought
to a oash basis, that tbe legislature in­
crease the tax levy fof the next two years
to suoh an extent as may seem necessary
and reduce the expenses of tbe state
government and tbe state institutions.
Illinois bas jnst bad her'.legislature
called in special session to provide,
among other things, for increased tax­
ation and to meet such expenses as
supplies for the soldiers home, etc.
Other states are in tbe same fix.
The national government is running
from 40 to 60 millions behind, a year.
The remedy is the same everywhere—
raise more taxes.
Increased expenses, more public
offices, increase of tbe dependent class
on government employment or bounty,
all mast be paid by tbe taxpayer, whi.'e
bis power to do so is decreased, and de
creasing.
IGNORING THE PARTY CAUCUS.
IF reports from Washington are to be
believed a spirit of opposition to the
party canons rnns high this session
among tbe republican members. Speaker
Reed is openly opposing some of tbe
important recommendations of tbe presi­
dent, like tbe proposal to annex Hawaii
as a territory of tbe United States.
There are several important issues advo­
cated by tbe administration opposed by
men like Hoar, Reed, Dingley. A re­
publican member has secured pledges
from associates to oppose tbe civil service
law which MoBinley is greatly in favor
of. Tbe feeling to vote and speak inde­
pendently of tbe caucus on leading
questions was never as strong, it is said.
It shows that tbe time is coming when
tbe party caucus and the party whip
will lose tbeir force and men will not act
subordinates or mere part* of a
And it also shows a lack of
)M
confidence in the MoKinley Hanna
faction now in control ot tbe patronage.
Tbe patronage argument it is eipected,
will be used as the last resort, tbe same
as by Cleveland, but its influence is pur­
chased intluence and is naturally tem
porary and unoertam. All this is a good
sign for the oountry at large.
DIVIDED OPINION.
THE republicans in congress are divid
ed on President MoKinley's currenoy
scheme for breaking tbe endless
ohain. While none of them propose
tbe right remedy, viz, exercisingthe gov­
ernment option to redeem tbe green*
backs in either gold or silver, yet severul
prominent republican leaders strongly
oppose the MoKinley plan.
Congressman Walker, chairman of the
bouse committee on banking aud the
currenoy, speaks of the president's sug­
gestion as follows:j
"The recommendation that greenbacks
redeemed in gold be not paid outexceot
for gold, if enacted into law. would en­
able one man with SI,000,000 of green­
backs, demanding gold of the treasury
and then depositing gold in the bank for
greenbacks aud repeating the prooese
3iG times, to retire the whole8.'UG,000,000
in the time it would take him to oscillate
between the sub-treasury in New York
and his confederate foreign broker.
"The recommendation that banks be
required to redeem their cotes in gold
with no other provision of law would
cause every bank in the country to sur­
render its circulation, and then what
agency would keep the country on a gold
basis."
A BIG UNDERTAKING.
THE ladies belonging to various tem­
perance societies in the country are un­
dertaking a big task to clear off a 8300,
000 mortgage on the splendid W. C. T.
U. building in Chicago before Christmas.
If they succeed it will be an event worth
recording in the fight against the mort­
gagee and the increasing power of his
dollar over the earning capacities of
both men and women. The plan pro­
posed by Miss Frances Willard is out­
lined as follows and everyone hopes that
sucoess may attend it:
Every White Ribbouer in the United
States has been asked to raise §2, no
matter where they get it. The money
of ths brewer or disiiller or the tnoder
uter drinker will be vrecome for the
good cause, on the principle thpt the end
justifies the means. Each White Kib
Uoner in the country, aud there are
nearly
150.000 of them, has received four
cards, each having a little space for the
insertion of a fifty-cent piece. These
cards they are asked to send out to their
friends outside of White Ribbon lines
with aB invitation to subscribe the fifty
cents, and send tne card to the temple.
MANITOBA WHEAT GRADING.
FARMERS of North Dakota are not the
only wheat raisers who complain of
grades given wbeat. In Manitoba the
"kick" is reported as greater than in
some localities on tbis side the line,
i'he East Grand Forks Courier says:
Farmers this side of the Canadian line
are not the only kickers on misgtading
of wheat. The Chronicle, published at
Morden, iuan., contends tbat by fraudu­
lent mis-grading of wheat the farmers of
tbe three municipalities of Stanley,
Duffenn and Rhineland have been
cheated out of a sum approaching to
$50,000. This sum is arrived at as the
difference between No. 1 bard and No. 2
bard, on approximately 1,500,000 bushels
wheat. Of this great quantity of wbeat,
probably not one-tenth, according to tbe
Chronicle, bas been graded No. 1 herd.
At Morden elevators all wheat is graded
No. 2. Yet there is good evidence tbat
almost all tbe wbeat grown in tbe dis­
trict under consideration will meet tbe
requirements of No. 1 bard as defined at
tbe beginning of tbe shipping season by
tbe grain standard board.
INVESTING SCHOOL MONET
THE
state eobool board of university
and sobool lands is seriously considering
tbe plan of making loans of school
money on farm security. This plan was
proposed by the former Shortridge ad­
ministration and loudly denounced and
ridiouled as nothing but a "pop scheme"
to distribute the school funds to the
horny-handed farmer. Now that a sup­
posed political advantage is seen in the
proposition, the plan of the despised
"pop" may be adopted,by those who once
frantically opposed it.
Tbe plan is of doubtful utility how­
ever, and will oertainly leave tbe state
open to imposition and loss. Tbe school
funds tbat oannot be invested in other
securities had better be left for tbe use
of the banks where deposited, than in­
vested in certain lands under the exist­
ing provisions of tbe law tbat permits it
beiag done.
COMPARISON OF TARIFF RECEIPTS.
THE following figures show the
revenue which was scoured by tbe two
tariffs during the initial four months of
their operation:
Wilson ant.
First month $15,501,wo
Second montn 11,4)62,118
Third month 10,260,««2
Fourth month 11,203,049

Tbis presents a balance of over 314,
000,000 in favor of tbe Wilson bill. It
should also be remembered tbat tbe
revenue secured by the Wilson bill for
time in questton was collected when
business was paralyzed by the panic of
1893, while the Dingley bill was operat­
ing under conditions tbat are claimed to
be entirely opposite.
ADMITS IT IS RIGHT.
PRESIDENT MCKINLKY
recognizes the
desirability of bimetallism in bis mes­
sage to congress. He refers to tbe com­
mission for an international agreement,as
having done good work, and expresses
the-hope tbat further time may see the
effort crowned with success. MoKinley
probably does not believe any agreement
except possibly with France, can be
re&ohed,but be acknowledges the justice
and right in tbe principle involved—the
equal use of botb metals as money. To
do this, and not insist tbat a great nation
like the United States can afford to take
a firm stand for what is right, regardless
of the movements of other nations, is
not in aooord with the professions of a
statesmen or a president of tbis nation.
THE sentiment against the annexation
of Hawaii js growing fast and there
seems little probability of congress tak­
ing the step. Ex-Senator Fred Duboiee
of Idaho, who has just returned from a
trip to China, Japan and tbe island,says:
The United States will not annex
these islands against the bitter opposi­
tion of the natives. He says there ore
less than 1,200 male Americans on the
islands over 21 years of age and nearly
half of them are opposed to annexation,
while nearly all the balance of the popu­
lation are against.
Asa matter of safety and general poli­
cy the proposition for the United States
to acquire as territory, any land or is­
land, inhabited by foreigners and ^differ­
ing largely from our own in all sooial
and racial respects is not regarded with
favor. We have enough to take care of
as it is—enough foriigners to civilize, for
the protection of the liberty of the
American citizens.
HON. R. P. BLAND, pitilessly puue
tures McKiuley's recommendation that
national banks be permitted to issue
notes at the par value of bonds deposited
and that the notes be redeemable in
gold. Mr. Bland asks: "If it is a great
strain and burden upon the government
to maintain gold redemption for 834G,
000,000 of greenbacks, bow enn tbe
banks possibly obtain gold to redeem
their notes? If all the wealth and power
of the government finds it hazardous to
maintain gold redemption, how could
part of that wealth invested in banking
institutions procure gold? The banks
would be forci/d to surrender their notes
and thus work disastrous contraction of
the currency. No scheme can be devised
that is worse than this."—Minneapolis
Times.
Di:cEM iiii wheat closed today the Oth,
iast, in Chicago at 81.07 and 94c. in LHI
luth, a difference of 13 cents. This
seems to clearly show an arbitrary con­
trol of the markets the ordinary differ­
ence being bvt about four or live cents.
Duluth prices which have heretofore
b6en several cents higher than Minne­
apolis are also of late reduced beioiv
Minneapolis. To account for this on
any legitimate trnde reason is difficult.
These differences in prices, developed in
tbe last few weeKb, show a control of
market prices at Duluth and Minneapol­
is which the producer of the northwest
better understands when be sells bis
grain.
THE city comptroller of Chicago is ad­
vertising for bids for supplies and states
in the advertisement tbat certified
checks on the First National bank of
that oity—Secretary Gagf's bank—will
not be accepted. The bank refused to
pay a certified check deposited by a bid­
der, on a former occassion. Tbe city
sustained a loss there by and bas begun
suit for its collection, and the bunk
threatens the city with a suit for tbe
reflection in tbe advertisement. It looks
as if tbe oity had the better end of tbe
deal and was in the right. The banks
explanation bas not been published as
yet.
IT IS said there are over fifty divorce
cases pending in Grand Forks county
and not over half a dozen will be con­
tested. Tbe state law thus seems to be
shown as an acceptable statute of relief
for by far the greater number of those
who are directly concerned—the clients
in tbis olass of cases. There is consid­
erable opposition to the North Dakota
divorce law, from many quarters, but it
is frequently asked why should arbitrary
obstructions be placed in tbe way of
parties who have determined and agreed
that a legal separation is for their
mutual interests?
IT IS reported from lac una that Rocke­
feller, who invested over $4,000,000 in
railways, mining machinery, mines, etc.,
at and near Everett, Wash., will lose
over $3,000,000 in tbe scheme. Fart of
the Everett & Monte Cristo road, a min­
ing line, which was recently washed out
will not be rebuilt as tbe mines do not
pay.
But the Standard Oil company will
never miss a few millions more or less
and the money bas done some people a
good turn in their being allowed to earn
and spend it.
PRESIDENT ELLEN of the Northern
Pacific oalled the attention of the board
of directors at tbe New York meeting to
tbe faot that the net earnings of the
comoany for tbe four months ending
Oct. 31 were $^,440,000. He estimates
the net for November at $1,300,000 and
for December at $900,000, making net
earnings for the first six months of tbe
fisoal year $6,640,000. The fixed charges
for tbe entire year were about $6,000,000.
Tbe estimated surplus for tbe entire
year over fixed charges is $2,785,000.
THE associated press is sending oat
long accounts of murder mysteries and
details ot oriminal trials that fill
oolumns of the press of certain leading
dailies. ThiB is to the exclusion of
other and far more important matters
for tbe pnbln. The fate of one man, a
criminal or other wise, is an insignifi­
cant subject for any prolonged attention
these days, exoept where he stands in
some relation to a prinoiple affecting tbe
whole people.
IF congress wants to economize where
it would count, let tbe old "river and
harbor" appropriation be thrown over
board, or out to a figure where necessity
demands. The expenditure of hundreds
of millions of dollars in what are prao
tiDiilly uanavigable streams is a clear
case of squandering money. Some of
the big monthly deficits might be re­
duced in this way.
ILLINOIS has oue of the smallest wheat
acerages ever sowed, owing to dry
weather last fall. The acreage is 12ptr
cent, or nearly half a million aores less
than last year. The graiu lay from four
to eight weeks before sprouting and
much of it, according to the bulletin of
the.state board of agriculture, is uneven
aud unpromising in its appearance at
this time.
THE prosperity wave bas not rolled
over Minneapolis in spite of the daily
assertions of her press. The city schools
are likely to be closed for want of funds.
There is a great difference between the
real facts in regard to the wave as seen
in the cities and towns, and the state­
ments read in the press. These latter
assertions have been aptly oalled "barren
idealities."
THE opinion of leading congressman
and senators on the president's message
is that McKinley reaHy means to retire
the greenbacks, although he does not say
so. Even republican mGiiibGrs who
specify any points in an opinion are in­
clined to omit or excuse the presidential
references to the currency and to Cuba.
Til EKE is confidence shown in North
Dakota dirt. At the annual delinquent
tax sales every county reports plenty oi'
bidders. Outsiders are beginning to
realize the value of our cheap farm lands
and hope to get some of it jr the unpaid
taxes. The interest and penalty however
would seem to be sufficient in itself.
Two blind piggers sent to jail in 13ot
tiueau county under the provisions of
our state prohibition law, got out lust
week. They did not escape through
any loop hole in tbe law but broke out
of their cells. The North Dakota pro­
hibition luw when it is enforced dueo uut
let any guilty man escape.

T. Yerkes, the street car magnate has

paper enemies in Chicago. Medill of tbe

fying lenses.

Teller and his "clique," as tbe Journal
calls it. Partisan misrepresentation ha6
