TUESDAY, DECEMBER 15,1853.
CTIABLE9TON.
If anyplace in Jeff Davis 1 dominions
has had a foil chance to ayoy the anxie
ties, discomforts, and uncertainties of the
war, in full measure, and to its heart’s con
tent R is Charleston. The fellow who
wished his. throat had been constructed
like an anger, so that when he 'drank his
whisky it might circle about, in its descent,
as long as possible, so as to impart the
- greatest amount of gustatoiy delight of
. which -it was capable, longed for a condi
tion pf things much like what that delecta
ble; nest of treason has enjoyed. - True,
,they do not get veiy badly hurt; but;then
• they are kept in goodly expectation that
they may be. We read now that Gilmore
is giving the city about twenty, shells per
day, besides what he bestows upon old
Fort Sumter and the other rebel batteries*
Even twenty shells per day, falling into a
city, may serve to keep up an amount of
solicitude sufficient to derange business
and to make residence anything but com
fortable. And as this state -of things has
' gone on in this or some similar shape now
for some months, we may conclude that
the fire-eaters thcrcaways have got pretty
well used to it; and perhaps have* become
so accustomed to it as to enjoy it; and to
r realize thus the experience of that cele
brated personage in history who! was
never happy except when he was mis
erable.
But what does it amount to on onrside,
after all? Wc have had very sanguine ex
pectations In regard to Charleston several
limes. We have been promised itscap
„ tore in “a few days,” or “a week or two,”
or Christmas,” any number ot
times; and the people have fully believed
in these promises. Why have they so far
failed? and will they come to anything
in the future?
So far, we have gained this: Wc have
shut up the harbor as tight as a junk bottle
. with the cork driven in by a mallet; which
r is an immense practical gain; for Charles
ton was the worst port to guard on the
coast. Wc have the satisfaction, tod, of
having knocked Fort Sumter, where the
warbegan, into a pile of bricks; bo that for
offence it no longer amounts to anything.
We have also kept employed a goodly
rebel army to guard the place, and thus
been saved iheir operations elsewhere. The
rebels have also been forced to expend a
prodigious amount of resources in guns
and defences, and to bum a goodly pile of
powder; and thus to that extent been
weakened for offensive undertakings.
Bat we have not taken the city, and are
in no danger of taking it; nor have wc
been} for the past year. Koris this from
any want of zeal on the part of our mili
tary commanders there. Hunter would
have been glad enough to have moved
upon the place, but deemed luff forces too
, few; as they doubtless were. Gilmore,
with small reinforcements, buf with cvni
and indomitable pluck, has taken Morris
Island. But anybody who consults a map,
secs, as the first thing, that Morris Island
does not reach to Charleston, by about
four miles. Morris Island shuts the har
bor. Moms Island batters down Sumter.
It is a good foothold as against Moultrie
and the batteries 'over there, and against
those upon James' island. Bat to get to
Charleston, you most now go hy water.
But Gilmore is not a duck, and cannot
swim with all Ids guns on his back, and he
' comes to a dead slop and throws shells as
well as he can. Bat we cannot interpret
his shell throwing to mean much. As to
Sumter, it keeps the} rebels from erecting
• any works there. As to the city, he may
. bum it, and nobody this way would shed
_Bby tears. And Greek Fire was for a time
believed in, but it seems to have become
. ancient once more. As to “twenty shells
a day,” they need to be large ones; they
ought to hold a barrel apiece of the fire,
and that of a very fiery kind, to bum up
the place very quickly, when merely drop
ped into it from the air. So that Gilmore
has got to the end of his rope in that di
rection.
- “Butwhydoes not the Eavy go in?”
We do notknow. Perhaps it cannot iAs
to the “obstructions,” of which we read so
much, it is probable that they would be
pretty quickly disposed o£ were theyalL
But the truth is, that each shore and the
front of the city itself is lined with bat
teries, as formidable as the rebels in three
years have been able to make them; and,
though the monitors might go in, it is a
question what they could do when they
got there. So far, they have not tried it,
and, till they do, wc are forced to suppose
there is some reason better known to the
parties concerned than to the country at
large.
It is supposed that Charleston and
Savannah might be taken from the rear,
and that a force large enough would get
into the rear. Perhaps we ahull sec some
thing jet, if we wait long enough.
"But why don't our forces take Sum
ter?” Doubtless the place could betaken
wilh no very great difficulty. But the
man who raffled for the elephant, did not
find the difficulty to consist in getting the
beast, but in taking care of him afterwards.
It might not be a pretty job to take care of
Sumter, with Sullivan and James'lslands
and Fort Bilcy concentrating their fire
upon it It may be less expensive to keep
it dear by raining iron Upon its ruins from
Morris Island and the vessels.
From all the considerations of the case,
it is evident that the public will have to be
patient in regard to Charleston. To finish
it out may be tbc very last job of the war.
XST We were confident, at tho appearance
•of the President's message, that tbc Pref jdontial
Plan of “rcstorinc the Union'* was a contrivance
that wonld catch the radicals, but wo have waited,
with some cnrioßltv, as to the cfioct of its allure
ments upon the professed conservatives. We have
root had to wait long. The professed conservatives
have swallowed the bait, hook and al’. with no less
avidity than the Radicals, and wc behold "Horace
Greeley, Thnrlow Weed, Wendell Phillips, Mont
gomery Blair, William Lloyd Garrison, Henry j.
Raymond, Fred Douglas, and Lyman Trumbull,
all dwelling in delightful unity together around
Ihe central attraction of Old Abe.— Steeth Timet.
The wisdom of the President's plan of
reconstruction is thus proven by the entire
unanimity with which it is endorsed by all
shades of opinion among loyal men. Cop
periicads may howl and gnash their teeth
at the hearty support given to “ Old Abe's”
plan of restoring the revolted States to their
places in the Union, but their chagrin will
avail nothing. The “plan” is going to suc
ceed. The confession contained in the ex
tract from the rebel organ is the reluctant
testimony of a malignant enemy in behalf
of the sagacity and judgment of the Presi
dent The Copperheads fondly believed
that the great Union party would split to
pieces and founder on the rock of “recon
struction” the rebel paper with a ghastly
smile of disappointment, admits that no
such prospect longer exists; that the plan
unites all the dements of the Union party
into one harmonious organization.
DEPRECIATION OP CCIUIEKCT.
Secrctaiy Chase ascribes most of the ex
isting difference between the -value of
greenbacks and. gold to the circulation of
the trash of the “hetrogeneous banks,” as
be calls them. There is no doubt of the
troth of this statement If a legal tender
is worth to-day but 07 cents in coin, it is
because the lawful circulating medium of
the country is choked np and poisoned by
the presence of $250,000,000 of the due
bills of individuals, uttered in the sem
blance of money, and on which they draw
interest.
In another part of his Beport, the Secre
tory lays down this axiom:
“.When circulation exceeds the legitimate nv
qnlremeßU for real payments and exchanges, no
addition to Its volume wfll Increase Its value. On
the such addition tend* inevitably to do
predation; and -depredation, If addition be con
- tinned, wiD find its own practical limit in the utter
Worthlessness of the augmented mass.* 1
The paper circulation afloat at this time
amounts to six hundred and fifty milllons
worth in gold at 60 cents on the dollar a
little more than four hundred miiiiona, and
the amount of greenbacks in circulation is
Just about ibur hundred xnniions. Hence,
the currency Hb depredated to the extent
of the issues of the “hetrogeneous banks.”
The/ have, therefore, inflicted adeteriora
lion of one-third on the circulating medi
um. If Congress would do its duty and
tax this pestiferous stuff out of circulation}
the value oflegal tender notes would at once
begin to rise, and when the trash was all
banished, greenbacks would be up to gold.
.But Secretary Chase could throw into the
vacuum two hundred minions more of
legal tendernotes, thereby givingthe country
a uniform currency and the Government a
loan of that amount without interest; and
that too without swelling the volume of
the currency, but, on the contrary, con
tracting it by fifty or more millions, which
would reduce the price of gold ten or fif
teen percent Will a law tarring the issues
of “hetrogeneons banks’* so heavily as to
drive them, out of circulation, be passed?
or is it possible that the wild-cat influence
in the halls of Congress is superior to the
public good?
EAST TENNESSEE.
The President is vastly delighted tha t
East Tennessee is taken and possessed by
onr troops, and rails upon the country to
give thanks for what tie estc&ns so great an
accomplishment.
“Why don’t the Government take pos
session of East Tennessee and give relief
to those suffering loyal people?” is a ques
tion asked hundreds of times for two
years. The newspapers called frantically
upon the government to push a column
into that region; and thought it indicated
a want of military perception and energy
that it did not Perhaps it did. But so
far as the President is concerned, the cen
sure of not seeing the point, and of not
endeavoring to secure it, must not apply to
him. He saw it at the outset, and got a
law through Congress for a railroad through
Kentucky to Cumberland Gap, with this
very end in view. But such was the hor
ror of the country of government under
takings which involved large outlays for
such purposes, gathered from our experi
ences ofthc rotten venality and stealings in
the days of Pierce and Buchanan, that the
plan was clamored down. Bat to reach
East Tennessee has never been; lost
eight ofi We have been more than two
years at it; and the reason why we have
not got it sooner, is that] with the instru
mentalities we were using we could not
It was what Buell, with his half-earnest
heart and coppery brain was trying after.
He got once to Chattanooga, so that he
threw shells into the town across the river.
But Bragg was enough for such as Buell,
and he took his flank, and pushed him
square back into Louisville. Bosecrans
then took hold, and Bragg found him an
other sort of article. He worked him along
backwards, and in a year got him over the
Tennessee. Many thought he might have
done it sooner. Some say the government
was impatient, and that his slowness led
to Ins removal But this is certain, that if
Rosccrans is cautious, and will not move
until he is fully ready, he Mi what he got,
and East Tennessee .is ours. Chlckamauga
gained it; Chattanooga secures it We
donl think the rebels will evaf get it again.
We may well be- thankful.
ABItAHAiTT PATBUBCH.
While Abraham Lincoln seems fully bent
on wiping out the patriarchal institution,
so called, he is not oblivious of patriarchal
practices and example where they were
dearly good and worthy of imitation.
Abraham Lincoln wishes to save the lines
of the seceded States from the destruction
hy loyal fire and brimstone with which
they are threatened; and In his plan
plainly followed in the footsteps of the
older Abraham Patriarch. For he claimed
that the cities of the plain, Sodom and Go
morrah, though almost as wicked as the
seccsh States, should be spared, if there
could be found within them ten righteous
souls. So our good Abraham proclaims
that our Sodoms of revolt, and Gomozrahs
of treason, our rebellious and stiff-necked
States, shall not be utterly overthrown and
destroyed, if so he one-tenth only of their
people are found to be righteous souls.
Let those who mourn sore over the extin
guishment of the patriarchal institution of
our sort, find comfort in witnessing how
the patriarchal example is followed in
another.
Letter rrom SL Jeff* Thompson—He
Wants to Bead tbe Tribune.
One of the editors of the Tbiuune has the
honor of a personal acquaintance with the
redoubtable M. Jeff Thompson, who for so
many months, with hie ragged, hungry
horde of “butternuts” so harried our loyal
people in Southeast Missouri. The follow
ing letter from the former Mayor of St Jo
seph, was received last week, and as it was
not marked “ confidential,” we lay it in fall
before our readers:
JOSKSOS'S Tbt.avd, otib SAXDtraST, 0_ »
Thursday, Dec. 8,1863. )
——, Editor Chicago Tribune:
Deab Sib —Of course yon remember me,
end therefore are not surprised at hearing
from me. (1) I want yon to send me your
while I am the guestof Uncle Sam,
that I may hear all the good news that you
may hare to tell. (2) I will promise you
that yon will not convert me to your faith,
but 1 am anxious to hear “ both sides of the
story, ” that 1 may know that 1 am not be
nighted, even though I persist in being a reb
el. (S) I will not tempt you with Confed
erate notes or Missouri War Bonds, and the
little Greenbacks which I have have been
given me by some kind hearted friends, to
supply me with such creature comforts as
Uncle Sam fails to issue, and therefore 1
trust to your desire to Spread the Truth to
get your paper. (4) Ido not suppose "that
your political' differences interfere with
yourperaonalrelations with the Editor of
the Timor, therefore I ask you to ask him (as
I do not know him personally) to sendmehis
paper also, for fear yon may seduce mo from
the way which yon say he wants me to go.
\ still have the most lively cad kindly re
collection of my visit to Chicago, when I was
the guest of your Board of-Trade—and lam
fully convinced that the Andobon Club feeds
its guests much better than Uncle Samuel
docs his. However, as being a prisoner is the
least of all the many trials,* troubles and
misfortunes of war, I will not complain,
though It frets me as much as it does anv
body? (C) .
I hope all of the members of the Society of
St. Joseph have not “gone down to the
wars”; and any of them that arc left must
receive my kind regards. (7) I pray that
the day may soon come when the North and
the South can extend such courtesies to each
other ss the cities of Chicago and St Joseph
did, in days gone by; fori would be your
friendly neighbors, though we can never be
brothers again. (8)
With many wishes for your personal suc
cess, and political defeat, I am (9) yours most
respectfully, M. Jeff. Thompson,
Brig. Gen. M. 8. G.
- UZPLT.
1. Certainly wo remember yon, Jeff, and
from the moment of our first acquaintance in
your office, when Mayor of St, Joseph, Mo.,
your long, lank personality has ever been
firmly fixed, so that we could Identify yon
anywhere.
2. Ton shall have the Tbxbitxe, Jeff, and if
you remain at your “ pleasant island borne”
beyond the time for which, yon will see It
marked on the labelj and we foiget to re
new, drop ns a line and we will most cheer
fully extend your “ subscription,” especially
if, as in this case, you make your correspond
ence decidedly interesting. But before that,
wc tell yon kindly and deciddy, we hope the
doom of all traitors will be fixed.
8. Bony we are, Jeff, that you so persist
There arc many things about you that we
like, and while you were reveling in pillage
and slaughter, and perpetrating the most
awful crimes against God and man, we often
thought of yon, and wondered bow yon
could do it Wc shall send yon the Tbibuxe,
hoping that yon, vile traitor as yon have
made yourself “ may return” to a realizing
sense of the fiendish crimes you have com
mitted. .
4. Well, Jeff., if XJnde Sam does not ftir
nish you with the luxuries, be certainly
■ gives you the substantlals of life, and an abun
dance of lb cm. In tbis regard your treat
•ment is in striking contrast to the
eavageiy which your “ Confederate'* knaves
mete out to our noble prisoners at tbe South.
History will have no language sufficiently
strong and scathing to describe that contrast.
If to correct that horrid brutality a little
wholesome- starvation is visited npon
yon, do not wonder, and *if still a per
sistent rebel, yon should not repine.
It is not in human nature always to
endure tbe absolute daily starvation
of scores .of oar noble eons and brothers
amid the horrid filtb'and disgusting vermin
of your Southern “block holes,” while! you
and those about you, are reveling in the fit
of the land, Wamyonr Confederate fiends
In time, of the retaliatory doom that may
await you. Yon may force the North to
deeds which In their abhor, i •
5. The editor of the Titties reads the Tsm
usx and will therefore. duly, we have no
doubt, honor yonr request He is your
friend, if one bo devoid of every other noble,
patriotic sentiment 1 can cherish the feeling
of friendship. At the very conunehcomast
of this war, to nee his own language, he com
menced his “fire in the rear’ 1 upon our
noble armies, and he has kept it np ever
since with every power of his soul, and every
means at his command. *He has confessedly
done the rebel cause more efficient and valu
able service than any paper at the South. He
has really been worth more to it than an army
of twenty-thousand men. If the traitors who
have murdered onr friends and brothers by
scores of thousands do not destroy the best
government on earth, it will be because the
ability of the Times editor, and Us associate
traitors, is not equal to the intense malignity
which they constantly cherish in their hearts.
As vUlanously rebel os they have dared
to be, history will brand them as
meaner- and more ' despicable than you,
who are in some measure expiating your
’ crimes on Johnson's Island. They may be
safely left to the contempt of all honest men,
and the infinite scorn with which our patri
otic army in the field, or again at home as
citizens, will hunt them to the tomb.
6. As Jeff Thompson, ■ the Mayor of St
Joseph, wc, and wc have no doubt the Board
of Trade, “ still have the most lively and
kindly recollections of your visit to Chicago
but as a rebel brigand, as you were many
months before, your capture, and still ding
' ingto your treason, “you are our enemy and
we are very respectfully yours," It will take
a vast deal of repentance on your part and
faith on ours, to make any change in oar rela
tions hereafter.. J.
7. So pleasant was the visit of the delega
tion of the Chicago Board of Trade to St Jo
seph, Mo., at the opening of the Hannibal &
St Joseph Bailroad, that on theirreturn, they
formed themselves into a society, called the
“Society of St Joseph,” of which Geo.
E. Stanton, Esq., is the President They.; are
not all gone to the war, Jeff, but without an
exception, bo far as we know, every one of
them is thoroughly loyal and doing what he
can to put down this most infamous rebellion.
Death for its leaders and unconditional sub
mission for all others engaged in the rebel
lion, is the motto of all onr people, except
the Times editor, and the infamous crow that
surround Mm.
8. For' the terms of future good fellow
ship which you propose, you may as well
cease to pray. Wc can never be broth
ers with those who with sacrilegious hands
have grasped at the life of the mother who
bore ns. .Ton have forfeited yonr birthright,
Jeff; bnt the loyal children of the household
ore determined that the glorious inheritance
bequeathed to them shall be preserved intact;
that the ensign, of onr venerable old mother
shall waVc in triumph from the Lakes to the
Gnl£ from the Atlantic to the Pacific. A
few more months and it is hoped that free
dom and peace will again bless onr- ocean
bound Republic.
9. Personally, we beg to assure you that we
have the most kindly feelings towards yon,
'Jeff, and hence no words to express onr sor
row that yon persist in being a venomous
traitor. As to political opinions, as under
stood on onr first acquaintance, wc have
none. Wc are simply patriots all, engaged
in the holy purpose of saving onr conntiy
from destruction by a pack of the most vil
lainous traitors that ever cursed the earth.
When that is accomplished it will be time
enough for ns to become split np upon minor
and merely political issues. Hoping, there
fore, and laboring unceasingly for the early
and complete destruction of your infamous
Confederacy, and with best wishes that the
loyal teachings of the Tbibuke may convert
yon from the fatal opinions into which yon
have been betrayed, we commend yon to the
mercies of Providence, and the Justice of
your country, whose laws and whose inesti
mable privileges yon have so basely defied.
The National Intelligencer on the
message.
The ItiteUigencer says It has not had time to
ponder the views of the President with the
care which their complexity and importance
demand, and adds:—“We are frank to say,
however, that, on a first perusal, the general
tone of the message under this head strikes
vs favorably, and, while we are not at all san
guine as to the degree of success which is
likely to attend the particular mode of pro
ceeding marked out by the President for the
“reconstruction of the Union," it is gratify
ing to find that he gives no place in his sys
tem to that pestilent political heresy which
proposes to obliterate State lines in the
South."
Chase and the Heterogeneous «■«!r«,
TVe extract in full what Secretary Chase
says in bis Report in relation to the shin
plaster circulations called “ banks/* It will
be seen that much the greater part of the
difference between the value of “green
backs ** and gold is caused by the "issues of
the heterogeneous banks. If their circulation
were retired, legal-tender and gold would
approximate very nearly to one value. He
says:
Much the greater part of the rise of prices
not accounted lor by the causes just stated,
as well as much the greater part of the differ
ence between notes and gold, is attributable
to the large amount of bank notes vet in cir
culation. Were these notes withdrawn from
use, it is believed that much of the now very
considerable difference between coin and
United States notes would disappear. Cer
tainly there ought to be no difference in favor
of coin, when it is remembered that United
States bonds bearing six, or even fire per
cent, coin Interest, are intrinsically worth,
unless the theoiy of national bad faith or na
tional insolvency is to be admitted, more
than their amount iu coin; and yet such
bonds can now be had for their amount in
United States notes.
Nor can a condition of affairs in which ex
cessive prices prevail, or national notes com
mand less than par in coin, be regarded as of
permanent duration. While it lasts, it must
be borne with patience, and made tolerable
by economy. No useful remedy will be
found in extravagant increase of salaries and
disbursements, but an aggravation rather of
the eviL All proper measures should be
adopted to hasten the return to the normal
condition of prices and business; the patri
otism and intelligence of the people must be
relied on for tbc rest
The Secretary has heretofore expressed the
opinion that whatever may be the true degree
in which the currency of the country affected
by a bank-note circulation, issued without
national sanction and by corporations inde
pendent of national authority, and not receiv
able for national dues, it cannot be question
ed that in some similar degree thenegotiation
of national loons must be prejudiced and their
value to the national finances diminished
This opinion is confirmed by observation and
csmcricncc.
• Impelled, therefore, by a profound sense of
the present necessity of a national currency
to the successful prosecution of the war
against rebellion, and of its utility at all times
ip protecting labor, cheapening exchanges,
facilitating travel, and increasing the safety
of all bnsmess transactions; and at the same
time unwilling to mgo even salutary and nec
essary reforms in such a way as needlessly to
disturb existing conditions or impair the val
ue of existing investments of capital, the Sec
retary recommended, in two successive re
ports, the authorization of national banking
associations, to which the capital of the cor
porationa now issuing notes for circulation
might be transferred, with advantage to the
parties Interest as well as to the general pub
■ The sanction of Congress was given to
these views at the last session; and the sim
ple assurance thus given that, henceforth,
the country is to have a national currency se
cured by a pledge of.natiouol bonds, and the
belief that this currency will at no distant
day take the place of the heterogeneous cor
porate currency which has hitherto filled the
channels of circulation, at once inspired
faith in the securities of the Government, and
more than any other one cause enabled the
Secretary to provide for the prompt payment
of the soldiers and the public creditors.
If the policy thus indicated shall be fairly
and judiciously pursued,-and proper meas
ures adopted to induce the conversion, at
the earliest practicable period, of the bank
corporations of the States into national
banking associations, and of the corporate
circulation into national currency, tho Secre
tary believes, and, as he thinks, not without
good grounds, that all the money needed for
prompt payment of troops, and for the most
vigorous prosecution of the war, can be 'ob
tained by loans on reasonable terms; while
all interest on debt, and all ordinary expendi
tures. and a considerable part also of the ex
traordinary expenditures caused by this war,
will be met by the ordinary resources. Nor
docs he doubt that, thrbhgb wise legislation,
sustained by intelligent popular will, and
supported by prudence and energy in civil
and military administration, national cur
rency con be so approximated in recognized
value to coin, that a resumption of payments
in specie can be brought about much sooner
than even sanguine persons now permittbem
sclves to hope.
Gen. Grant on_tbe Corner-Stone of tbo
Rebellion*
The following extract of a private letter of
General Grant to the Hon. E. B. Washburn e,
dated August 13,1803, seta at rest the ques
tion of veracity raised by the Herald with
Senator Wilson, who gave the substance with
out giving the exact language of it in a re
cent speech:
The people of the North need not quarrel
over the institution of slavery. What Vice
President Stephens acknowledges os the cor
ner-stone, of the Confederacy is already
knocked 6uL Slavery is already dead, and
cannot be resurrected. It would take a
standing army to maintain, slavery in the
South if we were to moke peace to-day guar
anteeing to the South all their former consti
tutionar privileges. I never was an Aboli
tionist—not even what would be called Antl-
Slavcir—but I try to Judge fairly and honest
ly, and it became patent to my mind, early in
the rebellion, that the North and South could
never live at peace with each other except as
one nation, and that without slavery. As
anxious as I am to see peace established, 1
would not, therefore, be willing to sec any
settlement until. this question is forever
settled..

COMMITTEE ON WATS AND MEANS.
The chairmanship of this Committee, it is
understood, will Be offered to Mr. Washburne,
of Illinois; but it is said by bis most inti
mate friends that be will decline it, prefer
ring that of Commerce, which be held last
year.
NOTICES OF BILLS—CONSCRIPTION ACT AND
■ SLAVERY.
Senator Lane of Kansas, in the Senate, and
slr. Arnold of Illinois, in the House, have
both given notice of bills to repeal os much
of the enrollment act as authorized the dis
charge of a person drafted, on payment of
three hundred dollars. Senator Lane’s bill
also provides .for increasing the pay of the
army fifty per cent
Hr. Arnold also gave notice of a bill pro
hibiting slavciy In all the Territories included
In the President’s Proclamation of Emanci
pation. -
The three hundred dollar clause in the con
scription act, will doubtless be repealed this
session. It was a blunder originally. !
FRAUDS ON THE GOVERNMENT—INTE3TIGA-
TION DEMANDED.
The immense frauds on the Government
constantly coming to light, ore exciting the
attention of members of both parties.! Mr.
Covode, of the celebrated investigating'com
mittee, is here, and, I learn, preparing a hill
calling for a thorough investigation of all
frauds T upon the Government It will be
E resented at an early day. and will no donht
e passed. The lately discovered .frauds at
Alexandria in the commissary department,
have swelled to gigantic proportions, having
already, I learn, reached a million dollars.
Captains Gay, Carey, two Captains Stoddard
and Captain Ferguson, the latter Chief Quar
termaster, have been arrested and lodged in
prison. A rigid investigation of all similar
transactions, of whatever character, is imper
atively demanded. .
ANOTHER GREAT ABUSE TO BE CORRECTED.
I learn that another great abuse which
Congress will correct during the present ses
sion, is the keeping in the service of an im
mense number of military officers who have
ho commands, and who simply draw their
pay. For instance take the district of Penn
sylvania. In that district, in which there is
' but one brigade of troops, I find tbere are
the following officers: —Maj. Gen. Couch,
commanding; Mai, Gen. Cadwollader; Maj.
Gen. Slgel; Afaj. Gen. Dana; Brig. Generals
FIU-Henry Warren, Whipple and Hatch. :At

AN ON DIT.
It is rumored here that a late Treasurer of
Illinois, is making immense sums of money
by speculating in cotton with a sort of exclu
sive permit at Memphis. The question is
•who gave him such is it proper
that no should have it? Has he not made
enough out of his Illinois office, into which
he went as poor as a rat, but come out as
rich as Croesus? Zeta.

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL
THE HONEY MARKET*
Monday Etxntno , Dee. 14,1383.
The demand for money to-day has been nnnsn
ally heavy; so much so that some of the hankers
have sold New York Exchange to each other at par
to keep up a supply of currency. There is no
surplus of Exchange, and some bouses hold the
selling-rate firm at while others sell round lots
at 3-16@l-5. The buying range Is nar®t-10; hut
most purchases were made at par. The general
money market Is exceedingly close; and is likely
to be eo certainly till the packing season is over.
The Telegraph gave us hut one quotation from
Wall street, fbr Gold, making it at 11 a. m., 149*£,
We refer to our late dispatches on the first page
for the closing quotations. The rale hero was
quite uniform at 148, though some may have paid a
fraction above.
• Silver Legal Tender Notea being nom
inal at 1-10, selling
At Mn-WAUKEZ.—The Sentinel of yesterday
says: The condition of tho money market towards
the dose of last week was very much Improved,
hut the supply of currency was still far inadequate
to meet the demand. The nominal rate of inter*
est was 7 per cent, but those who borrowed had
generally to pay. enough in .“commissions” to
bring the interest actually up to 10@12 per cent.
Money readily commands these rates' in Chicago,
and there is, of course, no reason why it should
hot command just as much here, the statutes to
the contrary, notwithstanding. ;
At Bt. Loots.— Monetary, affairs dull, and but
little demand for money. New York Exchange In
small supply. . .
At CxsciKHATi.—The GazeiU says: Exchange
rules steady at K®l-10 discounts buying and par
selling. . The supply and demand were, abont
equal.. .Money was in fair demand at 6@3 inside,
and 9(^lo' outside.. Government securities were
lees firm, but holders were not disposed to sell,
preferring to.borrow at 6 per 'cent' on collaterals.
We quote orders 3K and vouchers 3@3tfdls.
The Pripabatiok or ora NatiosAl Ctransf

plied, which will probably be accomplished within
the next two months, that all associations will be
famished with notes within thirty days from the
time bonds are deposited. with the Treasurer.
, Contracts have been made with the Continental

the plates for the $5, $lO, S2O, SSO, and SIOO notes”
and tho printing of the fives and tens has been

through the banks the people will soon bo put in

think tbe falling off will be large enough to insure
profitable result*.

CHICAGO CATTLE MARKET.
HOGS—From the transactions in the stock
yards since Saturday last, wo note a considerable
improvement In the dull and depressed condition
which characterized the clo;o of our last week's
daily market. Of the largo number of hogs left
over on Saturday evening in the yards—from the
entered soles wc find that 18,751 have since been
sold; besides which a rather large number have
been shipped through to other markets on owner's
account. There has been olsq considerably more
activity especially among packers, and on
prime and extra qualities an advance of
lO&lCc upon our previous quotations has been
conceded. From the list of sales we find that
prices have ruled from $0.65@5.73 per 100 lbs, but
that the bulk ofllogs have been sold at 54.63&5.15.
In the sales at Sherman's Yards there has liken a
very marked superiority in the general qualities of
the Hogs sold, and the almost entire absence of
anything like inferior stock. In the Southern
Yards, we especially noted a lot of 253 White
Chester and Berkshire Hogs, as one of the finest
droves brought in this season, part of which were
fed In Bureau county, and the remainder in Peoria
'county, Illinois, and are being offered by Mr. T.
Nicoles for sale, the average weight being abont
£3O lbs. This evening they were unsold. The
cold, bracing weather which has so opportunely
superseded the rough and miserable style of Sat
urday and of yesterday, has given an additional
stimulus to the market, and at all events has ena
bled ns to start the week well, whatever may be
the ending.
