situation by Kaynor, of Maryland, and

the last session. As a mark of further

FOR NEW TREATY.
President Roosevelt Said To Be Ne
gotiating One With Japan,
Chicago, IVe. ".A dispatch to the
Tribune from Washington savs:
iscount Aoki, the Japanese ambas
sador, went to the lnte House yes
terday at the invitation of the presi
dent. Thev discussed a pmpoeition to
negotiate an entirely new treaty, spe
cifically recognmnir the right ol each
country to exclude the laborers of the
other.
Such a provision is contained in the
present treaty, but the president and
the Japanese amlw-ssmlor thought it
would satisfy the pride uf the Jajtanese
if their right to treat the Americans
as the Americans treat them were re
ognized.
It was also believed that a new
treaty would please the jeople of Cali
fornia and show them thai the presi
dent is prepared to go to the extent of
excluding coolie Japanese if it should
become necessary. Such a treaty would
receive but little opposition in the sen
ate.
It would almost inevitably be fol
lowed by a Japanese exclusion law bar
ring out all laborers from the mikado's
islands. Our laborers would thereupon
ie barred by Japan.
