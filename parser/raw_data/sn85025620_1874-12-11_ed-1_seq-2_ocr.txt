FRIDAY, DECEMBER 11,1874.
Important Announcement.
We hare completed an arrangement with the
Publishers of the ST A E S S the
leading paper of the Northwest, whereby we are
enabled to furnish tho WOIITIHNGTON ADVANCE,
and the PRESS, postpaid, after January 1, 1875,
for the low pi ice of THKEB Dollars per year.—
This will enableour readers to secure two papers
at but little more than the price of one.
EVERYBODY should at once a*ail themselves of
this very liberal offer. Come forwaid all and
subscribe.
On the first day of the session of
Congress, Mr. Hitchcock introduced
a bill in the Senate appropriating
$100,000 for the relief of the grass
hopper sufferers on the western Iron
tier. The bill also directs the issue
of disused army clothing to supply
the extreme wants of suffeiers. This
is well enough, as far as it goes, but
it is not half enough. It will take
much more than that amount to re
lieve the Minnesota sufferers alone,
and we are well off compared with
poor Kansas and Nebraska.
PRESIDENT 8 Mt&SA GE.
We give, on our first page, the
President's Message, lead to Congress
on Monday. The President reaffirms
the position taken in his veto of the
currency bill anU desiies a speedy re
turn to specie payment. He is tired
of using the power of the General
Government to keep the lebels of the
South in order, and also of endeavor
ing to enfoice civil sen ice refoim.—
But we sincerely hope he will fight it
out on this line if it takes all the rest
of his term. It is always unpleasant
to do an unpleasant duty, but it is
sure to yield the peaceable fruits of a
good conscience and ultimately of an
approving public sentiment.
ANOTHER MASSACRE.
Accounts come of another massa
cre of coloied men in the South. TLe
whole affair seems to have been ad
mirably planned so as to get the ne-so
groes out and make them appear to
be the aggressors. Then they were
fallen upon and some sixty were mas
sacred, while but one Ku Klux devil
bit the dust. It is almost enough to
make one lose faith in the justice of
Heaven to see how the poor negro is
given over to the knife and the pistol
of the bloody Ku Klux assassins
The South is furnishing one of the
bloodiest pictures in the book of Time.
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.
A correspondent of the Minneapo
lis Tribune, writing from Hastings,
says:
If our early settlers and town pro
prietors had taken as much interest at
an early day in scciu ing the location
of educational institutions as they now
express for the location of some kind
of manufacturing establishments, our
city would have been far more ad
vanced in population and wealththan
it now is.
This is sensible talk. They should
have done manufactures and not have
left educational institutions undone.
And this is just what the founders of
the National Colony have aimed at
from the first. We must have good
educational institutions at all hazards,
and have them as a means of promot
ing our mateiial interests, if for no
higher reason. But there are infinite
ly higher considerations which bave
been the main inducement in all the
efforts of this people to secure good
educational facilities. Worthington
may be made the educational centre
for a number of counties in this"gar
den spot of the west, and the Wor
thington Seminary, as the initial in
stitution of learning, ought to have
the prayeis and the best efforts of
the community for its speedy revival
and its establishment upon a perma
nent basis.
OUR NARROW UA UGE RAILROAD
The Estherville Vindicator says:
The Worthington Ad\ ance is woik
ing up a narrow-gauge railroad from
Woithington to the coal fields at Ft.
Dodge. No use, Mr. man, you will
probably get your coal, a? at present,
or via of Wriidom and the Valley of
the Des Moines.
We have no objection whatever to,
a narrow-gauge railroad up the
Des-H.
rooines Valley connecting with the
Sioux City & St. Paul road at
Win-ical
dom or any other convenient point.
Nor do we see that, if built, it need
interfere with a narrow-gauge road
from Worthington to Fort Dodge
Both roads are undoubtedly needed,
and would be paying investments.—
If the people along the proposed lines
can do their share toward the con
struction, we have no doubt that cap
ital can be enlisted to iron and stock
the roads.
The Windom Reporter, alluding to
the subject, saj s:
One of the best routes for a narrow
auge railroad in the West is from
'ort Dodge, Iowa, via Jackson, Win
dom and Lake Shetek to the Winona
A St. Peter railroad. The object of
such a route is very manifest. The
whole of Southwestern Minnesota is
a vast treeless prairie, now rapidly
settling up, and is dependent on the
Big Woods for fuel, which in a few
years must exhaust its supply. At
Fort Dodge we reach the nearest coal
mines in Iowa, and a railroad extend
ing from there over the route sugges
ted, would prove of inestimable ben
efit to the country. Cheap fuel is es
sential to the rapid development of
this country, and the cheapness with
which a narrow-gauge railroad can be
built, equipped and operated, render
the construction of such roads an im
mediate necessity in the West, as not
only a means for cheapening trans
portation, but supplying communities
with rapid communication where a
broad gauge road could not be profit
ably built. We see no reason why
a narrow-gauge road over the pro
posed route could not become a pay
ing investment soon after its comple
tion, in the moA ing of fuel alone, to
which would necessarilybe added a
large ti'ansfer of merchandise.
All the Reporter says of the pro
posed Desmoines Valley road, of
course, applies with equal force to our
proposed nariow-gauge. The feasi
bility of these roads is beyond ques
tion, and there can be no doubt of the
immense benefit which regions like
our o\n will cleiive from their con
struction.
We are glad to see such a ready re
sponse fiom our exchanges.* And the
columns of the ADVANCE aie open to
suggestions upon this subject, and we
hope that piactical men will avail
themselves of the opportunity and
gh their views.
THE NATIONAL COLONY
Mr. A. M. Gibbons, who has been
tiaveling over the West the past sea
son, and who visited this section last
Summer, wiites us fiom Peoria, Illi
nois, under date of November ICth,
that there is no portion of the West
so inviting as this. He says:
I desire to say, after visiting most
of the new countiy of the West, that
there is none so inviting, taking all
things into consideiation, as 3 our sec
tion of the Stj»te of Minnesota. Its
fertility cannot be surpassed. Then
its healthful and invigorating climate
is another attraction Theie is no
doubt, but that it will settle up at
once. The grasshopper, about which
much complaint is now made, is
only a temporary objection, and their
presence and influence will soon pass
away and be foi gotten.
SUFFERING IN NEBRASKA.
A correspondent of the Toledo
Commercial wiites as follows from
Lincoln, Nebraska, concerning the
suffciing in that State:
come 20 miles to get food and cloth
ing for his wife and children fiom the
supplies shipped there fiom Omaha.
It was along journey for the hungry,
naked man and for his half-starved
brutes but when he arrived and found
nothing left, he sat down in despair
and cried like a child. Professor
McKenzie met theie Colonel DudlejT,
who was in search of facts they visi
ted the homes of the destitute togeth
er, when facts sad enough told them
that already theie had been death
from starvation that mothers and
childien in many instances had not
sufficient clothing to hide their nak
edness that their hoises and mules
are too weak to cairy them away, had
they sufficient clothing to protect
them from the severe winter weather
already set in and that, unless food
and clothing shall soon go to them,
starvation will count its victims by
the thousands.
Whatever is to be done, should be
quickly done. Chicago, a great city,
with wealth enough to take caie of
its poor in the hour of trial, speedily
and grandly succored. That^ was
good. Ncbiaska, unable to help it
self—Shall it perish?
CONTRIB UTWJS 8 EXPRESSED FREE.
Chas M. Fargo, Superintendent of
the American Express Company,
sends the following to the Chicago
Evening Journal:
Referring to the appeal in behalf of
the grasshopper sufferers in Nobles
county, Minn in your last evening's
edition, the American Express Com
pany will transport free of charge,
contributions of bedding, clothing and
food, delivered at their office, 12, 74
and T6 Monroe stieet addressed to I.
P. Dm fee. Chairman Board of Coun
ty Commissioner, TForthington, No
bles county, Minn.
We are shocked to learn that Dr.
H. Kimball has been considerably^
ruined by the Hennepin County Med-
Society for permitting his name
to be mentioned in a complimentary
manner by the Minneapolis newspa
pers. He has been very skillful in
surgery and those omnipresent and
omni-tattling newspapers said so,
wheieat the members of the Medical
Society who were not complimented
flew into a passion and reprimanded
him. We hope the Doctor has man
liness enough to hurl the reprimand
back into their teeth and stand upon
his own merits. It is high time that
in this age of newspapers and progress
this old-fogy, dark-age "professional"
foolishness were abandoned. The
Hennepin County Medieval Society
would probably be a more appropri
ate name for this organization.
The beautiful weather continues.
