The taxation of the profit products

to be a matterof discussion anioujr the
Ieople and will no doubt be one of the
questions that will influence the next
campaign so far as the choice of leg
islators may be concerned.
It is a. striking and interesting fact
that the first year of the presidential
term of President McKinley is signal
'zed by the exportation to P'urope of
American tin plate, whose manufac

The Kansas Board of Agriculture
anrscHinces that the' combined value of

'"The Republicans of Arizona are as

That is well said. The Republicans of
Arizona are in earnest in this matter
even though they have a representa
tive in Congress opposed to them and
who is seeking to secure the political
spoils for his following rather than
the rights of citizenship to the people
of the Territory.
The courts and the legal fraternity
of California are not beyond redemp
tion even if they are at times strangly
erratic. An attorney named I;oone of
fered not long since to sell the bus-
uess secrets of his client. Bowers, in
to the possession of which he had come
by virtue of his profession and busi
ness relations with that client. Judge
Morrow, on complaint of Bowers and
hearing of the case, forever disbarred
Boone from practicing in the courts of
California.
It is highly essential, if this valley
would do anything for the improve
ment of itselt.tuat an earnest attempt
should Ik' made to secure capital for
beet sugar manufactory and that our
farmers should be at once interested
in sugariieet cunure. it nas oeen suf
ficiently demonstrated that the sugar
lH'et is a success m this valley with
proper cultivation, ami not oniy a suc-
s but more of a success than in
other places wheresugar is being man
ufactured from them iu large quanti
ties. Now is the time to urge, now
the time to concentrate and organ

on on earth wliv .vrizona snoum not
(io as well as eitner ot Tiiem iu sugar
culture, except theevcrlasting and un
manly indifference born of a superla
tive "selfishness and a miserable lack
of healthful enterprise. The sugar
beet takes little irrigation, not more
than grain, and should yield the grow
er at per ton about $150 per acre.
However the growers can do nothing
till a factory is assured and to our lo
ll capitalists must we look for this;
through their efforts the money will
be forthcoming without great delay
for a sugar factory. Our Chamber of
Commerce would do well to take this
matter up at once.
Our Live StockSaniiary Commission
is one ot the useful organizations of:
the Territory and has saved hundreds
of thousands of dollars to the live
stock industry of Arizona.
Taxpaying times always bring on
stringency of money about the valley
and this is especially noticeable this
year.
It turns out lhat Mr. McKinley was
very much displeased at the sermon he
heard on Thanksgiving day by the
Iter. Johnson who made the mistake
of giving a laudatory discourse on the
President who sat in the iew before

appropriate to the day.

TT:wl President McKinley followed
the example of his immediate pre
decessor, who rarely finished one of
his messages to Congress until the
d.-iv befor- Cor;rress met, his message
a "
w O'lld not have been ready, but he
completed the message a week ago
and did not have that on his mind
while travelling to the bedside of his
stricken mother, from which he re
turned to Washington to perform the
.lutioe incumbent unon him at the
nneninir of the session of Congress.
As soon as those duties were perform
ed he started for Canton again, to
perform a more painful duty, carrying
with him the sorrowful sympathies of
the whole country.
The University of California as in
all its departments is exceedingly rich
iu material and exiierience iu its agri
cultural department which has been in
existence and carefully handled for
the pasttwenty-t wo years. AVe are in
receipt of Bulletin No. lis from 1'rof.
Ililgard. the eminent scientist who
has direction of that college, in which
is enumerated a large quantity of
frees, shrubs and vim s to be had in
exchange for something the Univer
sity desires in like lines. Among other
things is noted the camphor tree, some
twenty varieties of new I'ersion table
grapes from the table l.-uids of Persia,
resistent. vines, dry land grasses, for
age plants for alkali soils, fibre plants,
"garden vegtables, tc, tc. Our own
University at Tucson would do well
to set up a lively exchange with the
Agricultural department of the Cali
fornia institution as from that source
the experimental stations of the Ter
ritory could be supplied with much
that might be new and useful here iu
Arizona.
In addition to getting a first-class
man to till the lmtiortant position or
Attornev General, President McKin-
iey's choice of Gov. John AV. Griggs.
of X. J. to fill the vacancy in the Cabi
net made by the nomination of Attor
nev General McKenna to succeed Jus
tice Field, who retired from the U.
Supreme Court last week.after hav
ing served there longer than any of
his predecessors, is considered to be a
sood political move one that will aid
materially in keeping New Jersey In
the Republican column, and the wish
is general that Gov. Griggs will ac
cept the tendered portfolio.
Ex-Senator Bruce, of Mississippi,
must have been Uoru uuder a wnoie
iralaxv of lucky stars. Three times
has been register of the Treasury,
under different Presidents. His lite is
one ot romance, lie was uoru in oiti
Virginia, far back iu 1-S41. His ances
tors were slaves, and he was horn in
bondage, and yet this negro boy. a
member of a despised race, acquired a
university training, went Pack to .Mis-
ippi, and became a planter, and in
the course of time represented that
reat commonwealth on the lloor ot
the United Stales Senate the only
olorcd man who has ever held the
igiuhe! ornce ot rsenator. AO one
in appreciate t lie. test tins man was
put lo when he took his place ill the
Senate Chamber. The majority of the
Southern Senators treated him with
contempt, and in the minds ot many
Xorthern members there was a doubt
is to whciher he properly appreciated
tin- dr. ties and dirndl v of the ofiice he
trying to fill. And yet in a short
me he won the respect of a majority
f the members of that chamber.
Courteous and kim!. ever mimlfiiJ of
the rights of others, a master of his
subject when he look part in debate,
it must be said of Bruce, in all fair
ness, lhat lie lived up to the full meas
ure of his otlice. He is the recent ap
liointee of President McKinley for
Kegister of the Treasury which posi
tion he now holds for the third time.
Under the circumstances he is one of!
the remarkable men ol the line.
Senator AVhite of California has en
gaged iu a fight against the admission
of the Hawaiian Islands thus distinct
ly lining himself up with that combin
ation of sugar capitalists with the
Spreckles family at its head who have
secured the iree import oi ineiiav aim
product into the United States and
are endeavoring to and do largely con
trol the islands themselves to their
personal benefit. Senator Hoar, of
Massachusetts, is another of this
crowd who are fighting the admission
:f the islands because they think they
in make more out of those islands
is they now exist. The sugar trust
is at the bottom of the business and
Senator AVhite is its tool while Sena
tor Hoar is its beneficiary. Senator
White announces that he is so poor
that he is considering the matter of
making no attempt to be re-elected to
the Senate. Should his opposition to
Hawaii continue it will be useless for
him to make further attempt to stay
in the Senate whether he will or no.
The people of the Pacific Coast want
to see the annexation of the Hawaiian
islands: there is nothing to lose by
their annexation and everything to
ain for the Coast and the country at
large; those of our Representatives
;ind Senators in Congress who oppose
the measure will be held to a strict
accountability.
More Uiau a thousand men have left
Dawson City according to latest ad
vices, to escape starvation aud flour is
worth iflO'J per sack and candles $1.50
each. There is serious danger of a
great disaster there should the storms
of winter be so severe as to prevent
escape to the coast.
And yet there are other pebbles on
the matrimonial beach. The malicious
whisper is going about that a certain
well preserved disponsator of justice
is slyly making arrangements to come
down off his perch of lonesomness.
Central Arizona is enjoying typical
winter weather, ie.. a perfectly clear
clear sky, a bracing air from sun
down to sunup and a genial sunshine
during the day that -should help create
red corpuscles in the most impover
ished blood.
Lieutenant Baldwin returned from
his trip of inspection in the southern
portion of the Territory on Sunday
morning. He reports the companies
of militia at Yuma, Tucson and Xo
gales in fine shape taking much inter

Lieutenant is greatly pleased witu
what he finds in the militarv affairs of
Arizona.
The house of Gould-Casterlaiue
seems to have already arrived at a
conclusion to quit business. Caster-
lain has set the pace too hot for Gould.
The ambition among American women
to marry a title but who get profliga
cy, has received another shock.
The people of Pinal county have the
ngnr. Kind ot sturr in them to make a
success of irrigation. Thev will send
i representative to AA'ashington for
flie purpose ofi nducing the Govern
ment to take up the matter of water
storage at the Butte reservoir site on
the Gila. Those people will have water
in abundance for the Gila valley in
due time.
rirst street is now in a fair wav to
be improved before the next rain storm
sets it swimming. The sidewalks le
tween AA'ashington and Adams and
AA'ashington and Jefferson will be com
pleted and the street drains so improv
ed as to lessen the necessity for bus
iness men along the street to learn
to swim.
Nothing of more general benefit to
the morals of the country has been
done lately than the official announce
ment of the post office department that
the mails would hereafter be closed
to newspapersthat piiutmissing letter
word contests, or any other kind of
or lottery schemes. Some of the most
daring swindling of the agft has been
conducted by tin's class of advertiser
all of which violated the spirit, if not
the letter ofthe auti-lotterv law.
Occasionally Maricopa county se
cures a Grand Jury that is willing to
do its sworn duty, a Grand Jury that
has left its pot of white wash at home.
It is a good bit easier for the citizens
of the county to pay for a week or a
month of Grand Jury fees than to pay
for such embezzlements as they have
been called on in the past to put up
for, if the Grand Jury does its duty
every time there will be no embezzlements.

Those thirteen foreign nations whose

have not yet made good their bluff

the contrary, their purchases from us

Murphy saved the post for the time
ind in the Cleveland administration
other influences were necessary to re
tain that post from destruction: again
if is reported an order has gone forth
for its abandonment and Gov. McCord
is endeavoring to save it. The press
of all northern Arizona andof Fhocnix
has repeatedly discussed this matter
and has repeatedly shown the neces
sity of the retention of this post. Lo
cated as it is the forces established
there are available either iu eases of
i -ouble with the Indians ou the White
I Mountain reservation, the Navajo res
ervation or among the Indians in the
northwestern portion of Arizona.
Thus it is the only necessary jo:t in
the north and is most eligibly lo
cated where its troops are available at
the shortest possible notice in all
northern Arizona and by our present
railroad connections the Whipple
forces could be sot down at Xogales
on the .Mexican border or at an;.' point
along the Southern Pacific road before
troops from l-'t. Grant, located in
Southern Arizona could reach those
points. The people of Northern aud

Three P's, patriotism, peace and
prosperity form the keynote of Pres
ident McKiuley's annual message to
Congress. His treatment of the an
nexation of Hawaii, the Cuban aud
other foreign questions, including that i
of commercial reciprocity, is patriotic j
to the core, without the slightest trace !
of jingoism, and his treatment of the !
financial ami other' domestic qucs- j
tions is that of a man w ho only de-
sires that which will continue and in- j
crease the prosperity the country is
now beginning to enjoy. j
President McKinley is still hopeful
of definite and valuable results from
the efforts in behalf of international
bimetallism which were inaugurated
by the Republican party immediately
following his election. In his message
he discusses briefly the work of the
work of the commission sent abroad
for that purpose, expresses gratifica
tion lhat our great sister Republic of
France was willing to join with this
country in an attempt to bring about
agreement on this subject, and closes
his discussion of thequestionbysaying
that he has still reason to hope that the
labors ot this commission may re
sult in an international agreement
which will bring about recognition of
both gold and silver money upon such
terms and with such safeguards as
will secure the use of both metals
upon a basis which will work no in
justice to any class of our citizens.
