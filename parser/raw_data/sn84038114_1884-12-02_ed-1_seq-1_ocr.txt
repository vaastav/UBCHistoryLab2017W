PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.

P1CTAE DOCUMENT—IMFOB
TAHT EEOIUE4TION
■ ».COMMENDED.
President Arthur's fourth and final
annual message was delivered to Con
gress on Monday. Like the whole course
of bis administration, it Is marked by
manly good souse. It opens with refer
ence to tbe receut election and the loy
alty to law of American citizenship eo
marked at the close of a heated contest
decided by so small a majority of tbe
popular vote In the deciding State. He
renews the suggestions for a revision of
the legislation on the »object as a mat
ter of "gravest importance." Every
one who understands the perils of tbe
existing system will second his sugges
tion. Our relations with all foreign
S overnments are in a serene condition.
ueb of them as afford oocasftons for
any remark are disposed of in alpha
betical older.
With Belgium we have a new con
vention, which places the oltlsens of
the two countries on a more nearly
equal foe"* g with regard to personal
and property r>bta ; and there Is also
a new trademark treaty. It is Inti
mated as to reitK u ( hii.t se coining to
this country that an act of Congresaof
tbe last scssiou may bean Infringement
of the Chinese treaty. The recent pur
chase by American citizens of a large
fleet of Chinese trading vessels is made
tbe occasion for a suggestion that a uni
form role for the legistiatlon of such
ves els might be adopt d
Reference U then made to tbe Congo
Conference now sitting at Berlin, and
to our Coversinent's
The advantage of
premises occupied by our legations
abroad, Is brought to tbe attention of
Cong renn apropos to tbe handsome
behavior of Corea, Morocco, Japan,
Slam and other countries in offering us
lands and hoiiat*. Our intercourse
with Egypt has been embarrassed by
the failure of Congress to make a certain
appropriation, and the restoration of
the Consulate General at Cairo Is re
commended.
When France comes to lie considered
theie is a neut little suggestion lor help
to the Bartholdi statue }K«lcsta!—that's
all of our French rclauoi s Negotia
lionaare to be opened with tbe Ger
mau Empire for a single extradition
treaty to r*place the separate treaties
with the several German Slates. Great
Britain—everything being in fine cou
rt ition—is riisjMiHed of in three lines.
The Hawaiian Reciprocity Treaty in
judgment of the 1'resident should be
renewed for seven tears. [To this there
is strong objection. J The Hay tien révo
lu 'ion is over.
Italy and several other foreign Gov
ernments are «xercisid about our tariff
duties on foreign works of art. Japan
gets encouraging words concerning the
revision ot treaties desired by that
country. The Mexican Commercial
Treaty awaits the necessary legislation
by our Congress , also the re-survey of
tie Mexican boundary. With Nicara
gua a liberal and just treaty has l>een
concluded, authorizing Deconstruct!* n
by the Uuited States of a canal, rail
way and telegraph aerr ss the isthmus.
Our Intercourse with Bussia is so en
tirely satisfactory that a few lines dia
S oe.es of the subject, and tbe same with
lam.
Spain, Cuba and Porto Bioo call for
more extended remarks with regard to
tbe efforts of our Government to pre
vent filibustering from our shores
against Cuba ; and in respect of the
more carefully prepared Commercial
Convention, recently negotiated with
Spain, which is soon to be laid before
the Senate. The negotiation to this Con
vention has postponed tbe considera
tion of certaiu claims of American ciU
/.»■us which will now be urged. A Com
mercial Bee!procity Convention hss
been negotiated with San Domingo.
Some ugliness on tbe part of Tur
key on tariff subjects remain unad
justed ; and the V enezuelan claims
dispute, it is expected, will soon be
settled.
Tbe message then refers to the Cen
tral and South American Commission,
the International Meridan Commission,
tbe subjectof International Exhibitions
and Commission», and international
marine for preventing collisions
at sea—with all of wich tbe public
are familiar. Tbe matter of Internation
al copyright is called to the attention
of Congress ; also, the enlargement
of the, scope of our neutrality
laws ho an to prevent the shipment
of explosiven that may bo used for mali
cious or bostile purposes ; and likewise
the desirability for a revision of
our naturalization laws, ho as to Include
a central registry bureau for all natu
ralization papers issued. A project
for the organization of tbo diplomatic
and consular service ih rec ..mmenned,
and also tor re-castiug of the scheme
of extra teritorial jurisdiction
in certain foreipn countries.
In Treasury matters the message is
obliged to repeat some facts already
known. The total revenue from ordi
nary sources for the year ended June
30, 1884, was $548,510,870 ; the total
expenditure for ordinary purposes was
$290,016,474. There was a net decrease
of expenditure for tbe year of $21,000,
000, while tbe falling off' in the revenue
was $54 000,000. For the present year,
to 30th qf June next, the estimated
reveuue is placed at $230 000.000, and
the estimated expenditures at $290,620,
201, leaving an estimated, surplus of
$39,060,000. For other statistics rela
ting to imports, exports and manufac
tures, we refer to tbe d< curoent itself.
Tbe President recommends the ira
mediate suspension of the coinage of
standard silver dollars, referring to the
conclusive fact that, of the $185,000,006
of them coined, only $40,000,000, or only
22 per cent, of them, can be kept in
circulation ; and also referring to the
expressed conviction of the Secretary of
the Treasury that, unless tbe coiuago is
stopped, silver will become our sole
metalic standard. The President
further seconds the suggestion that the
one and two dollar notes be withdrawn
from oirculation, but this, we imagine,
will not be so heartily acquiesoed In by
tbe public. As to tbe Trade Dollars,
it is recommended that they be called
in at a slight advance over their bullion
value. As one reason for fixing that
unfair price on tbe Trade Dollar, the
President has been led into the error of
stating that they " never had a legal
tender quality."
The message renews his recommen
dation for the altolition of all Internal
Bevenue taxes,except those on distilled
ipiCiLs ; and tie oalls attention to the
MMllMrlo recommendation of the Stcre
pmfêt the Treasury, in favor of liberal
SpUMDte for mail transportation,as an

oapitalin American »tea tust l|m and

by the Senate at the last session to per
mit the Issue of notes to the face value
of the bonds Is commended to the favor
of the House.
The portions of the message
ing the War Department relate to
tine matters, except those connected
with the sea coast and harbor defenses,
and the related manufacture of heavy
modern cannon. The President renews
his recommendation to Congress to
authorise the Government to construct
its own ordnanoehcre at home, for such
armaments as are necessary tor the
national safety and honor.

1 here ere but three other subjects ia the
message that are not already rally I efore the
Ç ubile, or that are n t of a routine nature.
'best are thcreoominendatton of a pension
In recognition of the services of Genera]
Grant : that which emphasises the good re
sults of the CJlvll Service act ; and that which
relates to the extension of our cotnroeree
abroad and theeoonomlc policy to he pursu
ed at home An the tariff and other kindred
questions. It Is not easy to make this last
mentioned r«>rtlon or the message elear In a
brief summary, and we therefore recommend
every one to reed at least that pert of the
document The complex problem Involved
Is admirably stated.
For the enl«rgement of o-r commerce It
suggests reciprocal commercial treaties with
our sister ü met lean States, to which we
should mainly look for commercial extension;
the establishment ot our consular system on
a salaried footing so as to do away with the
burden of fees on reciprocal commerce ; tfe
enactment of measures to favor an âmerl -an
•team merchant marine ; and the estât* isb
inent of a uniform monetary basis for ell
Amerloan countries. It seems to the Presl
dent that such measures will not only turn
to good account the existing protection and
free trade conflict, bnt "that the i «venue
may be reduced so as to no longer overtax
the people ; that protective duties may be
retained without becoming burdensome; th .t
•hipping Interests may be judiciously
encouraged .the currency fixed on firm basis,
and above all such au unity of Interest este
bllshed among the States of the American
system as will be of great and
advantage to us all *'
The message closes with the following
graceful and grateful passage *• As the
fine draws nigh when 1 am to »«tire from
the public service, 1 cannot refrain from ex
pressing to the members of the National
legislature, with whom 1 have heen brought
into personal and official Intercourse, my
slacere appreciation of their unfailing
tesy, and of their hanannlons so-operatbrn
with the Executive In so many measures
calculated to promote the best interests
ot the nation. Aud to my fellow oltizuns
generally 1 acknowledge a deep sense of
obligation for the support which they have
accorded tne In my administration of
tre Executive Department of this Govern
ment.
Work ob Che Big .Bridge Checked
The work on the big B. & P. bridge
over the Brandy wine baa been tempora
rily checked by the P..W.& B.Railroad
Company objecting to any wood work
trusses being placed upon their pro
perty on (he east side of the Brandy
wine. The latter has sixty feet right
of way np the Brandywine and the B.
& P. bad eiecieti some of their trusses
on this property, bat notin such a man
ner as to obstruct the passage of trains.
Objections, however, being made to
this there was nothing left tor the B. &
P. Company to do than to tear down
tkalpartof the work standing on the
property of the P., W. & B. Kail road
Company.
The trusses were taken down on 8nuday
aud the B. & P. Company will be put
to the trouble of framing an arch over
the other road, which can be done but
not without the cousnmption of a little
more time and expense.
Muddy Water.
The water supplied to the inhabitants
of this city for the past week has been a
compound of mud and tilth, totally un
fit for use. No one seems to know
what the trouble is. but it is certain
that if it is possible to do so something
should be doue to porify it before it is
pased into the mains to be distributed
to families. Such a compound cannot
but prove prejudicial to health, and as
the water is bad enongh at the best,
some action should be taken without
delay to make it as pure as possible.

The Power efBsvey.
Morris & Bock's new inelo drawn,
" The Power of Money," was presented
at the Opera House last evening, I efore
a medium sized audience. The scenery,
which has been painted expressly for
this play, is realistic and grand, and
the train passing around the horse shoe
bend is one of the finest pieces of stage
mechanism ever shown in this city.
The double character of BtuartForsytbe
and «lohn Forsythe, the twin brothers,
is well portrayed by Frederick Bock,
and the changes lie makes in scene 4,
act 1st, and scene 3 in the 5th act, are
done so quick and neatly that the
audience can scarcely realise that the
two characters are personated by the
same person.
Frauk Davis as PeterLucuia Jolland,
and Miss Fanny Davis as Artemesla
Clinton Jolland, with tbeir songs and
specialties ars excellent, and were
loudly applauded, while Mr. Davis'
imitation of a stuttering woman in
search of a parrot, convulsed the audi
ence with laughter, and brought down
the Louse. All the other characters
were well sustained, and the company
is fully ah strong aa the generality
visiting this city.
The play Itself is filled with thrilling
situations, and the plot is well drawn.
The drama and the company are worthy
of the patronage of the theatre going
public,and the house should be crowded
at the last performance this evening.

goods were sold, bis brother bought
gcods for him to the amount of $570 ;
he got his brother to buy them because

täte belonging to him, and for which
Mar iu Walker was his guardian, was
some ten or twelve thousand dollar»*
but he could not r« member how muclt
was due him al the time of settlement.
This closed the evid- nee for Mr Scow
drick, and Mr. Biggs called J. F Elia

fied th a i he had loaned Mr. Walk«r

ged counsel, whea he asked Mr t Hot.
fecker about it,aud he asserted that the
mortgage was paid in full.
In looking over tbe a%eets of Mai tin

Mr. 8cowdrick in reference to the mort
gage, a 1 he was under the impresion
