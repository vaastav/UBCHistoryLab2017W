Hood's Defeat.
Since the la?t issue of the Sentinel,
we have bad glorious news from the
Union armies all along the line, but the
most important is the victory of General
Thomas, at Nashville. .
It will hi. remembered th t when
Geniral Sherman couinienced his cam
paign last summer for the capture of
Atlanta, General Johnston was ia com
mand of the rebel army, Ilia policy was
the retreating one, with which the Con
federates became dissatisfied". -They
demanded a chauge in the leadership of
their army. Accordingly Johnston was
removed, and Hood was put in Lis place
But the desperate figruing of the rebels,
o ider their new ccm:nander, availed them
nothing, and Atlanta fell. TLen there
was gloom throughout rc-beldom, and
Jtff. Darls started out on a tour of
speech-making to rjl'y the traitors. He
aonouneed to them tliat ho had matured
plan for a new campaign. He pro
posed to put Hood upon Sherman's com
munications, which, it was supposed by
the arch-leader, would compel the latter
to rarest Northward. Not so. General
Shermau went on in the execution of the
great march to the Atlantic. II iod fol
lowed the Union forces uuder General
Thomas up to the very gates of Nashville.
The rebels were jubilant. They expected
Nashville ti c mie into rebel possession,
together with the states of Tennessee and
Kentucky.
But in this, ns in many other instances,
Confederate hopes were b!u9ted. On the
2 Gth ins'ant, G nn.1 Thomas moved out
of'-Jfachtille JiD'l attacked the rebels.
They were OV? r hi'mned utterly routed.
TLey were driven eight aiihg on the
first day of the Gght, aud up to this date,
21st the Uuit forces are still in pur
suit. Hood's loss in men is stated to be
about 12,000; also, about sixty pieces of
artillery. It is the most disastrous de
feat the rebels Lave suffered during the
war. According to present indication

murderous war
Five years ago.
";fore tha public mind became hardened
by the recitals of the carnage of war, it
was an event sufucieut to shock the nerves
of whole neighborhoods of people to
find a man lifeless ia a gutter by the road
tide, dead from internal burning, from
the fires which flash out in lurid glares
from the whisky-cup. Such an event
was written about ia the newspapers, was
preached tbout ia the pulpit, was talked
about ia the school-room and around th
neartn-stono ot notce. ho tne victim
was, Low many ofphans he left in the
cold world, what w,.maa he left with
widow's broken-heart, what high hopes
went down with him what love was
wrecked in his awful death, where
Le bought his last liquor, who saw
him list, who hearl Lis terrible death
groans, who found the dead b dy
all these were talked of in the neighbor
hood with feelings of horror. Dow dif
ferent now ! We hear to-day of dead
bodies by regiments ; of th msnls of
groans ascending from our battle-fields
of thousands of widows and orphans, oil
made iu the flash of a few batteries in
a fw minutes of tim?. We thiak but
little, care but little about the poor devil
who, drunk with liquor topples over into
the long death-slcepl We roll his bdy
into a druukar J's grave, and over it drop
no tear, erect no stoae. "Let them drink
let them die,'' gay we. Our thoughts.
oar hpes, our fears, all, all are centered
in the battle-field, and the issues it de
cides. The rum-seller's business proa
pers ; its followers grow bold, and look
you in the face with a countenance ot no
shame. His business is good ; he is
making money; what cares he for aught
else? What matters it to him if a few
orpnans ana wiaows ar3 maae l a lew
bodies buried in whisky-graves? a few
souls sent whirling to an eternity of dis
mal darkness ? hat matters it to him?
His Lusinoss is good; ten-cent drinks sell
rapidly: bis coffers are filling up. In
fact he entertains the idea that bis busi
ness is qu;te respectable. Jlea of good
families drink at his bar; preachers do
not denounce him, or his business, as of
o'd they were wont to do ; newspapers
fill their columns with the dispatches of
blood-red war they do cot speak out
against the rum-seller'a business. The
requirements of morality loosen, and grog
shops prosper in a perfect harvest of
drunkards.
Hjw lorg shall this stata of things
continue?
Our Jamestown correspondence, ia
this paper, tells of another victim of the
bowl. G roggerics prosper in Jamestown;
so they do in Xeuia, so they do through
out the county; so they do throughout the
State ; so they do throughout the nation,
in the army and out of it.
Friends of your race ! you who desire
to see virtue and Lappiness promoted over
sin and woe, be not blinded entirely to
the devas'ations of the enemy at home.
Fight rebellion and slavery still, with a
will, but forget not to deliver stunning
blows to the advoca'es ' of the home
destroyer, Intemperance. Keep alive
the hate you cherish for the liquor bar ;
frown still upon the rum-seller, and use
moral suasion earnestly ever to lessen
the profits of his calling.
Intemperance stalks through the land
with a bold front and a destroying band.
His majiy victims warn to vigilance.
You, who never imbibed, beware of
the awful first drlnh. One step, and
you will take another, aud then another,
and each succeeding one you take will
make your return the harder.
You, who drink now, stop before it is
"everlastingly too late."
You, who have influence over an
erring brother, exert y.iurself to save.
You, mother, wife or daughter, use the
mighty influence you have to bring the
wayward from the "errors of their ways"
to shield the guiltless eie they take an
awful step.
Cheering.
It is indeed cheering to pass along the
street, and notice the animated faces cf
those who have just received news like that
which came to us in the beginning of the
present week, from Thomas and his gal
lant littlearmy. Becoming, by long usage,
familiar with rciorts of gnat events that
crowd fast one upon another, in these
historysmaking times, cur good people are
not so much given to n isy demonstration,
as in the first years of the war; but the
quiet j"y aud heattfilt satisfaction can be
plainly read in the cheery look on all sides.
A few more effective .Llows, and we can
begin to see the dawning of the glorious
peace, so eagerly longed for a peace hon
orably won not patched up by compro
mise, but solid, lasting aud permanent, in
which each one shall know and recognize
his pr per place when ba l, bold and dis
contented men shall have learned the les
son thus far canst thou go at.d no farther.
An occasional gloomy oountcuance will bo
seen, the owaer of which you may be sure,
finds no pleasure in news of Federal suc
cesses, but, thank Heaven, in this commu
nity ot least, such faces aie "few and far
between." Recognizing the folley of cry
ing "peace, peace," when thero is no pi ace,
with j .y can we hail thr-nowj of victories
which lighten the way of its coining
dear bought but Lonorable.

The New Call.
Our readers all heard, several days age?,
of the new call issued by the Fresident for
three hundred thousand men. If these
tuca ere raised by the 15th day of Febru
ary, a'l right ; if they ai e ubt, a draft wili
be executed. In the election of Abraham
Lincoln to a second term, the peop'e voted j
for war till the rebellion is put down, and
new they must not wi'hhold the means,
either of money or.unn. The ranks at
the front must be kept full.
We hipe to sec the people of our coun
ty go to work to fill our quota. The men
can be obtained in one month if the money
can be collected to pay them. Let us of
fer reasonable bounties, and make up the
sum necessary to clear us of the draft.
We can do so if we go to work in earnest.

Books for Youth.
The boys and girls of the present time
have a wide advantage over those of past
generations, in their facilities for procur
ing information and amusements through
the medium of the many nublications
so peculiarly well adapted to their wants
and comprehension. The forthcoming
holidays will witness aa unusual number
of works. of this kind, put forth, written
especially for the instruction of the young
folks, and full of information, that to ar
rive at, we who were boys before them, had
to delve through.hard uninteresting volumes
the very bok of wLich was discouraging.
There were a few authors, in the days of
our boyhood, who made it their especial
business to write for the children, at the
head of which small list stood Peter Par
ley dear old Peter Tarley. How well do
we remember the joy with wLich we came
into possession of two worn volumes cf his
Magaz:ne, dog-eared and worn in the for
mer ownership of an elder brother, but
more splcndii to our young eyes than all
"blue and gold" editions of modern days.
Long were they cherished and their home
ly wood cuts pored over, and often the in
teresting pages read, until worn out by
long use, there was naught left but the
covers.
But boys of the present time G nd
treasures of that kind much more p'enti
ful, and they find equal pleasure in the
possession of them, they must be Lappy
fellows indeed. We do not allude to the
heavy dose of biographical works recently
put forth, entitled 'The Pioneer Boy,' 'The
Bobbin Boy,' 'Ferry Boy 'Drummer
Boy' etc., etc., as though every man who
suddenly shows to the world that he has
the elements of greatness about him,
should, in imitation of the 'Mill Boy of
the Slashers, be termed a boy of some
particular propensity. This style of book
was most ably bit off by a writer in the
Atlantic some mouths ago. But we speak
of the many publications which combine
amusement and instruction, and to works
like 'A Boy's History of England,' 'History
of the Rebellion, ic, which are" gotten up
in such attractive style, and which prove
of iuterest t o many a grown up reader.
Our Bookstores will have on hand the usual
full supplies, and surely no more appro
priato or welcome presents for the young
folks, during the coming holidays, could
be selected, than books of the kind spoken
of above.
The Local News of Jamestown.
Ma. Editor : If you would listen to
our opinion of what new3 a county paper
should convey to its readers, you would
learn that when we read the county pa
per it is for the purpose of learning the
neics of the county. We love to read letters
from our friends at Cedanille, Yellow
Springs, Bellbrook, Fairfield and from all
parts of the county, bec-iure we get news
in this manner which we will never hear
through any other medium, unless it
should be something that startles a whole
neighborhood ; then we may get a hint,
or most likely r.n exaggerated account of
what has taken place, through the medium
of tradition. Oh ! what a dependence
for news I You know in this day and
generation we hear the " reliable Gen
tleman"- state, that he heard a man say,
that he saw a gentleman, and heard him
say, tuat tue haruer, who snaves sir.
Lincoln, actually told him that he, Mr. L.
was certainly going to remove Mr. Seward
aud re commend Tom Thumb as his suc
cessor, i his is a sample oi tne news wiiica
we get from tradition. Hence the im
portance of good local correspondents in
in all parts of tho county, who will. take,
pains to gather the fact, and enlighten the
people with truth, if nothiug else. Have
patience.- We have told you what wo
think ought to be in a coun y piper, and
we want to give you our opinion' of what
we think is not necessary to be in it, and
we dou't want you- to thick that We are
dictating your business, either. You are
the Editor. We the readers, r.nd we
know, or think we do, what we want with
county paper. There are about ono hun
dred dailies taken at this place, and we
suppose as inuny or more at the othei towns
in the county, so that three-fourths of
the people pet the general news daily.
You were right in sajing that there is no !
use of publishing the President's message 1
and similar articles, which perhaps were
read a week in alvanca of 3'our issue.
The local news is what we want, and so
here goes for Jamestown.
Our Lyceum contiuue-s to draw a large
audience.' We occupy the School Room,
where you made your speech in behalf
of Mr. Lincoln. May you never speak in a
worse cause 1 We discuss all kinds .of
juestions, Moral, religious and political.
The question discussed Inst Friday
evening was: "JiesoheJ, that the words
but no attainder of treason shall work
corruption of blood or furfuture except i
during the life of the p?rsoa attainted," i
should be stricken out of the 2d clause
of III section in article III of the
constitution. The discussion was aoinna-
tcd; there being eight debaters, four on
each sido. Tho question for next Friday
evenmg is : 'Rasoivcd, that all the colored
people in the U. S. should bo eolouized."
In connection with our Lyceum we
have a Literary paper, iu which there are
articles which would be a credit to many
of our Literary Journals. The members

in the columns of the Sentinel, some good
questions? By so doing, you will organize
a debating society at hast in ever store or

Another victim of intemperance in
the jerscn of Martin Connofurd, an Irish
man, who during the past week patronized
the whiskey shops liberally. Being quite
arunK on rnaay ana r-aturaay, he was
found on Sunday mcrning at the east side
of town in a most wretched condition
and life almost extinct. He was brought
into town and died just as his. friends'
arrived with him at the American House.
Thus ends the existence of another victim
of intemperance. Martin was an . honest

A Letter from Nashville.
NASHVILLE, TENN., DEC. 17th., 1864.
Editob Sentinel:-
I do not write to give an account of the two
davs battle in this vicinity, for Lba.t will be
fully described by ablei correspondents.
That the false hopes of traitors North and
South that Hood's raid might be damaging to
the Union forces, Lave been defeated is a
matter of rejoicing to every lover of his coun
try-
Many half-hearted, were beginning to des
pond. Some saw nothing but disgrace in the
retreat of Gen. Thomasl-army to Nashville,
and some even feared, contrary to reason, that
Nashville would be captured by the dashing
Hood, and it is rumored that one citizen
Nashville actually blew the hot water out of
his head with a pistol, fearing he might be
captured by the rebels.
Eut no one doubts now that flood was very
imprudent in marching into the trap set for
him by his superior, Thomas. -
We had the privilege of seeing what I have
often wished the opportunity of seeing, that
is, a fight in the neighborhood of some hill
where I could see the engagement.
From one of the hills south of Nashville
the lines of men, both rebel and Union, could
be distinctly seen, and near enough to be
heard as they charged with enthusiastic cour
age, making their voices heard amid the crash
of musketry and the deeper-toned music of
artillery. Such a scene ia more interesting
tjian aTiejtrical performance, and those who
wish to enjoy such entertainments would do
well to join the army.
The weather this morning is cloudy, the
roads muddy and the atmosphere foetry, but
the glorious victory of the past two days
make every one cheerful.
Hood's army is several miles away and ours
in close pursuit.
Every day will find his army in a worse con
dition than the previous one, and we hope his
fate will be worse than that of his miserable
colleague further west General (?) Price.
