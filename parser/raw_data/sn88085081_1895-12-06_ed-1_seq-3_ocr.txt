The President’s message, the docu
ments which everybody talKs about,
but few have the patience to read,

financial and otherwise’ which have
brought upon the people hardship and
contempt.
Photographer Baker seems to have
struck a vein of bad luck of late. East
week he made a trip to the Chehalis
Indian reservation near Oakville. Af
ter a hard day,s ride in the rain he
reached the reservation, put up his
horse in the big barn and was drying
himself in one of the houses, when the
barn was discovered to be on fire. In
a short time it was totally destroyed
with several hundred tons of hay, oats,
barley and roots; besides all the horses
and cattle except one cayuse and one
cow. Baker’s horse being among the
last, as well as a fine government team
and hack. Mr. Baker feels his loss
considerably, more for his attachment
for the animal than for its value. The
Chehalis reservation has just become
selfsupporting and this fire will put it
back considerably.
Olympia merchants have given the
steamer Seaside a bonus to make three
trips each week to all North Bay towns
and Hartstein Island, and bring those
residents to Olympia free of charge.
The object is to get them to do their
trading there. Much of this trade
now goes to Tacoma but still a consid
erable amount comes to Shelton, and if
our merchants will get up some
scheme to make trading more conven
ient it is likely that Shelton can secure
the bulk of this trade within the coun
ty. We have several big general mer
chandise stores where goods are sold
as cheap as they are anywhere and in
drugs, dry goods, clothing, holiday
goods or any other line of trade, there
are splendid big stocks from which to
buy at very low prices. The county
trade should be retained where it will
benefit us all. We suggest that a
floating dock be built at the point and
some inducements offered in the way
of free or cheap transportation from
the points mentioned. A perusal of
the Journal’s advertising will con
vince that Shelton is amply able to
supply the county people at very low
prices.
See Asmus’ big announcement. He
intends closing out his stock of gener
al merchandise and also selling his
property interests in Shelton. If j'ou
want anything prices will be no ob
ject.
The Mason County Logging Co.,
has about finished logging at camp 14
and has transferred one horse team
and part of the men to camp 3, in the
“cut-off.” The camp in charge of
James Mcßeavy, has still plenty of
timber in sight. The Company is now
laying out a switch and locating new
camps in timber about a mile south of
Laue Newatzel, which will be opened
up in time for spring worK. The spur
will leave the main line just east of
the LaKe, and will be constructed with
the iron now on the switch to camp 14.
The L. M. Co find themselves over
stocked and are offering some lines of
goods at cost for a few days in order
to have them reduced before invoicing.
O. C. Hanson has gone back to clerk
ing again, and is handling the yard
stick in the big store.
The Mottman Mercantile Company,

Female Suffrage.
The Olympian does not profess to
know the sentiment of the majority o - f
the women of this state on the ques
tion of woman’s suffrage. If, however,
their sentiment is to be judged by that
which was evidenced at the recent
election iu Massachusetts, by the
women of that state, the greater num
ber of the women themselves do not
want the privileges which suffrage
brings. At the election there, which
was to determine as to the extension
of womans suffrage iu municipal mat
ters, but one female in ten availed her
self of the privilege to vote on the
proposition. The indifference of the
women is iu itself an argument
against the extension of suffrage to
them, for if they are not enough in
terested to say whether or not they
want to vote, upon what proposition
would it be possible to get an accurate
expression of opinion from them?
However, it may be possible for the
women of this state differ in the mat
ter from their sisters in New England.

An odd exercise was the reading of
