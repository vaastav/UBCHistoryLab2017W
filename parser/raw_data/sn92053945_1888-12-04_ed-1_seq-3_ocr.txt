For fully an hour b-fore Speaker t'-ar-
lisle, at 1 o'clock, utruck his desk with a
brand new g?iVtd and called the hou to
order, a scene was presented on tha fl.ior
which was highly noisy and mirthful. Tne
desks of the members were nearly all occu
pied, and each man tnltced to the other in a
loud tone of voice, explaining election inci
dents and accidents., fnere was much hand'
shaking. W hen Randall, looking fairly
well, entered end took his seat, a few min

and concluded at Z-.V p. m. Nearly every
member was present, tbe only prominent
absentee being Band all, who, alter answer
ing to the roll-call, left tbe capitot. The
strictest attention at the beginning of the
reading was given by members on both sides
of the chamber. The first subject to cause
applanse was at the conclusion of the para
graph discussing the tan IT. f be Uemocrats,
led by iSpringer aud others, broke out
into a round of bandclapping. It was
of short duration, however, and did
not cause the clerk to halt in his reading.
Where the mes-age touched o i tbe dismissal
of Minister R-tckville, and said tt was neces
sary to the dignity of this government tfl
have a "new tentorial channel or communi
cation with Great Britain, the Republicans
broke ont in derisive laughter, which was re
newed when the cleak read the passage say
ing that the British minister's ofranse took
place at the crisis of a presidential election.
and again when he read the reference to
Minister saokville as "the person. interest
in tbe mesnage fl-tgged when the reading of
recommendations of tbe various depart
ments was reached and members all over the
bouse kept up a constant bun of conversa
tion, visited one another, and smoked and
talked in groups behind the screen. As
soon as the rending of tha message was con
cluded the bouse adjourned.
COMMENTS OF THE STATESMEN.
Sowden, (Pa.) Dam. The message is u
right except the tariff portion. The farmers
of this country in the last election put a
veto on the president's idea i ney www
that what betters the wage-workers' condi
tion enhances the price of their products,
and tbey voted accordingly.
Breckinridge (Ky) The president keeps
in view the fact tbat it is a fight between
monopoly and labor, and he is ou the side of
labor.
McMillin (Tenn.), Dam. The president
maintains tbe advanced position he assumed
on the tariff, and he in right.
Weaver (la.) The president's position on
tbe tariff is just tbe right thing, but 1 am
sorry hf saw At to recommend a suspension
of silver coinage.
Crisp of tieorgia I think the president
gives a strong and correct presentation of
the Democratic view of the tariff question.
Blount of Georgia It ts the ablest pape
bo has ever prodced.
Thomas of Illinois The style is decidedly
sophomoric. No distinction is made between
external nnd internal taxes Tbey are spoken
of a a common burden. Taking the mi
sage as a woole, one is reminded of that
IwatifV state of philosophy and purity in
which a disappointed office-seeker finds bim-
seif when he contemplates tbe follies and
frailties of mankind. It is really a pitiful
wail.
Dunham of Illinois It is a rehash of the
tariff nie-sige that killed him. We look
upon it as the vaporing of a disappoiuted
man.
It ia amusing to tee people with their
face drawn as if they had swallowed a
feather and it was tickling their lungs
and they would be happy if they eouid
only aneexe. Now, there ie no need of

tive Herbert, of Alabama, said Sunday
night that he had not seen the interviews
with Col. Dates, in which be bad advocated
the adoption of a constitutional amendment,
disfranchising tha negroes. "But," said he.
1 do not cbi"ct to saying that I believe socn
an amendment unwise and impracticable. I
fully realize the seriousness of the negro
question in Alabama and other states of tbe
south. 1 know that negro rule means ruin
to any uttte Kut I would be far from pro
posing disfranchisement If a proposition
of that hind were ever made it should be
made by the Republicans themselves, and
tbat, of iourse, will never happen.

A Few Opinions Hastily Gathered by the
News Collectors.
Washington City, Dec. 4. At the con
clusion of the reading of the president's
message the representative of the United
ire attempted to obtain from prominent
congressmeo their views upon the communi
cation. Many 83nators and representatives
deolined to express themselves, giving as
reasons that they bad beard but portions
of tt read. As a rule the Democrats heartily
endorsed it, while the Republicans could not
Sid anything good to say in its behalf. A
few of tbe expressions obtained are given
below:
Hoar About all I can say is hat it em
bodies tbe utterances of a disoppointed poli
tician.
Sherman The latter part of the message
consists of a review of the work of tbe
different branches of tbe government. There
is nothing striking about it Toe first part I
did not bear.
Cullom Of necessity be dies game on his
tariff views, and in his reference to internal
affairs runs into a great scold.
Frye Tbe onlv part of the comunication
which interested me was that referring to
the fisheries question. I am now trying to
solve the problem therein, namely: Tbe
president states that there has been nothing
of moment occurring on that subject sines
March last. W hy then does he so severely
criticise us for not passing retaliatory legis-
latiouf
Mandersnn I was not particularly struck
with what I beard of tbe message. I can
say, however, that if Mr. Cleveland will
visit the northwest after be has more leisure.
be will find tbat our fanner's do not indorse
his utterances on the tariff question.
Cockrell I cannot say much abont tbe
message until I shall have read it over.
Generally speaking, it impressed ma very fa
vorably.
Hansom I think It was like all of Mr.
Cleveland's public oomraunications have
bean, a very able and concisely framed in
strument.
Teller I think tbat the first part of the
message is full of spleen. There was no U
ver lie ng to tbe cloud that overhung Mr.
Cleveland when he wrote it. I do not be
lieve the country is in so deplorable a condi
tion as he would have as believe. As to tbe
to tbe administration of the different de
partments, I want to say In answer to tbe
president that tbe post office department
was never in a worse condition tbaaitism
to-dar.
