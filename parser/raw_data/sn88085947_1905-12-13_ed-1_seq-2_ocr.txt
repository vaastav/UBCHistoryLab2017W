"The first thing to do is to deal with the great cor
porations engaged in the business of interstate transporta
tion."
In President "Roosevelt's entire forceful message no
other paragraph stands out like this one.
In tlie public mind no other imposition meets such
enthusiastic response.
In his demand for federal regulation of railway rates
tlie president faces congress with the hacking of a tremen
dous force of popular approval.
Tlie people are with the president,
ls congress with the railroads?
If so, there will be a contest such as this country, or
any other, has seldom seen.
There is no use in hunting elephants with a popgun.
And we have learned at last that there is no wisdom in
seeking to cheek gigantic corporations with threads of
legal theory.
The United States constitution secures to congress the
power to regulate commerce between the states. It is
time the constitution be consulted and the railawy mag
nates compelled to cease usurping that power.
For a half century and more the railways, through
arbitrary and unjust discriminations in rates, have been
building up monopolistic trusts, killing industries that
might have grown great, and retarding the development of
va.st sections, rich in natural resources, but marooned from
the industrial world by unfair rates.
The country is weary of its commerce being controlled
by railway corporations and in the interest of Wall street
gamblers.
]'resident Roosevelt's determined stand is backed by
the people.
Whom congress backs will soon be seen.
To such a contest there must be a definite issue. Either
the government must, in accordance with the condition,
control the railroads, or else it must be admitted that the
railroad corporations control the government.
Can there be any doubt as to the issue?
Is Man Sinking to Second Place.
Efforts of the owmen to attain equality with men have
long furnished more or less hilarious amusement to men
serene and satisfied with their sense of natural superiority.
But the laugh is shifting to the other side.
So long as the women meekly confessed their infer
iority hy making their pleas for equality t<> superior man
and left him as sole arbiter, they were amusing. But now
they have taken the ease out of the hands of such preju
diced judges and taken it into a higher court from which
there can be no appeal.
A Bpecial bulletin issued from the census bureau sets
forth modestly and concisely the portentous fact that in
this country, as a whole, illiteracy is less among women
from the ages of 10 to 114 than among men.
Here is something to cause self-satisfied and serene
man suddenly to sit up and take notice.
The census report further declares:
"Changes which tire now in progress point to tlie com
ing of a time when females of all ages will be less illiterate
than men."
When that time comes what is to become of man's
complacent assumption of superiority t
What will be his chance in the contest for supremacy
with a sex better equipped mentally and with all the subtle
advantages of learning against him?
Woman, with superior intelligence, will no longer ask
him for equality, but deny him it.
Don't imagine thi£ is a dream.
Already an important organization of women ln!% not
only asserted the superiority of women, but has announced
its intention of visiting President Roosevelt and demand
ing of him that he use his influence to have the governing
power taken out of the bands of men, who have proved
themselves administrative failures, it is alleged, and turned
over into the hands of the women.
Surely it is time for man to cease swelling up with
pride over his self-asserted superiority and seriously de
vote himself to text books.

There is talk around town about
the Parker-Mullin fight is being
fixed. What started the talk is not
known, but in justice to Parker,
the following history is related:
A few year.-; ago Kid Parker was
offered and could have made $50,-
--000 to throw his fight with Young
Peter Jackson. eH was a 3 to 1
favorite in the betting when the
two fought at Denver. In one of
the early rounds a man approached
Parker and told him for the second
time to take the punch. Parker
would not take it and fought on
till the IStli round when he was
really whipped.
Parker is to get $200 for the win
ner's end of the local fight. He
has been promised a fight before
the S. A. A. C. in January in which
he will make about $1000. He must
win the -Mullin fight to insure the
second one. What object could
there be in Parker's throwing the
Mullin fight? It could only mean
a hundred or so in the betting, and
the talk seems preposterous.
Parker dropped into Tlie Press
office this morning, and when asked
about the report said: "I don't
care to talk about the matter as it
is so foolish. I am a fighter, and
if Mullin whips me he will have
to fight hard and win on tha
square. He could not buy me to
throw a fight, with all the money
he has or ever will have. I will
say, as I usually do, that anyone
who is not satisfied with the fight
on Friday night can get his money
back. I am In good shape and as
good as ever and intend to win
from all the 135 pounders in the
country before I get through."

Smith, the sporting dopster, has
received a letter from O. C. Lindh,
manager of Jack O'Keefe, stating
he is figuring on a go in Spokane
and would like to place Jack
against Gans or Gardner in Janu
ary. "Gans or Gardner," stated
Lindh, "with O'Keefe would make
the best fight ever presented to the
Spokane fans."
Jack is back in the mountains
keeping himself in shape for his
next fight.
Honey Mellody was introduced
to a crowd at Woodward's pavilion,
San Francisco, a few nights ago as
tho claimant of the welterweight
championship of tlie world. Some
of the crowd cheered the boy and
some hissed him. Honey stated he
was in California for a flght with
Sullivan and had $1000 posted for
the go.
Sullivan was introduced to the
crowd and stated mat he had a
fight with Gans in January for the
Ugthweight championship and after
that tight would go with any 133-
--140 pound man in the world. His
announcement was Taken as mean
ing that he would not fight Mel
lody.
This, as George Siler states,
gives Mellody the right to claim
the welterweight championship of
the world.

The Old Stile of Towerville.
It Was Where Nellie Used to Sit
and George Found Her.
By Virginia de Forrest.
That Old stile! It smwl on the
outskirts of the village was the
trysting place of the lads and
lasses of Towerville when our
grandmothers were young. There
was an old story in the village that
a young farmer, in the days of the
revolution, had hidden in some
bushes nearby and heard two Tor
ies, seated on the stile, discuss the
plan of attack on the next town
and by his warning saved the
place from being secretly burned.
Pretty Nellie Grayson, as she sat
there one afternoon pulling to
pieces the last boquet left for her
by some lovelorn farmer's son,
thought sadly of the many times
she had listened to the story with
her handsome lover, the guest of
the village, Geo. Law ton.
Poor Nel 11 ie! George was the son
of a lawyer who lived in Boston; a
man of wealth n-nd influence who
had been sent to recuperate his
healths at his cousin's, Nellie'
mother.
It did not take long for the hand
some, talented lawyer to win the
simple, trusting heart of the lovely
village girl. He had taught her
French. To him it was an amuse
ment to while away the dull hours
of country life and Nellie was an
apt puipl.
George had gone home. He had
spoken no word of love to Nellie,
though every look and action was
more eloquent than the most stud
ied speech. He wrote to her, but
the letters, though treasured by
her, did not fill up the gagp his ab
sence made, and as the vvillage
beauty sat musing on the old stile
no one would havo dreamed that
half the men in the little town
were in love with her. Of course,
she admitted to herself, George,
with his fine education and talents,
looked for accomplishments in his
wife and Nellie determined to have
these.
For two months she coaxed and.
persuaded her father to let her go
to a Boston boarding school for a
couple of years. He was rich. Nek.
lie was the only child, and at last
r
the unwilling consent of both par
ents was obtained and Nellie VM.
placed in the best school the illy
afforded.
Four years rolled rapidly away
and Nellie, now in her 20th year,

STRENGTHENING
THE DEFENCES
OF NEW YORK
(Scrlpps News Association.)
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 13 —
The quartermaster general of the
army has provided Tor Important
contract work at Fort Totten, New
York. This work includes repairs
to the building now used by the

the school of submarine defense.
Considerable interest is taken by
the artillery officers in that institu

COMPLETING
MINE SHAFT
(Scrlpps News Association.)
IRONWOOD, Mich.. Dec. 13.—1n
a few months the big new shaft
at the steel corporation's Chopin
mine at iron Mountain, Menominee
range, which was begun In August,
1903, will be completed. It has
been sunk now to a depth of about
1300 feet and will reach a depth of
1600 feet when completed. It is
22x12 feet in dimensions and in
cludes a pump column department,
a cage and two skip departments,
with a triangular space in the pump
department for a balance lift.
was one of the most cultured young
women in the institution. At tho
earnest solicitation of George's
mother Nellie went for a visit to
the Law ton homo before returning
to Towerville. George was in
Europe and his mother thought
this would be a goon time to return
some of Mrs. Grayson's hospitality
to her son when he was not at
home and in danger of falling in
lovve with a country girl.
Contrary to the mother's expec
tations, George decided to return
home at once and arrivved shortly
after the beginning of Nellie's stay.
The young man scarcely recognized
his cousin. She had changed onder
ffully in four years and decidedly
for the better. He was soon in
love, deeper than Nellie had been
when he left her, and the girl saw
her power. It was a long wooing.
The object of his affection gave
him little encouragement. When*
ever he spoke of love her innocent
little look of surprise was too much
for him and. accustomed to have his
attention courted, he was often on
the point of leaving her and giving
up the pursuit. Then, Nellie was
the belle. The boquets, invitations
to drive and visit the opera and the
notes she received from other ad
mirers drove George wild with
jealousy. Finally Nellie went home.
George soon found that out, and at
last, unable to bear suspense any
longer, he started for Towerville
determined to have "yes" or "no"
in answer to an important question.
As he drove slowly over the well
remembered road he paused near
the old stile. Someone was there.
George fastened his horse and
started across the field. Yes, there
she was seated on the stile, actu
ally dreaming, in her old gipsy hat,
just as he remembered her. There
was a stealthy step behind her and
before she knew there was anyone
near a pair of arms circled hor
waist and a darting kiss was
pressed on her lips. No use to re
sist. Nellie was a captive and the
old stile heard another love story
that afternoon and the city beau
carried Nellie home in his buggy.
