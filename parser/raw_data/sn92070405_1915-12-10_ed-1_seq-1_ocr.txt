II. S. FRENCH IS THE NEW
FOREMAN FOR LIBERAL
H. S. French, former editor and
manager of the Courier-Record of
Manistique, Michigan, accompani
ed by his wife, arrived in Lords
burg Saturday. Mr. French has
accepted a position as foreman of
The Western Liberal and will have
charge of the mechanical depart
ment together with important ad
vertising and news-end duties.
Mr. French is considered one of
the best newspaper men in Michi
gan and has held some very respon
sible positions in the state. He
was many years ago foreman of a
newspaper at Prescott, Ariz., but
returned to Michigan with the cus
tomary longing for the West still
with him. Hearing of Lordsburg
and its possibilities Mr. French ac
cepted the Liberal's offer and will
put his efforts into making a bet
ter commercial printing depart
ment here as well as a better news
paper. Mr. French is a cousin to the
well-known New Mexico cattle
owner in the northern part of New
Mexico after whom the town of
French, N. M., is named.
The Manistique Pioneer-Tribune
(Mr. French's opposition paper at
Manistique,) says of him as fol
lows :
"Editor French vastly improved
the tone and appearance of the
Courier-Record during his tenure.
In fact, during the past fourteen
months that paper was better and
more ably edited than at any time
in the history of that sheet.
"Mr. French worked hard, as in
addition to the management and
editorship, he was superintendent
of the job office. Professionally
he was ever courteous, - and the
1'ioneer-lnbune management re
grets to learn of his determination
to leave the community. He will
carry with him to his new field of
endeavor the best wishes of many
oi our citizens.

STATE LAND SALE
ON FEBRUARY 25
ONE of the most important
local mining transactions in
recent years will doubtless be
consumated in Lordsburg today
when final papers will be signed
for the financing of the mines
of the Bonney Mining Company
The deal has been pending for
the past two weeks and is ex
pected to be finally closed within
the next 24 hours.
John M. Sully, mining engineer
lorace Mose, mine superinten-
of the Chino Copper Company,
nad Mr. Thorne.General Manager
of the Chino Copper Company,
of Santa Rita, N. M. and Frank
R. Jones of Silver City, arrived
here late Thursday afternoon to
consult with the Bonney officials,
Just what the deal will mean has
not been given out but it is
generally understood that the
future development, and operation
on a large scale of the Bonney
mine has been arranged for.
The Bonney mine is the richest
in the local districts with an aver
age ore value of $20 per ton. Val
ues as high as $80 and $100 per ton
have been reached in many places
o-the Bonney veins. The values
on an average have been about
$4.50 per ton in gold; $4.00 per ton
In silver and $12.50 in copper. The
ore is not as high in silica as the
mines to the north of the Bonney,
but will hold up a good average of
69 per cent.
There are three deep shafts on
the property of the Bonney Mining
Company. The No. 1 is 120 feet
deep on a 76-degree incline. This
was the first shaft to be sunk on
the property. A prominent six
foot vein at the bottom of this shaft
has been worked during the past
few months by H. H. Sholly. The
values are about the same as found
at all parts of the mine.
The Number 2 shaft is 261 feet
deep with four levels and over a
thousand feet of lateral work de
veloping immense bodies of ore
The main vein at the bottom of the
No. 2 shaft is 19 feet wide carrying
excellent values and making it a
most desirable sniping ore.
There is an 18-horsepower boil
er, a 40-horse power horizontal
boiler, a 5-horsepower engine and
a 120-horsepower Ottumwa steam
hoist at the No. 2 shaft.
On account of a lack of adequate
dumping ground and for excellent
surface indications the Number
3 shaft was commenced early this
year, west of the No. 2. The Num
ber 3 is down 420 feet with four
level and a 25,000-galon pump on
the third level. The equipment at
the No. 3 consists of two 100-horse
power boilers, 2 100-horsepower
heaters; one 20-horsepower steam
hoist; a Sullivan two-stage com
pressor with three drills; rever
sible blower and a very complete
machine shop.
During the development work on
the No. 3 shaft several high grade
veins were encountered and at the
420-foot level the drills were three
feet in a 5-foot vein when a flood
of water rushed in driving the men
from their work. AH preparations
have been made, however, for the
handling of this water.
There are 17 veins on the Bon
ney property practically all of them
out-cropping at the surface in
widths up to 30 feet. The veins,
as far as can be determined, are
believed to be true fissures in an
desite, grading at places to diorit
and andesite-porphyry.
The strike of the veins Is 45 de
grees to the northeast and south
west and the din is 76 degrees to
the northwest. Practically all of
the veins are parallel. The copper
ore occurs as cuprite, chalcopyrite,
azurite, and malachite. The veins
are well defined at all points In
the mines and on the surface.
If necessary the Bonney ore can
be concentrated very successfully
by Wilf ley tables and v&nners, with
a plentiful water supply at the
mine for this work.
The Bonney is adjoined on the
south by the Misera Chest proper
ty owned by J. G. Berryhill of San
Francisco, Cal., on the east by the
Aberdeen, on the north by the KU
lebrew-Fairley claims and the west
by the Cobre Negra. The latter
two groups separate the Bonney
from the property of thf 8 Mm
Another gigantic state land sale
will take place at Silver City on
February 25, 1916, when State Land
Commissioner Robert P. Ervein
will auction off over one hundred
thousand acres of land in southern
Grant county.
The advertisement of the sale ap
pears in this week's issue of the
Western Liberal and will be car
ried tor ten consecutive weeks.
The Land Off.ce is now clearing
up all pending selections but as the
ppropnation of land has been ex
hausted no new applications are
being accepted. Petitions are be-
ng circulated requesting Congress
to make additional appropriation
for the state and it is quite pos
sible that this end may be accom
plished during the coming year.
SUNDAY'S FIRE
On Sunday afternoon at 5 o'clock
fire was discovered in the home of
N. J. Scott, owner of the Lordsburg
Garage. The fire alarm was sound
ed, and immediately a bucket brig
ade of willing workers was organ
ized, but despite their efforts to
keep the flames from spreading,
the house was totally destroyed.
The hose was put down from the
Southern Pacific hydrant, but it
was found to be too short for the
water to reach the lire, and the
home burned to cinders with about
300 residents looking on absolutely
helpless, with the exception of the
willing huskies who composed the
bucket brigade. "
The piano, kitchen range, some
of the furniture and clothing were
saved.
The house was insured, and was
the property of W. H. Small.
Several reports as to how the
fire started were given out, but
none were verified, and so ends
the third fire in Lordsburg within
ten days.
It seems too bad when houses
are at a premium to stand by with
arms and hands tide and mouths
wide open and see the houses burn
down, with no protection in sight.
SCHOOL NOTES
A well attended school patrons'
meeting was held at the school
house, Thursday afternoon, De
cember 2. It was decided to form a
permanent society for the further-
ment of all school purposes, the
name to be "School Patrons So
ciety," and the meetings to take
place the second Wednesday of the
month.
A temporary chairman and sec
retary was drawn up and perma
nent officers elected. Miss L. Hug-
gett was selected to serve as chair
man and Mrs. Marshal Lewis as
secretary. Committees were ap
pointed to draw up a constitution
and take charge of the arrange
ments for the Community Christ
mas tree. The teachers have charge
of the entertainment and the town,
the tree. In this means all of
Lordsburg will have a very merry
Christmas.
In a fast and exciting game, Miss
Huggett's girls won a basketball
game from the girls of Miss O'Con
nor's room, the score being 21 to
14. The girls showed great im
provement over their previous
games both in team work and
speed. The spectators all felt that
the teams will give any opposing
team a hard fight for honors.
The line-up was;
Miss Huggett's Julia Beam,
Dewey McGrath, forwards; Inez
Trimble, Inez Clay, guards; Doro
thy Close, Mary Beam, (side) cen
ter.
Miss O'Connor's Rosle Robson,
Annie McMeans, forwards; Ruth

center.
Substitutions Olivette Connors
and Lois Locklear as 'guards for
Miss Huggett's room. Eleanor
Long, Carrie James and Kathryn
Bailey as guards for Miss O'Con
nor's room.
Goals Julia Beam, 9; Dewey
McGrath, 1; Annie McMeans, 4;
Rosie Robson, 2:
Free throws Rosie Robson, 2;
Julia Beam, 1.
Last Friday evening the Stu
dents' Association gave a benefit
performance at the Star theater,
The proceeds, $28.75 went to the
fund for athletics. The show,
"Alias Jimmy Valentine," was ex
traordinarily good' and well appre
ciated by the large audience. The
association desjres to extend their
thanks to the town for their patron
age and to Mr. Briel for the reas
onable rate he gave the theater
and the show.
Unless the present arrangements
fall through, the Lordsburg Girls'
Basketball team will go to San Si
mon Saturday, December It. We
hope to take along many rooters

Do Your Christmas Shopping Early
By J. A. COLEMAN
The above slogan in the hands of an astute business man
changed the whole practice of Christmas shopping and stimulat
ed holiday business as nothing else could have done. This man,
with the nerve of a Barn urn and the judgment of a Wanamaker,
grabbed the thought from the public mind and put it. into big
black type, where "He who runs may read," in the newspaper I
He backed a popular conviction with his coin and advertised the
universal belief that it would be better for everyone concerned
if the inevitable Christmas purchases were made at once while
stocks were fresh and new and the choice was wide and ample.
The result not only paid the advertiser, as it always does
but the whole country profited beside.
This slogan has since slipped into practical use in every
corner of commercial America. Excepting perhaps its fellow
slogan, "Safety First," which reduced the accident death rate
enormously, it has done more good in the world than any other
..business phrase ever coined. It has been the means of dis
continuing the time honored practice among large metropolitan
department and specialty stores of keeping open in the even
ings for a week or two preceding Christmas eve. It has ena
bled manufacturers to prepare their goods and fill orders far
enough in advance to insure clear store rooms long before Yule
tide candles were lighted. It prevented the disappointment of
millions of Christmas shoppers who were wont in times past to
wait for the more attractive novelties which turned up at the -last
moment. And not the least important, it saves the heart
aches of neglected ones who leant upon the broken reed of
mere man's thoughtlessness. '
That phrase, "Do your Christmas shopping early," was in
stantly taken up and flashed before the eyes of the world
through the medium of its newspaper. Just as every other thing
worth while is told this nation of readers by the ever present,
constant, reliable, all-knowing, morning, evening, weekly or
Sunday newspaper. Nothing in the world is done without its
knowledge, nothing you want the world to know can be made
known without its aid. Almost any national manufacturer will
tell you that most of his fame and profit were the product of
newspaper advertising. No newspaper advertiser who kept it
up wisely ever lost money.
The newspaper pays this advertiser. The latter merely in
vests in business publicity. The cost of advertising is like a
phantom Zeppelin it never lights anywhere. It is a bugaboo
made of thin air and a yellow streak. The common supposition
that advertising expense is levied on the customer is likewise
fallacy. The fact of the matter is that the non-advertiser pays
for it out of the business he loses to competitors who do adver
tise. Advertising doubles output, halves overhead, divides sell
ing cost, and by making two customers buy where only one
bought before, it creates a hundred per cent Increase in pro
his own advertising; '
fit out of which any business man can well afford to pay for
