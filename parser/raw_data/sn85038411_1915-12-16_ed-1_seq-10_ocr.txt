PROTECT THE GUARD
GOVERNOR BRUMBAUGH'S views
on the continental army pro
posed by President Wilson in his
recent message to Congress will be
read with deep interest by everybody
who litis given thought, to the matter
of national defense. The Governor's
Keenly analytical mind picks out the
one big tlaw in the administration's
plan—which is the utter failure of
those who framed it to take into con
sideration the National Guards of the
various States and what will happen
to these well-organized forces in case
the contemplated continental army Is
created. Unless there is some dis
position of these organizations in the
thought of those who are urging the
continental army upon the country not
yet made public, the Governor is right In
his conclusion that to adopt the Wil
| ron-Garrison recommendations would
be to throw the Guard into the discard
in favor of an untried experiment.
[, Pennsylvania has developed a Na
-11 tonal Guard second to none in the
country and built along regular army
. lines to such extent that it could step
out of its armories into the service of
the United States almost without no
ilce and with 111 tie or no change.
There are hundreds of men within its
| ranks trained and qualified for duty as I
* officers in an army of defense should
the occasion arise. Without thought
| of pay and prompted by purely patri
otic motives the thousands of men who
go to make up the National Guard
sacrifice their time and their money to
attend drills and perfect themselves to
step into the trenches at the word of
command should the need arise for
national defense. The folly and injus
tice of discouraging and disorganizing
such an efficient and devoted fighting
l'orce needs no demonstration.
Nyr can It be that the Guard
has not developed military men of
Ability. Citizens of Htrrisburg well
recall our own Captain Thomas F.
Maloney, whose City Grays were the
pride of the whole State and whose
manual of arms was for many years a
standard military work. General Frank
Magee, General Thomas J. Jordan,
General Alexander Russell, to mention
only a very few of the figures well
known to Harrisburg,people who made
reputations for themselves and the
Guard In the State's service, are types
of the soldierly qualities developed by
Ihe National Guard of Pennsylvania.
Amorjg the living there is Adjutant
General Thomas J. Stewart as a strik
ing example of the caliber of men who
have for years been giving of their
brain and brawn to the forging of the
State militia into the efficient second
line of defense it is to-day. To dis
courage them, as the Governor says,
would be a grave mistake.
There is food lor thought in the
suggestion that the proper way in
which to develop the armed force of
citizen soldiery that the country ad
mittedly needs is to enlarge and de
velop the Guard. Advance worthy men ■
In the State's service to officcrships
and increase the number of regiments
and various branches of the service,
Pift' them for their time and give them
something to work for. Along this
line it might be well to give each regi
ment some insignia by which it would
bo known everywhere. The famous
Hlack Watch, for instance, is an ex
ample of what name and a tradition
will do for a military body.
But that aside, the thing to do, as
Governor Brumbaugh says, is to see to
it that we do not sacrifice that which
we know to be good for a very doubt
ful experiment.
HANK INTEREST RATES
JOHN SKELTON WILLIAMS, the
more or less controversial Comp
troller of the Currency, Is again
out with a broadside assertion that
the National Banks are charging
usurious rates of Interest. He has
been called to task for his loose criti
cism by the executive committee of
t lie American Bankers' Association,
which shows, in a public statement,
Ihat the comptroller fustens on one
| third or one-seventh of national
banks the charge of assessing exces
alve interest rates and points out tiial
THURSDAY EVENING,
consideration of the question numeri
cally 1s likely to be misleading.
In New York State, for instance,
there are nine guilty national banks
out of 478, and it is suggested that
the nine offending banks are little
institutions which have small part of
the $165,000,000 of capttal and a
still smaller proportion of the sl,-
580,000,000 of loans and discounts.
In Massachusetts there are three
offending banks out of 170. and in
Virginia five out of 136. Most of the
trouble seems to be In Georgia, where,
according to the comptroller, sixty
six bunks out of 113 are offenders and
the capital stock of all the national
banks in Georgia is only three-fourths
of the capital stock otthe Continental
and Commercial National Bank of
Chicago, while the loans and dis
counts of all the national banks in
Georgia, $62,000,000, are approxi
mately equal to the loans and dis
counts of the Irving National Bank
of New York. Alabama figures in
about the same proportion, with Texas
as a close second.
It is the opinion of the banking as
sociation, which has called Comp
troller Williams to acount, that his
statement Is absolutely misleading
| and' unjustifiable so far as it relates
Ito national banks in general. He is
charged with doing an Injustice to
the majority of national banks, and
as the chief offenders seem to be in
the Southern and Southwestern
States the bankers believe they are
warranted in the statement that the
alleged practice of usurious Interest
rates Is not general and is confined
to particular sections.
DON'T HIDE THE CANDLE
MUCH credit must be given the
Motor Club of Harrisburg for
Its excellent work in marking
the Lincoln Highway feeders between
this city 'and Gettysburg and also
along the other route to Lancaster, as
well as the road between Harrisburg
and Chambersburg. While the winter
weather interfered with the comple
tion of the undertaking, the club will
see that the markers are all in posi
tion with the opening of Spring and
the tourist travel.
The public generally, perhaps, does
not appreciate the importance of the
activities of this livewlre organization.
Harrisburg Is becoming more and
more a center of automobile travel,
and with the opening of the William
Penn Highway through the Juniata
Valley between Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh, this city is bound to take
its proper place in the highway sys
tem of the country.
It remains for the merchants and
the businessmen of all classes to do
their share toward the development
of Harrisburg as the hub of the State.
We have the great Capitol and its art
treasures, in addition to an extremely
picturesque and attractive city to
draw the strangers from afar, and it
only remains that these visitors may
be familiarized with the features
which ordinarily invite the stranger.
Of course, we are still short on
hotel facilities, but this glaring need
should not militate in the slightest
degree against proper effort in the
bringing of the great throng of tour
ists to this city. >
Fortunately, we have the Chamber
of Commerce, the Rotary Club and an
army of Intelligent ynd appreciative
salesmen, every one.of whom i£ an
enthusiastic missionary, and these
agencies and instrumentalities are co
operating with our citizenry in plac
ing Harrisburg upon the map of the
United States everywhere.
It is generally believed that we are
about to enter upon another period
of remarkable development and it is
the business, and ought to be the
pleasure, of all the people to stand '
shoulder to shoulder In the advance-I
ment of the best interests of the city, j
We may safely leave to the Motor |
Club an important part of this work, i
It has demonstrated over and over ]
again its ability to handle things well
and nothing that it has achieved is
more beneficial than the marking of
the highways leading to Harrisburg;
so that he who runs may read —with- j
out stopping his machine. As a mat- I
ter of fact, every highway, good and
bad, one hundred miles in every di
rection from Harrisburg should be
conspicuously and intelligently mark
ed so that the stranger cannot miss
this city.
We must-not hide our candle under
a bushel; It should shine not only
on Christmas eve, but throughout the
year and wherever possible to display j
the flame.
CITY AND STATE
ONE of the favorable signs of the
general interest in the work of
the City Planning Commission is |
the widespread discussion of its sev- i
eral projects for the improvement of I
the traffic conditions, especially In a !
reconstruction of the Market street j
subway and the proper treatment of ;
communication between the Allison
I Hill section and the Capitol Park i
zone. All manner of suggestions have j
been submitted by interested citizens'
and these suggestions indicate an in- ]
telligent study of the problem. It is !
by reason of this attitude on the part I
of our citizens generally that the city
planners are encouraged to go for
ward in their comprehensive and
fruitful work.
Growing out of the Capitol Park
problem is the decision to widen the
streets on three sides of the Capitol
grounds. This involves Walnut, Third
and North streets and it is clearly
the Intention of the State authorities
to broaden these highways so that
there may not be the congestion which
has heretofore been the cause of so
much criticism. With the develop
ment of the Commonwealth, tire Capi
itol and its surroundings are certain
to grow In importance and for this
reason, if for no other, the streets
leading to the State House should be
commensurate with the dignity of the
structure and its environment,
j The widening of North and Walnut
streets Is a comparatively easy pro
i position, as is ajso the increase of the
I width of Third street between Wal
jnut and, North. This is made pos
sible through a suggestion of an crni
. nent landscape designer who declares
lit la not necessary to interfere with
any of the trees along Third street;
that all that need be done Is to dis
pense with a sidewalk on the park side
and provide instead a footway along
the top of the short terrace from the
entrance jtf Walnut street to the exit
I at North street between the trees. This
I would give fifteen to twenty feet ad
ditional roadway and provide a much
better setting for the Capitol,
j It is conceded that in the revision
of the park lines, in the old section
as well as in the now, it will be neces
sary to regrade portions of the park
so as to make harmonious the treat
;, ment throughout.
Owing to the unavoidable absence
of Governor Brumbaugh on Tuesday,
the conference arranged between the
Board of Public Buildings and
Grounds and the City Planning Com
mission was postponed- It is under
stood, however, that the Governor's
interest in this subject is so great that
he will arrange a special sitting
for this conference to-day. It is a
happy situation that the State authori
ties are so ready and willing to co
operate with the city planners in
reaching a proper conclusion regard
ing the development of the Capitol
Park and its surroundings, so that
when the work shall have been com
pleted it will be dignified and credlta-
I ble to all concerned.
Long ago Harrtsburg realized the
importance of expert counsel in all
its public improvement undertakings,
and Governor Brumbaugh's personal
■experience as a planner in Philadel
phia, as well as the interest of Audi
tor General Powell and State Treas
urer Young in the development of the
State property, insures broad and
generous and intelligent consideration
of all the problems involved.
CK
By the Ex-Commttrccmnn
Considerable attention is being
given throughout the State to re
marks by Mayor-elect Thomas B.
Smith, of Philadelphia, that he in
tends to keep factionalism out of the
Philadelphia city councils and the
Republican city committee in Phila
delphia. Following his statement
that he would <iot countenance any
factional fighting over national dele
gates in the State this is taken as
significant of the attitude of many
prominent Republicans throughout
Pennsylvania. The Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh mayors have come out
against any disruption of the Re
publican party by a fight over na
tional delegates and against "Senator
Penrose and the remarks of the Phila
delphia mayor-elect are taken as a
reiteration of his stand.
The Philadelphia Inquirer says, re
garding the matter: "Neither element
in the city leadership, it is rumored,
will be permitted to conspire success
fully against the men who have es
tablished themselves in the several
wards as representatives of the Re
publican voters of their respective
constituencies. The incoming ad
ministration, it is predicted, will seek
ti strengthen the hands of those who
have been looking after the party
management in the several wards'
and who have by their election to the
Republican City Committee demon
strated their strength with the poten
tial men in their respective Republi
can Ward Executive Committees.
—-Governor Brumbaugh reiterated
his belief that next year was going to
be a Republican year in an interview
while in Washington on Tuasday. The
Governor'also said that the Republi
cans would welcome anyone back, not
even making an exception of Roose
velt.
—J. Denny O'Neil is certainly on |
the war path in Pittsburgh. He says l
that the bosses in Pennsylvania are
an expert lot of "double-crossers"
and that they are shaking hands and
waving dirks at the same time. Mr.
O'Neil is saying things about Mayor
elect Smith and others.
—Mayor Blankenburg last night
gave a farewell dinner to the mem
bers of his cabinet. He said nice
things about them.
—Governor Brumbaugh last night
said that he li&d never asked or
authorized anyone to ask that he be
| invited to attend or speak at the din
ner of the Republican League of.
Clubs in Washington. Dispatches
were sent out last week that a request
for an invitation had been made for
him.
—Montgomery county officials will
continue deputies and clerks in
office.
—Goldstein, one of the men in
volved in the Pittsburgh election
cases, was acquitted yesterday, but
the jury put the costs on him.
—Up in Bradford county a dozen
| justices refused to serve after being
elected. They did not think it worth
while.
—According to the Pittsburgh
Gazette-Times M. Clyde Kelly, former
legislator and former congressman,
i Bull Mooser and insurgent generally,
■ will be a candidate for Congress in
j the McKeesport district against Con
gressman W. H. Coleman. Kelly got
j into Congress by defeating John Dal
| zell in the 1!I12 wave, but when
I things became normal he was signally
j defeated. It is now said that Kelly is |
I seeking the influence of J. Denny'
! O'Neil, who is a power in the district, I
I all of which goes to show a funny i
line-up in Allegheny.
' —State Fire Marshal Joseph L.

I His term as assistant director of

I until next month and he will retire
I from the hill with the month and the

"BUTTING IN"
Our compliments to Brother Perkins,
with whom it is so often the Sun's
felicity to disagree. We discover no
matter for controversy in his able let
ter to President Wilson commenting on
the Chief Executive's declaration at
Columbus tnat it Is "none of our busi
ness what the Mexicans do with their
Government," and Mr. Wilson's firm
I announcement further that "so long as
II have the power to prevent it nobody
shall 'butt in' to alter It for them."
Mr. Perkins does not address the
President as a private citizen but as
the chairman of the executive com
mittee of the national Progressive
party. The fact that his relation to this
formerly portentlous but now quiescent
organization gives a certain political
flavor to the communication does not
In the least impair the accuracy or the
force of the document. Mr. Perkins
tells Mr. Wilson plainly but respect
fully what a great many other Ameri
cans would like to have the chance to
tell him.
For example:
"When you refused to recognize
Huerta you certainly 'butted in in
I Mexico,"
"In the manner in which you "butted
in' in Mexico is found the root of all
the trouble and humiliation to which
our country has been subjected, not only
with Mexico but other foreign countries
as well."
"When you 'butted in' in Mexico you
demanded that our flag be saluted. You
sent our troops to Vera Cruz. You
brought out dead away and left our
honor behind. You abandoned your de
mand that our flag be saluted."
"The result is that our prestige to
day in every foreign capital is at a
lower ebb than ever before reached, and
I believe that ve.y many Americans
join me in the feeling that all this is
dlrectlv traceable to the fact that at
the beginning of the Mexican situation
you did not act as you now talk."
We hope that the historian to whom
it shall fall some day to recount in
enduring prose the good and the bad
deeds of the Administration of Wood
row Wilson \vlll carefully preserve this
fearless and veracious memorandum on
"butting in" in Mexico now contributed
by the Hon. George W. Perkins.
| Indeed, it may even be said that in
this remarkably direct and forcible let
ter Mr. Perkins has furnished not only
l material for future history but also
evidence of his own capacity to be the
historian in case the political and finan
cial affairs of the national Progressive
party should perchance cease by and by
to engross his attention.

CONSTANTINOPLE
By Frederic J. Haskir.
L _ >
WITH the dllies striking at it by
land and sea through the Dar
danelles and the Germans
hammering their way toward it across
Serbia in order to effect a junction
with the Turks, Constantinople is one
of the greatest strategic points of the
war. Built at the natural entrance to
the Orient, standing between the Mos
lem and Christian civilizations, Con
stantinople has been an objective in
every world war since Emperor Con
stantine built it to be the Rome of the
East.
What will be the fate of Constanti
nople in the present struggle is an es
pecially interesting question because
of the great changes that have taken
place in that city as the center of the
Turkish Empire during the last seven
years. After centuries of Oriental
somnolence, untouched by the mighty
changes that swept over the West,
Constantinople has at last awakened
to the new spirit of liberty and, under
I the leadership of the Young Turks, is
I working out her own destiny along
modern lines. That destiny may be
greatly changed by the events of the
European war, although at present
both Constantinople and Bagdad are
resisting invasion with a vitality and
success that have astonished the
world. %
This new Oriental efficiency is im
bued with the spirit the Young
Turk, which has possessed Constanti
nople since the revolution of 1908.
Mystery and Dirt
Prior to that time, Constantinople
was the city of the Arabian Nights, a
place of mystery and dirt, of beauty
and squalor, the seat of a govern
ment by stealth and oppression and
extortion. Its ruler was the Sick
Man of the East; its people lived still
in the Middle Ages.
At that time, Turkey was an abso
lute monarchy, with the Sultan as its
temporal head. Being recognized as
the chief successor of the Prophet, he
was also its spiritual head. In ef
fect. Turkey was not a nation at all,
but simply a region inhabited by many
different races, held in check by the
all-powerful Moslems.
This rule of the Sultan was a thing
most picturesque. Owing responsibil
ity to no one, he gathered about him
a large kitchen cabinet, composed of
all sorts of upstarts who had managed
to gain a hold upon the Sultan's favor.
Some of them were ministers, some
chamberlains, some secretaries.- One
of them was an astrologer, who during
the attempted revolution of 1897 gain
ed great credit with the Sultan by
prophesying the arrival of messages
by telegraph. This he accomplished
by the simple process of bribing oper
ators and holding telegrams up.
1 THE STATE FROM DAT TO DAY [
"What are you doing with my
safety-razor?" said the young man to
his pretty sister out in the western
part of the State. "I'm shaving my
eye-brows, sir," she said, and .con
tinued her task. The fad seems to
have started out in Chicago, and is
threatening the east, picking up
devotees in its wild eastern rush to
wards the Atlantic Ocean, where it
wil probably plunge into the waves
and die the death of so many of
these peculiar fads.
Courage is not a quality that is
displayed only on the battlefield and
in the trenches. There is a lad in
Philadelphia by the name of Joseph
Colodanto, only eight years old, who
a few nights ago injured his hand and
was forced to have three lingers
amputated. He refused an anaesthetic,
but begged the surgeon "not to cut
them oft too close; I want to be a
violin player." When the operation
was performed, the little fellow j
clamped his lipß, and although a tear 1
or two came voluntarily from his |
eyes, he made no outcry.
Police in the cities of Pennsylvania
are requested to be on the lookout
for Elizabeth Leasure, of Farrell, who
left her home several days a£o and
has not been seen since.
The Driggs-Seabury Ordnance
Company, of Sharon, has recapital
ized to the of $10,000,000 by
unanimous consent of stockholders.
' Six and one half millions will go to
wards paying for the Savage Arms
Co., of Utlca, N. Y., which plant was
recently taken over. The Savage
Company manufacturers sidearms
and a new light machine gun.
The Williamsport Gazette and
Bulletin recently rejected a SSOO rum
advertisement and announced that
the future policy of the paper would
be to accept no more advertising of
DECEMBER 16, 1915.
This "kitchen cabinet" was the real
power back of the throne anil the real
Turkish nobility. It derived its in
comes in the most 'various and devious
ways. One, for example, collected sev
eral hundred pounds a month from
the butchers for not inspecting the
meat too carefully. Another got a
dollar for every sack of flour import
ed, while a third allowed a Kurdish
chief to supply his kitchens with but
ter in return for certain immunities.
So these astute gentlemen lived upon
the fat of the land and built splendid
palaces upon the Bosphorus.
Young Turks Organizers
Meantime, great doings were under
way, of which they had not an inkling.
Leaders of the Toung Turks, banished
to every capital of Europe, were
spreading throughout the empire a
constitutional propaganda. Men in all
sorts of disguises were going among
the peasants and the soldiers. The
Sultan and his "kitchen cabinet/" al
though they did not know it, now
stood almost alone. The spirit of
fear, which was their strength among
I the people, was being slowly trans
muted into the spirit of liberty. When
the time for the revolution came
there was none t_o resist. Save that a
policeman was shot for tearing down
the banner of revolution in one city
and a dozen of the Sultan's spies were
hanged in another, it was almost
bloodless. Great crowds surged be
fore the Sultan's palace and besought
him with tears in their, eyes to take
an oath of allegiance to the constitu
tion. He and his forebears had tyr
ranized over them for centuries, but.
the spirit of loyalty was strong. Abdul
Hamid, however, apparently unmoved
by these great events and seeking only
to conserve his own power, turned
them away with some adroit words.
Whereupon, the leaders of the Young
Turks went to him and made him take
an oath upon the Koran.
Undoubtedly, this was one of the
| most remarkable revolutions in the
history of the world. This people
had lived all their lives bound hand
and foot by a tyranny which constrict
ed even their private lives. They
might not walk where they would, nor
say what they thought, nor worship
its they pleased. They paid their earn
ings to thieves in high places and lived
in a squalor which they could not es
cape. Suddenly, this people awoke to
the knowledge that it was free. Shout
ing crowds ran through the streets of
Constantinople and gathered about the
orators of the Young Turks on every
corner. Priests of different faiths,
who had never looked upon each
other, now saluted with a kiss. Greek
and Jew and Turk frolicked together,
with the fraternal freedom of religious
tolerance.
that nature. More and more papers
all over the country are adopting this
attitude, which 1s certain to help
materially in strengthening the power
of those who wish to diminish the
wide influence of liquor.

"HOLD F.VST THAT THOU HAST"
[Kansas City Times.]
A writer In an Eastern newspaper
said recently that the pulpit was not tlie
place to treat the question of national
preparedness. In a sermon last Sun
day the Rev. David L.olnaz, assistant
pastor of Central Congregational
Church, Brooklyn, N. Y., took exception
to this sentiment. His text was: "Hold
that fast which thou hast, that no man
take thy crown."
He outlined the history -of this coun
try, a haven of refuge for the oppressed
of all lands, its ideals a sacred trust
committed to us from above, its leaders
raised up to hold aloft the flaring
torch, and, he said:
"Be worthy of them and of your sa
cred trust. The tools, the material re
sources. the intelligence to use these
are heaven's free gifts to you; yours is
the responsibility to use them nobly,
and to guard.thenh loyally against every
foe. Expect no miracle to preserve
them Intact, if you should prove negli
gent. You have the power, the means
and the ability, to defend and conserve
them, if you so elect. God treats you
as competent, responsible beings, and
exnects you to do your duty; not as
babes and weaklings who m«v not bo
trusted to give a'good account of them
selves in the hour of danger. Guard
your trust; fulfill your high destiny;
'quit you like men. be strong.' 'Hold
t»-* that thou hast.'"
That is good common sense and good
Christianity.

"Shop early, watch your step and
above all watch your change" is the
advice given by one of the city's best
known businessmen in the course of a
talk yesterday afternoon on the gen
eral characteristics of the Christmas
rush In the city. This man has been
an observer of people and their ways
for many, many years and he says
that one of the things about which
most people are careless, and right
here In thrifty Harrisburg, too, is
change. "Count your change before
leaving the ticket, bank or any other
window where they hand out money.
They count when you put It in. You
count it when you get It out," said
he. "Give that mesago to the readers
of your newspaper. Why I could tell
you of thousands of dollars lost, stray
ed or stolen through failure to watch
change." What the man says is
right. During this busy holiday sea
son many mistakes are made and once
away from the window the business
rule is not to make any alterations or
refunds or gifts. This rule, which is
as old as money, may work hardship,
but it teaches persons to oe careful.
One of the first things taught clerks
who handle money in stores and
banks, is Jo keep the bill to be changed
In sight, or note it on the sale book,
and count the cash before handing the
change to tl)e customer. If there is a
"kick," the clerk can tell at a glance
whether there has been a inistaku.
Sometimes a customer gets the worst
of it, and has no "comeback." One
of these cases came to the notice of the
oolice department the other day. A
man had a check cashed. He counted
the money and walked away from the
cashier's window. Then he counted
his money again. As he was leafing
over the bills, something dropped to
the floor. He picked it up and found
it was a figure "2." It had been pasted
over the figure "1." on a ten-dollar
note. Three persons had overlooked
the defection on the note. The gentle
man in question was out just ten dol
lars. He could not prove the fact
that the bank bill had been tampered
with before he got it.

The story in last evening's Chat
column about the ocean liners Siberia
and Mongolia meeting in mldocean
and transferring Chinese stowaways,
has an interesting sequel that Is worth
mentioning. The Siberia, of the At
lantic Transport Line arrived in San
Francisco on Monday by way of the
Strait of Magellan and will hence
forth ply between London and New
York, in the service of the Interna
tional Mercantile Marine, carrying
only cargo. The Mongolia, which also
figured in our story, will follow the
1 Siberia's lead and with the Manchuria
and the Korea, will go into the mer
cantile marine service. All four lin
ers are American built and fly the
■ American flag. The New York Sun
in the course of an editorial refers
to the fact that these ships hitherto
engaged in the Pacific trade appeared
in New York harbor decked with their
1 names and the American flag such
ships plying the Atlantic adopted
some months ago as a precaution
against submarines.
A. B. Farqulinr, .the York manufac
turer who was here yesterday, is one
of the foremost men in the State in
conservation matters and has given
freely of his time and means to furth
er projects for the good of coming
generations. He came here to attend
a meeting at the office of the Gover
nor.

THE THEORY AND \HE FACT
[Philadelphia Ledger.]
Confronted with a crisis the gravity
of which It would bo futile to belittle,
the President continues to indulge in
vague generalizations regarding the
national duty. America, he says In his
latest speech, is to preserve her poise,
to malntuin an attitude of friendliness
toward all the world, to be a medi
ating Influence for peace. "I do not
believe," he adds, "that there is going
to be any patched-up peace." Perhaps
it is a recognition of this fact which
leads him to disclaim the project of
"governmental mediation." He must
realize by this time that the attitude
of all the belligerents is such that we
are the last people whose Intervention
would be gracefully received. So he
now contents himself with a desire for
"spiritual mediation." It is to be a
kind of absent treatment. How It
might work if America had no Immedi
ate interest in the conflict there Is no
occasion to inquire. When the Presi
dent turns from theory to fact he will
find much more important questions
pressing for a decision. And the Issue
which they raise is so serious that he
can no longer befog it with words.
THE PEACE SHII*
By WliJfc Dinger
There once was a fellow named Ford,
Who disliked the way some countries
. warred,
So he chartered a ship
For a special peace trip.
Which got rid of a chunk of his hoard.
Then to this and that peace advocate
His plans he did promptly relate,
And said: "If with me
You will go 'cross the sea
On my peace mission I'll pay the
freight."
Did they go? well, not all, but some
went.
More on pleasure than peace, no doubt,
bent.
For they surely must know
That those nations won't whoa
At the call of this peace-making gent.

Thrift
Thrift is the art of making
the best use of what we have.
It is the genius for saving
for buying wisely.
And the basis of thrift Is
knowledge.
It means ability to rate a
dollar at its true value, to buy
the right thing at the right time
and' pay the lowest price.
People with the thrift sense
get full value out of their news
paper by making full use of the
Information in the advertising.
They know the market bo
fore they shop.
