FRIENDLINESS
IS INSPIRED
BY HARDING
President-Elect Meets Many
Persons in Washington
Does More Listening Than
Talking Plans Policy.
SEES SOLEMN DUTIES
By MARK SULLIVAN
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 8 When
Senator Harding left Washington on
Tuesday afternoon, he had spent al
most exactly 40 hours in the capitol,
he saw a pood many persons, and they
told him a good many things. Hard
ing himself did more listening than
talking. About the only thins that he
himcoir r,uiooi oa o , t
looking to as early action as is rea-jm
sonable on what is convenientlv called
the League of Nations question, but is,
in fact, the whole problem of our for
eign relations. He brought this up
with several members of the senate
committee of foreign relations, and
with other senators, and urged action
on their part looking to arriving at
common ground for action. Senator
Harding has been himself a member
of the foreign affairs committee and
sat with it during all the sessions
that dealt with the League of Nations.
He knows the various points of view
held by individual members, and he
tried on Monday and Tuesday to make
a beginning toward finding common
ground on which all these differing
views can meet
This is about the only affirmative
thing that Harding did, about the only
thing in which he took the initiative.
But he listened to a lot of other things.
Among the suggestions laid before
him by one or another of those who
called were the following:
Urged to Appoint
He was urged to name his secretary
of state and his secretary of the treas-
ury immediately, without waiting until
he has made up his mind about the J
cauiuei as a wnoie. i oe luea or inose i
who urged this course was that the
names of these two officials would
carry a certain amount of weight with
the public and would givo business
men and others interested a basis
upon which to make their calculations
for the future. It was urged, also, !
that these two officials should have!
a good deal of time before the 4th of
March in which to study thir prob
lems and prepare themselves for
prompt action after they take office.
To this suggestion Senator Harding
gave no sign or assent or dissent
He was urged to ask the committee ;
on finance of the senate to begin to 'official family will be complete be

nothing except to express a whole-; correspondence that has accumulated
hearted conviction that the taxes j since he left for his vacation on Nov.
should be revised as early as practic- 6. He also hopes to find opportunity
able.
Bond Plan Urged.
Incidental to this plan for revision
of taxes. Senator Harding was urged
to give his endorsement to a plan for
lefunding the government debt, a plan
which would extend all the Liberty
Bonds for CO years and would divide !
the refunding issue into three classes
of bonds. One class free of income
taxes on large incomes, another free of
income taxes on medium incomes, and
a third free of income taxs on small
incomes. The purpose of this division
is, of course, to make the new issue as
attractive as possible to different
groups of investors.
Senator Harding was urged to assert
leadership of the Republicans in the
present Congress, without waiting
until March 4. He was urged to act

HARDING, REFRESHED,
WORKS ON POLICIES
FOR ADMINISTRATION
MARION, O., Dec. 8 With his re
turn to Marion today from his vaca
tion trip to the tropics. President-elect
Harding was ready to begin actual con
structive work on the policies of the
coming administration.
In Washington during the last two
days he felt out opinions on many sub
jects and he let it be known today
that he was well pleased with the re-
Isult. He told his friends that he be-
lieved his ideal of party government
and common understanding-had been
furthered by his talks with Republican
icautrs in auu uui oi tuugicoa .iuu
that his canvass of sentiment regard
ing an association of nations had been
particularly encouraging.
The work done in Washington was
purely preliminary, however, and at
least some of the senators with whom
he discussed foreign affairs will come
to Marion later to take part in the
league conferences that are to begin
early next week.
Consultations Continue
Meantime consultations about se

FARM CROPS
POOL URGED
FORRELIEF
Lever, Joint-Author Agricul
tural Extension Act, Recom
mends Nation Wide System
to Steady Values.
BANKS ARE DEFENDED
By WILLIAM R. SANBORN.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Dec. 8. "Ag
riculture is the greatest of all profes
sions, involving the labor of 49 per
cent of our people, and has $25,000,
000,000 of capital invested," said A.
F. Lever, at the Farm bureau con
vention on Tuesday evening. Mr.
Lever is joint author of the Smith
Lever agricultural extension act.
The speaker recommended that a
nationwide system of pooling farm
products in bonded warehouses, under
national or state control, be devised,
to prevent the flooding of our mar
kets at harvest seasons. Mr. Lever
pays that it takes 12 months to pre
pare the land, sow the seed and to
cultivate, harvest and market our var
ious crops.
A system which would lead to the
marketing of our crops over tn"e en
tire crop year, instead of forcing 75
per cent of the output on the market
in four months, would steady values,
r.nd act to prevent the annual drop in
prices, every year. None of this can
be accomplished under our present
credit machinery, said the speaker.
Outline of Lever Plan.
The Lever plan as outlined, would
embody the following features:
1. The standardization of staple ag
ricultural producs of a warehousable
character, into grades or classes.
2. The building of a system of
bonded warehouses and elevators for
these products, under federal, state or
both, regulation and inspection.
3. The issuance of uniform ware
house or elevator receipts for a given
product.
4. The pooling, regionally, of these
; warehouse receipts in the hands of
a government appointee.
5. The issuance against the pooled
receipts of a certificate or bond, and
iihe selling of the same to the invest
ing public at such rates of interest
as such collateral will command.
New Banking Laws Needed
Mr. Lever Insisted that our present
banking laws do not cover the needs
of the crop growers. The federal re
serve act has accomplished much.
"But neither the federal reserve act,
nor the farm loan act, furnishes the
kind of credit necessary, if a real
system of orderly marketing is to be
built up."
"By the application of principles of
business already operating success
fully, the thing can be worked out,
and this to the benefit of all our
people," said Mr. Lever.
Reserve Governor Talks
W. G. P. Harding, governor of the
Federal reserve board, made a most
vigorous defense of that banking in
stitution. He made a plea for the
American farmer to face the indus
trial crisis bravely, with no undue
feeling of anxiety or depression. There
was no ground for despair on the part
of the farmer, he said:
Mr. Harding declared that a wrong
idea exists in the minds of many
many that the Federal reserve system
has adopted a policy of radical defla
tion and that the farming interests
have been the chief sufferers from
this policy.
"No such policy has ever been un
dertaken," Mr. Harding asserted. "As
a matter of fact, there has been dur
ing the past year an increase In the
net volume of bank credit in currency,
but efforts have been made to correct
abuses and to bring about modera
tion and better judgment in the use
of credits, which a year ago were be
ing diverted into all kinds of specu
lative and non-productive channels."
Mr. Harding declared that efforts
have been made to conserve the re
sources and credit power of the Fed
eral reserve banks in order that they
may better respond to the seasonal
needs occasioned by the harvesting of
the crops.
"Remember," he continued, "that
things are not as bad as they seem,
and that the morale which is so nec
essary for an army to maintain in
military campaign U just as essential
in fighting industrial and business de
pression. Let us look on the bright
side, and take care before advocating
measures which seem to promise tem
porary relief, to consider their ulti
mate results.
Organization Work Program
The work of the convention Wed
nesday Is being principally devoted to
matters of organization. Great inter
est centers in the annual election, to
! be held this evening. It is not thought
that J. R. Howard will have any op
j position to re-election as president, no
rival candidates being In sight.
Twelve directors will be elected and
there are numerous candidates in the
field. There are two prominent can
didates for the office of vice-presi-I
dent: John G. Brown, president of the

IN PRESENT CONGRESS
IMPATIENT AT DELAY
The Palladium Nfwn Bnreaa,
206 Hodw Office Building.
WASHINGTON, D C, Dec. 8 For
mer service men in the Sixth congres
sional district of Indiana are entering
numerous complaints over delays ex
perienced in having . their claims for
compensation acted upon by the Bu
reau of War Risk Insurance.
It is stated, however, that 'dissatis
faction with the methods of the War
Risk Insurance bureau is general
throughout the country and members
of congress realize that one of the!
most Important problems they are now
confronted with is a reconstruction of
that bureau so that it will function
properly.
A flood of complaints has been turn
ed loose upon the bureau in the past
few days by members of congress re
turning to Washington for the reopen
ing of congress. These complaints
were principally against long delays in
the consideation of claims for compen
sation and against disability classifi
cations given in compensation awards.
Complaint From Richmond
Among the complaints submitted to
Representative Richard N. Elliott of
Indiana to be filed with the bureau is
one that involves the case of a for- J
mer soldier living- in Richmond, Ind.,
who is now unable to do any work be
cause he is suffering from tubercular
peritonitis and who has been awarded
only $18 a month compensation not
withstanding the fact he is married.
Reclassification of disability has
been asked for another Richmond ser
vice man. who has been unable to
work for several months because of a
dilated heart and who now receives
only $13.50 a month compensation, al
though he is married and has a wife
and baby to support. This small award
was granted to him several months
after his claim for compensation had
been filed.
Soldier Suffers
The American Legion Post in Rich
mond has called attention to the case
of another former service man suffer
ing from tuberculosis and said to be
unable to do any work who is receiv
ing only $23.50 a month, on which he
is expected to support himself, his
wife and a child. It is stated that the
Red Cross has been obliged to assist
this man from time to time.
An opinion freqqently expressed in
Washington is that the system under
which the bureau of War Risk Insur
ance operates is too cumbersome ever
to accomplish satisfactory results.
Recommend Branches.
It has been recommended that the
plan of having all compensation and
insurance claims pass through a cen
tral office in Washington be abandon
ed and that regional branches for the
bureau be established throughout the
country. It is .contended . that under
such a system consideration of claims
would be facilitated and that the bu
reau would be better able to keep in
personal touch with former service
men.
It is understood that after the first
of next year both house and senate
committees intend to make investiga
tions of the bureau for the purpose
of formulating some plan for a com
plete reorganization.
American Legion Posts throughout
the Sixth Indiana congressional dis
trict have plainly indicated their dis-
j rpproval of the bureau as now organ
ized and operated.
WAR COST AMERICA
24 BILLION DOLLARS
NET, SAYS SECRETARY
(By Associated tress)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 8 The net
cost of the war to the American gov
ernment was fixed by Secretary Hous
ton today at $24,010,000,000. This, he
said, represented the "adjusted" ex
penditure of the treasury, excluding
all other outlay which,, had no rela
tion to the actual prosecution of the
war during the period from April 6,
1917, to June 30, last, which he said
covered the extremes of ths govern
ment's war time fiscal operations.
Total expenditures by the govern
ment during the period covered, ex
cepting only postal disbursements from
postal revenues, were $38,830,812,895,
treasury figures showed. Of this
amount, $16,078,S44,097 was obtained
in taxes and revenue from sources
other than borrowed money.
Mr. Houston said a deduction of $9,
523,000,000, the amount loaned to for
eign governments, should be made
from the grand total since these loans
will be repaid and consequently can
not be charged as an actual expendi
ture. The secretary made other de
ductions aggregating approximately
$4,500,000,000 which he said represent
ed the excess cost of actual govern
mental operations for the three years
and three month over what they
would have been in normal times.

LEAGUE'S MILITARY
SCOPE CONSIDERED
BY GENEVA MEETING
GENEVA, Dec. 8 Relations be
tween the technical organizations of
the league of nations, as well as those i
Detween tne council and assembly,
were considered today by delegates to
the assembly meeting here.
It was expected the discussion of the
scope and powers of the military, nav
al and aerial commission might de
velop what connection it may have
with the league's international force
that is being sent to supervise the ple
biscite in Lithuania.
On one occasion Lord Robert Cecil,
delegate from South Africa, referred
to this commission as a "staff". This
appellation however, was distasteful
to many delegates who do not care to
encourage the idea of the militarization
of the league.
May Provoke Conflict
I The possibility of conflict between
the league and the various powers
'has arisen as a result ot ths decision
'of the committee on admission of new
1 states respecting Albania and it is
likely to be discussed on the floor of
ithe assembly vh?n that
committee's
report is considered. Lord Robert
Cecil has insisted stoutly that Albania
i should be admitted to the league.
Rene Viviani of France and Signor
iPagliano of Italy have opposed this
I step on the ground that Albania has
not been recognized by any
rovrpp
and that admission at this time might
interfere with national policies of
some governments.

Ask Investigation
When it became known, fhortly
after the Farmers bank of Milton
failed and a shortage of between
$100,000 and $125,000 in the accounts
of Cashier Oscar M. Kirlin was dis
covered, that Treasurer Weidner had
on deposit there county funds in ex
cess of the legal maximum, authori
ties asked for an audit of his books.
At the time of the failure of the in
stitution he had $47,551, including four
certificates, on deposit in it. Weid
ner, as county treasurer, filed a claim
of $27,551 for the county against the
bank, but previously, when Oscar M.
Kirlin committed suicide, Weidner
went to a Richmond bank and paid
the county $20,000, taking over the
four certificates, Prosecutor Freeman
said.
The prosecutor said the county
would not lose the $27,551 in the de
funct bank, as the stockholders of
the bank must make good all losses,
which will protect the county's money.
Exceeds Maximum Sum
At one time Treasurer Weidner had
as high, as $55,000 of the county's
money on deposit In the bank.

four certificates of deposit belonged to
Weidner personally. Instead of depos
iting county funds by sending county
money, he took out $20,000 himself and
then indorsed the four certificates
over to the county. Exchanging these
certificates for county money consti
tuted embezzlement, under the stat
utes. Prosecutor Freeman 6ald. In
that event, the bank, under Its bond,
would not be liable for the payment
of the four certificates, because they
were not Issued on a deposit of the
county, the prosecutor said.

request from Prosecutor Freeman.
