ful to the precept of avoiding entangling

RUSSIA PROVES HER ADHERENCE TO

Claims growing out of the seizure of
American sealing vessels In Reiing Sen
have been under discussion with the gov

the recent happy result of an agreement to
submit them lo the decision of a single nr

AS TO THE INDEPENDENCE OF CUBA.
My annual niessacre last year was neces

tion of the Spanish war and of the results It
wrought and the conditions it Imposed for

the treaty of peace lias restored friendly

has been given to Its most Important provi

been accomplished on October IS. ISPS.
The withdrawal from Cuba was effected

OUR POSTAL SEHVOE AT HOME AND
AP.ROAD.
Though Puerto Rico and the rhlllnplnes
hold a different relation to the United
States, yet for convenience of administra
tion the siinic principle of an autonomous
system has been extended to them. The
development of the postal service In nil of
the Islands has b-en raiild and successful.
It has moved forward on American lines,
with free delivery, money otd.T and regis
try systems, and has given the people mill
facilities far greater and more reliable than
any they have ever before enjoyed. It is
thin tini only n vital agency of Industrial,
social nnd business progress, but mi impor-
1 lant Influence In diffusing a Just under
standing of the true spirit and cUnrncter or
American ailnilnlsl ration.
The domestic postal service continues to
grow with extraordinary rnplditv. The ex
penditures and the revenues will each ex

the treatment of some classes or mall mat

matter had been properly classi

have paid, Instead of n postal deficit for

a surplus. The reform thus suggested, in
the opinion , of the Postmaster General,
would not only put the postal service nt

THE PHILIPPINE QUESTION DIS
CUSSED. On the 10!h of December. ISPS, the treaty
of neiice between the United States and
Spain was signed. It provid -d among oth
er things that Spain should cede to the
United States the nrchip, lago known as the
Philippine Islands: that lhe United Stat-s
should iiav to Spain the sum of twenty mil
lions of dollars, and that the civil rights
and political status of the native Inhabi
tants of lhe territories thus ceded to the
United States should be delei milled bv th
Congress. The trentr was rntitied by tlie
Senate on tlie 11th of February. lS'.i!). nnd bv
the Government of Spain on the ltllh of
March following.
In this manner the Philippines came to
the United Slates. The islands were ced 'd
by the Government of npain. which had
boon In undisputed possession of them for
centuries. Thi y were accepted not merely
by our authorized ooimlssio'iors in Paris,
under the direction of -he Execuilve. but
bv lhe excellent and well-considered action
of the representative or the people Pi the
United Slates, In both Houses of Congress.
I had every reason lo believe, mid I still
believe, that this transfer of sovere'g-ity
was In accordance with Hie wishes and the
aspiration of Hie great muss ef the Hit
pino people.
From tlie ei'-llest moment, no opportnn

that we come. tmi as Invaders rind con
queror, lint as friends, to protect the na
tives In their Homes, in their employments,
and In their personal and religious rights."
On the 21st of January I itnnnunced my
Intention of dispatching to Manila a com
mission composed of three gentlemen nf
the highest character nnd distinction, thor
oughly acquainted with the Orient, who. In
association with Admiral Dewey and
Major General Otis, were Instructed to
"facilitate the most humane and effective
extension of authority throughout the Isl
ands, mid to secure, with tlie least possi
ble delay the benefits of a wise and gen
erous protection of life aud property to the
inhabitants."
While the treaty of pence was under con
sideration In the Senate, these Commis
sioners set out on their mission of good
will and liberation.
Hut before their arrival at Manila, the
sinister ambition of a few lenders of the
Filipinos had created a situation full of
embarrassments for us and most grievous
In Its consequences to themselves. The
clear nnd Impartial preliminary report of
the Commissioners, which I transmit here
with, gives so lucid and comprehensive a
history of the political Insurrectionary
movement that the story need not be here
repeated. It Is enough to say that t lie
claim of the rebel leader, that he was
promised Independence by any officer of tho
United States in return for his assistance,
has not foundation In fact, and Is categori
cally denied by the very witnesses who
were called to prove It. The most the In
surgent leader hoped for when he caine'to
Manila was the liberation of the Islands
from the Spanish control, which they had
been laboring for years without success to
th"ow off.
The prompt accomplishment of this work
by the American army and navy gave him
oilier Ideas nnd ambitions, ami Insidious
suggestions from various quarters pervert
ed tlie purposes nnd intentions with which
he had taken up arms.
No sooner had our army captured Man
ila than the Filipino forces began to as
sume an attitude of suspicion and hostility
which the utuioet efforts of out- ouicera anu
,.!,!!. li-hment -f lieneneent government,
which hoi.ld sfTord the fullr t sevunty f r
life rt. n.ier'T.
On the "lt of lieeetriHer. sfTer the trt
troops were unable to disarm or mod'fy.
Their kindness and forbearance were taken
as a proof of cowardice. The aggressions
of the Filipinos continually Increased, un
til finally, just before the time set by the
Senate of the United States for a vote upo'i
tlie treaty, au attack, evidently prepared In
advance, was made all along the American
lines, which resulted In n terribly destruc
tive nnd Duugulnnry repulse of the Insur
gents.
I his was the unhappy conuition or nn.iirs
which confronted our Commissioners on
their arrival lu Manila. They had come
with the hope of establishing pence mid
order. What they actually found can he
best set forth In their own words:
"Deplorable ns war Is, lhe one In which
we are now engaged was nun void side by u-.
We were attacked by n bold, adventurous
nnd enthusiastic army. No alternative was
left to us except Ignominious retreat.
"It Is not to be conceived that any Ameri
can would have sanctioned the surrender
of Manila to the Insurgents. Our obliga
tions to other nations and to the friendly
Filipinos and to ourselves mid our ling de
manded that force should be met by force.
Whatever the future of tne Philippines
may be, there Is no course open to us now
except the prosecution of the war. until
the insurgents are reduei d to submission.
The commission is of the opinion that
there has been no time since the destruc
tion of the Spanish squadron by Admiral
Dewey, when It whs possible to withdraw
our forces from the islands, either with
honor to ourselves or with safety to the
Inhabitants."
The course thus clearly Indicated has
been unflinchingly pursued.
The rebellion must be put down. Civil
government can not be thoroughly estab
lished until order is restored. With n de
votion and gallantry worthy of Its most
brilliant histoiy, the army, ubly and loyally
assisted by the navy, has carried on this
unwelcome but most righteous campaign
wilh richly deserved success. Although
their operations have been somewhat In
terrupted and checked by a rainy season
of unusual violence and duration, they have
gained ground sleadllv lu every direction,
nnd now look forward confidently to a
speedy completion of their task.
The unfavorable circumstances connect
ed with an active campaign have not been
permitted to interfere with the equally Im
portant work of reconstruction. A notable
beginning has been made lu the establish
ment of a government In the Island of
Negros, which Is deserving nf special con
sideration. This was the first Island to ac
cept American sovereignty. Its people un
reservedly proclaimed allegiance to the Uni
ted states, ami aiiopieu a constitution
looking to the establishment of a popular
government. It was Impossible to guaran
tee to the people of Negros that the consti
tution so adopted should he the ultimate
form of government. Such a question, un
der the treaty with Spain, and in accord
ance with our constitution and laws, come
exclusively within the Jurisdiction of Con
gress. 1 lie government actually set up by
the Inhabitants of Negros eventually
proved unsatisfactory to the natives them
selves. A new system was put Into force by
order of the major general commanding,
the department.
The President gives nil details connected
with the new system of government of
Negros, which was put In force.
Everything Indicates that with the speedy
suppression of the Tngalo rebellion, life
In the iirchliieliig.i will soon resume its or
dlnaiy course under the protection of on'
sovereignty, iii'd the people of those fav
ored islands will enjoy a prosperity and a
freedom which they have never before
known. Already blind; eds of schools are
open and filled wllh children.
The fin lire government of the Philippines
rests wbh lhe Congress of the United
States. Few graver responsibilities have
ever been eohtided to us. If we accept
them in a spirit worthy of our race and our
traditions, a g-eat opportunity conies with
them. The island lie under the shelter of
our lliiir. They are ours by every tble of
law and equity. They can not be aban
doned. If we desert tiieni. we leave them
at once to anarchy and Dually to barbarism.
We ti I ue them, a golden apple of discord,
miimig the rival powers, no one of which
could permit another to seise them un
questioned. Their rich plains nnd valley
would be bnt a scene of endless strife snd
bloodshed. The advent of Dewey's licet l-i
Manila Hay. Instead of lielng. as we hoped
the dawn of a new day of freed, mi and
progress, will have been the beginning of
an era of misery and violence, worse t bun any
which li.is darkened their unhappy past.
Tiie suggestion has been made that we
could enounce our authority over the 1-1-anils.
nnd, irlvln? them Independence, cm Id
retain n protectorate over them. Thl
pro;i e it ion will not be found. I um iure,
worthy of your si lection. Such mi ar
rangement would In'olve nt the oi:tel a
eiii, l leeach of faith. It would plme the
ie and loyal maturity who ssk for
tiling livtter than to scit-i.t our authority,

iirieiits. It Weill.! make n responsible
f r the acts of tne iusuigent leader, and
give u no Niwer lo control tlieiii. It
would ihaig u with the tnk of protect
ing the in ugalnst each other, slid defend

which tin j i loose to quarrel. In short, it
would tske from tlie t'uiigre i f the Uni
ted Mules the power of declaring vwsi an-l

which shall establish "and maintain rre--dom
and order uud peace lu the Philip
pines. Until Congress shall have mad knowt-
the formal expression of Its will, t sbaU
use the authority vested In me by the Con
stitution and the statutes to uphold tb
soverelgnty of the United Rtntes In th(
distant Islands, as In all other places wher -our
Hag rightfully floats, I ahull put at tho
disposal of the army and navy all tn
meaiis which the liberality of Congress and.'
the people have provided to cause this act
provoked and wasteful Insurrection' to
cease. Our flag has never waved over amy com--inunity
hut In blessing. I believe the Fili
pinos will soon recognize the fact that It'
lias not lost Its gift of benediction' liu
world wlde Journey to their shores.
A8 TO THE FUTURE GOVERNMENT
OF PORTO RICO.
I recommend that legislation to the game
end be had with reference to the govern
ment of Porto Rico. The time Is ripe for- '
la niliitttloii of ii tenionl-nrv form of riir. .
erument for this Island, ami maiiv sugges
tions made with reference to Alaska are ap-
pilcable to I'orto Rico.
The system of civil Jurisprudence now
adopted by the people of this Island. Is dis
covered by competent lawyers, who are fa
miliar with it, as thoroughly modern- audi
scientific, so far ns It relates to matters of '
International business, trade, production,
nnd social and private rights in general. .
The cities of the Islands are governed1 un
der charters which probably require' very
little or no change. So that, with relation .
to mutters of local concern aud rs-fvate -right,
it Is not probable that much If uaf
legislation Is desirable; but with reference
to public administration and the relation i
of the Islands to the federal government. .
there are many matters which are of press-
lug urgency. It must be borne in mind 1
that since tlie cession Porto Rico has been
denied the principal markets she had Ion -enjoyed,
and our tariffs have been coutlnv
tied against her products as when she was;
under Spanish sovereignty.
WHY CIVIL SERVICE ORDER WAS AM
M ENDED.
The executive order of May d, lM)fi. ex
tending the limits of the classified service,
brought within the operation of the civil
service law and rules nearly all of the ex
ecutive civil service not previously classi
fied. Some of the Inclusions were found wholly
illogical nnd nusulted to the work of the
several departments. After careful consid
eration it lieCRine evident that certain
amendments were necessary. These nmeiid
inents were promulgated by me in executive
order dated Slay 20, 1S00.
The places were comparatively few tov
number.
All of the amendments had for their main
object n more efficient nnd satisfactory nil- .
ministration of the system of appDiiitnrents..
ns established by the civil service law.
Presented to this Congress nre great op
portutiltics. With them come great respon
sibilities. The power conlided to ns Inv
creases the weight of our obligations to the -people,
mid we must be profoundly sensi
tive nf them ns we contemplate the nevr
nndgrave problem which confront us.
Alining only at the public g aod, we cult
not err. A right Interpretation of the peo
ple's will and of duty can not fall to In
sure wise measures for the welfare of the
Islands which have come under the author
ity of the l ulled Stales, and Inure to the
common Interest mid lasting honor of our
country. Never has this nation hnd more
abundant cause than (luting the past year
for thankfulness to God for manifold bless
ings and mercies, for which we make rev
erent acknowledgment.
