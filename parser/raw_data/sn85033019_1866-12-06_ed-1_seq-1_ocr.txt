day, by a vote of 111 to *2O, voted to repeal

authorized to grant amnesty and pardon
for political offences. This action has
been rendered necessary by the President's
gross abuse of the pardoning power. If

at once, let it at least pull out his teeth

President’ Message.
We publish on the second page of this
i-'sue the -President’s Message, delivered
at the assembling of the second session of
the thirty-ninth Congress, on Monday last.
We pride ourselves on being able so early
after its delivery to present this document
to our readers ; for although the people
have seen and heard enough of Andrew
Johnson to make them utterly despise him
and everything originating with him, they
have nevertheless such a deep interest in
the welfare of the country that this annual
message has been anxiously looked for,
and will be perused by more readers than
such papers usually are. The people are
anxious to know how the President ac
cepts the verdict of the people as delivered
in the late elections. And although they
know that President Johnson’s power for
evil is limited, and that the country is safe
notwithstanding his treachery to it and
his party, they would nevertheless rejoice
to hear that the President had “accepted
the situation,” discarded “my policy,” and
signified his willingness to execute in good
faith the laws of the country. But com
hr ary to the express wish of the people the
President refuses “to back down,” and re
iterates the sentiments and arguments in
support of what he calls his plan of res
toration, and which, by dint of frequent
repetition, .has become familiar to every
one. lie shows no indication that his
views or purposes in this respect have un
dergone any change, by reason of the em
phatic popular condemnation his policy
has lately received, hut is quite as anxious
as ever that representatives from the lately
rebellious states should bo admitted to
seats in Congress. lie has not a word to
say in regard to the proposed constitution
al amendment, and his silence on this sub
ject may be regarded as significant. Whhe
he denounces Congress by insinuations,for
usurpation ofJiowcr, and violations of the
Constitution, ho offers no explanation or
defense for his own extraordinary course
in appointing Provisional Governments for
the Southern States, and his other exercis
es of equally doubtful powers.
llis remarks on the report of the Secre
tary of the Treasury show that our finan
ces are m quite as good a condition as
could have been expected. Our national
debt is being rapidly decreased, a consider
able quantity of the paper currency has
been retired, and the secretary is said to
confidently look for the resumption of
specie payments iu ISOS.
II is statement with regard to our rela
tions with foreign powers, and especially
the negotiations with the French Emperor
on the vexed Mexican question, will be
read with some interest, as the first official
announcement of the action of the Govern
ment on this question.
Editor Dodgeville Chronicle —Sir: T
notice in your report of the proceedings of
the Rail Road meeting, you made an error
of fifty thousand dollars in a proposition
made by me for a settlement vvith the
Bond holders,
My proposition was to pay fit'ty thousand
dollars a year for six years, to be so divi
ded between the towns as to make each
town responsible for its own delinquent
list.
If that proposition was accepted and an
act of the Legislature passed to enable us
to carry itjaat, we could pay it without
much trouble; but I bad no faith in its
being accepted. I have over said the time
has never been when a compromise could
be effected, and believe it is the same yet.
M3’ object was twofold —to satisfy every
man that that was true, and to
show a willingness to pay a large amount
to clear off what has now become a legal
ized fraud upon the people.

Lit era rv Association. —We are happy
to inform our readers that the prospects of
this society are fair. It has procured a
very suitable, commodious, and comforta
ble room, has organized by adopting a con
stitution and by-laws, and electing the fol
lowing persons officers of the society :
President—William Hendy ; Vice-Presi
dent—James Roberts ; Secretary—Orville
Strong; Treasurer —Robert G. Owens;
Libarian —Thomas IV. Lewis. The mem
bership is not yet very large, but those
who'have joined manifest an interest in
the good work which is indicative of suc
cess. The Secretary has sent for a num
ber of periodicals and papers, and in a few
weeks we anticipate that the proposed
reading room will he opened for the ac
commodation of the members. The ad
mission foe being only one dollar, it is
within the reach of all to join, and we hope
that no young man will neglect this splen
did opportunity to provide himself with
reading for the wintef.
Diseases among Hogs. —We learn from
farmers from different parts of the county
there is a disease among their hogs which
proves very fatal. It is principally among
fat hogs, and is located in the throat. The
hog at first appears to be choked, and gen
-1 erally dies within a few hours. Somesup
! pose’it the Hog Cholera, others attribute
1 it to some other cause ; hut whatever it
i may be, the animal seldom recovers.
We are told also that a similar disease
| has made its appearance among cattle, and
i quite a number have died within a few
! days past.— Mineral Poi.it Tribune. '
devoted to the interests of tuk people.
County Bonds.
From the proceedings of the railroad
meeting, which we published last week,
it may be seen that the meeting proved a
failure, no compromise being effected. The
bond-holders refused to accept any propo
sition which the people were willing to
make ; and the people utterly refused to
acceed to the propositions of the bond
holders. The propositions made by Mr.
Beecher on the part of the bond-holders
were thought to be very honorable by the
people of Dodgeville, and some portions of
the northern part of the County; but those
from the south-east and west thought it
no inducement to have a railroad through
the County', and consequently opposed
every move in that direction.
We are surprised at the shortsightedness
and narrow-mindedness of those people
who claim that a railroad would only bene
fit a few towns on its immediate route,
and be no particular benefit to the County
at large. It would without doubt materi
ally enhance the value of every farm in
the County', and boa lasting benefit, pecu
niarily and otherwise, to every citizen.
The most foolish piece of business which
that meeting did was to adopt a resolution
to pay' the bond-holders the principle of
the bonds —$150,000 —and almost imme
diately thereafter adopt another resolu
tion, offering to pay SOOO,OOO. Such tran
sactions do not show the determination of
the people as they wish it to appear to the
bond-holders.
Nevertheless, from the footing manifested
by the people present, the knowledge that
the debt is an unjust one, and the almost
univeraal opposition to paying any more
of it than wo. a” actually obliged to, we
think the proposition which was offered
to pay $300,000 in six years, is the best
which the people will ever consent to, and
more than the bond-holders will realize if
they do not accept it. We trust they will
see it to their interest to accept the offer
of the people of the county, and that ere
long we shall forever settle the much vex
ed question of the lowa County railroad
bonds.
At the regular meeting of the Liter
ary Association of this village on Wednes
day evening last, the question was dis
cussed, “is light reading injurious to the
mind.” Thu decision was given in the
affirmative. A resolution was passed ex
cluding persons not members of the society
from the room during the progress of the
discussions ; but as a chance is given them
to join before the discussion is commenced,
those present who wish to stay can avail
themselves of it. On Wednesday evening
next the question will be discussed, “Re
volted, That the passage of a prohibitory
liquor law would be benefiicial to this
State.” The chief disputants are L. M.
Strong on the affirmative, and M. T. Cur
ry on the negative.
My Lost Love.
My life, my joy, my only love,
bios buried in the sweetest dell
That poet’snrt—caught from above—
Could e’er in rhythmic, measures toll;
Cut eh ! the place is black to me,,
And sadly sighs the willow tree.
That moans above her grave.
I hear no music in the trees.
The zephyrs sing a dirge to me,
The birds, the brook, the summer breeze.
Chant but a dismal threnody;
I would not heed the heavenly choirs.
Nor listen to angel ic wires.
Beside that little grave.
I Ihrow myself along the mound,
, And, tot,’ily checking every sub,
I strive to catch Ihe lightest sound
Of Die, —the faintest, fainte-t throb ;
But oh ! my love lies silent still,
And nothing hear 1 but the rill
That swoops beside her grave.
And, hoping she lias-waked at last,
I go nt, night, to that still ground,
And often has my heart beat fast
To see her kneeling at the mound—
” Twas only that the moonligh t shone
Upon the cold, white marble stone.
That stands to mark her grave.
Why do th e fairest violets grow
Upon my darling’s grassy bod ?
Because the stern clouds see my woe.
And soflest tears of pity shod
Upon her mound ; because (heairs
Of heaven, made quiet by my prayers,
Blow gently o’er her grave.
While Winter lingers on the waste,
And Snow drifts elsewhere clothe the gtouud*
Sweet Spring, with all iter train, make h.-.sto
To deck my lost love’s little mound ;
For since site was more pure than they.
Tits snows ali weep themselves away,
A nil die upon her grave.
At night the stars come out to 1111
Their places in the tranquil skies.
Ami all of them most pure and still
Gaze at her sod with sorrowing eyes ;
But oh ! my love was purer far,
3 ban any soft and heavenly star,
That watches o’er her grave.
That happy time 1 long for when
I shall rejoin my buried bride,
And in this little peaceful glen.
Two graves shall lie there, side by side;
When the warm shower* and breath of spring
Shall make the gentle violets cling
To our two quiet graves.
notice to Teachers.
Those teachers who have not already
done so, will please inform me as soon as
convenient, the name of the town and num
ber of the district in which they are teach
ing, the time of commencing, and the
length of the term f<>r which they are en
gaged, in order that f may distribute blank

Closing Stores.
Mr. Benjamin Thomas, jr., informs us
that every merchant in the village has
signed an agreement to close his store at
7 o’clock p. m. on every day of the week
except Saturdays, from the 10th of Decem
ber 1806 to the Ist day of May, 1867- —
This is a praiseworthy move, and those
who have been instrumental in bringing it
about deserve much credit. The main
object, as we understand it,is to give those
who wish to join the Literary Association
a chance to attend its meetings, also fo
visit the reading room when opened. This
arrangement will doubtless result in much
good, and if the people in the village and
immediate neighborhood understand that
no stores will be open after seven o’clock,
we don’t see that it can cause them much
inconven icnce.

THE BEST NEWSPAPER.
THE BEST POLITICAL PAPER.
THE BEST COMMERCIAL PAPER.
THE BEST FAMILY PAPER
THE LARGEST PAPER IN THE NORTHWEST.
It publishes more telegraphic news, better marl-pt re
ports, more interesting news, and a greater
variety of reliable information than
than any other paper in
America.
The Chicago Tribune, ipoty npproacfijng fts twen
ty-first year, is rftcogujzed as the leading organ and
exponent of the great, patriotic, dominant Rppubli
can party of the nortluyest. Tfte TpiBfJNE is riot an
ephemeral concern of doubtful duration, but a per
manently established ipstitptjon, (jnowp and respect
ed throughout the United States. Its circulation ex
ceeds the combined issues of the other Chicago dalies.
Its past record and career may be pointed to with
pride and pleasure by its conduct,one Since tjie Re
publican party was organized, The Chicago Tribune
lias stood by jt, through evi) as well as through good
report ;—never in the rear, but always in the front,
beckoning it onward and upward ; pevep faltering or
weary, but always hopeful, earnest, fearless. Its
blows have laden incessantly on slavery, oligarchy
and treason. During the entire period of the rebel
lion it blew no uncertain blasts, but sounded the
charge and cheered on the defenders of freedom to re
newed efforts, assuring them of a glorious triumph
for the right ps the rtwapd of fierseyorance and of
sacrifice, now, ij'Jion tjie wicked rebellion is
crushed,f Ije oligarchy conquered, and slavery abolish
ed, The CwiCAGjO Tribune, insists that the legitimate
fruits of our victory shall not be yielded back to van
quished rebels by an apostate executive, jyho has base
ly and wickedly betrayed the loyal people who in
trusted him with Jh.e presidential powers. The Tri
bune opens a new campaign In pec u re to the Union
an enduring peace, and a reconstruct ion based upon
equal rights and exact justice to ail men. It there
fore advocates impartial suffrage, irrespective of col
or or birthplace. Right wrongs no man, and no
man’s rights are abridged or endangered by giving to
every law-abiding citizen all his rights. And net
scheme of reconstruction will prove successful or en-''
during that denies equal civil and political rights
and privileges loany classof loyal citizens. No demo
crat can oppose impartial suffrage and equal rights
without shameful inconsistency and stultification.
Ami the south can never he free, prosperous or hap
py, until all its citizens are recognized as equal before
the law, and equal in making the laws, w hich they
must obey, regardless of color or position. The Chi
cago Tribune sincerely believes in the principles of
the declaration of independence, ami is therefore
radical in its aims, impulses and endeavors, and is
confident of witnessing, at an early day, the accep
tance and adoption ot tiro beneficent doctrines of Re
publicanism i every section and subdivision of onr
common country. The readers of The Tribune will
bear testimony that the policies it lias opposed have
generally been discarded; the measures it lias sup
ported have generally all been adopted, and that its
predictions have very near always come true. The
secret of it* influence on public affairs is, that it
espouses what is Bight, earnestly, and combats what
is wrong boldly ; and the glass with which it sees in
to the future is implicit faith iu the power of truth
and the ultimate triumph of the right.
A First Class Newspaper.
Tup, Cuicxgo Tribune, while fearless in the ex
pression of its opinions, and patriotic in its en
deavors, aims at Iteing a first class newspaper. It
brings the news to the people of the northwest sev
eral days sooner than the papers of the seaboard, and
surpasses all its cotemporaries in the northwest in
every department of news enterprise It discusses
every subject of interest to western men—moral, po
litical, literary, commercial and financial. No west
ern merchant, hanker, farmer, mechanic, drover or
manufacturer, can study hfs own interest and do
w ithout it. No farmer should sell a bushel of wheat,
corn, oats, or a pound of pork or beef without reading
The Tripp nr. No merchant should sell his goods
without reading Tin? Tribune. No manufacturer
should sell his wares before reading The Tribune.
No mechanic should dispose of the product of Ms
hands, without first consulting its well-filled,accurate
and reliable commercial columns.
