FRIDAY
WORDS THAT CHEER FROM
THE EXPOSITION MAKERS
AS its Christmas greeting to San Francisco the Panama-Pacific
international exposition, through President C. C. Moore, an
nounces that "San Francisco is fully one year in advance of
all previous expositions in the matter of general preparedness."
That is news to make San Francisco's stocking bulge with pros
perity and its head to swell with pride.
President Moore's statement, published in The Call mi Thurs
day morning, is a document which should be read by all San I* ran
dans, and the advice given by the president, that San Franciscans,
in sending their Christmas correspondence east, should include invi
tations to attend the 1915 exposition, should be followed.
We must not allow ourselves to take the Panama-Paciiic expo
sition too nuch as a matter of course. Its development is anything
but a matter of course; its progress is unprecedented. Procrastina
tion has no place in its scheme. The thing to be done is done today;
the things that have had to be done have been done on the instant.
The 94,089,000 stock subscription which started the finances of the
exposition was raised in one day; the site was selected early ; the
great exposition experts of the United States, men of international
fame, were engaged in the first days of the exposition, so that, the
work 1 would be started right; the foremost architects of America
were called early to the service of the exposition and have given
their services, their skill, their experience, their culture, to the cause
of the exposition, so that , when the palaces rise they will be the most
splendid structures ever reared in America. As an indication of the
standing of the exposition architects, the design of one of them,
Henry Bacon, has been chosen for the $2,000,000 Lincoln memorial
to be erected in Washington.
The activity of the San Francisco workers for the exposition has
touched a wire that has generated activity around the world.
Twenty-two foreign nations have accepted President Taft's invita
tion to participate in the exposition. Thirty-two states of the union
have taken steps to exhibit. Eight hundred leading exhibitors of the
world have voluntarily, without solicitation on the part of the expo
sition authorities, applied-for space at the exposition. Two thousand
concessionaires have applied for privileges.
The world is awake and echoing to the call of 1915, and San
Francisco must not become drowsy; it must keep up the interest
it has shown in the past; the spirit it showed in subscribing
$4,089,000 in one afternoon; the enthusiasm it showed when it
deluged Washington with telegrams proving why congress should
award San Francisco the honor of the exposition; the loyalty it
showed when it aided President Taft to turn the first shovelful of
earth for the construction work.
President Taft promised Mayor Rolph in Washington on
"Wednesday that he would be in San Francisco in 1915 when the
exposition opens. We want him here on February 20, 1015, with
President W r ilson, to assist in opening the exposition to the world.
For on the day the Panama-Pacific international exposition gates are
opened the world will have the opportunity of seeing its greatest,
most complete world's fair. And it will be "the exposition that will
be ready."
A mouse lost its way in the spectro-helioscope of the Mount

"Dollar Diplomacy" — Who Would
Exchange It for "Bullet Diplomacy"?
440 ÜBSTITUTE dollars for bullets," said President Taft in his
message to congress, expounding the principles which made
his administration contribute so successfully to the pros
perity and dignity of the United States.
And again he said: "Flat tariffs are out of date. Nations no
longer accord equal tariff treatment to all other nations, irrespective
of the treatment from them received. * * * It is very necessary
that the American government should be equipped with weapons of
negotiation adapted to modern, economic condition?."
That is a word for reciprocity treaties.
The Payne-Aldrich tariff cost the loss of the house of repre
sentatives by the republicans in 1910 and contributed # to the defeat
of the party in I°-12, but it has good elements which will be of
lasting importance to the United States, and those were the ele
ments placed therein to propitiate President Taft, the machinery
for reciprocity treaties and for the tariff board. Those constructive
measures, hidden in the mass of what proved to be destructive party
"business, political dynamite, will be matters for which President
Taft will be remembered.
He is right in his views on the necessity for elastic tariff regu
lations. All good economists can not but agree with him ; all will
agree except those protectionists who consider that American manu
factures are "infant industries"—who still picture the steel trust, for
instance, as a babe with a hidebound protection tariff as a teething
ring.
"Dollar diplomacy" is the best kind of diplomacy. Possibly it
doesn't sound nice, but how does "bullet diplomacy" sound when the
ball is crashing into the flesh, muscle and bone of a young American
soldier? The clink of coin is softer than the clash of steel—more
musical.
President Taft's administration has practiced the highest sort
of "dollar diplomacy"—a diplomacy that not only conserved and
extended the commercial importance of the United States, but in
the interest of the United States preserved peace on the American
continent. And that was in the interest of the world.
It is indeed a rare and signal honor for any woman member of
the Reno divorce colony, like Mrs. McKim-Yanderbilt. to be hon
ored by an anti-cigarette smoking society.
The Oakland park commissioners might send their "intoxicated

Consumer Is Also Vitally Interested in
The Freight Rates Hearing
CALIFORNIA industries are seriously menaced by the proposed
advance of commodity rates on 4,000 items from all points east
of the Missouri river to California terminals. At the hearing
begun on Monday before the special examiner of the interstate com
merce commission Californians representative of different industries
testified that their activities would be impaired if the advances were
permitted.
The fairness of the interstate commerce commission in the past
is sufficient to establish public confidence in its rulings, and it is not
probable that it would permit an increase in freight rates which
would do material hurt to the industries of the west and act so
directly upon increasing the cost to consumers of articles in daily use.
All freight rates are paid by the consumer, however much they
are, or whatever the competition in of their sale. For instance, if the
rate be raised on enameled cans used in the marketing of olive oil,
Jhe California oil manufacturer will put up the price of his product to
EDITORIAL PAGE OF THE CALL
cover that cost. Should that price become prohibitive he must go
out of business and the consumer would be forced to buy a foreign
oil, the price of which would be set without the check of domestic
competition.
. In every freight rate hearing the public is a party interested.
Too frequently It does not appear, and is not represented by counsel,
but its interests are at stake quite as much as those of the producer.
It behooves the California consumer to give serious consideration to
the hearing now in progress before the special examiner of the inter
state commerce commission. •

Honors Given by University to Mrs.
Hearst Were Worthy Tributes
MRS. PHOEBE APPERSON HEARST, a noble woman, was
honored on Tuesday by the recipient of part of her great
benefactions, the University of California, on the occasion of
her seventieth birthday.
Within a decade the face of the University of California has
been changed; beloved but inadequate and obsolete buildings on the
campus at Berkeley have given way to splendid structures of stone
and marble, more beautiful in their prospect than those of any uni
versity in America, possibly surpassing in sheer splendor, if not in
historic association, any university group in the world. It is due
to the generosity, to the benevolence, to the wisdom of Mrs. Hearst
that the grand scheme of university architecture was made possible.
Aside from her monumental gift of buildings and the archi
tectural plan for the university, Mrs. Hearst has given freely in other
ways. The university museum located at the Affiliated colleges in
this city, now one of the show places of the city, is largely the
result of her gift; the community life of women students at the uni
versity, Hearst hall, is the result of another gift; scholar
ships, private donations, spontaneous philanthropies, have come from
this good woman.
When the faculty and students of the University of California
gathered to do honor to Mrs. Hearst they did well. The wealth that
has been hers ha/ been given with wisdom and graciousness to the
good of the state and its most important institution.
The goose that laid the golden egg must feel chagrined when
she hears about the auriferous lay of the Petaluma hen.
It's too late now to "do your Christmas shopping early." But
you can still do it comparatively early.
Los Angeles Indifferently Decides to
Do Without New Charter
LOS ANGELES decided not to become a "new city." By a vote
of more than 2 to 1 it defeated the proposed new charter which
would have made over the city government in a radical manner,
introducing the commission system in such a way that the checks
and balances, the safeguards of American government, would vir
tually have been removed.
It is a curious commentary on the interest that Los Angeles peo
ple take in their city that less than one-third of the registered vote
of the city was cast on a matter of the most vital municipal impor
tance. The indifferent electorate must have been confident of the
defeat of the new scheme.
The commission form of government, adopted in other cities
smaller than Los Angeles, has proved itself to be a workable system,
but under the proposed Los Angeles charter more than the usual
power would have been vested in the governing commission.
The charter was the creation of the good government party of
Los Angeles, the party which has been in power for four years. The
defeat of their proposition proves that no faction can count any
longer on the blind following of its leaders. The people will think
for themselves, and decide independently of the wishes of their nom
inal chiefs and representatives.
The comic anti-free lunch ordinance was defeated nearly as
badly as the charter itseli That was a proposition to abolish free
lunches in saloons. Los Angeles has more sanity than the antics
of some of its more conspicuous factions would lead one to expect.
SIFTING THEM
Sailors
GEORGE FITCH
There are two kinds of sailors—real
sailors and book sailors. The book
sailors are by far the most attractive.
They wear wide, flowing: trousers and
queer, flat caps and sing merry songs
while they hang on the topgallant
yardarms. They will stop work at any
time to dance n hornpipe and shout
"The sailors' life is the life for me."
These sailors, like the dodo, the sea
serpent and the ornithorhyncus, are
very interesting, but they aren't co.
The real sailor is a different kind of a
bird. He is a plain man in .overalls
with a few teeth missing at rollcall
where the first mate has hit him, and
a disposition which assays 99 per cent
gloom. His hands are eaten by salt
water, there is tar in his hair and he
is against the government. He sleeps
in a bed which was made up when the
ship was built and dog biscuit would
taste like dessert to him. He has to
work very hard and has no time to im
prove his mind, because the mates are
hired for their skill In Inventing jobs
to fill his spare time. He only gets on
land once a month or-so, and when he
does he is not received by the mayor
of the city with a brass band. Nobody
gives parties to sailors home from the
sea". The most he can expect is a drink
of whisky with a knockout drop in it,
so that he can be persuaded to go back
to sea while unconscious.
The sailor is the only variety of civ
ilized man who can be kicked and
banged on the features. When con
victs are given a few discreet swats
the state conducts an investigation and
great newspapers sob all over their
editorial pages. But when a sailor is
knocked from the cathead to the bin
nacle by the first mate who needs the
exercise he only furnishes a little more
literary color for sea stories.
We are a civilized nation In many
ways and the man who kicks a dog can
not hope to be elected alderman, hut
when a sailor goes to sea the only way
he can escape is to jump overboard and
if he objects to being pounded on the
head he is sent to Jail for mutiny. If
we must have prize fighting for the
amusement of the red-white-and-blue
blooded masses, the best way to provide
entertainment would he to put a few
newly escaped seamen in an arena with
their officers and make the walls so
high that the latter couldn't jump out.
In time this would prove very dis
couraging to the latter.
IN THE EDITOR'S MAIL
Plea For the Faun
To the Editor of The Call—ln your
Issue of this date I note an article
headlined. 'Kickers Start Moral Cru
sade, Pull Down Artistic Bronze as
Indecent." After reading this article
and a few moments of thought upon the
act perpetrated by that "I am holier
than thou spirit," I feel constrained to
say that it is quite possible for too
much of a good thing to be too much
of a good thing and to ask you kindly
to grant a little space in which I may
place a few lines In defense of those
commissioners and their purpose to
replace the faun. If the "good" women
interested in this matter will stop to
think a moment they will discover that
unwittingly and unintentionally much
"prudery" has been manifested. Con
stant watchfulness, effort and profes
sion for the exhibition of virtue is not
virtue.
Venus at the fountain and the Greek
slave In the statue are* made obscene
without the artists knowledge, not from
their nakedness, but from the preten
tlon of virtue in the marked effort to
disguise. All deception is unchaste,
self-excejlence and self-righteousness
are unchaste. Any man or woman who
assumes to be chaste and earnestly
proclaims and acts against nature In Its
purity Is unwittingly in the lust of un
chaste living, for the beam is as great
in the eyes of the evil seer as the mote
in the eye of the evil doer.
Gentlemen of the board of commis
sioners, set that faun up again, and let
no "mock "modesty" rule your office or
wreck the works of art intrusted to
your care. A. W. BROWN.

HARD TIMES
By THE POET PHILOSOPHER \
Hard times will come ere very long,
some prophets do affirm; soon things
will all be going wrong, and grief
will make us squirm. The seers
may all be off their base, as they
have been before; they like to
scare the human race and make us sad
and sore. And then, again, they may
be right, their guesses may come true;
if panics put us in a plight, 'twill be a
howdydo! So let's be hoping for the
best while fixing for the worot. and do
our daily stunts with zest till our sus
penders burst. Let's put in brine the
useful scads for which we work with
haste, economize as did our dads, and
cut out foolish waste. It will not hurt
us to believe that panics will arrive;
the more of saving we achieve, the
more we all will thrive. And if the
panics do not came, but better times
instead, if things keep up their busy
hum. we'll be that much ahead. I
sometimes think when r am sane, free
from my keeper's care, a panic would
not be in vain, c'en though it brought
despair. For in these fat and golden
.years we cease to value cash; we go
in debt upto our ears for every kind of
trash. .We buy a thousand foolish
things, we are such easy marks; the
dollars that we'earn have wings and
fly to beat the larks. Perhaps we'd
learn to value wealth and try to .save
the price, if Panic came on us by
stealth, and slugged us once or twice.

Ferry Tales
HE is what they
call on the
lower coast
"a good fellow, ]
Mex." Also he is
a commuter. Fur- \
thermore he vowed ]
some weeks ago
that he was going to stop smoking.
When he walked on board the San
Francisco the other morning puffing
what Harry Bates would call "an out
door cigar with an indoor wrapper,"
somebody recalled the vow of absti
nence and asked the smoker if the habit
had proved too much for his will power
"Oh. no; nothing like\ that." replied
the man with the cigar. "I could chop
it off at once if I wanted to. I'm tiippr
ing off gradually. I believe that is the
wiser way.
"The principal reason I wanted to
stop was on account of the expense, r
found that T couldn't afford it. I
stopped. Then somebody gave mo a
cigar. When I got home that night
I had eight cigars in my pocket, all
given to me. They were all # good
cigars, and I didn't feel like giving
them away, so I changed my agree
ment with myself to this:
"I would not buy any more cigars
and wouldn't give any away, unless, of
course, they were absolutely unfit to
smoke, and a cigar has to be sonin
punk for me to pass it up. Finding
that I never returned their hospitality
my friends would gradually stop offer
ing me smokes. The chaps that sm<>k»»
good cigars would be the first to quit.
Gradually my supply would de>
in quantity and deteriorate in quality
until they became so scarce and so
rotten that I would be glad to quit.
How's that for a scheme?"
Judging from the way the peopl"
in the vicinity coughed every time the
smoke from his cigar blew their way
his scheme was working and he was
near the point where he could kiss
Lady Nicotine goodby without any re
gret.
* * •*
Talking about cigars, I met a Friit
the other day who is not going to let
the high cost of living put any dents
in his roll; at least while he retains
his ability to drive a bargain. It was
at the counter of the cigar store In
the hall of the Merchants' Kxchanp*
building. The Scot looked like »
prosperous tourist, and probably was.
He looked so prosperous that when he
asked the man behind the counter to
show him some pipes the latter placed
on a tray before him the most expensive
goods in his stock.
'\Hoot, laddie," said the Scot, "I'm no
sac eager aboot smokin' as a' that.
Twenty shlllin's mair than I care
aboot gi'en for a bit pipe."
The cigar stand man showed him
some for $2.50. It was too high.
"Have ye no eomethin' a wee l>ll
cheaper?" he inquired.
Pipes were offered him at $1, 75 cents.
50 cents, 25 cents. Hβ didn't show any
real Interest in the display until th*
cigar man threw out a handful of
pipes, with the remark:
"There's the cheapest thing I have
in the hovtte. It's a good pipe and will
cost you 10 cents." 1
The customer picked up one and ex
amined it long and carefully. If.
sounded the bowl to test its integrity
and he blew through the stem to make
sure that the air passage was clear.
"It's a fine pipe," he said finally. "I
suppose you buy them in large quan
tities?"
"How many would you want?" The
pipe dealer's interest revived.
"I Just want one, but I was thinktnV
said the Scot, "that In handlin' bo many
ye might ha one that's a wee bit dam
aged that yell sell me for a nickel."'

There was a story In this column
a week or so ago about Joe Robinson
and four other Marln county com
muters who come to the city on an
early boat and have won the golden
opinions of their neighbors through
their refusal to permti their wives to
get up in the dark and prepare break
fast at home before they start. They
eat their morning meal on the ferry
boat. Mention was made of the fa* t ,*
that Robinson was an expert at mak- <
ing rum omelets, and that this warm
and cheering dish was not infrequently
the piece de resistance at these very
a. m. feasts.
That story caused quite a stir. Tim
wives of other and less considerate
husbands read it. and, I am told, that
the Northwestern Pacific is havi
trouble to accommodate commuter* at
breakfast on the early morning boats.
The reports may have been exag
gerated a little. Reports of things that
happen so early in the morning usually
are. I do know this, however, that
since that ferry tale appeared Charles
R. Gagan, Harry Stratford and Frank
Nugent have Joined the Robinson
