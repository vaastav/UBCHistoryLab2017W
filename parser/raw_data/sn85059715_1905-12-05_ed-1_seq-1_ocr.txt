Washington, D. C-, Pec. 5?
President Roosevelt's annual message
to the Fifty-ninth Congress
BpS was received by both branches of
pr that body shortly after Congress
' _ convened at noon today, and was
read in both the House and Senate.
'i..':- '? Tf IB (IB fnllniiTJ
% - *' To the Senate and House of licpreg/'r
scntaiirTs :
The people of tliis country continne
to enjoy great prosperity.
Undoubtedly there will be ebb and
flow in such prosperity, and this ebb
/ ?v. and flow will be felt more or less by
all members of the community, both
by the deserving and the undeserving.
Against the wrath of the T?rd|
the wisdom of man can not .avail;
in times of flood or drought human
ingenuity can liut partially repair
the disaster. A general failure ofj
crops would hurt all of us. Again
if the folly of man mars the general
well-being, then! those who are in-j
nocent of the folly will have to pay
part of the penalty incurred by those
who are guilty of the folly. A panic
brought on by the speculative folly
of part of the business community
would hurt the whole business community.
But such stoppage of welfare,
though it might be severe
would not be lasting. Tn the long
run the one vital factor in the permanent
prosperity of the country is
s the high individual character of the
average American worker ,the average
American citizen, no matter
-whether his work be mental or~t?anual,
wliether he be farmer or wageworker,
business man or professional
man.
Tn our industrial and social system
the interests of all men are so
eloselv intertwined that in the immense
majority of eases a straight,
dealing man who by his efficiency
j> by his ingenuity and industry, benefits
himself must also benefit others
B?;P ? "Normally the man of great productive
cnpaeity who becomes rich by
guiding the labor of many other men
Sr?'t ' does so bv enabling them to produce
Stfe jf iftorc than they could produce witn! out
his gafdance; and both he and
" they shnre in the benefit, which
jjg;'. ' comes also to- the public at large,
fcs'v _Thc superficial fact that the sharing
" may be unequal must never blind
& las to the underlying fact that there
is this slinring, and that the benefit
jpyVi comes in some degree to euch man
concerned. NormaHy the wngeSpa:';
worker, the man of small means,
and the average consumer, as well as
. the avesnge producer, are all alike
fe; helped by making conditions such
JSfei that the man of exceptional business
- * 'is# _ ability receives nn exceptional reward
for his ability. Something
can he 11 one by legislation to help
tbc general prosperity: but 110 such
help of a permanently beneficial
character enn be given to the less
able and less fortunate, save as the
results of a policy which shall inure
to the^ advantage of all industrious
and omcieni pyojiu.* fflB am
and this is only another way of saying
that any benefit which comes
from the less fortunate must of
necessity conic even more to the
more able and more fortunate. If
; . therefore, the less fortunate man is
moved by envy of his more fortunate
flB&g*.' brother to strike at the conditions
jmfgijjpS* . undef which tlicy have both, though
untf|uallyT prospered, the result will
pSfe^ assuredly be that while damajfe may
come to the one struck at, it will
visit with an even heavier load the
one who strikes the blow. Taken as
HbSSv! a whole we must all go up or go
- down together.
CORPORATIONS
Yet, while not merely Admitting
but insisting upon this, it is also
tmc that where there is no govern?
mental restraint or supervision some
of the" exceptional men use their
energies not in ways that nre for the
pSPP';. common good, but in ways which
'?. i tell against this common good. The
nrtunes amassed through corporate
IS^mHjPll'Stgsaxization are now so lnrge, and
vest such power in those that wield
l&i . . them, as to make it a matter of
necessity to give to the severeign?
that is, to the Government-'which

OE8ULATION
mm
AGAINST HAR1
Frederick W. Word, of Pittsburg
through his attorneys, V. B. Archer
of Parkersburg, and F. C. Piper, oi
Ruckhannon, have filed a bill ir
equity in the U. S. Circuit Couri
igninst John B. HarOgt al., for tin
purpose of obtaining a specific performance
of a contract dated Nov
4, 1904, by which Hart, trustee,
agreed to sell and convey to the
plaintiffs, 14,600 acres of timber
anil coal land, together with the
cnpital stock of the Alexander and
Rich Mountain Railway Co., in consideration
of $250,000 cash.
The bill alleges that after the contract
was made, in abstracting
titles, it was found that they wefe
defective in many points, and that
Hart did not have any title to 1,000
acres in Randolph county included
in the contract of sale, which the
plaintiff values at $3,000.
Plaintiff also charges that after
the date of contract, Hart, trustee,
has endeavored to avoid the effect of
his agreement and has procured,
without the knowledge of the plain
tilt a decree for the sale of thxs property
in the circuit court of Upshur
county by G. M. Fleming, U. G.
Young and J. W. Davis, special commissioners.
These commissioners caused the
whole tract of land "'to be advertised
for sale, as well as all the property
of the railroad company, which sale
was to take place Tuesday, December
5. at Buckhannon.
Judge Dayton entered a decree,
enjoining the sale.
This is the same property that
formerly belonged to the Randolph
Coal and Lumber Company.

Blue and the Gray Tuesday here. I
when Captain. James H. Hurry, of
Bridgeport, and W. S. Sinsel, of C
Central City, Xeb., met. They had
not seen one another for 42 years, J
and the last time they met was under
circumstances that formed a I
basis for reminiscent conversation,
when they greeted one another Tues- C
day. In 18(>3, during the Civil war,
when Jones* raid came through this
section, Captain Ilurrv was a detailed
scout of the raid on the Con- I
federate side and captured Mr. Sinsel,
foreman of a bridge gang work- .1

"Tlie Parvenus," a new and
original musical comedy was produced
for the first time at the Grand
Opera House Monday night by a
cast and chorus selected from the
best available musical talent :'n tb

:ornfortably tilled with the most
epresentative audience of Clarks>urg's
social circles that has been
eon in the opera house in mam

Pecuniarily the play was a great
uccqss, and the proceeds will go to
well the hank account of the M:rr ato
