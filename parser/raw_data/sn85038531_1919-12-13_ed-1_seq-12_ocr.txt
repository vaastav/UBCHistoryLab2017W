Billy Mink Finds Some Queer
. Fences.
(BY THORNTON W. BURGESS.)
(Copyright, 1919, by T. W. Burg-ess.)
The trouble with a great many
people is that they are heedless.
When they find something new and
strange they forget everything but
their curiosity. Because of this they
walk right straight into trouble. It
happens over and over again
But Billy Mink isn't thia kind of a
person. My, my, I should say notl
He never has been. If he had he
wOfild have lost that beautiful brown
coat of his long ago, and there
would be no Billy Mink. Billy has
his share of curiosity, but with it he
possesses a great, big bump of sus
picion. When he finds anything new
and strange he wants to learn all
about it. But right away he is sus
picious of It.
After he had discovered the trap
set for him at the entrance to one
of his favorite holes in the Laughing
Brook and had fooled the trapper by
getting the fish the trapper had
rleced In that hole, Billy went on up
the Laughing Brook to see what else
he could discover. Not very far above
that place there was a steep bank
on each side of the Laughing Brook.
Along the foot of each bank wa a
narrow strip of level ground between
the bank and the water. You see,
at this season of the year the water
In the Laughing Brook was low.
When Billy came to this place he
discovered something queer. It was
a little fence. It ran from the foot
of the bank straight out into the
Laughing Brook to where the water
becamu deep. Midway in this little
fence was a gateway JuBt big enough
to slip through comfortably. Billy
looked across to the other side of the
Laughing Brook. Over there waa an
other little fence Just like this one
and that little fence had an. opening
in it.
"Huh!" said Billy. "Huh! Those

fences are something new. They
were not here when I came down the
Laughing Brook yesterday. I won
der what they are for. If it were
not for those two little openings I
would ha- e to either climb the bank
or swim around the ends of those
fences, and that would be bother
some. I can . go through that little
opening there as easy as rolling off
a log, but I'm not going to do it Nd,
sir, I'm not going to do It. There is
something wrong about those fences.
They look to me as If they had been
built Just to make me go through
one of those little gateways. . If that's
the case, I'm not going to do It."
So Billy plunged into the Laughing
Brook and swam out In the deep
water around the end of the little
fence. Then very carefully he ap
proached the little opening from that
side. The more he looked at it, the
less he liked it. Right in the middle
of that little opening were some wet,
dead leaves. "Ha, ha!" said Billy,
"Another trap!"

NEARING BREAK
WITH MEXICO
Wilson Seriously Considering
Withdrawing Recognition
of Carranza.
(BY DAVID LAWRENCE.)
Washington, Dee. 13. (Copyrighted
for The Chattanooga News.) Now
that the little flurry between the
executive and legislative branches of
the government as to the handling
of affairs with Mexico haa passed,
and both sides are agreed that
President Wilson shall have the sole
power to say whether recognition
shall be withdrawn from the Car
ransa government, the true friends
of Mexico in the United States are
beginning to fear that euch a step
will be taken.
The fact is that serious consider
ation is being given by the president
to the argument being presented to
him In favor of a withdrawal of rec
ognition. It is regrettable that mat
ters have come to such a pass for it
had been hoped by the friends of
Mexico that the Carranza govern
ment would be able to weather the
storm of criticism and proceed with
its work of reconstruction in rebellion-torn
Mexico.
But the record of the Carranza gov
ernment which is now being ex
amined at the White House, covering
the relations of the two governments
since recognition was extended in
October, 1915, Is such that friends of
Mexico , here have become discour
aged and downcast.
The grievances may be divided
Into three classes: Those affecting
the lives of foreigners, those affect
ing the property rights of Americans
and those which may bo described
as plain irritation over the manner
In which the department of state feel
that its notes have been treated and
its representations Ignored.
Ambassador Henry P. Fletcher,
who has been given a free hand in
dealing with the Carranza govern
ment, has reported on every occasion
the difficulty he has had in making
the Mexican government understand
that a friendly disposition toward the
United States and a willingness to
unbend would aid materially in a
friendly solution of controversy
between the two countries. But even
Ambassador Fletcher's efforts have
been in vain, and now the president
Is confronted with the task of ans
wering this question:
Has the Carranza government ful
filled the promises It gave when rec
ognition was extended?
It is being urged that Inasmuch as
Mexico has enacted retroactive legis
lation affecting American oil proper
ties, the recognition may be looked
at from a retroactive point of view
and withdrawn.
The department of state has com
piled a list of Americans killed in
Mexico during the period of the Car
ranza administration. It has made
up also a case showing that the
rights of American property owners,
particularly the oil companies, have
not only been taken away, but that
discrimination in favor of the oil in
terests of other countries and against
those of the United States have been
practiced. Here, however, are the
explicit and implicit promises made
by the Carranza government which
are being examined to determine
whether recognition which was given
upon the fulfillment of certain con
ditions and obligations now shall be
withdrawn.
June 11. 1915 Carranza's procla
mation: "First, the constitutionalist
government shall afford to foreigners
resident In Mexico all guarantees to
which they are entitled, and shall
amply protect their lives, their free
dom and the enjoyment of their
rights of property." .
Oct. 7, 1915 Note from Ambassa
dor Designate Arredondo to Robert
Lansing, secretary of state, giving
the following assurance: "The gov
ernment he (Venustiano Carranza)
represents, in its capacity of political
entity, conscious of its international
obligations, has afforded guarantees
to the nationals and haa done like
wise to foreigners and shall continue
to see that their lives anfl property
are respected in accordance with the
practices established by civilized na
tions." Oct 19, 1915 De facto recognition
based on above, among other assur
ances. Is conceded to the Carranza
constitutionalist faction by the
United States government
January, 1916 State department
protests to Carranza government
through Sllllman against confiscation
of oil rights. Mexico gives assurance

who stated she was also deeply im
pressed with the great evangelist, it
was the first sermon of Mr. Sunday's
that Mrs. Webb had heard.
Another guest of the press box of
last night's sermon was A. Bagley, a
prominent and leading citizen of
Fayettevllle. Mr. Bagley came to
Chattanooga to hear Mr. Sunday,
and following the sermon, said: "lie
Is the greatest man I ever hearv', and
Is truly a religious man, preaching
the gospel of Jesus Christ. He is to
day the greatest influence for
good in the country, and I pray God
that his life will be spared many more
years to follow his great and mag
nificent calling."

Q. Why did President Wilson omit
any reference to the peace treaty from
his message delivered at the opening
of congress? T. D.
A The president's message at tha
opening of congress is always addressed
to both houses. The consideration of
the peace treaty is a matter In which
the senate alone has a voice. It ob
viously would have been improper to
Include In a message to both houses a
matter which concerns only the senate.
, Q. How long would it take to count
a oimon: n,. v.
A. If a person were able to oeont
at the rate of 200 a minute, and worked
without intermission twelve hours a
day, it would take him nineteen years
and nine days to count a billion.
Q.- Of the total number of Ameri
cans killed in battle during the world
war, what percentage belonged to the
infantry? F. V.
A. According to a recent report
made to congress, 89 per cent, of the
50,000 or more battle deaths suffered
by the American Army were infantry
men. The remaining 11 per cent, may
be distributed among the other 11
branches of the service. The losses of
the infantry were eighteen and eight
tenths times greater than the field ar
tillery. Q. What Is the average weight of
the human beings in the world today?
W. V. T.
A. If all the men, women and chil
dren black, white, yellow, brown or
red, in all parts of the world, could be
weighed and the average struck, that
average would be a little less than 100
pounds avoirdupois. Six-pound infants
and 600-pound giants contribute to this
average.
Q. What Is the total amount of In
surance Issued by the war risk bureau?
F. R. L.
A. Government Insurance, amount
ing to J39.817.391. 500, was issued up to

much insurance as that written by all
the private companies combined.

by automobile accidents in 1918? M.
B. D.
A. The latest statistics show that
6,677 deaths were caused by automobile

English nurse who was executed by the
Germans, been transferred from the

buried Immediately after her execu
tion? C. M.
A. Her body has been transferred to
Westminster Abbey, where an impres
sive ceremony was held.
Q. Which birds have the longest and
shortest lives? R. A.
A. The crow, eagle, raven and swan
the the longest lived birds. hTeir av

life of three years. Other short-lived
