The following is a synopsis 'Of- President
McKinley's message:
The massage ope'ris with a touching' tri
bute to the memory of the la(te Vies
President Hobart.
The fifty-sixth congriss convenes, says
the president, in its first regular session
with the country ill a condition of unus
ual prosperity, of universal good .y, ill
among the people at home, and in rela
tions of peace aniT friendship with' every
government of the world.
Our, foreign commerce has shown great
Increase in volume ahd value.' The com.
bined imports and exports for the year
are the largest ever show by a 'Single
year in all our history.
Referring to the government finances,
the president says that the receipts from
all sources for the fiscal year ended J.une
30, lS'.litT aggregated $Ul»,'.tS2,li04. S5. For
the fiscal year the expenditures were
$700,093,504.02, leaving a deficit of !?SQ,111,
559.t.!7.
The secretary of the treasury, estimates
that the receipts for the current fiscal
year will aggregate !?i!-10,0."iS.l!i|, and upon
the basis of present approuriaiions a sur-.
plus of $040,000,000.
The present gratifying strength of the
treasury -is shown by the fact that on
Dec. 1, 1899, the available cash balance
was •?2'iS,004,Sct7.'721 of .which: S23'd,744,
1)05.36 was in gold coin ahd bullion." The
conditions of confidence which prevail
throughout the country have .brought gold
into more general use. and customs re
ceipts are' now almost entirely- paid in
that coin.
The. president directs the attention of
congress to the necessity of reforms in
the" National 'banking act. and expresses
the hope that reasonable modifications
be made in the act to males its service
more responsive to the people's need?.
He says:
"I urgently recommend that to sup
port the existing gold standard, and to
maintain 'the parity in value of the coins
of the two metals (gold and silver):and
the equal power of every dollar at-, all
tines in the market, and in the payment
of debts,' the secretary
•"'•''^'vV'-—•''

(api
the treasury
be given additional power and charged
with the duty to sell United States boi:ds
and to employ such other effective means
as may be necessary to these ends."
In summing up tire financial section 'ot
his message, the president says:
"Our receipts now equal our expendi
tures deficit revenues no longer create
alarm. Let us remove the only remain
ing cause by conferring the full and nec
essary power on the secretary of- the
treasury and impose nn him the duty to
uphold the present gold standard 'and
preserve the coi.-.s of the two metals on a
parity with each other, which is the re
peatedly declared policy of the United
States.
In this connection I repeat my former
recommendations that a portion of the
gold holdings shall be placed in a trust
fund, from which greenbacks s'hall be re
deemed upon presentation but when
once redeemed shall not thereafter be
paid out except for gold."
The attention of congress, is called to
to the value of an American merchant
marine Tor the extension -.vf our commer
cial trade and the str u:.- hening 'of our
power upon the -sc-a, and immediate ac
tion is urged.
On the subject of trusts the president
says:
Combinations of capital organized into
trusts to control the conditions of trade
among our citizens, to stifle competition,
limit production and determine the prices
of products used and consumed by the
people, are justly provoking public dis
cussion, and should early claim the at
tention of the congress.
It is universally conceded that combi
nations which engross or control the mar
ket of any particular kind of merchandise
or commodity necessary to the general
community, by suppressing natural and
ordinary competition, who-'sby prices are
unduly enhanced to the general consum
er, are obnoxious not only t.o the common
law but also.to the public welfare. There
must be a remedy l'or Lhu evils involved
In such organizations.
If t"he present law can be extended
more c-rtainly to control or- check these
monopolies or trust, it should be dona
without delay. Whatever power the con
gress possesses over this most important
subject should be promptly ascertained
and asserted.
It is apparent that uniformity of legis
lation upon this subject in the several
(states is much to be desired. It is to be
hoped that such unifumiitv founded on a
wise and just discrimination between
what is injurious and what is useful and
riscesssry in business operations may bo
obtained, and that means may be found
for the congress within the limitations of
Its constitutional power so to supplement
an^ effective code of state legislation as
to make a complete system of laws
throughout the United States adequate
•to compel .a general observance of the
salutary rules.
A review of our relations with foreign
fitates is presented, with such recom
mendations as are deemed appropriate.
Our relations with otl nations are on
most friendly terms.
The president again refer* to the. nec
essity for the construction of the Nicara
gua canal and urges congress to ta!«
early action in the matter.
or the dispute regarding the Alaskan
Boundary, the president says a modus
Vivendi for provisional demarcations in
the region about the head of the Lynn
canal has been agreed upon and express
es the hope that negotiations now pend
ing will end in an early and amicablo
adjustment.
With regard, to the Brftish-Roer war,
the president says this government haii
maintained an attitude Of^heutrallty.
The president refers to the lynching of
foreigners In Louisiana, and says the
federal courts should be given jurisdic
tion in such cases.
The president urges tiie necessity of a
cable to Manila, and invites congress to
give the matter consideration.

have also been concluded with France
.nn with the Arg-entirio republic.
Of the work of the: peace conference
.the president says:
The final act of the conference include*
conventions- upon the. amelioration of the
laws and customs of war on land, tho
adaptation to maritime 'warfare of the
principles of. the Geneva convention of
1S03, and the extension of judicial met'o
ods to international cases. The conven
tion for the pacific settlement of interna
tional conflicts embodies the fending
features of the A"mericant plaiK.wytJv.such
modifications as were rendered necessary
by the great diversity of views and inter
ests represented by the delegates. Tiie
four titles of tho convention provide for
the maintenance of general peace: the
exercise of good 'offices and mediation
tho formation of committees of inquirv
and international arbitration.
The mediation provided for by.the con
vention is purely voluntary "and advisory
®nd is intended to avoid any invasion or
limitation of the sovereign rights of the
adhering--state®. The commissions of in
quiry proposed consist of delegations to
bo specifically constituted for particular
purposes hv means of conventions be
tween the-contesting parties', having-for
their object the clear understanding of
international differences before resorting
to fJie. use of force. T-heprovision for ar
bitration contemplates the formation of
a permanent tribunal before which dis
puted, cases may be brought for settle
ment by the mutual consent of the liti
gants in each case.
Tho president speaks in terms of the
highest praises of the Work of the volim
r-rgulars engaged in war in the
Philippines, and recommends that con
gress g-rant a -medal of honor to those
who voluntarily remained in the service.
Tho operations of- the army are fully
presented in the report of the secretary of
war. I cannot withhold from officers "and
men, the highest, commendation for their
soldierly conduct in trying situations,
their willing sacrifice^ for iheir counb-v
and the 'integrity and ability with v-hio-ii
iey have performed unmiml and difficult
duties in our island possessions.
The president-says tlie'naw has main-'
tained the spirit and high efficiency, which
.iave always characterized that service,
and has lost none of the gallantry in
heroic notion which has signalized its
brilliant and glorious past. The nation
lias equal pride in its earl and later
achievements. Tts habitual readiness for
every emergency has won the confidence
and admiration of the .country. The peo
ple are interested in the preparation and
prestige of he navy and will iustifv lib

and improvement.'

On tho lutli of Deeem-jt-r, ]S9S, the
treaty of peace between the United States
and Spain w.i:, .signe-l. Tt provided, among
other^ things, that Spain -bould cede to
the United States the archipelago known
as the Philippine islands: that the United
States should pay to Spain the sum of
$20,000,000, and that the civil rights and
the population of the native inhabitants
of the territories thus ceded to the United I
States should be determined by the con
gress. The treaty was ratified by the
senate on the Tth of February. 1809, and
by the government of Spain on the 19th
of March following. The ratifications
were exchanged on the 11th of April and
the treaty publicly proclaimed. On the
2d of March the congress voted the sum
contemplated by the treatv and the
amount was paid over to the Spanish gov
ernment on the first of May.
In this manner 1 lie Philippines came to
the United SLates. The islands were eeded
by 'he government ..f Spain, which had
been in the undis:,.ue,| possession of
them for centuries.

had every reason to believe, and I sMi]
believe, that this transfer of sovereignty
was in accordance with' the wishes and
'be aspirations of the great mass of the
Filipino people. From th'» earliest mo

the people of the island of our ardent de
sire for their welfare and of the intenHoii
of this government to do everything pos
Bible to advance their interests In my
order of tho 19th of May. 189.«, the com
mander of the military expedition dis
patched to the Philippines was instructed
to declare that wc came not to make war
upon the people of that country "nor
upon any party or faction among them
but to protect them in their homes, in
'heir employments and in their personal
and religious rights." That there should

But before their arrival at Manila, the
sinster ambition of a few leaders of the
Filippinos had created a situation full of
embarrassments for us and -most: grievous
in its consequences to themselves. The
clear and impartial preliminary report of
tho commissioners, which I transmit
herewith, gives lucid and comprehen
sive a history of the present insurrection
ary movement that the story need not be
here repeated.
It is enough to say that the claim of
the rebel leader that he Was promised
independence by any officer of the United
States in relation for.his assistance has
no foundation in fact and is categorically
denied by the very witnesses who were
called to prove it.
The most, the -insurgent leader hoped
for when he came back to Manila was
the liberation of the islands tr'om the
Spanish control, which they had been
laboring for years without success to
throw off. The prompt accomplishment
of this work by the American army aiid
navy gave him other ideas, arjd ambitions
and insidious suggestions, from various
quarters perverted the pu poses ayd in
tentions with which lie hadtaken up
arms.
The rebellion must be put down, civil
government, cannot be thorougly .estab
lished until order is restored'.'
With a devotion: arjd gallantry worthy
of its most brilliant history, the army,
ably and loyally assisted by.. the .nay.y,
has carried on this unwelcome" but most
righteous campaign, which- richly de
served success^. The noble self-sacrific
with which our soldiers and" sailors-whose
terms of service had expired refused to
avail themselves of their right to return
home as long as they were, needed at. the
front forms one of the brightest pages in I
our annals. Although their operations
have been somewhat interrupted and
checked by a rainy, season of unusual
violence and duration, they liaVe- gained
ground steadily 'in every direction ahd
now look'forward confidently to a speedy
completion of their task.
The unfavorable circumstances con
nected with an active campaign have not
been permitted to interfere with theequal
ly important work of reconstruction.

of peace and order and the inauguration
of self-governing municipal life in many
portions of the archipelago. A notable
beginning has been made in the establish
ment of a government in the island of
Negros, which is deserving of special con
sideration. This was the first island- "to
accept American -sovereignty. Its people
unreservedly proclaimed allegiance to the
United States and adopted a constitution
looking to the establishment of a popular
government.
The authorities of the Sulu islands ha.ve
accepted the succession of the Un id
States to the rights of Spain, and our flag
floats over that territory.-
Concerning the, future government of
the archipelago the president says:
The future government of the Philip
pines rests with the congress of the
United States. Few graver responsibili
ties have ever been confided to us. If
we accept them in a spirit worthy of
our race and our' traditions, a great op
portunity comes with them.
Tho islands lie under the shelter of
our flag. They are ours by every title
of law and equity. They cannot be
abandoned. If we desert them we leave
them at once to anarchy and finally to
barbarism. We fling them, a golden apple
of discord, among the rival powers, no
one of which could permit another to
seize them unquestioned.
Their rich plains and valleys would be
the scene of endless strife and bloodshed.
The advent of Dewey's fleet in Manila
bay, instead of being, as we hq-ped, the
down of a new day of freedom and pro
gress, will have been the beginning of
an era of misery and violence worse than
any which has darkened their unhappy
past. The suggestion has been made that
we ci uId renounce our authority over the
island.
This proposition will riot be found, I
am sure, worthy of your serious atten
tion. Such an arrangement would involve
at the ouset a cruel breach of faith.
It would, take the pcacable and loyal
majority who ask nothing better than to
accept our authority at the mercy of the
minority of armed insurgents. It would
make us responsible for the acts of the
insurgent leaders, and give us no power
with the task of protecting them against
each other and defending them against
any foreign powei^ith which they chose
to quarrel. In sho^ it would take from
the congress of the United States the
power of declaring war and vest that tre
mendous prerogative in tha legal leader
of the hour.
It does not seem desirable that I should
recommend at this time a specific and
final form of government Cor these is

will be the duty of congress to construct

By "the "resolution of annexation tha
president was directed to, appoint five
commissioners to recommend to congress
such legislation concerning the islands as
they should deem necessary or proper.
These commissioners were duly appointed
and after a careful investigation and
study of the systpm of'laws and govern
ment prevailing in the islands and of the
conditions existing there they prepared
a bill to provide a government under the
titlejofithe 'Territory of Hawaii." The
report of the committee wdth the bill
wIlich
they prepared, was transmitted by
me to congress on Dec. 6, 1S9S, but the
bill still awaits final action.
The people:of 'hese islands are entitled

stitution, but in the absence of any act of
congress providing for federal courts in
the island and for a. procedure by which

they are powerless to -secure their en

and other proper officers and methods of
procedure in appellate proceedings, and
that the government of this newly ac

teach me the value of the cards, when
the police broke in and made a clean
sweep of everybody. Next morning,
when arraigned at the police court, I
wanted a lawyer, and there was a gen

"I don't know where you will get
