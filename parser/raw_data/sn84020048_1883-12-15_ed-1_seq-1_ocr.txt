THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
In to-dav'i supplement we print
the President's menage in full. In
it the President treats of interna
tional mat tern, interstate affaire,
the necessity of protecting the for
es'., the Cotton Centennial Exposi
tion, Federal protection for the peo
ple, government eontrol of tho tel
egraph, foreign discrimination
gainst our commerce, internal im
provements, the necessity for war
defences, national banks and the I
currency, the silver currency, the
ational debt, customs and reve
ues, the Mormons, etc. In sum
ming up the points of the message,
the Memphis Appeal thinks there
much in it "that not only the
Democratic but the Republican
part j will dissont from. Indeed,
he bill introduced in the Senate by-
Senaior Edmunds, providing fir
the construction of four postal tel
egraph lines, is in the very teeth of
'resident Arthur's expressed oppo-
linn to postal telegraphy, and this,
o doulit will have the consent of a
majority ot the members of both
houses. What Mr. Arthur ears
boat the regulation by Congress
f the inter-state traffic by railroads
will command attention as a tribute
o the sagacity of Mr. Reagan, ot
exas, who for years has prassed
his matter upon the consideration
fOongresa with the aid of the
Democratic members of both hom
es, lite radical measure t lie presi-
dent suggests for the extirpation
nd suppression of polygamy will
halleiige the attention as really
he only means left the government j
o aeeoinplish that purpose, and
that, will do il."
In the message the President
knows no North, no South. This is
most commeudab.e. He is oppos
ed to the too' rapid extinction of the
national debt by excessive taxation.
ile approves .the reduction iu in-
ernal revenue taxes made by the
ast Congress, anl thinks that a
still greaier reduction should be
made in these taxes. In reference
lo the tan IT, he holds ' that the re
sults ot the legislation of the last
session of Congress" have not be
come sufficiently apparent to justi
fy any radical revision or sweeping
nediScalion ot existing laws."

HON. JOHN Y. MUUKY OF TIPPAH.
This gentleman, with some me in
bers of his family, attended the
Methodist conference at this place,
and were guests of Hon. C. D. How
ry, during their Stay. Among the
lay delegates to tho conference, no
one in attendance proved more use
ful than this gentleman. Dr. Mur-
ry is being mentioned quits fre
quently by tho State press as a most
available man (or Speaker of the
next House of Representatives.
Should the choice fall upon him the
people of Mississippi will have no
occasion to regret the selection.
He if said to be a fine parliamenta
nan. a aignineu, courteous gentle
man, a man of fine sense and largx
experience in publio affairs. Dr.
Murry has a large circle ot frieuds
all over the State who wonld be
pleased to see hlra sleeted Speaker,

PEOPLE WILL TALK.
Yeu may get through the world,
bat 'twill be very slow,
If you listen to all that is said as
you go;
You'll be worried and fretted
kept in a stew
For meddlesome tongues
have something to do,
And people will talk
and
must
jlf quiet and modest you'll have it
presumed
That your humble position is only
assumed
You're a wolf in sheep's clothing,
or else you're a fool;
But don't get exeited keep per
fectly cool
For people will talk.
And then if you show the leajt
boldness of heart,
Or a slight inclination to take your
own part.
They will call yon an upstart, con
ceited and vain,
Dut keep straight ahead don't s'x)j)
to explain
For people will talk.
If threadbare your dress, or old
fat-uioueil your hat,
Some one will surely take notice to
that,
And hint rather strong that you
can't pay your way;
But don't get excited whatever
they say
For people will talk.
If jour dress is the fashion, don't
think lo escaofc.
Fof lev tllarn in a diffjr.
ent ehape;
You're ahead ol your means, or your
tailor's unpaid;
But mind your o wu business, there's
naught to be made, '
For people will talk. '
Now, the best wjy to do is to do as
you please, .
For your mind, if you have one,
will then be at esse;
Of course you will meet with all
sorts of abuse;
But don't think lo stop them il
aiut any use
For people will talk.
