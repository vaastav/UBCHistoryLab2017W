The message to Congress by the
President is viewed with alarm by no
class of producers to the revenue of the
country mora than by the wool growers
At them and their valuable industry
it strikes a fatal blow if carried out
Meetings have already been held in
several of the prsncipal cities of the
Union and measures are being taken
to present a bill to the present Con
gress in order that they may be pro
tected in their sights and for the res
toration of the tariff on wool or at least
to preventany further reduction of the
existing tarifi
The national wool growers associa
tion at their session in Washington
representing a capital of over 0500000
000 and a constituency of 1000000
wool growers and dealers declare that
tlio message of tho President is a direct
attack upon their iudustry one of th
most important in the country That
the argument made by tho Presi
dent for the removal of their protection
against foreign competition is the old
one repeatedly made by the enemies of
their industrial progress and effectively
answered in nearly every school district
of our landand so thoroughly disproved
by logic of facts and demonstration of
experience and history as to need no
answer from them They acknowledge
that their small holdings their scat
tered and unorganized condition make
them tho easy proy of the free trader
but they had a right to expect some
thing different from tho Chief Execu
tive of the nation at once tho most
happy prosprrous and contented of
any in the world made so by the poli
cy of protection and development which
he now seeks to destroy They conclu
de by saying We liad a right to ex
pect our President would favor the
wool growers of the United States and
confess our deep disappointment that
instead he favors the interests of our
foreign competitors
A largo number of prominent wool
growers met at tho office of Christy
Wise in San Francisco and endorsed
tho resolutions of the National Wool
growers Association condemning the
Presidents message to Congress A re
duction in the tariff on wool would
woik an incalcuable injury and loss to
one of tho leading industries of a large
number of States and Territories and
particularly would it bo felt by the
wool growers and sheop owners of Ari
zona California and New Mexico
No reliable figures showing the value
pf the wool crop hwt year have been
given to the public but tho production
in pounds is estimated at 258000000
which at an average rate of 35c a
pound was worth about 899760000
It appears to bo tho policy of the
present administration to put imports
of wool on the freo list This purpose
clearly shown in tho message of the
President the report of the secretary
of the treasury and addresses and
newspaper talks rnado by prominent
free traders The abolition of the duty
on wool will be ono of tho leading pro
visions in tho tariff reduction bill to be
prepared by tho Ways and Means
Committee of tho Houso of Represen
tativ33 Tho passago of an act with
that clause would instantly and mater
ially reduce the value of every sheep
owned in tho country Tho duty on the
foreign wool which comes into direct
competition with tho American product
viverages approximately about 60 per
cent on its price In 1883 there was a
reduction made in the duties
on wool and tho effect of
this was to bring down tho number of
sheep in the country from 50026626
in the latter part of 1883 when the ef
fect of tho act began to be felt to 44
759314 at the beginning of tho present
year
We do not believe that member of
Congress from any of tho states or ter
ritories which are interested in wool
production will vote for a measure
which will confisicatethe property of a
largo and influential portion of lieir
constituents and cripple one of the
most important industries of the United
States But wo are of the opinion that
our sonatora and Representatives will
oppn any such scheme as favors
foreign competition as against
our own worxing men with all the
earnestness and vigor which they can
command
Tub National Republican conven
tion will be held in Chicago on Juno
19th 1888
Ir in wisdoms ways you wish to
walk five tilings observe with care of
whom you speak to whom you speak
and how and when and where
Commnndor in chief J P Roa of
the Q A IV has fixed tho date for
holding tho next Grand encampment
at Columbus on the second Tuesday
in next September
The wool growers of the United
States are vigorously protesting against
the recomondation of President
Cleveland to Congress for a reduction
on tho present wool tariff
Tubus are three sorts of prasie that
which we yield lend and pay We
yield to the powerful from fear wo
lend to the weak from interest we pay
it to the deserving from gratitude
Tub wool growers and wool dealers
of the country will have another con
ference in Washington on January 11
We trust that Arizona will be well
represented at that gathering by some
of our leading sheep men as matter
of vital importance to them will be
discussed
Tns sheep interests of the United
States in session at Washington fur
nishes figures to show that undsr tho
reduced wool tariff tho revenues from
that source grew from 81700000 to
5000000 and that tho sheep indus
try lost nearly 6000000 sheep
thereby
These were none of the Chicago
Anarchists who uttered more atrocious
sentiments than did Herr Most in
New York Had he made the same
declaration in Chicago at the time of
the murders committed there ho would
have been hung with the other Anar
chists Most ha3 served one term in
the Penitentiary on Blackwells Island
He recently boasted that tho only
flag he and his associates acknowledge
was the red flag Tho flag of the United
States had no significance for him But
after all it means something when
Most gets into prison It means order
law protection atid the punishment of
heinous crimes Herr Mosts speeches
in New York tended directly to mob
violence and murder Fortunately this
extreme result was not reached and
Most instead of a conviction of
the crime of murder is only convicted
of a misdemeanor which sends him to
Clackwells Island for another term

Many enquiries are being made by
citizens of Flagstaff and Williams to
know whether or not the County
Treasurer has a list of names of those
persons who paid poll tax to the As
sessor when he was on his official tour
We understand that the question is
asked for the reason that several have
had an invitation to pay the poll tax
the second time from the County
Treasurer In fact we ourselves have
been called upon to pay it again from
the Treasurer under the date of Dec
15th Explanatiois are in order

as a warning When you in
