Washington, Dec. 5.—Tho annual
message of President McKinley
read in both houses of Congress today.
The full text of the dooument is as
follows :
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives:
Notwithstanding the added burdens
rendered necessary by the
people rejoice in a very satisfactory
d steadily increasing degree of pros
perity evidenced by the largest
of business ever recorded. Manufacture
has been productive, agricultural pur
suits have yielded abundant returns,
labor in all fields of industry is better
rewarded, revenue legislation passed
by the present Congress has increas'd
the treasury's receipts to the amount
estimated by its authors; the finances
of the government have been success
fully administered and its credit ad
vanced to the first rank ; while its
rency has been maintained at tho
world's highest standard. Military
service under a common flag and for
a righteous cause has strengthened tho
national spirit and served to cement
closely than
bonds between every sootion of the
country.
A review of the rolatiou of the
United States to othor powers, always
appropriate, is this year of primary
importance in view of the momentous
issues which have arisen, demanding
in one instance the ultimate determi
nation by arms and involving far
reaching consequenoes which will re
quire the earnest attention of the Con
gress.

gravity of the situation. Setting aside,
as logically unfounded or practically
inadmissible, tho recognition of tho
Cuban insurgents as belligerents, the
recognition of the independence of
Cuba, neutral intervention to end the
war by i

in favor of one or
forcible annexation of the * island, I
concluded it tfas honestly due to
friendly relations with Spai
should be given a reasonable chance to
realize her exectations of reform to
which she had become irrevocably com
mitted. Within a few weeks previously
she had announced comprehensive plans
which it was confidently asserted
be efficacious to remedy the evils so
deeply affecting our own country, so
injurious to the true interests of the
mother country
Cuba, and so
ng a rational compromise

î hal ii"
:
well as to those of
repugnant to the uni
versal sentiment of humanity.
The ensuing month brought little
sign of real progress toward the pacifi
cation of Cuba. The autonomous ad
ministrations set up in the capital and
some of the principal cities appeared
not to gain the favor of the inhabitants
to be able to extend their influence
to the large extent of territory held by
the insurgents, while the military
obviously unable to cope with the still
active rebellion, continued many of
the most objectionable and offensive
polioies of the government that had
preceded it. No tangible relief
afforded the vast numbers of unhappy
reconcentrados, despite the reiterated
professions made in that regard and
the amounts appropriated by Spain to
that end. The proffered exedient of
zones of cultivation proved illusory ;
indeed no less practical nor more de
lusive promises of succor could well
have been tendered ( to the exhausted
and destitute people, stripped of all
that made life and home dear, and
herded in a strange region among
sympathetic strangers hardly less ne
cessitous than themselves. *
By the end of December the mortality
among them had frightfully increased.
Conservative estimates from Spanish
sources placed the doaths among these
distressed people at over 40 per cent
from the time Gen. Weyler's decree of
r«concentration was enforced. With
the acquiescence of the Spanish
authorities a Boheme was adopted for
relief by charitable contributions
raised in this country and distributed,
under the direction of the consul
general and the several consuls, by
noble and earnest individual effort
through the organized agencies of tho
American Red Cross. Thousands of
lives were thus ■saved, but many thou
sands more wero in accessiDle to such
forms of aid.
The war continued
to
ns
the old footing
without comprehensive plan, develop
ing only the same spasmodic encoun
ters, barren of strategic results, that
bad marked the course of the earlier
ten years rebellion as was tho present
insurrection from its start. No alterna
tive save physical exhaustiou of either
combatant and there withal tho prnoti
of the island, lay in sight, but
how far distant no one could venture
to oonjeoture.
■
THE MAINE CATASTROPHE.
At this juncture, on .the 15th of
February last, occurred the destruction
of the battleship Maine while right
fully lying in the harbor of Havana
on a mission of international courtesy
aod good will—a catastrophe, the
picious nature and horror of which
stirred the nation's heart profoundly.
It is a striking evidence of the poise
and sturdy good sense distinguishing
national character that this shock
ing blow, falling upon a generous
people, already deeply touched by
ceding events in Cuba, did not
them to an instant, desperate resolve
to tolerate
longer the existence of a
condition of danger and disorder at
our doors that made possible such a
deed, by whomsoever wrought. Yet
the instinct of justice prevailed and
the nation anxiously awaited the re
sult of the searching investigation at
once set on foot. The finding of the
naval board of inquiry established that
the origin of the explosion
ternal by a submarine mine, and only
halted, through lack of. positive testi
mony, to fix the responsibility of its
authorship.
All these things carried conviction
to the most thoughtful, even before

the finding of the naval court, that a
crisis in our relations with Spain and
toward Cuba was at hand. So strong
was this belief that it needed but a
brief executive suggestion to tho Con
gress to receive immediate answer to
tho duty of makiuK instant provision
for the possible and perhaps speedily
probable emergency of war, and the
remarkable, almost unique, spectacle
was presented of a unanimous vote
of both Houses, on the 9th of March,
appropriating
national deft
every purpose connected therewith, to
be expended at the discretion of the
President.'* That this act of pro
vision came none too soon
closed when tho application of tho
fund
practically undufendod. Our navy
needed largo provision for increased
ammunition and supplies and even
members to cope with any sudden at
tack from the navy of Spniu, which
comprised modern vessels of tffe high
est typo of continental perfection. Our
army also required enlargement of men
and munitions. The detail of the
hurried preparation for the dreaded
contingency is told in tho roporta of
the Secretaries of War and of the
Navy, and need not be repeated here.
It is sufficient to say that the out
, when it did come, found
our nation not unprepared to meet
the conflict.
Nor was the apprehension of coming
strife confined to our own country.
It was folt by the continental po
which, on April 6th, through their
ambassadors and envoys, addressed to
the executive an expression of hone
that humanity and moderation might
mark the course of this government
and people, and that further negotia

its
NEGOTIATIONS WITH SPAIN.
Still animated by the hope of a
S paceful solution and obeying the
ictates of duty, no effort was relaxed
to bring about a speedy ending of the
Cuban struggle. Negotiations to this
objection continued actively with the
government of Spain, looking to tho
immediate conclusion of a six months'
armistice in Cuba,with a view to effect
the recognition of her people's right
to independence. Besides this, the
instant revocation of the order of ro
coneontration was asked, so that tho
sufferers, returning to their homes and
aided by united American and Spanish
effort, might bo put in a
port themselves, and, by
sumption of the well nfgh destroyed
productive energies of tho island, con
tribute to the restoration of its tran
quility and well hoiug.
Negotiations continued for some little
time at Madrid, resulting in offers by
the Spanish government which could
not but be regarded as inadequate. It
was proposed to confide the preparation
of peace to the insular parliament, yet
to bo convened under the autonomous
decrees of November. 1897, but with
out impairment in anywise of tho con
stitutional powers of thé Madrid gov
ernment, which, to that end, would
grant

and with what scope of discretionary
powers the insular parliament was ex

peace" did not appear. If it were
00 by negotiation with the insurgents,
the issue seemed to rest on the side
with a body chosen by a fraction of
the electors in the 'districts under
Spanish control, and
tne insurgent population holding the
interior country, unrepresented in the
so-called parliament, and defiant at
the suggestion of suing for peaco.
Grieved and disappointed at this
barren outcome of my sincere ondeavors
practicable solution, I felt
it my duty to remit the whole ques
tion to tho Congress. In the mossage
of April llth, 1898, I announced that

disappointing reception by Spain, the

native courses of action which had
been proposed, concluding that the
only one consonant with international
policy and compatible with
set historical traditions was interven
tion as a neutral to stop the
aud chock tho hopeless sacrifice of life,
oven though that rosort involved "hos
tile constraint upon both the parties to
tho contest, as well to enforce a truce
ns to guide tho eventual settlement."
The grounds justifying that step were,
tho interests of humanity ; the duty to
protect tho life and property of
citizens in Cuba; the right to check
commerce and people
through tho devastation of the island,
and, most important, the need of ro
und forever tho con
fh
injury to
moving at
stant menace and tho burdens entailed
upon our government by tho
taintics and perils of tho situation
caused by the unendurable disturbance
in Cuba. I said :

the name of civilization, iu behalf of
endangered American interests which
give ns tho right und the duty to speak
and to act, the war iu Cuba must stop. "
In view of all this, the Congress
asked to authorize and empower the
President to tako measures to secure a
full and final termination of hostilities
between Spain and the people of
Cuba, and to sec
establishment of a stable government,
capable of maintaining ordor and ob

Ho thereupon withdrew from Washing

French Ambassador and the Austro

with its communication to the Spanish
Minister hero, Gen. Woodford, the

Spain having thus denied the demand
of tne United States and initiated that
complete form of rupturo of relations
which attends a state of war, the
executive powers authorized by the
rasolutions
meet the enlarged contingency
war between sovereign states. On April
23d, I proclaimed a blockade of tho
north coast of Cuba, including ports
said coast between Cardenas and
Bahai Honda and tho port of Cien
the south coast of Cuba;
the 23d, I called for volunteers
to execute the purpose of the
lution. By my message of April 25th,
the Congress was informed of
tho situation, and I recommended
formal declaration of the existence of
a state of war between the United
Statos and Spain. The Congress
accordingly voted on the same day the
aot approvod April 25th, 1898, de
claring the existence of such war from
and inoluding tho 21st day of April,
and re-enacted the provision of the
resolution of April 20th, directing the
President to use all tho armed forces
of the nation to carry that net into
effect. Due notification of tho exist

It is not among tho least gratifying
incidents of tne struggle that the
obligations of neutrality woro impar
tially discharged by all, often under
delicate and difficult cireu?ustances.
In further fulfilment of international
duty I issued, April 26th, 1898, a
proclamation announcing the treatment
proposed to bo accorded to vessels and
their cargoes as to blockade, contra
band, tho exercise of the right of
search, and the immunity of neutral
flags and neutral goods under enemy's
Hag. A similar proclamation was made
by the Spanish government. In the
conduct of hostilities the rules of the
declaration of Paris, inoluding ab
stention from resort to privateering,
have accordingly been observed by
both belligerents, although neither was

CALIENT FEATURES OF THE WAIL
It is not within the province of this
message to narrate tno history of the
that followed the
extraordinary w
Spanish declaration of April 21st, but
a brief recital of its more salient
features is appropriate.
The first encounter of
in point
of date took plaoe April 27th, when a
detachment of the blockading squadron
made a reeonnoissaneo in force at Mh
tanzas, shelled tho harbor forts and
demolished several new works i
Btruotion.
The next engagement was destined
to mark a memorable epoch in mari
time warfare. J ho Pacifie fleet, under
Commodore George Dewey, had lain
for weeks at Hongkong. Upon the
colonial proclamation of neutrality
being issued and tho customary 24
hours' notice being gievn, it repaired
to Mirs Bay, near Hongkong, whence
it proceeded to the Philippine Islands
under telegraphed orders to capture
destroy the formidable Spanish fleet
then assembled at Manila. At day
break on the 1st of May the American
force entered Manila Bay and after a
few hours' engagement effected the
total destruction of the Spanish fleet,
consisting of 10 warships and a trans
port, besides capturing the navul
station and forts at Uuvite, thus
inhibiting the Spanish naval power; in
the Pacino Ocean and completely con
trolling the Bay of Manila, with tho
ability to take the city at will. Not a
life wns lost on our ships, the wounded
only numboring seven, while not a
vessel was materially injured. For
this gallant achievement the Congress,
upon my recommendation, fitly be
stowed upon tho actors preferment and
substantial reward.
The effect of this remarknblo victory
upon the spirit of our people and upon
the fortunes of the wur was instant. A

throughout the struggle. Reinforce
ments were hurried to Manila under
the command of Major-General Merritt
and firmly established within sight
of tho capital, which lay holploss be
fore our guDs.
On the soventh day of May the
government was advised officially of
the victory at Manila and at
quired of the commander of our fleet
what troops would be required. The
information was received on the 15th
day of May, and the first army ex
pedition sailed May 25th and arrived
off Manila Juno 30th. Othor
peditions soon followed, the total force
consisting of 641 officers aud 15,058 en

loss of life and property prevented the

Their forces invested Manila from tho
northern and eastern side, hut were
constrained by Admiral Dewey and
Gen. Merritt from attempting an
assault.. It was Utting that whatever
was to he done in tho way of decisive
operations in that harbor should bo
accomplished bv the strong arm of the
United States alone. Obeying the stern
precept of war which enjoins the over
coming of tho adversary and the ex
tinction of this powoi wherever assail
able as tho speedy and sure means to
a peaoe, divrdod victory was not
permissible, for no partition of the
rights and responsibilities attending
the enforcement of just and advan
tageous jMwvco could lie thought of
Following tho comprehensive scheme
of general attack, powerful forcos were
assembled at various points
coast to invade Cuba und Porto Rico.
Meanwhile naval demonstrations
made at several exposed points. On
May 11th, the cruiser Wilmington and
torpedoboat Winslow were unsuccessful
attempt to silence the batteries
at Cardonas, a gallant ensign, Worth
Bogley, and four seamen falling.
These grievous fatalities woro strangely
enough among the very few which
occurred during our naval operations
in this extraordinary conflict.
Meanwhile tho Spanish naval propa
rations had boon pushed with great
vigor. A powerful squadron under pn
Admiral Çervera, which had assembled
at the Cape Verde Islands before the
outbroak of hostilities, had crossed the an
ooean, and by its erratic movements in
the Caribbean Sea, delayed our mill
tary plana while baffling the pursuits t j u
of our Hoots. For a time fears were
felt lest, the Oregon and Marietta, then
nnnring home after their long voyage i n
from Han Francisco of over lu, 000 Q f
mliea, might bo surprised by Admiral a
Corvera's fleet, but their fortunate
arrival dispelled these apprehensions p„
and lent much needed reinforcements.
Not until Admiral Cervera took refuge
in the harbor of Santiago do Cubu, bia
about May 10th, was it practicable to
plan a systematic naval and military
attack upon tho Antillean possessions
of Spain. the
Several demonstrations occurred on ,
the coasts of Cuba and Porto Rico in
preparation for tho larger ©vent. On
May 13th the North Atlantic squadron
shelled San Juan do Porto Rico. On
May 30th, Commodore Schley's squad
ron hombarded tho forts guarding the
mouth of Santiago harbor. Neither
attack had any material result. It

The next act in the war thrilled not
alone tho hearts of our countrymen,
but the world by its exceptional
heroism. On the night of June 3d,
Lieut. Hobson, aided by seven devoted
volunteers, blocked tho narrow outlet
from Santiago harbor by sinking tho
collier Merriraao in tho channel, under
a tierce fire from the shore batteries,
escaping with their lives as by a
miracle, but falling into the hands of
the Spaniards. It is a most gratifying
incident of tho war, that the bravery
of this little band of heroes was cor
dially appreciated by the Spanish ad
miral, who sent a flag of truce to notify
Admiral Sampson of their safety and
to compliment them on their daring
act They wore subsequently exchanged
July 7th!
By Juno 7th. the cutting of the last
Cuban cablo isolated tho island. There
after the invasion was vigorously prose
cuted. On June 10th, under a heavy
protecting fire, a landing of GUO nm
rines from the Oregon, Marblehead and
Yankee was effected In Guantanamo
Bay, where it had been determined to
establish a naval station.
This important and essential port
was taken from the enemy after severe
fighting by the marines, who wore the
first organized force of the United
States to land in Cuba.

THE MOVEMENT» I1EKOUE SANTIAGO.
The position so won was hold despite
desperate attempts to dislodge our
forces. By Juno 16th, additional forces
landed and strongly intrenched.
On Juno22d, tho advance of the in
vading army under Major-General
Shatter landed at Baiquiri, about 15
miles east of Santiago. This
complishod under groat, difficulties,
but with marvelous dispatch. On Juno

was begun. On the 21th the first
serious engagement toon place, in
which the First and Tenth Cavalry
and the First United States Volunteer

heavily. By nightfall, however, ground
