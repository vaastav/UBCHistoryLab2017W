u Hi time of peace prepare for war,” is a,
good old adage, the plulosophy of which
has been exemplified both 15 our cost {vide
transactions of Secretary Floyd) and to our
honor and profit, when our volunteer com
panies were ready at the first, tap of the
drum to march and defend successfully our
capital and borders. The fact is one of his
tory that had it not been lor a few thousand
of volunteers, “ armed and equipped as the
law directs” the city of Washington would
•either have been in the hands of traitors or
a heap of ruins—possibly both. Had it
not been for our volunteer companies, (the
nucleus around which so many glorious
regiments have been formed) the material
which converts raw recruits into soldiers
would have been sadly more deficient than
it now is.
We have, as a State, between seventy
and eighty thousand men in the service of
Unde Sam! But how are we, as a city,
keeping up and cncouragingthe “solidarity”
of our citizens ? At the commencement of
this rebellion our city military would com
pare favorably with that of any city in the
Union. The major part of the Zouave
Cadets were then in our midst—all honor
to them and Ellsworth. That they have
made good use of their military knowledge,
the drill of regiments all over the States
will show; the Light Guard, whose rank
and file, once commanded by our present
Commander-In-Chief, McClellan, is now
diffused throughout the grand army of the
United States; the Chicago light Artillery,
who so nobly did their duty at Belmont,
“ and more too,” when then they first went
to Cairo; and last, but not least, the
Shields, Montgomery, Highland and Em
mett Guards, whose deeds of heroism
under Lyon at "Wilson's Creek (for some of
the members of the above companies were
there!) and under Mulligan at Lexington,
have won for them imperishable renown.
All those were Chicago institutions, and the
honor they have and will further win casts
a glory on Chicago.
The absence of the patriots whose names
once filled the roll-calls of the above com
panies have caused these organizations to
become “ things of yore,” and if oar young
men do not rally and fill up the ranks of
these companies they will cease to be a liv
ing reality in our midst.
IVe cannot to-day, with a population of
ifOjCCO, turn out a full company even to do
escort duty ip those brave hearts and will
ing hands who arc almost daily leaving
our city for the stem realities «f war. Tiffs
should not be. There arc hundreds of
young men in our city who waste their
evenings, which they might, with aperitive
physical benefit to themalves, devote to the
drill room, so that should it be necessary
to raise 500,000 more men to crush this
unholy rebellion, or repulse a foreign foe,
Chicago may be able to send her quota,
not of raw recruits, but of trained and dis
ciplined soldiers.
Young men of Chicago, you have a duty
to perform in this matter. All of you who
are able to bear arms ought to.be ready and
willing, if necessity demands it, to “foil in”
as soldiers of the Republic. We know not
■u hat the future may bring forth; the des
pots of the Old -World inay arraign them
selves against ns; a military autocracy may
threaten our liberty; reverses may deci
mate or destroy our forces now in the field.
Jf cither or any of these possibilities be
come tacts, would not our citizens, many
of them, wish that “in time of peace they
had prepared for war V
COLLECTION OP SOCXHEBX
DEBTS.
The important question first opened
practically by Judge Freese in Ms capacity,
of Provost Marshal of Alexandria, touching
the collection from Southern rebels of debts
due loyal Northern creditors, was arrested
while in full operation, by its being deemed
an illegal innovation in the functions of a
military court. The process was a seizure
of the goods, the court as Assignee securing
from the proceeds the rights of Northern
merchants. Numerous cases sprang up at
and the plan was hailed by the com
mercifiLintercst as opening the way for an
adjustment of Southern claims, many of
them deliberately a caned witha design of
subsequent shelter and non
payment. Even in the limited jurisdiction
of the Provost Marshal of Alexandria the
amount of claims was large, and the sums
at issue in judge Freese’s decisions were
daily increasing.
An order from Gen, McClellan put an
end to operations of this class temporarily,
awaiting the more formal introduction in
all our Military Courts of some similar sys
tem, duly authorized and instituted. And
thus the matter has remained since that
time.
This question of seeming the rights of
Northern creditors Against rebel debtors, Is
a most important one, and especially on the
eve of formidable movements which are
destined to pass border lines, and locate
the jurisdiction of Military Courts in the
rebellious Slates. The necessity increases
with tlic advance of our arms towards the
Gull The amount due Northern credi
tors in the South is estimated as high as
two and a half million dollars. And the
"West, if not equallywilh the greater com
mercial marts of the East, is as truly inter
ested in the adoption of some system that
shall completely meet the demands of the
case. The loyal people of the country will
have suffered losses enough even when the
utmost possible realisation of rebel effects
has been made in their favor, as can only
be done by HHitary Courts, where the re
bellion has suspended and crushed out the
functions of the Judiciary.
Justly enough, this formed a prominent
and well considered suggestion of the
President's Message, and it is probable that
it will take a tangible and effective form
at an early day. It is understood that the
views of the Attorney General have been
given advisedly to the establishment of
this branch of the ililimry Courts, holding
that Congress could not, under the Consti
tution, extend the powers of a Military
Court so as to give it civil jurisdiction.
Though Mr. Bales has never denied
the justice and equity of Judge Freese’s
action as Provost Marshal of Alpyandria
in behalf of Northern creditors, he denies
the right of the military to interfere in the
matter at all.
, The whole subject has been referred to
Congress by the President in his Message
and thence may be confidently expected
action thattimll cover a case one of the
anomalies of this war, but most pressing
and Important •? It is understood that Sir.
Bingham, of rffic Committee,
holds that there is no iitiaS&rion under the
Constitution to the dvfl power, as applica
ble to these cases, but he/hqhiajJthat there
is a constitutional power tovindwfrßftOlglW*
emergency as has now
try, and there is no doubt that very-soon
the result of the reference to this Commit
tee will be given to the country, in a tem
porary substitute for the ordinary courts in
.seceded Stales.
National Railroad to "Washington,
The project for a direct national railroad be
tween New York and Washington meets with
such favor in Congress and public circles, that
there is every reason to believe in its being
carried into effect. All summer long the mill-'
tary movements of the Government have been
seriously impaired by the slow-coach monop
oly of the New Jersey and Baltimore railroads.
Troops have been as long as twenty-two hours
on the way ; freights- take - weeks -to - get
through; and now that winter and a rebel
blockade have closed in upon tV- Potomac, •
the delay in obtaining army supplies is in
creased proportionally with the pressure upon
roads that refuse to enlarge their capacity. A
direct national road Is wantedpnad then the
Government may be independent, of their
monopolies, and the traveling public endure,
no longer, the per capita tax that goes Tnto
the treasuries*# New Jersey and Maryland.
The legislatures of those States may not, in
deed, charter other lines, but Congress has
foil power in the premises, under that clause
of tlxc Constitution which gives it authority
to build military roads; and there is an abun- -
dance of capital ready to be embarked In such
an enterprise without a dollar being drawn
from the public treasury. Congress can do
few things which would meet with a more
hearty popular response than'to sanction what
Is so clearly needful to jpromptly place at the
disposal of the Government,- in every emer
gency, the Inexhaustible material resources of
the great North.
Col. Jennison.
Those of our readers who have, with any
degree of faithfulness, followed our full Kan
sas correspondence will not fail to have de
rived from thcnco a full refutation of the
aspersions that lukewarm patriots and half
scccssionists are prone to cast upon this
commander, these making him. out to.be but
the leader of a band of marauding jayhawk
ere and banditti, eager only for spoils, little
caring who are the victims. Colonel Jenni
eon’s policy Is to draw the line strictly and
find out who arc the Union men and who are
the secessionists. Those who refuse the oath
are assessed to pay the expenses of the war.
He looks upon this war as precipitated upon
the country by those who have deliberately
plotted for the destruction of the Govern
ment. His view is that there are but two
parties, the friends and the enemies of the
Union. His process is to sift them out, and
protect Union men while he scourges the
rebels. Is not this right? The highest proof
that Colonel Jennison has strictly observed
all the rules of honorable warfare is the fact
that he has received for himself and the First
Kansas Cavalry the most marked testimonials
of favor and approval from his superior offi
cers. Recently General Hunter has attached
to his command three infantry regiments
with which he was to be dispatched to a new
field in Wee tern. Missouri. With officers like
him the rebellion is not safe, nor the rebels
themselves unharmed.
M There Is Corn In Egypt”
The ladies of Muroa, Southern Illinois, who
are organized as a soldiers* aid society, them
selves gathered aloadof com, last week, given
them hy the formers, drove it to town, and
sold it at auction (a young lady being auction
eer), at four cents above the market price;
‘the money to go for supplies for sick and
wounded soldiers. There's the true grit for
you.
Camp Butler not Paid Off,
A correspondent at Camp Butler, Spring
field, corrects our statement, derived from the
Journal of that city, that the troops at Camp
Butler were being paid off. He says the pay
master, though long looked for and earnestly
desired, had not arrived at last accounts; or
at least the boys had not seen him.
Sickness in the Camps.
The mortality in our army from camp sick
ness is probably more than doable the casual
ties of and there is now an amount of
sickness in the camps that it would be
almost impossible to estimate. There are
regiments on the Potomac that have not
enough well men to take proper care of the
sick. Out of 5,000 troops in General Critten
den's Federal brigade at Calhoun, Ky., fully
1,000 are sick. The surgeons of the regiments
at Port Royal report about onc-tcnth of their
force as unfit for duty. There are 2,600 sick
soldiers (principally typhoid fever) in the hos
pitals at Louisville. The Government, on ac
count of the pressure upon its Washington
hospitals, has opened hospitals at Philadelphia,
with accommodations for about 1,200 patients.
These arc only instances of the extent of sick
ness in the army. A fair proportion being
one in twenty, would give for our grand army
of half a million men in the fieldat least 25,000
men as the number unfit for duty, from causes
more or less serious.
Kentucky Military Expenses.
The Kentucky Legislature has received the
report of the Military Board, which shows
that up to the Ist of December there had been
18,812 volunteers cnlistedinto regiments other
than those commenced prior to the organiza
tion of the Board; including which, the aggre
gate of the enlistments would be some 25,000.
Tito Board have borrowed a million and a half
of dollars from the bants, (§500,000 from the
Bank of Kentucky,s3so,ooo from the Northern
Bank, $250,000 from the Farmere’ Bank, etc.,)
and have expended all but $146,000 of it in the
outfit and payment of troops. The Board
Lave arranged for further advances from all
the banks. They have ordered 17,000 suits of
clothing and 20,000 overcoats, to meet the ne
cessities of the time. The regiments arc now
nearly all in the field, and others that have not
entered the service arc being consolidated.
Several questions having arisen relative to
these consolidations, the parties aggrieved are
referred to the Legislature.
Fires and Loss of Lite.
At Providence, R. 1., last week Thursday,
a tenement house near Thurston & Gardner's
works, was destroyed by fire, caused by a
child’s lighting a match, and two children of
Patrick Conly, (a soldier of the 3d regiment)
were burned to death, and Mrs. C. badly in
jured in endeavoring to save them.
At Newark, N. J., on Thursday, three cliil
dreu of Walter Spear being left alone in the
house, the younger one crept upon the table,
upset a Kerosene lamp, and this one and an
elder child were burned to death.
The N. T. Journal of Commerce of the
12th inst., contains a long communication
relative to the Farm mortgages along the line
of the Racine & Mississippi Railroad, through
Winnebago, Stephenson and Carroll counties,
in Illinois, from the State line to the terminus
at Savannah, on the river. The case is simi
lar to that along the line of the LaCrossc &
Milwaukee, the road hopelessly bankrupt, and
in the hands of the bondholders, and the J
holders of the mortgages having their only
recourse in the mortgages themselves. In
many cases the mortgagors have commenced
proceedings in onr StatcCourts for the purpose
of vacating the mortgages, and bringingsuits
against the railroad company, but no decree
has ns yet been rendered, according to the
writer in question, who adds: In a few ex
ceptional cases the mortgagors are solvent,
and able to pay the whole claim. In most
cases, however, the mortgagors have little to
offer in settlement save the mortgaged prem
ises. In almost every case the property mort
gaged is of less value than the amount of the
note which it was given to secure. The prop
erty was appraised at a time when all real es
tate was extravagantly high, and in many, in
fact in most cases, the agents to procure the
subscription were the appraisers of the prop
erty mortgaged, «
|Sf“ The recent spark of disturbance in the
House of Representatives, to which editorial
reference was made in our last issue, the news
item accompanying it being inadvertently
omitted, took place in the course of debate
upon the question of Military Investigations,
in which Mr. Conway of
the Belmont affair as a rebel victory. This
was sharply resented by Mr.jFoukc of Illinois,
to whom Mr. Conway as sharply responded.
Mr. Richardson of Illinois said that elsewhere
was a proper place for the adjustment of per
sonal difficulties. The late report was that
friends of both parties were tiying to
adjust the aSair amicably. This should be
the first, last, and only instance of the kind
this present session. The danger of the Gov
ernment, in the name of humanity and decen
cy, should keep our legislators from priratc
personal squabbles. As to the Belmont affair,
we ourselves trust we arc to have no more
victories that require a labored argument to
prove them such.

he continued, “that the American gentlemen

For the army surgeons this is an Invaluable
work, and every one of them should procure
a copy and study it carefully, at the earliest
possible moment. In fact the entire medical
profession and the intelligent public will find
it a most valuable work. The causes which
promoted the health or produced the diseases
in the army In the Crimea; the effect* and the
treatment of gun-shot wounds in all parts of
the system, are all treated in a masterly man
ner. "We repeat that all army surgeons should
at once study the work.

Canadian Military Preparations.
Enrollment of Tboops.—The London
Times calls upon the Canadian authorities to
enroll and drill 100,000 men this winter, and
the Montreal Gazette says if the Canadian Gov
ernment but gives the proper enconragement
and the work is entered upon with proper
spirit, it can he done.
Drilling.—Notices of the drill of the 47th
regiment on the Champ de Mars, near Mon
treal, is given in the Montrc;il papers.
Engineers.—A detachment of royal engi
neers left Quebec for Toronto on Monday
week. They took with them gun carriages
for the new batteries at Toronto.
On the Move.—Lieutenant-General Sir
Fenwick Williams, K. C. 8., with Capt. De
Winton, A. D. C., and Capt. Grant, A. D. C.,
of his staff, paid a visit to Collingwood on the
7th inst., for the purpose of having that place
put in a state of defence, and give directions
for the construction of two batteries for the
' harbor, one to be located at or near the old
Hurontario Mills, abontamile to the eastwsird
of the town, and the other on one of the
group of islands known as the “Hen and
Chickens,” about three miles from shore to
the westward. A naval depot is to be estab
lished at Collingwood.
Fortifications at Toronto. —Men arc
busily engaged on the fortifications at Toron
to. Ten 64 pounder guns reached that place
from Quebec, lately, and arc to be mounted
on the embankments in course of construc
tion.
Two Regiments Coming.— Mr. Canard, of
the well known steamship line, says the Mon
treal Witness, passed through Montreal on
Friday afternoon for Quebec, at the request, it
is understood, of the Canadian Government.
The 62d and another regiment arc to bo sent
to Upper Canada, from Halifax, forthwith;
and it is surmised that some arrangement will
be made with the Canard Company to bring
up these troops as far, at least, as Riviere du
Loup before the close of navigation.
The SOxn Regiment.— The 30th regiment of
regulars is quartered at Toronto.
Natal Brigade in Toronto.— -The Globe
states that there is a brisk movement on foot
to establish a naval brigade in Toronto. The
Royal Canadian Tacbt Club has taken the
initiative In the matter, and the Secretary has
already secured a large number of names of
persona who purpose joining. The members
intend to apply immediately to the Govern
ment to supply them with some heavy gnus
for practice.
Militia Movements. —Under a general or
der from headquarters at Quebec, dated BtU
inst, the following new corps are authorized
and accepted: The 3d rifle company, of Que
bec ; a volunteer company of engineers at
Quebec; a rifle company at Ottawa; two com-
panies of rifles at Lcnnoxviile; a rifle company
at Toronto, and another at Hemmingford. A
field battery has been formed at Port Col
bomc. The Ist (or Prince of Wales) regi
ment of rifles must have nearly fall ranks, as
promotions arc published in Company No. 0.
Lastly, “Hy. Chapman, gentleman,” has been
promoted to the Adjutantcy of the “Montreal
Sedentary Cavalry.”
Gen* Lockwood and the Turkeys.
Gen. Henry H. Lockwood, who commanded
the expedition into Accomac county, can be
spared from troubling himself further in de
fence of this Government. He made a failure
of the whole thing, unless it be excepted that
he succeeded admirably well in showing him
self to be an unmitigated failure. Wc have al
ready noticed his anxiety for his hat. Here is
how he looked out for the turkeys:
“ Quite a ludicrous scene transpired in the
camp of the Michigan Sixth yesterday, in
which our Brigadier General played a promi
nent part. It seems that the General was
treating himself to an airing in his carriage,
when he mot a soldier oa the road with a de
capitated turkey in his hand. The General
stopped him, inquired where lie belonged, and
was particularly anxious to know all about the
turkey. The soldier told him that he had pur
chased it, and the General drove off apparent
ly satisfied. But the turkey lay heavily on his
mind. He could not imagine how a private
could honestly possess a turkey; and if a sol
dier could so far forget himself a s to 1 purvey ’
a fowl of such magnificent dimensions, espe
cially while being furnished by the Government
with so rich a diet as sweet potatoes, he ought
to be made an example of. So the General drove
off to the camp of the Michigan hoys, having
in the meantime worked himself up into a fu
rious rage, swearing that, if found, the soldier
should be shot, ana ordered an investigation.
The companies were all paraded, and the
search begun, the General making the rounds
with the company officers. The Michigan
boys wen? stupmed with astonishment at first,
but finally the General was startled by the
gobbling of a turkey in his rear. He turned
bis head to look for the offender, when anoth
er clever imitation of a turkey-cock was heard
in front, and then a perfect storm of turkey
culls, cock-a-doodle-doos, the hissing of geese,
and oilier specimens of barn-yard vocalism
broke out all over the camp. The General
beat a retreat, and, on going out of the gate,
found a pole erected, on which were con
spicuously placed fifteen or twenty turkey,
chicken and geese beads.
No Famine In Ireland*
There are some reasons for believing that
the reports of such deficient crops in Ireland
as would cause a famine there arc greatly ex
aggerated. Sir Robert Peel, Chief Secretary
for Ireland, who has recently made an extend
colour of the island, said in a speech at Bel
fast :
“lean confidently assert that the reports
and rumors which hare been circulated about
a famine in this country have been greatly ex
aggerated. I speak on the authority of per
sonal observation, I leave those who can
write in secluded districts of Connaught the
task of refuting, if they can, what I know
to be true. Xu Sligo, in Donegal, I
hear very different accounts from those
which I had been led to belieTe, and
from personal observation in Mayo and Gal
way, and from letters I have received, I am as
sured that nothing of the kind that was al
leged exists. Of course, lam ready to admit,
with every gentleman in this room, that there
has been a comparative fiulnre in the potato
crop, and that food will be dear, but a scarcity
offoodisnot necessarily a famine, and it &
very easy to understand the interested mo
tives of some who are anxious to gain public
applause by a feigned zeal for the public in
spreading about these exaggerated rumors.
Now, I must say, as fir as myself am con
cerned, I do not find that these apprehensions
arc in any way likely to be realized.”
The Toledo JBfcufr, of the 13th, says
there arc now nineteen thousand eight hundred
barrels, in bulk, of freight, principally pro
duce, to go forward to a market, in the depot
of the Toledo, Wabash and Western Railroad
Company, brought in over that line. This is
over three hundred carloads, and is the accu
mulation of two weeks, since the closing of
navigation.--, , - -

Since my lost nothing of Importance has
transpired in this Division, except that such
movements arc being madeinthewnyoferect
ing buildings and fortifications as would in
duce the most superficial observer to believe
that wc-arc preparing for winter quarters and .
,a great military depot in good earnest. The
troops have been waiting expectant for the or
der to advance, into the country; but an ad
vancc at present does not seem to be In the
programme of ourlcader. He is reported to
have answered a member of the Cabinet at
Washington, in reply to a hint to advance,
that “ if they wish an advance made before he
is ready to make it, that they must send some
one else to lake his place.”
Wc learn from the Southern papers, which
you hare doubtless seen, that the enemy are
making all possible preparations for a vigor
ous defence—erecting batteries at all necessa
ry points, drafting in all who will not volun
teer, urging, coaxing, threatening, worrying.
Nothing seems to annoy them so much—if
wc can judge from the tone of the Southern
press, and their conduct as reported hy the ,
contrabands who daily escape from them—as
the course the negroes take in neglecting to
follow their masters in the general melee.
The papers recommend the use of cavalry
to scour the country and drive them in, or
li use means to prevent their escape to the enemy P'
Rather significant that, in connection with
the foot currently believed here, by the unani
mous report of fugitives hither, that the rebels
arc slaughtering without mercy all whom they
catch attempting to fly to our protection.
Cotton houses, com houses and buildings
arc being burned by the slaveholders,
and they likewise threaten to lay their,
towns in ashes on the approach of the Union
ists. Ido not remember whether in my last
I acquainted yon with the fact that several of
the soldiers at Fort‘Walker were shot for re
fusing to fight, or rather for declaring that
they would not light. This was before our
arrival. Two or three are believed to have
been shot down by their officers the day of our
victory; and during the time they were build
ing the works, an average of fifty men were at
work with ball and chain, for attempting to
escape. These were the non-slaveholding re
cruits, called “crackers,” who were forced
into the Southern army; and that the Southern
army UfuU of sue ft, I do not the least doubt.
Much must be deducted from the statements
of the negroes, but not so much in matters of
this sort as you may imagine. On all points
which could be tried and tested and compared
with known facts, they have been strangely
truthful.
Wlille in occupancy of the Seabrook planta
tion, frith our company, during-the past week,
I had long conversations with “Billy,” the
body servant of an officer of the Beaufort
Guerillas, who were posted on the Island. He
is intelligent and smart—a mulatto. By the
way, I had underrated the general in
telligence of the negroes here. Even the field
hands have ideas of their own as* to how, why
and. what. They make common cause, and
what “ Billy” hears read from the newspapers
at his master’s table, becomes common
properly in the “ quarters” with
Gumbo and Coffee, within twenty-four hours,
all hints, all expressed mistrust, even
hidden fear on the part of hints incautiously
exposed is caught by the watchful ears of men
and women who have long hoped and looked
for on event like the present. Even
the looks end actions of confident masters
! arc translated by the watchful eye of supposed
trusty servants, and arc promulgated among
the “hands.” Talk of “trusty servants
who will fight for their masters 1”
the thing is a monstrous absurdity.
If such people exist among the slaves, they
do not exist in iSouthem Carolina. There is no
such thing. Pinckney, after liis hasty flight
to the main, resolved to return and burn bis
buildings, some full of com and cotton. (He
owned Pinckney Island, which lies right oppo
site the Seabrook place, and we made visits
there, containing three fine plantations,
working about 4GO slaves.) His trusty negro
William, who had driven on Espetango plan
tation for over 20 years, and whom*he had
taken with him to the main, discouraged him
by saying “The Yankees arc all around the
island, master, and they will catch you; let
me go.” William came with full instructions
in regard to ascertaining our force, and how to
proceed, &c., &c„ much of which he detailed
to me, but Mr. Pinckney has not seen William :
since. “I am old,” said 'William to me, “but
I want to die rather than go back to Master
Pinckney.” Set it down once for all, if Vie
negroes knew their we should have no
need of Jforthn-n soldiers to put down this rebel
lion. It would be destroyed by flames, lighted
by those who are vaunted- to be ready to die
for its promoters. “Master,” said “Billy”
to me, not in reply to any question of mine,
but of his own accord, “there are a great many
of the rebel soldiers who will not fire a shotat
vour troops when you advance upon
them.” “Ho you think so?” “Why?”
“Indeed, sir, I A-notrit. I have heard several
• say so in Master Striven’s company (the Guer
illas) aud several were shot at the fort, be
cause they ran away, and, when brought back,
declared they would not light the Union mm.
None of the ‘crackers’ will fight you. They
had enough men to make a company at work
with a bull and chain for the same reason, and
more down in the black-hole, at the Port, all
for that very some reason. Master Scrivcn
and Master Dupont used to talk about it and
say they were afraid some of our company
wouldn’t fight either.”
The above, somewhat improved into Eng
lish, is the exact language of one of the in
telligent mulattoes who had ample opportu
nity to know, and its sentiments are corrobo
rated in every conversation with the negroes.
Concerning our present doings, under the
supervision of Col. Sewell, of the Engineers,
a lorlificatlon enclosing a piece of country. |
(including Port Walkcr) about a mile in length
by about three-quarters of a mile in width at
widest part, is being erected. It will be on
approved and scientific principles. There arc
being rapidly mounted very large guns from
the fleet, some of which are drawn from the
binding by 13 horses. The works arc being
made higher and the ditches broader and deep
er than were the walls and ditches of Fort
"Walker, which is now but a mere point inside
the outer works, and there arc about 3,000
at work upon them constantly. Immense de
pots for stores, one of which'is over 300 feet
iu length, are being erected, vast sheds
for horses and forage aud numerous, other
buildings for hospital and other purposes
are in rapid course of construction or already
completed. These, in addition to the build
ings found here, the work of the rebels. A
large bakery is nearly completed. The sut
ler was 15 large wooden houses, on their way
hither from New York, so you can sec that a
permanence is pointed. "Who knows but
that in this excellent situation of land, and
upon tins magnificent border, a city of no
mean size may not yet arise to eclipse even
Charleston or Savannah? You have learned
that a Post Office has been established here,
mail matter to be directed via New York.
Mr. Jacob Sears, who accompanied the expe
dition as supercargo of the Vanderbilt, is the
Post Master.
The health of the troops is now much im
proved, and it is rapidly becoming healthy.
The entire change of diet and climate, togeth
er with the exposure by the vessels ana the
early part of our stay here, caused much sick
ness; but the acclimation seems to be about
over, and all looks well now.
To instance the contrast between the cli
mate here and in Chicago, I picked oranges
and roses on the Ist of December from trees
and rose bushes still in full verdure and bloom.
Until yesterdayit has been too warm, but to
day it is pleasantly cook The nights are, how
ever, chilly, and fires arc then comfortable.
The dews foil very heavy.
There has as yet been no reinforcement of
our army here, out such is expected by us.
If anything of importance happens, yon will
hear from Sandwich,

A Paine Alarm at Port Boyal,
[Cor. Philadelphia Press, Dec. 3.]
The first alarm we have yet bad was about
three o’clock on the morning of the 3d, and it
was false,. But it brought out the whole army,
and made the sick very generally well. In tbe
Roundhead Regiment, so many have not an
swered to their names since we landed. A pri
vate of the Third Brigade had got oat some
way beyond the pickets, foraging on his own
account, and having been absent two or three
days, wanted to get in as quietly as possible,
when the guards fired on him, and bang went
eight or ten guns along the line, and the long
roll beat, rousing tbe whole expeditionary
corps of Port KovaL In ton or fifteen minutes
onr regiment was In lino with guns loaded,
and the Adjutant bore tbe intelligence of our
awaiting orders to the General. In a few min
utes he returned. Ho had fonnd the General
cuddled up comfortably In hia blankets. The
orders were such as a good General might bo
expected to issue from sneb quarters, viz: that
the regiment should go to bed, which were
wdl received and punctiliously obeyed.
Burners from Northeast BOssonri.

There was a rumor on the street yesterday
that Col. Moore bad been badly whipped in

Another report, and more reliable, la that
CoL Glover had been attacked near Edina and

It is certain that Northeast Missouri is

To Col. Joseph H. Tcckbh, Commanding Camp
Douglas;
Sib:—The imdersigned'beg-leavejtorepre
sent that they arc commanders of companies
in the lit Segiment United Stoics Mechanic Pu
sileers, and- that they-recruited and formed
their companies from 'various States other
than the State of Illinois, and brought them
to Chicago to join the regiment as on indepen
dent one of a peculiar character, viz: as Me
chanic Fiusikers, and that : injhlnlng this regi
ment it was not their mtentiontojoin an-Illi
nois regiment, but to join-ah United States
regiment: and that if any - State may of right
set up a claim to us as volunteers, wc humbly
submit it should be the States from which we
have brought our • companies aud of
which wc are citizens, and-we beg to state
that the report of the Adjutant of the State of
Illinois to Governor Tates, in which we are
classed with the unnumbered infantry troops,
gives much dissatisthetion -to our; men, and
should, as we thinly with all due deference to
the high authorities of the ‘State of Illinois,
be corrected.
As you, sir, are conversant with all these
facts, and, as wc suppose, are willing to do usa
kindness, we beg yon to favor us and our
companies so‘far as to represent these things
to the State Adjutant, and Ask his attention
thereto,..-
With sentiments of high esteem, we beg
leave to subscribe our names.

Bemabks.— Much opposition towards the
recruiting of this regiment has been manifest
ed in all the States outside of Illinois;- from
which companies have come; and on the
ground that those States would get no credit
for the men So furnished to the. Government.
It Is attempted in some of those States tOTC
pudiate the citizenship of volunteers in this
regiment for the purpose’cutting them off
from State bounties, and and future;
while the fact that want of citizenship in Hli
nob cuts off the same volunteers from her
favors. The bestway is for each State acknowl
edge and claim her own, and thus do mrinjus
tice to the interests of the meritorious Fusi
leere.

Upon the requisition of the superintendents,
a suitable number of volunteer officers, non

Liberated Native Africans.
The Colonization Herald recapitulates that
during the year to April 23,1861, eight Ameri
can slavers were overliauled in the high seas,
and their living freight deposited In the re
public of Liberia. The subjoined table gives
the names and dates of the slavers arrested
and by what cruisers taken, the number of
Africans captured and landed in Liberia, and
the mortality which occurred in the interven
ing period:

The Wildfire, William and Bognia were
boarded on the Cuban coast, and brought into
Key West, Florida, Landing there fourteen
hundred and thirty-two souls. During the
two months of their sojourn at Key West, a
mortality occurred of two hundred and ninety
four, and on the voyage from thence, of two
hundred and forty-seven. The total of deaths
from time of capture until the ships reached
Liberia, foots up six hundred and one I
The other slavers were seized in the South
African waters, near the Congo country, were
proceeded with direct to Monrovia, and the
survivors placcd in charge of the U. S. Agent,
resident in that city. Their numbers were
but slightly reduced, except those of the
Nightingale. These are reported to have been
kept and poorly fed In the barracoons for
three months before they were shipped. Con
sequently they were in worse condition than
others. Dr. J. M. Moore, physician to the
rccaptives in Liberia, states that “ a majority
of them were mere walking skeletons. In
landing them, and during the passage from
the ship to the shore, three died m the boats,
two after reaching the wharf, and five in the
harbor, all withm a few hours.” Such arc
gome of the cruelties of the slave trade.
The ability of Liberia to' receive and prop
erly provide for such a$ influx of heathen
Africans, shows an amount of strength and
resource which few were prepared to expect.
Freight Business or the wnehigap
Southern Railroad to Toledo.
[From the Toledo Blade, Saturday Erening.
At the close of navigation, less two
weeks since, this Company had 4,000 barrels
of flour in their freight house, intended for
lake shipment from this port. They hare now
on band 20,500 barrels of floor, 2,5w boxes of
bard bread, 6,000 barrels of barrels
of highwines, and 650 barrel oflard> piled up
in their freight sheds, all of which is to be
shipped through as fast as facilities for mov
ing it can be obtained; showing a total of
thirty-one thousand one hundred and fifty
barrels. This docs not include probably from
300 to 500 barrels of beef and hams. In addi
tion to the above, there are also In the houses
of the road 40 cars of miscellaneous freight,
consisting principally of hides, .broom com,
wheat (in hags) and clover seed —and allowing
tight tons to each car, we have in this last
item three hundred and twenty tons. This
road has also brought to this city within a
short time past, large Quantities of boxed
pork, the exact amount of which we cannot
give. The past two days, however, the quan
tity received has been nearly 300,000 pounds.
The receipts of grain have fallen off largely
since the close of navigation, hut in every
other respect the business of the line
continued as it 'was T> early in the season,
pressing heavily upon the facilities of the
Company for removing freight presented
along the route; and wc are of the opinion
that this has been done in a more satisfactory
; manner this year than ever before in the his
tory of the road; at least..complaints along
I the route have been less frequent than foe-
I mcrly.

TEDS TBIBUIfE FOB 1863«
Opinion* ofthe North-Wertem Pres**
[From the Kcwanee (llenfyCo.)DiaL]
In a succeeding column wc present the Pros
pectus of the Chicago Tribune 1 for the coming
year. We need not say to those: in the habit of
reading it, that the Tuibukb is an nnrlvalcd neics
paper: that the Editorial department Js conducted
with signal ability, and that it speaks out with
great boldness on all current questions. Some
ififrpfc {t too bold, but it is better to err on the side
of boldness than that of timidity. Others again—
as in the esse of Fremont—charge its zeal to mer
cenary motives—coveted contracts and what not.
Knowing the leading editors as we do, wc do not
for a moment credit this impeachment of their In
tegrity; knowing them to be men of common
sense, we cannot believe, supposing them to be
dishonest, that they would be running after chance
game when they can coin thousands annually by
closely attending to their legitimate .business.
The great recommendation ofthe Tbibunn, in oar
estimation, Is that it is aJitc, and presents all
sides of every question, without fear or favor.
Long may-lt wave I ...
[From the Watertown (Wls.) Republican.]
It is the leading journal IntheNorth-weat; able,
independent, ana contains on unusual amount of
matter, compared with other papers. We have no
doubt it will be found fully satisfactory to those -
desiring a paper of this class.
[Froin the Mishawaka (Ini) Enterprise.)
This is the best paper in all respects this side of
Hew York Citr, if not the best In the Union, and
we call the attention of our readers to~ it, and
recommend them, if they wish all the news at the
earliest possible moment, on la advance of any
other paper, to subscribe for it at once.
[From the Henry County(UL) Chronicle.]
The Chicago Thievne has a larger circulation,
—a greater popularity,—and probably more ene
mies—than any other paper to either Wisconsin,
Indiana. lowa, or. Illinois. As a news paper, it
meets the entire expectations of the reading pub
lic; ftTui as an independent talking paper, it excels
—hence its enemies. Its boldness, it is true, on
some occasions, apparently borders on rashness
and extremes, ana therefore, elicits a torrent of
lampoons (almost as hi rtfol as harpoons) from the
opposition—which, for the time-being, -wound it*
. influence and patronage, but, like a whale among
little fishes,—ft rises again to “Wow” the fiercer.
The Fremont imbroglio created a large number of
enemies for that paper, but the result will doubt
less be that the paper was right. The name of
Fremont was fascinating ere me fall ot Lyon and
Lexington, hut after which it lost charms that
Time cannot recover. It was the Government of
the Tsited States that removed Fremont—not the
Chicago Teibune. We have no doubt but that
the cause ef so much howling at this paper, is
“For lack,
Of something else, to hew and hack.”
H is a self-sustaining, influential and instruc
tive journal; and believing that it wIT. survive
the existence and attacks or either and all of its
hostile contemporaries, (Wm. Kellogg—“or any
other man,” included.) we advise our readers to
peruse the prospectus and act accordingly.
[Frcm the Oquawka (HI.) Flaindealer.)
This energetic and fearless newspaper ha» won
for itself a place In nearly every neighborhood in
the Northwest. In its bold attacks npon the oli
garchy of the South, in which it holds them up to
view as clearly the Instigators of our national diffi
culties, and advocates the abolition of the system
which has fostered and built them up as the surest
and speediest wav of ending the rebellion, it has
struck a chord in the Northwest which vibrates in
unison with itself, and secured a position which
no ether journal has attained. As a channel of
news it has no equal in the West. It ranks high
as a commercial paper, and in every feature of a
newspaper has but few if any superiors.
The Tbibunb has circulated widely in this
neighborhood: and though it has made a few ene
mies became of the radical positions thev think it
takes on the question of slavery, yet even these
begin to gee that its most radical news will prob
ably soon be adopted as a military necessity. It
has done a great work in disseminating proper
views of the contest in which we arc now engaged
to preserve the life of the Republic. Long may it
live.
IF tom the Leavenworth Conservative.}
The Chicago TiUßcrre is the best paper in the
West—that is, West of New York City. A good
test of the value of a paper is the eagerness with
which you seek It, and. among a hundred ex
changes, the most eagerlv sought in this office is
the Chicago Thoitxe. Kansas men who want a
first-class paper will find it In the Chicago Tbi
huke. We like the thing, aud give this notice
solely for that reason.
[From the Columbia City (Ind.) Republican.]
The Chicago Tnißnxß is one of the live papers
of the age, and should he read by all. If you are
not able to take the daily, send for the weekly or
tri-weekly, and you will* be a posted man, if you
should read no other paper. Ir contains a com
plete daguerreotype of the passing events of the
world, its great excellence, however, consists in
the noble and manly stand it has taken aud unwav
eringly maintained in support of the Government
in this struggle. Always in the advance upon
every question of human right, a fearless and bold
advocate of truth and justice, makes it the paper
for the million. A large list of the daily is taken
and read in this place now, but we wish it were
doubled aud trebled.
[From the Knoxville (Iowa) Republican.]
The Chicago Thibcnb is the very best Western
paper received at this office, aud brings us two or
three days later news than any of the East ernpapers.
It is large, well printed, ana contains all the im
portant news of the day, together with the latest
and best commercial reports, and a variety of
reading matter that will suit everybody. The cor
respondence is the most extensive ana reliable of
any paper west of New York, and the editorials
able, “ voluminous and vast,” and to the point.
[From the Renselaer (Ind.) Gazette.]
The Chicago Thibuke is the most enterprising
journal published in live West, and is decidedly
better adapted to the wants of our people than all
the Eastern.papcrs combined. It advocates most
thoroughly and ably everything that pertains to
this section of country—education, agriculture,
science, news, commerce, politics and literature.
By it we receive dispatches one day later than any
other source. Wo would recommend it above any
other paper wc know of outside our own Stale.
{From the Grand Rapids (Mich.) Eagle.]
Those who wish a lire and spicy paper, the
largest, too, in the West, will do well to subscribe
for the Chicago Tjubuxe. published daily, tri
weekly and weekly. It is eminently a live sheet
and an interesting one. Though wc do uot always
agree with its positions, we look upon it as oue
of the most valuable of onr exchanges.
[From the Rockford (111.) Mirror.]
We have not in all respects admired the course
of the Tihbcsb in regard to some of the events
connected with the present war, bnt as a wide
awake, live neKvtpaper, it has few equals aud no
superiors. Its special telegraphic correspondence
is very extensive, involving a heavy expenditure,
and its columns always contain not only a vast
amount of reading matter, but the latest intelli
gence from all parts of the country.
[From the Nebraska Republican.]
The Thibubb furnishes more reading matterto
Its subscribers than any newspaper west of Cin
cinnati, except, perhaps the Missouri Republican,
(Democratic.) and what is equally important, it ii
edited with consummate ability—is sound to the
core on the Vnion question—and is, in short, in
every respect, a first class newspaper. Itsprox
!mi;yto Nebraska renders it the must desirable
paper, outside of the Territory, which our people
can patronize.
[From the Pekin (111.) Patriot.]
We hare been attentive readers of the Tribune
for a long time, and can add oar voice to that of a
score of other journals in recommending it to the
nubile—to Republicans and Patriots in particular.
It is fearless and bold in its editorials, and unwav
ering in its devotion to the Union, and handles the
aiders, abettors or sympathizers of the cursed
rebellion without gloves. We advise ail who
a genuine anti-pro-slavery paper to send for the
Tribune.
From the Ottawa (111.) Republican.)
The Tktoi i? one of the most energetic and
go-ahead journals in the country. and although
sometimes a little too caustic for conservatives,
they all have to get it for the news, while to a
great share of the most intelligent population, its
course is just what is wonted. It is the leading
paper of the West. *•
[From the Aledo (III.) Record.]
We feel that we could pay the Tribune no high
er compliment than in saving, while we have dis
approved some things in Its course, it is a paper
that we caunot afford to do without, and our feel
ing would be the same were wo in any other busi
ness. When asked by friends what paper from
abroad we would advise them to take, our Invaria
ble reply has- been, if they could take but one,
“the Chicago Tribune.”
[From the Michigan City (Ind.) Enterprise.)
The Tribune may he considered as the best ex
ponent of newsyaper enterprise and go-a-heada
tiveness in the West. It has a circulation of near
40,tC0. and represents the strongest phase of anti
slavery sentiments in the free Northwest. May
the Tribune live a thousand years, and its circula
tion never be less.
5820 4479 SOI
[From the Freeport (I1L) Journal.]
Though we have frequently deemed it our duty
tcjdisscut from the views of the Tribune on minor
points, on the great question of the hour, it meets
our cordial approbation, and at all times, whether
speaking views with which weagreo, or from which
we dissent, we find it bold, fearless, able and orig
inal. As a neiwpapcr it has no equal in the West.
Full of enterprise and tact, it fills its columns with
a readable and attractive variety. It permits
nothing of interest to escape it. On the whole, we
don't see how the West could get along without its
Tbibune.
[From the Marshall (Mich.) Statesman.]
Of all our exchanges we read none with keener
relish than this, the great paper of the Northwest.
While compelled to dissent from many of its news
in regard to the prosecution of the war, wo can
not but admire its bold, out-spoken course. It
possesses the (in. these limes) important quality
of cowrope.always speaking “right out in meetinV’
and generally in s style intended to be heard. For
. this reason it has its enemies, those who dislike
to approach the subject of our nation's great dis
order and its primal cause with anything out sugar
coated words, whichin themselves mean little, and
are uttered in a tone which deprives them of even
that merit. It has also its friends who would
stand by it to the death . because of its proverbial
independence. Such a paper is a public necessity;
for the war, its cause, and the issues arising there
from, cannot be to prominently ventilated before
the people. To such of our people, who from the
winter arrangement of our trains desire a Chicago
paper, wc heartily recommend the Tribune.
[From the Marshall (Iowa) Times.]
The Chicago Tkibuxe Is one of the best and
most influential papers of the Northwest, if not
the beet. Its news matter is of the most- reliable
kind, and is later than can he got from any other
source.
[From the Lyons (Iowa) Mirror.]
There is little call for recommending a paper
which is so well known that two-thirds of the
people are eithercursing or defending it; hut we
nave no hesitation in pronouncing the Chicago
Tribune the best ‘Western ««r#-paper read in this
community. Its administration of the govern
ment and conduct of the war does not quite suit
ue. but its news we must have.
[From the Casa County (Mich.) Bepuhlican.)
Chicago Tbxbunb.— 'VTe call attention to the
prospectus of tills valnahle paper, in another col
umn. As a newspaper, the Tribune ia far ahead
of any of. its Chicago cotcmporarics. Besides the
regular dispatches, it has a large corps of special
correspondents, by which means it is enabled to
furnish its readers with the latest news in advance
of all others. To those wishing to take a Chicago
paper, wc cordially recommend the Tbibunk.
[Ottumwa (Iowa) Courier.)
The Chicago Tkibuse. —The prospectus of the
above paper will be found elsewhere, and we com
mend u to the notice of our readers. The Tribune
is a live, independent, outspoken Journal, pub
lished at Chicago, the comercial centre of the
West, strong for the Union, and devoted to the in
terests of the Great Northwest, where it should
have a large and generous support. No foreign
paper, it seems to ns, is better adapted to the
wants of this region, than the Chicago Tamtmß.
[Prom the Decatur (III.) Chronicle.)
Chicago Tkibuke.— We call attention to the
prospectus of this paper. The Tribune is now
considered the most bold and fearless paper of the
Northwest, and even these who do not like the
principles which it' advocates, are constrained to
admit'that the fearlessness which characterizes it
is most admirable. Its commercial department is
unexceptionable, and recommends itself to all
business men.
[From the Lincoln (III.) Herald.]
The Chicago Tribune. —We are in receipt of the
Dairy Chicago Tribune, it is a journal unlike
many others is one mpect—it speaks Us mind
honestly and finely on. all questions concerning the
war. Some denounce-it for this. We do not .It
is me it ntters sentiments, at times, which we
dislike, but a little waiting and thinking brings
the Tribune out right in the end. It strikes
big strokes ;:lcoks in the distance to see where
they will fall; and, as it uniformly proceeds upon
principle, justice, and a wise policy, makes tem
poral enemies and thousands of truefrieuda. In &

Setting the Contraband* at Work. •
[Hilton Head Correspondence, Dec. 7-1
Jt has heen determined by Gfih. Sherman to.
appoint an agent to , collect and-store the cot- 1
ton, now-lying loose in such immense tjuanu
. ties on the various .deserted plantations on
fiiis «iTid the neighboring islands. That which
atm remains unpicked will , also he gathered
and packed, and in -this work are
to be employed- JA. double purpose will thus
be answered: the valuable commodity, in
whose security the world is interested, will be
obtained, and the inflammable material, out
of which some propose to manufacture a ser
vile insurrection, will be put to a much more
advantageous use. The negroes, while pick
ing and storing cotton, will be workingagainst
the rebellion, quite as effectively as ifbuniing
their master’s houses, and shooting their mas
ters themselves Indiscriminately; and at the
same time, the danger ofdividing Northern sen
timent will not be increased. The blacks arc to
be paid for their labor on proper vouchers, and
the cotton is to be shipped to the Quarter
master-General at New York, and sold by him
on public account. Lieut. ,Col. Nobles, late
commanding the N. Y. ©th regiment, but who
has within a few days, resigned his commis
sion,-has been appointed to superintend this
important work. He is fitted for it, by his
previous life, part of which has been spent at
the South among the negroes and in the cot
ton country. It is believed that cotton worth
from a million to a million and a half of
of money, can be immediately procured in
this vicinity. Mr. Nobles has already begun the
initiatory* preparations for his. important en
terprise, and set out to-day for St. Helena
Island. He may perhaps be unable to accom
plish as much as he desires, as the rebels are
burning or burying cotton as fast as they can,
returning often in small squads at night to the
places where Federal forces have visited du
ring the day. -As, however, reinforcements are
expected to arrive here to-day, it will be in
the power of the commanding General to make
such a disposition of the troops as will pre
vent in future these returns. Nobles will
take with him a large enough force to secure
himself against any interruption.
Tiie Condition of Kansas*
[From the Leavenworth Conservative, Bth.]
Kansas has already sent six thousand men to
fight the battles of the Union, and her mate
rial prosperity attests the value - of that sacri
fice. On all sides of us wc sec prosperity and
success. The farmer gets an increased price
for his productions; the mechanic is kept in
constant employment, and the State receives
a forwiird impulse from the influx of money
and the stimulation given to every branch of
business. There is more money intheStatc to
day than everbefore. A favorable seasonhasgiv
en us luxuriant harvest. Farmers are blessed
with full granaries and only ask for higher
prices and an absent foe. The Government is
expending millions of dollars here in buying
supplies, and the producerwho can wait a few
months before selling will realize high, prices
for his crops. Kansas only asks that the in
vader be kept from her. No State is more
prosperous to-day.
Scarcity of Coin In the South,
The scarcity of coin is general throughout
the South. People who have it have hoarded
it. In New Orleans, silver is at a premium of
40 and gold at 50 cents. Brokers would hand
out a hundred dollars In coin for $l5O in Ten
nessee money, while the Confederate bonds
were held at a greater discount than the Issues
of the banks. No change was ever given for
bank notes. Buy a half dollar’s worth of
stuff in the market, and the change was inva
riably made iu tickets.
■While seated in the saloon of the “South
ern Coffee House,” in Nashville, three soldiers
entered and called for the drinks (at a_ dime
each), and presented a dollar bill in payment.
He was handed seventy* cents -in checks or
tickets. The soldlcrdemurred,and demanded
the change; the checks, he said, would be of
no use to him, as he was immediately going
into camp. The barkeeper, however, was ob
durate. “Well,” said the soldier, “give me
back the bill, and by G— Til take pills and
throw up all Fve drank right here.” Bat
this proposition was not acceded to, and he
left with the tickets in his pocket.
The Sawyer Projectiles.
Messrs. S. and A. M. Sawyer, of Fitchburgh,
recently received a Government order for up
ward of seven thousand of their shell, case
shot, and canister, also a foil park oi rifled
cannon, two five-inch guns, of the navy
model, and four 2-4-poundcrs for fortifications.
These arms and munitions are being prepared
for Gtn. Butler’s command. The park of
eight cannon are being manufactured by the
Putnam Machine Company of Fitchburgh,
upon a plan of the Sawvers, expressly for use
of their projectiles, it consists of six 6-
pounders, aud two 12-poundcrs. They are
rifled guns, made of line cast steel, forged at
the well-known Firth Foundry in England.
Three of them arc finished, and we "much
doubt if anything of the kind can be found at
home or abroad, which can compare with
them in excellence and beauty of workman

JQITHBIDGE’S XX FLINT
GLASS OVAL
CARBON OIL LAMP CHIMNEYS.
The best that have evoryet been Offered to the public.
They are the beat for the following reasons;
I.—Because, being of an oval shape, the glass Is every*
where equally distant from the Same, so that tbe draft
Is stronger and more regular.
2.—The oval shape Is better adapted to resist the
effect of sudden expansion, to that it la Impossible to
crack them.
S.— I The glass is made largely of Lead and Pearlash,
givings great degree of strength and elasticity. ThO
chimneys which nousekeepershave found to be so brit
tle as to crack even when not in use, are Invariably
made of Lime Glas. instead of the Flint Glass, of
which ours arc manufactured.
Maanfjcturers and consumers of Carbou OH, who
have felt the magnitude of the obstacle which has .ex
isted la the great expense of chlmnevs, In the way of
tbe universal use of them, have found a remedy in the
Oval SS Flint Close Chimneys, which has materially
lessened the cost of Carbon Oil Light to those who use
them, and increased tbc consumption of oil consequent
upon the lessened expense for chimneys.
