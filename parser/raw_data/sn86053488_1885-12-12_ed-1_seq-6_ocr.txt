WHAT DOES IT PORTEND?
Troop Being Concentrated Westward,
' Their Destination Presumably Salt Lake
' City, Where Serious Trouble is Said to be
lire wing The Mormons Clamoring for
Blood AtonementThey May Get It.
Omaha, Neb., December 6. At an
early hour yesterday morning General
Howard, commanding the Department of
the Platte, received orders to send troops
from Fort Omaha to some point which ho
refuses to make public. Artillery bat
teries B and C, Fifth Artillery, were ac
cordingly ordered out and left yesterday
afternoon on a special train for the Wesf
over the Union Pacific. It is understood
that all the remaining troops at Fort
Omahn, consisting of ten companies of
infantry and one of cavalry, have been put
under orders to be ready to move
at a moment's notice. Inquiry at
Union Pacific headquarters reveals the
fact that the company has received
instructions to have in immediate
readiness additional special trains for the
movement of those troops westward.
General Howard has persistently refused
to answer questions regarding the des
tination of these troops. "My orders are
strictly confidential, " said General How
ard to your correspondent, "and I can
hot possibly even intimate wlrcrc these
troops are going. It is of the utmost
Importance that the people of the com
munity to which they are destined shall
not be apprised of their coming." It is
evident that serious trouble Is anticipated
somewhere. General Howard Intimated
as much.
The general conclusion is that the
tfoops of the department arc all to be
rapidly concentrated at halt Lake, in an
ticipation of un attack upon the Gentiles
by the Mormons. Trouble of serious
nature has been brewing there for the last
few days. The arrest, conviction and
imprisoment of Mormon leaders foi
polygamy have not only aroused the Mor
mons to great indignation and revengeful
bitterness, but have caused them to re
taliate by importing prostitutes from Sun
Francisco and Denver nnu using tnese
women to entrap Federal ofllclals and
prominent Gentiles. In this they have
been partly successful, having caused a
few arrests of the officials and Gentiles.
One Deputy United States Mar-
hal was arrested for fornication
with one of these women, under
the city charter. He was takeu
ly a writ of habeas corpus by the United
States authorities, who declared the city
mlinance invalid, because it exceeded
the authority granted by the Legislature.
The other night another Deputy- Marshal
was assaulted by what he called four
Mormon assassins) one of whom he dan
gerously shot. The Mormons and their
papers denounce this shooting as the act
of an assassin, who made the first assault,
and the Mormon press Is calling for blood
atonement. These are the causes that
make Salt Lake a volcano to-day, liable
to break forth at any moment. Threats
have been made that the entire Gentile
population will be cleaned out and excite
ment and fears are Increasing from clay to
day.
A dispatch received in umana iroin
Salt Lake, in response to a telegram of
Inquiry, says,: "The inflamed condition
of the public mind here is causing 1,101
serious nitre hensions. and the move
ment of the military is designed to pre
rent the possibility of un outbreak and
secure In advance the preservation of life
and properly. Troops cannot be concen
trated here any too quick to allay the
ilarm and excitement."
Owing to General Howard's reticence
regarding the destination of troops there
s eons derail c speculation as to wnere
Ihey are really going, buf the great ma
jority believe Salt Lake is the place with
out doubt. Their destination is alleged
dv the officer to be Fort Fred Steele, in
IVvoinlmr. on the Union Pacific. Others-
intimate that it is Fort Lewis, in South
em Colorado, where there have been some
disturbances among the Indians, and also
among Apaches some distance from that
post. " General Sheridan it is stated, de
sired to concentrate a large number of
troops at that point to handle any serious
autbrenk which mlirht take place In the
Southwestern country.
Another guess is that troops are needed
for labor troubles at Rawlins, Bock
Snrimis and Evanston on the Union Pa
cific, but railroad officials deny anything
of the kind. It is also hinted that the
troops are to go to the Pacific coast on
account of Chinese troubles. So far as
Indian troubles are concerned it is not at
all likely that artillery would be forward
ed. The sending out of the artillery con-
firms the general belief that Salt Lake is
the destination or place ol concentration
The troops at Fort Robinson, Neb., have
been ordered to move to the West, and
orders of similar character have been Is
sued to other posts in this department.
Latkr. It is a sure thing uow that th
troops from this department are going to
Salt Luke, aud it is understood from
(rood authority that trouble Is looked for
there.

NATURAL GAS.
Terrible Wreck ami Probable Loss of Two
Human Lives Ily an Kxploxloo. of the In
sidious Element in PittsburghThree
. Houses Wrecked and Several Persons In
jured Hy Falling Debris.
Pittsburgh, Pa., December 5. Yes
terday morning at four o'clock a natural
gas explosion, with probably fatal results
and destroying much property, occurred
at 545 Grant street, In the cellar of a
house occupied by J. Median.' Almost
simultaneously a similar explosion, ac
companied by tremendous reports, oc
curred in the adjoining cellars of Louis
Favilla, a fruit dealer, and J. J. Flan-
nery's livery stable and undertaking
rooms. There is a six-inch main running
along Grand street, but It had no connec
tions with the houses that suffered, ine
gas probably escaped irom tne mnn
and found its way to the cellars. Shortly
after four o'clock Katie Griffin, a domes
tic employed by Mrs. Median, started In
to the cellar for coal, taking with her a
lighted lamp. At the celjar doof she re
quested Mrs. Fhtpps, who was In the
room, to hold the lamp. No sooner had
she opened the door than the gas rushed
out and Ignited from the lamp in Mrs.
Plilpps hands. A terrific explosion en-
ued, followed in quick succession by ex
plosions in the cellars of Flannery and
Favilla. The noise was heard for squares
Away, and created the most intense ex
citement. Sheets of flames burst from
the windows and doors of the wrecked
houses. From within came the screams
of the terrified women and children.
A HORRIBLE SIGHT.
Several men worked their way through
the fire into Mrs. Median's house, where
a terrible sight met their gaze. Prone
upon the floor, with every vestige of
clothes burned frtfm her body, lay Kate
Griffin, bleeding from a gash in her side.
Near her was Mrs. Philips, wrapped In
flames. Both Vomcn were picked up
and carried from the burning build
ing. It was found that Kate Grif
fin was burned beyond all hopes of
recovery. She was removed to the
Hon; ipathic Hospital, where she now
is lying unconscious. Mrs. Phipps is se-
erely burned, but her injuries are not
considered fatal. On the upper flooi
of Mrs. Median's house were eight
women and children; in Flau
nery's, Mrs. Flannery and two
babies, and in Favilla's Mrs.
Favilla and her nephew, J. h. Case.
The lire spread so rapidly that they were
. i t.i -n m 11
escueu wiui uiuicuuy, out uu were
finally taken out uninjured except Mrs.
Flavilla and young Case, who were quite
seriously hurt by falling debris. Mean
while the flames gained such headway
that the three-story brick building was
completely destroyed. The other houses
were not entirely burned, but were so
badly wrecked by the concusmon that It
will probably be necessary to tear them
down. The news of the casualty in a few
minutes caused the streets to be black
with people struggling to get neai
the scene and learn the exact results. The
wildest rumors prevailed. It was first
stated that seventeen persons had been
killed and injured, but when it was
definitely ascertained that the victims
seriously hurt numbered only two the ex
citement gradually subsided and the throng
dispersed. A short distance from the
scene of the accident a faith-cure meeting
was in progress. The explosion shook,
the building and created a panic, but all
reached the street without Injury. The
loss wii! reach 830,000.
HERE'S A PRETTY MESSI
What the Strife Over Kolicrt Gnrrett'H Uuy
AVindow in Iliiltlinore is Likely to Itcsult
In A Millionaire's Kevenge -- It Comes
High. But lie Must Have It.
Baltimore, Md., December 4. The
bitter enmity which arose some months
ago between Robert Garrett, President ol
the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, and Mr.
Henry Janes, in regard to the portico
which Mr. Garrett has put on the front of
of his new house adjoininc the Jones
mansion, on Mt. Vernon Place, has
issumed a decidedly interesting phase.
Mr. Janes last summer applied for an in
junction against the completion of the
portico, ana gamed nis case, then Air.
Garrett took it to the Court of Appeals,
where it now is. During the post
twenty-four hours the residents
within the precincts of Mt. Vernon
Place, sacred tt society and the famous
sjroup of Barye statues, have been terror
stricken over a report that Mr. Janes had
said that in case the Court of Appeals
decided against him he would give his
house and grounds next door to Mr. Gar
rett's to a colored orphan asylum. The
property is worth about $150,000, but as
Mr. Janes is a millionaire and the part
ner of Mr. Enoch Pratt, who recently
gave the city over a million for a free cir
culating library, he will probably not suf
fer from want through his generosity.
Of course the wealthy Mt. Vernon people
are wild with anxiety, knowing that if Mr.
Janes should desire to wTesk such sum
mary vengeance on Mr. Garrett there
would be no law to prevent him.
WHOSE CHILD IS IT?
A Problem Requiring More Than the Wis
dom of Solomon to Solve An Outcome
oOthe Small-Pox Epidemle in Montreal.
Montreal, Can., December 4. Dr.
Laberge, Health Officer of this city, has
before hira one of the most difficult prob
lems which it has ever been the lot ol
man to solve. A little girl, two years old,
was to have been discharged from the
small-pox hospital yesterday, but during
the afternoon two women called aud each
being positive that the child was hers, the
nurses refused to give it to either. The
matter w as referred to Dr. Laberge, who
went with the warnen last night to see the
child, which Is very much disfigured, but
it was too young and had been too long
in the hospital to recognize Its mother.
Both women produced proofs of the mar
riage and the birth of children and the doc
tor being thorouehly bewildered advised
to take action in the courts. This after
noon another woman has put in a claim
for the child. The coi 'uslon has rcsuitetf
from several children having been buriet
without their parents having been notified.
