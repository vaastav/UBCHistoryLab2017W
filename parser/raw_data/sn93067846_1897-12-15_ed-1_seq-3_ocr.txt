Two Pointed Questions Answered
What is the use of making a better article
than your competitor if yon cac cot get a
helter price.for it?
Ans.-As there is no difference in the price
the public will bay only the better, so that
while oar profits may be smaller on a'single
sale they will be much greater ia tbe aggre?
gate.
How cao voa cet the public to know yoar
make is the best ?
If both articles ar? brought prominently
before the public both ere certain to be tried
sod the public will very quickly passjedg-.
meat on them and ose only the better one.
This explains the large sale on Chamber?
lain's Cough Remedy. The people have been
using it for rears and have foo nd that it cao
always be depended opon. They may occa?
sionally taie op with some fashionable
novelty put forth / with exaggerated claims,
bat are certain to return to the one remedy
that they know to be reliable, and for coogbt,

A stomach full of undigested food io about

What can be dorre with it?
There it stays. It won't digest. It churns
np, ferments and decays ; becomes poisonous
(as all putrid matter does) and causes great
pain and deep-seated disorders.
In order to change all tbis, take Shaker
Digestive Cordial.
It stops fermentation aod decay at once,
sc that no more poisons are ceated.
It clears tbe stomach o? poisons already
there It helps it to turn the food that re?

strengthens the stomach for the next meal.

M'KINLEY AND PEN?
SIONS.
The fact tbat President McKinley
said not a word about pensions io bis
message is taken in some quaters as an
indication that be does not intend to
encourage or tolerate tbe loose pension
policy which has prevailed under bis
Republican predecessors. The present
commissioner of pensions has been in?
dustri?os io bis efforts to swell the pen?
sion list. He has declared that there
are many men entitled to pensions who
have not com? forward aod claimed
them, and he advisees them to do so.
There may be here and there a veteran
who is witboat a pension who should
have one, bat for every such exception
thee is probably a score of pensioners
who sboald be dropped from tbe list.
General fl. Y. ?Boyotoo, a distin?
guished Union voe eran, io a recent news
jodtdartiole declares that the pension
rolls contain thousands of names which
were placed there by fraud, and that
a thorough purging of the list should
be undertaken at once.
After making a full investigation of
the matter General Boynton says :
"If tbe pension lists could be print?
ed, every oommunity io the land would
be disgusted with it revelations
Wealthy men in large numbers would
be found upon it. Thousands would
bejrevealed whose disabilities were only
temporary, aod BO loog since disappear?
ed. ? small army of meo would be
discovered to whom their pensioos are
to no sense a necessity. While this
state of facts would appear it should
not be forgotten that there are mea io
good circumstances, and macy in pub
lie positions of honor and emolument,
whose disabilities and persistent wounds
are of a character for which no
pension which the law pro?
vides can even approximately compen?
sate. At every step they have found
themselves handicapped in the battle of
life. For such, and indeed for all of
every rank sod position, through the
various grades and disabilities,'a pen?
sion is not as fully proportioned to the
needs and deserts of the oase as the
government can afford, but it is also a
badge of honor. To those who are not
thus incapacitated for foll effort in the
struggle of life, and who do not need
it because of the comfortable life which
they can command without it, a pen?
sion should be a badge of shame."
These ar* the words of a man who
distinguished himself as a soldier of
the Union and whose sympathies are
with all honest and deserving Federal
veterans. The sentiments and convic?
tions he thus expresses are held by
thousands of men who fought and suf?
fered in the Union army. Slocum and
General Rosecrans, when they were in
congress, frequently exposed pension
frauds and contended for stricter exami?
nations of the claims of those who were
already on the pension roll as well as
those who sought pensioos.
The horde of pension attorneys in
Washington and elsewhere are largely
responsible for thc prevalence of fraud
io the pension office. For the sake of
fees they trump op bogus evidence and
thereby pack the pension list with many
men who have no more claim upon tbe
government's gratitude and bounty
than the insurgents in the Phiilipine
Island -Atlanta Journal.

By Mt. Clio Grange for Set?
tling Liquor Problem.
Colombia, Dec 12- Since it bas
been known there is no chance what?
ever of the United States supreme
coort rendering a decision in the
matter of the right of citizens of
other States to sell liquor in this State
in original packages through agen?
cies, in time for the guidance of the
general assembly. Governor Ellerbe
has beeE receiving many suggestions
as to plans for the solution of the liquor
problem. The governor has announc
ed that be will devote the balk of his
message to tbe liquor question. Yes?
terday be received a letter conveying
resolutions adopted recently by the
Mt. Clio grange. The resolutions
suggest a plan for dealing with the
problem, which has not heretofore
been mentioned Tbe letter is as fol?
lows :
His Excellency, Governor Ellerbe,
Columbia, S. C. :
Sir : I herewith take the high
honor of enclosing preamble and reso?
lutions adopted by the Mt. Clio
Grange, $fo. 14, at a recent meeting
of said Grange at its hall. Your obe?
dient servant,
J. M. Smith, Secretary.
The resolutions read as follows:
Whereas, by the enactment of the
dispensary law in South Carolina a
long stride towards co-operation by
aH for all was made, and the allure?
ments to drink and temptation to con
tract debts for liquor offered by the
barroom system removed, and
Whereas, lhere are those who
through lack of education along social
Hoes and others who copy tho past
following precedent, and yet others,
a third class, who are by far the most
numerous and strongest of the three,
and who are materially interested, are
all consistently and systematically op?
posing the administration of the law,
therefore be it
Resolved, That we do hereby de?
clare in favor of the dispensary law
and hope that it will be allowed to
remain on the statue books of the
State. And as a meads to attain this
desired end we respectfully suggest
the following changes :
One. That a license tax of $5,000
be placed on all liquor selling estab?
lishments, local dispensaries includ?
ed.
Two. That the price of liquors sold
thtough the local dispensaries be re?
duced.
Three. That the general assembly
appropriate annually' to each of the
several counties of the State a sum of
money equaling the amount collected
annually from the dispensaries situ?
ated and doing business in each of
the several counties.
While euch suggestions are con?
stantly coming in to the governor,
the prohibitionists are going ahead and
thoroughly organizing throughout
the State. They intend to see that
their prohibition measure that is now
pending before the legislature is
rushed to a vote at the coming ses?
sion. They are very hopeful of win?
ning.
It has been determined to raise up an
ambidextrous generation in the state
Noevo Leon, Mezieo, and the govern*
ment bas ordered that the pupils in all
the official schools shall be taught to
write and perform all manat? tasks as
well with the left band as with the
right.
Governor Northen is being charged
with a genuine Irish boll It is
claimed that 'in his speech at the
Atlanta exposition he trusted the oc?
casion would prove "the entering
wedge which would bring about a
more perfect unity between the north
and south " The Philadelphia Press
says this is matched by Sir Boyle
Koche, who recently said in speaking
of England and Ireland that he "was
an enemy of both kingdoms who
wishes to diminish the brotherly af
fections of the two sister countries.

THE
Weather
DID IT!
In making our contract for Blankets, whick
we did in June we failed to consult the
weather man, so that the mild Fall we have
had has beaten us and left us with just
34 pairs
Tar Heel Blankets,
On hand which we do not care to carry another season, for two
reasons, the first of which is we need money, and the second,
it is hard to keep them clean and free of moths, and for these
reasons we have determined to dispose of them, even at, a loss
to us, and will make the price as long as they last'
$2.85 per pair.
Don't be surprised if you should call in a few
days and find them all gone.
Another item in our stock that has not moved as rapidly as
we would wish, is
Children's Jackets?
We have picked out 31, sizes 4 to 10 years that we have been,
selling at $1.50, $2 and $2.50, and. make a round price of
$ 1 . 1 5o
This is the greatest opportunity offered this
season of making your child" comfortable for
little money.
