The Next Speaker of the Lower House Gives Reasons
for Republican Defeat and Tells What Democrats
Expect to Do in the Way of Legislation During the
Present Session of Congress.
Washington, D. C.,7Xec. 6.— Champ
Clark, who probably will be the next
speaker of the house, was today ask
ed to answer several questions and
his replies follow:
Question I. — What cause or causes
chiefly brought about the republican
defeat? Was the cause of high liv
ing the most pertinent cause?
Answer—On July 5. 1910, I wrote
an elaborate interview in which I pre
dicted a democratic victory in Nov
ember. 1 then stated the cause of
the democratic victory, in which I
predicted these things:
First, the enormous ani abnormal
majority of the popular vote which
the president received, which bred
deniorrlization among republicans as
certainly as the rivers seek the sea.
Second, the fight in the house over
Ihe rules, which split the republicans
Into two bitterly warring factions.
Third, the widespread dissatisfac
tion with Fresident Taft's administra
tion.
Fourth, the almost universal dis
satisfaction and disgust with the
Payne-Aldrich-Smoot tariff bill.
Prediction Came True.
My predictions of July ,">th was
fulfilled literally on November Sth.
and I believe was fulfilled for the rea
sons set fnnh in the July Interview.
Of course, minor causes operated here
and there. Local disturbances, feuds
among republicans about postoffices
and other items of patronage, helped
us somewhat. The high cost of living
aided us largely, and the voters at
tributed it partly, at least, to the
tariff.
Question 2. —What should the de
mocrats now do to retain their suc
cess?
Answer —In order to retain their
success demorcats should religiously,
so far as in them lies, carry out the
promises made in order to win the
election. No other rules of conduct
will do to live by. and no man or
party can long hold power that does
not live by it. The people are entitl
ed to that square deal of which we
hear so much and see so little.
Question 3. —If the democratic
party should be conservative rather
than progressive, what would be the
result to that party?
Answer —The words "conservative"
and "progressive" as used in the pub
lications, speeches and conversation
or* our day are rather hazy in
ing and need a digram to explain*
them. Surely "coniervative," as ap
plied to anybody except standpat re
publicans, does not mean that a man
or a party shall occupy forever the
same position on all questions as un
chanseuble in their opinions as the
k Modes and the Persians were in their
r iaws. Shuuld the democrats perform
such a idiotic caper as that? This is
incredible —they would not only b*
relegated to their wanderings in the
wilderness, but would richly deserve
in be so relegated. But Ido not be
lieve they will be so relegated for the
all-sufficient reason that I donot be
lieve that they will play the fool in
any such manner as their enemies de
sire.
Uses of Adversity.
Shakespeare says: "Sweet are
the uses of adversity." That may or
may not be true; but surely demo
crats have had enough experience in
the hard school of adversity to learn
something—indeed, to learn a good
deal.
On the other hand, surely to be
a ' progressive" does not import that
a man or party shall be continually
changing solely for the sake of the
change and making what Benjamin
Disraeli once described as "a leap in
the dark." Certainly for a man or
a party to be "progressive" does not
mean that he or it shall advocate
every fad in legislation that is sug
gested.
What Should Control
A desire to promote the honor and
welfare of the country and not a
r-iere desire for change because it is
' a change, should animate and con
trol us in all we do, as well as in
all we refuse to do. 1 have no sort
of doubt that we will progress grad
ually, cautiously, wisely and trium
phantly. So far as 1 have been able
to ascertain there is uo earthly rea
son why a man or party should not
be simultaneously both conservative
and progressive. In fact, all legis
lation should be on lines of justice,
common sense and enlightened patri
otism.
Question 4 —Do you think the fact
that all the most militant, progress
ive of insurgent republican leaders
in the last congress, like Cummins of
lowa, La Follette of Wisconsin. Clapp
of Minnesota. Bristow of Kansas,
have been sustained at the polls,
while in almost every case the stand
patters have suffered indicates that
the country is ready for and expects
progressive legislation for the con
trol of corporations? Will progress
ive policies necessarily disturb or
harm legitimate business?
Answer—Most of your question
four I answered under tfie head of
question three. i>uch "progressive"
policies as I described ii. No. 3 not
only will not harm legitimate busi
ness, but will help it. That any sane
man desires to injure any legitimate
business is absolutely inconceivable.
A sane man wishes to promote every
legitimate business because the wel
fare and happiness of the people de
pend very largely, if not entirely,
upon the growth and prosperity of
legitimate business, large and small
The talk about t desire to injure
legitimate business is the malicious
jabber of standpatters—"a tale told
b yan idiot, full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing —except that the
man who talks it is of the tribe of
Ananias and Sapphira.
So far as the feud between the
standpat and insurgent republicans
is concerned that is a family fight,
a performance for which 1 have no
taste. I interfered in a family row
once, when in my salad days, and
every time I think of it I humbly
and reverently thank Heaven that
I am still alive.
If the fact that certain insurgents,
such as La Follette, Murdoch and
Poindexter won shows that insurg
ensy is growin, by the same token
does not the fact that Beveridge,
Burkett and Fowler lost show that
insurgency is waning?
It is not wise, according to Lord
Bacon, to undertake to deduce a
general rule from too few instances.
Whether the insurgents will swal
low the standpatters or tho stand-
Patters will swallow the insurgents,
whether the throrough trouncing
they all got will bring them togeth
er or separate them more widey, can
not be predicted with anything ap
proximating certainty. They have
my hearty wishes for a permanent
and wider separation, the more per
manent and wider the better for the
country.
Question s—How do you regard
the result of the last, election as a
whole? As a victory for the pro
gressives or insurgents, or as an out
come regardless of parties?
Answer— I regard the result of the
last election as a sweeping democrat
ic victory, giving us a golden oppor
tunity and imposing upon us a grave
responsibility.
Question 6—Do you regard the
re-election of those who were pro
gressives or insurgents in the last
session as a republican victory?
Answer —I regard the selection of
any sort of a republican to any sort
of an office as a republican victory
pro tante. There is no use to mul
tiply words in answering "No.".
Question 7 —Are you in favor of
taking up in the presene session a
revision of the Payne-Aldrich wool
and cotton schedules, or do you
think it would be preferable to take
up a general tariff revision at the
presene session and if so. could this
be done, in your opinion, without
disturbing commercial interests in
general?
Answer—Unquestionably the cot
ton and wool schedules need revis
ion; so do the other schedules, some
more, some less. Whether any re
vision will be attempted at the short
session, in which there are only

IS SATISFIED
WITH APPLE
SHOW
G. C. Corbaley Says Attend
ance Was Good After
First Two Days.
G. C. Corbaley. one of the trustees
of the National Apple Show and
whose business keeps him in this
city much of the time, stated today
that the trustees of the show and the
business men of Spokane are much
pleased with the success of the Chi
cago exhibition held at the First Reg
iment Armory.
He explains how the first reports
were very discouraging. During the
first two days of the show the wea
ther was very stormy and attendance
exceedingly light. A total exceeding
.">O,OOO admissions for the secen days
is? considered very satisfactory and
fully up to the expectations of the
promoters.
The net loss on the Chicago exhi
bition will run about $5,000, accord
ing to Mr. Corbaley's estimate. This
is no greater than was anticipated
and will be met by the business men
of Spokane. A little extra effort
to raise this money is feared an ac
count of the fact that th* benefits
to Spokane from a show held in Chi
cago are not so apparent as from
one held in the home city where the
money of visitors is spent in local
stores and hotels instead of those in
the big, selfish city far away.
11 FUNERAL II
DETERMINED
Definite Arrangements Wiii
Not Be Completed
Until Tomorrow.
Boston, Mass.. Dec. 6.—The final
arrangements for the funeral of Mrs.
Mary Baker Eddy, head of the Chris
tian Science church, will not be per
fected until the arrival of her son,
George W. Glover, from South Dako
ta sometime tomorrow.
It was decided today that the body

cemetery, Cambridge. At the man
sion at Chesterhill, where the body
lies in the upper chamber, there is
no outward signs of grief, no crepe
on the door, window shades all up.
and the members of the household
come and go as usual.
$300,000 FOR A RANCH
Mcdford Fruit Land Brings $1200
An Acre.
Medford, Ore., Dec. 6.—The Bear
Creek orchards, one of the finest or
chard tracts in the Rogue river val
ley, was sold today to Samuel Rosen
burg of Seattle for $300,000.
The orchard contains 237 acres,
all of which is planted to fruit,
about 175 acres in pears and the rest
in apples. The price averaged more
than $1200 an acre. The sale was
made: through John D. Olwell for a
syndicate composed of Messrs. Wal
ter, Olwell, Clark and Myers. Mr.
Rosenburg is a merchant and hotel
keeper in Seattle.
Great Display of Orchard Products.
Minneapolis, Minn., Dec. 6. —The
possibilities of fruit growing in this
section of the country are strikingly
illustrated in a great display of or
chard and garden products, which
opened in Minneapolis today in con
junction with the 4 4th annual meet
ing of the Minnesota State Horticul
tural society. Included in the dis
play are many choice exhibits of
fruits grown in Minnesota, northern
lowa, western Wisconsin, North and
South Dakota and Manitoba.

HOLM REMOVES 10
EPHRATA
Will Devote Attention to
Development and Sale of
Reard Tract.
R. F. Holm has virtually severed
his connection with the realty busi
ness of Holm, Weils & Nichols. The
first of the month he will move his
family to Ephrata and devote his en
tire time and attention to the devel
opment and sale of the Reard tract
of 400 acres. He has secured ex
clusive ownership of this valuable
proper'v and will concentrate his
large ability to making this enter
prise a success.
Mr. Holm has been one of the
prominent, citizens of Wenatchee for
many years and has been identified
with nearly all various boosting en
terprises responsible for the remark
able transformation of Wenatchee
from a rapped villr.gp to the most
prosperous city of twice its size in
the northwest.
During the last session of the leg
islature he worked incessantly for
this city and valley. That the bridge
bill, which was carried as the result
of his indefatigible labors, has miss
ed fire is no fault of Representative
Holm.
The development of the Ephrata
and Moses Lake section is closely
identified with the interest of many
citizens of Wenatchee. The enter
prise and ability of Mr. Holm will
therefore continue to be expended to
a large degree for the ultimate bene
fit of the Wenatchee country, and
Ephrata will receive the impetus of
one of the best citizens and boost
ers in the state.

Ask Wenatchee to Join
in Movement.
Fruitgrowers of the Wenatchee
valley will be interested in the fol
lowing letter, received here by P. P.
Ilolcomb. president of the Wenatchee
Valley Fruit Growers association.
The document is self explanatory:
Medford, Ore.. Nov. 28. 1910.
Mr. P. P. Holcomb, President,
Wenatchee, Wash.
Dear Sir: The board of directors
of this association, at their last
meeting, expressed themselves as be
ing of the opinion that the time is
ripe lor the formation of a central
marketing organization that would
distribute the output of apples of all
associations in the northwest.
I am writing you officially to say
that we should like, if possible, to
arrange a conference between rep
resentatives of all the associations in
the entire northwest to consider the
advisability of this move. Without
going into the matter, we presume
the experience of Wenatchee in dis
tributing the crop of this year is
sufficient to indicate to your valley
the need of an organization that can
scientifically and accurately distrib
ute the fruit products of the north
west. We should be pleased to hear
from you in regard to this matter
and should like to have you bring
it before the board of directors of
your association and secure from
them some expression in regard to
it.

Holders of Notes to Bring
Them to Next Meeting.
At the noon day luncheon today
of the Commercial Club, about sev

King announced that the club is mak
ing a guarantee of at least 100 plates
for each of these Tuesday luncheons,
and that number will need to be
present each week if ihis custom is
continued.
flub Pars Debts.
It was announced that at the next
regular meeting on Monday evening
the club will be prepared to pay $500
on its debts, besides all the interest
now due on outstanding notes. No
tice has been served co these credit
ors to bring their notes next Mon
day evening. Each of them will be
numbered and these numbers will
be written on slips of paper and
shaken up in a hot. The first ten.
taken at random from the hat will
be paid in full. In January anoth
er $500 will be paid in the same
manner, thus in the near future al!
the obligations outside of the mort
gage on the building, will have been
lifted.
Good Ho uls < onvention.
Dr. Stevenson wah asked to tell
about, how the Good Roads conven
tion was secured for Wenatchee next
year. He described the hustling
done by the Wenatchee delegates in
the way of printing and distributing
ribbons and cards, the speeches
made by Dr. King and others. There
was no enthusisasm in the conven
tion regarding giving Tacoma the
honor. The motion nominating Ta
coma did not receive a second for
at least six minute:-;. In the opin
ion of the speaker, it would be no
honor for any* city to hold such a
convention as the one at Walla Wal
la. It was marked by confusion and
dissent ion. Wenatchee should be at
work to outline a program for next
year such as will result in a harmon
ious and enthusiastic convention.
Secretary Coburn stated that the
Wenatchee delegates were material
ly assisted by the editors who were
present here this fall at the State
Press Associaiton convention. They
spoke in the highest terms of We
natchee's hospitality and facilities.
About 1000 delegates are expect
ed to attend this convention and each
one of them will spend on an aver
age of $10. This means $10,000 to
Wenatchee as the result of this one
stroke of enterprise. This is the
third of the state organizations which
have selected Wenatchee for state
conventions.
Editors Delighted.
Secretary Coburn read excerpts
from newspaper mention of editors
acknowledging the receipt of apples
sent to them by the Wenatchee Com
mercial Club on Thanksgiving even
ing. Some sixty of the complimen
tary write-ups were given Wenatchee
as a result of this courtesy on the
part of the commercial club. A box
of Jonathans were sent to each of
these editors who attended the State
Press Association last fall.
Publicity Books.
Copies of the new publicity books
were given out for the first time at
the luncheon today. The supply was
small and it is anounced that there
will be more of the books available
for distribution at the regular meet
ing on Monday night.
A large supply of the new maps
of the state railroad commission were
announced to be on hand for free
distribution at the office of the sec
retary. These are large and show
the very latest operations of the rail
way surveys.
Committees Announced
President King announced the ap
pointment of two committees. Fred
Crollard is chairman of the new ban
quet committee, and H. N. May of
the state capital committee.
J. B. Bixler. the photographer, re

MESSAGE 10 HESS
Reading Began Shortly After Noon and Owing to Kk
treme Length Many Members Absented Themselves
From Chambers—National Legislators Believe There
is Little Chance for Passage of Taft's Pet Measures.
Washington, I) .C., Dec. 6.—Congress gave respectful
attention to President Taft's message but comparatively
few members are willing to concede the probabilities of
favorable action at the present session on many of the
recommendations contained therein. This was in view
of the fact that the session will close on March 4.
The message was delivered to both houses by Secretary
Latta soon after noon. The reading of the document,
which was of unusual length, was begun at 12:19 in the
senate. At first there was the most attention, but grad
ually this attention ceased on the part of most of them
and those who remained in the chamber devoted them
selves to printed copies before them. This was also the
case in the house.
President Taft said in part:
CENSUS RETURNS
AID DEMOCRATS
Congressional Redistricting
to Be Done by Leg
islatures.
Washington, Dec. 6. —With an in
crease of from s'» to *75 members of
the House of Representatives indi
cated by the census returns, the pres
ent House is beginning to wonder
just how to handle the reapportion
ment proposition.
Under rhe present basis of repre
sentation —one representative for
every 1 !"♦:>, 167 inhabitants —the new
house would have about 473 mem
bers, if the census officials* estimate
of a total population of amout 92,-
--000.nno is right.
An assembly of this size would be
too unwieldy, however, according to
many prominent statesmen, for vari
ous reasons. The question of getting
more representatives in the present
chamber would tax the ingenuity of
all architects. It was necessary to
remodel the chamber after the reap
portionment of 1900, when 35 mem
bers were added, and at that time
the chamber was extended to just as
large a size as was possible. There
are now 4t>o seats. It is barely pos
sible that a reapportionment measure
will be passed at this session of
Congress, but the democrats will en
deavor to delay it until they are in
control.
They will then be able to dictate
the basis of representation, which will
undoubtedly be increased. The sug
gestion has been made that the ra
tio be increased so as to maintain the
house at its present size. 391. If
this is done, it is certain that sev
eral states will lose one or two rep
resentatives.
The democrats arc certain to pro
fit by the reapportionment. What
ever course is pursued for the redis
tricting of the states will be done by
the legislatures, and the democrats
arc in control in many of the states
heretofore solidly republican.

To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives:
During the past year the foreign
relations of the United S»ate* have
continued upon a basis of friendship
and good understanding.
Arbitration
The year has been notable as wit
nessing the pacific settlement of two
important international controversies
before the Permanent Court of the
Hague.
The arbitration of the fisheries dis
pute between the United States and
Great Britain which has been the
source of nearly continous diploma
tic correspondence since the fisheries
convention of 1818 has given an
award which is satisfactory to both
parties. This arbitration is particu
larly noteworthy not only because of
the eminently just results secured,
but also because it is the first arbi
tration held under the general arbi
tration treaty of ApriH, 190$. be
tween the United States and Great
Britian. and disposes of a controversy
the settlement of which has resisted
every other resource of diplomacy
and which for nearly ninety years has
been the cause of friction between the
two countries whose common inter
est lies in maintaining the most
friendly relations with each other.
Pe:tce Commission
Appreciating the enlightened ten
dencies of modern times, the congress
at its last session passed a law provid
ing for the appointment of a com
mission of five members (to be ap
pointed by the president of the Uni
ted States ) to consider the expediency
of utilizing existing international ag
encies for the purpose of limiting tno
armaments of the nations of tho
world by international agreement and
of constituting the combined navies
of the world an international fovea
for the preservation of universal
peace, and to consider and report on
any other means to diminish the ex
penses of government for military
purposes and to lessen the proba
bilities of war.
I have not as yet made appoint
ments to this commission because I
have invited and am awaiting the ex
pressions of foreign governments aa
to their willingness to co-operate with
us in the appointment of similar com
missions or representatives who
would meet with ours and by joint ac
tion seek to make their work
Tariff Negotiations
The new tariff law, in section two
respecting the maximum and mini
mum tariffs of the United States
which provisions came into effect oa
April 1. 1910, imposed upon the pres
ident the responsibility of determin
ing prior to that date whether or not
any undue discrimination existed
against the United States and its pro
ducts in any country of the world
with which we had commercial rela
tions.
In the case of several nations in
stances of apparent undue discrimi
nation against American commerce
were found to exist. These discrimi
nations were removed by negotiation.
Prior to April 1. 1910, when the max
imum tariff was to come into opera
tion with respect to exportation from
all those countries in whose favor no
proclamation applying the minimum
tariff should be issued by the presi
dent one hundred and thirty-four
such proclamations were issued. This
series of proclamations embraced the
