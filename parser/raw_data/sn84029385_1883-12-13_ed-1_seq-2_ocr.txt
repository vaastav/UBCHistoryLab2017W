But their hope' are all a dream:
For they've read the glittering- banner,
And their heads are bending low;
They have heard the awful sentence:
Tho Republicans must go.
. Their stars which glittered brightly
Along the starry route
Have raised tho cry: "surrenderl"
We'll turn the rascals out.
For they've gambled In high places,
And their record well we know;
Turn them back around behind us;
Turn them out and let them go.
Their bloody shirt is fading,
And they're groping now alone;
Virginia crushed their Southern hopes;
They have lost their brave Muhone.
They've failed to roidjust tho South;
They have no heart to crow;
Their bose3 now concede the fact
The party sure must go.
Postmasters sigh along the route,
And strive to hold the guards,
But the Democrats have shown their hand;
They hold tho winning curds.
And as their ship of power goes down
They waver to and fro:
They bid their pals a fond adieu.
And with tho party go.
F. A. IVciiner, in Stanherru (3Io.) Sentinel.
The Raginf? Mahone.
The Associated Press, it seems, has
already begun the political campaign
for 18S1. On Saturday it sent out
printed slips of an inflammatory ad
dress issued by William Malione, as
Chairman of the Keadjuster party of
Virginia, carefully sub-headed and
marked "For use in Monday's Papers."
We have not observed that the Associat
ed Press hs taken the pains lo send out
the printed slips of any of the speeches
of Senator Iia3'ard, or of ex-Speaker
Randall, or of Senator "Wallace, or of
any representative Democrat, If Wil
liam Mahone's tirade against the Dem
ocrats of Virginia is legitimate news,
the speeches of the Democratic orators
are likewise.
A more atrocious and infamous cal
umny never was uttered against the
people than this same libel on the white
people of Virginia just published by
William Mahone and distributed by the
Associated Press. It is simply a lot of
groundless and unfounded slanders
strung together in turgid phrase and
repeated over and over again to the ex
tent of four dreary columns. It charges
systematic murder and intimidation by
the Democrats, and professes a wonder
ful admiration for the colored people on
the part of Mahone and his fellow-Re-adjusters.
But how easily this enraged
and unscrupulous slanderer is answered
and exposed?
William Mahone and his party at the
time of the late election had control of
the entire State Government of Vir
ginia. Mahone's creature, Cameron,
was then and is now the Governor of
tho State. Mahone's lacke-s fill the
judicial offices of the State and control
the administration ot justice. Mahone's
tools were the majority in the Election
Boards throughout the State. The Fed
eral offices are filled with men of Ma
hone's own choosing, and the whole
power of the Federal Government in
Virginia was virtually wielded by Ma
hone. How on earth comes it, then,
that the ciflues which Mahone now
charges upon his fellow Virginians were
not prevented, or if they could not be
prevented that no steps are being taken
by Malione and his party to bring the
alleged criminals to justice? Why is it
that Mahone fails to name one single
murderer or to specify one solitary case
of intimidation? Why is it that Ma
hone's Governor failed even to make an
effort to protect the Readjuster voters
from the violence of which this con
temptible slanderer now complains?
There has been but a single murder
trial in Virginia which grew out of the
recent political canvass. That trial re
sulted in the conviction of one of Will
iam Mahone's own peaceful and an
gelic Readjusters of the killing of a
straight-out Republican negro. How
comes it that Mr. Mahone's vivid im
agination and inflamed rhetoric fail to
describe the only political murder in
Virginia of which" Mr. Mahone's courts
bear record? The other night while a
Democratic jubilee was in progress at
the Virginia capital several Democratic
negro organizations from the surround
ing country were in attendance. What
happened then and there? Why,
gangs of Readjuster negroes, inflamed
by the bloody instructions of Mahone
and his co-conspirators against the
peace of the State, assembled and as
saulted the peaceful and inoffensive
members of their own race who had
! come to participate in the Democratic
jollification. Uus occurred in the Dem
ocratic stronghold of the State and right
under the nose of Mahone's Governor.
Does this indicate that the .Mahone ne
groes were intimidated? Does it not
rather prove that the intimidation
was on the part of the supporters of Ma-
, '., .. , . ', -., , y
moD, tnc nauirai outcome oi Manone s
inflammatory appoals to his ignorant
followers, is not even mentioned in the
address which the Readjuster slanderer
has seen fit to impose on the country
through the generous aid of the Asso
ciatcil Press. If anybody is deceived
, by the excited, fantastic but malignant
statements of this culminator of his own
people, he must be as egrfegious an ass
as Mahone is an unconscionable politi
cal scoundrel. Earrisburg (fa.) Put
triol. A Solid South.
i Mahone and
Mahoneism have sue-
ceeded in making the
South most de-
cidedlv solid, but
not for President
Arthur.
Mahone's tactics beget murder and
rioting and the South has had more than
enough of such things. The Virginia
boss s efforts to sejure his own elevation
and to benefit President Arthur have
resulted ;n a down'all that will redound
to the benefit of m crv t-outhern State.
The kind of politii-s that such men ns j
Mahone pra ;tieed in Virginia and loody
Fort Pillow Chalmers attempted to
practice in Mississippi is dangerous in
the extreme to the peace and prosperity
of any community in any State and es
pecially so in the South.
Virginians, as true Southern people,
have good reason to rejoice because they
have succeeded in knocking such
methods in the head beforethey ob
taiaed a foothold, in the South. They
hare shown moreover that they deem
a " solid South" much preferable to a
section divided by the methods of such
men as Mahone and Chalmers.
If the corrupt Republican party hope
or expect to divide tho South, they will
have to select better tools than those
they have used in the recent attempt
Ezclianrje.
Mahone's Downfall.
The country has become acquainted
with this adventurer. He has been a
notorious and powerful quantity in Fed
eral politics because of accidental cir
cumstances. He got himself elected to
the Senate as a Democrat, with a dif
ference Irom the main party in the
State on the debt question. They were
were Flinders. He was a Readjuster.
So many readers forget facts that it
will be well to explain these terms.
The Funders maintained that all the
dfbt of Virginia not assessable on
West Virginia, which was cut out of the
Old Dominion as a war measure
should be funded, and paid. It "was
$45,000,000. The Readjustee main
lined that Virginia should pay only
$30,000,000, on the plea that that wai
all she could afford really because the
repudiation of $15,000,000 was "popu
lar. n The repudiation was softened into
the term "readjusting." Falstafl
called stealing "conveying." Mahone
got 30,000 whites and 90,000 negroes tc
vote for "Readjustment." Against il
100,000 whites voted. Tho Republicat
party in Virginia combined with th
Mahone whites to make two minorities
form a majority. All the time, Ma
hone said that, on all Federal questions,
he was a Democrat. He ran an elector
al ticket in 1880. Only the whites witr
him voted it. The Funders ran electors
of their own. The Republicans did. so,
too. Both distrusted Mahone. The
Funders won by a plurality. The vote
of the State went for Hancock. In the
18S0 canvass, Mahone urged the Dem
cratic National Committee to get tht
Virginia Democrats to join with him it
the canvass. He said he was as good s
Hancock man as an- of them. At the
same time, he secretly visited Garfield
atMentor for the purpose of a fusioi
with him only to be repelled.
When the Senate met, March 4, 1881,
there were thirty-seven Democrats,
thirty-seven Republicans, and two non
descripts, David Davis and William
Mahone. The latter sent word to the
Democratic caucus that he would vote
with them if he could dictate his plac
ing on committees. The party refused

of a fellow repudiator, Rntdleberger, tc
be Sergeant-at-arms, dictated his plac
ing on committees-, and voted with thai
party. The negotiation was effected
by Vice-President Arthur. It was the
most dishonorable pact ever formed in
politics. Ever since then, by having
a casting vote in a tied Senate, Ma
hone has been the master of the Repub
lican column there. The murder oi
Garfield enabled Mahone to have the
same hold on the Executive that ha
had on the Senate. Since Arthur be
came President, Mahone has effected his
plan of repudiation for Virginia, and
had it declared inviolable by the Repub
lican Supreme Court of the United
States.
His course has been impressed on the
country. He has made his action in
Virginia that of an autocrat, with a pol
icy of larceny and tyranny. He grad
ually estranged every "considerable
leader who had led off with him. He
stung the honest Republican leaders in
to revolt. That left him only the men
without reputation among the whites
and the practiced scoundrels whe
worked on the fears and ignorance ol
the lower grade of blacks. After an
earnest struggle the Democrats have
united all the efficient honesty in the
State against him. It proved to be a
majority. The Legislature is against
him. He has yet two more years in the
Senate. His tool. Cameron, will be
Governor two years more; but that is
the limit of his power. This Legisla
lature chooses his successor. The State
has slipped away from him. His over
throw is the chief event for civilization
which has occurred in American poli
tics this year. It is a great rebuke to
; the Federal Administration. President
Arthur has sacrificed every principle ol
Civil-service reform to gorge Mahone
with patronage. He has reversed every
principle of Republicanism, as to honest
money, to sustain the Virginia repudia
tion. " He has condemned his Adminis
tration to dishonor in history by his Ma
honeism. Yet that utter badness is the
only affirmative and overt feature of the
Administration. Otherwise, it has been
a mere parasite on the spoils and in iti
action and policy, dull, commonplace
and tricky. Albany Argus.
Earning His Pay.
Mahone is equal to the emergency.
To revive the horrif ing stories of Bour
bon atrocities and strive to make a
solid North is his task. So he proceeds
to draw a startling picture of Bourbon
ruffianism. The Democrats of Virginia
are described as "screaming in threat
ening frenzy as fierce and Xcwildering
as the dance and song of the Carmag
nole in the days of the sans-culoUc."
Alas! We fear that with the raga
muffin followers of Mahone the "day3
of the sansc7doUc?, arc yet to come,
when the' lose the Federal pap upon
which they have recently fed.
Mahone is now seeking to earn his
pay from the Republicans by getting up
a cry of Southern Democratic persecu
tions and murders, as political capital
for the campaign of 1884.
What folly! The citizens of the
United States have intelligence. They
read the news and know the true condi
tion of the South. The negro popula
tion, respected when they behave them
selves, arc well treated by their white
fellow citizens. They are beginning tc 1
profit ny education and are acting more
and more every year in hannon' with
the whites in political matters. The
Mahoncs can mske no mischief of any
extent in the South. All the Republic
an press can not mislead the people of
the North tiny longer in regard to the
condition of the Southern States.
The next Presidential campaign will
not De fought under the banner of the
bloody-shirt. The dishonesty of Re
publican officials can no longer be
hidden under ghost stories about the
Ku-Klux Klan. The people arc not
fools. They know that the South is re
covering its prosperity, and that like
the rest of the country it onlr needs the
advantage, of economical gave -.Timent, a
cessation of t orrupt jobs and a decrease
of the public burdens to be restored
to its old position.
That
is why
in ihe
that is

whv it will find an allv in the Nort i de
spite the ravings of Mahone and the
ghost stories of the Republican press.
