%OMOGRAPHY OF THE TERR*TO
IMAL COUNCIL.
Lewiston, December 9'th, 1864
Ebrroa World : In ft former communication
Ï wrote you some facts in relation to the
'membersof the Lowef House of tlte Legisla
ture, from which you could obtakria homo
graphic chart. I now ^end you a similar
'account of the members of the Council, from
which yöu will see that, of the three tiiembers
holding over, two are Democrats. The Ooiin*
dl did itself considerable credit in deciding
' the contested election case on its merits ; that
' is, provided there was bo other *tnotive than
■to do justice—which l am not yet prepared
* to give them. *
HCX. S. B. DILLKY,
Representing Alturas and Oneida counties in
the Council, is a native of Ohio:; aged 31 :
merchant by profession ; single; been ; in the
Territory two .years—on this Coast, two years ;
'Douglas Democrat. He is one of the most
active members öf that btanch of the Legis
lature. He-is an accomplished presiding offi
• çer, and is often called to the Chair when in
' Committee of the Whole. He is a very esti
mable gentleman, and an able representative.
Term expires in<1866.
HOX. JOHN CUMMINS,
President,'of the Council, and representing
Owyhee county, is the youngest man in either
\House. Native of Indiana; 26 years of age;
unmarried; attorney; in the Territory one
. year, and on this coast eleven years; Union.
Cummins has served one term in the Oregon
^Legislature. Has experience enough, if he
htd force of character and firmness to rise
ubove petty party influences on matters of a
general nature even, to make a good repre-.
sedative. He is very attentive to his duties,
*tmt I think allows himself to be controlled by
DOCTOR EPHRAIM SMITH,
'One of the mis-represeutatives in the Council
from Boise county. The said Doctor E ,
''Smith opposes everything that lodk-s to
the interest of any jme, unless he is aboli
tionist, no difference of what importance it
' may be to the people at large. Narrow mind
ed, egotistic himself, he traduces, by turns,
both friends and foes, as he may be behind
1 heir backs. Thank God, he is about played
■ out; as this session is the last he will get. He
(Smith) is a native of Pennsy mnia, aged 43 ;
physician by profession ; i3 married ; has
been in this Territory three years and on the
'coast fifteen. Smith's term expires 1865—
'Cummins' I860.
HON. JOSEPH MILLER,
'Of Boise county, is a little more liberal, but
•he could not bring himself up sufficiently to
'vote for the Funding bill for Boise county.
; He is devoting considerable labor on the Code,
'as - one of the Joiut Code Committee. His
'race* politically, is about run, and I don't
'think the Boise county people will regret it.
Hie is the leader of his side of the house in
all debates. Miller's term expires 1865.
HON. E. B. WATERBURY,
Of Fez Perce, is a whole-souled, good natured
individual—very tenacious about anything
that relates to the interests of his section of
the Territory. He is a native of Connecticut
—aged 39; auctioneer; unmarried; three
.wears in the Territory and same on the coast;
'Democrat, politically. Term expires 1865.
HON. S. S. KENN,
Is the oldest member in the Council—like Mr.
\Waterbury, is an easy, good natured soul ; is
considerable of a wit withal. He takes a
leading part in all the debates on big side of
the bouse, and is an able debater and ener
•getic Democrat, and a good legislator. He is
n native of Connecticut—aged 44 ; miner ; is
single ; been in the Territory two years and
.«»n the coast 14years; represents Idaho coun
ty—term expires 1866. \
110N. STANFORD CAPPS,
Is a young man, considerable of a rustler
very conservative, but, like all the other
members on this side of the Territory, is very
sensi ive/m regard to the interests of this
section. He is a native of Missouri, aged 39.
Is a miner by profession ; is unmarried ; has
been ia the Territory four years, and on the
-cca.st seventeen. His term expires iu 1865.
lie was electod on the Union ticket by Sho
shone county, that only polled 120 votes at
tue last election. Shoshone county, under
the present apportionment, with its 120 votes,
has one half the present representation in
the Council that Boise eounty has. On that
basis Boise-county would be entitled to sixty
Gouneilmen.
This completes the description of the
Council members. Nearly all of them hail
from the active pursuits of life, only four
professional ruen appealing in the list; and
'one of them, at least, a merely a pretender—
the aforesaid Ephraim.
The Legislature, as it now stands, is com
posed of twenty members on joint ballot,
eleven Democrats and nine Republicans. It
i 3 the first body of that political complexion,
1 believe, that has met in any State or Terri
•tory for some years."
WHAT HAS BKEN'ÇOS®
There was quite sharp fight iiV.the Council
op 'the Memorial to Congress to fbe
Territory, but it was finally defeated;— a ^ s0
<>u the Capital bill, in the same body, which
,p iB-ed. On the passage of this bill, all llj e
members lrom the northern portion of
Territory presented their protest, and it v* - * 3
spread upon the journals. 1 It wa3 afterward
presented in the House, arid bn motion of Mr.
Pierce, they were allowéd to spread it upon
the journal of that body. The Lewistonians
feel very blue over it generally, and would
favor Idaho City next year as against Boise
City. In fact thé entire delegation from this
side of the Territory, in both Houses, voted
for Mr. Pierce's proposition, as reported by
the Committee, to Jeave the question to a vote
of t^e people at the next general election ;
but* was defeated by a majority of one in
each House.
The only bill of importance yet passed by
bo'ihHouses, is the Specific Contract Law.,
the Capital bill, a Common School .L:sw, and
a bill for the Protection of Settlers cm the
Public Lands. The House has passed about
twenty-five House bills, and about ten Coun
cil bills ; and the Council about ten Council
bills, and two House bills. The GounciL
neglect everything emanating from the As
sembly, unless it is a pet measure-of some of
the members, or their friends, that they get
some member to introduce. 'Whether the
Governor signs the Specific Contract Act, or'
not, it can be passed over his veto by a two
thirds vote. I will send you a certified copy
as soon as it can be.obtaioed.
fA copy of the bill, as approved by the
Governor, appears dn another column.—-E d.]
A Looser 'On. *
The Presidents Message.
The annual message of the President was
delivered at the opening of »Congress on the
first Monday-of December. It is one of Mr.
Lincoln's own documente. 'Evidently he
employed no Seward to write tit for him:—
His papers are remarkable documents, and
years hence will be looked upon with won
dering awe, and many secret thanksgivings
by readers that they did not happen to livo
in an age so dark and barbarous..
A large portion.of the document .is devoted
to foreign relations. It is remarkable, how
ever, that little or nothing is said of any of
of the leading powers of Europe, but it
stead >we are supplied with-the minu test de
tails of our relations with -Liberia^»Costa
Rica, San Salvador, Egypt, Hayti, and many
other noted and influential- nations of the
same size. We are informed that the sym
pathisers of these powers,—and including
Hayti—are with the United States and '^con
stantly expressed." The African Republic,
Liberia, we are told "gives us a pleasing
view." The proposed overland telegraph
between America and Eufope, via Behring
Straits has been undertaken by some
Americans, and the idea of an oceanic tele
graph across the Atlantic is renewed. The
Brazilian difficulty is covered up by a few,
words .about " constant vigilence and just
spirit." '
The President thinks foreigners makegood
soldiers, and are very convenient to have
around when the New Englanders shirk. He
says : ' ,
I regard our emigrants as one of the prin
cipal replenishing streams whichjare appoint
ed by^ Providence to repair the ravages of in
ternal war and its wastes of national strength
and health. Aft that is necessary is to se
cure the flow of that stream in its present
fulness, and to that end the Government
must in every way, make It manifest that it
neither needs nor designs to impose involun
tary military service upon those who come
from other lands to cast their lots in our
country.
A brief statement of the finances is given
based upon the report of the Secretary of
the Treasury six monih3 ago. The public
debt he thinks very substantial "property."
He says :
Tbe public debt on the first day of July
last, as appears by the books of the treasury,
amount to $174,969,048*949. Probably
should the war continue for another year,
that amount may be increased by not far from
$500,000,000. Held «s it is for the most part
by our own people, it bas become a substan
tial branch 'of national though private pro
perty.
The philosophy of the foregoing is sumed
up iu one of those immortal maxims which
already rival Socrates and Ben Franklin :
"Men readily perceive that they cannot be
much oppressed by a debt which they owe
themselves."
The present number of army invalids now
on the pension list 22,767 ; 22,198 widows,
orphans and mothers have been placed ou
the army rolls. Four nundred and fifty
millions were paid during the year ending in
June, for pensions.
1 Of the. war, he congratulates the public
that the "armies have steadily advanced lib
erating (?) tbe States in the rear so th^ Ken
tucky, Missouri, and other States have pro
duced good crops."
lie rejoices that "important movements
have also occurred during the year to the
effect of moulding society for durability iu
the Union." What tbe agency for the mould
ing is, does not appear.
He recommends the general abolition of
slavery wherever it can be reached—and also
Increased taxation. lie says he finds relief
from his melancholy, in the fact, that a majori
ty of the men who entered the army are still
alive.
The election is declared an evidence of the
purpose of the people to maintain the Union,
and apparently forgetting that, the right of
the people to an election does cot come from
him, says thatjn "awarding the people a
fair opportunity" of showing their determin
ation" in has been of great value to the na
tional cause.
lie is of the opinion that "no attempt at
negotiation with the insurgent leader would
result in any good."
Speaking of the amnesty offered a year
ago to such os would accept it, he threatens :
"The dcor has, fora full year, been open
to ail suclri as were not in a condition to make
a free choice : that is, such as were in custody
or under constraint. It is still open to all,
but the time may comp, and will come, when
the public duty shall demand that it be clos
ed, and that in lieu, more vigorous measures
than heietoforeshall be adopted."
After declaring his deteiruination to en
force the emancipation proclamation, he
states the terms of peace in the following
closing words :
"In stating a single condition tif peace, I
mean simply to say that the warwill cease on
Hip pant of the government whenever it shall
have ceased on the part of those who began
it."
