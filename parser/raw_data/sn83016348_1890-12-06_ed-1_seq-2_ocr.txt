ELKTON. DECEMBER *l, 1890.
Senator Hearst, who owns one of
the richest gold mines in South
Dakota, worked in the Calitornia
mines forty years ago. The Sena
tor has just rounded out the age of
three score and ten.
The drop in prices of wheat, corn
and oats within ten days aften an
election in which the Democrats
scored a ‘‘big hit” is another sighiti
cant sign of the times. It is the
farmers who got this big hit.
Several Washington correspond
ents assert that Corporal Tanner has
received in fees Irom the Govern
ment as a pension attorney since he
was bounced from the Pension Of
fice $167,000. If the figures are even
doubled it was a profitable bounce
for the Corporal.
It seems clear that certain Demo
crats elected to the Kansas Legisla
ture intend to vote lor the return of
Senator Ingalls. Prominent Demo
crats from Kansas say that this is a
fact. A newspaper man who was in
Kansas during the late canvass and
election has just returned to Wash
ington. He says he knows ot four
Democratic members of the legisla
ture who openly avow their intention
to vote for Ingalls unless election of
a Democrat; that these men say they
dislike Ingalls as a politician, but
that he is a big man, a credit to the
state, and far preferable to any
Farmers’ Alliance man.
THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
President Harrison sent his annual
Message to Congress, on Monday
last. While it cannot be said that it
presents any new or original line of
thought that will command for it a
conspicuous place among state papers
it is nevertheless an excellent Mess
age, and shows that the administra
tion of the Government is in prud
ent and clean hands.
The President starts out with a
congratulation on the excellent work
which has been done by the adminis
tration in its general management,
a work which, as he says, has almost
wholly escaped unfavorable criticism
Every lair-minded citizen will agree
with him on this point.
After a brief summary of the opera
tions ol the Treasury Department
he declares that he has observed
with regret the recent depression
in the silver market, but he is not
prepared to venture any positive re
commendations on the future silver
policy ol the government. He thinks
that some months of further trial will
be necessary to realize the perman
ent effects ol the recent silver legis
lation, but he is gratified in knowing
hat the increased circulation, which
e operation of the law has brought
out, ‘‘has exerted and will con
ue to exert beneficial influence on
‘ness and general values.”
reviewing the operations of the
us departments, the President

deserves special attention, in

ports, the returns of savings banks,
trade balances, and the general pros
perity, and he submits figures relat
ing to our trade which prove that it
has had no injurious effects on busi
ness. but rather that the volume of
business, has increased. As for the
recent disturbances in the money
market, he shows that their oritjjn
in London was not connected with
similar causes here; that the. effect
is only a temporary one, and that it
will not withstand ‘‘the strong, safe
and wholesome influences which are
operating to give the people profita
ble returns in all branches of legiti
mate trade and industry.” Ihe
President also dwells with some
satisfaction, if not Exultation, on the
foreign outcry against the Tariff act
as a justification of its wisdom for us.
He then enters into a dissertation on
the benefits of taking advantage im
mediately of the reciprocity clauses
the McKinly law, by which he may,
in return for the free admission of
tea,coffee,sugar and hides, “open for
eign markets especially for our farm
products." This part of the message
follows evidently the suggestions of
the Secretary of State on this favo
rite object of his policy and will be
received with general favor
STUBBORN FACTS FOR FARMERS.
Without a Protective Tariff Indian Wheat Wil
Soon Usurp Our Market.
Editor Country Gentleman: In an ad
dress before the New Jersey Board of
Agriculture, and published in Sixteenth
Annual Report, J. D. Taylor made some
interesting statements in figures, show
ing the difference between a comparative
ly new nation and one which has gradu
ally become “the creditor aatiou of the
world.” Alter stating some facts re
lative to prices aud markets in this
country many years or half a century or
more ago, aud which statements old men
will now corroborate, he remarked in
substance that, when a boy, hundreds
and thousands of barrels of apples lay
rotting in orchards for want of a market;
a cow was bought for only seven or eight
dollars, aud men worked for thirty cents
a day; butter wasQeven or eight cents a
pound, and eggs four cents a dozen. He
had himself worked for a quarter of a
dollar a day, and had had to take an
order for it, for there was no money.
The women dressed in suubonnets and
calico dresses, and all worked from five
o’clock in the morning until seven or
eight at night.
Matters changed. In 1554, the farmers
bought almost more than they sold, and
gold and silver were shipped across the
sea, and at the end of the year we had
sixty million dollars less. We took out
of the mountains of California $809,000,-
000 of gold, but when the war opened in
1861 there was not 75,millious of it in the
United States; more Jtfaan 500 millions
had gone to pay the balance of trade.
Now, business men (not politicians) say
that England has always the balance
against her. This is true. Tne reports
show that for forty or fifty years the bal
ance of trade has been against England,
and that it has not broken England up,
and that therefoaa the balance of trade
against us will not break the United Sta
tes. This seems like a strong argument,
almost unahswerable.
But the cases are very unlike. That
which wjl) break the United States will
uot break England. This is the reason
we cannot cope with England in this
direction. When England loses $250,
000,000 every year because she buys mot*
mexchandise than she sells, she can stand
it, we cannot. It is because “England is
the creditor nation of the world." She
owns our state bonds, and our county
bonds, our railroad bonds, our school
bonds —millions’ worth. She owns the
bonds of Germany aud France, and Rus
sia aud Turkey and Spain—she is the
creditor nation, and if the balance of
trade is three hundred millions against
her, what steed she care, for she has six
hundred million dollars coming in the
shape of interest on her moneys each
year on the money she has loaned
throughout the world? England was
wise enough to become the creditor na
tion of the world, and accumulate this
great wealth, before she passed the first
free-trade measure. She gathered her
riches through protective laws, and then
she began to cope with other countries.
A few years ago, they grew almost no
wheat in India, but they now have 27
million acres under cultivation, aud last
year they produced 259 million bushels
of wheat—almost as much as the whole
produced in the entire United Slates.
Aud now England is building railroads
leading from India to London, so far as
they can go. Fourteen thousand miles
of railroad are building, to be paid for
by the British government, to enable the
people of England to produce their wheat
cheaper; and in India, where labor is only
seven or eight cents a day, aud where
people live on rice and millet, two hun
dred million people will xaise all the
wheat the world will want to consume.
If they increase as they have done, in a
few years they can laud wheat at thirty
five cents on the American shore. How
can we then get a dollar a bushel for our
wheat? Old Farmer.
“I use Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral freely in

Tlio Petersburg (Va.) Index-Appeal
makes this frauk and unblushing ac
knowledgment of the deception practised
upon the country by its parly in order to
mislead and influence the voteis in the
recent elections. Hear it :
The congressional campaign of IS9O
has been fought and won by the Demo
cratic party, and the country rejoices
over the result. lu that campaign, as in
every political campaign, many tilings
were said and done in partisan interests
that could hardly be justified by any
standard of morals short of the old
maxim that everything is fair in war ai d
politics. The exigency, however, for this
questionable method ot warfare is new
past, and it is high time to give a quietus
to the campaign lie, of wiiioh such effec
tive use has already been made, that all
the necessaries of iifo have been inoieif.
ed by the new tariff bill. No paper can
longer justify itself, oven on the ground
of partisan service, for giving circulation
to this falsehood, and the papers that
continue to publish such indefensible
statements simply make themselves allies
of speculators and extortionists and are
enemies of the great consuming mass of
the people.
This paper uot only admits the lie, but
declares that it and other Democratic
journals made themselves “allies of
speculators aud extortionist, and enemies
of the great consuming mass ot the
people,” in order to elect a Democratic
Congress.
