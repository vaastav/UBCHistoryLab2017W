ROBBERY.
BAY .CITY'S DRY SUNDAY

office in Olivet between 2 and 3 o'clock
Sunday morning and sheriffs, depu
ties, other officers and citizens are
scouring Eaton and Calhoun counties
In search of the trio. The attempt re

ernment cash. The burglars first In
vaded the blacksmith shop of Guy

which they pried open the back door.

and the explosion, which blew off the
heavy door, was heard In nearly every
part of the village. The Inner door
was broken and part of it was wedged
in against the sfrong box so that the

league starting an active campaign
against the liquor traffic for the first
time in local history. The saloonmen
have- done business nights, Sundays and
holidays without Interference for so
many years that some of them, at
least, think that It has become a vest
ed right with them. Being forced to
close they are now talking of com
pelling everyone else to observe the
Sunday law. This town thus becomes
tho center of attack on saloons In this
section of the state. The anti-?aloon-Ists
will first try to get Bay City in
line and then will advance on the
traffic in the surrounding country,
working to the north, whieji like this,
has for manv years been free and
easy in regard to grog.

VIRGINIA MINE
fl DEATH TRAP
GREATEST CALAMITY IN THE
HISTORY OF AMERICAN
MINING.
OVER FIVE HUNDRED DIE
There Are All and More Than the
Usual Attendant Horrors to Appal
the Rescuers, and Onlookers.
The explosion in the Fairmont Coal
Co.'s mines, Nos. 6 and 8, at Monon
gah, W. Va., which dazed the people,
caused the greatest disaster and loss
of life In the history of American min
ing. The streets of Fairmont and
Monongah were crowded Saturday
night and thousands lined the hills
in the vicinity of the wrecked works.
At 9 p. m. only 29 bodies had been re
covered, but scores were In sight. The
deadly black-damp became more pro
nounced as the further recesses of the
mines were approached. It was a phys
ical impossibility to To faster than
the air, which traveled slowly on ac
count of the men having to brattice
many old entries as they worked for
ward. ,
It was stated by General Manager
Ieo T. Malone, of the mine, that 478
actual miners were checked off as en
terlng the mines Friday morning. Thi?
number, it was further stated, did
not- include fully 100 trappers, mule
drivers, pumpers and boys who are
not under the check system. Should
these figures be correct, the death list
will be over 530 persons. The condi
tion of the bodies thus far recovered is
horrible. Many are dismembered;
some are fearfully crushed and the
rest are blackened and burned beyond
recognition. The body of J. M. Mc
Graw, pit boss, and one of the best
known mining men In West Virginia,
was recovered in mine No. 8. It was
headless and otherwise disfigured,
Identification having been made by the
clothing and shoes he wore.
Chicago Won Out.
In Chicago on June 16, 190S, the
convention that will name the next
standard bearer of the Republican
party will be called to order. The city
and date were decided upon Saturday
by the Republican national committee
in an exciting session and the final
decision was unanimous.
The convention will be held in the
Coliseum, which seats 14,000 people.
Chicasoans say the next convention
will be the first real one since l&SS;
that, is the first in which the result
will not be known in advance, and In
view of the tremendous Interest that
will be displayed Chicago alone can
handle the visitors properly aud take
care of the newspapers.
Kansas City made a splendid fight
to land the gathering, and its showing
in the vote was a strong one. Denver
also bid, offering $100,000 in cash,
but the superior attractions of the
Windy City and the facilities there for
the handling of the news of the con
vention decided the matter. The orig
inal vote stood: Chicago, 32; Kansas
City, 17; Denver, 4.
Troops in Goldfleld.
The trouble with miners in Gold
field, Nev., is probably over now that
the soldiers have arrived. The town
breathed a sigh of relief Saturday
morning when the dav broke without
any act of violence having been com
mitted during the night. It was feared
on all hands that In anticipation of the
coming of the troops the night would
be taken advantage of by the lawless
to make a demonstration.
The worst fear was from fire. The
wind blew a gale all night, and the
air was full of the first -snow of win
ter. A citizens' guard had been posted
throughout the 'town and along the
water and light lines for several miles
beyond the town limits. The ktraiw
was tense and few slept.
The Chinks Are Deluded.
There Is an important feature of the
Japanese side of the question which
has not been mentioned publicly. It
is the effect in China of the agitation
of the past few months.
The Japanese government views
with mixed feelings the coming Amer
ican naval demonstration in the Pa
cific, not because it Is doubtful of the
intentions of the American govern
ment, but because It fears the effect
on the Chinese minds.
Tho Chinese are being imbued with
the idea that America is moving in
their behalf against Japan. News from
China during the past few months has
faintly described the anti-Japanese
movement which Is gathering head
way In that country. The conviction is
growing among all classes that Rus
sia's successful opponent has schemes
of aggrandizement at the expense of
the flowery kingdom and the feeling
has already reached dangerous propor
tions. Ten Per Cent Stabbed.
The Italian government is maklnsr
a half-hearted attempt to diminish
cases of murder and injury by stab
bing. It has been estimated that the
total number killed and injured by
knife stabs in a year has been almost
10 per cent of the entire population,
and It is therefore proposed to enact
a special law, putting common knives,
razors and such articles, which are
usually carried in the pocket. In the
same category with daggers and fire
arms.
Anyone found to possess such weap
ons is liable to four months' imprison
ment for the first offense, and longer
sentences for subsequent offences.
A Brand New Heiress.
A girl baby was born Saturday to
Mr. and Mrs. K. Parmelee Trent Ice, of
New York, their second daughter. Mrs.
Prentice is a daughter of John D.
Rockefeller, and the baby will be,
therefore, one of the richest heiresses
In the world. Mr. Rockefeller has the
utmost confidence In Mr. Prentice,
who is a lawyer, partly for tho reason
that his son In-law shuns publicity
even more than the oil Mn? himself.
The Prentices, it is believed, will In
herit a large part of the Rockefeller
millions.
