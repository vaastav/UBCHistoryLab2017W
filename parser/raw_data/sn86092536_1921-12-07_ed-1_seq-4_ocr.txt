THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Of many excellent recommendations made by President Harding in his
(message to congress yesterday, those relating to the assistance of America In
world restoration and the enactment of a flexible tariff measure are outstanding.
First place In his address was given by the president to world restoration,
Indicating his deep personal convictions upon this subject. Declaring that the
nations most directly concerned must apply heroic remedies to the conditions
with which they are faced, lie says, "Then we can help, and we mean to hplp."
He points out that we have both unselfish and seltlsh reasons for such assistance,
the latter betng that the conditions which mark our own "high tide of fortunate
?advancement are possible only when the nations of all continents are restored
> .
to stable order and normal relationship."
In thus directing attention so Impressively to what Is self-evident, the presi
dent has performed a world service. This is one of the great policies which
America must keep constantly before her until world economic health la re
stored. 1'art of our service will be purely humanitarian, but the major part will
redound to our own benefit. There is much in the way of restored prosperity
that we cannot possibly obtain without giving the full measure of assistance to
? J
Europe which Mr. Harding recommends.
Referring to the permanent tariff law which he recohimends to replace the
? emergency act of the extra session, the president strongly advocates flexibility
, of rates to take care of the rapidly changing conditions, particularly the vary
ing rates of foreign exchange. In this connection he says In part:
"I know of no tr.anmr in which to effect this flexibility other than the ex
tension of th? towers of the tariff commission, so it can adapt itself to a
. scientific and wholly just administration of the law. 1 am not unmindful of the
.constitutional difficulties. These can be met by giving authority to the chief
.executive, who cotsid proclaim additional duties to meet conditions which the
, congress may designate. The grant of authority to proclaim would necessarily
( bring the tariff commission into new and enlarged activities, because no execu
( tlve cou'.d discharge a duty except upon Information acquired and recommenda
tions made by this commission. But the plan is feasible, and tiie proper func
' tioning of the board would ruo us a better administration of u defined policy
4 than ever can be made pi sslb'e by tariff duties prescribed without flexibility.
"There is a manifest difference of opinion about the Amertcun valuation.
' 4 Many nations have'adopted delivery valuation as their basis for collecting duties:
4 that Is. the> take the cost of the imports delivered at the port of entry as ths
'basis for levying duty, it is no radical departure, in view of the varying condi
tions and the disordered state of money values, to provide for American' valua
tion. but there cannot be ignored the danger of such a valuation brought to the
4 level of our "vvn production costs, making our tarlif prohibitive, it might do so
4 til many instances where imports ought to be encouraged. I believe congress
'ought well to consider the desirability of the only promising alternative, namely,
?a provision authorizing proclaimed American valuation, under prescribed eondl
' lions, on any given list of articles imported.
"In th.s proposed flexibility authorizing increases to meet conditions so
' likely to change, there should also be provision for decreases A rate may be
' just today and entirely out of proportion six months from today. If our tariffs
'are to be made equitable and not necessarily burden our Imports and hinder our
? trade abroad, frequent adjustment will be necessary for years to come. Knowing
? the Impossibility of modification by act of congress for any one or .a score of
? linea without involving a long array of schedules, I think we shall go a long way
toward stabilization if there is recognition of the tariff commission's fitness to
< recommend urgent changes by proclamation."
t This Is one of the best discussions of the present tariff problem that it has
been The Intelligencer's pleasure to see. Very little indeed can be added to
? tho president's masterly exposition. Equitable tariff rates cannot be established
4 by congress under present conditions even for the length of time it would take
? a tariff measure to pass both houses. Flexibility Is essential to any successful
' tariff law at the present time. The method proposed by Mr. Harding Is the
practical and obvious one.
' THE FARMER AND MR. j
; GOMPERS
< In today's Intelligencer Is reproduced
an open letter from a farmer of Orange
county. California, to President Samuel
, Gomjiers of the American Federation of
? Labor. This letter Is not only Interest
' ing, but very much to the point. The
, farmer. Mr. C. K. I tt, sa; a to Uompers. .
. In part:
' "A! though the farmer constitutes
'nearly half the nation and performs
' ? more than haf the labor of the country.
? you do not seem to know that lie exists.
1 "The farmer Is earning for his labor
' Income very much less than In 1011. bo
cause his other costs are double those'
( of 1914. due principally to the refusal of
union labor to share in the deflation.
? "You ignore the farmer as an eco
nomic and integral factor in the situa
? Tlon.
"I'nton labor constitutes only about!
' one-tlfth of the labor and people of
' these I'ruted States, and their attempt
to hold the 'advantages' gained by theni
, during the recent general insanity can
have no other result t"h;?n unemploy-'
, ment.
. "The result of this lamentable out
? rage Is that after he has spent all his
income he is only able to get half the.
' things he wants or could buy If wiges:
were deflated in proportion as his total
Income has been.
, "Let the cost of building return like
, the farmer's products to around the
. 1914 level, and this country will experi
ence the greatest building boom in his
? tory, with a consequent reduction of
rents and unemployment.
' "You only represent a small segment'
of American labor. The farmer and his
' assistants perform much m^re labor
man trie .-v. c. o. iiK-ui Jou, ?.?
. Ins of that performed by uuurganlied
? i labor."
Mr. Vtt strikes bard and straight
, from the shoulder. In his estimate of
4 ? the relative importance of the farmer.
V he Is absolutely Torre-.?. Thero can he
Bno real or permanent i rospenty in this
^Bpation un'ess the t'armer be prosperous,
does not take a tnathemati-ian to flg
^?re out that the farmer, with 1)3 cent
^neat. 38 cent corn Mid eight cent cot
cannot buy the pr -ducts of men
?Pno are still receiving war prices. The
^Bfarmer must get a fa.r price in propor
tion to all other prices. I'ntll he does,
> our economic situation will remain In
? a state of chao*.
' One of the greatest problems we are
, facing today s to put the farmer back
? on his feet, either by lowering other ?
? prices or by increasing the prices he
| receives. Conditions in cities and towns
. must bear a relationship to conditions ;
1 on the farm.
The farmer d-.eg not ask short hours
or easy conditions of labor. Instead of
44 or 48 hours a week, he works ?>". 7)
or SO hours and does not consider It as
' an unbearable hardship. Instead of. a ;
comfortable workshlp. well ventilated
In summer and heated in winter, he !s
' exposed to the blazing sun and the i
, wintry blasts. But It is not of these

Bl must share alike in the great j
privileges established by our immortal
constitution. No one group can be per
mitted to receive a share of the total
national income which makes It impos
sible for another group to receive a fair
share. That Is the condition we have
today as between union labor and the
farmer. Obviously, it must be corrected.
MR. DARST AND THE CAPI
TOL SITE
The Intelig.-nevr prints today a state
ment on the location of the new slate
capltol by Hon. John S. Darst. taken
from the Charleston Daily Mall. Mr.
Durst bus been one of the strongest ad
vocates of keeping the capltol inside
the corporate limits of Charleston He
states, what Is undoubtedly a fact, that
the great majority Vof the people arc for
the old location. Mr. Darst also takes
a strong position on the legal status of
the proposition t?? locate the new build
ing outside the corporate limits of the
capital city. To do so, he points out.
would be to change the eeat of govern
ment without legislative sanction, and
the courts would undoubtedly act to
pres ent such Illegal procedure. Kvery
man end woman In West Virginia Is
interested in the location of the new
capitol building, and The Intelligencer
trusts that Mr. Darst's article will bo
carefully read.
GLAD TIDINGS
Coining unexpectedly out of tin* gloom
is the joyful news of a settlement of
the Irish question. It Is a little hard
to realize that this is the settlement of
the centuries-old controversy between
England and Ireland, hut. from the dis
patches, such seems to be the fact
The terms, In brief, are that Ireland
Is to be a free state, similar to Canada
or Australia, having the same connec
tion with the British empire, and that
the consent of Ulster Is not css.-ntlal to
the agreement. Ulster, it is stated, may
either enter the new arrangement or re
tain her present status.
That England nnd the Sinn IVin rep
resentatives have concluded such am
agreement Is remarkable. It is the sim
plest and sanest solution possible, but
there -was no Indication, up until the
last minute, that it would ever be
reached. I.et us trust that later din
patrhea will confirm all of the roseate
reports and that the great problem of
Ireland Is Indeed settled.

Shows Oomp?j?UT? Importance of
I Onranlind Xnibor and the
r?m?ra of the Nation.
The following: open letter is addressed
j to President Samuel Qompera of the (
'American Federation of Labor by C. E.
Utt, a California farmer.
Tuatln, < "al.. Sept. 22, 1931.
MR. SAMUEL UOMFttlRS.
j Prea.. A. F. L? New York.
! DEAR SIR:
Tou are quoted us saying that "The
: present unemployment situntlon is an
I economic crime." Quite right, but who j
' are the criminals?
The farmer lias been thoroughly de- 1
i flatod. His gross income has been >
practically cut in half, and his labor
Income almost annihilated. Although
the farmer constitutes nearly half the
nation and perforins more than half the |
labor of the country you do not seem
to know that he exists, or knowing
that, you consider that he was created (
i to be exploited by the labor unions, rall
j road brotherhoods and the middlemen, j
The farmer Is earning for his labor in- |
como very ftiueii less than In 1914 be
cause his other costs are doublo that i
of 1914. due principally to the refusal of j
union labor to share In tha deflation.
You also say that "wage reductions
will not relievo the situation." In this j
you are, in my opinion, entirely mis
taken. You like moat city men, Ignore
j the farmer as an economic and integral
factor In tho situation. If, as you seem
(quite naturally. I presume) to think,
tho five million labor union members '
1 constituted "Labor" or even were a
i ma)or(ty of labor, or of the people of
! this country, you would be correct In
I that case what the carpenter anil the
j plasterer extorted from the locomotive
engineer In high priced houses and i
rents the Railway Urotherhoods would
j In turn extort from the plasterer and
(carpenter It* high priced freight and
! passenger rates, and bo on through all <
j the union tradce. However, union
labor constitutes only about ono-flfth
; of the labor and people of these United
I States and their attempt to hold the
"ADVANTAOBS" gained by them
' during the recent general InHunlty ran
have no other reeult than unemploy
ment.
1 wish to eall your attention to a few J
facts.
i The farmer not only performs more
than half the labor of the country, but
1 he Is ulmoat half the people
Income and Outgo.
' ? i ? ??>"? In half while
MIS groan invviuv
almost everything, he buys is priced to,
I him. at double price, due to double
wages for union labor. It does not
matter which way he turns, he Amis ?
carpenters, plasterers, palntcm, railroad
I operators and all union labor extorting
'double wages from him. The result of
this lamentable outrage Is that after he
i lias spent all his Income he Is only
able to get half the things he wants or
could buy If wages were deflated In pro
portion as his total Income has been
(As I have explained before, his labor
Income has almost disappeared.)
It follows, therefore, that so far as
the farmer is concerned he can only
Veep half as many men busy at JS per
'day as he could at $< per day.
j You complain of high priced rents.
If building costs Increase 300 per cent
I as they did by 1920, can you expect
rents to stay down? Now building costs
have decreased, due to greater efficiency
of labor and lower material prices, to
100 per con' of normal, that Is to say
a J100O cottage for a por man may now
.be built for |?00a. This Is,due to the
high pr'ce of labor.
Now does this rob Henry Ford or
iJohn Rockefeller, or the poor wan?
, And Is either Mr. Ford or Mr Rocke
feller to blarp" that the carpenter and
i and wherefores of the rejection of the j
; recall petitions, at least.
I.lojd George may'not come to Wash
ington. Too tame, perhaps, after being
i in the Irish negotiations. i
1.umber rates from the Pacific arc to |
be lower. All aboard!

You also Inquire for the capitalist
who "has suggested a reduction In the
rate of Interest." In 1914 the banks In .
this part of California charged "s
farmers 7 per cent. I'urine tbe war
they raised the rate to s per cent and
have now reduced that rate to 7 per
cent or the pre-war rate of discount.
Contrast with this the 200 per cent in
crease which union labor Is extorting;
from us and you will understand why
at last the farmer Is beginning to awake
to who his enemies are. A. farmer who
has had his fruit and vegetables rot In
the tie*Id because those who haul his ;
stuff to market enforce double pay la
doing some thinking and "Union Labor" i
Is going to hear the results of his con
clusions.
Now, Mr. Gompers, because you are
the very able and honored president of
the American Federation of Labor you
have easily, been duped into thinking
you are tbe voice of labor and also you
hnve been able, through united slTort,
to make most of the country belloxo It.
Stupendous error.
As TTtb goes It.
You only represent a small segment
of American labor. The farmer und his
assistants perform much mora labor
than the A. F. L. members, to say noth
ing of labor performed by unorganized
labor. Tbe A. F. L, is banded together
to promote Its own Interest by exploit
ing ths other members of society,
chiefly the farmer X have beard many
rhapsodies about tbe "sacred rights of
labor." 1 should like to ask you which
Is worn sacred, the (toiler In my pocket
which I earned yesterday or my today's
labor by which I hope to earn another
dollar?
I should like also to ask why the
farmer ts expected to work for twenty
flve cents per hour land this Is much
more than his labor Income for 1920
1921 >. to produce food for nil, and then
when he ts met at ths railway by the
brotherhood who operate the trains
they should be permitted to extort from
him the $1 to *2 per hour for hauling
this some food to market? Yes, "labor
in e tic red," at least that of some few
people.

them together to relieve the unemploy
ment situation. This ear. ho done only
In onu of two ?uys. Either double the
price of farm products or halve the
pcloe of tho things the farmer has to
buy. Including; labor In the form of
manufactures, buildings, machinery and
transportation. etc. Any one v :iO ran
perform either of these miracles will
he able to put several million of the
unemployed to work.
In conclusion, Mr. Gompers. the
farmer from very necessity Is being
forced to think ami organize. And 1
hope lie will not be misled by demago
gues to ask for especial privileges and
monopolies, as has union labor, but will
content himself with Improving his
product and giving his customers a
better service through so-operative
effort. And that be will se to It that
the special privileges now granted to
union labor are swept away so that nil
industry may be on the same competi
tive basis as bis own. Invisible govern
ment. whether of capital or labor or
church or secret society. Is Intolerable

says Secretary mil, "and after a period
of unlimited expenditure In war mea

found necessary to curtail such expend!- |

Kecretary FVil devotes a considerable j
1 part of his retort to reclamation pro
jects and In this connection he urges 1
that "an affirmative strong policy be 1
announced by the executive."
"The necessary ndvances can be made |
I from year to ytar without becoming nn i

I the s*'rotary .says, "and as has already |

legislation, of course the cost of such |
project wlll.be repaid and meanwhile'
the added wealth yielded will lighten |
the tax burdens upon all the taxpayers I
of the country."
Opportunity for Labor
Referring to pending hills providing J
for further reclamation activities. Mr. j'
Kail says that If they are enacted nddl- j
tlonal opportunity for labor will be j
offered the unemployed and at the same |
time homes made for those who desire
them.
"This department." he adds. "Is thor- !
I ninthly cruanb.ed with sufficient force!
and Is ready to carry on any w<>rk which |
nueh an enlightened policy as suggested |
might he assigned to It in reclamation
or other development of our national
resources."
I Discussing the situation In Alaska,
the Interior secretary declares the re
sourced of that territory and "the
! Wealth to he drawn therefrom In the
! future are almost Incalculable."
I "There are 21.000,000 ncres of lands
!n forests in that territory." he ?ay*
and many millions of a<"res upon the
public domain upon which settlers inay
depend for mining timbers, lumber for
bourses, etc. There are millions of
acres of land fitted for agricultural and
the agricultural resources are such that
a large population can be supported la
Alaska without the Importation of food
stuffs front the United States or other
countries.
Alaska's Resource#
"Alaska's resources have not been
developed f>>r various reasons, among1
others the lack of transportation end
largely because of the fact that these
resources are administered through
some thirty-eight bureaus and various
departments of this government. In
my ojdnlon authority to udjninister the
laws relative to Alaska's .natural re
sources must be vested in some one
department of this government that the
activities charged with the administra
tion of such laws may be properly c??
oftlinated.
"Transportation is necessary of course
nnd the government has assisted Insofar
as tho construction of a railroad from
Seward to Fairbanks Is concerned, which
road will he ready for operation within
a few months. Vast deposits of valua
ble metalliferous minerals and great
coal mines are known to exist and mu^t
bo made accessible to tho railroad and
to coast transportation.
"\Vhilo no extensive oil development
has nVj yet been made. It is well known
to this department that indications of
valuable oil deposits exist from Point
Harrow to tho Seward peninsula."
A lot of men go strutting around the
earth as If they owned it who are really
so insignificant they've never been soli
cited to sign a patent medicine testi
monial.
