Iiknself a reputation as a just and im

the Judge's charges, is the employment
of humorous illustrations that forcibly
represent the different phases of the

as defendants also claim the broad strines
on the piano box. The plaintiff says
that he is not only entitled to recover in
this actiou, the value of the new bubs,
shafts, spokes, and felloes, together with
the stripes on the piano box, and the
added value of the workman's labor be
stowed npon them, because, say his coun
sel, it was '.he duty of the coachmaker to
complete his undertaking to build this
buggy ; and if he did not, nor the de
fendants for him, then the plaintiff has a
right to get back this material at just
what they were worth, including the la
bor, at the time of the Sheriff's sale ;
and, gentlemen, we so think, and so say
for to hold anything else, would be to
offer a premium for faithlessness in the
performance of solemn engagements, and
unless such were the law, it would lead
to inextricable confusion, vexation and
wrong.
Let us run defendants' logic to its le
gitimate consequences. Let me illustrate.
Suppose Mr. Doty took his boots to a
Knight of St. Crispin to be half-soled,
and after the shoemaker has got one boot
half soled, an execution creditor comes
aloug, levies on the labor of the shoe
maker bestowed on the half-soled boot,
and buys it at the Sheriff's sale must
the learned counsel lose his boots, which
were only half half-soled t and if the
purchaser of the half-soled boot took
possession of it, then either the counsel
must buy out the Sheriff's vendee, or get
one new boot to match tbe one he still
owns, or else the Sheriff's vendee must
buy Mr. Doty's other boot, and in tbe
event of their disagreeing on the terms,
neither could derive any use for his sin-
gle boot. Tl.is, gentlemen, would ue
quite aunoying.
Or, again, suppose a young lady, in all
the glorious pride of womanly beauty.

And
we may well imagine and it is within
the range of reasonable probability, and
within the scope of human events that
this joyous girl, warming into womanly
beauty, exciting glowing and intoxicating
reminiscences, even in the fancy of the
Court and doubtless the jury, for wc are
not superior to this weakuess, may her
self lose forever the undying love and
admiration of her beau, for want of a
bonnet, with the consequences of which
calamity so fearfully alarming that the
Court and doubtless the jury also can
not fail to be most profoundly impressed,
and cannot decline to declare that a prin
ciple followed by such damaging results,
never can be the law.

A Jljslerj.
A fuw days ago Ellen Brannon ap
peared before Mayor Fox and made affi
davit that aboat two years ago she was a
witness of a fearful murder committed in
a house on Front street, near Pine. The
circumstances, as related, are briefly as
follows : A countryman, with a well
filled pocketbook, containing probably
from five hundred to a thousand dollars,
was decoyed into the house mentioned by
a disreputable woman. Inside be in
dulged in wines, and while under the in
fluence of the intoxicating beverage was
seized by four men, inmate of the house,
who garrotted the uufortuuatc man, cut
his throat from ear to ear, and afterwards
robbed him. The informant also alleged
that the body was cut iu two, and bur
ied in the cellar of the houc. Detec
tives Miller and Cobb were detailed to
investigate the case. The cellar was ex
cavatcd, but no remains were found. It
is believed that the body was exhumed
shortly after the murder and conveyed
to a safe repository. Taken altogether
the case is one of peculiar mystery.

A Press correspondent writes of the
desecration of the Sabbaih iu New Or

A stranger visiting this city for the
first time is more or less shocked that is
according to his early traiuing at the
desecration of the Sabbath in this region.
As soon as the street lamps are lighted on
Sunday evening bands of musis take po

places of amusement, and for an hour or
so discourse their best music to the edifi

MEMORY.
Memory is the store bouse of the
mind, where is placed tbe pleasing fan
cies, sorrows, and troubles, that cross
tbe paths of mankind. No one can in
terfere with the relics she has collected
there ; ever sbine as bright jewels in a
golden casket
Aristotle makes experience the mother
of art, memory the mother of experience.
We know 'tis the past that improves
the present and colors the future. She

twilight of life, when mind and body are

flowers."
Some minds penetrate on the instant
others by continued application the
latter generally are the most retentive,
although there are wonderful exceptional
instances on record. Seneca could re
peat two thousand words heard but once.
Mozart the great musician could take a
copy of a piece of music after hearing it
once. At fourteen years of age his
presence was requested by Pope Clement,
the XVIII for remembering and noting
correctly afterwards, a far-famed piece of
which it was forbidden to give a copy.
It is related of Temistocles that he could
call by name every citizens of Athens

Cyrus kuew the names of every soldier

faculties centered in the memory of sweet
sounds otherwise he is a blind imbecil.
Like Mozart be can remember music

W hitticr, the poetical idol of our land,
composed his most popular works from
recollections of his early youth. We,
too, from his magic description, can see
the old homo circle, the bright wooj
fire, and almost shudder at the north
wind's roaring. Some of the forms on
which the fire light danced have gone to
their long homes yet the poet says each
in their respective sphere to fill up the
tale of other years and those who re
main on earth will
Sit with him by the oil homestead hearth
And stretch tbe hands of memory forth
To warm them at the wood fires' blaxe."
EUREKA.
Woman's Bights.
TLe progress of the woman's rights
agitation was illustrated afresh and posi
tively before Judge Sharswood, at Nisi
Prius, yesterday, where there was the
novel spectale of a woman, in her legal
capacity, arguing in a demurrer in a ease
against sundry election officers who re
fused to recognize her in her capacity as
a voter. Such actions as these bring
the whole circle of woman's rights into
prominence, and the eloquence of counsel
may stir a judicial pang that the law has
not recognized a function so irresistibly
approved. But in Montana, where wo
man suffrage was briefly tried, it has
been denied North Am'.rican of last
week.
Efidemio disease is not at present con,
