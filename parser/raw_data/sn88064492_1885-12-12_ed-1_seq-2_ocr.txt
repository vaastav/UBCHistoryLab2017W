purpose of dissuading him from at

Their argument was that the pnb

that the pre^s is commenting upon
the fact that the death ot President
Cleveland would restore the Repub

feared might tempt another Gai

Mr. Cleveland's visitors said they
did not like to disease the question
of his death, bat they thongbt it
their duty to advise him to guard
his life carefully, us it was now of !
more importance than ever. I

I was unfit for any maim

try it. /vhout four years ago I
commenced to take S. S. S. accor

about fifty bottles. The results are
most remarkable. My eough has
left me, my strength has returned,
