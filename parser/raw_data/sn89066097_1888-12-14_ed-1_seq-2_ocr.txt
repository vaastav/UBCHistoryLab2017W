KIRKSVILLE . - MISSOURI
FRIDAY DEC. 14, 1SSS.
The number of votes cast
in the United States nt the recent
election is about 12,000,000.
The tendency of prices is
upward since the election of Har
rison admission to Normal en
tertainments have incrensed S3 1-3
per cent.
Potatoes are retailing in
western Kansas at 81.00 a bushel;
apples, $1.50; Hour, So.25 per 100
lbs; coal, $0.00 per ton, and every
thing else proportionately high.
Tho United States Fish
eries Association have adopted
resolutions asking Congress for
such legislation as shall make our
navy respectablo in sizo and
quality.
It is stated on good authority
that the president-elect is a rela
tive of Jefferson Davis. However
the relationship will be no induce
ment to offer Jefferson i cabinet
position.
The Si-nate has begun the
consideration of the tariff bill, and
President Cleveland may have ul
opportunity during the life of the
Fiftieth congress to write another
blundering veto.
mi - tt i i ,
j.ne xif"t ims taicen up
the direct lax ic funding bill. The
time for voting on this bill was
fixed at 4 o'clock, Wednesday
afternoon, when, it was thought

the bill would puss.
"West Tlrg.iiia has proba-
blj' elected c ' omocratie govern
or and Democratic electors, but
the plurality is so small that West
Virginia may hereafter be count
ed cs a Republican state.
m
The Florida orange crop is
estimated at 3,000,000 boxes, which
is more than double the product of
any previous year. ButtheFlordia
crop will not be one-half the
oranges sold in our markets.
Missouri's leeislature-oleet
is made up of 21 democrats, 9 re
publicans and 1 labor union re
publican in the senate; tho house
contains 7S democrats, 51 republi
cans, 11 union-labor. On ioint
ballot the republicans have gained,
largely due to the city of St.
Louis.
While prices for farm pro
ducts and stock of nearly all
kinds have been unsatisfactory for
three or four years, tho draft
horse has brought uniformly good
prices. The owner of a good
draft-hoico never has to search
for a market; tho market always
comes to him and the prices ob
tained arc invariably renumera-
tivt.
Leading Democratic joirrnals
and poliiticiaus now concede that
a solid south is no longer tenable.
Tho naked truth is that tho South
will not remain solid and no effort
of her politicians can keep her in
that condition.
Virginia, West Virginia, Ala
bama, Georgia, Xorrh Carolina
and Tcnuesseo can be depended
upon to ultimately become repub
lican states. The politicians view
the ominous signs of tho times
and are already casting nbout for
methods of vigorous propagation
of Democratic priciples in the agri
cultural states of the west, thinking
that a power can be placed in tho
hands of these states that will
s weep away and entirley c'lestroy
tho protective policy of the conn-
try.
Tho Democratic party cr m make
no greater mistake, than to attompt
to regain its power by tiro aid bf
western farmers. ThiB is the con
clusion to which an educational
campaign has brought uv j majori
ty of the people.
It is notable that the appeals to
the farming class to voto for Free
Trade were entirely ignored, and
that tho great agricultural states
voted for Harrison in a body, Min
nesota, the hope of the Free Trad
ers, giving him tho largest vote
she has ever given to any candi
date for tho Presidency.
The farmer has to earn what he
WASHINGTON LETTER.
Senator Allison has proven
himself n truo prophet in ralalion
to tho republican substitute for
the Mills tariff bill, tho Senate
having promptly taken the
mcasuro up, and the defeat of
Senator Harris' motion to lay on
tho table makes it absolutelv
certninth.it tho bill will pass fho
benalo substantially in its present
shap. lliiis tho democratic
predictions of division in the
republican ranks on thejturifrjbavc
boon effectually disposed of. The
only item in tho measure that is
not wholly approved of bv the
republicans, is thai jomoviug the
tax from alcohol used in manufact
ures and tho arts, and that is not
opposed, but somo republicans,
among them Senator Sherman,
have doubts as to whether tho
enforcing of that portion of the
bill will not have a tendency to
encourage fraud, But this doubt
will not cause them to vote
against that section on tho bill.
On the contrary they express them
selves anxious to see tho experi
ment tried, believing tho result
aimed at to be a good one.
Contrary to general expectation,
tho opening to Congress found
about two thirds of both Houses
in their seats. Mr. Cleveland's
message, tuough an unusually
long one, made little impression
on the members, owing largely to
the bad temper displayed in that
portion ot it relating to the tariff,
pension, and other Congressional
legislation. But the republican
members, who are feeling partic
ularly good, found little difficulty
in excusing nun lor the

It is also a potent fact, that
iimeiy-seven per cent or our peo
ple were farmers when the -protective
policy was first adopted,
and this class is still able to give
any shape it may desire to our na
tional policy. Many ot them
recollect what farming way under
a Free Trade system anrl nearly
all have experienced the improve
ment in their condition by the
growth of manufacture?; in their
vicinity.

Senator Vance made several
ineffectual attempts Io amend the
internal revenue section of the
Senate tariff bill in tho interest of
his "moonshiner" constituents,
whom he fears may be put in jail
by the new Federal officials, but
iho republicans promptly voted
them down, not being influenced
by tho fear of the "moonshiners"
votes.
A resolution has been offered
in the House making the postal

committee on rules, but it is not
thought that it will be possible to
get this bill up until late in the
session, if at all.

The recommendation of the
President's message as to n rec
iprocity treaty with Mexico, is
worthy of attention. However it
would hardly bo advisable to be
gin negotiations at tho close of a
retiring administration, which has
bungled every matter of diploma
cy it has attempted. However the
incoming administration should
devise n plan that will bo success
ful in greatly increasing tho trade
between tho United' States and

.Representative
one of the first
membeis to advocate an extra
session, thinks that the new Con
gress will meat in April; that if
will pass the present Senate tariff
bill (which ho does not think will
get through the present House;)
that it will admit South Dakota,
Montana and Washington Terri
tory, and pass an enabling act for
Dakota, and also thi.t it will per
fect somo general pension legis
lation. Continuing, Mr. Payson
said: 1 have no desire to conceid
our motive for admitting the
territories in the spring. "We
have a very small majority in
each House. More especially in
the Senate is it desirable that
this majority should be increased
in fho Fifty-first Confess.
These three Territories aie enti
tled to representation during the
now Congress. I think we should
admit these territories durinc an
extra spring session, so that thev
may be fully organized into States
and send six Senators and as
many Representatives as they are
entitled to, to bo regularly en
rolled as o part of the Fifty-first
Congress at the regular meeting
in December. This would give us
a good working majority in both
branches of Congress.
There are now four avowed
candidates in the field for the
speakership of the next House,
Messrs Peed, Mckinlej-, Cannon
and JJurrows; and tho friends of
each express themselves as con
fident of winning, but if the caucus
was to bo held now I doubt very
much whether any of them could
command a majority, so evenly
does their strength appear to be
devided. This will of course all
be changed as time goes on and
changes are made for various
reasons. The chances are, in my
opinion, that after the first ballot
m the caucus there will be only two
candidates, and thev will be Peed
and McKinley, and the chances of
election seems to bo slightly in
favor of McKinley, but not suf
ficiently so to make his selection
certain. There are several gentle
men that are being groomed as
dark horses, in the belief that
each of the leading candidates will
hold strength enough to prevent
either of the others receiving the
nomination. They all are good
men. No objection is mado to nnv
of them. It is simnlv a onpsHnn
of personal popularity that is to
no settled Dy caucus nomination.
