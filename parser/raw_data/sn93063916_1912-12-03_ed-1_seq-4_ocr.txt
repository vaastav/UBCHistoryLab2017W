First to Use Chloroform.
Chloroform an as anaesthetic wa3
first used on tbe 20th of September,
1546. by Dr. W. T. G. Morton, a den
tist, of Boston, in a case of tooth ex
traction, and thereafter by him ia
many difficult operations. The newg
of the discovery reached England fa
December, 1545, and British dentists
Immediately began to use it. Sir
James Simpson, a Scotch physician
(1S11-1ST0; was tbe first to use it ia
hospital practice and ti'3 be did In
1547. His discovery was considered
Independent of that by tie Boston
dentist and la 1SS6 he was knighted.
He had a public funeral whea he died
ftad s, statne cf him la bronze ttaads
la Edinburgh.

Considering bis meagre salary, it
was a mystery to economical parish

2nancial expert finally explained that
' x was a good Investment,
j "Tie money he contributes makes
i.iese entertainments so attractive,"
te said, "
ung people fall
: n love and marry, and he makes
pack many times o--r on the wddi:
! 'eee."
