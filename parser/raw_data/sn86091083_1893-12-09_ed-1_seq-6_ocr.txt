FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Status of the Difficulties iu Brazil, Hawaii
and Bering Sea.
While our foreign relations have not
at all times during the past year been
free from perplexing questions no em
barrassing situations remains that will
not yield to the spirit of fairness and
love of justice which, joined with con
sistent firmness, characterize a true
American policy.
THE BRAZILIAN AFFAIR.
Mv predecessor having accepted the
office of arbitrator of the long stand
ing boundary dispute, tendered to
the president by the Argentind Republic
and Brazil, it has been my agreeable
duty to receive the special envoys com
missioned by these states to try the
evidence and arguments in behalf of
their respective governments. The out
break of domestic hostilities in the re
public of Brazil found the United States
alert to watch the interests of our couu
try, with which we carry on important
commerce. Several vessels of our new
navy are now, and for some time have
been, stationed at Rio De Janeiro. The
struggle being between the established
government which controls the ma
chinery of administration and with
which we may retain friendly relations
and certain officers of the navy employ
ing the vessels of their command in an
attack upon the national capital and
chief seaport, and lacking as it does the
elements of divided administration, I
nave failed to see that the insurgents
can reasonably claim recognition as be
ligerents. Thus the position of our gov
ernment has been that of an attentive
but impartial observer of the unfortu
nate conflict. Emphasizing -our fixed
policy of impartial neutrality in such a
condition of affairs as now exists, I
deemed it necessary to disavow in a
manner not to be misunderstood, the
unauthorized action of the late naval
commander of these waters in saluting
the revolutionary Brazilian admiral, be
ing indisposed to countenance an .act
calculated to give gratuitous sanction to
the local insurgents.
The convention between our govern
ment and Chili, having for its object
the settlement and adjustment of the
demands of the two countries against
each other, has been made effective by
the organization of tne claims commis
sion provided for. The two governments
failing to agree upon the third member
of the commission, the good offices of
the president of the Swiss republic
were invoked a3 provided in the treaty
and the selection of the Swiss repre
sentative in the country to complete
the organization was gratifying to the
United States and Chili.
The legislation last year known as
the Geary law, requiring the registra
tion of all Ghinese laborers entitled to
residence in the United States and the
deportation of all not complying with
the provisions of the act within the time
described, met with much opposition
from Chinamen in this country. Acting
upon the advice of the eminent counsel
that the law was unconstitutional, the
great mass of Chinese laborers pending
judicial inquiry as to its validity in good
faith declined to apply for their cer
titicates required by its provisions. A
test upon proceeding by habeas corpus
was brought before the supreme, court
and on May 15, 1893, decision was made
by that tribunal sustaining the law. It
is believed unaerthe recent amendment
of the act extending the time for régis
tration that the Chinese laborers there
to entitled who desire to reside in this
country will now avail themselves of
, the renewed privilege thus afforded by
establishing by lawful procedure their
right to remaim and that thereby the
necessity of enforced deportation may
to a great degree be avoided.
THE BERING SEA QUESTION.

The questions affecting our relations
with Great Britain have been treated
in a spirit of friendliness. Negotiations
are in progress between the two gov

Just prior to the in
stallation of the present administration
the existing government of Hawaii had
been suddenly overthrown, and a treaty
of annexation had been negotiated be
tween the provisional government for
the islands and the United States and
bmitted to the senate for ratification,
This treaty I withdrew for examination
and dispatched Hon. James H. Blount of
Georgia to Honolulu as a special com
missioner to make an impartial investi
gation of the circumstances attending
the change of government and of all i
conditions bearing upon the subject of \
thctieaty. After a thorough and ex
haustive examination Mr. Blount sub
mitted to me his report showing beyond
all question that the constitutional gov- j
ernment of Hawaii had been subverted
with the active aid of our représenta- j
tive to that government and through
the intimidation caused by the presence ,
of an armed naval force of the United j
States which was landed for that pur
pose at the instance of our minister. |
Upon the facts developed it seemed to j
that the only honorable course for
our government to pursue was to undo
the wrong that had been done by those
representing us and to restore, as far as
practicable, the state existing at the
time of our forcible intervention. With
a view of accomplishing tills result with
iu the constitutional limits of executive
power, and recognizing all our oblige
tions and responsibilities growing out
of any changed conditions brought
about by our unjustifiable interference,
present minister at Honolulu has
received appropriate instructions to
that end. Thus far information of the
accomplishments of any definite results
have not been received from him. Ad

THE NAVY DEPARTMENT.
The Progress of National Ship Building
Is Encouraging,
The report of the secretary of the navy
coutains a history of the operations of his
department during the past year and exhib
its a most gratifying condition of the per
sonnel of our navy. He presents a satisfactory
account of the progress which has been made
in the construction of vessels and makes a
number of recommendations to which a men
tion is specially invited.
Since 1880 congress has at each session
authorized the building of one or more ves
sels, and the secretary of the navy presents
an earnest plea for the continuance of this
plan. He recommends the authorization of
at, least one battleship and six torpedo boats.
While 1 am distinctly in favor of consistently
pursuing the policy we have inaugurated of
building up a thorough und efficient navy, I
cannot refrain from the suggestion that
congrtss should carefully take into account
the number of unfinished vessels on our
hands and the depleted condition of our
treasury iu consideiing the propriety of an
appropriation at • this time to begin new
work.
The method of employing mechanical labor
at navy yards through boards of labor and
making efficiency the sole test by which lab
orers are employed and continued is produc
ing the best results and tbe secretary is
learnesiy devoting liimselfto its development.
Attention is invited to the statements of his
report in regard to the workings of the
system.
DEPARTAIENT OF THE INTERIOR
Discussion of Subjects of Especial Interest
to This Section.
The secretary of the interior lias the super
vision of so many importaut subjects that
his report is of especial value and interest.
On tin, 30th day of June. 1898, there were
on t he pension roils 990,012 names.
The number added to the rolls during the
year was 123,084 and the number dropped
was 88,680. /File first payments on pen
sions during the year amouneed to $33,57(5,
549.98. This includes arreurs or the accu
mulation between the time from which the
allowance of pensions dates and the time of
actually granting the certificate.
Of the net increase there were seventeen
widows and daughters ol revolutionary sol
diers. eighty-six survivors of the war of 1812.
5,425 widows of soldiers of that war, 21,518
survivor and widows of the Mexican war,
3,882 survivors and widows of the Indian
wars, 284 army nurses, and 47.504 survivors
and w idows and children of deceased soldiers
and sailors cf the war of the rebellion.
The latter number represents those pen
sioned on account of death or disabilities re
sulting from army and navy service,
number of persons remaining on the rolls
June 30, 1893, who were pensioned under the
act of June 27, 1890. which allows peusion
on account of death and disability not
chargeable to army service was 459,155.
FRAUDS IN PENSION ROLLS.
I am unable to understand why frauds in
the pension rolls should not be exposed and
corrected with thoroughness and vigor
Everyone fraudulently put on these rolls is a
tvickid imposition upon the kindly sentiment
in which pensions have their origin. Every
fraudulent pensioner lies become a bad citi
zen. Every false oath in support of a pen
sion makes perjury more common. Thous
ands of neighborhoods have well-known
fraudulent pensioners and recent develop
ments by the bureau established appalling
conspiracies to accomplish pension frauds.
By no uipans the least wrong done is to
brave and deserving pensioners, who cer
tainly ought not to be condemned to such
association Those who attempt in the line
ot duty to rectify these wrongs should not be
accused of enmity or indifference to the
claims of honest veterans. The sum ex
pended on account of pensions for the year
ending June 30, 1893, was $150,740,467 14.
The commissioner estimates that $165,000,
000 will lie required to pay the pensions
during the year ending June 30, 1894.
CONDITION OF THE INDIANS.
Tlie condition of the Indians and their ulti
mate fate are subjects which strongly appeal
to tlie sense of justice und sympathy of the
people.
Our Indians number about 248,000. Most
of them are located on 101 reservations.
86,115,581 acres of land. About 110,000
of these Indians have to a large degree
adopted civilized customs. Lands in severalty
have been alloteed to many of them.
Such allotment has been made to 10,000 in
dividuals during the past fiscal year, em
bracing about 1,000,000 acres. The number
of Indian government schools open during
the year was 195, an increase of twelve over
the preceding year. Of this total 170 were
on reservations, of which 73 were hoarding
schools and 97 were day schools. Twenty
boarding schools and five day schools sup
ported by the government were not located
on reservations.
The total number of Indian children en
rolled during the year as attendants of all
schools was 21,138, an increase of 1,231 over
the enrollment of ths previous year.
SECULAR ANU MORAL TRAINING.
I am sure that secular education and moral
and religious teaching must be important
factors in any effort to save the Indian and
lead him to civilization. I believe, too, that
The
as
the relinquishment of tribal relations and the
holding of land in severalty iu favorable con
ditions aid this consummation. It seems to
me. however, that allotments of land should
lie made with great care and circumspection.
The appropriations ou account of the In
dian bureau for the year ending June 3(t,
1*1*4. amount to 7.057,902.00, a decrease as
compared with the year preceding of
$389,131.95.
FORESTRY AND AGRICULTURE.
I especially recommend to the attention of
congress the statements contained iu r he
secretary's report eoncern'ng forestry. Tin
time has come when efficient men-tires should
be taken for the preservation of our forests
from indiscriminate and wanton destruction
Tne report of the secretary of agriculture
will be found exceedingly interesting, espe
cially to thst. large part of our citizens inti
mately concerned iu agricultural occupations.
On the 7th day of March, 1898, there were
upon the pay rolls 2,480 employes. This
number has been reduced to 1,850 persons.
In view of a depleted public treasury and the
imperative demand of the people for economy
iu the administration of their government,
the secretary lias entered upon 1 he task of
radically reducing expenditures by the elimi
nation from the pay rolls of all parsons not
needed for an efficient conduct of the affairs
of the department. During thy first quarter
of the present year the expenses of the de
partment aggregated $345,97(5,76 asuRaiiist
8402,021.42 for the cm responding period of
the fiscal year ending June 80, 1898.
EXPORTS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.
The exports of agricultural products from
the United States for the fiscal year ending
June 80, 1892. attained the enormous figure
of $800,000 in round numbers, being 78.7 Of
our total exports.
iuihelast fiscal year this aggregate was
greatly reduced, but nevertheless $050.000.
000. being 75.1 per cent- of all .1 merican c
modifies exploit<id. A review oi our agricul
tural exports, with special reference to their
destination will show that in almost, every
line the United Kingdom of Great Britian
and Ireland absorbs by far the largest pro
portion of cattle. The total exports aggre
gated in value for the fiscal vear ending June
80, 1898, $26.000,000, of which
Britain took considerably over $25,000,000.
Of beef products of all kiuds our total ex
ports were $28,000,000, of which Great
Britain took $24,000,000.
Of pork products the total exports were
$84.000,000, of which Great Britain took
$38,000,000. In breadstuff«, cotton and
minor products a tike proportion sent to the
same destination is shown.
INFORMATION for FARMERS.
The work of the» statistical division of the
department of agriculture deals with all that
relates to the economies of farming. The
main purpose of its monthly reports is to
keep the farmers informed as fully as possible
of all matters having any iniiuence upon the
world's markets in which their products find
a sale. Its publication relates especially to
the commercial side of fanning.
It is therefore of profound importance and
concern to the farmers of the United States,
who represent nearly half our population,
and also of dfreet interest to the whole coun
try that the work of this brunch lie efficiently
performed and that the information it lias
gathered be promptly diffused, it is a mat
ter for congratulation to know- that the sec
retary will not spare any effort to make this
part of his work thoroughly useful.
A STROKE OF ECONOMY.
In the year 1889 the congress appropriated
$1,000 to be taken from the patent office
tuml for the purpose of collecting and dis
tributing rare and improved varieties of seeds
for prosecuting agricultural investigations
and procuring agricultural statistics. From
this small beginning the seed division of the
department lias grown to its present unwieldy
and unjustifiably extravagant proportions.
During the last fiscal year the cost of seeds
purchased was $0(5,048 61, The remainder
of the appropriation of $135,000 is expended
in putting them up and distributing them.
In view of these facts, this enormous en
penditure without legitimate returns or ben
efit ought tc be abolished. Anticipating a
cousu motion so manifestly in (he interests of
good administration, mors than $100.000
has been stricken from the estimate made to
cover this object for the year ending June 80,
1895.,

CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
The continual execution of the civil service
law, and the increasing approval of the peo
ple of its operation are most gratifying. The
recent extension of its limitations and regu
lations to the employes at free delivery post
offices which has been honestly and promptly
accomplished by the commission, with tlie
hearty co-operation of the postmaster gen
eral, is an immensely important advance in
the usefulnesi of the system. I um, if possi
ble, more than ever convinced of the incalcu
lable benefits conferred by the civil service
law not only in its effect upon the public ser
vice. but also what is more important in its
effect in elevating tbe tone of political life
generally._
TAXATION AND REVENDE.
Economy Urged iu the Use of the Pub
lic Money.
Economy in public expenditures ii a duty
that cannot beinnocently neglected by those
entrusted with the control of money drawn
from t he people for public oses. It must lie
confessed that our apparently endless re
sources, the familiarity of our people with
immense accumulation of wealth, tlie grow
ing sentiment among them that the expendi
ture of money should be in some manner to
their immediate and personal advrntage, the
direct and almost stealthy manner in which
a large part of our taxes u'e exacted and a
degenerated sense of official accountability,
have led to growing extravagance iu gov
ernmental appropriations.
At this time a depleted publie treasury con
fronts us and many of our people are
engaged iu a hard struggle for the necessaries
of life. As enforced economy is pressingupon
I he great mass of our count rymen I desire to
urge with all the earnestness at my com
mand. that congressional legislation be so
limited by strict economy as to exhibit au
appreciation of the condition of the treasury
m sympathy with the strained circumstances
of oar feiloiv citizens. Tbe duty of publie
economy is also of immense importance in
its intimate and necessary relation to the
task now in hand of providing for revenue to
meet government expenses and yet reducing
the people's burden oi federal taxation.
REFORM OF THE TARIFF.
After a hard struggle tariff reform is di
rectly before us. Nothing so important
claims our attention and nothing so clearly
presents itself as both an opportunity and a
