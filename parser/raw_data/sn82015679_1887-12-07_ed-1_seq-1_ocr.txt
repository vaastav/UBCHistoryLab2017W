Grievances of Milwaukee Railway Firemen
and Looomotlf Enelne.
' Milwaukee. Dec. 6. Two hundred switeh
neo, from every yard in the city, net at coon
to-day. J. M. Monaehan, president of the
National Switchmens' Union, was present and
ddrs?atL men. He ccuuaeled r&odsrtioa
and advised the men not to strike, and said they
would eventually set what they wanted. The
general sentiment of those present seemed to be
Against a strike.
The locomotive engineers also have a griev
ance, and a committee of the National Brother
hood is in the city to investigate the matter.
Their complaint is that in many cases after a
fireman has worked on an engine two or three
years, he is placed in charge of an engine and
paid $2-25 per day, while the regular engineers
will not work for less than $3.50 per day. The
engineers claim that these promotions of fire
men are getting too frequent and that experi
enced men are kept oau of employment.
The molders in the Wisconsin malleable iron
works went oat on strike to-day to enforce
ft rule in regard to apprentices. .
Chicago Printers Will Fight.
Chicago, Dec, 6. In response to a caII of the
no ion for a special meeting to discuss the atti
tude of the employers, who demand that union
printers desiring employment shall sign an
agreement withdrawing from the union, 700
union printers assembled to-night, and unani
mously resolved to fight the Typotbetae to the
bitter end. Every "chapel in the citv was rep
rented, including the newspaper offices. The
delegates of each reported their chapel as will
ing to stand almost any assessment to continue
the contest. A committee of fifteen was ap
pointed to wait upon every trade organization
and every Knight of Labor assembly in the city
and solicit moral and financial support. Meas
ures were taken to arrange an entertainment
for tbe benefit of the strikers, and a movement
was inaugurated to present the case from a
union stand-point to all the labor papers through
out the country, and enlist active help of the
International Typographical Union
Strike of Glass-Workers Threatened.
Pittsburg, Dec 6. Tbe trouble between

Flint-glass Workers Union, which has been go

REDUCE THE TARIFF
So says the President. A popular Christmas
cry, that! Everybody wants the "tariff re
duced, so as to make the holiday money go as
far as possible. We know that. We have
acted on the knowledge. In such seasonably
suitable things as plush boxes for collars,
cuffs and handkerchiefs we have a large lot of
new designs, and we have reduced the tariff
on them rifcht down to wholesale prices for the
single purchase.
An "esteemed contemporary ' in the cloth-
ins business advertises:
"WHEN CLOTHING IS
So awfully cheap that everybody proposes to
sell cheaper than others, then be slow in de
ciding:." That's right "When Clothing" is awfully
cheap, and others propose to seli cheaper, but
(as they are slow in deciding), while the other
fellow proposes THE WHEN disposes, and is
selling clothing awfully cheap. Same as to
bats.

EXCITING ELECTION AT LOUISVILLE.
Jacoh Easily Defeats Two Opposition Can
didate and a Coapls of Newspapers.
Special to the Indianaoolis Journal.
Louisville, Dec 6. Tbe election of Mayor
here to-day was a very hotly contested and Re
live one, notwithstanding the Tote as finally
counted was by no means close. Jacob, Demo-vc-r
V fcP tvznayosf , and until recently
United States Minister to Bogota; Judge Hoke,
Democrat, was the Courier-Journal candidate,
and' Avery was the Republican nominee. The
present city administration was bitterly opposed
to Jacob. Jacob was said to be backed by the
Rich Gas Company, which is now seeking a new
and exclusive charter, and was supplied with
unlimited money. The result was a contest
whose desperation bas never been equalled in
Louisville. Every means available bas
been used for the past two months
to gain an advantage. Avery and Hoke tried to
encase Jacob in an aa agreement not to use
money, which the latter declined, but stated he
would not use money himself nor encourage it.
Bis opponents then entrapped Scott Newman, a
political boss boodler, and a Jacob sapDorter,
into offering a man $100 for election purposes
while a stenographer and witnesses were am
bushed in the next room. A citizens' meeting
was held last week at which a committee of
eight was appointed and a fund of $5,000 raised
to prevent bribery at the polls. This com
mittee employed detectives and made over
one hundred arrests to-dav, among them
a councilman, but could cot stem
the tide of corruption indulged in almost with
out limit by the candidate's friends. The whole
city went wild. The clerk of the city court and
his deputies left their office to electioneer for
Jacob, and when the citizens' committee applied
to have warrants 'issued the city judge was
forced to adjourn bis court, take the clerk's
desk and isbue the warrants himself. His first
warrant was one for the arrest of the rebellious
clerk.
A peculiar feature of the election was that the
present police force was largely for Jacob, and
openly defied their chief's orders, who sought to
counteract their influence by swearing in 300
special policemen, at the suggestion of the citi
zens' committee, who, in turn, worked desper
ately against Jacob, while the regular
fore did the same in his favor.
The Jacob party controlled the record intr of
votes at each precinct in the citv, having se
cured the appointment of all the clerks, and it is
charged, in many cases, that votes were re
corded for Jacob when cast for one of the other
candidates. Many members of the police force
will be dismissed for insubordination and neg
lect of dutv. The resnit of the election was:
Jacob, 11.0G9; Avery, 5.233; none, 3,2GS. It is
said that the arrests for bribing voters will be
used as a means for cou testing Jacob's election.

RUSSIA AND AUSTRIA.
Indications that the Czar Intends Making
War Against His Neighbor.
Viexna, Dec 6. The Fremenblatt says:
"The military measures of Russia upon the
Austrian frontier are totally at variance with
tbe general desire for peace, and the hopes
thereof caused by the Imperial meeting at Ber
lin, and we must wait and sea to what extent
tbe Berlin meeting will influence tbe measures,
which were possibly decided upon under differ
ent apprehensions. The recent speech from the
German throne, in which the Emperor stated
that the empire was not inclined to disturb the
peace of its neighbors, is sufficient for Austria,
and any further gathering of Russian soldiers
on our frontier should compel us to adopt simi
lar measures, in order that we might not be be
hind Russia's preparations, which are threaten
ing and totally unprovoked."
Tbe Berlin Post says: "The report of tbe as
sembling of Russians on tbe Galician frontier
evoke apprehensions of a blow against' Austria.
Whether that blow which is not intended with
tbe view of attaining ends wherein Germany
has never opposed Russia, but for other,
further-reaching purposes will admit Ger
many's remaining at peace for any length of
time, is a question which doubtless Russia has
long since answered."
- Tbe Berlin bourse was weak and irregular to
day on aecount of the unfavorable view taken
by the Pester-Lloyd of the relations between
Auatria and Russia. Russian securities of 1871
and 1873 receded i percent, and other foreign
securities H per cent.
It is rumored that Germany and Austria have
Bent a joint note to St. Petersburg asking the
Russian government to explain Its massing of
troops on the frontiers of the former countri es.
IRISH AFFAIRS.
.ord Mayor Sullivan Keurioved from Dublin
to the Tullamore Jail.
Dubliit, Dec 6. Tbe removal of Lord Mayor
T. D. Sullivan from Dab.in to Tullamore, which
was ordered to-day, was an act of petty persecu
tion which is beneath contempt. Ostensibly the
change was made to prevent the Lord Mayor
from holding receptions in the jail, which it was
claimed, partook of the character of ovations to
the distinguished prisoner, but the real object
cf tbe removal was to make, bis term of incarcer
ation as unpleasant, and impose
npon. hint - -ns -- much; - hii Jsnls ' a
pcesible, since bis sentence does cot
permit bis keepers to exact his performanoe of
labor. The Dublin magistrates will continue
their visits to Mr. Sullivan, however, there be
ing no way in which they can legally be pre
vented. Mr. Sullivan is still Lord Mayor of
Dublin, and in such capacity cannot be de
barred from consultation with the magistrates
of the city, nor can tbe latter be denied the
right to confer with their superior officer.
Tbe police are actively endeavorine to arrest
Mr. Gilhooly, member of Parliament for Cork,
who bas taken refuge with Mr. Pyne in Lisfinny
castle, which is prepared to defy the police.
Mr. Gilhooly, it is believed, intends to escape
from the castle to-night.

Paris. Dec 6. It is expected that M. Goblet 1

that M. Flourens will retain the portfolio of
Minister of Foreign Affairs.
The Chambers have adjourned until Satur

President Sadi-Carnot, in an interview with

Clemenceau fully indorsed the President's views.
The accord between President Sadi Carnot and
M. Clemenceau is regarded as a good omen of
the future of tbe republic During the inter

be was nndr no illusion that he had been
chosen President for his own merits. He had
an earnest desire to do his duty and sink self on

conflict with the public interest. While admit
ting that there must always exist two great
Republican parties, the President said
it would be possible, In elections,
for them to unite against their common enemy,
the Monarchists. M. Clemenceau, replying,
deprecated the idea of taking men from tbe va

DEFIANT MR. PYXE.
Tie Has Shut IHiuielf Up In His Castle and
Sends Defiance to the Authorities.
Dublin ( able Special.
Mr. Pyne, member from West Wterford,
bas shut himself np in Liafinny Castle, which
he re-.ts from the Duke of Devonshire, the
father of Lord Hartington. He has abundance
of provisions and a liberal supply of liquors. He
has been some weeks in voluntary confinement.
During that period be bas had deputations from
public boards and delivered addresses to assem
bled admirers. They cannot penetrate to his
chamber, which is tenanted by himself and a
faithful male friend, and is at an altitude of
about seventy feet from terra firm a. He talks'
down to them and they cheer up at him.
Occasionally he lowers himself by a rope, and
hauls himself up by the same rope, which dos
dutv, also, in taking his letters up to him d uly.
But these descents he seldom makes. It is no
secret that he is located in this fortress. The
fact is known to all the world. 116 hurls his
challenges periodically at the authorities, dar
ing them to attack him. Police have moved to
bi3 vicinity and moved away again. The mili
tary have been nnder orders' to lay siege to the
fortress, and tbe orders have been counter
manded. Ia a word, the authorities are be
wildered. Mr. Pyne is forty years of age, and an English
Protestant In advance he expresses sympathy
with the noliceman told to lead the attack. I
wonld not like to be him." said he. laconically.
Lisnnnv Castle is not a mere place of abode. It
is in structure a castle capable of being put into
a state of defense, and is on the border line of
Waterford and Cork, and not far from Tallow.
There is nothing very formidable in Pyne's de
fenses. They are not as impregnable aa Gib
raltar, or as invulnerable as Metz or Strasbourg,
but they are suficiontly strong to render force
necessary in order to effect his capture, and the
exercise of this force is the one thing that he is
ambitions of provoking.
The walls of Lisfinny rise to a height of one
hundred feet Thev are pierced with the nar
row windows usually to be sen in castle or
turrets, and are almost covered with ivy. Mr.
Pyne is in excellent form and in great heart
He can hold out he says, until Parliament
meets, and is quite as well in bis own castle as
in Mr. Balfour's prison. He, therefore, elects to
remain in his castle, and means to resist with
all bis might any and every attempt to drag
him out

'r SLEEP-WALKER IX PERIL.
Kemarkable Feats of a Woman on the llonse
Top and in the Cemetery.
WhjX53Arre, Pa., Dec 6. A remarkable
case of somnambulism is reported in this city.
Sirs. Rebecca Eldridge is the proprietor of a
private boarding-house on North Main street.
Several times she has left her bed and walked
aro end the house in. her sleep, but until last
weeU never left tho dwelling.
Ou. Tuesday last Mrs. Eldridge got out of
her led while in one of her somnambulant fits
and tvalked down stairs with a prayer book in
her liands. Just aa she was going out the front
door phe was met by one of her boarders
namod Stewart, a printer, just returning from
work. Stewart caught the woman by the
arm and led her back in the house. It was
sonvj hours beforo she could be aroused, and
whcnslie did come to her senses she stated that
she did not know what had happened her but
t.at she thought she was on her way to
church.
On Wednesday morning she had a far more
serious and startling experience. It was about
3a.ii; when Mr. Stewart returned home and
the weather was intensely cold. He had let
himself in and was proceeding to bed: when ho
noticed that Mrs. Eldridge's bed-room was open,
and a moment later he found that the trap-door
from Ibe attic to the roof was wido oreu. He
instantly surmised that Mrs. Eldrhlge had gone
out on the root' in a state of sleep-waltting. Ho
at cice made the ascent and looked out of the
trap Moor.
To bis consternation he saw her standing on
the roof cf W. L. LooraKs house, next door.
She had gained the roof of her own house, and
then must havo stepped or jumped an interven
ing spaco of fully three feet between the houses,
a feat which even a tuan would hesitate to do
in the night, and a feat which cot one woman ia
a hundred would have essayed in anything but
a life and denth emergency.
Sho vas standing on tho roof as before, with
nothing on but her night dress, with the ,ther
no,Kcter twelve degrees below freezing. She
had, two bundles of dress goods under her arm.
Mr? Stewart was in a quandary. To call to her
arj?. PjvpVyn her in the position she occupied
- " "jr1 m ber deMb, as in the alarm of
avl. thug and finding herself in such a situation
th?r"pances were that she would fall and be
killed on the pavement below.
H'j did not know what to do. He went back
into the house, and while deliberating as to the
best course to pursue, he was delighted to see
Mrs. Eldridgo coming back into the house
through the trap, having once more crossed the
space between the houses. In reply to his in
quiries as to what she was doing she said that
she had to go to the dress-maker's. She was
again put to bed, and woke up a few hours later
none the worse for her experience and without
the slightest remembrance of the adventure.
Yesterday morning when Mr. Stewart got
home, at 2:20. he found the front door open, and
at once concluded that Mrs. Eldridge had been
taken with another somnambulistic fit, and was
wandering through the streets. He ran up
stairs and aroused the family, who found that
the mother was not in bed. Hor son George
was called, and after notifying the police to be
on the iookout for her, started out in search of
her.
They found her in the city cemetery. She
had nothing on but. a night dress and bonnet.
She was engaged iu prayer. She was nearly
frozen stiff, and a phys ieian says she has sus
tained a shock whkh will probably result in her
death. The doctors say it is the most remark
able case on record. There have been cases
where people have walked in their sleep for
short distances, but never for whole hours. In
Mrs. Eldridge's case she walked in her sleep
from her house to the cemetery, a distance of
two mil'3s.
JOHN L. IX FAY0R WITH NOBILITY.
lie Is Iieinsr Treated Eojally in England, and
Will Take Care of "Sean town."
Botov, Dec. 6. That champion Sullivan is
having a good time in England will bo seen
from the following letter published here this
morning:
"I have been received in this country with
flj-ing colors, and in a manner which 1 did not
expect. Since my arrival here I have been
dined by tho Marquis of Salisbury and also by
lords and dukes. 1 have also been made a mem
ber of the Pelican Club, an honor which I esteem
very highly and which other Americans have
been unable to procure. I have met and talked
with Jem Smith, tho wonder of this country. I
have seen him spar and have measured him by
what I have seen. You can inform my friends
at home that they need not fear the outcome of
the meeting between Smith and myself. If wo
meet it will add another to my record of victo
ries. He is a good man; but I don't fear him in
the least; in fact. I doubt if they will match him
to fight me. All bis manager seems to want is a
four-round 'go with tho gloves, and if that is
the best he will agree to I must be satisfied. I
will try and bring the match about before he
meets Kilrain. I will take care of 'Beantown
while I am here. It is the only place on the
globe, and the home of your royal highness, John
L. Sullivan.
4 'By the way. I want to tell yon that I have
been called upon to spar before his Royal High
ness, the Prince of Wales, and you may hear
from me in that connection before my next let
ter. 1 have never been treated better in my life
than I have been since my arriv;d here, and I
havo nothing to complain of as far as tho public
or press is concerned.' The proprietors and
editors of the Sportsman have spoken of me in
the kindest of terms, and given me every facil
ity. Everybody seems to consider my style of
boxing a revelation. Mitchell keeps giving the
same old bluff, and I am after him pi-etty hot.
I will drive him out or shut him up beforo I re
turn My opinion is that the fight between Kil
rain and Smith will never come olf. If it does
tke place I will be there to see it. I want to
say now that my sympathy is all with Kilrain,
although he has made some bluffs at me within
three months. I shall havo a champion in Jack
Ashton. and shall match him to fight anyone.
He is a smart young fellow and will make all the
pugilists over here hustle, and will be able to
dispose of anybody when I am through with
him.
;P. S. Good-bye and good luck. My good reso

"Senatorial courtesy," which has usually led
to the compliment of a confirmation without ref

Senator bas been nominated to any other office,
bas never prevailed m respect to nominations to
positions on the bench of the Supreme Court
Tbe last case preceding that of Mr. Lamar was
that of Mr. Conklinp, who bad been out of the
Senate a much shorter period than has Mr. La
mar. Mr. Conkling's nomination was sent to
the judiciary committee and reported back. He
was confirmed by tbe Senate, and then declined
the office. It is probable that the nominations
sent to tbe Senate to-day will not be formally
laid before the body until the committees are
formed.
WHAT THEY THINK OF IT.
Opinions of Prominent Kepubllcans on the
Message of the President.
IFor Text of President' Meisage, Sec Fourth rage.
Cpecie.i to tbe Indiananolis Journal.
Washington, Dec C President Cleveland's
message was a. great surprise to Republicans
and universally a disappointment to Democrats.
Tbe Republicans were surprised to see the ad
ministration and the Democratic party so readi
ly favor free trade; the Democrats were disap
pointed in finding none of the recommendations
in tbe message which they bad implored the
Chief Magistrate to make. Republicans are
frank to admit their delight over the character
of tbe message. The comments made by Sena
tor Wn. E. Chandler, late Secretary of the Na
vy, and Senator Hiscock, of New York, indicate
very thoroughly the drift of opinion of the prin
cipal men of the Republican party. Seaator
Chandler said: "Tne message delight rue, be
cause it openly announces the principles of the
Democratic party. The administration is for
free trade. If the party will only indorse the
message and stand by ii, we can sweep the coun
try next year. I am afraid the whole thing will
be repudiated."
Senator Hiscock said: "We can carry New
York by at least 30,000 majority if tbe Demo
crats will only stand upon that platform; tho
Republicans want nothing better."
Representative McKinley, of Ohio, who i3 one
cf tbe principle members of the committee on
W.-.T3 and means, said: "lam clad tne Demo
cratic party bas at last been driven into a bole
where it has been compelled to show its hand.
It is now free trade again? t protection to oar
industries."
Quite a large number ot Democrats senators
and members refuse, to-night, to exprces an
opinion upon tbe -message. It is readily seen
that they are very slow to indorse it The
party in Congress will b quite as much split up
on the question of icdomng the message as on
reform of tbe tariff. Ohioans are raging
furiously over the reference to free wood, while
Southerners are mad because there was no allu
sion to the abolition of internal revenue taxes.
The Republicans of the Indiana delegation ex
press delight that the administration bas at last
come out and fathered the principles ot the
Democratic party and acknowledge the work it
has been covertly doing. General Browne and
Major Steele are confident that the message will
very greatly assisst the Republican party, not
only in Indiana, but in Ohio, and, in fact,
throughout the country.
General Hovey said: "The President bas en
tirely ignored the soldiers and shifts all respon
sibility. It is a very poor message, and will
help the Reoublican party in Indiana."
Captain White said: "A miserable rehash of
an old subject, but I am glad to see the Presi
dent enow his hand for free trade. If he had
only kept wiihin the bounds of truth in compil
ing, his figures in favor of free trade, he would
have made a better argument We have ex
ploded it all, long ago. It is a mistake to say
that the way to get rid of the surplus is by re
ducing the tariff. There is a very large element
that would like some of the surplus and need it
in the form of pensions. The message caters to
the financial interest."
Mr. Owen said: ''It is a characteristic mes
sage, written, as usual, on the line ot a stump
speech. Its assault upon tbe tariff consists of
the absurd figuriugof free-traders. The demand
efor free wool and the siience on the sugar ques
tion, wneu there ars millions of wool-growers in
America, and but 17,000 sugar producers, will
not quite meet the better judgment of the peo
ple. The statesmen of the country are for a re
duction of the toDacoo tax."
The New York Press.
New York. Dec G. Tne Times, in its edi
torial on the President's message, will say: "Mr.
Cleveland has done an act of statesmanship in
tbe best sense. Recognizing a great duty, be
has performed it with courage, with firmness,
and at the right time. And he has performed it
so that every honest man mast see that it is an
honest act Judged by any ordinary
standard of political expediency, the President's
act is inexpedient. He bas forced upon his
party an issue as to which the party is divided,
and so divided that unless the minority yield,
it can defeat the will of the majority. He bas
done this on the eve of a national contest
in which a considerable cumber of men
of iofluence in the party has been
urging him to avoid this issue and threatening
bim and the party with disaster if he did not
avoid it. On the other band, there is cotbiug
in this issue, thus presented, by which Mr.
Cleveland could hope to draw from the Repub
lican party any votes. Nor this alone;
for if the protectionist faction in the Democratic
party carry out their own, desires, or do what
they have continually declared they would do,
Mr. Cleveland has done the one thing by which
be could imperil tbe prospeetof his own renomi
nation. It places Mr. Cleveland far above any
of tbe leaders to whom the Republican party
bas of late lent a hearing, and above most of
tbe Ualers of his own party."
The Sun will say: '-It is cot a commonplace
document for it is simple. intl'ieibl. and co
herent, and the quality of brevity is chiefly dne
to the fact that all other topics of natiooal in
terest are dismissed in a lump or postponed as
inconsequential in the presence of one problem
of supreme importance tbe question of tariff
revision. " n declare that tbe theoret.
ical question as bettr esa protection and free
trade is 'entirely irrelevant and yet the roost
striking and interesting part of the message ia
devoted to piecisely that sort of an argnmenl
with which any free-trade repreeentttive ic
Congress, or any free-trade professor in a col
lege class-room, cr the author of any
frre-trade text-book on political economy, would
begin an attack upon the theory of protection.
This. we say, is the most notabl
fact about the message. Mr. Cleveland bas
never before in a public paper taken sides
squarely upon this question. He has done so
now in a manner that leavos room for no misun
derstanding. It is a bold thing to do, and the
President deserves credit forth plainness of
his speech. No body ean accuse him of hedging,
or haggling, or juggling with words. So far
does he go upon th familiar lines of the free
trade speeches in Congress or elsewhere that w
find him betrayed here and there, no doubt un
consciously, into an exhibition of slight irrita
tion against American manufacturer as a
class, almost as if they were conspirator and
public enemies. "
Tbe Tribune says: "For the first time in tb
country's history the President's annual message)
omits all reference to the many grave public in
terests, respecting which good citizens of all
parties agree, and is exclusively devoted to an
issue between parties. President Cleveland
gives Congress no information about tbe fishery,
qnestion. the pending negotiations with
Great Britain, or relations with othex.
foreign powers. The nearest . p-.
proacb to this strange performance in
the annual messages of previous Presidents was
when Mr. Buchanan devoted most of bis ces
sage to a defeose of bis policy in Kansas. Tha
precedent can hardly be considered attractive,,
in the light of its results. President Cleveland
seems refreshingly unaware that his entire,
message is inspired by extreme free-trad theo
ries. It seems never to tava
occurred to th President that foreign
prices are, in fact, to a large extent
controlled by the American demand.
It is hard to understand bow the President -reconciles
his statements respecting the surplus t
revenue with official reports of bis subordinates. .
The Treasury Department bas within a week re
ported that the currency of all kinds in circula
tion, outside the treasury, is $.12. 000.000 mora
than it was five months ago, and 119,000,000
more than it was seventeen months ago. and yet
the President affirms that 'a withdrawal from
U6e of the people's circulating medium' has
'lately subjected the business community to
distress' " But the President's gravest
error is the unfounded assumption that a need
ful reduction of revenue can best be attained by'
lowering duties, and thus inviting larger iaa--portatmns.
It is a message which hi'
political friends will keenly regret, and which
they will labor to explain awav when they come
to confront the voters next fall."
The H.-rald will say: ''The message is as
able, conservative and statesmanlike document,
which, unlike many other messages, will be
read by the peonle aud 4'scoJIK by them. We
are glad to see that he favors fre wool, wbicb
would give greatly increased and . permanent
prosperity to our great woolen industry, and en
able ourj manufacturer in other branches at
the same time to dispose of large quantities of
their products iu wool-producing countries, te
the immediate benefit of workmen in almost all
branches of American manufactures. Th
measure will not please extremists of either
side, free-traders or protectionists, bat it will,
w believe, piesse and satisfy the people at
large, and it puts upon both parties in Conresi
the solemn duty to relieve the country from
most serious danger" t
The World wiil say: 'Tbe admirable mes
sage of the President has given to the Demo
cratic party what it has long lacked an issut
and a leader. Tne issue is tax reform. Th
leader is the President It can hardly
be that tbe President has not, at this juncture,
influence enough to secure the -union of the
Democrats in the House upon a measure ol
revenue reduction and tariff reform."
English Opmlon.
Lontx). Deo. 6. The synopsis of President
Cleveland' message to Congress, which was
cabled here and published in the afternoon pa
pers, was read with a great deal of interest Toe
message, which is regarded generally as impor
tant, is warmly indorsed by fair-traders,
while free-traders assert that it msk's a long
forward stride toward th goal of nniversal
freedom in trade. Tbe corsenens of oimnon is
that, should Congreas adopt the suggestion
tsdc by Mr. Cleveland, the Crsc efiecs would
bo beneficial to a iare number of English in
dustries, though after a time an adjustment
would necessarily take plac which would
ineviably work to the detrimentcf some others.
On the whole, the recommendation set forth
are regarded as sound, t hooch one or two of
the newspaners profess to think otherwise. Th
St James Gazette speak of the aetion as a re
markably sudden and altogether surprising
move, and in support of its criticism of the
message, quote Lord Overstore' assertion thai
th commerce of England wonld receive it
first crushing blow when free trade should b
adopted in the United States. Competition
with free trade in America, the Gazette says,
was what Lord Overstoae eeemed most to dread
and hi fears were shared and are still enterj
tained by many of th leading financiers ant
merchants of the day.
The Mooring Post Bays: "The messag will
produce a profound sensation in Europ a well
as in America, aud will strengthen the free
traders' cause throughout th world."
Th Daily New says: "Seldom ha an Ameri
can President bad a more important or compre
hensive lesson to teach. The faet is that,
although President Cleveland make a pretensa
to shutting eyes to it, tbe policy of protection
has been reduced to a practical and theoretical
absurdity. Tbe stone now set rolling will cot
stop till the idea of protection is broken is
pieces."
The Telegraph asks: "I th President rnrm
that it is to the wool tariff alone that tha argu
ment applies? Is he certain that there are not
large numbers not. perhaps in the farming, buf
in the wage-earning Classes in America who losf
more by tbe enhanced prices of neceesariea of
life than they gain from an increase in wages
by the protection of the industries tn which they,
are employed? This is a question wbicb free
traders ask, and which, also American state'
men may hear addressed to them by their coun
trymen in a different tone.1
The Times says: "No messae on record is
more remarkable for a bold, outspoken dis
closure of a novel policy hitherto opposed or
ignored bv both political parties. It is still more
remarkable that Mr. Cleveland has the courage
to confront the aeried . phalanx of pro
tectionists on tbe eve of a contest
for the presidency. So far a England is con
cerned it is questionable, whatever tbe impulse
resulting from the removal of the burdens oa
American industry, whether America will no.
confront ns in formidable rivalry in both boms
and foreign markets. We have confidence, how
ever, in the laws by which, when trade i free,
every nation discovers its fittest work, and
turns its advantages to best account"

Rumor that Mr. hmlih Will Make a Fight

Washington, Dec C. Tb principal topic ot
conversation this morning among members oa

pointed to succeed Mr. Smith as journal clerk,
took the oath of oca this morning, and after a
consultation with his predecessor began at once
the discharge of bis duties. It is rumored that
Mr. Smith will make a fight for reinstatement,
and that a Michigan Democratic member will
offer a resolution providing for an inquiry into
the vague statements that have been made to the
effect that the change was tb result of a
promise by the Indiana Democrats to support
the Clerk of the House in bis candidacy for re
election if the office of journal elerk was given
to an Indiana man, ard that Don M. Dickinson
bad demanded Smi.. mova!.
When Mr. Clark, the Clerk of tbe House, was
spoken to on the subject this morning, h de
clared positively that Mr. Dickinson had not
communicated in any way with bim in regard
to the matter. Her-- itended to make the
change last session. J, but bad deferred

Indiana delegation ... been consulted upon th

been requested to furnish some information
concerning Mr. Robinson' record. Mr. Clark
denied in strongest term that ther bad been
any understanding between himself and the In
diana delegation relative to his candidacy for
