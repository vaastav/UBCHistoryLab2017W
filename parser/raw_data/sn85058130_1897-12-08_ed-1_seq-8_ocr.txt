ISUSTAINE THE VETO
Of tHe Lease to the Warm Springs
Property
MULVEYS GREAT DREAM
CATTJSTEB GIVES A UNIQUE INTERPRETATION
I TRETATON OF IT
Proposition From Mr Schenck of the
Sanitarium t Take the Warm
Springs LeaseReasons Given By
I Members For Their Votes On the
Veto
The large number of spectators who
filled the city council chamber last
evening to partake of the entertain
ment afforded by the discussion and
revelation relative to the Warm Springs
I lease and the mayors veto upon the I
j subject were well repaid for the time
sacrificed The lessees unburdened j I
j I their tale o woe a proposition from I
i I Proprietor Schenck of the sanitarium j
I I to lease the springs at a high rental
was received and the mayors veto was
sustained Contrary to expectation the
threat of the minority to retaliate upon
Mayor Glendinning by prodding him on
the charge of having grossly misused
I the contingent fund and refusing to
account for disbursements from it all
I because of his action in disapproving
i Barnes Byrnes new lease failed In
I stead a programme of explaining votes
against sustaining the veto during I
I which some harsh words against his
honor was adhered to The star fea I
tures of the entertaining programme
I I were a little bit disjointed but as a I
I crowning act in the comedy Council
i j i man Canisters effusion on Mulveys I
celebrated noonday dream brought
I I down the house and will pass into his
j i i tory as a unique interpretation of the
i I councilmans vision
The mayors veto as published in The I
I Herald recently was read and in the
same connection the recorder read a I
I communication from Barnes Byrnes
I
I calling attention to some alleged grave
errors in the mayors veto message rel I
I ative to the proposed amended lease I
I THE LESSEES INNING
Barnes Byrnes communication
I I stated that the mayor was altogether
in error regarding the receipts of the
Warm Springs property and criticized
the city for entering into a compact I
with a money lender referring to Ba
i cons sanitarium project to destroy
i their business This compact and the
i business depression crippled them so I
j j I severely that they were compelled to 1 I
appeal to the city for better terms The 1 j
communication closed with a plea to
not let the veto prevail or in that I
ever that an appraiser be appointed I
i as provided in the lease and take the I
I property off their hands Referred to i
I the committee on public grounds
A RIVAL WILL PAY MORE
Next came a communication from
Jeremiah Schenck who is one of the I I
chief persons in interest in the sani I
tarium to the effect that since he un
derstood Barnes Byrnes the lessees i
desired to be released or have a reduc I
tion in the rent he would make a prop
osition as follows He would take the
Warm Springs property as it now
stands for the nine years remaining j i
under the Barnes Byrnes lease pay j
ing 200 monthly in advance That the i
counci may not be annoyed with peti J i
tions for reduction of rent a clause I
may be put in the contract of lease j
that no request for a reduction of ren
tal shall be asked or granted during
the term specified
The Schenck communication was re
ferred to the committee on public
grounds and the city attorney asso
ciated
THE VETO CONSIDERED
Finally consideration of the execu
tives veto was commenced
Wiscomb wanted a weeks postpone
ment because he thought some of his
colleagues would be unable to weigh
the claims of Barnes Byrnes and
consider the veto on the merits while
having in mind the Schenck proposi
tion which he believed had been pre
sented to subserve some unworthy pur
pose
poseL Prohon concurred ih Wicombs
views yet he thought the proposition
from Mr Schenck worthy of serious
consideration
I Lloyd wanted one bridge crossed at I
a time and favored immediate action
on the veto
Callister expressed his surprise that
another weeks postponement was de
sired When the majority at the pre
vious session conceded postponement
till now it was with the implied prom
ise that the minority would be prepared
with figures to refute the mayors cal
culations Now he wanted them to
demonstrate what they wanted a weeks
time to undertake
The motion t postpone was lost only
Le Prohon Wiscomb and Newell vot
I ing in the affirmative
THE VETO SUSTAINED
The roil call vote on sustaining the j
mayors disapproval of the new lease
to Barnes Byrnes resulted as fol
lows I
Noes Le Prohon Mulvey and Wis
I comb
Ayes Allen Buckle Callister Dale
I Hayward Lloyd Morris Romney and
I Stewart
Excused from voting OMeara and
Newell
II Absent DIehl
As the vote was taken the opponents
I to the veto seized the opportunity to I
explain their positions
I In a vary incoherent manner Le Pro I
hon undertook to make some remarks
I The substance of his mixture of words I
was that Barnes Byrnes contentions
I were correct and that the mayor was I
maliciously incorrerct
Mulvey declared that the presenta
tion of the Schenck proposition con
vinced him that there was something
rotten in the veto The mayor he
said had solicited his vote for the
lease He had investigated the claims
of the lessees for reduced rental and
was convinced there was merit in them
and moreover the committees recom
mendation helped form his conviction I
He charged that the mayors action
was cowardly although he could not I
believe that his honor inspired the veto
and according to his belief the mayor
let out the job of writing vetoes I
MORE EXPLANATIONS
OMeara announced his intention of I
voting to not entertain the veto for
the reason that he believed the mayor
had no jurisdiction in the premises He
held that the executive had power only
to veto ordinances and resolutions call
ing for the expenditure of money The
counci he believed had sole author
ity in the matter of renting city prop
erty
OMearas contention was ruled out
of order and the only way he could get
his ideas in the record W3 by excus
ing himself from voting for the rea
sons stated
Newell refused to vote for the reasons
given by OMeara
Wiscombs reason was explained to
be that he favored no action that would
lead to the Sanitarium company hav
ing a monopoly on the sulphur bathing
privileges
Callister who had inadvertently vot
ed with the minority was permitted
to change his vote and in doing so
criticised the tactics of the minority
who had he asserted utterly failed to
demonstrate that the veto was not the
proper thing
SPRUNG A SURPRISE
A little later in the proceedings Cal
lister took the assemblage unawares I
and read an effusion that purported to
give a literal and accurate interpreta I
tion of Mulveys madetoorder I
di The author of the dissertation
me its reference to the dreamer but
OMearas amendment to refer to the
sewer committee of which Mulvey is a
member carried
Before the vote was taken Mulvey
J
said
saidMy
My friend Callister was one of the
councilmen I had reference to when I
tried to make you think I had dream
ed of that occurrence I will leave it
to the public to judge who is right
about this veto and as for my dream
I believe it was correct
THE DREAM EXPLAINED
The treatise for which Callister be
came sponsor is as follows
Whereas At midday one of the mem
bers of this honorable body like
Nebuchadnezzar of old dreamed dreams
wherewith his spirit was troubled and his
sleep broke from him and <
Whereas Like the aforesaid king said
members mind became clouded and he
was unable to give a clear account of his
dream or the interpretation thereof
and upon request said member was
granted one weeks time wherein to con
sult his dream book and the wise men of
the city for relief and
Whereas Said wise men etc having
failed to reveal unto him his dream
and its interpretation and the public
Iiress having invited the mayor and the
public generally to meet with us this
eveninir and hear the dream and its
startling revelations and
Whereas I becomes one of the duties <
of this council to save its members from
humiliation and t satisfy the demands
of the public ant knowing by the ex
perience of the past its ability to do al
most anything therefore this council
Resolves That the following is the
dream of the gentleman a it would have
been related by himself had it not been
for lapse of memory
MULVEYS DREAM
According to my usual custom after
my noonday repast I laid myself down I
on a couch to smoke a cigar and con
temDlate upon the news of the day
amour which was the rumor that the
maor was going to veto the Warm
Springs lease 1 was reciting over in my
mind what would be his reasons and
whilst thus musing I was carried away
in the spirit and found myself upon a
high mountain with a stranger by my
side As I looked upon him he said
City Father cast thy eyes eastward and
tell me what thou seest
I dimly see said I the city and
county building and two councilmen
entering the apartments of the mayor
Dark suspicion immediately arose in my
mind I imagined these men were two I
of the bitterest foes of the Warm Springs
lease and also the ones who had been
pro bin the mayor about his contingent
fund I
I thought I could discern their in
tentions They had come to enter into
a compact with the mayor whereby he I
was to veto the lease and sign the ap
propriation list and they were to say no
more about the contingent fund I
thought I could hear the mayor agreeing
with them the blood was rushing to my
head and as I was about to exclaim
something my companion said
City father awake from thy lethargy
and cast thins eyes eastward again I
I did as directed and this time the vision
was made clearer to me To my surprise
and delight I discover these two men
to be friends of the lease
Instead of entering the mayors apart
ments as I first thought they had entered
J
tered those of the city attorney Thay
had the mayor in one corner and were im
ploring of him to sign the lease but he
was unmoved by their entreaties At last
becoming exasperated they began to
threaten and said that they would ex
pose his contingent fund I saw the
mayors face glow with anger and heard
him exclaim something like this Lay
on MacDuff there are others who have
skeletons in their closets beside the
mayor At this the gentlemen departed
and the vision passed before my eyes 1
turned to my companion who said City
father again cast thine eyes eastward I
did as I was directed and the same build
ing appeared before inc I saw a person
enter the office of the city attorney
He addressed himself unto him whose
word is law and exclaimed I want you
to make Jim sign that lease you can do
it The man of law arose from his chair
coughed and exclaimed No not by a
blankety blank sight If you think you
have any strings on thIs mayor pull
them
The gentleman departed A change
came over my vision The air around the
building changed it became blue and
judging from the odor I thought the
Warm Springs had been transferred
there I saw three men retire from the
building I could hear mutterings oaths I
and threats to have 2 public barbecue
with his honor the mayor for th3 ox
As they drew near me tho air grew op
pressive and the sulphuric gas was so
strong that I began to gasp and with a
loud cry awoke and discovered that my
cigar was still burning and that I had
been lying on my back with my mouth
ajar
TWO I8ANEPATiE1TSI
DISTRESSING CASE OP MRS
VERA JULIA SIMS
She I Committed to the Insane Asy I
lum Jacob Sora a Miner Prom
Eureka Lost His Mind By Over
indulgence I Intoxicants
The lunacy commission consisting of
Drs Anderson and Wright and Deputy
Clerk Blair had two classes in mental
philosophy yesterday The more im
portant case concerned Mrs Vera Julia
Sims a young woman who has evident
ly had more than her share of illfor
tune The witnesses were Dr Witcher
Mrs Florence Schmolhurst and R L
Shannon and the evidence showed that
the patient was frequently irresponsible
for her actions When a little girl she
had an injury to her spine that pro
duced nervous disorders She marred
Robert D Sims before she was out of t
her teens but some time afterward
according to her own statements Mr
Sims deserted her The evidence show
ed also that Mrs Sims was a victim
of the morphine and cocaine curses
Financial and domestic troubles
coupled with the fact tnat sue could
not sleep nor rest without resorting to
the use of the stupefying drugs aggra
vated her case Only when endeavor
ing to abstain from the use of tIle
opiates does she become mentally un
balanced
MORE OF HER HISTORY
All through the proceedings Mrs
Sims showed a surprising degree of
intelligence and selfconsciousness She
admitted all the allegations but plead
ed to not be committed to the insane
asylum She wanted to reform her
habits and pathetically begged to bt
sent to friends at Helena Mont where
until about a year ago she held a po
sition as a trained nurse The unfor
tunate woman was once an inmate of
an asylum at Yankton N D and her
mother lives at Newbery Ore Minne
sota is her native state
After considering the matter in all
Its hearings the commission resolved
to commit Mrs Sims to the state insane
asylum where it is belIeved She will
be speedily cured of her mama and
be fully restored to health
ANOTHER INSANE PATIENT
The second subject to be examined by
the commission as to his sanity was
Jacob Hora a miner from Eureka who
hasbecome insane from an overindul
gence in alcoholic liquors He is the
man who recently made some violent
demonstrations at St Marys hospital
Hora was adjudged insane but his
commitment will not be ordered until
from the Juab county officers are heard

The commission this afternoon au

period within which they shall comply
with the provisions of the act of con

upon which hearing has just been had
the commission has decided upon causes
shown to extend such period two
years for the petitioning carriers
While the formal order and state

yet been prepared i is understood that
the extension will not be conditional
and that the commission has under
consideration the question of requiring
I quarterly or other periodical reports of

A HOT TELEGRAM
News Prom Omaha Concerning the
U P Transfer
Under the label Special the Trib
une yesterday printed a lot of rot from
Omaha anent the transfer of the Un
ion Pacific in which among other curi
ous things it was stated that it would
require possibly a year ere the change
would take place Inasmuch as a de
lay of this sort would mean a financial
loss on money already invested of 780
000 it is not thought the reorganization
committee will be very slow in get
ting acton on itself
The telegram was the amusement of
many railroad men in the city yester
day especially that portion relating to
the delay of a year andvilso a portion
which stated when thel transfer was
made the court WQuId ask questions
about officials appointea and maters
of that kind The court will do no
such thing I will see that the trans
fer was legally made and then its du
ties will cease I would have just as
much right to make inquiries concern
ing the brand of train oil used as to in
quire concerning officials
I As a heavy piece of news this spec
ial was a hummer and slfould be kept
standing at top of column next t
reading matter until something hap
pens
Little was learned locally concerning
the transfer of the property I was
stated at headquarters of the Short
Line that information had been receiv
ed to the effect that all the general
agents of the line had been notified to
hold themselves in readiness to come
to Omaha at a moments notice for
consultation with the new manage
ment The local agent at Butte has re
ceIved this notice and inasmuch as it
appeared to be a duplicate i is pre
sumed to be a copy of others sent out

had promised him the place But Jack
Donovan was selected and Cannon
went into seclusion Now after all
these years it would seem that Boman
has forgiven Arthur and is going to
try again Perhaps Pratt will stand by
him this time Perhaps
Matt Rhodes was led up on the car
pet a few days ago by Police Commis
sioner Kenyon Samuel wanted to
know why Matt pulled Essie Wat
kins Rhodes replied that Chief Pratt
used to do the same and then the con
versation lagged for lack of interest
ing subjects for discussion
LAKE IIONEVftE PUJECTI
WATER AND POWER COMPANY
TO ACQUIRE 215900 ACRES
Land Which It Will Reclaim By Ir
rigation Contract With the State
Soon to Be Signed Contest De
cided By the Land 1 u
The great Bonneville irrigation pro
ject is gradually assuming definite
form Judge Street representing the
Lake Bonneville Water Power com
pany appeared yesterday before the
state board of land commissioners to
complete the formalities preliminary to
the signing of the contract between
the state and the company for control
of the lands which the company ex
pects to reclaim and furnish water for
in Milford and Juab counties
The judge read a communication to
the board in which the company form
ally accepts the ruling of the board in
all the contests which have been de
cided against the Lake Bonneville
company He also filed formal waiver
of appeal in these cases so that there
could be no further question of the
status of the land involved in those
decisions The effect of this is to fix
the acreage controlled by the Lake
Bonneville company at a little over
215900 a reduction of 5636 acres from
the original application filed by the
company The judge read from the re
port of the interior department sugges
tions as to modifications to be made in
the showing of tjhe company and the
state board when the contract is
signed These suggestions will be
complied with in a formal letter to the
department from the state board which
will be forwarded with the copy of the
contract
WANTED THE CONTRACT SIGNED
After the presentation of his state
ment Judge Street asked the board to
sign the contract with the Lake Bon
neville company as drawn up by At
torney General Bishop The contract
will be examined by the board this
morning and the representatives of the
company will appear tomorrow after
noon when it is expected the contract
will be signed by the proper authori
ties thus ending the preliminary stages
of the undertaking The company will
be given a reasonable length of time in
I which to file the 8EOOOO bond required
by the board as a guaranty of the ful
fillment of the terms of the contract
As soon as the bond is filed and ac
cepted the contract will become opera
tive and the company will then be in
shape to proceed with the active con
struction work which will follow the
closing of the financial negotiations
which have been dependent upon the
signing of the state contract
A CONTEST DECISION
The board rendered a decision in the
contest for Draper land between Beck
and Sanders Originally the Sixty
seventh school district was also a
party to the contest because it claimed
four acres of land part of which was
on Becks land and part on the strip
in dispute It was agreed however
that the school district should retain its
land no matter who won in the hear
ing With this understanding the
board decided in Becks favor as to 117
acres and a fraction north of what is
known as the Terry ditch and in San
ders favor as to 37 acres and a frac
tion south of the ditch The decision
is subject to the filing of maps with
the board as required by law showing
that a survey has been made and de
fining the land in interest by metes and
bounds
HEART DISEASE
SOME PACTS REGARDING THE
SAPID INCREASE OF HEART
TROUBLES
rU
Do Not Be Alarmed But Look For
te Cause
Heart troubles at least among Amer
icans are certainly increasing and
while this may be largely due to the
excitement and worry of American
business life it is more often the re
sult of weak stomachs of poor diges
tion
Real organic heart disease is incur
able but not one case in a hundred of
heart trouble is organic
The close relation between heart
trouble and poor digestion is because
both organs are controlled by branches
of the same great nerves the Sympa
thetic and Pneumogastric
In another way also the heart is
affected by that form of Joor diges I
tion which causes gas and fermenta
tion from half digested food there is
a feeling of oppression and heaviness
in the chest caused by pressure cf
the distended stomach on the heart and
lungs interfering with their action
hence arises palpitation and short
breath
Poor digestion also poisons the blood
makes it thin and watery which irri
tates and weakens the heart
The most sensible treatment for heart
troubles is to improve the digestion and
to insure the prompt assimilation of
food
This can best be done by the regular
use after meals of some safe pleasant
and effective digestive preparation like
Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets which may
be found at most drug stores and which
contain valuable harmless digestive
elements in a pleasant convenient
form
formI is safe to say that the regular
persistent use of Stuarts Dyspepsia
Tablets at meal time will cure any form
of stomach trouble except cancer of
stomach
Full sized packages of the tablets
sold by druggists at 50 cents
