YET THEY MURMUR
GERMANS W THE EEIOHSTAG COM
PLAIN OF REPRISALS.
Von Bleberstein Contends that the Texas
1'erer icare Really Scared and was a
Genuine Ennsjcr to Their Native Cattle
American J iisuiv-ncp Companies on the
Fame Footing as iIo German Compan
ies Emperor William's Commemora
tive Habit ScJres Him In View of the
Empire's Anniversary.
Berlin. Dec. S. The minister for for
eign affairs, Marschall von Bleberstein
made a statement today in the reich
SZ3.S ori President Cleveland's recent
message to congress. He denied that
there -Eras any differential "treatment
in C-ermany of American cattle and in
surance companies.and urged the house
not to be insimidated toy reprisals.
The secretary of the treasury stated
that the federal states for the current
year might reckon upon 3000,000 marks
over the estimates in direct revenue.
He added that he also expected to show
an Increase of 31,000,000 marks compar
ed with, last year.
Herr Fritzen, a member of the center
party, asked "for a declaration upon the
part of the government regarding the
aJleged 'threatened reprisals against
Germany's trade contained in President
Cle veland's recent message to congress
In reply the minister for foreign affairs
said that the United States still treats
German sugar the same as In 1S94 in
spite of the fact that tve have the most
favored treatment It is, therefore,
surprising that President Cleveland
should reproach Germany with treating
American products differentially and
American insurance companies vexa
tijusly. This is quite unfounded. The
import of American cattle and beef was
prohibited because Texas fever broke
out in the consignment received here.
"It is our duty," be said, "to show
solicitude for the maintenance of the
condition of the German cattle, and this
duty can in no way be subordinated to
the politico-commercial Interests of
other countries.
INSURANCE COIPANIES
"Similarly there 5s no question of the
differential treatment of American in
surane companies. The regulations
are published 'by the Prussian minis
ter for the Interior and are applied
equally to the home and foreign com
panies. "Whether these regulations met
the objeot in view or not is a matter
f "lrly for the Prussian government to
determine and foreign states have not
the right of criticism. I
"We have always truly and loyally
fulfilled our treaty obligations to the
United States and -will continue to do
s-, but do not let us be intimidated !
by threats of reprisals or Induced to t
revoKe our measures. The German
rovernment Is always willing to dis
cuss politico-commercial questions Tvlth
the United States on a treaty basis, in
order to deal with them In a manner be
fitting our multifarious trade relations
w.th a great and friendly power. But,
v.- expect reciprocal treatment to the
fullest extent.
"The foreign office. In any further
handling of the question, -will combine
"dimness and moderation with the
flr.nness which corresponds with our
rhts and duty and to -which our In
t rrsts and -well founded rights enti
t' us."
C unt von Kardoff, the German silver
" ampion expressed satisfaction at the
r l ment of the minister for foreign
.ifilrs and urged the government to
c ?cr upon a strenuous campaign
n gainst socialism, declaring that the
ministry must, before all, show social
ism a united and decided front. The
house then adjourned.
Emperor William 'this evening receiv
ed the presidents of the reichstag and
expressed the hope that their .task?
during the present session would make
Batlsfaotory progress. His majesty
then announced that on January IS, the
anniversary of the foundation of the
emplre, he proposed to give a great fete
at the imperial palace, at which he hop
ed to "see both the present members of
the reichstag and those who belong to
that great epoch and "who are still
alive.
CLEANED OUT THE ITALIANS.
Rome, Dec 9. News was received
here today from General Bahatiori.the j
commander of .the Italian troops in
Abysinnla, announcing what appears
to bo a serious disaster to the Italian
f -ces opena'tlng against King Menelik.
He cabled that the king's navy, num
bfing about 20.000 men, surprised and
suToundd yesterday five companies
f Italian troops under Major Toselll
nt Ainbngrnli. Another body of Ital
ian troops, under the command of Gen
eral Aramondi advanced to the support
of Major Toselli, but they were stopped
by the enemy. A severe battle was i
subsequently fought but the result was
not made known here. The official
d.spaiehes say that the losses of the
Abyssinians were heavy but no news
was furnished concerning the fate of
T-iselll's command and nothing was
said about the losses of the Italians.
Later In the day. in the chamber of
deputies, the government was ques
tioned regarding the reported disaster
which the Italian troops suffered in
Abyssinia, and the matter led to warm
attacks upon tlie government's policy
in Africa.
Replying to a question as to the par
rtculars of the battle of Ambagall. the
m'nister of war. General Macnnl.read
the dispatch from General Baratiori,
r substance of which is given above,
ani added that the Italian positions
wre secure. lie admitted, however,
hat the Incident was a serious one, al
though entirely repairable.
Sicnor Anibrianl. the Socialist leader
amid interruption, made a violent
5D-ch in opposition to the policy fol
lowed by the government in Abyssinia
and the other Socialists alo denounced
the African policy of the government.

Electric Bitters is a medicine suited
for any season, but perhaps more gen
erally needed, when the languid ex
hausted feeling prevails, when the liver
' is torpid and sluggish and the need of
a tonic and alterative is felt. A prompt
use of this medicine has often averted
long and perhaps fatal bilious fevers.

IiKAl'II OF ISAIEXKY LASTRT.
A Grand, Good Irishman Passes Away to
IIW Long Jlonj.
Last Saturday at his home at Strong
City lion. Barney Lautry yielded his
spirit to the God that gave It surround-
ed by his family and friends.
Almost everybody along the different
main lines and branches of the Santa
Fe road to the city of Mexico knew
Mr. Lautry and to know the old man
was to entertain a higher opinion of
mankind. He has been for a great
or for ,the system and h5s iast great
contract was for tne work of the Mex
ican Central road.
A year ago he was the Democratic
candidate for state treasurer and ran
ahead of his tioket. He was not a pol
itician and he himself often said that
the Democrats nominated him wholly
and solely to give tone to the ticket.
He had more fun out of the campaign
than anybody and he used to go into
paroxysms of delight at seeing Dave
Overmeyer shake his wooly head. Mr.
V Li lilt, . JllH(. A 4.3 WJ AV.&V ..
Lantry himself made no speeches, but
usually Indulged In a little display of
sweet and catchy Blarney and rich
and racy humor, for a few minutes.
He was always regarded as the model
Irishman of Kansas. He had a great
big heart, was generous to a fault and
so far as the artifices and shams of
life were concerned he "was as Innocent
as a child. He lived in perpetual sun
shine and he truly grappled his friends
to his heart with hooks of steel. Am
ong his more intimate friends was Maj
or W. N. Ewing of this city whose heart
felt sad when he was informed of his
death. A few months ago one of the
Eagle force met him. His face was
more radient than ever and his heart
was lighter for he had just paid about
$15,000 for a home for his old mother in
Wisconsin and was returning from in
stalling her in it.
Mr. Lantry was one of the rich men
In Kansas, If not the richest. He owns
a farm at Strong-City that is surround
ed by 113 miles of stone fence and in
cludes a barn that cost $50,000 to build.
He had his own waterworks plant and
almost all the operations of the farm
was done by -machinery. He had Chi
namen for servants In his house and
they treated him like a king and loved
him like father. He owned the finest
cattle and horses and had bier blocks
of stock In many of the leading banks
of the state. Notwithstanding his
wealth he was a. very plain man and
many times for recreation he would
build the chimneys on his own buildings
He had no use for a man that was
not honest and industrious and had
less use for a man that was proud or
stuck up.
He was all that could be said of a
grand, good man.

AMERICAN PFDERATI0N IN SESSION
IN NEW YORK 0ITY.
Vice President aicBrlde Denounces the
Administration's Financial Course Ad
vocates Recognition of the Cubans
Criticises the National and State Con
stitution as Not lielnj-; Adapted to Con
serve the nights of Present-Day People
Agitator Svrinton Speaks Father
Ducey Represents the Pope.
New York, Dec. S-The fifteenth an
nual convention of the American Fed
eration of Labor began in Madison
Square garden today. Delegates were
present from all over the United States,
Canada and Great Britain.
Vice "President .McBride presided and
introduced J. W. Sullivan of Typogra
phical Union No. 6, iwhl delivered the
address of welcome. The report of the
president, secretary and treasurer were
read and referred.
Presidenit (McBride then read his an
nual address, occupying the floor fully
!half an hour.
"The greatest crime of the nineteenth
cfentury," he charged, "was that com
mitted by the present national adminis
tration In adding to the bonded indebt
edness of the country during a time of
peace." He charged that the people
had been deliberately and unmercifully
robbed in the interest of eastern bank
ers. The speaker had a warm woTd to say
for 'the Cuban patriots, and he urged
(the convention! to adopt resolutions pe
titioning' congress to at least recognize
ithem as belligerents.
In conclusion (the speaker turned his
attention to state constitutions. He
declared that the constitution of the
nation and the constitutions of many
of the states stood today as a monu
ment of the past greaitness and granfl
ness1 of our country.
TO PROTECT DEAD MEN.
He said Ithese constitutions"were made
for the purpose of protecting men and
methods norw dead, and -were not suit
ed for tflie changed industrial conditions
and Improved (mental status of tlhe .
present cfme. Hence the common peo- j
pie, if they "would better their conlli- i
rtibn, shoulod turn their attention to the '
cutting away of ithese constitutional j
barriers which Invalidate legaslotion '
enacted in the people's interest.
The chairman then introduced Labor .
Agitator John Swinton, who spoke in
part as follcws:
"The (federation of Labor is a power
in the United States. It is made up of
men who make all things and are uhe
natural owners thereof. I take much
pleasure in seeing the English repre
sentatives. I hope that this associa
tion will send delegates to all parts1 of
the earth as well as have foreign dele
gates present at our conventions. There
Is much Co learn from the British as
sembly. The union has done great
things, having- advanced uhe price of
lalbor and secured recognition in par
liament. "The largest thing- in organized labor
is he act -md fact of organization. It
(has grot"' from nothing-, being- In its
feorly Ala-yrr kicked and sneered. By
hard work it has won the right of exis
tence and you must maintain it under
penalty of death. Fifty years ago there
iwas 1 JStlei need of organization, for there
was w-ork for all. Times, however, have
changed. Another thing is the right to
strike against wrong; It used to be
more unlawful to strike than now.
Since that infamous Judge Woods
mounited the bench and the government
senlt the militia to Chicago, there is a
change.
IF THERE WERE MORE.
If there were no labor organizations
rwacres would be half, hours half as loner !
again, and capital would rule.
"How can you meet the questions of ,
the changed times? How can you com
bat the lalw? If you 'pass resolutions It
will ram rtlhem down your throat. There
tare many other questions, such as the
big- monopolies. They will have tn be
met by such a body as this."
FatSier Ducey was then imiroduced
and said:
"I am here because the popo wants
me to -be. if some of you do not. In
1S91 (an encyclical was issued by the
pope in negard to labor, and it is my
duty as a minister to be present where
sucsh matters arise. What Mr. Swin
ton has said is perfectly true."

MARVELOUS RVSXJT. TS.
From a ltter written by Rev. J. Gun
derman, of Diamondale. Mich, we are
permitted to make this extract: "I
have no hesitation in recommending
Dr. King's New Discovery, as the re
sults were almost marvelous in the
case of mv wife. While I was pastor of
the Baptist church at Rives Junction
she was brought down with Pneumonia
succeeding La Grippe. Terrible parox
ysms of coughing would last hours with

she could not survive them. A friend

WELL Is FKNCED IN.
Work Is Progresses Nicely and Contractor
AiMtin Feel Knconraced.
The works at prospect well are now
fenced in. But notwithstanding this
fact -work is progressing in good shape,
and at the present time the drill is
dancing a spasmodic jig in the neigh
borhood of 200 feet .beneath the sur
face of the ground.
For sometime the -work -was stopped
by the caving In of the crystallzed
gypsum, which appears to have lost its
tenacity to cling to the walls -when ex
posed to the air, and the entire well
had to be cased to shut this treacherous
gypsum from interfering with the work
Logs are kept of each five feet taken
from the ground and will be analyzed
by a chemist. Many claim that the
well has already shown that there are
valuable deposits beneath the city,
which If utilized -would support tho
state of Kansas.
Mr. Austin, the contractor, has had a
' serious time -with the -well, hut any
i person who visits the place will be as
sured that he thoroughly understands
his business. He thinks that the
worst is now over and that from this
on he will have clear sailing.
He has passed through two well de
fined subteranean rivers and has found
his worst trouble -with the quick sand.
He says he -will keep the well at the
6ame diameter as long as possible, as
by so doing- the findings are brought
up In sufficient quantities to be an
alyzed. The clay sent to the east is reported
to have stood the test of a chemical
analysis and will be burned In kiln at
East Liverpool, Ohio, and a thorough
report made.
The reason for fencing In the well
was to save the shrinkage in coal and
the disappearance of tools, besides pre
venting school children from getting
so close thatithey Tvere in danger of re
ceiving Injuries.

Stagnation in the London Market.
New York, Dec. 9. The dealings in
the railway list were relatively insig
nificant, beside the operations in the
industrials. Out of aggregates sales
for 'the day c-f a little over 370,000 shares.
Tobacco counted for 203,000 shares.
Speculation for the week began with
an active market and a lower tendency
to prices. Xafcurally enough, after the
exciting episode In Tobacco on Satur
day, a large crowd of traders centered
around the post in that stock this morn
ing and anxiously awaited the sound
of the gong. The first transaction re
corded -was 5.000 shares at from 63 to 66
per cent, as against 67& per cent, the
final sale of last week. The price soon
receded to 63 per cent and -then ranged
beaween 64 and 65 per cent, until the af
ternon, when an unmerciful "milking"
process carried the price to 72 per cent,
a rally of 9 percent from the lowest of
the day. The stock left off with a net
gain on 'the day of 4t per cent. The
preferred stock broke Sl per cent in
the early dealings, but subsequently
Improved with the common and closed
"with only a small fractional loss.
Heaviness was the characteristic of
the industrials at the opening, Chicago
Gas and Lea'cher preferred declining
sharply and sugar making an import
ant fractional gain, but was unable to
hold the advance. The market soon
evinced a tendency toward higher
prices and substantial gains followed
In Sugar, Leather preferred and Chica
go Gas. The gains in the railway list
were unimportant. Before the expira
tion of the first hour an effective drive
was made against the industrials and
together (with selling to realize profits,
accelerated a decline. Leather prefer
redd yielded 34 per cent, Sugar lJi per
cent and Chicago Gas about a point. In
the afternoon the 'tables were turned
and 'the bears were driven sharply to
cover, in some instances marking
prices up on each other in the high
priced industrials. As -was the case
earlier in the day, the improvement In
tho railways was slight. Leather pre
ferred iwas marked up 2 per cent. Su
gar 1 per cent. Consolidated Gas li
per cenit and Chicago Gas 1 per cent.
Late Jn the day ft "was learned that on
application for an Injunction tempor
arily restraining the carrying out of the
consolidation plan, made by a holder of
a 100 share certificate, and upon which
soma stock iwas sold, had been granted.
In the early rtradlng a decline of l?s
per cent occurred in Heading, which
was chiefly due to sales iby holders eith
er unable or unwilling to pay the 20 per
cent assessment Impending on all of the
Reading junior securities under the
proposed plan of reorganization. Event
ually a recovery was made of about
half of -the decline. It was believed thao
but for the erratic movements in tho
Industrials, the non-engagement of gold
and the (belief that none would be ship
ped on Saturday would have enabled
the railway list to make a better show
ing. The market closed active and
strong.
The railway bond market was quiet
and lower. The declines were confined,
however, to fractions. The sales were
$905,000.
Governments ruled higher on pur
chases of 545.000.
In state issues $3,500 Viginia centuries
were dealt In at a fractional advance.
Nerw York, Dec. 9. The Evening
Post's London cablegram says: Stag
nation characterised the stock markets
today. There are no signs at present
of a revival of speculation, the only
favorable indication being the prospect
of cheap money for a long period.
Americans were fiat, closing at the low
est. This was notably so of Reading on
apprehensions of a heavy assessment.
Paris and Berlin were quiet.
CONSOLIDATION GETS A CUKCK.

Xow York. Dec. 9. In the court of
common pleas today Judge Bischoff
granted a -temporary injunction re
straining the reorganization commit
tee of the Chicago Gas company and
the Central Trust company from pro
ceeding with the so-called consolidation
plan. The defendants are ordered to
show cause, at special -term of court, j
wny tne injunction snouia not oe maue
permanent. The plaintiff is "William R.
Whitney, the holder of a 100 share cer
