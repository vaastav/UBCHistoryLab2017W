The Message.
The really important portion of this document has
already been laid before our readers, having been re
ceived by telegraph.
The President proceeds at once to the consideration
Of the secession question, showing that the present con
dition of the country is just what might have been ex
pected to result from the constant agitation of the
slavery question at the North.
He refers to the action of South Carolina, affirms
that secession is revolution i3 opposed to the use of
force to coerce a State, but goes for collecting the duties
and holding on to the forts in the harbors of any beced-
incr States, the commanders of these forts acting on the
defensive.
The President goes into an elaborate argument
against the doctrine ot the right of secession, and yet
does not see that Congress is vested by the Constitution
with any power to make war upon or subdue a State.
lie recommends the adoption of certain amendments
to the Constitution of the United States, said amend
ments to be proposed by two-thirds of both Houses of
Congress, and ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths
of the several States. .
He proposes a certain explanatory amendment on
three points relating to slavery. An express consti
tutional recognition of the right of property in slaves
the duty of protecting the right in the common Terri
toriesan express declaration in reference to the deliv
ering up of fugitive Blaves,
The President refers at length to our foreign relations,
which are generally peaceful and satisfactory.
The President renews his recommendation for the ap
pointment by Congress of some certain day previous
to the 4th of March on each year of odd number for the
election of representatives throughout the United States.
The state of the Government finances requires a mod
ification of the Tariff for the purpose of increasing the
revenue. The President goes for specific duties in pre
ference to ad valorem duties.
"VVe publish to-day all that part of the Message bear
ing on secession. It is ably written, and will be care
fully weighed in this grave conjuncture of affairs.
How They TalU.
We have before us sundry papers from the North-
leading papers of the opposition party we mean the
triumphant Lincoln party, and they have pretty much
all resumed the bullying tone which distinguished them
duriDg the Presidential canvass,
That moderate Republican paper, the Philadelphia
TSTnrth American of Thursday the 5th inst., talks thus
about coercion, treason, and so forth :
The danger of permitting men to be drawn on in crime
Ktj n nnrmrent relaxation of law. and a seeming release
from the penalties incurred by such acts as have marked
the recent course ot outn uaronna, is now very grcai.
This growing belief in the possibility of seizing forts,
of closing rivers and harbors and of putting up the
framework of a southern confederacy is, in part, due to
the fact that the great majority of the people feared
false representation so much as to be unwilling to step
forward and declare what the inevitable consequences
would be. A partisan Executive is in power, who will
not do his duty, and partisan presses at the north prefer
to incite revolution, if they possibly can. Restrained
by delicacy, the leaders of the victorious party in the
elections are not willing to assume to speak for the gen
eral public at once, and so the state of affairs has an as
pect of relaxation and license of which the extremists at
the south are determined to make the most. It is new
our duty to arrest this easy sliding into trouble, even at
the risk ot beincr falsely represented. It is our duty to
There are times in the history of mankind when the
boldest holds his breath for a time, when the national
breathing may be said to stop in listening axten
tion, and the ' national pulse to throb with such solemn
emotion that its very beatiDgs may be counted.
This is one of those times, if ever there was one. It
is a time for solemn thought, for resolute action. It is
not a time for wrangling or recriminations. Least of
all should such recriminations be indulged by members
of the same community men engaged in one cause
identiGed in interest, who must sink or swim together.
How do we stand? How do the North and
the South stand towards each other in Congress ? How
do Northern and Southern men meet each other in the
common Territories ? What is the tone of the press ot
the diSerent sections ? What of the churches3 ? What
of theTtract societies ? What of anything? Can we
disguise the dangers of the position ?
The fight is openly begun already in Congress. Hule,
of New Hampshire, has opened tho ball in the Senate,
and IvcrsoQ, of Georgia, Urown of Mississippi, and
others have responded defiantly.
Divine Providence can avert disunion, and no less
1 T f 1 J il. ,f " 1 .. I. .Ul.Anf ft
power can ao so. i-Ciuni u tin u jiaiuu, wiuiuui a
miracle interposes to prevent it, this Union will inevita
bly be dissolved. The amendments to the Constitution
suggested by the President will never be made, nor
would they be in time to do anything, even if made.
We fear that the die is cast. Dissolution is inevitable.
The President's Message is mxlerate enough in its
way, but if its policy be carried out or attempted to be
carried out, it must result in collision. The collection
of the Revenue cf the- United States from States no
longer membt rs of the confederacy, will be resented as
an attempt to levy tribute. In dt-precating coercion,
yet proposing to collect tribute, the President makes
rather inconsistent recommendations. So in regard to
the federal property, the title to it as pioperty is cer
tainly in the federal go .rnment, and this will not be
denied, but tie holding of foits by the General Govern
ment, within the territories of seceded States will cer
tainly be resisted.
With the present spirit abroad in Congress among
the people the churches the presses the territories
everywhere, there can be slight hope of a peaceable ad
justment. Is North Carolina to cry peace, peace, when
she sees there is no peace ? Shall she not get ready for
any emergency ? Shall she not see not only how she
stands at home, but how she stands towards her sister
States ? Shall she not call her people together in Con
vention ? Shall she not prepare to risist aggression, if
aggression should come ? Surely, we thir k that she
should adopt all reasonable precautions, for the lime has
come, or will soon have come.

For the first time we learn that the people of the
North own the soil of the South that they bought it
naid for it or have defended it. The North and the
South have alike bought the territories acquired by
purchase, while the North has appropriated to herself
the exclusive benefit of the greater portion of such.

and those of our wives and our children.

in view of the recent election, and the sentiment there
in indicated of hostility to their interests, have been
prompted to the protection of their rights thu3 imperil

Conventions ot their States respectively, to determine
what course daty and their interests demand they should
take.
, Be it therefore Resolved by the citizens of Meckelen
burgh County :
1st. That we do hereby raise our voices in solemn
protestation against the sentiment which has produced
the crisis in which our beloved country and its institu
tions are involved by the recent election.
That in view ot the toregoing considerations, it is
in a State as in a territory ; the same jurisdiction in
this respect over South Carolina as over Utah.
The New York Tribune is, as usual, half rational and
more than half insulting. It says, let the Southern
States go, but let them take care how they go. The
Tribune, as the flunkey of the new administration is
really more arrogant and insulting than the most open
advocates of coercion.
A gentlemen who ha3 just been North tells us that
there is no realizing sense there among the people, of the
actual state of feeling at the South. All is looked upon
as mere bravado.

Tlie Onslow Fair.
Messrs. Editors : The secorid annual Fair of the
Ooslow County Agricultural Society, commenced on
Thursday, Nov. 22d. 1860. Thinking that perhaps you
would like to hear from the Fair, and feeling some pride
in the nrocress of mv native Couatv, I have drawn off
some briet remarks which are at your disposal if you
car give them a place in your columns.
Thursday. This day there was a grand parade
stock, after which there were trotting races. " Scrapps,'
(Dudley s horse,) received the first premium for trotting
" Prince," (Nixon s horse,) the second. 1 could not
learn who was the successful candidate for the third
premium. During the afternoon there were mule and
poney races, and the iun grew " last and furious " as is
always the case with this sort ot races
I went through " Floral II all " and " Farmer'i
Hall. JNow the exhibiton in " .b anner s i all was
in many rt-spects highly creditable, but as usual the
lathes bore off the palm. " Floral Hall " was decidedly
the most attractive locality, as might have been expect
ed. And this not only because of the beauty ot the
fair exhibitors, but trom the intrinsic excellence and
good taste of the articles exhibited
At night there was a grand party under the manage
ment of Drs. Ed. Ward, R. Ward, and Duffy, and
Messrs. Southerland, Gornto and Venters. Everything
passed off most harmoniously and pleasantly, all being
kept alive by the dulcet strains ot the inevitable aud
" irrepressible " Frank Johnson's band
Friday was so rainy and disagrcable that but few at
tended the Fair Ground, but in lieu thereof the Mar
shalls had the music up to the Academy, and so the
young tolks danced the hours away most pleasantly.
Iu the alternoon ol Friday, the " Onslow Cavalry
paraded, and it struck me that they manoeuvred very
well tor the practice they have had. Ihe Duplin Kin-
men were also on the ground, aud showed to much ad
vantage. Like the Onslow Cavalry, they parade and
drill remarkably well tor a Company but recently or
ganized
On Friday evening the bail was kept up, and dancing
was the order of the night. It is barely possible that
there were some incipieut flirtations commenced there
that may ripen into warmer feelings at some future day.
Deponent saith not. He is not at the confessional.
Saturday was a beautiful day, and the exercises ol
the Fair were resumed. At about 12 o'clock Mai.
Pearsall, of Duplin, delivered an Agricultural Ad
dress, setting forth in forcible language, not merely the
advantage, but the indispensable necessity for keeping
up our Fairs. He showed how this could be done, and
urged upon his hearers to use the means at their dispo
sal for this purpose.
1 rusting that Major Pearsall s advice may be act
ed upon, aud that each coming Fair may be an im
provement upon the one which preceded it, I remain
lours, etc., I3ETA.

Portland, Dec. 6. The fbliowiupr are the latest ad
vices received by the Canadian :
England. the arrangement made bv the Bank of
England lor an exchange ol two millions of gold for a
like amount of silver from the Bank of France, caused
an improvement in the money market, and the funds be
came buoyant. The London Times hopes the arrange
ment will terminate the prevailing uncertainties of the
money market, and lead to an early reduction ot the
bank rate of discount.
The London Daily News says opinions are generally
in favor of the measure, but cautions the public ot be
ing too sanguine, and shows that as a drain is going on
from both countries, this relief may be purchased at the
ultimate-cost of an increased future difficulty.
The London Herald's city article also regards the
measure as only palliative. There were no gold with
drawals from the bank on the 21st. In the discount
market there was a tendency to greater ease. Good
bills were taken at a veduction from the bank minimum.
The demand at the bank was moderate.
