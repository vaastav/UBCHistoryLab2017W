PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S FIRST MESSAGE
A~r the War Department must be made solely
' : ' d 'regard to the- good of the servlce and to the
tl ' arit , and merit of the man himself. No pressure.
iticsl social or personal, of any kind will be
p0 " it rd ;o exercise the least effect in any ques-
P* r ' of promotion or detail; and if there Is reason
Iio " ]ieve , that such pressure is exercised at the in
lo. at j or of the oiScer concerned, it will be held to
[t , e against him. In our army we cannot afford
01 have rewards or duties distributed save on the
10 ale jrround that Those -who by their own merits
** ,titled to the rewards get them, and that
*iose who arc Peculiarly fit to do the duties are
chosen to perform them.
Ever}' effort should be made to bring- the army to
• ronstantly increasing state of efficiency. When
* aetua! service no work save that directly in the
C-_(C -_( of such sen-ice should be required. The paper
''or* in the army, as in the navy, should be greatly
0PP (j. What is needed is proved power of cor
ned *nd capacity to work well in the field. Con
cast <* re fs necessary to prevent dry rot in the
Importation and commissary departments.
MANOEUVRES IN MASS.
* (jurErmy la so small and so much scattered that
jtrery difficult to give the higher officers (as well
*JJK ltwr.r officers and the enlisted men* a chance
3 practise manoeuvres in mass and on a compara
bly large scale. In time of need no amount of
ggSlCaal excellence -would avail against the
paralysis which would follow inability to work as a
coherent whole, under skilful and daring leader
ship. The Congress should provide means whereby
•: will be possible to have field exercise by at least
i aiviEicn of regulars, and, if possible, also a divis
ion of National Guardsmen, once a year. These
exercises might take the form of field manoeuvres;
■C. If on the Gulf Coast or the Pacific or Atlantic
seaboard, or in the region of the Great Lakes, the
army corps when assembled could be marched from
some inland point to some point on the water, there
embarked, disembarked after a couple of days'
Journey at some other point, and again marched
inland. Only by actual handling and providing for
nen in masses while they are marching, camping,
embarking find disembarking- -will it be possible to
train the officers to perform their duties well
gr.is smoothly.
A great debt Is owing- from the public to the men
cf th* army and navy. They should be so treated
as to enable them to reach the highest point of
efficiency, so that they may be able to respond in
stantly to any demand made upon, them to sustain
• the interests of the nation and the honor of the
flap. The individual American enlisted man is
probably on the -whole a more formidable lighting
nan than the regular of any other army. Every
consideration should be shown him, and in return
the highest standard of usefulness should be ex
acted from him. It Is well worth -while for the
Congress to consider whether the pay of enlisted
men upon seoond and subsequent enlistments
should rot be increased to correspond with the in
creased value of the veteran soldier.
Much good has already come from the act re
organizing 1 the army, passed early In. the present
year. The three prims reforms, all of them of
lltarally inestimable value, are, first, the substitu
tion of four year details from the. line for perma
nent appointments In the so-called staff divisions;
second, the establishment of a corps of artillery
with a chief at the head: third, the establishment
of a maximum and minimum limit for the army.
It -would be difficult to overestimate the improve
ment in the efficiency of our army which these
three reforms are making, and have in part already
effected.
The reorganization provided for by the, act has
been substantially accomplished. The improved
conditions in the Philippines have enabled the War
Department materially to reduce the military
charge upon our revenue and to arrange the num
ber of soldiers so as to bring this number much
rearer to the minimum than to the maximum limit
established by law. There is. however, need of
supplementary legislation. Thorough military edu
cation must be provided, and in addition to the
regulars the advantages of this education should
be given to the officers of the National Guard and
others in civil life who desire Intelligently to fit
themselves for possible military duty. The officers
should be given the chance to perfect themselves
by study in the higher branches of this art. At
West Point the education should be of the kind
most apt to turn out men who are good in actual
field service; too much etrees should not be laid
a mathematics, nor ehould proficiency therein be
Me to establish the right of entry to a corps
mite. The typical American officer of the best
Bad need not be a rood mathematician: bnt he
must be able to master himself, to control others
asd to show boldness and fertility of resource in
every emergency.
MILITIA AND VETERANS.
Action should be taken in reference to the militia
«nd to the raising of volunteer forces. Our militia
law is obsolete and ■worthless. The organization
and armament of the National Guard of the several
States, which are treated as militia in the appro
priations by the Congress, should be made identical
Kith those provided for the regular forces. The
obligations and duties of the guard in time of war
should be carefully defined, and a system estab
lished by law under which the method of procedure
of raising volunteer forces should be prescribed in
advance. It is utterly Impossible in the excitement
and haste of impending war to do this satis
factorily If the arrangements have not been made
lons beforehand. Provision should be made for
utilizing in the first volunteer organizations called
Ml the training of those citizens -who have already
had experience under arms, and especially for the
selection la advance of the officers of any force
■which may be raised: for careful selection of the
toai necessary is impossible after the outbreak
of war.
That the armr is not at all a m«>ro instrument
<£ destruction has been shown during the last three
yezrs. In the Philippines. Cuba and Porto Rico
it has proved itfcelf a great constructive force, a
aost potent implement for the upbuilding of &
Peaceful civilization.
Xo other citizens deserve s>o wHI of the republic
•s the vett-ranE. the «urvivor= of those who saved
the T*r.icm. They did the one deed which if !<*ft
todosc- would have meant that all <»lse in our
&*tory w-.t for nothing. But for their steadfast
prowess in the greatest crisis of our history, all
rcr annals wnuid be meaningless, and our great
txperlment ir. popular freedom and self-government
& flooay failure. Moreover, they not only left us
* waited nation, but they left us also as a heritage
ft* cemory of the mighty deo3s by which the
o^ion was kept united. We are now Indeed one
astioc, one in fact ac well as in name: we are
in our devotion to the flag which is the
**■ of national greatness and unity; and the
eomrieteneßß of our union enables us all, in
T part of the country, to glory in the valor
* a *B ailkc by the eons of the North and the sons
c-'thec -'the South in the times that tried men's souls.
men who in the last three years have done
10 *eH in the East and the West Indies and on the
— tiling of Asia have- shown that this remem
fcranc* is not lost. In any serious crisis the United
Sutes nuj rt rply for the great mass of its lighting
snsn upon the volunteer soldiery who do not make a
Permtnent profession of the military career; and
■"'beriever eu"h a crisis arises the deathless memo
rt?!l of the Civil War will sdve to Americans the
llft <* lofty purpose which comes to those whose
-athers have stood valiantly in the forefront of the
battle.
CIVIL SERVICE.
Tbe merit system of making appointments is in
't* esser.ee as democratic and American as the
waifflon school system itself. It Pimply means that
& clerical and other positions where the duties
*!"• entirely non-political all applicants should have
a fair field and no favor, each standing on his
ffi wits as he 1c able to show them by practical
test. Written competitive examinations offer the
°niy available means in many cases for applying
*!« system. In other capes, as where laborers are
<mploy*d, a system of registration undoubtedly can
** »i~.fcly extended. There are. of course, places
►here the written competitive examination cannot
•* applied, and others where it offers by no means
*0 ideal solution, but where under existing political
Seditions it Is, though an imperfect means, yet
*c best present means of getting satisfactory
Wherever the conditions have permitted the ap-
P&eatlon of the merit system In its fullest and
■Meet sense tie gain to the government has been
•ttnior.v,. The navy yards and postal service Illue
&M« probably better than any other branches of the
Sovf-mmeni the great gain in economy, efficiency
*nfl honesty due to the enforcement of this prin
«He. .
I recommend the passage of a law which will
***«-r,<l <;,,. classified service to the District of
**"***«ibia. or will at least enable the President thua
to extend it. In my judgment all laws providing
for the temporary employment of clerks should
hereafter contain a provision that they be selected
under the Civil Service law.
It Is important to have this system obtain at
home, but it Is even more Important to have it
applied rigidly In our insular possessions. Not an
office should be filled in the Philippines or Porto
Rico with any regard to the man's eartisan affilia
tions or services, with any regard to the political.
social, or personal influence which he may have at
his command; In short, heed should be paid to
absolutely nothing save the man's own character
and capacity and the needs of the service.
The administration of these islands should be as
wholly fr^e from the suspicion of partisan politics
as the administration of the army and navy. All
ihat we ask from, the public servant in the Philip
pines or Porto Rico is that he reflect honor on his
country by the way in which he makes that coun
try's rule a benefit to the peoples who have come
under it. This is all that we should ask, and we
cai not afford to be content with less.
The merit system is simply one method of secur
ing honest and efficient administration of the gov
ernment, and in the long: run the sole justification
of any type of government lies in its proving itself
both honest and efficient.
The consular service is now urbanized under the
provisions of a law passed in is.v>. which is entirely
inadequate to existing conditions. The Interest
shown by so many commercial bodies throughout
the country in the reorganization of the service is
heartily commended to your attention. Several
bills providing for a new consular service* have in
recent yean been submitted to the Congress. They
are based upon the just principle that appointments
to the service should be made only after a prac
tical test of the applicant's titness. that promotions
should be governed by trustworthiness, adaptability
and zeal in the performance of duty, and that the
tenure of office should bo unaffected by partisan
considerations.
The guardianship and fostering of our rapidly
expanding foreign commerce, the protection of
American citizens resorting to foreign countries in
lawful pursuit ot their affairs, and thp maintenance
of the dignity of the nation abroad, combine to
make it essential that our consuls should be men of
character, knowledge and enterprise. It is true
that the service is now in the main efficient, but a
standard of excellence cannot be permanently main
tained until the principles sot forth in the bills
heretofore submitted to the Congress on this sub
ject are enacted into law.
THE INDIAN.
In my judgment the time has arrived when we
should definitely make up our minds to recognize
the Indian as an individual and not as a member
of a tribe. The General Allotment act is a mighty
pulverizing engine to break up the tribal mass. It
acts directly upon the family and the individual.
Under Its provisions some slxtv thousand Indians
have already become citizens of the United States.
"We should now break up the tribal funds, doing for
them what allotment does for the tribal lands; that
i?. they should be divided into individual holdings.
There will be a transition period during which the
funds will In many cases hay* to be held in trust.
This is the case also with the lands. A atop should
be put upon the indiscriminate permission to
Indians to lease their allotments. The effort should
be steadily to make the. Indian work Ilk© any other
man on his own ground. The marriage laws of the
Indians should be made the same as those of the
whites.
In the eohools the education should be elementary
and largely industrial. The need of higher educa
tion among the Indians is very, very limited. On
the reservations care should be taken to try to
suit the teaching to the needs of the particular
Indian. There is no us>e in attempting to induce
agriculture In a country suited only for cattle rais
ing where the Indian should be made a stock
grower. The ration system, which is merely the
corral and the reservation system, is highly detri
mental to the Indians. It promotes beggary, per
petuates pauperism and stifles industry. It is an
effectual barrier to progress. It must continue to
a greater or less degree as long as tribes are. herded
on reservations and have everything in common.
The Indian should be treated as an individual— like
the white' man. During the change o: treatment
inevitable hardships will occur; every effort should
be made to minimize, these hardships: hut we should
not because of them heßitale to make the change.
There should be a continuous reduction In the num
ber of agencies.
In deaJins with the aboriginal races few thir.es
are more important than to preserve them from
the terrible physical and moral degradation, result
ing from the liquor traffic. "We are doing all we
can to pave our own Indian tribes from this evil.
Wherever by international agreement this same
end can be attained as regards races where we do
not possess exclusive control, every effort should
be made to bring it about.
EXPOSITIONS.
I bespeak the most cnrdlal support from the Con
gress and the people for the 6t. Louis Exposition
to Commemorate the One Hundredth Anniversary
of the Louisiana Purchase. This purchase was the
greatest instance of expansion in our history. It
definitely decided that we were to become a great
continental republic, by far the foremost power in
the Western Hemisphere. It is one of three or four
great landmarks in our history— the great turning
points in out development. It is eminently fitting
that all our people should join with heartiest good
will in commemorating it. and the. citizens of St.
Louis, of Missouri, of all the adiacent region, are j
entitled to every aid in making the celebration a ,
noteworthy event in our annals. We earnestly hope i
that foreign nations will appreciate the deep in
terest our country takes in this exposition, and our
view of its Importance from every standpoint, and
that they will participate in securing its success, j
The national government should be represented by j
a full and complete set of exhibits.
The people of Charleston, with great energy and !
civic spirit, are carrying on an exposition which i
will continue throughout most of the present session j
of the Congress. I heartily commend this exposition j
♦r> the goodwill of the people. It deserves all the i
encouragement that can ho. given it. The managers |
of the Charleston Exposition have requested, the
Cabinet officers to place thereat the> government ex
hibits which have been at Buffalo, promising to pay j
the necessary expenses. I have taken the respensi- I
■bllity of directing that this be done, for I feel that it j
is due to Charleston to help her in her praiseworthy
effort. In my opinion the management should not
be required to pay all these expenses. I earnestly
recommend that the Congress appropriate at once
the small sum necessary for this purpose.
The Pan-American Kxposition at Buffalo has |
iust closed. Both from the Industrial and the
artistic standpoint thie exposition has been in a
high degree creditable and useful, not merely to
Buffalo, but to the United States. The terrible
tragedy of the President's assassination interfered j
materially with its being a financial success. The
exposition was peculiarly in harmony with the
trend of our public policy, because it represented an
effort to bring into closer touch all the peoples of
the Western Hemisphere, and give them an in
creasing sense of unity. Such an effort was a
genuine service to the entire American public.
The advancement of the highest interest of na- |
tional science and learning and the custody of
obiects of art and of the valuable results of scien
tific expeditions conducted by the United States
have been committed to the Smithsonian Institu
tion In furtherance of its declared purpose- for the
••increase and diffusion of knowledge among men"
the Congress has from time to time given it other
important functions. Such trusts have been cxc- I
cured *V the institution with notab.e fidelity. There
should "be no halt in the work of the institution, in
accordance with the plans which its secretary has
presented for the preservation oi the vanishing
races of 'great North American animals in the
National Zoological Park. The urgent needs of the
National Museum are recommended to the favora
ble consideration of the Congress.
PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
perhaps the most characteristic educational move- I
ment of the last fifty years is that which has |
created the modern public library and developed it
into broad and active service. There are now over ;
five thousand public libraries in the United States. ]
the product of this period. In addition to accumu- |
lating material, they are also striving by organiza
tlon by Improvement in method and by co-opera
tion' to give greater efficiency to the material they
hold to make It more widely useful, and by avold
ar.c* of unnecessary duplication In process to re
duce the cost of its administration.
In these effort! they naturally look for assistance
to the Federal library, which, though still the
Library of Coiifc-reHS. and so entitled, is the one Ds>
NEW- YORK DAILY TRIBUNE. WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER *. ISWI.
tional library of the United States. Already the
largest single collection of books on the Western
Hemisphere, and certain to increase more rapidly
than any other through purchase, exchange and
the operation of the Copyright law. this library has
a unique opportunity to render to the libraries of
this country— to American scholarship — service of
the highest importance. It is housed in a building
which is the largest and most magnificent yet
erected for library uses. Resources are now being
provided which will develop the collection properly,
equip it with the apparatus and service necessary
to its effective use. render its bibliographic work
widely available, and enable it to become not mere
ly a o-ntre of ri search, hut the chief factor in great
co-operative efforts for the diffusion of knowledge
and the advancement of learning.
CENSUS OFFICE.
For the sake of gix.d administration, sound
economy and the advancement of science, the
Census Office as now constituted should be made a
permanent government bureau. This would insure
better, cheaper and more satisfactory work, in the
Interest not only of our business but of statistic,
economic and social science.
POSTAL SERVICE.
The remarkable growth of the postal service is
shown in the fact that its revenues have doubled
and its expenditures have nearly doubled within
twelve years. Its progressive development compels
constantly increasing outlay, but in this period of
business energy and prosperity its receipts grow so
much faster than Its expenses that the annual
deficit has been steadily reduced from $11,411,779 In
1537 to $3,1*23,727 ln 1901. Among recent postal ad
vances the success of tural free delivery wherever
established has been so marked and actual experi
ence has m;ide its benefits, so plain that the de
mand for its extension is general and urgent.
It is just that the great agricultural population
should share in the improvement of the service.
The number of rural routes now in operation is
6,009, practically all established within three years,
and there aro 6.000 applications awaiting action. It
is expected that the number in operation at the
close of the current fiscal year will reach 5.600. The
mail will then be daily carried to the doors of
5.700,000 of our people who have heretofore been
dependent upon distant offices, and one-third of all
that portion of the country which is adapted to it
will be covered by this kind of service.
The full measure of postal progress which might
be realized has long been hampered and obstructed
by the heavy burden imposed on the government
through the intrenched and well understood abuses
which have grown up in connection with second
class mail matter. The extent of this burden ap
pears when it is stated that while the second class
matter makes nearly three-fifths of the weight of
all the mail, it paid for the last fiscal year only
$4,204,445 of the aggregate postal revenue of $111,
€31,193. If the pound rate of postage, which pro
duces the large lO6S thus entailed, and which was
fixed by the Congress with the purpose of en
couraging the dissemination of public information.
were limited to the legitimate newspapers and
periodicals actually contemplated by the law, no
just exception could be taken. That expense would
be the reropnized and accepted cost of a liberal
public policy deliberately adopted for a justifiable
end. But much of the matter which enjoys the
privilege rate is wholly outside of the intent 'if the
law, and has secured admission only through an
evasion of its requirements or through lax con
struction. The proportion of such wrongly in
cluded maUer is estimated by the postal expert! 10
be one-half of the whole volume of second class
mail. If it he only one-third or one-quarter, the
magnitude of the burden is apparent. The Post
office Department has now undertak.'-n to remove
thft abuses so far as is possible by a stricter ap
plication of tha law, and it should be sustained in
its effort.
CHINA
Owing to the rapid growth of our power and our
interests on the Pacific, whatever happens in China
must be of the keenest national concern to us.
The general terms of the settlement of the ques
tions growing out of the anti-foreign uprisings in
China of 1900, having been formulated in a Joint
note addressed to China by th>> representatives of
the injured powers in December last, were prompt
ly accepted by the Chinese Government. After
protracted conferences the plenipotentiaries of tho
several powers were able to sign a final protocol
with the Chinese plenipotentiaries on September 7
last, setting forth the measures taken by China In
compliance with the demands of the Joint not",
and expressing their satisfaction therewith. It
will be laid before the Congress, with a report of
the plenipotentiary on behalf of the United States.
William WoodviUe Rockhill. to whom high praise
is due for the tact, good Judgment and energy he
has displayed in performing an exceptionally diffi
cult and delicate task.
The agreement reached disposes in a manner
satisfactory to th* powers of the various grounds
of complaint, and will contribute materially to
better future relations between China and the pow
ers. Reparation has been made by China for the
murder of foreigners during the uprising and pun
ishment has been inflicted on the officials, however
high in rank, recognized as responsible for or hav
ing participated In the outbreak. Official exami
nations have been forbidden for a period of five
years in all cities in which foreigners have been
murdered or cruelly treated, and edicts have been
Issued making all officials directly responsible for
the future safety of foreigners and for the sup
pression of violence against them.
Provisions have been made for insuring the future
safety of the foreign representatives in Peking by
setting aside for their exclusive use a quarter of
the city which the powers can make defensible and
in which they can, if necessary, maintain perma
nent military guards: by dismantling the military
works between the capital and the sea. and by
allowing the temporary maintenance of foreign
military posts along this line. An edict has been
Issued by the Emperor of China prohibiting for two
years the importation of arms and ammunition
Into China. China has agreed to pay adequate In
demnities to the States, societies and Individuals
for the losses sustained by them, and for the ex
penses of the military expeditions sent by the vari
ous powers to protect life and restore order.
Under the provisions of the Joint note of Decem
ber, 1900. China has agreed to revise the treaties
of commerce and navigation and to take such other
steps for the purpose of facilitating foreign trade
as the foreign powers may decide to be needed.
The Chinese Government lias agreed to partici
pate financially in the, work of bettering the water
approaches to Shanghai and to Tlen-Tsln. the
centres of foreign trade in Central and Northern
China, and an international conservancy board,
in which the Chinese Government is largely rep
resented, has been provided for the Improvement |
of the Shanghai Kiver and the control of its navi- I
gation. In the same line of commercial advantages ;
a revision of the present tariff on imports has j
been assented to for the purpose of substituting j
specific for ad valorem duties, and an expert has !
been sent abroad on the part of the United States j
to assist in this work. A list of articles to re- ;
main free of duty, including flour, cereals and rice, j
gold and silver coin and bullion, has also been ,
agreed upon In the settlement.
During these troubles our government has un- :
swervingly advocated moderation, and has ma- i
terially aided in bringing about an adjustment
which tends to enhance the welfare of China and
to lead to a more beneficial intercourse between
the. empire and the modern world, while in the ;
critical period of revolt and massacre we did our j
full share In safeguarding life and property, re- j
storing order and vindicating the national Interest ;
and honor. It behooves us to continue in these j
paths, doing what lies In our power to foster feel- j
ings of goodwill, and leaving no effort untried to
work out the great policy of full and fair inter
course between China and the nations, on a foot- |
ing of equal rights and advantages to all. We ad- j
vocate the "open door" with all that it implies, !
not merely the procurement of enlarged commer- j
cial opportunities on the coasts, but access to the j
interior by the waterways with which China has ,
been so extraordinarily favored. Only by bringing
the people of China into peaceful and friendly j
community of trade with all the peoples of the ,
earth can the work now auspiciously begun be car
ried to fruition. In the attainment of this purpose
we necessarily claim parity of treatment, under the ,
conventions, throughout the empire for our trade .
and our citizens with those of all other powers.
MEXICO.
We view with lively Interest and keen hopes or ,
beneficial results the proceedings of the Pan- :
American Congress, convoked at the invitation of
Mexico, and now sitting at th. Mexican capital.
The delegates of the United States are under the
most liberal instructions to co-operate with their
colleagues in. all matters promising advantage to
the gTeat family of American Commonwealths, as
well in their relations among themselves as in their
domestic advancement and in their intercourse with
the world at large.
My predecessor communicated to the Congress
the fact that the Weil nw\ La Abra awards against
Mexico have been adjudged by the highest courts
of our country to have been obtained through
fraud and perjury on the part of the claimants, and
that in accordance with th<- acts of the Congress
the money remaining in the hands of the Secretary
of Stale on these awards has been returned to
Mexico, a considerable portion of the money re
ft Ived from Mexico on these awards had been
paid by this t<> the claimants before
the decision of the courts w.is rendered. My Judg
ment is that the Congress should return to Mexico
an amount equal to the sums thus already paid to
the claimants.
PEACE AND HOOD WILL.
The death of Queen Victoria caused the people
of the United States deep and heartfelt sorrow, to
w-hich the government gave full expression. When
President McKinley died our nation in turn re
ceived from every quarter of the British Empire
expressions of grief and sympathy no less sincere
The death of the Empress Dowager Frederick of
Germany also aroused the genuine sympathy of the
American people; and this sympathy was cordially
reciprocated by Germany when the President was
assassinated. Indeed, from every quarter of the
civilized world we received, at the time of the
President's death, assurances of such grief and re
gard as to touch the hearts of our people. In the
midst of our affliction we reverently thank the
Almighty that we are at peace with the nations
of mankind: anj we firmly intend that our policy
shall be such as to continue unbroken these inter
national relations of mutual respect and goodwill.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
BANQUETS IS MEXICO.
The latest papers at hand from Mexico publish
an interesting narrative of the excursion made to
some Mexican locality by the delegates to the Pan-
American Congress, before taking up in earnest
the labors which were to follow their previous or
ganization. The delegates started for their >x
cursion soon after the holding of the banquet ten
dered them at Mexico by the delegation of the
United States. The speeches addressed then to their
guests by the American delegates were answered
on behalf of South America by Seflores Calderon,
of Peru, and Matte, of Chili. The speech of Senor
Manuel Alvarez Calderon. Minister of Peru, at
Washington, and also a delegate at the Pan-Ameri
can Congress, was a eulogy of the United States,
whose policy, he said, toward the Latin-American,
republics had ever been noble, generous and disin
terested. Dispatches have been published since
showing that Sen.ir Calderon did not speak pro
forma and from mere politeness, but that he meant
what he said, for he has asked that the United
States should act as arbitrator in deciding the
little controversy about the frontier limits which
Bolivia and Peru have quite recently agreed to
submit to unlimited and compulsory arbitration.
It was thp oldtime friend of Peru, Senor Fernando
E. Gu.'.chall i. ihf Bolivian Minister to the United
States. Venezuela and Mexico, and chief of the
Bolivian delegation tr> th»- Pan-American Congress,
who was chosen as spokesman of all the delegates
to th.it congress to answer the toast of
Governor Theodore Dehesa at the banquet at
Orizab.i. Senor Guachalla eloquently and faithfully
expressed the high opinion which bad been created
in the minds of the delegair-p by the spectacle of th*
various mills and factories they had visited during
their excursion in thf Sfatp of Vera Cruz. He
spoke highly of the gr^at industrial and commercial
progress marir- by Mexico, founded upon ideas and a
■yet em of order and liberty. The Bolivian diplomat
ev..-n sprinkled his speech with delicate poetry, when
he said, speaking of Orizaba, tht- city whose guests
the delegates were:
"How could we not h^ happy at our reception in
thi« 'paradise of giy waters, according to the an
cient meaning of the name Orizaba? We ohall keep
forever In our hearts the remembrance of these
ret< - and fiestas. I should say, rather that we
shall leave our h.-,-)r«> here and carry with us the
cherished souvenir of Orizaba.**
