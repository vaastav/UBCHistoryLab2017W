THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
President Harbison by hil
annual message, has certainly
placed himself in the fore grounc
ol his Party, rallying it tx
duties neglected, and calling upoi
them to accomplish that which wil
secure political success in canvas!
es to come.
? is a masterly pn
?Unction, and throughout it al
bears the impress of a statesman
the stamp of a great leader.
\Yhile mere are many question
discussed and reforms advocated
none so deep'y impressed ns as hi
magnificent language in advocac;
of the passage of the Federal Ele
tion Bill
He is in earnest. He believe
circumstances demand it, and ii
the closing lines of his message h
enunciates principles that ar
eternal, words that mast be lac
ing upon tbe ear. Here it ii
Read for yourself.
If any intelligent and loyal com pan
of American citizens were required t
catalogue the essential human cont
lions of national life. I do not doul
tbat with absolute unanimity the
would begin with free, honest election
and it it gratifying to know that gent
ally there is a growing and non-par
san demand for better election law
Bnt against this sign of hope and pi
grt-af* must be set the depressing an
undeniable fact that election laws an
methods are sometimes cunningly ce
trived to secure a minority conTo
while vkaienc? completes tbe shortooi
ines of frauds.
KBXXSRAI, SUPERVISION.
In my-ifHHttDual message I sugge
ed that the eeVt-k
law providing
ial
lopment of the existir
a federal supervision <
congressional elections offered an i
fecilve mt-thod of reforming these abi
es. Tiie need of such a law has mai
festeu itself in many parts of the cou
try snd i's wholesome restraints an
penalties will be useful in alb The cc
ional'.ty of such legislation hi
been aftl m-****? by the huprerie Coar
ltg probable * ttectiveness ls evidence
hy tbe character of rho opposition th
its made to lt. It has be?*n *- enouuet
ss if lt were a new exercise of Feder
power and an invasion of the rights i
the States. Nothing oould be furtb
from the truth. Congress has alrose
fixed the time for the election of me
hers of Congress; it has declared thi
votes for mt-in hers of Congress must t
by written or piinted ballots. It hi
provided for the |appnln**ment, by tl
Circuit Courts, in certain cases ai
uuon the r,etition of a certain numb
of citizens, of election supervisors, at
made lt their duty to supervise the reg
tratlon of voters couducted by tl
State oftlcies, to challenge persons off
ing to register, to personally inspe
and scrutinize the registry-lists, and
etllx t'.ielr Barnes to the lists for tl
purpose of identification and the pi
vent'on of frauds, to attecd at electioi
and remain with rhe boxes till the vot
are aili cast and counted, to attach I
the registry lists and election ret un
any statement touching the accurat
and fairuess of the registry and el*
tion. and to take and tranemit to tl
e'erk of the House of'Representati?
any evidence of fraudulent proce
whioh may be presented to them.
The same law provides for the i
point nent of Deputy* United Stat
marshals to attend at the polls to st
port the supervisors in the discbarge <
their duties and to arrest persons viol
ing the election laws. The provlsioi
ot this familiar title of the Revist
Statute* have been put into exercise t
both the great political p-irtles, and I
the North as well as the South by tl
tiling with the court of the petition
quired by tbe law.
It ls not. therefore a question wheth
we shall have a Federal election hv
for wo now have one, and have had ot
[nearly twenty years, but wheth
di have an effective law Tl
.stops just short of efl oct rt
surrenders to the local %
AX control over the oertifl*
estab ishes prlma facie rig!
seat in the House of Represem
teen This defect should be cure
The equality of representation and tl
parity of the electors must be malnta
ed or the very thing that is valuable
our svstem of government ts lost. Tl
qualifications of an elector must I
bought in the law, not in tbe optnio
prt Judices or fears of any class, ho
ever powerful The pat hot the elect*
to the ballot box must be free from tl
ambush of fear and tbe enticements
fraud; the count so true and open th
.none shall gainsay lt. Such a la
?Miould be absolutely non-partisan an
imf* tial. It should gain the advt
tage to honesty and the control to tl
uikiorities. Surely there is nothii
sectional about this creed, and if
Shall happen that the penalties of tl
lao* Intended to enforce these righ
fall here aud not there it is not beean
tho law ls sectional, but because bi
plly tbe crime is local and not u
venal.
Nor should it be forgotten that evei
law, whether relating to elections or
?toy other t-ubject, whether enacted t
tue state or by tbe nation, has force bi
hind lt. The courts, marshal or cons
bie, the posse cotnitotus, the prison a
all and always behind the law. Oi
ca.* not be justly charged with unfrler
Iii.ess to any section or class wbo seel
only to restrain the violation of law ar
of personal right. Nocommuni'y wi
lina lawlessness profitable. No coma
nlty can afford to have lt known tb:
lae officers, who are charged with the p
?ervstlon of the public peaee and tbe re
stralnt ol tbe criminal classes are them
selves the product ot fraud or violence.
Tbe magistrate ls :hen without respect
and the law without sanction. The
floods of lawlesaoeaa eau uot be leveed
aud made to run la one channel. The
killing ot a United Sta'ec marshal ear
rving a writ of arrest for au eic
offence ls full ot prompting and sugges
tion to men who are pursued by a city
marshall tor a crime against lite or prop
erty.
Bin it ls said tbat this leclslation will
revive animosities, and some have sug
gested that when the peaceful method*
of fraud are made Impooiole they may
be supplanted by intimidation and vlo
lenee. If tbe proposed law gives to any
qualified elector bv a hair's weight mo*e
than his equal Influence or detracts by
so much from any other qua-ified eke
tor lt ls fatally Impeached. But if tbe
law ls equal and the animosities lt ls to
invoke grow out of the fact that soma*
electors have been aocusto ned to exer
else tbe fr neilla? for others as well as
for themselves, then iheae bttg'1-*. not to
be confessed without shame and cannot
be given any weight in tbe discussion
without dishonor No choice is left to
me but to enforce wi h vigor all laws
intended to secure to the en'zan his con
s ti tu ional rights, and to recommend
tbat the inadequates of such laws be
promptly remedied
If to promoto with / tal and ready in
terest eyery project for the develop?
meot of Its material Interests, its rivers,
harbors, mines and factories and tbe in
tell if enc*, peace and secuilty, under
tbe law of lt communi lea and Its homti

friendliness to any State or sectiou, J
cannot add connivance at election prac
tlces that not only disturb local results,
jhut rob the electors of other States and
-sec lons ot their most priceless political
rigbt>
Let tbe Republicans throughout
the South take hope.
President Harrison calls hie
Party to a realization of its duty
and demands legislation which wil!
redeem the pledges made ;n thc
National Convention at Chicago.
Speaker Bred and bis corp 01
followers, stand ready to do theil
duty and the United States Senate
seems to be awakening to tbe fad
that the 'uture success of the Be
publican Party will be decided b-j
their action. If harmony in thi
ranks shall bave been obt-4'nei
tbe President's message will havi
saved ns Irom another nation a
defeat.
We know there ia a dinpositioi
on the part of many Colored peo
pie to feel disheaitened ou aeooun
of tbe recent outcome of the elec
tions.
This should not be so. The-*.
reverses to the Party in power of
ten serve to show them their dutj
and warnings which heeded wi
prove blessings in disguise.
Colored men should not fail t
endeavor to use their right of .rai
