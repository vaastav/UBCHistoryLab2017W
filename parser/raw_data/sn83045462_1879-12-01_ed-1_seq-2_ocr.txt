The M~essaage.
The annual message of President Hayes, laid
before Congress to-day, is a creditable state
paper, and is noticeably devoid of anything of a
partisan nature. He makes the resumption of
Specie payments and the consequent prosperity
the first subject and recommends additional
financial legislation, the most important feature
of which is that the U. S. legal tender notes be
retired. He advises more stringent laws for the
Suppression of polygamy, and earnestly appeals
for entire and complete protection of the right
of suffrage In all sections of the country. Our
relations with foreign countries, the barder
raids, timber depredations, the condition of
Alaska and all the governmental departments
and interests are treated of, and the condition
and needs of each placed before Congress for
proper attention. The President gives his
views at some length upon civil ser
vice reform, maintaining the position
he took in the early days of his
administration against permitting officers of
the government to take an active part in the
control and management of politics. The Pres
ident is especially thoughtful of the interests of
the District of Columbia. He transmits to Con
gress the report of the District Commissioners
and Invites particular attention to the re3om
mendations contained therein. He particflarly
impresses upon Congrers the necessity of legis
lation for 4he reclamation of the Potomac
marshes. He also urges favorable action in be
half of the public schools of the District
and reminds Congress that "the terri
tory of this District is the common prop
erty of the people of the United States,
who equally with Its residents are inter
ested in tl'e prosperity of the Capitol."
Measures thus so earnestly recommended by the
Commissloners and by the President ought
certainly to receive from Congress the attention
they deserve. The Potomac flats have long
been an eyesore that detracts in a large degree
from the beauty of the capital and offsets much
that has been done in the way of improvement.
But the greater consideration that demands
their reclamation is one of health. Not only do
the citizens of the District fall under the baleful
effects of the malaria-producing flats, but mem
bers of Congress and their families furnish
victims, as well as visitors, who in coming to
Washington desire to seek health as well as
pleasure. During the sessions of Congress the
children of members are regular attendants at
tne public schools, and therefore the request for
assistance from Congress is eminently just.
The President in urging Congress to relieve
needs of the District which the "means of the
Commissioners are wholly inadequate for the
accomplishment of " has done an act of justice
which Congress can complete and make effect
ive by promptly carrying out the recommenda
tions.
Legal-Tender Notes.
The recommendations of the President and
the Secretary of the Treasury that the legal
tender quality of United States notes be taken
Sway, is likely now to cause considerable dis
Cu on. This recommendation, however, is no
new departure on the part of republican admin
1strations. In 1874 Secretary Bristow recom
mended as follows: "That after an early and
fixed day United States notes shall cease to be
legal tender as to contracts thereafter to b
made." In 1875 he repeated his recommenda
tion. In 1876 Secretary Morrill, in his annual
report, says: "The United States notes, com
monly known as legal tender, regarded as a
substitute for money, are an anomaly in our
monetary system, tolerable and possible only
in the exigencies of a civil war-the offspring of
its perils and limited to its necessitles. - To
allow their continuance as such after the cause
which justified their existence had ceased, is to
violate the conditions of their inception, and to
sanction what was only tolerable as a necessity,
by impressing upon it the stamp of legitimacy.
* * * The quality of legal tender with which
they were Impressed should have been co-exist
ent only with the necessities of which they were
the offspring. Having served their end, they
existed properly only as evidence of govern
ment Indebtedness, to be provided for as other
debt obligations." In the same year President
Grant recommended to the earnest considera
tion of Congress: "A repeal of so much of the
legal-iender act as makes these notes receiv
able for debts contracted after a date to be fixed
In the act itself, say not later than the 1st of
January, 1877;" which Is substantially the re
commendation of Secretary Sherman.

RET.
LIBERAL REDUCTION OF RENTAL FOR
P7OMPT PAYMENT.
At a meeting of the Board of Directors, Voted:
That in view of the verdict of the U. S. Supreme
Court dissolving the injunction restraining the
Company from reselling the best and centraly lo
cated stalls in the Market thereby disposing of one
more of the expensive and vexatious suits instituted
by these dealers against the Market Company, that
the same discount for prompt or advanced pay
ment (viz. : 20 per cent.) be allowed to all occe ants
of stalls and stands, as was allowed for prom pay
ment previous to the injunction; provide , how
ever, tat this discount shall only be made to the
occupants of such stalls or stands as sign contracts
accepting monthly tenancy, and pay their rental
promptly to the clerk in advance, and also make
arrangeinents for the payment of all arrearages due
the Company. This vote to go Into effect on and
after December 1, 1879, and to continue until
otherwise voted by the Directors.
Reduced rental for prompt payment on average
sized stalls:
Per Month.
Butchers' Stalls.......................$11.20
Butter Dealers' Stands ................. 5.40
Hucksters' Stands.......................... 4.20
Fish Dealers' Stands....................... 4.80
Miscellaneous Stands ...................... 4.80
The above rates include gas and water rents and
policing and cleaning the Market.
The original rental fixed by the Governor of the
District, when the new Market was ready for occu
pancy, and from which the above liberal discount for
prompt payment is now allowed by the Market Com
pany was 55 per centum lower than the aver
rental in the principal Eastern Markets, as will
scen by the following extract from the report of Mr.
Adolf Cluss, who was employed to investigate the
amount of rental charged in other Markets, and
report to a committee in Congress:
[Extraet from Mr. Cluss' Re rt.]
WASHINGTON, D. C., MARKET.
Washington Market Com pany. -The floor-space of
buildings is 57,50 square feet, which yield an aver
age income of $52,000 from rentals, or 90% cents
lper square foot offlor space.
The butchers pay for a stall of 48 square feet an
annual rental of 8168, or $3. 50 per square foot. The
butterinerchants pay for a stallof 36 square feet $81,
or $2.25 per square foot. The bacon dealers pay
$108 p'er stall, or $3 per square foot, and the huck
sters pay $63 orIE.75prUareTfot.
Annual Income Average
per sq. foot rent per
of floor-space sq. foot
In building. of stall.
In Quincy Market (Faneul
H~ail Extension) WIktou$1.94 3.23
In Washington Retail Mar
ket, New York............ 2.02 3.00
In Central Market, Phila.. 1.19 2.32
In Farmers' Market, Phila. 1.09 3.84 tol1.54
Average of the three East
ern cities.................$1.56 $2.95
In Washington Market
Compn's buildings,, in
Was n...............$0 -90% $1.90
The rtsof the p'rincip'al markets of Eastern
cities exceed, therefore, those of Washington city
by 55 per centum.
The difference between the average Income per
square foot of floor-space and the average income
p'er square foot of ground occupled by stalls is
greater In the case of the Washington Market-Com
pany than for any of the other: markets, because,
after consultation and with the a 'probation of the
tenants, previous to the construcnon of the stalls it
w:as decided to throw an unusually large area in the
gangways and aisles. The aisles occupy In the city
markets of Boston 34 per centunm of total floor
space, while In the Washington buildings 53 per
centum are given up for public use.
In making the comparative statements It has
been thought to be most accurate to adopt the occu
pled area as the scale. If as Is sometimes done, the
number of front feet of the stall would have been
taken as the scale, the discrepancy between the dif
ferent cities would have been much geter. For
instance, a Boston stall foots up $57.6 per front
foot, against $28 and $10.50 as the maximum and
mininum of annual stall rent In Washingrton. All
of which is respectfully submitted.
ADOLF CLUSS, Architect.
In view of the above liberal offer on the prt of
the Market Company iis expected that alocca
,'ants of stalls a:' d slands will avail themslves of
the 20 per cent. discount by adjusting all arrearages
and paying their December rent to me promptly In
advance.
