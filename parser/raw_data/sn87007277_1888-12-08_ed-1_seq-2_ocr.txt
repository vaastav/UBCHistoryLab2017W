The President's Message.
On last Monday the President j
furnished his message to Congress,
with suggestions of matters and;
things deemed wormy ot their con- j
sideration. In the outset Mr.Clcve-
land intimates in respectful terms
the necessity of cautious legislation,
and not to repose too confidently
upon the general and too common
opinion of men, that we have
reached that period in our history
when there was no fears of danger
to the perpetuation of the promised
blessings incident to a government
founded as this is, upon the free
dom of the people, and we think
the history of the past very natural
ly leads the mind to the conclusion
that even now there are forces that
menace the perpetuity of the
government, unless proper checks
are placed upon some of the com
binations, that to a very great ex
tent shape legislation to the bene
fit of the few and the prejudice of
the manv, or rather to make the
rich richer, and the poor poorer.
Wise legislation alone can secure
to the American people equality
before the law, and the law making
power in the three departments,
Legislative, Judicial and Executive,
must all exercise their high
functions with singleness of purpose
in meting out to all the most rigid
justice. Our government is now
called upon to control aggregations
of capital, not dreamed of when our
great ship of state started out on
the grand mission now claiming the
attention of patriots and statesmen
of the present day; wealth has as
sumed such fabulous proportions
as to exercise an all-powerful in
fluence in every department of
the government. The President in
j his message grasps the situation,
and emphasizes his former position
prejudice oi uie peopi
mass, and with thc vast accumula
tions of revenue coming in to the
treasury, and the swell of the sur-
pius which is rapidly increasing
lias become an alarming feature in
our national exchequer, and is
threatening the withdrawal of such
colossal sums from the circulating
currency of thc country as to en
danger the best interests ot the
people iu all financial circles out
side of great corporations, monopo
lies and combinations, now being
wielded in many section of thc
country to the damage and oppres
sion of thc common people. In
view of which, he still urges further
reductions of the revenues, and
suggests the reduction of high
tariffs, high taxes, and national
economy. Mr. Cleveland states
that no national complications exist
to the extent of serious adjustment
by an open diplomatic negotiation.
He briefly refers to thc questions
between Great Britain and the
United States, relative to the rights
of American fishermen along the
coast of Canada and New Found
land, and expresses regrets that
thev have not vet met with a satis-
I factorv solut,on and .

The plan will, if carried out, be
equally valuablo in preventing
floods in the Missouri and lower
Mississippi valleys. It is believed
that 150,000 square miles of land
may thus be reclaimed for cultiva
tion. The extent of this may be
seen by the fact that thc total ex
tent of land now under cultivation
in the United States is less then
300,000 square miles. Dams can be
constructed strong enough absolute

Our Washington Letter.
WaswnuTOS, Nov. 30, 1888.
Mr. Cleveland's last annual
message to Congress is all com
plete, and has been submitled to
his cabinet at a meeting called for
the purpose, but what its contents
are, nobody outside knows, or is
likely to know until the document
is read at the Capitol Monday.
The members of the cabinet will
only say that it is a very strong
and interesting document, and that
it will be well worthy of a place
along with the other state papers j Hill is only 5,970 ahead of Mr.
which Mr. Cleveland has written, i Cleveland, and this is fully account
Speaking of this message reminds j ed for by the Republican German
me that Mr. Cleveland has been
particularly fortunate in never
having had any "leaks" in his ad
ministration through which public
documents such as presidential
messages, have reached the public
prematurely. His is the first ad
ministration for many years entire
ly free of these "leaks."
On the eve of tbe first Thanks

took charge of the Navy Depar'.

custom of presenting each one of

of his department with the finest

were greatly enjoyed.
Believing in thc old adage that
"the early bird catches the worm,"
Representative Cannon of Illinois
has opened headquarters here and
began an active canvass for the
Speakership of tbe next House of
Representatives. Messrs. Butter
worth, McKinley, Burrows, Reed
and company, will however make
the fight interesting as soon as they
get here. It is generally thought
that either Reed or McKinley will
be Speaker.
Democratic members of Congress
are as a rule extremely reticent as
to what line of policy they will
adopt at the coming session of Con-
gress; they nearly all express a
desire to confer with their demo-
cratic colleagues before committing
themselves. An exception to this
rule is Representative Springer, of
Illinois. He insists that one of
the first things the House will do
will be to pass his Oklahoma bill,
and that the next thing will be to
pass a bill for the admittance of at
least four Territories intotheUnion
as states.
The clerks in the Government
departments in this city below the
grade of chief are all in an easy
state of mind just at present. They
have become convinced that Harri-1
son is a genuine
civil service re-
former, and that there will be no
clean sweep when he cornea in.
Thc principal cause of this belief
was an article in our local papers, ... . . ...

Harriaon'a Southern tmlirv rnn
tinues to be a subject of general
-
discussion here. The opinion is
almost unanimous among the mem-
bers of both parties, that Harrison's
1
administration will be a very con
servative one unless something now
entirely unexpected should occur.
I don't think the South has any
thing to fear at the bands of Harri
son, If many things that now have
a somewhat troublesome look are
let severely alone, they will adjust
themselves; chief among this class
of things is tbe negro queston. I
am certain from information deriv
ed from republican sources, that
Harrison will appoint no negro to
any prominent federal office in the
South. In fact there is an undoubt
ed disnosition amontr republicans
to relegate the negro to back seats
in future. He is no longer ot any
practical use to that party, there
fore they will give him nothing.
There is a growing belief that
Harrison will call an extra session
of Congress soon after his In
augmaUon. Congress assembled on Monday
morning last.
What the Figures Show.
N. Y. World: The completion of
the State canvass discloses some
interesting and instructive facts.
Gov. Hill leads all the candidates
in the State, receiving more votes j
than President-elect Harrison. Hts
excess over President Cleveland's
vote is 13,849. His plurality over
Warner Miller is 16,707. Harrison
received 10,651 more votes than
Warner Miller, who was last in the
race.
In New York and King's Gov.
vote cast for him for Governor and
Harrison for President. The re
mainder of his excess was obtained
mainly in the "rural districts,"
smong the farmers, except that
Cleveland ran behind in Erie eoun
ty 3,463 votes. Ot the fifty-nine
voting counties of the State, Fulton
and Hamilton voting together, six
teen gave Cleveland more votes
than Hill, and in forty-three Hill
was in the lead over Cleveland. In
all the counties in which Gov. Hill
has great personal strength and in
fluence Mr. Cleveland ran well up !
with his party's vote. The official
fieures triumphantly refute the
Of this New York gave him 57,213
and Kings 11,699. This will con
firm the belief that the purchase of
the venal political bosses of Kings
secured the Republican success.

farmers were not sufficiently or
ganized to fight it successfully, and
the result is a sort of Pyrrhic
victory for thc combine. It has
had "enough," and will not make
the fight again, at least, not for
many years.
But while the movement to do
away with jute bagging and employ
some other material that will ren
der a corner well nigh impossible,
did not accomplish all that was
hoped for, it has started this idea
most auspiciously. Various sub
stitutes for bagging tried in the
Sooth hve Kiven """'section, are
being largely used, considering
that this is the first year they have
been tried; and will in time un
doubtedly come into general use.
Tbe bagging trust itself started a
movement against jute bagging
which must, in time, - drive it com
pletely frcm the field. It is a case
of slow but certain suicide.
It Reads Like Fiction.
KNOWN' TO-DAY.
Sainton Truth: About twenty
ears ago the British governrn.nt
discovered that a bright, intelii
gent Irish lad who had joined the
Eighth Husars was endeavoring to
make certain members of that regi
ment disloyal to the Queen. Indeed,
be had succeeded so Car ae to induce
several of tbe Hussars to throw off
their allegiance to the crown and
swear fealty to tbe cause of Ireland,
with the explicit understanding
that they would fight for Irish in
dependence as soon as the time was
ripe to strike tbe blow. The youth
who had undertaken the dangerous
mission of making revolutionists of
the Queen's soldiers had been a
student of history and gloried in
the career of George Washington
and other American patriots who
shook off the Britsh yoke, and be
felt that the only hope of bringing
prosperity back to Ireland lay in
making that unhappy country free.
Tbe English authorities did not
appreciate his efforts, however, be
cause they were not employed in
tbe interests of the "mother couu-j
try," and he was tried for treason I
and sentenced to death. His ex-
treme youth, his talents, and his j
noble qualities all pleaded against
the execution and so, after a long;homi( ar( kept ftt gomnfflent .

A .Speculation in Cats.
Vicksburg Post: A witty Vicks
burgcr, whose reputation as a joker
is by no means confined to local
circles, went out to Edwards a few
days ago and perpetrated a huge
"sell" on some of the colored
natives. He introduced himself as
Northern capitalist who was about
to open an establishment in this
city for the manufacture of fur and
fiddle-strings. Ho was then en
gaged in going through the country
contracting for raw materials, which
were oats. Ordinary mouscrs he
said were worth $1 25 each, but for
extta fine specimens he would give
SI 50. Ho stated that he had al
ready made large engagements at
Bovina and other stations on the
Vicksburg & Meridian Railroad,
and agreed to receive any quantity
of the felinos at Edwards on the
following day. His hearers took
in the situation and promised
punctuality in deliveries. That
night there was wailing and gnash
ing of teeth in many a backyard in
that vicinity and in the earlv
rhorning about forty darkies, sjach
loaded with three or four cats, came

tractor appeared not, aor has he

Milwaukee Sentinel's Washing
tooLctter: Perhaps the lady readers
of the Sentinel might like to know
something of the experiences which
Mrs. Harrison will have when the

apparel and move into a house com
pletely furnished and filled with
beds and bedding, silver and table
ware, servants and cookingutensils,
or will all or any of these have to
be brought along or provided after
she gets here? That is a question
very often asked, and with it a good
many others, as to horses and
carriage, coachmen and waiting
maids, cost of and payment for the
necessaries of the kitchen end
diningroom, etc. It is a curious
fact that all the cabinet officers are
furnished with horses and carriages
at government expense, but that
tbe president is not. The cabinet
officers are furnished horses, car-
riaM( and Mtaehmen and tha
i penae. If the president wants any
of these things he must supply
them himself. There is a stable
near the White House, built during

for horses, but every president who

One thing that Mrs. Harrison
will find is a completely furnished
house solid silver, the finest of
china, linen for the table and bed
chambers, elegant furnishings in
the parlors and fairly good in the
private parts of the house. The
private dining room is on the first
floor, just across the hall from the
state dining room. This is the
only room on the first floor used by
thc family of the President. The
parlors are used for callers, and tbe
entire family or "living" rooms are
on the second floor. There are,
perhaps, half a dozen of these,
scarcely more, a sitting room or
two near the circular "library
room," where the President site
during his business and working
hours, and several handsomely
furnished bed-rooms and dressing
rooms. An elevator carries the
family down-stairs at meal time,
and when they go down for other
purposes if they desire it: aa a rule
they walx up and down the broad,
easy and luxui iously carpeted stairs
and through the handsome and al
ways, ittrsttive oorridors winch
lead the way to the dining rooms
and parlors on the first floor. There
they find everything ready, for the
experienced steward is able to rs
lieve the mistress of the White
House of all the cares of house
keeping -if he is well paid for it.
