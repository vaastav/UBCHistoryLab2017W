forts of the audience to secure an exit. The
flro broke out on the stage Just before tho
time for tho curtain to rise, and is said to
have been caused by the falling of a kerosene
lamp. In a brief moment tho curtain and
scenery were enveloped in flames, and soon
after thcro was an explosion of gas. The
audience wore naturally panic-stricken and
tho ordinary exits became blocked by
struggling mass of humanity, A largo num

break their fall. The number of lives lost
is estimutcd as high as 000. Up to
tho morning of tho 0th 400 bodies
had been recovered, and the fourth
gallery had not yet been explored. It is be
lieved that not a single person escaped from
that gallery, and that very few escaped from
the third gallery. The corpses last recovered
aro little moro than charred fragments.

It was generally understood in Wash

President Arthur took formal pos

was unaccompanied, and after entering the

then went through tho upper part of tho

The report of the Uto Commissioners
to the Secretary of tho Interior is very volu

recommendations are: That the present
boundaries of the reservation bo established
permanently; that tho few settlers now on
the reservation 1)0 paid a reasonable com

It was two years ago on the
8th of November that a similar disaster oc
curred. That time it was the third span;

Commissioners made a report that the bridge
was perfectly safe, and only a day
previous to tho accident one of tho
Commissioners inspected tho struc

In theeourso of his remarks Mr. Davis said:
"Lust soring I took occasion to stato
tho reasons why my votes should
be given to sustain tho existing organ
l.nlt.m of the Senate. Although cir
cumstances havo materially changed since
that timo, tho obligation which I vol

hence I adhere to that declaration, always

Mr. Morrill moved a reference of the subject

r.loomlnydale Asylum, replied toahypolhet
leal question proposed by Scovillc: " If the
evidence to which 1 have listened Is correct,
1 should say the prisoner is insane." Dr.
Folsom, lloston, Dr. (Sodding, of I ho Gov
ernment Insane Asylum, Washington, Dr.
Mcltride, ot Milwaukee, and Dr. Chan
nin;,, ot Jlrookliiie, Mass., concur
red substantially in the opinion
of Dr. Kennon. President Arthur, who
was sulqaciiaed by the defense, 'was not
called to the stand, hut submitted Ills writ
ten answers to several Interrogatories. The
siibslancc of Ids replies was: He knows the
prisoner, having seen him at leas', ten times,
possibly twice that number; had never con
versed with him "excepting to return the
ordinary salutation of the day, and once or
twice In answer to his request to be employ
ed In the campaign ns a speaker by the Re
publican State Committee, of which 1 was
Chairman." To the question: "What polit
ical services the prisoner had rendered the
Republican party during tho last Trcsidcn
Hal campaign V the answer is: "None that
1 know of." To the question whether thoro
was anything in the prisoner's relations to
himself or Gen. Grant, or Senator Conkllng,
or any of the others of tho Republican par
ty, socially or politically, to furnish him
with uv ground for supposing he would
receive any political preferment, the answer
is "No." Prisoner. "That is a matter of
opinion." The last question was: "Did
you ever give him any reason to think that
"he could have any political or personal in

Prisoner, "lie never had occasion to.'
The President adds tohis answers the follow
ing: "1 hrtve been requested by counsel for
the defense to produce a letter written by

Tlm Semite, resolutions of condolence on tho
nssiiiatlon of tho Czar Alexander Second woro
which its onvov had assumed, nnd bv n pro
posnl for renewed negotiation on a modified
basis. Menuwhiln this Government learned
thut Colombia had proposed to the Kuropean
Powers to Join In a guarantee of tho neu
trality of tho proposed Panama Canal,
a guarauteo which would be in direct
contravention of our obligation a the
solo guarantee of tho integrity of Colombian
territory, and of the neut rality of tbe canal

duty to jilueo before tho Kuropean powers
thn reasons u-bhdi make the nrior cunrantoe
of the United States Indispensable, and for
which the interjection of any foreign guaran
tee might bo regarded as u superfluous nnd
nnfriondlv act. Foreseeing tho probnblo re
liance of the British Government on the pro
visions of the Clavton-Ilulwer treaty of lHoO,
as affording room for a share In tho guaran
tees which tho United States covenanted
with Colombia four years before, I huvo not
hesitated to supplement the action of mv
Credecessor b y proposing to ht'r Mnjosty'g
overimient tho modification ot that instru
ment and tho abrogation of such clauses
thereof ns do not comport with the obliga
tions ot tho United States toward Colombia or
with tho vital needs of the tho two friendly
purtics to tho compact.
This Government sees with great concern
the continuance of tho hostile relations be
tween Chill, Ilolivla nnd Peru. An early
peace between tlieso republics is much to be
desired, not only that they may bo spared
further misery and bloodshed, but because
their continued antagonism threatens con
sequences which are, in my Judgment, dan
gerous to tne interests oi repuoucun govern
ments and calculated to destroy tho best elo
ment of our free and peaceful civilization. As
in tho present excited condition of popular
feeling in these countries there has been se
rious misapprehensions of tho position of the
United States, and as separate diplomatic in
tercourse with each through independent
ministers is sometimes subject, owing to tlio
want of prompt reciprocal communication, to
temporary misunderstanding, I have deemed
It. judicious nt the present time to send a spe
cial envoy accredited to all and each of them,
fiiniTshed with general instructions which
will, 1 trust, enuble them to bring these pow-
f.fa Intn frbinillv relations.
