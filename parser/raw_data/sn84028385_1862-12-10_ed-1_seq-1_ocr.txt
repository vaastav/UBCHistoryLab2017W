NEGRO COLONIZATION.
Applications have heen made to me by
many free Americans of African descent,
lavor their emigration with a view to
colonization as was con 1 pin plated in re
cent acts of Congress. .;, Other parties at
home and abroad, some .from iutereted
motives others upon patriotic principles,
Mill others influenced bv philanthro
' sentiments,. have suggested similar
tneasures, while on the oUier hand, eeve
ral of the Wpanish '' Ameiican republics
have protested against the . sending of
colonies to their respective territo
ries. Under liese. circiiiqstanoes I ha VP
decluMl to move any suoh colony to any
State, without, first obtaining the consent
its government, with an agreement on
theirpartto receive and protect such em
grants in all their rights a freemen. !
have at the same time offered- to several
Sta,tes situated in the tropics, or having
colonies there, to negotiate' with them,
subject to the advice and consent of the
Senate, Vo favor Lhe voluntary emigration
portions of that class 4q their respW
'territories tipoh conditions which
be just and humane.
Liberia and Hay ti are yet theonly ooun
to which colonists of African descent
here could go with certainty of be
ing received and adopted as citizens,-and
regret to say. that such persons con tem
plaung colonization do not seem so will
ing Io emigrate to these countries as to
some others, nor as willing as I. think
their interest demands, I believe, how
ever, that the opinion; ' Is improving, and
ere long there will be an augmented
considerable emigration to both' these
countries ; from the United States. .... ;.,

COMMERCIAL RELATIONS.
The pew eoramerclal treaty between,
United States end the Sultan of Tur
key, lias been carried into execution. A
commercial and consular treaty has been
negotiated, subject to the Senate's- con
sent, with Liberia, and a similar negotia
tion U how pending with the Republic of
Hayti. A considerable improvement of
national commerce, is expected Jo re-
from these meannres. ii
Our'relafiona with Great Britain, France,
Spain, ' Portugal, Russia, - Prussia, ' ten-
mark, Sweden and Austria, the Nether
lands, Italy. Rome, and other European
States, remain undisturbed. 'Veryifavor

been uo clJHiige ol our previous relations
with the inUeiietident States of uir eon

THE TERRITORIES.
llie lerntones of the United Stales
with unimportant exceptions have re
mained undisturbed by civil war, and
they have exhibited such . evidences of
prosperity as justifies au expectation that

to be orcanued as states,' and be consti
tutionally admitted into the federal
Union. The immense mineral resources
of some of these territories ought to be
developed as rapidly as possible.
ivery step in that direction would have
tendency to improve the revenues of
the government and flimiuish the bur
dens of the people.
It is worthy of your serious considera
tion . whether some extraordinary meas
ures to promote that end cannot be
adopted. .
The means which suggests itself as most
likely to be effective is a scientific explo
ration of the mineral regiops it) tlito

its result at home and iu foreign eoun

THE NATIONAL FINANCES.
The condition of the finances will claim !
your most diligent consideration. The
vast expenditures incident to the milita
ry and naval operations required f.r the
suppression of the rebellion, have hither
to been rriet hy a nromplitude and cer
tainty1 unusual in similar oircumstam-es.
and the public credit has been fully main
tained. . . lhe continuance of the war,
however, and the increased disbursement!
made necessary by the augmented forces
bow in the field, demand your best reflec
tion as to' the best modes of providing
the necessary revenue without injury tq
business, afld with the least' possible bur
dens opon labor. The. suspension of spe
cie payment by the banks soon alter the
commencement of your last session, uiade
large issues of United States notes un
avoidable. - Jn no other way could the
payment of the troops and the satisfac
tion of other just demands be so eeonom
ically or as well provided for, The judi-
cious legislation of Cpngresg securing the
reoeivability q( these notes for loans and I
internal duties, and making them a legal
fender for other debts has made them unt-
yet4i currency, and. iw 5tiafie4, partial
ly at least, and for the time, the long felt
want of a uniform circulating medium,
saving thereby' to the people immense
sums in discounts and exolianees. A re
turn tq specie payments, however, at tbe
earliest period compatible with due re
gard to all interests, should ever be kept
in view. Fluctuation in th.e vajua of
currency are always injurious, and to re
duce, these. fluctuations' tq )he lowest pos
sible point will always be a leading pur
pose m wise legislation.. Prompt and
oertain convertibility into coin is general
ly acknowledged to be the best and surest
against them, and it is extremely doubt
ful whether a circulation of United States
notes, payable it coin, and sufficiently
large for the wants of the people, can Im
permanently psefully and, daftly maintain
ed '-fai tlwrelany other! inode in which
the rlecessary provision for the public
wants' can be made and the groat adyan-
tagtjs ui 'a and uniform currency se
pured? if know of none which promises
so certain results and at the same time so
unobjectionable as - the organization of
banking associations under a general act
of Congress, -well guarded in its provi
sions. Jlosucn associations ffm govern
ment might furnish circulating notes on
the security of United States bonds de
posited In the Treasury. These notes,
prepared under the supervision of proper
officers, being uniform in appearance and
security, and convertible aiwavs into coin,
would" at once protect labor against the
evils of a vicious currency, and facilitate
commerce by cheap and safe exchanges.
4 moAjorafo reservation from llie interest
on the bonds would compensate the Uni
ted btates tor the preparation and distri
bution of the notes, and a general super
vision of thyo system, and would lighten
the burden ol that part of the publio
debt employed ft security. The publio
credit, moreover, . would be g'.-eatly im
proved, and the negotiation of new loans
greatly facilitated, by the steady market
demand for government bonds, which the
adoption of the proposed syster.j would
create.tr-'.-5-i .
' It ia an additional recommendation a
the measure of considerable weight in mv
judgement that it would reconcile, as far
as possible, all existing interests by the
opportunity ottered to existing institu
tions to re-organize under the act substi
tuting only the secured, uniform national
circulation for the local and various circu
lations, secured and unsecured, now is
sued by them. -

and leavine a balance in the Treasury on
the first day of July, 1862, of $ 13,043,440-

being included also- ia the loans made,
may be properly deducted both from the

PACIFIC RAILROAD.
J submit a statement of the proceed
ings of the Commissioners which shows
the progress that has been made in the
enterprise of constructing the Pacific
railroad, and this suggests the earliest
completion of the road, and also the fa
vorable action of Congress upon the Proj

ing tne capacity or the great canals in
New York and Illinois, as beine of vital
and rapidly incr?asipg importance to the
woie nation,' atfd especially to the vast
interior hereinafter to be fioticed at some
greater length. I propose having prepar
and laid before you at an early day
some interesting and valuable statistical
information on this subject. "
The military and commercial Import

have caused the Department of Agricul

The Oommssiorter informs me' within the
period of a- few months this department
has established an extensive system of ex
tensive correspondence and exchanges
both at home and abroad, which promis
highly beneficial results in the develop

improvements in agriculture,' to the intro

- This it wonld seem must further miti-
cate the dissatisfaction of those who fav-1
or peqietual slavery, and especially those
who are to receive compensation. Doubt-
less some of those who are to pay, and
not to receive, will obiect. i et that the
measure is both lust and economical is
certain. The liberation of the slave is
the destruction of property acquired by
descent and by purchase, the same as any
other property. It is no less true for ha v-
in been often said that the people of the
South are no more responsible for the in-1
traduction of this property than are the I
neonleof the North, and when it is re-1
membered how unhesitatingly we all have
cotton and sngar, and bhare the prof-
iu of dealing in them, it may not be quite
safe to sav that -the South has been more
responsible than, the Jjorth for its oontin-1
uance. If. then, for a common obiect.
this property i to be aacrificed. is it not
just that it be done at a common eharge? I
And if with less money, or money more I
easily taid. we can preserve the benefits
of the Union by thin means than we can
by the war alone, is it not econoirical to
it? -: ' ""' ' ly
; tet us consider It then. Let us kscer- or
tain the sum we have" expended in the do
war since compensated emancipation was
proved last March, and consider wheth-
er if that measure had been promptly ac-1
cepted bv even some of the Slave States,
same sum would not have done more
to close the war than has been otherwise
done. If so. the measure would save
money, and in that view would bo a pru-
dent and economical measure certainly.
It is not sq easy to pay soraethin as it is
to pay nothing, but it is easier to pay I
large sum than it is to pay a larger one,
and it is easier to Day anv sum when we I
are able than, it is to pay it beforo we are I
able. The war reauires them at once. I
The aagregate sum necessary for compen-
"emancipation of course would be ly
large, but it would require no ready cash
nor bondsmen any faster than the eiuan-
cipation progresses. This might hot, and
probably would not, close before he end i
of the thirty seven ver,rs. At th it time

injure and displace white labor and white

time for mere arguments, that time is
surely not now. In times like the pres-

because of the abolishment of j slavery i
the District of Columbia last spring
What I have said of the proportion bf
free colored persons to the whites in tie
District of Columbia is from the census
of 1860, having no reference "to persona
called contrabands, nor by those made
free by the act of Congress abolishing
slavery here.
The plan consisting of these articles is
recommended, not but that a xestmation
of the national authority would be accep
ted without its adoption, nor wiH the war
or proceedinm under the proclamatiott of
September 22d, 1862, be staved because
of the recommendation of this plan. Its
timeiy adoption, i aouDl not, woo Id bring
restoration, and thereby stay both-. And
notwithstanding this plan; the J rec
ommendation that Congress provide by
law for compensating any State which
may adopt the emancipation before thia
plan shall have been acted upon, is earn
estly renewed. Such would only be. an'
advance part of the plan, and the-same
arguments apply to both. This plan ia
recommended as a means, not in conclu
sion of. but additional to. all other for re
storing and preserving the national aos
thority throughout the Union. ' Tbe sub-
ject is presented exclusively in it - ccok
nomicai aspect. i. i
i ne plan would, I am confident Beetrre
peace more speedily than can be done by
force alone, while it would cost less con- -
sidering amounts and manner of Davmeni
and times of payment, and the amounts
would be easier paid than will be the d-
monal cost or the war if we rely solely
pon force. It is most likely that very
kely would cost no blood at all. ' The
plan is proposed as permanent conatitit
tional law. It cannot become such wirb
out the concurrence, first,- of two-thirds of
Congress tnd afterwards three-fourths of
the States.' The reauisite three-onartera
the States will necesaarilly include-ser;
of the slave States. If obtained it wiU
give assnaance of their severally adopting
emancipation at no distant day upon the
new constitutional terms. This assurance
would end the struggle now and save the;
Union forever.

What Must be Done in a Year.
"What Abraham Lincoln proposes to do
bringing the rebels into subjugation
be done in one year. If tbe war
languishes the democratic party will clam
or for peace.' If it in pushed vigorously.
will be dragged into its support ami
approval. The President, by having tha
in his hands, and another session of a
friendly Congress, has his future in hie
hands, and, to a certain extent, the future,
the party which, elected him. He must
the war. His own reputation, the
honor of his country, the necessities of
world, demand that within one year
armies of the rebels shall be defeated,
ports and forts re-possessed, THiia

not done in that time, it will never be.
