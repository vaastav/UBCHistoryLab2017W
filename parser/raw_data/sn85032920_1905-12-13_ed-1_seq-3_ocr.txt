PRESIDENNT ROOSEVELT'S
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS
A Masterly Document Treating of Railroad Rates, Insur
ance Matters And Many Other Questions of Vital
Importance Including That of Joint Statehood.
"WASHINGTON, Dec 5 President:
Ttoosevclt's message to Congress re
ceived the attention of the house for
two and a half hours today. Its read
ing was listened to with marked at
tention, and at its conclusion the docu
ment was applauded.
Preliminary steps were taken toward
appropriating the needed emergency
funds for the Panama canal, and it
-will bo the business for tomorrow.
Should unanimous consent be refused
its consideration, a special rule from
the committee on rules will be enforc
ed which will put the bill on its pas
sage after a limited time for discus
sion. The House received and ordered re
ferred to one of the regular election
committees a protest from the fifth
congressional district of Blinois stat
ing that Anthony Michalek, who was
yesterday sworn in as a member of the
House from that district, is not a citi
zen of the United States. The protest
was presented by Eainey, of that state,
who asked consideration of the mat
ter by a special committee. This point
was the only one contested, it being
suggested by Mr. Mann that it was a
matter proper for the elections com
mittee to consider, and his amendment
to this effect was adopted by a yea and
nay vote.
On motion of Goldfogle. of New
cork, a resolution was read, express
ing the sympathy of the American
people for the distressed Russian Jews.
The resolution was ordered printed on
the record, and referred to the com
mittee on foreign affairs.
President Roosevelt's message was
as follows:
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives: ..
The people of this country
to enjoy great prosperity. Undoubt
edly there ill be ebb and flow in such
prosperity, and this ebb and flow will
be felt more or less Tiy all members of
the community, both by the deserving
and the undeserving. ,

So long as the finances of the na
tion1 are kept upon an honest basis no
other question of internal economy
with which the congress has the
power to deal begins to approach in
importance the matter of endeavoring
to secure proper industrial conditions
under which the individuals and es
pecially the great corporations doing
an interstate business are to act. The
makers of our national constitution
provided especially that the regula
tion of interstate commerce should
come within the sphere of the general
government. The arguments in favor
of their taking this stand were even
then overwhelming. But they are far
stronger today, in view or. tne enor
mous development of great agencies,
usually corporate in form. Expedi
ence has shown conclusively that it is
useless to try to get any adequate regu
lation and supervision of these great
corporations by state action. Such
regulation ana supervision cau uj

that is, by the national government. I
believe that this regulation and super
vision can be obtained by the enact
ment of law by the congress. If this
nrnvps imnossible. it will certainly be
necessary ultimately to confer in full
est form such power upon tne national
government by a proper" amendment of
the constitution. It would obviously
be unwise to endeavor to secure 3uch
an amendment until it is certain that
the result can not be obtained under
th punct itntinn as it now is. The
laws of congress and the several states

these evils.
As 1 said in my message of De
cember r last, the immediate and most
pressing need, o far as legislation is
concerned, is the enactment into law
of some scheme to secure to the agents
of the government such supervision
and regulation of the rates charged by
the railroads of the country engaged
in interstate traffic as shall summarily
stop unjust or unreasonable rates. If
must include putting a complete stop
to rebates in every shape and form.
This power to regulate rates, like all
similar powers over the business world,
should be exercised with moderation,
caution and self-restraint; but it
should exist, so that it can be effect
ively exercised when the need arises.
The first consideration to be kept in
mind is that the power should be
affirmative and should be given to
some administrative body created by
the congress. If given to the present
interstate commerce commission or to
a reorganized interstate commerce
commission, such commission should be
made unequivocally administrative. I
do not believe in the government inter
fering with private business more than
is necessary. I do not believe in the
government undertaking any work
which can with propriety be left in
private hands. But neither do I be
lieve in the government flinching from
overseeing any work when it becomes
evident that abuses are sure to obtain
therein unless there is governmental
supervision. It is not my province to
indicate the exact terms of the law
which should be enacted; but I call
li nttpntinn nf thn rnnfnress to certain
existine conditions with which it is
desirable to deal. In my judgment the
most important provision which such
law should contain is that conferring
upon some competent administrative
body the power to decide, upon me
brought before it. whether
a given rate prescribed by a railroad
is reasonable and just, anu ii ii ia
found to be unreasonable and unjust,
ition nftpr full investigation of the
complaint, to prescribe the limit of
rate beyond wnicn it snail not oe law
ful tn m thp maximum reasonable
rate, as it is commonly called this de
cision to go into euect witnin a rea
sonable time and to obtain from thence
onward, subject to review by the
courts. It sometimes happens at pres
ent, not that a rate is too high, but
that a favorite shipper is given too
low a rate. In such case the commis
sion would have the right to fix this
nlrpmlv established minimum: and it
would need only one or two such de
cisions by the commission to care rail
road companies of the practice of giv
ing improper minimum rates. I call
attention to the fact that my proposal
is not to give the commission power
to initiate or originate rates generally,
but to regulate a rate already fixed
or originated by the roads, upon com
plaint and after investigation.
Illecal transactions often occur under
tho fnrms nf law. It has often oc
curred that a shipper has been told by
a traffic officer to buy a large quan
tity of some commodity ana tnen aer
it hns hep'n bniifht an open reduction
is mnrlfi in the rate to take effect im
mediately, the arrangement resulting
to the proht ot the one snipper anu iub
nnp rnilrnnd JlTld to the damacre of all
lipir pnmnptitnrs: for it must not be
fnrrrnttpn that tne dip snippers uro ai
least as much to blame as any rail
rnn.1 in thp matter of rebates. The
Inn. sVinnlil mnlcp it clear SO that DO
iinW pnn f.iil to understand that any
kind of commission paid on freight
shipments, whether in this form or in
hp tnrm nf tiptitinus aamaces. or oi
i pnnppssinn. fl free pass, reduced pass
cnger rate, or payment of brokerage,
is illegal. It is worth wnue consiuer-ino-
irhpthpr it would not bo wise to
confer on the government the right
nf pit-il nrtinn nirninst the beneficiary
of a rebate tor at least twice tne vmuu
nf thn rebate: this would help stop
. . , j 1
whnt is reallv blackmail. Elevator
allowances should be stopped, for they
hnvp nnw rrown to such an extent
that they are demoralizing and are used
as rebates.

Thp nriv-itp-pnr owners and the owners
of industrial railroads are entitled to
a fair and reasonable compensation on
fhpir invpstmpnt. hut neither private
cars nor industrial railroads nor spur
tmpks should be utilized as devices
fnr Kpcnrinf preferential rates. A re
lifitn in irino- oharfres. or in mileace, or
in a division of the rate for refriger
ating charges is just as pernicious a
a rebate in any other way. No lower
rate should apply on goods imported
than actually obtains on domestic
goods from the American seaboard to
destination except in cases where
water competition is the controlling
influence. There should be publicity of
the accounts of common carriers; no
common carrier engaged in interstate
business should keep any books or
memoranda other than those reported
pursuant to law or regulation, and
these books or memoranda should be
open to the inspection of the govern
ment. Only in this way can viola
tions or evasions of the law be surely
detected. A system of examination of
railroad accounts should be provided
similar to that now conducted into the
national banks by the bank examiners;
a few first-class railroad accountants,
if they had proper direction and
proper authority to inspect books and
papers, could accomplish much in pre
venting willful violations of the law.
It would not be necessary for them to
examine into the accounts of any rail
road unless for good reasons they were
directed to oo so Dy xne miersiaie

traffic are controlled by concessions on

amounts to an evasion of the law. The

but a very bad thing for a nation.
This government stands for manhood

In such a republic as ours the one thing
that wn can not auoru to net'iect is
the problem of turning out decent citi

nM thpep nrhn tnmnrrnw will shnne the
destiny of our land, and we con not
afford to neglect tnem.
Thp ilpnnrtment nf commerce and
labor should also make a thorough in
vestigation of the conditions of women
in industry. Over five million Ameri
can women are now engaged in gainful
occupations; yet there is an almost
complete dearth o data upon whieh,
to base any trustworthy conclusions aa
regards a subject as important as it ia
vast and complicated. There is need
of full knowledge on -which to baaa
action looking toward state and muni
cipal legislation for the protection of
working women. Tho introduction oi
women into industry is working chango
and disturbance in the domestic and
social life of the nation. The de
crease in marriage, and especially in
the birth rate, has been coincident with,
it. We must face accomplished facia,
and toe adjustment to factory condi
tions mast be made; but surely it can
be made with less friction and less
harmful effects on family life than iv
now the case.
The question of securing a healthy,
self-respecting, and mutually sympa
thetic attitude as between employer
and employee, capitalist and wage
worker, is a difficult one. All phases
of the labor problem prove difficult
when approached. But the underlying
principle, tho root principles, in ac
cordance with which the problem must
be solved are entirely simple. We can
get justice and right dealing only ii
we put as of paramount importance
the principle oi treating a man on ma
worth as a man rather than with ref
erence tn his social position, his occu
pation or the clas3 to which ho be
longs.
Individual capitalist and individual
wage-worker, corporation and union,
are alike entitled to the protection of
the law, and must alike obey tho law.
Moreover, in addition to mere obedi
ence to the law, each man, if he . be
really a good citizen, must show broad
sympathy for his neighbor and genuino
desire to look at any question arising
between them from the standpoint of
that neighbor no less than from hia
vn.
In the past the most direful among
the influences which have brought
about the downfall of republics has
ever been the growth of class spirit,
the growth of spirit which tends to
make a man subordinate the welfare of
the public as a whole to the welfare oi
loyalty to a class for loyalty to the
nation. This inevitably brings about
a tendency to treat each man not on
his merits as an individual, but on his
position as belonging to a certain class
in the community. If sucn a spirit
grows up in this republic it will ulti
mately prove fatal to us, as in the
past it has proved fatal to every com
munity in which it has become domi
nant. Unless we continue to keep a
quick and lively sense of the great
fundamental truth that our concern is
with the individual worth of the indi
vidual man, this government can not
permanently hold the place which it
has achieved among the nations. In
other words, the standard we should
establish is the standard of conduct,
not the standard of occupation, of
means, or of social position. It is
the man's moral quality, his attitude
toward the great questions which con
cern all humanity, his cleanliness ot
life, his power to do his duty toward
himself and toward others, which really
count: and if we substitute for the
standard of personal judgment which
treats each man according to his mer
its, another standard in accordance
with which all men of one class are fa
vored and all men of another class dis
criminated against, we shall do Irre
parable damage to the body politic.

Insurance.
The srreat insurance companies af
ford striking examples of corporations
whose business has extended so far be
yond the jurisdiction of tho states
which created them as to preciuao
strict enforcement of supervision and
regulation by the parent states. In
my last annual message I recommend
ed "that conjrress caretully consider
whether the power of the bureau of cor
porations can not constitutionally be
extended to cover interstate transac
tions in insurance." Bccent events
have emphasized the importance of an
early and exhaustive consideration oi
this question, to see wnetner it is not
possible to furnish better safeguards
than the several states have been iblo
to furnish against corruption of the
flagrant kind which has been exposed.
It has been only too clearly shown that
certain of the men at the head of
these large corporations take Dut small
note of tho ethical distinction be
tween honesty and dishonesty; they
draw the line only this side ot what
may be called law-honcsty, the kind
of honesty necessary in order to avoid
falling into the clutches of tho law.
Of course the only complete remedy
for this condition must be found in
an aroused public conscience, a higher
sense of ethical conduct in the com
munity at large, and especially among
business men and in the great pro
fession of the law, and in the growth
of a spirit which condemns all dis
honesty, whether in rich man or in
poor man, whether it takes the shape
of bribery or of blackmail. But much
can be done by legislation which is
not only drastic but practical. There
is need of a far stricter and more uni
form regulation of the vast insurance
interests of this country. The United
States should in this respect follow
the policy of other nations bv pro
viding adequate national supervision
of commercial interests which are
clearly national in character. My
predecessors have Tepcatedly recog
nized that the foreign business of the.w
companies is an important part of their
commercial relations. During the ad
ministration of Presidents Cleveland,
Harrison and McKinley the state de
