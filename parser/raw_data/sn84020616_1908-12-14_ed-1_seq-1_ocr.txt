Investigation Will Continue Says
Roosevelt. It Having Been
Proven That Negroes
Shot up the
Town.
Washington, Dec. 14. President
Roosevelt today sent a message to
Congress, Inclosing a letter from the
s'cretary of war In transmitting
report of the Investigation made by
Herbert J. Browne, employed toy the
dt .artment In conjunction with Cap-
14, 1904. The message in part Is aa
follows:
..Thu report enables us to fix with
tiPr.bla deflnltenewi. at least, the
identification of some of the crim
inals who took the lead In the mur
derous shooting of. private citixens
at Brownsville. It establishes clearly
the fact that colored soldiers did the
shooting. The Investigation, how-
ever, has not gone far enough to en
able us to determine all the facts tnd
we will proceed with It.
"It appears that almost all the
members of B company must have
teen actively concerned In the shoot
ing, either to the extent of being par-
tio,pant8f 0r to the extent of virtually
encouraging those who were partici
pants.
s tc. cTnr',Tlea O nd D, there
can be no question that practically
every man In them must have had
knowledge that the shooting was
dona by some members of B troop,
and po,gibiy by one or two others
i ona of the other troops. This con-
cealment was a grave offense of
Itself, and was sreatlr aczrtvated by
tneir testifying before the , Senate
committee that they were ignorant
ot what they must have known.
"Nevertheless, it is to be said in
partial exoneration that they were
probably cowed by threats made by
the more desperate men who had
actually been engaged in shooting, as
to what would happen to any man
who failed to protect the wrong-do-
ers, Moreover, there are circum-
stances tending to show that these
misguided men were encouraged by
outsiders to persist in their course of
concealment and denial.
; "I feel, therefore, that some meas-
ure of allowance should be made for
the misconduct of those men. In
otner words, I believe we can afford
I to reinstate any of those men who
' now truthfully tell what happened.
g ve all the aid they can to fix the
I rt-cronalblllty upon those who are
really guilty, and show that they,
- themselves, had no guilty knowledge
bi forehand and were In no way lm
plicated in the affair. ave by having
knowledge of it afterwards and fall-
lng and refusing to divulge it.
"I recommend that a law be pass-
ed. allowing the secretary of war,
within a fixed period of time, say a
year, to reinstate any of those sol
tilers whom he, after a careful ex
amlnatlon, finds have been Innocent
and whom be finds to nave done an
In their power to help bring to jus-
tlce the guilty. Meanwhile the inves
tlgatlon will D continued.
I The report submitted by Browne
ays: "iot-rrivate Boya conyers or
, company B, Twenty-nrth infantry,
now at Monroe, Ga., told William
Law son, a detective, that he and
three or four others, all men of the
Twenty-fifth Infantry, were leaders
ir. the Brownsville raid. Conyera
tried to commit suicide after he found
out that he had made his statement
to a detective, saying that the other
irproes would kill him when he got
tot
"He finally wrote to Senator For
aker and received a reply. That re
ply he construed to mtan that he
shiuld stick to his erlglnal story told
b. fore the Senate committee, at all
hazards, an I there he Hands."
The report Us accompanied by affi
davits in support of the statements
made oy Browne.
According to Conyer's alleged con
fession. John Holleman, a money
lender of Company B, was the chief
conspirator and leader In the raid,
and the custodian and distributor of
cartridges, but his plana could not
have been carried out had not Ser
geant George Jarksun, of Company
B, in charge of the keys to the gun
racks, and Sergeant Reld, In com
mand of the guards, co-operated
both before and after the raid. The
four men who are alleged to have led
the raid were John Holleman, John
Brown, Boyd Conyers and Caroline
de Saussere. The motive for the
shooting, according to Conyers, wa
retaliation for threats said to have
been made by the "crackers" (whites)
that they would have no negro sol
diers at Brownsville,

man said today in reference to the
supreme court decision, which waa
sweeping victory for him and his as
sociate that he had ' always been
confident of suoh an outcome. Per
sonally, he said, ha never had any
objection to answering the questions

The questions which Harrlman ra

the Union Pacific; whether Illinois

pool of which he was a member, with
a view of selling It to the Union Pa
cific; whether Union Pacific direc

the U. P., and how much Santa Fe
stock was owned by the U. P. di

man to answer these questions and its
order waa reversed today by the su

SECRETARY WILSON
GIVES A SUMMARY
During the Twelve Years He Has,
Been at the Head oi the Agri
cultural Department, the
Work Has Made'
Progress.
Washington, Dec. 14. After twelve)
years of service a heed of the de
partment. James Wilson, the secre
tary of agriculture, In his twelfth an
nual report to the president, issued
today, renders a comprehensive ac
count of his stewardship and presents
a review of the progress of agricul
ture In the United Slates during thla
period. Concerning the farm produc
tion of 1808, he says that the fanner
has created wealth by the (billions.
Production has been aoove the aver
age ot recent years with few excep
tions; and, while some prices have .
fallen, others have risen.
Production la 1B08.
The farm value of all farm prod
ucts of 10 reaches the moat extra
ordinary total in ths nation's history
17,778,000,000. This Is about four
times the value of the products of the
mines, including mineral oils and
precious metals. The farmer -con
tributes) 87 per cent of the raw ma
terials used In those manufacturing;

. The gam In value of farm product
in 1908 over 1887 la 2S0,000,000 and
would have been much larger had
not the prices of cotton and hay been
low. The value of products In It. -the
census year, -being taken at 100,
the value for 1003 stands at KG; for
1004, at 1S1; for 1905, at 1S4; for
10, at 143; (or 1907, at 159; and
for 1908 at 185. During the last ten
years the wealth production on the
farms of this country has exceeded
the fabulous sum of $60,000,000,000- .
Corn Greatest of all crops la In- ,
dian corn, whose production this year
is 2.(43,000,000 bushels. The value
of this crop is $1,616,000,000. Thla
wealth, grown out ot the soli In four
months of rain, sunshine and some
droughty Is enough to cancel the in- -terest-bearlng
debt of the United
States and to pay for the Panama, .
canal and fifty battleships. This crop.
Is worth this year nearly as much aa
the great crops of cotton, bay and
wheat combined. Compared with the
averages of the preceding five yare
the quantity Is per cent higher and
the value 43 per cent higher.
Cotton It seems likely that the
cotton crop Is one ot the highest
three ever produced, but with a valua
next to the highest or perhaps more,
although the farm price ot cotton thi
year ks below ths price of last .year .
by more than ona cent.
For the first time In the history ot
this country s agriculture, the value
of the cotton crop, Including seed, has
apparently exceeded the value of tho
hay crop, which has heretofore held
second place.
Hay The greatest hay crop in his
tory has been gathered thla year, 63,
000,000 tons, or 12 per cent above the
average of the preceding five years.
Its price is 33 per ton less than tt
was a year ago. but stilT the farm,
value of the crop Is $631,000,000 or
6 per cent above the five-year aver
age. Wheat Wheat is 1H per cent
above the five-year average In pro
duction and 23 per cent above in
total value. The 660.000.000 bushels
of this crop are estimated to be
worth $620,000,000 to the farmers, or
(6,000,000 more than the most val
uable wheat crop heretofore pro
duced. Oats Although the oat crop suf
fered from drought the value is $311.
000,000 ror 789 000.000 bushels, or It
per cent abov the five-year averagn
value and 9 per cent below the aver
age product.
All t'ereals All cereals aggregate
4,329,000,000 bushels, a total that has
been exceeded three times, but the
value reaches $2,694,000,000, or more
than $30,000,000 above that of 1907.
and exceeds still more the totals of
former years. Compared with the
preceding five years the number of
( bushels is higher by 0.2 per cent aal
the value is higher by 33 per cent.
I Animal Products Although the
farmer gets hardly 20 cents a pound
L for his butter, between I and 4 centa
a 'quart for his milk, and about' 1
cent tor each egg. yet the value of
the farm ''products of the dairy cow la
'getting close of $800.te.00, and the
value tf the eggs and poultry pre-
jduced on he farm Is worth as much,
as the cotton crop, seed Included,- or
.the hay crop, or the wheat crop.
