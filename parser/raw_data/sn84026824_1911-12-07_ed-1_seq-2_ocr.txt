A little love, a little trust,
A soft impulse, a sudden dream?
And life as dry as desert dust
Is fresher than a mountain stream.
?Stopford A. Brooke.
Congress is with us again. This
would be cheering news were it not for
the fact that President Taft is also still
with us.
.?
Up to this time there is no indication
that the progressive Republicans in the
Senate will budge one inch, and we expect
to see the tail continue to wag the
dog.

Things are indeed in desperate condition
in West Virginia when the best material
suggested for the gubernatorial chair
by the G. O. P. is Charlie Swisher and
Dr. Hatfield.
+
n?of a r.-iniirlprahip
1 MC. I\C)JUUIIV.a<l9 aiw at a vu..u?...? disadvantage
in Washington just now.
The only leaders in whom the party has
any confidence are the men who have no
confidence in the party.
ONE of the good things that Congress
should do at this session is to provide for
a parcels post system. The ever-increasing
extortions of the express companies
could be nicely regulated in this way.
Just as was anticipated, there are a
good many snakes in the monetary plan
offered by fornvr Senator Aldrich and
which is to be urged upon Congress.
The thing is all for New York and centralization
of financial power.
Former Senator Scott, of West Virginia,
has resigned as president of the
United States Trust Company of Washington.
He has had much opposition,
and his opponents now having a majority
of the stock of the institution, he resigns
before being voted out. It is said that he
will devote his spare time now to West
Virginia politics.
?
The sentiment is credited to Senator
Watson that every candidate on the Democratic
ticket next year must be a man of
strength and integrity, in whom the people
shall have confidence. He is entirely
right about this, especially as the "reorganized
Republican committee will
likely put up some very weak material.
The greater the contrast, the more certain
Democratic victory.
News comes from Washington that
Hon. Nathan Bay Scott will shortly announce
himself as a Republican candidate
for Governor of West Virginia. No
one will deny that Senator Scott would
be a vast improvement over the smallfry
politicians who are now scrambling
for this honor as the candidates of the
"reorganized" State committee.
The first thing that Congressman Richard
Pearson Hobson did when Congress
assembled on Monday last was to introduce
two joint resolutions amending the
constitution?one prohibiting the manufacture,
sale or importation of all alcoholic
beverages in the United States, and the
second to do away with presidential nominating
conventions and select presidential
candidates by a primary vote.
Both would be mighty good things for
the country.
IN a recent interview President Taft
modestly announces that he is willing to
run for a second term and hopes to receive
a renomination. In the same statement
he admits that if he had it to do over
again he would not call the Payne-Aldrich
tariff act the best act that Congress ever
passed.
It is manly of Mr. Taft to make such an
2cmission, but naturally it will not cause
a restoration of confidence in him. To
have made such a solossal mistake in so
important a matter indicates a weakness
that the people do not like to see in the
chief executive.
ON Tuesday President Taft submitted
his message to Congress. Ittreated upon
one subject only-the subject of trusts?
and the treatment was tame and ineffective.
He suggests a federal incorporation
law.
" - * - it.iiL. n ;j it.
il 11 a curious ining inaunc rresiucni a
entire message should be devoted to trusts,
when only a few years ago the Republican
leaders were insisting very strenuously
that there were no such things as trusts.
After many years of contention, the
War Department has withdrawn the permission
given the owners of the iron ore
mines at the head of New river to turn
the washings of the ore into that stream,
and it is now believed that the New and
the Kanawha will be restored to their
pristine clearness and beauty. There is
great gratification among the people who
live along these streams at the prospect
of having them clarified, and some persons
affect to believe that there may be even a
change in the murky political conditions
that prevail in Kanawha and Fayette
counties.
It takes a real optimist to indulge such
hopes, but if the prohibition amendment
shall carry next year we are quite sure
that a vast improvement will be noted.
One of the greatest sensations of the
year was the announcement last Saturday
that John J. and James B. McNamara
had confessed in Los Angeles, California,
that they were guilty of the dynamite outrages
in that city. In October, 1910, the
i lmes ounaing was acsiroyca oy an explosion
that caused the death of 21 persons,
injury to many others and great
property loss. The work of running
down the miscreants responsible for this
and many other similar crimes was placed
in charge of Wm. J. Burns, a famous detective,
and he wove a web of evidence
around the McNamaras and one or two
others so complete that there was no escape.
Their arrest followed and the
trial was proceeding when last Friday it
was suddenly ended by the confession of
the McNamaras that they were guilty.
John J. McNamara is secretary and treasurer
of the Bridge and Structural Ironworkers'
Union, which has long had a
war with the structural iron manufacturers,
and he is charged with being connected
with no less than 67 dynamite explosions
during the past three years. The
whole country has been shocked by the
admissions of the guilt of these men, and
organized labor has been badly hurt.
The Burning of "Fountain Rock."
A few weeks ago the Baltimore Sun
contained an interesting but somewhat
inaccurate account of the burning of
"Fountain Rock," the Rome of the late
Col. A. R. Boteler, near Shephetfstown,
during the Civil War, by order of General
Hunter. We refrained from republishing
this article at the time because of the inaccuracies,
although it made excellent
reading. In the Sun of Tuesday last we
find this letter, which gives a truthful account
of that unhappy episode:
To the Editor of The Sun?Sir: In
your issue of November 5 there appeared
an interesting account of the burning of
Col. Alexander R. Boteler's house, near
Shepherdstown, W. Va., in July, 1864.
The article is headed "Sang Dixie as Her
Home Burned Over Her Head," and the
story is evidently considered very effective
because of the singing of this famous
song.
May 1 be allowed to make several corrections
which will in no way detract from
the dramatic interest of the story, but will
add to its value as a bit of authentic history?
Colonel Boteler's daughter.Helen Boteler,
now Mrs. Dudley D. Pendleton, did
not sing "Dixie" as her home was burning.
Fascinating and thrilling as the tune
of "Dixie" is to all Southern hearts, there
is little in the words or music that could
appeal to a young girl of deep feeling at
such a tragic moment.
No warning was received at Fountain
Rock of the intended destruction of the
house. Miss Boteler and her widowed
sister were alone, wnn one negro woman
and three little children, when Captain
Martindale presented General Hunter's
order to burn the place.
After recovering from the first shock of
the announcement, the two sisters went
to work to save what they could in the
short time before them. Several soldiers
gave them kindly assistance in this pitiful
task. It was impossible for sympathetic
neighbors to come to their aid in time,
and no "crowd of awed spectators" was
present. In less than 30 minutes the
soldiers' work was done, and soon afterward
they were on their way to Bedford,
the next home on General Hunter's list.
No patriotic bravado or melodramatic
sentimentality marked Helen Boteler's action
that day. Up to the last moment she
was absorbed in the practical business of
saving a little store of necessities and a
few cherished treasures, and when finally
everyone was forced to leave the burning
building, in a sudden uncontrollable impulse
of passionate grief, she rushed back
into the parlor and, touching the keys of
her beloved piano for a last farewell to
her home, the young girl sang these stanzas
of Charlotte Elliott's beautiful hymn:
"My God, my Father, while I stray
Far from my home in Life's rough way.
Oh, teach me from my heart to say,
Thy will be done!
If thou shouldst call me to resign,
What most 1 prize, it ne'er was mine;
I only yield rhee what is Thine;
Thy will be done I"
Surely the truth about this touching incident
of that far-away time is more mov*'
'' -4- " ? I* I thinl/
ingman any iiciiuu. u inusuaito, i.ni.n,
the essential spirit of numberless Southern
women of that wonderful generation?
not fierce defiance and not mere resignation,
but a spirit of brave endeavor till all
that love and labor could do had been
done, and through even the bitterest experience
a simple steadfast trust in One
who judges neither victory nor defeat "by
the outer issue." E. S. P.

FOR YOUR HAIR.
Here Are Facts We Want You to
Prove at Our Risk.
When the roots of the hair are entirely
dead and the pores of the scalp are glazed
over, we do not believe that anything
can restore hair growth.
But, when the hair roots retain any
life, we believe there is nothing that will
so surely promote hair growth as will
Rexall "93" Hair Tonic. To prove that
statement, we promise to promptly re
turn all the money you pay us for Rexall
"93" Hair Tonic, should it not please
you.
Rexall '-93" Hair Tonic destroys the
germs which are usually responsible for
baldness. It penetrates to the roots of
the hair, stimulating and, by promoting
circulation, nourishing them.
Rexall "93" Hair Tonic helps to relieve
scalp irritation, to remove dandruff, to
prevent the hair from falling out, and to
promote an increased growth of hair. It
comes in two sizes, prices 50 cents and
$1.00. Remember, you can obtain it only
at nur ctnr???Thp Rexall Store. Owens
& Miller.
TO THE PUBLIC.
The removal of the Citizens Fire Insurance
Company to Baltimore having
caused an erroneous idea to prevail
amongst some of our patrons that our
firm, or a portion of it, would leave town,
this is to inform the public generally, and
our patrons in particular, that the above
removal will in no way effect our firm,
and that none of the members thereof
will leave the county of Jefferson, and we
will continue business at the "old stand."
Yours truly,
Washington, Alexander & Cooke.

When two of them, taste and smell,

have used it? It is applied directly to the
affected air-passages and begins its healing
work at once. Why not get it to-day ?

NOTES FROM NEARBY.
A mad dog ran amuck in the Boonsboro
neighborhood a few days ago, and
bit four children that were alongthe roadside.
It also bit a number of dogs. .
The heirs of the late Jos. T. Grantham
havesoldtheirfarm west ofCharlesTown,
on the Middleway turnpike, containing
about 235 acres,to Geo. T. Shirley. The
price is said to be about $16,000.
Frankford, the home of Mrs. Thomas
McCormick, near Berryville, was destroyed
by fire on Tuesday, the blaze
having started from sparks on the roof.
Much valuable antique mahogany furniture
was destroyed The loss is $6,000,
with but little insurance.
James Edwards, aged 37 years, son of
Charles Edwards, of Leetown, this county,
met with a terrible accident in Martinsburg
last Thursday. Edwards, a ho
was employed at the Hannis Distillery,
was walking along the railroad tracks,
when an engme struck him and crushed
one of his legs off. He may recover.
James Callahan, a popular B. & O.
freight conductor, formerly of Martinsburg,
was struck by a fast passenger train
at Magnolia last Thursday, and his body
was cut in two. His home was in Brunswick,
where a wife and two children survive
him. He was 55 years old. He
was a cousin of Miss Bina Callahan, of
this place.
The heirs of the late C. W. Henderson
have stopped by injunction the improvements
now being made by the Baltimore
& Ohio Railroad at Hancock Station.
They want $30,000 for the right of way
through their property, and the railroad
officials regard this price as exorbitant.
Perhaps this trouble is the cause of the
B. & O. discontinuing Hancock as a firstclass
station.
The Hagerstown street railway company,
owned by Harrisburg capitalists,
has been sold to Hagerstown and Frederick
men who own the trolley line operating
between Hagerstown and Frederick
and which will build a new line
from Jefferson, Md., to Brunswick. It is
said that power for the operation of these
lines, or a part of them, will be secured
from the electric generating plant at Millville,
this county. A survey for this line
is now oeing made from Millville to
Brunswick.
Albert Huddle, a Norfolk & Western
employee, residing at Shenandoah, Va.,
encountered a wildcat while hunting near
Stokesville, in Rockingham county. He
and his tA-o dogs got the animal into close
quarters, but then the battle wavered.
The dogs, worsted by the ferocious cat,
fell back, and the maddened beast sprang
at Huddle, who had no chance to escape.
Unable to beat off the animal, Huddle
grabbed the cat by a hind leg and slammed
it against a jagged rock. Whirling the
screaming brute around his head he again
banged it against the rock, this time
knocking out its brains and breaking its
neck.
Last Wednesday night officers made a
raid on the place in Martinsburg formerly
occupied by Ki isey B. Creque as a whiskey
saloon, now ostensibly used as a
soft drink establishment, and arrested
Wilbur Thurston and Fred Rankins on
the charge of selling liquor without a license.
The place, which is just across
the street from the court-house, was filled
with a crowd of white and colored loafers.
It is said that pistols were drawn, but the
officers were not frightened and firmly
performed their duty. Fifteen half-pint
bottles of whiskey were found, but Creque
claimed these as his private property.
Creque holds a government license to sell
liquor. The men were held for the action
of the grand jury.
Catarrh Cannot be Cured
with local applications, as they cannot
reach the seat of the disease. Catarrh is
a blood or constitutional disease, and in
order to cure it you must take internal
remedies. Ball's Catarrh Cure is taken
internally, and acts directly on the blood
mucous surfaces. Hall's Catarrh Cure is
not a quack medicine, it was prescribed
by one of the best physicians in thi? country
for years and is a regular prescription.
It is composed of the best tonics known,
combined with the best blood purifiers,
acting directly on the mucous surfaces.
The perfect combination of the two ingredients
is what produces such wondertul
results in curing Catarrh. Send for
