If all historical tales were of equally high
grade they would be less of a weariness
to the soul. Admirable illustrations in color
by Smedley accompany a Bret Harte
"Colonel Starbottle" story. Among the no
ticeable reproductions, in black and white
are those representing a number of stud
ies by Rosa Bonheur. Many of the
sketches and stories have to do with chil
dren, as Is in keeping with the holiday
season. Even Mark Twain has a child for
hi3 chief character in his story of the days
of Cromwell; Bret Harte's "Colonel Star
bottle" concerns himself with the affairs of
a little girl. Sarah Orne Jewett's "Honey
Tree," or, as it would be known in the
"West, "bee tree," was discovered by a boy,
who expected to profit greatly by the hid

fully of "Mother and Child." and E. C.

There is unusual variety in the content
and a remarkable number of notable contri

ner and includes "The Making of a Pilot,"
by Albert White Vorse, an exciting and
apparently true story, wherein the qualities
necessary to the make-up of a pilot are ad
mirably exhibited; "The Turquoise Cup,"
by Arthur Cosslett Smith, an entertaining
tale where the principal characters are
the Lady Nora, a lovely Irish girl, the
Earl of Vauxhall, an Englishman, and
their good friend, the cardinal, long years

"The Last of the Fairy Wands." by Wil

Oliver Horn," by F, Hopkinson Smith, con
tinued from the November number, with

is dramatically descriptive of the scenes
which led to the confushn of Madame Le

HE FELL TO HIS DEATH
T. II. IV ATI? IIS, A TRAVELING SALKS
3IAN, KILLI-: AT LAFAYETTE.
Found Trlth .fck and Iloth Lee
Ilroken on the Cement ewalk
In Front of the Lahr House.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
LAFAYETTE, Ind., Dec. 8.-T. Ti. Wa
ters, representing the N. D. Dodge & Bliss
Shoe Manufacturing Company, of New
buryport, Mass., and whose home is in
Toledo, was killed at 8 o'clock this morn
ing by falling from a third lloor window
of the Lahr House to the cement side
walk on the Fifth-street $dde. No one saw
him fall, but the dead body was found a
moment afterward, with the neck and both
legs broken. He was about forty-eight
years old, was well known to shoe mer
chants here and had been making regular
visits to the city for nearly fifteen years.
There is no way of accounting for the
death. In the room, next the window, was
a sample table four feet wide, and it was
necessary to cross this before he could
fall. Friend3 with whom -he spent the
evening until 10 o'clock say he was not
drinking and that they can imagine no
causa for suicide. At 10:30 he is reported
as having said ho was not feeling well. He
took a milk punch and soon after retired,
but was restless during the night and once
or twice called for a bell boy. The pre
sumption is that, becoming delirious or
seeking more air, he undertook to raise
the window and fell to his death. He has
a sister living In Delta, O., a suburi of
Toledo, and she has been communicated
with. Mr. Waters was a member of tho
Knights Templars, and the order has taken
temporary charge of the remains.

NEW CLUII HOUSE FOR PL'RIll'E.
Fund for Thl Purpose lins Ileen
Started liy the Claas of 1003.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
LAFAYETTE, Ind., Dec. 8. Two of the
greatest needs of Turdue University bid
fair to be supplied in the very near future.
The first, an assembly hall of adequate
size, was recently made possible by Mrs.
Eliza Fowler's magnificent gift of J60.0CO
for thi3 purpose. The second, a clubhouse
for the exclusive use of the members of the
various athletic teams, and which has been
for some time one of the fond dreams of
the "Boiler Makers," will soon become a
reality. The initiative was taken by the
class of 1003 at a meeting held on Friday
evening in the old chapel, when they
pledged themselves to raise-$1.000 to be ap
plied in the erection of the proposed club
house. The other three classes are no less
anxious to see the project carried out and
will heartily takoa hand in raising the
cost of the building, doubtless making gifts
to their alma mater of a similar nature and
purpose.
In this clubhouse the players will live,
enjoying comfortable rooms with all possi
ble modern conveniences and the advantage
of being near the university buildings,
training quarters and the athletic field. It
is proposed to set a good training table in
the same building for the players. In
short, every effort is to be made to afford
Purdue teams of the future the best of
advantages and care.

GRAIN FOR THE HUNGRY
OVER SIXTEEN MILLION POODS PUIt
C1IASCÜ FOR STARVING RUSSIANS.
Conditions In the Famine Districts
Situation Worse tlinn Govern
mental Reports Indicate.
Correspondence of the Associated Tress.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 22. The min
istry of tho interior yesterday issued an
other statement about the famine. Five
and a half million poods of winter grain
and three millions of summer grain has
been purchased and forwarded to the needy
districts. The total grain purchases are
given as exceeding sixteen million poods,
for which 10,000,000 roubles has been ex
pended. The entire famine fund so far
dispensable is 14.213.25S roubles. The origi
nal estimates of grain to relieve the fam
ine districts are now found to be excessive,
and they have consequently been reduced
in a number of cases. Conditions in Asiatic
Russia are still bad, and much relief will
be sent there. Petitions for official procla
mation of famine from Asiatic Russia were
received from twenty-seven districts and
were granted in twenty-two.
Private reports which have appeared in
the press from time to time are not nearly
as optimistic as the governmental. Hun
ger and disease have been reported much
more prevalent than the ministry of the
interior admits. In addition to direct help
for the famine districts, indirect help has
been granted in several forms. Working
men traveling to public works will enjoy
the moderate emigrant rate, and materials
needed for the works, as well as grain,
will be distributed at greatly reduced
tariffs.
The Emperor ha3 just sanctioned the
beginning of preliminary work on the two
great railroads the Petersburg-Viatka and
the Rologoye-Sledlltz. The latter is a strat
egic road leading to the western frontier.
Many workmen from the famine districts
will find employment in clearing the right
of way of these roads.
