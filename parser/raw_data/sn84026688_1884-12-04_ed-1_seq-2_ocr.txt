Washington Letter.
(FUOM Ouil UeOUI.AU CoKKESroNDKNT.)
Dec. 1, 1884.
The National flag was run up to-day
at noon on both the House and Senaie
ends of the Capitol. r l hero was the
usual opening day crowd at the Capi
tol, and a fair attendance of Sencatora
and Representatives. Many, however,
failed to answer to their names at roll
call, but each arriving train is bring
ing them in.
Long before the noon hour members
and Senators gathered in their respect
ive halls, exchanged greetings and con
gratulations until the gavel called (hem
to order. Ail could not be congratu
lated, however, for all were not of th?
re-elect.
Visitors crowded the galleries, and
looked down with much interest on the
familiar faces of Isgislators, and tried
to read in them the triumphs or de
feats of the summer campaign. The
"gallery gods ’ are critical, if not pro
found, and they observed the speaker
of the House had a healthier glow in
his impuitnrable tariff for revenue
face; that Mr. Dorsheimer’s enormous
shadow had not grown loss; that the
waggish Mr. Hurr had a “life-is-uot
worth-living" expression ; that Mr.
Randall had a far-off cabinct-portfolio
guze ; ami that the senior Senator from
Kansas was us faultlessly clothed as
usual’.
The members and Senators from the
solid sunny South have a complacency
ami happiness of expression that pass
eth understanding. Northern and
Western Democrats are cheerful, but
the Southern wing is beatific. On
the Republican side of the House de
pressioii is plain! / visible, and some
faces tell that “Their star has gone
down in the darkness of night, And
hope from their bosom has fled.”
Barring Sundays and the usual holi
day recess, but seventy days of work
ing life remain to the forty-eighth
Congress—a brief period, indeed, when
it is remembered that most of the work
begun last session remains unfinished,
and that many important measures
winch have been maturely considered
in one of the two houses await the ac
tion of the co-ordinate branch.
Situated as Congress is, there can be
no partisan legislation, nor can there
be any very sweeping reforms effected
in the appropriation hills; but then*
will be long debates over numerous
provisions in most of these bills, and it
is probable that they will occupy much
more than half the days of the session.
A vigorous effort will also he made
by the friends of the Congressional Li
brary bill to secure its passage by the
House in substantially the same shape
in which it came from the Senate. It is
legislation of the most meritorious
character ; and in the interest not only
ofa valuable property, which is rapid
ly augmenting in value, hut of the na
tional honor and sound public policy,
the wants of the Library should be
promptly and permanently provided
for.
The Hotel corridors are filled with
members of Congress and prominent
gentlemen from all parts of the coun
try. Many distinguished persons not
in active political or official life, will be
here this winter. There will he a mark
ed increase in the better Southern ele
ment. Mr. Blaine will live in ex-Sec
retary Windom’s house on Scott Circle.
It is conjectured by some, that the fam
ily will open a social headquarters
there, and entertain largely. Thus
there will bo three factions in Wash
ington society this winter —the powers
that bo, the powers that are going to
be, and the powers that only failed to
be by an almost inappreciable plural
ity. Between the first two, the mdst
friendly relations may exist, but be
tween the friends of President Arthur
ami Mr. Blaine there can he no more
than a ceremonious interchange of ci
vilities, if that.

* igh, and is as sharp as a nioder- t
itely dull needle at its apex. There are s
several reasons why this particular i
metal was used. To begin with, it is <
a good lightning conductor and will i
serve as the top of the lightning rod ; I
then it does not tarnish but will always 1
remain bright. It has much the same
appearance as silver. j

of America, says ttiat while a passenger from I
New York on board a ship going around Capo
Horn, in tho early days ot emigration to Cal
ifornia, ho learned that one of the otlicers of
the vessel had cured himself, during the voy
age, of an obstinate disease by the use of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
Since then Mr. Lkland has recommended
AVER'S Sarsaparilla in many similar I
cases, and he has never yet heard of its fail- )
Ure to elfect a radical cure.
Sdiiio years ago one of Mr. T.eland's farm
laborers bruised his leg. lining to the had
state of his blood, an ugly scrofulous swelling
or lump appeared on the injured limit. Hor
rible itching of the skin, with burning ami
darting pains through the lump, made life
almost intolerable. Tho leg became enor
mously enlarged, and running ulcers formed,
discharging great quantities of extremely
Olfensi vo matter. No treatment was of any I
avail until tho man, by Mr. I.elanu’s direc
tion, was supplied with AVER'S Saiisapa
’iiilla, which allayed the pain and irritation,
healed the sores, removed tho swelling, and
completely restored the limb to use.
Mr. Lelaud has personally used
1 Ayers Sarsaparilla
