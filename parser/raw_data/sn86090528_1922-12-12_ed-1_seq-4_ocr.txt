AMERICANISM CREED,
"I Ldieve in the United States of America, and the prin
ciples of freedom, justice, equality and humanity upon which it
was founded and for which American patriots have given their
lives and fortunes.
" "1 believe it is my duty towards my country to love it ; to
support its constitution; to obey its lawi; Jo respect hi flag;
nnd to defend it against all enemies."
KNOW YOUR NE'CHBORS.
Mr. K. li. Waitc, secretary of the Shawnee Hoard of Com
iiick'c, has been asking more pertinent questions. Here is his
latest :
Did you ever stop ,to think?
Tliat a "Know Your Neighbor" movement should be started
in snuie cities.
'lint in smaller cities and towns such a movement is not
necessary, because in such towns it is a customary thing for fam
ilies to know each other.
That it would be interesting for all persons to check up
today aud see how many families they know in the block in
'which they live.
Th.'t in some instances some people do not know all the
people living in their own boarding house, let alone knowing the
people living next door.
That if such a cheek were made and if neighbors would make
it a point to meet each other and be neighborly, there would be
a great influence in the spirit of good will in' the community and
a greater co-operation for the common good.
o
T . .RESfECTFOR.LAW.. . v
"' Every citizen will do well to ponder the following passage
from President Harding's annual message to congress:
"There is a call to make the alien respect our institutions while
he accepts our hospitality. More, there is a demand
for every living being in the United States to respect and abide
by the laws of the Republic. - 1
"Let men who are lessening the moral fiber of the Republic,
through easy contempt of the prohibition law, because they think
it restricts' their personal liberty, remember that they set the
example and breed a contempt for law which will ultimately
dest oy the Republic." ,
t o
JOB FOR A STATESMAN,
Lloyd George, who has his moments of vision, said in a recent
speech :
"The supreme task of statesmanship at this hour is the paci
fication of nations so that the p :oplc shall have leisure to devote
themselves to the peaceful vocations of life, to fill the depleted
reservoirs from which we all draw."
So say we all of us. Hut where is the statesman equal to
Jhat task? ( Or where, is the nation ready to support him, when
hc submits his peace-making program which will necessarily
ignore old prejudices and wrongs and put the soft pedal on
narrow and short-sighted nationalism?
o
Whatever one may think about the message which Clemen
ttVnu has brought to America, it is difficult to understand how
anybody cati withhold admiral ion from him as a man. That a
man past eighty years of ag-: should undertake such a task as
"The Tiger" assigned to himself is amazing in itself. His physical
vitality and mental energy mark him as a man the like of which
the world has seldom seen. Long before they reach his age,
most men have lost the fighting spirit and are ready to let the
world go as it will, but not so with Clemenceau. Possibly it is
because he has been so preoccupied with the things that have
.constituted his life's interest that he has apparently, lost sight
of time and is still young and vigorous despite Jhe tale which
the calendar tells. His one absorbing passion is France, and if
jiis mission to America should have no other effect, the example
which he affords should serve as an inspiration to the loftiest
patriotism.
f ' ; o
t The road to normalcy presents perils for publishers as well
as to practically all other lines of business and industry. One of
the large daily newspapers at Amarillo, Texas, was sold under
the sheriff's hammer last week. Details were not disclosed by the
press dispatch, but the trouble was probably clue to over-expansion
fhiring the period when the peak of prosperity prevailed." In many
instances, publishers,. Jike- other business men, lost their heads
during those exciting days, existing plants being expanded and
new ones established, which "were far in excess of requirements
of the variousi fields after the business slump set in. As a conse
quence, during the last two years there have been many failures,
while in a number of cases consolidations have been effected.
These movements have been inevitable in the process of readjust
ment. With the single exception of paper, which still sells at
pore than double the pre-war price, there has been jio reduction
m the cost of producing newspapers, and this condition, coupled
with a largely reduced volume of business, has caused difficulties
'jvhich have taxed the resources and ingenuity of publishers, every
where. ,' :' ,. . i
; That Grady county is regarded as the most promising of all
the prospective new oil fields now, is the opinion expressed by the
.Oil editor of the Daily Oklahoman, in a news article which was
printed last Sunday. In addition to the remarkable development
that has taken place in the gas field which was opened when the
h'g Nichlos No. 1 was brought in last July, the leasing by large
$il companies in the southeastern part of the county is now
Attracting much attention. The general opinion among oil men
jow seems to be that Grady county is a "good bet." . 1
