The President's Message
There seems Jo i ua tliveirnity of opin-
ion among candid readers of unbiased
'minds as t the. meritorious and outsDo-
ken character of President Lincoln's late
'Annual Message. While there are a
. fcy percriticai fault-finders who ex
. . tibit more rancorous partiinn zeal than
patriotic wisdom in their loose criticism,
tne !rea$ mass are satisfied with its out
poken, manly, temperate and humane
i.j tone. Unlike similar documents from
' Mr. Lincoln's more immediate predeces-
ors, his message grasps the live issues of
the day with a rigor and willingness that
; plainly indicates a determination to bold-
ly meet every responsibility involved in his
position. The President proclaims to the
.nation end the civilized world, that the
instigating cause of the fierce intestine
strife that now divides and embroils the
nation, is Slavery. This fact, patent to
1 y unprejudiced, patriotic mind, calls
loudly for a remedy that shall destroy the
pestilential virus of that demon power
Vhich in the insanity of its blind rage
: presumed to defy and ruin the. nation
i it. could not rule in a condition of base
subserviency. It is certainly a matter
fr congratulation to realize . that a man
occupies the Presidential chair who does
no act in awe of the Slave Power that for
years has ruled the councils of this Na
tion. He does not regard Slavery as ei
.ther necessary or useful institution,. Of
course the pro-slavery Democracy, who

.... system that fosters robbery, piracy, con
cubinage and erery eo-relatlve lustful in--decency,
together with the lash and man-
'acles, ore horrified at the audacity of Pres
" ent Ijncoln's propositions to abolish an
institution so consonant with all their
unhallowed sympathies and sentiments.

be deterred from pressing this most ini-

This is the gigantic work that confronts
the Secretary, and to this he bends all the
powers of his intellect and experience. He
first reviews the measures already adopt-
ed.oryet under legislative consideration, to
furnish means to the Treasury, viz : the
seferal acts imposing duties on imports.
the excise law, the acta authorizing the
issue of United States notes and the"five
twepty loan," the two act aptborixing
the issue of certificates of debt, and the
purchase of coin, and the act authorising
payment in stamp. We can only glance
at this most interesting and lucid review
fa tba course of it Mr. Chase remarks
that the neenseitj of the war required a
system by which he could furnish fa the
military departments $00,000)00 every
sixty days, and that he deemed the plan
of raising this sum by selling the loans of
the Government at whatever sacrifice
might he demanded, as incompatible with
his ideas of publio duty. The loans
would also have to be exchanged for bank
funds, and securities negociated in that
currency would nave oeen nut an ex.
change of Government inttreM-heanng bonds
for debts of private corporations hearing
no interest. Besides this. It would bar re
sulted in a great expansion of bank note
currency. It was tor tins reason lie pre
ferred the issue of JJnited States notes-
While couaiilsring what may bo expect
ed from existing laws to July 1st, 18C3
and how fhe balance of disbursements
for that year and the year 1864 are to be
provided for, the Secretary incidentally
touches upon the rise in gold, which he
traces to speculation, lie exhibits the to
tal amount of circulation in November.
1861, and November. 1S62 ; argues that
the increase in the volume of circulation
is legitimately demanded by the changed
condition of the country ; shows that the
Uuited fttates notes are not redundant in
the circulation ; thai if there is a redund
ant circulation it is of the bank currency;
that there was no public necessity for this
expansion of the currency : that there
vat a necessity for the issue of notes on
the part of the Government; that from
all these considerations the path of wis
dom and duty is clear, and he therefore
adheres to his recommendation in favor of
the United States notes, and of the re
duction of he bank note circulation by
levying as mall tax thereon- To avoid
the temptations and dangers of extreme
inflation of the National currency under
the existing system, he recommends the
passage of a general law authorizing the
organization of banking associations. If
this plan should be adopted persons hav.
ing real capitol can invest suchpart of it,
not less than a fixed minimum, in United
States bonds, and having deposited these
bonds with the proper officer, can receive
S. notes, to be employed in discounts
and exchange, a this way every dollar
circulation would represent real capi
tal actually invested m National stock.
and the total amounts issued eould always
easily ascertained from the books of
the Treasury. This plan is not unlike
the present organization of the State
Bank of Ohio and its branches.
:

Chase shows how it will furnish the peo

heavy fire of artillery and infantry in front
of the first line of works where Generals
Sumner and Hooker were engaged yes

[Extract from the Toledo Globe.]
"Ono thing, we trust, is certain Brit
ain will have nought to do with the in
trigues of the Irem-h despot. e know
nothing too bad for Louis Xapoleon to do:
we trust that England's fair fame, as a
nation which loves freedom and hates
slavery, will never be sullied by an act
which would rivet forever the tetters ti
the Southern bondman now happily fall
ing from his limbs. The idea that the
European powers are justified in going
round the world intericrmg m every
man's quarrel, dictating what shall be
the boundaries of one country, and when
war shall cease or go on iu another, is a
practical absurdity which it is time to
abandon. If, at the time when Delhi was
besieged and the fate of Britain s Indian
empire, for the moment, hung in me
balance, the United Mates liau asKcu
France to offer a joint meditation ber
tween' the Queen of England and the
King of Delhi, and declared that it did
not see anv good result to be gained from
carrying on the struggle, how would that
have sounded in liritisli ears. 1 he an
swer would have been short and sharp
one. The nouuiern revolutionists are
doubtless more powerful than tho Indian
mutineers, but there is not other diner-
ence, and the additional power only caus
es suspicion that the suggested mediation
is not quite disinterested. hat wouiu
Lou-s Napoleon say, if the United States
were at this moment to offer their media
tion between France and Mexico?
Would he not tell the President very
SDeedilv to mind his own business? Nei
ther i ranee not England are in a position
to talk about the horrors of bloodshed
and the interruption" to' trade caused by
war. To protect lurkev thev entered
into a bloody and expensive war, caused
serious interruption to tho commerce of
the world. It will not surely be alleged
that the Northern States have less reason
for going to war with the South than had
the Western ' powers for sustaining the
sick man with their arms? there is not
vestige of a foundation for European in
terferenee In the. American quarrel. That
the "cotton supply has been stopped is a
good reason for Britian looking about her
for other sources of supply, and lor those,
more particularly, which will not be lia
ble, as the result of shivery, to suddf n
convulsions. But it atlords no reason lor
going to war with the Northern States.
Instead of desiring to stop the work hall
way, the people of Britain should rejoice
that they have passed through half the
ordeal necessary to undergo ere they can
be free from their subservience to slave
labor, and should bear the rest of the
burden with alacrity.
The American Government asks to be
alone. The British Government has
acknowledged the justice and propriety
the demand by the proclamation of
neutrality. No new circumstances have
since that event arisen to change the po
sition, and there can be no reasonable
doubt that the attitude which the Imperi
al authorities have deliberately chosen,
will be maintained to the -end of the
struggle."

CONGRESSIONAL.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11. SENATE.
A message was received from the Presi
dent recommending a vote of thanks to
Lieut. Geore W. Morris for the deterra-
T V . f . . i r 1 T' , ,
of the sloopof-war Cumberland,
against the rebel iron-clad Merrimac; al-
so recommending a vote of thanks to
Lieut. George L. Aordeu, for the skill
gallantry exhibited by him in the
between the Monitor and the rebel
steamer Merrimac. Referred to Naval
Com nit tee.
The resolution relative to the arbitrary
urrests of certain citizens of Delaware was
up.
Mr. Morrill contended that the resolu-
us it now stood was not a mere reso-
of inquiry, but a charge against the
Government, and an iudictment against
President Lincoln, and be (Morrill) should
vote for no such resolution. He claimed
that iu this state of war and rebellion
with, the land full of traitors and spies,
the CoiDIUunder-lIl-Chief has the right to
arrest such men. .No one, not even the
senator from Delaware, Saulsbury,
has
claimed that these meu were loyal.
There had been many arrests made, and
the proper presumption is that the Presi
dent his lx-en arresting guilty. men and
simply doing his duty. He (Lincoln!
ought to tlo it. It will not do to pretend
Lth.it a whole State and all its people are
ioyai una u is Known that tne Alate t
Kentucky has been a ne&t of traitors.
Three, out of every four of the able-bodied
men of Kentucky have gone to rebeldom,
nnd nobody is left there but old women,
yet tho Senator from Kentucky (Powell)
asks for commibs-eration for these men.
That Senator (Powel) had denounced the
Government from the beginning the same
as his colleague who followed the logical
result of reasoning, and had gone into the
rebel army ; but not a word does that
Senator-Powell) offer against the rebels,
and rejoices over the recent elections, and
says the lion-hearted Democracy are re
nukmg this Administration. Well, every
rebel rejoices in the sauie way. ---It
supposed there will be a peace party
the North that will force the Uovernruen
into an inglorious pauce, aud that party
encouraged Jell. Davis and foreign cou
tries intervention. There ought to be
some proof that these men were loya!
Mr. Morrill contended that there was
no ground tor complaint ; that men were
arrested on suspicion, and men were
wavs arrested on suspicion of crime.
Mr. Wright moved to amend the reso
lution so as to make the call upon the
President instead of the Secretary ol ar.
Mr. u right said he knew nil man was
permitted to live in the South who had
anv sympathy with the north, lie would
like to see some of the spirit that was
shown by Stonewall Jackson when
found 47 of his men skedaddling from
the battle. He marched them in front of
the regiment and had every man of them
shot. Instead of this we have proposi
tions for conventions, 4c, lie lilr. W.

President ; he would have the power of
the Government felt by every traitor.
North or South.
Mr. Bayard argued at some length to
show the atl.ur of the State of Kentucky
had nothing whatever to. do with the
State of Delaware, and that true loyalty to
the country did not imply loyalty to any
single individual. If this is a free coun-
tiy the people in it certainly have a right
to inquire into the acts of tho rresident
Mr. Powell said he had said the Presi
dent hud violated the Constitution, an
he was ready to prove it
He defied the Senator from Maine or
any other Senator on . this floor, to the
lists on this question. He denied that
three out of four of the people of the
State were In the rebel army; three-
fourths of the people of that State were
not in arms at all, and he believed that
there were more men in the Union than
in the Rebel army
He (Powell) wanted to indulge in no
personalities with any Senator here, as
there was a way to settle personal matters
elsewhere. He wanted the Senators to
meet bis arguments fairly. He did not
believe this Union could ever be restored
by force of arms ; therefore he had op
posed the war, and should continue to op
pose it. He was in favor of the Conven
tion projiosed by his colleague, Davis.

Lincoln had violated the Constitution in
enlarging the regular army, in suspen

Resolved, By the House of Representa
tives, the Senate concurring, that the
Proclamation of the President of the 22d
of November, 1802, is not warranted by
the Constitution.
Itesolced, That the notice cf emancipa
tion, as indicated in the proclamation.
not calculated to hasten the restoration of
peace, is not well chosen as a war meas
ure, and is an assumption of power dan
gerous to the rights of citizens and the
perpetuity of a free government.
Mr. Lovejoy moved to lay the resolu
tion on the table,
Carried 04 against 4a.
The House then went into Committee
the Whole on the President's Message.
Mr. Hutching spoke at length, taking
for a text that freedom and slavery were
incompatible beyond hope of reoncilia-
tion and compromise.
Mr. Menzies, replying, said be was in
the habit of regarding the enemies of the
Proclamation as the friends of the Consti
tution. He understood the gentlemen
from Ohio (Mr. HutchinsV to be opposed
the Union as it was. No doubt the rea
sons assigned by him for the recent de
feats of the Kepublicans were satisfactory
