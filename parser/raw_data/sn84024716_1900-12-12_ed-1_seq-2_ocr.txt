GOOD CITIZENSHIP,
Tbe oeoeaenry qualifi ations for gocd
citizenship aro civic virtuo and intflii

that only good citizens should partici?
pate iu government. The State has
gon3 so far in this direction ae to say
persons guilty of cri no shall not par?
ticipate ia tba election of our rulers,
a id eonvietion of cline is the evidence
that disqualifies them. Ibis st itu te
was intended Co prevent tho visions
from ruling tho State and by common
consent it is a v ise prevision of law
Bribery fa one of those infamous
clim's tbat disqualifies, and yet the
bribers and the bribed vote and con
(!???' the elections and tho nation. They
do it because it ia scent ofiVnse an V

wroug withoat a renedy, unles? the
corrupt ure reached, Dotage individuals,
but as a c'as--. That elis? consists,
not exclusively, but for the moist part,
of tl s ignorant ?people who lnve not
taken inteies*. enough in themselves to
karn of the advantages and bemficence
of good govi-rnoieut, and value tLe
elective franchise onl) for the revenue

This i*lass of people are a m<nacj to
society, for the protection of which
government was instituted, and are
more dangerous because more numer?
ous than those convicted of infamous
crimes and under the present law de?
nied the right to vote.
There is no excuse for this ignorance
an I its teqaenoe in Virginia, wheie
toe public cchools are open to alli
children and have been for a gontra

witdom should add ignorance to that
of c.ime as a disqualification for suff

THE /'L'ES I DENT'S MESSAGE.
The President's messago was long as
usual, too long to be generally read
when i- is known to contain nothing
not already known. It discloses noth?
ing as to the future of Cuba, Poi tc
Rico and tbo Philippines, suying in
reference to the latter that in the ab?
sence of a contrary expression of the
will of C(.n?ress he has used authority
to ivr-bold the sovereignty of theUnited
Siate-. This is a p'ain evasi n of the
Constitution, that prohibits the Presi?
dent from rrosecutrag wars without
the sanction ot Congress, which thc
Prtbi lent has been doing, and is bu*
thinly veiled absolutism.
The President evidently feels Ihat
the recent election wa3 an endorse?
ment cf his anirinistration and tbat he
is fully authorized to advocate and
approve cf all the wild schemes of
plunder and power his advisers are
credited with fostering.
The great remedy cf the day fa un
questi nably Pain Killer, for the iu
staut relief of all burns, scalds, bruises,

bowels as well as in sudden attacks of
cholera morbus. No family should

Beauty
The most beautiful thing in
the world is thc baby, all
dimples and joy. The most
pitiful thing is that same bair..
thin and in pain. And the
mother does not know that r.
little fat makes all thc differ?
ence.
Dimples and joy have gone,
and left hollows and fear; thc
fat, that was comfort and
color and curve-all but pity
and love-is gone.
Thc little one gets no fat
from her food. There is some?
thing wrong; it is either her food
or food-mill, She has had no
fat for weeks; is living on what
she had stored in that plump
little body of hers; and that is
gone. She is starving for fat;
it is death, bc quick!
Scott's Emulsion of Cod
Liver Oil is the fat she can
take; it will save her.

it, take no other.

A FRAUD ON ITS FACE.
[Hoekingham Register.]
Some of cur State exchanges aie
printing a fae simile of the ballot pro?
vided for the late election by the
electoral board of Scott county, in this
State, It is not easily described to a
persoD untamiJiar with tens* used in
tire prin ing office, but it is sufficient
to stale, that ko jumbled and mixed up
were the names of the candidates for
President and vice-President and their
respective electois?their was such an
absenco of captions* and paragraphs?
tbat probably not five mon in one han?
dre I, of full average intelligence, could
maik the ballot with any assurance
that the marking indicated, within the
legal requirement, how they desired to
vote Furthar than that, we do not
believe that any man. no matter how
keen of comprehension or adept rn the
use of tho pencil, coiild at the first at
I empt mark it correctly within the time
allowed by law.
Not to mince words, we belier that
thii pa ticnlar ballot was designoJly
arranged ro mystify and mi-lead the
voter. It wa- frau du ont in it*, pur?
pose and fraudulent on its face, and
th ) electoral b; nrd which directed the
printing and the eounty judge who
assisted in the stamping of such a
ballot were guilty cf a fraudulent set.
This may be a tt.ong statement, but it
is the plain, unvarn shed truth.
Tne Register is a Democratic news
piper?a Democratic ? rga?*, if you
choose?and its record for party ser?
vice, its loyalty to Democratic princi?
ples and Democratic candieates upon
all occasions, gives it the right tn pro?
test n the namo of the Democratic
p .rty against juat such methods as aro
reflected by this Scott county ballot.
The plea may bo that this expedient
was resorted to in behalf of party
success Such an excuse is as bad as
tue offense itself. We do not believe
that success by fraud is better fer any
party or for any man tban honorable
defeat. We do not believe that the
end justifies the means any more in
pc lit ies than in business* or in religion.
A temporary advantage to be attained
cannot compensate fer an indelible
btaiu of dishonor, leaving out of the
question the ignominy of a delayed but
inevitable day of reckoning.
It is high time for Democrats to
disclaim and doncunce official cor
inption such as is disclosed by tbis
Scott county performance. It is a
plain question of right and wrong and
no political party can aflord to condone,
much less endorse, v bat is clearly im?
moral. But even viewed from ihe
standpoint of expediency, the continued
practice of fraud must in time react
abko upon its perpetrators and its
beneficiaries, and no political organi?
zation therefore can afford to endorse
coiruption?even as a matter of policy,
lt is not only right to bo honest, but
it pa)s in the end.
Tue Domocraiic people of Virginia
are honest and the Democratic organ?
ization, as a whole, is an honest organ?
ization. It will be a good tbing, and
the time has now arrivid for it, wheii
dishonest methods shall be denounced
and dishonest men retire fro.n official
positions in which they bring reproach
alike upon their party and upon the
fair name of tbe Commonwealth.

CHRISTMAS SHOPPING.
The spirit of Christmas has already
infused itself into the people. Every?
body seema to be in a good humor,
lhere was never a more temptiug dis?
play of holiday good*. Indeod, the
els- ol goods gen* lilly displayed at
tin hob* av lesson as suitable' tor
Christmas gifn seems to be growing
in riobne-M snd beauty each ytur, and
t e only thing that puzzles the shopper
who ii well ptovided witb cash ll to
noske a choice amoi-g po many tempting
tL:i! ?, One thing to be avoided in
tue 1 BSutiful custom of making Christ?
in ia j risen s is tne spirit of coram?-r
oi;tli-m, tbe spirit ol exchange, thc
len<.ency to value gifts according to
t'-eii Ca st and richness. That is not
tl: spirit of Christmas nor of Christmas
giv'ng And, above all other thiDgs,
Ut the Christmas shopping include
those tl.ings w.iich will make the chil
.ti on happy. It is chiefly a children's
festival, and those families which are
so unfortunate as not to include young
children should increase their own
pleasure in Christmas Day by buying
a metling to make children in somo
othei family happy.
Some things it will be well for the
shoppe) b before making their rounds of
thc stoics to consider. It will be well
to l emembi: r that this is a most trying
time to tie patient cleiks behind tue
counter, and they should be saved
fi om all needless work, from unneces
tsry *-,exation and from unjust com?
plaint. They have at this season to
lemail) cn their feet long, weaiy hours,
ind a smile ot a pleasant wold from
shoppers will do much to relieve the
(iain cf what is to them a very ex?
hausting season.
Another point for the cosiderate
Christ maa shoppers to consider well
befoie they start in is what they want
to 1 uv. It is exceedingly tryiug to
both I ujer and teller for people to be
wan ering aimlessly from st re to
store, knowing that they want some
tln-'g, but without any definite idea of
what it is.
1'. rise the adveitising columns of

porters to selection, make up your
