YESTERDAY'S WORK,
A good many Republicans when they read
the election returns this morning will gay to
themselves, "If I had done my doty the re
sult wonld have been different." . It was a
bad day for Republican voters, and they
didn't get oat as they onght to. The Demo
crats not only got out, bat "got together''
enough to win, although there was serious
dieafieotion in their ranks. Mr. Reynolds
has secured his vindication, though not by a
majority large enough to Muse either his
heart or hia bead to "swell with pride." Mr.
Thomas Heenan is also all right. -
The result is rather discouraging, bat it is
possible, not to say probable, that the mis
takes which hove made Mr. Reynolds' major
ity so small will not be repeated by him. He
has certainly now every inducement to attend
to business and help give the town good gov
ernment. The voting for ward representatives did
not result just as might have been wished,
bat some good men have been elected, and
the court of common conncil will not be any
weaker than it has been, to pat it mildly.
Christmas is coming and all who are disap
pointed now can be merry then.
THE MESSAGE.
The Presidents of this country write very
long messages. President Harrison is no ex
ception, and there is much in his message
that will oommand attention. After consid
ering foreign affairs, he comes to the enbjeot
of the treasury surplus. He does not believe
in having it so large as it has been. He rec
ommends an Immediate revision of the tariff.
He suggests that the duties should be equal
ized, and certain articles which we do not
produce might be admitted free; bat that the
tariff should be amended and revised with a
steady eye to the principle of protection for
Amerloan industries and American labor.
Concerning silver coinage he says: "Any
safe legislation npon this subject mast secure
the equality of the two coins (gold and sil
ver) in their oommoroial uses." And he ex
pect, to oommunicate farther with Congress
apon thla spatter. . ,-.
He favors an elaborate system or ooaat de
fenses. The assault made npon Jadge Field,
he thinks.suggesig questions which are worthy
the attention of Congress. He would recom
mend that more definite provision be made
by law not only for the proteotion of federal
officers, bat for fall trial of sash cases In the
United States conrts. He would also more
folly proteot those who may be called as
witnesses In the conrts of the United States.
He gives the trusts a whack which will
pleaseaall those who have been hart by them.
He saS they are dangerous conspirlcies
agalnat the pnblio good and shonld be made
the subject of prohibitory and even penal
legislation. He favors the enaotment of a
national bankrupt law. He wonld have the
old soldiers treated goneronsly. He takes
notice of the complaint of the railroad brake-
men, and declares that "It is a reproach
to onr civilization that any class of Ameri
can workmen should. In the pursuit of a
necessary and useful vocation, be subjected
to a peril of life and limb as great aa that
of a soldier in time of war." He speaks a
good word for the world's fair. He deolares
himself a civil service reformer. He thinks
the general government shonld aid in .the
education of the people. Concerning the
right or the negro to vote as he pleases he
says: "I earnestly invoke the attention of
Congress to the consideration of snoh mesa
area within its well defined constitutional
powers as will secure to all onr people a free
exercise of the right of suffrage and every
other olvil right nnder the constitution and
aws of the United States." And he reoonv
mends that appropriations be made for ocean
mail service.
The message will make a good impression,
It shows tbat the President has made a care
ful study of the oondltion of the ooantry.
KOITOIIUL NOTES.
The Amerloan Bible society has within the
last seventy-two yeara sent oat nearly fifty
million copies of the Bible. And yet New
Haven remains a Democratic town.
Habitual criminals in Illinois are going to
have thioge made unpleasant for them. Un
der a new law two men found gnilty of rob
bery, it being tholr third conviction for the
same offense, have last been sentenoed to
"imprisonment in the penitentiary for the
term of their natural lives." . -
The consumption of horse flesh in Berlin is
increasing. Last month the Berllners ate
816 horses, against 610 in Ootober. For
varlons reasons, however,the working people
in the Prussian oapltal do not eat so muoh
horse as the poorer olaees of other German
oities. Eonigaberg, for iostanoe, with about
the same population as Rochester, consumed
840 horses last month.
Florida will soon be the greatest lemon
growing country in the world. Lemons
weighing pound eaoh are common In
Florida, and along the banks of the Calooa
ahatohie there is a single tree whioh bears
5,000 lemons, many of whioh weigh a pound
each. Bat, except for show, such large lem
one are of little value, aa they are coarse
grained and pulpy. The best lemons are
grown on poor soil, and for that reason they
are a very profitable crop,- This country
consumes more lemons every year than all
other countries combined, and the consump
tion is constantly increasing. ' ... "
Some interesting figures relating to the
finances of the Paris exposition have been
made public. The gross expenses, which had
been estimated at $8,600,000, were aotnally
$3,300,000. The receipts from the Credit
Fonoier guarantee fund were $4,800,000;
from sale of privileges, $400,000; from sales
of materials for oonstruotlon (estimated),
$300,000; from. State subsidy, $3,600,000;
Paris municipal subsidy, $1,400,000. The
tntal ranatnta fharafnra war. 19 000.000.
I'Deduotlng from this sum the expenses, $8,-
oyv.wu, mere is a remaining surplus or
$1,600,000, whioh will be banded over to th
national treasury, fchich had guaranteed to
make good the deficit if there shonld be any.
Jonathan Watson of Titusville, Pennsylva
nia, has given spiritualism set-back. Some
years ago Watson was an owner of several
oil wells and was worth a million dollars.
He married a spirit medium, and began to

I believe, says ex-President Hayes, refer
ring to the Brazilian revolution, "that Dom
Pedro is in heart a republican and folly in
favor of republican institutions, and that the
present change in the political situation in
his country ia not at all distasteful to him.
I well recall that at the Centennial celebra
tion in Philadelphia in 1876 1 sat next to the
Emperor of Brasil. Juet before Mr. Evarts
began his speech I was surprised to see Dom
Pedro draw from bis pocket a well worn,
well creased copy of the American Declara
tion of Independence, a faosimile of the
original, with the written interlineations and
corrections. Said he, turning to me, 'That
was given to me by au Amerlean friend over
ten years ago, and I've had it as a constant
companion ever since. It's a grand, good
document. I've made it a close study.'
While the Declaration of Independence was
being read from the orator's stand the Bra
zilian Emperor, with bowed head, and eyes
fixed intently on the well worn document
before him, followed the reading word for
word. The reading concluded, the venerable
Emperor, with bowed head, still kept his
eyes on the last words of the document be
fore him; then looking up, eyes dimmed and
voice betraying emotion, he remarked, 'A
wonderful document; a wonderful document 1'
To me.as I reoall the incident, there is pathos
in it; there is prophecy in it," remarked Mr.
Hayes, as he concluded his story.

From the Pittsburg Dispatch.
A big farm house near Belleville, N. J.,
had long stood tenantless and bore the repa
tatlon of being haunted. . At last a yonag
farmer and his wife moved in at a merely
nominal rental. An unearthly clattering on
the stairs frightened the couple half out of
their wits the first night, and the wife trltd
to persuade her consort to get np and inves
tigate. For an hour he argued desperately
with her on the advisability of lying still.
She deolared, despairingly, that if he wonld
not Investigate she mnst die or get up her
self. Finally they effeoted a compromise by
creeping out of bed together. They lit the
lamp and looked cautiously out of the cham
ber door. The firat glance solved the mysa
tery. Big gray squirrels literally swarmed
upon all the landings, and every one of them
had a big nut of some kind between his
paws. The main supply of nuts wag stored
In an unused garret, where some forgotten
tenant had placed . them long ago. The
squirrels arranged themselves in gangs on
eaoh landing, and those at the top of the
honse carried the nuts, one by one, out of
the garret, and sent them rolling down the
atalra to the next landing, where they were
received by the gang waiting for them and
pushed down another flight. In this way
they reached an old cellar, which was evi
dently the squirrels' storeroom, for it was
well stocked with nuts. They were trans
ferring the supply from attlo to basement.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The following are the most important
parts of President Harrison's message to
Congress: '.,-v;
To the Senate and Honse of Representatives:
THK SOUTH AxtRBIGAirS. ' '
It is a matter of high significance, and no
less of congratulatlon.that the firat year of the
second century of oar constitutional existence
finds as honored guests within our borders
the representatives of all the independent
States of North and South America, met to
gether in earnest conference touching the
best methods of perpetuating and expanding
the relations of mutual interest and friendli
ness existing among them. That the oppor
tunity thua afforded for promoting closer
International relations and the increased
prosperity of the States represented will be
used for the mutual apod of all, I eanaot
doubt. Our people will await with interest
and confidence the results to flow from so
auspicious a meeting' of allied and in large
part identical interests. The recommenda
tions of this international conference of en
lightened statesmen will doubtless have the
consideration of Congress and ita co-operation
in the removal of necessary barriers to
beneficial intercourse between the nations of
America. But while the commercial results
whieh it is hoped will follow this conference
are worthy of purauit and of the great inter
est they have excited, it is believed that the
orowning benefit will be found in the better
securities whioh may. be devised for the
maintenance of peace among all Amerloan
nations and the settlement of all contentions
by methods that a Christian civilization can
approve. While viewing with interest our
national resources aud products.the delegates
will, I am sure, find a higher satisfaction in
the evidences of unselfish friendship which
everywhere attend their intercourse with our
people.
.
CANADA AHD THE UNITED STATES.
The questions which have arisen during
the past few years between Great Britain and
the United States are in' abeyance or in
course of amicable adjustment on the part of
the government of the Dominion of Canada.
An effort has been apparent during the sea
son just ended to administer tbe lawa and
regulations applicable to the fisheries with
as little occasion for friction as was possi
ble, and the temperate representations of
this government in respect of cases of undue
hardship or of harsh interpretation have been
in most oases met with measures of transi
tory relief. It is trusted that, the attainment
of "our just claims, nnder existing treaties
and in virtue of the concurrent legislation of
tne two contiguous oountries, win not be
long deferred, and that all existing causes of
difference may be equitably adjusted. I rec
ommend that provision be made by an inter
national agreement for visibly marking the
water bonndary between the United States
and Canada in the narrow channels that
join the great lakes. The conventional line
therein traced by the northwestern boundary
survey, years ago, is not in all cases readily
ascertainable for the settlement of jurisdic
tional questions.
THE NEW REPUBLIC.
The recent revolution in Brazil in favor of
the establishment of a Republican form of
government is an event of great interest to
the United States. Our minister at Rio de
Janeiro was at once instructed to maintain
friendly diplomatic relations with the pro
visional government,' and the Brazilian repre
sentatives at this capital were instructed by
the provisional government to continue their
functions. Our friendly intercourse with
Brazil has, therefore, suffered no interrup
tion. Our minister has been farther in
structed to extend on the part of this govern
ment a formal and cordial recognition of the
new republio as soon as the majority of the
people of Brazil shall have signified their as
cent to its establishment and maintenance.
THE SURPLUS.
The existence of so large an aotual and an
tioipated surplus, should have an immediate
attention of Congress with a view to reduc
ing the receipts of the treasury to the needs
of the government, as closely as may be.
The oolleotion of monies not needed for pnb
lio nses, imposes unnecessary burden upon
onr people, and the presence of so large a
surplus in the public vaults, is a disturbing
element in the conduct of private business.
It has called into use expedients for patting
it into circulation of very questionable pro
priety. We shall not collect revenues for
the purpose ef anticipating onr bonds, be
yond the requirements of tbe sinking fund,
but an unappropriated surplus in the treas
ury should be so used, as there is no other
lawful way of returning the money to cir
culation, and the profit realized by the gov
ernment offers a substantial advantage.
The loaning of public funds to the banks
without interest, npon the security of gov
ernment bonds, I regard aa an unauthorized
and dangerous expedient. It results in tem
porary and unnatural increase of banking
capital of favored localities and compels a
oantious and gradual recall of the deposits to
avoid injury to the commercial interests. It
is nut to be expected that banks having
these deposits will sell the bonds to tha
treasury so long as the present highly bene
fioial arrangement is continued. They now
praotically get interest both upon the bond,
and their proceeds. No farther nse should
be made of this method of getting .the sur
plus into circulation, and the deposits now
outstanding should be gradually withdrawn
and applied to the purchase of bonds. It is
fortunate that such a use can be made of the
existing surplus, and for sometime to ooine of
any casual surplus, that may exist after Con
gress has taken the necessary steps for a
reduction of the revenue. Suoh legislation
should be promptly, but very considerately,
enaoted.
TARIFF REVISION RECOMMENDED.
I recommend a revision of our tariff law,
both in its administrative features and in the
schedules. The need of the former iB gener
ally conceded, and an agreement upon the
evils and Inconveniences to be remedied and
the beet methods for their correction will
probably not be diffioult. Uniformity of
valuation at all our ports is essential, and
effective measures should be taken
to secure it. It is equally desirable
that questions affecting rates and classi
fications should be promptly decided.
The preparation of a new echedule of cus
toms is a matter of great delioacy, because of
its direct effect upon the business of the
country, and of great difficulty by reason of
the wide divergence of opinion aa to the ob-
jeots tbat may properly prompt aucn legisla
tion, some aisturDanoe or uusuimn may
perhaps result from the consideration of this
subject by Congress, but this temporary ill
effect will be reduced to the minimum by
prompt action and by the assurance whioh
the country already enjoys that any necessa
ry changes will be so made as not to Impair
the jnst and reasonable protection of our
home industries. The inequalities of the
law should be adjusted, but the protective
principle should be maintained and fairly
applied to the products of our farms as well
as our shops. These duties necessarily have
relation to other things besides the public
revenues. We oannot limit their effeots by
fixing our eyes on the public treasury alone.
They nave a direct relation to home produc
tion, to work, to wages and to the commer
cial independence of our country, aud the
wise and patriotio legislator should enlarge
the field of his wisdom to include the whole
of these.
The neoessary reduction in our public rev
enues can, I am sure, be made without mak
ing the emaller burden more onerous than
the larger by reason of the disabilities and
limitation which process of reduction puts
npon both capital and labor. The free list
can very safely be extended by placing there
on articles that do not offer injurious compe
tition to suoh domestic products as home
labor can supply. y
The removal of the Internal tax upon to
bacco would relieve an important agricultural
produot from a burden which was Imposed
only because our revenue from oustoms duties-was
insufficient for the pnblio needs. If
safe provision against fraud can be devised,
the removal of tbe tax upon spirits used In
the arts and in manufactures would also
offer an unobjectionable method of reducing
tne surplus.
THE SILVER QUESTION.
The law requiring the purchase by the
treasury of two million dollars' worth of sil
ver bullion eaoh month, to be coined into all
ver dollars of 412 grains.haa been observed
by the department, but neither the present
secretary nor any of his predecessors has
deemed it sate to exercise tne discretion given
by law to increase the monthly purchase to
four million dollars. When the law was en
aoted February 28, 1870, the price of silver
in the market was SI. 20 4-10 per ounce.mak.
Ins the bullion value of the dollar 93 cents.
Since that time the price has fallen es low as
91.2 cents per ounce, reducing the bullion
value of the dollar to 70.6 cents.
Within the last few months the market
price has somewhat advanced, and on the
first day of November last the bullion value
of the silver dollar was 72 cents.
The evil anticipations which have accom
panied the coinage and nse of the silver dol
lar have not been realized. As a coin it has
not had general use and the public treasury
has been compelled to store It. But thla ia
manifestly owing to the fact that its paper
representative is more convenient. The gen
eral acceptance and use of the silver certifi
cate show that silver has not been otherwise
discredited. Some favorable conditions have
contributed to maintain this practical equal
ity in their commercial nse between the gold
and silver dollars. But someof these are
trade conditions that statutory amendments
do not control and the continuance of which
we oannot be certain of.
I think it is clear that if we should make
the coinage of silver at the present rates
free, we must expeot that the difference in
the bullion value of the gold and silver dol
lars will be taken account of in commercial
transactions, and I fear the same result
would follow any considerable increase of
the present rate of coinage. Suoh a . result
would be discreditable to our finanoial man
agement and disastrous to all business inter
ests. We should not tread the dangerous
edge of such a peril, and indeed nothing
more harmful could happen to the silver in
terests. Any safe legislation npon this sub
ject must secure the equality of the two
coins in their commercial uses. I have al
ways been an advocate of the use of silver
in our currency.- --We are large produeersof
that metal and should not discredit it.- To
the plan which will be presented by the secre
tary of the treasury for the issuance 'ot suoh
notes or certificates upon the deposit of: sil
ver bullion at ita market value, I have- been
able to give only a hasty examination, owiDf
to the press of other matters, and to the fact
that it has been so recently formulated. The
details of such a law require careful consid
eration, but the general plan suggested by
him seems to satisfy the purpose to continue
the use of silver in connection with our cur
rency and at the eame time to obviate the
danger of which I have spoken at a later
day. I may communicate further with Con
gress upon this, subject.
KEEPIHO O0T THE CHINESE.
The enforcement of the Chinese exclusion
act has been found to be very difficult oh tha
northwestern frontier. Chinamen landing at
Victoria find it easy to pass our border "Ow
ing to the impossibility, with the'force at the
command of the custom officers, of guarding
eo long an inland line. The secretary of the
treasury has authorized the employment of
additional 6ffieers,-who will "be assigned to
this duty, and every effort will be made to
enforce the law. The dominion exaots a head
tax of $50 for each Chinaman landed, and
when these persons, in defiance of our law,
cross into our territory and are apprehended,
our officers do not know what to de with
them, as the Dominion authorities will not
Buffer them to be sent back without a second
payment of the tax. An effort wilt be made
to reach an understanding that will remove
this difficulty.
.
NO COAST DEFENCES.
Judged bv the modern standards we are
practically without coast defences. Many of
the structures we have would enhance,rather
than diminish, the perils of their garrisons if
subjeoted to the fire of improved guns, and
very few are so located as to give tun eneos
to the greater range of suoh guns as we are
now making for coast defence uses. This
general subject has bad in consideration Con-
cress tor some vears ana me sppiupimuuu
for tbe construction of large rifled guns made
one year ago was, I am sure, tne expression
of a purpose to provide . suitable works in
whioh these guns might be mounted. An
BDnroDriation now made for that purpose
would not advance the completion of the
works beyond our ability to supply them
with fairly effective guns. The security of
ooast cities against foreign attack should not
rest altogether in tbe friendly disposition 01
other nations. There should be a second
line wholly in our own keeping. I very nr-
crentlv recommend an appropriation at this
session for the construction of such works in
our most exposed harbors.
THE NATIONAL GUARD.
I approve the suggestion of the Secretary
of War that provision be made for enoamp
ing companies of the -National Guard in our
coast works for a specified time each year,
and for their training in the use of heavy
guns. Hie-Buggestion that an increase of the
artillery force of the army is desirable is also
in this connection oommended to the consid
eration of Congress.
TERRY'S ASSAULT OS JUDQE FIELD.
The assault made by David P. Terry upon
the person of Justice Field, of the Supreme
court of the United States, at Lathrop, Cal.,
in August last, and the killing of the assail
ant by a deputy United States marshal who
had been depnted to accompany Jostioe Field
and to protect him from anticipated violenoe
at the hands of Terry, in oonneotion with the
legal proceedings which have followed, sug
gest questions whioh, in my judgment, are
worthy of the attention of Congress. I rec
ommend that more definite provision he made
by law, not only for the proteotion of fed
eral offioers, but for a full trial of such
cases in the United States courts. In recom
mending such legislation, I do not at all im
peach either the general adequacy of the
provision made by the State laws for the
proteotion of all citizens, or the general good
disposition of those charged with the execu
tion of such laws to give . protection to the
offioers of the United States. The duty of
protecting ita offioers as suoh, and of punish
ing those who assault them on account of
their offioial acts, should not be devolved ex
pressly or by acquiesence npon the local au
thorities. Events, which have bean brought to my
attention, happening in other parts of the
country, have also suggested the propriety of
extending, by legislation, further protection
to those who may be called as witnesses in
the courts of the United States. The law com
pels those who are supposed to have knowl
edge of public offenses to attend upon our
courts and grand juries and to give evidence.
There is a manifest resulting duty that these
witnesses shall be protected from injury on
account of their testimony. The investiga
tions of criminal offenses are often rendered
futile, and tbe punishment of crime impossi
ble, by the intimidation of witnesses.
:
THE SUBJECT OF TRUSTS.
Earnest attention should be given by Con.
gress to a consideration of the question how
far the restraint of those combinations of
oapltal commonly called "trusts" is a matter
of federal jurisdiction. When organized, as
they often are, to crush out all healthy com
petition and to monopolize the production or
sale of an article of commerce and general
necessity, they are dangerous conspiracies
against the public good and should be made
