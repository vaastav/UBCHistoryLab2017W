What becomsp of the old stock argu
ment that "women cannot vote intelli
gently in view of the result of the
sctiool election last Saturday.
We are still uncertain us to who
really discovered the north pole, but
we are ready to assert that in its mi
grations it humpd into tin) Puget Sound
country this week.
This i. the time of year when the
bold, bad plumber lets not his right
hand know what his left hand doetli.
S>Ve:al gentlemen who would will-
Inkly serve the city In almost any ap
pointive office, the remuneration for
which would Ik* commensurate with
th<|ir self-appraised ability, are wond
ering what will be in their Christmas
stocking.
The switchmen are conducting one of
the most orderly strikes on record. The
policy of Uheb officials in keeping the
men away from the yards entirely i- a
wise) one and will throw the blame for
any disorder that may possibly arise
when- it belongs. It is a notorious fact
that the rioting and disorder that oe
eured during the great A. R. IT, strike
of 1894. was for tlx) most part preci
pitated by Piakerton men. with the In
tent of discrediting the strikers with the
general public by laying the deeds of
violence to tils' railway employes on
strike.
The rejection of the budget by the
House of Lords, a tfhing unknown for
300 years, has precipitated a crisis in
English politic* and will very proba
bly result in the abolition of the Upper
House. The Lloyd-George budget is the
most ladieal piece of legislation from
the standpoint of the wealthy and
titbfd property holders ever proposed
in any country. From the standpoint
of the COmmOfl people it is the most
sensible and beneficient legislation rjver
attempted. It is so much farther ahead
of any legislation ever before proposed
for the relief from burdensome taxation
of the common people fli.it the monied
interest, ~t' all countries stand aghast
at the, proposition. The one great factor
in bringing about even the serious ran
-ideration of this legislation in the
English parliament has been the solidar
ity of the lalxir vote.
Working men of other countries
should hear that fact well in mind.
Every attempt on the part of the
ruling class in England to fasten some
n»nv onerous condition upon the work
ing people lias Iweu answered by the
election of working popple to the House
of Commons until fifty-seven of them
now stand together. Voting for the pro
tection of the toilers of Great Britain.
It i- aa certain as anything can be in
this world that the dissolution of par
I lament ami the nomine electiotH will
have bfirned to submerge their indivi
dual isms and whisme, and. lieing hu
man they probably have as many as
the people to make their laws, taking
a chance of getting thoii Issue and the
onr they have .i-cn and gvasptffl is to
get working people into |>aliainent.
What could not sixty labor representa
tives in tin- congress of the t'nited
State, accomplish is it not very plain
that they would constitute a balance
of power not to be sneered at I It

should be equally plain that this bal
ance of power could divnand ami secure
real labor legislation. How long it is
going to take us t" leant that we are
going to get miglity little relinf from
these "friends of labor*- before elec
tion v And how much more, must we
stand before we will forget minor dif
ferences and realize that we are all
striving toward the same ultimate re
suit and therefore must quit hauling
and pulling at cross purposes in the po
litical game 1 How long are we going
to let the working people of England
lead the, way?
