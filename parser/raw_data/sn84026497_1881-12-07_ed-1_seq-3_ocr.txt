The Star routers art not to escape
ns easily ns they imagined, by the
legal quibble which dashed their for
mer proceedings. The grand jury
convened in Washington Tuesday and
found a true bill agaiust two of those
fompriraised, oue for offering and pay
ing a briba and the other for being
the recipient thereof. Now that the
matter is started rightly, tbere should
ba no hesitancy in "pushing things,"
and bringing the guilty to condign
punishment.
Congkess convened on Monday, the
Republicans securing the complete
organization of the House. General
Joseph Warrea Keifer, of Ohio, was
elected Speaker of the House by a
clear majority of 11. McTberson of
Pennsylvania was elected Chief Clerk.
Nothing of importance except this
wa9 done. The Democrats supported
ex-Speaker Randall, and the Green
backers cast their eight votes for
Ford, of Missouri. The President's
Message was read on Tuesday. It is
an able and statesmanlike document
ant! is very favorably commented
upon by the press of the country, gen
erally. We will issue it in supplement
form next week.
The defense in the Guiteau trial
have closed, and the arguments by the
counsel will be made forthwith, unless
it should be thought necessary to offer
some rebuttal evidence, which does
not now Beern to be the case. As the
case stands now it seems to be about
six of one and half a dozen of another,
as to whether the jury will believe
Ouiteau insane or not. It does not
soem possible that they can say he is
not responsible foi the murder, but
there is no telling, and we must wait
and see. We Lope to Lave the satis
faction of announcing next week that
the murderer has been found guilty,
and the week after that ho has
stretched hemp.
Keifer commences well. His in
tention to make Judge Kelly Chair
inaa of the Ways and Means Com
mittee, emphasizes the lact that the
Protectionists are in control of the
present Congress, and that there is to
be uo tampering with the tariff at its
hands. When Pennsylvania had the
Speaker, in the person of Samuel J.
Randall, that gentleman did not dare
go contrary to the principles of his
party and so pluced a .Free Trader
from New York City, Fernando Wood,
at the head of the Ways and Meaas
Committee. Speaker Keifer realizing
that the Republican party was com
mitted in the last Presidential cam
paign to an exactly opposite line of
policy places a Pannsyivania Protect
ionist at the head of this important
committee.
I B
The Commomvealth asserts what
isn't true when it eays the Republi
can and Democrat are "double team
ing" the Greenback party. What this
paper does it does independent of any
organ outside of the Republican party,
and fights Democrats just as hard,
and Larder for that matter, than it
does Greenbackers, because theDamo
cratis is the great party next to the
Republican. When tho Commonwealth
tries to hoodwink the people by telling
them lhat the Greenback party is
growing rapidly it is our duty to, and
our readers demand that we should
refute the falsehoods, and we'shall con
tinue to do eo as long as that sheet
persists in publishing them. The fig
ures we Lave published showing the
rapid dwindling of that party are cor
rectevery one of them, and because
that paper cannot deny or refute them
it holds up its hands iu holy horror,
and appeals to the sympathies of the
people. It has repeatedly called for
figures and it has at least got its belly
full of them. If the Greenback party
had gotten just what Republicans
9tayed at Lome in Pennsylvania alone
this fall it would have had double the
number of vot. that it ever polled in
the State, aud more than half as many
as it received in the whole United
States. Caesar's gho.t ! think of it;
"double teaming" a party that only
lie I 14,1)70 votes out of a possible
',101, or over a h.-ili million ! Why
AtWy the u.i !.inJc?t cut of all.
J. 13. WOK.
Tiik ticket mooted fr th Repnbli
cans next year, consisting of Grow
for Governor and Caven for Lieuten
ant Governor, and said to be advoca
ted by Col. Quay, is not sweeping over
tho State with anything like irresisti
ble fury. It is rathar early to com
mence booming Mr. Grow or aDy
other aspirant. Hon. Wayne Mac
Veagh's desertion of the Star route
prosecution, perpetrated in disregard
of the President's wishes and entreat
ies, places him outside the entries for
State preferment. It is to be remem
bered that President Arthur has not
yet accepted MacVeagh's resignation
as Attorney General. While tho ex
act cause is not known, tho Executive
action is generally approved. The
announcement is made that the Attor
ney General will shortly state his pos
ition. The public will certainly be
interested to know upon what ground
Mr. MacVeagh justifies h'u course.
Pending the publication of his state"
ment, a judicial opinion has been pre
pared showing that a public officer,
haviig accepted a public trust, is not
at liberty to abandon it at will, but
must have the assent of the appointing
power. Franklin lcss.
If Guiteau is a lunatic, thero are
people who would like a lunatic for a
lawyer, just as Mr. Lincoln wanted to
find out tho brand of whisky one of
his most successful Generals was said
to drink too much of, in order that he
might send a barrel of it to every Gen
eral in the army. It will be remem
bered that Guiteau 6poke scornfully of
his middle name, Julius, on the ground
that there was "too much of the negro
about it." Now it 85 happeus that
there is a nego on the jury, a little
circumstance which Guiteau evidently
recalled after this hasty remark had
been made. Wednesday, thereforo,
this maniac, this wildly insane person
who is utterly unable to distinguish
between right a'td wrong and totally
uuable to control his actions, made a
little speech to the jury fchowing the
high respect he entertained for the
colored race. The prejudice against
the name "Julius" was "contracted
twenty years ago:" he "meant no dis
courtesy to the race." This little inci
dent, together with Guiteau's threat to
the Judge, that if he did a -certain
thing "the Court in bane would re
verse him," and his sharp correction
of Mr. Scoville in saying "we admit
the shooting but not the killing," sug
gests the possibility that if he should
escape conviction, he might still make
a good living at his profession with
the "reputation" he has acquired, and
by leaving the "theology" alone. He
is evidently a better lawyer than some
of our New York Polico Justices, who
would probably take in banc to be an
allusion to faro. A7. Tribune.
Re-districting the State.
The Judges (or a majority of them)
of the Supreme Court of this State
have lately committed an outrage on
the people of the State which it would
hardly seem possible for them to stoop
to. They have redistricted the State
bo as to leave Allegheny, Beaver,
Green, Jefferson, Venango, Westmore
land aud Washington counties in the
Western District; Adams Daupinand
i rankhn counties in the middle dis
trict, and all ths other counties in the
eastern district for which the courts
are held in Philadelphia, thus com
pelling the people of those counties to
go to that city when they have cases
before tho Supreme court. Heretofore
the people of the Western part of the
State were only obliged to go to Pitts
burgh. The Harrisburg . Telegraph
has this to say on the subject: "The
outrage perpetrated by the Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania in compelling
litigants and lawyers to take their
business to Philadelphia ii evoking
earnest protest and in some cases ca
lumny from the press. The action of
the court has nothing to excuse iC ex
cept the ease and comfort of the
judges. But the judges are not to be
at their ease and comfort. They can
have these luxuiies by retiring. The
people pay the Supreme Court to trans
act the people's business with the
greatest expedition and least expense.
The judges have been bribed by their
desire for ease, comfort and the fasci
nations of a large city to disregard
the interests of the people by making
litigation in the court of last resort
both inconvenient and expensive. If
the newspapers continue their denun
ciation of the court's action it will not
bo diflicult to procure remedial legis
lation, and if lhat legislation comes
and i by its stringent provisions made
relalitntory, tho judges will have only
themselves to thank. The people now
know that the Supreme Court judges
have no respect for law when it con
flicts with their oVn crnvenience," and
it is not unreasonable that the supremo
authority should treat the Supreme
Court as tho Supreme Court treats all
violators of tho law make them fear
where they will not obey."
