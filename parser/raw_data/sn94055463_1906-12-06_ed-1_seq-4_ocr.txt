'l'here has bcen to much of the
opinion-not exprcsscd , pcrhaps ,
-but implied , at leastof "the
public be d-"on tbe part of
many corporations and combina-
tions. Many of them ha\'e finally
come to see their error , and have
.
.
tried through publicity bureaus
to educate the public to a different -
ent view than. that which the
common . people had obtained.
Thcre has undoubtedly been
much truth and justice in what
has been sent out-in the effort
to change public sentiment--but
the work of education came too
late. It fell on unwitling and
unprejudiced cars-cars that .
have become couvinced that ' .no
oed thing- can come out of
Nazareth. " [ i'or years the opinions -
ions of the public were ignored ,
amI then when it was found that
a selfish : ourse had placed public
opinion against them , many
interests suddenl , wolte up anel
vigorously attempted to brin a
change about but it was too late.
'l'he } mblic is like a woman
scorneil-slte wants revenge e\'en
if it injure herself. It is probable
that the public has gone far
enough in somc instances to
injure its own interests , but this
is what would be expected. The
way to secure fair treatment is to
. give it-before being dr'en iu a
corner anel compelled to be just.
'rhe corporations which pursue
such a course need nevel fear
what the llublic in this count.ry
win insist upon having done ,
li'air treatment ' begets . the same
in return.
Now the government is after
the druggist trust. It is hoped
this investigation will not ha\'e
the same effect on the price of
drugs as the prosecution of the
print paper trust. Since the
report went out that the combination -
bination between the manufacturers -
urers of paper had been smashed ,
the price of print paper has
ad vanced $8 per ton.
No message of a president has
been awaited with more 1nterest
than the one of President Roose-
velt' which was delivered to
congress on Tues ay. It proved
to be a logical one , interesting
and deals intelligently with the
live issues. .
117 Duahel. in 9 Houn.
An item recentl.r published
stated thatFrnnk Cramer shuckcd
113 bushels of coni in nine hours
on the James Raines place. .
Last Friday on the . Swope
place , farmed by Clarence
Franklin , the Cramer record was
beaten by George 1.'appan who
shucked 1i7 bushels in the same
length of time. Tappan , who
is about 19 yenrs 01(1 ( , 111 mentioning -
ing the matter , said : "Y OLl can
bet I didn't stop to discuss wilh
anybo y as to whether President
Roosevelt was right or wrong in
ordering the discharge of the
nigger troops. " I
Corn $2 a Duahel.
E. W. 'Vagner , an , operat r on
the Chicago board of trade , has
issued an interesting pamphlet
in which he takes the ground
that denatured alcohol will put
corn up to $2 a bushel and corn
land up o $300 to 5500 per cre.
He says :
"Corn is the biggest , readiest
and best producer of alcohol in
the world. Alcohol is the best
and cheapest available source of
light , heat arld motive power 111
the world. Light , heat and
motive power arc the three agents
closest allied to the civilization ,
development and advancement of
the industrial world a d the COI1-
' ortable existence of mantdnd.
Those who consi er this funny
laugh ; those who think it not
\rue should sell the corn crop of
1906 short , but the farmer who
(1isposes of his corn below 40
cents at home is throwing a way
money. "
To OUlt Convict Lobar.
The Bureau oLLabor has just
iss cd a report devotpd entirel ) '
to the discussion of convict labor.
The tendency of various state
to engage in the manufacture of
goods in competition with free
labor is occasioning much adverse
criticism , for it not only estab.
lishes a dangerous precedent but
it' is inimical to the 1Uterests of
both commerce and labor , 'rhe
dealcr and workingman and ta
. payers in assisting to support the
penal institution , are thus placed
111 the position of creating and
aiding a rival with whom they
cannot hope to compete in th
open market. ' Those states whol

called trusts , adopt this means 01

Joe Moore , secretary of the
RQyal Highlander castle at
Ansley , delivered to Mrs. l\brv
Brown , of this city" Tuesda
night , a draft for 53000 amount
of insurance carried in that order -
der by George Brown , her son ,
of which she is the beneficiary.
1 t will be remembered by the
readers uf the HItl'UUI.tCAN that
Geol Brown was killed a few
weeks ago on the railroad below
Mason City , by the train rUlinng
into his team aud buggy.
The amount will be of great .
value to his mother in her d - I

forcible argument in favor of
life insurance.

Aa Seen by the Inapector.
The Uniuersity Journal , published -
lished at LincoJ11 , contains an
article from the pen of T. Mordy
Hodgman , state inspector of
high schools , in which he
obsen'es the Broken Bow schools
as follows : . .
"Broken Bow has made remarkable -
markable impro\'ements this year
-espcciall ) ' 111 its scientific and
library equipment. For .rears
the burden of hard times and
\lnulating debt has l < ept this
school sadly deficient in adequate
'plant , scientific , equipment ,
library and course ofstudy. Now
all is changed and Broke\1 Bow
bids fair in the near future 1 < J
become a strong leader in th < :
western part'of the state. Thi
happ ) ' transformation is due tc
better times , an ambitious board
and its efficient superintendent ,
J. M. l\IcImloo. Having foUl
high school instructors , a sURer-
intendent trained and experienced
in normal methods and a wide
I territory seeking better ru ra1
teachers , Broken Bow has \ i elJ
undertaken the normal tra1UlUg
, course but the courses will.be .
carried strictly on the fitan ards
su gested in the pubhshed
I syllabi.

three safes at Callawav , were

Grand Island was on hand and
took him to that county wher
