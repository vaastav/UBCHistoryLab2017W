THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Taft's message to Congress is a judicial document. It covers
a good deal of ground and is strong in many of its features. The people will
be relieved to find that there is no beating of torn toms and banging of
cymbals in it. It3 tone is so moderate and tranquillizing that in comparison
of some of the presidential documents preceding, it is an anodyne. Mr.
Taft does not suggest the taking of any drastic and mordant means to bring
about his aims. He is content to let well enough alone. The document will
exasperate no one. There are no doubleshotted ebullitive threats to stir
up a row and yet the president speaks with telling effect. He is the great
moderator and pacifier. Not to frighten away prosperity, not to throw a wet
blanket on business, not to lash the nation into turmoil, are his evident de
sires. A careful reading of the message will show that Taft is in the right
place.
THE OLD GAME OF FOOTBALL SAFER.
It is quite amusing to note the comments on football as a game, made
by those who never saw- a real match between trained elevens. This class
together with the striplings who were running around in short dresses when
the game jumped into prominence are displaying their ignorance by declar
ing that the day of the flying wedge and the mass play were infinitely more
dangerous than the open field and murderous tackling of the up-to-date game.
The kind of football played today is far more perilous to life and limb than
was what is now called the lod-style game. Statistics will prove it and those
who have played the game a dozen years ago will verify it. The old game
was far safer. The looser style of play which it was thought would remedy
the dangerous features of the play has not done so at all. The forward pass
in a broken field with its opportunities for fiendish tackling where men in
play do not have time to find themselves before they are encompassed in
a mad charge in itself is a hard play. Stop illegal piling up, pulling and push
ing a player along. Don't let the offense gather too much power before it
hits the line. Eliminate the forward pass and narrow the neutral zone
between the scrimmage lines and many dangerous features will be eliminated.
Keep TaiTis out of the game unless they have a physicians certificate that they
can play and there won't be 3S killed, S00 maimed and hundreds more injured.
HAS HAMMOND GROWN? WELL RATHER.
Hammond will have a representation of nearly thirty persons at the
banquet of the Indiana Society of Chicago which is to be held in the gold
room of the Congress hotel. A table is to be set aside for the Hammond
delegation.
This is of no significance except in that it shows the social progress that
has been made by this city in the past fifteen or twenty years. Twenty-five
years ago it is doubtful if a full dress suit could be found in the whole city,
The social activities of the Hammond people of those days was confined
to mask balls, the butcher's picnic, Sunday picnics, dog fights and prize fights
with an occasional trip to a theatre in Chicago. The people of the pioneer
city little dreamed that in the year 1909, thirtty or more Hammondities
would be journeying to Chicago in formal attire, the guests of business men
statesmen, authors and playwrights of national reputation.
As we remarked before the matter is only of interest, in the light of the
past, as showing that Hammond's progress has not been entirely along com
mercial lines. There is something else patent besides the remorseless
pursuit of the lady on the eagle.
Seriously, the influence of such affairs upon, the community is beneficial
To hear and see the greatest artists, authors, speakers and playwrights of
the middle west, for most of them come from Indiana, is a privilege.
Their wisdom and witticism will be reflected, in a degree, upon the com
niunity at large and the local members of the Indiana society who have made
it possible for so many Hammond citizens to attend this delightful affair
are doing more than providing an evening's entertainment for their friends
It was only a few days ago that a man of national reputation who spoke
at a Hammond gathering, expressed the opinion and the serious opinion that
no where else in the state could the affair have been so successfully given
4WH
BLANKET YOUR FAITHFUL ANIMAL.
The cold weather has at last arrived and the old appeal to horse owners
to "blanket your horse" is being made. And if the appeal was made in every
issue of a newspaper, the cost of the space would be paid for in excess, if
any good was accomplished thereby.
It is an old appeal to the faithful old horse, man's best friend, the faith
ful beast who does more for mankind and gets less in return than any other
animal in the animal kingdom.
BianKet your horse. Its a small thing to ask and it is likewise a small
thing to do. Think yourself how you would feel after a hard run to stand
out in .the biting wind, some times for hours with nothing to protect you
How much care does the horse really get? It is true that the horse is us
ually well fed and at night housed in comfortable stables. But in com
parison with other animals, for instance, petted and prized dogs and cats,
who are cuddled and cared for. petted and pampered, fed and feasted,
bathed and -perfumed. Does the horse get any of these? Should he not be
at last well fed and cared for, for what he does in return? Is he not at
least deserving cf a warm outnket during the winter weather?
A little common sense is all that is necessary. Man's heart is not hard
and as a general rule he loves his horse. It's just forgetfulnesp, but don't
forget. Please blanket your horse.
THE gtorm-door is king.

SHOPPING early advice is getting
rretty late.
IT is also the time of the short day
and the bill that bothers to beat the
band.
IT is somewhat of a relief not to
be bothered with flies and mosquitos
anyway.
AND you certainly could never have
seen anything more beautiful than
those trees.
OF course you heard from Medicine
Hat, if it didn't catch you with your
ear tabs on.
THE squdger is persona non grata,
but that doesn't make any difference
to him whatever.

DECIDEDLY NOT, OTTO!
A Chicago newspaper is authority for the statement that one Otto Will
iams is to stage ten-round bouts in Gary in the near future and has been
assured that he can hold the bouts. It is reassuring to read or Mr. Williams
assurance. Perhaps he is Kid Howard in disguise or at least the latter's re
incarnation. The honorable "Kid" a short time ago assured Chicago sports
that all he had to do to pull off bouts in Hammond was simply to hold them.
When the time came, however, the Howard person was sadly disillusioned,
juite likely the sublime faith of Mr. Otto Williams is to be rudely shattered,
indeed it is more than likely that when he pulls cf ten-round fights in Gary,
"the stars will grow old, the sun grow cold and the leaves of the Judgment
Book unfold." Nothing doing Otto! Put not your money in three sheets ad
vertising ten-round bouts In Gary. We have enough troubles of our own
at present without dallying with your ten-round affairs. There are enough
clashes between the authorities and the blind pig owners coming off to furn
ish our pood people with all the excitement necessary without your little
game.
A LITTLE less than three weeks in

THE weather fiend has already be

COULD it be done in your town?
The Plymouth Independent says: fif
teen women in an aid society of this
city. . sat together and sewed for a
whole hour without saying a word. It
was done on a wager and no deaths
occurred, but the scene that followed
when the time was up may be imagin
ed much better than told.
THE SQUARE DEAL.
Young man
Do you know why there is such a
large proportion of failures in busi
ness in this country?
Do you think it is because of lack
cf experience or of energy or of proper
location or of management or of proper
advertising?
All these may have something to do
with business failures; but. according
to a business man who has made his
millions, it is lack of something else.
And what do you suppose is that lack?
Lack of downright business honesty!
You do not think so? You have come
to believe perhaps, as many young men
do believe, that knowledge of the busi
ness, "tricks of the trade," shrewdness
in getting the better of a bargain, the
ingenuity of deceit that these are the
qualities by which men get on in the
world today.
That is where you are mistaken.
The millionaire mentioned, whose
name is known throughout the coun
try, says:
"I'm not a preacher or a moralist
Business isn't a thing to preach or
grow sentimental over. But it is so
6lmple in principle that only a fool
mistakes it and falls."
Continuing, he says:
. "Twenty-five years ago I discovered
for myself that honesty was the easiest
graft known to business. It can't fail
in the bands of a man with common
horse sense. . Once let it get abroad
that every customer coming iuto your
place gets the square deal and you
can't keep them out with a club."
A very strong statement that.
But the man has proved it. He start
ed up in business determined upon a
policy of "making good" to every cus
tomer. His definition of making good was
the Golden Rule that is to say. he de
termined to treat every customer of
his precisely as he would want to be
treated if he were the customer. And
from that policy he reaped a fortune.
Simple?
So simple, as he says, that "only a
fool mistakes It and falls."
There never was enunciated a truer
statement than that of the old copy
books, "Honesty is the best policy."
Do not get It into your head that
rascality pays. Dishonesty spells
FAILURE and spells it in capital let
ters. The square deal wins always, everywhere.
which, resulted in the loss of both his
eyes.
TRY TO CATCH BURGLAR.
An attempt to rob the Phi Delta
Theta House at Bloomington early
Monday morning -was frustrated by two
members of the local chapter, Millard'
