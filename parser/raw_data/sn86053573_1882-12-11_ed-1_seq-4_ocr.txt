There aro iwo new democrat io presidential

laeo by tho Into election Their names arc
riNVixANli and Pattion nnd IholrrlainiS
nio very much nllkoln eharaetcrand strength
being bated on the clrcumsluuro that they
each received a good number of republican
votes and kept pretty quiet during tho cam
paign Thcso nro undoubted merits in n
democratic candidate We would not belittle
them In 1811 the question was Who is
Jamiis K Tom and tho general inability
to answer It made him president Not to be
too well known Is a merit In a dcmoclalle
candidate not to ho despised as Mr Hayaiip
Mr TiltntMAN and Mr HrsmiirKB can
testify mid this Is especially truo of demo
cratic governors for proof of which wo con
fidently refer to Jlr Plaibtki lalo governor
of Maine and Mr MoHnbry present gov
ernor of Louisiana who has recently been
urged and Implored by the leading men of tho
parly not to attempt to distinguished himself
just now after tho fashion of Guovnn in Ore
gon nnd tho fusion chap in Maine
Thero aro some signs however that tho
young governors in New York and Pennsyl
vania will not bo ablo to suppress their ex
pansive tendencies in spllo of ttie ndvico of
eminent statesmen nnd will bo found postur
ing before tho pnblle notwithstanding their
efforts not to poso conspicuously Thus Mr
Pattison has scut word that a military escort
at inauguration will not boncccptublo to him
as not in accord with the simplicity of popu
lar institutions and tho nows barely reaches
llulfilo when CrrvinAMi announces that ho
sees tho point and will not bo outdone in sim
plicity by him of Pennsylvania
nollectingnpon tho gorgeous displays which
used to attend upon tho movements of old
Axnniiw Jacicfon and how little tho people
counted tho cost In comparison with tho
delight of a holiday nnd the sight of the im
posing march of well trained troops to tho
sound of the buglo and trumpet wo have not
been nblo tocouvinco ourselves that tho next
issuo is to como on tho question of do
ing away with holidays pageants nnd suit
able honors to tho favorites of tho nation on
important occasions Wo may bo mistaken
There is no telling how large a forecast these
now statesmen possess They liavo evidently
taken a sharp look ahead aud coming right
from tho peoplo it may bo that they know
what they aro about and that tho peoplo will
indorse tho era of commonplace nud hum
drum with heartiness and alacrity Should
they bo right nnd the next campaign bo fought
on an issuo of this sort Pattison would be a
a great card and might win unless Clivilani
should start something to tuko tho wind out
of his sills
Possibly ho may ho contemplating something
of tho sort Ho has been tnscoTiLiiN Our
sagacious neighbor commends him for this
but wo aro afraid ho has beon to see tho wrong
man John Kiriy is tho man to sco in New
York John Kklly Is thoiunu who was seen
beforo tho nomination nnd ho will liavo to be
seen again This seeing Tildhn is bad on
many accounts Tiliuin is weak Ho made
tho mistake of not sitting down on tho
election parade when he was governor llo
consented to nominating a pair of epaulettes
for flio presidency at tho last election It is
said that ho was elected in 187l and took tho
oath of otllco away from Washington and dis
pensed with tho usual parade but if so tho
result was not fluttering and such conduct
doesnot entitle him toho tho guide of a futuro
chief magistrate It Is supposed that lie is too
weak to tap that barrel of his again and if
so his ndvico is of small account
Tho going MTiLiirN iinpllesaslight distrust
by tho new governor of Ills own ability to
manage No doubt Mr IlAYAitn will com
mend him but Mr 11 very likely does not
regard Mr Clkvklani as tho embodiment of
wisdom nnd would llko to have it appear that
Sajimy is tho actual governor of New York
after all If Hayaud were governor of
his stato ho would not see TllnilN Tho rest
would hardly advlso that Nobody has ad
vised 11in IIutiiir to see Tildijn not oven
tho Springfield Jlepublicaii and no ouo could
possibly imagino tho now govornnr of Massa
chusetts silting lit tho feet of tiio dilapi
dated sago of Lebanon and asking What
shall thy humble servant do without a
laugh
Wo cannot help smiling ourselves at tho
grasp evinced by Pattimin and Cikviiand

It is announced that Joiiann Most and

an unquestionable right to do It and nobody
can object so long as they keep upon the

shell business has unfitted Mr Most More
over as soon as a nihilist learns to rend he
begins to find nut what this country is about
nnd that discovery would destroy his disposi

As to damage to ho done in this country by
such a paper there is nn occasion to think for
an instant Powder burned In tho open air
makes llttlo moro than a bad smell nnd a
smudge which work no uncndiirnblo incon
vehienco to any one Thero is no repression
here no confining of forces that could make
such a proceeding cxploslvo or dangerous
Hut in another viow thero is reason for
reprehending nihilistic effort that is directed
though novcr so harmlessly toward Europe
Tills country has already submitted to tho
odium of having permitted to go unrcbuked
the incendiarism of ODonovan IJOS3A who
openly boasted of having destroyed tho Iirit

men aboard Wo want no moro such reason
for being ashamed of ourselves It isnn abuso

Xuicapai7iicfte
On Monday last The National Republi
can of Washington D C signalized its
regular issue by appearing in au enlarged
form a quarto Instead of a folio with Frank
Hatton ns its editor although tho namo of
that gentleman is not therein mentioned In
an announcement of a change of management
manifestly from tho pen of Mr Halton tho
platform of Tun KeiUiilican is hi telly indi
cated It comprehends vigorous republicanism
and thoroughly go ahead journalism Tlio
promlso is that The Republican will hence
forth tako rank with tho leading journals of
tho country a plcdgo which under any hand
than that of I rank llatton might well bo
deemed uisli and impossible of realization in
Washington by any possibility Hut Mr
llatton Is beyond question ono of tho most
energetic tireless spirited and breezy editors
known to tlio American press and under his
inspiring direction The National Repub
lican will it is very certain present to tho
denizens of tho national capital and to tho
outside world such a newspaper ns has iu its
enterprise ability nud foico never before been
known lu Washington
