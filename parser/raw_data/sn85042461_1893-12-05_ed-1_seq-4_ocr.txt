THE MESSAGE.
Tbe president baa departed from hia
usual habit, and haa given the people a
rather voluminous message, in which he
reviewa with considerable fullneßß of
detail both our foreign relations and
domestic affairß. There are in thiß docu
ment no startling departures from tbe
methods of bia predeceaaors. It ia writ
ten in a remarkably calm and dispas
sionate vein, without the slightest sug
gestion of rhetoric from beginning to
end, and tbe reader will eeach it in vain
for any of the epigrammatic expressions
which have characterized many of his
public utterances in the past. Many of
hie recommendations are characterized
by admirable good sense, notably
that in which he suggests that
the Congress ehould apply itself
to reforming the system by which
such a remarkable increaee has
been brought about in the expenses of
the United Statea -courts. He calls
attention to the fact tbat he made thia
suggestion in his meaaage of 1885, and
gives figures that prove that hia judg
ment waa notably accurate at that time.
The message iB pervaded by a atrong
demand for economy in all lines in which
discretion ia left to congress, and he en
forces this judicioua counsel by ref
erence to tbe marked stringency of the
tunes, and tbe difficulty of accomplish
ing much desired things, auch ac a con
tinuance of naval construction. He
thinks that we ehould rather aim to
complete vessels tbat are already under
way tban to undertake new ones until
times shall have improved.
Hie message differs strikingly from
those of hie predecessor in that he
makes no labored arguments for pet
theories, euch as those so frequently
made by President Harrison on the fed
eral elections laws and the tariff. In
treating the latter topic tbe president
plainly indicates that he is in sympathy
with the Wilson tariff bill. The only
portion of his remarks under this head
that shows any salient, angle tbat might
be attacked by his political oppoueuta is
where he intimates to the workingmen
that they should rather aim at steady
employment than at high wages. His
decriers will douotlees assert that the
ideal of the workingman is rather a
minimum of work and a maximum ol
wageß. On the Hawaiian question,
without being at all demonstrative, he
plainly shows that iie is in favor of the
restoration of Queen Liliuokalani. li is
references to the silver queation are
mainly colorlesß, and he does not dis
guise his opinion that it would he use
less at the present time to re-assemble
tbe Brussels conference, suggesting that
the matter should be left to the discre
tion of the president. On tho subject of
Hawaii he leaves the impression lhat
he may favor coDgreea with a special
message when lie sends in documents
and correspondence on that matter, to
which he refers.
Mr. Cleveland reviews very carefully
and laboriously the reports of the heads
of departments, and haa enriched liia
meßsxgo with a large maeß of instructive
statistics. There is not a line from be
ginning to end of the document which is
couched iv a controversial orpropagand
iet spirit; and, in fact, it ia somewhat
enrprieing from ite temperate lone on
mattera that have been tho subject of
hot debate on the etump and in the
preaa. If the late elections, ao dieaa
troua to the Democratic party, have bad
any effect whatsoever upon him he
shows it only by an imperturbable air
and a temper absolutely judicial. The
result at tbe polls may have contributed
to this moderation, but tbe spirit itself
is simply admirable.
THE HERALD'S BIG SCOOP.
Tbia journal ia not much given to
bragging, but it is only right that, now
and then, we ehould have • good word
to cay commendatory o! our own enter
prise. This is on the principle of the
Missouri editor who acquitted himself
of that just and American sentiment
which runs, "Whoso bloweth not his
own bazoo the same shall not be
Mowed." It is something to be able to
place the President's message in the
bands of one's readers before its read
ing was commenced in the city of Wash
ington. We were enabled to perform
this splendid journalistic feat for tbe
simple reason tbat when it was 12
o'clock m. in Washington, at which
hour tbe clerks began to read tbe
message, it was only 9 o'clock
a. m. in Los Angeles. By 11
o'clock an extra edition of tbe Her
ald containing the message was on ths
street, and the tardy sun arrived just in
time to see the biggest honest journal
istic "scoop" ever recorded in Los
Angeles accomplished. In past years it
has been the practice to send a printed
advance copy of the president's message
to the newspapers belonging to tbe
Associated Press, with an obligation of
honor upon the part of the recipients
not to issue it until a designated hour,
or until a telegraphic release has ar
rived. This usage was departed Irom in
tbe present instance. The message was
telegraphed early yesterday morning,
and was given to our readers in an extra,
the Herald's competent staff handling
it in addition to getting out our regular
edition at the early hour which our im
proved perfecting Hoe press—the best
on tbe Pacific coast — tbe best and
fastest on tbe Pacific coast outside
of the offices of tbe San
Francisco Examiner, Chronicle and
Call—bas made familiar to our patrons.
For the benefit of such of our readers
as failed to get a copy of yesterday's
"Extra," we reproduce the message in
exteneo this morning.
Tbe Kxpreea meeta onr memorable
acoop aa follows: "To the esteemed
Herald: 'That's a horse on us!'"
In the language of tbe Boeotian
poet: "'Null aaid." We have come
curiosity to see how our ponderous
morning contemporary takea the lesson
in enterprise which we administered to
it in auch a well accentuated chape.
Motto of the Herald: "Always the

THE ORANGE GROWERS' ASSOCIATION.
Tbe organization of the orange grow
ers in Southern California has assumed
much larger proportions than its moat
sanguine friends had dared to hope for
at the beginning. It now embraces tbe
owners of something over five thousand
car loada of fruit, but the work ia not
regarded aa complete, and ell arts will
not be relaxed by ita projectora until the
entire crop is under control, or nntil a
grower ia diacovered who ia able to give
a good and sufficient reason for not
identifying himaelf with tbe movement.
The reasons that have actuated the
growers who bave already asaociated
themselves together for the purposes of
mutual protection apply with equal
force to the growers who are still stand
ing aloof. While these are few in num
ber, they are yet sufficiently numerous
to operate aa a menace to the organisa
tion. Ab an offset to thia condi
tion we are told that the num
bers of the dissident! are being rapidly
diminiahed in consequence of the very
general satisfaction exoreeeed in rela
tion to the adjustment of matters of
detail at the meeting of tbe dis
trict boarda of exchange, recently held
in thia city. Tbe growers of oranges
are, as a ruie, men of intelligence and
average business ability, and they natu
rally foresee that any temporary advan
tage to be gained by permitting their
fruit to find ita way intochannela antag
onistic to the general movement will be
more than offset by the disaster that
must follow the overthrow or failure of
the organization. Relying upon this,
the projectora are hoping to secure prac
tical control of the situation, Thia will
be an achievement without parallel in
movements of this character, and will
augur well for the future of the fruit in
dustries ef Southern California, if the
growers otand loyally in line until busi
ness methods, under a system, shall
solve the problem of marketing the
crop.
SOME SUGGESTIVE HYGIENIC FACTS.
Sir John Temple, a distinguished
Birfteeman of the closing daya of the
Stuart regime iv England, and who waß
a tiood deal of v liti rateur, aaid, in one of
hie contributions to the current goeeip
of that day, that it had grown into a
practice for people who were pretty
well up in yeara and easy in meana to
transport themselves to .Mexico and to
South and Central America, and that
thereby they greatly increased their
hold on life, frequently adding twenty
yours and upwards to their Bpan, thu?
hsauring men of sixty an exteneion of
longevity which enabled them to enjoy
liie to eighty aud ninety yeara.
II Sir John Temple haa known any
thing of Loa Angelea he wou,ld have ad
vised hie friends to Beck thia climate,
and probably he would have come here
himaeli. The hygienic conditions of
Hub city and county and of Southern
California generally are exceptional in
the highest degree. Nothing is co con
vincing as a etatement of facta in sup
LOS ANGELES HERALD: TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER !t 189 R.
port of any position assumed by writer
or disputant, and we shall proceed to
sustain our position by a number of
striking circumstances.
Dr. Kaunon has been the physician of
the Roman Catholicorpban asylum dur
ing tbe past five years. During that pe
riod the number of infante under the
charge of the sisters bas run from three
hundred and eighty to four hundred,
most of them under five years of age.
During that whole period there have
been only three deaths, and the circum
stances attending those deaths were ex
ceptional. One of the little ones, who
was only a half orphan, was permitted to
visit friends at one of our seaside resorts.
There typhoid fever was contracted, and
on return to the asylum the little one
died. The second was a case of a little
one whose fingers were cut off by a ma
chine in the bakery, and who died from
blood poisoning. The third was tbe case
of an idiotic child, who had cephalic
affections which reudered death inevit
able under any circumstances, and who
died from meningitis.
During tbis whole period there was
not a single death from cholera infan
tum. The significance of this fact can
only be realized when it is borne in
mind that ia tbe east m similar institu
tions twenty-six per cent, of children
who are attacked by tbis fell disease,
and who are over five years of age, and
fifty-six of those under three years, die,
in spite oi all tbe efforts of intelligent
physicians and untiring nurses to save
tbem. Another alarming cause of mor
tality in eastern hospitals and asylums
is pneumonia. In the five years in
which Dr. Kannon has bad charge of
the lioman Catholic orphan asylum
there has not been a single death from
pneumonia, and, indeed, there bas not
been a single case of true pneumonia,
tbe visitation here being of the type
called bronchial pneumonia.
In view of such facts it is small won
der tbat the people ot Los Angeles, in
selling their lands, charge a trifle for
climate.
The comments ou the preeident'e
meßßage which appear elsewhere are
largely tinged by the political preposses
sions of those who give utterance to
them. It ie a good deal the old show
man's formula, "You pays your money
and you takea your choice." Perhaps
the most salient comment in the whole
line ia that of Senator John M. Palmer,
of Illinois, a devoted friend of the preei
dent, and a gentleman who probably
did more tban anybody to secure his
nomination, who antagonizes very
strongly Mr. Gleveland'e utterances on
the pension aueßtion. Perhaps the
moat extraordinary outgiving of the
whole Mat of commentators ia that of
Senator Shoup, who expresses eurprieo
that the president has proposed no plan
for the rehabilitation of aiiver. Shoup
baa not heretofore postun.ed aa a hu
morist, but in thia obaervation he shows
latent powers in tbat line that threaten
the supremacy of Bill Nye himself.
When tbe curtain rings up on the effect
ive work of the session we shall doubt
less hear more elaborate expression of
nninion. . - \iaa,i »»i...
eeea in Cleveland a rival to claims
of czarrjhip, speaks of the document and
of the president's attitude with all the
envy of a man who baa been dethroned.
HOW IT WAS DONE.
Thanks Extended to the Western Uulo
nud Its Kmployoes.
Tbe thanks to the Herald are due to
tba Weaterh Telegraph company for ita I
prompt transmission of the preaident'a
message, which enabled this journal to
place it in type and present it to tbe Loa
Angelea public in the shape of an extra
before the evening contemporary got a
move on itself. It is the cußtom of the
Western Union company to furnish
gratia to all members of the ABaociated
Press advance copies of important docu
ments like tbe preaident's message, so
that the matter maybe "setup" and
held in readiness to go to press when
ever the word "go" cornea from head
quarters. Oi course, only enterpriaing
papera like the Herald take advantage
of thia arrangement and give the news
to the public fresh, aa was iustanced
yesterday morning.
To Superintendent Beardalee and
hia able staff, of the local
Western Union office, also, The
Herald expresaea ita appreciation
of their prompt and efficient service.
The 15,000 or more worda of the presi
dent's message came over their wires
and was received at this end by the
following operators: Me ers. J. 0. De
Long, F. N Wilkinson and P. L. War
ren. It waa all neatly taken with type
writer, and was by long odds the best
telegraph copy that ever came to thia
office in euch bulk. These geutlemen
are all masters of their art. Mr. De
Long was for many years chief operator
tcr the Chicago Tribune. Mr. Wilkin
son haa rendered long service with the
Western Union and is considered one of
their beet men. Mr. Warren has no
superior anywhere in the telegraphic
art. His copy is tho delight of the tele
graph editor and printers' hearts.
To Mr. B. C. Stevenson, the gentle
manly night manager, alao ia due. a
meed of praise for the manner in winch
he kept things moving. In addition to
I the president's message, the gentlemen
1 mentioned above also handled the regu-
I lar report of abont 8000 worda. Alto
i gather it was a big work well
j done.
Th» Revenue Office,
Mr. Guy 13. lia-ham, the well-known
internal revenue broker, has aucceeded
L. C, MclCeeby aa stamp deputy in the
local revenue office.
There haa been no change whatever
in the local depniyship. The incumbent,

AMUSEMNTS
BtRitANK Theater.—The production
of Richard 111. last evening marked tho
opening of the second week, and one
that will be as successful as the first one
of this new bouse. Mr. Darrell Vinton
assumed the role of tbe crafty "Duke
of Qloster," and was well seconded by
the stock company.
Mr. Vinton is evidently a capable act
or, with tbe necessary supply of vigor
and a voice of power and endurance.
He played tbe trying role with a marked
determination to do his best to satisfy
his audience.
Miss Georgie Woodthorpe wae the
"Elizabeth," and little Georgie Cooper
was the prince, making a charming
little iellow.
It was mado evident that tbe man
agement has exerted itself to produce
the great drama ac far as its resources
would permit properly and with dignity.
The bouse was well filled and the
breaks and errors which always occur
on first nights were noticeably few. The
audience was kindly disposed and on
the whole it looks as if the experiment
of Shakespeare at popular prices would
be a financial success.
Whatever view may be taken as to
the artistic value of the production, tbe
venture is highly commendable. A fine
play even pooriy played is always better
than a poor play finely played, and a
manager who, outside of a metropolis,
will produce ohakeßpearean drama
shows a confidence in the elevated taste
of his patrons that in the present case
appears to be well founded.
Richard will be given thiough the
week.

CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY.
A Peculiar Oeearranoa Whereby a
Home Was Killed.
A peculiar thing happened yesterday.
Ramish & March, the animal crema
tors, received a telephone message that
a dead horse was lying in the river
awaiting removal.
A man proceeded to the place Indi
cated to take the beast to the crematory.
To hiß surprise, he found a horse that
was about as much alive as dead. This
seemed somewhat peculiar, but he did
not hesitate in killing the animal and
removing it, as he supposed bis in
structions related only to tbia animal.
An hour or two elapsed and another
message came.
"Why don't you get that dead horse
from the river?"
"We did." said Ramish.
"You didn't, and "
Ramish hung up the receiver. He
bad got an idea. Could there have been
nno l her horse, he thought.
He proceeded to investigate and found
Ihe dead horse referred to in tbe river.
He slowly bore tbe animal away, think
ing sadly of how he had, through mis
taken identity, got the wrong horse.
The only explanation tbat Ramish
would give was tbat tbe first horse was
"about dead, anyhow."

The groat jewelry and art establishment of

Third and Fourth, Is rapidly assuming shape,
and hundreds of people stop daily to admire
the beautiful goods which are displayed in tbe
show windows. Theße, however, give but a
faint conception of the wealth and vari

which sre exposed foe sale within.
This estab'ishmcnt will be a Godsend to that
numerous class of citizens who desire to select
some artistic piece ol jewelry or work of art,
either for themselves or as a present, and who,
while having little knowledge on the subject
themselves, desire to be sure that wbat they
buy Is exactly as represented, and tbat they
aienot being charged an exorbitant price bo
cause of their lack of technical knowledge.
It is generally understood that In the average
jewelry store prices are moro or less elastic, de
pending tn a great extent on the knowledge or
acumen of tne buyer. This is not the case at
German's, where a child may buy as advan
tageously as a man who "knows the ropes." A
