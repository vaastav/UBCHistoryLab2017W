The parcels post sale held in the
hall Friday evening, for the benefit of
the V. I. S. was an unqualified suc
cess, both socially and financially. The
parcels went like "hot cakes," and
shouts of laughter greeted the reve
lation of the contents of sundry pack
ages, while many of the boxes held ar
tides whose intrinsic value was much
more than the modest Drice asked.
Hot coffee and sandwiches were dis

PRESIDENT WILSONS MESSAGE
( Continued from
Into conspiracies against Hie ueiitralit
of the government, they have sought
to pry Into every confidential trans
action of the government ki order to
serve Interests alien to our own. It Is
possible to deal with these things very
effectually. I need not suggest the
terms In which they may be dealt with.
I wish that It could be said that only
a few men, misled by mistaken senti
ments of allegiance to tl -. governments
under which they were ,ru, had been
guilty of disturbing the self possession
and misrepresenting the temper and
principles of the country during these
days of terrible war, wheu It would
seem that every mau who was truly an
American would Instinctively make it
his duty and tils pride to keep the
scales of judgment even and prove him
self a partisan of no nation but his
own. Hut It cannot. There are some
men among us and many resident
abroad who. though born and bred in
the United Stales and calling them
selves Americans, have so forgotten
themselves and their honor as citizens
as to put Ibeir passionate sympathy
with oue or the other side in the groat
European conflict above their regard
for the peace and dignity of the United
States. They also preach and practice
disloyalty. No laws, 1 suppose, can
reach corruptions of (he mind and
heart, hut I should not speaU of others
without also speaking of these and ex
pressing the even deeper humiliation
and scorn which every self possessed
and thoughtfully patriotic American
must feel when ho thinks of them ami
of the discredit they are daily bringing
upon tis.
What is more important is thai the

Florida Educational Association.
A great many inducements are of
fered to teachers and school offcers
to attend the Florida Educational As
sociation to be held in Tallahassee,
December 28-30. This convention has
a maximum attendance of eight hun
dred, and on this occasion efforts are
being made to interest the entire body
to be present.
bmce the meeting is held during
the holidays, it gives every teacher
the time to come; and surely a
days' session devoted to intellectual
and professional interests will give in
spiration to every teacher.
The railroads have granted reduced
rates from all parts of the state to the
capital city; and very reasonable rates
of from one to two and a half dollars
a day for board have been arranged
for by the local committee. The Leon
Hotel has been selected for h.eadquar
ters and the State College for Women
has arranged to take care of three
hundred persons at one and a half
dollars per day.
The program shows a rrreat deal of
splendid work on the part of Profes
sor Charles M. Jones of Lakeland; it
gives a number of questions of vital
interest to the schools of the state;
and the names of many of the lead
ing educators of Florida who will give
addresses. The special lecturer for
the occasions is Dr. Harrjr Clark' of
tne university of Tennessee. He is a
graduate of Yale, and has had liber
al experience in the public school
systems of the southern country.
The fact that Tallahassee is thp
capital with its many departments of
state government, will induce many
neople to visit the place at this time.
The State College for Women, the
Leon County Hieh School, the city
and the county, are all combining
their efforts to make the Association
a profitable and happy occasion. Be
sides the regular routine program,
several delightful forms of entertain
ment are planned. It will pay anyone
to attend this Association for it means
much in one's nrofessional and socinl
