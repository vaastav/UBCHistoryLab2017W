tIONEYAND COMERCE.
MONETARY.
ft
Thursday Evening, Dec. 5,
There were no special features in connection
with local finances to-day. Money continues
about as tight as ever, and tho offers of com
mercial paper at tho banks are in excess of their
ability to take, bo that tho open market is still
well supplied with prime commercial paper at
134 and 2 per cent per month, hut the move
ment of hogs aud cattle continues large, and
will doubtless have a favorable effect on the
money market before long.
New York exchange was scarcer to-day, and
sold between banks at 23c per SI,OOO premium.
The Hide and Leather Bank, with a capital of
$300,000, has commenced business at tho south
west comer of Eandolph and LaSalle streets. It
was the intention of its stockholders to organize
as a National Bank, and they obtained tho neces
sary permission from tho Comptroller to do so,
but when it was found that they would bo re
quired to make tho usual deposit of one-third of
their capital in bonds, and yet bo allowed but
half the customary circulation, they concluded
to operate under a State charter, paying up tho
capital Stock in accordance with the National
Currency act. The Comptroller, in his recent
report, has recommended tho adoption of an
amendment which would remove the well-found
ed objection of tho Hide and Leather Bank, and,
if adopted, tho institution will reorganize as a
National Bank. Among tho stockholders are
manywealthy and conservative business men,
who will doubtless manage the affairs of the
bank with safety and prudence.
In another column will be found tho announce
ment of the Central National Bank, just opened
for husinoes'in Methodist Church Block. Among
the names of the Directors we notice those of
well known aud substantial business men, indi
cating tho success of the institution. Tho
President, W. F. Endicott, Esq., was formerly a
well-known banker here, and James McK. San
ger, the Cashier, is well known to the business
community from his connection with tho Third
National for many years. Among the stockhold
ers are understood to be capitalists in Now York,
Boston, and Chicago, and the capital stock is
paid np in full.
FREE BANKING.
The money stringency of tho past six weeks
has set people to thinking about banking ques
il-.ojs, one of tbe results of winch Is tho general
demand for “free banking” incident to the dis
cussion and criticism of the treatment of cur
rency questions in the President’s Message, and
the reports of the Secretary of the Treasury and
Comptroller of the Currency. "While The Cm
cago TnnmxE has for years denounced tho em
pirical arguments of currency-quacks who, claim
to know just how much currency we need, and
insist that the Government shall issue its notes
to suit their views, it has as steadily denounced
tho monopoly of National Bank circulation and
a dvocated the removal of all restrictions to its
volume or the place of its issue.
The New York Journal of Commence,
Now York Bulletin, and some other prominent
commercial and financial journals of the
country, have also advocated similar views, but
it is only within a week that a majority of the
New York City press have come out squarely for
free banking.
The Herald of the 2Dth, in its money article,
says;
“ The continued scarcity of money in the mer
cantile interest, no matter how easy the market
may he to other classes of borrowers, will
doubtless lead to an agitation for a freer system
of hanking and the certain defeat of every
measure contemplating the contraction of the
existing banking facilities of the Eastern and
Kiddle States. The matter of banking facilities
seems to be one which regulates itself and if the
system of banking were rigidly based on the
present foundation of deposits at Washington of
bonds to secure the noteholders against loss, it is
hard to conceive • f .danger could arise in
7nalr' r ''- a system free and general. Banks
.uiu be organized when and where needed,
and then and there only.”
The New York Times (money article) dis
cussing the timid proposal of the Comptroller
of the Currency to increase National Bank circu
lation at tho rate of §5,000,000 per month says :
*♦ It would have been better if tho Comptroller
had gone farther, as Congress, in the end, will
have to go, and favored the removal of all re
strictions, other than security, on tho National
Bank circulation. This would make the sys
tem what it was originally designed to he,
free banldng. Such was tho model system of
the State of New York, upon which tbe nation
al law was framed, and no one complained in
that day, or felt exercised about the expansion
or contraction of a bank-note circulation, be
cause the law left every banker free to employ
New York State and United States stocks as
security/or whatever circulation he could make
useful'to the public , and profitable to himself.
Public opinion is being directed to tho same
provision in our national system, and we believe
the time draws neear when Congress will feel
that the measure of bank-note circulation, am
ply secured by the public funds of the United
States, lodged at Washington, had best be left
to its own ‘ regulation.* **
The New York Commercial Advertiser , of the
same date, also says:
“ Give us prompt and efficient redemption of
National Bank notes in this city, and then let
Rational Banks receive as many notes as they ap
ply to Vie Comptroller for , with the bonds as re
quired by law. * * * Give us a redemption
that can be enforced daily in this city, Clearing-
House fashion, and we shall never be surfeited
with National Bank currency.*
Some other journals, like the Advertiser, seem
over-solicitous about tu© plan of redemption for
National Bank notes. Wo do not see any oc
casion for this solicitude. If the restrictions on
the rolume of National Bank circulation were
entirely removed, it would increase but slowly,
as is shown bv the length of time it has taken to
al-nurb the 651,000,000 authorized by tho act of
2 1870, but, as tho proportion between green
backs and National Bank notes was changed, by
tr e increase of the latter, a system of redemp
tion through the agency of the Clearing Houses
of tho various redemption cities would naturally
suggest itself.

Your Committee further Btato in regard to the sev
eral balances of grain in store and outstanding receipts
for same, that the books of Flint, Thompson k Co. show
that the greater part of the losses or gains occurred
previous to their ■weighing over one year ago. Tour
Committee think it proper to state that they find that
the books of Messrs, Flint, Thompson k Co. are kept
in so perfect a manner as to plainly show the daily
transactions, as well as the periodical balances with
precision—each furnishing a check upon the other In
each a manner as to render any error or fraudulent
entries easily detected.
Your Committee also took pleasure in bearing testi
mony to the courtesy they met with at the hands of
Messrs. Flint, Thompson k Co., and the willingness
they manifested to have your Committee get at the ac
tual state of affairs in regard to the amount of grain in
store and receipts outstanding for tho_ same. Yours,
very respectfully,
THE SIABKET3.
The loading produce markets wore again quiet,
but a shade firmer all around, for no special rea
son except that the tide of both Chicago and
New York commerce, like that of the ocean,
moves in waves; one day wo are in the trough
and another on the crest, hut all the time obey
the injunction of the Old World policeman to
« Keep moving.” We are now fairly entered on
the evo of winter trading, and operators have
scarcely become accustomed to the situation in
grain, while they are afraid of provisions. Our
receipts of grain are somewhat less than has
been antiepated; but will, undoubtedly, increase
before long, as will our shipments by rail.
The dry goods trade was rather less active to
day, but the aggregate of sales made a very fair
showing, and onr jobbers generally express
themselves as satisfied with the present condi
tion of the market. In certain lines of goods
the supply is a little short, though tho general
stocks are liberal, and well assorted. A slight
advance was established in one or two brands of
bleached and brown cottons, with which excep
tion values were unchanged,—ruling firm both
for cotton and woollen textiles. Groceries were
again reported quiet, with an easy feeling preva
lent, the only notable exception being coffoos,
which were in good request, *ud docidealy firm.
The butter market continues fairly active at
about previous rates, local and ouatida buyers
operating on a liberal scale at B@2oc for com
mon to medium, and at 22@2Sc for good to
choice. Bagging continues dull, but cotton
seamless goods are working a little firmer, ow
ing to tho enhanced cost of the raw material.
Prices may be quoted steady at 35c for Stark,
34>£o for Ludlow, and at 340 for Lewiston.
Cheese remains dull and weak. Coal was firm
at 612.00 for Lackawanna; at slo.so@ll.oofor
Erie • and at 67.00 for Wilmington. Stocks of
Lackawanna and Brie coal are unusually small
for this season of the year, and a strong effort
is being made to farther advance prices. Fish
and dried fruits met with a moderate inquiry at
former quotations. Hay was more plenty, and
Tv aP less firm in consequence. Hides were not
active as during the earlier days of tho week,
but were held with a fair degree of firmness at
11c for heavy, and at 12c for light. Leather was
active and strong. Oils, paints, tobacco, and
wood remain quiet as previously quoted.
Lumber was in moderate request, with prices
ruling steady. Erick, lime, cement, etc., were
quiet and unchanged; the demand is very light,
and only for those materials immediately need
ed. Cooperage is in tolerably fair request. Iron
and steel, metals and tinners’ stock, remain
without further change. Nails have declined,
now quoted at 65.87>£@G.00 as a basis. Salt
was fairly active at the recent advance; coarse
and fine grades now quoted at 62.40. The wool
market is without material change; the demand
is good, as compared with that of the preceding
week. Tho receipts are fair, hut a good deal of
wool is being shipped, and stocks are not really
accumulating. Prices are a*.shade easier, but
without quotable change. Hops are in moderate
demand and firmer; prime Wisconsin now
quoted at 35c. Seeds were quiet to-day, and
without change. Potatoes are in rather better
supply and in good demand at Gs@7sc in car lots.
Pomtry was rather quiet; there was some in
quiry for choice turkeys, with few offerings.
Chickens are plenty and dull; the best quotable
at $2.00@3.25, Game was plenty; ducks,
chickens, and quail in very fair demand among
shippers. Venison was in very liberal supply,
and sold slowly at B®9c per lb for carcass; sad
dies, 16@lSc. Apples were in fair demand.
Shipments are being mad© to some extent, when
the distance is snort.
Highwmea were in rather bettor demand, and
higher, though quoted inactive in New
York. Sales were reported of 200 brla at 83% c,
and GO brls at per gallon. The market
closed with holders at 6S3^c.
Dressed hogs were quiet and steady. Sales
were reported of 75 head in three lota at $4.50
per 100 lbs. Butchers generally refuse to pay
more than that figure, and that bid does not
bring tho hogs forward freely. niAy 223 head
were reported in this morning.
Provisions were quiet, but with a shade firmer
feeling, though no decided advance in prices.
Hogs at tho StockYards wore quoted 10c per 100
lbs higher, and this fact caused a few parties to
bid tho quotations of yesterday, but buyers were
not numerous, and the market closed dull, with
lard quite weak. _ The situation in provisions is
now very much like that in com for sometime
past. Prices are so low that one side is afraid
to go short to any considerable extent, lost the
market should turn sharply against them; and
buyers are equally scary about taking hold, for
fear that tho liberal receipts of hogs should pro
duce a further decline. The impression has
gained ground somehow that 8%0 per lb
should be the ruling price for" hogs in
this market this winter, and there
is little hope of activity until the
market either touches that point, or its tone is
established at some figure above it so firmly
that operators will bo satisfied tho market has
really touched bottom. Neither of these condi
tions exists yet, and tho consequence is that our
provision market is about the dullest
over known at this season of tho year.
The market closed at tho following range of
prices: Mess Pork—Old at $12.75@13.00; new
pork,cash or seller the month, at $11.75@11,87%;
do seller January, $11,75; do seller Feb

$12.00; 750 tes lard at 7%c ; 100 kegs do
(choice) at 8c; 250 tea do seller March at $7.60
per 100 lbs ; 200 boxes shoulders at 4c ; 20,000
lbs green rough sides at 4J4 ; 200 boxes short
ribs at 6c; 150 boxes short clear at 6%c : 3,000
pcs green hams (16 lbs) at 7c; 5,000 pcs do
seller January (15 lbs) at 7%c ; 50 tea sweet
pickled bellies at 7c ; 300 brls tallow at 7%0 ; 20
brls do (country) at 7%c.
Flour was in fair request from buyers for
shipment, as well as for the local trade, good
spring extras being in most demand. Former
quotations were generally bid, but some holders
asked more, and this difference of views tended
to restrict trading. Buckwheat was easier, and
bran again lower. Sales include 300 brls white
winter extras on private terms; 50 brls spring
extras (Conqueror) at $7.50; 200 brls ao at
$6.40; 200 brls do at $6.25; 100 brls do at $6.00;
100 brls do at $5.90; 400 brls on private terms;
200 bols rye on private terms; 57 brls buck
wheat at 87.8734; 120 brls do at $7.75 ; 23 brls
do on private terms. Total, 1,752 brls ; also, 60
tons bran, at $ll.OO ; 10 tons do at $10.50; all on
track. Tho following is the range of prices:
Fair to choice •winter extras $7.50® 9.75

Good to choice spring extras 5.50® 6.50

Wheat was in rather better demand, though
not active, and averaged a shade higher, New
York being firmer, especially towards tho close.
There was a much better demand for car lota for
shipment, and all the current receipts of car
lots were freely taken, North Side houses being
discriminated against, as for some time past.
Options wore in fair demand from the local spec
ulative clement, but there were very few out
side orders on tue floor. The fact is that, since
tho country speculators were so unmercifully
squeezed by the comers of last summer, they
have fought very shy of the Chicago grain mar
kets, so that a great many brokers who used to
do a fair business on country orders have now to
lie back and look on, unless the? choose to spec
ulate on their own hook. Hence wo shall prob
ably have a very quiet winter in wheat. Seller

Com -was very quiet, but firm, and averaged a
shade higher than yeacorday, in sympathy with
New York. There was very little demand for
anything, but the receipts were relatively light,
only increasing our stock in store to the extent
of about 10,000 bn, and holders offered very
little. Hence the few shorts who wanted to fill
wore obliged to accede to the demands of sellers.
As in the case of wheat, there were no outside
orders,on the floor to buy, and there were few
to sell, because present prices are not very
tempting, and country holders feel that at least
they cannot lose much by waiting a little while
before sending in their grain. Seller the month,

Tho Oregon Bulletin has tho following: Wo
can now very safely estimate what \dii be the
wheat surplus of Oregon. Adding tho amount
of wheat received so far this season here from
the interior to the estimated amount in tho
interior that will have to he explored, and
we obtain a surplus of 90,000 tons. In this is
included 7.500 tons of last year’s wheat not sold
at tho commencement of the season. Of the
90,000 tons about 20,000 tons will bo manufac
tured into flour and exported, leaving 70,000 tons
to be shipped in tho grain. There have been
loaded, so for this season, five vessels carrying
96,920 centals of wheat, equal to 4,846 tons;
there are, on tho berth, loading with wheat,
three vessels capable of carrying about 3,200
tons, which, with the amount previously ex
ported, make a total of about 8,000 tons, leav
ing 62,000 tons here. To market this amount
we require all of fifty vessels of the average size
that seek our port, but if of no larger
average than tho five loaded here this
season, then wo will require fifty-two ves
sels; but the difference is so small that it is not
worth mentioning. The above estimate isbaaed
upon tho opinion that our millers will export
over 66.000 brls of ffour. and for that amount

will consume 20,000 tons of wheat; but if they
are unable to obtain a market in California and
elsewhere for their manufacture, at remunera
tive rates, then the amount of wheat to he ex
ported in grain will he larger than above given,
as tho millers will not manufacture so much
floor, and of course more vessels will he re
quired to market tho same. 'Wo have made two
shipments of flour direct to China, which is all
that will bo exported direct from hero under six
months to come, and the San Francisco market
appears to he in a poor condition for heavy ship
ments, owing to the limited export demand now
ruling in that city.

SALT.
Tho Saginaw Courier says ;
Tho salt market is quiet and there are no especial
features to note. Several sales have been made in
Bay County, at about $1.50, and there is now, we un
derstand, but very little salt on hand unsold in that
county. The early and rather sudden closing of navi
gation left a larger quantity of salt on the river than
would have been the case had navigation closed ten
day’s later, as was anticipated would be the case by
several largo shippers who had a quantity of salt ready
for shipment, expecting vessels to load. As it is, the
amount is considerably smaller than last year, with the
prospect of a further decrease before tho opening of
navigation next spring. From George W. Hill, Deputy
Salt Inspector, we leam that thcro is on hand on the
river 102,413 barrels. Of tho amount on band it is es
timated that from 25,000 to 30,000 barrels, mostly in
Bay County, are sold, leaving, perhaps 75,000 barrels
on hand unsold. There are, however, some fifteen
works on tho river that have one and two blocks in
operation, and will run tho whole or the greater part
of tho winter,
LATEST.
In the afternoon wheat was fairly active and
He higher. No. 2 spring sold at $1.10%@1.103£,

HOPS—This market is firmer. Prime ‘Wisconsin are
now quoted at 33c, Prices are ranging higher in New
York, choice being quoted at 40045 c. Careful esti
mates show that there are now only abont 1,500 bales

try dealers. Tho stocks here are not large. The de
mand is tolerably fair, although buyers are not laying
in large supplies. We quote: Eastern, 35040 c;
prime Wisconsin, 33c; common to medium, 25@28c.
HONEY—There is a very good demand for prime
grades, with exceedingly limited offerings. Strained

strained, 12>r@lCc.

CATTLE—The market was slightly more ac
tive than on the preceding days of the week,
and for most descriptions a firmer feeling ob
tained. The exceptions were common thin na
tives and poor Texans, the too liberal supply of
which prevented any improvement in such. The
offerings embraced a better average class of
stock than usual, but the quality, after all, was
not up to the requirements of the trade, and the
market cannot be said to have been in a satisfac
tory condition. The better grades were taken
on New York, Albany, and Boston acconnt t at
$5.00@5.25 for medium to good steers averaging
from 1,150 to 1,250 lbs, at $5.50@5.75 for good
to choice steers, averaging from 1,250 to 1,300
lbs, and at 56.00@6.23 for choice to extra steers
averaging from 1,350 to 1,440 tbs. The outside quo
tation was obtained by waUwork & Sunderland,
Among the arrivals were some Christmas beovea.
one bunch of which (10 in number) was held at
SIO.OO per 100 lbs. 1m offer of $8 was refused.
The drove will probably be sent East on owner’s
account. The demand for stock cattle contin
ues steadily fair at about former rates, or at
$2.75@3.00 for common, at $3.25@3.50 for
medium to fair lots lots, and at53.75@3.00 for
good to prime. All desirable offerings were
picked up at tho'above r&ngo. Butchers* stuff,
including common cows, scaUawag steers, old
oxen, and light thin heifers were dull and neg
lected, and holders were only able to realize by
accepting such prices as buyers had the mag
nanimity to offer. Calves were also extremely
slow of sale, buyers refusing to pay over
$3.50@4.00 for common, and $4.50@5.50 for
good to choice. The market closed quiet for all
grades.

HOGS—-The market •was active and strong.
The receipts •were again large (reaching some
20,000 head), but local audoutsidehuyersoperat
ed on a liberal scale, and at the close of trade
comparatively few hogs remained in the pens
unsold, sales having been made at $3.70@3.75
for common; $3.80@3.85 for medium, and at
$3.90@4.00 for goodto choice, —indicating an ad
vance of 5c as compared with yesterday’s prices,
or an advance of 10c since Tuesday. As there
is nothing in the surroundings of the market to
■warrant the present upward movement, the ob
ject of buyers in paying these higher prices, it
may be inferred, is to influence next week’s sup
ply. Two or three assorted lots were taken
early at $-1.10, hut moat of the day’s business
was done at $3.85@3.95. We append the fol
lowing:

$4.25(35.00 for good to choice. There was some

MILL, LUMBER ANDIRON NOTES.
There will be about 130,000,000 feet of lumber
manufactured at Grand Haven, Perrysburg, and
Spring Lake this season.
—The season for lumbering operations in tho
woods has commenced in good earnest through
out the various sections of Michigan, Wisconsin,
and other States. In Michigan the prospect is
that a large crop will be cut for the next season's
manufacture, though it is not probable that the
quantity will exceed that cat last winter, as there
are many logs to lay over for want of capacity in
our Tnills to manufacture beyond a certain limit.
We give below an estimate of the quantity
of logs proposed to be put in this season by the
parties named:

BHTPWEECKS —DISASTEB3 ON LAKE SUPEEIOB.
Marquette, Mich., Dec. 4.— The iron steam
ship China, which left here for Buffalo on the
SOth, has just returned from the Sault St. Marie,
bringing over 400 sailors and steamboatmen,
and reports the moat terrible and heartrending
list of marine disasters ever known on tbia
lake. Among the worst disasters is the loss of
two new barges belonging to Eben Ward, of
Detroit, which left Marquette in tow of tbo
steamer Dix, formerly a United States rev
enue cutter. When near Whitehall Point*
the sea became so heavy that the Dix was
obliged to let go her barges, both of which
foundered with every aoul on board. The Dix
narrowly escaped, and was completely enveloped
in ice when she reached the harbor at Sault Ca
nal. The schooners Griswold and Brown are
reported lost with ail hands on board. The baric
Golden Buie floated helpless for twenty-four
hours, with canvas gone and deck and aides cov
ered aolid with ice. Her crew are badly frozen.
She was in sight of the Sanlt for several hours
with her flag at half-mast, and finally drifted
ashore. Her captain is among the number badly
frozen. The veaiel was towed into the harbor
and is safe. A schooner is asore near Point au
Pina (?), supposed to be the Middlesex. Nothing
is known as to her crew or condition. The epara
of an unknown vessel were seen at Gross Capo.
The iron steamer Japan narrowly escaped ship
wreck. She labored heavily in the sea for some
hours, rolling terribly and smashing furniture
and freight. The steamer Arizona had a hard
time, and lost her load of flour. The steamer
St. Lonis labored heavily and lost some freight.
Other vessels are known to have been,
outside which have not been heard from,
and it is feared that further disasters will coma
to light. The snow and ice in the canal is nine
feet thick. All the vessels and steamers in the
fleet experienced heavy weather and suffered
badly from ico and cold. The following steam
ers are known to he frozen in at the Sanlt and.
Mud Lake; St. Louis, Japan, St. Paul, Atlantic,
Fay, Arizona, Peerless, Cuyahoga, Dix, Norman,
Truesdell, and Menominee. Of the fleet of Tea
sels it may be learned that the Escanaba,
Cambridge, Farwell, and Golden Buie
are frozen in. A portion of the fleet which left
this port before the blow began put in at Grand
Island, and arc safely laid up there. Among
them are the steamers Mineral Bock, Tuttle,
Ely, and a number of sail vessels. Twelve ves--
aela are laid up for the winter in this port. Tna
steamer Arctic ia frozen in at Portage Lake.
The steamer Arcadia is over-due from Silver
Isle, and has not been heard from. The China,
will probably lay up hero.
