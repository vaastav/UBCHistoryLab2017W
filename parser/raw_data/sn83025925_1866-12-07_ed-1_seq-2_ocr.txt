John II. Surratt,
' m Ha Trilune.
Nearly eighteen month havo passed since the
!?nih of the principal couptrator In the
4i si;siuaUon of Abraham Lincoln, and utiJl the
lot nniams a mystery. A bright theatre
nviu leaping on the scene-a wounded man at
Jjay iu a Virginia baru, defying his pursuer,

Lis ti Toat the secret consultations of mur
dcreio, coming aud going under various names
.and diguises thcFe are the figures in that ter
rible picture, in which, like those of Rembrandt,
vast shadows enshroud a fierce and lurid light.
The galloiv, with four corpses, and one of them
a woman -the Dry Tortugas, where four con
victs expiate In wretched solitude their crimes
a quiet erave far away in IllinoU lhe9e are its
companion pictures, aud jet there is one more
len.o.e. It is that of a muu flying from the
Jaud w here he was bom; (lying from tue avenger
ix-aih, nom the body ot his victim, from the
eorpne i his mother on the si-all'old, seeking in
vain to l) v himself iu the great world, and to
blot his name from the memory of man. This
is John Harrison Surratt, of whose equal guilt
iu the crime there is no doubt, and by whom,
it is believed, much that is hidden may be
levealcd.
The evidence tnkf n before the military com
imlss.on in June, 1805, proved John H. Surratt
to be one of the principal conspirators. It was
at the liou-e of his mother that the mcutiugs
werp held; up to the week of the assassination
lie had been journcytr.g between Richmond and
31 out real ; Booth was his constant compnniou;
Mud1 concealed him iu the woods near bis
house; Payne consulted with him; Atzerodt
confessed that Surratt induced him to join the
conspiracy; one Nott, a Rebel, when he heard
Ot the murder, it was sworn, exclaimed: "My
Uod John Surratt knew all about this, and do
you f uppose he is going to slay iu Washington,
ud let them catch him'? liis name was the
Jirt in the. indictment. Had there been any
doubt cf Lis guilt, his flight would havo re
moved it, tor though none of the principals
were more frequently seen ;) to the 3a of
April, on the afternoon of the lt'.b. he was
Been tor the last time, booted and spurred,
leady tor his escape. From that time the very
existence of John Surratt was a mystery; it
was believed he was dead; that he bad re
vealed ttio names of his fellow-conspirators to
Ihe Government, and had been allowed to
escape; that he was secretly imprisoned. It
was noted that no rewaid was offered for his
finest. Yet, as time passed on, John Surratt
was torg tten, till the other day came the
Ctartlmg news that he had been arrested by the
American Consul-General iu Egypt.
- De yuuicey, in illustration ot the vast empire
ind power ot the Romans, imagines a fugitive
Siow the veneeance of the Emperor vainly seek
5ng to escape his ernip. North, South, East, or
'West, wta-rever the wretched man may ny, he
lreails wtth'n the circle of Rome, aud her hand is
Raised above him; ttuuehbe fly to the uttermost
parts of the earth, Ctvsar will be before him.
In this age, jsstice is as hard to escape. The
great criminal hides in vain in lorcign lands,
changes his name or disguises his person. Sur
Tatt's per son was not very easy to disguise. A
tall man, with a prominent forehead and very
large uo e, with deeply sunken eyes and long
biack tmir. Thus he wai described at the trial.
Of his wanderings, little is known. It is said
that be was recognised on a Liverpool steamer
shortly after the murder. Then came tbe rumor
that he was serving as a private soldier in the
Pope's Guards at Rome. We know now that he
had been, a sold it r in the Papal Zouaves at
Veroli, and served under the name of John
Watson. The tact became known to Mr. Rulus
King, our Minister at Rome, who telegraphed
to o'ir Government, and was instructed to
fiecti; his arrest. Mr. King conferred with
Oni viiual Antonelli, whe issued an order for his
eei.'e. . Surratt was taken; he was imprisoned;
ftiri on removal from jail, guarded by live
so i' ners, broke from tneir nanas, j urn pea, n is
catd, over a precipice more than one hundred
foe' nteh, and escaped into the Italian territory.
Mr. Marsh, our Minister at Florence, obtained
telcorraphic instructions from the ltaliau Gov
cri, ueut to have all the seaports of Italy
r i-hed to prevent his escape.
lie was soon supposed to have embarkei in a
fcler.mer for Malta, aud a de-patch to that Island
Arrived too late to detain him; another was
Bent to Alexandria, and when Surratt stepped
upon the shotes of Egypt, he was seizefby the
Strong, far-reaching arm of America. United
States detectives, it is said, have watched him
eince October. Rut long before this he must
have been overtaken by a speedier, surer foe.
Fear was ever at his back; Irom remorse he
could hardly escape, lor even tf he could forget
the crime he had committed, how could he
ever cease to see the phantom of his mother on
thepaliows? Coward all the world believed
him, since that day when he fled and left her to
Buffer; a coward, it was said, she held him, aud
in ber last moments refused to hear his na ne.
There is true dramatic interest in this imoer
Ject history. The escape and pursuit of no
Other criminal in this ctntury has so much to
excite the imagination. No man, it is possiole,
not even Bootn, worked harder to accomplish
the murder; and a deeper interest Is given to
his share In the conspiracy by his frequent jour
seya to Richmond. Upon Surratt's presumed
conneotiouwvth the Rebel Government, Andre
Johnson charged Jetierson Davis who com
plicity in the assassination. Ne revelations
are expected from his trial; the public may be
disappointed in that, yet if John 11. Surratt
could be induced to confess, before the death
which is almost certain to be his late, there is
no reasonable doubt but that he nimht tell the
whole story of Lincoln's assassination from the
begiunlng to the end.
The Vloleuco of Congress.
from the World.
. The proceedings ot Congress, during the four
laB it bas been In sesion, evince all the rancor
olfaction, but none of the grave wisdom which
eSU the supreme council of the natlou. It is
Conscious weakness, not couscious strength,
Ibat breaks out in such intemperate ebullitions
What can the Republicans expect to gain by
the iLdecent haste of their demonstrations
against the President ? Why should the very
first day of the session have been selected for
Starting a bill for tho assembling of the Fortieth
Congress on the 5th of March? If such a bill
should be pas.-ed the last week in February it
would bo equally efficient; and the broaching it
tot this early day is such an exhibition of un
dignified afld Incontinent spite as must lower
that body in the estimation of considerate men.
Its hot Impatience to repeal the amnesty clause
of the confiscation act U equally needless, ex
cept as a display ot ungovernable petulanee.
There was no likelihood that the President
lnteuced any further pardons at present. He
has for some time steadiij' refused to Kraut any
and it' be bad attached any importune to the
bection about to be repealed, he could easily
Jbave forestalled and frustrated this movement
by an amnesty before tbo meeting of Congress.
It was contrary to all probability that he in
tended to issue any pardons during tho first
month of the session. Cougress has therefore
acted more in tbe spirit of a weak, scoldiug
woman, whose wrath torments her till sho has
fiven it vent, than like a body of self poised
eglslators. Their attempt to curb the appoint
ing power of the President is open to the same
jrtticMrv
The President tins made ail the removals he
thoucht export cut; and dining the ensuing
lour months every appointment must bj sub
uil'tcd to the H nute mr confirmation be'bre it
cimtake effect. Kven if a restraint upon the
nppo.uting power were necc68ary( U requires
no immediate baste; and if the bill passes lor
convening the Fortieth Congress on tho 6th of
March, the Senate will be in oerpetual sesiou,
and kuprrsede the ncce-lty oi any othr check.
Blind, lieadl jng impulse, aud precipitate wrath,
not cool reflection and sober Judgment, control
the proceedings ol Conwcs..
We should not have w itnessed these spler.etlc
exhibitions tf the Republicans were not secretly
conscious of their impotence. They know well
enough that Conre-s Is merely a leirisl ilive,
not nn executive body. The laws it passes will
not execute ihemselve, and no laws can be en
forced iu tho South except by officers already
contiimcd by tne Senate. The recent removals
have all been in the North, and neither the
Senate nor Congress can turn out any officer
who has been confirmed. The North will get on
well enough whether Mr. Johnson's recent and
unconfirmed appointees are displaced or re
tained: and Federal officers in the South are not
likely to enforce clearly unconstitutional laws.
Concrete could, indeed, rcmovo such officers by
impeachment; but as every person impeached is
entitled to a trial, with ample opportunities of
delense, the Southern officers could not be all
deposed in this way before the new-born babes
ol the present year grew to be men.
Even if ttie radicals should adopt the mort
extreme measure which has yet been broached
that of declaring the States to be Territories
and prescribing Territorial Governments for
them it would' practically amount to nothing.
The constitutionality ot such a law would be at
orce contested in the Supreme Coutt, which is
already committed on that subject, and would
be boiind by its own lecont precedents. If Con
press declares the States to be Territories, or if
it assumes that tho ratifications of les3 than
three-lourths of the whole number will suffice
lor Constitutional amendments, the only conse
quence will be that the Supreme Court will de
clare such legislation void, and the whole sub
ject will revert Into its present shape.
The President is calm, confident, and assured,
because he has measured the power of his oppo
nents, and knows that they have exhausted all
their resources of hostility, except such as tho
Supreme Court will adiudge unconstitutional.
Congress vapors and blusters because it sees
that it has no effectual power, and that, unless
it can torrify the South by bravado, it has gone
to the length of its tether.
Tlie First Steps of Congress Towards
Southtru Ki'Htorullou.
From the IleraUI.
In the House of Representatives on Tuesday
last there were two independent propositions
adopted, looking to the reconstruction and res
toration of the excluded Southern States. We
may say they were of the highest importance,
as indicating a two-third vote in favor ot a com
prehensive reconstruction, embracing the reor
ganization of the States concerned from the
disorganized condition in which they 6tood
when first di.-armed as members of a hostile
confederacy.
The first of these propositions was in the
shape ot a resolution Irom Mr. Wentworth, of
Illinois, to this etlect that in respon-e to the
President's Message on the status of the lately
insurgent Slates, still excluded from Congress,
"the House finds in their many acts of disloyalty
luoe itM inat adjournment, as well as In the
recent elections in the iOJai states, additional
reasons lor insisting on the adopUon ol the
pending Constitutional amendment belore it
will consider the propriety of giving such
States Corgi essional lepresentation." Mr. An
coua (Democrat), of Pennsylvania, moved to
lay this resolution on the table, and the yeas
and nays being ordered, the call resulted yeas
thirty-two, nays one hundred and nineteen,
wbeieupon the resolution was adopted without
a division. It will thus be seen that nearly
four-filths of the House are in favor of adhering
to the amend in end as a basis of Southern resto
ration. We may conclude, therefore, that as
the next Congiess, lately elected, is substan
tially the present Congress over again, this
resolution is fixed to the 4lb of March, 186!), and
covers the question whether the excluded States
shall or shall not be admitted into the Presiden
tial election of 1868.
This is a matter worth considering by the un
recognized Stares; for it is morally certain that,
unless their balance of power is brought into
the scales, the approaching Presidential election
win result in anotner lease ot power to tne
dominaut party, executive as well as legisla
tive. Rut the second nrooosition to which we
have reieired aims at the cutting out of these
boutneru embarrassments by the root, it was
put 'nine torm ot a resolution irom Air. liroomaii
i t Pennsylvania, instructing the Committee on
Tetritories "lo inquire into the expediency of
reporting a oin provioine Territorial Govern
ments for the several districts of country within
ihe jurisdiction of the United States lormerly
occupied by the once existing Slates of Virginia,
Noith Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alaoaraa,
Mifsissippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas,
and giving to all adult maleinhabitants therein,
born within the limits ot the United States, or
duly naturalized, and not participants in the
late Rebellion, full equal rights in such Terri
torial Governments."
This sweeping proposition was adopted yeas
one hundred and seven, nays thirty -seven a
vote of nearly three-fourths oi the House. To
be sare, this is a mere inquiry ordered, but the
vote indicates the opinion and, probably, the
fixed purposp ot both Houses. The bill, we ex
pect, will in due season be reportel, and from
mis preliminary vote we inter, that, if put to the
test, it can be passed over the Piesident's veto,
when it will be a law of the land. We believe,
however, that it iu the meantime tho excluded
State6, even as now orgauized, adopt tbe pend
ing Constitutional amendment, and sliupe their
local Governments and Congressional elections
so as to meet its coalitions, tbey will be id
mitted into Congress aiter the example of len
l.estec. It is because of the intractable and
debant spirit muni letted by the ruling politicians
of the States concerned, that Mr. Brooraall pro
poses the extreme remedv ot reducing them not
only to the tondi iou of Territories, but to tbe
control of their blick population. Think of
that aScutb Carolina Territorial Legislature
of blacks making laws tor Wade Hamilton.
It is between this extreme and awful remedy
and tbe Constitutional amendment that the un
reconciled States have to choose a choice of a
salivating treatment of calomel and jalap, or a
Uttl of the sweet spirits of nitre with so'ne
tincture of rhubarb. Nar can we promise that
any very long maipla of time will bo allowed
for a decision upou the subject. We seriously
entertain the opinion, nevertheless, that if
South Carolina, tor example, within a month or
two shall adoot the amendment and Irame her
local institutions and ber elections accordingly,
tdie will be restored as a State without being
su bjected to this threatened territorial ordeal.
The warnings which wehaveso repeatedly given
the States and people concerned are now reduced
to "a fixed tact." Nothing better will be offered
them than the Constitutional amendment, and
if it is not very soon accepted something m uch
worse will assuredly iollow.
Reorgnulzatiou at the South.
From the Tim$.
Tbe unsatisfactory condition of affairs at thd
South is established by the reports of the mili
tary commanders stationed there. To many of
the statements emanating from that section,
respecting outrages upon freedmen, and other
evidence of aversion to Federal control, we have
paid little attention, believing that they were
colored, if not in vente l, lor partisan purposes.
But to tbe representations made by our military
authorities in the Southern States uo suspicion
can posblbly attach. Whatever be their opi
nions on oontroveite i political questions, at any
rate they are responsible and impartial. They
enjoy the well-earned cmbdeuoe ol the loyal
people of the lnd, and their averments will
undoubtedly be accepted as conslustve on ques
tions of (act.
On the important fact touching the treat
ment of the Irrednicn, the testimony ot the
Generals is positive and unfavorable. An idea
has obtained that South Caroline his dono itself
honor by tho fullness of Its provisions tor jus
tice to the colored pedple. General Sickles,
however, reports that in some districts of the
State the ireednian Is dependent upou the pre
sence and protection ot national U-oops (or
' security for life, lunb, or property." A pre
vailing iudipposition to prosecute, aud a failure
to puuit-li oilonders, when negroes are the suf
trrers, is Imputed to the local authorities; and
au cxtraoroiuarv 8tate enactment is cited, under
which militia vfbecru may "disperse, suppress,
kill, and destroy any company 6f freedmen or
otheiswho shall be found lurking in any sus
pected place where they may do mischief."
From Kentucky General Davis reports an in-crea-c
ol lawlessness since the triumph of Rcoel
candidates at the election. General Wood,
writing irom MissIpbIt pi, shows thnt laws re
main in (orce piohl'utmg freednie?i from pur
chasing real estnte, aud that only lreed
nien who have obtained special licence are pet
mitted to bear arms. The interior local autho
rities, too, arc slow to proceed against Rebel
ofieudcrs, who usually escape 'unpunished.
General Sheridan, referring to affairs in Texas,
speaks yet more positively. There, the GenorJ
remarks, "the trial of a white man for tho
murder of a tieedman would be a farce." And
while a great outcry is Taised when a single
white bettler is kilk-d by Indians, "over the
killing of many frcedcueu in the settlements
nothing is done."
Again, Arkansas has been singled1 out as by
comparison a reconstructed Stute. It sent loyal
men to Washington last winter, and has
seemed to be laraely impreenated with North
cm influences. Encouraged, probably, by the
position assumed by the President, and the
greater degree ol boldness which distinguishes
the tone of Southern politicians on national
allairs, the Rebel clement In Arkansas has
asserted its right to rule. Governor Murphy is
not an extreme man, as tbe manner in which he
presented the Constitutional amendment to the
local Legislature for ratidcation proved. Apart
Irom bim, the State Government is once more
in Rebel hands. The three members of Congress
elect were chosen because of the support they
pave to the Rebellion; the State ollicers, with
the exception of tho Executive chair, have been
assigned to conspicuous Rebels; a lare majo
rity of the Legislature belong to the same
cluss; and all the counties save three have given
their minor local offices to men who have waged
war ugainrt the Government. The Union men
of the State propose ta meet in convention to
petition Cotgrcss tor a grant of the same
powers whicu were entrusted to them three
cars ago, w hen the work ot reconotructlon on
Its present basis was undertaken. The men
who co-operated with Mr. Lincoln then a-k now
for power to begin anew, with the light of re
cent experience to guide ihem. The mere issue
of the call tor a gathering to petition has
aroused the ire of the Rebels in tbe State Legis
lature, who have talKed of legislation to aid tbe
Governor in suppressing the "movement. Forci
ble suppression, after the style in vogue at New
Orleans, is buret I y likely to be attempted. Aud
the Unionists, we presume, will make them
selves heard at Washington.
North Carolina seems no nearer bona fide re
construction than other parts ot tbe South. The
election of an ultra secessionist, Judge Manly, to
the United States Senate, illustrates tbe pre
dominant temper of the Legislature. Ex-Governor
Hidden one of President Johnson's ap
pointees dccluies, in ihe Raleigh standard, of
which he is the editor, that the Provisional Gov
ernment experiment has been a failure; that
"the President was deceived, and bis Provisional
fiovwnora weio oecoived;'' that "all hope that
existing Southern orpaiiiKatioii will concur in
measures necessary 10 restoro the Southern
States to the Union is nt an end;" and that
"there is nothing left but to reorganize the
Southern States." For this conclusion the repre
sented Slates may not be fully prepared. But
the expression ot such an opinion in sued a
quarter is a sign ot the times not to be over
looked, while the tacts we havo collated may
help to lamiharize us with the outlines ot the
Southern position.
That anything short cf the surrender of the
Union pwrty and principle will satisfy the pie
tent leadeis of Southern opinion, we do not
believe. Even President Johnson does not
satisfy them; for, though oppoeed to the Consti
tutional amendment, the language of bis Mes
sage commits him to the support of the test
oath. Dut the South will have neither. It
refuses to latily tbe amendment, and it demands
the admission to Congress of whomsoever it may
choose to send, Rebel or no Rebel. "We utterly
reject his test oath," is the answer of the Rich
mond Examiner a journal which, under its
present management, is one of the most efficient
exponents of Southern opinion. "We think the
South would rather btay out of Conciessi indefi
nitely" than be represented by persons who
would swallow tbe oath, is tbe statement with
w hlch the M arniner disposes of Mr. Johnson's
safeguard. It is evident, therefore, that the
amendment i not the obstacle to restoration.
The real obstacle Is the avetsion of the Southern
politicians to everything calculated to insure
the peace and Integrity of the nation. Tbey
require that they should dictate terms before
resuming their places in the Union.
