BRIEF APPEAL
TO SANTA CLAUS
MASTER ' HARRY ASHBAUGH
WANTS SOME TOYS.
LEAVES IT TO SANTA
Little Billings Boy Relies on Santa
Claus and Just Writes a Terse Note
in Which He States That He Wants.
Some Toys.
From Thursday's Daily.
Harry Ashbaugh places entire faith
in Santa Claus. He is not a particu
lar kind of a boy and firmly believes
that Santa will do what is right and
just.
Yesterday the local postoffice re
ceived a letter addressed: "To Santa
Claus, North Pole," And the letter
enclosed was brief and to the point.
He says:
"Dear Santa:
"Please bring me some toys.
"Harry Ashbaugh."
It isbelieved that -Harry's appeal
will be listened to as the note was for
warded by the postal authorities to
the North Pole, and when Santa Claus
comes to Billings, he surely cannot
overlook such a nice little boy, as
Harry must' be.
Then too, he should be impressed
by the. whole-souled confidence of the
little man, who does not go into de
tail, but just wants "some toys" and
knows that he will get pretty things.
Harry failed to give his home ad
dress, but old Santa has a way of
finding the addresses. of, good little
boys and he will undoubtedly come to
Harry's home and fill his stocking
with pretty toys if he will go to bed
and trust his patron saint as, implicit
ly as he has done.
Later, a little bird in its flight, left
word that if ISanta Claus will visit the
Montana Nursery, he will have no
trouble in finding Harry, for he, is
known there as a very good little boy
whom Santa Claus in his hurry Christ
mas night, should not overlook. Has
ry's mother cooks for the.nursery.

DRINKS PINT OF
WHISKEY ON BET
GOT $2 FOR DRINKING THE FIERY
JUICE.
ROW AT TtEl DEPOT
Was Created by Frank Rosella, an
Italian, Who Made a Pitiful Plea to
Judge Mann, Who Decided to Ex
cuse Him This Time.
From Thursday's Daily.
Yesterday morning Judge F. L.
Mann, had two descendants of sunny
Italy before him when he opened
court. One was let or on nis promise
to be good in the future and the other
' one was fined.
Julius Sasick, an Italian, who was
arrested at the Billings postoffice
where he created a disturbance, told
the judge about how he became drunk.
From the story told by Sasick, it
seems that he had been out drinking
with a few Italian friends and after
getting real mellow on "vinto tinta,"
one of the crowd bet him that he
could drink a pint of whiskey,
without taking the bottle from his
lips.
A wager of $2.00 was put up and
Sasick won the wager, but he was
very drunk, when he finished.
"I no likaa the whis' judga," ex
plained the Italian who does not
speak overly good English, but it
seemed that on this occasion he was
after the money.
Sasick had some money which he
expected to. be at the postoffice and
he went after it. In fact he went
after it so hard that he was arrested
and the $2 which he won and three
more were paid out in the police
Frank Rosella, who says he sells
bread, and who got in trouble at the
depot, made a pitiful plea to the
judge. He was arrested by Officers
Sage and Bakke, who booked him on
the charge of drunk and disorderly.
He begged so hard that Judge Mann
told him that he would let him go this
time, but that if he ever came up 4
again he would get the limit.
Jas. J. McCormick, put up a bond of e
$15 on a charge of disturbing the
peace and being drunk, and his case
will come up later.

EDITOR ONES
BOOSTS LOVELL
INORTHERN WYOMING TOWN HAS
GREAT POSSIBILITIES.
NEW DITCH COMPLETED
Fifty Thousand Acres in Vicinity Un
der Irrigation-Sugar Factory and
Oil Refinery, He Says, Will Soon be
Erected at Lovell.
From Wednesday's Daily.
Luvell is the coming town of north
ern Wyoming, according to Editor
W. M. Jones of the Lovell Chronicle,
who was in Billings yesterday.
"Last week the water was turned
in for the first time into the Coopera
tive canal, which will irrigate 1,800
acres in the vicinity of Lovell, and
the entire flat is now covered with
water for irrigation purposes. Within
a short distance of Lovell there are
under irrigation more than 50,000
acres and much more that is capable
ot cultivation," said Mr. Jones.
"The growing of sugar beets has
proved a very lucrative proposition to
the northern Wyoming farmers. Dur
ing the past season 1,700 acres of
beets were cultivated and the yield
ran from 12 to 20 tons per acre, de
pending upon the amount of attention
given the crop. Experts declare that
Lovell is situated in one of the finest
beet growing sections of the nation.
"It is practically certain that a beet
sugar factory will be built in Lovell. A
canvass has shown that the acreage
of beets required to sustain a factory
can be secured in the vicinity and
thus the long haul and high freight
exacted to haul to the Billings fac
tory will be eliminated. In this res
pect the Billings factory has taught
the farmers of eastern Montana and
northern Wyoming the possibilities of
sugar beet culture and they are going
to take advantage of it.
"Lovell is also going to have an oil ]
refinery. Within seven miles of the!!
city are four flowing wells, one spout
ing about 200 barrels each day and
the others running about 100 barrels I
each. Gas can be had in unlimited i
quantities by boring, which will fur- i
nish cheap fuel. A site for the oil
refinery has already been selected
and it is to be situated on the Bur- 1
lington railroad and thus will be close
to transportation facilities."
