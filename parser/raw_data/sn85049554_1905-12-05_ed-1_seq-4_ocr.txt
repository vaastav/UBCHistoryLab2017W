Aside from this the president's
recommendations are routine. He sug
gests that some scheme should be de
vised to give the federal government
greater supervision over large corpor
ations to the end that injurious com
petition and monopoly may be prevent
ed instead of prosecuted. He would
include the insurance companies under
this federal supervision. He recom
mends changes in our currency laws
to give elasticity to our bank currency.
He would have all campaign contri
butions by corporations forbidden by
law. He would have more money spent
on airmy maneuvers so as to keep the
army in preparedness for war and he
adivises that something be done to build
lip a merchant marine so as to have
American ships and American seamen
to call upon In tiroes of war.

Theodore Roosevelt is very much of
a politician as well as a statesman of,
rare judgment. He has always been a
man of. single purpose and just now
his whole energy Is centered on rail
road rate regulation. In order that
nothing shall interfere to distract pub
lic atention from this one subject or
to turn votes away from support of the
pet project the other very possible
paramount issue of the tariff is treat*
ed almost in silence. The president
opens his message with a' congratula
tion that these times should be so pros
perous. but in the saq*e sentence he
warns the country that the tide must
turn sooner pr later. Then, In referring
to revenue, he asserts that there is
more need of stability than of the at
tempt to attain an ideal perfection In
the methods of raising revenue." His
fear seems to be that the backward
swing of the pendulum of prosperity
is about dlue and he is afraid to speak
very loud for fear of precipitating the
change. However, he does think that
the question of maximum and mini
mum schedules so as to secure reci
procity should be considered at this
session. If this much were done the
great majority of revisionists would be
satisfied but unless the president puts
himself at the head of the movement
for re-adjustment of schedules admit
tedly wrong and) injurious, it is not
likely that reciprocity, maximum and
minimum rates, or any other kind of
a tariff change will be considered by
the present congress. As the president
says, "there must be something like a
general agreement among the citizens
of the several states that the change
Is needed" before reciprocity will re
ceive serious legislative attention.
The message will repay any man for
half' an hour's time in the reading
of it.
ALDRICH AND DOLLIVER.
Writing to the Philadelphia. Ledger
its Washington correspondent fur
nishes some gossip of the capital that
will be read with interest In Iowa. Ac
cording to this correspondent:
It
came
out today that just before
Senator Aldrich, letid'er of the opposi
tion to the president, left for New York
to see wlnit, he could do to strengthen
his shattered lines, he read the riot
act to Senator Dolliver. He accused
that statesman of trying to break up
the republican party, and toid him he
must stop his foolishness and get in
Une, Io!Iiver refused to budge from
his position, and assured Aldrich that
a bill in Mne with the president's rec
oipmeitdations would1 be passed. This
proceeding on Aldrich's part carne on
the heels of his discovery that the
president controlled the interstate
commerce committee of the senate.
This revelation caused Aldrich to ad
minister the ''third degree" to Dolliver,
while on'KlWns it had the effect of
making him sue for peace.
The srectacle of Aldrich. the head
and front of corporate domination in
the senate, administering the "third
degree" to the Junior Iowa senator is
one at once displeasing and gratifying
the peoplo of the state. That Aid
rich should assume from a rotten
borough to dlotate a line of action to
a senutor from a magnificent com
monwealth like Iowa. Is sufficiently in
sulting. but it shows that Dolliver is
with the people on the overshadowing
question of rate regulation. Men are

THE PRESIDENT'^ MESSAGE.
President Roosevelt's message to
the congress this year reads very
largely like an extended Roosevelt
lermon on the great social problems of
our times, the labor problem, trust
problem, etc., but in the condensed
form as printed on the fifth page of to
day's issue, will be found very interest
ing to all. The president's words as
to rate regulation, of course, constitute
the center of interest In the whole doc
ument. but even in this there is noth
ing surprising. The "most pressing
neetV' in legislation he says to be a
law to permit agents of the govern
ment to regulate railroad rates. He
wants authority given to review an un
reasonable rate and to fix a new rate
that shall replace one found to be un
reasonable.
VPST"*
y"
he came boldly out in support of the
president. Now that Aldrich has abus
ed him there will be a wider renewal
of confidence. Men at whom senators
of the Aldrich type rage can not be
far wrong.
Senator Aldrich is a standpatter of
the sort from Standipatville. His Iowa
friends and followers can get such
comfort as they may out of the inter
view between him and the Iowa sen
ator,
IOWA RAILROADS.
In Its annual report the Iowa rail
way commission deals with a subject
near to the hearts of traveling men
and residents along the branch lines
of railroad systems in Iowa. The policy
of neglect practiced by Iowa railway
managers against these lines is severe
ly criticised by Ohe commission and
attention given inadequate and unsan
itary depots, condition of tracks and
neglect to furnish coaches to accom
modate travel at holiday times. Some
improvement is noted, but the ^com
mission insists that its recommenda
tions for branch lines shall be given
attention.
All those who have traveled widely
in Iowa will confirm the allegations
made by the commissioners. Certain
branch lines of some systems are so
neglected as to be positively danger
ous. Old rails worn out on main lines,
old ties transferred, dirty, dusty and
antiquated coaches, and a train serv
ice apparently calculated to give the
least possible satisfaction to travelers
and shippers, have long been causes
of annoyance and loss to those whose
locality or business make them depend
ent on the branch lines. And this in
the face of the fact that some of these
neglected branches have been among
the best paying mileage of the systems.
There will be general thankfulness
over the Insistence of the commission
on improvement of these conditions.
The net earnings of Iowa railroads
for the past year amounts In round
numbers to $15,000,000, nearly a mill
ion and a half less than In the previous
year. Net earnings per mile, $1,592
They employed 85,508 persons to whom

So I eaid to myself when the strong
arm of the government Is extended to
help these settlers, to shield them from
the robber farmers who occupy sites
higher up the mountains. When the
vast resources of the government can
be used to build a complete system,
when a strong central power shall
seize all these rivers and water sources
and distribute God's blessings among
all the people, for the people, when
all these little struggling plants are
made autonomous, when the best en
gineers in the world, with a Vast corps
of assistants and unlimited m&ans, are
employed in this great scheme, then
will Irrigation bring health and happi
ness and wealth to millions of people,,
and not till then.
As I looked at all the wasted
effort and the miserable pre
datory warfare, the disappointments
and the heartaches, I just felt that If it
were left to me. my Jeffersonian prin
ciples wouldn't stand in the way of a
general and equitable*system of irriga
tion under the supervision of the na
tional government, a holy minute, so,
W'hen
I wrote for the Times-Republican
a series of articles—six long letters I
think—on the National Park of the
Yellowstone, I digressed, and went out
of my way to call attention to the pos
sibilities of a national scheme of irrU
gation, and' I urged action upon the
men of the west, and I took a great
liberty for I actually promised them
that they had a strong and true friend
at court in President Roosevelt, and
I was rash enough to say that if both
houses of congress could overcome the
scrupples of prejudices of certain men
and the selfishness of certain com
munities, and could agree on a- bill,
President Roosevelt would not only
sign it,'but he would do all in his pow
er to further its passage. To be frank
about It I didn't know what President
Roosevelt's ideas on national irriga
tion were, but I knew the man's tre
mendous personality I knew how he
Uad forced the Ford franchise bill thru
a hostile legislature in New York I
knew he was a man in t'h°rouffh sym
pathy with the west and its develop
ment I knew he was gifted with rug
ged honesty and largely, with that
wonderful attribute that makes so
many men seem great—horse sense
and I was simply willing to risk my
reputation as a prophet In what he
would do if the emergency arose.
It did arise. We all recall his message
to congress in the' fall of 1901, the sub
sequent Introduction of what is pop
ularly known as the Newlandsl bill, and
how it became a law June 17, 1902.
This was quick work, but as William
Allen White said' of Cleveland, Roose
velt is a man who "does things." The
secret history of this bill is not yet
knqwn, and will not be until the his1
torian of the future shall record it. We
know some of the things that Roose
velt had to oontend with. From the
very first, he characteristically threw
himself heart and soul Into the move
ment. He found a hostile speaker.
The speaker was from the middle west
and. strange to say, the people of this
region were inclined to look askance
at any scheme that offered greater
agricultural competition. The people
of the middle west were not imbued,
to anv preni extent, with the philoB-
Irrigation In the West.
[By D. W. Norris, of Grinnell.]
When I visited the National Park of
the Yellowstone in 1901, I had occasion
to spend a few days among thie far
mers who were tilling the Irrigated
lands of Idaho and other mountain
states. I had then the most positive
evidence of the wonderful fertility of
the soil, its marvellous and almost
abnormal productiveness and I was
enthused when I contemplated the vast
possibilities of the valleys of the west.
When I saw the orude and imperfect
ditches, the waste of water, and1 the
disadvantages under which these men
worked, it occurred to me that Aladdin
was rutobing his lamp In vain, that no
adequate return could be secured un
til the paternal idea of government
could be applied to these vast areas.
When I visited California in 1902 I
observed the same fearful waste, the
same misdirected efforts, the same
lack of unity of action. In this crude,
primary system of irrigation the doc
trine of the "strong" is exemplified. It
Is the old savage thought of "take care
of one's self and the devil take the
hindmost." Just why the first comer
is the strongest, should seize and hold
the water, any more than the sun
shine or the air, or any other element
of nature, I can not understand. I had
'been educated in the atmosphere of
democracy and I havo unitll recent
years looked' with suspicion on the
gradual encroachment of "paternal
ism" In government. But no student
of men and things can shut his eyes
to the present trend. Apply Jefforson
ian principles to New York city and I
do not dou'bt it would' be one of
the .most chaotic communities on
earth, instead of one of the
most orderly, attractive and de
lightful. Gradually the Jeffersonian
principle is yielding to the march of
time. The city Is no longer a true
democracy, neither is the town, nor
the general government. Municipal
ownership and Jeffersonian democracy
will not go together. One must grow, so It
follows, the other must give way. The
same evolution is going on in the na
tional government. Every year new
And strange forms are exercised bv the
government and so used to this silent
encroachment have the people become
that it is scarcely a matter of com
ment. To use the medical department
of tlie army to fight yellow fever in
New Orleans is enough to make Jeffer
son come back, to say nothing of seiz
ing or buying a strip of land on the
Isthmus of Panama to connect the

ophy of Senator Beveridge in his "Ad
vice to Young men," President Roose
velt found a hostile chairman of the
committee to which the bill must go^
he was also from the middle west, and
he swore by the great horn spoon that
no such extravagant piece of legisla
tion should ever corne from his com
mittee. It became necessary not only
to win over the speaker, but some
means must be devised to placate
Cannon for an out and out appropria
tion from the treasury was out of the
question. Next there was the atti
tude of the eastern members
some more than Indifferent, others
hostility, especially in the senate. The
opening uip of a large area, producing
the necessaries of life did' not appeal to
them if it drew on the treasury so as
to endanger appropriations involving
personal Interests. But this remarka
ble man was equal to every emer
gency, as he has been recently in his
fight for rate control and the bill, a
just, wise and generous measure, be
came a law.
Briefly the plan ds this: The
proceeds from the sale of public
lands are held as a special fund for
purposes of irrigation. From the pas
sage of the bill until now over thirty
mil Li ions have been paid into this fund.
The peculiar feature Is that this mon
ey Is not expended permanently, it is
only loaned. The expectation is that
every inrigation plant will, within ten
years from its completion pay (back
into the fund all that 'It has cost the
fund. The engineer in charge first de
termines by a series of measurements
—and these have ibeen going on for
yPars—just how much water he can
rely on. It is then merely a question
of mathematics how many acres he
can supply with twelve or fifteen
inches of water. I mean by this
water equal to a twelve or fifteen-inch
rainfall during the season.
The next thing in order la for the
government chemists or soil experts\
to determine the nature of the soil to
be irrigated. Not all of it is good. The
white alkaH dust, resembling very
fine, white wood a»h such as is found.
in the valley of the Snake, is unex
ampled in fertility and productiveness.
All such soil is considered very de
sirable and In most valleys it Is sim
ilar- In some places there 4s found t«o
much alkali, In other places there are
many square miles of an elastic,
sandy, gummy composition, known
locally as "dobe." This is undeslraJble.
Some areas are rocky while others are
more or le«*s objectionable for vaWous
reasons. The volcanic afh Is all good,
and the 'beds of the ancient lakes like
the Carson Sink are necessarily rich.
In general the level sage brush, sandy
desert Is found to be of the very
highest order, v«ry rich, much
resembling a guano bed, but
still not too rich tor fer
tUity. In proportion as the larger
bush called grease wood prevails, the
soil deteriorates. When I speak of soil,
I do' not mean loam, such as we have
In Iowa. In the desert, the soil looks
like sand or ash. I do not know Its
depth. Here In Iowa sandy land is
worthless, there It hardly has any lim
ItatMns in productiveness. Having
determined what is desirable, that land
Is thrown open to entry. You may fil*
on M0, but the right is reserved to
limit
you
to 80 and even 40 where the
work is done, if it Is found that there
Isn't land enough to go around. The
object is to make homes, and it is be
lieved that 40 acre- highly cultivated,
will support an .average family-
When the work is done and the cost
is determined, it is easy to determine
the cost per acre. This then is divided
by 10 and the settler pays one-tenth
of Ms water ta* each year, no inter
esti It will average about $26 per
acre.1
Thus you see the money all comes
back in ten years, but it earns no In
terest, neither would It ww anything
lying in the treasury. At the end' of
ten years, the works are turned over
to what is called "The Water Users
Association," an institution attached
to each project: This association must
then, thru lta offlolals, conduct tho
plant. I suppose the cost will be met
by a nominal tax. This association
Is a part of each project from its In
ception. The reclamation act carries
with it the right of eminent domain.
The ditches already in use must of
course be abandoned. It is the work
of the Water Users' Association to as
certain the extent of the water right
already owned by each settler. Then
he signs an agreement to surrender his
right In consideration of a similar
right in the new plant. If he already
has 13-lnich water right for 40 acres,
and actually ha» that much water, he
is entitled to that much government
water, but if he owns 80 acres and
wants water for the other 40 acres
he must pay for that. Often it hap
pens that a man owns a 12*inch water
right, but only gets 8 or 9 inches. In
such cases he is entitled to free water
8 or 9 inches only. The whole plan
seems to have been well thought out
and matured deliberately and wisely.
