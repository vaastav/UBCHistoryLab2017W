Washington, Deo. 8. President Mo
Klnley sent the following message to
the Fifty-fifth congress after he bad
been Informed by committee that the
senate and house awaited any oom-
manlcatloa be wished to make to
them:
To ths Senate and Housa of Representatives:
Notwlthstandina' the added burdani rendered
aeoessarj by the war, our people rejoice In a
very satisfactory and steadily inoreaslnif de
cree of prosperity evidenced by the lariri-st
Tolume of bualnessever recorded. Every man
ufacture ban been productive, acrleullurnl pur
aula hae yielded abundant return, labor In
the Bold of Industry Is better rewarded, rev
enue legislation passed by the present congress
has Increased the treasury's receipts to ttie
amount estimated by Its authorities, tho
finances of the government hare been suc
cessfully administrated and Its credit advanced
to the first rank, while Its currency has boon
maintained at the world's highest standard.
Military so trios undor a common Dug and lor a
righteous cause has strengthened the national
spirit and served to cement mors closely than
ever the fraternal bonds between every section
of the country.
The president here takes np the his
tory of the Cuban insurrection, the
failure of Spain to successfully cope
with affairs in the island and tho un
successful efforts of this country for a
peaceful solution of the matter. He
refers to the destruction of the battle
ship Maine, "a catastrophe the sus
picious nature and horror of which
stirred this nation's heart profoundly."
The initiatory steps lending up to the
war are recounted, the unanimity of
congress in passing needed legislation
to strengthen the executive is prnlsed
and the facts regarding the declara
tion of war are told anew. The presi
dent then recites the salient features
of the war, paying a glowing tribute
to America s heroes on land and sea:
refers to Dewey's remarkable victory
at Manila, to the military movements
In Cuba and finally to the destrnction
of Cerrera's fleet and the capitulation
of bsntiaga. Continuing, he says:
Mnanlari Overtore far I'fsn.
The annihilation of Admiral Cervora's fleet.
followed by the capitulation of Santiago. bav
log brought to the Spanish government a real'
lilna sense of tho hopelessness ot continuing a
struggle now becoming wholly unequal. It
made overtures of peacj through tho French
ambassador. Accordingly, on tho afternoon of
August li, M. Ciimbon, as the plenipotentiary
of Spain, and the secretary ot stutc, as the
plenipotentiary of the United States, signed a
protocol.
Immediately upon the conclusion of the pro
tocol, I Issued a proclamation of August li,
suspending hostilities on the part of the Called
8 talcs The necessary orders to that end were
at once given by telegraph, The blockade of
the ports of Cuba and Snn Juan do Porto Itico
was la like manner ruined. On August 18 the
muster out of Hxi.kw volunteers, or as near that
number as was found to bo practicable, was
ordered, Tho military committees to Mipcrln
tend the evacuation of Cuba, Porto Rico and
the adjacent islands were forthwith appointed.
The ran lomniisslun.
Pursuant to the fifth article of the protocol.
I appointed William It. Day, lately secretary
of state: Cushman K. Davis, William P. Frye
andOeorireOrar. senator ot tho United States,
mod Wnttclaw Held, to be the pence commis
sioners on the part of tho United States, Pro
Deeding In du season to Paris they there
met on the 1st of October five commissioners
similarly appointed on the part ot Spain. The
negotiations have made hopeful progress, so
that I trust soon to be able to lay a definite
treaty ot peace before the senate, with a ro
view at tho steps leading to Its signature.
Mllttarv Uuvernwsnee fur Time.
I do not discuss at this time the government
or the future of the new possessions which will
some to us the result of war with Spain. Such
a discussion will be appropriate after the
treaty of peace shall be ratified, in the mean'
tune and until congress has legislated other
wise. It will be my duty to continue the mill'
tary governments which have existed since our
occupation and give Its people security In life
and property and enoouragoment undor a Just
and beneficent rule.
The Nicaragua Canal Commission.
The Nicaragua canal commission, under the
championship of Rear Admiral John O. Walker,
appointed July li 187, act of June of that
year, has nearly completed Its labors, and the
results of lis exhaustive Inquiry Into the
proper route, the feasibility, and the cost of
construction of sn loter-occanis canal by
Nloaraguan route will bo laid before you In
the performance of Its task the commission re
calved all possible courtesy and assistance from
the governments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica,
which thus testified their appreciation of the
Importance of giving a speedy and practical
outcome to the great project that has for so
many yean engrossed the attention ot Uie re-
apeotlre countries.
Ths Parts Exposition.
There Is bow every prosptct that the partici
pation of the United States In the universal ex'
position to be held ia Pari la 1KB will be on a
acale commensurate with the advanced post
lion held by our products and Industries In the
world's chief marts. By a provision In the
sundry elvll appropriation act of July I, IWi. a

to our request, the protection of Americans
Bad their Interests In Spanish Jurisdiction was
assumed by the diplomatic and consular repr

delicate and arduous trust with tact and seal,
allotting high commendation.
It will give me special satisfaction If I shall
be authorised to communicate to yon a favor

Ike AaarzaMas of tae llawalun Island
Fending the consideration by the senate ot
the treaty signed June It, 1897, by tbe pleni
potentiaries ot the United S ts lea and ths ro
public of Hawaii providing for the annexation
of tbe islands, a Joint resolution to accomplish
the same purpose by aoceptlng ths off 'red eee

The provisions for strengthening the re
sources of tho treasury In connection with the
war has glvcu Increased confidence In the pur
pose and power of the government to maintain
the present standard, and has established more
firmly than ever the national credit st home
end abroad.
I renew so much of my recommendation of
December. 1897, as follows: , 'That when sny
of the United States notes are presented for
redemption In gold such notes shall bs kept
nnd set apart and only paid out in exchange for
gold. This Is nn obvious duty. If tbo holder
of the United States nolo prcfors the gold and
get It from tho government, he should not
rccelvo back from the government a unitua
State note without paying gold in exchange for
it The renou for this is made all mo more
apparent when the irovcrnment Issuosnn issue
bearing debt to provide gold for the redemp
tion of United States notes a non-Interest-
bcnrlntr dolA Surely it should not pay them
out again except on demand nnd for gold. If
they are put out In any other way they may re
turn again, to be followed by another bond Is
sue to redeem them, another interesting-bearing
debt to redeem n non-Interest bearing debt
This recommendation was made In the belief
that such provisions of law would Insure to a
greater degree the safety of the present stand
ard and belter protect our currency from tbe
danger to which it is subjected from a dis
turbance In the general business conditions of
the country.
In my Judgment the present condition of tho
treasury auply Justifies tho Immediate enact
ment of the legislation recommen led one year
ago, under which a portion of tbe gold hold
ings should bo placed In a trust fund from
which greenbacks should bo redeemed upon
presentation, but when ones rejourned should
not thereafter be paid out except for gold.
It 1 not to be inferred thut other legislation
relating to our currency Is not required. On
tho contrary, there Is an obvious demand for
It. The Importance of adequate provision
which will Insure to our future s money stand
ard related as our money standard now and to
that of our commercial rivals Is generally
recognised.
The companion proposition that our domes
tic paper currency shall be kept safe snd yet
be so related to the needs ot our Industries snd
internal commerce at to be adequate snd re
sponsive to such needs is s proposition scarce
ly less Important. The subject, in all Its parts.
Is commuuded to the wise consideration of tbe
congress.
Invfsitlgatlon nf Yellow Fever.
In mv last annual messaga I recommended
that conirrcsi authorize tho appointment of a
commission for the purpose of making syste
matic Investigations with reference to the
cause and provocation of yellow fever. This
matter has acquired an Increased importance
as a result of the military occupation ot the
Mnnd cf Cuba snd tho commercial Intercourse
between this island and the United States
which we have every reason to expect The
sanitary problems conneoted with our new re
lation! with th ) island of Cubs snd tbe acquisi
tion ot Porto Rico are no less Important than
those relating to finance, commerce and
administration.
Increase of the Army.
Under the act of congress approved April 14,
18W, authorizing the president In his discretion.
upon s declaration of war by oongress, or a
declaration by congress that war exists, I di
rected the Increase of the regular army to the
maximum of BiOou, authorised In said aot
There are now In the regular army 17,801 offl
eers and men. In said set It wsa provided 'that
at the end of any war la which the United
States may become involved the army shall be
reduced to s peace basis by tbe transfer in the
samt urm ot the scrvlo i or absorption by promo
tion or honorable discharge under auch regula
tions as tho secretary of war may establish of su
pernumerary commissioned officers snd tbe hon
orable discharge or transfer of supernumerary
enlisted men, and nothing contained in this sot
shall be construed ss suthorlzlng the perma
nent increase of the command or enlisted force
of the regular army bovond that now provided
by the law In force prior to tbe passage of this
act except as to the increase of si mujars pro
vided for In section I hereof."
The Importance of legislation for the per
manent Increase of the armv Is therefore manl
iest, and the reonmmendalion of the secretary
of war for that purpose has my nnquallUed ap
proval There can be no question that at this
time and probably for some tlmo In the future,
Iuo.ijO) men will be none too many to -meet the
necessities ot the situation. At all events.
whether that number shall b required per-
nmuently or not, the power should be given to
tbe president to enlist that force It, In bis dis
cretion It should b) neoes sry: and tbe further
discretion should be glvrn him to recruit with
in the above limit from the Inhabitants of the
Islands with tbo government of which we are
charged .
It is my purpose to muster out the entire vol
unteer army as soon a the congress shall pro
vide for the increase of the regular establish
ment This will be only sn act ot Justice and
will be much appreciated by the brave mea who
left their homes and employments to help tbe
country In Its emergency.

In my last annual message I stated: The
Union Pacific railway, main line, was sold
under the decree of the United States court for

Washington, Dee. 7. The report of
the secretary of the treasury to the
speaker of the house of representatives
waa made publlo yesterday. In the
report Secretary Gaffe aays: The rev
enues of the government from all
sources for the fiscal year ended Jane
80, 1898, were $404,838,953.75. The ex
pendltures for the same period were
CSS, 881,201.8.
In discussing; the question ot In'
creaainir the American merchant ma
rine tbe secretary says:
Wsr with Spain snd the annexation of the
Hawaiian archipelago, which have changed
the political and commercial relations of the
United States not only with Cubs, Porto Rico,
Hawaii and tbe Philippines, but slso with tbe
continents between which snd North America
those Islands are stepping atones, require the
prompt adoption of no affirmative maritime
policy by the united states. .
Tbe subject of money in Porto Rico
is discussed at length. Tbe secretary
says:
The existing currency of thst Island consists
of sliver coins known ss pesos snd cantavos.
The coin boar no fixed relation to gold, not
being nny where rideemuble In the yellow coin.
It Is unnecessary here to point out at any
length tho general evil results upon Industry
snd commerce of s currency medium so out of
harmony with the world's money ss to Induce
s widely-fluctuating rata of exchange It It
highly important that Amorloin capital should
find no obstacles In Its transfer lo and from
Porto Itica
It is, therefore, suggested that, at tbe proper
time, action be taken by congress to assimilate
the currency of Porto Klco to that of the
United Slates, so fur snd so rnpldly as this can
be dono without unduly disturbing existing
condition snd contract relations In Porto
Rica This. It Is bellevd. can be accomplished
by muklng custom dues in the Island payable
In American money, yet receiving the silver
pesos snd ccntavos at a fixed relation to our
dollar.
The subject of currency and bank'
injr is treated at length. The secretary
savs:
In submitting my report I feel It my duty to
Impress upon congress ss best I may. the Im
portant subject of currency snd banking re
form. With n financial system condemned by
the Judgment of tbe most experienced and wise,
both at home and abroad. Its evils Illustrated
In dully business nnd emphasized In recurring
panics, we full, with sn obtuse timidity, to face
tbe questions which must be met and rightly
solved before Industry and commerce can be
established upon enduring conditions of secu
rity. Tbe arguments strains! government Issues of
paper money ns a medium for commercial ex
changes have been fully made and need not be
repeated in detail. Its rigidity. Its falluro to
meet demands where demand Is most urgent,
the dependency of the whole industrial struc
ture upon the state of the revenue nnd publlo
expenditure these are important links In that
chain of argument The mennce to our domes
tic affairs, several times recurring from a
threatened change In the standurd under which
they nre carried on. and our foreign trade set
tled, ha been s companion evil perhaps ths
greater of the two.
The proposal to substitute bank Issue for
; government notes 1 opposed with many honest
prejudice and assailed by outer denunciation.
The first arise from a luiiure to comprcnena
ths true philosophy of a paper currency and
must be patiently considered Tbe latter ob
scure the question by reckless statements,
charging that all propositions for currency re
form sre bunk conspiracies to exploit tbe peo
ple. I shall not be outside ot my duty If I venture
to point out in at least one importnnt respect,
the advantages to the poorer districts of the
country of a properly constituted bank curren
cy. It mnv be done by falrlr describing the
course of the financial movement ss It now
goes on. nnd by presenting In contrast tbe
movement ss it would go on under the condi
tions advocated. It Is a familiar fact that.
In the period of harvesting and crop moving.
the currency Is strongly drawn from the
centers to tbe country dlatrlota When this
movement Is over, the currency again tends to
ward tbe centers The currency Bows to the
center to pay loans occasioned by Its use snd
other general Indebtedness, and also to secure
the benefit of the country banker tor s portion
of his funds whloh in s dull period would other
wise lie unemployed la his bands At present,
tbe currency so sent consist almost entirely
of legal-tender notes and treasury notes that
I to say. In tbe money which the law recog
nizes as lawful reserve. Ttus received by the
baukers In the money centers, It becomes a
reservo for deposit In the relation ot
one to four Now, deposl's msy
be Increased by loans s well as by the deposit
ot cash. A loan for IIO.OUO or tiO.OW goes to
tbe borrower's credit upon the bsnk's books
snd swells the deposit account by so much.
True, tbe borrower may check sgslnst this
fund, but his check may slso be deposited la
the same bank. In which case It U a mere trans
fer to another account: or. If It be deposited In
another bunk and paid In money by tbe lending
bank, it Is still a transfer. The total deposits
of all tho banks are swelled by this original
loan.
In confirmation that this expansive move
ment 1 fairly described I quote from the New
Vork Herald of November II ss follow: "Com
paring yesterday' (clearing houae) ststement

Whoever has followed this delineation of our
flntnclsl movement, and those whoare famll.ar
with ths facia which sre thus portrayed, ought
aot to have trouble la perceiving thai ths bot
tom cause of tbe Irregulsr snd deranging ef
fects described Is to be found In a fixed
volume of paper money clothed with
full powers of a legal tender. Upoa
this money Itself a credit obligation
other credit obligations, la the form of
bank deposits through bank loans, may be
built up In tbe proportion ot four lo one. With
tbe volume of paper monoy thus fixed with no
Batumi movement toward Its retirement when
aot needed la legitimate trade the tendency to
build the four-story structure upoa It at a per
manent base Is Irresistible. The withdraws!
of ths baas by those who reslly own It esuses
the structure to vibrate snd ihrestens it with a
fall.
Consider now, a briefly ss may be. the prac
tical working of a bank note currency non
legal tender If substituted for the paper money
Issued by the government Verification may
be found by those who will look for It In sys
tems bow current In France, Oermany. Scot
land and Canada; or. If our own records be pre
ferred, the New England system of 41 years
ago, or those then In vogue In Indiana, Iowa
and Louisiana, will be equally good examples,
When, with the recurring need of the In
terior to handle Its products of the furm. the
factory, and the mine, tbe power to Issue cir
culating notos msy be summoned Into use,
then the neeJs of Industry will coincide with
lhe profit-moving motives of tbe bsnker, and
the full value of this latent powjr will be ex
perienced, nol In tbe centers, where bank
notes are not needed and will not circulate, but
In tbe Interior, where raw product are raised,
and where the busy wheel of chop and factory
certify that labor wages are to be paid.
Tbe power of the bank note, so temporarily
suspended, will si ways be restored in full upon
the call of Industry. The power of our present
eurrrnoy, on the contrary. Is not suspended It
Is. ss pointed out. Inevitably misdirected. It
artificially stimulates speculative activity In
securities st the centers It practically ab
sorbs tbe credit powers st times when they
should be made serviceable to tbe .whole ooua
try. It ministers to tbe speculator. It preju
dices the producer, the merchant and tbe man
ufacturer, though, at last, all suffer from
it deranging Influences These are the rea
sons, the more Important reasons, why our
banking system should be reformed snd made
effective to commercial and Industrial needs:
and thee same reasons with others not here
set forth, call for the elimination. In s safe and
proper way, of the Injurious Interference In our
currenoy system by tbe legal tender paper
money of the government
If It be conceded tbat tbe legal tender money
Issued by tho government does not possess the
qualifications to make It a proper factor lo tbe
country's exchanges of products nnd manufac
tures; If the fact also be admitted tbat It I a
deranging and disturbing fnctor In Its relation
to Industry and commerce, then the time ha
come to substitute for It a currency which will
adequately, economically and safely meet the
ever growing needs of the country, rapidly de
veloping, as it Is, In the power of production.
In the number of it people nnd the importance
of Its domestic snd foreign trade
In the nature of things the banker Is the
proper agency for operating this Important
function, lie must have motlvo for bis action

he will, like the laborer, tbe merchant or the
professional man. be diligent In the employ'
