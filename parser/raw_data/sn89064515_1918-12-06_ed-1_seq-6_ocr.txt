Washington, Dec. 3.—Following to
itlio full text of President Wilson's
message, delivered by him before both
houses of congress:
Text of the Message.
(Gentlemen of the -Congress:
The year that has elapsed since I
llaat stood before you to fulfill my con
stitutional duty to give the congress,
jjrom time to time, information on the
latate of the Union has been so crowd
led with great events, great processes
fand great results that I cannot hope
Ito give you an adequate picture of its
[transactions or of the far-reaching
•ohanges which have been wrought in
tthe life of bur nation and of the world.
ITou have yourselves witnessed these
(things as I have. It is too soon to as
sess them, and we who stand in the
midst of them and are part of them
«re less qualified than' men of another
generation will be to say what they
mean, or even what they have been.
But some great outstanding facts are
unmistakable and constitute in a sense
part of the public business with which
It Is our duty to deal. To state them
Is to set the stage for the legislative
and exeoutive action which must grow
out of them and which we have yet to
shape and determine.
A year ago we had sent 145,918 men
overseas. Since then we have sent
1,950,513, an average of 162,542 each
month, the number Jn fact rising in
May last to 245,951, in June to 278,760,
in July to 307,182 and continuing to
reach similar figures in August and
September—in August 289,570 and in
September 257,438.
Movement le Unique.
No such movement of troops ever
took place before, across 3,000 miles
of sea, followed by adequate equip
ment and supplies and carried safely
through extraordinary dangers of ati
tack dangers which were alike
strange and infinitely difficult to guard
•gainst. In all this movement only
758 men were lost by enemy attacks—
30 of whom were upon a single Eng
lish transport, which was sunk near
the Orkney islands.
Fighters Are Praissd.
But it is not the physical scale and
executive efficiency of preparation,
supply, equipment and dispatch that I
would dwell upon, but the mettle and
quality of the officers and men we sent
over and of the sailors who kept the
seas, and the spirit of the nation that
stood behind them. No soldiers or
sailors ever proved themselves more
quickly ready for the test of battle
or acquitted themselves with more
splendid courage and achievement
when put to the test. Those of us who
played some part In directing the
great processes by which the war was
poshed irresistibly forward to the
jbaal triumph may now forget all that
and delight our thoughts with the
story of what our men did.
I need not tell you what lay back of
«m« great movement of men and map
terlal. it to not Invidious to say that
back of it lay a supporting organisa
tion of the Industries of the country
and all its productive activities more
complete, more thorough in method
and effective in results, more spirited
mad unanimous in purpose and' effort
than any other great belligerent had
ever been able to effect. We profited
greatly by the experience of the na
tions which had already been en
gaged for nearly three years in the
exigent and exacting business, their
every resource and every executive
proficiency taxed to the utmost. We
#ere the pupils, but we learned quick
ly and acted with a promptness and a
readiness of co-operation that Justify
eur great pride that we were able to
serve the world with unparalleled
energy
and quick accomplishment.
Their officers understood the grim
and exacting task they had undertaken
and performed with audacity, effi
ciency and unhesitating courage that
touch the story of convoy and battle
with imperishable distinction at every
tarn, whether the enterprise were
great or small from their chiefs,
Pershing and Sims, down to thi young
est lieutenant, and their men worthy
of them—such men as hardly need to
he commanded, and go to their ter
l&hle adventure blithely and with the
Mick intelligence of those who know
flat what it to they would accomplish.
I am proud to be the fellow country*
Ijfcan of men of such stuff and valor.
Those of us who stayed at home did
i«iiir duty—the war could not have been
tjjjipn or the gallant m« who fought It
given their opportunity to win 1C other,
i^lse bnt for many a long day we
shell think ourselves "accursed we
v^ere not there and hold our manhood
cheap while any speaks that fought"
wfy& these at St. Mlhlel or Thierry.
The memory of those days of triumph
ant battle will go with these fortu
nate men to their graves, and each will
have his favorite memory. "Old men
forget, yet all shall be forgot, but hell
remember with advantages what feats
ha did that day."
URGED BY WILSON
__
PreeWent Wilson's readjustment
program Ineludea:
Passage of woman suffrage.
Uee of existing government
agenelee to effect reconstruction.
Immetfiete raevmptlen of devil*
epment of public works to provide
employment for returning eoldlera.
Ratification of the Columbian
treaty to Improve Pan-American
relatione.
Immediate determination of

unmodified.
Urges railroad control question
he studied by Congreee immedl
atoly to quickly remove doubt of
their future.
Reclamation of arid, swamp and
eutover land.
Germans Beaten Back.
What we all thank God for with
deepest gratitude is that our men went
in force into the line of battle just at
the critical moment when the whole
fate of the world seemed to hang in
the balance, and threw their fresh
strength into the ranks of freedom In
time to turn the whole tide and sweep
of the fateful struggle—turn it once
for all, so that henceforth it was back,
back, back for their enemies, always
back, never again forward. After that'
it was only- a scant four months before
the commanders of the Central Em
pires knew themselves beaten and
now their very empires are in liquida
tion.
And through it all how fine the
spirit of the'nation was. What unity
of purpose, what untiring zeal what
elevation of purpose ran through all
its splendid display of strength, its un
tiring accomplishment. I have said
that those of us who stayed at home to
do the work of organisation and sup
ply will always wish that we had been
with the men whom we sustiained by
our labor but we can never be
ashamed.
Must Steady Bueineee.
For the steadying and facilitation of
our own domestic business readjust
ment nothing is more Important than
the immediate determination of the
taxes that are to be levied for 1918,
1919 and 1920. As much of the burden
of taxation must be lifted from bust
ness as sound methods of financing the
government will permit, and those who
conduct the great essential industries
of the country must be told as exactly
as possible what obligations to the
government they will be expected to
meet in the years Immediately ahead
of them. It will be of serious conse
quence to the country to delay all un
certainties In this matter a single day
longer than the right processes of de
bate Justify. It is idle to talk of suc
cessful and confident business recon
struction before those uncertainties
are resolved.
If the war had continued it would
have been necessary to raise at least
$8,000,000,000 by taxation payable in
the year 1919 but the war has ended
and I agree with the secretary of the
treasury that it, will be safe to reduce
the amount to $6,000,000,000. An im
mediate rapid decline in the expenses
of the government is not to be looked
for. Contracts made for war supplies
will, indeed, be rapidly canceled and
liquidated, but their immediate liqui
dation will make heavy drains" on the
treaeury for the months Just ahead of
VI.
Expeneee Still High.
The maintenance of our forces on
the other side of the sea is still neces
sary. A considerable proportion of
those forces must remain in Europe
during the period of occupation, and
those which are brought home will be
transported and demobilised at heavy
expense for months to come. The in*
terest on our war debt must of course
bes paid and provision made for the
retirement of the obligations of the
government which represents-it. But
these demands will of course fall much
vbelow what a continuation of military
operations would have entailed and
$6,000,000,000 should suffice to supply a
sound foundation for the financial
operations of the year.
I entirely concur with the secretary
of the treasury in recommending that
the $2,000,000,000 needed in addition
to the $4,000,000,000 provided by ex
isting law be obtained from the profits
which have accrued and shall accrue
from war contracts and distinctively
war business, but that these taxes be
confined to the war profits accruing
In 1918 or in 1919 from business orig
inating In war contracts. I urge your
acceptance of his recommendation
that provision be made now, not sub
sequently, that the taxes to be paid |n
1920 should be reduced from six to
tour billions. Any arrangement lees
definite than these would add elements
of doubt and confusion to the critical
period of industrial readjustment
through which the country must now
immediately pass, and which no true
Mend of the nation's essential busi
ness interests can afford to be respon
sible for creating or prolonging. Clear
ly determined conditions, clearly and
aimply charted, are indispensable to
the economic revival and rapid indus
trial development which may confi
dently be expected tt we act now and
sweep all interrogation points away.
Pleade for Navy Program.
I take it tor, granted that the «oa

IJTTLB FALLS HERALD, PBQEMSBBR g, 19M
.cakOn^Mfire we
entered the war. The secretary of the
iivy has eihaaitted to your committee
tor authorisation that part of the pro
gram which covers the building plana
pC the next three years. Tluie plana
fevobeen prepared along the Mhes
mi In accordance with the policy
whteh the oongress established, not
inkier the exceptional conditions of
the war, but with the Intention of ad*
hering to a definite method of develop*
mtat tor the Navy. I earnestly rec
ommend the uninterrupted pursuit of
that policy. It would clearly be un
wlie for us to attempt to adjust our
programs to a future world policy as
yet undetermined.
The question which causep the great
est concern to the question of the pol
icy to be adopted toward the railroads.
I frankly turn to you for counsel upon
it. I have no confident judgment of my
own. I do not see how any thoughtful
man can have who knows anything of
the complexity of the problem. It to
a problem which must be studied,
studied immediately and studied with
out bias or prejudice. Nothing can be
gained by becoming partisan of any
particular plan of settlement.
Railroade Up to Congress.
It was necessary that the adminis
tration of the railways should be taken
over by the government so long as the
war lasted. It would have been impos
sible otherwise to establish and carry
through under a single direction the
necessary priorities of shipments. It
would have been impossible otherwise
to combine maximum production at the
factories and mines and farms with
the maximum possible car supply to
take the products to the ports and
markets impossible to route troops,
shipments and freight shipments with
out regard to the advantage or disad
vantage of the roads employed im
possible to subordinate, when neces
sary, all questions of convenience to
the public necessity impossible to
give the necessary financial support to
the roads from the public treasury.
But all these necessities have now
been served, and the, question to, what
'e best for the railroads and for the
tblic In the future?
