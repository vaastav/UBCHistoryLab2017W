YOLITaIE 96.-NO. 108.
HOW HAWAII IS
TO BE GOVERNED.
President McKinley Yesterday
Transmitted to Congress
The Report and Full Text of Three Bills
Drawn Up by the Commission.
A General Plan of Government of
the Islands as a Territory of the
United States Outlined, Giving
Them Executive, Legislative and
Judicial Officers, and a Delegate
to Congress.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—The Presi
dent to-day transmitted to Congress
the report of the Hawaiian Commis
sion, consisting of Senators Cullom and
Morgan, Representative Hitt, Presi
dent Dole and Judge Frear of Hawaii,
together with the full text of the bills
drawn by the commission for the gov
ernment of the islands as a portion of
the United States. The preliminary
portion of the report is mainly de
scriptive of the Hawaiian Islands, the
inhabitants, the existing institutions,
the public domain, production, climate,
harbors and shipping facilities, and
various conditions of general interest.
The remaining portion is mainly de
voted to the discussion of the legisla
tion proposed by the commission, giv
ing in the appendix the various reports
of sub-committees and copies of the
bills suggested.
Three bills are formulated for the
consideration of Congress. The first
and principal one outlines a general
plan of government, and the other two
deal with subordinate questions. Of the
main bill the Commissioners express
the opinion that it will prove to be
"such a measure for the government
of the Hawaiian Islands as will best
promote the interests of their people
at the same time that it promotes the
interests and maintains the sovereignty
of the people of the United States."
It provides for the erection of the
islands into a territory of the United
States, to be styled the Territory of
Hawaii. The bill contains provisions
for the government of the Territory,
giving it executive, legislative and ju
dicial officers. A Governor, Secretary
of the Territory, a United States Dis
trict Judge, a United States District
Attorney and a United States Marshal
are to be appointed by the President,
and an internal revenue district and a
customs district are created. The of
fices of President, Minister of Foreign
Affairs, Finance, Public Instruction,
Auditor General, Deputy Auditor Gen
eral, Surveyor General and Marshal
are abolished.
The officers of the Territory under
the new regime are an Auditor Gen
eral, with similar powers and duties as
now possessed by the Attorney General
of the Republic of Hawaii, with a few
exceptions: a Treasurer, with similar
powers and duties to the present Min
ister of Finance, and such powers and
duties regarding licenses, corporations
and companies and partnerships and
registration of prints, labels and trade
marks as are now possessed by the
Minister of the Interior, except as
changed: also a Superintendent of
Public Works, a Superintendent of
Public Instruction, an Auditor and a
Deputy Auditor, a Surveyor, with
powers and duties of a Surveyor Gen
eral and a Chief Sheriff, to succeed to
the duties of Marshal of the Republic,
all to be appointed by the Governor.
Probably the most Important portion
of the bill is Section 4, defining citizen
ship, which provides that "all white
persons, including Portuguese and per
sons of African descent, and all per
sons descending from the Hawaiian
race on either the paternal or maternal
side, who were citizens of the Republic
of Hawaii, immediately prior to the
transfer of sovereignty thereof to the
United States, are hereby declared to
be citizens of the United States."
Provision is made for a Legislature,
to consist of two houses—a Senate, to
consist of fifteen members, as at pres
ent, and a House of Representatives,
consisting of thirty members, double
the membership 'of the House under the
Hawaiian Republic. The members are
to be elected at a general election, to
be held on the Tuesday after the first
Monday in November. 1899, and bi
ennially thereafter. The Supreme Court
is to be the sole judge of the legality
of election to a seat in either house
in case of contest. No member of the
Legislature is to be eligible for ap
pointment or election to any office of
the Territory, and no officer or em
ploye, Notary Public or agent of the
Territory is to be eligible to election as
a legislator. There is also a provision
that no person who. having been en
titled to qualify and vote prior to Oc
tober, 1897. and since July. 1894. failed
to register as such voter, shall have a
vote, unless he shall take an oath to
support the Constitution of the United
States. The sessions of the Legisla
ture are limited to sixty days in dura
tion, and each member is allowed $400
as salary and 10 cents a mile for trav
eling expenses.
A Senator is required to be a male
citizen of the United States, 30 years
of age, to have resided in the Territory
three years, be the owner in his own
right of $2,000 worth of property, or to
have during the preceding year re
ceived $1,000 income. Representatives
must be 25 years old, male citizens,
must have lived three years in Hawaii
and must own property or have an in
come of $250 a year.
Voters for Representatives are re
quired to be male citizens, 21 years of
age and of one year's residence in the
Territory, to have registered, to have
paid all taxes due the Government, and
to be able "understandingly to speak,
read and write the English or Hawaiian
language."
To be qualified to vote for Senators a
person must possess all the qualifica
tions and be subject to all the con
ditions required of voters for Repre
sentatives, and, in addition, own in his
own right real property worth $3,000.
upon which valuation legal taxes shajf
have been paid for the year preceding
that in which he offers to register, or
shall have actually received a money
THE RECORD-UNION.
income of not less than $000 during the
previous year.
Five registration districts are pro
vided and the Governor of the Terri
tory is authorized to appoint registra
tion boards, with the advice of the Sen
ate.
The bill also provides for the election
of a delegate to the House of Repre
sentatives in Congress by the voters
qualified to vote for representatives in
the Legislature, this delegate to possess
the same powers and privileges now ac
corded to other delegates in Congress.
The Governor is to appoint a Chief
Justice and two Associate Justices of
the Supreme Court, the Judges of the
Circuit Court, the members of the
Board of Health, Commissioners of
Public Instruction, Prison Inspectors,
Boards of Registration, Inspectors of
Election and other public boards that
may be created by law and all officers
whose salaries exceed $2,000 per an
num.
Other provisions of the bill are as
follows:
The Governor is to possess the veto
power, but his veto may be overridden
by a two-thirds vpte of both houses of
the Legislature.
The Legislature is authorized to cre
ate town, city or county municipalities.
Foreign goods and articles imported
into the islands after July 7, 1898, are,
if afterward brought into the United
States, to pay the same duties charged
upon like articles when imported from
any foreign country. The existing laws
of Hawaii not inconsistent with the
Constitution and the laws of the United
States or this Act continue in force,
subject to repeal or amendment by
the Legislature of Hawaii or by Con
gress.
The laws of Hawaii relating to pub
lic lands continue in force until chang
ed by Congress, but no leases or agri
cultural lands are to be granted, sold
or renewed for a longer term than five
years unless Congress shall direct.
The laws of Hawaii relating to agri
culture and forestry are continued in
force, except as they may be modified
by Congress or the Legislature, and
the Secretary of Agriculture is charged
with the duties of examining the laws
of Hawaii relating to agriculture, for
estry, public lands and public roads,
and report thereon to the President.
The bill also provides that the Con
stitution and laws of the United States
locally applicable shall have the same
force and effect in the Territory of Ha
waii as elsewhere in the United States.
This is the usual provision found in
the Acts of Congress providing for the
establishment of Territorial govern
ments in the United States, but 1
Commissioners regard the provision
exceptionally important in this bill for
many reasons, among which they men
tion the continued importation of
Chinese labor into Hawaii. Remarking
on this point, they say:
"It has been the policy of the Gov
ernment of Hawaii, before and since
the establishment of the republic, to
import men under labor contracts for
a term of years, at the expiration of
which they are to return to the coun
tries from which they came. Those
brought in are mainly from China and
Japan. Since the Act of Congress an
nexing Hawaii was passed prohibiting
Chinese immigration, Hawaiin sugar
planters have seemed to be making an
unusual effort in securing the importa
tion 'of Japanese laborers, fearing
trouble and embarrassment on account
of the insufficient labor for the care
and carrying on of their sugar planta
tions. Of course, it becomes necessary
to extend our labor laws over the isl
ands, so as to prohibit all kinds of
foreign contract labor from coming to
the Territory, first, because it is the
policy of this country to keep out all
kinds of cheap foreign labor, including
coolie labor, and thereby prevent such
labor from interfering with the wages
of American labor: and, secondly, to
protect our manufactured products
from competition with manufactured
goods produced by cheap alien labor.
The general laws of the United States
will place the people of the Territory
on the same footing as the people of
the States and other Territories of the
United States in regard to the foreign
labor. The question whether white la
bor can be profitably used in the sugar
plantations is yet a problem, but- the
planters are preparing to give such la
bor a trial, and some of them believe
it will prove superior to the labor of
either Chinese or Japanese."
The Commissioners take pains to ex
press their united opinion that the plan
outlined for the government of Hawaii
cannot be regarded as a precedent for
Porto Rico and the Philippines, say
ing on this point:
"Much has been said to the effect
that the policy of the scheme of gov
ernment for the Hawaiian Islands will
be taken and accepted as an index or
precedent to be followed in the plan
of government of Porto Rico and the
Philippines. In view of this apparent
expectation or belief on tire part of
many good people in the United States,
the commission deems it proper to
state that the people of Hawaii are
capable of self-government, and have
proven this by the establishment of the
republic of Hawaii, and the adoption
of a Constitution and code of laws
which would compare favorably with
those of any other government, and un
der such Constitution and laws have
maintained a stable government for
several years worthy of a free people.
The people of those islands are more
or less familiar with the institutions
and laws of the United States, /s the
laws of the little republic are largely
taken from the laws of this country.
"It cannot be said that either the
Porto Ricans or the Philippines are at
all familiar with our system of gov
ernment, or with any other T>ased on
the principles of liberty. The under
lying theory of our Government is the
right of self-government, and a people
must be fitted for self-government be
fore they can be trusted with responsi
bilities and duties attaching to free
government.
"These remarks are made .to negative
the idea that because the people of the
Hawaiian Islands can, in the judgment
of the commission, be consistently
given self-government to an extent al
most equal to that given the people
of the States, it can be safety inferred
that other insular possessions which
the United States have or may acquire
by treaty with Spain can be granted
equal freedom of government."
The report is unanimous except on
one point, on Which President Dole
makes a minority recommehdation.
This recommendation is for a Board of
Advisers to the Governor of the Ter
ritory, and he recommends that the
Treasurer. Attorney General, Superin
tendent of Public Works and Commis
sioner of Public Lands shall be con
stituted special counsellors of the Gov
ernor, to be consulted by him concern
ing all matters of public policy.

REMODELING OF
REGULAR ARMY.
Seneral Miles Has Submitted to
Secretary of War Alger
The Measure Which is to Serve as a Basis

Restores the Rank of General and
Lieutenant General of the
Army, Providing for One of the
Former and Two of the Latter,

WASHINGTON, Dec. G.—The meas
ure which will serve as the basis for
the action of Congress at this session,
looking to the increase and remodeling
of the regular United States army, has
been completed by the commanding
General of the army, and to-day was
handed by him to Secretary Alger, who
will transmit it to Congress, probably
through the Chairman of the House
Committee on Military Affairs, Repre
sentative Hull, after he has had an
opportunity to make any changes that
he may deem desirable.
The bill contains the following pro
visions:
"Be it enacted, etc., that the military
establishment of the United States shall
hereafter consist of fifteen regiments
of cavalry, fourteen regiments of sea
coast artillery, two regiments of field
artillery, two regiments of engineers,
fifty regiments of infantry, the profes

"Section 2—That the regiments of
cavalry shall be organized as now pro
vided by law, each to consist of three
squadrons of four troops, each troop
to be organized as shall be provided
in this Act; provided, that each regi

shall be as provided in this Act; pro
vided, that each regiment of sea coast
artillery shall consist of 1,200 enlisted
men, and each regiment of field artil
lery of 1,032 enlisted men, with the
necessary complement of officers; pro
vided, further, that the President may,
in his discretion, convert such field bat
teries as may seem to him to be neces
sary from time to time, in seige bat
teries, horse artillery batteries or
mounted batteries.
"Section 4—That the infantry arm of
the service shall consist of fifty regi
ments of three battalions of four com
panies each, each company to be or
ganized as shall be provided in this
Act; provided, that the regiment of in
fantry shall consist of 1,200 • enlisted
men; and, provided further, that the in
fantry arm of the service be organized
on the basis of two army corps of three
divisions of three brigades of three
regiments each."
The bill then specifies the officers and
men for each regiment of cavalry, in
fantry and artillery. In each case there
are to be one Colonel, one Lieutenant
Colonel, three Majors, twelve Captains,
fourteen First Lieutenants (one First
Lieutenant to be appointed Adjutant
and one First Lieutenant to be appoint
ed Quartermaster), twelve second Lieu
tenants, besides minor officers peculiar
to each branch of service. Captains are
to be appointed for colored regiments.

jutant Generals with the rank of Colo
nel, six Assistant Adjutant Generals
with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel;
twelve Assistant Adjutant Generals
with the rank of Major and twenty-six
Assistant Adjutant Generals with the
rank of Captain mounted,"
Several provisos follow regarding the
appointment of special details and pro
motions of officers. The bill then con
tinues:
"Section 10—That there shall be one
Inspector General of the army with
the rank of Major General, one Assist
ant Inspector General with the rank of

EMBASSADOR CLAYTON.
i President M'Kinley Sends the Nom
ination to the Senate.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—The Presi
dent to-day sent to Congress the nomi
nation of Powell Clayton of Arkansas to
be an Embassador to Mexico. Senor
Romero, the former Mexican Minister,
having been raised to the rank of an
Embassador, Mr. Clayton's promotion
followed under an Act of Congress.
The President also sent to the Sen
ate a number of appointments made
during the recess. They include those
of Secretary Hay, Assistant Secretary
of State Hill, the Hawaiian Commis
sion, the Paris Commission and a num
ber of Consuls.
The Puehla Arrives at Manila.
WASHINGTON, Dec. G. —A cable
gram received by the War Department
to-day from General Otis announces
the arrival at Manila of the transport
Puebla. There was little sickness and
no deaths. The troops on the Puebla
were five companies of the First Ten
nessee, a troop of Nevada Volunteer
Cavalry, a detachment of the Twenty
third Infantry, a detachment of the
First California Heavy Artillery, alto
gether twenty-five officers and 600 men,
commanded by Lieutenant Colonel
Childers.
THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURE.
SHORT SESSION IN EACH OF
THE HOUSES YESTERDAY.
The First Note of the Anti-Expan
sionist Sounded in the Senate
hy Vest of Missouri.
WASHINGTON, Dec. G. —The first I
note of the anti-expansionists was
sounded in the Senate to-day by Vest, of
Missouri who introduced the following j
joint resolution:
■ "That under the Constitution of the
United States no power is given to the j
Federal Government to acquire terri-j
tory to be held and governed perma- j
nently as colonies.
"The colonial system\ of European na
tions cannot be established under our
present Constitution, but' all territory
acquired by the Government, except
such small amount as may be necessary
for coaling stations, correction, of boun
daries and similar Governmental pur
poses, must be acquired and governed
with the purpose of ultimately organiz
ing such territory into States suitable
for admission into the Union."
A brief discussion of the navigation
laws was precipitated by the consider
ation of a bill amending those laws
by the addition of a provision that for
eign-built vessels wrecked in the Unit
ed States, purchased by citizens of this !
country and repaired to the extent of j
three-fourths of their value, shall be
subject to forfeiture if they engage sub
sequently in the coastwise trade of the
United States.
Vest, a member of the Committee on
Commerce, expressed his opposition to i
the bill, principally because it afford
ed protection to the coastwise trade,
which needed no protection. Under
the present system of navigation laws
this trade had decreased from l'y p?r
cent, to 11 per cent., and this country
is now paying $150,000,000 annually to
foreign ship owners for carrying trade
that ought to be carried in American
bottoms. This condition of affairs,"
Vest declared, "was a scandal and dis
grace."
He said he had been amused "at the
suggestion of the President, made :n
his message submitted yesterday, that j
our carrying trade be encouraged by ihe j
payment of subsidies. "In other words," j
said he, "it is proposed to substitute for
the vicious system of navigation laws !
a scheme of subsidies that is even more
vicious than is the evil it proposes to
remedy.
"Under the proposed policy! of the Ad
ministration," continued Vest, "we are
to build a great navy. We are to cease
to be a nation of traders, and, under
the impulse of the policy of expansion,
become a nation of warriors. It would
appear to me to be better first to build
up our carrying trade. I would also
let our people, through the beneflcient
effects of such trade, buy where they
can buy cheapest."
Caffery of Louisiana as a member of
the Committee on Commerce, opposed
the bill.
Finally it was made a special order
for next Monday.
At 1:30 p. m. the Senate adjourned.
IN THE HOUSE.
WASHINGTON, Dec. o.—The House
was in session less than half an hour
to-day, when the death of Representa
tives Northway (Ohio), and Love (Mis
sissippi) were announced, and an ad
journment was taken until to-morrow
out of respect to their memory.
The customary resolution for the dis
tribution of the President's message to
the several committees having jurisdic
tion was adopted, and the deficiency bill
carrying appropriations for the extra
ordinary expenses of the army and
navy from January Ist to July 1. 1899,
was reported, and will be taken up by
the House to-morrow.
The report on the Hawaiian Commis
sion transmitted to the President was
laid before the House and referred to
the Committee on Territories, together
with a bill offered by Hitt to carry out
the recommendations of the committee.
TREATY NEARING
COMPLETION.
Essentia! Features of the Conven
tion Disposed Of.
Only Eight Subjects of Secondary Import
ance Yet to Be Considered,
Will Be No Need of a Commission
Such as Arranged for Evacua
tion of West Indies to Perform
the Same Service in the Philip
pines,' So Completely Are the
Details Stipulated—Spain's Re
quest for Free Shipping in Cu
ban and Porto Rican Waters
■
Rejected.
PARIS, Dec. 6.—The peace treaty of
Paris is practically an accomplished
fact. To-day's session disposed of the
essential features of jthe treaty, which
will be embodied in the following eight
articles:
First —The customary preface of trea
ties, in the nature of an expression of
amity and of hope for perpetual peace.
Second—The relinquishment of Spain
of her sovereignty over Cuba.
Third—The withdrawal of the Spanish
troops.
Fourth—The relinquishment by Spain
of her sovereignty over Porto Rico.
Fifth—Spain's cession of the Philip
pines.
Sixth—The withdrawal of the Spanish
troops there.
Seventh—Payment by the United
States of $20,000,000 for the Philippines.
Eighth—The provision for the "open
door" commercial policy in the Phil
ippines. ,
The rough draft of the treaty, which
may be considerably changed, covers
the proposals. It makes a long docu
ment, which Senator Davis of the Unit
ed States Peace Commission says will
be found to be one of the most inter
esting papers in its character ever writ
ten. So completely are the details of
the evacuation of the Philippines stip
ulated that a commission such as ar
ranged for the Spanish withdrawal
from the West Indies will be unneces
sary.
Among the questions not yet settled,
however, are the coaling station and
religious freedom in the Carolines, the
Spanish Commission not having replied
to the American offer.
The Americans have agreed to trans
port the Spanish prisoners home, in
cluding the garrison and sailors at Ma
nila captured by Admiral Dewey and
General Merritt, as well as the soldiers
and civilians held by the Filipinos,
whose return theVAmericans have guar
anteed. As compensation, Spain prom
ises to liberate all Cuban, Porto Rican
and Philippine political prisoners. Span
ish soldiers electing to remain in the
colonies may do so, but it is more a
matter of economy for the Americans
to return the others, as they must be
fed as long as they are kept, and Spain
is s unable to bear the expense of the
repatriation.
Also the Americans have rejected
Spain's request for free shipping for
ten years in Cuban and Porto l-iican
waters, they having given the Spanish
Commissioners such poor consolation as
the latter may derive from the permis
sion to reapply Vhen the diplomatic
relations have been renewed for ship
ping concessions under the reciprocity
scheme of the Dingley law, for which
Senor Dupuy de Lome was negotiating
in Washington when the war broke out.
There are still under discussion eight
secondary subjects which the Spanish
Commissioners broached last week, in
cluding the status of patents and copy
rights. The American Commissioners
to-day handed to Senqr; Montero Rios a
written reply covering these questions.
There will probably be no joint session
to-morrow r , as the Spaniards desire time
to consider this document.
It has developed that yesterday's ses
sion w r as of far greater importance than
generally supposed. It resulted in the
Americans uncompromisingly rejecting
Spain's request that for a term of years
the ships of that country and its pro
ducts be admitted to Cuban and Porto
Rican ports under the same regulations
and customs tariff as American ships
and products.
Use Spanish Commission for some
days has been playing for time. The
Americans were anxious for a decision
on the question of a coaling station in
the Caroline Islands, religious tolerance
in the Carolines and the release"" of
political prisoners. The Spaniards were
unwilling to answer these points until
they heard what the Americans pro
psed to do for their industries w r hich
had been built up by the Cuban and
Porto Rican trade. This is why Spain
contended that the articles of the
treaty should be disposed of in their
order, while the Americans wanted first
to settle their pressing need.
The session of yesterday was practi
cally a fight on the order of procedure.
Finally the Americans yielded, and then
the Spaniards proposed their shipping
and commercial question, which the
Americans rejected in its entirety. The
session then adjourned, with neither
side in an especially amiable frame of
mind.
It is learned that there were differ
ences of opinion among the Americans
on the shipping question, and numerous
telegrams were exchanged with Wash
ington. Finally the American Commis
sion was instructed to refuse, the prin
cipal reason being that Porto Rico is
about to be declared within the coast
line of the United States, while as re
gards Cuba, the authorities at Wash
ington would make no promises, as the
American occupation is not fixed and
the future Cuban Government will
make its own treaties.
Exactly what Spain requested was
that her ships and products should be
accorded the same privileges in Cuba
and Porto Rico for a period' of ten years
as had been conceded to Spain in the
Philippines. This request was sup
ported by the precedents in the cases of
Louisiana and Florida, when the prod
ucts and shipments of France and
Spain were admitted to the ports of
New Orleans, Pensacola and St. Augus
tine for twelve years, the same as those
of the United States. In the ease of
the purchase of Louisiana, the same
privileges were extended to the pro
ducts and ships of Spain because she
had ceded Louisiana to France three
years previously.
When the Commissioners emerged
from the Foreign Office this evening
after their long joint session, Judge
Day announced that all requests had
been settled, and that the treaty would
be signed in three or four days. The
work remaining consists largely in
drafting into language the conclusions
reached.
MAY BE SIGNED WITHIN A DAT
OR TWO.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6—The advices
from Paris to the effect that it might
be reasonably presumed that the Peace
Commissioners will be ready to sign a
treaty of peace within a day or two is
fully confirmed. It is learned that the
President's instructions to Judge Day
were to hasten the conclusion, and to
that end the American Commissioners
have been authorized to limit the treaty
closely to protocol points, leaving other
matters, such as the acquisition of ca
ble stations and naval stations to be
dealt with hereafter.
As such separation of points is en
tirely in line with the expressed de
sire of the Spanish Commissioners,
there appears to be no reason, now that
an agreement has been reached as to
all of the protocol points, why those
should not be immediately reduced to
the form in which it is desired they
should appear in a treaty and be at
orce signed by the Commissioners. In
this case it is possible that the treaty
of peace may be submitted to Congress
even before the Christmas recess.
AN INSIGNIFICANT AFFAIR.
What President Stickney Says of
Boycotting the Great Western.
ST. PAUL, Dec. G. —President A. B.
Stickney of the Chicago Great, Western
has returned from the East, and has
this to say about the boycotting of
his road, which he pronounced "an in
significant affair/
' Out of the passenger business we
handled in connection with the Santa
Fe last year, the Chicago Great West
ern received only $5,000. The Santa
Fe received $19,000. If they want to
lose $19,000 to injure us to the slight
extent they can, they may do so. I
do not know just how much freight
we exchanged with them last year, but
the whole affair that the newspapers
are talking about amounts to little.
The Great Western has many connec

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 6. — The
steamship Australia, which arrived
from Honolulu to-day, brings the fol
lowing advices under date of Novem
ber 20th:
The steamer Mauna Loa has just ar-«
rived from the island of Hawaii with
the news that the ship W. H. Starbuck
burned to the water's edge on Novem
ber sth in latitude 13.70 north, longi
tude 131 degrees west. She was bound
from Port Blakely to South Africa,
with 1,000,000 cubic feet of lumber.
Captain McDonald's boat, with his
wife and first mate, nine of the crew
and three babies, landed at Hookena
on November 20th. Neither the Cap
tain nor any of the crew came to Hon
olulu, and it is impossible to get de
tails at this writing. " ' \
The vessel was out nineteen days
from Bort Blakely, when fire was dis
covered in the hold. The fire raged
fiercely, and in a few hours the Cap
tain and crew were forced to take to
the boats. All on board embarked in
three boats, and the ship was left to
her fate. The boats remained together
for four days, when the first mate's
boat capsized, the cook being lost. A
storm came up several days later, and
during the rough weather the second
mate's boat was lost sight of, and has
not been heard of since.

A poster all over the south side of tho
town has created consternation in the
Chinese colony. It is from the Chinese
Consul, and notifies the subjects of
Kong See that in future the United
States laws will apply in the departure
from and arrival of Chinese at this
port. Eighteen iocal Chinese already
have return permits under Hawaiian
laws. Twelve others have qualified in
the same way. The latter must
qualify again or stay at home.
J. K. Brown, the American Chinese
agent sent to Honolulu, accompanied
by Mr. Sewan, called at the Chinese
Bureau on the 25th and notified Mr.
Girvin that American Chinese laws
were already in force and effect. The
bureau had already signed thirty pas
sengers for the Belgic. Mr. Brown
stated that even these must qualify
under United States laws before they
could leave the country.
Prospective passengers have taken
the advice of their Consul and are try
ing to qualify under Mr. Brown at the
custom-house. Only a few have been
able to get through.
Acting upon advice of the Attorney
General, Mr. Girvin has returned the
passports! and money of the twelve men
to whom passports should have been is
sued to-day.
The United States law with respect
to return permits is more severe than
the Hawaiian law. Except in the cas*
of merchants, a Chinese to leave and
return must have a family and be
possessed of property in the country
valued at not less than $1,000.
The Thanksgiving dinner given by
the ladies of Honolulu to the soldiers

gratifying to the boys in blue, who
have found themselves on this day of
| days so far from home and friends.
The engagement of Major Davis,
j Chief Surgeon of the United States
Military Hospital here, and Mrs.
Charles L. Carter has been announced.
