manner in which for ornamental purposes, the
reservations, streets and avenues were laid
out, and the proportion of the property actually
possessed by the general government.
I think the proportion of the expenses of the
government and improvement to be borne by
the general government, the cities of Washington
and Georgetown, and the county,
should be carefully and equitably defined.
In accordance with section 3, act approved
June 23,1874, I appointed a board to make a
survey of the mouth of the Mississippi river,
with a view to determine the best method of obtaining
and maintaining a depth of water sufficient
for the purposes of commerce, &c., and
in accordance with an act entitled an act to provide
for the appointment of a commission of
engineers to investigate and report a permanent
plan for the reclamation of the alluvial
basin of the Mississippi river subject to inundation,
I appointed a commission of engineers.
Neither board has yet completed its
labors. When their reports are received they
will be forwarded to Congress without delay.

After the death of Boerhaave, the most

near being turned into a grim reality at Barnaul's
Hippodrome in New York a few days ;
ago. Amoug the wild animals on exhibition
are a male and female rhinoceros, the first
weighing four thousand five hundred pounds,
and the second three thousand five hundred.
The beasts had just been put into the same
cage, when the male, "Pete," attacked his
female companion, "Mary Jaue," in a most
ferocious manner. The hard, horny noses of
the two animals clashed, and soon the male
struck the female with his horn on the left
side, cutting a deep gash, lifting her about
six feet from the ground, and nearly threw
her over the wall of the pen. An attempt was
made to separate them, but the male made
one furious dash, carried the barricade away,
and agaiu the poor female was raised upon
his horny nose and thrown into the air. The
bellowings of the combatants were echoed by
the roar of the lions, and the fearful laugh of j
the hyenas. The wild beasts scented blood, |
and every cage in the great menagerie was a
scene of wild excitement. The lions and the
tigers, the leopards and the bears, jumped
and howled and roared, and above all arose
the dismal wail of the frightened elephants.
The iron pen was splintered to a mere wreck
during the fight, which lasted an hour and a
half. Before the infuriated male could be
separated from his helpless mate, the latter
was horribly gored and utterly prostrated,
lying on her abdomen on the floor of the cage
quite unresisting.

nessee, like many of their brethren in Mary-\
land and other parts of the South, have arrived
at the salutary conclusion that they will
no longer be the mere tools of political masters.
They have takeu a bold step toward reestablishing
an amicable understanding with |
white citizens, from which they now realize
that they have been bamboozled by the promises,
intimidations and false pretenses of ad-'
venturers. The presidents of the various col- j
ored socitiesof that city haveinaugnrated the
movement by forming an association, the objects
of which are to discard old political ties,
and cultivate and maintain permanent peace j
with the white people of the South. In an [
address which they have issued they set forth
that they have seen and felt and still suffer
under the consequences of the vicious antagonism
into which the "mere fictions of political
incendiaries" have led them. They briug
strong indictments against their despoilers.
"They have shorn us," they say, "of our pecuniary
accumulations, the result of weary
years of toil, even pennies accumulated by
our youth and fledgelings. All this we could
bear, but they have left us despised by our!
only true friends through their knavish repre-!
sentations and unmitigated falsehoods." Such
expressions, at least, show how keenly the colored
people realize their wrongs, now that
their eyes are being opened to fbci.r situation,1
and they give an earnest of their disposition
to regain the uselessly lost confidence of the
past and establish their claims to freedom of
thought and action in all that relates to their
personal and political interests.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The President's message, which we publish
entire this week, is a calm, cautious and with*
- i .1 : i
al conservative document, eviaenuy couceiveu
with the view of pleasing the captious aims of
none of the party leaders, and well calculated
to commend itself to the majority of the American
people. The financial question first occupies
his attention, and he urges upon Congress
the duty and necessity of placing the
currency of the country upon a basis common
to and recognized by the civilized world. In
this portion of his message the President's
views are sound, and will be generally approved.
He advocates the repeal of the legal
tender clause to take effect as to all contracts
entered into after the day fixed iu the repealing
act; a revenue sufficiently in excess of expenditure
to insure an accumulation of gold
in the treasury to sustain resumption ; and
lastly, a system of free banking as essential to
give proper elasticity to the currency.
His reference to affairs in the South is in
more conciliatory terms than might have been
expected from his political surroundings.
While he deprecates the necessity for any executive
interference in the local affairs of the
Southern States, he justifies his recent action
in Louisiana by reference to the failure of Congress
at the last session to act upon the recommendations
of his former messages. As to
the generality of Southern outrages he explicitly
states that the truth is to be looked for
between the statements of two extreme parties
to the transactions, which fact will be conceded
by all. He admits that the Southern
peoplejhave suffered grievous wrongs,and that
the better part of them have a disposition to be
law-abiding and to do no violence either to individuals
or to existing laws ; and further,that
he sympathizes with their prostrate condition,
and would do all in his power to relieve them,
acknowledging that they have had most trying
governments to live under, and very oppressive
ones in the way of taxation. In this view
of the case, all acquainted with the facts will
most heartily concur, while it must be gratifying
to know that light upon this subject has
at length broken upon the presidential mind.
EDUCATION.
In the inaugural address of Gov. Chamberlain,
whilst he advocates retrenchment iu
various particulars, he insists that no reduction
of public expenditures be made by reducing
the appropriations for educational purposes.
There is no question about the general
principle. Money appropriated by a government
for the education of the children and
youth, is a first-class investment. The great
defect with a large portion of South Carolina,
* ? rt 11 .t ri .1 c% 1 _ A _ _ xl A
and in tact or an tne ooutnern otaies, is mat
they are ignorant and care nothing for .education,
and have no just appreciation of the
value of education. The heaviest load South
Carolina has to carry, is the load of crime
which the ignorance of her citizeus heap upou
her. A very large number of the people of
the State do not care one cent whether they
are regarded as honest or dishonest. They
dread punishment for crime, only because of
the smart it causes their bodies. They never
think of the disgrace of being sent to the penitentiary.
In fact, the word disgrace means
nothing with them. Turned out of the penitentiary,
they feel like, and act like a hog
turned out of a pen. They see no reason why
they should hold down their heads.. Now,
the proper and the cheapest way to remedy
this state of things, is to educate the children
and vouth of the country.
lu thecarryiDg out of the common school
system of South Carolina, a grave blunder has
been made. The blind have been made leaders
of the blind, and both are now in the ditch.
There are men teaching school in the State
that are totally unfit. They have no education,
and worse than that, they have no moral
character. This is especially the case with
regard to the colored schools. Unless a
change takes place with respect to the character
and capabilities of the teachers of the col- j
ored schools, this class of our citizens are j
doomed to hopeless ignorance. The revenue
of the State would not avail anything, were it j
all appropriated for educational purposes, so j
long as the schools are taught by such individuals
as the majority of those who are now
in charge of them. In no other respect have j
the colored people been so humbugged and !
bamboozled as with regard to the manage- j
ment of the common school system of the j
State.
PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS.
In the Senate on the 8th, a bill was intro-'
duced to fix the salary of the President at
825,000 after the term of the present incumbent.
Also, a bill authorizing and directing 1

President's salary to ?25,000 ; to extinguish
the Indian title to the Black Hills reserva-,
tion; to substitute United States notes for

of the insurrectionary States granted by the
President during the late war; abolishing the
use of stamps on checks, drafts and other
promises for the payment of money ; for the
payment of all accounts for services rendered
to the Government in the postal service of
the United States prior to 1861; to authorize
free banking and to repeal all laws limiting
circulation under the national bank act; to
regulate elections in the States of North and
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama
and Louisiana; and a bill to amend the enforcement
act, after which the House resolved
itself into a committee of the whole and discussed
the bill for the improvement of the
currency and reduction of interest on the
funded debt.
In the Senate on the 9th, a petition was
presented from the Presidents of the Texas
Pacific and the Atlantis and Pacific railroads,
asking Congress to guarantee the payment of
the interest on the gold-bearing construction
bonds of those companies, and a bill was introduced
to carry out the object of the petition.
In the House, the committee on public
lands was authorized to frame a general
bill for the relief of all the people who suffered
from the grasshopper plague. The
- - i . 1 i T\!_
remainder of the session was aevotea 10 district

appropriating ?30,000 for the purchase of
scales for the use of the post office department
was passed. In the House, Mr. Stowell, of
Virginia,asked an investigation of the charge
made against him of selling a naval cadetship.
The bill for the improvement of the currency
&c.t was considered in committee of the whole.
An amendment was offered that greenbacks
shall not be a legal tender for debts contracted
after July 1, 1875. Several members
spoke at considerable length on the bill.
The Senate was not in session on the 11th.
In the House, the only bill introduced was
one for the relief of settlers on the public
lands who suffered from grasshopper raids.
The bill, which passed, authorizes sufferers to
be absent from their lands without prejudice
to their titles.
In the Senate on the 14th, Mr. Morton
presented a petition of the colored men of
Indiana, protesting against the recent decision
of the Supreme Court of that State, claiming
that by force of that decision, they are
deprived of the rights of citizenship, and their
children of the benefits of an education, and
ttip nrrtnfir law officers of the
?00."'fe v..~ r._r?
Government be directed to appeal the case to
the Supreme Court of the United States; referred
to the judiciary committee. Subsequently,
Morton introduced a joint resolution
directing the Attorney-General to take out a
writ of error from the Supreme Court of Indiana
to the Supreme Court of the United
States?the Government to bear the expense,
as the petitioners were not able to bear it.
Mr. Pratt introduced a bill amendatory of an

Trouble at Vicksburg.
For the past few days the telegraph
has been reporting trouble between the blacks
and whites at Vicksburg. It seems that the
sheriff of that county is a negro, and on account
of alleged malfeasance, the white citizens
had, by threats, forced him to resign
or sign a paper to that effect. As a consequeuce,
the negroes of the county became exasperated
and an armed force of 700 marched
into the city by different roads. Several of
the negroes were killed, and one white citizen
was shot. Governor Ames issued a proclamation
commanding the rioters to disperse,
and quiet has been partially restored. The
Governor has also issued a proclamation calling
an extra session of the Legislature to
assemble to-day for the purpose of taking
some action, on the situation.
The Civil Rights Rill.
The civil rights measure introduced]
by Gen. Butler, came up before the House
committee on the judiciary last Friday. The
recent elections have developed the fact that
it is a delicate question to handle, and a majority
of the committee are out-and-out opposed
to the bill in its present shape, the
most serious objection urged being the mixed
school provision aud the cemetery clause.
In the discussion of the bill by the committee,
Judge White, of Alabama, declared that the
passage of the bill in its present form would
11. .L- ..ii
result iu tut) utter uuumuatiuu ui tuc irepuulicau
party in the South, and that iu the next
election not a single State could be secured
by his party. To obviate the disagreeable
consequences resultiug from the enactment
of the present bill, he submitted to the committee
a substitute, framed in consonance
with the platform of the republican party of
Alabama, which abolishes, the provisions making
criminal prosecutions obligatory upon
the United States officials where the law is
violated, and entirely obviates the inconveniences
resulting from the mixing of the white
and colored races. This substitute was submitted
to the committee for disposition, and
nine members being present, it was by them
adopted. It was agreed, however, not to
press the question at present, but to refer the
whole matter to a sub-committee consisting
of Messrs. Butler, Poland and White.
Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
The views of the chief financial officer
of the nation are of interest alike to all classes.
In his report to the present session of Congress,
the Secretary of the Treasury accords
in his view3 on the financial question -very
nearly with the opinions expressed by the
President in his message. The Secretary is
earnestly in favor of specie payments. He
recommends the repeal of the legal tender act
at a fixed day as to contracts thereafter made ;
the immediate issue ofconvertible bonds bearing
a low rate of interest, and the fixing of a
day for the resumption of specie payments
not more limited than three years, at the end
of which time the secretary to be authorized
to raise gold by selling bonds iu such amounts
as may be necessary from time to time to
keep the treasury in a condition to redeem
greenbacks as presented. As part of the
plan for the resumption of specie payments,
the secretary also favors free banking. He
further recommends the ^displacement of
fractional currency by silver, to accomplish
which he desires all the mints to be set to
work coining silver, and as rapidly as it is
produced to recall the fractional currency.
He also asks that the coinage of gold be
made free, as it is in London, in order to
prevent the exportation of bullion. The secretary
reviews the general workings and
financial operations of the several revenue
bureax at length. In respect to tariff*, without
entering into dicussion, he says that at
present it is only neccessary to treat it purely
as a question of revenue, and not one either
of protection or free trade. He does not think
any change should be hastily made, but if
; Congress pleases to revise the present rates,
and there is much need, he says, for revision,
he recommends the appointment of a commisj
sion to take the whole subject into considera!
tion and report at the next Congress.
The Election of Judge Heed.
! The election of J udge to fill the vacancy on
- the Charleston circuit is the first occasion that
' has been presented for Governor Chamberlain
\ to give proof of the sincerity of his promises
j when inaugurated. There were three candi!
didates for the position before the Legislature?Whipper,
a negro from Barnwell county
; Baker, from Massachusetts ; and Hon. J. |
P. Reed, of Anderson couuty. Whipper and
Baker were run, as is alleged, in the interests
of the Bowen and Whittemore rings, and
while the lecal attainments and qualifications
of the two candidates are not up to the proper
standard, their reputations are likewise not
above reproach. In view of these facts, Governor
Chamberlain warmly espoused the cause
! of Iieed, aud attended a caucus of the party
on Friday night for the purpose of urging his
election. To some persons this action of the
! Governor may appear undignified ; but the
. object attained will fully compensate any comr J
promise of official dignity. Addressing the
caucus, Governor Chamberlain said :
"He desired, if possible, to divest himself of
the influence of Governor, and to appear as a
private citizen to discuss the questions under
consideration. He felt now as he had never
felt before the responsibilities of his position
and of his party. The eyes of the entire State
and nation were upon them, and he had laid
aside every consideration to come here to
speak in behalf of the common welfare of the
State. He disclaimed any desire to use any
influence that did not belong to him as a simple
member of the Republican party. The
only fear that he entertained was whether he
had the courage to do his duty. That duty
! was an uupleasant one, but it must be discharged.
In the selection of a judge of the
; first circuit a man must be selected whose ,
character is above suspicion. If the whole
field were open, and the circumstances were i
such that he could select, from the educated
men of the State, a candidate of ability and
character and learning, he was free to say
that his choice would not fall upon any of the
three candidates named to-night. But he now
proposed only to discuss the merits of the
three candidates named, and to inquire which
one of them came the nearest to the qualifications
ofa judge. There were three qualifications
to be considered. First, the candidate
must be a Republican ; second, he must be a
man of ability, qualified to 611 the position;
and third, his character and iutegrity must be
above suspiciou. It was injustice to the Ke* !
publican party to suppose that they could do i
anything merely because of their numerical
majority. They had seen a majority of forty
thousand dwindle down to ten thousand in the
last campaign under the pressure of just such
mistakes. They had no right under any circumstances
or under any political pressure, to
impose upon any community in this State a
man to administer the laws whose character
and reputation do not entitle him to the full
confidence of every man, woman and child in
the community. He theu compared the qualfications
of the three candidates. He was opposed
to the election of Gen. Whipper or of
Mr. Baker to that position, and it was his
opinion, that of the three candidates named,
the one who best met the requirements of the
position was Col. Reed."
These and similar remarks brought a tirade
of abuse upon the administration from Whipper
and his partisans; but as the vote next
day shows, the Governor commands the
strength of the General Assembly.
The election of Judge Reed is hailed with
satisfaction throughout the State ; and especially
iu Charleston, where his judicial functions

lilt? UUl IV ttuunoii uiu vmvw v/4 ? ? ,MW..Vv,
and to provide for the election of justices of
the peace, and recommended, inasmuch as
this matter has been specially alluded to in
the governor's message, and, under resolution
of the house, referred to the committee on
privileges and elections, that the committee

a favorable report on a bill to relieve
Fairfield county from the provisions of an act

I political opiuions." Recommendation favorable.
The same committee reported favorably on
a bill authorizing and directiug the county
commissioners of the several counties of this
State to make specific appropriations of money
collected for county purposes. Recommendation
favorable.
The rest of the session was chiefly occupied
in debating the liquor license bill?the object
of the bill being mainly to impose upon the
county commissioners the duty of granting licenses,
instead of the grand jury. During the
discussion, Col. Beatty, of York, addressed
the House, which is thus referred to by the
Phccnix:
Ponding the discussion, yesterday, of a bill to
amend an Act to regulate the sale of intoxicating
m>- Knattv. of York, the Nestor of the
Hon so, made a capital point against the inconsistency
ot'passing a resolution to exclude the sale of
| all liquors from tho State House and grounds, and
yet giving additional license and privilege to the
traffic among the people, whose homos it invades
in the most fearful forms. lie indulged in a short
but tolling disquisition upon intemperance, which
lie described as the most universal, all-pervading
and remorselessly destructive evil of the times.
From the days of Sir Matthew Hale, who pointed
out its connection with crime, to the present, it
has been the source of untold crime, wrong and
suffering. As to the law itself, passed only last
March, and just now received and understood in
the counties, he saw no necessity and no advantage
in altering it. It was well enough as it stood.
Tho constant alterations and amendments of laws
lead to confusion and misunderstanding. Tho
best and surest way to secure tho respect of tho
people is to pass good laws, transact tho necessary
public business and go home.
He was in the habit of giving advice to tho colored
people in his county. He summed up his
counsel to them under three heads: That they
should get a home, if it be but one acre of ground;
acquire whatever education was possible for themselves
and for their children, qnd remember the
hole from which they had been digged and avoid
the evils of tho savage condition, the chief of which |
was intoxicating drinje. It was a pleasant episode I
to listen to this veimrablp gentleiqan, as ho incul- |
cated the lessons of virtuoand raised his trembling i
but earnest voice against a habit which ho justly I
regards as deadly and disastrous beyond all others. J

CIRCUIT COURT.
The December term of tbe Circuit Court
for York county closed on Wednesday evening
of last week. The only case tried subsequent
to our report of last week, was that of
the State vs. Nelson Clawson, charged with
the murder of a white man named James
Pressley, near Fort Mill, in September last.
The prisoner was found guilty of murder and
sentenced to be hanged on Friday the 15th of
January, 1875. We learn that his friends
will petition the Governor to commute the
sentence to imprisonment for life.
THE EXAMINATION.
On Tuesday last, the public examination of
the pupils of the Yorkville Female Institute
came off. The day was cold, but withal, very
pleasant. The sky was clear and the streets
were dry and smooth; but notwithstanding
these and many other favorable circumstances,
but few persons attended the examination.
Like the persons who were once invited to a
wedding, all had some excuse for not attending.
The few, however, who were present at
ll a Atrn n\ 1 rn* f i An An ? a **a/1 A mi aU fnanl A n J ill aaa

who did not attend should regret it. A goodly
number of young ladies and misses, with as
bright faces as two eyes ever gazed upon, were
examined on the studies gone over during the
session. These studies embraced geography,
arithmetic, algebra, English grammar, and
English literature. While being examined in
some of the studies, the young ladies spoke
rather low; but on the whole there was but
little ground for complaint on this score.
We were highly pleased with the examination
in arithmetic. Had some of our practical
men been there, they would have learned
some things of great importance to them in
their everyday business. The examination on
arithmetic was thorough, and the young ladies
showed that they thoroughly understood what
they were doing. This is said not as mere
blarney, but as a candid conviction.
The examination was conducted by Prof.
Hubbard and Miss Amanda Moore. The
most perfect order prevailed throughout the
entire examination.
