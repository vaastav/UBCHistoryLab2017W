PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE
A DISTINCT CHALLENGE.
While thrre i but very little in the prosidr -nt's iiips
sa'f that has not hfn unticipitfd for v-ks, it is a
di.tinct chullen-ff to fiiigroh.-i to rrt down to some
much needed h'.:slne., and iuild an Ann rican fabric,
tit for future iiN'-f ulnpss. Instrad of lim; litl a.stray
on the trail :f tho "fr nzied preparedists," I'rcs't Will-on
has outlin"d a program not beyond the possibility
of accept". i by tho n'aonablo jmciti.-'ts. It is a
former ' r.-yoar prorarn reduced to a live-year pro
gram; to ) ' irrid out two years earlier than former
ly antlcipac.d, and that is all. and enough. The means
of doing trlM Is rIvph mu h more t onside. at ion than
what Is t. be done. 4
The f5?!ab!i.shment of a merchants' marine is another
Important demand of the president's riH-ssaue, seem
ingly regarded by him as of at least equal Importance
to preparing for Avar or "defense." as the "jiropared-
Ists" are won't to call it. The merchant marine pro
gram is to be I, ut a revi.-ion of the plan before con
gre:?'3 at the lat session, but advanced as certain to
prove adequate in time to inture us against foreign
advantage ovf r our commerce. War, ac-cordinj? tit the
presitlent, has taught us as never before, the need of
American ships In the transportation of imports; a need
that Is only less reat in limes of peace. Throughout
the message the executive is rivln laryer attention to
the development of our resources and material welfare,
capable of benefitting the whole people, than to a .satis
faction of the "preparedist" seeming thirst for yore.
Which Is exactly as it should be, and. should conjfess
back the president up in his plan for raising the rev
or.ui for increasing and (juippimr the army and navy,
you may rest quite assured that there will be less of a
demand for such increase. If the burden Is made to
fall upon luxuries by dinct taxation, rather than upon
necessities by tariff. or. Imports, the owners of the
luxuries and users of them; folk who are neer called
to do battle or seldom htar such call, will soon be
come very much less interested in having an enormous
"preparedness" prouram put through. We regret that
the president did not. or perhaps could not, for con
stitutional reasons, recommend a tax on war arma
ment, supplies anil munitions calculated for the warring
powers. The constitutional prohibition against duties on
exports probably prevents it. It would be a very pond idea
however, if it could he done, since the manufacturers
of war materials for Kurope. in their demands for a
larger "preparedness" for the Tnited States, seem to
be operating in patriotic disguise, o create a market
for the continuance of such manufacturing- after the
war Is over. In other words, we would favor any tax
for "preparedness'' that would operate as a penalty on
"Kold-plated" patriotism; or patriotism for revenue.
r.ut anyhow, Prcs't Wilson has proven by his mos
?ape that he has not lost his head listening to the
demands for war preparations any more than South
liend. for example, lost its equilibrium yesterday in
observing a ho-called "Defense I)y" by displaying the
American flag. A few Hags were displayed, no doubt
from patriotic motives, while others were not displayed
from the same motives, the majority not caring to
join in the hypocraty represented c the National 1f-
fense league promoters. The American public as the
president's message indicates, and as loivl observance
of "Defense Day'' seems to approve, is ready for a
reasonable "preparedness," but not to be accounted as
vvar trust dupes.
I'qually signiMcant to which is the message's refer
ence to that type of "preparedness" demanded in a
more Americanized Americanism. The operations of
our secret. Internal foes, misusing their American right
to a free press and f rt e speech, is a greater menace to
us to. lay than 1- The possibility of foreign invasion. The
president lias handled this in no uncertain words. An
Americanism dedicated to America, not for revenue,
nor under the false pin tense of preserving American
liberty when as a matter of fact the purpose is to per
vert that liberty and utilize it to assist some outside
power: such an Americanism dedicated to America, we
jay, vsith the president, is among our sorest needs.
Throughout, the message is an cxpresMon of great
American statt smanship. and from such trying times as
thes, will go down in history as anions our sanest
of slate documents.
BLAME THVSELE, MR. PUBLIC;
ROCKEFELLER'S HUMAN.
Deing ju.-t common folk, void of such luxuries as a
motor car, we had not particularly noticed the prices
of gasoline, but the following letter, calling for an
answt-r and proentcd lure instead of in the "Public
I'ulsr" column, s.ivs s-unething is wrong, and based
upon his statemi nt, our comment is appended. Here
is the letter:
I'ditor News-Times; In a little over two
months, the retail price of gasoline has been
ndvanc.vl nearly " .". per cent. The retailer gits
r.o p.rt of this increase. The explanation of
the raw i- that the h.vv price last summer was
made t dr;ve 'at small dealers and, that having
been accomplished.. the raising will be continued
until tbe l.r:air level is reached.

tuen, iü cne of U wLicf occasions of wal Uu-

the publ.c have a look-in before puch increase?
(an be made in the pnee of such everyday ue-e-essities
a gasoline? Kl'ADI.Il.
The public ought not to have anything that it does
not go after.
Manipulation of prices in ord'-r to strangle competition
and establish a monopoly h is been the Standard Oil
To.' favorite play for the past 40 years, as the public
lias long known. That that ;'ine is still played Is the
fault of the publi ". Just as Ls any other condition that's
detrimental to the public.
It is the fashion to berate the Standard methods and
"cuss old Rockefeller" f,,r about every economic out
rat:e that's perpetrated, but neither the Standard r.or
old John is doing more than the public permit?.
A democracy is all right but a democracy -which
holds the power must also hold the accountably.
All us.rs of gayojine are at the mercy of the
Standard Oil Co.. as to th! "necessity." This is well
known. There i.s no need of r. "look-In." The thing
is perfef tly patent. With power to kill competition,
there's nothing to prevent the Standard's raising prices
:.ni) r c ut. It would likely do it. too, only it might
ihus stir the public to doing something radical in its
own behalf. Take all the f at hers off a goose at one
"elk and you'll cause an awful squawking. Pull out
the f, athi rs one at a time and you get them just the
s.tine but without any disturbance or passionate re
sistance. However, as our "Keid.r" indicates, as gaso
line becomes more of a "necessity". Insistence upon
government ownership or regulation will grow stronger.
It is those who monopolii necessities who are doing
the real promoting of socialism. Meanwhile, pay your
gasoline bills, or walk.
GETTING HID OF DIPLOMATS.
It isn't necessary to hold any animosity Against
Taptains IIoy-.Kd and von Papen, the naval and military
attaches of the German embassy whose recall our
government has asked for. Their offenses have been
irritating, but it isn't likely that these gentlemen are
much to blame aa individuals. They have done their
duty as they saw it.
Insofar as they may have ccted on their own Ini
tiative, they are culpable; hut presumably their course
of action ever since they began to carry the war Into
America has been inspired and directed from Berlin.
At any rate, they are the agents of their government,
and the responsibility for their conduct rests with
their government. Their dismissal is therefore a direct
rebuke to the militarist-statesmen of Berlin who have
not scrupled to disregard American sovereignty and
ride rough-shod over American rights.
There will, of course, he an outcry to the effect that
our government discriminates against Teuton diplo
mats. When anybody can point to a representative of
any of the allied powers who has abused our hospital
ity and patience as these gentlemen have done, there
should be no less delay in handing him his passports.
Thus far it has not been shown that any of the allied
nations, or their diplomatic representatives, or their
American sympathizers, have subsidized disloyalty and
crime in the United states or directed a propaganda
against our peace and safety,
Berlin and Vienna should take this lesson to heart,
in a spirit of chastisement rather than indignation. Dr.
Dernberg has gone. Dr. Dumba has gone, Boy-Ed and
von Papen are on their way; we don't want to have
to send any more diplomats back home.
BRITISH PIRACY IN DEALING
WITH AMERICAN TRADE.
We don't mind Britto nia ruling the wave, as long as
she rules it fairly. We don't object to her pre-eminence
in international trade, as long as she gains and
keeps it in fair competition. But we do most seriously
object when she uses her naval power to Increase her
shipping and swell her trade at our expense.
The ci mmandeering of the Hocking nd the Gen
esee for her own use by a friendly and supposedly
honest power is an insolent denial of American prop
erty rights at sea. It is on a par with the German
denial of our rights of life at sea, and only less serious
as property Is subordinate In importance to human
rights, one form of aggression is no more to be tol
erated than the other.
These two ships were bought from a Danish lino
by the American Transatlantic company of Delaware.
Thus there was no taint of belligerent origin. They
passed from one neutral flag to another neutral flag.
Great Britain entered a protest at the time of the
transfer, charging that Germans owned an interest in
the vessels. Our department of commerce rnaae a full
investigation and decided that there was no ground
for refusing to admit the ships to American registry.
That should have settled the matter. Great Britain,
however, seized them at the first opportunity, as she
has seized many other American vessels, and then,
without even awaiting judgment in her own prize
courts, requisitioned them for her own trade.
Xut h action is not only in defiance of American
rights but it is contrary to British law. If the British
government isn't disposed to heed the protests of the
t'uited States, it will do well at least to heed the advice
given in the house of lords by Viscount Bryce, the
former American ambassador, and Bord Bansdowne.
leader of the conservative" party, against abusing their
power under the plea of "necessity."
If the British government means to follow the Barl
of Portsmouth, who urges it to "sweep away all judicial
niceties" and all such "rubbish" as prize court law and
the declaration of London, and resort to "the old 8ea
laws of our ancestors." it is no better than the German
admiralty in its recent, and now repudiated period of
"f rightfulness."
We don't expect the British to act like pirates in
dealing with American shipping. If they persist, there
may be a demand in this country that we act as we did
in 1 1 2. and treat them like pirates.
CANADA'S LOYALTY.
Canada's new $00.000,000 war loan has been over
subscribed to the extent of HiO.OOO.COO. Canada is
Utting out a new army, raising its contribution of
troops to 230. COO. Multiply all the e figures by 15, and
the products will indicate what our own nation would
be contributing to the war If It gave money and men in
the same proposition.
After this, there can't be any question of Canada's
loyalty to the Dritish empire. She may quarrel with
Mother Fncland now .nd then over a tariff rate or a
'iuestion of jurisdiction; but when it comes to a real
test, the "Tipperary" sentiment triumphs, and "her
heart's right there."
ANOTHER BOSS GONE UNDER.
Jim mith. deposed democratic boss of New Jersey,
a: id arch political foe of Fres't Wilson, has gone into
bankruptcy to the tune of $1.730.000.
If you dig down leneath the surface you will find
most political bofses bankrupt. Sometimes the bank
ruptcy take.-- a financial turn, as in this case, but ofteaer
the bosses are bankrupt morally, which is far worse for
their c -editors the public. The sooner the bossing
busin s;-, is broken up the betier it will be for American
polit'es.
The worst thin," about that For?. peace ship Is that
it started a usw crop of fordcar okes.
