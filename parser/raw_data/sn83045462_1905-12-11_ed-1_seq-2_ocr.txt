Arrest of Noted Labor Leader
at St. Petersburg
EAISED A GREAT STORM
INDICATIONS FATEFUL REACTION
IN RUSSIA HAS COME.
Uewspapers to Defy t he Temporary
Press Law?Situation in Livo
nia Frightful.
ST. PETERSHl'RG. Sunday, December
10 (morningl, via Eyrttkuhnen, East Prus
sia, December 11.?There Is every indica
tion this morning that the government's
challenge will be accepted and that within
forty-eight hours a general strike through
out Russia will be ordered. A terrible
?torm has been raised by the arrest of
M. Krustaleff. president of the executive
committee of the workmen's council, which
?was followed during the night by the im
prisonment of the members of the work
men's council and a number of soclalistio
leaders.
"The reaction has come," were the words
on every lip and in the liberal extremist
camp there was only one opinion, namely,
that it must be resisted to the bitter end.
At all the meetings last night, some of
?which lasted until morning, the opinion was
unanimous that the government had forced
the hands of the proletariat and that the
supreme weapon, a general strike, must be
invoked.
The newspaper editors at yesterday even
ing's meeting decided that the temporary
press law forbidding the discussion of vital
questions affecting the welfare of the na
tion violated the principles of freedom of
speech and of the press guaranteed by the
Imperial manifesto and that it must be de
fled. The result was that the editions of
the Ru^s and half a dozen more radical
papere were confiscated.
The employes of the Riga-Orel railroad
have declared a strike on account of the
declaration of martial law In Livonia and
have sent an appeal to the other roads to
Join. I.ast night the railroad men of the
Baltic lines decided to follow the exam
ple of the Riga-Orel men.
Anarchy in Livonia.
The situation In Livonia Is frightful.
Absolute anarchy prevails. A messenger
?who arrived here this morning declared
that the streets of Riga were flowing
with blood. After a meeting the railroad
men of Riga were mowed down by the
fire of machine guns and artillery.
The railroad men of St. Petersburg, at a
meeting yesterday evening, resolved that
inasmuch "as the reaction is gaining
force and the government Is seeking to
retract what was won by the first pan
It. usstnn strike," the railroad men stand
ready to obey the signal for a general
strike, but advise their fellow workers to
await the word from the ctentral commit
tee at Moscow, as a failure must not be
risked.
Wholesale Arrests at Moscow.
Simultaneously with the arrests here M.
Dronshllny and all the members of the
?union of the employes of the posts and
telegraph operators of Moscow, with M.
Kokhanowsk! at their head, were arrested
at Moscow.
Interior Minister Durnovo today Issued an
official proclamation not only notifying all
the post and telegraph employes that their
failure to return to work tomorrow will be
equivalent to their discharge, but that all
those who agitate for a continuance of the
strike or are guilty of cutting or otherwise
destroying wires and apparatus will be
prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
TO AVERT A CRISIS.
Chief Financiers of St. Petersburg Will
Petition Witte.
8pivlol Cablegram to The Star.
LONDON, December 11.?A dispatch to
the Exchange Telegraph Company from St.
Petersburg says that the chief financiers
of St. Petersburg have decided to address
a manifesto to Count Witte urging him to
summon the national assembly, as a finan
cial crisis Is Imminent. Advices from the
provinces indicate that an appalling finan
cial crisis is at hand. Many first-class busi
ness firms have been ruined.
It Is stated that Minister of Interior Dur
ncvo has ordered the dismissal of the tele
graph and postal officials who are members
of the union which recently declared a
strike.
STORM-BOUND SHIPS OFP.
Aragon and Barge Still Ashore on
Carolina Coast.
NORFOLK, Va., December 11.?With
clearing weather and favorable winds a
large number of sailing vessels which had
been storm-bound In Hampton Roads put to
sea today. The steamer Aragon and the
barge Ooddard, which stranded Saturday
cn the North Carolina coast, are still

dition, but the Goddard is reported to be
In bad shape.
Numerous reports of havoc wrought by
Saturday's storm came in today. The
schooner Harry C. Shepherd, bound from i
Norfolk to New York, lunvber-laden. return
ed, leaking badly, and she probably will be
compelled to unload her deckload of lumber.
The Norfolk-North Carolina packet steam
er Tourist is ashore in the southern branch
' of the Elizabeth river, and tugs have pulled
unsuccessfully in an effort to float her.
Capt. John Marshal of the coasting
schooner Charles T. Strann was today
brought to St. Vincent's Hospital with in
juries received during the storm while the
Strann was at anchor in Chesapeake bay.
The tug Ida has been towed here by the
fug Sallie, having been caught In the storm,
when she lost a raft of logs and then had
her propeller damaged.

COMMIITEE CHANGES
'Few in Those of Important
Chairmanships.
TAWNEY - BARTHOLDT
WERE REALLY THE ONLY TWO;
THE FORMES PREDICTED.
Mr. McCleary Satisfied With His
Transfer to the Ways and
Means Body.
The make-up of the House committees
shows very few changes in the chairman
ship of important committees. In fact there
are only two among, the most coveted chair,
manships. appropriations and public build
ings and grounds. Mr. Tawney gets the
former, as was forecasted la The Star last
summer, and Mr. Bartholdt of Missouri
falls heir to the latter in regular order or
succcsslon.
The nomination of Mr. Tawney to the
head of appropriations was accomplished
James A. Tawney,
Chairman Appropriations Committee,
by the transfer of Mi'. McCleafy to ways
and means, a change which Speaker Can
lion desired on account of Mr. McCleary'a
exceptional fitness ns an economist and tils
pronounced high protection views. Mr,
McCleary was placed high on the list of
ways and means, coming immediately alter
the oldest men in service on the committee,
Payne, Dalzell and Grosvenor.
Mr. McCleary Satisfied.
"I am entirely satisfied with the arrange
ment." said Mr. McCleary this afternoon.
"I am very much more interested In the
wise solution of great national problems
than in the details of appropriations. At
the same time, my six years of experience
on the committee on appropriations will en
able me to keep an Intelligent watch on
public expenditures.
"Ever since the battle for the gold stand
ard was fought and won I have been desir
ous of becoming a member of the com
' rnlttee on ways and means, which frames
all tariff bills and other revenue legisla
tion, and which can therefore so greatly
affect for weal or woe ail the people of tile
country. But Mr. Tawney was on that
committee, and. of course, X would not al
low myself to antagonize him in his com
mittee assignments. Now my way Is clear.
And at this time, when the fundamental
principles of wise tariff legislation seem to
require clear and vigorous restatement and
unflinching application, I am convinced
Richard Bartholdt,
Chairman Committee on Public Buildings and
Q round*.
that Speaker Cannon is right In urging that
a duty to the country much higher and
more Important tlian that possible even as
chairman of the committee on appropria
tions calls me to the committee on ways
and means. And where my duty lies, there
I go cheeerfully.
"On the waya and means committee 1
shall have better opportunity than ever to
help protect the Interests of the entire
country, and especially those of the farm
ers of the central part of the continent,
whoee Interests seem to be at this time the
special objects of attack by certain power
ful elements in Boston, Montreal and else
where. ?
"I am glad that the chairmanship of the
appropriations committee comes to Minne
sota. Mr. Tawney is an intelligent and In
dustrious man. While he has had no ex
perience In framing appropriation bills, and
has practically everything to learn In that
line, I hope that In due time he will master
the difficulties and perform the duties of
the position with honor to himself, credit
to the state and profit to the country."
Mr. MoCleay retains the chairmanship of
the library committee.
Other Chtairmanship Changes.
Other chairmanship changes were as fol
lows: Pacific railways, Thomas 8. Butler
of Pennsylvania, vice W. A. Smith, trans
ferred to membership on ways and means;

TO RAISE BRONZE TABLET.
Lincoln's Gettysburg Address to Be
Perpetuated in Metal.
Secretary Taft returned to Washington
this morning from GettyBburg, Pa., where
he went to select a site for the location
of the bronze tablet ordered to be erected
there by Congress to perpetuate the famous
memorial address delivered on that battle
field by President Lincoln in July, ISftl.
The secretary was accompanied by Gen.
J. R. Brooke. XT. S. A., retired Judge Advo
cato General George B. Davis, Col. Nichol
son of the Gettysburg Park commission and
Representative DeArmond of Missouri.
Is expected that Secretary Taft will
nce action in a few days. The
tablet cannot be erected on the spot where
mnraTf President stood on that me
morable occasion for the reason that It
iom^ occupied by a monument to
some of the soldiers who fell In the battle.
AFFAIRS OF VENEZUELA.
It is Expected That the President Will
Send a Message to Congress.
It Is expected that the President will
make the recent diplomatic correspond
ence with the government of Venezuela in
regard to .the disputed claim of the Xew
York & Bermudez Asphalt Co. against the
Venezuelan government the subject of a
special message to Congress. This Is given
as a plausible explanation of the reason
for the omission of any reference to the
controversy by President Roosevelt in his
regular message to Congress.
Another reason given for the delay In
submitting this matter to the legislative
branch is that the President la awaiting
the detailed report of Mr. Calhoun, the
special eoromissloner sent to Venezuela to
make a thorougW personal Investigation of
the matters In dispute between the United

SECRET CONSISTORY AT ROME.
The Second Function, of Present Pope's
Pontificate.
ROME, December 11.?The pope today
held a .?ecret consistory, which was the sec
ond of his pontificate, In which he created
new cardinals, and apparently showed a
tendency to have a better equilibrium be
iween the foreign and Italian elements In
the sacred college, as three of the four
new cardinals are foreigners. The cere
mony was performed with the usual pomp
Nearly thirty cardinals were present. Tito
pontiff appeared walking and preeeeded,
surrounded and followed by the gorgeous
pontifical court. Then all withdrew ex
cept the members of the sacred college and
the pope read his allocution. In it he 6aid
he wished he could give' the -cardinals
pleasant and consoling news, but the con
ditions at the present tlm^ do not permit
of consolation. Although, he continued, the
Catholic faith Is spreading more and more
throughout the world, especially in dissi
dent countries, on turning toward Catho
lic nations one feels sadness and fear lest
the prediction of the Scriptures Is being
verified, that the kingdom of the Lord will
be removed to other people, where It will
produce good fruit. Es>peclal care and
anxiety may be felt for the country here
tofore called the eldest daughter of the
churoh, but concerning the anti-Catholic
laws passed there agalnsrt the laws of jus
tice, the pope said he would speak in ac
cordance with his apostolic office more
gravely and more fully at an opportune
time. He exhorted the cardinals to prayer,
recalling that the Lord will cause tran
quility and peace to shine forth at the
proper time.
The pontiff ended with saying that he in
tends to honor the whole Latin-American
race by creating for tho first time a cardi
nal belonging to that part of the world.
Immediately after reading his allocution
he created the following cardinals;
The most Rev. Joseph Samassa, arch
bishop of Erlnu, Hungary.
Mgr Spinola, archbishop of Seville.
Mgr. J. A. DeArcoverde d? Albuquerque
Cavalcanti, archbishop of Rio Janeiro.
Mgr. ('againo de Azevedo, major domo of
the Vatican.
The cardinals asserted that, contrary to
the popular Impression, the pope did not
create a fifth cardinal, but reserved the
appointment In pectore.
Later the pope appointed a number of
bishops. Including the following: The Rev.
G. Barln, bishop of Nueva Caceres, Philip
pine Islands; the Rev. T. Meerschaert,
bishop of Oklahoma: the Rev. T. Brennan,
formerly bishop of Dalles, Tex., titular
bishop of Cassarea, and the Rev. A. Bchln
ner, bishop of Superior, Wis.
Mgr. Nozaleda. formerly archbishop of
Manila, afterward archbishop of Valencia,
which post he resigned, was nominated tit
ular archbishop of Petra.

Home Life Affairs Before In
vestigating Committee
NEW YORK CITY TODAY
PRESIDENT IDE ON THE STAND
EXPLAINED OPERATIONS.
Declared He Carried No Life Policies?
Officials of tlie Company Shared
Commissions.
NEW YORK, December 11.?An investi
gation of the affairs of the Home Ulfo In
surance Company of New York was taken
tip by the legislative insurance investigat
ing committee torlay. The first witness
called was George E. I<le, president of that
company.
Personally lie carried no life insurance,
he said, but he thought some of the officiate
of his company may have received commis
sions on their own policies. He was asked
by Charles E. Hughes, counsel for the com
mittee, to furnish a list of them.
Mr. Ide said his company is paying a pen.
sion of $1,0<J0 a year to a clerk who was
employed since the foundation of the com
pany, and is now unable to work.
Mr. Ide described the financial operation
of his company, and suid it makes invest
ments In stocks and bonds through ono
firm of brokers, and pays them the regu
lar commission of one-eighth of 1 per cent.
The surplus of his company has been
held at about $1,123,000 for twenty years,
because he regards that as sufficient and
he felt that policyholders are entitled to
the accumulations on their policies.
Mr. Hughes said all but 11 per cent of
the company's business is on deferred div
idend policies. Mr. Ide said the dividends
are paid annually to policies so stipulating,
but on others the accumulations are ap
portioned to each policy each year. The
present amount of that accumulation is
$1,21)0,000.
A policy holder who requests It is told
wlk&t amount of dividends Is credited to his
pollqy each year. Mr. Ide described in de
tail his company's method of finding and
crediting these dividends.
An Annual Expose.
Mr. Ide said this practice of making an
annual statement is "an annual expose"
of the conduct of the company's business,
and is embarrassing to him. Assemblyman
Cox by questions elicited from Mr. Ide that
this Is a salutary check on the payment of
the high commissions for new business, and
nmkes it difficult to secure new business
as compared to other companies which do
not make this annual expose.
Mr. Hughes read and questioned the wit
ness about a circular which Mr. Ide had
issued recently in wihich he said the de
ferred dividends plan causes the accumu
lation of a bdg surplus wtiich, In lids opln
oln, leads to a lax and extravagant condi
tion of business because the company Is not
compelled to account to the policy holder
until Ws policy matures. Mr. Ide snid his
company nias met that condition by making
its annual accounting to the policy holders.
WINTER DRILLS OF WARSHIPS.
Display of the North Atlantic Fleet to
Be Imposing.
Special Dispatch to The Star.
PORTSMOUTH, Va., December 11.?The
winter drills of the North Atlantic fleet
will be this year the most Interesting and
the display of naval strength the most Im
posing that has ever before been possible
with the American navy.
The battleships Iowa and Kentucky, now
undergoing repairs at the navy yard in this
city will Rendezvous in Hampton Roads on
the tith of January, with the most magnifi
cent fleet ever assembled under the Ameri
can flag. There will be two battleship
squadrons, a flotilla of destroyers and an
other division which for lack of ships has
never before appeared In the evolutions.
Heretofore the only armored cruisers we
have had In commission have been the New
York and Brooklyn, and on account of their
comfort and speed they have usually been
assigned to the various squadrons as flag
ships. Now, at last, however, there is a
distinct squadron of armored cruisers, un
der command of Rear Admiral Brownson,
the officer who won fame at Rio de Ja
neiro with the little Detroit.
The plans now contemplate an elaborate
series of drills at sea, which will continue
from the time the fleet departs from Hamp
ton Roads, after an Inspection here by the
Secretary of the Navy and Admiral Dewey,
to the time it starts north from the Car
ibbean in the spring.
Every vessel of the powerful fleet Is be
ing put In flrst-class trim at the various
navy yards, and when Admiral Dewey takes
command in the south he will have under
him an Invincible fighting force of twelve
I armored ships of battleship and cruiser
class, and with the addition of the destroy
ers and the cruisers, a fleet numerically
stronger than the entire American navy at
the outbreak of the Spanish-American war.
The rendezvous of the fleet in Hampton
Roads will of Itself be one of the most im
posing naval spectacles of modern times,
and this will be the only opportunity afford
ed the people of thiB country to see their
navy assembled In full force. Therefore It
Is believed that there will be many visitors
here in January.

Alleged Alarming Conditions From
Tariff Restrictions.
CHICAGO. December 11.?Some alarming
conditions which are rapidly driving large
manufacturing Interests from the United
States to Canada are to be considered with
in a few days by the Illinois Manufacturers'
Association.
Reports Just gathered show that 132 of

headquarters In Chicago.
The resultTftg loss financially Is estimated
at upward of 160,000,000, of which .amount
Chicago Is represented in the statistics to
have suffered a large proportion. The agita
tion "which the Illinois Manufacturers ar?
about to start is expected to assume a form
shortly of a national appeal to Congress.
The remedy most In favor locally and
throughout tta country provides for reci
procity legislation which will permit of the
freer exchange of American and Canadian
manufactured products.
It is likely that Congress will be asked
during the present session to take some
steps in this direction.

NEWPORT, R, I., Dfcmbfr 11 A ha'IW
finished message, sent Just before the bat*
terles are supposed to have become
hausted. came here by wireless from tli?
Nantucket lightship early today, asking fop
"help from anywhere." The message wr.|
timed 2 a.m. and was as follows:
"Nantucket Shoals lightship In di*;re?%
Send help from anywhere "
Hero the message broke off.
The United States gunboat Hist !?=? f; her?
for the lightship at <5 a.m. today.
The wind Is west northwest and moder?
ate. The sea U subsiding
As the lightship*s design Includes water*
tight compartments, intended to save nef
in Just such si res < as she is now in, the
lighthouse officials declare that there wHl
be little difficulty on the part of her <re^
In keeping her afloat until old can ivgcS
her. The lighthouse tender Azalea, whlctt
left New Bedford at 7 .'a> o'clock Inst nlghtV
should reach the vicinity of the HgMshlp
during this forenoon.
When wireless messages were received at
the naval torpedo station here yeslerda^
from tho lightship reporting that sue had
sprung a leak aid th.it the water \rag
steadily gaining, the officials prepated t0>
send help. The gunboat lllst wns ordered
to rroceed to th? srene, but as she wal
about to star; a defect in her steering gear
was discovered, whi< i made it neccss; irV
for her to liavr; repairs made Immediately
\\ ord then was s.-nt to New H< dford?
where the lighthouse tender Azalea was !W
ir.g, and that ves.-el >vas dispatched ? t.1#
lightship.
Gunboat Off Cor Rescue.
Early today the steering gear of the Hist
j again was In proper shape and at 0 <> elooJl
I she left the naval training station nndeF
orders to maJie the best possible speed Id
the lightship.
The distance she will havs to cover Ul
about ninety-seven miles.
I The leak In the lightship's hull, while no*
| definitely located, according to the latest
messages, was apparently Just above tha
fire room plates. So rapidly* did the. wattf
come In, although the pumps were kept
constantly at work, that lata yesterday aft*
ernoon the Are room was flooded and th#
fires had been extinguished. Wlrelfc.
munlcatlon then ceased, and It was sub
posed that nothting further would be hear
directly from the vessel, as the dynamo
probably had given out. Early today, how
ever, came the brier, apparently unfinished
message, again asking for aid. This timely
Is thought the wireless system must hav?
become completely crippled.
The wind shifted to northwest late yester*
day, and this had the effect of causing th?
great seas to moderate sensibly, so that le?#
anxiety was felt here tills forenoon for tlx#
lightship's safety.
On board the lightship are Capt. Jorgetw
son of Dennis, Mass.. commanding; two ca*
glneers, three naval electricians, operating
the wireless apparatus, and eight seamen.

lation in the Senate today preclptta'ed
a bill Introduced by Mr. Tillman wliloh
he explained gave the interstate commerC?
commission power 'to lix a maximum rea?
sonable rate. Mr. Foraker talked at sonii
length on the railroad question. He Insist/*
ed that the Tillman bill recognized that rtm
bates had stopped or could be under thj|
present law.
Mr. Tillman said he did think so until
the Investigation of Judson and Harmon
Instituted by the Executive had been sucH
a miserable fiasco. The present law would

tures of proposed rate legislation.
Mr. Foraker insisted that Congress !itL<J
no authority to delegate to a commission
the right to regulate railroad rates.

sue with Mr. Foraker on this point.

Court had not decided that Congress call
lay down a certain rule and authorize ft
commission to apply this rule to speclflQ
cases, and If U would not apply to a del?e
gation of the power to fix rates.
Mr. Foraker did not think such to be tin*
case.
Mr. Tillman said he had provoked tb?
