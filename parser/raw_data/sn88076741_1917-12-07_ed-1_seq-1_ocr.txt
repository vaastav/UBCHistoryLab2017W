#HE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
Practically a four days continuous
battle in the Cambrai locality was waged
by the Germans in an effort to regain
the territory lost by them to the British
two weeks ago. Ground was gained and
lost by both sides and the battle closed
with the British holding about all they
had previously gained. From present
reports perhaps it was the most sanguin
ary battle of the war, as the Germans
came on in solid masses intending to
drive the British back through mere
force of numbers. Losses on both sides
wer.e very heavy but as usual numbers
arev only guess-work. Some American
engineers who were building railways
close up to the front were caught in the
rush, but dropped their spades and took
muskets and fought with the British
and some of these were killed and
wounded. The strategical importance
of the gains made by the British near
Cambrai has thus been attested, the
sacrificed of many German lives, the
eleven h«avy assaults on eighteen mile
front in the attempt to regain tbe lost
positions. In Italy both sides continue
to bring, up reinforcements of men and
guns probably preparatory tof a great
battle. The Germans are undoubtedly
hurrying up their big gun from the rear
as in a short time the mountain passes
will be filled with snows that will pre
vent passage.
The President's message to Congress
whish was delivere4 this week at the
opening of that body has for its chief
idea that we should at once declare war
against Austria-Hungary. This would
to a great extent be but a formality of
course because if we arei at. war with
Germay we are also at war with all pro
vinces that belong to Germany a^d
Austro-Hungary is at present practi
cally but a German state.
The message also makes same sharp
criticisms about^the war policies,of Ger
many and shows up the dupioity of its
diplomats and diplomatic relations.
Russia of which we write elsewhere
has through its, Petrograd governments
made an armistioe of two days with the
Germans. This is also but a form as
(here hat been practioalty
a
cessation of
fighting, between the German and Bos
sianforces for about two months.
Meantime we.now know that there are
many thousands of American soldiers in
France. Hpw ,m«ny is only gueBS, but
j^-it is probable that the most of the re
gulara and a large part of the national
guard are either then or are on: their
w»y. po«riblyt thi0 feot is one reason
that the President haa asked Congress
to declare. wfcr an Au*tr}a. Otherwise

RUSSIA.
"The wind bloweth where it listeth and
no man knows wither it goes or wheqee
it comes." Russia greater in territory
than all the rest of Europe, whose, total
population probably equals any three of
her largest neighbors, is today a giant
in frame and a child in available strength.
The world has been and is now look
ing on with wonder not to say amaze
ment, at the developments there. The
world is also looking with fear and hor
ror at possibilities that may occur there.
When the forces of hnman nature run
riot it is as if the winds appear to cut
loose from ordinary bounds with oyclon
ic effects.
If the revolution had but changed the
form of government, order and organiza
tion might still have been^reserved.
Even yet if the present sort of govern
ment showed real strength, order may
still remain, but in the upheaval the
very dregs of socialism and anarchy
have come to the top and apparently
now represent and stand for a new Rus
sia. This new Russia with a proposed
constitutian that if carried into effect
will make an equal division of all pro
perty without reference to previous
ownership, is something so entirely dif
ferent from anything the world has
hitherto seen that everybody is wonder
ing what will come of it.
That Russia of all nations, one of the
most ignorant, should thus step so far in
advance, if such doctrine is an advance,
is certainly remarkable in itself, though
perhaps it may be just the swing of the
political pendulem from an absolute
monarchy to absolute individuality. As
to whether "a nation so conceived and
so constituted can long endure" tew peo
ple out of Russia believe, and whether
many people in Russia so believe as yet
we do not know.
It must be remembered that so far no
news of the actual sentiments among the
people of Russia has been allowed to
pass the censors. All stones come from
"the government." Enough however
escapes by different channels to show
that the "empire" appears to be rapidly
disintegrating into factions and frag
ments.
Finland, Siberia, Poland, southern
Russia, Caucasius, and perhaps more of
the provinces have either made actual
advances towards independence or are
talking about autonomy.
All this has to do with the present
negotiations for peace between the Pet
rograd Socialists and the Germans.
Whether these will be able to control
the whole or even a great part of Russia
remains to be seen. The desire for peace
is very great, not only in Russia but in
all the warring nations. Properly man
ipulated this might give openings that
possibly might lead to peace for the
whole world. While the kaiser probably
knows with ffhom he is dealing even
better than anyone else, he has a some
what difficult task before him in his
dealings with the Russian situation.
One necessity will be that to a certain
extent at least he must show his band.
In order to have pea:e both sides must
be willing to compromise. Whatever
terms the kaiser may make with Russia
will necessarily have a strong bearing on
his terms with other nations when the
time comes to treat with them.
On tbe other hand, the Petrograd
government has practically undertaken
to make peace for all the warring nations
without asking their consent or repre
sentation. The Petrograd people are at
tempting to work out tbe whole situa
tion on tbe Russian basis, to-wit, to
ignore all authority, and appeal directly
to the common soldiers and the common
population of all Countries.
All that is necessary to stop the fight
ing and bloodshed is to persuade the sol
diers to come out bf the trenches and go
to their respective homes. Theoretical
ly that is absolutely true. Practically
everybody knows that the soldiers will
not. do it.—at least Boldiers other., than
Russians and they are not all willing.
The intelligent soldiers know that the
Russian proposition if carried out would
be simply jumping out of the frying pan
into the fire. They know that authority
is necessary for liberty. That anarchy
is not democracy^ That eztr eme social
ism is but the other extreme from auto
cracy. They know they are-fighting for
neither anarchy nor autocracy, but for
democracy^ whioh in the tinal analysis is
conservative and not extreme.
Just now however, we have tbe strang
est spectacle^ of history, by which the

At this time they would be glad to
have any suggestions with regard to
moditications of the Federal grain grad
ing rules.
I therefore, suggest that as many
farmers, as possible, who feel that the
present system of grain grading works
to their disadvantage, should be pres
ent and heard at.that time.
I trust that there may be a good re
presentation of farmers and of business
men who feel that the present system
or wheat grading might be improved or
so modified as to afford greater degree
of justic to our wheat growers.
E.F. LADD,
State Grain Inspector.
Undoubtedly no olher army ever mo
bilized contained so many men who are
graduates of colleges and higher schools
as the present A merican forces. All one
ha3 to do is to just list in his own mind
the names of the men who have gone or
who are on their way, and think who
they are educationally. Tbe percentage
of college men, either in reference to the
total college stndent body, or even to
the total forces of the army is very large
while nearly all are soldiers and sailors
at least common or high school graduat
es. As an instance, from the city en
gineer's office in the comparatively small
city of Fargo, twenty-one young men,
all civil engineer?, have volunteered and
doubtless this is not a very exceptiona
case. Education makes a man a think,
er and a reader. Because he is a think
er he realizes his duty sooner and strong
er than the uneducated. He goes to
the front because he realizes that his
country needs his personal services.
That is, from pure patriotism. Many of
them leave good salaries and tine pros
pects, Personally, we believe that an
army so composed must be tbe best
army the world has ever seen. Ger
many has a great military machine but
it is machanical, the American army is
composed of individual machine#- which
are self-aoting atomatoms, whioh can
and will act in unison because of com
mon parpose and intelligent patriotism

How to Preserve Meat When Hunting
la Told by Hunter.
We cut plenty of meat from both the.
sheep agd were busy most of the next
two days caring for our trophies and
drying meat. The sheep and bear skins
had to be scraped, the fat carefully
removed, the skin stretched out to dry.
Fortunately the weather was clear and
the sun hot, so that the drying was
quickly and well done. We cut a great
4eal of both sheep and bear meat into
strips and hung it on a rack that we
rigged near the Are, where it would
iatch the sun and also receive artificial
tie.'it as well. Meat dried in this way
.will last indefinitely, and, though the
flavor is not much to boast of, the
meat is nourishing and goes well in
•,'mulligans" and similar concoctions.
For my people at home I also dried a
ew poundg of both sheep and bear
•neat according to Dr. Hornaday's rec
ipe—that is. I first rubbed on the raw
meat a mixture of black pepper, all
spice and salt, after which I dried the
strips in the sun.—-Paul L. Haworth in

former years. But don't be despondent. Don't give

you possibly can, especially the soldier boys at the
front and in camps and the children at home. It is
easy to make them happy and it does not cost a great
