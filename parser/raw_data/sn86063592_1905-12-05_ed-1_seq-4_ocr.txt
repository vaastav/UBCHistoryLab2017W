deeply Interested In the utterances
on statehood and on railway rate regu
la t Ion than In any other, matter treat
ed of. The president, as we predicted
has declared for joint statehood for
New Mexico and Arizona. Neverthe
less- It Is extremely doubtful. if con
greas will pass the DcverSdge joint
statehood bill, and It Is also extremely
doubtful If New Mexico and Arizona
will vote In favor of the adoption of
joint statehood constitution if con
gress does pass the measure. The
status of the statehood question has
not been materially changed by. the
president's utterances.
Aa was anticipated the president ad
vocates the appointment of some com
mission clothed by the government
with the power to fix a maximum
railroad rate.
We yield to none In our admiration of
, the character of President Roosevelt
We admire his outspoken honesty,
his force, his earnestness, his high
ideals, his stalwart Americanism,
while we do not always agree with
his conclusions. We do not believe
that any government -commission
should nave the right to ran the bust
sees of a private corporation, to say
what that corporation shall 'charge
Jts patrons. " .. - -
The president la much against gov
ernmrnt ownership of railroads.- Yet
It would be more logical and probably
less dangerous for a government to
own the railroads than arbitrarily to
conduct the business of the railroads
whilo others own the Interests. Laws
against rebates and discriminations
are undoubtedly within the province
of the government. Fixing a maxi
mum rate is not. If this Is Indeed the
democratc government we profess..
It Is doubtful if congress and the
people of this1 country will sanction a
rate fixing commission.
f THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
Las' Vegas has a well filled public
library, housed In an attractive build
and It Is patronized every day and
every evening b many Las Vegans and
many visitors. There is no Institution
of the city that is yielding a tithe of
the returns on the Investment that the
public library dots. The library is a
school out of school for the adults, a
.source of profit and pleasure to the
school student, a comfort to the
stranger within our gates, a delight
to both old and young In the city, and
it costs, or Is supposed to cost, the
city a thousand dollars a year for
support
There is something the matter with
a city of the size of Las Vegas that
can't spend a thousand dollars a year
on a public library without haggling
and quarreling over It. It would be
aa everlasting disgrace to allow the
doors of the public library' to close
for want of support. It Is reproacb
enocgh to allow the Institution to get
'Into debt. A thousand dollars a year
baa been voted by the city council for
the support of the library and the
amount should be paid promptly.

the counes of the wise and good in
preference to the flattery of knaves."
Society cannot exist unless a controll

placed romewhere, and the less of It
there be within, the more there must
be without, it Is ordained In the eter
nal constitution of things that men of
Intemperate minds can not be free.
Their passions forge their fetters.
Insurance.
The great Insurance companies af
ford striking examples of corporation?
whose business has Extended so far
beyoftd the jurisdiction of the states
which created them as to preclude
strict enforcement of supervision and
regulation by the parent states. In
my last annual message I recommend
ei 'that the congress carefully con
aider whether the power of the bureau
of corporations can not constitutional
ly be extended to cover Interstate
transactions in Insurance." Recent
events have emphasized the import
a nee of an early and exhaustive con
siaeration or tnis question, to see
whether it Is not DoaMble to furnish
better safeguards than the several
states have been able to furnish
against corruption of the flagrant kind
which has been exposed. It has been
only too clearly ahown that certala
ot the men at the head of these large
corporations take but small note of
the ethical distinction between hon
esty and dishonesty; they draw the
line only this eide of what may be
called law-honesty, the kind of hon
esty in order to avoid falling Into the
clutches of the law. Of course the
only complete remedy for this condi
tion must be found In an aronsed pub
lic conscience, a higher sense of ethi
cal conduct in the community at large,
and especially among business men
and in the great profession of the law,
and In the growth of a spirit which
condemns all dishonesty, whether In
rich man or In poor man, whether It
takes the shape of bribery or of black
mall. But much can be done by legis
lation which Is not only drastic but
practical. There Is neod of, a far
stricter and more uniform regulation
of the vast Insurance interests of this
country. The United States should in
this" respect Mlow the policy of oth
er nations by providing adequate na
tional supervision of commercial Inter-
which re clearly national In
character. My preieecssors have re
peatedly recognized that the foreign
business of these companies Is an Im
portant pnrt of ur foreign commer
cial relations. During th? administra
tions of Presidents Cleveland, Harri
son, and McKinley, the tnte depart
ment exercised its influence, through
diplomatic channels, to prevent unjust
Incrimination by foreign countries
against American Insurance compan
ies. These negotiations Illustrate the
iroprlcty of the congress recognizing
he nnilonat character nf InMtrnnre.
'or in the absence of federal legisla
tion the stnte department could only
live expression to the wlhes of the
authorities of the several tates, whose
policy was ineffective through want of
uniformity.
I reneat my previous recommenda
tion t tint t.V congrets shDuld consid
er whether the federal government has
iny power or owes any duty with re
spect to domestic transactions In In
surance of en Interstate character.
That state supervision has proved
'nadqtiate l generally conceded. The
burden upon insurance companies and
therefore their policy holders, of con
flicting regulations of many states. Is
unqueMoned, 'tille but little effec
tive check is Imposed upon any able
and unscrupulous man who desires to
xploit the company in his own Inter
wt at the expense of the policy, hold
ers and of the public. The Inability
of a sta e to regulate effectively in
surance corporations created under
the Irws of -other states and trans
acting the larger. part of their busi
ness elsewhere Is also clear. As a
remedy for thl. evil of conflicting. In
fective, and yet burdensome regula
tions there has been for many yrars a

the congress should carefully consid
er whether further legislation can be
had. What Is said above applies wtth'
equal force to fraternal and benevo
lent organizations which contract for
life insurance.
The Revenues.
There Is more need of stability than
of the attempt to attain an Ideal per
fectlon in the method's of raring reve-
nue; and the shock and strain to the
business world certain to attend any
serious change In these methods ren
der uch change inadvisuble unless for
grave reason. It is not possible to lay
down any genera rule by which to
determine the monitnt when the rea
sons for, will outweigh the reasons
against such a change. Much must ce
penl, not merely on the needs, but on
the desires, of the people as a whole;
for needs and dsslres are not necess-a
illy identical. Of course no change
can be made on lines beneficial to, or
desired by, one section or one state
only. There must be something like
a general agreement among the citi
zens of the several states, as rep
resented In the congress, that the
change Is needed and desired In the
Interest of the people as a whole;
and there should then be a sincere,
Intelligent, and disinterested effort to
make it In such shape a will com
bine, so far as possible, the max!
mum of good to the people at large
with the minimum of necessary dlare
gard for the pedal interests of lo
calities -or classes. Bui In time of
peace the revenue must on the ave
rage, taking a series of years togeth-
er, equal the expenditures or elfe
the revenues must be Increased: Last
year there was a deficit Unless our
expenditures can be kept within the
revenues then our revenue laws must
be readjusted. It Is as yet too early
to attempt to outline what shape such
a readjustment should take, for It is
as yet too early to say whether there
will be need for it. It should be con-
ldertd whether it is not desirable
that the tariff laws should provide for
applying as against or in favor of any
other nation maximum and minimum
tariff rates established by the con
gress, bo as to fecure a certain recl-
nrocitv of treatment between other
nations and ourselves. Having In
view even laiger considerations of pol
ler than those of a purely economic
nature, It wouM. In my judgment, be
well to endeavor to bring about cloa
er commercial connection? with the
other peoples of this continent.
am happy to be able to announce to
you that Russia now treats us on the
ti'.ost-favored-natlon basis.
Economy in Expenditures.
I earnestly recommend to congress
the need of economy and to this end
of a rlsli scrutiny of appropriations.
8 examples merely, 1 cm 11 your atten
tion to one or two specific matters.
All unnecessary offices should be abol
lhed. The commissioner of the gen
eral land office recommends the abol
lament of the office of receiver of
public moneys for t'nlted States land
offices. This will effect a saving of
about a quarter of a million dollars a
year. As the business of the nation
grows it is inevitable that there s..ould
be from time to time a legitimate In
crease in the number of officials, and
this fact renders It all the more im
Dortant that when offices become n
necessary they should be abolished, fn

unfair to say that many tens of thou
sands of volumes are published at
which no human being ever looks and
for which there Is no real demand
whatever.
Yet, In speaking of economy, 1 mut
In no wise be understood as advocat
Ing the false economy which Is In the
end the worst extravagance. To cut
down on the navy, for Instance, would
be a crime against the nation. To

Currency.
In my tnesage of December 2, 1902,
to the congress 1 said:
'intercut rates are a potent fac
tor In business activity, and In order
that the.e rates may he equallexd to
meet the varying needs of the 'canons
and of wldiy sjmrated communities
and to prevent the recurrence of finan
rial stringencies which Injuriously af
fect If'sltiroate business, It Is neces
sary that there should be an elemrnt
of elaoflritv in our monetary system.
Hanks are the natural servants of

and the issue of tLjs should be so

of itilg volume, which doe not re

soniw provision should be made that
will Insure a larger volume of money
during the full and winter months
than In the lo active seasons of the
year; so that the currency will con
tract against speculation, and wfll ex

netts. At present the treasury depart,

business world that Is, In the Inter

a remedy which should be provided by
congres'ional action.
Business Methods In Departments.
At various times I have instituted
Investigations Into the organlaztlon
and conduct of the buMness of the
executive department. While none of
thest InqulrUs hnve yet progressed
far enough to warrant final conclu
sions, they have already confirmed
nnd emphasized the general Impres
sion that the organlaztlon of the de
partments Is often faulty in principle
and waeteful In results, while many
of their business methods are ant!
qnnted and Inefficient. There is every
reason why our executive governmen
tal machinery should be at least as
well planned, economical, and efficient
as the best machinery of the great
business organizations, which at pre
sent Is not the case. To make It so
Is a task of complex detail and es
sentially executive In Its nature; pro
bnblv no legislative body, no mat
ter how wise and able, could under
take it with reasonable prospect of
success. I recommend that the con
gress consider this subject with a
view to provide by legislation for the
transfer, distribution, consolidation,
and assignment of duties ant execu
tive organizations or parts of organiza
tions, and for the changes in bu?lnes:i
methods, within or betwv'?n the seve
ral departments, that will bestpromate.

Federal Elections.
In my last annual message I raid:
"The -power of the government to
protect the Integrity of the elections
of its own officials is inherent, and
hss been recognized and affirmed by
repeated declarations of the Supreme
Court. There is no enemy of free
government more dangerous and none
so Insidious as the corruption of the
electorate. No one defends or excus
es corruption, and It would seem to
follow that none would oppose vigor
ous measures to eradicate It. I rec
ommend the enactment of a law di
rected against bribery and corruption '
in federal elections. The details of
such a law may be safely left to the
wise discretion of the consrress. Wat

stitution it Is possible to eo. aniT

t desire to repeat this recommenda
tion. In political campaigns In a coun
try as large and populous as ours It
is inevitable that there should be much
expense of an entirely legitimate Kind.
This, of course, means that many con-
tribution8, and some of them of largo
i size, must be made, and, as a matter
of fact,4 in any big political contest
such contributions are alwavs made to
both sides. It is entirely proper both
