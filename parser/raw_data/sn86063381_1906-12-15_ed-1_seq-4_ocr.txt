FEDERAL SUPREMACY
PRESIDENT WILL DISCUSS SUB-
JECT IN SPECIAL MESSAGE
TO CONGRESS.
METCALF'S REPORT FURNISHES KEY
JAPANESE QUESTION BASIS OF
DOCUMENT GIVING EXPRES-
SION OF VIEWS.
Chicago, Dec. 15.A dispatch to the
Record-Herald from Washington says:
A special message on the Japanese
question and the California school
problem, supplementary to the treat
ment of these same subjects by Pres
ident Roosevelt in his regular mes
sage last week, will be sent to con
gress from the White House next Tues
day. It is stated authoritatively that
this special message will be more vig
orous In tone than the former com
munication and will not be calculated
to cool the indignation of Californians,
previously aroused.
The special message, moreover,
aside from its local application, will
be one of the most notable and impor
tant communications in the entire list
of those sent to congress by the pres
ent executive. It will bring to a direct
issue the centralization scheme of gov
ernment which is likely to form the
climax of endeavor on the part of the
Roosevelt administration.
The administration is about to take
advanced ground regarding the doc
trine of federal supremacy over state
sovereignty. The Japanese question
raised in connection with the public
School system of California has sup
plied the opportunity to give forcible
expression to the mighty scheme of
centralization that is to be perfected
if possible.
Accompanies Metcalf's Report.
It is not possible at this writing to
forecast in detail what the president
will say in his second message on the
Japanese question. Accompanying his
message, which it is understood will
be a full explanation of the adminis
tration's projected policy as to the
supremacy of federal over state power,
will be the report of the special inves
tigation of the San Francisco school
question made by Secretary of Com
merce and Labor Metcalf. Regardless
of the nature of this report the presi
dent will adhere vigorously to the posi
tion taken by him in his regular mes
sage, which was written before he
left Washington to visit the canal
zone and before he had anything at all
from Secretary Metcalf.
But as to the Metcalf report it has
been learned that its author found
much to condemn in the matter of the
treatment of Japanese outside of the
school question. His report, in fact,
will furnish a new sensation. It will
show, it is understood, labor union
tyranny over Japanese which affects
ithe rights held to be theirs by treaty
in even more pronounced manner than
anything connected with the school
(imbroglio. i Matters of this nature embraced in
[Secretary Metcalf's report will furnish
Ithe key for many arguments to be ad
vanced by the president in his mes
sage.
DEATH TO SIMPLIFIED SPELLING.
President Consents to Withdraw Or
der to Public Printer.
Washington, Dec. 15.The house of
'representatives has declared in favor
of the old style of spelling and Pres
ident Roosevelt has consented to with
draw his order for the use of the
simplified spelling in all government
documents.
This action was taken as the result
of an interview Representative Landis
'Jiad with the president in which the
president said that if the house should
go on record against the new spelling
he would abandon his effort in that
direction. The house was prompt In
meeting this condition and the reso
lution was adopted by a unanimous
vote.
The system of reform spelling was
put into effect by the president during
the recess of congress, Aug. 27 last,
and all public documents supplied to
the executive departments have been
printed in the simplified way.

SHAW AT CURRENCY HEARING.
Says Bankers' Plan Is Inadequate to
Meet Requirements.
Washington, Dec. 15.Secretary
Shaw appeared before the house com
mittee on banking and currency in
advocacy of a high taxed credit cur
rency, suggesting 5 per cent as a de
sirable rate. He emphasized the need
for great elasticity in currency, but
expressed the opinion that the plan
framed by the American Bankers' as
sociation will not bring about sufficient
elasticity to be very useful. Granting
that the bankers' plan results in the
issuance of $200,000,000 additional in
national bank notes Mr. Shaw said
that in his opinion not more than
$20,000,000 worth of these will be re
deemed.
Mr. Shaw thought the bankers' plan
was wholly inadequate to meet the
requirements of the commercial world
and said it was encumbered with too
much machinery for the limited good
results he feels it is capable of accom
plishing. He said he did not want to
be regarded as an opponent of the
measure suggested by the bankers,
because he felt that any step toward
relieving the demand for greater elas
ticity at certain seasons of the year
was desirable, but he argued that the
committee strive to frame a more ef
fective measure.
It was. urged by the secretary that
an effort should be made to make all
our currency more elastic rather than
to impart elasticity to a certain
amount of emergency currency. Un
der the banker's plan, he said, only
the credit currency which goes into
national banks would be on its way to
redemption. There would be no rea
son why private banks should seek the
redemption of national bank notes and
consequently they would make no ef
fort to do so.
Washington, Dec. 15.No decision
as to the committee's attitude on ship
subsidy was reached at the caucus of
the Republican members of the house
committee on merchant marine and
fisheries held during the day. After
discussing the amended Gallinger bill
the Republicans took no action, but
decided to call a meeting of the com
mittee for Jan. 7, when a vote Of the
entire committee will be taken on the
measure.
The amendments to the bill, draft
ed by Representative Grosvenor, elim
inate cargo subsidy entirely and limit
the government's aid to mail carry
ing ships to South America and the
Orient. Even with these changes the
members of the committee from the
Middle West do not favor the meas
ure.
Later in the day it was stated that
President Roosevelt will send to con
gress a special message advocating
the passage of a ship subsidy measure
at the present session. It was said
that the president had declared that
the recommendation in his annual
message was misunderstood. In that
message he said that if it were found
inexpedient to pass the senate bill a
measure should be passed to provide
for a few lines to South American
ports. He did not mean to minimize
the importance of other features of the
bill, it is said, and now purposes to
correct any false impression that may
have been gained by the house.
PATRICK SEEKS FREEDOM.
Relatives, However, Will Ask Com
mutation of Sentence.
New York, Dec. 15.With the with
drawal of the application for a writ
of error in the United States supreme
court the legal fight to save Albert T.
Patrick came to an end after the hard
est fought battle in the criminal rec
ords of the country.
It now remains to apply to Governor
Higglns for a commutation of sen
tence to life imprisonment. In spite
of the determination of Patrick him
self to accept nothing save a pardon,
announced only a few days ago by
himself from his cell in Sing Sing
prison, such an application, designed
merely to save his life, it is stated,
will be made within a few days.
Mrs. Patrick and Patrick's sister,
Mrs. Milliken of St. Louis, will be the
petitioners as the nearest relatives of
the. condemned man. Governor Hig
gins has not publicly Indicated that he
would even now save-Patrick from the
electric chair, but^such is the expecta
tion of Patrick's wife and of his attor
neys.

Washington, Dec. 15.Represents^
Vive Littauer of New York offered the
following amendment to the legisla
tive, executive and judicial appropria
tion bill under consideration in the
house
"On and after March 4, 1907, the
compensation of the speaker of the
house of representatives and vice pres
ident of the United States shall be at
the rate of $12,000 each."
Mr. Littauer spoke in favor of the
amendment. By a vote of 214 to 51
the amendment was adopted, the op
position failing to secure votes enough
to have the yeas and nays called.
Representative Littauer also* intro
duced an amendment to the legislative
appropriation bill increasing the sal
aries of the members of the pres
ident's cabinet to $12,000 each, effec
tive on and after March 4, 1907.
On division the amendment was
adopted, 204 to 60, the opponents of
the measure failing again to secure
votes enough to have the yeas and
nays called.
Representative Littauer also of
fered an amendment increasing the
salaries of senators, representatives
in congress and delegates from terri
tories to $7,500 per annum, "which
compensation shall be in lieu of all
other pay and allowance except actual
Individual traveling expenses from
their homes to the seat of government
and return by the most direct route of
usual travel once for each session of
the house to which such senator, mem
ber or delegate belongs, to be certified
to under his hand to the disbursing
officer and filed as a voucher." The
real test and temper of the house was
taken on this amendment, when a yea
and nay vote was called.
On a rising vote the amendment
was defeated by a vote of 136 to 161.
COMPULSORY ARBITRATION.
House Committee Considers Represen
tative Townsend's Bill.
Washington, Dec.. 15.Representa-
tive Townsend's bill for the compul
sory investigation of troubles between
employers and employes which affect
the transportation of government
mails or the necessary movement of
interstate and foreign commerce was
under consideration during the day by
the house committee on interstate and
foreign commerce, which has begun its
hearings on the measure.
Charles P. Neil, United States com
missioner of labor, appeared before
the committee and heartily supported
the Townsend bill, saying he believed
it would bring many labor disputes to
a satisfactory end.
In explanation of his bill Mr. Towns
end said that the arbitration of the
anthracite coal strike in 1902 by a
commission'showed the desirability of
such a method of bringing labor trou
bles to an end.
"Some labor leaders," he said, "may
desire to settle their differences with
out interference and many employers
may have the same desire, but," he
added, "this selfish view does not take
the welfare of the public into consid
eration."
Mr. Townsend's bill provides that
there shall be interference only where
the president Is convinced that inter
ference is necessary, Investigations
are to be made by a commission of
seven men, two of whom shall be
familiar with labor's claims and two
with the claims of .employers, while
three are to be wholly disinterested.
GENERAL SERVICE PENSIONS.
Senator McCumber Will Push Meas
ure in Senate.
Washington, Dec. 15.Senator Mc
Cumber, chairman of the committee
on pensions, is planning to press for
early consideration by the senate the
house general service pension bill as
amended by the senate committee.
The amendments provide that any sol
dier of the Civil war, who has served
for ninety days, has been honorably,
discharged and who shall have
reached the age of ,'sixty-two years,
shall receive a pension of $12 a month,
to be increased to $15 a month when
he shall have reached the age of sev
enty years and to $20 a month after
he has reached the age of seventy-five
years. It is estimated that an addi
tional appropriation of $10,714,400 an
nually would be required to pay the
increased rate provided by the bill to
the soldiers now on the pension roll.

LIFESAVER8 RESCUE CREW.
Austrian Steamer Ashore Off the New
Jersey Coast. I
New York, Dec. 15.While bound
from Trieste, Austria, by the way of
Bermuda, to New York, the Austrian]
freight steamer Clara went ashore'
near the Mantoloking lifesaving sta-j
tion at the head of Barnegat bay, on
the Jersey coast. The action of the
sea quickly threw the Clara broadside
to the beach, where she lay easily in
the sand. The Mantoloking lifesavers
went to the rescue of the crew of the
Btranded craft. A line was shot over
the ship and a breeches buoy hauled
off all on board the Clara. The cap
tain of the Clara came ashore in the
buoy and sent word to New ,York for
assistance and in response a wrecking
tug was dispatched from this city to
pull the steamer off the beach.
The Clara has a cargo consisting
principally of dried fruits, hides, iron
ore and, 250 tons of brimstone. The
value of the vessel and her cargo is
between $500,000 and $600,000.

DOUBTED BY THE PEOPLE
CAREFULLY PREPARED BULLE-
TIN OF KING OSCAR'S CON-
DITION ISSUED.
Stockholm, Dec. 15.King Oscar's
condition shows considerable improve
ment. Towards noon the following^
guarded official bulletin "vyas Issued:
"King Oscar passed a quiet night.
He slept six hours, only coughed a'
little a?id his temperature in the morn
ing was 100,9. His pulse is still irreg-!
ular, but there is.no increase of phlegm
in the lungs. The patient's. general
condition is fairly satisfactory."
The official bulletin had the effect of
reassuring the people, but the hope-!
fulness it contained was somewhat'
shaken when it leaked out in the I
course Of the afternoon that camphor
and digitalis had been freely used in
the treatment of the patient. The
impression is gaining ground that the
king's condition is much more serious
than represented by the bulletin.
Crown Prince Qustaf arrived, here
during the day from Berlin and as
sumed the regency, which he will hold
during his father's illness.
You may depend upon it that he is a

8UPPRESS DIVORCE DETAILS.
Pittsburg Chamber of Commerce Asks
Sf:SX-..^ Courts to Act.
^Pittsburg, Dec 15/After much dis
cussion, in which some members were,
horror stricken by the freedom of the
debate, the Pittsburg chamber of com
merce passed a resolution calling on
judges of county courts to suppress
all facts and details of immoral cases
and demanding that newspapers of
Pittsburg cease, printing divorce court
news. This action is the direct result
of the Hartje divorce case.
"Every line of testimony given at
the recent divorce court trial relating
to statutory offenses was passed upon
by the mixed classes at the high
school," declared G. W. Hacklin.
S. W. Black, millionaire real estate
broker, opposed the resolution. "Some
of you," he said, "will be wanting next
to suppress the Bible. It contains
more indecent stories than the news
papers, but it is not so generally read
among members of this body."

FRENCH CABINET DECIDES ON
NEW MEANS TO ENFORCE
CHURCH LAWS.
MHEDIATE CONFISCATION PROPOSED
STEPS TO BE TAKEN BY GOVERN-
MENT OF A MOST SWEEPING
CHARACTER.
Paris, Dec 15.The cabinet met
during the day with President Pal
lieres in the chair in order to decide
upon the new legislation to be pre
sented to parliament. The steps to be
taken are of a very sweeping charac
ter. It is proposed to amend the law
of 1905 providing for the separation of
church and -state, but on which a year's
grace was allowed before the per
manent alienation of the church prop
erty, and to suppress the privilege of
forming new cultural or diocesan as
sociations during that period, and all
church property, including the sem
inaries, will be immediately handed
over to the state, to the departments
and to the communes under conditions
Insuring that the churches themselves
will be retained for religious uses.
The continuance of public worship will
be provided for under a combination
of the laws of 1881 and 1901. With
regard to the' pensions and allow
ances of the clergy distinctions will
be made by which those who are en
titled to the former will lose their
rights if they are deprived of their
French citizenship, while those who
are entitled to the latter will lose
.-their allowances if they do not con
form with the law. The conditions
under which the clergy will forfeit
their French citizenship will be drawn
up in a special measure to be pre
pared
