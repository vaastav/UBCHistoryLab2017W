T.iriWDAT MORNING, IWttbcr 16th. 1*75.
CojrnßtaE.—The proceedings of Con
gress since Its present meeting have
been without special interest, the lower
branch not haring yet gotten into
working condition. It is expected,
however, that tbe different committees
will be constituted by the Speaker in
a few days, but nothing iu way of earn
est, serious business is likely to be
brungbt up until after the coming
Christmas Holidays. Tbe majority
appear to be bent upon reform and re
trenchment investigations, and in this
connection, very many interesti g de
velopments may be expected. In tbe
Senate, the Republicans hare com menced
business by giving an unfair organiza
tion to some of the committees, par
ticularly to that on Finance. This is
likely and certainly ought to lead to
retaliation on tbe part of tbe lower
4House. The more bitterly the
parties iu Congress are antagonized the
the greater tbe likelihood of a thorough
and searching investigation into all
matters of corruption and misgovern
meat.
Caimihat. Mattsks.—Win. 11. Skin
ner, colored, was brought l*efore Jus
tice Morgan on Friday last charged with
the larceny of one yearling, the proper
ty of Dominick S. Bowles, and after an
examination of the case was held to
■ wait the action of the Grand Jury.—
The Larceny was one of very daring per
j < tration, and the arrest of the party
waa'tnet by considerable resistance. In
an attempt to escape, Skinner was shot
in the shoulderand face l-y Mr. Bowles.
His wounds have been attended to and
wore pronounced not to be of a serious
character. The accused failing to pro
cure bail was committed to the custody
of the Sheriff and is now confined in
jail. Col. Crane appeared for the State
and Messrs. Harris and Camalier for
the accused.
Henry Simpson, colored, was also on
the same day brought before Justice
Hammett, charged with breaking into
the store .f Parsons Si Spalding, situa
ted in the Patuxent district. The tes
timony not being sufficient to commit,
the attused was discharged. He was
iuuuediab !v ro-amated upon a peace
warrant, and failing to procure bail, was
committed to jail. C’ol. Crane appear
ed for State and B. U, Camalier fur the
acciucd.
• A Nr.w PeesidentialCanpidate.—
I ndcr the caption above given, wc no
tice that our Washington city cotem
poraries describe in late issues the ar
rest and temporary sequestration of “a
demented individual, calling himself
A Bailey, and hailing from Leonard
town, who imagine s himself the coming
president.” Ihe arrest, it seems, was
made by < fficer Henkle. (no relation,
by-the-by, of our eloquent representa
tive in Congress.) ami was perfected
whilst the aforesaid “coming president”
was “haranguing a crowd of urchins on
Louisiana Avenue.” The writers go
oa to state, that the Bailey aforesaid
was subsequently taken to police Head
quarters and threatened, among other
things, with the insane asylum. All
we have to say in reference to the
above matter is. that a Bailey might
have been arrested and treated as sta
ted. but we demand, does it therefore
follow that a Bailey and (Jen. Austin
Bailey of our Town is one and the
same person r The General is, indeed,
a candidate for the presidency and
“hails” from Leonardtown, but that
he can be the person s|>cken of or that
any 11 mile ever arrested him is a story
just a lit* !e too preposterous, gentlemen,
to impose on ws, however it may have
tffocttd the weak intellect of others.
A Mossier Hoo. — Many of our co
temporaries in tbe upper } art of the
State have l*e n indulging in huge brags
this Fall al out the weight of the pet
bogs of their section, the heaviest that
wo noted being 575 !hs. We thought
all the time that St. Mary's could beat
this if she ma lo an . ffort. and we
have now to record, that James F.
Abell, Esqr., killed a porker at his
place on the 13th instant whose nett
weight amounted to 6081 ths. The hog
in question was pigged the last of Sep
tember To and was consequently aged
•bout 2(11 months at the date of killing.
Mr. Al-ell estimated that the hog
gained -Li) Bs within the last twelve
mouths. Stock Chester.

Tes Pbesidcvt's Mbssaob.—Tbe
only thing in the President’s Message
which seems to have arrested special
public attention is bis preposition to
amend tbe Constitution by the adoption
of a provision requiring the several
States to establish and forever maintain
free public schools adequate to, at least,
the rudimentary education of all children
irrespective or color, sex nationality or
religion; forbidding, however, tbe teach
ing in such schools or inculcation of pagan
or atheistic tenets, or the bestowal of
school funds to any religions denomi
nation for educational purposes. He
also objects to tbe accumulation of vast
amounts of untaxed church property,
and says that class of property in the
•United States in 1875 amounts to sl,.
000,000,000. He recommends the tax
ation of all such property, exempting
only cemeteries and limited edifices for
churches. Beyond these suggestions,
the Message is quite as flat as public
Messages generally are, the present
one, however showing evidence of care
and ability in preparation.
Pbizb Stobixs.—The proprietors of
The Weekly Sun announce a liberal of

tbe best story will be given a prize of
five hundred dollars; for the second,
two hundred and seventy-five dollars;
for tbe third, two hundred dollars; for
the fourth, one hundred dollars; for
the fifth, seventy-five dollars, and for
the sixth fifty dollars. The award will
be announced soon after the first of
March, and the publication of tbe prize
stories commenced at once thereafter.
The following conditions must be ob
served by conj}<ctitors for these prizes.
1. All the stories are to be American
in their scenes, subjects and character,
in whole or in part; that is to say, the
basis of the story must be American,
but this condition does not preclude
such incidental diversion from Ameri
can scenes, subjects and character as
may be necessary to interesting devel
opment of the story.
2. The stories must not contain sen
timents of a political, sectarian or sec
tional nature, it being especially requir
ed that allusions to the late sectional
war be avoided; and they must he of
such tone as befitsthe character of such
an extensively circulated Family Jour

[OoMMCNICATEP.
Leona kotows, Dec. 13, 1875.
Editor/: —I tender you my
sincere thanks for publishing in the
Beacon my circular to the Democratic
members of the House of Representa
tives, and especially for your commen
dation and wishes for my success as
candidate for the office of Sergeant-at-
Arms. My thanks are also due for
similar notice taken of my application
to the Montgomery Sentinel , the Nw
nan (Ga.) Herald and New Yoik Day
Root, and probably to other thorough
democratic journals. As a set-off to
their favorable consideration, I have
l>een assailed by other papers profess
ing democratic principles, not only for
the oj inions and wishes expressed in
my circular, but *he most unbecoming
and offensive epithets have been applied
to me personally—“ ironclad Bourbon,”
“unrepentant rebel.”“lunatic” and even
“fool,” are specimens of their notice of
me.
To tic first charge, in the proper ap
plicaiion of it, 1 plead guilty. The
charge of being a Bourbon indicates, no
doubt, reproach by those who male it.
for not forgetting the chief duty and
obligation of an American citizen to re
collect and support the Constitution of
bis country. That instrument should
lo held sacred by him as the great
foundation stone of his liberty and his
earthly happiness. It should* never be
changed by custom or force, but onlv
by the mode provided within itself—the
full consent of three-fourths of the
'States —any other mode of change be
ing utterly null and void. On these
points the American patriot should be
invincibly ••ironclad” and “hold the
fort.”
But what offeuce* have I committed
to justify the other epithets or charges
made against me ? Even many of rov
friends who were anxious for my suc
cess were somewhat stocked in’ what
they called my rashness iu making the
developments contained in my circular,
and considered mv prospects complete
ly marred for that reason. Inthistbev
did not take counsel from tbeir own
honest hearts and judgments, but from
the sneaking character of politics and
politicians. A man who seeks office in
these degenerate day* must not be too
frank He should learn to suppress
the truth, and if necessary for success!
not hesitate t practice false pretences.!
These very fashionable tricks do ant ac
cord with my ideas of what is proper. \
Tbe fact is, Messrs. Editors, I tin 1
neither afraid nor ashamed of havingm v
record presented to public view, for I
sincerely believe it is based upon tbe
true theory of our government. No of
fice that can be offered me would cause
me to retract one single position taken
in my circular and I feel highly compli
mooted that even thirteen members of
the House did not consider its ooolents
any objection to voting for me. Not
having soughtany-pledges from any one
I do not know who the thirteen were,
but whenever known I am confident
they will be found to be thorough dem
ocn is.®
Tbe points taken in that circular are :
Ist. That I voted fur John C. Bretk
enridge in 1860, standing on his con
st itutiocal platform. That needs no
defense. 2nd. That I would not vote
for Horace Greeley in 1972, standing
' on bis unconstitutional, negro equality
platform. I have received too many
| compliments for my cou-se in that re
spect to require one word in defense,
and truly hope that suicidal dose will
not again be taken by tbs democratic
party. 3rd. I expressed my belief in
tbe fight of Slate secession. Some of
the greatest men in this
lieved in the right and publicly assert
ed and taught it. Eveu the Govern
ment of the United States bad it taught
in the only school under its control
(West Point) by placing in tbs hands
of Jefferson Davis and other pupils as
a text-book Rawle’s Commentaries on
tbe Constitution, in which it is express
ly and ably taught. A singular in
s’ ructor truly, who punished its pupils for
learning tbe lessons assigned to them.
It is true, the late war killed and crip
pled a million of men, and with them
killed the late act of secession, hut it
did not and cannot kill the principle.
That will awaken again whenever one
section of States, with tbe Government
to back if, shall dare to trample on tbe
rigtys of another section, as was done
by the North upon tbe South. If such
a case should occur within the short
remnant of my life (which God forbid)
I shall certainly approve secession as 1
did in the case of the South. It must
indeed l>e an extraordinary exercise of
oppression for which it would ever 1 e
adopted, for all the States know ai d
feel the • great benefits of the Un
ion when the Government performs its
constitutional duties, instead of tram
pling upon and rendering insecure the
constitutional rights of the States. The
prominent men of the North—the men
who had control of the Government in
Itf'Jl—did not disguise that their ob
ject, in forming the Republican party,
was to bring about such a condition of
affairs, which the South knew and fell
and st ill fed would he and is most op
pressive ami destructive of their inter
est and happiness. Without enlarging
on this point and repeating that I hope
no cause for secession will ever again
arise. I stand by the declaration that
the South was right in every point of
view in seceding from the Union, and
that the war carried on against her for
so doing was a useless and atrocious
outrage. There never was an occasion
in which the words of the dramatist oc
curred with more force to the unselfish
patriot and statesman —“Take away the
sword. States can be saved without it.”
That my denunciation of tbe war as
an outrage should bring on an attack
from a democratic paper or democratic
man displays considerable inconsisten
cy and injustice. I opposed it, it is
true, from the beginning, while many
of them aided by tbeir v< tea and servi
ces in carrying it on. But sometime
about the 2i*th of August, 1864, the
Chicago democratic platform brought
us vorv near together, when it was de
clared in tiial Convention, iu their sec
ond resolution, that ‘‘Justice, humani
ty, liberty and the public welfare de
manded that immediate efforts l*e made
for a cessation of hostilities.” Why.
gentlemen, in view of these facts assail
with abuse so humble au individual as j
T am ?
After stamping the war an an afro
cions outrage, it was quite logical that
I should not desire success for the in
vaders in such a war. With these feel
imrs. I ottered the prayer, not that the
S<.uth should injure or subjugate the
North, hut oh shocking! 1 prayed that
the North might not subjugate the
South. In view of the awful calamities
which have followed the overt brow of the
South and the insolent tyranny of the
North. I do not believe that there is a
single intelligent patriot in the land
who doss not regret that God did not
grant my prayer. But inde|>endentlv
of consequences, whaS propriety is there
in condemning me for uttering this
prayer when the Lower House of Con
gress (1 think unanimously) declared,
in the celebrated Crittenden resolution,
“That this war is not waged upon our
part in any spirit of oppression nor for
any purpose of eonqnrst or nbjngaUon.'*
If such a prayer as I offered had been
made by any member of that House
which passed that resolution, would they
have attempted to erptl or ct new re him?
I jadue not. WLy did they not censure
Mr. Crittenden who offered it ? It adds
strength to my position when we find
that a motion was made iw the Senate
when the Crittenden resolution reached
that body, by Senate r Trumbull, to
strike out the word “subjugation,”
which was rejected by the vote of eve
ry Senator present but Trumbull, thus
rebuking him for expressing the desire
to thhjtigoU the South. Thus, it ap
pears, the Senate and *he House both
denounced the idea of subjugation. I
afterwards prayed that they might not
do what they considered a deliberate
wrong, and while they are held up as
great patriots and statesmen. I am
|>ointed at as an unrej'entant rebel by
Republicans and a lunatic and fool by
Democrats, beeanse with such a record
as above 1 had the audacity to offer
myself as a candidate foran office with
in the gift of the present Democratic
House of Representatives,
I will sav no more at present. I hope
ray friends will be satisfied with this
defense, and I trust that those who
have spoken so harshly of me may feel
that they have done me injustice.

EFFECTS OF INTEMPERANCE.
Who that baa pawed through St.
Mary’s County, baa not noticed! the
number of empty whiskey barrels piled
around the storedoors, to aay nothing
of the quantity which have been sold
or disj>osed of in various ways ? . The
questions arise what becomes of all this
whiskey and other drinks which have
left these empty casks so numerous?
Where dees all the money come from
to pay for it ? Coatlftg as it does from
550 to 5150 a I artel ? These are ques
tions tf momentous interest to the
lople of our county, temperate as well
as intemperate. I am under the im
pression, that the amount of money
spent in tits one article, would feed,
clothe, and educate every indigent child
iu the county, and buy a very docent
farm for their parents in five year’s
time. Is not this something to think
about? Look around your neighbor
hood, and see some of* the evil conse
quences, produced by this immense
trafic—wives with no decent clothes and
not even the common comforts or even
necessities of life, children naked and
can’t be emtio eckool, but stay at home and
and grow up in ignorance, with no bet
ter example aet before them than the
curses and drunken deportment of their
father, who baa forgotten the manhood
to which be baa been raised; the mother
often slunk away in the corner worn
ont and broken down by the brutal man
ner in which she has been treated for
years, and who was probably once the
pride of a family, and now you find her
eking out a life of toil and misery too
intolerable to think of, and not much
less to relate. I asked a man some
days ago why be did not send his cbil
dren to school, (bright intelligent chil
dren apt to learn) the answer was “I
haint got any clothes for them;” the
same answer I have received from many
of a similar nature. The very children
that arc in need of education, and uj-on
whom an education would do most good
for the rising genet rat ion, are kept at
home, because they can’t get clothes,
when the price paid for one gallon of
whisker would probably buy a suit of
clothes. It is for the benefit of these
very children, that the State of Mary
land provides the means of education,
and yet tk> y cannot he sent to achoid be
cause they have no clothes. Is the State
to furnish the clothes too;’ I answer if
it </(dit would henouet.bebetterfor it; for
the children would not be sent even upon
this condition, unless forced by some
arbitrary power on the part of the Stale.
Is it possible that man lets lost all bis
sense of duty to God and his country,
in thnsthrowing himself below the brute
creation, and depriving bis offspring
of the leneficent consideration of the
State in providing the means of rais
ing his children to the top step of the
ladder which has Wen placed within
reach of every child to climb at Lis
leisure.? I had a class before me a few
days ago writing the definition of words:
among them was,“deplorable.” I asked
them to write the name of the most
deplorable evil in this county, and every
ent of them wrote—“ Whiskey,” which
shows very distinctly that the very
children are aware of the baneful effe' ts
of intemperance. A truer saying never
entered or proceeded from man than
this, “Intemperance destroys its vota
ries.” And also might be classed with
it, “Idleness and ignorance are the pa
rents of many victs.” For all proceed
from internjrance.
The industrious and temperate man
is always prosperous, bis wife is happy,
children well clothed and educated,
while the indolent and intemperate
man is poor and miserable, Lis wife
worn out and dejected, children naked
and umducated and everything around
him marks out the path of degradation
and ruin. What a prosperous country
this would be if the money thus sj-ent
could be applied to the mural training
of our youth, who are one day to rule
this to be hoped for “Glorious Uu
ion.”

Metre*. Editor*: —Please allow me a
small space in your paper, for the pur
pose of making a few remarks, aed
asking a few questions of my fellow
teachers of the public schools of St.
Marv’s County. Teachers and the pub
lic genctally concede that teachers’ as
sociations are a benefit to teachers, pu
pils, jialmns and the public,—associa
tions in which teachers meet for the
purpose of interchanging views ujon
the methods of teaching and aubjects of
instruction. No teacher of common
sense will but admit that there ia a
great advantage to be gained by attend
ing these associations. If to, why,
I ask of the teachers, is it that our as
sociations are so sparsely attended ?
Is it because we have undergone a
searching examination and received
certificates of qualification, and thereby
are content to rest ujon our laurels ?
If so, better, far better, I would say,
ha-hit l>een that we received ho certifi
cates at all, or our attendance upon the
associations hsd l-een made imperative
and a part of our qualification. Have
wc lost interest iu public education ?
If so. why ? Do we think that our
teaching capacity is good enough ?
Have we such a conceit of ourselves
as to believe we should know no more
than what we are to impart to o*ir pu
pils ? Can we improve ourselves by meet
ing in common council? These are 1
questions which I ask my fellow-tach
ere to consider well and answer.
We have formed associations, and
we should adhere to the rule*; we should (
keep up a progressive movement and
not a retrogressive one. Our Divine
Lord baa said, “A hoove divided against
itself cannot stand.” It is equally true
of our associations. By keeping* aloof
from tbs associations, members of the
structure gradually become weaker and
weaker, until at length it must topple
and fall.
Fellow.teachers, you see the cor.se
qnencra. Shall it be as I have des
cribed or shall it be otherwise ? Shall
we act in isolation, and depend upon
our own resources, or shall we make
a common stock of our knowledge
and experience and assist each other
in tbe discharge of oar important
tie*—The education f the ruing gw
•ration ?
We hate made several attempts to
Mtablish teachers’ Associations,” and
la my opinion have naif martially
•neeeeded. Whether the taifhrea are
to be attributed to a want of apprecia
tion of such enterprise on oar part, or the
lack of proper encouragement. I will not
attempt to discuss. That we hare only
partially succeeded, is evidence, bow*,
ever, of the absence of interest* from
some cause or other. Our system of
public instruction will never become as
efficient as was intended, until we make
a common stock of tbe knowledge awl
experiem-e we posses*. How can we
,dosoif we absent ourselves from tbe
meetings of the associations? Have
we forgotten the encouraging words of
our worthy Professor daring tbe “In
stitute ?” He said “be saw great im
provement on the part of tbe teachers,
, and be attributed the improvement to
tbe teachers’ associations.” Now, fel
' low-teschers, let us stand firm and keep
