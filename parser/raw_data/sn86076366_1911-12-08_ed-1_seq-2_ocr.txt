DISTRICT COURT
Court met at 3 o'clock with
Judge Taber on the bench. The
roll of grand jurors was railed
and all answered to their names.
Judge Taber suhrcitted the
gambling cases to the erand jury
and in doing so told its members
that he had received reliable in
formation that some of them had
been approached by parties with
the intent of influencing their
action. He unmercifully roasted
the men who would attempt to
influence grand jurors and ex
pressed the fullest confidence in
each and every member of the
jury.
At the concluhion of the Judge's
remarks, the jury retired to con
sider the gambling cases and such
other matters as might come be
fore them.
Court conveneud at 5:30 o'clock
Saturday afternoon to receive the
report of the grand jury which
will be found elsewher".
Judge Taber received the report
and excused the grand jury sub
ject to call.
Seperate indictments were re
turned aganst Jack Maher and Ah
fim and a joint indictment against
M. B. Johnson and George
Horagor. The indictment against
Ah Sin* was ignored.
The court set S o'clock, p. m. as
the time for arraignment. At
that hour th?- defendants were
arraigned and given until Tuesday
at 10 o'clock to plead.
FISHERMAN'S LUCK
The lady bather had got into a
hole, and she couldn't swim. Nor
could the young man on the end of
the pier; but when she carne up
for the first time and he caught
sight of her face he shrieked:
"Help!"
A burly fisherman sauntered to
his side.
"Wot'e up" he hoarsely cried
"My wife! Drowning! I can't
swim! Twenty pounrJs for you if
you save hei !"
In a moment the fisherman was
in the sea. In another moment he
was out of it, with the rescued
lady bather. Swelling with ex
pectation, he approached the
young man again. "Well, what
about that twenty quid?" he asked.
But if the young man's f tee had
been ashen before, it was now
deadly pale as he gazed upon the
features of the recovering dame.
"Y-e-s 1 know; he gasped. "But
when I trade' the ofTer 1 thought
it was my wife who was drowning,
and now it turns out it was my
wife's mother"
The fisherman pulled a long
fsce.
"Just my luck! he muttored
thrusting has liand into his
trousers pocket. "How much do
I owe you?" ? Tit Hits.
HOUSEHOLD HINTS
Crnmpled newspapers pushed up
the flues of unused chimneys keep
out flies that would enter there.
To remove potato, onion and
other vegerta! le stains from the
hands, rub with ripe tomatoes.
Rave all your cof Tee grounds;
rinse them and use them to stuff
pincushions They will hold shape
indeflnity and the pins push in
easily. ,
If a tablespoonfuil of swret
milk is added to each yolk of egtr i
when making custards, the <
mixture will not curdle when i
added to the boihig milk. i
By inspecting the canned fruit
occasionally, the housewife will be
able to save any that has begun to
spoil, by carefully removing that
which is tainted and conking the
rest over, recanning it as in the
start.
Use worn-out white stockings
for wash rags. Cut away the
foot. Fold the top double and
hem or overcast the edges. TI.e
edges may be bound, and a strip
fastened across the center to slip
the hand through.
7o cook eggplant, cut into slices
half an inch thick and let them lie
for an hour in salted water to
remove that bitter taste. To fry,
put the slices in the frying-pan
with a small quantity of butter:
turn when one side is done.
Have you tried taking eggs?
Grease a baking-dish with
butter, break the eggs into it,
cover with crcam. Add salt,
pepper, and a table^poonful of
butter. Set it in a moderate oven
a few minutes. Le.igth of time
depends on whether you like them
soft or well-done. ? Farm Journal.
THE GOLGONOTCATTLE
COMPANY MUST ANSWER !
A Larson dispatch uf the 6th to
the Reno Gazette says:
The arraignment of the Gol
conda Cattle company, charged
with illegal fencing of government
land, amounting to 30,000 acres
in Humboldt and Elko counties
of this state, occurred in the
federal court in this city yesterday
afternoon, and the attorneys for
the company entered a plea of not
guilty to the criminal charge.
Then on motion of U. S. District
AttoreySam Piatt, the cas" was .set
for trial for January 8, lull. The
two civil suits brought by the
government against the Golconda
Cattle company will be called up
later. One is fr>r the abatement
of tiie enclosure surrounding the
land and the other for damages
amounting to $15,000.
The Golconda Cattle company
is represented by Attorneys
William Dei. man of San Francisco,
U'Ren of Washington. D. C.. and
Chas. Lewers of Reno The gov
ernment is represented by Sain
I'latt, the U. S. district attorney
for the district of Nevada.
It is aleged by the government
that the Golcjnda Cattle company,
of which Congressman Willam H.
Kent of California is president,
has enclosed ever 30,000 acres of
govrenment land in Humbodlt and
Elko countif s, by purchasing the
l.tnd surrounding the land in
question and when fencing this,
thus gaining possession of the 30,
000 acres without actually fencing
it in.
In one civil tnit the government
asks the court to order the com
pany to remove the fence and in
the other suit the government asks
that the company pay the govern
ment $ 1 5,000 as damages due the
government a* the result of the
fencing of t his land.
The case is one of considerable
importance and involves some very
wealthy men. If the government
wins the.se suits and convicts the
company under the indictment it
will result in the company being
fined and in the throwing open of
much land now controlled by this
company.
DISTRICT COURT
On th? convening of the dis
trict court this forenoon .Indue
Taber, set the cases nf Ah Jim
and Johnson and Foragor for trial
at 10 o'clock next Monday, Decem
ber 11th.
The trial of Dan Harry on th e
charge of forgery was then pro
ceedcd with. At 2 o'clock this
nfternoon, the jury was excluded
from the court room while the
defense m oved the court to direct
the jury to find n verdict of not
guilty on the ground that the checks
in evidence were not forgeries.
The argument on t he motion was
in progress when our report closed.
A Washington dispatch says
that when the postoflie department
opened the bids for a star mail
service between Jarbidgo and
Deeth the only bid was for $12,000
a year, and it was deemed ex
cessive. The department has since
modified the terms of the proposed
rontraet and scope of the service,
n the hope of securing a reason- i
ihlc bid. i
PROPOSED CHURCH AND 1
Y. M. C. A. BUILDING I
About a year ag" Prof. Mc-|
Whinney supe rintender.t of the
Presby terian Sunday .-chool called
the workers of that school to
gether and after a careful state
ment of the conditions and needs
of the school said: "We must
have more room and better equp
ment." This was the begining of
the movement that is now being
made for the building of a new
Presbyterian church with quarters
adapted to the work of the Young
Mens Christian Association.
A little later an effort was made
to inaugurate a Y. M. C. A.
Many of our citizens wen- inter
ested in both the movements and
the difficulty of building and
maintaining the Y. M. C. A. as a
seperate institution has brought
the two organizations together
into a combined effort for the
benefit of both.
The new building will be placed
on the corner of Sixth and Idaho
streets, facing the Highschool. It
will be of concrete blocks in
Colonial style harmonizing with
our beautiful Court house. It will
occupy a frontage of 07 feet on
Idaho street. The lower portion
will he built with a basement thai
will be one-third '>r more above
the ground, thus giving ample
light and ventilation. On Sixth
street near Idaho will be the main
entrance into the lower part. En
tering through a large vestibule
and turning to the left one will
enter into a room 1 "J by 30 well
lighted and adapted for use as a
reading room. Communicating
with this room will be one 35 by
41 for use as a gymnasium. To
the rear of these rooms will be a
large dining hall and kitchen. In
the nothwest corner of the build
ing is a room 10 by 15 that will be
used for a game room.
In add:tion to these rooms in the
main building there will be a
sep rate pool and probably a hand
ball court and other athletic
apparatus. For the purpose of
this building lot 9 has just been
purchased, making the available
ground for the two buildings 100
feet square.
The upper floor will be divided
into two portions. The front with
entrance on Idaho street will be
for church serviced and will
conta.n a study, choir room, and
room suitable for prayer or social
servi vs or committee meetings, as
well as an auditorium with a seat
ing capacity double that of the]
present room. In the rear part
with an entrance on Sixth street!
will be the Sunday school room |
with seperate quarters for the
primary department and a dozen J
largo class rooms and yet so]
arranged thai l?y moving a screen j
and n platform it can be made a!
part of the main aduitorium with n;
seating capacity of over 500.
During the past week the work'
of soliciting lias he en carried on
rather slowly because of the
necessity of explaining to many the
details as here Kiven. Committees
have heen organized in I.amoilej
and South Fork and are ennvassinj?
those valleys As rapidly as our
leading citizens are becoming
acquainted with the plar.s they are
approving this eTorts for thej
betterment of the social condition
of our your-K people.
A effort is being made to secure
the presence of a Y. M. C. A.'
represetative to look after the
nterests of that organization. The
plan ns proposed is to organize a
Y. M. C. A. and to lease to them
at a nominal rent nil portions of
?he huliding that can be used by
the organization. This places the
management of reading room, pool
und so forth in the hands of this
organization controlled by its own
members anil seperate and di tinct
from the church organization.
Under this plan one can be a
member of either or of both
scoicties. The Y. M. C. A. being
relieved of having to raise a large
rent will be able to make its fees
reasonable, put a good man in as
| secretary and push the work in
Elko giving great advan &ge?- to
the young men and women who
| come from the various parts of
the county to attend our un
excelled high school.
TAFT'S FQHCOMING MESSAGE
I I
Washington dispatches say that
President Taft's message on the
reconvening of congress in De
cember will be devoted to the mat
ter of the trusts alone.
That this is an important topic
can not be denied, but whether it
is foremost in the interest of the
people may be doubted. That
place has long been and still is
occupied by the question of tar i tT
reduction.
Trusts ha*, e been arraigned
before the si'preme court, found
guilty and ordered to be dissolved
and reorganized. The old order
of competition has not been res
tored, neither has the price of
trust products been lowerd.
The Sherman anti-trust law
may, therefore, be properly
deemed to be in need of aid and
reinfor cement.
Hut somenow the people can not
be rid of the idea that trie high
protective tariff is what has bred
the trusts and nourished them into
their present great stature and
strength.
"I am putting all my eggs into
ore backet," *aid i'ic*<Ur.t Tuft
in commenting on the fact that
his forthcoming message is to
concern the trust exclusively. The
president, as usual, puts his eggs
into the wrong basket. It is true
that he will have a message on the
taritl later when his tariff board
reports, but it is this precious
board that caused his vet>es of
the lowered tariff bills passed last
spring at the extra session, and
its much-heralded report, when it
is made, will likely he nothing
j more than a vast compilation of
figure}, leaving the matter of
tariff policy just where it was
before.
It may be questioned whether
the president's setting of eggs will
hatch out anything more than ad
ditional impatience of the people
at not seeing the tariff lowered.?

While he was attempting to
light a number of small wax
randies around the brim of the
hat worn by his half sister, Mi.-s
Lena Silbere, whom he had
selected us a partner to lead the
grand march at the masquerade
ball-given at Wonderland last
Wednesday evening by the Ely
football club, Joseph Gardner set
fire to his costume and was severely
burned about the bands arid ncck
before the mass of flames that
enveloped his body was extin
guished. The injured youth was
dressed ut the garb of Sarta CIeub,
and to scuit* the detired decora
tive effect, there was a liberal
sprinkling of cotton on the out
side of her costume. In order
I to make the scene as realisic as
possible. Gardner determined to
| have the Christmas candles blaze
forth in all their glory.
