TURKS IMPROVE IN
MILITARY AFFAIRS
Grand Maneuvers of 60,000
.Soldiers Show Ottoman Em
pire's Fighting Ability
AUTOMOBILES ARE UTILIZED
Sultan Reviews Troops Massed
in Vast Parallelogram More
Than Mile in Depth
ADRIANOPLE, Dec. 11.— The tir.st
experience of tho Turkish army in
grand maneuvers, Just finished, dem
oiiHtrated that the two years of new
rula have not b«en idle or ineffectual
from the military standpoint.
The army has forged ahead. The
fortnight's maneuvers of tiio first
(Constantinople) and second (Adrian
ople) army corps demonstrated this.
Uver 00.000 men were in the field. The
maneuvers took place in the vast
rolling prairie that stretches from
Adrianople a hundred and fifty miles
up to the very walla of Stamboul.
There Is no more dreary, lonely spot
near important civilization than this
Thracian plain, which even Baron
Illrsch's sinuous railroad cannot dot
with life.
The llrst corps, from Constantinople,
was called the army of tho east, or
the "Reds." The soldiers somewhat
advertised the latter name by their
red fezes which were a pleasing re
lief to the dark mustard or olive-green
Hults and putties of tho now Turkish
army. The second corps, from Adrlan
ople, the army of the west, was styled
the "Blues." Their fezes were of the
same businesslike color as the rest
of their clothing, and this, though a
few shades darker than the unrelieved
tones of the dried up prairie landscape,
gave a certain sense of harmony and
unity with the soil.
Infantry, cavalry, artillery, mountain
batteries und baggage trains all be
liaved remarkably well in these days
of warfare. The nights were cold and
rainy, some of the daylight hours were
hot, tho exposure was severe, but the
men showed splendid endurance and
excellent spirit. Tho infantry carried
knapsacks and luggage weighing 70
pounds, besides their Mausers.
A featuro of the maneuvers was the
automobile service of a dozen ma
chines, French and German, which,
with officers, attaches, and correspon
dents, fled over tho prairie roads and
bounced across cornfields and thistle
brakes. A large yellow car, with glass
on all sides, was especially conspicu
ous as It rushed Mahmoud Hhevket
Pasha, generalissimo of the Turkish
army, with his suite from one part of
tin conflict to another.
SULTAN REVIEWS TROOPS
Azztz Pasha, the Egytlan prince who
commands a cavalry brigade in the
Turkish urmy, was likewise conspicu
ous in a large red car which his
Egyptian chauffeur drove at unham
pered speed from point to point. There
are villagers) In the vicinity of tho
maneuvers who will, to their dying
day, tell of the wonder of that car.
At 3 o'clock on the morning of the
grand review the sultan and his party,
which included the heir-apparent.
Prince Youssouf Zaddin, and Prince
Vahdeddlu, brother of the sultan, left
Constantinople. The party arrived at
Soldier, a station 122 miles from the
city, shortly before 8 o'clock.
The review was two hours late. But
it was a great show, not at all of
brilliant coloring, but of downright
fighting strength.
A quarter of a mile broad and massed
for over a mile In depth the two army
corpa presented a dark sea with crests
0 fsteel. There was no sunshine to
light up the scene, but it appeared all
the more serious for that. The sultan,
in -a carriage with Mahmoud Shevket
Pasha and the Grand Vizier Hakki
Pasha, drovo around this vast paral-
lelogram.
At the close of the drive the defile
in front of tho sultan's tent began. It
lasted an hour and twenty minutes to
the monotonous music of the German
army march.
"Late In the afternoon a banquet for
some 300 guests, presided over by the
sultan, was given In a superb open
tent near the railroad station of Seld
ler. The sensation of the day came
when Mahmoud Shevket Pasha, creat
ing a precedent, addressed his majesty.
A part of his speech was as follows:
"Glorious sultan! Since the blessed
day of your ascent to the throne you
have followed the lines of your noble
ancestors by the high and magnani
mous favor of your constant contact
with the imperial troops, by your visit
to the drill grounds, and by your pres
ence at the maneuvers."
The sultan manifested great appre
ciation of the general's remarks, but
made no verbal reply.
At 6 o'clock the sultan was seated in
a brilliantly lighted compartment at
the very rear of hiß special train. For
an hour the train waited, and he wait
ed.
When the train finally pulled away
the sultan made the most amiable
salaams to the crowd, a lot of people
waiting to go on tn Constantinople.
They had to wait for several hours
longer, though it was a crowd which
included Ahmed Hiza Bey, president
of the chamber of deputies, the mili
tary attaches of all nations, and vari
ous high officers.
AUSTRO-HUNGARY PREPARES
TO BUILD MORE WARSHIPS
Fourth Dreadnought Will Be Laid
Down at Fiumme
VIENNA, Dec. 11.—It is announced
that the fourth of the new Austro-Hun
garian dreadnoughts will be laid down
at the Panubius private shipbuilding
yard, in Flumme, which Is to be ex
tended for the purpose. According to
Information from Budapest, the exten
sion is to be carried out with the help
of the Hungarian government, which
has bought a piece of land adjolnlns
the yard for $400,000 and will lease it
to the company at an almost nominal
rent. Further space will be gained by
filling up a small bay.
The determination of the government
to have a third dockyard besides those
at Trieste and Pola, capable of build-
Ing the largest size battleships, is evi
dence that it looks forward to a large
increase In warship construction in the
future. Hitherto Hungary has been
content that the larger war vessels
should be built in Austria, and it would
obviously not be worth while to recon
struct a shipbuilding yard for only
one vessel. Now, however, that the
policy of the monarchy is that it shall
take Its place among the other grent
power* in the International dread
nought building competition, Hungary
in determined to have her share of the
money spent on the fief'
ARREST OF JAPANESE SPY
IS REPORTED BY RUSSIANS
Czar's Officers Believe Nipponese
Have Designs on Vladivostok
oi!i:ssA. Deo. U.—A dispatch ro
oelved here from Vladivostok states
that a Japanese spy, disguised as a
fisherman, and using a small sailing
boat, has been arrested by a harbor
guard cutter close to the Chamovsky
Spit, a highly strategic point In the
immediate approach to the Russian far
eastern stronghold
Tht spy, believed to be a Japanese
naval officer, was well equipped with
hydrographle and othur survey Instru
ments. A short distance away from
the spot vvhere the arrest was made
w.is a Japanese torpedo boat, which
on observing the capture of the small
boat and its occupant Instantly put to
sea at full speed. The alleged spy will
be brought before a Vladivostok court
martial. Curiously enough, It Is a
commonly accepted belief among Rus
sian naval officers that, sooner or later,
Vladivostok and Its maritime province,
as well as the half of the island of
Sakhallen remaining under the Rus
sian flag, will pass into the possession
Qf the Japanese. \
ENGLISH DANGERS
TO TOUR AMERICA
Morris Demonstrations. Popular
Across Atlantic, May Interest
People of United States
LONDON, Dec. 11.—The old English
Morris dance, the revival of which Is
fast capturing England, is now about
to subjugate America. That is the
legitimuta conclusion, at all events,
to be drawn from the fact learned
by the Westminister Gazette—that
America is about to be taught the
Morris dance.
In a few days' time Miss Mary Nea,
tho honorary secretary of the Esper
ance Guild of Morris Hanccrs. will
leave for New York, taking with her
Miss Florence Warren, the chief danc
ing Instructress of the guild, and dur
ing four strenuous months New York,
Chicago. BoKton and Philadelphia will
lie invited to learn 'Step and Fetch
H.i," "Blue-Eyed Stranger." "Rakes
of Mallow," "Sally Luker," the "Liver
ly Jig," and as many more folk-dances
hh they liavf time for. Perhaps Miss
Warren know* the exact number of
Morris dances and country dances, the
secret of which she is able to Impart
but her friends lost count long ago.
MOVEMENT TO BE STARTED
The true.-- method of "paMing on"
will be employed in the American vis
it. When Miss Warren has done
with her pupils they will be fully
equipped to hand the dances on In the
real traditional manner. A week will
be devoted to one district of a city,
during which time thirty-six people,
children for choice, will be taught,
and when Miss Neal moves to another
district she will have left the Morris
family established behind her. "That
should start the movement In Ameri
ca," said Miss Neal today.
This scheme has come about in a
most Interesting manner. Some time
ago girls from the Esperance club
were giving a Morris demonstration
at Bridgewater house, and a ticket was
sent to Mile. Genne, who, unable to
make use of it, gave the privilege to
two American women. These were
sufficiently interested by what they
saw to visit the office of the Esper
ance guild the next day, and approach
Miss Neal as to the feasibility of In
troducing the Morris to America.
Nothing further happened for sev
eral months, nnd then Miss Neal re
ceived a letter from Miss Burbank
of New York asking her whether she
would consider a plan by which she
could visit America "to Initiate a folk
art revival on the lines she had fol
lowed in England." Miss Neal was
"to cable Just 'yes..' " It was pro
posed that the first demonstration
should be given on Christmas eve at
the McDowell club in New York, where
the teaching of Morris dancing should
form an interlude to the Christmas
festivities. Miss Neal cabled "Yes."
LECTURES Mil.l. BE GIVEN
Miss Neal, of course, will seek to
awaken interest In the revival by lec
tures, and Miss Warren will be the
practical demonstrator. There is cer
tainly no more fascinating exposition
of the origin, evelopment and aims of
the movement than that Miss Neal
can give, and the stock of stories she
has gathered In her long work among
the girls, who hail her affectionately
as "Sister Mary," w,ould humanize a
lecture upon a far less Inspiring sub
ject than folk-dancing.
Coming back from the United States,
Miss Neal Intends to visit Toronto,
for tho very first boys to learn the
Morris dance under the Esperance
movement emigrated from Newbury to
Canada, and are there fostering the
Esperance traditions. In Toronto, al
so, a number of girls from the Esper
ance club have started an institution
on lines similar to tohse of their old
hdme in Cumberland Market.
SULTAN OF MOROCCO TO
REORGANIZE HIS ARMY
Officers Fight Reform* as It Cuts
Off Their Graft
TANGIER, Dec. 11.—The sultan,
Muley Hafid, has decided to reorgan
ize his army on an improved system,
replacing the ill-disciplined horde of
troops with a smaller, but well drilled
and well equipped array. It is improb
able that more than 5000 men will be
recruited as the sultan realizes that
his army will never be required ex
cept against his own subjects, and
with that number he ought to be able
to hold his tribes in check.
The old^army is being disbanded and
only such troops as are medically fit
are being recruited. Colonel Mangln,
chief of the French Military, mission,
togther with the other French officers,
are busily engaged in introducing the
reforms. The Moorish officers, who
by all manner of corrupeion were able
to make a profitable living out of their
positions, are extremely antagonistic to
the new system, especially as the pay
ment of their men will be taken out
of their hands.
It was only by ordering all the troops
Into Fez for an inspection by himself
that his majesty was able to obtain
possession of the arms and accoutre
ments of his soldiers, as a very con
siderable portion of their rifles, etc.,
had been stolen by the officer* and
concealed in their houses.
The army appeared upon parade in
the Palace ■ square, the gates '. were
closed and the! soldiers ordered to dis
arm and take off their uniform. The
furtated officer* then saw all the loot
carried , off to the: palace. •'■■•,»"

PETROLEUM FIGHT
WILL STIR WORLD
Standard Oil's Declaration Prom
ises Fiercest Struggle in
History of Commerce
RETAIL PRICES ARE FALLING
Resources of Forces Arrayed in
Contest Will Reach Near
Billion Dollars
I,ONDON, Dec. 11.—The war in the |
petroleum trade which has been openly
declared by Standard Oil In likely to
prove one of the fiercest struggles In
commercial history. The battlefield
covers practically the whole civilized
world, while the financial resources of
the forces arrayed against each othep
probably exceed the enormous total of
$750,000,000.
Already the retail prices of both
kerosene and petrol in this country are
falling rapidly, the'severity of the
struggle being also indicated by the
heavy drop which has taken place in
the price of oil shares on the stock
exchange. '
As their greatest foe the Standard
Oil trust has oppoutd to it the Asiatic
Petroleum company, which markets
the production of an Immensely
wealthy group of companies, including
Shell Transport and Trading company,
Itoyal Dutch Petroleum company, Ba
taagsche Petroleum Maatschappij, An
-Petroleum company and the
Commercial and Mining company
(forming the Rothschild group).
1 KillTlNd FORCE THROUGH V.OKI.D
This powerful fighting force, which
controls the oil production of.' the
Dutch East Indies and has interests
in Roumanla, Gallcia and BaKy, is di
rected by Sir Marcus Samuel. Work
ing against the Standard Oil company
in Europe also are a number of vastly
wealthy Russian organizations. Ip
India and the east It meets with se
vere competition from the Burma Oil
company, which alone has a capital of
$12,500,000.
It Is officially calculated that the
money brought to the United States
by' its oil exports represents more than >
$10,000 per hour, twenty-four hours to
the day and '365 days to the year, N° j
similar statistics regarding the oppos.
ing group of companies are available,
but their equipment in the form of
pipe lines, oil carrying ships, tanks
and road and rail wagons is on an
equally vast scale.
The Standard Oil company's state
ment that they are cutting prices in
the far east in order to "increase the
world's consumption of oil" is too na
tive a declaration to receive much
credit. It is in the far east that they
come to closest grips with the Asiatic
Petroleum company, and there the
warfare will be of the bitterest and
most relentless description.
OIL BALES IX EUROPE
In the United Kingdom the kerosene
trade, apart from that controlled by
the Standard Oil trust, Is in the hands
of the British Petroleum company. The
Asiatic Petroleum company sells no
kerosene in Europe, but its trade in
benzine and petrol in this v country is
greater than that of the American
company. . .. ■ '■
Though the Standard Oil trust and
the Asiatic Petroleum company are old
enemies they have until recently had a
selling agreement. The sale by the
Asiatic company of 10,000,000 gallons of
petrol to rivals of the Standard Oil ]
trust in America, however, precipitated
a quarrel which has led to the present
war. * ' . '•
Neither the Anglo-American com
pany, which Is a branch of the Stan
dard Oil trust, nor the Asiatic Petro
leum company will undertake to book
orders for twelve months at present
prices. "

LAND DISPUTE CAUSES
RIOTING IN IRELAND
Police Club People When Grazier
Uses Farm in Contention
DUBLIN, Dec. 11.—A land dispute
over the Ballybeg farm at Tulsk, near
Castlebar, took an unexpected and ex
citing aspect the other morning, when
the grazier's stock, accompanied by
an enormous force ot police, were
driven to the farm. The farm is on the
Crofton estate, which has been pur
chased by the estates commissioners,
and is now handed over to a County
Galway grazier named Payne. In con
nection with this farm a great baton
charge by the police took place a
couple of weeks ago. The people heard
that the stock was to be driven back
to the farm and about 600 of them as
sembled at thß main entrance. One
hundred policemen under Coifnty In
spector O'Connell of Roseommon, and
District Inspector Ryan charged the
crowd and batoned them in all direc
tions.
The unfortunate people wore taken
unawares on a narrow roadway, where
they lay with blood streaming from
them. The police kicked some of the
unfortunates. One man named Healy.
a district councillor and treasurer of the.
local branch of the league, was lying
on the road with blood streaming from
wounds, one on each side of his head.
While in this condition one policeman
dragged him up, while another beat
him with his baton till the man cried
for mercy and asked them not to kill
him. Several other members of the
crowd were found lying on the road
side after the charge was over badly
cut about the head and face.
At 4 o'clock one morning this week
sixty head of cattle, accompanied by
the grazier and his men and escorted
by fifty police, started from the
grazier's residence at Ballymoe for
Ballybeg, a distance of eight miles.
The cattle, which were driven in smaU
lots, surrounded by the police, arrived
at Balllntubber before dawn. The
procession was met by another force
of fifty police under District Inspector
McLelland, Castlerea, and the whole
party proceeded to Ballybeg, where an
other torce of police were in waiting.
The plans of the drive wore kept so
secret by the authorities that owing to
the early hour at which it took place
the cattle were driven in on the fai"m
without meeting with any hostile
demonstration on the part of the
people.
Ah soon as the news spread honiK
began to blow and people began to
assemble from all direction!!. The
wildest excitement prevailed In the dis
trict, but nothing serious has occurred
up to the present time,
TO us easy to seouie a bargain In a usrrl
automobile, through want advertising, as It
vied to be—and (till Is—to secure a horse and

CONFERENCE WILL BE HELD
FOR CHANGE IN CALENDAR
Federal Council in Switzerland
to Obtain Views of Powers
OKNKVA, Dec. 11.—The federal
council has charged the political de
partment to take the necessary steps
with the object of holding an inter
national conference at Kerne to re
form the Gregorian calendar at a fu
ture date. It will be a question of
adopting the project of the Genevese
named Grosclaude, who divided the
year into 364 days, leaving out New
Year's day, which will always follow
a Sunday and not bf: dated.
In blsextlle years the day between
June 31 and July 1 is also not dated.
Every three months have 30, 3n and 31
days, and the month? of March, June.
September and December have 31 days,
tile 3lßt falling always on a Sunday.
It Is only when the political depart
ment has sounded the different powi rs
and made a report to the federal gov
ernment that a date will be fixed for
the conference. The Vaterlanu of Lu
cerne slates that the Vatican is not
opposed to the reform. At the inter
national commercial congress, held in
London last June, the chamber of
commerce requested the federal coun
cil to undertake the task <>f calling
an international meeting and it agreed.
WAR ON TRAFFIC
IN WHITE SLAVES
Delegates at International Con
gress in Madrid Discuss
Growing Evil
PARIS, Dec. 11.— A remarkable
growth In the movement against the
white slave traffic is reported by XV. A.
Coote, who has <ust returned from the
international congress in Madrid.
"At no previous gathering of the
■ kind" he said to a Westminster Ga
i zette representative, "has there been so
much official recognition from the Eu
ropean governments. Among the 4001
deWgtaes there were eleven official rep- |
resentatives of the Spanish govern- j
ment, and at each of the eight sittings
the deliberations were attended by
Princess Isabella and Princess Paz of
Bavaria. The governments of Germa
ny, Argentina, Austria-Hungary, Bel
glum, Chile and Denmark were also
I officially represented; and Great Brit-
I am, the headquarters of the Interna
tional bureau, took a prominent part in
i the discussions. The Interest of the
clergy was sufficiently Indicated by the
] presence among the delegates of six
archbishops and a score of bishops."
Mr. Coote said it had been clearly
shown by the reports of the various
national committees that the laws deal-
Ing with this repulsive business had in
several Instances been considerably
strengthened. "Austria, Germany, Hun
gary, France and Holland," he said,
"have all made good progress in this
direction since our last conference."
LAWS AGAINST SLAVE MEN
Each country now has a special de
partment for dealing with this matter
in connection wtih the police organiza
tion, and the reports from these cen
ters all indicate that the white slave
drivers are having anything but a good
time.
"Laws are one thing," commented
Mr. Coote, "but It was shown that In
connection with this work we have
repressive legislation, well supported by
zealous administration, with the result
that throughout the continental cities
the tracking and conviction of these
criminals Is proceeding vigorously. For
this happy activity we have largely to
thank the women of Europe and Amer
ica, who have entered the lists on be
half of their sisters with an enthusiasm
that makes success assured.
, "The International Catholic associa
tion, through their committees of ladies
at the continental railway stations, has
dealt with 200,000 young women during
the past year—advising some, helping
others and taklne active steps, where
necessary, to save them from a perilous
position. Another organization of la
dies, Les Amies de la Jeune FJHe, ope
rating in Switzerland, reported that
several thousands of young women had
been met and befriended at the end of ■
their railway Journeys.
"The governments and peoples of the
civilized world," said Mr. Coote in con
clusion, "are at last recognizing that
the root cause of this trouble is to •be
found in the economic situation in re
gard to women; and this phase of the
question is being dealt with increasing
ly by the national committees. So
great has been the growth of public
opinion on this subject, as revealed by
the Madrid congress, that we shall look
forward with confidence and hope to
the next International gathering, which
will be held in London three years
hence." ,-.-•.■ '
ALBANIANS WON'T SUBMIT
TO RULE BY YOUNG TURKS
Government to Continue a Policy
of Severity
ATHENS, Dec. 11.—It is reported that
at the meeting of the Young Turkish
committee, recently convoked at Mon
astir, it was decided to approve all
measures taken by the military com
mittee to procure disarmament of the
Christians in Macedonia. The govern
ment was advised to continue a policy
of severity, and orders were given to
Turkish bands to massacre twelve
Christians in revenue for six Turks
killed by Bulgarians, 870 of whom are
at present confined in prison at Mon
astir.
Numerous bands of Albanians have
appeared in the district of Divri, all
of them old members of revolutionary
committees. There are betwen 2000 and
4000 in the mountains, and these bands
descend to the villages and declare that
they will never submit to the authori
ties. They deny the assertion of Tur
ghut Pasha that order is re-established
and that Albania has submitted.
The Albanian chief, Kara Lasaan,
who is at the head of a thousand men,
demands from the Turkish authorities
an amnesty for all Albanians in pris
on. If his request be not complied with
he threatens to carry on a guerrilla
warfare against the Turks. In the
meantime all the Albanians are pre
paring for resistance this winter. They
are busy driving herds of cattle Into
winter quarters preparatory to a gen
eral movement In the spring.

KAISER'S SUBJECTS
DEMAND REFORM
Government of Alsace and Lor
raine to Be Changed in
Constitution
UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE COMING
Socialists, Center Party and Old
German Party Disagree on
Proposed Switch
hkjm.lN, Dec, 11..—The fervent de
sire of the Inhabitant! of Alsace and
; Lorraine to b<- placed on a political
lit;.- with the. other states com
ptMlng thi German empire will, to a
1.1 tain exent, shortly be realised.
The bill embodying proposals for the
n form ot the constitution of the
Relchaland has already r fived the
placet of the emperor and of the
Prussian ministry of state, and Is now
being considered by the federal coun
cil of the empire. After it passes the
Federal council it will be laid before
Reichstag, and it Is hoped that
the new order of things will come In
to effect on July 1, 1!»U.
Sine til" year 1877 the laws fnr Al
sace and Lorraine have been Issued
by the emperor, with the concurrence
of the federal council of the empire
and the acquiescense of the Land*
Ausschuss, though the acquiescence
of the latter local body could always
be replaced by the assent of the
Reichstag.
The imperial government has made
great concessions to the Inhabitants
of Alsace and Lorraine, if it lias net
gone so far as many of them wish.
The population is very democratic,
and it is, moreover, prepared to re
sist with its most strenuous efforts
any attempt to "Prussify" it. The
1 Tenter party in Alsace-Lorraine has
demanded that the new state .shall be
grunted full autonomy, while the 80
--! clalist party demands a republican
form of government; the old German
party, on the other hand, which Is
anxious that Germanizing influences
Khali predominate, fears that too
much independence Is being placed in
tho hands of people who cannot yet
be quite trusted. There seems to be
general satisfaction over the pros
pect of obtaining- a second chamber
to which the deputies will be elected
on the basis of universal suffrage with
equal, direct and secret voting (for
which the Radicals and Socialists in
Prussia Itself have so long struggled
In vain), but opinions are divided on
the subject of the first chamber.
VIEWS ARE OPPOSING
The Center, Democratic and Socialist
parties consider that the introduction
of a first chamber is in itself a-retro
gressive step, and fear that reaction
will be served by the manner of its
composition. The opposing parties, on
the other hnnd, desire a first chamber
that will act not only as a check to
the progress of Socialism, but also as a
safeguard against the encouragement
of non-German influences.
It is understood that the proposals
for the constitution of the first cham
ber are on the following lines: In the
first place, it will include several mem
bers whose official position naturally
entitles them to belong to it; that is
to say, the Roman Catholic bishops of
Ktrassburg and Metz, the president of
the supreme court of justice at Kol
mar, the president of the high consist
ory of the churches of the Augsburg
confession, and the president of the
synod of the Reformed churches.. Fur
thermore, as elected members, one or
dinary professor of the university of
Strassburg, one member each from the
town councils of Strassburg, Metz, Kol
mar and Mulhausen, one representative
of the three Jewish consistories for
Lower Alsace, Upper Alsace and Lor
raine, a representative of each of the
chambers of commerce of Strassburg
and Metz and one representative for
the two chambers of commerce of Kol
mar and Mulhausen, three representa
tives of the agricultural council, one
representative of the chamber of trades
and handicrafts for "Alsace-Lorraine,
and, should legal bodies representing
th« workmen be established, one to
three representatives of theso corpora
tions. In addition to these ex-off)clo
and elected members there are to be
others nominated by the emperor at
tlio luffgestipn of thp federal council;
the members thus nominated may,
however, never exceed In number the
half of ill the members of the first
chamber.

The piece deals with the times, and in

TO BURY CHILD IN FRANCE
French Premier Grants Singular
Request of Noted Fugitive

M. Briand. This was that he should
be granted a safe conduct to enable
him to return and bury in French soli
his little Rlrl who had just died at
Mons at the age of 4 years.
It is impossible to giant a safe con
duct to persons who have fled from
justice in France, but M. Briand, who
la by no means the brutal despot that

informed M. Pataud that the execution
of the warrant would be suspended
sufficiently long to enable him to carry
out his desire.
FRENCH EMPLOYERS MAY
UNITE FOR PROTECTION
Labor Disorders May Cause Or
ganization of Capital
PARIS, Dec. 11.—The growth of
grave disorders arising out Of labor
dispute* and fomented by the Confed
.>r;itinn General* 'lv Travail, or work
men's association of. trade unions and
trade oounclls, has suggested to em
ployers of labor the necessity of a de
fensive organization. Under the aus
malnly of the building trade n
meeting attended by some 2000 per-sonn
was accordingly held in the Cirque de
Paris. The order of the day called \
attention to the "constant agitation
which sin.c 1006 has been excited in
the building trade by the Confedera
tion Generate dv Travail," and invited
contractors, architects, house proprie
tors Interested parties to
form an organisation against the com
mon peril.
The principal speaker, M. Villemain,
■ r ins United Builders' asso
ciations, characterised the Confedera
tion Generate as "an organization
which skillfully took advantage of mil
those lawa which were favorable to
tlvitiea and treated the rest with
In." During the past, year the
Confederation Generate had been re
ft) strikes, which hi
; represented b lorn of 1800,000 in
The time had come for em
ployers to ((insider whether they were
to stand aside and allow their Inter
ests to be'annihilated or to take action
and oppose a policy of evolution to
that of revolution.
Four resolution* were then adopted
dealing with the necessities of the sit
uation and tbe recent action of the
government in the railway strike, of
which the fourth declared it to be in
tolerable that trade unions or federa
tions of unions should under th»; guise
of corporate aotlvlty exceed the limits
of the sphere which was assigned to
them by IIW as labor organizations.
Tn this connei tion the meeting paid a
tribute to the courage and firmness
which had been exhibited by M. Rri
and, the premier, in confronting the
revolutionary movement excited on the
occasion of the recent railway strike,
and congratulated the majority of the
chamber of deputies on the support
which it had given to the prime minis
ter. The meeting called upon the gov
ernment and the chamber to give ef
fect to its just desires. Finally a res
olution was adopter) in favor of a great
organization of employers, more es
pecially in the building and allied
trades, for the defense of property and
of common Interests,

DECISION SPEEDS
MARKET RECOVERY
Exoneration of Transportation
Companies from Charges
Stimulates Stock Dealing
FARM OUTPUT IS ENORMOUS
Money Stiffens During Week;
Cash Outflow to West and
South Continues
[Associated Press]
NEW YORK, Dec. 11.—Quite the
most important event last week in the
stock market was the decision of. the
federal court in the Pennsylvania dis
trld declaring the Temple Iron com
pany an illegal corporation, but other-
RQStainlng the main contentions
of the several coal-carrying railroads
which control it.
The decision freed the transportation
companies from rharges of general con.
splracy in violation of the interstate
commerce laws, and was hailed with
satisfaction. Its influence was felt lv
the recovery of the market from Its
irregular and narrow tone of the days
immediately preceding.
JIKSH.MSK PLEASES MARKKX
The week, otherwise, was dull and
uninteresting. Such buying power or
disposition as was manifested at odd
momenta came almost entirely from
the short interest, with a sprinkling of
odd lot buying, much of which was
reported to be for foreign account.
President Taft's message was well
received and gave heart to the leading
financial interests, but was otherwise
an inconsiderable market factor.
Unusual interest was manifested in
the annual report of the secretary of
the treasury, more particularly the
recommendation urging reform in our
banking and currency systems. Fig
ures embraced in the yearly statement
of the secretary of agriculture called
renewed attention to the record-break
ing corn crop, while the sum total of
all farm products is so vast as almost
to stagger the imagination.
CASH OUTFI/OW CONTINUES
Money stiffened here during tha
week and the cash outflow to western
and southern points continued. For
eign exchange fell to the lowest point
in four months and negotiations for
imports of gold from London were
under way.
Complete official returns from Wash
ington show slight reduction of the
loan account by national banks in the
west, middle west and south, but the
cash resourfces of the combined na
tional banks are well above legal re
quirements.
Railroad earnings were in keeping
with those issued for months past.
General trade conditions are better,
mercantile lines having been materially
assisted by the colder weather.
United States 3s and registered 4s
advanced Vi of 1 per cent on the week.
