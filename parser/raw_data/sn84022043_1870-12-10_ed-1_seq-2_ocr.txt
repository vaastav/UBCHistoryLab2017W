Tbt- Republican journal* u( this State and
of California since the ele ction have attempted
n-jestwilv to pourtheboltn of conMation into
the hearts of their friends. and while utrr
admit that their defeat was only "retributive
justice following swift upon the heels of vio
lated law." They take new courage by
telling ns that "we can no do it again:"
"it is not a Democratic victory;" "the
unfortunate awsociations o4 otrr guberna- I
torial candidate caused our defeat." and such
like empty declamations. To our Republican '
friends ar say. if such talk gives you hope it
gives us no fear.
Our victory over the Republican party is
for all time. Othet combinations may arise
in after years to cause the Democracy defeat. 1
but neither the principles nor the name of the
late Republican party will enter into those
combinations. Dead beyond a question, they
have no spriukliug of truth with which to
?gain Its leading characters in the East, who
made that party, more clearly see its doom,
and have already subsidized a venal press to
echo the cry of "Sew party," "Reform party"
or some such terms with which to tickle the
oars of the too credulous public.
While the abandonment of the Republican
party to its fate by such men as "Dirty Dv>g"
Logan and that old devotee of Celestial per
fection, Lyman Trumbull, is natural, and has
been expected, we can not believe that their
Call for a new party will meet with an appvrov- j
ins response from the p?eople. lhe jeojJe j
know the corruption of the Republican putty,
and if it ever had any miss: n of good to per
form, that mission by the declaration f tt
leadrrs is ended and tt stands Uvw as a rv'.ic I
of the past.
* ,
How then is this to affect the Democracy ?
The answer is cbvioua. The masses will re
turn and remaiu with the tune-honored Dein
ocracy, while the Radical leaders wiU go I
searching after strange gods. We as a party !
have every element of perpetuity; our an
cient name is dear to the hearts of the people.

the Impeachment Case; and Glances behind

To a question, asys the Reporter. as to what
he thought of Grant's mental power. Gen- 1
Ashley replied: "Why, if a man lives iu a vtl- j
lage by the Mississippi carrying hides in and ,
out of some tannery for a living, and none ot j i
his neighbors Know who he is. I can't see ( J
where or how he stowed away his brains." I
Ashley has won the uamc of "the grew! no- i

since the construction <*f the 1'ccidc railroad. ,
has there been any practical reduction of ores
by the smelting process, for the eery gocd
reason that Vase metal or galena bearing ores
had ao? in any quantity been discovered.
The tirst general shipment of base bullion
was from White Fine, since which time the
discoveries of new districts of smelting ore
hare been of almost daily occurrence. The
distance on the line of the Fscific railroad m
which such ores are found is about 5W miles,
taking its western limit .-a Ore ana and its east
ern at the mines near Salt Lake City. Sow,
should extensive works be put up at SunFran
cisco or Chicago, the owmrs of mines, or
dealers in .res. would be snbjevtedin either in
stance to the enormous expense of hundreds
of miles of railr .H transportation. Prcui the
eastern limit of the base metal region to
Chicago is 1..V* miles and from its western
limit to San Francisco is XX) miles- While
