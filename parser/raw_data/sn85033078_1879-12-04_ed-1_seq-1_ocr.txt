PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Fellow Citizens of the -A* and House of Hep
resentatives:
CONGRATULATORY.
The members of the Forty-sixth Congress have
assembled in their first regular session under cir
cumstances calling for mutual congratulation and
grateful acknowledgment to the Giver of all good
for the large and unusual measure of national
prosperity which we now enjoy.
The most interesting events which have occurr
ed in our public affairs since ray last amnia! mes
sage to congress are connected w ith tlie financial
operations of the government directly affecting
the business interests of the country. I congratu
late congress on the successful execution of the
resumption act. At the time fixed and in the
manner contemplated by law, United States notes
began to be redeemed in coin. Since the first ot
January last they have been promptly redeemed
on presentation, and in all business transactions,
public and private, fa all parts of the country,
they are received and paid out as the equivalent
of coin. The demand upon the treasury for gold
and silver in exchange for United States notes lias
been comparatively small, and the voluntary de
posit of coin and bullion in exchange for notes
has been very large. The excess of the precious
metals deposited or exchanged for United States
notes over Ihe amount of United States notes re
deemed is about §10,000,000.
RESUMPTION.
The resumption of specie payments has been
followed by a very great revival of business.
W illi a currency equivalent in value to the money
of the commercial world, we are enabled- to enter
upon an equal competition with other nations in
trade and production. The increasing foreign de
mand for our manufactures and agricultural pro
ducts lius cuused a large balance of trade in our
favor, which has been paid in gold, from the Ist
of July last, to November 15, to the amount of
about $59,000,000. Since the resumption of specie
payments there has also been a marked and grati
fying improvement of the public credit. The
bonds of the government bearing only four per
cent, interest have been sold at or above par, suf
ficient in amount to pay off all of the national
debt which was redeemable under present laws.
The amount of interest saved annually by tbe
process of refunding the debt, since March 1, 1877,
is $11,297,177. The bonds sold were largely in
small sums, and tbe number of our citizens now
bolding the public securities is much greater than
ever before. The amount of the national debt
which matures within less than two years is $792,-
1:11,700, of which §500,000,000 hear interest at the
rate of five per cent., and the balance is in bonds
hearing six per cent, interest. It is believed that
this part of the public debt can be refunded by tiic
issue of fo .r per cent, bonds, and, bv the reduc
tion ot interest which will thus be effected, about
eleven millions ol dollars can be annually saved
to the treasury. To secure this important reduc
tion of interest to he paid by the United States,
further legislation is required, which, it is hoped,
will be provided by congress during its present
session.
COINAGE.
The coinage ot gold by the minis of the United
States, during the last fiscal year was $40,981>,!(12.
'l'he coinage of silver dollars, since the passage of
the act, for that purpose, up io November 1, ISVit,
was $15,000,850, of which *12,700,344 have been is
sued from the treasury and are now in circulation
and $32,:t00,5U0 are still iu the possession of the
government.
The pendency of the proposition for unity of ac
tion between the United States and the principal
commercial nations of Europe, to effect a perma
nent system for the equality of gold and silver in
the recognized money of thewotld, leads me to
recommend that congress terrain from new legis
lation on the general subject. The great revival
of trade, internal and foreign, will supply, during
the coming year, its own insrraettons, which may
well be awaited before attempting further expeii
meutal measures with the coinage. I would,
however, strongly urge upon congress the import
ance of authorizing the secretary of the treasury
to suspend the coinage of silver dollars upon the
present legal ratio. The market value of the sil
ver dollar being uniformly and largely less than
the market value of the gold dollar, it is obvious
ly impracticable to maintain them at par with
each other if both are coined without limit. If
the cheaper coin is forced into circulation tt will,
II coined without limit, soon become the sole
standard of value, and thus defeat the desirea
objec', which is a currency of both gold and sil
ver, which shall he of equivalent value, dollar for
dollar, with the universally recognized money of
the world.
RETIREMENT fF GREENBACKS.
The retirement from circulation of United
States notes, with the capacity of legal-tender iu
private contracts. Is a step to lie taken in our pro
gress towards a safe and stable currency, which
should be accepted as the policy and duty of the
government, uud the interest and security of the
people. It is my firm conviction that the issue of
legal-tender paper money based wholly upon the
authority and credit of the government, except iu
extreme emergency, is without warrant in the
constitution, and a violation of sound financial
principles. The issue of United States netes dur
ing the late civil war with the capacity of it gal
tender between private Individuals was not au
thorized except as a means of rescuing the
country from imminent peril. The circulation of
these notes as paper money, for any protracted
period of time after the accomplishment of this
purpose, was not contemplated by the framers of
the law under which they were issued. They an
ticipated the redemption and withdrawal oi these
notes at the earliest practicable period consis
tent with the attainment cf the object for which
they were provided.
PATINO THE WAR DEBT.
The policy of the United States, steadily ad
hered to from the adoption of tne constitution,
has been to avoid the creation of a national debt,
end when, from necessity in time of war, debts
have been created, they have bean paid off on ths
return of peace as rapidly us possible. With this
view, and for this purpose, it is recommended that
the existing laws for the accumulation of a sink
ing fund tufliciont to extinguish the public
debt within a limited period be maintained. If
any change of the objects or rates ot taxation is
deemed necessary by congress, it is suggested
that experience has shown that a duty can be
placed on tea and coffee, which will not enhance
the price of those articles to the consumer, and
which will add several millions of dollars an
nually to the treasury. /
POET J.ITTi
The continued deliberate violation bv a large
number of the prominent and influential citizens
o: the territory of Utah of the laws of the United
States lor the prose.-ition and punishment of
polygamy demands the attention t every depart
ment of the government. This tetritory has a
population sufficient to entitle it to admission as
a stale, aud the general interest of the nation, as
will as the welfare* f the ettizsus of the terri
tory, require its advance from the territorial form
of government to the responsibilities and priv
ileges of a state. This important change will
nut, however, be approved by the country while
tbs citizen-* of Utah iu very considerable number
uphold a practice which is condemned as a crime
ny the laws of all ivil zed communities through
out the world.
ihe law for the sunuessu'n of th’S offence was
enacted with great unanimity by congress nso'-e
than seventeen year* ago, but has remained until
recently a dead letter in the territory of Utah,
because of the peculiar difficulties attending its
enforcement. The opinion widely prevailed
among the citizens of Utah that the law was in
c °ntravention of the cons'ltuiioaal guarantee of
religions freedom. This objection i* now remov
ed. The supreme court of the United Ftates haa
decided the law to lie within the legislative power
of congress, and binding as a rale cf action for
all who reside within the territories, There is
no longer any reason for delay or hesitation iu
its enforcement. It should be firmly and effect
ively executed. If not sufficiently stringent, in
its provisions it should be amended, and, in aid
ot the purpose in view. I recommend that more
comprehensive and more searching method* for
preventing as well as punishing this crime bo
provided. If necessary to secure obedience to
the law, the enjoyment and exercise of the rights
aud privileges of citizenship in the territories of
the United States may be withheld or withdrawn
from those who violate oroppose the enforcement
ot the law oa this subject.
ELECTIVE FRANCHISE,
The elections of the past year, though occupied
only with state offices, have not failed to elicit in
the political discussions which attended them ah
over the country, new and decisive evident* of
the deep interest which the great body of citizens
take la the progress of the country towards a
more general and complete establishment, at
whatever cost, of universal security and ireedom
in the exercise of the elective franchise. While
many topics of political concern demand great
attention from our people, both in the sphere of
national and state authority, 1 find no reason to
qualify the opinion I expressed in my last annual
message, that no temporary or administrative in
terests of government, however argent or weighty,
will ever displace the zeal of our people in de
fence of the primary rights of citizenship, and
that the power of public opinion will override all
political prejudices, and all sectional and state
attachments, iu demanding that all over our
wide territory the name and character of Citizen
of the United States shall mean one and the same
thing, and carry with them unchallenged security
and respect. I earnestly appeal to the intelli
gence and patriotism of all good citizens of every
part of the conntty, however much they may be
divided in opinions on other political subjects, to
unite in compelling obedience to existing laws
aimed at the protection of the right of suffrage.
I respectfully urge upon congress to supply any
defects in these laws which experience has shown
aud which it is within Its power to remedy. I
again invoke the co-operation of the executive
and legislative authorities of the states in this
great purpose. I am fully convinced that if the
public mind can be set at rest on this paramount
question of popular rights, no serious obstacle
will thwart or delay the complete pacification ol
lu2 country, or retard th-3 general diffailon of
prosperity.
CIVIL SERVXC I.
In a former mcisage I invited th* attention of
congress to the subject cf the icformation o! the
civil service of the government, aed expressed
the intention of transmitting to congress as early
as practicable a report upon this subject by the
chairman of the civil service commission.
In view cf the facts that, during a considerable
period, the government ot Great Britain has been
dealing with administrative problems and
abases, in various particulars analogous to those
presented in this country, and that in recent
years the measures adopted were understood to
have been effective and in every respect highly
satisfactory, I thought it desirable to have fuller
information upon the subject, and accordingly re
quested the chairman of the civil service tom
mission to make a thorough investigation for
this pnrpoie. The result has been an elaborate
and comprehensive report.
The report sets forth the h.storv of the partlsa. -
spoils system in Great liritain, and of the rite
and fall of the parliamentary patronage, and of
official interference with the freedom of elections.
It shows that after long trials of various kinds of
examinations, those which yra competitive and
open on equal terms to all, p.ad which are carried
ou under tue superiutt ndence of a single commis
sion, have, with great advantage, been establish
ed as conditions of admission to slmost every
official place in the subordinate administration of
that country and of British India. The comple
tion of the rcpoit, owing to the extent of the labor
involved in its preparation, and the omission of
congress to make any provision either for the
com peusatioa or the expense of the commission,
has been postponed until the present time. It is
herewith transmitted to congfess.
While the refmn measures of auothc. govern
ment are cfno authority for us, they are entitled
to iiitiuence, to the extent to which their intrinsic
wisdom and their adaptation lo our institutions
and social life may commend them to our consid
eration.
The view* I have heretofore expressed concern
ing the defects and abuses in oar civil administra
tion remain unchanged, except in to far as an
enlarged experience has deepened my sense cf
the duty both of officers and of the people them
rclvea to co-opcrato for their removal. Th* grave
ev;! and perils ofa partisan-spoils sy*lem of ap
pointment to office and cf office tenure, are now
generally recognized. In the resolutions of the
great parlies, in the reports of departments, in the
debates and proceedings of congress, in the mes
sages of executives. th* gravity of these evils has
been pointed out and the need of their reform
has been admitted.
To command the necessary support, every meas
ure of reform must be based on common right and
justice, and must ba compatible with the healthy
existence of great parties, which are inevitabia
and essential to a gient and free slats.
When the people have approved a policy at a
national election, confidents on tha part of ihe
officers they have se ected, and of the adviser*
who, in accordance with our political institutions,
should be consulted, in tbe policy which it is tbeir
duty to carry into effect, la :ade*pensib!e. It is
eminently proper that they should explain it be
fore the people, as ! well as il'utirate its spirit in
ihe performance of tlietr official duties.
Very different considerations appiy to the
greater number of those w<> fill the subordinate
places iu the civil service hair responsibility
is to their superiors in ■ file - ';■*! position. It is
their duty to obey the leg.J instructions of those
upon whom that authority is devolved, and their
bast public service cotisi-d-; i.*i the discharge of
their functrons irrespective of partisan politics,
their duties are the same, whatever party Is iu
power en i whatever policy prevails. Asa con
sequence it follows thrt their tenure of oflice
should not depend on the prevalence of auv
poii* y or the supremacy of any party, but should
ba determined by their capacity to serve the
people most usefully, quite irrespective of parti
san interests. The same considerations that
should govern the tenure, U uld also prevail in
the appointment, discipline, and removal of
these subordinates. The authority of appoint
ment and lemoval is not a perquisite, which may
be used to aid a friend or reward a partisan, but
is a trust to be exercised Ii the public interest,
Un'lOl Ml Wo ••mtiM.' -. ui. >. ,lu.d Ui.
tion to apply the public funds only for public
purposes.
Every citizen has an equal right to the honor
and protit of entering the public service ot his
cjumry. The only just ground of discrimination,
is the measure of .character and capacity he his
to make that service most useful to the people.
Except in cases where, upon just and recognized
principles, as upon the theory of pensions, offices
and promotions are bestowed as rewards for past
services, their bestowal upon any theory which
disregards personal merit, is an act of injustice
to the citizens, as well as a breach of that trust
subject to which the appointing power is held.
In the light of these principles, it becomes of
great importance to provide just and adequate
moans, especially for every department, and largo
administrative office, where personal discrimina
tion on the part of its head is not practicable, for
ascertaining those qualifications to which ap
pointments and removals should have reference.
To fail to provide such means is not only to deny
the opportunity of ascertaining the facts upon
which the most righteous claim to office depends,
but, of necessity, to discourage all worthy aspi
rants, by handing over appointments and remov
als to more influence and favoritism. If it is the
right of the worthiest claimant to gain the ap
pointment, aud the interest of the people to be
stow it upon him, it would seem clear that a wise
and just method of ascertaining personal fitness
for otlice must be an important and permanent
function of every just and wise government. It
lias long since become impossible, in the great of
fices, for those having the duty of nomination and
appointment, to personally examine into the in
dividual qualifications of more than a small pro
portion of those seeking office; aud, with the on-
largement of the civil service, that proportion
must continue to become loss.
lu the earlier years of the government, the sub
ordinate offices were so few in number that it was
quite easy for those making appointments and
promotions to personally ascertain the merits of
candidates. Party managers and methods had
not then become powerful agencies of coercion,
hostile to the free and just exercise of the ap
pointing power.
A large and responsible part of the duty of res
toring the civil service to the desired purity and
efficiency rests with the president, and it is my
purpose to do what is within my power to ad
vance such prudent and gradual measures of re
form as will most surely aud rapidlv bring about
that radical change of system essential to make
our administrative methods satisfactory to a free
aud intelligent people. By a proper exercise of
it is in the power of the executive to do
much to promote such a reform. But it cannot
be too clearly understood that nothing adequate
can be accomplished without co-operation on the
part of congress and considerate and intelligent
support among the people. Reforms which chal
lenge the generally accepted theories of parties,
and demand changes in the methods of depart
ments. are not the work of a day. Their perma
nent foundations must be laid in'sound principles
and in an experience w hich demonstrates their
wisdom and exposes the errors of their adversar
es. Every worthy officer desires to make his of
ficial action a gain and honor to ids country, hut
the people themselves, far more than their officers
in public station, are interested in a pure, econom
ical, and vigorous administration.
By laws enacted in ISJ3 aud 18-V5. aud now in sub
stance incorporated In the Revised .Statutes! me
practice of arbitrary appointments to the several
subordinate grades in tbo great departments was
condemned, and examinations, as to capacity, to
be conducted by departmental boards of examin
ers. were provided for and made conditions cf ad
mission to ttie public service. These statutes are
a decision by Congress that examination of some
sort, as to attainments and capacity, are essential
to the well-being of the public service. The im
portant questions since ihe enactment of these
1 iws have been as to the character of these exam
inations, and whether official favor and part san
influence, or common right and merit, were to con
trol Hie access to the examinations. In practice
these examinations have not always been open to
worthy poisons generally who might wish to be
examined. Official favoritism and partisan influ
ence, as rui(\ appear to have designated those
who alone were permitted to go before theexim
imng-boards, subjecting even the examiners to a
pressure from the friends of the candidates very
difficult to resist. Asa consequence, the standard
of admission fell below that which the public in
terest demanded. It was also almost inevitable
that a system which provided for various separate
boards of examiners, with nocommon supervision
or uniform method of procedure, should result la
confusion, inconsistency, and inadequate tests of
e ipacity highly detrimental to t lie public interests.
A turther and more radical change was obviou ly
required.
in tbo annual message of December. 1870, my
predecessor declared tiiac "there is no duty which
jo much embarrasses the executive and heads of
departments as that of appointments: nor is there
any such arduous ami thankless labor imposed on
senators and representatives as that of finding
places for constituents. The present system does
not secure the best men. aud otcen not even fit men
for the public places. The elevation and purifica

act, approved March 3,1871, "to regulate the civil
service of the United Slates and promote the effi
ciency thereof," giving the necessary authority to
the executive to inaugurate a civil-service re
form .
Acting under this statute, which was interpreted
as intended to secure a system of just aud effectual
examinations under uniform supervision a num
ber of eminently competent persons were selected
for the purpose, who entered with zeal upon the
discharge of thetr duties, prepared, with an irrei
ligent appreciation of the requirements of t he ser
vice, the regulations contemplated, aud took
C' ■'.'ge of the examinations, and who. in thclf ca
ll -ity as a board, have been known as the ‘•Civil
service Commission. Congress for two vcars ap
propriated the money needed for the composi

of the commission.
It appears from the report of the commission,

influences prejudicial to good administration. The
been enforced, have
beneficially, as is shown bv the opinions
of the members of the cabinet and'their subordi
nates in the departments, ana in that opinion I
concur. And in the annual luessn&c of December
ot the same year similar views are expressed, and
an appropriation for continuing the work of the
commission again advised.
'I he appropriation was not made, and, as a conse
quence the active work of the commission was
suspended, leaving the commission itself still iu
existence. \\ ithout the means, therefore, of caus
ing qualifications to be tested in any systematic
manner, or of securing for the public service the
advantages of competition upon any extensive
plan, 1 recommended in my annual message of
December, itui, the making of an apnrpriation
for the resumption of the work of the commis
sion.
in the meantime, however, competitive exam
inations under many embarrassments have been
conducted within limited spheres in the execu
tive departments in Washington, and in a num
ber of the custom houses and post offices of the
principal cities of the country, with n view to
lurthcr test their effects, and, in every instance,
they Lave been lound to be as salutary as they
are stated to have been under the administration
of my predecessor. 1 think the economy, purity
and efficiency cf the public service would be
greatly promoted by their systematic introduc
tion. wherever practicable, throughout the entire
civil service of the government, together with
ample provision for their general supervision, in
order to secure consistency and uniform justice.
lieports from the secretary of the interior, from
the postmaster-genera!, from the postmaster in
the city of New York, where such examinations
have been some time on trial, and aim from the
collector of the port, the naval officer, and the
surveyor infchat city, and from the postmasters
and collectors in several of the other large cities,
show that the competitive system, where applied,
has, in various ways, contributed to improve the
public service.
The reports show that the results have been sal
utary iu a marked degree, and that the general
application of similar rules cannot fail to be of
decided benefit to the service.
The reports ot the government officers, in the
city of New York especially, bear decided testi
mony to the utility ol open competitive examina
tions In their respective offices, showing that
“ these examinations, and the excellent qualifica
tions of those admitted to the service through
them, have had a marked incidental effect upon
the persons previously in the service, and partic
ularly upon those aspiring to promotion. There
has been, on the part ol these latter, an increased
interest m the work, and a desire lo extend ac
quaintance with it beyond the particular desk oc
cupied, and thus the morale ot the entire force
has been raised. * * * The examinations have
been attended by many citizens who have had an
opportunity to thoroughly investigate the scope
and character of the tests and the method of de
termining tho results, and those visitors have,
without exception, approved the methods em
ployed, and several of them have publicly attest
ed their favorable opinion.”
Upon such considerations, I deem it my duty to
renew the recommendation contained in my an
nual message of December, 1877, requesting con
gress to make the necessary appropriation for
the resumption of the work of the civil service
com mission. Economy will be promoted by au
thorizing a moderate compensation to persons in
the public service who may perform extra labor
upon or under the commission, as the executive
may direct.
I am convinced that if a just and adequate
Jt-st of merit is enforced for admission to the pub
lic service and in making promotions, such
abuses as removals without good cause and par
tisan and official interference with the proper
exercise of the appointing power, will iu‘ large
measure disappear.
There are other administrative abuses to which
the attention of congress should be asked in this
connection. Mere partisan appointments, and
the constant peril of removal without cause, very
foitcrany lead to an .•Absorblng'and mischievous
pOlltlCS.! activity, UU lUO paft Ui iuumi uius ap—
pointed, which not only interferes with the due
discharge of official duty, but is incompatible
with the freedom oi elections. Not without
warrant, in the views if several of my predeces
sors in the presidential office, and directly with
in the law of 1871, already cited. I endeavored,
by tcgulatiou, made on the 2-Jd day of June, 1877,
to Jim some reasonable limit to such abuses. It
may not be easy, and it may never perhaps be
necessary, to define with precision the proper
limit of political action on the part oficderal
ofliceis. but while their right to hold and freely
express their opinions cannot be questioned, it
is very plain that they should neither be allowed
to devote to other subjects the time needed for
proper discharge of their official duties, nor to use
tue authority of their office to enforce their
own opinions, or to coerce the political action of
those who hold different opinions.
Hensons of justice and public policy, quite
analogous to those which forbid the use of of
ficial power for the oppression of the private
citizen, impose upon the government tbo duty
of protecting its officers and agents from arbi
trary exactions. In whatever aspect considered,
the practice of making levies, for parly purpose*,
upon the salaries of officers is highly demoraliz
ing to the public service and discreditable to the
country. Though an officer should be as free as
any other citizen, gir o his money in aid of his
opinions or his party, he should also he as free as
any other citizen to refuse to make such gifts. 1/
salaries are but a fair compensation for the time
and labor of the officer, it is a gross injustice to
levy a tax upon them. If they are made exces
sive in order that they may bear the tax, the ex
ce s is an Indirect robbery of the public funds.
I recommend, therefore, such a revision and
extension of present statutes a* Jshall secure to
tnosa in every grade of official life or public em
ployment the protection with which a gieat and
enlightened nation should guard those who ai a
faitofnl in Us service.
OCR RELATIONS, WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES UAVE
CONTINUED PEACEFUL.
Wuh Great Britain there are still unsettled
questions, growing out of the local laws of the
maritime provinces and the action of provincial
authorities, deemed to be la derogation of rights
secured by treaty to American fishermen. The
United States minister it London has been in
etructed to present a demand tor $105.305.0*2 in
view of the damages received bv American citi
zens at Fortune Bay on the 6th day of January,
ISiS. The subject has been taken into consider
ation by the British government, and an early re
ply is anticipated.
t pon the completion of the necessary prelim
inary examinations, the subject of oar participa
tion in the provincial fisheries, as regulated by
treaty, will at once be brought to the attention
of the British government with a view to an early
and permanent settlement of the whole question,
w hich was only temporarily adjusted by tne treaty
ol Washington.
Eflorts have been made to obtain the removal
of restrictions found injurious to the exportation
of cattle to the United Kingdom.
Some correspondence has also occurred with
regard to the rescue and saving of life and prop
erty upon the lakes, which has resulted in im
portant modifications of the previous regulations
of the Dominion government on the subject, in
tne interest of humanity and commerce.
In accordance with the joint resolution of the
last session of congress, commissioners were ap
pointed to represent the United States at the two
international exhibitions in Australia, one of
which is now in progress at Sydney, and the other
to be held next year at Melbourne. A dersire has
been expressed by our merchants and manufac
turers interested in the important and growing
trade with Australia, that an increased provision
should be made by congress for the representa
tion of our industries at the Melbourne exhibi
tion of next year, and the subject is respectfully
submitted to your favorable consideration.
the French cable.
The assent of the government has been given to
the landing, on the coast of Massachusetts, of a
new and independent transatlantic cable between
France, bv way of the French island of St. Pierre,
and this coantry.subjeet any future legislation of
coug. ess on the subject. The conditions imposed
before allowing this connection with our shores
to be established, are such as to secure its compe
tition with any existing or future lines of marine
cable, aud preclude amalgamation therewith, to
provide for entire equality of rights to our govern
ment and people with those of France in use of the
cable, and prevent any exclusive possession of the
privilege as accorded by France to the disadvan
tage of any future cable communication between
France and the United States which maybe pro
jected and accomplished by onr citizens. An ira-
IKjitant induction of the present rates of cable
communication with Europe, felt to be too burden
some to me interests of our commerce, roust nec
essarily flow- from the establishment of this com
peting line.
The attention of congress was drawn to the pro
priety of some general regulation bv congress of
Ihe whole subject of transmarine cables by my
predecessor iu his message of December 7th, ls7i
and I respectfully submit to your consideration
the importance of congressional action in this
matter.
OTHER FOREIGN MATTERS.
The question of grave Importance with Spate
growing out of the incidents of the Cubaninsur
rtoiion have oeen, for the most part, happily and
honorably settled. It may reasonatdy be antici
pated that the commission now sitting In Wash
ington. for the decision of private cases in this
connection, will soon be able to bring its labors to
a cone fusion.
The long standing question of East Florida
claims has lately been renewed as a subject if cor
respondence, and may possibly requite congres
sional action for Us final disposition.
A treaty with the Netherlands, with respect to
consular lights and privileges, similar to those
with other powers, has been signed and ratified,
and the ratifications were exchanged on the 31st
of July last. Negotiations for extradition treat

now in progress.
Some questions with Swinc-tiand, in -egard to
pauper and convict emigrants, have arisen, but it
is not doubted that they will be arranged upon a
just and satisfactory basis. A question kas also
occurred with respect to an asserted claim by
Swiss municipal authorities to exercise tutelage
over persons and property of Swiss citizens natur
alized in this country. It is possible thii mav re

With the Get...u empire frequent questions
arise in connection with ihe subjects o’ naturali

In consequence of the omission of cjngrese to

There is now no channel of diplomotic communi

Relations wi;h Austria, Russia, Ila.V. Portugal,

A change of the personal head of the govern
ment of Egypt has taken place. No thange, how
ever, has occurred iu the relations between Egypt
and the United Slates. The action of the Egyp
tian governments presenting to thocity of New
York one of the ancient obelisks, wnicti possess
such historic interest, is highly appicciated as a
generous mark ot International reganl. If pros
periiy should attend the enterprise of its trans
portation across the Atlantic, its erection in a
conspicious position in the chief coranercial city
of the nation will soon be accomplished.
The treaty recently made between Japan and
the United States iu regard to the revision of for
mer commercial treaties, it is now btlieved will
lie followed by similar action on the port of other
treaty powers. The attention of congress is again
invited to the subject of tho indemnity funds re
ceived some years since, from Japan ind China,
which, with their accumulated interest, now
amount to considerable sums. If any part of
these funds is justly due to Amcricm citizens
they should receive it promptly; and whatever
may have been received by this governneut in ex
cess of strictly just demands, should it. some form
be returned to the nations to whom U equitably
belongs.
The government of China lias signified its wil
lingness lo consider the question of tie emigration
of its subjects to the United States with a dispas--
sionaie fairness, and to co-operate in such meas
ures as may tend to prevent injurious consequenc
es to the United Stetes. The negotiations are still
proceeding, and will be pressed with dTigeuce.
A question having arisen between China and
Japan about the Lew s:!iev? Islands, the United
States government has taken measures to infotm
those powers of its readiness to extendits good of
fices for the maintenance of peace, if they shall
mutually deem it desirable, and find it practicable
to avail themselves of the proffer.
It is a gratification to be able to announce that,
through the judicious and energetic action of the
military commanders of the two nations on each
side of the Rio Grande, under the instructions of
their respective governments, raids and depreda
tions have greatly decreased, and, in tl.e localities
where formerly most destructive, have now almost
wholly ceased. In view of this result I entertain
a confident expectation that the prevalence of
quiet on tire border will soon become so assured as
to justify a modification of the presen; orders to
our military commanders as to crossing the bor
der, without encouraging such disturbances as
would endanger the peace of the two countries.
The third Instalment of the award against Mex
ico tinder the claims commission of July 4. 1868
was duly paid, and lias been put in course of dls
tributton in pursuance cf the act of congress pro
viding for the same. This satisfactory situation
’■etween the two countries leads me to anticipate
a expansion of our trade with Mexicoand an in
creased contribution of capital and industry hy
our people to the development of the great re
sources of that country. I earnestly commend to
the wisdom of congress the provision of suitable
legislation looking to this resqlt.
SOUTH AMERICAN STATIS.
Diplomatic intercourse with Colombia is again
fully restored by the arrival of a minister from
that counrry to the United States. This is espe
cially fortunate in view cf the fact that the ques
tion of an inter-oceanic canal has recently as
sumed anew and important aspect, and is now
under discussion with the Central American
countries through whose territory the canal, by
the Nicaragua route, would have to pass. It is
trusted that enlightened statesmanship ou
their part will see that the early prosecution ol
such a vork will largely enure to the benefit, not
only of their own citizens and those of the, T ;’\ u s‘J
taken under the protective auspices of the United
States, and upon satisfactory concessions for the
right of way, and its security, by the Central
/ merican governments, the capital for Us com
pletion w’suld bo readily furnished from this coun
try and Europe, which might, failing such guar
antees, prove inaccessible.
Diplomatic relations with Chili have also been
strengthened by the reception of a minister from
that country.
The war between Peru, Bolivia, and Chili, still
continues. The United States have not deemed
it proper to interpose in the matter, further than
to convey to all the governments concerned, the
assurance that the friendly offices ot the govern
ment of the United States for the restoration ol
peace upon an honorable basis will be extended,
in case the belligerents shall exhibit a readiness
to auccpt them.
Cordial relations continue with Brazil and the
Argentine Republic, and trade with those coun
tries is improving. A provision for regular and
more frequent mail communication, In our own
ships, between the ports of this country and the
nations of Sooth America seems to me to deserve
the attention cf congress, as au essential precur
sor of au enlargement of our commerce with
them, and an extension of our carrying trade.
A recent revolution in Veuzuela has been fol-
Itwed by the establishment of a provisional gov

A naval vessel has been sent to the Samoan

The subject of opening diulomatic relations

There is a gratifying increase of trade with
nearly all European and American countries, and
It is believed that with judicious action in regard
to its developemeut it can and will be still more
enhanced, and that American products and man
ufactures will And new and expanding markets.
The reports of diplomatic and consular officers
upon this subject, under the system now adopted,
have resulted m obtaining much valuable infor
mation, which has been and will continue to be
laid before congress and the. public from time to
time.
OUB AI.ASKA.
The third article of the ireaty with Russia, oi
March 30, 1667, by which Alaska was ceded to the
United Stales, provides that the inhabitants of
the ceded territory, with the exception of the un
civilized native tribes, shall be admitted to the
enjoyment of all the rights of citizens of the Unit
ed States, and shall be maintained and protected
in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property
and religion. The uncivilized tribes are subject
to such laws and regulations as the United States
may from time to time adopt in regard to the ab
original tribes of that country.
Beta the obligations of this treaty and the ne
cessities of the people, require that some organ
ized form of government over the territory of
Alaska be adopted.
There appears to be no law for the arrest of
persons charged with common-law offences, such
as assault, robbery, and murder, and no magis
trate authorized to issue or execute process In
such cases. Serious difficulties have already
arisen from offences of this character, not only
among the original inhabitants, bat among citi
zens of the United States and other countries,
who have engaged in mining, fishing, and other
business operations within the territory. A bill
authorizing the appointment of justices of the
peace and constables, and the arrest and deten
tion of persons chaiged with criminal offences,
and providing for an appeal to United States
couits for the district of Oregon, in suitable
esses, will, at a proper time, be submitted to
congress.
THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT.
The attention of congress is called to the an
nual report of the secretary of the treasury oq the
condition of the punlic finances.
The ordinary revenues from all sources for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1879, were $273,827,-
184.46; the ordinary expenditures for the same
period were $266,947,883 53; leaving a surplus
revenue for the year of $6,879,300.93.
The receipts for the present fiscal year, ending
June 30, 1860, actual and estimated, are as fol
lows: Actual receipts for the first quarter, com
mencing July 1, 1879, $79,843,663.61; estimated re
ceipts for the remaining three-quarters of the
year, $208,156,336.39; total receipts for the current
fiscal year, actual and estimated, $288,000,000.
The expenditures for the sane period will be,
actual and estimated, as follows: For the quar
ter commencing July 1, 1879, actual expendi
tures, $91,683 335.10; and for the remaining three
quarters of the year the expend ures are esti
mated at $172.310,614.90 —making the total ex
penditures $264,000,000, and leaving an estimated
surplus revenue for the year ending June3o,lßßo,
of 524,000,C(K). The total receipts during the next
fiscal year, ending June 33,1831, estimated ac
cording to existing laws, will be $288,000,000;
and the estimated ordinary expenditures for the
same period will be $278,097.364.39—1eaving a sur
plus of $9 902,635.61 fur that year.
The large amount expended for arrears of pen
sions du.ing the last and the present fiscal year,
amounting to $21,747,249 60, has prevented the ap
plication of the full amount required by law to
tlu einking fund for the current vtar; but these
arrears having been substantially paid, it is be
lieved that the sinking fund can hereafter be
maintained without any change of existing law.
THE WAB DEPARTMENT.
The secretary of war reports that the war de
paitment estimates lor the fiscal yearending June
30, 1881, are ;j40,380.428.93. the same being for a
less sum of money than any annual estimate ren
dered to congress from that department during
a period of at least twelve years.
He concurs with the general of the army in
recommending such legislation as will authorize
the enlistment of the full number of twenty-five
thousand men for the line of the army, exclusive
of the three thousand four hundred and sixty
ihree men required for detached duty, and there
fore not available for service In the field.
He also recommends that congress be asked to
provide by law for the disposition of a large num
ber of abandoned military postsand reservations,
which, though very valuable in tuemselves, have
been rendered useless for mllit-iry purposes by
the advance of civilization and settlement.
He unites with the quartermaster general in
tecommendlcg that an appropriation be made for
the construction of a cheap and perfectly fire
proof building for tbe safe storage of a vast
amount of money accounts, vouchers, claims and
other valuable records now in tho quartermaster
general’s office, and exposed to great risk of total
destruction by lira.
He a.so recommends, In conformity with the
views of the judge-acivocato general, some dec
laratory leiislat.on in reference to the military
salute of limitations as applied to the crime of
d-iertion.
In these several recommendations I concur.
Tho Secretary of War further reports, that the
work for tl*e improvement of the south pass of tho
Mississippi river, under contract with Mr. James
B. Eads, made iu pursuance of an act of congress,
has been prosecuted during the past year, with a
greater measure of success' in the attainment of
results than during any previous year. The
channel through the south pass, which, at the
beginning of operations in June, 1875, had a depth
of only seven and one-half feet of water, had, on
the Bth of July, 1879, a minimum depth of twenty,
six fset, having a width of not less than two hun
dred feet, and a central depth of thirty feet. Pay
ments have been made in accordance with the
statute, as the work progressed, amounting in the
aggregate to $4,230,000: and further payments
will become due, as provided by the statute, in
the event of maintaining the channel now se
cured.
ARMY CREMATIONS.
The report of the General of the Aimy and of
his subordinates, present a full and detailed ac
count ol the military operations for the suppres
sion of hostilities among the Indians of the Ute
and Apache tribes, and praise is justly awarded
to the officers and troops engaged, for promptness,
skill and courage displayed.
The past year has been one of almost unbroken
peace and quiet on the Mexican frontier, and there
is reason to believe that the efforts of this govern
ment and of Mexico, to maintain order in that re
gion, will prove permanently successful.
I'his department was enabled during the past
year to find temporary though crow’dcd accommo
dations, and a safe depository for a portion of its
records, in the completed east wins of the build
ing, designed for the stale, war and navy depart
ments. The construction of Ihe north wing of the
building, a part of the structure intended lor the
use of tiie war department, is being carried for
ward with all possible dispatch, and the work
thou;?, receive from congress such libeial appro
priations as will secure its speedy completion.
the navy department.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows
continued improvement in that brauch of the ser
vice during the last fiscal year. Extensive repairs
have been made upon vessels, and two new ships
have been completed and made ready for sea.
The total expenditures of trie year ended June
39, Ist ft, including specific appropriations not esti
mated for by the department, were $13,555,710.09.
The expenses chargeable to the year, after deduct
ing tile amount of these specific appropriations,
were $13,543,317.79; but tills is subject to a reduction
of $2H;i,725,99, that amount having been drawn upon
warrants, but not paid uu during the year. The
amount of appropriations applicable to the last
fiscal year was $14,538,646 17. There was, therefore,
a balance of sl,479,o‘>4.37remalningunexpende<t.ud
to the credit oj the department, ou June, 30. 1879.
The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 3d,
ISSI, are $14,864,147.95, which exceeds the appropri
ations for the present fiscal year $301,897.28. The
reason for this increase is explained in the secre
tary’s report. The appropriations available for
the present fiscal jear are $11,302,250.67, which will,
in the opinion of tint secretary, answer all the or
dinary demands of theserviee. The amount drawn
from the treasury from July i to ~ ,
a* $5.77(1,4114.12, of which $1,095,440.33 lias been re
funded, leuv ng the expenditure tor that period
$4,6i4,963,79. If tlie expenditures of the remaining
two-thirds of the year do not exceed the propor
tion for thesv four months, there will remain un
expended, at tire cud of the year, $477,358 30 of the
current appropriations. The report of the secre
tary shews tins gratifying fact that among all tl.e
disbursing officers of t ie pay corps of tne navy,
there is not one who is a defaulter to the extent of
a single dollar. I unite with him in recommend
ing the removal of the observatory to a more
healthful location. That institution reflects cred
it upon the nation, and has obtained the approba
tion (1 scientific men in all parts of the world.
Us removal from its present location would not
only be conducive to the health of its officers and
professors, but would greatly increase its useful
ness.
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
The appropriation for judicial expenses, which
has heretofore been made fertile department cf
justice, i gross, was subdivided at the last session
of congress, and no appropriation whatever was
made for the payment of the fees of marshals and
their depu! ies.cither in the service of proeessorfor
the discharge of other duties; and. since June 30
these officers have continued the performance of
their duties without compensation from the gov
ernment, taking upon themselves necessary inci
dental outlay s, as well as rendering their own ser
vices. In only a few unavoidable instances, has
the proper execution of the process of the United
States tailed by reason of the absence of the re
quisite appropriation, This course of official con
duct ou tiie part of tcesc officers, highly credita
ble to their fidelity, was advised by the ‘attorney
general, vvtio infoi med them, however, that they
would necessarily have to rely for their compensa
tion upon the prospect of mture legislation bv
congress. I therefore recommend that Immediate
appropriation be made by congress lor this pur
pose.
The act making the principal appro, Tiitloa for
the department of justice at previous sessions bus
uniformly contained the following clause: “And
for defraying the expenses walchmay be incurred
in the enforcement of the act approved February
23, 1870, entitled ‘An act to amend an act approved
May -30, 1870, entitled ‘An act to enforce the right
of citizens of the United States to vote In the sev
oral states in the United States, and for other
purposes,’ or any acts amendatory thereof or sup
plementary thereto,”
No appropriation was made for this purpose for
the current year. As no general election for mem
berg of congress occurred, the omission was a
matter of little practical importance. Such elec
tion will, however, take piace during the ensuing
year, and the appropriation made lor the pay of
marshals and deputies should be ■ vffictent to em
brace compensation 10r tne services"tHey may be
required to perform at such elections.
The business of the supreme court is, at pres
ent, largely m arrears. it sannotbe expected
that more causes can bo decided than are now
disposed of in its annual session, or that b/ any
assiduity the distinguished magistrates who com
pose the court can accomplish more than is now
done. In the courts cf many of the circuits, also,
the business has increa-etl to such an extent, that
the delay of jmtise will call the attention of con-,
gress to an appropriate remedy. It is believed
that all is done in each circuit which can fairly be
expected from its judicial force. The evils aris
ing from delay are less heavily felt by the United
State-s than by private suitors, as its causes are
advanced by ihc court when it is seen that they
involve the discussion of questions of a public
character.
Tha remedy nfge-ted by the attorney general,
is the appointment of additional circuit judges,
and the creation of an intermediate court of errors
and appeals, which shall relieve the supreme
court of a part of its jurisdiction, white a larger
force is also obtained fox the performance of cir
cuit duties.
I commend this suggestion to tI.C ‘ixifideratlon
of congress. It would seem toaiforu a complete
remedy, and would involve, if ten additional cir •
cuit judges are appointed, an expenditure, at the
bres nt rate of salaries, of iKrt more than sixty
thousand dollars a year, which would certaiuly be
small iu comparason with the objects to be at
tained.
THE POSTAL DEPAKTIIEXT.
The report of the postmaster general bears tes
timony to the general revival of business through
out the country. The leceipts of the post office de
partment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1879,
were $30,041’,82 88. being $76-j,46? 91 more than the
revenues of the preceding year. The amount re
alized from the sale of postage stamps, stamped
envelopes, and postal cards, was $784.48-5 91 more
than in the preceding j ear. and $2,387,559 23 more
than in 1817. The expenditures of the department
were $3 !.449.899 45. of which the sum of 1378 481 63
was paid on liabilities incurred in preceding
years.
Tne expenditures dating the ye.ir were s*oi,-
209 77 less than in the preceding year. This reduc
tion is to be attributed mainly to the operation of
the law passed J une 17,1878, changing the compen
sation of postmasters from a commission on the
value of stamps sold, to a commlssou en stamps
cancelled.
The amount drawn from the treasury on appro
priations in addition to the revenue s of'the depart
ment was $3,031,455 98, being *2,278,197 Si less thari
tn the preceding year
; The expenditures for the fiscal vear ending
dune 30, 1881. are estimated at $39,920,000, and the
receipts from all sources at $33,310 OW*. leaving a
deficiency to be appropriated lor, out ol the treas
ury. of |7,719,900.
The relations of the department with railroad
companies nave been harmonized, notwithstand
ing the general reduction by congress offthelr
compensafon, by the appropriation for special
facilities, and the railway post-office lines have
been greatly extended, especially in the southern
states. The Interests of tho railway mall service
and of the public would be greatly promoted, and
the expenditures eouid be more readily controlled
by the classification of the employes of the rail
way mall service as recommended by the post
master-general, the appropriation for salaries,
with respect to which the maximum limit is al
ready fixed by law. to be made In gross.
The postnuster general recommends an amend
ment of the law regulating the increase of com
pensation for increased service and increased
speed ou ttar routes, eo as to enable him to ad-
vertise for proposals ror snch Increased service
and speed. He also suggests the advantages to
accrue lo the commerce of the country front the
enactment of a general law authorizing contracts
with American-built steamer*, carryitig the
American flag, for transporting the mail between
ports of the United States and ports cf
the M est Indies and South America, at
a fixed maximum price per mile, the amount to
be expended being regulated hv annual appro
priations, iu like manner with the amount jad
for the domestic star service.
The arrangement made by the i ostm uter gen
eral and the secretary of the treasury tor tie col
lection of duty upon books received it the mail
from foreign countries, has proved so satisfactory
In its practical operation that the xecornsrendi
tion is now made, that congress shall extend the
pi^ v l? i< l” 3 01 the act of March 3. 1871, under
which this arrangement was made, so as to anntv
to ail other dutiable articles received in mails
Irom foreign countries.
tue interior department.
The reports of the secretary of tbe interior and
the commissioner of Indian affairs, setting
lorth the present su'e of our relations with the
Indian tribes on our territory .the measures taken
lo advance their civilization and prosperity, and
the progress already achieved by them, will be
lound of more than ordinary interest. The gen
eral conduct ol our Indian population has been
so satisfactory that the occurrence of two dis
turbances. which resulted in bloodshed and de
struction of property is all the more to be la
mented.
The history of the outbreak on the Whiie River
L te reservation in Western Colorado has become
88 lamiliar by elaborate reports in the public
press, that its remarkable incidents need not be
stated here in detail. It is expected that the
settlement of this difficulty will lead to such ar
rangements as will prevent further hostile con
tact between the Indians and the border settle
ments in Western Colorado.
The other disturbance occurred at the Mas
calero agency, in New Mexico, where Victoria,
the head of a small bund of maraudeis, after
committing many atrocities, being vigorously
chased by a military force made his way across
the Mexican border and is now on foreign soil.
While these occurrences, la which a compara
tively small number of Indians were engaged, are
most deplorable, a vast majority of our Indian
population have fully justified the expe/tations
of those who believe that by human and peaceful
influence the Indian can be led to aba/don the
habits of savage life and to develop ;/ capacity
for useful and civilized occupations. What they
have already accomplished in the pu/suit of ag
ricultural and mechanical work, the remarkable
success which has attended the experiment of
employing as freighters a class of l /dians hither
to counted among the wildest and moat intract
able, and the general and urgent desire expressed
by them for the education of their children, may
be taken as sufficient proof t'/at they will be
found capable of accomplishing much more if
they continue to be wisely and fairly guided.
The “Indian policy,” sketched in the report of the
secretary of the interior, the object of which is to
make liberal provision for the education of the
Indian youth, is to settle the Indians upon farm
lots in severalty, to give them title in fee lo their
farms, inalienable for a certain number of years,
and when their wants are thus provided for. to
dispose by sale of the lands on their reservations
not occupied and used by them, a fund to be
formed out of the proceeds for the benefit of the
Indians, which will gradually lelieve the govern
ment of the expenses now provided for by annual
appropriations, must commend itself as just and
beneficial to the Indians, and as also calculated
to remove those obstructions which the exist
ence of large reservations presents to the settle
ment and development of the country. 1 there
fore earnestly recommend the enactment of a law
enabling the government to give Indians a title
in fee, inalienable for twenty-five years, to the
farm-lands assigned to them by allotment. 1
also repeat the lecommendatiou made in my first
annual message, that a law be passed admitting
Indians who can give satisfactory proof of having,
by their own labor, supported their families for
a number of years, and who are willing to detach
themselves from their tribal relations, to the
benefit of the homestead act, and to grant them
patents containing tbe same provision of inalien
ability for a certain period.
Tbe experiment of sending a number of Indian
IM, (hI&XTo
ane 1 ementary English education and practical in
struction in farming and other useful industries,
lias led to results so promising, that it was thought
expedient to turn over the cavalry barracks at
Carlisle, iu Pennsylvania, to the interior depart
ment for the establishment of an Indian school
on a larger scale. The school lias now one hun
dred and fifty.eight pupils, selected from various
tribes, and is iu full operation. Arrangements
are also made for the education cf a number of
Indian boys and girls belonging to tribes on the
Pacific _ slope, in a similar manner, at Forest
Grove, in Oregon. These institutions will com
mend themselves to the liberality of congress, and
to the philanthropic munificence of the American
people.
INDIAN TERRITORY RAID.
•Last spring, information was received of the or
ganization of an extensive movement in the
western states, the object of which was the occu
pation by unauthorized persons of certain lands
in the Indian Territory ceded by the Cherokees to
the government for the purpose of settlement by
other Indian tribes.
On the Z9lh of April, I issued a proclamation
Warning all persons against participation in such
an attempt, and, by tne co-operation of a mili
tary force, the invasion was promptly checked.
It is ray purpose to protect the rights of the In
dian inhabitants of that territory to the full ex
tent of the executive power. But it would be
unwise to ignore the fact that a territory so large
and to textile, with a population so sparse and
with so great] a wealth of unused resources, will
be found more exposed to the repetition of such
attempts as happened this year, when the sur
rounding states are more densely settled, and the
westward movement of our population looks still
more eagerly for fresh lands to occupy. Under
such circumstances the difficulty of maintaining
the Indian territory in its present state will great
ly Increase, and the Indian tribes inhabiting It
would do well to prepare for such a contingency.
I. therefore, fully approve of the advice given to
them by the secretary of the interior on a recent
occasion, to divide among themselves in several
ty as large * quantity of their lands as they can
cultivate, to acquire individual title in foe, In
stead of their present tribal ownership in com
mon, and to consider in what manner tne balance
of their lands may be disposed of by the govern
ment for their benefit. By adopting such a policy
they would more certainly secure for themselvis
the value of their possessions, and at the same
time promote thei* progress in civilization r.d
prosperity, than by endeavoring to perpetuate
the present mate of things in the territory.
The question whether a change in the control
of the Indian service should be made, was in the
forty-fllth congress referred to a joint committee
of both houses for inquiry and report. In my
last annual message 1 expressed the hope that
the decision of that question, then in prospect,
“ would arrest further agittuion of this subject,
snch agitation being apt to croduce a disturbing
effect upon the service as well as the Indians
themselves.” Since then, the committee having
reported, the question has been decided in the
negative by a vole in the house of representa
tives.
For the reasons here stated, and in view of the
fact that further uncertainty on this point will be
calculated to obstruct other much-needed legis
lation, to weaken the discipline of the service,
and to unsettle salutary measures now in pro
gress for the government and improvement of
the Indians,.! respectfully recommend, that tho
decision arrlvecTaTby congress af its last session
be permitted to stand.
TIMBER TRESPASSER
The efforts made by the department of the In
terior to arrest the depredations oa the timber
lands of the United States have been continued,
and have met with considerable success. A large
number of cases of trespass have been pros
ecuted in the courts of the United States; others
have been settled, the trespassers offering to make
payment to tha government for the value of the
timber taken by them. The proceeds of these
prosecutions and settlements turned into the
treasury, far exceed in amount the sums appro
priated by congrass for this purpose. A more im
portant result, however, consists in the fact that
the destruction of our public forests by depreda
tion, although such cases still occur, has been
greatly reduced in extent, and it is probable that
if the present policy is vigorously pursued and
sufficient provision to that'end is made by con
gress, such trespasses-, at least those on a large
scale, can be entirely suppressed, except in the
territories where timber for the daily require
ments of the population cannot, under the pres
ent state of the law, be otherwise obtained. I
therefore earnestly invite the attention of con
gress to the recommendation made by the Secre
tary of the Interior, that a law be enacted enab
ling the government to sell timber from the pub
lic lands without conveying the fee, where snch
lands are principally valuable for the timber
thereon, such sales to be so regulated as to con
form to domestic wants and require
ments, while at the same time‘guarding against a
sweeping c.estruction of the forests. The' enact
ment of such a law appears to become a more
pressing necessity every day,
AGRICULTURE.
My iccommendations in former messages are
reaewed in favor of enlarging the facilities of the
department of agriculture. Agriculture is the
leading Interest and the permanent industry of
our people. It is to the abundance of agricul
tural production, as compared with our home
consumption, and the largely increased and
highly profitable market abroad which we have
enjoyed in recent years, that we are mainly lu
depted for our present prosperity as a people. We
must look for its continued maintenance to the
same substantial resource. There is no branch
of industry In which labor, directed by scientific
H. B. PHILLEO, Editor,
knowledge, yields such increased production in
comparison with unskilled labor, and no branch
of the public service to which the encouragement
of liberal appropriation? can be more appropri
ately extended. The omission to render such
aid is not a wise economy; but. on the contrary,
undoubtedly results in losses of immense snuis
annually that might be saved through well-direct
ed tflorta of the government to promote this
vital interest.
The results already accomplished with the very
limited means heretofore placed at tbe command
of the department of agriculture is an earnest of
what may be expected with increased appropria
tions for the several purposes indicated in the re
port of tho commissioner, with a view to placing
the department upon a footing which will enable
it to prosecute more effectively the objects for
which it is established.
, Appropriations are needed for a more complete
labratory for the establishment ot a veterinary
division, and a division of forestrv, and for an in
crease of force.
The requirements for these and other purposes,
indicated in the report of the commissioner un
der the head of the immediate necessities of the
department, will not involve any expeudlltre of
money that the country cannot with propriety
now undertake in the intucsts of agricnltute.
EDUCATION.
It is gratifying to learn from the human of edu
cation the extent to which educational privileges
throughout the United States have been advanced
during the year. No more fundamental re
sponsibility rests upon congress than that of
devising appropriate measures of financial
aid to education, suplemeutal to local action in
the states and territories, and in the District of
Columbia The wise forethought of the founders
to our government has only furnished the
basis for the support of the common school sys
tems of the newer states, but laid the foundations
for the maintenance of their universitias and co*
leges of agriculture and mechanic arts. Meas
ures in accordance with this traditional policy for
the further benefit of all these interest-, and the
extension of the same advantages to every por
tion of the country, it is hoped, will receive
favorable consideration.
PUBLIC LIBRARY.
To preserve and perpetuate the national litera
ture should be among the foremost cares of the
national legislature. The library gathered atth’
captiol still remains unprovided with any suitable"
accommodations for its rapidly increasing stores.
The magnitude and importance of the collection,
increased as it is by the deposits made under the
law of copyright, by domestic and foreign ex
changes, and by the scientific library ot the
Smithsonian Institution, call for building accom
modations w hich shall be at once adequate and
fire-proof. The location of such a public build
ing, which should provide for the pressing neces
sities of the present, and for the vast increase of
the nation’s books in the future, is a matter w hich
addresses itself to the discretion of congress. It
is earnestly recommended as a measure which
should unite all suffrages, and which should no
longer be delayed.
WASHINGTON MONUMENT.
The joint commission created by the act of con
gress of August li, ls"b, for the purpose of super
vising and directing the completion of the Wash
ington national monument, of which commission
tlie president is a member, has given careful at
tention to this subject, and already the strength
ening of the foundation has so far progressed as
to ensure the entire success of this part of the
work. A massive layer of masonry has been in
troduced belov? the original foundation, widening
the base, increasing the stability of the structure,
and rendering it possible to carry the shaft to
completion. It is earnestly recommended that
sucli further appropriations lie made for the con
tinued prosecution of the work as may bo neces
sary for the completion of this national monu
ment at an early day.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
In former messages, impressed with the im
portance of the subject, I have taken occasion to
commend to congress the adoption of a generous
policy towards the District of Columbia. The
report of the commissioners of the District,
herewith transmitted, contains suggestions and
recommendations, to ail of which I earnestly in
vite your careful attention. I ask your early and
favorable consideration of the views which they
express as to the urgent need of legislation fur
the reclamation of tbe marahes of the Potomac
and its eastern branch, within the limits of the
city, and for the repair of the streets of the capi
tal. heretofore laid with wooden blocks, and now
by decay rendered almost impaseaoie. ana a
source of imminent danger to the health of its
citizens. The means at the disposal of the com
missioners are wholly inadequate for the accom
plishment cf these important works, and should
be supplemented by timely appropriations from
the federal treasury.
Tie filling of the’flats in front of the city will
add to the adjacent lands and parks now owned
by the United States, a large and valuable do
main, sufficient, It is thought, to reimburse it*
entite cost, and will also, as an incidental result,
secure the permanent improvement of the river
for the purpose of navigation.
The constitution having invested congress with
supreme and exclusive jurisdiction over the
District of Columbia, its citizensjmustof necessity
look to congress alone for all needful legislation
affecting their.interest; and as tbe territory of this
district is the common property of the people of the
United Stales, who equally with its resident
citizens, are interested in the prosperity of their
capital, I cannot doubt that you will be amply
sustained by the general voice of the country lu
any measures yon may adopt for this purpose.
I also invite the favorable consideration of con
gress to the wants of the public schools of this
district, as exhibited in tbe report of the commis
sioners. While the number of’pupils is rapidly
increasing, no adequate provision exist* for a
corresponding increase of school accommodation,
and the commissioners Ere without tbe mean*
to meet this urgent need A number of the build
ings now need for school purposes are rented,
and are. in important particulars, ansuited for
the purpose. The cauie of popular education iu
‘.he District of Columbia is smcly entitled to Oi
same consideration at the bunds of the national
government as in the several state? and terri
tories, to which munificent grants of the public
lands have been made for the endowment of
rcbools aud universities.
RUTHERFORD B. HIYE9.
Executive Mansion, December 1, 1879.
Crazed by a Hallway Disaster.
Jackson (Mich.) Patriot.
Colwell, the ex-yard master, through
whose mismanagement the great acci
dent resulted, on Fridayappeared in the
yard at the junction in a s'ate of nervous
excitement, and in a hurried and insane
way began to open and close switches, at
the same time yelling to the yardmen
to hasten the trains out of the way as
the express was coming. He finally
seemed to imagine that a collision had
occurred, and cried: “ There they lie!
Don’t you see those dead women ?"
Officer M. H. Rowman was sent for, but
before he arrived Colwell was taken to
his home.
On the occasion of the recent visit to
this city of N. D. Root, train dispatcher
at Michigan City, with whom Colwell is
acquainted, the latter assured him that
s nee the terrible disaster he was unable
to get any refreshing sleep. He said the
instant he lost consciousness he could
hear the noise of railroad trains; then
they would burst upon his sight as they
sped madly towards each other; the sig
nal of whistles fur switch and brake
would next startle him. and instantly,
with a terrib'e crash, the locomotives
would strike, when he would awaken in
a tremor of fright.
