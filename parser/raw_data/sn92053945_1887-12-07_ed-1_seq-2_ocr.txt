The MrHMaee.
If the Fiftieth congress fail" to adopt
measures looking lo a speedy and Keneral
reduction of the Dresetit iniquitious tariff,
the blame for inaction will full on that
body ""I on President Cbvdand,
who takes a bold and decisive stunii f..r
revenue reform. In fact bis meaaake
treata aolely of that all-important ques
tionthe tariff and he bindles it with
out gloves. There is no meaningless
nonsense about it, an1 he states his posi
t on and the urgency of a reduction in
import duty in plain, but forcible Eng
lish. The president's message i different
from the ordinary cliar icter nf such dix-ii
m'enta in the pat. Instead of the custo
mary recapitulation and n-liah of ri-pnria
of cabinet offt.-ers, and cnn-iraiulatory
mention of our amicable relations with
foreign natinns ate.i ceneral pros
perity, Mr. t'levelaml devotes hiin-ell
entirely to the reconstruction f the tariff.
And the president very wisely suggests no
Interference with the wbi-ky and tobacco
tax, hut wi.uld matte the reduction on th.'
necessaries of life and riw materials.
While the message is a scholarly eff.irt,
and shows much study and preparation, it
defines the position and reflects the sentl
ment of the democr tic p trtv on tuis
great question. More than ever befon
the democracy should lie proud "f U rover
Cleveland, and whatever diuhiingTitom
ses there wore that the president was
not in sympathy with his party on the
tiriff QuealioD. should now lie iivtc than
ttia&ed.
Mirnrk the I'opular Taste.
So Diuclt siicccmh nod general public
satisfaction has altcmled the establish
meot of a market for Armour fe Com
pany's fresh inspected meats in Rock Is!
and in the marling of the ehop of
F. E. Woods tfc Co., on Second avenue,
near Twentieth street, that anotbt-r shop
hna been eatabUtihed farther duwo town
.-at the corner of Third avenue aod
Ninth Ktreet Woodin & Hill being pro
prietors, and their object is to sell Ar
mour's meats at the greatly reduced
prices heretofore published. The new
firm will carry the freshest meals lrm
Armour & Co. 'a Kansas City packing
house, and what they Hell will he guarani
teed. o this sul jeel of reduction in
the price of taeat, a local correspondent
of the Peoria Journal writes his paper:
Peorians and others who are growling
about the high price of meat had belter
come up this way tor awhile, where they
can purchase steaks, r justs, etc , at bed
rock. Some time since I sfoke about the
futile attempt of Phil Armour to sell meat
to the butchers in this city, Moline and
Davenport, and his threat to go into bus
iness on his own hook, on exteusive plans.
He has carried his threat into execution.
A large market has been opened up
In each of the tri -cities, and the
bottom has been knocked clear
out of things. Armour received his brut
installment of meat on Thursday and
quotes teaks ten cents pr pound and
roasts Ave cents. But he is not to have
everything hia own way. Two of the
local dealers have already cut clear below
him and announce Bteaks three pounds
for a quarter, roasts seven cents and noil
ing pieces three to six cents. Thus has
the war been inaugurated in earnest and
Armour is doing a big business. It is
eaBV to predict the outcome. The butch
era have either got to buy Armour's meat
or go out of the business. They cannot
afford to buck him. He has a "sinch"
on things so to speak. Helling so much
meal as be does, he can afford to do it at
much less rates than local dealers who
have only their short ranee of customers
to depend on. Consumers re jubilant
and hope the war will wrix hotter and
keep right on.
The Overlap t'lyerw.
The new fast train which is to he pu
on the O.. H. I. & P. for the west will be
a midnight train in Rock Island. It will
leave Chicago at 7:3U p m. and arrives in
Rock Island at 11.35. In Davenport the
Kansas City coaches will form soother
train and off the two trains will fly, one
for the southwest and the other for the
west one for the Southern Pacific and
the other for the Union Pacific. The
main line train will arrive in Omaha at 11
ft. m. next day, and in Kansas City at
1140, making close connections at both
places with trains for San Francisco.
The Union Pacific will arrive at Ogdert
the second day, and the Central Pacific
at San Francisco the third day.
The running time hetween Chicago
and the Mississippi wilt tie four hours, 15
minutes, and the Mississippi to the Mis.

today to make final arrangements. The
new time table will cot go into effect
until Sunday, lHlh inst.
The Bishop' llotrsr.
The contractors are getting fairly to
work on the house uf Bishop Spaulding
in Peoria. The Journal of that city says
the house is to stand on the lot adjoining
the new cathedral and facing Madison
street. There is a large house there now,
hut the porch and side buildings have
been torn away and only the central sec
lion will remain and be utilized. To this
will be added ft front 35x44$ feet, built of
the beat Anamosa stone to match the
cathedral and faced with polished gran,
ite. The older structure is relegated to
the rear of the lot, but it also will be
faced with stone and made very present
able. The entire building, when com
pleted, will form a handsome and highly
commodious clergy house. It will con
tain ample offices, reception and dining
rooms, ft library, studies, sitting rooms,
nd ft comfortable suite of sleeping apart
menu on the third floor. The clergy of
the cathedral chapter together with the
bishop will find all the conveniences lack
ing in the present residence.
A Beauty.
Frank Bleuer, of Bleuer's band and or

the celebrated brass instrument manufao
turer pf Philadelphia, a beautiful B flat
brass cornet, heavily plated with silver
and gold and richly engraved. It is a
beautiful instrument, being provided with
all the attachments for orchestra music.
With such an instrument in his band Mr.
Bleuer ought to be able to produce more
delightful music than ever.

Washington Citt, Deo. 7. The president's
message, the text of which is glvea below, was
eat to oongresi and read to the two house -Tuesday.
It pnoawnta the unique feature of be
ing devoted entirely to the "State of the Union"
eonfddertxl with reference to the surplus in the
treasury and the oiieriitiomt ol the present tariff
lawa, aud an earnest argument to establish tbf
proposition that a revision of those laws provid
ing a reduction of customs duties aud thereby
the prevention of the surplus is the pressing sub
ject for legislation at this time.
TO THE CONOKBMS OF THE UNITED STATES:
You are confronted at the threnhhoid of your
legislative duties with a conditiou of the nv
tunal flaauoes which imperatively demands
immediate and careful consideration. Tim
ainoani of money annnalty received through the
operation of present laws, from the industries
aud necessities of the people, largely exceeds
tli sum necessary to meet the expenses of the
government. When we consider that the theory
of our institutions tfuarantees to every citizen
the full endowment of the fruits of his industry
and enterprises, with only such deduction as
may be bis share toward the careful and eco
Doaiieal maintenance of Uie government which
protects htm. it is plain that the exaction of
more titan this Is Indefensible and a culpable
ttetrayai of fairness and justice. This wrung in
flicted upon those who bear the burden of na
tional taxation, like other wrongs, multiplies a
brood of evil coil sequences. The public treas
ury, which should only exist as a conduit con-
veying the people's tribute to its legitimate ob
jects of expenditure, becomes a boarding place
for money ueediessly withdrawn from trade and
the people's nse, thus eripplituj our national en-
styles, tisuii1Qg nr country b development, pre
venting vestment In productive enterprises.
threatening nuam-ial disturbance, and inviting
scnemes or panne piunaer.
Th it conditinn of our treasury Is not altogether
new ; snd it has more than once of late been sub
mitted to the people's representatives in con
gress, who alone can appiy a remedy. And yet
the situation still continues, with aggravated in
cidents, mitre than ever presaging fiuaucial con
vulsions and wide-spread disaster. It will not
do to neglect this situation because its dangers
are not now palpably imminent and apparent.
They exist none the less certainly and the uuf ore-
seen ana unexpecteu occasion may oomewnen
suddenly they will be preolpitated upon us.
no uie sow aay oi une, i, ine excess oi
revenue over miblic exiteuditnre after eoinilvins
with the annual requirement of the sinking-fund
act, was 17,tV.t.7:i5.Hi; during the year ended
June Jtu, It;, puch excess amounted to ?4).5,-
M5.tai;and during the vear ended June 3u, !..
It reached the sum of fc5.5c7.si9 M. Tlie annual
coutriuutfoae to the Binking-fund during the
three years above specified, amounting In the
aggregate to piw,ij,jai.!, ana deducting rrom
the surplus as Btated, were made by calling in for
that purpose outstanding 3 per cent bonds
of the government. During the six mouths prior
to June JU, im.tue surplus revenue had grown
so large by repeated accumulations, and it was
ieared toe witnarawni ox this great sum of money
needed uy tne people, would so ant the busi
ness of the country that the sum of
7J.8m,h of such surplns was applied to the
payment of the principal and interest of the
3 per cent, Domts stin outstanding, aim which
were then pa?abe at the option of the eoveru-
ment. The precarious condition of financial af
fairs amoug we people eiiii needed reiiei. imme
diately after the 8"th dav of June. l(i7. tho re
mainder of the 3 per cent, bonds thus outstand
ing amounting, witn principal ana interest, to
the sum of la.flf77.au, were called in and ap
plied to the sinking fund contribution for the
current fiscal year. Notwithstanding these oper
ations of the treasurr department, representa
tions of distress in busiuesn circles not onlv con
tinued but Increased, aud absolute peril seemed
at band lu these circumstances the contribu
tion to the sinkine fund for the current fiscal
vear was at once completed bv the expenditure
of 27,tM,2fi.M in the purchase of government
bonds not yet due bearing 4 and 4W per cent in
terest, the premium paid thereon averaging about
M per cent, for the former and ft per ceL.L for the
latter. In addition to this the interest accruing
during the current year npon the outstanding
bonded indebtedness of the government was to
some extent anticipated and banks selected as
depositories of public money were permitted to
somewhat increase their deposits.
While the expedients thus employed, to re
lease to the people the money lying in the treas
ury, served to avert immediate danger, our sur
plns revenues have continued to accumulate, ttie
excess for the present vear amounttnc on the lut
day of I ecember to S.'5.'26H,71.1u,and estimated to
reach the stun of Sna.uuu.uuu ou the 3uthofJune
next, at which date it is expected that this sum, !
added to prior accumulations, will swell the but- 1
plus in the treasury to il4G,uOu.4)Ou.
There seems te be no assurance that with each
a withdrawal from use of the people's circulat
ing medium nnr business community may not in
the near future be subjected to the same distress
which was quite lately produced from the same
cause. And while the functions of our national :
treasury should be few and simple, and while j
the best condition would be reached, I believe.by i
Its entire disconnection with the private business
interests, yet when, by a perversion of its pur-
Kwea, it idly holds money uselessly substracted
nm the channels of trade, there seems to be rea
sons for the claims that legitimate means should
be devised by the government to renters in an
emergency, without waste or extravagance, such
money to Its place among the people.
If such an emergency arises tli ere now exists
no clear and undoubted executive power of re
lief. Heretofore the redemption of the 3 per
cents only, which were payable at the option of
the government, has afforded a means for the
disbursement of the excess of our re venues ; but
these bonds have all been retired, and there are
bo bonds outstanding, the payment of which we
have the right to insist upon. The contribution
to the sinking fund, which furnishes the occa
sion for expenditures in the purchase of bonds,
has been already made for the eurreut year, so
there is no outlet in that direction.
! the present state of legislation the only
pretense of any existi ng executive power to re
store, at this time, any part of our surplus reve
nues to the people by its expenditure, consists
tn the supposition that the secretary of the
treasury may-enter the market aud purchase the
bonds of the government not yet due, at a rate
of premium to be agreed upon.
The only provision of law from which such a
power could be derived is found in an ap
propriation bill passed a number of years ago,
and it is subject to the supposition that it was
Intended as temporary and limited in its ap
plication Instead of con (erring a continuing dis
cretion and authority. No condition ought to
exist which would Justify the grant of power to
a single official upon hiB jtidgmentof its necessi
ty, to withhold frum or release to the business of
the people Id an unusual manner money held in
the treasury, and thae affect, at his will, the
financial situation of the country ; and If It is
deemed wise to lodge m the secretary of the
treasury the authority in the present juncture to
purchase bonds, it should be plainly vested, and
provided as far as possible with such checks
and limitations as will define his official right
and discretion, and at the same time relieve hi'Ji
from undue responsibility,
la considering the question of purchasing
bonds ae a means of restoring to circulation the
surplus money accumulating in thetreaai. y, It
should be borne in mind that premiums must
of course be paid upon such purchase ; that there
may be a large part of these bonds held as in
vestments which can not be purchased at any
price and that combinations among holders who
are willing to sen, may unreasouaoiy annance
the cost of such bonds to the government.
It has been suggested that the present bonded
debt might be refunded at a less rate of interest
and the difference between the old and new se
curities paid in eaah, thus finding use for the
surplus in the treasury. The success of this
plan, it is apparent, must be founded upon the
volition oi uie noioero oi uie present douus; ana
It Is not entirely certain that the inducement
which must be offered them would result in
more financial benefit to the government
than the pu rohase of bonds , w hi le the
proposition would reduce the prin
cipal of the debt by actual payment, instead
f extending It. The proposition to deposit the
money held or Uie government in banks
throughout the eountry, lor use by the people.
n, it seems to me, an exceedingly objectionable
principle as reaching too close a relationship be
tween the operations of the government to the
business of the country, and too extensive a com
mingling of their money, thus fostering an on
natural reliance In private business upon public
funds. If this scheme should be adopted it
should be done as a temporary expedient to meet
an urgent necessity. Legislative and executive
effort should generally be In the opposite direc
tion and should have a tendency to divorce, as
much and as fast as can be dona the treasury
department from private enterprises. Of coure
it is not extected ttiat unnecessary and extrava
gant appropriations will be made for
the purpose of avoiding the accumula
tion of an excess of revenue. Huch
expenditure, besides the demoralization of
all just conceptions of public duty which it en
tails, emulates a reckless improvideace not in
the least consistent with the mission of our peo
ple or the high aad beneficent purposes ol our
government.
I have deemed It my duty thus to bring to the
knowledge of my countrymen, as well as the
attention of their representatives to the respon
sibility of legislative relief, the gravity of our
financial situation. The failure of the congress
heretofore to provide against the danger which
it was quite evident the very nature of the dif
ficulty must necessarily produce, caused a condi
tion of financial distress and apprehension since
their last adjournment which taxed to the at
most all the authority aad expedients within ex
ecutive control ; and these appear now to lie ex
hausted. If disaster results from the continued
inaction of congress the responsibility must rest
where it belongs.
The sttnation thus far Is fraught with danger
which should be fully realized, and though it
presents features of wroug to the people as well
as to the country. It is but a result growing out
of a perfectly palpable and apparent cause con
stantly reproducing toe same alarming circum-staawes-
a congested national treasury and a de
pleted monetary condition iu the business of the
country. It need hardly be stated that while the
present situaUota demands a remedy we can only
be saved from a like uredicameut in the future by
the removal of the cause.
Onr scheme of taxation by means of which this
Deedleas surplus la taken from the people and
put into the public treasury consists of a tariff
or duty levied upon importations from abroad
and internal revenue taxes levied npon the con
sumption of tobaooo and spirituous and malt
liquors. It moat be considered that none of these
taxes relatlQg to things subjected to internal rev
nue taxation are, strictly speaking, necessary ;
and it also atneara anhnno iunt cuiiiu nf omn.
plaint of the ooimameTS of the articles, and there
e to be nothing so well able to bear toe
burden without hards hip to any portion of the
Tint our present tan it laws, the various, in
equitable and illegal source of unnecessary tax
Mion, ought to be atonce revised and amended.
These laws.as their primary andplam effect,raise
the price to consumers of ail articles imported
and subject to duty, by precisely the sum paid tor
Bucb duties. Thus' the amount of the duty meas
ure's the tax paid by those who purchase for use
these imported articles. Many of these things,
however, are raised or manufactured in onr own
country, and the duties now levied upon foreign
goods and product are called protection to these
home manufactures, because they render it pos
sible for those of our people who are manufact
urers to make these taxed articles and sell them
tor a price equal to that demanded for the im
ported goods that have paid customs doty. Bo it
happens that while comparatively a
few nse the imported articles,
mi'.lions of onr people, who never use and never
saw auy of the torcifm products, purchase and
use things of the same kind msxle in tins coun
try, and pay therefor Jieariy or quite the same
enhanced price which the dutv adds to the im
ported articles. Those who buy imports pay
the dntv chareM thfreon into the public treas
ury, but the groat majority of our citizens who
buy domestic atttclea of the same clans pay a
sum at least appio&tuiateiy enual to t) is duty to
the home manufacturers. This refer nee to the
operation of our tar HI laws is not meue by way
of lustructlou, but in order that we may oe oon
Blaotly reminded of the manner in which they
imponea burden npon those who consume do
mestic products as Willi as those who consume
imported articles, aud thus create a tax upon ail
our people.
it is not proposed to entirely relieve me coun
try of this taxation. It uinatne extensively cjH-
tiuned as the source of the government's income;
aud in a reattjatitiuent of our tariff the interesta
of American labor engaged iu manufacture
should be carefully considered, as well as Uie
pr servatioo in our manuiactares. it may ue
called protection, or by any other name, butro-
iei rr. lit the hurusmpri aud uHugers or our pres-
tariff laws shu;d be devised with especial
pre an lion agaiust imperiling the existence of
our .nauirlat-turiuK interests. But this existence
sh uld in t mt-an a condition which, without re
.ttoi to tliti public welfare or a national exigency.
must alwavs insure tire realization or tniiuenee
profits inhtV ad of moderately profitable returns.
As the volume and diversity of our national ac
tivities increase new recruits are added to those
who desire a continuation of the advantages
which thty conceive Uie present system of
tariff taxation directly affords them. So titub-
bomly have all efforts to reform Uie present con
dition been rfisttl by tbogt ot our fellow-citi-cens
thus engaged, that they can hardly com
plain of the stibpicion, entertained to a certain
extent, tiutt there tist an orgauiwd combiua-
tion ail along- the line to maintain their advan
tage.
We are iu the midst of eentonntal celebrations.
and with becoming pride we rejoice iu American
skill aud ingenuity, in American energy and en
terprise, and in the wonderful natural advan
tages and resources developed by a century's
national growth. Vet when an attempt is made
to justify a scheme which permits a tax to be
laid upon every duuiiier in thf land for the ben
entUofour luantifacturers quite bevond a rea
sonable demand for governmental regard, it suits
the pti r ofiH of the manufacturers and infant
industries still neediug the highetit aud greatest
degree ol favor and care lhnt can be wrung from
federal legislation. It is also said that the in
crease in the price of domestic m'tnttfactui'ed
resulting rrotn nie preseDttarm is necessary iu or

acknowledge t he lore of an argument which in

Uie eyes of every AmetKnn citizen, aud lies at
the foundHtiou of our development ; it is entitled

not lie measured bvthutof another country lews

to the manufacturer after a necessary readjust
ment should furojil. no eicuse for tile sacrifice
of the interests ot bif employers in either thair

factures fail to understand tbt while a
high tariff is claimed to bfc necessary
to allow payment of remunerative wages,
it certainly " results in a very large in
crease in the price of nearly all sorts of
man u facto res. which, in almost countless forms,
he needs for the use of hiinseii aud his fniiuiv.
He receives at the desk ot his employer his

article wmcti t mnraces nts own laoor to return
in Uie payment of the increasing price which
Uie tann permits, uie tiam-eaiut-u compensation
of many days of toil.

price which the tenff Imposes nin every agri

all he utesaud owns, except the increase of his

bandry produce!- from the soil, is invited to aid
in niaiuraniiNC th-present situation , miuil, he is
told that a hli duty ou imported wool in neces
sary for th o ii m 'f those who have sheep to
shear, iu order that the price of their wool may
ne increased, i u- oi course are not reminded
that uie farmer ho has no sheep Is by this
scheme obliged, in his pur bases of clothmc and
woolen goods, b ptiya tribute to his iellow
farmera well h to tne manufacturer aud mer
chant: sor ia nn mention made of the fact that
the sheep owners themse:vM aud their house
holds must wetr f'othinc and use ouier articles
manufatarod from the wool they sell at tariff
prices, aud thus h cous timers, must return their
share of this mcn-ased price to Uie tradesman I
think it may tie fairly aesumed that a large pro
portion of 'the sheep owned by Uie farmers
Uirougbout the- country are found iu small Hocks
numbering from twenty-five to fifty.
Th duty on the grade of im
ported wool which Uiese Rheep yield is 10 cents
on each iound if ot the value at cents or less,
and ill cents if of the value of more than 30 cents.
If Uie liberal eetimate ot Nix pounds be allowed
for each fleece, the duty thereon would be (10 or
72 cents, and thin may be taken as Uie utmost en
hancement of its prim to the fanner by reason
of this duty, ttumteen dollars would thus repre
sent the increased price of the wool from twentv
flve sheep and $. that from the wool of titty
sheep ; and at present values this addition would
amount to altout one-third of its price. If upon
its sale Uie farmer receives this or a less tariff
profit, the wool leaves his hands charged with
precisely that sum, which hi all its chances will
adhere to it, until it reaches the consumer.
When manuiactureu into cloth and oUier g ioda
and material for use, its cost is not only increased
to the extent ot the farmers' tariff profit, but a
further sum has Iteen added for the benefit of the
manufacturer under Uie operation of other tariff
laws.
In Uie meantime the day arrives when the
farmer finds it necessary to purchase woolen
goods and material to clothe himself and family
iot uie winter, vtnen ne iaces tne tradesman
for that pm-jHwe, he discovers that he is obliged
not only to return in the way of increased prices.
hia tariff profit on the wool he sold, and which
then perhaps lies lefore him in manufactured
form, but that he must add a considerable sum
thereto to meet a further increase in cost caused
by a tariff duty on Uie manufacture. Thus in
Uie end, he is aroused to the fact that he has
paid upon a moderate purchase, ae a result of
Uie tariff scheme which, when he sold his wool,
seemed so profitable, an increase tn price more
than sufficient to sweep away all uie tariff profit
he received upon Uie wool he produced and
sold.
When Uie number of farmers encaged in wool
raising is compared with all the farmers tn Uie
country, and Uie email proiortion they bear to
our population in considered ; v. hen it is made
apparent that, in the cane of a large part of those
who own sheep. Uie benefit of Uie present tariff
on wool is illusory ; and, alKrve all, when it must
be conceded that Uie increase of Uie cost of liv
ing caused by such tariff, becomes a burden upon
Uiose with moderate means, and the poor, the
employe'1 and the unemployed, the sick and
well, and the young and old. and that it consti
tutes a tax which, with relentless grasp, is fast
ened upon the clothing of every man, women,
and child in the land, reasons are suggested whv
Uie removal or reduction of this duty should be
Included in a revision of our tariff laws.
In speaking of Uie increased cost to the con
sumer of our home manufactures resulting from
a duty laid upon imported articles of the same
description, the fact is not overlooked that com
petition among our domestic producers some
times has Uie effect of keeping Uie price of their
products below the highest limit allowed by such
duty. Hut it Is notorious that this competition
is too often strangled by combinations quite pre
valent at this time, and frequently called trusts,
which have for their object Uie regulation of Uie
supply and price of commodities made and sold
bv members of the combination. The people
can hardly hope for auv consideration in the
operation of these selfish schemes. If, how
ever, in the alisence of such combination, a
healthy and free competition reduce the price
of any particular dutiable article nf home pro
duction beiow Uie limit which it muiht otherwise
reach under our tariff laws, and it, with such re
duced price, its manufacture continues to thrive,
it is entirely evident that one thing has )een
discovered which should be carefully scrutinized
In an effort to reduce toxatiou. The nt .-easily of
combination to maintain uie price of any com
modity to Uie tariff point furnishes proof that
someone la willing to accept lower prices for
such commodity, and that such prices are re
munerative; and later prices produced by com
petition prove the same thing. Thus where
either of these conditions exist, a case would
Beem to be presented tut an early reduction of
taxation.
The considerations which have been presented
touching our tariff laws are intended ouly to en
force an earnest recommendation that the sur
plus revenues of tiie government be prevented by
the reduction of our customs duties, and, at uie
same time, to emphasize a suggestion that in ac
complishing this purpose, we niay discharge a
double duty to our people bv granting to them a
measure of relief from tariff tnxreion in quarters
where it is most needed and from sources where
it can be most fairly and justly accorded, hot
can the presentation made of such consideration
be, with anv degree of fairness, regarded aa evi
dence of unfriendliness toward our manufactur
ing interests, or of any lack of appreciation of
their value and Importance. These Interests
constitute a leading aud most su)stantial ele
ment ot onr national greatness and furnish the
proud proof of our country s progress. But if in
the emergency ttiat presses upon us our manu
facturers are asked to surrender something for
the public good and to avert disaster, their patri
otism, as well as a grateful recognition of ad
vantages already afforded, should lead them to
willing co-operation. No demand is made that
they shall forego all Uie beouhtx of governmental
regard; but they cannot fail to be admon
ished of their duty, aa well as their enlightened
self-interest and safety, when they ae reminded
otiie fc$ ftnfinTtHfll peni- and troll arts, w
bJch the present condition tends, afford" rfb
greater shelter or protection to our manufactures
than to onr other important enterprises. Oppor
tunity for Bare, careful and deliberate reform is
now offered ; and none of us shouid be unmind
ful of a time when an abused and irritated people,
heedless of those who have resisted timely and
reasonable relief, may insist npon a radical and
sweeping rectification of their wrongs.
The difficulty attending a wiae and fair revis
ion of our tariff laws is not Under-estimated.
It will require on the part of congress great labor
and care, and especially a broad and national
contemplation of uie subject, and a patriotic dis
regard of such local and selfish claims as are un
reasonable and reckless of tne welfare of the en
tire country.
Under our present laws more than 4,000 artielta
are subject to duty. Many of these do not 'n any
way compete with our own manufacture, and
uiauy are hardly worth attention as subjects of
revenue. A considerable reducuou can be mad
m the aggregate by adding them to the free UlL
The taxation of luxuries presents no features of
hardship ; but the necessaries of life used "and
consumed by all Uie people, the duty npon which
adds to Uie cost of living in every home, should
be greatly cheapened. The radical reduction of
the duties imposed upon raw material used in
manufactures, or its free importation, is, ot
course, an important factor in any effort to re
duce the price of these necessaries ; it would not
only relieve them from Uie increased cost caused
by the tariff on such material, bet Uie manufact
ured product beiug thus cheapened that part ot
Uie tariff now laid upon such product, as a com
pensation to our manufacturers for the present
price of raw material, could be accordingly mod
ified. Such reduction, or free importation, would
serve besides to largely reduce the
revenue. It is not apparent how
such a change can have any injurious
effect upon our manufacturers. On the contrary,
it would appear to give them a better chance in
freicn markets with Uie manufacturers of other
countries who cheapen their wares by free ma
terial. Thus our people might have
the opportunity of extending thtir sales
beyond the limits of home consump
tion, saving titem from the depression,
interruption in business aud los caused by a
glutted domestic market, and affording tbeir em
plovesmore certain ami steady labor, with its re
sulting quiet ami coutentment.
The question thus imperatively presented for
solution should be appi.wchcd in a spirit higher
than partisanship, and considered in the lifiht ot
that regard for patriotic duty which should
characterize the action of those intrusted with
the weal of a confiding people. But thoobliga
taou to declared party policy and principle is not
wanting to urge prompt and effective action.
Both ol the great political parties now repre
sented in the government, have, by repeated .
and authoritative declarations, condemned the
condition of our laws which permit Uie collec
tion from Uie people of unnecessary revenue,
and have, in Uie most solemn manner, promised
as correction ; and neither as citizens or parti
sans are our countrymen in a mood to condone
the deliberate violation of these pledges.
Onr progress toward a wise conclusion win not
be improved by dwelling upon the theories of
protection and free trade. This savors too much
of bandying epithets. It is a condition which
confronts ue not a theory. Relief from this
condition may involve a slight redaction of Uie
advantages which we award our home produc
tions, but the entire withdrawal of such advan
tages should not be cnntemplated. The question
o! free trade is absolutely irrelevant, and Uie per
sistent claims made in certain quarters, that all
effort to relieve Uie people from unjust and un
necessary taxation are ec hemes of so-called free
traders, is mischievous and far removed from
any consideration for Uie public good. The
simple and plain duty which we owe Uie people
is to reduce taxation to the uecesearv expenses
of an economical operation of the government,
and to restore to the business of the country Uie
money winch we hold in the treasury through
Uie perversion of governmental powers. These
things can and should be done with safety to all
our industries, without danger to Uie opportun
ity for remunerative labor which onr working
men need, and with benefit toUiem and all our
people, by cheapening their means uf subsis
tence and increasing Uie measure ol their com
forts. The constitution provides that the president
" shult from time to time, give to ine congress
information of the state of Uie Union." It has
been the custom of the executive, iu compliance
with this provision, to annually exhibit to the
congress, at the opening of its session, Uie gen
eral condition of the country, and to detail, with
some particularity, the operations of the differ
ent escutive departments It would be espe
cially agreeable to follow this conrseat the pres
ent time, and to call attention to uie valuable
accomplish uoeuts of these departments during
the last fiscal year, but I am so much impressed
with Uie paramount importance of the subject
to which this commnnicanou has Urns far been
devoted, that I shall forego the addition of anv
other topic and only urge upon your immediate
cousideration Uie "state of the Union" as sh wn
in the present condition of our treasury aud our
general fiscal situation, upon which every ele
ment of our safety and prosperity depends.
The reports of the heads of deartme!its, which
will be submitted, contain lull and explicit

There are other subjects not embraced in the

THE TARIFF REFORMERS PLEASED.

Washtnoton City, Pee. 7. While the presi

ed character, yet the protectionists could not
help beiug startled at Uie bold sentences. The
greatoat attention was accorded Uie reading,
particularly by the Kepublicans. Satief action
was shown on Uie face of every tariff reformer in

most hysterical In their suppressed feelings.

giving marked attention until the reading was
nearly through, when he took up the printed
copy of the message and bet: an reading for him
self. The message seemed to cause more of a
sensation amoug the Kepublicans than with the
Democrat.. Nearly every one pronounced it a
unique document and decidedly forcible.
The reading of the message in the senate was
listened to with attention, but very many of the
senators, after adjournment, upon being asked
for their opinion of Uie document.said they pre
ferred to examine It more closely itefore declar
ing themselves. The judgment of the senate
may be summarized generally by stating that
the Democrats pronounced it an able state pa
per, while the Kepublicans say it is a free trade
message, intended to influence the house in be
half of free trade legislation.
After the adjournment of the house Reed nf
Maine was asked his opinion of the message. He
aid it was a surprise, but there was nothing new
in it, except that it placed the Democracy square
ly npon a platform of free trade, unless that par
ty wanted to disown, the administration. He
thought it made the very issue Uie Republicans
desired.
This was the general view of the Republican,
while Uie Democrats looked upon it as a forcible
state paper, and declared Uie party would stand
by it.

Be said: '"There will be a reduction of
taxation at this session to the extent of AtiU.uUU,
UJO or more, but not on the exact line of the
president's suggestions. The internal revenue
will be reduced in part, or in a large degree re
moved, which the president does not seem to
favor, and some reductions will be made in the
rates of duties on Imports."
English Opinion nf the Message.
London, Deo. 7. The synopsis of Cleveland's
message to congress, which was cabled here and
published in Tuesday afternoon's pajfera, was
read with a great deal of interest. The mes
sage, which la regarded generally as very im
portant, is warmly indorsed by fair traders.
while free traders assert that it marks a long
forward stride toward the goal of universal free
dom in trade. The concensus of opinion is that
should congress adopt toe suggestions so une
quivocally made by Mr. Cleveland the first effect
would be beneficial to a large number of English
industries, though after a tune an adjustment
would necessarily take place, which would inev
itably work to the detriment of some others.

COLLAPSE OF A WATER TOWER WITH
FRIGHTFUL EFFECTS.
Five Workmen Crashed to Death, Others
TConnded, and Four Left Clinging to a

Ground The Latter Extricated from
Their Perilous Position.
Macok, Ga., Deo. 7. Pour men were instantly
killed, three seriously and perhaps fatally in
(ured, aud four left clinging like human files
to Uie ruins sixty-fire feet above the ground, by
the falling ot a water tower at Thorn as vi lie, Ga.,
Tuesday morning. It was about 10 o'clock when
the crash came. It could be beard for half a
mile, and people rushed to the scene from every
direction. A horrible sight met their eyes. Pro
truding from the ruins could be seen portions of
the bodies ot the dead and injured, the latter
calliug for assistance, while clinging to the Bides
of that portion of the tower still standing, with
nothing to ol uteh or rest their feet on but preca
riously projecting bricks, were Ibur men left un
tnjured by Uie crash, but in Imminent danger of
being daBhod to pieces by falling to the stones
below.
Although! of rescuing the dead and Injured
was temporarily abandoned in the face of the
peril of those clinging to Uie walL Whan the
hook and ladder company arrived a new horror
was added to Uie situation by the discovery that
Uie ladders would not reach within twenty feet
of the men above. A rescue with ropes was Uie
only chance left. A brick tied to a cord, which
was in turn fastened to a rope, was thrown into
Uie air, and fell on the other side of the wall. A
score of hands quickly pulled the rope within
reach of one ot Uie imperiled men.
At this moment the wall swayed and looked as
if it was about to tumble over and add more vic
tims to the death list, but it did not, and the
man released his hold of the bricks, went down
Uie rope hand over hand until he reached the
top of the ladder, and descended to the ground.
As he reached the earth a great cheer went up
fo-m Uie crowd, but it quickly subsided at re
membrance of the danger the remaining three
men were still confronting. The rope was
moved from one of the trio to the ottter until at
last all Btood safe below.
The men thus snatched from the jaws of death
are: 1'arneU, white, brick-mason; W. Spearing,
white; William Walton, colored, and Joseph
Earnest, colored.
Attention was next turned to those buried in
the debris. The following were taken out dead,
terribly crushed and disfigured: T. J. P. Hom

Fabian, colored; Lewis Wells, colored.

recovery of Uie others is still problematical.
The accident was caused by Uie removal of
the supports which acted as braces between the
onter walls of the tower and the center piece,
solid piece of brick masonry six feet in diame
ter and seventy feet in height. The strain caused
by the hoisting of brick to Uie top of the tower
caused the pier to oscillate and finally collapse,
iemolishing Uie outer wail, and it fell, carrying
with it Uie scaffolding ou which the men were
itiil at work. That none of the people passing in
the street below were not killed is surprising.
