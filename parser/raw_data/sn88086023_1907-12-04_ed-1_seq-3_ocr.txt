Fte Sh'ange Necessary
In teal! ieniidiis
Following aro those portions of
President Roosevelt's meHSfrgo to con
. gress upon subject especially Im
portant to the west currency, Inland
waterways, Irrigation and public
lands. The president says:
In mv message to congress a year
ago I Bpoke as follows on tho cur
rency: "I especially call your attention to
tho condition of our currency laws.
The national bank act has ably served
a great purpose In aiding the enor
mous business development of tho
country, and wrthln 10 years there
has been an increase in circulation
per capita from $21.41 to $33.08. For
Bcveral years evidence hns been ac
cumulating that additional legislation
Is needed. The recurrence of each
crop season emphasizes the defects
of the present laws.
"There must Boor. De a revision of
them, because to leave them as they
are means to Incur liability of busi
ness disaster. Slnee your body ad
journed there has been a fluctuation
In tho Interest on call money from 2
per cent to 30 per cent, and the fluc
tuation was even greater during the
preceding six months. Tho secretary
of the treasury had to step in and
by wise action put a stop to the most
violent period of oscillation.
"Even worse than such fluctuatoln
Is the advance In commercial rates
and the uncertainty felt In the suffic
iency of credit even at high rates. All
commercial Interests suffer during
each crop period. 'Excessive rates for
call money In New York attract mon
ey from the Interior banks Into the
speculative field. This depletes the
fund that would otherwise be availa
ble for commercial uses, and commer
cial borrowers are forced to pay
abnormal rates, so that each fall a
tax. In tho shape of Increased inter
est charges, Is placed on the whole
commerce of the country.
"The mere statement of these facts
shows that our present system Is se-
. rlously defective. There Is need of)
a change. Unfortunately, however,
many of the proposed changes must
be ruled from consideration because
they are complicated, are not ensy of
comprehension, and tend to 'disturb
existing rlghtH and Interests. W"5
must also rule out any play which
would materially Impnlr the value of
the United States 2 per cent bonds
now pledged to secure circulation, the
Issue of which was made under con
ditions peculiarly creditable to the
treasury. I do not press any spec
ial plan.
Various plnns have recently been
proposed by expert committees of
bankers. Among the plans which are
possibly feasible and which certain
ly should receive your consideration
Is that repeatedly brought to your at
tention by the present secretary of
the treasury, the essential features of
which , have been approved by many
prominent tankers and business men.
According to this plan national banks
should be permitted to Issue a speci
fied proportion of their capital In
notes-of given kind, the Issue to be
taxed at so high a rate as to drive tho
notes back when not wanted to legi
timate trade. This plan would not
permit the Issue of currency to give
banks additional profits, but to meet
the emergency presented by times of
stringency.
"I do not nay thnt this is the right
system. I only advance it to empha
size my belief that there Is need for
the adoption of some system which
shall bo automatic and open to all
sound banks, so as to nvold all pos
sibility of discrimination and favor
itism. Such a plan would tend to
prevent the spasms of high money
and speculation which now obtain In
the New arW market; for at present
there Is too much currency at certain
seasons of the year, and Its accumu
lation at New York tempts bankers
to lend It at low rates for specula
tive purposes; whereat .at other times
when the crops are being moved there
Is urgent need for a large but tem
porary Increase In the currency sup
ply. It must never be forgotten that this
question concerns business men gen
erally quite as much as bankers; es
pecially Is this true of stockmen,
farmers, and business ' men In the
west, for at present at certain seasons
of the year the difference In interest
rates between the east and tho west
Is from 6 to 10 per cent; whereas In
Canada the corresponding difference
Is but 2 per cent. Any plan must, of
course, guard the Interests of New
York and Chlcngo bankers, and must
be drawn from the standpoints of tho
farmer and the merchant are less
than from the standpoint of the
city bankers and the country bank
ers." T again urge on the congress tho
need of Immediate attention to this
matter. We need a greater elasticity
In our currency; provided, of course,
that we recognize the even greater
need of a safe and secure currency.
There must always be the most rigid
examination by tho natlonnl author
ities. Provisions should be made for
an emergency currency. Tho emer
gency Issue should, of course, be
made with an effective guaranty,
and upon conditions carefully pre
scribed by the government.
Such emergency Issue must be bas
ed on ndeqtiate securities approved
by tho government, and must bo Issu
ed under a heavy tax. This would
permit currency being issued when
the demand for It was urgent, while

grocers west of the Rocky
Mountains.

securing Its retirement ns the demand
fell off. It is worth investigating to
determine whether officers and direc
tors of national banks should, ever be
allowed to loan to themselves. Trust
companies should be subject to the
same supervision as banks; legislation
to this effect should .be enacted for
the District of Columbia and the ter
ritories. Yet we must also remember that
even the wisest legislation on the
subject can only accomplish a certain
amount. No legislation can by any
possibility guarantee the business
community against the results of
speculative folly any more than It can
guarantee an Individual against, tho
rj-sult of his extravagance. When an
Individual mortgages his house to buy
an automobile he Invites disaster; and
when wealthy men, or men who pose
as such, or are unscrupulously or
foolishly eager to become such, in
dulge In reckless speculation espec
ially if it Is accompanied by dishon
esty they Jeopardize not only their
own future, but the future of all their

pose the whole business community

The Income account of the nation
Is in a most satisfactory condition
For the six fiscal years ending with
the first ..of July last, the total ex
pendltures and revenues of the na
tlonal government, exclusive of the
postal revenues and expenditures.
were. In round numbers, revenues,
$3,465,000,000, and expenditures,
$3,275,000,000. The net excess of In
come -over expenditures. Including In
the latter the $50,000,000 expended
for the Panama canal, was $190,000,-
000 for the six years, an average of
about $31,000,000 a year.
This represents an approximation
between Income and outgo which It
would be hard ot Improve. The sat
isfactory working of the present tar
iff law has been chiefly responsible
for this excellent showing. Never
theless, there Is an evident and con
stantly growing feeling among our
people that the time Is rapidly ap
proaching when our system of reve
nue legislation must be revised.
The Tariff.
This country Is definitely commit
ted to the protective system and any
effort to uproot it could not but cause
widespread Industrial disaster. In
other words, the principle of the
present tariff law could not with wis
dom be changed. But In a country
of such phenomenal growth as ours
It Is probably well that every dozen
years or so the tariff laws should be
carefully scrutinized so as to see that
no excessive or Improper benefits are
conferred thereby, that proper reve
nue Is provided, and that our foreign
trade is encouraged.
There must always be as a mini
mum a tariff which will not only al
low for the collection of an ample
revenue, but which will at least make
good the difference In cost of produc
tion here and abroad; that Is, the dif
ference In the labor cost here and
abroad, for the well-being . of the
wage-worker must ever be a -cardinal
point of American policy. The ques
tion should be approached purely
from a business standpoint; both the
time and the manner of the chnnge
such as to arouse the minimum of
agitation and disturbance In the bus
iness world, and to give the least play
for selfish and factional motives.' '
The sole consideration should "be
to see that the sum total of changes;
represents the public good. This
means that the subject can not with
wisdom be dealt with In the year pre
ceding a presidential election
Inland Wntrrwuya.
The conservation of our natural re-i
sources and their proper use consti
tute the fundamental problem which
underlies almost every other problem,
of our national life. We must main
tain for our civilization the adequate
material basis without which thnt
civilization can njt exist. We must
show foresight, we must look ahead.
As a nation we not only enjoy a
wonderful measure of present pros
perity, but If thft prosperity Is used
aright It Is an earnest of future suc
cess such as no other nation will have.
The reward of foresight for this na
tion Is great and easily foretold. But
there must be the look ahead, there
must be a realization of the fact that
to waste, to destroy, our natural re
sources, to skin and exhaust th land
Instead of using it so as to Increase
Its usefulness, will result in undermin
ing In the days of our children and
the very prosperity which we ought
by right to hand down to them am
plified and developed.
For tho last few years, through sev
eral agencies, the government has
been endeavoring to get our people
to look ahead and to substitute a
planned and 'orderly development of
our resources In place of a haphaz
ard striving for Immediate profit.
Our great river systems should ho
developed as national water high
ways; the Mississippi, with Its tribu
taries, standing first In Importance,
and tho Columbia second, although
there are many others of Importance
on the Pacific, the Atlantic ajid the
Gulf slopes. The national govern
ment should undertake this work, and
I hopo a bcglnnlifg will be made In
the present congress; and the great
est of all our rivers, the Mississippi,
should receive especial attention.
From the great lakes to the mouth
of the Mississippi there should be a
deep waterway, with . deep 'water
ways leading from It to the east and
west. Such a waterway would prac
tically mean the extension of our
coast lino into the very heart of our
country. It would be of Incalculable
benefit to our people.
If begun at once It can be carried
through In time appreciably to re
lleve the congestion of our great
freight-carrying lines of railroads.
Tho work should bo systematically
The new Pure Food Law requires every pat
ent medicine manufacturer to tell just what dan
gerous drug is in his medicine. Certain period
icals.interested in patent medicine reform have
declared that the formulas of many patent medi
cines will have to 1 2 dunged before the manu
facturers will dare co-.fjrm with this law. These
periodicals also deck: c that the public wiil never
know of these changes, and never know what
these remedies formerly contained.
This suspicion, however, cannot rest upon Rex
all Remedies. You have absolute proof that
Rexall Remedies have not been changed to con-
form with the new Pure Food Law, because you
knew the formulas of these remedies Jour years ago
The Rexall formulas were nrocr secret. The
thousand Rexall druggists have always known all
the Rexall formulas and given them to every cus
tomer who asked for them.
No one Rexall Remedy was ever claimed to
be a 4,cure-all" each of the 300 remedies is de
signed to cure a certain human ill and does it.
These 300 remedies were selected from among
thousands because they were the most reliable
and successful cures in the wprld.. Far from,
wishing to conceal the formulas of these remedies,
ive are proud to tell just what they are, and al
ways l ave been.
That's where the Rexall plan goes further to
safeguard you than does the Pure Food Lav.
Even now youll only know the dangerous drugs
in other patent medicines, while you have always
been able to know the complete formulas of Rex
all Remedies !
The Rexall guarantee has been the greatest
evidence of the sincerity back of the Rexall Rem
edies. For four years Rexall druggists have
offered to return the money to any one who
brought back an empty Rexall bottle or package
and said they were not satisfied.
We, as one of the Rexall druggists, feel a gen
uine satisfaction in having been able to supply
this community for four years with one line of
medicines which the United States Govern
ment by its new Pure Food Law shows were
always made right and sold right, and have de
served every bit of the faith you have had in
them.
The Pure Food Law may necessitate changes
in other patent medicines, but it only endorses
Rexall Remedies.

Remedies, one for each human ill,
are:

Gentian ij recognized in medicine a one
of the greatest tonici ever discovered. Jt
combines the tonic powers of all known
"bitters," with none of the disadvantages
applying to any. .
Cubebs have long been recognized as a
specific in the treatment of all catarrhal
conditions, ltt action is prompt and its
benelit almost invariable.
Cascara Sagrada is especially Introduced
for its unapproachable laxative properties.
The combination of these with Glycerine
and Sarsaparilla makes Mucu-Tone a
remedy that attacks catarrh from every
point and gradually restores the diseased
tissues. Bottle, MIC.
FOR NERVES - AMERICA. KITIS lUXlft
The Rexall Americanltis Elixir is a ton
Jc nerve food composed chiefly of free
Phosphorus, Glycoyhosphates, Iron Pyro
phosphate and Calisaya.
The wonderful results of this remedy are
due to the fact that it supplies Phosphor
ous to the nerve cells in a condition in
which it can bo immediately and easily
taken up by them.
The Glycophosphates, actual nerve-tissue
builders, are one of the most recent
and valuable additions to this branch of
medicine and unquestionably a more effi
cientrs.nedy than the well-known Hypo-
phosphites. ,
The Iron Pyrophosphates are the most
easily assimilated form of iron which giva

of Calisaya Bark have a tonic effect on at

carried forward In accordance with
some well-conceived plan. The main
streams should be Improved to the
highest point of efficiency before the
improvement of the branches Is at
tempted; and the work should be
kept free from every tn'nt of reck
lessness or Jobbery.
The Inland waterways which lie
Just back of the whole eastern and
southern coasts should likewise be
developed. Moreover, the develop
ment of our waterways Involves
many other Important water prob
lems, all of which should be consid
ered as part of the same general
cheme. The government dams
thould be used to produce hundreds
of thousands of horsepower as an In
cident to Improving navigation; for
the annual value of the unused wa
ter power of the I'nited States per
haps exceeds the annual value of the
products of nil our mines. As an
incident to creating the deep water
way down the Mississippi, the gov
ernment should build along Its whole
length levees which taken together
with the control of the headwaters,
will at once and forever put a com
plete stop to all threat of floods In
the immensely ' fertile delta regions.
The territory lying adjacent to the
Mississippi along its lower course
will thereby become one of the most
prosperous and populous, as It al
ready Is one of the most fertile,
farming regions in all the world. I
have appointed nil Inland Waterways
commission to study and outline a
comprehensive pche"mc of develop
ment nion? all the lines Indicated.
Later I shall lay Its report before
tho congress.
nccliiiuntioii 'Work.
Irrigation should be far more ex
tensively developed than at present,
not only in the states of the great
plains and the Uoeky mountains, but
In many others, as, for instance, in
largo portions of the Pouth Atlantic
and gulf states, where it should go
hand In hand with the reclamation i
of swamp land. The federal govern
ment should seriously devote Itself
to this task, realizing that utilization
of waterways and water-power, for
estry, Irrigation, and the reclamation
of lands threatened with overflow,
are nil Interdependent parts of the
same problem. The work of the rec
lamation service In developing the
larger opportunities of the western
half of our country for Irrigation Is
more Important than almost any
other movement.
The constant purpose of the gov
ernment In connection with the rec
lamation service has been to use the
water resources of the public lands
for the ultimate greatest good of the
greatest number; in other words, to
put upon the land permanent home
makers, to use and develop It for
themselves and for their children
and children's children. There has
been, of course, opposition to this
work; opposition from some Interest
ed men vho desire to exhaust the
land for their own Immediate profit
without regard to the welfare of the
next generat on, and the opposition
from honest and well-meaning men
who did not fully understand the
subject or who did not look far
enough ahead.
This opposition is. I think, dying
away, and our people are understand
ing that It would be utterly wrong
to allow a few Individuals to exhaust
for their own temporary personal
profit the resources which ought to
bo developed through use so as to
be conserved for the permanent
common advantage of the people as
a whole.
Public. IjiihIs.
The effort of the government to
deal with the public land has been
based upon the same principle as
that of the reclamation service. The
land law system which was designed
to meet the needs of the fertile and
well watered regions of the middle
west has largely broken down when
applied to the dryer regions of the
great plains, the mountains and
much of the Pacific slope, where a
farm of 100 acres is Inadequate for
self-support. In these regions the
system lent itself to fraud, and much
land passed out of the hands of the
government without passing Into the
hands of the home maker.
The department of the Interior and
the department of Justice Joined In
prosecuting the offenders against the
law; and they have accomplished
much, while where the administra
tion of the law has been defective It
has been changed. But the laws
themselves are defective. Three
years ago a public lands commission
was appointed to scrutinize the law,
and. defects and recommend a rem
edy.
Their examination specifically
showed the existence of great fraud
upon the public domain, and their
recommendations for changes In the
law were made with the design of
conserving the natural resources of
every prfrt of the public lands by
putting it to its best use. Especial
attention was called to the preven
tion of settlement by the passage of
great areas of public land into the
hands of n few men, and to the enor
mous waste caused by unrestricted
