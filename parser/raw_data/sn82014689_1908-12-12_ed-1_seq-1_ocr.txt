HUGH
Opened For
Settlement
Rosebud Reservation Lands
Distributed by Lot.
Once more the Country lias wit
nessed perhaps for the last time a
scene which has been typical of life
in the United States, the opening of
a new area of government land to
settlers.
The scene this time was in South
Dakota, and the area the Rosebud
Indian reservation, eight hundred
uitl twenty-eight thousand acres, a
large portion of which. is valued at
twenty-live dollars an acre. It was
distributed, in quarter-sections of
one hundred and sixty acres each,
among the somewhat more than
five thousand fortunate applicants.
The methods of distributing gov
ernment land have been and are
open to serious criticism. Former
ly it was "first come, first served,"
but as the .crush and brutalities of
the Oklahoma "dash" were in
tolerable, a system of distribution by
lot was adopted.
For the somewhat more than "five
thousand lots just distributed there
were two hundred thousand registra
tions (applicants). Exchange.
After hearing so much from
democratic speakers the last election
campaign that our good old Uncle
Samuel is ready to give out quarter
section" farms of a hundred and
sixty acres apiece to the landless
for the sum of fourteen dollars, and
what the landless voters needed for
the upbuilding of Hawaii was an
extension of the said American land
laws in the form administered on
the Mainland to the public lands of
this Territory, it seems the special
American land laws for homestead
ers 'as proclaimed by our friends of
the democratic faith existed only in
the realms of fancy. In the Rose
bud land distribution good Uncle
Samuel expects his husky nephews
to pay 84,000.00 apiece for a
quarter-section farm, and to prevent
the brutalities likely to happen in a
rush for land the allotment plan
Was adopted and all who are lucky
enough to draw a winning number
are only entitled to the privilege of
paying twenty-five dollars an acre
or four thousand dollars for a
quarter section farm.
It is reassuring to find that after
all our own land laws are not as bad
as the outs would have it, and that
the homestead laws on the Main
land as well as in this Territory are
worked out on a safe and sane
basis. And in the distribution of
homesteads at least the Yankee love
for a "chance to get something at a
bargain is tempered by the inborn
spirit of Yankee thrift.

Winery At
Kaupakalua
Expects' to Turn Out 75,000
Gallons Next Season.
The Kaupakalua Wine and Li
quor Company, Limited, has pro
duced about 28,000 gallons of first
class wine, and about 7.000 gallons
of fruit brandy this season. The
brandy produced ranges from 100
to 1G0 per cent test, and in the
opinion of experts is an excellent
article for Uie home tiade.
The winery was started shortly
after the passage of the general li
quor law of 1905, in which liberal
provisions were made for the pro
duction of wine from home re
sources. In the opinion of Geo.
II. Carter, tlfcn Governor, there
was no reason why our own people
shbuld not b given a chance to
manufacture wine, when hundreds
of thousands of gallons of Califor
nia wine was being regularly im
ported to supply a crowing demand
for wines.
Through Governor Carter's in
fluence the provision allowing the
manufacturing of winfs in this
Territory was incorporated in the
liquor law of 1905, and to people
of sniall.means are to be given the
credit of starting this n iw industry,
in industry which promises in
time to, at least, supply the, home
demand for wince, giving both em
ployment and encouragement to
the numerous small farmers of the
Kokomo and Kaupakalua portions
of the makawao district.
The winery gets it supply of
grapes from sixty or more, small
vineyards, the plantings rang
ing in area from half 1 an acre to
four acres, a self evident proof of
the cooperative nature of the in
dustry, arid of the support it is re
ceiving from small land holders
and people of small :nenns.
Much of the success of the win
ery is due to the able management
of Mr. W, F. Cole, who is an ex
pert in the making of different
grades of wines and brandy, and
the Winery Company is preparing
to enlarge its plant from the pre
sent capacity of 30,000 gallons a
season, and is putting in new iir.-
provemgents at an expense of $2 -500
00 to be in a position to profi
tably handle the crop from the ma
ny new vineyards the next season.
The grape 'growers are almost
wholly Portuguese who are evident
ly doing wclh, judging by the way
the older farmers are increasing
the area of their plantings! and of
new men coming to locate in the
grape growing district, improving
proporty and growing intp the bu
siness, with so much confidence as
to the successful outcome of their
efforts.-
In the 1907 season the winery
purchased, tHirty-eight tons of
grapes, and in the season just
closed ninety-five tons paying
thorefor forty dollars a ton deliv
ered. The uvorago production this
year being a little over threo tons
of grap'e an acre, which is consider
ed a very good showing for young
vine 8, and experts say as the vino
yards become older the vines will
produco larger and richer orops.
The crop of the year 19,07 was
taken from 25 acres of vines, an
average of a-littlo over one and a
half tons of cranes an acre, nro-
ducing about' 12,000 gallons while
that of this year, rJOo. was from
thirty-ono acres of grapes, showing
bui a small increaso in the grape
area, and over a hundred per cent
increaso in the quantity of wine
produced.

Cohen's Views
On Taxation
Wants Rates Increased to
1 12 Percent.
Honorable Joel Cohen, during
his recent visit to Hilo, gave some
particulars of the ideas he has been
incubating on the land and taxa
tion questions. In an interview
with the Hawaii Herald ho is quo
ted as follows.
"As to taxation, tho plantations
pay one per cent, upon the valua
tion of their property. This is not
enough to meet the demands of
government. The tax assessor, is
expected to make good so he taxes
the small property holder on a va
luation .of two to one. For instance
where plantation property may bp
valued at $1000, the small holder
who owns land of equal value with
the plantation is taxed zn an as
sessed value of 2000 for his little
piece. The government needs the
money, and even then there are
not enough small property owners
to make up the deficiency, so we
run behind as we are doing at the
present time.
"Take Ewa plantation, us an ex
ample, which pays. 0110 per cent, on
a valuation of $5,500,000, that is
$55,000, and an income tax of $1(5,
000, making its total tax amount
to 71,000. If instead of taxing
the small man on a basis of double
the property valuation that Ewa
pays, the assessed value wet e divid
ed equally and the tax rate raised to
1 1-2 per cent., the ilSwa would pay
882,500, a difference of 811,500.
This will give an equalization of
assessment, the same tax rate for
all, but it would result in a large
revenue for the Territory. It
would not bo any hardship upon
Ewa as the incicoFo of 811,500 in
its taxes would only be one-fifth of
one per cent, upon its capital
stock. It would be a homeopathic
dose. .
"Another thing that I find is
that the big men practically pay
no income tax . Tjiat is a direct
contribution to the revenue from
the small man and, as I Under
stand it, a charge upon bis labor.
'1 he big men, who own the large
blocks of sugar stock, claim that
they pay their income tax indirect
ly through the company which h
assessed on its stock. Then again
there are the owneis of our Hawa
iian stocks, who live away from
hero on incomes' derived fr.om their
investments on these Islands. They
have their homes on the mainland
or in Europe. They make a small
payment to the revenue on the
stock they hold but do nothing else
whatever to benofit these islands,
only draining them of largo sums
of money.
"The income tax has been held
to he unconstitutional in those
Stats where it has been tested, and
my opinion is that it is unconsti
tutional. Hero it is not an income
tax but a tax on labor. Men who
have incomes, largo incomes, do
not pay any such tax as tho law
calls for. Hut tho man who sells
his labor, even at a rate of four
dollars a day, has to pay it. Tho
clerk, tho salesman, the bookkeeper
all sell their labor and tboy are
the ones who pay tho income tax
Any man who is earning wages is
a laborer. Ho sells his labor for
those wages and he is tho only
0110 who pays income tax, The
laborer is said to bo worthy of his
biro. Then why not let him keep
his hire instead of taking a part of
it for taxes just because ho is a la-
boror.

Carnegie was subpoenaed to testify before the Wavs and Means
Committee relative to tariff revision.
"The gross amount of revenue
provided the Teriitory from the
property tax at one per cent, is
1,275,000, and from income tax
82(19,000, a total of 81.54-1,000. My
idea is to eliminate ihe income tax
and have a straight property tax
of 1 1-2 per cent, with an equable
assessment. This will give a total
revenue of $1,912,000, an increase
of 83(18,000. Half pf the revenue
goes to the Territory and half to
(he Counties. I would .ilso give
the entire collections from licenses
to the Counties. The Territory
would lose S100.000. If the levo"
11 ue of the Territory were not suffi
cient, then increase the property
valuation for a sessment purposes
or reduce its expenses. This last
has neyer been tried since annexa
tion Jind I believe that it could be
done in some dotmrtmonts. They
always ask for more money but
never .suggest one single economy.
'Everybody admits that our pre
sent system oi administering tho
public lands is wrong and most
will agree that tho leasehold sys
tem which prevails throughout tho
Islands is wrong. Everyone ad
mits that our system of taxation
is wrong, that our wealthy escape
with a lower percentage of taxation
than the poor, but no one has come
out openly to suggest measures
that will equalize matters. There
is a decided fear on tho part of our
public men that they would anta
gonize tho big interests of the Ter
ritory if they pressed too vigorous
ly for reforms. In private conversa
tions our officials from tho lowest to
the highest will agree that things
arc wrong in Hawaii, but none is
willing to mako any clean-cut pub
lic declaration nor give counte
nance to any declaration of policy
along the lines privately v agreed
upon.

ramount issues in Hawaii today.
