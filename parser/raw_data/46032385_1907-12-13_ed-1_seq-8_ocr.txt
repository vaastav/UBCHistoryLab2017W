THE CLEVELAND Electric Railway company,
the five-cent street railway fare corpora
tion, has surrendered to the holding plan pro
posal of Mayor Tom L. Johnson, after seven
-years of warfare. The story is told by the Cleve
land correspondent for the Chicago Record-Herald
in this way: "The surrender was made in
a public meeting of councilmen, councilmen
elect, mayor, city officers, officers of the traction
company and Fred H. Goff, an outsider named
yesterday by the Cleveland Electric to conduct
negotiations. Mr. Goff is empowered to accept
terms from Mayor Johnson, with no report to
the Cleveland Electric, and in his address to the
meeting today agreed to the merger of three
cent and five-cent roads under a holding com
pany, and declared all that remained was the
fixing of the figure at which the Cleveland. Elec
tric stock shall be taken over. Appraisers, Pres
ident Andrews of the corporation and President
Dupont of the three-cent line, were named, with
lawyers and real estate experts to assist, to fix
a valuation on . the old company's property.
These appraisers are to report to a meeting
Tuesday. Mayor Johnson and Mr. Goff asserted
peace, was in sight. On the stock exchange to
day Cleveland Electric, which had dropped to
32, picked up five points on bid, and offers
reached fifty before the closing hour. The stock
exchange action was a reflection of the wide
spread belief that the long warfare wa's about to
cease. The appointment of Mr. Goff, a lawyer
without interest in the traction controversy ex
cept as a citizen, with full powers from the
directors of the Cleveland Electric Railway com
pany to sign terms of settlement for the five
cent corporation with. Mayor Johnson, champion
of the three-cent fare, and his council came yes
terday at the first break in the old company's
attitude of determined opposition to Mayor
Johnson's proposals."

xj. xiurton, wno advocated the traction settle
ment proposal of the Cleveland Electric, as a
, mayoralty candidate against Tom L. Johnson,
President Andrews of the company continued
the policy of adhering to the corporation's seveh-yoar-old
position that a three-cent fare was 1m-
, B!bie ?n ,hls system with its long hauls, and
what he insists is the best service in any Amer
ican city. But the city council, led by Mayor
Johnson refused to arbitrate as to the lowest
possible fare to be incorporated in extended
franchises of the company or as to the value of
the Cleveland Electric, in consideration of its
being turned over to a holding company, as
urged by the mayor. The traction corporation
was face to face with a war of extermination.
Bictrminati11 would have been slow, as several
of the Cleveland Electrlc's franchises have eight
years of life, but others expire next February
and still others two and five years hence The
system would have been cut to pieces, with prac
tically nothing of value left, in six or seven
years had Mayor Johnson clung to his announced
program of giving the three-cent fare companies
franchises as rapidly as the old companies ex
pired, with franchises to joint use of the old
company's tracks,- where possible, at once. Mr
Golf, though conceding today that the mayor's
holding plan of merging the five and three-cent
fare companies will be agreed to by the com
pany he represents, still has the option of re
fusing to sign the treaty if the valuation of the
Cleveland Electric is lower than ho thinks equit
able or if the rate of fare should bo lower than
he thinks will pay a profit to the companies,
although, under the holding plan, the holding
AfiSL
company must give a security bond to the lessors,
assuring stockholders of a profit. It is certain
that Mayor Johnson will insist on a three-cent
fare within the present city limits. This matter
is not determined, but it is expected the fare
to points outside the limits will be five cents,
with transfers at no extra charge. Mayor John
son has incorporated in his traction proposals
and franchises granted to his self-inspired com
panies a clause providing that if a three-cent
fare does not pay six per cent profit a higher
rate may be charged up to the point at which
six per cent can be earned on real valuation.
Settlement of the real valuation of the Cleveland
Electric, with the rate of fare equation involved,
is the point at issue now that the corporation
has surrendered to Mayor Johnson."
CONGRESSMAN Ollie James of Kentucky has
introduced a bill providing for the restor
ation to coins of the motto, "In God We Trust."
Speaking to the Washington correspondent for
the New York World Mr. James said: "After
six years of flourishing the big stick, President
Roosevelt has at last removed one trust, that's
'In God We Trust.' In removing the motto he
struck one of the greatest blows to religion and
morality that has ever been given in this coun
try. He says that some' one may laugh at the
motto. Such an argument, if followed to its
logical conclusion, would tear down every church
steeple in the land. Mr. Roosevelt will soon
find that his countrymen do not sympathize with
him in his willingness to abolish the motto which
expressed the national gratitude to the Creator."
DESCRIBING THE opening of congress the
Washington correspondent for the Chicago
Record-Herald says: "Crowds of men and
women who Jn their way represent the citizen
ship, the chivalry and the fashion of the. country
at the national capital thronged the senate and
house galleries to witness the inauguration of
a new congress. Hundreds who came late
packed the gallery corridors and waited with
varying degrees of patience for the ticket-holders
and early birds to become bored and depart so
as to give them a chance near the finish to say
that they had seen and heard something of the
curtain-raiser to the winter's session. The star
figure in the stage setting was a rank outsider,
insofar as the personnel of- congress is concerned,
but one who is far from being a non-combatant
in the politics that underlie the present situa
tion. W. J. Bryan of Nebraska it was. An
actor without a set part, he walked upon the
floor of the house fifteen minutes before the
gavel fell, evoking full five minutes of cheers,
handclapping and yells from his party col
leagues there gathered, and equally tumultuous
enthusiasm among his admirers in the galleries.
Bryan, the foreordained candidate for the presi
dency on the democratic ticket, was not there
"merely for show. For three hours he was the
busiest personage in sight."
A NUMBER of the daily newspapers, carried
- , recently a flaming advertisement of a cer
tain magazine. This advertisement contained
the picture of Mr. Roosevelt and was printed
under big black headlines, as follows: "Theo
dore Roosevelt Destroyer." Following is an
extract from the advertisement: "Theodore
Roosevelt can never patch up the harm he has
done. It will take years of patient toil to build
up what he has already torn down. It wilL take
millions of idle machines and miles of hungry
bread lines to pay the price of atonement if his
destructive policies are permitted to continue.
Under the guise of punishing wrong-doers, his
policies threaten to paralyze practically every
line of legitimate business. They threaten every
man who works for his living. They threaten
your salary, your savings, your job. It is no
argument to say that there are evils to be cor
rected. There are. But the big stick seeks
not to correct. It seeks to destroy. The life
the history, the writings and the utterances of
Theodore Roosevelt proclaim him to be, by na
ture, a destroyer, and not a tolling builder
They breathe only the thought of destruction!
destruction of animal life, of human life, and of
the liberty, the property and the reputations of
men. And the dominant thought of his present
publicly expressed policies is not upbuilding the
nation and the industries of the nation, but de
struction to those very enterprises which have
made the nation .great. And destruction, ven
geance and punishment for the men who have
builded the industries that have made us the
VOLUME 7, NUMBER
masters of the whole world of business- ntu
than any attempt to correct abundant evil?
Should the innocent be made, wantonly to R r
fer with the guilty? Should the whole fabric 5
public confidence be utterly destroyed? Should
your savings be imperiled because of another'
wrong-doing? Should your child be robbed n?
its bread because of the misdeed of a trust or a
railroad? Every man in business, largo 0r
small, employer or employe, should read 'Tho
Square Deal, and Do We Get It?' 'Theodora
Roosevelt's Private Press Bureau,' 'How Roose
velt Exploits the Newspapers' and other fearless
instructive articles in the December number of
the Magazine."
TT IS BELIEVED by many 'people that the
X above advertisement is not entirely a bit
of magazine enterprise, but is as well part and
parcel of a plan to discredit the president's re
form policies and to discourage future presidents
from daring to call to account powerful men.
While Mr. Cleveland was subjected to some crit
icism by men of his own party it seems that
never since the days of Andrew Johnson have
men dared to say, or newspapers dared to print
such bitter attacks upon the chief executive as
the things that are now being said and printed
by men who are hostile to Mr. Roosevelt. But
it must be remembered that it is not all hos
tility toward Mr. Roosevelt; part of it is due
to the deep concern which certain wealthy man
ipulators have in that system of lawlessness
which has been built up under the protection of
the very authority it defies and the perpetua
tion of this system depends upon a president
who will .either deliberately close his eyes to
tlie public- interest or become palsied with fear
in the presence of unscrupulous men.
THE WASHINGTON (D. C.) Star in its issue
of December 2, printed this editorial: "Mr.
Bryan's presence in town at the opening of con
gress, is entirely appropriate, and should be a
source of inspiration to every member of his
party. As the leader of his party, with another
nomination to the presidency most strongly fore
shadowed, his place is where the first guns of
the great battle are to be fired. Shells are to
be loaded here, and other material prepared
for the general engagement. Congress will be
a busy body, and it will be strange if the democ
racy, although in such a small minority in both
houses, does not manage to derive advantage
from some of the numerous discussions and di
visions. The opportunities will be well worth
the most careful watching, and when improvable
the- most complete improvement. Here, then, for
a few days at least, is the post of Importance,
and that post by every right is Mr. Bryan's. Mr.
Williams can not in reason object, because ho
is a Bryan man, and should welcome the sug
gestions of his leader about the larger ques
tions to come before the session. Nor, while
Mr. Bryan is less popular in democratic sena
torial circles than in house circles, is there any
good reason why any democratic senator should
hesitate to receive and profoundly consider any
points raised by the man who is, as the party's
leader, vitally interested in all matters of na
tional legislative moment. At the one end as
at the other of the capitol Mr. Bryan's party
welcome should be of the warmest. As an ad
viser Mr. Bryan is one of the frankest. Men
may differ about his wisdom, but no question
as, to his directness Is open. Ho means what
he says, and those who confer with him and
follow him are never in doubt about where ho
stands. This quality makes for confidence, and
Is the key to much of the influence he exerts.
THE HOLIDAY SEASON
Ho! the holiday season comes,
Piping cf bugles and roll of drums,
Eyes of morning and lips that shine
April back to these lips of mine!
Ho! the holiday season's here,
Flags and trumpet and songs of cheer;
Holly wreathed with the mistletoe,
Love'ri soft cheeks with the rose's glow;
Boyhood, girlhood, babehood sweet,
Ripple of laughter and ring of feot
Dancing down through the days of life
With love thrown over the wounds of strife'
And eyes so happy, and ltps all song,
'And grief forgotten where home-hearts throng.
