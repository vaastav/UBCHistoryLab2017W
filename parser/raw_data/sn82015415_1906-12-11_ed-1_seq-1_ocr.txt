"I think It would be well If labor
here wero paid a little bettor," said
United States Commissioner-General
of Immigration F. P. Sargent this
morning. "I see no reason why tho
plantations of Hawaii cannot offer bet
ter wages to their field labor.
"In regard to this projected Importa
tion of labor for Hawaiian plantations
from the Philippines, I believe that
Hawaii can get all the good
Immigration she needs from else
whero and all the labor she wants
without looking to the Philippine Isl
ands for assistance.
"Tho Philippines have their own de
velopment to look out for and their
own labor problems to solve and those
Islands need all they can get In the
way of good labor and probably do not
welcome tho Idea of Hawaii trying to
take away good labor. Besides, what
might prove to be very good labor In
the Philippines might not be so suit
able for Hawaii and, as 1 have already
said, there are other sources for Ha
waii to look to and we can get all the
good Europeans we want.
"If we want to build up Hawaii's
population In the right manner we
should not bo bothering with the Fili
pinos. Get Europeans and pay them
better wages than are now being offer
ed. It will pay the planters, and It will
pay tho Territory In the long run."

GENERAL OTIS WONDERS AS TO

OX PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE,
Major General Otis who arrived this
morning on the Nippon Maru showed the
greatest interest in regard to the Pre
sident's message especially that part of
It relating to tho Japanese. The Gen
eral is no great lover of the Japanese
and ho seemed to be worrying consider
ably this morning for fear that his paper,
The Los Angeles Times, would, as he
expressed it. "go off on the wrong foot."
lie dispatched several cablegrams and or
dered a number of papers so tlrat he
could get as closely in touch with the
situation as possible
''I do not think tiint the President can
ever make that proposition stick," said
tho General, "and I do not admire him
for the stnnd. I nm a friend of the Chi
nese but not the Japanese. There is all
of the difference in the world in the two
people. Tire Chinese are reliable and nro
good workers but the Japanese are not.
T do not agree with tho President on
that point and T shall not back him up.
"I am glad to note that tho coast
papers are severe in their criticism. They
should be and I hope that my paper stood
in witli them.

GENERAL OTIS DOES NOT THINK
MUOH OF THE FILIPINOS A3
LABORERS.
Major General Otis of Los Angeles
expressed the opinion this morning
that a mistake was being made In
bringing Filipinos here as laborers. He
stated that the Filipino Is not a good
laborer and thought that he would be
a failure In tho cane fields of Hawaii.
"The Filipino Is very lazy," said the
General, "and I do not think much
o- him as a laborer. He will not be of
much use to the planters here. I will
go even further than that and say that
he Is absolutely of no account.
"I do not see why tho Territory
should ramble about so In the bringing
of laborers here. From reports the
Portuguese make the best laborers and
'I do not seo why tho authorities here
do not concentrate upon one effort In
eettlnr the Rood laborers here. I feel
that the Filipinos will prove a failure."
Asked about 'present conditions In
the Philippines the General said: "As
far ns pacification Is concerned, of
course, conditions are Improved much
since I was there. But in agriculture
there has not been much done. Things
are not much bottor than they wero
whe,n the Americans first occupied tho
Islands.
"Tho thing which hurts matters
there is tho fact that tho prevailing
sentiment Is 'tho Philippines for the
Filipinos.' This keeps out much Amer
loan capital and hurts the development
of tho Islands.
"General Smith Is a very able Gov
ernor and he is doing much for the
country. He will glvo most of his at

suits and at the gnme tme keep order.
