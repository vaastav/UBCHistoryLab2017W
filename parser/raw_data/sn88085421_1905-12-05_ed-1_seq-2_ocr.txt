PRESIDENT S MESSAGE
DELIVERED TO CONGRESS
RECOMMENDATION ON CORPORATIONS
Beli ve> That They Can Be Regulated and Controlled
By Enactment of Proper Laws By Congress—
Touched Upon Insurance, Federal Election
Laws and Land Frauds.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 5, 1905 —
President's Roosevelt's message was
delivered to the two houses of con
gress today. Regulation of railroad
rates is made the most prominent feat
ure of the message. Federal regula
tion of insurance companies, purifica
tion of federal elections, reform in the
public land laws, restriction of immi
gration and labor problems come next
in importance. The message in part is
as follows:
To the Senate and House of Represent
atives: >
The people of this country continue
to enjoy great prosperity. Undoubt
edly there will be ebb and flow in such
prosperity, and this ebb and flow will
be felt more or less by all members of
the community, both by the deserving
and the undeserving. Against the
wratn of the Lord the wisdom of man
can not avail; in times of flood or
drought human ingenuity can but par
tially repair the disaster. A general
failure of crops would hurt all of us.
Again, if the folly of man mars the
general well-being, then those who are
innocent of the folly will have to pay
part of the penalty incurred by those
who are guilty of the folly. A panic
brought on by the speculative folly of
part of the business community would
hurt the whole business community.
But such stoppage of welfare, though
it might be severe, would not be last
ing. In the long run the one vital fac
tor in the permanent prosperity of the
country is the high individual charac
ter of the average American worker,
the average American citizen, no mat
ter whether his work be mental or
manual, whether he be farmer or wage
worker, business man or professional
man.
In our industrial and social system
the interests of all men are so closely
intertwined that in the immense ma
jority of cases a straight-dealing man
who by his efficiency, by his ingenuity
and industry, benefits himself must al
so benefit others. Normally the man
of great productive capacity who be
comes rich by guiding the labor of
many other men does so by enabling
them to produce more than they could
produce without his guidance; and
both he and they share in the benefit,
which comes also to the public at
large. The superficial fact that the
; sharing may be unequal must never
j blind us to the underlying fact that
j there is this sharing, and that the ben
| efit comes in some degree to each ma
! concerned. Normally the wage-worker,
the man of small means, and the aver
age consumer, as well as the average
producer, are all alike helped by mak
ing conditions such that the man ol
exceptional business ability receives
an exceptional reward for his ability.
I Something can be done by legislation to
J help the general prosperity; but no
i such help of a permanently beneficial
j character can be given to the less able
j and less fortunate, save as the result?
lof a policy which shall inure to the i
I advantage of all industrious and efii
[clent people who act decently; and this
j is only another way of saying that any
j benefit which comes to the less able
land less fortunate • must of
necessity come even more to the j
more able and more fortunate. If, there- j
fore, the less fortunate man is moved j
by envy of his more fortunate j
j brother to strike at the conditions un-]
j dor which they have both, thoueh un- '
: equally, prospered, the result will as
i suredly, be that while damage may
| come to the one struck at, it will visit
I with an even heavier load the one who
| strikes the blow. Taken as a whole we
! must all go up or go down together.
Corporations.
| Yet, while not merely admitting, but
j insisting upon this, it is also true that
j where there is no governmental re
straint or supervision some of the ex
ceptional men use their energies not In
ways that are for the common good,
but in ways which tell against this
common good. The fortunes amassed
through corporate organization are
now so large, and vest such power in
those that wield them, as to make it
a matter of necessity to give to the
sovereign—that is, to the government,
which represents the people as a whole
—some effective power of supervision
THE EVENING STATESMAN, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1905.
| over their corporate use. In order tc
insure a healthy social and industrial
life, every big corporation should be
held responsible by, and be accountable
to, some sovereign strong enough t(
control its conduct. I am in no sense
hostile to corporations. This is an age
of combination, and any effort to pre
vent all combination will be not only
useless, but .n the end vicious, be
cause of the contempt for law which
the failure to enforce law inevitably
produces. We should, moreover, re
cognize in cordial and ample fashion
the immense good effected by corpor
ate agencies in a country such as ours,
and the wealth of intellect, energy, and
fidelity devoted to their service, and
therefore normally to the service of
the public, by their officers and di
rectors. The corporation has come to
stay, just as the trade union has come
to stay. Each can do and has done
great good. Each should be favored so
long as it does good. But each should
be sharply checked where it acts j
against law and justice. '
So long as the finances of the nation
are kept upon an honest basis no other
question of internal economy with
which the congress has the power to
deal begins to approach in importance
the matter of endeavoring to secure
proper industrial conditions under
which the individuals—and especially
the great corporations—doing an inter
state business are to act. The makers
of our national constitution provided
especially that the regulation of inter
state commerce should come within the
sphere of the general government. The
arguments in favor of their making
this stand were even then overwhelm
ing. But they are far stronger today,
in view of the enormous development
of great business agencies, usually cor
porate in form. Experience has shown
conclusively that it is useless to try to
get any adequate regulation and su
pervision of these great corporations by
state action. Such regulation and su
pervision can only be effectively exer
cised by a sovereign whose jurisdiction
is coextensive with the field work of
the corporations—that is, by the na
tional government. I believe that this
regulation and supervision can be ob
tained by the enactment of law by the
congress. If this proves impossible, it
will certainly be necessary ultimately
to confer in fullest form such power
upon the national government by a
proper amendment of the constitution.
It would obviously be unwise to en
deavor to secure such an amendment
until it is certain that the result can
not be obtained under the constitution
as it now is. The laws of the congress
and of the several states hitherto, as
passed upon by the courts, have re
sulted more often in showing that th<
states have no power in the matter
than that the national government has
power; so that there at present exists
a very unfortunate condition of things,
under which these great corporation
doing an interstate business occupy the
position of subjects without a sover
eign, neither any state government nor
the national government having effect
ive control over them. Our steady aim
should be by legislations, cautiously
and carefully undertaken, but resolute
ly perserved in, to assert the sover
eignty of the national government by
affirmative action.
This is only in form an innovation. In
substance it is merely a restoration
for from the earliest time such reg
ulation of industrial activites has been
recognized in the action of the law
making bodies; and all that I propose
is to meet the changed conditions in
such manner as will prevent the com
monwealth abdicating the power it has
always possessed, not only in this
country but also in England before ani'
since this country became a separate
nation.
It has been a misfortune that the na
tional laws on this subject have hither
to been of a negative or prohibitive
hather than an affirmative kind, and
still more that they have in part sought
to prohibit what could not be effect
ively prohibited, and have in part in
their prohibitions confounded what
should be allowed and what should not
be allowed. It is generally useless to
try to prohibit all restraint on com-
petition, whether this restraint be rea
sonable or unreasonable; and where it
is not useless it is generally hurtful.
Events have shown that it is not possi
blt adequately to secure the enforce
ment of any law of this kind by inces
sant appeal to the courts. The de
partment of justice has for the last
four years devoted more attention to
the enforcement of the anti-trust legis
lation than to anything else. Much has
been accomplished; particularly mark
ed has been the moral effect of the
prosecutions; but it is increasingly ev
ident that there will be a very insuffi
cient beneficial result in the way of
economic change. The successful
prosecution of one device to evade the
i law immediately develops another de
vice to accomplish the same purpose.
"What is needed is not sweeping prohi
bition of every arrangement, good or
bad, which may tend to restrict compe
tition, but such adequate supervision
and regulation as will prevent any re
striction of competition from being to
the detriment of the public—as well as
such supervision and regulation as will
prevent other abuses in no way con
nected with restriction of competition.
Of these abuses, perhaps the chief,
although by no means the only one,
is overcapitalization—generally itself
the result of dishonest promotion—be-
cause of the myriad evils it brings in
its train; for such overcapitalization
often means an inflation that invites
business panic; it always conceals the
true relation of the profit earned to
the capital actually invested, and it
| creates a burden "of interest payment?
which is a fertile cause of improper re
duction in or limitation of wages; it
damages the small investor, dis
courages thrift, and encourages gambl
ing and speculation; while perhaps
worst of all is the trickiness and dis
honesty which it implies—for harm to
morals is worse than any possible
harm to material interests, and the
debauchery of politics and business by
great dishonest corporations is far
worse than any actual material evil
they do the public. Until the national
government obtains, in some manner
which the wisdom of the congress ma\
suggest, proper control over the big
corporations engaged in interstate
commerce—that is, over the great ma
jority of the big corporations—it will
be impossible to deal adequately with
these evils.
I am well aware of the difficulties
of the legislation that I am suggest
ing, and of the need of temperate and
cautious action in securing it. I
should emphatically protest against
improperly radical or hasty action. The
first thing to do is to deal with the
great corporations engaged in the
business of interstate transportation
As I said in my message of December
6, last, the immediate and most press
ing need, so far as legislation is con
cerned, is the enactment into law of
some scheme to secure to the agents
Of the government such supervision
and regulation of the rates charged b>
the railroads of the county engaged
in interstate traffic as shall summarily
and effectively prevent the imposition
of unjust or unreasonable rates. It
made include putting a complete stop
to rebates in every shape and form.
This power to regulate rates, like all
similar powers over the business
world, should be exercised with mod
eration, caution, and self-restraint;
but it should exist, so that it can be
effectively exercised when the need
arises.
The first consideration to be kept in
mind is that the power should be af
firmative and should be given to some
administrative body created by the
congress. If given to the present in
terstate commerce commission or to a
reorganized interstate commerce com
mission, such commission should be
made unequivocally administrative. I
do not believe in the government in
terfering with private business more
than is necessary. 1 do not believe in"
the government undertaking any work
which can with propriety be left in
private hands. But neither do I be
lieve in the government flinching from
overseeing any work when it becomes
evident that abuses are sure to ob
tain therein unless there is govern
mental supervision. It is not my
province to indicate the exact terms
of the law which should be enacted;
but I call the attention of the congress
to certain existing conditions with
which it is desirable to deal. In my
judgment the most important provi
sion which such law should contain is
that conferring upon some competent
administrative body the power to de
cile upon the case being brought be
fore it, whether a given rate pre
scribed by a railroad is reasonable and
just, and if it is found to be unrea
sonable and unjust, then, after full in
vestigation of the complaint, to pre
scribe the limit of rate beyond which
it shall not be lawful to go—the max
imum reasonable rate, as it is com
monly called —this decision to go into
effect within a reasonable time and to
obtain from thence onward, subject to
review by the courts. It sometimes
happens at present, not that a rate is
too high but that a favored shipper
