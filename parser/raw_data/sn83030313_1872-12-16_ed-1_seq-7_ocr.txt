Qg, therefore, pray. ~ ^
The Eer. Bishop Foster preached OS "Tha
Bible, Ita Age, Perfection and Unchangeable
?Mas." It is not only the oldest book, but It is
tthe only perfect book that was ever written.
It treats of subjects of the highest importance
and such aa no other book treats, and in a
manner that inspires men with the fullest
confidence in ita sublime truths. Dr.
? Cheever maintains that prayer is not an ex
periment to be tested in the hospital or on the
farm, hat ia the law and the necessity of
spiritual life, and the soul that denies prayer
lis on the certain road to atheism. Dr. Morgan
Dix finds that the people of this world live in
?trot two houses?the house of feasting or the
house of mourning. This earth ia a house of
mourning, and all the fair things of life flourish
? on the surface of death. The house of mourn
ing holds the greater part of mankind. The
house of feasting is that whose inhabitants,
though comparatively few, say, "Let us eat
and drink, for to-morrow we die." In view of
the advent Dr. Dix urged his hearers to spend
more time in the house of mourning than in
?that of feasting.
Remnants of anything are very suggestive,
?but "remnants of society" are highly so ; and.
. JMr. Beocher deemed them worthy of his con
. sideration yesterday. The men who give them
. selves for others in a less sublime sense than
>-Christ gave Himself for -mankind, but not tha
less heroic?the men who want the stimulus
? of hope that gives fibre to the body?the men
> who have no adaptation, who put a yoke of
? oxen to rock the cradle and put the nurse's
. Jfoot to plough with?those are the remnants
? of society for whom God cares. Mr. Beecher
? would despair if all the men in this world
<who fall in the battle of life had no God to
? take care of them in the world to come. But
< he is glad to know, and so are we, that the
? spirit ot Christ is not to ble<s those only who
-sucoeed, but those who fail here also.
Rev. Dr. Tiflany, talking tp the politicians
? of Washington, urged them to be followers of
?God as dear children. He presented the
? characteristics and qualifications of children
as examples to follow. He was glad that as the
world and the Church advance the narrowness
?of sectarian bigotry gives way to the broad,
.'kindly Christlinesi which makes every man
?our neighbor who needs our help.
(president Grant and the James River
and Kanawha Canal.
The Virginians, taking advantage of the op
portunity afforded by the President's recom
-inendation of internal improvements in his
Hate Message to Congress, are moving in the
.matter of tho James River and Kanawha Canal.
It will be remembered that the President made
special reference to this canal as one of the
itnost important works of internal improve
i ments to develop trade between the West and
1 the Atlantic seaboard, and recommended Con
gross to aid in completing and making it
?Effective. Immediately after the President's
'Message was delivered Governor Walker, of
'Virginia, sent his Message to the State Legisla
ture, and in that rather threw cold water
?upon the proposal of federal aid, upon the
. grouud that he did not believe Congress
?would afford rolief and that the State ought to
rtiolp the work itself and not look for assist
ance from the federal government. The Vir
ginians, however, appear to be determined to
i urge Congressional action, and for that pur
pose a delegation from both Virginia and
West Virginia have had an interview with
! the President. Tho address made to him on
, that occasion and his reply have been pub
lished among our' Washington despatches.
The President reiterated his expressions in
favor of governmental aid and the hope that
"Congress will give sufficient encouragement
rto insure the completion of the work." Now,
<-while we agree with all that has been said of
the importance of opening canal communica
ition through Virginia to facilitate trade
i between the West and the seaboard, and of the
; .great value of tho work to both Virginia and
'-West Virginia, wo must say that the appro
i ^nation of money by the federal government
i for it would be the commencement of a most
disastrous policy. It would prove but the
t beginning of a system of internal hnprove
? ments on a gigantic scale that would in time
swamp the government, keep the people over
? burdened with taxation and spread the curse
: Df corruption and demoralization all over the
i laud. We think the Virginians had better
i take the advice of Governor Walker and do
? the work themselves, with the assistance of
? capital from private or State sources, and
neither appeal to nor trust to the action of the
. federal government.
Disastrous Fihes?Can the Magnetic
Telegraph be More Utilized ??The terrible
sweeping conflagrations in Boston and Chicago,
and many other disastrous fires of late, have
raised a great deal of discussion on the subject
of preventing, to some extent at least, such
disasters. There is one agent of great efficiency
that has not yet received due consideration in
connection with this subject. We refer to the
tnagnetio telegraph. While we arc not pre
pared to say in what way science may apply or
> ntilize this agent, it seems to us that it could
? be made to give instant alarm of the presence
of fire in a house both to the residents and to
the whole Fire Department. The magnetic
telegraph is exceedingly sensitive, and might
be made to act, by an unusual degree of heat
at any time, so as to give of itself and without
liandling an alarm of fire instantly, if suitable
instruments and connections of wire were
' provided. We raise the question for the con
sideration of scientific men and the Fire
Department
The St. Louis Republican (liberal demo
crat) says the democratic party has not a
.particle more strength, in a national point
of view, than it bad at the close of the Presi
dential election of 1868; that essentially
there is vsr- little difference in the present
political views of Mr. Thurman, the straight
out democratio Senator, and those of Carl
Schurz, the republican, who declares he can
not consent to be classed with democrats;
and that the problem for the leaders of the
politicians is to combine this opposition so
ori to make it as effectual in "warring upon"
as it is conspicuous in being "warred
against." Iu short, in order to make the
combined opposition formidable, the only
thing necessary?according to tho Republi
cin?is "a name." There iH something in a
name, thou, after all. But whether the rank
and C'n of the democracy will "smell as
sweet" by any other name is a qu(wtioM f>r

Prafcinr Ty?UUllV tor Original
Science?HU LwlpM^ "Light."
On Thursday last Profaesor Tjndall closed
his Washington lecture* within eloquent and
powerful plea for the sustentaMoa of iflriginal
scientific research.". No man on ^ithcr side
the Atlantio has done more to make science
practical and to bring its wealth of profound
acquisition within reach of the humblest and
most unscientific classes. With the true
greatness which condescends to men of low
estate he has turned aside from that brilliant
career of investigation in the domain of
radiant forces and molecular physics in which
he is a pioneer to perform the work of a
lecturer and teacher. No man, therefore, has
a better right to know or to plead for that
large class of sciontifio laborers who, with
infinite experimental pains, pursue their pa
tient oourse unnoticed and unoheered and
often derided, and who, while their follow
scientists are sleeping, are themselvos
toiling upwards In the dark.
The argument of Professor Tyndall is that
the noble volume of modern science, when
traced back towards former gges, is discovered
to- be the outflow from the gonitis-of a few
such men, who, like Newton, Arago and
Thomas Young, worked solely from the love
of truth, and who never reoeived a dollar's
profit from their splendid discoveries. Cut
off the oorps of original investigators and you
dry up the stream of practical soienoe, he
says, as Buroly as you would that of a river by
sealing up its fountains. Never was this
strong and sensible assertion more timely
than in the presont ago of busy and restless
practicality, and it is not without peculiar im
port in the United States, although uttered
in the high tide or golden era of technioal
education and in the heydey of our colleges
and univorsities. The history of all scientific
advance shows that it has been carried for
ward, not by men taught and trained to sit at
the feet of tho great Gamaliels of knowledge
and to become the receptive magazines of
their dicta, but by men who penetrated the
very wilds and trackless wastes of nature in
courageous loneliness; who have had to brave
the imperious authority of the existing priest
hood of scicnco, and who found at last only
By dangerous roads
A path to perpetuity of fame.
These aro the men for whom tho groat Eng
liKh lecturer sympathetically and strongly ap
peals, and his appeal Bhould not be made in
vain. If the great Republic is to take rank
with the highest oi?ilizations in the develop
ment of science, and wipe off the charge of
De Tocqucvillo, that ropublics aro incapablo of
great progress in original scientific research
and great discoveries, it is evident that such
men as these must be encouraged in their
arduous and trying labors. We have not a few
such earnest men scattered over the country,
and men who, with the limited means of in
quiry placed before them, have evinced great
capacity. As Professor Tyndall, however, has
remarked, they aro generally burdened with
the routine duties and details of tuition or
official labor in the practical service of tho
public, and have but the smallest fragment of
time left them for the prosecution of their
proper calling. Our scientific departments in
the government are similarly crowded with
the ordinary public business, which concerns
tho every-day and matter-of-fact interest oi the
whole nation and cannot sately brook delay,
so that but little opportunity is affjrded
for tho purely experimental and contemplative
study of natural phenomena. This, perhaps,
is just what a largo claf.3 of so-called "practi
cal men" would have it. But time will show
their error, as it has so often done before.
Whether Professor Tyndall's appeal penetrates
the minds and enlists the sympathy of those
who reach the mainsprings ol public opinion
and who are in position to further his views or
not, he will have discharged a high and noblo
mission for true science and sown seed which
will ultimately bring forth a golden harvest.
Possibly there could be no better time than
this, when his powerful plea is sounding all
over America and the popular mind is tossing
with his great themes, to push forward the
long-agitated proposition for a National Physi
cal Observatory, designed for the exclusive
object of original research in the vast fields of
solar, cosmical and terrestrial phenomena, and
unembarrassed by the wearing and wasting
routine of public business. This plan, so ably
supported by the distinguished Secretary of '
tho Smithsonian Institution, the friend of
Professor Tyndall, would be another and per
haps an improved edition of the Royal Insti
tution of England, which has proved the nur
sery of philosophers and scientific discoverers.
The suggestion is worthy of national attention,
and if put into execution would meet one of
the profoundest needs of American science.
It would be a deserved complimont to the
great successor of Faraday, now in our midBt,
and a fitting acknowledgment of our deep
appreciation of his mission, to crown it with
the erection and munificent endowment of
such a beneficent institution.
In the same connection, and by way of en
forcing the argument we have already ad
vanced, we call attention to Professor Tyn
dall' s lectures in this city, which begin to
morrow evening. The first lecture is a
general introduction to the course, dwelling
principally upon tho importance of original
inquiry, and explaining the instruments of
science and the principles upon which they
depend. In the second lecture tho demon
strated constitution of light is applied to the
doctrine of colors, and spectrum analysis is
copiously illustrated. The third lecture deals
with solar light, the reciprocity of radiation
and absorption and the extension of the spec
trum beyond its visible range. In the fourth
lecture he explains the faculty and method of
scientific investigation, and in the fifth the
phenomenon of crystallization. The sixth
lecture, which finishes the course, is devoted
to the further illustration of tho action of
crystals upon light, and concludes with an
explanation of the magnetization of light
The whole series is one of great importance,
and is rendered exceedingly interesting by
Professor Tyndall's experiments and illustra
tions. It is said that Boston was disgusted
with the diaHnguished lecturer because ho
made overything he touched so plain that all his
hearers could understand him. This will
prove a great pleasure to his New York
auditors, many of whom will be mechanics
with a love of scientific investigation. In the
I f?cts of Frofossor Tyndall's simplicity of
fi'iccch and clearness of illustrMiou we liavo
I the proajjw of tho most ex^e'ilcut results.

Rome, the original property of such houses, may
be maintained, but cannot be increased, and the
will not enjoy civil rights.
The property of the suppressed corporations wilt

SUDDEN DEATH OF KENSETT, THE ARTIST.
His Early Tean-Hia Career and His End-A
Great Landscape Painter Gone.
Another name hu to be added to the long list of
distinguished men who, after lives of toil and use
fulness, have suddonly passed away. Scarcely has
the literary public recovered from the shock caused
by the announcement of the death of the great
tragedian Bdwln Forrest, when tt is again startled
by the Md new* that the artlat John Frederick
Kensett, whose works aa a landscape painter have
delighted the thousand lovers or art, both In hla
native country tnd foreign lands, had on .Saturday
been unexpectedly called to hla account. Mr.
Rousett had siuco November been suffer
ing from pneumonfa, but for tho past
few weeks he had gained so much in strength that
hu friends fondly hoped he bad fully recovered.
Hia death has, therefore, come so unexpectedly
that his associates, to whom he was endeared by
many ties, ore grief-stricken at tho unlooked-for
bcioavement. On Saturday morning ho was at
hla studio, to all outward appearance In tnc enjoy
ment of good health. 80 confident were his frleuds
that tho dangerous symptoms of bis disease, bad
passed that Mrs. Hicks, wlfo of the portrait
painter, who was the friend of the dead artist and
who was unremitting In her atttuMon to him dur
ing his iimcss, felt so conllcleut of his couvales
conce that she left tho city with her
husbaud to be absent ovor the Sunday,
lie was In the habit of partaking of a alight lunch
every day at abuvt half-past one o'clock, and on
Saturday ho seut Mie boy, according t<r custom, to
bring in the meal. The Itoy returned ih a few min
utes with the lunch; aud placed It. close to Mr. Ken
sett's table. The artist was sitting in his eitsy
chair looking deathly white, which su alarmed t'ie
boy that ho instantly ran for assistance, returning
with the Janltor'a wtfe. While the assistance
was being brought Kcnsctt arose froui the
easy chair 011 which he wns silting aud staggered
to tho lonngc. He lay in such a position
upon the lounge thnu when tho hoy nnil
the janltor'a wife entered the apartment
they wero seriously alarmed, and medical
aid was at ouce sent for. A doctor arrived
in a short time, and, after examluing the artist, pro
nounced hint dead of heart diaease. When the
news 01 the aad event spread, the artists, who
hud known the dead man lor years, hastened to the
studio. The secretary ol the Academy of Design,
J. Addison Uichards, William Huntingdon, William
Hart, the landscape painter, and a few others, col
lected around the sola, and thoir tears treely flowed
In contemplating all that remained of the Irietid
who in life they nad so dearly loved. A messenger
was sent with the intelligence to Mr. K. M. Oly
phaut, of this city, who had been for years
tho artist's patron, and It la believed
he will see that the funeral arrange
ments are befltting the artist and the
man. In couaequenee of the day being Saturday
the studios of the artists woio open to then
friends, aud many visitors who came to Mr. Ken
sctt's room, expecting to lind him at work, were
met with the news of hia dcuth. Tho tender and
loving nature of the man, hla large-hearted gene
rosity, his kindness to hia juniors and hia just ap
preciation of the merits of the artista of hia own
standing had so endeared him to his iriends that
the task or breaking the news of lila dcatU to
strangers was an exceedingly painlul one.
Joun Frederick Kensett was born In Cheshire,
Conn., on the 32d day of March, 1818, so that he

Ilia parents were reapectable people, an uncle
of hia being Alfred Daggett, widely cele
brated at the time aa an engraver or bank uote
viirnettes. At an early aire Kensett was annren
tlced to his uncle, and tor a time worked steadily,
but his aspiration soared higher than the en
graver's art; he had sot his soul upon being a
painter. Ilis leisure time was spent in the Btudy
01 oil colors; and so enamored had he become of
this urt that, at the age of twenty-two, we And
him in England engaged in study paint.ng, with a
wish to adopt it as his future profession. He first
commenced in London, and while there he made
tho acquaintance of several young artists who af
terwards bcc&ine famous, among them Durand and
Casilear. He supported hlinseir by engraving for
five years, during which he was unremit
ting in the endeavor to acquire a per
iod knowledge of oil painting. At the
end ol Uie live years Ills first work, a view 01
Windsor castle, was exhibited at the rooms of the
Society of British Artists, Sufioik street. This wus
the turning point in the youug artist's career and
his first genuine success in his beloved art. It was,
ami still Is, the custom in this association to an
nually hold a lottery at a guluea a head. There ,
tire two lucky numbers, the winners of which
arc allowed to choose a picture as a prize,
on the occasion on which Kensett exhibited,
his picture was chosen by the winner of the
first lucky prize. Tho choice was universally
applau led, as the picture, among many
beautiful ones, was the most beautiful of
tnem all. 80 soft and tender was it in
Its coloring, so delicate tn its composition
and ho finished in its design that it
attracted universal admiration and a brilliant
future was predicted lor the young American by
the critics. With the price received for the
picture Kensett left England in search of subjects
for his pencil, which Kngland, generous as it was
in Its appreciation of him. could not afTord. Ilis
iiiinil had long been set upon a visit to Italy, tho
laud inseparably associated with art and poetry,
the Mecca to which the painters or all lands and
all schools turn their longing eyes. Here his
geulim took a higher (light than it had hitherto
douo. He sketched along tho beautiful Italian
lakes and dreamed of art in gondolas, in the
romantic city of tho sea, whose marble
palaccs and poetical villas have furnished
themes for many a fertile pen. Coino and
Magglore realized Ills most sanguine expectations,
and he left Italy with a rich portfolio of subjects,
with his talents enlarged and quickened and his
heart beating high with hope. He went from Italy
to Switzerland and Germany, crossing over the
Alps on his way. "The cloud-cappea hills" en
larged his love for the grand and the beautiful. In
Italy he had been touched with the softer beanty
ol nature, but here she asserted herself in all her
sublimity, and the artist's soul was touched as it
nover had been before. At the conclusion or hi s
tour he settled down in Rome and set himself in
earnest to work. In 1848 his landscape, "View of
the Arno" and a sketch entitled "The .Shrine" was
scut to the Academy of Design. The suc
cess of the two worts was complete. Criti
cism was silent, except to praise the pictures;
envy was disarmed, and the artists recognized
Kensett as the future star of t,tie profession. By
a unanimous vote he was elected Associate of tho
Academy, and the next year he was made Acade*
mlcian. He returned to New York. His return
was hailed with delight, and his first works?views
of tho mountain and river scenery of New York
and the Eastern States?were speedily purchased
and lavishly praised. From that time up to his
d*ath be has painted unremittingly his favorite
subjects, lake and river views, and in his own
department he has rarely been excelled. In the
Fall of 1H88 he returned to New York with a large
number of sketches from Lake George and Lake
Champlain, along with some views of the Atlantic
coast, and the Long Island coast, near Darlcn,
where he had a Summer studio. A large painting
of Lake George, "Near tho Narrows," with Black
Mountain in the distance and little islands on the
leit, the sky a little-overcast and the sun "drawing
water;" a broad view near Burlington, with Mont
Mansfield in the distance, and an old-fashioned red
rarrn house and barnraFd, standing out In all their
bareness. Thsee, with several other paintings, were
executed at this time, attracting universal atten
tion and admiration. In tne following year, I8?t?,
he was appointed a member of the National Art
Commission, organized to oversee the work of
beautifying the national Capitol. His time since,
when not interrupted l?y Illness, has been
spent In earnest study. He was an en
thusiastic devotee of his art, an ear
nest and faithful worker and a loviug
and constant friend. The shaft of malice, recklessly
as It is sometimes aimed, and unsparing as it Is of
reputations, never assailed Kensett, as It could
find no opening for attack In a nature so generous,
spotless and pure. His friend and partner sUictf
lus return to New York has been Mr. R. M. Oly
phant, but there are few collections of value that
do not contain specimens of his works.
The style of Kensett was characteristic of the
man. With the grand and the terrible spectacles
of nalure his soul was not in unison. The tempest
and the storm, the ocean rocking itself tn Its wild
fury, or the rage of the elements, delighted hlxn
not. His spirit was eminently pastoral,
and at no time did he feel so. happy
as when sketcning some quiet view of
the sea coast of his own belowed country. Views
of farm 11/e, the sea when at rest, the bubbling of
some lonely brook and the loneliness of the set
ting Summer's son have all been worthily treated
by his pencil, and though he has loft the more
lofty flights of has art to the more ambitious he
will always be remembered as a man who excelled
in whatever he undertook, and will hold an endnr
ln* place among, the grest landscape painters
which the last century has produced.
The funeral will take place from the Fifth a ve
nire Presbyterian ohurcn, corner of Nineteenth
street, on Wednesday, tho 19th Instant, at one
o'clock P. M. A large gathering of artists and
members of the literary circles in whloh the de
ceased moved are oxpeoted to follow his remain*
to tho grave.
