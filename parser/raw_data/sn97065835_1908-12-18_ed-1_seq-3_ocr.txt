NEW YORK FASHION LETTER.
Ideas for Women from the Center of
American Fashions.
(By Catherine Mann Payzant.)
New York, Dec. 11.—As the cold
er weather approaches the woman
naturally turns towards the idea of
new furs. In addition to its comfort
nothing will give a costume more el
egant and sumptuous appearance
than a fur garment or trimming
fur.
Thene are few new furs this sea
eon except the silvered lynx and
Pointed fox. The first of these is
very like the silvered fox that was
so fashionable last season. it is
a soft, lustrous black flecked with
white, as though Mr. Lynx had just
come out of a snow flurry. The
pointed fox is a beautiful deep brown
and has also hair tips of white.
Baby lamb, caracul and astrakan
are still as well liked as formerly, al
though they have had a vogue of
•three years. Many coats will be
made from these garments, especi
ally the long garments, for the man
ufacturers have now found processes
by which these pelts may be made
very light as well as keep their
warmth. One would suppose that
fur was elegant enough in itself not
to need any decoration, but the 'fash
ions of the day justifies the ad
dition of braid, fancy buttons, velvet
inserts and straps of silk or velvet.
To tell the truth, although the meth
od 'has the sanction of fashion, it
spoils the beauty of the pelts to thus
cover them over with other mater
ials. Nothing is so beautiful as a
long coat of some fine fur made with
graceful lines and fine finish depend
ing wholly upon its own beauty.
Long Oiaired furs are being made
up into long coats to a large extent
this winter. For the half-fitting,
half length coats, sable, mink, chin
chilla, and the new fox skins are
used. Sealskin has again came in
to its own, and of the furs none have
more elegance or richness than the
sealskin. Unfortunately the seal
skin is almost too heavy for the
long coat, although they are worn
in reality, the imitation seal is light
er and better fur for the long coat.
But for the muff, collar, or short
coat, or as a trimming, sealskin has
a place of its own and with care it
will last for years, better than any
other fur.
Mink still continues to keep its
•place on the list of modish furs,
some lovely garments are made from
this fur. .A half-fitted coat was de
veloped fnom .this skin and fastened
with big jeweled buttons The neck
was finished with one pair of new
ruffs of satin overlaid with lace and
a narrow piece of fur in the enter.
Often to gain the shortwaisted effect
now so popular, the markings of the
skins are so ,arranged that the lines
shall run down to the bust in long
lines, and the skirt portion of the
coat has the .lines going in the op
posite direction. Some times the or
der is reversed.
The little satin lace and fur ruff
are extremely well liked just at pres
ent and during the cold weather are
worn more than a very heavy piece.
Caracul was used to develop a di
rectoire coat. Below the revers' were
large buttons covered with fur. A
black liberty satin tie was an at
tractive addition to this stylish coat.
At the throat was a large and hand
some gold buckle.
Pur capes, some made in fichu
style are much worn at present. One,
an evening wrap of ermine, fell in
long graceful lines both front and
back and was gathered in a point
at the waist line from which point
fell four or five long tails. For car
riage wear, a similar wrap might be
made in the more heavy furs.
A Directoire coat, rather shorter
than is usual in this model, was made
of broadtail and lined with a silk
having a tapestry pattern, and the
same silk'mounted on a heavy foun
dation was used for the vest. Passem
enterie decorated the. fronts below
the revers, and. the points of the
turned-back cuffs..
iThe Directoire Influence is tl\|e
most pronounced feature in the cut
of all the .new furs, especially for
those intended for the street. The
•high Directoire collar, Incroyable
revers, pointed cuffs and patch pock
ets, and an amount of gift trimming,
bring .the period back in all its glory.
A great deal of braid is seen on
the edges,of the new coats as well as
decorating its flat surfaces.
Self-toned linings are best liked at
the present moment, but for an even
ing wrap,, to be worn over a ligat
dress, to disobey the dictates of fish
ioin is the better judgment. When
a self-toned lining is used the facing
on the inside of the fronts are often
very ornate, with a similar line of
trimming seen on the outside, as it
were not enough to cover the out
side but that this love for over-or
namentation has crept to the lining
also.
The pererine and shawl wraps are
favorites just now for ermine and
the flat surface furs, while caracul
and lamb are used most for the long,
loose straight-backed coats trimmed
•with much soutache braid. Velvet
and bl^ck fox coats are going to b°
worn
1
'There may be the coat of
fur -frith. velvet accessories, or th"
coat may be of velvet with huge col
lar cuffs and trimmings rf velvft. A
muff of ftix should accompany, the
coat.'
The idea of combini"? two or more
furs is still prevalent, and if good
-taste is used and on'v two furs, the
effect is -wonderfully rich in con
trast. For instance, an ermine stole
of ermine was edged with sealskin
and-the dark brown rich surface, of
the seal sets off the white fur to p-r
fection, giving it a warm glow not itr
ownby reflection.
^'he"collars "and stoles all show
long lines, except in the .case of the
littlg juffs. Pains are taken in the
stoles and collars that the marking
of the. fur shall carry out the idea
andVun up and down, and great care
Is «Iso taken to show- off the natural,
markings to the beat advantage. It
is supposed to be the hall mark of
the real article, which is after all a
fallacy, like many other such notions*
Muffs are large and will cover the
whole front of the skirt, but the fur
is so light nowadays that they are
not so cumbersome and heavy as
one would suppose them to be. A
great many of the muffs are now
lined with a second fur, as a sealskin
with ermine or a brown fox with
chinchilla.
A pretty muff seen on the boule
vard the other day was a handsome
whole skin of sable, but the real muff
through which the hands were passed
was of shirred chiffon exactly
matohing the sable fur, and over
this inner muff the skin had appar
ently been thrown.
Fur is used even on the sheerest
materials. A net over-dress, for in
stance, will be edged with a narrow
banding of sable, ermine or mink.
Care must be taken to get the right
shade for there are many shades in
the same variety of fur. Thus sable
is found in many styles and shades,
according to the part of the world it
is brought from. Fox is another in
stance of this different shading and
marking.
lOpossum fur is one of the warmest
and richest, and withal, a cheaper
fur and therefore one that the buyer
with a limited amount should choose
iMoleskin is much used for half
long coats. It is a pretty fur for
trimming, or any small article.
The medium-sized muffs are as
lavishly trimmed as ever, with paws
and heads and tails. Ermine tails
are used in the most reckless man
ner just as one would use tassels or
pendants. They are especially pret
ty to make the now fashionable lit
tle ruffs for the neck when laid
against a black or dark shade of
color
The fashion that has found favor
for so many years of using two or
more skins with the heads fastened
together in the back and then left to
fall straight in the front, is still
popular.
For long coats of cloth, where ad
ditional warmth is required, cony
and squirrel, which are not too ex
pensive, are frequently used. For
such coats and wraps when intended
for evening wear, ermine is the best
liked fur, if one can stand the ex
pense, for ermin is by 110 means a
cheap fur.
Many cloths that resemble and are
called after certain furs will be used
for all sorts of coats and wraps this
season, and some of them are real'y
preferable to a fur. A handsome
broadcloth skirt made in Directoire
style, with a half long coat of cara
cul having the finishing character
istics of the Directoire coat, though
not' so long, will be often seen this
win ter.
Advertise the State.
The coming session of the legisla
ture is going to be asked to appro
priate $25,000 for the next two
years to stimulate immigration to
South Dakota. The Argus-Leader
hopes that the Legislature will be
big enough to do this. South Da
kota needs boosting which comes
from systematic advertising work,
and if we are to get our fair share
of new people who are coming west
ward seeking homes, it is none too
early to begin.
South Dakota is one of the great
est states in the union, but no body
knows it outside of South Dakota.
North Dakota is spending $40,000
a year to secure new settlers and our
northern sister is getting them.
Canada is spending large sums in
this line of work, and with resour
ces and climate inferior to ours is
each year getting 50,000 citizens
from the United States. This is an
age of advertising, and the states
which pursue the tight-fisted policy
are not those who do the growing.
This state needs a real immigra
tion department. It needs systemat
ic advertising but this costs money.
And there must be some way pro
vided to meet the cost. The whole
state benefits by it when new set
tlers come, and hence the whole
state should pay the cost. Twenty
five thousand dollars is a small sum
when distributed among half a mil
lion people, and if wisely used it
will be certain to bring big results.
A state needs to advertise as much
if not more than a business man.
Let the whole world know about
our great crops. Let it be stated
that consecutively for the last six
years the state has produced the
largest per capita of new wealth of
any state-in the union. Let outside
people know that there are millions
of acres of cheap land for sale from
which great crops can be raised.
Let them understand the possibil
ities of manufacturing and whole
sale trade. South Dakota is highly
favored but it will not grow fast un
til some serious effort is made to
'iring in new people and new cap
ital.—Argus-Leader.
What the Panama Report Shows.
The fourth annual report of the
Panama canal commission apparent
ly confirms previous estimates as to
the time required to construct a
lock canal, contradicts the earlier
.'predictions as to the total cost, and
leaves us at the threshold of one of
the most difficult parts of the enter
prise—the construction of the dam
and locks at Gatum.
Engineers agree that the exca
vation of the great Culebra section
furnishes the measure of time neces
sary to finish the undertaking Just
as the speed of the slowest ship is
the speed of the fleet, so the portion
of a work requiring the longest
time for completion fixes the date
for the end of the whole enterprise.
The report shows that for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1908,
12,064,138 cubic yards of earth were
removed from Culebera. As the min
ority of the board of consulting en
gineers, 'whose report was adopted
by the government, put the total
number of yards to be removed at
53,765,000, it is evident that four
more years, at the present rate, will
suffice to finish the Culebra cut.
It has been generally predicted
that the lock canal wil require about
eight years to build. And should
the Culebra excavation be finished
in 1912, as the commission indi
cates, and as the rate of excavation
suggests, these predictions will have
been justified.
During the fiscal year the total
expenditures amounted to $29,500,
000. Of this $1S,062,000 may be
roughly classed as construction work,
$3,500,000 went for «new dredging
machinery, and $8,000,000 for other
outlays. Four more years at this
rate and the expenses of the last
five years of 'the enterprise will lie
much greater than the earlier esti
mates of the entire cost of the canal.
These estimates ranged from
that of the minority of the board of
consultinging engineers, which was
$116,000,000 plus 20 per cent for
administration and contingincies—
not including interest, sanitation, or
'expenses of zone government—lto|
that of the commission confirmed
March, 3, 1904, which was $144,
233,35S.
Congress, by the act of June 2S,
1902, put 011 record the opinion that
$145,000,000 would suffice, and ap
propriated $10,000,000 of that
amount.
Five times the amount expended
this year will exceed the highest of
these totals. If to the product we
add the amount spent in the pre
vious three years we bave a sum
vastly in excess of what any one
contemplated when the Panama rev
olution of 1903 .made the construc
tion of the canal across the isthmus
a certainty. And if the reader will
'trouble himself to remember the
$50,000,000 which was spent before
a spade of dirt was thrown, the grand
total of national expenditure! for
which the enterprise will stand be
comes almost stupendous.
It might also be kept in mind
that the annual expenses for the
next four years, while they could
hardly be less than for 1907-8, might
conceivably be a great deal more
and that would operate still further
to swell the total In the present re
port we see such items as $3,500,
000 for new machinery in one year.
What will the item of material
'mount to during the year when the
immense mases of steel and iron ne
'essary for locks, gates, etc., have to
'te provided)? Moreovier will not
'he difficulties of excavation in Cule
ira be greater the lower the shovel
goes?
The engineers favoring a sea-level
canal figured that the last excava
tions would be more difficult, because
of smaller space and greater trou
ble to dispose of the dirt and rock,
and this factor may also enter into
the work on the local canal.
The delays due to landslides, high
waters, and other causes are doubt
less such as might nave been expect
ed. From what the report says, it
is a fair inference that the commis
sion does not regard these natural
and antagonistic forces as in any
way impelling the eventful success of
the enterprise.—Argus Leader.
Tramps and Tramps Royal.
The tramp is a much-abused per
son. Not too much abused, for he
deserves it, but in talking of the
uselessness of the menace of the
tramp the real significance of his
existence is forgotten. The com
mon tramp is the camp-follower of
the tramp royal, and to the tramp
royal the world owes its discoveries.
Ahead of the church, the law and
the crowd skirmishers ever the
tramp royal. He builds nothing, he
cuts no path through the jungle,
but he shows the way and then
moves elsewhere to show another
way.
Tramps royal are the scouts of
'the army that never was listed."
Great-hearted, immoral, restless ad
venturers, to whom the whole wond
is a home and who have not habita
tion otherwise, they seek ever some
new place or people, search in some
new spot for the pot of gold at the
rainbow's end.
That they never find it doesn't
matter they show the way for the
spread of civilization. Driven .h|y
insatiable unrest, they penetrate be
yond the frontier and into the wil
derness. They do not care for heat
or famine or thirst, only the seek
ing. Should they realize their
heart's desire, it would turn to ashes
in their hands and the search would
begin anew. They break no paths,
but they go where later the paths
follow.
To them the world owes all its
newer lands. Of them were De
Snto, Ponce de Leon, Columbus, the
Cabots, Drake and Captains Smith,
Andre and Stanley, Daniel Boone
and Davy Crockett. They stifle in
the sight of the civilization they
have made possible, and push ahead
to make more civilization possible.
There is no purpose in their roam
ings but the desire to roam, yet
purposeless as they seem, the results
are beyond calculation.
Let us by all means kick the
tramp all we think he needs, but
let us mitigate the severity of the
kick, because the tramp is a sort
of seventeenth cousin to the tramp
royal.—Ex.
Regrassing the Ranges
Is one of the most important
things being taken up by our gov
ernment today. It is all well enough
to talk about the passing of the
range, the coming of the small far
mer, and all that, but at least two
thirds of Colorado and Montana,
Wyoming and a very large area of
the Dakotas will never be farm land
never anything but range, and the
mission of much of the possible
farming land scattered thinly
through these parts will be to grow
winter forage for stock that gets
most of its living from the drouth re
sisting glasses that are natural to
these unfavorable lands.
It will be found that these dry
pastures cannot be so carelessly pas
tured as in the past, and other than
buffalo grass may be introduced in
many parts to help out thia old reli­
able dry land pasture but iu our
judgment buffalo grass will continue
to be an important factor in making
the poorest parts of these semi-arid
parts valuable.
In this connection the following
from A. Buchanan, an old Colorado
rancher, in Denver Field and Farm,
is of interest:
I have been 011 the ranges of
'eastern Colorado since 1SS2 and
have been a close observer. I am
willing to give the agriculturalists
the full measure of credit for the
great work they have done in stim
ulating farm study up to its present
strenuous gait.
But, I think it is a mistaken
claim that the small farmer is going
to eventually occupy all of these
great prairies and put the range bus
iness in the list of romances of the
past. Vast as is the agricultural
area of Colorado east of the Rockies,
I think that not more than one-third
of it can ever be successfully farmed
either by irrigation or by the dry
farming process. I think two-thirds
of this great area -is out of the
•ranch of irrigation and also unfitted
for dry farming. It must forever
remain a stock country and you can
call it range, ranch or invent some
scientific trade mark for it.
"The other day I read an article,
the burden of which was the reseed
ing of the range and one of the. poet
ic laments was that the natural
grass, the buffalo sod that once
formed an unbroken carpet from the
Missouri river to the Rocky moun
tains and from boundary to bound
ary of the United States in a north
erly and southerly direction, when
once disturbed could never be re
placed. Plow it up, tramp it out,
or pasture, it too closely and it was
gone forever, according to the pro
fessor.
"Now it is not my experience that
it is impossible to resod the prairie
with buffalo grass. I can take you
to sections that were plowed up dur
ing the wheat craze of years ago,
abandoned after two or three sea
sons of failure and they are now
grown over with buffalo sod.
"The same is true of range dis
tricts that were closely pastured
down and during the excessive dry
years along in the nineties became
practically denuded of grass. By
keeping stock off these districts a
year or so of normal moisture even
for this country has brought the
buffalo grass pasturage back to as
good condition as it ever knew.
There is a whole lot of this western
country that will never make any
thing but range land and all it needs
is to be treated civilly, not pastured
to death, and let alone for a few
years after it begins to become
threadbare and it will reseed itself.
I am not one of those old-time cow
men who want to see the west fail
as a farming country and revert to
an altogether stock grazing terri
tory. I believe in this west proud
of her achievements along farming
lines but do not want to see claims
made upon a large part of the coun
try that cannot be substantiated."
The above has the right ring to
it. It is the correct ring, and to
blindly shut our eyes, to these great
natural facts for a little present ad
vantage is not only dishonest, but
will prove exceedingly harmful to
all thus misled.—Dakota Farmer.
Last. Skyscraper.
New York, Dec. 11.—A new tend
ency in skyscraper construction will
be illustrated in the new forty-three
story office building s^on to be erod
ed at No. 50 Broadway. The plans
of the architects contemplate put
ting six stories underground—the
most ambitious project of its kind
In the history of the city. Incident
ally, this new building may be the
last of the real skyscrapers, in view
of the probable action of the city
authorities limiting the height of
buildings. Next to the Singer and
Metropolitan Life building, the new
edifice will be the highest in the
city, as well as extending the deepest
•underground. In view of the latter
project, factious persons affect to be
lieve that the architects have given
up all hope of reaching heaven, and
are now trying for quite another
place.
Kansas Magazine.
Wichita, Kan., Dec. 11.—With
William Allen W'hite, Congressman
Victor Muddock, Ed. Howe of the
Atchison Globe, F. D. Coburn, Gov
ernor Hoch, and other literary
ights of the Sunflower state on its
staff, a new magazine will shortly
make its appearance from this city.
It will be known as the Kansas
Magazine and will be quite up to
the standard of the best magazines
of the effete east, if the promises of
the promoters are fulfilled."
Prcmlum Oats in South Dakota.
Omaha, Neb., Dec. 11.—The
awards for oats grown in South Da
kota, at the national corn exposition,
today were as follows: Half bushel
of oats, first, Jens Johnson, of
Brentford second, Nels Johnson, of
Mount Vernon third, Ramus Han
son, of Hurley fourth, W. L. Wat
son, of Vermillion, and fourth, F.
R. Smith, of Salem.
Senator Hansborougli Worse.
Minneapolis, Dec. 11.—Senator
Hansborough, who became ill in'
Minneapolis a few days ago while
on his way to Washington and has
been confined in his room at the
Nicolet hotel, was worse today. At
noon it was decided to take him to
Asbury hospital for treatment and
his condition tonight does not show
and change for the better.
New Record Made.
Washington, Dec. 11.—A new rec
ord in the transaction of public busi
ness was established by the house
of representatives today when the
legislative, executive and judicial
appropriation bill, which usually ex
cites considerable debate lasting sev
eral days, was passed with little de
bate and in practically the same
shape in which it came from the
committee. (An unusual feature
was that no member asked to in
dulge in general talk. The facility
with which the bill was put through
was the subject of much comment
011 the floor and the members of the
appropriations committee are much
pleased with the outcome. The bill
carries appropriations of $31,665,
329.
The house unanimously and with
out debate adopted the resolution
providing for the appointment of a
committee of five to consider the
reference to secret service in the
president's message and to suggest
what action should be takeu in the
matter.
The fight for the revision of the
rules of the house of representatives
was inaugurated tonight at a meet
ing of the so-called insurgents at
tended by twenty-five republican
representatives. Hepburn, of Iowa,
presided and was authorized to
name a committee of five, with him
self as chairman, to draft, proposed
amendmaiits to the rules and report
to the organization Tuesday. To
night the insurgents considered four
suggestions for more than two hours
and the general feeling was that if
the house must have a despotic lead
er there is no one they would rather
have than "Uncle Joe." Several
new suggestions, in addition to
those already advanced, were made
at the meeting. To increase the
membership of the rules committee
in the house has been the most, pop
ular suggestion and in this connec
tion it is proposed to have this com
mittee elected by the members of
the house instead of being named by
the speaker. The election in like
manner of committees to perform
duties similar to this body in the
senate has also been proposed by
the leaders in the movement. None
ot those present would state whether
it was intended to bring the matter
to an issue in the present session of
congress or wait for the nex session.
Those present were, Representatives
Hepburn and Hubbard, of Iowa
Campbell, Madison, Scott and Mur
dock, of Kansas Townsend and Mc
Laughlin, of Michigan Lindbergh
and Volstead, of Minnesota Cooper,
Nelson, Esch and Morse, of Wiscon
sin. Foster, of Vermont Ellis, of
Missouri McKinley and Hayes, of
California Gardner and Dovering,
of Massachusetts and Pollard, llin
shaw and Kiukaid, of Nebraska.
Printing Plant for Kgan's Paper.
•Sioux Falls, S. .D,, Dec. 11.—A
contract for the .immediate ship
ment of the mechanical equipment,
of George W. Egan's new weekly -pa
per, the American Republic, was
signed yesterday. The plant, which
will be capable of running off a
daily as well as a weekly paper, will
Oie here in about ten days
The Minnesota Type Foundry
•company of St. Paul, represented by
J. H. J. Black in this city, and Harry
Vandersluice from the house head
quarters, secured the contract,
against competition from other
houses, partly because of their abil
ity to immediately supply the equip
ment. Mr. Black says: "It is a
very good newspaper plant. There
are many dailies which have a poor
er equipment."
The plant is capable of running
off a sixteen-page, four-column
newspaper, about the same size as
the Saturday Evening Post. The
first number is expected off the
press January 1. Mr. ISgan antici
pates a circulation of between 3,0u0
and 4,000 to begin with.
Convention ol' Hoboes.
St. Louis, Dec. 11.—A call for a
national convention of the unem
ployed, 'to be held in this city 011
January 15, has been issued by
•lames ICads How, founder of the
Brotherhood Welfare Association.
It is expected that during the con
vention week St. Louis will be the
Mecca for hoboes and unemployed
men from all over the country, and
standing room will be at premium
in box cars and other conveyances
utilized by the men of the road.
How intends to secure a monster
petition, to be sent to the president,
asking that the petitioners be given
lemployment in {public works and
011 farms under the direction of the
government.
Taft Will Speak.
New York, Dee. 11.—With a defi
nite promise from William H. Taft
that he will be present at its twen
y-ithi rd annual diimer, the Ohio
Society of New York is preparing
fir the greatest affair in its history
at the Waldorf-Astoria next Wed
nesday night. Henry W. Tatt,
brother of the president-elect, is
the new president of the society,
and it is hoped to secure the attend
ance of Charles VV. Taft, of Cincin
nati, so that the dinner will be of
the nature of a Taft family reunion.
Governor Hughes and Mayor Mc
Clellan have accepted invitations to
be present and make speeches.
Many other famous men will gather
at the banquet board, and the din
ner promises to be the most notable
of it kind in the metropolis this
winter.
Dutch Warships for Venezuela.
Willemstad, Dee. 11.—The Dutch
battleship Jacob Vanheemskerk and
cruiser Gelderland left here this
morning for Venezuelan waters,
cleared for action. It is believed
they will begin the action of block
ading ports and the seizure of Vene
zuelan merchant vessels. A clash
between the Dutch warships and the
Venezuelan coast defense forces is
likely to follow.
K. of P. Fight Tuberculosis.
Chicago, Dec. 11.—It was an
nounced today that the Knights of
Pythias order has decided to es
tablish a tuberculosis sanitarium in
New Mexico for afflicted members.
Taft and Roosevelt.
Washington, Dec. 11.—President
Roosevelt and President-elect Taft
had an extended conference at the
white house today and among the
matters of discussion was the make
file of Taft's cabinet. Mr. Tatt will
have another conference tomorrow
with Secretary Root.
Judge Taft and Senator Aldrlch
conferred with regard to the work
of the monetary commission. Sena
tor Aldrich is a thorough believer
in the efficiency of the commission
and is an enthnsiastic advocate of
legislation which will place into law
some recommendations of the com
mission. Mr. Taft has heretofore
gone over those matters with Con
gressman Burton, of Ohio, a mem
ber of the commission, and it is
a safe prediction that the next ad
ministration will be favorable to the
enactment of at least some recom
mendations looking to a permanent
reform in the currency system.
Washington, Dec. 11.—With great
enthusiasm the national rivers and
harbors congress concluded its ses
sion Jiere today and placed Itself on
record as being in favor of the is
suance of government bonds for the
improvement of waterway projects.
The resolutions declared for an au
thorized issue by congress at the
present session of $50,000,000
worth of bonds, the proceeds to be
used in payment exclusively for
•inch rivor and harbor work as may
lie authorized by congress, the pro
visions to be similar to the Panama
canal bonds.
Muck Denies Reports.

A TOUGH PROPOSITION.
Incidents in Retimbering .of .Holy
Terror Shaft.
The news that the United States
Mining Company of New York, who
now have control of the Holy Terror
property at Keystone, is about to
un water the shaft and continue oper
ations, recalls some incidents that
attended the retimbering of the
workings which was conducted un
der the direction of John Simm dur
ing the time that Charles Morgan
was in charge of the property. Mr.
Simm was made a liberal offer to 're
place the old timbers In the 1,200
feet of shaft, taking on himself .the
entire contract, but he preferred to
do the work at days wages, and suc
ceeded in doing it well. It was not
accomplished, however, without ser
ious difficulties, and there are stor
ies of hair-breath escapes on tne
part of the miners w-ho were en
gaged on the job.
The original timbers of the Holy
Terror shaft were anything but sub
stantial affairs, for the richness of
the ore drew the attention of the
operators from all details of the
work but the taking out of profits,
and consequently the safety of the
workings was often overlooked,
when John Simm undertook the
work of retimbering, he found the
shaft in a dangerous condition and
it required the utmost care to pros
ecute the work and at the same time
protect the lives and limbs of his
men. The job was completed with
only a few minor Injuries reported,
but it kept Simm in a highly nervous
condition until the last set had been
put In place.
One of the miraculous escapes
took place during the early stages of
repair work, and at a time when the
really dangerous condition of the
shaft had not been fully ascertained.
One afternoon a piece of rock weigh
ing a ton and a half, broke away
from the wall of the shaft about
100 feet from the surface and forced
out .the lagging. As luck would
have the Jagging fell sidewlse and
caught one of the side timbers, form
ing a iplaform upon which the rock
lodged and was thus prevented from
falling down the shaft. At that mo
ment there were three imen work
ing at the bottom of the shaft im
mediately under the rock, and when
they later came to the surface and
found how close they had been to
death they were on the verge of ner
vous prostration.
At another time when the timber
ing was nearlng completion, it waB
necessary .to place three pieces of
lagging in the bottom set. Simm di
rected one of the men to go below
and tend to the work, but the man
seemed timid about undertaking the
job alone. At the time Simm and
several of the men were on the 100
foot level and when the man showed
a disinclination to go down alone,
he accompanied him, and they had
the job finished in a few minutes.
They returned on the cage to the
100-foot level, and picked up the
other men continuing to the surface.
The last-man had hardly stepped
from the cage when nine sets of tim
bers broke away apd plunged to
the bottom of the shaft. These are
only a few of the stories told of the
retimbering of the Holy Terror
shaft, but they are indicative Of
what chances were taken in putting
the workings in shape for opera
tion.
But the danger is now all past
the shaft is in first-class condition
almost to Its entire depth, there re
maining only about twenty-five feet
to be constructed.
Christinas for Tars.
Brooklyn, Dec. 12.—There have
been busy times at the Brooklyn na
vy yard during the last few weeks.
Hundreds of packages and parcels
marked "Christmas Gifts," and ad
dressed to tars of the Atlantic fleet,
have arrived at the yard and been
put aboard the supply ship Celtic, on
which Santa Claus will make his
voyage to greet the men of the fleet.
He will be a little late in his ar
rival but the number of good things
he will take along will more than
compensate for the delay.
Aside from the numerous pack
ages in the Santa Clause hold of
the Celtic, there will be sufficient
food for the homeward voyage of
the fleet, in addition to delicacies to
tickle Jack's palate at his belated
Christmas feast, there will be the
following quantities of staple food
stuffs
100,000 pounds of sugar.
1,000,000 pickles.
70,000 cans of tomatoes.
