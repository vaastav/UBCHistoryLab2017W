The. second daughter, -the unfortunate

leader of the destinies of Belgium, was

KING LEOPOLD II
Dead Monarch Who Long Ruled the
Belgians—Was World's Richest Ruler
•monarch was born on April 8, 1S?5, and
on Oct. 2, 1900, married Princess Eliz
abeth of iBavaria. They have three
children, Prince Leopold, 8 years old
Prince Charles, 6 years^old and Prin
cess Marie Jose, who was born Jn Aug.
4, 1906.
(Prince Albert is one of the most pop
ular members of the reigning house of
Belgium. His wife is equally popular,
their home life being such as to at
tract the admiration and love of the
people. Prince Albert has traveled ex
tensively and is a man of affairs.
p.
m. yesterday gave the king's tempera
ture, pulse, and respiration as practic
ally normal. Apparently the drainage
of the wound was perfect, as no fever
was present. The king yesterday wa%
able to take nourishment.
King Leopold's recent Illness dated
from about two weeks ago, when he
wsa compelled to take to his bed, suf
fering with rheumatism. It was
thought at the time that he had a
stroke of apoplexy, for he was par
alyzed on one side, and the paralysis
seemingly spread over the entire body.
An intestinal obstruction developed, for
.which an operation was performed on
Tuesday.
Crown Passes to Nephew.

Married to Baroness Vaughan.
Chief interest In the city last night
centered in the newspaper stories of
the marriage of the king and Baroness
Vaughan. It will be recalled that their
marriage often jvas reported and as of
ten denied, but the statement now is
ascribed to the clergyman wlio admin
istered extreme unction to Leopold.
This is regarded by most people as set
tling the question. The clergyman is
•quoted as saying:
"I assured myself beforehand that the
king's position with regard to the
church was perfectly satisfactory. I
would never administer extreme ^no
tion to anybody, not even a king, if his
life was not in accordance with the
church's -.commands."
This is taken to prove that King
Leopold and Baroness Vaughan were
regularly married. It is held, however,
that their marriage does not establish
any .claim of their two sons to the
throne, altho it may determine the dis
tribution of the king's private fortune.
Baroness Vaughan frequently visited
the palace yesterday.

Taft Pays Formal Respects.
Washington, Dec. 17.—As a mark of
respect to the dead king of Belgium,
President Taft called in person at the
Belgium legation this morning and left
his card for the minister of that coun
try.
Marriage of King Confirmed.
Paris, Dec.- 17.—A dispatch from
Rome says the Vatican confirms the
marriage of King Leopold and Baroness
•Vaughan at San Remo, Italy, last year.
Expulsion is Rumored.
Paris, Dec. 17.—A special from Brus
sels says Barones? Vaughan, reputed to
be the morganatic wife of King Leo
pold, has been expelled already from
Belgium.
HAS RULED SINCE 1865.
Belgium was the first country in
Europe to build railways, and the king
urged their prolongation to oonnect
with the merchant marine between
Antwerp and the Congo.. In .the early
years of his reign he devoted much at
tention to municipal improvements,
and Brussels, Ghent, Antwerp, Namur,
iMons, Liege, Charleroi, and Verviers
bear testimony to his activity in this
respect.
In
1886
Belgium was on the verge
of an overturning which' would have
swept the monarch frofti his throne
and the monorchy out of existence. It
was a delicate situation and called for/
the utmost diplomacy and jskill. That
Leoplold was equal to the occasion sur
prised nobody that knew his fine power
as a statesman and prince.
Adhered to H(a Promises.
1
'Not once did tho king oppose the
radicals. He appeared to float with
the tide of revolution. He yielded pro
gressively to the demands for reform,
made promises which he knew would
diisarm the more /radical element and
leave them powerless .with the people.
And more than all the rest, he kept his
contracts. He insistently fought the
conservative parliament and in thd
end forced It to surrender to the people
an equitable measure of power. From
that day forward the 'throne was
strengthened and Leopold became a fa
vorite with the people.
The king was .born in Brussels on
April 9, 1835, and on Aug 22, 1S53, he
married the Archduchess Marie of

1869, at the age of 10, and three daugh
ters. The eldest of these, Princess
Louise, was born in 1858 and married
to Prince Philip of Saxe-Coburg
Gotha. The"Second daughter, Stephanie,
who was born in 1S64, was married
to Prince Rudolph, the only son df
the Austrian emperor, since the death
of whom irt^iSSO she caused almost as
much scandal in Europe as her father.
The third daughter is the Princess
Clementine.
He Was a Gallant.
Leopold's career of gallantry dates
back 'to the days of Cora Pearl, whose
adventures amuserl Europe in the mid
dle of the last century. The women in
volved since then range from ladies of
his court to music hall performers. One
was Clara Ward, princess de Chimay,
the American woman whose elope
ment from Brussels with the gypsy
musician, Rigo, was a scandal a de
cade ago. She is said to have first lost
caste in Belgian society thru the king's
indiscreet attentions to hej\ Then there
was Mile. Cleo de Merode. the Parisian
danseuse, who wSre her hair over her
ears, and who made a brief visit to
New York in 1S97. The acquaintance
with the king boosted Cleo at once into
fame and fortune.
Creator of "Free" S*.ate.
(While the Congo state has been a
source of great wealth to Belgium it
has been somewhat of a millstone for
the small kingdom, when viewed in the
light of the recent atrocities which are
said to have been committed there.
Leopold was the creator of the Cqngo
State (originally misnamed "Free"), a
vast empire of 900.000 square miles,
from which hundreds of millions of
wealth already have flowed into Chris
tendom. It was in 187fi that Leopold
launched his prodigious enterprise. The
congress of Brussels held that year,
and made up of geographers and ex
plorers, was his opportunity^ At his

unspeakable cruelty -began to' which

In December, 1905, Mark Twain
gave utterance to a savage epigram.
"Beside Leopold," said he, "Nero,
Caligula, Attila, Torquemada, Genghis
Kahn, and such killers of men are
mere amateurs."
He went on to give an estimate of
10,000,000 hupian beings slaughtered in
the conduct of the rubber and ivory
trade of the Congo.
Shooting, Flogging and Mutilation.
There was the system of bondage
known as the collection of taxes in
kind, which exacted so much of the na
tives' labor that they starved by tho

There were shooting, flogging, multl

But to what extent was Leopold re

Probably not at all, directly. Arguing
from his rule in Belgium, It is fair to
think that he would have much pre
ferred a regime of Justice, humanity,
and progress in his big African farm.
But It can not be denied that he re

Fate seemed to have pursued King
Leopold quite as relentlessly as Em

son in so sudden and so mysterious a

economics and frequently ihas lectured people are convinced that the lad was
poisoned. Leopold's favorite nephew

upon as a son in the place of the boy
on these subjects. To broaden his
grasp of the affairs of the world he
whom he had lost, succumbed to vio
lience while engaged in a questionable
intrigue, the mansion In -which the
tragedy occurred, at Brussels, being
pointed out to all visitors to the Bel
gium capital.
Leopold's only sister, Ex-Empress
Charlotte of Mexico, had to be re
strained as a lunatic, his brother-in
law was shot down by a file of soldiers
in Mexico as an adventurer, while his:
eldest daughter, Princess Louis, after tabljshed
runfiing away from her husband and
becoming involved in charges of for
gery and fraud, was long confined as
insane in a sanatorium near* Dresden.
In 1902 an attempt was made upon
his life by an aranchist, and a few
years ago King Leopold witnessed the
destruction of the greater portion of
his family treasures by fire, his young
est daughter, Clementine, almost losing
her life in the flames, which killed her
old governess and lifelong companion.
For a long time the king indulged in
one great hobby which trust every oth
er consideration into the background.
This was the prosperity and the growth
of the Congo State. Leopold came near
ruining himself financially in order to
bring about a successful development
of this part of Africa. He saved him
self in time by quickly realizing $4,
000,000 on the sale of his stock in the
Panama canal just as that stock had
reached the highest point of its value.

Washington. Dec. 17.—The passing of
Zelaya as the dominant Influence for
evil in Central America, and especially
in Nicaragua, is regarded here as a
long step .in the direction of better
things. The government does not take
kindly to the movement to make Mad

United States will take active meas

later fairly elected. Tho murder of
Cannon and Groeo is a matter entirely
separated from the other questions in

ably will involve the arrest and pun

ATTORNEY GENERAL STEAD AR­
GUING CASE OF ILLINOIS
AGAINST CENTRAL.
INGRATITUDE NO PARALLEL
SINCE JUDAS ISCARIOT
Counsel Shows That Land Granted
Company For Right of Way Sold For
More Than Enough to Build Road—
Seven Per Cent of Gross Receipts
Sought—Dickenson on Deck.
Springfield, III., Dee. 17.—Attorney
(Jeneral Stead prefaced his argument
before the Judge, of the supreme court,
in a su^t to compel the Illinois Central
to account for 7 per cent of its gross
receipts from charter lines, here to
dny, n-Ith a statement of the case by
which the atatc of Illinois seeks to re
cover approximately IJO.UUU.OOO from
the railroad.
Tiii attorney general showed that
the state had given tho company

OPPOSITION UNITES
2,-
."itt.'i.OOO acres of land as right of way,
and he claimed this has been sold by
the Toad for $30,00,000, which wap more
sufficient to build the road.
"The claim now made by the Illinois
Central," said Stead, "that It owes
the state nothing because of this land
grant, is an example of ingratitude that
has no parallel since the time of Judas
lscari'ot."
Charter Absolute Contract.
The charter granted the railroad, he
claimed, was an absolute contract by
which the state was to receive not less
than 7 per cent of iiic h"'""
and the company to furnish the state
coplos of detailed accounts of receipts.
Since 1877 this accounting has not been
kept satisfactorily to the state. The
lines of the company have been extend
ed until now there are 4,377 miles and
upon all this mileage the state claims
a pro rata share.
Entitled to Other Profits.
Another point made by counsel for
the 3tate .was that in the matter of
bridge earnings, at Cairo and Dubuque,
tlw state is entitled to at least $7,000,
000 more than It has received.
The question of profit from dining
car service was also touched on.
Seoretary of War Dickinson was In
court, prepared to present his argu
ment for ttie Illinois Central road, ef
which he was general counsel when the
suit was begun.

New York, Dec. 17.—(Magmatea of the
National League apparently were In a
complete deadlock today -when they
met aguln to ncloct & president of the
organization, and Charles W. Murphy,
president of the Chicago club, aaaerted
his readiness to ait all winter If necea
«ary to elect Ward. New York, Chica
go. Philadelphia and Brooklyn present
ed today an unbroken front for Ward,
while Cincinnati. Pittsburg. Boston and
St. Louis are seeking to elect Brown,
of Louisville, or some compromise can
didate. The move of Garry Hermann
in bringing forward the name of Brown
yesterday Instead of Heydler was re
gnrdod today as an extremely atratefflo
one. Inasmuch as It assured Hermann
and his friends the absolute support of
Stanley Roblson. who favored Brown.
Herrmann is now In position to oltor
the name of Heydler as a compromise -1
candidate.
.Situation is Ridiculous.
Herrmann said today:
"You know as much about the elec
tion as I do. I think It a shame that
good man like Heydler, should bo
thrown out of a Job or, If he Is thrown
out. not taken care of. The present
situation Is extremely ridiculous be
cause we can not elect a board of dl
rectors until after we have elected a
president."
Herrmann said he proposed to look
after Heydler in case ho was not
elected.
As the day wore on the prospects
of a break In the deadlock over fho
presidency did not improve. The
statements of some of the magnates
made It look aa if each side was «nora
bitter than ever. Garry Herrmann,
president of the Cincinnati club, de
clared an Ironclad agreement has bjMtf
reached by Browp's supporters .n£ to
vote for Ward under any cfrcurn
stances.
Heydler May Win.
Heydler's stock took a sudden boem
this afternoon when It becamo known
that the National League bylaw* had''.
received an important amendment.
Klndlng themselves deadlocked over
the election of president, the member*
yesterday voted that In the event if
vacancy In the presidency the directors
be empowered to name a president,
act untir the league members should
have a chance to elect. Since three of
the five directors are Heydler men. It
is evident that tf the meeting proved
hopelessly locked, Heydler might bo
chosen to hold office Indefinitely.
