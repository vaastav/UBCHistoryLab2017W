THE >TAMI\HI> IMI THE lilllM.l-!.
The honor the Thurston County Po
mona Grange bestowed on Tin WASH
IN'GTON STAMIAKII last week when it
delegated its secretary to send to this
paper for publication all resolutions
adopted at its meetings, is one that
the STAMIAKII is only too glad to ac
cept, for it demonstrates to us that
we are attaining that for which we
are striving: the confidence of the
farmers of Thurston county.
We are publishing a farmers' paper.
At any time and in any way that we
can help the farmers of this county,
we propose to do it. We look to them
for suggestions, advice and counsel
and we endeavor to give them what
they never have had before: a paper
that is their paper, published in their
Interests, championing their causes.,
and ever eager to help them.
Therefore we greatly appreciate the'
favor given us by the members of the!
Thurston County Pomona Grange anil!
through them the members of all the j
subordinate Granges in the county and
all of the farmers. It is an obligation j
we are glad to assume.
( "FAKES" IX OIL.
One thing this Northwest should la-'
ment, one thing that is tending to in
jure its reputation and one that we j
should therefore all deplore, is the
growing opinion throughout the East j
and Middle West that too much faith j
cannot be placed in the reliability of I
statements concerning its many re
sources, some made in good faith,
most of them, however, to hoodwink
the unwary and thereby aid the ul
terior motives of one group or another
of speculators in some one of those re-1
sources.
This belief that many of such state
ments are bombastic, overdrawn and
misleading is quite prevalent. Men
who have come out here and invested
what little they had and then faced a i
straggle to hold it after the glittering
promises had failed to materialize,
have written back to their friends at
home and told them the story and
these friends 'have told others, until
the feeling to which we refer is alto
gether too prevalent to be beneficial to
all the interests of the state.
We had a very apt illustration of
such bombast during the last two
weeks, when apparently authentic
stories as to the finding of a high
grade of parafflne base oil at a depth
of only 350 feet on the Quiniault res
ervation, were sent broadcast. Prompt
investigation of the reported "strike"
by a city newspaper developed the fact
that the stories were "fakes" without
any foundation, that no oil had been
found, though the prospect was an ex
cellent one and every indication was
favorable.
All of us remember the old fable
about the wolf. To apply It to this sit
uation we have but to realize that con
tinued "fakes" a3 to the discovery of
oil on the reservation or anywhere
else in the state will tend to destroy
faith in the probabilities of discovery
and will retard that development for
. which we all hope when the real
"strike" com°s.
Let's tell the truth about it—now.
CONCERNING FEDERAL OFFICES.
Our very learned contemporary, the
Spokane Democrat, slipped a cog last
week in its enumeration of federal of
fices in this state which still remain
ed to be filled, making the statement
that appointees were still to be se
lected for surveyor general at Olyru
pia, superintendent of the Rainier na
tional park and commissioner of im
migration at Seattle.
The ignorance displayed by our con
temporary is remarkable. E. A. Fitz-
Henry has been surveyor general here
since early last summer: E. T. Allen
of Tacoma has been superintendent of
the national park for nearly as long
and Henry M. White's appointment as
commissioner of immigration at Se
attle was confirmed about a month aco.
Are they to be fired, Brother White?
TWO GRINC.E HKSOI.I TIONS.
Embodying in their complete form
other subjects of more local interest, a
set of resolutions was adopted at a
recent meeting of the Snohomish
County Pomona Grange of which the
following two features are of particu
lar Interest:

the school directors.
These would seem to be subjects,
then, for a more general consideration
by the fanners of the state, and per
haps for the presentation of them in
some form or other to the legislature.
A general discussion of such subjects
might result in the adoption of re
forms that would be of considerable
benefit.
m iI. DIM: A AHH VFAIV
Last June the newly organized state
department of agriculture took over
the management of what had been
known as a state fair at Yakima. This
fall it presented to the people of the
state the first real state fair Washing- i
ton had ever known, the only state fair |
in which nearly every county had been
represented. In the meantime it had
erected some greatly needed buildings
—in other words it had turned the
Yakima exposition from a county show
into a state fair, and everybody was
glad.
Now it develops—and the Republi
can newspapers are "making a moun
tain" out of it—that there remains but
SB,OOO out of an appropriation of $40,-
000 for the biennium, and we see big
headlines and bigger stories about
Democratic extravagance giving the
impression that only SB,OOO is availa
ble for the 1914 fair. All of which
would be well and good if It were true,
in spite of the fact that this was the
first and best state fair Washington
ever had, but let's get down to the
truth.
Half of the appropriation for the bi
ennium available this year was $20,000.
When the Democratic administration |
took over the fair's management on |
June 12 last it found two things:
That a deficit of SB,OOO had been left
by the last (Republican) administra
tlon.
That many unnecessary, highly ex
pensive and what later turned out to
be unsatisfactory amusement attrac
tions had already been contracted for.
The first item reduced to $12,000 the
amount available this year for the fair;
the second item added several thou
sand dollars of needless expense. In
both instances the hands of the Demo
crats were tied. The bills had to be
paid.
What happened? In spite of these
difficulties, the department, through
its energetic and capable commission
er, J. H. Perkins, got exhibits for the
fair from nearly every county in the
state and so handled the exposition
that the largest crowds in its history
attended and gate receipts of some
thing more than $20,000 were taken in.
Paying for these unsatisfactory at
tractions previously contracted for and
i the cost of the permanent improve
■ ments made on the grounds took $24,-
I 000 of the $40,000; in other words, the
! department over-ran the half of the ap
j propriation $4,000. The paying of the
| SB,OOO deficit left by the Republicans
| brought this total up to $32,000, so that
but SB,OOO was left In the appropria
tion. Are the Democrats to be blamed
for the mistakes and the extravagance
of their predecessors?
Next year the fair will have amuse
ments, but it will have satisfactory
ones and the contract prices will be
more carefully scrutinized. Several
i thousand dollars can be saved that
! way. Next year, too, as large an at
j tendance at least as this year will be
! counted, very likely more because the
; reputation of the 1913 fair Insures an
jexposition of greater state-wide inter
est. So there will be at least $20,000
!in receipts. Therefore at least s'\s JOO
and very likely $30,000 or $32,001 will
| be available for the 1914 fair instead of
• the SB,OOO we have been hearing so
i much about.
There is the truth.

Alaska because its development means
our development just as we are in

policy because it will unlock untold
wealth of our own; we are interested
| in the establishment of a satisfactory
system of rural credits, not only be
cause we have millions of acres of un
cultivated land in this state we want
to see producing wealth, but also he-
cause we want to see the farmers now
here relieved, so far as better credit !
facilities will relieve them, of the bur
dens they must now carry. And so the
benefits that would be derived front
the successful carrying out of these !
two recommendations are united in '
this Pacific Northwest.

TONO.
Thanksgiving was observed by ev
eryone in Tono last Thursday. All
business was suspended on that day
and the miners had a day of Thanks
giving and rest. Many families en
tained out of town guests while others
feasted with relatives in Tono and ad
' joining towns. The Ladles' H. B. club
( of Tono gave a Thanksgiving ball
on Thanksgiving eve. A very large
crowd attended and a splendid time
was reported by all. When the mem
bers of H. B. club give a dance they
leave nothing undone toward prepar
-1 ing for the affair and entertaining the
patrons. The hall was beautifully dec
orated for the occasion and an elabo
rate old fashioned turkey supper like
mother used to prepare down on the
farm was served at midnight. For
sythe's four-piece orchestra was keyed
up to a pitch that pave vivacity to the
affair, even the old timers tallowed up
their boats and cavorted around in the
quadrilles, rye waltzes and Virginia
reel which were put on for their spe
cial benefit. The H. B. club will prob
ably give another dance in the near fu
ture and we will all be there.
' The Tono Athletic club's soccer foot
ball team journeyed to Tacomn
Thanksgiving day and played the Ta
coraa Northwest Soccer league team to
a 2 to 2 tie. The Northwest fans were
considerably surprised to see their
' crack professional team played to a
standstill and it caused no little ex
citement to have a team from the
"brush" show them up.
! The soccer football team expects to
play the fast Carbonado team New
Year's day in Tenino. This game will
]show the merits of the Southwest and
Northwest territory and will be a con
test well worth going a long way to
witness. All those interested in first
class soccer football should not miss
the opportunity to see this game as the
Tono team is fast and classy while the
Carbonado team needs no advertising
regarding their ability on the field.
| Thanksgiving evening, Mr. and Mrs.
R. R. Ober entertained, at cards, a few
'friends. Rridge, five hundred and oth
jcr popular games were played. Mr. T.
H. Gaines and Mrs. A. X. Turnbull
were awarded prizes. A dainty lunch
eon was served and all enjoyed a very
pleasant evening.
The many friends of S I. Rodda,
J who has been employed as city electri
cian in Tono the past year, will be
I sorry to hear of his leaving for Hanna,
Wyo., December 2. Mr. Rodda was an
! active member in Tono society, also
(at. the Tono Athlptic club and his
many fripp.ls of this vicinity hope he
will meet with success and prosperity.
The young men of Tono are organiz
