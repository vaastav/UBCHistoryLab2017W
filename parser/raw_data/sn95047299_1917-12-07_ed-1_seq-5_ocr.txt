Message
Our present and immediate task is
to win the war, and nothing shall
turn us aside until it is accomplished.
Those who desire to bring about
peace before that purpose is achieved,
I counsel to carry their advice else
where. As a nation we are united in spirit
and intention. I par little heed to
those who tell me otherwise.
This intolerable thing
this menace of combined intrigue and
tber industrially or politically. We
only desire to see that their affairs
are left in their own hands.
The people of Germany are being
told by men whom they now permit
to deceive them and act as their mas-)
ters that they are fighting for the j
very life and existence of their em-1
plre. Nothing could be more gross-1
ly or wantonly false. '
The worst that can happen to the j
German people is that, after the war j
is over, if they continue to live u.1;
der ambitious and intriguing mas-:
ters men whom other peoples of tht
world could not trust, it might be im-:
possible to admit them to the part- j
nership of nations. That partnership
must be a partnership of peoples. It
might be impossible, also to admit '
Germany to free economic intercourse ,
of real peace.
The very deep wrongs committed ',
in this war will have to be righted.
But they cannot be righted by the
commission of similar wrongs against
Germar.v and hei allies.
The Russian people have been
poisoned by the very same falsehoods
that have kept the German people in
the dark, and the poison has been ad
ministered by the very same hands.
The only possible antidote is truth.
I' cannot be administered too plainly ;
or too often.
We are seeking permanent, net tem-;
porary foundations for the peace of
the world, and must seek them can-'
didly and fearlessly. As always, the I
right will prove to be the expedient. I
! Austria-Huneary is for the present i
not her own mistress, but simply the
v asset of the German government.
