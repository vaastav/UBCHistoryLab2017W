CONGRESS PUSHES
BUSINESS BILLS
House to Revise Revenue Stat
utes, but May Delay
Tariff Changes.
RETURN OF RAILROADS.
3est Points in Cummins Measure Will
Supplant Clauses -in Esch Bill
and Conference Committee
Will Draft Real Law.
Washington.—lmportant legislation
effecting business and industry awaits
the consideration of Congress during
the present regular session.
Immediate steps will be taken to
push the railroad bill. This ineasnre
luts been made the indinished order of
business in the senate, and will he
taken up at once. The plan is to i
substitute tlie essential features of the
Cummins bill for the Esch bill as
passed by the house and to rush it
through the senate and allow confer
ence committees to frame the real
measure.
It is the belief that the anti-strike
provision of the Cummins bill will
meet with the approval of the senate
but the house appears to be flatly
against it and tlie final compromise
relative to wage adjustment will have
to be something much more moderate.
Senator Cummins, who, as chairman
of the senate committee on Interstate
Commerce, will be in charge of rail
road legislation in the senate, will
make every effort to expedite action.
There is still a chance of action before
the end of the calendar year, when the
roads are to be returned to their own
ers.
Failure to enact legislation before
the holidays will cause an eleventh
hour effort to be made to pass an
emergency bill, which would continue
governmental guarantees temporarily
pending the passage of a permanent
measure.
Another important piece of legisla
tion which is up for immediate action
is the Edge bill for the formation of
foreign financing corporations under
the supervision of the Federal Re
serve Hoard. The bill has been passed
by both houses and conference com
mittees headed by Senator McLean of
Connecticut and Representative Hiatt
* of New York agreed upon a com
promise bill. The conference report
was submitted to tlie house just be
. fore tlie adjournment of the extra
session. It will he called up for action
early in tlie week and then sent over
to the senate.
The probability is that tlie house will
approve the conference report without
much difficulty but there may be a
hitch in tlie senate. The action of the
conference in striking nut the senate
provision for the elimination of the
double liability is expected to provoke
a fight In tlie seimte. Rejection of the
conference report by the senate would
mean that the conferees would have
to renew their negotiations.
Another subject of legislation which
will receive early attention is that re
lating to dyes. The Longworth bill in
creasing tariff duties and providing for
control of imports of dyes by a license
system was passed by the house sev
eral months ago but never lias been
considered by the Senate Finance
Committee before which it is pending.
The Finance Committee deferred ac
tion pending (he disposal of tlie peace
treaty, but was instrumental in put
ting through the resolution for a con
tinuation of tlie authority of the War
Trade Board Section of the state de
partment over dyes until .January 15.
Senator Penrose, of Pennsylvania,
chairman of the committee, is expected
to arrange for hearings on dye legisla
tion in the near future. Whether tpe
committee will approve tlie Long
worth bill in its present form is ex
tremely doubtful. Senator Smoot, of
Utah, and other influential Republic
an senators, have declared themselves
opposed to the license sytem and
numerous witnesses representing dye
consumers are expected to appear in
opposition to it.
Representative Fordney, of Mich
igan, chairman of the house Ways and
Means Committee, has been anxious to
lake up general tariff revision during
i lie winter session, but may be side
tracked by other Republicans.
POSTAL PROFITS TOTAL $44,838,790
Gross Revenues for Service $436,239,-

Washington.—Net earnings of $44,-
838,790 were made by the postal serv
ice for the fiscal year ending June 30
last. Postmaster General Burleson re
ported to Congress. The gross rev
enues of tlie service were $430,239,126
and the expenditures were $391,400,-

RUN NATION IN 1321
Largest Sum Ever Sought by
Federal Departments for a
Peace Year.
Washington.—-The record $1,000,-
000,000 Congresses of ordinary peace
times faded into tlie past when Secre
tary Glass, presenting the annual es
timates, proposed appropriations of
virtually $5,000,00,000 for conducting
tlie peace-time activities of the govern
ment during the fiscal year 1921. Ac
cording to these figures it will cost
more than five, times as much to con
duct the peace-time affairs of govern
ment as it did in tlie year immediately
preceding the world war.
The greatest individual estimates
for expenditures, of course, go to tlie
army and the navy. Tlie yearly inter
est on the war debt, however, is sl,-
017,500.000, which sum alone is great
er than all the appropriations for all
purposes whatsoever of any peace
time Congress.
All in all, the estimates justify the
predictions made on the floor of Con
gress during consideration of the war
tax bills Hut the present generation
would not see the government conduct
ed at an expense of less than $4,000,-
000,000 a year.
The estimated appropriations for the
principal government departments
were presented as follows;
Legislative (Congress)... $9,025,297.25
Executive (White House
and government de
partment) 149,111,403:77
Judicial 1,034,190:00 a

Public works 273,921,810.17
? ’.iscellaneoi.s 833,717,(>37.90
Foreign intercom-! } 11,243,250.91
The total of all estimates, including
some comparatively minor items not?
included in the foregoing, is $4,865,-*.
410,031.62, the greatest sum everv
asked of any Congress when the coun-f
try was not actually at war. c
Tlie billion dollar estimate for the'
army includes $85,000,000 for the Na
tional Guard. The $542,000,000 esti
mate for the navy includes provision
for the program of increase. The
$273,000,000 public works estimate in
cludes tlie Panama canal, reclamation :
projects, rivers and harbor improve
ment, public buildings and also mill-'
tary works, arsenals and fortifications.
The estimates for miscellaneous ex-:
pendltures contain some tremendous
sums. For the treasury department ’
more than $247,000,000 is asked, which
goes largely to the enforcement of
prohibition and collection of income,
corporation and excess profit taxes.

PALMER WARNS THE MINERS, j
Production cf Coal Falls to 38 Per
Cent, of Norma!—Fuel Denied to All
Plants-Except Transportation. In
stitutions, and Retail Business.
Washington.—Tlie coal situation in
.the United -States- Is 'becoming alarm
ing. Production fallen off so much
that after the breaking of negotiations
to end the strike it was estimated at
between 30 and 38 per cent, of normal.
As a result cf tiii- situation rigid
conservation measures were urged by
Dr. Henry A. Garfield, tlie Fuel A 1-
ministrator, t lio in a public statement
requested the reinstatement of light
less nights and other economies prac
ticed in war times.
Placing in effect of these measures
Is left largely to the public spirit of
officials and citizens, but they will be
enforced if voluntary co-operative ac
tion is not obtained.
Tlie Great White Way in New York
must be dimmed again, advertising
signs cut out and useless lights
banned. '
Coal strike conservation of coal is
to go even further than' that of war
times. Coal will he distributed by the
Railroad Administration only to the
first five listings on the priority list
of tlie Fuel Administration. They are:
A —The railroad and transporta
tion services, including coastwise
steamships.
B —The Army and Navy and
other departments of the Federal
Government.
C—State, county and municipal
governments and institutions, in
cluding hospitals, institutions,. &c.
D —Public utilities . (Ibis in
cludes newsprint paper mills mak
ing paper for dailies and all news
papers. Office buildings, also un
der tin's designation, will get all
tlie coal necessary for reasonable
use).
E —Retail dealers (domestic
consumers are supplied under tlijs
heading).
Industries that are not essential to
the maintenance of Fife and hura-i:
comfort tn the emergency will not lie
supplied with any coal. Those-re
ceiving coal are warned that only
enough \vjjl be? supplied for essential
uses. Public utilities are; aSke.d # to
limit coal consumption ard to furnish
neither heat, light nor pov. er for non
essential uses. There are no pre
ferred factories, except those certified
on Government work and those fur
nishing necessary creature comforts.
‘ Despite this acute situation and
rigid limiting of fuel, supplies tlie Gov
ernment is determined to fight it out
with the coni miners and with the
operators if necessary. No further
concessions will be made to either side
and no new efforts to settle the strike
will he made. This was made plain
by Attorney-General Palmer in a tele
gram lo the Chamber of Commerce of
Moherly, Mo., in which he said lie did
not aprove of a suggestion for ai -
other conference and that any further
concessions would be an imposition
upon the American public. He urged
the public to stand firm with the
Government.
The coal strike lias spread to outly
ing districts as a result of the failure
of negotiations jn Washington and the
government’s stand against a wage
increase greater than 14 per cent. In
many sections outside of the central
competitive fields, where miners had
remained at work or had returned ex
pecting to get the benefit of the big
wffge advance looked for as a resu't
of tlie strike, numbers spurned the 14
per cent, proposition. They expected
to get the benefit of a big retroactive
advance forced by their fellpws.
It was this defection from the mines
. that brought production down -nearly
;50 per cent, to under 38 per c£nt. and .
determined the prompt calling into
effect of rigid economy measures.

GOAL MINES RUNNING
Promises Full Protection and Will
Prosecute Any Attempt to
Hinder Work in Fields.
Washington.—All the powers of the
federal government are to be brought
into play immediately to break tlie
coal strike, which lias been held by the
federal court iu Indianapolis to be ille
gal.
Leaders of the United Mine Workers
of America who persist in violation of
the Lever act by agreeing or arranging
to hinder production of coal are to be
prosecuted. This step has been deter
mined upon by tlie cabinet.
The strong arm of the military pow
er of the nation is ready to be thrown
about tlie coal fields, and federal au
thority will brook no fiinber interfer
ence. Men who individually want to
quit (lie coal mines and stay out will
not be interfered with, but all of those
who agree or arrange to stay-out or
to hinder production, whether miners
or operators, are to be dealt with.
Attorney General Palmer sent a mes
sage to all district attorneys acquaint
ing them with the situation and in
structing them to act. It is an open
secret that district and local leaders
have held meetings and urged tlie
men to stay out. This is regarded as
defiance of tlie law. No action was
taken while negotiations to settle the
difficulty were under way.
With the negotiations off and an
acute condition of national peril con

will be pursued. Judge G. B. Ames,

PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS:
I *
Urges Placing Budget Under Uni- •
tied System and Questions
Utility of Further Income
and Profits Taxation.
WILSON WARNS OF UNREST. ;
The President’s Recommendations.
A budget system with one single au- •
thority responsible for all appropria- ■
tions and expenditures and without •
the approval of which Congress cannot •
make appropriations.
Legislation to protect new indus- ■
tries, especially the dyestuff industry.
Legislation to remove the cause of •
political restlessness in the body poll- •
tic and curb radicalism. ’
Advancement of the program to pro- •
vide farm lands for soldiers.
Further legislation to bring down ■
the cost of living.
Fair’play for labor and the estab- j ■
lishment of the principles regarding ■
labor laid down in the covenant in the i ■
League of Nations, in the realization
“that the seed of revolution is repres
sion."
In his remarks on labor President
Wilson said:
“The establishment of the principles
regarding labor laid down in the cove
nant of the League of Nations offers
us the way to industrial peace and con- |
ciliation. No other road lies open to
us. * * * Governments must rec
ognize the right of men to bargain col
lectively for humane objects. * * *
Labor must no longer be treated as a
commodity.”
“The only way to keep men from
agitating against grievances is to re
move the grievances.”
Washington.—Genera 1 recomraen da
tions on legislation to combat the high
cost of living, labor unrest, radicalism
and a readjustment of the nation to
peace-time basis were the features of
President Wilson’s annual message.
The peace treaty, the President told
Congress, will be discussed in a
separate message later, as will the
railroad question.
For the second time only, since the
President established the practice- of
addressing Congress in person, his
message was read by the clerks.
The President’s principal recom
mendations were:
Establishment of a budget system
for the national finances.
Reorganization of the taxation sys
tem with simplification of the income
and excess profits.
Readjustment of the tariff system,
if necessary, to meet changed world
conditions and make the system con
form with the fact that the United
States is “the greatest capitalist In
the world.”
Relief for Soldiers.
Recognition and relief for veteran
soldiers of the world war, particularly
In the way of government farms as
proposed by Secretary Lane.
Proper measures to foster the dye
stuffs industry built up during the
war to keep the United States inde
pendent of foreign supply.
An enlarged program for rural de
velopment, in recognition of the
farmers’ part in the war.
Measures which “will remove the
causes” of “political restlessness in
our body politic.”
At this point the President made his
most extensive reference ,to the peace
treaty by saying that the causes for
the unrest “are superficial rather than
deep seated” and that they “arise from
or are connected with the failure on
the part of our government to ar
rive speedily at a “just and perma
nent peace permitting return to nor
mal conditions, from the transfusion
of radical theories from seething Eu
ropean centers pending such delay,
from heartless profiteering resulting
from the increase of the cost of living,
and lastly from the machinations of
passionate and malevolent agitators.
With the return to normal conditions
this unrest will rapidly disappear.”
On the Cost of Living.
The President renewed his recom
mendations for legislation to deal ef
fectively with “those persons who by
violent methods would abrogate our
time tested institutions.”
Several recommendations, some re
newals of previous ones, were made by
the President to bring down , the cost
of living. Among them were exten
sion of the food control law to peace
times for the emergency; regulations
for transportation of foods in inter
state CQimne.co; a cold storage law
modeled after the law in New Jersey;
a law requiring marks to show the
length of time foods are kept in stor
age, and a law to secure “competitive
selling and prevent unconscionable
profits” by federal license of corpora- j
tions selling food in interstate com
merce. 4
A long portion of the message was
devoted to a discussion of the condi
tion and rights of labor. “A definite
program to bring about an improve
ment in the conditions of labor and
bring about a genuine democratization
of industry” was recommended.
“Remove Grievances.”
“The only way to keep men from
agitating against grievances is to re
move the grievances,” said the Presi
dent's message. At another point it
declared “the seed of revolution is re
pression.!’
“The establishment of the princi
, pies regarding labor, laid down in the
covenant of the League of Nations,”
said the message, “offers us the way
Russia a Painful Example.
The President’s message closed with
a pointed reference to radicalism and
Red doctrines, and referred to “Rus
sie today with its blood and terror” as
a “painful object lesson of the power
of minorities.” “There are those in
this country,” said the message, “who
threaten direct action to force their
will upon a majority. . . It makes
little difference what minority it is,
whether capital or labor or any other,
class, no sort of privilege will ever
be permuted to dominate this
trjr,”

“The right of individuals to strike
is inviolate,” continued the message,
“and ought not to be interfered with
by any process of government, but
there is a predominant right, and that
is the right of government to protect
all of its people and to assert its
power and majesty against the chal
lenge of any class.”
The President was referring to the
government’s recent injunction against
the coal strike.
Warns of Radicalism.
The message closed with a pointed
reference to radicalism and Red doc
trines and referred to “Russia today
with its blood and terror” as a “pain
ful object lesson on the power of
minorities.”
“There are those in this country,”
said the message, “who threaten di;
rect action to force their will upon a
majority. * * * It makes little dif
ference what minority it is, whether
capital or labor or any other class;
no sort of privilege will ever be per
mitted to dominate this country.” '
Orderly processes, the message de
clared, were the only ones by which,
relief and reform could be obtained.
“Those who would propose any oth
er method of reform are enemies of
this country,” the message said.
“• * • Let those beware who take
the shorter road of disorder and revo
lution.”
Labor not only Is entitled to an ade r
quate wage, the message states, but
capital should receive a reasonable re
turn upon its investment and is en
titled to protection at the hands of the
government in every emergency.
When Strike Must Give Way.
The right of individuals to strike is
Inviolate and ought not to be inter
fered with by any process of govern
ment, declares the President, but there
is a predominate right and that is
the right of the government to protect
all of its people and to assert its -pow
er and majesty against the challenge
of any class. The government, when
it asserts that right, seeks not to an
tagonize a class, but simply to defend
the right of the whole people ,aa
against the irreparable harm and in
jury that might be done by the at
tempt by any class to usurp a power
that only government itself has- a right
to exercise as a protection to all. y
In conclusion the message says:
“This is the hour of test and trial;
for America. By her prowess and
strength and the indomitable courage
of her soldiers she demonstrated her
power to vindicate on foreign battle
fields her conception of liberty and’
justice. Let not her influence as a
mediator between capital and .labor be
weakened and her own failure to set
tle matters of purely domestic con
cern be proclaimed to the world.
Fears Not Direct Action.
“There are those in this country
who threaten direct action to force
their wiil’ - upon a majority. Russia
today, with its blood and terror, is a
paintut.object lesson of the. power of
minorities. It makes little difference
what minority it is, whether capital’
or labor or any other class. No sort
of privilege will ever be permitted to
dominate this country. WO are a
partnership or nothing that is worth
while. We are a democracy where
the majority are the masters, or all
the hopes and purposes of the men
who founded this government have
been defeated and forgotten.
“In America there is but one wgy
! by which great reforms can be?ac
complished and the relief sought by
classes obtained, and that is through
the orderly processes of representative
government. Those who would pro
pose any other method of reform are
enemies of this country.
“America will not be daunted by
threats nor lose her composure or
calmness in these distressing times.
We can afford, in the midst of this

reorganization. His plans had included
the formation of the two infantry regi
ments, the brigade headquarters, the
field hospital company and other units.

provide an opportunity fior those who
prefer that branch.

General Warfield includes all units
previously authorized as well t* all
•listing -unite of the National Guard
In this State which have been recog
nized by the War Department and rep
resents the total number of guard
units allotted to the State for which
Federal funds are available for the
current-fiscal year.
Adjutant-General Warfield bas al
ready named the commanders of the
two infantry regiments. Col. Milton
A. Reckord will command the First
Regiment and Col. Washington Bowie,
Jr., will command the Fifth Regiment.
The two . colonels are expected to an
nounce their plans for the recruiting
and enrollment of the two units within
a few days. Both have received let
ters from ’many former officers and
enlisted men who are anxious to be
come guardsmen.

Reserve Bank of Richmond, “purchases
by retail merchants have been well sus
tained and the indications are for a
steady demand for merchandise
throughout the balance of the year.
Great difficulty la being exiperienced in
securing a full quota of supplies from
producers. Deliveries are very slow
and in many lines allotments for fu
ture deliveries are being made and ad
vances in prices are expected rather
than recessions. Great difficulty in
obtaining raw materials is reported.
“The tobacco crop throughout the
district is estimated at 60 per cent
of normal, but -the highest prices ever
obtained are being realized. It Is
being sold, rapidly, and the proceeds
are already- providing some liquidation
and assisting in the limited market
ing of cotton.” - ’
