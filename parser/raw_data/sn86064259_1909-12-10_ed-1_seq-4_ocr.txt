FRIDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1909.
STREE'I CAR MANNERS.
There are scores of Negro men in
this city who need to be taken aside
and given a few lessens in how to
conduct themselves on street cars.
They are faulty in many ways, hut
we believe they are guilty of greater
sins of omission than commission. One
sin of omission that so many of them
are so often guilty of is the way they
block the entrance to street cars.
The law provides that colored people
seat from the rear and white people
from the front. Of course the whit
people do not observe that portion of
the Jaw; but instead they begin to
take the first seats they come to.
The brother in black steps up in the
door, sees a hite man sitting in his
seat and all the seats in the front of
the car empty he continues to stand.
A half dozen others will come in and
do the same thing;, hence,- the en
trance way is blocked while the front
fnd of the car is empty.
The colored men need to be taught
how to act on street cars. They need to
be taught the meaning of the law and
how to keep within its bounds on tlie
Ftreet cars. They should be made to
see the folly in huddling., up like
spared sheep in the back, and to know
that as long as there is a vacant seat
in the car, they are entitled to it, un
der the law.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Taft's message to the sixty-first
Congress is an able document.
It shows him to be a careful student
of the affairs of (his nation. The
people have been longing for this mea
sage in order that Taft, the man that
he is, might be seen.
The ten millions of Negroes in the
Ijnited States will be highly elated
to learn that he endorses the. proposi
tion to hold a celebration in 1013 In
commemoration of the fiftieth anni
versary of the Emancipation Proclama
tion. ..They will also take favorably his
recommendation that congress pay the
balance due the Freedman's Savings &
Trust Company depositors. These are
plain business propositions and if the
recommendation and endorsement are
carried out', all the Negroes of the
country will be benefitted in one way
or another. There will, of course be
those who will find fault with the
message, that is always true; but
u e fail to see how any severe crltlci3nj
can bo made. He, no doubt, failed to
say some things that some people
think he should have said, but those
ijdividuals did not write the message
and the president did not know they
desired that he should say what was
in their minds. The document shows
sanity and diplomacy such as serve to
maintain the confidence of the peopK1.
STATE NORMAL.
The Negroes ot the State of Ten
nessee, from the progressive city of
Memphis in the west to our secluded
Mountain City in the east, are right
now absorbed in the location of the
Normal, Agricultural and Mechanical
College for the Negro youth that
was provided for by the last
Legislature. Several towns and most
of the largo cities are bidding for
the school, but thus far the committee
that has the matter in charge have
not hinted as to what section of the
state will be decided upon. The Globe
holds the same position it has ex
pressed from time to time, and that
is that the institution should be lo
cated in a section of the state when
it can be of the most benefit to the
most people.
It is hoped that every one will
work for the people's interest We
want our State Normal School to be
an ideal one in every sense of the
word. We believe it can be made so,
and it will be if the Negroes from
every section of our commonwealth
will for once make a united pull.
The Tennessee Colored State Fair
Association seems to have caught the
same disease that has always lurked
in the path of our Business Leagues:
an annual meeting and an annual ad
journment. Mr. J. C
townsman,
Napier, our distinguished
is being favorably men
tioned for an appointment by the Taft
administration. No more loyal nor
competent man can be found in the
Republican ranks.
Mr. Arthur J. Johnson, champion
head receiver of the world, has at last
got his man cornered. If he does any
linking he ought to be killed, dried
and ground into powder.
Old Crimp is with us this week.
He always comes about the time water
taxes are due and freezes (?) up th"
hydrants of the delinquents.
EDITORIAL CLIPPINGS.
The public press announces that
President Taft has at his disposal a
number of 'important offices which
are now filled by colored men. We
hope when these colored mens' terms
expire their jobs will not be passed
on to white men as has been the
President's policy in other . cases.

An Ovation.
Dr. Booker T. Washington is re
ceiving an ovation' wherever he
speaks in the State of Tennessee.. It
is quite evident that ail classes of
citizens irrespective of color, condi
tion, .politics or religious creeds' are
giving Dr. Washington such an ova
tion as kings and queens only can
receive.
There is something in the . man.
He possesses a faculty that no other
colored American in this country pos
sesses. His advice to his people i3
such that will be a benefit to them.

David Albert Green.
In the passing away of David A.
Green The Age has lost a valued
worker whose energy and activity in
its service were only matched by his
sterling integrity and reliability. As
an advertising agent he was earnest,
persuasive and unremitting in his ef
forts to secure business, and equally
energetic in his efforts to retain it by
promoting results for the advertiser.
His judgment was rarely at fault in
sizing up a customer, and his role as
a mediator between advertiser and
publisher usually brought satisfaction
to both sides. Mr. Green was a New
Yorker by birth and training, and
was always' an ardent and enthusias
tic champion of the Etmpire City, its
people and institutions. He pos
sessed a fund of historical informa
tion bearing on this subject, fortl
fled by rare papers and pamphlets.
In his private life he was a devoted
husband and father, and enjoyed the
satisfaction of seeing his two daugh
ters prepare to enter upon a career
of future usefulness. In him we
have lost a friend and worker. New
York Age. ' ,
It does seem to us that as little de
lay as possible should be shown by
the powers-that-be in the Republi
can party in bringing to justice
those guilty of stealing the franchise
of thousands) of people at the last
election. The Democratic party is
constantly laughing in its sleeve at
the pigmy efforts of the Republican
politicians. Like a lot of little school
children they are always crying that
they do not get justice at the polls,
but never take the steps to secure
what by right belongs to them. The
Democratic party will actually steal
the whole State right from under the
noses of the Republicans and then
laugh at them. We need good strong
leadership in this State. When, oh
when, will we ever . get it? Afro

The public drinking cup on trains
is dangerous because of its location,
the questionable character of the ice
water that is purveyed and the use
of the cup by all sorts of people. The
most baleful and the most loathsome

Our enrollment to date is 325. The
day school numbers 255 and the night
school 70. Judging from the applica
tions we are apt to have 35j0 students

boarding students are nearly equally
divided the girls being slightly in
the majority. Normal Index.
WOMANS' CHRISTIAN AID.
The Womans Christian Home Aid
Association met at the home of the
Secretary, Mrs. Georgia Green, Vir
nal street, with the number of 20
members answering to their names
and two men members were added
to our number.
MARTHA COURT ENTERTAIN
MENT. Martha Court No .80, of Calanthe,
of which Miss Janie Benson Is Wor
thy Counsellor, gave a most unique en
tertainment at the home of Dr. and
Mrs. J. B. " Singleton last Friday
night. As the affair was given to
swell the finances, there were eata
bles of all kinds for sale. In addition
to these there was a hunting contest
in which those who cared to hunt
were found scurrying to and fro
through the house finding little
packages, all of which contained
something worth looking for, besides
little numbered cardboards, the
lucky number drawing a prize. Miss
Mattie B. Scales was winner in this
receiving as a prize a beautiful fern
jardiniere. There was also a bean
contest in which the number of beans
contained in a quart jar were to be
guessed. 'Miss Nellie E. King re
ceived for the nearest guess to the
number a box of candy. The most
amusing feature of, the entertain
ment was the "Old Curiosity Shop,"
into which one at a time all who
cared were allowed to spend one
minute, and afterward write from
memory the number or articles seen,
the one writing the largest num
ber of articles receiving a Japanese
chocolate pot. This prize was cap
tured by Miss Nellie E. King. Be
sides, there w&s a fortune-teller, who
told the future, past and present of
all.
The affair, which is said to have
been a financial success,' was greeted
by a most jolly crowd of people. Miss
Benson was ably assisted by Mes-
dames S. P. Harris, Wm. Boger, J. B.
Singleton, N. I. Riz, F. J. Work, R.
II. Boyd, Misses A. R. Dunlap and
Elizabeth Moore.
Better Get Busy.
Standing in front of one of the the
atres not long ago, we noticed the
large number of automobiles and the
very few Afro-American chaffeurs.
This set us to thinking and we com
menced to wonder whether or not the
Negro coachman was preparing for
the change which seems to be on Its
way? There was a time when nearly,
if not all the barber shops In this
city were owned and controlled by
Negro barbers. Now, as a matter of
fact there are very few Negro bar
ber shops where white people shave,
and the most of these are out of the
center of population.
Are the Negro coachmen going to
lose out the barbers have lost
out? We hope not. But now is the
time to make preparation for the fu
ture. Many of these people who are
still clinging to a pair of high step
ping bays, will soon fall Into the craze
of owning and operating a "buz
wagon," and if Mr. Black Coachman
is not prepared to step from the box
to a front seat in an auto, there will
be another man In his place and ho
will be looking for a job.
We are informed that there are
night schools where the art of man
aging these machines is taught and
we advise our friends, the Black
Coachmen, to "get busy" before It is
time and eternally too late for a
front seat in the "Devil wagon."

The President's Recommendations.
The recommendations of the Pres
ident in his message to Congress, ask
ing that favorable . consideration be
taken concerning the Freedman's
Saving and Trust Company and the
proposed 1913 National Exposition
for the Negro people of the United
States, accord with their wishes and
approval.
The Freedman's Savings and Trust
Company, that ill-starred financial
concern that wrought such havoc with
the financial savings of the soldiers
who had confided them to the keeping
of that institution, was inaugurated
under the authority of the Govern
ment, and, in view of that fact, the
Government should have long since
made just restitution. That institu
tion was the agent of the Government
which had granted to it the power
and authority of operation, and that,
according to the accepted theory,
spirit and precedent of law which
places the responsibility of the acts
of the agent upon the principal,
should hold good in this case where
the Government is responsible for
the peculations of the Freedman's
Savings and Trust Company, its agent
by grant of legal power of operation.
Many of the men who had fought the
battles of their country lost practi
cally all of their savings from what the
Government had paid them for their
services in the collapse and suspen
sion of that institution. Although
many have passed beyond the need
of any action of Congress in the mat
ter, yet there remains, a thin blue
line of those who once staked their
lives in the hell of battle for the sal
vation and preservation of the life of
a free and united government who
would justly come into their own by
favorable consideration and action on
this long deferred matter.
The President's favorable recom
mendation of the movement which
hag been inaugurated to hold a Na
tional Exposition in 1913, for the pur
pose of showing what the Negro peo
ple have achieved In fifty years of
freedom, is commendable and timely.
While the period of time which shall
have elapsed between 1863 to 1913
will only be nominally 50 years In
which the Negro people have made
such wonderful progress in what con
stitutes American civilization, yet
that number of years is the actual
life of the issuance of the Emancipa
tion Proclamation. This movement
should find favor with all the people,
and they should put forth every effort
to make this exposition, which shall
mark their fifty years' march from
slavery, a glorious affair commensur
ate with their achievements.

THE NASHVILLE GLOBE,
447 Fourth avenue, North, Nash
ville, Tenn.
NASHVILLE GLOBE HIGHLY COM
MENDED. Time and again the Nashville Globe
has received letters, cards, telephone
messages and personal compliments
on some special article, issue or news
item, but they come so constantly
that it is not every time we can ac
knowledge them and yet, the Globe
feels that for every sincere compli
ment paid for its untiring efforts to
give the people an up-to-date news
paper, is a dividend, hence, it renews
its efforts and Increases its facilities
to do better the next time.
A great many compliments have
been paid the Globe on its two edi
tions concerning the recent Tennes
see tour by the Washington party and
the tourists. From far and near has
come the approbation "Well done."
A letter from Mr. Emmett J. Scott,
private secretary of Dr. Washington,
speaks in the same tone as does one
from Mr. Chas. II. Moore, Organizer
of the National Negro Business
League, while scores in Nashville
like Dr. C. V. Roman, J. C. Napier, J.
Thomas Turner, R. H. Boyd, A. N.
Johnson, D. Wellington Berry, J. D.
Crenshaw, Preston Taylor, C. H.
Clark, W. S. Ellington and many oth
ers, have been unstinted in their
praise for the accuracy with which
the entire trip through Tennessee
was reported and detailed through
the Globe; and how the entire paper
seemed to be bent on one object, and
that was making the tour and the ef
forts of the promoters a signal suc
cess. Such remarks and such atten
tion to the efforts of any paper can
but gratfully be acknowledged.
