Tie President thinks that the liberal cu
itiigeinent of tie pension law should sug
gest a more ci.relul scrutiny of bills for
special relief.
: The beet-stigar industry is declared to
Law cßsstu the stages ot experiment and
in i v lie regarded as a complete success.
The McKinley tariff is discussed at some
length. The Tresident deprecates the idea
..of subjecting Ihe act to Important changes
u-.tli it has beeu fairly tried. There is, he
says, "neither wisdom not Justice inthe
suggestion that the subject of tariff revision
sll sill be opened before this law has had a
f.iir trial." The reciprocity clause in tbe
la; ill wisely opens the way to secure a
larger reciprocal trade in exchange for
the iree admission to our ports of certain
products.
The President also makes an argument in
fayor of "fiee and honest elections." He
.: reviews the law now* ia force providing for
Federal supervision of Congressional elec
'ions and points out wherein the measure
pri|.o-ed ami passed by the House is more
effectitre without beiug in any sense an
exercise of new uower.
.-The message as a whole shows lhat the
President is master of the details of the
■ Government, lie has the lonriigeof his
'. convictions and does not hesitate to sup
port them with argument. Even those who
may not agree witb his cnnihi-d'nns will ad
mit tiie force of his rensouiug and the com
prehensive intelligence with wliich his views
are presented.
ir SI ILL l-IVI'.M.
A Democratic contemporary prints a
table showing the number of Republican
I.epiestntatives in e:,ch Congress since the
election of N. P. Him!. - as Speaker of the
Thirty-fourth Congress, and diaws from the
fact that the lb publican representation
Is smaller in the Kilty-second Congress than
in any preceding Congress since tlio party
was organized tbe Inference that the party is
"ct ining out a*, the little md of Uie horn."
In the Thiil" -fifth Congress the Kepub
heanshad but 92 members, five mot e than
are elassid as Ucpiiblicans in the Fifty
second. In (lie Tbirly-scventh they were
down to 100, in the Thirty-eighth to 108, in
the Forty-fourth to 108, but they survived all
these defeats. There is a good deal of hu
man nature in the Republican party. It
litis carried on the Government so long that
it a-sunies it will he continued in charge,
and at times ceases to put forth Its
strength. It was entirely within the
power of the members of the lb-pub
lican party to have elected a majority
uf the Kifty-second Congress. Ibe party
that (lid elect a majority polled a smaller
vole Uian in l-tis, when it lost both Presi
dent and Congress. Theie is nothing to
show that any ((iii'iderflble number of He
publicans voted witli the Democrats, or that
any considerable number would huve voted
with (he Democrats if they had* voted. The
returns sbow that about IH percent of the
Republican voters did not vote. The Dcui
i.exits polled wittihi 8 per cent of their vote
in JtrttiS, and thus carried the Hoiise. The
lb-publican patty has simply received the
check wbicli in times past lias inspired It to
win its greatest victories.
CHANGING FUO.M.
The Sacramento Record-Union has, since
the election, shown a disposition to get on
the free-trade side of the tariff question. It
quotes from the St Louis Qlobe-Democrat
to show that it is in good company. It might
also quote from the Chicago Tribune, the
Springfield Republican, the Providence
Journal and other Eepubllcan journals. It
is well known that there are Eepubllcan
journals which are not in favor of a protec
tive tariff as there are Democratic papers
Which are. When one quotes from the New
York Sun to show a Democratic opinion of
: free trade one does not assume that the
party is changing fronton the tariff ques
tion. Un sectional questions the Ulubc
}), mocrai is a good enough Kepubiiran. The
same may be said of the Chicago lYt&une.
But neither of these excellent papers lias
for years been in sympathy with tbe B pub
lican party on its tariff legislation. The l.e
--1 üblicnn party cannot be charged with
Changing front on the strength of evidence
that three or four Republican journals con
tinue to express the views they have aiways
held.
TAXATION IN FItANCE.
To tiie Ainericau observer, tho financial
situation ot some foreign countries is posi
tively appalling. If. Pellet m, who woulil
be called ill tills country Chairman of the
Committeo on Ways ami Menus, ban just
riled bis budget with the French Chamber,
nnd reports the aggregate debt of the French
Republic as 30,300.813,594 francs, sny $6,06*6,
--000,000. We wonder bow a people can stag
ger imlcr such ;t load of indebtedness.
When the first Napoleon was overthrown
he left France wiih a debt of some £250,000,
--i product of twenty veins of warfare.
This was quadrupled under the peaceful btri
corrupt regime of Louis XVIII, Charles X
and Louis Philippe. Tho republic nf ISIS
fouud an existing indebtedness of about
$1,000,090,000. This wns more than doubled
under "Kapoleon ILL The present republic
had to deal with it national debt of about
£2,500,000,000. lt purßued precisely the op
posite policy to the one which we have
folio wed in this country ; instead of reduc
ing tho debt, ii has enormously increased it.
Three years ago, ita total was nekonedat
5J4, 700, 000,000, and now M. Pelleion -jives it
a . $6,000,1 100,01 I', more thau three times the
debt of the United Slates.
To pay the interest on tbis debt, and to
defray the cost of a large amy and navy
maintained with a view to a future war with
Germany, the French are taxed at the rate
of $20 per head per yearfor the entire popu
late ii, an.l all sorts of annoying imposts,
such as taxes on doors and windows, and
salt, and Other necessaries of life, are main
tained. Our taxation in this country fur Fed
eral purposes is about SU per head per an
num. Hut i tire Dtri button for the support
of the Federal lioveriiuient and for tiie pay
ment of interest on the national debt leaves
an annual surplus of about. 1100,000,000,
while the annual deficit of French budgets
does no! average much less than that sum,
1 1 c 820 which every French man, woman
and child has to contribute yearly for the
support uf the General Government dues not
cover tbe communal taxes. Paris a ione has
a debt of $500,000,000, and interest on this
Mini must be provided by local taxation.
Parisians are likewise called upon to fur
nish a laige annual riiiii for the support of
ihe vt ry leifect but somewhat expensive
gov. nuiKiit i f the municipality. It is grand
io he a citizen of the finest city in the world,
hut the grandeur comes high.
Judging ircm our point if view, in the
light if our experience, we should be iu
clined to think tbat ti.e ciedit of a country
so burdened with debt as France, aud in
which the rrte of taxation was so heavy,
could not be very gocd. There is a limit
beyond which the car aelty of a people to
pay taxi - t mnoi be pushed. Bat it seems
thnt, in the opinion of Europe, that limit
bas net been reached in France. The
revenue is collected ;i less f. st than the
Cnited Stales Government has lo pay, and
the republic can borrow all the mouey it
v. ;•!;;- at -1 t r ''_ per ceut. The French are
tin r ost thrifty and in money matters Uie
most careful people in the world, but they
w ill tt.l.i u.t iii savings out of the old stock
ing to lend it to tbe Government of the day
— whatever it may lu — at 1 per cent.
i he gtow ih of the French ilcl.t and ofthe
communal debts has had this effect: from
being the cheapest country in tire world to
live in it Iras become one of the dearest,
Paris i- now probably the most expensive
metropolis iv Europe. Forty years ago
stmlen ts crime up from the country to fol
-1 w a course ol law or medicine at l'r.iis.
antl lived or. 60t)or fiOO francs, say $120 or
• 1 10, a year. Now, if they cannot command
an Income ot at least twice that amount
tiiey must stint their food and wear old
clothes. A family in Paris used to live
comforts! ly on $1000 a year; now they are
pinched if tbey have only rjr-UtX). Taxation
does tell ill the end.
VVOItI I>'S r.VIlt M.IiTEHS.
Some iiionlhs aizo Congres*i appointed a
ct mmittee to look into the manner in which
trie bnsinecs of the Wcild's Fair is be
ing conducted. Congressman EUvswell P.
Flower, who was a n.ein lur of the com
mlltee, sin-Dt a week in Cil b ago in tho per
f.nnaiii c of his dutier-, and on his return to
New York said to a reporter that tbe Na
tl nal Commission was altogether too large
and too costly a body to I c •■ f any use to
the projei tins of the fair, 'i'he Commission
now numbers lOfi men aiul US women. Mr.
Flower ts 'reported as saving: "1 am op
posed to the idea of |,i'ni!ittiii!i snob a body
to haiii'ier the Chicago 13. aid of Fair Di
rectors with tt coiii;ii"iida'.io!is an.l diverse
views and to draw big salaries from the
Congressional appropriation of Si,."iii-,000,
Which Should be applied ti> the legitimate
purposes of the fair. 1 believe that it
would lie better for Chicago if tho National
Commission should appoint a sub-com
mittee of five good men to supervise the
election of the buildings antl the work gen
erally of tbe local board. This would stop
Many salarii-s, and Chicago would In; en
r.hled to go on wiih the preparations for the
fair in her own way and Willi her own
money."
'J here nre probably a good many people
i f .".ir. Fkwer's way of thinking. Of what
pi s-iijje us( . j,i-,. ji(j i| lf n Hril ] ug women 18

of Directors, who really have" the work and

rectot-General Davis appears npon later in
telligence to look to tire National Commis

authority, lt is determined that the Di

bun aus, and that any differences whi.ch
nray arise shall be referred to a Board of
Joint Control ci mpised of an untal num
ber of men from the "National Commission
ers and from the local directory. There
does not stem to be any head to the man-
Bgement, notwithstanding ihe 221 persous
who constitute the National Commission.
Tbe fiist thing done was tc vt te tne Presi

II alf a down em imonsly rich railroad men
bave given the Farmers' Al.iance ample
ground upon which to stand without rdvo
catfng nieastires which wiil cause a coiiiliina
tion of (rther classes against them. Haifa
dozen men, who have made an average of
SJjO.OOO.OOO eacli, nnstiy from railroads, have
oriranizt d lo secuie for their railroad piop
erly higher rates of remuneration. Sir. Jay
Guild, who bas made not much less ilian
$100,01)0,000 in thirty years out of railroads,
is much distressed lest competition among
roads reduces the profits of ruuning them
so that they will not pay the usual per cent
on watered stock. Tho ICocKefellers, who
are but a little in the rear of Mr. Gould as
money-makers and fully abreast with him
in the remorseless execution of plans to
shutout competition, put their rjl 1*0,000,000
into a combination which, if successful, will
make an independent railtoad in the United
Slates impossible. Huntington and Stan
fi.id have gone into tiie HUM combination.
Possibly they could not help it; probably
tbey did not wish to; in either case the mag
nitude of the interest working for one end
inspires a feeling of alarm all through the
country. The live men whose names we
have mentioned own comparatively little of
the property of the country. They work on
the caucus system, which authorizes a m.i

OITtAV ANU -sr-CLUITIES.
Concerning the causes and consequences
of financial panics tho Epoch says:
So long as pioiuolers aie allowed to spend say
55,000,000 to build a piece cf ratlToarJ, and tlien
to slap on It, lor extiinple, 58.000.000 of first
moi tgrigtr bonds, $5,000,000 of second-mort:-age
bonds, $5,000,000 of piclened slock and SIO,
--000.000 ot common stock— or, In other words,
828,000,000 of securities which repteseiit only
'►5,000,000 of outlay —so long will panics
Uneaten Wall stieet.
When a few railroad men complain that
railroads are not remunerative they mean
that they do nut pay 0 per cent on all the
various forms nf slocks aid bonds that bave
been issued. They do not mean that the
mads do not pay interest on the actual in
vestment, but that tho holders of these se
curities ate not paid dividends or interest.
These bonds are sold by the promoters on
the representation that they will pay some
thing more thi.n interest on the money in
vested. Probably none of the bonds me
sold at par, but they are worked off on a
confiding public on the promise th.tt interest
will be paid on the face value. An investor
may pay §75 for a Sioo bond, but he expects
to' get luterest ou the SIUO the bond purports
to be worth. The enormous profits of the
promoters are readily seen. They are sup
posed to invest $."i.oo'J,u>o of real money and
to issue in one form and another securities
to the amount of $2ci,0(j0,000. If they got
face value for these securities their profits
would he $28,000,000 minus So, 000, 000 of
original outlay. Put the promoters are usu
ally willing to divide profits with the bond
buyer. Put if we allow the promoters to
sell bonds at au average of 60 per cent there
will be a profit of Siii.MOo.OtO oil au outlay of
lii.OOO.OQO. it Is quite Within the province
of law to limit the amount of bonds and
stick that may be Issued on a given outlay.
