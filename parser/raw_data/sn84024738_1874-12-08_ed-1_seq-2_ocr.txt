Tbe .President bad hoped &. at by t&e
meetiDg of Congress negotialioae with Spase
wonld be concluded. He therefor:: says littie
about indemnity pendiDg negotiaSione,
i FUjAJtflAL.
ThePrcsident recommends .resumption at
tbe earliest practicable day, but does u?ot be
lieve tbat tbis can be as early as ilie 1st of
January, 1??6. "Without naming .* da.?, be
thinks it tbe duly of Congress to do^o. He
advises tbe repeal of the .legal-tendc; cU.Wfie
of the currency act, and iKges tbat the Sec ro
tary of tbe Treasury be ecipower^d to bay
gold, from and after the.day, fixed fo? i&e re
sumption, by the issuance of bonds. As a
contemporary measure of assistance, he ad
vises tbat the receipts of Government shculd
be in excess of expenditures ia order to cup
port resumption. Economy, *in all depart
ments is pressed as proper on the occasion,
and, if necessary, increased duties on imposts
is advised. [Pretty good "fcard-moue$T "
policy.]
FRZE RANKING.
The President thinks that with <tbe retort
of specie payments banking should be free.
Billbolders should be protected^ in the
present-banking law; Jbut there Should be
no limitation to tbe currency. Tb^-oommu
nity itself should determine what amount is
required for business, instead of leaving it
to the Executive, Secretary of tha Treasury,
and Congress. Regulation^ however, should
be provided -suited to the resumption spe
cie payments for tbe government of t&nks.
The President recommends tbat Congress
shall not interfere with the currency .act
passed last wintec.
JNT&RN'AL IM?ROVKKJJB?TS.
The President abftains from .making auy
recommendations with regard to interna!
improvements by the General {government.
He refers to the documents brought out by
the investigations of committees ?jd the sur
veys of engineers in relation io several
routes. Some of these accompany ithe mes
sage.
LOKi&UNA AND /3KANSA8.
The President recountstbc occurrences in
Arkansas, and gives the reasons Cor his
declining to interfere in tbe recent .diffi
culties in tbat State. l$e recurs to
the factB recited in his message of Feb
ruary, 18T3 in regard to Louisiana? bit
submission of the whole question to Con
gress, and his informing that bady that in
default of aetion by & on the aybjcct he
should act according to tke dictates of his own
judgment, recognizing thegovernmeat which
was recognized and upheld by the eocirts of
the State ? i. e.t the Kmj-qg# government.
Tbe President again tobmits th? question to
Congress, and assures tbem that be will con
tinue to act as be has beretofo&s done unless
controlled by Congress. [But is there aDy
necessity for this acting at all f]
THfl JKWAKg.
General Quant renews bis rseemmeuda
tlon of tbe peace policy [too late for Captain
Jack], and thinks ir that policy be maintained
.It will soon end troubles on tbe border.
(But the guns which ended Captain Jack's
life were not Quaker guns.]
C1V1L-SEBV1CB REFORM.
The message claims benefits from civil
service reform? tbat it has elevated the ca
pacity and tone of appointments, &ct; bu>
it Is impossible to continue tbis reform with
out the direct support of Congress. [We
shoukl think so. And tbat direct support
can never be bad.]

(is that Uvo-thirds ?) in a<four per cent, in

'tbe interest on so mnch <of .the State debt

<Thi> we suppose to be a .correct view of

T*. Jfaiwow Giflwe.^1
? The question of^trilrmid gaujje.lws within:
the last few jears attracted the serious i at
tention o t some* Of the^ ^bfest/ni cd^ of
Europe and America. The subject, though
stityTtttctEBefl; las never bwu ilefitiitgtyTSe*'
cided., Though very many valuable ;biQte,
suggestions, andf facts have thus been -ob
tained, the few trials ttyfc have been made
have given to the railroad world the safest
data upon wbicfci to ^decide for theftittire
The time was la this country wbeo Abe
broad, or six-foot, gauge had strong patroiw,
tad, springing dp on all sides, we beheld
men - whOj advocated the.i *5.6-foot, * the
4-foot, the 4>I (Hoot, &?. Roads were ^uilt
during the enthusiasm of the times on,
all of- these patterns. Years of trial have
proven to the moat of, them their Failure, as
shown by .7 the example of the Erie, > the
Atlantic and. Great Western, the Mississippi
and Ohio, and other*. Duriag all this time
the question has. beep, ably discussed and
settled by railroad men. This fact is proven :
most it apt all such road?; either have re
duced or are seeding the means to reduce to
the 4^-Eoot gauge. The :4^J-foot seems to
have been hit upon, as it were, by accident, as
best suited to the heavy, traffic of this country ;
and we find that at least five-sixths of ail
our iwds are built te that standard,- That
thla gauge is best for a> railroad we do not
presume to say; it is yet an open, question
Just where to place the proper medium .-be
twoen the bread' and narrow systems, so as
properly to combine all the good qualities of
both. As the 4.8J foot is in the ascendant,: it
is just probable . it .will never be decided*
With railroads, as elsewhere, majorities gen-;
trolly rule, and as the 4'8?*fopt is just now.
in the ascendant its advocates exert power
ful influence- upon all 'contemplated new
lines, holding as it were the keys of trade
and connectiou?forto break bulk means to
lengthen your line. Of late years Btrong'ad
vocates for narrow: gauges have sprung up.
Like their brethren, the broad-gauge-men,
they take the field with a diversity of %.G,3j
or 4-foot; and in this particular at leafit
the extremes meet. The 8-foot seems
to have taken the firmest foothold in this
country, its advocates claiming for it cheap
ness in first eost of construction, the advant
age of heavier eurvea and grades^ a carrying
capacity in excess of the i 4.8J-foot roads in -
proportion to the weight of its trains, and
generally a much cheaper train-expense.
Whatever may be that bappv medium, expe
rience has proven that the 3-foot gangs does
not meet its requirements, nor does it come
up to the standard its friends bad hoped for.
If thoughtful persons will stop to consider
its claims It will be found that they are only
partially true; as proven by lines already
built. How often we see it asserted In the
papers that such roads cost only ?ne-balf as
much as the broader gauges? a statement,
not strictly Irue, which leads to serious er
rors wbeie large sums of money are con
cerned. To make a good track for a 4.8 J-foot
road requires its cuts to be 18 feet at the bot
tom, Its banks 14 feet at the top, its ties at
least 8 feet long, and its rails to weigh from'
56 to 67 pounds per yard. To make a good
traak for a 8-foot road requires its cuts to be
from 12 to 13 feet at the bottom, its
banks from 9 to 10 feet at the top, its ties
from 6 to 7 feet long, and its rails to weigh
from 30 to 50 pounds to the yard. The
bridge-masonry and superstructure Is nearly
the same in both, the culverts alone being
shortened to suit the banks. Hence it has
beea found that the three foot roads cost
about three-fifths as much as the 4.8J-foot
roads, and generally overrun these figures.
As to curves and grades, a certain force Is
required to move a ton of freight around a
curve or up a grade; increase either, and
you must increase your motive power or de
crease your load in proportion. All a nar
row-gauge can do here is to lighten its loads
proportionate to the size and capacity of its
engines; and this the broad-gauge has it fully
ip its power also to accomplish. Seven
eighths of all the roads In this country shame-,
fully abuse their motive power and road
beds. In every direction you see fine en
gines laboring under heavy loads of old,
rickety, badly-built cars, which are allowed
to jerk and bump them at .will, and, for
want of springs, to pound and thump
away at the track until it is hardly pass
able. You read oa the cars, "capacity
2,000 pounds, weight 22,900 pounds";
that if, for every ton of freight these cars can
bold that engine must haul a little more than
a toh of car as dead load, aggravated by the
immense friction of bad couplings, bad
wheel*, bad breaks, bad trucks, and absence
of springs. Is it a wonder that these en
gines are half the time in the repair-shop?,
or that jails and ties are constantly needing
renewal, and that a small army of trackmen
must be constantly employed ? And. with it
all, the engine*, only half loaded, are puffing
and steaming up and down our moderate
grades. A 27-ton engine on a straight roa j,
in good repair, can move at ttierate of 10 or
12 miles an hour on a level about 1,400 tons
exclusive of itself and tender :ou a grade
of 10 fret to the mile, about 900 tons ; 50 feet
to the mile, about 350 tons ; while at 100 feet
to the mile, only about 200 tons. In practice,
trains enn be made to weigh only about one
half the above figures, a precaution .neces
sary for proper control, for increase of speed
should it be necessary, for wiuds, lor curves,
slippery rails, &e., making no allowance for
bad cars or bad track. So that on a grade of
100 feet to the mile a train weighing 225
tons, of which 75 tons only would be freight,
ail that can be expected of an ordinary
heavy engine is to move at the rate of 12
milesan hour. '
Mr. Jauret, superintendent of the United
States Rolling-Stock Company, as a first ex
periment- produced a car for his company
weighing 22,125 pounds, while its carrying*
capacity was 18 gross tons^for small grain,
16 gross tons? thus reducing the dead load
and Increasing the freight capacity of sUeb a
train 60 to 80 per cent. Let railroad compa
nies reduce the weight of their locomotives
and cars, throw all the weight of the farmer
on their drivers, and so construct the latter
as to obviata slack, excessive friction , &c. , as
far as possible, while their capacity is in
creased, and they will rob the narrow gauge
of its strongest claims. Do this, and we may
hope to see lighter rails, better roads, and
heavier train-loads, and a corresponding de
crease in train-expenses.
The narrow-gauge roads may do well as
feeders, but their points of greatest useful
ness are such as lateral coal or iron-roads, to
supply furnace?, Ac., in new countries .where
freights are not likely for year9 to grow up
to a broader gauge. For trunk lines, or
where a country is to be opened up to an in
creasing trade, they will ever be failures.
Many roads started after tbia pattern are
cbaDging to the 4.8J-foot.
The question with Richmond is simply
this Is 6be able now to try expensive ex
periments which may never give her that
benefit she so much desires from the South
and West? Has not Richmond been a sufficient
sufferer already from a difference in gauge,
and does she seek to bring another element
of discord into her already unfortunate rail
road system? Surely it would be unwise in
the capital of the richest mineral State in the
Union to fritter away her means on any such
fcchemea when matters of so much importance
are demanding her necessary aid. Let her util
ize her great canal system and her expensive
Ohio road by filling up that thirty vacant miles
contemplated by the James River railroadi
tbWtgh the richest iron mines on this conti*
nanf, either by prolonging her cant to rbuild
iog a railroad. Then, if she want* to buiid
a narrow-gauge read, let her begin at the
head of ber ?*aa1 and follow what is known
as the Haupt survey, and open up a rich
mineral regies that will pay both State and
city abundantly.
To put such a road into Bicbmond aa the
proposed Trans-Alleghany Narrow-Gauge
railroad will only add to her misery. An
immediate connection between Bicbmond
and Clifton Forge is her great want, and
this connection she ought to secure at any
COfit. ' Ji0lT>TJdL\'KEa. a
