Dakota Land Business.
The present amount of vacont Govern
ment land, not including Indian reserva
tions, subject to original entry in Dakota,
is estimated by the Commissioner of Im
migration at 18,500,000 acres. In the Bis
marck District alone there are over 12,500,
000 acres in the Devil's Lake District,
nearly 4,000,000 acres in the Deadwood
(Black Hills) District, about 700,000 acres,
and in the Aberdeen District, about 600,000
acres.
The Huron Land District, with linrdly
50,000 acres of untaken land, will be
classed for 1887 among the relinquishment
districts—embracing the Yankton, Mitchell,
Watertown, Fargo and Grand Forks Dis
tricts—where the new filings are on lands
previously taken up, which are relinquished
by others or contested for valid causes.
The Legislature having changed county
boundaries so often of late, the settler in
any one of a dozen counties has to locate
himself by town and range lines in order to
tell which land district he is in. To rem
edy this difficulty, and as a matter of pro
priety and convenience, the Commissioner
of Immigration is endeavoring to have the
land district boundaries changed so as to
conform to existing county lines. The
number of new entries during September
at the nine United States Land Offices
named in the table was 952, within two of
as many as reported for the entire ten dis
tricts in the Territory for the previous
month. Estimating the new business of
the Mitchell office, which is not included in
the table, to have been only the same as for
August, viz, seventy filings, would make
the total for September 1,022 new entries, a
fair increase over the midsummer month.
The total area newly filed at the nine offices
reporting was 144,153 acres, and of land
acquired by proof and cash entry, 84,655
acres. The table for September is as fol
lows:

to authorize the construction of a bridge
across the Mississippi Itiver. In the

of tlio Speaker's gavel, a livoly sc-enc win pre
sented by the members receiving congratula
tions or condolence from each other ovor their
success or defeat in the lato canvass. Hon. S.
S. Cox VIM presented and qualified HB the suc
cessor of Mr. Pulitzer. Mr. ('ox's ro-eutry into
legislative life was grectod vtfith rounds of ap
plause from the members of both sides. Tlio
reading of the President's message was atten
tively listened to until that portion relating to
tlio tariff was reached, when, it is said, interest
slackened. The death of tho late Congressmen
from New York.whs announced, a9 alsotbntof
Mr. Price, of Wisconsin, ill respect for whom tho
House adjourned.
IN the Sonato, Tuesday tho 7th inst., Mr. Beck
introduced a bill to provide for the retirement of
United States legal tender and national bank
notes of small denomination, and for the issue
of coin certificates Mr. Van W.vck, a bill to ex
empt from duty imported sugar and molasBes,
boards, lumber and timber llr. Morrill, a reso
lution to the effect that any further attempts by
the present Congress nt revision of the tariff in
a spirit of fairness to all interests would
bo inexpedient and detrimental to the re
vival of trade Mr. Dawes, a resolution In
structing tho finance committee to inquire as to
what specific reduction can lie niiule in the cus
tom duties and internal revenues. In the
House. Mr. Adams, of Illinois, presented a bill

Caldwell, of Tennessee, called up the electoral
count bill, which was tho special continuing or
der. Mr. Hatch, of Missouri, opposed its con
sideration, but the House, by a vote of 101 to 27,
decided to consider it. Mr. Caldwell advocated
the bill, explaining that its object was to pre
scribe the mode in which tho count of tho elec
toral vote was to bo made, and to supply the
omission which existed in tho Constitution
that the bill would place the jiower to count the
vote with the two liousds of Congress, and not
with the President of tho Senate.
An Iowa Coucrcssinan Resigns.
Congressman Frederick, of tlio Fifth Dis
trict of Iown, bus forwarded bis resignation
from Washington io Gov. Larrabee, to
take effect upon the election of his suc
cessor. Mr. Frederick, in a letter to Pres
ident Cleveland, assigns bis reasons for re
signing as follows:
After an outrageous gerrymander by tho Re
publican party of the State of Iowa, in which a
district was created with 7,( 00 republican ma
jority, I accepted the nomination and was
elected to the Forty-ninth Congress. I accepted
renomination, and in tho olection just passed
would have boen re-olected but for tlio fact that
I was sick in bed during the entire campaign, I
was dofoated by less than 700 votes. In June
last, your Postmoster-General invited me, as tho
member of Congress in whose district the oSco
was located, to liamo a man for tho position at
Iowa City. This I did by recommending a Dem
ocrat indorsed by fifty leading Democratic busi
ness men of Iowa City and over 200 of her fore
most Democratic citizens. There wcro other
candidates seeking tho office, one of whom I be
lieve had the indorsement of Mr. Murphy. What
was my surprise, while on route to Washington,
to read in the press reports that George Paul,
recommended by Mr. Murphy, had been ap
pointed Postmaster at Iowa City, instead of the
man I had named. I have been in Washington
three days, have called at the Executive Man
sion, and have been uuulile to see you, and I
take this method of coinimmieuting to you tho
information of wliat to me is tho most "painful
act of liiv life. I have forwarded to the Governor
of my State my resignation of my seat as a
member of the Forty-ninth Congress, to take ef
fect upon the election of my successor. I have
boen forced to this course to maintain my self
respect and by tho indignity thrust upon me by
your Postmaster-General.
Up to July 1 last Iowa City was in the
district which Mr. Frederick was elected to
represent, but under the new nrrengernenl
of Congressional Districts it is within the
limit of Judge Murphy's district. The
Postmaster-General has, therefore, taken
the advice of Murphy, instead of that of
Frederick, in the selection of the Iowa
City Postmaster.
A Slick Swindler.
For several days prior to the 3d inst.
great excitement prevailed in the City of
Mexico over the sale of tickets at tho Na
tional theatre for the Patti season of live
nights in January. The populace had
nearly gone wild over tho expected advent
of the great songstress. Seats sold at S50
and six times their ordinary price, and
some persons paid $1,000 for boxes. In
the course of one day—Thursday last—the
box office had taken in $18,600, while the
day previous private sale amounted to
$6,300. The ostensible agent conducting
the 6ale, a man giving his name as Mayer,
had with him various letters, some
of which he showed to Minister
Manning and others, and since' the
theater had been previously engaged for a
season of Putti, it is no wonder that tlie
music-loving people of the city were un
suspicious of tho smooth swindle being
perpetrated upon thorn. The Governor of
the federal district, it appears, thought
possibly all might not be well, and sent to
Mayor to inquire who was responsible for
the large amount of money being taken
from the public, but Mayer managed to
avoid contact with the Governor, or any
net that would further arouse suspicion.
Thursday night, Mayer went to his hotel,
accompanied by a policeman, whom Mayer
supposed was appointed to guard him and
his cash on the way, but whose duty in re
ality was to see that he deposited all the
money in the hotel safe. In some ingeni
ous way Mayer transferred over $20,000 in
National bank bills to the pockets of his
overcoat, deluding the policeman into be
lieving all had been placed in the safe.
Mayer was then permitted to go to his
room. The next morning he failed to put
in an appearance at the box office. The
safe was opened, and only $4,300 in silver
dollars was found, which of course conld
not be taken away. While the deluded
people are refusing to be comforted, the
authorities are trying to find Mayor. An
accomplice has been arrested at Orizaba,
wliiHioi "lie had fjono ost- lisil iy to arrange
for e\eur,sious to the entcrfaiiiin Mits. It is
claimed Mayer i* an American, but lie
Hjtoke English with a marked broken ac
cent, and had a nam oast of coun
tenance.
A Drsortcr Afro.r Rack i'ay.
William linapp deserted from the First
United States Cavalry during the war,
while on duty at New Orleans. He eluded
aires!, and some years ago settled with his
family at Grovetown, Ind. It recently oc
curred to him that he could obtain back
pay, and lie wrote to Washington, asking
for information in regard to obtaining it, at
the same time detailing the circumstances
of his desertion. He was informed that be
could get no back pay uutil tho taint of de
sertion was removed. He accordingly de
cided to go to Chicago and surrender him
self, believing that ho would be released
without much trouble, owing to tho length
of time which lias elapsed since his deser
tion. He walked into the cavalry recruit
ing office and informod the officer in charge
of the circumstances. He was at once
placed under arrest and taken to jail,
where he awaits the action of the War De
partment.
To Increase Soldierp.' Pensions.
Senator Ingalls last Tuesday introduced
the following bills amendatory to the pen
sion laws: To increase the pension for tho
loss of an eye to $30 per month, and for
the partial loss of sight to a proportionate
amount to increase the pension for the
loss of one hand or foot, or for total disa
bility of the same, to $35 per month for
the loss of an arm within five inches of or
above the elbow joint, or the loss of a leg
within six inches of or above the knee
joint, or total disability of the same, to $40
per month, and for the loss of an arm
within six inches of the shoulder joint, or a
leg within eight inches of the hip joint, to
$45 per month also providing that the
pensions of all persons now on the pension
rolls, and all persons hereafter granted
pensions by special act of Congress, shall
commence from tho date of discharge from
the service of the United States, provided
the disability was contracted in the line of
duty in the service of the United States.
Crooked Work in Gotham.
NEW YOKK, Dec. 2.—Judge Douobue, of
the supreme court, has granted attachments
against the property of Auton liivers, of 50
Lispenard street, arrested last night on
complaint of his former bookkeeper, Clif
ford Kemp. Kemp charges that Rivers
ordered him as bookkeeper to change the
accounts of the business so as to show as
sets to the amount of $300,000, when in
reality there were only $8,000 worth.
Kemp alleges that this was done with in
tent to obtain $36,000 insurance by setting
the place on fire. Kemp was to receive
$3,000 for the job, and he claims the insur
ance adjuster was paid $4,000 to give a
favorable report.
Outrage on Americans in Mexico.
Last Tuesday morning a man arrived at
El Paso, Texas, on tho Mexican Central
Railroad from Chihuahua, who tells a tale
of outrage in that city. Tho man is Rev.
T. Rappaport, a Jewish Rabbi in ill health.
The Jewish people of El Paso raised money
to send him to the City of Mexico, where
he says he has brothers. Rappaport says
he stepped off at Chihuahua on the 3d inst.,
and after going about the streets for a
while with an American, they returned to
their hotel. Soon afterwards an officer
came in and arrested them, charging them
with being revolutionists, and took tlieni
before a magistrate. Rappaport says an
officer went, through his pockets and took
$48. He showed his papers to the magis
trate, who thereupon discharged him, but
kept the $48 for costs. He says the Ameri
can refused (o pay anything and appealed
to the American Consular agent, who said
he had no authority beyond commercial af
fairs, so the American went to jail where
he now is. Consul B'ngham will investi
gate the matter and report to the State de
partment.
The Irish Kent War.
A London special says: Reductions of
rents in Ireland are going on rapidly, and
landlords continue to submit, one after an
other, while a number of tenants are' ex
hibiting a willingness to accept reasonable
terms. The tenants of Lord Gough and
Lady Belew have accepted a reduction o".
15 per cent. Those of the O'Callaghan,
Duckett, and French estates have refused
a 20 per cent reduction and demand 30,
and have adopted a plan of campaign on
this basis. The Duke of Leinister's ten
ants have purchased their holdings at an
eighteen years' computation, which is equal
to a reduction of 20 per cent.
A score of Parnellito members of Parlia
ment attended demonstrations in all parts
of the country yesterday to advocate their
plan of campaigns if the reductions of rent
demanded are refused. Many landlords
are yielding to this organized agitation,
wliile others stubbornly hold out and de
mand that the Government shall take vig
orous action to enforce the regular rentals.
Suit Against Ben Itut.Ier.
In the United States Circuit Court at
Boston, on the 3d inst., the jury returned a
verdict of $16,537 against Gen. B. F. But
ler and in favor of the National Soldiers'
Home. The suit was to recover $lo,000
alleged to have been unaccounted for by
Gen. Butler as former Treasurer of the
Home. The declaration alleged that on
Nov. 20, 1885, Gen. Butler was given
$15,000, which payment is not accounted
for, although ths amount has been charged
by the defendant as a credit in his accounts
with plaintiff. Gen. Butler claims to have
paid the Home in lull all sums of money
which at any time he owed it. Prentice
Cummings, plaintiff's attorney, states that
on Gen. Tilton's books the transaction
concerning the $15,000 was not entered,
and when it was vaid that fact was not en
tered. He claims Gen. Butler, when

THE Catholics of Lut'gan, County Ar
magh, Ireland, formed a procession last
