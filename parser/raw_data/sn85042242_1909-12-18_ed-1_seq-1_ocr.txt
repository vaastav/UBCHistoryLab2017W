WITNESSES FOR THE DEFENSE
GIVE LIE TO THE DRUNK-
ARD STORY.
Looked Like Reconcilation at One
Time During the Day Mrs. Bro
kaw Accused of Using Profane
Language and Does Not Demy the
Truth of the Statement.
(By Associated Press.)
New York, Dec. 17.—Mrs. Mary
Blair fctokaw* the plaintiff, rested
her case today at Mineola, L. I.,
where she Is suing for separation
with alimony of 60,00 a year from
her husband, W. Gould Brokaw. The
defense opened. Mrs. Brokaw has
been her own principal witness and
there is speculation if her husband is
to play a part equally prominent-for
the defense.
"We cannot say yet" said John P.
'Mclntyre, Mr. Brokaw's counsel.
"He may take the stand in his own
behalf later."
Prospects for a reconciliation be
tween the husband and the wife
brightened today for a moment when
Mr. Mclntyre tendered Mrs. Brokaw
an invitation to the New Years cake
walk at High Point, N. the Bro
kaw southern country place. Bro
kaw smiled and his wife hid her face
in her furs, but during recess he de
fined his position as one of frank hos
tility.
"Mrs. Brokaw" he said, "has re
jected my advances often enough. I
am going to fight this suit to a finish
and I am well satisfied with its ad
vance."
Mrs. H. Bracwell Gilbert, Brokaw's
sister, testified in his behalf that he
and his wife were a "Sweet, tender,
solicitous and loving couple."
Mrs. Gilbert testified that Brokaw
was not a drinking ran.
Bagley, one of Brokaw's grooms
testified to the same effect.
Mr. Gilbert had an amusing pas
sage at arms with his sister-in-law
over a point in her earlier testimony.
Mrs. Brokaw has Refused to admit
her use of-a prbtanfe'adjective ai ap
plied to a servants Jberth in which she
said her husbandi made her sleep
while*crossing the Atlantic, unless Mr
Gilbert would swear she used it.
"Coming around the ship's deck, I
met the plaintiff face to face. I lifted
my hat and she exclaimed 'I'll be
if I occupy that berth'" tes
tified Gilbert today.
As he repeated the debatable ad
jective, Mr. Gilbert looked at the
.plaintiff. She nodded her head and
smiled. So did Justice Putnam as
she made good her word.
A crank with a wild story of brib
ed witnesses caused a momentary
flutter in the court during the after
noon session. Officers led him away
while counsel for both sides agreed
that his charges were baseless.

of John Prood, the Moffit village

twenty-one years old, and at Brittin
where he was raised he bore a good
reputation. However, when several
years since, he moved to Moffit, the
general real estate and townsite pro
motion and other get-rich quich
schemes with which the very air of
the metropolis-on-Long-lake was im

t~3v Associated Press.)
JBoston, Dec. 17.—A record crowd
was on hand in the East Cambridge
probate court to hear the story of
the North Dakota ranchman who al
leges that he is Daniel Blake Rus
sell, the long missing heir to half the
$500,000 fortune of Daniel Russell,
of Melrose, Mass., and who is making
a phenominal fight for recognition
against the most bitter declarations
and testimony that he is not the read
heir, but an imposter.
It was 2:30 p. m. when the claim
ant took the stand in his own behalf.
He said that he is Daniel Blake Rus
sell that he was born in Melrose,
Mass:, Jan. 30, 1862. He named the
birthplace of bis father and mother
and of his brother, William C. Rus
sell, who contests the claim of the
witness. He said he left home on
til last spring. The court then ad
journed. It is expected that the
ranchman's story will occupy several
days of the hearing.
Senator Leslie A. Simpson, attorney
for the claimant, sustained a severe
electric shock shortly after the court
opened. The flash of light and ac
companying explosion created a fair
sized paic. The shock wag occasion
ed by his hand short-circuiting some
wires connected with the electric
lock on the desk of the clerk of the
court. His wriBt is painfully burned,
but otherwise Mr. Simpson was un
injured, and he remained in court.
The defense also received a shock,
but of a different nature. Senator
Simpson declared that Ferdinand B.
Almy, one of the co-executors of the
Russell estate, is keeping Mrs. Han
nah Lynde, the aged aunt of Daniel
Blake Russell, under his influence.

New York, Dec. 17.—"President
Taft in his recent message to coq?
gress denies that the recent and con
stantly increasing cost of living is
ment which proves nothing so clearly
as that his training as a lawyer has
not made of him a statesman, still
less a political economist."
John Bigelow, former ambassador
to France, statesman, diplomat and
author, thus criticises the president
in a letter written to the civic forum
whose annual banquet was held in
New York tonight. Mentally alert,,
though in his ninety-second year, Mr.
Bigelow gave his views by letter be
case he was unable to attend the
banquet. The civic form, which
counts many distinguished men
among its officers, encourages the
freest utterances of opinion from its
platform.
"Of course, under these auspices"
continues Mr. Bigelow, "I see more
prospect of a revolution than of any
reform in our government. For the
last two years there has been a larger
army of wage earners on strike, that
is in revolt against their employers,
than was at any time engaged in our
civil war by the confederate states,
thus far less bloody only because of
enforced concessions to the demands
of the wage earners.
