ABANDOH OPEN PLAY IS
URGED BY ENTHUSIASTS
(By Walter 1 1. Eckorsalt
Chicago, Dec. ".Followers of col
lego football are Just now deeply Inter
ested In the modifications in the game
which the rules committee is sure to
make wh n It meets in New York this
winter.
It Is a certainty that some altera
tion must bo made in tho playing code
to appease those who are strongly op
posed to football. The season Just
closed has been prolific of more
deaths and serious Injuries than any
season since the adoption of the new
rules, four years ago. At that time
the rules committee was forced to
satisfy those who called football a
brutal sport. The first years of the
new game pleased every one. but ns
the coaches obtained better Ideas of
the possibilities of the changes, in
juries and deaths became more fre
quent, until this year the toll lias be
come so great that somthlng must
be done for (lie preservation of the
game.
Innumerable suggestions already
have been made, and the rules com
mittee will be confronted 'with tjje
hardest task it ever has experienced.
When the game was changed, in the
winter of l;i):.-ti modifications were
made to satisfy those who thought
injuries were caused by mass plays.
As a matter of fact, most serious in
jures have occurred in the open,
where two fast moving bodies have
come together. In this style of play
the man with the ball has opportunity
to gather his speed and when he ia
tackled by a player 'coming from the
opposite direction either one or both
are liable to be hurt.
In the days of mass play and line
plunges the man with the ball did
not have an opportunity to gather his
speed and when ho hit the line he
did not have the drive or momentum
of a player with a ten or fifteen-yard
start. Injuries which did occur in this
style of play were caused by careless
ness on the part ol some of the men
who allowed themselves to be caught
under a mass with their logs curled
under them or In cramped positions.
Old gladiators like Heffelflngc, Glass,
Hare Dewitt who stood the brunt
of many a hard attack, seldom were
Injured, because they never allowed
themselves to be ho caught.
If any changes are made In the
code tho committee would do well to
revert as much as possible to the old
game. When this gamo was in vogue
the players, as now, were hurt se
riously In the open and few serious
accidents happened in the middle of
the line, when the linesmen and backs
were taught correct "met hods of pro
tecting themselves.
If modifications are to be made,
one of the best ways to prevent In
juries Is to take off some of the re
strictions from the forward pas. As
tho play Is used now, the man who
receives a forward pass in the open Is
rarely protected, and this Is due to
the restrictions on the play. Any
player who Is body checked in the
open, when he is In the act of re
ceiving a pass, and when he has no
chance to protect himself, is sure to
be hurt. It is hard enough ior u play
er to get out lu thp open, let alone;
providing an Interference to protect
him.
If every man on a team were eligi
ble to receive a throw, then a means
of protecting the one to receive the
pass could be advised, and one of the
dangerous elements of the game would
be eliminated. To make every man
on the team eligible to receive the
pass It would be necessary. to abolish
the rule that the ball must be passed
live yards either side of the center.
In order to secure a more frequent
use of the pass under buch conditions
it would be a good thing to take off
the penalty for an Incompleted throw
that U. eliminate the l.Vyard pen
alty, but let the down advance, and
If the throw were incompleted on the
third attempt the ball to go to the
opponents on the spot where the throw
was made, Just r.s it is now.
This would Mieourage forward pass
ing and probably make more of the
attempts successful. It also would do
away with penalizing the teams,
which is one of the disagreeable fea
tures of the present gamn. It Is a
certainty that the coaches would de
vise a defense to protect the receiver .
of forward passes and In making ell !
glble the, linesmen, who are less pus- '
ceptlble to injuries would result. J
Many Injuries have resulted from t
laxity of ofll'iitls In enforcing pen-;
allies for unnecessary roughness, pil
ing on and tackling out of bound.
This sort of playing, entirely uncalb-d
for, can be checked readily If the of
ficials would enforce penalties for
such Infringements. A runner If tack
led when any part of the body except
his hands and feet touch the ground
Is "down" and there Is no need for
piling on or crawling.
LABOR AGENCIES STOPPED
FROfil ROBBING CLIENTS
Spokane, Wash., De. ). Labor
agencies aro prohibited from exacting
, or receiving foes of any kind as com
pensation for services rendered to la
borers in the procurement of employ,
ment by the terms of an ordinance
submitted to the city council or per
sona placing orders for labor for re
muneration. The penalty provided as
punishment for violations is flxe?d at
not more than $L'0O or six months in
jail or both.
The enactment of the ordinance,
which has no opposition in the council,
will give Spokane the distinction of
being the first city in tho United
States to legislate against dishonest
agents In this manner, the purpose
being to break up their fraudulent
practices, against which the laborer
has no lgal recourse at present.
Mayor Pratt says In bis message to
the council that the supreme court of
the state of Washington has indicated
that employment agencies are sub
ject to regulatory provisions, "and."
ho adds, "there Is no doubt that the
ordinance suggested will be sustained
by tho courts ns a proper regulation of
this business, The ordinance will give
protection to those who need unci de
serve it most, without taking away
tho profit of u business conduc ted on
legitimate lines.
"Hundreds of Individual cases have
been before me during the last six
months, and my observation has been
such that I know It is the daily prac
tice of many employment age:uies to
act fraudulently and dishonestly In
their dealings with tho laboring men
who go to them for employment."
The ordinance is based upon a fed B
erai siaiun; ror tne protection or sea
men, which declares that If any per
son demands or receives directly or
otherwise remuneration from a sea
man or any person seklng employ
ment as a seaman for providing him
with employment, ho shall for every
such offense he deemed guilty of misdemeanor.

Arrivals of quarantine cattlo hero last

cent weeks, but were considerably
heavier than a year ago at this time.
Tho market held about steady on ev

and cows ranging front $.1.23 to $4.25,
runners $2..r.O to $3.00. There was a
decline last week on fed steers in the

exclusively to those selling at $r..r0
to $G.73. The run today is light In
quarantine division hero, and is mod

of fed steers called 15 higher. In the

Today's market Is only a shade under
the best time this year, the latter part
of September when tons reached
$8.27 'i, an altitude likely to be sur
passed this week. Sentiment seems
to bo ngainst any great advance above
present level at this time, as receipts
are running almost up to the average
for tho past ten years, and while tho
number of consumers is greater, the
premium being paid above the ten

eliminate enough of the cousnmers to
