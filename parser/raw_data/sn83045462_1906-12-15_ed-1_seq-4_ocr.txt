THE STAR, or to the Editorial or Buti
ness Depiirtments, according to tenor o:
purpose.
The Green Eill.
II is evident from the published fxprrs
ions of members of the House Distric
Committee th it the hill introduced by Rep
(csentative tlreen the other day. propoxinj
the undoing of certain actions of the boai\
of education in the matter of the dismiss.!
of several teachers, has elicited a stronj
followine <n the House. These mem! er:
are quoted as declaring it to be their o?i
view that the reorganization law was in
tended to give to every teacher on tht
rolls at the time of its approval a contijiu
ous service, with the right of trial when ac
cui-'ril of Incompetence or misconduct 01
otherwise plated in jeopardy. Tiiis has
been the view of The Star from the outset
It is believed to be the view of a great ma
jority of the citizens of the District. 1.1
would seem to be the onli' view consistent
with the spirit and the circumstances o!
the legislation of last sprinsj.
It is stated by the author of the bill thai
his immediate purpose is to secure i
thorough inquiry into the condition of th<
schools, and especially into the working!
of the new law. The measure affords i
convenient medium for such an inquiry. I
id deplorable that the practical anplicatior
of the n^w statute, designed as an aid t<
the teachers and an assurance of perma
nence during good behavior, should hav<
resulted in a state of affairs calling for an
other investigation. It was hoped that th<
Uistrict was through wilh such procedtin
for a time, having suffered in its scltoo
Interests for years by constantly recurring
troubles and hearings and disputes whict
Feriously interfered with the essential wort
of building up the school system to a h!gi
state of efficiency and discipline. But il
ran not be denied that the administration
of the new law has been such as to rendei
at least one more exposition of facts necessary
if the schools are to be restored to
I ? U
urn 1111.
if it was the intention of Congress that
the board of education should hold its sessions
always in the open, and that the
teachers on the rolls last June should be
automatically continued in service during
efficiency and good behavior, and that
teachers accused of offenses or incompetence
should be given the right of formal
accusation and fair trial before dismissal,
then there is no question of tile need of another
enactment, so long as the board of
education neglects or refuses to undo the
work of the past few months, which violates
tht* i-nntrr^Hinnal intent T*ntil
tice has beta done in the schools little
progress can be made toward the ?oal ot
educational perfection. Everybody in the
schools must be assured that the i>rincipl?
of the square deal prevails. Everyone,
teacher ami pupil alike, must be g-iven unmistakable
evidence that the law is supreme.
Discipline cannot be had when fa tions
gain ascendency and work their prejudiced
ends through law perversion, misrepresentation
and injustice.
Congressional and Other Salaries.
The members of t>10 Hmwa hara
not to increase their salaries, either al
present or in the future. That is theii
right. They can Uo just as they pleas*
about the pay question. Still, it must b?
confessed that a belief lurks in the public
mind that there is a heavy majority foi
larger salaries, but that it is not suftidentlj
courageous to declare itself. The memorj
of the fate of so-called salary grabbers ir
the past has doubtless deterred a largt
number of legislators from doing what thej
believe to be justice to themselves and theii
successors.
Washington wonI I like to se the member!
of Congress increase their own salaries. II
shares in the belief that these men are nol
paid enough money. They work hard, as
a rule, and conscientiously, and few of their
can afford to stick exclusively to their congressional
work and make both ends meet
ar*? pvn^nait'ti I***"" - /'?

men as wi ll as for the common or garder
variety of citizen, anil the member of thf
House or Senate who has no private ineorm
and who hesitates about accepting law foes
or other emoluments, however clear the}
may be of commercial taint, is often hard
put to maintain a dignified appearance ir.
the world.
The capital city would be especially gratified
too if Congress would now vote for a
proper increase in the pay of the subordinate
government workers. There can b?
no possible embarrassment r.bout tackling
this proposition. It is quite safe and sane
. It comes before Congress with the prestige
of a presidential recommendation, and it Is
Justified by every consideration of fairness
to the faithful workers in the departments
who are receiving the same range of paj
iwuy iiiai iney w. re given many years
ago, while economic conditions have materially
changed to their disadvantage.
The average department c!er)t who geU
$1,600 a year now is not as well off as th<
clerk who got the same pay ten or flfteer
years ago. Yet his work has actually beet
increased. His hours are longer, his service
Is more arduous. The only Item in his
favor is that his tenure is more certain
thanks to the workings of the civil servie*
law. But certainty of tenure will not paj
house rent and clothing bills and grocerj
accounts and car fare. It will not buj
books and furniture.
Those members of the House who reallj
believe that the conditions of the time!
warrant an increase in congressional sala
ries cannot consistently turn their back:
upon this other proposition.
There are fears that the appearance ol
an actress as a factor In a shooting tragedy
will come to be considered a regulai
part of the program.
If the beef and coal people hear these discussions
of higher wages, they are likelj

A Florida Pessimist.
The Florida Times-Union, us the follow
ing shows. Is in a pessimistic moo. thesd
days:
"When we confess in our legislation thai
money can elect a President, send a i. ijority
to Congress, and fearlessly take what it
likes from the public lands, are wc so 'At'
as our forefathers were?" ?
"As long as we are what we should be,
America can laugh at the world in arms;
as soon as we are deserving of death, no
military establishment can save us."
Why, our forefathers quarreled amony
themselves Just as we are doing, and abou*
many slmljar things. In "those < Iden.
golden days" It was freely charged tint
money exerted a seandalous anil dangerous
IntMMi on pu. ic affair*. Man;- Jeffer
sortUim beUeved that Hamilton was a
grnfter. while the Hamiitonians h. d their
suspicions about Jefferson. A raon"y charge
. was rr.ad and a scandal resulted from the
choice of this town as the national capital.
Washington was one of the plutocrats of
j the time and his enemies held that his
money Quite as much as his services as a
soldier explained his election to the presif
dency.
Money has always done, ts doing now,
t and r.lways will do, far too much In shaping
public policies and ->lectlrg pubirc officials.
The appeil to It at such times la an fn[
erudicable evil-. The most we may hope to
, do is to limit 1 s use as mueh as possible:
. anil no period in our his Lory shows as
. much resolution in attacking lawless
wealth, or as s ttisfactcry results from the
. attacks, as the present. Both parties are
eniisted in the war and their leaders dis^
I pute as to the credit for what is achieved.
' In applauding Mr. Roosevelt's work. Mr.
1 Bryan wants the country to believe that he
' inspired it.
But. discreditable as this record of the
use of money is, the story, for electioneering
purposes, has often been exaggerated.
It is to be doubted if the electorate has
ever at any time been debauched as de
- J scribed. Some politicians have relied largely
t I upon monev. both in their own campaigns
- | and in those conducted for others. But,
; since Washington's day. no rich man has
t | occupied the White House, and not in a
1 1 great many years has a man known for
{ . his wealth occupied the Speaker's chair in
> | the House. So that whatever money can
i | do. it has not as yet flaunted itself in our
- | highest places of power. When the country
; i is realiv 'or sale the richest men will buy
I fi\r f i\nmciil 1'iif rttii* liimtmct h 'innrc
It is but a truism to say that when wo
become as a nation unworthy of life salt
< wop't save us. We shall in that day go
the way of all rottenness. But not only
has that day not arrived, but to the stout
t ! spirits there is no sign of its approach,
t Ours has been a rapid, but in the main a
f healthy growth, and if any nation is more
firmly on its pins than this let somebody
t point it out. And a healthy nation, with a
i great mission, needs in carrying on its work j
s a healthy, up-to-date military establish3
ment.
i
t Chinese Trade and Coolies.
i Speaking the other day about the revival
> at this session of the effort which failed at
the last session to weaken the Chinese
exclusion law, The Star referred to the
- way the Chinese boycott cf American
5 goods had been worked as a bugaboo at
? that time, and added that "our trade with
1 China is larger than ever before." The
j Star quoted no statistics, but rested its
i statement upon a statement published at
; the time, to the effect that the boycott
! had been greatly exaggerated in the intert
est of an increased coolie traffic to Araer,
ica, and that general trade between China
and America was not only good, but better
than ever before.
, Mr John Focrd, secretary of the American
Asiatic Society, combats the claim
as to the size of our trade with China, and
gives in a communication to The Star figures
showing that our sales to Chlni were
not as large for the fiscal year of ltHX? as
for that of 1905, and that they are likewise
unpromising as far as reported since.
The question at issue is, except as to
the American Asiatic Association, very far
above trade. Trade, of course, we all desire,
but not at the expense of the Chinese
exclusion law. The Star's position has
been from the first, and is now, that all
the trade of the whole four hundred millions
of the Chinese people would be appallingly
expensive in exchange for the
free admission into this country of Chinese
coolies, or even for a tinkering with the
exclusion law having that effect. There is
no place here for the coolies, nor one to be
made even by men who have set their
hear.; cn capturing Asiatic business by
catering to Asiatics at the expense of the
higher American interests. The man who
is so eager to sell goods to the Chinese
that he is willing to make our immigration
laws lax in their behalf is not the proper
man to shape those laws.
While the subject was under discussion
[ at the la-st session, somebody, speaking at
t a trade banquet, described our course to
ward the Chinese as "infamous." Mr. Foord
; is a trifle milder, but still pointed, when
: j he asks for "decent treatment" for China;
men. But the campaign at this session is
r young yet. and maybe before February is
r far advanced the stronger word will again
r be employed. The country's iolicy has been
i S adopted by Congress, and several times in>
j dorsed. in obedience to popular sentiment
r expressed through the regular channels,
and maybe those who want to change it
might find a better way to proceed than by
j setting up as the monopolists of decency
t in interpreting our duty to the Chinese. We '
sliall not sell any more goods to China, or
elsewhere, by bowing our heads to the clubbings
ot drummers inspired by their samp'.e
cases.
Perhaps it is an appreciation of the gravity
of the crisis in France that restrains
American statesmanship from expressions
of any kind on the subject.
r Mr. Root's suggestions as to the effaceI
ment of state lines will effectually alienate
i any southern sympathy that the unfriendly
demonstrations of colored orators may have
won the administration
The mikado is willing to be patient, but
dcej not hesitate to indicate that he would
consider it a nersonal favor if this country
would revise its form of government.
Mr. Bryan is doubtless wondering whether
some of the topics the administration is
now discussing are not quite as dangerous
as government ownership.
Diplomatic circles are now convinced that
there are more dangerous pnstimes for society
women than bridge whist.
It is rather disappointing to have people
come back from the arctic regions and talk
of the beastly climate hereabouts.
Both Raisouli and the Sultan of Morocco
are so friendly to American citizens that it
is a little difficult to take sides.
The Dictograph.
It is said that the dictograph will make
speeches, delivered in either house o^ Congress.
audible in the most remote committee
room. Many persons favor such a device,
but they probably know little of the
character of congressional orations. Of
f course, the dictograph has friends; there
mr ujiuu-u UU UI1just
cause, for as some persons ins'st on
combatting what is right, others insist on
favoring what is wrong. There are persona
. who would get lost if they should find
themselves on the right side of any proposition.
Some of these have been elected to
Congress.
The dictograph Is no doubt a clever device.
but Its use at the Capitol would not
give unalloyed satisfaction. In the first
place there are speakers on the lloor of
the House who are audible In the committee
rooms without dlctographic aid. To increase
the number of these speakers would
be a shame. There is really no use in extending
the baleful Influence of House oratory
until it shall Involve even the comniit,
tee rooms.
Some persons believe that Congressmen
are so strongly Interested in legislation
ina: iney wouia nice to near au mat goes
on In Congress. These persons are very
young. Why, members of the House and
Senate, sitting in their chambers, do not
!isten to speeches. Speeches sometimes tn
terfere with private conversation?bnt let
often.
There is a humorous belief in simple
hearts that one- Congressman is interested
in another Congressman's speech. This is
rot always the case, because he knows that
he can make a better speech himself. And
if he can make any kind of a speech, he
is probably right.
Shall the dulet of some committee rooms
be disturbed by the howls and growls of a
new member who thinks he is saying something?
Shall the conviviality of other committee
rooms be disturbed by these raucous
sounds? If the committee rooms are to be i
broken in upon in this cruel way where are 1
members to take their na.p? and nips? i
Speeches are not made in Congress tor
Congressmen, but for constituents. If a
device could be procured which would reader
Congressional speeches inaudible anywhere.
there would be an immediate demand
for it.
After while some evil genius is coming
along with a machine which will m.;ke
visible on the tioor of the House and Senate
all that goes on in the committee
rooms. Then will the legislative branch of
the government produce' its full si:, .e of
sensations.
Spelling reform may fail, but its promoters
will have the satisfaction of knowing
that it is one of the reforms over whose
defeat rvo trust can congratulate itself.
Mr. Bryan wilt unhesitatingly admit that
the eflfacement of state lines is not one of
the ideas tliat the administration borrowed
from him.
The tariff is always sure of a liberal
measure of attention in Congress, whether :
the President discusses it in his message
or not.
The shirt sleeve diplomacy that lias sometimes
troubled Kurope seems preferable to
the evening gown variety.
Mr. Smoot has lone since failed to find
any striking novelty in the senatorial scoldings
to which he is constantly subject.
SHOOTING STABS.
A Discouraged Beformer.
"I was rtever very hopeful about spelling
reform," remarked the cheerless person.
"Yet you advocated it!"
"Yes. But I knew it was a forlorn hope.
The reforms most likely to succeed are
those that make official vacancies which
the reformers can fill."
A Diplomat.
"Does Bliggins keep telling hard-luck
stories because he wants ympathy?"
"No. He mereiy wants to discourage people
who might want to borrow from him."
Not to Be Desired.
If all the Christmas tales were true,
This life would be a railure, 'cause
A lot of us woulu r ever do
A thing but wait for Uanta Claus.
One Advantage.
"So you think an automobile would be the
bes. thing for an explorer to use in trying
for the north pole."
"Yes." answered .he man who is afraid
of his motor car; "the man who uses an
automobile has at the very outset a good
excuse for not reaching his destination."
Selection.
"A politician shouiJ be able to select as
his friends those who can do him the most
good "
"Yes." answered Ijenator Sorghum, "and
it is equally important to select as your
enemies tho. who can do you the least
harm."
. The Era of Suspicion.
Jenkins has bought him a four-story houseMust
be a little bit shifty.
Once was so poor the proverbial mouse
Seemed, by comparison, thrifty;
Jones lu-s some stock in a railway that pays,
His family's all in high feather,
And Brown's great big salary's just had a
raiseLet's
call the grand jury together.
To my poverty now I am pointing with
pride
As I see how the millionaires tumble.
With stealthy detectives on every side
Who bid them take heed and dissemble.
It they're founding a college or running a
race
For office, there's questioning whether
They can honestly come into fame or high
place,
And they call the grand jury together.
Tellawoman.
From the Springfield I'uion.
The end man's joke that there are three
ways of communication?telegraph, telephone
and tellawoman?has almost the significance
of a truism in view of the correspondence
that passed between the President
and the Storers. While upholding the
President in his action in dismissing Mr.
Storer from the diplomatic service, we must
admit that it was very indiscreet for him to
write so fully and "confidentially" about
state secrets to "My dear Maria." With all
of our admiration for Mr. Roosevelt we

Asking Too Much.
Kroui the Minneapolis Tribune.
The President asks from Congress, not
only seriously but with great- earnestness,
the power to dismiss officers of the navy
by executive order without process of law.
It would be a great misfortune to remove
or relax any of the safeguards that protect
American soldiers and sailors from
ruin of their career by an arbitrary act.
These officers are net political driftwood,
tossed into place by one election and
washed out by another. They haye trained
themselves for a life career and are entit

permanence.
Champion of Petcc.
From the Now York Snn.
Long after the little campaign in which
Theodore Roosevelt received his baptism
of fire is recalled only by consulting
a reference book be will be acclaimed
the champion of peace whose labors were
recognized by the gift of the illustr-.ous
Nobel prize, and if his name does not
lead all the rest it will be very near the
top. Medals of honor for making war
are common enough, but tokens of distinction
for stopping war and spreading
the doctrine of peace among all the nations
are the portion only of the eiact
and the deathless.
State Bights.
From (he New York World.
It is a significant fact that the gentlemen
who profess to find a great democratic Issue
in Elihu Root's speech at the dinner of the
Pennsylvania Society are for the most part
either Wall street financiers, corporation
lawyers or anti-Roosevelt republicans.
Pay Fine by Proxy.
From the New Orleans Times-Democrat.
John D. Rockefeller will be arraigned
before the Ohio courts by proxy, his attorney
entering the plea for him. Ir is
just possible that in the event he la flrwyl
by the court he will designate the public
as proxy to pay the fine.
To Prevent Begret.
From the Hartford Tliuea.
A man rarely lias reason to reeret the
things he doesn't say or the letters he
doesn't write.
Radical Proposal.
From the Knoxville Sentinel.
Let us do away with ftreworks during the
Christmas holidays so far as Knoxville is
concerned.
