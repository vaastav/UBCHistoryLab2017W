Londen, Dec 10. Turkey ia te be
coercod. The aultan ia te be reduced,
in fact-, if net actually in name, te vas
salage Ills fate will be made known
te him probably bofero the end of the
present week.
Russia, France and Great Britain las
decrecd it. Should he resist or fall te
bow at ence te the inevltable, then the
combined fleets of theso thrce powers
will onferco thelr behest
uch, in brief, is the infinitely wol wel wol
cemo news which will bring relief and
a sonse of restored aelf-respcct te the
whole Christian world. It is net offi
cially announced yet. It may even be
discredited in certain quarters for a
few hours as premature. Hut it can
be affirmed, nevertheless, without res
ervation. It was net until Tuesday that the
full consummation was reached. Rus
sia, France and Great Ilrltain arrived
at a substantial agreement en a 'plan
of action last week. There remained
the necessity of getting the consent of
the ether three powers which were
signatories of the Berlin convention,
Italy and Germany agreed without
much demur. Austria hesitated long,
and it was net until after Tuesday's
emergency cabinet council in Londen,
which discussed and approved the
whole plan, that the Austrian ambas
sader notified Lord Salisbury of tne
rather unwilling assent of the govern
ment that the Russian, French and
British fleets shall force the Darda
nelles, if necessary, in the execution of
the new policy.
The selutidn of the Turkish problem
provides nothing se radical as a divis
ion of the Turkish empire. Such a
project has, net been for a moment
considered. The integrity of Turkey
will be substantially maintained.
The terms of the new policy have
practically been dictated by Russia.
There are two or thrce versions in
diplomatic cirvlcs of the policy at last
decided upon. This is one:
That Russia shall occupy the north
eastern corner formed by the Bos Bes Bos
eorus and the Black sea and extend
ing te a point about half way down
the Bosperus; that Constantinople and
the Dardanelles shall be placed under
European protection, but shall remain
under the rule of ( the sulten, the forts
at the Dardanelles being dismantled
and the passage becoming entirely
free. Ne further change is suggested
in regard te the integrity of the Turk
ish empire.
This includes also European super
vision of some of the sultan's appoint
ments. SPANISH CABINET
Holds a Meetlnc for the Cnimhtnriitlen of
I'renlilent Cluvelanrt's Mcmimte.
Madrid, Dec 10. The Heraldo says:
The cabinet held a meeting Wednesday
for the purpose of considering Presi
dent Cleveland's message te congress.
Ex-Premier Sagasta declared that the
message is of se much importance that
he will wait the receipt of the full text
of the document before discussing it.
Seme of the Spanish newspapers de
clare that the message provokes Eu
rope, net Spain alone.
The general opinion here is that the
references te Cuba and Spain contained
in President Cleveland's message te
congress show that it is the intention
of the United States te conform mere
and mere te the Menree doctrine every
time a case arises te which that princi
ple is applicable.
The cabinet, after debating the text
of the message Wednesday, will form
some definite judgment, which it is be
lieved will result in 'a modification of
the relations of Spain with the United
States.
The Ileralde says that the presi
dent's message foreshadows the inter
vention of the United States in Cuba in
March next, but adds that Spain will
repel the arregance of the American
government.

drowning in a large tank used
for waterlng stock, which oc
curred near Plymouth en Sunday last,

Detectives are new at work en the case

' Bpensibe for the deed first murdered
the old lady and then held her aged
husband under the water in the tank
until life was extinct in order te make
it appear a case of murder and suicide,
and thus cever up their crime.
