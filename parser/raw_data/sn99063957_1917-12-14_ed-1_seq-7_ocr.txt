American invention that is the pic
is the invention. Tho sum of $23 was
realized which is to be appropriated
on paying for the school piano. This
piano was not purchased bv the school
board but by donations by individuals
of the district and quito an amount of
the purchase money has already been
secured. W. F. Kaplinger auctioned off
the pies and it is enough to make one 's
month water to hear him do it. The
highest price paid for any one pio was
$1.25 and it 'was probably worth it if
it was a mince, when we consider the
old gray nightmare which is always
givon gratis. The next meeting of the
literary will be Friday evening the
22d the anniversary of the Pilgrim
fathers' landing. There will be a full
program. A good crowd is expected.
Now tht the British have driven the
"unspeakable Turk" from tho "holy
city" the next move should be to fire
the licencious and barbarous- sultan
from Constantinople or drop him in the
Bosphorus. With the Turk eliminated
from Euroipe and Asia and kaiserism
wiped off the earth this world would
bo vastly, improved and on tho high
way to peace and to' happy destiny. So
mote it be.
The Hans were H Turanian raco
from Asia. They were short, thick set,
with flat noses, deep sunk eves, and a
yellow complexion. Their faces wero
hidoously scarred with slashes to pre
vent the growth of the beard. A histor
ian of the time compared them in
their ugliness to the grinning heads
clumsily carved on the posts of bridges.
They built no cities or houses, and
never came under a roof except in su
perstitions dread, mey were clad in
skins, which they never changed until
they rotted off. They lived on horse
back, carrying their families and all
their possessions in linge wagons
Barnes' Gen. Hist., p. 265.
The modern Hungarians are descend
ed from the Magyars. The historian
tells us they "were a barbarous people
occupying the plains of modern Hun
gary. More cruel than even the Norse
man, they were believed to bo canni
bals, and to drink the blond of their
enemies." Barnes, p. 374. About the
year 1000 they settled down peaceably
on the lands once occupied by tho
Huns and became known by the name
Hungarians.

WILD OVER ATHLETICS
,MeL Sheppard, Famous Dis
tance Runner, Tells About
Great Interest Shown
B. H. C. Hamilton
(United l'rcss Staff Correspondent)
New York, Doc. 13. "The thirty-
eighth division is wild about athletics'
Tliat 's tho way Mel. W. Sheppard, fa
mous as a distance runner in the days
before he went over to Uncle Sam's
forces, feels about it, aud he stated it
enthusiastically to Tho United I'ress
when asked the extent of athletics in
Camp Blielby, Tattiesburg, Miss, bliep
pard is divisional athletic director for
Camp Bhelby, and is spreading his bit
by serving on three committees.
-Football, baseball, boxing, field and
track competition they all have their
part in the scheme of making the for
mer national guardsmen of West Vir
ginia, Indiana and Kentucky fit for
the long hike to Berlin.
"Why wo had 10,U00 spectators at
ono football game," Sheppard enthus
ed. "We sent our team against the
Richmond Blues of Richmond, Va., a
short time ago, aud it was one of tho
best football games I ever saw. The
score was a tie, 6 to 6.
"We played Mississippi college and it
was a slaughter. Our boys simply licked
tliem to death, winning 45 to 0. The
football team has been the center of at
traction. .
"We're going to have lots of fun out
of athletics hero, aud perhaps after we
get 'over there.'
"The executive council endorsed a
cross-country run for Thanksgiving day
and you should have seen the competi
tion. A divisional field meet is held
every Wednesday: Regiments hold cham
pionships every Sunday.
"We have competitions of all sorts,
ilividcd into all branches. . Recreative
athletics is our idea,. with proper regard
to the physical and mental condition
of the individual.
" We have organized a divisional ath
letic council, whose purpose shall bo t
promote recreative athletics."
Camp Shelby has something of a
sports staff, too, to chronicle its ath
letics. Stewart Jackson, well know sport
writer, is encamped there as a lieuten
ant in the Indiana infantry.
