IInigal on
witness stand
Relates How He Aided in Dy
namiting Many Large
Buildings.
Los Angeles. Dec S. Ortie. Mo
Manlgal began today on the witness
stand in the Schmidt trial the long
deferred narration of his part in tue
dynamite plot, a story that -would,
have been told by him five years ago
in the McNamara trial except for tiio
Interposition of the plea of guilty oy
tho McNamaras. McManigal made
such progress with his story today
that District Attorney Woolwine ex
pects to finish the direct examination
tomorrow, through he had expected
to have McManigal under interroga
tion for at least five days.
Numerous references by McManigal
to the precence of his wife at meet
ings between himself and Herbert S.
Hockln and himself and J. B. McNa
mara suggested that Mrs. McManigal
would be called as a witness for the
Begins With First Job.
Beginning with his first "Job" of
dvnamiting, in Detroit In 1907, Mc
manigal testified to dynamiting after
dynamiting down to June 20, 1010,
when he and J. B. McNamara blew
up a pile of building material in Cleve
land. Throughout the day the court
room was crowded and tho eager spec
tators hung on the words of the star
dynamiter.
McManigal was cool and spoke clear
ly and was seldom at loss even for a
moment for a date or details of an in
cident. What few slips he made he
corrected himself. His manner was
modost, and yet ho told of dynamit
Ings as if they might have been mere
snowballings of dignified old gentle
men. His greatest show of feelings
was when he talked of tho manner In
which Herbert S Hockln "double
crossed" him in the matter of pay.
despoiling him in that way of a total
of $525 of his hard-earned wages as
an honest dynamiter.
Attitude of Defense.
Senator Coghlan, Job Harnman,
Edwin V. McKensie and Fred Moore,
the attorneys for the defense, have
chosen to treat McManigal's testimony
with levity, since In all its main fea
tures, reinforced by hotel registers,
records of dynamltings and other tes
timony, it iB unassailable. They claim
that its remoteness from connection
with tie defendant Schmidt robs It
of Importance and it is expected that
Senator Coghlan's cross-examination
will be comparatively brief, but
chockful of sarcasm.
Schmidt was tense throughout the
day, and stared at McManigal with
manifest hate.
Tho great moments of McManigal's
story were those in which he told of
meetings and conversations with J. B.
McNamara, whom Schmidt is accused
Df helping to get the high explosive
with which he blew up the Los An
geles newspaper plant on October 1,
1910, and killed Charles Haggerty and
nineteen others.
Alter these came in importance' his
accounts of meetings with J. J. McNa
mara, tho arch-plotter who sent his
brother to the California job.
McManigal told of his first meeting
with J. B. McNamara, In the lobby of
the Braun hotel in Munlce, Ind., De
cember 9, 1909. He was introduced
as Miller and McNamara aB Brlce. Mc
Manigal identified on the hotel regis
ter McNamara's registration as "J. B.
Brico," his own as "Charles Miller,"
and Hockln as "Charles Clark."
"That night In my room," said Mc
Manigal, "J. B. McNamara described
his invention to me. He demonstrat
ed it, using a lead pencil to represent
the dry battery 2nd his .watch to rep
resent the alarm clock."
Job in Salt Lake.
At a meeting of himself, J. B. Mc
Namara and Hockln in McManigal's
flat in Chicago about April 2S 1910,
he said McNamara told him he was
the man who dynamited the Hotel
Utah in Salt Lake City a few days be
fore. "He told me the explosion near
ly knocked Brlgham Young off his
monument," testified McManigal.
On June 17, the witness testified,
he and J. B. went to Cincinnati to
meet Hockln, in response to a tele
gram, and Hockln arranged for them
to work together. He sent them on
way of IndiaL --polls to get nitrogly
cerine an Infernal machines. McMan
igal said that "J. J." turned over to
them three four-auart cans of nit.
glycerine that he had packed utf In
his office, and three or four of the
clocks.

ANCONA NOTE IS
SENT TO VIENNA
Washington, Dec. 8. The United
States has sent to Austria-Hungary a
note asking for a disavowal of the
submarine attack upon tho Italian
liner Ancona, assurances that such
an act will not be repeated, somo de
gree of punishment for the command
or of tho submarine and reparation
for tho American lives loBt.
The communication started by
cable yesterday from the state de
partment to Ambassador Frederic C.
Penfiold at Vienna, who was Instruct
ed to hand it to tho Austro-Hungarlon
minister of foreign affairs. Baron Bur
1 ian. Word of the delivery of tho note
had not been received by tho depart
ment tonight.
Friendly but firm torms, it is said,
characterize the document, which is
understood to make a particular point
of prompt assurances for the future
safety of American lives.
Asks Explanation.
Austria-Hungary has never in
formed the United States whether the
commanders of its submarines had
been given instructions similar to
those which the Gorman government
gavo to Its commanders after the
Lusitania tragedy. It Is understood
that the note referred particularly to
tho charge that shells from the sub
marine killed or wounded some pas
sengers on the Ancona after she had
halted, and asked for an explanation
on that point
In dispatching the note Secretary
Lansing acted with tho approval of
President Wilson. It 1b stated authori
tatively that the document, which Is
described as being comparatively
brief and decidedly vigorous In tone,
was so drafted as to attempt a settle
ment of the controversy at once, with
out bringing on a series of communi
cations, such as followed the sinking
of the Lusitania.
High officials are said to be of the
opinion that the situation Is one
which calls for grave consideration,
the state of affairs having become
more complicated since the note was
dispatched by reports of attacks on
American oil-carrying vessels In the
Mediterranean, presumably by Aus
trian submarines.
Officials Surprised.
N-ews that the note had been sent
came as a complete surprise to offi
cial Washington Generally, the reports
which emanated from the state de
partment early In the week 'being that
no positive and corroborated evidence
as to what actually had occurred when
tho Ancona wont down had been re
ceived. It was said that tho reports
teceived were fragmentary, conflict
ing or contradictory and that until a
reply to the Inquiries submitted to
Austria-Hungary was received, it was
probable that no communication
would be sent to Vienna
Tonight it was suggested in some
quarters that Information of a most
conclusive nature had come to secre
tary Lansing probably late Monday
night and that It had been decided
then that the protest should go for
ward immediately. Whether Am
bassador Penfleld had transmitted
the reply of tho Vienna foreign office
to tho list of queries submitted by
the United States could not be as
certained. '
Full Details Requested.
The belief prevails, however, that
the state department had received
answers of some sort to the queries.
In the inquiry Austria-Hungary was
asked, among other things, whether a
warning shot had been fired before
tho ship was shelled, whether time
was given the passengers to get to a
place of safety and whether any shots
were fired at the ship after she had
stopped.

ALLIES DO NOT
REALIZE DEFEAT
Berlin, Dec. 8, by wireless to Say
vllle. In an address before a conven
tion of tho Progressive People's par
ty, the president, Friederich von
Rayre, member of the Reichstag, rais
ed the question whether Germany "be
ing the stronger and having won the
victory, ought to hold out her hand
for peace." Herr von Payre replied
to his own question by asserting that
this would not be possible only when
the enemies of Germany realized that
they had been defeated as they had
not thus far.
The world did not understand this,
he continued, believing the German
military, or annexationist party, was
opposed to peace at the present time,
desiring to carry on the war .to a fur
ther stage.

COMMUNIPAW
IS TORPEDOED
Rome, Dec. 9, 12:58 p. ra. The
Giornale d'ltalla says the Egyptian
authorities confirm the torpedoing of
tho American steamer Communipaw
and says' that tho submarine which
sent hp.r to tie bottom was a German
of a large type.
The first report of the torpedoing
of the American tank steamer Com
munipaw, says tho Gironall d'ltalla,
was a radio message from an Italian
steamer, which had picked up a wire
less call for help from the Communi
paw and proceeded to her assistance,
at tho same time sending on the wire
less message to an Italian steamer,
a Great torpedo boat destroyer and a
British warship. None of them,
however, was able to find any trace
of the American steamer crew.

AHACHES WERE
KAISER'S OWN
Washington, Dec. 8. Emperor Will
lam has a personal Interest In the
withdrawal of Captain Karl Boy-ed
and Captain Franz von Papen, attach
es of the German embassy hero.
State department officials have
been informed that as the attaches
were personally appointed by Emper
or William, he personally will prob
ably give the orders for their with
drawal. It is understood that officials con
sidered it probable that the Berlin
foreign office was prompted to ask
what caused the action of the Uni
ted States in declaring the attaches
persona non grata so that when a
report of the Incident Is made to the
emperor it may bo complete In all
details.
The belief prevailed in official cir
cles that Ambassador Bernstorff
would not be able to inform Secre
tary Lansing that tho wishes of the
United' States would be complied
with before Saturday at the earliest

GERMANS ARETO
LEAVE THE U. S. '
Consul Franz Bopp Says He
Does Not Like This i
Country.
San Francisco, Dec. S. Franz Bopp,
consul general of Germany In San
Francisco, today arraigned tho Amer
ican public for what ho terms its un
fair treatment of his countrymen.
Coincldentally, Herman D. Lempko,
attorney for the kaiser's consulate,
issued a lengthy statement flaying
United States District Attorney John
W. Preston, intimating that Collec
tor of the Port J. O. Davis had vio
lated tho laws of neutrality and set
ting forth in detail heretofore unpub
lished accounts of the activities of
Charles C. Crowley as a German
agent, j
Consul Bopp's utterances were
called forth by rumors that Indict
ments of himself and members of his
official family or demands for his re
call might be an outcome of the gov
ernment's investigation of nation-wide
bomb conspiracies.
The light of battle glittered in his
blue eyes as the consul general of
Germany exclaimed:
"I do not like tills country any j
more and will be happy to return to .
Germany. I am disgusted with the '
feoling shown toward me. And 1
am not the only one! After the war
there will take place a regular exo
dus of Gorman-Americans who feel
about things in the United States as
I do. Many German-Americans are
not even waiting for the end of the
war, but are right now renouncing
their American citizenship and return'
ing to Germany."
"What Is your opinion of President
Wilson's message, with special refer
ence to naturalized plotters against
American peace and neutrality?"
Bopp was asked.
"I cannot speak as I would like to,"
said Bopp. "But what I think is dif
ferent. But I am under the impres
sion that the president must have
referred to people in the United
States who are friendly to the Ger
mans. To my mind, however, there
are many so-called neutrals in the
United States who are pro-British
So T really must suppose the president
includes them, too."
Lempke's statement alleges among
other things that last fall, when twen
ty submarines were being built for
the allies at Union Iron Works at
San" Francisco, It was evidence fur
nished by Crowley which give the first
impetus for an examination of the
matter by the United States govern
ment. Crowley later showed up the smug
gling of parts of these submarines in
to Canada for completion there.

GERMANS TO MOVE

London, Dec. 9, 3:31 a. m. A dis

"According to Indirect news from
Constantinople, Germany has aban

against Egypt in favor of a great
Turco- German expedition against In

rapidly. Tho Germans and Bulgar

Greek border, ten miles south of Mon

Anglo-French forces, while Bulgars,

CALLES DEFEATED
BY VILLA FORCES
El Paso, Dec. S. General Villa, with
2000 men, reached Madera, Chihua
hua, on the Mexican nortnwestern rail
road, late today, according to authen
tlv advices. It is expected General
Rodriguez will now move rapidly east
ward to Casas Grandes, rejoining Vil
la at Madera.
Douglas,- Ariz., Dec. 8. After a
sharp engagement General Joso Rodri
guez and his Villa army occupied
Fronteras, south of Agua Prleta, to
day, driving southward Carranza for
ces under General P. Ellas Calles.
Rodriguez burned several bridges be
tween Esqueda and Fronteras, thus
soverlng Calles' railroad communica
tion with Agua Prieta, opposite here.
Rodrlquez also cut telegraph and
telephone wires upon entering Fron
teras. Calles, however, managed be
fore retreating southward to send
word to Agua Prleta for help. Seven
hundred men, under General Angel
Flores, were dispatched this afternoon
to his aid.
Controls Railroad.
The capture of Fronteras places
Rodriguez again between two .Carran
za lorces and gives him control of
the railroad running between Agua
Pneta and Nacbzarl. The garrison
at Agua Prieta once omre was placed
In readiness for attack.
Five Americans reached here today
from Fronteras, but J. W. Cunning
ham of Tulsa, Okla,, and H. G. South
erd of Douglas, two men previously
threatened by Villa troops, were not
among them, and fears were again felt
for their safety.
Information that Villa, with a small
force, had appeared at Batuc came
from reliable sources, but could not
be confirmed.
Onsnrfihin Established.
Special trains carrying 1000 Car
ranza troops left Agua Prieta today
to reinforce the soldiers at Fronteras.
They were preceded by General Al
varo Obregon. It was said that 1500
other troops were being sent north
ward from Esqueda to attempt an
outflanking movement
The Carranza authorities at Agua
Prieta established a strict censorship
late today. General Francisco Villa
appeared suddenly yesterday at Batuc,
a town north of Tonlchl, where Gen
eral Francisco Urbalejo, his Yaqul
leader, surrendered, messages from
Cananea, Sonora, stated today. Villa
killed one steer to feed his small
command and then hastily departed
with Carranza forces from the south
in close pursuit, it was said.
CABINET CONFERS
ON FOREIGN PLOTS
"Washington, Dec. 8. Methods of
enforcing American neutrality, legis
lation necessary to insure the punish
ment of all who plot against Ameri
can industries or Institutions through
international motives and the Boy-ed,
von Papen and von Nuber cases were
considered at an extraordinary con
ference of administration officials to
day. Secretary of State Lansing,
Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo,
Secretary of War Garrison, Attorney
General Gregory and Postmaster Gen
eral Burleson were present. Coun'
sellor Frank Polk of the state depart,
raent was called in several times In
the course of the discussion. The
only announcement made was thar
the conferenco discussed "domestic
affairs which have a bearing on in
ternational matters."
Coming on tho heels of President
Wilson's scathing arraignment of the
"creatures of passion, disloyalty and
anarchy" who have plotted against
neutrality, and his demand for ade
quate legislation to crush them out '
Id His message to congress, the con-1
ference had peculiar significance.
Situation Gone Over.
It was generally accepted as the
beginning of a vigorous, aggressive
campaign by the administration
against the class of Americans de
nounced by the president. One of
the immediate results of the confer
ences is expected to be the drafting
of the "adequate federal laws" on neu
trality demanded by the president
The conference, it was understood,
canvassed the whole neutrality situa
tion, Just now a serious problem, be
cause of the delicate German situa
tion growing out of the demand for
the recall of Captains von Papen and
Boy-ed. and because of the numerous
