matter of fact the injunction procure
by Mr. Poppleton has in no way expo
dited municipal ownership of thu water
works. Although the contention of M
Poppleton has been that the city had
tight to acquire the works by purchase
under the arbitration clause of the
water works ordinance, in tho year 1001
no steps have been taken In that dire
tlon, and Mr. Poppleton himself, If w
are correctly Informed, does not favor
such acquisition under the arbitration
clause, because tlio city woirid be bound
to abide by the appraisement mado by
two of the three arbitrators, even If that
appraisement should be double or treble
thu actual value of the water works

dinance aro that the city shall appoint
ono of the appraisers, tho water works

by a majority of thu three shall be ab

persuade the third member of this arbi

sentative on the arbitration board was

to pay for tho works several millions
more than tho amount for which they
could be duplicated.

tho only drawback to such a process is
tltat thu city would havo to pay thu es

Poppleton claims to be lu 100(1 and tho
