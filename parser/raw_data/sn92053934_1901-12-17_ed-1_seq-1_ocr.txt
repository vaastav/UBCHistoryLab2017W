duced a resolution to investigate
conduct of Schley from the time he
took command of the Hying squadron
up to and including the destruction
of the Spanish fleet.
It recites the action of the court

the verdict of the court of Inquiry in
the cape of Rear Admiral Schley wan
IiC'.irtl In the senate yesterday when
Jones of Arkansas introduced n reso
lution extending the thanks of ron
fres and of the American people to
Admiral Schley and the othcers and
men . under his command during . lb
battle of July IV.tS. oft the harbor of
Santiago. Cuba. In submitting the
J evolution j ones made no statement,
end it was reierred witbont comment
to the committee on naval affair.
But a still more imiortant echo was
developed in crespondence that took
j.Ia'-e yesterday lietween Lawyer Itay
l'er and Secretary Long. Admiral
Schley was in consultation all forenoon
with his counsel. Rayner. and M. A.
Teajrue. also General Felix Agnus, of
Baltimore, and Representative Scbirni,
of Maryland. After the conference
Schley authorized Teague to make the
following statement:
"We have been in consultation as
to what further proceedings shall lw
t::ken. Nothing definite hns Iteeii de
termined uion so tar as civil or crim
inal act ion of any kind against Mn
Hay a fid his jsjKJiisors is concerned.
Maclay's claim that the findings of the
court are a vindication for himself and
his look Is absolutely spurious. There
ore no less than half n dozen instances
in the look In which, even if he were
to accept the findings of the court and
ii:cononite them In the volume and
change It to suit the Hidings, the book
would still le criminal liliel."
The correspondence consisted of a
letter to Secretary Ixng requesting
him to delay affixing his approval to
the findings until SchISy had an oppor
tunity to tile his objections to the find
ings, and that the court be not dis
solved until the requested action has
been had. Secretary Ixng granted the
request anil asked how long counsel
would le preparing the objections.
Tl reply was that they would be
ready Thursday or rriday of this
wee. The purpose is to demand that
the majority opinion le disapproved by
the secretary as contrary to the evi
dence. The secretary allowed until
Friday imt In which to submit the
executions.
When the World Will Be Fall.
If we apply to the future growth of
the world's populatiou the rate of in

As there are 52,000,fM0 square miles
of laud on the earth, and as we are to
consider 1.00O persons to each square
mile as the equivalent of the world's
being full. It follows that we want a
world populatiou of 52,000,000,000 of
persons to fulfill this condition.
A glance at the above statement of
growth In the world's population shows
that the necessary growth from 1.C00,
000,000 In the year 1000 to the 52,000,
000,000 of persons wanted for our pur
pose will eventuate in the year 2250, al

the coffin. Unally Atheno woke fron
his trance slowly, color returned to his
cheeks, the body grew warm, and tbw
sleeper stirred and sat up. Instantly
his wife caught him by the ear. 1I?
looked at her a moment and then lay
pack In hts comn and returned to
slumler that Is an exact simulation of
death. Two physicians were sent for,
md they finally resuscitated him
when he was arrested on his wife's
charge.

A Sinclair Earthworm.
We have heard of a good many, crea
tures which sing, including Mr. Itus
kin's singing serpents in the valley of
Diamonds, yet Mr. Anuandale has as
sured us that there exists in the Malay
peninsula a being which the Malays de
scribed under the above heading.
It lives in a burrow- ia the ground
and cheerfully sings, or at least chirps.
But the Malays call everything that
creeps a worm, and the beast which
they really mean is a large kind of
cricket with a voice.
Iu the very same part of the world,
however, is a real earthworm, a huge
monster three or four feet iu length,
which was discovered not long ago and
which really has a voice, or at least
can produce a sound. The Latin name
of musicus has been given to it on that
account.
When it is foraging about near the
surface of the ground, the numerous
sharp little bristles implanted in its
skin, which euable it to hold on to the
earth, strike against stones and give
out a musical sound. This is rather
more like twanging a "Jew's harp"
than singing. But any sort of sound
from these silent, gliding creatures is
singing. London Express.
JarLion and the TaJlor'a Bill.
A gentleman In Pennsylvania has a
queer document which came into his
family's possession . many years ago
and shows an interesting phase of An
drew Jackson's character as well as a
glimpse of the 6imple times pf his pres
idential term.
It appears that & clerk in the state
department contracted a tailor's bill for
$G4.50. and the tailor, finding himself
unable vto collect the amouut, laid the
matter before the president in an ap
pealing letter.
Jackson promptly decided that this
was a matter to which he must attend
personally, so he transmitted the tai
lor's letter to the secretary of state,
with this strong recommendation:
Btferreil to the secretary of sUte. If on inquiry
the fact stated be true, unless the clerk pays up
bis debt let him be forthwith discharged.
The government would become a party to such
swindling: provided it permitted its officers to be
come indebted for necessaries and not see that
they paid their debts out ot their salaries.
Honest men will pay their debts. Dishonest
men mutt not be employed by the government.
