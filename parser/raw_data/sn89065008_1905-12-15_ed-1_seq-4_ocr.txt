Pace of the Time«.
When the "times" were leas swift
footed, «ay a century ago, to keep up
with them was doubtless a umimcnd*
able thing to do, and not so difficult
a.i it is now, for in those happy days
life was not no complex. One might
easily have k*'pt abreast of the times
then, and studied them In leisurely
comfort, to the Improvement of his
mind and soul. Ho had no trains or
fcdegraphfl to burden his thought, with
unrelated facta, and had the leisure to
absorb and digest such events, inci
dents and episodes us he came in
contact with. But the times are now
swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and
gorged with unwholesome events, de
clares the 8L Ixjuis Globe-Democrat.
They ravo and shriek in maddening
staccato as they pursue their headlong
career. They are intoxicated with
sensation and maudlin with inooher
eut, heterogeneous facts. The Urnes
are had company, and menace the
inoral and intellectual welfare of
whoso endeavors to keep pace with ;
them. The unfortunate person who
seeks to keep up with the present
times can do little rise. He Uvea in
a frenzy, and his mental digestion is
ruined. His mind is a catalogue of
wars, distress, elections, horse shows,
inti ho does
not know what any of these things
mean. He has no time for reasoning
or thought of any kind. Ills memory
is overworked, but his cogitive fac
ulties are atrophied from disuse. He
loses the relation betwixt himself and
events. Ho knows the "what" and
the "when," but not the bow" ami
the "why." Ho has no power to an
alyze or compare. Ask him what ho
knows, and ho will give you ft list of
words, whereof he knows not what one
means. He has lost the better part
of his mind. He is keeping "up with
the times." All of which generalize

to pick It off. Carefully raising her

lhat the United States hereafter take
steps to distribute immigrants accord
ing to the needs of the country.
I have Just received a few figures,"
he said, "showing where this immigra

Six states of the union received 777,748
or 76 per cent, of the whole, which
gives th8 gentlemen from these states
some idea of how popular those states
are abroad and how rapidly they gained
last year."
Mr. Sargent recommended that in

Conteat Over Convict Contract

claiming that the board of control D
no authority under the law to lease an»
place or work any convicts on any but
the State's lands. Commissioner McNair
voted with the governor, but Attorney
General Williams and Commissioner.
Bradley and Xmcannon voted forth«
lease. The writ of injunction was is.
sued by Chief Justice Whitfield, but it
was not served until after the majority
members and Senator McLaurin had
signed up tie papers. A fight iu th«
courts will follow.
There are about 1,000 acres in the
bandy Bayou plantation, and it takes 75
or 80 convicts to work it.

The biggest and strongest land com
P.any in the State is in course of forma,
tion in Jackson, anti will be organized
and begin active business the 1st ol
January. The company is to be formed
by home and Eastern capital, of which
there will be an unlimited supply, so
that the very largest tracts of pine and
delta lands may be bought for cash and
sold on time payments. The company
has already purchased 340,000 acres ol
pine and hardwood timber lands, and
by the first of the year will be ready
for the biggest business in that line in
the State.
There were 1,123 names on the State's
prison rolls on Nov. 30, a gain of thir
teen over the month previous. During
the month of November twenty-live
were discharged; there was one death,
two pardons and two escapes. A death
rate of one for more than 1,000 speaks
well for the management of the Missis
sippi convict farms, and it is doubtful
if there is another State in the Union
that can make sueh a showing.
A citizen of the Delta country has
written the railroad commission to
know whether or not the railroads have
a right to charge 4 cents fare where the
passenger does not have a ticket. Thai
has been the impression for some years.
The commission insists on it, and so do
the railroad companies. The idea is to
encourage passengers to pay their
money to the company's agents and not
,o the conductors, the latter objecting
to being bothered with cash fares.

J. B. Sale has been found not guilty
of the charge of murdering J. B. Bell.
This brings to a close one of the most
important criminal cases ever heard in
this State. Sale and Bell met one af
ternoon last July, on the streets ol
Aberdeen and engaged in a pistol duel,
in which Bell was killed and Sale
wounded. The trouble was the out
come of a business correspondence be

the rental of a house. Both families
are exceedingly prominent and wealthy.
The dead body of a well-dressed man
of 35 or 60 years of age was found on
the public highway near Ginster. On
the dead tnau were found letters ad

letters bear recommendations from the
pastor of the Baptist Church at Ocala,
stating that Rev. Moody was a minister
in good standing. The dead man wore
