"feel that action at thl? time is un

There oneht to be no division. But
it is not unsuitable to briefly state

Turning to Bulrarla, senator Lodgs
said there was no feeling of hostili

the "czar of the Bulgars." was en

"It would be difficult to find in
history." he said "a me-ner or baser

said. Is the tool of Germany. Bulgaria
has a legation in this city. If her of

they are traitors to their own gov

"Bulgaria is a tool, but It Is a
