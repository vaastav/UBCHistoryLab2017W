land within its borders is likely to
attract wide attention. This power by
the state is just what is needed at the
present time. The state cannot at
present purchase large quantities of land
for forest preserves or reservoirs for the
rainfall because it lacks money and the
voters would not vote the money. But
if it can regulate the cutting of timber on
private lands for the purpose of protect
ing public interests it has the power to
act in forest preservation before the
forests are gone.
It is time now for all citizens to consi
der seriously the best method of assum
ing control over forests and be ready to
take definite action next fall. The state
forester is interrogated to know what
course it any lie would recommend in
this matter. Lumber men are closelv
interested and they too should be pre
pared to give the public their side of the
case. J lie state must be careful to
evojve some plan that will not do injust
ice to the private parties if its acts are
to stand.

President Taft's Message.
The message of President Taft at the
opening of Congress has been accepted
by many papers as a very safe and sane
document without any especially strong
features. There are however some state
ments that must be recognized as un
usual and that indicate a determination
on the President's part to serve well the
interests of the people. After showing
that there willjbe a deficit of $73,075 620
at the end of the current fiscal year the
President says :-
In order to avoid a deficit for the en
suing fiscal year I directed the heads of
departments in the preparation of their
estimates to make them as low as poss-
loie consistent witn imperative govern
mental necessity, I he result has been,
as I am advised by the secretary of the
treasury, that the estimates of the ex
penses of the government for the fiscal
year ending June 30. 1911 that is, for
the next fiscal year are less by $55,663
000 than the total of appropriations for
the current hscal year are less by $94-,
000,000 than the estimat s for that
year. So far as the secretary of the
treasury is able to form a judgment as
to futnre income, there will be no deficit
in me year ending June au, mil, Dut a
small surplus of $712,000.
In the war department the estimates
have been cut to $45,000,000 less than
for the present year and the President
says :-
This could be accomplished only by
cutting off new projects and suspending
for the period of one year all progress in
military matters, tor the same reason
1 nave directed that the army shall not
be recruited up to its present authorized
strength.
Speaking of the navy department he
says :-
Owing to the necessity for economy in
expenditures, i nave directed the curtail
ment of recommendations for naval
appropriations so that they are thirty
eight millions less than the correspond
ing estimates of last vear, and the re
quest for new naval construction is
limited to two first class battleships and
one repair vessel.
nnoiner important statement is in
regard to injunctions in which he says
it lit 1 1 . i . 1 f
we Dcneve tnat the rules ol proce
dure in the leueral courts with respect to
the issuance of the writ of injunction
should be more accurately defined by
statute and that no injunction or tem
porary restraining order should be
issued without notice, except where
irreparable injury would result from
delay, in which case a speedy hearing
thereafter should be granted. "
I recommend that in compliance with
the promise thus made appropriate leg
islation be adopted. Moreover, every
such injunction or restraining order
issued without previous notice and op
portunity by the defendant to Ne heard
should by force of the statute expire and
be of no effect after seven days from the
issuance thereof or within any time less
than that period which the court may
ux. uniess witnin sucn seven days or
such less period the injunction or order
is extended or renewed after previous
nonce and opportunity to be heard.
His recommendation regarding politi
cal contributions is :-
i urgently recommend to congress
that a law be passed requiring that
candidates in elections of members of the
house of representatives and committees
in charge of their candidacy and cam
paign hie in a proper office of the United
States government a statement of the
contributions received and of the expend
itures incurred in the campaign for such
elections and that similar legislation be
enacted in respect to all other elections
which are constitutionally within the
control oi congress.
It must be admitted by all that the
President has taken the strongest stand
of any executive of recent years, for a
careful expenditure of the government
revenues, that he has put an effective
quietus on any spirit of jingoism that
develops with the enlargement of the
army and navy and that the country is
likely to experience an off year in war
scares. His position on the question of
injunctions is in advance of that taken
by any other president and is one that
would prevent any further abuse of that
privilege. Publicity of political contri
butions and expenses is another bold and
righteotft position for the chief executive
to assume and is a distinct advance in
the cause of pure politics. In all of these
thnigs one can see the determination of a
calm man to meet without equivocation
the duties that are before him without
an appeal to popular cla mor but to act
upon those principles which will give his
accomplishments greater strength and
permanency.
Better Things Promised.
If Franklin MacVeagh, secretary of the
treasury, spoke authoritatively at the
annual banquet of the Massachusetts
Bankers' association in Boston last
week his message will be recieved with
pleasure throughout the country. He
declared that the Payne tariff bill is but
an incident in a tariff revision in the
republican party which is definitely
committed to a revision downward,
that while there will be no more tariff
tinkering at present the Payne bill is not
final, that log rolling in connection with
tariff changes is at an end and that the
new tariff board will be a great, aid in
future revisions with the information it
will have on the subject.
The end of log rolling in tariff revision
would be a very important achievement,
so important in fact that the country
will need an actual demonstration be
fore it will be convinced the change has
come. If the day is near when actual
conditions shall determine the changes
to be made in our tariffs it will soon
eliminate the tariff question very largely
from politics and will afford proper
protection to American industries with
out permitting unreasonably high prices.
The school authorities in New York
city have ordered the abolishment

of what good business enterprise and a

Wants ta Prosecute Frauds.
In his annual report Attorney General
Wickersham speaking of the sugar frauds
says : "No effort will be spared to ascer
tain the precise amount of which the gov
ernment has been defrauded, to recover
all moneys due, and to punish all those
who may be found to have participated
in any respect in the frauds, whether as
officers or agents of the importers or as
officials of the government. I earnestly
request a special appropriation of $50,-
000 to enable this work to be effectively
prosecuted." It is to be hoped that Con
gress will grant his request and not at
tempt any grand stand investigation on
its own part. Prosecutions by the at
torney general would secure convictions
wherever possible while an investigation
by Congress would be very likelv to re
sult in the immunity of some guilty par
ties who had rather tell about the other
fellow's wrong doing than to take the
punishment for his own offenses
would cost the country more than $50,
000 too.

It is not a very flattering condition
among Vermont dairymen that shows
out of fifty-nine dairies examined in the
interests of the Massachusetts board of
health only twenty-nine were producing
good enough milk to be legally sold in
Massachusetts. Evidently Vermont
dairymen have considerable to learn vet,
Another thing to be thought of is are
the people in Vermont going to take
without question the products of a
dairy that Massachusetts has rejected.
Vermont is certainly entitled to as good
milk as any other section of the country
but it must assert itself if it is to have
it. Vermont farmers too should not be
satisfied until they produce milk that
will pass the test of any market.

book which will be placed on the market

sent to this office with the compliments
of the author, John II. Flagg of New

mington, Vt., but for thirty years past
has been a well known lawyer and club
man of New York City. In the winter
of 1900 he met with an accident and
since that time has been confined to his
home. His book is one of the products
of. his mind which retains its strength
and activity despite his physical misfor

PRESS COMMENT.
State Has the Power to Control Privately
Owned Forests,
Much has been heard of public forest
preserves, little at the tact that four
hltns ol the timber standing in this
country is privately owned. Not only
do private interests own four times as
much of the woods as the State and
Federal Governments own, but these
woods are the more valuable. Thev are
being burned over at an average loss of
tou.uuu.uuu. 1 hey are cut wastefu lv.
at the rate of three and a half times their
annual growth. One-fourth of the tim
ber is lost in logging. In the White
Mountains and on the Southern Annal,
achian range the forests that regulate
tne neaowaters ot enormous water
powers are being stripped fioni the
mountains.
these immensely valuable privately
owned forests are "subject to the State's
control, without purchase bv the States.
On April 6, 1908, Justice Holmes of the
Federal Supreme Court handed down a
decision sustaining the State of Maine in
its contention that its police power was
uucquaie to restrict tne cutting or
destruction of private forest coverts in a
way "to preserve or enhance the value of
such lands and trees thereon, and pro
tect and promote the interests of such
owners and the common welfare of the
people.' the principle has this broad
application, injustice Holmes' opinion
the State as quasi soverign and rep
resentative of the interests of the public
has a standing in court to protect the
atmosphere, the water, and the forests
within its territory, irrespective of the
assent or dissent of the private owners
of the land most immediately concerned."
The Times advises those vast interpsts
that are being ruined by the denuding of
tne vvnite Mountains and the Southern
Appalachians to abandon their attempt,
futile after sixteen years of continued
effort, to persuade Congress to buy
"limited strategic areas" in these regions
and to submit to Gov. Willson of Ken
tucky, Chairman of the Committee of the
House of Governors, a olan for uniform
State laws to control them in nrivate
ownership for the "common welfare of
the people.
Such a law, passed and enforced in
every State of the Union, would conserve
and increase its wealth more than any
other single project of legislation. The
New York Times.
Vermont's State Forest.
"Vermont, it is a pleasure to note, is
setting resolutely about the business of
conserving its remaining timber wealth,
and growing more, by methods that will
be determined by a trained state forester.
A tract of 450 acres, near Plainfield, has
been purchased and set apart for demon
strating methods of cultivation and cut
ting tnat will make the tract serve as an
experiment station for that section of
the state. Later similar work will be
undertaken in other sections. Vermont
has not suffered as New Hampshire has
from the forest strippers, and it is freer
from influences that obstruct sensible
plans of conservation." Boston Herald.
"Vermont's newly declared purpose
to keep her mountains 'in verdure clad'
is a commendable effort to continue
worthy ol the name she bears." IBos

it win be some gratification to Ver-
monters to see that already their
awakened interest in this great economic
matter and the efforts they have thus
lar put lorth to begin its adjustment are
meeting with favorable comment from
tneirgood neighbors.
In this connection, it maybe of interest
to Vermont readers that The Messenger
has used the word "awakened" unadvis-
mitting the evaporation to be the same
from the other leaves of the tree as it
was from those on which the experiment
was made, the quantity of water thrown
off from this tree in 'the space of 12
hours would be three hundred and thirty
n ne thousand and seventy-two grains.
Upon examining the number and dimen
sions of the trees which covered the
ground where I made the experiment,
1 tninu it would be a moderate computa
tion to estimate them as equal both in
magnitude and extent on every square
rod to four such trees as that which I
had examined. This will give 640 such
trees for the quantity of wood contained
on one acre. This estimation is less than
the quantity of wood which is generally
found upon one acre of land in this part
of America. The weight of one pint of
water is one pound avoirdupois, or
seven thousand grains Troy weight,
and eight such pints make one gallon.
Making the calculation upon these
principles, it will be found that from one
acre of land thus covered with trees,
three thousand eight hundred and seventy-five
gallons of water are thrown off
and dispersed in the atmosphere in the
space of twelve hours."
Perhaps modern investigators would
have a different way of making such a
test and might vary somewhat in the
figures set down from it, but Doctor
Williams made an easy demonstration
of the tremendous volume of moisture
that is taken up and stored bv the trees
on the hillsides onlv to find its wav
down again to feed the springs and
brooks and ponds that in their turn
husband the watto- supply of the villages

cussion was had upon the subject of
What the Grange Might Do ' followed
by a discussion of "The Temperance
Question from a Granger's Standpoint."
Speaking on the first subject Mr. Stocker
ot Danville called attention to the fact
that' the Wells Fargo Express company
had recently divided a dividend of 300
per cent among a few stockholders and
that the earnings of other express com
panies were enormous. He therefore
urged very strongly the establishment of
the parcels post and suggested further
that the grange work for the reduction of
court expenses.

Mr. Jacob L. Davis, Galena, Stone county, Mo., writes: "I have been In bad

fever, was very depleted. I could find nothing I could eat without causing dii

and after taking three or four bottles I was entirely cured of stomach trouble,
