AT PEACE MALI NATIONS
President Taft Sends in Special Message
Reviewing Our Relations With
Other Countries.
Imp or'ant General Movement for Broader Arbitration On
Fart of Powers is Noted—Mexican War Dis
cussed—Merchant Marine Needed.
Wu.-; dug ton, Dec. 7.—The first of Presi
dent Taft's promised special messages
was read in congress today. It deals en
tirely with foreign affairs. The message
In part follows:
The relations of the United States with
ether countries have continued during the
past twelve months upon a basis of the
Usual good will and friendly intercourse.
Arbitration.
The year just passed marks an im
portant general movement on the part of
the powers for broader arbitration. In
the recognition of the manifold benefits
to mankind In the extension of the policy
of the settlement of international dis
putes by arbitration rather than by war.
Hnd in response to a widespread demand
for an advance in that direction on the
part of the people of the United States
and of Great Britain and of France, new
arbitration treaties were negotiated last
spring with Great Britain and France,
the terms of which were designed, as
expressed In the preamble of these treat
ies, to extend the scope and obligations of
the policy of arbitration adopted in our
present treaties with those governments.
To pave the way for this treaty with the
United States, Great Britain negotiated
an Important modification in its alliance
with Japan and the French government
also expedited the negotiations with sig
nal good will. The new treaties have
been submitted to the senate and are
awaiting Its advice ana consent to their
ratification. Ail the essentials of these
Important treaties have long been known,
and it Is my earnest hope that they will
receive prompt and favorable action.
Claim of Alsop & Cos. Settled.
I am glad to report that on July 5 last
the American claim of Alsop & Cos.
against the government of Chile was
finally disposed of by the decision of his
Britannic majesty George V., to whom,
as amiable compositeur, the matter had
been referred for determination. His
majesty made an award of nearly $1,000,-
000 to the claimants, which was promptly
paid by Chile. The settlement of this
controversy hits happily eliminated from
the relations between the republic of
Chile and the United States the only
question which for two decades had giv
en the two foreign offices any serious
concern and makes possible the unob
structed development of the relations of
friendship which It has been the aim of
this government In every possible way to
further and cultivate.
Arbitrations.
In further illustration of the practical
and beneficent application of the princi
ple of arbitration and the underlying
broad spirit of conciliation, I am happy
to advert to the part of the United States
in faciltating amicable settlement of dis
putes which menaced the peace between
Panama and Costa Rica and between
Haiti and the Dominican republic.
Since the dote of their independence,
Colombia and Costa Rica had been seek
ing a solution of a boundary dispute,
wiiich came as a heritage from Colombia
to the new republic of Panama, upon its
beginning life as an Independent na
tion. In January, 1910, at the request of
both governments the agents represent
ing thorn met in conference at the depart
ment of state and subsequently conclud
ed a protocol submitting this long-pend
ing controversy to the arbitral judgment
of the chief justice of the United States,
who consented to act in this capacity. A
boundary commission, according to the
International agreement, has now been
appointed, and it is expected that the ar
guments will shortly proceed and that
this tong-standing dispxite will be honor
ably and satisfactorily terminated.
Again, a few months ago it appeared
that the Dominican republic and Haiti
were about to enter upon hostilities be
cause of complications growing out of an
acrimonious boundary dispute which the
efforts of many years had failed to solve.
The government of the United States, by
a friendly interposition of good offices,
succeeded in prevailing upon the oarties
to place their reliance upon some torm of
pacific settlement.
Mexico.
The lecent political events In Mexico
received attention from this government
because of the exceedingly delicate and
difficult situation created along our south
ern border and the necessity for taking
measures properly to safeguard Ameri
can interests. The government of the
United States, in its desire to secure a
proper observance and enforcement of
the so-called neutrality statutes of the
federal government, issued directions to
the appropriate officers to exercise a dili
gent and vigilant regard for the require
ments of such rules and laws. Although
a condition of actual armed conflict ex
isted, there was no official recognition of
belligerency involving the technical neu
trality obligations of International law.
On the 6th of March last. In the ab
sence of the secretary of state, I had a
personal Interview with Mr. Wilson, the
ambassador of the United States to Mex
ico, in which he reported to me that the
Conditions in Mexico were much more
critical than the press dispatches dis
closed: that President Diaz was on a vol
cano of popular uprising; that the small
outbreaks which had occurred were only
symptomatic of the whole condition; that
a very large per cent, of the people v/ere
In sympathy with the insurrection; that a
general explosion was probable at any
time, in which case ho feared that the
140,000 or more American residents in
Mexico might be assailed, and that 'he
very large American investments might
bo injured or destroyed.
After a conference with the secretary
of war and the secretary of the navy, I
thought It wise to assemble an army
division of full strength at San Antonio,
Tex., a brigade of three regiments at
Galveston, a brigade of infantry In the
Los Angeles district of southern Cali
fornia. together with a squadron of bat
tleships and cruisers and transports f.t
Galveston, and a small squadron of ships
at San Diego. At the same time, through
our representative at the City of Mexico
1 expressed to President Diaz the hope
that no apprehensions might result from
Unfounded conjectures as to these mili
tary maneuvers, and assured him that
they had no significance which should
cause concern to his government.
I am more than nappy to here record
tle fact that all apprehensions as to the
effect of thu presence of so largo a mili
tary force in Texas proved groundless;
xio disturbances occurred.
From time to time communications
■were received from Ambassador Wilson,
who had returned to Mexico, confirming
the view that the massing of American
troops in the neighborhood had had good
effect.
The insurrection continued and resulted
Jn engagements between the regular
Mexican troops and the insurgents, and
this along the border, so that in several
Instances bullets from the contending
forces struck American citizens engaged
Jn their lawful occupations on American
soil.
Proper protests were made against
these invasions of American rights to the
Mexican authorities.
The presence of a large military and
Tiaval force available for prompt action,
near the Mexican border, proved to be
the most fortunate under the somewhat
trying conditions presented by this inva
sion of American rights.
The policy and action of this govern
ment were based upon an earnest friend
liness for the Mexican people as a whole,
■and it is a matter of gratification to note
that this attitude of strict impartiality as
to all factions In Mexico and of sincere
Works Splendidly.

Honduras and Nicaragua Treaties
Proposed.
r sR’-iation in Central America,
1 have taken occasion In the past to em
phasize most strongly the importance that
should he attributed to the consumma
tion of the conventions between the re
publics of Nicaragua and of Honduras
and this country, and I again earnestly
recommend that the necessary advice and
consent of the senate be accorded to
these treaties, which will make it possi
ble for these Central American repub
lics to enter upon an era of genuine eco
nomic national development.
Our relations with the Republic of
Panama, peculiarly important, due to mu
tual obligations and the vast interests
created by the canal, have continued in
the usual friendly manner, and we have
been glad to make appropriate expres
sion of our attitude of sympathetic in
terest in tin 3 endeavors of our neighbor
in undertaking the development cf the
rich resources of the country.
The Chinese Loans.
The past year has been marked in our
relations with China by the conclusion
of two important International loans, one
for the construction of the Hukuang rail
ways, the other for the carrying out of
the currency reform to which China was
pledged, by treaties with the United
States, Great Britain and Japan, of
which mention was made In my last an
nual message.
Especially Important at the present,
when the ancient Chinese empire is shak
en by civil war incidental to its awaken
ing to the many influences and activity
of moderlzation. are the co-operative pol
icy of good understanding which has been
fostered by the International projects re
ferred to above and the general sym
pathy of view- among all the powers in
terested in the far east.
New Japanese Treaty.
The treaty of commerce and navigation
between the United States and Japan,
signed in 1894, would by a strict inter
pretation of its provisions have terminat
ed on July 17, 1912. Japan’s general
treaties with the other powers, however,
terminated in 1911. and the Japanese gov
ernment expressed an earnest desire to
conduct the negotiations for anew treaty
with the United States simultaneously
with its negotiations with the other pow
ers. There were a number of important
questions involved in the treaty, includ
ing the immigration of laborers, revision
of the customs tariff and the right of
Americans to hold real estate in Japan.
The United States consented to waive all
technicalities and to enter at once upon
negotiations for anew treaty on the un
derstanding that there should be a con
tinuance throughout the life of the treaty
of the same effective measures for the
restriction of immigration of laborers to
American territory which had been In
operation with entire satisfaction to both
governments since 1908. The Japanese
government accepted this basis of nego
tiation. and anew treaty was quickly
concluded, resulting in a highly satisfac
tory settlement of the other questions re
ferred to.
Europe and the Near East,
In Europe and the near east, during the
past twelve-month, there has been at
times considerable political unrest. The
Moroccan question, which for some
months was the cause of great anxiety,
happily appears to have reached a stage
at which It need no longer be regarded
with concern. The Ottoman empire was
occupied for a period by strife In Al
bania and is now at war with Italy. In
Greece and the Balkan countries the
disquieting potentialities of this situation
have been more or less felt. Persia has
been the scene of a long internal strug
gle. These conditions have been the
cause of uneasiness in European diplo
macy, hut thus far without direct politi
cal concern to the United States.
In the war which unhappily exists be
tween Italy and Turkey this government
has no direct political interest, and I
took occasion at the suitable time to is
sue a proclamation of neutrality In that
conflict. At the same time all necessary
steps have been taken to safeguard the
personal Interests of American citizens
and organizations In so far as affect'd
by the war.
In spite of the attendant economic un
certainties and detriments to commerce,
the United States has gained markedly in
its commercial standing with certain of
the nations of the near east.
Coronation of King George V.
The 22d of June of the present, year
marked the coronation of his Britannic
majesty. King George V. In honor of
this auspicious occasion I sent a special
embassy to London. The courteous and
cordial welcome extended to tills gov
ernment’s representatives by his majesty
and the people of Great Britain has fur
ther emphasized the strong bonds of
friendship happily existing between the
two nations.
Settlement of Differences With Great
Britain.
As the result of a determined effort on
the part of both Great Britain and the
United States to settle all of their out
standing differences a number of treat
ies have been entered into between the
two countries in recent years, by which
nearly all of the unsettled questions be
tween them of any importance have been
adjusted by agrement or arrangements
made for their settlement by arbitration.
Recognition of Portuguese Republic,
The National Constituent assembly, reg
ularly elected by the vote of the Portu
guese people, having on l9 last
unanimously proclaimed a republican gov
ernment, the official recognition of the
government of the United States was
given to the new republic In the after
noon of the same day.
International Conventions and Confer
ences.
The supplementary protocol to The
Hague convention for the establishment
of an international prize court, mentioned
in my last annual message, embodying
stipulations providing for an alternative
procudure which would remove Hie con
stitutional objection to that part of The
Hague convention which provides that
there mav be an appeal to the proposed
court from the decisions of national
courts, has received the signature of

Fur-Seal Treaty.
The fur-seal controversy, which for
nearly twenty-five years has been the
source of serious friction between the
United States and the powers bordering
upon the north Pacific ocean, whose sub
jects have been permitted to engage in
pelagic sealing against the fur-seal herds
.laving their breeding grounds within the
jurisdiction of the United States, has at
iast been satisfactorily adjusted by the
conclusion of the North Pacific sealing
convention entered Into between the
United States. Great Britain, Japan and
Russia on the seventh of July last.
The attention of congress is especially
called to the necessity for legislation on
the part of the United States for the pur
pose of fulfilling the obligations assumed
under this convention, to which the sen
ate gave its advice and consent on th. 3 *
twenty-fourth day of July last.
International Opium Commission.
In a special message transmitted to the
congress on the seventh of January, 1911,
in which I concurred in the recommenda
tions made by the secretary of state in
regard to certain needful legislation for
the control of our interstate and foreign
traffic In opium and other menacing
drugs, I quoted from my annual mes
sage of December 7, 1909, In which I an
nounced that the results of the Interna
tional Opium commission held at Shang
hai in February, 1909, at the Invitation of
the United States, had been laid before
this government: that the report of that
commission showed that China was mak
ing remarkable progress and admirable
efforts toward the eradication of the
opium evil; that the interested govern
ments had not permitted their commer
cial interests to prevent their co-opera
tion in this reform; and, as a result of
callateral investigations of the opium
ouestion In this country, I recommended
that the manufacture, sale and use of
opium in the United States should be,
more rigorously, controlled by legislation.
Prior to that lime and in continuation
of the policy of this government to se
cure the co-operation of the interested
nations, the United States proposed an
international opium conference with full
Powers' for the purpose of ctothlng with
the force of international law the reso
lutions adopted bv the above-mentioned
commission, together with their essen
tial corollories. The other powers con
cerned cordially responded to the pro
posal of this government, and, I am glad
to he able to announce, representatives
of all the powers assembled in conference
at The Hague on the first of this month.
Foreign Trade Relations of the United
- States.
In my last annual message I referred
to the tariff negotiations off the depart
ment of state with foreign countries in
connection with the application, by a se
ries of proclamations, of the minimum
tariff of the United States to Importa
tions from the several countries, and I
stated that. In its general operation, sec
tion 2 of the new tariff law had proved
a guaranty of continued commercial
peace, although there were, unfortunate
ly, instances where foreign governments
dealt arbitrarily with American interests
within their Jurisdiction in a manner in
jurious and inequitable. During the past
year some instances of discriminatory
treatment have been removed, but I re
gret to say that there remain a few
cases of differential treatment adverse to
the commerce of the United States. While
none of these instances now appears to
amount to undue discrimination in the
sense of section 2 of the tariff law of
August 5, 1909, they are all exceptions to
that complete degree of equality of tar
iff treatment that the department of
state has consistently sought to obtain
for American commerce abroad.
While the double tariff feature of the
tariff law- of 1909 has been amply Justi
fied by the results achieved in removing
former and preventing new, undue dis
criminations against American commerce.
It is believed that the time has come for
the amendment of this feature of the law
in such way as to provide a graduated
means of meeting varying degrees of
discriminatory treatment of American
commerce In foreign countries as well as
to protect the financial interests abroad
of American citizens against arbitrary
and injurious treatment on the part of
foreign governments through either leg
islative or administrative measures.
It would seem desirable that the maxi
mum tariff of the United States should
embrace within its purview the free list,
which is not the case at the present time,
in order that it might have reasonable
significance to the governments of those
countries from which the Importations
into the United States are confined vir
tually to articles on the free list.
The fiscal year ended June 30. 1911,
shows great progress in the development
o< American trade. It was noteworthy
as marking the highest record of exports
of American products to foreign coun
tries. the valuation being In excess of
$2,000,000,000. exports showed a
gain over the preceding year of more
than $300,000,000.
Crying Need for American Merchant
Marine.
I need hardly reiterate the conviction
IJiat there should speedily be built up an
American merchant marine. This is nec
essary to assure favorable transporta
tion facilities to our great ocean-borne
commerce as well as to supplement the
navy with an adequate reserve of ships
and men. It would have the economic ad
vantage of keeping at home part of the
vast sums now paid foreign shipping for
carrying American goods. All the great
commercial nations pay heacVy subsidies
to their merchant marine, so that it is
obvious that without some wise aid from
the congress the United States must lag
behind in the matter of merchant marine
In Its present anomalous position.
Legislation to facilitate the extension
of American banks to foreign countries is
another matter In which our foreign
trade needs assistance.
With these factors and the continuance
of the foreign-service established (depart
mental. diplomatic and consular) upon
the high plane where It has been placed
by the recent rearoganization this gov
ernment would be abreast of the times
in fostering the Interests of its foreign
trade, and the rest must be left to the
energy and enterprise of our business
men. *
Improvement of the Foreign Service.
The entire foreign-service organization
is being improved and developed with
especial regard to the requirements of
the commercial Interests of the country.
The rapid growth of our foreign trade
makes it of the utmost Importance that
governmental agencies through which
that trade is to be aided and protected
should possess a high degree of effi
ciency. Not only should the foreign rep
resentatives be maintained upon a gen
erous scale in so far as salaries and es
tablishments are concerned, but the se
lection and advancement of officers
should be definitely and permanently reg
ulated by law, so that the service shall
not fall to attract men of high character
and ability. The experience of the past
few vears with a partial application of
civil service rules to the dipufomatic and
consular service leaves no doubt in my
mind of the wisdom of a wider and more
permanent extension of those principles
to both branches of the foreign service.
I therefore again commend to the fa
vorable action of the congress the enact
ment of a law applying to the diplomatic
and consular service the principles em
bodied in section 1753 of the Revised Stat
utes of the United States, in the civil
service act of January 16.1853. and the
executive orders of June 27, 1906, and of
November 26, 1909. In its consideration of
this important subject I desire to recall
to the attention of the congress the very
favorable report made on the Bowden
bill for the improvement of the
foreign service by the foreign
affairs committee of the house of repre
sentatives. Available statistics show that
the strictness with which the merit sys
tem has ben applied to the foreign serv
ice during recent years and the absolute
non-partisan selection of consuls and
diplomatic service secretaries who Indeed
far from being selected with any view
to political consideration have actually
been chosen to a disproportionate extent
from states which would have been un
represented in the foreign service under
the system wihch it is to be hoped is now
permanently obsolete. Some legislation
for the perpetuation of the present sys
tem of examinations and promotions upon
merit and efficiency would be of greatest
value to our commercial and internation
al Interests.

UNIVERSITY SPENDS
ICHJJUILDING
Work Now Under Way orf Eight
Structures at Madison.
COST WILL BE $1,000,000
Dome of Old State Capito! to Be Re
assembled and Placea on Top of
Main Hall When Necessar/ Appro
priation Is Made by LegislaU re.
Madison.—The University of Wis
consin is just now in the greatest
building era of its history, over
$1,000,000 being spent in new build
ings at this time, (sine new build
ings will cost at least $1,000,000.
One is nearly completed, two are in
process of completion, and work has
begun on five others.
Among the plans of the university
are those which call for the erection
of a big dome on top of University
hall. The dome, which formerly
stood on top of the old capitol build
ing, lies piled in order behind Main
hall, waiting an appropriation from
the legislature for the financing of
the job. With the new dome on
Main hall, the structure will have an
imposing appearance. The dome
weighs 1,000,000 pounds.
MUST SELL SOAP BY WEIGHT
Only Articles in Natural State Come
Under Numerical Count Provis
ion, Says Attorney General.
Madison.—“ Numerical count” as
fised in the Wisconsin weights and
measures law passed by the last leg
islature, is limited to apply only to
articles in their natural state, such
as apples, eggs, etc., according to an
opinion from the office of Attorney
General Bancroft.
The law provides that “all dry
commodities not otherwise specified
in this section shall be bought and
sold only by standard dry measure,
standard weight or numerical count,
except when parties otherwise agree
in writing.”
“The evident intent of the law,”
says the attorney general, “was to
secure to the consumer the full
amount of any commodity for which
he supposes he is paying. An opin
ion is cited in which it is held that
meats, wrapped In many thicknesses
of paper, cheese cloth, etc., should lj>e
sold at the net weight of the meat.”
An interesting aspect of this con
struction of the law is that mer
chants may no longer sell soap at six
bars for a quarter or other stated
number of bars for a given sum, for
soap is not a natural product as in
terpreted in the opinion of the attor
ney general.
DIETZ TRIALS TRANSFERRED

Black River Falls.—This city is
again at the mercy of the waters of
the Black river. The water has been
rising rapidly and the pontoon bridge
built by the Omaha railroad and
donated to the city has been torn
from its moorings by the ice which
formed above and was borne down
upon the structure by the rising
flood. Part of the coffer dam which
the state is erecting in the river with
the object of throwing the river back
into the old channel has been washed
away. The river is rising and fears
of a repetition of last fall’s disaster
are entertained.

SEVENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF ESTABLISHMENT OF STATE CAPITAL AT
MADISON RECALLS INTERESTING HISTORY OF WISCONSIN'S EARLY DAYS
[: "' *" ’’' Tamil l;
Hall at Belmont Where First Legislature Met.
Madison. Seventy-five years ago, on
Nov. 30, 1836, the city of Madison was
chosen by the members of the first terri
torial legislature as the location of the
capital of the state of Wisconsin.
There were at the time many other
cities of the state which were appealing
for the honor of containing the chief
offi(>es and capitol building of the state,
but after a system of lobbying had been
indulged in. which would have done credit
or discredit to any succeeding legislature.
Madison received a majority of the votes
of the members and preparations for the
erection of the legislatve hall was com
menced. In the whole of Dane county at
that time there were but thirty persons.
Henry Dodge had been appointed gov
ernor of the territory of Wisconsin, es
tablished by act of congress on April 30.
1836, and on July 4 of the same year the
new officers were inaugurated, anil in his
inaugural address the governor spoke of
the difficulties of selecting a place for
capitol of the state.
Immediately after the convening of the
territorial legislature men began to ap
pear at Belmont, where the sessions were
being held and presenting the claims and
qualifications of Fond du Lae, Portage,
