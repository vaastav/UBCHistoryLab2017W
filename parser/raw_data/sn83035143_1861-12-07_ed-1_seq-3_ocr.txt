dered with a detachment to make tha at
tack by Gen. Co, but their force waa too
mall. Col. Pe Villiera, together with Col.
Woodruff, was requested to go and aee that
everything was properly conducted, and to
prevent th burning of the buildings. Gen.
Cox desired De Villier to go, aa be knew the
ground well "and," aaid Col. De V., "I
did, ladies and gentlemen." They were de

upon the battle field, ha remonstrated with
the officers and men he met, telling thorn it
was wrong to destroy an enemy's property
wantonly (aa the rebol were at that time
engaged upon such work) but he was met
by a demand to turronder. lie complied,
remarking that it was, perhaps, no use to
fight against three or four hundred men.
lie was taken to Tompkins' farm, and when
led Into the house, he wa astonished to find
bi companions, Cols. Wood'UlT and NetT,
priaoucia alto, ai he thought they had 01
caotd; but they were captured beforo.
They were well guarded, and at t o'clock
in the morning, they were taken by Captain
Jenkin to Charleston, and there introduced
tu Gov. Wise, who insultingly remarked to
them he would furnish them with A long
boarding house. While here, they obtained
perm isaion to send for neoeaaary clothing,
which waa forwarded; but they never re
ceived them, for the ruffians broke up their
trunks and stole everything that was in
them, and that under a flag of truce I In
his trunk A note waa found from Gen. Cox,
who declared be would be in Charleston
soon and rescue them. . Fearing this, per
haps, God. Wise hurried them off to Rich
mond. Wherever met on the road, they
were greeted with cries of "Take the Yan
kee out and hang them I"
Arrived in Richmond, they were taken to
a tobacoo warehouse, where they found forty
other priaoner. In the room there was nei
ther Uble or bed. Tbey were kept without
food: no breakfast given them the next
mo.'oing after their arrival and when,
finally-, a little bread waa brought thorn, it
waa thrown upon the floor aa to a do; and
the quantity ao small, that every mu must
make doubla quick in grabbing it, or he got
none, And waa compelled to beg frcin the
other. But there were rich oflloer who
could okv aomelbing to eat; for if the rebels
did not love the Northerner , they loved their
gold. But to shorten ; he got the brain fever
in prison, and waa removed to the hospital,
n,l h.r ttiA Colonel took occasion to affirm
that the kindnesa which had been spoken of
as practiced by the pbysiciana, wa not rrom
MUi hut fmm our own surgeons.
Being by profession a doctor, Col. DeV.,
when he had aufliciently recovered, was
asked by the hospital doctor to Assist, which
he consented to do; And he waa thua permit

tinel, he was challenged and forbidden to
pass, on the ground of being a prisoner; the
order of the General did not indulge him.
Now, as thev called him a French Yankee,
he thought he would play them a Yankee
trick ; son wrote a note stating that he was
included. When he returned to the hoapi
ui tha totuil nhvaician said he had been
practising deceit, and must, consequently,

incarcerated and put in irons. He soon

by the rebels, but, said he, I have taken an

of this Union, and oould never forget that he
came here for Liberty's sak. -

further took the trouble of writing a special

Editort Harming Leader: Our orders to
proceed from the Big Sandy River to Cov
iDgtoa, thence by the Kentucky Central
Railroad to Lexington, were countermanded
on our arrival at the former place. The
fleet which conveyed Gen. Nolson' Brigade
and our Battery to Louisville, consisted ef
the steamer Jacob Strader, Boston, Bostona
No. 1, Champion No. 4, MoClellan and
Rocket. Stopped at Covington but sufficient
time to procure rations and forage, and then
moved on towards Louisville, where we ar
rived on Monday the 25th inL After re
moving the battery and baggage wagon
from the steamers, we immediately proceed
ed out to our present camp, which is situated
about five miles fromLouisville in'lhe woods,
adjoining Camp Buell. There are now four
full batteries of light artillery in CAmp, tu.,
one battery of regulars; one from Indian
apolis, Ind., one from Michigan City, and
fonkle's, A battalion of light artillery is to
be organised at this camp during the present
month, to be under the command of Capt.
Terrill, XJ. 8 A. Capt. Terrill is a thorough
gentleman and a strict disciplinarian, and
ia much liked by th officers under his control.-
All officers are required to learn les
sons and recite before him daily.
The following Ohio regiments ar now in
Camp Buell: 2d, 3d, 6th, 8th, 19th, Slat,
23rd, 4Ut, Slat and 69th. Th lUt, under
the gallant Col. Haxen, and a section of Ar
tillery from Edgsrton's Battery, under Lieut.
Northrop, Arrived her last Thursday on the
steamer Telegraph, from Gallipolis. The
remainder of the battery arrived last night,
direct trom Camp Dennison. Capt. Edgar
ton is expected to-morrow, he having gone
to Columbus on business connected with his
battery. As to our battery, it is nearly "used
up," both a regards men and horses. That
expedition to Piketon has not its parallel
since the commencement of the war. A
hardier set of men, nor Abetter lot of horses
than ours were, when we moved fremCamp
Dennison, Oct 15th, could not have been
found in the Buckeye State. To form some
what of an idea of the present condition of
our horse, just step into th stables of the
celebrated (colored) Cleveland horse trader
Davis, and look over his stock. Sergeant
Nat. Newell aays (and he knows) that the
above would be a fair comparison, providing
Davis's stock has not improved since his de
parture from Cleveland. Forty-two of our
men are on the aick list, and the number
is daily increasing. Capt. Eonkle ha been
quite indisposed during the past week, but
ia better to-day. Lieutenants Porter, Pea

pounds Sheep, second quality, per head, $3

The Crescent also says the decrease in ex
change of $274,000 on the week is attrib
uted to the desire to place funds in England
to invest in merchandize, sterling having
been taken freely at 125 to 126. We are
not aware of any prospective improvement
in commerce to warrant these figures, which
are much bigber than in the Bankrupt Era of
1837 and 1640. It is bruited about that some
parties are placing all their funds in Europe
for fear, perhaps, of the highway rabbers et
the world that may penetrate our good city.

Price was besieging Lexingtoti a delegation
of citirens was aent to bim front Balm

not allow hi army to enter that county,
