A dispatch from Ronic» dated Dec.

blessing upon President-elect Taft
and his family on hearing from Arch

interchange of courtesies may give the

that Taft was elected by the "Cath

The Minneapolis Tribune, In an edi

NO CATHOLIC VOTE.
The Catholic Messenger, of Daven

gent layman, denies very strongly that
there is any Catholic vote In this coun
try. He Is right. Catholics vote as
individuals, and not in a body and
there Is no record in existence that the
hierarchy or clergy of the Catholic
church have dictated to the laymen
how or for whom they shall vote at a
municipal, state or national election.
If any disappointed politician or enemy
of the Catholic church has any tang­|
ible proof to the contrary, let him pro
duce it, or hold his peace.

the Democratic Irish vote was par
ticularly turned to Taft," the Inde
pendent to the contrary, notwithstand
ing. It certainly was not turned to him In
Minnesota, so far as we can find out.
The Irish in this state have always
been the staunchest supporters of
William J. Bryan, and they admire him
now as much as ever. As for the
question of religion, it has never en
tered into the politics of the Irish
American voters, and who says other
vise speaks or writes falsely of them.
They vote according to their political
convictions and are not swayed by re
ligious .prejudices, like some of the
native, non-Catholic voters.
As regards the Catholic journals, n
•y.
fcrred to by the Independent, some of
them kept politics entirely in the
background while others, like the
Irish Standard and the Catholic Mes
senger, supported Bryan in the three
campaigns. It is not true that "none
of the Catholic journals had anything
to say against Taft" and that they
"praised him." It is a fact, however,
tnat all Catholic publications have al
ways given Taft credit for disposing
of matters equitably and fairly be
tween this government and the Spanish
friars in the Philippines. If the editor
of the Independent or any of the dis
gruntled correspondents of the .Com
moner, who charge the defeat of Bry
an to the "Catholic vote,'1 were in
Taft's place, they would not have set
tkd the question so satisfactorily to
all parties concerned. We have no
hesitation in giving William H. Taft
full credit for making the most of a
bad job. He did well, and deserves
whatever credit is due him for bring
ing order out of chaos and saving the
friars' property from confiscation. That
was simple justice, and honest men
bt every denomination will not with
hold their approval of his act.
The Irish Standard does not believe
for a moment that the so-called "Cath
olic vote," which Is non-existent, de
feated William J. Bryan. We believe
that many citizens of the Catholic
faith voted for Taft, but they are those
I who would not have voted for Bryan
in any event. Many Catholics voted
against Bryan for the same reasons
that many Protestants voted against
him—not on religious grounds, but on
political grounds. Catholics have a
right to vote for whom they please,
and they should not be required to
give any explanation for their pref
erences. When it is said, however,
that their voting is influenced by
pope or bishop or priest, the charge
absolutely and unqualifiedly false, no
matter from what quarter it emanates.
We may add in conclusion that the
bishops and priests of the Catholic
church have their own Individual pref
erences and vote like the laymen,
according to political training and
conviction.
BRITISH RULE IN INDIA.
The Liberal party of Great Britain
has plenty of trouble at home and
abroad. In India, the natives, are be
coming restive, under British rule, and
an insurrection is likely to occur at
any moment. The educated Hindoos
are teaching the oppressed natives
that they are entitled to the rights of
which they have been deprived since
tlie days of Warren Hastings.
Any one who reads Burke's impeach
ment of Hastings knows how British
ml® was established in India in the
eighteenth century and what barbari
ties were perpetrated by that cruel
government in bringing the people un
der subjection.
The British first obtained a footing
in India under the guise of trade.
James Montgomery, the Scottish poet,
tells it as follows:
War, disguised as commerce, came
Britain, carrying sword and flame,
Won an empire—lost her name.
For uttering this plain truth in
rhyme, the poet was arrested and cast
I into a British dungeon.
Abortive attempts have been made,
from time to time, by the Hindoos to
throw off the galling yoke of Britain,
love freedom and believe that
I death is preferable to slavery. The
British employ spies and informers to
away the lives of rebellious na
tives, as they used to dp in Ireland.
But as in Ireland, so also in India the
life of the informer is a dangerous
one. Only recently in India, an in
former named Gossain was assassinated
for his treachery, and two Hindoos
named Satyendra Nath Bose and
Kanai Lai Dutt were hanged for the
crime. The latter was cremate^ after
his execution to strike terror into the
minds of the natives. By a majority
of three to two the jury which tried
him found him not guilty. The judge
disagreed and referred the case to the
High Court, which passed the death
sentence in a judgment which the
Indian Daily News characterized as
rot "very conclusive." One would
think that the Norburys, the Keoghs
and the Jeffrys, the Infamous English
and Irish judges, had come to life
again In the Orient to pass sentences
of death on the leaders of a struggling
race, panting for freedom.
No Bengalis were permitted to wit
ness the hanging of Dutt, and none
were allowed to carry off any of his
ashes after the cremation. A corre
spondent of the London Daily Mail
at Calcutta says that large sums of
money were offered for pieces of the
fatal rope and parts of the ashes of
Dutt, on whom the natives looked aB
a martyr.
British statesmen have a hard prob
lem before them In India, and it cannot
le solved by cruel executions. Tha
people want self-government of some
kind, and England has had a long time
to prepare then\ for It. As an intelli
gent Indian has said, the fault of Brit
ish rule in India is that the Indians
are refused their own institutions and
obtain but the shell of British insti
tutions. Why does not England try
the Amerlcah system of government

quest of India, It was a land of in
calculable wealth. The natives wer#
prosperous and happy. The blight of
British civilization has changed all
that. The odious officialism of Its
rulers has brought poverty and famine
in its train. It has created dissension
among the various classes and kept
them from uniting, but the natives are
seeing the light, and before the English
know it, a terrible retribution will fall
upon the bloodsuckers of that once
mighty empire, which will break Its
chains and become free and inde
pendent as of yore. May Qod speed
the day.
PULITZER AND PRESIDENT.
Last Tuesday President RooBevelt
addressed another message to Con
gress in which he violently assailed
Joseph Pulitzer, the responsible editor
of the New York World, for articles
which appeared in that paper demand
ing information about the forty mil
lion dollars paid by the government
in connection with the Panama Canal.
The epithets applied by Roosevelt to
Pulitzer in the message caused the
solons to laugh, and t.hey thanked their
stars that they were not the victims
of his vituperation. A Washington
dispatch says:
"The senators and representatives

IN PASSING
Ignatius McMamee, of Portland,
Ore., recently won the Breen gold
medal for oratory at Notre Dame Uni
versity. He will represent that great
educational institution in the State
contest and his admirers fondly hope
that he will win the victory from all
his competitors.
While in Washington laBt week, Gov.
John A. Johnson said to a reporter:
"I think the Democratic party is in a
better position than it was before the
campaign opened. I do not think the
leaders of the Democratic Party are
cast down by defeat, and if they art
right, as I think they are, they will
win eventually."
The British authorities in India are
wreaking vengeance upon the native
patriots. Two of the leading Hindoos
were recently executed in a barbarous
manner, and to .destroy every vestige
of them, the bodies of the mangled men
were cremated. There Is a day of
reckoning for the English in far otf
Hindostan, and from every indication
it is near at hand.
President Cyrus Northrop, of the
University of Minnesota, has consent
ed to remain at the head of that in
stitution until the board of regents
shall have found a successor. It can
be safely asserted that the regents will
not be In a hurry to find a successor.
Dr. Northrop is capable of discharging
the duties of President for many years
to come.
Very Rev. C. H. McKenna, O. P.,
who for over forty years was engaged
in establishing the Holy Name Society
in the Eastern States, has gone to the
far West, where he expects to remain
four months. The Dominican provin
cial of California, Very Rev. A. L. Mc
Mahon, O. P., has invited Father Mc
Kenna to help propogate the Holy
Name and Rosary societies in the
towns and cities of the Pacific slope*
Bishop Spalding, of Peoria, one of
the most eminent prelates of America,
has addressed a farewell letter to the
priests and faithful of his diocese. He
says in conclusion: "Though no
longer your bishop, it is my hope that
I shall be permitted to spend the re
mainder of my days with you. Be
Mindful of me in your prayers and
supplications as one who walked
modestly and lovingly among you, do
ing as best he could: the work God
gave him to do."
Editor O'Shea, of the China Gazette,
has been sentenced to two months' im
prisonment at Shanghai for attacking
Judge Wllfley in his paper. Wllfley
made himself obnoxious to the Catho
lics of China because of his bigoted
utterances, and Roosevelt was asked to
recall him some time ago. It appears
he recently resigned, which mean
that his services were no longer re
quired in the Flowery Kingdom.
O'Shea is a British subject, and the
libel suit was tried In the British
court. He is suffering in a good cause
and has the satisfaction of knowing
that Wllfley has left China forever,
Rev. Lewis Drummond, S. J., was
given a farewell reception by the Cath
olic club at Winnipeg on Sunday af
ter noon, Dec. 5, before his departure
for Ontario, where he is to remain
permanently. He will probably leave

his work at the Jesuit ehureh at
Guelph. Fr. Drummond Is 60 years
r.f age, hall and hearty. He has been
at St. Boniface college for more than
twenty years, and is celebrated as an
educator, lecturer and journalist. The
English speaking Catholics of Mani
toba will sadly miss him. We wish
him every success ln his new position,
and regret that he 1b leaving Winnipeg
and the "Central Catholic" which he
has so ably edited for many years
under the name of the Northwest Re
view.
