HENDERSON FOB SPEAKER.
An educational campaign is not such
a bad thing, after all. It *is generally;
the case that the persons who do. the
educating immolate themselves on the,
altar of a good cause, and but few sur
vive to reap the rewards of their labor.
It was so with the educational cam
paign conducted by the tariff reformers
in the late national contest. While Mr..
Cleveland and his' associates went
down in the contest, still the seed sown
by them fell into good ground, and al
ready promises to ripen into an abun
dant harvest. The struggle now going
on in the Republican party for the con
trol of the organization of the next
congress demonstrates this. The lines
are being sharply drawn between tho
Eastern and Western members, and
there is evidently to be a bitter struggle
over the speakership. Only a week or
two ago it was thought that either
Reed, of Maine, or McKinley, of
Ohio, would have a walk-over for the
speakership. The only question then
was as to which was best qualified to
fill the speaker's chair, and which was
best qualified to lead his party on the
floor. Now it is a grave question
whether either can be elected speaker;
or, if elected, it will certainly be by
the hardest kind of fighting. Both
Reed aud McKinley are recognized
as special champions of the protection
idea, audit is for just that reason such
strong opposition to their election has
been developed inside the Republican.,
party. Gen. Henderson, of lowa, has
shied his castor into the speakership
ring, and so has Congressman Ryan,
of Kansas— both of them representa
tives of the tariff reform idea. Gen.
Henderson is making an active can
vass for the speakership, and bases his
claim to the office upon the ground that
Western ideas must prevail in the fut
ure legislation of the country. His
friends say that the election of
either Reed or McKinley would be
menacing to Western interests be
cause of their strong protection in
clinations, and that the election of
Henderson, or some other good man
of pronounced Western views, is es
sential to maintaining Republican su
premacy in the Western states. Thus
the issue of tariff "reform is forced upon
the next congress even before it as
sembles, and it is forged to the front by
the very party that was supposed to
have triumphed on ; a protection plat
form. " . 7 _
We are inclined to think that Gen.
Henderson will be worsted in his
struggle for the speakership, yet
we wish him well. The protec
tionists are so strongly entrenched
and have so many strings on the incom
ing administration, we do not see now
they are to be set back. Still, we are
gratified that the Western Republicans
have decided to make a bold stand in a
fight for V» estern ideas. It is an indica
tion of increasing intelligence and in
dependence in politics. If Allison
goes into the treasury department and
Henderson should succeed in captur
ing the speakership, the money kings of
Wall street and the protectionists of the
East would be convinced that Provi
dence had chosen the Republican party
as His instrument for putting Demo
cratic doctrines into effect.

. CLEAN YOUR WHEAT. .
Farmers who are in the habit of com
plaining about the grading of their
wheat, and of the warehouse expenses
that accumulate, would do well to read
Grain Inspector James' recent report,
for in it they will probably find some of
the causes for the troubles of which
they complain. The grain inspector's
report shows that there were 115,215 cars
of wheat handled this year against 113,
--923 last year, or a gain of 1,292 cars, yet
there was a falling off in the net bush
els of wheat. The reason of this falling
off was because of the dirty con
dition of the wheat. If the farmers
would take more pains in cleaning their
grain they would get a more satisfactory
grading, and at the same time would save
a considerable expense on the amount
of dirt they ship. Inspector James
says that in the 67,000,000 bushels re
ceived and inspected this season the
foul matter ranged from one-half a
pound to ten pounds to the bushel. In
order to keep up the standard of Minne
sota wheat in the markets, it is abso
lutely necessary that when the grain
goes from the public elevators it shall
be perfectly clean. If the farmers neg
lect to clean it themselves they should
not complain of the expense incurred in
having it cleaned. -A.

RACE SEPARATION.
Probably from the force of habit, the
Republican press hoisted the bloody
shirt immediately upon a declaration
made by Congressman Oates, of Ala
bama, the other day, that the only way
to break the Solid South was to elimi
nate the negro vote. It was amusing,
however, to observe how quickly the
ensanguined garment was hauled down
when that typical Kansas statesman,
John James Ingalls, stepped up to
Mr. Oates' side and signified his readi
ness to back him up in the statement.
For some time Senator Ingalls has
been an advocate of race separation, and
on one or two occasions expressed
views on this subject that sub
jected him to harsh criticism from his
own party associates. Now that the
election is over, and his opinions can do
no injury tothe Republican party, Mr.
Ingalls talks more freely than lie has
heretofore done.. He says that he is
satisfied the change from slavery to
treedom, from subordination to race
eqnality, has complicated instead of
simplified the the race problem. So far
from solving the fatal problem, the
change has added new elements of dif
ficulty and danger. His study of his
tory has convinced him that it is not
possible for two distinct races not homo
geneous to exist upon terms of prac
tical equality under the same govern
ment. One or the other must go to .the
wall. "The black race is not only grow
ing blacker," says Senator Ingalls,
"but it is increasing numerically much
more rapidly than the white race. This
is a fact of ominous significance, and
adds to the gravity of the issue."
Sneaking of the usual campaign alle
gation that the black vote is suppressed
in the Southern states, or, if they, vote,
their ballots are not counted, Mr. In
galls is inclined to accept the truth of
it. Yet lie is frank enough to • say that
the Southern whites are sincere in their
belief that the negro race is not capa
ble of self-government, and that negro
supremacy in the those states would re
sult in the degradation and destruction
of society and of the state. He is fur
thermore of opinion that if the same
conditions existed in any state north of
the Potomac they would-be followed by
precisely the same results. The white
race would maintain its supremacy.even
though it had to .be! done by bal
lot suppression. Therefore, he is
all 7" the '■• 7 more convinced of the
impossibility ot two such distinct races
living together on terms of exact equal
ity. He is satisfied in his ; own mind
that race ', antagonism in the \ Southern

stales is a permanent "condition, j and
that by reason of- their superior intelli
gence, wealth and morality . the whites
must remain supreme. 7 He _ therefore,

the colonizing of the * negroes in the
West India islands,' along the lowlands "
of Mexico . or some place where ■-. the re
gions, and environments 7 would ;-. be
\ friendly to the African blood. His idea
is to have the negroes colonized under
the protection of the United States; that
they would be subjects of -its ■ govern
ment and full : sharers of 7 its . citizen
ship, and that thus they may yet ac
complish their destiny and fulfill the
prophecy that Ethiopia * shall stretch
out its hands to God and rejoice.
RANDALL ON DECK.
The way things have .turned out, Mr.
Randall is apt to wield more influence
during this session of . congress than in
the last. There is no longer a necessity
for ruling him out of the party on ac
count of his peculiar tariff notions, or
of relegating him to the rear while the
party formed its line of battle. Mr.
Randall's eminent qualifications as a
parliamentarian will make him service
able to the party in ttie future as they
have in the past, and he will now move
up in the. front row. It is therefore
gratifying to hear Mr. Randall speak
plainly of his purpose to resist all
attempts the Republicans may make to
dispose of the surplus by extravagant
appropriations. ' He intends to sit on
the safely valve of the treasury, and
while he is there no damage need be
apprehended.

A MECHANIC'S LIEN LAW.
The Farmers' Alliance did right in
recommending to the legislature the
passage of a mechanic's lien law, but it
did wrong in passing resolutions reflect
ing upon the supreme court for its de
cision relating to the Lucas law. When
a capitalist loans money lie can secure
himself by a lien on property. A me
chanic's labor is his capital, and he
should have the same remedy that the
moneyed man has. But it doesn't fol
low that such a law as that passed by
the last legislature is infallible
simply because it is entitled a me
chanic's lien law. The decision
rendered by the supreme court showed
most conclusively that the. Lucas law
was not only in violation of the spirit
and the letter of the state constitution,
but it was practically inoperative, and
in reality afforded no protection for me
chanics.* Unfortunately, in adopting it
the legislature repealed the old law.
We agree that the legislature should
pass a law to protect laboring men in
their wages, but let it be a law that will
accomplish the ends sought.
THE FRANKING PRIVILEGE.
It is evident that Postmaster General
Dickinson knows but little of the nat
ure of a congressman, or he would
never have rung in that superannuated
chestnut in his report recommending
the abolition of the franking privilege.;
The same recommendation has been
made by every postmaster general for
the last forty years, and without the
least bit of effect on congress. The
average congressman is only a man,
after all, and he is not apt to let go of a
good thing when he has a grip on it. It
is easier to add to than to subtract from
the perquisites of a public official.
But, after all. it is a question whether
the proposition to furnish members
of congress with an allowance for
postage stamps in place of the franking
privilege is a wise one. If the principle
is correct that government officials are
entitled to a free use of the mails, the
simplest form for providing them with
that facility is . the franking privileges
The abuse of the stationery allowance
received by congressmen is surely as
great as the abuse of the franking priv

THE WATER SUPPLY.
The report of the . water board sub
mitted yesterday shows a satisfactory
condition of the city's water supply.
The subjects of main interest embodied
in the report relate to the construction
of the new high service reservoir and
the hydrant system. As will be seen
by the report, printed in another col
umn, satisfactory progress has been
made on the former, while the hydrant
system is believed to be sufficient for
all demands. It will be agreeable news
to our property holders that the cost of
street, sprinkling is to be materially re
duced, and in this connection we vent
ure the -hope that there will be water
enough put on the streets to keep the

"Hungry Joe," the Famous
Bunco Sharp, Nabbed by
Inspector Byrne.
New York, Dec. Addie Stanton,
Ella Hammond, Edward Meredith and
Henry Hermann were to-day arraigned
-in a crowded court room charged with
having attempted to rob Phil Daly, the
sporting man, in a Fourth avenue flat
last Monday. Hermann has made a full
confession.. The other three prisoners,
Mrs. Stanton, Mrs. Hermann and Mere
dith, were held without bail to await
the action of the grand jury. Added to
.the interest in the court scenes was the
fact, which had become known to
many present, that during the
morning Mrs. Anna Hermann
the aged mother of Henry Hermann,
attempted suicide after ; hearing of her
son's disgrace. She tried to strangle
herself with her hands. Then she fell
down in spasms. She was resuscitated
with difficulty and made no subsequent
attempt on her life, and while the law
yers took their places and the crowd
surged in, a slight and prepossessing
woman of middle age, accompanied by
one younger, was making her way to a
front seat into which she sank.
It was the wife, and also the
sister of Hermann, one of the
conspirators soon to be arraigned.
Daly, the wounded man and intended
victim first arrived. Then came two
detectives who escorted into a private
room a fine looking man of thirty-five.
He was tall and of slender build, with
sharp features and a prominent nose
upon which rested a pair of gold
rimmed eyeglasses, He wore a silver
bracelet on his left wrist which he tried
hard to conceal, but could not because a
similar one with a steel chain attached
was locked to the wrist of a detective.
Tins was Edward Meredith accused of
concocting the scheme to rob Daly and
hold his body for a ransom of $80,000.
He was the .
MAN WHO FIRED THE SHOT
that almost cost Daly his life. In an
other room 01. the opposite side of the
court was Detective Rush. He had a
compactly built fellow about thirty-five
' years old. This man was Henry Her
mann, accused of being an accomplice
of Meredith. He was perfectly self
.possessed. Hermann had turned state's
evidence. Meredith kept a close mouth
and could not be prevailed upon to im
plicate himself. Just before the hear
ing opened an exceedingly dramatic
scene occurred in the ante-chamber ot
the court. Phil Daly was escorted into
the room on the left, where Meredith
was seated. The prisoner was told to
stand up. He did so. "Put on your
hat, ordered the detective as he threw
a white pocket handkerchief over his
prisoner's face. The order was obeyed.
Now say, "throw up your hands," said
the detective. Meredith refused to
obey this command, and 'stood silent
and motionless before his accuser with
i face covered. "That's the man that
shot me, lam sure," said Daly. Daly
was then taken to tho ante-chamber on
the other side of the court room, where
the same scene was repeated with Her
mann. Dalv, after closely scanning the
prisoner, said "He is just the build of
the man ' that was with the other fel
low." He seems to fully realize that he
is, for the time being, at least, under
the . 'AA
PROTECTION OF INSPECTOR BYRNE.
At length the complaint and affidavit
had been prepared and presented, and
the two men and the two women were
called up on the little platform so they
could face Judge Gorman. Daly stood
near them, and within one arm's length
of the man who came so near being his
murderer. The prisoners were then
called upon to answer: Hermann said:
"I decline to answer any question until
after 1 have seen and talked with In
spector Bvrne;" Meredith, as cool as
ever, when* adaressed,"l use to answer
every question," was all he would
say Ella Hammond said she was
thirty years old, did plain sewiug for a
living and was not guilty of the charge.
Adelaide Stanton looked her inter
rogator square in the face while telling
him she was twenty-five years old and
an actress by profession. .. lhe justice
disposed of the four prisoners as stated.
Meredith and the two women were
then taken to the tombs and locked up.
Hermann will remain at police _ head-
Quarters. Adelaide Stanton s real name
is Edgecombe. Her father is Leroy
Edgecombe, a resident of Waverly,
Tioga county, this state. She tele
graphed to her fathtr last night that she
was in trouble, and asked him to
come to her. Mr. Edgecomb is expected
to reach New York to-night. Hermann,
in his confession to Inspector Byrnes,
says he is a hotel butcher.and among oth
er places, has worked at the St. Charles
hotel, New Orleans, and latterly at the
Grand Union hotel, Saratoga. He met
the Himmond woman two years ago on
Sixth avenue, and they had at different
times lived together since as man and
wife. He met Meredith, chief conspir
ator, a couple of weeks before election.
Hermann says that he introduced Mere
dith to the" Stanton woman, and the
quartette went to live at the Fourth av
enue flat where A/A- _„'
THE BADGER GAME WAS ATTEMPTED
upon Daly. Meredith was much
pleased with the Stanton woman. She
would, he said, make a good 'crook,
because she had the "nerve.". He could
make much money with her aid. lhe
Outcome of the matter was that about
Nov. 28 Meredith told Hermann that he
had fixed it all with Addie Stanton for
a big strike and he would give Her
mann $15,000 to take a hand. The
scheme was to write letters to men of
wealth and prominence to entice them
into the flat. Tbe first one who
fell in and was "any good,"
had any reputation or money to
lose • was to be chloroformed and
robbed. They calculated to get about
$30,000 from Daly by threats and black
mail. Hermann was assigned to the
task or tying aud torturing the pris
oner. Daly, one of the chosen victims,
came once and the chance - was allowed
to pass. Meredith reproached Her
mann for the slip. The Hammond
! woman, who was a soitof silent. partner
i in tne scheme, was out of the flat when
j Daly passed through the ordeal, She
i did not wish to be present at the time.
The two men . played cards in the
kitchen, while the Stanton woman
watched for* the gambler. What fol
lowed has already been told.

SPRECKLES' SWEETS SEIZED.
Collector Hager, of San Francisco;
Collars a ' Valuable - Cargo of
Sugar.
San Francisco, Dec. 7.— Collector J.
S. Hager to-day seized the steamer
Westheath and her cargo of sugar,
which arrived here from Java last
Monday; consigned to the '•: Ameri
can .. sugar refinery of this
city. Duty, amounting to 1150,000
was paid on the cargo, which is valued
at 8400.000. The reason for the seizure
is stated to be that the quality of the
sugar has been underestimated and that
the government has been defrauded of
about $100,000 duty on one cargo. A
warehouse of the company where some
of the sugar has been stored was also
seized, and with the steamer and cargo,
placed in charge of the customs officers
under seal. The sugar is supposed to
have been colored in Java, where a very
fine quality of sugar is made, which
coloring gives appearance to the sugar
of being a lower grade of sugar and
subject to a less amount of duty. This
is the largest seizure ever made in the
port, and the first cargo of sugar ever
received from Java. The penalty at
tached, if the charge is proved, is con
fiscation of the cargo "and a fine of 20
per cent of its value.

Temporary Cessation of Hostil
ities at Bevier, the Scene of the
• Labor Riots.
Special to tho Globe. ' • . •
Macon, Mo., Dec. 7.*— Advices to-night
from Bevier, the scene of the labor dis
turbance Wednesday, are to the effect
that all is quiet, and' that the orders of
the sheriff and posse to the contending
forces to keep off tho streets after dark
are being obeyed. Adjt. Gen. Jameson
telegraphed Sheriff Lydia to-day from
Jefferson City that he would arrive in
Revier to-morrow, when the request for
militia would be acted upon. The sher
iff maintains that the cessation of hos
tilities is but temporary, and unless the
-governor acts promptly the disgraceful
scenes of Wednesday night will be re
peated. Nothing but the presence of
militia, he says, will prevent another
outbreak, unless some adjustment of
differences between the mine owners
and the operatives is reached. The
sheriff remained in Bevier to-night,
and, as far as it lies in his power, will
see that peace is maintained. -« . ■:
BOLD BAD BROTHERS.

States Revenue Officer Frank Wooters,
accompanied by Deputy Collector W.
P. Creary, took a posse of seventeen
men to Cedar Creek, Wyoming county,

Payne and his brothers were engaged
in illicit distilling. The still was

approached they were halted. Two of
them were arrested, but William Payne
showed fight and was not arrested until
after some sharp* shooting. John, Wil

SQUEALING ON THE STAND.

Strong "-Case Against Bauerei
sen. . ;'.":*
Geneva, 111., Dec. 7.— The first thing
done in the Burlington conspiracy case
was the introduction of the dynamite
cartridges, and fulminating caps
purchased by Bowles with Bauereisen's
money and under his instructions.
These were all identified by Bowles,
who had resumed the witness stand in
direct examination. The cross-exami
nation was then begun by Dan Donohoe,
of Chicago, and it lasted until the ad
journment of court. This ordeal did
not cause Bowles to contradict himself
in the least as to the main facts in his
testimony, though in several minor de
tails he pleaded forgetfulness. He de
nied very emphatically the charge
sought to be made by the attorney that
he had beer promised immunity by the
railroad company for his testimony.
When court adjourned it was until
Monday at 1 p. m.
He Dabbled in Wheat.

General and Mrs. Boulanger
; Have Decided to Kiss
and Make Up.
Several Incipient Skirmishes
With Slavers on the Coast
of Zanzibar.
London, Dec. 7.—The Suakim mud
dle is still attracting public attention,
and unquestionably giving the govern
ment some uneasiness. Lord Salisbury,
after a long consultation with the mili
tary authorities yesterday afternoon,
hastily betook himself to Windsor last
evening, where he held a prolonged
conference with the queen preparatory
to appearing in the chair at the cabinet
meeting to-day. The question was
thoroughly discussed by the ministers
to-day, and it is thoroughly understood
that the attitude of Lord Randolph
Churchill induced a decided modi
fication of the cabinet's orig
inal plans with regard to the
new scheme of opening an aggress
ive Soudan campaign. Ever since
the springing of Lord Churchill's
motion in the house, public belief has
grown that the government has ac
cepted a tough contract, and it is also
believed that the government has begun
to realize its difficulties. Firmly con
vinced of the gravity of the situation,
the Telegraph has dispatched to Suakim
Bennet Burleigh, who made himself
famous as a correspondent during the
, Soudan campaign, and the Central
News has arranged to send to
THE SCENE OF CONFLICT
Kirby Bright, a young though brilliant
reporter, whose splendid work at home
has given great promise of phenomenal
journalistic achievements abroad. Both
gentlemen leave on the same train to
night, and other newspaper representa
tives will follow within twenty-four
hours. The death of the artist Wake,
of the Graphic, has cast a gloom over
the journalistic fraternity, and at the
same time has stimulated the leading
papers to realization of the necessity of
having an adequate staff of correspond
ents on the ground before movements
are compelled in defense of Suakim,
which may render the penetration of
correspondents to the front impossible.
The news of the death of young
Wake was startling, and proved the
daring and desperation of the Arab be
leaguerers of the principal Red sea port.
The Tories are loth to forgive Lord
Randolph Churchill for his precipitate
onslaught upon the government in the
Suakim matter, and the rumored at
tempt to expel him from the Carlton
clv > has been confirmed. Whatever
trepidation the promoters of this scheme
may have felt was allayed by the direct
cut given to
- THE YOUNG TORY-DEMOCRAT
by Lord Salisbury in passing him in the
house of lords last night, and the smaller
fry, encouraged by the example of their
chief, will not hesitate to resort to any
measure of retaliation available to offset
Lord Randolph's attack and its results.
It is now impossible for the gov
ernment to permit the prq*s
reg i )ii of jariiament until Dec.
21, and ii is pronable that an ad
journment will only be taken until the
first week in January —just long enough
to carry the period of Idleness over the
Christmas holidays. The exigencies of
the present situation seem to demand
this. The proposed amendment in the
house of lords to the land purchase bill,
paying the landlord 4 per cent pending
the completion of the sale and mulcting
the tenant therefor, will raise a storm
in the house of commons, and cause
further delay in the final passage of the
bill.
It is probable that an attack will be
made upon the rebel force at Suakim
on Wednesday next.
CRISIS IN SPAIN.
Several of the Cabinet Ministers
Have Resigned Their Portfolios.
Madrid, Dec. To-night it is an
nounced that several of the cabinet
ministers have resigned. Prime minis
ter Sagasta will have an interview with
the queen regent to-morrow.
The ministerial crisis is due to the
election of eight conservatives and pro
tectionists as membets of the budget
committee. The conservatives hope
with the help of dissident liberals, to
force Premier Sagasta to form a semi
conservative - protectionist ministry.
Gen. van's resignation has been ac
cepted. The ministers of justice,
finance and public works have asked
permission to resign. The budget com
mittee consisted of twenty-one friends
and fou r teen opponents of the govern
ment. Senor Sagasta, conversing with
friends I to-night, said he feared that a
dissolution of parliament would be nec
essary. El Dia believes that all of the
Democratic ministers will retire.

London, Dec. Patrick Molloy,
who was arrested in Dublin for refus
ing to obey a subpcena calling on him
to give -evidence before 7 the Parnell
commission, was examined at to-day's
session of the commission. Attorney
General Webster, of the Times' coun
sel, conducted his examination, which
was very lengthy, but the witness met
all the counsel's questions with blank
denials, and finally Sir Richard was
forced to abandon his examination,
having failed to oxtract the smallest
particle of evidence from Molloy. Mi
chael Davitt then took the witness in
hand. In answer to Mr. Davitt's ques
tion Molloy said that a solicitor's clerk
in Dublin promised him money if he
would testify before the commission and
try and criminate Michael Davitt. Upon
cross-examination by Sir Charles Rus
sell Molloy admitted that he had been
humbugging the Times in giving them
false information for puropose of gain.
At the conclusion ot his examination
Molloy was returned to prison.
