'Nor dto we think it cain inutke any
difference that, inlstead of reporting to
a holding company as was done in the
Northern Securities case, the control
ling interest in the stork of one cor
poration is transferred to the other.
The domination and control, and the
power to sIl,'ppress competition, are ac
tunired in the one case no less than
in tthe other ndl the resulting mIis
chief, at which the statute was aimetd,
is tequlally eff.ective, whichever form is
iadopted."
-He added that a more eifftetual form
of co!llbhinatinn to secure thi, control
of a c'uttlltting rniilod than for one
road to aeqlire :t nldnllnating stickt
interest in the other could hardly he
conceived.
icne by one, Justice J)ay tPok upl
the arguments upon which the rail
rotads happened Ito tdfeat the igovl. rn
nlent's snit. IHe first cunsidered thelt
narglltent that the systetls were not
competitors, hut partners.
"To competet," said the js::tice, "is
to strive for sometthiniog which aloither
actively is seeking Illid I i S)1 Ito
gain."
ItI quohtedt the testimony of railrh;id
leon that this was w\h1:it thie Uni'ton
Pacific andi Suthtern Pacific \ie-re do
ing at the titIne of thle purchase. Coln
lpetition as to rates was not the only
aim of the law\, ihe explained, butl
there was comlllpetition as to the chalr
acter of service rendered, anld :CeOltll
nmodatlions offered. He said that it
ilmadc e Inol difference that rattes were)
not raised 'for the mllle being, after
the combinaltion wts lefTcted. "It is
the scoe of sucI h comlinatitl ,ils and
their ,tpowler lo sulplress an111 stifle
competition or create mnonoipoily which
determines the applilliility of the
net," Justice tiay declared.
The argument that the competitionl
was infinitesimal, he dismissed with
the statlement that it amountedt to
lany ntillions of dollars.
Next he took iup the argtumentt that
the Union Pacific was onIly : connect

"This court reaches the decision
that the Union Pacific and Southern
Pacific systems, prior to the stock
Purchase, were competitors engaged
in interstate commerce, actjng inde
pendently as to a large 'amount of
such carrying trade and that since the
acquisition of the stock in question
the dominating power of the Union
Pacific has suppressed competition
between the systems and has ef
fected a combination in restraint of
interstate commerce within the pro
hibitions of the act.
"In order to enforce the state, the
court is required to forbid the doing
of the future acts like those which are
found to have been .one in violation'
thereof and to enter a decree which
will effectually dissolve .the combina
tion found to exist in violation of the
statute.
"The decree should provide an in
junction against the right to vote this
stock while in the ownership or con
trol of the Union Pacific company or
any corporation owned by it, or while
held by any corporation or persons
for the Union Pacific company and
forbid any transfer or disposition
thereof in. such wise as to continue
its control and should provide an in
junction against the payment of div
idends upon such stocks while thus
held, except to a receiver to be ap
pointed by the court which shall col
lect and hold such dividends until dis
posed of by the decree of the court.
As the court below dismissed the
governmlcent's bill, it was necessary to
consider the disposition of the shares
of sticl acquired by the Union Pa
cific company, which acquisition, we
ihold, constituted an unlawful ombina
tion in violation of the anti-trust act.
'L'o effectually conclude the operating
force of the comllbination such dispo
sition should be made subject to the
approval and decree of the court and
any plan for the disposition of this
stock must be such as to effectually
dissolve the unlawful combination thus
created. The court shall proceed, up
on the presentation of any plan, to
hear the goverlnment anoi defendants
and may bring in any additional par
ties whose presence may be necessary
to a final division of the stock in con
fortuity to the views herein ex
pressed.
"As to the suggestion made at the
tral argumenllllt the attorney gen
eral as to the nature of the decree,
that altone must be entered, which,
while destroying the unlawful combi
nation insllofr as the Union Pacific se
cured control of the clompecting line of
road extending from New Orleans and
t(alve iton to San Francisco and Port
land, would permit the Union Pacife
lto retain the 'entral Pacific connec
htijn fromllll ()gl'n to San Francisco
and thereby to control that line to the
coast, thus effecting such a. contin
uity oif the tlin lPacific' and ('entral
Pacific fro tlih Missouri river to
San l'riniscio als was colntcnmplated by
the acts of coi.griss undel' which they
;;were contstruted, it should be seen that
nothing herein.i shall be considered as
prevent ig the governlellt or any
paerty ill interst, if so desiring, from
presenting to the court a plan for ac
complishing this result or preventing
the court tr'ui adolting any such plan
soi presented.
"Any plan or plans shall be pre
sented to the court within three
months fromn the receiplt of the man
idate of this court, failing which, or
upon tic, rej'etiton by the court of
ilans submiitted within such time, the
court sh:all Ir iiciied by receivership
Iand salet it necessary to dispose of
such stock in such wise as to dissolve
sucoh unlawful combllination.
"The government has appealed from
the decree, which is a general one,
dismissing the bill. So far as con
Scerns the attempt to acquire the
Northern Pacific stock and the stock
of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe
Railway companylillty, afterward taban
doned, and a cecrtain interest in the
San Pedro, I,,'s Angeles & Salt Lake
Railroad cinlliltpany and other features
of the cast dealt with and disposed
of by the decrlee and opinion of the
.onuirt below, it is sufficient, without
going into those matters in detail, to
say as to themt, we find no reason to
disturb the action of the court below,
ibut for the reasons stated, the decree
shall be reversed and one entered in
conformity to the views herein ex

nmnt at par and interest in Central
Pacific should it be' taken over by
Ution Pacific as intimated by the
United States supreme court's de
cirlcn.
Southern Pacific owns ail the com
man stock of Central Phaific, in con
s:de-ration of which the Southern Pa
cific issued an eaual as sunt of col
lateral 4's.
While the Harriman stocks were
falling, the remainder of the' list
made one or two-poit, declines, but
the unsettlethent Wa*w little more than
temporary, most issues covering the
greater part of their lose befote the
lull cloao. United States Steel was
a conspicuous exception showing more
heaviness than any other leader.
The manner in which the 'seeri-.
ties of the union Pacific and Southern
Pacific roads may be readjusted will
call for a greater degree of legal
skill than was entailed in the dissolu
tion resulting from the Northern Se
curities decision. Union Pacific owns
virtually half, perhaps a little more,
oc Southern Pacific, and the latter
owns outright by stock ownership all
of Central Pacific, which is the
Union Pacific's link between Ogden
and the Pacific coast,
Bankers interested in the Harriman
properties and other financiers identi
fied with important railroad systems
,were inclined to regard the supreme
court decree as a logical outcome of
tlhe. Northern securities decision.
These same interests point to the
Standard Oil and American tobacco
cases, however, as indicating that
"segregation" of the Harriman lines
need work no harm to holders of the
securities involved.

lican senators to bring about the, elec
tion of Senator Gallinger.
The house will assemble at noon to
morrow. Roll call in the two houses

There are vacancies in each branch.
Plans for the first day's session had
been laid out by Speaker Clark and his
ptirliamentary clerk, Charles H. Crisp,
early in the day. They provided a call
of the roll by states as soon as thb
chaplain, Rev. Charles N. Couden, had
offered prayer.
Resolutions had been prepared in
each house for the appointment of the
joint committee to notify President
Taft that congress had convened and
was ready to receive any messages.
Further resolutions provided for com
mittees from each house to notify the
other that a quorum had been secured.
Great animation was shown at both
ends of the capitol as the hour for re
convening drew near. 'speaker Clark
was besieged by returning members
and held a number of informal con
ferences, some of therm with senators
%\ho came to disc,(ls plans for co

Chairman Ind 'rwood alsis was a I
center of attraction and with other
members of the ways and means com
mittee held a short conference with
the speaker. Representative Payne
and the minority republicans of the
ways and mrans committee also paid
visits of compliment to the speaker.
The senate end of the capitol was

opening proceedings.
It w\as not quite 12 o'clock when 4
Senator Bacon, president pro temnpore, t
took the chair at the desk of the late
Vice President Sherman and rapped
for order in the senate. Senators
surged through the doors at the last
momlllent and it took some time to se
cure orde.r for the prayer by. the chap
lain, Rev. U. G. B. Pierce.
Failure of members of the house to
reach the floor delayed the opening of
the session of the house about a min
ute *after the hour of noon. \Vhen
Speaker ('lark climbed the stairs to
the rostrunl he was greeted by ap
plause and cheers from the floor and
cr, owded galleries.
W\\hen thI: prayer was concluded a
burst of applause greeted Representa
tive William Sulzer, governor-elect of
New York, as he took his seat.
The roll call ,by states followed.
\\hen the. name of former Speaker
Cannon was called the members rose
and applauded and cheered the vet
eran legislator, whose services at this
session will conclude 40 years in the
halls of congress.
"Uncle Joe" rose in his place and
howed his ackunowledgements" of the
greeting.

ary resolution to appoint members of
a joint committee to notify the pres
ident that congress had assemble.d,
ISenator Lodge mnoved that the sen
