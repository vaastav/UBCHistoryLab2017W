Relief and Core
Tbe Immediate use of Aycr's Cherry
Pectoral, In tho earlier stages of throat and
lung diseases, la highly Important. Every
hour's delay Is dangerous, aud may prove
fatal. E. O. Reynolds, druggist, Dlxfield,
JTo., writes : "Aycr's Cherry Pectoral Is a
wonderful remedy. In the fall of 1875 I
was taken with a sudden Cold, oceomps
nled with a terrible Cough. I suffered for
three months, grew worse all the time, and
was threatened with Consumption.
AYER'S
Cherry Pectoral
was recommended to me by a neighbor,
and bad a favorable effect at once. I con
tlnued Its use until five or six bottles had
been taken, when I was completely
cured." Dr. Chambers S. Penn, Harden,
Scioto Co., Ohio, write t "Sly wife wst
afflicted with a violent Cough, accon
panted with Bleeding. Remedies usually
prescribed In such cases failing, I resolved
to try Ayer's Cherry Pectoral, which, I
am satisfied, saved her from Pulmonary
Consumption."

The Labor Question Our Record oil
tho Subject.
While as yet we have mailo no Bye
tematio advocacy as an editor of tbe
various Labor movements, nor become
a member of any of their organiza
tions, tho tone of our editorial col
timns can have loft no one in doubt
as to onr sympathies with those
movements. From onr earliest years
of reflection our strong natural demo
cratio (we do not use the word in
pnrtisun sense) impulses and convio
tions, re-enforced by the teachings of
the New Testament, irresistibly ira
polled us in the direction indicator
We are no lattor-day convert to the
cause of the emancipation and Nova
tion of Labor, but a life-time disciple.
In proof we need only adduce the
following stanzas from an effusion
mainly written during our "teons."
Though so long a time has elapsed
since it was first penned, it will be
noticed that it is strikingly pertinent
to the present hour. And we may
add that our early convictions on
this subject have deepened with tbe
lapse of years.
LABOR : ITS BANK AND RIGHTS.
Passages from a poem of twenty-seven
stanzas, written niniuly in the year 1840,
While strive the votaries of worldly ears,
Diverse In ststlon, but silks In woo;
Wnether the human worm be Plenty's heir,
Or, herding with the swine, and grov'llng low,
Subsist on what his fellow worms bestow;
While foul Oppression wsstea this earthly ball,
Andtho roused People, rushing to and fro.
For vengeance on their brutal tyrants call,
I sing the stalwart Pow'r the viollm-lord of all
Let angry factions at each other rail,
And demagogues pollute fair Freedom's shrine,
The humble tenant of the rural malt
Heeds notreproaob, lu virtue's csuse divine;
What thongh uuknowu, unhonor'd la his llnet
(nigh heaven disclaims distinctions weak and vain,)
The stars that on Columbia's banner shine,
Attest the virtues of the runtio train.
Whose honest toil end worth their lustre still ens
tain.
Then let It not be said onrmalohless land '
la recreant 1 Labor's slighted cause,
That her free sous, with weak and nerveless hand'
Shrink basely thui from God and nature's laws:
Ho; honest Labor has a pow'r which draws ,
The homage of each high and generous mind;
A calm, a holy majesty which awea.
More than the empty pageautry designed
To win the gaie of fools to tyrants of mauklnd.
How glorious Is his train In ev'ry age I
How noble are their golngs-forth on earth I
Who shine the brightest on tbe historic page
For mighty energy and matchless wurth 1
The sons of Labor from creation's birth
Their names are first on Hmor'ssacrsd scroll;
Nobly they stand, amid the general dearth
01 useful arta, and dignity of soul,
Which else had spread uncheck'd, from distant
pole to pole.
To delve the mine, to (urn Hie slnhborn soil,
To rear tbe dome, to ply each manly art,
To prompt tbe hardy navigator's toll,
To guide bis course with compass and with chart;
To form the soul that firmly walks apart,
In cobverse with its own Immortal powers,
'To raise tbe genlns and to mend the heart,'
Theso are the pastimes of stern Labor's honrs.
Dispensing Health and Joy, like Summer dews sod
ahowr'a.
Yes, ev'ry bliss luxurious Plenty shares.
la wrung from honest Labor's hardy band;
He, nobly, ev'ry pain and danger dares.
To guard the welfare of his native land;
Meantime, complacent Pride bolda high oomroand.
And spurns him from bis presence with disdain
Brauds with repioach the self-denying band,
Who all his high o'erweenlng state suataln
As only flt to toll, his graudeur te maintain.
Thus, Heav'n's behest, alike enjolo'd on all,
Alike easentitl to tbe common good,
Is wrested by Oppression's hateful thrall
To nourish up a bate and worthless brood.
On others' toils, and groana, and tears of blood;
Thus huts slid palaces, commingling, ris,
Aod thus, while aisrvlng millions beg for food,
Accursed Greed, unmindful or th?(r cries
With glaring, waslalul pomp Insults lb' avenging

TOM'S SOPHOMORE YEAR.'
BT CBABLXS STBWART.
Tom stood In tho middle of tbe room with
bis hands in bis pockets, and wbisUiug soft
ly, looking about him.
It was a plrtiu little room just untlor the
roof, but it bad been Tom's room evor
since be bad bad one of bis own, sud be
was attached to it
But iu a day or two, so he was saying to
himself, be was to leave It lor nearly year.
There, noar the head of the bod, stood bis
trunk a funny old trunk that had bclono-
ed to his grandfather, aud was oovored with
hairy bide fantenoxl wltn brass nails.
He had Just bean paaklug it, and a glance
at its contents told where he was going to
spend the ooiniiitj year.
For besidos bis olothing might bo seen
green oovored Ittiu aud iirook gmuiuiarn.
leathern-bound lexioous, an algebra, ro
ometry, a copy of Llvy, and several other
books wbiolt spoKe or a oonoge oourso. -For
three davs later, at bis oollece iu
oountry town, more than a hundred utiles
away, Tom Sargent inteudod to make his
first appearance as a learned Sophomore.
'Just to thiukt" ho said to himself. 'It's
only three days now, and then I'll see all
the follows, won't we nave some pow
wows? Aud wou't we dig into the old clas
sics and mathomatics?" and he enve a boy
ish shuffle on the floor to give vent to his
delight.
Just thon he heard a step below his win
dow, and looking out, be saw bis father en-
toring tho yard on foot
'Whv.father!"ortedTom suddenly. "JJld
you walk all the way home?"
"Yes."
"Why. whore's Topxy?"
Topsy was Mr. Sargent's little black horse
that he had bail for years, and now that he
was getting old, und growing heavier and
more bulky as age crept on, ne naa aone
but little walking in his businoss about
town, but made Topsy his invariable com
nauion.
"Wuores lopsy, iainerr OBsoa xom
...... m a. i . , rr
ncram.
"Well, Tom." said his -father, laying
down his knife aud fork, "I suppose I've
sold Topsy."
"Sold TopByi" erica Tom. "uia you
know It, mother?"
But his mother's face was answor enough.
"Why. what for, father?" Tom continued
Sold Topsy! And the new buggy you
boncht hist year, to make your driving
oasv: have you sold that, too?"
"Yes, I've practically sold them both.
The bargain isn't really closed, but Joe Wat
son has taken thein to try to-day, and if his
offer's fair, I Bhall take it."
"Whv. father." said Torn, in a remon
strating tone, as be brushed baik bis stiff
hair. "Why, your business seeps you
travolinc between your shop and the folks
that work for you, all the time. You oan't
walk that much."
"I must cut down expenses," said Mr,
Sargent. "I'vo run behind this year.
There's no other way."
Nothing more was said.
After dinner Tom went up to bis room
Azato. and sat down on a oorner or tnc
trunk.
Tonsv sold! And the bngtry soldi It did
not seem possible And to think of his
father, far from being vigorous now, yet
forced to plod about oontinuully over the
rough roads.
The backs of tbe grammars ana lexicons,
smiling np at him from the trunk, made
bini uncomfortable
He rose, and shut down tbe cover of the
trunk, and stood for a loug time with his
hands iu his pockets, looking out of the
wiudow.
Thero was a vorv pretty landscape of
green pastures and woodland outside, but
Tom saw nothing of it. tits eyes seemca
to be fixed on somo far-away placo beyond
the horizon .
After a while he turned aud began to
pace the room. Then he paused by his
trunk, and opened it aguin, and looked in.
What pleasant suggestions it offered, what
promises it held outl
The room was small and plain, and Tom
was by no means a good looking boy. Bnt
such boys are sometimes the heroes, aud
such rooms tho battle grounds of oontests
which make no noise in the world, .and
which yet doruand as much pluck and char
acter in the victor, as bas many a famous
coutest for a kingdom and a crown.
Tom continued bis walking to and fro in
the little room, whistling now and thon.and
from time to time, throwing himself into a
chair restlessly.
The afternoon wore away. The sun
dropped till it seemed to rest an instant on
peak which Tom could boo irom tns win
dow, and then the room suddenly grew

The change seemed to ronne Tom to a
decision. Ho pnt on his bat and a moment

town.
The next morning, when brenkfaftt was
ready, Tom was not on band. Bnt just as
his father and mother were beginniug to
wonder where be could b, what rhonld
they see bnt Tom, driving Topsy up to the
door, and bitching her to the post.
'Tom," said bis father, as be earns in,
what does this moan?"
It moans you're going to keep Topsy,

"Father, I've thought it all over, and I've
decided not to go back to college this year,

horse and buggy, and I'll lay np what I

A BALE OF COTTON
An ArTVcling Sketch From Ileal Life.
We copied the followlug last summer,
but feol that we ooniiot do better than re
publish it, now that It is even mora "in sea
sou," It breathes tbe "still, small voice"
of truth and conviction as to the mounter
vi! of onr times more impressively than
many mora pretentions efforts. Ed. Fbkb
rants
He Lad worked hard all summer.
He had plowed and hoed through
rain and sun, and now in the fall bad
gathered ono bale of cotton, with
which he wns to etnrt to market next
rooming. The family were assembled
around tho tiro. Thejired, care worn
wife looked a little more cheerful
th.m nsual ; the two little boys,
Frank and Tommy, ten and twelve
yenrs old, who had each been prom
ised a dollar, to "flpond just as they
pleased," were planning bow tbey
wcnld spend tbe money. Little
Mnggio, who had been promised A
nevy, doll, with real hair, was arrang
ing tho scraps of calico out of wbicb
she dosignod making dollie's new
drefises.
"Mother, what do you waoli" Baid
the husband. "I can (ret along with
my old clothes, John t bnt you have
to be in the cold bo much you bad
bettor got you a pair of good boots,
some warm stuff for me to mako you
a pair of trousers and a coat Frank
will need some shoes and a pair of
trousers: Tommie wants a coat, I
can make him some trousors out of
your old ones. Get some dark calico
for a dress lor the baby, aud somo
flannel to nutko him a pottiooat.
Maggie needs some shoes and a drosB
and some aprons, and you bad better
got a dollurs worth of quinine
"Yos, then 1 11 get a barrel of Hour,
live gallons of molasses, two dollars
worth of sugar, and tho same in cor
foe. That will take about all the
money I will get Tor the bale of cot
ton ; so you will not got a thing, Bet-
tie.
"I don't need anvtbing, John
can turn my last year's dross and
beBidos, the weather will bo cokl and
I'll not go out niach." And she kiss
ed her sleeping bubo, while a tear
trickled down bor face. In ber un
selfishness she hud arranged to pro
vide for all the family except herself.
She did not tell her husband that her
bIiocb were worn through the sole,
and that the dress she proposed to
turn bad boon turned before.
Next morning John and his two
boys were seatod on the bale of cot
ton and on their way to town by day
light. Papa was iu n fine humor, and
the little boys were in high glee in
anticipation of the good time thoy
were to have and tho nice things they
were to buy with their dollar. About
noon the wagon drove np to a ware
bouse, where the cotton was sold, tho
team was unhitched and fed, and the
boys loft to "watch tho things" while
papa went to the bank to get tbe
chock cashed. The check was paid
and John put the money in bis
pocket, and bad started back to his
wagon, when he met a friend, () who
said : "John, let's go and get a
drink." After they hud drank at tho
friend's expense, John ordered the
"drinks :" then another friend camo
in aud they drank again and again.
By this time John was pretty drunk.
He eat down by the stove to sober up
before ho went back to where he had
left bis little boys, preparatory to
making bis purchases. But the ef
fects of the warm fire soon putting
him to sleep, bo forgot bis hard sum
mer's work; ho forgot bis tired wife
at home; he furgot bis two little boys,
shivering in the cold ; hp forgot his
manhood as bo sat for hours in a
drunken stupor. When he awoke it
was night! He staggered np and out
in the darkness when be remember
ed bis money. Putting his hand into
his pocket, be fonnd it was gone!
Half dazod with drink and a senso of
loss, ho went to his wagon. The
mules wore asleep on their feet; the
little boys had .wrapped themselves
in an old quilt and were asleep under
the wagon.
John hitched np the mule, woke np
the boys and told them to get in;
then ho started homeward. Tbe lit
tle cnes knew by the wicked oaths
their father swore at the mules that
he was drnnk. So they netlod to
gether, and during the long weary
nuts uutue tucr ucvur uuro nuu.

The rreslilpnt'a Second Annual Vessare.
The present message, as compared with
its predecessor, has oue strikiug distinction
In iu tone of eympathetio response to tbe
moat urgent of the political exlgenolcs of
the hour. On tbe subjeot of excessive rev.
enua and unnecessary taxation ths president
enlarges aud elaborates in a manner denot
ing that he is deeply impressed with tbe in
tolerable nature of a great and constantly
increasing evil. It is an evil of such mon
strous potouey as to make a cruel mockery
even of s positive administrative virtue. As
the president shows, the very economy
which a reform administration has Infused
into otdlootion of taxes Is made to aggravate
ths curse of a vast accumulation of idle
treasure and a oeaseless drain ot the cur
rency rosouroes of the people. He point
to the only just and adequate remedy. It
is to roliuve tbe people of a needless burden
and get rid of a useless and barren surplus
by cutting down unnecessary taxation,
wbioh is iu the esseuno of extortion and '
robbery, to the actual needs of eoonomloal
government maintained for the comprehen
sive purpose of protecting the oitisen in the
5 reotest liberty oonsitteut with tbe good or
er of society, and in perfect security for tbe
enjoyment of bis earnings, with the least
possible deduction for publio requirements.
The alternative is to continue to pile np tho
hoard, and continue to force and enlarge tho
drain, or to plunge Into a sea of wasteful,
corrupting and demoralising extravagance.
Politics would reek with oonspiraoles for
publio plunder aud the halls of Congress be
resolve! into unmitigated aens or jobbery.
The presideut does not exaggerate the olaims
of the mass of worklngmen aud the mass of
farmers and agriculturists to a large measure
of legislative consideration for their inter,
ests with roBpeot to taxes, direct oriudirejt,
affecting the pi ice whloh they pay for the
necessaries of life. He could have spared
himself a good doal of labor or disquisition
by lumping together tbe workingman, tho
farmer, tbe agriculturist, and the honest,
industrious oitizen of every vocation and ev
ory oondition, and defining their relation to
taxation as that of the average consumer.
This Is the forgotten man lu the system of
class legislation and legalised spoliation.
When bis interests are rightly considered
and effectively guarded, justice will be dona
to all elasses-rnot before. On tbe subject
of civil servioe roform the president's voles
is not nnceitnin. In decided terms he in
sists on carrying out tbe civil servioe act to
he full logical extent of the principle which
it embodies. He does not mistake when ha
holds the destiny of ths republio to be In
volved in the filial maintenance of this prin
ciple. ' Tbe spoils system which so long
made the president a murky fountain of
patronago, congressmen first of all and last
of all office-brokers, and politicians like so
many howling wolves, "whose gospel is'
thoir maw," must go root and branch, or
tbe duration of the republio con not be as
sured. Oivil-servioe reform is a vital neces
sity, because political service reform is a vi
tal necassity, ana tne latter can not oe naa
without the forrow,
TCaTTJBES 0 THB MBSSAOl.f ; '
Tho president's message, to Congress
shows that no foreign relations exist to en
danger peaoe. The administration did not
abandon the position which was taken when
Mr. Cutting was imprisoned in Mexico, and
can never admit a foreign government to
have jurisdiction over offeuses consummated
in the United States. It favors maintaining
Hawaii as independent of any European
government. Congress is recommended to
ths reciprocity treaty with "Mexico. Tbfl
administration also proposes to make a new
treaty of commerce and navigation with
Mexit'O, Tbe president hopes to finish ne
gotiations about the Canadian fisheries and
lay the history of the case before Congress
during the sexsiou. He recommends inter
national copyright, and the free admission
of foreign works of art. Tho message shows
tbat imports have inoreased during the year,
aud tbe treasury surplus is increasing in
nuiontit, and speaks strongly or tne Injus
tice of thus taxing the people when tho
money is not needed for any proper pur
pose, in alluding to silvor coinage ins
president's message goes upon the theory
that such ooinage was designed to enhance)
the value of silver bullion and has foiled to
do so. The large number of suits growing
out of obscure aud complicated tariff laws
furuish a pica for sjrae enactments to make
tbe laws more distinct In meaning, ine
general reorganization of tbe federal courto
is recommended, with additional judges to
get through tho woik of courts now crowd
ed with business. Fortifications for impor
tant coast cities (not named) and tbe build
ing of war ships are urged, with a prefer
ence for domestic construction. Liberal
payments, approaching to subsidy' of Amer
ican steamniiips for carrying ths mails to
South America sre advocated as a means of
extending our export trade. Tbe message
favors building federal penitentiaries and
their management so as not to employ oon
vict labor iu distasteful competition with
free labor. It is recommended tbat tbe In
dians be given land in individual ownership
and brought into citizenship with the rest of
the people. Congress is advised to repeal
the pre-emption, timber culture and deaert
land laws, and make tbe homestead law
more strict. A paragraph feelingly bespeaks
tbe demand for a comprehensive but strict
pension law, nndur which disabled soldiers
m y claim relief as a right. Tbe regulation
of interstate railroads is recommended, as
also provision for arbitration la labor .trou
bles. The president el presses his eouft.
dence that the efforts made to purify the
civil service sre having a good effect. Gal.
