INSURANCE WRONGS.
It is very evident that many of the in
surance companies doing business in
this state have been doing it on the foot

get from the insured in the way of big
annual premiums and when a fire oc

what may be termed an alarming degree, j

it was guarded with extreme vigilance
until the last moment that it was pos

spect to its length and in every other
particular it conld not differ more with

while it contains some information
whichteroncldtetb, avenge dcw*.
per reader it is as barren of recommen-1 *
dations which should distinguish the I
statesman as though no great national
Issues were pending. It te a plea ol
that might have been expressed in a
single sentence and with mach better
effect. To the great question of the tariff
he devotes but little space and that with
fear and trembling when he leaves the
realm of free tobacco and free whisky,
He is as silent as the tomb upon the
wrongs which the present tariff inflicts
upon the toiling masses of the East; the
poverty, degradation and crime which it
eatailqjthat a few may live in splendor
and bask in the sunshine of luxury.
While he recommends a revision of the
tariff, he hedges the recommendation
with every expression that a total disre
gard of the welfare and rights of the
masses can suggest and there leaves the
theme with the seal of his own weakness
and insincerity.
The Pan-American congress receives
his attention, but he seems to realize
that the present tariff is an insurmount
able barrier to an extension of commer
cial relations and he therefore limits the
topic to international comity.
He is opposed to the free coinage of
silver, bat offers no argument to prove

What Prospectors Are Doing In
Developing New Districts
Tributary to Butte.
o>
An Exhaustive Article On The
Fire Clay Mines of
Thompson Falls.
From Wednesday Daily.
Not only are there millions of tons of
silver, gold and copper-bearing ore within
the city limits of Butte, hot there are
also millions of tons within a radius of
from fifteen to fifty milee of this city,
nearly a I of which ie brought to the emel
tere here for reduction.
Only a fe* years ago the quarts ledges of
Butte were the center of attraction for
prospectors, few of them caring to go out
into tbe mountains to seek hidden wealth,
because of the lack of facilities for getting
the or# to a mark t. A great many of
them prospected for gold only, not wanting
to bother with copper or silver, and as a
result good prospects laid dormant for
years, until works for reducing ores were
erected here. Then some mining for quart z
was done at various pointe within fifty
miles of Bntte and tbe ore hauled here by
bull teams for treatment. After the first

and
bull teams for treatment. After the first
railroad began to build its line towards
the city, ÿurospectore commenced to scatter
out in all directions to search for copper
and silver as well as gold, knowing full well
that only a short time would elapse before
a good prospect would be worth money
even though it were a few miles from butte.
The result of thie promiscuous prospecting
ie now patent to everybody in Montana,
but more eepecially to those in this part
of it. Mining districts are to be found in
all directions from Butte—north, south,
east and west, forming one vast halo of
mineral with this city as its center. New
discoveries are beiDg made every
day, and tbe magnetic influence of Butte
capital is the power which is bringing them
into prominence.
About seventeen miles northwest of
Butte tbe Oro Fino district can be found
with its scores of prospects, nearly all of
which are beiDg developed by Butte capital
and brains. Several large amounts of ore,
and the district being tributary to Butte,
most of its production will be of benefit to
this city.
The district, which will in a short time
become what might properly be called a
part of Butte, is that immediately east of
the city, ia what is known as Park canyon
and its surroundings. At present not a

THE UXORCIDE ARRAIGXBD.
Enters a Plea of Not Guilty and Examlm
tlon is Set for Friday.
Joseph Barriere, who murdered his wil
on East Galena street Saturday mornioi
was arraigned belore Judge Newkirk ye;
terday morning on a charge of murder i
the first degree. He was represented b
his attorneys, McBride & Haldorn, ani
entered a plea of not guilty and was n
manded. His examination was set fo
next Friday. Of course it is onl
surmise, but indications warrant th
belief that the "pinkie" elemen
will do everything in its power to securi
the murderer's release, and no end of man
ufactured evidence will be produc d at thi
preliminary hearing in support of Brrri

which the murder was committed, man

he had murdered the woman. From the

Jerome Caldwell Sues the Hutte Stree
Railway Company.
Jerome Caldwell, a citizen of Butte, Iw
instituted suit to recover S25 000ditm
ages from the Butte Street Railway com
pany. Caldwell, in his complaint, alleges
that on the Fourth day of July last, while
coming as a passenger on one of the com
pany's cars from Columbia garden t i the
city, he was run into by another car and
received injuries that will disable him for
life. Tbe accident occurred near the race
track and resulted in plaintiff having his
leg broken. The accident, he says, »as
caused by "the gross carelessness, default
and neg igence of defendant, its servants
and agents, and without any fault or negli
gence on the uart of himself." Caldwell
avers that he sustained a double fracture
of the left leg, and in the languageof the pe
tition states that he "was otherwisegreatly
bruised, wounded and cut, so that he wus
unable to work, has since been confined in
a hospital and is now unable to attend to
or perform the duties of hii business." For
this he asks the comnany to contribute
$25,000 of its means as indemnity for its
alleged carelessness.
Charles O'Donnell has been retained as
counsel by Caldwell, while the company
will be represented by McBride & Ha'.durn.
