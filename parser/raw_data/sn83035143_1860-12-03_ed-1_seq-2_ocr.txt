would be eminently right and proper for ifr.
Lincoln, should he see fit to do to, to inTite
Mr. Clay to be oae of his adviser. The
more so, because Mr. Clay is a ciliren of the
South, and it is but right and just for the
President to select men from that section
whose views, so far as the principles of the
Republican party are concerned, are iu .uni

The appointment of Mr. Clay to a st in

Special to the Cincinnati Commercial.
The message will be'readon Taesdy. Tbt
first draft has been modified, to prevent a eplii
u cabinet. The President is against tberi'u
of secession, snd declares revenoes shall be
eollected. The modification of the Measure
does not affect the principle involved, but tb
phraseology lets Cobb and Ttompson dowi.
easilv. it is said they will not resign, oe-
cause it would intensity the secession feeling
South. But they will quietly withdraw from
active participation in the administration.
It :i Asserted that resolutions will be precipi
tatod upon the tioue after the message is rend
declaring the right of secession. This will
open the fight at once- Republicans propose
to remain in "masterly inactivity," aud per
mil the border States to tight it out with the
cotton State. Members from au the border
States and Louisiana are said to counsel thin
policy, end- manifest a willingness ta stand
