PLAN 'OH RECONSTRUCTION.
Looktog now to the piesent and future,
and with reference to resumption of the
national authority within the states where-
In that authority has been suspended, I
bave thought fit to itsue a proclamation
copy of which is herewith transmitted
In examination of this proclamation, it
" will appear, as is believed, that nothing
is attempted beyond what is amply justi
fied by the constitution. True, the form
of an oath is given, but no man is coerc
ed to take it. The men is only promised
a pardon in case he voluntarily takes the
oatb. The constitution authorizes the
executive to grant or withhold the par
don at his own absolute discretion, and
this includes the power to grant on terms
as is fully established by judicial and oth
er authorities. It is also proffered that,
if in any of the states named a slate gov
ernmcnt shall be in the im.de prescribed
"set up, such government shall bo reco(
tiiztd and guaranteed by the United
State:, and that under it the af.ite shall,
on the constitutional condition!!, be pro.
tecled against invasion and domestic vio
lei.ee. The constitutional, obligation of
the United States to guarantee to every
state in the Union a republican form of
government, and to protect the state in
the cases staled, is e xplicit and full.
And why tender the benefits of this
provision only to a state government set
up in this particular way ? This section
of the constitution contemplates a case
wberein the element williin a Mute fa
vorable to republican government in the
Union may be too feeble for an opposite
and hostile element, external to or even
within the stale ; and such are precisely
Ibe case with which we are now dealing.
An attempt to guarantee and protect a
revived state government, constructed in
whole or in preponderating part from the
very element against whose hostility arid
violence it is to be protected, is simply
absurd. .There must be a test by which
to separate the opposing elements, so as
to build only from those that are sound.
and that test is a sufficiently liberal one
which accepts ns sound whoever will
make a sworn recantation of his former
unsoundness. But if it be proper to re
quire as a test of admission to the politi
cal body an oath ol allegiance to the con
stitution of the United States, and to the
Union under it, why not also to (be laws
and proclamations in regard lo slavery ?
Those laws and proclamations were en
abled and put forth for the purpose of j
aiding in the suppression of the rebel
lion. To give them their fullest effect,
there Lad to be a pledge for their main
tenance. In my judgment, llicy liavr
aided and will further aid the cause for
which they were intended. To now
abandon them would be not only to re.
linquisb a lever of power, but would al
to be a cruel and attounding breach of
fuiih. I may add, at this point, that
wune i remain in my present position l
shall not attempt to retract or modify the
emancipation proclamation, nor shall I
return to slavery any person who is free
by the terms of that proclamation or by
any of Ihe.acts of Congress. For these
and other reasons, it is thought best that
support of these measures shall be inclu
ded in the oath, and it is believed the ex
ecutive may lawfully claim it in return
for pardon fend the restoration of forfeited
rights which he has clear constitutional
power to withhold altogether, or gram
upon the terms be shall deem wisest for
the public interest. It should be obser-
vea, aiso, mat tins part ot me oatli is
subject to the modifying and abrogatin
power of lejjislalion and supreme judicial
decision. The proposed acquiescence of
the national executive in any reasonable
temporary state arrangement for the
freed people is mailt) with the view ol
possibly modifying the confusion and des
titution, which must at best attend all
classes, by a total revolution of labor
throughout ti e whole of these states. Ii
j hoped that the already deeply afflicted
people in those states may be somewhat
more ready to give up tin; cause of their
affliction if, to this extent, this vital mat
ter be left to themselves, while no power
of the national executive, to prevent an
abuse, is abridged by the proposition.
The supposition in the proclamation as
to maintaining (he political framework of
the States, on what is called reconstruc
tion, is made in the hope thai it may do
good wuliout any danger of harm. It
Will save labor and avoid great confu
ion. Cut why any proclamation now
open this subject? This question is be
set with the conflicting views that the
step might be delayed loo long or be ta
ken too toon. - In some stales the ele
ments for resumption seem ready for ac
tion, but remain inactive, apparently for
the want of a rallying point or a plan ol
action, for why shall A adopt the plan of
B rather than B that of A? and if A
and B should agree, how ran they know
but that the general government here
will reject their plan ? By the proclam
ation, a plan is presented which may be
accepted by them as a rallying point, and
which they are assured in advance will
Dot be rejected here. This may bring
tbem to act sooner than they otherwise
would. ' The objections to a premature
presentation of a plan by the national
executive consist in the danger of com
mittals on points which could be more
safely left to future developments. Care
has been taken to so shape the document
as to avoid embarrassments from this
source. Saying that, on certain terms,
certain classes will be pardoned, with
rights restored, it is not said that other
classes or other terms will never be in
cluded j and saying also that reconstruc
tion will be accepted if presented in a
specified way, it is not said it will never
be accepted in any other way. The
movements by state action for emanci
pation in several of the State?, not inclu
ded in the emancipation proclamation,
are matters of profound graluhilion, and,
while I do not repeat in detail what I
have heretofore so earnestly urged upon
this subject, my general views and feel
ings remain unchanged, and I trust Con
gress will omit no fair opportunity of aid
ing these important steps to the great
consummation.
IMl'ORTANCK OK TUB. WAR POWEIl.
In the midst of other cares, however
imporlaut, we must not lose, sight of the
fact that the war power is still our main
reliance, and to that power alone can we
look yet for a time, to give confidence to
the people in the contested regions that
the insurgent power will not again over
run them. Until that confidence shall
be established, little can he done any-
wheie for whut is called reconstruction.
Hence our cbicfest care must still be di
rected to the nrmy and navy, who have
thus far borne their harder parts so nobly
and well. Ami it may be esteemed for
tunate that in giving the greatest efficien
cy to these indi-pensable arms, we do al
so honorably recognize the gallant men,
from commander to sentinel, who com
pose them, and to whom, more than lo
others, the world must stand indebted for
the homo of freedom, disenthralled, re
juvenated, enlarged and perpetuated.

Proclamation.
Whereas, by the Constitution of the
United Slates, it is provided that the pre
sident shall have power lo grant reprieves
and paidons for offences against the Uni
ted Stales, except in cases ol impeach
ment ; and whereas, a rebellion now ex
ists whereby the loyal state governments
of the several slates have for a long lime
been subvened, and many persons have
committed and are now guilty of treason
against the United States ; and whereas,
with reference to said rebellion and trea
son, laws have been enacted by Congress
declaring the forfeitures and confiscation
of properly and the liberation of slaves,
all upon terms anil condition therein
itntttU, and ulaa tlwuli.viuti ttmt the tiru'i-
dent was thereby authorized at any time
thereafter by proclamation to extend lo
persons who may have participated in
the existing rebellion in any Slate or part
thereof, pardon and amnesty, with such
exceptions, and at such times, and on
such conditions as he may deem expedi
ent for the public welfare; and whereas,
the congressional declaration for limited
and conditional pardon accords with the
well established judicial exposition of the
pardoning power ; and whereas, with re
ference to said rebellion the president of
the United Slates has issued several pro
clamations with provisions in regard to
the liberation ot slaves; and whereas, it
is now desired by some persons hereto
fore engaged in said rebellion, to resume
their allegiance to the United Slates, and
lo re-inaugurate loyal Stale governments
within and Ibrthcir respective States:
Therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, Pres
ident of the United Stales, do proclaim,
declare and make known lo all persons
who have, directly or by implication, par
ticipated in the existing rebellion, except
as hereinafter excepted, that aTull pardon
is Iiereliy granted to them and each ol
lliem, wilh the restoration of all their
rights as property except ns to slaves and
in properly cases where Ilia rights ol
third partii-s shall have intervened, upon
ihe condition that every such person
shall lake and subscribe lo an oath and
thenceforward keep and maintain said
oath inviolate, which oath shall be regis
tered for permanent preservation, and
shall be of the tenor and t fleet following,
to wit :
' I do solemnly swear, in the presence
of Almighty God, that I will henceforth
faithfully support, protect and defend the
Constitution of the United States, nnd
the Union of I lie States thereunder ; and
llnil I will, in like manner, ahide by and
faithfully support all the nris of Con
gress passed during the existing rebellion
with reference to slaves, so long and so
far as they are not repealed, modified or
held void by Congress or by deci-ion of
the Supreme Court ; nnd that I will, in
like manlier, abide by and faithfully sup
port all the proclamations of the Presi
dent made during lh existing rebellion
having reference to slaves so tar as they
are not modified or declared void by In
decision of the Supreme Court. So help
me God. '
The persons excepted from the bene
fits of the foregoing provisions are ail
who are, or shall have been, civil or di
plomatic officers or agents of the so-called
confederate government; all who have
left judicial stations under the United
States lo aid the rebellion all who nr,
or shall have been, military or naval ofli
cers of said so-called confederate govern
ment, above the runk, of colonel in the
army and of lieutenant in the navy ; hII
who left seats i'n the United Slates Con
grfss to aid the rebellion j all who resign
ed commissions in the army or navy of
ibe United States and afterwards aided
the rebellion, and all who have engaged
in any way in treating colored persons,
or white persons in charge of such, nth
erwise than lawfully as prisoners of war.
such persons having been found in ibe
United S.ales service as soldiers, seamen,
or in any other capacity.
I do also further proclaim, declare nnd
make known that, whenever ia any of
the Stales of Arkansas, Texas, Louisi
ana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama,
Georgia, Florida, South Carolina and
North Carolina a number of persons, not
less than one tenth in number of the
votes cast in such State at the presiden
tial election of the year of our Lord one
thousand eight hundred and sixty, each
having taken the oath aforesaid and not
having since violated it, and being a qual
ified voter by the election law of the
Slate existing immediately before the so
called act of secession, nnd excluding all
others, shall re-establish a state govern
ment which shall be republican and in no
wise contravening said oath, such gov
ernment shall be recognized as the true
government of the State ; and the State
shall receive thereunder, the benefits of
the constitutional provision, which de
clares that "the United States shall guar
antee to every State in the Union a re
publican form of government, and shall
protect each of them against invasion on
application of the Legislature, or the Lx
eculive, when the Legislatuie cannot be
convened, nnd against domestic violence,
And I do further proclaim, declare and
make known that any provision, which
may be adopted by faid State govern
merit, in relation to the freed people of
such State, which shall recognize and de
clare their permanent freedom and pro
vide for their education, and which may
yet be consistent, as a temporary arrange
ment, widi tlieir present condition as a
laboring, landless and homeless class, will
not be objected to by the national Kxocu
live, and it is suggested as not improper
that, in constructing a loyal State gov
ernment in any State, the name of the
Slate, Ibe boundaries, the sub-divisions,
the constitution and the general code of
laws, as before the rebellion, lie main
tained, subject lo the modifications made
necessary by the condition hereinbefore
stated, and such others, if any, not con
travening said conditions, and which may
ho deemed expedient by -those framing
the new Stale government.
To nvoid misunderstanding, it may be
proper to say that Ibis proclamation, so
fur as it relates to State governments,
has no reference to States wherein loyal
Slate governments have all the while
been maintain d ; and for the same rea
son it may be proper to further say, that
whether members sent to Congress from
any Stale shall be admitted to seats, con
stitutionally rests exclusively with the
respective Houses, and not to any extent
with the Executive ; and still further that
this proclamation is intended lo present
to the people of the Stales, wherein the
national authority has been suspended
and loyal Stale governments have been
subverted, a mode in and by which the
national authority nnd loyal Slate gov
ernments may hu re-established williin
said Stales, or in any of them ; and while
(lie mode presented is the best the Ex
ecutive can suggH.-t, with his present im-
pres-ions, it must nit he understood that
no o'her mode woul I b"i acceptable.

THIRTY LIVES LOST.
OltLEANS LlRHRAL- INSTITUTE. The
close of the fall term has ngain come
round and perhaps a brief notice of the
school will not be amiss. Mr. and Mrs.
G. W. Todd have now had charge of this
institution for the past four years. We
think their capability as teachers has been
fully lested and demonstrated. The ex
aminations have always been very satis
factory. The fall school has numbered
about sixty scholars, which was a very
goodly number considering the numerous
select schools in tha neighboring towns.
It was very gratifying to nolico the pros
ficieney displayed by the different classes
in mathematics. It was evident they
well understood the ground they had been
over. All things considered the institute
has been well patronized from the first,
and it is the iotention of those connected
with it that it shall continue to be worthy
of the patronage it has heretofore had.
It is expected that the present teachers
will continue tlieir connection as princi
pal and preceptress. The spring term
will open at the usual tint".
The school closed with a very excel
lent exhibition in the evening. The eve
ning was one of the most stormy and
muddy we have had tliii autumn, but the
town house was taxed lo its utmost ca
pability. The exercises were very agree
ably inter.-peisf d with orations, essays,
and the dramatic The orations were
very creditable to their authors, the young
speakers exhibiting a good degiee of self
possession. The colloquy in w hich twen
ty five young ladies nod misses took a
part Miss 11. Herriam being the lead
ing character, was very well performed.
In mentioning this there is no intention
of spmking disparagingly of the other
dramatic performances.

News from Port Royal, S. C, to the
8th is received by the Fulton, which ar
rived at New York, Friday evening.
The Monitor Weehawken suddenly sunk
at her anchorage, off Morris Island, dur
ing a (;nle, on the Cth inst. Out of her
crew thirty were lost, including four as
sistant engineers. Her captain was on
board the flagship when the accident oc
curred. All the oilier officers, except
the above named four, were saved. No
damages were sustained by any of the
other iion-clads. The Herald's corres
pondent gives the following account of
the disaster :
Saturday had been a bright and beau
tiful day, with scarcely a breath of air
astir, and wilh a calm unruffled sea.
During the night a breeze sprang up,
and the wind, blowing freshly at day
light on Sunday, increased by noon to a
violent storm. The iron clad fleet was
lying meantime at its usual anchorage.
The frigate New Ironsides was stationed
off Morris Inland, ut a distance of about
ono mile due east from Fort Wagner
or, as it is now called, Fort Strong.
North of the Ironsides lay the flagship
Philadelphia, distance about four hun
dred yards. The Weehaken was next
in line, anchored two or three hundred
yards to the northward ot the flagship.
The first signal of distress was made
from the Weehawken at a few minutes
before two o'clock. The signal was seen
and answered at onco by the flagship,
from which four boats were dispatched
to her assistance, and by the South Car
ofna, which pent two of her boats to the
Weehawken' aid. The lugs Dandelion
and Iris were also at once called up, and
with them Commander Duncan of the
Weehawken, who chanced lo be on the
flagship, and in conversation with the
Admiral, when the signal was made,
proceeded immediately, tvitti the hope ol
running his vessel on the beach. He
had scarcely left the admiral when the
officer of the deck made out from the
Weehawken a new signal, and immedi
ately reported her lo be sinking. A
moment after she settled swiftly down
by the head, careerud slightly over lo
starboard, and disappeared beneath the
waves.
The confusion on the flagship, arising
mainly from tha difficulty of launching
her boats, and the desire of both officers
and men lo be first in them, was most in
tense and painful. The wind was now
blowing with great fury, and the boats
which hastened from nil eM.o lo lUp
scene encountered great peril in picking
up from the water the few who had suc
ceeded in getting away from the Wee
hawken before she sank. Almost at the
moment she went down some twenty or
more sprang to the boats and succeeded
in getting away. As many others were
rescukd from the surging waves by
tiie launches of the flagship, the South
Carolina and the tugboats Dandelion and
Iris. Thirty perished. There were
men in irons between decks, and the
sergeant-at-arms rushed frantically away
to release them. Poor fellows, they all
went down. There were invalids in the
sick bay, and to their relief the surgeon
sent his steward, who never returned.
There were firemen at the furnaces, to
whom vain shrieks for a helping hand at
the pumps were made. A few of the
confident were rushing to their quarters
to save their ( fleets, jostling the timid on
their way to the deck to save themselver.
It was in the midst of scenes like these
that the Weehawken went down. I be
lieve that none of the officers perished
save thd four assistant engineers, who
were overtaken dy the flood before they
could make any effort to escape. They
were, T. Horlie, J. B. Allen, Jr., II. W.
Merriam, A Mitchell. Commander
Duncan bad only taken command of the
Weehaken on Saturday, having been de
tached from Ibe Paul Jones to relieve
Commander Calhoun. The officers'
clothing, the paymaster's funds and the
paper of the ship sank with her.
War News.
Matters ik the Central Depart
ment. Bragg's army did not stop at
Dalton, Ga., on its retreat, but was going
to Resaea, twenty miles further south,
when last heard from. The Richmond
papers say its future line will rest upon
the Coosa river and its eastern tributa
ries, with Rome as the converging point.
Rome is a town where the rebels have
very extensive foundries, which our gen
erals in the West have twice or thrice
attempted to reach and destroy. Hook
er remained at Ringgold till the morning
of the 1st, and the town was burned by
the enemy after he abandoned it. A
Chattanooga letter to the Tribune says:
While our forces were at Ringgold hun
dreds of citizens for many miles around,
some of them bringing their families,
came into camp and asked for protection.
The most of theui did not disguise that
they had supported the rebellion. But,
they said this last blow would bo the
death of the confederacy, and there was
no use holding out longer. They repre
sented that the condition of that entire
population was deplorable, and that their
sufferings were becoming intolerable.
A few came to rejoice, to welcome the
old flag nnd to help carry it onward.
The greater part of those who came
wanted to come within our lines, and
begged to be permitted to do so. When

Friend Earle, It is bard to realize
that the array of the Potomac has been

we should have been within twelve miles
of Orange Court House a few days ago,
for now I look upon our old encamp
ments about Brandy Station and there is
no change visible. Yet it is neverthe
less true ; we bave been on a short and
seemingly unsuccessful campaign j we
bave crossed the Rapidan, have pressed
Lee back upon his fortifications, fought
one sharp battle all within the space of
five days ; the army has once more cros
sed the sacred line which good confeder
ates superstiliously believed was designed
by God as the bulwark, the impassable
defence, the impenetrable barrier of their
confederacy. What is most strange we
went over as easy as the Israelites went
through the Red Sea only a few men
got wet; there was a little difficulty but
no blood shed. Gen. Meade had every
thing in readiness for a flank movement
upon the enemy's right ; a few days b
fore leaving Brandy Station it was pub

would cross at Germania ford, the enemy
understood the rumor just ns designed.

Recruiting.
Recruiting goes bravely on in this
State, and so far as we have any knowl
edge, in most of the others. Tho offer of
large town bounties has had the effect to
bring out the men, and the season of tha
year is favorable for enlistments. We
think there will be no draft in this State.
Two hundred dollars is the smallest town
bounty that we hear being offered in tliii
State. Rutland gives $500, Hartlanrl
$500, and several other towns give the
same j Westminster otters $000, Bethel
t-100, and a great many other towns of
fer $300. The above bounties are to
actual residents.
. In this county the work of recruiting
goes on swimmingly. The quotas for tha
towns of Albany, Glover, Barton, Cov
entry, and several olber towns are now
full. Jay has filled ht-r quota besides
enlisting some four or more uu ilm next

Terror in Charleston-. General
Gillmore is engaged in strengthening his
batteries on Morris Island, and keeps
up just sufficient fire upon the enemy's
works to maintain his gunners in prac

from the bombardment, is wide-spread.
Business men and residents were re
treating beyond the range of our guns.

thing else. Its Five Twenty Years Six
Per Cent Loan, the interest on which is
promptly paid in gold, has been subscri

money market, at an average of more
than two millions per day. And, what
is not the least gratifying fact in connec

this popular lean, scarcely any of it is
returned tc the market for sale. It is
taken for investment, and is held with
unfaltering confidence in its reliability.
And why should it not be ? It is s en,

Thursday was clear and cold ; the next
morning the troops resumed their march.
Sykes was to go past Paiker's store to I years of the most gigantic war that the
the Orange and Fredericksburg plank
road, which be was lo follow until he
reached New Hope church, the 2d corps
was to reach Robertson's tavern where
the road forks and was to hold the centre
of the line while the 3d was to be on the
right. Gen. Gregg was on the left wilh
his division of cavalry, Carter on the
right, while Buford covered the rear, the
3d corps first met the enemy, their road
was a hard one to travel. Gen. Prince's
division led the, van where he was attack
ed at what is called farm. We were
not unprepared for the enemy. Prince's
division was soon in battle array ; Gen.
Carr with one division of French's corps
now came up and deployed to the left ol

his 1st division stood in readiness, but in
reserve, i'or a time we held our ground,
but the other divisions of the enemy come

If this can be done while the war is be

culty in readily accomplishing it when
the war shall be ended? What better
investment, then, for capital, than the
"Five-Tweniy" Government Loan ? But
if any doubt, let him refer to the statis
tics furnishedtby the censusstables of the
various nations of the world. The facts
which tUry present will pwive the most .
satisfactory mode of dispelling the num
berless cloomy apprehensiens winch are
being continually conjured up by tboss
who are disposed to exaggerate the ex-
lent of the calamity occasioned by our
rebellion. A - reference to tha state of
most of the prosperous nations of the
old world clearly disproves such a posi
tion, and shows that tha highest conai
lion of a national advancement have not
been materially effected by the extended
wars in which those nations have been
immemorially engaged, and that heavy
national indebtedness bas not proved an
unmitigated evil.
