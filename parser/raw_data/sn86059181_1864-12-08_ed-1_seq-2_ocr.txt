Rmoiw. There u a rnmor in Hei -derson
jtalnrdij that tha rebel General
Ljod, with a force of 900 men, wu
within twenty-eight milee of Henderson,
moling in that direction.
We doubt the romor, aa we are in
clined to the belief that all the rebel
forces in Kentucky and fVeit Tennes
see, except a few straggling bands of
thieves, have been concentrated with
Hood Jn front of Nashville; bnt it will
not be nnwise for the citizen of Hen
derson, especially the Federal forces at
that post, to be on the alert and pre
pared for anv emergency. The force at
Henderson is large and well entrenched,
nnd with proper caution will he able to
give a warm reception and entertain
ment to aoj rebel force that is liksly to
visit that place.
Thb Pbuidcst's Missaoi. -We lay
before car readers this morning the
President's Message, in as correct
form as we have been able to receive it,
in part by telegraph and partly copied
from the Missouri Democrat.
The failure of the mail last night
from Cincinnati, prevents ns from re
ceiving the Cincinnati papers in which
it is perhaps contained more correctly.
. There are, evidently, many imperfec
tions in oar report of the message, ren
dering some passages almost unintelli-
gitile, hut the general tone of the mes
sage can be readily conceive- by the in
telligent reader.
, We shall, in a few days, receive aa
ollicial copy when we will lay it before
our readers,
FoK Livkrpool. In another column
will be found an advertisement of the
eelrhrated Inman line of etetmships,
lorining a weekly line between the M ni
di States and Liverpool. The vessels
are all first class, under the command
of experienced officers, and with the
rnoat comfortable) accommodations.
M-ir. Behm & Anthes.of this city, are

(Ji-nuRUL.s ii lltfimssos. We were
told lusi night that fonr guerrillas en
ured Henderson oa Tuesday night and
made an attempt to capture Col Glenn,
i ho commanding officer at that post,
bnt were happily foiled in the attempt,
out made their escape before the garri
on could be aroused.
It whs a bobl and impudent movement,
nnd wt- n gret that Col. Glenn was not
ulj.a to capture the scoundrels and have
an'oilier shooting match.

A Genku.l OcTFLASitB. Shortly
after sevan o'clock on Friday morning
lust, a thief entered the chamber of
Gen. Wallace, at the Eutaw House, Bal
timore and stole thivty-five dollars from
his pantaloons pockets. The General
was awakened by the noise of the in
truder, and leaped from the bed for tfea
purpose of capturing the enemy. The
latter, however, by a skillful movement,
succeeded in retreating in good order
with his booty, and locked the General
in his room, the key of the room door
being on the outside.

The question naturalty arises, why is
tbe Kev, John vT Johnson sent to Indi

the poor? Or is it .supposed that Indi

Indiana has poured out her blood like
water, and her gold without stint, to
carry on the war, to succor the poor and
needy, and i ever ready to do all that
justice, patriotism and philanthropy may
demand of her, but our people do not
Deed that strangers should eotne into

In view of the insecurity of life in the
region adjacent to the Canadian border,
by recent assault and depredations
committed by inimical and desperate
persons, who are harbored there, it has
been thought proper to gir notice that
after tha expiration of six month; the
period conditionally stipulated in tbe
existieg relation with Great Bricaia, tbe
United States must hold themselves at
liberty to increase tksirnaval arm meat
upon tbe lakes, if thty shall find tbat
proceeding necesaary. The condition of
the border will, arecessariiy, come in con
sideration ia connection with the ques
tion of continuing or modifying the
rights of transit trom Canada through
the United States, as well as the regula
tion of imports, which were temporarily
established by tbe Keciprocity treaty of
the 5th of June, 1&.H. I desire, how
eve, to be understood while making this
statement, that the Colonial authorities
are not deemed to be intentionally un
just r . unfriendly towards the United
States, but,, on the contrary, there is
very reaaon la expact that with the ap
proval ot tbe imperial government, they
will take the necessary measures to pre
vent new incursions across the border.
The act passed at tbe last session far

It seems to need an amendment which
will enable the officer of the Govern

and on their arrival in tb ports, so as
to "secure them here free choice of avo
cation and place t settlement A
liberal disposition towards this great na
tional policy is manifested by most of
tbe r-urapea Mates, and ought to be
reciprocated on cur pert by giving th
emigrants eUtUve national protection
I regard our emigrants as on tf the
priucipal replenishing streams which

1 be public debt on the fr.i Jr. r.f
July last, as appears by tha books of tbe
Treasury, amounted lo one billion, sev
en hundred and forty millions, six hun-
ori ana ninety thousand dollars and
forth nine cent. Probably, ehosid the
war continue - for another year, that
amount may be increased by not far
from 500,0 H),Ooa Held as it is, for
tbe most part by eur own people, it has
become a substantia! branch of Nation
al, though private property. For ebviou
reasons, tbe mora nearly this property can

To favor such general distribution,
greater inducement to become owners
might, perhaps, with goed effect and
without difficulty b prsseated to persons
of limited taeaaa With thia view, 1
suggest whether it might not be both ex
pedient and competent for Congress to
provide tbat a limited amount of some
further issue of public securities, might
be held by any bona fid purchaser ex
empt from taxation and from seizure
