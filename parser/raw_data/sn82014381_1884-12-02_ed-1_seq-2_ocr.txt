THE CITY DEBT.
When the city bond question was de
bated early in its later history, this journal
advocated a policy that it believed would
have brought about an economical adjust
ment of the city indebtedness — a policy
dictated by common honesty ami economic
municipal interest. During the debate it
was noticed that thi- position taken, and
which the Courts have since affirmed as
tile true interpretation of the law, was
vituperativcly assailed in certain quarters,
and the profound and weighty reply ad
vanced to all argumentative and dispas
sionate fm:m.-i:il suggestions was compassed
and expressed in the cry of "bondholders'
organ." In short, it was quite the thing
to pour out invective upon this journal.
and to meet all suggestions it addressed to
the business sense, with chaVges of venal
ity. At the time it was suspected that
this course on the part of certain cliques
and influences \v:l> pursued in the interest
of speculators in city bond-. It wag more
than a suspicion that the policy pursued
was in the line of a pre 'oncertcd plan to
(liable certain parties to buy up the city's
paper at a low figure by pre
fentiiifr the city from availing of
the opportunity that frequently offered, of
adjusting or refunding at a saving to her
not now possible. Since then, as the
di sisions have successively gone against
the city, and her creditors have got a
firmer and still tinner >;rip upon her throat.
the security all their while augmenting by
reason of the outlay of money in local
improvements by thi> people, and the in.
creasing commercial Importance of the
city, the suspicion referred to ripened
into belief. Recently we stated that be
lief in unmistakable terms. We announced
that public influences had been used in
the interest of bondholder speculators, and
Chat this was done for :t consideration.
We stated our readiness to establish it it'
the pro;,.-!- official investigation was -et
on foot in which the evidences could be
presented. These evidences -nil exist
Natural:; OJ posed to the city and the
position of this paper, they will be difficult
of production ; bat very lately we have in
even stronger language than before an
nounced it as .1 fact that they do exist, and
that the testimony substantiating our
charges is of the. strongest character,
pra«ti.:'l'v indisputable and crushing.
We :iro now ■'.! to "out with it." In
goad time ; and perhaps when it arrives
the demand for it-- production will Ik' less
rigorous. If the city authorities have
sufficient interest in the matter to insti
tute the necessary investigation in which
something more than a newspaper trial
may be conducted, tin' counts of the in
dictment will be ready and the witnesses
indicated.
A CORRECTION.
In Mir i . — lit- of Saturday occurred one of
those occasional errors that are quite as
amusing as they arc annoying. In an
article on th" homicide in Ohio, where a
Spiritualistic doctor managed by his in
cantations and* manipulations to ftul the
earthly tribulations of a patient, tire manu
script very plainly read: "Whatever
there in of good in Spiritualism; whatever
♦f truth there is in the manifestations —
and we are not prepared to condemn all as
fraudulent — it is clear that human laws
for the protection of society cannot admit
for a moment the act of ■ 'control.'" The
compositor made the parenthetical sentence
road — and we are mm prepared to con
demn all: 88 fraudulent. The error was
overlooked and thus precisely the opposite
meaning from that intended was con
■ veyed. .

ous Moral designs ornamented the desks of

pied by Barbour of Virginia, and a tasteful
basket of variegated flowers adorned the
Speaker's table. The members indulged in
the usual greetings, exchanging congratu
lations on re-election or condolences on

was shown on either side.

Springfield, Dec-ember Ist. — The State
Canvassing Board completed its work to
day, and decided the contest in the Thir
teenth Legislative District in favor ofMul
bevan andagain3f Klupp. This will make
the Legislature a tie on joint ballot, in case
Lemon (Rep.) in the Sixth District is
seated, or will give a Democratic majority
of two in case Brand ■ Dem.), of the same
district, is given tin- seat. Klupp claims
that 9o rotes for him in the nineteenth pre
cinct of tiie fourteenth Ward were counted
for his opponent, and he will present his
case to the United States Grand Jury, or
will contest ii before thi' Senate. The facts
were shown to be. before both the County
and State Canvassing Hoards, that by a
clerical error Klupp was originally given
!kp votes '.00 many. As both Klupp and
Mulbevan are Democrats, the complexion
• ■I' the Legislature will not be changed in
either case. Governor Hamilton will an
nounce his decision in the Brand-Lemon
case to-morrow.
rsECOKD DISPATCH.!
Chicago, December Ist— An open loiter
will be published here to-morrow from
Rudolph Brand, the Democratic candidate
for State Senator from the Sixth District,
to Henry W. Lemon, his Republican oppo
nent. Brand .-ays thai while he ran ahead
of his ticket elsewhere, and had reason to
believe be would do the same in the second
precinct of tin- Eighteenth Ward, where it
is alleged the fraud was committed which
added 200 votes to Brand's count, yet. it
Leman's claim to this effect is correct, it
would show that he (Brand) ran behind
his ticket in that precinct Still, from the
fact that the ballots in the box indicate that
Lemon's father-in-law, brother-in-law and
other intimate friends voted for Brand, he
Brand) is inclined to the opinion that these
ballots are fraudulent. He therefore pro
poses to 1. email that they jointly ranvass
the votes in tli.' entire precinct, and if it is
found that ballots .if a similar character
have been deposited in other precincts the
matter can be settled by the testimony of
voters throughout the district on the ques
tion as to whom they voted.

nothing in a little while.

State Treasurer January's new bond isstill
an uncertainty, several of the sureties, new
and old, having expressed their desire to be
relieved, and it is said that the Governor
has notified him to appear before him and
show cause why his otHce should not be
declared vacant.
W. S. Leake, Deputy Clerk of the Su
preme Court, has devised a system of books
and checks which it is thought will in a
great measure prevent State officials, their
deputies ami clerks, from embezzing fees.
Controller Dunn will probably suggest in
his report the adoption of some such sys
tem of checks and books.
The San Francisco Examiner of yesterday
reports an interview with Governor Stan
ford, in which he is represented as saying :
" My intention is to retire from active busi
ness as soon as possible. I want to have
some measures accomplished before leav
ing the railroad. When the Southern line
is completed to New Orleans and both
roads are placed under one management,
which will probably be done before very
long, 1 will retire and devote myself to
other affairs."

{ '-He Drew the Gun Toward Him Huzzle
First."
Pktaluma, December Ist. — The remains
{ of Dr. L. Dias, who accidentally shot and
killed himself yesterday, while hunting in
the marsh four miles below the city, were
brought into town about 11 o'clock hist
night, and an inquest was held this morn
ing, which developed the following facts :
Yesterday (Sunday) morning at ;> o'clock
Mr. Dias, in company with John Stone, a
young man employed in his dentist office,
started on a hunting expedition on the
marsh below town. At 10:30 o'clock, and
when about four miles from town, the two
men separated, Dias getting into a small
boat to cross the creek to a marsh where
ducks were numerous, and young Stone
traveling on ahead on tho mainland, the
two agreeing to meet at the same spot at 12
v. Mr. Stone, returning at a later hour
than bad been designated, saw the boat in
the tales on the opposite shore, but Mr.
Dias was not in sight. Supposing, he aays.
that he w:is concealed in the tules, and
perhaps waiting for the ducks to jet
bunched, he waited quietly for some time ;
but seeing do sign of his companion
he called to him repeatedly and tired his
gun several times, but failing to attract his
attention. After waiting upwards of two
hours he became alarmed and sought
means of crossing the creek, making the
first attempt with a ladder. Failing in
this, a boat was secured, and in company
with two men reached the opposite bank
and crossed, where they found the object
of their search prone upon his back at the
cud of the boat, cold in death. His gun
stood upright in the boat, the hammer un
der the seat. It was a plainly told tale.
He had evidently attempted to draw the
gun by the muzzle toward him, the ham
mer striking the seat and the contents of
the chamber was discharged in his heart,
he dying instantly, as the churge had passed
entirely through the heart. Deceased was
2S years of age, n native of Now Orleans.
La., and bad been for many years a promi
nent dentist of this city, where he leaves
an aged mother, a wife and child, a sister
and a large circle of friends to mourn his
untimely taking off.
Los Anjicles City Election.
Los AhqklES, December Ist. — The city
election to-day passed off quietly, but <puit"e
a full vote was placed. The interest cen
tered on the Mayor, Collector and Treas
urer. At 10 r. M. not half the votes are
counted, and the result cannot be positively
known until morning. In all the wards,
so far as counted, E. F. Spence, the Repub
lican candidate for Mayor, leads, and his
election by some •WO is generally conceded.
It is believed that Parcells, Collector, and
Kays, Treasurer, both on the Democratic
ticket, are elected by small majorities. The
tickets are found to be largely scratched,
and predictions as to the outcome on all
the candidates are timidly indulged in.
