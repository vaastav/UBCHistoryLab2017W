"James G. Blaine is not a candidate for
President. He will, at what he considers
the proper time, announce that he is not a
candidate, and unless the National Conven
tion disregards his positive declaration and
nominates him against his will, Mr. Blaine
will remain in his present position and trill
be earnestly for the renomination and re
election of President Harrison," said a
Pittsburg Republican of prominence, who
is visiting the capital, to your correspon
dent to-dr.y. The Pittsburger is a near rel
ative of Secretary Blaine's, and he talks
knowigly of Mr. Blaine's position in poli
tics and his relations with President Har
rison. "President Harrison and Secretary Blaine
understand each other perfectly well," the
Pittsburg gentleman said. "Notw ithstand
inc the reports to the contrary they are
warm personal friends, and President Har
rison enjoys the unqualified support of Mr.
Blaine for renomination and re-election.
Everything is fair in war or politics, and so
long as the people are not entirely satisfied
that Mr. BWine will not submit to the use
of his naae by the National Convention,
Jut so long will other unfriendly opposi
tion to President Harrison be kept out of the
f-eld.
A Claim of Perfect Harmony.
"If Mr. Blaine were to say soho would be
made the candidate for President without
opposition. He knows that, and his friends
know it, too, hut he is true to President
Harrison, and in a short time the Secretary
will make public in a positive way his
declination to stand for the nomia'f.ion.
No one more than President Harrison ap
preciates Secretary Blaine's popularity.
The country at large misunderstands the
relations existing between the two. There
is the roost striking harmony between
them, and the efforts of both have been to
give to the country a clean, careful
administration. They have acted together
so far, and they will, I think, act together
until the end of Harrison's term. If
Blaine's unbounded popularity should lead
the National Convention to disregard his
positive declination and nominate him over
Mr. Harrison, the President's desire to have
a Republican succeed him, and the friendly
feeling he entertains for his Secretary of
State, would prompt him in urging upon
Mr. Blaine the importance of accepting.
But such a condition is not likely to arise.
It would be unfair to the other gentlemen
throughout the country who would be can
didates n-ainfit Mr. Harrison, but who
uould not go into the field against Mr.
ltl.iine.
Hairing Oat the Other Aspirants.
"With Secretary Wains pronounced in
his support ot Harrison, the renomination
of the President is practically assured. In
this belief both Blaine and Harrison are
content. The greatest point now is to delay
Mr. Blaine's declaration of intentions.
Mot of those distinguished gentlemen who
opposed President Harrison for the nomi
nation four years ago are restlessly await
ing definite information from the Secretary.
Their friends, too, are anxious, and Mr.
Blaine is constantly being urged to declare
himself. For him to go on record now
against accepting the nomination means the
candidacy of Gresham, Alger, McKinley,
and probably Sherman and Depew. It also
means a fight which Mr. Harrison and Mr.
Blaine are anxious to avoid. For Mr.
Blaine to delay the declaration so anxiously
ft waited will, it is feared, embitter the feel
ing against the President and will leave tne
other opponents cold and uninterested in
their support of him after he is nominated.
This gies to the case a rather serious
phase, and the world is not likely to be
kept in suspense much longer. A public
declaration may be expected from Blaine
within a month and perhaps before Christ
mas. "The kindly feeling existing between the
President and his Secretary of State, and
their harmonious action has been clearly
illustrated iu the Collector Warmcastle
trouble. I know that Congressman Dalzell
has not acted unfriendly to Mr. Warmcastle,
but he has been advised with by the Presi
dent and Mr Blaine, and it looks now as
though the Collector would be removed
within 4S hours. Mr. Dalzell has not raised
a hand against the Collector, but he was
also unable to raise a hand in his behalf.
Dalzell and the Administration.
"The "Warmcastle trouble has forced a
peculiar combination among the Pennsyl
vania leaders. It brings Quay, Magee,
"Warmcastle and others close together, and
with no justification unites them in oppo
tition to Congressman Dalzell, not only for
the United States Senate, but for Congress.
Six months ago Quay and Magee were as
far apart personally as are. Maine and
Texas, but to-day they are closer together
than ever they were. But, rtrange as.it
mar seem, that combination against Mr.
W.ANTS of all kinds are quickly answered
through THE DISPATCH. Investors, arti
sans, bargain hunters, buyers and sellers
clofcely scan Its Classified Advertising Col
ud -v Largest circulation.
Dalzell has only strengthened him, and
hereafter he will be the recognized repre
sentative of the Administration in Pennsyl
vania. He will have the support of the
President and Mr. Blame in every move ho
makes, and if I mistake not he will be in a
better position to combat his enemies than
his enemies think.
"If the "Warmcastle trouble should be
come a national issue in the event of which
Mr. Dalzell will appear for the first time
opposing Mr. Magee and acting directly
for the administration. Frank P. Case, the
ex-Collector of Pittsburg, will probably be
named to fill the office. His application
for the place with Congressman Dalzell's
hearty indorsement are still on file in the
department They were sent here before
"Warmcastle was appointed. If Case is
nominated Senators Quay and Cameron
will, if possible, have the nomination hung
up in the Senate, and then will come the
tug of war between the Pennsylvania
giants and the administration, and then
will follow the certain declaration that Mr
Dalzell is the administration's leader in his
own State. Mr. Quay's strength in Penn
sylvania is solely due to his control of
Federal patronage in his State. To trans
fer the power of patronage to Dalzell means
disaster for Quay."
A Formal Announcement Soon.
Dalzell will shortly announce himself as
a candidate for the United States Senate to
succeed Senator Qnay. His campaign has
not yet been organized, and he will make
his public declaration at the time when he
- - -
thinks that it is proper.
"I shall publicly state my intentions,"
said Mr. Dalzell to-night, "when I think it
is proper to do so. If there are many Re
publicans in the State who are ready to sup
port me for the Senatorship, of course, I
feel gratified by the implied compliment,
but there is no one authorized to announce
that I am a candidate for Senator Quay's
seat. Any authoritative declaration one
wav or the other on that subject I will
make personally and publiclv."
It is assumed that the announcement of
the President's decision in the "Warmcastle
case will be followed by an open statement
from Congressman Dab-ell that he will in
augurate the contest for the Sena
torship. Mr. Dalzell's public serv
ices in the House will be of
advantage to him In the coming struggle.
He is a ready speaker and was put forward
bv the Republicans as the leading talker in
all the important elections cases that came
up before him during the last Congress.
In regard to the report that there is an
organized movement in Pittsburg to defeat
Mr. Dalzell for renomination for Congress,
he said to-night: "I have read that there is
danger ahead for me, but I cannot sav that
I feel alarmed. A number of gentlemen
were quoted as opposing me whom I know
are my friends and will support me. From
this I feel assured that there is more sen
sationalism than truth in the report."
BLAINE TOLD JONES SO.
THE EX-CHAITUIAN SATS THE MAINE
MAN "WILL NOT BE A CANDIDATE.
He "Would Certainly Know If the Waving
Flume Was Again to Iad the Repub
lican Hosts A Statement That Is De
cidedly Interestlnc
"Mr. Blaine told me he would not be a
candidate for the Presidency," B. ,F. Jones
said to a Dispatch reporter last night
Mr. Jones was Chairman of the National
Republican Committee in 1884, when Mr.
Blaine was defeated for the JPresidencyby'
Grover Cleveland. Secretary Blaine and
B. F. Jones have for years been warm per
gonal friends. They enjoy each other's con
fidence, and each holds the other in highest
esteem.
"It was some time ago that Mr. Blaine
assured me he would not again be a candi
date for the Presidency," Mr. Jones went
on, "but I know now of no reason for his
changing his mind."
"You have always stood close to Mr.
Blaine, have you not?"
"Yes, we have always been warm friends.
I have not seen Mr. Blaine since his sick
ness. I did not visit Bar Harbor last
season, and, therefore, I am not as well pre
pared to talk for Mr. Blaine as I might
otherwise have been."
Jones Would Have Had a Tip.
"You would likely know if Mr. Blaine
intended being a candidate, would you
not?"
"I would probably have heard of it in
someway."
"You received the famous Florence letter
from Mr. Blaine in 1888?"
"Yes, the letter was addressed to me."
"What reason did Mr. Blaine give for
writing that letter?
"Well," Mr. Jones answered, in a hesi
tating way, "Mr. Blaine afterward ex
plained to me that it was his ambition to
be the Republican condidate for President
in 1876. He was not, I believe, ambitious
for theplace after that, and his nomination
later was not the fruits of his own efforts,
but he bowed to the will of his friends.
"In view of the Solid South and the un
certain and unsettled conditions in the
"West, who would be the strongest Republi
can candidate for the Presidency?
"Blaine can be elected or Harrison can
be re-elected. The "West is not unsettled in
a national fieht The people out there are
in accord with the position of the Republi
cans on the tariff question. "With their
millions of barrels of flour and their great J
quantity of beer, and with an Eastern mar
ket that pays them more than they can get
by exporting their products, they are not at
war with our system of tariff. They may
quarrel about twine and such things, but
thev are all right on the main issue."
''Can Mr. Harrison carry Massachusetts?"
"1 think so. The New Kuglanders are
selfish. They won't entirely tree raw ma
terisl, and then they want' their products
protected. I think, however, the State will
go Republican in a national contest. The
result in Ohio and in this State tells how
the people like the McKinley bill. I look
upon it as the best tariff measure we have
ever had, and I have had much experience
with tariff bills."
hprlnger's Ideas on the Tarlffi
"What do you think of Congressman
Springer's jfroposition to send a committee
through the country and upon its report re
vise the McKinley "bill?"
"I think that course will not prove in
jurious to the interest of the country. I
am sorry" continued Mr. Jones, "that Mr.
Mills was not chosen Speaker of the House.
He, like Cleveland is willing to go the full
length on the tariff question."
"Did you read the President's message."
"Yes, I read it carefully. I look upon it
as one of the strongest messages ever sent
to Congress. It was especially clear and
distinct and can be easily understood by
everybody. There is I, believe, only one
fault to be found with Mr. Harrison. He
has not given the offices to everybody's
friend. But he has been a careful, judicious
President and all the interests have been
sate in his hands. They talk about his
wearing his grandfather's hat. He is ten
times a stronger man than ever his grand
father was.
"The President has the cordial support
of Secretary, Blaine, and the administra
tion has been entirely satisfactory. If re
nominated he will be re-elected."
"Will you be a candidate for national
delegate?"
"1 am not a candidate for national dele
gate," Mr. Jones answered
It is understood among his friends, how
ever, that if named as a delegate he will at

rSTFCIAI. TELEGRAM TO TOE BISPATCH.l
New York, Dec. 11. "The money mar
ket is on the eve of one of the most exciting
episodes in the history of the street," sajd
Mr. George Crouch to-day. "Jar Gould,
iie ann dttnrrra nrA tlipir fnllnwerg are aWaV
U.O W. WV.BW ...... . v.. .
Bnort 0f the market, and the point has been
about reached where they will begin to Duy
in. Everybody, of course, knows that this
will create a sharp advance in stocks.
"It appears to be a duel between the
Gould and Vanderbilt forces. It has been
known for some time that their was an un
precedented short interest in American
stocks, and on settlement days, which occur
fortnightly, London people have naturally
wondered and asked who the people were
on the bear side, which is only natural with
a big firm carrying any amount of stocks.
"Now, why did Mr. Gould, who has more
ready money than, perhaps, any man in this
country, look with favor on the great ex
port of gold, unless he desired to bear the
market? The heavy export caused no little
alarm on the street at the time, almost 563,
000,000 being sent to Europe, of which only
about 527,000,000 has been returned. To be
candid, it is believed by stock brokers in
general that Mr. Gould was largely respon
sible lor this large export.
Investors Reaping a Harvest.
"It is well known that when Gould got a
a controling interest of the Union Pacific
he opposed Charles Francis Adams, who
was ousted, and some say, evidently tried
to throw the road into the hands of a re
ceiver, but that Morgan and the Vanderbilts
took charge of the floating debt for three
years and blocked his plan. When these
facts are considered, it will be seen that the
Gould people stand to lose something up in
the millions. The speculators, however,
are not making any money out of the deal,
but the investors, who buy stock out and
oui, are the people who are reaping the
harvest.
"Some people say that Gould's only sal
vation will be some terrifh crash, such as
'Black Fridav,' in which event he can buy
in his short 'interests at a profit. But I
think Gould will emulate Napoleon, in a
certain sense. As long as Napoleon was
advancing with his army he carried every-thing-before'hlm
and- the enfimyfld:-hut
when he gave the order to retreat the Cos
sacks wheeled around and hastened his
steps."
Others corroborated Mr. Crouch, the
majority adding that there was no clique or
combination to down Gould, but that it was
the natural course of the market, and that
Gould had placed himself in the predica
ment set forth, and would probably pay the
tolls before he got through. One broker
who was seen, but did not wish to be
quoted, said he thought it was more the fol
lowers of George Gould and George himself,
that were short of the market, and that the
old gentleman naturally had to back them
Up.
What" the Gonld Folks Have to Say.
At Mr. Gould's office it was said he had
not been down town to-day. George had
gone to the country, and Eddie, who was
the only representative in the office, said
thnt the people on the street were famous
for guessing, and this time they had guessed
wrong. Washington E. Connor had this to
say: "There has been a heavy short interest
in New York for over a year, but from all
information received from Europe, there is
none there. I do not keep Mr. Gould's
books, and therefore cannot speak intelli
gently regarding his transactions. I know
that there are a number of honses in the
street that are large borrowers of stock, but
who they represent or who they are borrow
ing for is merely guesswork."
George Gould, of the Missouri Pa cific
Railroad Company, notified Insnector
Byrnes to-dav of the loss of 18 certificates
representing 1,414 shares of Missouri Pa
cific stock. The certificates were lost by a
messenger from the Missouri Pacific office,
after leaving the Mercantile Trust Com
pany's offices, where he had taken the cer
tificates to have them transferred. The
transfer iB incomplete, as the certificates
are not indorsed by the officers of the com
panv, and they are not negotiable. Young
Mr.'Gould notified Mr. Bvrnes of the loss,
fearing that innocent parties might be in
dued to receive the certificates.
Decon White's Grain Speculations.
Almost from the hour when S. V. White
& Co. suspended. Wall street has had re-
Sorts that Mr. White had been tricked by
'ew York and Chicago grain speculations.
The statements were all to the effect that
people who should have been loyal to him
in the great corn deal had been false. The
firm of Field, Lindley. Wiechers & Co. was
pointed to at the time because of its close as
sociatiou with Mr. White's deal. It was
said that while Mr. White was making
heavy purchases of corn for a rise, Field,
Lindley, Wiechers & Co., and other brokers
associated with them weie "coppering"
him and selling short.
The reports have been revised in the last
few days, and to-day word came from Chi
cago that they were substantially true. Mr.
White said on the subject: -'I do not have
knowledge to confirm these rumors, and I
onlv know what Field, Lindley, Wiechers
& Co. were advancing on corn, and carrying
and shipping it for me. I had a good deal
of money in their hands, and I have no evi
dence in my possession to base the charge
upon that triey went short on corn which I
ordered bought. I do know that they
shipped some."

New York financiers had a heavy failure
to talk about to-day. It was that of Francis
Baker & Co., drygoods commission mer
chants, who made a general assignment
without preference to-day to Lawyer Wel
come S. Jarvis. Francis Baker, the senior
partner and capitalist of the firm, has been
in business since 1861. On January 1, 1889,
young Wendell Baker was admitted into
partnership. He is the famous Harvard

One cause' or the failure was iacK oi
funds. The business had been gradually
decreasing, trade was very dull, prices
were low, and the margin of profit was very
small. The business had been running be

did not appreciate his position. He had
been nutting into the business stone.

A Knmor Credited to Hears.
A rumor was freely circulated in Wall
street to-day that a confidential clerk in one
of the largest banking houses on Broad,

money had been lost by Field, Lindley,
Wiechers & Co. in Btock and grain specu
lation. The rumor could not be verified in
the street.
Inquiry at the Windsor Hotel to-night
developed nothing. Everyone in the cor
ridors of the hotel, among them Isidore
and Simon Wormser, denied that any de
falcation had occurred, so far as they
knew.
The general opinion was that the rumor
was started by a clique of bears, who took
what they thought the most effectual means
of depressing the market.
BYNUM TO BE FORGIVEN.
W1FTNG OCT HIS CENTCKE FOE CALL
ING BATNE NAMES.
The Big Majority In the Present House to
Do the Act Cutcheon's Euccessor to
Offer the Resolution Wheeler's Great
Ban of Luck.
Washington, Dec. 11. Special The
lively scene in the House last session, when
Representative Bynum was centured by
Speaker Beed for referring to Representa
tive "Tom" Bayne, of Pittsburg, as a sewer,
which expression he afterward modified to
that of a "conduit pipe" is apt to be recalled
soon after the holiday recess.
The man who called Mr. Bynum to order
and demanded that his words be taken
down, which motion resulted in the censure,
was General Cutcheon, of Michigan, now
the civilian member of the Army Board of
Fortifications. The man who proposes to
recall the fight by a resolution providing
that the record of censure be expunged from
the journal in General Cutcheon's suc
cessor, Judge Wheeler. There has been
considerable talk among the members re
garding the advisability of an expunging
resolution, and it is thought there would be
no opposition on the Democratic Bide to its
adoption.
Judge Wheeler is having honor and prom
inence thrust upon him with rapidity. He
was formerly a Republican, but became a
Democrat in 1872, and was nominated for
Congress last fall merely as a matter of
form. There was no thought of his elec
tion, as the district has always been over
whelmingly Republican. The tidal wave
snept the usual majority out of sight, how
ever, and Wheeler was elected. His j;ood
luck stuck to him, and when, on Tuesday,
the 332 members of the House entered into
the big lottery for seats, the first name
called was that of Wheeler. Now he gets
another chance for notoriety.
The Judge made one mistake, however,
that is apt to offset all his good luck. In
the Speakership fight he started out for
Springer, and then, at the instance of Mr.
Bvnum and Don Dickinson, he changed ty
Mills and remained with him until the light
of the Texas candidate went out.
A NEW KIND OF (JRIP.
Those "Who Get It Imagine They Have
Sciatica Shooting Fains That Finally
Settle in the Muscles Many Mills Partly
Shot Down by It.
BAivriMORr, Dec 11. Special. A
peculiar malady prevails in this city, which
the doctors pronounce "a new1 form ofgrip1.
The victim is first attacked with shooting
pains through the limbs, and as these in
crease in severity they settle in the muscles,
producing soreness to the touch. Then the
trouble lodges in the joints, and the sufferer
thinks he has sciatica.
The pain is not confined to any one sec
tion, but jumps about, preferring the thigh.
The doctors say the trouble is muscular and
neuralgia, and is epidemic.
There is a very little influenza, nor are
any other features of the old grip noticeable
to any extent. Those most severely affected
go to bed.
In the cotton and duck mills in Wood
berry many looms are idle, owing to the
grip, and work is interfered with.

The limit of membership is 400, and until
quite recently the list was full. A few

MILLS MUST EIGHT
Or Be Content With a Back
Seat in the Crisp-Spring-.

HIS FEIENDSEXPECT WAB.
At Present He Is Too 111 to Attempt
to Outline His Pnrposes.
THE NEW SPEAKER GETS PRAISE
From Congressmen Who Want to Get Good
Places on Committees.
FOSTER'S FIGURES SHARPLY AflALTZED
fPEOM X STAFT COnRESPOSDEVT.l
Washington, Dec 11. All the indica
tions point to the probability that Mr. Mills
must either take a back seat in the House or
fight. These are the only -alternatives left
to him if the present Crisp-Springer pro
gramme is carried out. As was outlined in
yesterday's Dispatch, the present Speaker
is endeavoring to reverse in a measure, the
radical free trade tendencies of his party,
and to substitute therefor a bogus tariff re
form that will leave things very much as
they have been since the McKinley bill be
came a law.
The influences which elected Mr. Crisp
are well known. He had the outside sup
port of Gorman and Hill, and those Demo
cratic interests which are palpably opposed
to the Cleveland-Mills doctrine of breaking
down the protection wall. Calvin S. Brice
was in the combination of outsiders, and his
work is seen in the almost solid support
which the Ohio Democrats gave Crisp.
Tjiese politicians want the Presidental
issue fought out with the tariff occupying
as small a place as possible, and Mr. Crisp
is expected to do his part in suppressing it.
j Mills Is Expected to Fight,
This State of affairs can hardly be said to
be a matter of surprise, as it was predicted
by Mr. Mills and his managers in the event
that Mr. Crisp should be elected. No indi
cation has yet been given that the old Ways
and Means combination in the Fiftieth
Congress is prepared to quietly acquiesce in
the Springer-Crisp scheme, and the man
ner in which Breckinridge, WilsonBynum
and McMilhn held off leads to the supposi
tion that they will fight Mr. Mills is still
ill. This furnishes an excuse for his not
protesting at this time, but there are sundry
hints that he will renew the old fight for
free trade as soon as he resumes his position
on the floor.
Speaker Crisp will probably leave Wash
ington for a' few days, and go to some quiet
place, where he can secure a little rest:
which he greatly needs after the wear and
tear of his canvass and his incessant labors
since his election, and where he can also
work undisturbed on the arrangement of
the committees. He will not leave the city
until all the members of the Honse have
r hf d oppoHujwJy, to express , tljeir views to
him. He spent the day at his room at the
uapitol, and received a number or members.
Senators Hiscock and Chandler, ex-Speaker
Reed and others paid their respects.
The New Speaker's Strong Following.
The greatest interest in the present sit
uation lies in the speculation as to how
many followers Mills can command in op
position to Crisp and Springer, It will be
difficult for him to defeat any policy which
the Speaker may inaugurate, unless he can
create a reversal of feeling toward Crisp in
the large number of followers of the latter,
who are now praising every suggestion that
comes from the Speaker's room.
The conditions will be more favorable to
Mr. Mills after the holiday recess. Now
every Democrat is anxious to sscure a good
assignment, and the eulogies upon the new
Speaker can be heard all over the Capitol
building. When the committees are an
nounced there will be disappointment in all
directions. "Upon this expected disaffection
Mr. Mills can draw, and recruit the band
that is already prepared to take issue with
the Speaker in his attempt, to anchor the
tariff reform movement.
The effect of such a struggle is only im
portant to the Democratic party. Tariff
legislation at this time is out of the ques
tion, as the probabilitv of the Democratic
House and the Republican Senate uniting
on any measure is remote indeed, to say
nothing of the Presidental approval that
would be necessary.
Northwestern Becrnits for Free Trade.
However hopeless the aeht may be for
Mr. Mills, self-respect will compel him to
make it it he remains in the House. There
are others, less conspicuous, equally bound
to do business at the old free trade stand,
many of them being new members from the
Northwest who were elected on the assump
tion that they would stand by Mills and the
line of policy which he represents.
To belittle tariff reform and muzzle it as
an issue means the rejection of Cleveland as
the" next national candidate of the Democ
racy, and this is what the Crisp procramme
is supposed to be intended to accomplish.
Naturally, the admirers of Cleveland don't
intend to permit this to be done offhand,
and the battle that began in the caucus over
this issue will have its place airain as soon
as the new Ways and Means Committee is
organized and proceeds to work.
In his annual report, as published in The
'Dispatch, Secretary Foster calculates
that the revenues for the coming fiscal year,
from all sources, will aggregate $440,000,
000, while the sum total of estimated ex
penditures for the public service, according
to the President's message and Secretary's
report, is ?479,932,000. If, therefore, Con
gress should appropriate the public money
to the extent asked for in the estimates,
there would be prospectire deficiency in
the Treasury of 534,000,000, in addition to
whatever actual deficiency might exist at
present.
How Big Figures Can Be Juggled.
The requirements of the sinking fund
alone for the fiscal year 1893 reach f48,000,
000. If these requirements should be sus
pended and to suspend them would be
technically to violate law and custom
then there would be an apparent surplus of
$14,000,000 of revenues over the expendi
tures barrins. of course, whatever defi
ciency there may be now. But the estimates
for the fiscal year 1893 do not include a dol
lar for river and harbor work, upon which
the chief of engineers estimates that there
can be "profitably expended in the next
fiscal year the aggregate sum of $38,064,950.
The last session of Congress by legisla
tion authorized contracts to be entered: into
for certain river and harbor improvements,
fixing the total limit at ?11,331,779, for
which no money was then appropriated.
That Congress also authorized the construc
tion of certain public buildings at a cost of
more than 517,000,000, but failed to appro
priate therefor to the extent of 58,160,000,
and left this residue of necessary expen
diture as a legacy to future Congresses.
With reference to the river andharbor
work the Government by legislation has
and is now involved In contracts under
which contractors can sue and fix the lia
bility by judgment, and with reference to
these Tjuhlin hnildin?s Congress will have
either to suspend their construction or rise J

Sketch of the New Church Dignitary.
Philadelphia, Dec 11. Spate.
Official notice wa received f daV at the
archiepiscopal 'residence, on ' TJigfileenth
street, from Coadjutor,EIder, of Cincinnati,
of the appointment of Rev. Dr. Ignatius
F. Horstmann, Chancellor of the Archdio
cese of Philadelphia, as Bishop of Cleve
land, to succeed the late Bishop Gilmour,
who died some time ago in Florida, whither
he had gone for his health.
Dr. Horstmann has long been a conspicu
ous figure in the church in this city, and
has often been mentioned in connection
with an episcopal appointment. He was
for a long time pastor of Old St Mary's,
and has been Chancellor under Archbishop
Ryan. He is a man of commanding pres
ence, austere and very dignified, and is
very much esteemed, not only by those of
his own communion, but by leading citizens
of other denominations. He is a native of
Philadelphia and a graduate ot the Central
High School from which institution he
graduated with one of the hignest, if not
the highest, averages that any student ever
attained.
Dr. Horstmann, when seen at the arch
iepiscopal residence this evening, beyond
saying that he had received information of
his appointment as Bishop of Cleveland,
was averse to speaking further on the sub
ject, so the time of his consecration and his
leaving for his new charge could not be
ascertained.

A SENSATIONAL SUIT
Filed Against the Philadelphia Com
pany -by Attorney Stevenson.
IGHTING THE DEPOSIT DEMAND.
A Claim That $200,000 Is Being Used With
out Interest or Security.
THE ACTION A TERT IMPORTANT ONE
Yesterday afternoon an important pro
ceeding was commenced in Common Pleas
Court No. 3 against the Philadelphia Com
pany by M. M. Stevenson, Esq. Mr. Ste
venson is an attorney, and the suit is on
his own behalf. Last October he moved
into a residence, No. 514 Shady avenue,
East End, owned by Captain J. J. Vander
grift. - He used the gas of the Philadelphia
Company during October and November un
molested, paying his bills and receiving the
company's receipts for the same.
On December 5 the Pennsylvania Com
pany demanded that Mr. Stevenson sign an
application for gas. This was signed and
submitted to the company, but that corpora-,
tion refused to accept it unless Mr. Steven
son would deposit 530 to be held by them as
a continuing security.
A Demand Made for Jnterest,
Mr. Stevenson offered to deposit 530 if
theywould give security for its repayment,
and pay him interest at 6 per cent They
agreed to pay the interest, but refused to
give security. Mr. Stevenson was notified
that unless he would immedfately pay the
530 according to their rules his gas would be
turned off.
The bill in equity asks the Court to re
strain the company from turning off his gas.
It makes these statements:
Your orator is informed and expects to be
able to prove that the said company has
exacted from the consumers of Its natural
gas between $160,000 and $200,000, for tho
repayment of which said company is liable
on demand; that the business of said com
pany defendant is of a precarious naturo '
and of uncertain duration; that in addition
to the liability of said company for the pay
ment above named deposits the said c-
pany is heavily indebted otherwise, ana-'ra,
as your orator is advised, unable to pay Its
present Indebtedness.
Strong Allegations of Discrimination.
Your orator is informed and expects to be
able to prove that the custom or said com
pany (defendant) in regard to demanding
deposits in advance is uncertain, capricious,
unreasonable and oppressive; that the said
company furnishes gas to large numbers of
persons for private residences with out' re
quiring any security whatever; that to a
few of the many who have made, deposits
said company pays interest at the rate of
per cent per month, but that to the great
majority of depositors lc pays no interest
whatever.
Your orator avers that iiu said company
has no legal right to require of any cus
tomer a money deposit in advance and that
the custom of the aald company so to re
quire it is unjust and illegal.
In lieu of the 530 cash deposit, Mr.
Stevenson offered the company a bond In
the sum of 5100. duly indorsed by responsi
ble persons, as security for his gas bills
from month to month, but this bond the
company refused to accept Judge McClung
granted a writ which was served on the
Philadelphia Company officials last even
ing, and Tuesday next fixed for a hearing.
The case will excite much interest among
the thousands of gas consumers of the two
cities.

HIKERS ET A LIFE AND DEATH FIGHT
rSPICTSI. TZLIOBA1C TO TM DISPATCH.1
Beazil, IsD.r Dec 11. Following, on
the White Cap notices posted throughout
the Indiana coal region yesterday, a dyna
mite bomb was exploded in the Pratt mine,
a few miles north of here, early this morn
ing. The bomb was placed in a fan cylin
der, which was shattered to atoms. As a
consequence, the mine owned bv the Coal
Bluff Mining Company was shut down to
day, and operations cannot be resumed for
at least a week.
The mine in which the outrage occurred
was one of the few making an attempt to
run in the Indiana coal belt, as much to
give the striking miners a taste of their tem
per as anything else The operators scoured
the country for miners, and succeeded in
getting ten "blacklegs," who managed to
dig a few tons a day.
Many Similar Outrages Feared.
The doggedness of the latter in sticking to
their posts is regarded as having exasper
ated the strikers to the extent of moving
them to have recourse to dynamite, and
fears are entertained lest similar outrages
will occur if the other boycotted mine own
ers snould follow the example of the Coal
Bluff Company.
Had the bomb been exploded five minutes
sooner the night watchman would have been
blown into eternity. The watchman had
just inspected the air fans in the cylinder,
and laid his lantern close to the shaft,while
he went a few rods away for the key of the
toolhouse. The explosion felled him to the
earth, and sent his lantern and a goat, which
was grazing nearby, in fragments skyward.
It only needed this dynamite episode to
render the struggle pending between the
miners and the operators the most bitter in
the annals of mining troubles in this dis
trict. The Coal Barons Openly Denounced.
While the men generally repudiate all
illegal acts as calculated to ruin their cause
by estranging popular sympathy, they
are none the less violent in denun
ciation or the coal barons, who are
spoken of by the general public as richly
deserving the hardest things that can be
said of them. The barons make no conceal
ment of the fact that their policy is to com
pel the men to dig and delve fdr a paltry
pittance or take the only other alternative
which the circumstances of the situation
leave them to famish in their miserable
hovels.
Reports to the effect that the mines
are running notwithstanding the strike are
all false and are circulated by the operators
with the view of spreading demoralization
among the strikers. Every man of the
miners seems as if he were fighting a life-and-death
battle, and though the pri
vations the poor fellows are suf
fering are absolutely appalling, they are
facing the situation like heroes. Business
of all kinds is crippled in this region owing
to the strike, and for the first time since
they were started the two 'theaters in this
i were closed to-night.
A NIHILIST SPY FROM BOSTON.
Be Is Intrusted "With Private Dispatches for
Headquarters In Russia.
Boston; Dec 11. The Boston branch of
the Russian Section Nihilistic Society held
a meetinc last summer, when an agent was
selected to go upon a secret mission to
Russia. He was intrusted with some pri
vate dispatches and the sum of $C,000,
which he will deliver to headquarters in St
Petersburg. He was also given instructions
to bring bacC full details of the political
situation in.Russia.
The member selected is an exile and four
years ago was sent to Siberia, but was res
cued by this society. He left yesterday for
New York, where he will take a steamer to
Liverpool and thence to Hamburg, and
from there to one of the Russian frontiers,
where he will be met by an agent from the
headquarters at St Pe'tersburg, who will
guide him across to Russia.

Nobody had the slightest idea that such
misrepresentations as those sent to Amer
