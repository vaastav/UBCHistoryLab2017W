CEIVED IN HOUSE DEALING
WITH VARIED SUBJECTS.?
WOULD EXEMPT BONDS.
Washington-, Dec. 7.?Congress
reconvened today with the custo
mary brief and routine opening ses
sions which were attended by great
crowds and marked by an address,
in the senate by President-elect
Harding as a unique and historic
feature. Senatofr Harding took his
seat, answered his name when the:
senate roll was called and made a
brief address from the rostrum.
Other features of the opening of
the third and final session of the
Sixty-sixth congress were receipt of
annual appropriation estimates ag
gregating $4,653,000,000 and intro
ductoin in the house of an unusual
volume of new bills and resolutions.
Senators held up their bills until
tomorrow in accordance with the
custom of limiting the^Brst day to
formal convocation.
The principal business of today's
sessions was to arrange for receipt
tomorrow of President Wilson's
opening message. A joint committee
called upon the president at the
White House and the latter receiv
ing them in the Blue room told them
he would "have " a communication"
tomorrow. He did not state whether
he would send or read his message,
but it was understflad that the form
er course would be pursued.
To Start at Noon
The senate was in session 25 min
utes and the house, notwithstanding
its longer roll call, only twice as
long. New members elected last
November to frll vacancies were
sworn in and adjournment taken
until oon, tomorrow, when both
bodies plan, after receiving the
president's message, to proceed to
work.
As "usual the senate session pro
ceeded with dignified calm and the
house with boisterous confusion.
The latter's roll call was taken amid
a bedlam of feliicitations of return
ing members and conversation of
members and spectators.
Galleries of both bodies were
jammed and thousands of persons
stood in the halls to catch glimpses
and -sounds of the proceeding with
in. About the capitol, conferences
of party leaders, cafe dinner parties
and surging crowds in the corridors
furnished other opening session at
mosphere. i
The program for tomorrow's/ in
auguration of actual work called for
debate in the senate on the bill for
federal regulation of the meat in
dustry and for the launching of im
migration Restriction legislation in
the house. The house immigration
committee bill prohibiting immigra
tion for two years was reported out
today and the rules committee to
morrow will consider a rule for its
immediate consideration under limi
tation of debate.
New Bill Come In
More than 350 new bills and reso
lutions were dropped in the hopper
today and a flood of similar propo
sitions is expected tomorrow in the
senate. The new house measures
dealt with almost every conceivable
? * * i' i
suDjecc, including proposals ior re-i
peal of war laws, for appropriations!
of milions of dollars for a myriad]
of purposes, pensions and many
measures for farmers' relief.
Committees of both senate and
house are to begin work immediate
ly on the measures left on their cal
endars from preceding sessions and
on the new grist. Calls for numer
out committee meetings this week
were issued by chairman today, but
leaders said that the regular appro
priation bills would have the right
of way. They added that it was
hoped to pass all of the appropria
tion bills before March 4, but that

OMINOUS SHADOW OF SENATOR
PENROSE INTERVENES?FIRST
MOVE FAILS?JOINT RESOLU
TION TO REVIVE WAR Fl
NANCE CORPORATION PRAC
TICALLY LOST
Washington, Dec. 7.?The ominous
shadow of Senator Penrose fali ng
athwart the senate chamber this
morning dimmed the roseate promise
of governmental aid to the Strieker
farmers of the South and West.
The Republican "boss" while ab
sent, expressed himself through those
lieutenants who in the recent cam
paign comprised the "senatorial oli
garchy." These succeeded in relegat
ir.g to an indefinite state from whlcl
it may be recalled only by unanimous
consent the joint resolution calcu
lated to resurrect the war finance
corporation, and so liberalize the fed
eral reserve system that farmer:
could Obtain necessary funds re'adilj
and at reasonable interes?/rates.
Senator Lodge objected to the con
sideration of the resolution because
it was not broad enough to include
the mills of New England, which he
declared to be distressed to an extenl
equal to that of the farmers' . dis
tress. Senator Frelinghuysen object
ed,because of his contention that the
revival of the war finance corpora
tion would necessitate a bond issue
oi Jfl,uuu,uuu,uuu wnicn wouia iurcn
er inflate the national currency. Sen
ator Watson acting chairman of th<
finance comittee and Senator Smool
an astute leader of the "Old Guard/
stood ready to assist in jockeying
the resolution into such position'thai
it could gain its feet again only bj
the most strenuous efforts. Senatoi
Glass of Virginia further contributec
to the discomfiture of the farmers
friends by declaring against the ef
lort to change the policy of the fed
eral reserve system. It was his poinl
that if the resolution prevailed, il
would transform the system from ?
reserve to a speculative system.
The Glass contribution impresses
the friends of the resolution with ar
idea that they had orreds in stateg}
when they attempted to rectify twt
institutions by a single move.
While the developments of the daj
revealed unsuspected opposition. th(
friends of the farmers. prepared t.
renew the combat. Representative
Byrnes of South Carolina, pointing
out the fact that his resolution re
'erred solely to the war finance cor
povaljon and not to the federal re
'jcrve system, lobbied with succes;
imor,^ influential Republicans of tht
Iiorse.
Representative Stegell of Alabama
to meet the objection of ' Senatoi
Lodge presented a new resolutioi
under the terms of which the wai
finance corporation would extend ait
not only to farmers but to marufac
turers.
Senator Harris of Georgia, iv'thou
regard to the war finance corpora
lion, proceeded through an indopend
ent Ti;ove against the federal reserv
board. His measure would limit th<
rate of interest to be charge i mem
ber banks to 5 per cent.
Despite these moves, in an effort t<
regain lost ground, the prospects ar<
admittedly less bright than yestar
day. The opposition of Senator Pen
rose and his lieutenants will be, it i:
confessed, a difficult opposition t<
overcome.

Memphis, Tenn., Dec. 7?Measures
to make effective 50 per cent reduc
tion in the acreage planted in cotton
and a similar increase.in the acreage
devoted to food crops and live stock
raising were under consideration at
a meeting here today* of representa
tives of banking, commercial and far

states.
Leaders in the movement declare
that action to be taken at the meeting
would insure a cut of at least one half
in cotton acreage next year which,
they declare, imperative as a means
of stabilizing the market and to re
store the price to a figure that will
give the farmer a reasonable return
for the 1921 crop.

COTTON DOWN AGAIN
The cottoA market was disaD
pointing to the bulls aggjn today.
I After losing some 45 points at yes
terday's close, the market opened
l' this morning at a further decline, j
and ruled lowgr all day, the closing
. figures being about 25 points down
from yesterday's close. January fu
tures closed at 15.72 against 15.93
( yesterday. Spots in New York and
New Orleans were down 25 points.
t No cotton was offered on the lo
, cal market today. The price offered
was about as yesterday, 16 1-2
' cents for good cotton, with 17 for
fancy cotton.
, The government ginners' figures
were announced at 11 o'clock. The
amount of cotton ginned to Decem
( ber 1st., was 10,144,321 against 8,
844,368 to the same period lest
, year. The amount of cotton ginned
in the period since the last report
' was about the same as that ginned
in the same period last year.
The failure to secure any relief
, by legislation and the announce
. ment that the French spinners were
, going on a three day a week pro
, gram had a depressing influence on
the market.

WILSON DISCUSSES
HOME PROBLEMS
r.
PRESIDENT URGES NATIONAL
ECONOMY A BUDGET AND
REVISION OF TAX LAWS
ASKS FOR A LOAN TO AR
MENIA. WOULD FREE PHILIP- '
PINE ISLANDS '
Washington, Dec. 7.?President
Wilson's concrete recommendations (
to Congress in his annual message
today were:
Revision of the tax laws with sim- .
plification of the income and profits
taxes. Independence for the Philip
pines.
A loan to Armenia.
Economy in government appro
priations and expenditures and el
ation of a "workable!' budget sys
tem. * v
Cold storage and other laws af
fecting thee ost of living, and the
Federal licensing of corporations as
recommended in previous messages.
Rehabilitation and training of dis
able soldieirs and sailors. The Pres- ' -v,
ident did not endorse a bonus.
Nowhere did the President refer
to the League of Nations of the
peace treaty fight. Except perhaps
by inference in his opening when he
quoted Abroham Lincoln's "let us
have faith that right makes might,
and in that faith let us dare to do
our duty as we understand it."
At its close the President wrote
a paragraph which might be regard
ed as a valedictory saying:
"I have not so much laid before
you a series of (recommendations as
sought to utter a confession of
faith, of the faith in which I was
bred and whichtit is my solemn pur
pose to stand by until my last fight
ing day. I believe this to be the
faith of America, the faith of the
future and of all the victories which
await national action in the days to
come, whether in America or eisy
where.
Democracy, the President said, "is
being put upon its final test.
"The old world," said he "is just
now suffering from a wanton rejec
tion of the principle of democracy
and a substitution of the principle .
of autocracy' as asserted in ' the
name but without the authority and
sanction of the mult.wude. This is
the time of all others when demo
ciracy should prove its purity and
its spiritual power to prevail. It is
surely the manifest destiny of the
United States to lead in the attempt
to make this spirit prevail.
Two ways " in which the United
States can assist to accomplish this
grreat object" were outlined by the
President. They were:
"First: By offering the example
vrahin her own borders of the will
and power of Democracy to make
and enforce laws which are unques
tionably just and which aire equal in
their administration.
"Second: By standing for right
and justice as 'towards individual
nations.
The President sent the message
by a messengofr, deciding not to
read it in person.
MISTAKE IN ADVERTISEMENT
In the big advertisement of Park
er & Reese in Mondays Press and Ban
ner all hats are advertised as of the
Jno. B. Stetson make. This was a
mistake due to a misreading of the
copy. All hats at $6.00 and under are
not of the Jno. B. Stetson make. All
over that are of that make.
A similar mistake is made with re
gard to socks. All socks are advertis
ed as silk socks. Those under $1.00
are not of silk, while those over that
amount are of silk.
The Press and Banner regrets that
this error crept into the advertise
ment, but it is one of the mistakes
which happen. However, those peo
ple who have gone to Parker and
Reese's in response to the advertise
ment have not been disappointed.
They have bought bargains better
than the advertisement indicated.
They are still offering untold bar
gains.
