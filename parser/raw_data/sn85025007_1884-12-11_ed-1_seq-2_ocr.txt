ALEXANDRIA, VA.
THURSDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 11.
THE INCREASE OF crime in this country,
and from what we can learn in everyother,
continues, it seems, to an alarming
Of late years it has been impossible to
glance over a newspaper without having
one's sensibilities shocked or nerves un
strung at some horrible rectal of Woodshed
or heineous violation of innocence, and in
many cases, too, narrated id a manneunfit
for delicate ears. In one issue alone (last
Tuesday's) of a leading paper of this coun
try the accounts of murders, assaults, sui
cides and other species of crime exceedec
every other feature of the journal. Among
tbe most flagrant might ba cited, first, a
horrible case of infanticide which occurred
in New York. A policeman while walking
his beat on what is known as Pleasant
avenue, kicked against what be supposed
to be a bundle of rags. It appearing heavy,
however, he picked it up and found the
parcel to be wrapped in paper, but quic J
dropped the same upon feeling a warm
liquid course over his hands. At that in
stant the moon burst from behind a cloud
bank, and by her beams the conservator of
the peace discovered the ghastliness of the
bundle?an innocent babe, not then cold,
with its head almost severed from the body.
Horrible as is such a crime?murdering in
cold blood an innocent offspring?it is one
by no means uucommon in large cities, it
being in no way surprising to drivers of
garbage carts in New York to find bodies
of dead infants in slop and ash barrels. The
crime of infanticide is, of course, occasion
ally committed in smaller places. Even
oar own, as a general thing quiet, commu
nity has had fiends in it at tirades who per
formed the same terrible deed,'and old l'o
tomachas more than once cast upon its
shores the mutilated romains of what bad
once been a living, guileless infant, who by
the act of an unnatural parent had been
forced to join the ranks of those whom we
are assured compose in a great measure the
kingdom of heaven. But, to pass on : The
n ?xt revolting case mentioned in the issue
of the paper alluded to was that of a four
year-old girl-child lisping her evidence in a
Chicago court against two young men at
whose bands she had suffered nameless evil.
Then follows an affray iu Chattanooga be
tween two men rivals for the affections of a
lady, in which both were killed ; then an
attempt on the part of train robbers to
wreck a heavily-laden passenger train, in
no way concerned as to tbe number thut
might be killed or crippled so a large booty
was secured \ then the bloody endeavor ol a
man in Buffalo to eviscerate a companion ;
the firing of a residence iu Raleigh, N. C.,
by a disgruntled negro servant ; the murdei
of an old man and his son by a man iu
Port Jervis, N. Y., with whom the couple
were bargaining for tbe sale of a horse ; the
assassination of the principal wituess in a
murder case at Galena, Kan., by a brothei
of the culprit; together with several other
murderous affrays in different parts of the
country. Suicides and attempts at the same
are so frequent in the larger cities that but
small space is devoted to such items. There
? is hardly a day that the East river fails to
force to its surface the blackened and bloat
ed corpse of some individual who by his
own rash act had launched himselt into the
unseen world. To show the desperation of
some of such characters when bent on self
destruction the case of a despoudent New
York tailor is cited. The man in question,
growing weary of his monotonous calling,
took seven boxes of matches and, scraping
off the heads, made a mixed drink of sul
phur and water and swallowed the same.
Not dying quick enough, he saturated his
clothing thoroughly with coal oil, applied a
light to the same and sitting down awaited
the final moment when, as be supposed, he
would be transported from further sorrow
and tribulation through the medium of fire.
His plight, however, was discovered by the
neighbors, the would-be suicide rolled in
carpets, which smothered tbe tiames, and
with the aid of a stomach pump he was
forced to disgorge his deadly potion. It is
a orime in New York to attempt self
destruction; it has become a common thing
for police justices in that city to have indi
viduals before them for no other offence
than that of attempted suicide. In the face
of such a ghastly array of every day occur
rences, the question, Is the world retro
grading to antediluvian days ? is a pertinent
one.
Washington, in his Farewell Address to
the people of the country, was careful to
warn them against the dangers of foreign
entanglements. Since that time, until the
Arthur administration, his wise advice was
followed, with the happiest result. But the
republicans, under Mr. Arthur, could not
let well enough alone, but set that advice
at defiance, and sent representatives to the
Congo conference, who took part in that con
ference, thereby not only binding thiscountry
to its decision, but establishing a precedent
for other similar conferences, the result of
which may be the overthrow of the Monroe
doctrine, or wars to enforce that doctrine.
The people of the country may well be
gratulated upon the fact that the days
during which the republican party can run
them into further silly and unnecessary
dangers are numbered.
President Arthur recommended a pen
sion for Gen. Grant and Senator Mitchell,
with excessive previousness, embodied that
recommendation in a bill. As the adoption
of the recommendation, however, would
have prevented the General's restoration
to his rank and pa)' in the army, the latter
being more than three times the amount of
the pension, the General regrets their in
terference in bis affairs, hoping for, and
being likely to receive, more substantial
benefits from the democrats. He has thus
taught his superservicable friends a lesson
in the art of thinking before speaking.
No wondkr Attorney-General Brewster
refuses to supply information concerning
the business of his department, when he
knows so little about that business that
be declares, as he recently did, that his de
partment never had the question of the
title to the Aqueduct Bridge at Georgetown
referred to it; though a report upon that
question bad been made by his department,
aod, what's more, was signed by himself.
Poor old furbelow! The only things he
does well are to pay George Bliss$100 aday
and expenses to prevent the conviction oi
the star routers, and to endorse Blaine's
bloody shirt speeches.
Thrre 19 a cood deal of talk about the
necessity the democrats are under to repeal
the statute providiog for the appointment
of deputy mardhals, in order to preserve
their reputation for consistency. But the
exigency is such that in this matter the
democrats will do well to follow the pre
cedent set them by the republicans, and to
act upou the formula of Mr. Raum, 'that
modern politicians can't afford to be con
sistent." Senator Vest is right when he eays
the statute referred to should not be re
pealed now.
The republicans in many parts of the
North are expelling men from their party
for not votiug for Blaine. Nothing of the
sort could be done iu Virginia ; for, with one
or two honorable exceptions, every republi
can in the whole State walked up to the
polls and voted for Blaine, though to do so
they had to stultify themselves by voting for
General Mabone's electors, who, with two
exceptions, were democratic scalawags who
endorsed Mr. Wise's assertion that Southern
republicans ore "apostates for the price of
their apostacy."
Some of the newspapers are applauding
General Grant for declining a pension and
thereby delayiog the establishment of a civ
il pension list. They don't know the Gen
eral. The only two things he ever declined
were, a live alligator, which would have
been a white elephant, and the pension re
ferred to ;. but he declined the latter be
cause while it was only tive thousand a
year, he was assured that Congress intend
ed to put him on the retired list at seven
teen thousand.
Senator Riddleberger is reported as
sn \ ing that ''respect for his constituents
urge-i him to oppose the confirmation of
Secretary McCulloch." It Mr. Riddle
berger means by his constituents the repu
table white people of Virginia, his remark
will lie the first iutimation they ever bad
that be has any respcct for them. That
they urge him to oppose the Secretary's
confirmation is, of course, iucorrect.
Low indeed must General Butler have
fallen when his Virgiuia pal derides and
reviles him. The latter, by the band of his
amanueu^i'', compares the Butlerites of
Massachusetts to the James brothers of
Missouri.
Sherman Wriggling.
General Sherman, in reply to a question
as to whether or not he intended to reply to
the letter of Mr. Davis, recently published,
said he might do so at some future time,
but he should consult his own convenience;
that Mr Davis had not addressed him, but
the St. Louis Republican, and that if he
roaJe any reply it could ouly be through
the War Department. He further said he
did not suppose that any reporter was at
the meetiug of Frank Blair Post on the
night ho spoke, as the Grand Army is an
organization ouly for the social interchange
of personal memories Still, he admitted
that the reports published contained much
of the truth, but not all. He has moat of
his Louisiana papers, he said, to make good
bis assertion that the civil war was forced
upon the people of Louisiana by conspira
tors in Washington; and that during the
progress of the war Mr. Davis changed his
views of the doctrine of secession, and
threatened to use force in case any State of
the Confederacy should attempt what was
theu knowu as "separate State action."
Sherman has already sent to Washington
some letters and papers bearing on the
case, but as to their publication, he stated
that the authorities there must be con
sulted.

General Manager Rives says in his report;
"In view of the fact that several of the
largest railroad systems in the southern
States are contemplating a change of guage
from five feet to four feet nine inches, pre
parations have been made and are making
which will enable us to take similar action
with the maxium economy at the proper
time. I am satisfied that such change,
when accomplished, will result in an in
crease of business and reduction of expen
ses."

[Bpocixl Oorrospoudenoe of the Alexandria Uazeite. |
Washington. D. C., Dec. 11, 1884.
" Congressman Hewitt, of Alabama, who is
in charge of tbe Mexican pensions bill, says
the passage of that bill at the present ses
sion of Congress will be impossible, for the
reason that though the democrats are in fa
vor of giving a pension to the survivors of
the Mexican war, they can not support the
Senate amendment to the bill, which prac
tically pensions any man whose name was
on the rolls of the federal army during tbe
civil war. The republicans in the Senate
knew this amendment would kill the
bill, and for that reason adopted it. The
republican caucus, as a cheap means
by which to make party capital, re
solved last night to attempt to secure
tbe passage of the bill as amended. The
democrats will try to have the objectiona
ble amendment stricken out, or to compro
mise upon a bill less objectionable, but
both efforts will be resisted by the repub
licans, because most of tho survivqr? of the
Mexican war live in the South, aud, there
fore, as Messrs. Hewitt aud Buckner say,
the passage of the bill at this, or at any ear
ly future session is by no means probable.
The prevalent belief to-day respecting
the new treaties is that none of them will
be made effective at this session of Congress
for the reason that the democrats will op
pose them because tbey want to give the
new administration a clear held, aud uot to
interfere with its policy, and because the
treaties are in favor of the manufacturers
and not the farmers. Tbe resolution for
debating the Spanish treaty in open session
of the Senate, will, it is reported, be advo
cated by the friends of the administration.
It is learned that the new Nicaraguan trea
ty, providing for an inter oceanic canal,
gives great popular offense in France, for
the reason that should the proposed canal
be built it will depreciate the value of the
stock of the Panama canal, which was a
popular loan in that country, aud that prob
ably France may on that account protest
against the confirmation of the treaty.
A democratic member of the Seuate when
asked by tbe Gazette's correspondent this
morning if Mr. Kiddleberger had any back
ing in his opposition to the coufirmatiou oi
the nomination of Mr. McCulloch for the
position of Secretary of the Treasury, said
he had not heard that matter discussed, but
that he did not suppose he had ; that Kid
dleberger didn't seem to have any inllueuce
iu other matters, aud that he thought he was
making a fool of himself, which any member,
under the rules, had a right to do. He said
he thought Riddlebergers vote would be
the only one against tho coufirmatiou, but
that it was noue of their, the democrats',
fight, and be had really paid very little at
tention to it.
The Springer committee resumed its ses
sions this moruing. They had before them
as a witness Barker, the Treasury clerk,
who testified under oath to tba same charge?
be had previously made to the committee,
which are that tho aocounts of officers in
the Department of Justice were fraudulent,
and that though Comptroler Lawrence ol
the Treasury knew them to be so, because
he, Barker, had told him, he yet ordered
them to be paid.
Senator Joe Brown, of Georgia, upou be
ing shown the report of an interview with
Mr. Bayard in a newspaper this morning,
in which the Delaware Senator said the
Southern policy of the Cleveland adminis
tration would be in the lino of that ad
vocated by such men as Hampton, of South
Carolina, and Colquit and Gordon, of Geor
gia, quietly remarked that there were other
men in the l^outh whose views and opinions,
he thought, were as deserving of as much
of President Cleveland's consideration as
thoso of the gentlemen named.
At the national conference of health
boards this morning delegates made reports
of the sanitary condition of their
respective cities. Mr. Brooks said New
York and Brooklyn were prepared to prevent
the introduction of cholera. Some of tbe
delegates took strong ground Hgaiust the
use of well and cistern waters in cities. Dr.
Germer, of Erie, did not believe in disin
fectants, saying "you might just as well
have a prayer meeting againstgrasshoppers."
Dr. J. G. Campbol), of Richmond, Va., said
that the death rate among tbe colored popu
lation was so large as to excite the pity and
commiseration of a whole community. He
attributed it,not to constiiution;il peculiarity
but to poverty. The negroes, be said, con
sidering the circumstances iu which they
became freemen, bad doue remaiknbly weil
and he was satisfied that in future the mor
tality among them would be less. Dr.
Reeves representing the West Virginia
State board, advocated the appointment of
women as house to house inspectors, as
they were very appreciative aud would find
a great many defects that men overlooked.
Dr. Carson reported that be had gone to the
scene of the late reported scourge iu Vir
ginia and Kentucky, that that disease was
epidemce dysentery caused by malaria; that
the fatal cases occurred because those who
were attacked did not believe iu doctors;
that the death rate was low, and that the
people there were agrieved at the exagger
ated reports.
The full text of the Spanish treaty togeth
er with the President's message of transmit
tal is published in the Congressional Jtccurd

ate, the official returns of the electoral vote
of Virginia.

Mr. Vest opposed the project of dividing
the Territory as unnecessary. The par;

A Fatal Meteorite.-?The aerolite,
which, according to a telegram from .Hot
Spring*, Ark., instantly killed a farmer near
that place recently, was probably a fragment
of a large meteor. The report states that
the meteorite descended through a tall tree,
cutting the limb off as clean as a cannon
hall would have done. It is not often that
fatal results follow from the fall ofa sporad
ic meteor. The average weight of-nine hun
dred and fifty such stones picked up and
preserved in the Paris Museum is less than
two aud a-half ounces, and it is in extreme
ca'es only that they peuetrate the ground
more than two or three feet. Fortunatelj', |
the stonj' masses fly from distant space into
our atmosphere move with a "demoniacal
impetuosity," as Prof. Ball calls it, to which
the earth owes its safety. On the memora

came straight at the earth the meteoric tem
pest became really awful. But of all the
myriads of shooting stars which then bom
barded our plauet not a single particle, Recording
to the highest astronomical authority, has ever
been recovered, the fiery masses having been sud
detily reduced in the resisting medium of the at
mosphere to harmless vap r, But this is not al
ways the ca=e with large, stony meteorites, which

warm except on the surface, showing that their

the air, while the interior ( the rigid mass bein* a
poor conductor of heat) retains something of "the
cold of spaco." As the celestial projectile enters
our lower atmosphere its velocity niu-.t be so
much lessened that it would seem possible for a
man watching its trail of fireand its line of tlight
to elude its fatal stroke.?-V. Herald.

Coliunbus Railroad, near Enon. A monster
jaguar escaped from its ca^e and was not
heard from by the owner, J. L. Sboemate,
until morning. The beast fled rapidly across
the couutry, alarming persons who were up
late, stampeding cattle, wounding many of
them and killiug and sucking the blood of
others. About midnight the beast bad
reached the vicinity of Dryden's Mills, five
miles south of Dayton, where Wm. Lesher, a
farmer, was awakened by a great commo
tion in his hog pen. Having got a gun and
lantern, he, with a neighbor, went to the
pen, where they found one dead hog and
the jaguar killinganother. Lesher shot the
animal in the hind part. It jumped at the
men and chased them into the house; it
then drank and lied down the turnpike.
The whole country was alarmed, and one
hundred inen with rifles searched all night.
At daylight, in answer to two women, who
made signals of distress, the men hastened
to their relief, and found the jaguar in an
outhouse, where they shot it dead.
