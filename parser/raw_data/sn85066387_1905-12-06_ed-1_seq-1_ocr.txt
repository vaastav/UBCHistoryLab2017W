BANNERMAN
IN SADDLE
IN ENGLAND
Made Premier and
Will Form New
Cabinet.
Liberal Leader to Urge
Peace, Retrenchment
and Reform
Ss>«ci«.l Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Dec s.— Moderate Liberalism
assumed control of the British empire
when Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman ac
cepted the Premiership from the hands
of Kin^ Edward this morning:. The new
Prime Minister** Cabinet "will be formed
on the7p*flhC!2>??»of uritlng »ll pluses of
Liberal opinion In support of peace, re
trenchment and reform. The Liberal im
perialists, as ' led by men of the Rose
bery type; the old-fashioned Liberals,
like Jonn Morley and James Bryce: the
militant Radicals, whose hero is David
Lloyd-George — all will have their due
share of representation in Sir Henry's
Ministry.
The Government, as thus organized,
can move along moderate lines, aa any
attempt to force the pace In the matter
of home rule for Ireland would drive the
Liberal Imperialists out of the Cabinet
and defeat its master. It will b« the im
mediate aim of the Liberal party to hold
the fort against protection. On the other
hand, the disposition on the part of the
liberal imperialists to convert the party
of Gladstone into a Unionist organiza
tion permanently would send the extreme
Radicals into the hostile camp.
It happens, therefore, that the men
•whom Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
has gathered about him agree first to
stand solidly against the Chamberlain
party of protection, and to press forward
v, ith important measures for reform in
Great Britain; then, using what public
support, they have gained on this side of
St. Ck-orges Channel, to give Ireland
what Sir Henry styles "effective man
agement of Its own don-.estic affairs."
The Irish leaders persevere in the
rtrongeet possible statement of their de
mands, but the Campbell-Bannerman
Government believes that they will not
refuse to recognize the necessity under
which the Liberal party will labor to win
the support of the British electorate be
fore there can be the slightest possibility
of securing home rule for Ireland.
John Redmond has already been no
tified from various sources that the
House of Lords is prepared to kill any
home rule bill which may 1* sent up to it
and to subject any such "revolutionary
proposal" to referendum.
Joseph Chamberlain's secretary to-day
said: "We are prepared to plunge into
the electoral campaign at once. Our bat
tle cry will be "Preferential treatment of
the colonies for imperial purposes.* We
will make the stiffest possible fight
against the disruption of the United
Kingdom."
The Duke of Devonshire, Liberal Union
ist, former Lord President of the Coun
c'L was among the callers on the new
Premier before the latter went to the
palace and in political circles importance
is attached to the visit, as possibly signi
fying some kind of working«agreement on
certain points of policy between the anti
protectionist Unionists, of which the
Duke has been the recognized leader
since bis secession from the Balfour Cab
inet, and the new Government.
The following official announcement was
made to-night:
Sir Henry Ckrapbell-B*nnennan lnforni#<l
King; Edward that he would be enable to sub
mit bU proposed arrangements in connection
with the formation of a new Government until
December 11. Kins Edward left London this
afternoon to Tislt Lord Arlington at Crlchel,

LONDON. Dec. 6.— The Chronicle's

"Podwtilocsyska, a town on the

Kharkoff, • Voronezh and other -_'.l South.

The Telegraph's correspondent at St.
Petersburg, telegraphing under date of
ilonday, says:
"The fateful question with , which
Russia is now confronted 'is whether
the nation will await the election of the
legislative assembly or help anarchy
to victory. The Cabinet was formed
for the purpose of putting into
the hands of a national assembly, and
if it cannot accomplish this it will re
sign. Theaim of the revolutionists is
to compel 'the Cabinet " to create a se
ries of accomplished facts, • modifying
the manifesto of October 30, which the
Douma shall then be unable to alter.
Thus, they demand a set of temporary
measures, such as equal rights . for all
citizens, which, if granted, .would, by
their very . nature, be not temporary;
but definitive and immutable.
"If the Jewish disabilities are thus
removed by a new ministerial' act anti-
Jewish riots, accompanied by .awful
massacres, would inevitably follow, be
cause the people : .would: resent' any
usurpation by the Ministers of power
belonging only to the' nation and the
Czar. Hence -the Government -is ex
tremely desirous of bringing the Dou
:na together and great haste is now be
ing made to frame an electoral law.
"Probably , an electoral - bill, based
upon universal but not secret suffrage
will be adopted by the' Cabinet, which
is now meeting in council. Assuming:
that the Czar assents, strenuous efforts
will be made to get the Douma ; to
gether by March 6, the anniversary of
the emancipation of' the serfs. The
danger of serious disorders within is
great Indeed. *
