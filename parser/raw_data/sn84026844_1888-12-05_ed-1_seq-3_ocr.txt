Free Salt Would Sliuply Uonefll the Grant
English null Trust.
The English suit combine or salt trust,
is composed of sixty-four suit producing
firms and companies with a capital of
?2,000,000 common, ?1,000,000 preference
stock to draw seven per cent interest
and ?1,000,000 four and one half per
cent bonds, making a total of about
$20,000,000. Iu their prospectus they
state that from 1878 to 1887, 10,894,880
tons were shipped in the Mercey. Of
that amount 2,235,567 tons were shipped
to the United States. The cstimuted
production of the nult combine unnually
18 2,000,001). The profit at five shillings
per ton ?300,000. After paying interest
on bonds ?45,000, and preference shares
?70,000??115,000?leaves ?385,000, or
$1,UL'5,000 pro Jit annually. The above
calculation would give from sixty to
seventy per cent profit on the cost of
manufacturing the salt.
Now why should not this country admit
salt free of duty to benefit this huge
"combine" and breakdown our own salt
manufacturers? "It's English, you
know." Free traders wake up! Your
friends want our market without being
taxed for it. "The tariff is u tax." so
the parrot says. Mr. Allison, in your
tariff bill remember the poor English
salt trust. '
Retaliation.
There is an instructive story told in
the Massachusetts Ploughman of the now
notorious Sackville West: Twenty
years ago in Ireland a young lad by the
name of John Boyle O'Reilly, while
training and swearing a regiment of his
countrymen to fealty to their country,
ind to light for it at the right time, was
jet rayed, arrested, and banished to Aus
num. uue 01 liiu coun ? im uumnm-u
liim was Lionel Saekville West. O'lteilly
was shipped to Australia, but escaped
it sea, at great rink, in an open boat, but
tvas picked up by an American whaler
tnd brought to America, and is now
widely known a* a poet, patriot and
itateaman. Hut, like Cleveland, be was
n favor of retaliation. When Lord
sackville Wct-t advised his countrymen,
hrough Murchison, to vote for Oleveaud
to aid the "mother country,"
J'Heilly went to Washington and urged
lie President to send West home. He
:onvinccd Mr. Cleveland, and O'lleilly
luccecded in banishing West from
Vuierica, in retaliation for West banish*
ng O'Keilly from Ireland.

nouth of Black Water Fork. She can
mndle a Winchester with the dexterity

ivith two rides and a bear trap strapped
:o her back and followed by six dogs.
She ran three miles to a point where
the thought a deer in full chase would
;ross, and she got there in time to see
Iter hucband kill him. She is a big,
Idaek-haired woman, very industrious,
ivith a heart as big as her foot, and she
s the mother of seven children. She is
not pretty. A few months ago, for a

Mr. John A. Beard, of Anthony's
creek, this county, hadouite an exciting
adventure with an old buck* last week,
lie attempted the rescue of his dog,
which was trying conclusions with the
deer, when he ran up and gave the deer
a severe kick. This only brought his
buck8hip's vengeance down on himself.
Mr. Heard saved himself by his extraordiary
running abilities and gutting on
lop of a high fence, from which position
ho was rescued by u friend who was near.
The deer was one of the largest of bis
kiud, having seven points to the beam,
and weighing, when dressed, 148 pounds.

THE PKES8 ASP T1IE JIESSAUB.
Various Vinwa Takrn of Mr. Cleveland's
Passionate Uttrrunces.
New York, Dec. 4.?The Sun in its
editorial comments on the President's
message, says: The main fuct is that nowhere
does Mr. Cleveland specify or
even suggest any line of policy to be pursued
in dealing with the question of the
surplus and the taxes.
The Heraldmys: It is a plain, business
like report of the condition of the various
departments, perfucedjby a few para?[raphs
in which Mr. Cleveland speaks
or more impartial laws and a stricter
adherence to the constitutional methods;
that monopolies and trusts shall not inor.muu
lta?? that all Anuii-ii'iinunlinll hnv?
a fair chance in the race of life. What
be says on thin head is sensible and well
put, but as the people have just elected
to power a party which favors monopolies,
trusts and capitalistic combinations,
for the present the recent elections show
that the people do not care enough about
its evils.
The Tribune Buys: The message is not
as carefully written as the President's
other official papers, but its crude or
awkwurd phrases count for nothing in
comparison with its mischievous tone.
It would not be out of place for the Senate's
reply to rebuke a Chief Magistrate
who sets himself to inflame blind prejudice
and passion against employers generally,
whatever their personal worth or
merit, und against the institutions and
laws which the people huve recently
sustained by their verdict. Mr. Cleveland
gained a reputation for courage
when no cut through disguises ami avowed
for Free Trade; but he does not guin
in any respect when he gives vent to
personal passion in his lust unnual message.
The Timet says: The whole tenor and
| important truth lying at the buso of
some of Mr. Cleveland's remarks are, in
our judgment, somewhat obscured by
I overstatement. It is pretty true that
| some of the higher protective duties of
tariil foster monopoly, levy taxes, not
for the common needs but for the benefit
of a privileged class, and imposing
gross inequality upon people, but the
class benefitted issmull. It does not include
all or even the greater number of
manufacturers. On the contrary the
great body of manufacturers sufler by
tho taxes that enrich the few, being
compelled to pay them the cost of mate- '
rials made by the few.
A PJjAKFUJ* ACCIDENT.
T\?o Hoja Whirled Fifty Tlmen Around a 1
Clay County Star.
About the last days of October, u blood
curdling accident occurred at thu mill of ,
J. M. Hoggs,this county, which has
lately been reported to us as follows: J
A boy named Douglass, who had come 1
to mill, was standing near a rapidly re- <
volving iron shaft, when another boy ,
named Young, who was standing near, '
slipped behind him aud catching up the :
tail of his oil-cloth overcoat, wrapped it
around the shaft. It was instantly
drawn tight by the revolvingof the shaft, y
and Douglass was wound in, catching
Young as he went, both hoys were
whirled fifty or more times around tho i
shaft at lightning speed. Douglass' legs -s
were both broken above the knees, and (
his thigh boues sticking out through .1
the llesli were heard to strike several
times against a post that stood near. '
Young was also severely hurt, having re- J
ceived a crushed foot and broken arm. j
Dr. J. M. Waugh, who is waiting on
Dougluss, has set his legs and thinks
one of theui may be saved, but states
that the other will likely have to be
amputated if he recoverssullicienily to f
admit of the operation. The Doctor
believes that ho will lecover. I

Ilnllrnari Stock Tlint U Taxable.
Cincinnati, 0., Dec. 4.?Judge Peck,
of the Superior Court, on au application
by a holder of Dayton & Michigan railroad
preferred stock for an injunction
preventing tho collection of tax by the
county officers, has decided that the
stock is taxable. Tho certificates of
stock, he says, guarantee regular dividends
to holders. This guarantee is secured
by mortgage. The holders of this
stock do not have tho right to vote. The
court, therefore, holds that thfcy aro not
stockholders but. creditors of the road,
and refuses the injunction.
Tli? TriiNt a Druit Failure.
New York, Dec. 4.?It is officially announced
this moruing on Wall street
that all the negotiations for a settlement
of tho railroad troubles west and southwest
of Chicago have been broken oil*,
and the great clearing house plan has
fallen through. Tho committee, headed
by President Winslow, of tho St.
Louis & San Francisco road, is still in
existence, but has not vet considered
any new plan. The failure of the clearing
house scheme was caused by the
opposition of President Hughitt, of the '
Jiorthwestern road.
Kmiinror Jortoph'ii Thank*.
Vienna, Dec. 4.?Emperor Francis
Joseph has sent an autograph letter to
Count Von Taafe, the Austrian Prime
Minister, in which he thanks froin the
bottom of his heart all those charitable
persons who in celebration of the fortieth
anniversary of his accession to the
throne havo contributed to the relief of
the sick and needy. The peoples' action,
the Kmperor says, is a fresh proof of the
love for himself and their attachment to
the imperial family.
A Full from Grace.

There was a time when the Wheeling
ReghUr was just a bit looked up to as a
respectable aud reliable newspaper. But
to all intents, the time has passed. Its
violent and disgraceful course in the
State contest, in giving the State and its
people a bad name abroad, by ita reckless
and designing claims, and is condemned
by honest citizens in both parties. We
dislike to upbraid a brother editor, but
the purity and honesty and intelligence
of the newspaper fraternity should never
recognize and uphold the reckless and
designing course of the fygiiter.
