4 PRESIDENTS 'MESSAGE.
Wabhisoton, Dec. 4, 1871.'.
To the Senate and House of Representatives :
In addressing my third annual message
to the law-making branch of the govern
ment, it is gratifying to be able to stale that
during the past year success has gene. ally
attended the effort to execute ail laws
found upon the statute books The
policy has been not to inquire into the
wisdom of the laws already enacd. but
to learn their spirit and intent and enforce
them accordingly: The, past year has,
under a wise Proidence,1eeD oneofgenc
eral prosperity to the nation,- - It . has,
however, been attended withmore than
usual chastisements in the loss of life and
property by storm and fire. These dis
asters have served to call forth the best
elements of human nature in onr country,
and to develope a friendship for us on the
part of foreign nations which goes far to
ward alleviating the distress occasioned
by the calamities. The benevolent who
have so generously shared their means
w ith the many victims of these great mis
fortunes, will reap their reward in the
consciousness of having performed a noble
act, and in receiving the grateful thanks
of the men, women and children whose
sufferings they have relieved.
OUR I'OREION RELATIONS THE TBgATY
OF WASHINGTON.
The relations of the United States with
foreign powers continue to be friendly.
The year has been au eventful one in
witnessing two great nations, speaking
one language and having one lineage,
settling by peaceful arbitration dispute of
long standing, and liable at any lime to
bring tho.se nations into bloody and hos
tile conflicts. An example has'thus been
set which, if successful in its final issue,
uiay l followed by other civilised na
tions, i nd be the final means of returning
to productive industry millions of men
now maintained to settle tbe disputes of
nations by the tiayonet and broadsword.
I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty
alluded to, which has been concluded
since the adjournment of Congress wit hi
her Britannic Majesty, and a copy of the !
protocol of the conferences of the com
missioners by whom it was negoiiated.
This treaty provides meihods for adjust
ing the questions pending between the
two nations Various questions are to be
adjusted by arbitiation. I recommend
Congress, at an early day. to make the
necessary provision for the tribunal at
Geneva, and for the seve.-al Commissions
on the part ol the Lnited btates, called for
by the 1 reaty. His Majesty the King of
Italy, the President ot" the bwi b Confed
eration, and iii., Majesty the mjeror of
brazil have each con.-en:ed, on the j 'iut
request of the two powers, to name au ar
bitrator tor the tribunal t Geneva. 1
have caused my thanks to be suilably ex
pressed for the readiness with which the
j- int request has been c:mi;lied with, by
the appointment of gentlemen of emmin
enit: and learning to these important po
sitions. His Majesty the ,uiperor of
Germany has been pleased to comply w ith
the req test of the government, and has
consented to act as the arbitrator of the
disputed water boundary oetween the
United states and Great Britain, an'' the
contracting parties in the treaty have un
dertaken to regard, a between themselves,
certain principles or' public law for which
the Lnited Mates have contended from
the commencement of their history. They
have also agreed to brin-.- these principles
lo the know ledjif; of the oilier maritime
powers, and invite them to accede lo
them. .Negotiations me going on as to
the form of the note by which the iuvita
tion is to be extended o the powers. I
recommend the le!iUlaU..n necessary
the part of the L nited States to bring in
to operation the auicles of the treaty re
luting to the fisheries, and to the other
matters touching the relations of the
Lnited States toward the Bri.ish .North
American possessions, to become opera
tive as soon a the proper legislation shall
be had on the Dart of Great Britain and
its possessions. It is much to be desired
that this legislation may become operative
before the tishcrmeu of the United btates
begin u make their arrangements for the
comirK season.
1 have addressed a communication, ol
which a copy is transmitted herewith, to
the Governors ot Aew lurk, Pennsyl
vania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois
and Wisconsin. urrinsr upon the govern
ments of those btates respciiveh'. the
necessary action on their part to carry in
to effect the object of the article of the
treaty which contemplates the use of the
canals on ei'her ide. connected with the
navigation of the lakes and rivers form
ing the boundary, on terms of equality by
the inhabitants of both countries, it is
hoped that the importance of the object
and the benefits to flow therefrom w ill se
cure the speedy approval and legislative
sanction of the btates concerned.
THE FOKTY SISTII PARALLEL.
I renew the recommendation for an ap
propriation for determining the true po
sition of the forty-ninth parallel of laii
tuue, where it forms the boundary be
tween the United btates and the iiiiiish
North American possessions as between
the Lake of the Woods and the summit
of the Hocky Mountains. The early ac
tion of Congress in the recommendation
named would put it in the power of the
War Department to place a force in the
field during the next summer.
THE rBOTECTIOS OF GERMAN RESIDESS
IX FRANCE.
The resumption of diplomatic relations
between If iance .and Germany have en
abled me to give directions for the with
drawal ol tbe protection extended to Ger
mans in France by the diplomatic and
consular representatives of the United
States in that country. It U just to add
that the delicate duly of this protection
has been performed by the minister and
the consul General at Paris, and the vari
ous consuls in i' ranee under the super
vision of the latter, with great kindness
as well as with prudence and tact. Their
course has received the commendation of
the German Government and has wound
ed no susceptibility of the jb'rench.
"i EOLATIONS WITH OTHER NATIONS.
Tne Government of the Emperor of
uennany continues lo manliest a tnetKlly
feeling toward tne United States, and a
desire to harmonize with the moderate
and just policy-w hich this Government
maintains ib its relations with tbe Asiatic
powers as well as with the buth Ameri
can Republics. I have given assurance
that friendly feelings of that Govern
ment are fully shared by the United States.
The ratification of the consular and na
turalization, conventions with the Aus-tro-Hungary
Empire have been exchanged.
1 have been officially informed of the an
nexation of the States of the Church to
the Kingdom of Italy, and the removal of
the capital of that kingdom to Rome. In
conformity w ith the established policy of
the United States I have recognized ihis
change. The ratification of the new
treaty of commerce between the United
States and Italy has been exchanged.
The two powers have agreed in the treaty
that property at sea shall be exempt from
capture in case of war between the two
jtowers. The United States have spared
no opportunity of incorporating this rule
into the obligations of nations. -
8P AN SIH-AMERICAN CLAIMS. "
The forty-first Congress, at its third
session, made an appropriation for the or
ganization of mixed commission for ad
judicating upon the claims of citizens of
I the Lnited Slates against Spain, growing
out of the insurrection in Cuba. That
f Commission has since been organized. I
transmit herewith the correspondence re
lating to its lormatton and its junsdic
( tion. It is to be hoped that this com-
mission will afford the claimants a com
.1
o
plete remedy for their injuries. It has
been made the agreeable duty of the
United btates to preside over the confer
ence at Washington between the pleni
potentiaries of Spain and the allied Ameri
can Republicans, which has resulted in
on armistice, with the reasonable assur
ance of a permanent peace. . .
THE NORTHERN BEAR CATACAZY.
The intimate friendly relations which
have so long existed between the United
States and Russia continue undisturbed.
The visit of the third son of "the Emperor
is & proof that there is no desire on the
part of his government -to diminish the
cordiality tf these relations, i he hospit
able reception which" has been given to
the Grand Duke. is vproof that on our
6ide we share the w"rslieVtf that Govern
ment. The inexcusable course of the
Russian Minister at .Washington rendered
it-necessary to' ask. his removal, imd to
decline to longer receive that functionary
as a diplomatic- representative. It was
impossible, with self-resiec. or witb a
just regard to the dignity of the country.
to permit M. catacazy to continue to bold
intercourse with this government, for bis
abuse of government officials, and for his
persistent interference, through various
means, with the relations between the
United States and ot her powers. In ac
cordance with my wishes this govern
ment has been relieved of further inter
course with Air. Catacazy, and the man
agement of the affairs of the Imperial
Legation has passed into the hands of a
gentleman entirely unobjectionable.
CHISA AND JAPAN.
With Japan the United States continues
to maintain intimate relations. The
Cabinet of the Mikado has. since the close
of the last session of Congress, selected
citizens of the United States to serve in
important offices in several departments
of the Government, I have reason to
thiuk that this selection is due to an ap
preciation of the disinterestedness of the
policy which the United States have pur
sued towards Japan. It is our desire to
continue to maintain this disinterested
and just policy with China, as well as
Japan. 1 he correspondence transmitted
herewith shows that there is no disposi
lion on the part of this Government to
3werve from its established course.
THE COREA.
Prompted by a desire to put an end to
the barbarous treatment of our ship
wrecked sailors on the Corean coasts, I
instructed our Minister at Pekin to en
deavor to conclade a convention wiih
Corea for securing the safety and prevent
ing tne inhuman treatment ot such mari
ners. Admi.-al Rogers was instructed to
accompany him with a sutbeient force to
protect him in case of need. A small
surveying party sent out, on reaching the
coast was treacherously attacked at a dis
advantage. Ample opportunity wa
given for explanation and an apology for
the insult; neiiher came. A force was
then landed. After an arduous march
over a nigged and difficult co.oitry, the
forts from which ihe outrages -A been
committed were gallantly assaulted and
were destroyed. Having thus punished
the criminals, aud having vindicated the
honor of he Hag, tiie exjicdiiiou returned,
Lnding it impracticable under theciicum
stances to concl title the desired conven
tion. I respectfully refer to the corres
pondence relating "thereto herewith sub
mitted, and leave the subject for such ac
tion as Congress may see tit to take.
THE REPUBLIC OF MEXICO
has not yet repealed tue very objection
able law establishing what is known as
the "free bone, on the frontier of the
United States. It is hoped that this may
yet be done, and also that more stringent
measures may be taken by that Republic
for restraining lawless persons on its
frontier. I hope that Mexico, by its own
ucllm, will soon relieve this Government
of the difficulties experienced from these
causes.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA.
Our relations with the various Republics
of Central and South America continue,
with one exception, to be cordial and
friendly.
I recommend some action by Congress
regardiug the overdue installments under
the aw ard of the Venezuela Claims Com
mission of ls'ji). The internal dissen
sions of this government present no jus
thxation for the absence of effort to meet
their solemn treaty obligations.
The ratification ot an extradition treaty
with .Nicaragua has been exchanged.
it is a subject for conjriatulatkm tha'
the great- emphe oi Brazil has taken the
iniatory steps toward the abolition of
slavery. Our relations with that empire,
always cordial, will natuially be made
more so by this act. It is not too much
to hope that the government of Brazil
may hereafter find it for its interests, as
well as intrinsically right, to advauce to
wards entire emancipation more rapidly
than the present act contemplates. The
true prosperity and greatness ot a nation
is to be f und in the elevation and educa
tion of its laborers.
SLAVERY IN THE WEST INDIES.
It is a subject for regret that the reforms
in this direction, which wore voluntarily
promised by the statesmen of Spain, have
not been carried out in its West Indiana
colonies. The laws and regulations lor
the apparent abolition of slavery in Cuba
and Porto Rico leave most of the laborers
in bondage, with no hope of release until
their lives become a burden to their cm
clover. I desire to direct your attention to the
fact that the citizens of the United States
are large holders in foreign lauds of this
damental law of their adnntrxl nonntrv -
I recommend to Congress to provide

dignity of the flag. It is hoped that all
pending questions with Spain, growing
out of the atiairs of Cuba, may be adjusted
in the spirit of peace and of conciliation,
which has hitherto guided the two pow
ers in their treatment of such questions.
OtJB DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH CHINA
-. AND JAPAN. ,,;
To give the importance, and to add to
the efficiency of our diplomatic'relations
with Japan and China, and the further re
taining the good opinion of those people,
and to secure to the United States its
share of commerce destined to flow be
tween those nations and the balance of
the commercial world, I earnestly recom
mend that an appropriation be made to
support at least tour American youths in
each of tne-te countries to serve as a part
of the official family? of onr; Ministers
there. Our representatives- would not
even then be placed upon aneqialitv with
the representatives of Great Britain and
some other powers. As now situated,
our representatives in Japan and China
PLYMOUTH, MARSHALL COUNTY, IND., DECEMBER 14, 1871..
have to depend for interpreters and tran-1
siators unon natives of those countries !
who knowour language imperfectly, or
procure for the occasion the services of
employees in foreign business hours or
the interpreters to othei foreign minis
ters. I would also recommend liberal
measures fcr the purpose of aiding the
American liies of steamers now playing
be' ween San Frsuclsco and Japan, China,
and the Australian line at most, onr only
remaining fines of ocean "steamers and of
increasing their service.
THE TARIFF AND REVENUE LAWS.
The National debt has been reduced to
the extent of eighty -six millions, til'ty
seven thousand, one hundred and twenty
six dollars and eighty cents during the
year, aud by the negotiation of National
bonds at a lower rate of interest, the in
terest on the public debt has been so far
diminished that now the sum to be raised
for interest on that account is nearly $17,
000,000 less than on the 1st of Maich,
ldaii. It was" highly desirable that this
rapid dimunirion should take, place, b Ui
to strengthen the the credit of tbe coun
try and to convince its citizens of their
entire ability to meet every dollar of the
liability without uaukrupting them. But
in view of the accomplishment of these
desirable cuds, of the apid development
of the resources of the country, its in
creasing ability to meet the large de
mands, and aud tbe amount already paid,
it is not desirable that the present re
sources of the country should continue to
be taxed in order to continue this rapid
payment. I therefore recommend a mod
ification of both tariff and internal tax
laws. 1 recommend that all taxes from
internal sou.ces be abolished, except
those on spirituous, vinous and malt liq
uors, and tobacco in its various forms,
and stamps. In readjusting the tariff, I
suggest that a careful estimate 1-e made of
the amount of surplus revenue collected
under the present laws, after providing
the current expeuces of the Government,
the interest account, and a sinking fund,
and that this surplus be reduced in s.ich a
manner as to afford the greatest relief to
the greatest number. There are many
articles not produced at home, . such as
medicine and aud compounded essences,
from which very little revenue is derived,
but which enter into general use All
such articles 1 recommend to be placed
on the free list. Should a further reduc
tion piove advisable, 1 would recommend
it to be made on these articles which can
be touched without disturbing home pro
duction or reducing the wages of Ameri
can labor. 1 have not eniered into fig
ures, because to do so would be to repeat
that laid before you iu the report of the
becretary of '.he Treasury.
A NEEDED REFORM IN THE COLLECTION
LAWS.
The present laws for collecting the rev
enue pay the Collectors of Customs
small salaries, but provide for shares in
all seizures which are made at the princi
pal M)its of entry, particularly to raise
the compensation of these alHcials to a
large sunt. It has al ways seemed to me
as though this system" must at times work
pei nicously. it holds out an inducement
to dishonest men, should such get pos
session of these offices, to be lax in their
scrutiny of goods entered, lo enable them
filially to make a large seizure. Your
aiteuiion ij respectfully invited to. this
subject.
A 'SPECIE BASIS.
The contiuued fluctuations in the value
of gold as compared with the national
currency has a most damtioing effect upon
the increase and development ol the coun- 1
try, iu keepiug up the prices of all articles
necessary iu every day lite, it fosters a
npitit of gambling in tbe national t.nan
ces. If the question can be unit as t. 1
how to get a uxed value to our currency
that value constantly and uniformly ap
proaching ar with specie a very ilesim
ble oujfct will be gained.
ARMY MATTERS.
For the operations of the army in the
past year, the expense of maintaining it,
ai.d the estimates for coniinueing the sea
coast and other improvements, conducted
under the supervision of the War Depart
ment, I refer you to the accompanying
report of the Secretary of War. 1 call
your attention to the provisions of the
act of Congress approved March :J. 1815J.
which discontinues prominent staff corns
oftliearmyir.mil provided for by law.
1 recommend ihat the number of officers
in each grade of the staff corps be nxed,
and that whenever ihe number iu any one
atte tails oelow the number so nxed.
that the vacancy may be filled by promo
tion from tbe grade below. 1 "also rec
ommend that w hciv the office of chief of
corps liecomes vacant, the place may be
tilled by selection - troiu the .corps in
wliich the vacaucy exists.
TUE N.VVY.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy
shows an improvement iu the number and
efficiency of the naval force, without a
material increase in the expose of sup
porting it. - This is due to the policy
w hich has been adopted, and is being ex
tended as fast as our material will admit,
of using smaller vessels as cruisers at the
several stations. By these means we
have been enabled to occupy at once a
larger extent ot cruising ground, to visit
more frequently the posts where the pres
ence of our lia is desirable, and generally
to discharge efficiently the appropriate
duties of the navy in time nf peace, with
out exceeding the number of men or the
expenditures authorized by law. 'During
the past year the navy has, in addition to
its regular service, supplied the men and
officers for the vessels of the Coast Sur
vey; and has- Completed the surwys au
thorized by Congress of the Isthmus of
Darien and Tehuantepec ; and under their
authority has sent out an expedition,
completely furnished and eqnipited, to ex
plore the unknown ocean of lire iNorth.
The suggestions of the report as to the
necessity of increasing and in proving the
material of the Navy, and the plan rec
ouiended for reducing the prrsonuel of
the service to a peace standard, by the
gradual abolition of certain grades of ofll
cers, the reduction ot others, and the em
ployment of some in the service of the
commercial marine, are well consideieu
and deserve the thoughtful attention til
Congress. I also recommend that all
promotions in the navy above Captain
be by selection instead of by seniority.
This course will secure in ihe? higher
grades greater efficiency, and hold out an
incentive to youug officers to improve
themselves in the know ledge of -their pro
fession. ?. i,V -- . . ., ........

Republics. With a vast territory like
ours, inuch'of it sparsely populated, but
all requiring the services of the mail, it is
not at present to be expected that this de

out a gradual approach to this end fiom
year to year is confidently relied upon,

TUE RU-KLUX LAW.
There has been imposed upon the Exe
cutive bianch of tbe Government the ex
ecution of the act of Congress, approved
April so, 161 1, ana commonly Known as
Ihe Ku-Klux law, in a portion of the
btate of South Carolina. - The necessily
ol the course pursued will be demonstra
ted by the report ot the committee to in
vestigate Sonthern outrages. Under the
provisions of tbe act I issued a proclama
tion, calling the attention of the people of
the United States to tbe same, and de
claring my reluctance to exercise any of
the extraordinary Dowers thereby con
ferred upon me except in case of impera
tive necessity, but makiug known my pur,
pose to exercise such powers whenever it
should jcconie necessary to do so for the
purpose of securing to all citizens of the
United States a peaceful enjoyment of the
rights guaranteed to them by the Cousti
tulion and the laws. Alter the passage
of the law, information was received that
combiuations of the character referred to
in this law, existed and were powerful in
many parts of the Southern States, panic
ularf in certain counties in the state of
South Caioliua. Careful investigation
was made, and it was ascertained that in
nine counties of that State, such combi
nations were active and powerf 1, embrac
ing a stiflic.enl iwirtion of the citizens to
control the local authority, and liavin
among other things the object of depriv
ing the emancipated class ot the substan
tial benehts of freedom, and of preventing
the free political action of these citizens
w ho did not sympathize with, their own
views. Among their operations were frc
quent scouigings and occasional assassi
nations, generally perpetrated at niuht by
disguised persons, the victims in almost
all cases being citizens of different politi
cal sentiments from their own, or free
lersons who had shown a disposition to
claim equal rights with other citizens.
Thousands of offensive aud well-disposed
citizens were the sufferers by this lawless
violence. 1 hereupon, on October 13, la71
a proclimation was issued, in the terms of
the law, calling upon the members of the
combinations to disperse within five days,
and to deliver to the marshal or military
officers ot the United States all arms, and
dinmuilion, uniforms, di.-guises, and other
means and implements used by them for
tari j ing out their unlawful purpose. This
w;,ruin- not h .ving been heeded, on the
17ih ol October another p:oclimation was
issued susiending the prvilcge ol the writ
of hubcas eorpttif in nine counties in that
state. Direction was given that within
i tie counties so oesignaicu, persons sup
posed, opt n credible int rmation, to be
members oi such unlawful combination
should be arrested by the military forces
of the United Stutes and delivered lo the
Marshal to be dealt with according to
law. In two of said counties, ork and
Spin tansburg, many arrests have been
made At the last account the number o:
persons Ihus arrested ws 108. Severa
iiunareu wnose criminality was found to
be ot an interior degree were released for
tbe present. These have genes ally made
contessious of their guilt. Great caution
has been exercised in making these nr-
rsts, ana noi wiiiisianaing the large num
ber, it is believed that no innocent iwrson
is now in custody. The prisoners w ill
be hell for trial iu the judicial tribunals
oi .ue l nneii Elates, as soon, it Hp
pears, as the authorities of the United
States were about to take vigorus mens
ures to enforce the law, many persons ab
scouued, and there is good ground ibi
supjvjsing that all of such persons Jiave
violated lire law. A lull report of w hat
has been done tinder this law will be sub
muted to Congress by the Attorney Gen
e.ut. -
POLYGAMY PROSECUTIONS.
In Utah there still remains a remnant of
barbarism remignaiit to civilization, de
cency and the laws ot the United States.
Territorial officers, however, have been
found w ho are willing to perform their
duty iu a spirit of equity, and with a due
sense of sustaining ihe majesty of the
law. Neither polygamy nor any other
violation of existing statutes will be per
mitted within the territory of the United
btates. It is not with the religion of the
self styled saints that we are now dealiDg,
but their practice?. Thev w ill be ;ro-
tucted in the worship of God according to
tiie dictates of their conscience, but they
will not be permitted to violate the laws
under the cloak of religion. It may be
advisable for Congress to consider what,
iu the execution of the laws against
polygamy, is to be the status of the plu
ral w irs and their olfspring. : The pro
priety of Congress of passing an enabling
act authorizing the territorial legislature
of Utah to legitimatize all born prior to a
time fixed iu the act, might be justified by
its humanity to these innocent children.
This is a suggestion only, and not a re
commendation. .......
, . THE INDIAN POLICY.
The policy pursued toward the Indians
has resulted favorably, so far as can be
judged from the limited time during
w hich it has been in operation. Through
the exertions of the societies of Christians
to whom itJias been Intrusted, the ex
ecution of tire policy of the Board of Com
misstoners authorized by the law of April
10, 18o0, many tribes of Indians have been
induced to settle on reservations, to culti
vate the soil, to perform productive labor
ol various kinds,- - and to partially accept
civilization. They are being cared for in
such a way, it is hord, as to induce those
still pursuing their old habits of life to
embrace the only opportunity which is
left them to avoid extermination. 1 rec
ommend liberal appropriations to carrv
out the Indian peace policy, not only be
cause it is human. Christian like, and eco
nomical, but because it is right. I rec
ommend to your favorable consideration,
also, the polity of granting a territorial
government to the Indians of the Indian
Territory west of Arkansas and Missouri,
and South of Kansas. In doing so every
right guaranteed to the Indians by treaty
should be secured.- Such a course wis lit
be the means of collecting roost of the In
dians now between the Missouri and the
Pacific, and south of the British posses
sions, into one territory or one State.
The Secretary of the Interior has treated
apon this subject at length, and I recom
mend to you Ms suggestions. . -
' THE PUBLIC LANDS. '
I renew my recommendation that tbe
public lands be regarded as a heritage to
our children, to be disposed of only as re
quired for occupation, and to actual set
tlers. Those already granted have been
in great part disposed of in such a way
a to secure access to the balance by the
uojuy neuter wno may wis u to avail mm-
sell Ol them nnn eaiitsrtn thnnlri tua ovun.
clsed in attaining so desirable an object,
1 Educaiional intereuta n,o n a
by the grant of the proceeds of the sales
of public lands to settlers. I do not wish
to be understood as recommending, in the
least degree, a curtailment of what is be
ing done by the General government for
the encouragement of education.
TnE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE
INTERIOR
submitted with this, will gVe you infor
mation collected and Dre pared for publi
cation, in regard to the census taken dur
ing the year 18711, the orations oi tue
Bureau of Education lor tue year, tne
Patent Office, the Pension Office, the
Land Office, and the Indian Bureau.
TJIE REPORT OF TDK COMMISSIONER OF
AGRICULTURE
gives the operations of his department for
the vear. As agriculture is the ground
work of our nrosoerity. too much impor
tance cannot be attached to the labors of
this department. It is in the hands of an
able head with able assistants; all zeal
ously devoted to introducing into the
agricultural productions ol tne nation, an
useful products adapted to any of the vari
ous climates and soils of our vast terri
tory, and to giving all useful information
as to the method of cultivating tbe plants,
cereals, and other products adapted to
peculiar localities. Quietly but surely
the Agricultural Bureau is working a great
national good, and if liberally supported
ihe more widely its influence will be ex
tended, and the' less dependent we shall
be upon the products of foreign coun
ti ies.
SALARIES OF BUREAU OFFICERS.
The subject of compensation to heads of
bureaus and officials holding positions of
responsibility, and requiring ability and
character to fill properly, is one to which
yo ir attention is invited. But few of the
officials receive a compensation equal to a
respectable support ot lamily. while their
duties are such as involve millions of in
terest. In private life services demand
compensation equal to services rendered ;
a w ise economy would dictate the same
rule in the Government.
ESTIMATES.
I have not given the estimates for the
support of tiie government for the ensu
ing year. There is no comparative state
ment between the expenditures for the
year just passed and the one just pre
ceding, because all these figures are con
tained in the accompany ing" reports or in
those presented directly to Congress.
The&e estimates have my approval.
REMOVAL OF DISABILITIES.
More than six years having elapsed
since the last hostile gun was fired be
tween the armies then arrayed against
each other- one lor the perpetuation, and
the other for the destruction, of the
Union it. will be considered whether it is
not now time that the disabilities imposed
by the Fourteen h Auiemiment should be
removed. I do not see the advantage or
propriety of excludiug men from office
merely because they were before the re
bellion oi standing and character sum
eient lo be elected to positions requiring
mem to iaKe tne oatn to suppoit the
Constitution, and admitting to eligibility
niose entertaining precisely the same
views, but of less standing in their com
munities. It may be said that the former
violated an oath w bile the latter did not.
1 he latter did not have it in their Dower
to do so. If they had taken this oath it I
can not be doubted that they would have
broken it, as did the former class. If
there are any great criminals distinguished
above all others for the part they took in
opposition to tbe government, they might,
in the judgment of Congress, be excluded
front such amnesty. This subject is sub
mitted for your consideration. 1 he con
dition of the southern btates is unhappily
not good. Social obtracism for opinion's
sake, erstual violence or threats towards
persons entertaining political views op
posed to those entertained by the majority
of the old citizens, prevents immigration
and the flow of much needed capital, into
the States lately in rebellion. It will be a
happy condition of the countiy w hen the
old citizens of these States will take an
interest in the public affairs, promulgate
their ideas honestly entertained, vote for
men representing their views, and permit
the same freedom of expression and ballot
in those cutcrtaiuinj different political
convictions.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Under the provisions of the Act of
Congress, approved February 21t, 1871,
a Territorial Government was organized
in the District of Columbia. Its resu.ls
have tlms far fully realized the e.jecia
tioas of its advocates. Under the direc
tion of the Territorial officers a system of
improvements has been inaugurated by
means of w hich Washinyton Is
becoming a city worthy of the Nation's
Capital. The citizens of the District
having voluntarily taxed themselves to a
large amount for the purpose of contribu
ting to the advancement of the seat of
government, 1 recommend liberal appro
priations on the part of Congress in or
der that the Government mav ht-ar it
just share of the expense of cart-vino- nut a
judicious system ofimprovemeuts.
y tue great tire in Chicago the most
important of the Government buildings
in that city were consumed. Those
burned bud already become inadequate to
the wants of the Government in that
growing city, and looking to the near fu
ture v ere totally inadequate. I recom
mend, therefore, that an appropriation be
made immediately to purchase the remain
der of the square on which the destroyed
buildings stood, provided it can be pur
chased at a li;ir valuation, and provided
tlm Legislature of Illinois will pass a law
authonzing its condemnation for Gov
ernment purposes, and also an appropria
tion of as much money as can properly be
expended towards the erection of new
buildings during this gscal year.
IMMIGRATION.
The number of immigrants, ignorant
of our laws, and coming into our countiy
annually, has become so great, and the
impositions practice4 upon them so num
erous and flagrant, that I suggest Con
gress'onal action for their protection. It
seems to mc this is a fair subject of legis
lation by Congress. 1 can not now state
as lully as I desiie tie nature of tbe com
plaints that aie made by emigrants of the
treatir.tnt they receive, but will endeavor
to do so timing the session of Congress,
particularly if the subject should receive
your attention..
. . , THE CIVIL 8ERVICB.
It lias been the aim of the administra
tion to enforce honesty and efficiency in
all public offices." Every public servant
w ho has violated the trust placed in him,
has been proceeded against with all the
vigor of the law. If bad men have re
ceived places it has been the fault of the
system established by law and custom for
making appointments, or the fault of t hose
w ho recommended for government potsi
tions persons not sufficiently well know n
to Jhem personally, or who give letters
endowing the cha racter of office seekers
without proper sense of the grave respon
sibility which such a course devolves up
on them. A civil service reform which
can correct this abuse is much desired.
In mercantile pursuits, the business man
who gives a letter of recommendation to
a friend to enable Mm to obtain credit
from a stranger, is regarded as morally
responsible for the integrity of his friend
and his ability to meet Ms obligations.
A reformatory law which wcnld enforce
this principle against all endorsers of per
sons for public places, would insure great
er caution in making recommendations.
A salutary lesson has been taught the
careless and tbe dishonest servant in the
great number t prosecutions and convia
1 tls.no th lo-t I, .:-.
j ing to notice the favorable change that is
, bringing to punishment those who We
Vol. XVI No.
proved recreant to the trust confided to
them, and in elevating to public office;
none but t!oae who possess the confidents
of the honest virtuous who, it will al
ways be found, comprise the majority ol
the community in which they live.
In my message to Congress one year
ago, I urgently recommended a reform in
the civil service of the country. Iu con
formity w ith that recommendation Con
gress, in the 9th section of an act making
appropriations for sundry civil expenses
vi uib jruvetiiiuem, ana ior other punv)
ses, approved March Sd, 1671, gave the
necessary authority to the executive to
inaugurate civil service reform, and
placed upon him the responsibility of do
ing so. Under the authoritv of said law
1 convened a Board of gentlemen emi
nently qualified for the work, to devise
rules and regulations to effect the needed
reform. Their labors are not complete
but it is believed that thev will siu-n-mi
iu devising a plan which can lie adopted
to the great relief of the Executive the
heads of departments, and members of
Congress, and which will redound to tbe
true interests ol the public service At
all events Ihe experiment shall have a fair
trial.
I have thus hastily summed un the
operations of the Government during the
past year, and made sueh suggestions as
occur to me to be proper for vour con
sideration, l submit them with a confi
dence that your combined action will be
wise, statesmanlike, and in the best infer.
est of the whole countrv.

MY ROOM MATE.
BY BELL LEE.
Your old friend, Alice Frazier, died
at the Asylum on the evening of the 16th
of April."
This was all there was telling me of the
death of her whom I loved so fondly.
Only a few simple words, but they con
tained a vast amount of sorrow, as well as
joy. Sorrow for the living aud for the
past, as connected with her to w hom the
sentence referred and yet joyfully I felt
when I read it, and remembered the doc
tor's words, " beyond all hope of recov
ery." At the age of sixteen I entered a f-malc
Institute, in one of the New England
States, aud there met Alice Frazier. I
remember so distinctly the. words of a
schoolmate : " It is like uniting right and
morning to make room mates of Bell and '
Alice ; ' a remark which was truthful to
the last degree, for Alice was a bright,
sparkling girl, with a fact;, a form, with
hair and eyes, that were divine, while her
voice was sweeter to me than tbe perfume
of roses, and when I was tired and weary
with my day's tasks, I would throw my
self upon our couch, w hile Alice w ould
tell me of ber far away southern home, of
her brothers and sisters, and the beauties
witti which thev were surrounded nnrl
I w ould more than half imagine I could j
uear me orooK oubbjing over us pebbled
bottom the mocking birds singing in tbe
boughs of the grand old magnolia trees
that I could see the servants to whom she
was so foncl'y attached, gathering around
w iu tuut vlki mess ye, lioney, as
she took her departure from them, and
came north to be an inmate of Mrs. B 's
school.
I had been reared in one of the plainest
homes on the western prairie, with no
thought of aught else than that of beinr
able to cipher through fractions, and of! bIc mht
takinir the nt-emium nt tin- mimiv r.,; She had
my agricultural wreath. I never had a
female friend, for my mother died while I
was yet too young to know what sorrow
was, and sisters, God gave me none. My
step mother was a maid of live aud thirty
when she wedded my father, and by her
hand was I mared. She low "sleeps the
deep that knows no waking," and I sin
ce.ely thank her lor all her kindness to
me, for she, no doubt, governed mc ac
cording to her conscience. It is not sur
prising that I should represent night, hav
ing been reared in the strictest manner by
one of the strongest miuded women it was
ever my misfortune to meet; and when
there came to our home an uncle , of my
mother's requesting my father to send me
to Mrs. B 's school, kindly offering to
meet all expenses, I crept away to my lit-1
tie room and cried. Ies, I was afraid to
go out in the world so far from familiar
scenes and meet strange faces. After
much promising aud persuading, I con
sented to accompany my uucle to the east.
Arriving at our destination, one beautiful
evening, just as the sun was sinking away
behind the hills, I met on the piazza, the
lady who was to assume the very respon
sible duty of mother towards me, aud who
was to mould my miud and character
for future usefulness. I remember the
smile of welcome she gave mc, which said
far more than words, as she took my
hands iu hers, and kissed me so fondly.
Turning to a party of girls she introduced
me to all, kindly requesting them to en
tertain me for a few moments while she
conversed with my uncle. In a short
time we proceeded to my room, and Alice
Frazier was presented to me as my room
mate. How bew itching she looked in her
pure muslin dress, with her hair hanging
in ringlets over her shoulders, and how
lovely she seemed, when she put ber arm
about me and said " you are so welcome"
From that moment I could not help lov
ing this "queen of beauty." Days came
and went, and I became more fondly at
tached to my room mate with each suc
ceeding one. Our friendship ripened in
to love, ' and each knew the other's
thoughts. Alice slept with ber head up
on my shoulder, and her arms about ray
neck, and in this position I have so often j
heard her plans for the future, and of the
glittering air castles she was constantly
erecting. What a happy faculty she pos
sessed of charming me into partaking of
those sweet thoughts with her. There is
nothing in tMs world so pure that sin and
corruption can not penetrate It. True it
may be in thoughts and minute particles,
but mind and substance is always more o r
less polluted. Ever since the day that
Eve was tempted, there have been ten
serpents in human' form to every Eden.
These halcyon days were not to last for
ever, and they came, to a close very sud
denly, on the occasion of a public eii'er
tainment given at our Institute. ; Through
some means, Alice was introduced to a
foreign looking individual bearing the
name of M. De Haven, and before she
slept I knew the was ttroagly infatuated
by him. Notes came and went from Alice
to M. De Havefl through, every concetva-
ble secret service-At last there were
stolen interviews, counseled with my
friend concerning such proceedings, but .
she would only throw her arms about my
neck and then slip away to meet her
lover in some secluded spot. I eould not -help
entertaining a cordial hatred for tM
man, but I could not wonnd the feelings
of my friend by telling her so. I fancied
something would occur to prevent their
marrying, and I knew if Mrs. R , be
came acquainted wi'ii the facta, Alice
would be sent home in disgrace. There
fore. I kept the secret in my heart, and
oh I how many times since have I cursed
myself for so doing, for liad I exposed
Alice, she might nave enjoyed her days
aud been an ornament to home and so
ciety. One evening early iu the fall, I
strolled out on . the lawn, and this time
farther than I was in the habit of goinff
to a shady nook and sat down on a huge
rock. Overhead the birds were twitter
ing their "good night" among the golden
branches of the maple ; while above, be
neath and around me, was to be seen the
finger touches of the first frost. I sat
here dreaming when presently I heard
voices and could distinguish words, and
afraid to leave my retreat, I crouched
down behind the rock and listened. "I
confess to liking the child, Herman ; but
w ould not marry her if I did not tWnk I
would get a good pile of the old man's
money. Oh ! the old folks will forgive
her, and if we went south, perhaps the.
wedding would be delayed, and those
confounded debts of mine must be.
piiid and this is the best chanee I
see at present." The , footsteps and
voices were lost in the distance,
and I ran froin my hiding place .
to find Alice and tell her all for the
voice was none other than that of De
Haven's and my little friend was going
to lay her heart at the feet of this man to
be trampled and crushed beneath the dust.
Alice had gone for a walk the matron
said aud .vould return in a few moments,
but dark came and no Alice, Mrs. B
became alarmed and sent messengers in
search of her. Nine o'clock came and a rap
at our door aroused me, they had brought
Alice pale and insensible to our room.
Her hair was matted about her neck
with the crimson blood which ooxed
from a wound at the side of her head.
The men who brought her said they
found her on the river bank where they
went to fish and recognized her, having
seen her but a few days previous, they hav
ing rowed a party across the river on the
occasion of apicuic given by our teachers.
M. De Haven was lying near her having a
broken limb and a bad cut on the head.
The poor child received the best of modi-
cal care and
uursing, Rnd her parents
were telghaphed for stating that Alice
was quite ill. In the course of time a
brotlier-inlaw arrived Waring the intelli
gence that through some unfortunate
speculations the father of Alice had In
come a bankrupt, the eveut pros' rat inir
! both father and mother with a severe fe
ver, and the real cause of my frieud's ill
ness not being known it was considered
best for the brother-iu-:aw to coins and.
accomnanv her home
Day after day we watched by the bed-
! side ol the poor unfortunate girl. In her
delirium she talked of M. De Haven iu
the fondest and most endearing manner.
finally a change came aud with the
' change her mind was restored, and in the
coarse of time she was able to be carried
to the parlor, where one evening she re
lated in the presence of 31 rs. B., her
brother-in-law and myself, all concerning
her accident ; a part of which wc had
known before, enough to tell us how near
she came to meeting death on that terri-
left the school to meet her
lover in a secluded spot, and go with him
to a magistrate and be married. Every
thing had been arranged and as soon as
they were united they were going to her
home and seek her parents pai ion. A
carriage was in waiting and they started
on their fatal journey winding along the
banks of the river admiring the beautiful
scenery and making plans for the future
not dreaming that aught else than happi
ness and a speedy union was in waiting
for them w hen something s.t the road
side frightened thair horses; they be
came unmanageble, then she saw a sud
den curve in the road at the top of a high
hill, and this was all she knew. M. De
Haven was taken to a farm house, aud
previous to the convalescence of Alice left,
the country. As soon as site could trove.
my beautiful friend went to her home in
the south, aud only once afterwards did I
hear from aer. In the spring following
the war broke forth and I lost all traces
of her.
Two years since I was travelling thro'
the Southern states, and while on board
a steamer bound from Mobile to Tusca
loosa, we stopped at a landing and an in
sane woman was put on board. I at once
recognized in her guardian, the, brother-in-law
of Alice, and hastened to make my
self known to him. With tears in his
eyes he pointed to the insane woman,
"Do you know who this is?" he said. I
remarked that I did not, but asked again,
"Where is Alice?" You may imagine
my feelings when he told me this maniac
was my once beautiful firiend my little
school mate who had slept so many
nights with her arms about my neck, and
now I dare not approach her. I learned
that her head had been seriously in
jured, in the fall she had received on tbat
dreadful night, and when she learned that
the man she loved had deserted her, with
the death of - her mother, the loss of
their nrnrtArnr . all .nrnKlnAj t ... .
j 1 - , w vvuiuiucu, ujougii on
a brain fever, and though life was left, her
reason had flown. . Her father had died
but a few months previous, and Alice had
been growing worse until tbe could no
longer be controlled. j . ...
When we arrived at Tuscaloosa, I ac
companied my friend to the asvlum tor
mc (tuipuscui learning wnat-tnepnvsician
thought concerning her, and these were
his words "beyond all hope of recovery."
Ienlisted the sympathies of a lady residing
near the asylum in behalf of Alice, and iu
