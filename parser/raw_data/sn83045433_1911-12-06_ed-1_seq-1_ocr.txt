ItuxMian Prejudice Against Jeirn
a Prevailing Factor.
New York. Dec 5. John Hays Ham
mond, speaking to-night at a meeting
of the Hungarian Republican Club,
characterized as a falsehood the as
sertion that 'ie had made a suggestion
to President' Taft concerning the atti
tude of Russia in the passport question.
He said he had never been asked forj.
a suggestion, and had never volun
teered any statement. He went at
length into the details of his business
trips to Rusia, said that he had not
acquired any interests in that country,
and spoke highly of the American Jew.
He was opposed, however, to the abro
gation of the treaty with Russia tint"
further diplomatic efforts have been
exerted, a- to precipitate abrogation
would inevitablv throw all American
and Russian relationships into chaos
He stated that the financial aid given;
lij Jews to the Japanese had added to
anti-Semitic feeling in Russia.
GIVE'S CORDIAL WELCOME.
Mr. Hammond was given a cordial
welcome when lie arried at the Cafe
Mai-tain, vjhere the Hungarian Republi
can Club held its banquet. His address
was awaited with keen interest, inas
much as it has been asserted that the
inaction of the government in the mat
ter of Russian recognition of American
passports is due to advice from Mr.
Hammond to President Taft that any
other course would disrupt businesr re
lations with Russia There iras' great
applause when Mr. Hammond emphatic
ally denied this allegation.
Mr Hammond. 1n beginning his
speech, said that if the charge which
had been made against him were true,
he would not hae the hardihood "to
look into the friendly faces before""
jne " He then described his first visit to
Russia, fourteen years ago, in company
with Leopold Hirsch, a Jew of the high
est standing in the religious, philan
thropic, and financial circles of Eng
land. Thev spent several weeks in the
oiintry, but decided adversely to the
investment of English capital on ac-
Mint ot the existing political condi-
lons.
Would Help Che Jens,
Mr.. Hammond's second visit to Russia.
1 year ago, was upon the invitation of
Mi Gregorv Wllenkin, the agent of the
Russian minister of finance. The latter
was inteiested in enlisting American
.ipital in the development of Russia,
und said that the establishment of more
intimate commercial relations with the
Vnited States would conduce to the im
provement of the status of his co-re-Iigionists.
"In accepting this invitation," said Mr.
Hammond, "I was quite as much in
fluenced by the desire to promote friend
ship between America and Russia as I
was by business considerations. I be
lieved then, and I am more assured of
the fact since my visit, that Mr Wilen
kin's views are right."
After stating that he had not acquired
any interests in Russia as the result of
the visit. Mr Hammond said that he
would not hesitate to avail himself of
any business opportunities that might
offer In Russia, "always bearing in
mind " he added, "my patriotic obliga
tions to do nothing inimical to the In
terests of my fellow-citizens " He went
on to say that English Jews were invest
ing in Russia, and he did not believe that
American Interests in Russia would op
orate to the disadvantage of American
Jews.
Explains RuKsInn Prejudice.
In discussing conditions In Russia, Mr.
Hammond said that he had found great
prejudice against the Jews.
"This prejudice was based," he said,
"upon their complicity in or sympathy
with revolutionary movements against
the government. The situation was fur

members of official and resident society
who visited the tea and sale, held at

Mgr. Cerettl, of the papal legation, was
the winner of a handsome big doll. The
church diplomatist accepted the doll,
laughed good-naturedly, and gave it in
charge or one of the ladies.
The winner of the bride doll, which
carried a. bouquet of . orchids and gar

THE
MISS BOARDMAN
COMMANDS TAFT
TO GJFJDDRESS
President Quickly .Responds
at .Red Cross Meeting.
TOPIC CHOSEN FOE HIM
Shattering precedent with consum
mate sang-froid, and startling her audi
tors with a splendid example of femi
nine daring, Miss Mabel T. Boardman,
whose energetic activity forms the real
pulsing life of the American National
Red Cross, vesterday afternoon arose
in the closing session of the seventh
annual meeting of the organization in
Continental Memorial Hall and gave an
order to the President of the United
States.
CHOOSES TAFT'S SUBJECT.
Standing in the center of the vast audi
torium, a charming picture of piquancy,
with her head tilted on one side and her
face turned upward, as though In appeal.
Miss Boardman actually exhibited the
temerity necessary to choose for Presi
dent Taft the subject of an address she
had just requested him to deliver, and
the President smiled and did as he was
told.
As' preSident of the Red Cross. Mr. Taft
was presiding at the business session, ap
parently happy in the knowledge that he
would not be asked to speak, as no
formal request that he deliver an ad
dress had been made, but Miss Board
man, who never lets an opportunity slip
by. and who. it is whispered, really is
the power behind the throne In Red Cross
affairs, did not intend to allow the Chief
Executive to escape.
Miss Boardman gained the privilege
of the floor just at a moment when It
seemed the President was about to
make his adieu and exit, and calmly
suggested that he deliver an address.
Having already surpassed the capacity
of the ordinary woman. Miss Boardman
capped the climax of an otherwise un
enliven session with the words.
Her Voice Commanding.
"Tell us about the national mine
safety demonstrations you witnessed
at Forbes Field, Pittsburg, Pa. on Oo
tober 31."
Mr. Taft smiled. He rose and re
plied: "I respond to a voice that we
all know to be commanding in this vi
cinity." Mr Taft then told of the mine safety
demonstration. He said:
"I am very glad to report I was in
Pittsburg when about twenty-five teams
were present to show the effectiveness
and . rfflclencx wltH which the" first-aid
procedure had been learned by men on
the ground to be used at places where
the exigency was likely to arise calling
for their services. What seemed to mc
to be the most encouraging sign was the
intense concern that all who took part
had in the speed with which they did
the work and the thoroughness with
which they carried on their Instructions."
After a few more remarks. Mr. Taft
excused himself with another smile for
Miss Boardman and the v.ords "Kow 1
hope I may be excused because there is
another organization in this city to whose
action and meetings while I never at
tendI have to pay some attention." In
view of the fact Congress has just con
vened. President Taft was not delayed
longer.
Probably the most important business
of the closing session was the election
of officers, which resulted in the unani
mous choice of the following: President,
"William Howard Taft: vice president,
Robert TV. De Forrest; counselor, Fred
erick I.ehmann; treasurer. A. Piatt An
drew, and secretary, Charles I Magee.
The following were chosen members of
the board of incorporators: Francis B.
Reeve, of Philadelphia; Thomas Nelson
Page, of Washington, and Kenneth Clark,
of St. Paul. They will fill the vacancies
caused by the deaths of Bishop Alex
ander Mackay-Smith, William T Ward
well, and Surg. Gen. Walter Wyman.
rnterestinK Report Read.
Morning and afternoon session were al
most entlrel" consumed by the reading
of reports, which were sufficiently Inter
esting to have attracted a much larger
gathering than which had assembled.
Probably the most Important and com
prehensive report was that of the central
committee. tread by its chairman, Muj.

who reviewed the past year, showing the
strides made in Red Cross work.

Madrid, Dec. 5. Prime Minister Canale
jas to-day received tho following tele
gram from te Inranta Eulalia, who is in
Paris .
"I await punishment, but as I am con
templating a voyage, I request you to
transmit t as soon s possble."
It s expected tht King Alfonso will
cut off the civil list allowance of his
aunt, the princess, as a result of her
refusal to obey his orders and stop the
publication in Paris of her new book,
"The Thread of Life."
The public sides with the King and
considerable indignation' Is expressed
over the stand taken by the princess
in refusing to obey his orders
As the infanta is a member of the
royal family King Alfonso could not
have her deprived of her titles, save by
a special act of Cortes. Instructions have
have been sent to the Spanish ambas
sador in Paris to visit Eulalia and In
duce her. If possible, to stop the publi
cation of her book and obey the King's
orders.
Paris, Dec. 5. The Infanta Eulalia of
Spain to-night insisted that the wording
of her dispatch to the prime minister
was correct as given. The dispatch, she
said, is intended for tho King, and that
by the word "you" she means Alfonso.
She explained that she had sent the King
two telegrams, one merely announcing
that she would take leave of the King.
She did not give out this dispatch, nor
has it been given out In Madrid, but she
gave out and confirmed the text of thr
dispatch as received in Madrid.

the 8.000 Turks and Arabs were killed,
while the ItaUan casualties are estimated
at 100. 'The Italians- captured eight can

The victory gives the Italians posses

Patent Covers Balancing Device on

patent was issued yesterday which

By Issuing this license the United States
Patent Offlcepractlcally puts itself on
record as declaring that the Wrights are
wrong in assuming that Glenn H. Cur
tlss Infringes the automatic stability con
trol system which they devised.
The Wrights' action against Curtiss Is
on the eye of coming up in the Federal
Court at Buffalo. If the court should
adjudge that Curtiss infringed, It would
mean that practically every aeroplane
built In America or Europe was an In
fringement. The patent was Issued to the defunct
Aerial Equipment Association. It covers
the aileron balancing devices used by Cur
tiss and the shoulder control by which
the ailerons are operated. The ailerons
form the basis of contention between the
Wrights and Curtiss. The Wrights claim
that the ailerons or wings are on infringe
ment on'thelr warping edges.
The patent Is Issued to the AerlaTvKquip

Los Angeles, Dec. 5. The great
doors of San Quentin prison will not
clang shut behind James B. McNamara,
sentenced to live his life out there; and
John Joseph McNamara, his brother,
doomed to fifteen years' confinementr"
until the men have appeared before a
Federal grand jury on Thursday and
disclose the innermost workings of their
war of dynamite. Even while Judge
Walter N. Bordwell was pronouncing
the sentences that cut off the iberty
I of these two men, Oscar Lawlor, spe
cial prosecutor in charge of the gov
ernment's probe into the gigantic dyna
mite conspiracy, was talking with Ortie
McManigal, through whose confession
they were forced to admit their crimes.
SUMMONED BEFORE Jl'RY.
Afterward Lawior held a conference
with Fredericks and then a more hurried
one with Deputy United States District
Attorney Edward Regan, and It was de
cided 1 hat the McNamaras should appear
before the Federal body on Thursday.
Subpoenas will be served on Sheriff W.
A. Hammel. commanding him to produce
his prisoners on that day.
While this conference was being held
Judge Bordwell, who has kept silent dur
ing the trial, issued a striking statement
in which he confirmed the story of the
district attorney that no bargain had
been made, and further declared that thrf
disclosure tnat "bribery of jurors had
been attempted by the defense in the
McNamara trial was the real reason that
led to the'ea of guilty entered last Fri
day suddenly terminated the great mur
der trial. Incidentally, he declared em
phatically that Uncoln Steffens. a maga
zine writer, whom he referred to as an
anarchist, had played no part in the final
settlement of the case.
I'rennre n Statement.
The judge's statement was made at the
Insistence of newspaper men after the
whole case had ended, the sentence had
been pronounced, .and the court room
that liad been jammed with interested
spectators had been cleared. When he
was convinced that ho should make a
statement, he prepared it deliberately
and revised it before he allowed it to be
used. The judge scored the proposition
of the defense that James B. McNamara
be allowed to enter a plea of guilty and
take the consequences, even of death, to
save his brother. Commenting on It, he
remarked:
"Isn't that a proposition that would
make the blood run cold?"
Judge Bordwell's statement was as fol
lows: ,
"In a spirit of Indifference to every
thing In tfie McNamara cases, save the
facts and the law applicable thereto, I
deem It due to the court and to this com
munity that I should make a brief public
statement regarding circumstances at
tending the abrupt close of the case, to
gether with sufficient comment to indi
cate my views as to such circumstances.
This is done in the hope of correcting. If
possible, some misconceptions due to er
roneous publications, ana particularly to
an article which appeared In a local
newspaper on the second Instant over
the signature of Lincoln Steffens.

"In the first place, the claim, or sug
gestion, that the termination of the cases
was due to the efforts of himself and
other outsiders who undertook to influ
ence the officers of the court other than
the Judge Is without Justification in fact.
"I wish also to denounce the claim of
that gentleman and of other persons for
him that the change of the pleas In
these cases from not guilty to "guilty"
was due to his efforts as groundless aae
untrue. He Is correct In the statement
that the court was not a party to any
negotiations for what he terms a 'com
promise' of these caps; but there is no
ground or any ciaim mat ne inaucea me

the matter. The district attorney acted
