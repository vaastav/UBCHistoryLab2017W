Bridging the Firth of Forth.
London Times.
Considerable progress is now being
made with the works of the great bridge
across the Firth of Forth, which includes
two spans of the unprecedented width of
one-third of a mile each, or about four
times that of any existing railway bridge.
Some 30,000 per month is the present
expenditure in temporary and permanent
works, at which rate the bridge will be
completed in the anticipated period
of five years from the date of the contract.
Only four classes of materials will be used
in the permanent works of the bridge,
and these being steel, granite, whinstone
and Portland cement, will be of the most
durable and trustworthy character. Borne
idea may be formed of the magnitude of
the undertaking fiom the statement that
the materials required for the Forth
bridge would fill 1000 goods trains of
average length and capacity. This
enormous weight will, of course, require
to be handled several times, the whin
stone alone being found on the spot,
the granite being shipped from Aber
deen, the steel from Glasgow and South
Wales, and the Portland cement from
different places in England. As it is in
tended to manufacture the steel super
structure of the bridge on the spot, very
extensive works have been constructed at
Queensferry, and the plant provided in
cludes about fifty steam engines of various
classes, and a large number of specially
designed hydraulic appliances, drilling
machines, and other tools for dealing with
the 45,000 tons of steel which will be used
in the bridge.
To fix the position of the piers of a
bridge having two clear spans of 1700 feet
and two of 700 feet across a channel 200
feet .in depth, is not so simple a problem
as may appear to some persons. In the
case of the Forth the banks are more or
less precipitous and the country undulat
ing, so that it was diihcult to get a base
line for a trigonometrical measurement.
At the request of Mr. Fowler, the Ord
nance department kindly sent a party of
sappers to recover the old stations used
in the ordnance survey of Scotland, and
to take the necessary additional observa
tions to determine the width across the
Firth of Forth. The calculated result dif
fered about one foot from that obtained
by Messrs. Fowler and Baker's engineers,
which is not much, perhaps, in a difficult
measurement of over a mile across deep
water, but enough to make it desirable
that it should be set right. Mr. Baker
held the view that it was possible to
measure the 1700 feet span to the eighth
of an inch if necessary, and last week the
measurement was made without any dif
ficulty whatever. A length of 1700 feet
was first measured with what may be
termed absolute exactitude along a
Btraight piece of the North British rail
way, and posts of a certain, height were
'firmly fixed at each end. A steel piano
forte wire was then hung from these
posts with a sag or droop of twenty-four
feet at the center, and marks were fixed
to each end of the wire to indicate the
1700 feet length. The wire was then
coiled on a roller and taken on board a
steam launch, from which it was laid like
a submarine telegraph cable across the
channel of the Forth. It was then hauled
up above the surface of the water till it
hung with the original droop of twenty
four feet, when, assuming the tempera
ture to be the same, the marks put on the
pianoforte wire should indicate the re
quired span of 1700 feet. This process
was repeated several times and the wire
taken ashore to the railway to test wheth
er it had stretched, but all the observa
tions were in exact accord. The sensi
tiveness of this simple mode of measuring
the span with a wire weighing only eight
pounds in all was quite astonishing. Thus
when Mr. Baker slacked out the wire only
one-quarter inch in the 1700 feet, Sir
Thomas Tancard, one of the contractors,
who was in a boat in the center of the
Forth, at once signaled there was too
much droop in the wire. At another time
he signaled that it was too high, but a
reference to the thermometer showed that
the temperature had fallen two degrees,
so that the wire proved itself a most deli
cate indicator of changes of temperature.
A Queer Election in North Carolina.
Washington Special.
The news from North Carolina is to the
effect that Thomas G. Skinner, the Dem
ocratic candidate, has been ejected to
Congress as the successor ef the late W.
F. Pool, the successful candidate of the
Republicans last year. The election of
Skinner was a foregone conclusion, but it
causes a queer state of affairs in the state.
Since Pool's election last year the Demo
cratic Legislature have gerymandered
the Congressional districts, and what
was the First district is now in part em
braced in another. After Pool's death
the question arose as to whether the
electors of the old district should vote for
his successor or whether those of the
newly constituted First district, which
now embraces counties formerly in other
districts, should elect the man. The
Governor of the state decided that the
new First district should fill the va
cancy, and he issued the call for
the election accordingly. It thus
happened that some counties who
voted for Pool did not vote in the present
election, and other counties which were
embraced in other districts, and already
represented in the Forty-eighth Congress,
did so vote, so that some counties are not
represented in the Forty-eighth Congress
when the case comes up in Congress, if
the Democratic majority which controls
the House will let it be discussed, that the
question of the constitutional right of all
the people of a state to be represented in
Congress will be aired a little.
Sheridan's Ride.
Cleveland Leader Letter.
All the world knows of the famous
charge at Winchester, and the story of his
ride there has become a household song.
It was so in every one of Sheridan s
battles; he was always at the front; he
could not stay at the rear and direct as
other generals did; he must be in the
thickest of the fight. At the battle of
Winchester it is said he tried to do as
Grant did and stood for a time at one
side, but as the battle became serious he
exclaimed "by God, I can't stand this!"
and rushed into the melee.
"Old Winchester," the horse which
Sheridan rode on this occasion, died only
a few years ago. He was a wonderful
animal, and Sheridan says he went
through from eighty-five to ninety en
gagements on him. "He was hit," savs
he, "but not killed at the battle of Chick
amauga. A shot passed under his belly
between his legs, and he spread his legs
apart and would not move. I had got off.
Everybody in the army knew the horse.
He could walk five miles an hour, and he
kept all the other horses about him trot
ting to keep up with him. He died of old
age at New Orleans, and was well taken
care of until the last."
Always Ask for the Editor.
Philadelphia Call.
' Above all things remember that the
only way to get a thing printed, is to see
the editor personally. Editors don't go
by the matter in a manuscript. They go
by the looks of the writer. Besides that,
time hangs very heavily on the hands of
people around newspaper offices, and it is
difficult to see what would become of
them if would-be contributors did
not call once in a while to talk
about their articles or play check
ers. Be careful, however,-in ascending to
the editorial rooms to skip.. the double
acting spring step which- is always some
where along the stairs, and turns over,
landing victims in the cellar-' This is not
meant for contributors; but for peddlers,
and nothing bo worries - an editor as to
find some contributor's bones among
those of the peddlers' when it comes to
the annual cellar-cleaning.
An ostrich is apparently the most ill
tempered bird in existence. They never

have no particular preference ordinarily
as to mating. They are always on the
lookout to kick some one, and if the kick
has the intended effect it is pretty sure to
prove fatal. The blow is aimed forward,
and is accurate. For this reason the per
son who pulls the stocking over the
ostrich's head at the time when the feath
ers are to be cut must be wary and experienced.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
To Congress of the United States:
At the threshold of your deliberations I
congratulate you upon the favorable aspect
of the domestic and foreign affairs of this
government Our relations with other
countries continue to be upon a friendly
footing. With the Argentine Republic,
Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Hayti,
Italy, Santo Domingo and Sweden and Nor
way no incident has occurred which calls for
special comment The recent opening of
new lines of telegraphic communication
with Central America and Brazil, permitted
the interchange of messages of friendship
with the governments of those countries.
During the year there have been per
fected and proclaimed consular and com
mercial treaties with Servia and a
consular treaty with Roumania, thus
extending our intercourse with the
Danubian countries, while our
Eastert relations have been put upon a wider
basis by treaties with Corea and Madagascar.
The new boundary survey treaty with Mexi
co, a trade-mark convention and a supple
mentary treaty of extradition with Spain,
and conventions extending the duration of
the Franco-American claims commission,
hare also been proclaimed.
Notice of the termination of the fisheries
articles of the treaty of Washington was
duly given to the British government and
the reciprocal privileges and exemptions of
the treaty will accordingly cease on July 1,
1885. The fisheries industry pursued by a
numerous class of our citizens on the northern-
coasts, both of the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans, are worthy of the fostering care of
Congress. Whenever brought into competi
tion with the like industries of other coun
tries, our fishermen, as well as our manufac
turers of fishing appliances and preparers of
fish products have maintained a foremost
place. I suggest that Congress create a com
mission to consider the general question of
our rights in the fisheries and the means of
opening to our citizens under just and en
during conditions the richly stocked fishing
waters and sealing grounds of British North
America.
ASSISTED IMMIGRANTS.
The question has arisen touching the de
portation into the Vnited States from the
British islands, by government or municipal
aid, of persons unable there to gain a living,
and equally a burden on the community
here. Such of these persons as will come un
der the pauper class as defined by the law
have been sent back, in accordance with the
provisions of our statutes. Her majesty's
Eavernment has insisted that precaution
ave been taken before shipment They
have, however, in so many cases proven in
effectual, and especially so in certain recent
instances of needy e'migranta reaching our
territory through Canada, that a revision of
our legislation upon the subject may be
deemed advisable.
Correspondence relative to the Clayton
Bulwer treaty has been continued and will
be laid before Congress.
EXPORTATION OF SWINE PRODUCTS.
The legislation of France against the im
portation of prepared swine products from
the United States has been repealed. That
result has been due no less to the friendly
representations of this government than to
a growing conviction in France that the re
striction is not demanded by any real danger
to health. Germany still prohibits the in
troduction of all swine products from
America.
1 extended to the imperial government a
friendly invitation to send experts to the
United States to inquire whether the use of
these products was dangerous to health. This
invitation was declined. I have believed it of
such importance, however, that the exact
facts should be ascertained and promulgated
that I have appointed a competent commis
sion to make a thorough investigation of the
subject Its members have shown their pub
lic spirit by accepting their trust without
pledge of compensation, but I trust that
Congress will see in the national and inter
national bearings of the matter a sufficient
motive for providing at least for reimburse
ment of such expenses as they may neces
sarily incur.
OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
The coronation of the Czar at Moscow
afforded to this government an occasion for
testifying its continued friendship by send
ing a special envoy and a representative of
the navy to attend the ceremony. w hile
there have arisen during the year no grave
questions affecting the status in the Russian
empire of American citizens, of other faith
than that held by the national church, this
government remains ftrm in its convictions
that the rights of its citizens abroad should
be in no wav affected by their religious be
lief.
It is understood that measures for the re
moval of the restrictions which now burden
our trade with Cuba and Porto Rico are un
der consideration by the Spanish govern
ment. The proximity of Cuba and the
peculiar methods of administration which
there prevail necessitate constant discussion
and appeal on our part from the proceedings
of the insular authorities. I regret to say
that the just protests of this governmert
have not as yet produced satisfactory re
sults.
The commission appointed to decide cer
tain claims of our citizens against the Span
ish government after the recognition of a
satisfactory rule as the validity and force of
naturalization in the United States, has'
finally adjourned. Some of its awards, though
made mo than two years ago, have not yet
been paid. Their speedy payment is ex
pected. Claims to a large amount wnicn
were held bv the late commission to be
without its jurisdiction have been diplo
matically presented to the Spanish gov
ernment As the action ot the
colonial authorities which has given rise to
those claims was admitedly illegal, full
reparation for the injury sustained by our
citizens should be no longer delayed. The
case of the Masonic has not yet reached a
settlement The Manilla court has found
that the proceedings of which this govern
ment has complained were unauthorized,
and it is hoped that the government of Spain
will not withhold the speedy reparation
which its sense of justice should impel it to
offer for the unusual seventy and unjust
action of its subordinate colonial officers in
the case of this vessel.
The Helvetian confederation has proposed
the inauguration of acts of international
treaties for the referment to arbitration of
grave questions between nations. This gov
ernment has assented to the proposed nego
tiations of such a treaty with Switzerland.
Under the treaty of Berlin liberty of con
science and civil rights are assured to all
strangers in Bulgaria. As the United States
have no distinct conventional relations with
that country and are not a party to the
treaty they should, in my opinion, maintain
diplomatic representation at Sofia for the im
provement of intercourse and the proper pro
tection of the many American citizens who
resort to that country as missionaries and
teachers. I suggest that I be given authority
to establish an agency and consul general at
the Bulgarian capital.
The United States are now participating
in a revision of the tariffs of the Ottoman
empire. They have assented to the applica
tion of a license tax to foreigners doing busi
ness in Turkey, but have opposed the op
pressive storage tax upon petroleum enter
ing the ports of that country. The govern
ment of the Khedive has proposed that the
authority of the mixed judicial tribunals in
Egypt be extended so as to cover citizens of
the United 8tates accused of crime who are
now tried before consular courts. This gov
ernment is not indisposed to accept the
change, but believes that its terms should be
submitted for criticism to the commission
appointed to revise the whole subject.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA.
At no time in our national history has
there been a more manifest feeling of close
and lasting relations with a neighboring
state than now exists with respect to Mexico.
The rapid influx of our capital and enter
prise into that country shows by what has
already been accomplisncd the vaft recipro
cal advantages which must attend Vie prog
ress of its internal development. The treaty
of commerce and navigation of 1843 has been
terminated by the Mexican government, and
in the absence of conventional engagements
the rights of our citizens in Mexico now de
pend upon the domestic statutes of that re
public. There have been instances of harsh
enforcement of the laws against our vessels
and citizens in Mexico; of denial of the dip
lomatic resort for their proteccion. The in
itial step toward a better understanding has
been taken in the negotiations by the com
mission authorized by Congress, of a treaty
which is still before the Senate awaiting its
approval.
The provisions for the reciprocal crossing
of the frontier by the troops in pursuit of
hostile Indians, have been prolonged for an
other year. The operations of the forces of
both governments against the savages have
been successful, and several of their most
dangerous bands have been captured or dis
persed by the skill and valor of United States
and Mexican soldiers fighting in a common
cause.
The convention for the resurvey of the
boundary front, the Rio Grande to the Pacific,
having been ratified and exchanged, the
preliminary reconnoistunce therein stipu
lated has been effected. It now rests with Con
gress to make provision for completing the
survey and relocating the boundary monu
ments. A convention was signed with Mexico 'on
July 13, 1882, providing for the rehear
ing of the cases of Benjamin Weil and
the Abra Silver Mining Company, in whose
favor awards were made by the late Ameri
can and Mexican claims commission. That
convention still awaits the consent of the
Senate. Meanwhile, because of the charges
of fraudulent awards, which have made a
new commission necessary, the Executive
has directed the suspension of navments of
-the distributive quota received from Mexico.
vur gvograpuica proximity iu
America, and our political and commercial
relations with the states of that country jus
tify, in my judgment such a material in
crease of our consular corps as, will place at
each capital a consul general.
The contest between Bolivia, Chili and
Peru has passed from the stage of stragetic
hostilities to that of negotiation, in which
the counsel of this government has been ex
ercised. The demands of Chili for absolute
cession of territory have been maintained
and accepted by the party of General Igle
sias to the extent of concluding a treaty of
peace with the government of Chili, in gen
eral conformity with the terms of the proto
col, signed in May hut between the Chilian
commander and General Iglesias, As a re
sult of the conclusion of this treaty. Gen
eral Iglesias has been formally recognized by
Chili as President of Peru, and his govern
ment installed at Lima, which has been
evacuated by the Chilians.
A call has been issued by General Iglesias
for a representative assembly to be elected
on the 13th of January and to meet at Lima
on the 1st of March next Meanwhile the
provisional government of General Iglesias
has applied for recognition to the principal
powers of America and Europe. When the
will of the Peruvian people shall be mani
fested I shall not hesitate to recognize the
government approved by them.
Diplomatic and naval representatives in
this government attended at Caracas the
centennial celebration of the birth of the
illustrious Bolivar At the same time the in
auguration of the statue of Washington in the
Venezuelan capital testified to the veneration
in which his memory is held there. Congress
at its last session authorized the executive to
propose to the Venezuelan government a
recompanying of the awards of the mixed
commission of Caracas. The departure from
this country of the Venzuelan minister has
delayed the opening of negotiations for
revising the commission. This government
holds that until this establishment of a
treaty upon this subject the Venezuelan
government must continue to make the pay
ments provided for in the convention of
1806.
There is ground for believing that the dis
pute growing out of the unpaid obligations
due from Venezuela to France will be satis
factorily adjusted. The French Cabinet has
proposed a basis of settlement which meets
my approval, but as it involves a recasting
of the annual quotas of the foreign debt, it
has been deemed advisable to submit the
proposal to the judgment of the Cabinets of
Berlin, Copenhagen, The Hague, London and
iiadriu.
HAWAII.
At the recent coronation of His Majesty
King Kalaakaka, this government was rep
resented both diplomatically and by the
formal visit of a vessel of war. The question
of terminating or modifying the existing
reciprocity treaty with Hawaii is now before
Congress. I am convinced that the charges
of abuse and frauds under that treaty have
been exaggerated, and I renew the sugges
tion of last year's message that the treaty be
modified wherever its provisions have proved
onerous to legitimate trade between the two
countries. I am not disposed to favor the
entire cessation of treaty relations which
have fostered good will between the coun
tries and contributed toward the equality of
Hawaii in the family of nations.
ASIATIC LEGATIONS.
In pursuance of the policy declared by
this government, of extending our inter
course with the Eastern nations, legations
have, during the past year, been established
in Persia, Siam and Corea. It is probable
that permanent missions of these countries
will, ere long, be maintained in the United
States. A special embassy from Siam is now
on its way hither.
The treaty with Corea was perfected by the
exchange at Seoul, on May 19 last, of the
ratifications of the lately concluded con
vention, and envoys from the King of Tah
Chosun have visited this country
and received a cordial welcome.
Corea, as yet unacquainted with
the methods of Western civilization now in
vites the attention of those interested in the
advancement of our foreign trade, as it
needs the implements and products which
the United States are ready to supply. We
seek no monopoly of its commerce and no
advantages over other nations, but as the
Chosumese.ln reaching for a higher civiliza
tion, have confided in this republic, we can
not regard with indifference any encroach
ment on their rights.
JAPAN AND CHINA.
China, by the payment of a money in
demnity, has settled certain of the long
pending claims of our citizens, and I have
strong hopes that the remainder will soon be
adjusted.
Questions have arisen touching the rights
of American and other foreign manufactur
ers in China under the provisions of treaties,
which permit aliens to exercise-their indus
tries in that country. On this specific point
our own treaty is silent, but under the. oper
ation of the most favored-nation clause we
have like privileges with those of other
powers. While it is the duty of the govern
ment to see that our citizens have the full
enjoyment of every benefit secured by treaty,
I doubt the expediency of leading in a move
ment to constrain China to admit an interpre
tation which we have only an indirect treaty
right to exact. The transference to China of
American capital for the employment there
of Chinese labor would, in effect, inaugurate
a competition for the control of markets
now supplied by our home industries. There
is good reason to believe that the law restrict
ing the immigration of Chinese has been vio
lated, intentionally, or otherwise, by the
officials of China, upon whom is devolved
the duty of certifying that the immigrants
belong to the excepted classes. Measures
have been taken to ascertain the facts inci
dent to this supposed infraction, and it is be
lieved that the government of China will co
operate with the United States in securing
the faithful observance of the law.
The same considerations which prompted
Congress at its last session to return to Japan
the Simoneski indemnity, seems to me to re
quire at its hands like action in respect to
the Canton indemnity fund, now amount
ing to $300,000.
The question of the general revision of the
foreign treaties of Japan has been considered
in an international conference held at Tokio,
but without definite result as yet. This gov
ernment is disposed to concede the requests
of Japan to determine its own tariff duties,
to provide such proper judicial tribunals as
may commend themselves to the Western
powers for the trial of causes to which for
eigners are parties, and to assimilate the
terms and duration of its treaties to those of
other civilized states.
THE DARK CONTINENT.
Through our ministers at London and
at Monrovia this government has endeavored
to aid Liberia in its differences with Great
Britain touching the northwestern bounda
ries of that republic. There is a prospect of
adjustment of the dispute by the adoption
of the Monnah river as the line. 1 his ar
rangement is a compromise of the conflict
ing territorial claims, and take from Liberia
no country over which it lias maintained
effective jurisdiction.
The rich and populous valley of the Congo
is being opened to commerce by a society
called the International African association,
of which the King of the Belgians is presi
dent, and a citizen of the united states
the chief executive officer. Large tracts of
territory have been ceded to the association
by native chiefs; roads have been opened;
steamboats placed on the river, and the
nuclei of states established at 22 stations un
der one flag, which offers freedom to com
merce and prohibits the slave trade. The
objects of the society are philanthropic. It
does not aim at permanent political control,
but seeks the neutrality of the valley. The
United States cannot be indifferent to this
work, nor to the interests of their citizens
involved in it It may become advisable for
us to co-operate with other commercial pow
ers in promoting the rights of trade and resi
dence in the Congo valley, free from the in
terference, or political control of any one
nation.
SOCIAL AND SCIENTIFIC CONGRESSES.
In view of the frequency of visitation from
foreign governments to participa
and scientific congresses for the
ate in social
lie discussion
of important matters of general concern, I
repeat the suggestion of my last message
that provision be made for the exercise of
discretionary power by the executive in ap
pointing delegates to such conventions.
Able specialists are ready to serve the na
tional interests in such capacity without
personal profit or other compensation than
the defrayment of expenses actually incur
red, and this a comparatively small an
nual appropriation would suffice to meet.
I have alluded in my previous message to
the injurious and vexatious restrictions suf
fered by our trade in the Spanish West
Indies.
TRADE EMBARRASSMENTS.
Brazil, whose natural outlet for its great
national staple, coffee, is in and through
the United States, imposes a heavy export
duty upon that product. Our petroleum
exports are hampered in Turkey and in other
Eastern ports by restrictions as to storage.
and by onerous taxation. For these mis
chiefs adequate relief is not always afforded
by reciprocity treaties like that with Hawaii,
or that lately negotiated with Mexico and
now awaiting the action of the Senate.
It is advisable to provide some measure
of equitable retaliation in our relations
with governments which discriminate against
our own. If, for example, the executive
were empowered to apply to Spanish vessels
and cargoes from Cuba and Porto Rico the
same rules of treatment and scale of penal
ties for technical faults which are applied to
our vessels and cargoes in the Antilles, a re
sort to that course might not be barren of
good results.

REDUCTION OF THB DEBT.
If the revenue for the fiscal year which
will end on June 30, 1885, be estimated upon
the basis of existing laws, the secretary is of
the opinion that for that year the receipts
will exceed oo,oou,ouu, the ordinary expendi
tures, including the amount devoted to the
sinking fund. Hitherto the surplus, as rap
idly as it has accumulated, has been devoted
to the reduction of the national debt As a
result the only bonds no w outstanding which
are redeemable at the pleasure of the gov
ernment are the i per cents, amounting to
about $305,000,000. Ihe 44 per cents,
amounting to $250,000,000, and the $737,
000,000 4 per cents are not payable
until 1891 and 1907 respectively. If the
surplus shall hereafter be as large as the
treasury estimates now indicate, the three
per cent bonds may all be redeemed at least
four years before any of the four-and-a-half
per cents, can be called in. The latter, at
the same rate of accumulation of surplus.
can be paid at maturity, and the moneys re
quisite for the redemption of the four per
cents will be in the treasury many years be
fore those obligations become payable.
REDUCTION OF THE REVENUE.
There are cogent reasons, however, why
the national indebtedness should not be thus
rapidly extinguished, chief among them is
the fact that only by excessive taxation is
such rapidity attainable. In a communica
tion to Congress as its last session. I recom
mended that all excise taxes be abolished ex
cept thoss relating to distilled spirits, and
that substantial reductions also be made in
the revenues from customs. A statute has
since been enacted by which the annual tax
and tariff receipts of the government have
been cut down to the extent of at least fifty
millions or sixty millions of dollars. While
I have no doubt that still further re
ductions may be wisely made, I do not
advise the adoption at this session of any
measures fer large diminution of the nation
al revenues. Ihe results of the legislation
of the last session of Congress have not as yet
become sufficiently apparent to justify any
radical revision or sweeping modifications of
existine law.
'In the interval which must elapse before
the effects of the act of March 3, 1883, can be
definitely ascertained, a portion at least of
the surplus revenues may De wisely applied
to the lone neglected duty of rehabilitating
our national navy and providing coast ae-
tences lor tiie protection oi our naroors.
This is a matter towhich I shall again advert.
NATIONAL CURRENCY LEGISLATION.
Immediately associated with 'the financial
subject just discussed is the important ques
tion. What legislation, is needed regarding
the national currency? ine aggregate
amount of bonds now on deposit in the
treasury to support the National bank circu
lation is about $350,000,000. Nearly $200,-
000,000 of this amount consists of 3 per cents.
which, as already stated, are payable at the
pleasure of the government and are likely
to be called in within less than lour years,
unless in the meantime the surplus reve
nues shall be diminished. The probable effect
of such an extensive retirement of the se
curities which are the basis of the National
bank circulation would be such a contrac
tion of the volume of the currency as to pro
duce grave commercial embarrassments.
How can the danger be obviated? The most
effectual plan and one whose adoption at the
earnest practicable opportunity I shall heart
ly approve, has already been indicated. If the
revenues of the next four years shall be
kept substantiably commensurate with the
expenses tho volume of circulation will not
be likely to suffer any material dis
turbance, but if, on the other hand, there
shall be great delay in reducing taxation it
will become necessary either to substitute
some other form of currency in place of the
National bank notes, or to make important
changes in the laws by which their circula
tion la now controlled:. In my j ndgment the
latter course is far preferable. I commend
to your attention the very interesting and
thoughtful suggestions upon this subject
which appear in the secretary's report
The objections which he urges against the
acceptance of any other securities than the
obligations of the government it&elf as a
foundation for National bank circulation
seem to me insuperable.
For averting the threatened contraction
two courses have been suggested, either of
which is probably feasible. One is the issu
ance of new bonds having many years to
run, bearing a low rate of interest and ex
changable upon specified terms for those now
outstanding. The other course, which com
mands itself to my own judgment as the
better, is the enactment of a law repealing
the tax on circulation and permitting the
banks to issue notes for an amount equal to
90 per cent of the market value, instead of
as now, the face value of their deposited
bonds. I agree with the secretary in the be
lief that the adoption of this plan would af
ford the necessary relief.
THE TRADE DOLLAR.
The was coined ior the pur
pose of traffic in countries where silver
passed at Its value as ascertained by its
weight and fineness. It never had legal
tender quality. Large numbers of these
coins entered, however, into the volume of
our currency. By common consent their
circulation in domestic trrl hjt now em!
and they have thus become a disturbing ele
ment They should not be longer permitted
to embarrass our currency system. I recom
mend that provision be made for their re
ception by the treasury and the mints as
bullion at a small percentage above the cur
rent maraei price or silver ot like fineness.
REVENUE DISTRICTS CONSOLIDATION.
The secretary of the treasury advises a
consolidation of certain of the customs dis
tricts of the country, and suggests that the
President be vested with suoh power in rela
tion thereto as is now given him in respect
to collectors oi internal revenue, by section
3141 of the Revised Statutes. The statistics
-on this subject, which are contained in his
report, furnish of themselves a strong argu
ment in defense of his views.
At the adjournment of Congress the num-
uer vi murnsi revenue collection districts
was 126. By executive order, dated June 23.
1883, 1 directed that certain of these districts
be consolidated. The result has been a re
duction of one-third their number, which, at
present, is Dut S3.
INDIANS QUIET.
From the report of the secretary of war it
will be seen that in only a single instance has
there peen any disturbance of the quiet con
dition of our Indian tribes. A raid from
Mexico into Arizona by a small party of In
dians, which was pursued by General Crook
into the mountain regions from which it
had come. It is confidently hoped that
serious outbreaks will not again occur, and
that the Indian tribes which have for so
many years disturbed the Wert, will here
after remain in peaceable submission.
SEA-COAST DEFENSE.
I again call your attention to the present
condition of our extended sea-coast, upon
which are so many large cities whose wealth
and importance to the country would in
time of war invite attack from modern
armored ships, against which our existing
defensive works could give no adeqnate pro
tection, i lose works were Duilt before the
introduction of modern heavy-rifled guns
into maritime warfare, and if they are net
put in efficient condition we may easily be
subjected to humiliation by a hostile
power greatly inferior to ourselves.
As germane to this subject, I call
your attention to the importance
of perfecting of sub-marine torpedo de
fenses. The board authorized by the last
Congress to report on the method which
should be adopted for the manufacture of
heavy ordnance adapted to modern warfare
has visited the principal steel works in this
country and in Europe. It is hoped that its
report will soon be made, and that Congress
will thereupon be disposed to provide suit
able facilities and plans for the manufacture
of such gun as are now imperatively
needed.
STATE MILITIA.
On several occasions during the past
vear officers oi the army nave, at the
request of the state authorities, visited their
militia encampments for the inspection
of the troops. From the reports of these
officers I am induced to believe that the en
couragement of the state militia organiza
tions by the national government would be
followed by very gratifying results, and
would afford it in sudden emergencies the
aid ef a large body of volunteers educated in
the performance ot military duties.
NAVAL CONSTRUCTION AND IMPROVEMENTS.
The secretary of the navy reports that un
der the authority of the acts of August 5,
1882. and .March 3, 18S3, tne work ot strength
ening our navy by the construction of mod
ern vessels has been auspiciously begun.
Three cruisers are in process of construction
the Chicago, ot 4600 tons displacement.
and the Boston and Atlanta, each of 2500
tons. They are to be built of steel.
with the tensile strength and ductility pre-
scriDed Dv law, and in combination oi speed.
endurance and armament, are expected to
compare favorably with the best unarmed
war vessels of other nations. A fourth ves
sel, the Dolphin, is to be constructed of sim
ilar material. It is intended to serve as a
fleet dispatch boat The double-turreted
monitors Puritan, Amphitrite and Terror
have been launched on the Delaware river
and a contract has been made for the supply
of their machinery. A similar monitor, the
Monadonock, has been launched in Califor
nia. The naval advisory board and the
secretary recommend the completioa of the
monitors, the construction of four gunboats
and also ot three additional steel vessels like
the Chicago, Boston and Dolphin asaa im
portant measure of material defense. The
secretary urges also the immediate creation
of an interior coast line of water ways across
the peninsula of Florida; along the coast
from Florida to' Hampton roads; between
the Chesapeake bay and the Delaware river,
and through cape cod.
I feel bound to impress upon the attention
of Congress the necessity of continued pro
gress in the reconstruction of the navy, l he
condition of the public treasury, as I have
already intimated, makes the present an
auspicious time for putting this branch of the
service in a state of efficiency. It is no part
of our pel icy to create and maintain a navy
able to cope with that of the other great
powers of the world. We have no wish for
foreign conquest and the peace which we
have long enjoyed is in no seeming danger
of interruption. But, that our naval
strength should be made adequate for
the defense of our harbors, the protection of
our commercial interests, and the mainte
nance of our national honor is a proposition
from which no patriotic citizen can withhold
his assent
POSTAL AFFAIRS.
The report of the postmaster general eon-
tains a gratifying exhibit of the condition
and prospects of the interesting branch of
the public service committed to his care. It
appears that on June 30, 1883, the whole
number of postofflces was 47,868, of
which 1632 were established during the pre
vious fiscal year. The number of offiees
operating under the system of free delivery
was 154. At these latter offices the postage
on local matter amounted to $4,195,230.52,
a sum exceeding by $1,021,894.01 the entire
cost of the carrier service of the country.
The rate of postage on drop letters passing
through these offices is now fixed by law at
two cents per half-ounce or traction thereof.
In offices where the carrier system has not
been established, the rate is only half as
large.
DROP LETTERS.
It will be remembered that in 1863, when
free delivery was first established by law. the
uniform single rate postage upon local letters
was one cent, and so it remained until larj.
when, in those cities where carrier service
was established, it was increased in order to
defray the expense of such service. It seems
to me that the old rate may now, with pro
priety, be restored, and that, too, even at the
risk ot diminishing lor a time at least, the
receipts from postage upon local letters. I
can see no reason why that particular class
of man matter should be held accountable
for the entire cost of not only its own col
lection and delivery, but the collection and
delivery of all other classes, and I am confi
dent on a full consideration of the subject.
that the reduction of rate would be followed
by such a growing accession of business as to
occasion but slight and temporary loss to the
revenues of the postomce.
POSTAL TELEGRAPH.
The posm aster general devotes much of
his report to the consideration, in its
various aspects, of the relations of the gov
ernment to the telegraph. Much reflection
as I have been able to give to this subject
since my last annual message has not led me
to change the view which 1 there expressed.
in dissenting from the recommendation of
tne tnen postmaster general that the gov
ernment assume the same control over the
teleg.-aph which it has always exercised over
iue man. Auuiituug mat, us auinoruy in
the premises is as ample as has ever been
claimed for it, it would not in my judg
ment, pe a wise use oi mat autnonty to pur
chase or assume the control of existing tele
graph lines, or to construct others, with a
view ot entering into general competition
witn private enterprises.
ihe objections which may ke justly urged
against either of these projects, and indeed
against any system which would require an
enormous increase fn the civil service list
do not however, apply to some of the plans
which have lately provoked public comment
and discussion. It has been claimed, for ex
ample, that Congress might wisely authorize
me postmaster general to contract with some
private persons or corporation for the trans
mission oi mesages at specined rat-
under government supervision. Various
such schemes of the same general nature
but widely differing in their special charac
teristics nave oeen suggested in the pnbllc
prints, and the arguments by which they
nave been supported and opposed have doubt
less attracted your attention. It is likely
that the whole subiect will be considered bv
you at the present session. In the nature of
things It involves so many anestinni of detail
that vour deliberations would probably be
aided slightly, If it all. by any particular
suggestions which I might now submit I
renew my belief, however, that the povern-
meut should be authorized by law to exer
cise some sort of supervision over inter
state telegraph communication, and I ex
press tne nope that for attaining that end
some measure may be devised which will re
ceive your approbation.

WITNESS AND JURY FEES, ETC.
The attorney eencral criticizes in his re
port, me provisions of existing law nxing me
fees of jurors and witnesses in the Federal
courts. These provisions are chiefly con
tained in me act of robraary m ism, moujn
some of them were Introduced into that act
from statutes which bad been passed many
art
of
the
and
yean previous. It is ntanifest' that such
compensation as might when these laws
were enacted, have been just and reasonable
would, in many instances, be justly regard
ed at the present day as inadequate. I con
cur with the attorney general in the belief
that the statutes should be revised by
which these fees are regulated. So,
too, should the laws which reg
ulate the compensation of district attorneys
and marshals. They should ba paid wholly
by salaries, instead of in part by fees, as is
now the case. The change would prove to
be a measure of economy, and would dis
courage the institution of needless and op
pressive legal proceedings which, it is to be
feared, have in some instances been conduct
ed for the mere sake of personal gain.
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
Much interesting and varied information
is contained in the report of the secretary of
the interior. I particularly call your atten
tion to his presentation of certain phases of
the Indian question; to bis recommenda
tions for the repeal of the pre-emption and
timber culture acts, and for more stringent
legislation to prevent frauds under the pen
sion laws. The statutes which prescribe the
detection and punishments of crimes relat
ing to pensions could doubtless be made
more effective by certain amendments and
additions which are pointed out in the secre
tary's report.
ILLITERACY.
I have previously referred to the alarming
state of illiteracy "in certain portions of the
country, and again submit for the considera
tion of Congress, whether some Federal aid
should be extended to public primary edu
cation, wherever adequate provision therefor
has not already been made.
POLYGAMY.
commission has to the
secretary of the interior its second annual
report As a result of its labors in supervis
ing the recent election in that territory, pur
suant to the act of March 22, 1882, it appears
that the persons by that act disqualified, to
the number of about 12,000, were excluded
from the polls. This fact,however,arfords little
cause for congratulation, and I fear that it is
far from indicating any real and substantial
progress toward the extirpation of polyg
amy. All of the members of the Legislature
are Mormons. There is grave reason to be
lieve that they are in sympathy with the
practices that this government is seeking to
suppress, and that its effort in that regard
will be more likely to encounter their oppo
sition, than receive their encouragement and
support. Even if this view should happily
be erroneous, the law under which the
commissioners have been - acting should
be made more effective by the
incorporation of some such stringent meas
ures as they recommend, as were included in
bill No. 2238 on the calendar of the Senate at
its last session. I am convinced, however,
that polygamy has become so strongly in
trenched in the Territory of Utah that it is
profitless to attack it with any but the stout
est weapons which constitutional legislation
can fashion. I favor the repeal of the act
upon which the existing government de
pends, the assumption by the National Legis
lature of the entire political control of the ter
ritory, and the establishment of a commis
sion with such powers and duties as shall be
delegated to it by law.
AGRICULTURE.
The Department of Agriculture is accom
plishing much in the direction of the agri
cultural development of the country, and
the report of the commissioner, giving the
results of his investigations and experiments
will be found interesting and valuable. At
his instance a convention of those interested
in the cattle industry of the country was
lately held at Chicago. The prevalence of
pleuro-pneumonia and other contagious dis
eases of animals was one of the chief topics
of discussion. A committee of the conven
tion will invite your co-operation in inves
tigating the causes of these diseases, and pro
viding methods for their prevention and
cure.
ALASKA.
I trust that Congress will not fail at its
present session to put Alaska under the pro
tection of law. Its people have repeatedly
remonstrated against our neglect to afford
them the maintenance and protection ex
pressly guaranteed by the terms of the
treaty, whereby that territory was ceded to
the t'nited States. For sixteen years they
have pleaded in vain for that which they
should have received without the asking.
They have no law for the collection of debts,
the support of education, the conveyance of
property, the administration of estates, or
the enforcement of contracts; none in
deed for the punishment of criminals,
except such as offend against certain
customs, commerce and- navigation acts.
The resources of Alaska, especially in fur,
mines and lumber, are considerable in ex
tent and capable of large development,
while in its geographical situation it is one

RAILROAD AGGRESSION.
Complaints have lately been numerous
and urgent that certain corporations control
ling in whole or in part the facilities for the
inter-state carriage of persons and merchan
dise over the great railroads of the country
have resorted, in their dealings with the
public, to diverse measures unjust and op
pressive in their character. In some instances
the state governments have attacked and
suppressed these evils, Put in others they
have been unaoie to anord adequate relief.

Interfere In the premises, and what if any,
supervision or control it ought to exercise, is
one which merits yourcareful consideration,
While we cannot fail to recognize the im
portance of the vast railway systems of the
country and their great and beneficial in
fluences upon the development of our ma
terial wealth, we should on the other hand
remember that no individual and no cor
poration ought to be invested with absolute
power over the interest of any other citizens
or class of citizens. Ihe right of these rail
way corporations to a fair and profitable re
turn of their investments and to freedom to
their regulations must be recognised, but it
seems only just that so lar as its constitu
tional authority will permit, Congress should
protect the people at large in their inter
state traffic against acts or injustice which
state governments are powerless to prevent
FOREST PROTECTION.
In my last annual message I called atten
tion to the necessity of protection by suita
ble legislation of the forests situated upon the
public domain. In many portions of the
West the pursuit of general agriculture is
only made practicable Dy resort to irri
gation, while successful irrigation would be
impossible without the aid afforded by for
ests in contributing to the regularity and
constancy of the supply of water. During
the past year severe suttenng and great loss
of property have been occasioned by profuse
hoods followed by periods oi unusally low
water in many of the great rivers of
the country- These irregularities were
in great measure caused by the removal from
about the sources of the streams in question
of the timber by which the water supply
had been nourished and protected, the
preservation ol such portion ol the forests on
the national domain as essentially con
tribute to the equable flow of important
water courses is of the highest consequence.
Important tributaries of the Missouri, the
Columbia and the Saskatchewan rise in the
mountains of Montana, near .the north

between the Blackfeei and Flathead
Indian reservations. This region is
unsuitable for settlement, but upon
the rivers which flow from it depends the
future agricultural development of a vast
tract of country. The attention of Congress
called to the necessity of withdrawing
from public sale this part of the public do
main and establishing there a forest preserve.
INDUSTRIAL EXPOSITIONS.
The industrial exhibitions which have
been held in the United States during the
present year attracted attention in many
foreign countries where the announcement
those enterprises had been made public
through the foreign agencies of this govern
ment. The industrial exhibition at Boston
and the Southern exposition at Ixniisvillo
were largely attended by the exhibiters of
foreign countries, notwithstanding the ab
sence of any professional character in those
undertakings.
The Centennial exposition to be 'held
next year at New Orleans, in commemora
tion of the centenary of the first
shipment of cotton from a port of the United
States, bids fair to meet with like gratifying
success. Under the act of Congress of Feb
ruary 10. 1883, declaring that exposition to
national and international in its charac
ter, all foreign governments with which the
United States maintain relations have been
invited to participate. The promoters of
this Important undertaking have already re
ceived assurances of the lively interest which
excited abroad.

CIVIL SERVICE.
The eoruniissioners who were appointed
under act of January 16, 1883. entitled "An
to regulate and improve the civil service
the United Btates," entered promptly upon
discharge ef their duties. A series of
rules, framed in accordance with the
spirit of the statute, was approved
promulgated by the President In
ply
last
some particulars wherein they seemed de
fective, those rules were subsequently
amended. It will be perceived that they
discountenance any political and religious
tests for admission to those offices of the pub
lic service to which the statute relates. The
act is limited in its original application to the
classified clerkships iu the several executive
departments at Washington (numbering
about 5600) and to similar positions in cus
toms districts and postotfices where as many
as fifty persons are employed. A classifica
tion of these positions analogous to that ex
isting in the Washington o dices was in oper
ation before the law went into effect. Kleven
customs districts and twenty-three postotfices
were thus brought under the immediate
operation of the statute.
The annual report of the civil service com
mission, which will soon be submitted to
Congress, will doubt'ess afford the means of
a more definite judgment than I am now
prepared to express as to the merits of the
new system. I am persuaded that its effeets
have thus far proved beneficial. Its practi
cal methods appear to be adequate for the
ends proposed, and there has been no serious
difficulties in carrying them into effect
Since the 16th of July last no person, so far
as I am aware, has been appointed to the
public service in the classified portions there
of, at any of the departments, or at any of
the postotfices and customs districts above
named, except those certified by the com
mission to De the most competent on the
basis of the examinations held in conformity
PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION.
At the time when the present executive
entered upon his office his death, removal,
resignation or inability to discharge his
duties, would have left the government
without a constitutional head. It is possible,
of course, that a similar contingency may
again arise, unless the wisdom of Congress
shall provide against its recurrence. The
Senate at its last session, after full considera
tion, passed an act relating to this subject,
which will now I . trust commend itself to
the approval of both Houses of Con
gress. The clause of the Constitution
upon which must depend any
law regulating the presidential succession,
presents also for solution other questions of
paramount importance. These questions
relate to the interpretation of the phrase "in
ability to discharge the powers and duties of
said office." Our organic law providing that
wuen me rresioeni snail sunerlrom such
inabilty the presidential office shall devolve
upon the vice resident who must himself,
under like circumstances, give place to such
omcer as congress may by law appoint
to act as President. I need not here set forth
numerous and interesting inquiries, which
are suggested by these words ot the Consti
tution. They were fully stated in my first
communication to Congress, and have since
been the subject of frequent deliberations in
that body. It is greatly to be hoped that
mese momentous questions win nnu speeuy
solution, lest emergencies may arise when
longer delay will De impossible, and any
determination, albeit the wisest, may furnish
cause ior anxiety and alarm.
MODIFICATION OF THE VETO.
For the reasons fully stated in my last an
nual message I repeat my recommendation
that Congress propose an amendment to that
provision of the Constitution which pre
scribed the formalities for the enactment of
laws, whereby in respect to bills for the ap
propriation of public moneys the executive
may be enabled, while giving his approval
to particular items, to interpose his veto as
to such others as do not commend themselves
to his judgment.
CIVIL RIGHTS.
The fourteenth amendment of the Con
stitution confers the rights of citizenship
upon all persons born or naturalized in the
United Btates and subject to the mrisdiction
thereof. It was the special purpose of this
amendment to insure to members of the
colored race the full enjoyment of civil and
political rights. Certain statutory provisions
intended to secure the enforcement of those
rights have been recently declared unconsti
tutional by the Supreme Court. Any legis
lation whereby Congress may lawfully sup
plement the guarantees which the Constitu
tion attords for the equal enjoyment by all
the citizens of the United States of every
right privilege and immunity of citizenship
win receive

The subject of the lecture was the whale.
The lecturer said that the whale was but
little lighter than water, and its nostrils,
when it floated on the surface, were just
above the water line. A valve which
resisted the more firmly and stronger the
pressure Drought to Dear upon it kept the
water from falling into the lungs and
surface, and has reservoirs and oxygen
ated blood which it depends upon to sus
tain it for an hour under water. The
principle upon which this storing of fresh
blood depends is similar to that which
gives a human being his second wind
when running. The whale is killed be
cause of a knowledge of its need of com
ing to the surface to snout. It is driven
under water by the sailors whenever it
appears, without bemg allowed to take
in any fresh air. The small part of the
ear is at the opening, so that very little
water can get into it to produce a heavy
pressure. There is a double method of
hearing, so that the things which go on
in air and water both reach the whale's
sensibilities. In one class of whales the
nerves of smell are utterly absent, and in
the other very rudimentary. The food
of whales is partly fishes, but in the north
ern seas the only thing which exists in
sufficient Quantities for food is a mollusk.
The whalebone which hangs down at such
length when the whale s mouth is oDen
is laid into a groove when the mouth is

THE TRADE DOLLAR.
Kl'ILI?ay. 8P?k o' "he trade dollar," the
debased com to which attention ba been drawn
by public clamor and ducuwion. Doubtlew the
legilative purpose in ereatin it, waa to make a
piece of money that would find favor with Aaiatlo
people, and not one for tue at home. That pur
p se was net made known, however, by the let
ter of the law under which it inned from the
mint . . . As It la a coin of the United State,
having the image and superscription thereof,
sanctioned as auch by penal lira upon the counter
feiting of it, and once dignified as a legal tender
in payment of debt and dues, it should be re
f to red to iu first state, or called in at its nominal
value and melted. In the Judgment of this depart
ment it should be thus called in and melted. . .
It is possible to make an estimate of the amount
that would come to the treasury for redemption if
authority were given therefor. The whole tnue of
coin has been K.s.960,446. gome of that has disap
peared in manufactured articles; it iseatimated
from one to twv millions. It la calculated that
five-sixths thereof went abroad in the bexinninr
and it is believed that but a small part of that
has come bark, and that there is now held by our
people but from five to eight millions. Of that
which remained abroad, there is good authority
for saying that much of it found its way from
China to India, and into the melting-pot at the
mint in Calcutta, and has been there cast into the
eoivrof that country. The overweight in value of
the trade dollar by the side of the Mexican and
Spanish dollar, with which it was co-current In
China, brought much of it to the crnoible
there. It is understood in business circles
that iu China silver coin ia used by
weight and not by count, save in a few ports,
where Mexican dollars and a few other coins are
taken by tale. It to the practice of Chinese bank
ers, so it is reported, to stamp with their own mark
the coin which thev take and nav nut Th.
thus defaced soon comes to the stale and repnie of
bullion, and the presumption is that onr trade
dollars have, many of them, been so treated and
so suffered.
Bear i' mind, too, that from time to time for
some years past, until of a comparatively late date,
there havo been inducements to reship this coin
from China hither, because it baa been free in cir
culation in most parts of the land, and for moot of
the time at a par with gold and silver money.
There is reaton to believe, then, that beside the
sum of it in th hands of our own people, so
embarrassing amount will not come upon us from
abroad.
A uiorongh and effective redemption ef it can
be brought about in this way: Let authority be
given by Congress to the Treasury department te
barter for trade dollars at their nominal value,
standard dollars at their nominal value, and melt
ing the trade dollars to recoin them into standard
silver dollars, counting the trade dollars got In this
way as a part of the silver bullion which the act of
187S empowers and directs to be benght and coined
monthly, should the trade dollars have been so
abraded in use as to have lost a material part of
their origii al weisrbt, which is not much to be ap
prehended, a deduction might be made from the
rice, and fractional paymeuts made in aubaid
iry and minor silver coin. . . .
This department does not recommend that a le
gal teuder quality be again given to the trade dol
lar, to the sidden increase of the legitimate silver
money of the country, with th Inconvenience and
incongruity of two dollars circulating together, of
the same metal, of unequal real value and of dif
ferent devices, yet of equal value in payment of
debts and of purchase of property. It recommends
tnat authority be given for the redemption of the
trade dollar in the standard silver dollar, dollar
for dollar of nominal value, for the recoinage of
the metal to received into a standard silver dollar
to accord with the law for that coin, and for a re
duction of the amount of silver bnllion resulting
from the exchange from the quantity of bullion
required to be got by monthly purchases for the
purpose of coinage under the act of 1878. In the
judgment of this department that legislation 1

and by the need of the people for relief from the
confusion and exposure to recurring loss caused

COINS AND COINAGE.
The coinage executed at the mints during the
fiscal year was les in value than in the year im

made an increase in the number of pieces struck.
It was eleven and a half millions ever that of any
year since the organization of the mint bureau.
While upon this subiect the department recom
mends a revision and amendment of the coin
age laws. The minor coins are not what they
should be, either in anpearance, in convenience,
or in the ease with whUh some maybe distin
guished from others by the sense of touch er even
that of sight. There is so mnch resemblance of
some of small value to some ef greater value,
that often holders or receivers confound them,
and mistake them for others, and loss is sustained.
From time to time there has been an increase by
law of the devices upon them to ah extent hinder
ing the attainment of a good design. There can
be an improvement by a change of the metal of
which some of them are to be made, and by the
discontinuance of some ot the denominations not
needful for use.
The accumulation of standard silver dollars in
the custody of this department at the date of its
last annual report was uch as to cause serious in
convenience, actual and prospective, for ihe waut
of safe storage room. 1 he vault owned and hired

THE SURPLUS.
That there is likely to be a continuing surplus In
the treasury over the ordinary expenses of the
government, so long as the present revenue laws
remain. Is seen by those attentive to fiscal affair.
This has called out propositions for the disposal
of public moneys, two of which maybe noUced.
One is that the surplus be parceled ont among the
slates of the Union. This, thonzh It has hnn in
geniously argued, has not so approved itself to the
common sense of the people as now to call for
elaborate statement of reasons why it should not
be adopted. The public sense is shrewd ennurh to
see that a debtor owing a large sum upon interest,
which he must pay at short intervals, and soma
of the principal of which ue may pay off when
ever he pleases, and thut save interest, would
not oe aeemea a good mjnairer of affair if ha
should give awav or loan ou terms yielding no in
come and not likely to insure punctual repay
ment, the means which good luck or pru
dent conduct had put In his hands; and that
it wouio. oe wiser ior mm. with tbecaab he had. to
extinguish so much as becoald of the debt against
him. And the United States ha auch mean, and
owes such debts. It owes over a billion and a
?uaner of dollars, which is running upon interest,
t has the option to pay over three millions of the
debt whenever it pleases, it must pay the inter
est on tne principal unpaid, at snort interval. It
is net good sense, nor is it common Drudence to
give away or loan its means instead of using them
to pay tne oeots against if, wnne. because oi It

as with it to pay off and take up that debt. It ad

in this feature of it- lu the Judcmeatof this de
partment, it ia not a legitimate 1 auction of the
Federal government, te raise money by taxation to
be donated to the states, or to thus ase
money already raised in that way. Nor at
this uttered in ignorance or forzettulnesa nf
what men of might in the affairs and
councils of the Union hare heretofore done and
saia on tne subject, it is to be borne In mind
that they spoke and a ted upon an existing sur
plus not needed for any public use then sanctioned
bylaw; not upon a prospective one to be avoided
by legislation; and in view of the temptation with
that idle money, incapable of lawful use nnder
any existing law, held out for the broaching of

it is pernapa enougn ior tne present tnat tne
payable debt of the Union can take up all surplus
now existing or likely to arise for four jean to

If there be legislation on the tariff at this session.
an improvement might be made in the provision
regarding third-class or carpet wools, el 'her by
fixing one rate of duty for them, mrardlea of
value, or by having a broader coutraat between
the higher and lower classes. Now the duty is 2S
or S cent a pound, according as tne value of the
wool is over or under 12 cents a po md; and where
tba market value Is close te n cel. la. as II is now.
the temptation is strong to undervalue the wool,
so as to bring it in at the lower rate of duty.
