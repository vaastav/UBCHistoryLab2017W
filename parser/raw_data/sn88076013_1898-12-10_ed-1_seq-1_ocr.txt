Senator Vest Opens the Fight Against
4Imperlalisu).^

r*
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The first note
of the anti-expansionists was sounded in
thci senate by Senator7 Vest of 'Missouri
who introduced the
following joint reso
lution:
"That under the constitution of the
United States no power is given to tlie
federal government to "acquire territory
to be held and governed permanently as
colonies.
"The colonial system of European.1
nations cannot be established under our
present constitution but all territory
acquired by the government, except
such small amqunt as may be necessary
for coaling stations, correction of boun
daries and similar governmental pur
poses, must be acquired and governed
with the purpose of ultimately organiz
ing such territories into states, suitable
for admission into the Union."
To Become a Nation of Warriors.
A brief discussion of the navigation
laws was precipitated by the considera
tion of a bill amending those laws and
Mr. Vest expressed his apposition in
vigorous language. He criticized the
suggestion of the president in his mes
sage that our carrying trade be encour
aged by the payment of subsidies.
"Under the proposed policy of the ad
ministration." said Mr. Vest, "we are to
build a great navy. We are to cease to
be a nation of traders, and, under the
impulse of the policy of expansion, be
come a nation of warriors. It would
seem to me better first to build up a car
rying trade. I would also let our people,
through the beneficent effects of such
trade, buy where they can buy cheapest."
HOUSE SESSION BRIEF.
Adjourned Out of Respect to the Memory
of Deceased Members*
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The house was
in session less than half an hour when
the deaths of Representatives North
way of Ohio and Love of Mississippi
were announced and an adjournment
was taken out of respect to their mem
ory. The customary resolution for the
distribution of the president's message
to the several committees having juris
diction was adopted, and the deficiency
bill, carrying the appropriations for the
extraordinary expenses of the army^and
navy from Jan. 1 to July 1, 1800, was
reported. The report of the Hawaiian
commission, transmitted by the presi
dent, was laid before the house and re
ferred to the committee on territories.
BIG JOB OF CLEANING.
Havana Filthy and Unsanitary to an Un
conceivable Degree.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—Advices re­
ceived here in official quarters from
Havana depict the capital of Cuba as
filthy and unsanitary almost in an un
conceivable degree. This is especially
true of the poorer quarter and it is
likely that the cleaning up of the city is
going to be a work of the greatest mag
nitude. Unfortunately the reports ex?
press the belief that frosts will not come
this season to relieve the condition.
To Expedite Evacuation.
BERLIN, Dec. 6.—The Spanish Trans*
atlantic company has chartered the
North German Lloyd Steamship com
pany's vessels Darmstadt and Munichen
in order to expedite the evacuation of
Spanish troops in Cuba. The Darm

PAHIS, Dec. 7.—The peace of Paris is'
practically an accomplished fact. The
day's session disposed of, the essential
features of the treaty which will be em
bodied In the following eight articles:
First—The customary preface of
treaties, in the nature Of an expression
of amity and of hope for perpetual peace.
Second—The relinquishment by Spain
»f her sovereignty, over .Cuba,
Third —The withdrawal of the Span
ish troops.
Fourth—The relinquishmenbby Spain
of her sovereignty over Porto Rico.
Fifth—Spain's cession of the Philip
pines.
Sixth—The withdrawal of the Spanish
troops there.
Seventh—Payment by the United
Statesiof:$20,000,0d0 forthe Philippines.
Eighth—The provision for the "open
door" commercial policy in the Philip
pines.
An Interesting Documents
The rough draft of the treaty, which
may be considerably changed, covers
t1*" proposals. It makes a longdocu
me which Senator Cushman K. Davis
t.ie United States peace commission
8.iy« will be found to be one of the most
interesting papers of its character ever
written. So oompletely are the details
of the evacuation of the Philippines stip
ulated that a commission, such as ar
ranged for the Spanish withdrawal from
the West Indies, will be unnecessary.
Among the questions not yet settled,
however, aro the coaling station and re
ligious freedom in the Carolines, the
Spanish commission not having replied
to the American offer.
The Americans have agreed to trans*
port the Spanish prisoners home, in
cluding the garrison and sailors .at Ma
nila captured by Admiral Dewey and
General Merritt as well as the soldiers
and civilians held by the Filipinos,
whose return the Americans have guar
anteed. As compenstaion Spain promises
to liberate all Cuban, Porto Rican and
Philippine political prisoners.
Cheaper Than Feeding Them.
Spanish soldiers electing to remain in
the colonies may do so, but it is more a
matter of economy for the Americans to
return the others as they must be fed as
long as they are kept and Spain is un
able to bear the expense of the repatria
tion. Also the Americans have rejected
Spain's request for free shipping for 10
years in Cuban and Porto Rican waters,
they having given the Spanish commis
sioners such poor consolation as the lat
ter may derive from the permission to
re-apply when the diplomatic relations
havo been renewed for shipping conces
sions under the reciprocity scheme of
the Dingley law, for which Senor Du
puy de Lome was negotiating in Wash
ington when the war broke out. There
aTe still under discussion eight sec
ondary subjeots which the Spanish com
missioners broached last week, includ
ing the status of patents and copyrights.
The American commissioners have
handed to Senor Montero Rios a written
reply covering these questions.
NEWS FULLY CONFIRMED.
American Commission Had Instructions
to Hasten the End*
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The advices
from Paris to the effect that it might be
reasonably presumed that the peace
commissioners will be ready to sign a
treaty of peace within a day or two is
fully confirmed here. It is learned that
the' president's instructions to Judge
Day were to hasten the conclusion, and
to that end the American commissioners
have been authorized to limit the treaty
closely to protocol points, leaving other
matters, such as the acquisition of cable
stations and naval stations, to be dealt
with hereafter.

rency lias been maintained at tho world's
highest standard. Military servico under
a common liag and for a righteous cause
has strengthened the national spirit and
served to cement more closely than over
the fraternal bonds between every section
of tho country."
In reviewing tho controversy which led
up to tho war with Spain, the president
takes up tho thread of narrative whero it
terminated in his last annual meseage.
Ho concluded. "It was honestly duo to
our friendly relations with Spain that she
should bo given a reasonable chance to
realize her expectations of reform to
which sho had becomo irrevocably com
mitted." It bccamo evident, however,
that tho proposed plans were barren of
good results. No tangible roliof was
afforded the reconcontrados, among whom
tho ratoof mortality frightfully Increased
tho proffered expedient of zones of culti
vation proved illusory, and it was appar
ent that nothing savo tho physical ex-.
Laustion of Spain or tho Cubans, and tho
practical ruin of tho island of Cuba could
result from tho struggle then in progress.
At this critical juncture, tho destruction
of tho battleship "Maine" occurred, and
attention is given to that incident.
Resuming the war narrative tho presi
dent directs attention to the measures,
including the $50,000,000 appropriation for
national dofenso, taken to placo the coun
try on a war footing, and adds: "It is
sufficient to say that tho outbreak of war,
when it did come, found our nation not
unprepared to meet tho conflict."
Taking up chronologloally the events of
tho war, tho president roviows them care
fully. Tho first encounter was tho shell
ing of Matanzas on April 37. This was
followed by an engagement which was
"destined to mark a memorablo epoch In
maritimo warfare." This was Coiumo
doro Dewey's wondcrfoul victory at Ma
nila on May 1. "Tho effect of this remark
able victory," says the president, "upon
tho spirit of our people and upon the for
tunes of the war was instant. A prestige
of Invincibility thereby attached to our
arms, which continued throughout the
struggle."
Tho campaign of Santiago, resulting in
tho investment and capture of that city,
is referred to as a brilliant achievement
A brief riview is then presented of the de
cisive naval combat of the war, on July
8rd, resulting in the complete destruction
of Admiral Cervora's fleet.
The pcaco negotiations which followed
soon after the capitulation of Santiago,
and the preparation and signing of the
protocol are discussed at length. Refer
rcng to tho work of the peaco commission
ers at Paris, the president says:
"These negotiations have made hopeful
progress, so that I trust soon to ho able to
lay a definite treaty before the senato, with
a roview of tho steps leading to its sig
nature.
"I do not discuss at this time the gov
ernment or tenuro of the new possessions
which will come to us as the result of the
war with Spain. Such discussion will be
appropriate after tho treaty of pcaco shall
bo ratified. In tho meantime and until
tho congress has legislated otherwise, it
will bo my duty to continue tho military
governments which havo existed sinco our
occupation and give to tho people security
in lifo and property and encouragement
under a just and beneficent rule."
With the ono instance of the interrup
tion of Intercourse with Spain, the rela
tions of the United States with tho family
of nations during the past year has been
characterized by cordiality.
Thy president cxpccts that tho Nica
ragua canal commission will shortly be
able to report finally.
"I
havo not hesitated to cxpross my con
victions," says tho president, "that con
siil orations of expediency and International
policy as between the several governments
interested in tho construction and control
of an interoceanio canal by this route,
require the maintenance of tho status quo
until tho canal commission shall have re
ported, and tho United States congress
shall have had the opportunity to pass
finally upon tho wholo matter."
Tho president regards, in view of our
newly acquired interests in the Pacific
ocean, tho construction of suchamaritime
highway Is now more than ever Indlspen
siblo.
Alluding to the financial affairs of the
country, tho president says in part:
"In my judgment tho present condition
of the treasury amply justifies the imme
diate enactment of the legislation recom
mended a year ago, under whioh a portion
of tho gold holdings should bo placed in a
trust fnud from which greenbacks should
)o redeemed upon presentation, but when
once redeemed should not thereafter be
paid out except for gold.
"It is not to be Inferred that other legis
lation relating to our currency is not re
quired on the contrary, there Is an
obvious demand for it."
'J'lio recommendation mado by tho secro
liry of war for tho Increase of the regular
military establishment has tho president's
unqualified approval. He says that it is
his purpose to muster out tho entire vol
unteer army as soon as congress shall pro
vide for the increase of the rogular estab
lishment. Ho also recommends an
increase in the naval establishment.

Uilng New Files*
An expert in files has given some di
rections as to the best ways to use these
neoessaiy implements. He says that a
new file of very high temper should
first be used on brass or cast iron. After
the first sharpness is gone from it it
answers quite as well ior wrought iron
and steel. Sometimes new files will tear
the snifaoeof wrought iron and steel to
snch an extent as to become very an
noying and oauee additional work. Very
few meohanies thoroughly understand
the use of files and the methods by
which they are utilized to the greatest
advantage. Files bite rolled metal maoh
more quiokly and easily than oast, there
fore it requires a sharper file for brass
and
caEt
iron than for the wrought ar-
tides or for steel. If files are gradually
adapted to their best uses, they will
give muoh longer servioe than when
they are indiscriminately employed.

175
per cent of the animals
coming into the state are examined and
that those that are examined are fre
quently driven long distances into the

create and continue conditions of disease
that ought not to prevail. It fc, recom

To the dwellers on the Atlantic coast of
the United States Manila is very near the
antipodes. Traveling westward from the
eastern verge of the country to its west
ern boundary in the far Pacific a circuit
of almost half of the globe is made. Ex
cept in midwinter the sun rises'in East
port before it sets in Manila. In summer,
autum and spring it is daylight along the
eastern coast of the United States before
it is night on its western boundary. Eng
land, France and Germany also have ter
ritory so widely diffused throughout the
globe that the sun shines on some part of
it every hour of the
:4if2"
but, of course, in
contiguous territory the United States is
far ahead of all of these.
In area, exclusive of colonies, the Unit
ed States is the largest nation in the world
except China. It far exceeds in superfi
cial extent the empire of Alexander the
Great or the Rome of Caesar and Trajan.
It surpasses the domain of Charlemagne
or the territory of Charles V. exclusive
of his colonial possessions in America,
which were of indefinite extent and
which only technically belonged to Spain,
for no Spaniard in Charles' time had ever
seen any more than a small fragment of
the region that Spain claimed in the days
of Charles and of his son Philip II. It
exceeds the empire of Russia in Europe
In population the United States exceeds
every Christian nation of the globe if col
onial possessions are omitted. In [the
case of the United States the area and
population of the colonies are compara
tively trifling, but in that of the other
great Christian countries which have
been mentioned the area of the colonies
largely surpasses that of the mother
country, and in case of all of them ex
cept Germany they are exceeded by their
colonies in population. In wealth and
material strength the United States is far
better equipped than any other country
for getting detached territory if it should
ever engage in that task to any import
ant extent.
Imperial America, which comprises
more than half of the inhabited portion
of one continent, stretches its arms
across to another hemisphere. Its pos
sessions dot the world's greatest ocean
and extend from the arctic circle down to
a point close to the equator. Its colonies,
from the Alaskan islands of the north to
Hawaii, the Carolines and the Philippines
on the southern tier, are distributed with
in easy sailing distance of each other.
They cover all climates from the frigid
to the torid. When our new conquests
are occupied the stars and stripes will be
as familiar a sight on the islands of the
Pacific as is the union jack of England.
Unlike many of the colonies of England
and other nations, the United States' new
possessions will all be productive. They
will add largely to the country's wealth
and general resources. Settlers and
capital from all parts of the world will
flow into them immediately after the
United States gets them into its hands.
Through them the country acquires a
new credit and potency, and the advanta
ges of American civilization will be ex
tended half way around the globe.—
