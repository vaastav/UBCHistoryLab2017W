THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
The message of the President, which
was sent to Congress yesterday, will he
much more satisfactory to the people than
to the majority of the politicians and so
called leaders. The views he expresses on
the currency are not likely to find much
favor in a body that less than a year ago
sent him a hill for his signature in which
directly opposite principles were main
tained, and which he returned to them with
!" "ondemnation. Of course there can be
no hope v- urospect of agreement between
those ho fa 01 wore paper money on the
one hand and on the other those who de
sire to return to the universal inimoy nf the
world. The two ideas are as opposite as
night and day, and the President need
not hope that that portion of his message
which hears ou this subject will receive the
approval ol those who believe that the sole
remedy for the distresses under which we
labor consists in turning the steam on the
greenback presses, stamping out a couple
of hundred more million promises to pay.and
ultimately making money as plenty as it was
under the late Southern Confederacy or in
the happy i-le of Ilayti at the present time.
It will be seen that the President places
the whole responsibility of returning to a
healthy condition of affairs exactly where
it belongs in Congress. Congress will
1 ot like this, wc suppose, but there the
first steps must be taken and nowhere else.
He makes several recommendations, look
ing to the appreciation of the national cur
rency by the repeal of the legal tender
clause, with certain conditions and restric
tions, and to the accumulation of gold. A
day must be definitely set for return to
specie payments, and then free banking.
This portion of the message will undoubt
edly be popular, except among those who
are specially interested in retaining their
present monopoly. But we have little
faith that the suggestions of the President
will be adopted, or that, in fact, there will
be any agreement on the whole subject
within the next ninety days.
The President strikes the keynote of the
situation when he says that some means
should be taken to reconcile labor and
capital and to induce the employment of
the workingmen. Wc have again and
again pointed out that the causes of the
recent reverses at the polls were attributa
ble solely to the hard times; that the duty
of Congress at the present time is to so
shape legislation that it will revive the in
dustry of the country and put the working-
men to work. The President in his mes
sage says: "Our commeree should be cn
"couraged ; American ship building and
"carrying capacity increased ; foreign
"markets sought for products of the
"soil or the manufactories." And again:
"I have stated that three elements of pros
" perity to the nation, capital, labor, skilled
"and unskilled, remain to us. To direct
"the employment of these is a problem de
" serving the most serious attention of Con
"gress. If employment can be given to
"all the labor offering itself, prosperity
" necessarily follows. I have expressed
" the opinion and repeat it, that the first
" requisite to the accomplishment of this
"end is the substitution of a sound cur
"rency in place of one of a fluctuating
"value. This secured, there are many in
" terests that might be fostered to the great
' ' profit of both labor and capital. How to
"induce capital to employ labor is the
" question. The subject of cheap trans
"portation has occupied the attention of
" Congress. Much new light on this
"question will, without doubt, be given by
" the committee appointed by the last Con
" gress to investigate and report upon this
"subject."
"We have already alluded to this subject
of cheap transportation in these columns,
and pointed out that if Congress would
only boldly carry out the suggestions and
recommendations of Sir. Windom's report,
the expenditure would in a few years come
back ten-fold to the Government, and be of
incalculable benefit to the producer of the
"West and the consumer of the East. But
as the bank monopolies stand in the way
of measures calculated to redress the finan
cial disorders of the country, so the rail
road monopolies block the construction of
the internal water lines of communication,
and their newspaper organs have been set
upon us to denounce and ridicule the pro
ject. Let us wait and see who are their
champions in Congress.
AVhat may be characterized as the politi
cal portion , of the message will be aeccptcd
by all who have the least conception of
American citizenship as the language of a
patriot rather than of a partisan. The
troubles and dissensions in the Southern
States are characterized in terms the truth
of which must be acknowledged by every
impartial man. and the whole cause of the
misrule and outrages that disgrace and de
grade that section is laid here in the single
sentence: "Treat the negro as a citizen and
" a voter as he is and must remain, and soon
' parties will be divided, not on the color
" line, but on principle. Then we shall have
"no complaints of sectional prejudice."
To every Southern Republican who has for
years been hunted, persecuted and threat
cned vtith death for opinion's sake, the
ringing ords "while I remain Executive,
"all the laws of Congress and the provi
sions of the Constitution, including the re-
" cent amendments added thereto, will be
"enforced with vigor, but with regret that
"they should have added one jot or
" tittle to executive duties or powers," will
carry cheer and consolation.
The message is probably the best and
most statesmanlike the President has writ
ten. Cairn, dignified, with little in it which
can be said to have been' written for effect
or to catch the passing chee, its utterances
are those of a man who evidently feels all
that be says. He has given a policy to the
Republican party in Congress something
which they sadly needed. "Will they come
up to it?
THE ARKANSAS QUESTION.
President Grant's message embraces one
concise point which at once, disposes of the
pretentions of the Garland revolutionists
in Arkansas to recognition as the legitimate
officials of that State. The point alluded
to is to be found in reference to the fact
that "article 13 of the constitution of that
"State (which was adopted in 18C8, and
"trpon the approval of which by Congress
"the State was restored to representation
"as one of the States of the Union) pro
' Tides in effect that before any amend
"meats proposed to this constitution shall
"becomeapart thereof they shall be passed
"by two successive assemblies, and then
"submitted to and ratified by a rmjor
"ity of the electors of the State vot
"ing thereon." The only deduction
to be made from this pointed cxplana
tion is that the pledge made to Con
gress and to the nation when Arkan
sas was readmitted under the reconstruc
tion acts, that her reconstructed consti
tution shall be carefully obeyed, has
been violated. But i his violation of sacred
pledges might have been expected from
men who arejso bitterly disposed towards
the Government, and whose animosity to
wards the Republican party has led them
into murderous excesses. They began the
conspiracy which has ended in the over
throw of the legal government of the
State with the same cool deliberation that
characterized the steps taken by them
when preparing for the war of seces
sion. They began, under the recreant
Baxter, to arrange for it by virtually
reorganizing the Legislature. In doing
this they appointed men as members of that
body, in an illegal manner, who were the
mere tools of the Baxter-Garland ring. It
was from this bogus body that the call for
the constitutional convention came. They
knew that the call was unconstitutional,
that it was in violation of the provisions of
the constitution quoted by the President,
because the question of their power to do
this treasonable act had leen publicly dis
cussed, and, further, because in-the North
Carolina case, two years ago, it had been
condemned as revolutionary by the best
legal minds in the country. But the con
vention itself proved to be as regardless of
law and justice as the Legislature which
originated it. It boldly assumed legislative
powers in repealing the election laws
which were provided for under the con
stitution of 18G8, and proceeded with un
warranted and arbitrary power to uudo all
that had been done by the reconstruction
convention to secure the re-admission of
the State into the Union. The natural
consequence of all this is to be found in the
fraudulent character of tUe election returns
by which these White Leaguers Mid their
co-conspirators claim the ratification of
their bogus constitution by the people.
The entire vote of the State, it must be
remembered, is less than 80,000, of which
from 48,000 to 50,000 arc Republicans; but
the returns to which we refer, on which
the conspirators claim the adoption of their
constitution, allege that but few Republi
can votes were cast, and were so manipu
lated as to present a showing that the
vote for the constitution was almost unani
mous. The duty of Congress, in view of these
indisputable facts, is plain. No time is to
be lost in its performance. The next
House, we know, is Democratic, and will
hasten to ratify all that has been done by
these Arkansas traitors in behalf of that
part-. AVe have the power, now to restore
good government and legal government,
and at the same time to .rescue a Republi
can State from the gnfsp of our enemies.
We must not hesitate to do it, and to do it
without delay. Congress must empower
or direct the President, by the expression
of its opinion, to recognize the legal gov
ernment and to reinstate the legal officers
of the State under that government in the
offices of which they are now deprived by
the effect of one of the most nefarious and
treasonable plots ever developed in the
history of American politics. The Presi
dent has sounded the alarm, and Congress
should not, must not, falter.
THE REPORT OF TEE DISTRICT
COMMISSIONERS.
We publish this morning the report of
the Commissioners of the District, addressed
to the President, and accompanied by those
of all the municipalofficers who have served
under the Commission. The report is a
clear, terse, well-arranged, comprehensive
and able document
After quoting the provisions of law pre
scribing their duties, and the character of
the report required from them, the Commis
sioners furnish a financial statement, from
which it appears that the total receipts of
the District treasury from all sources, dur
ing their term of office, up to December 1,
1874, aggregate the sum of $ 3,03G,188.C3,
while their expenses during the same pe
riod, including payment of interest on the
funded debt, payment of temporary loans
incurred by the late District government
for which securities had been pledged, pay
ment of employees and laborers of the late
government and of the Board of Public
Works and of the workingmen of con
tractors, reimbursement of the United
States for the amount advanced for interest
on the District debt, payment of judgments
against the late District government, sala
ries and expenses of the board of audit, ex
penses of the present government, includ
ing salaries and expenditures for public
schools, police and fire departments, gas,
&C have aggregated $2,917,329.20, leaving
a balance of csh on luind December 1,
1874, of $168,809.45. Accompanying their
report nn itemized statement is furnished of
all these receipts and expenditures.
The Commissioners deposited in the
United States Treasury all funds received
from all sources whatsoever, and no money
was drawn therefrom except upon a war
rant naming in each individual case the
amount to be paid, the person to be paid,
and the account on which paid ; and every
such warrant was signed by the accounting
officers of the Districr and by one of the
Commissioners, after careful examination
and approval in each instance of the claim
or account on which it was based, both by
the accounting officers of the District and
by the Commissioners. To the Treasurer
of the United States and his subordinates,
for the laborious task thus involved, which
was voluntarily assumed by them at the in
stance of the Commissioners, the Govern
ment and the people of the District arc
therefore much indebted, and we know
that their services and kindness were
highly appreciated by the Commissioners.
After thus stating their actual receipts
and actual expenses during the past five
months, the Commissioners furnish esti
mates of receipts and expenses from De
cember first to the end of tho fiscal year,
June 30, 1875, the details of which are sup
plied by the accompanying documents from
the various municipal officers. It appears
that the total receipts wluch may be ex
pected between the dates above mentioned
are $l,53o,G00, while the estimated ex
penses for the present organization and
scale of salaries, including expenditures
by the Board of Health, by the water, fire,
police and school departments, expendi
tures upon the public improvements, ex
penditures for repairs, for rent, for interest
on the funded debt, other than the three
sixty-five bonds, including interest due July
1, 1875,and, indeed, for every municipal pur
pese for which an estimate can bf. made,
aggregate $1,572,00(5.52. So that the
cash on hand on December 1, 1874,
and the receipts estimated up to June 30,
1875, exceed by $132,393.93 all estimated
expenses between December 1 and June
30, 1875, including interest payable in July,
1875.
The report next gives the clearest expo
sition of the funded debt of the -District of
Columbia, (including that of tho late Board
of Public Works,) and of the late jcorpora
tions of Washington and Georgetown,
which has ever been furnished to the pub
lic The amounts outstanding of the nu
merous classes of securities ot the late cor
porations and of the District of Columbia
are severally stated. It is shown that the
bonds of the late corporations and of the
District, issued prior to July 1, 1874, after
deducting those bonds which are now in
the hands of the Commissioners of the Dis
trict and of the sinking fund, amounted
to $8,883,910.43. There have been issued
under the act of Congress of June 20, 1874.
3-C5 bonds amounting to $2,038,168:73,
and the outstanding certificates of the
board of audit, not yet converted, but con
vertible into such bonds, amount to $4.
770,558.45; while unadjusted claims pend
ing before that Board, and upon which
certificates thus convertible may hereafter
be issued, are estimated at $3,147,787.48.
When from the aggregate debt thus
stated there shall have been deducted the
excess of uncollected special improvement
assessments above the purposes to which
such assessments are in the first instance ap
plicable, which excess amounts to $1,014,
054.37. and there shall also have been de
ducted the sum of $75,000 represented by
Chi sapeake and Ohio canal bonds in tho
hands of the commissioners of the sinking
fund, and $59,000 represented by Wash
ington and Alexandria railroad bonds,
which are in litigation, there will remain
as the actual debt of the District, less said
assets, the sum of $13,994,013.24. But
inasmuch as the act of Congress of
June 20, 1874, contemplates an apportion
ment between the United States Gov
crnment and the District of Columbia
in respect of the payment of the three
sixty five bonds, the Commissioners well
say that the aggregate sum above stated
" includes something more than the funded
"debt chargeable exclusively to the Dis
"trictof Columbia." The aggregate sum
stated is to be reduced to the extent of the
amount to be apportioned to the United
Stales Government. The Commissioners
remark that, "with such an adjustment,
"and the revaluation of taxable prop
" erty of the District so as to equalize the
"assessments, aided by an economical ad
" ministration of whatever form of govcrn
" ment Congress may establish, the property-holders
of the District will be largely
"relieved ol their present unequal and
"onerous taxes. Under such conditions
"the debt of the District will practically
' cease being a burden to the people of the
" District. With a reasonable sinking-fund
" for the payment of the principal the debt
" will "iw rapidly extinguished."
The financial statements and conclusions
above given are furnished by able men,
who possess not only unimpeachable in
tegrity, but also experience and skill in
business and In public affairs. The exhibit
therefore is one from which" this commu
nity may justly derive great encourage
ment. The report of the Commissioners next
furnishes a synopsis of the reports of every
one of the fourteen municipal officers which
accompany the communication of the Com
missioners to the President. More fully
than is usual in official reports, the Com
missioners have incorporated into their own
a concise statement of the information fur
nished In detail by their subordinates.
Thus, the report of the Commissioners
gives a separate summary of the transac
tions and condition of each separate office
and department. Of these accompanying
reports, those upon financial matters will
probably attract most attention. They de
serve it, for they are made by men trained
to their work and with an established and
honorable standing before the community.
The report of the comptroller is made by
Fitzhugh Coyle, who for manj- years has
been president of the National Bank of the
Republic The auditor's report is made by
John T. Vinson, trained for his office by
many years' experience in a responsible
position in the Treasury Department.
The report of the sinking fund
commissioners is made by William W.
Corcoran, Henry 3L Sweeney, president of
the Farmers' and Mechanics' bank; Lewis
J. Davis, a banker of experience and sa
gacity, and Moses Keller, for many years
cashier of the National Metropolitan Bank.
The reports of the Commissioners of the
District, of the commissioners of the sink
ing fund, of the comptroller, and, indeed,
of all the municipal officers, will be found
to be thorough and harmonious with each
other. They show that under the admin
istration of the Commissioners the govern
ment of the District has had a competent
executive head exercising general direc
tion, and that the several departments of
the government have, with confidence in
that head and with confidence in each
other, co-operated with each other.
The District has been well governed by
the Commissioners. Our people owe a debt
of gratitude to the three gentlemen, citi
zens of distant States, who have adminis
tered the affairs of this municipality with
so much economy, so much efficiency and
such hearty interest in the welfare of the
community. Had their own homes been
here they could not have labored with more
fidelity or greater interest in their work.
And in view of the experience they now
have had in the management of our munic
ipal affairs at a trying time; in view of
their acquaintance with our people, that is
an honorable tribute rendered to the District
of Columbia by the Commissioners in say
ing, in the closing words of their report,
that it is "by its beauty and adornment
"worthy of remaining the capital of the
"nation, and is justly regarded with pride
"by the country."

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
(Continued rem Tirtt Page.)
country, and by assentlrg to a certain change
in the Jurisdiction of courts In the latter. A
copy of the proclamation upon these subjects
Is herewith communicated. There has been
no material change In our relations with the
Independent States of this hemisphere, wh'ch
were formerly under the dominion of Spain.
TUE MEXICAN rnONTIEE.
Marauding on the frontiers between Mexico
and Texas still frequently takes place, despite
the vigilance of the civil and military authority
in that quarter. The difficulty of checking
such trespasses along the course of a river of
such length a the ltio Grande, and so often
fordable, is obvious. It is hoped that the
efforts of this Government will be seconded
by those of Mexico to the effectual suppres
sion of these acts of wrong. From a report
upon the condition of the business before the
American and Mexican joint claims commis
sion made by the agent on the part of the
United States, and dated .October 23, 1874, it
appears that of the 1,017 claims Sled on the
part of citizens of the United States, 4S3 had
been finally decided, and 75 were in the hands
of the umpire, leaving 402 to be disposed of;
and of the 90S claims filed against the United
States, 72G bad been finally decided, one was
before the umpire and 271 remained to be dis
poned of Since the date of such report other
claims have been disposed of, reducing somc
nhat the number still pending, and others
have been passed upon by the arbitrators. It
has become apparent, in view of these figures
and of the fact that the work devolving on the
umpire Is particularly laborious, that the com
mission would be unable to dispose of the en
tire number ol claims pending prior to the
1st day of February, 1875, the date fixed for its
expiration.
Negotiations are pending looking to the se
curing of the results of the decisions which
have been reached and to a further extension
of the commission for a limited time, which it
is confidently hoped will sctllce to bring all the
bnslness now before it to a final close. The
strife in the Argentine Republic is to be de
plored, both on account of the parties thereto,
and from the probable effects on the interests
of thofe engaged in the trade to that quarter,
of whom the United fctates are amongthc prin
cipal. As jet, so far as I am aware, there has
been no iolation of our neutrality righti.which,
as well as our duties in that respect. It shall be
my endeavor to maintain and observe.
It Is with regret I announce that no further
payment has been received from the Govern
ment of Venezuela on account of awards in
favor of citizens of the United States. Hopes
have been entertained that if that Republic
could escape both foreign and civil war for a
few ) ears, Its great natural resources would
enable It to honor its obligations. Though it
If- cow understood to be at peace with other
countries, a serious Insurrection is reported to
le in rogress in an Important region of that
Republic.
This may be taken advantage of as another
reason to delay the payment of the dues of our
citizens. The deplorable strife in
continues without anv marked change In the rel
ative advantages of the contending forces. The
insurrection continues, but Spain has gained
no superiority. Six jcars of strife give to the
insurrection a significance which caunot be
denied. Iisduration, and t lie tenacity of its ad
herents, together with the absence of manifest
ed power of suppression on the part of Spain ,
cannot be controverted, and may make some pos
itive steps on the part of other Powers a matter
of self-necessity. I bad confidently hoped, at
this time, to be able to announce the arrange
ment of some of the Important questions
between this Government and that of Spain,
but the negotiations have been protracted. The
unhappy Intestine dissensions of Spain com
mand onr profound sympathy, and must be
accepted as perhaps a cause of some delay.
An early settlement, in part at least, of the
questions between the Governments is hoped.
In the meantime, awaiting the results of
immediately pending negotiations. I defer
a further and fuller communication on the
subject of the relations of this country and
Spain. I have again to call the attention of
Congress to the unsatisfactory condition of the
existing laws with reference to
EXPATRIATION,
and the election of nationality. Formerly,
amid conflicting opinions and decisions, It was
difficult to exactly determine how far the doc
trine of perpetual allegiance was appllcablo to
citizens of the United States. Congress, by
the act of the 27th of July, 1868, asserted the
abstract right of expatriation as a fundamen
tal principle of this Government. Notwith
standing such assertion and the necessity of
frequent application of the principle, no legis
lation has been had defining what acts or for
malities shall work expatriation, or when a
citizen shall be deemed to have renounced or
to have lost his citizenship. The Importance
of such definition is obvious. The representa
tives of the United States In foreign countries
are continually called upon to lend their aid
and the protection of the United States to per
sons concerning the good faith or the reality of
whose citlzcnsnlp there is at least great ques
tion. In some cases the provisions of (he trea
ties furnish some guide; in others, It seems
left to the perron claiming the benefits of citi
zenship, while living in a foreign country, con
tributing in no manner to the performance of
the duties of a citizen Of the United States,
and without Intention at any time to return
and undertake those duties to use the claims to
citizenship of the United States simply as a
shield from the performance of the obliga
tions ot a citizen elsewhere. The status of
children born of American parents residing In
a foreign country; of American women who
have married aliens; of American citizens re
siding abroad, where such question Is not regu
lated by treaty, are all sources of frequent
difficulty and discission. Legislation on these
and similar questions, and particularly defin
ing when and under what circumstances ex
patriation can be accomplished or It is to be
presumed, is especially needed. In this con
nection I earnestly call the attention of Con
gress to the difficulties arising from fraudu
lent naturalization
The United States, wisely, freely and liber
ally offers Its citizenship to all who may come
In good faith to reside within Ks limits, on
their complying with certain prescribed rea
sonable and simple formalities and conditions.
Among the highest duties of the Government
Is that to afford firm, efficient, and equal pro
tection to all Its citizens, whether native born
or naturalized.
Care should be taken that a right, carrying
with It such support from the Government,
should not be fraudulently obtained, and
should be bestowed only upon full proof of a
compliance with the law, and yet, frequent in
stances are brought to tho attention of the
Government of Illegal and fraudulent natural
ization, and of the unauthorized use of cer
tificates thus improperly obtained. In some
cases the fraudulent character of the natural
ization has appeared upon the face of the cer
tificate Itself ; In others, examination discloses
that the holder had not compiled with the law,
and in others, certificates have been obtained
where the persons holding them not only were
cot entitled to be naturalized, but had not even
been within the United States at the time or
the pretended naturalization.
Instances of each of these classes of fraud
are discovered at our legations, where the
certificates of naturalization are presented,
either for the purpose of obtaining passports or
in demanding the protection of the legation.
When the fraud is apparent on the face of such
certificates they are taken up by the represent
atives of the Government and forwarded to
the Department of State. But even then the
record of the court In which the fraudulent
naturalization occurred remains, and duplicate
certificates are readily obtainable. Upon the
presentation of these for the issue of passports
or in demanding protection of the Government
the fraud sometimes escapes notice, and such
certificates are not unfrequently used la trans
actions of bnslness to the deception and injury
of innocent parties. Wl'hout placing any ad
ditional obstacles in the way of the obtalnmcnt
of citizenship by the worthy and well-Intcn.
tloned foreigner who comes in good faith to cast
his lot vt 1th ours, I earnestly recommend further
legislation to punish fraudulent naturalization
and to secure the ready cancellation of the record
of every naturalization made in fraud. Since
my last annual message the exchange has been
made of the ratification of treaties of extra
dition with Belgium, Ecuador, Peru, and Sal
vador; also of a treaty of commerce and navi

The report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
which, by law, is made directly to Congress,
and forms no part of this message, will show
the receipts and expenditures of the Govern
ment for the last fiscal year; the amount re
ceived from each source of revenue, and the
amount paid out for each of the Departments
of Government. It will be observed from this
report that the amount of receipts over expen
ditures has been but 2,344 ,882.30 for the fiscal
year ending June SO, 1874, and that for the
current fiscal year the estimated receipts over
expenditures will cot much exceed cine mil
lions of dollars. In view of the large national
debt existing, and the obligation to add one
per cent, per annum to the sinking fund a
sum amounting now to over $34,000,000 per
annum I submit whether revenues should
cot be Increased or expenditures diminished to
reach this amount of surplus. Not to provide
for the sinking fund is a partial failure to com
ply with the contracts and obligations of the
Government. At the last session of Congress
a very considerable reduction was made la
rates of taxation and in the number of articles
submitted to taxation ; the question may
well be asked whether or not, in some, in
stances, unwisely.
In connection with this subject, too, I ven
ture the opinion that the means of collecting
the revenue, especially from Imports, have
been so embarrassed by legislation as to make
it questionable whether or not large amounts
are cot lost by failure to collect, to the direct
loss of the Treasury, and to the prejudice of
the interests of honest Importers and tax
payers. The Secretary of the Treasury, in his
report, favors legislation looking to an early
return to specie payments, thus supporting
views previously expressed In this message.
He also recommends economy In appropria
tions; calls attention to the loss of revenue
fiom repealing the tax on tea and coffee, with
out benefit to the consumer; recommends an
increase of ten cents a gallon on whisky, and
further, that ro modification be made In the
backing and currency bill passed at the last
cession of 'Congress unless modification should
become necessary by reason of the adoption of
measures for returning to specie payments. In
these recommendations I cordially join.
I would suggest to Congress the propriety
of readjusting the tariff, co as to Increase the
revenue, and, at the same time, decrease the
number of articles upon which duties are
levied. Those articles which enter into our
manufactures and are cot produced at home
it seems to me should be entered free. Thoso
articles of manufacture which we produce a
constituent part, but do not produce the
whole, that part which we do not produce
should enter free also. I will instance fine
wool, dyes, Ac. These articles must be im
ported to form a part of the manufacture of
the higher grades of woolen goods. Chemi
cals, used as djes, compounded In medicines,
and used in various wavs In manufactures,
come under this class. The introduction free
of duty of such wools as we do not produce
would stimulate the manufacture of goods re
quiring the use of those we do produce,
and, therefore, would be a benefit to home
production. There are many articles entering
into "home manufactures" which we do not
produce ourselves the tariff upon which in
creases the cost of producing the manufac
tured article. All corrections in this regard
are In the direction of bringing labor and
capital in harmony with each other, and of
supplying one of the elements of prosperity
so much needed.
THE WAS DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Secretary of War, here
with attached and .brmlng a part of this mes
sage, gives all the information concerning the
operations, wants and necessities of the army,
and contains many suggestions and recom
mendations which I commend to your special
attention. There is no class of Government
employees who are harder worked than the
army officers and men none who perform
their tacks more cheerfully and efficiently and
under circumstances of greater privations and
hardships. Legislation is desirable to render
more cllicient this branch of tho public ser
vice. All the recommendations of the Secre
tary of War I regard as judicious, and I espe
cially commend to jour attention the follow
ing:"Ttccomol'datlonof Government arsenals;
the restoration of mileage to officers traveling
under orders; the exemption of money received
from the sale oi subsistence stores from being
covered into the Treasury; the use of appro
priations for the purchase of subsistence stores
without waiting for the beginning of the fiscal
year for which "the appropriation is made; for
additional appropriations for the collection of
torpedo material; for Increased appropriations
for the manufacture of arms; for relieving
the various States from Indebtedness for
arms charged to them during the rebellion;
for dropping officers from the rolls of the army
vt Ithout trial for the offence of granting pay
more than once for the same period; for the
discouragement of the plan to pay soldiers by
checks, and for the establishment of a profes
sorship of rhetoric and English literature at
West Point. The reasons fortbese recommend
ations are obvious, and are set forth suffi
ciently in the report attached. I also recom
mend that the tM( of the staff corps of the
army be fixed where this has not already
been done so that promotions may be made
and vacancies filled as they occur in each grade
when reduced below the number to be fixed by
law. The necessity for such legislation ts
specially felt now in the pay department. The
cumber of officers In that department Is below
the number adequate to the performance of
the duties required of them by law.
THE NAVY DEPARTMENT.
The efficiency of the navy has been largely
increased during the last year. Under the im
pulse of the foreign complications which threat
ened us at the commencement of the last ses
sion of Congress most of our efficient wooden
ships were put in condition for immediate ser
vice, and the repairs of our iron-clad fleet were
pushed with the utmost vigor. The result fs
that most of these are now In an effective state,
and need only to be manned and put in com
mission to go at once Into service Some of
the new sloops authorized by Congress are al
ready In commission, and most of the remain
der are launched and wait only the completion
of their machinery to enable them to take
their places as part of our effective force. Two
irou torpedo ships have been completed during
the last year, and four of our large double
turrcted lron-clads are now undergoing re
pairs. When these are finished, everything
that is useful of our navy as now authorized
will be In condition for service, and with the
advance in the science of torpedo warfare the
American navy,comparatlvely small as ltis,will
be found at any time powerful for the pur
poses of a peaceful cation. -Much has also
been accomplished durlug the year In aid of
science, and to increase the sum of general
knowledge, and further the interests of com
merce and civilization. Extensive and much
needed soundings have been made for hydro
graphic purposes and to fix the proper routes
ol ocean telegraphs. Further surveys of the
great Isthmus have been undertaken and com
pleted, and two vessels of the navy are now
emplqjed, in conjunction -with those of Eng
land, France, Germany and Russia, in observa
tions connected with the transit of Venus, so
useful and Interesting to the scientific world.
The estimates for this branch of the public
service do not differ materially from those of
last year, those for the general support of the
service being somewhat less, and those for
permanent improvements at the various sta
tions rather larger than the corresponding es
timate made a year ago. The regular main
tenance and a steady increase In the efficiency
of this most Important arm in proportion to
the growth of our maritime Intercourse and
interests ts recommended to the attention of
Congress.
The use of the navy In time of peace might
be further utilized by a di'ect authorization of
the employment of naval vessels in explora
tions and surveys of the supposed navigable
waters of other nationalities on this continent,
specially the tributaries of the two great rivers
of South America, the Oronoco and the Ama
zon. Nothing prevents, under existing laws,
such exploration except that expenditures
must be made in such expeditions beyond those
usually provided for In the appropriations.
The field designated Is unquestionably one of
interest and one capable of large development
of commercial Interests advantageous to the
peoples reached, and to those who may estab
lish relations with mem. taucatiou or me
people entitled to exercise the right of fran
chise I regard essential to general prosperity
everywhere, and especially so la republics,
where birth, education or previous condition
does not enter into account in giving suf

TIIE POST OFFICE
Is the great agent of education over our vast
territory, the rapidity with which new section's
arc beingscttled thus increasing the carrying
the malls in a more rapid ratio than the Increase
of tecelpts is not alarming. The report of the
Postmaster General, herewith attached, shows
that there was an increase of revenue in his
Department in 1ST3 over the previous year of
1,674,411, and an increase of cost of carrying
tie mails and paying the employees of $-1,011,-4C8.91.
The report of the Postmaster General
gives interesting statistics of his Department,
and compare them with the corresponding
statistics of a year ago, shows a growth in
every branch of the Department.
A postal convention has been concluded
with New South Wales, an exchange of postal
cards established with Switzerland, and the
negotiations pending for several years past with
France have terminated in a convention with
that country, which went into effect last Au
gust. An International Postal Congress was
convened In Berne, Switzerland, In September
lait, at which the United States was repre
sented by an officer of the Post Office Depart
ment ot mnch experience and of qualification
for the position. A convention for the estab
lishment of an International postal union
was agreed upon and signed by the delegates
of the countries represented, subject to the ap
proval of the proper authorities of those coun
tries. I respectfully direct your attention to
the report of the Postmaster General and to
his suggestions In regard to an equitable ad
justment of the question of compensation to
railroads for carrying the malls.
LOUISIANA.
Tour attention will be drawn to the unsettled
condition bf affairs lc some of the Southern
States. On the 14th of September last the
Governor of Louisiana called upon me, as pro
vided by the Constitution and laws of the Uni
ted States, to aid In suppressing domestic vio
lence in that State. This call was made In
view of a proclamation Issued on that day by
D. B. Penn, claiming that he was elected
Lieutenant Governor In 1872, and calling upon
the militia of the State to arm, assemble, and
drive from power the usurpers, as he desig
nated the officers of the State government. On
the next day I Issued my proclamation com
manding the Insurgents to disperse within five
days from the date thereof, and supsequently
learned that on that day they had taken forci
ble possession of the State House. Steps were
taken by me to support the existing and re
cognized State government; but before the ex
piration of the five days the Insurrectionary
movement was practically abandoned, and
the officers of the State government, with some
minor exceptions, resumed their powers and
duties.
Considering that the present State adminis
tration of Louisiana has been the only govern
ment In that State for nearly two years, that
It has becu tacitly acknowledged and acqui
esced In by Congress, and more than once ex
pressly recognized by me, I regarded it as my
ciear duty, when legally called upon for that
purr cm, to prevent its overthrow by an arme
mob under pretense of fraud and irregularity
In the election of 1872. I bare heretofore
called the attention of Congress to this sub
ject, stating that on account of the frauds and
forgeries committed at said election, and be
cause it appears that the returns thereof were
never legally canvassed, it was impossible to
tell thereby who were chesen; but from the
best sources of information at toy command I
haveiilways believed the present State officers
received a majority of the legal votes actually
cast at that election. I repeat what I said in
my special message of February 23, 1873, that
In the event of co action by Congress I must
continue to recognize the government hereto
fore recognized by me.
KU-KIXr AND WHITE LEAGUE OUTRAGES.
I regret to say that with preparations for
the late election decided Indications appeared
in some localities in the Southern States of a
determination, by acts of violence and intimida
tion, to deprive citizens of the freedom of the
ballot because of their political opinions.
Bands of men, masked and armed, made their
appearance; White Leagues and other societies
were formed; large quantities of arms and
ammunition were imported and distributed to
these organizations: military drills with
menacing demonstrations were held, and, with
all these, murders enongh were committed to
spread terror among those whose political
action was to be suppressed, if possible, by
these Intolerant and criminal proceedings. In
some places colored laborers were compelled
to vote according to the wishes of their em
ployers under threats of discharge -If they
actea otherwise, and there are, too, many in
stances in which, when these threats were dis
regarded, they were remorselessly executed by
those who made them.
I understand that the fifteenth amendment
to the Constitution was made to prevent this
and like state of things, and the act of May
31, 1870, with amendments, was passed to en
force its provisions the object of both being
to guarantee to all citizens theright to vote and
to protect them in the free enjoyment of that
right. Enjoined; by the Constitution "to take
care that the laws be faithfully executed,"
and convinced by undoubted evidence that
violations of said act had been committed, and
that a widespread and flagrant disregard of it
was contemplated, the proper officers were in
structed to prosecute the offenders, and troops
were statfoned at convenient points to aid these
officers, if necessary, in tre performance of
their official duties. Complaints are made of
this interference by Federal authority, but if
said amendment and act do not provide for
such Interference, under the circumstances as
above stated, then they are without meaning,
force, or eflect, and the whole scheme of col
ored enfranchisement Is worse than mockery
and little better than a crime. Possibly, Con
gress may find it due to truth and justice to
ascertain, by means of a committee, whether
the alleged wrongs to colored citizens for polit
ical purposes are real Qr the reports thereof
were manufactured for the occasion. The
whole number of troops in the States of Louisi
ana , Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina,
North Carolina,Kentucky,Tennessee,Arkansas,
Mississippi, Maryland and Virginia at the times
of the election were 4,082. This embraces the
garrisons of all the forts from the Delaware to
the Gulf of Mexico.
ARKANSAS.
Another trouble has arisen in Arkansas.
Article 13 of the constitution of that State
(which was adopted in 1SG8, and upon the ap
proval of which by Congress the State was re
stored to representation as one of the States of
the Union) provides in effect that before any
amendments proposed, to this constitution
shall become a part thereof tbey shall be
passed by two successive Assemblies,
and then submitted to, and ratified by
a majority of the electors of the State
voting thereon. On the 11th of May,
1874, the Governor convened an extra session
of the General Assembly of the State, which,
on the 18th day of the same month, passed an
act providing for a convention to frame a new
constitution. Pursuant to this act, and at an
election held on the 30th of June, 1874, the
convention was approved, and delegates were
chosen thereto, who assembled on the 14th
of last July and formed a new constitution, the
schedule of which provided for the election of
an entire new set of State officers In a manner
contrary to the then existing election laws of
the State. On the 13th or October 1874, this
constitution, as therein provided, was submit
ted to the people for their approval or rejec
tion, and according to the election returns was
approved by a large majority of those qualified
to vote thereon, and at the same election per
sons were chosen to fill all the State, county
and township offices. The Governor elected
in 1872 for the term of four years turned over
his office to the Governor chosen under the new
constitution, whereupon the Lieutenant Gover
nor, also elected in 1872 for a term of four
years, claiming to act as Governor, and alleging
that said proceedings by which the new con
stitution was made and a new set of officers
elected, were uncocstitutional,Ulrgal and void,
called upon me, as provided In section 4, arti
cle 4, of the Constitution, to protect the State
against domestic violence. As Congress Is now
investigating the political affairs of Arkansas,
I have declined to Interfere. The whole sub
ject of
EXECUTIVE INTERFERENCE
with the affairs of a State is repugnant to pub
lic cpinlon, to the feeling of those who, from
their official capacity, must be used In such in
terposition, and to him or those who must di
rect. Unless roost clearly on the side of law,
such Interference becomes a crime. With the
law to support it, it is condemned without a
hearing. 1 desire, therefore, that all necessity
for Executive direction in local affairs may be
come unnecessary and obsolete. I fnvite the
attention, not of Congress, but of the people of
the United States, to the causes and effects of
these unhappy questions. Is there not a dis
position on one side to magnify wrongs and
outrages and on the other side to belittle them
or justify them f If public opinion could be
directed to a correct survey of what Is, and to
rebuking wrong and aiding the proper author
ities in punishing it, a better state of feeling
would le inculcated, and the sooner we would
have that peace which would leave the States
free indeed to regulate their own domestic af
fairs. I believe on the part of our citizens of
the Southern States the better part of them
there is a disposition to be law-abiding, and to
do co violence, either to Individuals or to the
laws existing. But do they do right in ignor
ing the existence of violence and bloodshed in
resistance to constituted authority! I sympa
thize with their prostrate condition, and would
do all in my power to relievo them acknowl
edging that In some Instances they have had
most trying governments to live under, and
very oppressive ones in the way of taxation fbr
nominal Improvements, cot giving benefits
equal to the hardships imposed but can tbey
proclaim themselves entirely irresponsible for
this condition! They cannot.
VIOLENCE HAS BEEN- ItAMrANT
in some localities, and has either been Justified
or denied by those who could have prevented
It. The theory Is even raised that there fs to
be co further Interference on the part of the
General Government to protect citizens within
a State where the State authorities fail to give
protection. This Is a great mistake. While I
remain Executive all the laws of Congress and
the provisions of the Constitution, including
the recent amendments added thereto, will be
enforced with rigor, but wfth regret that they
should have added one jot or tittle to Execu
tive duties or powers. Let there be fairness
in the discussion of Southern questions, tho
advocates of both or all political parties giv
ing honest, truthful reports of occurrences,
condemning the wrong and upholding the
right, and soon all will be well. Under ex
isting conditions the negro votes the Republi
can ticket, because he knows his friends are
of that party. Many a good citizen votes the
opposite, not because he agrees with the great
principles of State which separate parties, but
because, generally, he is opposed to negro rule.
This Is a most delusive cry. Treat the cogro
as a citizen and a voter as he is and must re
main and soon parties will be divided, not on
the color line, bnt on principle. Then wc shall
have co complaints of sectional interference.
THE REPORT Or THE ATTORNET GENERAL
contains valuable recommendations relating to
the administration of justice in the courts of
the Unit ed States, to which I Invll e your atten
tion. I respectfully suggest to Congress the
propriety of increasing the number of judicial
districts In the United States to eleven, the
present cumber being nine, and the creation of
two additional judgeships. The .territory to
be traversed by tho circuit judges is so great,
and the business of the courts so steadily in
creasing, that it ts growing more and more Im
possible lor them to keep up with the business
requiring their attention, whether this would
Involve the necessity of adding two more jus
tices of the Supreme Court to the present num
ber I submit to the judgment of Congress.
THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
The attention of Congress Is Invited to the
report of the Secretary or the Interior and to
the legislation asked for by him. The domes
tic interests of the people are more intimately
connected with this Department than with
either of the other Departments of the Govern
ment. Its duties have been added to from
time to time until they have become so oner
ous that without the most perfect system and
order it will be impossible for any Secretary of
the Interior to keep trace of all official trans
actions having his sanction and done in his
name, and for which he is held personally re
sponsible. The policy adopted for the man
agement of
Indian ArrAin?,
known as tho peace policy, has been adehred
to with most beneficial results. It Is confi
dently hoped that a few year more will relieve
our frontiers from danger of Indian depreda
tions. I commend the recommendation of the
Secretary for the extension of the homestead
laws to the Indians and for some sort of terri
torial government for the Indian Territory. A
great majority of the Indians occupying this
Territory are "believed yet to be Incapable of
maintaining tbeic rights against the more civil
ized and enlightened white tnan. Any terri
torial form of government given them, there
fore, shocld protect tbcm in tbrir homes and
property for a period of at least twenty years,
and before Its final adoption shonld be ratified
by a majority of those affected.- The report of
me secretary ot me interior, ncrewuu irsru
.mitted, gives much Interesting statistical In
formation which I abstain from giving an ab
stract of, but refer you to the report itscii.
TnE PENSIOX LAWS.
The actof Congress proridlngthe oath which
pensioners must subscribe to before drawing
their pensions cuts off from this bounty a few sur
vivors of the war of 1S12 residing in the South
ern States. I recommend the restoration of
this bounty to all such. The number of per
sons whose names would thus be restored to
the list of pensioners is not large. They are all
old persons, who could hare taken no part In
the rebellion, and the services for whfch they
were awarded pensions werer in defence of the
whole country.
THE AGRICULTURAL BUREAU.
The report of the Commissioner of Agricul
ture, herewith, contains suggestions of much
interest to the general public, and refers to
the approaching Centennial and the part his
Department Is ready to take In it. I feel that
the nation at large Is Interested in having this
exposition a success, and commend to Con
gress such action as will secure a greater gen
eral interest in it. Already many foreign
nations have signified their intention to be rep
resented at it, and it may be expected that
every civilized nation wtll be represented. The
rules adopted to improve
the crvn. SERVICE
of the Government have been adhered to as
closely as has been practicable with the oppo
sition with which they meet. The effect, I
believe, has been beneficial on the whole, and
has tended to the elevation of the service. But
it Is impracticable to maintain them without
direct and positive support of Congress. Gen
erally the support which this reform receives b
from those who give It their support only to
find fault when the rules are apparently
departed from. Removals from office without
preferring charges against parties removed
are frequently cited as departures from the
rules adopted, and the retention of those
against whom charges are made by Irresponsi
ble persons, and without good grounds, Is also
often condemned as a violation of them.
Under these circumstances, therefore. I an
nounce that ff Congress adjourns without
positive legislation on the subject of "civil
service reform" I wtll regard such action as a
disapproval of the system, and will abandon
it, except so far as to require examinations for
certain appointees to determine their fitnesj.
Competitive examinations will be abandoned.
The gectlemea who have given their services,
without compensation, as members of the
board, to devise rules and regulations for the
government of the civil service of the country,
have shown much zeal and earnestness in
their work, and to them, as well as to myself,
ft will be a source of mortification If It is to
be thrown away. But I repeat that it Is im
possible to carry this system to a successful
issue without general approval and assistance
and positive law to support it.
CnEAP TRANSPORTATION.
I have stated that three elements of pros
perity to the nation capital, labor, skilled and
unskilled, and products of the soil still re
main with us. To direct the employment of
these is a problem deserving the most serious
attention of Congress. If employment can be
given to all the labor offering itself prosperity
necessarily follows. I have expressed the
opinion, and repeal it, that the first requisite
to the accomplishment of this end is the sub
stitution of a cound currency In place of one of
a fluctuating value. This secured, there are
many Interests that might be fostered to the
great profit of both labor and capital. How to
induce capital to employ labor is the question.
The subject of cheap transportation has occu
pied the attention of Congress. Much new
light on this question will, without doubt, be
given by the committee appointed by the last
Congress to investigate and report upon this
subject.
OUR MARITIME INTERESTS.
A revival of shipbuilding, and particularly ot
iron-steamship building, Is of vast Importance
to our national prosperity. The United States
Is now paying over $100,000,000 per annum for
freights and passage on foreign ships, to be
carried and expended in the employment and
support of other peoples beyond a fair per
centage of what should go to foreign vessels,
estimating on the tonnage and travel of each
respectively. It Is to be regretted that this
disparity in the carrying trade exists, and to
correct it I would be willing to see a great de
parture from the usual course of government
in supporting what might usually be termed
private enterprise. I would not suggest as a
remedy direct subsidy to American steamship
lines, bnt I wonld suggest the direct offer of
ample compensation for carrying the malls
between Atlantic sea-board cities and the con
tinent on American-owned and American-built
steamers, and would extend this liberality to
vessels carrying the mails to South Ameri
can States and to Central America and Mexico,
and would pursue the same policy from our
Pacific seaports to foreign seaports on the
Pacific. It might be demanded that vessels
built for this service should come up to a
standard fixed by legislation In tonnage,
speed and all other qualities looking to the
possibility of Government requiring tbcm at
sometime for war purposes. The right also
of taking possession of them in such emer
gency sbonld be guarded.
I offer these suggestions, believing them
worthy of consideration In all seriousness, af
fecting all sections and all Interests alike. If
anything bcticr can be done to direct the
country Into a course of general prosperity no
one will be more ready than I to second the
plan.
TnE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Forwarded herewith will be founl the re
port of the Commissioners appointed under
an act of Congress approved June 20, 1374, to
wind up the attars of the District government.
It will be seen from the report that the net
debt of the District of Columbia, less securi
ties on hand and available, is:
Bonded debt fssued prior to July

Leaving actual debt. less said as

In addition to this there are claims preferred
against the government of the District amaunt
ii.g In the estimated aggregate reported by the
Board of Audit to $3,147,787.43, of which the
greater part will probably be rejected. This
sum can with no more propriety be incluled In
the debt account of the District government
than can the thousands of claims against the
General Government be Included as a por
tion of the national debt. But the aggregate
sum thus stated Includes something more than
the funded debt chargeable exclusively to the
District of Columbia. The act of Con-rress or
June 23, 1374, contemplates an apportionment
between the United States Government anl
the District of Columbia, in respect of the pay
ment of the principal and interest of the S-Ki
bonds. Therefore, in computing with pre
cision the bonded debt ofthe District,thc aggre
gate sums above stated as respects 3-G" bonds
cow issued, the outstanding certificates of the
Board of Audit, and the unadjusted claims
pending before that board, should be reduced
to the extent of the amount to be apportioned
to the United States Government in the man
ner Indicated in the actof Congress, of June
0, 1874.
I especially invite your attention to the re
commendations of the coramtsskraers of the
sinking fund relative to the ambiguity of the
act of June 20, 1S74, the Interest on the Dis
trict bonds and the consolidation of the indebt
edness of the District.
I feel much indebted to the gentlemen who
consented to leave their private affairs and
come from a distance to attend to the business
of this District, and for the able and satisfac
tory manner in which it has been conducted.
I am sure their serviiei will be equally appre
ciated by the entire country.
It will be seen from the accompanying full
report of the Board or Health that the sani
tary condition of the District is very satlsfac
top. THE COCNTKI AND THE CAPITAL.
In my opinion the District of Columbia
should be regarded ts the' grounds of the
National Capital, In which the entire people
are interested. I do Lot allude to this to urge
generous appropriations to the District, but to
draw the attention of Congress, in framing a
law for the government of the DUtilct, to the
magnificent scale on which the city was
planned by the focnicre of the Government;
the maonerln which for ornamental purposes
the reservations, streets and avenues were laid
out, and the proportion of tbc property actu
ally possessed by the General Government.
I thick the proporticn of the expenses of the
Government and improvements to le borne by
the General Government, the cities of Wash
ington and Georgetown and the county should
be carefully and' equitably defined.
