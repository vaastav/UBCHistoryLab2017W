Japan Strongly
Defended by Gary
Chairman of Steel Corpora
tion Denounces 'Ef forts, to
Stir Up Trouble." ;
" ,y- : :
New York, Dec. 16. Denouncing
what, he termed a "vicious and de
liberate effort to stir up trouble be
tween the people of Japan and the
United States' Elbert II. Gary,
chairman of the board of the United
States Steel corporation, declared in
an address at the annual dinner of
the.Japane.se society of 'New York
that should the two nations clash
"the people of this country will -be
more to blame than the people of
Japan."
Asserting that he liked and trusted
the honesty and integrity of the
Japanese, Mr. Gary added: "They
arc, building navies as a last resort
ofdefense against attack without
reason."
Alluding to anti-Japanese, propa
ganda in the United States-, Mr.
Gary said:
"We are apt to think that there
is a desire for trouble with Japan
and the people of Japan would be in
clined to think the same of the ut
terances of that .kind in the United
States.
"What are the Japanese doing?
Some complain that Japan,-is ac
tually increasing its navy ahd that
Japan is preparing for a war with
the United Mates.
"If that is good argument for a
warTl inauire what country that has
a sea and money enough to build
warships, isn't preparing for war
with the United States or some other
country? Isn't it fair and reason
able to judge Japan by ourselves?
, "It is the desire of the great
masses and particularly the leaders
of Japan, for a most intimate friend
ship with the United ates. The
people who desire to sffr up trouble
are not honest or fair. The largo

Newspapers in Japan
; Criticize Message
- Of President Wilson
San Francisco. Dec. 16. Criticism
oi . President Wilsou's last message
to congress by the newspapers in
Japan was madi public here today
y the Japanese consulate.
According to the Japanese consu
late advices, the Tokio Yorodzu of
December 10 commented:
"President Wilson says Americans
should espouse ttlie cause of right
mid jojiticc, but it is curious-to note
that America's attitude is becoming
increasingly contrary to this princi
ple of late. The presidential mes
sage makes no reference whatever to
the league of nations nor to Japanese
questions. It ijdeplorable, for the
sake of Americans, that theyyhoubf
more and more be led to lose sigllt
oi justice and humanity. The Japa
nese question is capable of immedi
ate solution if justice is respected."
The Tokio Nichi Nichi of Decem
ber 10 commented:! . 1 -
"President Wilson docs not. sny fi
single word regarding it (the league
of nations) in his congressional mes
sage. If he really believed, that
right makes might; Why should he
fail to urge in his message the neces
sity of joining the league and trying
to dispel the misunderstandings en
tertained by Americans and the
world generally? The present atti
tude of President Wilson is strange,
to say the least."
