Murdered by a Negro.
Wes Young, a negro, shot and killed
A. F. Middagh, a well-known Chicago
man, who is interested in a real estate
company in Vicksburg. The killing
occurred at Valley Park, in Warren
county, and was absolutely without
provocation, as Middagh had never
known the negro and had but a short
while before the murder stepped off the
train at Valley Park, where he bad
gone to hunt. Young and a number of
other negroes had been discussing race
troubles. Young, drawing his pistol,
said, “If I got in trouble with a white
man I would do this way,” and with
this remark he aimed his pistol at
Middagh and flred. Death was almost
instantaneous.

out of the way by persons who make
their headquarters in the restricted ter
ritory, there is some talk of a concert
ed movement on the part of the public
to wipe out this district.
Ethel Byrd Acquitted.

Congressman Byrd, for the killing of

parties involved and the array of legal
talent on both sides, Senator McLaurin

“M’amie have you been hear what
dey say about Bete-noire?”
“Qu’ est-ce?” demanded Madame
Lanese.
“Dey say,” Madame Spigolet’s voice
lowered, “dey say he’s been shoot de
crap.”
Madame Lanese swallowed the
shock grimly. “Seems like Bete-noire
just love to do what he ought not.”
Madame Spigolet continued. “When
my old man ask him about das, he
laugh and show him dollar. Call it
‘easy money.’ My old man say he
learn dose words down to Still. He
say all dose young woods-riders talk
like das. I wish me das still catch fire
and burn up.”
Madame Lanese was a woman of
few words and no apostrophes.
“Dame,” she said tersely. “If Bete
noire going shoot de crap like one
negah, he ain’t going come see Made
line.”
“Bete-noire,” assented Madame Spig
olet.
Eh bien, the thought of Henri al
ways did suggest his nickname. His
head was red, his skin like skimmed
milk, his eyes like bits of brown fire;
but madame, his mother, had renamed
him before he was knee high. Such
a wilfull little plague he was, forever
doing the most unexpected things—
“Bete-noire.”
And the bigger Henri grew the bet
ter the nickname suited him. A laugh
ter-loving, dare-devil, honest and gen
erous, and wild as the wind. If it was
a boat race, the boat he sailed would
win—if she did not go to the bottom.
If It was a horse race, the horse he
rode would lead by a neck —if it did
not break a leg. But. yes! betting was
always interesting when Bete-noire
was in the running. No wonder the
Bayou loved him; no wonder it shook
the sorrowful head when he fell from
grace. And after that crap-shooting,
fall from grace Bete-noire did as flat
as ever angel fell. Even M. Lanese
shook the head.
“Das ain’t right, shoot crap like
one negah. No, sir; das ain’t right,”
he said to his wife; and Madame La
nese said briefly to Madeline, her
daughter, that she would not speak
with Bete-noire any more.
Madeline made answer: “I been told
Bete-noire I make marry wit’ him
when he build house.” ’
“You can’t make marry wit’ boy das
do like one negah.”
“I’m going make marry wit’ Bete
noire when he gets house built.”
“Ha! Das what you t’ink maybe;
but me, I say non, non, non!”
Madeline said nothing.
Madame Lanese sought her friend.
“Par Madonne!” ejaculated Madame
Spigolet, when she had heard the
story. “And Madeline, she say—
yes?”
“But me, I say non, non, non!” Ma
dame Lanese felt a little proud of her
volubility. She had never done it
before.
“And what she say den?”
“Not’lng.” Madame relapsed Into
brevity. “Just go on peeling ’taters.
Dam ’taters!” she declared, rather un
fairly, for the potatoes had not been
that way at all. Madame Spigolet was
concerned with the situation:
“Mais ciel! She can’t make marry
if you say no.”
“She make her age in five years
and den —”
“Bein! Das long time, five years, if
you young. Tell Bete-noire he can’t
come see Madeline till she make her
age.”
Sait! But Bete-noire, notified that
he should not invade M. Lanese’s
front gallery, joyfully invaded M. La
nese’s cornfield, where Madeline was
pulling fodder before sun-up, and joy
fully took Madeline Into his arms.
“Don’t you bot’er, Bebe. I’m going
build house for you tout-do-suite.”
Madeline said “Yes” contentedly.
She had not a doubt but what he
would. Eh, bein! It Is so comforting
to feel that one’s lover is the biggest
and bravest man on the Bayou.
Under pressure of her faith'ln“hiin,
Bete-noire resolved to do what no
other boy on the Bayou had ever
done —go away from home to make
his fortune. Ten miles from the Ba
you, he learned, there was a factory
that paid three dollars and twenty
cents a barrel for shrimp; and that
ten barrels was a not unusual day’s
catch. More money in that than In
dipping turpentine for 30 cents a bar
rel, or burning coal for S4O a kiln. Ha!
he would go to work for the factory.
When Bete-noire ran his boat along
side the factory wharf they told him
he must go to the notary and get a
license, and he went, wondering reck
lessly what license might be. But
when he saw the bit of paper and un
derstood that he would have to pay
some money for it, he perceived that
it was much like the “tifitate” old
man Rene showed whenever he want
ed to get out of working the roads.
Ha! a certificate is no bad thing to
have! Bete-noire put It In hla pocket
and sailed away. His dago assistant
sat down in the bow and said noth
ing. What could he say, unless he
meant to lose his day s work, or,
rather, day’s pay for Idleness?
Blithely unconscious of the evil sig
nificance that hung over the empty
scene, Bete-noire set his man and
himself to work. Shrimp were plen
tiful, yet, save a sail in the offing, no
other boat was In sight. The dago
watched the sail, Bete-noire did not.
He had come there to catch shrimp,
and he was catching them when a
boat swooped alongside and a gentle
man, uninvited, came aboard.
“Seem to be catching some shrimp,
said this gentleman, dryly.
“Yes, sir,” returned Bete-noire po
litely, “I been catch some, me!”
“Well, you are going to stop It, you
know?”
“Ha?” questioned Bete-noire pleas
antly.
“You, nor no other man ain’t going
to fish shrimp out of these here waters
for three, twenty a barrel.”
“Yes, sir,” said Bete-noire, “das
what I get, me. T’ree, twenty a barrel.”
“Well, you shan’t, do you under
stand?”
Bete-noire bethought him of his cer
tificate and drew it out.
“Ain’t dat ’tifitate all right?” he de
manded.
“That paper’s got nothing to do with
it. You got to throw them shrimp
back in the water and go home.”
“Ha?” said Bete-noire. The dago
began to grin but the delegate didn’t
understand the tone. He swore sharp
ly.
“I’ll show you what I mean, thick
head.” and seizing a shovel he threw a
peck of shrimp overboard. The next
instant he dropped the shovel and
dove head-first after those shrimp.
As his boat-man pulled the delegate
in a voice low-pitched and vibrant put
the question: “You going get out; you
going die?” and the steady aim of the
rifle put a point to the question.
The boat-man dropped to his oars.
It was sometime before he even took
breath to say disgustedly over his
shoulder: “Didn’t you know no better
than to make a ’Cajan mad?”
By and by other boats came out on
the bay; some hailed him cheerily,
some went, sullen, by. Bete-noire did
not notice. He was busy and so was
the Dago now. And when he got in
with his load everybody seemed busy
with hkn. He shook his hand, they
bragged about his catch, they helped
him unload, they showed him where to
get his checks. And when the man at
the window had pushed out the checks,
he too, shook hands with Bete-noire
and said genially: “The boss wants
to see you.”
“Where I find him. If you please?”
“In yonder.”
As Bete-noire entered the office, the
bookkeeper said significantly: “Here’s
that read-headed ’Cajan.”
The boss dropped his paper and
arose: “Ah, Mr. Bete-noire they tell
me you made a fine catch.”
“Yes, sir; t’ank you. I do pretty
good, me,” and Bete-noire, smiling,
shook hands for the twentieth time.
“I understand —ah —that you had
some trouble out there.”
“Trouble?” No, sir; I didn’t have no
trouble. No trouble ’tall. Water still,
plainty shrimp—ten barrels. Every
t’ing all right.”
The boss bit his beard. “Ah? I un
derstand that someone tried to throw
your shrimp overboard.”
Bete-noire’s fine teeth flashed with
fun: “Yes, sir; das what he say. But,
me, I t’row damfool overboard.”
A roar of laughter rang through the
factory and Bete-noire joined joyously
in the joy of it. It was worth even a
peck of shrimp.
“Well,” he said courteously, “I reck
on, me, I better be going.”
A heavy hand clapped his shoulder.
“Yes, sir! You better be going wit'
me. I got wagon here for you.” It
was M. Lanese. He had come to town
to trade hides for cot’-meal and had
been greeted on all sides with how
Bete-noire had “broke strike.” Mon
sieur never stopped to question wheth
er it was a good thing or no to break
a strike. He just let himself go with
gladness and said td everybody that
would listen: “Yes, sir; das great
chap, das Bete-noire. Great chap,
sho! He’s going make marry wit’ my
ill* gal. And I reckon, me, he break*
strike all right. He’s always break*
somet’ing.”
And the craps? Eh, bien! When a
man makes a fine catch shall not his
sins be forgiven him?
