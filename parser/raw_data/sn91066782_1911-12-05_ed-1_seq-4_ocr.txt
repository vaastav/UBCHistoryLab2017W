Vte haven't heard of Rockefeller giv
ing his oil stock to feed the poor.
The snow will be' welcomed, if for
nothing more than to lay the dust.
They might as well try to separate
fish from water as to disassociate John
D. Rockefeller from Standard Oil.
Congress opened with fireworks of the
Littleton brand. However, it is urgently
hoped that the supply was exhausted at
the first exhibition.
That saving of ?21,283,!)21.43 in the
federal expenses for the next fiscal year
came too late for Thanksgiving, but it
will be just as welcome.
When Vermont framed a law in 1908
to prevent "white slave" traffic, the law
was thought by many to be needless.
Still it was necessary so that it would
not have to be used.
President Taft will run his message
in serial form, taking up a single mat
ter in each. However, we do not antici
pate the arrangement will abate the
interest in them. As a matter of fact,
such an arrangement is far more prac
tical than the crowding of a great mass
of material on many subjects into ij
ingle message. No president could hope
that the public would be able to give
careful attention to a message which
contains every subject that pertains to
the presidential ollice, no matter how in
terestingly the president might be able
to write. Therefore, by confining his
attention to a single subject in a single
message, and not making it too long,
President Taft should find himself talk
ing to a greater number of people than
is customary. The trust message, which
is printed verbatim in to-day's paper,
is perhaps longer than the average per
son wishes, but owing to the nature ot
the discussion it demands rather more
attention than almost any other subject
now before the people. It is to be ex
pected that messages on bther less im
portant matters will be scaled down in
length to compare.
STRETCHING A TOINT.
On what ground does the Ludlow
Tribune justify its statement that Jo
seph A. LVBopr of Montpelier "was drawn
into' a gubernatorial candidacy in the
face of definite protest previously filed
by him"T Mr. LVBoer has never pro
tested against being called to the gov
ernorship of Vermont. Nor has he pro
tested against being selected as a can
didate for the nomination. The extent
of his protest, if we read the English
language correctly, was to the effect tl
he would not enter the list of Repub
lican candidates in an unseemly scramble
for the nomination. The protest previ
ously filed by him was against the meth
ods hitherto existing in Vermont, nol
against being made a candidate.
Therefore, the contemporary does the
Montpelier man injustice in asserting
that he was dragged into becoming
candidate against his will and against
his desires, as The Tribune does in the
following paragraph from last week's
issue:
"The drafting process indulged in at
Montpelier the other night, by means of
which an estimable resident of that city
was drawn into a gubernatorial candi
dacy in the face of definite protest pre
viously filed by him, appears not to have
generated a great amount of enthusiasm,
even in the territory within which the
boom was launched."
As to the other part of the insinua
tion, regarding the alleged lack of in
terest in his entry into the contest, that
is largely a matter of opinon. Certain
it was, however, that several hundred
persons turned out at a time so early
in the canvass that enthusiasm is neve.'
looked for, that those several hundred
people received Mr. DeBoer's statments
with thonghtful concern and that Mr.
DeBcor' Temarka made deep impression.
True, is was not the "rah rah" enthusi
asm ; it was something deeper.

On that statement. Alderman Thurston
moved the reconsideration of the former
nnnronria tion u-hii-h u-hm nrri.Ml ami
then moved the appropriation of f,"0,
wnicn was likewise treated. Nj the. two
associations fare alike.
Destitution Cause of Truancy.
Some caftes of destitution so bad that
it was reported children couldn't go to
school because they hadrtt shoes and
clothing were reported by Dr, Joe V.
Jackson. He stated that five children
were out of school because thpy hadn't
the clothing to wear, two being in a fam
ily in which either the eighth or ninth
child had recently been born another iu
a widow's family of either six or seven
children (he eouldn't say accurately),
still another being in a family where
the mother had just died. A like situa
tion in which two girls were left alone
while their mother was in jail was re
ported. To all of these Alderman McLeod of
the charity committee asserted that no
report had come to the committee, that
if report had come the city would have
rendered the assistance merited. In at
least one of the cases mentioned, he
reported, the committee had clothed the
children at the opening of the school
year, so that they could attend school.
It was also asserted that sometimes chil
dren or their parents make the alleged
lack of suitable clothing an excuse for
not having the children in school, but
not necessarily in the cases referred
to. The! charity committee was instruct
ed to look into the cases.
A second complaint by Dr. Jackson, to
the effect thnt' the city dump is "rot
ten," "filthy," and otherwise obxonious,
was referred to the health committee,
with instructions to see that such con
ditions be not allowed to continue.
Mayor Mutch stated that the street com
mittee had cleaned up the place Borne
time ago and that the understanding
then was that the health committee
should keep it clean.
City Sells Land.
A warranty deed from the city to
Brown, Carroll &, Co. for the sale of land
off Depot square for a granite plant was
read, and Mayor Mutch was authorized
by resolution to execute the deed after
some slight changes had been made.
The deed conveys eight-tenths of an acre
for $2,000, the land running from the
new Tiver bed to land of the Central
Vermont railroad.
City Engineer Reed's report on bridges
showed that the Berlin and South Main
street structures had been replanked,
that the Blackwell street bridge should
be replanked next spring, that one string
er had fallen off the Berlin street bridge,
that only two of the seven props on the
South Main street bridge were in work
ing order, and that Blight work should
be done about the Prospect street and
Granite street bridges. The report was
accepted, and the recommendations were
ordered carried out.
Select Site for Horse Fountain.
Selection of a site at the corner of
South Main and Hill streets for the
horse fountain which was removed from
the city square to permit of the placing
of the granite fountain, given by the
National Humane Alliance asite which
had been chosen by the water and street
committees was approved. Alderman
Willey stated that one condition of the
gift of the granite fountain was that
the old fountain be placed in some other
part of the city. It was suggested that
a light over each of the fountains is n
necessity. The lighting committee prom
ised to look after the matter, Alderman
Rossi saying that the granite fountain
is alreaiiy wired for an electric light.
The same committee reported in favor
of placing an incandescent light on up
per Granite street and one on Willey
street, and the report was accepted. The
fire committee reported against chang
ing the hydrant at the corner of North
Main and North Seminary streets,which
Mr. Kingston claimed was on his land,
until such time as the street line w
established. This renort was also ac
cepted. The council adjourned at 8:13 1
to take up committee work.

La Follette Criticises Taft'a Tariff Board
Senator I.a Follette, writing his auto
biography in the December American
Magaiue, refers to what ho calls, "the
prewnt so-called turiff board appointed
ty Mr. Taft," and goes on to Bay:
"While the present tariff board may
gather much valuable information, it
has no power of commanding the facts
from unwilling manufacturers; it doe
rot meet the requirement that every
member shall be specially trained for the
service, it is insultiduntfy supplied with
funds, and it reports to the executive
rather than the legislative branch, of the
government. Its lack of power was
well expressed by its capable chairman,
Prof. Henry C. fernery, in a speech to
the American Association of Woolen and
Worsted Manufacturers on DecemlxT 8,
1010. He said:
" 'You must not think I om joking
about this thing, but there is a joke
about it, and the joke is this: I have
no powers whatsoever. Ine tariii iioaru
has no powers. There is really no such
tiling as a tarilf board. Tht law says
that for certain purposes the president
may "employ such persons" as he sees
tit. 1 am one of "such persons," nmi
is all.'
"The tariff commission should be at
the service of the homes of Congress
instead of the semi-confidential advisers
of tlw president. For it is Congress
which is charged with the duty ot iram
itig the tariir laws, and there are other
things besides mere statistics that Con
gress must pas upon. Congress must
determine whether a given Industry shall
lie protected at all. Then, before Con
gress decides that a given industry shall
be protected, we want to know how
much of its claim for protection is due
to its own iuelliciency.
