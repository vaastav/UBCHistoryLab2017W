WEEKLY ARIZONA MINER4- ERESCOTT, DECEMBER 14, 1872.
JPrescott, A.xixoiia.
THE DIAMOND SWINDLE.
What we fKnow About it in Prescott.
Everyone who has read the papers for a
!ew months past, knows that an excitement
has been raging on the Pacific Slope about an
alleged discovery of diamonds somewhere
west of the Mississippi river in some unde
fined locality, either in southeastern Utah,
southwestern Colorado, or northeastern Ari
zona, and the floating population of miners,
prospectors, speculators, and sharps, has been
jnuch exercised in mind on the subject, all
agreeing that diamonds were worth looking
after, and only doubtful as to the proper, lo
cality to commence the search in.
The muss did not originate in any settled
portion of Arizona, nor have either of the
three papers publislicu m tne, lermory uiueu ;
... I
or aueltcu me so-caueu swiuuiuauu uuuiuug.
The Mi n mi, Citizen and Sentinel have each
and all most persistently and consistently re
frained from giving countenance to the state
ments made in regard to diamond fields said
to be located in Arizona.
Months passed away and the Minbii re
peatedly dcclared.that no diamonds had been
brought to Prescott from the new diamond
fields. Wc were distrustful and incredulous;
but at last the disease known as "diamonds
on the brain" broke out in Prescott, and a
party of six started from Prescott on the 5th
.of September to hunt for the. precious gems.
Four of the party returned to town on Fri
day evening, December Gth, having been
gone about three months. The party con
sisted of Me.srs. Hutchinson, Dicknson,
Tompkins, Ilagan, Herring aud Tremble; the
last named left the party and struck out for
Salt Lake City. Herring was outfitted by
the others and stopped on the "fields," pre
' pared to stay and fight it out on that line all
winter. The other four arc here . among us,
having lots of rocks, red, white, and green,
supposed to bo rubies, opals, -aqua-marines,
and emeralds, with lots of garnets, quartz
crystals, petrifactions and other pretty but
comparatively worthless stones, and with a
few which they hope are diamonds.
The "boys" tell a story of long wanderings
up and down, hit her and yon,-to and fro' in
the unexplored regions north, northeast and
northwest from Fort Defiance ; the' followed
Mike Gray's trail in all its twistings and turn
ings for 500 or GOO miles ; they penetrated
the country belonging-lo the Ute Indians, and
being politely requested by the authorities of
that high-toned nation, backed .by 300 well
armed, able-bodied warriors, to get outside
of their grounds, prudently skeda'ddlcd, and
finally found the camp of Slack and Arnold,
(the original locators on the diamoud fields),
their notices claiming the valuable ground,
and their monuments defining .their bounda-
. . . 1 Ti 1 r it, ... . 1 1... 1 . . . , - 1
ries.
In that neighborhood tlic Prescott "boys;"
struck it ; their claims are located' in that
vicinity. Sam. Uall, Fox, Cunningham, Moss
and Atchison arc located in close connection.
There C. P. Stanton found tho. stone which
at latest accounts from San Fiancisco was
poohed at by some experts as s, soft garnet of
littlo value, and valued by others as a ruby
worth thousands of dollars. This section of
country is about 120 miles northwest from
Fort Defiance, and not within 300 miles of
tho location claimed by Harpciiding, Lent,
Huberts & Co., of San Francisco.
"Tho way tho old thing works" is very
funny: As stated above, on tho Gth of De
cember, tho Prescott party returned jubilant.
confident, enthusiastic, having left one of
their number on their claims to hold them
until the return of the party with the neces
sary ontfit for permanent work, having
found a country rich enough to pay in rubies,
opals, amethysts, sapphires and other precious
stones, even if there arc no diamonds, and
creating quite a sensation among the old pio
neers of Arizona resident in Prescott, which
grew with what it fed on until Tuesday, the
'10th iust., whon tho San Francisco Alia, Call,
Bulletin and Chronicle, of Nov. 30th, arrived
by mail, giving the expose made by Clarence
King, U. S. Geologist ; Gen. Colton, manager
of the San Francisco and New York Mining
And Commercial Company, and Henry Janin,
mining expert for the same party.
Hundreds of excited individuals have pe
rused the columns of those papers, and h'ave
interviewed Messrs. Dickason, Ball, .Hutchin
son Tompkins and Ilagan, comparing their
statements witli the reports of the exposers;
and as n natural consequence therchas been
more talk aV"ut diamonds and precious gems
generally, " Preset this 'veok, than ever
before, and more Iwlioveis in the existence of
valuable stones in the northeastern corner of

Moreover, the gentlemen who are co-opera t-
'
nig in that exploration-nave not put siock on ,
the market, which takes away all object for
deception.. Neither are they deceived by
others, as Messrs. Roberts and Harpending
appear, to have been; "What, theii,rarc we to.
think about the deception in the case of
those gentlemen 3, -Did the "salting'.'-cpmc
vuwr'
fnjm j omfon?
We tnniK not; oecause tne
stones composing the "salting" are exactly
like the IHO pounds of "stones now at Sher
wood's bank. Therefore it-seems probable-'
that those found in Colorado came from the
same locality. ' In" corroboration, the persons
who sold the Colorado, claim to Messrs.
Roberts & Co. are known to have been at
Fort Defiance f arid; before the expose the Pa
cific Company was inforniod that those per
sons got a bag.- uf-staues from tire present
grounds of tho Pacilib Compady. If there
was "salting" it came; in all probability, from
that locality. . . - -
Rubies, emeralds, etc., are alike abundant
in the 150 pounds arid in' the lot 'that came
from Colorado, and diamonds arc. equally
small and few in both lots.
The location in Colora'dd "is described as
not in the.itaqoluniite.rockv But ther Pacific
Company's locality is in itacolumite that
laminated, elastic and reddish yellow sand
atone that is the homo of the diamonds and
other precious atones. Probably,, where
diamonds most abound, other varieties of
stones are not so- plenty. ,v The diamond
range is 150 miles long at the least, and that
diamonds have- been found, however small
and few, is foundation for reasonable belief
that larger ones, nr greater supply, will be
found in placers, on further exploration. "We
hold that" recent developments, 400 miles
away in Northern Colorado, should not be
accepted as any criterion that - there is nc-t a
diamond field in New Mexico and Arizona.
Nor isit to bo assumed that on this great
Continent, rich in all the precious metals, it
is not likely that w;o have diamonds. '"Tlic
I probabilities are all the other way. Letl
cverv tlnnkintr lhan ask himself tueoucsuonH
"Why should we not have diamonds in this
glorious land so blessed of Heaven in all kin

' A letter from our correspondent af Camp
Bcale Sniiii'rs. sives a vcrv lively and encour
aging account of mining matters in Cerbat,,
Mineral I'ark and Clilondc, all included in
what is generally known as WiH.pii district,
Mohave county. .'
The1 letter confirms our advices of last
week concerning the. strike: ntthc water line'
of rich ore on the Fairfield mine in Mineral
Park, and states that on November 27th a
rich body of ore, assaying $800.00 per ton,
with n width of three feet, was struck in the
Lone Star shaft, causing a rise of $10 per
sharo in the stqck.of the company (the Lone
Star is incorporated) in one day.
Our correspondent also states that the
Gunsight mine, south of Wallapai district,
is turning out ore of the richest quality, and
that a new vein of large size, showing excel
lent ore on the surface, has just been found,
two miles from the Gunsight, by a French
man named Magendie, which was causing
some excitement among the miners.
Major Whcelerxt Co. were busily sinking
on mines in Mavnard district, thirty miles
southeast from Wallapai district, near Wal

pects. Tho saw-mill in Mayuard district, owned
by gentlemen iu Cerbat, is making .lumber of

MINES AND MININ&.
Mr. P. TV. Smith from Wickenburg visited
Prescott last week and stated that his efforts
. 4. TT
to obtain water by sinking wells on the Has
. -
sa3'ampa, 12 to lo miles below Wickenburg
Jit b
f
sunk five or six wells from 50 to ISO feet in
depth, iu hopes of obtaining a supply of wa-
ter at a desirable point, and has now aband
oned the project, and proposes to lay a flume
under ground from the mouth of the canon
of the Hassayampa to the point where he is
erecting his quartz-mill.' The Hume or box
will be 0 inches square and nearly 5 miles
long. .His object is to place his mill where
his supply of water will be unfailing, where
, , .
wood is plenty and the distance to haul

hmokIt will lio tiiro rmlos l5 rlinn nr. tlip old
quartz will be five miles less than at the old
location of the mill at Wickenburg.
Mr.S. has his claims on the Vulture opened,
sufficiently to insure a supply of quartz of
good quality, and will push his operations
ahead without dclav.
The Vulture Company.
This company have not 'et resumed work,
and a degree of secrecy attend their move
ments. Humors are afloat that a large amount
of money has been or will be placed at the
disposal of the company which -will enable
them to settle their liabilities and make somo
long contemplated improvements. A good
judge of such things. assures us that the tail
ings heaped up around the Vulture mill, are
worth nearly 300,000. . . .
, , Bradshaw -Mines.
. All operations on the Tigerand other mines,
on the southern slope of Bradshaw moun
tains, are for the present, suspended. A. few
men will winter there but with the exception
of such labor as is required under the law tp
hold claims, little work will be done this
winter. -
Sale of Mining Property.
During tho week past, A. B. Smith has
disposed of his entire interest in the Del Pas
co mill and mine, and in the War Eaglc.and
other mines, to Captain Irving, who wj.ll
take hold encrgctically 'wTtli Jackson & Co.
to work on and develope their valuable prop
erty. Nothing is needed but water sufficient,
to run the mill "to" enable them to make
money. The reputation of the War Eagle
is nearly equal to the Tiger for richness.
Placer Mines.
Although the placer miners on the creok?
near Prescott are constantly taking out some
cold, they are getting uneasy and anxious
for rain or snow. It is now the middle, of
December, andiio wet weather has come yet.

Indians. They state that they found the
country on the upper Verde frightfully rough
even worse than the Santa Maria country.
Plenty of Indian sign was found but no Ind

INDIAN NEWS.
Gen. O. O. Howard's Report; Etc.
The Washington Chronicle of 2sov. 10, con
tains six columns detailing the gleanings
tnadeln its reporter from Gen. O. O. How-
nrdj Indian Peace Commissioner, on his re
turn to Washington, after his late trip
through New Mexico and Arizona. We
went through the whole story, as in duty
bound', and can only say that the portion of
it that is interesting to Arizonans may be
summed up in a very few words. Gen. How
ard came from Washington to Santa Fe, and
thence to Fort Wingate, and there held a
council with Navajo and Apache chiefs, and
organized a peace between the .two tribes
which is probably not particularly interest
ing or advantageous to Arizonans. Thence
he journeyed to Camp Apache and inspected
the reservation and gave audience to the In
dians, listened to their complaints and did
all in his power to alleviate their sufferings.
From Camp Apache to the Jleservation at
Tularosa, and thence to the Canada Allamosa
the General and part' proceeded, interview-
ing the red men " of those feeding-grounds,
and then passed over the Chiricahua moun
tains, to Dragoon mountains, where he met
Cachise at his home, and seems to have been
deeply impressed by that " noble " savage's
account 6f tho wrongs inflicted upon him
self and-tribe by white men. From that
point Cachise accompanied the General to
.Dragoon Springs, where a grand council was
tield the military officers from Camp Bowie,
on one side, Cachise and his men on thaother,
and Gen. Howard acting as mediator and
pacificator. The council lasted four hours.
Peace was established, and the Indians were
promised an agency to be located at Sulphur
Springs, to supply Cachise and his band with
rations, clothing and other fancied necessa
ries or luxuries.
After the council Gen. Howard went, via
Tucson, to Arizona- City, and thence overland
to San Francisco and Washington.
More About Cachise.
The Arizona- Citizen of November 30, and
private letters from Tucson, give accounts of
Avisit made by-Gov. Saflbrd to Cachise, from-
'
which it seems the Governor is inclined to
believe that-the olU rascal is alarmed at the
decrease of his forces and really desires peace.
Distrust is expressed by others that Cachise
may not continue in that same frame of mind
w.hen tho warm, spring sun stirs up his-recol-lecti.ons
of past pleasant spring raids on set
tlers. Murder of Cadette. .
; The Borderer of November 23d, narrates
the fact that.Cadot.tc, chief of the Muscalero
tAjiachcs, had .been found with his interpreter
murdered at La Luz, near Fort Stanton, New
iMexico.
Cadette had professed friendship and sh'own1
atileslre for peace for.;somc tune past, and the
Borderer declares that tho murder is likely to
havefc bad effect on the mind of Cachise, if
it.provc to be', tlie fact that Cadette was killed
.white men or Mexicans as the Indians
claim. It seems probable that the murder
was committed by- San tan ta, Cadette's son-in-law,
with whoniOad'ette had previously had
some trouble. Cadette's band, numbering
300 warriors had assumed a hostile attitude,
and great alarm existed among the settlers
in th'e neighborhood of Fort Stanton. The
killifig of an influential peacefully inclined
chief like Cadette, is an event to be de
plored at a critical moment like the present,
and w.e agree with the Borderer in hoping
that the murderers will be detected and pun
ished as their crime deserves.
Indian Superintendent Removed.
Col. Pope, Superintendent of Indian Af
fairs jn New Mexico, has been removed and
Levi E. Dudley aypointed in his place.
. Owing to the fact that Col. Pope sympa
thised and worked with Vincent Colyer, a
strong prejudice has existed against him in
Arizona. New Mexican papers claim that he
was energetic, prompt and conscientious in
all his dealings between settlers and Indians,
-and that his removal is to be regretted, more
especially as it is considered chargablo to
petty personal spite and religious bigotry.
Dr. II. Bendcll Superintendent of Indian
Affairs, recently returned from a long trip,
through the Territory, and states that while
on the road to Arizona City, near Gila Bond,
lin company with Gov. McCormick,. they saw
hostile Indians on the hills, saw the trail of
the Indians and the 40 mules they had stolen
from Teamsters' Camp the night previous,
(mention of which raid was made in the
Minkk of November 30th) ; saw in the dis
tant hills the cloud of dust made by the ani--tnals
the Indians .were driving away, and
found in the road a stray mule, all sweaty
and badly scared, that had probably escaped
from the Indians where they left the road.
The mule was afterward recognized by the
owner.
Superintendent Bendcll believes that the
Indians were from Camp Grant Jleservation,
from the direction they were going vith the
mules, and the fact that the agent at Grant
had reported the absence without leave of a
party of reservation Apaches.

"We call attention to the letter of Almarin
B. Paul, of San Francisco published on tho
first page of to-day's Miner, which, owing
to a aiistake, lacks Mr. Paul's signature.

D eath of Horace Greeley. -
The late candidate for the Presidency is
dead. To us, the news of his sudden decease
comes without any previous intimation of his
dangerous sickness to break the shock. The
mail, which on Tuesday morning, brought
San Francisco papers stating that Mr. Greeley
was sick with brain fever, also brought San
Diego and Los Augeles papers with telegraph
ic news of his death.
Few men have lived in the United States
who have yielded a greater influence in
journalism than Horace Greeley has for thirty
vinr 11:1st.- After the New York Tribune had
been published five years, Mr. Greeley was
r 1 ....... r. .inlifi,tnlM 1111 hlJ ivilirwll I
was successful in the main, until the present
year. Now, that the great journalist has
passed away, those who opposed him most
bitterly, during his long and busy life, will
join with his friends in placing on record the
"history of his untiring endeavors for the ad
vancement of the best interests of the great
masses of tho American people.
From the Los Angeles JVetrs wc take the
following, concerning his life :
" Mr. Greeley was bom at Amherst, New
Hampshire, on the third of February, 1811,
anil was the son of a poor farmer, who, in
1S21, removed to West Haven, Vermont.
In 1826, he made his entry into that busi
ness in which he has attained such a promi
nent position, as an apprentice to the print
ing business in the otlice of the Northern
Spectator at East Poulteney, Vermont.
His settlement iu New York dates from
August, 1831; and he arrived in that city
with only ten dollars in his pocket. After
working for fourteen months as a journey
man printer, in January, 183, he became a
partner of Frances Storey, and published
the burning Post, the first 'penny uewspaper
ever published. The Morning Post was dis
continued altera few weeks, and, in 1834, the
firm of Greeley & Co. founded the Ntic
Yorker, a weekly journal, neutral iu politics,
for which Mr. Greeley wrote the editorial
articles. From March, 1S38 to March 1839,
he edited the Jeffenonian, published under
the direction of the Whig Central Commit
tee of tho State of New York. The Log
Cabin was commenced in 1S-10, and attained
a circulation of 80,000. In 1841, he again
ventured on another one cent paper,
the New York Tribune, which increased in
6ize and price, and is now recognized as one
of the leading journals in the country, and
with which Mr. Greeley has been associated.
He supported the Presidertial campaign of
1852, Genoral Scott; in 1850, General Fre
mont; and in 18G0, Abraham Lincoln. Du
ring the war, he gave proof of his Union
principles, by his ndvocacv for thorn in the
Tribune-, and in Ma', 1867, he performed the
act which made, him po pular in the South
signing the bail bond of Jellerson Davis. .Mr.
Greeley served in Congress for a short term
1848 to 1849 as a representative from
Now York, where he principally ligured in
the discussion on the mileage system. Mr.
LGreeley visited California in 1859. traveling
by way of Ivansas, I'ike's Peak and Utah, lie
received a warm and hearty reception m ban
Francisco, and at the other cities in the State.
As nn author, Mr. Greeley attained great
popularity.
"Daring the late struggle for President ho
was selected by two conventions to contest
for it against General Grant .A more remark
able combination of political elements as hap
pened when he was nominated, does not occur
in the history of the American nation. The
history o( the campaign is familiar to every
newspaper reader. So disastrous and over
whelming a defeat as was sull'ered by Mr.
Greeley, never before fell to the lot of any
candidate seeking the Chief Magistracy of
the nation. His death is believed to be has
tened, if not actually caused, by the non
realization of the hopes he had so fondly
cherished."
Tho following are some of the despatches
that were received by California papers, dur
ing Mr Greeley's illness :
San Fiuncisco, Nov. 28 Evening.
The following painfully interesting particu
lars regarding Horace Greeley's condition
have this moment been received ;
New Yokk, Nov 28. It is now known
that Mr. Greeley is in Tarry town. A repor
ter who has just returned, says that around
h:m were a number of intimate friends, inclu
ding Samuel Sinclair and John F. Cleveland,
Mr. Greeley's brother-in-law ; also his daugh
ters. Three physicians were there in consul
tation. They defined his disease as an organ
ic affection of the brain, the result of physi
cal prostration consequent upon his unremitt
ing attendance at the bedside of his dying
wife.
This account adds that on the day before
yesterday he lost hia conciousness. His last
coherent words were: "The country is gone,
tho Tribune is gone, and I am gone." The
form of mental alienation manifested by him
is said to bo self reproach and agony of mind
at what be deemed the great mistake of his
Presidential candidature.
Mr. Greeley's friends say that his great
physical system was prostrated by the super
human strains incident to his wife's death,
and the labors of the campaign.
New York, Nsv. 30. Horace Greeley
died last evening at ten minutes before seven
o'clock. He passed away very quietly, and
his, last moments were free from pain,
lie was conscious and rational up to within
an hour of his death.
Mr. Greeley was at the residence of Mr.
Choate, three miles from Chappaqua. At
about half past three o'clock, in the afternoon
ho said distinctly, " It is done." Beyond
tho briefest answers to questions, it wa3 his
last utterance. The members of the Chappa
qua household were present, with Mr. and
Mrs. John K. Stuart and a few other friends,
nothing that science or affection could sug
gest, was wanting to ease his last moments.
The wintry night had fairly set in when
the inevitable hour came. The daughter and
a few others stood near the dying man, who
remained conscious and seemingly rational,
and free from pain, though now too week to
speak. In an adjoining room, sat one or two
friends and the physicians.
At ten minutes before seven, all drew back
in reverent stillness from the bedside. The
