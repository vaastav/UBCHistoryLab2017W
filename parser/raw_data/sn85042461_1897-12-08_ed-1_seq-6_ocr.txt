A DIVIDED PARTY
It is a significant fact in connection
with President McKinley's message,
that it has not the hearty, unanimous
approval of the party leaders. Almost
every Republican senator and represent
ative would, doubtk-ss, if pressed for a
perfunctory opinion on the message, ap
prove it as in political duty bound; but
it is nevertheless a fact that the Re
publicans, ln congress as well as out of
It, are not in thorough accord with the
president upon the vital issues before the
country. 'Whether party discipline will
whip them Into line, when the issues are
presented for decision, remains to be
seen.
The Republican senators and repre
sentatives are by no means a unit upon
the very important subject of currency
reform. Those who have not made a
study of the subject will of course en
dorse any party measure that may be
presented. There are quite a number,
however, who have decidedly diverse
views upon the question, together with
well formulated plans, which are cer
tain to be aired before they are aban
doned.
Then, too, there is no small number
of congressmen who are in favor of let
ting the currency question rest for the
present, from the fear that agitation and
discussion will exercise a disturbing ef
fect upon the business interests of the
country. It will be recalled that the
senate, during the closing hours of the
extra session of congress last summer,
administered a very decided snub to the
recommendation of the president that a
currency commission be established.
The Republicans In congress are not a
unit upon the subject of Hawaiian an
nexation. The crack of the party whip
will be heard here, for annexation has
become an administration measure, al
though the party platform is not ex
plicit upon this point.
It may be safely assumed that there
are many Republicans in congress who
do not subscribe to the policy laid down
by the president with respect to Cuba.
That part of the message Is cold-blooded
and calculating; Its expressions of sym
pathy with the Cubans are polite and
perfunctory. There are many Repub
licans who would have been glad to see
stronger and more substantial expres
sions In behalf of th.' struggling Cubans,
and whu will give publicity to their own
views regardless of the diplomatic atti
tude taken by the executive.
It will be seen thut the president is not
in thorough accord v Ith his party upon
the three most important issues before
the country at the present time. Why |
is this the situation? Why is there not I
more harmony in the dominant partyl
upon the leading questions of the day?
There are several reasons. Perhaps
the most important Is that all the Re
publicans may not agree with and up
hold the central thought that apparent
ly dominated the president In the prep
aratlon of his message. That central
thought was a complete submission to
the demand of the money power that
the gold standard be still more
firmly established as tlt - founda
tion of our currency system :
with the secondary, but hardly less
prominent consideration, that nothing
must be done to disturb business. The
president Is apparently of the opinion
that currency reform to a certain degree
may be accomplished without any
menace to business and he Is willing to
risk the effort.
The secondary consideration is by no
means to be held as unworthy. It Is the
extent to which It Is carried that should
govern the applause or the disapproval
of the people. The message conveys the
Impression that the government at
Washington, outside of currency re
form, would submit to a great deal,
would go dangerously near the verge of
Ignominy, if not of dishonor, before It
would do anything to disturb the plans
of the capitalists ln the money centers
of the country. It is the same influence
that held the United States back before
the war of 1S12; it is the same Influence
that has caused the attitude of Great
Britain to be so severely criticised with
reference to the Armenian massacres
and the Eastern question generally. It
is the same Influence that dictates the
policies of the mightiest nations of Eu
rope today—the influence of the Money
power.
In this country the dnnger from this
source lies not so much In the present as
in the possibilities of the future.
| It is the division of opinion regarding
I the reform of the currency question that
has produced the very general impres
sion that nothing will be done during
the present session of congress. Tho
friends of silver are in the minority but
they are united. They will see to it that
the shackles of the single gold standard
are not fastened more firmly upon the
American people without a severe strug
gle.
SECRETARY GAGE'S REPORT
j The annual report of Secretary of
; the Treasury Gage, which Is printed
elsewhere in this morning's Herald, first
presents the financial statistics for the
' fiscal year ending June 30, 1597. The
total receipts of the government were
t J430.357.167.59, and the total expenditures
$448,439,622.30, showing a deficiency for
theyearof $15,052,454.41. As compared with
! the fiscal year 1596, the receipts for 1597
increased $20,911,759.11, while the ordin
ary expenditures Increased $13,594,
--|713.49.
The secretary then reviews the evils
of our present currency system and says
that his recommendations should be re-
garded as tentative steps that will lead
to desirable conditions, rather than final
measures. First, he recommends legis-
lation that will establish, separate and
apart from the operations of the treas
. ury as they relate to revenue and ex
penditures, a department to be known
las the Issue and Redemption division.
To this division should be set over $125,
--000.000 In gold from the general fund in
the treasury, to be used only for redemp
tion purposes; all the silver dollars now
held for redemption of silver certificates,
and all the silver bullion and dollars
coined therefrom under the act of ISSO
to be passed to the same account.
Further, the sum of $200,000,000 in green
backs is to be collected and deposited
in the Issue and Redemption division, to
be disbursed therefrom only upon the re
ceipt of an equivalent amount of gold
coin.
Second, the secretary recommends that
provision be made for the issue of re
funding loan bonds, payable after ten
years at the pleasure of the govern
ment, to bear interest at the rate of 2Vi
per cent, payable, principal and Interest,
in gold coin. The advantage involved in
the proposed action lies, the secretary
says, in the fact that it removes the am
biguity from our contract obligations
arising from the use of the word "coin"
In expressing obligation in public debts.
He holds that the Word Is understood by
the discriminating debtor to mean gold
coin, and that such construction is
proper.
Mr. Gage next recommends changes
in the national banking laws. He would,
as noted in the president's message, per
mit national banks to be organized with
a minimum capital of $25,000, reduce the
rate of taxation on circulating notes to
% of 1 per cent per annum, and per
mit banks now organized to issue circu
lating notes to the par value of their re
funding bonds. He would further allow
such banks to deposit as security with
the treasury greenbacks, treasury notes
or silver certificates, to a total amount
of $200,000,000, against which shall be is
sued national bank notes to an equal
amount. Then for the greenbacks,
treasury notes and silver so deposited
the secretary shall from time to time
substitute refunding bonds to the
amount of $200,000,000, such bonds to be
charged to the banks at market prices.
After the banks have deposited funds
according to the foregoing plan to the
amount of 50 per cent of their capital
stock, they shall be permitted to Issue
bank not's to the extent of 25 per cent
of such deposit, without security except
the assets of the bank, the guarantee
of the government to be extended to all
circulating notes of the bank.
To secure the government against loss,
if any, attaching to its guarantee, a tax
of 2 per cent per annum shall be levied to
create a safety fund. No Issue of na
tional bank notes shall be of a smaller
denomination than $10.
The secretary concludes his report
with a statement showing the menace
of the greenback to the gold reserve,
under the present conditions.
The various features of the report Will
be discussed by The Herald in due sea
son.
THE REFUNDING SCHEME
The figures given in The Herald of the
2Cth ult., showing the true inwardness
of the proposition to refund the county's
bonded indebtedness which at this time
amounts t.. the sum of $CTx,BOO, drawing
1 on the average less than five per rent,have'
; silenced all opposition on the score of
economy. The Herald has conclusively
show n that the refunding proposition, If
carried, will entail a loss to the tax
payers Of two hundred and fifteen
thousan 1 eight hundred and forty-thre->
dollars. It has shown that this large
ana"jnt Would have to be paid out in
addition to the sum of one hundred and
j seventy-eight thousand three hundred
land fifty-seven dollars interest on the
LOS ANGELES HERALD: WEDNESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER V 1897
1 present debt as It stands, making th.t
total outlay for Interest three hundred
and ninety-four thousand one hundred
and ninety-three dollars on a principal
sum of six hundred and seventy-eight
thousand eight hundred dollars.
The sole benefit to be derived by the
taxpayers for this outlay is In the con
solation that they will have twenty-four
years In which to make the payments In
stead of about twelve years as at pres
ent. The game can hardly be consid
ered worth the candle and Los Angeles
county Is not yet, nor is It likely to be.
in a position where It will be obliged to
pay such n high price for accommoda
tion.
Let the county pay its existing In
debtedness as It falls due ln the years
between this and 1910 and thus discharge
the obligations which were placed upon
it long ago with the expectation that the
people living now, who were then looked
upon as "posterity," would pay the in
debtedness as it accrued.
There are plenty of lawful ways for
creating a new bonded Indebtedness for
legitimate improvements to the high
ways and other matters, the cost of
which posterity should help to pay, and
these things will presently be urged up
on the voters with great Insistence.
But the great costliness of the pro
posed refunding scheme is thoroughly
set forth In the tables given elsewhere,
which we reproduce from The Herald of
the 26th ult. ln compliance with numer
ous requests for the same:
At the present time the debt of Los
Angeles county is made up of five is
sues or series of bonds, as follows:
Bonds of— Due, Amount.
1888—6 per cent. Feb.. 1902 $13,000
1884—6 per cent, July, 1904 86,800
ISSs—l'i par cent. July, IMS 267,000
1887—4tt per cent, Jan., 1907 132.000
1590—5 per cent, July, 1910 241,000
Total ! 8078,800
To refund the above debt It is pro
posed to issue $650,000 4 per cent bonds
payable, beginning at the end of five
years, and $34,000 annually till paid or
twenty-four years from date of issue.
It will be seen that the county has a very
small 6 per cent debt, and of the 4H and
5 per cent debt the bonds have but a few
years to run. To extend the present debt,
which Is due and payable in a few years,
to run over a period of twenty-four
years, is not in the least sense a money
making proposition and It Is hard to see
on what grounds the proposed refund
ing scheme can be supported.
In the calculations given elsewhere It is
assumed that the present debt will be
paid off proportionately each year on
each of the series of bonds now out
standing. In this assumption the inter
est to be paid on the present debt will
amount to $178,357, while the Interest to
be paid on the bonds as proposed will
amount to $394,200, making a loss in in
terest to the county of the sum of $215,
--543. To which should be added the cost
Of the special election, estimated at $3500,
or a sum of $215,343, which the county
will be called upon to pay during the
next twenty-four years for the privilege
of refunding. This last amount should
be as much less as the premiums the
bonds may sell for will amount to. This,
however, is too indefinite at this time to
take Into consideration.
From the tables published it will be
seen that it is only for a period of seven
years that a very large sum of money
will have to be provided for to reduce
the existing debt proportionately, and to
provide for this apparently large sum
it will mean In a $100 tax levy the sum of
8 cents on each $100 assessed valuation,
assuming the county's valuation at $100,
--000,000 in round figures.
FOR A LIBRARY BUILDING
The celebration of the twenty-fifth
anniverstary of the founding of the Los
Angeles public library last evening was
a very pleasant occasion. The fact that
over 50 per cent of the founders of the
library are still alive added greatly to
the Interest of the evening and was also
an eloquent tribute to the healthfulness
of our Southern California climate.
The founders builded better than they
knew when they started the public 11
--hrary, and they have reason to be proud
of the results of their public spirit,
thoughtfulness and labor in behalf of
the Institution. It was not so easy
twenty-five years ago to secure ade
quate support for a public library as it
is now, and it is hard enough at the
present time.
In considering the subject of the pub
lic library in connection with last night's
celebration, there are two things that
come most prominently to mind—the ad
vance that has been made in our pub
lic library since it was started and the
present needs of the institution. It is
greatly to be desired that a still greater
advance shall be made In the next
twenty-five years.
An adequate public library build
ing is undoubtedly the greatest pres
ent need. The Herald has frequent
ly urg< <1 that some of our local
capitalists should come to the res
cue with a proposition to furnish
the whole or a part of the capital neces
sary to build and equip a library build
ing. The Times yesterday morning said:
A public spirited citizen of Ijos An
gelas authorizes the announcement that
he will head a list of one hundred
names with a subscription of $10% for
the erection of a new public library
building in this city; that is to say, he
will be one of one hundred men who
shall each give the sum,of $1000 to that
noble object. There are certainly nlnb
ty-ntne other i quaily public spirited cit
izens ln this city who are as ready to
join In such a work. Can we not hear
from th'm?
One hundred thousand dollars would
do very well, while the Individual sac
rifice under the plan proposed would be
comparatively small. There are cer
tainly one hundred persons in Los An
geles who can well afford to give $1000
each for such a praiseworthy purpose.
An adequate library building would be
a great thing for the city. Minneapolis
has had such a building for a dozen years
past, and It has proved, a splendid in
vestment from any point of view. Kan
sas City has a library building. Omaha
Is looking into the matter, If, Indeed, one
has not already been built. Even little
Redlands is building a $60,000 home for
books through the munificence of a
friend to the city. Surely Los Angeles
cannot afford to lag behind In a proces
sion of this kind. Let the $1000 sub
scriptions be forthcoming.
A WAITING POLICY
Secretary Gage's estimate of the
needs of the treasury for the next two
years exceeds the appropriations for the
past two by $32,000,000, while the deficit
in revenues for the fiscal year ending
January 30th next, assuming that cus
toms receipts Under the new law will by
that time equal ordinary expenditures,
is likely to approximate $100,000,000. That
a condition rather than a theory prom
ises to confront the treasury is doubtless
fully appreciated by Mr. McKinley and
his financial secretary, and, whereas the
former talks low ln his message about
the need for retrenchment in expendi
tures and never once hints nt the possible
failure of the Dingley law to produce ex
pected revenues after the first year, anx
iety upon his part Is not likely to de
crease as the session progresses. And,
although no appeal Is made ln terms for
such amendment of the customs and In
ternal revenue laws as Will tend to bring
receipts within sight of expenditures,
that would seem to be no less a neces
sity to force itself upon the managers of
the party in the house, as time passes
and the gap is not closed by the natural
occurrence of events.
WEBB ARRESTED
The arrest of Director Webb of the
board of education upon an indictment
by the grand Jury charging him with
extortion, which occurred yesterday af
ternoon, was not unexpected in the
light of recent occurrences.
While the investigation that Is being
conducted by the board of education was
essential to the bringing out of the facts
in the school board scandal, it became
evident some time ago that the ends of
justice would not be served through such
investigation alone. Criminal proceed
ings were necessary, and the grand
jury was not lacking information and
facts upon which to proceed.
Mr. Webb has not yet been found
guilty. He will have a fair trial, and
there Is no danger that he will be
wrongly punished.
♦»♦■
The unfortunate fate of the Are bond
election yesterday was doubtless due to
a sympathetic influence from the in
evitable rejection of the school bond
proposition. Less than two thousand
citizens took the trouble to go to the
pulls, 194S votes being cast in the Are
bond and 1912 in the school bond elec
tion. The school bonds found only 541
supporters to 1371 opponents, while 1207
eitiens voted against the fire bonds and
741 for. The result of the school elec
tion may be taken as a distinct rebuke
to the majority of the present board of
education.
The president's attitude regarding the
struggling Cubans may be good states
manship, but the language of his mes
sage consorts strangely with the verbi
age of the platform upon which he was
elected. "We believe the government of
the United States should use its influ
ence and good offices to restore and give
independence to Cuba." Give Sagasta
a show!
"No interest-bearing bonds ln time
of peace," was the shibboleth of the
Republicans when Cleveland was con
sorting with the Morgan syndicate. But
Mr. McKinley endorses the course of his
predecessor, and foreshadows a possi
ble necessity for instituting it. How
dreadful that will be!
Mr. Alger has a habit of paying for
things out of his own pocket. Mr. Sher
man, once upon a time, recorded his con
viction that the Michigan statesman se
cured a few delegates ln a national con
vention by methods not less direct.
The message is, after all, quite harm
less. Congress usually seeks Information
as to the wishes of the executive and
then—does the other thing. It is about
time for a break in administration ranks,
anyway.

ON THE STREET
It seems strange that the police com
mission, which has hitherto developed
commendable seal ln endeavoring to en
force the law, should continue to neglect
the notorious transgression of the sa
loon ordinance. The Herald has re
peatedly pointed out Che flagrant oases
of several saloons, whose proprietors,
beyond closing their main entrances,
absolutely disregard the law that pro
hibits the sale of liquor after midnight
and on Sunday. The proprietors of the
Hollenbeck and the Hoffman saloons
continue to sell liquor at all hours of
every day and night, with positive im
punity and apparent protection. The
police commission cannot plead ignor
ance of the condition of affairs, nor
surely will Chief Glass pretend that
there could be any difficulty ln securing
a conviction. The question naturally
arises: Why are these places consid
ered beyond or above the law? The
people make the laws and expect that,
so long as they remain on the statute
book, they should be enforced by the
officers who are paid by the public purse
for that purpose. Will the authorities
kindly Inform a puzzled public why this
open violation is winked at?

The ruling powers of an erstwhile pop
ular club are said to be ln a state of
commotion over the attitude taken by a
number of ex-members, who have de
clined to pay up a $25 call, which was
rather unceremoniously sprung upon
the members in the shape of alleged
"dues" for the month of November. Suit
is said to be threatened against the
gentlemen who have shown such a nu
merously retiring disposition, and there
is a prospect of a whole lot of dirty linen
being washed ln public. There are alle
gations that non-interest-bearing cer
tificates of Indebtedness, payable out of
the club's surplus when earned, have
been quietly changed Into interest
bearing negotiable notes, which may
have to be paid out of the pending as
sessment. The directors show a dispo
sition to run things as they please, and
their rule is an Iron one. On dlt that a
weekly paper wh'ch has dared to criticise
the actions of this august tribunal Is to
be boycotted and its advertising patron
aged depleted where possible, as a pun
ishment for taking such a liberty. Mean
time, as the contributions have not come
ln with alarming swiftness and the mem
bership is not increasing to an extent
sufficient to counterbalance withdraw
als, the club cannot be said to be ln a
flourishing condition. All that remains
to give it the coup de grace is another
assessment, which will not come in the
shape of a surprise, as the first one did.

There Is no more cruel Indiscretion
than the forcing of youthful genius. The
seeds of life-long misery are too often
sown by the premature development and
ambitious pressure of talent, which, If
left to the prudent, provident and pro
tecting course of nature, would ripen in
its own good time. The cruel craze for
abnormal features of entertainment,
whether It be the antics of a cockatoo or
the playing of a child "prodigy" pianist,
is not only demoralizing to the specta
tors or the audience, but, ln the latter
case, is often responsible for the ruin
of lives which have been exceptionally
dowered with talent. The strain of per
petual public performances upon a sen
sitive child is entirely unequal and fre
quently Intolerable, the almost inevit
able result being a nervous breakdown
and tho blighting of brilliant prospects.

Boy and Baby
He is a very young boy. His is the
age when a lofty contempt for the oppo
site sex manifests itself; the contempt
which usually finds merciless retribution
in later years. His task of watching the
baby was not as distressing as It might
have been. He had utilized the baby
carriage as a cradle and had found a
place where the iloor sloped a little. Be
hind the vehicle he extended himself,
and with head on hand proceeded to read
a story paper. An occasional pull at a
string fastened to the rear axle impart
ed the motion necessary to keep the
•lumberer from waking. But the baby
soon had its nap out, and began to cry.
The boy paid no attention to the noise,
and after awhile his sister came to in
vestigate.
"Why don't you try to find out what's
the matter with baby?" she asked.
"There's no use," he answered, rolling
lazily over and letting go of the string.
"I suppose you are going to lie there
and wait for It to learn to talk so it can
tell you what it's crying about?"
"No," he answered, "being able to talk
wouldn't make much difference."
"Why not?"
"Because It's a girl. Girls most al
ways don't know what they're crying
about. It Just comes natural to them to
do it."—Detroit Free Press.

sponsibility for the sentiments expressed.
Correspondents are requested to cultivate
brevity as far as Is consistent with the
proper expression of their views.)
Two Questions Answered
To the Editor of the Los Angeles
Herald —What has become of the law
suit of Mr. Spreckels vs. the San Fran
cisco Examiner? What Is the entire cost
to the state of the Durrant case?
Los Angeles, Dec. 6. O. M. H.
(L The suit is still pending. The plain
tiff has been unable thus far to get ser
vice on Mr. Hearst, the proprietor of the
Examiner. 2. No official estimate has
been made of the cost to the state of the
Durrant case, so far as we are aware.)
THE HEAVENS IN DECEMBER
A Full Moon Tonight and a New Moon
on the 23d
The sun enters the sign Caprlcornua
on the 21st of December and the astro
nomical winter begins. The sun, as the
word solar implies, seems to stand still
for a few days, and then turns his face
to bless the northern nations with in
creasing light and heat.
The moon fulls on the Bth, and some
few hours later is In conjunction with
Neptune. The phase of the last quarter
occurs on the 10th, and two days later
there Is conjunction with Jupiter. On
the 21st Uranus and Saturn are in con
junction, followed the next day by
Venus and Mars. The last new moon
for the year comes on the 23d, and the
succeeding day the conjunctions for the
year between moon and planets are
closed by Mercury being occulted by
Luna. The quartering of the moon
takes place on the 30th, leaving the moon
eight days old when the New Year
makes its appearance. The full moon
In December Is so far up In northern
declination that It will hardly seem as
near to us or as friendly as the beauti
ful harvest moon did in August.
Venus is making her adieus to her
public nowadays, and she falls to cut
much of a figure as the year draws to a
close, but we shall have her shining most
radiantly in the western shy shortly
after the new year makes its appear
ance. The fair queen deigns to smile
upon her subjects as she passes them,
being in conjunction on the Bth with
Uranus, on the 12th with Saturn and on
the 30th with Mars. All of these meet
ings are quite close, the last being the
closest. On the 22d there is conjunc
tion between the moon and Venus, but as
the new moon comes ln the following day
we can readily imagine how faint will
be the disk.
Saturn is a morning star and Is grad
ually getting brighter and more distinct
as he moves away from the sun.
Jupiter reaches the quarter post in
his Journey on the 30th, being that day
ln quadrature with the sun. He now
reigns almost supreme ill the morning
sky, as Venus Is drawing too close to the
sun to be very much of a rival. His size
and brilliancy are also on the Increase,
and the early risers have a line treat
prepared for them some hours before
sun-up. In one respect Jupiter seems
like a minor sun, as he Is royally attend
ed by a group of planets that we call
moons. We see their orbits so nsarly on
the edge that the moons seem to be slid
ing back and forth across and behind
the disk and to varying distances on
either side. The motion is so swift and
the means of comparison by one another
and the planet so excellent that they

can be seen to change, their places, be
occulted, emerge from shadow and
eclipse the planet in an hour's watching.
Uranus also ranks among the morning
stars and Is to be found In the zodiacal
area known as the Scorpion.
Mars takes place with the morning
stars, but he is still so very near the
sun that he falls to shine for our unaided
vision to distinguish him. He is In con-
Junction with the moon on the 22d and
with Venus on the 30th. Under more fa
vorable circumstances the gradual
drawing together and separating of
these bodies would be a grand and Inter
esting sight.
Mercury, the rapidly moving, restless
member of the brotherhood, reaches the
far eastern swing of his pendulous at
traction to the sun on the 20th, and for
a few evenings before and after that
date we can see him shining for a few
minutes after the sable covering closes
out the light of day. He ranks as an
evening star and Is the only one re
maining ln that group for the entire
month.—New York Times.
The Folly of Paternalism
The people must get rid of the idea
that the government's business Is. in
any sense, to take care of them. Until
they do shed that ineolerable civic su
perstition they will not enjoy true free
dom, regulated by laws Intended not to
care for, but solely to protect the liber
ty of the Individual, and when each In
dividual's freedom is safeguarded the
freedom of all must be. Paternalism Is a
badge of Imperialism. Its practice
would be intolerable to the very people
who are urging their countrymen to
help them establish a despotism of the
majority.—Chattanooga Times. ,
Waste of Energy
"It will not be long," remarked the
amiable old gentleman, "before corporal
punishment Is wholly obsolete."
"Yes," remarked the man with severe
lines ln his face, "when you observe
what boys of all ages will stand'Wlthout
flinching In a football game, it really
doesn't seem worth while."—Washing
ton Evening Star.
Aigrettes and Tips for the Hair
Aigrettes, both black and white, with
tiny ostrich tips, or bows of black velvet
with a diamond pin, are worn In the hair
for evening dress; but one feather rising
from a little twist of velvet Is a most ap
proved fashion. A cut-steel bow with a
white osprey is another novelty.—New
York Sun.
A Dangerous Critic
"Won't you play sometning, MuuinsT"
asked Kilduft, motioning towards tha
piano.
"I hardly like to while Col. Gore is
here."
"Is he severe In his criticisms T"
"Yes, and he carries a pistol."—Har
lem Life.
Differing Treatment
"I always have my husband sit next
the aisle, so he won't make me uncom
fortable when he goes out between acts."
"H'm! I always sit next the aisle my
self, so I can make my husband uncom
fortable when he attempts to go out be
| tween acts."—Detroit Free Press.
Doubts
"There's some mistake," said tha re
turned Klondlker, as he crawled from
the box car, "about the fabulous amount
of gold ln Alaska. As to there being an
amount of fabulous gold—well, that la
different."—Cincinnati Enquirer. J
