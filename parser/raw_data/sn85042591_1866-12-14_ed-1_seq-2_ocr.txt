John H. Surratt.
' This wan will be i-emeui bored
one of tli principal conspirators in
tli anamination or rresiiieni Ltn
coin, and as escaping toon niter the
hellish work was accomplished- His
whereabouts were discovered some
time since, and Mr. Botiutwell as
sorted that tlie President and Sew
.trd bad kuown wliere he was for
some time; and it was understood
that they had n object in not having
lii in arrested. However, it seems
that measures havo been mud by
them to bring Lira to Justice, but
that until now be has evaded them
Th'c'llouso of Rep.-ec8ntativea'cal!leci
for tho correspondence and fuels in
tho case, and they were furnished.
Brti fly, the movements of Surrntt
are aa follows :
After the assassination, Surralt
went to CsniulA, and was protected
by. the Catholics, though probaMy
unkuown to them, and then went to
the city of Londonderry, uud wus in
the Catholic Oratory, staying there
nnlil early in the present year, when
be went to Rome, here ho enlisted
iu the Pupal Zouaves, where he serv
ed under the name of John Warren
After his arrest, ho escaped from a
guard of six men. Iiuiuodiatc meas
ures were lukeu to rearrest him. He
trucked to a hospital iu Sara,
then to Naples, posting at tho latter
place under the namo of Walters.
From Naples he look a steamer lor
Alexandria, und was arrested as soon
as he got there. It U suid that a
witness, who furnished most of the
clues as to where Surratt was, is on
his way to this country, as a witness
against him. He served in the same
company, and the' were very Inti
mate ; Thero will undoubtedly be
light thrown on many things iu re
gard to tho conspiracy that have not
been known.
'
Hon,; F. C. Lqlllond, the gentle-
man who represents tho full District
our district tho district that Han
cock County is In the, district that
elected Dill Mungen this Fall from
whom we seldom hear, made n speech
in the Houso the other' day. ' The
speech was not very remarkable and
should not refer to it, only he
aid that the .Democratic party did
not want Johnson nnd would not
bare tdm, that Johnson had done
their party more hurt than good, and
that their party hud never taken
Johnson up, nor the Johnson party
them up. Mr. Schenck said that he
didn't supposo that either party did
take up the other -lie wouldn't of
course put it that way but he
thought that each party toolc' tlie
other . , ' ,
It is strange that Mr. LeDlor.d
should deny that tho Copperhead and
Johnson parties worked together
during the campaign, for they dii'.
Ijils true, that bo was silent during
the. time and took no part, but he
comprises but n small part of the
party, lie should speak Tor himsell
and uot for the party that wus sold,
'The House, on Tuesday, passed f
blll'iiroviding that the Clerk of the
Houkc, shall not placo upon its rolls
the names of ' members from: any
State lately iu rebellion till the Leg
islativc Departments, ol the Govern-
uieut ahull have declared sutli States
entitled to Representatives, and has
recognized their GovernmenU. An
other bill was made tho special order
for Thursday,'' providing that no
State shall tie entitled to representa
tion lu the Electoral CJlcge until it
has representatives iu Congress.
The Senate passed both of theubuve
uilli. ' ' " . ' .
Uaydiond, of the N. V. Times, is
not at all troubled with modesty .
At tho first Republican caucus, in
Washington, utter Congress met, he
mado his appearance- ami claimed an
cquul right with the balance of the
members to counsel as to tho course
to be lolloMed during the session. -
Some one made a remark as to his
light to be present, ami ho claimed
that ho never hud strayed from the
paths ol Republicanism, and was all
right. ' lie dunned thut. the i'hila
delphia Convtuliou was all light and
that the addresa was proper At
uie'ituou it.... Of course, be has
lorgollun thai he and his paper did
all in hie uud iu weak way to break
up the party. Oh, Raymond) ,whou

A Shameful Case.
; The prime, of ject of tho vagrant
acts which wero,. passed in all the
Southern States invmediascly after
the ratification of the amendment
abolishing slavery, Is well illustratei)
by the following;. ., ,,
Rev. William l'tncucr, a colored
missionary who was preaching to.
and teuchiug peoplu of his own race,
iu l'iko county, (iuorgis, uud who
has a salary of $35 per month, paid
by.. tho Georgia Kqual Rights Asso
ciation, which receives its funds from
Northern benevolent societies, was
arretted aa a vagrant und sentenced
to tho chain gang for twelve mouths
W hen arretted and convicted ho was
in receipt of his salary; was fndo
pendent in his circumstances, and
was doing much good as a preacher
of the gospel aud a. teacher., Hie
case was carried from one court
another, and, bis 'conviction was af
firmed by the highest courts to which
the ease went, the court holding that
tne in oi in ii net no right to send mon
ey South to pay for such cervices,
und, that such support was so preen
rious as to msKe one who was do
pendent uuon it a vagrant ' '
, Thcso fact! are matters of cfTIclal
record, and will be brought to the at
teution of Congress in a few days.
