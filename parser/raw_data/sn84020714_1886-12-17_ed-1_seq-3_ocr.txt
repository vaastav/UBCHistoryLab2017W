jgf We direct special attention to ao
article, in this issue, from Dr. Satchwell,
in regard lo the terrible habit of using
opium, morphine, &c. The article is
copied from the Goldsboro Methodist Ad
vance, and we beg every man and woman
to read it, and be on their guard against
the insidiousness of opium, parstgoric, mor
phine, laudanum, fcc. A man or woman
may be able to quit the habit of drinking
liquor of any sort, but only the Lord and
skillful physicians can help him through
the pains and anguish of quitting opium,

"The object of Mr Beck's bill to re
lire the United States legal tenders and
national bank notes of small denomina
tions, aud issue coin certificates in lieu of
them, is clearly to put gold and silver on
exactly the same footing, and will com
mend itself to the vast majority of the
people who believe that they ought to
occupy that equal relationship. The bill
also provides that instead of gold and sil
ver certificates, hereafter com certificates
shall be issued, and that all gold and sil
ver certificates outstanding shall be re
tired. This, if enacted, will effectually
abolish . the artificial discrimination be
tween the two standards of our currency,
and would be a long step in the direction
of an absolute coin security for circula
tion. The bill, however, will have to con
tend with the influence of Wall-street
theories atevery stage of its consideration,
and the prospect of its passage is very
dubious. Richmond Whig.
A measure like Mr Beck's would, in
deed, relieve the people, but Mr Cleve
land and his Cabinet will oppose' it. The
President's message shows that he is a
Wall street gold bug, opposed to silver
money, and only favors the imaginary
"gold-standard." Why have not the one
and two dollar silver certificates, author
ized by Congress 6 or 8 months ago, been
issued for the relief of the people? A
Democratic House of Representatives
bhould oill on the President for an ex
planation better than the flimsy one that
the workmen were slow. That is no ex
cuse for the Treasury Department. A
silver dollar buys just as much bread and
meat as a gold dollar, and it is time for
the gold theorists to stop grumbling and

Idf Suppose that all our merchants
determine, by sacred agreement, to ship
all their freight over one particular line
of Railroad, and not send a pound by any
other route, would it not cause a just
rate of freight to be established by the
nou-palrpnized lioads. That's the way
Italeigb did some time ago, and she got
better rates and better treatment.
It is well known thai we have always
been a friend to the Railroad manage
mentsin this State, but as a friend to the
business of Charlotte as well as to Rail
roads, we ask that Charlotte be allowed
fairer freight rates than she now has.
Why should not Charlotte have as
cheap rates from Northern cities' as
Columbia, Augusta, Atlanta and Chatta
nooga?

Proper Action. The N. C Board of
Agriculture in session in Raleigh last
week, adopted the following resolutions :
Resolved, That it is the opinion of this
State Board of Agriculture now assembled
that what is known in commercial circles
as the purchase or dealing in "futures" is
but a species of gambling, whether it be
in ootton, corn, pork, wheat or any other
farm produce, and highly injurious to
farming generally.
Resolved, That this state Board of Agri
culture recommend and petition the legis
lature, in their wisdom, to enact such
laws as will prohibit the dealing in such
futures in North Carolina ; also to pro
hibit the collection of all debts or obliga
tions arising from such sales, purchases or
contracts by any Court of Ihe btate.
We hope the Legislature will pass the
most Btringent law that h possible to pre
vent gambling in "futures." Hundreds of
the best men in the State have been ruin
ed tnd impoverished by such respectable
gambling, a species worse than pu-lting
np money in what is called "gambling
hells."
Got. Jarvis from Brazil.
Ex-Gov. Jarvis, Minister to Brazil, was
in Washington last week, accompanied by
Mrs Jarvis. The North Carolina delega
tiou did them the honor to call in a body.
The Ex-Governor was met by a reporter
on his arrival in New York, and he and
Mrs Jarvis are both reported as delighted
with Brazil and its people, and as having
greatly enjoyed their residence among
the South Americans,, who look upou the
United States as a model country in enter
prises, even if they still have a fondness
for monarchical government. Unlike the
European Portuguese, ihe Governor says
the Brazilian people are progressive and
active, and look forward with pleasurable
anticipation in the near future to more in
timate relations of social and commercial
character with the people of this republic.
The trade restrictions which now
force them to buy from England and
France instead of America they hope too
see removed, so that the import trade from
America may soon bear the relation It
should do their great export trade with
this country.

will leave Wilmington daily (except Sun
day) at six o'clock iu the morning, arrive
at Charlotte between three and ' four

place at 11:45 a. m. Thetraiu from Char
lotte for Wilmington will leave that place
about 10 o'clock in the forenoon and ar

to state that all arrangements for the new

The N. C. Agricultural Department.
Retirement of Mr P M Wilson. At
the late meeting of the State Agricultu
ral Society, Mr P M Wilson leudered his
resignation as Secretary to the Stale
Board, to take effect immediately ; it was
accepted, and Mr T K Bruner was appoint
ed to fill the vacancy .until the next meet-
ng of the Board.
We cannot permit the occasion to pass
without expressing our regret at the sev
erance from the office of the services of a
gentleman who had done so much to pro
mote its usefulness and character. Mr.
Wilson is a gentleman of fine natural tal
ent, cultivated under the proper use of
the finest educational advantages, enjoy
ed at home and abroad, by extensive trav
el, and by association with cultivated men.
The Agricultural Department is an impor
tant one, under-valued now, perhaps, but
destined to expand as agriculture and its
kindred subjects rise in dignity and . ap
preciation,. as they must do as agriculture
rises to its position as a pursuit fouuded
upon science as well as muscle a position
it must take to keep abreast with the com
petitive struggle of the world for supre
macy.
Other states and other nations have ad
vanced to a recognition of this fact ; and
our Agricultural department has leut its
best energies to tend oar people'; to the
same point. To this end, the talent, the
acquirement, the industry and the man
ners of Mr Wilson have been given with
hearty and liberal profusion. In the pros
ecution of his purpose he has been brought
in association with the soientihc, the ex
perienced, and the praotical men of both
continents, and we are proud to see that
he has sustained himself as the peer of the
highest, honoring himself, and reflecting
honor upon his State and his Department.
lie retires to pursue private aims which
usefully employ his talents, with richer
rewards, we hope.
He is succeeded for the present by Mr
T K Bruner, long associated with the Sal
isbury Watchman, and editor of the Min
ing column of that Department. Devoting
himself to certain specialties, Mr Bruner
has acquired a knowledge and experience
which make him a proper successor of Mr
Wilson, and we do not thick the Depart
ment can do a wiser thing.than make the
appointment a permanent one. Asheville

A special in the N. Y. Times from

"Col. Ellison S. Kent, a prominent

and wheat crops were entirely destroyed
by the frost last January : that the corn
crop was ruined by the spring floods and
that the cotton crop will not exceed 4U
per cent of last year's crop. There is not
a farmer, he says, who has made expenses.
The condition of the white people is bad
enough, but that of the blacks is sorrow
ful. At least one-half of them will nave
to leave the county. They have nothing
with which to buy shoes or clothing, and
the white people are powerless to aid
them."

he Drummer's License Tax Sustained
f , by the Supreme Court.
A few weeks since there was a case
argued in the Supreme Court involving
ihe constitutionality ol the drummers'
icense law, from which the State derives
au annual revenue of abouc $80,000. The
case was Slate vs Long, from Rowan.
The defendant. Long, a resident of Balti
more, and a salesman ot a mercantile bouse
u lhat city, sold to a merchant in sails-
bury goods by wholesale (with samples)
without bavins; paid to the Slate Treas
urer the license lax on drummers. There
upon the Court below held the defendant
to be guilty, and the supreme Uourt af
firmed the judgment rendered Chief
Justice Smith delivering . the opinion.
Extract from the opinion:
"The defendant was charged with vio-
aling section 28, of chapter 175, of the act
of 1885, which imposes the tax on drum
mers. 'The question was whether the re
bate authorized in section 25 was in con
flict with the Federal constitution. This
section imposes a tax on purchases of mer
chants: "Dealers paying., a -drummer s
tax, prescribed in section 28 shall be al-
owed a rebate of that amount on bis or
their purchase tax for the same time."
The Court say, as merchants residing
out of the State, and sending their trav
eling agents into the state, can nave no
rebate unless tLey have here a business
label to the purchase tax, it is insisted
that this is a discrimination against non
resident merchant, unwarranted by the
constitution of the .United elates, .and is
the same as if the drummer's tax was put
upon one class and not upon the others.
There is no feature in the statute tbit
distinguishes between resident and " non
resident itinerant salesmen, or between
their employers. Both must pay the same
privilege tax
nor is any differ
ence made in respect to plaoe of manufac
ture of the goods to be sold. Ihe rebat
ing provision applies to all who pay the
purchase tax. Non-resident may have
stationary business in the State, and is
equally entitled to the rebate.
If the benefit does not come lo him, it
is because he has not the tax to pay from
which the reduction comes. The
disadvantage is with the resident, who is
compelled .o pay a tax from which the
principal of the non-resident drummer or
himself, non-resident is exempt. There is
no forbidden discrimination in the legisla
tion itself, and hence it is sought to be
found in the practical operation of the
aw. &c. State vs Miller, 93 N. C. Re

About Earthquakes. Gen. Martin D.
Hardin, of the United states Army, in a
recent lecture in New York city, said that
the accepted theory ot earthquakes was
that the surface of the earth was a mere
shell thirty to thirty-five miles thick. This
theory, however, Gen. Hardin thought,
required much credmhty from its believers.
The molton mass inside was hardly believ
ed in, although an igneous fluid doubtless
exists, especially in volcanic regions. The
speaker, however, noticed in his sojourn in
the mountain region of .North Carolina
that a great rainfall in that part of the
country produced no visible increase in
the streams there. By a peculiarity of
the soil the falling water Beems to be ab
sorbed and buried, lie prophesied some
commotion as long ago as July last, and
when the Charleston earthquake came de
clared that they were the "commotion" he
had foretold. Steam generated by the
coutact of water with hot' stones was", in
Gen. Hardin's opinion, the cause of the
earthquakes.
IdT0 The N. C. Conference expelled
Rev. Dr. Bagwell, one of its ablest and
best equipped men. It is very apt to deal
promptly with offenders and it keeps no

borne himself well for the past six months
and will not go to the wall covered with
obloquy. He is too able and useful a man
to easily succumb to misfortune or to be

Charleston Relief Committee
Charleston, S. C, Deo.
Report.
14. The
earthquake relief committee, headed by
Mayor Courtney, made a formal report to
the city council of the total amount' con
tributed by the country in general for the
relief of the earthquake sufferers, togeth
er with the disposition they have made of
the same. The labors of the committee
are now nearly finished. and from their
report the following facts are obtained :
The total amount of the various sums
received by the committee up to date ag
gregate $815,000. Of this sum New York
city contributed $152,673 ; New York
State (outside New York city) $30,000
Boston, $76,900; Baltimore, $37,966; New
Orleans, $7,753, and San Francisco, $16,-
070. The remainder was contributed by
the other States and Territories of the
Union, nearly every one ot- whioh sent
something.. In addition' to the above,
handsome sums were also received from
many countries of the Old World. The
citizens of South Carolina contributed to
the relief fund. $18,208. In addition to
ihe above the following sonsiderable
amounts were contributed to private par
ties and for rebuilding shattered churches
and charitable institutions : Episcopal
churches, $35,000 ; Catholic, $20,000
Presbyterian, $15,000 ; Baptist, $10,000 ;
Lutheran, $5,333; Hazel street synagogue,
$5,000 ; Hebrew Benevolent Society, . $4,-
500 ; Confederate Soldier's Home, $5,00 0;
the Medical College, $25,000 ; othe char
itable organizations, $20,000 ; for Mason
ic relief, $15,048. From the funds receiv
ed the committee have furnished food,
houses and shelter to 13,000 persons who
otherwise would have been destitute. The
balance on hand is now $186,000. and
from this amount the committee has ap
propriated $86,000 to complete repairs to
injured booses, and the. remainder is to be
devoted to building a city bospital in
place of the one destroyed by the earth

Judge Clark's Opinion - about Judicial
Reforms.
Correspondence of the Raleigh Observer.
We live to little purpose if we do not
gather wisdom as the years go by. Every
change is not progress, but without
change there is no progress. Injudicial
proceedings there is a tendency to ultra
couservatism and the introduction of more
business-like methods is highly desirable.
In the middle ages wbeu our legal sys
tem begau there was little legal business
and at first it was dispatched in a day.
Hence the legal fiction that all the busi
ness of ihe term is as of the first day of
the- term. VV hen, as is the oase with our
Supreme Court, the term as a matter of
iact tasib neany six monins as us spring
session this would be amusing but for the
praotical fact that the business is necessa
rily made to count as of the last day of
the session. The first step lo correct
abuses is to point them out. Now take an
example of the working of this rule. Sup
pose a case tried in August, September or
October in any of our Superior Courts.
Aor appeal is taken. By a little delay in
settling the case on appeal the appeal
stands little chance of being heard at the
fall term of the Supreme Court. It goes
over to the Spring term. It is then argu
ed and the decision announced say in Feb
ruary, March, or April. Owing, however,
to the above mentioned legal fiction of re
garding the whole term as one day the
opinion is not certified down till the court
adjourns say in July, ihe opinion goes
down to the fall term of the Superior
Court and should then stand for trial, but
a rule of court forbids that and the case
goes over to the next Spring term of the
Superior Court. This is to say, no matter
how important or bow trifling a case goes
up to our Supreme Court, the chances are
of eighteen months delay, and very often
twelve months elapse after the opinion of
the Supreme Court is known before clients
are allowed to act upon it. This is not
business. It would -not be tolerated any
where else and ought not to be tolerated
in tne law. . w here the appeals are in
State cases this delay is no less injurious,
and is either unjust to the public or to the
defendant in every instance. The abuse
is palpable. What are the remedies?
Many may be suggested. Ihe writer,
with dimdeuce suggests the following :
1. Instead of retaining all the causes to
be certified down in a bunch at the end of
a six month's term it may be provided
that on the first Monday in each month
all opinions of the Supreme Court which
shall have been on file ten days stall be
certified down. As now, any dissatisfied
party would have his remedy by way of
petition to re-hear at any time within 12
months.
2. The rule that cases should not stand
for trial at the first term of the Superior
Court after the opinion comes down should
be repealed and they should be, ol all
casses, the cases which are tor trial.
3. In State oases where the judgment
of the Court below is affirmed, instead ot
waiting till the next term of the Court for
the useless and absurd formality of resen
tencing the defendant, the Superior Court
Clerk on receiving the opinion should no
tify the sheriff to execute the sentence of
the law already pronounced and affirmed
(except in capital cases) by collecting the
fine, or imprisoning the defendant in jail
or penitentiary as the case may be. In all
cases where the appellant has to remain
in jail pending the appeal this would be a
mercy to him and a great saving in the
aggregate-to the taxpayers. In capital
cases, the Governor upon.beiog notified of
the affirmance -of the judgment by the Su
preme Court, should issue his warrant to
the Sheriff, undet his constitutional au
thority to execute the laws. This is the
coarse adopted in mauy states.
4. The present ouprame Court are able
lawyers and do as much hard work as any
three men who can be found anywhere.
They are overworked. Hearing causes
three hours per day is strain enough. Ihe
fourth remedy suggested is by a constitu
tional amendment to increase the Supreme
Court to five and thereby to enable the
Court to hear causes four hours each day.
The additional hour per day would be six
hours per week or two days added to each
week at the present rateot bearing causes
This would dispose of one-third more cas
es each week and detain counsel a much
shorter time in Kaleigb. With the pres
ent number of judges the increase of the
time now allotted for the hearing of ihe
causes would be impossible.
Our system of appeals in both civil and
state cases is cumbersome and seems fram
ed to add to the "law's delay" which the
great dramatist mentioned as one of the
greatest ills that flesh is heir to. the
above suggestions are made with diffi
dence, but with the hope that the press
