conducted in part In so thin an atmosphere

No Salary Grabber Hot
The reappearance of the Hon SAltURL
SULLIVAN Cox In the House of Represents
ttvos Is a source of satisfaction t every
body Ho add both wit and wisdom I t the
deliberations of Congress Even tho the
gresaional Hcconl becomes more readable
because Cox Is back engaged again in time
work for which nature aud experience have
best ntuxl him
Some of time Republican nowspapors in
Ohio notably tho narrow and hobotudluoua
sheet published in Cleveland by Mr EDWIN
Cowbii have circulated tho falso story that
Mr Cox has drown or Intends to draw two
salaries namely that of tho Minister to Tur
kc and that of Congressman for tho tlmo
between the date of Mr PuMrzBKs resig
nation and that of his own resltfiuitlon as
Minister According t the law and
the decisions of tho auditing officers of tho
Treasury Mr Cox Is technically entitled t
2500 more or loss tho salary of the Con
grossman for the Ninth district of Now York
accrued since the pressure of private fairs
force tho lon JOSEPH PULMZEII out of
public life During the greater part of this
period however Mr Cox wns drawing hid
salary as Minister t Turkey
A wo bOo already remarked Mr Cox Is
not that sort of a man Ho has already lC
fused t tko advantage of tho flaw In the
law which put within his reach an unoiirned
salary He ole Introduced lu time Houso
of Representatives a bill designed to prevent
just such grabs and no doubt he will call up
time measure again at the enrllvnt opportunity
Mr Cox Is not the man to make an exception
for his own pecuniary benefit where a jnatter
of principle is involved Nobody who known
him ixpocted that ho would do otherwise
than ho has dont
Fourteen years ago next February Mr
Cox arose iu the House of KoproBoiittUlvi8
t protest against the Infamous salary grub
which the Fortysecond Congress was then
contemplating In denouncing the proposed
act ho watt almost I not quite alone HH
voted steadily against the grab at every
stage and ho voted against the bill lu which
the steal was Incorporated and when tho
grab went through ho was among the Ilrst
to return t the Treasury time 5000 which
became his slinro of the Illgotten spoils
This record of scrupulous integrity In tho
matter of his own pecuniary lolatlons with
the Government ho serves ought to ho

Governor HiiOi hn now under consldnra
thou I uetiilou ugitlust the execution of Mrs
IloxAWSA UncBG of Wurrsa Mrs DIIOBE
with her daughter murdered her husband
lu December iBdi Ho bad It is charged for
years treated her with brqlol cruelty On
the morning the day ot time murder he Is
Bald t have threatened her lifo Tim daugh
ter was Imprisoned tor life Mrs DIIUKE was
sentenced t bo hanged on Dec 2
At tho hearing before tho Governor the
prosecution asserted tbat the nmrdur was
premeditated and that both Mrs DnCBE and
her daughter wore of bad character Ad
mitting that these assertions are true tho
question remains Ought 0 woman to b
hanged even for premeditated murdorV Is
not public sentiment averse to the execution
of a woman no matter how great anti cleat ly
proven her crime It id this question
doubtless rather than the guilt of Mrs
DBUBE which Oov HILL will consider
Accepting the verdict of the jury iu this
particular case Is It not still the general
opinion lu this State at least that no woman
should bo hanged I It IB wo believe more
than a generation since nny woman criminal
h been executed lu NewYork ThIs Is
Significant of the popular feeling Lot a
woman bo n guilty as she can she is still a
woman and so it Booms a barbarous u well
as an Indecorous thing to execute her on tho
scaffold She should b and usually in I sent
t prison for life Probably no jury would
find a woman guilty of I murder I It expected
that she would b hanged It Is iu the in
terests of justice a well n of public do
serum and humans feeling that no woman
should b banged
We imagine that this U tho conclusion
t which Oov HIM will come in the case of
Mrs DBCBE
The Case of Father fllcHlyun
As a matter of course throve Is no truth iu
the story that the Ilev Dr McOLYNN hud
declared his intention of plumply refusing to
obey the summons to Rome to niche ex
planation of his coursn during tho UuouaE
campaign and his rebellious attitude toward
his ecclesiastical superiors
He would not take such 1 stop unless hu
were prepared to break away wholly from
the Roman Catholic Church and bold n
man as ho Is l be would tremble ut tire
thought of Incurring tho fate of OAVAI
and HYACINTH Yet no ono cnn read the ex
pressed opinions of Father MCOLVNN dur
ing recent yearn amid more especially since
he espoused tire cal U of HENIIY Gnojtai
without being iintUlled that he In out of bar
mony with the policy and sentiment of his
Church More than hat t his views touching
social questions seem to be In some respects
at total vurlunco with both Catholic und
Protestant teaching nnd practice BO Unit If
he went nut from Rome ho would hind no
resting place elsewhere
In an Interview published a few wrecks ng < >
Dr McGLYNN was reported to have fix
pressed opinions which wore contrary to tire
whole theory of tire Church however ngi en
able they might bo to I student of uockty
whoso judgment was not influenced by re
ligious faith or theological Uuejiliw Tire
doctrine that tho poor will fled cnnipeimn
tlon In heaven for tho borrows nf thrlr
earthly lot the priest was reported to Intvit
said ia not tho doctrine to pleach to honest
laborers of this century and society cau lied
lu OEOROEH theory regarding time < mnersbl >
of land limo only adequate prescription for
the ills of modern clvillnttlon Time temetly
Is secular and notrollglouo according to this
report of Dr MCGLYXNS opinions
This of co wee Inn view exactly opposite
to that of tho Church uud Although Dr
MoGLYNN has denied tho accuracy nf the
Interview as published other utterances of
hU with reference to this particular subject
have been o time sumo tone and purport In
his speech at Ohlekeriog Hal at the opening
lug of tbe Labor campaign bo extolled
HKxnr GEOIMIE as the author of a plan
which offered a panacea for those Ills of soci
ety and raised him to a sublime place among
the benefactors of mankind
I was therefore Inevitable that the priest
should b called t account by his eccle
siastical superiors and that his declarations
of opinion should b brought to the atten
Rome for Involvon fundamental
ton of omo thoy 1 fundamentl
question ot faith and doctrine But when
Dr McObYKN goes to Rome In obedience t
tho summons ho has received a wo assume
ho will do after a brief period for prepara
tion It Is not improbable that Jie will so
modify statement ot his views as t bring
opinion touching
thorn within tire range of tuchlnl
secular questions allowable for a priest of
tho Church end unquestionably such a
of less hasty utter
modification more or 10 haty uttr
ances wit bo required of him
Dr McOLYNN Is too much devoted t his
priestly work to invite a broach with his
Church outBId of which ho would b power
less helpless und wretched beyond descrip
tion Ills career would be ended and ho
would sink into the place of men like
OAVAZZI and HVACINTHE

Secretary Endlcotl Implies that nothing

that this gallant officer t whose Krait endu

IHiLADELrniA Dec Occasionally this
city gets thoroughly shaken up It shaking
now and the cause of It II the gas works
There are some prospective dealt which roach
Into the millions The plant U I very valuable
and the city owns It It Is now proposed to
lease I the works Public sentiment U appar
ently divided and already there U talk of
00 boodle and bribery and all that
For many year the oltr has tried to run the
BBS works through tbs agency of trutsell ap
pointed by the City CouncilsiQreat loans were
negotiated to build and extend the works and
tbe truttsM wire a necessary adjunct Thai
loans hay all ben paid off and now the city
owns tb works absolutely The Question li
Shall the oily run the work or lease them to
urlvato Individuals
This gins works bare been source 01 political
corruption ror rare In addition to this fact that
