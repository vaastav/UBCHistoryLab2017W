Didn't He?
The'Newport Express and Stan
dard "strains at a knat and swallows
a camel" in defending Appelman.the
erstwhile professor of the U. V. M.
and all-the-time pro-German of the
Bernstorff class. The Express and
Standard says the treatment of Ap
pelman would have been justified
had he advocated pro-German senti
ments. We say yes. Didn't he? A
man sent to this country by the Im
perial government of Germany to
"teach and lecture" because his ser
vices were more valuable to his gov
ernment here than they would be on
the battle front, comes pretty near
sowing broadcast at every opportu
nity German sentiments. He was a
sneaking cur; a snake in the grass
and America has been altogether too
lenienc to that class of enemy aliens
whe by subtlety and underhand
methods have attempted to throttle
democracy and stay the world-wide
march of liberty and justice. It is
just such men as Appelman who are
putting obstacles in the way of this
government, retarding war work and
making greater the number of
American lads who must sacrifice
their Jives. We have no sympathy
for Appelman. By his own words
he has convicted himself as a hire
ling of the Kaiser, spying out Ameri
can methods, ways, means and teach
ing German sentiment, aiding the
German propaganda, and all for the
benefit it would be to the Imperial
government of Germany. Such a
man is a pio-Germana fiendish ras-.
cal and there is no apology called for
in the treatment he has received.
He ought to have been booted into
the Atlantic and made to submarine
it to his "Imperial Government"
long before the head 'of German
deviltry in this country the arch
fiend Bernstorff was sent home.
The local fuel committee, L. A,
Cobb, A. W. Bosworth, E. M. Bart
lett are earnestly working to adjust
the fuel problem for this place, and
their article in another column ask
ing each resident of Island Pond to
report their needs ior fuel should
be heartily rerponded to. The fuel
committe have no authority in theis
line but with the co-operation of "the
citizens the situation can be taken
care of and every family get a sup
ply of fuel. This section of the state
-should not rely on coal for fuel, and
certainly with the present demands
for coal by the government, places
where there are plenty of wood for
fuel should use it and release for
war work the thousands of tons
heretofore coming into these sec
tions. To safeguard our own needs
in this matter should be sufficient
reason, but at this time we have the
call to serve our government and we
should loyally meet the situation and
do all possible to aid the fuel com
mittee in their work.
Congress re-convened Monday and
Tuesday President Wilson delivered
his message. The main work of
Congress as called for, is to" win the
war." "Nothing," the President
says, "shall turn us aside from it
until it i3 accomplished." No peace
with autocracy ; but wlien the Ger
man people speak through an accredi
ted representative then peace will
come. Never again must the peace
of the world be rendered by a one-
man power. The message called for
a delaration of war against Austria
and the House and Senate passed
resolutions almost unanimously for
the same. This session will likely
last until the next fall elections and
possibly until next December. There
is trying work ahead for every mem
ber and Vermonters know their dele-
eation will be found loyal to the

urges the citizens to call a town

Don't Need So Much Sugar
New England is to get a supply of
sugar but not so long as war lasts it
is the part of wisdom to learn to be
economical with sugar. Miss Terrill
says that the average American uses
eight to ten times as much sugar
as the average Greek yet the Greek
is just as strong and healthy as any
other man. There are many diseases
that are aggravated by over indul

COMING, "Womanhood" or The Glory of a
"GESUNDHEIT" THEN WOE
Citizen of German Origin, Patriotic to
Last Ditch, Makes a Disastrous
Blunder.
This little story, which appears to be
an orphan, Is now $olng around :
"I'm going to the patriotic meeting
this evening," said the citizen of Ger
man origin.
"No," said the wife, "you musn't go.
You'll get into trouble, sure."
But he went, despite her remon
strance. Just before midnight, on the
last street car, he stumbled into his
domicile. The good wife was sitting
up for him.
When he appeared his eyes were
black and blue, his face was scratched
and puffed, his collar had been torn
from his shirt and he looked as though
he had been rolled in the dirt.
"Ah," said the wife, "I told you not
to go to that meeting, that something
would happen to you."
"It was not at the meeting," ex
plained the husband. "The meeting
was all right. There were three
speeches, and, like everybody else, I
applauded everyone of them. The
band played 'the "Star-Spangled Ban
ner." Everybody stood up. So did I.
"It was after the meeting. I was
coming home on the street car. The
car was crowded. Then a woman on
the car sneezed and I said 'Gesund
helt 1' Then everything happened." -
Five Great Men In History.
In the generation that saw the birth
and the earlier years of the republic
five men stand out George Washing
ton, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jef
ferson, Alexander Hamilton and John
Marshall, says James Bryce In the
Youth's Companion. Whether or not
the last four of them were great men
in the full sense of the word Is a ques
tion on which people were not agreed
in the lifetime of those four a'nd are
not agreed today; but everyone felt
then as everyone feels now that Wash
ington was great. He is a world fig
ure. In mere Intellectual power he was
not superior to the other four. He nad
less originality and a less wide range
of capacity than Franklin, .less versa
tile activity of mind than Jefferson,
less brilliant gifts for constructive pol
icy and the exposition thereof than
Hamilton, less logical grasp and pene
tration of thought than Marshall ; but
he rose superior to them all In a cer
tain massive strength of character, In
stately dignity, In a calm firmness of
purpose that neither the smiles nor the
frowns of fortune could divert from
the course his Judgment had approved.
So his primacy was undisputed then
and has remained undisputed evei
since.
AUTHORS AS LONG WALKERS
Dickens, Wadsworth, Southey, Faw
cett and Others Were Classed asv
Pedestrians of Prominence.
It is calculated that Wordsworth, In
his many years of sauntering, must
have traveled a distance of 180,000
miles. What sights he saw during such
prolonged and delightful wanderings
only those who have the poet's mind
and eye can even guess, observes Lon
don Tit-Bits.
Charles Dickens was a confirmed
tramp, and no doubt acquired his ex
perience of "life on the road" from ac
tual acquaintance with all sorts of
vagabonds and odd characters.
One of the most remarkable of un
professional walkers was Professor
Wilson, the "Christopher North,"- of.ltt
erature. , His fine physique and great
endurance, prompted him to the per
formance of wonderful feats, which
seemed to him entirely a matter of
course. He once walked40 miles in
eight hours, and at another- time
iwalked a distance of iJO miles In 24
ihours.
! Henry Fawcett, also, was a tireless
Iwalker, and one who, when deprived
'of sight, did not think of relinquishing
this among many forms of exercise. Ills
was a familiar figure on the roads
about Cambridge, and there Is no ex
aggeration In saying that few men
blessed with nil bis senses could enjoy
nature more throughly than ho.

LY STEVENS
-IN-
7 ACTS
Southey, worn and preyed upon by
mental application and the practical
anxieties of everyday life, found hia
greatest relief In tramping about the
country.
John Stuart Mill delighted in pedes
trian tours, and Charles Lamb, though
he loved town better than country, was '.
one who believed In sweeping cobwebs
from the brain by brisk and continuous
walking.
WOMEN RUN OWN EXCHANGES
Much Expense Is Attached to Conduct
ing These Praiseworthy Enter
prises in Many Cities.
The general management of ex
changes Is about the same, wherever
situated, says a writer in the Woman's
Home Companion. A room or shop is
provided for the reception and display
of women's work, with paid saleswom
en to conduct the exchange on a busi
ness basis, competent bookkeepers reg
istering goods received and keeping ac- (
curate accounts of sales and moneys
due to consignors.
It Is obvious that such an organiza
tion, even on a small scale, is an ex
pensive undertaking and the Items of
rent, salaries, coal, lights, stationery,
wrappings, telephone and postage com
prise a formidable expense account,
which should justly be borne by those
who benefit from Its maintenance. The
revenues to meet expenses are ob
tained In three ways. First, by a small
annual fee of from $2 to $5 from each
consignor whose work Is accepted ; sec
ond, by a stipulated commission of
from 10 per cent to 25 per cent, ac
cording to the size and location of the
exchange, which is deducted from all
sales ; and third, from the dues of the
board of managers and their personal
donations.
Describing Happiness. -.
There are thousands of short story
writers and minor poets who can deal
very effectively with battlefields,
slums, maniacs, shipwrecks, disease
and a thousand forms of human de
generacy, observes the New York In
dependent, but they are Incapable of
making their characters happy with
out making them bored and the read
er likewise. The pessimist declares
that evil, suffering and villainy are the
natural materials of literature be
cause they are the fundamental real
ities of life and happiness is only a
mirage which disappears as one ap
proaches it The only trouble with
this theory Is that It isn't so. We
know plenty of people who have been
happy, though we have yet to meet
the first of them who could describe
how It felt.

Japan la Exporting Pulp.
Japanese Imports of pulp have en

by Import difficulties, has appreciably

Emily Stevens in "The Slacker"
"The Slacker" the big patriotic special
to be shown at the Opera House next
Tuesday, Dec. 11, is a Nation's devotion,
and a Nation's problem expressed in visible
form. No American can see it without
feeling a deeper love and appreciation for
his country than he even knew before.
In the story, Margaret Christy and
Robert Wallace have been engaged for
two years, but he shows no desire to get
married until war is declared. The
announcement is made that single men
will be called first. Then he hurries to
the altar. His wife, intensely patriotic
plunges into recruiting work. Her rela
tives and friends enlist her husband
does not. Finally she learns the truth,
he is a slacker! Shame and anguish over
come her. How she meets her problem
is told in a masterly way which will Thrill
The Spine Of a Nation.
"The Slacker" is a six part production
for which every loyal American will give
profound thanks.
The beautiful Emily Stevens con
sidered the greatest emotional actress on
the screen or on the speaking stage
to-day, plays the leading part in a master
ly and wonderfnl way.
Reserved seats are now on sale at Kane's
Drug store. This production has proven

cities, and the management of the opera
house urges all its patrons to make res
ervations for seats immediately. If

He Didn't Know. ,
Mark Twain and his peculiarities
were being discussed by an English
class in a high school. One youthful
orator had very eloquently described
Mark's personal appearance and had
laid unusual stress on the author's
fondness for wearing white flannels.
"Qeel" said one much-Interested
youth, "I dont see how the public
knows whether his flannels are red or
-white." . '

SIX AND A. HALF BILLION
POUNDS OF MEAT FOOD
"What City and Country Can
Produce in the Form of Poul
try and Eggs. t
If poultry production is doubted next
year, as is readily possible with this city
and country cooperation, we will have
6,500,000 pounds of meat in the from of
poultry and. eggs. This will release
almost that many pounds of other meats,
pork and beef, for our Armies in Europe,
and for the Armies and civilian popula
tion of the Allies.
If we do not produce this amount of
poultry we may find ourselves short of
j meat food to just that extent.
It is a patriotic duty of the utmost
importance that every farmer and every
persou in town do his part in producing
this increase of poultry, which will help
to win the war. It is also a profitable
proposition for the average individual.
Both town and farm families will produce,
at its lowest cost, meat food for their
own use, and by puttiug up eggs for
winter use will further reduce living ex
penses. The poultry will be handled as a by
product of the farm and backyard; each
flock being large enough in number to
utilize the scraps and waste from the
"pid"-up" around the place, supplemented
by some feed. But no flock should be
out of proportion to the ground space
and kitchen wastage not so large that
feed will become, relatively, too costly
an item. The idea is not only to increase
our poultry production, but to do it
economically; to do it with very little cost
by ' turning the waste of kitchens and
baokyards all over the United States into
chickens and eggs. Fowls are the only
medium which a good deal of this waste
can be transformed into a valuable food
product

tion and guaranteed to please the most

of a Nation. Every patriotic American
hould see "The Slacker" at the Opera
House next Tuesday, Dec. 11. Best seats
can now be obtained at Kane's Durg
