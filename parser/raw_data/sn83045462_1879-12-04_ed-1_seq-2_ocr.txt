Tim STAz has a direct wire from its news room to
the Western Union Telegraph offiee in New York
ety. from which wires radiate to all parts of the
globe. and in therefore enabled to secu* the latest
news by Its own operator from every quarter up to
within a few momeuts of going to press. It Is the
only evening paper south of Philadelphia which re
e3tves exclusively the Amociated Prom dispatches.
The Holiday Semsen-Deuble Sheet.
The double sheet, or eight-page STAR of flty*
ilz columns, will be Issued as usual on Saturday,
to meet the demands upon the advertising space.
The number of new advertisements last Satur
day reached 161-which was unprecedented in
the historyof the paper. Advertisers will there
Are confer a favor by sending in their orders as
early as possible for the enlarged and extra
edition.
The Finucial Cietest.
The difficulty in reconciling the views set
orth by the President of the United States in
his annual message and the Secretary of the
Treasury In his annual report, with the views
undoubtely held by a majority of the repre
sentatives of the people and of the people them
selves, grow out of the fact that there is so much
truth and justice on each side of the question.
On the one side, the legal-tender currency is
regarded as temporary In Its character and an
unfulfilled promise to pay; on the other side
there Is a manifest determination that no re
duction in the circulating medium shall be
allowed to Interfere with the wave of prosperity
which has now set in over the whole country,
developing with wonderful rapidity Its resources
and Industries.
The government has recently devised an ex
periment. growing out of the silver quesion,
which may afford a partial or entire solution of
the difficulty in the issue of silver certificates
based upon the deposit of the coin. Why not
do the same with the gold? ^
The gold now held Dy the Treasury for re
SUmption is not part of the circulating medium,
and can.only become so by the redemption of so
many greenbacks; but the people do not want
the gold. hence the greenbacks remain outstand
Ing. It Is well the gold should remain in the
Treasury; it Is more convenient to circulate notes
and more economical as saving the abrasion to
which the coin Is subject But the two hun
dred millions of gold or whatever the amount
held by the Treasury is, might be represented
by that amount of gold certificates payable on
demand, and be substituted for that amount
of legal tender notes. The remaining 146 million
of legal tenders could not possibly be reached
until by allowing'the surplus revenue of the
government to accumulate in gold a further
issue of gold certificates would eventually pro
vide for them.
There could be no better currency than that
afforded by one based as this would be on the
deposit of coin, and It would be practically lim
ited only by the ability of the Government to
acquire coin or the desire of the people to place
Its coin in the custody of the Government.
In the event of an adverse balance of trade,
to which we must look forward as among the
probabilities of the future, the presentation of
the coin certificates to obtain coin for export
would soon raise the rates of interest to a point
at which the export would be unprofitable, or,
at any rate, have as much effect in that direc
tion as does now the action of the Banks of
England and France.
The Political ande Faucial Sita
tion in Virginia.
The republican members of the Virginia legis
lature, with but two or three exceptions, united
with the readjusters In the organization of both
3ouses. This combination was the result of a
bargain, which was carried out by dividing the
legislative officers between republicans and re.
adjusters. The old democratic employes were
turned out to a man, including several disabled
ex-confederate soldiers. By this compact all
chance of the election of a republican to the U.
S. Senate has been destroyed. Gen. Mahone is
the choice of the readjusters, and will, it is said,
be elected on the first ballot, as his party, aided
by their republican allies, has a majority of 23
on joint ballot. Gen. Mahone is a democrat, on
all national questions, and his vote and influence
in the Senate will always be cast with that
party. The republicans of the Virginia legisla
ture have sadly disappointed their party in Its
national organization and purposes. It was
within their power, many of the wisest leaders
believed, to have secured a u.S. Senator, and thus
asm republican control of the Senate from
March, 1881; but the legislators preferred a few
o11es for their immediate friends, whereat the
republican party, outside of Virginia, Is very
Much disgusted.
Gov. Holliday's message to the legislature
was devoted chiefly to the settlement of the
debt, and he served notice upon the read
justers that the McCulloch bill can never be
repealed or altered except over his veto. He
Showed that the progress made towards a settle
ment under the McCulloch plan has been most
satisfactory, and he urged the final adoption of
this plan. The debt-payers are, still, not with
Out hope that the governor's advice may eventu
ally be adopted by the legislature. Their theory
is that the combination of readjusters and re
publicans is only held together by the promise
Of spoils, and such alliances never prove endur
lag. The readjusters, It is said, propose to par
cel out the state offices between themselves and
the republicans in the proportion of their votes,
respectively, but the latter are not content with
this. They insist that as the readjusters could
not accomplish anything without theIr aid, they
(the republicans) should have half the offices,
though numerically much smaller than their
The nilitof Russa ae just failed In their
fourth attempt to asasinate the Czar. This
time they undertook to blow him up with an
infernal machine while he was ena route to Mos
tow, Intent upon his plan for the establishment
of an advisory council or parliament. At this
distance from the scene, and to the American
mind, it would seem that this last attempt of
the nihilists upon the Czar's life must have the
effect of weakening his enemies, even If it does
not create sympathy for him. While he was
endeavoring to comply with what appeared to
be a demand of the masses of the people for
Some sort of participation in the affairs of gov
ernment, it would have been decent, If not poll
tic, to have afforded him every facility for put
flng his plan into operation. The nihiust
amuame to represent the people as against the
heredItary aristocracy; the Czar expressed his
willingness to make concessions to the people,
and while in the act of doing what he supposes
his subjects desIre, he is only saved from being
BIown into the next world by the interposition
et Providence. The pistol has been tried upon
the Czar three times without harm to him. The
firK time was when a peasant named Ossip
Enmmnnaoff rushed in between the Czar and
his would-be assassin Karakasoff, and struck
down the latter's hand in time to prevent the
Bellet from being sent into the august body of
his majesty. The peasant was promoted to
the dignity of a noble for his timely interfer
sDes. The second attempt at assaminanunn was
3Uade In the Bois de Boulbgne, by the Pole
unmonft who fired a double-barreled pistol and
anonls in his purpose. Last April while walking
2nths grounds of the Winter palace, the Czar
wasagain shot at, and though not wounded, was
~; Y7badly frightened. The attempt of the
