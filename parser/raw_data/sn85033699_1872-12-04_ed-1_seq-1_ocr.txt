IMMIGRATION THOUGHTS.
.Suggestions by a ITIde Awako Citizen
Lettar from Peter Staab, Esq.; to the
. State Commissioners of
Immigration.
To the Honorable Board of the Commissioners
.. .' of the State of Tennessee:
The excitement naturally produced on
the minds cf every citizen by the late, elec
', lions, both national and State, having sub-
aided and political issues for the present at
rest, i deem it a proper lime for our people
lo turn their attention to their local affairs,
to tbe advancement oflhe proepaiity and
material welfare of their State. You will
therefore pardon my liberty of addressing a
-ifew suggestions to your .honorable, body in
'regard u -the absorbing topic of Immigra-
It is'hardly necessary for me to point out
, the advantages arisins from the influx of
an industrious population on a large fccale,
' but against tbe enemies of this measure, I
womd propound Just one question: What
would be the result if all those residing
&moug us who came from other States or
countries "were to leave the StaU? And
. again, If their number should be doubled?
Much has been done in the way of speak
ing and printiogon this subject, but, desir
able as it is to enlist the inestimable aid of
the public press in its behalf, the thing most
wanted is action, work. I would, therefore,
respectfully propose to.your body the fol
lowing feasible and practical plan, which if
it, either wnolo or la part, meets witn your
approbation, you may propose to our next
Legislature lo be acted upon:
" 1. Let the Sute 'procure one-fourth or
one-half a million acres of arable land, to
be set apart for tbe sola and exclusive pur
pose, of immigration.
"2. The acquisition of the land could be
easily ch ained, partly from that owned by
the State, partly by donations from iriends
of the cause, and by purchase on a long
credit.
3. The land should be in tracts .of 2 to
3,000 acres, subdivided iu sections of CO
acres, of which every alternate section be
' donated to a bona fide settler, under such
' conditions as the State may prescribe, the
other section to be retained by the State.
4. Every male immigrant of the age of
21, and every widow with one or more
boys, should ba entitled to one section of
GO acres.
5. The State is to warrant the title to
the settler, but the latter to pay all costs
of surveying, etc., as designated by the
State.
G. All products of manufacture to be
exempt from taxation for the term of ten
years, as far as the authority of the State
reaches.
' - 7. The object of large tracts is to facili
tate co-operation and mutual assistance on
the part of the settlers.
H. The State may enter into negotiations
with bodies desiring to establish communi
ties or settlements in a body.
9. The sections reserved by the State
will'in time more than compensate for all
outlays and disbursements by the State.
In order to carry out this plan an appro
"prist ion by the Legislature Is requisite for
the purchase of laud, compensation of com
missioners, separate agent, etc., but which
will tend to the advancement and prosperi
ty of our beloved State, and prove a great
source of revenue in the not distant future.
Respectfully submitted by, yours truly,
Peter Staub.
Enoxyiixe, Nov. 30, 1872.
QCEsno.NSACocr ixsvnxncE.
The recent great files are bringing up again
all tbe old questions. A correspondent cf
the New York Journal of Commerce in
quirky; "If a firm has insurance on its
stock for $30,000, and all the stock Is worth
5100,00, and their s'-ocs ia damazed bv
ire to the extent of $50,000. how much In
surance can they collect? Do the Conipa
jtiiea piy the whole damage, or do they pay
in proportion of the whole stock to tbe
amount of insurance? that Is, will the
firm receive $50,000, or only $25,000?" In
reply the Journal 6tates that no matter
how much the stock is worth,
ir ine Insnranco is for $0'J,000 un
dei a plain ordinary policy, the underwrl
ter must pay any loss which occurs up to
that amount.
But if the policy contains what Is known
3 "the average clauEe," (which reads : "It
is understood and agreed that claims under
this policy shall only be for such proportion
of the whole loss as the amount of this al
lowance bears to Iho whole value of the
prorerty iusured,") then the loss falls pro
rata on tbe underwriter and the owner. If
the s ock Li insured hilf iu value, with this
clause inserted, the underwriter pays half
ine loss, it insured one-fourth the value,
th'yi he pays one-fourth the loss. But if
this clause Is omitted, then tba owner can
collect his entire loss, if enough has been
msuiea in solvent comDanies.
A Boston merchant hiving asked the
question: "Who is responsible for the loss
occasioned by the blowing up, with gun
powder, of the buildings in this city at the
late fire?" the reply is made that the loss is
precisely the same a3 if they had bfen
burned. If the buildings blown up were
zX such a distance from the fire that It is
doubtful if they would have burned, the
city may be Held, responsible. An Insur
ance cao 13 quoted from Wendell's re
ports showing that the loss of buildings
uuder such circumstances is loss by fire
within the meaning of the policy of insur
ance. Tins poet Campbell sajs that he once
heard a lady of distinguished beauty and
rank defend Sir Thomis Lawrence from
the charjre of having been culpable in pay
ing attention to ladies without intending to
follow mem up by an oiler oi nis nana. A
gentleman remarked that Sir Thomas wa
highly blamable. "No," replied the lady
(it was rumored she herself was once the
temporary oljcct of the great palmer's at
tentions), "no, not exactly not so much
to blame," eaid she mniingly. "What,"
oxcN'med the gftiitlcman, "you astonish
rue! Xot to blame for Mich conduct?" "No,
not so mucb," was still the musing re
sponse. "Can jou really, madam, defend
such behavior as desettion? "Why sir,"
interrupted the lady, "to confess the truth,
I am nrmly of opinion thit the majority of
the women would rather be courted and
jilled.than not be courted at all." Now, can
tbisrto so?
The Queen of England has reversed the
gallantry of Sir Walter Raleicb, who spread
his ilch plush coat out for his sovereign to
tread upon. The Duke cf Sutherland is
bavin a shaft sunk in his estate to improve
some mine;, and being told of these opera
tions while there, the Queen expressed a
desire to see them. Tbe Duke escorted her
thither, aud while her Majesty was standing
on the bank Inspecting the work, It com
menced to rain. A few yards off one of tba
men, named Cooper, was sawing timber for
the shaft, and heedless of the rain, con
tinued his wjrk without a coat. Presently
he was surprissd to feel a light touch, and
on looking up perceived the Duke, who
laid a costly rug over his shoulders, at the
emp Mine exclaiming, "The Qneen request
ed n. ' to present you with her own rug;
jou iasy keep it and wear it."
A FoHEiGif letter gives this description
ofKr-z Victor Emanuel: "His Majesty
was looking even more repulsively ugly
than usual, hlj head nearly disappearing
between his shoulders Inconsequence of bis
ibcif Ming bulk, and his complexion, always
darL, hiving become nearly black. His
aeck"iinow so short, from obesitv, that his
enormous mousiacLes rest on each shoul-de-,
sad a perpetual scowl clouds his face."

A Knval Debate.
Mr. Scofield, of Pennsylvania, from the
Committee on Naval Affairs, reported a bill
to authorize the construction of ten steam
vessels of "war and appropriating $3,000,000
for that purpose. I he vessels are to carry
each ten or more guns of large calibre, and
the hulls are to be either iron or wood, as
the Secretary of the Navy may determine.
Mr. Hall, of Maine, ouered an amend
mcnt that not less than live of tho ten Ves
sels shall be constructed in private yards in
the United States under coutracc.
Mr. Randall, of Pennsylvania, advocated
the amendment, but thought the bill too
loosely drawn and left too much discretion
to the secretary or the Navy.
Mr. scobeld, of Pennsylvania, replied to
Randill's s rictures, arguing that the more
restrictions were placed on the Secretary
the ltss security there would bo to have
the woik p".peily done.
Mr. Pouer, u iew iork, asked to what
use the vessels were to be applied,
Mr. scohbid replied they would be used
to keep our squadrons full ia different seas
aud for the j.rAeciioa of.commetce.
.Mr. Shellabaigtr, ol Uhio, gave it as his
judgment that a system ought to bo initiat

believed it wise to put upon the seas a class
of vessels that would have speed, have
size, aud havu adoptation for the protection
of commerce. He thought it wise to guard,
limit, specify, and qualify tho description of
ships to be built.
Mr. scoheld remarked that the ideas ex
pressed by the gentleman from OLio cor
responded with tho purpose of the com
mittee.
Mr. Cox of New York suggested a re
duction of the number of vessels from ten
to five.
Mr. Banks said that he had Introduced

Mr. Banks-denied that he had ever sym

1872 having repealed the act of 1S70, which
created a returning Board, there was no rc-I

In the case or Herron vs. barton, the
Court referred to the decision or the su
p reme Court lu the Bovee-Herron case, and
held that as Herron never had been S2cre-
tary of State, he could have no standing iu
the suit at the bar.
Upon the rendering of these decisions,
Mr. Mott, defedant's counsel made a mo
tion that the inunctions in both cases bo
dissolved and both suits be dismissed on
the ground that under the act of 1872, re
pealing the act of 1870 election law, there
was no returning board, and consequently
the parties to tbe snits were legally dead;
that iu the suit of Herron vs. Wharton, the
Supreme Court had declared not only that
Herron never was Secretary of State but
that Bovee was entitled to that office, and
therefore Herron as a claimant for the po
sition had ho standlug in the Court. The
injunctions were dissolved and the suits
dismissed.
The above is given in view of tho fact
that In the case of Kellogg vs Warniotb,
ono of the Important points sought by the
plalnrlffis to establish the returning" board,
consisting cf Herron, Lynch, Langstreet aud
Hawkins. Longstreet and Hawkins were
made members of the board by Herron's

Regarding tbe returning board, Mr. Bill
ings, plaintilPs counsel, in the argument to
day before Judge JJurell in the Kellogg-
Warmoth case, said: In case ot an aboli
tion of the canvassing board, it would de
volve upon the Senate to appoint
a new board, but there could
not be a Senate until. the
returning board had first canvassed the
ballots cast for candidates fof the Senate.
Hence he claimed that tbe theory advanced

A Day oi Sorrow.
The scene at the City Hall this morning
has had no parallel since the day the dead
body of Abraham Lincoln lay witmn l's
walb. The building itself ha 1 a sombre
and mournful app-jarance, with its uig3 a'
balf-mast. tho pillars enfolded in black
scive festoons, the sami material drooping
over the portico,and enframing thelwindjw.
Uoon the balcony, shrouded m mourning
emblems aud heavy folds of the United

ber with Prde HiBusy Life."
The body of the dead journalist arrived

and was ornamented with festoons of nat
ural fern leaves. At the head was a sec nd
inscription: "I know that my Redeemer
liveth" and yet another at tho foot worked
in violets, "fhe city mourns our loss."
Mr. Greeley lay with his leit arm lying
by his side and tha right across els breas
His fica was terribly emaciated and worn,
utterly unlike that which his daily compan
ions havo baen accustomed to see. His ap
pearance was that of a man who had afcer
terrible sufferings succumbed ina prolonged
fight with tho -combined forces of mental
and bodily anguish.
Although preparations for receiving the,
public were not completed until 10 o'clock,
as early as 8 tho square In front of tho City
Hall was occupied by thousands of men,
women and children, Intent upon taking a
farewell look at the face of the departed.
Everywhere the utmost decorum prevailed.
There was no jostling, no tumultuous haste,
to obtain advantageous positions. Auusn
p rvaded ihe entire assemblage, and each
faca wore a look of intense sadness. Tho
multitude was formed in line and pissed up
two by two into tho room where the boay
was lying in state. One oi the hrst men to
approach the coffin was Gen. John A. Dlx.

eldest friends of Mr. Greeley. The old man
sat near the head of tho body and seemed
pleased to be questioned concerning the
life and. character of the deceased. Ho said
he could not remember that Greeley erer
referred to any youthful amusement. They
had been young men together, and as such
were often In each other's company. Every
body said, Weed has hours of relaxation.
but Gre dey never played. ''I was as poor
as he and had the battle of life to fight
as he had, and yet 1 always
took relaxation. You see we were
of different temperaments. Looking
back over Greetey s lire i tnink ho showed
as much unselfish ambition as any man
that ever lived. His whole life was given
to opposing ii justice and oppression. His
character was perfectly pure, for ho had no
vices that I knew of, and I was most Inti
mate with him In all matters. He was
fearless In tho expression of his belief in
what was right. His whole aim was to do
good."
When Weed approached the casket he
leaned over the body and gazed long and
earnestly into the lace or nts former asso
ciate. He seemed deeply affected by the
scene, and after looking at the features for
some time, he leaned on the shoulder of a
friend and left the room.
As the multitude filed by with uncovered
heads, each was allowed sufficient time to
view the dead. Many showed a disposition
to lag behind despitethe whispered admoni
tion of gentlemen in charge that there was
no time to lose. There were many ladies
who showed signs of emotion, some stop
ping to kiss the forehead of tho deceased.
As the dinner hour of the working classes
approached, the crowd awaiting admittance
to the chamber of death became"en'ormous.
Laborers came down iu their working
clothes to get one last look at the foce of
their cheery old friend. Working girls of
all ages came from their factories and stores,
and they were very properly allowed to
pass on before the men. who were obliged
to stand In line and await their turn. A
passage was made in this way for all per
sons who were accompanied by ladies
Families evidently from the country came
together and the old folks could not res
train their tears as Ihey looked on the face
of the man who had ai it were lived In
their hearts for half a life time. It was
also a noticeable fact that many negroes,
both men and women, were in the line.
The stream of people anxious to gaze
upon the features of tbe dead continued
undiminished until 10 o'clock this evening
when the Governor's room and the city
hall were closed. Probably
Fnlly Fifty Tnonsand Persons
viewed the body, and many thousands did
not eveu reach the steps of the City Hall,
the line extending blocks away.
Messrs. J. B. Stewart and "Edward T.
Carpeme r were present as representatives
of the family of tbe deceased and'at their
reauest. It i said, ihssn P;!.lfliMn intend
to reqnestMr. Sinclair to allowthe body to
row, so that ladles and others who hive nof
been able to visit the City Hall to-day may
have &n opportunity of seeing the face of

Glowinc Tribnto of the Katlonal
Democratic Committee.
The National Democratic Committee
have issued tha following:
Headquarters National Democratic
Committee, New York, Dec. 3. The Dem
ocratic National Convention did, in July,
2, with a unanimity unprecedented in
the history of tbe party, nominate as their
candidate for the office of President ol the
United States, Horace Greeley, of New
York. Six States cast their electoral votes
for him at the late elections, and millions of
men m other States where we railed ot sue
cess, testined their appreciation of his
noble character and the great service he
bad rendered the country, by voting our
Electoral ticket. But Horace Greeley is
dead, and tha splendor of the political vic
tory achieved by his opponents is now di
minished by tbe sorrow which this. sad
event has cast upon the people whom he
loved, "and who regarded him as one of tho
best, truest and bravest or men. T ha les
sons of his pure and blameless life will long
remain impressed upou tbe age in whicn
he lived. Every beat of Lis great heart was
In sympathy, with humanity in its. broadest
rnrm. tie loved the uovernment, no
loved his fellow men, and tbe labors of his
whole Ilie were to elevate the cmdition or
mankind. No struggle for liberty, civil or
religious, was ever made on the surface of
the earth since his manhood began with
which he did not affectiouately sympathize,
aud to which he faded to give laitbful and
powerful aid. Every day cf his life aboun
ded with acts of kindness, of charity, of
forgiveness and of love. Not his stricken
family alone, but a s -ricken poople sorrow
for the loss wholly inscrutbable and almost
unparalleled.
