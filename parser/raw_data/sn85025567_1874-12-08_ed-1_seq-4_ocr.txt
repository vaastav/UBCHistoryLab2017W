TUESDAY, DEC. 8, 1874
—The recent elections in France
look as though France were to be per
manently a Republic at last.
—We give way this week to our
Friends who have a word to say to the
readers of THE ADVANCE. We believe
that the newspaper should be a medium
through which the people may talk and
that the editor should uot be expected
to do all the talking.
—The agricultural regions of Michi
gan are shown to be decreasing in pop
ulation. Diversified culture and more
careful tillage are recommended to check
this tendency to run down at the heel.
How long will it be before Minnesota
will need similar advise for a similar
reason.
—We are now endeavoring to put in
a new office of our own in order to re
duce expenses and to give our readers a
better paper for their money. Let
every man who wants abetter paper
see to it that his old subscription is re
newed and paid, and that his neighbors
subscribe.
Too MUCH HONOR.—Miss Susan B.
Anthony having lately been referred to
by an enthusiastic lady admirer as the
Moses of her sex, because she had
led the women forty years, modestly
arose to explain that the time had been
less.
Lo,'T the poor Indian has been
found by the United States' Supreme
Court to have no title in fee to his
lands, and that the land includes the
timber and the minerals Uncle Sam
owns the whole- All of which is a fine
thing for U. S., but hard on Lo,"
as well as upon any sharpers who have
got their title from the last named gen
tleman.
—Is there a more valuable present
that can be made to a friend or to one's
own family, than a paper which will
come laden with thoughts, knowledge,
and kind, loving words every week- of
the year, a constant reminder of the
donor? When selecting holiday pres
ents ponder this question, and send in
your subscription to THE GRANGE AD-
—We present our readers, on the in
side of our paper to-day, the President's
Message delivered in Washington to the
Forty-third Congress yesterday after
noon. This is what a little enterprise
and the telegraph can accomplish. Of
course we have not had time to make a
synopsis of, or to review the document,
and owing to the importance of the mat
ters discussed, we think a perusal of the
entire document will pay for the time it
takes.
—Our readers will please to take no
tice that this paper is furnished to sin
gle subscribers at $2.00 per year and to
clubs of ten or more at precisely $1.50
a year payable invariably in advance.
We cannot let clubs run a year or a
half a year or any longer than until the
first day of January, A. D. 18Y5, and
then take $1.50 or nothing. We must
have the cash on the nail for every sub
scriber any other course would be bank
ruptcy to us and we do not propose to
bankrupt. It is not in our line. Send
in the cash then at once, and direct to
the GRANGE ADVANCE, Red Wing
Minnesota.
WMft.ROSS.
The Great Temperance Lecturer in
This flty.
Dr. Ross made his first appearance in
this place at the Methodist Church last Sun
day morning, when he delivered to a large
audience a most powerful and impressive
sermon upon the subject of God's Judgment
of the Nation of Antiquity.
In the afternoon the Doctor talked tojm.
immense concourse of children at Music
Hall in an inimitable manner, to the great
delight, and let us hope, benefit of the
youngsters.
On Sunday evening he lectured in Music
Hall to a grand audience, every seat being
occupied to its fullest capacity, and large
numbers being obliged to stand up. Hun
dreds of people were unable to obtain even
comfortable standing room andleft the Hall.
The interest did not abate at any time dur
ing the evening, and the immense assem
blage remained to the close, giving the
strictest attention.
He announced as his subject for the
evening the most difficult of all temper'*
ance themes, "The Bible Wine Question
and the Savior's Wine Miracle."
He began by explaining in a lucid style
the numerous derivations and meanings of
the word wine" as it occurs in the Bible.
According to Boss the good book couples it
with bread, milk and oil, and Jesus Christ
associates it with those articles of food in
every instance when he speaks favorably of
it. The Latin, Greek and Hebrew words,
all having a different shade of meaning,
are translated into English in King James'
version of the Bible by the one word
wine." In a sound, sensible and exhaus
tive argument, he proved that "wine,"where
it occurred in the original word of God in
a favorable sense, meant juice of fruit, and
when it was used in a disparaging or dam
natory sense, was another word with an en
tirely different meaning. He also showed
that alcohol was not a constituent of the
grape or marketable grain, but was pro
duced from them by distillation after they
had decomposed.
The latter part of the discourse was de
voted to the Savior's wine miracle. He
showed that the wine made by Christ at the
marriage feast of Cana of Galilee, was not
like the vile fermented stuff sold in this
country, but was new wine made after be
ing drawn out and resulted in pure grape
juice.
He quoted some of the most familiar
passages of Se: ipture pertinent to the sub
ject, and particularly those generally
thrown in the teeth of Christians by scof
fers, explaining them most effectually. He
ended by making the flat-footed assertion
that there is not a single text in the Holy
Bible relative to the wine question that does
not emphatically pronounce against the use
of intoxicating liquor as a beverage.
P. of H.
—The Secretaries of the State Granges
are to be in session at Washington, D.
C, to-morrow.
—The Kansas State Business Agent
is ordered by the Executive Committee
to meet with the Granges of the differ
ent counties to arrange for co-operative
work.
—Officers of the Grange are advised
by the Hoosier Patron to commit to
memory their respective parts of the
ceremony of initiation. It is good ad
vice.
—Too much jealousy and too little
charity is what ails too many of our
Granges.
E STATE GRANGE.—Before anoth-
er issue of the ADVANCE shall reach
our readers the State Grange will be in
session at Mankato. The business com-
ing before the Grange will be of vital
importance, and the utmost harmony
should prevail. We have admitted free
criticism of the officers of the Grange
to our correspondents but have refrain-
ed from any criticism on our own part.
We believe in a free expression of opin
ion, and think that it is much better
that persons who think or are convinced
that they have discovered wrong, should
openly state their minds, and give an
opportunity for explanation, if explana-
tion is possible, than that they should
either conceal wrong, or should secretly
foster and spread accusations without
the knowledge of the person attacked,
until the distrust has become so wide-
spread as to make it impossible to coun-
teract. Now we have no doubt but that
grave mistakes have, and probably
errors committed, yet no one should be
too hasty in their judgments, and above
all things no one should go to the State
Grange with bitterness in his heart, or
with any other desire than that of pro-
moting the best interests of the Order
and of every member thereof. It must
be remembered that while there have
been mistakes and errors, there have
also been sacrifices, and those who have
not been in the wrong are not to be in-
discriminately classed with those who
have either knowingly or unwittingly
erred. Let all things be done in a
spirit of brotherly love and kindness.
