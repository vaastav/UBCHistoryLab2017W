THURSDAY, DECEMBER 12, 18S9.
Maiione is one of the deadest ducks
of the year.
Manhattan is having an electric
light muddle too.
Resub3iission is so dead that talk
about it is almost a chestnut.
Congressman Harrison Ejxley
has been placed on the committee on
accounts.
These be panicky times. Half
the papers in the state are clawing at
the other half.
And Emin Pasha is to die after all.
The world's stock of noted men seems
to be decreasing.
Xoav that Jeff is dead will the Junc
tion City Tribune give up calling it
"Davis county?"
The democratic papers are not
pleased with Mr. Harrison's message.
That means it is a good one.
"Those who have steers to shed pre
pare to shed them now," is the classic
agricultural advice of an exchange.
TnE Hutchinson Xews has a column
headed "Kansas Klatter." There
seems to be something loose about it.
TorEKA is thirty-five years old and
still growing older. She is a frisky and
and vivacious creature nevertheless.
Congress should mean business
from the word go. It is business and
not monkey-work that the people look
for and desire at present.
The fact that the Roman number of
the present congress is LI does not
necessarily indicate that the members
will not stick to the truth.
The Wichita Joural says we have
"the pouts." That is a mean word to
be fling at a fellow just because he
criticised the Journal a little.
The McPherson Republican says that
$300,000 have been paid out in that
county this year for broom corn. One
dealer alone paid out $105,000 for this
product.
The defaulting cashier of the house
of representatives was a remnant of
the old democratic administration. Too
bad that all the rascals were not turned
out sooner.
The central figure in the south's list
of noted men has passed away. Jeff
Davis was a man of great energy, great
organizing power but he used them in
a wrong.cause.
We wonder if a prominent attorney
of the city does not feel that be has
gone a good deal out of his way to make
a very small exhibition of himself in
this week's Chronicle.
Senator Vest allows no dress suits
at his suppers. He is probably making
a bid for the vote of the backwoods
grangers of Missouri who dressin jeans
pants nd cotton shirts.
Senator Ingadls has been re-elected
vice-president pro tern, that is, he
will take Mr. Morton's place when that
gentleman is absent. It is going to be
pretty hard to down a man with a grip
like that.
The last of the four men who in
186-1 were of national prominence on
the national tickets has just died. They
were Abraham Lincoln, Geo.B.McClel
lan, Andrew Johnson aDd Geo. H.
Pendleton.
Talmage is following up Paul's
journeys. It is hardly likely that his
sermons on the way will be as long re
membered as the Apostle's, but he is
having more fun and making more
money on the trip.
The amount offered by the govern
ment for the alleged Indian title to the
Cherokee Strip is S7,113.S46, which
would yield, at 5 percent, interest, over
$350,000 a year. If the red-skins are
wise, they'll take it.
The Paisons Eclipse is the newest
daily paper of the metropolis of the
southeast. With three dailies Parsons
ought to survive the winter. The
Eclipse starts in bright enough to sur
vive its competitors at least. ,
Fire-proof and time-proof books,
with leaves and covers of sheets of
asbestos and printing in gold or silver
letters, hayj been suggested. In this
way, and this way only, can some
authors' works become indestructible.
Some enlightened individual pre
sented the pupils of the deaf and dumb
institution atrOlathe with a jewsharp
last week and the Star wickedly sug
gests that it-will now be in- order for
some one to give the inmates of the
blind asylum a spy-glass.
While Sam Jones was preaching in
Kentucky on bringing up children an
old blue-grass fellow said: " We raise
horses and bring up children." "Yes,"
retorted Sam, "you raise horses worth
$50,000 apiece and bring up children
worth about $3 a head."
The old soldiers are getting their
first remittances from the new pension
agenf, 'Kelly:' It is not likely that Mip
money will g- any further than wli-ii
Glick signed the checks, but it doubt
less seems better to the pensioners.
Martin of Salina thought himself
the finest reader in America but the
house of representatives bounced him
after one day of his Salina brogue. The
mere fact thafa man comes from Sa
lina works against him everywhere.
The Wichita Journal puts the word
Journal in small caps when it occurs
in the congressional proceedings. This
is as bad as the Xew York Herald
which once printed the- famous hymn
as "Hark, The Herald angels sing."
Western Kansas is said to be going
into the winter in excellent shape.
There has an abundance of rain fallen
and the wheat will be better prepared
for the cold weather than ever before.
If the year is prosperous the western
part of the state will come to the front
again.
Senator Pdumb yesterday intro
duced bills in the senate to erect pub
lic buildings; one at Emporia, Kas., to
cost $100,000; at Kansas City, Kas., to
cost $200,000, and at Salina, Kas., to
cost $150,000. Mr. Plumb, Abilene is
to be the future capital of Kansas. Be
ware how you slight her.
Indications point to the fact that
Henry M. Stanley will eat English roast
beef and plum pudding in London at
Christmas. And if his welcome is not
sufficiently enthusiastic in that conser
vative old town let him take the City
of Paris for ew York, and Americans
will see what they can do on New
Year's day
Did the State Journal have the Dick
inson County News in its mind's eye
when it said yesterday: A worse
plague than the old saloon is the small
resubmission democratic paper that
afflicts many Kansas towns. Its effect
on the community is something like
that of a leaky sanitary wagon. It only
succeeds in polluting the atmosphere.
Here are a few dates of interest:
1776 The United States of America.
1824 The United States of Mexico.
1S61 The United States of Columbia.
1S61 The United States of Venezuela.
1889 The United States of Brazil.
Will there ever be the United States of
North and South America, and how
soon? Ex.
It is said that Mr. Cleveland nowa
days moves at a slow and ponderous
gait, and seldom smiles. Even at a
theater the expression of his face is
habitually solemn and morose, though
the play may be shriekingly funny.
Grover is painfully aware thathis goose
as a public man is forever cooked and
the white house has taken its place in
the past forever.
A large amount of gush is being
wasted over the fate of Igoe, the asso
ciated press reporter lost in the Trib
une fire at Minneapolis. As a matter
of fact he seems to have stayed at his
wire to send an unimportant message
when he was told to escape. He fell,
the victim of his own delay. He helped
nobody by staying, and butfor the fact
that he is dead would be severely cen
sured. Blatherskite Claiborne in his
pretended reply to the Reflector
fails to deny the charge that he
"was a rebel all through the war and
never voted the republican ticket until
he came to Abilene and theu did so for
boodle." In fact, he couldn't after
telling the facts about town and then
begging his hearers "not to tell' it, asit
would hurt him in pulling the wool over
the eyes of the republicans."
The Wichita Journal would like
some one of the brilliant brains of Kan
sas to give us new expressions for the
following which have grown threadbare
and chestnutty: "Alone with his God
and a lead pencil," "Dull thud,"
"Chestnuts," "O, mamma," "Atrench-
ant pen," "Lurid flames," "Conven
tional black," "(Hie)," "Ye Editor,"
"Rats," "The blushing bride," "It's a
boy," "Parts his name in the middle,"
"Pants," "What's in a name," "Pro
hibition cranks," "Whisky soaks,"
"W," "Napoleon of Finance," "e. c,"
"Where did yu get that hat," "In the
soup."
When the south has enjoyed a free
ballot and a fair count of it for a short
term of years it will wonder at the
patience with which it endured a long
reign of oligarchs who ruled by fraud
and force. There are thousands of im
migrants and millions of money wait
ing to enter the southern tier; their
advent is delayed solely by the absence
of respect for law and the paucity of
free schools. The negro question will
subside as soon as white immigrants
reduce the relative numerical force of
the colored people and new capital
establishes new industries which will
create new issues upon which both the
colored and the white voters willdivide
in the south, as they now divide in the
nor tli,
A democrat can get a great deal of
consolation out of very small favors.
The republican caucus named a chap
lain for the house of representatives.
Upon the final vote iu the house a
number of the republican members
voted for Mr. Milburn, who was the
former chaplain and a blind' man.
Doubtless their votes were cast out of
sympathy for the man's misfortune.
The office is in no sense a political one,
and has never been so regarded. But
the poor, defeated democracy claims
this act of charity as a democratic victory.
The politicians who are advocating
a constitutional convention ought to
tell us just what part of the state con
stitution they would change, leave out
or add to. It is easy enough for a man
who would like to be a delegate to a
state constitutional convention to say
he favors a new constitution, but the
reasons for a change are what the
voters would like to hear. The adop
tion of a new constitution would cost
the state a half million dollars. There
must be some pressing need for this
lirge expenditure of money before the
people will authorize it. Be explicit,
gentlemen, and tell us just what you
want to put in or leave out of your new
constitution. If the change promises
to be worth its cost, it may be made,
otherwise the people will manage to
jog along under our present laws.
The average review of a president's
message is a delusion and a snare.
The document is too long for a detailed
criticism and only the chief points can
be touched upon, and those only in the
briefest manner. President Harrison's
message is being received by the press
of the country with general satisfac
tion. It is a careful, conservative yet
able exposition of republicanism and
its present plans for the upbuilding of
the nation. It impresses the reader as
the work of a thoughtful, business-like
3tudent of public affairs and one who
has only the United States' best inter
ests at heart. Its suggestions
are all in the line of progress, and if
they can be followed by congress most
benificent results will come. There
are no individual, pig-headed eccentric
ities such as made Cleveland famous
all recommendations appeal directly to
the good judgment of thinking citizens.
The South. American Trade.
The proceedings of the Pan-American
congress-, have impelled a democratic
exchange to turn loose its dogs of war
on the great bugaboo of the democracy,
"the robber, tariff," and declare with
all the solemnity of a brainless owl that
we are losing a large amount of South
American trade because South Ameri
can products are shut out of our mar
kets by the tariff on imports.
The well-informed free traders will
feel very badly,indeed,when these "out
rageous arrows" strike them. If there
be one argument stronger than another
against the "reciprocal distribution"
theory of the free traders, it is found in
the conditions of free trade between
the United States and the states of
South and Central America. We buy
more from them and sell less to them
than England does. According to the
"reciprocal distribution" theory "we
ought to sell more because we buy
more.
That a large number of South
American products are shut out of our
market by the tariff is a false assump
tion. The exchange referred to has
picked up a piece of clay and mistaken
it for a flint stone. The truth is that a
larger quantity of South American
products comes into our market than
info the markets of any other country
of the world. Nor does our tariff
either exclude or limit importation; it
is inoperative so far as the chief prod-
I' ucts of the Southern and Central Amer
ican states are concerned. What are the
chief products? Coffee, India rubber,
guano, hides, hoops, horns and other
glue materials, cocoa, arrow root, cin
namon bark, mahogany, rosewood,
;satinwood, ebony and "all cabinet
woods;" every one of which is duty free
by the tariff now in force. Our con
temporary deals a fierce blow upon its
free-trade friends when it charges limi
tation of trade with South America to
the operation of the tariff. We sell
far more to England, most of whose
.important products we tax, than to
South America, whose principal pro
ducts we admit duty free,
i We do not get our share of the trade
;ivith Southern and Central America be
;jaase, aud solely because, England pro
jects her ships by bounties and subsi
dies, while we have drifted into the
jfree-trade policy of witholding subsi
dies. English ships are found in the
ports and harbors of Southern and Cen
tral America, and United States ships
are not. Now ships create trade, just
as railways do. Tho perfection of the
plan of protection to American indus
tries includes such liberal ship subsi
dies as England gives; when that stage
of perfection is reached the .balance of
trade will be in our favor. Not till
then.
Gray and dry hair will become dark
and moist by the use of Hall's HairBe-newer.

In several instances it has been diffi
cult to state precisely tho occupations
of the signers. Tako the case ot
Samuel Adams. Ife studied for the
ministry, was a merchant, and became
the ablest writer of his time on publio
questions. The word "farmer" is used
In several places where landed pro
prietor or planter would be more fit.
One case, a signer Roger Sherman, of
Connectictft was a shoemaker until ho
was twenty-one years old, and then for
sook the bench for tho bar. It is diffi
cult to determine just what profession
to honor with the name of Richard
Henry Lee. Charles Carroll, of Carroll
ton, considered the wealthiest man in
the colonies, was a lawyer by profession.
In regard to the nativities of the signers
it will be understood that, while many
were natives of America, their fathers
were of European birth. For example,
William Hooper, of North Carolina, was
born in Boston, and his father was a
Scotchman, and the father of George
Read 'Wis an Irishman. So far as pos
sible the biographies have been care
fully consulted, and the table given is
believed to be substantially accurate.
Chicago Inter Ocean.
SUCCESS IN LITERATURE.
Books That Came Into Vigorous lleing Al
most bjr Chance.
There have been cases in which liter
ary renown has been won unawares. In
affirming this such instances as tiioso of
Mrs. Harriet Heecher Stowe's "Uncle
Tom's Cabin," Mr. lllack's "Daughter of
Heth,' and Rider Haggard's "King Sol
omon's Mines, " examples of astonishing
success achieved at a stroke, are not in
mind,.but Sir Walter iscott kept "Wa
verly" by him in manuscript nino years,
fearingjhat by its publication it might
put in peril the reputation which, was
already"bis nl virtue of hfs poems.
It is most unlikely ffiat Master Sam-
U-or.Ppy-dreamed of ho:immor
his "Diary" was to gtve him. Miss Fer
rier, the writer of the striking -stprieSj.
"The Inheritance" and "Destiny'" has
herself stated that hor first work was
"begun at the urgent desire of a friend,
and with a promise of assistance, which,
however, failed long before the end of
the first volume. The work was thrown
aside, and resumed some years later. It
afforded occupation and amusement for
idle and solitary hours and was pub
lished in the belief that tho author's
name would never be guessed at or tho
work heard of beyond a very limited
sphere." As a final and recent instance,
Prof. Henry Drummond and his -widely-circulated
"Natural Law in the Spiritual
"World"' may be quoted. The professor
has told his readers that that fascinat
ing book "was never formally written.
It came into being almost by chance."
Quiver.
A Moose in the Pantry.
A certain .old man used to say to his
granddaug&ter-when she was out of tem
per or naughty in any way: "Mary,
Mary, take care, there's a mouse in the
pantry!" She would often cease crying
at this, and stand wondering to herself
what he meant, and then run to the pan
try to see if there really was a mouse in
the trap; but she never found one. One
day she said: "Grandfather, I don't
know what you mean; I haven't a pantry,
and there are no mice in mother's, be
cause I have looked so often." He
smiled and said: "Come, and I'll tell you
what I mean. Your heart, Mary, is the
pantry; the little sins are the mice that
get in and nibble away at the good, and
that makes you sometimes cross and
peevish and fretful. To keep them out
you must set a trap the trap of watch
fulness." United Presbyterian.
Darius Cook, of Iowa, being down in
Alabama, inquired at the post-office for
a letter and was so pleased because he
got one that he presented the postmaster
with a diamond pin. Every Alabama
postmaster is now on the hustle when
Iiiger calls for malL-Detro e.
