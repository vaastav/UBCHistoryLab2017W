A Modern Typewriter.
Now-n-days wo demand modern
things. Our "reat-grandfathor.s
used quill pons. They wore the best
writing implements then. Few
writers use them now. They are
out-of-date.
To-day a Typewriter is the most
important adjunct in an ofiico equip
ment. There isnoquestion about it.
They save time, do the work of
soveral peoplo.
The Peerless Typewriter
stands out prominently as a modern,
up-to-date machine. Tt combines all
the good points of any machine on
the market, while it has none of the
dofeots found in other makes.
T. W. IIOBRON,
Honolulu, General Agent.
SAX FRANCISCO, Dee. 8. The chief
interest In President Cleveland's final
message to Congress centers in his
treatment of the Cuban question. To
tills subject he devotes a much longer
chapter than he did iu Ills previous
deliverance and develops a plan of
emllng the war through the mediation
of the United States. Spain to grant j
the Cubans autonomy and this Go-
eminent to guarantee that the terms ,
of the compact will he kept. It is ad-
mitted that Spam has made no defi
nite reply to the proposal, now sev
eral months old, to bring this arrang'
mcnt about though the public will
readily recall the sneer of Senor Ca i
ovas at the idea of "a nation of shop
keepers guaranteeing the word of
Spain" whereupon the President
gives warning that this Government
cannot Indefinitely hold an "expectant
attitude." In other words Spain must
terminate the war in some way before.
It becomes a useless sacrifice of human
life, or the United States will feel
called upon to intervene.
While the terms of the message give
the Cubans no reason to hope that
they will be granted belligerent rights,
its general effect must be to strength
en them in the spirit of prolonged re
sistance. They know, of course, that
Cleveland cannot fix the policy of the
Government after the 1th of .March,
but it is a fair inference that if he
would lay down a policy of even re
mote intervention, his Republican suc
cessor, coming in to office on a pro-
Cuban platform, would be likely to
make Spain's time limit ery short. It
must likewise be admitted that Spain's
energies will also find a new stimulus
iu the danger thus made threatening,
and that the winter' will witness the
most strenuous campaigns which any
war in Cuba has yet seen.
The President gives a short 'para
graph to the Venezuela settlement, to
which he expects the assent of the
Caracas Government, and brings out
the important fact that a general ar
bitration treaty between Great ltritain
and the United States is likely to be
concluded at an early date. The only
other significant matters touched up
on in the field of foreign relations are
the Armenian atrocities, in dealing
with which the President feels that
the initiative must come from the
great powers, "which assert their ex
clusive right to intervene In their own
time and method for the security of
life and property in Turkey."
I'pou domestic subjects the Presi
dent dwells at great length. He docs
not believe that Japanese immigration
gives ground as yet for alarm or dis
trust. He would equip the militia
with improved arms. In the matter of
coast defense he urges that the gen
eral plan be followed out, ami believes
that the cost of the remaining work
will lie less than the original estiina'e.
The deficit in the postal revenues the
President would have made up by in
creasing the postage on much matte'.'
which is not rated as second class.
Speed premiums for warships have
been abolished. Touching recommend
ations for the further increase of th
Navy the Executive makes none, but
congratulates the country that our
naval shipbuilding facilities are now
equal to any demands likely iO be
made iixti them.
As to the Pacific railroad debts, the
message goes into minute detail as t
their nature and origin, and declares
that unless Congress shall take -ou:r
specific action in the premises, the
Government will foreclose its leins,.
In conclusion, President Cleveland
asks for a longer trial of the Gorman
Wilson tariff for reasons that need fo
be considered more at length than is
practicable in this summary, and up li
the question of currency reform gives
It as his opinion that we can huv no
financial peace and safety until the
Government currency obligations upon
which gold may be demanded from the
Treasury are withdrawn from circula
tion and canceled.
As a whole, the message is perhaps
less commonplace than those which
have previously, during the present
term, borne the .Cleveland signature.
Hut it is doubtful if it will either add
to or detract from the reputation
which its author has already made In
the production of state papers.
Hawaii is no mentioned in the message.

On her arrival J.ijhloknlani sent u

presence was desirable. He went down
anil escorted tiie ex-Queen to the Cal

With respect to her mission to the

saying: "She will certainly visit

poses. In a few days, the ijuceit tells
me, she will make a statement of her
plans to the public."
