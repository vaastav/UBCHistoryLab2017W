One of thu questions which occupied tlio
public mind prior to tho November elec
tions, and one, too, which greatly contrib
uted to tho republican defeat, was that of
thu "third term." It being understood
that tho President had no very Insurmount
able objections to n re-election, there has
been, naturally, an urgent desire to learn
his exact views upon this subject direct
from his own lips or under his nfllclal slg
untuie, and tho first Monday in December
and his message were the proper time and
place to communicate them. Ills words
arc now written, ''oh that they were
printed In n book I That they wcie graven
with an Iron pen and lead In tho rock," or,
as was dona with Arabic legends, that they
wcro wi Men In letters of gold. Ills em
phatic language on tho subject will, It is
trusted, set the m itter nt rest forever.
They aro worthy of lepctltlon, and wo give
them as contained in his annual message
Id ("ingress, Monday. Here they me: "
soiTiinit.-v irvTi.ii i d.vtiox
While we believe that the country will
be in substantial accord wllh the tone of
the President's mcssaini as a whole, while
many will experience n pleasurable feeling
of disappointment thcrcat,but wo know not
why they should nnd while wo fall to fee
any use In tho "Institution," we do not li'.e
tho toni' of the President In lioatlngnf
southern affairs. Theie an- come good
points ali ut it, but lie takes it too much
for granted that every wiong there com
mitted Is the act of while men. He seems
not to h vo learned tlm ilio "outrage busi
ness" w..s played out r "d that thu country
will pay no heed to"ieli reports unless lliey
an' well (I lined, h '.pen sometime except
j .t lif'foi- clceli..n, are sustained by cred
ible prn.il nnd followed by prompt
trial and speedy rotiviction. He grave
ly tells us Out "with the preparations
"for the late flection, decided
"indications appeared in some localities in
"Ihe southern slates of a determination by
"acts of violence and Intimidation to deprive
' 'citizens of the freedom of ballot, because of
"their political opinions. Hands of men,
masked and armed made their appearance
"while leagues and other societies wcro
"formed j large quantities of arms and
"ammunition were Imported nnd distributed
"to these organizations. Military drills,
"with menacing demonstrations were held,
"nnd with nil these murders enough wcro
"committed to spread terror among those
"whoso political action was to be suppressed
"if possible by these intolerant nndcriminal
"proceedings.
Now this statement in cither true or
falsu iu fact we assume that the President
believes it. If true, it 13 susceptible of
proof. If false, it may or may not be
shown. Wo do not propose to consider
this particular branch of thu suhji ct at
length. That lias already been done in
connection with these reported "outrages"
as detailed from many a "stump"' nnd
"organ" prior to election. Hut If Ihls
statement U true what wcie tho four
thousand and odd United Slates soldiers
doing in the south that they did not cap
ture some of these "while leaguers," aimed
men with or without masks, members of
"oilier socictlea" and other outragcrs ?
Why wcie not some of tho "large quanti
ties of arms and ammunition" seized nud n
stop put to some of the "menacing demon
strations"? Why did they not arrest some
of those murderers, whose nets "spread
terror"? Tho administration was in tho
"Inteilcring" business about that time, nnd
elaimcj, right or wrong, full power to do
nil these things. Hut they have failed to
do any ono of these things. Why ? Let
tho Piesidcnt iutorm Congress. We aro
aware that certain arrests were made by
deputy United States marshals, but it was
simply the playing of a farce as they were
discharged ns soon as they appeared in
court United States courts too, not state
courts. In our judgment tho President
committed a grave breach of propriety in
trumpeting to the world as solemn facts
occurrences which, at best, rest upon un
cei tain rumor or tho reports of interested
politicians It is ot a piece with the Infor
mation that the negro has no triends savo
in tho icpublican partya statement ie.
quiring no comment aud one which, if
tiue, is unworthy ot a president of tho
whole country not of a political party.
The sentence from which wc have quoted
concludes as follows: " In some places
ciiloicd laborers were compelled to vote ac
cording to tho wishes of their cmploycis,
under threats of dischargu if they acted
iilherw isc, nnd there mo too many instances
in which, when these threats wcie disre
garded, llity were remorselessly executed
hy tliuso who made them." Tills statement
may he hue In fact ; indeed, we believe It
to bo true, but is theie any remedy there-
for? Is the south alone guilty of such
nets? I.ei tho south stand or fall by Its
own distinctive, acts, but let It not be held
up as an object of lcproach, or used as n
icasoti for "' executive interference in tho
nffalis of a state," when tho noith lias been
nnd Is still disgraced by similar practices,
W should as coon vote nt t lie dlctatiou
of one man as many of us have ut lliu die.
tiition of caucuses composed of less than u
score ot men, but let us take this voting at
1 lie dictation of cmploycis, und how docs it
stand ut the north? Wo have personally
seen troops of operatives marched up to tho
polls, hi Massachusetts, receive their votes
fiom their employer or overseer, and de
posit tho &.imo without ever knowing for
whom they wcio voting. Tills was accom
plished nt tho dictation of tho employer,
contrary to the known political pilnciples
of tlie operatives, enfoiced by thiealB of
discliargo nnd " when theso threats wero
" dlsregaided, tlity wcro remorselessly exc
" cutcd by those who made them." The
making nud enfoicenicnt of these threats
omlhrow Iho Whig parly in Mas
sachusetts and Inaugurated the " secict
ballot," now, wo believe, unfor
tunatcly for operatives, no lengcr In
force. Tho samo system of threats and
"remoiselcss execution" is practiced In
Rhode Wand, Connecticut, New Yoik aud
elsewhere. It has been chargtd, and thcro
Is too much reason to bcllevo tho charge
true, that such a custom, also, prevails, or
has prevailed, In Yeimont. We have per
sonally seen In Michigan, tho deaf, dumb
and blind marched by tho dozens In differ
ent squids, to tho polls and voting at the
dictation of the state superintendent of the
asylum, without Knowing tho contents of
their ballot until after It was beyond their
control, If they ever knew for whom they
voted. We havc,moi cover, n direct knowl
edge ot Iho manner iu which these blind
and mutes were induced to vote, nnd there
was not a particle of "frco will" about It.
We might", also, Inquire wheiclu Is tho dif
ference of the case stated by tho president
and that of compelling government clerks
to contiibute of their scanty salaries for
election purposes, or of packing caucuses
and election dlstilcls with government em-
ployes, in order to nominate or elect n par-
. .... .... - ... I
ticular candidate without reierence to tlie
Individual opinion of the employe and lib
attendance being piocurcd or enforced by
tho suggestive argument, tho Implied
threat contained tho words "bread and but
ter." We utterly condemn these and simi
lar pracllcci wherever they prevail ; but
we, before joining In condemning tho
south Ihcrcfor making It nn excuse lor
"executive Interference," desire to see tho
skirts of the north ficc from similar stains.
Let him who Is without tin cast tho Hist
stoue, and that Is not the north or tho re
publican pany. v o do not mean to say
that the democracy, modern or Bouibon,
is without fin in tills matter, because they
are not, but It ill becomes us to cast stones
at cither them nr the south under existing
circumsliinccs.

Tho President's message, "dellvcicd" to
tho two houses of Cungicss, Mond.iy, has
been telegraphed llunitghnut the length nnd
breadth of tho land, lias been published In
most of (lie dally newspapers of the coun
try, has been generally read, considered
and discussed by the people, mid will now
take Its place among tho Eo-called "state
papers" of the republic. That thu people
generally, of bolh political paitics, have
anxiously wailed for Us appearance and
cagcily lead ils contents is an undoubted
fact, hut why they should have watched
and waited in such nuxtous expectancy
passes our coinpichcnsloii to conceive. It
is easily undeistooil why thcro is so much
solicitude to obtain tlie views of n newly
elected President, upon the assumption of
the reins of government by a political party
which has long been In a minoiity and in
opposition in previous administrations, as,
also, to scan with eagerness the first an
nual message of such n Piesidcnt. Sucli
occasions are familiar to us nil in the case
of President Lincoln's (list Inaugural nnd
special and annual messages to Congress.
The country w as then in a state of turmoil,
states had "seceded," were "seceding" or
llircateniLg to "secede."--m It was termed
fri m tho Union, nnd it was of tho utmost
importance that tho sentiments of the in
coming administration should be distinctly
stated, that its pulley should bo cleaily an
nounced, as it was believed that the per
petuity of the Union depended chiefly upon
such utterances. That inaugural was tem
perate, but firm. Ils effect, however, on
tlie south wns anything but conciliatory,
demonstrating that tho words of n Presi
dent arc little woith when they fall upon
the eaia of an excited people bent upon n
given course. W lien the same President
was about to pronounce Ills second inau
gural address, tlie same fcveiish anxiety to
learn its contents pervaded the public mind,
because a distinctive war or peace policy
was expected to bo announced. This
anxiety nnd expectation was doomed to a
bitter disappointment. The inaugural dealt
only in generalities, which, however, be
came almost n ohciishcil lienlagc to the
American people in view of the speedy
tragic death of its author.
Perhaps In President Omul's case, llieic
was a hope that in view of tho recent elec
tions he would have tome new policy to
announce ; but, if so, the hope must have
been dim indeed und the character of the
mau, the " great silent man," must have
been forgotten. There is much in tho mes
sage that we most heartily appiove, but.iu
all seriousness nnd with no intent of un
friendly criticism, we ask is there anything
new m it ? The main lads have already
been presented to the public by the press,
and many of tlicm have become old. The
financial question is well stated, the views
aie of the soundest soit anil will be hailed
with joy by all hatcr3 of every form of re
pudiation nnd by every lover of a sound
currency based on specie but how, know.
ing the man, could any one look for other
utterances ? Is there anything new in this
sixth or seventh repetition of tho Picsi
dent's sentiments relative to nidation and a
return to specie payments? It is tlie same
policy which he has always advocated,
only, perhaps, staled in diffeient words.
Did any one suppose that the triumph of
western and southern inflationists could
change General Grant's opinion upon tlie
subject? If so, that one lias failed to
comprehend the uatuie of the Piesidcnt of
the United Stalls. So we may run through
with tho different subjects of the messago
foreign relations, Alabama claims, claims
against Mexico, repoi Is of the several de
partments, etc. and where Ihe message
contains statement of laet or cxpiession of
opiulon, it gives us nothing now, Imt every
thing old with two exceptions.
We have, wo believe we do not say It
positively never before had the president's
opinion relative to "Chinese women," and
he now takes occasion to state, for tho
benefit of the anti-Chinese clement of the
Pacific coast, that "they aie brought for
shameful pu: poses, to Iho disgrace of tho
communities wlieiu lliey are setlleil and to
tho great demoralization of the youth of
those localities." The parents and friends
ot llicso "youth," so subject to "demorall
zatlon," havo our heartiest sympathy, but,
as the president makes no lecommendalion
upon tho subject, we aie hound lo believe
that he knows of no legislative power, on
tho pint of tho general government to rem
edy, prevent or icgulato tlie evil. If tlie
United States Is lo bo an asylum for thoso
desiring lo Immigrate hither fiom all
counti lcs.lt surely cannot ho expected
that congress will lcglslato to pievent Chi
ncse Immigration nuy mow lliau Gciman,
French, English, Iiish in Russian. It
strikes us, too, as n rather bold assumption
to hold up nil tho Chinese women as ob
jects ot scorn, iu lacl as nothing but pros
titutcs. Moreover If the general gniem
inent can legislate upon the subject, it np
pears to r.s that it is n pioper subject for
police lcgulation nnd, if bo, it may and
should properly bo left lo 6tato and muni
clpal control nnd lcgulation. Wo havo al
leady had too much Inteifeienco on the
part of tho general government In stuto uf.
fairs, without having congress lcglslato rel
ative to tho "social evil" m the mining dii
trlcts and tho states west of tho Itoclcy
mountains. Wo aie not finding fault with
tho president or his messago wo havo ser
ious fault with ono part of It which ws
shall consider Iu another article but wo
must aik, If our- views nre correct, why
docs tho president Introduce tho topic f Is
It for Luncomo or for Its freshness ?
Thcro Is another paragraph In tho mes
sage which meets our hearty approval nnd
merits nnd will rccclvo that of the Ameri
can people. It is truo that It state noth
ing new, when we consider tho sentiments
of tho country nud the history of former
administrations, but It is a new nnd some
what startling expression of opinion on the
part of the present administration unless,
nerchaoce. ono may consider it as an
enlargement of the i'reslilcnt a reputed re
mark that "ho had enough southern gover-
nn Ida l.nnilj " TTn fldVA f TllP vlin1f
nors on his hands." lie says i "The whole
" lubject of exccutlyo Interference with
" tho'affalrs of a stato Is repugnant to pub-
" lie opinion, to the feeling.? of thoso who
" from their official capacity must be used
" In such Interposition, nnd to lilm or
" those who must direct. Unless most
" cleaily on the side of law, such Interfer
" cuce becomes n crime." True, oh Mr.
Piesidcnt nnd we thank jnu for tho tardy
expression of opinion, but why, pray In
form the people, have not the administra
tion so acted? If such u disposition had
been apparent, If "executive Interfeience
wllli the nlT.iIrs of a state" had been so very
"lopugnant to the feelings,'- would the re
puhhinn party have been so overwhelming
ly defeated nt tho polls ? The utterance Is
tardy, hut It Is better late than never and
wc cannot, therefore, find fault with this
extract from the message. As we have
said, It merits llie popular approval, but do,
Mr. President, make it Ihe highest kind of
eloquenco by corresponding action. Hut
wc have said enough relative to tho mes
sage In general and, perhaps, In particular
except In ono or two particulars which wo
shall speak of elsewhere and wc row ask
what is the use of theso annual messages,
except in tho Instances first nbovo men-
Honed i Arc not theso six and seven
column messages becoming n public nuis-
nuce? Is not the custom of their delivery
one more honored in ils breach than Its oh
seivnnco? Tho matters considered there
in havo been known to the country from one
week to six months or tnoic.the expressions
of opinion nre those which might be v.
peeled, and It Is useless lumber in a newn-
paper and wo aie afforded no dicreii.ni
but lo publish it. It only conies ..nee n
year, and wo can stand ii .ur lenders
can; We do nut infer lo tills particular
message any more th in we do to all Presi
dent's messages, In ordinary limes, afier
the first. We devoutly wish, but without
any hope therefor, that tills evil might bo
reformed and the constitution strictly com
piled with which only icquhes that the
President "shall, from lime to time, give
to the Pongrcss Infoimation of the state
of tlie Union, and recommend to their
consideration such measures as he shall
" judge necessary and expedient." This is
the requirement of the constitution and the
solo provision for President's messages,
but we sigh for rcloim in vain. Constitu
tions don't seem to be of much account
anyway.

lT.nSIDF.NT's MESSAGE.
New Yoke, Dec. 7.
Wall street does not like the tono of
President Grant's message, uor the report
of tlie secretary of the ticasury, as fore
shadowed In synopsis icports leccived here
this moinltig. Tliero was consequently a
decline iu tlie prices of various stocks this
morning from i to 2 per cent.
Tlie repoit of the seeietary of the treus
ur" favoiing the repeal of tho legal-tender
act on a certain day, tlie replacing of frac
tional currency with silver as fast as possl
hip, and fixing the time not more than
thiee years distant for the icsumptloii of
specie payment, knocked the gold pic.
inlum down to 1113.
The secietary'a agreement with the com
missloner of internal revenuo for abolishing
stamps on checks, matcher, etc., meets
with popular favor.
The president's statements advocating
tlie repeal ot the legal tender net disturbs
financial chcles, but his strong ground in
favor of resumption at no definite period is
not considered important.
TIIEKE IS MUCH SATISFACTION
that the Executive takes strong giound In
favor of thu Cuban Insurgents, and it is
hoped tlie whole power of the administra
tion will lie thrown in favor of tins long
struggling and resolute people.

A Washington special says Freeman
Cl.uk, n prominent member of the commit
tee on foreign affairs, declares there com
mendations of the president and Secretary
Urislow in relation to specie resumption
will have no practical effect upon con
gress, as the house is aheady 100 majority
against such measures.

week ago, 3,000,000 lets legal tenders,
ij.3,000,000 less deposits and $4,000 000
mori! loans. The specie lias gone to Eng
land. Thu greenbacks have gone south
and the volumes of loans is swelled by the
necessities of the season. Hut the hanks

per cent, reserve and tho increase of the
loans of spcclu nnd legal lenders Is not re
garded with satisfaction.

Tho wind takes up tho thickening sheet,
And drives abreast tho whirling stcct,
As If It would bo glad to show,

All grouped together, In a heap,
Though stupld.knowtliero'ssomcthlng wrong
And silent Bear their load along.

Away from home, to frenzy wrought,
Their panting steeds, attempt to urge.
And vainly ply the biting scourge.

Screaming nnd laughing, mixed with grum

Taking an unexpected bath,
Chilling their vain and useless wrath.

With crashing beavers, boots and bricks,

And each his neighbor ru lely clasping.
Tho Iron horse, awhile defies,

And try to clog his thundering wheels,
With feathery linkers ho scarcely feds.

In Ihercpoit of the dedication nt tlie new
Congregational church, your reporter, after
epoawng ot the amount ot money laid out
by the members of the church and society,
made use of the following words : " They
havo property, including chapel, building
ol, chinch nnd fixtures, on which they
have expended 00,000, and on which at
picsent only remains a debt of $10,000 ;
and from the well-known liberality of the
members ot the ciiurcn nnu tuo society. It
easnnahle to suppose Unit within tlio
space of a very few months tins debt will
be entirely naid." This prediction lias been
vXnioro Ihnii verified, nnd nllhoueh less than
three weens nave ciapscu since tho ileulca
tion, tlie debt has beeu entirely liquidated,
and, as expressed by the pastor of tlie
cliurcli dining his prayer last Sunday morn
ing, " the congregation can worship God
in tlie beauty ot holiuess " in a cliurcli on
which there is no incumbrance. There are
but few instances whcic a society which
includes iimong its members but a few
wealthy men, have erected a church of the
same size and beauty as tho one recently
dedicated at n cost of (including chapel)
SUU.uou, anil the same entirely lrce irom
debt, especially in such hard times ns wc
have had for the past fifteen months.
Every member of the church and society
have willingly and generously obeyed the
command ot scripture, ' Bring yo all the
tithes into tnc storehouse or the L.oru. in
fact some havo more than done it.
Soon after the dedication of the cliurcli,
Hon. H. G. Hoot proposed to pay $.2,000
towards the debt providing the remaining
$800 wn9 immediately raised. All took
hold with a will some even more than
doubling their original subscriptions.
When all have done so well it may seem
out of place to notice any particular men,
yet among the largest Honors are II. U.

the bell, $2,200, W. E. Hnwkcs $500, G.
S. Bradford and son $1,500, O. W. liar-

Booth $1,500, J. II. Loiing 500, E. A.
Cobb $500, T. W. Park, Esq. $1,000. and
the ladies of the society in addition to fur
nishing tho church, purchasing the organ,
etc., have given $700 in money. With
only two exceptions not a penny lias been
given by persons not connected with tho
cliurcli or society. Tho desk which cost
$125 was a gilt lrom the members ot thu
infant class in the sabbath school, while

In tlio evening tho regular monthly con
cert of prayer for foreign missions was
held, nud, although the evening was stormy,
quite n laigo audience was in attendance.
Tho larger part of tho evening was taken
up by Miss Anna Park, who, by tlio aid of
n chart suspended from tho desk, traced
tho different routes through the Pacific
ocean by tlio children's boat, the Jlorniug
Star, on which slio was n passenger for a
