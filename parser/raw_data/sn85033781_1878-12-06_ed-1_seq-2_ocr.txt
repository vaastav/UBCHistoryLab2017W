Vf.ksaili.f.h owes its existence to the
horror of death entertained ,y Louis
XIV. Like hi predecessors, he re-
tided at St. Denis, when not in Paris,
but, from the terrace of his palace, was
continually distressed by tho Bight of
tho towers of St. Denis, in whoso vaults
it was his doom to lie among other
French sovereigns.
Kace With a Prairie Fire.
Tho Yankton Press tells us of a lively
race General and L. A. Carney had with
the recent prairie fire. Traveling upon
an unburned strip they came-close to the
line of tho fire, which eitended miles
northwest and southwest, and was edg
ing slowly northeastward. When they
wero within twenty rods of this lino tho
wind suddenly increased and shifted
some twenty degrees toward tho east,
and from the west, sweeping the flames
directly upon them. What was five
minutes before a harmless fire, to bo
crossed with ordinary care, was now a
mass of continuous name, often ten to
fifteen feet high, and sometimes twenty
feet across. It roared like half a dozen
passenger trains at full speed. They
sprung from the wagon and fired the
grass, but it made very slow progress,
and had not burned ten feet square when a
whirlwind camo down the lino with a
high gale. Their only chance war
flight, and they sprung into the wagon
and whipped up their Texan horses fos
a race northward to some higher, stony
ground. The ponies understood that
game, and went readily. It was all done
in less time than the telling. The very
cause of danger was at last the means of
safety. The whirlwind, which was
twenty rods wide, passed by. It had
changed all the adjacent currents of
wind. This had deadened tho wind
ahead and prevented the firo from
spreading; and now that it had passed it
gave a chance to cross in its rear upon
the ground where tho grass was thin,
and within ten minutes of tho first ap
prehension of danger they wero among
the smoking cinders on burned ground.
The whirlwind went over the bluff and
down tho river bottom, filling it with
fire in places above the level of tho bluff,
and sending up a column of black smoko
which must have been over half a mile
in length.
How Diphtheria Was Spread.
A few weeks ago a littlo girl in St.
All ans, who had just recovered from
diphtheria, was taken by her parents to
visit a family in a neighboring town.
She slept with the children in that fam
ily, and shortly after three or four of
them were taken with the malady and
some have since died. The family ier
mitted relatives and neighlxrs to visit
them, and the result is several cases in
the neighborhood. They had public
funerals, even keeping the remains of
one cliild an unusual time, waiting for
another to die, so as to bury them to
gether, and this also spread the conta
gion. The physician was not powerfully
impressed as some physicians are not
with the contagious character of the dis
osisc; therefore, he did not take the
necessary precautions for the protection
of the neighborhood or of his own fam
ily, and the result is that one of his own
children has died and another is dan
gerously ill. A lady who went to one
of these houses to robe the victims for
the grave has called at houses in the
vicinity where there are children, with
out any change of her garments or any
attempt at disinfection, and has fondled
the children in those families, apparently
in utter ignorance of the danger to
which she was exposing them. ht. Al

The Presidont's Annual State

ot the Country.
Fellow-cirlztna of the Senate and House ef Rfpre
sentativea: Our heartfelt jrratltnde la due to the Tivine Be
ins, who holda in Hia hand the destinies of na
tion, ft r tho continued U-Mtowal during tho lattt
year of ruuutleaa blehKinv upon our country.
We are at ieace with all other uaUuim. Our pub
lic credit ha treatly liuirovtd. and i, petiiaiia,
now btrei.per than ever before. Abundant harvcxta
have rewarded the laltor of thou w ho till the soil,
our manufacturing iuduatrie aro reviv iuir. and it
in believed that general prosperity, w hich has been
so luuc uuxiouiily looked for, is at lust withiu our
reach.
Th Yellow FevtT,
The enjoyment of health by our people generally,
has. however, been interrupted, during the vat'
seaMoti, by the prevalence of a fatal pcntiknce. the
yellow fever, iu oiu portion of tho Southern
States, ereutimr an emeiveiicy which culled for
prompt and eiraordiuury iiit-ukiites ot relief. The
dic;i.-c api ur il a an f piilemie at New Orleans
and ut other plu.ee on the Lower MlHhiniiipi noon
utter midsummer. It was rapidly spread by fugi
tive troiu the infected eiiies and town, and did
not diHspjK-ar until early iu Knviiulnr. 'The
Slides l Louisiana. MuHiKKini'i and Tennessee
have sulfeivd severely. About lOo.ooO cukc are
believed to have occurred, of which ub-ut 20,000.
litwrdin to ilitcllk' lit estimate, proved fatal. It
is iuipoNKihlu to estimate, with any upproach to ac
euraey. the I'lss to the couutry occasioiicd by this
ei-idi inic. It is to be r -clu'iied by the hundrtd
luilli.'ii of dollui-H. The suifer.m; and destitution
that resulted excited the deepest sympathy in all
parts of the Vnioii. Physicians and iiursen hustenetl
troiu every (juarter to the assistance ot the u.'Ihcted
cmnniiiities. Voluntary eontriliutioii of money
and supplies, iu every needed torui, were speedily
und t'cuetvus"i fan.lud. The (eivtrnmeiit was
able to respond in some measure to the cull tor
I.elp. by providing tent, luetltcine und fi.od for
the sick and iletitule. the requisite direction tr
the jmrpose lni!:; wiven iu tlu c-uiUU-nt expectation
that tins actio!i i the Executive would receive the
SitlU-ti'HI of Coliuress. About l.M (' tellt. Utld rati lis
of the value ot bovt. 2.".('0H. wel'c sent to cities
and towns which applied lor them, mil detail ot
which will be fur lisl.ed to Congress by thu proper
deliarlmelit.
Tlie fearful ppro.1 of this pestilonee ha awnVenc-d

View d the necessity lor the most ill'eclive meas
ures, by quarantine and otherwise. f v the pr.'tec
tioi of our seaport, and the ceuntry em-rally,
trom this ainl other epidemics, it is recommended
that Conirress rive to the whole subject early and

The South.
The permanent pacification of the country by the
complete protection of ail citizen in every civil
and political ri'ht continues to be of paramount
interest with tie-L-reat b.,ly of ur people. Every
step in this direction is welcomed Willi public ap
proval, and every interruption of steady and uni
loiii! progress to the d-sm d consummation awak
ens (.'eiieral uuensiin ss und wit'u spread conh-mna-tioll.
The recent Congressional elect;. His have tur
ni'heil u direct and trustworthy test ot the advance
thus far made in the practical establishment of the
rlirht of suITraL'e. secured by the constitution t the
liberated race in the Southern Mates. All diturb
iin.' InHtiences. real or imaginary, had been removed
D'oiu all of these States.
T.ie three constitutional amendment, which con
ferred trccd in and equality of rivil and political
rights upon the people of the Soti'h. were adopted
by the concurrent action ot the trreat body of pood
ritizi ns who maintained the authority of the Na
tional (io eminent and thf integrity nn-1 jn rpetuity
ot the Union at such a cost ..f trea-iire and lite, us n
wise and lu-ci ssary embodiment in the organic law
ot the just result of the war. The people of tho
former shm-holdin;; State accepted these results,
and pave. Pi every practicable .'.inn. ussurances
that the Thirteenth. Fourteenth and Fiiteenth
amendment, nud laws passed in pursuance thereof,
should, ill L'ood faith, be enforced, riridly and im
partially, iu letter and spirit, to the end tliat tlio
humblest citicn. without distinction of race or
color, should, under them, receive full and
equal protection in person and properly and in po
litical lipids and privilepes. py these constitu
tional amendments the Southern section of the
Union obtained a larpe incre ase of political rower
in Conpress and iu the Electoral ( olh-pe. and the
country justly expected that elections would pro
ccifd. as to the enfranchised race, upon the same
circumstance of lopal and constitutional freedom
nml protection which obtained Pi all the other
States of the Union. The friends f law and order
loolo , forward to the conduct of these elections, as
offer! ii'' to the peiieral judpnii-nt of the country an
important opportunity to measure the depre'e in
which the rlpht of sulT rape could be exercised by the
rolori-d people, and would be respected by their
fellow-citizens: but a more peiieral enjoyment of
freedom of suffrape by the colored pe.-iple. and a
more just ond peiierous protection tf that freedom
by the communities of which they,' form a part,
were pemrally anticipated than the" record of the
elections discloses. In some of those State in
which the colored people lutve been unable to mal;
their opinions felt in the elections the result 1
mainly due to inthtences not easilv measured or
remedied by lepal protection; but in the States of
Louisiana and South Carolina at larpe. and in some
particular Conpressional districts outside of those
States, the record of the eh ctioiis seem to compel
the conclusion that the riphts of the eoh.icd voters
have been overridden, and their pnrti ipatmii iu
the elections not permitted to be either peiieral or
i roc.
It will be for the Conpress for which these dec.
tions were held to make such examinations into
their conduct as may bo appropriate to determine
the validity of tho claims of members to their seats.
In the meanwhile it becomes the duty of the Exec
utive and pudicial Departments of tho Government,
each in its province, to inquire Into and punish
violations of the laws of the United States which
have occurred. I can but repeat what I said in
this connection in my last messape. that whatever
auuiority rests witiune to this end I shall not hesi
tate to put forth, and I am unwilling to forcpo a
renewed appeal to the Lepislatures. the
courts, the executive authorities, ami the i-eople of
the States where these wronps have been per
petrated, to pive the ir assistance toward brinrinp to
justice the offender and preventinp a repetition of
the crime. Xo means within mv power will be
spared to obtain a full and fair investipation of tho
alh ped crimes, and to secure the conviction and
just punishment of tho puilty.
It is to be observed thut the principal appropria
tion made fer the Iepartment of Justice at the last
session contained the following clause: "And tor
defraying the expense which may Is- incurred in
the cntorccmont of the act approved Feb. 2
lb71. entitled. 'An set to amend an act ap
proved May 30. cist i 1 1 I an act to en
foivo the rights of citlz ns of the Unit-d State to
vote in (he several State of the Union, and for
ether purposes.' or any acts amendatory thereof or
supplementary thereto."
It is the opinion of the Attorney (renerel that the
expenses of these proceedings will lar-.ely exceed
the amount which was thus provided, und I may
rely confidently upon Com-res to make adequate
appropriations to enable the Executive iKpurtmciit
to enforce the Jaws.
Congressional Flection.
I respe tfully nrpe upon your attention that the
CeiiL-ressional elections, in evcrv district, in a very
important sense, are justly o matter of j.. liticul in
terest and concern throughout the wl:o.. ,oii!itry.
Each Slate, every political party, is entitled to the
shi.r - of p.,wer which I c len-d by th- 1- .al and
const, lutinnal sntlrae. It is tlm'ririit of ev.-rv
citien. possessing the qualilieatl. l:s prescribed by
law. to cat one iiiiinlimiihite.i ballot, and to have

Xo temporary or administrative interests of the

tion of our citizens to this tfreut Exposition
was well employed iu enerpetio and judicious
efforts to overcome this disadvantage. These i f
forts, led and directed by theCommtssionereteiieral,
were remarkably successful, and the exhibition of
the product of American Industry was creditable
and pratifyintf in scope and character. The reports

In accordance with the provisions of tho act of
Feb. 2, 1S7S, three Commissioners were appointed
to an international conference on the subject of
adopting a common ratio between gold and silver,
for the purpose of establishing, internationally,
the use of bimetallic moiiey, and securing fixity of
relative value between those metals.
Invitations were addressed to the various Govern
incut which hud expressed a wlllinpness to partici
putc ih it ueliberutions. The conference held its
iiK. tinps iu puri in Aupust last. The report of
the e ominissioiu-rs, herewith submitted, will show
its result. Xo common ratio between p.d.i and
silver could be apreed upon by tho conference.
The peiieral conclusion was reached that it is neces
sary to maintain in tho world the monetary func
tions of silver as well us of pold. leaving the selec
tion of the use of one or the other of these two
metals, or of both, to be made by each state.
Conpress bavin appropriated at it last session
the sum of $5.:(hi.(i(ki to pay the award of the Joint
Com mission at Halifax, if. after correspondence
with the Dritish Government on the subject of the
conformity of the award to the requirements of the
treaty and to the terms of the question thereby
submitted to the commission, the President shall
deem it his duty to make the payment, communi
cations upon these points were addressed to tho
British Government through the lepation of the
United States at London. Failing to obtain the con
currence of the liritisli Government in the viewa of
this Government resjieeting the award, I have
deemed it my duty to Under the sum uamed, with
in the year fixed by the treaty, accompanied by a
notice of the grounds of the payment, and protest
against any other construction of the same. The
correspondence upon this subject will be laid be
fore you.
The Spanish Government has officially announced
the termination of the insurrection in Cuba, and
the restoration of peace throughout that island.
Confident expectations are expressed ot a revival of
trade and prosperity, w hich it is earnestly hoped
may prove well-founded. Numerous claims ot
American citizens for relief for injuries or restora
tion of property have been among the incident of
the lonp-vontinued hostilities. Some of these claims
are in process of adiustnient by Spain, ami the
others are promised early and careful consideration.
The treaty made with Italy, in regard to reciprocal
consular privileges, l as been duly rstitied and pro
claimed. Xo questions of grave importance have arisen
with any other of the European powers.
The Japanese Government has been desirous of a
r. ii i:j of such parts of it treaties with loreipn
powers as relate to commerce, and. it 1 under
stood, has addressed to each of the treaty power a
request to open negotiations with that view. The
United State Government has been inclined to re
gard the matter favorably. Whatever restrictions
up. n trade with Japan are found injurious to that
people cannot but affect Injuriously nations hold

after a long period of seclusion, has within the past
few year ma le rapid strides in the path of etilipht
eniu i-uf an 1 progress, nnd. not unreasonably, i
lo. king forward to the time when her relations with
the nation ot Europe and America shall be ossim

A treaty looking t this e nd has been made, which
will be- submitted for tho consideration o the
Senate.

Iu the firepoi:ig statement of expenditures, actual
nnd estimated, no amount is allowed for the sink
ing fund provided f. r by the act upproved Feb. 2.,
which requires that 1 jer cent, of the entire
debt of the United States shall lie purchased or paid
within each fiscal year, to 1m set apart ns a sinking
fund. There hns ls eit. however, a substantial com
pliance with the conditions of the law. p.v its
term, the public debt should have been reduced
ls-tweeti lMi2 nnd the close of tho last fiscal year,
$ls.."Jil.NH5.2s; the actual reduction of the ascer
tained debt, in that ieriod. ha Is-eii S7'.i;4 l.7.'J;U'.l ,
Is ingiii excess of the reduction required by the
SinUng-Fiind at, $ Vi 12.22.0 ;:j.:i'l.
The amount of the public debt, less cash in the
treasury, Nov. 1. ls, was $2.(i21.2ii.osi.l a re
duction, since the same date lust year, of .2-M50.-017..7.I.
The progress made during tho last year in re
funding the public debt, nt lower rates of interest,
is very gratifying. The amount of 4 per cent, bonds
sold during the present year prior to Nov. 5M, 7f,
Is $100.270.!KiO. and per cent. bond, commonly
known as 5 20s, to an equal amount, have been or
will Ik redeemed as calls mature.
It has leen the policy of tho department to place
the 4 i r cent, bonds within easy reach of vcry
citizen who desires to invest hi savings, whether
small or great, in these securities. The Secretary
of the Treasury recommends that the law be so
modified that small sums mit bo invested, and
thnt. thriVh the Postofhces or other agents of the
Government, the freest opportunity mar te given
iu all parts of the country t.r such investments.
Ihe 1 st mode suggested is that tho department
e authorized to Issue certificate of ib posit, of tho
denomination of $1U. ls-aring Interest at the rate of
8.(s per cent. j-r annum, and convertible at any
tlmo within one, year alter their issue Into tho 4 per
cent, bond authorized by the Eefuiidliig act. and
to bo isned only in ex. ht.niro for United States
not. sent to the treasury by mail or otherwise.
Hiuli a provi-lon of Uw. supported bv suitable
regulation, would enable any person r.-sdilv. with
out cost or risk, to convert hi nionev into sn inter
est bearing security of ;ho Init -d Stat. . and the
niottey so re.-eiv.sl could be applied to the redemp
tion of per ct nt. bonds.
-Th coluaf of old during the last fiscal year was
$52.7lt?,,i'i. "The coinage of silver dollars, under
the act pod l . b. 2", 17", amounted on the 2 Id
of November, ls? to $ l'.t.M l..Vo, ot hich amount
4.,.evl.'.M aro in circulation, and the bulam e, f 14,
t2'.iMi'l is still iu the possession of the Government.
With views unchanged with regard to the act un
der which the coin aire-of silver proceeds. It lias been
the purpose of the Secretary tuithfully to excute the
law, and to afford a fair trial to the measure.
Iu the present financial condition of the country,
I am persuaded that the welfare of legitimate busi
ness ami Industry of every description will be best
promoted by abstaining from ail attempts to make
radical changes in the existing financial legislation.
Let it be understood thut during the coming year
business of the country will be undis
turbed by Governmental interference with the
laws affecting It, and we may confi
dently expect that the resumption of
specie payments, which will take place at the ap
pointed time, will be successfully and easily main
tained, and that it will bo followed by a healthful
and enduring revival of business prostMTity.
Let the healing influence ot time, the inherent en
ergies of our people, and the boundless resources ot
our country, have a fair opportunity, and relief
from present difficulties will surely follow.
.Military Affairs.
The report of the Secretary of War shows that the
army La been well aud economically supplied,
that our small force ha leen actively employed,
and has faithfully performed all the service re
quired of it. The morale of the army has im
proved, aud the numlH-r of desertions has mate
rially decreased during the year.
The Secretary recommends
1. That a pension be grunted to the widow of the
late Lieut. Henry H. lieuner. Eighteenth Infantry,
who lost his lite by yellow fever while in command
of the steamer J. M. Chambers, sent with supplies
for the relief of sufferers In the Kouth from that
disease.
2. The establishment of the annuity scheme for
the Ih-!i. fit of the heirs ot deceased officers, as sug
gested by tho Paymaster General.
8. The adoption by Congress of apian forthe pub
lication ot the records of the war of the Kebelllon,
now being prepared for that purpose.
4. The increase of the extra per diem of soldier
teachers employed in post-schools, and liberal ap
propriations for the erection of buildings tor
school nud libraries at the different peists.
5. The repeal or amendment of the act of June
IS, lsts. forbidding the use of the army as a oe
cotHitiitH, or otherwise, for the purpose of execut
ing the laws, except in such cases and under such
circumstances as may 13 expressly authorized by
the constitution or by act of congress."
ti. The pussaite ot a joint r solution of Congress
lciulizing the issue of ration, tents arid medicines
which were made for tho relief of suil'erers troiu
yellow fever.
T. That prevision be made for the erection of a
nre-proof building for the preservation of certain
valuable records, now constantly exposed to de
struction by tire.
These recommendations are commended to your
favorable consideration.
Niivul Affairs.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy show
that the navy has improved durinp the last ils.-al

8M. 43 exceeding the appropriations .f the present
year only S'Ki.K 10.73: w hich excess is occasioned by
the demand of the Naval Academy and Marino
Corps, as explained in the Secretary's report. The
appropriations for the present fiscal year are $14.-62.-.J1.70,

will be ample for all the current expenses of the de

should the postal service be reduced by

The rmtinal report of Ihe Secretary of the In
terior and the (.Viinins-i .n, r f ln.'lian Affair
present an elartTu ate a. count of the pr. sent condi
tion of the Indian tubes, and ot that, branch of the
public service winch minister . their interest.
While the conduct of the Indians, generally, h is
been orderly, and th.-;r l-iations with 'their
neighbors lriendly ad pea. etui, two local
disturbance have cecum I. wi n h w ere de
plorable in their character. but remained,
happily, confined to a comparatively small numb, r
of Indian. The discontent among th- i:.um.. ks.
which led flrt to some acts of violence ' 11 the j.art
of some of tho members of the tribe, and finally to
the outbreak, appears to have been caused bv on
ilisumeieney of food 011 the reservation, .ml this in-
suUicicucy to have Iseti owing t the it:ad -.jnacv ot
the appropriation, made by (. 01,-ics. to 'the
wants of the Indians, at a" time when the
Indians were prevtnt.-d from supplying the d ii
t i. iicy by hunting. Alter an arduous pursuit bv
the trooj.s of the United State, and several engage--nient.
the Imstil.) Indian were redu.ed to sub.
je( tion. and tho larger part of th.-ni surrendered
themselves a prisoners. In this connection id...
sire to call attention to fh rc-onim. nd.itioii made
by the Secretary of the Interior, Nut a su.Hci. nt
tun.l be placed at the disposal ot the Fxccu'jve, to
bo used, with proper accountability, nt discretion,
in sudden emergencies of tho Indian service.
Tho other caso of disturbance was that of a band
of Northern Cheyennes who suddenly left their re
servation iu tho Indian Territory ami marched rap
idly through the States ot Kansas aud Nebraska iu
the direction of their old hunting-grounds, commit
ting murders and other crimes on their wav. 1'ioni
documents accompanying the report of the Secre
tary of the Interior, it appears that this disorderly
band was ns fully supplied with the necessaries of
life as the 4.700 nther Indians who remained .juietly
ou the reservation, and that the dhstni bam e
was caused by men of a restless nnd mischievous,
disposition among the Indians themselves. Almost
tho whole of this band havo surrendered to the
military authorities, and It Is a gratifying fact that
when some of thnnhad taken refuge in the t amp
of the lied Cloml Sioux, w ith whom they have been
In friendly relations, the Sioux held them a prison
ers nnd really pave tlirm up to tho olliceis of tho
I nited States, thug giving new proof of tho - loyal
spirit which, alarming rumors to tho contrary not
withstanding, they have uniformly shown ever
since the wishes they expressed nt the couit' il of
beptember, 1.-77, had bteu complied with.
f Both the Secretary of the Interior and the Hecre.
lary of War unite la the recommendation that pro
vision be made by Congress for the organization of
corps of mounted "Indian auxiliaries," to be
tinder the control of the army, and to be used for
the purpose of keeping the Indians on their reser
'vations and preventing or repressing disturbance;
on their part. I earnestly concur in this recom
mendation. It is believed that the organization of
such a body of Indian cavalry, receiving a moderate
pay from the Government, would considerably weak
en the restless element among tlm Indians by with
drawing trom it a number of young men aud giving
them congenial employment under the Government,
it tsving a matter of experience that Indians in our
service almost without exception are faithful in the
performance of the duties assigned to them. Such
an organization would materially aid the army in
the accomplishment of a task for which its nu
merical strength Is sometimes found insufficient.
Hut, while the employment of force tor the pre
vention or repression of Indian troubles is of occa
sional necessity, and wise preparation should bo
made to that end, greater reliance must Is; placed
on humane and civilizing agencies for the ultimato
solution of what is called tho Indian problem. It
may be very difficult, aud require much patient
effort, to curb the unruly spirit of the savage In
dian to the restraints ot civilized lite, but experi
ence shows that it is not impossible. Many ot the
triU'S which are now quiet and orderly and self
aupporting were once as savage as any that at pres
ent roam over the plains or In the mountains ot the
far West, and were then considered inaccessible to
civilizing influences. It may bo impossible to raise
them fully up to the level of the white population
of the United States; but we should not forget that
they are the aborigines of the country, aud called
the soil th.ir own on which our
people have grown rich, powerful, and
happy. We owe it to them as a moral duty to help
tin m'in attaining at least that degree ot civilization
which they may be able to reach. It is not only
our duty it is also our interest to do so. Indians
who have become agriculturist or herdsmen and
feel an interest in'propcrty w ill thenceforth cease to
be a warlike and disturbing element. It is also a
well-anthcutlcated fact that Indian aro apt to bo
peaceable and quiet when their children areat school,
and I am gratified to know, from tho expressions
ot Indians themselves and from many concurring
reports, that there is a steadily increasing desire,
even among Indians belonging to comparatively
wild tribes, to have their children educated. I in
vite attention to the reports of the Secretary of tho
Interior and tho Commissioner of Indian. Affairs
touching tho experiment recently inaugurated,
in taking fifty Indian children, boys an 1
girls, front different trilss. to the Hampton
Normal Agricultural Institute, tu Virginia,
whero they ure to receive an elementary
English education and training in agriculture and
other useful work, to Is returned to.thelr tribes,
after the completed course, as interpreters, in
structors and examples. It is reported that tho
ofttocr charged with tho selection of those children
mi-ht have had thousand ot young Indians sent
with him had it Ueii possible to make provision
for them. I agree with the Secretary of the In
terior in saying that the result of this interesting
experiment, if favorable, may bo destined to In
come an -important factor iu the advancement of
civilization among tho Indians."
The question whether a change in the control of
the Indian service should be made was, at the last
session of Congress, referred to 11 committee for in
quiry nud report. Without desiring to anticipate
that report. I venture to express the Iiojk that, in
the decision of so important a question, the views
evjir.-ssed above may not be lost sight of. and that
the d. oision. whstev. r it may 1'. will arrest further
agitation f thi subject, such agitation being apt
to produce a disturbing e ffect upon the service as
well as on the Indians themselves.
Hot Spring; Commission.
In the enrollment ot the bill making approprbv
tions for su:id: v civil expenses, at the lust session
ot Congress, that portion which provided tr the
continuation of the )ot Springs Commission was
otuitt-d. A tin- commission had completed the
work t taking testimony on the many eonriloti'ig
claims, tin suspension ..f their labors. Wfore de
termining the rights of claimants, threatened for a
time to embarrass the interests not only
ot the Gov. rum.-nt. but also of a largo
number ot the citiens .if Hot springs,
who were waiting for final action
011 their claims before beginning cotit.-iiijdaleil im
provements. In or lor to prevent serious .lilVu-ulti.-s
which were apptvh. inleO. and lit the solicitation of
many lea ling citizen of Hot spring, nml others
interested ill the welfare of the town, the Secretary
of the Inferior was authorized to request the late
Commissioner to take charge of the records r.f
their proceedings, ami b perform such wt.rk a
could properly be done by them under such eir
cumstano s. to facilitate the fl indication ot the
claims :.t an early day. and to preserve the status
ot the claimant net;! their riphts should bo
finally determined. Tie- late Commissioners com
j'lied with that re.pt. l. and rcj..rt that Ihe testi
moiiey. iti a!! th- .-as. , ha Im-imi written out. ex
amined, briei'-d. and so arranged us to facilitate nn
early settlement niieti authorized bylaw. It is re
commended that the requisite authority be given
at a early a day iu the session ns possible, mid
that a fair conipeiisiitioit be allowed the late Com
missioners for the exjM-nes incurred unci the labeir
perfouied by them since the filth of June last.
Tinitwr I.nn.ls.
I Invite the attention of Congress to the recom-m.-mbiti
ins made by the Secretary of the Interior
w ith regard t tin preservation "(,f the timber on
the public lands ot the United State. Tho jpro
tection of the public property is one of first duties
of the Government. The I'cpartnicnt of the Interior
should, therefore, lit enabled by siithYieiit appro
priation to enforce the laws in that respect, lint
this matter appears still more ini)ortaiit a a ques
tion of public economy. The rapid destruction of
our forests is a;i evil fraught with the
gravest consequences. especially in the
mountainous district, where the rocky slopes, once
denuded ot their trees, w ill remain so forever.
There the in jury, once done, cannot be repaired. I
fully concur with the Secretary of the Interior in
the opinion that for this reason legislation touch
ing the public timber In the mountainous State
nu,d Territories of the West should be esjiecially
well considered, and that existing laws, in which
the destruction of the forests is nt sufllcieutlv
guarded against, should be speedily modified. A.
general law concerning this important subject
appears to me to be a matter of urgent public ne
ctsoity. giieutlure.
From the organization of the Government the im
portance of encouraging, by all possible means, tho
increase of our agricultural pr jdu.-tion ha ., Im-. u
acknowledged and urged upon the uttont.i of Con
gress and the people ns the surest and readiest
means f increasing our substantial and enduring
prosperity.
The word e, Wellington are ns applicable to
day lis when. Pi his eighth annual message, he said:
'Jt Is not t. be doubted with reference either to
individual or national welfare, agriculture is of
primary importance. In proportion as nations ad
vance in population and other circumstance of
maturity thi truth becomes more apparent, and
renders the cultivaii. .11 ot the soil more und more
an object of public patronage. Institutions lor
promoting it -prow up. supporte d by the public
purse- and to what ob.ect call it bo dedicated With
greater propriety Among the. uean which havo
been employed to this end. none have been attended
with great, r success than the establishment of
boards, composed .f proper characters, charged
with collecting and diffusing information, and en
abled, by premium and small p. uniarv aids, to
ciioiira"" and n.tt the spirit of discovery and im
provement, this spe.-i.-s of establishment contribut
ing d .ubly to the increase of improvement by stim
ulating to c'.itcrpii.-e und experiment, and by dravv
ing t n comm. n eeut-r the results everywhere of
individual skill and observation, nnd bpivadin.r
th. in thence ov. r the whole nation, llvt erieiice .-
cordiiigly hath sli .-.vii that they 11 iv very cheap in
struments ot imm-;:s. iutionai bint fit."
The great preponderance of the agriultnral over
any other interest iu the United States entitles it to
