Lord Rosebcry has taken the two countries of
the ■speaking world by storm. Quick and
complete — for "Lord Chatham" ha? been off the
press barely two weeks — is the praise of the -fore
most critics of England and America. Here are
the first reviews :
"Its brilliancy, balance and scope recall those
lew great biographies which have attained a per
manent fame."
"A volume of profound interest and of engag
ing charm."
'"The sort of book no man could have written
unless inspired by his -übject. The writer is
rp.nicd away by his work as completely as the
reader."
"To write in this manner is a great art and Lord
Rosebery is one of the few of its possessors."
"If comparisons had not been condemned as
odious. I would proclaim Lord Rosebery the
Kacanlay of his day and generation."
As a biography this book has the continuity
and logic of a work of art. and it will rank with
the great biographies in the English language."

Whether this E».o<»i transaction referred

TO IMPROVE ELLIS ISLAND
Secretary of Treasury Asks
$860.200-Wants New Building.
fFrnm The Trlbane Btrreaa. J
Washington. Per. 7.— Despite the careful
pruning of the estimates just submitted to
Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury
an appropriation of tSBB^tR is asked for
necessary improvements at Ellis Tslarul.
The largest single appropriation asked ia
that of "•""' for Tiie complete construc
tion "' a new building on the north side
of the main island. Other improvements
which require larj;e expenditures arc the
construction of ■> steel hull ferryboat at a
cost of . .- ,< an the extension -•■ the
main island on the north side with con
crete sea wall. In giving his reasons fo>
the estimates submitted. Commissioner
William? says:
"About 2.5C0.C00 p:;?=engers are carried
annually by our present ferryboat. She is
more than six years okl. and during this
period has been in constant service except
during the short intervals when hauled up
for repairs. The ferry passage to Elli-
Island is perhaps the most dangerous in
New York ■ Harbor. Common prudence dic
tates thai we should are ■ second ferry

KAISER FAST. IF DISABLED
German Liner, Shy a Propeller.
Hours Ahead on Run to Port.
Captain Polack, commander of the North
German Lloyd liner Kaiser Wilhelm der
Grosse. is thoroughly disgusted with the
port propeller of his vessel and is glad that
he dropped it off ■'.[■.,<• on Monday aft* ■
noon. The Kaiser made an unusually gn««i
run to port notwithstanding the accident,
and instead nf getting In at 3 p. m. yes
terday, as <^aptain Polack expected, she
passed the Ambrose Channel Lightship at
5:45 a. m.
Captain Polack. who is accustomed .to
making the Kaiser Wilhelm der Gro go
ee.tft without a rudder a,nd ■ ante we with
one propeller, surprised himself by coining
in yesterday with art average speed for the
voyage of 19.21 knots, though he ran for
42 hours at "educed speed. Tbe skipper
