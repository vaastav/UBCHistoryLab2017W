DAILY GLOBE, St. Paul, Minn.
sobsgbiptM PRICrT" eeduced,
Tin- "Globe" Hereafter to be Fur*
nished at Lower Kates and the Qual
ity as Well as Quantity Improved.
Readers of the Globe have been frankly
advised of the tendency among the leading
papers to reduce their rates to the public.
This course, for some time, has been
inevitable. The price of news
papers had not, until recently,
been reduced since the. advance which
took place during the war. Nearly ever} -
thing else has suffered a decline, but news
papers have stood at one dollar per month,
the same as in 1865. There was some
reason for the retention of "war prices," as
labor has increased rather than
a runaway accident a few days ago, is con
valescent.
;';:_. The Globe has, however, decided to meet
the popular demand for cheaper newspa
pers, without impairing the quality of the
paper. In fact, it will be greatly im
proved in every respect, no labor or ex
pense being spared to make it still
more complete as a news
paper than it his been. With the intro
duction of its new perfecting press the '
Globe will be increased in size to an ex- .
tent equal to the addition of five of its J
present columns. The plans for addi- j
tional news service, which cannot be fully -
developed until our new quarters and new <
press facilities are available, are simply '
immense, far surpassing anything '
heretofore attempted in this locality. '
All of this we hope to . have ,
duly inaugurated early in January, when -
our new thirty thousand dollar press, with t
a capacity of producing fifteen thousand c
newspapers per hour, is set in operation. t
To reduce the price of a newspaper and a
correspondingly cheapen the subject mat- c
ter it affords, would by no means be ap- E
predated, but when coupled with the re- B
duction, improvement in every department
takes place, we feel sure the movement will f '
be welcomed.
a
The publishers of the Globe have, ac- 8
cordingly decided, notwithstanding the c
increase in size aud quality proposed, to *«
make the price of the paper, on and after 6
December 1,1883, EIGHT DOLLARS w
PER YEAR, for seven issues per week | a
delivered by carrier.?, and SIX DOL- •■'
LARS PER YEAR for six isnnes per week, '
(Sunday's issue omitted) sent by mail. t i
As a first class newspaper is thus placed M
within the reach of all, it is trusted that b,
the circulation of the Globe will only be
limited by the population within its
geographical radius. Pl

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. bo
We give, rati as a custom than as a no
matter of intereii, President Arthur's mes- Pu
sags to congress, deliverod yesterday. 1$ ca!
is decidedly common place, being chiefly '°
reviews of departmental reports and con va'
taiuing few - if any original ideas. in
President' Arthur's desire to be his own of
successor evidently precludes his having for
any opinions at present. Opinions aro as tie
dangerous as letter writing.for a Presiden- chi
tial candidate. .It will not do '. to adopt lan
Henry Clay's motto— would rather ,be err
right than President"—if a person ever sal
hopes to .reach the White House. Mr. Arthur bu;
does not 1 propose to take the Henry 1
' Clay chances. He would rather be Presi- pu!
dent than have an opinion, and his Vines- im;
\ sage is a success in that respect. If he era
had merely said, *I herewith transmit the effc
v. department reports, and recommend every- asi
: thing they recommend," and then ; signed g-a
;■ - his name," he would have covered the same las

papers of a good . deal of trouble. Be
. sides, his message would, in that event,
have been generally read.
OUR LOADED"^ 3TAYOR.
When that celebrated knight errant, Don
Quixote, was traveling in search of adven
■ ture.his vivid imagination was always con
juring up imaginary foes who were anx
ious to test the prowess of his lanco. In all
of his visionary, engagements he was ably
seconded by his companion and servant,
Sancho Panza, who invariably saw the
same sights and recognized the • same per
ils as those which confronted his master.
.The Mayor of St. Paul is evidently "de
sirous of playing the part of Don Quixote
to a coterie of Sancho Fanzas. Having
set himself up as, par excellence, the great
moral reformer of this community, he has
impudently assumed that all. other offi
cials, and especially the city council, are
in favor of vice, and his own personal
deadly foes on account of his distinguished
virtue. The wonderful contest which he
is waging—in his mind's eye—has
so' wrought upon him that he re
cently announced, at an official meeting,
that he had armed himself in self defense,
and proposed to valiantly defend his re
form principles at the mouth of the revol
ver. The special apprehension of the
Mayor seemed to be Mr. P. T. Kavanagh,
one of our prominent and reputable
bujiness men, whose alleged opposition
to the moral reforms of the Mayor render
ed the hip pocket arsenal a necessity.
The windmills which Don Quixote imag
ined were desperate and deadly foes, have
their counterpart in the morbid retina of
oar reform Mayor. Instead of Mr.
Kavanagh beia_; an opponent of the
Mayor's on the moral reform question, he
administered a very just and fitting re
buke to Mr. O'Brien, by refusing his
(O'Brien's) urgent reqnest to go upon the
bail bond of a disreputable woman who
was being defended in the courts, by the
present Mayor, for the violation of the
famous ordinance No. 10.
Col. Allen, the president of the council,
is another, imaginary foeman of the
Mayor, who seeing in him a contestant of
dire dimensions, requested a gentleman to
notify the pastors of the leading churches
last Sunday, that their congregations must
be on the alert to repel the coining on
slaught of Col. Allen and his fellow coun
cilmen, upon the bulwark of onr liberties—
known as ordinanoe No. 10. The male
members of the respective congregations
were accordingly called into secret council
last Sunday evening and requested to ap
pear, for the purpose of moral effect, at
the council meeting last evening.
A goodly number responded' to
the note of alarm sounded by
our "loaded" Mayor, only to find out that
the city council have Dot the slightest idea
of coming to the rescue of our modern
Don Quixote by placing him in the cate
gory of a martyr to moral reform.
It was simply a gratuitous and impudent
insult which the "loaded" Mayor accorded
the council when he sent. his appeal for
help to the churches. He is neither
in danger personally or otherwise, and his
public announcement that he is "loaded,"
is simply a ridiculous reflection upon him
self. He need give himself no uneasiness '
about his personal safety or his "moral" '•
reform. The council is composed of a ]
body of honorable men, who, to put it '
mildly, have got as much interest in the ,
welfare of the city and its good name j
as the pastors who were bamboozled <
into firing their alarm guns last Sunday 1
night. The honor and morals of the city '
san be a good deal more safely trusted in '
their hands than in thos3 of our "loaded,"
and pompous Mayor, because they are ]
jool headed, intelligent, sensible gentle- t
nen, to whom the public interests can be »
iafely intrusted. i
The sooner our "loaded" Mayor asoer- *
sains that the movements of the plane- v
;ary system do not depend upon his nod 8
md wink, and that he is not _
uperior to the combined wisdom of r
leeturies, the sooner will he cease to erect I
vindmihs on which to shiver his lance, c
Jood people lived before he was born, and £
re might modestly express the belief, even
.t the risk of mortally offending his ma
estic Mayorship, thai there are at least a t _
ew of cotemporary existence who are c ;
qually as earnest in genuine morality, as S(
he attorney who .broke friendship with n.
Ir. Kavanagh because he would not go a!
ail for Kittle Smith. hi

DOMINION HOMESTEADS. A
The Canadian minister of the interior la
anoauced last week an important change b:
f policy regarding the distribution of
mds in the northwestern portion cf the
ominion. The "southern reserve," the ex- **
msivo region between the Canadian Pa- pi
fio belt and the United States line, com- _
rising some four million acres, whioh was ci
ithdrawn from settlement in 1882, is to wt
> opened for homestead and pre-emption
■tries after the : first of next
muary. This region is ', in- tel
rseoted by a branoh of the Canadian °
icifio railroad, and for some distance by _"
o Manitoba & Southwestern railway^ and C
is believed that it will be rapidly taken W°
> by settlers.
Another extensive tract about to be chi
rown open for settlement is the "mile m
It,— that is, the even numbered sections *'■<
ong and on both sides of the . Canadian J;
icifio railway. This was withdrawn in *■**•*
arch of last year, but is announced to be
opened January Ist, 1884, for the bene- y< _
of aotual settlers who will reside en g *{
sir claims, and on the condition that the
cupants will reduce at least one-fourth J
each quarter section to cultivation Tw
thin the period of three years after *°
iking entry. The large reserve connect
with the Regina town site, about 350 -_/
ties west from Winnipeg, will likewise be . _
eedily offered for sale at $5 per acre, to .
na fide settlers, only, and in quantities
>t to exceed one quarter section to each
irehaser. With this privilege of par- -
ase are coupled also the same condi- aI
>ns of residence and culti
tion as. in the case of homsteads jos
the mile belt, and after the expiration dai
three years the settler who has con- ere
rmed to these requirements will be enti- cult
>d to a rebate of half the original par- son
ase money, and to the patent for his "****
-3 d. Should he fail, however, the gov
iment reserves the - right to cancel the -
le and return the purchase "money to the rec
yer without interest. \ ges

THE ST. PAUL DAILY GLOBE, WEDEJSTSDAT MORNIIHG DECEMBER 5.1883.
Canadian Pacific railroad will be rapidlj
peopled. The condition of the soil enc
the climate are claimed to be in most re
spectsas' favorable to * agriculture, anc
stock raising as they are on this side o:
the line, and the inducements offered art
fully as liberal as those accompanying th<
privilege of occupying the public lands
belonging to the United States'.
CURRENT COMMENT.
The organic law of the territories provide)
for each having three United States judges, oni
of whom is' designated as chief justice. Thi
system works badly in the fact that the threi
justices in general term form the ; territoria
court of appeals, and each member is ' accord'
ingly caused to sit in review upon appeals fron
his own decisions. To obviate this the peopli
of Dakota are petitioning for the appointmen
of a fourth district judge, which is the numbei
congress . has bestowed upon- Wyoming. It
Montana the public interest is worse off thai
elsewhere, as there are only two district judge!
in that territory. Last April the president war
induced to suspend Judge Conger, of the Firsi
district, on charges which apparently have nol
been maintained, but the clique who secured his
suspension have hud sufficient interest in Wash
ington to prevent its removal. Senator Conge
st Michigan, a brother of the judge, has taker
the outfit in hand, and those who know him art
of the opinion that there will be hair flying ir
Washington before the judge is officially decap
itated. Meanwhile, there has not been a^civi
case tried in eastern Montana^einceiihe fall ci
1882, and no criminal trials nave been held ir
Custer county since last May, nor can "there bo
any, from present appearances, before the spring
of 1884.
The propriety of reducing, the number oi
p^rts of entry in the United States is made mani
fest by some of the figures in the report of the
secretary of the treasury. There are useless
easterns districts sustained only to cater to local
pride or interest. There are twenty-two ports
of entry at which it has happened that not a
dollar of duties has been collected for years.
There are thirty-two ports of entry in which the
year's collections from all sources have ' not
equalled the year's expenses. These' had; ; im
portance when foreign trade was carried on in
sailing vessels, and before the concentration of
importations at large ports from regular lines of
steamers, and the present system of rapid inland
transportation. The custom houses in these
districts are, however, kept up, with all the
formalities of activity, with deputies, inspectors
and clirks, whose sole duty is to draw their
emoluments, and to make official returns to the
accounting .officesJ of the j treasury and the
bureau of statistics. The sinecuris'ts must go.
The navy department is anxious to send the
United States ship-of-war Shenandoah, now
lying im Boston harbor, around "the Horn" to
California, but great difficnlty is experienced in
securing officers and men to conduct her. It is
complained of her that she is an unseaworthy
tub. One officer who was on her on her last
long cruise declares that she is likely to go
down at any time in a heavy blow at sea. She
is too heavily sparred and armed, and is noto
rious in the navy for rolling more than any
other vessel in the service. In addition to these
serious disadvantages, her accommodations are
said to be inferior and uncomfortable. Ween
we have so few naval vessels it seems a pity that
any of them shoal ■ be unfit to send to sea.
Ix view of the fearful prevalence of late of
murders and outrages in rural districts, where,
through the incompetence of the local police,
the perpetrators frequently escape detection, a
proposition has been made that in each state
there should be a central detective corps at tho
disposal of th? attorney general. They will be
available for securing evidence in civil cases
coming under the jurisdiction of that official,
and would furnish for the solving of criminal
problems a staff of cool-headed, capable detec
tives, free from local prejudice, and expert in
ferreting out malefactors. Some system should
certainly be adopted for bringing to justice the
host of murdering fiends, whose misdeeds. fill
such space in the columns of the daily press of
the country.
The sound Democratic objection to Mr.
Blame's fair sounding proposition to divide the
ax on spirituous and malt ligaors among the
■tates in the basis of population, is that it would
nake the people of the states dependent upon
he national government for their revenue, and
vould substitute national for state agencies to
upport local institutions. It would tend to
lostpone indefinitely the much desired revenue
oform. The states can well provide their ewn
evenue, and are amply possessed of machinery
or its collection, and no real saving cou'd be
ffected in this respect by a bid of that kind
rom the federal government.

8 1 Special Telegram to the Globe. J
B Chicago, Deo. 4.The announcement
c that a traffic agreement ; had been entered
1 into between the Union Pacific, Rock Is
land and Milwaukee roads, caused consid
-1 erable excitement, and still forms the prin
i cipal topic of : discussion in railroad cir
r cles. Although it has been rumored for
j some time • past, that a movement was on
i foot by which these three roads were to
i form an offensive and defeneive alliance
9 as far as the Nebraska and Colorado busi
t ness is . concerned, still there
t were few who . believed that
3 the consummation of such an
. arrangement was really contemplated.
c The general opinion was that the rumors
i were rather started for the purpose of
3 securing concessions from the Chicago,
x Burlington & Quicoy. The Union Pacific
. has for some • time been trying to secure
1 allies east of the Mississippi river, bat did
E not succeed until now on account of the
, reluctance of the lowa lines to break up
, their pooling agreement. By a system of
, discrimination in favor of the St. Paul
and Rock Island the Union
Pacifio at last succeeded in gain
! ihg its end, when the St. Paul
. gave its notice of withdrawal from the
, lowa peol about two weeks ago. The
. Union Pacific general manager and gen
l eral freight agent at once appearod upon
, the scene and labored assiduously
, with the St. Paul and Rock Island officials
for several days to prevent them from
, changing their position. The St. Paul, it
. appears, was only too willing to accede to
■ the wishes of the Union Pacific, and conse
quently the Rock Island, although re
luctuantly, also decided to cast its lot
with the same road. Ever
since these roads have been
figuring on the new traffic agreement
and have finally come to an understanding.
The agreement entered into last Saturday
will have yet to be approved by the direc
tors of the three roads, and for this reason
hopes are entertained that the directors
of one or the other of them may put a
veto on the arrangement. The officers of
the Rock Island and Union Pacifio left for
New York Saturday evening
for the principal purpose, it is
claimed, of bringing the natter
before the directors of their roads and
having them act upon it at once. Whether
the Northwestern is to be admitted into
the new combination or not is still an
op9n question. General Manager Marvin
Hoghitt had a long conference Saturday
afternoon with the general managers of I
the Union Pacific and Rook Island regard
ing the matter, and it is stated the latter j
showed a willingness to admit the North-!
western tnto the combination provided
that road would make come
concessions to the other liae^
regarding the Sioux City & Pacific busi- \
ness west of the Missouri Pacifio. No
definite information could be gained at
the Northwestern offices yesterday regard
ing the matter, Mr. Hughitt being out of '
town. It was stated at the office that Mr. ! •
Hugnitt had gone to Wisconsin, but it is j 1
rumored New York. A prominent officer <
of the Northwestern said the road had '
entered into no arrangements as yet with '
the Union Pacific and the other roads, but '
admitted the matter had been under '
consideration. He said the North- <
western was for maintaining <
peace among the lowa lines and would «
use its best efforts to that end. But if war '
came the Northwestern was prepared for
it and would protect its own interests. It
was evident from his remarks that the t
Northwestern is not disinclined to join the
Union Pacifio, St. Paul and Rock Island *
combination, if a reasonable arrangement _
with those roads can be made. The rea
son that the combination is willing to ad
mit the Northwestern is said to be a de- f
sire on the part of the St. Paul and _
the Rock Island to prevent "a _
war of rat', on Northwestern _
business. With the Northwestern road in i
the combination the Northwestern rates _
cannot be disturbed, as neither the Chi
cago, Burlington & Qaincy nor . the Wa- _
bash can get to St. Paul and beyond ex- a
cept over the lines controlled by the Rock _
Island, St. Paul or Northwestern. If the f
agreement is consummated the Chicago, f
Burlington & Qaincy, Northwest- „
era, Pacific and Wabash will be
compelled to fight the combination, and
one of the most bitter wars ever fought n
among western roads will result. As stated S
above, if the Northwestern comes into the p
combination the Northwestern business B
cannot be affected by such a war, but it in- ci
solves the Southern Railroad association d
and the Colorado Traffics association, a3 p
well as the lowa Trunk Line association. t<
What steps the Chicago, Burlington &, $
Qnincy, Missouri Pacific and Wabash roads ul
frill take to meet the forces of $'.
he . Union Pacific and its allies M
is yet a matter of speculation. Pc
General Manager Potter of the Chicago, $;
3urlington & Qnincy, is at Bnrlington cvi- t*
lently discussing with President Perkins $1
That course to pursue, g The other officials F<
if the Chioago, Burlington & Qnincy claim $1
o know but little regarding the matter, an
>ut they say if the war does come off they Ft
rill be well prepared for it, and that their ta
oad will be able to inflict more. damage ta:
pon the Union Pacific combination than
he latter can upon their line.

Chicago, Dec. 4.—President R. R. Cable,
f the Rock Island, left for New York on
ist Saturday evening, accompanied by
Ir .H. H. Porter, a director of his road, to on
ttend the meeting of the board of direct- in<
rs in that city. The fact that Mr. Porter do

IHE IDEAL SEASON. ' ■, _

If there were any skeptics as to the fast 1
Id that the lighter and more fascinating
ier of musical compositions have on the
diligence. and culture of St. Paul, all
übts could have been dispelled at a
race at the exceedingly large and tie- w
nt audience <that assembled at the Opera _
use last night. h
The audience was large and sumptuous, _,
d while the Boston Ideals were at their **
st, the honors were mutual, as any com- ni
ny should . have felt complimented by ?
sh a flattering audience. ' Parquette, r°
538 circle, gallery and boxes were filled * c
as gay and fashionablo an audience 1?
ever assembled in St. ' Paul. [-.
c opera was Girofle-Girofla, by Lecocq 111l 11
i the score is written in the author's '
i3t bright aai rollicking vein; the tem-1 nc
is fast and sprightly and the interest is ye
rcr allowed to flag by long and dull in- 8Q
vals. The libretto has a perfect a *=
tof dialogue, but this is not tame from m'
fact that it is wedded to smart astion, /
i hence the . necessity for a high order
iramatio ability to make the scenes
■fectly enjoyable. -V^JU__£_SBtt
Lhe' characters of the title role fo
:e taken by Marie Stone, and this of So
irse is the central role in the operatta. wt
r impersonation of the twin sisters was na
hly finished and artistic as to musical go
ibty and make-up, and indeed she sang of
I acted the role in a the
rited and \ enjoyable manner, an
s a part, however, which calls for great ho
ndon and chic, particularly in the tipsy wh
ac in the second act.T Her J acting sof lef
i scene was aroh, but marked by .'a;- too pfat
drestraint. Perhaps • this was judi- to!
is, for it is difficult -to /pause \on ■' the tra
line where art in this scene gives-way to
too much abandon or recklessness.
Her solo, "See how it sparkles, this
drink divine," was a gem and it received
hearty applause, Mr. Barnabee sang and
acted the role of Don. His makeup was
unique, and he imparted most of the life
to the performance., That he is a funny
comedian and a good singer
there can be no doubt
but at times he just verges on buffoonery.
This, however, in characters of this lati
tude, was pardonable, especially as he
made an enjoyable papa throughout. Miss
Phillips, a3 Aurore, was in her element,
and this excellent artist did the part to
perfection and her solo being very enjoy
able indeed.
The dancing in the second act by the two
latter, was the burlesque hit of the even
ing, and it was given with such utter
abandonment as to make the house shake
with laughter. Mr. Whitney was the ideal
Moor, his costume was perfeot and he was
in good voice, although we have
heard him sing better. He re
minded one forcibly of Othello, or
what he might make of. this great part.
Miss Burton made a darling Pedro as to
make-up; she was piquant, round and
pretty, sang and acted charmingly. Tom.
Karl did Morasqain in a highly acceptable
manner, and Miss Seigfreid was naive and
pretty a3 Paquita.
The orchestra did admiral work, and the
chorus was fine. The sextette iv the first
act was delightfully sung and the concert
ed selections by the pirates and Moors
earned smart recognition, the latter being
especially fine. :'• -"

THE PRIZE RING.
A Brutal Fight. Near Pittsburj; Yesterday-
One Hundred and Fourteen Rounds
Fought. -'Jy_~-;':: v " ■
Pittsbubg, Pa., Dec. 4.—At Ross Grove
on the West Pennsylvania railroad, nine
miles from Allegheny city, was the scene
this afternoon of one of the most brutal
and hotly contested prize fights that ever
took place in western Pennsylvania. The
principals were Patrick Morau and James
McCoy, and a hundred and fourteen
rounds were fought in one hour and thirty
six minutes. The fight has been on the
tapis several months, and was for a purse ,
of $3,000. Both men are pugilists of
some repute, McCoy having fought several '■
battles in this vicinity, while Moran par
ticipated in a number of fights in this .
country and England. McCoy is twenty- ;
seven years old and Moran fifty-ore. Ow
ing to the great difference iv their ages it
was thought the former would have an :
easy victory, and betting was two to one
in favor of McCoy. The encounter was to ',
have taken place ou Thanksgiving, but it j
was postponed for some reason and it was
generally believed to be off. This
afternoon a hundred sporting men left the
city and arrived at Ross Grove at -
3 o'clock." A ring was marked out, but no ]
ropes up, and at 3:42 time was ]
called. At the beginning McCoy broke j
his right wrist and for the rest of the bat- ]
tie fought with his left hand. Both men
appeared determined to win and were soon
oovered with blood. After McCoy broke
his wrist he fought desperately and sue- i
cseded in knocking down his antagonist a i
hundred and ten times In tho hundred {
and eleventh round, Moran got iv a ter- ' f
rific blow on McCoy's neck, felling c
him like an ox. He was picked up and a
carried to the corner bat was completely d
dazed and wanted to stop fighting, bat his \
friends prevailed on him to continue and
he fought three more rounds. Moraa
knocking him out in the hundred and
fourteenth round. Both men were.terribly *
punished and McCoy had to bo carried by »

Faribault, Minn., Deo. 4,—Milan N.
Fond was shot here to-day by Mary Swarts
the divorced wife of. George Swarts.
George Swarts procured a divorce from
her about- four weeks ago, she making no
defense. She claimed that Pond was the
cause of all her troubles, and this after
noon about 4 o'clock George took her into
his buggy and they drove to where Pond,
was at work. After some words she shot
him a little above the right hip, and he
turned to run and she shot him again, the
ball striking close to the shoulder blade
and passed over his back, making only a
flesh wound, and as she was about to fire
again the revolver was knocked from her
hand by Col. R. Williams, who arrested
her and lodged her in jail. George
Swarts was also arrested and placed in
jail. It is claimed he caused her to do the
shooting. Pond's wound is serious and

FBANK JAIIE:,' TBXAIt.
Kansas City, Mo., Nov. 4.—Frank
•James was brought from Independence
this morning and appeared in the criminal
court accompanied by his counsel. The
day for his trial for the Blue Cat train
robbery will be fixed this afternoon and
will probably be early in nary. James,
says he is enjoying his usual health.
Later.— James trial is set for Jan •
nary 14, and bail fixed at $3,000. It is
stated that James will offer a bond in a
few days and be released from custody.
The old indictment for the Blue cut rob
bery was quashed and a new one returned
of like tenor, setting forth additionally a
description of certain jewelry stolen. The
trial of Charles Ford for complicity in the
same robbery is also set for the 14th of
January.
Being interviewed on the subject, James
said he would leave the matter of offering
bail with his counsel. .If they considered
it advisable he would give a bond. Should
James be released, it is likely he will be re
arrested on some other charge, as several
indiotments stand against him in this and
other counties. . The criminal court room
was fairly crowded to-day, but no such jam
as was seen a year ago. The proceedings
are devoid of special interest.
THE MUBHAVBVILLE BIOTS.
Pittsbubg, Deo. 4.—The preliminary

the riot, and is very damaging to the pris
oners. The bearing will probably con
clude to-night.
OBGANIZED BOBBEET.
New Yoek, Dec. 4.— Some grocers' clerks.
formed the A. B. C. union for the object

it with Christian Kroze, of Brooklyn, treas
urer, the members to be given $2,500 from
the funds at the end of the year if they
wished to go into business, and if sick to
be paid $2 per day. The retail grocers
union caused the arrest of Kroze and a
number of clerks. It is said Kroze must
have received something like $7,000
from members of the society. Two "clerks
of one of the robbed grooerv stores were
to-day held for bail.
