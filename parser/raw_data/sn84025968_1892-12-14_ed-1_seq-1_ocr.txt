A FRESH CABINET CRISIS.
French Ministerial Troubles
Renewed.

By the Associated Press.
Paris, Dec. 13 —Minister of Fim.nce
Rouvier today resigned as the resul; of
a letter by Clemenceau in Figaro, im
plicating him, with Reinach and Hetz,
in the Panama canal scandal. The po
litical situation is very cri'.iciM, and
another government crlsia ia exUvin'y
likely.
Le Gaulois publishes a story in detail,
professing to give the story of the last
hours of Baron Reinach. It says after
his visit, with Clemenceau and Rouvier
to Hera, for the. purpose of getting the
papers to let up in their publication of
Panama cauai details, and finding that
Heiz would do nothing, he realized that
there was no escaping the results of bis
acts. So he went home at midnight,
wrote a number of letters, destroyed
compromising documents, and at 1
o'clock took poison.
In the deputies Rouvier confirmed the
statement by Clemenceau that he and
Reinach visited Clemenceau on the eve
of the baron's death, and that the three
visited Herz to induce him to use hie
influence to stop the attacks on Rein
ach. Herz informed them that it was
not in his power to stop the attacks, and
the .visitors left.
Paul de Roulede made a violent attack
upon Rouvier, declaring that he ought
to be compelled to appear before a court
of justice and answer the charges against
him in c mneotion with his conduct
while holding a ministerial position.
Koavirr ssld tie wes ready to answer
the charges in any court, adding that he
vLittd Reinach eolsly from motives of
humanity.
Shortly after Rouvier's visit to Presi
dent Carnot the later officially • an
nounced that the finance minister's res
ignation was accepted and that. Tirard
was appointed to succeed Rouvier.
Premier Ribot baa decided to make
the Bosserin bill a cabinet issue, and
stand or fall by the chamber's rejection
or adoption of the measure.
'iVr. c ■". ■! inveatU'Attrg <
mittee by a vote of 12 to 7 rejected
Barlhou'e proposal lhat allegations not
connected with Panama canal aff.tirs
should not be heard. It was decided,
however, to cancel all personal evi
dence.
Le Temps today says a chemical analy
sis of the viscera of Baron de Reinach
disclosed the presence of atrophine in
the organs examined. Reinach'a valet,
in testifying before the magistrate, ad
mitted that he found a bottle of poison
beside the baron's dead body.
The committee's decision to hear evi
dence not directly bearing upon the
Paunini scandal has cou-'ed great, con
sternation among the R-publican mem
bers of the chamber. A meetit.g of va
rious Republican factions has been
called for tomorrow to consider the fu
ture course of the Republicans in view
of the present agitation and unexpected
extensions of the Panama canal inquiry.
THE MONETARY CONFERENCE:
Senator Jones Makes a Ktrongj Argn-
ment fur Itl-Metaliiitiii.
Brussels, Dec. 13 —At the sitting to
day of the international monetary con
ference Sir Guildford Houldsworth, one
of the delegates representing the Indian
government, proteated against the ob
structions offered by the British dele
gates at this and previous conferences ;
that but for the tactics employed by the
representatives of Great Britain the
currency question would have been set
tled long ago. Sir Guildford declared
t at the situation in Great Biit
ain had greatly changed since
November 22d, the date of the first
meeting of the confeience, and he
suggested that the conference sdj urn
a few weeks to enable the British gov
ernment to reconsider the whol« ques
tion. He gave as the reasons for the
change in the situation in Great Biitain
the statement in favor of hi-me'aliism
made by Archbishop Wash of Dublin;
the resolutions adopted by the agricul
tural conference held a few days ago in
London, and the petitions forwarded to
the government by various chambers of
commerce.
Senator Jones made a long address on
bimetallism, reviewing the his'ory of
the question at great length. He argued
from this hißtory that tiie increase
of the silver production had led ever to
the revival of industry and com
merce. The demonetization of stiver
caused a disastrous fall in prices
throughout the civilized world. the
prosperity of every century depended up
on the stability of the value of its money.
The uninterrupted employment of the
people could be accomplished only
through the instrumentality of time
contracts, which often deferred the date
of payments many years. Any increase
in the value of the money on which the
terms of the contracts were based bore
down cruehingly upon the employers,
who saw all their foresight thwarted by
a subtle, inexplicable' power. Such
phenomena were followed by a suspen
sionof work and enterprise, and enforced
idleness upon the luborh g classes.
Senator Jones then diitted off to the
subject of checks, certificates and other
substitutes foi money. Even when
used to the utmost, Baid he, they could
bring no permanent relief to the present
situation. They were mere narcotics;
only the remonetization of silver would
be an adequate remedy.
Senator Jones was listened to with
the closest attention by the conference.

FOSTER ANSWERS FOSTER.
Aii International Cabinet
Controversy.
The Canadian Finance Minister
Taken to Task.
His Strictures on the President's
Message Criticised.
The American Secretary <,r State Defends
the Policy or His Country as
Regard* Treaty Relations
With Canada.
By the Associated Press.
Washington, Dec. 13.—The attention
of Secretary of State Foster was today
called to a lengthy interview with Cana
dian Finance Minister Foster tele
graphed from Ottawa, in which the
Canadian severely criticises President
Harrison's annual message with refer
ence to Canada. Speaking of the reci
procity matter, Secretary Foster said :
"During the conference last winter
Mr. Blame did not insist on a uniform
tariff for both countries, but did ask that
the schedule should not be confined to
natural products, but include an agreed
list of manufactured goods.
"The fisheries question has covered
more than a century of voluminous dis
cussion and prolonged controversy, but
the most limited examination of it
shows that at every Btep in its history
the exacting and unreasonable demands
of Canada have frustrated otherwise
harmonious adjustments between Great
Britain and the United States. This is
especially noticeable in the fur seal con
troversy. It is a well-known fact that
in 18S8 the subject; had reached a com
plete basis nf settlement in London be
tween Lord Salisbury and Minister
Ptielpp, when Canada's remonstrances
defeated the arrangement and precipita
ted the two governments into a bitter
discuFsion out of which has gro?,n the
Beting sea ai bit.ration."
"Canada's statement of the issue in
volved in the controversy is also mis
leading," said Secretary Foster. "It is
not a question of free fishing on the
high seas. The government of the
United States does not claim that the
Bering sea in a mare clausam, and
does not seek to restrict the legitimate
freedom of the ocean; but in the lan
guage of Mr. Blame, it does claim that
the law of the sea is not lawless. It
holds that fur seals born and reared on
the Priby loffislanOs.on which they spend
a large part af their existence, and to
which they return with unvarying in
rti ct, represent a large u>.l valuable
industry which should not be permitted
to be exterminated by the inhuman
methods of the Canadian poachers.
"The Canadian minister cloudß the
canal controversy by shifting the real
ground to an alleged comparison of the
relative advantages the two countries
derive from each other's concessions
under the treaty of Washington in the
matter of navigation. The whole move
ment is evidently dssigned to force the
United States to yield to Canada free
navigation of the Hudson river, a con
cession which waa left unconsidered in
the conference which led up to the
treaty of Washington. Ttie navigation
of Like Michigan by the Canadians was
made then an express equivalent to the
navigation of tho St. Lawrence river.
Every attempt to brinu; about a better
understanding of canal tolls has been
met by the demand of Canada that the
free navigation of the Hudson river be
thrown in by the United ' States as
the price of Canada's fulfillment of the
simple terms of the treaty of Washing
ton. All nations have carefully guarded
their internal avenues oi communication
and coastwise commerce from foreign
intrusion, and the president has neither
the inclination nor the power to pay tho
price of its surrender in this instance to
secure the observance by Canada of
what he regards as plain treaty obliga
tions."
Secretary Foster also devotes some
space to Canada's attitude toward our
railway traffic, and says: "Our tolera
tion of the Canadian railroad system's
operations has thus far been" one of
many instances of the forbearance of
the executive, and a disti iguisbed mark
of our desire to cultivate friendiv rela
tions with Canada."

UNSUCCESSFUL HOLD-UP.
FOUK MEN TRY TO KOB A VBS-
TIBULE TIiAIN,
A Terrible Scene of Confusion Ensues.
One I'aßgengor Mortally and An
other Seriously Wouuded
by the Bandits.
Huntington, W. Va., Deo. 13—As the
Chesapeake and Ohio veetibuled train
pulled out of this city last night four
masked train robbers, with two, pistolß
each, appeared and ordered the passen
gers to hold up their hands. Two pas
sengers seized one of the robbers. In
the scuffle one passenger, a German from
Cincinnati, nn Ha wedding trip, was
mortally wounded, and Peter Drake,
also of Cincinnati, wounded twice. The
conductor secured a revolver and imp
tied it twice at the robbers.
Meantime the scene was one of inde
scribable confusion; passengers were
biding beneath the seats and women
were screaming and faiuiing. At last
the robbers, realizing that the job was a
failure, stopped the train, jumped off
and disappeared in the darkness. It is
believed some of them were wounded.
At 9 o'clock tonight detectives arrcßted
the first man alleged to have been con
nected with the train robbery. He is
Burwell Furgey, a man who was shot,
as he alleges, in his own doorway soon
after the attack on the train, when he
went out, to drive tome supposed prowl
ers off his premises. The appearance of
Furgev tallies in almost, every detail
with the description of the taller of the
two robbers.
