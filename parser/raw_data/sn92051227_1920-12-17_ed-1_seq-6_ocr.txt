A CASE FORTHE REGULATOR
IT IS EVIDENT that Representa

ber of Congress from Minnesota,
needs, regulating, and needs it badly.
Not only is he guilty of haying heret
ical opinions about political matters
but he is trying to get them muui
po rated into law.
He has introduced a bill into Con
gress wheh, if passed, would require
presidential candidates, at least six
months before the nominating pri
maries to define to the country Just
;where they stood on questions of gov
ernmental policies.
What is the matter with Represen
tative Schall? Did he never hear of
Marlon 'and the d.'atlnguisred occu
pant of ts famous front porch? Does
he not know that the next occupant
of the White House was elected by
one of the biggest votes in .the his
tory of the country on a platform not
knowing what he would, or wanted,
to do? i." V i ,
. Has the gentleman from Minnesota
failed to "note that" at the present
time there is a procession , of disin
rulshed gentlemen passing tnrough
Marlon and stopping long enough to
give a little aid to the President-elect
In his search for an opinion?
What then does he mean by trying
to pass a law to oblige a Republican
candidate to tell what he wants to
do? Does he not know that it is only

the Democrats who know what they
are trying to do and that the Repub
licans are still trying to find v out
what they want to try to accomplish?

had dragged himself to the hallway.

dered himself. He was immediately
taken under severe examination at
the hands of half a dozen detectives.
The police later arrested- two men
and a woman in connection with the
killing of Lieut. Horton. The arrests
followed discovery in the Bronx of a

the bandits are believed to have fled

To be a leper was to he an outcast
beyond hope of any solace but the
grave. t
All the larger towns in Europe had
a place especially set , apart for its
lepers. This reservation was shun
ned as though it were the door of
Hell itself. A boundary line was
drawn beyond which no leper eoiild
venture except at the risk of Instant
death. If a healthy stranger Unwit

camp he was remoselessly thrust Into
it and made to share the lot of the
Inmates.
During the night the miserable
creatures crawled , to some exposed
hill and secured the food which hal
been left for them there during the
day, food which was furnished by
the town authorities.
Cases abounded in the sparsely set
tled districts and their condition was
even worse than those near the towns.
Compelled to wrap themselves in
sheets so that onjy the eyes were ex

they could on roots, berries, and the

'where they could get it by some one
with a little tenderer heart than the
average. They were obliged to car
ry a small bell and ring it to warn
people of their approach and it need
ed only the dismal tinkle of the lep

This terrible disease has been slow

these were in China. There have

In the winter Miss Mary Daniels lives
at 1163 Steel street, Denver.
Events leading up to Miss Daniels'
dlsa-ppearance follow;
A month before she went away
she wrote Miss Euphemla Drysda-le,
a college, chum;
"My nose has been. to the grind
stone. Bills have piled around me,
but now that Mary Is settled on her
farm, I 'am hopeful for a much
brighter future. Some day I hope to
Join Mary out west."
Three weeks before her disappear
ance, Miss Daniels had been the
guest at the home of Mrs, Ludwig
Elsonman, wealthy Baack Bay resi
dent. She appeared tired and took a va
cation from her duties.
During her stay at Mrs. Elsen
man's it developed Miss Daniels re
turned to Mrs. Charles Moser the
sum of $60 which she, was holding as
a burial fund for her aged friend,
Thursday morning (Thanksgiving
Day) Miss Daniels went to church
with Mrs. Eisenmari. She left Mrs.
Eisenman to go to ' her own apart
ment to take dinner with Mrs. Marie
Leclair, a .Christian Science practi
tioner with whom she had her home.
Instead Miss Daniels telephoned Mrs.
Leclair that she conld not keep a
dinner engagement with her and two
Dana Hall students: that she wanted
to be alone. .
Friday, Miss Daniels rested at Mrs.
Eisenman's house all day. She told
a member of the Eisenman's family
that she ate Thanksgiving Day dinner
at one of a downtown chain of res
taurants and attended the matinee at
a theatre. . Investigators have sought
in vain to learn why the young
woman wished to be away from her
closest friends on that day and if
she really died alone.
Saturday Miss Daniels resumed her
work at Mr. Merritt's office a.nd in the
afternoon returned to her own apart
ment. She was perfectly normal.
Sunday Miss Daniels went to
church twice with Mrs. Leclair. Ar
riving home after the evening service
th etwo women talked until 9:30
o'clock when they retired to their
rooms.
Monday morning Mrs. Leclair found
Miss Daniels had not slept in her bed.
The only things missing from her
room were a brown business suit, a
change of underwear ,a suit case, a
dark coat, a n old coat and a black
fur niece.
Miss Daniels had torn up a score
of letters and photographs and left
them in the waste basket.
On her desk Miss Daniels left a
note addressed to Mrs. Le Clair. Mrs.
Tye Clair has refused to make public
this "mystery note." She explains
that the missive was a private one
and would help in no Way to solve
the mysterious disappearance of her
friend with whom she had lived for
eleven years.
The letter asked that a table be re
turned to Miss Nellie Malloon, a
friend. There were several other
nieces of furniture which Miss Dan

BRIEFS
Fire of unknown origin totally de

early yesterday morning. When dis
covered, the flames had gained such
headway that efforts to save the
building were useless.
.'"'In this critical : period in the Irish
struggle for independence, it becomes
necessary to the friends of that move
ment ; to seek the utmost attainable
unity-r unity , of. belief , unity of prop-i
aganda and unity of action.
-1 is true that , no movement ever
did - exist which commanded comnlete
adherence of all its friends. The goal
to be sought is. only the maxuiim
that can be attained. , ' .
It is true - that : no movement ever
established -which:, is represented in
America by President De Valera, an
ahle and conscientious man who has
made hosts of friends for his cause
since he came. -
President De Valera says that the
British government has been super-a-d
in Ireland, that a republic has
been established there, that this re
publican government is the actiaully
governing force in Ireland, that the
people are rendering obedience to its
cr.mr.--ar-.ds. and that the British gov
ernment is merely an armed inter
loper whose forces are upon Irish"
soil without . any authority, or legal
ity. . , :. .,
.The government of which De Val
era is the head has declared war
upon Great Britain and Is levying
war by certain acts of violence di
rected against persons h the British
service and against the property of
the British crown. Lloyd George ap
parently admits this state of war, and
operating through forces of the Brit
ish crown has committel reprisals
against the life of the Irish repub
licans and against the property of the
Irish people. There being a state of
war, it naturally follows that there
are killings and that there is des
truction of property, and in this war,
as in every war, the state of , the com
bat tends to be measured in terms
of these acts.
Yet, as the thought of Mr. De
Valera's adherents in America is
scrutinized, tiiere is discovered a
marked lack of unity, of understand
ing mm to what the Sinn Fein gov
ernment is doing, as to what its pur
poses are.
One group find-s it policy to publish
and magnify the acts of war which
are committed by the forces of the
republic, but 'the other group, in ap
parent misunderstanding of the tac
tics of the movement, seems to min
imize and even to deny those circum
stances by which the Irish people
siek to achieve independence.
If It is war and it is being car
ried on after the fashion and meth
od of war, it would seem to be pol
icy to -exhibit to the last magnitude
all of those facts by which the Sinn
Fein government exhibits its author
ity. ' . '
It is only if there is not a war that
H can be regarded as policy to min
imize these acts, or to say that' they
do not occur.
This lack of unity is rather clearly
exhibited in the attitude which is
taken over the so-called Union Club
demonstration. This demonstration
was of the -same nature as a multi
plicity of - demonstrations which were
pictured by the militant women of
Great Britain, and in a lesser degree
by the militant suffragists of Amer
ica during the war. '
The purpose of the women was to
advertise to the world that they were
determined to do away with what
then reerardod as injut'ee. There were
so many advertisements of the de
termined will of the leadership of the
women to secure . feminine equality.
