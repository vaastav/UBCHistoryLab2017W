PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Return to a Specie Basis
Advised.
Amicable Relations with Foreign
Powers.
Expatriation and the Tariff
Questions.
IV a gnat mod Bomt f tnmlmtmm:
Since the conyening of Congress, one
year ago, the Nation haa undergone a
prostration in business and industries
auch has not been witnessed with us
fox many yean. Speculation as to the
causes for this prostration might be in
dulged in without profit, because as
many theories would be advanced as
there would be independent writers,
who expressed their own views, without
borrowing, upon the subject. Without
indulging in the theories as to the cause
of this prostration, I will only call your
attention to the feet, -and one question,
as to which it would seem there should
be no disagreement. During this pros
tration two essential elements of prosper
ity hare been most abundant labor and
capital. Both have been largely unem-
ployed where security has been undoubt
ed. Capital has been attainable at very
moderate rates. Where labor has been
wanted, it has been found in abundance,
at cheap rates, compared with what of
necessaries and comforts of life could be
purchased with the wages demanded.
Two great elements of pra"perity there
fore, have not been dented us. A third
might be added our soil and climate
are unequaled within the limits of any
contiguous territory, under one national
ity, for its variety of prod nets to feed
and clothe people, and in the amount of
surplus to spare to feed less favored people.-
Therefore, with these facts in view,
it seems to me that wise statesmanship at
this session of Congress would dictate
the ignoring of the past, and the di
recting in the proper channels these
great element of prosperity.
The debt abroad is the only element
that can, with always a sound currency,
enter into our affairs to cause any con
tinued depression in the industries and
prosperity of our people a great conflict
for national existence made necessary,
for tempo rv purposes, the raising of large
sums of money from whatever source at
tainable. It became necessary, in the
wisdom of Congress, and I do not doubt
their wisdom in the premises, regarding
the necessity or the times, to devise a
system of national currency, which it
proved to be impossible to keep on a par
with the recognized cmrency of the civ
ilized world. This begat a spirit of spec
ulation, including an extravagance ana
luxury not required for the happiness or
prosperity of a people, and involving.
both directly and indirectly, foreign in
debtedness, ibe currency Deing oi a
fluctuating value, and therefore unsafe
to hold for legitimate transactions, money
became a subject of speculation in itself.
These two cases, however, have involved
us in a foreign indebtedness, contracted
in good faith by the borrower and lender,
which should be paid in coin, and, ac
cording to the bond agreed upon when
the debt was contracted, gold or its
equivalent The good faith of the Gov
ernment can not be violated toward
creditors at the expense of national dis
grace. Our commerce should be encour
aged. American ship building and carry
ing greatly increased. Foreign markets
- aoncjfat for the products of the soil and
manufactures, to the end that we may be
able to pay these debts. Where a market
can be created for the sale of our pro
ducts, either of the soil, the mine, or the
manufactory, a new means is discovered
of utilizing our idle capital and labor to
the advantage of the whole people, But
in my judgment the first step toward this
object is to secure a currency good wher
ever civilization reigns one which, if it
becomes superabundant with one people,
will find a market with some other. A
currency which has as its basis the labor
necessary to produce it, which will give
it its value. . Gold and silver are now
the recognized mediums of exchange the
civilized world over, and to this we should
return with the least practicable delay.
In view of the pledges of the Ameri
can Congress, when our present legal
tender system was adopted, and the debt
contracted, there should be no delay,
certainly no unnecessary delay, in fix
ing by legislation a method by which we
will return to specie. To the accom
plishment of this end I invite your spec
ial attention. I believe firmly that
there can be no prosperous and perman
ant revival of business and industries
until a polhy is adopted, with legisla
tion to can it out, leading to a return
to specie basis. It is easy to conceive
that the debtor and speculative basis
may think it of value to them to make
so-called money abundant, until they
can throw a portion of their burdens
upon others; but even these I believe,
would be disappointed in the result, if a
course should be pursued which will
keep in doubt the value of the legal ten
der medium of exchange. A revival of
productive industries is needed by all
classes, and by none more than the hold
ers of property, of whatever sort, with
debts to bquioate for realization upon
its sales. But admitting that these two
classes of citizens are to be benefitted by
expansion, would it be honest to give it?
Would not the general loss be too great
to justify such relief T Would it not be
just as honest and prudent to authorize
each debtor to issue his own legal ten
ders to the extent of his liabilities, as to
do this? Would it not be safer for fear
of over issue by unscrupulous creditors,
to say that all debt obligations are ob
literated in the -United States, and now
we commence anew, each possessing all
he has at the time, free from incum-
brance T These propositions are too ab
surd to be entertained for a moment by
thinking people. Every delay in the
preparation of final resumption partakes
of this dishonesty, and is only less in de
gree as the proposition is held out that a
convenient season will at last arrive for
the good work of redeeming our pledges
to commerce. It will never come, in my
opinion, except by positive action of
Congress or by national . disas
ters, which will destroy for a
time at least, the credit of individ
uals and the State at large. A sound
currency must be reached by the total
bankiuptcy of the credit and the integ
rity of the nation and individuals. I
believe it is in the power of Congress,
at this session, to devise such legis
lation as will restore confidence,
Tevive all the industries, start us at the
career of prosperity, and save the credit
of the nation and of the people. Steps
toward the return to a specie basis are
the great requisites to this, devoutly to
be sought for consummation, and there
are others, which I may touch upon here
after. A nation dealing in a currency
below that of specie in value, labors
under two great disadvantages: First,
having no use for the world's acknowl
edged medium of exchange, gold aad
silver, these are driven out of the coun
try because there is no demand for their
use. Second, the medium of exchange
being of a fluctuating value, for after
all it is only worth jnst what it will pur
chase of gold and silver metals, hiving
an intrinsic value just in proportion to
the honest labor it takes to produce them.
A large1 margin must be allowed for
profit by the manufacturer and producer.
It is months from the date of production
to the date of realization. Interest upon
capital must be charged,-and tbe risk of
fluctuation in the value of that which
is to be received in payment added;
hence high prices, acting as a protection
to the foreign producer, who receives
nothing in exchange for the product of
his skill and labor, except a currency
good at a stable value the world over.
It seems to me that nothing is clearer
than that the greater part of the burden
of the existing prostration, for the want
of a sound financial system, falls upon
the working man, who must, after all.
produce the wealth, and on the salaried
man who superintends and conducts the
business. The burden fells upon them
in two ways by the deprivation of em
ployment, and by the decreased purchas
ing power of their salaries. It is the
duty of Congress to devise the method
of correcting the evils which are acknowl
edged to exist, and not mine ; but I will
venture to suggest two or three things
which seem to me as absolutely necessary
to a return to specie payments. The first
great requisite is a return to prosperity.
The legal tender clause to ,the law, au
thorizing the issue of currency by the
National Government should be repealed.
to take effect as to all contracts entered
into after a day fixed in tbe repealing
act ; not to apply, however, to the pay
ment ef salaries by the Government, or
other expenses, now provided by law, to
be paid in currency. In the interval
pending between repeal and final re
sumption, provision should be made by
which the Secretary of the Treasury can
obtain gold as it may become necessary,
from time to time, from the date when
specie resumption is commenced. To
this might and should be added a revenue
sufficiently in excess of expenses, to in
sure an accumulation of gold in the
Treasury to sustain redemption. I com
mend this subject to your careful con
sideration, believing that a favorable
solution is attainable, and that, if reached
by this Congress, that the present and
future generations will ever gratefully
remember it as their deliverance from a
thraldom of evil and disgrace. With
resumption, free banking may be author
ized with safety, giving full protection to
bill-holders, which they have under the
existing laws. Indeed I would regard
free banking as essential. It would give
a proper elasticity to the currency. As
more currency should be required for the
transaction of legitimate business, new
banks would be started; and, in turn,
banks would wind up their business
when it was found that there was a super
abundance of currency. The experience
and judgment of the people can best de
cide just how much currency is required
for the transaction of the business of the
country. It is unsafe to leave the settle
ment of this question to Congress, the
Secretory of the Treasnry, or the Exec
utive. Congress should make the reg
ulations under which banks may exist,
but should not make banking a monopoly,
by limiting the amount ot redeemable
paper currency that shall be authorized.
Such importance do I attach to this sub
ject, and so earnestly do I commend it to
your attention, thatl give it prominence
by introducing it at the beginning of this
message.
During the past year nothing has oc
curred to disturb the general friendly
and cordial relations of the United States
with other powers. The correspondence,
submitted herewith, between this Gov
ernment and its diplomatic representa
tives of other countries, are satisfactory
as to the condition of all questions be
tween the United States and the most
of those countries; and with few excep
tions, to which reference is hereafter
made, the absence of any points of differ
ence to be adjusted. The notice directed,
by the resolution of Congress, of June 17,
1874. to be given to terminate the Con
vention of July 17, 1858, between the
United States and Belgium, has been
given, and the treaty will accordingly
terminate on the first day of July, 1875.
This convention secured to certain Bel
gian vessels entering the ports of the
United States exceptional privileges,
which are not accorded to our own ves
sels. Other features of the Convention
have proved satisfactory, and have
tended to the cultivation of mutually
beneficial commercial intercourse and
friendly relations between the two coun
tries. I hope that the negotiations which
have been invited will result in the cele
bration of another treaty which may
tend to the benefit of both countries.
Our relations with China continue to
be friendly. During the past year, the
fear of hostilities between China and
Japan, growing out of the landing of an
armed force upon the Island of Formosa
by the latter, has occasioned uneasiness.
It is earnestly hoped, however, that the
difficulties arising from this cause will
be adiuHted. and that the advance of
civilization in these two empires may not
be retarded by a state of war. In con
sequence of the part taken by certain
citizens ot the United States in this ex
pedition, our representatives in these
countries have been instructed to impress
upon the Governments of China and
Lfapan the firm intention of this country
v maintain a strict neutrality iu uic
event of hostilities, and carefully prevent
any infraction of the law on the part of
our citizens, in connection witn wis
subject, I call the attention of Congress
to a generally conceded fact, that the
great proportion of Chinese immigrants,
who come to our shore, do not come
voluntarily to make their homes with us.
and their labor productive of general
prosperity, but come under a contract
with head men who own them almost
absolutely. In a worse form does this
apply to Chinese women. Hardly a
perceptible percent of them perform any
honorable labor, but they are brought for
shameful purposes to the disgrace of the
communities were settled, to the great
demoralization of the youth of those
localities. If this bad practice can be
legislated against, it will be my pleasure as
well as my duty to enforce any regulation
to secure so desirable an end.
It is hoped that negotiations between
the Government of Japan and the other
powers, looking to the further opening of
the empire, and to ine removal oi various
restrictions upon trade and travel, may
soon produce the results desired, which
can not fail to inure to tbe benefit of all
parties. Having on previous occasions
submitted to the consideration of Con-
5ress the propriety of the release of the
apanese Government from the further
payment of indemnity, under tne con
vention of October &2, 1864, and as no
action had been taken therein, it became
my duty to regard the obligations of the
Convention as in force ; and as the other
powers interested having received their
portion of the indemnity in full, the
Minister of the United States in Japan
has been notified that this Government
has not received the remainder due to
the United States under the Convention
ofSimonsky. I submit the propriety of
applying the income of a part, if not the
whole, of this fund to the educatian
in the Japanese language of a number
of young men to be under obligations
to serve the Government for a specified
time as interpreters at the legation and
the consulates in Japan. A limited num
ber of Japanese youths might, at the same
time, be educated in our vernacular, and
would result to the mutual advantage of
both Governments. The importance of
having our own citizens competent and
familiar with the language or Japan, to
act as interpreters, and in other capaci
tices connected with the legations and
consulatesin that country, cannot readily
be over-estimated.
The amount awarded to the Govern
ment of Great Britain by the mixed Com
mission, organized under the acts of the
treaties of Washington, in settlement of
the claims of British subjects, arising
from acts committed between April 18,
1841, and April 9, 1865, became practic
able under the terms of the treaty with
in the past year and was paid upon the
21st day of September, 1874. In this
connection I renew, my recommendation,
made at the opening of the last session of
(JongresB, that a special court be created
to hear and determine all claims of aliens
against the United States, arising from
acts committed against their persons or
property during the insurrection. It
appears equitable that opportunity should
be offered for persons of other States to
present their claims, as well as to those
British subjects whose claims were not
admissible under the late Commission, to
the early decision of a competent tribu
nal, and I recommend the necessary leg
islation to organize a court to dispose of
those claims of aliens wno are referred to
it in an equitable and satisfactory man
ner. and to relieve Congress and the de
partments from the consideration of
these questions. -The
legislation necessary to extend to
,
the Colony of New Foundland certain
articles of the Treaty of Washington, of
the 8th day of May, 1870, having been
had, a protocol to that effect was sug
gested in behalf of the United States and
Great Britain, on the 28th of May last,
and was duly proclaimed on the follow
ing day.
A copy of the proclamation is sub
mitted nerewith, and a copy of the re
port of the Commissioner appointed un
der the act of March 19, 1872, for survey
ing and marking the boundary between
the United States and the British Pos
sessions, from the Lake of the Woods to
the summit of the Kocky Mountains, is
herewith transmitted. I am happy to
announce that the field work of the
Commission has been completed, and the
entire line, from the northwest corner of
Lake of the Woods to the summit or tbe
Rocky Mountains has been run and
marked upon the surface of the earth.
It is believed that the amount remaining
unexpended of the appropriation made
at the last session of Congress, will be
sufficient to complete the work. I re
commend that the authority of Congress
be given to the use of the unexpended
balance ot the appropriation in the com
pletion of the work of the Commission,
in making the report and printing the
necessary map.
The court known as the Court of Com
missioners of Alabama Claims, created
by an act of Congress during the last
session, has been organized and has com
menced its work ; it is to be hoped that
the claims admissable under the provis
ions of the act may be speedily adminis
tered. It has been deemed advisable to exer
cise the discretion conferred upon the
Executive at the last session, by accept
ing the conditions required by the Gov
ernment of Turkey, for the privilege of
allowing citizens of the United States to
hold real estate in the former country,
ard by assenting to a certain change of
the jurisdiction of the Courts in the lat
ter. A copy of the proclamation upon
these subjects ig herewith communicated.
There has been no material change in
our relations with the independent
States of this hemisphere, which were
formerly under the dominance of Spain.
Marauding on the frontiers between Mex
ico and Texas, still frequently takes
place, despite the vigilance of the civil
and military authorities in that quarter.
The difficulty of checking snch trespasses
along the course of a river of such
length as the Rio Grande, and so often
fordable, is obvious. It is hoped that the
efforts of this Government will be sec
onded by those of Mexico to the effectual
suppression of acts of wrong.
From a report upon the condition of
the business before the American and
Mexican Joint Claims Commission made
by the agent on the part of the United
States, and dated October 28, 1874, it ap
pears that of the 1,107 claims filed on
the part of citizens of the United States,
483 had been finally decided, and 75
were in the hands of the umpire, leaving
460 to be disposed of. Of the 998 claims
filed against the United States, 726 had
been finally decided upon. One was be
fore the umpire, and 271 remain to be
disposed of. Since the date of such re
port, other claims have been disposed of,
reducing somewhat 'the number still
pending; others have been passed upon
fey the arbitrators,
"it has become apparent in view of
these figures, and of the fact that the
work devolving on the Umpire is partic
ularly laborious; that the commission
would be unable to dispose of the entire
number of claims pending prior to the
first day of February, 1875, the date
fixed for its expiration. Negotiations
were pending looking to the security of
the results of the decisions which have
been reached and to a further extension
of the commission for a limited time,
which it is confidently hoped will suffice
to bring all the business now before it to
a final clone.
The strife in the- Argentine Republic
is to be deplored, both on account of the
parties thereto, and from the probable
e fleets on the interests of the trade in
that quarter, the United States being
among the principal loosers as yet So
far as I am aware there has been no
violation of our neutrality rights, which
as well as our duties in that respect, it
shall bemy endeavor to maintain and
observe. " It is with regret that I an
nounce that no further payment has
been received from the Government of
Venezuela, on account of wars in favor
of citizens of the United States.
Hopes have been entertained that if
the republic could escape both foreign
and civil war for a few years, its great
natural resources would enable it to hon
or its obligations.
Though it is now understood to be at
peace with other countries, a serious in
surrection is reported to be in progress
in an important region of that republic.
This may be taken advantage of as an
other reason to delay the payment of the
dues of our citizens.
The deplorable Btrife in Cuba continues
without any marked change in the rela
tive advantages of the contending forces.
The insurrection continues, but Spain
has gained no superiority.
Six years of strife give the insurrection
a significance which can not be deterred.
Its duration and the tenacity of its ad
herence, together with the absence of
manifested power of. suppression on the
part of Spain, can not be controverted,
and may make some positive steps on the
part of the other powers a matter of self
necessity. I had confidently hoped at
this time to be able to announce the ar
rangements of some of the important
questions between this Government and
that of Spain, but the negotiations have
been protracted.
The unhappy intestine dissensions of
Spain command our profound sympathy,
and must be accepted as, perhaps, a cause
of some delay ; an early settlement, in
part at least, of the questions between
the Governments, is hoped. In the mean
time, awaiting the results of the imme
diately pending negotiations, I defer a
further and fuller communication on the
subject of the relations of this country
and Spain.
I have again to call the attention of
Congress to the unsatisfactory condition
of the existing laws with reference to
expatriation and the election of nation
ality. Formerly, amid conflicting opin
ions and decisions, it was difficult to
exactly determine how far the doctrine
of perpetual allegiance was applicable to
citizens of the United States.
Congress, by the act of the 27th ofj
July, 1868, asserted the abstract right ofl
expatriation as a fundamental principle
of this Government Notwithstanding
such assertion, and that the necessity of
frequent application of the principle,
no legislation has been had defining
what acts or formalities shall work ex
patriation, or when a citizen shall be
deemed to have renounced, or to have
lost his citizenship. The importance of
such definition is obvious. The repre
sentatives of the United States in foreign
countries are continually called upon to
lend their aid and the protection of the
United States to persons, concerning the
good faith or the reality of whose citi
zenship there is at least great question.
In some cases the provisions of the trea
ties furnish some guide. In others it
seems to be left to the persons claiming
the benefit of citizenship, while living
in a foreign country, contributing in no
manner to the performance of the obli
gations and duties of a citizen of the
United States, simply as a shield from
the performance of the obligations of
citizens elsewhere.
The status of children born of Amer
ican parents residing in a foreign coun
try, of American women who have mar
ried aliens, of American citizens resid
ing abroad, where such question is not
regulated by treaty, are all sources of
frequent difficulty and discussion. '
Legislation on these and similar ques
tions, particularly defining when, and
under what circumstances expatriation
can be accomplished, or can be presumed,
is especially needed.
In this connection, I earnestly call the
attention of Congress to the difficulties
arising from fraudulent naturalization.
The United States wisely, freely and
liberally offers its citizenship to all who
may come in good faith to reside within
its limits, on their complying with cer
tain prescribed, reasonable and simple
formalities and conditions. Among the
highest duties of the Government is to
afford firm, efficient and equal protec
tion to all its citizens, whether na
tive born or naturalized. Care should
be taken that a right carrying with such
support from the Government should not
be fraudulently obtained, and should be
bestowed only upon full proof of a com
pliance with the law. There are frequent
instances of illegal and frandulent nat
uralization and of the unauthorized use
of certificates thus improperly obtained.
In some cases the fraudulent character of
the naturalization of a person has ap
peared upon the face of the certificate
itself; in others, examination discloses
that the holder had not complied with
the law, and in others certificates have
been obtained where the persons holding
them, not only were not entitled to be
naturalized, but had not even been within
the United States at the time of the pre
tended naturalization. Instances of each
of these classes of frauds are discovered
at our legations, where the certificates of
naturalization are presented either for
the purpose of obtaining passports or in
demanding the protection of the legation.
When the fraud is plain on the faces of
suchjeertificates they are taken up by
the representatives of the Government
and forwarded to the department of the
State. But even the record of the Court,
in which the fraudulent naturalization
occurred, remains, and duplicate certif
icates are readily obtainable upon the
presentation of these for the issue of pass
ports or the demanding of the protection
of the Government The fraud some
times escapes notice, and such certificates
are not unfrequently used in the tran
sactions of business to the injury of in
nocent parties, without placing any ad
ditional obstacle in the way of the
obtainment of citizenship by the worthy
and well intentioned foreigner who comes
in good faith, not without I earnestly
recommend further legislation to prevent
fraudulent naturalization and to secure
the ready cancellation of the record of
every naturalization made in irauu.
Since my last annual message exchange
has been made of the ratification ot
treaties of extradition with Belgium,
Equador, Peru, Salvador; also of a treaty
of commerce and navigation with Peru,
and one of commerce and consular privi
leges with Salvador, all of which have
been dnlv proclaimed, as also a declara
tion with Russia in reference to trade
marks. The report of the Secretary of the
Treasurv. which, bv law, is made directly
to Congress, and forms no part of this
message, will show the recipts and ex
penditures for the fiscal year, and the
amount received from each source of
revenue, and the amount paid out for
each of the departments of Government
It will be observed from this report that
the amount of receipts over expenditures
has been but $2,344,882.30 for the fiscal
year ending June 80, 1874, and that for
the current fiscal year the estimated re
ceipts over expenditures will not much
exceed nine millions of dollars. In view
of the large national debt existing, and
the obligations to add one per cent per
annum to the sinking fund, a sum
amounting now to over $34,000,000 per
annum. I submit whether the revenues
should not be reduced er the expendi
tures diminished, to reach this amount
of surplus. Not to provide for this sink
ing fund is a partial failure to comply
with the contracts and obligations of the
Government At the last session of
Congress a very considerable reduction
was made in the rates of taxation and in
the number of articles submitted to tax
ation. The question may well be asked
whether or not in Borne instances un
wisely. In connection with this subject,
too, I am of the opinion that the means
of collecting the revenues, especially
from imports, have been so embarrassed
by legislation as to make it questionable
whether or not large amounts are not
lost by the failure to collect, to the di
rect loss of the Treasury, to the prejudice
of the interest of honest importers, and
tax payers.
The Secretary of the Treasury, in his
report favors legislation looking to specie
payments, thus supporting the views
Ereviously expressed in this message,
e also recommends economy in the ap
propriations, and calls attention to the
loss of revenue from repealing the tax
on tea and coffee, without benefit to the
consumer. He recommends an increase
of ten cents a gallon on whisky, and
further that no modification be made in
the Banking and Currency Bill passed at
the last session of Congress, unless the
modification should become necessary by
reason of the adoption of measures for
returning to specie payments. In these
recommendations I cordially join.
I would suggest to Congress the pro
priety of readjusting the tariff, so as to
increase the number of articles upon
which duties are levied. Those articles
which enter into our manufactures, and
are not produced at home, it seems to me
should be entered free ; those articles of
manufactures which we produce, con
stitute part of but do not produce the
whole, that part which we do not pro
duce should enter free also. I will in
stance fine wool dyes, etc. These must
be imported to form a part of the manu
facture of the higher grades of woolen
sroods. and chemicals used as dves. com
pounded in medicines, and used in vari
ous ways in manufactures, come under
this class. The introduction tree ot the
dyes of such wools as we do not produce
should stimulate the manufacturer of
goods reauiring these that we do pro
duce, and therefore would be a benefit
te home production. There are many
articles entering into home manufac
tures, which we do not produce oursblves,
the tariff upon which increases the cost
of producing the manufactured article.
All corrections in this regard are in the
direction of bringing labor and capital
in harmony with each other, and of sup
plying one of the elements much needed.
The report of the Secretary of War,
herewith attached, and forming a part of
this message, gives all the information
concerning the operations, wants, and
necessities of his department, and con
tains many suggestions and recommenda
tions which I commend to your' special
attention. There is no class of Govern
ment employes who are harder worked
than the army officers, and none who
perform their tasks more cheerfully and
more efficiently, and undeT circumstances
of greater privations and hardships, leg
islation is desirable to render more effi
cient this branch of the public service.
All the recommendations of the Secretary
of War I regard as judicious, and espec
ially commend to your attention the lol
lowing: The consolidation of Govern
ment arsenals ; mileage to officers, trav
eling under orders; the exemption of
money received from the sale of sub
sistence stores, from being converted into
the Treasury ; the use of appropriations
for the purpose of subsistence, without
waiting tor the beginning ot the hscal
year, for which the appropriations are
made ; for additional appropriations for
the collection of torpedo material: for
increased appropriations for the manu
factureof arms; for relieving the various
States from indebtedness, for arms
charged to them during the rebellion;
for dropping officers from the rolls of the
army without trial, for the offense of
drawing pay more than once for the same
period: for the discouragement of the
plan to pay soldiers by checks ; and for
the establishment of a professorship of
rhetoric and .hnglish literature at West
Point
The reasons for the recommendations
are obvious, and are set forth sufficiently
in the report attached. Ialso recommend
that the status of the staff corps of the army
be fixed, where this has not already been
done, so that promotions may be made
and vacancies filled as they occur in each
grade. When reduced below the number
to be fixed by the necessity for such leg
islation, is especially felt now in the Pay
Department The number of vacancies
in that department is below the number
adequate to the performance of the du

The efficiency of the Navy has been
largely increased during the last year,
under the impulse of tbe foreign com
plications which threatened us. At the
commencement of the last session of
Congress, most of our efficient wooden
ships put in condition for immediate
service, and the repairs of our iron-clad
fleet were pushed with the utmost vigor.
The result is that m6st of these are now
in an effective state, and need only to be
manned and put iu commission, to go at
once into service. Some of the new
sloops authorized by Congress are- al
ready in commission, and inost of the
remainder are launched and wait only
the completion of machinery to enable
them to take their places as part of our
effective force. Two iron torpedo ships
have been completed during the last
year, and four of our large double-tur-
reted iron clads are unaergoing repairs.
When these are finished everything that
is needful to our navy, as now author
ized, will be in condition forservice, and
with the advance in the science of tor
pedo warfare, the American navy, com
paratively small as it is, will be found
powerful for the purposes of a peaceful
Nation.
Much has also been accomplished dur
ing the year n aid of science, and to in
crease the sum of general knowledge and
further the interests oi commerce ana
civilization. Extensive and much needed
soundings have been made for hydro
eranhic cm-noses, and to fix the proper
routes ol ocean telcgrapns ; me surveys oi
-- . j----' , - - .
the Ureat Isthmus have been unaeruueen
and completed, and two vessels of the
navy are now employed, in conjunction
with those of England, a ranee, ana uer
many and Russia, in observations con
nected with the transit of Venus, useful
and interesting to the scientific world.
.Estimates for this Drancn oi me puDiic
service do not diner materially irom
those of last year, those for the general
support of the service being somewhat
less, and those for improvements at the
various stations, rather larger than the
corresponding estimate made a year ago.
The regular maintenance, and a steady
increase in the efficiency of this most im
portant arm in proportion to the growth
of our maritime intercourse and interests
is recommended to the attention of Con
gress. The use of the navy during peace
might be further utilized by a direct
authorization of the employment of naval
vessels in surveys of the supposed navi
gable waters of other nationalities in this
Continent, especially tributaries of the
two great rivers of South America, the
Orinoco and Amazon. Nothing prevents
under existing laws such exploration,
except that expenditures must be made
in such development of commercial in
terestsadvantageous to the people reached
and to those who may establish relations
with them.
Tne education of the people entitled
to exercise the right of franchise I re
gard essential to prosperity, everywhere,
and especially so in republics, where
neither education nor previous condition
enters into account in giving suffrage. '
Next to the public school, the post
office is the great agent of education,
over our vast territory.- The rapidity
with which new sections are being set
tled up, thus increasing the carrying of
i ' :j tl .-
mans in a mure rapiu rauu uinu iuo in
crease of receipts, is not alarming. The
report of the Postmaster General, here
with attached, shows that there was an
increase of revenue in his department in
1873 over the previous year of $1,674,
411, and an increase of cost of carrying
the mails, or paying employes of $3,041,-
467 81.
The report of the Postmaster General
gives interesting statistics of his depart
ment, and compares them with corres
ponding statistics of a year ago, showing
a growth in every branch of the depart
ment A postal convention nas been
concluded with New South Wales, an
exchange of postal cards, established with
Switzerland, and negotiations pending
for several years past with France, have
terminated in a convention with that
country which went into effect last Au
gust An International Postal Congress
was convened in Berne, Switzerland, in
September last, at which the United
States was -represented by an officer of
the foetal .Department ot much expe
rience and of good quail heat ion for the
position. A convention for the establish
ment of an International Postal Union
was agreed upon by the delegates ot the
countries represented, subject to the ap
proval of the proper authorities of these
countries.
I respectfully direct your attention to
the report ot the Postmaster tieneral,
and to his suggestions in regard to an
eaui table adjustment of the Question
of compensation to railroads for carrying
mails.
Your attention will be drawn to the
unsettled condition of affairs in some of
the Southern States. On the 14th of Sep
tember last, the Governor of Louisiana
called upon me, as provided by the
Constitution and laws of the United
States, for aid in the suppression of
domestic violence in that State. The call
was mad in view of a proclamation
issued on that day by D. B. Penn, stating
thas he was elected Lieutenant Governor
in 1 872, and calling upon the militia of
the state to arm, assemble and drive from
power the usurpers, as he dejignated the
officers of the btate liovernment. Un
the next day I issued my proclamation,
aud commanded the insurgents to dis
perse within five days from the date
thereof, and subsequently learned that
on that day they had taken forcible pos
session of the State House. Steps were
taken by me to support the existing rec
ognized State Governmens; but before
the expiration of the five days, the in
surrectionary movement was practically
abandoned, and the officers of the State
Government, with some minor excep
tions, resumed their powers and duties.
Considering that the present btate Ad
ministration of Louisiana bad been the
only government in that State for near
ly two years, that it has been tacitly ac
knowledged and acquiesced in as such
bv Congress, and more than once ex-
pressly recognized by me, I regarded it
as my clear duty, when legally called
upon for that purpose, to prevent its
overthrow by an armed mob under pre
tense of fraud and irregularity in the
election of 1872.
I have heretofore called the attention
of Congress to this subject, stating that
on account of the frauds and forgeries
committed at said election, and because
it appears that the returns thereof were
never legally canvassed, it was impossi
ble to tell thereby who were chosen; out
from the best sources of information at
mv command. I have always believed
that the present State officers received a
majority of the legal votes actually cast
at that election, l repeat wnai i sam in
my speccial message of February 13,
1873, that in the event of no action by
Congress I must continue to recognize
the government heretofore recognized by
me.
I regret to say that with preparations
for the late elections a decided indication
appeared in some localities in the South
ern States, of a determination, by acts
of violence and intimidation, to deprive
citizens of the freedom of the ballot be
cause of their political opinions. Bands
of men, masked and armed, made their
appearance: White Leagues and other
societies were formed, large quantities of
arms and ammunition were imported
and distributed to these organizations;
military drills, with menacing demon
strations, were held, and with all these,
murders enough were committed to
spread terror among those whose politi
cal action was to be suppressed, if possi
ble, by these intolerant and criminal
proceedings. In some places colored la
borers were compelled to vote according
to the wishes of their employers, under
threats of discharge if they acted other
wise, and there are too many instances
in which, when these threats were disre
garded, thev were remorselessly exe
cuted by those by whom they were made.
I understand that the Fifteenth Amend
ment to the Constitution was made to
prevent this state of things, and the act
of May 31, 1870, with amendments, was
passed to enforce its provisions, the ob
ject oeing to guarantee to uu ciuzeiis
the right" to vote and to protect them
in the free enjoyment of that right en
joined by the Constitution, to take
care that the laws be faithfully ex
ecuted ; and convinced by undoubted
evidence that violation of said act had
been committed, and that a widespread
and flagrant disregard of it was contem
plated, the proper officers were instructed
to prosecute the offenders, and troops
were stationed at convenient points to
aid these officers, if necessary, in the
performance of their official duties.
Complaints are made of this interference
by Federal authority, but if said amend
ment and act do not provide for such
interference under the circumstances as
above stated, then they are without
meaning, force or effect, and the whole
scheme of colored enfranchisement is
worse than mockery and little better
than a crime. Possibly Congress may
find it due to truth and justice to ascer
tain, by means of a committee, whether
the alleged wrongs to colored
citizens for political purposes were real
or the reports thereof were manufactured
for the occasion. The whole number of
troops in the States of Louisiana, Ala
bama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina,
Worth Carolina, Kentucky,, Tennessee,
Arkansas, Mississippi, Maryland, and
Virginia, at the time of election, were
4,082. This embraces the garrisons of
all the forts from the Delaware to the
Gulf of Mexico.
Another trouble has arisen in Arkan
sas. Article 13 of the Constitution of the
State, which was adopted in 1868, and
upon the approval of which by Congress
the State was restored to representation
as one of the States of the Union, pro
vides in effect that before any amend
ment proposed to the Constitution shall
become a part thereof, they shall be
passed by two successive Assemblies, and
then submitted to and ratified by a ma
jority of the electors of the State voting
therein. On the 11th of May. 1874. the
Governor convened an extra session of
the General Assembly of the State. which.
on the 18th of the same month, passed
an act providing for a Convention to
frame a new Constituion. Pursuant to
this act, and at an election held on the
80th of June, 1874, the Convention was
approved, and delegates were chosen
thereto, who assembled on the 14th of
last J uly and formed a new Constitution,
the schedule of which provided for the
election of an entire new set of State
officers, in a manner contrary to the then
existing election laws of the State. On
the 13th of October, 1874. this Constitu
tion, as therein provided, was sub
mitted to the people for their
approval or rejection, and according
to the election returns was approved by
a large majority of those qualified to vote
thereon, and at the same election persons
were chosen to nil all the state, county
and township offices.
J. he Governor elected in 1872 for the
term of four years, turned over his office
to the governor chosen under the new
Constitution, whereupon the Lieutenant-
Governor, also elected in 1872 for a term
of four years, churning to act as govern
or and alleging that such proceedings by
which the new Constitution was made
and a new set of officers elected, were un
constitutional, illegal and void-, called
upon me as provided in Section 4 of the
Constitution, to -protect the State against
domestic violence. As Congress is now
investigating the political affairs of Ar
kansas, I have declined to interfere with
the subject Executive interference with
the affairs of a State is repugnant to the
public and to the feeling of those who
from their official capacity must be used
in such interposition, and to him or those
who may direct it. Unless most clearly
on the side of the law such interference
becomes a crime. With the law to sup
port it, is is condemned without a hear
ing. I desire therefore that all necessity
for executive direction in local affairs
may become unnecessary and obsolete.
I invite the attention not only of
Congress, but of the people of the
United States, to the causes and effects of
these unhappy questions. Is there not
a disposition on one side to magnify
wrongs and outrages, and on the other
side to belittle them or justify them
If public opinion could be directed to
public survey of what is, and to rebuke
wrong and aiding the proper authorities
in punishing it, a better state of feeling
would be inculcated, and the sooner we
would have that peace which would
leave the State free indeed to regulate
their own domestic affairs. I believe on
the part of our citizens of the Southern
States the better part of them there
a disposition to be law-abiding, and to
do no violence, either to individuals or
the laws existing but do they do right
in ignoring the existence of violence and
bloodshed in resistance to constituted
authority? I sympathize with thei
prostrate condition, and would do all in
my power to relieve them, acknowledg
ing that in some instances they have
had most trying Governments to live un
der, and very oppressive ones in the
way of taxation for nominal improve
ments, not giving benefits equal to the
hardships imposed. But can they pro
claim themselves entirely excusable for
this condition? They can not Violence
has been rampant in some localities, and
has, further, been justified or denied by
- those who could have prevented it
The theory is raised that there is to be
no more interference on the part ot the
General Government to protect citizens
whithin a State where the btate authori
ties fail to give protection. This is
great mistake. While I remain Execu
tive all the laws of Congress and the pro
visions of the Constitution, including the
amendments added thereto, will be en
forced with vigor, without regret that
they should have added one jot or tittle
to the Executive duties and powers. Let
there be firmness in the discussion of
Southern Questions : the advocates of
both or all political parties giving honest.
truthful reports of occurrences, or de
nouncing the wrong and upholding the
right, and soon all will be well. Under
existing conditions the negro votes the
Republican ticket because he knows his
friends are of that party many a good
citizen votes the opposite, not because he
agrees with the great principles ot state,
WTiich separate parties, but because gen
erally he is opposed to negro rule. This
is a most delusive crv. Treat the negro
as a citizen and voter, as he is, and must
remain, and soon the parties will be de
vided, not on the color line, but on prin
ciples, ihen we snail nave no compiamt
of sectional interferences.
The report of the Attorney General
contains valuable recommendations re
lating to the administration of justice in
the courts of the United States, to which
I invite your attention. I respectfully
suggest to Congress the propriety ot in
creasing the number of Judicial Districts
in the United States to eleven, the pres
ent number being nine, and the creation
of two additional judgeships. The terri
torv to be traversed by the Circuit
Judges is so great, and the business
the Courts so steadily increasing, that
is growing more and more impossible for
them to keep up with the business re
quiring their attention. Whether this
would involve the necessity of adding
two more Justices of the Supreme Court
to the present number, I submit to the
judgment of Congress.
The attention of Congress is invited to
the report of the Secretary of the In
terior, and to the legislation asked for by
him. The domestic interests of the peo
ple are more intimately connected with
this department than with either of the
other departments of the Government
Its duties have been added to from time
to time, until they have become so oner
ous that without the most perieci system
and order it will be impossible for any
Secretary of the Interior to keep trace
all the omciai transactions naviug mn
sanction and done in his name, and for
which he is held personally responsible,
The doIicv adopted for the manage
ment of the Indian affairs, known as the
neace noliev. has been adhered to with
most beneficial results. It is hoped that
a few years more will relieve our fron
tiers ol Indian depredations. I commend
the recommendation of the Secretary for
the extension of the homestead laws to
Indians, and for some sort of territorial
government for the Indian Territory. A
great majority of the Indians occupying
this territory are believed to be incapa
ble of maintaining their rights against
the more civilized and enlightend man.
Any territorial form of government given
them, therefore, should protect them in
their homes and property for a period of
at least twenty years, and before its final
adoption should be ratified by a majority
of those affected.
The report of the Secretary of the In
terior, herewith attached, gives much
interesting statistical information, which
I refrain from giving an abstract of, but
refer you to the report itself.
The act of Congress providingthe oath
which pensioners must subscribe before
drawing their pensions cuts ofl from this
bounty a few survivors of the war of 1812,
residing in the Southern States. I rec
ommend the restoration of this bounty
to all such. The number of persons
whose names would be restored to the list
nf tm.ii si an s is not laree. They are all
old pensioners who could have taken no
part in tne reoeinon, aim wc i,;i
which they were awarded pensions were
in defense of the whole country.
The report of the Commissioner of Ag
riculture, herewith, contains suggestions
of much interest to the general public,
and refers to the approaching Centennial,
and the part his department is ready to
take in it I feel that the Nation at
large is interested in having this expo
sition a success, and commend to Con
gress such action as will secure a greater
general interest in it. Already many
is
of
it
of
foreign Nations have signified their in
tention to be represented at it It may
be expected that every civilized Nation
will be represented.
The rules adopted to improve the civil
service of the Government have been ad
hered to as closely as has been practicable
with the opposition with wftich they
meet The effect I believe, has been
beneficial on the whole, and has tended
to the elevation of the service, but it is
mpracticable to maintain them without
the direct and positive support or con
gress. Generally the support which this
reiorm receives is irom mose wuo give it
their support only to find fault when the
rules are apparently departed from. Re
movals irom omce witnout prcierniig
charges against the parties removed are
frequently cited as departures from the
rules adopted, and the retention of those
against whom charges are made by irre
sponsible persons and without good
grounds is also often condemned as a
violation of them. Under these circum
stances, therefore, I announce that if
Congress adjourns without positive legis
lation on the subject of civil service re
form, 1 will regard such action as a dis
approval of the system, and will aban
don it Except so far as to require ex
amination for certain appointees, to de
termine their fitness, competitive exam
inations will be abandoned. The gentle
men who have given their services with
out compensation, as members of the
Koard, to devise rules and regulations tor
the government of the Civil Service of the
country, have shown much zeal and
earnestness in their work, and to them
as well as to myself, it will be a source
of mortification if it is to be thrown
away. But I repeat that it is impossible
to carry this system to a successful issue
without general approval and assistance,
and a positive law to support it
I have stated that the elements of
prosperity to the Nation's capital and
labor, skilled and untrained, and pro
ducts of the sou, still remain with us.
To direct the employment of this is
problem deserving the most serious at
tention of Congress. If employment
can be given to ail labor ottering itself,
prosperity necessarily follows. I have
expressed the opinion, and repeat it
the hrst requisite to the accomplishment
of this end is the substitution of a sound
currency in place of one of a fluctuating
value. This secured, there are many in
terests that might be fostered, to the great
profit of both labor and capital. How
to induce capital to employ labor is the
question. The subject of cheap trans
portation has occupied the attention of
Congress. New light on this question
will, without doubt, be given the com
mittee appointed by the last Congress to
investigate and report upon this subject
A revival of ship-building and particu
larly of iron steamship-building is of
vast importance to our National pros
perity. The United States is now pay
ing over $1,000,000 per annum for
freights and passage on foreign ships, to
be carried abroad and expended
in the employment and support of
other people, beyond a fair percentage of
what should go to foreign vessels, esti
mating on the tonnage and travel ef each
respectively. It is to be regretted that
this disparity in the carrying trade ex
ists, and to correct I would be willing to
see a great departure irom the usual
course of the Government in supporting
what might be usually termed private
enterprise. I would not suggest as a
remedy direct subsidy to American lines
of steamships, but I would suggest the
direct offer of ample compensation for
carrying the mails between Atlantic and
and seaboard cities and the Continent on
American owned and American built
steamers,, and would extend this liberality
to vessels carrying the mails to the
South American States, and to Cen
tral America -and Mexico, and would
pursue the same policy from our Pacific
seaports to foreign seaports on the Pacific.
It might be demanded that vessels built
for this service should come up to
standard fixed by legislation, tunnage
and speed, and all other qualities look
ing to the possibility of the Government
requiring mem at some time for war pur
poses. The right also of taking posses
sion of them in such emergency should
be guarded. I offer these suggestions,
believing them worthy of considerations
in all seriousness, affecting all sections and
all interests alike. If anything better
can be done to direct the country into
course of general prosperity no one will
be more ready than 1 to adopt this pian.
Forwarded herewith is the plan and
report of the Commissioners appointed
under the act of Congress approved June
20. 1874. to wind up the afiairs of the
District Government. It will be seen
from the report that the total debt of the
District ot Columbia, less assets on nana
and available, as bonded debt issued
prior to July 1, 1873, $8,883,940.43, 3.65
bonds. Act of Congress, June 20, 1874,
$2,088,168.73. Certificates of the Board
of Audit. $4,770,558.45, total, $15,742,
667.61 ; less special improvement assess
ments cnargeaoie to private property iu
excess of any demand against assessment
$164,054.37, less Chessapeake and Ohio
Canal Bonds $75,000, and W ashington
and Alexandria Bonds $50,000 in the
hands of the Commissioners of the Sink
ing Fund $1,748,054 37, leaving an actu-
al debt, less said runa, oi iz,yy-,ou
In addition to this there are claims pre
ferred against the Board of the .District,
amounting in the aggregate, reported by
the Board of Audit $3,147,787 48,
which a greater part will probably be re
jected. This sum can with no more pro
Drietv be included in the debt of the Dis
trict Government than the thousands
claims against the General Government
can be included as a portion of the Na
tional debt, but the aggregate sum thus
stated includes something more than tne
funded debt chargeable exclusively
the District of Columbia.
The act of Congress of November 28,
1874, contemplates an apportionment
between the United States Government
and the District of Columbia in respect
of the payment of the principal and in
terest ot the 3.W bonas. inereiore,
compiling with precision the bonded
debt of the District the aggregate sums
above stated as respects the 3.65 bonds
now issued, the outstanding certificates
of the Board of Credit and the unad
justed claims pending before that Board,
should be reduced to the extent of the
amount to be apportioned to the United
States Uovernment in tne manner indi
cated in the act of Congress of June 20,
1874! I especially invite your attention
to the recommendation of the Commis
sioners of the sinking fund relative to
the ambiguity of the act of June 20, 1874,
the interest on the District bonds and
the consolidation of indebtedness to the
District
I feel much iudebted to the gentlemen
who consented to leave their private af
fairs, and from a distance to attend to
the business of this District, and for the
able and satisfactory manner in which it
has been conducted I am sure their ser
vices will be equally appreciated by the
entire country.
It will be seen from the accompanying
full report of the Board of Health, that
the sanitary condition of the District is
very satisfactory. In my opinion, the
District of Columbia should be regarded
as the grounds of the National Capital,
in which the entire people of the coun
try are interested. I do not allude to
this to urge general appropriations to
the District, but to draw the attention of
Congress, in framing a law for the
government of the District to the mag
nificent scale on which the city was
planned by the founders of the Govern
ment the manner in which, for orna
mental purposes, the reservations, streets
and avenues were laid out, and the pro
portion of the property actually possessed
by the General Government I think
the proportion of expenses of the Govern
ment and improvements, to be borne by
the General Government the cities of
Washington and Georgetown, and the
country should be carefully and equita
bly defined.
In accordance with Section 3 of the
act approved June 23, 1874, 1 appointed
a board to make a survey of the mouth
of the Mississippi River, with a view to
determine the best method of obtaining
and maintaining a depth of water suffi
cient for the purposes of commerce, etc.,
and in accordance with an act entitled
"An act to provide for the appointment
of a commission of engineers to investi
gate and report a permanent plan for the
excavation of the alluvial basTri of the
Mississippi River subject to inundation,"
I appointed a commission of engineers.
Neither board has yet completed its
labors. When its reports are received
they will be forwarded to Congress with
out

EXECUTIVE MASION, Dec. 7, 1874.
Editorial Writers.
[From the New York Independent.]
One column a day is a fair average on
the New York press for an editorial
writer, and this could be written in a
few hours, while three articles per week
is the usual stint for the leader writers
on the London Times. Horace Greeley's
literary labors, vast as they were, did not
occupy many hours, and much of his
time was consumed in seeing visitors,
reading and traveling; and even then he
died of overwork, as did Henry J. Ray
mond, though he, too, always took long
periods of rest after his spasms of severe
work, bamuel Howies, by aid of a sten
ographer, gets through a full day's stint
of editorial writing and correspondence
in a few hours daily. C. Dana is at the
Sun office from about 10 to 5, While much
of this time is given to receiving visitors
and other light work. Whitelaw Reid
and Louis J. Jennings edit their respec
tive papers during the two hours of each
afternoon and three or four hours at
night Parke Godwin, D. G. Croly, and
Major Bundy, who all three have charge
of afternoon newspapers, limit their
office hours usually from 9 o'clock to 4
at the most, which includes an hour for
luncheon. As a sample of the daily life
of an exceptionally hard-working jour
nalist the following account given by
Henry Watterson, editor of the Louis
ville Lourter-Journal, may be interesting.
It is taken from an unpublished letter.
and it should be remembered that it is
written by a man who is partly blind
" I wake up at 10 o'clock in the morning,
and, after a cup of coffee, I write for two
hours in bed. I get up at noon and have
a plunge bath, and take breakfast with
my family, who then have taken their
lunch. I go to the office afterwards, and
remain there till seven, prepared to see
everybody that calls. During the same
time the work of the day is planned out
and everybody begins it I then go
home and .have supper, and spend the
evening until 10 o'clock there, usually
listening to reading by my wife, or hav
ing a little music. At 10 o'clock I am
back at the office again, where I remain
uutil 2 o'clock. 1 am enly able to write
two hours a day myself, and the rest is
done bv dictation. I read but little my
self, but glance through the exchanges,
in order to give an idea of things, hav
ing important articles read out loud to
me. 1 have no time tor exercise, and do
not care for riding, all the exercise I get
being in walking to and fro from my
office." As an example of the literary
productiveness of most of the brilliant
and steady writers on the press, I may
odd that John Hay writes only two
hours a day, usually in the afternoon,
though his favorite time of composition
is before breakfast He writes rapidly.
but his daily average is only one column
of T ribune brevier. The other members
of the Tribune staff Hassard, Noah,
Brooks, Bromley, and Congdon do about
the same. The average amount written
by the staff of the lima is about the
same. Two of the hardest literary
workers in America are Edward Everett
Hale and James Parton. Yet the forh.er
is at his desk but three hours each day,
and always insists on having nine hours'
sleep, which is the same amount that
President Grant requires, while Mr.
Parton calls his daily work four hours
composition and three hours research, or
about seven hours in all, and never ex
ceeds this limit
Nut Trees.
a

'
We are sometimes asked if it will pay
to raise nuts for market ? We "cannot
answer this question with a direct yes or
no,' but will give some facts and sugges
tions concerning the culture of some of
them, and leave our readers to judge for
themselves if it will be best for them to
plant nut bearing trees.
Among the most important of these
trees is the shell-bark, several varieties
of which are found growing wild in vari
ous parts of the Northern and Middle
States. There is a great difference in the
size, quality and thickness of shell of the
varieties or sub-varieties. The best we
ever saw was of large size, with a thin
shell, and meat of excellent flavor. My
father planted nuts of this variety, and
in twenty years the trees yielded fruit
and in thirty-three years we gathered
quite a large crop. We raised a good
many of these trees, and kept them for
sale in our nursery, itome of them are
now auite large, and bearing vearlv.
It is always best to select a good vari
ety, and then take the nuts and keep
them in moist earth over winter, away
from rats, mice, and squirrels, and then
in the spring plant the same, if possible,
where they are to stand permanently.
In this way they grow much faster, and
take a stronger hold. All walnut trees
are peculiar in having a very large and
strong tap root that penetrates the soil
to a great depth. We have actually seen
a greater length of root than height of
top in many ot the walnut trees that we
have taken up. Our plan was to cut
under all walnut seedlings with a sharp
spade during the latter part of the first
season of their growth. By doing this,
we secured more lateral roots and the
trees stood the process of transplanting
much better.
The pecan nut and English walnut,
both favorite nuts in the market will
not withstand a northern climate, and
are not worth planting. The American
chestnut is. perhaps, the next most valu
able nut and possibly, on some soils, or
in some locations, may prove to be of
more value than the shell-bark. This
tree is easily grown, and may be trans
planted with greater safety than the wal
nut, as it has mo.-e fibrous roots. The
nuts should be treated in the same way
as the walnuts, by being put in earth
soon after they are gathered, and there
kept moist until the time comes to plant
them in the spring. These trees make a
rapid growth, and begin to give fruit in
ten or fifteen years, lhere is a very
great difference in the size of chestnuts,
and care should be taken to select the
very largest for planting. Everything
else being equal, the large ones will sel
much quicker, and for a higher price.
The Spanish chestnut that has been in
troduced here is a very large variety;
but is not perfectly hardy, and not worth
setting out
We think there are hundreds of acres
of rocky and almost worthless land that
might be planted with walnut and chest
nut, and iu the end prove to be a good
investment We do not say so much as
this because of the value of the nuts
alone, but the value of the timber, added
to the fruit, will altogether make a hand
some thing. It is true that it requires
about the life time of a man to get such
a plantation well into bearing ; but when
once it is in existence, it will last for a
century or two, and prove of great value
for fruit for shade, and for timber or
wood if cut down.
Many young men who have " fathers
that are well off, have no ambition, and
no particular prospect lhey scorn a
trade. A man that is too well born for a
trade is very well born for a gallows!
Thousands of parents, who, by industry,
have gained a position which enables
them to destroy their children, takes the
surest way to accomplish their distinc
tion by encouraging them in idleness,
and allowing them, as they grow up, to
feel that it is disgraceful to work at what
ever manual labor best suits their tal
ents, no matter whether their father is a
minister, or a lawyer, or a Senator, or
the President ot the United States. Many
young men are looking forward upon life
with the general idea to enjoy them
selves. They are provided with all the
needful physical " comforts, and they
mean to be happy. They slight their
profession. Their whole governing prin
cipal in life is to shirk anything like
work, and they expect to have enjoyment
without industry! But no man in this
world will be happy who violates the
fundamental law of industry. You must
work if you are going to be a happy man.
I know you think it is hard, but if God
had meant that you should be a butterfly,
you would be born a butterfly. And as
you were not born a moth or a miller,
but a man, you must accept the condi
tion of your manhood. And if there is
one principle that is more important at
the very threshold of life than another,
it is that man is born to work.
Prosperity in the West.
In the general talk at the East of hard
times and depression ef business accom
panied by the closing of mills and the
reducing of working-time in others, it
it a comfort to turn to the more cheering
figures which indict the prosperity of
the West Last winter after the panic
had stricken the general business of trans
portation, the rates of grain were so
much lower that notwithstanding the
close of navigation the movement of
grain was so heavy during the whole
winter that the surplus of the North
west standing over in the spring was
very much reduced. So great was this
reduction that at the opening of naviga
tion in the spring the ordinary high
rates of freight on the lakes for moving
the winter accumulation did not prevail.
The western producers, therefore, began
the season of 1874 with more casn in
hand, received all during the winter,
than had ever been known in any pre
vious year. ' -
The cash value of corn received in
Chicago during the twelve months of
1873 was S14,WU,UW. me casn value oi
corn received in Chicago in 1874 not
allowing for the six weeks yet to expire
is $21,000,000, an increase of cash to
the producers ol hfty per cent, over last
year. The crop of 1874 was less in
quantity, but the advance in prices has
placed in thethands of the western pro
ducers more than fifty per cent more
cash for a less quantity than they received
last year. The additional $7,000,000 is
of itself a handsome and handy thing to
have on hand.
Assuming that the whole number of
hogs to be packed in the West this sea
sonthat is, from October 1st, 1874, to
February 1st 1875 will be five millions,
the actual sum to be paid for them in
cash will not fall short of $85,000,000.
The season promises to be shorter than
usual, as farmeis are sending their hogs
to market to avoid feeding them on high
Ericed corn. This crop also foots up a
andsome advance over last year.
There has been perhaps halt as mucn
corn shipped from the West which has
passed round Chicago as has been re
ceived here. During the same period
from the close of harvest through the
winter there will be perhaps $15,000-,
000 worth of wheat passing through Chi
cago, with other grain, oat, rye, etc.,
worth $10,000,000 more. All this will
be paid for in cash on shipment
While the manufacturers, or cotton
and wcolen goods, protected as they are
by a national bounty hanging from
thirty-live to seventy per cent. m u
their products, are dismissing their work
men, running on half time, and pledging
each other to produce one-third or one-
fourth less the farmer oi me nor la

Thia 151.b00.000 in cash will pass in
to the hands of the producers, the greater
share of it from Chicago. As the season
of 1874 opened with the farmers compar
atively full-handed from the praceeus oi
their sales during the winter of 1873,
they will this year be in even a much
better condition as to the supply of
money. It is true that the price of
wheat has been less than usual, but the
advance in all other grains has, in the ag
gregate, more than compensated for the
reduction in wheat
This large sum of cash thus sent to the
farms all over the West has of necessity
stimulated production in other lines.
This money is not hoarded. It is all ex
pended in one way or the other for com
modities not produced on the farms. It
has kept the general trade of Chicago
and ot the West active during the fall,
and will continue to keep it so during the
winter. . The manufacturers of Chicago
having customers thus prosperous, are
themselves with their working men
made sharers in the general prosperity of
the West ,
In the list of cash products of the
farmers sold in Chicago we have not in
cluded the cattle, which foot up an ag
gregate among the millions. A large
part of these cattle come from Texas, and
for that reason can not be credited to the
immediate West tributary to Chicago.
Chicago Tribune.
A Sailor's Cruise in Detroit.
A sailor named John Bates yesterday
hired a horse and cutter for a turn
around the city, and he hadn't been out
over fifteen minutes when -he came back
to the barn, leading the horse, and said
that the entter was "down there some
where," in about a hundred pieces. He
didn't want to pay its full value, and be
ing taken before Justice Potter he was
asked to state his case.
" Well, you know," he commenced, as
he rolled his quid to the other cheek, "I
chartered that craft for a cruise around
town."
" Yes."
"I; got aboard, battened down
hatches, and gave the hoes a free sheet
He wanted to run dead before the wind,
but I hauled him up, eased off the booms
a little and got the wind.on the quarter.
" Then he went, did he V
"Yessir,thenheflucked. We passed
Point Betsey flying, and though I saw
other crafts taking in sail I kept the top
gallant sail hung out and held her
steady." , ,
"Do you mean that the horse ran
away f inquired the Justice.
"Yes, sir, I do- I threw the wheel
over, took a pull at the halyard and
hauled away at the sheets, but she was
pinted out to sea, and old Davy Jones
couldn't have swung her a point I tried
to shorten sail, but she rolled in so much
sea over her bows that she foundered.'
" The entter was smashed, yon mean r
" Yes, sir; she went down stern first,
and I went overboard and was picked up
by a steam barge wearing blue buttons,
who charged me with scuttling the craft.
I want to do the fair thing, captain, but
I'm blowed if this 'ere skipper ought to
send out a craft loaded by the head and
no insurance on the cargo."
He finally agreed to pay a sum satis
factory to all parties, and when he had
handed over the money he remarked:
" Well, I suppose I can up anchor and
forge ahead? I havn't. dropped anchor
in this kind of a harbor for ten years be
fore, and Tm going to buy an ax and
take a tug for the Canada woods. Good
bye, captain keep your jibs down
trim."
The Mosquito.
In its perfect, or winged, state it is
about as annoying a creature as can be,
but then it must be remembered that the
traveler is but a casual intruder in the
natural domain of the mosquito, and
must expect the consequences of his in
trusion. Devouring travelers is not the
normal occupation of the mosquito, for
hundreds of successive generations may
live and die, and not one of them ever
see a human being. Their real object is
a beneficent one. In their larval state
they live in the water, and feed upon
tiny particles of decaying matter that
are too small to be appreciated by the
larger aquatic beings, and, by devouring
them, purify the water and convert
death into life. Even In our ponds at
home we are much indebted to the gnat
larvae for saving us from miasma ; while
the vast armies of mosquito larv that
swarm along the edges of tropical lakes
and feed upon the decaying substances
that fall from the herbage of the banks
purify at the same time the water and
the atmosphere, and enable human be
ings to breathe with safety the air in
which without their aid no animal higher
than a reptile could have existed.
The Ceuter or Population. North
and South, the center of population
steadily clings to the thirty-ninth par
allel, along which are situated Baltimore,
Washington and Cincinnati. At no
time from 1790 to 1870 has the center of
population departed north or south of
this line more than twenty-six miles. It
has marched westward 899 miles in that
period, the greatest leap being from
1860 to 1860 (eighty-one miles) when
the transfer of a small population to the
Pacific coost gave a sudden elongation to
the Wes . i arm of the fulcrum, quite a
distance. It is now forty-eight miles
east of Cincinnati, and in 1880 will
neatly coincide with that city.
