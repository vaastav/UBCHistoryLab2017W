Since its organization, the Legislatur :
has been industriously engaged at tlie
work before i' willi a view of effecting
an adjournment before Christmas, mid
the prospect for accomplishing this result
is good, since both Houses have passed
the concurrent resolution fixing the 23rd
of this month as the date of final adjourn
ment, and it cannot now be chnnged
without consent of both the Senate and
House of Representatives. The date was
fixed thus carly in the session, in order
to stimulate thc members to work rapid
ly, so that a short session might be se
cured and the wishes of thc people car
ried out. If this date had not bcd fixed
thus carly, the introduction of bills, reso
lutions, ?kc., would have continued, and,
instead of adjourning before Christinas,
wc would only have taken a recess and
returned for an indefinite peri d after the
holidays, while by the course pursued it
is expected to wind up with a session of
only twenty-eight days.
Tin-: wo UK
to be done in the time allowed is con
siderable, a..d the financial portion of it
will bc very embarrassing. T?tere arc
deficiencies from last year which will
have to be paid off out of tho next tax
levy ; the Hills of the Hank of thc State
are still a very troublesome problem to
deal with ; thc report of Commissioner
Coit upon thc floating indebtedness of
the State presents a little over a million
dollars of indebtedness after scaling it to
fifty cents on the dollar, which must bo
provided for, and then comes the ordi
nary expenses of thc government. The
session bus not progressed sufficiently to
tell what will bo done with thc Hills of
the Hank of the State, or the floating in
debtedness, but, of course, the deficien
cies of last year and tho expenses of the
government for the current year must be
met in full, and unless tho present Leg
islature makes very material reductions,
thc rate of taxation will of necessity be
very much increased. Thc present hotly
not only is embarrassed by the expenses
of tho government during their own
term, but will also have the additional
burden of clearing up tho arrearages of
last year. The members of both Houses
have addressed themselves assiduously to
the task, and in addition to the short ses
sion, there is every probability that the
per diem will nlso bc cut down. Dr.
John Wilson, of our delegation, has in
troduced a bill fixing tho per diem of
members at
TU REE DOLLARS PER DAY,
ami there is very little doubt that it will
be adopted, and thus the Legislature
having cut down their own compensa
tion, will bo enabled to curtail other ex
penses without subjecting themselves lo
criticism. Three dollars a day is a small
compensation, but it is sufficient to se
cure the services of as good men as can
be procured at higher salaries, and there
fore it is all that tho State ought to pay.
Thc reduction will make tho position a
moro honorable one than it would bo
with a high salary, for the experience of
every State bas been that high salaries
for members of thc Legislaturo brings
into competition for thc olfico a class of
aspirants who caro more for the money
than for tho honor of representing their
constituents. There are a number of
arguments which will bo adduced in sup
port of ibis bill if necessary. It is, how
ever, useless to occupy the time of our
readcr3 in recounting them, for nine
teenths of them, aro fully satisfied that thc
reduction should bo mada, and it is luis
well-known public sentiment which will
sccuro its passage. Dr. Brown, of our
delegation, filed a protest against one
Hastings Gantt, who was elected to thc
Houao of House of Representatives from
Beaufort, on tho ground that he is dis
qualified to servo as a member because
he is known to have accepted
A HUI nr. FROM PATTERSON1
in some of tho legislation concerning the
Blue Ridge Railroad. Tho protest will
result in expelling Gantt, and, although
another Radical will bo elected, the
party will learn that it is useless for
them to continuo electing their corrupt
men to office, for they will not be admit
ted to seats in a body which will in
future bc controlled by gentlemen. Mr.
Murray has introduced, among others, a
bill to employ couvicts sentenced to
County jaiL upon the roads and streets
under direction of County Commission
ers, which, if passed, will utilizo a set of
criminals who have hitherto been a bur
den without any benefit to the County.
Last session of tho Legislature there
were fifty charters granted by the Legis
laturo which could have been given by
the Clerk of tho Court in each County,
and theso charters at a moderato estimate
cost the State twenty thousand dollars.
Tho samo thing was begun again this
session, but hr^t neoir checked by indefi
nitely postponiug tbs first ono presented.
This motion to postpoi?o was mndo by
Mr. Murray, and a spirited debau. of
half an hour followed, after which tht
motion was carried by a majority of two.
It has, however, put a stop* tc this useless
consumption of time and expenditure of
money.
There are several very important mat
ters which are being carefully approach
ed by their advocates, une1- upon thc re
sult of these movements will depend very
great interests of the State. Prominent
among these ls tho movement whkh was
introduced by.General Gary in the
Senate
TO REIM : M. TUB BOND COURT,
whic' in all probability will pass both
branches of tho Legislature soon Un
less tb ia, is done, there ia a strong proba
bility that tho. Court will decide thc
Stat? do'Jt valid, inasmuch us the testi
mony of Klnripton and others was kept
out of reach during tho trial of tho case,
and the State's attorney* - were cnly able
ti present a part of tho cvideneo going
t'j show tho fraudulent character of pofr
tiona of tho ''cht. It is, therefore, it
.seems to us, the duty of the Legislature
ta step in and protect tho people from
tho burden likely to be ri voled upon
them forever.
THE rnbsI'IlAYV. O.CEST10N
ii up again, but hos not been devolv? cd
sufficiently t<> be tho subject of much
comment, though it is a very important
matter for thc whole .State. Itt a future
lotter wc will endeavor to give a review j
of the subject, and t'peak of what dispo- j
sitio? should be mad'.1 of it.
Tlie Legislature, though composed of
new members principally, is fast becom
ing familiar enough with law-making to
call thc aye- and noes, which is some
times done on thc most trivial matter-,
nt a cont i > tlie .State of about fifteen
dollars for each call. It is frequently
done for tlo- purpose of making capital
for men who think they are voting on
the popular xidc of the question. It is
proper, in voling upon main questions,
that the roll should bc called when vcr
it is desired ; but when il lakes the shape
of electioneering, and is dorn over every
little motion, il becomes rallier an ex
pensive, mode of electioneering, and
should not bc indulged in.
There will soon be u change in t!.e
Superintendent of thc Penitentiary, ap
Col. Pannele intends to resign, and the
A udersoil and other delegations are press
ing the claims of Maj. T. B. Lee, tito
first Superintendent, for re-appointment,
with excellent prospects of success. Maj.
Lee is a very efficient and competent
gentleman, who would, no doubt, suit
bettor for the ollicc than any niau we can
lind.
The Supremo Court has just decided
tho cases of Smalls and Carduzo against
them, so Hint these worthies will be
brought to punishment al last, unios
they are pardoned by tho Governor,
which we trust will not be done. There
hus boon au abundance of foolishness in
South ('anilina towards the criminals
who have infested our State, and it is
about time now, we think, to let justice
reign for a tenn at least. Under the
sentences Carduzo goes to jail for two
years, and Smalls to thc Penitentiary for
three, years.
nov. HAMPTON'S CONDITION
has been quite alarming to his friends
recently, and the worst results wore fear
ed. He has been unable to sec company
lately, and has boon threatened with se
rious complications from bis wounds.
Saturday it is thought his system
reached the crisis from tho wound, and
during that day his physicians, oven,
dreaded what twenty-four hours might
bring about. Telegrams were sont, and
doctors came on special trains from Au
gusta and Charleston, and on Sunday
oarnost prayers for the restoration of the
Governor to health went up from every
pulpit in Columbia, and on Sunday
evening ali of the congregations of th?
city assembled at the Methodist Church,
where a union prayer-meeting was held
for the purpose of continuing the suppli
cations to a Throne of Grace in his be
half. His situation is, it is thought,
slightly improved, though it is still criti
cal, and his friends watch with groat
anxiety the varying indications. His
restoration to health will be a slow and
tedious process, which will, when it is
accomplished, leave him with a still* limb
for thc remainder of his life. The peo
ple of the Slate have learned !<y tho
Governor's absence to appreciate him
more highly than they ever did before,
and it is now certain that on next Tues
day he will be elected United States
Senator to succeed Patterson on tho
kurth of .March. Tho probability is
that his election will be unanimous.
TIIK JUDO Kan IP
of the Third Circuit, to lill tho vacancy
occasioned by the death of Judge Shaw,
waa filled on last Tuesday by tho election
of i?on. T. II. Frazer, of Sumter, who is
an able and high-toned gentleman, by
whoso election the Bench of South Caro
lina bas secured an upright and pure
Judge lo replace thc lamentad Shaw.
Tl IK UNITED STATES COURT
is stiii in sos-ion, Judges Bond and Brynn
presiding. It is, however, robbed of its
promised importance by thc continuance
of most of the election cases, and tho
attendance, outside of the jurors and
lawyers, is composed of nbout four-fifths
of negroes, many of whom have boon
brought hither at tho expense of the
Government to tell their marvelous tales
of intimidation, fraud, Ac. The coses
arc evidently intended to get up Re iub
lican campaign literature, for, to givi ar
example, Mr. Peebles, of Sumter, was
arrested, gave bond and went, home, after
which thc witnesses were examined in
Columbia, and their testimony taken
down. Judge Northrop and E. W. M.
Mackey are both directing the prosecu
tions without much credit to themselves
or benefit to tho Government. As mill
ers in the outrago business, they appear
to bo a very diminutive success, not be
cause the spirit is unwilling, but boco uso
tho flesh is weak.
Columbia bids foirto bo very liveiy
this winter, but it is likely that the mem
bers of the Legislature will be kept too
busy and receive too little pay to alford
them much opportunity for participating
in it. M.
Tho Supreme Court of South Carolina
has decided, in the case of Flibu Haven- I
port and wife against Elizabeth Caldwell,
that thc Probate Court has no jurisdic
tion under the Constitution of this State
to partition real estate. The decision is
a startling ono to tho legal fraternity
throughout the State, as perhaps nine?
tenths of the estates which have boon di
vided 8?nco reconstruction haw been par
titioned in tho Probate Court, and this
decision unsettles all titles Which hare
been acquired under such sales. The de
cision is good law, as tho highest dm rt
in tho State has rendered it, brit there
can bc no doubt that it is a very unfor
tunate one for tho people, not only be
cause it invalidates hundred, of title?,
but also because it necessitates the par
tition of estates in the Circuit Court,
which will bo a slower nnd more expen
sive modo of procedure. Tue Legisla
ture is looking into thc matter, and will
do all thnt can be done by that body to
remedy tho evil, but, ai thu defect ls con
stitutional, any relief which may be at
tempted will bo of doubtful validity.
The people and thc bar will no doubt
agree with us when wo expr?s* thc opin
ion t?i?t it would have been better for
tho Supremo Court to have ?tretched the
law to sustain the jurisdiction of thc Pro
bate Court rather than have rendered A
decision which will work M> much injus
tice ani inconvenience without con
ferring any good in compensation there
for.
<;<> VERNOR'S .niiSS it!E.
We publish in tliW issue thc annual
message of Governor Simpson. As u
State paper it is concilie, dear mid prac
tical. Thc Governor ?loes nut deal in
fanciful speculations or abstract theories,
but places before the Legislature the
living questions of thu dav, upon the j
consideration ol which depend the peace
and prosperity of thc people nf th?' State, j
Thc message truly urges two things us
essential to the progress ?nd prosperity j
ol* the State: ?oed government, which it .
asset Ls we nmr haye, and tl.'- develop- J
incut of tiie ?litl? rent departments pf hu
man industry* While government cati*
md create capital anti labor in st country
it can and ought to protect c apital, < ti
cotirngo labor, and by wiso and judicious ,
legislation render each of these eilicieut
in developing the agricultural, eoniiuer
cia I it nd manufacturing iu'in-t- of thc |
Slate. The mi-er.il.le government of j
eight years paralyzed capital, demoral
ized labor and brought the people of the '
Slate to the verge ol'ruin. Two years of ?
i.id lligent and honest government ha?
done much tn repair thc ruin brought '
abotil by thu Had ?cal*, but much yet re
mailla to bc done, and it will require the
wisdom of the executive and legislative
departments combined with renewed
energy und industry to reslote general
prosperity. Thc message in its toi^e is ?
mild and considerate, and its rccoinmcn
dations will claim the attention not only '
of the Leginhittirc but of the whole couti- i
try. *
President Hayes, in his annual mes
sage sent to Congress on lust Monday,
dwells at length on the frauds and in
timidation practiced at thc late elections
in the South, especially designating the
States of Louisiana and South Carolina,
and declares his Intention lo investigate
and punish tho guilty parties. This is
all right a* far as it goes, fora number
of those charged willi the offences have
been discharged upon preliminary exam
ination, and the intimidation, of which
so much bas been alleged, will be shown
to be falsehoods, made hy Radicals for
Northern consumption. Again, we have
not heard of the arrest of a single Radi
cal hy the Federal authorities for intimi
dating I Hume--ts, when it is well known
that colored Pcinocruts were ostracised,
beaten and excluded fnnn church mem
bership because they voted against thc
Radicals. Colored Radicals voted with
out molestation or liiuderance, while
colorid Democrats were denied these
right-. The President hollis that Coil
irrcHsiounl elect ion**, in ever" district, ure
justly n matter of political importance
throughout 'he whole country, and while
this is true, how much more important is
thc election of President by the millions
of voters of the whole country? and
if fraud in the election of a member of
Congress is a great crime, what is lite
nature of the clinic that foists upon the
forty millions of the inhabitants of the
country a fraudulent President, who was
defeated by hull il million of votes? Mr.
Haye- holds his office by one ol'the most
stupendous political frauds ever imposed
on a people, and ?ll becomes him to lec
ture nu the subject until his own skirt*
arc cleansed.
The Abbeville "Moonshiners."
The facts of the supposed attack en
revenue officers in Abbeville County, ns
given by the Press and /launer, are as
follows :
1. A posso of revenue officers came to
the Lowndcsville neighborhood .still
hunting.
2. They found a still, but not un illicit
one.
3. A few reckless youths came near
the house where thc 1 revenues" were
spending thc night, remaining300yards
from the house, they sent one of their
number to waru tho "revenues" that a
large force of armed mid dangerous men
\ were not far oir, ami if they valued their
i lives they must leave the county within
three hours.
4. The revenue officers bu t ried off to
Abbeville Court (louie.
f>. The house was not "surrounded."
6. There was no "hand of armed men
of at least forty."
7. The practical jokers did not even
come to the house.
The Abbeville Medium says : "The re
port that tho revenue officers had been
attacked mid fired upon in this county,
near Lowndcsville, has proved to be all
a hoax, and thus more Radical thunder
is destroyed. Tho truth seems to bo that
they were at the house of Mr. Harden
having a good time, and that some
drunken men fired pistols near the house,
but did not shoot at anybody at all.
The revenue officers paid no attention to
it whatever, and said that they were
never treated bettor anywhere in their
lives."
The Ninety-Six Guardian says of the
Revenue disturbances which occurred
recently in Abbeville county :
"The disturbance which occurred near
Calhoun's Mills, in this county, last
week, between a posse of revenue officials
and some citizens of that locality, is un
fortunate in view of tho amnesty arrange
ments made this summer by Governor
Hampton with tho Federal government.
We are not prepared to blame the citi
zens, for we know them to be law-abiding
and peaceable, and we know that the
officers, or .-nine of them, of that squad,
?re good men, acting in the line of their |
limy, in inc absence, theil, ol' definite
knowledge, WO forbear to criticise thc ac
tion of either party. ?int we would Urge
Upon our people thc advisability, evert
thc policy, of strict obedience to the law.
We have no particle of kindesa tor the
onerous burden of revenue taxation.
But it being the law, there can be no
two opinions ns to the expediency, even
thc desirability of observing it strictly."'
THE PICKERS COUNTY BONDS.-A
telegram fron, Washington, doted No
venujier 12, says : In the Supreme Court,
to-day, tho Picketts County, S. C., bona
case wa? argued, Mr. Burlo submitted
AU elab?ralo argument, und Mr. Boyce,

is, whether the ai linn is good Against the

The validity of the bi.mis is .-citied.

SITH KM K (Ol Itt DECISION.

Important (?ui'ntlon SVttlnl.
Thc Supreme Court ha? filed ?t? de?
ci-ion in th- cate of Illili u I la veil port
MT. against Elizabeth Caldwell. The
. ?ii' : i "fi nt ol' interest to the public is
contained in thc following extract :
The liit!i ?iud eighth (.'mund* nf appeal
relate to the jurisdiction of thc Court of
Probate io casen of partition of real es
tate. If thal court ba-* no jurisdiction in i
cases for t be partition of real estate, then
?di its proceedings in relation thereto
were trill and void, and should be tai de
cl it red. Where nothing appears on thc
lace of the proceedings lo show .1 want '
of Imbibi tion, ami the objection is not
made in thc court below, it cannot bc
taken in the Court of Appeals. (Varney
>>. Voeb, ?I lilli, .J o.; (tilt, Iii) was lu |d
iii Hill . .?. Itobeitson. 1 Stroit., p, I, "thc
proceedings of u court of limited juris
diction in ;i ease clearly without ?ts juris
diction are absolutely void, and may bc
so declared win re vi r thc question is pre
sentid, whether directly or collaterally.''
Neither citu failure to take objections at
tho proper time, nor consent, eau give
jurisdiction, (Gullinun iv?. (?alliiiuu, 0
Stroh., J'iT.) except in cases v.here, under
certain circumstance*, the Court might j
luke juridiction. (Millen . l'urne, Hail-j
?.y's 181.) Where thu case is such
that, under no circumstances, could it be
brought within tin; jurisdiction, then ob
jection may be made at any stage of the
proceedings, ?ts was said bv Moses, ('. J.,
in Walker vs. Cresswell," 4 S. <". Kop..,
WM: "We have ie* hesitation in saying
that, where there appears lo bc a ch ar
want nf jurisdiction, ti..- cunt is not pre
vented from so declaring because .he ex
ception is not made by the party against
whom il ?- tn operate." And again :
"When a court takes cognizance of cases
in which the very nature of its organiza
tion prevents it from entertaining the
i->ues made between tho parties, ?iud its
mean? of administration prevent an en
forcement ol'any judgment it tuny there
in pronounce, the objection to its juris
diction may be made nt any tillie."
The objection, therefore, in this case,
although it should properly hare been
:...,.!. ic thc Circuit Court, bas not come
loo late, if, as contended, thc Probate
('oort has no jurisdiction in a case for
the partition of real estate, and the ques
tion must therefore be considered.
Tlie act of the Legislature, Sec. Il,
Kev. Stat., ;*i7'5, does undertake to con
ter such jurisdiction. Hut the court
concurs in the views expressed by Moses,
(.'. .1., in bis separate opinion in Me
Namee ct. Waterbury, -I S. C. Hep.,
1(17 8, that tn determine tho limits of tho
jurisdiction of tho Court nf Probate, wo
must look tn tho constitution, liv which
instrument jurisdiction is conferred. In
this respect Ibo constitution ol' 18(?S
tibiera widely from that ol I7?W. Hy the
latter the judicial power nf the State was
"vested in such superior and inferior
courts of law and equity as thu Legisla
ture shall, from time to timi?, direct and
establish," and it was left to tho Legisla
ture to distribute tile judicial powers
.I.r - -i . ..Mt-l.
UillVIIUnl lin* .TU i.ii -...iii'.-. .-.# Cnt.4l.-Jitatt.
od ; while by tho former (constitution of
1808) tho judicial power is vested in tho
several courts mimed, and in such mu
nicipal ?ind other interior courts us the
(louerai Assembly may doi ni necessary,
but tho jurisdiction nf encli of those
named -amongst them tho Court of Pro
bate-is defined and specified. Tho
jurisdiction thus defined and specified by
tho constitution can 'oe neither enlarged
or diminished hy tho legislative power of
the Slate, which is itself the creature ol'
the constitution, ?ind controlled by the
provisions of that instrument which con
nlitutes fundamental law. Looking to
the constitution, thou, for the limits of
thc jurisdiction of thc Court of Probate,
we lind those limits defined in section
20, article 4, and, as there defined, cases
for tho partition of real estate ure not
embraced. Thc Court of Probate is, un
questionably, a court of inferior and
limited jurisdiction ; when the exorcise
ol" any power is claimed for a court of
that character, it must be shown to exist J
hy express grant, or to bo necessarily
consequent upon some power clearly
given. Thc power boro exorcised by the
Ci.tirt of Probate is not expressly grunt
ed in tin- constitution, nor is it neccssn
lily consequent upon any power which is
given. The conclusion follows that thc
power does not exist.
lt is possible that, bad thc decree of
tho Court of Probate been final in ?Ls
nature, its adoption by the Circuit Court
might have operated as a decree or judg
ment of that court, which, unquestion
ably, has jurisdiction in partition of real
estate. Hut such is not the case, mid
the decision of the Circuit Court, while
it affirms the decision of tho Probate
Court, remands tho ease for further pro
ceedings ?a that court. The judgment
of tho Circuit Court, therefore, failed to
cure the defect of lack of jurisdiction,
and neither judgment can stand.
It is un necessary to consider the re
maining grounds of appeal, as they arc
in effect disposed of by thc conclusion on
tho question of jurisdiction.
The judgment of the Circuit Court is
reversed, und the cuso remanded, with
instructions that the proceedings in tho
Court of Probate be dismissed, so far as
they relate to partition of real estate.

The Wilson-Sunders Duel.
An afluir of honor, known to have aris

of Suinter, culminated in a duel near
Pineville, N. C., in which both parties

tion. Inc recent Congressional elections
have furnished a direct and trustworthy
test ol' the advance thus lar made in Un
practical establishment ol the right of
suffrage, secured by thc Constitution to
the liberated lace in the .Southern Slate.-.
All disturbing influences, real or imagin
ary, had been removed from all ol' these
Slates.
The three constitutional amendments,
which conferred freedom and equality ot
civil and political rights upon the colored
people of the South, were adopted by
thc concurrent action ol the grout body
ol' gootl citizens who maintained the
authority ol' the national government
and the integrity and perpetuity of the
I nion at such a cost nf treasure and
life, as a wise and necessary embodi
ment in the organic law ol' thc just re
sults of Ute war. Thc people of the for
mer slave-holding States accepted these
results, and gave, in every practicable
lorin, assurances lint the thirteenth,
fourteenth and fifteenth amendments,
ami laws passed in pursuance thereof,
should, in good faith, be enforced, rigid
idly and impartially, in U tter and spirit,
to lite end that the humblest citizen,
without distinction of race or color,
should, under them, receive lull and
equal protection in person ami property
and in political rights and privileges, liv
these constitutional miieiiilmcnts, thc
Southern section of the Union obtained
a large increase of political power in
Congress and in the Electoral College
and the conni ry justly expected thal
elections would proceed, us to ihc enfram
ebbed race, upon thc same circumstance!
ol' legal and constitutional Irccdoin am
protection which obtained in all tin
other States of the Cition. The friend:
of law an?l order looked forward to tin
conduct of these elections as offering ti
tiic general judgment of thc country at
important opportunity to measure tin
degree in which thc right of suffragi
could bc exercised by the colored people
and would be respected by their fellow
citizens; buta more general enjoymen
of freedom of snU'ra^e by the eulorel
people, and a more just and generou
protection of that freedom by thc com
inimiti?s of which they form a par
were generally anticipated than th
record ol' the elections discloses. Ii
some of those States in which the color
cd people have been unable to make thei
opinions felt in the elections, the restil
is mainly due to influence? not easil;
measured or remedied by legal protectiot:
but in thc States of Louisiana and Sont
Carolina ut large, and in some partial
lar Congressional District outside t
those States tho records of the election
seem to compel the conclusion that th
righls of the colored voters have bee
overridden, and their participation in th
elections not permitted to bo either gel!
eral or free.
It will be for the Congress for wilie
these (.lections were held io make- sue
examinations into their conduct as ina
be appropriate to determine ibo validit
ul'thc claims of members to their seat:
In the meanwhile it becomes the .July <_

to inquire into and punish violations .

I shall not hesitate to put forth, and I at
unwilling to forego a renewed appeal t
the legislatures, the courts, the executiv
Authorities, and the people of tho Stub
where these wrongs have been perpetra
ed, to give their assistance towards bri nj
ing to justice the offenders and preven
ing a repetition of the crimes. No meal

It is to be observed that the princip:
appropriation made for the Departmci

the following clause": "And for defra;

mses, or any acts amendatory there
ir supplementary thereto."
It is the opinion of thc Attorney-Go
rai thai thc expenses of these procee
ogs will largely excecel the anion
vb ich was thus prodded, and I re
knifidently upon Congress to make nd
piato appropriations to enable thc Eic
nitivc Department to enforce tho law
I respectfully urge upon your ntle
ion that the Congressional elections,
?very district, in a very importa
enso, are justly a matter of political i
crest anil concern throughout t
vhfile country. Each State, every pol
cal party, is entitled to thc share
tower which is conferred by tho lej
md constitutional suffrage. It is t
.ight of every citizen, possessing t
|Ualificalions prescribed by law, to ci
me unintimidsAed ballot, and lo havp I
jal lot honestly counted. So long as t
jxereise of this power and theenjoymc
if this right aro common und oqu
practically as well ns formally, subm
don to the results of tho suffrage will
SCCnrd?d loyally ami cheerfully, and
[he departments of government will f
the true vigor of thc popular will tl
expressed. No temporary or admin
trative interests of government, howe'
urgent of weight, will ever displncc 1
loni of our people in elcfenso of inc prir
ry rights of citizenship, They und
itnnd that the protection of liberty
?mires thc maintenance, in full vigor,
tue manly methods of freo speech, ?
prchg. and freo suffrage, and will atist
ibo full authority of government to
force the laws which arc framed to p
?orve these inestimable rights. The r
terial progress and welfare of thc Stn
Jepend on the protection afforded to iii
citizens. There can bo no penco with,
tucli protection, no prosperity with
peace, anil the whole country is dee
. " I
interested in tlic growth and prosperity
of ?il its parts.
While tiiu country has not yet reached |
complete unity of feeling and reciprocal .
confidence between the communities so i
lately and so seriously estranged, I feel J
an ensoluto assurance that the tendencies
are in that direction, and with increas
ing force. The power of public opinion
will override all political prejudices, and
all sectional or State attachments, in
demanding that all over our wide terri
tory thc name and character ol citizens
of the United States shall mean one and
the -ame thing, and carry with them
unchallenged security and respect.
A favorable view is taken of the re
establishment of a ('hi?ese lega.ion in
thc United States, and mention is made
that a treaty looking to the furtherance
of commercial intercourse between Japan
and America has been made, and will be
submitted for the consideration of the
Senate.
The President then refers briefly to
the Halifax award, saying that the cor
respondence will he laid before Congress.
Reference is made to thc termination
of the insurrection in Cuba, and while
expressing confidence in the strength of
the Mexican government to repress in
cursions into our territory, he says: "I
shall take thc earliest opportunity to re
cognize their ability to restrain ma
rauding parties." lie hopes the coining
international cxibition ill Mexico will
tend to :. better understanding and in
creased commercial intercourse between
the two countries.
After summarizing Sherman's report,
tho President says: "In the prisent
financial condition of thc country, I am
pursuaded the welfare of legitimate busi
ness and industry of every description
will be liest, promoted by abstaining from
all attempts lo make radical changes in
existing financial legislation. Let it be
understood thal during the cuing year
the business of the country ll be un
disturbed by governmental interference
with laws affecting it, and wc may con
fidently expect that resumption ol specie
payments, which will take place at the
appointed time, will be successfully and
easily maintained, and that it will be
followed by a healthful and enduring re
vival ol business prosperity."
The creation of additional Circuit
Judges is recommended as a remedy for
the delay of justice and possible oppres
sion to suitors, occasioned by thc great
increase in the business of thc Supreme
Court and i f the courts in many of the
circuits.
The President concurs in the recom
mendations of the Socretariesof War and
the Interior, that Congress should pro
vide for the organization of a corps of
mounted Indian auxiliaries, to be under
the control of the army, ami to be used
to keep unruly Indians on their reserva
tions or repress disturbances. This
would weaken the restless clement among
thc Indians by giving a number of young
men congenial employment, and would
aid the anny in the task for which its
numerical strength is sometimes found
insufficient. The President thinks, how
ever, that although this force must occa
sionally be employed to prevent or re
press, Indian troubles, wise preparation
should be made to that end, and greater
reliance must be placed on humane and
civilizing agencies for the ultimate solu
tion of the Indian problem. It is alike
our duty and interest to help the Indians
attain the highest degree of civilization
possible for them, and past experience
with many tribes alfords great encour
agement for a continuance of the civil
izing policy. The President expresses
no opinion as to whether or not the con
trol of the Indian service should be
transferred from the Interior to the War
Department, but hopes Congress, in de
ciding that pending question, will not
overlook the considerations above indi
cated.
A SAD ACCIDENT.-The following
particulars arc given of a sad accident
at Edgefield on tue 25th ult. : Charles S.
Harrison, an estimable young man of
about 22 years of age, in company with
Capt. B?langer, a friend of his, were
shooting at a mark with a pistol, and
from sinne cause or other the ramrod be
came detached from the pistol and fell to
the ground.
Capt, Belanger picked it up, and,
whilst trying to replace it on the pistol,
the weapon fired, the ball entering the
forehead of young Harrison, who was
standing by bim, just between and a lit
tle above the eyes. Harrison fell and
died in a few moments. Hewasa young
mau of unexceptional character, and be
loved by all who knew him, and was a
son of Col. Stewart Harrison, who once
tilled tho office of Clerk of Court with so
much distinction and ability for a num
ber of years. Ile leaves a widowed
mother, a brother and a sister, besides a
circle of friends, to weep and mourn over
his early grave.
The Edgefleld Hilles, of which bc was
a loved and honored member,buried bim
this afternoon a -I o'clock with military
honors in the village cemetery, and as
the reverbearating echo of the volley
?hieb they fired over bis gravedied away
among the hills and was lost in thc even
ing breeze, itsigned a mournful requiem to
his departed young spirit and warned his
comrades and friends of tho often too
frequent nod careless handling of fire
inns.
