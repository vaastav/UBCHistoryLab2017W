A FAMOUS HOTEL.
We may now accept as complete the
rehabilltation of Ban Francisco. To
iltght will occur the formal opening of
the reoonstructed Palace hotel. In all
the Wost-perhaps in all the country
there is no hotel more fnlnou than
was the old Palace which fell before
the destroying earthquake elements
when San Franclsco was laid low. It
was a landmark that was as well
known Cs the Golden Gate itself. When
its destruction was reported, there were
thousands of people, the country over.
who felt that they had sustained a per
sonal loss. Now, upon the site of the
old hostelry, has risen a new and
greater palace, which is one of the
largest and most magnlilicent hotels In
the counyf. Ban Francico will now
seem like San Francisco to its visiting
friends.
HONOR WELL SESTOWED.

honor will be paid to the memory of

made possible the development of the
"Oreat American Desert" into the gran

great Inventor will be unveiled in what
is to become a hall of famne devoted to
perpetuating the memory of men who
uave rendered conspicuous rervice in
the world of fannrming. MeCourmick was
wisely chjea as the first of those to
receive recognition.
The time for placing the McCornuick
portrait in the "Hall of arme" was up
prroiately choser, as the present year
marks the centennial of the birth of the
celebrated Inventor. The life of Cyrus
Hall McCormick was a career of plucky
energy and of signal .ueess..l He was
the som et a Virginia farmer who had
himself spent a large part of an active
life in his endeavor to make a machine
to do the work of the sickle and ti:e

took the task as an inheritance. He

The WaUl street view of the message
it thus eXpressed by Henry Clews:
"Neither the president's message nor
the opening of congress created any
dslturbance in the security markets.
On the ountrary President Taft's views
awere in many respects received with
specalt satisfaction. The emphasis
whicht he pl;ced ilon the necessity of
pubtle economtr. .Ideration in regard
to the use of the masimamn tariff and
bis rational attitude regarding railroad
and corporation problems show his de
termination to catty out necessary re
form movements with as little distur
bence to business as possible. This is
naturally reassuring. Congress as yet
showns no signs of breaking out with
antagonistic legislation, although It is
quite apparent that the radicals were
disappointed at the conservative tenor
of President Taft's message. Politi
cally speaking, the situation is hope
ful, for while It is evident that large
corporations must prepare themselves
for more or less governmental reguais
tion, and enforcement of the Sherman
anti-trust law In its present drastic
form may cause some disquiet, still the
outlook in these directions is less
threatening than auring the sometimes
unwisely aggressive policy of the pre
vious administration."

MODIFED
SUPREME COURT CHANGES ITS1
OPINION RELATIVE TO
UNIQUE POINT.
Washington. Dec. 11.--In deciding
yesterday the case of the United
States vs. Bob Celestine. the supreme
court of the United States modified
to some extent its previous judgment
as to the effect of the patenting of
land to Indians.
In the previous case it was virtual
ly held that under the general allot
ment act such a patent was equivalent
to conferring citizenship on an In
dian. but in the opinion handed down
yesterday, which was by Justice
Brewer it was held that cases in
which patents had been granted en
der such conditions the general allot
ment law would not apply.
The Celestine case grew out of the
alleged murder of an Indian by Cele
stine, who is an Indian patentee on
the Ttulalip Indian reservation In the
state of Washington. He was Indict
ed in the United States circult court
for the western district of Washington
and resisted the jurisdiction .of the
court upon the ground of citizenship
received from the allotment by the
government. lie contended, therefore
that he was entitled to trials in the
courts of Washihgton.
The circuit court suetaineb this con
tention. but that decision was reversed
by Justice Brewer's opinion.
Justice Brewer said of Celestine that
although he lud been made a citizen
of the United States and of the state
of Washington it did not follow that
the United States had lost jurisdiction
over him for offenses committed with
in the limits of the reservation.

desks. The type wlbi:'h has fully earned;
that title is called .the deal Sanitary

CAUSE FOR ALARM
Loss of Appetite or Distress After Eat

Appetite Is just a natural desire of

indicates indigestion or dyspepsia.
Over-eating is a habit very dangerous
to a peiosun's good general health. and
insatiable appetite is a common symp

dige-t and assimilate that does you
good. Some of the strongest, heaviest

There is nothing that will create
slckness or cause more trouble than a
disordered stomach. and many people
daily contract serious malndiee simply
through disregard or abuse of tlan
