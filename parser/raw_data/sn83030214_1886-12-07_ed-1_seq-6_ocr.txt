Mr. Kandall'8 sub-committee, which has been
com-idiTing the Sundry Civil Appropriation
bill, has cone!lided to recommend an appro?
priation of $12,5112.000 less than the MtttMtM
called tor. Thia is the measure ot the com?
mittee's eotifleleiu-e in the Adininistr ition. Hut
it ie uol expected that any such reduction will
go ihrough Congress. In fact, the consideration
of this lull in advance nf others, when il should
com? la?t, is merely a trick to gain cheap credit

The President does not mean to be consist?
ent nor just in the S.one-Henton mailer. He
ban appoin ed a successor to Stone, l.ut Renton,
vho devoted ten hours to campaign spcech
nial.ing to every one so occupied by Stone,
is still in ofliec. It may be that the Picsideni
intends o reward 1'icnton for telling the truth.
He deneuiK-ed the President's course as "hum
buggery," and his Administration as "not
entitled to the confidence or reajiect of the
people." According to the terms of the Presi?
dent's letter the ictention of Itenton means thai
liis R-ecrx-h waa of "the right kind." If thai
is his belief, bc is for once in accord with public
sontiincut.
If persons who suffer from embezzling cm
plotos woic as zealous in behalf of justice as
the Chicago firm which caused the arrest in
Pcm of ihe defaulter Ker, thcie would bl fewei
crimes of thai sort committed. In this case
long Irigation followed, and smart lawyers, ii.
behalf of ihe criminal, curried the case up to
the United Sta'.os Supremo Court, which yes?
terday decided thai Ker's conviction was ltg_|
The firm expended over $16,000 to secure the
punishment of ibis ci .ninal. This U in ha.) pv
contrast with the common practice of MM
prunisiiig in order to got back some of the
"swag," as was done in a much more flagrant
case the other day in Chicago.

Jacob's voice. Esau's hand. It is called Soc
ictary Habiting*! report, but it is not a report,
?nd thc gi Miter part of it does not appear to be
Secretary Manning':'. It is not a report, bm
an editorial argument or spc-ecli on the silver
iiuestiou and thc lari IF. 'Ihe balk of the ar
Kament is not in harmony with the most im
portaut specific recommendation of the Secre?
tary, nor wiih the conduct of tho Treasury
Department for the past four months. Ever
since Mr. Marble odored to "ring fire bell in
night," his peculiarities of stylo have lieen
recognized by maloy of his fellow-citi?
zens, who will have no hesitation in living
him credit for the graces of expression in lins
argument. The opinions ace those which Mr.
Marble has come ant ly advocated; they are not
those which have recently governed thc action
of the Department.
So long as Secretary Manning strovo faith?
fully lo prou-ci the public credit, and to shield
the country from thc evil influence of silver
coinage and inllation, it was a pleasure to com?
mend his policy. Then bc refused to issue,
silver certili" a'es at distant points upon de?
posit of any tan kable funds at New-York, bm
lor some months past tlic Tieasuiy Las Ix cn
doing precisely what it then refused to do.
Then he sirovo to limit, so far as his under
s anding of the laws gave him power, the cir
cula ion of silver certificates. Since August I
be has _MIOOM_ the amount of silver certifi?
cate, in ase by about $17,(XX),U00, and thc
.unmiiit of standard siller in use by about
!|I8,00(),(X)0. In the report now submittod, be
locisumcndg Iii? retirement of tho outstanding
legal-tender notes, and tho hm of silver cer
ificates in their room. He proposes to "pay
she unfunded debt with the pie*-ent surplus and
thal which will accrue, and lo issue silver Mr**
ti fica cs in their room, and gold oort lficatos if
need be, without contraction of tho circula?
tion." Fidelity to tho principle* at first es?
poused by the Secretary compels distinct disap?
proval of the coui-c ho has of late pursued,
and of this recommendation to issue $.14(),0(X),
OiX), uiuio or less, of ocrlifica.o- redeemable
only in depreciated coins.
The argument in favor of suspension of sil?
ver coinage ia strong and ci-editable. True,
one hardly sccs how the new tone of Ihe Bnt
tah Government, since Loni Randolph Churchill
took chat gi? of (ts finances, can bo said to pre?
sent a crisis of vital uuportaaoe, Im?11 m
TIIE PhESiniiNrs MESSAGE.
It cannot bo said that thc President's Mes?
sage w as strong as it is long. The Messages
which have thrilled through the land, and kin?
dled the hearts of millions, and changed the
history of the nation, have not always beeu
models of literary style, ami President Cleve?
land s is not such a model. Hut it does not re?
semble thoso memorable Messages in other and
more important respects.
The perfunctory recapitulation of the lead?
ing features of Department aud Bureau re?
ports, even if enlightened and guided by
genius, is apt to be a wearying performance.
But President Cleveland sheds no new light on
the subjects which his subordinates have I
treated. There is more or less commonplace j
remark about each branch of tho service, but i
the most striking characteristic of the Megsago I
is that it adds scarcely a ray of original thought j
or a morsel of information, while ot times the
straining aftor solemn and ponderous phrases
borders on the ludicrous. Even on tho silver
question and the tariff, while the Message sub?
stantially repeats previous recommendations,
it adds so little of vigorous reasoning or uew
thought that it might easily leavo the impres?
sion that the President did uot care particu?
larly what happened.
Brspecting foreign affairs, the Message is
chiefly remarkable for saving much aud telling
nothing. Possibly one phrase may hint ttiat a
new treaty with China Ls forthcoming, but per
hapsnot. Mr. Bayard'shumihaiiug withdrawal
from a mistaken peremptory demand is ignored,
but there is a solemn discourse about " extra?
territorial criminal jurisdiction," as if that had
been the real issue. It is ponderously stated
that negotiations about the ftdierv question are
in progress " witb reasonable hope th it before
the close of the present session of Congress
announcement may be made that an accepta?
ble conclusion his been reached," which is
eon-oling. While legislatnn in execution ol
tho Mexican reciprocity treaty is again urged,
tho tact is mentioned that broader and moro
favorable terms have already beeu accorded bj*
Mexico in recent treaties with other powers.
The President's treatment of the silver ques?
tion is but a taiue repetition of tho nain points
in the Treasury report. He do>s stare, how?
ever, that "every fair and legal e(l'?rt" has
been mado "to distribute this currency*?fil?
ver and sd vcr cert ideates?"among the people."
by withdrawal of sm ill legal- ten.1 rs mil tho
issuingof small sil vei certilic.it -s, "in obedience
to tue will and sentiin-nts off the representa
tives of tho people in the Congress." Nor
will his remarks on the tariff' question
thrill tree-traders with entliu-ia-in. Ho
has au idea that a great "surplus Off our
revenues indicates abnormal nnd ettcp
tional business profits"; considers a tarilT en?
acted in 1SG1 " le.idiug striugs useful ton na?
tion in its infancy'; thinks thu present rate is
in some respect* "actually mire tuan was im?
posed by the grievous burdon willingly borne"
in time of war, and recommends that "the in?
creasing ami iinaecessiry surplus of n itional
income annually accumulating b** released to
the people by an amendment io our revenue
laws wiich snail ehenpen the price of the
necessanon of life and give freer entrance to
such imported materials as by American
labor may be Manufactured into marketable
oominoditieB." A iimreuily he moana free
sugar and free wo ol, but it is hard to b I sure.
The President thinks a bettor foreign mail
service desirable, and with com-iiotidaolo
gravity suggests, " as distinguished from a
grant or subsi ly for the MOTS benefit of any tine
of ti ade or travel," that "whatever outlay may
be required . . should be reg irded as within
the Inuit of legitimate .compensation for such
service." This appea-s to meau thal it is a
subsidy and wrong to pay part of the expense
ot any existing line, but rigiit and economical
to pay a I rger expense to a new line?which
th Pan-Electric brauch of the Administration
should organize nt one*, lt is observed that
" glaring inequality of treatment " is fouud in
the Pensions service, wnieh is not strange, since
the Physical Wreck who is now Commissioner
drnwt tbe largeX pension M record and a large
Minn besides, aud deprives both ot salaries
and pensions men more meritorious, lt is also
noted as " exceedingly strange that the scope
nnd nature oi Civil Service retonn ure so
little understood.' But many of (he Presi?
dent's appoint incuts are calculated to make it
mysterious?and not to strengthen his appeal
for its maintenance.
In truth, it is uot pr cs -Iv a great Message,
nor does it shed Hinch light on events. But in
the main it fairly sets forth the opinions and
i* in- i.ut-- un- .j mi lin-, u ions nt the party which
selected Mr. Cleveland for President.
small hope of a change in British action at
pro?ent is expressed. Nor can ono seo how
Western farmers arc to bo won to the srspen
sion of silver coinage by the argument that
Indian wheat sells in London for -.5 per
cent less MOMO! beoUUM of tlio fall in silver,
if a susiiension of coinage would at once pro?
duce a new and unprecedented fall. But tho
measure urged is supported by many stronger
arguments than these, and it would Ito most
(-ratifying if thc conduct of the TrcLsury Dc
; partmcut had been in harmony wi'.h them. In
1 this world, however, swift preaching and lame
practice are sometimes close allies. It was
Mr. Mannings misfortune '.hat tho exffencfol
of a political campaign required rising prices,
a business boom, and plenty of money in Wall
Street last fall, whether theories were damaged
or not.
'Hie argument for revision of the tariff resls
upon thc assumption that a surplus revenue of
$rJ5,000,000 will involve needless burdens
after thc present fiscal year, that the purchase
of bonds not duo would lie "unnecessary, ex?
travagant and merciless to industrious toil?
ers"; that "while the funded debt s'ands, it is
not wise to discard the ta_\es on whiskey, to?
bacco and beer," but rather to add duties on
((ilTee and tea instead of protective duties; and
tliat tho protective s.vs'em can help only 5 per
cent of the workers, and must harm the rest.
There will be abundant time to answer these
reasonings l-efore Mr. Manning's party cati Ix:
brought to act upon them. But it is important
to plate on recoid his statements, for the time
will come when they will contrast curiously
with his action and that of his party.
T Administration placed itself in a Mm
position at the lieginning, when it attempted to
ignore the fact that four-fifths of the Demo?
crats are at the same time Free Traders and
silver inflationists. As evil associations tta
apt to corrupt, it was safe to pre?
dict that tho Administration of sw h
a party would yield when it was in thc right,
and try to please tbe inflationists in practice,
while pleading eloquently for a sound curri ney.
Tho eloquent plea is repeated in Mr. Man?
ning's report. BM the actual inflation of W ?,
COO.000 in the circulation ou'side tho Treas?
ury during the past four months is an eile.'tiv.

POLITICAL FORCES IS PRANCE
M. de Freycinet is tho sixteenth French
Premier who has held Ihe P-cmicrsl ip
since the downfall of M. Thiers in Mav,
iHl'.i- The first President of tho Repub?
lic was his otn Premier nnd bo resigned-When
the Chamber ol DepatMSgave him a hostile
vote. It was after his overthrow that the Cabi?
net came to have ji r'-coi-U'Z''(l lie.nl known as
the Premier. In the course of neatly foiir'ei'ti
years which have followed Marshal Mac
Main 'ti's election to the Presidency there have
baen sixteen Premiers and nineteen Cabinets.
This in an average of a new Cabinet every
eijrht months. Indeed, if all the occasions on
which Cabinets were ren.ndelled were taken
into the account the average term would be re?
duced to six months. By any method of reck?
oning the Premiership iis shown to bc the irost
unstable of French institutions. M. de Pref
cinet and M. Ferry have been the most success -
fal Premiers in tho maintenance of tiieir
authority, out their terms of ellice have ni ver,
witii one exception, exceeded a year. M. liiim
Oeila, the strongest niau le France, could not
reiam office mme than set.only days. M. Bus
son, sho succeeded him as President of thc
Chamber and w,is generally credited with the
possession of great atlmiiiisir nive Qualities,
pi tived a signal tullun, a* noon a* he was
Premier. The Premiership hun lim-n moat dis
asrousin its etteeis upon political reputations
in France. Hardly an uvailable candidate for
the succession now survives who bas not been
tried atm found wanting.
This decline of the Premiership would bea
startling evidence of tbs instability of republi?
can uml it in ions if lhere were not a correspond
iiii* increase in the political authority ot the
President's ortiee. M. Thiers M Hie timi Presi?
dent was at the mercy of hostile combinations
of legislative factions. The third President
has been elected and re-elected for a constitu?
tional term sud his authority canner be im?
perilled by t.oatile votes in ihe Chambers. A
de:/.*'*, (.ab in I'U may rise and tall during bis
seven years' term, but he himself is secured
against factional strife and political intrigue.
Wnen the third President is compared with
either thc first or the second of his pri'deces-or*
ibo improvement of his political position and
the increase of his Authority are lound lo be
very grant. If the Deputies had been able to
discipline and doffiudo the President ns they
have sixteen Premiers in succession, they
would have succeeded in fatally impairing the
stability of republican institutions. As it is,
die Presidency has increased as the Premier?
ship hat. decreased.
President (Jrevy has always been a sturdy
champion of the doctrine of the political su?
premacy of the legislature. So long us ho lives
the Presidency will tie what it is to-day?_n
oil.ee suiierior in power lo the Premiership, but
with political functions undeveloped and un?
known. The time may ho apprimching wlien
lintier the pressure of au increasing leaeiiouary
minority that ellice will become tue mam bul?
wark of republican institut iona in Frame.
Witb the aid of the Semite tho President nay
eventually come to the rescue of the Cabinet
uud release il limn its present slate of depend?
ence upon the popular Citmuher in executive
udminisilatino. That ls, Frauce may come to
have au American ins.'ead of an Eujrfiab Cabi?
