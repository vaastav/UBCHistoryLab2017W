New Hampshire Visited by * General
Shock.
Dorr*. N.H., Dec. 3.?Early this morning
the 114 inhabitants of Alton Bay were awak
ened by an earthquake shock which jarred the
houses. Many people rushed from their beds.
Crockery and glass ware were broken. Clocks
were stopped at 1:29. A second shock was
more severe than the first. People then rushed
out doors, expecting the houses would tumble
down. The bell on the steamer Mount Wash
ington. in the middle of the bay, was rung. The
?hock was also felt at Alton and Gilford, but
was not so severe.

New Orleans, Dee. 3.?Advices of date
November 7 from Managua, Nicaragua, state
on the highest authority that President Eardoto
Sorcasa would that day approve the treaty
forming a union of the five republics of Nicara

Guatemala under the name of the United States
of Central America. For the first
ten years this union will simply
offensive and defensive alliance
and the president of the union will have charge
only of the diplomatic and foreign relations of
the five republics. At the expiration of that
period the union will be cemented by the adop
tion of a constitution which will embrace all
political, commercial and other relations be
tween the five republics and foreign powers.
A common monetary standard and common
tariff laws will be adopted, but there
will be free trade between the dif
ferent republics. Honduras, Guatemala and
San Salvador have already signed the treaty
and it is understood that Costa Kica will do the
same as soon as Nicaragua has signed. It is
now considered certain that there will be no

most prominent. Tne temper of the market
was also in marked contrast to that of yester
day, the opening being decidedly strong at ad
vances over last night s prices of from V to VC
generally, while Tennessee coal was up 1 and
sugar 1^. These figures had been set too
high, however, and a general reaction took
place, which, in ? few instances, brough; the

most noticeable declines being y. in New

in sugar. There was a rally from this and
Tennessee coal rose 1 and Atchison aud Denver

strong. The upward movement came to a halt
however, toward the end of the hour and at 11

THE CONFESSION OF FAITH.
Interesting Dlscumslon at Today?? Meet
ing of the Washington City Presbytery.
A short sad rather sharp bat interesting dis
cussion took place st the meeting today of the
Washington city presbytery. The subject
of the revision of the confession of fsith was
the topio sad the disonssion was ia some re
spects s continuation of yesterday's debate
when it was decided to come to a vote on the
question of revision at a meeting to be held in
April next. Before adjourning today the pres
bytery decided to hold another meeting on the
third Monday in January. The question,
as it comes before the presbytery
for the general assembly, Is divided into two:
First, whether a revision is desired; and sec
ond, what changes are to be suggested. To
answer the secoud question the matter was re
ferred to a commitlte consisting of Rev. lJr.
Hamlin. ex-Justice William Strong, G. W. N.
Curtis and Rev. Dr. Hittinger. The committee
having prepared its report it was read by Dr.
Hamlin. It was as follows:
1KPORT or TBE BPKCIAI OOBOHtt
We recommend that the presbytery of Wash
ington city answer the second question of the
general assembly's overture on the revision of
the confession of faith, ss follows: We do not
desire any sweeping revision of the confession
of faith, nor such as would eliminate from it
the system of doctrine known as Calvanism,
nor such as would throw it out of harmony
with other Presbyterian churches. We recog
nize, with profound gratitude to God,
the immense service of our confession
to a multitude of believers, to civil
freedom and to the world at Urge.
We appreciate its logical strength and sym
metry and its uuequaled statement of most of
the great doctrines of our holy religion. We
find in it, however, certain controversial utter
ances which do not properly belong in such a
document and certain unscriptural or
scriptural statement*. These we desire to nave
expunged. We find, also, lack of just balance
and relationship of truths which we desire
remedied by a change of emphasis, and espec
ially we find no adequate statement of the love
of God for all mankind. His abundant provision
for the salvation of all in the atonement ot His
Son and His offer of mercy and grace to every
creature. This we desire to see prominently
inserted.
CHANGES SrOOXSTXD.
The report then proceeds by chapter and sec
tion to enumerate the changes which ought to
be made to carry out the ideas of the commit
tee as expressed in the report. There are
eighteen changes suggested and all of them
with the exception of six are approved by tne
entire committee. From these six changes
Rev. Dr. Bittinger files his dissent. Some of
the changes so modify the confession
that it will not tea<!h the bond
age of the will, so guard the imputation
of sin and righteousness as to relieve it of all
impressions of legal fiction, and leave out the
words "papist or other idolatries" and also all
other controversial utterances in regard to the
church of Rome. The report recommends that
s clause be inserted giving the truth contaiued
in such verses of the liible as "God loved the
world," Ac., and a statement of the obligations
and privileges of the church of Christ to go
into all the world and preach the gospel to
every creature. The report was ordered to be
printed, and it is the intention to act upon it
at the spring meeting.
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PROPOSED CHANOE.
In discussing the subject of revision Rev. Dr.
Bar tie tt said that the proposed change was a
most important one in tho history of the church.
It seemed to him that there was a tendency on
the part of those opposed to any change to
think that they were tne only true-blue Presby
terians while the other side were the destroyers
of the faith. But he said this was the spirit
that opposed itself to every reform and
every movement forward. To his mind
it was prima facie evidence
that the book needed revision because it was
prepared 250 years ago. The world has changed
since then. The age was a barbarous one com
paratively when the book was prepared. Ihe
arguments opposed to any change were ropes
of logic fastened to the hind end of the train
of progress. The throttle of tho engine
would be pulled and everybody would
be hurried along with it. Statistics
were often quoted to show how much the
church was doing. They also might be quoted
to show how little was done compared with
what ought to be done. He favored all the sug
gestions contained in the report. He was in
favor of growth and a movement of this kind
was a preparation for a larger life and greater
activity. The Presbyterian church, he said,
had stood long enough with its back to the
morning piping psaans to tho sunset He bo
lieved that God was in this movement and that
the church was going forward to a glorious fu
ture.
JTUOE DBASE REPLIES.
In reply Judge Drake referred to the self
complacency of those who favored the revision
because they bolieve that all the progress of the
world has been toward their wav of thinking.
It must not be imagined, he said, that people
who objected to having the foundations of their
faith overturned were hostile to the light.
VIEWS or DR. SUNDERLAND.
The fundamental truths and principles which
underly all civilization and progress ought, in
tho opinion of Rev. Dr. Sunderland, the ne*t
speaker, to be preserved while looking forward
and marching forward in the ranks of progress.
There is danger in the rebound from conserv
atism, he said, in flying off to dreams and fan
tasies He thought that the church should re
main "true to its principles, and spoke of the
service to the world done by Calvin and his
teachings. Anv movement looking to a charge
in fundamental beliefs he thought ought to Le
carefullv considered. . ..
Taking the floor again Rev. Dr. Bartlett cited
the conservative Dr. McCosh as in favor of re
vision, and in reference to the objection raised
bv his opinion he spoke of the prehistoric ani
mal the megatherium,which was provided with
a huge mouth, but whose function was to
catch ants. He thought the fears aiul objec
tions of the opponents of revision resembled
the megatherium. . . ? ... ..
Rev. Dr. Fullerton spoke briefly and then the
presbytery adjourned.

Two Lives Lost at Sea.
New Tore, Dec. 3.?The bark Christian
Schriver, from Buenos Ayres, reports that yes
terday at the Delaware breakwater she passed
two dead bodies. One of the bodies was that
of a man floating on a life raft, the other was
that of a woman floating near the raft with
a life preserver about her. It is not known
to what vessel the bodies belonged.
The report in shipping circles in this city
occasioned no little excitement. Upon the
maritime exchange the opinion prevailed that
the raft and bodies had come from the Old
Dominion steamship Manhattan, which went
down in a collision with the schooner
Agnes Manning a few weeks ago. The
Old Dominion agents, however, sny that there
was no woman on their vessel. Despite this
statement old seamen insist that the raft came
from the Manhattan. They say that it is fre
quently the case that a woman is smuggled on
board of a vessel by the captain and her name
is kept off the manifest

opinions which are really worth anything, are
not to be had just now. Years ago, when the

ESTIMATES AND APPROPRIATIONS
1 he Differences Shown In a Statement
Prcpurcdat the CapitoL
The clerks to the committees of appropria
tions of the Senate and House have prepared
a comparative table of estimates aud appro
priations. It shows that the total regular and
permanent estimates for 1890 were <385,976,146,
or $35,778,226 less than those, for 1891. The
excess of revenues last year over the appropria
tions was 853,532,5X1, while the excess of esti
mate revenues over estimated appropriations
(exclusive of deficiencies and miscellaneous)
for 1891 is $43,571,022. The amount of esti
mated revenues for 1891 is $385,000,000, and
this added to #65,414.337, tho amount of esti
mated postal revenue, makos the total estimates
of revenues for 1891 amount to $450,414,387.
Ihe net increase of estimates for 1891
over 1890 is ?20.867,168, the net in
crease of estimates for 1891 over
appropriations (exclusive of deficiencies and
miscellaneous; for 1890 is *38,092,112, and ths
total estimates of regular and permanent annual
appropriations for 1891 are $406,843,315. There
are no estimates mad- |by the oommittees for
river and harbor appropriations for 1891, aud
Congress will u.ive to take up directly those
submitted by tho chief of engineers in his
annual report. The estimate for the District

MOXST XEEDED TO EXECUTE TU LAW.
The civil service oommiasion has submitted
to the President its annual report, and in It
?bow* how the intern which the law provide*
(or has been Spread to such an extent that
more than one-fourth of the positions under
the government are now protected by it Vari
ous minor amendments to the law are reoom
mended and an increase in the commission's
clerical force is said to be urgently needed,
because the present foroe can barely keep the
lists of eligible* filled. "There mar,"
say* the report, referring to this con
dition of affairs, "be a division of
opinion as to whether there should or should
not be a civil service law at all, but surely
there can be none as to its being properly
enforced while on the statute book and as to
the cotnmisHion's being given sufficient means
to enforce it. Common honesty demands that
while the law exists there be sufficient money
appropriated to carry it into effect. Consider
ing the vital importance of the work, the
amount that is needed is absolutely insignifi
cant?so insignificant that there can be no
hesitation in granting it on the score of
economy."
This is followed up by an appeal for an ad
ditional sum of #18,000.
THE CHARACTER OF THE EXAMINATIONS.
Some space is devoted to an argument on the
merit system. "It seems worth while to an
swor," the report says, "one or two of the ac
cusations often brought against the merit sys
tem by its opponents. These accusations have
been so incessantly repeated that many people
hare finally oome to believe them.
? One of these accusations is that the exami
nations are of such I character as to favor
"boys fresh from school" at the expense of
men of maturer age, experience and capacity.
This is simply incorrect. In the last report of
the commission full tables bearing on the sub
ject are given. By these it is shown that nearly
two-thirds of the applicants for examination
succeed in passing, and that of those passing
about two-fifths are appointed, the figures prov
ing* by the way, that those who have had a
good common school education do about as
well as those who have graduated from college.
A glance at these table.* shows that the average
age of those passing the examinations for the
ordinary governmental positions, such as clerk,
copyist, letter carrier and the like, is about
twenty-eight years. In other words, the
examinations for these positions are especially
suited not to school boys, but to men in tlie
prime of life, with experience of the world,
who have left school for at least ten years. The
most common accusation, however, is that the
examinations are "scholastic," or of an "im
practicable" character; that, as is often as
serted, the commission does not give practical
teHts, but auks questions "about the sciences."
or, at least, on irrelevant subjects. All such
statements as these are without foundation;
and if those who make them do so in good faith
it is only because they have not tuken the
trouble to ascertain the facts. As a matter of
fact, special care is taken to have the examina
tions as practical in character as possible, and
to test each candidate on precisely those sub
jects demanded by the character of the work
in the branch of the service to which he is seek
ing admission. The commission strongly ob
jects to irrelevant questions, and surely there
can be no questions more irrelevant to a man's
duties as clerk or letter carrier than are in
quiries as to how he voted at the last election
and how strong his political backing is; and
these are precisely the questions that many of
the men who thus object to the examinations
ss "impractical" are in reality desirous of
asking.
TESTS or VARIOUS KINDS.
"Examinations are held for scores of differ
ent places, and for each place appropriate tests
are provided. Thus, it is necessary for an as
sistant chemist to know something of chemis
try, and for au assistant astronomer to know
something of astronomy; and applicants for
sueb positions are questioned accordingly. A
would-be stenographer and type writer is ex
amined in stenography and type writing. But
the great bulk or applicants?probably over 90
per ceut?apply for positions as clerk, copyist,
letter carrier and the like, and the examina
tions for these positions are those by which the
system can best be tested. For each of these
positions there is a plain, practical, com
non-souho examination, such as would appear
to the average intelligence to be best suited to
find out the men who possess in the highest
degree the qualitiei needed. A copyist is ex?
aniined on but four subjects?spelling, pen
manship, elementary arithmetic and copying
from dictation, from plain copy and from a
rough draft. His duties as a copyist make it
nocossary for him to spell well, to write a good,
legible hand, to solve simple problems in arith
metic aud to make a clear, neat-looking copy
of a firs; draft o! a letter which is filled
with interlineations i>nd erasures; and ac
cordingly these four points are the very
ones on which he is examined. A clerk's ex
amination is a little hurtle.-, for besides the
above-mentioned subjects he is required to
show that he can write an intelligent letter on
some given topic, that he can turn uiigram
matical sentences into good English, that he
knows how to keep accounts, and finally that
he knows something of United States geog
raphy, government and history. Every ques
tion, except the last, has a direct bearing upon
the duties to which the clerk will be put
as soon as he has been appointed. The
only objection that can possibly be
made is to the questions about the geography
and history of the United States (and no other
questions are asked in history and geography);
but these combined never count for more than
five per ceut in the examination, so that an ap
plicant need not answer them at all, and may
yet attain an average of 'J5 per cent. More
over, these questions are a test of a man's gen
eral intelligence. Every good American citizen
ought to possess a rudimentary knowledge of
his country's history, geography and govern
ment.
minor POSITIONS.
Examinations for all the ordinary minor po
sitions are based upon the two for clerk and
copyist, some of the question* being dropped
and others substituted in each case according
to the character of the work m the special
place applied for. Thus, a letter carrier has
to show good knowledge of the local geogra
phy of his vicinity?its railway stations, big
commercial buildings, and the like. Or, again,
a railway mail clerk has to show acquaintance
with the railway systems of hi* state and sec
tion, and to make it evident that he can read
off a large number of addresses with speed and
accuracy.
Such are fair samples of the tests applied to
the great majority of the candidate* who come
before the examining boards, and if questions
on the point* indicated above are not practical
and pertinent to the dutie* of the position*
sought for then it would be hard to kuow what
questions are.
Occasionally some one, in attacking the ex
aminations as impractical or as being too se
vere and scholastic in ohsracter, quote* a ques
tion asked one class and speaks as if it was
asked another. For instance, be will speak as
if a clerk had been aaked questions in geology
or a copyist questions in chemistry. If he doe*
not do this he invents a series of questions,
which he then proceeds to comment on as if
they were genuine and takes great satisfaction
in demolishing a straw antagonist who has no
existence save in his own imagination.
"In the report of the commission printed last
June a complete serie* of the questions asked
in a variety of examinations was given. These
have now been before the public for six months,
and yet, as far as is known to the commission,
no one has ventured to attack them or to spec
ify such ss are impractical and improper.
Doubtless out of the thousands of question*
continually prepared there occasionally occur
some which it would be better to leave un
asked; bftt the commission challenges any one
to produce a series of examinatian papers, now
or recently in use, in which the questions are
not proper and practical as a whole.
OOMMOX SEXBE TESTS.
"The commission emphatically asserts that
the examinations are of snch a character as to
afford good common-sense business tests of ths
fitness of the applicants for the special duties
of their positions; that in Washington itself the
law is faithfully and honestly sxecuted, without
fear or favor, all competitors, without regard
to party, standing an equal chance, and being
examined, marked, and certified with impartial
justice, while the efforts to attain similar re
sults In the local offlces are being rewarded by
a constantly increasing measure of success.
Finally, it points to that best of test, experi
ence, as clearly showing that the offices in
which the merit system has been most fairly
tried are precisely the offices in which the best
public work has been done."

time it is the mysterious disappearance of tbe
village shoe maker, a young man named Charles
Haggenmaksr. He formerly lived in Onion*
town and sometime last spring he vent to
Bennings and opened a shoe shop in the rear
of Kaiser's store at the cross-roads, not
far from the drove yard. Being the
only shoemaker in that section he soon bnilt
np a good trade and had more work than he
sould do. He rented a house near the rail
road station and lived there vith his wife and
two children. Haggentnaker and hi* wife
lived together happily, and almost every
evening He was out with his little chi.dren.
MIKSISO sixes LAST WESMsDAY.
Last Wednesday morning hs left home and
went to his shop. He left the key in Kaiser's
store with the clerk, telling him that he could
deliver any work th&t might be called for.
When he left tbe shop he took hi* shot gun with
him and said he was going to the city to have
it repaired. When evening came anil he had
not returned his wife became alarmed and
made inquiries about her husband. bhe
learned that ho left Bennings in one
of the stages and went to the citv. He failed
to return home that night and kin wife com
municated with her father-in-law in Union town.
Inquiries have been made, but thus far no one
has been seen who has heard or seen anything
of the missing man since he reached this city
Wednesday evening.
DESCKITTION or Tint KIBSIKO MAX.
He is about twenty-live years old. 6 feet 8
inches high and stonily built He wore a black
suit, light overcoat and derby hat when he left
home. It is thought by some persons that the
missing man started to walk home after th?
stages stopped running Wednesday night and
was waylaia. As the missing man had not re
turned home yesterday the police were notified
of his disappearance and requested to lookout
for him.
When a Stab reporter ealled at his home
this morning his wife was not there, but the
reporter learned in the neighborhood that she
does not think that her hnsbaud has been foully
