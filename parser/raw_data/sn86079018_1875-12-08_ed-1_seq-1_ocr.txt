SYNOPSIS OP THE
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
[Telegraphed to the Associated Press]
Washington, Dec. 7.—The message opeos: "In
submitting my seventh annual message to Con
gress, in the Centennial year of our national ex
istence as a free and independent people, it
affotds me great pleasure to recur to the ad
vancement that has been made from the time of
the Colonies one hundred years ago. W e were
then a people numbering only three millions;
now we number more than forty.
"The industrieBwe re confined almost exclusive
ly to the tillage of the soil; now manufactures
absorb much of the labor of the country, our
liberties remain unimpaired, the bondsmen have
been freed from slavery, and we have become
possessed of the respect, if not the friendship, of
all civilized nations. '
Graphic and well-worded details fallow. The
President earnestly reminds them that a Consti
tutional amendment be submitted to the legisla
tures, making it the duty of each State to estab
lish, and torever maintain, free public schools,
adequate to the education of all child
ren in elementary branches within their
respective limits, irrespective of sex, color, birth
place or religion, forbidding-the teaching in said
school of religious, Atheistic or Pagan tenets,
and prohibiting the granting of any school funds
or school taxes, or any part thereof, either by
legislative, municipal or other authority, for the
benefit, or in aid, direotly or indirectly, of any
religious sect or denomination,or in aid or for the
benefit of any other object of any nature or kind
whatever. . .. ..
He alludes to the importance of correcting the
evp of vast amounts of nutaxed church property,
and estimates that by 1890, if unchecked, this
property will reach a sum exceeding three thou
sand million dollars. He would suggest the tax
ation of all property equally, excepti g only the
liât resting-places of the dead. Relations with
most foreign powers continue on a satisfactory
and friend y looting. The President is happy to
announce t' e passage of an aot by the General
Certes of Portugal, abolishing slavery in the
Coloeies. . ., .
The past year has furnished no evidence of an
approaching termination of the ruinous conflict
which has been raging for seven years in Cuba.

United States, and the insecurity of property
owned by citizens of the United States in Cuba.
He had hoped 8pain would be enabled to esUb

affairs of an „ther and a friendly nation, he
natie-ntlv and auxiou-ly awaited the progress

my opinion, impracticable and indeleneible, the

not at this time recommend the adoption of any
.measure of intervention." He adds: "Per

interests of the United States and of its citizens

been subjected by the difficulties of the questions

trials by a corps of engineers, and a permanent
organization for the signal corps. The condition
of onr navy at this time, he says, is a source of
satisfaction. Reviewing the details of defects as
compared with other nations, he says neither our
continental situation nor our foreign policy re
quire that we should have a large nunuier of
these powerful cruising iron-clads, while our situ
ation and the na.ureof our ports combine to make
those of other nations but little dangerous to us
under any circumstances. We have fifty war
ships, including fifteen iron-clads, now in hand
on the Atlantic coast. .... mi
The postal service is entirely satisfactory, lhe
President suggests the power of exclusion of
B}6FclubDdi&? tiom the mails. The method of
treating the Indians adopted at the beginning of
my first term has been steadily pursued with
satisfactory and encouraging results, and has
been productive of ev.dent improvement in the
condition of that race, and will be continued
with such modifications as experience may in
dicate to be necessary. He speaks cheermgly
and liberally regarding the Centennial.
He says of the Bureau of Agriculture that it
has accomplished much in diseominating useful
knowledge to the agriculturist, and also in intro
ducing new and useful productions, adapted to
our climate, and worthy of the continued encour
agement of the government. He characterizes
the condition of affairs in Utah as scandalous;
as an institution, polygamy should be banished
from the land. " As this will be the last message
I shall have the honor of submitting to Congress
before my successor is chosen, I will repeat or re
capitulate the questions which I deem of vital
importance, which may be legislated upon and
settled at this session."
I. That the States shall be required to afford
the opportunity of a good comm on school edu
eation to every child within their limits.
2 No sectarian tenets shall ever be taught in
any school supported, in whole or in part, by the
State or natioD, or the proceeds of any tax levied
upon any community. Make education compul
