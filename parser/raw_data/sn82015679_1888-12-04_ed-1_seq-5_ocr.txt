THE INDIANAPOLIS JOURNAL, TUESDAY, DECEMBElc 4, 1888,
xtra share of felicitations, it being centrally
conceded on the floor that the next House will
te Kepublican, with from three to 8Tea ma
jority. The Speaker's desk wm ornamented with a
bandsome floral piece, while other Drominent
member were not forcottea by their friends,
and numerous floral desiens aided a pleating
feature to the scene.
When Mr. Kendall, of Pennsylvania, entered
the chamber, which he did at a few moments
before noon, he was surrounded by his friends
cesirous of expressme their pleasure at eeeine
him once more able to resume his concessional
duties. At precisely 12 o'clock the fall of the
rarel stilled the tumult which existed in the
hall, and silence reicned while Mr. Milburn, the
chaplaic, offered the following prayer:
Oh, God. we bless Thee that, since the adjournment
r f the lat session, not a member of the House has
been called away by death, and that the representa
tives cf the people are returned to their seats in safe
tr. peace and health. Spread oTer us, we beseach
Thee, the khadow of Thy wings. anl continue to keep
usuiiier Tby sacred protection. May all the delii
er at ions of thi session be marked by a profound zeal
for the safety, honor and welfare of the Nation, by a
wise and sound judgment, kiadlireis of spirit and
urbanity of manner.
The roll of members was then ealled, and the
hum of conversation broke out afresh. Dunne
the progress of the rail Mrs. Cleveland entered
the executive gallery, and became an attentive
spectator. The rail developed tne presence of
2:;6 members -there being eichty-eight ab
sentees. On motion of Mr. Mills, cf Texas, a resolution
was adopted directing the Clerk to inform the
Senate that a quorum of the House had np-'
pe&red, and the House was ready to proceed to
0US1CS3S.
In accordance with a resolution adopted on
motion of Mr. Holman, of Indiana, tbe Speaker
appointed Messru. Holman. of Indiana; Turner,
of Georgia, and O'Xeall. of Pennsylvania, as a
committee to join a similar committer appointed
bv the Senate to wait upon the President, and
inform him that Coneresa was ready to receive
any communication he roieht desire to transmit.
The House then, at 12 o'clock, took a recess
for an hour. After the recess, Mr. Holman an
nounced that the committee to wait upon the
President had performed that duty, and that
the President would communicate wita Con
gress forthwith,
Mr. Pruden, one of the President's secretaries,
vis then announced, and the annual messaee
was delivered to the House and immediately
read by the clerk.
That portion cf the messape in which tho
President treats of the tariff question was lis
tened to attentively by members on both aides
of the House. Now and then a smile, more of
triumph than of derision, would appear upon the
face of some enthusiastic Republican, but the
silence was not broken until the clerk read in a
clear voice:
The cause for which the battle is wajed is com
prised within lines clearly and distinctly defined. It
thould never be compromised. It is the people
raue.
The President's reference to the Saekville
West incident provoked a laugh from the 'Re
publican side of the house, but do counter dem
onstration wan made by the Democrats. From
tnis point, interest in the message slackened.
Mr. Mills was the only member who paid the
slightest attention to the further reading, and
the noise of conversation was so greet that this
was no easy taek. When, at 3:15, the reading
was completed, Mr. Mills offered a resolution,
which was a creed to, referring the message to
the committee of the whole, and proriding for
its printing. Adjourned.
MLNOK MATTERS.
A TIp Concerning the President's Message
That Proved Worthless,
fpeciai to the IndlanaDvlU Joutcu.
Washington, Dec. 3. Before the President's
messatre was received at the House, to-day, one
cf the 'legislative agents' of a Wall-street con
cern passed the word around the lobbies that
tho message would contain a reference to the
Outhwaite bill for the extension of the Pacifio
railroad bonded debt. He added that he had
an intimation, but he was not positive, that the
reference would be favorable to the bilh "Now,'
laid this gentleman, "if this proves to be true,
Union Pacific will te a pood stock to buy,
and I think it safe to say
that it will jump at least sis
points. If you have any spare cash look oat
for the messsce and govern yoarself according
ly." In response to this tip those who were ad
vised of what to expect eagerlr scanned the
copies of the message which Mr. Pruden dis
tributed, in the hope of finding a "pointer." Tne
promised paragraph was mission, and the tip
was worthless. As a result there were several
disappointed Congressmen and House em
ployes who saw a faint opportunity to recoup
the losses sustained by betting upon the wrong
man

CONGRESSIONAL VIEWS.
Opinions or Democrats and Kepuhlicsns on
Cleveland's Lut Menage.
peciI to the Indisnavolis Journal.
Washington, Dec. 3. No better commentary
on President Cleveland's message could be de
sired than that given by the members of the
House daring the readine of the document, this
afternoon, when the Democrats applauded cer
tain features, and the Republicans hissed other
portions. When the reference to the surplus in
the treasury as not being intended to force free
trade was read, the Democrats immediately be-
pan a vieoroua applause, and the Republicans
gave Tent to a stage laugh that drowned the
hand-clapping. The contrast between the dem
onstrations on the two sides was so great that,
involuntarily, almost, every eyo turned toward
Mrs. Cleveland and her mother, who sat on the
front seat in the diplomatic callery. They
looked serions. With very few exciptions and
those are among the protectionist Democrats
opinions as to the merits of the messsce
are confined within party lines. The
Democrats generally are gisd that the President
has again proclaimed in favor of free
trade, and, &s Chairman Mills pnt it this 6ren
in?, "are proud to see the President still flying
the flag of reform.7 Mr. Mills does not believe
the free-trade utterances of the President in his
message a year ago had anything to do with the
change of public opinion as to the aims of the
Democratic party, or that they contributed to
Mr. Cleveland's defeat He heartily indorsed
all the President has ever said about tariff re
form and free trade.
The two Breckinridges, who are Democratic
members of the House committee on ways
and means, heartily applauded the sentiment of
the message as it was read, and declared that it
is the best document ever sent to Congress.
They, too, are gratified to see that Mr. Cleve
land's stand on the tariff has not been shaken
by the reeent election. They join Mr. Mills in
declaring that the representatives of the Demo
cratic party in Congress do not intend to alter
or amend their tariff platform, but say it will
stand as a land-mark for future campaigns.
They are in favor of simply reaffirming the
platform m the next struggle for the presi
dency. Senator Ransom, of North Carolina, expressed
the views of the Democrats in the tipper branch
of Concress when he said: (iIt is the ablest of
them all, and shows that our leader is standing
by the guns."
The Republicans in both bouses use some
very vieorous language in denouncing the mes
sage. Senator Allison, this evening, said: ''It is
unpatriotic'' The Senator had special reference
to the second paragraph in the message, which
casts 6erions doubt upon the wisdom of the
foundation of our Republic, because it is
"founded upon the freedom of the people He
thinks the President has struek a very cruel
blow at the American form of government,
simply because its citizens did not retain him in
power.
Senator Sherman said: "It contains nothing
sew, except certain forms of complaint."
Senator Cnllora: "Mr. Cleveland seems de
termined to eo out with a bluster. He is disap
pointed, scolds severely, and appears to doobt
not only the wisdom of the present people, but
the framers of our Constitution."
Representative McKinloy. of Ohio, said: "It
is a post-mortem examination of the Democratic
platform."
General Grosvenor, also of Ohio, said: "The
message is a motion for a new .trial, bat the
court has no jurisdiction, and the verdict will
have to stand."
These views give a good idea of those
expressed by all men in Congress who have,
so far, given utterance to their opinions
of the message. In some quarters there
is great indignation over the commnnistie
and the anarchistio sentiment of the President,
and several men in Congress go so far as to say
that Johann Most and his followers can find
texts in the messsce to fire the hearts of their
converts to the utmost and for years to come.
The soldiers are also indignant; they regard the
language of the President where he refers to pen
sions as "gratuities, granted upon no other
real ground than the needy condition of the ap
plicant, or for reasons less valid." as an ubneces
ssry insult to the veterans; but they add that it
is only in the line that he has followed ever
since he went to the White House, and that in
the future it will eause the soidiers to stand
mere solidly together than they have ever
stood.
TKESS COMMENT.
Chicago Editors Unable to Agree as to the
Merita of the Document.
Chicago, Dec. 3. The Herald (Dem. ), to
morrow, in commenting on the President's mes
sage, will say: "There is not a passage in this
important and aigniflcant state paper but will
impress the country with a sense that Grover
Cleveland, as President, was the right man in
the right place."
The Times (Dem.) will say: "Many millions
of citizen?, reading this last state paper cf
Cleveland's, will find themselves deeply regret
ting the failure to ro-elect hia to the presi
dency." The News (Ind. Rep.) will say: "No one but
a hide-bound partisan can fail to be aroused to
admiration of the man who, in the hour of po
litical defeat, can still keep his rudder trne and
absolutely suppress all personal feeling in hia
last official utterance. If a Democrat, he must
be proud of the good statesmanship and earnest
striving for the best interests of the country
which marks its every line. If a Republican,
te can do no less than hope that his chosen chief
may come as well out of the fray with as heroic
port and undaunted mien, in lh'J'2, as Cleveland
in these closing days of 18S3."
Tho Tribune will say: "The message con
tains neither new thought nor suggestions, ex
cept on the tariff question, where the President
has, in the past year, made a prodigious stride
from tariff reform to naked, absolute free
trade."
The Inter-Ocean will ssy the message con
trasts sharply with the policy adopted a year
ago. when the President could think of
nothing but the tariff. On that
question the Inter Ocean comments:
"That part of his messsge might have been
written by Manton Marble, Joseph Medill,
Heory Watterson, or any other free-trader ac
customed to think, pen in band. In fact, the
New York World, the Louisville Courier Jour
nal and the Chicaso Tribune have said substan
tially the same thing as one finds in this mea
sa;e over and over a;ain, and they were stale
before thsy said them the first time."
Tli Washington Tapers.
Washington. Dec. 3. The Post, to-morrow.
will say: "The President discusses the tariff
with all the earnestness that characterized hia
late specific message on that subject, and which,
in spite of all reverses, he still maintains is the
great Issue before the country. To be con
sistent with himself it was necessary that, even
in the face of an adverse popular verdict, he
should adhere to a cause whieb he deliberately
and defiantly ma!e the supreme test of his ad
ministration. But the situation, bad as it is, is
not wholly due to the tariff. There are other
and craver ills to be confronted and overcome.
So far ae the tariff is concerned we have
full faith thst its inequalities and exactions,
which are now universally conceded, will soon
be adjusted upon a satisfactory lasts. The
sooner the question is taken out of partisan
politics the better. The silence of the message
with regard to civil-service reform is lis notable
and peculiar feature. It is not to be assumed
that the President has lost faith in the reform,
but is it not a fair presnmption that he has lost
faith in reformers. Or, perhap, the more
natural construction to be placed upon his ap
parent abandonment of the cause is that, having
brought the civil-servico to its present high po
sition, he prefers not to argue the question of
its continuance with the incoming administra
tion. His own responsibility in this matter is
well-nieh at an end."
Of the President's message, the Evening Star
says: "President Cleveland's last annual mes
sage is in tone refreshingly direct and vigorous.
No suggestion of a compromise is to be found in
the discussion of the lost cause lost for a time,
at least of a tariff for revenue only. The lan
guage employed is pointed rather than smoothly
diplomatic Criticism cf congressional action,
or inaction, is bluntly expressed, and not
merely suggested, after the customary
fashion. The President roundly lectures
the legislative branch of the government for
doing what it should not do and leaving undone
those things which it ought to do. In short, the
administration gees down with colors flying,
and with the captain on deck shouting defiance
at the enemy. Congress will not relish so palp
able a lecture from the retiring executive, and
the circumstances of its delivery will probably
rob it of most of its effect as a recommendation
to that body, whatever influence upon publio
opinion may be accomplished."
In,rka Vtpor and Snlrlt.
Baltimore, Md., Dec 3. The American will
eay to-morrow: "The message lacks the vigor,
spirit and individuality heretofore conspicuous
in his official writings, and conveys the im
pression that the President has suddenly tired
o! his duties and has relaxed his grip upon tho
helm of the old ship of state. He nowhere
rises above the commonplace, except in his in
troduction, which is a labored, pessimistic wail
over his defeat in November, and a deepairing
appeal to his scattered partisans to raily under
the eld Hag of free trade, and save the country
from imaginary perils cot suggested by any ex
isting condition.'
Had Rhetoric and Communism.
Rochestek. N. Y.. Dec. 3. The Democrat and
Chronicle (Rep.) will say to-morrow in part of
the President's message: "His advocacy of so
called tariff reform is a sad jumble of bad
rhetoric and wild communism. Herr Most, in
his rhapsodies, coold hardlv outrun the an
archic postulates which Grover Cleveland
gravely propounds to the American people in
this, happily, his last message to the Congress."
The Country Is Not Interested.
Cincinnati, O., Dec 3. Mr. Halstead, of the
Commercial Gazette, hr.ving been asked by the
Associated Press correspondent for his editorial
opinion of the President's message, said: "I
have cot read it, and never expect to read it.
As for what it is alleged to say, it is highly un
important if true a pretentious bulk of empti
ness. The country h&s no serious interest in it."
English Opinion of tho Document.
London, Deo. 3. The Morning Post, com
menting on the President's message, says: "If
Americans are really inclined to resume negoti
ations on the subject of fisheries, they will find
the English ministers animated only by a sin
cere desire to promote the satisfactory and final
adjustment which Mr. Cleveland mentions.
While unable to hold the same opinion as Mr.
Cleveland as to -what the just demands of
comity are, the Post thinks it would be better if
England would look to the disposition of Amort
can statesman in the future rather than to
wrangle over the past.''
The Daily News says that it would express
more regret for Mr. Cleveland's acrimonious ref
erence to the dismissal of Lord Sackvillo if Lord
Salisbury had" cot set the example. Sir. Cleve
land, it thinks, evidently has Lord Salisbury's
fatal gift of a bitter tongue. In other respects
the message seems to bo the most powerful per
formance which the President has accomplished
namely, the feat of sayinc something both
new and true about protection. The News
further remarks that the musiaeo is likely to
become a household word for the orator of
Hyde Park aod Clarkenwelh The fisheries
question, it thinks, will have a smaller chance
for settlement nnder Mr. Harrison than under
Mr. Cleveland, but having only ono great party
to rleaee the chances for a judgment on its
merits may be greatly improved.
The Standard says: "President Clavsland'a
meanace might have been more gracious and
dignified if he could only have effaced frcjn' hie
recollectiou the unsuccessful election conp
which sullied an otherwise honorable record. We
did cot expect to find him repeating his original
error to show that he was not ashamed
of himself." After Quoting references to the
Sackvillo matter in the message, the Standard
proceeds in a similar strain and rnns through
sentence after sentence of solemn froth.
"Englishmen," it says, "can afford to
smile at such puerile nonsense, and
even Americans will not pretend to take
it in good earnest Doubtless Lord
Sackville wa3 technically wrong, but Ministers
Lowell and Phelps committed themselves in the
same way, though not in the same decree,
scores of times m their addresses to English
men, which we read with much edification, and
not the smallest trace of resentment"
GONE TO A HIGHER COURT.
Chamberlain, the Murderer, Abruptly Ends
ilis Trial by Uanjrins Himself in Jail.
freci&l to the IndlaraDolIs Journal.
Logansport, Ind., Dec. 3. Chamberlain has
hung himsslf. Such was the report thst start
led the city at an early hour this morning. It
took only a walk to the county jail to verify the
statement The jealous man who had murdered
Miss Ida Wittenberg had at last carried out
the dreadful threat of self-destruction made on
the night of his crime. His first idea expressed
at that time was to blow his brains out with a
revolver. It is likely that this plan was dropped
for lack of the necessary deadly instrument.
Chamberlain was first discovered dead, hanging
to his cell door in jail, at G:30 this morning, John
Cunningham, a prisoner, making the discovery
and giving the alarm. When the cell door
was unlocked and opened the murderer
was found hanging by a piece of bed-ticking,
with life extinct. Coroner Ballard was sum
moned to cut the man down. He found slight
indications of warmth, and attempted by pres
sure ts start the breathing, but life was too far
gone. Had he got there sooner he believes that
he could have resuscitated him. The prisoner
was dressed in his ordinary clothes, but his
shoes were off. Nothing was found in his
pockets, except a small piece of broom wire.
The hanging had been accomplished by means
of a strip of ticking he bad torn from the mat
tress in his cell. It was six inches wide and
three or four feet long, lie had tied it to tho
cross pieces, a little below the top of the cell
door, then placod his head in the noose and
swung off. His feet touched the floor but he
held tbein off. Even then his knees partly
rested below, but his nerve was 'equal
to the fearful ordeal, and he
swung on and gradually choked to
death. His face and neck showed that his death
was not quick nor violent, as is usual in bang
ing. His neck was not broken or lacerated.
His face looked as natural as during life.
Chamberlain was on trial for the murder of
Ida Wittenberg, at Reynolds. April 17, 1S37.
The jury was impaneled last Wednesday, since
which time they have been under the charge of
two bailiffs, cot being allowed to speak to any
one, but since their unexpected discharge
they have expressed themselves as being
almost of the unanimous opinion that
the death penalty would have ben fixed
had be not taken his own life. The first
intimation that bis mother had of his death was
while ascending the stone steps to the court
room, this morning, and the shock can be easier
imagined than described. The most affecting
scene witnessed during the trial was the parting
between Ed Chamberlain and his ared mother.
The young man turned pale and exhibited prief
of the most serious nature when his best friend
on earth placed her arms around his neck,
smoothed back his hair and kissed him with
that love and affection that only a mother can
feel for a eon. It was a scene that
touehed the hearts of all the spec
tators. Throuehout the entire trial
Mrs. Chamberlain sat rear her boy, with ber
face buried in her hand. Her feeble appear
ance and bent form aroused more sympathy in
her behalf than was manifested in the future
welfare of the young murderer. Chamberlain
did not fully realize the scantiness of bis
ch&nces to escape the gallows until his trial
came up. In the court-room he sate mute
spectator to the proceedings, and saw his own
life in the balance. Then he knew when justiee
was meted out to him be would bo snatched
from life by tho relentless hemp. His crime
was one of the most cold-blooded that ever
darkened the fair name of the State, and the
commonity breathes easier that the awful affair
is ended.

UALFOUR'S IRISH TOLICY.
Mr. Ellis Attacks the Secretary, stml Mr.
Gladstone Takes Fart In the Debate.
London, Dec. 3. The House of Commons
went into committee to-night on the Irish esti
mates. An appropriation of 12,707 was asked.
in order to complete the sum of 40.707 for ex
penses of the Irish Secretary's office. 2dr. John
K. Ellis, Liberal, moved that the amount asked
be reduced by 423, his purpose being to raise
a general debate on Mr. Balfour's administra
tion. He cbarzed that the government was
using coercion to such an extent that 1,500 per
sons had been imprisoned since the crimes act
went into operation. Mr. Balfour, he eaid, was
seeking to concesl from the people of England
tbe acts of cruelty perpetrated in Ireland. He
had adopted a system of evasion and of inac
curacy of statement - within and without
Parliament. The inaccuracy might arise
from ignorance, for Mr. Balfour was
generally absent from his post at
Dublin. In this be was unlike any of his pre
decessors. Seldom or never had the chief Sec
retary for Ireland left his duties to subordinates.
Mr. Balfour's entire administration had been
characterized by petty malignity and calculated
brntality.
Mr. Balfour replied that Mr. Ellis had come to
a dark conclusion regarding his Balfour's moral
character. Ho had accused the Irish Secretary
of evasion and inaccuracy, and of malignity and
brutality In his conduct
Mr. Ellis interposed with a correction, "What
I said waa that your administration is charac
terized by those qualities."
Mr. Balfour rejoined: "That does not make
much difference. My statements retarding tbe
situation in Ireland have invariably been based
upon official reports, these being largely statis
tics that could not teasonably be impugned.
Men like Mr. Ellis go about England talk
ing of 3,000 and other fictitious numbers
of eviction notices which had been served upon
tenants, thereby turnine them out of doors and
depriving them of tho right of a free sale and a
just compensation for their improvements. He
asserted also that I had suppressed or wantonly
prosecuted the newspapers, and that 1 had im
prisoued little boys for selling these journals,
with other similar nonsense. The government
most earnestly desires to enable the people to
know the whole truth about Ireland. If tbe
country once understood the criminal methods
by which political objects were advocated in
Ireland, if tbe cbaracter of tbe alliance binding
thi opposition were revealed, the verdict would
not be with Mr. Gladstone.
Mr. Gladstone who had come up from Ha
wardsn in order to assist in the attack upon the
government twitted Mr. Balfour and other
Conservatives with having sought a similar
alliance on the eve of the last election. The
ex-l'remlor denied that the Liberals sought a
party advantage in an alliance which arose from
a concurrence of opinion with the Nationalists
upon the great lines of their policy toward Ire
land. Mr. Balfour made him an object of com
ment in a style that was without parallel. He
did not personally resist Mr. Balfoar's Invective,
and would endeavor to keep at the remotest
distance possible from competing with such
language. He proceeded to charge Mr. Balfour
with misrepresenting Earl Spencers treatment
of prisoners when Earl Spencer was Vice
roy ol Ireland. He declared that Mr. Balfour,
when shown his error, ought to have apologized
to Carl Spencer. Referring to tbe case of Kin
sella, Mr. Gladstone quoted from a pamphlet
written by a priest named Dillon, entitled,
"Tbe Murder of Kinsella," as forcing upon ev
ery man of candor and of humane feelings the
s troop conviction that to thoee who admin
istered the law in Ireland tho life of a National
ist was not ot the same value as that of a loyal
ist. Coming to the murders at Mitchelstown,
be assured the Conservatives that nothing but
repentance would silence tbe reproach arising
from that mistake. It would be heard again
and again until the government would be
obliged to condemn what it had heretofore
praised, or until the time came when the solemn
verdict or tne whole country was
given. Tbe wanton slaughter of
innocent men remained unpunished. The
murders were never even inquired into as they
ought to have been. But what could he expect
ed of an administration usine as its instrument
resident magistrates who were totally incompe
tent fur performing their duties, or sometimes
convicting upon tbe loosest evidence? .How
could such an administration claim the charac
ter of honorable, or pure, or just? How eould a
government defending it call itself the champion
of law and order!
Mr. Balfour said that Mr. Gladstone, while
protesting against the use of strong language.
indulged in criticisms tbe chief feature of which
was strength of epithet. He Mr. Balfour! ad
mitted that he had fallen into an error regarding
Earl Spencer s treatment of a member for Dublin
Harbor, but this i mistake .arose from defective
information supplied him. Regarding the case
of Kinsella, how was the government to blame?
The man who was supposed to have shot Kin
sella was arrested, but the grand jury failed to
indict him and the judge declared that there
was no evidence upon which to hold him. Mr.
Gladstone had refrained from repeating the old
story about Mr. Mandeville being tortured to
death in prison, and he had done so because the
facts in tbe case proved that Mr. Mandeville a
imprisonment bad nothing to do with his death.
Similarly, Mr. Gladstone, in his account of
the events at Mitohellatown, omitted to re
fer to the mob's.attack upon the police, thereby
distorting the troth about the affair. In con
cluding. Mr. Balfour asked whether there could
be better proof that the law was well and prop
erly administered in Irelend than tho evidence
affordod by tbe fact tbat the opposition was
compelled to rely upon three or four cases, in
stanced time after time as grievances. The
assailants of the government could not travel
bevond the narrow limits of a few charge..
which had often been refuted. They still relied
upon statements which were rehashed and
served anew, but of which tbe country must be
heartily tired.
After short speeches by Mr. Dillon, Sir G. O.
Trevelvan and Mr. Balfour with reference to the
G'adstonian government's treatment of political
prisoners, the debate, on motion of Mr. OBrien,
was adjourned.
ATROCITIES IN PERU.
Itrntal Murders, Followed by Mutilation
140 Teople Killed.

TI1R KNGL1SH IN AFRICA.
Relief that the British Cabinet Contemplates
Another Soudan Campaign.
London. Dec. 3. There is a rapidly growing
belief that the movement in favor of lending
the aid of British troops to the Egyptian garri
son at Suakim will lead to the inauguration of
a fresh Soudan campaign, which will include the
recapture of Khartoum, if it does net even go
further. It is proposed that troops be sent to
Suakim to assist tho Egyptians in driving the
rebels back into the interior, but nobody fav
oring the project ha yet been found who will
say, even approximatslr, how far inland tbe
Arab hordes investing the Red sea fort
and harrassiog its inhabitants should be
drusu. The ostentible object will
undoubtedly receive the approval ot a majority
of the people of England, but that its develop
ment into cnother boudaoea uasco, involving
useless expenditure of lifo and money on the
part or England and tne iurtner impovensn
ment of Egypt, will be popularly applauded, is
extremely questionable. Concerning tho rnoTe-
ment the St. Jame? Gszette declares tbat tho
smashing of tbe Mahdi at Khartoum is the
only way in which to obtain and maintain ulti
mate quiet and relieve Egypt l rota the ever-
present danger of being overwhelmed by an in
rush of barbarians. Of course, the movement
meets with general approval in the military
circles, because of tbe opportunities of promo
tion which a protracted campaign would afford.
