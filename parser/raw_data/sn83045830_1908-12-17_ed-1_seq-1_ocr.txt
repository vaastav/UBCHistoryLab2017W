REPLIESTO PRESIDENT
Paper was Went oned n Special Mes?

Are Persistent.
(By Associated Press.)
INDIANAPOLIS, IND.. Dec.lG?Tile
Indianapolis News, mentioned in the
special message on the Panama canal
deal, sent to Congress yesterday by
President Roosevelt, to-lay issued >
reply to the chief executive.
It says, in part:
"It is difficult to characterize fully
the latest outbreak of the Presiden' j
without resorting : . t!>e use of Ian- j
guage as undignifled and blameworthy
as that which ie.it the President's ut?
terance in u class by itself in the of?
ficial literature of the high office he
holds.
Chagrin to Country.
"Whatever provocation Mr. Roose?
velt may have felt pricking his soul,
nothing could justify, or much extentu
ate tin- torren- f invective and v.ru
lence which lie :>oured cut in a state
?paiRT upon the h< ads of ;>: ivate citi?
zens. No one in h:;; rober sense.; ?
can fail to regard the performance rs
a grave derogation to the dignity of
the presidential station, a pitiable ex
Jtttl.ition of lowering rage upon the
l?r: tf the chief magistrate, and
chagrin io the entire country. It la
qrite impcj&ible, to think o.' any ?'
Mr Roosevelt's long line of distin?
guish* d prelecessors 'hat co-Id pos?
sibly have so forgotten the dignities
atic; decencies of his exalted position
a.* t? transmit to Congress a tneaaagi
in anyway comparable with that r?l
yesterday ."

Two Party Leaders Active.
It wa- decided that Setia'or Aldrlcii
should Maud spons r for the measure
and today the Khode Island senator
,res,me.I a resolution authorizing the
inquiry.
Senator Culberson, the caucus lea
?Ii r of the Democrats, sent up a -??b
stltu e which was even more tperl
fir- than V.r. Aldrlch's resolution.
Moth measures were promptly refer?
red t . th-- committee on contingent]
expenses, and almost Immediately <
afterwards Senator Kenn, from that
com mit tee re|K>rted back the Aldrlcii
resolution with a recommendation
that it pass.
Senator Culberson objected and it
looked as if consideration would Ix ]
postponed until tomorrow.
Democrats Waive Contention. I
Some of the leaders of the two Side;
of tiie chamber found an opportunity

as to the course of action it shoul !
take- with reference to the portion of|
the message which has Ix-a-n consider?
ed objectionable could be incorpora?
ted in If.
I After a very animated discussion,
in which several members of the Sen?
ate spoke very pointedly regarding
'the pra'sident's utterances, the resolu?
tion was adopted.
Baily War ts Strong Language.
j Mr. Baily objected to the resctation
ibecause it .lid not direct the commit?
tee to inquire into the "very gros.,
and wanton" words of the President ?
I message.
I "So |ar as I am concerned." he said.
?'mi act km should be taken on that
I resolution until that point la rtwered.
j Kit her Congress is the most Infamous
tiody that ever assembled In any eonn

inotice of this most watiton and Rron.

? Mr AMrlch insisted thi? the res .lo?
tion provided for jus' what Mr. Ha!
ley advocated, but the x-na'or from
Tixas retorted tha" if that was
included in the resolution |t was in

CARACAS. VENEZUELA, Dec. 14.
Monday, via Willemstad, Curacao.
Dec, Mi Thi prnpln of Carst rgg arose
today against president Castro. An In?
furiate,! mob. unhindered by the po?
lice swept through the. city, wreck?
ing the roperty cf his henchmen and
clown friends.
The people rounded up all the
statues and pictures of President Cas-'
tro from the clubs and other semi
public bnil.ling:? and burned them with
rej Icing on the Plaza Bolivar.
Castro's rule in Venezuela proba?
bly Is ended. in spite of Holland's
warlike activity on the coast, 'here
have been no demonstrations against
the Netherlands; they all have been
directed against president Castro and
Acting President Oomes.
Put'her ?la.ig? rous (irm</)i?trations
are anticipated.
No Deocsing Act.
No official act deposing Castro from
the presidency of Venezuela yet
been taken, but such a step 1s exj
ed any moment. An enormous er
of the Inhabitants of the capital, si
ed by people from the outlying;
try, got bored in the streets soon after
daybreak.
The people began marching up
down the main thoroughfares sad It
was easy to see that their ill-temper
would soon result In violence. The
police stood by and made no attempt
whatever to restrain the mob. TfcO
flrrt building to be attacked and loot?
ed was that of the lottery monopoly.
The officers of the State enterprise
that has enriched Itself at the eg
pense of the people were ransacked
and pillaged. Furniture was broken
and thrown into the streets and thous
ands of lottery- tickets were destroyed.
Castro's Organ Pillaged.
The crowd then moved to the print?
ing office of El Conatltucional. the or?
gan of President Castro, of WhJsfe
C.umersindo Rivas is editor, and put
laged it completely. A steam Uac
dry belonging to Senor Rivas also
was wrecked.
The crowd then turned its attention
to several drug stores belonging to
Senor Thielen, a son-in-law of General
Telo Mendoza. and turned them InslJ?
out.
frcneral Mendoza was at one tl
mini-ter or finance and public credit
under Castro. He was also the Presi?
dent's private secretary for several
years, and has been regarded as
of his staunchest supporters.
He is universally hated by the <
mies of Castro, and his unpopularity
and his close connection wl'h H
president accounted for the anaer <
the populace against the property *?
bis sop to law.
Statues and Pictures Burned.
The statues and pictures of
dent Castro were made into a
bo.idfirc on the Plaza Bolivar.
The crowd cheered as the
completed the destruction of these ef?
figies of the dictator.
Numerous inscriptions setting fort?
