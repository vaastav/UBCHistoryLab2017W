THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
ThB people of these United tftates who
are id accord with Republican principals
will read with pleasure, pride, and profit
tho Message of Gcnerl Grant, which will be
found elsewhere iu ouf columns. Those
who are Dot in such accord will Hud iu it
ruuoh matter suggestive 6f thought, and
uoae to give offence. A state paper it
ranks among the ablest 6f productions.
There is Done of that dti'gtDa'ffeui that in An
drew Joh'Dson's papers" results Congress
and the people, uor fs there any of that
indifference to established faets which threw
Johnson so fat back 6'f the moving, think,
ing prescot. It comports as nearly h may
bo with the popular idea of a Message.
Wherein it refers to completed lines of pol
icy the reasons aro n6vcr withhold, and
wherein these Hoes art' foreshadowed, it is
done in that suggest! iS style which invites
the oo-operatiou of Congress and insures its
confidence. In its scope the Messaged
not more general than others ; ia its grasp
of issues it will stand as a model. Its one
great characteristic is the hearty endorse,
rjent it gives to those principals which car
ried the war to a successful termination,
and that now would not allow any of its
lessons to escape. Tho initial period of the
Administration is over. It has had time to
cast its horoscope. Regarding the Message
as the embodiment of administrative tiiouht
and predilection, it is so pre-eminently Re
publican as to doubly vindicate the wisdom
f selecting its author as Chief Executive
of tho nation.
The Message opens with a glowing sketch
of the National coudition. lilessod with
pcQco, all are left free to study the vast re
sources and contemplate the features that
make this people to prosperous, uuitcd,
and happy. Our areas are ample for five
hundred million souls. Tho land abounds
in mineral and agricultural wealth. Here
tho most benign institutions, whether ol
learning, religion, philanthropy, law or lib
erty, have their raise nud enjoy a patronage
unequalcd among civilized nations. One
speech, and that thu English, is common
- to forty million inhabitants, and is a per.'
petual bond of unity and homogeueily
the very touchstone of republican institu
tions. The work of Congress iu restoring the
long-lost Sta'.es, and protecting and foster
ing free labor and freedom, is approved.
While all the results may not bo juite sat
isficfactory, yctepough success hss becu
achie'ed to prove beyond doubt tho justice
of the procedure, and to show that different
counsels would have been attended with
disaatrous delays, or would have jeopard
ised the sword wrought logic of the rebel
lion.
There is no miucing of words respecting
the Southern situation. Take tho cato ol
Georgia as an illustration. A constitution
was adopted ; members of the Legislature
were elected. A part of thnt Legislature
expelled another part, in contravention ul
tho State constitution they had just adopted,
and iu violation of the fourteenth amend
mcnt to the Federal Constitution. O'.her
members were substituted who were ineli
gible, according to the same high author
ities. The Supreme court of Georgia has,
besides, decided that the expelled mem
bers were eligible and that tho substituted
ones were not. This is the case, simply,
tersely stated. The remedy suggested is
the enactment of a general law requireing
an obedience to the State and Federal com
pacts. There is no talk of expedients here ;
no shuffling, temporising suggestions. The
caso is understood and is squarely met.
The law in the hands of Grant will be am
pie.
The rresidettt looks upon the work ac
complished in Virginia with an eye of sat-
faction. Perhaps ho is a little too compla
cent here. True, the letter of the law may
have been fulfilled, but its spirit has been
violated. However, the consefjueuses be
upon the State. The Executive could not
fathom intentions, and the autorities ean
only deal with acts, '
Turning to the fiuances, the President
avows the desirability of an uuvarying me
dium of circulation. The present currency
he regards as a uccessary evil growing
out of the war, but he d es not in
sult the Congress with its presence, as did
his predescssor, neither does he, like him,
iurent an ingenious plan for repudiating
tho debt. Early resumption is advised, yet
by early resumption is meant such a re
sumption as will bo fair to the debtor clas.
aos. The ruin that would follow a hasty
leap from a currency to a gold circulation
is fully set forth. Among the infinitude of
plana proposed by which to transfoiui tho
money medium, the Presdent sees but one
that is conceived to be available. Let
the Treasury redeem its paper at a fixed
price whenever preseuted, and let it with,
hold all currency so redeemed until fold
gun for gold. Approval is given to the
scheme of funding the debt at a lower rate
of interest, and the making of our bonds
payable at one or moro of tho European
money centres. The President has full
faith in tbe financial ttrength of the natron,
and regards the extinguishment of tho debt
as a matter easy of accomplishment at an
early day.
His position on the tnriffhns been already
anticipated by the action of tho Ways and
Means Committee ol the House. Tbe re
quirements of the Government are annually
diminishing, thanks to Republican re
trenchment and reform, and if a funding
bill should pans a great saving iu interest
would be effected. These things consider
ed, wherein the tariff is solely for revenue
its modification is advised. The principle
of protection is left intact, and, we take it,
has tho e ndorsesient of the President.
Touching CuVan affairs, the Presideut
adheres to the line of absolute right as
laid down by the law of nations and recog
nized by local enactments. Tho direction
and eitet,t of sympathy iu this country is
well understood, aud ife individual wishes
Were law there could be no difficulty about
recognizing Cuban beligctetey. Rut un
happily there are constraining influences,
which, to disregard, might precipitate war,
a thing to be deprecated1 by every citizen.
To this position the charge of uatioual
cowardice is lo answer. It is nothing but
an undignified taunt, a virtual confession of
a weak oause. The President is not afraid
of his position'. All tho past is an echo of
tbe fact that the Government of the United
States has dared to do right, come what
would.
After glancing at tho dcbartmcntal re
ports, the President lays down the broad
platform which he adopted as the guide to
his administration. It is the gist of his mes.
sage, aud mora than that, it is the refinement
of advanced Republicanism. There is not
a patriot in the laud but who will subscribe
to the' brief political creed he enunciates,
aud, if more were needed to establish its
rightfulness, it may bo found is tho fact
we anticipate, that there is not a Demccratic
partitau in the laud who will uot denounce
it.
At the instance of tire Executive, nego
tiations concerning the Alabama claims
were purposely discontinued until the ex
citement in both Countries over the rejec
tion of the treaty by the American Senate
was alloyed. There is, however, no pur
pose evinced to abandon them. On the
contrary, the defects of the treaty are clearly
pointed out, aud the character of the issues
which must meet settlement is fully desig
nated. A reciprocity treaty between 'be
United States aud Canada is looked upon
as a species oi unwarrantable favoritrsai to
ward the peoplo of the Domiuion, aud as
such a discrimination against the citizens
of this country. The Indian policy is looked
upou as an experiment which promises
well.
We cannot better concludo this review
than by givir.g it :
I'itst. A strict integrity in fulfilling all
our obligations.
Second. To secure protection to the per
son and property of the citizen ot tho
Uuitcd States in caoh and every portion of
our common country, wheiever be may
choose to move, without reference lo orig
inal nationality, religion, co'or, or politics,
demanding of him only obedience to the
iaws and proper respect for the rights of
others.
Third. Uuion of all the States, with
equal rights iudestructible by any consti.
tutional menus Phila. Prett.
Don't bk Extiiavaoant. If the poor
house has any terrors lor you, never buy
what jou don't need,
jjefore you pay three cents for a jew's harp,
my boy, ascertain .whether you can't make
just as unpleasant a noi.-e by whistlig, for
which nature fumUhes the machinery.
And before you pay $75 for a coat, young
man, find out whether your lady-love would
not be just as glad to see you iu one that
would cost half the money. If she would
not, let her crack her own hazel-nuts and
buy her owu clothes.
ben you see a man spending two or
three dollars a week fooliahly, the chances
aro five to one he'll livo long enough to
know how mauy ceuts there are in a dollar,
oud if he don't, he's pretty sure to bequeath
that privilege to his widow.
When a man asks you to buy that for
which you have no use, no mattei how cheap
t is, don't say yes until you aro sure some
one elee wants it in aurauce.
Money burns iu eonin folks' pockets, and
makes such a big hole that everything that
is put in drops through, past finding.
The returns from Mississippi indicate the
election ol Gen. Alcorn, the Republican
candidate lor Governor, by a large majority
with a Legislature to match; aud the few
returns from Texas give assurance of iho
triumph of Gen A. J. Hamilton by a deci
sive majority. These are the results which
have boeu for soma time enticipatcd by in
tellitient politicians. We do not doubt
thit they may be accepted as securing the
ratification ol tiioXVth Auicudweut ly
' those Suits.

which has been uuder construction for sev
eral years ia now nearly completed. It is
the largest in the United States. The
buildings are beautifully constructed with
good finish and handily arranged. The
vats number over eight hundred and some
of them are very large. They are now fin.
itdiing, and shiping, about forty tuns of
sole-leather per week. Tho dry house and
rolling mills are iu a sepcrato department.
We do not knov what the size of this
spacious building is, but is easily seen from
the P. & E. R. R., to be seven stories high.
All its inside machinery works as perfect
and oasy as a clock. Mr. Schulta was the
designer of this great establishment but Mr.
Allen, the boss mechanic, has gained a
high reputation by his ingenuity and skill
in the cousttuction of those mammoth buil
dings. The dwelling houses for the em
ployees of this taDncry number about one
hundred, besides the shanties that are scat,
tered through the dense forest where they
peel the bark from the timber of hundreds
of acres yearly to supply the tannciy. The
Tanning Company Storo is the largest in
this couutry and its extensive variety of
goods is, probably not excelled in the state.

Dressing tour Wife. You wish to
dress your wife better thau your circumstan
ces will allow. She wauts to have you. She-
is a woman of spirit, it is said, aud docs not
mean to be a drudge. "Why should ewur
neighbors," she says to her husband, "dress
any better than wo? They are made of the
same flesh and blood that we are. Sec
how they come out. I don't think any
man of spirit would let his wife and chil
li en go to church dressed as you let us go.
Look at these children. You would think
they had just come out of sorrfe slop house.
If I had married as I might have married,
we should have had different times I and
my childicn now many men are stung
to the quick by such remarks from their
wifes. Often times their moral sense re
volts, at Erst, and they feel indignation; but
,:contiuual dropping wears a stone," and
by-and by the man is dressed a little better
than he can afford ; and somebody must pay
lor tho extravagance. I do not mean thai '
they are tempted to steal j but! do say i'nar
they grind. They moan somehow to got it
ont of the milliner, out of the dress maker,
or out of the merchaot. They intend to
make one hand wash the other somehow
aud they, go into petty meanness to bring it
about. And this desire to dress better thau
they can afford is taking off tho very enamel
of their virtue, and taking out the very
stamina ot their relijrioui life. Unimpor
tant as it seems, ostentatious vanity in dress
has ruined many a family, aud darned,
many a soul. Rev. Henry Ward livelier.
A HOLD OUTRAGE A gentleman from
Phceuixvillo called at the Central Station,
one day last week, aud gave Chief Kelley
iuformation of oue of the boldest burglaries
that have ever occurred in that place It
seems that between 3 and 4 o'clock on the
morning of Deo. 1, two men, who were mask,
cd, entered a house iu Phoenixville, oocu-
pieU by Hannah and Mary C. Kernao, and
proceeded to tho bed.hambcr where the
ladies were sleeping. The scoundrels theu
demanded of them their money. Hannah
replied that she bad none; but the demand
being repeated, sho fiually gave them $35.
stating that was all thev had.
The men then asked for the keys of cer
tain drawers, which at first were refused,
but being threatened, and fearing that the
rascals would carry their threats into ex
ecution, the keys were hauded to them.
Every drawer was then opened, and from
them they secured $l,GOft in city sixes,
1 , 500 in United States bonds, a gold
watch, and several articles of wearing ap
parcl. Alter the burglars had obtained
all they desired they took the cord from one
of tbe beds and tied the females, and on
leaving bade them good night,
