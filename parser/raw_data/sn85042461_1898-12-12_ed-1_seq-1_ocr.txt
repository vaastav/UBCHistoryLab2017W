TWENTY-SIXTH YEAR. NO. 73.
THE NICARAGUA CANAL BILL
Will Be Called up in the Senate
at Today's Session
MORGAN HOPES ID SECURE ACTION
Opponents of the Measure Will seek to Delay Consideration
Until After the Holidays—The House Will
Consider Appropriation Bills
Associated Press Special Wire.
WASHINGTON, Dec U.—The course o
proceedings in tlie senate this week wii
depend upon the disposition that is made
of the Nicaragua canal bill. It is Senatoi
Morgan's intention to call up this measun
Monday, and he has expressed tin hop<
that he will secure action at the Mondaj
session. Few of his most sanguine co
workers agree with liim in this opinion, and
the best indication is that unless an agree
ment can lie reached for postponement, sev
eial days at least will be consumed in its
consideration. The opponents of the meas
ure will meet its supporters with a proposi
tion to defer consideration until after the
Christmas holidays, and they will give as
their reason for this request the fact that
the report of the government commissioi
appointed to investigate the feasibility di
the canal has not yet been made, urging
the importance of receiving the information
which the commission will be able lo fur
nish before acting upon so important a
question. If the bill is taken up in earnest
It will consume the greater portion of the
senate's lime until finally disposed of. An
other subject on the calendar is toe anti
scalping bill, which Senator Cullom has in
formed Ihe senate he will seek to get up at
an early day. but he will meet with oppo
sition if he makes the i fl'ort, aud is not likely
to succeed thu- early in the sesion.
The special order for Monday at 2 o'clock
is the bill providing for ihe registry of for
eign built -hips, but if (he Nicaragua canal
bill should be taken up the registry bill
would not be allowed to consume much t inn.
Senator Morrill has given notice of a mo
tion Tuesday to consider the bill providing
for the purchase id' a site for the United
Slates supreme court, but the proceedings
with reference to this measure will be con
fined to a speech by the Vermont senator.
The urgent army deficiency bill will re
ceive attention early iv tlte week. The
committee on appropriation*will meet Mon
day, nnd il is not believed more than one
meeting on the) bill will be necessary'- Sen
ator Allison, chairman of the committee,
hopes, therefore, to get the ! ill before the
senate for consideration Tuesday.
It has been prophesied that the army bill
Would be used as a pretext for discussion
of the Spanish war. and the fear of such a
course has not entirely subsided.
IN THE HOUSE
Appropriation Bills to Be Given the
Rifrht of Way
WASHINGTON, Ore. 11.-Beyond the
first three days there is nn program mapped
out for the house this week. Tomorrow
will lie devoted, under the rules, to the con
sideration of business relating tn the Dis
trict of Columbia, and on Tuesday the Dis
trict of Columbia appropriation bill will be
taken up. This is in pursuance of tire de
termination of the leaders to give the ap
propriation bills the right of way whenever
one is ready. There is nnthinc in tha dis
trict bill this year to attract opposition, and
unless the unexpected happens the bill ought
to pass Tuesday or Wednesday al the latest.
The appropriations sub.committee on pen
sions will commence work on the pensions
appropriation bill tomorrow, but it can hard
ly he ready before next week. It is con
fidently expected, however, that the bill will
be passed before the holidays. It is prob
able that Chairman Hull of the military
affairs committee will be able tn bring in
the army reorganization bill as soon as the
district appropriation bill is OUI of the way.
He is exceedingly anxious tn get the hill inio
the house at the earliest possible moment,
as he is particularly solicitous that it should
pass the house before the holidays. If it
shmild follow the district bill a very inter
esting debate would be precipitated, 'i he
future policy of the government is ordained
in the bill for the increase of the standing
army, nnd the whole subject will be opened
up. The Democrats are divided upon the
question of increasing the regular army, but
how far the nppnsition will go in antagoniz
ing the measure il is impossible to forecast.
Only last week, during the debate on the
urgency deficiency bill. Mr. De Armond of
Missouri, one of Ihe leaders, evaded a direct
reply when the question was put fairly tn
him by Mr. Cannon, chairman nf the appro
priations committee. If the army reorgan
ization bill does not come up, the various
committees under the call will probably be
allowed tn clean up business which they have
on the calendar.

THE HERALD
COMMISSIONERS REST
| AFTER THE LONG STRAIN OF
TREATY-MAKING
TREATY TEXT NOT PUBLISHED
But Some Details Are Made Public.
The Pope Announces an Anti-
Carlist Policy
PARIS, Dec. 11.—The United States
peace commissioners rested today after the
long strain of daily conferences and almost
daily sessions with the Spaniards, the in
tensity ot which they hardly realized until
it was over. Warm personal friendships and
mutual regard have arisen between the two
commissions as the result of their extended
controversy at close quarters.
Today several members of both commis
sions exchanged calls. The American com
missioners! unofficially informed the Span
iards they would be glad to have the two
commissions dine together. The reply,
which, like the invitation, was conveyed
diplomatically through a third party, was
that the Spaniards would be most pleased,
but feared it would be inadvisable because
it might be misconstrued at Madrid, where
already much feeling existed against the
Spanish commissioners.
Several members of the United States
commission were inclined at tirst to publish
the text of the treaty, but Senator Frye
made a strong plea yesterday for the observ
ance of courtesy toward the United States
senate, and his arguments prevailed.
Furl her details, however, have been
learned as to ihe wording of the treaty,
which provides that Cuba is to be relin
quished and that Porto Rico and the Phil
ippines are to be ceded. The Americans are
to pay for the repatriation of the Spanish
troops from all the colonies. The Spaniards
are to return all prisoners of war held by
them. They are to retain possession of all
military stores and munitions of war in the
Philippines and of such ship." as have not
been captured.
The commercial treaties between the two
nations which the war ruptured are to be
renewed at rhe convenience of the two na
tions.
The United States commissioners have
be<u almost overwhelmed with offers of din
ners in England, prompted by the desire of
prominent Englishmen to emphasize the
Anglo-American entente, but they will re
main in Paris until the day before sailing
for the United States.
They will make formal calls upon Presi
dent Faure and high officials hcrtfto thank
them for official hospitalities'. Unofficial
hospitality to the United States commission
ers has been ostentatiously lacking in Paris.
The Spanish Protest
MADRID, Dec. 11.-—The RovernmentTn"
tirely approves the memorandum of protest
against the action of tlie United States com
missioners tiled by Senor Montero Rios at
Paris.
El Liberal says: "The Paris negotiations
offer a far sadder spectacle than the ships
which arc bringing back our repatriated sol
tliers, deplorable as the condition of the
latter is."
The cabinet, it is said, will meet the cor
tes intact; Senor Sagasla will ask an indem
nity bill for the cession of the Philippines.
The cabinet will then declare, as it finds
itself at a crisis, that it cannot admit any
debate anel will, therefore, demand the im
mediate adaption of the bill, after which
Senor Sagasta will submit the question of
confidence of the queen regent.
El Horaldo says the government believes
that, in the present circumstances, the hold
ers of the Philippines debt will accept the
arrangements arrived nt, and considers that
the Cuban bondholders should demand of
the future government of Cuba a fulfillment
of the contract by'claiming a mortgage on
the customs which guarantee the debt.
The memorandum protests against the
refusal of the Americans to surrender the

securities deposited in tlie treasuries of
Cuba ami Porto Rico by private Spaniards,
remarking that "never has a civilized na
tion committed such au act of violence."
Secondly, it protests against the ultima
tum demanding the Philippines.
Thirdly, it protests against the position
in which thoae Spaniards are placed who
desire to remain in Cuba.
Fourthly, it protests against the refer
ence to the destruction of the Maine in
President; McKinley's message to the
United States congress. On this point the
memorandum says:
"Spain has proposed arbitration, but the
United States refuses to give her the right
which is granted to a criminal, namely, the
right of defending herself. Tlie Spanish
commissioners leave tho care of fixing tlie
responsibility for the explosion to the en
tire world, which will say whether these
are responsible who desire the truth, or
those refusing to seek it."
Tlie newspapers generally express relief
at the signing of the treaty. The independ
ent organs, most of the provincial papers
and the Carlist and Republican .journals, at
tack both political parties, conservative and
liberal, reproaching them equally with hav
ing brought the country to the present
pass.
El Imparcial alone publishes the contents
of the treaty, which produces a less un
favorable impression than had been ex
pected owing to the commercial and other
concessions to Spain.
The Vatican Policy
ROME, Dee. 11—The pope has decided
that the Spanish policy of the Vatican shall
be anti-Carlist and not neutral.
MANILA, Dee. 11. —Acording to reliable
advices received from 11010, capital of the
island cf Pan ay in the Visayas group, the in
surgents attacked Iloilo on the night of De
cember Ist and captured all Ihe Spanish
trenches except one. They then notilied
General Rios to remove the women and chil
dren and threatened to renew the attack
the following night.
When these advices left Iloilo, General
Rios was expecting reinforcements and lield
guns and the plan was for the Spanish gun
boats to shell the town if the insurgents
effected an entrance. The foreign residents
were greatly alarmed and, all merchantmen
have been ordered outside the harbor in or
der to allow tlie gunboats to operate. Mean
while the Spanish authorities have been ad
vised that the Tulisanos troops are looting,
in disobedience to orders, and cannot be re
strained.
On the other hand, the Spanish transport
Isla de Luzon reports that the insurgents
around Iloilo were repulsed with great
.-laughter on December Bth while attempting
to storm the last entrenchment. Aeording
to this story 500 insurgents were killed or
wounded by the machine guns.
British Satisfaction
LONDON, Dec. 12.—The editorials in
the London morning papers express satis
faction at the signing of the peace treaty,
the negotiations for which the Daily News
remarks, have occupied rather a longer
time than tlie war.
Tlie Times, pretty accurately represent
ing the views of the other papers, says:
"Spain has lost her colonies because her
colonial system was founded upon spolia
tion and tyranny. The United States has
not treated her any more harshly than
Germany treated France in 1871, or Rus
sia treated Turkey in 1878. Therefore the
Spanish memorandum of protest is un
reasonable and unjustified."
The article then refers to the difficulties
facing the United States, and expresses
confidence that the "healthy vigor and
practical capacity of the Anglo-Saxon" will
be fully competent to deal with them.
BARCELONA, Dee. 11.—A large quan
tity of brick work in a sewer in course of
construction here collapsed this afternoon,
burying many of the workmen. Eighteen
bodies have been recovered.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 11.—The rifle
record on the Columbia target was broken

Pnpe, his score being 35 in ten shots, a 3%
inch average.

CANADIAN QUESTIONS
BY NO MEANS IN THE FAIR WAY
OF A SETTLEMENT
RECIPROCITY WILL NOT WORK
The Joint High Commissioners Decide
on an Early Adjournment to
Last Till March
Associated Press Special Wire
ST. JOHNS, X. F., Dec. 11.—It is re
ported iv official circles here that the Anglo-
American joint high commission having
under consideration the- questions in dis
pute between Canada and the United States
will adjourn on Thursday next, to resume
its sitilings next March after the expiration
of the present congress, when a special ses
sion of the United States congress, then
under Republican control, will be calledito
ratify a treaty submitted by the joint high
commission.
Prospects Not Bright
WASHINGTON, Dee. 11.—It has been
agreed by the high joint commissions of
Americans and Canadians, which has been
in session here several weeks, to adjournat
an early date. This fact has not been for
mally announced, but it is understood that
the day fixed for adjournment is December
20. On the evening of December 19 the
Canadians will give a banquet, to which
tlie Americans will be invited.
The understanding is that the sessions
will not be returned until .liter March 4th
next, when the American commission, who
are members of the house and senate, will
have leisure to devote to the negotiations.
Whether the sessions will be resumed at
Quebec, where they were begun, or in this
city, has not been stated.
The decision to adjourn has grown out of
the developments of the past week. While
there are several protocols in the proposed
treaty, notably the Bering sea, the North
Atlantic fisheries, reciprocity and questions
affecting the great lakes, reciprocity is the
one great subject in which the Canadians
are intere.-ted. Last week the high com
missioners came nearer than they have ever
been before to the discussion of that sub
ject. The Canadians bad submitted propo
sitions, and on Wednesday the Americans
submitted counter proposals. These coun
ter proposals showed that the Americans
were disposed to be very unyielding, and
that much smaller concessions would really
be made than, had been expected. The ne
gotiations of last week also convinced the
Canadians that free lumber, a consumma
tion they and all their people have devoutly
wished for, was impossible. The American
commissioners not only told the Canadians
so. but the latter were invited to the capitol,
and while there met several prominent
members of the house and senate, who im
pressed the fact still more firmly upon them.
It. is said that the Americans haveagreed to
a small reduction of the duty on live ani
mals, and have intimated that they may
agree to a small reduction in the duty on
lumber, now !?2 per thousand. The Can
adians had hoped for much larger conces
sions.
This condition of things and the apparent
impossibility of reaching an agreement, be
fore Christmas are saidi to have led to the
decision for an adjournment. The senate
may be called in session after March 4th to
transact business, when there would, be
ample time to present any treaty that may
have been framed with Canada. At pres
ent the outlook for an agreement is not
bright.
The Brandes Case
SANTA CRUZ, Dec. 11.—The county
clerk' records show that Alfred Brandos, ac
cused of murdering his step-daughter at
Berkeley, and Mary Arellanes procured a
marriage license here in 1884. He was 19
and she was 15 years old, but it appears that
the consent of neither parent nor guardian
was obtained.
GENERAL CALIXTO GARCIA
Has Fought His Last Battle for
Cuban Freedom
THIRTY YEARS OE BITTER STRUGGLE
Found Him Ever Ready to Suffer for the Cause, Whether in
the Forefront of Battle or Lying in
Spanish Prisons
Associated Press Special Wire
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11—General Ca
lixto Garcia, the distinguished Cuban war
rior and leader, and the head of the com
mission elected by the Cuban assembly to
visit this country, died here this morning
shortly after 10 o'clock at the Hotel Ra
leigh, where the commission has its head
quarters. The sudden change from tne
warm climate of Cuba, with the hardships
he liafl there endured, to the wintry weath
er of New York and Washington, is respon
sible for the pneumonia Which resulted in
his demise. He contracted a slight cold in
New York, which did not assume an alarm
ing stage until the early part of last week.
On Tuesday night General Garcia, in com
pany with the other members of the com
mission, attended a dinner given in his
honor by General Miles, and it was a result
of exposure there that culminated in his
death.
During the twelve hours or more pre
ceding dissolution, General Garcia was un
conscious most of the time.
DEATHBED SCENES.
At intervals lie recognized one or more
of those about him. In his dying moments,
as all through his busy and active life, his
thoughts were for his beloved country aud
iTs people, and among his last words were
irrational mutterings, in which he gave or
ders to his son, who is on his staff, for the
battle which he supposed was to occur to
morrow, and in which he understood there
were only -100 Spaniards to combat. Just
before he died he embraced his son. Rev.
Father Magee of St. Patrick's church was
called in during the day, ami was with Gen
eral Garcia until the end, administering
the last rites of the Catholic church. Other
members of the commission aud Mr. Ru
bens, their counsel in this country, were
also in the bed chamber when the end
came, The remains were immediately pre
pared for burial, and were placed on a
bier in tlie room in which he died. A large
Cuban Hag served as a covering, aud the
head rested on one of smaller dimensions.
The face and bust were left exposed to
public view. The features had a remark
ably lifelike appearance, and gave no in
dication of the suffering which tlie de
ceased had borne. Just above the head
rested a magnificent floral piece of red and
white roses and cross palms tied with a
pure white ribbon. By direction of Major
General Miles, a detachment of soldiers
from Battery E, sixth artillery, at the bar
racks here, under command of Lieutenant
Cox, was detailed as a body guard for the
remains.
OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION.
After Genera] Garcia's denth steps were
taken to notify the government, and also
the committee of the Cuban assembly,
which has its headquarters at Marianao,
Cuba. Secretary Jose Villaon of the com
mission sent a telegram of notification to
Mendez Capote, president of the Cuban
assembly, who is now in Havana. As soon
as the death became known a number oi
visitors, including many public men, came
to the hotel to express their condolence.
President McKinley manifested his sym
pathy by sending a suitably wnrifoi"! letter,
and Vice-President Hobart sent his card.
Among tho-o who called were Senators
Foraker. Money, Proctor nnd Chandler,
and Major General Lawton and Wheeler,
MOURNING RELATIVES,
General Garcia left a large family, only
one of whom, Justo, and captain on
his staff, was with him when he died. His
widow and .Mercedes, a daughter, 17 years
old, arc at Thomasville, Ga., where the
girl is quite ill; Mario, a. son 19 years of ago,
is with the mother at Thomasville; and
Colonel Carlos Garcia, another son, is in
Cuba. A daughter. Leonora, who married
an American, is now iv Paris. General
Garcia's mother is still alive, and resides in
Havana.
HE SAW CUBA FREE.
General Garcia, whose name will be ever
linked with those of other patriots who
have fought against unequal odds for the
freedom of his country, has had a most
active and varied life, much of which has
been spent in fighting for the cause of Cu
ban liberty, which he had the satisfaction
of seeing accomplished bo short a time be
fore his death. He was a man of culture
and refinement, of splendid education and
came from a distinguished family of Jai
quani, of Santiago de Cuba province. He
was born in Cogquin, October 14, 1839, and
was therefore in the sixtieth year of his
age. General Garcia was educated in Ha
vana and in Spain. In 1864 he was mar
ried to Isabel Velaz. General Garcia was
the original conspirator in the uprising of
the Cubans against Spain in 1808, and in
that war under Gomez, he attained the
rank of brigadier general. In October of
1808 he captured the towns of Jaiquani and
Baire, and recruited many hundreds of
patriots. He had command of the eastern
departments during that revolution after
1873, and won many notable victories, in
cluding those at Mclonez and Aurez. While
the revolution was in a critical state in tlte
other provinces and its outcome was un
certain, he maintained it with vigor in the
territory under his command. In 1870,
while reconnoitering with his escort, he
was surrounded by 2000 Spaniards.
DEATH BEFORE CAPTURE
Preferring death to capture and subse
quent execution at the hands of his enemies,
he attempted suicide by placing his revol
ver under his chin and firing. The bullet
came out between his eyebrows. For months
he lay between life and death, but was saved
finally by Spanish surgeons, who possibly
had owed their own lives to his mercy. The
Spaniards, believing he wast about to die.
gave him a pardon. The scar which the
PRICE FIVE CENTS
bullet made when it entered his chin and
came out between the eyebrows was always
visible mid shows plainly in the calmness
ol death. For his participation in the rev
olutionary movement General Garcia was
sent to Spain, where for four years he was
confined in castles and fortresses, remain*
ing there until the peace of San Jon. Hs
then re turned to the United States and,
together with Jose Marti, attempted an
other revolution. He landed in Cuba with
a few followers, but the country was tired
of war and wanted to try the home rule
offered by Spain. He capitulated to the
Spanish forces in order to save his few re
maining followers, and was again banished
to Spain in 1880, where he remained under
surveillance until 1805, when the last revo
lution broke out in Cuba. Then he es
caped to France and later to Xew York.
Till': LAST UPRISING
His movements since that time and his
active participation in the war are familiar
to newspaper readers. After coming to this
country lie endeavored to get an expedition
to tlte island of Cuba in the steamer Haw
kins, but this met with shipwreck in •
storm and tlie cargo was lost. General Gar
cia was the last man to leave the vessel.
Undaunted by his failure, General Garcia
made another attempt to ship stores for
the insurgents, this time obtaining the ship
Bermuda, lie was intercepted, however, by
United States authorities and was arrested
on the charge of filibustering, but was re
leased on *3iX)O bail, lie forfeited this Kail
and in a final attempt landed on the eastern
coast of the island with one of the largest
expeditions that ever reached Cuba. After
landing he succeeded General Antonio Ma
ceo in command of the troop? of th'e-'east
ern department, holding the rank of major
general, General Maceo marching west with
his men. At Maceo's death Garcia was
elected lieutenant general of the Cuban
army, which position he held at the close
'of the war. During this command he as
saulted and took by siege Tunas, Guisa and
| Guaimaro, and cleared the interior of his
department of Spanish troops. After the
declaration of war between the United
States and Spain, General Miles, command
ing the American army, sent his representa
tive:, to General Garcia, and subsequently
the American and Cuban generals co-oper
ated In their movements against Santiago,
I All the officers who participated in the ae
j tive work around Santiago hear testimony
to the assistance and loyalty manifested by
| General Garcia dining the campaign.
HIS LAST OFFICE
j When the Cuban assembly met at th*
I ciose of the war General Garcia was one o<
| the principal advisers and was. elected chair
j man of the commission directed to th*
United tSates and conferred with the au
thorities here with reference to the work in
< hand. The iinal arrangements have not
I l>een made.
