Mr. Magoon in Cuba.
Mr. Maffoon is proceeding with caution in
Cuban affairs, and evidently with success.

observers the approval expressed at
the time he was sent to the island. Both
Cuba and the I'nited States were congratulated
on the choice of so competent a man
for work so delicate and bo difficult.
The latest news indicates that the next
flections in Cuba will not take place for at
least twelve months. At that time a new
house of representatives should be chosen.
ami the hope is entertained that conditions
will be such as to insure a peaceable and
satisfactory exercise of the suffrage. Party
spirit is still bitter, and may continue so
for .some months, but as nothing is to be
gained by mere bitterness, party leaders
should see the value of nominating candidates
and adopting platforms more with
regard to the general welfare than to that
of spoils huntinK or revenge for past offenses.
In a word, it is time for the people
to appreciate the fact that he will serve
his party best who serves Cuba best. There
is infinitely more at stak? than office, or
mere party triumph.
The end of American control is of course
not in sight. We went reluctantly, as the
President in his message declares, but now
that we are there and in charge we must
see things through. Tranquillity for Cuba
under Cuban officials must be assured be
fori- we can think of withdrawing. That
much is expected of us by everybody in
Interest, and that is at once the loslc and
the economy of the situation. Were we to
withdraw too soon and a condition follow
obliging our return, it would in all probability
mean the end of Cuban independence
and the beginning of permanent American
occupation. So that it is to Cuba's interests
as well as our own that our present stay
be determined by a safe forecast as to the
future.
Our presence is assuring all around. Europe
is not only satisfied, but rather hopes
for developments making it impossible for
u.i to withdraw at all. She Would hail with
pleasure the announcement of American
annexation, for in that case an experiment
would yield to a certainty, and Europe has
no sentiment on the subject but that of
business. As for Cuba, she has had so many
evidences of our friendships, there is no
ri.oin for either suspicion or impatience on
her part, and the sight of the stars and
stripes on the island should fill her not only
with confidence but with gratitude. It has
meant only good to her to far, and there is
no spirit in this country worthy of notice,
or at all likely to prevail, which would
change that meaning in the slightest.
The Park Policemen.
Tiie District Commissioners are asking
Congress for the formal transfer of the
parks of Washington, except those surrounding
the public buildings, to their
Jurisdiction. T>he superintendent of public
buildings and grounds, who is now in
charge of the parks, is asking that the
\ . > L- 1? ?i --
yuu. emeu uc sivcii <111 increase 01
pay commensurate with their duties and
to balance the pay increases which have
recently been given to the members of the
metropolitan police force. It would seem
as though the best solution of the latter
problem would be the 'grant of the Com
mlssioners' request, so that all policemen
In the District, whatever their fields of
operation, would fall directly under the
ir.unicipal administration and be subject to
tlie same rules and requirements and releive
the same pay.
The drawing of boundary lines around
the reservations to delimit the jurisdiction
of the park police on the one side and the
metropolitan police on the other Is an
anomaly which cannot too soon be cured.
nM,/> * * *
a iic iwn iv sjiatta are as rnucn an integral
portion of the local area requiring police
service as the streets. Yet the United
States enjoys exclusive title to the streets,
while looking to the District government
for their proper care and supervision. The
District pays one-half of the compensation
of the park police and J -.s no part
In their control or direction.
It is true, as Col. Bromwell urges, as
set forth in an article printed in the news
columns ti>day, that the park police are
seriously underpaid. Their duties are responsible
and exacting, and they are required
to maintain the same standard of
performance and appearance as the Dis11\fi

are not entitle J to the benefits of the
retirement and pension provisions.
Many awkward situations arise annually
hi a result of the division of Jurisdiction.
Tue Commissioners are charged with the
preservation of the public peace, and yet
are unable directly to maintain order in
a vi-ry large portion of the local area, ow
jng io nit- retention oy tne united states
of police authority over the reservations.
This matter should be easy of adjustment.
But whether the entire policed area Is to
be given over to the municipal control or
not, there should be no delay In granting:
the petition of the park policemen for living
pay.

Shop Early.
The shoDDer who does his Christmas hnv
Ing early ordinarily does so because it is
easier, in gome respects cheaper, and in all
rt';\i><-cts more satisfactory. That is pursuing
the principles of civilization, which Is
defined as enlightened self-interest. But
?) .. ita atil 1 anftthfr rmia/\r> far Aarlw
day shopping, which is equally a matter of
civilization, being a question of humane impulses.
The true blend of selfishness and
consideration for others makes the ideal
citizen, and from certain points of view at
this time of year the shopper who does all
liis business with the stores ahead of the
last days is a close approximation of that
Ideal.
The humanities demand early shopping
because it relieves the clerks behind the
counters, the clerks in the book-keeping departments,
the package boys, the delivery
wagon drivers and the horses. It makes
things easier and smoother and better all
around. It lessens the chances of mistakes
and thereby lightens the burdens that are
laid so heavily at this time of the year upon
a largo class of people connected with tha
retail business.
A glance at the places where the big
stores of Washington discharge the packages
that have beea purchased for delivery
will suggest that the people of this city
are in a commendable degree respecting
the admonition to buy their Christmas
goods early. They have very generally
heeded the appeals of the merchants and
the suggestions of others who are Interested
in the welfare of the store workers. But
they can do better. They can relieve the
final rush by fifty per cent 'if each will
advance the day of final purchasing by one
week.
In the old days when people made their
own Christmas gifts, crewel work, fret-sawwork,
embroidery, plain and fancy sewing,
carpentry and painting, they started in early
on their tasks Weeks before even months
before Christmas they were busy with
needle, saw, brush and hammer, fashioning
the presents that meant so much to both
giver and receiver. Nowadays few people
manufacture their own Christmas gifts. If
they did they would appreciate to the full
flu* nloa nf tho ctnm irnrlfAra fnr pnnsiflpr?
tion at this season. The lardy Christmas
buyers are trying: to make other people
hustle for them. If they had lived a fewdecades
ago and. practicing the domestic
arts that yielded the great majority of the
holiday tokens of love and e3teem then exchanged,
had assumed the same attitude toward
their enterprise of gift production
that they do today toward their gift buying,
their presents would have been ready some
time in the spring.
The Verdict at Herkimer
The verdict of "guilty" rendered at Herkimer,
N. Y., in the Gillette murder trial will
doubtless meet the approval of a large majority
of the people who have been following
this case. If ever there was a man on
trial for his life whose own story tended to
destroy sympathy for him, that man was
Gillette. His narrative was in the first
place inconsistent and obviously untruthful
In places. He admitted misstating the
tirctfmstances. He could not be believed
In any? particular after having thus impeached
his own credibility.
A sentiment against the defendant was
created at the outset of the trial by the
reading of the letters written to him by his
victim. They were remarkable letters, the
outpourings of a heart full of love and
faith, expressions of patient suffering which
commanded profound respect for their no- j
bility. Considered as the letters of a girl j
of slight education, a factory employe with
doubtless the average environment of her
class, they were worthy of preservation for
their literary value, even though they
lacked rhetorical refinements.
That such a woman, capable of such feelings
and fidelity, should have been so cruelly
treated by her lover and finally done to
death shocked the whole country. However
slight the evidence may have been to convict
Gillette of the crime of murder, however
circumstantial in character. His chance
of acquittal' dwindled with each word that
fell from the lips of the prosecutor as he
read the tender, appealing, piteous missives
of Grace Brown.
During the progress of the trial it was
common to hear men of sound judgment
and conservative views say of this defendant
that "he ought to be convicted on general
principles." There is undoubtedly a
bitter animosity on the part of most men
of clean and moral life against the scoundrels
who destroy virtue, who drag their victims
down into degradation, who besmirch
reputations and wreck lives. These wretches
nt-iuum uine meir proper places in court.
They are not often caught. Only occasionally
do the consequences of their villainy
involve them with the law, and then
but rarely are they convicted of offenses
so grave as to warrant extreme punishment.
It is this circumstance that doubtless
caused the widespread expression of the
hope that the Herkimer jury could and
would find Gillette guilty.
If this case should prove a lesson to young
men and women and a warning sufficient to
deter them from moral lapses It will not
have been a waste of life. Yet the horrible
examples 01 wrong-uoing are consianny Defore
the world and still there remain
enough moral cowards and lustful scoundrels
among the men and enough weak
women to tell a continuous tale of woe.
The field of the home missionaries is wide
and Inviting. Our young people need their
merciful and patient services more sorely
than do the savages of the dark lands far
beyond the sea.
Criticisms of the Message.
Knt Imnrnhahlv tho mnct intoroatir>?y rHa
cussions of the President's message in Congross
will take place in the cloak rooms,
and so will not appear in the Congressional
Record. Such 1b often the case, and especially
as respects a President with pronounced
views arid a pronounced way of
putting them. On several occasions Mr.
Cleveland stirred members of his party to
criticisms which had they appeared in
print would have startled the country, and
changed the political current of things for
their authors. Still when men are so
moved in their private deliverances their
public deliverances in some measure show
the influence of their feelings. The more
it is studied the more this latest message
of Mr. Roosevelt strikes the reader as a
paper not only certain of wide Immediate
attention, but containing matter destined
to occupy the voters for some time to come.
There is not a commonplace paragraph In
it, nor one whose suggestions can be disposed
of In a day.
The holidays will give just about enough
time to senators and representatives who
are so disposed to learn the President's
message by heart.
It is evident that there are two subjects
on which the President does not quite agree
with the Supreme Court, spelling reform
aiiu liit; iiicuiiic ua.
Young Gillette may be disappointed by
the jury's verdict, but he can hardly be
surprised.
San Francisco will hardly go so far as to
declare that it has no care for a treaty
made by the national government.
The 25th Infantry.
Let us have all the facts in the case of
the 25th Infantry. The country is curious
on the subject, and entitled to have its
curiosity satisfied. Presumably the President
is prepared to explain the steps he has
taken, and it is certain that some of them,
?o far as popular judgment is concerned,
??ed explanation.
As matters stand, two opinions ha%-e been
xoressed in condemnation of the President's
course, one of them by several men
of distinguished military reputation. It is
held that dismissal for the three companies
was by far too severe a sentence. Thi
reputation of the great majority of the men
was good, both in time of peace and in time
of war, and this should have weighed
heavily in their favor in the circumstances
surrounding the Brownsville episode. Whatever
occurred on the night of the "shooting
up" of the Texas town, only a few men
could have been the actual perpetrators,
and they mignt easny nave Kept Knowledge
of their designs, and subsequently their
performances, from their comrades. So
that it may not have been In every case
a soldier's natural aversion to "squealing"
which kept the men silent under catechism.
Many of them may have known nothing to
relate about the tragedy.
In the second place It la doubted in many
quarters if such treatment would have
been meted out to white troops. Nor is
this view confined to negroes. Many white
men share It, and consider that aa injur)
has been done whose effect extends fai
beyond the immediate victims. Among the
negroes this opinion is all but universal
and while some of their leaders have expressed
It In terms far from judicious, its
1 ?~
lccii luice i riuaiua.
And bearing upon this opinion is the
charge that the negro soldiers at Brownsville
were unpopular by reason of their
color, and to support this now comes a representative
from Texas with a bill classing
the negroes with savages, and providing for
the mustering out of all negro troops at
present in the service of the government.
We need not take this too seriously, for It
is certain that in a war between the United
States and a foreign power Texas troops
would not hesitate to go into action alongside
of negro troops, and in a hot corner
would be far from declining their assistance.
Still it shows a state of feeling In
Texas at this time from which negro aol
diers are hardly assured of fair play.
But these men, as all men, niuiit abide
by whatever Is shown to be right. If the
President's ea^e is stronger than appears
on its face he should welcome an opportunity
to present it in full. If, on the
other hand, Innocent men have suffered
by reason of a too drastic application oi
discipline he should be quite as willing to
undo any wrong inflicted.
rnu- ?' ? *i? moaoaVO
J ne inemtven in tire i
to bills which have "past" the House of
Representatives prove that the graver
problems of national economy have not
distracted his attention from spelling reform.
The District of Columbia should indeed
be a model of government for the states
to profit by. And in order to preserve its
dignity and enable it to set a just precedent
its local offices should be filled by local
men.
It looks as if Individuals whose Incomes
are derived from a corporation ought to
be willing to keep a campaign fund going
without calling a meeting of the board of
directors.
Count Bonl is writing for a newspaper in
Paris. In this country such an arrangement
would be called the yellowest kind of
Journalism.
The trip to Panama enables the President's
message to take on a sort of "to-becontinued-in-our-next"
interest.
In addition to being highly prosperous this
country has reason to rejoice that the
dangers of foot ball are abating.
Caruso can understand why it is that a
trust magnate so resents a fine which in
actual cash is the merest bagatelle.
SHOOTING STABS.
His Temperament.
"What kind of a disposition has our dyspeptic
friend?"
"None at all?only an indisposition."
NoTYet.
"Do you regard yourself as a reformer?"
asked the friend.
"Not yet," answered Senator Sorghum,
"but after people get tired of some of the
new ideas I may come to the front and
help reform them back to the old ways."
Sure to Come.
Now let the gathering statesmen fling
Defiant banners bravely out.
-We know there will be quarreling.
Though not, as yet, just what about.
Mild Approbation.
"I suppose you enjoy classical music,"
said the artistic person.
"No," answered Mr. Cumrox, "I don't exactly
enjoy it. But as a social diversion it's
more interesting than trying to keep up a
conversation."
Her Gentle Suggestion.
"Why don't people begin their Christmas
shopping right away?" Mr. Torkins inquired.
"Perhaps, Charley dear," answered his
wife, "it's because the races haven't been
away long enough to give them a chance
to save up money."
The Finish.
What e'er the enterprise you start
That gleams with roseate hopes so gay.
Some mercenary plays a part'
And coldly calls on you to pay.
The glow of a poetic soul
Must pale and flicker, fade and flit.
Unless he has the price of coal.
This is the finish: "Please remit."
In hours of grief or friendly cheer.
And e'en 'midst heroism's thrill.
Some heartless one is hovering near
In wailing to present a bill.
Though we quote maxims sagely bland,
Though we extol the man of wit,
King Midas wields the scepter, and
JL Illo IS U1W Illiiall. rtJUUt.
Sympathy With California.
From the New York Herald.
It is significant that in the long series ol
interviews collected by the Herald in connection
with Japan's Callfornian dispute,
interviews with men of all political
creeds, with men representing every
branch of American activity, business, law
the educational profession, diplomacy; interviews
with men from widely separated
states, with senators, congressmen and
members of the parliamentary committee*,
a decided tendency is displayed to uphold
California Individually and collectively.
These men realize that in its final form
the conflict would De one Detween Japan
and America. And their sympathies go
unanimously to the tatter.
Only an Emphatic Form of Assurance.
From the Baltimore American.
The expressed purpose of President
Roosevelt to use the armed forces of th?
country to protect the rights of Japan
under the treaty Is qualified by the phrase,
"which I may lawfully employ." As a
matter of fact, he could not lawfully employ
a single soldier against a state in such
a case, ana tnere is noming in tnis tnreat
but an emphatic form of assurance to
Japan that no stone will be left unturned
to secure that nation a square deal.
Christmas Shopping.
From the Birmingham Age-Herald.
Charities and the Commons, published in
Npw York, savs to all Christmas shonners:
"Please buy your presents early?early In
the day and early in December. That will
be your biggest gift of the holidays?to the
workers behind the counters and on the delivery
wagons." This Is an appeal in behalf
of all the young women and the girls
and the boys who have to withstand the
wear and tear of Christmas shopping.
Block Signals and Blockheads.
From the New Orleans Times-Democrat.
It begins to look as though the block system
is not much of a success when blockheads
are placed in charge of it.
Higher.
From the St. Louis Globe-Democrat.
The sugar trust has been fined again.
Sugar can consequently be quoted a little
firmer.
Perhaps He Mutinied.
From the Lndtanmpolls Star.
The woman who asks divorce after forty
years of married life impeaches her own
quality as a disciplinarian.
And This From Beertown!
From the Milwaukee Sentinel.
Washington will presently resume lta
floating population and Intermittent importance.
