President's Message
WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. 2.
To (Ae Ser&le aud Hougi of Bepruenta
Uta: In transmitting to yon this, my
fourth annual message, it is with
thankfulness to the Giver of all
Good, that, as a nation, we have
been blessed for the past year with
peaca at home, peace abroad, and a
general prosperity, Tonchsafed to
but few people. With the exception
of the recent devastating fire, which
swept from the earth with a breath,
as it were, millions of accumulated
wealth in the city of Boston, there
has been no overshadowing calami
ty to record. It is gratifying to
note, how, like their fellow-citizens
of the city of Chicago, under simi'
lar circumstances a year earlier, the
citizens of .Boston are rallying ;un
der their misfortunes, and the pros'
pect that their energy and persever
ance will overcome all obstacles and
show the same prosperity soon that
they would had no disaster befallen
them. Otherwise we have been free
from pestilences, war and calamities
which olten overtake nations, and,
as far as human judgment can pen-
trate the future, no cause seems to
exist to threaten our future peace,
When Congress adjourned, in
June last, a question bad been rais
ed by Great Britain, and was then
pending, which for a time seriously
imperiled the settlement by friendly
arbitration of the grave differences
between this government and that
of ber Britannic Majesty, which, by
tbc treaty .of Washington, had been
referred to the Tribunal of Arbitra
tion which had met at Geneva, in
Switzerland. The arbitrators, how
ever, disposed of the question,
which had jeopardized the whole of
the treaty and threatened to involve
the two nation in the most unhappy
relations toward each other, in a
manner entirely satisfactory to this
government, and in accordance with
the views and the policy which it had
maintained. The tribunal which
had convened at Geneva in Decem
ber, concluded its laborious session
on the 14th day of September last,
on which day, having availed itself
of the discretionary power given to
it by the tieaty toward a sum in
gross, it made its decision, whereby
it awarded the sum of fifteen mil
lions five hundred thousand dollars
in gold as the indemnity to be paid
by Great Britain to the United
States, for the satisfaction of all the
claims referred to its consideration.
This decision happily disposes of a
longstanding difference between the
two governments, and.in connection
with another award made by the
German Emperor, under a reference
to him by the same treaty, leaves
these two governments without a
shadow upon the friendly relations
which it is my sincere hope mav for
ever remain unclouded. The report
ot the agent or the United states
appointed to attend the Geneva Tri
bunal, accompanied by the protocols
oi the proceedings of the arbitra'
tors; the arguments of the counsel
of both governments; the award of
the tribunal, and the opinion given
by the several arbitrators, are trans
mitted herewith. I have caused to
be communicated -to the beads of
the three friendly Powers, who com
plied with the joint request made to
them under the treaty the thanks of
this government for the appoint
ment oi arbitrators made by them
respectively, and also my thanks to
the eminent personages named bv
them; and my approbation of the
dignity, patience, impartiality, and
great aDinty with which they dis
charged their arduous and high
functions. Her Majesty's govern
ment has communicated to me its
appreciation by Her Majesty of the
ability and induiatigable industry
displayed by .air. Adams, the arbi
trator named on the part of this
government, during the protracted
inquiries and discussion of the tri
bunal. I cordially unite with Her
Majesty in this appreciatiou. It is
due to the agent of the United
States before the the tribunal to re
cord my high appreciation of the
marked ability, unwearied patience,
and the prudence and discretion
with which he has conducted the
very responsible and delicate duties
committed to him, as it is also due
to the learned and eminent counsel
who attended the tribunal on the
part of this government, to express
my sense of the talents and wisdom
which they brought to bear in the
attainment of the result so happily
reached. It will be the province of
Congress to provide for the distrib
ution among those who mav be en
titled to it of their respective shares
or the money to be paid.
Although tho sum awarded is not
payable until a year from the date
ol the award, it is deemed advisa
ble that no time be lost in making a
proper examination of the several
cases in which indemnification may
be due, I consequently recommend
the creation of a Board of Commis-
sioners.for the purpose.
By the thirty-fourth article of the
treaty of Washington the respective
claims of the United States and
Great Britain in their construction
of the treaty of the 15th of June,
184C, defining the boundary line be
tween their respective territories
were submitted to the arbitration
and award of His Majesty the Em
peror oi uermany to decide which
of these claims is most in accord
ance with the true interpetation of
tne treaty ot iBio. His majesty the
Emperor of Germany having been
pleased to undertake the arbitration,
has the earnest thanks of this gov
ernment, and of the people of the
United States for the labor, pains
and care which he has devoted to
consideration of this long pending
oinerence. 1 have caused an ex
pression of my thanks to be com
municated to His Majesty. Mr.
Bancroft, the Representative of the
governmental Berlin, conducted the
case and prepared the statement on
the part or the United States, with
the ability that his past services jus
tified the public in expecting at his
bands. As a member of the Cabi
net at the date of the treaty which
has given rise to the discussion be
tween the two governments, as the
Minister to Great Britain when the
construction now pronounced un
founded was first advanced, and as
the agent and representative of the
government to present the case and
to receive the award, he has been
associated with; the question in all
its phases, and in every stage has
manifested patriotic zeal and earn
estness in the maintenance of the
claim of the United States, he is en
titled to much credit for the success
which has attended the submission.
After a partial investigation of the
case, and af the statements of each
party, His Majesty the Emperor, on
the 21st day of October last, signed
his award in writing, decreeing that
the claim of the govarnmcnt of the
United States that the boundary
line between the territories of Her
Britannic Majesty and the United
States should be drawn through the
Haro channel is most in accordance
with the true interpetration of the
treaty concluded on the loth of
June, 1846, between the govern
ment of Her Britanic Majesty and
of the United States. Copies of the
case presented on behalt of" each
government and of the statement in
the reply of each and a translation
of the award, are transmitted here
with. This award confirms the
United States in their claims to the
important arch ipeligo of islands ly
ing between the continent and Van
couver's Island, which, for more
than twenty-six years, ever since
the ratification or the treaty with
Great Britain, has been contested,
and leaves us, for the first time in
the history of the United States, as
a nation, without a question ot dis
outed boundary between our- ter
ritory and the possessions of Great
Britain on this continent, it is my
grateful knowledge the prompt and
spontaneous action of Her Majesty's
government in giving enect to tne
award, in anticipation of any re
quest from the government; and,
that, before the reception in the
United States of the awarcj signed
by the Emperor, Her Majesty had
given instructions for the removal
of her troops which had been sta
tioned there, and for the cessation
of all exercise or claim of jurisdic
tion, so as to leave the United States
in the executive possession of the
lately disputed territory. I am grat
ified to be able to announce that the
orders for the removal of the troops
have been executed, and that the
joint military occupation of San
Juan has ceased and the islands are
now in the exclusive possession of
the United States. It now becomes
necessary to complete the survey and
determination of that portion of the
boundary line through the Haro
channel. If increased population
shall enterand occupy the territory,
trivial contests of neighbors may
again array the two governments in
antagonism. I, therefore, recom
mend the appointment or a com
mission to act jointly with one that
may be appointed on the part of
Great Britain, to determine the line
between our territory of Alaska and
the conterminous possession of
Great Britain.
In my last annual message I re
commended the legislation neces
sary on the partof the United States
to bring into operation the articles
of the treaty of Washington of May
Sth, 1871, relating to the fisheries,
and to other matter touching the re-
lations'of the United States toward
the British North American posses
sions, to become operative as soon
as the proper legislation should be
had on the part of Great Britain
aud its possessions, which had not
been bad, and during the session of
Congress a question was raised,
which, for a time, raised a doubt
whether any action by Congress in
the direction indicated would be-
some important. This question has
since been disposed of, and I have
received notice that the Imperial
Parliament and other legislatures of
the provincial governments have
passed laws to carry the provisions
of the treaty on the matters refer
red to into operation. I therefore
recommend to you the early adop
tion of legislation in the same di
rection necessary on the part of
this government.
The joint commission for determ-
ing the boundary line between the
United states and British posses
sions, between the Lake of the
Woods, and the Rocky Mountains
has organized and entered upon its
work. It is desirable that the force
be increased, in order that the com
pletion of the survey and determin-
tion of the line may be soon attain
ed. To this end I recommend that
a sufficient appropriation be made.
Since my last annual message the
exchange has been made of the rat
ification of a treaty with the Aus
tro-Hungarian Empire relating to
naturalization; also of a treaty
with the German Empire respecting
consuls and trade marks; also of a
treaty with Sweden and Norway re
lating to naturalization, all of which
treaties have been duly proclaimed.
Congress, at its last session, hav
ing made an appropriation to defray
the expenses or the commissioners
on the part of the United States to
the International statistical Con
gress at St. Petersburg, the persons
appointed in that character proceed
ed to their destination and attended
the sessions of the Congress. Their
report shall in due season be laid
before you. Ihis Congress meets
at intervals of about three years,
and has held its sessions in several
of the countries of Europe. I sub
mit to 3'our consideration the pro
priety of extending an invitation to
the Congress to hold its next ses
sion in the United States. The cen
tennial celebration to be held in
187C would afford an appropriate
occasion for such a meeting.
Preparations arc making for the
International Exposition to be held
during the next year in Vienna, on
a scale of very great magnitude.
The tendency of these expositions
is in the direction of advanced civ
ilization and of the elevation of in
dustry and of labor, and of the in
crease of human happiness, as well
as of greater intercourse and good
will between- nations. As this ex
position is to be the first which are
to be held in Eastern Europe, it is
believed that American inventors
and.manufacturers' will be ready to
avail themselves of the opportunity
for the presentation of their pro
duclion, it encouraged by proper
aid and protection. At the last ses
sion of Congress, authority was
given for the appointment of one or
more agents to represent this gov
ernment at the exposition. The au
thority thus given has been exercis
ed, but in the absence of any appro
priation, there is danger that the
important benefits which the occa
sion offers, will, in a large degree,
be lost to the citizens of the United
States, I commend the subject
strongly to your consideration, and
recommend that an adequate ap
propriation be made for the pur
pose. To nirther aid American ex
hibitors at the Vienna exposition 1
would recommend in addition to an
appropriation of money, that the
secretary oi mu uvj uu .iuwiuu&
cd to fit up two extra vessels to
transport between our Atlantic ci
ties and Trieste, or the most con
venient port, to Vienna and back,
their articles for exhibition.
It is not without regret thatlhave
again to announce a continuance of
the disturbed condition of the is
land of Cuba. No advance toward
the pacification of the discontented
part of the population has been
made, while the insurrection has
gained no advantages and exhibits
no more of the element of power, or
of the prospects of ultimate success,
than where exhibited n year ago.
Spain, on the other hand, has not
succeeded in its suppression, and
the parties stand apparently in the
same relative attitude which they
have occupied for a long time past.
This contest has lasted now for
more than four years. Were it'seen
at a distance from our neighbor-
hood.we might be indifferent to its
result, although humanity could not
be unmoved by many of its inci
dents wherever they might occur.
It is however, at our door. 1 can
not doubt that the continued main
tenance of slavery in Cuba is amon.
the strongest inducements to the
continmince of this strife. A tern
ble evil. The abolition of slavery
and the introduction of other re
forms in the adminstration of gov
ernment in Cuba could not fail to
advance the restoration of piece
and order. It is greatly to be hop
ed that the present liberal govern
ment of Spain will voluntarily adopt
this veiw. The law or emancipa
tion, which was passed more than
two years since, has remained ino
perativc in the absence of other
ones lor its enforcement, it was
but a feeble step towards emancipa
tion, but it was the recognition of
right, and was hailed as such and
exhibited harmony with the senti
ments of humanity and of justic e
and sympathy with the other pow
ers of the Christian and civilized
world. Within the past few
weeks the regulations for carrying
out!the law of emancipation have
been announced, giving evidence of
the sincerity of intention ot the
government to carry into effect the
law of 1870. I have not failed to
urge the consideration of wisdom
the policy and the justice of a more
effective system for the abolition of
the great evil which oppresses a
race,and continuen a bloody and
destructive contest close to our bor
der.as well as the expediency and
the justice of conceding reforms, of
which the propriety is not question
ed. I am deeply impressed with
the conviction that the continuance
of slavery is one of the most active
causes of the continuance of the un
happy conditios of Cuba. I regret
to believe that the citizens of the
United States, or those claiming to
be such.are large holders in Cuba of
what is there claimed as property
and which is for bidden and de-
nounced'by the laws of the United
States. They are there, in defiance
of the spirit of our own laws,contnb
uting to the continuadce of this dis
tressing and sickening contest. In
my last annual message! referred to
this subject and 1 again reccomend
such legislation as may be proper to
denounce, and if not to prevent, at
least to discourage American citi
zens from holding or dealing in
slaves. -
It is gratifying to announce that
ratifications of the convention un
der the auspices of this government
between Spain on one part, and the
allied Republics of the Pacific on
the other,providing for an armistice
have been exchanged, and a copy
of the instrument is herewith sub-
mited. It is hoped that this may
be followed by a permanent peace
between the said parties. The dif
ference which at one time threaten
ed the maintenance of peace be
tween Brazil and the Argentine Re
public, it is hoped, are in the way
of satisfactory adjustment with
these States. With the Republics
of Central and South America, we
continue to maintain the most
friendly relations, It is with regret
however I announce that the gov
ernment of Vcnezula has made no
further payments of the awards un
der the convention of the 25th of
April,18GC. That Republic, is un
derstoood to be now almost, if not
quite tranquilizer. It is hoped
therclorc that it will lose no time in
providing for the unpaid balance of
its debt to the United States, which
having originacd in injuries to our
citizens, and by Venezuelan author
ities, and having been acKnowledg
ed pursuant to a treaty in the most
solemn from known among nations
would seem to deserve a preference
over debts of a different origin, and
contracted in a different manner.
This subject is again recommended
to the attention of Congress for
such action as may be deemed prop
er.
The money received and convey -
into the treasury during the fiscal
year which ended Jun30, 1872 were

r rom the foregoing statement it
appears that the net reduction of
of the principal of the debt during
the fiscal year which ended June
30, 1872, was $90, 960, 250 54. The
sources of ttiis reduction is as fol

with same at the commencement or

$99. 960, 553, 54. This statement
treats solely of the principal of the
public debt, which adds together
the principal and interest due and
unpaid, and interest accured to
datc,not due, and deducts the cash
in the treasury. As ascertained on
the day of publication, the reduc
tion was$ 100,5 14,591 28. The source
of this reduction is as follows. Re
duction in principal account, $90,

last table, the statements show a re
duction of the public debt from the

time, as follows. From March 1,
1869, to Marchjl, 1870, $87,13s, 772

toal. $303, G9G, 998, 87. With the
great reduction of taxation by acts
of Congress at its last session, the
expenditure of the government in
collecting the revenue? will be much
reduced for the next fiscal year. It
is very doubtful however whether
any furtherreduction of so vexatious
a burden upon the people will be
practicable for the present At all
events,as a measure of justice to the
holders of the nation's certificate of
indebtedness, I would recommend
that no more legislation be had on
the subject,unless it be to correct
errors of omission or commission
in the present laws until sufficient
time has elapsed to prove that it
can be done, and -still have suffici
ent revenue to meet current expen
ses of government, pa3 interest on
the public debt, and provide for the
sinking fund established by law.
The preservation of our national
credit is or the highest importance.
Next in importance to this, comes a
solemn duty to provide a national
currency of fixed, unvarying value,
as compared "with gold,and as soon
as practicable.having due regard for
the interest of the debtor class and
the vicis situdes or trade and com
merce, convertible into gold at par
Our treaty with.Japan remains
unchanged. An imposing embassy
from that interesting and progress
ive nation visited this country du
ring the year that is passing, .but be
ing unprovided with power for the
signing of a convention in this coun
try, no conclusion in that direction
was reached. It is hoped, however
that the interchange or opinions
which took place.during their stay
in this country has led to a mutual
appreciation or the interests which
may be prompted when the revision
of the existing treaty shall be un
dertaken. In this connection I re
new my recommendation of one
year ago that to give importance,
and to add to the efficiency of our
diplomatic relations with Japan and
China, and to further aid in retain
ing the good opinion of those pco
pie, and to secure to the United
States its snare of the commerce
that is destined to flow between
those nations and the balance of the
commercial world, an appropriation
be made to support at least four
American youths in case of the
countries to serve as a part of the
official family of our ministers there
(Jur representatives would not even
then be placed upon an equality
with tne representatives of Great
Britain, and of some other powers,
As now situated our representatives
in Japan and China have to depend
for interpreters and translators upon
the natives of those countries who
know our language imperfectly, or
procure for the occasion the em
ployces in foreign business houses
or the interpreters to other foreign
ministers.
Congress, from the beginning of
the government, has wisely made
provision Tor the relier or distressed
seamen in foreign countries.- No
similar provision, however, has hith
erto been made for the relief of cit-
izers in distress abroad, other than
seamen. It is understood to be cus
tomary with other governments to
authorize Consuls to extend such
relief to their citizens or subjects in
certain cases. A similar authority,
and on appropriation to carry it in
to effect, are recommended in the
case of citizens of the United States
destitute or sick under such circum
stances. It is well known that such
citizens report to foreign consuls,
and in great numbers, and though
most of them are able to bear the
expenses incidental to locomotion,
there are some who through acci
dent, or otherwise, become penniless
having no friends at home able to
succor them. Persons in this situ
ation must either perish or cast
themselves upon the charity of for
eigners, or be relieved by the
private charity or our own officers,
who usually, even with the most be
nevolent dispositions, have nothing
to spare for such purposes. Should
the authority and appropriation ask
ed for be granted, care will betaken
to carry the beneficence of Congress
into effect, that it shall not be nec
essarily or unworthily bestowed.
Since your last session, the President
or the .Mexican Kepublic, distinguished
by his character and by Ills services to
his country, has died. His temporary
successor lias now been elected with
great unanimity by the people a proof
oi commence on tneir part in his pat
riotism, and wisdom, which, it is be
lieved, will be confirmed by the results
of his administration. It is particular
ly desirable that nothing should be left
undone by the government of either re
public to strengthen their relations as
neighbors and friends. It is much to
be regretted that many lawless acts
continue to disturb the quiet of the set
tlement on the border between ours and
that of Mexico, and that complaints of
wrongs to American citizens in various
parts of the country are made. The
revolutionary condition in which the
neighboring republic lias so long been
involved, lias in some degree contribu
ted to this disturbance. It is to be hop
ed that with a more settled rule of or
der through the republic, which may
be expeeteu ironi tne present govern
ment, the acts of which just complaint
is made will cease. The proceedings of
the commission, under the convention
with Mexico ot the 4tli of July, 1808,
on the subject or claims, have unlortu-
nately been cliecKed by an obstacle, lor
tiie removal of which measures have
been taken by the two governments
which, it is believed, will prove success
ful. The commission appointed pursu
ant to the joint resolution of Congress
of the 7th of May last, to Inquire into
the depredations on the Texan fron
tier have diligently made investigation
to that quarter. Their report upon the
subject will be communicated to you.
Their researches were necessarily in
complete, parly on account of the limi
ted appropriation made by Congress.
Mexico, on the part of that govern
ment, has appointed a similar commis
mlssion to investigate these outrages.
It is not announced officially, but the
press of the country states that the full
est investigation is desired, and that the
co-operation of all parties concerned is
invi ted to secure that end. I therefore re
commend that a special appropriation
be mane at tne earnest nay practicable
to enable the commissioners on the part
of the United States to return to their
labors.
The favorable attention of Congress
H invited to the following recommenda
tions of the Secretary of War: A dis
continuance of the appointment of ex
tra lieutenants to serve as adjutants and
quartermasters; the adoption of a code
providing specific penalties for weli
delluel ofiVnecs, so that the inequality
of sentences adjudged by court-martial
maybe adjusted; the consolidation of
accounts under which expenditures aro
made as a measure of economy ; an ap
propriation of money for the construc
tion of a dcpotatSau Antonio, the title
to the site being now completed; nspec
ial act placing the cemetery In the City
of Mexico on the same basis as other
national cemeteries; authority to
purchase sites foi military posts in Tex
as; the appointment oi couiuiissary
scrgcants from ion-commissioned of
ficers as a measure for securing the bet
ter care and protection of supplies; an
appropriation for the publication of the
catalogue and tables of the anatomical
Kpntion of the Araiv Medical Museum:
a re-appropriation of the amount for
the manufacture of. breach-loading
arms, should the selection be so delayed
by the board of officers as to leave the
former nnnronriation unexpended at
the close of the fiscal year; the sale of
such arsenals east ot tne aiississippi as
can be spared, and the proceeds applied
to the establisniieui oi one large ar
senal of construction and depot upon
the Atlantic coast, and of the purchase
of a suitable sight for a providing and
experimental ground for heavy ordi
nance; the adoption of laws which de
prive inventors in the United States
service from deriving any benefit from
their invention; the repeal of the law
prohibiting promotions in the staff; a
continuance of the work upon the coast
defenses; the rejeal or tne seventh sec
tion of the act of July 13, 1866, taking
from engineers and soldiers the per di
em "ranted for the other troops : a lim
itation of time for the presentation of
the old war claims for subsistence and

Eiver and harbor improvements have
been carried on with energy and econo
my. Though many are only partially
completed, the results have saved to
commence many times tne amount ex
pended. The increase of commerce
with greater depth of channels, greater
security in navigation and the saving of
time, adds millions to tne wealth ot tne
country and increases the resources ot
the government. The bridge across the
Mississippi river at Rock Island lias been
completed, and the proper site has been
determined upon lor the bridge at la
crosse, loe able and exhaustive re
port made by the commission appointed
to investigate tne. sutra tunnel has been

The Secretary of the Interior reports
satisfactory improvement and progress
in each of the several Bureaus under
the control of the Interior Department.
They are an in excellent condition
The work in many of them has been
brought down to a recent date, and in
all the current business has been
promptly dispatched. The policy which
was adopted at the beginning of this ad
ministration with regard to the man
agement of the Indians has been as suc
cessful as its most ardent friends antic
ipated, within so short a time. It has
reduced tie expense of their manage
ment, decreased their forages upon the
white settlements tended to give the
largest opportunity for the extension of
the great rauroaus tnrougn tne puonc
domain, tie pusning oi settlements in
to the mere remote districts of the
country, and at the same time improve
the condition of the Indians. The pol
icy will be1 maintained without any
change excepting such 33 further ex
perience nay show to be necessary to
render It more efficient. The subject of
converting the so-called Indian terri
tory soutb of Kansas into a home'for
the Indians, and erecting thereon a ter
ritory form of government, is one of
great importance, as a complement oi
the existing Indian policy, the question
of removal to that territory has, within
the past year, been presented to many
of the tribes resident upon other less
desirable portions ot tne public domain,
and has generally been received by them
with favor. As a preliminary step to
the organization of such a territory it
will be necessary to confer with the In
dians resident thereupon as to farms or
nroner size, which should be secured to
them in lee simple, the residue to be
used for the settlement ot other inenu
ly Indians. Efforts will be made in the
immediate future to induce the removal
of as many peaceably disposed Indians
to the Indian territory as can De settled
properly without disturbance of the
harmony of those already there. There
is no other location now available where
a people who are endeavoring to ac
quire a knowledge of pastoral and ag
ricultural pursuits can be as well ac
commodated as upon unoccupied lands
within the Indian territory. A terri
torial government should, however, pro
tect the Indians from the inroad of
whites for a term of years, until they
become sutliciently advanced in the
arts and civilization to guard their own
rights, and from the disposal of the
lands held Dy tncai lortne same period.
During the last fiscal year there were
disposed of the public lands 11,864,175
acres, a quanty greater by i,uuy,.-)(U
acres than was disposed ot the previous
year. Of this amount 1,307,320 acres
were sold for cash: 389,460 acres loca
ted with militatT warrants. 4,671,332
acres were taken for homesteads ; 692,-
613 acres were located with college
scrip; 335487 acres were granted to
wagon roads; i14S2j acres were given
to States as swamp land ; 6,760 were lo
cated by Indian scrip. The- cash re
ceipts from all sources in the Land Of
fice amounted to $6,318,100; during the
same period :k,uio,7US acres ot the pub
lic lands were surveyed, wntcn, auued
to the quantity before surveyed,
amount to 583364,780 acres, leaving 1,-
257,G33,62S acres of the public lauds still
unsurveyed. The reports from the sub
ordinate Land Office contain interest
ing information in regard to their re
spective districts. They uniformly
mention tne iruitiuiness or the soil uu
ring the past season, and the increased
yield ot all Kinds ot produce, even in
tuose states ami territories wnere min
ing is the principal business. Agricul
tural products have exceeded the local
demand, and liberal shipments have
been made to distant points.
There were issued from the Patent
Office during the year ending Septeni
ber 30, 1872, 13,620 patents, 233 exten
sions, and 556 certificates and registers
ot trade marKs. .During the same lengtn
of time, 18,387 applications for patents,
including re-is3iics and design", have
been received, aud 3.100 caveats filed.
The fees received during the same peri
od amounted to ?iW,Uol,Si;, and the to
tal expenditures to $623,jj3,90, making
the net receipts over the expenditures
77,400,90. Since 1836, 200,000 applica
tions for patents have been filed, and
about 133.UUU patents issued. The omce
is being conducted under the same laws
and general organization as were adopt
ed at its inauguration, when only 100 to
oOO applications were made per annum.
The Commissioner shows that the office
has outgrown the original plan, and that
a new organization has become neces
sary. This subject was presented to
Uongress in a special communication in
February last with my approval and
the approval of the Secretary of the In
terior; and the suggestions contained
in said communication were embraced
iu the bill that was reported to the
House by the Committee on Patents at
the last session. The subject of the re
organization of the Patent Office as con
templated bv the bill referred to, is one
of such importance to the industrial in
dustrial interests of the country that I
commend it to the attention of Con
gress. The Commissioner also treats
the subject of the separation of the
Patent Office from the Department of
the Interior. This subject is also em
braced in the bill heretofore referred to.
The Commisssoner complains of the
want of room for the model gallery and
for the workinir force aud necessary flies
of the offices. It is impossible to trans
act the business of the ollice properly
without more room in which to ar
range files and drawings that must be
consulted hourly in the transaction of
business. The whole of the Patent Of
fice building will soon he needed, If it
Is not already, for the accommodation
of the business of the Patent Ollice.
The amount paid for pensions In the
last fiscal year was $30,109,310, an
amount larger by $3,708,131 than was
paid during the preceding year. Ol
this amount $2,318,40!) was paid under
the act. of Congress of lebruary li,
1871. to survivors of the war ol lb!2.
The annual increase of pensions by the
legislation of Congress lias more than
kept pace with the natural yearly losses
from tlu rnlla. Tim act of Congress of
June 8, 1872, has added an estimated
amount of $750,000 per annum to the
rolls without Increasing the number of
pensioners. We cannot, therefore.Iopk
for any substantial decrease In the ex
penditures of this necessary department
for some time to come, or so long as
Congress continues to so change the rate
of pensions. The whole number of
soldiers enlisted In the war of the rebel
lion was 2,6SS,523. The total number of
claims for invalid pensions is 176,000,
being 0 per cent, of the whole number
of enlisted men. The total nnmber of
claims on hand at the beginning of the
year was 91, 6S9; the number. received
during the year was 16,574 ; the number
disposed of was 39,978; making a net
gain of 12,604. The number of claims
now on file is 609.S00. On the 30th of
June, 1S72, there were on the rolls the
names of 93,403 invalid military pen
sioners, 3,318 widows, orphans, and de
pendent relatives, making an aggregate
of 208,923 army pensioners. At the
same time there were on the rolls the
names of 1,449 navy pensioners and
1,730 widows, orphans and dependent
relatives, making the -whole number of
naval pensioners 3,179. There have
been received, since the passage of the
act to provide pensions lorthewarof
1812,3,653 applications prior to June
30, 1872. Of these there were allowed
during the fiscal year 40,126 claims ; 4,
845 were rejected during the year, leav
ing 11,580 claims pending at that date.
The number of pensions of all classes
granted during the last fiscal year was
33,833. During that period there were
dropped from the rolls, for various
causes, 9,104 names, leaving a grand to
tal of 232,229 pensioners on the rolls on
the 30th of June, 1872. It is thought
that the claims for pensions on account
of the war of 1812 will all be disposed
of by the first of May, 1873. It Is es
timated that $30,480,000 will be required
for the pension service during the next
fiscal year.
The accompanying report of the Post
master General furnishes a full and sat
isfactory, exhibit of the operations of
the Postoffice Department during the
year. The ordinary revenues of the
department for the fiscal year, ended
June 30, 1872, amounted to $21,815,420,
37, and the expenditures to $26,058,192,
31. Compared with the previous fiscal
year, the increase of revenue was $1,
87880,95, or 937 per cent., aud the In
crease of expenditures $2,208,038,23,- or
929 per cent. Adding to the ordinary
revenues the annual appreciation of
$700,000 for free matter and the amount
paid to the subsidized mail steamship
lines from special appropriations, the
deficiency paid out of the general treas
ury was $3,317,765,94, an excess of
$389,707,29 over the deficiency for the
year 1871. Other interesting informa
tion relating to our rapidly extending
postal service is furnished in this re
port. The total length of railroad mail
routes on the 30th of June, 1872, was
57,911 miles, 8,077 additional inilos of
such service having been put into opera
tion during the year. Eight new lines
of railway post routes have been estab
lished with an aggregate length of 2,
909 miles. The number of letters ex
changed In the mails with foreign coun
tries was 2402,300, an increase of 4,
006,082 or twenty per cent, over the
number in 1871, and the postage there
on amounted to $1,871,257,25. The to
tal weight of the mails exchanged with
European countries exceeded 820 tons.
The cost of the United States Trans
Atlantic mail steamship service was
$220301,70, The total cost of the Uni
ted States occean steamship service, in
cluding the amounts paid to the subsi
dized lines of mail steamers was $102,-
702,080. The following are the only
steamship lines now receiving subsidies
for mail service under special acts of
Congress: The jfacihe Mail steamship
Company receive $500,000 per annum
for con veying a monthly mail between
San Francisco, Japan and China. It will
be increased to one million per annum
for a semimonthly mail on and after
October 1, lSi J. The united States and
Brazil Man Steamship usmpany re
ceive $150,000 per annum for conveying
a monthly mail between New York and
Kio Janeiro, iirazu ; anu tne uaiuornia.
Oregon and Mexico steamship Com-
nanv receive S75,U0O per annum tor con
veving a monthly mail between San
Francisco and Honolulu, Uawaian Is
lands: making the total amount of mail
steamship subsidies at present $723,000
per annum, uur postal communications
with all parts of the civilized world
have been placed on a most advantage
ous looting by improved postal conven
tions and arrangements recently con
cluded with the leading commercial
countries of Europe and America, and
the gratifying statement is made that
with the conclusion of a satisfactory
convention with France, the details of
which have been definitely agreed to by
the head of the French postal depart
ment subiect to the approval of the
Minister of Finance, little remains to
be aceomplised by treaty lor some time
to come with respect cither to reduction
of rates or improved lacllities ol postal
intercourse. Xour favorable consider
ation is respectfully invited to the rec
ommendation made by the Postmaster
General for an increase of the service
from monthly to semi-monthly trips on
the mail steamship Irsute to Brazil ; for
a subsidy in aid of the establishment of
an American line ol mail steamers be
tween San Francisco, New Zealand and
Australia; for the establishment of a
posioffice savings bank, aud for the in
crease of the salaries of the heads of
bureaus. I have heretofore recommen
ded the abolition of the franking priv
ilege, and see no reason now for chang
ing my views on tuat suDject. it not
having been favorably regarded by
Congress, nowever, i now suggest :
modification of that privilege, to cor
rect its glaring and costly abuses.
would recommend, also, the appoint
ment of a committee or commission, to
take into consideration the best method
equitable to private corporations, who
have invested tneir time anu capital in
the establishment ol the telegraph lines.
or acquiring tne title to an telegrapti
lines now in operation, and ot connec
ting this service with the postal service
of the nation. It is not probable that
this subiect could receive the proper
consideration during the limits of a short
session of Congress, but it may be mi
tiated, so that future action may be fair
to the government aud to private par
ties concerned. There are but three
lines of ocean steamers, namely, the
I'acine Jiau steamship company, be
tween San Frahcisco, China and Japan
with provision made for semi-monthly
service alter uctober 1, 1873 : the United
States and Brazil line, monthly, and the
California, New Zealand and Australi
an line, monthly, plying between the
United states and loreigu ports, and
owned and operated under our Hag. 1
earnestly recommend that such liberal
contracts for carrying the mails to be
authorized with these lines as will in
sure their continuance, if the expedi
ency of extenuing the aid ot govern
ment to lines of steamers which hither
to have not received it should it be deem
ed worthy of the consideration of Con
gress, and political and commercial ob
jects make it advisable to bestow sucli
aid on a line under our nag between
Panama and the western South Ameri
can ports. By this means, much trade
is now diverted to other countries might
be brought to us, to the mutual advan
tage or this country and those lying in
that quarter of the continent of Ameri
ca.
The attention of Congress will be
called, during the present session, to
various enterprises ior tne more certain
and cheaper transportation or the con
stantly Increasing surplus of the west
ern ami southwestern products to the
Atlantic seaboard. -The subject is one
that will force itself on the legislative
branch of the government sooner or la
ter, and I suggest, therefore, that im
mediate steps oe taken to gain aft avail
able information to insure equal and
just legislation. A route to connect the
Mississippi valley with the Atlantic,
at Charlestown, south Carolina, and
.Savannah, Georgia, by water, by the
way or the unio and Tennessee rivers,
and canals and siacK-water navigation
to the Savannah and Ocinulgce river has
been surveyed, and a report made by an
accomplished engineer ollieerot the ar
my. A second and third new route
will bo proposed for the consideration of
Congress, namely, by an extension or
the Kanawha and James river canal to
the Ohio, and by the extension of the
Chesapeake and Ohio canal. I am not
prepared to recommend what the gov
ernment sunn no to tuese or oiner en
terprises until it is clearly shown that
they aro not only of national interest.
but that, when completed, they will be
of n value commensurate with their
cost. That production increases more
rapidly than the means of transporta
tion in our country, has been demon
strated by past experience, and that the
unprecedented growth Hi population
ami products of the whole country will
require additional facilities, and cheap
er ones for the more bulky articles of
conimcrco to reach tide water and a
market Is equally demonstrated. I
would therefore suggest that a commis
sion bo authorized to consider this
whole question and to report to Con
gress at some future day for its better
guidance in legislating on this import
ant subject. The railroads of the coun
try have been rapidly extended during
the last few years to meet the growing
demand of products, and reflect much
credit upon the capitalists and mana
gers engaged in their construction. In
addition to these-, to facilitate commerce
by the building of a ship-canal around
Niagara Falls on the United States side,
which has been agitated for many years,
will no doubt be called to your atten
tion at this session. Looking to the
great future growtli of the country and
the increasing demands of commerce,
it might be well, while on this subject,
not only to have an examination and re
port upon the various practicable routes
for the connection of the Mississippi
with the tide-water of the Atlantic, but
the feasibility of an almost continuous
land-locked navigation from Maine to
the Gulf of Mexico. Such a route along
our coast would be of grea-. value at'all
times, and of inestimable value in case
of a foreign war. Nature has provided
the greater part of the route, and the
obstacles to be overcome are easily
within the skill of the engineer. I have
not alluded to this subject with the view
of having any further expenditure of
public money at this time than may be
necessary to procure and place all the
necessary information beforeCongrcss
in an authentic form, to enable it here
after, if deemed practicable and worthy
to legislate on the subject witnout de
lay. The report of the Secretary ot the
Navy herewith accompanying, explains
fully the condition of that branch of
the public service; its wants and defi
ciency, the expenses Incurred during
the past year, and the appropriation for
the same. It also gives a complete his
tory of the services of the navy for the
past year: In addition to its regular
service. It is evident that unless early
steps are taken to preserve our navy
that, in a very few years, the United
States will be the weakest nation upon
the ocean of nearly all the great pow
res. With an energetic, progressive
and business people like ours, penetra
ting and lorming business relations
with every part of the known world, a
navy strong enough to command the re
spect of our flag abroad is necessary for
the full protection of their rights. I
recommend a careful consideration by
Congress of the recommendations made
by the Secretary of the Navy.
The observations and reports of the
Signal Office have been continued. Sta
tions have been maintained at each of
the princigal lake, seaport and river
cities. Ten additional stations have
been established in the United States,
and arrangementshave been made for an
exchange of reports with Canada, and
a similar exchange of observations is
contemplated with theWe3t .India Is
lands. The report ot the Secretary of the Treasury
will show an Atarmtne fnllini; off iu our carrr-
ing trade for the past tcu orswelre years, aud
even for the past year. I do not believe that
the public treasure be better expended in the
interest of the whole people, than in trying to
recover this trade. An expenditure of 3,0u0,
000 per annum for the next five years, if it
would restore to us our proportion of the car
rying trade of the world -would be profitably
expended. The price of labor in Europe has so
mucn ennancca wuuin tne last lewyears tnat
tne cost oi Duucung anu operating ocean steam
ers in the United States is not so much irreat-
erthan in Europe, that I believe the time has
arrived for Congress to take this subject iuto
consideration.
Detailed statements of the disbursements of
the Department orjnstlce will be furnished by
the report of the Attorney General. Though
these have been somewhat increased bv the re.

The ninth census is about completed. Its

should receive the early attention of Congress.

the federal censuses is so long that the infor--mation

probably obviate the constitutional provision
regarding the dcccnnial.census, if a census in
1S75 should be divested ol all political charac

has been organized, consisting of two mem
bers from each of the States and territories.
This commission has held two sessions and has
made satisfactory progress iu organization and
in the initiatory steps necessary for carrying
onttha provisions of the act, and for execut
ing also the provisions of the act of Jane 1,
ISO, creating a Centennial Board of Finance.
A preliminary report of progress has been re
ceived from the president of the commission ,
and is herewith transmitted. It will be the
duty of the commission, at your coming session
to transmit a full report of the progress made,
and lay before yon details relating to the eihi- i
bition of American and foreign artists' pro
ducts and manufactures which, by the terms of!
the act, is to be held under the auspices of the
government of the United States in the city of
Philadelphia In the year 1876. This celebration
will be looked forward toby American citizens
with great Interest, as marking a century of
greater progress and prosperity than is re
corded in the history of any other nation, and
In serving a farther good purpose In bringing
together on oar soil people of all the com
mercial nations of the world In a manner cal
culated to Insure international good feelings, i
An earnest desire has been felt to correct
abuses which have grown up In the civil ser
vice of the country through the defective 1
method of making appointments to office.
Heretofore federal offices have been regarded
too much as the reward of political services.
Under authority of Congress rules have been
established to regulate the tenure of offices,
and the mode of appointments. It cannot be
expected that any system of rules can be en
tirely effective and prove a perfect remedy
for tne existing evils until they have been
thoroughly tried by actual practice, and amend
ed according to the requirements of the ser
vice. During my term of office It shall be my
earnest endeavor to so apply the rules as to
secure the greatest possible reform in the civil
service of the government, but it will require
the aid of Congress to assure the enforcement
of the system and fixing it upon my succes
sors, and I hope the experience of the past
year, together with appropriate legislation by
Congress, may reach a satisfactory solution
of the question, and secure to the public ser
vice for all time a practical method of obtain
faithful and efficient officers and ¬
