nourishing Condition of the DIock-Coal In
dustry Heavy Output of the Mlues.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
Brazil, lec 2, The output at the coal
mines was, perhaps, neyer so larjte as at
present The market has gradually widened
until it now embraces a largo field in the
Northwest. Two years ago' the celebrated
block coal was displaced by gas and oils in
the Chicago iron-mills. Thna thrown upon
the general market to compete with cheap
er grades, this excellent fuel suffered de
creased demand, while the bituminous en
joyed an increase. Then followed the
seven months' strike. Since thentHe block
has largely regained its old customers, or
found new, until the demand now is quite
large. The Ohio and Pennsylvania pools
have lost in proportion as the Indiana coals
have gained in the Northwestern market.
. besides an enlarged market, the fa
cilities for mining have greatly im,
proved. Now shafts have been sunk,
air and, electrical machinery have
been introduced, and a small force of men
can now turn out more coal than a much
larger did two years ago. Throughout the
district both block and bituminous
every mine is running and operators are
advertising for moremen. The State needs
two or more inspectors. The present in
efficient method will keep the statistics of
the industry from the public, while at the
same time not affording sufficient protec
tion to the miners. t
Bloodless Battle of Ballets.
pecla! to the Indianapolis Journal.
VixcnxNEs. Dec 2. Quite an exciting

deliberate put down his paddles and tired
five shots at the chief. One' ball cut
through his coat, another grazed his car,
and the others whizzed uncomfortably
near. Then Black reloaded, and deliber
ately aimed and tired a last shot. By this
time a Colt's revolver had been supplied the
chief, and when he opened tire on the fel
low he dropped his boat and scrambled up
the opposite bank, and escaped for the
time. Not Ion z afterwards he returned to
Indiana, and when pursued again he
lied to the river, but this time he was
headed otE, Still he waded into the
cold water t his waist, and striding a log
attempted to paddle down stream with his
hands, but be could not pet away 'by that
means, lie is now in lail.

HUGE SWINDLE THWARTED
Kcw York Speculator Commits Forgery
in the Hope of Securing 300,000.
To Help Out Ilia Scheme lie Identifies the Body
of a JSnicideas That of a Wealthy Enclish
m&nCase Unraveled by a Reporter.
New York, Dec. 2. Perrin II. Sumner, a
Broadway real-estate speculator, who
gained considerable notoriety with the
mysterious suicide of the man who regis
tered at the Getty House, Yonkers, as
George Smith, was arrested to-day by
Captain McLaughlin, charged with forgery.
The prisoner, it will be remembered, identi
fied the suicide as his friend, James H.
Edgar, a wealthy English chemist There
was a supposition that the identification
was not correct, and was made by Sumner
for the purpose of defrauding a life insur
ance company. The sequel tends to show
that there T'aa a swindle intended, and
that Sumner, apparently in the hope of re-
alizingtby the scheme the sum of $300,000,
did not hesitate to commit forgery.
The suicide took place on Oct 27. lhe
man passed under the name of George
Smith, and bad been stopping at the hotel
a number of days before he swallowed the
fatal dose of morphine. A few days later
Sumner visited the Getty House and identi
fied the body, as stated above. He de
clared that he did not relieve kdgar had
taken his on life, and hinted at foul play.
Captain Mangiu, of the lonkers police, ap
pealed to Inspector Byrnes, and an investi
gation was begun.
Dunng the inquiry bumner had stated
that he had learned of the alleged suicide
from George H. Edgar, a nephew of the de-
Ceased. He had the body buried at his own
expense, and the authorities began at once
a hunt for ueorge H. Edgar, now supposed
to be a myth. Sumner, when closely
Pressed, showed letters written by James
1. Edgar and his nephews, George 11. Ed
gar and Robert Rowe. all of which were de
clared by an expert to be in the same hand
writing. Sumner, besides, had a rather
Bhady reputation. On Nov. 5 he made
his reappearance at lonkers, . and
to allay suspicions asked for
the examination of the body for
further identification. When the coflin
was disinterred and opened be said to the
coroner: "Yes, that is Edgar." Afterwards
he said that Edgar was at least five feet ten
inches in height. The suicide, Geo. Smith,
was measured, and proved to be barely five
feet six inches in height. When Sumner
heard this be said the man was not Edgar.
He exhibited a picture which rosembled
the deceased. The police, satisfied that
they had thwarted a lifo insurance dwindle.
dropped the investigation, and up to the
present time tbe identity of the mysterious
'George Smith" has not been discovered.
UNRAVELED BY A REPORTER.
George R. Phoebus, a reporter, determined
to fathom the mystery, and for the past
three weeks has been watchinj Sumner.
He found that he visited a man of shady
character, who lived in the Ninth ward.
This man was the counterpart of the pict
ure exhibited as that of Edgar, but he was
living under another name. It was also
discovered that Sumner had made a propo
sition to lawyer Francis 11. lurner, of iNo.
45 Broadway, which was to have a man
personate Edgar in the drawiug up of a
will, of which bumner was to be executor.
The lawyer, of course, rejected the pioposi
tion, but, as he thought it would be well
to have the mystery cleared, he suggested
that he fand a man to act the part required.
He introduced Phccbus to Sumner, who
thereupon fell into the trap. The will was
drawn up by Turner and signed by Phoebus
and bumner. It was afterwards attested
by a notary public It was in the siguing
of the will that Sumner committed tho
forgery. It seems that Edgar owned prop
erty worth 300,000, of which Phoebus was
to receive 10 per cent, for his trouble. The
suspicion is that Edgar is a fugitive from
justtceon accountof some crime perpetrated
in England. It seems odd, however, that
if Edgar was a party to tbe deep plot he
did not appear in person, when Phoebus' a
services would be unnecessary.
The police surmise that Edgar was in
the dark concerning the bogus will, and
that bumner, who was willing to resort to
forgery, ultimately intended murder.
When Phccbus had led Sumner into the
trap, with lawyer Turner, he called at
police headquarters to-day and placed the
details of the plot before Inspector Byrnes,
who before making any other move decided
to obtaiu a warrant for Sumner's arrest.
This was done. and late this
afternoon the speculator, who resides
at . 429 Saint Nicholas avenue, was
taken into, custody. This is not
Sumner's first appearanco before tbe
public. On Kor. 6, 1684, he was arrested.
charged with grand larceny, at the instance
of a man named David M. Davidson. At
that time, it is said, he made a compromise
with the complainant and thus escaped a
convictipn.
Samper's friends say the speculator is ac
cused of 'forging James H. Edgar's sicna
ture to a power of attorney, making him
his executor. They say the signature
is genuine, and if the case ever comes to
trial they will be able to produce LJ d gar.
Their version of tho atlair is that Edgar is
heir to a fortune of $500,000, which is so
held in England that it is liable to fall to
the illegitimate offspring of his nephew.
George 11. Edgar. This, it is alleged, is
stated in the power of attorney, which
Sumner is accused of forging. It is like
wise stated that at tbe time of the Getty
House 'suicjde young Edgar drugged his
uncle and he remained ill nntil long after
the publication of the mystery and the
identification and burial of Smith's body.
Before Edgar recovered his nephew had
vanished, and is now supposed to be some

Cold Wave and Snow-Storms.
St. Paul, Minn., Dec. 2. The cold wave
that was centered over Manitoba yester
day mornins has progressed very slowly
southeastward, and was central this morn
ing over northern Minnesota. St Vincent
headed tho list of cold places, with 24 be

with . 22, 1S, 14 and 0 below zero. No
other stations reported temperature below
zero. It is snowing in eastern Mon
tana. South Dakota and Minnesota, with
temperature ranging from 6to2Sabove
zero. There are prospects that the snow
area will extend over the greater portion of
the Northwest in the coining twenty-four
hours. The lowest temperature at St Paul
this moiling was 4 above. It will go be
low zero to-morrow morning. A light snow
is now falling in this city, and snow is re
ported from other parts of the State. The
cold wave will have an effect on the In
dians, but may be insufficient to drive them
into the agency.
A cold wave struck southeast Iowa to-day.
and the mercury is 20 above zero. Snow is
falling. From Lyons, la., come reports of
a heavy snow and rapidly-falling mercury.
Snow has fallen all day and is still falling
at Cedar Rapids, and & blockade is ex-
Eected before morning, as a strong wind is
lowing. , '

' Southern Fairness.
Milwaukee Sen tineL
The election of Representative in Con
gress in the Seventh district of South Car
olina has been decided in favor of William
Elliott, Democrat. His Republican oppo
nent, Thomas E. Miller, received two-thirds
of the votes cast, bntthey were not counted
on the ground that the ballots it for him
wero not quite as long as the law required,
were not quite as white in color as the Dem
ocratic ballots, and read "For Representa
tive," etc., instead of simply "Representa
tive." etc. Neither the Democratic nor Re
publican ballots were in strict conformity
with the law.
'All on Account o McKlnley.
Cleveland Leader.
The Whytlaw Gineham Company has
purchased ground near Westport, Conn., for
a big gingham factory that will give work
to hundreds of employes, all of whom are
to be engaged in this country and not
brought from Scotland. Other Scotch gingham-makers
are also looking for locations
in this country. It's all on account of tho
McKinlev law.

The Standard Cocoa of the World,
HOUSEHOLD WORDS
IU1
TOPI
"BEST & GOES FARTHEST."
Now that its manufacturers are drawing the attention of
the American public to this yfry and,ever since its invention,
the best of all cocoas,it will soon be appreciated here as well
as elsewhere all over the world. All that the manufactur
ers request is simply one trial, or, still better, a compara
tive test with whatever other cocoa it may be; then Van
Houten's Cocoa itself will convince every one of its great
superiority. It is because of this superiority that the
EncrHsh paper Health, says : " Once tried, always used." .
