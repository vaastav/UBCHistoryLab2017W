730 HAVE NARROW ESCAPE
Women and Children Put on Shore in
baskets After Line is Carried to
Cliffs Suffer Intensely From Cold
and Drenched by Waves Being
Cared for at Halifax*
Halifax, N. S., Dec. 3—Canadian Pa
cific line steamer Mount Temple, which
struck on a ledge during a thick snow
storm early yesterday, will be a total
loss. Rooks pierced the steamer's
bottom, directly beneath the engine
room, and the terrific pounding she
lias sustained since she stranded has
further damaged the hull. The work
of transferring to the main land Hw
480 passengers and members of the
crew who remained on Ironbound Is
land all night, was resumed today, and
it was expected that by night, all
would have reached this city.
The sftvlng of all of the Mount
Temple's passengers, more than 600 in
number, under conditions dangerous
to the rescued and rescuers alike, is re
garded as a feat unexcelled in the an
nals of "marine disasters in the North!
Atlantic. When the ship struck the
rocks, hundreds of immigrants, among
whom were more than 200 women and
enildren, were thrown into a panic.
The officers and crew had difficulty in
making the foreigners understand
that there was no Immediate danger.
When daylight came and the storm
cleared, the panic was over.
Seas iiwept over the steamer for
hours, and the passengers stood waist
deep in water.' All suffered terribly
®6 -Vfrom cold. As soon as ordei was re
pL $ stored, line was taken ashore from
the vessul and by means of baskets the
women a.nd children were transferred
to the island. Within three hours all
were landed safely upon th&^aland
without accident. The male passengers
were taken off in fishermen's dories.
The steamship had 630 passengers
and a crew of 100, and altho they were
in the greatest peril for many hours
and subject to exposure to the cold
and privation for many hours more,
not one of them perished.
Guns were fired and rockets dis
charged in the hope of attracting at
tention and getting succor from the
shore. They were heard on the land,
but nothing could be done either
ashore or on board, and a long wait
began till daylight Then the .precip
itous banks of land were seen not
more than seventy-five feet away.
It was impossible to lower the pas
sengers down the steep sides of the
liner to the surging water below, and
Captain Boothby determined to try
landing them by a basket rigged by a
breech.53 buoy from the ship's rail to
the top of the cliff.
A b:.*ave crew manned one of the
boats and with superhuman efforts at
last succeeded in getting a cable from
the ship to the shore at the foot of the
cliff. With eager eyes the 600 pas
sengers watched the efforts of the sea
men^ Hope mingled with fear and
when at last the man made the cable
fast on land there was a cheer from
the sh ip.
Suspended from the cable was a bas
ket with ropes connecting with the
ship and the shore. Captain Booth
by ordered that the women and child
ren should first go ashore by the bas
ket By this time it was found that
the^oats also could be used.

BURNS IN DISFAVOR
English Press Gives Him Due Credit
For Defeating "Gunner" Moir, But
Is Not Pleased Over His Victory
Is Canadian, Not American.
New York, Dec. 3.—Altho giving him
all the credit for defeating "Gunner"
Moir in the heavyweight battle In
London last night, the English press
is not well pleased with the victory
won by Tommy Burns, according to
extracts from English papers cabled
here early today. The English believed
Burns to be an American, while as a
matter of fact he is a Canadian, and it
is evident that much of his unpopular
ity is due to that fact. Burns attempt
ed to make a speech when he entered
the ring at the National Sporting club,
for the purpose of explaining his na
tionality, but he was hissed down.
Eveh his victory after the fight, which
all admit was his from the third round,
was hooted. That Burns had all the
best of the fight from the beginning
is admitted by the Sportsman, which
says that Moir was badly used up,
while "Burns, on the other hand, had
not turned a hair, and not only left off
Without a mark, but even the parting
Of his hair was not disarranged." Con
tinuing, the same paper says:
"Under the most favorable condi
tions, Moir could never hope to make
any show with Burns, who will, despke
the disappointing display given by his
opponent last night, experience very
little, if any trouble in beating who
ever may be put up against him on
thiB side of the Atlantic."

made to his speeches hitherto deliv

.Japanese Ambassador Called
Home From Washington to
Give Information
IMMIGRATION QUESTION IS UP
Aoki's Government Wants to Know
About Attitude of Administration
Towards Measures to Restrict Coolie
Immigration—Probable Congression
al Action Causes Worry.
Washington. Dec.
3.—Ambassador
Aoki has been .summoned to Japan
by his government to explain person
ally the precise situation in this coun
try in regard to the Japanese immigra
tion problem.
The ambassador has been making a
very careful inquiry on his own ac
count thru various Japanese consular
officers into tho extent of the reported
race feeling existing In some sections
of the United States towards Japanese
immigrants. Already Baron Ishli, one
of the secretaries of the Japanese in
terior department, 'has made investiga
tion of the conditions existing not only
in California, Oregon and Washington,
but also in British Columbia on the
north, upon which he has based a
special report to his. But it Is believed
the purpose of the Japanese govern
ment *ln summoning Aoki to Tokio is
to secure from him Information
which Baron Ishii could not possibly
have acquired during his stort stay in
America regarding the attitude of the
administration here, with particular
reference to measures which have re
cently been applied by the Japanese
government to restrict the departure
from Japan for America of the coolie
element. Also the Japanese govern
ment desires a prudent forecast of the
likelihood of congressional action in
the direction of legislation .providing
for the exclusion of Japanese immigra
tion.

findings relating to peonage in the
south. Assistant Attorney General
Charles W. Russell makes a strong

as set forth therein. He also suggests
changes in state laws.

place a defaulting laborer in a position
of involuntary servitude when over
taken by the law are quoted.

CALLS REPORT ABSURD
Authority on Union Pacific Affairs

New York, Dec. 3.—The Journal of
Commerce says:
"The statement was published yes

Peculiar Case of Harry Shears,
Des Moines Pop Corn Seller
Given a Home
GOES BACK TO POVERTY
Rescued From Couple Not His Parents
and Given a Home by Representa
tive Hanna, Boy is Induced to Re­
turn to People Who Abused Him—
Legislative Friends Disappointed.
Special to Times-Republican.
Des Moines, Dec. 3.—Filial affection,
strong In the face of abuse and cruel
treatment. Has caused Herbert Shears,
the brightest page ever seen at a
legislative session In Iowa, to leave
new found friends and a chance of
a good home and a liberal education
and return to the people, who tho
brutally inhuman to him, have stood
to him in the relation of parents.
Herbert Shears was a popcorn boy
about the streets of Des Moines for
the past five years or
more'.
tlon In Des Moines.
His nat­
ural (bright disposition and unusual In
telligence attracted attention In every
office building In Des Moines where ho
went to sell popcorn. Smarting under
the abuse of the man and woman who
represented to him that they were
his father and mother, Herbert ran
away from home and sought protection
from cruel treatment at the police sta-
I
An Investigation disclosed the fact
that Jim Shears and his wife were
not the boy's parents but that he was
born In St. Benedict's home In this city.
The juvenile court took charge of the
matter and a law suit followed In
which It was shown that Shears had
never adopted the boy. Judge Jesse
A. Miller of the district court took
an interest in the matter and with
other ifrlends of the boy they fitted
Irinn with new clothes, gave him a
bath, burned his old clothes apd de
stroyed t) vermin that infested the
body of the boy from the hovel in
which he had lived. He was then
taken in by Representative Hanna,
of Benton county, who had become a
friend of the boy during the last ses
sion of the legislature when Herbert
was a page.
Where Herbert is now no one knows.
Jim Shears and his wife, who had
lived in Des Moines for five years,
largely off the earnings of Herbert
belling popcorn since he was 9 or 10
years old, were loath to see the means
of their easy support slip from them.
They sold their belongings and fitting
up a prairie scshooner went to Ben
ton county. They hung about Repre
sentative Hanna's farm and managed
to see Herbert. Fear and dread at
the cruel beatings he had received at
their hands and yet moved" by filial
affection for the only people he had
ever 'known as parents and the only
place he had ever known as home,
moved the boy and Representative
Hanna was finally forced to allow him
to return to Des Moines. From here
it was not long before he disappeared
with Jim Shears and his wife, and to
day no one knows where they are.
During the court proceedings here
when it was discovered that the boy
was abused and that the Shears were
not his parents, Judge Miller caused
Probation Officer Young to be appoint
ed as his guardian. Officer Young is
now the boy's legal guardian and Is
searching for the boy. When he heard
that Shears had left the Hanna farm,
and had come to Des Moines he made
dilligent search but was unable to find
him.
Representative Hanna offered to
be one of four to send the boy to a
military academy or some Institution
for boys. It would cost about $600 a
year to send him to one of the best
and Representative Hanna promised
$150. Before the boy's friends could
be seen to raise the balance, the boy
had disappeared. Judge Jesse A. Miller
of this city offered to be one of the
contributors of the fund and the mon
ey would have been quickly raised.
Postal card descriptions of the boy
have been sent over the country and
it is believed that he will be found.
Probation Officer Young is the boy's
legal guardian and the Shears family
have no legal right to him. Many a
prominent wealthy business man has
been attracted to the youth because of
his evident natural ability and kindly
disposition. They recognize that the
natural filial instinct, strong even in
the face of cruel treatment, caused
him to leave the fine home of Repre
sentative Hanna and return to the peo
ple who had mistreated him. It is
quite likely that a considerable amount
of fear fostered by the memory of
brutal whippings and stirred up by
Jim Shears and his wife hanging about
the outskirts of the Hanna farm had
a considerable to do with his returning
to them also.
At any rate the friends of the boy
feel that he is most too young to be
accused of acting in bad faith in re
turnhig to the Shears family. He is
too young to be guided by the wisdom
of experience. They are determined
to find him and will see to It the next
time that he Is placed where he will
not be bothered by Jim Shears and
wife and where he will have an op
portunity to gain an education ani
become a worthy citizen.
