R TUB PEEOmEKTB MESSAGE.
Hf r' Trot World's Washington despatch of yes.
K"1 terday propared our readers for the unique
BJK' ' snd remarkable Messago which tho President
Bfi Mnt to Congress to-day.
&4 Tho Message is brief, as tho dospatoh said
LHf$ It would be. It disauBses but one question
V the necessity of stopping the surplus by re-
Hp''t ducing taxes as The World's representative
H?' ras enabled to announoo would bo tho case.
Hwk i In thus prossing upon Congress the issuo
Bl' of " paramount importance," to the eioluslou
Bj?r ' of all others, tho President has shown a truo
Bftv comprehension of the situation. lie bus
Hr 1 I championed the causa of tho long ovor-bur-
K I dened taxpayers. Ho has mado himself tho
kj defender of business Interests Imporillod by
Htj' a prospective lock-up of money. And ho has
Bk supplied his party with what it has long
BlC Jacked an issuo and a leader.
Kt$ - In achieving this, the President has done
K ' Ttfhat Tnx Wobld has for a long tlmo urgod
B him to do.
h The statement of the injustice and tho
B danger of a surplus is clearly and strongly
K tnade. The one avenue of escape from tho
Ku' peril Is plainly pointed out. Tho "vicious,
H& inequitable and illogical" Tariff Law is fear.
H$!. lessly characterized. And tho recommends.
Hj" tlon is squarely urged of an oitenBion of tho
K' free list and a reduction of tho duties on the
K necessities of tho poople.
Hb TheProsident truly says that this is not a
H& question of free trade or protection. " It is
K;- condition which confronts us, not a theory,"
B.rt lie avers. And he declares that the " per-
B. rdstent claim made in certain quarters that
K all efforts to relieve tho poople from unjust
Hf find unnecessary taxation are sohomos of so-
HkT called free traders is mischievous and far ro-
Bf moved from any consideration for the publlo
Kj good."
B& The country and tho Democratio party are
R' to be congratulated on the President's bo-
HbaaM gacity and courage in Beizlng upon and
i forcing to the front the paramount issuo of
. Tai our politics.
ga THE BPEAXEE'B ADDBESS.
KV Speaker Oabliblx's inaugural address is
Bk the ntteranco of a progressive conservatism.
Hgi" He emphasizes the faot that " a revision of
B"' our revenue laws and a reduction of taxatiou
BH fire aVsolutely necessary." Aud yet ho
kJi. recognizes the other fact that in the interest
K of both capital and of labor "hasty and in.
K( considerate legislation" should be avoided.
ffir i A " moderate and roosouablo reduction of
BJk duties" is what the Speokor urges.
BHkI This is all that tho rev.nu. reformers oski
W ft slight abatement of the surplus-producing
Pfrf var tariff. Tho Speaker stands on tho tufs
BB? Bliddlo ground with the President.

TWO BIQNinOAlfT PA0T8.
, Samvxl Qoufbbs, President of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor, was a sympathizer
with the condemned Anarchists of Chicago
and labored with Gov. OaLEnnx in tholr bo.
half. It is fair to suppose that ho has a soft
sido for the adherents of tho red flag.
T. V. Powdeblt, General Mastor Workman
Of the Knights of Labor, Is resolutely op
posed to the Anarchista, and nil that (savors
of Anarchy. Ho has dovotcd his best efforts
to driving this clement from his order.
As tho Federation is gradually assuming au
attitude of rivalry to tho Knights, these aro
two significant facts that the intelligent
American workingman, who bolioves in
American institutions and American methods,
may well bear in mind.
A WARNIHO PROM MAINE.
Congress may find a moral and a warning
in a bit of criminal news from Malno.
A rich and tnisorly old f armor of that Stato,
who has spent his life in hoarding monoy,
was rolietod Sunday night of 982,000 of his
surplus by burglarious robbers.
Tho Treasury raiders aro now gathoring at
Washington to relievo Uncle Ham of his sur
plus. Itcmovo the temptation bv abating tho
oioesa, No man or party would daro to pro
poso new taxes to pay for jobs.
THE BARBERS' CONVENTION.
Somo vory sensible moauuros for tho ameli
oration of tho condition of tho journeyman
barbers of tho country aro proposod in tho
Convention at Buffalo.
The wielding of the professional razor
would appear to be a perennial joko, accord
ing to the funny papers. But, as a matter of
faot, tho barbers are ono of tho most over
worked as well as the most useful classes in
tho community.
It is certainly a vory reasonable proposi
tion that their work should bo limited to
olghty-six hours per week, and that the
prevalent custom of boarding with bosses
should be abolished.
Let tho barbers form thoir union, adopt a
good apprentice system, arrange for arbitra
tion of disputes, and insist on fair treatment
In tho matter of wages and hours. They
have tho sympathy of evory man to whoso
croaturo comforts they so deftly administer.
Mr. Hitneb, tho Malno mombor of tho Ito.
publican National Committeo, says if that
State goes Republican or Domocratio ono year
it is pretty apt to go the hnmo way tho noxt
year. But he rogards Nuw York as " differ
ent" and " more changeable." Somo pooplo
aro naver satisfied. An unbroken series of
Democratio victories for six yoars certainly
has tho aspeot of regularity.
The better France's now President is
known tho bettor Republican ho appears to
be. He did not canvass for a singlo voto.
Tho ofllob sought tho man. Moreover, ho
said ho would accept no election that de
pended in any degree on mouarohlal votes.
It is a good thing to have a Republican at
the helm of a Republic.
The synopsis of tho Prosidont's mossago,
printed yeBtorday oxolusivoly in Tub Would,
is a worthy sequel of Its groat Olsvklamd
interview. In " boats " at Washington, as
olsowhoro, Tnx World is usually ahead.
Of course, the corrupt Chicago ofuoials
rejoice and mako capital of tho decision in
tho Suaup case. As a bulwark for boodlors
hero, thoro and evorywhoro it is a great suo-cess.
Tub WonLD extends to its esteemed con
temporaries tho assurance of its most dis
tinguished consideration and bogs to remark
that it is a nowBpapor.
Congress did not have the official copy of
the President's Messago on the first day of
assembling, but it had Tub Wobld's truo
synopsis.
It was a cose of Tub Wobld's " moving
on."

Much b. It Was In Ludlow Htr.st Jail.
Jacob Sharp is not rocovering nis health as
speedily as was expected, and it was not
thought prudent for him to go out driving
to-day. Ho still keeps his room and spends
his time much as he did in Ludlow Street
Jail, lying on his bed and reclining in on
easy chair, alternately.
Thus far Mr. and Mrs. Sharp have denied
thomsehes to all callers, of whom thoro lmo

despatch stating, with circumstantiality, all the

to-day to Congress. This feat had lis parallel
when The Would hung the Chicago Anarchists
two hours before the faot, and sold the harrowing
details for a cent to its swindled readers.' There
was this difference, however: the Anarchists were
really about to be hanged, whereas President

FREDDt BEILIiVB CRDELTY.
Why II. Held III. Playmate, Utile Tommy
J ones, an a IXed-Hot tst.v..
Ten-yeor-old Freddy Reilly, who so tor
ribly tortured four-year-old Tommy Jones
yesterday at the' Home of tho Slstors of
Peaco, 78 Qrand streot, Jersey City, of whloh
both boys uro inmates, was arraigned in Jus
tice Stilsing's Court this morning.
The injured boy was uuablo to appear, as
ho is lying in a critical condition at the
Homo. Polico Capt. Parriortold tho story
of tho case
It seoms that the two boys were loft alone
in tho kitchen of tho Homo for a fow minutes
yesterday morning.
Young Reilly is described as a boy pos
sessed of a character purely doviiish. Ho
Iirovtd it by seizing his playmate, gagging
dm with a handkerchief, stripping him of
every stitch of clothing and holding him on
tun red. hot lids of the xitchen rango.
Tho gag prevented any outcry by the child
until he had been terribly burnod. When
it slipped off in his struggles his shrieks
brought Sister Evangeline to tho kitchen in
time to safe his life.
Dr. Gray was summoned and everything
dono to save thu child's life, but it is now a
(juestlon of lifo or death. Tho boy's Buffer
iiiL'S aro described as awful.
When Reilly was asked by Justice StilBlng
why ho burned tho child, ho answerod with
out a trnce of tears : "I was kinder mad at
him for soincthln'."
Tho was rcmandod to await the result of
Jones's injuries. A fow days ngo ho stolo a
bunk containing CO cents from a playmato,
aud for this ho was also committed.
Reilly is the son of John Reilly, onco a
wealthy crockery merchant. Since Mr.
Reilly's death soven yoars ago the mother
has become a drunkard, her llttlo fortuno
wanted and her children aro inmates of
asylums.

HIS VICTIM HAUNTED HIM.
VISIONS OF A SPECTRE THAT DEOTE JOHN
J, DSLANEI TO CONFESS.
Calm T.-Dy After Telllotr Folte. Capt.
Campbell, of Brooklyn, How Ha Admin
istered ttnt P.leon tn Pretty Mary Jane
Co Preferring; thn Prospect of Death on
tbe tlallorra to Tortures of Krraorso.
John J. Dolaney, the confessed murderer
of young Mary Jane Cox, who was found
dead in hor home, 140 Prince streot, Brook
lyn, on tho morning of June 3 last, is still
locked behind tho bars in Capt. Campbell's
station. hoiiMi.
When a Would rcportor saw him this morn
ing his fnco vi us worn and haggard. H!b eyes
wero sunken in his head, and hin whole ap.
pearauce gavo ovidence of tho mental strug
gle that ho has oudured since he deliberately
gave tho girl ho betrayed the poison which
she innocently drank and which caused her
death.
From that tlmo until tho present tho pris
oner has had but little peace of mind.
According to his own story, try at ho
would, ho could not escapo tho tortures of
remorse. No matter what expedients he re
sorted to, drink or dissipation of any kind,
tho result was alwayB tho somo. Ho could
never rest. Walking or while at work, awake
or asleep, his crime was ovor in his thoughts.
Ever, as ho says in explanation of his sur
render, tho spirit of tho murdered girl rose
before him. Hu saw her just as he loft hor
on that fatal night. There she sat in tho old
fashioned Uitchou chair which sho was so
wont to occupy during his visits.
Kvou tho glass containing tho sediments of
tho deadly mixture Roomed at her elbow, and
tho fuce, which In lifo was always pretty and
happy, appeared before him pale, appealing
and accusing.
In his sleep ho saw her. Tho spirit seemed
to hover around his bed. Ho would wake in
the middle of the night with perspiration
rolling down his face, and then tho figuro
would disappear. But tho moment ho sought
rest it would return and haunt him.
This lasted for months. H1b face becamo
pale and careworn. His companions no
ticed the change and wondered at it, as well
as at his forced merriment.
Then in placo of an occasional drink he
took many. His position, which ho strovo
hard to koep, was lost, lie found compan
ions in barrooms and among tho lowest
classes, and in thoir midst Bought in vain to
drown his haunting thoughts.
Dually, so desperate did ho become that for
weeks, according to the statement of a friend
of his sister's, the young man never drew a
sober breath.
Then, when at last tho strain seemed
nnbearablo, he determined to acknowledge
his guilt. What the consequences were, he
did not stop to consider, and last Saturday
night ho started for tho Adams street polico
station in Brooklyn.
The confession required more courage than
he posscssod, so ho began to drink. With
tho extra stimulant his timidity forsook him
and at tho station-house ho grow bold and
loft without any explanation of his visit.
Sunday camo and with it rotumod his re
morso. All through the long hours of that
day tho spirit of tho dead girl was before
him. He wye ho thought of the consequences
of a confossiou and resolved not to mako ono
for fear of the gallows.
But tne longor ho thought the weaker grew
his resolution, Until Sunday night, with a
full knowledge of tho faot that probably
death would be his punishment, Lo again
started for tho polico station.
This timo ho did not falter, but explained
his oonneotion with tho murder and told
how when tho girl asked him for medicino
he dollberatoly bought rat poison, mixed it
with water ana without explaining the nature
of tho mixture, gave it to the girl, who drank
ii turn uiuu.
A great load seemed taken from his mind
after making tho confession and he talked
rationally. When his statement had boen
read to him by Capt. Campbell, he acknowl
edged it. Then ho was locked up. For tho
first time in five months he found rest. All
Monday ho seemod easy and last night he
slept like a top. To-day he was perfectly
calm..
Delanoy is a young man with a smooth and
pleasant place and regular features. S'mco
the death of his father, who was killed on the

who died broken hearted, ho has gone to tho

Miss Juliet Corson's umbrella is restored!
When that good lady went to the Metropol
itan Opero-House last Saturday to enjoy that
Wagnerian pures, Blegfried. she supported
hersolf with an invisible-groen silk umbrella
and tho dollghtfnl thought of tho Gargantuan
mouth of tho dragon.
When sho loft all tho rapture of soolng
countless menus disappear, in fancy, down
tho Saurion's vasty throat was dispelled.
Somebody who does " not let his right band
know what his loft doeth" had abstracted the
umbrella.
Tho umbrella was a cherished stick. It
had an oxidized silter haudlu nnd "J. C
was delicately gracn on its head. But its
great value w as as u memory. It was tho
gift of u dead friend.
Miss Corson rushed into print. Yesterday
evening sho had heard nothing. Sho then
thought that sho would try tho Metropolitan
Opcra-Houso on a forlorn chauco.
11 You haven't limn! of my umbrella, I
suppose," she xaid to Mr. McLaren.
"Miss Corson, prepnro yourself. Your
umbrella is hero 1" said that worthy. " It
was handed in just now."
Tho abstractor of tho umbrella had brought
it back, but deliberately denied himself tins
unique chanco to w in n deathleBS fnmo as tho
Great Restorer who had brought back au
umbrella ,'
" It bus given mo n very optimistic viow of
human nature," baid Mis Corson to a Wonm
reporter this morning. " It suited mo so
well, and was not as conspicuous as a cano.
I havo a collection, you see," she said, point
ing to u numbor stuoked in tho corner of hor
bright littlo room, " but this lost one was
tho pet. Do say. If you writo anything about
it, that I am so grateful to the person v, ho
brought it baok. I fancy all sort of delight
ful motives that they could havo had in doing
it, and feel truly thankful."
DREARY DAYS FOR MURDERERS.
Dan Drlacoll a Hero of tlie Dime Novel Order
Tor Duu Lyon.
The days pass slowly for the condemned
murderers in the Tombs. Tho two Dannys
Driscoll and Lyons are looked up from
morning till night. They aro on opposite
sides of Murdorors' Row, aud thoir only re
laxation is to placo their mouths against the
bars and shout out greetings to each other.
A hundred times a day tho corridor reechoes
with such cries as, "Hello, Danny, how
d'ye like tho soup ? " " Cheer up old man,
I've had a good feed and I'm going to take a
nap."
Warden Walsh sizos up Lyons as a man
whose head has boen (urued by reading dimo
novels. Ho says Lyons looks upon Driscoll
as a first-class hero, and worships him ac
cordingly. " Lyons is tho smarter man, though," said
tho Warden to a World reporter this morn
ing. " Seo theso two iron bars that they cut
from thoir cots. Lyons had tho sense to cut
off tho curved end and use it as a jimmy.
Driscoll didn't know enough for that, and
sawed off a straight piece of iron."
Mr. Howo intends to move on Monday for
anew trial on the ground of newly discovered
evidence The case is the first to como uji
under the new provision of the code of civil
Srocedure and Mr. Howe is unusually con
dent of tho success of his application.
Sullivan and Blako, Lyons' counsol, got
the minutes of tho trial from District-Attorney
Martine this morning, and will arguo the
appeal in the early part of next month.
Adolph Reich, the wife murderer, is the
most friendless prisoner in the Tombs. Ho

mado botweon tho two gentlemen.
" A nolo in the Ground " will be given at
tho Fifth Avenuo Theatre next week. This
is generally looked upon as a remarkable

fact that tho play was presented at the Peo

there to a high-class house, thus reversing
the usual order of things.
