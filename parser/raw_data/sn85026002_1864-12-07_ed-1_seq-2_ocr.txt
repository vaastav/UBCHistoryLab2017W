THE PUBLIC DEBT.
The Public llebton the I at day ol July last,
as appears by the books of the Treasury,
amounted to one billion, seven hundred unci
(orly thousand millions, six hundred and nine
ty thousand, four bundled and eighty nine
dollars and forty-nine cents, (f I ,T IO,li!)D,4S9,-
4'J ) Probably, should the war continue lor
j another year, this amount tony be increased
' by not far from five hundred millions.
I Held as it is, for Iho moil part, by our own
' people, it has become a substantial branch nf
national, tbnuh private property. Kor oh
I vioua reasons, the more nearly this property
can be distributed anions all the people the
better Tn favor such general distribution,
greater inducements to become owners, niir.li',
perhaps, with good (Oect, mid without injuiy,
j be presented to persona of limited means.
S With this view 1 suggest whether il might not
J be both expedient and competent for Congre-s
.) ptovida that a limited amount ol some In
'I anon and Irom seizure for debt, under such
would render tha possession of such securi
ties, to the amount limited, most desirable lo

possible Hay ol want, i rtvucges nae mean

by any bona tide purchaser exempt Irom tux
well as debtors, is obvious Men readily per

the Slain system to Ibe Nationul system nre
rapidly taking place, and it is hoped thnt very
soon there will he in the United States no
bank ot issue not authorized by Congress, and
no bauk nole circulation not secured by the
Government. That the Uovernment and the
S ate II ink issues will bo for Cougrest tn

It seems quite clear that the Treasury can
not be satisfactorily conducted unless the Gov
ernment cun exercise a restraining power oyer

In a treat national; crisis like ours, una
nimt'y of actioti amoiiK those seeking a com-
mon end, is very desirnhlo almost indispen-
mid yel no approach lo such unanimity
is attainable, nnless somo delerence shall lie
to the will of the majority, simply he-
causa il is the willnf the maiurilv. In this
case the common enil is iho maintenance of
the Union, and among the means tn secure
'lint end, such will, through the election ia
most clearly declared in favor nf such cousti
lutioiial amendment.
The most reliable indication of public pur
poses in ibis country is derivi d Ibiough our
popular elections.
THE UNION SHALL BE PRESERVED.
Judging by iho recent canvass and ilsreenlt,
the purpnse of Iho people within the loyal
Slates to maintain the integrity of the Union,
was never more firm, nnr moru nearly iiuaui-
, mnHS mn miw. The extraordinary calmnea
I Rlll e(i or,)fr wj which tho millions of
TO,.rrt met and mingled at the polls gave
,ir0,K assurance of this, Not only all lliose
wn0 .ported the I'ninn ticket, so called,
1
but a great majority nf the npposiug party,
also, may be fairly claimed to entertain, and
to bo actuated by the same purpnse. It is an
unmiawi'i able argument to this effect, that no
en nil i .1 lit for a.y office whatever, high or low,
has ventured to seek voles with the avowal
trial he was for tiving up the Union There
has been min h Impngning of motives, and
much healed controversy as lo proper means
and I est inode ot advancing Ihe Union cause,
bat in the distinct issue of Union or no
Union, ihe people have .shown llieir intuitive
knowledge that there is no diversity amoui!
,hl, ,,pnple, in awarding the people the lair
opportunity ol showing, one to another and to
the world, this firuitirsa and unanimity of
purpose. The election has been of vast value
to tlie national cause. The cledion has ex
hibited another fact not less valuable lo be
knii' ti, tho tact that wo do not approach ex
haustion iu the most important branch of the
National resources, that of living men. Writ la
It is ineliiiichnly to reflect that the war has
tilled so many graves, and carried mourning
.o so many homes, it is some relief to know
that, run pined with the surviving, the fallen
have been so few. Whole corps, and divis
ions, and brigades, and regiments, have form-

which is probably true, Thu important fuel
remains uioiioiistrnt.eij tnat we have more meu
now than we hud when the war begun ; that
we are nnt exhausted nor in process of rx

nay, if need be, maintain the contest indefi
nitely Our material resources are now more
complete und abundant than over. The Na
tionul resources then are unexhausted, and,
we bulieva mexhaustible. I he public pur
pose to re establish and maintain the National
authority is unchanged, and as wu believe, un
changeable. The manner ol continuing Ihe

sideration ot nil tbe evideuce accessible,
