place. The groom is a very prominent
young man of upper York county
and the bride one among our most attractive
and intelligent young ladies.
The marriage took place at the residence
of the bride's father, William
White, at 3 o'clock yesterday, the ceremony
having been performed by
Jtev. J. M. Garrison. The happy
young couple left soon after the marriage

* Narrow Escape From Death.
Rock Hill Herald, Wednesday : A
scaffold 140 feet long and 14 feet high,
which had been erected on the first
floor of the new store of A. Friedheim
& Bro., fell with an alarming crash on
Monday while a number of men were
on it at work ; but fortunately none
were seriously hurt, notwithstanding
the scaffold was covered with heavy
plank, which fell upon and covered
nearly all the men. Mr. Hugh White
was more painfully hurt thau anyone
else, and yet bis injuries are not serious.
Messrs. S. T. Frew, Louis Friedheim
and J. S. Underwood, George Mobley,
Sara Jackson, Jr., Randall Douglass
and Charlie Foster were also on the
structure, and all but the last two
named received slight injuries. It is
a miracle that someone of the number
did not sustain serious wounds. Martin
Massey was also on the platfonn ;
but he clutched a strip nailed on the
sleepers and swung there until he found
a way to reach the flour unhurt.

NEW ARMY BILL.
Chairman Hull Thiuka There Should !t<
100,000 Men.
Representative Hull, chairman o
the house committee on military af
fairs, on Tuesday, introduced a hill in
creasing the regular army to upproxi
mately 100,000 men. The bill was
framed at the war department, am
has the approval of the secietary o
war. It is not the bill framed by Gen
eral Miles,as this measure has not tin
high rank proposed by the Miles bill
and some of the appointments an
open to officers of the .volunteer arnn
or from civil life. It provides for i
lieutenaut geueral and what is consid
e ered a sufficient, increase of major and i
3 brigadier generals to commaud an I
r army of 100,000 men scattered from <
j Puerto Rico to Mauila. I
The artillery arm is reorganized, sep*
arating them into coast and field ar3
tillery, but promotion to be by senioti- t
- ty of the whole arm. A decrease of en- (
f listed men is made, so that arm can j
be increased by recruits in case of war >
to full strength. The enlisted strength \
of an infantry company is not tc ex- t
" ceed 145, so that iu case of war new j
' regiments would have to be formed, (
. probably all of which would be volun- t
3 teer; but the regular army would f
, make a substantial first line. The bill t
provides for the three battalion forma- [

' The most noticeable change is in
* that of the medical department, in
' which provision is made for a hospital
corps of 3,000 privates, with the
necessary non-commissioned officers,
i with a large increase in the number of
t surgeons and assistant surgeons.
, All officers and men serving in the
( sub-tropical countries are to have aD
increase of 25 per cent, in pay.
Under the immediate control of the
' president, inhabitants of the new countries
may be enlisted in the organiza(
tions there serving.
, The bill gives a total of fourteen
( regiments of artillery, twelve of cavalry
and thirty of infantry.
MERE-MENTION.
Four men were killed and several
1 were seriously injured on Castle Island,
in Boston harbor, last Tuesday afternoon,
by the explosion of a mine which
the men were removing from the bottom
of the channel. The cause of the
explosion is unknown. Senator
Hale, chairman of the committee on
naval affairs, has introduced a bill
providing for the revival of the grades 8
of admiral and vice admiral in the ;
i navy. The Spanish newspapers
characterize President McKinley'e
message as discourteous. The grand
lodge of Maryland has followed that s
of Kentucky in refusing to acknowl- 1
edge Negro Masons. An explosion d

The report of Attorney General Griggs
to congress, shows that during the

States captured 56 prizes and realized 7

SOUTH CAROLINA NEWS. n
Three Ex-Governorg. \
Columbia correspondence News and a
Courier, Tuesday : There was a rather a
remarkable meeting in the Columbia tl
club this morning. It was by the merest a
chance that three ex-governors of ^
the stale met aud talked about old ^
times. The party might have been in- *
creased to the fourth ex-governor by
the presence of Ex Governor Richard- 81
son, who frequently meets with hisdistinguisbed
friends at the Columbia t]
club, of which he was president for so q
long a time. The three ex-governors
who met and chatted pleasantly this
morning in the parlors of the club
were: Governor Wade Hampton, Governor
Hueh S. Thompson and Govern
or Jobn C. Sheppard. Another distin- guished
member of the party was General
E. P. Alexander, who was on his way
to Nicaragua, where he goes on
business. o
State Immigration Committee. ^
Columbia Record : At the forth com- \
ing meeting of the legislature, Mr. .
Francis H. Westou will introduce a
bill which, if passed, will be of great _
benefit to the state. His measure 7
contemplates the establishment of an (
office to be known as that of the slate I
immigration commissioner. As the ?
name implies, the duty of the commisj-ioner
will be to induce desirable im- "
migrants to settle in this state. North
Carolina, Georgia and some other j
southern states have such an official, p
and statistics show that they have been
very succes>ful iu inducing desirable
settlers to come to those states. Gen- J
erally the duties will be to keep well ^
posted as to suitable lands in the state e
which may be bought, the price of the
lauds, what they are adapted to growing,
and to be able to give general -i
information as to the resources of the J
state. It is contemplated that he <'
should correspond with emigrants from r
Europe and states of the Union, and
possibly spend much of his time in New
York, where he could meet emi- ..
grauts face to face and turn them to J
his state. There is plenty of room in ^
the state for more white people, and it ^
can be easily seeu that Mr. Weston's ^
' idea is a good one. l ne question may ;
come up as to the expense of such an
office; but the bill will not likely pro s
vide for more than $2,000 or $2,500 for J
' the expense of the office. This is a e
' mere bagatelle compared to the good
! the state would derive from it in having
a desirable addition to its citizenship,
which would materially develop '
her resources.
