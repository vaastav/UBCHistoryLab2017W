TO INCREASE THE NAVY
Secretary Lanmnt Prefers That
Plan to Building Dry Docks.
SOME ARE NEARLY COMPLETE
We Now Have a Total of Twenty Ar*
mored and Forty-Two L narnfored
Vessels.
Washington. Dec. 1.—The annual re
port of the secretary of the navy is a
very exhaustive document of 30,000
words, with numerous tables,
reciting the fact of the completion and
commissioning of the new warships
Olympia, Minneapolis and Indiana,
built by contract, and the Maine, Tex
as and Amphitrite. built at the govern
ment navy yards, the secretary calls
attention to the failure of the ram Ka
tahdin to make the rate of speed named
In the contract for her construction,
and refers the matter to congress. He
says the department expects the Terror
and Monadnock to be in commission
■(February 1, 1896. and tne Puritan about
iluly 1, 1896.
I The secretary pays a high compliment
to the excellency of constiuction of the
^iew vessels.
1 Of the vessels now in the course of
construction he predicts the first-class
battleship Iowa will be completed about
October, 1897. The first-class battle
ship Massachusetts is practically com
pleted except as regards armor. The
first-class battleship Oregon is as far
advanced as is practicable before the
delivery of armor and gan mounts. The
Brooklyn will not be ready for trial in
less than one year.
The report says that l>y June 1, "196,
the government will have docks on the
Atlantic coast—at Port Royal, S. C., and
at Brooklyn—large enough for docking
tpe largest vessels, but recommends
that another be built at Norfolk and
one on the Gulf of Mexico. For the
Pacific coast, the opinion is expressed
that the dock now being bullion Puget
sojind is sufficient for the near future.
In I this connection the secretary says:
Ih my opinion it would be wise to in
vest whatever moneys arc to be expend
upon the navy, beyond its current
neéds and necessities of existing repair
plants, in the construction of new ships
and not in building docks."
ojhe report shows that the United
States has in service: Of the armored
class, three battleships, 16 coast defense
vessels, one cruiser; and of the unar
mored, 13 protected cruisers, 20 un ro
tected cruisers, eight gunboats, one
dyn; smite cruiser and two torpedo boats
—making a total of 20 armored and 42
unajrmoied vessels, exclusive of torpedo
boats. There are now authorized pnd
building five battleships, four coast ie
fense vessels, one cruiser, all armored;
nine unarmored gunboats and seven
torp|edo boats.
The present status of the principal
foreign navies is shown in tables, giv
ing the number of vessels, armored or
unarmored, by classes, in service, or
authorized or building.
The secretary urges legislation touch
ing the personnel of the navy, saying:
"To preorganize the line of the navy so
as td bring about the promotion of offi
cers to the command rank at an age
whed still young enough to learn and
vigorous enough to be self-assertive
Would seem to be all-important. The
majority of our officers now approach
ing the command rank are over 50
years of age. These officers come now
first linto command at a period of life
when the habit of relying on others has
become a second nature.
Thel secretary recommends that the
age of admission to the naval academy
be rec
lnstea
Considerable space is devoted to the
recently established naval war college,
which the secretary regards as a very
Important institution, as putting be
fore tpe officers of the navy practical
questions of actual war to be solved,
thus versing them in the principles of
etrategry and tactics.
TheTeport says: "The increasing in
terest in the naval militia movement in
the lake and seaboard states gives such

)
promise that the department recom
mends that steps now be taken to es
tablish this arm of the national defense
on a definite footing*
Active steps are being taken by
the department toward securing uni
formity in the methods of organization
and in the character of duty performed,
in order that the militia and regular
navy may co-operate effectively and
helpfully in any scheme of national de
fense.
The recommendation of last year is
renewed that the work of coast and
geodetic survey be transferred, a part
to the hydrographic office of the navy
department and the rest to the geologi
cal survey of the interior department.
The estimates of expenses for the
year 1896 are given as follows: For
running expenses $17,692,704, increase of
navy $13,259,292. This is about $1,160,
000 more than the appropriation. For
1897 the estimates are: For running ex
penses $19,672,783, increase of navy
$9,638,383.
In conclusion the secretary says: "An
inspection of the tables given, showing
the relative strength of the navies of
the world, will furnish, it is believed
all argument needed for the continua
tion of the building program hereto
fore indicated by the action of congress.
We are lamentably deficient in torpedo
boats and we certainly need more bat
tleships. The lessons taught at Yalu
and Wei-Hai-Wei have tended to con
firm the belief of naval experts
throughout the world in the efficacy of
these two classes of vessels.
I respectfully recommend the con
struction of two battleships and at
least 12 torpedo boats.

VANDAL'S WORK WAS NOT SERIOUS
Destroyed a Bill, but the Supreme Court
Fixed the Matter.
Boise, Dec. 8.—An interesting discov
ery has been made in relation to a meas
ure passed at the last session of the legis
lature. It was resolved to amend the elec
tion law so that a name could not be
printed twice on the ticket. The populists
, , . . . . _. .
and democrats had in several districts in |
189$ and on presidential electors in 1892 '
printed the names of fusion candidates
oth as democrats and as populists. The
ill to prevent this was agreed upon and
introduced from the committee on elec
tions as a substitute for a pending meas
ure. It laid in a pigeon hole for a long
time, during the senatorial contest, but
was finally called up and passed. Now
it is found that some one while the bill
was laid up, drew a pen through the
clause and the anti-fusion legislation is
consequently not on the statute books.
A case involving the legality of the
practice is now before the supreme court
from Bannock county and there is conse
quently much interest in it. It is the
court's ruling that the names can not
be printed more than once, and the clever
work on the bill will not accomplish the
purpose intended.
WATTERSON ON THE MESSAGE
If Republicans Are Wise They Will Pass
Appropriations Rill and Go Home*
Omaha, Dec. 4.—Hon. Henry Watterson
is in Omaha today. Speaking of the pres
ident's message he said: "Nothing will
come of it. Congress will not do anything
at all, and if the republicans are wise
they will sirfiply pass the appropriations
bill and go home. With different political
majorities in the two houses and Cleve
land in the presidency, it is idle to hope for
any agreement upon important measures
of legislation. It must be remembered
that our national banking system rests
upon the national debt and that if the
national debt is wiped out we will wipe
the whole national banking system with
it. That is one of the best banking sys
tems in the world and ought to be main
tained.

New York, Dec. 4.—The World today
says: "The portions of President Cleve

that the president's views on thé Cuban

Denver, Idaho, Dec. 2.—Camas prairie
residents and the settlers on the reserve
are strongly agitating the completion of
the grade and the building of a bridge
across Lawyer's canyon. The grading was
started but never completed, and until it
is complete it will be a hard matter for
teamsters to haul heavy loads from one
side of the canyon to the. other. The grade
is almost impossible.
The new town of Idona now exists only
in the minds of the original promoters,
but Nez Perce City is making good prog

weather it has been experiencing. There
are about a dozen buildings now being
constructed and a few are already occu
pied. The good farming land which has
not yet been taken up is in remote dis

The work of improving is rapidly going
on and now nearly every claim has a
house either started or completed.

A GREAT FI RE IN INDIANAPOLIS
Property Valued at Half a Million in
the Business District Destroyed. 1
Indianapolis, Dec. 3.—Fire in the heart
of the wholesale district destroyed
proiw
erty valued at half a million in the norths
east quarter of the block bounded by
Meridan, Maryland, Georgia and Illinois
streets, was laid in ruins. Seven or eight
great business establishments were burn,
ed out. The fire began in the wholesale
grocery store of Schnell & Co., at 8;3 q
T he third floor of the building fell h
and the heavy stock piled on it was carried
to the first floor. Flames at once broke
out and the fire spread in all directions.
The employes got out without serious ini
jury, though some had narrow escapes.
Before the department arrived, the entire
block was doomed. Great clouds of black
smoke were pouring out of every window
and by the time the water was turned on
the whole interior was ablaze. There was
much inflammable matter in the stock.
There was an insufficient supply of water
and the weather was bitter cold. The
second and third alarms were turned in
and in 20 minutes after the floor fell, all
the available men and apparatus in the
department were engaged in fighting the
fire. Ten streams of water that were
turned on the burning building from the
front and rear did not seem to have any
effect on the fire, which passed to the
building adjoining on the south occupied
by Fairbanks, Morse & Co. The water
poured on Fairbanks, Morse & Co.'s
building did not have any effect against
the strong wind blowing from the north
and soon after 9 o'clock the last business
house between the fire and alley that was
occupied by Ward Bros., wholesale drug
gists, took fire.
At noon, when the fire had been placed
under control, though fiercely burning, the
burned territory extended from No. 62 to
74. The following firms were burned out:
Schnull & Co., wholesale grocers; Ward
Bros., druggists; Fairbanks & Morse,
scales; Eckhouse Bros., liquors; Indiana
Coffee Co.; Woodford & Pohlman, liq
uors; Hildebrand Hardware Co. The build
ings were all brick, three and four stories
in height. Several firemen were carried
down by the falling walls. It is believed
two who have been taken to the hospital
will die.
The fire caused practically a total loss
on the buildings and stocks. The owners
estimate the losses on the stock as fol
lows: Hildebrand Company, $80,000, there
will be some salvage; Joseph and Moses
Eckhouse, $11,000; Woodford & Pohlman,
$26,000; Schnull & Co., $125,000; Fairbanks
Scale Co., $15,000; Ward Bros., $35,000; In
diana Coffee Co., $60,000. The estimated
total value of the stock destroyed was
$372,000, which, together with the build
ings, will reach $600,000: There is about
$300,000 insurance.
