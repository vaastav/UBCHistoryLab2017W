SYNOPSIS OF THE PRESIDENT'S
MESSAGE. " ' " '
By Telegraph.
" The President 'says" the correspondence
touching foreign; affairs fvhich has taken
place during the last year is herewith sub
mitted , in compliance with the request to
that effect. ' If the condition -of our rela
tion with other nations is less gratifying
than formerly, it is certainly more satisfac
tory than a nation so unhappily distracted
miaht have reasonably aonrohended. A
blockade of three thousand miles ' of sea
coast could not be established and vigorously
enforced jn a season of great commercial
activity like the present, without commit
ting occasional mistakes and inflicting
unintentional injuries upon foreign netions
and subjects. In clear cases of these kinds,
I have as far aspossiblo heard and redres
sed the complaints by friendly powers.
There is, however a large and augmenting
nnrober of doubtful coses upon which the
Government is unable to agree with the
Governments whoso protection is demanded
by t lio claimants.
"There are more cases in which the Uni
ted States or their citizens suffer wrongs
from the naval or military authorities of
foreign nations, which tho Government of
these States are not at once prepared to re
dress. I have proposed to some of the for
eign States, interested, mutual conventions,
to examine and adjust puch complaints.
This has been made especially to Great
Britain, Franca, Spain and Prussia. In each
case it has been favorably received; but not
yet formally adopted.
Applications have been made to me by
manv free Americans of African descent to
wij5ie on tho other hand several
' Spanish American Republics have
of the
rrotes-
: ted against the sending of such colonies to
i their respective territories. Under these
circum.-tar.ces, I have declined to move any
such coiony to any State without first ob
taining the consent of its Government, with
an agreement on its part to receive and pro
tect such emigrants in all their rights a free
men, and I have at the same time offered to
the several btates situated in the tropics, or
having colonies there, to negotiate with withstanding this y lan, the recommendation
them, subject to the advice and consent of : that Cot gross rovido by law for compeii-at-the

I regret to say that such persons contempla
ting colonization do not seem so willing to
emigrate to these countries as to some oth
ers, nor willing as I think their interest de
mands. I believe, however, that tho opin
ion is improving, and that ere lorg there will
be an augmented and considerable emigra
tion to both these countries.
Our relations with European States re
main undisturbed, and with States of our
continent have improved, especially Mexi
co, Costa liico, &c. .
The President speaks of a fayored proj
ect, the Atlantic Telegraph, and of exten
ding the Pacific line to connect with that
being extended across the Russian Empire;
thinks the mineral resources of the territo-
ries ought to bo developed as rapidly aspos-
slbie. Every step in that diraction would
have a tendency to improve tho revenues.
UDited States not p3Vable in coin and
sufficiently largo for the wants of the peo
ple, can be permanently, usefully and safely
maintained.
Is there any other mode in which the
necessary provision Tor tne public wants can
be made, and the great advantages of a safe !
and uniform currency secured. I know ofi
none which pronvses so certain results, and
at the same time so unobjectionable as the
organization of banking associations under t bo received by that body. Of course
a general act of Congress, well guarded in it be vehemently opposed" by tho cou ti
lts provisions. To such associations tho Gov-I try banks, and as they exercise a powerful

Secretary of the Treasury's report. He re- j
fers to the reports of the Secretary of the
Navy and War, and says, though lengthy,
there are ouly brief abstracts. He says
there is a decided improvement in the finan
cial condition of the Post-office Department,
compared with tbe preceding year. The
Secretary of the Interior reports that the
public lands have ceased to be a source of
revenue.
Speaking.of Indian affairs, and the recent
troubles, he says: I submit for your special
consideration whether our Indian, system
shall not be remodeled lie 'urges the ear-
liest completion of the Pacific Railroad, and
' also the iavorable action of ConsresBOU the
projects for enlarging the great canals of
New York, Iilinois and Michigan.
The President refers to his compensated
emancipation proclamation o f September 22,
and says that portion of the earth occupied
by the people of the United . States is well
adapted to the home of one national family,
but not for two or more. In the Inaugural
Address I briefly poiuted out the total inad
equacy oi disunion as a remedy for differ
ences between tho people of the two sec
tions. I did so in language which I can not
soperate; we can not remove our respective
sections from each other' nor build an im
passable wall between them, lie remarked
at length on the difficulty of making any
u&Uonal boundary line.
The President then suggests amendments
to tho Constitution, Congress concurring, to
be proposed to tho Legislatures or Conven
tions of the several States, which, if ratified
by three-fourths of said Legislatures, to bo
valid as parts of said Constitution.
The first article proposes that all States
abolishing slavery before January 1, 1900.
j shall receive compensation from tho Uuited
States.
2. All si aves freed bv the chances of war,
any time before the end of tho rebellion,
shall bo forever free; but all owners who had
not been disloyal shall bo compensated.
3. Congress may appropriate money, and
otherwise provide for colonizing free colored
persons, with their conseut, at any place
without the United States.
The President discusses these articles at
some length, and asks if, then, for a com
mon object, slave property is to be sacrificed?
Is it not just that it be done at a common
charge? And if with less money, or money
more easily paid, we can preserve the bene
fits of the Union by this means that we can
bv the war alone, is it not economical to do
it?
The proposed emancipation would shorten
i this
war. perpetuate peace, lnsnra an m-
j rrease in population, aud, proportionately,
' won't Ti .f t in nun i i rt
The President then says the plan, consist-
ing of these articles, is recommendul not
v - - wvMuv"v
but that a restoration of tho National aulhor-
ity would he ccceptcd without its adoption;
nor will tho war or proceedings under the
proclamation of September 22 be stayed, be
cause c.fthe recommendation of this plan.
Its timely adoption 1 doubt not would bring
; restoration and thereby stay both; and, not-
upon, is hereby earnestly renewed.
j i nis plan is recommendeii as a means
j not in conclusion of, but additional to all
others for restoring and preserving the Na
tional authority throughout the Union. TIio
subject is presented exclusively in its eco
nomical asppct. Tho plan is proposed as a
permanent Constitutional law. In conclu
sion the President says: The dogmas of
tho q-iietpast are inadequate to the stormy
present. The occasion is piled high with
difUculty, and we must rise with the occa
sion. The firry trial through which wc pass
will light us down in honor or dishouer to
the latest generation.
We say that we are for the Ucion. The
world will not forgot that while wo say this
we do know how to save the Union. Iu

A Plan t3 Ureal, Down Stan- Stocks and
Depreciate them in Value
It is now definitely understood that Mr.
Chase, in his forthcoming financial report,
will strongly urge the adoption of the na
tional system of freo banking he so earnestly
recommended at tho last session of Congress.
This project is practically similar to the
banking law now in operation in this State.
It provides tht t any chartered Slato 15 ink,
of not less thuii 100,000 capital, mav issue
currency based on deposits of the United
States stock. The notes, of not less than
fivo dollars nor mote than five thousand, are
to be furnished by the Government, and arc
to be reeeivabln at par in all paris of the
United States for all Government dues ex
cept customs. So as to make room for this
Government currency, tho scheme contem
plates, further, a tax of two per cent, on all
bank issues, other than those secured by
United States stock. Stringent penalties an;
provided tor any evasion ot tins tax, which
Mr. Chase believes will eventually drive out
the State Bank issues.
Such, in brief, is the scheme which is to.
ke submitted to Congress as the panacea for
onr currency troubles. It is to be seen how
that of the business community, will bo from ;
other and more serious considerations. j
Mr. Chase's schemes, stripped of all ver-
biago, is that some $200,000,000 of State
stocks, now hold by banks as a security for i
- v.. j'ww

Mr. Chase's scheme would require a long pe
nod before it could be put into operation
without seriously injuring the business of
the country. Oa the whole," we think its
chances not very -good. ,

There is a great varioty of opinions as to
the ago of the world; the Science of Geology
and the discoveries of learned men contra
dict the Mosaic account of its pge,': and de
monstrate that it is more than six thousand
years old. If man entertains and exercises
a laudable and proper cariosity to ascertain
the true history of the earth upon which we
dwell and oyer which God hath given him
dominion, it should not be deemed strange
that be should also entertain a deep In
terest in ' and desire to know the history of
himself and ' his race, to whom hath been
assigned too whole earth as a place not of
probatiou alone, but alsoof developement of
all those wonderful faculties and powers,
tho. possession of which, have caused it to
be said of him "that he has been made but
littlo lower than the angels."
Curiosity is tho fruitful mother of dis
cover', of questions and of aoswers;even the
illiterate nroriound queries touching our
origin aud the startling and marked variety j
of ourspecies which confound science,philo-
I sophy and history. A child came into the t
! study of a philosopher, who was pondering
over his books and committing his specula
tions and theories to paper, to enlighten
mankind, and asked him. for some fire; "you
nro welcome to it," said he, "but you have
nothing in which to carry it." Tho child filled
its littlo hand with cold ashes, laid a live
coal upon it and went cut; tho wiso man
was amused and instructed; he had been
taught by the simplicity of childhood. So

A Goon Suggestion. The New York

l. in i .t r ..
luu uiiiiuiuer oi commerce, tho Church cs, '
&c.,to contribute especially on Ti a iksgiv- i
ing Day a fund for the relief of the starv- !
ing operatives in England, deprived of em-i
fdoymant iu consequenca of tho rebellion!
cutting off the usual supply of cotton. The t
New York Erpress coairnenls upon this
properly as follows:
These Abolition editors, it strikes us,
have compa-sion for everybody save tho
white laboring men, and the whi'e laboring
men's families, here in the North. Just now'
when the mechanic and day-laborer find it
next to impossible to make" both ends meet,
owing to the 'war prices' Abolitionism and
Secessionism have brought upon us, they are
penning numtreds of thousands of dollars
on lazy, fat and sleek contrabands. South i
... . i ie peop ,e are next to Oe called upon to I
Jielp feed and clothe the paupers of other
lands! H ith coal at eiht to nine dolUra a
t""! flour ten dollars per birrel. aud t:i and i
M"S ' every description enormously
high now is the time for charitv tn !;".. i
at home. By all means, let us have a gen
erous contribution on Thanksgiving Day all
around, but let tho proceeds be devoted to
the poor families of our soldiers, who are
fighting tbe battles of the Union. Let us
be just before we are generous.'
A woman offering to sign a deed, the

the lady; 'no, nor twenty like him.'
