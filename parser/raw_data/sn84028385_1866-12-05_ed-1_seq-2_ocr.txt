The Message.
- We received the Annual Message o f
the President but a few hours before
our usual time of closing our inside
forms, but noticing that it was not the
liveliest document that had ever ema
nated from the White House, concluded
we had better give it to our readers this
week, as a week's delay would proba
bJynot impart any animation to the
prosy production. A number of arti
cles intended for this issue have been
crowded out. '
We reserve comments upon the lies,
sage for a more opportune time.
Mr. Tilton's Lecture.
The lecture of Mr. Tilton, Friday
evening last, on the " Corner Scone of
Reconstruction," was one of the best
ever heard in this place. Those who
missed it sustained an irreparable loea,
while those who had the pleasure of
hearing it enjoyed one of the highest
intellectual treats. We have no doubt
that Mr. Tilton is doing much good in
the cause of equal rights, and trust he
may leave as sound and lasting impres
sions elsewhere as he did here. He is
an earnest, ardent, eloquent speaker,
animating his theme with " thought
that breathe and words that burn."
Eschewing the manuscript reading
" style of ordinary lecturers, and, we may
" add, never writing out a lecture, Mr.
Tilton speaks with an ease, freedom,
eloquence and fervor that captivates
and draws his audience into full sym
pathy with him.
We regret that want of space pre
cludes our noting some of the very fine
and more important points 'of the lec-
ture. JUT. lllton is an auvocam uj iiu.

Amendment, but insists on the right
of the blacks to the ballot. ; Universal
Suffrage he regaids as Utopian; a thing
impossible for the present. Impartial
Suffrage was the corner-stone of dura
ble reconstruction.
Wa notice that the Pittsburgh Com
mercial, commenting on the position Mr.
Tilton occupies toward the Constitu-
difficult person to nnaersiana mat
when th8 Amendment was passed thro'

Congress, he endorsed and lauded it. r
The Commercial is mistaken. Mr. T1"
ton never approved of the Amend
ment, and bis present position is en
tirely consistent with his past.
A Strong Point.
Mr. Tilton, in his lecture, denied the
right of Congress to submit the Constitu
tional Amendment to the late rebel States,
as he also denied the'right of those States
to ratify an Amendment to the Constitu
tion; because if Congress concedes that
they are entitled to a voice and vote .in so
important a matter as amending the Con
stitutor!, which is the supreme law of the
land, ihtf consistently, be depri
ved the lesser privilege of participation in
the more ordinary business of Congress-
ional legislation. ,. In conceding they have
the higher and vastly more -important
Tight, the inferior right is necessarily Im

the loyal States, who were the life of the
Government during the rebellion, and
who are as much so now as then, is tbe
' only party who has the right to say upon
what terms the conquered rebel States
shall be permitted to re-enter the Union.
Mr. Tilton is on the right track. - Con-

Message of the President of the United
Message of the President of the United States to the two Houses of Congress
at the Commencement of the Second
Session.
Fcllmpcitken of the tScnaf and House of
Jlrprescntatives :
INTRODUCTION.
After a brief interval the Congress of
the United Stales resumes its legisla
tive labors. An all-wise and merciful
Providence has abated the pestilence
which visited our shores,, leaving iti
calamitous traces upon some portions
of our country. Pt-ice, order, tran
quility, and civil au Jiority have been
formally declared to exist throughout
the whole of the United States. In
all of these States civil authority has
superseded the co-er.-ion of arms, and
the people, by their voluntary action,
are maintaining their goyernments in
full activity and complete operation.
The enforcement of (he laws is no Ion
ger "obstructed in any State by combi
nations too powerful to be suppressed
by the ordinary course of judicial pro
ceeding: and the animosities engen
dered by the war are rapidly yielding
to the benificent influences of our free
institutions, and to taetindly effects
of unrestricted social and commercial
intercourse.' An enure restoration of
fraternal feeling must be the earnest
wish of every patriot ic heart ; and we
will have accomplished our grandest
national achievement when, forgetting
the sad events of the past, and remem
bering only . their instructive lessons,
we resume our onwai I career as a free,
prosperous people.
CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY.
,
In my . message of the 4th of De
cember, ISG5, Congiess was informed
of the measure which had been insti
tuted by the Executive with a view to
the gradual restoration of the States in
which the insurrection was to their rela
tions with the General Government.
Provisional Governors had been ap
apointed, Contentions called, Govern
ors elected, Legislatures assembled, and
Senators and Representatives chosen
to the Congress of the United States.
Courts had been opened for the en
forcement of laws long in abeyance.
The blockade had -been removed-, custom-house
re established, and the inter
nal revenue laws put in force, in order
that the people miht contribute to
the national income. Postal operations
had been renewed, aud efforts were be
ing made to restore them to their for
mer condition of efficiency. The States
themselves had been asked to' take

as one of the legitimate results of our
internecine struggle.
ADMISSION OF CONGRESSMEN FROM THE
REBEL STATES.
,
Having progressed thus far, the Ex
ecutive Department found that it had
accomplished nearly all that was within
the scope of its constitutional authori
ty. One thing, however, yet remained
to be done before the work of restora
tion could be completed, and that was
the admission to Cocgress of loyal Sena
tors and Representatives from the
States whose peot ie had rebelled
B?smbb lilts ittmu i

G neraJ Governmefl. This question
devolved -upon the respective Houses,
which, bv the Constitution, are made
the iudces of the elecaons, returns and
nualifieations ot the:r own members;
and its consideration at once engaged
the attention of Congress.
ACTION OF THE EXECUTIVE.
In the meantime, the Executive partmentno
other plan having been
proposed by Congrtss continued its
efforts to perfect, as f. r as was practica
ble, the restoration of the proper rela
tions between the citizens of -the res
pective States, the : States, and the
Federal Government, extending, from
time to time, as the public interest
seemed to require, the judicial, revenue
anA uncial svfctem of the country.
With the advice and consent of the
Senate, the necessary officers were ap
imil. and aDcroDriations made by
I Congress for the payment of their sala
j ries. The proposition to amend the
Federal Constitution, so as to prevent
the existence of sh very within the
United States or any place subject to
their jurisdiction, wrs ratified by the
requisite number of States; and on
the 18th day of Dece mber, 1805, it was
officially declared to have become valid
as a part of the Constitution of the
United States. All the States in which
the insurrection had existed promptly
amended their Constitution, so as to
maxethem conform lo the great change
thus effected in tbe rganic law of the
land ;" declared null tud void all ordi
nances and laws of secession; repudia
ted all cretended deb s and obligations
created for the revolutionary purposes
of the insurrection ; aud proceeded, in
good faith, to the er. .ctment of meas
ures for the protection and ameliora
tion of the condition of the colored
race. Congress, however, yet hesita
ted to admft any cl these blates to
representation ; and it was not until
towards the close oi uie eigum moum
of the session that . h exception was
made in favor of Tennessee, by the
admission of her SeV tors and Repre
sentatives.

the existence of the tetates was terrain-:
ated by the - rebellious act of their
and that the insurrection
having been guppr.iised, they were
thenceforward to be considered merely
as conquered territoi ies. The Legisla
tive. Executive and Judicial Depart
ments of the Goverrment have, how
ever, with great diet rnctness and uni
form consistency, rr'used to 'sanction
an assumption so incompatible with
the nature of our r publican system,
'and with the profesd objects of
war. Throughout the recent legisla
tion of CoDgress, the undeniable
makes itself apparent , that these
political communiiu are nothing
than States of this Union. At
very commencement of the rebellion,'
each House declared, with a unanimi
ty as remarkable as it was significant,
that the war was not "waged, upon
part, in any spirit of oppression,
for auy purpose of conquest or subju
tion, nor purpose of oyerthrowing

interfering with the rights or eetab?
lished institutions of those States, but
to defend and maintain the supremacy
of the Constitution and all laws
made in pursuance thereof, and to pre
serve the Union with all the dignity,
equality, and rights of the several
States unimpaired ; and that as soon
as these objects" were "accomplished,
the war ought to cease." In sosie in
stances, Senators were were permitted
to continue their legislative functions,
while in other instances, Representa
tives, were elected and admitted to
seats after their States had formally
declared their right to withdraw from
the Union, and were endeavoring to
maintain that right by force of arms.
All of the States whose people were in
insurrection, as States, were included
in the apportionment of the direct tax
of twenty millions of dollars annually
laid upon the United States by the act
approved 5th August, 1861. Congress,
by the act of March 4, 1862, and by
the apportionment of representation
thereunder, also recognized their pres
ence as States in the Union ; and they
have, for judicial purposes, been. divi.
ded into districts, as States alone can
be divided. Tbe same recognition ap
pears in the recent legislation in refer
ence to Tennessee, which evidently
rests upon the fact that the functions of
the State were not 'destroyed by the re
bellion, but merely suspended ; and
that principle is of course applicable to
those States which, like Tennessee, at
tempted to renounce their places in the
Union.
The action of the Executive Depart
meat of the Government upon this
subject has been equally definite and
uniform, and the purpose of the war
was specifically stated in the Procla
mation issued by my predecessor on
the 23d day of September, 18G2. It
was then solemnly proclaimed and de
clared, that "hereafter, as heretofore,
the war will be prosecuted for the ob
ject of practically restoring the consti
tutional relation between the United
States and each of the States and peo
ple thereof, in which States that rela
tion is or may be suspended or disturb
ed." The recognition of the States by the
Judicial Department of the Govern
ment has also been clear and conclu
sive in all proceedings affecting them
as Sutes, had in the Supreme, Circuit
and District Courts.
NO DISLOYAL MEMBERS WILL BE ADMITTED.
:
In the admission of Senators and
Representatives from any or all of the
States, there can be no just ground of
apprehension that persons who are dis
loyal will be clothed with the power of
legislation ; for this could not happen
when the Constitution and laws are en
forced by a vigilant and faithful Con
gress. Each House is made the 'judge
of the elections, returns, and qualifica
tions of its own members," and may,
"with a concurrence of two-thirds, ex
pel a member." When a Senator or
Representative presents his certificate
of election, he may at once be admit
ed or rejected ; or, should there be any
question to his eligibility, his credent
ials may be referred to for investiga
tion for the appropriate committe. If
admitted to a seat, it must be upon ev
idence satisfactory to the House of
which he thus becomes a member, that
j.he possesses the requisite constitution
al and legal quaimcaiions. ii reruseu
admission as a member for want of due
allegiance to the Government, aod re-
turned to his constituents, they are
admonished that none but persons loy
al to the United States will be allowed
a voice in the Legislative Councils of
the Nation, and the political power and
moral influence of Congress, are thus
effectively exerted in the interests of
loyalty to the Government and fidelity
to the Union. Upon this question so
vitally affecting the restoration of the
Union and the permanency of. our
present form of government, my con
victions heretofore expressed, have un
dergoue no change ; but, on the. con
trary, their correctness has been con
firmed by reflection ana ame.. ii me
admission of loyal members to seats in
the respective Houses of Congress was
wise and expedient a year ago, it is no
less wise and expedient now. If this
anomalous condition" is right now if,
in the exact condition of these States
at the present time, it is lawful to ex
clude them from representation, I do
not see that the question will bechang
ed by the efflux of time. Ten years
hence, if these States remain as they
are, the right of representation will be
no stronger the right of exclusion
will be no weaker.

The war having terminated, and with it

and forcibly urged that our Government
is not to be maintained nor our Union
preserved "by invasions of the rights and
powers of the several States. : In t r. at
tempting to make our Gmeral Go. '-n-ment
strong, we make it weak. Its true
strength consists in leaving individuals
and States as much as possible to themselves;
in milking itself felt, not in its power, but
in its benefioence ; not in its control, but
in its protection; cot in binding the States
more closely to the centre, but leaving
each to move unobstructed in its proper
constitutional orbit" These are the teach
ings of men whose deeds and services have
made them illustrious, and who, long since
withdrawn from the scenes of lifo, have
left to their country the rich legacy of
their example, .their wisdom and their
patriotism. Drawing fresh inspiration
from their lessons, let us emulate them in
love of country and respect for the Con

REPORT SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.
TRY.
The report of the Secretary of the Treas
ury affords much information respecting
the revenue and commerce of the country.
His views upon the currency, and with
reference to a proper adjustment of our
revenue system, internal as well as im
post, are commended to the careful con
sideration of Congress. In my lost annual
message I expressed my general views
upon these subjocts. I need now only call
attention te the necessity of carrying into
every department of the government a
system of rigid accountability, thorough
retrenchment, and wise econemy. With
no exceptional nor unusual, expenditures,
the oppressive burdens of taxation can be
lessened by such a modification of our rev
enue laws as will be consistent with the
public faith, and the legitimate and neces
sary wants of the government.
" The report presents a much moro satis
factory condition of our finances than one
year ago the most sanguine could have
anticipated. During the fiscal year end
ing the 30th of June, 1865, the last year of
the war, the public debt was increased
$941,902,537, and on the 31st of October,
1863, it amounted to $2,740,854,750. On
the 81st day of October, 1866, it had been
reduced to $2,551,310,006, the diminution,
during a period of fourteen months, com
mencing September 1, 1865, and ending
October 31, 1866, having been $206,379,
565. In the last annual report on the
stale of the finances, it was estimated that
during the three quarters of the fiscal year
ending the 30th of June last, the debt
would be increased $112,194,947. During
that period, hewever, it was reduced $31,
196,387, the receipts of the year having
been $89,905,905 more, and the expendi
tures $200,529,235 less than tbe estimates.
Nothing could more clearly indicate than
these statements the extent and availabili
ty of the national resources, and the rapid
ity and safety with which, under our form
of government, great military and naval
establishments can be disbanded, and ex
penses reduced from a war to a peace foot
ing. ' '
During the fiscal year ending the 30th
of June, 1866, the receipts were $558,032,
620, and the expenditures $520,750,940,
leaviDg an available surplus of $37,281,
680. It is estimated that the receipts for
the fiscal year ending the 30th of June,
1867, will be $475,001,386, and that the
expenditures will reach the sum of $316,
428,078, leaving in the Treasury a surplus
of $158,633,308. For the fiscal year end
ing June 30. 1808, it is estimated that the
receipts will amount to $436,000,000, and
that the expenditures will be $350,247,64l
showing an' excess of $85,752,359 in
favor of the Government. These estima
tor! rweinta mav be diminished by a re
duction of excise and import duties ; but
after, all necessary reductions shall have
heen'made. the revenue of the present and
of following years will doubtless be suffi
cient to cover all legitimate charges upon
the Treasurv. ' and leave a lanre annual
surplus to be applied to the payment of
tn principal oi tne ueou mere scum
now to be no good reason why taxes may
not be reduced as the country advances in
nonnlation and wealth, and yet the debt
be extinguished within the next quarter of
a century.

ment for the year ending June SO, 1866,
were $14,886,986, and the expenditures
$15,852,079, showing an excess-of the lat
ter of $965,093. In anticipation of this
deficiency, however, a special appropria
tion was made by Congress in the act ap
proved July 28, 1866. Including the
standing appropriation of $700,000 for free
mail matter, as a legitimate portion of the
revenues yet remaining unexpended, the
actual deficiency for the past year is only
$265,093 a sum within $51,141 of the
amount estimated in the annual report
1864. The decrease of revenue compared
with the previous year was one and one
fifth per cent, and the increase of expend
itures, owing principally to the enlarge
ment of the mail service in the South, was

there were in operation six thousand nine

aggregate length of one hundred and
eighty thousand nine hundrod and twen
ty-one miles, an asrfcregate annual trans
portation of seventy one million eight

portation three million four hundred and

increasing throughout the whole country,
and its steady extension in the Southern
States indicates their constantly improv
ing condition. The growing importanco
of the foreign service also merits attention.
The Postoffiee Depa tment of Great Brit
ain and our own have agreed upon a pre
limary basis for a new Postal Convention,
which it is believed will grove eminently
beneficial to the commercial interests of
the United Suites, inasmuch as it con
templates a reduction of postage with all
countries to and from which correspond
ence is transmitted in the British mails or
in closed mails through the United King

of correspondence, either in open or closed

REPORT THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.
The renort of the Secretary of the Inte
rior exhibits the condition of those bran
ches of the publje service which are com
mitted to his supervision. During the
last fiscal year, four million six hundred
and twentv-nina thousand three hundred
and twelve acre public land were dispos
ed of, one million eight hundred and
ninety-two thousand five hundred and
sixteen acres of which were entered, un
der the homestead act The policy ong-
inallv adorjted relative to the public lands
has undergone essential modifications.
Immediate revenue, and not their rapid
settlement, was tho cardinal feature of our
land system. Long experience and ear
nest discussion have resulted in mo tuu
virtinn that the earlv development of our
agricultural resources, and the diffusion
of an energetic population over our vast
territory, are objects of far greater impor
tance to the national growth and prosper
ity than the proceeds of the sale of the
land to the highest bidder in open mar
ket. The preemption laws confer upon
the pioneer who complies with' the terms
they impose the privilege of purchasing
a limited nortion of "unoffered lands" at
tho minimum price. Thnhomestead en act-
menu relieve the settler from the pay
ment of purchase money, and secure him
a permanent homo, upon the condition of
residence tor a term ot years, auis uuer
al tiolicv invites emigration from the old,
and from the more crowded portions of
the new world. Its propitious Jesuits are
undoubted, and will be more signally
manifested when time shall have given it
a wider development. .
INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS.
Congress has made liberal grants of pub
lic land to corporations, in aid of the con
structions of railroads and other internal
improvements. Should this policy here
after prevail, more stringent provisions
will be required to secure a faithful appli
cation of the fund. The title of the lands
should not pass, by patent or otherwise,
but remain in the hands of the Govern
ment and subject to its control until some
portion of the road has actually been built.
Portions of them might then, from time
to time, be conveyed to the corporation,
but never in a greater ratio to the whole
quantity embraced by the grant, than the
completed parts bear to the entire length
nf tha nroiected improvement. This re
striction would not operate to the preju
dice of any undertaking conceived in good
faith ana execuiea wua reasuuuun; ;
gy, as it is the settled practice to withdraw
from market the lands falling within the
opperation of such grants, and thus to ex
clude the inception ef a subsequent ad
verse right. A breach of the conditions
which Congress may deem proper to im
pose should work a forfeiture of -:lam to
tho lands so withdrawn but conveyed,
and of title to tho landi conveyed which
remain unsold.
Operations on tho several lines of the
Pacific Kailroad have been prosecuted
with unexampled vigor, and success.
Should no unforseen causes of delay occur,
it is confidently anticipated that this
great thoroughfare will be completed be
fore the expiration of the period designa
ted by Congress. ' "
PENSIONS.
During the last fiscal year the amount
paid to pensioners , including the expen
ses of disbursement, was thirteen million
four hundred and fifty-nine thousand
nine hundred and ninetv-six dollars; and
fifty thousand one hundred and seventy
seven nrftoes were added to the pension
rolls. The entire number of pensioners
June 30, 18C6, wasone hundred and twenty-six
thousand seven hundred and twen
ty two. ' This fact furnishes melancholy
and striking proof of the sacrifice made to
vindicate the constitutional authority of
the Federal Government, and to main
tain inviolate the integrity of the Union.
They impose upon us corresponding obli
gations. It is estimated that thirty-three
million dollars will be required to meet
the exigencies of this branch of the ser
vice during the next fiscal year,

As a subject upon which dependo an
immense amount of - the production
and commerce of the country, I recom
mend to Congress such legislation
as may be necessary for the preserva
tion of the levees of the . Mississippi
river. It is a matter of national im
portance" that early steps should be ta
ken not only to aau to me euicieocy

The District of Columbia, under
existing laws, is not entitled to that
representation in the- National Coun
cils- which, from our earliest history.
has been uniformly accorded to each
Territory established from time to time
within our limits, it maintains pecu
liar relations to Congress, to whom
Constitution has granted the' power
exercisine exclusive legislation over
the seat of government. Our fellow
citizens residing in the District,- whose
interests are .thus confided to the spe
cial guardianship of Congress, exceed
in number the population of several
our Territories, and no. just reason
perceived why a delegate ot tneir
choice should not be admitted ' to
seat in the House of Bepreeentatives.
No-mode, seems so appropriate ': and
effectual of enabling them to make
known their peculiar condition .and
wants, and of securing the local legis
la tion adapted to them. I therefore
recommend the passage of a law au
thorising the electors of the District
of Columbia to choose a delegate, to
allowed the tame rights and privileges

CONGRATULATIONS TO THE CZAR.
The congratulations of Congress to

IMMIGRATION OF FREEDMEN.
The Executive, warned of an attempt
by Spanish American adventurers to
induce the emigration of freedmen of
the United States to a foreign country,
protested against the project aa one
which, if onsumated, would reduce
them to a bondage even more oppres
sive than that from which they have
just been releived. Assurance has been
received Trom the Governor of the
State in which the plan was matured,
that the proceeding will meet neither
its encouragement nor approval. It is
a question worthy of your considera

ject are adequate to the prevention or
punishment of the crime thus meditated.
MEXICAN AFFAIRS.
of
In the month of April last, as Con
gress is aware, a friendly arrangement
was made between the Emperor of
France and the President ol the United
States for the withdrawal from Mexi
co of the French expeditionary mili
tary- forces. This withdrawal was to
be'effected in three detachments, the
first of which, it was understood, would
leave Mexico in November, dot past,
the second in March, next, mid the
third and Ia9t, in November, 1SCG.
Immediately upon tbe completion of
the evacuation, the rrencu bovern-
inent was to assure the same attitude
of non-intervention in regard to Mexi
co, as is held by the Government of
the Unitey States. Kepeated assurances
haye been given by the tmperor, since
that agreement, that he would com
plete the promised evacuation witnin
the period mentioned, or sooner. ;
It was reasonably expected tnai me
proceedings thus contemplated would
produce a crisis oi great political inter
est in the Republic of Mexico, .lue
newly appointed Minister of theUnlted
States, Mr. Campbell, was therefore
sent forward, on the 9th day of No
vember last, to assume his - proper
functions as Minister Plenipotentiary
of the United States to that Republic.
It was also thought expedient that he
should be attended in tbe vicinity of
Mexico by the Lieutenant General of
the Army of the United Slates, with
the view of- obtaining such information
as might Le impcrtapt to determine the
course to be pursued- by - the .United
Slates in establishing and maintaining
necessary and proper intercourse with
the Republic ot Mexico. Leepiy in
terested in the cause of liberty and
humanity it seemed an obvious duty
on our part to exercise whatever iduu
ence we possessed for the restoration
and permanent establishment in that
country of 8domstic and republican
form of governmetrt.
Such was the condition 'of. affairs in
regard to Mexico, when, ou the 23d of
November last, otncnl information was
received from Paris that the Emperor.
of France bed some time - before
decided not to withdraw a detachment
of his forces in the "month of Novem-
bei past, according to engagement, but
that this dci-don wm made with tho
purpose of withdrawing the whole- of
those forces la thn ensuing spring Of
this determination, however, the Uoi
ted State had not received any notice
or intim-'K:on ; .nd bo soon as tne in
formation ras receive! by the Govern
ment, care wan taken to make its dis
sent to the Emperor of France.'
I cannnol - foregoe the hope that
France will rf consider the subject, and
adopt soma resolution in regard to the
evacuation of Mexico which will con
form as nearly a practible with the ex
isting engagement, and meet' the just
expectations of the United "States.
The paper relating lo tne suhject will
be laid before you. It w believed that
with the evacunHan of Mextco by the
expeditionary forces, no subject for se
riom difference between France and
the United States would remain. The
expressions of the Eemperor and peo
ple of r ranee warrant a nope mai ine
traditionary friendship between -- tbe
two countries might in that cse be ie
newed and permanently restored.
INTERNATIOAL INDEMNITY.
A claim of a citizen of the United
States for indemnit "for spoliations
committed on the high seas by - the
French authorities; in the exercise of a
belligerent power against. Mexico, has
been met by the Government of France
with a preposition to dofer' settlement
until a mutual convention for the ad
justment of all claims of citizens and
su Meets of boin c)uitr.tw, arising out
of the recent wars on this continent,
shall be agreed upon by the two coun
tries. - The suggestion h no1 deemed
unreasonable, but it belongs to Con
gress to direct tho manner in which
claims for. indemnity by foreigners, as
well as by ci'iJieris of the United States,
arising out of the late oivil war, shall
be adjudicated and determined. I
haye no doubt that the subject of all
such claims will engage your attention
at a convenient and proper time.

An entire change of ministry occurred
in that country during the last session

at an early day, and there Is some rea

THE FENIANS.
On the Cth of June last, in violation of
our neutrality taws, a military expedition
and enterprise against tbe British Jsorth
American Colonies wa? projected and at
tempted to bo carried on within tho terri
tory and jurisdiction of the United States.
In obedienco to the obligation imposed
upon the Executive by tho Constitution,
to see that the laws are faithfully execu
ted, all citizens were warned, by procla
mation, against taking pari in or aiding
such unlawful proceedings, and the prop
er civil, military and naval officers were
directed to take all necessary measures for
t'ae enforcement of the laws. The expe
dition failed, but it has not been with
out its oainful coneouoncesv Some of our
citizens who, it was alleged, were engaged
in the expedition,- were captured, ana
have been brought to tritl, as for a cap
ital offense in the Province of Canada.
Judgement and sentence of death have
been pronounced against some, while oth
ers have been acquitted. Fully believing in
tho maxim of government, that severity
of civil punishment for miuided persons
who have engaged in revolutionary at
tempts which have disastrously failed, is
unsound and unwise, Jch representations i
have been made to the British tiovern
ment, in behalf of the convicted persons,
as, being sustained by an enlightened and
humane iudgment, will, it ishsped, induce
in their cases au exercise of clemency and
a judicious amnesty to all who were en
gaged iu the movement Counsel has
been employed by the Government to de
fend citizens of the United States on trial
for capital offenses in Canada, and a dis
continuance of the prosecutions which
were instituted in the courts of the Uni
ted ii Lutes against those who took part in
the expedition, has been directed.
I have regarded tho expedition as not
only political in its nature, but as also in
a great measure foreign from the United
Slates in its causes, character, and objects.
The attempt was understood to be made in
sympathy with an insurgent party in Ire
land, and, by striking at a British Prov
ince on this Continent, was designed to
ail in obtaining redress for political griev
ances which, it was assumed, the people
of Ireland had suffered at the hands of
the British Government during a period
of several centuries. ' The persons engag
in it were chiefly natives ot that country,
some of whom had, while others had not,
become citizens of the United States un
der our general'laws of naturalization.
Complaints of misgovernment in Ireland
continually engage the attention of the
British nation, and so great an -agitation
is now prevailing in Ireland that the
British Government have deemed it nec
essary to suspend the of" habeas corpus in
that country. These circumstances must
necessarily njpdify the opinion which we
might otherwise have entertained in re
gard to an expedition expressly prohibited
by our neutrality laws. So long as those
remain upen our statute books, tbey
should be faithfully executed, and if they
operate harshly, unjustly, or oppressively,
Congress alone oan, apply the remedy, by
their modification or repeal.
THE EASTERN QUESTION.
"Political and commercial interests of
the United States -are not unlikely to be
affected in some degree by events which
are transpiring in the eastern regions of
Europe, and the time seems to have come
when our Government ought to have a
proper diplomatic . representation in
Greece.
RIGHTS OF NATURALIZED CITIZENS.
The"Gov'rnmcnt has claimed for all
persons not eonvicta'd, or accuse J, or sus
peeled of crime, an abvilute political right
of self-expatriation,, and a choice of new
national allegiance. 'Most of the Europe
an States have dissented from' the princi
ple, and have claimed a ri-'ht to hold such
of their subjects as hava immigrated to
and been naturalized in the United States,
and afterward returned on transient vis
its to their native countries,- to the per
formance of military service iu like man
ner as resident subjects. Complaints arising
from the claim in this respect made by
foreign Mates, have heretofore been ma&-1
ters of controversy between tho United
States and some of the European Powers,
and tho irritation consequent upon the
failure to settle this question,-increased
during tho wur in -which Pruia, Italy
and Austria "werff r(jcantlyengaged.
While Great Britain' has Dever acknowl
edged tho right of expatriation,.. sho tiite
not practically insisted upon it.
p
iIMtl,1
has bees equally forbearing ;'snJ cruesia
has proposed a compromise, which, al
though, evincing increased liberality, has
not been accepted by tho -United States.
Peace is now prevailing everywhere in
Europe, and the present saeiui' tu. be a
favorable' tiins for an assertion by- Con
gress of the principle, so long maintained,
.by the Executive Department, that natu
ralization by one State fully exempts the
native-born subject of any other Stato
from the pcrformanceof .military, sorvice
unSi r any foreign govern men t, i long as
he does not voluntarily renounce its rights
and benefits. ; - :
CONCLUSION.
.
In the performance of a' duty imposed
npon me by tbe Constitution, I have thus
submitted to the Representatives of the
Status and of the Peonle such Information
of our domestecand foreign affairs as tbe
public good seem to require. Our Gov
erntnent is now underfoiB? its most try
