The Torbett Issue and the State
Eefct.
The Supreme Court of the United
Sia ca having decided that the Tor
bett issue of the Ba.uk of Ienue
see was legally issued tmd the State
is bound for lis itdi iiiitioti, it will
probably bound upward very'iajiid
lv from 30 cents towards par. We
learn that at b ant $200,000 of this
issue is owned in Maury county by
W. J. Wliitthome, J M. Mays, John
Frierson, Lucius Frierson and oth
erB. The whole amount of this
issue outstanding is $800,000, which
will necessitate a levy upou the
property of 'M cents for this specific
purpose. Of course this will pre
clude the possibility of any imme
diate settlement of the State debt..
J'.nt suppose the same high tribunal,
the Supreme Court of the United
States, should decide that the .past
due coupons of the State were re
ceivable for taxes! Then the bond
holders would have us bound hand
and foot. The decisions of that
court are law, whether right or
wroDg. Had we not better com pro-
mise with them as soon as practica
ble? Such a decision is no more
improbable or unjust than the one
just made. The toils are tighten
ing. It is 11 knot for the Lcgisla
lure to untie. What will it do.
What can it do? Echo answers
What! While it is impracticable
not to say impossible for the debt
to be settled, atonce.it is important
that immediate steps should beta
ken to that end. The debt is Accu
mulating at n fearful rate $1,500,
000 per annum and the sooner it is
itdjusted the better.
Dr. K. L. Drake of Fayetteville is
a candidate for State Librarian, a
position for which he is eminently
qualified. We have no disparage
ments to make of the qualifications
of others, and especially do we dis
claim any reflection upon the claims
and qualifications of Mrs. llaskill,
should slit be a candidate. But the
qualifications of Dr. Drake are pe
culiar. J Icing a graduate of the
Universitv of N. C. a gentleman of
literary tastes and culture, and edi
tor of "Drake's Annals of the Army
of lennessce and fc.arly Western
History," he could and would be
useful to the State in coupling the
duties of Slate Librarian and editor
of the periodical named, in keep
ng up tne current History 01 tue
iSute and exhuming the past for
publication. If the olllee was at
our option, hc could bestow it upon
no man whose personal claims
would be stronger, orwlu.se qualifi
cations are more conspicuous.
The calendar of the House of Rep
resentatives, which has just been
officially prepared, is larger, say the
clerks, than any' calendar that has
been ready for a second session of
Congress for years. It is a docu
ment of thirty-live pages, and con
tains seven reports of committees
and bills undisposed ot, which mean
that they have had partial consider
ation: live House bills and resolu
tions, wiili Senate amendments;
11(5 from the Senate on first and
second reading; four concurrent
resolutions, ninety-one bills in
Committee of the Whole on the
Congress.
The Congress of the United
States assembled on Monday. The
President's Message was read to
both houses. Senator Beck intro
duced a bill to retire the. trade dol
lar and for its coinage into the
standard trade dollai. Senator
Voorhies also introduced a bill of
the same import. Senator Harris
introduced a bill providing for the
investigation of the causes of and
discover of the means by which
yellow fever and cholera may be pre
vented if possible.
Senator Blaine has set up the
usual -nowi already through a res
olution "inquiring" into the late
elections. Only ten Seuato-s were
absent the first day.
In the House 220 members were
present the first day, but nothing
was done except to hear and dis
cuss the 1 resident s message. Mr.
Wood of New York criticised and
condemned that part of the message
which referred to Southern elec
tions, citing Congress to only two
isolated instances in South Carolina
and Louisiana, but ignoring greater
violations in Northern States. He
said that the President had changed
front and bad placed himself into
the hands of the radical wing of the
adical party. Mr. Garfield defend
ed the President, of course. The
discussion was animated and interesting.

The State debt is up for discus

the late extra stssion to settle it,
and think ,et it ought to have done
so. However, we don't like the late

ill-tempered, and will not impress

A Proposed Yellow Fever Act.
Washington Dispatch: A bill will
be introduced early during the
coming session of Congress to es
tablish a national quarantine against
the yellow fever. It is proposed,
under authority of the United
States, to establish a quarantine, to
begin on May 1st of each year
and to terminate about November
20th, and to confide its enforcement
to the Navy Department. The
power of Congress to regulate com
merce with foreign countries is be
lieved to be ample for the purpose,
and the expense will hardly
be permitted to stand in the way of
establishing a system calculated to
save a larjre section of the country
from the terrible devastation b
which it has been afflicted man)"
times. It is probable that the Pres
ident, in his forthcoming annual
message, will earnest!) recommend
to Congress the passage of a meas
ure of this kind.

A General European "War.
Washington Special to the Cin
Cincinnati Enquirer: The represen
taiives 01 loieign governments in
Washington look anxiously for the
daily bulletins ot the progress of
the conflict between Great Britain
and Afghanistan, for it is generally
believed in diplomatic circles that
it will result in war with Russia,
and ultimately lead to a general
European war. Some of the best
informed members of the Diplo
matic Corps entertain this opinion
ami have reached this conclusion
after most careful examination of
all the attendant circumstances.
Sunday's American: John Du
ling, yesterday, received the follow
ing graphic description of the
Farmington assassination from his
brother, Thomas Dulisg, who is on
a visit at that place:
"The whole county is excited
over the Neil affair, and I will give
you an exact account of the whole
proceeding. Friday night Neil's
bnrn was discovered on fire, and of
course everybody went there. As
usual 1 outrun every one except
Osro Nowlin, and I would have
beat him bad I not had to dress.
Everyone began to suspect Bill
Porter, even while the barn was
burning, and on Saturday morning
C. A. Armstrong and Thomas
Jones, of Lewisburg, came over and
took out two warrants for Por'er,
one for attempted murder and one
for burning the barn I hey hunt
ed him all Saturday night but fail
ed to find him. Sunday morning
the)- heard of him In Bedford coun
tv, and immediately went for him.
The)' found him preparing to leave
Stapps , a man who lives just above
John Montgomery s old store.
When Porter saw them coming he
ran into the house and swore he
would not be arrested, and it look
ed very dangerous to try to take
him, as he had six or seven good
revolvers. He tonally surrendered
and wa3 brought here Sunday even
ing, but said he was not ready for
trial, and was then taken to Lewis
burs to await his trial, which was
set for 9 o'clock.
Monday morning, at this place,
he asrain appeared, but was not
ready for ttial, aud on Wednesday
morninsr "Rsk'ed for three weeks
time, which was refused. He then
waived examination and was bound
over to court.
The evidence is very strong
against him, and there is no one
who does not believe him guilty,
He threatened Neil s lite, and was
seen by two men Friday night com
ing toward Farmington with a shot
gun. The man that shot Neil, had
on a gum coat and black slouch
hat. These articles were found at
the house where Porter was arrest
ed. The gun, which was the prop
erty of Stapps, was also there. Mrs.
Stapps says Stapps loaded the gun
with slugs and buck-shot to shoot a
dor. and that it had not been used
until Porter took it down Friday
evening. Stapps left home Sunday
night for lexas.
There is, in fact, such conclusive
evidence against Porter that it is
believed he will be taken from jail
and hanged.
The incendiary fire was under
full headway when the shooting was
done, for I had dressed myself and
run to the front gate when the shot
was fired, and was at the house in a
very few minutes, or rather seconds,
but did not enter the house for
Mrs. Neil halloed to me to run for
a doctor.
The sun was loaded with slugs
larger than a buckshot, and nine of
them eptered Neil's body and right
arm.
Everthing Neil had was burned
up, and one horse belonging to a
man who lives at Franklin.
Neil may get well, hut is thought
to be in a critical condition now,

Hog Heat Dirt Cheap.
Sunday Nashville American:
large number of farmers were
1 lie city yesterday, ami manv
brought pork for sale. The cold
snap has been taken advantage of
for hog killing on a large scale.
The market was- in consequence,
glutted; and at the market-house,
choice cuts of pork could be bought
for 2J cents per ound, while back
bones and spare-ribs sold for 10
and 15 cents each, and when move
was wanted as much as forty pounds
was sold lor 2t cents. These puce
scarcely pay for the corn consumed
in fattening the hogs
Exchange: The year 1878 will be
a memorable one in the annals of
human misery. Famine and pesti
lence have done their own work in
some of the most populous regions
inhabited bv makind. India aud
China have been devastated by
both. War has added its terrors to
scourge ami starvation. lu yel

South, is mild by .comparison with

miseries rarely manifest theui
selves. Our planet must have wan

stars.
The New Haven Register says a
careful aualysis of the recent elec
tions is producing a very sobering
effect upon the republicans, and
whea they come face to face with
the issues of 1SS0 they will find
that what in 1878 they mistook for
Democratic reverse ami a iHpular
verdict for Republicanism, had iu
effect tha reality of welding the
Democratic hosl.s tuto a solid pha-

To the Honorable General Assem
bly of the State ol Tennessee:
The undersigned citizens of Ten
nessee, believing that the use 01 in
toxicating liquors is a fruitful
source of Thriftlessness, Poverty
and Taxation, and the greatest
cause of Crime in our State, do
earnestly petition your Honorable
Body to enact the following as a Lo
cal Option Law, believing that it is
simple, fair and efficient. But if not
so considered, wd pray that you en
act one similar thereto;
I'ltOPOSED LOCAL OI'TION LAW.
Section 1. The sale of distilled,
vinous and malt liquors, and all oth
er intoxicating beverages, shall be
subjeted to all f.he restrictions and
regulations that have been by stat
ule provided; and it shall be a priv
ilege subjected to the option of the
voters of each county ol this State,
Sec 2. Whenever twenty-five or
more of tho voters of any county
shall, in writiug request, the sheriff
of each county shall be required to
give public notice that at the next
regular election a vote will be taken
to determine whether or not intoxi

county.
Sec. 3. Said vote shall be taken
in the usual manner; the tickets to
be marked, "For license," and "No

Sec. 4. 1 he election officers shall

Sec. o. This Act shall take effect
from ant after its passage, the pub
lie welfare requiring it.
The message is absolutely 'devoid
of interest, except that part of it
which refers to Southern affairs,
and even that portion is very tame.
The American comments as follows
"From the beginning of the govern
ment to the present time, includ
ing the illustrious career of Grant
and the message which he certainly
wrote himself, one so weak and ut
terly without point or candid treat
ment of great questions, has not
been sent to Congress. It is cer
tainly not because we have reached
a period when no statesmanship is
required. Certainly there are ques
tions pending which might have
called forth all the abilities ot a
great statesman, but from Mr
Hayes they do not even obtain recognition."
But as our readers may be curi
ous to know what the President
does say about Southern violations
of law, we copy that portion of the
message entire. I he remainder of
tne document is positively noi
worth copying:
"The permanent pacification ol
the country by the complete pi otec
tion of all citizens iu every civil and
political right continues to be of
paramount interest with the great
body of our people. Ever' step in
this direction is welcomed with
public approval, and every iulerrup
tion of steady and uniform progress
to the desired consummation awa
kens general uneasiness' aud wide
spread condemnation. The recent
Congressional elections have fur
nished a direct and trustworthy test
of the advance thus far made in the
practical establisl ment of the right
of suffrage, secured by the Consti
tution to the liberated race iu the
Southern Slates. All disturbing
influences, real and imaginary, had
been removed from all these States.
The three constitutioal amend
ments, which conferred freedom
and equality of civil and political
rights upon the colored people of
the South, were adopted by the
concurrent action of the great body
ot good citizens who maintained
the authority of the National Gov
ernment and the integrity and per
petuitv of the union at such a cost
of treasure and life, as a wise and
necessarv embodiment in the organ
ic law of the just results of the war
The people of the former slave
holding States accepted these re
suits, and gave, in every practicable
form, assurances that the thirteenth
fourteenth and fifteenth amend
ments, and the laws passed in pur
suance thereof, should, in good
faith, be enforced, rigidly and lm
partially, in letter and spirit, to Hie
end that the humblest citizen, with
out distinction of race or color,
should, under them, receive full
and equal protection in person and
property, and in political rights and
privileges. By these constitution
al amendments, the southern sec
tion of the Union obtained a large
increase of political power in Con
gress and in the H.lectoral College,
and the country justly expected
that elections would proceed, as- to
the enfranchised race, upon the
same circumstances ot legal and
constitutional freedom and prolec
tion which obtained in all the oth
er States of the Union. The friends
of law and order looKed forward to
the conduct of these elections, as
offering to the general judgment of
the country an important opportu
nity to measure the degree in which
the right of suffrage could be exer
cised by the colored people, aud
would be respected by their fellow
citizens; but a more general enjoy
ment of freedom of suffrage by the
colored people, and a more just and
generous protection of that treedom
by the communities ot which they
form a part, were generally antici
pated than the record of the elec
tions discloses. In some of those
States in which the colored people
have been unable to make their
opinions telt in the elections, tne
result is mainly due to influences
not easily measured or remedied by
legal protection; but in the States
of Louisiana and South Carolina at
large, and in some particular con
gressional districts outside of those
states, the records of the elections
seem to compel the conclusion that
the rights of the colored voters
have been overridden, and their
participation in the elections not
permitted to be either general or
free.
It will be for the Congress for
which these elections were held, to
make such examinations into their
conduct as may be appropriate to
determine the validity of the claims
of members to their scats. In the
meanwhile it becomes the duty of
the Executive and Judicial Depart
ments of the Government, each in
its province, to inquire into aud
punish the violations of the laws of
the Uniteu States which have oc
curred. I can but repeat what I said
in this connection iu my last mes
sage, that whatever authority rests
with me to this end I shall not
hesitate to put forth, and J am un
willing to forego a renewed appeal
to the legislatures, the courts, the
executive authorities, and the peo
ple of the States where these wrongs
have been perpetrated, to give their
assistance towards bringing t jus
tice the offenders aiicl preventing a
repetition of the crime. No

I icspectfully urge upon your at
tention that the congressional elec

important sense, are justly a matter
of political interest and concern
throughout the whole country:
Each State, every political party, is
entitled to the share of power which
is coulerred by the legal and consti
tutioal suffrage. It is the right of
every citizen, possessing the quail
fixations prescribed bylaw, to cast
umntimidated ballot, and to
have his ballot honestly counted.
So long as the exercise of this
power and the enjoyment of this
right are common and equal, prac
tically as well as formally, submis
sion to the results of the suffrasie
will be accorded loyally and cheer
fully, and all the departments of

Senater Lamar explained to a re
porter of the New York Herald re
cently the cause of a solid South
The South is not solid because of
any antagonism to the North, but
because she has been made to suf
fer heavily since the war, and her
people have clung together to pre
serve their liberties. v uen the
question of self ffovernment has
been settled, and the .Southern
Stales are as free to act !or them
selves as the States of the North.
without Federal intervention, her
people will divide on national ques
tions, just as the people of the
North are divided. So long as the
Southern people must stand togeth
er to preserve their liberties the
South will be solid; when they ate
perfectly free a solid South will no
longer be possible.
Many laughable expedients were
adopted during the recent epidemic
to ward off the yellow monster.
One worthy gentleman wore a string
of red-pepper pods down his back,
and as he never had the fever the
laugh may not be at all against him.
Another gentleman wore a string of
onions around his waist. The col
ored people tried all their witch
preventatives, such as nailing horse
shoes on the front steps but a'l in
vain. " But jesting aside, it is as
serted that a number of the Howard
Association made it a rule to eat
sulphur every day and all escaped.
This fact is worth 'remembering.

From an Exchange: Persons who
patronize news papers should pay
promptly, lor the pecuniary pros
pects of the press have a peculiar
power in public prosperity. K the
printer is paid promptly, and his
jMicket book kept plethoric by
prompt paying patrons, he puts his
pen to his paper-in peace, his para
graphs are more pointed, he paints
his pictures ol passing events in
more pressing colors, and the peru
sal of his paper it n pleasure to the
people. J'ast? this piece of prover
bial philosoph) in some place wheie
all persons can perceive it.
In New England the lordly niann-
factuier requires his emploee lo
vote as he, the employer, desires,
under the ei:alty of losing his
place. If the employee fails to eee
it. he gets a ticket of leave the fol
lowing Saturday. Bulldozing may
not be called by the same name, but
it is the same crime in every Slate
in the Union.
Ex-Governor Seymour, in a talk
with bis neighbors on the eve of
the late election, appealed to thoso
present to use their reason about
questio'ns which concern themselves
and their families, and not to puz
zle their brain about the currency.
When we can sell what we have
and sell more than we buy, then we
must be prosperous; but when we
aro compelled to buy more than we
sell the end is sure to be bankrnpt
cy and ruin. The solution of ail
our problems lies, he thinks, in the
commerce of the country. '
What Vanderbilt said: Suppose
three men start in life with ten
thousand dollars each. Let the
first man invest his money in a
good business. Let the second in
vest his in a good business. Let
thvj third man lend his money to
the other two at ten per cc.t., and
in twenty years he will have all the
money.
