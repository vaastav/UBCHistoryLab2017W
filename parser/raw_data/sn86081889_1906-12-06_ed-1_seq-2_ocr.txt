TRADE IN THE
PHILIPPINE BUNDS
Report of the Chief of the Insular
Bureau.
AMERICA'S IRATTs DECUNNG
Capt. Mctntyre Urges the Adoption of a
Law That Would Decrease the Kate
on Philippine Product as Necessary
to the Welfare of the Islands Pro
posed Agricultural Bank.
Washington (Special). In his an
nual report as Acting Chief of the
Bureau of lnsulnr Affairs, Capt.
Frank Mclntyre, U. S. A., says:
"For more than four years, or
ever since the official declaration of
the termination of the Insurrection
against tho United Slates In the
Phillipplne Islands, the Philippine
Commission, the Secretary ot War
and the President have urged, as
most necessary to the welfare of the
people in the Philippine Islands and
to the successful government of those
Islands, tho passago of some bill
which would concede a lower rate of
duty on products of the Philippine Isl
ands coming to the United States
than the tariff imposed on the prod
ucts of foreign countries, and all of
their efforts to carry out this pur
pose have not as yet resulted In n
final vote which would indicate their
approval or disapproval of the pro
position. "It is-doubtful if at this time any
ether officers of the government have
imposed on them so difficult a task
as have the members of the Philip
pine Commission that of successful
ly governing these far-away islands.
It would seem, having by law im
posed the most difficult task upon
the Philippine Commission, that their
hands should be upheld in carrying
out those policies which they deem
essential.
Reciprocal Trade Arrangement.
"It should be borne in mind that
during this entire period everyone
connected with the government of
the Philippines has been impressed
with tho urgent need of some rsuch
legislation as that proposed, to lift
Ihe Filipino people out of the depth
of poverty Into which they have fal
len as the result of the wars, insur
rections and pestilcnco with which
those islands have been cursed for
a period of 10 years. And not only
have they thus agreed to the im
portance of this legislation to the
Islands, but they have been uniformly
of the opinion that such assistance
as would be given the depressed ag
riculture of the Philippines by this
act could in no wise harm any in
terest in the United States.
"A survey of the pending legisla
tion leads inevitably to the conclu
sion that it 13 by no means an altru
istic measure, but one of distinct ad
vantage to us, regardless of Its ad
vantage to the Filipinos. It may be
safely asserted that In no case Have
we been able to obtain from any
country a reciprocal trade arrange
ment so favorable to us as that em
bodied in this bill, which increases
our home market by over 7,000,000
people, producers exclusively, with
tho exception of a relatively few
cigars and cigarettes, of raw mater
ial, and, more Important still, of raw
material 75 per cent, of which com
petes with no product of the United
States, though of great uso In our
factories.
Agricultural Hunk.
"There is pending another measure
In both tho Senate and House of
Representatives on which there has
yet beeu no legislative action and
which would be of benefit to all
classes of Filipinos. This Is the bill
providing for the establishment of an
agricultural bank.
"Heretofore the inhabitants of the
islands away from Manila have had
no place in which they could secure
their savings and no place from
which they could borrow on reason
able terms the money necessary In
their agricultural or other industries.
Where such loans can be obtained at
all the borrower is forced to pay
from 1 to 10 per cent, a month, anj
there was absolutely no place in
which money could be deposited with
safety."

of American pork products have been

Heretofore Italy, in common with

ROB
THE
STARVING
Russia's Chief Gra'n Buyer
Has
Disappeared.
THE PHSANTSARE SICK AND NEEDY.
Enormous Profits Made by Those in
the Outrageous Deal The Govern
ment's Investigation Delays For
warding of Prompt Assistance to
the Distressed People.
St. Petersburg (By Cable). As a
result, of the investigation which tho
press campaign and public indigna
tion have compelled the ministry to
make Into the Lldval contract for
tho purchase of grain intended for
famine relief. In which Assistant
Minister of the Interior Gurko is al
leged to be involved, the sufferings
of the stricken population of tho Vol
ga provinces have been greatly aug
mented. On account of the disappear
ance of Lldval. the chief grain buyer,
In the fare of the threatened pro
ceedings, the purchase and shipment
of the sorely needed grain have been
suspended, and considerable time
must eiapse before new contracts
can be drawn up.
Further disclosures Increase the
gravity of M. Gurko's action in a
warding the contract to Lldval. Gov
ernor Alexandrovskl, of Penza pro
vince, who has been mentioned as
one of Lldval's sponsors, says he
never heard of the man until he re
ceived orders, through M. Gurko's
department, to purebnso grain only
through Lldval. It also develops that
the profits of the deal were even
greater than first supposed. The
Zemstvo committee of the neighbor
ing province of Tula was able to pur
chase grain for 6 1-3 cents per bushel
below Lldval's contract price
equivalent fn over $400,000 on the
whole contract.
Princes C. K. Lvoff and Orhellanl,
representing the Zernstvo bureau for

port that the situation Is even worse

counts. Sickness follows in the track

has broken out In the Kholfsk dis
trict of Saratov province, and, in the
absence of the needed food and medi
cine, is spreading widely.
POSTOITICE BOX SCHF.DULI
Older Formulated To Make Rent
Rates Uniform.
Washington, (Special). An order
has been issued by First Assistant
Postmaster General Hitchcock, effec
tive on January 1, looking toward
the adoption of uniform rates of rent
for boxes in postoffices. The revised
rates will affect every postofflce In
tho United States. The new schedule
adopts as the minimum rate for small
call boxes in small fourth-class post
offices the amount (10 cents per
quarter) now generally charged.
From this figure the rates advance
according to a carefully graduated
scale until they reach a charge for
small lock boxes at one postofflce
(New York city) ot $4 a quarter, the
amount now charged at that office.
It is not tho Department's inten
tion to make any general increase In
box rents. While some rates will be
raised, others will be considerably
lowered, the aim being to correct In
equalities. ROUGH RIDER NAMED.

GRAFTERS
WORK OE THE CENSUS BUREAU
Annual Report of the Director,
Dr. North.
Washington. D. C. (Special) Much
of tho work of the CenHtis Bureau
during the past , year, as disclosed
by the annual report of Dr. 8. N. D.
North, the director, JtiBt mado public,
related to the census of manufactures
of 1905, to the preparation and pub
lication of statistics on municipal fi
nance and to tho collection, tabula
tion and publication of prompt and
accurate reports on the cotton crop.
The report shows that tho work cost
the government $1,249,045, that sum
being $235,667 less than Congress
appropriated for it.
Annual estimates of tho population
of the various states and territories
are fiade by the census in order to
establish death rates In the vital sta
tistics reports. In 1905 13 states
took enumerations of the population,
tho total being 25.793,236. The es
timate of the census of tho popula
tion of those states at the same time
was 25,743,311, a difference of only
49,925.
Dr. North has planned, in connec
tion with tho annual municipal re
ports, a series of statistical studies
of Important phases of municipal de
velopment, Including parks, markets,
paving sewers, police and lire depart
ments, baths, school and libraries.
The Importance of statistics of this
chnracter is Indicated, the report
notes, by the fact that tho present
aggregation debt of cities of tho
United States containlnd over 8.000
inhabitants Is In excess of $1,600,
000,000. or "greater than that of the
combined debt of tho national and
state governments and of tho coun
ties, school districts and other minor
civil divisions."
The Director adds:
"In 1900 33 per cent, of the peo
ple of the United States resided In
cities having a population of 8,000
and over, and In a few decades over
one-half of the people will reside in
those cities. Tho problem of self
government is, therefore, becoming
one of city, government."
The Director ndvocates the taking
of a quinquennial census of agricul
ture. The report says concerning the cot
ton crop that It has been the earnest
desire of the bureau to bring its
system of reporting to the highest
possible degree of efficiency.
"A complete record of the quantity
of cotton ginned." it states, "Is not
possible unless the ginners report ac
curately tho output of their gins.
That, the great majority of them do
this I have no doubt; that many fail
ed to do so is -made evident by the
distribution report, and in some sec
tions there are signs of a more or
less concerted purpose to understate
the glnnings in the hopo of thereby
influencing the current market price
of the crop. There can bo no ques
tion that the census ginning reports
have been worth many millions of
dollars to the cotton planters by
protecting the market from assaults
of speculators, whose privately gath
ered statistics no longer carry weight
when they differ from thoso of the
census.
Director North recommends tho
enactment of more rigid laws to en-
able census officers to secure infor
mation. BIG BLAZE IX GALL1T7.K.V.

SAMUEL SPENCER KILLED
-ON HIS OWN ROAD
Following Train Crashed Int3 His
Private Car.
7 PERSONS DEAD AND 11 INJURED.
Failure of a Block Operator To Stop
the Second Train While Repairs Were
Being Made On Spencer's Train
Caused the Collision Bodies Burned
Beyond Recognition.
Lynchburg. Va. (Special.) Sam
uel Spencer, president of the South
ern Railway Compnny, formerly
president of the Baltimore nnd Ohio
Railroad Company and universally
recognized as one of the foremost
men In the development of the South,
was killed while riding In a private
car on hs own railroad at 6 o'clock
Thursday morning.
Six others shared his fnU, which
camo as the result of a rear-end col
lision between two fast passenger
trains 10 miles south of Lynchburg
and a mile north of Lawyers Depot.
These included his guests, Philip
Schuyler, of historic family, a retired
capitalist of New York, and Charles
D. Fisher and Francis T. Redwood,
both prominent In financial and so
cial circles In Baltimore.
Mr. Spencer's destination was
Friendship, N. C, where he was go
ing on a hunting trip with Messrs.
Schuyler, Fisher, Redwood nnd Mer-
III as his guests.
The collision was between the
Jacksonville express and tho Wash
ington and Southwestern vestibule
limited, both southbound. President
Spencer and his entire party, as far
as Is known, wcro sleeping when tho
collision occurred, and tho probabili
ties are that all ot them excepting
Dispatcher Davis were killed Instant
ly. It is certain that life was ex
tinct before the flames leached them.
President Spencer's body was burned
almost beyond recognition, as was
that ot Mr. Fisher. The body of Mr.
Schuyler was taken from under the
train before It was burned very much,
having been singed only slightly.
President Spencer's car was attached
to the rear of the Jacksonville train.
which was standing still when struck.
President Spencer was lying di
rectly under the big locomotive of
t he rear train. So great wns tho
force of the impact, that the forward
train was sent at least 150 feet
ahead, the locomotive going over and
upon the body of Mr. Spencer. Until
after the debris burned Itself out
nnd the engine cooled off the bodies
could not be removed.
The impact drove the combination
car forward and (he express car lift
ed up, together with its trucks, nnd
r rushed the car 40 feet, leaving the
remainder of the car strewn with tons
of baggage and colored passengers,
who were pushed back lifco rats as
the express car crushed the combina
tion car.
Tho combination car did not leave
tho track, and In clearing tho track
the express car was hauled to a sid
ing a mile distant on top and In the
debris of the combination car. How
tho negro passengers in this com
partment, which is known as tho
jimcrow part of tho train, escaped,
none of them being killed, is beyond
explanation.
Tho wreck occurred on tho crest
of a steep grade, when the Atlanta
train could not have been running
more than 30 miles an hour, if that
fast. Had it been a mile or two
farther south the number ot dead
might have been frightful, as the
train was about two hours behind Its
schedule, a condition in the grade
there that would have meant a speed
of more than 60 miles an hour.
One of tho worst phases of the ac
cident wns tho heartless manner in
which a few passengers and some ot
the attaches, especially some of the
porters of the Atlanta train, ran
sacked the wrecked cars for plunder.
F. M. Curtis, of Jamestown, N. Y.,
who was a passenger on the Jack
conville train, saw one negro porter
go through a lady a grip. Ho saw
him throw away such things us were
of no value to him and appropriate
those things that he wanted. Mr.
Curtis declared that he would have
certainly killed the porter if he had
had something to do it with.
Not a few passengers engaged in
this ghoulish business, and a large
number of valuables und much money
which was scattered about tho wreck
ed train were taken.

Philadelphia bankers who are as
sociated with the Rockefeller bank

not he any tighter during December
than it is now,
if President Cassett were to fol
low Harrlman's example he could
make even a more remarkable show

than was made with Union Pacific's.
A well-known broker who is a di
rector lu a national bank as well as
in a trust company says: "I regard
the new Philadelphia Clearing House
rules as too strict for the trust com
panies to accept, or at least most of
thcin. I believe tho trust companion
should form a clearing houso of their
own and then pay one national bank
to clour all their checks for thorn.
"I don't thing anyone can' deny
thut Harrlman's Union Pacific state
ment was prepared with the sole view
of making the most fluttering exhibit
possible," said a well-known Phila
delphia banker. "The exhibit war
first rate, but I question Harrlman'r
motives in making it. Jn these dayr
't is possible for certain powerfu'
men to make in the stock market
vastly more than anywhere else
Homotimes it seems as if certain cor
