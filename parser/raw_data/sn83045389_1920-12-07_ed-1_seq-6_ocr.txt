Virginia No Stale for Mob*
V, IUGIXIA has no place for nioli vmi
geatice. Ii will no! brook. how.-Vfr
provocative the cau-o, interft rrnco by mob
law with Hi" orderly course of judicial
procoiiuro. which, in scores of ca.?c.?. has
proved ii.so!f just and swil't. That there
is a vigorous determination to uphold tli?
majesty of the law i.s known now to the
members of that Appalachian mob which
stormed Hi* Wise County jail and sought
to rob the law of its rights to punish crime, |
by substitution public lawlessness and exe
cuting sumuii.rv vengeance on a negro ac
cused of brutal assault on an aged white
man. >
To uphold the law against the attackers
of the Wi.se jail meant bloodshed, but. re
grettable as it was, they knew that they were ,
taking the law Into their own hands when
they advanced to the attack, and the public .
generally will commend the action of the
defending guards who tired into them for ;
the protection of their prisoner. It also
commends the prompt action of Governor t
Davis in dispatching companies of the Na
tional Guard to ttie scene to prevent a re
otirrence of the mob outrage. With the sol
diers on guard and the mob spirit dissl- ;
patcd. it may be expected that there will
he no further trouble, and the law will be <
permitted to determine the facts and mete ;
out proper justice. Uul the Wise County
incident should not, and unquestionably
will not. b" permitted to close there. For 1
the maintenance of order and to prevent j
auch outbreaks in the future, the long tmi j
of the law should reach out ami punish
the instigators aiHi'*"l><-adt-1> of those who \
detldd i -. for :n th'-ir defiance of the law I
they made themselves equallj guilty with
tin a i .it'it wni.se life they sought. 1
Virginia in the last score of years l|;ts |
been particularly free from mob violence, j
Only once in that time iias the law been '
cheated of its dues, and the Stale, with thi
lofty rerord, will not permit its name to
he made a hywuid for lax justice, and its
fame to b ? dtagged in the mire before those
critics who overlook no opportunity to point
the finger of scorn at the South.

Cotmciliiiniilc Incompetence
BY its action last night in denying the
Mayor's request that it (is a salary of
$11!.000 the year fur the- Director of Pub
lic Works, the Common Council, in out
r ?ht and brazen defiance of a heavy pre
ponderance of the public will, and for rea
sons which, so far as can be ascertained,
mount no higher than petty politics, ab
solved the .Mayor from further responsibil
ity for results that may accrue from a
cheap, niggardly policy in this, the city's
most important department.
1 Tin- Mayor, answerable to the city as its
responsible head, believed $12,000 noce*o
sary to secure the services of the type
; o{ engineer Richmond nt-eris. The Finance
Committee approved his request and pro
j gnssive citizens almost en masse urged the
! Council to grant it, but the Common Couu
i cil, or a minority sufficient to defeat it. un
der the two-thirds rule, led by James
iJickerson. "Mayor of Jefferson Ward,"
who professed to "set' a nigger in the wood
pile." flouted the people's will and thwarted
Richmond in its plans for a bigger and a
hotter city. Council thus assumes the re
sponsibility. It has said by its vote that,
it wants a cheap man, and the burden will
he upon it if it gets cheap results.
With the Mayor's request denied, and in
further pursuit of its cheeseparing policy,
the Council voted its belief that the De
partment of Public Works could function
adequately enough under a $7.7f>0 man.
Dickerson and Sullivan objecting even to
this amount. That is the figure tho Coun
cil has sent back to the Finance Commit
tee as the measure of what it is willing
to pay.
How long. O Lord! how long, will Rich
mond's interests continue to suffer at the
hands of a Council that either cannot or
will not function? For months now the
salary question has been used in a politi
cal game of battledore jind shuttlecock. It
has been buffeted about from committee
to Common Como -i io tiie Hoard of Alder
men, and buck again, kicked about like a
football, with a tinal determination no
nearer in sight now than when it was first
discussed. Meanwhile. Richmond's pro
main of street and sewer building, all the
vastly important work that comes under the
Public Works Department, with the- expen
diture of millions of dollars, is neglected.
Thus does Richmond suffer from coun
(iimanic incompetence. lint Council has
shown its willingness to bear the onus of
inaction, and some day it will be called
upon to pay the penalty.
Help Fight the Plague
IN the manifold duties and pleasures Inci
dent to the Christmas season, now al
most upon us. let no one forget that tho
poor and the sicl; we have always with us,
that the great white plague knows no holi
day and takes no vacations, but makes its
gaunt presence felt in every gathering and
spreads its desolation and sorrow in tens 1
of thousands of American homes regard
less of the season.
It is to combat the ravages of this great
est of all human scourges, to stay its har
vest of death and misery and poverty, that
the Richmond Tuberculosis Association,
branch of the national organization, is sell
ing its little Christmas tuberculosis seals,
lis goal for Richmond is $20,000. a trilling
sum in comparison with amounts that have
been asked and more than given for other
causes no more worthy, and Insignificant
when one considers the alleviation of
human suffering for which it will be used.
With the money derived from the sale
e! these little seals, emblems of mercy, the
association maintains hospitals, dispen
saries, open-air schools, summer camps,
conducts educational campaigns, seeks out
case*, of disease and employs nurses. It is
the one bulwark against which the plague
io battering vainly, the one association
which, on the offensive every hour of the
day and every day of the year, is reduc
ing the number of Its victims, checking its ;
fatal inroads and educating the public along ?
lines of hygiene and sanitation that some I
day, let it In1 hoped, will make tuberculosis ;
as rare as the once dreaded leprosy is today. ;
Keep these things in mind when you ,
see one of the seals, then buy generously
in the knowledge that you are doing your
part as a soldier in one of the greatest and
most ?righteous battles in which humanity !
ever has been called to engage.
Richmond Welcomes Hero of Verdun
Ri< IIMOND is highly honored in having ?
as its guest today Cenernl Robert i
Heorges N'ivelle. the hero of Verdun. iloth
in his own person and as a representative i
of the French nation Richmond is proud j
to d<> him honor. In the hour of its great- i
est crisis he saved France from a defeat
that would have boon the culminating blow |
in striking her helpless at tin* feet of a
merciless foe. In all the annals of military :
history, there is not recorded a more heroic I
delense on so large a scale against over- !
w helming odd>. Hurled hack from Verdun,
the enemy never again recovered the esprit
<le corps that characterized tiiat fierce on
slaught, and In that d< leat was sowed the i
??'evils of disintegrating morale that finally j
ended with his surrender.
tieneral Nivelle will find awaiting him i
? i. liichmond a welcome both generous and '
nthusiastie in its expression. In sincerity I
? t love and admiration every heart will i
acclaim him. Kver.v home will b- open to
hint, and there Is no hospitality that its citi
zens know how to bestow that will he with
held from him. In very truth, tho free
dom of th? eliy is his. tu do wliii it as he
wills:. Richmond has felt the wrath of a
triumphant enemy, and it knows how to
honor a hero, who was sun essfnl in repel
ling an invader !<-n times inon brutal in
t dent ruetlvene^s.

Health Talks by Dr. Brady
An the Devil <tuntra Scripture.
? ? rlirh.. bv Niftl ?
' Tho reason why I wrote you about hard
ening of tho krierles and heart dlHiiuo?," writes
a reader, "was that 1 had Just discovered my
doctor had been giving mo digitalis for a
considerable tUne. Your valuable monograph
on the subject confirms my opinion. You
say. 'It Is absurd to think of digitalis as help
ful in heart disease." I should not have taken
It had 1 known what It was. Is It too late
to change.' What shall 1 do?" (D. w. W.)
This reader writes a letter which shows
he Is not without good education. And yet
the reader has Jumped to a conclusion scarcely
warranted by what 1 said of dlgitatls and
arteriosclerosis and heart disease. The read
er quote* me correctly, but makes a devilish
job of It. like the Oid lioy quoting Scripture.
In the monograph which our reader quotes
i said this:
"There Is a popular notion that certain
remedies, medicinal or non-medicinal, are
'good for' weak heart, hardened arteries, high
I.lot<1 pressure, paralysis, kidney trouble or
nephritis, and other manifestations of cardio
vascular disease. Certain remedies, medicinal
and' otherwise, arc good fot the patient: but
wo <;an ii.'?urc you that no known remedy of
any character whatever Is good for all cases
?of arterial heart, kidney or brain trouble, due
tit cardiovascular disease. The remedy must
be adapted to the?individuul requirements In
. very instance, and cannot be applied by rule
of thumb. Kor Instance, It Is absurd to think
of digitalis as being helpful for heart dis
ease, or to think of massage as being good
for arterial hardening, or to think of butter
milk or ISulgarltin bacillus cultures as being
good for autointoxication. These remedies
will do no good in Ilrown's case; have no ap
i arent effect in Smith's ease; ai?d perhaps <lo
serious harm In tho case of .tones."
Now have I condemned dlgilalis or any other
remedy for heart disease or havo T merely
appealed to sound sense and suggested that
Uigitaiis or oilier remedy should be intelli
gently employed if employed at all?
Digitalis !h a veritable sheet anchor in the]
treatment of many cases of hoirt disoaso. but
like many other remedies powerful for good,
digitalis l.? also capable of doing serloun harm
when unintelllgently used, and by unltitelll- '
gent use. of course. I mean when It ir pre- ,
scribed for a patient who has a fool for a
doctor, or as we say in France, a patient who
attempts to doctor himself.
l.arge dose.-! of on*' of the physiologically
tested (that U?. proved active) preparations
i i digitalis often work wonders, but only i
physician can judge how much, how often, or
how long digitalis should lie given. When .
tin- drug Is to be continued any lepgth of time, j
certainly its effects must be observed at regu- .
lar intervals anil the dosage determined ae- !
..or.litigly. if the physician knows his busi- j
ness and mixes bruin* with his medicines ,
Digitalis is a valuable drug. nut 1 repeat that j
? t is capable of doing series harm, although ,
n.ost persons who nibli'.e at It are getting no ,
effect whatever, save in Imagination.

WASIIINOTllN', Deo. 0.?Diplomacy no lunger!
can be mainly concerned with political ques- |
tlons "but :j:ust devote greater attention to I
fur-reach.ng economic Issues," Secretary Colby'
declares in a memorandum accompanying his |
cutlmute:; uf appropriations for the State De
partment for 1S22, addressed to the Secretary
of the Treasury, and made public today.
Secretary Colby estimstrs that $11,0S3,S4S.04
will be necessary for the maintenance of for
eign relations, an increase o\er the previous j
year of nearly };1,OUO.OOO.
The United States. Mr. Colby said, finds itself
in keen commercial competition with other na- I
tiond which are reviving and Intensifying their
efforts "to gain foreign markets; to occupy
tin) markets tnrmerly controlled by enemy
powers, ana jo attain a higher degree of eco
nomic production." lie adds for that reason
? an adequate stall of technical experts" in the j
foreign service is needed.
Dack of funds to pay for needed help in the
consular service abroad li.is brought about de- !
plorable conditions, the secretary asserts, add
ing that while "exigencies of diplomatic and (
> onsular work demand that our represents- :
lives be men of exceptional ability and attain- <
rr.ents," the service is losing niauy of Its ni"St j
ettlcient men through tailing to "provide them ;
with an appropriate standard of living."
The aim of the department the memorandum I
says, while giving "effective purpose and di- 1
rection to diplomacy, should afford even greater |
facilities fur supplying more precise and bet
ter digested material to the Department of
Commerce, which Is in direct mid continuous
contact with the business world and which is
c.iarged with the dissemination of commercial
information."
