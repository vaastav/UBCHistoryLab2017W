Thn Kcuinrknble Change In tbs Member

lentatlves Organization of the lalter
Mr. Reed Elected Speaker The Presi
dent' MeRRfi To-morrow.
Washington, Deo. 2. The senate and
house of representatives were called
to order promptly at noon to-day In
their respective chambers, amid the
usual scenes of animation 'and excite
ment. By 10:30 o'clock, an hour and a
lialf before the time of meeting, the
puibllo galleries in both houses were
filled and an eager crowd overflowed
Into the outer corridors. Many women
were in the throng.
No such revolution In the personnel
of the members of the house has oc
curred in recen't years as was evident
at the beginning of the session to-day.
There were 163 new faces In a total of
356 memibers. The republicans control
thirty-one of the forty-four state dele
gations. They have twenty solid dele
gations, while the democpaita have but
four. In the once "solid South" the
Kentucky and Tennessee delegations
are almost evenly divided. In. North
Carolina and Missouri the republicans
control. The West Virginia delegation
is solidly republican. Texas and Vir
ginia each has a, republican, and South
Carolina and Alabama send populists.
The number of populists in the house
Is reduced from twelve to six. Among
those whose absence was most notice
able were Judge Holiman, dem., of In
diana, who began his congressional ser
vice in 1859; the silver advocate. Bland,
of Missouri, William M. Springer, derm,
of Illinois, General Hooker, William L.
'Wilson, Bourke Cockran, dem., of New
Tork, and Tom Johnson and M. D.
Harter, dem., of Ohio.
The presence of new blood was quite
as noticeable In the usually slow-changing,
senate as in the house. Among
the more notable of the absentees were
s Butler, dem., of South Carolina, Ran
som, dem., of North Carolina, Coke,
dem., of Texas, Dolph, rep., of Oregon,
Manderson.irep., of Nebraska, and Mc
pherson, dem., of New Jersey, each of
whom had served more than one term.
Of the thirty senators whose terms ex
pired on the Fourth of March last, only
thirteen were re-elected.
Among 'the new men are Marlon But
ler, pop., of North Carolina, vice M. W.
Ransom; Thomas H. Carter, rep., of
Montana, vice Thomas C. Power;
Stephen B. Elkins, rep., of West Vir
ginia, vice J. N. Camden; John H. Gear,
rep., of Iowa, Vice J. F. Wilson; George
W. MdBride, rep., of Oregon, vice J. N.
Dolph; Knute Nelson, rep., of Minne
sota, vice W. D. 'Washburn; W. J.
Sewell, rep., of New Jersey, vice J. R.
McSPherson; Benjamin R. Tillman, dem.,
of South Carolina, vice M. C Butler,
and George R. Wetmore, rep., of Rhode
Island, vice Nathan F. Nixon, The
preponderance of seats on the republi
can side was noticeable, three having
been transferred' from the democratic
division 'to accommodate Messrs. El
kins, Bake, and Sewell, "and one for
Mr. Butler, populist. Four of the six
Independents now have seats in the re
publican section.
The change in the appearance of the
senate chamber was quite as great as
the membership. , Probably the most
Striking change In the furnishings was
that made in the chairs. Heretofore
the floor has been covered by a varied
assortment of eats. These have 'been
removed and eighty-eight square ma
hogany chairs substituted. New car
pets have been laid, and all the work
painted "or varntehed. In the niches of
the gallery left for the busts of dead
Vice presidents, there are two additions,
one of Richard M. Johnson and the
other of Millard Fillmore. A new light
ing apparatus has been put in, con
cealed above the skylights.
The senators began to assemble early
In the day, exchanging greetings and
renewing acquaintances. Mr. herman,
rep., of Ohio, crossed the chamber and
greeted his associate, Mr. Brlce, dem.,
who was in a group with Messrs. Gor
man, dem., of Maryland, Cockrell, dem.,
of Missouri, and Harris, dem., of Ten
nessee. The floral decorations were un
usually abundant. The desk of Mr.
Shoup, rep., of Idaho, held fruit as well
as flowers.
Exactly at 12 o'clock the vice presi
dent called the senate to order. Pray
er was offered by the .blind chaplain of
the senate, who referred to the affliction
In the family of ex-Senator Wilson of
Iowa, and to tlhe absence of Isaac Bas
sett, the veteram doorkeeper of the
senate, who ds now dangerously ill.
The first business transacted was the
swearing in by the vice president of
new senators and of those re-elected.
The usual formal resolutions were
quiokly adopted, that of Mr. Cockrell,
dem., of Missouri, to provide for senate
sessions beginning at 12 a. daily, that
of Mr. Sherman, rep., of Ohio, to notify
the house that a quorum of the senate
was present and ready to proceed with
businebs; that of Mr. Vilas, dem., of
Wisconsin, to provide for a committee
of two senators and two members to
wait upon, the president and notify him
that congress a waited any communica
tion the executive branch desired to
present. The presiding officer designat
ed Messrs. Was and Allison for the
committee to wait on the president.
At 12:30 o'clock a recess of an hour
was taken. ,
At 1:30, when tlhe senate reconvened,
Mr. Prudden, the president's secretary,
was In the chamber with word that
the president's message would not be
submitted to-day, and, therefore, at 1:30
o'clock, on motion of Mr. Sherman', the
eenate adjourned until to-morrow.
The republican senators were im cau
cus for half an hour after the senate ad
journed, but adjourned until Wednes
day without taking any action on the
question of reorganization of the sen
ate. At fifteen minutes of 12 the floor of
the house was cleared. At 12 o'clock
Colonel Isaac Hill, the deputy sergeant-at-arms,
lifted the mace into place, the
flag above the house was run up, and
James Kerr, the clerk of the last house,
called the Fifty-fourth house of repre
sentatives to order. The Rev. Mr. Bag
by of this city, the chaplain of the last
house, offered the invocation. Under
the direction of Mr. Kerr the roll of
the members elected to the Firty-fourth
bouse was called.
At the conclusion of the roll call Mr.
Kerr announced that 'M of the 35S"
members' ef epresent. He also an
nounced that no credentials hud been
received from the Tenth New York and
the First Nevada districts. In accord,
ance with the custom he then stated
that the first thing in order was the se
lf ction of a presiding oftluer, and culled
for nominations for speaker.
No nominating speeches were made.
Mr. Grosvenor, rep., of Ohio, chairman
of the republican caucus, placed In
nomination Thomas B. Reed of Maine;
Mr. Sayres, dem., of Texas, presented
the name of Charles F. Crisp of Geor
gia, and Mr. Kern, pop., of Nebraska,
placed In nomination John C. Bell, pop.,
of California. During the roll call Rep
resentative Craln, dem., of Texas, cre
ated a momentary flurry by coming in
to the hall long eonugh to answer to his
name and voting for Culberson, dem.,
of Texas, instead of for Crisp, the dem
ocratic caucus candidate.
The result of the vote was:
Reed 23 1
Crisp ( 95
Bell 6
Culberson, dem., of Texas 1
Total 835
The announcement of Mr. Reed's
election was greeted with great ap
plause. In accepting the speakership Mr.Reed
said:
It will not be unbecoming In me, I
hope, if I acknowledge to this assembly
that It is very agreeable to me to stand
once more in the place which I left four
years ago. Of the past, however, I
shall not speak, for the past speaks for
itself In terms more fitting and appro
priate than any words which could
come from my lips. Nor shall I speak
of the future, for we are not putting oil
the harness, but putting it on. Tet I
think I may venture to say of the fu
ture, in the light of the past, that if we
do some things which for the moment
seem inadequate, it may be that time,
which has justified itself for us on many
occasions, may do so again. Those who
have acted with wisdom heretofore may
be fairly expected to act with wisdom
hereafter.
I am sorry to say that the pleasure
associated with the honor you have be
stowed on me, an honor which no Amer
ican citizen can fail to appreciate, and
for which I givte thanks, is but for the
moment, while the cares and responsi
bilities extend over many days. So far
as the performance of my duties affects'
the whole people of the Unified 'States, I
Invoke their considerate judgment. So
far as it affects the members of this
house, I ask from both sides of the
chamlber that cordial co-operation with
out which I cannot hope to succeed,
assuring them that no effort on my
part will (be spared to aid them in the
performance of their duties by tihat en
tire impartiality which is their just
due.
After Mr. Reed's election the other
republican caucus nominees for house
offices were elected. '
The swearing In of the members then
'began. Mr. Newlands, pop., of Nevada,
whose credentials had not yet arrived,
was allowed to take the path. Mr. Cum
mlngs, dem., of New York, who was re
cently leleoted from the Tenth New York
district to succeed the late Alexander
Campbell, was also sworn In.
On account Of the long time required
for the organization of fine house the
transmission of the president's mes
sage to congress was delayed and will
be sent in to-morrow, probably during
Hhe noon hour.

An Their Adventure on a Bicycle Trip to
Merlden.
J. Harwood Pearce, nine years old,
eldest son of Councilman John H.
Pearce of the Fifth ward, and two
young companions are the heroes of a
thrilling bicycle ride to Merlden. It all
happened last Saturday. Master Pearce
with the two other boys, young repub
licans, named ' Bishop and Beeler, re
spectively, thought Merlden was a good
place to do a little missionary work In,
and so they set forth at 11 a. m. deter
mined to bring that '"iburg" into the
republican column. It was an hour be
fore dinnier, ibut what cared these young
enthusiasts for food or drink, so long
as they were buoyed up by a massive
bicycle and the golden fruit of repub
licanism. It was 2:30 when they arrived In Mer
lden, and after a short rest the youth
ful crusaders held conference and de
cided that Meriden was a way off from
New Haven, that it was a desolate
place, barren and unfruitful, and that
there wasn't anything worth bragging
about In the whole '"burg," anyhow.
They also concluded that they were
hungry, and incidentally remembered
that they were still suffering from
democratic hard times, and so If they
only had five cents how nice it would
be to spend It for a loaf of bread.
But even five cents were not to be had
of any of the trio.
As a last resort they determined to
try the hospitality of Meriden and be
fore passing from the outskirts of the
city they wheeled up to a handsome
residence, rung the bell, waited and
then found the dwelling was vacant.
The next house they halted at the "la
dy" chased them away. Finally, hun
ger preying upon their vitality and re
membering that New Haven was a long
way off, that there was a woods near
the vicinity and darkness coming on,
they determined to make one more ef
fort to get something to eat before the
dash for home.
So they drew up once more before
another residence. This time the lady
answered their call, and, smiling, in
vited them in, gave them some cake,
crackers and bread, told them she was
formerly a resident of New Haven, and
wished them luck and "God-speed"
home.
They now felt stronger. It was al
ready dusk, with the dark woods be
yond and the thought on their mind
of a democratic donkey looming up and
emerging from the thicket. Young
Pearce, however, said he would give
three cheers for Old Glory and imitate
the eagle's screech, if the donkey should
make his appearance. This imfbued his
companions with enthusiasm, and as
Master Pearce afterwards said, "We
just made our wheels fly."
They passed the woods in safety and
arrived in New Haven at about six
o'clock, determined never to run to Mer
iden again.

JtAll.nO Alt XOTES.
Certain United State Kxprem Tralni Din
continued on the New England.
A new time table on the New Eng
land road is officially announced, un
der which a considerable number of
passenger trains are discontiued. In
this connection an important announce
ment was made yesterday at the office
of the New Haven company, which con
trols the New England road, and which
Itself uses the Adams Express service.
The announcement states that the
United States Express company has a
contract for a term of years with the
old New England company, but the re
organized company holds that It has
the right to reject that contract if it
finds it disadvantageous or maintain it
if advantageous. The company has ac
cordingly dropped several special ser
vice United States Express trains which
have been poorly patronized by passen
gers and have been unprofitable. One
United 'States Express train each was
between Boston and Hopewell Junction
to company will leave on, and its gen
eral policy toward the United States
Express service on trains will be deter
mined after further experience. It may
carry on a plan for western service
over the Philadelphia, Reading and
New England, but that plan has not yet
been perfected.
IMPROVEMENTS ON THE CONSOLI
DATED. It Is reported that the New Haven
company will remove a part of its
tracks on the west side of the Housa
tonio river at Sheltoo, and build a new
freight yard, and union passenger and
freight depots on the fiats for the cities
of Ansonia and 'Derby. In that case a
number of dangerous grade crossings
will be abolished and the new railroad
structures will be near the center of a
population of some 20,000 persons?
Plans are also reported to double
track the New Britain and MIddletown
branches so as to make two tracks be
tween those two cities, the branches of
which connect at Berlin.

It is said that work will be begun in
the spring on two ten-story buildings
in New Haven, one of which is certain
to go up, while the other is projected,
but the matter of building ie yet unset
tled. One architect will probably de
sign both buildings, although different
parties will put them up. One of the
buildings will be erected on Chapel

The Coming Grand Performance of the

holoUta.
The sale of seats for the Gounod so
ciety's grand performance of "The Re
demption," to 'be given Tuesday after
noon and evening next week, will open
to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock at the
ibox office of the Hyperion. It being the
society's tenth season it is intended to
make thisconcert an anniversary affair
and the most complete and brilliant
performance In its history. The splen
did reputation of the soloists alone will
insure a crowded hone.
Mrs.Corlnne Moore-La weon, the beau
tiful young Cineinnatian, is a soprano
of the highest rank, her fame having
been won in the leading cities of thi3
country and England. She was the
principal soloist in the great midsum
mer rendition of "The Messiah" under
the direction of Walter Damrosch at
Ocean Grove, where she was heard by
an audience of ten thousand. Her suc
cess here was phenomenal, people ris
ing up from their seats en masse to ap
plaud. The New York Evening Post says:
An arioso from F. Grant Gleason's op
era "Montezuma" proved to be interest
ing, both melodically and harmonically.
It was sung by Mrs. Corinne Moore
Lawson, a young lady of such rare
beauty, of the southern type, that the
audience was In danger of listening
with the eyes Instead of the ears. Her
singing, however, evoked more enthu
siasm than anything else on the pro
gram, and after being warmly recalled
several tiiwes she was compelled to re
peat her number. She has a pure voice
of excellent quality, clear and sympa
thetic, and of faultless intonation, and
she sings with taste and expression.
The London Times says: Mrs. Law
son, as Venus, confirmed the very fa
vorable opinion formed on her first ap
pearance; her singing high notes, and
the, beautiful quality of her voice
throughout its entire 1-ange, produced
their full effect. In the solo from the
"Brahm's Requiem" Mrs. Lawson prov
ed herself a completely satisfactory ex
ponent of this calss of music. The
perfect purity of her voice, the refine
ment of her phrasing, and the earnest
ness of her interpretation, were equally
conspicuous.
It is safe to say that no bass of recent
years will give more satisfaction than
Dr. Carl Dufft of New York. In ora
torio work he Is considered the peer of
any living singer. He has a superb
voice and is one of the most consum
mate artists on the stage. He Is sure
to win Instant favor. Both Mrs. Law
son and Dr. Dufft will make their first
appearance in New Haven.
Of Dr. Dufft the St. Paul Globe says:
"The Creation" afforded Dr. Dufft an
excellent opportunity to display his
very wonderful vocal powers. He
charmed the audience with his splendid
voice and artistic renditions.
Miss Gertrude May Stein, the contral
to, is a rare artist and already a great
favorite here, as well as Mr. W. II. Rle
ger.who is without a rival among Amer
ican tenors.
Of Miss Stein the Detroit Tribune
says: Miss Gertrude May Stein, con
tralto, sang the aria from "Joan of
Arc." Her voice is rich, powerful and
resonant. Her stage presence Is pleas
ing. Of Mr. Rieger the Montreal Witness
says: Mr. William H. Rieger is a great
favorite here and last night he was re
ceived with much favor. He sang his
part in "Elijah" in a most artistic man
ner and was vigorously applauded.
Miss Lily Welch, the charming New
York soprano and one of the most prom,
lsing artists on the stage, will perhaps
sing the most unique role In the work,
that of "Angel" and the "Celestial
Voice."
The orchestra will come from' Boston
and will be complete in every particu
lar, including a harp and four extra
trumpeters, the latter specially engag
ed for the wonderful chorus, "Unfold,
Ye Portals Everlasting."
At the rehearsal last evening, when
Mr. Agramonte took up the baton, near
ly every member was present. The
whole oratorio was carefully studied,
and at the close Mr. Agramonte ex
pressed himself as well satisfied with
the work of the chorus. He said: "I
shall expect the best performance the
Gounod has ever given."
The final rehearsal occurs on Monday
next.
The oratorio of "The Redemption" Is
a wonderful work in many respects.
The boldness of its harmonies, the fresh
ness of melodic vein, the magnificence
of orchestration and its intense dra
matic feeling are all factors calculated
to captivate the popular heart. The
work was first produced at Birming
ham. England, under the direction of
the composer, August 30, 1882, and cre
ated a great sensation.
Missionaries in Danger.
London, Dec. 2. Great anxiety Is felt

THE ISEltTHOfEX SYnMOXT
To be Played at t!ie Concert Thursday
Afternoon.
One great advantage of a permanent
home orchestra Is that its hearers can
enjoy a systematic and continuous ren
dering of the great classlo master
pieces. Last winter Haydn and Mozart
were represented on the program of the
New Haven Symphony orchestra. At
the next concert the principal number
Is Beethoven's second symphony,
though not so famous as the fifth or
ninth, and being one of his earlier
works. This symphony ds one of very
great beauty. Its joyous and lively na
ture Is the more remarkable, as It was
composed in the year 1802, the same
year in which Beethoven wrote the re
markable letter known as "Beethoven's
Will," which refers to his deafness and
was written In one of those states of
depression under which the composer
often suffered.
The second symphony Is much great
er, bolder, broader than the first. Af
ter a spirited Introduction, of truly true
bass, the first movement begins.
The motive is given out in the baps
with violin accompaniment above, and
la soon followed by the second motive
In A.
'Neither Haydn nor Mozart could
have written anything so large in style,
so fresh in ideas and vivid in color.
In the beautiful slow movement
which follows the main theme in A Is
exquisitely worked out.
The scherzo which follows is the most
picturesque and striking part of the
symphony arid is attained by the extra
ordinary spirit and vigor of the music
by the constant sudden contrasts in
both amount and quality of sound and
chiefly by all kinds of unexpected
changes of key, such as arouse the at
tention and satisfy the taste. A start
is made in D, then we go to B flat, then
A. Then D again and then to F. Not
only the harmonies, but the melodies,
are wonderfully clear and easily re
membered. This abrupt change of key
and tone was a marked departure from
the me.thods of earlier composers "who
could not give their thoughts and emo
tions to the fire and natural ardor"
which distinguished Beethoven's ardent
and unrestrained musical nature of the
finale itself.
At the time it was written It was
nearly as astonishing as the scherzo,
for to people who had not heard the
finales of Beethoven's fourth, or sev
enth or eighth symphonies, this was the
most vigorous, abrupt and fiery compo
sition they had ever listened to. It
took them all by surprise and. made
them listen against their will, their aes
thetic judgment, sense of propriety and
everything else.
"But why talk of parts and move
ments? Who has time to think of them
while his ears are full of such delicious
sound? Even now, what can be newer
or more harmonious or pleasanter to
hear than the whole symphony? To this
very day, eighty years after its first ap
pearance, It is as fresh as ever in its in
domitable fiery flash and irreslsltible
strength." I.
