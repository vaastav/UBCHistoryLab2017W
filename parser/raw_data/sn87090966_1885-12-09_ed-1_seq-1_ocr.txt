THE END.
Tho Sutldou Death of William II.
Vandorbilt.
He Falls Forward Dead While Talking on
Business Alfalrs-Paralyilj the
Cause The Details.
Nmv Vobk, December . - Wllltimi II. .
Vnndrrbllt Is dead. Without n mo- !
meht's wnrnlng tho message came for ,
li I in, and he wns no more. Tho gill Iron
crossover the gn'e that leads lo the
grounds of the Itonuiu Cathollo Orphan
Asylum, on Finli Avenue, gleimed
brightly under the electric lamps to
night. Seen from the grand entrance of
the Vanderbllt mansion directly oppo
site, against the sombre grey ot the mar
ble cathedral, It was tho only clueriul
thing on Hie wide, deserted uvenue.
that seemed also stricken ns with sud
den death. The raya or Us brightness
were reflected In the windows of the
hugu brown stone pile, behind who-e
closed curtains one of the richest tip n In
the world lay (lend, stricken sudnei It
nnd without warning. The bus) hum
oftralUo and the noises of the street
were bushed In the block. Carriagi s
turned out and passers-by stopped lo en
quire if It was true that the millionaire
was dead, llelng told that they bad
heard aright, th-y went their nny, so
beted nnd silent, tarrying a minute to
gaze plteously on the huge stone pile.
Inside servants und Irlends tip-ton!
about, with grave nnd saddened fares.
The door bell was rung almost every
minute, and the wide portals swung
open lo admit other Irlends, who enmo
to mourn with those up-stalrs. The
drnwiicurtaliis of the millionaire's bed
room deadened tho sobs and tears of the
children of tbe dead, who were gathered
thereabout his corpse. None of them
bad been with hlui In the hour of hu
death. To none bad he had lime to
speak a word of farewell. As he lay
upon the carved bed In the Urge square
room, the windows of union overlook
the avenue, from the northeast lomir
of the south wing or the building to the
left of the main entrance, Mr. Vander
bllt looked as If he had fallen Into n
gentle sleep. His features were peace
ful and us natural as if be bad just ceased
talking and laid down to rest. His deulh
nau Deen as painless as u was suuuen.
Mr. Vanderbllt was always an early
riser. In his young days, when hu
worked his Staten Island tarui, It was
his custom to rise with the sun, and he
used to say In later lire that he trul
often arisen nt 3 o'cluek to go to
New York and return to Ids break
rust and his plow at 7. 01 lale
years ho has made It Ids practice to
leave his bed at 7 o'clock or not much
later, nnd throughout the Increasing Ill
health of the last two winters lie had
adhered to this practice. After rising
to-day he had held bis usual morning
conference with his eons, Cornelius nnil
William K who were the active man
agers of railroad properties, nnd niter
ward with Mr. K. V. liosslter. Ids pri
vate secretary, and treasurer of tho cw
York Central Jinllrond, to v. bom be en
trusted ft large share of the manage
ment of his private and business ntlnlrs.
ine conierences were nciu in jir, un
derbill's study on the ground Hour or
the mansion in the corner to tho left of
the main entrance from the avenue. It
was his favorite room where he wrote
and transacted nil bis business. During
the morning conference to-day lie had
been more than ordinarily alert, active,
so much so as to excite comment, to
which In a good-humored, Jocular vein,
he replied. He had eaten a good break
fast, and wns looking forward with
Eleasant anticipation to a ride up the
oulcvard with his son-in-law, Hamil
ton McK. Twombly, in tho afternoon.
At 11 o'clock be sent to the Grand Cen
tral Depot for his old-time friend,
Cbauncey M, Depew, President or the
New York Central itallroud, with u
message that he wished to seu lilm.
Mr. Depew Mas engaged In a conference
at the depot nnd sent word Hint ho
would not be able to come for un hour
or two, and Mr. Vanderbllt delayed the
appointment until 1 o'clock, and to oc
cupy tho Interval went Oown to tho
studio of J. G. A. Ward, the sculptor, In
West 62nd street, to sit for n bronze bust
of himself, which tho trustees ot the col
lege or physicians nnd surgeons wished
to place In the vestibule of the colli ge
for the erection or which he recently
gave $1,0UU,U00. He turned and took
lunch at 12:20 with his eon Ueorge, and
3ir. iromuiy. ai ine tauio no wus no
ticeably brlirht and cheerful. At 1
o'clock Mr. itobert Gatrett, the Presi
dent of the Baltimore and Ohio liallroud
Company, called upon -Mr. Depew at tbe
Grand Central Depot and finding him
still detained there, went up to Mr. Van
dcrbllt's house to Inform the millionaire
and take Mr. Depew's place. Mr. Van
derbllt greeted lilm cordially and en
gaged In u long and animated conversa
tion with lilm about railroad matters.
The conference lasted more than nn
hour and Mr. Vanderbllt sent word to
Mr. Twombly that he would be com
pelled to forego the Intended drive.
The two railroad magnates were dis
cussing the new terminal facilities or
the Ilaltlmore and Ohio and tbe new In
let Into the city It had secured by way
or Staten Island. Mr. Vunderbllt
showed a lively Interest in the results
that were to follow for the Island or his
birth from the new enterprise.
It was while tbe talk turned upon
this, tho scenes of his childhood and
early work contrasted with the tre
mendous achievements or bis old age,
Mr. Garrett sitting on tbe sofa and
racing the millionaire, who lolled for
ward In his arm chair as was bis habit
when thoroughly Interested, that the
President ef the llaltimoro and Ohio
was suddenly made aware or a slight
Indistinctness In Mr. Vanderbllt's
speech that grew into an Inarticulate
sound. Aa he leaned over to catch his
words Mr. Vanderbllt pitched forward
without n word of warning und fell
heavily on the floor on Ills face. Mr.
Oarrelt sprang to bis assistance with nn
exclamation of alarm, and seized a pil
low from the sofa and laid it under Ids
friend's head, then summoned Mrs.
Vanderbllt and Ueortre. the roundest
son. Messengers were sent In hasto for
physicians. One from the neighborhood
responded llrst, nnd was followed almost
Immediately by the family doctor, Dr.
james h. aicuean. oucn simple re
storatives ns were nt hand had been
applied, nut human aid was In vain.
Mr. Vanderbllt never spoke or moved '
after he fell under tho sudden stroke
und died within a few minutes without i
a struggle. To all Intents and pur
poses be was dead the instant lie
fell forward upon the floor. It was '
2:30 o'clock, when Dr. McLean led the '
stricken widow from the room where I
her husband bad sat planning and work- 1
Ing in the lull pride or health and
strength live minutes before. Dr. Mc- I
run pronounced bis death the result of 1
a sudden stroke of paralysis, due to the 1
bursting of n large blood vessel nt the '
base of the brain, of tho kind that are
absolutely Talal nt the moment. Me
suited mat Air. anuerbm s Heath was
ns painless as It was sudden. The doc-
lor know his patient most Intimately,
and promptly rerlllleil to the canto of
dinth to avoid the unnecessary formality
of a coroner's Inquest and nn autopsy.
As soon as II wa nscerlninrd liriond
doubt Hint Mr. Vanderbllt was dead, I tin
men servants were summoned nnd helped
lorarry the body of their dead master
iin stnlrs to the room lie had occupied In
mr. .Mrs. vaniierniii wus prosiruicii
with grief, and telephone messagts were
sent lo the Urnnd Central llepot to sum
mon her sons, and to the residence of
her sou-ln-lnw, to Inform them or the
bereavement. Cornelius, William K.
and Frederick W. Vandirbllt had been
together In the nlllce at tbe depot less
tlijin half an hour before llio menage
raiue, and had gone awar.
Mr, Cleveland's Policy.
The President's message delivered be
fore Congress yesterday Is not the brief
and concise document that the publlo
were led tu believe It would bo. He
louclxs a great many subjects and
leaves many of them practically undls
uiused. He makes few positive recom
mendations, and thoso that be makes
are not calculated to Increase his friends
among the western nnd southern dem
ocracy. One good recommendation Is
that the foreign consular service be
changed from notorial fees to lixed sala
ries for consuls to commercial agcnls.
Ills position on the coin question will
receive the strongest criticism from the
south nnd west, or the most extensive
consumption of crow will have to be In
dulged In that the country ever saw. On
finances Mr. Cleveland Is a stmon pure
Vnnkie. and in this hu dliplajs a moral
courage seldom equalled and never ex
celled. Ills position on civil service re
form Is llriu, bidding dellance fo the
spoils element of democracy, and he
would extent the power of the civil ser
vice reform coiumlslon Instead of cur
tailing It. InthlsquarterMr. Cleveland
will also nwnke un active opposition hs
many democrats nre true deolples or
Webb Flanlgan and say "what are wo
here for If It Isn't for the olllces."

Police Persecution,
Tho popular Idea Is that a police
force' Is for the security of life and prop
erty, but too often the police are used at
nn engine fur the grntlllcatlon of per
sonal spile. A case of this nature was
disposed of 111 the Itecorder's Court this
morning. On Saturday night Mr. Jose
Morln.a highly respectable citizen and
a native of this city, happened li be nt
Garronl's hall on private business, w hen
a dllllcully took place, and knowing the
man arrested to be ordinarily n peace
ableuian, he stepped In and attemnted
lo slop the disorder and ollcred to goorT
ine uonu. oi w prisoner: n here II Is
ordinarily the custom to tako a
responsible citizen's bond and re
lease the prisoner. In this oase
It was refused, and the man locked up
until the Marshal came. On Monday.Urf
hours after this matter occurred, Mr.
Morln was arrested for Interfering with
an olllccr. This morning he was tried,
and tunny unbiased and Impartial lis
tener It was patent that tbeolllcers, four
In number, two or whom were sanitary
and one n pound olllccr, took llilsmelho.l

A Quick Wilted Horse,
Yesterday afternoon a hack was pass
ing down Avenue (,' nt a rapid gait, and
when near tho Firn Company No. 2'a
bouse, the driver struck one or the
horses with the whip. Doth nt once
plunired forward, when the lues
dropped and the driver was powerless
in control mem. At mat point Mrs. w.
I.. inter was drlvlnir alone-, onlr
a few steps from the hack when the
horses commenced to run. but be Torn she
could pull on tho lines, her horse gavo
one ueroio leap nnu ucpositeuino uiiggy
safely on the sidewalk just as the, hack
scraped the hub of one bind wheel. The
nacK team was stopped rurther down
tho street without doing nny other dam-
ago. It was a nnrrow escape for all con
cerned, but the buggy horse was the
least exciteu oi any, anu Ills great
strength and good ernso was duly
appreciated, nnd shows that ho under
stood the situation at a glance and did
his duly without any urging or excite
ment. A Brutal Father.
Ollicer Zlegle'r was called yesterday
by telephone, to arrest nn Kngllihmnn
named Henry Green, living on Deltcl
street. Second Ward, who was beating
and striking his LVyear old daughter.
Tho olllccr urrested Green, and the case
wns continued by the ltcoorder this
morning to procuro tbe attendance In
court or tbo girl. The ollicer states
mat urecn nau ordered his daughter to
perform some trifling' servlco for him,
and because she was too slow about It,
he beat her terribly about the head and
fare, until her cries attracted the neigh-
oors.
Persistent Passengers,
Oillcer Hcltgen arrested two able
bodied young meu yesterday afternoon
at tho International and Great Northern
depot for being vagrants, They gave
ineir iiumea as aiwooii r.mmons anu
Waller Weston, nnd claimed to be seek
ing work. The conductor of the train
by which they arrived In the city stated
to the oftlcer that these two men had
been repeatedly put oh the train on the
way to San Antonio, and that when tbe
train started they would get under tho
train nnd ride upon the axle of the
trucks. They were lined $5 or 10 days
Look Out For Tramps.
There are ti large number of tramps
about town, and they visit houses on one
pretext or another to call attention or
its Inmates for the purpose of taking
notes oi ine a iuauori in oruer to Dur
glarlze the same. Look out for them.
Under no ciroumstanccs parley with
them, nnd If possible Immediately notify
the police nnd have them arrested.
There Is no good excuso ' for an
able bodied man doing anything except
honest, legitimate work, and anv one
doing otherwise Is a suspicious character.
