Catarrh
I S a blood disease. Until tne poison la
1 expelled from tho system, thero can
bo no euro for this loatlisomo and
tlangcrous malady. Therefore, the only
effective treatment Is n thorough conrso
of Aj cr's Snrsnparllln tho best of all
blood purifiers. The sooner you begin
the better j delay is dangerous.
"I was troubled with catarrh for over
two years. I tried various remedies,
and was treated by a number of physi
cians, but received no benefit until I
began to take Ayer's Sarsaparilla. A
Jew bottles of this medicine cured ino of
this troublesome complaint and com
fletely restored my bcalth."-Jesso it.
Hoggs, Ilolinan's Mills, N. 0.
"When Ayer's Sarsaparilla was rec
ommended to mo for catarrh, I was In
clined to doubt its offlency. Ilavinr
tried so many remodles, with llttlo ben
oflt, I had no faith thafnnythlng would
euro mo. I became emaciated from loss
pf appetite and Impaired digestion. I
had nearly lost tho senso of smell, and
tny system waa badly deranged. I was
about discouraged, when n friend urged
mo to try Ayer's Sarsaparilla, and re
ferred mo to persons whom It had cured
of catarrh. After taking half a dozen
bottles of this medicine, lam convinced
that tho only sure way of treating this
obstinate dlseaso Is through tho blood."

O'Connor, T. D. Sullivan and T. P. QUI,
hare decided to join in the demand of
those of their colleagues in Ireland who
call on Parnell to retire from the leader
ship' ot the Irish people. Their decision
Vras embodied in a manifesto, which waa
cabled last night to Justin McCarthy, iu
Vice chairman of the Irish parliamentary
party. The decision will be placed before
the meeting of the Irish members to be
held In London this afternoon. Timothy
Harrtbgton Is the only one of the delegates
to stand by Parnell. The fact of O'llrlen
and Dillon Joining the opposition to Par
nell practically settles, according to men
competent to Judgp, the oU of the Irish
party to lie taken today on the question of
the Irish leadership.
The Irlih DeletaUi' Manlfeito.
To Justin McCarthy, M. I., Tie chairman of the
Irleh parliamentary party:
Our sense of the matchlAss genius of Mr. Tar
nell as a loader, of the Imperishable serrlCM he
has rendered to the Irish cause, of the courage,
Integrity and splendid success with which ha has
led our people (or ten years and the tie of com
radeship and personal respect and affection which
for years bound us to him, hare made us suspend
to the latest possible moment our judgment
against his further leadership. The obligation to
express Judgment Is to all of us the most palntul
duty of our Htcs. No earthly consideration could
have mored us to our determination except the
solemn conrlctlon that we are drlren to choose
between Mr. I'arnell and the destruction of our
country's cause. So painfully (dire were we to
all that might be InTolred In the loan of such a
leader that we eagerly co-operate with our col
leagues tn erery effort to retain his Influence In
our councils.
The manifesto which llr. tarnnll hxi
Issued cuts us off from the last hopes to which
we clung. Anxious to arold any word that might
embitter the controreny, we shall not dwell upon
the cruel Injustice with which he treat the mem
bers of the party that has followed him 1th a
loyalty and affection such as no leader erer ex
perienced before.
His recollection of this fealty to him In many
an hour of trial might well hare saTed them the
Imputation that any section of them could hare
allowed their Integrity to bo sapped by Liberal
wirepullers, nor would we do more than enter a
protest against this Tlolatlon of all constitutional
principle in flouting by anticipation the decision
of the elected representatlYea of the people, from
whose Totes the chairman of the parliamentary
party receives his authority, and rertlng to a
rague general appeal orer their heads.
Heckles, and Unjmt Imputations.
Considerations like these we should readily
hare waived In the interest of national solidarity;
but the method In which. Ignoring the origin of
the preeent calamitous situation, Mr. rarnell en
deavors to fasten the res ponsibtllty for It upon
Messrs. Oladstone and 11 or ley, compels us to dis
sociate ourselves In the strongest manner from
Imputations which we believe to be reckleas and
unjust. We view with abhorrence the attacks
that have been made on Mr. Parnell by his public
and private enemies under cover of bis present
difficulties. To attacks ot this kind, eddreued
to a man of strong and proud spirit, we attribute
many of the terrible dangers with which Ireland
la now threatened, and wo fear that they might
do the further mischief sf diverting the minds of
many people from grave national to purely per
sonal Issues In the natural resentment of an un
generous attack on a great leader In an hour of
stress and disaster; but, while making every pos
sible allowance for Mr. Parnell's feelings on this
score, we consider it unjust to the English peo
ple, and lamentable from the point of View of
International good feeling, to describe as English
wolves bowUng for his destruction those who
have not been able to bring themselves to the
same view to which gratitude and the necessity
for union Impelled Mr. Parnell's own colleagues
and countrymen.
Wnrm Support of dlad.tone.
The plea of Mr. Farnell that Mr. Gladstone's
letter involves a claim to dictate to the Irish
party and thereby strike at the Independence of
that party as a atrlctly Irish national body Is
one calculated to Inspire every Irish Nationalist
with alarm If that plea were not an obvious fal
lacy. The Irish party was formed with the pur
pose of winning home rule for Ireland, and any
Interference In the interest of English parties
would be an Invasion of the Independence of the
Irish party, and, would, we believe, be repelled
by no one more sternly than by our colleagues
and ourselves who are In opposition to Mr. Par
nell. But the very basis of our Independent alli
ance with the Liberal party Is the adoption by
them of the programmo for which the Irish party
was formed and the recognition that It must be
the first attack of a Liberal cabinet to realize that
programme. Whatever differences of opinion
may exist as to the haste with which Mr. a lad
stone's letter was communicated to the public. It
was obviously not his hostility to home rule, but
his earnest desire to save it from disaster that
prompted Mr, Gladstone to write his letter,
Qladstone'a Alleged Treachery.
We deplore that the difficulties of Mr. Glad
stone's position were not frankly recognised by
Mr. Parneli, and that, on the contrary, friendly
private communications communications obvi
ously mane with a view of smoothing toe passage
of the home rule bill, have been made the basis
of insinuations of treachery to the Irish cause.
By his conviction again and again expressed that
home rule to be effective must be such a meas
ure as will satisfy the Irish people, Mr. Gladstone
Is bound to give a full and ample measure of self
government to Ireland. To offer any other
scheme would not only be an act of Incredible
baseness but of Incredible (oily, and we emphatic
ally separate ourselves from any such charge
against lit. Gladstone.
Their Ilellef In Mr. Morlex.
We think It deplorable that Mr. Morley's sug
gestion that some of the Irish party would co
operate In carrying out the Irish programme of
the Liberal Home llule party, would be so
strangely Interpreted by Mr. Parnell. Every
member of the Irish party will of course agree
with Mr. I'arnell that the acceptance by any
Nationalist member of office from on English
ministry would be a breach of the elementary
principle upon which our party is founded.
But nobody who kuowa Mr. Morley's character
will doubt that the suggestion was made in the
honest belief that a Liberal ministry would be
helped In the difficult work of carrying through
the details ot an Irish home ruin hill by the co
operation ot Irish colleagues, and it was not an
Inslduous attempt on the Integrity and Independ
ence ot the Irish party.
rumen's Hash and Fatal Path.
We have now to confront the statement that
Mr. Parnell's leadership opens an Impassable
gulf between the representatives of Ireland and
toe Liberal party who have ralthtully observed
their part of their side of the agreements as to
the national claims ot Ireland, and the situation
la aggravated by deplorable expressions ( 111
will toward the British people who have again
aud again within the past Ave yean manifested
their determination to do justice to Ireland, and'
have by their votes paralysed the arm of coer
cion. In deliberately bringing things to this
position Hr. farnell has entered upon a rash and
fatal path upon which every consideration of
Ireland's, safety, as well as of personal honor,
forbid us absolutely to follow him. In the future
of a party thus Isolated and discredited we can
not Imagine how any Irishman can see anything
but destruction of the hopes ot self government,
happiness and peace which but a few weeks ago
were on the point ot being reahxed for our peo
ple, so tried by many years of sacrifices and suf
fering. What llr. Parnell asks us to do, stripped of all
tUelssuee, Is to sacrifice all the hopes ot an
early settlement of UieTriih sifuggl. to his reso
lution to maintain his personal position. We an
driven to choose between our leader and our
cause. In that sad choice we cannot hesitate.
We lay these views before all our colleagues ot
the Irish parliamentary party la the earnest be
lief that a decisive vote on their part will de
liver Ireland from the fearful anxiety that now
overhangs her people. We are convinced that a
calm but resolute course ot action on our part In
this cruel emergency will redound to the ad
vantage of our cause by furnishing conclusive
testimony of the capacity of our party and of
our people for self government. We cannot re
linquish Uie hope that In the face of such deci
sive action by the elective representatives ot the
Irish people Mr. raroell's sense of patriotism
will withhold him from plunging Ireland Into
thoe. horrors of dissension which have so often
already In her tragic and unhappy history robbed
her ot liberty at the momal It was within her
grasp, and will save blm from undoing In on
passionate hour the results ot all nls incompar
able services to his country.
The manifesto is signed by John Dillon,
William O'llrlen, Thomas O'Connor, T, D.
Balllvsu, and Thoma P. Gill.

Dot th. majority settle th matter by a

not only to preside but to show the most
outrageous Unfairness in presiding." flood

fectly regular for the member opposed to

this is not done, however, Is that It would
hay the appearance of irregularity, no
matter how regular It might really be, and
this fact would be used in Mr. Parnell's
favor among th. more Ignorant portions
of the Irish constituencies. And it must
be remembered tbnt ho matter what the
meetings in London may decide, tho final
decision rests with the Irish people. Par
nell does not care what the present mem
ber do in his case.
Successful Fight for Delay.
At yesterday's meeting Parnell and his
friends continued their battle for delay so
very successfully that all hope of settling
the question during the day waa aban
doned. During the progress of the after
noon's session a sharp controversy arose
between the members present concerning
the uso of cable dispatches for the purpose
of influencing the mluds of the American
delegates. Mr. Kenny admitted having
cabled his own views on the questions at
Issue to his own colleagues In America.
Mr. O'Kelly declared that whatever th.
action of tho meeting to-night might be,
the question would not be decided at
Westminster. The decision ought not to
be hurried. It waa boat to give the country
time to think, Mr. Nolan's Amendment
that the question be postponed to a future
meeting at Dublin was, however, rejected
by a vote of ai to 41. Mr. A. O'Connor ad
vised Mr. Parnell to withdraw, as it was
impossible for him henceforth to be tho
leader. Mr. Jordan, of Clare, accused Mr,
Parneli ot sacrificing the cause of the na
tion to his insensate pride and culpable
ambition. At C p. m. the meeting adjourn
ed for one hour. Ill the course of the meet'
ing Mr. Parnell attacked Mr. Barry and
others for sending cablegrams to America
and trying to Influence the delegates there.
Thomas Sexton's Defense.
Mr. Sexton replied that he had received
a cablegram from Mr. O'Connor request
ing him to give his views on the situation
and he did not feel that the mero fact of
distance entitled him to refuse tho request
lie therefore cabled Mr. O'Connor, inform
ing him that a majority favored Mr. Par
nell's retirement. He further cabled that
if the envoys saw auy way to support the
majority substantial unanimity would be
secured.
Col. Nolan said that Mr. Sexton ought
to withdraw this expression ot opinion
from the telegram, for he must now see
that unanimity does not follow from the
American delegates voting against Mr.
Parnell.
Mr. T. Uealy What's all this discussion
aboutf It seems to be another piece of
pure obstruction.
Mr. Parnell That is a most insolent
and impertinent observation. (Cheers.)
Mr. Barry attempted to speak, but Mr.
Parnell ordered him to sit down
Mr. W. Redmond If any names were
sent to the delegates in America all the
name on each side ought to have been
given. I hear that the telegram from the
delegates waa read by certain Irish mem

with cheers. If Mr. Parnell la to be de

making it a matter of cheering in an En

An English Alliance Necessary.
M. J. Kenny declared that It would b.
impossible to obtain home rule without
an alliance with an English party, II.
strongly objected to subordinating Irish
Interests to any particular man. He bad
little hope for the Irish party if it depended
upon the chairman to save them from
the chicanery of nny English statesman!
The Irish looked to their representatives
in parliament, not to Mr. Parnell, for sal-,
vatlon. Xavler Brown said they had had
HUle leadership from Mr. Parnell In re
cent years. After the divorce rait he
(Brown) had come to the conclusion that
Mr. Parnell's continuance In the leader
ship would be an intolerable disgrace.
Mr. E. Harrington Why didn't you eay
so at the timer This ought to be stopped.
Mr. Parnell Let him go on.
Mr. O'Brien bitterly reproached Mi.
Parnell for his course In regard to the
Hawarden Interview, There were angry
retort from Mr. Parnell'a supporters.
Mr. Parnell himself denied that he had
said that Mr, Gladstone was false. Mr.
O'Brien concluded; "I leave you (Parnell)
to convince the Irish people of the honesty
ot your part in that grave matter."

A FRIGHTFUL EXPLOSION.
Four Men Killed by the Wowing Up ot

BloousBtmo, Pa., Dea S. Berwick was
the scene of a shocking boiler explosion
yesterday. "Four men were killed, and a
sawmill plant, including the stable and
surrounding buildings, was burned. The
accident occurred at 1 o'clock, when a great
outburst of steam at Adams' sawmill was
followed by a terrific report Crowds of
people at onoe hurried to the scene. Noth

four Inhabitants were strewn about the
woods dead.
Ira Oruver, one of the employes, was
found about fifty feet from where the
boiler houae stood, horribly mangled.
Ills brother was found in another direc

OCALA. Fla., Dec. a About 1,200 person,
attended th. meeting ot th. National
Farmers' Alliance last evening. Chair
man Itogere Introduced President Polk,
who delivered his annual address. He
aid in part: "Profoundly Impressed with
the magnitude of this great revolution for
reform, Involving issues momentous and
stupendous in their character, as affectlug
the present and future welfare of the
people, the pnbllo mind is naturally di
rected to this meeting with anxious inter
est, it not solicitude, and you cannot be
unmindful of the importance and responsi
bility that attach to your action."
Degradation of the American Parmer.
He then congratulated the alliance on
its achievements, and, reviewing the cansss
of agricultural depression, declared that
It was .an anomaly to the student of in
dustrial progress.
"Retrogression in American agricult
ure," he said, "means national decay, and
powerful and promising as Is this giant
republic, yet Its power and glory touch not
the degradation of the American farmer."
The alarm incident to centralization of the
money power and upbuilding of monopo
lies was then pointed out, and both polit
ical parties were condemned for forcing
aud encouraging this condition. lie urged
that additional organizers be sent at once
to Oregon, Washington, Ohio, New York,
New Jersey and other states.
The National Legt.latare.
Among th. recommendations was one
that an organisation be formed to b.
known as the National Legislature, com
posed of th. national president and the
presidents of all state allianoes, their duty
being td look after legislative reforms de
manded by the alliance, both in state leg
islation and congress. He deprecated sec
tionalism, and closed veith an eloquent ap
peal for national harmony.
Doth Kyea on Coagress.
In relation to the political action of the
alliance, he aald that while tbe order is pc--1!
Ileal, it cannot be partisan or sectional in
IU action. In support of this declaration
be pointed to the record f the alliance in
the recent popular election, and particu
larly to th. noble and patrtotf. bearing of
the brotherhood to Kansas and South Caro
lina. In regard to the record of th. alli
ance during th. wast year, and especially
with reference to Use legislation demanded
by It, Mr. Polk ieoiacad that congress had
persistently Ignore-:, aft of their proposi
tions, notably rat i case f th. measure
known as the sub-tress my bill. "Con
gress," he said, "moat come nearer to the
people or they win get nearer to congress."

Clear and Explicit Statements In Regard
to Sliver Coinage and the Agricultural
Interests Very Hopeful View of Indus
trial Affairs Generally,
WAsnreoTON, Dec. 1. Following are the
important statements and auggestions in
President Harrison's message to the Fifty
first congress at the opening of its second
session. After the usual congratulations
and calling attention -to the reports of the
department officials, the president details
the results of the Pan-American congress
and our diplomatic relations with other
countries, especially with the new republic
of Brazil. The short war in Central
America was hastened to a conclusion by
the friendly intervention' of the United
States. Further he says:
The killing of den. Barrundla on board the ra
dio mall steamer Acapulco, while anchored In
transit in tbe port of Ban Jose ds Guatemala, de
manded careful infjulry. Having failed in a revo
lutionary attempt to Invade Guatemala from
Mexican territory, Oen. Darruntua took passage
at Acapulco for Panama. Th. consent of tbe
representatives of the United States was sought
to effect his selsure, Unit at Charaperico, where
the steamer touched, and afterward at Ban Jose.
The captain of tbe steamer refused to give up his
passenger without a written order from the
United States minister; the latter furnished the
desired letter, stipulating as the condition of his
action that Oen. BurrundlA's life should be spared,
and that be should be Uied only for offenses
growing out of his Insurrectionary movements.
This letter was produced to tbe captain of the
Acapulco-by the military commander at San Jom,
as hi warrant to take the passenger from th.
steamer. Oen. Barrundla resisted capture and
was killed. It being evident that the minister,
Mr. MUner, had exceeded tbe bounds of his au
thority In Interveni.g, in compliance with the de
mands of the Ouetemaiaa authorities, to author
ise and effect. In violation of precedent; the sele
ure on a vessel of toe United States of a passenger
ta transit charged with poHUcal'offensos, In order
that be might be tried for such offenses under
what was described as martial law, I was coo
strained to disavow Mr, Mlxner'e aet and recall
him from his post.
In pursuance of the ooaenrrent resolution of
Oct. 1, tt0, 1 have proposed to tbe governments
of Meiico'and Great Britain to consider a conven

The revenues of the government from all sources
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1800. were f 463,

period were $.1i8,eiS,l.tJ. The portal receipts
have not heretofore lieen Included In the state
ment of these OHgregatea, and for the purport of
eompertwn the sum of tM,tm,097.W should be de
ducted from both sides of the account The sur
plus for the year, Including the amount applied to
the sinking fund, was J108,S4Mri.Oi The receipts
for 1M0 were tl,(rW.K3.T9, and (he expenditures
Ms,730,er In excess of those of 1889. The cus
toms receipts Increased S,8SS,t.fH, and the re
ceipts from internal revenue ttl.S,ll.l, while
on the side of expenditures that for penskma was
$19,31 3,075.09 In exoeas of the preceding year.
The treasury statement for tbe current flsc-il
yearpartly actual aud partly estimated. Is as
follows! Receipts from all sources, HOrJ.000,000;
total expenditures, HM.000,000, leaving a surplus
of lS2,nu0,0fJ0-not taking the xtal receipts Into
the account on either aide. The loss of revenu.
from customs for the last quarter la estimated at
IU.000,000, but from this ta deducted a gain of
about 119,000,000, realised during the first four
months of the year.
For the year 1803 the total estimated receipts
sre H73,(oo,0, and the estimated expenditure.
V7,853,a.U, leaving an estimated surplus of
(lM47,7W.6rl, which, with a cash balance or
000,000 at Ore hefrlnnlng of the year, will give
M7,t7,"0O.CS as the sum available for the redemp

estimates of receipts and expenditures for the
Posiofltce department, being equal, are not In

The act "directing the purchase of silver bullion
and tlui Imiia rtf trMun nr., 1 1 m ...
proved Jnly 14. 1800, has bwen administered by I
the secretary of the treasury with an earnest pur
pose to get Into circulation at the earliest poulble
dates the full monthly amounts of treasury notes
contemplated by Its provisions and at tbe same
time to give to the market for silver bullion such
support as tbe law contemplates. The recent de
preciation In tiro price of silver has been observed
with regret. The rapid rise In price which antici
pated and followed the passage of the act was In
fluenced In some degree by speculation, and the
recent reaction ta tn part the result of the samo
cause and in part Of the recent monetary disturb
ances. Some months of f urtber trial will be neces
sary to determine the permanent effect of the re
cent legislation upon sliver values, but It Is grati
fying to know that tbe Increased circulation se
cured by the act has exerted and will continue to
exert a most beneficial influence upou business
and upon general values.
While It has not been thought best to renew
formally the suggestion of an International con
ference looking to an agreement touohlng tbe
full use of silver for coinage at a uniform ratio,
care has been taken to observe closely any
change In tire situation abroad, and no favorable
opportunity will be lost to promote a result which
It Is confidently believed would confer very large
benefits upon the commerce of tbe world.
The recent monetary disturbances In England
are not unlikely to suggest a re-examlnatlon of
opinions upon this subject. Our very large sup
ply of gold will. It not lost by Impulsive legisla
tion In the supposed Interest of sliver, give us a
position of advantage In promoting a permanent
and safe international agreement for tbe free use
of silver as a coin metal. The increase of
money In circulation durlug the nineteen months
has been In the aggregate t93,8fW,61S, or about
$1.60 per capita, and of this Increase only $7,100,
000 was due to the recent silver legislation. That
this substantial and needed aid given to com
merce resulted In an enormous reduction of tho
public debt and of tho annual Interest charge Is
matter of Increased satisfaction. There have
been purchased and redeemed since March 4,
WHO, 4 and 4H per cent, bonds to the amount of
$1,8S,4M, at a cost ot M0,G2O,?41, resulting tn
Um reduction ot tire annual Interest charge of
H,ror,CO0, and a total Baving of Interest ot $51,
570,700. I notice with great pleasure the statement ot
the secretary that the receipts from Internal reve
nue he Increased during the last fiscal year
nearly $12,000,000, and that tne cost of collecting
mis larger revenue was lees by $90,017 than for
the some purpose in the preceding year. Tho
percentage of cost of collecting the customs reve
nue was less for the last fiscal year than ever be
fore. The morale of the army has been so greatly
Improved that desertions have decreased one
third. The pension office administration has been
bo Improved that all new cauee are examined and
adjusted rapidly, drearer appropriations for
coast defenses are asked. The now navy lias
made very gratifying progress. Since March 4,
1880, nine new vessels have been put in commis
sion, and during this winter four more. Including
one monitor, will be added. The construction of
the other vessels authorized Is being pu&hed, both
in government and private yards, with energy
and watched with the most scrupulous care.
About 14,720,000 acres have been bought of the
Indians during the year. The monthly Issue of
patents for lands to actual settlers has Increased
about 6.000, The disability pension act has been
put In force very rapidly; but this enlargement
of tire general law should suggcet a more care
ful scrutiny of bills for special relief, both as
to the coses where relief is granted and as to the
amount allowed.
The situation of the farmers has greatly Im
proved, especially by a general advance In the
price of their products. The export trade In live
animals and fowls shows a very large Increase;
the total value ot such exports for the year end
ing June 30, 1800, was $33,000,000, and the Increase
over the preceding year was over $15,000,000.
Nearly 200,000 more cattle and over 45,000 more
hogs were exported than In the preceding year.
The export trade In boef and pork products and
In dairy products was very largely increased, the
mcrcA&e in the article of butter alone being from
18,504,078 pounds to !!D,711,OU pounds, and the
total Increase In the value of meat and dairy
product exported being $31,000,000. This trade,
so directly helpful to tbe farmer. It ta believed
will bo yet further and very largely Increased
when the system of Inspection and sanitary super
vision now provided by law Is brought fully into
oierutlon.
The efforts of tho secretary to esbtblUh tbe
healthfulnesa of our meats against tire disparag
ing Imputations that have been put upon them
abroad have resulted In substantial progress.
Veterinary surgeons sent out by tbe department
are now allowed to participate in the Inspection
of the live cattle from this country landed at the
English docks, and during the several months
they have beeu on duty no caue ot pleuro-pneu-monla
has been reported. This inspection abroad,
and the domestic Inspection of live animals And
pork products, provided for by tbe act of Aug.
SO, ISA), will afford as perfect a guarantee for tbe
wbolesomenehs ot our meats offerud for foreign
consumption as is anywhere given to any food
product, and Its non-acceptance will quite clearly
reveal the real motive of any continued restric
tion of their use; and, that having been made
clear, the duty of the executive will be very plain.
Beet sugar is demonstrated to he a perfect suc
cess, and the area of Its possible production very
large,
Tbe civil service law Is executed with fidelity
and Impartiality, and the president points with
pride to the fact that not a single case of defalca
tion or embeztlement has occurred during tbe
year. The country Is congratulated on tho good
work done by congress, and the prediction Is eon
Bdenlly made that tbe new laws wBi iusura more
regular employment and better wrjeus. Tbe
president asserts that the general trade and In
dustrial conditions throughout tbe country
during the year have shown a marked Im
provement. Kor puny years prior to tSM the
merchandise balances of foreign trade had
bsen largely In our favor, but daring that
year and the year following they turned
against us. H is very gratifying to know that tbe
hut nscol year again shows a balance In oer favor
of over $00,000,000. The bauk clearings, which
furnish a good test of the votatuoof buslnees
transacted, for the first tea months of tbe year
1800 show, as compared with the same months of
18d3, an increase for the whole country of about
8.4 per oent., while the Increase outside ot the city
of New York was over 18 per cent.
Tbe value ot our exports of domestlo merchan
dise during the last year was over $115,000,000
greater than the preceding year, and was only
exceeded once in our history. About $100,000,000
of this excess waa In agricultural products. Tho
production of pig iron always a good gauge est
general prosperity Is snown by a recent census
bulletin to have been 153 per cent, greater In 1800
Uian m 18X0, and the production ot steel SOU per
cent, greater. Mining in coal has bad no limita
tion except that rasultlng f ram deficient trans
portation, Tbe general Ustlmony is that tabor
ts everywhere fully employed, and the reporta
for the last year show a smaller number of em
ployes affected by strikes and lockouts than in
any year since 181. The depression In the priov
of agricultural products has been greatly relieved
and a buoyant and hopeful tone was beginning to
be felt by all our people until checked by recent
monetary events In England. The apprehension
tnat our tariff may again and at once be subjected
to Important general changes would undoubtedly
add a depressing Influence- ot the most serious
character.
The general tariff aet has only partially gone
Into operation, some of Its Important prorUlons
being limited to take effect at dates yrt In the
future. Tbe general provisions ot tbe law have
been In force lees thsn sixty days.. Its permanent
effects upon trade and prices still largely stand In
conjecture. It is curious to note that the advanoo
tn tire prices of articles wholly unaffected by the
tariff act was by many hastily ascribed to that
act. Notice was not taken of the fact that the
general tendency of tbe market waa upward
froin Influences wholly apart front the recent
tariff legislation. The eolargemwnt of our eor
rency by the sliver bill undoubtedly gave an up
ward teodeney to trade ai.1 had a marked eiTtxa
era prloee; but Uds natural and desired effect ttf
the silver legislation was by many arroneoualy at
tributed to tire tariff act.
There ta neither wisdom nor Justice la she sug
gestion thst the subject tariff revliion shall be
again opened beore this law has had a fair trial.
Already we begin to hear (rout abroad end
from our custom houses that the prohibitory ef
fect upon importations imputed to the ac ta
not juitlfled. The hniorts at the port of
N.w York for the first thro weeks of November
were nearly 8 per cent, greater than for tbe aaine

The criticisms of th. bill that hav. coma to in
from foreign sources may well be rejected for re
puansncy. If these critics really tmllere that the
edoiitlon by lis of a free trad policy, or of tarilt
ratee hav Inrr reference solely to revenue, would
diminish the participation of their own countries
In the commerce of the world, their adweoey and
promotion by speech and other forma of organ

Is a rare exhibition of umeUlahnriis In traao
And on the other hand. If tbey slocerHy behave
that tho adoption of a protective tariff trolley by
this country Inure, to their profit and our hurt. It
Is noticeably strange that they should lead tho
outcry against the authors of a policy so helpful
to their countrymen, and crown with their favor
those who would snatch from them a siihatsntlal
share of a trade with other lands already Inade
quate to their necessities.
There Is no disposition among any of our people
to promote prohibitory or retaliatory legislation.
Our policies are adopted not to tlie hurt of others,
but to seciira for cursetrm those advantages that
fairly grow out of our favored position as a na
tion. Our form of government, with Its Incident
of universal surTrsire, makes It Imiwrstive Urnt we
shall aave our working people, from tire agitations
and distresses which scant work and wages that
have no margin for comfort always beget. Hut
after all this is done It will lie found that our
markets are open t friendly commercial ex
changee of enormous value to the otbe r great
powers.
The president then makes an elaborate
defense of th. reciprocity clauses in the
McKlnley bill, and urges congress to pro
ceed without delay to pass tho appropria
tion bills and n bill for apportioning mem
bers under the census of 1890. Increased
subsidies for now steamship lines are too

Forcing the Federal Klertlon. mil.
WAsniKQTON, Dec. 3. The deoislve ac
tion of the senate in taking up the federal
elections bill for consideration by an un
broken party voto lends a strong color of
probability to the statement made by the
friends of the bill that It will be passed.
Still more significant is this statement
made to the United Press by a Republican
senator who was strongly opposed to tba
elections bill three months ago, and who
was reckoned among those who would
bolt tne Republican caucus on a proposi
tion to change the senate rules and estab
lish the previous question:
"I think the bill will pass," ha said.
"The two new senators from Wyoming,
added to the two from Idaho, will give the
friends ot the elections bill enough strength
on the Republican shlo to change tbe rnles
and pass the bill, and when it is evident
that tbe bill can be passed very few Re
publicans will stand out against caucus
action.
"Tbe proposition to change tbe rules will
not bo brought In until It seems evident
to the Republicans that the Democratta
senators intend to obstruct th passage of
the bill."
A Democratic caucus will 1m held soon
to determine party policy on tbe subject of
tbe bill.
The senate passed a resolution asking
the secretary of war for information about
the steps taken to disarm Indians in Ne
braska, South Dakota and North Dakota;
also a resolution instructing the foreign
relations committee to inquire into the ad
visability of authorizing a cable to Hawaii.
Several minor meaenres were passed, and
the senate by n: party vote 11 to 30 took
up the federal elections bill. At a o'clock,
by another party vote, tho senato laid aside
the unfinished business aud continued the
reading of the bill. At the conclusion ot
1
in reading the senate adjourned.
