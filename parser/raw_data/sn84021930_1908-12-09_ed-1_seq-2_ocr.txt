Tbe tenth birthday of the News has
called forth numerous comments by
the press of Alaska. Here are two of
them which don't seem to agree:
The Douglas Island News says that ;
it is teu years old. There must be some
mistake. Most of the stuff that appears
in it is older than that. ? Juneau Daily
Record.
The Douglas Island News with its is- j
sue of last week completed its tenth
year of labor in its Held. Iu making
brief commeut upou it the News speaks
of certain proportions of success and ;
failure, of happiness aud of Sorrow,;
triumphs and mistakes that make up
the record of that labor. Because of
standards, ideals aud ambitions which
each man establishes for himself in
life, and because results may not
measure up at all times to these in his
eyes? things which other meu who have
only the outward view know nothing of
? these are features of the life of every
man that strives. But to those of the
the outward view there has been noth- j
ing but success and good works in the
story of the Douglas News. Aud this
is a good deal to say with sincei ity. !
Good luck and loug life to it. ? Skag
way Daily Alaskau.
President Roosevelt's message to j
congress makes no mention of terri- !
torial government for Alaska. What j
will Billy do?
