Tlie President's Message.
President Cleveland's first message to
the Congress of the L nited States was de
livered on Tuesday. We can only give ai
synopsis of the principal features of the |
very lengthy document.
A fitting tribute is paid to the memory,
public service and virtues of Vice Presi- !
dent Hendricks. Relations with foreign:
powers continue friendly. 1 he Argentine ;
Republic has revived a claim against th;~
governmeut based on tbe breaking up of a
colony of that country on Falkland Islands
in 1631. which led to their occupation by
the British two years later—a claim which
which the president regards as wholly
groundless. The rejection by Austria of
A. M. Keilv. appointed minister to that
court, is referred to as having been due to
a religious objection which the president
could not entertain, the L nited States be
ing a country of religious equalitj. 1 he
friendly offices of this government in pro
moting peace among the Central American
states is mentioned; also the protection
afforded American property in Colombia
dining the late insurrection in that coun
try. The Colombian government has
agreed to negotiate the claims of Amer
ican citizens for losses sustained at the
hands of the insurgents. The Nicaraguan
canal and the Tehuantepec ship railway
are referred to at length and the latte:
scheme is commended. But President
Cleveland distinctly disapproves of this
government having anything to do with
either project. He thinks our histoiicai
policy as well as our best interests forbid
the acquisition of national property remote
from our own boundaries, especially w hen
that property is to he an international high
way of commerce. But he also objects to
any other nation acquiring any control oi
such a highway. In his opinion the
United. States government should see to it
that the canal or ship railway when built
be maintained in a condition of strict neu
trality, secure to the use of all mankind
and free from the exclusive or partial con
trol of any uatioa. Negotiations are afoot
for a claims convention with Chili to arbi
trate the losses of citizens of this country
sustained during the occupation by Chili
of Peru and Bolivia. The anti-Chinese
demonstrations and riots are severely depre
cated because it is the duty of this govern
ment to protect the Cliiuese in this coun
trv ; but the president says he is ready t<
consider further legislation to restrict
Chinese immigration if the present law.
are considered inadequate, lhe lact that
our delegates to the Congo conference
signed the agreement in relation to Cong«
contrary to instructions is detailed; the
provisions of the agreement were not to
be binding on any signatory government
unless ratified by such government in one
year and the senate will not be asked to
ratify the work of our over-officious dele
gates. Cort-a is now one of the treaty
powers of the l nited States anil has a>kew
for military instructors from this country,
a request which President Cleveland re
gards with favor as do Japan and China,
Corea's nearest and most closely related
neighbors. The difficulty with Ecuadoi
over Julios Santos, an American citizt-i,
imprisoned without cause iu ttiat country.
was settled by his release on demand.
France has been paid the amount of hei
claim for damages sustained by her citi
zens in the late war. It is hoped that the
policy of Germany toward our naturalize«.
German subjects visiting the mother coun
try will be shortly modified. France
shows a disposition to receive American
pork but Germany, Austria and othei
countries still unreasonably refuse. C«>n
gress is advised to treat with Great Britain
for a permanent settlement of the North
American fisheries question, the V» ashing
ton treaty having expired and being only
maintained through this fishing season by
diplomatic courtesy on tiie part of England.
It is hoped that an enlargement of extra
dition privileges with Great Britain wiL
soon be arrived at so that so many Ameri
can criminals cannot find shelter iu Cana
da. It is hoped that the international
boundary iu Alaska be mortf clearly defin
ed as soon as possible. Two long-standing
claims against Hayti have lately been set
tled and the Haytian government is dis
posed to provide for other claims of oui
citizens. Mr. YanBokken, an American
citizen in Hayti, was imprisoned there and
denied the relief afforded ordinary resi
dents of that country ; he was released on
demand. It is recommended that the
commercial treaty with Mexico be ratified
so that it will become effective and open
that country more fully to American capi
tal and enterprise. An arbitration has
settled the award for a claim against Spain
growing out of the loss of the ship Ma
sonic in the Phillipinc Islands and other
questions with that country are being ne
gotiated. Negotiations are also afoot with
Spain for a commercial treaty relating to
Cuba. Turkey gives notice of the termin
ation of her commercial treaty with this
country. The attention of congress is
called to the undefined and inadequate
condition of our naturalization and citi
zenship laws and legislation outlie subject
is recommended. The treaties between
tli is country and San Domingo and with
Spain in relation to Cuba negotiated last
year, but not ratified, are discussed and
disapproved as not being sufficiently fa
vorable to the United States. It is urged
upon congress to recast the salaries of con
suls to enable them to live in comfort and
respectability and that no fees be allowed
them, all fees to be returned to the United
States; also that a system of consular in
spection with regular inspectors or special
consuls be instituted. Other reforms in
he consular Service are recommended. It
is recommended that the legation quarters
in several eastern countries be purchased j
and owned by the government or. when j
offered as a gift, as in several instances,
accepted and held permanently. It is
recommended that the discriminating tar
iff upon the works of foreign artists be
removed inasmuch as American artists are
much indebted to foreign masters for in
struction and models.
The total ordinary revenues for the year
ending June 30.1885, were #322.690,
disbursements f260.226,935: paid on pub
lic debt $45.993,235: surplus now on hand
available for ordinary purposes #66,818.
292. The president refers at some length
to tlie «piestion of reducing the revenue—
not fr« >ni a free trade point of view but
for the purpose of lessening the burdens
of taxation on the people who ultimately
pay the duties levied at tlie custom houses.
As the revenues are in excess of the ex
penditures-Jie believes that it is the duty
of tlie government to lessen the taxation
on the necessities of life, always remem
bering the interests of American labor and
American investments. During the year,
145 national banks have been organized
and the number now in existence is 2,727.
Referring to tlie silver question President
Cleveland says that about 215,000,000
silver dollars have now been coined by tlie
government and the coinage goes on by
compulsory law at the rate of #2,000.000
per mouth : 55.000.000 silver dollars are
in circulation and #93.000.000 in silver
certificates. Every month two million in
gold is being paid out for the same amount
in silver which latter is being added to the
idle mass while the government's gold i»
being depleted and at the same time the
proportion of silver paid for duties is in
creasing, being now about 20 per cent of
the whole. He thinks the hoarding of gold
has already begun and w ill continue until
it will be practically withdrawn from cir
culation. Then rich men will place enor
mous premiums upon gold and that will
amount to a depreciation of silver, (then
the only circulating medium), and rich
men will be richer and poor men poorer;
everything will rise in price and all the
evils ot a depreciated currency will come
upon the country. President Cleveland
expects this to result from the continued
coinage of silver. It is impossible to get
foreign powers to agree to a bi-metallic
conference and our credit will be impair
ed if we reach the silver standard ns we
inevitably must iu his opinion if the pres
ent silver law remains and is enforced.
The repeal of the compulsory silver coin
age act is, therefore, earnestly recom
mended.
A saving of #17,000 in the cost of steam
boat inspection service has been effected.
A reform in the conduct of the coast and
geodetic survey service lias been effected
and a law to definitely fix its scope and
purpose is recommended. The remarka
ule fact is adduced that during the yeai
more than half of our total army has been
tried by court martial. Many of the of
fenses were frivolous and it is suggested
that some more summary method of trial
than by court martial be devised and it it
Minted that the conduct of courts-martial
might be profitably reformed. A shorter
term for first enlistment in the army it
suggested as likely to reduce the number
of desertions which last year numbered
2,027. It is suggested that the law be
changed so that graduates of West Point,
or whom there are no immediate vacancies,
be retained on the army list and assigned
to duty when vacancies occur. The pres
ident lias selected no second lieutenants
from civil life in order that the West
Pointers may have a chance.
In referrirg to tlie navy department
some scathing references are made to the
scandals, abuses and wastefulness which
have marked its administration. The ne
cessity of a navy is urged in order to de
fend our extensive sea coasts and put us
in a position to conduct negotiations with
foreign powers from an attitude of digni
fied defense. Our navy could not stand
before one war shipof any important pow
er; it is a "naval reminder of the past"
and the navy department is "for ornament
• >nly." In the past seventeen years #75,
000,000 have been spent on a navy and to
show for it "we have only the discontent
and apprehension of a nation undefended
l>y war vessels." If we are to have a navy
there has got tobe a re-organizajion of the
methods that have obtained in the navy
department and an advance on the lines
suggested by the experience of other na
tions and no more corruption and waste.
It is recommended that some changes
be made in the judiciary system so that
çoarts will not be overburdened with bus
iness and that U. S. attorneys and mar
shals be paid bjr fixed salaries in order to
prevent them from encouraging litigation
to increase their fees. In tbe matter of
Indian affairs the appointment of a com
mission of six, half from the army, is
suggested, the commission to make all the
investigations, inspections and recommend
ations now arrived at by special or general
committees of congress on Indian ques
tions and by special agents. A modifica
tion of land laws and a conservative policy
m disposing of public lands are recom
mended and also that had grant railroads
be held to strict accountability. A firm
attitude is taken on the Mormon question
and a rigorous execution of the laws
against polygamy is urged. Some legis
lation in regard to the presidential succes
sion is recommended. The president re
iterates his well-known views of civil ser
vice relorm and concludes with the hope
that congress will do its work well, with
out being hampered by partisan or selfish
aims.
