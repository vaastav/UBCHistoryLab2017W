PULL LEASED WIRE REPORT
OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.
The State Journal la a member of the
Associated Press and receives the full day
telegraph report of that great news or
ganisation for the exclusive ateroooa
jrabllcation in Topeka.
Tha newa la received In The State Jour
nal building over wires for this sola pur
pose. Joplln, Mo., can afford to toss a
smile or two in the direction of her
sister, Kansas City. Joplln has a new
union depot in working; order.
That proclamation Issued by Mr.
Madero declaring; himself to be the
president of the new republic of Mexi
co does not appear to have been very
effective. '
Oklahomans are now talking of fix
ing: on a compromise site for the loca
tion of the state's capital. That's busi
ness. Why not place it half-way be
tween Guthrie and Oklahoma City as
the crow flies?' "
Some of the "big battleships which
have been planned cannot be built be

enough money for them. Stingy old
congress. It set aside only $ 6,000,000
for each of these ships.
At least one Roosevelt presidential
record has been beaten by President
Taft., His message to congress yester
day Is much longer than any of the
many which were penned by the col
onel. There will be no doubt now in the
minds of many that China is not pro
gressing and progressing rapidly to
wards a higher civilization. The Ce
lestial Kingdom has begun a reorgan
ization of its army and navy on mod
ern lines. -
If anybody hereabouts thinks that
Topeka has not grown and developed
wonderfully during the fifty-six years
of its life, he ought to take a trip
through the smaller cities in the New
England states which have been in
existence for more than a hundred
years.
Isn't it pretty near time for Walter
Wellman to announce that he will at
tempt some other impossible featT
Presumably, though, he will have to
be in Washington during the present
session of congress to see that the af
fairs of the United States are conduct
ed In a proper fashion.
Governors of the other forty-five
states of the union are apparently most
derelict in their duty to their con
stituencies. They have as yet failed
to advise the president of the United
States as to whom he should not ap
point to the vacancies on the bench
of the federal supreme court.
Colonel Roosevelt Is to make his first
public statement as to the causes
which led to the recent political up
heaval at a dinner to be given by the
New Haven Chamber of Commerce on
December 13. Mark the date. It's to
be wondered for whom this statement
Will be unlucky.
China may e only partially civilized in
the eyes of occidentals but it seetns
to have a pretty effective idea for wag
ing a successful crusade against the
use of opium by its pig-tailed inhabit
ants. It has decided not only to pro
hibit the importation and smoking of
opium, but also to prohibit the culti
vation of the weed from which this
drug Is made.
Things are coming to a pretty pass
before long. The opinion was express
ed recently that woman is becoming
more masculine all the time and that
man is becoming more effeminate. This
being true there will .be a period when,
in these Journeys, man and woman will
reach the same stage. Than the kiddles
will be compelled to guess and let it go
at that as to which is pa and which
is ma.
Attorney General Wlckersham has
given out a letter from Colonel Roose
velt in which an alleged offer of a big
campaign contribution ' by electrical
interests is termed an attempt at open
bribery. And electrical interests are
one of the corporation specialties of
"Blue-eyed Billy" Sheehan whom
Tammany proposes to ' send to the
United States senate to succeed Chaun
oey M. Depew. -
Congress will have to work overtime
if it has any disposition to enact any
considerable portion of the president's
recommendations into law. Nor is
there a single one of them which is not
worth while. But the chances are that
congress will chiefly concern - itself
during the short session with passing
appropriation bills. No reluctance is
ever shown by congressmen in taking
up for consideration any - legislation
that provides for an expenditure of
'public funds. , . . - . ;
ESTIMATES NEEDED CTTTTTVG.
James A. -Nation, the .state auditor,
appears to have used - much excellent
discernment in his handling of the
estimates of the moneys - which the
heads of the three large state educa-
i tional institutions think they will need
during- the next couple of years for the
conduct of these institutions. He has
slashed these estimates right and left
and pared them down to the bone.
But he does not seem to have so re
duced the material items in them in
any way that will interfere with the
management of these Institutions along
desirable and progressive lines. ' His
knifing has been more concerned with
a weeding-out of , ' the "extras" that
each of these institutions would like to
have,' but which they can get along
very well without for the present.
Kansans have been exceedingly lib
eral with their appropriations for the
State university, the State Agricultural
college and the State Normal college
during the past few years. They have
been glad to develop, these institutions
to a high plane, where they will rank
favorably with similar institutions in
other states. They are proud of the
success in this particular which has
been achieved by the men to whom the
management of these Institutions has
been entrusted. And they would pro
test loudly against any effort on the
part of state officials or the legislature
to make money allowances to these In
stitutions which would cripple them in
any way.
But they are not disposed to have
these institutions extravagantly con
ducted or developed. There is no need
why unusually large sums of money
should be expended all in a lump within
three or four years to provide these
institutions with every possible educa
tional adjunct that some of the older
educational institutions of the country
have been a generation or two in ac
quiring. It would appear that the less
haste' the most speed rule would be a
good one to apply in this particular.
These institutions should be developed
and enlarged but the development and
enlargement should be gradual.
And Kansans may well be pardoned
for arriving at the conclusion that the.
ever increasing demands from the
heads of these Institutions, for money
with which to do ' this and that, are
stimulated by a rivalry between these
same institutions to get ahead of each
other. Such a rivalry should not exist.
Unfortunately, it does. The only way
to wipe it out will be by putting the
supervisory administration of all of the
educational institutions supported by
the state in the hands of one educa
tional board.
CHRISTMAS GIFTS FOR COUNTRY.
There are some gifts this country
needs, and that woman pan put in its
Christmas stocking, says Harper's Ba
zar for December. If she does not,
America will go without them, day by
day, throughout year after year, and
suffer for the lack. One is the gift of
pure food, in every home pure food
which never will be reached until the
women of the United States insist upon
its manufacture, its presence on the
grocery shelves, its , safe-guarding by
adequate law.
Another gift needed is that of the
right of every American child to live,
to be educated until its fourteenth year,
to be protected against the forces of
greed and of evil. Christianity means
this or it means nothing; and yet ba
bies all over the land die by the thou
sand, poisoned by stale milk or mur
dered by tenement conditions; and lit
tle children toll, dwarfed and exploit
ed, in American mills and mines and
sweatshops. Not until every woman
helps to give every child its life and
its rights in our land has she come
into the true national spirit of Christ
mas. A third is the gift of health. It rests
with the women to create the home, the
school, the municipal conditions of
wholesome living in each community.
Pure air in every room, cleai surround
ings, sanitary laws these are no mys
tery beyond any woman's learning, or
beyond the power of woman's concert
ed action to gain Inside and outside
their homes. All men agree, all doctors
repeat, that woman alone can confer
this gift of public health in all its de
tails and its fullness. -
There are others. But Just these three
If 1910 saw them given, what a ChriBt
mas Uncle Sam would have, and how
he would rise up and call the givers
blessed!
MONEY FROM SOME WEEDS.
Any weeds on your place? asks the
Kansas Industrialist and it continues:
One year's seeding, the old farm prov-.
erb says, is seven years' weeding. Bet
ter get busy and do something. The
big stick in the weed industry is to
prevent the seeding no royal road, noJ
easy task, but mighty Important to
every farmer. You Just have to ge
down and work hard if once you get
a fine stand of weeds. Watch all your
seed, know it is clean; send it to the
Kanras State Agricultural college, .de
partment of botany, if necessary, and
have it analyzed.
Of course if you're going into the
weed business it's different. Some of the
most noxious weeds that thrive today
are the sources of crude drugs now
obtained wholly or in part from
abroad. The plants from which medi
cines are made, burdock, dandelion,
couch-grass, pokeweed, tansy, catnip,
jimson-weed, etc., can be collected and
sold as crude drugs. The nrices paid
are not high. Yet, if in getting rid of
weeds and thus increasing the value
of the land the farmer can make the
weed a source of a small income in
stead of a loss, it isn't a poor idea
after all. - -
Korea's Real Name.
Most of the newspapers and ' many
of their readers have, denounced the
Japanese not only for annexing Korea,
but for changing its very name. It is
only fair to the Japanese, who have
tried to deal very gently with Korean
susceptibilities, to point out that they
have done nothing ot the sort. In the
treaty of annexation Korea is called
Cho-sen, which has been the name of
the country for the last 500 years and
more. Surely every writer and news
paper reporter who has traveled in the
east has referred to Korea, with a
graceful, literary touch, as the Land
of the Morning Calm, which is a po
eticaj translation - of Cho-sen. ; How
comes It, then, that no one in the edi
torial rooms recognized the title in the
treaty? The name Korea is one of
those most strange bastard titlea that
Europeans have given to eastern coun
tries whose language they could not
read or speak. The ordinary Chinese
name for the people of Cho-sen Is
Kao-li, which in vulgar parlance be
comes Ko-ri (1 and r being interchange
able in all the far eastern languages).
Travelers from the west found the
word Ko-ri in common use and dubbed
the country Korea. Metropolitan Mag

KANSAS COMMENT
PENSION MOTHERS? WHY NOT?
Dr. Anna L von Sholly, of New York
city, a member of the babies' hospital
staff, sai-s: ,
"The state should support mothers
for two years after the birth of each
child."
Of course, Dr. Sholly is advocating
more paternalism, at which the dear
conservatives shudder but that's about
all they can find to do: shudder.
Why not pension mothers especially
the wives of poor men who become
mothers; and there are decidedly more
poor mothers than rich mothers?
Dad, the common worker, Is the busi
est man on this earth about the time
he finds out there is going to be anoth
er mouth to feed. He saves and saves
to pay the doctor and the trained nurse,
and to take care of mother while she is
sick.
And it Is a certainty that he can't
save enough so that there is much left
after the new one appears on the Bcene.
If mother and baby are not at least
fairly well taken care of. one or both
of them will die and good citizens are
lost. -
So why not pension the wife of a poor
man each time that she becomes a
mother?
Why not make it possible to give the
youngster a proper start in life, as well
as to preserve mother's health, for she
is tha real bone and sinew of the land.
'Tis not Mrs. Clarence Van Dusen,
blueblood. who makes the country
great; but .it is Mrs. John Smith, who
produces the babies who grow into
brawny-armed men and stout girls, and
who must be (produced if the work of
the future is to be done.
And there will always be work, for
this is a workaday world. Wichita Bea

BETTER BUTTER NOWADAYS.
Farmers have received fully two and
a half cents a pound more for their
butter fat this year, in proportion to
the selling price of the butter, than
ever in the history of the state. This
has been largely "due to the informa
tion disseminated by the 'office of the
dairy commissioner at the Kansas State
Agricultural college. The cream buy
ers and cream station operators through
instruction, now conduct their tests for
butter fat more accurately. Fewer com
plaints are heard from farmers. More
than 1,800 cream buyers have been in
structed and examinations given as to
their proficiency in making cream tests
and in their knowledge of the ordinary
sanitary regulations required of dairy
men. Where competent, these men have
granted permits to buy cream.
The number of creameries in the
state is increasing. The quality of the
butter is better, and its reputation
abroad has improved. Through the ef
forts of the dairy commissioner's office,
the sanitary conditions of the cream
stations have been greatly improved.
Atchison Champion.
FROM 07 HER PENS
THE HUMAN ELEMENT.
The subject of American agriculture
is receiving general attention. There
are obvious reasons for this. The ratio
between supply and "demand is chang
ing unfavorably for the consumer. The
balance between the producer and the
nonproducer through migration from
the country to ,the city, and particu
larly through .'jriimigration from
Europe, has been"abnormally altered.
The railroad president; the college pro
fessor, the politician, the law-maker,
the plain consumer and the agricul
turist himself, each from his point of
view, have contributed to the sym
posium on this momentous subject. A
state commission is now seeking sug
gestions as to what may be done to turn
men back to the soil. We are realizing
the fact that in the last analysis the
very existence of a nation depends
upon its supply of physical nourish
ment. In the course of the discussion many
ways of stimulating the landward
movement and of Increasing our food
supply have been suggested. All who
have offered "hints," whether or not
they stopped to analyze its nature,
have found themselves confronted with
an impalpable, but, nevertheless, a real
wall. It is that self-evident fact that a
man is not an ox. He cannot be driven
as one drives the beast in the field. He
is a creature possessed of volition. The
pursuit of happiness is his right. Lib
erty of opportunity is bound up with
our institutions. It is existent, for in
stance, in the foundations of whatever
immigration policy we have. New
York Tribune.
o
IMPERIAL SPLENDOR.
Visions of empire have seized the
new British king, Who, not content
with being crowned only at Westmin
ster like his predecessors since Henry
VI retired discomfitted in the fifteenth
century from France, where the Eng
lish kings had claimed sovereignty,
proposes to be crowned emperor of In
dia at Delhi, that ancient capital of the
India princes. King George will be
crowned at Delhi in 1912, and there
Queen Mary, the ambitious one, will
be hailed empress of India, with im
perial circumstance and pomp.
So far, then, from witnessing the as
cendancy of democracy in Great
Britain, we observe the growth of im
perialism. No longer is King George
to be content with empty titles of em
pire, attainable by mere kings, but he
will be crowned king of kings, like th
shahs and caliphs, khans and mahara
Jahs, and all the spendld potentates of
the Orient. William. Victoria, Edward,
these never thought to Journey by the
high seas to their far-flung dominions.
An innovation then, we are promised,
and one that may appease the hunger
of the crawling millions of India by the
very splendor of the coronation. De

THE EVENING STORY
A Fresh Start.
(By Louise Olney.)
It was Christmas week, but Sam
Morris hated the thought of the holi
day. Bending his head grimly to the
chill wind, he walked homeward. He
knew he was already late, that Rose
would be anxious and the supper
waiting, but he would not take the
car. Five rides instead of six for a
quarter as until the change that
morning made a difference both in his
purse and in his temper. He was an
gry and discouraged. He swung his
dinner pail defiantly as car after car
passed him. The car company would
n't get any nickel out of him that
night not if he knew it!
Dark came early, and the street
lamps were aflare in the little suburb
where he lived in a small cottage with
his wife and four babies, the eldest not
eight. Tramping up the walk, the cost
of living renewed its grip on him the
struggle seemed against him. Now
there was Jones he was passing
Jones's trim little house he had some
sort of luck. House paid for, a Job
as foreman with better pay and little
work. The Joneses had dinner instead
of supper, and the eldest daughter,
Elvie, had quit working down town.
Rose told him that young Peters, son
of Peters the big contractor, was "go
ing with" the girL And Jones had not
worked any harder than he, Morris
and was of doubtful promptness in bill
paying.
. As he came up to his own back
door, it opened, and Rose, with the
children at her skirts met him. He
was silent and rather gruff. He brush
ed them aside, took off his cap and
coat and vest, and began splashing
at the sink.
"I'm starved," he ventured from the
roller towel at length.
"Everything's on the table," an
swered his wife quietly.
She knew the man's moods and re
spected them. The day had not been
easy for her. The children had been
talking turkey constantly, and three
of .them needed shoes. Also the long
suffering doctor had sent in his bill.
She didn't know how to speak . ol these
things. The little family sat down
and ate the plain, well-cooked food;
the children were sleepy enough to be
quiet.
"You're more'n an hour late, Sam.
Working overtime?"
"No such luck. Even an hour's ex
tra work would count, I walked
home. See the papers? Car fare, like
everything else, has gone up a notch.
Only five rides for a quarter. I can't
afford luxuries." He broke a baked
potato for Johnny, dabbled it with
gravy and resumed his eating. Rose
wondered what more they could pos
sibly do without! It was her business
to make ends meet thus far she had
done it. But the string wouldn't bear
further stretching. . .
Sam spoke like an answer they
often thought in unison.
"We quit on butter and real milk
we have mighty little meat We never
go to a show. We barely keep the kid
lets in school and Sunday school. You
may have to give up your furs and dia
monds. Rose." . He laughed a little,
but the woman did not it was not her
way. She was waiting for some word
of practical comfort- And she did not
say that Mrs. Jones, brisk and over
dressed for her station, had descended
upon her .for a call that afternoon.
Elvie had a new pink dancing dress
and young Peters was going to take
her to a dance the next night
After the children had duly chatter
ed, and had been washed and put to
bed, husband and wife returned to the
kitchen, which was also dining and liv-ine-
room. She cleared up the table,
and while she washed the dishes Sam
poured over his account book, his brow
in a scowl, his pipe unlighted. He was
going to give up tobacco. He was glad
Rose did not know he took his dinner
bucket away and ate by himself, sensi
tive about the plainness of his fare.
The other men must think him a
grouch still, others ate alone; they
might not . have noticed. Jim Farney,
for instance he was- glad he was not
Jim, who had five children, one a crip
ple, and a half-sick wife whose house
keeping, even when she was well, was
a scandal. Well, ends had to meet
someway.
Then Rose got ' her mending, and
looking up, he met her patient glance.
She gave him a little tired smile it
was Monday and she had washed
without help. Then he went on figur
ing and she wondered Just what they
would have for dinner on Christmas.
The children must not be disappointed,
but turkey, or even chicken was out of
the question. Could she manage mince
p4e and oranges and some real milk?
Then she slipped off to answer the call
of the baby, covered the other children
more wafmly, and went to bed herself..
Tuesday dawned bleak, and' passed
into night, still ; bleak, and cheerless.
Sam was again late for again - he
walked home. The little ones, warned
by their, mother, were silent on the
turkey subject, and were put early to
bed. . - !
-But on. the day before Christmas,
husband and wife had a little talk,
planning carefully for the little feast.
Both knew that the grocer's bill must
be met; that the week after came a
payment on the house. They could not
afford debts, and therefore no extras.
Besides, there was the matter of the
shoes and the winter underclothing
Rose mentioned these so anxiously
that her husband broke out in a sort
of anger.
"Well, girl, don't be afraid of me. I
know we have to have things! We'll
manage somehow don't worry!"
But he worried, .and knew that she
did. They -rose, and be lit the fires
and helped the children dress.. A sort
of gloom hung over the breakfast
table, and suddenly Johnny exploded in
tears. The little srirls joined In sym
pathy. The child's grief, wormed out
fc 'mcfinally, was vested In tha Tact
that the Jones boys were going- to have
turkey an' everything else, an' go to
thow at the theayter besides. Couldn't
snw at the theayter besides, f Couldn't
The mother comforted, the father was
a little stern.
, "w.?'u have iust wht we can af
ford, he said, "and not a thing more.
You young ones ain't hungry nor cold
nor ragged like children on the street
every day. You keep still and eat
what's put before you. Your mother
always haa something good, and if it
ain't turkey, it will at least fill you
up. Now you finish your breakfast,
Johnny, and bring in some more coal
and get ready for school. We don't
pattern after the Joneses, and you got
to learn that and several other things.
One of them things is to be glad for
what you got now, and then to go on
with whatever your little business Is."
The father rose and took his dinner
pail. Rose had filled.it unusually well
with better food than usual. Her man,
the breadwinner, should be the last to
feel any lack. He went to his day's
carpentering.
When the three older children were
in school, Rose cooked for dear life.
She got plenty of good tender beef and
boiled it for a pie. which should be
overflowing-, with gravy, and replete
with little carrots and onions, parsley
and "flxin's." She made a huge sheet
of ginger bread. She baked pumpkin
pie. She molded the cranberry sauce
in little forms. She made a great plate
ful of molasses candy in fancy shapes,
for she was clever through her love.
There would be mashed potato, and an
orange a piece and some nuts, too. Her
day was full, for the baby was wake
ful. Supper wa plentiful, though plain,
but after waiting long and vainly,
mother and children sat down and ate
alone. Finally the little ones went to
bed. At 8 he. had not come, nor at S.
At 10 she was stiff with fear. What
had happened? An accident she would
have heard of that. She conjured up
fears, still mending mechanically. Could
he have begun to drink again? There
had, been some bad months in their
first married year. But for eight years
now he had been all a husband could
be then the familiar step came.
Sam came in, quietly, not to wake
the babies. " He was panting for
breath, black with coal dust, his eyes
bloodshot. He sank into a chair. Then
he smiled jt his wife, and unclinching
his right hand put two silver dollars
"For tomorrow," he explained. "It
may get chicken enough or a small
turkey. I've unloaded coal since 5.
The haulers have struck. I was glad
of the chance. See here. Rose, while
you get me a bite let me tell you the
news. We ain't so bad off. I saw Jim
Forney's pail, and he had only bread
and a little cooked meat. I divided
with him and I gave him two 3ol
lars. He's up against it. You don't
mind?" (
She shook her head and stirred the
fire.
"And there's trouble at Joneses.
He's mortgaged his place, and he got
fired today some tricky business
about the material. On top of that,
young Peters Is going to marry some
rich girl tomorrow. Elvie's all broke
up."
He went to the sink and washed,
and, sitting down,, attacked the baked
beans and bread and coffee. She
watched him, glad of his returned
cheerfulness.
"Other folks troubles makes a fel
low glad for what he's got. I'm
ashamed 6f the grouch I've had on.
You have the worst end of this part
nership, anyhow. Girl, we will cheer
up and take a fresh start." .
JJe rose..and .lit. his. pipe.. Then he
came to her chair and put his big
arm over her shoulder. '
"I hope . I ain't glad of Joneses
trouble," he said awkwardly. "I know
I'm sorry for him. But they gave
me his job. That means $15 more ev
ery month. You glad?"
She hugged her head down' against
his arm and nodded. She could not
speak. After a while, she took the sil
ver dollars from the table.
"Sam, what you said to Johnny this
morning was all right. I've got a
good dinner planned and we'll have
Just that and nothing more. This
money will get the boy his new shoes.
He's got to learn to put up with what
we can afford. What do yo say?"
He puffed his pipe, turning his head
lest the smoke get In her face.

On the magnificent grounds surround
ing Lord Brassey's beautiful Surrey
seat cricket matches are frequently
held during the season. Of one of these
games his lordship once told a capital
story. Available talent being scarce, it
was necessary to secure one of Lord
Brassey's footmen as umpire. In due
course his lordship himself went in, and
a local bowler was put on. - The second
ball the cricketing peer stopped with
his leg, and the cry was raised. "How's
that?" It was the footman who had
to answer, and turning to his master
he exclaimed, in a half-apologetic tone.
"I'm afraid I must say 'Not at home,'
your lordship." "Not . at home." cried
Lord Brassey. "What do you mean?"
'Well,' then, If you will have it," the
footman .responded, "I mean you 'are
hout." Ideas.
To Honor the Pilgrim Fathers.;
A committee has been formed - in
England to ' erect a 'memorial on the
spot from which the Pilgrim fathers
embarked on the Mayflower, when they
sailed for America in 1620. Prof. Hearn
shaw, of University college, Southamp
ton, haa received many communications
from descendants of the Pilgrim fath
ers, and the interest has apparently
been more extensive than the organiz
ers of the movement had hoped. r The
Wlnslow family wish to erect a panel
in memory of their ancestor. Among
the Americans who have been consult
ed are Andrew Carnegie, Seth Low, and
Governor Draper. Next year, if plans
are carried out, August 15 will be ob
served as Pilgrim Fathers' day on both
side of the Atlantic. Prof. Hearnshaw
is making a register of the descendants.
