ABOUT THE only recommendation of any
public interest In the annual report of the
secretary of war is forthe revival of the
grade of LieutenantGeneral The secre
tary says that in order that the administra
I tion of military affairs shall be attended
with dignity and authority the command
ing general should be conspicuously su
perior in rank to all subordinates This
Idea no doubt prevails in the war office but
it smacks too much of the effete monarchy
for this braozy country
IT is stated that MICHAEL DAVITT will re
sign his present seat in the British parlia
ment and run again without priestly as
sistance the charge of undue clerical lola
once having been made in regard to his
election One member has already been
seated on account of a bishops unwise pas
toral letter The London Cltronlcla says
such events may be useful to the Irish
party if It teaches thorn to curb their
I priests and to imitate OCoxNELL In repu
diating politics from Rome

I orouer has a sensible article on the subject
of the relations of the sheepHerder to the
wool tariff showing a tendency towards a
better understanding with the manufactur
ing industry We quote
Flockmastera need not fear that the inevit
able reduction of the tariff which tvlll follow
the Democratic victory is going to affect them
otherwise than favorably It will result In
enlarging the market for goods of American
manufacture and a consequently increased
demand for wool The only ones who can pos
sibly be affected unfavorably are the raisers of
carpet wools and a carpetwool sheep should
not be allowed to waste the grass on the ranges
The Presidents Message
The President says all the countrys
prosperity is due to the protective system
but after a rigmarole of high tariff talk
says the result of the late election must bo
accepted as meaning the repeal of the
same He undertakes to Indulge in soma
fine sarcasm on the subject of the oxpoctsd
disappointments of the people but until he
can rail the figures off the official returns
his taunts and jibes will pass only as the
bitter reflections of a defeated candidate
Mr HARRISON follows pretty much the
same line as in his latter accepting the
Minneapolis nomination whon commending
ing the work of his administration Es
pecially does he plume himself on the re
ciprocity experiments which have so com
pletely gone out of the public mind
la regard to the silver question Mr
HARRISON expresses his own confidence
in the final adoption of an International
white metal standard by the now reluc
tant governments but thinks it too early
to predict what may be accomplished at
Brussels This after the financiers of the
world have concluded that nothing of great
Importance will ba done
A review of tho operations of the several
departments of the government follows in
which the President eulogizes all the offici
als including RACM The President re
pents his recommendation of a nonparti
san commlttoa to investigate the evils of
congressional gerrymanders hints towards
a Force bill by referring to the lynching of
colored people in the south and concludes
with a few strains of Yankee Doodle na re
duced to plain unmusical prose composi
tion
Our report says the reading of the mes
sage met with little attention
A Most Important Duly
Today the election for members of the
Board of Education will take place in all
the precincts of this city The polling
places are aimed in another column of
Tun HERALD Every registered voter
should go to the polls and deposit a ballot
in the interests of education This is a
most important duty and ought not to be
neglected
It was hoped that no partisan feeling
would De permitted to have influence In
this election We believe this was the sin
cere desire of the majority of the citizens
But a few irreconcilable Liberals seemed
to bo determined to spoil this effort at
union They hare BO far succeeded teat a
conlest to iome extent partisan will take
place in the First precinct In all the other
precincts while there may bo s few votes
cast different from tho regular ticket most
likely the triple alllnce will prevail and
the regular nominees will be elected re
gardless of whether they are Democrats
Republicans or Liberals
Three out of the five candidates are now
membart of the board They havo served
the people faithfully and harmoniously
They have kept the cause of education Drat
in view They hUB studisd economy
while being liberal in necessary things
and have to a surprising extent avoided
party prefar nces and factional feelings
They will no doubt be reelected without
difficulty
Jp the Third precinct a wellknown in
telligent and active gentleman has been
selected by representatives of all tho
parties Ho can be voted for freoly aad
conscientiously by every citizen who can
cast aballot Tho retiring member MR
NEWMAN has sorted the people well and
deserves all the encomiums that are passed
upon him
In the First precinct the incumbent de
clines reelection He has othar duties
sufficiently onerous and cannot devote as
much time as Is necessary to this office
Thu dispute caused by tho rampant Lib
erals who wore determined not to fuse
with tho other parties unless ono of their
own faction was chosen for the candidate
has been pretty well ventilated They
think they can force their man upon the
board wituout the aid of anybody but their
own party nail have placed him la nomi
nation
The Republicans snd Democrats finding
it impossible to do anything with 10 im
practicable a clique as represented the
Liberal faction have wisely united on a
candidate for whom thoy ask the suffrages
of all citizens who desiro to exclude politics
from school affairs Mr J J THOMAS is
the gentleman selected as the nonpartisan
nominee All voters In the First precinct
whether Democrats
Republicans or
Liberals who wish to join in the non
partisan movement should vote for Mr
THOMAS This will give notice to the few
blatant Liberals who desire to run every
thing their ownway that they are not the
1t epers of the peoples conscience nor the
controllers of the peoples votes Let us have

Suits against railroads are common
things The sympathies of juries are
usually against tho big corporatibbs and
this encourages litigants and lawyer to
press claims that would not be thought
against private individuals
A somewhat novel suit has been en
tered on the consequential damages
order against the New York Central
I Hudson River railroad by a Ponghkeepsie
lady named Miss EVA FKEAR She claims
that she was engaged to a gentleman
named JOHN U BAGS ALL also of Pough
keepsie and that they wore traveling to
gether on that road at Christmas time In
I
1891 when a collision occuried Miss FRCAt
was injured Mr BAGXALL was killed
Miss FiiAii wants flOOOU
This demand is not on account of the
ladys bodily injury which appears to
have been but slight but she has lost a
husband and husbands are worth a
good deal to ladies who have not
many offers ot marriage Sho ex
pected to bo supported through life ana
as the railway collision has deprived her of
theso expectations she wants to be reim
bursed However it is understood that
she is willing to call the matter square for
half price that is 20000
Thero aro several probilitios that suggest
themselves in this case and it is likely that
these have induced tbe lady to offer to take
a reduction of the original amount do
mantled Among them is the possibility
that the gentleman would not havo married
her after all if he had lived Another is
that ho might not havo supported her it he
had married her as the divorce courts di
vulgo the face that some wives have to
support their husbands And further he
might tire of her as other wen have tired
of their spouses after a short honeymoon
and severed tho nuptial cord by judicial
assistance
There is no telling what a jury will do
when a railroad company is defendant in a
suit but we would not like to risk much on
Miss F cAns chances of success in this
novel case lor damages Considerable
curiosity will bo felt as to the decision
Tbo Snioso 3uUuuce
The smoke nuisance in this city is caus
ing a great deal of complaint This will
culminate in a movement to compel its
abatement by municipal authority unions
tho firms and corporations that create the
nuisance take stops of thoir own acoord to
removo it Tho volume of smoko from tho
chimneys of private residences is scattered
and inconsiderable But that from busi
ness blocks factories electric and other
works where large furnaces are In opera
tion is becoming very unplnasant and will
spoil the appearance of our most buautiful
buildings the evil is not soon suppressed
The nuisance can bo removed without
actual coat to the busiusas firm thtt create
it by the application of a simple coatriv
ones which while it causes the con
aumptlou of the smoke makes a
great saving in tho fuel used
This is not the plan by which I
a jet of steam is forced under the boiler
whore steam power is used It is a pat
ented method invented in London by an old
gentleman named FaRaDAY now residing
in this territory It has been tried in the
McCoRHiCK block and in the Wasatch
block and found to work well saving 20
per cent of the fuel
In one or two places objection has been
made that this process sbittructs the draught
somewhat But we are informed that this
is when the firing is not managed accord
ing to instructions Some fireman arc too
opinionated to change their methods
Where the fuel ia used as directed no ob
struction occurs and the saving wo have
named and more too can be effected So
we are credibly informed
The cost of this patent remedy including
tile work of putting it in is but ono hun
dred dollars an amount which will soon be
returned in the saving of coal it effects
We suggest that inquiries be made by those
who are contributing largely to the volume
of smoKo which is a detriment to our city
and that further complaint be rendered un
necessary through their voluntary action
if they find the omoko cure wo hove men
tloced to be effectual Tho patentee has
been offered inducements to take it to Chi
cago but prefers remaining in this terri
tory where he has made his home
Information Needed
The ignorance of most of tile people east
of Chicago in relation to tho silver ques
tion is constantly displayed The cam
paign of education urged by Tnr HCIULIJ
for the enlightenment of the people and
papers of the east was sneered at by our
morning contemporary but its own col
uinnn furnish evidence of the need of this
work It quotes from the Albany Journal
contradictory remarks which prove that
the editor of the Journal entirely misun
derstands tha subject
That paper repeats the notion to
which Tnn HEUALH has previously al
luded that free silver coinage would do an
injustice to the wageworkers the con
sumers tho creditors the pensioners the
savingsbanks depositors the holders of
life insurance policies and others be
cause of the inflation it would produce
How this imaginary inflation is to injure
these classes is not explained and Tnn
HmtALD would like coma gold mouometal
list to make it olosr if possible
We do not know of any class in the
United States that would be injured by
the inflation of silver currency except
the gold speculators Thora has never
been a time in the history of the country
BO far as wo are aware when there was
too much silver money in circulation to
suit the common people That there is too
little money in use now to carry on the
business of the world is recognized by
everybody monomeUUIata as well so bl
metallistii who have given the matter fair
consideration
But tho trouble is the subject is not
understood and the gold speculators
spread the same kind of alarm to which
the Albany Journal gives voice and thus a
widespread prejudice against silver as
money proralls and the success of the
white metal cannot be assured until tho
iguoranctf existing la dispelled by the light
of truthful information
It does not look likely that the Brussels
conference will do much toward tho res
toration of silver to its proper place The
prooability is that the utmost that will be
done will bo an increase in the govern
mental purchase of silver and a highering
of its legal tsnder limit The education
needed will have to be extended across the
Atlantic and into every European nation
before the fiumph of silver can come
But there is a powerful influence at work
in this country In its favor and if the inter
est which has been nwakened by the recent
election is promoted with persistence and
zeal the goal in view of the silver men
may be reached before many years havo
passed away

A Terrible Rill
Arctic explorations seem to have a fasci
nation for certain adventurous spirits and
tile repeated failures of polar expeditions
seem only to spur them on to deeds of dar
ing Lieutenant PBAUTS leave of absence
for three years granted by the secretary
of the navy is understood to be simply to
give the explorer a chance to make anothe
journey to the Arctic seas If he goes as
given out to the public simply to gather
geographical information in regions com
paratively unknown but yet within reason
able prospect of return there can be little
or no objection to tho undertaking But
some of the expeditions that have been en
couraged by the government can only be
characterized as foolhardy and chimerical
PBART appears ready to repeat them
Dr NANSEX whp made himself famous
by his journey across Greenland several
years ago has a much more perilous ven
ture in view than anything of tbo kind that
has beretofore been undertaken He pro
poses to travel in the ordinary way beyond
the northern coast of Siberia next spring
and then trust himself to the floating ice in
the fall expecting that it will bear him
northward towards the pole and then after
crossing the pOlarsea he will come out into
open water on the eastern coast of Green
land
A numer of currants more or less volum
inous are known to flow southward from
the polar basin and one immense body of
water computed at one hundred cubic miles i
a day combs down between Greenland and
Spitzbergen A portion of this is supplied I
by tile Norwegian Gulf stream that en
ters the polar basin north of Nova
Zambia another portion by the
northward stream from the Pacific
ocean through Bearing strait and other
contributions are Irom rivers that flow
into the polar sea The latter are of high
temperature and help to keep the sea north
of Siberia free from ice during part of the
year
yeatVarioua
Various articles and substances from the
Siberian coast have been found on the
coasts of Greenland and Spitzborgen and
Dr NANSBN is sure that a current is con
stantly running across the polar region
from the sea north of Siberia and Behring
strait and into tho ecu between Spilzbergen
and Greenland He has no doubt that the
ice floe travels in a regular route in that
direction and he proposes to take passage
upon it
A steamer of unusual strength named
the Fram is to be used for the voyage She
Is of only 600 tpns displacement 101 feet
keel 33 feet beam and 12 feat draft She is
to carry twelve men with food and fuel for
six years Two strong boats each large
enough for the entire crew will ba carried
The adventurers will go out with her to
the extreme northern open water limit
northwest Siberia and then locked in the
ice It will bo three years bolero they will
be able to report even if the current sup
posed to exist carrloa them to tile expected
outlet
1C this expedition succeeds the long de
sired information about tho north pole will
bs forthcoming the great problem in navi
gation i and in geography will be solved If
not ono more batch of venturous sailors
will have gone to join the hardy or fool
hardy seamen who have been sacrificed to
to tho greed forknowledge aud tho thirst
for notoriety The ritr is appalling tho
glory of success will be worldwide and
tsvorluBtlins But the very mention of the
dangers and hardships of such a venture
are enough to give the shivers to any or
dinary icador of tho proposition i
IF MR HOLMAN of Indiana is the Con
gressional watchdog of the treasury Mr
DOCKEHT of Missouri Is the loaferkiller
of all the departments He intends to start
very early this session a thorough examina
tion of tho details of the administration
with the viowJ of purging the various
bureaus and divisions of the dead beats and
bummers WhO hae BO long I infested them
Senator COOKREIL soma time sinco made
a labored and faithful report upon the
abuses prevailing and this movement of
DOCKERTS is right in line with it The
bookkeeping system shown that an ordi
nary clerk id a private busiuess house
could do in an hour what it takes fivo offi
cial persons three days to do Perjurers
profligate illiterates aud loafers are in
every department and instead of 15000
persons in such service onethird the
number would perform the duties more
successfully DocKErr has had an educa
tion in surgery and his sharp knife will go
deep into all these abuses
