The President's Message.
We not to
our columns with Mr. Grant's
Message. It is stupid reading
and povcrystricken, as the New
York Sun truly says "the
weak effort of a weak man, and
. will be acceptable ouly to the
bond-holder, the national bank
er, and New England manu
facturer." And we might also
pay that tlieio is not only no
.intelligence of the country's
actual condition in it, but it is
tilled with lies stupid and
nu'an lies, to boot. It pretend-
that they are pnying ff the
debt, when everybody knows
that it will never be paid, or
never Avill besought tc be paid.
It pretend"', also, to increased
economy in public affairs, when
everybody knows thnt within
the past year somewhere from
one to five hundred millions of
. the national property lias been
squandered on railroad thieves
nnd robbers. But after all,
there is a redeeming feature in
Giant's ludicrous policy of the
annexation of Santo Domingo,

The only claim offered in
extenuation of the notorious
deficiencies of Grant's adminis
tration is that he has reduced
the public debt ever so many
millions of dollars, as is shown
by the fraudulent public debt
misstatements issued monthly
by Boutwell, Secretary of the
Treasury. Now these state
ments are totally delusive, pur
posely designed to deceive, and
receive no more credence in
well informed financial circles
than would the unsupported
assertions ot a hot house dem
ngogue. But even if these
statements were as true as they
are raise, what would be th
resulting benefit to the pcopl
at large of this alleged reduc
tion of the public debt V Simply

only claim presented to justify
Grant's candidature for a re

eventually prove one of the

W. H. Langley, of Gallipolis,
writes to the Giilhpoli's Dis
patch, as follows:
Geo. D. Hebard, Dear Sir:
The McArthur people ap
pear to be wakinor up to the
lmnnrtance and necessity of
more action m behalt ot our
railroad enterprise. Mr. Thom
as B. Davis, the worthy and
energetic solicitor of Subscrip
tions, writes under yesterday's
date, that their subscription list
is now going ahead, and trial
within a few (lavs, he has, aid
ed bv Daniel Will," Esq., ad
ded several thousand dollars to
ilieir list and will use his ut
most endeavors to keep' the
list growing daily until the
amount necessary to finish gra
ding the road from the point
at which it shall cross the Ma
rietta road to Logan shall be
subscribed. This looks and
sounds like work, lie says
that. he has some good and cn.
ergetio men til work assisting
him, and that he intends Keep
ing the ball rolling.
Here our list of subscribers is
steadily increasing, and scarce
ly a day passes without adding
something to our list. As far
as people has been called on in
the county they have generally
responded promptly by making
liberal subscriptions, many or
them promising to double the
amount as soon as they can see
their way clear, and some say
they will double the amount as
soon as they see a certain pros-
pec.t ot the roau ocing ouut.
Tn Riifh I would beg leave to
say if you wish to make the
success ot the road a certainty,
double your subscriptions at
the start which would encour
age others to strain a point or
two, and make their subscrip
tions larger, and by that means,
the required amount would be
sooner secured, aud consequent
ly we would be sooner ready to
commence work on the road.
It is very desirable that we
should be ready to commence
work early next Spring, if at
all practicable. For by that
time, much or the torce now
employed on the Chesapeake
and Ohio road, will be through
with that work, and I have no
doubt that more favorable ar
rangements can lie then made
for labor and grading material,
than at a later day. The road
can, and rau.-t be built. But
whether it can be done in one,
two, three, five or ten years,
depends altogether upon the
amount of subscriptions, aud
the promptness with which they
ire made. As stated above, the
citizens of the county are re
sponding freely, according to
their means, aud there is plen
ty of room on the city list for
many thousand dollars to be
added to their present (in most
cases) liberal subscriptions.
What do you say, citizens ot
Galhoolis i Will you add a
few hundred or a few thousand
dollars more to your present
subscriptions and thus hurry
the matter along? and, also,
by so doing, encourage the cit
izens of the county to increase
their list by additional names,
and by adding to their sub
scriptions already made ? As
I have repeatedly said before,
I have not a doubt but there is
plenty of surplus means in the
counties on the route between
here and Logan to grade the
road without subjecting any
one to serious inconvenience, if
every one will subscribe what
their means aud their interest
in the enterprise will justify
thcra in subscribing, and I have
t , i j . i 1
no doubt out tneir subscrip
tions will pay better dividends
than any stock now held in
Ohio, whether National, State,
or Railroad stock. I do not
think there are a dozen men in
the county, as far as they have
been called upon, who have re
used to subscribe. But there
are probably that number and
x?sibly a tew more who. have
taken more time to consider,
and I have not much doubt
ut these will subscribe in good
time, letters ot lNov. 2btn,

very much mistaken you will
fiud that just as soon as we can
get ready, and break dirt for
building our road that other
roads will seek connection with
the Chesapeake and Ohio, road
at this point over our road, and
as soon as it is known that the
building of our road is a fixed
fact, I have but little doubt
but the New Lisbon and Galli
polis road via Pomcroy win be
soon put through to this point,
aud very probably continued
on down the river to Catlcts
burg, Ky.
Think for a moment what
advantages our citizens would
be at this moment, deriving
from the coal trade alone, if
wo had our road in operation
to the coal beds of Raccoon.
Every bushel of coal that the
road could carry, it worked to
its utmost capacity night and
day, would find a profitable
market along mo river, ior
while there has been plenty of
water from this point down,
throughout the fall for moder
ate sized coal barges, there has
not been water enough above
to keep the markets below well
supplied with coal, aud, as a
consequence, at many points
the price has materially ad
vanced. From inquiries and
estimates I have made with
our road completed to the coal
beds of the Raccoon, we can
put coal on our barges cheaper
than it can he delivered in bar
ges opposite our Handing, from
any point above this, and of
quality equal to the best Pitts
burgh or ilonongahela coal, and
it can be delivered on the plat
of the town of G.dlipolis full
(2) two cents per bu-mel cheap
er than from any point on the
Kanawha or OIho river?.
These are facts that should not
bo overlooked by our citizens,
and are clearly demonstrated to
any person that will take the
trouble to iuhrm themselves ot
the facts. The quantity of coal
. T T 1 1 1
in the Kaccoon Valley is al
most inexhaustible for all time
to come. 'From inquiries made
of Mr. Chas. Green and Mr.
McCarley, of the Keystone
Furnace, while there in June
last, 1 learned that commencing
in the bed of Little Raccoon at
that point and going to the tops
ot the lulls, there were five (5;
different veins of coal amount
ing in the aggregate to about
20 feet of coal ; then from their
remarks there must be a vein
of cannel coal tbat underlies
these veins, and from what in.
formation I have since gained
from other sources, I think
there is one or two heavy veins
that underlie all these veins
named above; but without them
consider for one moment the
immense amount of coal supe
rior quality lying within 20
miles of us only requiring
cheap means of transportation
to deliver it in our town, and
by its movement of the inex
haustible quantities of iron ore
that lies with it. To induce
population and capital to come
among us, and thereby revive
and increase the business of
our town and the whole coun
ly, in every department, once
more I urge every person that
in tavor ot the enterprizc
to do all you can, and as
promptly as practicable, and
all doubts about succes3 will
soon vanish.

Wife Trading.
One of our citizens was down
iu Vinton county, recent lv, for
a short time, on business, where
he learned the particulars of a
little traue, as follows : Iwo
men, ono named T. and the
other 15., lived neighbors to
each other, and were on quite
friendly terms so friendly, in
deed, that the project of tra
ding wives was ngitated. -
T , (who had three children,
while B had none) wanted
a little "boot," and B- , af
ter some "chaffing," offered nn
iron wedge, as being about the
difference between the two wo
men. This was accepted, and
the trade consummated, the
wives apparently having no ob
jections in fact, as a proof of
affection, Tatmau's wife gave
15 s wife a new dress.
When the consummation of
the trade became known, the
people in the neighborhood
talked of doing a little mob-
binsT in the case, but B
sent word that if they annoyed
him he would blow some of
their heads off, stating that it
was a fair trade and all parties
were satisfied, and it was no
body else's business, etc., etc.
So B was let alone, and
still lives there. T man,
however, moved away. The
affair occurred about a month
ago. Chillicothe Register.

trading parties arc residents of

and sober editor of the Regis
ter is sadly needed in that wife

We present a fac simile of
the fowl which played such an
important part at the battle of
Lake Erie, in 1813, while Coin
mod re Perry's fleet was engag
ed with the British fleet. Just
in the midst of a desperate
struggle when each of the
commanding officers were do
ing their utmost to conquer,
and while the shot and shell
were pouring clown upon the
Commodore's vessels at a 'des
perate rate, a ball from one of
the enemy's guns struck a cocp, I
iu wincn was a iowi, or wiiicn
the above is a true represents
tion, tearing tho coop to pieces,
aud scattering it in every direc
tion. Meanwhile the fowl eseap
ed unharmed. At this iuno
turc, the tide of battle seemed
to be against the Commodore:
his men becran to desnair of
victory, when, all at once, this
lovvl sprang upon an elevated
position and crowed, loudly
three times three. A dead sil
ence pervaded tho whole fleet.
Uomniodore Terry stood for a
moment meditating, and then
turning to his men said: "Men.
do you hear that not conquer
ed yet I" In an instant, as if
by magic, every man at his
post ngain. The battle was
resumed; the contest was severe,
but in a very 6hort time the
enemy's guns were silenced.
and Commodore Perry and his
men were crowned with vic
tory. And tho men who com
posed that noble crew ever af
terwards paid duo reverence.
and, in fact, almost idolized

ate period in our country's
listory, thousands of our people
yet pay all duo respect to his
noble qualities.
