minority side of the Tlouse had been am 'ted
spectators, passive and watting, but at
Mr. DlnglejV leply to Mr. Walker, he was
asked by u member of the minority
whether measure to effectuate the recom
mendations of the President on the cui
rency would gc to the Ways and Means or
the Currency Committee. To this questi i-i
the Republican leader gave an evasi.'e
answer, merelj saying thnt if it rcU'ed
I to the redemption fund Mich a bill wujld
go to the Way and Means Committee.
"If," snld Mr. Johnson, cf Indiana, "it
was intended to retire the greenbacks in
the manner recommended by tl.c Presi
dent vliat disposition Would be made or
it?"
"I would leave the determination," said
Mr. Dingley, to the Speaker."
"It is to avoid this that I desire this
question to be made f I ear at the present
time," snlrl Mr. Johnson. "Does tl.e chair
man of the Was and Means Committee
think a bill embodying the principle or
the President's recommendation would ef
fect the redemption fund""
"1 think it docs." Mr. Dingley replied,
hesitatingly.
"Then the gentleman indirectly nnmrers
our question," commented Mr. Johnson.
When 11 became apparent that the reo
lutiou would,, npfc lie acted upon without
debate Mi. Dingley arranged witn tie
minority for thirty minutes for each side.
The btll vas bet rolling by Mr. WilkT,
who said, In language pertinent and
forcible, that if tlie question relatlj.r lo
our legal tender money, which lay at the
very foui dullon of our currency and bu.ik
lng laws, wctij to come under the juris lic
lion of the Ways and Means Conimil'ce,
the Con mil tee on Hanking and Currency
might as well go out of existence.
Congressman Cox of Tennessee, a p.; iy
cratlc member of the Committee on Bank
ing and Currency, backed up Mr. Walker
and ill dared that the recommendations of
the Presitlpiit as to national bank circula
tion vere Intcrwoeu with the proposal
to retire the greenbacks. In his opinion the
object of Mr. Dingley's resolution was io
so divide the mnttei at issue that notnJng
radical wculd be the result.
Congressman Wheeler of Al.ibama was
given five minutes, which he dovoted to
a discussion of .irmor plate for his State,
and then Gen. Grosvenor got the opening
lie has awaited ever olnce the eloe of
tlie extraordinary session. He Ignored l he
financial subject under debate, and, meta
phorically taking off his coat and vctt,
assailed the civil service reform. Ho de
clared, with customary emphasis, that to
oppose the civil servico reform would uc I
offend the President, for Congress A' as
empowered and had the right lo deal with
the subject, inasmuch as it had been ;e
f erred to Congress by the President. He
believed that there were some c.tses in
the classified service that should ne ex
empt, but these place-s were few, .is the
law now stands.
Mr Giosvenor denied that tlie civil serv
ice lias the sanction or the people as the
President stated. In confirmation of tnte
Mr- Giosvenor said that if tin question of
civil service leform were submitted to tl.e
people west of the Allegheny Mountains it
would be burled from sight.
The first applause of tho session wis
given Mr Grosvenor by his Hepublica:i
colleagues when he declared in an im
passioned voice:
"We shall never submit in this country
to the establishment of a system that pro
vides for life tenure In office."
There wa another demonstration "when
he said the system would build up a pril
Ioged class.
Congiessman nrosius is the chairman of
the cot. mittec on civil servics reform, and
he felt dpoply grieved at the expressions
of the Venerable member froln Ohio. He
defended the law, and said that if the
PresiCent found it unsatisfactory he ha I
the pjwer to correct any errors. Legisla
tion or the question. In his opinion, .vas
an Indignity to the President.
Mr. Fitzgerald, the young Democrat from
Massachusetts, read a report showing
that Democrats could not obtain appoint
ment to oificc under the civil evic
examinations, although Republicans who
failed to pass equally as good examinations
obtained offices at all times.
Congie-sman Johnson took Gen. Grosve
nor to task in severe languuge- He de
clared that civil sen Ice reform was a
cardinal principle of the Republican party
He anaigued Gen. Grosvenor for not recog
nizing this principle.
This, debate exhausted the time al
lowed, and Mr. Dingley contentinc to a
modiricalion of tlie roolutlon to suit the
Banking and Currency Committee, tlu
resolution passed without opposition, and
the lioiiselnnnedlately adjourned.

Plan.
REPUBLICAN PARTY DIVIDED
Tho Scnnto Will Not Tolerate the
Idea of Destroying the Green
back' Senntors and Ilepresesnta
tlves Discuss tlie Subject and In
dulge in Adverse Criticism.
The impossibility of th Republican ef
fecting auv legislation on tlw currency ques
tion at this session of Congress was. strik
ingly illustrated jesterday by the. family
row in the House over the disposition of
that part of the message relating to none
tary mattois. While this was being ''s
cussed on the one side, Senators were
quietly talking about the possibility of
doing anything In the Senate. Leadens
on the riiif.iice Committee have looked 'mo
the question, and one of the most promi
nent last evening said that It would be i.n
absolute v.aste of time to attempt to ilo
onyihlnr: thnt the "situation would be mule
even worse than it is and that tho sure
result or the agitation or the subject vould
ba a Tree colnuge bill.
The severe criticism ..r the President's
message has only Deen accentuated by
the annual report or Secretary Gage und
his recommendation1. The President mlg'it
have been a Utile ambiguous, but th -re
Is no ambiguity about what Scrr.it it
Gage beefes to accomplish. Both the mes
sage aud the re-port v.iU be ignorH. Vet
one Republican uu!d be fcamd yestaduy
who wouid expiebs tin belief that there
was the least possible chance for l jfs-
latlon.
If tin- leaders In the Senate have their
way they will avoid courting responsi
bility. Debate cannot, however, be stifled,
nnd thete will be muoh said about the
'nonej question, but the passage of the
bill by the House would eventually bring
the matter tsefore the Senate, where It
would rumain as a standing subject for
discussion for weeks.
Republicans wlio talk freely in private
are coMemning the President for forcing
this matter upon the Congress. One of
the most influential Senators on the Re
publican side said yesterday tliat the
President was urged not U take this nub
ject ui seriously for the reason that his
own party was not agreed upon it and tl.e
reeommendnirji.s woulel only bhov the
weakness of the party tj the opposition.
It is clear that the President, with the
lack of decision characteristic of tutu, 'ins
Miught to straddle the currency quest ioi.
He ha- attempted to conciliate the old
m"i- with the indirect suggestion of 'h
retlretti( nt of the greenbacks, and 1 as
throwa out a palpable bid for wlver
friendship by suggesting the poSbibPily
of something further I'rom the Wolcott 1.1.11
uiisslon. The silver men accept the su.il
lenge that has been given them and in his
message Mr. McKlnleyhas given the Demo
crats some of the best campaign litera'ure
they hre had since the money qutioa
becaui2 the great isueot the day. No part j
can go before the people advocating the re
tirement ol tlie greenback and the institu
tion or a non-intereK-boaring debt for
one that draws interest.
Several Senators are preparing to rip
this message open and show ItJ. Weakness
In debate. Never before has the absolute
statement been made by any President
that the greenbacks should be redeem; 1 n
gold. It Is not a matter of law, but of
Treasury regulation, and public men point
out the pclf-evideut fact that the whole
problem, so fai as the greenback Is con
cerned, would be solved, if the regu.a
tlons "wtte changed so as to reipiie
the Treasury and not the holders of the
note, to designate In what kind of money
they shall 1 c redeemed.
Senator Bacon, of Georgia, characterizes
the currency scheme as only a shift to
supply the deficiency in the quantity or
tho currency by fictitious and representa
tive mouf-y instead of real money.
Senator Vest Fays there are a good many
men in both bouses belonging to the Presi
dent's parry who will uot agree to the re
tirement of the greenbacks nor their con
version into gold notes. Nor does he be
lieve the plat, to reduce the taxation .ipon
national bank notes ami give the bank-,
power to issue circulation to the face val le
of the security bonds will be adopted.
Senator Joues thinks the Wolcott com
mission is referred to only to be let down
easily, lo suggebt that we may expect
anything from the work of that commis
sion is, lie says, utterly absurd.
The following arc borne additional com
ments on the currency plan:
Mr. Sayers.of Texas: 'The lecommen.la
tion that 'whenever any or the Unlt?tl
States notes are presented for redemption
In gold, and are redeemed In gold, uiMi
notes shall be kept and set apart, and only
paid out In exchange tor gold,' is but an
indirect method or retiring the green'ia .ks.
The Dingley tarirr, having failed to yield a
sniplus though the greenbacks could be
gathered and held in the Treasury, It be
comes necessary Tor tho Administration,
iu oider to carry out the obvious policy of
tlie most influential clement of tlte party,
to provide a method by which the groin
backs can be taken from circulation. The
message docs not suggest the bold and
easily understood method of converting the
Treasury notes into lionds, but most clear
ly and unmistakably Indicates a policy
which -would accomplish the same pur
poce,saA e and except the Government vill
not have to pay interest. Should Cougnss
act on this suggestion, it would be an
Invitation lo those who desire, tho retire
ment of the greenbacks, to present them
at once to the Treasury, and demand th"Ir
redemption in gold. In such a case, it
would be hard to imagine a condition under
which the gold would be returned tei tlie
1 reasury and grccnbicks demanded fir it.
Of course, no. Pemocrat who .stands upon
the Chicago platform could accept j.ny
sucb policy." ' -
Mr. Bland said- "On the currency ques
tion the President Is especially apologetic,
giving excuses why the Republican party
has heretofore failed and is likely to do
nothing at the present session of Con
gress to relieve the people. In dealing
with the gold redemption fund, he admits
the Impossibility of maintaining the gold
redemption, except by Issuing bonds from
time le lime, to be sold for gold, in. oider
to maintain the gold reserve, but, in order
to relieve this difficulty, he would hold
in the Treasury all greenbacks and other
Government obligations, redeemable in gold,
