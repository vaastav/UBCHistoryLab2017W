War on Austria is Called for by President in His Message to Congress
FULL TEXT OF
TO CONGRESS AS READ
BY PRESIDENT WILSON
December 4, 1917.
Gentlemen of the Congress: Eight
months hare elapsed since I last baft
the honor of addressing J'0"- They
have been months crowded with
rents of Immense and Brave signifi
cance for us. I shall not undertake
to retail or eren to summarise those
events. The practical particulars cf
the part we hare played in them will
be laid before you In the reports of
the Exeeutire Departments. I shall
discuss only our present outlook uron
these rast affairs, our present duties;
and the immediate means of ac
complishing the objects we shall hold
always la view.
I shall not to back to debate the
causes of the war. The intolerable
wrongs done and planned against us
by the sinister masters ot Germany
.hare Ions; since become too crossly
Obvious and dilous to erery true
American to need to be rehearsed. But
I shall ast -you to consider again and
with' a rery grave scrutiny our ob
jectives and the measures by which
we mean to attain them; for the pur
pose of discussion here in this place1
U action, and our action must more
straight toward definite ends. Our
object is. of course, to win the war:
and we shall not slacken or suffer
ourselves to be dlrerted until it is
won. But It Is worth while asking
and answering the Question, When
hall we consider the war won!
From one point of view it is not
necessary to broach this fundamental
matter. I do not doubt that the Amer
ican people know wirt the war Is
about and what sort ot an outcome
they will regard 'as a realisation of
their purpose In it As a nation we
... ..nit., in snlrit and intention. I
pay little heed to those who tell me
otherwise. I hear the voices ot dls-
. .k An not? I hear the criti
cism and the clamour of the noisily
at.-..htiaa nnd troublesome. 1 also
Me men here and there fling them
elres in Impotent disloyalty against
the calm. indomitaDie power m ..
nation. I hear men debate peace who
understand neither its nature nor the
way in which we may attain it with
uplifted eyes and unbroken spirits.
But I know that none of these speaks
for the nation. They do not touch the
lieart of anything.
They may safely
iJlVft tn strut their uneasy hour and
. fnrsrotten.
But from another point of view I must also deliver the peoples of Aus
t.'Ieva that it is necessary to say trla-Hungary. the peoples of the Bal-
plainly what we here at the seat of
action consider the war to be for
and what part we mean to play in
the settlement of its sesrchlng Issues.
"We are the spokesmen of the Ameri
can people and they have a right to
know whether their purpose Is ours.
They desire peace by the overcoming
ot evIL by the defeat once for all of
the sinister forces that Interrupt
peace and render it impossible, and
they wish to know how Closely our
thought runs with theirs and what
action wo propose. They are Impa
lant with those who desire peace by
stay" sort of compromise deeply and
Indignantly impatient but they will
Tm equally impatient with us If we
do not make It plain to them what
oof objectives are and what we are
planning for in seeking to make con
quest of peace by arms.
I believe that I apeak for them
when I say two things: First, that
this intolerable Thing of which the
nasters of Germany have shown us
the ugly face, this menace of com
blned Intrigue and force which we
now see eo clesrly as the German
power, a Thing without conscience or
honor or rapacity for convenanted
peace, must be crushed and, if It be
not utterly brought to an end, at
least shut out from the friendly In
tercourse of the nations: and, second,
that when this Thing and its power
are indeed defeated and the time
comes that we can dlsruss peace-
hen the German peopl- have spokes
men whose word we can believe and
when those spokesmen are ready in
the name of their people to accept
tha common judgment of the nations
as to what shall h-nceforth he the
hases of law and of covenant for
the life of the world we shall be
willing and glad to pay the full price
for peace, and pay it tingiudclngly.
"We know what that price will be. It
will be full. Impartial justlre Jus
tice done at every point and to every
nation that the final settlement must
affect, oar enemies as well ss our
friends.
Tou catch, with me, the voices of
humanity that are in the air. They
grow dally more audible, more ar
tlculatr, more persuasive, and thy
eeme from the hearts of men every
where. They Insist that the war shall
uot end in vindictive action of anv
klnd. that no nation or people shall
fc. rnhhed or minlshed because th- Ir-
responsible rulers of a single c-oun- ,i- impossible to admit them to the part
try have themselves done deep and lernflhip of nations which must henceforth
abominable wrong. It Is this thought i guarantee the world's peace. That part
that has b-en expressed In the f orm- j nershlp mut be a partnership of po
ula 'No annexations, no contributions. 1 pies, not a mere partnership of govern
r.o punitive Indemnities." Just because I ments. It might be lmpolhle. also. In
this crude formula expresses the In isuch untoward circumstances, to admit
stlnctive Judgment as to right ori'ermany n tne free economic ini-r-
plain men everywhere It has been
made diligent use of by the masters of
German Intrigue to lead the people
-of Ilussla astray and the people of
every other country their agents
could reach, in order that a premature
peace might be brought about before
autocracy haa been taught Its final
and convincing lesson, and the people
of the world put in control of their
own destinies.
But the fact that a wrong use has
been made of a Just'ldea Is no reason
'Why a right use should not be made
mt It. It ought to be brought under
the patronage of Its real friends. Let It
he said again that autocracy must
first be shewn the uttsr futility of Its
claims to power or leadership In the
snodem world. It Is Impossible to
stpply any standard of justice so long
-s such forces are unchecked and un
ffeatd aa the present maatera of
'TTTnsny command. Hot until that
WIE
A
has been done can night be set up as
arbiter and peacemaker among the
nations. But when that has been
done as, God willing, it assuredly
will be we shall at last be free to
do an unprecedented thing, and this
Is the time to avow our purpose to
do It. We shall be free to base peace
on generosity and Justice, to the ex
clusion of all selfish claims to advan
tage even on the Dart of the victors.
Let there be no misunderstanding, j
Our present and immediate task is to ,
win the war. and nothing shall turn I

plished. Every power and resource
we possess, whether of men. of
money, or of materials, is being de
voted and will continue to be deroted
to that purpose until It is achieved.
Those who desire to bring peace
about before that purpose is achiev
ed I counsel to carry their advlca
elsewhere. We will not entertain It.
We shall regard the war as won only
when the German people say ft us.
through properly accredited repre
sentatlres. that they are ready to
agree to a settlement based upon jus
tice and the reparation of the wrongs
their rulers have done. They have
done a wrong to Belgium which must
be repaired. They hare established
a power over other lands and peoples
than their, own orer the great em
pire of Austria-Hungary, over hither
to free Balkan states, orer Turkey,
and within Asia which must be re
linquished. Germany's success by skill, by In
dustry, by knowledge, by enterprise
we did not grudge or oppose, but ad-
mired, rather. She had built up for
herself a real empire of trade and In-

could not excel the rivals she most
feared and hated. The peace we
make must remedy that wrong. It All these things have been true
must deliver the once fair lands and from the very beginning of this stu
hanDV neooles of Beleium and north- pendous war: and I cannot help think-
era France from the Prussian con-
quest ana me i'russian menace, dui it
leans, and the peoples of Turkey
alike in Europe and in Asia, from the
impudent and alien dominion of the
Prussian military and commercial au
tocracy. We owe it, however, to ourselves to
say that we do not wish in any way
ro Impair or to rearrange the Austro
flungarlan Empire. It Is no affair
of ours what they do with their own
life, either industrially or politically.
We do not purpose or desire to dic
tate to them in any way. We only,
desire to see that their affairs are
left in their own hands, in all mat
ters, great or small. We shall hope
to secure for the peoples of the
Balkan peninsula and for the peopl
of the Turkish Empire the right and
opportunity to make their own lives
safe, their own fortunes secure
against oppression or injustice and
fiom the dictation of foreign courts
or parties.
And our attitude and purpo-e with
regard to Germany herself are of a
like kind. We intend no wrong against
the German Empire, no Interference
with her Internal affairs. We should
deem either the one or the other ab
solutely unjustifiable, absolutely con
trary to the principles we have pro
fessed to live by and to hold most
sacred throughout our life as a na
tion. The people of Germany are being
told by the men whom they now per
mit to deceive them and to art as
their masters that they are fighting
for the very life and existence or
their empire, a war of desperate self
defense against deliberate aggression
Nothing could be mure grossly or
wantonly false, and we must seek by
the utmost openness and randor as
to our real aims to convince th-m or
Its falseness. We are In fact fighting
for their emancipation from fear.
along with our own from the fear
as well aa from the fact of unjust
attack ny neighbors or rivals or
schemers after world empire. No one
is threatening the existence or the
Independence or the peaceful enter
prise of the German Empire.
The worst that can happen to the detri
ment of the German people is this, that
u they shouia still, arter the war is over,
continue to be obliged to lives under am
bitious and Intriguing masters Interested
to disturb the peace of the world, men
or classes of men whom the other peoples

course which must lneiltably spring out
of the other partnerships of a real
peace. But there would be no aggres
sion In that; and such a situation. In
evitable because If distrust, would In the
very nature of things sooner or later
cure itself by processes which would as
suredly set in.
The wrongs, the very deep wrongs,
committed in this war will have to be
righted. That of course. But they can
not and must not be righted by the com
mission of similar wrongs against Ger
many and her allies. The world will
not permit the commission of similar
wrongs as a means of reparation and
settlement. Statesmen must by this time
have learned that the opinion of the
world Is everywhere wide awake and
fully comprehends the Issues Involved.
No representative of any self-governed
nation will dare disregard It by attempt

and compromise as Were entered Into

enthusiasm of the Ilussian people
might have been once for all enlisted
on (he side of the allies, suspicion and
distrust swept away, and a real and
lasting union of purpose effected.
Had thev believed these things at
the very moment of their revolution
and had they been confirmed in that
belief since, the sad revers-s which
have recently marked the progress of
their affairs toward an ordered and
stable government of free m-n might
have been avoided. The Russian peo
ple have been poisoned by the very
same falsehoods that have kept the
German people In the dark, and the
poison has been administered by the
very same hands. The only possible
antidote la the truth. It cannot be
uttered too plainH or too often.
From every point of view, there
fore. It has seemed to be my duty to
speak these declarations of purpose,
to add these speclilc Interpretations
to what 1 took the liberty of sajlng
to the Senate In January. Our en
trance Into the war hai not altered
our attitude toward the settlement
that must come when it Is over.
When 1 aald in January that tho na
tlons of the world were entitled not
only to free pathways upon tho sea.
but also to assured and unmolested
access to those pathways, I wai

What shall we do. then, to push

I.. Its righteous conclusion. e must
clear away with a thorough hand all
Impediments to success and we must
make every adjustment of law that
will facilitate the full and free use
..f our whole capacity and force as
a fighting unit.
One very embarraslng obstacle that
stands In our way Is that wc are at
war with Germany, but n"t with her
alti.. I therefore very earnestly
r.r..mmenri that the Congress Immed
.,.K- ri.elnre the United States
in a
state of war with Austria-Hungary-Hoes
It seem strange to you that
this should be the conclusion of the
argument I have just addressed to
you? It Is not. It is In fact the n
evltable logic of what 1 have said.
Austria Hungary Is for the tm- being
not her own mistress, but .-Imply the
vassal of the German government. e
must fare the fsrts as they are and
act upon them without sentiment In
this stern business. Tho government
of Austria Hungary Is not acting upon
Its own Initiative or In response to
the wishes and feelings of Its own
peoples, but as the instrument of an
other nation. We must meet Its force
with out own and regard th' Central
Powers as but one. The war can be
successfully conducted In no other
way. The same logic would lead also
to a declaration of war against Tur
key and Bulgaria. They also are the
tools of Germany. But they are mere
tools and do not yet stand in the
direct path of our necessary action.

ties of this war carry us, but It seems

as well as men should be included
under the terms of the acts placing

likely that as time goes on many
alien enemies will be willing to be

and It would' be the purpose of the
legislation 1 hae suggested to con
fine offenders snrnng them In penlten
t 'irles and other similar Institutions
Khere they could be made to work as
other criminals do.
Recent experience has convinced
me that the Congress must go further
In authorising the Government to-set
limits to prices. The law of supply
and demand, I am i-orry to say. has
been replaced by the law of unre
strained selfishness While we nave
eliminated profiteering in several
branches of lndusti it still runs
impudently rampant in others. The
farmers, for example, complain with
a great deal of just ire that, while
the regulation of lood prices restricts
their Incomes, no rcstiaints are plsced
upon the prices of most of the things
thev must themselves purrhase: and
similar Inequities obtain on alt sides.
It is imperatively necessary mai
the consideration of the full use of
the water power of the country and
also the consideration of the sys

of the country as are still under the
control of the Federal Cdiernmcnt
fhoiild be Itiumdlately resumed and

supreme moment of history has come.
The eyes of the people have been

is laid upon the nations. He will show
them favor, I devoutly believe, only
If they rise to the clear heights of
Ills own justice and mercy.

Congressman Cooper related to the

he first became acquainted with th,

timate personal history. He said:
I was a railroad engineer a few
years ago. One day coming from the

tabernacle. I heard him from the
outside, and 1 was so greatly im-
pressed by what he ssld that 1 went
the next night to listen to his ser

the Marquis of Lansdowne made, the
mistake of giving the Impression that
weariness of the war should lead to
craven abandonment of the terrible
