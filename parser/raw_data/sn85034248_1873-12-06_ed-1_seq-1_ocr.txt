And we were true to our aneient glory,
And we adiled yet a charm to the stol y

MISCELLANY.
A New Story of IHaroun al Rascbid.
The renowned Caliph rose one morning
in a very mtelancholy humor. He at once
stuinlloned his Grand Vizier. who hastened
to obey. He thus addressed the I'retnier:
"I l.fel very disconsolate ; I had a dreaml
last iight, when I beheld all the women of
my kingdom at the foot of imy throne, be
seecllin.g tlt( to help themt. Their griev
:nt'es were that theovwere unhappy, 1ask
ilmg me to remove their wretchedness ; and
I mustadmit,it is trite, their lot is very
hard."
The Grand Vizier replied : "Sire, I as
sure you that there is no ground for their
comnplaint, :nd tilat among all not one
wotul colisenit to exelunge her coindition."
"I amt aware that toy tministers are al
ways ready to deal in such phrases when
ever they are reproved, that the people
alud their interests are neglected. But I
sw ear by Allah, 1 shall have you strangled
it you do not produce in the sptace of one
ntIlrtth one happy woman. D1o you hear ?
but onie siugle instance out of my whole
kiigdoln. It is certainly a demand of no
grat a hardship. And now you mlay go in
li":tee. :nd I shall expect youtr return after
one month. Blut if you have not com
plied with my conumands by that time,
fear 11y rath."
The Grand Vizier retired disheartened,
as you, nmr gentle readers, may well imn
SW1ile. Ife ait on0'e sought all interview
with the President of the Bagdal police,
fromtti whom Ihe obtainied poor comfort,
wIho expressed a serious doubt whether
one happy woman could be found in
Ilaroun i l Rasehid's entire kingdom-nay
in theis whole world. Leaving hint with a
heavy heart, the Premier undertook the
I'luk himlself, well knowing that his life
wa. at stake. As a mallt ofaaclte unlder
standing, lie comnlenced his inqluiries with
the Sultana. "l) o you expect mie to be
hapipy when the Caliph scarcely devotes
all hour to in.e but instead, walks the
stre-tBall night in distguise. while I mnt.i
ie tilled with constalltt dread of his meet
iltf with some aceitlenlt at any tiime? Do
ont think of it! The very poorest woman
is happier than I am."
The I'relnter, east down, left the palace,
when ie miet a maiden, with blooming
cheeks, carry ing a water-vessel on her heat',
and singinlg merrily as she went. IIe
called to her saving,'" Art thou happv' ?
I hIappy ? Oh. no! I am ats hand soime
as the Sultana, and should like to be in
her place. I would please the Caliph as
well. if he would but direct his attention
toward me."
Again defeated, he left her, coitating
•tpoi new adventtures. Suddenly he
thought of his own wife. anti asked her,
"Are you happy?'," "Happy !" she an
sweret, " with rurh a man ; it would, in
deed. ie a ditielt un(lertatking."
lHe h:a already turned hi hback upon
hier, and was about to try his fortune with
some other ladies of Bagdlad. When the
tu'rther he went the lhvs hopeful he was.
Wherever lie inqinired, nothing but coin
pihd'sts, the samle tittal result. A(ldittted,
that it was rather a peculiar idea to ask
the ladies whether they are happy. Would
thev tell the truthl . The Grand Vizier
thouighlt so. Ill his place I would have se
riously questioned it. lIe went to the
llar!iet-pllae, and there asked an honest
wonsani, a vender of dates. In reply to
his quervy whi.' r she was happy. she
saidd: "hPappy: I happy? No, inideed!
I work from morning early until evening
late and scarcely make a living. I am
obliged to rise <tirly and retire late to my
rest. not having earned enough frequently
to pay for a scanty meal."
Fool that I was, the Minister concluded,
that i should come here to look for happy
people, and quickly went to the house of a!
rich Jewish banker. She certainly must
be happy, reflected the Vizier, she is com
fortably situated. clad in the richest of ap
parel, decked with the mostcostly jewelry,
and surrounded by slaves to do her bidding.!
She knows neither care nor want.
"Alas!" was the reply to the genera
question, turning her hands-ome dark eves
with longing toward heaven, "Sire, I am
the most unhappy of all women in Bag,
dad. My husband loves nought but mot
ney and money matters, leaving his wif4
to her own sadness. A wife is like unto a
flower, but to live and flourish when sups
ported by the majestic palm tree, but, neg
lected and forsaken, as the wife is without
love, she is made to wither."
" By the Prophet, one who loves het
husband with such ardor certainly deserves
to he happy. Where shall I find the de
sired person ?"
The sigh had hardly escaped his breast
when, as if pursued, he ran m great hastt
to the opposite part of the city. There
d\ welt a woman who had been married bu't
two months ago. He exclaimed, " I haver
Ilbud her, I have found her," and entered
the house with joy.
"' Hail to the happy woman," were his
words of greeting, making a low how to
the young wife. and waiting with anxiety
for :ani answer.
" Happy, I happy?" replied the young
bride. shrugging her shoulders, "Oh, nu.
no longer; my husband gives me not a
moment's peace. He cannot bear to leave
me alone for an instant. I know he loves
me, but he repeats the story too otten,and
if a pause does ensue, he thereupon ex
pect: me to begin. Lie swears sonicme thou
sand times a day that he loves me, yea, he
seals it with the most awful oaths, and
seems not to be satisfied until I join with
him in a like strain. At first this little
game was quite pleasant, but now-"
The ill-fated Minister now began to des
pair. He abandoned his search in the Capi
tal, and was now determined to try the
country. But despite of his zeal, he there,
too. did not succeed-could not discover
the precious pearl demanded by the Caliph.
Besides, the time alloted was nearly at an
end, and lie had but one village more to
explore. When about entering it, lie ob
served a peasant and his wife in the field.
The latter was crying aloud because her
husband had struck her. The Vizier sep
arate(d them, and said to the man, " It is
not right that we should render our wives'
lives miuserable."
"I miserable, I unhappy!" exclaimed
the woman; "on the contrary, I am very
happy."
"But did I not see your husband strike
you?"
" True, he does strike me at times, but
it matters not; he is able, also, to protect
me with a strong arm."
"' Then you admit to know what it is to
be happy ?"
"Most certainly; I am perfectly happy."
The Grand Vizier, now relieved of his
heavy burden, exclaimed: "Finally, final
ly. I have found one happy woman !" and
hlie triumphantly took her to Bagdad.
Appearing with his conquest before the
Caliph, the latter said: "Well, you have
found a happy woman?"
"Yes iudeed, Sire."
" Oh, mighty Caliph," exclaimed the
peasant's wife, at his feet, "have mercy
upon me miserable."
" What is that!" the Grand Vizier be
came frightened, saying, "Did you not tell
me that yout were happy ?"
" Yes, at home with my husband and
children, fr'om whom you have torn me
aw-y. How is it possible that I should be
ha iy at this place so far aay from
them ?"
"Be at ease," Haroun al Raschid ad
dressed his Premier, with amalicious smile
on his countenance, "I F pardon you; bfor,
during your absence, I have discovered a
happy woman even here in Bagdad."
Opening his eyes widely, the Vizier
asked, " Here in Bagdad ?"
"Yes; your own wife. I sent a page to
ask her, in my name, whether she was
happy."
SAnd what did she answer ?"
"She answered : ' Of course I am happy,
my husband being on a journey.'"

A Merchant- on Farming.
The followinm is an extract from an ad- e
dress by Elliot . Cowdin before the West- u
chester county (N. Y.) Agricultural So
ciety:
"It has been my lot as an active mer
chant, to mingle with men in almost
every station of society, in ntany of the
nations of Europe; and I am conviniedi t
that no class in any country of the world
is so thoroughly indeplendent, possess so
many real comforts, and have so little
cause for anxiety a:ud discontent connected
'Wtith their voeation, as the iarmers of
A.merica. Always an honorable pursuit.
tlarming is remunerative when properly
orosecuted; and as a general rule, it is
iuore universally successful than any other t
talling. You may question this statement
until you carefully consider it.
"Let me say to our young men, he not
envious of the merchant or the banker of I
the bustling city; but rather bear in mind t
that of all who chase after wealth along
the slippery paths of commerce and fi
nance, scarcely more than one in a hun
dred reach opulence, a few more obtain a
colmpetency in season for old age, while
nine-tenths miserably fail ere they have
fairly started in the race, and for the most
ipart, die poor.
"Neither let our young men be lured
from rural life-its duties and its dignities.
fits toils and its rewards-by the glittering
bauble ot the learned professions. Law
iyers, physicians and clergymen, at the
vcry best, lead laborious lives. The great
bhody of, these are mere drudges-hard
working men, who pursue the noiseless
tenor of their way, and gain a bare sub
sistence. If any of them rise above the
counmon mass, it is usually the result of
years of intense study and tireless applica
tion to their one pursuit, which, unless
they area marvel of good luck, will surely
undermine their health, and very likely
aflord nothingto leave to their heirs except
that prolfessional fame which is among the
most evanescent of earthly possessions.
Labor throughout the universe, is the es
tablished order of things.
" The successful farmer must observe,
study and try. Like all other pursuits,
he gains by whit he does with eye, brain
and hand. IIe must not only accumulate
facts with care, but trace them to their
original source, examine their relations to
other facts, and then skillfully apply them
to the particular case before him. He
must niever forget that his avocation is an
art and a science, and like other arts and
sciences is governed by the law of pro
gress. Alas, how many farmers cultivate
the soil to-day just as their ancestors tilled
it generations ago, and usually for no bet
ter reason than their great grandfathers
set the example which they blindly fol
low."

out the bad effect of the postpone

THE CUBAN OUTRAGE.
A Cabinet meeting was ld Nov. 14, at
which the Cuban massacres were fully dis
cussed, and it is stated that the members
were a unit in expressing their opinion that
the Government should at once take steps
to avenge the outrage committed by the
Spanish authorities in Cuba upon the
Virginins prisoners. A correspondent
at Washington telegraphs: "It can be
stated on official authority, that while the
present naval preparations do not mean
war against Spain or Cuba, they are sisg
niticant of the determination of this Gov
ernmnent to protect American interests at
any hazard, and to prevent in the future
such measures as those which followed the
capture of the Virginius, and which shock 1
the entire civilized world. The paticnce
of the Government seems to be exhauistehi
and as nothing eflietive can be delpndecl
upon from the Spanish Government, not
withstanding its friendly feelings toward
the United States, the law of self-protect
ion is recognized by our Governlment as
applicable to the present condition of
allairs."
The United States steamship Kansas
sailed from the Brooklyn Navy Yard on
Nov. 14 for Santiago de Cuba. She is fully

Thomas H. Pearce, the American consul
at Kingston, Jamaica, was inl Washington
on Nov. 1;, and had a long interview with
Secretary Fish. IHe stated that Capt. Fry,
of the Virginias, appeared before hiem at
Kingston the day before sailing and made
oath to hiis citizenship and to the correct
ness of his papers, which, of course, were
captured with the a@ssel. Mr. Pearce stated
that he had two interviews with Capt. Fry
in regard to his expedition, and protested
against his undertaking it, and gave it a
his opinion that if the Spaniards captured
him lhe would surely be shot, and that ev
ery man in the ship took his lifei in his
hand when he joined the expedition. To
these protects Capt. Fry replied that the
Spaniards could not sot sloot im ; that it
would only be a case of block:ile rmuning,
and as he had been a Confederate blockade
runner. lie reasoned that as the United
States did not shoot prisoners captured in
this business the Spaniards would not do it.
A dispatch was received from Jamaica
Nov. 14, stating that on the 10th the re
mainder of the Virginius prisoners. otne
hundred and eight in dall, were hot at San
tiago de Cuba. A Hlavana dispatch, same
date, stated that the trials of the prisoners
had all been concluded, and that only the
lives of eighteen would be spared. A Cien
fuegos jourtnd ofsamue date states that fifty
seven of the Virginius crew had been shot
on the 10th. These dispatches, though
conflicting in details, leave no doubt that
the Cuban authorities have concluded their
bloody work by a wholesale tnassacre of
the prisoners in their hands.
The London journals generally atdmit
that the Virginius massacre must bring
about the annexation of Cuba to the
United States.
It is sail that sixteen of tile irgniuus
victims were British subjects.
According to a Washington dispatch of
Nov. 17, the President in a recent colver
sation relative to Cuban matters had ex
pressed himself as follows: " This Gov
ernment had thus far acted on such fact
as had reached it, and was now engaged t
in collecting from all available sources,
further information concerning the cap
ture of the Virginius and particulars at
tending the revolting executions which
followed that event. It was desinable that
all information should be of such a clarao
ter as would leave no doubt whatever as
to its reliability. It was essential that we
should be prepared to maintain our posi
tion. He shared with the public their de
numciation of the capture on the high seas
of a vessel sailing with regular clear
ance, and under the United States flay.
and the startling events which so ugnick
ly followed. Spain never having
considered the island of Cuba in a
state of war, and there being no pro
clamation by the United States according
belligerent rights to insurgetits, the Vir
ginius, if reguhhrly cleared for the Island
of Cuba, had a right to enter lavana, or
any other open port of its possessions.
This Government did not recognize aly
right on the part of Spain, in the present
state of affairs, to interfere in any manner
with our merchant ships upon the seas.
except the usual right in her own ports,
and within one marine league of the coast
of any of her dominions; and of this fact
she is aware, as a matter of course. It is
the determination of this Government to
protect its own citizens in all their rights,
and compel respect to her flag. The pres
ent naval preparations were with this view,
not to initiate war by the President, that
power being vested in Congress, but to be
prepared for all possible contingencies.
Upon the meeting of Congress all facts in
the possession of the Executive depa:rt
ment relative to Cuba would be laid before
I that body. with such recommendations as
the occasion might demand.

A Cuban Account of the Capture of
the Virginius.
The New York Times' special corres- s,
pondtlet at lavanua, on Nov. 17 tele- it
graphed to that paper the following ac- h
count of the capture of the Virginius, and
the subsequent trial and execution of her
oflicers and crew:
The Tornado, which made the capture, w
was cruising on the 3Il.t of October, tlnder
sail, about eighteen miles from the Cuban et
coast, when she sighted a steamer about ¶
six miles distant heading toward her. The g
captain at once ordered steam to be got
ui, and soon observed that the strange n
.tceamer had alt.ered her course land headed
for the coast of .Jamaica, distant about one a
hundred miles. The Spanish captain at a
o,(e suspected froml this unusual pro- ti
ecedingi that the steamer was the Vir- C
inius1 and lhe ordered steam ,rot up on n
all the eungines, and to drive them at their I
utmost speed. The Tornado, under full if
headway, showed suchl specd that it was E
clear, in a loung chase, she wdrldd certainly
overhalul the stranger. She ga'inied steadi- h
ly. but as night was coming the Spanish It
captain fiared he would lose sight of the v
vessel. The moon rising, however, lie t
was enabled by keeping all lhauds on deck ii
at the mast-head and in the rigging p
keep a sharp lookout. The steaumer was h
kept in sight until the corvette had neared "
sutlicientlv to blring her guns to bear s
on her. The scene on deck among the
Spaniards way one of intense excite
ment, the fugitive steaumer-for it
was now quite evident that, for *what
ever reason, she was very anxiiolu to es
cape-was observed to ticrow her cargo a
overboard, and lempty boxes and other ma
terial floated past the Spaniard. A shot
vwas fired, but the stranger made no reply,
and four others were tired in succession.t
The Iast shot was tired at 10 p. m.. and imin
mediately the steallr, which had led the
corvette a chase of nearly eight hours,
hove to. Two boats were lowered and
manned and pulled alongside. They met
no resist; ding the steamn ,
which they had iow discovered beyond
doubt to be the Virginius. They took
possessioii of her by hauling down the
American flag which the Virginius
had displayedt throughout the chase,
and hoisted the Spanish flag in
-tead. Captain Fry of the Virginius,
in the usual maniner handed over the 1
steamier's papers for the examination of the
ollicer in coiandl of the ioarding plarty,
and that officer at once took charge of theln
and both vessels headed for Santiago de
Cuba. On the first of November at 5
o'clock p. ni. they arrived at that port.
L'roceedings were immediately begun
against the captives as pirates, and riot
withstandiing the protest of the Unitedi
States Vice-Consul at that port, they were
e condemned, and on the morning of the 4th
of November four were shot. A naval
court-nm' tial was then organized for the
trial of Captain Fry and the crew of the
Virginius, and they were of course
condemned .after a most expeditious
1 trial, and on the 7th, the captain, first
mate, second nmate, and thirtyv4fur seamen
were shot. On the 8th twelve of those
called "expeditionists" were shot, and on
- the 10th fifty-seven more were put to
i death. The latest report from Santiago de
t Cuba is that eighteen only of the entire
ship's company, consisting originally of
169i, will be .saved. Some of these are en
riineers, andl it is assumlied tllhy were not
aiware of the nature of the voyage, and
others are sailors. Only four. it is now
stated, will escape without suffering some
form of punishment, and the remainder of
those not shot will be coideined to tlh
chain-gang.
Wealthy Speculators fuined.
All of the wealthy speculators who for e
years have operated in stocks, have been
wiped out by the decline. There is coise
quently no one to uphold and sustain the
market. Of the crippled wealthy specula- L
tors James Banker was the chief. Begin- A
ning life as a poor boy, he was "' coached" I
by Commodore Vanderbilt until his in
come became between ~300.000 and $400,
000 annually. He scattered his money b
with a most lavish hand, making princely
bequests to his relatives and friends. It is t
not long ago that he presented to his sis- e
ter, Mis. Judge ýlS n;, a brown stone f
front house up-towit for which he paid
$100,000. To-day he is compelled to make s
over all his property to Commodore Van- "
derbilt to insure the latter against losses
brought on by his own speculations. Dan
iel Drew, who has operated so largely in
years gone by, has been (so report says) I
wiped out. Richard Schell, one of the re- I
cognized bulls for years. has gone under.
Stockwell, the noted Pacific Mail manipu
lator, has collapsed. John Stewart, akin g
pin in the speculative ring, has been. re
ports say, cleaned out. And so I might
continue to name one heavy speculator af
ter another that has bet n swept under by
the present financial storm. The with
drawal of these men from the speculative
mart takes large schools of snmaller tish
who have been accustomed to follow in
their wake, and have been crippled along
with them. As a resilt, the street is
pretty well ole ned of speculators, and the
brokers predict that there will be little or
no speculation until an entirely new set of
men make their appear:mnce in the market.
