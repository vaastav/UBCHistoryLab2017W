Deputies and to the country
New York, Nov. 28.—The Tribune has an
editorial on the Mormon question, from which
the following points are gleaned. The time
is close at hand when the population of the
Territory will be so large that to refuse Utah
admission as a State will look like an arbitra
ry and unjust departure from well established
precedent, and there will be practical incon
venience also, in continuing the present
method of administration. The Democratic
party has for the moment something to gain by
the admission of Utah.
Two Senators and one Representative to be
elected under a State constitution would cer
tainly be Democratic. Three electoral votes
of the new State would be a gain to the Dem
ocratic candidate. If the election of Presi
dent be thrown iuto the House, the vote of
Utah will count them as much as the vote of
New York. It is not to be supposed that the
Democrats at Washington are insensible of
these conditions.
Polygamy cannot be abolished unless it is
broken up 'by the National authority while
Utah is still a territory. Nobody doubts that
under State government crime would be le
galized and perpetuated. It is polygamy
which erects what is practically a foreign
State in the midst of the American continent,
ruled by a community which has no sympa
thy with the Union, no respect for its laws,
no interest in its prosperity. The American
people never will consent to the erection ol
Utah as a State until the barbarous practice
which divides it from the whole Christian
world has been forever abolished. And be
fore there can be any serious question ot ad
mission, laws against polygamy must be

Louisville, Ky., Nov. 28.—A fearful tor
nado played havoc in the southeastern por
tion of the city. This morning a terrific gale
struck the city at the end of Fourth tsreet, the
Rev. Stuart Robinson's house being one of the
first to sutter, thence it continued in a north
easterly direction through the city to Cass

all blown down. The old Louisville base
ball park is completely riddled, not the least
portion of the fence was left standing except
half of the east side . The root of the grand

New Orleans, Nov. 28 __Before the com
mittee to-day, J. M. Jewett testified as to the
contradictory testimony of Houser about
Blanchard and himself, relative to their going
to Governor Kellogg's house with the returns
and working on them there. The reason why
the registration books were taken to the Cus
tom House was because the evidence to which
both parties referred was in the office of the
United States Supervisor, and why the regis
tration books were taken to the Custom House
was for a similar reason. The Supervisor of
Registration was Clerk of the Circuit Court
and had his office in the Custom House.
H. C. Brown, a discharged employe of the
Internal Revenue office, testified that Harris
Marks told him some time last summer at his
private office when they were alone, that he
could not take care of any of his own friends
whilst this fight was being made on Keilogg ;
that he had appointed curs to keep them from
squealing on Kellogg. Paul Trevigne, clear
ance clerk in the Custom House, testified that
Milon came to him very indignant at the ru
mor that he (Milon) had made affidavit
against Kellogg and got him to wiite a letter
to Kellogg denying the rumor.
Milon signed the letter which was put In ev
idence yesterday. The contrast of signatures
showed that Milon did not sign the so-called
affidavit.
New Orleans, Nov. 28.—J. T. Allyn,
Manager of the Western Union Telegraph
Company, was recalled. Senator Hill stated
that telegrams produced by him before the
committee, appeared to belong exclusively to
Kellogg. When the witness had been re
quested to produce all telegrams to and from
Kellogg, the witness answered that he had
complied literally with the written demands
served upon him, which said all tele
grams to Wm. P. Kellogg. Senator Hill then
requested the witness to produce all telegrams
from Kellogg. Witness replied that it was
impossible to do so, as all May and June bus
iness had been shipped to New York last
Tuesday, by order of Superintendent Merri
wether. Senator Hill asked if this had been
done to get the dispatches out of the way of
the Committee. The witness replied that it
might be, as the policy of the company was
not to expose the business of its customers if
it could be avoided. The Chairman asked
if the witness did distinctly understand him to
direct the witness to bring all telegrams to
and from Kellogg. The witness replied, "ver
bally, yes, sir, but your written instructions
said only all telegrams to Kellogg." The
chairman said he had intrusted the prepara
tion of written instructions to Spofford's coun
sel. Senator Cameron said that although
the witness was no lawyer, he evidently had
intelligence enough to know that a written
order supercedes all verbal instructions.
Chairman—I desire to say to you, Mr. Wit
ness, that you escape only under the letter of
the law, and you have violated the spirit of
law.
When the committee returns to Washing

Washington, Nov. 29.—The President
appointed Major Thomas P. Morgan, at pres

missioner to fill the vacancy caused by the
resignation of Seth L. Philips.
A special from San Antonio to the Galves
ton News, says the Indians are reported de
predating the country one hundred miles west
of El Paso, Texas. A party of fifteen men
went iu pursuit and followed the trial to Can
deleria Mountain, when the Indians am
bushed them, killing all but one or two.
When the news reached the town a strong
party organized, and started on the trail, anil
when tiiey arrived at the scene of the massa
cre commenced to bury the dead. While thus
employed they were fired upon and 18 killed.
The Indians were apparently armed with
Sharpe's Rifles, and are supposed to be fre
quenters of the United States reservation. A
large force has been organized for the punish
ment of the Indians.
Washington, Nov. 28.—The Notional

i OI C01 • • «
Republican to-morrow publish pur
ports to be on outline of some of the features
contained in Secretary Sherman's forthcoming
report. The report was offered for sale on
the streets to-night, and it will be printed to
morrow in New York, Cincinnati and Chi
cago.
This fact was brought to the Secretary's
attention, but he declined to give out the doc
ument for general publication, saying that he
would not be a party to any irregularities by
which the report was published prior to its
presentation to Congress.
The Republican will say the forthcoming
annual message was made public in a restrict
ed and surreptitious manner yesterday. It is
said the recommendations contained therein,
while they are acknowledged to be of great
importance, are so conservative as to avoid
attention to any direct shock in financial cir
cles or disturbance in commercial affairs. It
is understood that the Secretary does not go
so far in his recommendations regarding the
national currency as the President does in his
message, for lie does not suggest an actual
retirement of greenbacks. He maintains that
the national banking system shall be retained
and encouraged as a legitimate aid to the
government in supplying currency for the
general publie, and also as a legitimate line of
personal or private business enterprise ; but
he recognizes the necessity and availability of
an interehangable currency such as the green
back system furnishes, and does not advise
any retirement iu the issue ot government
notes.
The repeal of the legal tender act is dis
cussed at length, and it is suggested or recom
mended that the effect of the adoption of the
suggestion, as explained to the National Re
publican by a prominent banker who heard
the report yesterday, would be to compel an
xplicit understanding in regard to connner
greenbacks are now at par, and will remain

Tlie same paper, in to-morrow's issue, re
ferring to its alleged synopsis of the Fresi-|
dent's message, which was published yesterday '
morning, will say : "As to tlie omissions in
our synopsis there are tlie best of reasons for
! believing that there are several. They refer
j to the international exhibition progressing at
Melbourne, Australia, tills year, and to be

Referring to the condition of affairs in
Alaska, the President alludes to the appear
ance and interference of the British vessel
Osteria at Sitka during the troubles in that
vicinity last spring and then recommends the
immediate establishment of Territorial judi
cial? in Alaska. Practically this recommen
dation amounts to suggestions for the execu
tion of a regular territorial form of govern
ment. The reasons advanced to support this
suggestion are in effect that the interests of
economy will be served by prompt trials of
offenders against the laws of the United
States in the Territory where their crime
maybe committed. Under the present sys
tem prisoners and witnesses are transported
at great expense to Oregon and California
where such trials are now held. This occa
sions great delay as weli as expense, both of
which would be ayoided by the organization
of a local judiciary as suggested.
Ex-Senator Ramsey, of Minnesota, is ex

Buffalo, Nov. 28. —The body of Thomas
Russell, of St. Charles, Mich., a sailor belong
ing to the barge Walton, was found floating
in Buffi.lo creek this morning, bearing evi

in. His face and head were horribly disfig

Andrew McKenzie, of Detroit, master of the
barge, has been arrested on suspicion.
Los Pinos, Nov. 28. —The portmonie of
Mrs. Meeker, containing $31, taken from her
by Douglass at the time of her capture, was
returned this morning. Douglass sent it in
by a runner to Chief Ouray, who delivered it
to Agent Adams.
All investigation was stopped this morning
by runners from the White River Utes, who
stated that runnel's from the Uintah Utes say
that troops were moving to the Uintah Agen
cy to maire prisoners, and that ail the Uintah
Utes had left for the camps of the White
River Utes, who now refuse to come in until
assured that this is not true. The Indians
have been informed by the United States that
this report is false, and that the troops are
instructed not to advance during the present
negotiations. An advance of troops would
close any further business here. Ouray thinks
the story is an invention of the Mormon ele
ment who are doing all in their power to cre
ate serious trouble. This will delay the com
mission six days until the White River Utes
return from the Uintah Agency.
(Signed) Hatch, Commissioner.
Inquiries m official quarters fully confirm
Gen. Hatch's assurance to the Indians that
the report of the advance of troops is wholly
untrue. Secretary Schurz has for some time
expected that some adverse element was se
cretly at work to retard, or, if possible, defeat
the reports of the commission, and he is
strongly inclined to believe that the source of
the present trouble is correctly indicated by
Ouray.

Windsor, Vt.. Nov. 28. —Magoon, when

He then predicted that within three years tins'
would know who killed Streeter. He com
plained that injustice had been done him in
not being reprieved for a year that the case
might be presented to the Legislature and a
new trial granted. While speaking he trem
bled violently and shed tears. After seating
himself he was bound and assisted to the drop
by deputies.
Atchison, Ks., Noy. 28. —Jay Gould and

this morning started west over the Central

Gould party will go to the end of the line
and may also inspect some of its branches.
There is a great deal of interest throughout

this State as to Gould's purposes. He now
controls nearly fifteen hundred miles of rail
way within the limits of Kansas, or fully one
half of the total mileage of the State. The
roads that have passed under his control are
only lines traversing a large section of the
State and the completion of which is practi
cally destroyed, lieuce this combination has
it in its power to do great injury to Kansas
interests or great good as it may elect. The
journals of the State are generally reticent in
expressing opinions upon the subject, but all
manifest the uneasiness almost universally
prevalent among the people concerning this
gigantic concentration of railway interests in
the hands of the combination.

There was much speculation in the lobbies
of the Palais Bourbons last evening over the
situation in regard to the ministry. It is the
general opinion that its priestage is shaken.
Some influential members of the Left think
that a new Cabinet with Gambetta as Primier

to be that the present ministers will remain

Sligo, Nov. 27.—Mr. John Rea, counsel
for Killen, was constantly interrupted during
bis cross examination of witnesses, yesterday,
by the several magistrates of the court,
who pointed out that his remarks were totally
irrelevant. The examination lasted over four
hours and embraced every variety of topic,
including politics, polemics and adventure, in
all of which Rea was poor.
It is generally believed in London that if
the release of the Irish prisoners on bail is
not allowed by the exhibition o anything
like intolerable defiance, the tr w Dnot be
at once pressed forward. It is thought that
an exhibition of the authority of the law has
already done good, which might be dissipated
it the government pressed the trials and failed
to obtain conviction.
Darrit is confident of acquittal if tried at
the coming assizes here, but declares that if
his trial baremoved to the court of Queen's
bench in Dublin, he will not expend a farth
ing for counsel, securing of witnesses, etc., as
lie is convinced the crown is determined to
inflict another year's imprisonment upon him.
In tlie trial of Killen to-day, Mr. Rea, his
counsel, in cross-examining police witnesses,
asked absurd and irrelevant questions, pro
voking frequent altercations with the magis
trate, who pointed out that he was keeping
his client in duress while he amused the au
dience. The only fact at all material to the
issue which he elicited, was that in the mat
ter of short-hand writers, while agreeing
upon main points, differed somewhat as to de
tails. Mr. Rea, during the temporary absence
of the magistrates, harrangued the audience,
:
1
of the magistrates, harrangued
telling them he had been threatened with im
prisonment for contempt, and had received a
letter threatening him with assassination.
After a long cross examination by Rea of
the witnesses for the prosecution in the trial
of Killen, the case for the crown was closed.
Rea then commenced a rambling defense, in
the midst of which the court adjourned for
the day.
Paris, Nov. 27.—In opening the session of
the Chamber of Deputies to-day, Gambetta
congratulated the house on the restoration to

"This restoration," he said, "will rendercloser
the bonds of national unity, and it attested
the confidence placed in tlie good sense and
patriotism of the people of Paris." Gambet
ta besought tlie Chamber to forego all useless
and passionate scenes, and concentrate its
efforts on securing the grandeur of tlie
country and strengthening the republic.
Deputy Hauntjon questioned the govern
ment relative to measures for the relief of
sufferers from the commercial crisis. He
moved that public works be pushed, anil that
the import duty on grain he abolished.
Tirard, Minister of Commerce, replied that
the government will promptly consider all
proposals to ameliorate the condition of tlie
population of the republic. Tlie order of the
day, pure and simple, was then voted on.
London, Nov. 28.—At Siigo to-ilay the
magistrates decided that the evidence which
Rea proposed to call in favor of Killen was
irrelvent, and decided to close tlie case and
commit Killen for trial admitting him to bail.
Killen refused to leave the court, and had to
be carried out. Tlie court was then ordered
to be cleared, but Davitt and Rea remained in
defiance of the order. When tlie telegram
containing the above particulars was dis
patched Killen was in jail and Rea was ad
dressing an excited crowd.
