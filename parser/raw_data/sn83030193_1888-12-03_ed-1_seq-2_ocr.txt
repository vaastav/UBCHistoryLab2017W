' ' If tho animal is mentally distressed, it
would bo an act of mercy to havo him killed."
ho said. " I know of numerous instances
where dogs and other animals havo grown so
attached to a person, that after tbe death ot
tho master or mistress thoy actually died of a
broken heart. In such cases. I ropeat, it
would be an act of morcy to kill the oulmal."

" He seems to have gotten over his prlof
and will come around nil right. If he had
kept up his whining, however, I should cer
tainly have killed him. Ab it is, he won't live

OH, JOHNNY IS NOT SCARED.
e
FROM THE PRESENT OUTLOOK DIB FUTURE
SEEMB ASSURED. ,
Practical Pollllelnns Appreciate Mr. O'Brien
and Ills Methods, While the Police Com
mUslonern Cannot Agree n to Ills Hnc
ceesor He and Ills tJood Friends Have
Tranquil Heart.
Ono of tho amateur politicians of the G.O.P.'s
County Committee, which proposes to discipline
the leaders of tho Eighth Assembly District
machine, thought ho had hit upon a very clcvor
scheme, for reorganizing tho district, with
O'Brien. Ilourke, Brodsky and tho rost out,
when ho proposed to starve them out.
Ho would create now leaders, endow them
with Federal ofllccs, and with tho assistance of
tho United States Treasury knock out all the
pretensions of O'Brien to leadership.
How effectual this remedy would bo in healing
tho Eighth District ulcer on tho body of tho lto
publican organization may bo inferred when it
Is known that of all tho election district llcpub.
llcan leaders under O'Brien not ono is an office
holder. John J. O'Brien says that this Is a very dovcr
idea, but Alderman-elect Oootz and other of
O'Brien's followers say that tho brain which
conceived it was too small to consider at tho
same timo that Mr. O'Brien has a right to expect
something from Gen. Harrison for his sorvicos
in behalf of the National ticket.
Col. JoclB. Erhardt and John W. Jacobnsaro
tbo two ltepubllcans prominently named to suc
ceed Hans ti. Bcattlo as Uurveyor of the Port of
Now York.
Both these , gentlemen oomplaln that tho
O'Brien machlno slaughtered them in the Eighth
District, and the reformers hope to see one of
them Hnrveyor, for then they will bo assured
that not a Hinulo O'Brienito will receive a Cus-tom-Uonse
appointment.
O'Brien, his friends say, is not afraid that ho
will not not his share of publio patronage for
his friends. If tho amateur purist politicians
are against him, ho is assured of the friendship
and recognition of practical politicians like
Tom Piatt and Matt Quay, and both those bid
fair to have a great deal to say regarding tho
distribution of offices.
They value Johnny, his methods and inflnenco
too much to lose him by tho withholding of a
fow minor offices.
With, John Wannamaker for Postmaster
General and Tom Piatt in tho Treasury Depart
ment, Johnny's friends would not lack for
placo.
Humors have been current for a few days
that the Police Commissioners had a secret
meeting and removed O'Brien from his pros,
ent office. Of course. It was a canard.
O'Brien now holds over, and has dono so for
a year, because of o deadlock in tho Police
Board.
Whon tho original civil service list was
sent up L. 8. Mott, a veteran, led the list
and Edward Qilon, a County Democrat, was
next in rank. Johnny went into Court and
had his namo put on tho list.
A voto for a now Chief of the Bureau of
Elections showed that Commissioners French
and McOlava were for Mott, and Voorhls aud
Porter for Oilon. and thero the matter reatad.
Tho- Commissioners cannot romove
O'Brien, as, under the law, he holds over
until his successor is appointed and qualified.
Undor tho present organization of the Board,
there is no liklihood of a now Cniof being se
lected. Tho next hoad of the Bureau will
draw only $1,000 a year, tho Commissioners
having fixed the salary, after the present
Chief retires, at that sum; but Johnny
O'Brien, as a hold-over, receives $5,000 a
year for less than six weeks of actual service.
The term of office of President French ox
plres in May, and Mayor Grant will have the
power to namo his successor. As French and
O'Brien rendered valuable assistance in the
election of Mr. Grant, it is conceded that
Mr. French will Buccoed himself, without
being pledged to appoint a new Chief.
Mr. McOlave will Bervo until May, 1801,
and many peoplo think that a Tammany Hall
Democrat will be his successor, unless the
non-partisan custom prevails, and he, too
is reappointed. Should this, rule be ob
served. O'Brien will continue in business at
the old stand during the Presidential eleotion
of 1892, as heretofore.
An Old Slaveholder Experience.
7Vfiei0la Jftui, WmaMnaton Ltttv.
Lot the lady on my left, who works in the
Patent Offloo, tell a little lifo story i " There
came into our department a few weoks ago, "
said she, " a tall, gaunt man from Southern
Virginia. He once owned a plantation and
many slaves. The war impoverished him.
He didn't know how to work, had Dover
lifted his hand, and concluded he was too
old a bird to learn new tricks. So he drifted
along, barely keeping body and soul together,
just as many of the old aristocracy in that
section havo dono evor since the war. Fi
nally his Congressman secured him a plaoe
bere. and induced him to accept it on the
representation that there was not muoh to do
but draw his salary. The placo was uoh a
one as is usually held by a colored man a
janitor, in fact and bis duties were the mak
ing of fires, sweeping and keeping things in
order. You ought to havo seen the look of
disgust on that man' face whon ho found
what tho work was.
" Why, Bah,' said ho, I never made a fire
n my lite, I nover swept a flo I never
earned how to work, sab."
" And I saw the bitterness coming into his
face, heard it in his tone. He was about to
throw up tbo job. Then one of our type
writer operators, a young woman from New
England, spoke up. Thore was a kindly
look in her eye, a mellow sympathy in her
voice. But she cut straight to the core ot the
matter.
" Look here,1 she exclaimed, ' let me toll
you something. I say it for your own good.
Yon ought to know that the world has gone
past you. We,' and sho pointed to tno busy
olerks in the room, ' don't brag of what we
can't do, but of.wliat we can do.'
" Well, that was a centre shot. It roused
the man. He stood silent as if he were living
all hi lifo over again. Then he npnroaohea
the grate as if to make the fire. But he didn't
know now to go at it, and was about to turn
away in despair when tho yonng woman from
New England stepped forward.
' ' ' Let me show you,' she said ; ' it is 80 easy
when yon know how.'
"Tho upshot of It oil? Yhy. the tall,
gaunt Virginian has become one of the best
janitors in onr building. And the strangest
thing about it is that he likes the work. He
says he has wasted twenty-five years of his
lifo ; that he is now a man again. "
"And is he worried about tho election?
Does he fear for his placo ?"
" No. He half hopes he will lose the job
and have to seek employment elsewhere.
you see, an tno dormant, rusty energy of tbe
man has been awakened, and In his new
life and ambition he feels equal to any.
thing."

a carriage called at tho residence of llov. W. B.

5 Walker street, where a couplo wcro waiting to
bo married. Tho room was neat in appoaranco
but somewhat dark. Besides tho contracting
parties thero wcro two witnesses present. AU had
tho appearance of being rospectablo people. Tho
bridegroom had tho pallor of a sick man on his
cheek, and tho bride was a blondo of good fea
tures, well dressed and qulto prepossessing. No
peculiarity that coidd arouse tho suspicions of
tho minister was detected and they wcro mar
ried. The groom wrote bis namo as Horace

brido signed hor namo as Mrs. Churchill, ago
twenty.nino years, daughter of lttchard Lee. L.

The surprise and sensation appear when it is

He has two sisters rcsldlnir In Fort Plain, who

Mrs. Churchill managed to get htm outside of tbo

called at tho asylum again and asked to visit his
room. Dr. Wagner became suspicious. Bent for
Mrs. Churchill and questioned hor. She stated
that sho was Faulkner's wife, and that she had the
certificate that would prove it. Bho said sho had
licen married to him threo years, but wanted
the fact kept secret until she should elect to di

rows, knew nothing of the matter until after
tho marriago by llov. Mr. Griffith had been per
formed. BInco then ho has seen and examined
tho papers and marriago certificate of Mrs.
Churchill, and has looked at tho law on the sub

Thoro is a large quantity of rice in small bun.
dies, consigned to tho various Chinese mer
chants in tho city. Tho dook was crowded
this morning, a It has been every day since
the ship began unloading, with Chinese mer
chants who have an interest in tbe pile of
good put off tho vessel. Tho United States
customs officora Btand by with their scales
and long testing needles, ready to
catch any attempt at smuggling.
"When one contemplates tho methods in
use to test the goods at the dook he cannot
but think it on easy matter for a Chinaman
to ship opium done up in boxes of tin or
bundles of.rico. 'One box of tea out of every
consignment is taken to tho Appraiser's
office for examination. Tho-rioe is not so
Mandled. A man stands by when a large
undle of the little mats is brought up and
jrans a sharp, noedle-liko instrument throueh
them one by one. Of courao somo of them
escape without direct examination. The work
'is very imperfect. After weeks of it the man
may hecome caroloss, on account of the
monotony of tho method.
Every box of clothing or similar goods is
opened and carefully examined. Seid Back,
tbe prominent Chinese merchort. who always
has his pookets (and a Chinaman's clothingjs
all pockets) stuffed with cigars, was asked tor
his opinion on tbe opportunity to smuggle
opium or other valuablo material subjoct to
duty, by putting it in rice mats or boxes of
tea. The duty on rice is but two and a quar
ter cents per pound, while the Government
charges aro 910 per pound for admitting
opium. Seld Back replied : " It might
be done successfully enough to t
suro. They take only one box out oi
many, but supposo they got the box which
has tbo smuggled stuff In it? Don't you see
that would confiscate the whole consign,
meut. If a box of opium were fonnd in one
packago of my tea or rice I would loso $20,-
000 if I lost a cent. Still, it is dono, but one
takes great risks in doing it. I wouldn't. I'd
rather buy in smugglod opium at the United
States Marshal's salo than run such a risk.
1 eon buy it at Government solo for a
little over S10 a pound, and that's cheaper
than smuggling. I let the other fellow break
the law and make tho money myself."

A BALLROOM TBAOKPT. ,

The story wo are about to relate happened
in this city not many weeks ago. It was kept
out of print at the time out of consideration
for the yonng lady, who has since left the
city. X
It was at a ball. Among the persons pre-
ont was a young lady who hod a great horror f
of snakes, and Imagined no matter what tho ,
reason if she experienced any unusual alarm,
a snake in unpleasant proximity. After dan
cing awhile sho was gteidy disturbed by feel
ing a sensation as though a serpent had fixed,
itself beneath the folds of her dress. i
Grasping the head of tho monster tightly,
she screamed aloud for assistance. A nasty
consultation among the gamest of the ladiea
waa held, when It wnaileaided that a vountr
disciple of Esoulapius, who was present,
should be callod to their assistance. He waa I
quickly on the spot, and being a yonng man
of uncommon courage, was not many mo- '
ments within the circle of half-folnting fe-
moles before ho had caught the tall of the) '
snake and wound it firmly around his hand, f
telling Miss M that she must let go the J
moment he jerked, and to make the act as j
instantaneous as possible.
He told her be would pronounce the words
one, two, throe, and that at the last word she
must let go her hold, and that he doubted I
not that he could withdraw the snake before y
it could have time to strike.
All stood in breathless horror awaiting the
act of life or death, and the moment the
words wero pronounced the young fellow
Jorked out the longest and most diabolical
ooking wire bustle that over was seen. Tho
whole affair was soon explained. The fasten
ing of tho machine had become loose during
tho dancing, and it had shifted its posittion
in such a manner that it dangled about and
induced the wearer to believe that it was a ,
snako with on enormous head. Tho fellow
swooned in his tracks, and couldn't be in. v
duced to attempt the capture of another
snake nnder any ciroumstances. Tho young
lady left the. ball room d la tho Cleveland
stylo, greatly mortified.
