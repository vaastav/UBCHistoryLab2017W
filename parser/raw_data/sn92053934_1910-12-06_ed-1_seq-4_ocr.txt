Old Age Pension.
Little by little the corporations are
beginning to understand that when
they ask an employe to devote his
whole life to their service they ought
to provide for him in old age. or when
he is disabled. The United States
Fteel corporation has taken this mat
ter up and has provided three classes
of pensions for persons who have
spent twenty years or more in its
service.
In the first place, men who have
served this time and have reached the
age of 70 years and women who have
reached 60 years will be retired on
compulsion and bo given pensions that
will reach from $12 a month to $1,200
a year. Those who have worked for
twenty years and have reached the age
of 00 years for men and 50 years for
women 'will be granted a pension on
request.
The corporation has a pension fund
of $8,000,000 and the Carnegie fund
has one of $4,000,000 or that the com
pany has $12,000,000 available for
this purpose.
Where Kveryone Faces Death.
Everywhere in New Guinea the trav
eler is continually brought face to
face with death, and the natives are
devoid of the slightest pity or respect
for the dead or dying, although after
a death they will often wail and
moan for a considerable time. Mur
der l-i an everyday occurrence, and
Eoth'ng could be worse than the
morals of the natives. In fac!, they
have r.one; they thieve and lie with
a persistence and cunning which is
surprising.
The Papuans have a cheerful cus
tom vhich demands a life for a life:
should any one die, at the first oppor
tunity they kill some one they are
not very particular whom to make up
Tor it. While we Mere at Humboldt
Bay, fuys Prof. Pratt, in the Decem
ber Wide World magazine, a Malay
died of dropsy; he was the first Malay
who 'aid ever come to that part, and
the Papuans greatly respected him.
"Very well." they said, "we must
shoot a Malay with our bows and ar
rows to pay for his death." And,
soon?r or later, some innocent person
would be killed to square the account,
when everybody except, presumably,
the victim's friends would be satis
fied. Charity at Christmas Time.
He observes Christmas best who aids
those in distress most. It is the sea
ton with tendencies toward selfish
ness. Its celebration and observance should
be the direct anthesis of selfishness.
It should be a season of extreme liber
ality, of love, kindness, faith, hope and
charity.
There are right here in Rock Island
women and children in want, in sick
fctss. in-ivjetcheiliiess and ia. distress.
There are charitable Institutions and
organizations doing all in their power
to relieve those in want, tocare for
the friendless, to properly rear little
children left orphans, to comfort the
elck, feed the hungry, rescue the per
ishing. Acting in complete cooperation
with this, The Argus, through its Santa
Claus fund, is seeking to do a part.
Contribute to all these causes. Don't
limit your Christmas observance to
making happy folks happier, lavishing
things on those who have more than
they need, or to an exchange of mutual
selfishness, but give to the poor, to the
sick and to the helpless. Make the
little children happy.
If everyone who conveniently can
will do some real work of charity this
Christmas season in Rock Island, no
matter how small that charity may be,
think of the glory of the Christmas ob
servance, contemplate the bright rays
of hope that will be made to shine
into unhappy lives; think of the wom
en and children made happy and made
to feel that Christmas means some
thing that it means humanity and
Christianity.
The President's Message.
In the most voluminous document of
the kind he has sent to congress, and
indeed one of the heaviest state papers
of an advisory nature that has emana
ted from the White house in recent
years. President Taft seeks more than
anything else to apply the soothing
balm to the gaping wounds in his own
party. In the face of the nation-wide
protest that went forth at the Novem
ber elections he still maintains that the
Payne-Aldrich tariff measure is wise
and adequate to meet the requirements
and exigencies of the situation. In
other words, the president thrusts his
fists against the bricks, but still in
sists he does not see the pricks. Ap
parently he does not feci that the peo
ple meant anything in their popular re
buke, and they were merely ill natur
ed and vented their spleen on the re
publican candidates. Thi3 seems from
this distance to be the president's rea
soning. At. all events he does not fa
vor any further "tariff tinkering" at
the present session of congress. le
does ask a vigorous enforcement of
the laws that are on the statute books,
coupled with the most rigid economy
in the conduct of governmental affairs.
He is content with ihe tnrif'f commis
sion already provided for, and urg's
thai it be continued and m.i.ic perma
nent but that there sh::il !e no more
j;enoral revision. Ho comM out strong
ly for ship subsidy which will be bad
nws for Wall street, of course.
He takes the position that the P:-ina-ma
canal should be fortified, and in
this seems to have struck a popular
chord. He holds that the canal may
be completed within a reasonable
'-ntth of time -and asks i'no r.f-cesary
n j-jiroi ; it ions to go on with the work.
The reason of this logic will not be ser
iously questioned.
Th president recommends the sim
plification of judicial procedure to the
end thai litigation may be less tostly
;-r.d morn expedient. The salaries of
federal judges he says should be in
creased. This, too, is wise, and if
.Turieo Technicality could be eliminated
by the operation it would serve a long
way toward expediting the course of
law and stimulating a sadly waning
public confidence in the judiciary, or
at least the administration of justice.
The president recommends a fitting
recognition by congress of the achieve
ment of Commander Peary in discover
ing the north pole, endorsement being
given to the suggestion of the secre
tary of the navy that the intrepid ex
plorer be elevated to the rank of rear
admiral of the navy and placed on the
retired list. This is a very fit and
proper proposition, and the people who
believe in the reward of worth will
hope it may be adopted whether one
Dr. Frederick A. Cook approves of it
or not.
Other than the few instances speci
fied the president devotes the bulk of
bis long message to a renewal of spe
cific recommendations of his former
message to congress. The document
is well written and is free from the
balderdash that was so conspicuously
characteristic of many of the papers
of his late lamented predecessor in the
office of the chief magistracy of the
nation.
Life Lines
BY BASILRl'S.
ENTHUSIASM.
.Copyrighted, 1910.)
Enthusiasm starts up the energy
in the ego of man; it's a lubricant
that oils the machinery, so that the
man in his great stress may reach his
success.
Enthusiasm triumphs; it moves, it
charms, it is the outburst of sincerity
carrying conviction of truth.
Enthusiasm when divine is lasting,
and when combined with faith over
comes all obstacles; it's the "live wire"
highly charged that carries the mes
sages to men.
Enthusiasm helps energy to achieve;
when your battery is well charged
with this devine ecstacy you are good
for a hundred mile run a run fuli
of fun.
The enthusiastic habit is a kind of
a sacred second nature which heaps
happiness upon man; man succeeds in
getting all he needs when he loves to
do.

WASHINGTON. President Taft's forthcoming message to congTesa Is expected to deal at some length with
the Panama Canal. During his recent visit to the Isthmus of Panama the president made a thorough in
spection of the work and expressed great satisfaction at the progress that has been made. In the illustration

ANTI-FOOTBALL ARGUMENTS
OF 1583 AND 1910 SIMILAR.
Ancient Sport Dsscribed as Full of
"Murthering Devices."
Some controversialists who are op
posed to tin? f.air-e f foot br.il will be
interested to know the views of Philip
Stubls. Mr. Stubhs w;is an EuglKb
who wrote a book entitled, "An
iitotvio of Abuses Current In Ye Kenlm
of England." The JiouU was published
i:i lr.vl. and Mr. Stubbs devoted one
whole chapter to the game cf football.
What he said over rii years ago i-:
pntot ieally almost word fcr word wh;t
tho opponents of the game are saying
today. Listen to Mr. Stubbs as he
tells of football iu the sixteenth cen
tury: 'Now who so grosly tilinde that
seeth not that these aforesaid exer-ci-;s

"Sometimes their noses gush with

"l don't see how we can afford to
observe Christmas this yenr, Ileury,"
remarked Mrs. Tidd'eberry two weeks
before that anniversnry. "We've lu.fi
so much fickness and bad luck during
the past twelve months that to make
any gifts will mean getting in debt for
livh:g expenses, and 1 am unwilling to
do that."
Mr. Tiddlebcrty looked up from his
paper with a relieved expression on
his tired face. "I've bceu pondering that
matter for several duys, my dear."
Suddenly the wife looked up and
saw her husband take a iig.tr from
his pocket, regard it speculatively and
th"a, sighing, return it to the case.
"Henry," she snid, "smoke your ci
gar! Ten needn't think you're going
to save on your only consolation just
to buy some foolish nousonse for the
children. How much of your month's
salary will there be after you've laid
aside the amount of the interest due
the first, of tb year?"
"Xoue," confessed her husband can
didly. "Then why should we try to observe
Christmas just as if this year had
been a prosperous one?"
"You have stumped me. Anne. I
hate to give up Christmas, but I guess
we'll have to."
"I'll do the best I can," promised
Mrs. Tiddleberry ,ts she folded up the
stockings. "There will be enough to
eat, but it will be plain. I laid a little
money away for Bob's suit and for
Linnie's new coat, and that will be all
the Chritmas they can have this year.
I can make some black walnut candy
for them and some popcorn."
"You're right, as usual, Anne." and
Mr. Tiddleberry bent to kiss her flush
ed cheek.
When she broke the news to Unnie
and Bob the next day their young
faces grew quite round and solemn, and
she felt a little lump in her throat as
they trudged off to school with a
cheerful "All right, mother, dear."
"They're disappointed enough." she
murmured, "but they won't say any
thing. I'm proud of their pluck."
Sir. Tiddleberry developed a habit of
working late in the city, and each
night found him taking a biter train
to his suburban home until finally be
stamped into the bouse on Christmas
eve just as the clocks were striking 11.
"Henry Tiddleberry," said his wife
severely. "It seems to me the import
ing business is picking up or you're
getting behind with your books. There
must be some reason for your working
late at the office. You never did it be
fore." "There Is an excellent reason, my
dear," said Mr. Tiddleberry amiably
as he hung his overcoat before the
kitchen stove to dry. "which I will ex
plain to you in due time. It certainly
is a wild night, Anne-a typical Christ
mas eve. Where are the youngsters?"
"Gone to bed like lambs," said their
mother In a burst of admiration. "I
haven't told them just what their
Christmas presents were to be, but
they are clever enough to guess, I sup
pose. I told them It was something
to wear."
"How about dinner tomorrow? Got
everything in that you need?"
"Everything," said Mrs. Tiddleberry.
bending a flushed fae over the evening
newspaper she had Just opened. "I
told you this morning it would b the
first Christmas eve you didn't have to
do any shopping. Did you miss it,
Henry ?'
"Did I?" exclaimed Mr. Tiddleberry
emphatically.
"So did I," admitted Anne soberly.
'Doesn't seem like Christmas at all. I
told the children to hang up their
ptockings."
"They might as well, I suppose."
said Mr. Tiddleberry. rather gloomily.
"If you hadn't forbidden me. Anne. I
might have managed a few orange or
something. I believe I'll go out and
get some now." lie reached into the
kitchen for his overcoat, but Anne
slipped to the china closet and threw
open the door.
"Wait. Henry! Look there!"

berry. and then he chuckled softly to
hiir.self. "Oh, Anne, Anne, bow could
you, when you forbade me to buy a
thing?"
"I baked a half dozen Christmas
plum puddings and sold them and
made enough to get some orauges and
nuts." blushed Mis. Tiddleberry under
bis tender scrutiny. "I couldn't bear
to have them find empty stockings."
"Is that till?" demanded her husband.
"Isn't it eu uch?" she evaded. "Come
in the parlor and look at the coat and
suit. I nvule a larger fire in the ft:r
urice and turned the heat in here so
it would 1 e warm when they got up in
the morninst.''
""h:it else have vou done. Anne?"
persisted Mr. Tiddleberry. "Confess!
I ll give you" looking, at his watch -'just
three minutes. Fire p head I''
Anne sank back in ' a big rocking
chair and closed heri eyes wearily.
"Well. I found one of I.innie's old dols
and made new clothes for it from head
to foot. It looks like new. Then I
made her three dainty handkerchiefs.
I had the material In the house. nnO
I fitted a little workbasket for her
That's all for Linnie. I made Bob a
bath robe."
"A bath robe! Out of what paper?"
"I had nn extra blanket, a 6mall one,
so I dyed it red and made a robe f r
him, using a curtain cord and tassels
dyed the same color. That's all except
the popcorn and candy. I never spent
n penny for anything except nuts and
oranges."
"It's enough, Anne Tiddleberry. and
you were the exponent of the giftloss
Christmas! Good night, my dear. Go
to bed. I shall sit up awhile."
"I'm afraid I've spoiled your Christ
mas by objecting to the presents." she
paid, with compunction in her totie, as
Khe lingered by his side.
"Xot at all. my dear. I wouldn't be
surprised if this turned out to be the
happiest Christmas we ever had."
Per a long while after his wife had
departed Mr. Tiddieberry waited in si
lence, and when he had quite deter
mined she must have retired ho tip
toed softly to and fro between the par
lor and the hall closet under the
stairs, bis stockinged feet making no
sound on the carpeted floor.
First he untied a package and look
ed with unstinted admiration upon a
cotton crape kimono in gay tints of
red and yellow, a pair of brown kid
gloves and a book that his wife ld
longed for. He found a pair of stock
ings in her darning basket and hung
one beside I.innie's. putting nuts and
candy and a big orange in first. Then
he stuffed in the kimono and the
gloves and laid the book on the shelf
above it.
Into Linnie's well filled stocking he
dropped a tissue paper package con
taining a silver bracelet, atid into
Bob's there went a pair of skates.
After he had solemnly executed a
highland fling on the hearth rug Mr.
Tiddleberry extinguished the lights
and went to bed much pleased with
his own shrewdness.
Pater Mrs. TMdleborry arose from
beside her sleeping husband and crept
down in the darkness to h:mg one of
his socks beside Bob's. She heard him
stirring and flitted back again with
out noticing any additions tu the row
of 6tockings on the shelf.
Just before daybreak Bob's door
opened softly, and a ghastly figure
made a journey down to the parlor
and returned. It was not until the
cold Christmas sun was peeplag over
the rim of the world and gilding I.in
nte TIddleberry's bedroom wh.dow
that the little girl stirred from her
warm nest, and timidly slipped down
the stairs over the pricking carpet.
Just as she reached her bedroom
door her father's voice roared in mock
ferocity: "Merry Christmas! Who goes
there?"
"Me," cried Lfnnie. "Merry Christ
mas, everybody."
That was the signal fur all the Tld
dleberrys to arise, for it was a Christ
mas custom with them that they
should ail go downstairs together on
Christmas morning. Mr. Tiddleberry
looked very coino'iicA-nt and self satis-
fied as he hurried into his clothes.
His wife was beaming with some hid
den happiness, while Linnie and Bob
saT on tho top stair fully dressed and
giggling joyfully. ,
It was a solemnly happy procession
that wended Its way down tho stairs
th:;t morning. "I'emember. children."
said Mrs. Tiddleberry. "I told you not
to feel disappointed if Santa Claus did
not remember you very bountifully
this year. Perhaps he has forgotten
you entirely. We are all so happy."
she looked around at the little group,
"that it seems as though we had ev
ery gift that Christmas can bring,
health and one another and peace and
good will."'
"And lots of love," burst out Linnie.
"Aud the pleasure of working for
each other." added Mr. Tiddleberry em
phatically as be opened the parlor door.
"Whoop-pee!" shouted Bob. making
a dash for his plethoric stocking.
"Oh!" cried Liunie delightedly.
"Oh!" echoed her astonished mother
as she claimed her own stocking.
"Great smoke!" ejaculated Mr. Tid
dleberry. feeling of his own dependent
sock. "Whal's here. Anns? Wearing
out your ' etty -yes over a knitted
scarf for me? And what Is ibis and
this?" He held two objects to vi:v.
"I gnve you the knife, and I want a
penny so as not to cut friendship,"
shouted Bob from the folds of his bath
robe as he strapped on his skates, "and.
I gave mother the hairbrush, and I
made Linnie the doll house out of a
soap box and some wall paper."
"And I gave you the pipe, father,
and the perfume is for mother, and I
knitted the toboggan cap fcr Bob out
of my old sweater I unraveled it,"
cried Linnie breathlessly.
Mrs. Tiddleberry was crying softly
over the contents of her stocking. "I
thought I was the only one who could
sacrifice for the others," she said
shauiefacedly, but they ail fell upon
her with caresses.
Bob," said his father, "how did you
do it?"
"Sold my rabbits didu't want 'em
anyway," said Bob defiantly.
"I ran errands for Mrs. Mosher. and
altogether I earned 4o cents," declared
Linnie proudly.
"Anne, you made plum puddings,"
accueI her hu?bar.d.
"Yes, and there's one for dinner, with
other good things," she said happily.
"How about your. Henry? How could
you afford it? Does your delay in get
ting home nights account for i.?"'
Mr. Tiddleben y nodded. "Be n clerk
ing in a bookstore nights to earn those
things, p.-lly plan too. Guess I'll do
it every year."
"This is the best Christmas we ever
had." declared Bob enthusiastically m
he flung his arms about his mother's
neck.
"I guess It must be because we n?l
love each other so much." said I.lnnle
sagely. And that was really the se
cret of the whole affair.
