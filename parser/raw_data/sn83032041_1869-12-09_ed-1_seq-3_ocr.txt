wish hirn abundant success.
Henry II Carr, a young colored man who

Messrs. Augustine Fogle, Jrs. P. Murphy
and Louis Plack, of Altoona. three of the

their visit was of a business character, we
hope it proved advantageous.
The reported murder of a young man
named Cassiday by his father, somewhere in
the Broad Top region, is without foundation
in fact. Of like character, we doubt not. is
the reported murder of an infant by its moth

are enough real tragedies, Heaven knows,
without getting up bogus murders.
Our intelligent friend. Mr. J. C. Stineman,
manager of the South Fotk coal works, in
forms us that John llourke, a miner em

bad his.collar borre broken and was other

in the mine in which he was at work. His
Injuries are not considered dangerous.
We learn that a man named James Craig
ley, hind brakeman on the "xpiess freight
train east, was killed in the Pi. R. R. tun
nel, at Gallitzin, yesterday (Wednesday)
morning. We could ascertain no particu
lars, but the presumption is that he fell fiom
one of the cars and was run over by the bal
ance of the train and killed instantly.
Israel Keefer and a man named Ringler
were out deer huntir.g together in Brothers

when the former saw a movement in the

wounded man was still alive at last accounts.
Health and comfort both demaud the use

We learn from our friend Dr. Zaigler that
two little grandsons of Mr. Win. Myers, of
Philipsburg. Centre county, undertook to
take their first lesson in smoking in the
bay-mow of the old gentleman's stable, and
the result was that they set fire to the hay.
and the hay set fire to the stable, and be
fore the fl imes could be extinguished the
stable and, all it contained was destroyed.
I Other property in the vicinity was saved
was 6aved with difficulty.
Our young friend and subscriber, Geo. F.
Huff, Esq., of Greensburg, is strongly urged
by quite- a number of his party papers for
the position of State Treasurer. Mr. Huff
is a gentleman of undoubted canacltv and
unimpeachable integrity, but we fear those
qualifications would rather deter than aid I
his election. An honest and able financier
like Mr. Huff is badly needed to take care
of the public funds, but the radical mj rity
in the legislature cannot be influenced by
considerations of that character, and hence
George is not likely to "make the riffle."
A freight train ou the Penna. Rail Road,
of which our young friend Johu Doran, of
oummerhill township, was engineer, ran iu
to the ni'ul train at Minor station on Tues
day, owing to the fact that the latter train
was behind time and no signal was sent
hack, and the result was that a passenger
named Henry Mahon. of Newark. N. J..
was injured so badly thr.t he died the same
evening, a freight brakeman namad Benja
min Sanlsbnry. of Lwrenceville, was killed.
instantly, and eleven others (among them j
Mr. Doran. who was considerably hurt about
about the head, face and on his right hip.

Wioe Awake. In the matter of bu
smrs. we do not know a more energetic or
wide awake dealer anywhere thau Geo. Hunt
ley, of the ELen?burg stoe tinware and
house furnishing emporium. Anything new iu
his line he is always Hire to obtain without de
lay, and in his dealings he is always prompt,
liberal and re i tble. We ask our farmer IVie ids
and others to call and examine two very useful
articles which he advertises in our paper to
dv. Mr. Huntley deserves every man's cus
toui who needs article in his line, and there id
no one who does not need more or less of such
goods as he keep for sale and sells theap.
!TiJiKiNG It ettikes u that many
people and things in this o 11 are strikers.
Clocks s rike, pugnacious men strike, pretty
women strike (your fancy), workmen often
strike, and printers strike non-paying subscrt
bers from their lists. These stiikes are all
good, bad or inditTerent, but oce unadulterated
good ftrike is to striite a bee line for Shoe
maker Si Co. 's store, where you can strike up
an excellent bargait. in the purchase of any
kind of goods you may want to boy. whether
dry goods, groceries, furniture, notious, and
"sich like." So strike at once everybody.
SoMKTiiiNtJ Sweet. We have "some
thing sweet to tell you," aud it's not a secret
yon need keep, for the more folks you tell the.
more people there will be to come in for a share
of the sweetness.- What we want to tell you is
that Vrllie Barker has the purest, sweetest,
clearest, heaviest and most delicious syrup that
we ever spread on a buckwheat cake, and hot
cakes and ' lasses" is one of our weaknesses.
We recommend it to everybody who has a
' sweet tooth in his head." for it is certainly
the best syrup that has ever been old here.
Make a Note of This Our readers
have already been informed that Mr. Edward
Mills has established himself in the flour, feed
and produce business, but tbey may not know
that he can sell flour, meal, feed, or nnything
else he deals in, just as cheap by the quantity
as like articles can be bought from anv miller
in the country. Persons buying to sell again
cannot deal to better advantage with any man
than they can with Mr. Mills. Those who
want fliur and produce for home consumption
will fare equally well at bis establishment.
Immense Preparations Mr. Leopold
Myer. Opera House, Main street, Johnstown,
is making great preparations for the holidavs.
He has ordered spe.-ial geods for the occasion,
among which are dress goods, fancy goods.

Local C'orreMpuudeuce.
J0HS8TOWN. Dec 6, 18G9.
Dear Freernan The first local item we
have -this wetk is all the way from Alaska
Sergeaut Johu H. Lenhart, of the Regular
Army, arrived here a few days ago direct
from Alaska. He made the trio in about
ntteen nays, tie brought wttn him a copy
f the "Alaska Times."( weekly.) and "The
British Colonist," (daily.) published at Vats
Couver's Island, the latter paper is dated
Nov. 9, 1869. From both papers it would
appear that "Northwestward the star of em
pire takes its way." All the appliances of
civilization are found at those places, such
as circuses, tbeaties, billiard saloons, auc
tions, etc., etc. There was trouble between
negroes aud Danes at Sitka ; also between
ai -
negroes and Russians. In B itish Columbia
the Governor was about to seek refuge in
United States territory fsiuce done) Ser
geant Lenhart hriugs an honorable discharge
a sound body home with him, and his
numerous tnends were glad to see him once
gaiu.
We are going to have two more churches
huilt here soon. The United Presbyterians
anJ the Episcopalians (Established church)
each intend to put up a suitable place of
"""'(' " wiati tnem mucn success.
Indeed there is plenty of room for more good
people in our little town, notwithatondiug
ah the efforts made for reform.
The Assistant Fire Company intend to
have a bail ou the Hat day of March, 1870.
at:d they make the appointment in time, so
that no other person will get pus-essiun of
Union Half on that day.
It will soon be time f r people to slander
their neighbors again. If you have been
observant, you must have noticed that sl.ia
der is periodical, aud as there has been i
lence observed for a month or so, look out
tox a defamation befote the holidays.
R. Ntlse Taylor, painter, having a little
leizure time, has painted f-r himself another
gorgeous sign aud put it up iu front of his
establishment.
The weai her clerk hereabouts is greatly
puzz'ed." He doesn't exactly know what to
do. Not so iu California. Our correspond
ent writes, "Nov. 20. 18G9. Spring has
fairly set iu here. We have had two tint
raius which has started the grass to grow
and everything looks as bright and green as
they do in May iu the States." Just think
of tb.at, you Mountaineers who have to en
dure at lea.-t four months' hard fret zing yet!
Thj dwelling house of a Mr. Croyle, a!
Mill Creek, Yoder township, was burned
dowu one day last week. No personal prop
erty was saved except a few bedclothes. No
lives were lost, as the fire occurred in the
day tima, but considerable personal proper-
ty was destroyed.
Louis Luckhardt, E.-q., jeweller, has now
in his store ou Main strict a one thousand
dollar organ, ordered through him from au
eastern firm for the use of the German Lu
therian church. It is a fine sounding in
strument, quite large, but not inconveni. nt'y
so. We judge it is about ten feet broad and
teu feet high. It has sixteen stops and a
double octave tread e. It ha cn inm ense
volunu enough for the largest church iu
Cambria county, and we would like to see
one like it in every church iu town. It
makes much better music than the common
cabiuet organ.
Scarlst fever still prevails in anil around
our borough. Several deaths have occurred

It is said that Hie Cambria c unty Teach

Cariotmas at E'oensburg. It is hoptd that
every teacher who attends wilt have an es
say or something else prepared, so that when
the teach"is d meet something will be done.
I see by the newspapers that the Bible
in Schools" is still the suhjtct of discussiou
ail over the land. There uever was as good
a book, and there never was a book so much
abused. We look upon the Bible as a man
ual of spiritual instruction, to be icad and
studied iu private for individual benefit, as
a pocket medic.il companion would be c in
sulted for physical maladies, anil not a book
to be thrust iu and read everywhere. Let
our spiritual inttrpreters use it iu public.
if it must be s) used.
We have bten in many a city and town,
but we never saw such fancy numbering on
houses as in-Johnstown nch peculiar tas'es
aucu verdant displays of color, and such
enormous figures. The numbers are of all
sizes, but some are large enough for letter
ing on a steamboat, or on Jupit-i's moons.
Large figures on a small house are certainly
out of taste. But so it is. Iiou Roy.
N. B. J almost forgot to say that I was
made the recipient ot some choice wedding
cake and other confections, sent all the way
from Hanisburg. Dr. Ernst and Emma his
wife (formerly Emma Bryan) were the don
ors. Heaven bless them, for I like g'odies.
The Doctor is a Willmorian. So is Emma.
