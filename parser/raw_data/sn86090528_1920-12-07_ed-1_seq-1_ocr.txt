"Best Meeting" Ever, Says President
at Committeemen Session Last
Night as He Instructs
Workers
MEMBERSHIP CAMPAIGN IS
ON TOMORROW 10 O'CLOCK
53
Committees, 106 Men Scheduled
to Cover Town, Calling on
Business Interests to Join
Chamber Here
"The best Meeting of Chickasha
(business and professional men over
(held."
With those words, L. C. Hutson,
president of the Chickasha Chamber
of Commerce described the mieotln
of the Chamber of Commerce com
mitteemen Hield last night in tho city
hall, preparatory to the membership
drive 'which is scheduled to start to
morrow at 10 o'clock. Mr. Hutson
wont on to explain that in making
that statement, he took into cons'd
eration the cold, rainy weather that
kept many away froim the meeting.
There were 53 committees to be
represented at the meeting la.st
night, and a "count of nose3
Vealod. that there "were 45
re
nte l
present.
Short and Snappy.
The committee meeting was re
markable in more 'ways than one.
It differed from the usual run, of
Meetings. There was no dispensing
of that widely celebrated commodity,
known as "hot air." The committee
mien were there to receive their in
structions for the drive, and offi
cials of the chamber were ready to
give, and did give those instructions,
'having done which the meeting ad
journed. In his remarks, Mr. Hutson point
ed out that the plan 'for the solicit
dng committees assembled was t
'send out 106 of tho leading business
and 'professional toon of Chickasha
to get mem.beris for toe Chamber of
Commerce and he referred to tha
fact that never before in the history
of Chickasha had there been so con
certed a movement toward one end.
Instructions Were Given.
To each committee was given a
ipad of pledge iblanks, an Individual
membership card, a display member
ship card and a list of firms or indi
viduals upon t "ioni the committee
was to call. Because there were so
many committees appointed, no list
to be called upon was large and it
was expected that the work, starting
tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock
would 'be finished iby noon.
The soliciting committeemen were
instructed to take the 'pledges from
the various firniis and individuals
listed by tihe finance committee of
the chamber, In the amounts set op
posite their names. It Was suggested,
however, that upon investigation if
the committeemen found that these
amounts were too large or too small,
a fair adjustment ;be made. If the
individual or firm manager protested
against the amount, and in the Judg
ment of the committeemen, his pro
test was unjust, in other words If ho
should pay the amount as indicated
by the finance committee, and tie
refused to pay the amount, tho com
mitteemen were instructed not to
take his pledge and chock in any
amount, but to report the conditions
as found, to the finance committee
who would then take further action.
Individuals May Join.
It was stated iby the president,
that in working out the lists given,
if the committeemen found that
anyone had been overlooked thev
should be given an opportunity to
join the Chamber of Commerce. In
the events the clerks or employes of
any firm desired to Join' the cham
ber, they should toe given the oppor-
tunity at a figure that they deemed
just. In fact, It was suggested that
they be incouraged In this movement
- though not pressed.
"The finance committee cannot
get the name of every firm, and In
dividual in the city" said Mr. Hut
son. "For this reason, it Is entirely
probable that some will be missed in
.the lists that will be circulated to
morrow morning. If any firm or in
dividual is not called upon, please
do not construe It as meaning th.it

ELKS FUNDS FOR
CHRISTMAS TREE
GETS BIG BOOST
Wife of Member Sends in $25; More
Cash Needed; People Asked to
Send Names of Needy
Children
"There's nothing so sweet as a
child's happiness. For this reason I
am enclosing nny personal check for
$25 for tho Elks' Christmas tree
fund."
This was the note, received iby of
ficers of the Chickasha B. P. O.
Elks from Mrs. J. C. Rickerts, to
gether with the check for $25, to
swell the fund with which the Elks
plan to give a Christmas tree to the
children of the city, wlho were it not
for a movement bf this sort, would
doubtless pass Christmas by with
out any of the cheer that accom
panies the season.
Tho fund is steadily growing, of
fleers of the lodge state, but ther-j
is yet a considerable amount of
money noeded to insure the success
of the undertaking. 'Members arc
being urged to send in their checks
to the secretary for this fund.
Names are1 Needed.
The general committee, of which
W. S. Riclhards is chairman, held! a
meeting in tho Elks club rooms
yesterday afternoon and made plans
for the gathering of the names of
the children who are to be invited to
the Christmas tree. An effort Is
being made today to secure tin
names of. every child in Chickasha,
whose circumstances are such that
otherwise the Christmas would mean
nothing.
It is pointed out that t'.ie affair is
an annual event and that in the
past scores of youngsters have been
made happy through the work of
the Elks in giving them a Christ
mas tree and program. It Is ex
peeted that the list this year 'will
be hardly as large as it was last
year, but dt is the desire that every
needy child 'be given an invitation.
Anyone who can secure the name
of such a child, is asked to turn
that name, together with the age,
address and sex of the child over to
the 'Daly Express, where the list
will be compiled, checked over, and
from, which list tho invitations will
be issued.
The purchasing committee desires
to buy the toys, articles of clothing
and treat for tho youngsters, 'before
the Christmas rus:i starts. It Is
shown to be necessary that the pur
chasing coonimitt.ee have the com
plete list, showing the name, age,
and sex of the children in order to
purchase tho articles intelligently.
The address of the children are nec
essary in order that the invitations
miay be delivered to the proper par
ties, it ds shown.

2750 Feet Deep; Drilling Com.
pany Has 28 Strings of
Tools In Artijii
That southern Grady county is at
tracting operators who can be
classed among the "big iboys" of tho
Industry, is evidenced by the spud
ding in of a test on the Goorgo
Hill farm in the center of tho
southwest of the southwest, of sec
tlon JMn-Tw, iby the Gladys Belle
Oil and Gas company of Tulsa, which
location is three miles norti of the
town Of Rush Springs.
The Glady3 Belle con ; any i j said
to be among the most exUisive
operators in Oklahoma, having, it is
understood 28 strings of tools carry
lng on oneof tha big drilling canv
paigns of the year in both proven
and wildcat territory. In what might
be called the immediate territory of
the Grady county test, the Gladys
Belle is drilling at anirjd 1,500 fee',
on a test in north S aliens county,
being in 'section ll-2ii-8w.
Grady Test Important.
The Grady test, on (he Hill farm,
is due to draw a gnat deal of at
tention 'fro mi the oil men, owing to
its location. Running fromi the Co
ment field to the Ile.aldton field,
from, ti'.m northwest to tho south
east and crossing Grady county in
that direction is a big anticline, con
necting in an almost unbroken chain
the Healdton and Cement fields.
Starting southeast from the heart
of the Cement field and about two
miles distant, is the Gorton well on
the Wagner farm., It is a good pro
ducer. Further and in Grady county
on a direct line, is the Shook wel',
drilled by the Knox Petroleum, com
pany in tho southwest of tho south
west of section l"Tn-8w. Continuing
southeast, along the crest of this di
vide is located the test of the Gladys
Bolle on the Hill fariiu ' With thy
Shook well producing, the Gladys
Belle test is to further prove, one
way or the other the productiveness
of the Cement'Hcalilton ridge.
A Combination Test.
A regulation 112 foot derrick has
been erected and the well was spud
ded with rotary tools. The plan is
to continue with t.he.'.e tools to a
depth of 2,000, unless a sand worthy
of a thorough test is picked up at a
lesser depth. It is understood, that
regardless of formal ions, standard
tools are to bo put In at a depth
of 2,000 feet and (lie contract fin-
iffted, 1,750 feet, with standard tools.
It is understood that all arrange
ments for an abundant supply of
water and fuel have been made, and
it is expected that, barring accidents,
this test will be completed rapidly.
On good authority it is stated that
the contract holders are protected
by a substantial 'amount of forfeit
money placed in a Rush Springs
bank, that the test will bo drilled
to the required depth, unless a pay
sand is picked up at a lesser level.
Ends Long Negotiations.
The spudding in of t"ie Gladys
Belle test, 'brings to an end a series
of negotiations extending over a
period of nearly a year.
A. B. Cook, a lease man of Mario v
worked for months among the prop
erty owners and having 'blocked thrt
required acreage, consummated a
deal with -the Gladys Belle to drill
the test, which drilling is now under
way.

POPCORN IS ONE
Declares Has $13,000 Worth of Corn

Wait for Advance
Does it pay to raise popcorn?
R. A. Lylo, one of Grady county s
leaning Dreeclor or fine hogs says
.

prove it. While Mr. Lyle's time is
devoted almost entirely to tho rais
ing of hogs, he snatches an oppor
tunity now and then to direct opera
tions on his farm', near Halco, 12
miles southeast of here, in the cul
ture of other growing things t'.ian
hogs.
'Last spring Mr. Lylo caused to be
planted 100 acres in popcorn. Ho
ban just finished gathering his crop
and according to his figures at the i
market price of pop-corn has $ 1 3,000 I
worth of thi3 product in his granar
ies. Mr. Lyle states that he has about
2,000 bushels of pop-corn, which is
an average of 20 bushels per acre
for his crop of 100 acres. T'.iis is
worth, he states, 10 cents per
pound or about $l!.r0 per bushel,
which would figure that his 2,0ti0
bushels would bring $13,000.
"I am not going to sell my corn
now" said Mr. Lyle. "I can get 10
cents a pound for it at. present, but,
I'm going to hold it until next spring.
I believe the price will be 15 cents' or
het'er then. There iB little or no
more work to raising a crop of pop
corn than the ordinary field corn, it
is more profitable? Well, I h'ive
found it that way this year for I
have never cashed in $13,000 off 10rJ
acres of field corn in my life."

was sent to the two houses by a
White Houso messenger, said that
there are two ways in which tho
United States can lead in establish
ing tho doctrine that "right makes
right" in the world.
Point Out Ways.
Tho ways as pointed out In fc'a.i
.message are: "By offering an ex
amplo within her own borders o'"
the will and power of democracy to
make and enforce the laws which
ore unqtieostionably just and which
equal their administration," and by
"standing for right and justice to
ward the individual nations.
The message declared Unit "a dis
play of an immediate disposition on
the part of congress to remedy any
injustices or evils that may havj
shown themesolves In our own
national life would afford a most ef
fectual off-set to the forces of cliao:.

Wilson's last regular nie '.sage was
scheduled to go to congress today.
It was regarded as virtually certain
that the message was to bo carried

White House messenger and read. (
by the clerk.
Although (he callers at the White
House were given the Impression
that President Wilson had not given
up the idea of addressing tho joint
session of Iho two housivt in person,
it was believed that he could be
prevailed upon not to do so, becnu.-o
of the danger to his health.
In case the president, does not ap
pear in person, the message will be
ead in each house separately by tho
clerks of the respective branche:;.
