at Home Yesterday.
KANSAS MUST NOT FAIL NOW
It Would Be a Black Eye to
Reputation of State.
Many Churches Were Aban
doned Over State Sunday.
Kansas churches failed to get be
hind the army Sunday when their col
lecticns (or the Bible and Testament
fund fell far below the state's quota
of a mere J7.6qO. A blizzard which
hit Kansas church goers from Rose
dale to St. Francis and from Syracuse
to Galena, kept thousands of men,
--omin and children away from Sun-
T day services. In many churches Bible
fund collections were not taKen.
Score of churches affected by Sun
day's storm are prepnrinsr to conclude
their campaign next Sunday.
The real importance of a failure in
the Hible ami New Testament drive
in today being driven home to min
isters and church workers in all sec
tions of Kansas. , They realize that
failure means a black eye to the
rhurth and to the hich moral and re-
li.imia standard which Kansas has

tiiat organizations such as the liquor
dealers association -will tell the worm
that Kansas and her prohibition do
not mean a real, genuine, right from
the heart conviction. Then they will
sroff and tell the wet states that

Tiiat is the danger to Kansas in

"Of course it was a severe day and

THEY MISSED MANY
At That, Citiwns' Committee Gath
ered 10.000 Books. 10 Tons Magazines.
In nearly very street in Topeka the
bugles sounded Sunday afternoon an
nouncing the arrival of the collectors
of books and magazines for the sol
diers. More than ten tons of maga
zines and probably 10.000 volumes of
books were taken to the state library
by red nosed frozen faced heroes who
braved the zero weather to furnish
the soldiers with reading matter for
the winter yet to come. Forty auto
mobiles and practically 100 volunteer
workers braved the terrors of frozen
radiators and frost bitten noses in
carrying the books from the various
houses to the west wing of the state
house. '
Every class and kind and degree of
literature can be found in the great
pile which sadly interferes with traf
fic in the west hall of the state house.
Magazines of every description -and
nearly every name ranging from Jim
Jam Jems to the highest grade of ed
ucational pamphlets, story magazines
and technical, and magazines that are
a potpourri of subjects can be iden
tified. The books range from the best
sellers with their backs hardly broken
down thru the range of older novels
now somewhat out of date but well
preserved to the old battered, time
worn volume the friend and solace of
en entire generation. Books for chil
dren, about society, the eternal trian
gle, and books about Just men are
among the volumes collected.
The books and magazines will be
sent to h oanips as aoen as they can
be backed in boxes, according to a
statement by George Godfrey Moore,
chairman of the drive. Moore fur
ther stated that a great number of
houses were missed in the collection
and he requests that any one whose
magazines and books were not col
lected bring tfum to the Kansas state
library commission rooms in the state
house at once so that they can be in
cluded in the shipment.
KANSAS LEADS ALL
Jflnety-fonr Per Cent of Families En
rolled in Food Pledge.
Manhattan, Kan., Dec. 10. With 94
per cent of the families in the state
enrolled. Kansas stands at the head
of all the states of the Union in
signed pledges for conservation of
food in accordance with the plans of
the United States food administration.
The total number of signatures in
Kansas reported to Dr. H. J. Waters,
food administrator for the state, is
464,277. This is one and a half times
the goal set In the campaign, which
was only 300,000. ,
The percentage of families enrolled
in the state is Just double the percent
age the United States over, which is
4 7. Next to Kansas stands Iowa, with
91 per cent. These are the onlv two
states running 90 or over. Returns
from states surrounding Kansas range
from 56 to 70 per cent.
The high attainment in the Kansas
campaign is attributed to the thoro
organization maintained and to the
whole-hearted zeal and -n.r,nr-ann
of workers in all parts of the stafe?
n wen as to me general patriotic sen
timent of the public.

BUT PIES ARE SAFE!
Apple Pie Appetites of Sammies In
vited Air Raid; Three Injured.
BY J. W. PEGLKR.
American Field Headquarters, Dec
10. A certain mess sergeant's apple
pie cookery was probably responsible
indirectly for injury of three American
soldiers by a German aeroplane bomb.
The three were members of army
"specialty troops." They were natives
of Buffalo, N. y. Hannibal, Mo., and
Detroit, Mich.
The boche air attack occurred on a
recent star-lit evening. Enemy air
planes dropped two bombs cm a town
outside the American army area,-4ut
in which there were a handful of
American specialty troops temporarily
performing detached service.
One Bomb Didn't Explode.
One of the German bombs struck
the building1 in which the Americans
were bil leted. A mess sergeant of
Seattle, Wash., to4ay said he thought
he knew how the boches got their aim.
"I was cooking apple pies," he ex
plained, "and I think the light from
my cook- stove, shining thru the ven
tilator roof, must have guided the
enemy. Bombs dropped near the
kitchen and shook up the stove but
they didn't damage my pies."
A third bomb dropped as the enemy
sped away into the night struck a hay
stack on the edge of the village, rolled
off and landed plump between the legs
of an American soldier who had taken
refuge at the base of the haystack.
Miraculously the bomb failed to ex
plode. EAGERLY READ BY JAPS
Particularly Interested In Wilson's
Outline of IT. S. War Aims.
Tokio, Dec. 10. President Wilson's
message to congress was published by
morning and afternoon newspapers
thruout Japan. It received unusual
editorial opinion, especial stress being
laid on the advantage of a complete
exposition of the principles and ob
jects for which the United States en
tered and is prosecuting the war.
The widespread publicity siven the
message in Japan constituted a record
and it 4e believed that the message
will impress effectively the Japanese
public as to the sentiment prevail
ing in America.

IN THE BALANCE
Fate of Many Leagues To Be
Decided This Week.
Tener and Herrmann Are In a
Big Row.
New York, Dec. 10. Today opena
a critical week in the existence of
baseball.
War time economies are expected
to be announced following meetings
of the International and Western
leagues today, the National league to
morrow and the American league the
day following.
The gloomy, ashen, hue of the Inter
national league's chances for survival
have changed to something that looks
a little more rosy. Intimations that
the league may decide to continue as
a six-club circuit until after the war
have been heard and probably bear
some basis of facts. However, the
International league struggles along
thru the bare courage and stoutness
of heart "of Ed Barrow. That unre
lenting nicks are certain to oe niaue
in expenses befote the six-club own
ers will agree to take another chance.
The Western league is certain to
start, it seems.
More trouble loomed ahead today
as National leaguers prepared for
their annual gabfest. President John
K. Tener and Garry Herrmann are
reaching a sword's point state in their
relations as a result of Herrmann's in
sistence upon a joint meeting of Na
tional and American league magnates,
regardless of President Tener s- feel
ings in the matter. There were ru
mors that Tener might not agree to
the selection of Herrmann again as
chairman of the National commission
and there were hints that Herrmann
might insist on a cut in Tener's sal
ary as one of the first of war time
economies.

STARS IN FIELD
That's One Reason Giants Won
National Pennant.
They Led League in Team
Fielding, Averages Show.
BY JACK VEIOCK.
New York, Dec. 10. Good fielding
played no small part in the winning
drive of the New Tork Giants this
year. The official.. National league
fielding averages, made public today,
show the Giants out in front of the
league In team fielding with a, per
centage of .868, and the records of
Secretary John F. Heydler show that
McGraw"s team played nearly a third
of its games without an error, turning
in a total of forty-five errorless con
tests. Such fielding was without a
doubt a big aid to the pitchers.
The Phillies and Cardinals finished
second and third In fielding, with the
Boston Braves ranking fourth, r red
Mitchell's Cubs trailed their league
in the acceptance of chances.
McGraw's catchers Dlaved a great
fielding game behind the bat. Bill
T'.ariden, who caught 100 games for
the champions, had but five passed
balls all season, while Lew Mccarty
had one and George Gibson one.
Miller Star Fielder. .
In individual fielding. Jack "Dots"
Miller, of the Cards, led all other
Dlavers. He finished the season with
a fielding average of .998.
Johnnv Rawlings, a new member ot
the Boston Braves, heads the second
basemen with 467 accepted chances
out of 478 offered in ninety-six games.
Hoinie Groh, of the Reds, was the
best fielding third baseman in the
National last summer. He Dlaved every
championship game at third and
finished with an average of .966, mak
ing only eighteen boots out of more
than 500 chances at the hot corner.
Heinle Zim, of the champions, col
lected an average of .94 7 in 149 games.
Johnny Rawlins bobs up again as
a leader in the figures showing the
work of the shortstops. Artie Flet
cher, of the Giants, is the real leader.
however, and Walter Moranville runs
him a close second. Fletcher's aver
age shows .956 in 151 games.
Dode Paakert, of the Phillies, is
entitled to the leadership among the
outfielders. Dode played in 138. games
and finished the season fielding .984.
Carey, of the Pirates; Neale, of the
Reds, and Kauf, of the Giants, were
among the league's surest fielders.
Demarec Star Fielder.
Rixey. of the Phillies, and Demaree.
of the Giants, are tied for fielding
honors among the pitchers. Each
played in thirty-nine games and went
through without an error. .
Old Honus Wagner, the frranddaddv
of all the National leaguers, -played
over fifty games. In forty-seven games
at first base he took 455 out of 462
chances and in eighteen games at
third base he made but three mis
plays. The distinction of being rated in
four different positions goes to Harry
Myers, of the Dodgers, who played
the outfield and first, second and third
base. Rollie Zelder broke into the
averages at second, third and short,
and Fitzpatrick, of the Braves, ap
pears among the outfielders and the
second and third basement.
TO PLAY 120 GAMES
Western Iaeue Will Have Eiht
Clubs In Race Dickerson Say.
St. Joseph, Mo., Dec. 10. Peoria
and BloominKton, 111., are the two
cities most favorably regarded as new
members of the Western league, it
was said by E. W. pickerson, president
of the league. Oklahoma City and
Tulsa, two southern cities, have been
mentioned, but President Dickerson
said that a majority of the. club own
ers do not believe it wise to extend the
circuit in that direction.
Every club owner except Jones of
Denver attended the meeting of the
league which opened Sunday, and the
proxy of Jones is held by E. J. Han
Ion of Sioux City.
President Dickerson announced that
the season would start May 1 with a
120-game schedule, and that the sea
son would not be divided. Only three
cities now holding franchises are cer
tain of having teams in the league
next season, Dickerson declared.
These cities he named were Omaha.
Des Moines and St. Joseph. The final
makeup of the league will be de
termined before, the present meeting
here ends, however, he said. He said
there was no doubt but that the league
would open the 1913 season with
eight clubs.
