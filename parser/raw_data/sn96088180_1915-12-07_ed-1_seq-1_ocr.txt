WILSOtl AtlD SEE
Washington, Dec. 7. -President
Woodrow Wilson today made his
tenth appearance before a joint ses
sion ot the . house and senate.
Tho lure ot seeing him and ot get
ting a glimpse of his fiancee In the
presidential gallery; the desire to
hear his views urged on one of the
most momentous congresses In the
nation's history, drew great crowds.
From early morning on they came.
Hundreds were, turned aside In dis
appointment, however, for only 565
admissions were issued, and all ot
them were used. v -'
The diplomatic, and executive gal
leries were filled. Seata reserved tor
fortunate ticket holders among the
general public were filled long toefoae
the president entered the hall of the
lower house.
r
Early Comers Bring Lunches
Some of the early comers brought
tholr lunches, prepared to camp out
all day; doorkeepers shattered their
plans, however, refusing them admit
tance until they had laid aside or
eaten the lunches. The usual group
of old ladles,- with their knitting.
too, were on hand.
(Before the president's arrival the
floor and gallery bussed with con
versation. '' 1 .
When the president, escorted by
delegates from thtvsenate and house
entered the chamber, a mighty roar
of applause burst forth,' and then the

HIS FUTUnE WIFE
His prayer was that congress might
receive the president's message and
"act clamly, discreetly, and wisely
and thuB serve the people's Inter
ests." ' .
Mrs. Gait in Evidence
For those to whom tho opening
message ot the 64th congress meant
only a spectacle, the center of attrac
tion was Mrs, Norman Gait, the pre
sident's fiancee. Smiling, handsome,
dressed in a dark blue broadcloth
suit adorned with a .bouquet of rare
orchids, and wearing a dark hat, she
made her way into the executive bal
cony shortly after noon. With her
were Miss Margaret Wilson, Mies
Helen Woodrow Bones, Mrs. McAdoo
and Mrs. Boiling. .
As the president- delivered his
scathing denunciation ot hyphenated
Americans, the dlplomatlo galleries
listened intently. No Teutonlo diplo
matic representative was present. But
the ambassadors of Great Britain,
Japan, Russia and Argentine were on
hand, with the ministers of Persia,
Panama, Salvador and Sweden, minor
attaches and women members of the
corps. Some of them were glad to
find places lq the aisles.
Surrounded by secret service men
and police, the president reached the
capltol at 12:20. Capitol guards and
city police kept the crowds away
from his car, and cleared a path to
a private elevator. From there he
was, takenv to the second floor of the

If DEMOCRATS
Washington, Dec, 7. St. Louis
seemed to tie ahead by at least a nose
in the race for democratic convention
city, when the democratic national
committee got down to buslnesa to
day. Dallas was still fighting; Chi
cago campaigners kept more or less
in the dark; and only little was
heard from , San Francisco boosters.
All delegation!, nevertheless, were
rooting hard though quietly. June
12 or 19 seemed the likely date for
the convention.
.. That the committee will decide on
renomlnatlon of President Wilson by
acclamation was unquestioned. The
opposition to Vice-President Marshall
as bis binning mate, however, seem
ed crystallized into a definite plan.
Hearings for suffrage and.' anti
suffrage delegations, contesting dele
gations for conrentlqn city, and oth
ers promised to delay the balloting
for tho city.
Will R. King was seated today as
Oregon's' delegate to the national
committee, though indications dur
ing'the forenoon pointed to selection
of H. M. Easterly.
The rules committee favored King
on the understanding tnat easterly
would succeed him after the conven
tion. " The committee also held that
the rule adopted at Baltimore for the
primary election of committeemen ap
plied only to successors ot the pres
ent members.

San Francisco, Dec. 7. The gov

Bopp is frankly disgusted with the
whole affair. His withdrawal from
service, be intimated today, would
come as a welcome relief from
charges and Innuendoes against him
