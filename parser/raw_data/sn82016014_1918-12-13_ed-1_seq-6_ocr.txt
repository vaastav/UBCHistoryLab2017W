115 West 6th St.'
A line of mighty oak trees along
each side of the great concrete high
way that is to be built from Fort
Leavenworth to Fort Riley, in honor
of our victorious soldiers, sailors and
marines, is the ambition of the com
missioners of Shawnee county. The
commissioners believe that these "vic
tory oaks'' would be appropriate as
living monuments to the heroes of the
world war and in time would become
more inspiring than any monument of
bronze or marble.
A resolution has been drawn up to
this effect, to be presented to Senator
"W. F. Henoch. Representatives Matt
Weight man, W. M. Amos and L. H.
Xeiswender, and the Topeka Chamber

RUSSIA NOT U. S.
New York, Dec. 13. New Yorkers
today were confronted by a "proclam
ation" issued by the "loyal Bolshe
viki" cancelling all debts, abolishing
rent, repealing all laws, declaring pub
lic offices vacant, dissolving the army
and navy, emptying all jails, taking
over all industries on behalf of the
workers and stipulating that the flag
hereafter shall be plain red.
Ellis O. Jones, a humorist, who is
chairman of the people's day com
mittee, wrote the "proclamation." He
added that these revolutionary
changes were effective at 12 noon to
day, and that the radicals would par
ade in Central Park, in defiance of the
police in celebration thereof.
The Socialist party issued a state
ment declaring it had nHthing what
ever to do with Bolsheviki arrange
ments. An extra force of police will
be on hand at the park to preserve
order.
STOREHOUSE TO FRONT
Once More I-oyal Sauta Fc Employes
81 low True Colors.
The Red Cross campaign commit
tee's appeal to the merchants and
business men of Topeka to back the
Christmas Roll Call campaign thru the
purchase of display advertising bore
fruit in unexpected quarters. The em
ployes of the Santa Fe storehouse
read the appeal, decided that the job
of putting over the campaign meant
as much to them as it does to the
merchants, and proceeded to sub
scribe a sufficient fund to buy two
full pages of newspaper advertising.
One page appears in the State Jour
nal today.
More than that, too, the employes
of the storehouse also raised a snug
sum to be used in buying Red Cross
memberships for those persons in To
peka who will be unable to pay for
their own.
This subscription to the advertising
fund for the Red Cross Christmas Roll
Call campaign is characteristic of the
attitude the employes of the store
house have shown in the various war
campaigns in Topeka.

TAKE BACK THE PLAYERS
Faint and Putty Ijcaguers Back Into
Baseball Again.
Chicago. Dec. 13. If Paint and Put
ly league players are good enough to
get by with the fans, they will be tak
en back into the American league.
This action is left to individual leagues
according to action at the ieague meet
ing here Thursday.
A sentiment of standpatism prevail
ed at the meeting. Present rulers will

resolution of confidence voted Chair
man Garry Herrmann of the national
commission.
The junior league owners went on
record as favoring the 140 game
schedule as against 154 games. Action
by the national league must be await

IS A GOOD ONE
TO PREVENT WAR

sistant secretary of state for foreign
affairs, announced today that he has
worked out a scheme which will "pre
vent future wars.".

not think nations will make war when
the populations understand what is
just and fair."

WOODEN SHIP"DObMED
Shipping: Board's Decision To Let
Down Contracts Comes.
Washington, Dec 13. The" wooden
ship is doomed.
This is the result of the United
States shipping board's decision to let
down as far as possible on that type
of construction. It was announced to
day that it would discontinue work on
a considerable number of such vessels
in the early stages of building and
cancel contracts for vessels of this type
not yet under construction.
Sixty vessels, were at once desig
nated for stoppage of construction,
but the number will run much higher
when a survey has been completed.
The board's policy is to finish a
ship in case its construction is so far
along as to involve too heavy a liv.s
in indemnification of the contractor.
The board made commitments for
731 wooden ships far in excess of
normal trade needs, it is stated. Be
cause the emergency is passed, the
board has decided to start its aban
donment work at once.
