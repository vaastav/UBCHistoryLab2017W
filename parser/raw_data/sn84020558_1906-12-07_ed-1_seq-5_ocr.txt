connected with the sheriffs office.
Keturning to his desk he began open
jr:g ti e morning mail and was thus
encased when the sheriff entered.
"Ah. pood-morning, sheriff," he said
; that gentleman entered.
" Cood morning, prosecutor," was the
pleasant response. "Beautiful morn
ing." "Beautiful, indeed. In fact too beau
tiful to impart the unpleasant infor
mation which I am about to disclose."
"So?" said the she: iff dejectedly.
"Yes. The grand Jury have request
ed me to prepare a warrant for the ar
nst of Terrible Ike."
"Well, well, well; this is indeed un
1 1 asant news. What are the charges?"
"There is the warrant, you can see
f-r yourself." and he handed the docu
ii. - nt to the sheriff.
The sheriff perused it and as he fin
islitd. lifted his eyebrows, whistled
s -ftiy and turned his eyes in the direc
ii"n of the prosecutor with an enquir-ir-g
gaze.
"I regret," said the prosecutor, "that
'i:t duty com pells us to participate in
li is unpleasant affair, and I trust that
w shall occasion Ike but little incon
venience in regard to the matter. How-
ver, it will be necessarv fr.r vnn tn
He had a lone- mustache
which swayed gently to and fro In the
morning breeze and a six shooter hung
carelessly at his side.
I am looking for a gentleman by the
name of Ike," said the constable. "I
don't exactly know his full name, but
he seems to be an Individual of some
prominence in this locality and Is
sometimes referred to as Terrible Ike.
Could you inform me where I would be
likely to find him?"
"Wa-al, I reckon ye won't hev to go
very fur to find him," was the gruff
reply
"Ah! then you know him? If you
would be so kind as to inform me
where I shall find him I would greatly
appreciate your kindness."
"Wa-al stranger, I'm him."
To say that the constable was sur
prised would be putting it rather mild
ly. He was dumbfounded.
"Oh!" he exclaimed, "I had hardly
expected to encounter you so soon. I
have a document here which I was re
quested to rtad to you." saying which
he drew the warrant from h:s pocket
and began to read:

Accordingly he mounted his horse

Although the constable had often
heard of Terrible Ike, it had never been
his good foitune to meet him personal
ly and consequently his mission was
t 'it her an uncertain one. He had rid-l-n
some twelve or fourteen miles,
when he discovered In the distance, a

Ike listened intently and after the
constable had finished he remained
some moments in silence, meditating.
"Wa-al, stranger." he finally drawl

F. O.
Washington, D. C, December 2, (Spe
cial Correspondence to The Republi
can). One of the subjects of which
President Roosevelt will treat In his
message to congress will be the deplor-
aoie condition of our coast defenses.
Deplorable, not so much through the J
lack of fortifications, guns or mach- i
Inery, although much remains to be
done on all three, but especially be
cause of the lack of men necessary to
keep the guns and machinery in order
in times of peace, to say nothing of
maintaining them should war break
out. What the President will have to
say on this subject will be short but
to the point and he will take a firm
stand in favor of legislation calculated
to lemedy existing conditions. He has
already placed himself squarely on re
cord, and only six months ago addres
sed a special letter to the senate in
which he pointed out that the increas
ing Importance and wealth of our ports
offered more Inducement to an enemy.
"The fact that we now have a navy
does not In any wise diminish the Im -portance
of coast defense; on the con
trary. It emphasizes their value and the
necessity for their construction." he
said recently. "It is an accepted naval
maxim that a navy can be used t-i
strategic advantage only when acting
on the offensive, and it can be free to
so operate only ofter our coast de
fence Js reasonably secure and so rec
ognized by the country." ' J.
The President takes the ground that ' Q
"luniy mm piuiec.ion oi our in
terests require, the completion of our
coast defenses, and that the plans fur
the national coast defense board should
receive the generous support of con
gress. Ia his forthcoming message the Pres
ident will reaffirm his position, espe
cially so far as pending legislation pro
viding for the reorganization of the
coast artiltry is concerned. The sen
ate committee on military afTalrs ha?
favorably reported a bill to separate
tile field artillery from the coa.st artil
lery, on the ground that they are two
distinct branches of the service. The
bill provides for tho gradual increase
during five years of 296 o.Ticers and
5.043 men for the coast artillery and
h5S for the field artillery. The grea
trouble of the coa.st artillery has bee
to secure nnl keep trained electri
clans, engineers and firemen. It will
surprise many to know that most of
the cost of fortifications Is for elec-:
trleal machinery, "fire control," and
seisrch lights, the "fire cor.tiol" being j
the system of telegraphic and tele- t
phonic communication between forts
and batteries, and with observing sta
tions. Millions of dollars have been :
spent, and additional millions will be 1
Fpent to establish power plants and in- j
stall costly- electrical machinery, and
yet the coast artillery is expected to !
take care of them with enlisted men !
at $13, $15, and $18 a month. For ex
ample: Sixty engineers are absolutely
necessary, and the bill provides for.:
that number at $780 per annum each.
The places of these engineers are now i
filled by privates and non-commission- j
ed officers, the pay of the highest being '
$!S per month. As such engineers can j
get from $75 to $100 per month in pri
vate life It is almost Impossible to get I
them to ro-enlift after they once quali- !
fy as engineers, and thus the costly j
and Intricate machinery of our coast
defenses is almost constantly in the
hands of untried men. In addition, the j
work of constantly breaking in new;
men is extremely trying to the officers,
and discouraging to those who are at- i
templing to bring the coast artillery to
a high state of efficiency. !
A private statement of the condition ;
of the roast defenses of 2$ fortified
ports shows that to man them with one
shift of officers and men, that is to say,
each man at his proper station, would j
require 40.675 men, and 1.634 oilicers. i
There are today available at the dif- '
ferent forts 10.713 men and 3.17 o'fl- j
cers, scarcely enough to keep the guns ,
and machinery from rusting. j
Commercial Interests in gene:al. and j
especially those concerned with ship- j
ping and terminals at nur great ports, pi
will be Interested in this matter if they ! Mj
take the trouble to investigate ln'; Ij
facts. Take New York for Instance, 'jj
with Forts Tot ten. Schuyler. Slocuni. ; 1
adsworth. Hamilton anil Hancock, ;
equipped with ' big guns, torpedos,
sea?ch lights, etc. It would require 22i f
officers and 5.6C. men to man these
forts alone, without providing for any
relief whatever. That is more than
two-thirds of all the officers and half
of all the men now engaged In taking
care of all the coast defenses of the !
entire l-n'ted States.
Other cities present interesting sta
tistics. There is San Francisco, the
teiminal of the Harrinian and other
great transcontinental lines, and from
which the ships of the Pacific Mail and
other trans-Paclflc lines carry our
goods to the orient; In many respects
the key to Hawaii. Guam and the Phil
ippines. To defend San Francisco are
Forts Foster, MHey, Barry. Baker, Ma
son, Winfield Scott and McDowell. To
man these would require 175 officers
and 4.268 men. There are available 42
officers and 1.400 men. The coast de
fense plans call for the expenditure of
$3,119,242 to complete the defenses of
San Francisco, of which $439.6'iO is to
be spent for guns, emplacements and
carriages; $459,955 for submarine mine
lefenses; $334,952 for a central power
plant; X193.064 for a reserve power
plant; $19R.OOO for search lights; $19.
600 for mixlernizing older emplace
ments, and $1.473.f)91 for "fire control."
It will cost $1,473,331 to install a com
plete system of communication alone
at San Francisco, and it is a significant
fact that this fire control installation
will be the only one resommended to
congress this year, because there are
no men available to care for others u
they should be installed. And, in pass
ing, it may be remarked that for Fo:t
Mason and Fort McDowell at San Fran
Cisco there are no men available at
all.
