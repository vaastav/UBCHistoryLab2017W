Dr. John Cook, of Steubenville, at
time a resident of this place, died
Thursday, at the residence of his
De Witt Danford, Esq.,BelI
aire. His funeral took place at Steu
benville, on Saturday. The Steul.en-
ville Gazette has the following in ref
erence to the dMttb:
The doctor was well known to many
our citizens, having practiced medi
in the village of Kichmoud from
about IS18 until 1857. Some seven or
eight years since ho removed to St,
Clairsville, where he resided throe or
years, when he left there and came
this city. He has been in p-.tor
neaitn ior several years, but on last
Saturday feeling better than he had for
long time, he went to Bellaire to nee
youngest daughter, Mrs. Danford,
where he was taken worse, and died
Thursday morning. The doctor whs
about 84 years of age. Dr. Cook was a
gentleman of far more than ordinary
intellect being one of the best inform
ed persons of our acquaintance. When
practiced medicine he was very
successful. He had the confidence and
esteem of ail who know him, and his
death will be deeply regretted by many
warm personal friends in the different
places where he has resided. He leaves
ife and several children to mourn
death.
By reference to ouradvertising col
umns it will be seen that the annual
election of Directors of the First Na
tional Bank of this place, occurs on the
of January. Apropos to this, itj
announced that theefficieutand geu-j
tlemanly Teller of the Bank, Mr. A.
Blair, owing to the inadequacy of
salary paid, will retire from that
position in February.
We speak advisedly, and reflect the
views of a large number of the heavi
est depositors and stockholders of the
Bank, when we say that the Board of
Directors will make a grave mistake to
dispense with the services of Mr. Blair,
rather than advance his salary, say a
couple of hundred dollars per year.
Blair has occupied his present po
sition for seven or eight years; lie is
thoroughly conversant with all thedu
ties of the Bank, and acquainted with
people with whom the most of the
business is transacted. His knowl
edge which he has gained by these sev
en years of experience in that institu
tion is worth incalculably more to the
stockholders, than is the paltry sum
required to retain his services.
We hope that the Directors at their
meeting will take such steps as
secure the retention of Mr. B., to
continue as lieutenant to the able Cash
ier, Mr. H. C. Welday, and thus in
sure the continued popularity and
prosperity of the First National.
