Pesidnt Grant's Ulessaga.
Congress convened on Mondav the 7''
inst., and tlje President's Message was read
(Mi that day. IJelow we uivc a synopsis of
the Message, which, we presume, will be
sufficient t give our readers an idf-n of th j
icws of the Pr'Muni, 11k document
doe not amount to much in any particular:
The I'n-iHfit ays in his message tltAt
pur relations with all lon-ijrii- powers are
Irieiidjy ami without disturbance, though
there is an uiisUhd question with Vene
zuela, which has not yet paid the awards of
the Joint Commission under the Convention
of 1866. Congress, it will be recollected,
strongly .etfpfeeed its sense on this subject
in Fcbr,uy, 1873. The President, in his
messe joflast December, paid there was
reason to believe lite hesitancy of that Re
public in recognizing the claim sprung, in
part at least, from real difficulty in dis
charging them in connection with its obli
gation to other government; and, there
for?, l&e .expediency of further forbearance
on Xka jwj't joI our government wan believed
to Le .worthy of the consideration of Con
gress. Jji addition to Venezuela, we have
unset t,Ud .questions with Spain, growing
.out of the affair of the Virginitis and other
grievous transactions on the part of the
Spanish 4Uitlifrilifs in Cuba. The magni
tude of tliH offriisi-s has not been reduced
ince the President's previous message, a
year ago. As this unsettled condition of
jifFaiysu Cuba cannot long continue,it may
become necessary for other nations, with
jour own, to interfere to terminate the insur
rection which has so long prevailed, the
Spanish Government having unsuccessfully
attempted to suppress it. In the meantime
the commerce of all count ries, ami especially
that of the Un'tfed States, suffers, the flags
ii the U,nited Stales and England having
been ins.ulttd. The President, in conversa
tion, although he does not state the lact in
his message, says the United States purchase
about eighty per cent of the Cuban exports
and, therefore, t he duties paid by American
citizens contribute to this extent in helping
Spain to continue the war against the in
surgents. The President had hoped that
by Umj ;meeting of Congress the present ne
gotiations with Spain would have been
AVideL; but in this ease he has been disap
pointed. He, therefore, says little about
indemnity, pending the negotiations, but
At some future time will present the subject
(to the special consideration of Congress.
Tlo position of the President on the finan
cial question is positively as follows, nor
witlcstanding the former speculation of
those who spoke without authority: He
desires and recommends ihe resumption of
specie payments at the earliest practicable
.day, but he does not believe this can be
ireached as soon as the first of January, 1870.
He does not name anv dav, leaving Congress
to devise means to secure this desired end,
it being the duty of Congress to do so.
The legal tender clause of the currency act
should be repealed to take effect as to con
tacts made after the day lobe fixed by
iaw for its repeal. Power should be given
to the Secretary of the Treasury to obtain
gold, foam and after the date fixed for the
fcsiuuptinn of specie payment, by the issue
M bonds. In addition to this the revenues
,of the government should be in excess of
the .ex-pendit uresto support the resumption :
gmaUr economy should be practiced in all
jdep&ftmcnts of the government, ami if nec
essary, the customs and internal revenue
law changed, in order to secure a larger amount of
revenue with the return of specie payments; bank
ing should bo fire, bill holders should continue to
e protected ns at pr.wnt under the hanking laws.
Ther jliovrid be no limitation to the volume ot
currency, nsthe community itself should determine
what. amount is required for business transactions
instead of leaving the Executive, Secretary of the
Treasury, and Congress to fix the limit. It would
be the.duty of Congress, however, to make regula
lions regarding free banks of Issue, and to state the
conditions on whioh they be organized and transact
business, ;thc legi-dation to be in accordance with
th' new order of things, or in other words, the
resumption of specie payments. There should be
no monopoly in fixing the amount of issue. The
President will recommend that Congress do not
interfere with the pre."nt currency act, passed dur
ing the last seFann, unless it be to amend it so as to
conform with a pi fin for the resumption of specie
payment. The President will make no recommen
dation on the subject of internal improvements by
the general government, but will men lv refer to
the fact that Congrts ha already appointed a
Committee on Transportation Routes to the Sen
board, which has already made it rport, nn I will
give further information on more recent investiga
tions. The President devotes much space to affairs in
Arkansas; giving reasons whv he declined to in
terfere in the recent dlftViltie in that State, and he
advert t the facts narrated in his special mtssarc
to Congress In February, 1873. relative to Louis
iana, in which he 'said he had no specific recom
mendation to mV;e in the s-iSpet, bit if there
Wts any practical way of renvr"ng these oMflvul
tirs by legislation, then he earnestly r quested that
the ymtjon might be taken up at that session of
Congress. He was'ext-emely anxious to avoid anv
pretence of undue inte ferenee in State affairs, and
if Congress differed with him as to what murht to
be .tloue, he requested its immediate decision to
.thatetfoot, otherwise he should feel obliged, n far
subu coiUd ibyjUve exercise of legitimate aut!iority.
puf au ,enJ to .the unhappy controversy which
'fatmbed Hie peace and prostrated the biislu-s? of
I Louisiana, by the recognition of that government,
which was recognized and upheld by the Courts of
the Sute. It seemed adrisable that he should st te
what CQUXie he should feel bound to pursue in re
ference to the matter in the event that no action
being taken ,on the sul ji c by Cmgress at that time,
nut subject to any satisfactory arrangements that
jfciahl be iuade by the parties to tlie eon t rovers v
nd which of all things was the most desirable. It
would be his duty, so far as it might lv ccary
fr.r him to act. to adhere to the goVernment hereto
fore recognized by him. The President again sub
mit the p. nation to Congress, and will continue to
act ns he Ins heretofore acted relative to n.Tairs in
Louisia, unless othe:-v,-ise controlled by Congress.
Tbe President reiterates his confidence in tiie
Indian peace policy. If adhered to lie s-iys it will
Froduce additional beneficial n suits, and ultimatHv
reethc fnmtierof Indian deprelations. He al
ludes to the civil service reform, saying it has been
s clely adhered to nn the opposition nnnifi steel
i" It permitted. Iu results have been beneficial, havr
ing elevated the capacity and tme of appointments
in tbe several departments of the govertunent. but
it would bo Impossible to continue the reform
without the direct support of Congress, sanctioned
by the people.

message, and ca4,! Mention io tlnir respective rc

The Old Democrats and Old Whigs.
The following remarks of the Richraoui
Whig will apply to Xorjh Carolina as ell
as to Virginia :
"It is a most conxdngive and gratifying
evidei.ee of the high patriotic spirit of the
Virginia people, to jsee isith what entire
forgetluliiess f the old i?sies and the old
prejudices of the past, our Whigs and
Democrats of other days are now frateruiz
ing in one brotherhood and fighting under
one flag.
There is no Slate in the Union in which
party feeling, founded upon honest differ
ences a to the great cardinal principles of
the Government, ever ran higher than it
did in Virginia when our people were polit
ically divided on lhoe grave questions of
national concern in the exposition and
elucidation of which the finest intellects of
the land were so often and so earnestly en
gaged, on the one side and theother; when
such colossal chiefs as Clay, Calhoun and
Webster, though, severally, direct repre
sentatives of their respective States, were
followed and sustained by constructive con
stituencies throughout the length and
breadth of the Union, when Federal politics
were freely discussed every day, and by al
most every man in the Common wealth, and
party lines were so sharply drawn between
Whig and Democrats in every city and
town, eveiy county and every neigh
borhood in the State, that social relations
between personal friends, and even rela
tives, were not uufrequently disturbed by
them. Theie was sincerity in both parties.
Joth were patriotic. Both were earnest in
their convictions. Botli were moved by m
tives of the most exalted consideration for
the public good.
The old Democrats believed in their
hearts tiial unless the principles of their
party were carried out rightly and fully to
their logical ends, the people would be
cursed with immeasurable misfortune, the
country would be submerged in the bit
terest waters of misrule and misery, and
the government would soon prove little
better than a failure and much worse than
a larce. The old Whigs were equally
impressed with an undoubting assurance
that the same sad results would certainly
ensue unless their peculiar political princi
ples were made to prevail in the manage
ment of Federal affairs. This pronounced
antagonism lasted and lingered longer in
Virginia, perhaps, than anywhere else iu
the Union. It had beeu abated, but it had
not altogether disappeared here when the
war came. And it is easy to imagine now,
in view ot the record of Radicalism from its
first possession of power to the present
hour, what an animated and interesting dis
putation might take place between an obi
Whig and an old Democrat of those de
parted days, as to the unfortunate want of
wisdom ou the part of the Americau peo
ple in ever permitting that new party to be
entrusted with the reins of government
each of them at the same time proving con
p'u i ely to himse.f, by in Q. iswerable argu
ment, that it his ptirty had not been beaten
wf should not only have had no war, but
that the Government would have been bet
ter, the people happier, and the country
more prosperous than ever before. As to
the war, that is a question we would leave
to be decided by the two old gentlemen
between themselves; it belongs to the past,
and nobody can be profited by a discussion
of the direct or indirect, the remote or im
mediate causes that brought it on. Rut as
to the revolutionary rule of Radicalism that
has followed it, both thp Democrat jjnd the
Whig would be right in maintaining that
the principles of his party would never have
led to any such condition of affairs, any
such derangement of the whole system of a
self-governing country, any such reckless
and ruinous violations of the constitution,
any such subordination and degradation of
the States, any such contemptuous disre
gard of the defences of civil liberty, any
such prostitution of the powers of the Gov
ernment to the oppression of the people,
as have resulted from the excesses, the
usurpations, the mad .counsels of the bad
party which has so nearly accomplished
the overthrow of free institutions, that the
American masses, in their might, and in
their fright, aroused to an energy of
patriotic purpose equal to the alarming im
minence, have commanded it to desist from
its. desperate designs against the life of the
Republic.
The Democratic party still ha a habita
tion and a name. The Whig party is
known no more, except in history, and there
it tills volumes which posterity will ponder
with admiration and pride. Hut the Dem
ocratic party ofthe present day is not alto
gether as it was in the days when the
Whigs were its only opponents. It has
hundreds of thousands of those same ojk
ponents undbtinguishahlv embraced in its
organization. Many of them are among
its best and ablest leaders. And it is not
unreasonable that it should be so. There
i nothing inconsistent in it on either side.
Democracy now has so much of the original
dements of Whiggery incorporated into it
that it would be hard for either of the two
old gentlemen we have introduced to tell
himself from the other in their party rela
tions as they stand now. There are old
Whig principle in the present Democratic
policy, and n wise man ofthe party would
consent to take them out. of it.
In Virgiuia, now, wo have our Conserva
tive party. It is made up of the old Whigs
and the old Demoerats of our State. And
they are so closely associated that none of
the differences of the past are left to traeo
tfro fligheft distinction between them.

A correspondent of tho Wilmington
Journal, writing from Raleigh during the
session of Conference, makes the lojioffr'ittg
nhsei vations about some of the members of
that body :
Tjjerc aru many notable men in tins Con
ference' j gipuped around the altar aru most
of those who hold a leading influence, and
."rv in osition Tocatoh the far of the Pre
siding Officer at any time when they wish
topeajc on a matter. Not, that there is
much speaking, (or this is emphatically a
working Conference. The Bishop an
nounced this evening, that ho had pasted
over iif arly all the regular business under
the calls required by the discipline; which
is a case unexampled in the bi?tory q( this
Conference. Never before has so much
wxrk fceen jdone in three jay. Of the men
grouped around the alter, the one who
strikes you amongst the first as a notable
man is theRer. Wm. Closs, D. D., whose
grey hairs and bald head are conspicuous,
where lliere are so few who are alike re
markable, for as a general thing, there is
tut much baldheadncss in the body.
Rev. Dr. Closs has been before the people
of North Carolina so long (now forty-two
yeanj) that he is thought to be Well-knowu,
and yet we are constraiued to say that he
is as little known as almost atiy man we
know of. There is a depth of solid piety
and gushing feeling in the Doctor's constitu
tion, which is known of by but few who see
him.
The Bishop alluded to the fact that for
"lo these many years" the question had
been asked in Conference, 'is there any
thing against Brother Closs?" and the
answer has been "nothing." Dr. Closs in
reply stated that he had now arrived at the
year of his age in which all of his family
had died his father, his brother and per
haps others and that he was living as if
every day was to be the last. Every ser
mon, every prayer, every quarterly meet
ing and every exhortation were delivered,
and held as though they were the last ex
ercises he would ever have on earth. The
tears rolled down his cheeks and bis very
frame seemed to sob with deep feeling.
The scene was very affecting and nearly
the entire audience was in tears. We are
reminded that the papers of this week
contain an account of his last sermon
preached in his District, which was deliv
ered with wonderful power and unction.
But we must pass away from this train of
thought.
Bishop Marvin is surrounded bv a coun
cil of Presiding Elders. Rev. W. S. Black,
Presiding Elder ofthe Wilmington District,
is a notable man. Of deep piety, a gentle
christian spirit, an engaging manner and a
good preacher, he is fast making his way
into the hearts of his people, and bids fair to
have a career of great usefulness. lie is so
well known that it is not neccessary to add
more. Near him is Rev. L. S. Burkhead,
D. D., of the Shelby District, who is also
well known in the Cape Fear Section. He
wields the same long sword iu preaching
which he has long carried, and if he has a
failing, it is his jealousy for tbe honor of the
Church and his desire to "pitch in" to all
her opponents.
Rev. E. A. Yates, ofthe Newbern Dis
trict, sits uear'him. Mr Yates is over six
feet in height, rather spare built, turning
grey very fast ami is noted as a preacher
who gathers crowds to hear him, and
preaches with great acceptability. Some
say his gesticulation is rather loose when
he gets excited, but we have not noticed it
much, though we have heard him many
times. He has one very useful faculty and
that is, that he knows every body, every
where, and can call their names when he
meets them. Then there is Rev. Wra. H.
Bobbitt, of the Raleigh District, compara
tively a young man and yet an old preach
er. Wlij', when the degree of D. D. is
floating around so much, none of the colleges
have given it to him is rather a wonder,
for he is in labors abundant, kind and affec
tionate, preaches with power, liking to
dwell particularly on the love, of God, gen
ial, whole-souled and full of honor.
The Conference room was crowded all
the time, the galleries being filled with
ladies from all parts of the State who came
up to hear the reports of the progress of
their beloved Methodism.
South Carolina
Governor Chamberlain's Inaugural is
bold, able, manly and seemingly dictated
by honest purposes. He only tells his con
stituents that iu the late canvass the two
political parties which sought supremacy
were equally emphatic in their demand for
the correction of abuses. He says that he
will, therefore, rely for support upon those
members of the General Assembly who
were opposed to him, as confidently as upon
those who favored his election. The para
mount duty, he says, is the practice and en
forcement of economy and honesty in the
administration of tho government.
Though intensely radical himself, he does
not seek to conceal the reckless expendi
tures and maladministration of his party.
He says the chief evils are those of adminis
tration, and he suggests that the earliest
and most earnest attention must be given
to the subject of the co)lectjo.n, appropria
tion and disbursement of tiie pubHc funds.
He admits that the valuations of property
for taxation have been unjust and oppres
sive but the total assessments have beeu
reduced thirty or forty millions dollars this
year, and he is ready, he says, to co-operate
with the General Assembly in auy measure
calculated to obtain a just valuation of all
properly for taxation according to its true
;;;ojj,cy vIue, and, so far as the faithful exe
cution of the law depends jiipon officers ap
pointed by hjuij no comity tdjalj have just
cause for complaint. The contingent funds,
which have consumed $376,732 in the past
six years, should be totally abolished.
The regular Legislative expenses of each
session have averaged f;320,4(j5, and in three
years the public pointing cost the State
918,620. He recommends that the Legis
Jature reduce its session to 30 days ami dis
continue the practice of publishing the laws
am advertisements.
Chamberlain's Juangural is a plain but
incisive exhibit of partizan profligacy, but
we hope he is honest in his declared inten
tions to aid in effecting a reformation.

December 8. Senate The House reso
lution denouncing the Civil Rights bill was
taken up for concurrence. Mr Canlwell
offered a substitute opposing any interfer
ence of Congress with the-schools for the
r ices, or entertainment at hotels, and advo
cating separate churches, separate militia
system, burial places for the dead, tfcc, and
endorsing the bill now pending in Congress
if it adopt such amendments as these, as a
measure of the wisest statesmanship and a
final settlement of this question. He fol
lowed this substitute with a speech of great
length. He swept all around, referring to
Mr Waring for refusing to vote limbs to
disabled Union soldiers in tbe State, and
stricturing the Senate for objecting to the
word "rebellion" iu his Mexican pension
bill for North Carolina veterans. He de
fended Grant's administration there bad
been more money stolen at one time by one
man in New York city, and that man no
member of Grant's party, than had been
spent in Grant's whole term. These gen
tlemen who denounced this bill as "loath
some legislation" were mere neophytes in
the democratic party, didn't know what
they were talking about, had been misled
by the voice of the prejudiced aud the
vulgar. Without regard to the speech of

master General Jewell. The former con
sists of lour blooded bay horses, which are
generally driven to a landualet, the Iwiicm
being .silver mounted, and their appearance
on the street always attracts considerable
attention, lrom the fact that they arcalwavn
driven in fine masterly style, and are o
beautifully matched. Tbe turnout of Pout,
master General Jewell is generally couiid

city. He drives iu his landeau two mag
nificent blacks that can make their milo
easily iuside of 2:50, and their style of ac
