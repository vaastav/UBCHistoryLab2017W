Facts Regarding Purchase.
Chief Executive Declares Government
Should Prosecute Defaming Editor.
Charges of Graft Called String oi
Infarr.cus Libels.
President Roosevelt sent to ccn-
gress TudSuay a statement concerning
the purchase of the Panama canal
property by the United States , de
nouncing in strong language charges
that there was anything wrong in the
acquisition of the canal. Ke says :
"In view of the constant reiteration
of the assertion that there was some
corrupt action by or on behalf of the
"United States government in connec
tion with the acquisition of the title
of the French company to the Panama
canal , and of the repetition of the
story that a syndicate of American
citizens owned either one or both of
the Panama companies , I deem it wise
to submit to the congress all the in
formation I have on the subject.
These stories were first brought to my
attention as published in a paper in
Indianapolis , called the News , edited
by Mr. Delevan Smith. The stories
were scurrilous and libclous in char
acter and' false in every essential par-
ticular. Mr. Smith shelters himself
behind the excuse that he merely ac
cepted the statements which had ap
peared in a paper published in New
York , the World , owned by Mr. Jo
seph'Pulitzer. It is idle to say that
the known character of Mr. Pulit
zer and his newspaper are such that
the statements in that paper will be
believed by nobody. Unfortunately ,
thousands of persons are ill-informed
in this respect and believe the state
ments they see in print , even though
they appear in a newspaper published
by Mr. Pulitzer
"The story repeated at various times
by the World and by its followers in
the nev.spaper press is substantially
as follows : That there was corrup
tion by or on behalf of the government
of the United States in the transac-
tion by which the Panama canal prop
erty was acquired Irom its French
owners ; that there were improper
dealings of some kind between agents
of the government and outside per
sons , representing or acting for an
American company ; that "among these
persons , who it was alleged made
"huge profits , " were Mr. Charles P.
Taft , a brother of Mr. William H Taft ,
then a candidate for the presidency ,
and Mr. Douglas Robinson , my brother-
in-law.
"These statements sometimes appear
in the editorials , sometimes in the
news columns , sometimes in the shape
of contributions from individuals eith
er unknown or known to be of bad
character. They are false in every
particular from beginning to end. The
wickedness of the slanderers is only
surpassed by their fatuity So utterly
baseless are the stories that apparent
ly they represent in part merely mate
rial collected for campaign purposes
and in part stories originally con
cocted with a view of possible black
mail. Now , these stories as a matter of
fact need no investigation whatever.
No shadow of proof has been , or can
be , produced' in behalf cf any of them.
They consist simply of a string of in
famous libels. In form they are in
part libels upon individuals , upon Mr.
Taft and Mr. Robinson for instance
But they are in fact wholly and in
form partly a libel upon the United
States government. I do not believe
we should concern ourselves with the
particular individuals who wrote the
articles.
"The real offneder is Mr. Joseph Pu
litzer , editor and proprietor of the
World. While the criminal offense of
which Mr. Pulitzer has been guilty is
in form a libel upon individuals , the
great injury done is in blackening the
good name of the American people. It
should net be left to a private citizen
to sue Mr. Pulitzer for libel. He
should be prosecuted for libel by the
government authorities. In point of
:
encouragement of iniquity , in point of
infamy o : wrcngccing , there is noth
ing to cheese between a public servant
who betrays his trust , a public ser
vant who is guilty of blackmail , or
I
tlieit , or financial dishonesty of any >
kind , and a man gu'ltv ' as Mr Joseph
Pulitzer has been guilty in this in
stance. It is therefore a high national
duty to bring to justice this villifer of
the American people , this man who
wantonly and wickedly and without
one shadow of justification seeks to
blacken the character of reputable
citizens and to convict the govern
ment of his own country in the eyes
of the civilized world of wrongdoing
of the basest and foulest kind , when
he has not one shalow : of justification
of any sort or description for the
charge he has made. The attorney
general has under consideration the
form in which the proceedings against
Mr. Pulitzer will be brought. "
"So far as this government is con
cerned , " concludes the president , "ev
ery step of the slightest importance has
been made public bv its executive. "
Message on Brcwn-ville Affair.
The president sent 'a message to
the senate Monday on the Brownsville
affair , reiterating all that ha-i been
charged against the colored soldiers
concerned in shooting up the town ,
but recommending the reinstatement
of any of the dismissed troops who
might now come forward and satisfy
competent authority of disposition to
tfll ihc truth and purge themselves
of the contempt and conspiracy of si
lence dprlnrorl to have marked tie
original inquiry.
LONGBOAT WINS RACE.
Italian Runner Collapses in Sight ol
the Goal.
As on the memorable occasion cf his
, first Olympiad , Dorando Pietri Col
lapsed within sight of the goal Tues
day nis'nt ana Torn Longboat , the Indian
dd
dian runner , who had been led by a
yard or more nearly all the way , won
I the Marathon race at Madison Square
Garden , New York.
The race was hard fought from
start to finish and kept the thousands
of spectators in wild excitement At'
j1
twenty-five miles Dorancio was leading
by two yards. A moment before Longboat -
boat had made a remarkable spurt aud
put himself on an even ioct.ng with
the little Italian. Dorando immedi
ately regained first position and the
men were fighting it out in the twen
ty-sixth mile , with Dorando in the
lead , but visibly weaker. The chances' '
Longboat appeared to improve-
the second and third laps. In the
fourth lap , while the crowd was cry
ing itself hoarse , both men slackened
perceptibly. Then suddenly Dorando
staggered and dropped. Longtoat fin
ished alone. His time for the distance
of 26 miles. 385 yards was 2:45:052-5. : :
The time was 35 3-5 seconds slower
than the Marathon mark established
by Dorando when he defeated Hayes
over the same track three weeks ago.
It was a gruelling race for nearly
one-half miles with
twenty-five and - ,
the Italian generally in the lead , but
occasionally overhauled by a wonder
ful spurt on the part of the Indian.

Supreme Court Decides lie
Need Not Answer.
'
Interstate Body.Not Entitled to Pre : > s
Questions Relative to private Transactions -
! ! actions Marian , McKenna and Day
' File Dissenting Opinion.
In an opinion handed down Monday
j by Justice Holmes , the supreme cou t
! ; oj the United States heid that E. II.
Harriman and Otto Kahn , the latter aNew
*
New York banker , should not be re
quired to answer the interstate coia-
merce commission s questions con
cerning dealings in stocks between the
Union Pacific and other roads , to
which they'refused''tfc'L\ake response
when the subject was under investiga
tion in New York ' - -
In deciding the case the supreme
court held that the commission is not
entitled under the interstate com
merce law to press questions relative
to private transactions , even though
they involve dealings in the securities
of interstate railroads when the in
vestigation of which such questions
are a part has been begun upon the
commission's initiative. The opinion
dealt with the refusal of Messrs. Har
riman and Kahn to make reply to
questions put by the commission in
the course of an inquiry concerning
the dealings of Mr. Harriman as president -
ident of the Union Pacific railroad in
stocks of other railroad companies ,
many of which are competing lines.
Justice Holmes said the commission's
inquiries should be confined to cases
in which complaint had' been made.
He said privacy should be properly
regarded in proceedings begun by the
commission for its own purposes and
that the powers conferred in the inter
state commerce law exceeded any
which have ever been delegated by a
constitutional body of lawmakers.
In a dissenting opinion concurred
in by Justices Harlan and McKenna ,
Justice Day declared that the effect
of the opinion of the majority of the
court would be materially to narrow
the scope of the interstate commerce
law. These three justices declared' tl.e
questions of the commission , so far
as they were sustained by the United
States circuit court for the Northern
district of New York , were entirely
proper and should have been answered
by Harriman and Kahn. Justice Har
lan I ; went even farther and held that
all of the commission's questions
should have received responses. Jus
tice : Moody did not participate in tue
case.
FANATIC TERRORIZES TOWN.
Mad Man From Nebraska Shot Down
in Edgewater , N. J.
Proclaiming himself to be "John ,
the Baptist , nme to save the world , "
an armed fanatic terrorized the
town of Edgewater , N. J. , for
an hour. He appeared suddenly on tbe
main street , flourished a revolver ai d
exchanged many shots with a hastily
formed posse and at last fell woundeJ.
Nobody else was hurt. In the midst
of the excitement the madman seized
a horse and wagon and tried to escape
before he was shot down. The man ,
gray whiskered and apparently about
fifty-five years of age , said he was
Oscar S. Pomeroy , and that his home
was in Nebraska , but that he had been
an inmate of a private sanitarium in
Stamford , Conn. He was ordered
taken to the state asylum at Morris
Plains , where he will be detained
pending other proceedings.
DUTCH CRUISER SEIZES SHIP.
Flag of Holland is Run Up to Mast
Head of Venezuelan Vessel.
The Dutch cruiser Gelderland cap
tured the Venezuelan coast guardship
Alix outside Puerto Cabello. The
Dutch flag was hoisted over the Alix ,
the crew of which was sent ashore.
The guardship was then manned by a
Dutch officer and marines and towea
to Willemstad. Although the seizure
of the Alix was plainly discernible
from Puerto Cabello , the forts therea
did not fire on the Gelderland. There
is great enthusiasm over the incident
in Curacao.
Northcote Praises American Fleet.
Words of praise for the American
battleship fleet and its officers and
men were uttered by Lord North
cote , retiring governor general of Aus
tralia , at a luncheon in his honor at
the Lawyers' club in New York. Lord
Northcote said the vessels gave Aus
tralians a broader conception of the
importance j and power of the nation
across the Pacific from them thr.n
they had before the visit. Of great ? r
consequence , however , he regardt d
the fact that the appearance and conduct -
duct of their officers and men created
an impression to their credit that Le
believed would be everlasting.
