THE TOItPKDO 8EUVICK.
\t As germane to this subject I call your at-
g.4tlon to the importance of perfecting our
rCrpedo defences. The board authorized
by the lustcongrehs to report on the method
which be adopted for the manufacture of
heavy ordnance adopted to- general ware-
fare lias been as slsted by the principal iron
and steel works , In this country and in Eu
rope. It IB hoped that its report will be
soon made and thatjcongress will thereupon
be disposed to provide suitable facilities
and plans for the manufacture of such guns
t JLS are now imperatively needed.
THE BTATK MILITIA.
On several occasions during the past year
ofilecMof the armv have , at the request of
the state authorltfes. visited their military
encampments for the inspection of the
troops. From the reports of these officers
I nm induced to believe that the encourage
ment of state militia organization by the na
tional government would be followed by
very gratifying results , and would afford
it in sudden emergencies the aid of a large
body of volunteers educated in the per
formance of military duties. .
TUB NKWWAll VESSELS.
The secretary of the navy reports that
under the authority of the acts of August f ,
1882 , and March 3 , 188.1 , the work of
strengthening our navy by the construction
of modern vessels has been auspiciously be
gun. Three cruisers are now in progress of
construction the Chicago , 6f 4 , . " > 00 tons
displacement , and the Boston and Atlanta ,
each of 2.00 tons. They are to be built of
Hteel , with the tcnible strength and durability
presribed by law , and in combination of
speed. endurance and armament are ex
pected to compare favorably with the best
war vessels of other nations. A fourth veb-
scl , the Dolphin , is to be constructed of
feimilar material , and it ) intended to serve as
a fleet dispatch boat. The double-turretcd
monitors , Puritan , Amphritc and Terror ,
have been launched on the Delaware river ,
and a contract has been made for the supply
of their machinery. A similar monitor , the
Madanock , has been launched in California.
The naval advisory board and the secretary
recommend the completion of the mouitorn
and the construction of four gunboats , and
also of three additional steel vessels like the
Chicago , Boston and Dolphin as an impor
tant measure of material defense.
INCUKA8IKO OUK NAVAL 8TKENGTH.
The secretary xirges also tne Immediate
creation of an "interior fast line of water
ways across the peninsula of Florida , along
the" coast from Florida to Hampton Koads ,
between the Chesapeake bay and Delaware
river and through Cape Cod. I feel bound
to impress upon the attention of congress
the necessity of continued progress in the
reconstruction of the navy. The condition
of the public treasury , as 1 have already in
timated , makes the present an auspicious
time for putting this nranch of service in a
state of efficiency. It is no part of our
policy to en-ate and maintain a navy able to
cope with that of the other great powers of
the world. We have no wi-h for foreign
conquest , and the peace which we have
long enjoyed is in no seeming danger of in-
tenuption , but that our naval strength
should be made adequate for the defense of
our harbors , the protection of our commer
cial interests , and the maintenance of our
national honor , is a proposition from vvbiuh
no patriotic citizen can withhold his con
sent.
TQE POSTAL SERVICE.
f
The report of the postmaster general con
tains a gratifying exhibit of the condition
and prospects of this interesting branch of
the public service committed to his care. It
appears that on June 30 , 1883. th whole
number of postoffices was 47,803 , of which
1,032 were established during the last pre
vious fiscal year. The number of offices
operating under the system of free delivery
was 154. At these latter offices the postage
on local matter amounted to $ il,9f > 2.305.-
225 a sum exceeding by 51,021,81.05 the
entire cost of the carriers' service of the
country. . The rate of postage on drop let
ters passing through these offices is now fix
ed by law at two cents per half ounce or
fraction thereof. In offices where the car
rier system has not been established the rate
If only half as large.
A REDUCTION PKOrOSEP.
It will be remembered that in 1863 , when
free delivery was first established by law ,
the uniform single rate postage upon local
letters was one cent , and so it remained un-
Jil 1872. when' In those cities where carrier
'
service'was established it was increased to
defray the expense of such service. It
seems to me that the old rate may now with
propriety be restored , and that , too , even
at the risk of diminishing for a time at least
the receipts from postage upon load letters.
I can see no reason why that particular
class of .mail .matter should be held double
for the entire cost , not only of its collection
and delivery but the collection and delivery
of all other elapses ; and I am confident" ,
after final consideration of the subject , that
the reduction of rate would be followed by
such a growing accession of business as to
occasion but Blight and temporary loss to
the revenues to tf
THE TELEGRAPH QUKSTIOX.
The postmaster-general devotes much of
his report to the consideration in its various
aspects of the government to the telegraph.
Such reflection as I have been able to give
to this subject , xlnce my last annual mes
sage , has not led me to change the-view
which I then expressed in dissenting from
"
the recommendation "of the postmaster-
general that the government assumes the
same control over the telegraph which ithas
'
always exercised over the'mail. Admitting
that its authority in the premises as ample
as has ever been claimed for it. It would not
in iny judgment bo a wlso use of that au
thority to purchase or assume the control of
existing telegraph lines , ortoconstrurt oth
er * wiih a view of entering into general
competition with private enterprise. The
objections which may be jut-tly urged
against either of these "projects , and indeed
against any system which would require an
enormous increase in the civil service list ,
Vdo not , however , apply to some of the
/plans which have lately provoked public
comment and discussion. It has been
claimed for example , that congress migh't
widely authorize the poftmaater-gcncral to
contract with some private person or cor
poration for the transmission of messages
at specified r.ttes and under government
supervision.
GOVERNMENT SCrKRVISIOlf.
Various such schemes of the same general
aature , but widely differing in their special
characteristics , have been suggested in the
public prints , and the arguments by which
tbeyhave been suggested and opposed have
doutaJfess attracted your attention. It is
likely that the whole subject will be coneid-
by you at the"pre'sent session. In the
re of things it involves BO many ques-
of detail that your deliberations would
bahly be aided slightly , if at all. by any
.particular suggestion * which I might , now
submit. I avow my belief , .however , that
the government should be authorized by
law to exercise pome sort of FtipervNioa
over inter-dtato telegraph communication ,
and express the hope that for attaining
that end Home measure may be devised
which will receive your approbation.
THE COURTS.
< The attorney general criticises , in his re
port , the provisions of existing laws fixing
the fees of Jurors and witnesses in the fed
eral courts. The provisions are chiefly con
tained in the act of February 20 , 1853 ,
though home of them were introduced into
that act from statutes which had been passed
many years previous. It is manifest that
such compensation as might , when those
laws were enacted , have been just and rea
sonable , would In many instances be justly
regarded at the present day as wholly inade
quate.
THK MATTKR OK SALARY.
I concur with the attorney general in the
belief that the statutes should b icvised by
which these fees are regulated ; so , too ,
should the lawn which regulate the compen
sation of district attorneys and marshals.
They should be paid wholly by salaries in
stead of in part by fees , as is now the case.
The change would prove to be a measure of
economyO and would discourage the insti
tution of needless and oppressive legal pro
ceedings , which , it is to be feared , have in
some Instances been conducted for the mere
sake of personal gain.
JNTEIOfAL. AKFAIUS.
3Iuch interesting and varied information
is contained In the report of the secretary of
the interior. I particularly call your atten
tion to his presentation of certain phrases of
the Indian question , to nis recommendations
for the repeal of the pre-emption and tim
ber culture acts , and for more stringent
legislation to prevent frauds under the pen
sion laws. The statute * which preherve the
definitions and punishments of crimes rela
ting to pensions could doubtless be made
more eifectlvc by certain amendments and
additions which are pointed out in the treas
ury report.
" FEDERAL Al KOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
I have previously referred to the alarming
state of illiteracy in certain portions of the
country , and again submit for the consider
ation of congress whether some federal aid
should be extended to public primary edu-
cution when adequate provision therefore
nas not already been made.
THK 1'OLYOAMY ULCKB.
The Utah commission hew submitted to the
secretary of the interior it second annual re
port , with full particulars of Its labors in that
\-rntory. pursuant to the act of March ' i ,
Ts&J. It appeufs that the persons by that act
disqualified , to the number of about 12,000 ,
were oxcludcd from the polls , This fact , how
ever , affords little cause for congratulation ,
and I fear that it is far from iutlicating' any
real and substantial progress toward the ex
tirpation of polygamy. All of the members
of the legislature are Mormons. There Is
grave reason to beliuvo that they arc in sym
pathy with the practice.- * that this government
is seeking to MIpin-eM , and that its efforts in
that regard will be more lil-ulyto encounter
their opposition thiin to receive their encour
agement and support.
MORE STIilXGENT LAV.'S NEEDED.
Even if this view should happily be er
roneous the law under which the commis
sioners have been acting should be made
more effectual by the incorporation of some
such stringent measures as they recom
mend , as were included in bill No. 2 , 38 ,
on the calendar of the senate at its lust ses
sion. I am convinced , however , that
polygamy has become so strongly intrench
ed in the Territory of Utah that it is profit
less to attack with any but the stoutest
weapons which constitutional legislation can
make. I favor , therefore , the repeal of the
act upon which the existing government de
pends , the resumption by the national
legislature of the entire political control of
the territory , and the establishment of a
commission with such powers and duties
as shall be delegated to it by law.
AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT.
The department of agriculture is accom
plishing much in the direction of the agri
cultural development of the country and
the report of the commissioner giving the
results of his investigations and experi
ments will be fotind interesting and valu
able. At his instance a convention of those
interested in the cattle industry of the coun
try was lately held at Chicago. The preva
lence of pleuro-pneuraonia and other con
tagious diseases of animals was one of the
chief topics of discussion. A committee of
the convention will invite your co-operation
in Investigating the causes of these diseases
and providing methods for their perventioH
und cure

THK NEEDS OK ALASKA .
I trust that congress will not fall at its
present session to put Alaska under the pro
tection of law. - Ita people have repeatedly
remonstrated against our neglect to afford
them the maintenance and protection ex
pressly guaranteed by the terms of the
treaty whereby that territory was ceded to
the United States. For sixteen years they
have pleaded in vain , f or that which they
should have received without the asking.
They have no law for the collection of debts ,
the support of education , the conveyance of
property , the administration of estates or
the enforcement of contracts ; none , indeed ,
for.the punishment of criminals except puch
as offered against certain customs , com
merce and navigation acts.
The resources of Alaska , especially in fur ,
mines and lumber , are considerable in extent - .
tent and capable of large development ,
while itB geographical situation is one of
political and commercial importance. The
promptings of interest , therefore , as well
as considerations ' of honor and good faith
demand th'e immediate establishment of
civil Kovernment in that territory.
RAILWAY ABUSES.
Complaints have lately been frequent and
urgent that certain corporations , controlling
in whole or in part the facilities for the interstate
ter-state carriage of persons and merchan
dise upon the great rail roads of the country ,
have resorted m their dealings with the pub
lic to diverse measures , unjust and oppres
sive in their character. In some instances
the state court * have attacked and sup
pressed these evils , but In others they have
been unable to afford an equal protection
because of the juriodictional limitations
which are imposed upon-tbcm by the federal -
al corporation.
GOVERNMENT SUPERVISION ,
The question , how far the national gov
ernment may lawfully interfere In the prem
ises , and what , if any , supervision or con
trol it ought to exercise , is one which merits
your careful consideration. While we can
not fail to recognize thtf Importance of the
vast Tallway svste'ms of the country , and
their great "and beneficial influence * upon
the development of our material wealth , we
hhould , on the other hand , remember that
the individual and no corporation ought to
be Invested with ab"olute power over the
interest of other citizens or class of citizens.
CONGRESS SHOULD PROTECT TUB MIOPLK.
The right of the railway corporations to
demand a profitable return upon their in
vestments and to a reasonable freedom in
their regulations must be recognized , but it
heoms only Just , to far as Its constitutional
authority will permit , that congress should
protect the people at large in their Inter
state traffic against acts of injuf-tlce which
the Htate governments are powerless to pre
vent.
FOREST PRESERVATION" .
In rarliwt annual message I called atten-
" - - -
"T  - - '
tion to the necessity of protecting by suit
able legislation the forests situated upon the
public domain. In many portions of the
west the pursuit of general agriculture is
only made practicable by the resort to irri
gation , whfle such useful irrigation would
be impossible without the aid afforded by
the forests in contributing to the regularity
and constancy of such supply of water.
During the past year severe suffering and
great loss of property have been occasioned
by prof use floods , followed by periods of
unusually low water in many of the great
rivers of the couutry. These irregularities
are caused by the removal from about the
sources of the streams in question , of the
timber by which the water supply has been
nourished and protected.
IMPOIITANCIJ OK TUB KORK8TS.
The preservation of such , portion of the
forest on too national domain as essentially
contributes to the equitable flow of impor
tant water courses , is of the highest cense
quence. Important tributaries of the Mis
souri , the Columbia and the Saskatchewan
rise in the mountains of Montana , near the
northern boundary of the United States ,
oetween theBlaekfcet and Flathcad Indian
reservation1 ? . This region Is unsuitable for
settlement , but upon the rivers which flow
from ft depends in the future the agricul
tural development of a vast tract , of coun
try. The attention of congress is called to
the necessity of withdrawing from thepub-
licjsale this part of the public domain and
establishing there a forest preserve.
INDUSTRIAL EXHIBITIONS.
The industrial exhibitions which have
been held in the United States during the
resent year attracted attention in many
foreign countries where the announcement
of those enterprises had been made public
through foreign agencies of the government.
The industrial exhibition at Boston , and the
southern exposition at Louisville were
largely attended by the exhibitors of foreign
countries , notwithstanding the absence of
any professional character in those under
takings. The centennial exposition to be
held next vearatNcvvOrleansin commemo
ration of tfie century of the first shipment of
cotton from a port of the United States ,
bids fair with a like gratifying success. Un
der the act of congress . of the 10th of Febru-
ary. 188. . dec aring that exposition to be
national and inter-imtion.il in ite character ,
foreign governments with which the United
State * maintain relations have been invited
to participate. The promoters of this im
portant undertaking have already received
assurances of the lively interest which is ex
cited abroad.
DISTRICT OK COLUMBIA.
The report of the commissioners of the
District of Columbia is herewith transmit
ted. I ask for it your careful attention ,
especially for those portions which relate to
assessments for arrears of taxes und water
supply.
THK cmt. SEKYICJ : .
The commissioners who were appointed
under the act of July 10 , I8i > 2 , entitled ' 'An
act to reirulate and improve the civil service '
of the United States , " entered promptly
upon the discharge of these duties. A se
ries of rules , framed in accordance with the
spirit of the statue , was approved and pro
mulgated by the president of the United
States , and in sonic particulars wherein they
seemed defective , these rules were subse
quently amended. It will provide for the
discountenance of any political or religious
tests for admission to the offices of the pub
lic service to which the statutes relate. The
act is limited in its original application to
the classified clerkships in the several execu
tive departments at Waahiftgtoa , number
ing about 5,000 , and to similar positions in
customs districts and postoffices where as
many as fifty persons are emoloyed , a class
ification of these positions analo'gous to that
existing in the Washington offices was duly
made before the law went into effect.
Eleven customs districts and twenty-three
po.stoffices were thus brought under the im
mediate operation of the statute.
WORKINGS OF THE SY8TKM.
The annual report of the civil service
commission" which wHl soon be submitted to
congress , will doubtless afford the means of
a more definite judgment than I am now
prepared to express as to the merits of the
new system. I am persuaded that its
effects have thus far proved beneficial. Its
practical methods appear to be adequate for
the ends proposed , and there has peen no
serious difficulties in carrying them into ef
fect. Since the 16th of July last no person ,
so far as I am aware , has been appointed to
the public service in the classified portions
thereof at any of the departments , or any of
the postoffices and custom districts above
named , except those certified by the com
mission to be most competent on the basis of
the examination held in conformity to the
rules. '
THK PRESIDENCY AND ITS POWERS.
At the time when the present executive
entered upon his term of office his death ,
removal , resignation or inability to dis
charge his duties would have left the gov
ernment without a constitutional head.
It is probable , of course , that a
similar contingency may again arise
unless the wisdom of " > congress shall
.provide against its recurrence. The
senate &t its last session , after full
consideration , passed an act relating to the
subject which will now , I trust , commend
Itself to the approval of both houses of con
gress. The clause of the constitution upon
which must depend any law regulating the
prcsidenllal succession presents also for
solution other questions of paramount Im
portance. These questions relate to the
proper interpretation of the phrase "in
ability to discharge the powers and duties
of said office. "
IMPORTANT 'QUESTION TO BE 8KTTLBD.
Our organic law provides that when the
president suffer from much inability , the
presiding officer shall devolve upon the vice-
president , who may himself , under Hfo cir
cumstances , give place to such officer as
congress may by law appoint to act an presi
dent. I here set forth numerous and inter
esting inquiries which are suggested by
these words of the constitution. They were
fully stated in "my first communication to
congress , and have been the subject of fre
quent deliberations in that body. It is
greatly to be hoped that these momentous
questions will find speedy ( solutions Ieet an
emergency may arise when long delay will i
be impossible , and any determination , 1
albeit the widest , may furnish cause for
anxiety wid alarm. 1J
THK VKTO POWKR.
For the reasons fully stated in my la t an "JJ
nual message , I repeat my recommendation J
that congress propose an amendment to that J.J
provision of 'the constitution which pre J
scribes the formalities for the enactment of 1
laws wlieroby , in respect to bills for the ap (
propriation of public money , the executive If
may be able , while giving hi * approval to f
particular items , to interpo-e his veto as to ]
such ethers as do not commend tbemselves 1i
to his Judgment.
CIVIL HIGHTSi ]
The fourteenth amendment of the constitution - " *
tution confers the right of citizenship upon 1
all persons born or naturalized in the United i
Stawe , and subject to the jurisdiction there-1'
of. It was the special purpose of the amend
ment to insure members of the colored race
the full enjoyment of civil and political
rights. Certain statutory provisions intended
to secure the enforcement of thows rights
have been recently declared "unconstitution
al by the supreme court. Any legislation
whereby congress may lawfully supplement
the guarantees which the constitution af
fords for the equal enjoyment by all the citi
zens of the United States , of every right ,
privilege and Immunity of citizenship , will
receive my unhesitating approval.

An Interesting Patent Suit. .
An interesting case , involving a very
ingenious and economical device , has just
been decided by the courts , the particulars
of which will bear mention. Nel-on Lyon ,
of Albany , N. Y. , has recovered judgment
of 8,44t.lO , besides co-ts and interest
against G. T. Fisher & Co. , in the United
States Circuit Court , at Detroit , Mich. ,
for an Infringement of what is known to the
trade as Lyon's Patent Metalic Heel Stiffen-
er. This contrivance is one of the most Use
ful of modern Inventions , and has achieved
a remarkable sale over three-quarters of .a
million dollars worth , the testimony in the
present suit showed , having been disposed
of since the patent was granted , being a
grand total of 273,478 pounds , or 3,858,000
pairs. The invention consists of a neat metal
plate fastening to the outside of a boot or
shoe heel , and HO arranged as to prevent the
counters from breaking over and the heel
from wearing down unevenly. It is a simple
but verv ingenious device , and so de
sirable oh the score of comfort and economy
that infringements were boldly made. At
one time the Attorney General of the United
States declared the Lyon patent invalid ,
simplv on account of an informality in the
application , but this was afterward corrected
by the Commissioner of Patents' , in accord
ance with a special act of Congress authoriz
ing such correction. Fisher , main improve
ment consisted in elongating the screw-hole
fastening the plate , and , as defendants , they
based their main defence in trying to show
the special act of ConereM wa unconstitu
tional and that plaintiff's invention was not
new. Action was commenced in May , 18SO ,
a perpetual injunction was obtained" De
cember following , and the case was re
ferred to a master to ascertain the profits
made by defendants and the loss sustained
by 3Ir. Lyon. The master reported the
sum as S3,834 , but on motion the court
doubled the same and directed judgment to
be entered against defendants for such
double damages , with interest from the date
of the master's report , and costs.
