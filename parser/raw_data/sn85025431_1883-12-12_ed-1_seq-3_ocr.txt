THE TRANSCRIPT
OFFICIAL PAPER OF THE CITY.
Entered AS sucond-class matter at the post office at
Austin, Minnesota.
C. H. DAVIDSON, Editor and Proprietor.
AUSTIN. WEDNESH.A V'.LDECEMBER 12,1883.
WKL.COAIE.
It is with feelings of hearty good will,
and of genuine satisfaction, that we wel­
come to our city and homes the officers
and delegates of the Minnesota gutter
and Cheese Association, which convened
in the court-house last evening.
We have anticipated your coming as
an auspicious event in the annals of our
farming community. It has long been
felt that a departure from the old methods
and employments must be made before
that degree of temporal prosperity which
we have been toiling for so long can be
secured.
We are conscious that the fertile lands,
so many thousands of acres of which are
lying unimproved about us, need only
the magic touch of the right kind of en­
terprise to make them immensely pro­
ductive. What has been done in other
localities, can be affected in Mower and
adjoining counties, now impoverished
from partial failures in crops.
We have anticipated that the advent of
so large a number of skilled and experi­
enced dairymen, bringing to our farmers
the results of their investigations and
efforts, will stimulate them to persistent
and enthusiastic endeavors to turn into
golden profit the suggestions offered
during the Convention.
Not only do we welcome you as bene­
factors, the results of whose labors will
be manifest in years to come in the in­
crease of our visible prosperity, but we
esteem it a privilege to meet in conven­
tion so many of the sturdy yeomanry of
our state, the men and the women upon
whose broad shoulders and patient hearts
are laid the foundations of the progress
and wealth of our noble state. We are
glad to join hands with you in promoting
the development of the resources of this
queen state of the north. But while we
have been waiting for better davs we have
not been idle, bat aggressive, as may be
seen by the beautiful court-house, in
which you have already held your first
session, the finest in the state.
We can also point with pride to our
numerous new blocks, finished up in first
class style, and occupied by live mer­
chants ready to welcome the first wave of
decided improvement in our agricultural
affairs.
In communicating freely for our bene­
fit we trust you will find the sessions of
the convention promotive of your own
welfare, and return home at length, bet­
ter fitted for the succes ful prosecution
of your industries, assured that you bear
with you the best wishes of your Austin
friends.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
In accordance with the time-honored
custom, President Arthur presented his
annual message at the opening of the
winter session of Congress. It is a very
conservative document, and contains but
little more than a resume of the reports
submitted to him by his cabinet.
He speaks at some length upon our
"Foreign Relations," which he sums up
as in a "most favorable condition." We
are at peace with all nations, and all those
matters which concern our intercourse
with them are adjusted readily and amic­
ably.
The Treasury reports an income from
all sources of $398,287,581, with an ex­
penditure of $265,308,137, leaving a sur
plus of $132,-879,444. This surplus has
been devoted to the reduction of the na
tional debt.
The President recommends the reduc­
tion of the revenue in order both to ligh­
ten the burden of taxation and prevent
the disarrangement of finances by with­
drawing the bonds in which the National
Banks give their security.
The trade dollar he would have re­
tired, and redeemed at a small per centage.
Until the revenues are reduced to equal
only the necessary expenses of the gov­
ernment, he would have the surplus ap­
plied to protection of our sea-bo&Td by
suitable fortifications, and the perfecting
of our naval defence by the construction
of powerful ships of war and submarine
torpedoes.
In the Post Office Department the con­
dition and outlook is most gratifying.
The Postal Telegraph is not considered
desirable.
The message afirms that the laws against
polygamy are not producing the desired
effect, and recommends that Congress
take the Government of Utah under its
own control.
Attention is called likewise to measures
inaugurated to settle the question of
Presidential succession, in case of the
death or disability of the President, and
recommends care in defining the exact
nature of such a disability.
He concludes with an appeal to Con­
gress to make some guarantee of equal
rights to all citizens, in place of the civil
rights bill lately declared unconstitutional
by the Supreme Court.
All in all, President Arthur's message
is a plain, straight-forward document, in
which he does not commit himself to
any*question likely to agitate the peace
and harmony of the administration party.
INCREASE OF CRIME.
That a high degree of civilization, where
schools and churches abound, and Chris­
tian benevolence blossoms on every hand
is not free from numerous scenes of dia­
bolical crime, is only too painfully mani­
fest in the criminal records of our coun­
try for the year.
Never before in all the history of jour­
nalism have its columns been so crowded
with the details of all that is fiendish and
horrible, and with the often frantfc and
ominous manner in which the public has
sought to avenge itself, as of late.
During the year 1882, the number of
murders reported by telegraph was 1,266.
Already the list for this year foots up
1,517. Another feature, suggestive and
reproachful, is the fact that the larger
proportions of punishment have come in
the shape of public retribution, but of 211
who have paid the penalty of crimes,
only 93 have been judicially executed.
Here is important matter for reflection
to both the philanthropist and law-maker.
THE marriage of E. A. Hendrickson, a
young lawyer of St. Paul, to Miss Annie
L. Ward, of Waseca, last Thursday even­
ing, was "the greatest social event in the
history of Waseca." Hon. W. G. Ward,
the father ef the bride, made her a pres­
ent of $15,000 government, railroad
and municipal bonds. Other presents
were made of the cash value of about
95,000.

AMERICA'S MILLIONAIRES.
Recently theWorld published the names
of two hundred millionaires living in
New York city, and it appears from let­
ters sent to the editor of the World after­
wards that many were left out of the list.
The city of Boston, according to the
Globe, can show up over one hundred of
these millionaires and you have no dif­
ficulty about hunting up many more of
them, beside decuple millionaires, and
quinquagintuple millionaires, in San
Francisco, St. Louis, Chicago, Philadel­
phia, Cinncinnati and other places. Be­
sides our long string of millionaires, we
have now here the centuple millionaire
and the bi-centuple millionaire, and per­
haps there is truth in the remark made
about the king of them all, that, "as soon
as he got to be a millionaire, he was seized
with a mad ambition to become a billion­
aire." If the 80 millions left by old Com­
modore Vanderbilt to his heirs 7 years ago
have since then swelled to 200 millions in
W. H. V.'s hands, it is easy to compute
how many years it will take, at the past
and present rate of increase, to raise his
spoils to 1,000 millions,or,in other words,
to make him a billionaire. To raise this
pile, he does not need to live as long as
his father lived. In a recent letter,
"Gath"savs: "William's fortune is at
least $200,000,000. He told some of his
friends about four years ago that his in­
come was $10,000,000 a year. "He has
never been beaten by any stock operator,
and has made every one of them who
tackled him squeal."
William H. Vanderbilt, says the World,
enjoys an income estimated at $15,000,000
a year. In April last, when he held $40,
200,000 in Government fours, his quarter­
ly check for interest upon them was
$402,000 so that his annual interest upon
that amount of Governments for the pres­
ent year is $1,608,000. The Woild says:
"Nobody knows exactly how rich he is,
because, unlike other kings, he does not
allow his subjects to scrutinize his civil
list. But he is a very rich and powerful
king. His fortune is estimated at $200,
000,000. In the years when he only builds
palaces and buys paintings and does
not buy Nickel-Plate roads, his yearly
civil list ranges from fourteen to twenty
millions of dollars. He buys fifty mil­
lions of 4 per cents, at a single invest­
ment. He controls over six thousand
miles of railroads. The area of his terri­
tory is very large. His subjects grumble
a great deal under the burdens he lays
upon them, but the only answer he makes
to their remonstrances is, 'My subjects be
damned.'"
In the Saratoga interview of last Au­
gust Mr. Yanderbilt's legal adviser, Mr.
Depew, said: "What is known as the
Vanderbilt system when completed will
be the greatest sytsem in the world, and
will reach the most productive agricultu­
ral, manufacturing and commercial terri­
tory in this country. It now consists of
the New York Central and Hudson River
Railroad, 450 miles and four tracks Lake
Shore, 550 miles, double track Canada
Southern and Michigan Central 550
miles, double track Northwestern
4,500 miles Nickel Plato, 550 miles
miles, or a full 6,000 miles of double
quadruple track not to speak of thous­
ands of miles of side tracks, etc.
In addition to his large interest
in each one of these roads, Mr. Van­
derbilt has blocks of Rock Island and
Burlington stock."
It is said no fortune was ever accumu­
lated by any individual in England equal
even to the present fortune of Mr. Van­
derbilt.
OHIO AND ALL.
The Oplnioo of an Old and Experienced
Political Editor Backed up by the Pres­
ident, Cabinet and Governors.
The B. & O. Red Book has become the
standard text-book on elections, and each
year grows in popular favor. That it is
deserved is evinced by the unflagging en­
terprise manifestsd in its preparation and
publication. The latest exhibition of a
determination to meet even the most ex­
acting demand is the issuing of the Ohio
election less than a month following the
election in that State. Ordinarily those
who are prone to studying the official
figures of a political contest have to wait
for months before receiving them in com­
prehensive form, and then do all the
comparative figuring themselves. Here
is the B. & O. Red Book for Ohio not on­
ly with the election results in every coun­
ty tabulated in the clearest manner, but
comparison with past results all figured
out and explanatory remarks which are
of the greatest interest. As a specimen
edition of the Red Book the contents are
worthy of note. The Presidential vote
by counties for 1876 and 1880, with ma­
jorities, losses and gains, total vote, etc.,
while the side-notes give a summary of
all the Presidential elections in the
United States since its admittance into
the Union.
The Congressional vote of 1878 and
1880, by counties and districts, with full
details of the changes made by the new
reappointment. The Gubernatorial vote
of 1883 compared with that of Secetary
of State 1882, majorities, gains, etc., and
side-notes covering all possible data as
regarding results. Comparative tables
showing Democratic vote for Governor,
for 1877 to 1883, showing gains and an in­
teresting study of the Democratic vote as
compared with the vote for the prohibi­
tion amendment. A similar comparable
table based upon the Republican vote for
Governor for the same year and compari­
son of the vote for the prohibition amend­
ment with the Republican vote for Gov­
ernor, 1883. Another most interesting
table is that devoted to a comparison of
the vote of both parties and the total
vote each year from 1880 to 1883, inclus­
ive this by counties and showing great
care in computation. Full roster oi the
United States Senate, Forty-Eighth Con
Sepresentatives,roster
ress, and full of the House of
Forty-Eight Congress,
arranged so that comparison can be made
with the full roster of the Forty-Seventh
Congress. List of Governors of States,
expiration of term, date of next election
in each State and of meeting of Legis­
lature.
Certainly a very cleverly constructed
book to contain all this, and it is by no
means a large one either. Very handy
as to size, beautifully printed upon fine
Baper
and a handsome cover, the .Red
look, as characteristic of all the B. & O.
publications, is exceedingly artistic and
attractive.
Of course it is an advertisement, else it
would not be sent free upon application
by letter or postal to C. K. Lord, Balti­
more, but so unobtrusive is the advertis­
ing matter and so valuable the mass of
information the book* contains, that it
would undoubtedly sell like hot cakes if
put upon the market. However, there is
no desire manifested to sell it all who
wish, get the Red Book by return mail
even with the postage paid upon it. The
remarkably complete make up and per­
fectly unbiassed presentation of the result
in Ohio may be taken as conclusive that
the Red Book for the coming presidential
year, will in its different editions, be' in
great demand. It is understood that sev­
eral new features in connection with the
information which will be so earnestly
sought after next year, are already in
course of preparation, and those who are
down on the mailing lists of the B. & O.
will certainly receive books worth keep-
f'he policy of the B. ft O. is to render
its advertising matter so valuable from
the information to which the largest por
tion of space is given, that the demand
for it will much more than compensate
for the largely increased expense in the
preparation and publication. Large sums
have been offered by outside concerns for
advertising space in the Red Book, but
no money can buy it. The publication is
beyond question the finest andmosteffec
tive issued by any railroad company, and
the B. & O. has no notion of decreasing
its value.
Hardly a newspaper office in the coun­
try that does not keep the different edi­
tions of the Red Book always at band for
reference, while to State Committees and
other political organizations it has become
indispensable. Praise has unstintedly
been bestowed upon it by Presidents
and candidates for the piesidency, Cabi­
net officers, Governors and other high
dignitaries, and it is indeed the popular
political text-book of the day.

uYes,"
she said, "our children are married
and sone, and my husband and I sit by our
winter Are much as we did before the little
ones came to widen the circle. Life is some­
thing like a spiral staircase, we are all the
time coming around over the spot we started
from, only one degree farther up the stairs."
"That is a pretty illustration," remarked
her friend, musingly, gazing into the glow­
ing coals which radiated a pleasant heat
from the many windowed stove. "You know
we cannot stop toiling up the hill though."
"Surely we cannot, and for myself I don't
find fault with that necessity provided the
advance in life is not attended with calamity
or suffering, for have had my share of that.
Not long since my health utterly broke down.
My system was full of malaria. My digestion
became thoroughly disordered and my nerves
were in a wretched state. I was languid, ate
little and that without enjoying it, and had
no strength or ambition to perform even my
light household duties. Medical treatment
failed to reach the seat of the trouble. The
disease, which seemed to be \veakness of all
the vital organs, progressed until I bad seve­
ral attacks which my physicians pronounced
to be acute congestion of the stomach. The
last of these was a desperate struggle and I
was given up to die. As the crisis had par­
tially passed, my husband heard of the mer­
its of Parker's Tonic as an invigorant in Just
such cases as mine. I took it and felt its
good effects at once. It appeared to per­
vade my body, as though the blessing of
new life had come to me. Taking no other
medicine I continued to improve, and am now
in better health than I have been for a long
time."

DON'T LIE!
The Royal Baking Powder Co. try to give the inference that their powder contains more
CREAM TARTAR, and that its LEAVENING POWER is greater than any other made, as
stated In their advertisement on the "Comparative Worth of Baking Powders," exhibited by
black lines. Our name was mentioned in connection with one of our cheaper brands, made
of different materials as the trade might demand. Our CREAM TARTAR brand of ANDREWS'
PEARL was omitted, evidently for a very good reason, judglngfrom the RELATIVE MERITS
of ANDREWS' "PEARL" and the Royal, as clearly demonstrated by the Government Chemist,
DR. PETER COLLIER, of the department of Agriculture, at Washington, from samples re­
ceived by him from dealers who furnished the samples from their stocks on hand in open

Dr. Collier's Analysis.
Government Chemist Collier's Analysis as to the Leavening Qualities.
No wonder the Royal Co. omitted Andrews' Pearl from their "Comparative List,"as
Government Chemist Collier's analysis shows conclusively two things: 1st, That Andrews
Pearl contains MORE CREAM TARTAR than the Royal, as shown by the cuts above, 2d,
That the LEAVENING POWER of Andrews' Pearl is GREATER than the Royal, as shown
by the two black lines above.
CHALLENGE.
Wo will give the Royal Co. or any one else $1,000 or $5,000 if they can prove by any lair
mutual test that Andrews' Pearl Baking Powder does, or ever did. contain alum or anyinju­
rious substances, and this challenge is open forever. Andrews Pearl Baking Powder is sus­
tained bv a testimonial as to its PURITY AND STRENGTH by the only genuine commis­
sioned Government chemist, such as the Royal Co. NEVER have published. TRY IT.
