The Editor and Publisher of the
New York Independent celebrated
the twenty-first anniversary of that
able and most commendable family
paper, on Thursday of last week.
We have repeatedly spoken in high
terms of this paper and quite a large
club comes to this place. Its , ad
mirers here, will doubtless increase.
Upper Sandusky, Dec. 7th, 18G9.
Mr. Editor : As your paper appears'
to be open for communications on all
subjects, I desire to say a few words as
to scnoois ana school arrangements
My object is to draw a picture of what
toon place in a town not a great wav
off, entirely freeing our town of any
thing of the kind, for it is well known
that our people, our school Board of
Education, our Superintendent, our
teachers, and our children are all right.
ana that there is not tne slightest jar
in the whole machinery. In this school
thafT desire to speak of such, incidents
as the following occur frequently :
jonn Jones reports rtutn sours as hav
ing pointed her finger at Bessa Myers.
and Bess in return having made a mouth
at Ruth. The teacher conceived the
offense on the part of Ruth as deserving
a severe reprimand, whereupon she
was sent to the Superintendent for
that- purpose. As to Bessa nothing
short of suspension during the balance
ot the term would atone lor her oflence,
Bessa's mother felt and talked that, as
tne casta oeut was witn itutn, her child
should not be deprived tt the right of
school tor so trifling an oflence, and
especially when provoked to it. Neigh
bors interceded in Jjessa s behalf. Su
perintendent when approached thought
it a very grave and serious matter of
making mouths m school, and thought
that nothing short of callinsr a meetinsr
oi me .tsoaru or Education would
answer in a case of so much magnitude.
Now it is generally supposed that the
wisdom ot tne town is concentrated in
tne "ijoara ot .Education" as it was
never known to thunder while that
august body was in session. The
Board" meets, the teacher Tnakes
statement of the case, firmly believes
what was told her by John as she ha
always known him to be a truthful boy
Superintendent argues the oroDrietv
of making an example of this case and
preventing a re-ocurrence, claims that
nothing short of a public acknowledff
mentof the wrong done, and apromise
to oo so no more on the part of Bessa to
the teacher, in the presence of the
Board, will suffice for the enormity of
me onense; ana runner, mat Bessa's
mother ought to be humiliated in some
way for the contempt she has shown
ior tne school, the teacher, the Superin
tendent and the "Board." The Board
after a fair investigation and due delib
eration, came to the conclusion that
Bessa's conduct was not to be tolerated
in a well regulated school : that in order
to preserve their dignity as men and
officers of the institution. Bessa shall
be required to do as suggested by the
Superintendent, and in future the
mother must do likewise, or the child
must remain suspended as per sen
tence ot the teacher. Don't let us fall
into the errors of a neighboring town

There were a number perfect in reci
tation but failed in deportment, and
they are trying to overcome that diffi
culty, and I hope by the next report to
have a number perfect in both. I haye
as yet had no cases in truancy and but
little tardiness, and this I hope to soon
overcome. The scholars take a great
interest in their studies, and the most
of them are improving rapiddly while
a few make but little improvement.
I haye had quite an addition made to
the school-room in the way of repaint
ing of the old blackboards and the in
troduction of new ones, which adds
much to the facility of recitation. And
the parents begin to take much more
interest in the school room than here
tofore.
