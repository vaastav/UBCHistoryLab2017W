THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Id our issue to-day will be found
President Roosevelt's first nit
ingress, Tl ? ol t<><?
long, nor i* il too short; it is ?n>t
about right, r'rora the viewpoint of
a Republican who is honest in his
l?e!i?-fs the document is not a l?a?l
state paper. Borne issues ha ?
discussed from the standpoint of
ultra Republicanism, while
bear the stamp <>f party conserva?
tism; all showing, nevertlieless.a dis?
regard ol politics and an honest iii
teiit. The President has sided with the
extreme protectionists and against
McKinley reciprocity. He recom?
mends a ship subsidy bill,and in thin.
no doubl greatly phases Senator
Hanna. Doth of these measure an
extreme ones and we had hoped that
Mr. Roosevelt held different views
upon them. He is rather tnilil than
otherwise upon trusts. On the other
ha ml the President speaks a good and
strong word for civil service and the
merit system in army and navy ; more
humane' treatment of the Indians;
freedom in time for the Filipinos,
and rigorous immigration laws. That
Mr. Roosevelt will seek to impress his
views upon Congress and the people
?K to be expected from one of such
atrOOg, vigorous personality a? he
-ses. Ami taken as a whole they
are not bad tenets; certainlytneyare
not dangerous to our institutions.
Thk sponsors for the ?|ua?lrennial sys?
tem clothed it?and we have never ?pies
tioned, honestly clothed it. as they
.'iit--in the attractive alignment M
??eoiiomy ? Richmond Dispatch.
The Dispatch very evidently doeH
not ?hare in the bsHsf that the secret
purpose of ?.juadrennial sessious was
to throw the elections of successors
to both Senators Daniel and Martin
into the same Legislature. This belief
?* entertained by many politicians,
though it is charily talked of.
