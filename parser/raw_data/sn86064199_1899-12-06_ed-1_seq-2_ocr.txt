THE MESSAGE.
There ifc something inspiring in the
thought that last night and this morn
in? millions of people have had for
their chief interest the message of the
president of the United States to con
gress. Through the medium of the
daily press the message of many thou
sand words was instantly communicat-
ted to the people in every city and
town of the United States. Every man
has read at least a part of it, and every
man has his opinion and is ready to
express it. Sometimes a disposition
becomes manifest among a certain
class of people to;belittle the office of
the chief executive. It is averred that
the prestige attaching to this posi
tion in the days when the republic
was young haB waned, and that with
the growth of our territory aod popu
lation there is leas dependence upon
the president for guidance. Such a
view is false. Americans are not less
independent than they used to be,
and there are a great many more kinds
of independence than ever before
But the presidential office has lost
none of its dignity. Bather it has
Grained as the popular vota has in
creased. And upon the opening of
congress the whole nation waits to
hear what the president haB to say.
His message is one of the very few doc
uments that are read by all the peo
ple and that tend tocryetallze the popu
lar thoaght.
solidly than it ever
history. So oareful has been
the admin ietration of the government
that tbe first five months of the fiscal
year show a surplus of 813,413,389,
with the probability that the amount
will reach $40,000,000 before next
July. So strong is the government's
position that it is buying back its
bonds, thereby saving interest. A
contrast, truly, to tbe conditions dur
ing the last democratic administration,
when bonds were being issued by the
hundred million to avert the calamity
that threatened, owing to democratic
incompetence.
The president of course realizes
that the vast increase in active indus
try, with its general employment oi
labor at high wages, makes neoessary
a larger volume of the circulating med
ium of exchange than has hitherto
sufficed. His statement of tbe situa
tion is clear, and his recommendations
are unequivocal. He takes the same
stand regarding the national banking
law as that held by all men of intel
ligence who have given the matter any
serious thought that the provisions of
the existing law have been outgrown,
and should be revised to meet present
Conditions. Adopting sutstantially the
terms of the caucus currenoy bill, be
urges greater latitude in Issuing national-bank
notes, and insists especial
ly on legislation that will permit tbe
establishment of national banks upon
825,000 capital In towns of two thou
sand inhabitants. The minimum limit
now is 850,000 capital. As the Herald
has always insisted, tbe main trouble
with the currenoy system is in the
laok of facilities for quick and
wide distribution. In the more
sparsely settled districts of the south
and west, particularly in the south,
there has been a growing demand for
backing accommodations, to facilitate
the proper distribution. of the loanable
capital of the country. The proposed
organization of national banks on small
capital, with all the safeguards pro
vided by the system, will make short
time loans very much easier to obtain,
thus assisting the harvesting and
movement of the crops.
But it Is upon the necessity for firm
ly establishing the gold standard, in
the laws as well as in the consistent
practice of the country, that the presi
dent speaks most deoidedly. He
urgently recommends that, to sup.
port the gold standard," and to main
tain the parity between the two
metals, the secretary of the treasury
be given ample power to sell bonds or
employ such other means as may be
necessary. The president urges that
the necessary action be taken now, not
waiting until conditions are less favor
able. He further recommends strong
ly that a trust fund for the redemption
of greenbacks be created by law, and
that greenbacks when once redeemed
shall be paid out again only in ex
change for gold. This recommenda
tion, if adopted, would effectually die-
pose of the "endless chain." Alto
gether, the firm tone of the president's
recommendations with regard to the
currency may be taken to indicate that
the republican party will at once en
deavor to carry out -its pledges to the
letter.
On the question of trusts the presi
dent takes a common sense view that
must impress itself upon a large part
of tbe people. Free from raoting or
fanaticism, the president's expression
decades, and build up that tranquil de
velopment or tne domestic state wnere
by alone can be realized the high pur
doso as proclaimed in the joint resolu
tlon adopted by the congress in April,
1898. bv which the U. S. dis
claimed any disposition or intention to
exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or
control over Cuba, except for the
pacification thereof, and asserted its
determination when that was accom
olished to leave the government and
control of tbe island to its people.
The pledge contained in this resolu
tlon is of the highest honorable obliga
tlon and must be sacredly kept.
I believe that substantial progress
has been made in this direction. All
the administrative measures adopted
In Cuba have aimed to fit it for a re
generated existence by enforcing the
supremacy of law and justice: by at pres
ent putting wherever practicable the
machinery of administration in tbe
hands of the-inhabitants: by institut
ing needed sanitiry reforms, by
spreading education, by fostering in
dustry and trade, and in short, by tak
ing every rational step to aid the
Cuban people to attain to that plane of
self-conscious respect and self reliant
unity whioh fits an enltohtaned com
munity for self government within its
own sphere, while eaabling it to fulfil
all outward obligations.
Thianation has assumed before the
world a great responsibility for the
future good government of Cuba. We
have- aocepted a trust the fulfilment
of which calls for the sternest integ
rity of purpose and the exercise of tbe
highest wisdom. The new Cuba yet to
arise from the ashes of the past must
need9 be bound to us by ties of singular
intlmaoy, and the strength of its endur
ing welfare is to be assured. Whether
these ties shall be organized or conven
tional, tbe destinies of Cubaare in some
rightful form and manner irrevocably
linked with our own, but bow and now
far is for the future to determine in
the ripeness of events. Whatever be
the outcome, we must see to it that free
Cuba be a reality, not an imperfeot
entity, not a hasty experiment bearing
within itself the element of failure
Our mission, to accomplish which
we took up the battle, is not to be ful
filled by turning adrift any loosely
framed commonwealth to face trie is
sues which too often attend weak states
whose natural wealth and abundant
resources are offset by the incon
gruites of their politioal organization
and tbe tendency of international rival
rlestosap their strength and dissipate
their energies. The greatest blessing
wblcb can come to Cuba is tbe restora
tion of her agricultural and industrial
prosperity, whioh will give employ
ment to idle men and re-establish the
pursuits of peace. This is her chief
need.
penses will be raised entirely among
Polish patriots throughout the world.
Tbe Polish Jew, wherever he be, is in
tensely interested in an j thing thatperj
tains to Poland or the Polish people.
One of the finest traits in the Polish
character is an ardent, fiery love for
everything Polish of Polish litera
ture, of the wild, stirring melodies of
Polish music, of the history of the at
tempts of the Poles to save their liber
ty, and of every phase of Polish gen
ius. The wild, sweet music of Chopin
is a part of tbe world's delight, and if
the Poles desire to have their honored
dead at rest in their native land, they
have the world's best wishes for their
success.

President McKinley is an Ideal pres
ident in one respect he recognizes
his status as an executive officer, and
does not endeavor to usurp the rights
and privileges of the legislative or ju
dicial branch. He is clear spoken in
recounting events and forceful in mak
ing recommendations, but he contin
ually acknowledges the power of con
gress and congress alone to make laws,
and the province of tbe judiciary to
interpret them. The president is
charged with the execution of the laws
to tbe best of his ability. No president
has ever been more scrupulous in thiB
respect than has Mr. McKinley. His
treatment of tbe Philippine question
is a good example of this. Further ref
erence will be made to the president's
recommendations.
It is a source of gratification to every
advocate of a sound and honest Scan
dal system that President McKinley
gave the position of greatest promin
ence to the financial question. To this
matter also he devoted more space
than to any other. President McKin
ley and his party are in perfect accord
upon this as upon all other great na
tional policies. Men of whatever be
lief on other subjects, who believe in
honest money, can stand by tha presi
dent on this matter, firm in the knowl
edge that he will do everything in his
yet indicates his full recognition of the
profound importance of the- subject.
There is no desire to evade the ques
tions at issue, but the president real
izes that the trusts are to be studied
and the situation must be met
in a careful and sure way
if good is to be accomplished and
that haphazard and ill coneidered
legislation will do more harm than can
easily be undone. Realizing tbe ex
treme difficulty of (reaching the oause
of unrest by means of federal legisla
tion alone, the president makes a de
finite recommendation that may be
adopted by tbe republican party and
by the whole country as indicating the
way out. This reoommendation con
sists, first, in a complete code of uni
form state legislation, carefully con
sidered and well within the bounds of
constitutionality; and, second, in feder
al legislation both supplementary and
unifying.
Of the president's recommendations
in connection with our foreign relations
it is unnecessary to &peak in detail.
The United States is at peace with ail
the world, and never before have her
supremacy in the western world and
her importance in the field of world
politics been so generally admitted.
Next to the currenoy it is our colonial
responsibilities that receive the most
careful treatment. Here particularly
the president refrains from overstep
ping the bounds of his constitutional
authority. The president's remarks
with regard to Cuba are so- striking
and ring so true to tha moat' exalted
statesmanship that they are here reprinted:
Tbe withdrawal of the authority of
Spain from tbe island of Cuba was ef
fected bf tbe first of January, and
tbe full re-establishment of peace found
the relinquished territory held
by tbe United States in
trust for the inhabitants, main
taining, under the direction of the
executive, such government and con-
As to the Philippines, the president
takes the only rational ground that
his duty is to quell insurrection in
United States territory, and that
congress must deal with the future of
the islands. The .president s state
ment is so concise and logical that , it
too is well worth reprinting:
The future government of the Phil
ippines rests with tbe congress of tbe
Unitsd States. Few graver respon
slbllities have ever been confided to
us. If we accept them in a spirit
worthy of our race and our traditions,
a great opportunity comes with them.
Tne inlands lie under the shelter of our
flag. They are ours by every title of
law and equity. They caocot be
abandoned. ' If we desert them we
leave them at once to anarchy, and fin
ally to barbarism: we nine them, a
golden apple of discord, among rival
powers, no one of which oould permit
another t3 seize them unquestioned
Their rich plains and valleys would be
the scene of er.dless strife and bloo-3-
shed. The advent of Dewey's fleet in
Manila bay, instead of being, as we
hope, the dawn of a new day of free
dom and progress, would have been
tbe beginning of an era of misery and
violence worse than any which has
darkened their unhappy past.
The suggestion has been made that
we could renounce our authority over
the islands, and giving them inde
pendence could retain a protectorate
over them. This proposition will not
b9 found, I am sure, worthy of your
serious attention. Such an arrange
ment would involve at the outset a
cruel breach of faith. It would place
the peaoeable loyal majority, who ask
nothing better than to acoept our au
thority, at the mercy of a minority of
armed insurgents. It would make us
responsible for the acts of the insur
gent leaders and give us no power to
control them. It would charge us
with th3 taBk of protecting them from
each other and defending them against
any foreien power with which they
chose to quarrel. In short, it would
take from the congress of the United
States the power of declaring war, and
vest that tremendous prerogative in
the Tagalo leader of the hour.
It does not seem desirable that I
should commend at this time a specific
form of government for these islands.
When peace shall be restored it will
be the duty of oongress to construct a
plan of government which shall estab
lish and maintain freedom and order
and peace in the Philippine?. The insur
rection is still existing and when it
termltates further information will be
required as to the actual condition of
affairs before inaugurating a perma
nent scheme of government.
Are the liberties kf woman teach
ers to be abbreviated? The superin
tendent of the public sohoolsof Kansas
City, Kan., has put short 6kirts, com
monly called golf skirts, under the
ban. Several of tbe teachers in one
of the ward schools donned the abbre
viated garment simultaneously and the
superintendent caught a glimpse of
the innovation. He forthwith sum
moned the principal, and instructed
him to inform tbe young women not to
appear again in tne school room in
short skirts. The superintendent's ac
tion Is bitterly resented by tbe teach
ers, and there is talk of an appeal be
ing taken to tbe board of education.
