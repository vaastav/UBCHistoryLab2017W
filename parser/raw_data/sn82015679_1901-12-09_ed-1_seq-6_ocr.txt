The train records show that there were
received and forwarded at Indianapolis in
the week ended Dec. 7 a total of 27,912 cars,
22.557 being loaded, against 20,5o7 In the
corresponding week of 1000 and against 21,-
12 in Of this increase the Pennsyl
vania lines showed 1,021, the Vandalia 538
and the Big Four 22, and in each case the
exhibits would have been more favorable
had the lines cars and power to handle
business awaiting shipment, the lack of
power being as serious a matter as the car
shortage. So steadily have locomjtlves
bt-en in use for many months that many of
them are frequently in the shops, and new
locomotives are not arriving in sufficient
numbers to offset the engines out of serv
ice; especially is this the case with the Big
Four and the Vandalia. While the grain
movement to the East Is light, shipments
of fruits, vegetables, dressed meats, pro
visions and four are heavy, which fully
offsets the light grain shipments. West
bound the tonnage of coal Is heavy beyond
precedent both of anthracite and bi
tuminous coals, the unprecedented busi
ness that the various industries are now
doing requiring more fuel than in years
past. In the natural gas territory the sup
ply of gas Is not sufficient to furnish the
mills with that fuel, and thi3 traffic bids
fair to be heavy for months to come, as
stocks of coal are considerably below the
average quantity in store at early winter.
Indianapolis lines are handling also large
shipments of live stock, it being shipped to
the markets, so high Is feed, and in mis
cellaneous freights the movement is heavy,
including lumber, hides, fertilizers, ma
chinery and all products of iron and steel.
In the natural gas belt territory the move
ment of products of the various industries
is large. All conditions . are favorable to
the railroad interests, and the demands of
shippers are for cars, the question of rates
seldom, being mentioned except to ascer
tain what they are on certain commodities.
The following table shows the number of
cars handled at this point for the week
ended Dec. 7 and for the corresponding
weeks of lyOO and 1S09:

linn a Limit Ileen Reached?
The item published in the Journal a few
days ago to the effect that the Pennsyl
vania Is now loading box cars with 110.000
pounds of grain at Chicago has caused con
siderable comment, and the question is
asked, has the carload limit yet been
reached? Twenty years have wrought a
wonderful change in transportation meth
ods. In the case mentioned several trains
were made up with cars loaded with 110,000
pounds of freight and careful records were
taken of the results, and it was demon
strated that thirty cars containing llO.OoO
pounds each can be as easily hauled as
with the usual amount of freight. The
modern car, with a capacity of 110,000
pounds, does not occupy any more space on
a siding than the car of 1896, when the first
expansion of the carload limit was under
taken, 60,000 pounds of freight being con
sidered the limit, but track and bridge con
ditions have been so improved on standard
lines that weight seems to cut little figure.
Engines weighing 200,000 pounds are con
sidered safe, and a car with 110,000 pounds
of freight does not trespass at all on the
limit of safety. The introduction of such
heavy cars and the heavy load will enable
the roads that use them to keep them at
home. The Pennsylvania realizes this, and
in anticipation has done all its work in the
most substantial manner. The Lake Shore
has done the same, and between Cleveland
and Buffalo some of the strongest and most
durable bridges in the world have been
built. It is thought hardly probable that
the Pennsylvania will allow these cars,
after they become well limbered up. to
carry more than 100,000 pounds of freight.
Another Coal Itoad for Indianapoll.
A surveying corps, said to be placed at
work by the Walsh party, owning the
Southern Indiana road, is in the field sur
veying a line from Jasonvllle to Indian
apolis. The new line will cross the Monon
at Cloverdale and build direct over a line
surveyed some years ago by parties who
contemplated building a coal road. The
statement has considerably disturbed the
Pennsylvania people. It Is stated, as if built
It will come into competition with the In
dianapolis & Vlncennes, and will reach the
best coal fields of Southwestern Indiana.
Exceeded All Records.
The Belt Road Company handled over the
Belt road last week 21,193 cars, for the
stockyards 2,073 carloads of live stock, and
for private switches on its line 1,616 loaded
cars, in the last two cases exceeding any
previous record in any one week of traffic.

for the elevation of its tracks in Wilming
ton. Del., th Pennsylvania Is enabled to

provements. Including a new station at
that point, the whole to cost S5.0oo.ou0.
Notwithstanding the large additions to
rolling stock of the Toledo. St. Iuls &
Western road since Iresldent Norton took
control, the company Is hhort of both cars
and ilncomotives, and is now doing the
largest business in the history of the road.
The Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern has

With the completion of the El Paso line
the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific will
have a route 222 miles shorter between Kan
sas City and El Paso than any other line,
and will save fifteen hours of time. The
latter fact Is largely due to the favorable
alignment and the grade of the new Rock
Island line.
Robert Kelley, general agent of the Wa
bash lines, has made an arrangement with
the Castle-square Opera Company to fur
nish a special train for three months for
the service of that company. The train

Buffalo on Dec. 22 for Chicago.
Charles M. Davis, recently appointed
commercial agent of the Toledo, St. Louis
& Western at Kansas City, assumed the
duties of the position on Thursday. Mr.
Davis's rise has been rapid. In March,
1S99, he was a stenographer In the office

the entire roadbed has been ballasted with
gravel and a system of general improve
ments carried on which places it among
the best roads crossing Indiana.

ing freight agent of the Santa Fe.
P. P. Sawyer, agent of the Pennsylvania
lines at this point, on Saturday received
a letter, written with a typewriter, inclos
ing $1. The writer simply said that he
owed the company that much. On the
same mail Andrew Wood, agent of the
Big Four lines at thi.s point, received a
letter inclosing $3, written in the same
manner, no signature being made in either
case.
It is stated that within a short time the
Toledo business of the Baltimore & Ohio
will be handled over the Pennsylvania.
The two roads connect at Tiffin, a distance
of forty-three miles from Toledo, and with
out inconveniencing the Toledo traffic of
the B. & O. will be handled over the Penn
sylvania. At present this business is
handled by the Wabash, the C, II. & D.
and the Hocking Valley almost exclusively.
That Indianapolis is one of the most im
portant points on the Pennsylvania line
is shown In the fact that daily there de
part from Indianapolis over the Indianap
olis lines thirty-three Pennsylvania trains;
this includes the Vandalia. Columbus
comes next, where thirty-one passenger
trains leave daily; Chicago next, with ten
passenger trains dally. In each case the
same number of passenger trains arrive
per day.
Ford Woods, assistant general freight
agent of the Big Four, and general freight

on Thursday, and being a warm personal
friend Mr. Wood arranged to be present
at the opening. Mr. Holliday takes with
him from the Big Four at St. Louis II. S.
Bradley, who has been with him ten years.
Good results are likely to come to In
dianapolis through the proposition to cut
off passes of traveling freight agents of
foreign lines, as' their lines must have the
heavy traffic which Indiana manufacturers
furnish, and they will locate their men at
this city and let them travel from this
point rather than come in hre every other
week or oftener. It is stated that two or
three of the Northwestern lines are mak
ing arrangements to open offices at In
dianapolis. ADAM'S WATCH DOG.
Ills Skelton Now Deiner Mounted nt the
Peubody Museum.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Dec. 8. Adam's
watch dog has been found. He Is in the
department of geology at tho Feabody
Museum, and dog fanciers are Invited to
call and look him over. All there Is to
him, however, Is his skeleton, but there
is a great deal of that. Not so much,
though, as there Is to his name. His name
is "Dromocyon Vorax." Professor Beech
er, curator of the department, Is putting
the skeleton together and fitting the miss
ing parts with artificial bones made of
plaster.
"Why did Adam name it Dromocyon
Vorax?" some one asked Professor Beech
er while he was stringing the vertebrae on
a wire preparatory to casting.
The professor looked his surprise and pity
at the questioner. "Why," he repeated.
"did you ask 'why?' Because It looked like
a dromocyon vcrax, to be sure. What
other reason could there have been? -"Why
didn't Adam call it a dog?"
"Because dogs had not been invented."
The dromocyon vorax, or "dromo," as
Eve probably called him. Is the ancestor of
our common dog. He is larger than the
canines that walk our streets and keep us
awake nights with their barking. This one
was found in 1S72 in the volcanic ashes of
Henrj-'s fork, Bridgcr basin, Arizona, by J
Hoisey. It came into the possession of
Professor Marsh and has lain very quietly
in the cellar of the museum ever ?ince.
They just laid him on the iloor and put his
name on top of him and he hasn t j-elped
once. Recently he was taken out for
mounting and with other specimens is be
ing put together.
SILENT P0HTICIANS.
They Are Democrats, and of the Va
riety Described ns 'Ornery,"
Starke County Republican.
A Jackson township farmer told me that
in the year which is nearing a close he
will clean up something like $2,500. Other
tillers of the soil have indicated that they
have done exceedingly well this year also.
and that when the year shall have been
rounded out they will have a snug sum of
money to their credit deposited with a
bank. The crops in this country this year
have been good, but good crops isn't all,
as farmers know. In other years crops
have been much greater than this. It's the
demand in the markets which makes the
husbandmen glad or sad. They are glad this
blessed year, for their labors are being
handsomely rewarded. .And. as we meander
down the pike, we don't hear much politics
on the breeze. These are the times when
politicians are silent awed into that silence
which backs them into a corner and shakes
its fist in their facts. By the term "poli
ticians" I mean simply ordinary ornery
Democratic, like Jimmie Fletcher and Sam
my tlorrell and Braddy CHazebrook. This
artful trio is wisely silent these blessed
days. They are not lifting up their voices
in support of the Declaration of Independ
ence and the Kansas City platform as they
did in days gone by. They dasnen't do it:
they simply dassen't. The people will not
stand for it. but would pursue them with
musty pumpkins and deceased cats if they
attempted such a performance. The coun
try is not at the mercy of the politician
these days; neither dare the politician pur
sue his usual avocation for fear of violence
at the hands of his countrymen. Twice
blessed are the American people, for the
politician is not only out of effvee. but he
has not the ground to stand upon to stir
up a breeze. As a matter of common de
cency, and in accordance with all laws re
specting sanitation, the Democratic party
ought to go out and bury itself. It looks
bad and smells a whole lot worse. Honest,
now, it does.

excess of the corresponding week in 1300,
which was an unusually good one in. the
volume of traffic. This year's trade would
have been largely In excess of last year's
but for the high range of prices, which, has
led to a curtailment In the use of the more
expensive articles that enter into general
consumption. On Commission row the fall
ing off in trade is most noticeable. Apples,
oranges, bananas and, in fact, fruits of all
kinds carry a high range of prices, al
though oranges are becoming more plenti
ful and cheaper. In the vegetable line high
prices are the feature, Irish potatoes head
ing the line. Leather is active with prices
hardening, but quotably the same f-s a
week ago. Staple groceries, coffees ex-cer'J-,
are very firm. The sugar market
carries an easier and unsettled tone, but
not so marked as to affect prices on West
ern markets In the dry goods line trade
was fairly active and prices firm, except
on American prints, which the manufac
turers show a disposition to unload at re
duced prices. The druggists are having a
big trade on holiday goods and in general
lines as well. Linseed oils have been re
duced twice during the week and closed
weak. Iron and steel are in strong position
at unchanged prices. Provisions are active
at the high range of prices which has .pre
vailed for some time, due to the high
figures at which hogs are selling. Flour is
in strong position as are all cfreallne prod
ucts. Eggs, poultry and choice butter are
very firm at quotations and are fast
movers. Coal is active at the advance of
the early part of the week.
The Indinnnpollfl drain Mnrket.
The wheat market continues active and
for oats there Is a strong demand at quo
tations, but corn is more quiet, an Impres
sion prevailing that prices on this cereal
have been sprung too rapidly to be herlthy
in character. The week closed with track
bids ruling as .follows as reported by- the

And sometimes even made

At rumtats pla.iitnrlal.
And ate enough to feed
Ten boarders at Memorial;
He often went on spr,.
And said, Hl Fturünij homuB,
