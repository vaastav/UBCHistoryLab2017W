My Dear Sir: 1 am much disap-
ointed that the Methodist and
riends of Trinity College in North
arolna have failed to respond to
y conditional offer of a year ago
add hlty thousand dollars to the
dowment of that institution,
oriiltd seventy-five thousand were
alsad from other sources for a like
puose. Kealizinsr the need or tne

ill be convenient to me the sum

permanent endowment of the

reafter enjoyed by men; other-
ise this offer shall be null and

I am very much pleased with the
f rise and progressive- manner in
Jrhich the College is now conducted.
Jfou have a most excellent faculty,
- .composed of strong, well equipped
"men of the highest moral and relig
Iious character; and too, this student

2nd. That we regard the free public
schools a necessity to the State and
we declare oureelves fully in sympa
thy with them. The schools are for
the people, and should be made eili
cient. We favor a sufficient tax to
operate them at least six or eight
months m the year, and we pledge
ourselves to do all in our power to de
velop a public sentiment that will se
cure this result.
3rd. That while we do not think it
the function of the State to teach re
lijfon in its colleges, and while wt
recognize the fact that there are many
citizens who do not wish to patronize
church colleges, and while we have no
disposition to exterminate or do injury
to State colleges, yet as citizens of
North Carolina, as well as members
of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
South, we do not believe that it is just
to the church to tax its members to
carry on an educational work to the
injury of the church colleges, or to
put the State colleges in unfair com
petition with the church colleges.
ne Deueve mac it is out
harmony with the principles of
our government, and morally
wrong for the State to undertake to
furnish free highereducation to the few
at the expense of the many, and there
fore that all free tuitions in the State
University, in so far as they are based
upon tne appropriation of public
monies, should be bdiscontinued.
That we request the legislature to
discontinue the appropriation of pub
lic money for free scholarships and
tuitions at the University.
4th. Knowing that the income from
tuitions is not sufficient to meet the
current expenses of a college or uni
versity, we are not opposed to appro
priations to the University, but we
think these appropriations should be
limited to such amounts as are neces
sary to meet the deficiency in current
expenses after tuitions have been col
lected from all students, except to
those to whom private scholarships
have been given.
5th. That as the aim of the State In
the establishment of the Normal and
Industrial College at Greensboro, X.
C , and the Agricultural and Mechan
ical College at Kaleigb, N. C, was to
provide technical and not higher lit
erary education, that we declare our
selves in sympathy with them as long
as they adhere to their original pur
pose, but we are opposed to any policy
that will in any way divert them from
this aim."

ference adjourned till Saturday.
Saturday.
J. R. Sawyer, chairman of the Sun
day school board, read a report recom
mending the appointment of a con
ference Sunday school secretary at a
salary of $900 and traveling expenses.
The report was adopted with the said
recommendation for secretary stricken
out.
The discussion of the resolutions on
State aid was resumed.
The debate opened with a strong
speech by L. L. Smith, of Gates, who
protected against bringing this ques
tion whicn nas become political into
the domain of the church. Presiding
Elders Hall and SwiBdell and Kev. A.
D. Betts spoke in like vein and their
speeches made a profound impression
upon all. Dr. Kilgo, Dr. xates, itev.
Oglesby spoke for the resolutions.
Rev. N. II. D. Wilson and Dr. Cyrus
Thompson were trying to get the floor
to speak in opposition to the resolu
tions when the friends oi tne resolu
tions pressed a motion to call the pre
vious question, thus cutting off all
further debate. As it was a viva voce
vote no one can tell accurately the pro
portion, but there is a very large min
ority that recorded itself against the
resolution. Severel preachers declar
ed the .paper presented was not the
extreme ground taken by tne bap
tists, but only against free scholarships.
The annual missionary meeting was
held tonight and interesting addresses
were delivered by Col. J. S. Carr and
Dr. Kilgo.
Monday
On the last day of the Conference
Rev. J. F. Cole, chairman of the oom

report recommending the adoption of

Waiusgto.v, D. C, Dec. J2tb,
1896. The opening of Congress l&st
week was devoid of any feature of
special interest. The President's
message was very long, heavy and
wearisome. The part of it relating
to the financial question was simply
a rehash of his former statements,
and keeping with his past nn-American
coarse on this question. Inter
est was specially attached to what
he might say on the Cuban question.
About this matter he had a great
deal to say, but whatever his real
meaning was it was effectually
buried beneath a mass of meaning
less words. He straddled the ques
tion just as the Chicago platform on
which he was elected straddled
the financial question. His position
towards Cuba seems to be about the
position of the international bime
tallist toward silver. The interna
tional bimetallist always claims that
he has a great sympathy for silver,
but says that we must wait until the
consent of England and other for
eign nations is gotten before we can
do anything. Cleveland expresses
great sympathy for Cuba, but he
must wait for Spain's consent before
he can do anything. Cleveland and
the international bimetalliat ar
f both arrant humbugs and contempt-
lDie irauas.
However, three strong resolutions
have already been introduced in
Congress, favoring the recognition
of the independence of Cuba out
right, and already speeches have
been made by Senators Call and
Cullom on these resolutions, and
other speeches are to follow.
It is a disgrace to our free
institutions and to our boasted
love of liberty that this na
tion sits still while the patriots in
Cuba who are contending against
the same evils that we fought
against the Revolutionary war, and
fighting for the same priceless boon
of liberty, are oppressed and butch
ered by the cruel and merciless
Spaniards.
On last Wednesday a Republican
senatorial caucus was held. Senators
Teller, Carnon, Dubois, Mantle, Squire,
and Pettigrew, who revolted against
McKinley asiU the Republican Na
tional platf. rui were invited to attend
this caucus, but th-y rnlitely and
unanimously dfcliin-u do so. Sen
ator Dubois, who was secretary of the
caucus sent in his resignation
as secretary and also as member
of the caucus. These men who have
80 long fought for financial reform
inside of the Republican party realize
that the monopolists, trusts, and gold
syndicates have complete charge of the
party, and that there is iio hope
for good government ever to be re
stored under or through it. There
fore, they have leU the party for good,
and in the future will stand with the
Peoples Party and no other true re
formers. John Sherman called what
was left of the Republican caucus to
gether, and the first thing they did
was to pass a resolution in favor of
international bimetallism, and ap
point a committee to go to work on
that line. How much longer does
Sherman and his allies think they can
fool the American people with such
straddling humbuggery and decep
tion. Every intelligent man in Amer
ica knows that England and the other
countries that profit by the gold '
standard will never agree to the free
coinage of silver. Therefore they
know, and these Republican Senators
know, that free silver with the consent
of England is absolutely impossible;
and, even if it were possible, what hu
mility and what trechery to our great
free government to claim that we can
not legislate about our own affairs
without the consent of Great Britian.
The man who claims that we must get
the consent of England before we
legislate would have refused to sign
the Declaration of Independence if be
had lived during the Revolutionary
War. He would haj said that he
could not sign the Declaration of In
dependence without the consent of
England. He would have wanted an
international Declaration of Inde
pendence. In the language of Zeb
Vance,these international bimetallists
would seem to be either knaves or
fools.
Senator Allen threw a bomb shell
into the Republican camp when he
moved a few days ago to take up the
Republican tariff bill and put it in
such a shape that it could be passed.
It is clear that the Republicans never
intended to pass this measure, and if
they are in earnest about wanting to
pass a revenue measure ana make up
otber pofott as the "McKinley Aid
Society," tby and tbeir friend ex
premaed great indignation. evert b
e, many held to the belief that wttea
Senator I'aJmrr voted on elect ioo day
the appropritne and Jortiee of the
appellation would be apparent. How
well founded was this belief wa in
dicated by a letter received hre by J.
R. Myrover from Mayor M. I". Wood
ruff, of Springfield. IIL Mr. Myrover
wrote to Mr. Woodruff and asked bin
bow many votes Gtoeral Palmer re
ceived in fata own precinct. The re
ply follows:
The returne show, a I am informed,
that the Palmer and Buckner electors
received no tote in Palmer's precinct
in Springfield. Palmer voted about 3
p. m.; alo his son at fame place. No
doubt they voted for McKinley.

JUDGE E.T. BQYKIN RESIGNS
Ks-3llcitrO. H. AlUa, t KJata. Ap
pelated a Hit 8ceMor.
Judge Ed ward T. Boy kin tendered
his resignation to Gov. Carr on De
cember 9th. It has been known for
some months, by a few of bis inti
mate friends, that it was his purpose
to leave the bench.
He was appointed judge in No
vember, 1SS5 by Gov- Scales, suc
ceeding Judge McKov. During his
career on the bench Judge Boykin
has presided twice in each district of
the State, save the Fifth, and in ev
ery county in the State, Eave one.
In many of the counties he has pre
sided several times. In Wake coun
ty alone he has held six terms of
court.
When appointed, Judge Boykin
was not ytt 30 years of age. When
he resigned, in point of service he
was the oldest Superior court judge
in the State.
He has rtsigned to return to the
active practice of the law. The
judge was heard yesterday to express
his deepest regrets that his interests
thus compelled him to sever his offi
cial relations with the bar and the
people of the State.
The term of office for which Judge
Boykin was elected will expire Jan
uary 1, 1899 His resignation takes
effect December 31.
O. H. Allen Appoixted.
On Thursday, December 10th,
Gov. Carr appointed ex Solicitor
O. H. Allen, ofKinston, to succeed
Judge Boykin as judge of the Sixth
Judicial district. The appointment
goes into effect on January 1st.
Mr. Allen is a native of Wake
county. He is a graduate of Trin
ity College and is 47 years of age.
POLITICAL POT-POURRI.
Condensed Mention of What People Ae
Sailog and What Farties Are Doing.
The vote for silver in the last
election," said Col. C. G. Bradshaw,
of Montana, "was the American
vote. The foreign vote, those fellows
who have been here only a year or
two, and don't even know how to
write their name in English, voted
for McKinley to a man. That's
where the big campaign fund we
hear so much about went, and the
result in the States having the lar
gest amount of foreign population
proves that most conclusively. All
this talk about the Bryan States hav
ing the greatest percentage of illit
eracy is the merest rot. Why the
census figures show that in Colorado,
Washington, Idaho, Montana, and
Nebraska the percentage of illiteracy
is less than in any of the New Eng
land States, New lorkor Pennsyl
vania." Washington Post.
Hanna and the Cstrtnet.
Canton, Ohio, Dec. 3. Chairman
Mark A. Hanna, of the Republican
National committee, has recently
been a yisitor at Msjor McKinley's
home.
Mr. Hanna spent a large portion
of two days in close consultation
with the President-elect. It is
stated positively by persons who are
in a position to know that he was
offered the treasury portfolio if he
will accept a position in the cabinet.
Mr. Hanna asked time to consider
the offer and it was granted.

Maseo, one of tbeir ablest and beet
General, bat ben killed.
There are conflicting report at to
bow tbie wat accomplished. One re
port is that the Spaniard invited him
to a conference under a flag of truce,
and that Maceo accepted the invita
tion, and was killed after be met (be
Spaniard. Another report, and the
latest one is that Maceo planned a suc
cessful trip into the lines or the Span
iards, and while pushing forward to
join a body of bis forces, was betrayed
by) his phjsician to the Spaniards,
who ambushed him and killed him.
Dispatches of the death are as fol
lows :
Maceo had planned a successful
crossing of the Trocha and by taking
the sea route with a body guard, be
was to join bis fore s east of Marirt.
This was accomplished in safety and
while standing alone be was shot down
by men in hiding who were awaiting
him. His body was then harked up
by assassins.
Comment is made that Maceo's phy
sician, Maximo Zeriucha, was allowed
to surrender and is now being treated
with distinction.
Bribery is charged and the price to
be paid for the assassination is said to
be 150,000.
New York, Dec. 12. The Cuban
Junta in this city received a telegram
from their Jacksonville agent, J. A.
Huau, this afternoon as follows :
Received letter from Havanna con
firming death of Maceo and staff by
combination between Marpuia
Ahumada, second in command to (Gen
eral Weyler, and Dr. Zerlucba. They
were murdered."
In addition to Maceo's death news
has been received that his entire staff,
tnirty-iour in number, was ambushed
and killed. Maceo's surgeon. Dr.
Zeriucha, is charged with having be
trayed the Cuban leader into the bands
of the Spaniards.lt is stated that Maceo
was on his way for conference with
the Spanish commander at the latter's
equest, looking to a peaceful ending;
of the insurrection. Th plot for his
assassination bad all been arranged
and on his arrival soldiers in hiding

RESOLUTIONS ON STATS AID.
( Friday was an interesting day. The
luestiou oi state am to m tuuersi-
(y was brought up by Dr. J. C. Kilgo,
vho offered the following preamble
and resolution
I Amonr the many vital questions
appealing to the enure n lor solution,
none is of greater importance than ed
ucation. The principles of our relig-
f ion inspire tbe largest intellectual aspi
rations as well as tbe greatest spiritual
(development. The church has, there
fore, always defended education, and
througb,the centuries, been tbe source
of our educational progress. Should
the church ceas? to be interested in
education, ignorance would multiply,
and all real educational progress would
be at an end.
But besides tbe history of tbe church
ia education, it is bound by the high
est interests of our individual and
social life to maintain an aggressive
educational policy. Infidelity has hid
itself in science and enthroned itself

W. L. Grissom, business manager, and
there were hearty amens at tbe con

constables out of nine, two county
commissioners, Register of Deeds,
Coroner and bett of all, the Rep
resentative, Hon. Jas. N. Price.
No truer man or Pop could
have been found in the State
He is in every way competent to
fill the bill with honor to "Old Un
ion" and to himself. We would be
pleased to see him elected Speaker,
but put him where you may and
"Jim" will make his mark.
The general talk now is as to who
will be United States Senator. Some
say Guthrie, some say Henry, and
some Judge Clark, others Col. Dock-
ery or "Uoidie" mtchard. ur
course we "Pops" would prefer
Maj. Guthrie or W. R. Henry as we
think they would best match Sena
tor Butler. We do not under any
circumstances want "Goldie Priteh-
ard returned. - We think if the Pop
ulist Representatives vote for him it
will be good-bye party. But we do
not anticipate that for we think a
Pop is too true to bi3 country to do
anything of the kind. Gentlemen
give us Maj. Guthrie or Mr. Henry if
you please-
We think every ciuaty should re
spond to our esteemed organ, The

It gives me pleasure to state that I
am well acquainted with Mr. Hill E.
King, who seeks the position of
Principal Clerk in the next Senate
of North Carolina, having known
him intimately for many years. He
has had experience iu legislation,
understands the duties of the posi
tion, and possesses first-rate clerical
qualifications. He has rendered
such service in three campaigns as
should commend him to favorable
consideration. In 1S92, 1894 and
189G, he has done very satisfactory
service, both as chairman of the
Populist executive committee of On
slow county, and as chairman of the
executive committee of the Third
Congressional district.

A Very Important Bftatas;.
Telegraphers' Advocate.
There is now pending before
Congress a bill providing for a Gov
ernment telegraph, which will come
up for further consideration at the
next session of Congress. This bill
owes its existence to the Interna
tional Typographical Union, which
for years has fought a valiant battle
for a national telegraph system.
This bill, if passed, will cause the
operation of a telegraph by the
government on a cost basis, and free
from the discrimination so frequent
ly practised by the Western Union
monopoly. The news, freed from
the grasp of this octopus (which
consults its own interests and not
the peoples' as to whether newspa
pers are needed in certain localities
or not, and acts accordingly), daily
newspapers will spring up like
magic all over the United States-
publications not tinged with the mo
nopolistic hue of the Western Union,
but papers that are free to advoeate
true reform measures without fear
of losing the necessary complement,
to their business, the news
The Postal telegraph is in the
platform of the Peoples Party. And
the bill now before Congress referred
to above was drawn and introduced
by Senator Butler of North Caro
