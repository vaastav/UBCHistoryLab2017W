Judge Houk has been interviewed
by a correspondent of the Washington
JRejmblican on the Presidential ques
tion. He gives it as his opinion that
a majority of Tennessee Republicans
are for Grant. As for himself, he says
he would prefer not to violate the tra
ditions of the country by electing even
General Grant to a third term. He
expresses himself favorable to John
(Sherman.
We had expected to be able to give
our readers the full text of the Presi
dent's message this morning, but for
some reason which we are unable to
explain, we failed to receive it. We
received on Saturday morning a tele
gram from the President's Private Sec
retary, staling that it had been for
warded by express. Bat it failed to
arrive, and we are enabled to give
only a synopsis of it.
The Decent Newspaper.
Boston Herald.
There is good reason to believe
that the clean newspaper is more
highly prized to-day than it was
four or five years ago. It is also
safe to predict that as people in all
ranks of life, who protect their own
at least from contamination, become
more conscious of the pernicious in
fluence of a certain class of jour
nals, called enterprising because
they are ambitious to serve updirty
scandals, they will be careful to see
that the journals they permit to be
read in the family circle are of the
class that never forget the proprie
ties of life. Already men and wo
men of refinement and healthy morals
have had their attention called to the
pernicious influence of bad litera
ture, and have made commendable
efforts to counteract the same by
causing sound literature to be pub
lished and sold at popular prices.
These efforts arc working a ilent
but sure revolution. The best au
thors are more generally read to
day than at any previous time. The
sickly sentimental story paper and
wild ranger and pirate story book
are steadily yielding the field to
worthier claimants. To the praise
of the decent newspaper, it may be
said that, where it has a place in
the family, and has been read for
years by young and old, it has de
veloped such a healthy tone and
such a discriminating taste that the
literature of the slum3 has no ad
mirers. Cleveland 0,, Nov. 30. The
extensive sewer-pipe works of
Sperry, Ritchie & Co., at Talmadge,

fourteenth and fifteenth amendments,
and lavs passed in pursuance thereof,
should, in good faith, be enforced rig
idly and impartially, in letter and
spirit, to the end, that the humb
lest citizen, without distinction of race
or color, should, under them,
receive full and equal protec
tion in person and property, and in politi
cal rights and privileges. By thee
constitutional amendments the South
ern States of the Union obtained a
large increase of political power in
Congress and in the E ectoral College,
aud tne country justly expected that
the elections would proceed, as to the
enfranchised race, upon the same cir
cumstances of legal and constitutional
freedom and protection which were
obtained in all tbe other States of the
Union. The friends of law and order
looked forward to the conduct uf these
elections as c tiering to the general
judgment of the country an important
opportunity to measure the degree in
which the right of suffrage could be
exercised by colored people, and
would be respected by their fellow-,
citizens, but a more general enjoyment
of the freedom of suit rage by the col
ored people, and a more just and gen
erous protection of that freedom
by communities, of which they form a
part, were generally anticipated than
the record of elections discloses. In
some of those States iu which colored
people have been unable to make their
opinions felt in elections, the result is
mainly due to influences not easily
measured or remedied dv legal protec
tion ; but in t -.e States of Louisiana
and South Carliim at large, and in
some particular Congressional Dis
tiicts outside of those States, tbe
records of elections seem to compel the
conclusion tbat the
BIGHTS OF COLORED VOTERS HAVE
BEEN OVERRIDDEN
and their participation in elections in
elections not permitted to be either
general or free. It will be for Con
gress for which these elections were
held, to make an examination into
their conduct as may be appointed to
determine the validity of claims of
members to their seats. In the mean
while it becomes the daty of theExecu-
tlve and Judicial Departments of the
Government, each in its province, to
inquire into and punish violations of
laws of the United States which have
occurred.
I can but repeat what I saiJ In this
connection in my last message, that
whatever authority rests with m9 to
this end, I shall not hesitate to put
forth, and I am unwilling to forgo a
renewed appeal to Legislatures,
courts, executive authorities and peo
ple of the States where these wrongs
have been perpetrated to give me their
assistance towards
BRINGING TO JUSTICE THE OF
FENDERS,
and preventing a repetition of euc
crimes. INo means wiium my power
will be spared to obtain full aud fair
investigation of the alleged crimes
aud to secure conviotion and just
punishment of the guilty. It is to be
observed that the principal appro
priations for the Department
of Justice at the lst session con
tained the following clause : And for
defraying expenses which maybe in
curred in the enforcement of the act
approved February SJkb, 1871, enti
tled "an act to amend an act approved
May 3Utn, IS7U, entitled an act to en
force the rights of citizens of the
United States to vote in the several
States of the Union and for other pur
poses," or any acts amendatory thereof
or supplementary thereto. It is the
opinion of the Attorney General that
the expenses or these proceedings will
largely exceed the amount which was
thus -provided, and I rely confi
dently upon Congress to make ade-
quate appropriatioa3 to enable the
Executive Department to enf-jrc? the
laws- tTi r
oxghessioxal electio-.
I respectfu"y urge upon your attenlion
that Congressional elections in every dis
trict, in a very important sense, are justly
a matter of political interest and concern,
throughout the whole country. Every
State, every political party, is entitled to
power which is conferred by legal and
constitutional suffrage. ' It is a right of
every citizen possessing tne quaiiHeauona
prescribed by law to cast one unintimidated
ballot, and to have his ballot honestly
counted; so long a3 the exercise of this
power and the enjoyment of this right are
common, and equal practically, as well
as formally, the submission to the results
of the sulirage will be accorded loyally
and cheerfully, and all departments of the
Governmont will feel that true power of
tho popular will thus expressed. 2s o
temporary or administrative interest of
the Governmont, however urgent or
weighty will ever displace tLe r.jui of our
people in defence of the primary rights of
citizenship. Uhey unders:ar..j tbat the
protection of liberty rtqaires its mainte-
nance in suffrage, and wiHeutam tho fall
autbority of, the Govpr.tTaent to enforce
laws which are framed to preserve thesu
inestimable richts. .Materia! progress nnd
welfare of States depend on tho protection
afforded to their citizens. There can be no
peace without such protection, no property
without peace, and the whole countrv is
deeply interested in the grow'.h and pros
perity of all its parts.
