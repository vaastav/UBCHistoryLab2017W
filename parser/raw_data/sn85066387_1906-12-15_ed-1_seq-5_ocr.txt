A FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD Nipponese lad of this city has sent a letter to
President Roosevelt in which he praises the school segregation plan, declar
ing that he cannot understand why the Japanese youth of San Francisco
will not attend the Oriental school.
President Roosevelt Gets
Ideas of Japanese Lad
School Segregation
Plan Praised in
Boy's Letter
Taking the opposite view of that en
•enained by every, other Japanese in
>':s.n Francisco, 14-year-old Frank
KobayasM of 2472 Bush street prom
ises to spring into international prom-
by a letter he has addressed to
President Roosevelt in defense, of the
FCgrc-gation of Asiatics in the public
schools.
Although Roope-velt has declared the
segregation to be "a wicked absurd
ity," Kobayashi says in his letter to
the executive doctrinaire and maker
of State epSjrrams that the Japanese
ivho "bject to it- and refuse to attend,
scho&T are wasting their valuable
time sitting idle and talking non
sense.
A controversy between the Boy-San
and the President might be a surer
means of solving the matter than dip
lomatic negotiation between Tokio and
"Washington. No one will attempt to
deny that either is gifted with re
freshing directness of expression. As
a sort of parallel declaration to that
of the President in his message that
"it is unthinkable that we should con
tinue a policy under which a given
locality may be allowed to commit a 1
crime against a friendly nation," Is
the avowal of the Boy-San that he
is "unable to understand why other
Japanese" do not attend the Oriental
public school, which "is as good as
any other public school in San Fran
cisco."
Young- Kobayashi has one advan
tage over the President. He has at
tended the Oriental school in this city
and cannot be justly accused of ex
pressing opinions and convictions on
conditions with .which he Is not thor
oughly familiar.
His letter, like the message of the
President, needs no explanatory foot
notes. Here it is in full:
Oriental Public School,
San Francisco, Dec. 10, 1906.
Sir — As I think it Is quite Interest
ing, I -would like to tell you my opin
ion about the Oriental public school
•which was built for the Oriental chil
dren here.
I was a member of the Hamilton
Grammar School until October 15. but,
complying 1 with the order of the Board
of Education. I was transferred to this
school, where I am now attending the
eighth grade, skipping one whole year,
and am going to the high school at the
beginning of the next term. I am the
only Japanese pupil who came to this
school and am enjoying my lessons
very much. I have been educated among
American children and am unable to
understand why other Japanese do not
come here. It Is as good as any other
public school In San Francisco. The
teachers give the «ame Instruction un
der the rules of the Board of Educa
tion.
The Japanese seem dissatisfied with
this school without knowing its worth.
Of course I myself did not know what
kind of school It was, but after attend
ing a few days I knew that this was
the best school- for Oriental*- children,
especially for Japanese who do not un
derstand very much English or are over
the limit of the school age..
There are several reasons why I say
this is the best school for them when
I think I am the only Japanese in San
Francisco who comes to the Oriental
school. --~.
In the few months since I came here
I have received 50 per cent more
knowledge than I had when I entered.
I can declare this to the public. lam
a pupil of . the graduating- class and
have knowledge enough to say this. •
I am very thankful to Mrs. Newhall
and Miss Greer, the principal and teach
er of the Oriental school, who have
taugrht me so kindly and 1 patiently,
yours very truly,
FRANK KOBAYASrxL .
Theodore Roosevelt. President.

prepared to admit over the demurrer
entered by the Standard Oil Company
to the Government indictments secured

which has been proceeding before the
Federal Court in Chicago this week.
Under the surface the Department of

fears the astuteness of the plea en

sires the Senate .to immediately pass
