Nevertheless it is a fact that under
I no administration have there been so
I many secret party caucuses and "be
hind door" meetings as under the Wil
|eon administration. While he doesn't
say so directly, he indirectly hints that
an investigation other than that of
the public kind suggested by Congress
I man Gardner, would not meet with his
disapproval.
If the president has his way, the
American public must remain in ignor
ance of its ability to protect itself
from invasion—that is unless it ac
pepts as facts the criticisms that are
lade in reports. Of course there are
iany people who would not be con
vinced one way or another by the re
fault of a public investigation!, but on
'the other hand there is a huge class
of fair minded, unprejudiced people
who are intimately concerned in the
•welfare and prosperity of this country
and who would like to be informed on
Whe matter. They may well wonder,
"what would be the harm in a public
lvestigation?"
IOWA'S HORSES AND LAND.
We, in Iowa have been hearing a lot
[about the great cotton crop of the
[south and the country has been asked
|to "buy a bale of cotton," the banks
of the country are asked to help fin
lance the cotton raisers of the south.
["Well, the value of the horses in Iowa
is greater than that of the total cot
ton crop of the United States. And
Lthis is a horseless age at that—most
pf the Iowa farmers driving around
Fwith auvomobiles.
The United States department of
rgriculturp has just made public an
other bit of statistics that is interest
ling. All of these farmers in Iowa
Iwho have left the state and gone to
[cheap lands in Texas and Canada, to
[one place or another have done so
because they anticipated a great in
crease in the value of the cheap farnj
lands and they could not see, where
Fin Iowa farm lands were going to in
crease very much in value. They
Lleft the state in order to make more
[money out of land speculation. The
njnited States department of agricul
ture now comes forward with the very
•interesting statement that the in
crease in the value of farm land in
[iowa has been greater during the last
Iten years than the increase in any
PROMISE OR APOLOGY?
In his address to congress, Presi
ient Wilson says:
'The road at last lies clear and' firm
^before business. It is a road, which
it can travel without fear or embar
rassment. It is the road to ungrudg
ld, unloaded success. In it every hon
est man, every man who believes that
the public interest is part of his own
interest, may walk with perfect con
fidence."

LET THE PUBLIC KNOW.
On another page of today's issue of
[The Courier will be found the abstract
of a report submitted to congress by
L. M. Garrison, secretary of war in
the president's official cabinet. This
report, like every other official com
munication that has been made upon
the subject, decried the state of un
preparedness of the United States to
'defend itself from attack by another
power of any consequence and calls
for an enlargement of the army and
navy. But this report will probably
draw the same comment from Presi
dent Wilson as have other expositions
'on the state of our national defenses.
The president, in his message to con
was opposed to enlargement of the
Sress on Tuesday, announced that he
army, afraid that such enlargement
might lead to militarism, and unalter
ably opposed to a public investigation
of the efficiency and sufficiency of the
state of the nation's defenses. He in
timated that he was fearful of the
light in which such an investigation
would be viewed by foreign govern
ments.
ileading between the lines of his
speech, one might get the idea that
(the president fears a public investiga
tion might bare to the world our mili
I tary
weakness. Yet it is hard to con
ceive that if we are weak, the foreign
nations with their clever systems of
espionage, do not know that fact with
out having to learn it through a public
investigation. By keeping it away
from the public, the only ones who
fare being deceived are the very ones
1 the most interested—the American
people. If we are weak, it won't do
any harm to admit it to the world if
we are not weak, it will add to our
prestige to let the other nations knew
about it
This antipathy of the president to
ward a public investigation is at vari
ance with all his pronouncements
along this line. Before he was elected
I he called upon the people to "break
I into your own white house" and see
for yourself what is going on there,
while since then he has oftimes pub
licly announced a desire to let the
public know what is being doi-e.
Btate in the union. Think it over. It census also showed that birds are
leans that wherever these Iowans
liave gone, whether it be north or
Isouth or east or west—they have
[been the losers by leaving Iowa.
There might be some question as to
rhether this is a promise or an
\W^'
\,
apology. In view of the disrupted
condition of the business of the coun
try it may well be considered both.
Legislation that was enacted and leg
islation that was threatened during the
laHt session of congress, scared the
lQnly scared theni but dW the^
injury. They will certainly be glad to
know that the administration has de
cided to let up on them for a time at
least.
EARLY SHOPPING.
For some years past the cry of
"shop early" has been rung in the
ears of Christmas buyers and while its
constant repetition may bore some,
nevertheless it is a good motto and
one that every one should adopt. Af
ter all the "shop early" cry is just say
ing in another way, "Don't put off till
tomorrow nflmt you can do today."
Practically everybody has more or
less shopping to do at this time of the
year and it has resulted in a holiday
rush upon the stores. Because there
are so many procrastinators in the
world, much of the shopping is put off
until the last minute and then the
buyers have hard work to find what
they want they meet with tired, in
different clerks and rapidly become
Christmas grouches. The way to avoid
worries, anxieties and cares, is to
make a start on it and gradually get
it out of the way so that there will oe
no need for a rush at the finish.
REAL ECONOMY.
of The Courier will be found the ab
stract of a report submitted to con
gress by W. C. Redfield, secretary of
commerce. The most striking feature
of this report is its explanation of
what true economy means. According
to the secretary, time economy does
not confine itself to totals of expendi
tures but to usefullness, and results
obtained from expenditures. In other
words, the secretary believes that the
American people are willing to pay
the money that is necessary to give
them what they want in the way of
government service and government
x-egulation. They do not look first to
the cost of a federal project, but to
the question of whether or not it will
prove worth the money. On the other
hand, says the secretary, they do ob
ject to paying out large sums from
which no commensurate benefit is
secured.
The secretary is right, though it
might be added that the totals will not
be so large as to cause protests, ii
there is no waste in the expenditures.
It is the wasted thousands of dollars
that run the totals up.
MACK'S ABSTAINERS.
A Davenport manufacturer, in
speaking before a meeting of high
school boys, told them that he had
heard that Manager Connie Mack of
the ex-world champion baseball team,
could put an entire team of total' ab
stainers in the field at any time he
wanted to. This statement drew an
expression of doubt from one of the
hearers and to assure himself that he
was correct, the manufacturer wrote
to Manager Mack and received the fol
lowing reply:
"In reply to your letter will say
that you were correct in making the
statement you did when addressing
the young men. I can at any time
put into the field a team of men who
do not touch liquor in any form, nor
do they know the taste of same, and
will further say that I Will have quite
a few men on the bench whose habits
are the same."
Regardless of the fact that the over
confident Athletics were defeated this
fall for the world's title, it is true
nevertheless that Connie Mack's team
of abstainers have been the sensation
of the baseball world for several years
back.
A MOVE FULL OF MERIT.
In flushing the streets in the busi
ness district to put them ip. better con
dition for Christmas shoppers, Com
missioner Bremhorst did a creditable
thing. There was a vast difference
between Main street on Tuesday morn
ing and Main street on Tuesday night.
With a fire hose, the commissioner
and his employes had swept the
muddy accumulations in the street
into the gutter and thence into the
drains. Instead of having to cross a
street an inch deep in mud as was tne
case in the morning, evening shoppers
could cross with dry soles and clean
shoes. It should be a recommendation
to out of town buyers that they can
come to Ottumwa and do their shop
ping even in this wet weather, with
out wading in mud.
President Wilson, in his annual
message, seems to scoff at the idea
that our national defenses are inade
quate. He holds the belief that a
desire for peace will preserve peace.
Apparently he does not recognize tne
fact that sometime there is occasion
for war whether a country wants it
or not. Possibly he has forgotten how
he, himself, nearly precipitated war
with Mexico by seizing the port of
Vera Cruz. And it is more than likely
that there would have been a war over
that very incident had it not been that
Dictator Huerta had his hands too full
at the time-in the futile effort to quell
the revolt of Villa and Carranza and
Zapata.
The persistent efforts to attract
birds produce results is indicated in
the bird census taken for the depart
ment of agriculture last summer. The
greatest number of birds to the acre
reported anywhere in the United
States is in a 30-acre tract in Mary
land, whose proprietor removed all
enemies of birds, such as cats, and
provided nesting places and food. The
many times more numerous in farm
lands than in unbroken timber.
Two Italian chemists have perfected
a process for depositing metals of any
character permanently upon almost
any insoluble surface by electricity,
zinc, lead and tin being used as easily
as silver, nickle or copper.
For cutting tops from bottles a-New
York man has patented a tool in which
several cutting wheels are mounted in
side a hinged frame, which may be
pressed r«gainst a bottle and revolved
until the glass is cut.

Washington, D. C., Dec. 10.—Exporta
tion of arms and other munitions and
supplies of war from the United States
to belligerent nations abroad must be
stopped: real neutrality toward all of
the warring nations must be observed:
the agitation for a greater armament
for defense "against Germany," or
"against Japan" must be talked down.
Such appears to be the prevailing
sentiment on both sides of the senate
and house at the opening of the* short
session of congress.
"I am not ready to bankrupt the
people ofy the United States In getting
ready for war when partial or complete
disarmament abroad is likely to come
of the present European conflict," says
Senator Cummins.
"Let us quit shamming neutrality,
and show Germany that we really are
granting no favors to her enemy," says
Rep. Vollmer of Davenport. "If we pro
long the war by furnishing supplies to
the allies, the end will come only in
general financial collapse, which will
seriously injure ourselves."
These views, given to The Courier by
the senior republican senator and the
most active democratic representative
from Iowa in congress, fairly represent
the sentiment of a great number in
hoth parties who have come back to
Washington to protest against bigger
expenditures for war. They reflect the
fear that we shall provoke foreign sus
picion by departing from our tradition
On another page in today's issue al policy at this time, and they voice
also the anxiety felt lest the shipment
of horses and Runs and ammunition to
England and France may cause end
less embarrassment in years to come.
"I am opposed to a larger navy," said
Rep. Prouty, with some emphasis, when
asked his position. "Wo have been an
independent nation more than a century
and a quarter. We have not had to flght
a defensive war in the past hundred
years. We never shall have to flght
one. The big nations did not attack us
when we were small, and they will not
now that we are big-. We have made
too little offensive war to provoke a de
fensive one now."
Rep. Towner of Iowa said that he
would support only a '"reasonable" pro
gram of military and naval appropria
tions. In this statement Representative
Kirkpatriek of Ottumwa heartily join
ed. The latter saw no need of doubling
the rate of naval construction.
The' opening day of the session saw
the introduction of Rep. Vollmer's res
olution to authorize the president to
forbid the exportation of all contra
band except fopdstuffs, as a means of
hastening th? end of the war and of
preserving neutrality. The same day
saw Sen. Hitchcock of Nebraska in
troduce his bill forbidding the exporta
tion of munitions of war, during times
of war, when such shipments might
the end of a year, will be rewarded by
the forestry association of the state
with the planting of fifty acres of
white pine.
One thing is sur^ about our coast
defenses. They cannot withstand the
attack of nature when the elements
go on a rampage.
Press Comment
New Orleans Picayune: When the
devoted Belgians are given oppor
tunity to restore and reorganize their
war torn country they might do well,
first of all, to remove it to a safer
and less exposed position on the map.
Burlington Hawk-Bye: People who
object to the election of ex-Speaker
Cannon to congress and Mr. Penrose
to the senate ought to go to Cannon's
district or Mr. Penrose's state to live
and vote. The residents of those sec
tions seem to have an idea they have
the right to vote for whom they
please.
La Crosse Tribune: Now that ev
erybody is well stocked with narrow
skirts, Dame Fashion bans them in fa
vor of the ampler garb. 'Tis a bit of
frivolity that well might have been
avoided until society had done its
duty to a war-famished world. There
is a helpful cynicism in the comment
of the husband whose better half
pointed out in the evening paper a
picture of a gown she intended to
purchase.
"It's out of style, my dear. That's
last-night's paper.
Eoston Herald: There are Bosto
nlans that, wishing to be infallibly
correct, pronounce Cracow Crack-off.
This seems to be unnecessary. The
word has been thoroughly anglicized
for many years. Nor is there any
need of pronouncing Berlin as if the
final syllable were spelled "een." It
is not necessary to speak of Wien or
Muenchen or Venevia or Livorno.
Prairie du Chien in good American
is Prairie doo Cheen, and the word
Des Moines, as pronounced by our fel
low countrymen, would be incompre
hensible to a Frenchman. The tough
est word we know is Rheims. Lin
guists inform us that it should be pro
nounced nearly as "ranc" in "rancid."
Davenport Times: The president
says that unless he has misinterpret
ed the temper of the American people
there is to be no large standing army,
nor even dependence on a reserve:
but the country will depend on a citi
zenry trained and familiarized with
the use of arms. This drilling and
learning to shoot should be encourag'
ed in every way possible, says the
president, but while he hints at some
sort of a national training system he
makes no suggestion that is specific.
With the restriction of hunting and
with laws guch as we have in Iowa
restricting the sale of firearms the
"citizenry familiar with the use of
arms" is becoming smaller each year.

OTTUMWA COURIER, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1914
reach a belligerent and be used against
a nation with whom the United States
was at peace. The senate called upon
Secretary of Commerce Redtteld to re
port on the mount of such munitions
shipped from this country to each one:
of the belligerents during each month
of the present struggle In Europe.
The only purely partisan blow struck
on the opening day by the democrats
In the senate was that delivered by|
Senator Lewis of Illinois In proposing
an Inquiry into the manner in which
the army and navy appropriations—
regular and emergency—during the
past eighteen years, had been expend
ed. As the country was under repub
lican administration during sixteen
years of that period, Lewis' design to
show tho republicans to blame for any
"unpreparedness" of the army and
navy was evident from the start.
Rep. Prouty introduced on Monday a
bill abolishing the famous "half-and
half taxation scheme for the District of
Columbia, whereby the district and the
federal government share equally the
cost of government and public im
provements In the district. His proposal
is that the district raise a tax of $1.50
on each $100 of real and personal prop
erty, including moneys and credits, and
that the federal government then make
up the balance necessary for the annual
budget. Ho calculates that this tax
would bring into the treasury between
$10,000,000 and $11,000,000 leaving $2,
000,000 to $3,000,000 to be supplied from
the national funds. At present the dis
trict pays only $1 on $100, and moneys
and credits are exempt.
"I am not a lame duck, nor am I,
standing around on one leg like a
goose," says Rep. Kirkpatriek of Ot-1
tumwa, in announcing his candidacy
for a return to the house in 1916. "II
have no side lines, no political frills, I
flounces or furbelows, and no bad:
taste In my mouth. I was almost born,)
bred and buttered In the sixth district
of Iowa, and I will be in the running
for congress in 1916."
Mr. Kirkpatriek adds that he be
lieves he would have been elected by
from 2,000 to 3,000 majority had he
been the democratic nominee in No
vember. As it was, he says, he had fig-.
ured out that the democratic candidate
would lose by 1700 votes, and the re
publican margin of victory was just
1710. He also guessed, before going,
home in October, that Senator Cum
mins would win by 40,000. He was only
2,000 out of the way.

Dinner
Storiej'
The wife of the great botanist
beamed at him across the supper
table.
"But these," she exclaimed, pointing
to the dish of mushrooms that had
been set before her, "are not all for
me, are they?"
"Yes, Mabel," he nodded. "I gath
ered them especially for you."
She beamed upon him gratefully.
What a dear old husband he,was! In
five minutes she demolished the lot.
At breakfast next morning he greet
ed her anxiously:
"Sleep all right?" he inquired.
"Splendidly," she smiled.
"Not sick at all—no pains?" he
pressed.
"Why, of course, not Archie," she
responded.
"Hurrah, then," he exclaimed. "I
have discovered another species of
mushroom that isn't poisonous."
As Herbert Corey tells it, he went
to a dinner once where Andrew Car
negie was a guest.
"After the eating was over, and the
speech-making had started," said
Corey, "Mr. Carnegie reached in his
pocket for something and pulled out
a handful of small change. A dime
got away from him and fell on the
floor, and at the first chance Mr.
Carnegie got down under the table
and looked for it."
"Did he find it?" asked one of the
audience to whom Corey was nar
rating the incident
"Did he find it?" echoed Corey.
"He found half a dollar!"
The Man from Mars: "What's that
crowd struggling over—an accident,
a flght, or some unusual attraction?"
The native: "Nothing of the kind.
They are trying to get to the window
to buy war stamps."
Whereupon the amazed Martian
made this entry in his notebook:
"The earthworms who are far re
moved from the scenes of fighting
are so engrossed in the war subject
that they even expend large sums of
money and endure great physical dis
comforts in order to secure copies of
cheap little pictures which for some
unexplained reason they call war
stamps."
In a certain town the local fore
caster of the weather was so often
wrong that his predictions became a
standing joke, to his no small annoy
ance, for he was very sensitive. At
length, in despair .of living down his
reputation, he asked headquarters to
transfer him to another station.
A brief correspondence ensued.
"Why," asked headquarters, "do
you wish to be transferred?"
"Because," the forecaster promptly
replied, "the climate doesn't agree
with me."
"Why don't you go to work?" ask
ed the farmer.
"Cause no one won't gimme none
in my line," replied the tramp. "I've
applied to several railroads, but they
won't have me."
"What's your line? Brakeman?"
"No I make tracks," said the
tramp, and then he made a few, with
the farmer a close second.
