We shall lay the President's Message before
our readers in an' Extra, as soon as received.
ieU-re-artce ef GattTeancnee.
We have official information that East
Tennessee is, at length, delivered from the
rebel reign of terror. Longstreet is in full
retreat Forrest's cavalry is following him on
the South, and Sherman's on the North.
The President has issued a Proclamation,
calling upon the people to assemble in their
places of worship, to thank Almighty God
for this special and signal deliverance.
Let the people respond. Let us urge the
clergymen and loyal people of Portage Coun
ty to give cordial and prompt heed to this re
quest of our good President. Crowd all of
the sanctuaries.
The ITI terious Army.
The King of France with forty thoosand men,
Marched np the hill, and then marched down again.
After all the flourish of trumpets, all the
reports of dashing movements, and of having
" outwitted Lee,' Gen. Meade has returned,
and closed the campaign for the present sea
sou, having lost over six hundred men, and
gained, positively nothing.
The Army of the. Potomac is a splendid
army, but poorly handled, and worse led. It
is good as a police regulation for Washington,
but as an efficient and successful battle-army,
its history is singularly barren. It will now
go into winter quarters, and Meade's head
will fall, into the basket and his successor
will probably carry his bead on his shoulders
until some time next Spring.
Th Escape ot John Morgan,
Bead the State Journal's account of this
even'. un the first page. It is the most dis
graceful and humiliating event of the war.
A base lack of vigilance on the part of the
Warden and bis guards, and such military of
ficers as may have had a responsibility in the
matter, may be safely charged, but it may al
so be said in addition, that treachery and cor
ruption, inside and out of the walls, had so
efficient agency in the work. It is to be
hoped a full investigation will be made, and
if the facts can be ascertained, let the crush
ing blow fall on the delinquent or delinquents.
The Columbus -Statesman says, the milita
ry surrounded the State House, and that that
building was thoroughly searched tb find John
Morgan. Who, about the Capitol, is suspect
ed of complicity with the escape? That there
has been knavery of the darkest hue, if the
facts ever come to light, will be fully shown.
Two of Morgan's associates in the escape
are reported to have been captured in Ken
tucky. The report that Morgan had reached
Toronto isialso 3aid to be false. That was
put forth as a blind, to aid Morgan in his es
cape. He was, doubtless, and may be yet,
secreted in Columbus; or he may be, by this
time, in Dixie.
Thanh itlTini Proclamation by the
President.
Executive Mansion,)
Washington, December 7,
Reliable information, having been received
that the insurgent force is retreating from
East Tennessee, rendering it probable thatthe
Union forces cannot hereafter be dislodged
from that important position, and esteeming
this to ha 'of high national consequence, I
recommend that all loyal people do', on re
ceipt of this information, assemble at their
places of worship and render espeeial homage
and gratitude to Almighty God for this great
advancement of the national cause.

Foreljpa Reoatsrnition, and How to
Prevent it.
In the present posture of affairs, the gen
eral impression is that there is no longer to
be indulged any apprehension of Foreign re
cognition. This feeling is streagthened by
the temper recently manifested by the Gov
ernments of England and France in the de
tention ot the rebel rams. Notwithstanding
this, the 'destruction of the Great Republic is
as ranch desired as ever by Monarchial Eu
rope, and any plausible pretext for recognition
would even yet be seized upon. The Lon
don Post says " that any serious reverse just
now to the Federal arms would leave neu
trals no alternative but to recognise the
South." On this topic of decisive recogni
tion on the part of European Governments,
the New York Independent; of Nov. 26tb,
properly suggests an important line of Con
gressional legislation. . It says:
"Now our business is, not to take, it for
granted that recognition and intervention are
impossible, but to act in such a way as to
make them so. And how is this to be done?
One way is to beat the rebels in the field and
by the sea-side. To defeat Bragg and Lee,
to take Charleston, Wilmington, Savannah,
Mobile and Richmond, would settle the ques
tion effectually. But we have it in our pow
er to distttfboiut the hopes of the secession
ists on btith sides the ocean, even if none of
these things should be done even if the 'se
rious revses' hoped for by the Post should
overtake us. And that is by putting our
selves,' nation, in a position to demand of
the Powers of Europe to refuse to recognize
any now power which declares its object of
separate exister.ee to be the porpetuation and
extension of s'.avery. As it is, we stand,
motally and diplomatically, at a disadvantage
on thjs matter as Ion;; as we recognize and
maintain slavery by law within the limits of
our own jurisdiction. It gives our enemies
abroad an occasion of branding us with incon
sistency and hypocrisy when we ask them, to
take a "higher stand as to slavery thari the one
we occupy ourselves., We are aware that this
ground is not capable of a logical defense, but
it is too plausible not to have great weight on
Dublic obinion. "Now" it is within the legal
capacity of Congross to take away forever the
reproach of tbe Proclamation that it abol
ish sfivrV where it could not reach it, and
left it alone where-it-MiV Let-Congress at
the ODeninz of its approaching session. enact,
as a war measure essential to the reduction of

Letter from IWcxlcss.
Acapulco, Mexico, Nov. 10th, 1863
Editor Democrat:
I am in receipt of the election returns of
Ohio, through the medium of the Democrat.
No wonder your rejoicings are abundant and
language latno in giving utterances to the rap
turous emotion of loyal hearts at such a glo
rious victory. But my astonishment reaches
a climax when I reflect that so many Copper
heads are found in Old Portage, voting for an
arch Traitor, that a noble and loyal General
had sent beyond our lines for a crime, and that,
the darkest and most cruel, known to Law.
I cannot account for so many voting the "trai
tor's tieket" in Old Deerfield only on the
ground that they belong to that class of vo
ters who are still voting for General Jackson
those who are laboring under the misappre
hension that the Democratic party is yet
alive, and giving law to the nation. Is there
no society organised with funds sufficient to
sustain a political Missionary "in the field
of the land and shadow of death ?"
But the loyal pyramid as it looms up in
towering grandeur must be very gratifying to
our patriotic President, who has borne the
burden of the civil department of the Gov
ernment, which heretofore absorbed all the
powers of former Presidents to conduct " ac
cording te law," at the same time conducting
a campaign against the great rebellitm that en
gages the attention of the world. It is a
source of satisfaction to know that the people
themselves, set a high value upon the Union
that they are determined that the rebellion
shall not overthrow the government, or di
vide a free nation in order to establish op
pression under the form of law.. I hope that
at the next Presidential election Portage
Coituty will roll up a majority for the Union
ticket of 2000 at least. Do not aim lower
than that. While our soldiers in front are ad
monished to aim low, those at home must aim
high, because they fight with bullets, and you
with ballots. E.

. Dear Sib : Enclosed please find $3,00 in
payment for arrearages on the Democrat, and
one year in advance, for which please send re
ceipt. We can haidly bear to part company with
the Democrat, yet we are not weaned from the
many pleasant associations of other days. Al
though engrossed by the cares of business,
and surrounded by new friends and associa
tions, we spend an hour pleasantly each week
in the perusal of the Democrat which comes
freighted with local items, personal and polit
ical, jremindiBg ns of many kind friends of
other days. We Ohioans felt like shouting,
on account ef the news of, your -election.
That yon had elected the arch traitor to still
" watch and wait," over the border, was glory
enough for one day. Now; once more "fill
up the ranks" and drive the last vestige of
rebellion into the gulf. Then right about
face, and drive copperheadism into the bor
der, and then for humanity and universal
freedom for all. Our faith is strong in a Prov
idence that never errey amtswo Cam - abide the
result in patience; although " Uncle Abe,"
sometimes seems slow for this fast age.

BEYOND THE LINES. By Rev. Capt. J.
J. Geer. Philadelphia : J. W.'Daugh
aday, 1308, Chestnut street, Publisher.
This is one of the most intensely interest
ing uarratives that the fortunes of the war fer
the Union has brought out. The author was
formerly Pastor of George Street Methodist
Protestant Church, Cincinnati, and.late As
sistant Adjutant-General on the Staff of Gen
eral Buckjand. Captain Geer was wounded
and captured at the great battle of Shiloh,
tried before several prominent rebel generals
for his life, among whom were Hardee, : Bragg,
and Beauregard, incarcerated in four jails,
four penitentiaries, and twelve military pris
ons ; escaped from Macon, Georgia, and trfc
eled barefoot through swamps and woodTdy
night, for two hundred aad fifty miles, was
fed by negroes in part, and subsisted for days
at a time on frogs, roots, and berries, and was
at last recaptured when within thirty-five
miles of our. gunboats on th.e Southern coast.
The particulars of the author's sufferings as
a chained culprit are told with a graphic
truthfulness that surpasses any fiction.
The work cnntains..a.fine steel portrait of
the author, besides numerous wood ongrav
ings illustrative of striking incidents of his
experience among the rebels. Every Union-

Obituary.
John Estv, died at Mantua, Nov. 15, 1863,
of Palsy, aged 71 years.
He was born at Phelpstown, Onrio Co.,
New York, 1793. Moved to Mantua, Por
tage County, in 1818, where he has resided
for the last 45 years. He was ever an affec
tionate father, a kind husband, and an exem
plary and useful citizen. He received a com
mission as 1st Lieut, in 1825, from Gov. Mor
row, and was commissioned Captain in the
1st Rifle Regiment in 1830, by Gov. Trimble.
How faithful he performed his part will be re
membered by those familiar with the military
affairs in Portage County, in those early days.
Asa temporary volunteer he had seen some
service in the war of 1812, and fully appre
ciated the importance of military discipline.
The" same patriotic feelings actuated him to
the hour of his death. He was a firm Dem
ocrat in early times, when democracy battled
for equality, and opposed monopolies. When
democracy was prostituted to the vile purpose
of extending human slavery, he was a reliable
Republican. From the commencement of
the present war he was a firm Union man.
No one sympathized more with our soldiers
than he, or expressed more abhorrence for
treason whether open or covert. With pecu
liar satisfaction he cast his last vote for
Brough, saying that he was voting for his
country, for posterity and not for himself.
His memory will be fondiy ci.erished by those
who knew him best.

THE HOME JOCltNAL KOlt 1864.
New Series New Peatttre New Type
On the second of January, this Journal
of Conversation Tones will commence an
other volume.
A continued success (which has been ex
ceedingly flattering to us during the trying
war,) enables us now to make a still further
display of enterprise, and to promise new
attractions.
The paper for the coming year will appear
in an entirely "new dress;" several fonts of
type having been ordered for this purpose.
H will cejjtinue to he printed on. the best of
white paper, its mechanical execution is
' still to be unsurpassed-, and pre-eminence of
clearness and legibility (so valuable to the
sight and so needful for a family paper) is to
be yet more marked.
With the January number will be com
menced the publication of an intensely inter
esting story translated from the French for
our columns, entitled, De Vdlvrede. This
work is carried to the full proportions of a
modern novel, and will occupy about lour
months in the publication. It win be suc
ceeded by several other Original and 1 hrill
ing Stories by our own narrative writer ;
while some of the ablest of contemporary
authors are engaged for us in translating from
the French and GcrmanT N. P. Willis will
continue to devote his exclusive industry to
the Journals editorial and literary resum
ing (as far as the illness of his partner will
permit.) those Sketches of Rural Life which;
nave proved so acceptable. Kosiding within
reach of the city, he will continue to prepare
his own more elaborate descriptions of mem
orable events ; to give extracts from his inter
esting persona! correspondence; and to con
tribute those portraitures of the peoplo of
mark, And of the immediate occurrences of
the tame, which have become, in a manner,
characteristic of his pen.
The Editors will still be assisted by able
contributors, foremost among whom will be
the scholarly and dainty essayist "mown to
our readers bv the signature of "F. C." We
take great pleasure in assuring to the Homr
Journal readers the continued assistance of a
writer always so felicitous !
A particular feature of the coming volume
will be the Foreign Newt and Correspondence,
by which our readers will be kept informed
more especially of the gayer "goings oti" f
society and fashion in the capitals of Eiuope.
Those popular departments of pur paper
known as Foreign Gossip, First Look at New
Books, aad the criticisms of Literature and
Art, are still to berctained. In the first of
these departments are included the news and
sputkling gossip of English and French news
paper literature. In the second, we make ex
tracts from the new books, duly as they ap
pear: while under the third head ("Litera
ture and Art") ate discussed the- interesting
topics of the Literary and Art World. In
short, the Home Journal for 1864 will con

number of contributors the selections from
tbe most interesting periodicals of the day

"And yet our brave bots must fall."
We have received the sad tidings of the
death of another of Freedom's best sons.
Marvin F. Webfci son of Mrs. Eliza Webb,
died in Hospital at Natchez, Nov. 15th, 1863,
aged 23 years. He enlisted two years ago
this month," in the 15th Ohio Battery, Capt.
Spear. He had been anxious for some time
to enlist, but had delayed on account of
his mother's feelings, and had taken a school
for the winter, but his heart went out to his
country. He left his school, and said to his
mother and friends, he must go ; be felt it a
duty. From tho time of bis enlistment, to
the day of his death, he was ever at the post
of duty and danger. Capt. Spear says of
him, that he was a patriot and a sincere Chris
tian ; that his comrades all loved him as a
brother ; that many a tear was shed over his
grave, for in all the laud no truer or braver
heart has ceased to beat. Thus another fami
ly are plunged in the deepest grief. His
mother says of- him, she cannot recollect of
an instance where she thought he ever did
a wrong action. "An earnest and sincere
Christian," says his Captain, "for his daily life
conduct made it made it manifest." He was
in a number of hard fought battles ; at
Hatchie River, he stood at his gun, and. with
his own hands rammed home 50 cartridges. At
Cold Water, when likely te be overpowered
by numbers, ancT his comrades began to leave,
young Webb stood by his gun and thus called
back others to his help and Baved his gun.
He was at the siege of Vicksburgh. At one
time, one of the bags of sand had fallen out
of the breast works, thus exposing them to
the fire of the enemy. The Captain asked if
any man in the Company would volunteer to
replace it. Here again he showed his brave
ry. He leaped over, in the face of the ene
my's gun, and replaced it. He was also at
the battle of Jackson, immediately after the
surrender of Vicksburg- His Lieut, was
home recently, and in a conversation with a
gentleman of Freedom, said, that Webb was
an exception to all soldiers he had ever saw.
He had never been known to utter an oath or
touch ardent spirits. He was taken in Sep
tember with chill fever, and was thus obliged
to go to the hospital. He had nearly recov
ered, but going to duty too soon, a relapse of
the chills, and diarreah ensued, which ended
in death.
Horse Diphtheria. A distemper has pre
vailed in this township, among horses, called
diphtheria. Henry Myers has lost a valuable
span, and others have horses and colts, sick
with tbe same complaint. Capt. Asahel Haw
ley barely saved a valuable two year old colt,
he had been offered two hundred dollars for.
The disease has now abated no new cases re
ported. Gov. Bradford of Maryland, after hearing
testimony from the objectors, has officially
proclaimed John A. J. Creswell, Edwin H.
Webster, Henry Winter Davis, Francis
Thomas, and Benjamin G. Harris, duly elect
ed Representatives of that State in the new
Congress. So vanishes the last hope of a
Copperhead tangle in the organization of the
House.
