Candidates for. office in Boston must
first satisfy the people of their physical
fitness. John T. Fitzgerald, once mayor
and hopeful to be again, passes high in
this respect. In a single evening (last
Monday), he attended ten different func
tions, including five dances, two rallies,
a society meeting, a whist party and a
banquet. We suppose that, in addition,
he kissed innumerable babies.
A DECENT CAME OF ITSELF.
After various contemporaries have in

revolutionary and is proved by the ef
forts of the contemporaries to set the
plan right in the minds of the public.
However, revolutionary as the innova
tion is, it is reasonable enough." There
is no more harm in a game of pool,
played under certain ; conditions, than
there is in base ball played under similar
conditions; and the game room of tht
Y. M. C. A. is just the place to furnish
the right conditions for playing it. The
game of pool, fundamentally, consists of
knocking fifteen balls into one, or all, of
six baskets attached to the leve playing
surface, using the end of a stick for a
. propeller. Of course, there are developed
features of the game, which are neither
so simple nor so commendable, but they
rre features which would scarcely find
a place in the Y. M. C. A. room.
AMUSEMENT NOTES.
"The Third Degree" Recommended to
Barre by Montpelicr.
"The Third Degree," which will be giv
en at -the Barre opera bouse this even
ing, was shown at Montpelier last night.
and this is what the Montpelicr Jour
nl says about it:
"The performance of 'The Third De
prce' at the Bknehsrd opera house last
eening was highly satisfactory; in fact,
it was pronounced by nil to be one of
the best, if not the best of the produc
tions which have appeared in this city
for the past two years.
The plot was strong and the char
acters seemed to catch the idea of the
author in every particular, portraying
bis thoughts and conceptions to a mitrk
ed degree. The heroine of the piece was
.Mrs. Howard jennes, jr., the part be
ing taken by Mis Marion Kerby, who
responded to inumerable curtain calls
throughout the course of the play. Her
acting was worthy of the highest corn
niendsition, and she had the house with
her at every stage of the performance.
The character of Richard Brewster, the
attorney who defended Howard Jeffries,
falsely accused of murder taken by
(Jeorge Sumner, Was also well portrayed
and be came in for a. largo share of
the applause which greeted the various
dramatic climaxes of the piece. The
other characters. Captain Clinton, of the
police force. Mrs, Howard Jeffries, sr.,
and Howard Jeffries, sr., were taken by
artists who knew well what was ex
pected of them and came fully up to
the expectations of the audience.
On the whole, the play is worthy of
the fiatronage of the theatre going pub
lic in every particular and should at
tract a large bouse in Barre, where the
company goes to-night,"

Tride goeth before a fall, according
to the proverb, but It often hnpjens
that tho fall does not take place as ex
pected by the cynical observer. Mrs.
Benedict, for example, was very proud
of her daughter's attainments ot school.
Mrs. Henedlct herself had had little
schooling, but attempted to make up
for it by retailing Margaret's triumphs
to her frleuds.
One day the minister's wife was call

Paris Student Restaurants.
Student restaurants in Pari are an
Institution tbut Americans may well
envy. They are run solely for the ben
efit of the students, although strangers
are welcome. There are certain little
formalities that must be observed.
For instance. It Is the duty of every
cue entering to bow to the uaadame
and say, "Boujour, madame," or "Bon
soir, madame." according to the time
of day. After oue has finished his
meal he asks for the "additlone." as
the bill Is called. When it Is presented
by the trim little waitress It Is con
sidered only proper to say. "Mercl,
mademoiselle." lie then leaves a tip
of 10 centimes, or 2 cents, and, again
bowlug to the madame and saying
"Bimjour" or "BoiiKoir." he Is at liber
ty to leave. The highest priced article
on the bill of fare Is 75 centimes, or
15 cents, and this In all students res

merit in any degree suited to my tastes
and aptitude?" These are simple ques
tions, and yet upon their unswer often
depends the possibility of nervous
health or nervous disease. If the suf
ferer discovers that any of the phys
ical causes of a nervous breakdown
ore In operation It Is obvious that It Is
his first duty to fifcht against these
causes, to lessen them and If possible
to remove thero altogether. In the
nest place and this is especially to be
noted by nervous women one of the
essential conditions of nervous bal
ance is the control of the emotions.
The tendency on the slightest provoca
tion to give way to a paroxysm of
tears Is dangerous, because It leads to
weakness, bodily and mental. No
doubt there are moments of poignant
agony when tears are nature's benefi
cial provision for some relief to an
overstrained nervous and mental or
ganism, but these moments come at
rare Intervals in our lives, and, as a
rule, so far from weakening our men
tal or moral life, they uplift and purify
It. What nervous people must be
warned against Is the tendency to let
themselves go because of some petty
worry or some slight domestic differ
ence or through some morbid Impulse

TAFT'S COMMONPLACE MESSAGE.
The newspapers which, expected pyro
technics and the unusual in the presi
dent's annual message were greatly dis
appointed, for there was neither a dis
play of fireworks nor a departure from !
the ordinary run of messages from th
executive to the legislative branch of
the United States government. And one
ought really to expect nothing else. A
president's message is, or should be, a
resume of the events during the period
covered by it, a summary of the acts and
failures and some calm lecommendations
for making up for the failures and for
meeting new conditions. Inasmuch as
President Taft's message, delivered yes
terday afternoon, did that, it should be
considered as satisfactory, even if it did
not flaggellate, someone to an inch of
his reputation or declare war against
an offending nation. In fact .it (the
message) bears out the opinion concern
ing the nation's present executive, that
he is one of the steady-moving,. every
day sort of officials and, as such, ealcn.
lated to weigh matters thoroughly be
fore he commits- himself. In other
words, toe Is safe and sane.

is a green colored powder, packed in tin cans rea

handfuls, according to the dust. Sprinkle where
you are to begin (not all over the carpet), then
sweep as you always do. The powder is swept
ahead of the broom and falling on the carpets ab
sorbs the dust - leaving the carpet clean and bright.
The dust is not thrown into the air to settle back
on the carpet and furniture.
DUSTBANE should be used in sweeping
