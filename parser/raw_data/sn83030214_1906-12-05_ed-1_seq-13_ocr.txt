MESSAGE.
To the Senate ■,:,/ Uoute of Representatives: .
As a nation we still continue to enjoy a liter
*jj« unprecfMtaited prosperity, and It Is probable
that only Kdden epeculatlon and dipr.gar>i of
Ucitlmate businfss methods on th«» part of the
business world can materially mar this pros
perity .
* Vo'Congrws In our time has <i<>ni> mate good
work of Importance than the present Congresc.
Th^rr w«f« Pev«Bl matters left unfinished at
T ,-, ,. last session, however, which l most ear
riectly hope you will complete before your ad
joiirnTTvnt.
I npnin roeommenrl a law prohibiting; all cor
j,omii"t« from contributing to tho campaign

passed one House of Con-
Corpcration Cam- Rr»-fs. Let individuals

p but lei us prohibit in >■{-
♦rptive fashion all corporations from making
contributiona f<T any political purpose, directly
or indirectly.
A!i"tl' f r bill which has just passed one House
jf'jlu- «"' i n;rre«s, and which it Is urgently nei-«-s
fSr\' should be enacted into law. is that con
ferring upon the govern
3overnmer.t's Right mer.t the ripht of appeal
of Appeal in In criminal cases on ques-
Crimina! Cases. tiojis of law. This right
exists in many of the
Ft£trs; it exists in the District of Columbia by
get of the Congress. It Is. of course, not pro
}ief=ed that i» any case a verdict for the de
fendant on the merits should be set aside. Re
c^r.tly In one district where the government had
Indicted certain persons for conspiracy in con
nection with r» --bates the court sustained the de
fendant's demurrer, while In another Jurisdic
tion an Indictment for conspiracy to obtain re
lates hns nrrn sustained by the court, convic
tfem obtained under it and two defendants sen
tencd to Imprisonment. The two cases referred
to may not be in real conilict with each other.
but it Is unfortunate thnt there should even be
rd apparent conflict. At present there Is no way
by which the government can cause such a
conflict, when 1t occurs, to be solved by an ap
jep.l to a higher court, and the wheels of jus
tire nr<» blocked without any real decision of the
<ju«»stior. I cannot too strongly urge the pass
aaje of the bill In question. a failure to pass it
Miil result in seriously hampering the povern-
Bwnt in its effort to obtain Justice, especially
egainst wealthy Individuals or corporations who
do Krone. an<l may also prevent the govern
ment from obtaining Justice for wageworkers
who are r.ot themselves able effectively to con
tat a case where the Judßinent of an Inferior
court lias been against them. I have specifically
la view ■ recent decision by a, district judsre
aaiilia. railway employes without remedy for
violation of a certain so-called labor statute. It
F<*ns an absurdity to permit a single district
judge, against what may be the judgment of the
Immense majority of Ms colleagues on the
teach, to declare a law solemnly enacted by the
Congress to be "unconstitutional." and then to
<seny to the rovernment the right to have the
Supreme Court definitely decide the question.
It is well •.. recollect that the real efficiency
cf the law often depends not upon the passage
of aits as to which there is great public ex
citement, but upon the passage of acts of this
nature as t.> which there is not much public ex
citement, because there is little public under

of defeating them. The Importance of enacting

facreuaed by the fact that the government has

~l X «ir£^ amounting In the aggregate to the sum
of 1108.6* and Judgment to that effect will be en
tered In this case.
In connection with this matter. I would like to
call attention to the very unsatisfactory state of
our criminal law, resulting In large part from
_ ... .. , the habit of setting aside
betting Aside the Judgments of inferior
of Judgments and courts on technicalities ab-
Granting or soiuteiy unconnected with
New Trials. the merits of the case, and
where there is no attempt
to show that there has been any failure of sub
stantial justice. It would be well to enact a law
providing something to the effect that:
No Judgment shall be set aside or new trial
granted in any cause, civil or criminal, on the
ground of misdirection of the jury or the im
proper admission or rejection of evidence, or
for error as to any matter of pleading or pro
cedure unless. In the opinion of the court to
which the application is made, aft. an exam
ination of the entire cause, it shall affirmatively
appear that the error complained of has resulted
In a miscarriage of Justice.
In my last message I suggested the enactment
of a law in connection with the issuance of in
junctions, attention having been sharply drawn
... to the matter by the demand
Injunctions. that the right of applying
injunctions In labor cases
should be wholly abolished. It is at least doubt
ful whether a law abolishing altogether the use
of Injunctions in such cases would stand the
test of th« courts; in which case, of course, the
legislation would be ineffective. Moreover. I
believe it would be wrong altogether to prohibit
trie use of Injunctions. It Is criminal to permit
sympathy for criminals to weaken our hands in
upholding the law; and if men seek to destroy
life or property by mob violence there should be
no impairment of the power of the courts to deal
with them In the most summary and effective
way possible. But so far as possible the abuse
of the power should be provided against by some
such law as I advocated last year.
In this matter of Injunctions there Is lodged
In the hands of the Judiciary a necessary power
which is nevertheless subject to the possibility
of grave abuse. It is a power that should be
exercised with extreme care, and should be sub
ject to the Jealous scrutiny of all men, and
condemnation should be meted out as much to
the judge who fails to use it boldly when neces
sary as to the Judge who uses it wantonly or op
pressively. Of course ■ judge strong enough
to be Jit for his office will enjoin any resort to
violence or Intimidation, especially by con
spiracy, no matter what his opinion may be of
the rights of the original quarrel. There must
be no hesitation in dealing with disorder. Hut
there must likewise be no such abuse of the in
junctive power as is implied In forbidding labor-
Ing men to strive for their own betterment in
peaceful and lawful ways; nor must the Injunc
tion be used merely to aid some big corpora
tion in carrying out schemes for its own aggran
dizement. It must be remembered that a pre
liminary injunction in a labor case, if granted
without adequate proof (even when authority
can be found to support the conclusions of law
on which It is founded), may often settle tho
dispute between the parties; and therefore if
improperly granted may do irreparable wrong".
Yet there are many judges who assume a
matter-of-course granting of a preliminary In
junction to be the ordinary and proper Judicial
disposition of such cases; and there have un
doubtedly been flagrant wrongs committed by
Judges in connection with labor disputes even
within the last few years, although I think
much less often than In former years. Such
Judges by their unwise action Immensely
strengthen the hands of those who are striving
entirely to do away with the power of Injunc
tion; and therefore such careless use of the in-
Junctive process tends to threaten its very ex
istence, for if the American people ever become
convinced that this process Is habitually abused,
whether in matters affecting labor or in matters
affecting corporations. It will be well-nigh im
possible to prevent Its abolition.
It may be the highest duty of a Judge at nny
given moment to disregard, not merely the
wishes of Individuals of great political or finan
cial power, but the overwhelming tide of public
sentiment; and the Judge who does thus dis
regard public sentiment when it is wrong, who
brushes aside the plea of any special Interest
when the pleading is not founded on righteous
ness, performs the highest service to the coun
try. Such a Judge is deserving of all honor;
and all honor cannot be paid to this wise and
fearless judge if we permit the growth of an
absurd convention which would forbid any crit
icism of the judge of another type, who shows
himself timid In the presence of arrogant dis
order, or who on Insufficient grounds grants an
Injunction that does grave injustice, or who in
his capacity m a construer. and therefore in
part a maker, of the law. in flagrant fashion
thwarts the cause of decent government The
Judge has a power over which no review can
be exercised: he himself sits in review upon the
acts of both the executive and legislative
branches of the Government; save In the most
extraordinary raves be is amenable only at the
bar of public opinion; and it Is unwise to main
tain that public opinion in reference to a man
with such power shall neither bo expressed
nor led.
The best Judges have ever been foremost to
disclaim any Immunity from criticism. This has
been true »i i< ••- the days of the great English
Lord Chancellor Parker, who paid: "Let all
people be at liberty to know what I found my
Judgment upon; that, so when I have given it
in any cause, others may be at liberty to judge,
of in**." The proprieties of the case were set
forth with singular clearness and good temper
by Judge w. IT. Taft, when a United States
circuit Judge, eleven years ago. in 1895:
The opportunity lieriv and publicly to criticise
Judicial action Ik of vastly mor«i lui|>ortance to the
body politic than the immunity of ..nuts and
<udgfs from unjust appertains and attack Noth
ing '....is more to render |uds< ■ careful In their

tice than the consciousness that every act of theirs
Is to be iUbJectsd to th« Intelligent scrutiny and

as It often is. by a direct attack upon the Judicial
fairness and motive* of the occupants Of the
bench: for If the law. is but the mmm of com
mon sense, the protest of many average men ma
evidence a defect in a judicial conclusion .though
based on the nicest legal reasoning and P r ° fol "™~
est learning. The two Important elements of moral
character In a Judge are an earnest desire to reach
a Just conclusion and courage to enforce it. In so
far as fear of public comment does not affect the
courage of a Judge, but only spurs him on to
search Ills conscience and to reach the result
which approves itself to his Inmost heart, BUCn
comment serves a useful purpose. There are few
men. whether they are judges for life or for a
shorter term, who do not prefer to earn and hold
the respect of all. and who cannot be reached
and made to pause and deliberate by hostile pub
lic criticism. In the case of judges having a lift

right freely to comment on their decisions or
greater Importance, becauso it !s the only prac
tical and available Instrument In the hands of a
free people to keep such Judges alive to the rea
sonable demands of those they serve.
On the other hand, the danger of destroying the
proper influence of Judicial decisions by creating
unfounded prejudices against the courts Justifies
and requires that unjust attacks shall be met.
and answered. Courts must ultimately rest their
defence upon the inherent strength of the opin
ions they deliver as the ground for their con
clusions, and must trust to the calm and delib
erate judgment of all the people as their best vin
dication. --• ■;■"-■ . ■"* -;.
There is on© consideration which should bo
taken into account by the good people who carry
a sound proposition to an excess In objecting to
any criticism of a judge's decision. The instinct
of the American people as a whole is sound in
this matter. They will not subscribe to tlio
doctrine that any public servant is to be above
all criticism. If the best citizens, those most
competent to express their Judgment In such
matters, and. above all. those belonging to the
great and honorable profession of the bar. co
profoundly influential in American life, take the
position that there shall be no criticism of a
judge under any circumstances, their view will
not bo accepted by the American people as a
whole. In such event the people will turn to.
and tend to accept as justifiable, the intemperate
and Improper criticism uttered by unworthy
agitators. Surely, it is a misfortune to leave to
such critics a function, right in itself, which
they are certain to abuse. Just and temperate
criticism, when necessary, is a safeguard against
the acceptance by the people as a whole of that
intemperate antagonism toward the judiciary
which must be combated by every right think
ing man. and which, if it became widespread
among the people at large, would constitute a
dire menace to the Republic.
In connection with the delays of the law. I
call your attention and the attention of the na
tion to the prevalence of crime among us, and
above all to the epidemic of
Lynching. lynching and mob violence
that springs up. now in one
part of our country, now in another. Each sec
tion. North, South, Bast or West, has its own
faults: no section can with wisdom spend it*
time jeering at the faults of another section; it
should be busy trying to amend its own short
comings. To deal with the crime of corruption
it is necessary to have an awakened public con
science, and to supplement this by whatever
legislation will add speed and certainty In the
execution of the law. When we deal with lynch
ing even more is necessary. A great many white
men are lynched, but the crime is peculiarly fre
quent in respect to black men. The greatest ex
isting cause of lynching is the perpetration, es
pecially by black men, of the hideous crime of
rape— the most abominable in all the category
of crimes, even worse than murder. Mobs fre
quently avenge the commission of this crime by
themselves torturing to death the man commit
ting it; thus avenging in bestial fashion a bestial
deed, and reducing themselves to a level with
the criminal.
Lawlessness grows by what it feeds upon, and
when mobs begin to lynch for rape they speed
ily extend the sphere of their operations and
lynch many other kinds of crimes, so that two
t^ilrds of the lynchings are not for rape at all;
while a considerable proportion of the individ
uals lynched are innocent of all crimp. Governor
Candler of Georgia stated on one occasion some
years ago: "I can say of a verity that I have,
within the, last month, saved the lives of half
a dozen innocent Negroes who were pursued by
the mob, and brought them to trial in a court
of law in which they were acquitted." As
Bishop Galloway, of Mississippi, has finely said:
"When the rule of a mob obtains, that which
distinguishes a high civilization is surrendered.
The mob which lynches a Negro charged with
rape will In a little while lynch a white man sus
pected of crime. Every Christian patriot In
America needs to lift up his voice in loud and
eternal protest against the mob spirit that is
threatening the integrity of this Republic." Gov
ernor Jelks of Alabama has recently spoken as
follows: "The lynching of any person for what
ever crime is inexcusable anywhere— it is a de
fiance of orderly government; but the killing of
innocent people under any provocation is infi
nitely more horrible; and yet innocent people
are likely to die when a mob's terrible lust is
once aroused. Tho lesson is this: No good citi
zen can afford to countenance a defiance of tho
statutes, no matter what the provocation The
innocent frequently suffer, and. it is my obser
vation, more usually suffer than the guilty. The
white people of the South indict the whole'col
ored race on the ground that even the better ele
ments lend no assistance whatever in ferreting
out criminals of their own color. The respecta
ble colored people must learn not to harbor their
criminals, but to assist the officers In bringing
them to Justice. This is the larger crime, and it
provokes such atrocious offences as the one at
Atlanta. The two races can never get on until
there is an understanding on the part of both to
make common cause with the law-abiding
against criminals of any color."
Moreover, where any crime committed by a
member of one race against a member of an
other race is avenged in such fashion that it
seems as if not the Individual criminal, but the
whole race. Is attacked, the result is to exas
perate to the highest degree race feeling. There
is. but one .safe rule in dealing with black men
as with white men; it Is the, same rule that
must be applied In dealing with rich men and
poor men; that Is. to treat each man. whatever
his color, his creed or. his social position with
even handed Justice on his real worth as a man
White people owe it quite as much to them
selves as to the colored race to treat well the.
colored man who shows by his life that he de
serves such treatment; for it is surely the high
est wisdom to encourage In the colored race all
those Individuals who are honest, industrious,
law-abiding, and who therefore make good and'
safe neighbors and citizens. Reward or punish
the Individual on his merits as an individual.
Evil will surely come in the end to both races
if we substitute for this just rule the habit of
treating all the- members of the race, good and
bad, alike. There is no question of "social
equality" or "Negro domination" involved; only
the question of relentlessly punishing bad men.
and of securing to the good man the right to
his life, his liberty and the pursuit of his hap
piness as his own qualities of heart, head and
hand enable him to achieve it.
Every colored man should realize that the
worst enemy of his race is the Negro criminal,
and above all the Negro criminal who commits
the dreadful crime of rape; and it should be felt
as in the highest degree an offence against th*
Whole country, and "against the- colored race in
particular, for ■ colored man to fail to help the
officers of the law in hunting down with all pos
sible earnestness and zeal every such infamous
offender. Moreover, in my Judgment, the crime
of rape should always he punished with death,
as is the cast- with murder: assault with intent
to commit rape should be made a capita] crime,
at least in the discretion of the court; and pro
vision should be made by which the punishment
may follow Immediately upon the heels of the
offence; while the trial should be so conducted
that the victim need not be wantonly shamed
while giving testimony, and that the least pos
sible publicity shall lie given to the details
The members of the white race, on the other
hand, should understand that every lynching
represents by Just so much a loosening of the
bands of civilization; that the spirit of lynching
Inevitably throws into prominence in the com
munity all the foul and evil creatures who dwell
therein. No man can take part In the torture
of a human being without having his own moral
nature permanently lowered, Every lynching
means Just so much moral deterioration in all
the children who have any knowledge of It. and
therefore just so much additional trouble for
the next generation of Americans.
Let Justice be both sure and swift: but let it be
justice under the law. and not the wild and
rooked savagery of a mob.
There is another matter which has ■ direct
bearing upon this matter of lynching and of the
brutal cj me which sometimes calls it forth and
at other times merely furnishes th • excuse for Its
existence. 1' I* out Of the. Question for our
