The, president. V .principal reconinicn- i
latioiis were establishment of a budget
system for tin' national finances; reor
ganization of the taxation system with
simplification of the income and excess
profits; readjustment of the tariff sys
tem if necessary to meet (hanged world

the world;' recognition and relief for
veteran soldiers of the world war. par

Keep the United States independent of
foreign supply; an enlarged program

are connected with the failure on the
part of onr government to arrive
speedily at a just ami-permanent peace.

permitting return to normal conditions;
from the transfusion of radical theo
ries from seething European centers
pending such delay; from heartless pro-;
fiteer'mg resulting from the increase in!
the cost of living, and lastly from the
machinations of passionate and malov
olent agitators. With the return to nor
mal conditions this unrest will rapidly
disappear. "
The President renewed his recommen
dation for legislation to deal effectively
with "those persons who by violent
methods would abrogate our time-tested
institutions." &
Several recommendation some re
newals of previous ones, were- made by
the President to bring down the cost of
living. Among theni were extension of
the food control law to peacetimes for
the emergency, regulations for trans
portation of food in interstate com
meice, a cold storage law modeled aft
er the law in New Jersey, a law requir
ing .marks to show the length of time
foods are kept in storage, and a law to
secure "competitive selling and prevent
i;;u-t !i; !-io::able pVofits" by federal li
cense of corporations selling food in
interstate commerce.
. A long portion of the message was
devoted to a discussion of the condi
tion and rights of labor. "A definite
program to bring about an improvement
m the conditions of labor' and bring
about a genuine democratization of in
dustry was recommended. "The only
way to keep men from agitating
uuiiisi grievances is to remove
the grievances." said the Presi
dent's message. At another point it
declared "the seed of revolution is re
pression."
"The establishment of the principles
regarding labor laid down in the cov
enant of the league of nations, " aid
the message, "oilers us the way to in
dustrial peace and conciliation. No oth
er road lies open to us. Governments
must recognize the right of men to bar
gain collectively for humane objects.
Labor must be no longer treated as a
commodity." ".The right of individuals
to strike is inviolate," continued the

A considerable part of the personnel of

The supreme council decided today
that the question 'of Fiume should not

as - encountered a contrary laver off
sand in the work of excavating for the'
main pipe line of the Main street drain
age system. The trench has been dug
to a point south of the federal building
driveway and tor the greater part of
this djstance the pipe has been laid and
the trench filled.
Where the men are now working a
deposit of sand has been found under
neath the firm ground and this bothers
by caving in and undermining the sal
id ground above. This makes it nec
essary to brace the sides of the trench
to prevent accident. In one of the
cave-ins yesterday two men were bur

However, good progress is being made
and the job will be completed this fall.

October KetUrilS kXCeeded
Expectations Good
Prospects
LESS DEDUCTIONS
PRESENT MONTH
Over $10,000 Expected to Be Distrib
uted in This Locality for November
Milk and About $13,500 for Decem
ber Sales.
About $8,600 in checks has just been
received by producers in this section in
payment for the shipments of milk to
Springfield, Mass., m October, the first
for November and December over the
previous month will be due to increased
quantities shipped and the ehange in
transportation facilities.
But meaner returns for th?- first
month's shipments were expected "by
the CO odd milk producers, as it was not
expected that the A. H. Phillips Co.,
would be able to increase its retail
sales to absorb the entire fchipment as
whole miik during the first " month.
However, the checks just received were
. v . A.,lrJ.
out bv the dealer and the producers
committee showing that the retail sales
increased with sufficient rapidity in Oc
tober so that less than 35 per cent of
the milk had to be handled in the form
of butter. Consequently the full return
of nine and one-half cents a quart was
realized on two-thirds of the shipment.
The remaining one-third was turned in
to butter at the Guilford creamery ana
sold through the Thillips chain grocery
stores, without profit to the Phillips
concern, result in a total loss of
less than one cent a'quart, due to the
failure of the retail sales to absorb the
entire shipment as whole milk from the
start.
After deducting transportation
charges of practically two cents a
quart, and the above explained loss due
to the milk being handled in the form
of butter, the producers were paid a net
of G.43 cents a quart for their milk.
It is expected that the producers will
receive full price for all November ship
ments. The base price is 10 cents . a
quart, delivered in Springfield, and
from this there will be a transportation
deduction
a f,uart j
i.:na T' ,
of a little less than two cents
miart, tor truck service dv tne Haw
. . i t
kins Transportation Co., allowing the
producers slightly more than eight cents
i. ,.nrt tnr th entire month's shin-
ment. or.a.total of over $10,000 for No
vember sales.
Even more encouragement is felt in
iht nntlook fot the December milk Sit
nation, as the transportation has been
changed to rail shipments at a cost of
a little more than one haft cent a quart
The total 'deductions from the sales in
December. duriW which time it is ex-
pected that all milk will be handled as
whole milk, will be something less than
one cent a quart and the producers
should receive more than nine cents a
quart, net, which will mean that the re
I turn to Windham countv farmers m
round numbers will approximate $10
500
I While some dissatisfaction has been
caused oil account of the short asm of
cnmtv cans returned since the rail ship
ments went into effect it is expected
that this will be adiusted. and with this
end in view F. L. Parmelee of Putney
was in Springfield yesterday for the
marketing committee representing the
producers. When it is known that the
J cans are furnished by the. dealer to the
farmers at eight hundredths of a cent a
quart, it readily is understood that the
farmers could -not afford to own their
cans. This price for the rental of cans
was agreed upon between New England
dealers and the Xew England Milk Pro
ducers association

AUTOPSY TO BE
PERFORMED TODAY
Attorney General Also Orders Inquest
Over Death of Aged Townshend-Man "
Evident that - Shot Was Fixed at
Range of Not Over 16 Eods.
That whoever shot Sarrel Sawyer, the '
aged Townshend deer hunter "who was
killed yesterday morning by another hunt- -era
bullet, knew what he had done before 1
he left the scene of "the shooting is the
opinion of State's Attorney E. W. Gibson
of Brattleboro, who with Sheriff Frank L.
Wellman made a preliminary investigation
of. the shooting yesterday afternoon.
State's Attorney Gibson has no doubt that
the hunter supposed be was shooting at
a deer and afterwards learned his mistake,
but he also is convinced that the shooting
was wholly inexcusable and amounts -to
manslaughter. .
The state has made no charge against
anybody in connection with the case, and
whether it will do so depends upon fu
ture developments'. Attorney General
Frank C Archibald of Manchester was no
tified of such facts as the state's attorney -and
sheriff could gather, and he ordered
that an autopsy and an inquest be held.
Dr. B. H. Stone of the state laboratory
of hygiene in Burlington came here thia
afternoon on the 1.54 train to go to Town
shend to perform, the autopsy. No date
tor an inquest bas been set. '
Photographer Benjamin A, . Crown we"nt
to Townshend today to make gome photo
graphs of the premises where the fatality
occurred. He was accompanied by Sheriil
Wellman.- - ; ! vr
The- officer yesterday learned that Mr. '
Sawyer left his home at' I red WatsonV
about 6.30 o'clock in the morning and
went a mile up a steep grade and prepared
or was preparing a place where he could -
hide from view of any deer which might
chance to come that way,, when he was
shot not far from 7.30 o'clock.
For his hiding place Mr. Sawyer select
ed a spruce tree with branches hanging
close to the ground. He cut some branch
es to place in a position to hide himself
effectually, leaving ' a lookout through
which be could watch some apple trees
where in previous years a number of deer
had been shot, and 'through m which , he
could shoot if necessary.
It was at this spot that he was killed, -
being struck in the left side by a bullet,
which went through his heart.
The lay of the land at that point is such
that the officials are convinced that not
only was Mr. Sawyer not killed by a
stray bullet but that the hunter who
fired the shot was not more than 16 rods
distant. ,
Joseph Snow of Townshend, who is
employed as a canvasser- at 33 Cottage
street,. Rutland, reported to the Town
shend selectmen that he found the body-
about 8 o clock and that life had been ex
tinct apparently half An hour. Mr. Snow
came to Brattleboro yesterday afternoon
and returned to Rutland. -
