Opening or Library at Bevarlv Manor
Aoademy.
Within the past few days the new
library of Beverly Manor Academy has
been opened to the pupils and patrons
who are already beginning to realize
its value and importance as a factor
in school work. The library at present
contains books to the value of about
$175, covering the subjects of religion,
pedagogy, fiction, history, general lit
erature, science and nature study.
Tbey have been carefully catalogued
and classified by the library commit
tee, under whose auspices the library
will be conducted. With tbe excep
tion of about one hundred volumes
donated by friends of tbe teachers, the
library was purchased from the Cald
well-Sites Co. of this city, under the
guarantee that all books in the select
ed list should be printed on good paper,
in attractive and durable bindings.
Tbe contract was strictly adhered to,
and it is a source of much pride and
gratification to the members of com
mittee that there is not a cheap nor
shoddy looking book in the library.
Altho the Caldwell-Sites Co.'s prices
were somewhat lower than those of a
number of tbe leading book jobbers of
tbe country from whom the commit
tee received price lists, three hundred
Holden bookcovers were donated by
the Caldwell-Sites Co., which also did
all necessary printing for the library
free of charge. The Beverly Manor
School Board also assisted very mate
rially in making the library a success
by having the woodwork painted, the
walls neatly papered and commodious
bookshelves arrauged thereon.
M together the library opens under
auspicious circumstances and
should be distinctly successful in cre
ating a taste for good literature among
the pupils, in leading tbera to more
systematic reading along their lines of
study, and in bringing more closely
together tbe potent forces of home
and school.

The Pennsylvania Sells C & 0.
It was announced that the Pennsyl
yania Railroad has sold to Kuhn,Loeb
& Co. 156,300 shares of tbe Chesapeake
& Ohio common stock, which com
prised the entire holdings of this stock
by the Pennsylvania and affiliated
lines. The Pennsylvania Railroad
held 101,300 shares of Chesapeake &
Übio, and the Pennsylvania Company
40,000sbares, the par value of these
holdings of tbe Pennsylvania Railroad
Company and its affiliated lines had
a par value of $15,630,000, the Northern
Central owning 15,000 shares.
An impression appears to prevail in
Wall street that the Pennsylvania hold
ings of Chesapeake & Ohio would ul
timately be sold to the Big Four, giv
ing tbe latter road complete control of
the property, and that tbe two lines
would practically become merged.
This condition has been forced by
the anti trust laws which forbid con
solidations for the purpose of increas
ing rates. Congress has just met and
the Pennsylvania is evidently taking
to the tall timbers.

"ARE YOU A MASON?" ,
"Are you a Mason" is a good tonic ,
for "that tired feeling" and the an
nouncement that it is coming to town '
soon is the first pleasant news since
the lassitude caused by the beat of
summer. This famous farce Is one of
tbe most laughable pieces ever pres
ented on the American stage. It has
been played continuously in this coun
try and in Eugland ever since it was
first presented in 1901. In London
alone it has been running for over
three years and it ran for over 300
weeks at Wallack's theatre in New
York. Id Germany, France, Italy,
Russia and even in far off Japan this
brilliant comedy has been a great fa
vorite for years. At tbe Beverly De

A Weber and Fields' chorus Is com
parable to nothing on the face of th c

of them are lost in tbe crowd and their

Tolty" which comes to the Beverly,
December 11th, will be seen what is
said to be the most swagger chorus in
tbe country, a feast of form and beau

HOSPITALS ALL OVERTHE CONTINENT FIND PE-RU-NA VALUABLE I \ TREATING ALL CATARRHAL DISEASES.
CATARRH of the respiratory organs
is a common ailment in Canada for
at least two-thirds of the year. <
This condition is no doubt caused by
the long, severe winters experienced in
this part of the continent.
Therefore, when Pemna was dis- |
covered by Canadian people to be a re- <
liable remedy for these catarrhal dis
eases, it at once became a popular mcdi- (
cine, not only among individuals and ;
in families, but in the great hospitals,
where it was used as a preventative and =
relief in hundreds of cases. 1
These institutions do not hesitate to i
give their endorsement of the remedy <
which has been so helpful in the treat- I
ment of their poor and sick.
Among these institutions is that of
the Sisters of Good Shepherd, who gave (
the following endorsement:
Tbe Peruna Company,
Columbus, Ohio.
Having used Peruna for the past few
months, for our sick and poor, we are 1
happy to say that it has given :'S great ]
satisfaction. i
The Sisters of tbe Good Shepherd, l
August 20, 1903. Montreal.
After a continued use of the remedy, i
this institution has found no reason to i
change its good opinion of the remedy
and expresses its satisfaction in the fol- '
lowing terms: ;
The President's Messaae.,
President Roosevelt's message to
Congress was a very voluminous docu
ment, and has created mrch com
ment, especially his recommendation
on the Japanese question. Dispatches
from San Francisco says that he has
stirred up a storm in California, which
is felt from end to end and along the
Pacific coast, by the statements in his
mesiiage on the Japanese question.
Amotig the masses, and parti
cularly among union laborers, the bit
terest feeling prevails, and it is hinted
freely that unless something interve
ness to change sentiment, he haj driv
en California, if not the entire coast,
from the republican ranks.
HIS RECO.MMBNDATIO'NS.
In bis message he makes the i'ollow
ing recommendations:
A graduated tax on ii.beritai 'es, so
as to reduce "swollen fortunes. ' and a
graduated income tax.
Further extension of Fed*ra' | ewer,
so tbat the national Governmer may
supervise all interstate corpo .tions
and their business.
A law to limit the hours of w >rk of
railroad employes.
Compulsory arbitration of Be inus
disputes between employers and em
ployes, so as to prevent strikes.
That Japanese be put on tbe sume
basis as other foreigners and giv n the
righr of naturalization as At erican
citizens.
Law to prohibit corporations from
contributing to campaign fuul
Tbat entire control over divbi • aud
marriage laws be given the F d.it.l
Government.

Building of one battleship a yeai to
maintain the navy at its present
strength.
Fue trade with the Pnilippinen
Drastic laws to prevent cuiid .>ai>.jr.
That the Government oe given right
of appeal in ciiminal cases, as it "has
now dttiuitely begun a polio of resort
ing 10 the criminal law in those trust
and interstate commerce cases where
sucb a course offers a reajonable chance
of success."
That courts be prohibited from set
ting aside judgments aid granting
new trials ou technicalities where there
has been no miscarriage of justice.

We found Peruna a re/ ct in several
cases.
We can say it is a good tonic and we I
are very thankful
Sisters of the Good Shepherd.
When catarrh once fastens itself upon
the system, it becomes au obstinate dis i
ease to eradicate.
A systemic remedy—one that reaches '
every internal organ of the body—U an |
absolute necessity.
Peruna <s just snch a remedy. It'
searches out the cause of the disease, |
healing and strengthening the mucous
membranes, and thus giving Nature an
opportunity to perform her part of the
restorative process.
One of the many hospitals which
have found Peruna of value in treating
old and obstinate cases of catarrh is the
Hospital St. John, who write, as
follows:
"We are happy to tell you that your
Peruna has given us satisfaction. Three
patients have tried it, one 68 years old,
Renoui Dupuis, afflicted with catarrh, is
much relieved, more than he has been
for a number of years.
'•A young girl, IS years old, bad an
obstinate cough, wbicb bait a bottle of
Peruna caused to disappear.
"As to myself, two bottles have con
vinced mo that Peruna Is magnificent

fore • treatment I could not

"Through these three cases we desire
to make known to the public the ef
ficiency of your remedy."
Hospital St. John, of St. Johns,
Province of Quebec.
A later letter received from the same
j institution reads as follows :
"Three weeks ago I wrote to tell
you how satisfactory we found
, Peruna. We recommend it highly for
colds, coughs, catarrh and neuralgia.
"1 have used it myself as a tonic with
the best results, taken as directed, half
a teaspoonful every half hour."
Peruna not only promptly relieves
coughs and colds in their lirst stages,
but is equally prompt and efficient for
catarrhal diseases in the chronic stage.
Of course, it is only reasonable to
suppose that a great deal less medicine
will be necessary tc cure a slight attack
of catarrh than would be required to
relieve the ailment after it had been al
lowed to become chronic.
Directions for taking the remedy will
be found on each bottle, also in Dr.
Hartman's book, called "The Ills of
Life," which can he obtained from your
druggist for the a.-king.

Hartman, President of the. Hartman
