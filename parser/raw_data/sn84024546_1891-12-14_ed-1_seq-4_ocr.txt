riGIlTIXG THK KOXG WAY.
Ireland furnished another factional
affray vesterdav. The opposing crowds
met at Waterford and the cobblestone ami '
Hie blackthorn played a more com hieing
part in the political arguments of the
McCarthyites and the Parnellites than
Hie impassioned oratory of the leaders.
But even- blow struck hurt instead of
helped the cause of Erin in America.
The spectacle of Davitt in a cell as a
political prisoner and Davitt bleeding on a
Xact'onal field of dishonor are two widely
different events in the campaign for the
betterment of the struggling Isle. One
created that sentiment which touchedfree
doin's heart and unclasped pocketbooks;
ihe other will, as similar events already
J'ave, call forth censure and further check
the flow of gold as well as the expressions
of sympathy for the cause the factions
Jed by the warring leaders represent.
The Wnterford affray, like others of
lite, was not brought about by Tory pro
test or constabulary interference. It was
solely factional leader against leader.
In mipIi intense pergonal politics the
cause of Ireland is bound to be forced to
the background, at least temporarily.
Erin needs fighters brave, tme, gallant
fighters, too. But they should stand
shoulder to shoulder instead of face to
face now.
c.ould-s alleged shortness.
The story that Gould and his hopeful
projeny have been caught short of the
Stock market and are in a position to be
:ee7l by the general improvement pro
fits a prospect of the biter being bit and
Mie fowler caucht in his own net, which
cannot be regarded as unpieasing by the
lovers of poetic justice
! But natural justice cannot be relied on
1 to always work in the poetic fashion. Peo
ple Thy rely on the stock market working
out its own revenge on its greatest manip
ulator should not forget one important
factor, and that is Mr Gould himself.
That astute individual has been short of
the market before, and the means by,
wbwli he extricated himself from former
tight places, though ancient, are as effec
tive as ever If he is short of his own
stocks, the printing pres is as prompt as
ever, and if that wav is not open the pos
sibility of leaving his brokers in the lurch
prists just as it did in 18C9. Xow that Mr.
Gould is a pattern for TVall street, he
proiably would not like to repeat those
strokes of financial strategy on which' he
built his greatness; but it is not likely that
he will give up very many of his millions
when such means are open to evade that
catastrophe.
The Wall street operators should not be
too prompt in advertising that they will
have the skin of the lion on sale at an
parly date. 'When there is anyskinningto
be done Jay Gould is liable to do some of
It himself.
A GOOD WORK.
Chicago is engaged with its customary
encrcy in an effort to rid itself of a notori
ous public evil which it shares with two or
three other leading cities. Our telegrams
show that the press and public are push
ing the work of abolishing the scarcely
concealed gambling center known as
Garfield Park.
It has long been apparent to the careful
Jwiver. een from a distance, that such
racc-otmn-es as Gloucester, Guttenberg
and Garfield Park were blots on nine
teenth century civilization. The betting
at weil-conducted race-courses is promi
Bent enough in all conscience; but these
fctralled race-courses are operated simpl
for the garni ling practice of skinning the
oi"ary. The victim who bets on
fneh races is of exactly the same class as
tlie cue who thinks he can beat the
IhimUe-rig game. The supply of such
wm,i,-tons is unlimited, however, and the
business they support grows to such
dimensions that the so-called race-courses
become open exchanges for the merchan
dising of all classes of vice.
It is a good sign that ourcitics arc taking
up the workot abolishing such institutions
of debauchery. Pittsburg has not been
cuised bj anything of the sort, the nearest
appioach being the pool-rooms, which were
wiped out some years ago. If any attempt
should b made to start such a resort of
Rambling in this vicinity it is to be hoped
that our people will promptly begin the
work of wiping it out as energetically as
the Chicagoans have done.
A STRIKING CONTRAST.
The Philadelphia Prcs asserts from
what ma beiegarded as inside informa
tion that the charge against Collector
IVanncastle is the alleged failure to de
posit Govrrnmeut money within the time
specified by l.iw. As it was, according to
the worst statement of the case, in the
Collector's hands, and has been fully de
posited, the xhargc could not be made
mjeh of, unless there was a purpose to
serve out a political revenge. But it suf
fices to hang the remark of the Prett that
"Holding back public money has been
quite a common practice In Pennsylvania
late'y"
It has indeed ; and holding it back so
efficaciously that several hundreds of thou-.
sands have pntireiy disappeared, in the
ch'ef characteristic of the latest exposure
in that hue. The Pre?s remarks that "it
lias not been looked upon as a serious mat
ter," but it goes on to say that ?'tlre Fed
eral Government has, however, a higher.,,
standard." It might also have more per
tinently asserted that sundry poli-'
ticiens and organs m this btate liav.; a
very different standard as regards State
officials and JYuei al officia's who do no'
suit them. We ca'inot recall atiVrdiSfciaUd 1
of the Republican leaders who are afttr j,
L?T U'LISIIED FKRKUAllV
Mr. Warmcasiie's scalp that the State offi
cials whose negligence, to use the mildest
term, left a million-and-a-half of the State
funds to be swallowed up in the Bardsley
crash should he removed from office. Nor,
indeed, do we remember that the Press
took occasion to frankly inform the Sen-,
ate that it was covering up crookedness m
its dodge of the investigation. Violation
cf the law and some very suspicious cor
respondence, all resulting in a loss of the
State funds to an enormous sum, was
I easily covered up without protest; but a
technical omission made good the next
day is an offense not to he condoned if
the official is vour political enemy.
In this attitude those who are seeking to
displace Mr. "Warmcastle class themselves
rather unfortunately. It looks as if the
gigantic steals which have a surplus to be
handed around, whether in the shape of
rebates or otherwise, are the offenses they
find themselves able to tolerate.
NOT IN THE LAW.
The President's Message presents the
status of the silver certificates in a some
what different way from that which Secre
tary Foster's speeches have done. The
Message argues "that for every dollar of
these notes issued a full dollar's worth of
I silver bullion is at the time deposited in
the Treasury as a security for its rcdernp-
statement that the sUver
.. ,,
1 UOI1.
uuuiuu is regaruuu as auuuiiij jui nc v
demption of certificates, or notes, conveys
a decided impression that the bullion is to
be used for the redemption of the notej.
But a different view from that has been
presented by the Secretary of the Treas
ury. He has stated that the certificates
aro rp be redeemed in goldand has even
gone so far as to point out the means by
which it is to be secured for that purpose
in the power of the Secretary to sell
bonds. On that statement the certificates
are not silver certificates, but promises of
the Treasury to pay gold; and the immense
stock of silver in the Treasury is reduced
to the position of a commodity for which
the Government has no use whatever. It is
true in fact that the new silver certificates,
like the old ones, are sustained at par be
cause the Government makes them ex
changeable, for gold. But the manner in
which the Secretary has dwelt on this
feature only increases the anomaly of
issuing certificates professedly on the basis
of silver deposits, but with the avowal that
the silver is not to be used in redeeming
them.
The President takes the other horn of
the dilemma by intimating that a dollar's
worth of silver meaning a good dollar's
worth is to be used for he redemption.
If this were unquestionably the case, it
would come very near the proper solution
of the silver problem. But, even on the
high authority of the President's Message,
the statement can hardly be accepted.
Suppose that a large amount of these cer
tificates were presented for redemption
and the Treasury .had not the gold to pay
them. What warrant would he have in
law for redeeming a dollar note with any
greater amount of silver than that which
the statutes already prescribe as making a
dollar? And, if there were such a war
rant, what an anomaly it would be for a
government to first say that so much silver
shali make a silver dollar, and then to pay
out ten, fifteen or twenty per cent more
sliver to redeem its promise to pay a silver
dollar!
The question is further complicated on
the supposition that such a warrant exists
in the law of 1890, by the absence of any
rule governing the redemption of silver
bullion. If a man deposits a thousand
ounces of silver, when it is worth 95c, gets
certificates for 5930, and brings the certifi
cates back for redemption when silver is j
worth 90c, how much silver will he get?
Will he get back as much as the certificate
calls for at its new market value, or as
much as he deposited?- On the one hand,
will the holders of these certificates run
the chances of the varying value of the
bullion, or will the Government take that
risk on the other?
The fact is that the law does not pro
vide for the redemption suggested, and
leaves these questions entirely unan
swered. If Congress had summoned up
courage to settle the question on that line,
it would have perceived that there is no
stopping place short of issuing a new
silver dollar containing as much bullion as
is equal in value to a gold dollar.
THK TREDICTOR OF EARTHQUAKES
Of course it had to come. The informa
tion is imparted that three weeks before
the great earthquake in Japan the Cabinet
'of the Mikado received an anonymous let
ter foretelling the earthquake and predict
ing the exact date. The. fatality which
accompanies such warnings, that they are
always made known after the event,
should not dispose the mind to dull and
infidel incredulity. It is in the assertion
that the warning wasvanonymous that the
mind discovers reason to doubt Such
warnings, especially the ones the public
hears of after the earthquake, always bear
the name of Wiggins. If Wiggins has
adopted the modest practice of omitting
his signature it is something to encour
age. But such a departure is foreign to
the nature of Wiggins. That genius has
partially retired from the public gaze in
consequence of the obstinacy of the seis
mic convulsions in refusing come when he
does call for them. But in the line of verification-claimant
for unsuspected prophe
cies there is but one Wiggins; and let us
hope there never will be hut one.
EXMITY TO RAIL DEVELOPMENT.
C. P. Huntington is being quoted by
cotemporaries as administering a crusher
to the people of Texas. It takes the shape
of a letter to a man who has a franchise to
sell, declaring that owing to the hostility
of the people of Texas to the existing rail
roads "the consideration of future invest
ments will have to be deferred until
capitalists can be assured that their in
vestments, instead of being threatened
with virtual confiscation, shall receive the
same fair treatment that is accorded to
other forms of property."
If Texas legislation has threatened
nuntington's property with virtual con
fiscation it has don every wrong. Wedoubt,
however, whether any confiscation has
been threatened or accomplished so
effective as that which Huntington and
his associates practiced on the property
which was supposed to secure the Govern
ment loan to the Central Pacific Railway.
It is also pertinent to state, when such
talk is heard, that nothing is said of
such enmity to railroads as a decree
that no one should be permitted
to build railroads in Texas or any other
State except one or two specified and fa
vored interests. Yet exactly that decree
was issued by an agreement between the
trunk 'line Presidents and the railway
bankers of New York when the South
Peiin deal was carried through in defiance
alike of th.i courn and Constitution of
Pennsylvania. The further fact being
stated that, this extra-legislative ordinance
excluding all railway building from Penn
sylvania, and Xcu York except by favor
of the Vand&rbilts and
the Pennsylvania
Railroad people has been maintained, it is
plain that the. Legislature of Texas is not
so Inimical to new railway investments as
the corporate and financial powers of
Wall street
Mr. Huntington may rejoin to this that
he does not propose to build any railways
in Pennsylvania or New York, either.
This would be true: But it leaves the
fact thatihe regards the legislation of the
Wall street powers that no new roads
shall be built in a certain section as a law
to goindlsputed; while the Texas legisla
tion, enacted by the representatives of the
1 1 people, is a thing not to be endured.
rjirKOYKMENT AMONG CRANKS.
The gentleman who makes himself
known to the country as "America's
spiritual adviser" cannot be too highly
commended.for the improvement he has
introduced in the crankish industry of
collecting large sums from the multi
millionaires. Instead of going at Jay
Gould with a dynamite cartridge or a dag
ger, he stepped into one of the New York
courts and requested that the necessary
legal process be issued to make the Wall
street king give up ?500,000,000, which he
claimed to be doe him. This is not only
a commendable example for the cranks
in general, but it exemplifies the happy
influence which ourinstitutionshave upon
that prominent but rather uncertain class.
It has heretofore been doubted and feared
that the prosecution of their claims on the
money kings could not be reconciled with
the system of government bylaw; but the
gentleman referred to illustrates a convic
tion on the part of one of them that the
best way is to act strictly in accordance
with it It istobe wished that a similar
reformation mightibe effected on the gen
tlemen who are theobjects of these press
ing attentions.
Theee is an idea that the defeated candi
dates for the Speakership must resign their
Congressional seats. Such talk has been
heard about JIUls, and now the Atlanta r
Constitution conies at Tom Watson, the Al
liance candidate for Speaker, with a demand
that he shall resign because he opposed
Crisp. Xb one has ventured to suggest that
Tom Eeed resign, however, obviously in
view of the futility of snob an Idea. But the
suggestion is equally futile as to the other
statesmen. The utmost in the light of resig
nation that can be expected from them is
that with which they accept the situation.
Senator Stewakt is early in the field
with a bill to make the Chinese exclusion
act more effective. He proposes that here
after all Chinese who have left the country
tforany reason whatever shall be totally
prohibited from coming back. His bill
strangely omits to provide in addition that
all the Chinese in the country shall bo sent
home on a visit; but that can be added later
on.
The Governor's announcement last week
that the State debt has been reduced over
two and a half millions during the past year
did not mention the fact that if the Auditor
General and State Treasurer had done tholr
dutya least another million would have
been available for the same pnrpose. No
hones'; person conld have disputed tho
statement of tho fact; but the represcnta'
tlves of the peonle having decided that a
little mattor like that is not worth consider
ing, tho Governor leaves tho pooplo to make
their own deductions and reflections.
Joaquin Miller's son says that the im
pulse to rob a stage coach came upon hiin
"like an inspiration." Another case of
heredity gone wrong. The inspiration could
not have been worse if it had been more
exactly transmitted and he had been in
spired to write poetry.
TrrE confusion between the sound of the
words "bomb" and "bond," which gave rise
to another dynamite scare in New York,
produces a suggestion that the pronuncia
tion shall be revised. This might be done
by pronouncing "bomb" in the rural style as
if spelt with a "u." Of course, this would
render the word liable to be mistaken for
tho other descriptive "bum," but that is a
matter of minor Importance, in view of the
liability of both to be bursted, and the fact
that both shall bo abolished anyhow.
The New York Press fears that the Plumb
resolution for tho removal of General
Grant's remains will put a stop to the sub
scriptions for the New Tork monument. It
fails to explain how a thing can be stopped
which is already making no progress.
IT is well to honor a retiring official, but
the moans adopted by inadvertence oonvey
an unconscious sarcasm. A presentation by
Republican Congressmen to the Hon. Ed
ward MoPherson, the other day, on the oc
casion of his retirement from the House
Clerkship, is to be regarded as an expression
of esteem. But the fact that the gift be
stowed was a soup-tureen is an effort which
might bo suspected of humor if tho sugges
tion were not equally applicable to the
donors and recipient.
IT appears that M. Clemenceau has per
suaded Floquet and Cassagnao to arrange
their differences without a duel. Why does

The innocence with which the Roman
and English authorities announco ttut the
President is going to have the Constitution
amended in view of tho Now Orleans trouble
is a refreshing oasis in the dreary wasto of
international events. The basis of the idea
Is clearly the President's suggestion that the
United Statos Courts shall have jurisdiction
over offenses against treaty obligations a
power already provided in the first clause of
Article III., Sec. II., of the Constitution.
If any person has a real good patent for

The New York TForfd publishes an inter

pressed a wish to havo her famous hus
band's remains left at Riverside. This wish,
if authentic will have great weight with the
American people. But should not a similar
sense of delicacy cause Now Yorkers to

FERDINAND AND COLUMBUS.
tWBCTBN TOR TOE DISPATCH: 1
I had the privilege the other day of
riding in a cable car next to the King of
Spain. His Majesty, like Haronn al Baschid,
was traveling, "disguised as a gentleman."
He did not appear greatly different from
other mortals. He put on no Imperial airs.
He paid 5 cents for his fare like the rest of
us, and grumbled within himseir like the
rest of us, at tho two extra pennies. The'
King was dressed like a business man and a
Pittsbnrger. In fact his roval vestments,
with his crown and lite sceptro, were packed
away, so he whiipored to me in confidence,
in a brown paper parcel, which he carefully
carried under his arm. After all, it is tho
clothes that make tho king. Nobody stands
in any awe of a king in a derby hat.
The mime of my friend, the King of Spain,
was Ferdinand. He was that Fordlnand
who has come down in a somewhat undigni
fied attitude along tho staircase of history
as the husband of Isabella. Ferdinanft was
here in Pittsburg in attendance upon tho
"National Pageant." Ho was 'present with
all his good clothes on, in that opening
scene where Christopher Columbns asks
leave (and money) of the sovereigns of
Spain to go and discover America. He had
no respect for Christopher Columbus, and
was quite disgusted when Isabella declared
that he should bo helped in his scheme for
tho discovery of America, even if she had to
pawn her Jewels.
Where Kings and Qaoens Are Good.
Tarleattx and pictures have a great
advantage over real life. Thoy represent
thine .as they ought to be. Christopher
Columbus ought to have been a hero.
Isabella ought to have pawned her Jowols.
The fact is, however, that Isabella not only
did not send her rings and bracelets to the
shop of the three balls, but she never prom
ised to do so. More than that, even had she
made any such impulsive and unthinking
promise she wonld not havo hesitated to
break it. no, not for a single- minute. Queen
Isabella, or Castile, told lies. Sir Arthur
Helps, always eager to find some good side
to everything, says of Isabella: "Perhaps
there is hardly any great personage whose
name and authority are found in connection
with so much that is strikingly evil, all of it
done, or rather assented to, upon the high
est and purest motives!" Mr. Justin Win
sor agrees with this opinion up to tho word
"evil." He thinks that tho less said about
Isabella's motives the better.
King Ferdinand, p Mr. Winsor's pages,
was rather a decent sort of king as kings
went in the fifteenth century. Kings, it ap
pears, were rather disreputablo characters
about that time. "Ho did not extort money;
he only extorted agonized confessions. He
said mosses, and prayed equally woll for
God's benediction on evil as on good things.
Ho made promises and then got the papal
dispensation to break them. He juggled in
state policy as his mind changed, and he
worked his craft very readily. Machlavelll
would havo liked this in him, and indeed he
was a good scholar of an existing school,
which counted the act of outwitting better
than the arts of honesty: and perhaps the
world is not loftier in tho purposes of state
craft to-day." Mr. Winsor does not live in
Pennsylvania.
A Debt That Should Be Honored.
BUT Christopher Columbus this un
fortunate adventurer fares worst of alt "We
are all interested just now in Christopher
Columbus. It is true thathe will not appear
in tho National Pageant which the United
States of America is preparing nt Chicago
with anything like the prominence that he
had hero in Pittsburg on Friday and Satur
day of last week. The Columbian Exposi
tion is in danger of leaving Columbus out.
The nation will obscure tho man. Tho hero
who set a red mark in the history books
under the date of HM will not come in for
any enthuslastio laudation. Nevertheless. we
are in debt to Christopher Columbus. And
it is proper that at this time of day we should
Interest ourselves in him and learn what
ever can be learned about him.
I have been reading Mr. Justin AVlnsor's
book, "Christopher Columbns, and How Ho
Deceived and Imparted the Spirit of Dis
covery." It is timely, exhaustive, interest
ing. It is crammed full of pictures. All the
old portraits of the Admiral, all the old
maps and globes, the old geographical
guesses at tho world, are set down here in
generous profusion. The book Is a library
and a picture gallery at the same time. One
of the most interesting features of modern
study is the way in which old treasures
come to light. Forgotten manuscripts, hid
don relics, buried buildings, are every now
and then appearing out of the long past
like communicative ghosts. Nobody can
tell what will be found next. The mummy
of the Pharaoh of the Exodus, the account
that Aristotlo wrote of the Constitution of
Athens, tho Teaching, of the TwoIvb
Apostles, and a hundred other cnrioslties
and precious things longaccounted lost have
been looked up.
History Constantly Revised.
Very little in history can he called
final. Tho histories even of ancient Greece
and Bomo need to bo rewritten overy year
or two to keep them up to date. When
Irving and Preseott wrote about Columbus,
60 or 70 years ago, needs utmost as much re
vision as the ideas that Columbus had about
the land he found on this side of tho ocean.
Mr. Winsor shows again and again where
these two most picturesque and charming
writers err. Mr. Winsor is not himself
either a picturesque or a charming writer.
Ho makes no effort aftor felicitlos of style.
Preseott and Irving are much more delight
ful to read. Mr. Winsor's strength lies in
his straight forward, clear, well arranged
and thoroughly considered presentation of
all tho facts. Columbus discovered America.
Winsor, for English readors, has discovered
Columbus. ,
One of tho queer things about Columbus
is the small amount of really accurate and
unquestioned information there is about
him. A man who lived in the end of the
fifteenth century, who wrote innumerable
letters, and whoso biography was composed
by his own son, ought to be pretty fairly
known. Unfortunately, Columbns and his
son were the vaguest aud roost unsatisfac
tory of writers. The consequence is that
the number of things we know not concern
ing Christopher Columbns Is large. Nobody
knows when the Admiral was born, nor
whore he was born, nor what he looked
like, nor what his name was. As many cities
fight over the honor of his nativity as dis
puted over blind Homer. Mr. Winsor givos
seven portraits, as unlike one from another
as the portraits of Mary, Queen of Scots. As
for his name, the Admiral, like Shakespeare,
followed the privilege of uenlus, and spelled
hisnamo according to his changing frame of
mind. When ho was sick he spelled it one
way; when ho got better ho spelled it an
other; when ho was successful he changed
It; when ho was unlucky, depressed or mo
mentarily humble he made another varia
tion in his name; after ho had been at
church, or had said his prayers, he had still
another sort of signature.
Columbus of the Earth Earthy.
Indeed, there almost seem tohaye been
two or three different Christophors. Bnselly
de Lorgncs and some other enthusiastic
Frenchmen -are trying to mako out that
Columbus was a saint. They want the Pope
to pronounce his beatification. Columbus,
they say, was a great missionary. Like the
Jioly man from whom he got his name, he
went at his peril through tho deep waters.
carrying tho Christ upon his shoulders.
Columbus certainly sot up crosses over on
thee shores: built altars and had mass said
upon them in a service whose stateliness
Impressed tho natives; and caused the first
gold found upon this continent to be mado
into a chalico for the holy sacrament.
On tho other hand, here is this unbiased
story of Mr. Winsorjs. Christopher comes
down from his pedestal to be rudely beaten
about tho ears with his own halo. Christo
pher Columbus wanted money. He was very
fur from being one of the "noblemen of
truth," serving her for love. Ho wanted to
bo paid for his service in position, in title,
and in good solid maravedls. He was re
fused help ngaln nnd again at royal courts
on account of the magnitude of his de
mands. He loved adventure, but he loved
money more. Tho one thing that he and his
royal patrons wanted was gold. Thus he
staited out trying to get into the golden
East by sailing West, carrying a letter to the
Great Khan of Tartary, and a metallurgist
to "pronounce upon preoious ores."
When the little fleet was nearly orrlved
upon theee shores, and floating branohes in
the water showed the nearness of land, the
Admiral saw a light one dark night mov

the Admiral said he saw a light and when
the real land appeared the next day, he

A Better Sailor Than, Saint.
Then, among the natives, Columbus
was in search of gold. The spirit of dis
covery waned; he was an adventurer, after
money. Presently, when monoy seemed
scarce, he sent back shiploads of staves,
planting in the hearts of tho inoffensive
people a deep and Justifiable hatred of the
whites. He did that for monoy, and many
other equally bad things with an equally un
worthy motive. Columbus had his eye on
gain. He wanted to mako all he could, and
cared little how much lying or stealing bad
to be done In the making. He was a misera
ble failure as the leader of a colony. He lost
almost all tho friends ho ever had. He
thought ho had discovered paradise; but
there Is only one place where that celestial
country can really bo discovered, and that
is in a man's own good, contented heart.
Nevertheless, in the year 1192 Christopher
Columbus discovered America. He did push
out over the dark ocean day after day with
alravery and a persistency that no sailor of
his time had shown. And he did demon
strate to the worla in which he lived that
there was land beyond the sea. And that
began the emigration which, good and bad
together, has made up tho United Stdtes of
America. Christop'ber Columbns may not
havo been a saint, but ho was certainly a
good sailor. Even Mr. Winsor credits him
with that.
AHCIENT CLIFF DWEXLKES.
Mammies Found in a Hitherto Unexplored
Canyon of the Bockles.
Florida, Col., Dec 13. James Donahne
and Henry Merritt havo Just returned lrom
Mancos canyon and report the finding in
that neighborhood of what is evidently a
prehistoric cemetery in the Mancos canyon.
While they woro climbing about tho moun
tains in the vicinity of the dwellings they
were struck by what appeared to bo a nar
row trail leading up the sides of an abrupt
oliff. This trail had become almost obliter
ated by the wear of centuries of storms, Dut
it was plain enough to be traced by a prac
ticed eye, and they set about following it to
its termination.
They succeeded in tracing the path in and
out among the rooky clefts until it took
them to a small plateau, which was hidden
in the mountains in such a manner that ac
cess was impossible except through tho
trail traveled over the cliffs and rocks. Tho
tombs of the cliff dwellers were out out of
solid rock all around tho walls of the pla
teau, and were walled up and cemented in
such a inanniv that at first there was noth
ing to show that thograves were there.
By accident a piece of stone became de
tached from one of the walls, and showed
that it had been comented. An investiga
tion also showed that the whole cliff was
honeycombed wlth.the tombs and caoh one
contained two or more bodies. An opening
was made into several of them nnd the
bodies found in the shape of woll preserved
mummies. It was impossible to carry one
of the mummies down the trail, so the" men
contented themselves with carrying away
pieces of tho oloth which was around tho
bodies and other evidences of tho truth of
their story.

A CREEPING BOULDER,
It
Has Traveled Forty Feet Without
tho
Aid of Any Human Agency.
Wiksted, Coifn., Dec. 13. Savants-are in
vited to solve the problem of how a boulder,
weighing over ton tons, can travel a distance
of 40 feet In 20 years without human agency.
The stone is in West Hill Pond, in the town
of Winchester, about four miles from here,
and for years it has been a sort of boundary
mark.
Becent surveys show that it is not where
it was ten years ago by several feet. Tho
water in the pond is ten feet below its
natural lovel and the rock is partly out of
water. In front of it a heap of stones and
gravel has been forced up as it has moved
onward, and in lis rear is a deep channel
through which the rock plowed its way.
Manylevel-headcd and truthful people say
they have known of this phenomenon for 20
years.

tonlshed at the lack of evidence of any ener
getic and reliable system of city govern
ment; he mourned the absenee of a good,
puro water supply; he was surprised to find
nowhere the municipal swimming bath, art
gallery, museum, free library, and tho like
all of which he was accustomed to In cities
of Pittsburg's size in England. With egard
to the ffea library, he owned that Pittsburg
will be well supplied when tlm new one is
built; but he said ho thought it was rather
degrading for u city of Pittsburg's size to be
dependent on individual generosity for any
thing so necessary. Ho admired our methods
of street locomotion, but said this, as well as
mostelsoin the city, seemed duo rather to
us as Individuals than as a body corporate.
Ho was very inuon astonished at
the number of loafers, to be fonrtU
about tho streots in tho evenings, and
remarked that he found It very difficult to
reconcile this habit with the estimnto he
had formed of us as industrious and ener
getic almost to a fault. He vowed that per
sonally ho found loafing far more tiring
than working, and he thonght that would be
tho opinion of Englishmen nt large. He
conld'nt "make out" why tho young men
did not find lectures, ctassos, gymnastics,
concerts, books, walks and so an to fill up
their snare time more Instructively nnd
with more recreation than they could possi
bly get from hanging around a street cornor
or a vacant doorway, to the inconvenience
of passe rsby.
Apropos of tho walks he had spoken of,
when questioned ho said that for exercise
and flno views he couldn't wish for better
country there was around this city. He told
a very funny story to illustrate tho "free
dom" of this country, and it will gain by be
ing repeated in his own words as nearly as
possible. ."This wasn't in Pittsburg; I was
staying down in Louisville then. It was a
wet Sunday afternoon, and as I hadn't been
long in this country I didn't know tbat I
should be in danger of confinement as a
lunatic if I ventured to walk five miles into
the country for the sake of exercise, when I
could havo reached my destination in
less time and without trouble cither by
the steam cars or behind a pair of mules.
Not knowing then what danger I was about
to ran, I donnod tho oostnme I should have
worn at home under like circumstances.
The same costume, except thai had I been
at home I should probably have worn
knickerbockers: fortunatelv 1 had none
with me I say fortunately, because if I had
gone out in those added to my other curiosi
ties I vorllv believe I should never have re
turned to freedom. I wore a pair of high
boots, a mackintosh with a. cape, a cloth cap
and a walking stick.
"As I passed through the city the politer
people looked at me with an expression of
minded pitv and scorn, and the less polite
roado remarks to one anotbor in a tone of
voico that mado me think, that they must
imagine me deaf. The llttlo boys followed
me, asked me if I were a soldier, whether I
came fi om I'lccakoo county, seemed anxious
to know what was the amount of the wager,
or whether I had escaped from a side show.
Dogs barked and snarled at me, and one
went so far as to try tho taste of my boot.
Tbeunkindestcnt of all, though, was when I
readied the house I was bound for aud
found the friends I wanted to call on. I had
to undergo a regular catechism to prove that
there were nosignsofinsanity in any branch
of my family. When I had managed to es
tablish my sanity on its usual basis, I could
get them to talk of nothing but the walking
capacity qf Englishmen and women, and I
fear I only removed the suspicion of lunacy
by a conviction that I was lvlng when, in
answer to frequent questions, I emphatical
ly stated that SO miles over hill and dale was
nothing extraordinary for a day's walk."
Asked what his favorito walk was here, he
said he would tell mo about the one he had
taken oftonest, and ho launched forth ngaln:
"I havo to live down in the Eighteenth
ward because of my work, and as I have
friends in the East End, I often walk three
miles ncross Stanton avenue, becauso I need
muscular effort, and besides it's a lovely
walk and it's a bother to go around bv tho
Forks of the Road atThlrtv-fourth streo't.tis I
have to do If I want to ride. So I start up
Stanton nvenuo by the sido of the Allegheny
Cometery that's a beautiful piece of ground
and keep on till I get somewhere about the
top of Fifty-third street. There I bear off to
the left, Dy the old coal road which rejoins
the avenue at Davis' brickyards. I like best
to start about sunset time, and then,
lust before the old road breaks awav.
I turn round and look out over the
valley toward Allegheny City. The sky
Is one gorgeous red panoply, shading
off to orange or a jirimrose gold, whero It
seems to rest on the hills abovo the sister
city. Then the lights on tho eloctrio towers
flash out like so many clusters of evening
stars; nearer at hand furnaces belch forth
angry flames, while between them lies Pitts
burg outlined in dotted lines of light, and
tho river now and then looks as though
transmuted into silver; the whole pano
rama forming a picture the more delightful
for its contrasts. I sometimes think those
light towers must have been placed there as
ornaments, because I can't see how they
were ever expected to cast anything but
shadows on the streets."
"Gontoonwlth my walk I look down for
a whllo at tho glare and listen to tho noise of
the Lucy and Isabella furnaces, which seem
intensified by the evening quiet up there on
the hill. Passing a quaint old-world-looking
little schoolhouse I soon regain tho ave
nueand there I walk along for about three
quarters of a mile without much of special
interest. This part of the walk generally
makes me feel a littlesad.notwith thoughts
stirred up bv the cemetery I had passed, nor
vet with that sadness which seems Insepar
able from scenes of beauty, but with wrath
at the evidences of labor allowed to go
to wasto on the earth-covered side
walks and the rotted wooden blocks of the
roadwav. But my three-quarters of a
mile bring me to a sharp cotner of the road
where I always stay for a few minutes to
survey the surrounding country. Diroctlv
opposite me, and very little higher than I
nm, is Highland reservoir, to the left whito
cottaged Morningside nestles among its
truck gardens, to the Tight spreads out East
Liberty, botwoen mo and the reservoir is a
green valley, and beyond and slightly to the
left of Highland He the foothills of the Alle
ghenles. Another ten minutes brings me to
Negley avenue and there lam. Yon should
take that walk some time"
Overcome by his enthusiasm the writer
promised he would do it when he had time.

BE0THES DAHA PLEASE)
Witl Crisp and His Progressive Attitude
on the Tariff Question.
New York San.
Tho Speaker of tho-House of Representa
tives, the Hon. Charles Frederic Crisp, is nn'
experienced Democratic statesman, wise,
able and energetic. No candidate before the
caucus could have entertained ajnoro sin
cere and profound appreciation of the great
political responsibilities accompanying tho
honor of being chosen Speaker. No fellow
legislator possessed a more fundamental un
derstanding of the possibilities and methods
of party progress or more abiding faithful
ness to the Democratic aim and organiza
tion. It is not to be supposed, therefore, that the
Speaker, in taking his new seat with the
declaration that there was to be "no step
backward" in the effort to apply tho Demo
cratic policy to the tariff, merely uttered :v
perfunctory formula of the late campaign of
education or indulged himself for th com
fort and applause of the Mngwumpgallerv.
His words must havo had the serious mean
ing of a leader fn'ly appreciating the situa
tion to bo dealt with.
Within tlifl last 12 years, since the begin
ning of agltat'on to reiorm the tariff, tho
cause has received one tremendous and irre
sistible sockdolager in the candidacy of
Grover Cleveland. Tho offensivo absurdity
of a party binding itself to the fat person of
a revolutionary egotist doomed the enter
prise to the merer of Its enemies nnd to tho
arbitration or McKinlo v. Indirectly tho Mc
Kiniey bill is a Mugwump product. The
Cleveland movement was a step backward
with n venge.tnce.
It is a realization of this fact that lies at
the beginning of Democratic restoration.
The first stop forward toward the attain
ment of any purpose within the view of the
Democratic porty, tariff changing or reform
of any nature or extsnt,leads in the opposite
direction from the Mugwump rond to the
disaster of 88; and like all solid and earnest
Democrats, the Hon. Charles Frederic Crisp,
of Georgia, surely knows it.
WHEW CASH WEDS TITLE,
The Union Is Not Always Mercenary, and
Often Tares Oat Happily.
PAnis, Deo. 13 Miss Mitchell, daughter of
8 tnator Mitchell, of Oregon, says that her
marriage to tho Duke de la Kochefoucald
will probably take place in February.
Several prominent English and American
lawyers have recently been Interviewed
here on the snbject of international mar
riages. Henry Cachard, representing Coud
ert Brotheis, ol New York, said: "The
general opinion that such marriages are
merely exchanges of money for social posi
tion is quite a mistake. Although unions
do sometimes originate in selfish motives,
they are mostly dno to affection. Tho fact
that the ladles keep control of their money,
and that often tho men have more property
than their wives, goes far to prove this.
Such marriages have generally turned out
happily."
Ono of the legal ndvlsers of tho United
States consulate said: "In the minority of
cases the fortnnes of American ladles are-in
trust and so tied up that tho incomes alone
can be touched. Marriage with such women,
therefore, will scarcely be a bait to men
who-esole object is money. Ladies are, to a
certain degree, attractod by the glitter of a
coronet." Another said: "I think If tho
American cirl, whose notions of matrimony
have been formed at home.expects a French
husband to act np to her ideal, she Is likely
to bo disappointed: but If she understands
foreign views of marriage, and accepts a
husband, knowing these opinion?, she is
generally happy In her married life. The
fact that most American ladles before con
tracting nnions with forolzners, have trav
eled in Europe and-irot divested of the na
tional prejudices In these matters, accounts
for the greater nnmber of these marriages
resulting happily."
