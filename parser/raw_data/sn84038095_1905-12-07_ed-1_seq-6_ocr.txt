THE MESSAGE.
The whole country has been wait
ing, not with suspense, but with
eagerness, for what President Roose
velt might say in his message to the
Congress. There has been no suspense
as the President is so outspoken at all
times that the people have felt that
they knew him and that he could not
and would not fail them. No Presi
dent has had more united support
from all the people than has Mr.
Roosevelt. There is no politics in it,
no sectionalism nfne out of ten Amer
icans are proUd to say that they are
Roosevelt men. The other tenth are
I pretty careful not to say anything
about it. It will do no good for the
President's opponents to point out that
he has made mistakes. Someway the
people love him as much for his
blunders as for anything else. He is
so wholesouled in all he does that even
when he cuts through the red tape as
he has perhaps done in the case of
San Domingo, the people are with
him. Nothing can defeat Roosevelt
with the people, and nothing can de
feat the Republican party if it stands
by Roosevelt's politics. Republican
municipal politics may be rotten in
Philadelphia and Cincinnatti, but the
faith in the President not only sur
vives but is stengthened. He is a
million votes stronger than his party
today and his party is a-million votes
stronger than any other party.
The President's message is a second
proclamation of emancipation it is
even more important than that sacred
instrument because we believe it will
bring about industrial freedom for all
the people rather than for a part of
them.
THE MILL RE-OPENED.
The Luaey mills have at last started
with.Mr. Wm. H. Ru'e as manager. Ev
erything hasjbeen putin first-class con
dition and the mill is now on the mar
ket for grain and has on hand a supply
of flour and feed of all kinds. Abetter
manager than Mr. Rule could not have
been selected by the owners, as he le
well known by the farmers as a man
of sterling integrity and one who knows
the milling business from the ground
up. The concern will be known as the
Denison Mill and Elevator Co and it
aaks its share of the public patronage.

THE NEW LEGISLATUTE.
According the Register and Leader
there is a great deal of hard work
ahead of the next legislature. It
gives a list of a dozen important
measures and many minor ones, which
will demand the attention of the Sol
ons.
First and foremost it names the,
primary election law. This is a mat
ter in which we of Crawford are not
greatly interested It may be of vital
importance in cities like Des Moines
but in a rural county such as this the
people get pretty nearly what they
want under the present system. While
then, in theory we favor such a law we
are not greatly interested one way or
the other.
As to an educational board of con
trol, the second on the Register list.
It would be a wise measure, always
providing that it is not in any way
mixed up with the board of control
having charge of our other institutions.
The railroad anti-pass bill should
become a law. There is absolutely no
defense to be made for it and we be
lieve the railroads themselves would
welcome it if assured that no other
road would gain advantage.
The pure food law is important and
should be made as drastic as possible.
It should also be made to include pat
ent medicines compelling manufactures,
to have their formulae approved by a
state board of chemists before they
can be placed on sale.
Child labor is a matter of minor
importance because the evil is not
great in Iowa. A sanitarium for con
sumptives is a question of paternal
ism, just how far the state should go.
in such matters is difficult to decide.
The reformatory is an imperative
necessity. It is a crime to herd young
first offenders with hardened criminate
of the most degenerate type as is now
done at our penitentiaries.
The abolition of the lobbyis non
sense. If the legislators need to have
their morals protected by a legal chest
pad of this character they better stop
at home. The lobby has a legitimate
place. If Denison's interests were
affected and'we wished to send a com
mittee to Des Moines, we should have
the privilege to send our delegation
and they should be privileged to urge
th'-ir views on the members at any
time or place. The same right be
longs to the private individual or to
the corporation. Bribery is another
matter and should be sternly dealt
with. No right-minded, God-fearing,
honest legislator need be afraid of the
lobby, and the people should send no
other kind.
The present mulct law is working so
satisfactorily in so large a porportiou
of the state that we would decry any
agitation of the question, either by a
Marshal Law" or any other innova
tion. In Denison, for instance, we do
not believe the operation of the law
could be improved.
The term of office should be adjust
ed to the bienniel elections amend
ment. We favor the four year term,
it is none too long, and the election of
an absolutely new set of officers every
two years is fraught with grave dan
ger.
It would be entirely possible under
the present arrangement for every
county officer to be in the hands of a
new and inexperienced man at one and
the same time.
The "wage exemption law" is an
other measure mentioned. We confess
that we do not know exactly what is
intended, but we do know that the
present exemptions together with the
bankruptcy law are already working a
hardship upon many who deserve cred
it and who would otherwise receive it,
and has inflected severe losses on mer
chants and business men. It is often
pointed out that nine-tenths of the
business of the county is done on cred
it. It is therefore of immense im
portance that Credit'' be protected
as well as the wage earner.
The state certification of all teach
ers is impracticable and would be a
farce or a nuisance.
The Washington correspondents,
who lust week predicted a hot contest
and an uncertain outcome in the rail
way regulation movement before con
gress, this week say the friends of the
president's program are convinced that
the fight is won, and all is over but the
shouting. Doubtless the truth lies
between the two statement?. Bnt we
a a re in be ha
after proper discussion the people
would demand and secure through
congress the one thing the president
has insisted on, viz: That some gov
ernment body should be given power
to correct an unjust rate, aud the bur
den of appeal should be placed on the
railroad instead of on the shipper. It
is right that this should be insisted or,
not because {Jit will remedy all ret-s
evils, for it will nob: but because so
much railway power is now centered
in thp hands of a few men that the
right of the government to some sort
of direct authority oyer rates must be
established without question. This is
a distinct departure from. previous
methods, but it is not revolutionary or
socialistic, as some of the railroad jn
terests would have us believe. Rate
regulation Is coming.—Rockwell City
Advocate.

The plan to be installed on the Oma
ha division, according to present plans
and speci6cations, will like the Dubu
que division equipment, make colli
sions next to impossible. The lines
will be divided into a certain number
of "blocks" each equipped with a tele
graph instrument and several lock sem
aphores. The semaphores will be on
the interlocking plan, and the tower
man will be absolutely unable to allow
two trains in any block at the same
time. It will be impossible to show a
clearance In the semaphore until the
operator has received word from the
man in the next tower that the train'
that was in the block has left. The
plan is an up to date one, nsed on
many of the leading roads of the coun-
try. fv
