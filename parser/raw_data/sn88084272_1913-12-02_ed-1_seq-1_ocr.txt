SAYS
President Declares Mexican Provisional President the
Only Cloud Upon the Horizon of the United States
and That He Must Be Removed Urges!
Steps to Prevent Private Monopoly,
and Rural Credit for Farmers.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec 2. "There is but one cloud upon our
horizon. That has shown itself to the south of us, and hangs over
Mexico. There can be no certain prospect of peace in America until Gen.
Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority in Mexico; until it is understood
on all hands, indeed, that such pretended governments will not be countenanced
or dealt with by the government of the United States."
This is the way president Woodrow Wilson deals with the Mexican
situation, in his message to congress, read in person before that body today.
Continuing, he says:
"We are the friends of constitutional government in America; we are
more than its friends, we are its champions; because in no other way can our
neighbors, to whom we would wish in every way to make proof of our friend
ship, work out their own development in peace alid liberty. Mexico has no
government. The attempt to maintain one at the City of Mexico has broken
down, and a mere military despotism has been set up which has hardly
more than the semblance of national authority. It originated in the usurpation
of Victoriano Huerta, who, after a brief attempt to play the part of constitu
tional president, has at last cast aside even the pretense of legal right and de
clared higiself dictator.
"As a consequence, a condition of affairs now exists in Mexico which
has made it doubtful whether even the most elementary and fundamental rights
either of her own people or of the citizens of other countries resident within
her territory can long be successfully safeguarded, andwhich threatens, if long
continued, to imperil the interests. of peace, order, and tolerable life in the lands
immediately to the south of us.
"Even if the usurper had succeeded in his purposes, in despite of the con
stitution of the republic and the rights of its people, he would have set up
nothing but a precarious and hateful power, which could have lasted but a
little while, and whose eventual downfall would have left the country in a
more deplorable condition than ever. But he has not succeeded. He has for
feited the respect and the moral support even of those who were at one time
willing to see him succeed. Little by little he has been completely isolated.
By a little every day his power and prestige are crumbling and the collapse is
not far away.
"We shall not, I believe, be obliged to alter our policy of watchful
waiting. And then, when the end comes, we shall hope to see constitutional
crder restored m distressed Mexico by the concert and energy of such of her
leaders as prefer the liberty of their people to their own ambitions."
President "Wilson, rend his messaged
to congress at a Joint session ol both
branches, at 1 o'clock In the house
chamber. The message, among the
briefest documents of Its kind from
any president, about 3000 word. long,
required less than 30 minutes for read
ing, though it treated .upon a variety
of subjects.
Galleries packed with a brilliant
ffompnny of officials and their fami
lies greeted the president -when the
Joint session got down to business.
All present stood and a deafening roar
of applause swept the chamber as Mr.
Wilson took his place behind the desk
and began to read at 1:0S o'clock. The
president read easily and clearly in
his usual pleasing tone, which 'carried
his words to the doors of the chamber.

.Villa's Chief of Staff and
Several Friends Come to
El Paso Side.
VILLA SAYS THEY
GOT, HIS MONEY
JUAN N. MEDINA, chief of staff of
Gen. Pancho Villa, is in the EI
Paso county jail, charged with
bringing stolen property over the value
of $50 Into the state. The complaint
was fijed in the court of justice of
the peace E. B. McClintock Tuesday
morning, following which Medina was
transferred from the city jail by dep
uty constable J. W. Brown, to the
county jail. t
In the complaint signed ty city de
tective Fred Delgado. it Is charged that
the defendant had taken $7000 gold,
and $14,000 Mexican money, the per
sonal property of "Villa. Medina de
clares that the charges are false and
were trumped up by enemies.
Medina was arrested at 604 Upson
avenue Monday night at 7:45 o'clock
by chief of detectives Jesse C. Stan
sel Detectives N. Wood and O. W.
Smith were with Stansel. The money
claimed to have been takn has not been
located.
Medina was arrested-by Stansel on
a cotnplaint charging him with a viola
tion of the neutrality laws.
Villa Causes Arrest.
According to detective Stansel, Villa
telephoned him at 5:30 o'clock Mon- i
day afternoon and Requested mm to
come to Juarez. "Through an inter
preter," said Stansel, "Villa told me
that Juan Medina had skipped out with
something like $14,000, gold. He said
.that It was Impossible to ascertain the
exact amount, as every paper which
had been kept by Medina in his office
had either been destroyed or had in
some way disappeared. Medina, Villa
said, had received the money in the
nature of hospital funds. It had been
sent to Juarez from Sonora. and was
intended to be expended in taking care
of the, wounded and sick rebel sol
'dlers. "The missing money. Villa told me.
was "all in currency, ranging in $20
bills to $100 bills. There were one or
two $1,000 bills in the lot.
"When I arrived at the house on
Upson avenue, Medina was there. Sev
eral Mexicans were there and there
were four or five women in the house."
YillR.ilnyTe.tIfy,
The date of the examining trial be
fore Judge McClintock has not been
set. There is talk of trying to get the
war department to allow Villa to come
to this side to testify in the case when
it comes up for trial. This would be
in the nature of granting Villa im
munity from arrest if the plan is car
ried out.
Capt. Harry N. Cootes came to the
police station Tuesday morning when
he was notified of Medina's arrest, but
Medina had been turned over to the
county officers.
The report is that Medina became
more or less angry when it was an
nounced by Villa that he would be
taken to the front anl Lieut. Col. Me
dina Veytia would be left in charge
at Juarez. Citizens of Juarez, it is,
said, circulated a petition requesting
that Medina be allowed to remain.
Villa declined and ordered Medina to
go to the front.
Following this. It Is said that Me
dina came to El Paso. After havingH
I reached this side the detectives say
mai lie wroie out ms resignation ana
sent it to Juarez. This is denied by
Medina's friends, it being said that be
fore leaving Juarez, Medina wrote his
resignation and sent it by a messenger
to Villa.
Others Are Missing.
"I was not in hiding at all." said
Medina. "I came to El Paso as a pri
vate citizen, having resigned from the
army. I was not discharged. The
charge that I have stolen any prop
erty is absolutely false. That is a
put up job."
Following the disappearance of Me
dina from Juarez, Capt. Jose Covarru
blas. Lauro Hurtado and twl Ameri
cans, Capts. Holmdahl and Poole, are
said to have come to this side of the
river. All were close friends of Villa,
It Is said that Covarrublas, who is a
brother of one of Carranza's cabinet
officers, has gone to Hermosillo to
thresh out the whole matter with Car
ranza. Gets Medina's Job.
J,Ieut CoL Medina Veytia has been
appointed chief of staff to Villa to
take the place made vacant by the de
parture from Juarez of Medina.
Jose Velarde has been appointed
mayor of Juarez. Mr. Velarde was
made "presldente municipal" when the
rebels first occupied the border town,

REBELS SEIZE STUFF
FROM JUAREZ OWNERS
THREE wholesale commission warehouses, the property of Spaniards, Manuel
and Domingo Trueba and E. Canalles, have been seized by the rebels
in Juarez. Thousands of dollars' worth of stock, groceries and clothing,
is said to have been storedin the warehouses when the rebels took possession.
Ike Alderete has lost his keno concession. By order of Gen. Villa, it was
transferred to A. Kyriacopulas Monday. The rebels claim that Alderete owes
taxes for a year on his concession and until he pays them he will not be allowed
to run the game as his own property.

$5,000,000 IN CASH;
CHIHUAHUA DESERTED
Five million pesos, or more than $2,000,000 gold, the property of Gen. Luis Terrazas, aged Chihuahua multi
millionaire, is 'being carried overland from the city, of Chihuahua to the American border by a federal army of 1500
men under Gen. Salvador1 Mercado, who evacuated the staate capital Sunday morning and struck out for the border
village of Ojinaga, according to word received Monday afternoon by Gen. Pancho Villa, at Juarez. The aged gen
eral and many relatives, who have been virtual prisoners in the capital for six months, are with the federals, it is reported.

ernor of the state, with 2007" federal
troops, had left on foot for Ojinaga, on
the United States border, 90 miles from
Marfa, Texas; that generals Jose Ynez
Salazar and Pascual Orozco, with more
than 1000 federals, had retreated to the
mountains west of Chihuahua city, and
that hundreds of civilians, including
women and children, who were on the
verge of starvation, had started out to
walk to the United States border.
City "Well Fortified.
Besides being the capital of the state.
Chihuahua, with a population normally
of 35,000, is the metropolis of northern
Mexico. Neither in the Madero revo
lution nor in the present uprising has
Chihuahua been taken from the fed
erals. Its garrison and the command
ing positions for sharpshooters and
machine guns afforded by the cathe
dral and public buildings, heretofore
had presented a formidable barrier to
invaders. Had the rebels reached the
city and the federals resisted, it was
believed that a fight in the city would
have resulted in great loss of life and
property.
Viaduct Reported Destroyed.
Conditions in the city were said to be
such that life there was no longer en
durable. The Spanish viaduct, which
conveyed water from the mountains,
was reported to have been destroyed
and the food supplies exhausted.
Gen. Villa last night telegraphed de
tails of the evacuation to Venustiano
Carranza, at Hermosillo, stating that
tne proposed advance of the rebels
southward to Mexico City would now
be expedited. The possession of the
city, he said, would make rebel terri
tory of the country straight through to
Zacatecas and operations would begin
about that city and at Aguascalientes.
Many Prominent Families Besieged.
Among the besieged citizens at Chi
huahua who are now believed to be
seeking refuge elsewhere were Juan
Creel, a banker and relative of En
rique Creel, former supporter of presi
dent Diaz: Gen. Luis Terrazas, exgov
ernor, and Albert Terrazas, a wealthy
landowner and son of the general.
Gen. Villa said Federlco Moye, promi
nent merchant, had been named civil
governor of Chihuahua state, his se
lection being based on the belief that
he would be acceptable to the rebels.

clined to say definitely but said that

would continue briskly.
Mexico City In a Month.
"We will be shooting at the ram
parts of Mexico City within a month,"
said Villa. "We are confident that
when the people in the capital realize
that we have captured almost all the
north and are in sight of the city's
gates, they will voice their feelings
which they are now afraid to do and
will clamor for the downfall of the
usurper. A mob in the capital can
oust Huerta in a day."

According to late reports which Villa
said he had received by couriers who

tion of Chihuahua by fderals was
brought about by the pressure of the

News of the evacuation and flight
in the form of a telegram from Gen. Maclovio Herrera at Villa Ahnmafa, on
the Mexican Central railway, 83 miles south of Juarez.
Herrera's telegram read: "I have the honor to report to yon that couriers
arriving here from the south report that the enemy has evacuated the state
capital and is retreating along the road that leads to Ojinaga. The evacuation
took place Sunday morning. I am informed that the strength of the enemy is
only 1500 men."
To Occupy Capital. a '
On receipt of this me3sager Gen. Villa
ordered Herrera, -who commands the
rebel army advance guard of 3590 men,
to 'continue his march south and take
possession of the capital. By Tuesday
night, according to Gen. Villa, the cav
alry column under Herrera will have
arrived at Moctezuma, 85 miles north
of Chihuahua.
"Will you send a force out to Inter
cept the Federals?" was the question
asked Villa Tuesday morning. "I do
not think it wise to disclose my mili
tary plans, but you can say that the
Huertistas will probably not reach the
border without a fight," Villa replied.
"I have no way of knowing the exact
location of the federal column today,
but I judge that they are not more
than 75 miles from Chihuahua, as they
will not be able to move fast, ham
pered by provision trains and refugee
noncombatants," he continued.
Ojinaga is about 180 miles northeast
of Chihuahua and is near the boundary
line 30 miles south of Marfa, Texas. It
takes four or five days to ride from the
capital to the border.

chant of Chihuahua, -was appolntecL
goVernor of the state ad interim by
Mercado. when he departed, according
to word received by Villa. When he
heard that Moye had been appointed
governor, he smiled and said, 'Moye is
a friend of mine."
Accompanying the Federal column, it
is reported, are 50 or 60 Chihuahua
families of the upper class. "We have
been told," said Villa Tuesday morn
ing, "that the retreating column is
more than twoVmiles long. Vehicles of
every description are being used to
convey the families who accompany
the Huertistas. Three or feur hundred
women and children are fleeing wilh
the federals. Of course, if my men
intercept the enemy, we will see that
the noncombatants are not placed in
any danger."
Promises Trains to Torreon.
"Within 10 days regular train service
will be resumed on the Mexican Central
railway from Juarez to Torreon," said
Villa Tuesday morning. Our forces
contrpl the entire territory now
from the border to Torreon and we are
going to repair the railway as soon as
possible."
In case this prediction is made good,
Torreon will be in touch with the
border at Juarez for the first time In
many months. Torreon is 527 miles
from Juarez and is one of the most im
portant mining towns in northern Mex
ico. It is the feeding point for mines
and smelters representing investments
of millions of dollars. A food famine
is said to have threatened the inhabi
tants of the city for several weeks, as
the presence of federal troops at Chi
huahua prevented supplies being
shipped in.

Officials here received informa

It was believed that this had given rise
to the reports from Juarez last night
that the two west coast towns had

and the point where Villa's advance

direct communication with the capital
is possible. The railway between Juar

their troops, but struck out for the
Guerrero district of western Chihuahua
and are heading for the Sierra Madre

ports current among rebel officers in
Jaurez. If this is true, the Huerta
followers are in for a hard time, ac

More Cavalry to Move.
One thousand cavalry will be sent
south from Juarez Tuesday afternoon
or Wednesday to Join Gen. Herrera's
column, according to Gen. Villa. When
this force leaves it -will make a total
of 4500 man who have left Juarez for
Chihuahua since last Saturday. Ap
proximately 2500 soldiers will still re
main in the border town after the de
parture of the 10. Although no ac
knowledgement was made officially, it
is rumored that the sending of these
troops south is merely a preliminary
step in a plan to meet the federal col
umn retreating northward.
Supplies sufficient to last an army
of 8000 or 9000 men for two months
are being gathered in Juarez and sent
south as fast as the railway la fully
repaired. Hundreds of sacks of flouT.
beans and coffee, besides thousands of
loaves of bread, have been shipped
south to feed Gen. Herrera'a column
and more are being imported into Jua
rez daily.

of the Constitutionalist government,"
said Pancho Villa, Tuesday morning; at
his headquarters on Calle Lerdo. "It is.

It is just as probable that the Clty
of Chihuahua will be made th.a capital,"
he added.
