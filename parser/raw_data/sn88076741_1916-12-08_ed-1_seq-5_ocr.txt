Washington, Nov. 28»—A new psltt
•of government railroad regulation,
based on constructive- principles, of
helpfulness and encouragement Instead
of upon principles of repression and
punishment, was urged by Alfred P.
Thom, counsel ifor the-Hallway Btsecu
tlves* Advisory Committee, the first
witness on behalf ot. the railroads be
fore the Newiands. Joint Committee on
Interstate Commerce, which has instl
tnted a general lnqalry Into the prob
lems 'of railroad regulation.
"It is proposed by. the joint, resolu
tion of Congress," said Mr. Thom, "to
go Into a comprehensive study of the
whole subject of transportation, to
make a new: assessment, after 29 years,
«f experiment, of Its history, its pres..
«nt conditions, and its future need&.
The railroads accept the vfew that reg
ulation Is- a permanent and enduring
part of government in America aw*
that the flrst duty of the carriers la to
the pwhilo That duty Is to. afford
reasonable facilities on reasonable
terms and a* reasonable rates, and'this
must be-douc before any private inter
ests «an- be considered."
Certainty, Safety' and Sufficiency.
,Mnc Thom contendted that the. seal in
terest: of the public is in being assured
of oertainty, safety and sufficiency of
transportation facilities, rather than in
rat«»8i The first consideration of the
E»iilHte is to obtain transport&feton faclli
NtfSv What the eost Is, Is. in reality a
*«Mid consideration, he saM.
51 r. Thom proposed' aa increase of
iransportatlon facilities, as a method
t»f securing- relief from, the high cost:
of living. "There have been less thai*
1 JHio miles of new ratiroad constrwt
••il in tiie United States during the past
rear," he said, "less than In any year
since 1848, except tbe period of the
Civil War, and yet the cost of living Is
daily advancing, ttwtng to a shortage of
supplies which might be remedied by
securing acce&s to new areas of pro
duction.
Credit Must Be Improved.
"This leads to the consideration as to
whether railroad credit is as good as
the public interest requires. It is Im
possible for railroads to earn enough
to supply the necessary new facilities
from current revenue. They must be
provided front credit. Investors can
not be coerced, but must be attracted."
Among, the Conditions affecting rail
road credit which deter investors he
mentioned the following:
"First, Railroad revenues are not
controlled by Investors, but are fixed
and limited hy governmental authority
and .not by one but by several govern
mental authorities, which do not recog
nize responsibility for assured results
.•o investors and are uncoordinated.
'•Second, Railroads cannot control
and the government cannot and does
not limit the expense account
"Third, The present system of regn

and correction and not on
a

Washington, NOT. 20.—Ten members
of Congress, five Senators and five
members of the House-of Representa
tlves, began here today an inquiry Into
the. subject oC. public eontrol and su
pervision of railroads t&at m&j lead to
the-revolutlonising of the whole scheme
of governmental regulation of the coua
trp'si transportation Incidentally
the- committer is to look into the ques
tion of government ownership' of rail
wagrs, telephone sndt telegnph. Unes
and ezpiess companies.
The members ot. the committee

veatigationa are Senator Kewlanda of
Nevada, chairman Senators Robinson
of Arkansas, Undenwoodl of Alabama*.
Cummins, of Iowai and Brandegee of
Connecticut* and Representativea AA

Cullop of' Indiana, Esch- of V^isconsin
and Hamilton
ott

quiry was recommended by President
Wilson in his message to Gangress in
December of last year. described,
as its purpose to determine what could
be gone "for bettering the conditions
under which'the railroads-are operated
and tor making them moee useful secv
antSiOf the country as a whole."
Prominent Men as. Witneaaea.
In order to obtain the views of all
interests, affected by the operations of
the. transportation lines the committee
has invited prominent shippers,
ens, representatives, of commercial or
ganizations, railway executives, econo
mists and others to. appear before them
The first to be heard are railroad
commissioners
oS
various states who
began their evidence today. Their
testimony is directed chiefly to oppos
ing any enlargement of the federal
authority over commerce that would
detract from the powers now exercised
by state bodies. They will be followed
shortly by officials of railway labor
organizations who are expected to reg
ister their opposition to the increase
of governmental authority over wages
and conditions of labor.
Chief interest in the bearings cen
ters in tbe proposals that will be put
forward by representatives of the rail
roads, for it is reported that they wi!l
advocate an extension of federal au
thority over rates and securities to the
practical exclusion of state control of
these matters. It is understood also that
they will go on record in favor of fed
eral Incorporation of all railroad lines
Legislative Program ef Railroad*.
Prom an authoritative aource is ob
tained the following outline of the leg
islative program which the railroads
will ask the committee to consider in
its investigation: Tbey will endeavor
to demonstrate to tbe commission that
one of the principal defects in the pres
ent system of railroad regulation is
the lack of coordination resulting from
the simultaneous and conflicting regu
lation by tbe federal government and
by the 48 statea. They will, therefore,
ask that entire governmental control
of the rates and practices of Interstate
carriers, except purely local matters,
be plsced in the hands of a federal
body so that interstate traffic may be
regulQteg without reference to state
lines, leaving to the state commissions
Jurisdiction only over local matters and
local public utilities. As a part of this
plsn, compulsory system of federal
Incorporation is to be recommended,
accompanied by federal supervision of
cgflroad stock and bond Issues.
reorganisation of the Interstate
Comtiterce Commission will be asked.
In order to enable tbe commission prop
erly to exercise Its increased powers.
It Is also pfoposed that the preparation
and prosecution of cases sgalnst the
railroads pfceft be delegated to some
other agenc? the government, possi

Not According
to Law
By ETHEL HOLMES
Fnedl Boynton and his dog Bob were
inseparable. Fred was engaged to
Whinie Douglas, much to Bob's dis
comdture. The lovers did not hide
their caresses from the dog, who gave
every evideu of jealousy. Some
times they caressed on purpose to see
the dog. show his distress. Bob didn't
show his teeth and growl he was too
respectable a dog for that. He looked
up at them pitifully,, whined and wag
ged* his tail in a melancholy fashion.
Wlleu. Winnie was a little girl she
as permitted to play with a boy
named Joe Dixon, a neighbor, tbe son
of. parents of low degree: By and by
she went away to school and when
she- returned she was of an age to un
derstand' the difference between th»
Dixon family and her own. So she
dropped Joe. From, that time till Win
nie became engaged to Fred whenever
J«e met her be greeted her with a
malicious look. He- was now a man
igrown*. and she was: a woman.
One. dhy Bob came to Winnie in a
most deplorable- condition. He had
been cut in many places with a knife,
but seemed to be troubled about some
thing else. Winnie, endeavored to bind
up* his wounds, but he would not per
mit. He kept moving away from her
and: barking till she was convinced that
he wished her to follow him, and she
did1 so. He led her to.
a lonely place In a
rood, where she found her lover dea^
badly cut like the dog.
There was absolutely no clew as to
how Fred Boynton eame to his end,
but it was evident from his cuts and
those of his dog. that he had been at
tacked and that Bob had attempted to
defend him.
The only person who believed that
she could point out the murderer "was
Winifred Douglas, but she said not a
word of this to any one. To rnairp
a
charge without the slightest proof
would avail nothing. She adopted Bob,
and the two mourned together, tho
dog's jealousy being turned to affec
tion by a common grief.
When the murder occurred Joe Dixon
was not at home. At any rate, he was
understood not to be at home. Wini
f*ed did not meet him for some months
after the murder. Then, seeing him
coming toward her on the street, sh»
fixed her eyes upon his face scrutiniz
ing^"- She thought she saw several
scars on it JTe did not look at her.
They had not spoken since Winnie bad
gone away to school. ,He was evident
ly very much affected by the meeting
and hurried by.
Winnie had a plan for fixing her lov
er's killing on Dixon—not sufficient evi
dence to convict him. but to remove
all doubt as to his criminality. She
told the chief of police her story, and
Dixon was arrested and charged with
the crime. At Winifred's suggestion
the prisoner's face and hands were ex
amined with a magnifying glass and
found to be covered with scars, scarce
ly visible to the naked eye. There
was nothing in this alone to indicate
bis guilt, but Winifred was not relying
on it alone.
The police were much averse to Dix
on's arrest and declared that they wero
not responsible for it. averring that
they were gathering evidence that
would surely convict another person
of the crime, that Dixon was charged
with. When Winifred insisted that
Joe be brought to trial tbey demurred
unless 6he would openly charge him
with the murder. To this she consent
ed, and the case came to trial.
Winifred was the only important wit
ness. The prisoner sat regarding bet
with an unintelligible stare. Hef seem
ed puzzled to know what she was go
ing to do with him. When she took
the witness box and began the' story
which had been told her every one
watched and listened to her intently.
She made an excellent impression.
When she came to tbe story of Bob'*
coming to her badly cut tbe courtroom
was profound by silence, except for
her voice. Here she stopped, and thosa
who had exsmlned tbe prisoner's face
and hands testified that tbey were
scarred.
"May It please the court," said tbe
prosecuting attorney, "the next witness
is a dog."
In obedience to a message, a servant
In tbe Douglas family -entered. leatfr
tng a handsome collie. He, came vn
wfRtngly, looking" fhnWiy at- those
gathered in the room. Presently catch
ing sight of W|nifrisd, he sprsnft to
ward her, but he was held In leash tilt
his eye eanght eight of tbe prisoner,
who s*t pale as desth regarding him.
Then tbe dog gavt a growl and a.
spring toward Dixon. He was sufferedl
to go fr« and in another moment wav
tearing Dixqn'a neckwear, endeavoring
to get bis teeth in his throat
This was enough. He was torn «\»ny
and taken out of the courtroom.
Tbe prosecutor rested bis ease. Tta
counsel for the defense aummed pp l^
a half hearted way. He did opt be
lieve that a verdict based on .mtcjph eff-'
dencc would stand, but.be knew that
every person in court bellevjg' In biw
client's guilt. The judges instructed
the Jury that so long as there was uo
witness of tbe (Time and not even r-ir
cumstantliti evidence Involving a hu
man being they could not convict the
prisoner. Nevertheless tbey brought
iu a disagreement
Dixon was not tried again, but so,:
soon as be was released be left tbe
place and' never returned. Winifred
never married. She kept Bob with he*
till he died of old age. and whea he
died she grieved for him aa If he had
been human.
