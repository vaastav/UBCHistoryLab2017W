tho Delaware Capes, distress signals
were sent out. They were answered by
the steamship Philadelphia, which found
the Jones with her hold half full of
water, her crew with life belts on and
the lifeboats over the side. It was re
ported that one of her seacocks had been
damaged and that a machinist's mate
had been put In Irons.
Temporary repairs were made and the
Jones started to Philadelphia. Upon her
arrival ahe began to settle and another
examination revealed that several sea
cocks had been opened.

I'ktrckira!), Dec. 7 ( Delayed). To
day for the first time since the war
beirnn not a single shot was fired on the
Hussion front -from the Hlack Sea to

DEMANDS ALLIES' AIMS.
Trotsky Insists German Armies Be
Not Moved to Other Fronts.
London, Dec. I. A RusslanGovern
ment despatch, dated Thursday and re
ceived here by wireless, announces that
Leon Trotsky, the Bolshevik Foreign
Minister, has sent to all tho allied em
bassies and legations in Petrcgrad a
note intimating that the armistice ne.
gotlatlona with the Central Powers have
been suspended for a week at the Initia
tive of the Russian delegation for the
purpose of providing opportunity of in
forming the peoples and the Govern
ments of the allied countries of the exist
ence of such negotiations and their ten
dency. The note adds that the armistice will
be signed only on condition that troops
will not be transferred from one front to
another and that German troops' are
cleared from the islands around Moon
Sound. It concludes:
"The period of delsy thus given, even
In the existing disturbed conditions of
International communication, is amply
sufficient to afford the allied govern
ments opportunity to define their attl.
tude toward the peace negotiations, that
Is, their willingness or refusal to par
ticipate in negotiations for an armistice
and peace.
"In case of refusal they must declare
clearly and definitely before all mankind
the alms for which the peoples of Kurope
may be called to shed their blood during;
the fourth year of the war."
M. Karakhan, a member of the Rus
sian armistice delegation, who remains
In Brest-Lltovak, reports the Germans
will make only such transfer of troops
as were ordered before December 5.
Members of the AH Russian Commis
sion to deal with the elections to the
Constituent Assembly have been ar
rested by the Bolshevlkl, a Reuter des
patch from Petrograd says. Lenlne.
Tiotxky and tho other Maximalist lead
ers have appointed Moses Urltxky Com
missioner for Elections to the Constitu
ent Assembly, with virtually autocratic
powers.
The Germans, It Is added, have
warned Itusslan aviators distributing
Maximalist proclamations that they will
be shot If captured.
In reiterating his former statement
that regenerative processes sre going on
In Russia the Petrograd correspondent
of the Jfominp Post says:
"The real Russia Is silently and
steadily working for reconstruction and
the Inevitable return to common sense,
which we may hope Is nesr at hand."
He adds that the Bolshevik! now are
belnar challenged by an organisation
calling Itself the Union of Anarchist'
Syndicalists.

"The enemy'.i artillery activity during

Distinct satisfaction was felt alonT

As lonir as the British artillery Is
able to cotitlnuc tho heavy bombard
