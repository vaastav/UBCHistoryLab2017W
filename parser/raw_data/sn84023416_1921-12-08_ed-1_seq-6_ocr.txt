DENVER. A platinum and gold
medal set with a ruby measuring
half an inch in diameter and car
rying an insurance value of $10,000,
has just been received from the Jap
anese emperor by Jacob Berry, a
resident of Denver for 14 years, for
meritorious service with the Twenty
seventh infantry in Siberia. This
honor, which signifies the Order of
the Rising Sun, is believed to be held
by only three other Americans, Gen
eral Wood, who received his emblem
last week, Genral Morrow, and Ma
jor Miller. A translation of the Jap
anese citation received with the medal
reads :

parole by marrying the daughter of the
former warden of the prison, Elmer
Inman is placing hope that his shat
tered love romance will be restored
through executive clemency.
His bride of six weeks, a prominent
society girl and social welfare worker,
was formerly Miss Lavona Codding
tou, daughter of J. K. Coddlngton, as
sistant state attorney general and un
til lust spring, the warden of the peni
tentiary. The marriage was revealed when In
man again was placed in prison. He
began serving a sentence of from ten
to twenty years in the prison In 1910
for a $20,000 diamond robbery at
Arkansas City. As trusty he served
as chauffeur for the warden's family
and the love romance then began.
Last summer he was paroled, and
one of the conditions of a Kansas
prison parole forbids marriage during
the parole period. Inman, however,
met Miss Coddlngton at Bartlesvllle,
Okla., and the marriage was performed.
The honeymoon came to smash a

The Twenty-seventh Infantry was
closely associated with the Japanese
In the first advance from Vladivostok
to Irkutsk, a distance of about 2,000
miles through Rolshevik territory. It
was during this advance that the ser
vice of Captain Berry was brought to
the attention of the Japanese govern
ment, which in recognition of his ser
vices presents him with this medal.
The duties of Captain Berry, who
served as supply officer, were par
ticularly difficult on account of being
off from the American base of sup
plies, and troops were forced to live
on the country, the supply of food
still being very scarce. The American
troops stood the rigors of two Si
berian winters where the thermom
eter often registered GO below zero,
without much discomfort.
Captain Berry, who served through
the Spanish-American war, re-enlisted
in the army in 1012 at Fort Logan. From
that time on he was In California, the
Hawaiian islands, the Philippines, and
Japan. He received his order to Si
beria from Tien Tsin, China.
Captain Berry was married recently

The romance was the third for

of criminal procedure had been amend
ed so as to include men as well as
women under the head of "vagrants."
In his decision, which filled twenty
pages, Magistrate Ryttenberg contend
ed that the testimony of the two po
licemen, who found the banker scantily
garbed with the two young women, did
not indicate a violation of Section 887,
Subdvlsion 4, of the code, with which
Breitung was charged.
"The intention of the legislature, It
would seem from a careful reading of
this statute," the court ruled, "was to
classify and punish as vagrants per
sons of both sexes who either did noth
ing to earn a living or who earned
their living in a disreputable way.
Those who violate Clause F, Subdi
vision 4, are those who assist or take
part in the business of procuring
people for Indecent acts. The statute
does not concern Itself with people who
have reputable employment and do not

IN EVENING gowns the designer has
a choice of silhouettes, and often
his fancy lightly turns from
long, slender lines to those that are
bouffant. Fashion Insists upon the
slim 6llhouette for fluytime dresses,
but says "what you will" for evening;
the inclination Is usually toward slen
derness. Whichever silhouette is chos
en, the maker of evening frocks may
give them any flavor he will. They
may be brilliant and stately, or friv
olous if they have "a grace in being
gay" or they may be satisfied with
unpretentious prettiness.

WASHINGTON. The whole world
needs "tuning up," according to
President Harding. The Presi
dent has the distinction of sending the
first message around the world by
radio, and he found that the methods
of radio transmission hold a lesson.
A radio outfit was set up In the
White House to connect with the new
transmission station at Jefferson, L.
I., and the President opened the switch
which, set In action this station, which
is capable of communication with 27
other stations scattered over the globe.
After turning the switch, the Presi
dent stood up while a radio operator
"tuned up" his Instrument prepara
tory to sending a message from the
President around the world.
"Just what are you doing?" the
President asked the operator.

the President's park on Seventeenth

James Madison.

of New York, the erection of the struc

In April, 1001, at a cost of $700,000. It
is built of Vermont marble and in de

the classic buildings erected during
the American Revolutionary period. It
Is a fit companion of its neighboring
structures, the Pan-American and Red
Cross buildings.
Many of the rooms and portions of
the building are the gifts of or were
furnished by individual chapters of
the national society. For example, the
spacious entrance hall is the gift of
the Pennsylvania chapter. In niches,
forming the frieze are marble statues
of Revolutionary heroes from several
states. A north and south staircase,
both memorial gifts, lead above to the

Half Billion Bushels Too Much Corn
ACCORDING to the ogrlcultural ex

ation Is the presence of some half
billion bushels which the furmer does
not know what to do with. After do
mestlc consumption, foreign demand,
hog feeding, cattle raising and other
outlets ure tuken care of, the half bil
lion bushels loom as a surplus which
keeps dragging down the price.
Corn exports are bucking up and
have been all year, according to the
foreign trade tables. In the nine
months ending with September, corn
erports were 105,000,000 bushels. This
Is compared with only 11,000,000
bushels In the first cine months of
1020.
The statisticians of the National
City bank of New Tork estimate that
the total corn exports for the calendar
year 1021 will be the lurgest la 20
years.
But the demnnd la not enough to
eat up the surplus. The American
Federation of Farm Bureaus has com

astern, of 2,500 horsepower each, are
of the sis-cylinder type, and are con

By combining the main and forward
