Mr. Catchlngs now has a ohanco to show what
lio can do. and his friends prodlct that
' ho will make a name and famo for
himself in tho House. '.Tho bollof that Mr.
Springer would bo tho first man named on the

It Is usual to stvo this place to tho Chairman ot
the Committee on Wars and Means, a placo for

, important conlldentlal position is taken as an
t ovidonco that tho Bpeafcor has no purpose to
' ' treat his lato oppononts as onemies, or to re-
' vengohlmsolt upon thorn in nny way. Mr. Mc-
, MillTn. besides being a most determined oppo-
1 nent to Mr. Crisp as a candidate, was and is a
warm supporter of, Mr. Mills. Ho voted
for the Texan. on tho, last ballot, and did
what he could, consistent with dignity
and propriety, to defeat Mr. Crisp.
Mr. MoMillin said to-night that thoro would
' -, probably boa formal mooting of tho now Cpm-
:' nlttee on Itulos to-morrow, and that by Batur-
1 l day they might bo nblo to report the rulo
authorizing tho Spoaker to appoint the com

i ble. tbo Houso will moot next week. If not. an
adjournment will bo had until after tho Christ
mas holidays, when tho committees will bo

Mr. Mills is still sick and sulky, and tbero has
I been no communication between hlm..ond the
,- i Bpeakor. Mr. Hprlnger still poses bs tho oom-
1 ing Chairman of "Ways and Moans., and
Bpeaker Crisp still dnnies, with much ejn-
'i. , phasls that there is any authority whntover for
; ' the statement that tho Illinois man has .been
L 1 atated for tho place,. The Bpeaker said this
i f morning that the matter hod not been deter-

t t fact that he was not appointed to a placo on
J.!', f , tho Committee on Rules. He said:
I ,fi i While I would havo willingly sorved on the

portot William E. Curtis, tho Dlroctor ot tho

Tho report refers to the 'rapidly Increasing

States manufacturers "who havo never at
tempted to soil merchandise In tho south

those markets to lntroduoo tholr goods. Tho

tral and South America, who havo here

sively, are now coming to the United States,
and invariably disoovor that they can And hero
nearly every artlclo they need, of a bettor qual

tained tor In Groat, Britain. Germany, and
France. The recently negotiated riciproolty
arrangements, it is said, also afford them op
portunities that are beginning to bo under

Mr. Curtis calls attention, to the Jarge In

of many merchants ongagod In tbo trade, that

The Haute orXepreeeatatlvee.
The opening of tho Houso to-day. after its
holiday of half a woek, was without speclul In
terest It vias gonerally understood that no
business would be transacted, and that the
meeting would be merely a perfunctory one,
to enable tho Spoakor to appoint tho Com
mittee on Itulos. Speculation -was rlfoasto
tho composition of that committee, and there
was quite a largo attendance of members, but
their time was principally employed in con
versation with applicants for minor places,
whom thoy politely referred to tho officors con
trolling the various departments of tho House.
Speaker Crisp, apparently no worse for tho
cold with which lio has been sulforlng for the
past few days, called tho Houso to order, and
soon afterward announced tho appointment ot
the Commlttoo on Rules as follows:
The Speaker (Chairman). Messrs. MoMillin,
CatohlngH, Heed, and Burrows.
Mr. Oates (Dom.. Ala.) offered n resolution
providing for tho appointment of a standing
committee on order of business, to conslstof
fifteen mombors. ot which tho Speaker shall
be ex-oftlclo Chairman, whloh shall have juris
diction ot the order In which business shall be
considered, having due regard to fairness and
equity among tho several committees and to
the transaction ot public business. Referred
to the Commlttoo on Rules.
Mr. Taylor (Rep., Tenn.), announced the
death ot his friend and , colleague, the Hon.
Leontdas C. HouU, who died suddenly from ac
cidental poisoning, at his home in Knoxville,
in May last
The House then, as a mark of respect to the
memory of tho deceased member, adjourned
until Saturday.
The appointment of the Committee on Rules
is regarded by members of the House as a re
turn to tho former polloyof appointing mem
bers of this committee without reference to
their other committee assignments. This was
the policy under which Sneakers Randall and
Keller acted. When Mr. Carlisle became
Bpeaker hs selected as the majority membets
of the Rules Committee the Chairmen of the
Ways and Means and Appropriations Commit
tees, the purpose being to enable them to
"guide" the course of business, so as not to
interfere with tariff or appropriation measures.
Bpeaker Rted selected his Rules Committee in
the same manner.
Mr. McMlllin of Tennessee, who is ono of the
new members ot tho Rules Committee, is
prominent as a tariff reformer, and, was one of
the most active members of tho Ways and
Means Committee. His selection is ascrioed
to his parliamentary ability, his effectiveness
as u debater, and tho fact that he Is personally
very well liked by tho member of the Demo
cratic sfdo, and will thoretnro bo ot greut as
sistance In securing tho harmonious adjust
ment ot any dlflurouceb which may arise us to
party policy.

DUCHESS BE DINO 'iTEDS AGAVf.'
The Happy Staa la Coaat Orlowshl, at Pol.
Ish Noble. ,
Pabdi. Dee. la Tho Duchess de Dtno. ne'e
Stevens, of Now York was married to-day, to
Count Orlowski. a Polish noble. The brid'o'e
witnesses wore United States Minister Bold
und Count Qallifct and tho bridegroom's wit
nesses were Count Edmond Talleyrand nnd
Count Xavlor Orlowski. Tho bridal dress was
of white peau de to'C, with bodice draped in
Moven Ave style, and having fastened to the
front a large bouquet ot orangeflon era.
The lady whose marriage is described
above was not born Stevens. She was, origin
ally, which means a good many years ago.
Miss Adela Bamnson. daughter of Joseph
Sampson, a merchant of this city. She was
first married to Mr. Frederick Livingston, also
of thlsclty. but was divorced from lilmin 1885
or thereabouts. On Jan. 20. 1887, sho married
Maurice. Marquis of Tslloyrand-PerlaTord. On
his marriage his elder brothor. the hold of the
house, ceded to him the title of Duke de Dlno.
and Miss Sampson was thereforo known to the
society of the Fauborg Bt Germain us tho
Duqhess de Dlno.
This Maurico of Talleyrand-Perlgord was n
crass widower when he married ex-Mrs.
Livingston. He had married in 1847 an
American woman. Elizabeth Curtis, daughter
of Joseph D. B. Curtis of New York. As tho
Talleyrand-Perlgord family has lived a good
deal in this country, the Duke de Dtno's fond
ness for American women Is onsily explained.
By his first wife he had ono child. By the
latter. Duchess do Dlno. there was no issue
This new alliance of the former Miss Samp
son must have been a lovo match, as she de
scends In the scalo of titles and as Polish
nobles are proverbially poor, nnd aro also not
in high esteem for nobility In these latter days
of Polish absorption. It wa Count Edmond
Talleyrand who ceded the title of Duko de
Dlno to his brother in 1887. As Count Edmond
was at thW Orlowski marriage, the probabili
ties aro that 'the Talleyrand-Perlgord family
was. In favor of, tho widowod Duchess's. new
matrimonial venture
BECOVEBIXG AX EXVLOREB'S BODY.
The Kemataa .of Bonis, who waa Killed la
the Sahara, Kratered to Hie FrleaeJe.
Pabis. Dec 18. The? body of the unfortunate
French explorer. Camillo Douls. has at last
been returned from the Sahara Desert to 'Al
geria. About three years hae elapsed since
Douls lost his life. In tho dry' desert air bis
body waa remarkably well presenod. covered
partly, as it was. by sand. It 'will, be remem
bered that Douls lost his life while attempting
to cross the, desert south of Algeria to Tim
buotoo. He was dressed as a Eabyle and
passed himself off as a Mussulman. He had
an excellont acquaintance with 'the Arabic
language, and about five years ago success
fully Imposed blmsolf upon the nomad wan
derers In tho western part of tho desert as a
Mussulman from- the Mediterranean coast
Upon the occasion of his last daring journey,
however, his duigulse was penetrated, and tho
natlvowho found his body and restored It to
friends in Algorla'gKes some additional tacts
conoernluehistraglofato. .
Tbis native says that Douls. met nt Sail a
caravan that had come from further south in
the Sahara to socuroa supply of dates. Douls
paid to the members of this carav an 100 francs
fort to privilege of accompanying tho party on
its return to tho south. It was while ho was
making tills journey that ho was assassinated
by tho men whom ho had, paid to' guide and
protect him. Thoro is still to bo soon on his
nock the marks of tho cord with which ho was
strangled.
Retribution speedily overtook hfs murder
ers, for st ion alter thoy had killed Douls they
wero assailed by tho Hoggar tribe, who killed
nearly all of them and captured tho supplies
with which the camels wore laden. Douls's
body will probably be buried in Franco.
The Slave Trade la Morocco.
Bbussels, Dec. 16. Letters received from
Morocco say thero has beon a greatly increased
traffic in slaves, the majority of whom woro re
cently captured by tho Sultan soldiers during
the raids into tho rebel districts. White men
at Fez dosoribo the painful scepos' recently
witnessed in tho slavo market there. Two
girls, almost in childhood and nearly white,
were sol for $40 and $50 apleoo. . A woman
and her 12-months-old boy wero olalmod'by
dlfforent buyers tho mother for $00 and the
Jnfantfox$33. Tho poor wothor oriod so ibit
torly when she was being separated from her
child that tho Europeans presont endeavored
to buy them both, but tho crowd in the. market
assumed a menacing attitude, ondtho Immune
foreigners wero compelled to look out for their
own safety. Thoso are the sad and revolting
phases of slavery In Morocco. Dr. Lonz. who
has travelled extenslvoly In thatoouutry.
diaws another picture. He says that the
slaves of Morocco aro treated .better than
white labor Is In Europe, andhothlnks the peo
ple, whom he calls "the whiteslaves of Eu
rope." would be much better off If they had so
manyof the comforts ot life and suoh consid
eration as tho common slaves in Morocco
