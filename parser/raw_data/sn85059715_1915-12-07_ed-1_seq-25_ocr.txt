'Great Democracies Are Not Belligerent; They Do Not Seek or Desire War'
PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE
Chief Executive Details His Plans For
National Preparedness ? Disloyalty
at Home Denounced?Urgent
Need of Our Own Ships.
Following is the measure of
President Wilson delivered nt
n Joint session of tbc senate and
bouse at the beginning of tbe
Sixty-fourth congress:
Gentlemen of I be Congress?Since I
laat had the privilege of Addressing
you on the state of the Union the war
of nation* on tbe other side of the sen,
which had then only begun to disclose
Its portentous proportions, has extend
ed Its threatening and sinister scope
until It has swept within Its flame
some portion of every quarter of tbe
globe, not excepting our own hemi
sphere, bas altered tbe whole face of
International affairs, and now presents
a prospect of reorganization and re
eonsli uctlon such as statesmen and
neoples have never been called upon
to attempt before.
Studiously Neutral.
We have stood apart, studiously neu
tral. It was our manifest duty to do
so. Not only did we have no part or
Interest in the policies which seem to
have brought tbe conflict on; It was
accessary, If a universal catastrophe
was to be avoided, that a limit should
he set to the sweep of destructive war
snd that some part of the gecat fam
ily of nations should keep the process
es of peace allvo, if only to prevent
collective economic ruin and the break
down throughout the world of the In
dustries by which its populations are
fed and sustained. It was manifestly
the duty of the self governed nations
of this hemisphere to redress, If possi
ble, the balance of economic loss and
confusion in the other. If they could
do nothing more. In the day of read
justment and recuperation we earnest
ly bopo and believe that they can be
of Infinite service.
In this neutrnlity, to which they
were bidden not only by their sep
arate life and their habitiml detach
ment from the politics of Europe, but
also by a clear perception of Interna
tional duty, the states of America have
become conscious of n new and more
vital community of Interest and moral
partnership in affnlrs. more clearly
conscious of the many common sympa
thies and Interests and duties which
bid them stand together.
There was a time In the enrly days
of our own great nation and of the re
publics fighting their way to Independ
ence In Central and South America
whin the government of the United
States looked upon Itself as in some
sort the guardian of'the republics to
the south of her as against nny en
croachments or efforts at political con
trol from the other side of the water;
felt it Its duty to play the part even
without Invitation from them, and I
think that we can claim that the task
was undertaken with a true and disin
terested enthusiasm for the, freedom
of the Americas and the unmolested
self government of her Independent
peoples. But It was always difficult to
maintain such n role without offense
to the pride of the peoples whose free
dom of action we sought to protect
and without provoking serious mls
ronceptious of our motive*, and every
thoughtful man of affairs must wel
come the nltercd circumstances of the
now day In whose light we now stand,
when there Is no claim of guardian
ship or thought of wards, but Instead
a full and honorable association as of
partners between ourselves aud our
neighbors In the Interest of all Amer
ica, north and south. Our concern for
the Independence and prosperity of the
states of Central and South America
Is not altered. We retalu unabated the
spirit that has Inspired us throughout
the whole llfo of our government and
which was so frankly put luto words
by President Monroe. We still mean
always to make a common cause of
national Independence and of political
liberty In America. But tbnt purpose
Is now better understood so far as It
concerns ourselves. It Is known not to
be a selfish purpose. It Is known to
havy In It no thought of taking advan
tage of any government In this hemi
sphere or plnylng Its political fortunes
for our own beueflt All the govern
ments of America stand, so far as we
are concerned, upon a footing of genu
ine equality and unquestioned Inde
pendence.
Put to the Test In Mexico.
We have been put to the tost in the
case of Mexico, and wo have stood tbe
test Whether we have bencfltcdMex
lco by the course wo have pursued re
mains to lie seen. Her fortunes arc In
her own hands. But we have at least
proved that we will not take advan
tage of her In her distress and under
lie to Imposo upon her an order and
government of oar own choosing. Lib
erty is often a fierce and Intractable
thing, to which no bounds can be set
nnd to which no bounds of a few
men's choosing ought ever to be set
Every American who has drank at
the true fountains of principle and tra
dition must subscribe without reserva
tion to the high doctrine of the Vir
ginia bill of rights, which In the great
days in which our government was set
up was everywhere among us accept
ed as the creed of free men. That doc
trine Is, "That government Is or ought
to he Instituted for the common bene
fit, protection and security of the peo
ple, nation or community;" that "of
all the various modes and forms of
government, that Is the best which Is
callable' of producing the greatest da
gree of happiness and safety and 1?
most effectually secured against the
danger of maladministration, and that
when any government shall t>o found
inadequate or contrary to these pur
l>o#es a majority of the community
hath nn Indubitable, Inalienable and
Indefeasible right to reform, alter or
abolish It In such manner as shall be
Judged most conducive to the public
weal." We hnvo unhesitatingly ap
plied that lierolc principle to the case
of Mexico and now hopefully await
the rebirth of the troubled republic,
which had so much of which to purge
Itself and so little sympathy from any
outside quarter In the radical but nec
essary process. We will nld and be
friend Mexico, but we will not coerce
her. and our course with regard to her
ought to be sufficient proof to all Amer
ica that we seek no political sureralnty
or selfish control.
The n- Is that the states of Amer
ica arc * hostile rivals, but co-op
eratlng tnends, nnd that tbclr grow
ing seuse of community of iuteeest.
alike In matters political and In mat
ters economic, la likely to give them a
r?ew significance as factors In Interna
tional affairs and In the political his
tory of the world. It presents them as
in a very deep nnd true sense n unit
in world nffalrs, spiritual partners,
standing together because thinking to
gether, quick with common sympathies
and common ideals. Separated they
are subject to all the cross currents of
the confused politics of a world of hos
tile rivalries; united In spirit and pur
pose they cannot he disappointed of
their peaceful destiny.
None ?f the Spirit of Empire.
This Is pan-Americanism. It has none
of the spirit of empire In It It Is the
embodiment, the effectual embodiment,
of the spirit of law and Independence
and liberty and mutual service.
A very notable body of men recently
met In the city of Washington, at the
Invitation and as the guests of this
government, whose deliberations are
likely to be looked back to as marking
a memorable turning point In the his
tory of America. They were repre
sentative spokesmen of the several
Independent states of this hemisphere
nnd were assembled to discuss the
financial and commercial relations of
the republics of the two continents
which nature and political fortune
have so Intimately linked together. I
earnestly recommend to your perusal
the reports of their proceedings nnd of
the actions of their committees. You
will get from them, I think, a fresh
conception of the ease and Intelligence
and advantaRe with which Americans
of both continents may drnw together
In practical co operation and of what
the material foundations of this hope
ful partnership of Interest mnst con
slst?of how we should build them and
of how necessary It Is that we should
hasten their building.
There Is, I venture to point out. an
especial significance Just row attach
ing to this whole matter of drawing
the Americas together In bonds of hon
orable partisanship and mutual advan
tage because of the economic readjust
ments which the world must Inevitably
witness within the next generation,
when peace shall have at last resumed
Its healthful Usks. In the perform
ance of these tasks I believe the Amer
icas to bo destined to play their parts
together. I am Interested to tlx your
attention on this prospect now because
unless you take It within your view
and permit the full significance of it to
command your thought I cannot And
the right light In which to set forth
the particular matter thnt lies at the
very front of my whole thought as I
address you today. I mean national
defense.
No one who really comprehends the
spirit of the great people for whom we
are appointed to speak can fall to per
ceive thnt their passion Is for peace,
their genius best displayed In the prac
tice of the arts of peace. Great democ
racies are not belligerent. They do not
Reek or desire war. Their thought is
of Individual liberty and of the free
labor that supports life and the un
censored thought that quickcns it
Conquest and dominion arc not in our
reckoning or agreeable to our princi
ples. But Just because we demand un
molested development and tho undis
turbed government of our own lives
tipou our own principles of right and
liberty, we resent from whatever
quarter It may come, the aggression we
ourselves will not practice. Wo Insist
upon security in prosecuting our self
chosen lines of national development.
?Wo do more than that We demand It
also for others. We do not confine our
enthusiasm for Individual liberty and
free national development to the inci
dents and movement* of affairs which
affect only ourselves. We feel It wher
ever there is a people that tries to walk
In these difficult paths of Independence
and right From the first we have
mado common cause with all partisans
of liberty on this side the sea and have
deemed It as important that our neigh
bors should be free from all ontslde
domination as that we ourselves should
be; have set America aside as a whole
for the uses of independent nations and
political freemen. ,
Oat of snch thoughts grow all our
policies. We' regard war merely as a
means of asserting the rights of a peo
ple against aggression. And we are
as fiercely jealous of coercive or dicta
tonal power within our own nation
as of aggression from without We
will not maintain a standing army ex
cept tor uses which are as necessary
In times of peace as In times of war,
mSlZZ "ha" *lw,r? 800 t0 " ,hat our
uiilltnr?- po?C6 establishment la no
nrger than is actually and continuous
ly needed for the uses of day* in which
no enemies move against us. But wo
do believe in a body of free citisens
ready and sufficient to take care of I
themselves and of the governments
which they have set np to aerve them.
In our constlintions themselves we
have commanded that "the right of'
the people to keep and bear arms shall I
not he infringed," and OUr confidence
has been that our safety in times of
danger would lie in the rising of the
nation to take care of itself, as the
! farmers rose at Lexington.
War Disciplined Might.
Knt war has never been a mere mat
?*r ?f ,T' nnd " Is n thing
of disciplined might. If our citisens
are ever to flgbt effect!velv upon a
sudden summons, they must know
how modern fighting 1s done, and what
to do when the summons comes to
render themselves Immediately avail
able and Immediately effectivo. And
the government mnst be their servant
n this matter, must supply them with
the training they need to take care of
themselves and of It The military
a? ?' iPelr government which they
w "I not allow to direct them, they niny
properly use to serve them and make
the r Independence secure, and nut
their own independence merely, but
the rights also of those with whom
tney have made common cause, should
they also bo put In Jeopnrdy. Thev
must he fitted to play the great role
in the world, and particularly In this
hemisphere, for which they are quali
fied by principle and by chastened am
bltion to play.
It Is with these ideals -in mind that
the plans of the department of war for
more adequate national defense were
conceived which will lie laid before
you, and which I urgo you to sanction
and put Into effect as soon ns they can
be properly scrutinized ami discussed,
rhey seem to me the essential first
steps, and they seem to me for the
present sufficient.
They contemplate an Increase of the
standing force of the regular army
from Its present strength of 6,023 offi
cers nnd lOL'.flM enlisted men of all
-17 ^ " "tr<>n"h ot 7,130 officers
and 334,.0, enlisted men, or 141,843
| all told, all services, rank and file bv
| the addition of flfiy-two companlei of
coast artillery, fifteen companies of en
gineers, ten regiments of infantry, four
regiments of field artillery and four
aero squadrons, besides 750 officers re
quired for a great variety of extra
service, especially the all important
whlch?T ?an"lns ,he cltlzen *orce of
which I shall presently speak, 78)2 non
commissioned officers for service in
drill, recruiting and the like and tbo
necessary quota of enlisted men for
the quartermaster corps, the hospital
corps, the ordnance department and
other similar uuxlliary services. These
arc the additions necessary to render
the army adequate for Its present du
ties, duties which it has to perform
not only upon our own continental
coasts and borders and at our Interior
army posts, but also In the Philippines,
In the Hawaiian Islands, at the lath,
mus and In Porto Klco.
By way of making t?e country ready
to assert some part of Its real power
sPho!Ztly ""I1 UP?n a lar*cr "ale
should occasion arise the plan also
contemplates supplementing the army
by a force of 400,000 disciplined cltl
?ens, raised in increments of 133,000 a
year throughout a period of three
years. This it Is proposed to do by a
process of enlistment under which the
serviceable men of the country would
.?!! . '? blnd themselres to aerve
with the colors for purposes of train
ing for short periods throughout three
years and to come to the colors at caU
at any time throughout an additional
furlough" period of three years. This
force of 400.000 men would bo pro
ylded with personul accouterments as
fast as enlisted and their equipment
for the field made ready to be supplied
at any time. They would be assem
bled for training at stated intervals at
convenient pluces In association with
suitable units of the regular army.
Their period of annual training would
not necessarily exceed two months in
the year.
" woul? de',en(1 "I>on the patriotic
feeling of the younger men of the
country whether they responded to
such a call to service or not It
would depend upon the patriotic spirit
Of the employers of the country whoth-'
er they mady it possible for the young
er men In their employ to respond un
der favorable conditions or not 1 for
one do not doubt the patriotic devotion
either of our young men or of thoie
who give them employment?those for
whose benefit and protection they
would in fact enlist I would look
forward to the nuccosa of such an ex
periment with entire confidence.
At least so much by way of prepara
tion for defense seems to me to be ab
solutely imperative now. We cannot
do less.
The program which will be laid be
fore you by tbo secretary of tbo navy
is Similarly conceived. It involve* only
a shortening of the time within which
plans long matured shall be carted
out, but it does make definite and ex
plldt a program which has heretofore
been only Implicit, held In the mlnda
of the committoes on naval affairs and
disposed in the debates of the twd
booses, but nowhere formulated or for
mally adopted. It seem, tomev?7
clear that It will be to tbe advantage
of the country for the congress to adopt
a comprehensive plan for putting the
navy upon a final footing of strength
and efficiency and to press that plan
to complotlon within the next tlvo
years. We have always looked to tlio
navy of the country as our first nnd
chief Une of defense; we have nlways
seen It to be our manifest course of
prudence to be strong on the sens.
Year by year we have been creating a
navy which now ranks very high In
deed among the navies of the maritime
nations. We should now definitely de
termine how we shall complete whnt
wo have begun and how soon.
The Navy Program.
Tho program to be laid before you
contemplates the construction within
five ycara of ten battleship*, six bat
tle cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty
destroyers, fifteen fleet submarines,
eighty-five coast submarines, four gun
boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni
tion ships, two fuel oil ships nnd one
repair ship. It Is proposod that of this
number we shall the first year provide
for the construction of two battleships,
two battle cruisers, three acout cruisers.
fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines,
I twenty-flve coast submarines, two gun
boata and one hospital ship; the second
year two battleships, one scout cruiser,
ten destroyers, four fleet submarines.
fifteen coast submarines, one gunbost
and one fuel oil ship: the third year
two battleship*, one battle cruiser, two
scout cruisers* Ave destroyers, two fleet
submarines nnd fifteen const subma
l-liics; tho fsurth year two battleships,
two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers,
ten destroyers, two fleet submarines,
fifteen coast submarines, ouo nmmunl
tlon ship and one fuel oil ship, and
tbe flfth yenr two battleships, one bat
tle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten de
stroyers. two fleet submarines, fifteen
coast snlfmarlnes. one gunboat, one am
munition ship and one repair ship.
The secretary of the nnvy Is asking
also for the Immediate addition to the
personnel of the navy of 7.500 sailors,
2,500 apprentice seamen nnd 1.600 ma
i rlnes. This increase would he suffi
cient to care for the ships which are
to be completed within the flscnl yenr
11117 and also for the number of men
which must he put In training to man
the ships which will be completed
early In 1918. It Is also necessary that
j the number of midshipmen nt the Na
val academy at Annapolis should be
Increased by at least 800 In order that
tho force of officers should be more
rapidly added to. and authority Is ask
ed to appoint, for engineering duties
only, approved graduate* of engineer
ing college*, and for *ervlce In the avi
ation corps a certain number of men
taken from civil life.
If this full program should be carried
out we should have built or building In
1021. according to the estimates of sur
vival and standards of classification
followed by tbe general board of tho
department, an effective navy consist
ing of 27 battleships of the first line, U
battle cruiser*, 25 battleships of the
second line, 10 armored cruisers. 18
scout cruisers, 6 first class <rulsers, 8
second class cruiser*, 10 third cla*s
cruisers. 108 destroyers. 18 fleet sub
marines, 157 coast submarines, 0 mon
itor*, 20 gunboats, 4 supply ship*. 15
fuel ships. 4 transports, 3 tenders to
torpedo vessels, 8 vessels of special
I types and two ammunition ships. This
would be a navy fitted to our needs
and worthy of our traditions.
But armies and instruments of war
are only part of what bo* to bo coa
Isldered If we are to consider the su
preme matter of national self sufficien
cy and security in all Its aspects.
There are other great matters which
will be thrust upon our attention
whether we will or not. There Is, for
example, a very pressing question of
trade nnd shipping luvolvcd In this
great problem of national adequacy.
It Is necessary for many weighty rea
[sons of national efficiency and dovel
I opment that we should have a great
I merchant marine. Tho gre*t mercbnnt
| fleet we once used to make us rich,
that great body of sturdy sailors who
i used to carry our flag Into every sea,
and who were the pride and often tbe
bulwark of the nation, we have almost
driven ont of existence by Inexcusable
neglect and Indifference and by a hope
lessly' blind and provincial policy of
so called economic protection. It la
high time we repaired our mistake and
resumed our commercial Independence
on the seas.
Ships of Peau N?d?d.
For It Is a question of independence.
If other nations go to. war or seek to
hamper each other"! commerce our
merchants. It seems, are at their mer
cy, to! do with as they please. We must
use their ships and use them as they
determine. We have not ship* enough
of our own. We cannot handle our
own commerce on tho seas. Our Inde
pendence Is provincial, and Is only on
land and within our own borders. We
are not likely to be permitted to use|
even the ships of other nation* In ri
valry of their own trade and are with
out means to extend onr commerce
even where tbe doors are wide open
and our goods de*lrcd. Such a slton
tlon Is not to be endurod. It 1* of capi
tal Importance not only that the Unit
ed State* should be Its own carrier on
the seas and enjoy tbe economic Inde
pendence which only on adequate
merchant marine would give It, but
also that tbe American hemisphere aa
a whole should enjoy a like Independ
ence and self sufficiency. If It Ijnot
to be drawn Into the tangle of Euro
pean affairs. Without *uch Independ
ence tie whole question of our polit
ical unity and ?elf determination la
very seriouily clouded and complicated
Indeed.
Moreover, we nan develop no true or ef-1
fectlve American policy without ship* of
our own?not ships of war. but ships of |
pence, carrying goods and currying much
more; crating friendships and rendering.
Indispensable service* to all Interests on
thla wide the water. They muat move |
constantly back and forth between tha
America*. Tlicy are the only shuttle*
that can wcuvu the delicate fabric of
sympathy, comprehension, confidence and
mutual depomlnuv in which we wiah to
clothe our i>ollcy of America for Ameri

The task of building up nn adequate
merchant marine for Amerlcn private cap
ital must ultimately undertake and
achieve, a* It ho* undertaken and achiev
ed every other like taek among ua In the
paat. with ad ml ruble enterprise. Intelli
gence and vigor, and It seems to me a
manifest dictate of wisdom that we should
promptly remove every legal obstacle that
may stand In the way of this much to be
des|r?d revival of our old independence
and should facilitate in every poaslble
way tlio building, purchase and American
registration of ships. l)ut capital cannot
accomplish this great taak of a sudden.
It must embark upon It by degreos. an
the opportunities of trade develop. Rome
thing must be done at once, done to open
routes and develop opportunltlea where
they are ns yet undeveloped, done to open
tha arteries of trade, where the currents
have not yat learned to run. especially
between tha two American continents,
where thoy are. singularly enough, yet te
be orcnted and quickened, und It Is evi
dent that only the government can un
dertake such beginnings and assume the
initial financial risks. When the risk has
paased and private capital begins to find
Its way In sufficient abundance Into theae
new channels the government may with
draw. But It cannot omit to begin, tt

take them nt once. Our goods must not

ly needed on the roada, must not be left
without meana of transport to any foreign
quarter. We must not nwalt the permis
sion of foreign shipowners and foreign
governments to send them where we will.
Government Owned Qhipa.
With a view to meotlng these pressing
necasaltlea of our commerce and availing
ouraelvaa at the eartleat poaalble moment
of the present unparalleled opportunity
of linking the two Americas together In
bonds of mutual Interest and service, an
opportunity which may never return
again If we miss It now, proposals will
be made to tha present congress for the
purchase or construction of ships to be
owned and directed by the government
similar to those made to the Isst con
gress. hut modified In somo essential par
ticulars. I recommcnd these proposals to
you for your prompt acceptance with tha
mora confidence bocause every month
that has elapsed since the former propo
sals were made has made tho necessity
for such action more and mora manifest
ly Imperative. That need was then fore
seen. It Is now acutely fait and every
where realised by those for whom trade
Is waiting, but who can And no convey
ance for their goods. I am not so much
Interested In the particulars of the pro
gram ai 1 am In taking Immediate ad
vantage of the great opportunity which
awalta ua If we will but act In this emer
gency. In this matter, as In all others, a
spirit of common counsel should prevail,
and out of It should comn an early solu
tion of thla pressing problem.
There Is another matter which seams
to me to bq vary intimatoly associated |
with the question of national safety and
preparation for defenso. That In our pol- i
icy toward tha Phillpplnea and tho peoplo
of Eorto Blco. Our treatment of them j
and their attitude toward ua are mani
festly of the first consequence In tho de
velopment of our duties In tha world and
In getting a free hand to perform thoso
duties. We must bo free from every un
necessary burdgn or embarrassment, and
there Is no better way to ba clear of em
barrassment than to fulfill our promises
and promote the Interests of those da
pendent on us to tho utmost. BlUa for
the alteration and reform of the govern
ment of the Phillpplnea and for rendering
fuller political Justice to the people of
Porto Blco were submitted to tho Blxty
thlrd congress. They will be submitted
also to you. I need not particularise tlielr
details. You are most of you already fa
miliar with them. But I da recommend
them to your early adoption with the sin
cere conviction that there are few meas
ures you could adopt which would more
servlcoably clear the way for the great
polloles by which we wish to make good,
new snd always, our right to load In en
terprises of peace and good will and eco
nomic and political freedom.
Counting the Cost,
The plans for the armed forces of the
nation which I have outlined and for the
general policy of adequate preparation for
mobilization and defense Involve, of
course, very largo additional expenditures
of money, expenditures which will consid
erably excoed the estimated revonues of
the government. It Is made my duty by
law whenever the eatlmatoa of expendi
ture exceed the estimates of revenue to
call tho attention of the congress to the
fact and suggest any means of meeting
tha deficiency that It may be wlsa or pos
sible for mo to suggest. I am ready to
believe that It would be my duty ta do
so In any ease, and X feel particularly
bound to speak of the matter when It ap
pears that the deficiency will arise di
rectly out of the adoption by the con
gress of measures which I myself urge
It to adopt. Allow me therefore to speak
briefly of the present state of the treas
ury and of the fiscal problems which the
next year will probably disclose.
On the 30th of June last there was an
available balance In the general fund of
tbo treasury of 1104,170,10*.78. Tho total es
timated receipts for the year 1918, on the
asaumptlon that the emergency revenue
measure passed by the last congress will
not be extended beyond Its present lliplt.
the 81st of December, 1916, and that the
present duty ef 1 cent per pound on sugar
will be discontinued after the 1st of May,
1916, will be $070,888,600. The balance of
June last and these estimated revenues
come therefore to a grand total of $774,
538,606.78. The total estimated fllsburae
ments for the present fiacal year, Includ
ing twanty-flvo millions for tho Tanama
canal, twelve millions for prtbable defi
ciency appropriations and 860,000'for mis
cellaneous debt redemptions, WlU be $781,
fcW.ooo, and tha balance In the general fund
of the treasury will be reduced to $20,844
606.78. The emergency revenue act If con
tinued beyond Its present time limitation
woul* produce during the half year then
remaining about forty-one millions. The
duty of 1 cent per pound on sugar If
continued would produce during the two
moil tha of the fiacal year remaining after
the lat of May about fifteen millions
These two sums, amounting together to
flfty-slx millions, if added to the revenues
of the eeoond half of the fiscal year would
yield the treaeury at thoend of the year
an available balance of 173,644,006.78.
Tho additional revenues required to car
ry qut the program of military1 and naval
preparation of which I have spoken,
would, as at preeent estimated, be for
the fiscal year 1117 $tt,?0,000. Those fig
ures, taken with the figures $or the pres
ent fiscal year wblcl* I hav? already giv
en, disclose our financial problem for the
year 1917. Assuming that the taxes Im
posed by the emergency revenue act and
the present duty on sugar are to be dis
continued and that tha balanoe at the
close of the preeent fiscal year will be '
only $20,644,008.78, that the disbursements
for ths Panama canal will again hf about
I28.ooo.ooo and that the additional expen
ditures for the* army and'navy are au
thorised by the ooti grass, the deficit to the
iSSO?
To this sum lit teast $50,000,000 should be
added to represent i% safe working bal
lino# for tho treasury and-111,000.000 to In
cluile the usual.-deficiency. estimates In
1917, and theaa additions would make a
total deficit of some $297,000,000. If the
present uxor should bo continual
throughout thin year and the next, how
ever, there would-be a balnnco In the
treasury of some fW1800,000 at the end or
the present fiscal year nnd a deficit at
the end of the next year of orilynomo
IW.000.0001 or,, reckoning In ^OnO.OOO for

ury balance at .the end Q< tf?o year, a
total deficit of some $U2,ftX\<Oiv. The ob
vious moral of the'figures Is that It la a
plain counsel, of jwfcidenbe. to continue all

Millions of Bond?.
How ahall we obtain the new revenue?
We aro frequently reminded that there
are many millions of bonds which the
treasury la authorised under existing law
to aell to reimburse the sums paid out or
current revenuaa for the construction or
the Panama canal, and It la true that
bonda for the amount of $512,412,000 are
now available for that purpose. Prior to
1911 $111,000,000 of those bonds had actually
i beon sold to recoup the expenditures at
the Isthmus, snd now conatltute a con
siderable Item of the public debt. But I
for ono do not believe thnt tho people of
i this country approve of postponing the
payment of their bills, borrowing money
la shortsighted finance. It can be Justi
fied only when permanent things are to
be accomplished which many generations
will certainly benefit by and which It
aeems hardly fair thnt a single genera
tion should pny for. The-objeota wc nre
1 now proposing to spend money for cannot
be so classified, except In tho sonae that
everything wisely done may be said to bo
done In the Interest of posterity ns wall
ns In our own. It seems to me a clear
dlctato of prudent statesmanship and
fronk finance thnt in what we are now,
I hope, about to undertake we aheuld pay
ns wo go. Tho people of the country are
entitled to know Just what burdens of
taxation they are to carry and to know
from the outset now. Tho new bills
ahould be paid by Internal toxntlon.
To what aources, then, shall we turn"
1 This la ao peculiarly a question which the
i gentlemen of the house of reprcaentatlvea
are expected under the constitution to
propoae an answer to that you will nard
i ly expect me to do more thnn discuss it
I In very general terms. Wo fhould be fol
lowing an almost universal example or
modern governments If we were fo draw
the greater part or even the who ^-?r the
revenues we need from the Incont. taxea.
Ey somewhat lowering the present limits
of exemption and the figure at which the
surtax shall begin to be Imposed and by
lncreoalng step by step throughout the
present graduation the *urtnx Itself, the
Income taxes ns st present npportloned
would yield sums sufficient to bslance the
books of the treasury at the end of the
fiscal year 1117 without anywhere mating
tho burden unreasonably or oppressively
heavy. The precise reckonings aro fully
and accurately set out In tho report or
tho nocretnry of tho treasury which will
I bo Immediately laid before you.
i Tax on Gasoline.
And there are many additional sources
of revenue which can Justly be resorted
to without hampering tho Industries of
the country or putting any too ureal
churgo upon Individual expenditure. A l
per cent tax per gallon on gasoline and
nnphtha would yield, at the present esti
mated production, $10,000,00^ .a tax of 80
cents per horsepower on automobiles and
internal explosion engines $1*.000.000. a
stamp tax on bank checks probably $18,
' 000.000. a tax of S cents per ton on pig
Iron Il0.000.000. a tax of 60 cents per tonon
fabricated Iron and steel probably $10,000.
000. In a country of great Industries like
tills It ought to be easy to distribute the
burdene of taxation without making them
anywhere bear too heavily or too exclu
slvely upon any one sat of persons or un
dertakings. What la clear la that the In
dustry of this generation should pay the
bills of this generation.
I have spoken to you today, gentlemen,
upon a single theme, the thorough prepa
ration of. the nation to care for Its own
socurlty and to make sure of entire free
dom to play the Impartial role In this
hemisphere and In the world which we ail
believe to have been providentially assign
ed to 1L I have had In iny mind no
thought of any ImmodJato or particular
danger arising out of our relations with
other nations. Wo are at peace with all
the nations of tho world, and there Is rea
son to hope that no question in controver
sy between this and other governments
will lead to any serious breach of amica
ble rolatlons, grave as some differences of
attitude and policy have been and may
yet turn out to be. I am sorry to say that
the gravest threats against our national
peace and safety havo been uttered with
in our own borders. Thera are citizens of
the United States, I blush to admit, born
under other fisgs. but welcotned under our
gonerous naturalisation laws to the full
freedom and opportunity of America, who
have poured the poison of disloyalty Into
the very arteries of our national life, who
have sought to bring the authority and
good name of our government Into con
tempt, to destroy our Industries wherever
they thought It- effective for their vindic
tive purposes to strike at them and to de
base our politics to the uses of foreign In
trigue. Their number Is not great aa com
pared with the whole number of those
sturdy hosts by whloh our nation has been
enrlohed In recent generations out of virile
foreign stocks, but' it is great enough to
have brought deep disgrace upon us and
to have mads it necessary that we ahould
promptly make use of processes of law by
which we may be purged of their corrupt
distempers.
Disloyalty Denounced,
America never wltne. i anything like
this before. It never dreamed It possible
that men swora Into It* own citizenship,
men drawn out of great free stocks such

est elements of'that little, ;but how he

natural resources of our great home Ifknd ?
and of the lands outside our continental
borders which look to us for protection,
for encouragement and for assistance In
their development; from the organisation
nnd frnedom and vitality of our economic .
life. The domcatlc questions which en
gaged the attention of the last congress ]
are more vital to the nation in this Its
time of test than-at any other time. We
cannot adequstely make ready for any
trial of our strength. unless we wisely
and promptly direct the force of our laws
Into these all Important fields of domestic
action. A matter which It seems to me *.
we should have very much at henjVtg,
