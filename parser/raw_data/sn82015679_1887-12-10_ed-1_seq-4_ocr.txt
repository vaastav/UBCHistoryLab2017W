Most is out of jail again. New York jail
doors seem to be oiled.
Protection to American industries is very
important but protection to free and fair elec
tions is not less so.
Mr. Cleveland began to read up on the
tariff question a little late in life. He evi
dently thinks he ha3 discovered some great
fundamental principles.
- A LITTLE learning is a dangerous thing,
end half -educated men are apt to be much
more arrogant than really -wise ones. Mr.
Cleveland adds cultivated bumptiousness to
natural egotism.
Ths efforts of Democratic editors who
discern the signs of the times to prove that
the President's message is not a free-trade
document are of a sort to bring tears to the
eyes of a tobacco sign. . '
A Democratic exchange says the Presi
dent's message will clear the air of a vast
amount of malaria. May be so; but the im
precations of the Democracy in the South and
"West seem to indicate that malaria is rising
Ugain thicker than ever.
The evidence discovered of gross corruption
in one of the Chicago school districts ought to
te followed by the indictment and conviction
of the guilty parties. Of all public trusts
none should be more jealously guarded than
the public-school management.
POSSIBLY the Rev. Mr. Berry, of Wolver
hampton, will reach a decision in regard to
the call to Brooklyn when he learns the full
particulars of Plymouth's treatment of Rev.
Parker. He may conclude that it is not well
to identify himself with a churchof that size.
The able representatives from quite a num
ber of cities are engaged in explaining how
they failed to secure the Republican national
convention. These things re always suscep
tible of explanation, but in this case the real
reason was because they did not come from
Chicago.
It is doubtless true, as Mr. Powderly says,
that the government can do the telegraphing
of the country as well as it can carry the
mails, but, as matters now are, the illustra
tion is not a very happy one. The govern
ment has not conducted the postal department
in a satisfactory way for two years.
As a spectacle of wifely devotion the
presence of Mrs. Harper at her husband's
side during the progress of the Fidelity Bank
trial may please the sentimentalists, but in the
light of the revelations made by witnesses,
the appearance of the injured woman in the
character of a Nemesis armed with a gun
would better 6uit the average sense of
iitness.
Faithful administration papers aire now
. caving that all Congress has to do in order to
have peace and prosperity is to frame and
V pass a tariff bill in accordance with the Presi
.'dent's message. Just so; it is a beautiful
idea, and the only thing in the way of work
ing it out is that Congress is not of the same
mind with the President. But we shall
have peace and prosperity notwithstanding.
Indianapolis could have handled the Re-
vi: . a: - i u t..i.i. j.i
i puuucau uaiiuiiai cuuveuuuu uuuer uiau
jtome of the cities that asked for it, but she
( did not compete. Her innate sense of modes-
ty will always prevent her from "biting off
i more than she can chew." With natural gas
' and the improvements f the next few years,
including new hotels, etc., she will be in good
r shape for the convention of 1S92. All things
', come to those who wait.
Perhaps the Democracy of Indiana would
like to have the next campaign in thi3 State
made solely on the tariff question, to the ig
noring of their record in State affairs. This
will not be done. The scandalous misman
egement of the State institutions, the disfran
chising gerrymander, the penitentiary frauds,
the insane asylum infamy, the Green Smith
usurpation and the revolutionary course of
the Democratic majority in the Senate will all
eome in for a full share of attention. It will
be an all-around fight.
The Democratic party to-day is destroying
republican government in the South, degrad
ing popular suffrage and by violence and
' fraud are establishing and maintaining an oli
garchy in several States of the Union. In this
condition of affairs the President tries to make
the people believe that their liberties are en
iangered by the surplus in : the treasury and
that the salvation of the country depends on
the adoption of free trade. - The Republican
party will stay right -with him on that issue
Wt it will not loose sight of the other.
When the Democrats came into power they
Hade a great show of economy by reducing
.he force in various offices under the pretense
ihat there were more persons employed and
higher salaries paid than there ought to be.
Now, nearly all of them are asking for in
sreased clerical force and increased salaries,
the law requires the Secretary of the Treas
ury to submit to Congress, every two years, a
Wok of estimates of government expend
itures for the next two years. This is based
on the requests and recommendations of the
heads of departments. The estimates sub
mitted to this Congress show that nearly
every department official is asking for an
increase of force and salaries. The Postmaster-general
says, "the salaries of many
e
officers of the department are grossly
inadequate and unfair." He asks for several
new officials and an increase of salaries
amounting to $3,800 a year. The Secretary
of the Treasury, the different auditors, the
Comptroller of the Currency, the Chief of the
Bureau of Statistics, the Commissioner of
Agriculture, and nearly all the other heads of
bureaus ask for an increase. In every case
the salaries are the same as those paid to
Republican officials which, for campaign
effect, were charged to be excessive. Where
additional clerks are asked for it isto replace
those discharged by the present administra
tion under the pretense of "economy." That
cry will not serve next year. Gone to take
its place with "Turn the rascals out," and
that other solemn appeal of the late Thomas
A. Hendricks, to "Open the books."
NATURAL GAS-
Possibly the Journal will be permitted to
print the letter from Judge Martindale upon
the question of the prompt introduction of
natural gas into the city without raising a
choru3 of indignant protests from those who
deem it treason to offer the most respectful
suggestion upon this important matter.
The letter i3 not open to the objection of
being anonymous; the Judge signs his
name to what he has to say, and by most
men his facets, figures and suggestions will, at
least, be given consideration. The Journal
calls attention to it because it believes the
subject an important one, and worth the
attention of reasonable people; any other class
need not be taken into account. The record
of the Journal is straight and consistent on
this matter. From the first we have been
advocating what we honestly believed and
hoped would bring gas to the city at ,the
earliest possible moment and on the best pos
sible terms. We have forever been opposed
to a monopoly, no matter under what name
or under what management; be it a monopoly
as to supply, to prices, or to time. The
Journal has said that the present ordinance
was passed for the purpose of keeping natural
gas out of the city. There is no sort of
doubt of this. The paternity of the ordinance
.and the circumstances under which it was
passed are conclusive as to that. We have
said that we did not believe that gas would
come into Indianapolis under its conditions,
and that opinion is not changed by the fact
of the acceptance of the ordinance by the
Broad Ripple, the Capital City and the Gas
Trust companies. It is not necessary to cast
reflection upon the good faith of any or all of
the companies in filing their acceptances.
We do not impugn the motives of anybody;
but a conversation with the officers of the
Trust, and the statements of Judge Martin
dale, who says he has also talked with them,
only confirm the opinion. The best that the
Trust officers would say or have said, is that
they could not tell whether any changes
would be needed until after they had begun
the furnishing of gas. We believe it to be
perfectly clear that certain amendments will
be absolutely necessary even for the Trust,
which can take an ordinance under manifestly
better auspices than any other company. We
do not believe that the officers, trustees and
directors of the Trust will unite in a card to
the public they represent, and say that they
will not ask any changes whatever in the
ordinance, and will bind themselves under a
recoverable bond to furnish gas in sufficient
quantities to supply the city under its present
provisions. If any changes are needed, why
should not the changes be made now, and let
the ordinance be accepted by other companies
and the work of laying the pipes in the streets,
piping the houses, and supplying the gas to
manufacturers and housekeepers who may
want to take it, be begun at once, instead of
waiting until next September, or such earlier
date as the Trust may be ready? Why keep
working men out of employment this winter,
and people out of the economy and advantage
of gas, if nothing substantial is to be gained
by the delay?
There is another side to the matter pre
sented by the letter of Judge Martindale that
makes this policy the more necessary and
appropriate, and that is that there is plenty of
field and plenty of work for all the companies
and all the money liable to come here. It is sim
ple folly to talk of the Trust, with even a million
of dollars capital, furnishing all the gas Indian
apolis will want. The figures conclusively
prove that with the gas here to be used, there
will be patronage sufficient, not only for the
Trust, but for all other companies and all
other money, public or private, that can be
attracted into the business. It is not a
question of rates any longer; the Trust is
entitled to the thanks of the people for
having settled that question in the interest of
cheap gas. The Trust has done a good work,
and it should not by any short-sightedness
interfere with the immediate prosperity of
the city, to which it has thus far contributed
so conspicuously and so well. The only
question is, does the ordinance need amend
ment; will it need amendment for the Trust
to work under it satisfactorily? If it does,
these changes should be made now, and let
the work of supplying the gas to the city be com
menced at once by the companies ready to do
so. The ordinance should not be amended to suit
any particular company; let it be made to
suit the Trust, for instance, and then, if it is
not satisfactory to other companies, let them
stay out. But if, when next September
comes, it is found that the Trust must have
such changes as if made now would have
admitted gas to the city several months
earlier, beside furnishing welcome employ
ment to men who would otherwise be idle,
then the position of the men responsible for
that state of affairs will not be a pleasant one,
and all the cheap talk of taking care of the
poor man, and of a consuming desire for the
interest of the plain people, will not weigh a
feather as against the palpable fact that the
prosperity of the city has been postponed and
a great many people been compelled to pay
hundreds and thousands of dollars that might
have been saved, to eay nothing of depriving
hundreds of men of work in months when work
is a boon to the unemployed. This side of the
question is worth serious consideration by
the managers of the Trust and by ' the people
generally, and it should be considered without
prejudice. Certainly the Journal has no
thought adverse to the best interests of the
city; it has no other interest than what is
common to every well-wisher of Indianapolis.
A1T0THEB QUESTION TO BE BEMEMBESED
The President and his free-trade confreres
would be glad to make the tariff question the
sole issue in the next campaign and to force
the fight on that issue alone. To accomplish
this Mr. Cleveland has done what no Presi
dent ever did before, viz., presented an
exaggerated and sensational statement of the
government finances, and represented to the
country and the world that we are in imminent
danger of a financial panic. He says the sit
uation, meaning the Treasury surplus,
"presages financial convulsion and wide
spread disaster;" that it is "fraught with dan
ger which , should be fully realized," and
actually hints at "a time when an abused and
irritated people" may take things into their
own hands. Such language as this from a
President of the United States could only be
justified by a public danger at once real and
imminent. That the present situation does
not involve such danger nor any approach to
it, is evidenced by the fact that ; even the
President's sensational message has failed to
disturb business in the least or to excite any
apprehension among ' business men. The
bankers, capitalists, merchants, manufactur
ers and business men of the country, intelli
gent, far-sighted and proverbially conserva
tive, are not at all alarmed by the President's
pessimistic views and gloomy predictions in
regard to the business situation. They know
better. This dark picture of impending dis
aster is a part of the President's senational
scheme for forcing the tariff issue to the front
and making it the overshadowing if not the
only issue in the next campaign. Well, it is
an important issue, and the Republican party
will gladly meet the Democracy on the ques
tion of protection versus free trade. But it
must be remembered that it is not the only
important question in American politics,1? as
the President would imply by the remarkable
conspicuousness he gives it and by ignoring
all other questions. We do not underrateits
importance, but there is another question! of
even greater importance. We mean the
question whether true Republican government
shall be established in the Southern Stateshand
whether the basis of congressional represen
tation in the South shall be the same al in
the North. This is more important thanfthe
tariff question by as much as moral sentiment
is more important than money, and ss eternal
truth and justice are higher than dollars and
cents. It is a fundamental question, for no
settlement of the tariff question, nor any
other legislation of Congress, can be just, or
ought to be binding, when the representa
tives from one section of the country are
elected on an entirely different basis of repre
sentation from those in another section.
This is the paramount question before the
American people to-day the question of
establishing and maintaining Republican
government in all the States of the Union,
of enforcing equal rights, aud of placing the
voting constituencies of the North and the
South on an equal footing in respect of
political power and representation. At pres
ent there are several Southern States where
Republican government does not exist, and
in some of which 1,000 white voters have
the same representation in Congress that
10,000 voters in Indiana have. Take Georgia,
for instance. That State has ten Representa
tives in Congress. At the last election the
total number of votes cast for these ten Con
gressmen was 27,47o. The Seventh district
of Indiana alone cast 44,046. Thus one con
gressional district in Indiana cast 17,000 more
votes than ten districts in Georgia, and Mr.
By n urn's vote, 22,852, was only 4,000 leas
than the total vote cast for the entire ten
members from Georgia. Take the Sixths
Indiana district, General Browne's. In the
last election the district cast 33,753 votes,
which General Browne received 20,397. Thus
it took 20,397 Republican votes in his district
to elect one Republican Congressman, while
25,525 Democratic votes in Georgia elect ten
Congressmen. This is a scandalous state of
things and cannot continue. Talk about the
danger of a surplus in the treasury with such
facts as these confronting us! Talk about any
question extinguishing all others when re
publican government is overthrown, liberty
assassinated and the elective franchise turned
into a farce! How long will the freemen of
the North submit to being lashed to the
wheels of the Southern Democratic chariot?
How long will the people of Indiana tolerate
the infamous system that gives to every
white man's vote in Georgia more than ten
times the weight of one in Indiana? This is
the paramount question before the American
people to-day, and must continue to be until
it is settled on a basis of justice and equality.
This is the question that Mr. Cleveland ig
nores and endeavors to push out of sight and
out of mind. He may well seek to put it
down. It is the damned spot in American
politics that will not out. The Republican
party will meet the Democracy on the tariff
question, but it will not be diverted from
making the question of an equal ballot also a
main question.
Again has the law been twisted out of
shape and substantial justice been thwarted
in the interest of that worst of all criminal
classes, the defiant and arrogant whisky-lawbreakers,
who have been so long the pet of
political parties and of courts. In a case
appealed from this county, the Supreme
Court decides that where a liquor-dealer can
show that he sold more than one drink on the
same day, the State can be compelled to elect
on which sale they will attempt a conviction.
In this particular case a man was charged
with selling on the Fourth of July. The evi
dence showed that he had sold both in the
morning and the afternoon. The defendant
asked that the State elect which sale it would
proceed on. The indictment only charged
one offense, "contained only one count, and
any evidence showing a sale on the day speci
fied would seem to be competent. The pros
ecutor claimed there were no parts of days in
law, and that a conviction on either sale
would be a bar to further prosecution
for any sale on that day. Judge Irvin
so ruled, and a conviction was had. The case
is now reversed by the Supreme Court. Pos
sibly, the argument will be made that the re
versal gives the State the right to prosecute
for each and every sale on any interdicted day;
but the effect of the decision is to confuse
evidence, and to put it in the power of the
white-aproned criminals to defeat J prosecution.
The more sales they can make the harder will
a conviction be. The liquor men understand
the force of the decision, and there i3 great
glee over it in the saloons of the law-breakers.
Once more we take occasion to remark that
the liquor men and their allies are simply
treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath.
The people of this country, and of this State,
are determined that the liquor business shall
be restrained bylaw, and if they keep on with
their defiance and are backed up by courts,
the people will wipe out both saloons and
courts as with a besom. The warning is
given without charge, and can be heeded by
liquor men and judges as they please; but it
is the God's truth about the whole business.
Mugwump malignity toward the Republic
an candidate for President in 18S4 crops out
anew every now and then. The Boston Her
ald quotes a Republican exchange as saying
that Mr. Cleveland will probably not suffer
from calumny in another campaign, as his
private life at the White House has given rise
to no scandal, and adds significantly: "It
would, indeed, be a relief to have a campaign
clear of scandal on both sides; but, of course,
to make this probable, it is essential that the
Republicans nominate a candidate for the
Presidency whose record does not invite
attack. They have many such meu, and un
til late years no one either suggested or con
ceived that they would fail to take their
President from among them." If this is not a
threat to rake up the old, and exploded, and
outrageous slanders against Mr. Blaine and
his family, then what does it mean? The
Herald disgraces itself in the eyes of decent
people by such utterances.
Bf. If we understand the decision of the Su
preme Court it is nonsense to talk of prohibi
tion as a national issue, in the sense that any
national law could be passed to prohibit the
manufacture and sale of liquors in the States.
The foundation of the decision is, that the
power to prohibit resides in the police power
of the States a reserved power, and it is not
for the federal authority to say how or to what
Extent that power shall be exercised. If a
State" chooses to prohibit that is the State's
business, and the United States will not inter
fere. ' It is equally true that the United States
could- not force prohibition upon a State.
Those who talk of prohibition as a national is
sue, meaning to convey the impression that a
national prohibitory law could be passed that
would be binding upon the States, deceive
themselves and are attempting to deceive oth
erc. The United States cannot exercise the
police power of the States for the States.
"It is a noteworthy fact," remarked a
prominent lawyer last night, upon hearing of
the action of the Supreme Court in this case,
"that while , Irvin has been judge of the
Criminal Court for less than a year, he has
had seven or eight cases reversed by the Su
preme Court, or nearly all the cases that have
been appealed from his court." The Sen
tinel, It is still a more noteworthy fact that the
prominent lawyer lied. J udge Irvin has been
uon the bench a year, and he has had but
one ease reversed, the, one of the liquor-sell-ers,
and if the Supreme Court can stand such
a reversal. Judge Irvin can. Mr. Albert Ayres,
w bo sat for a few days in a seat stolen for
hTp.- by Democratic thieves and forgers, had as
many cases reversed during his brief term as
Judge Irvin has had in a year.
The meeting of the Republican clubs in
Tew York on the 15th inst. will be important
xd interesting, and the attendance of dele
gates and others from Indiana should be large
nd representative. Where clubs have been
xormed representatives should be sent, and
where there are none, volunteer delegates will
be received and welcomed. The movement
to organize the country into clubs is an im
portant one for the next campaign. As we
have already stated, the railroads will make
concessions in rates, and the Journal can
arrange for round-trip for one and one-third
fare for any desiring to go, and who wilj
send us their names at once.
Editor Labouchere, of London Truth,
says he is a free-trader geographically and
that if he had been an American he would be
a protectionist. President Cleveland is also
a free-trader geographically. He wants Eng
land to profit by a removal of the American
tariff. If Mr. Cleveland were a true and in
telligent American, he too, would be a protec
tionist. There are, it will be observed, cer
tain points of resemblance between "Labby"
and G rover C.

Yes, sir, by a recent law all railroads are now

American Traveler Yes, I just heard about
this change and came to you to make sure.
You were appointed by the President, wero you?
"Yes, I swung my delegation over to his side
in the nominating convention."
'-What speed do your trains make now?"
'Thirty miles an hour if nothing happens."
"Is old Surepop still in charge of the through

'No. he was no good. He just gave all his
time to that dirty locomotive of his instead of
going around with the boys and drumming up

"Humph! You still have the old switchmen
though, I suppose?"
Got rid of them all; nothing but dead-wood.
Why sir, there wasn't one of 'em could carry a

New Yorker Knjoy a New Sensation.
The Critic.
A genuine delight was the racy recitation, by
James Whitcomb Riley, of his Hoosier dialect
poeui 'When the frost is on the punkin, and the
fodder s in the shock.' It was received with
enthusiastic applause, as was also his surpass
ingly funny impersonation of a certain type of
'Educator'. Words cannot reproduce the effect
of his pedagogic eloquence, his polysyllabic
condescension, hisWoyancy, his blandness. It
was most admirable fooling.

THE NEED OF CO-OPERATION
The Evangelical Alliance Continues Its
Discussion of Social Problems.
Bishop Harris Urges Unity, and Declares that
the Existing Division Is a Scandal
Views of Dr. Washington Gladden.
Washington', Dec. 9. At the opening of the
conference of the Evangelical Alliance, this
morning, President Dodge announced that ill
ness bad prevented Rev. Dr. Storrs, of Brook
lyn, from being present, and that his paper on
"The Necessity of Co-operation in Christian
Work" would be read by Rev Dr. Chamberlain,
of Brooklyn, whom he introduced. Dr. Storrs,
in his paper, allades to the perils arising from
the misuse of wealth, illiteracy, and the es
trangement of many from the church. He did
not think there was any reason for thinking
that Christianity had not divine and divinely
directed resources adequate for the emergency.
The trreat thing needed is to gather up and con
centrate our power.
Bishop Samuel Harris, of Michigan, said he
believed that this conference is the practical re
sponse of Christian wisdom to the call of a gen
erally recognized need. Vast and hostile forces
are being marshaled and firmly knit to attack
all that we hold most dear. It would be mad
ness, said the speaker, to remain divided in this
Hoar of danger. We must substitute co-operation
for competition, as economists teach the
producer to do. Christ was the great statesman
who gave ns the only policy on which civilization
can be at once free and safe. His leadership
has always succeeded. Our fathers builded
wiser than they knewin founding upon the Rock
of Ages. We must be equally opposed to im
perialism and socialism. This is a fit task for
Anglo-Saxons, and this is to be an Anglo-Saxon
civilization, notwithstanding our- enormous
accretions from other races. Duty, not glory,
is the watchword of our patriotism. The Bible,
the Sabbath and liberty of conscience must be
defended, with Christ as our leader indeed,
but with our own active co-operation
aa well, or we shall go the way
of other nations whose early history has been
fair and promising. We would ba cowards and
traitors if we did not recognize and fight the
old but now freshly-awakened forces of public
and social disorder. The kind of co-operation
we advocate is not political. Church and state
must be separate. Christ said, "My kingdom is
not of this world," but His church can be the
channel through which He can work to supply
health and vigor to a nation. Our common
school system is the peculiar product of our
Anglo-Saxon Christianity, and we must stand
for it against the very strong and dangerous at
tack of ultraniontanism, which has taken ad
vantage of our divisions to banish the Bible
from it, and then, with savage inconsistency,
attacks it as godless. We have often handed it
over to the tender mercies of supervisors who
are but the tools of ultraniontanism. But we
must go deeper. We must seek not only to
keep this or that external institution we
must strike at the root of sin in the
heart. It is ' the one enemy of lib
erty and of everything good. Co-operation in
promoting vital, intense personal piety is the
one great need. We must take higher ground
than we did fourteen years ago at the New York
meeting of this alliance, when the divisions of
Protestant Christendom were apologized for.
Thank God! we are growing wiser. We are
seeing that our divisions are a weakness and
scandal. Hence I hailed the call for this meet
ing to consult how we can substitute co-operation
for the competition which has so wasted our
resources, especially in home missionary fields
in the West, where, in small towns, several
churches, by their competition, afford a spec
tacle to make devils laugh and angels weep; and
in cities the need of union is equally great. But
further co-operation is needful, if the chureh is
to be a shield, the mediator between rich and
poor, and prevent the despotism and the waste
of socialism. It is the foe not alone of wealth,
but also of liberty, of hope, and of everything
just. By reason of our divisions Protestant
Christianity has lost touch with the "disinher
ited" classes. Our divisions Lave impoverished
our love for man, as ultraniontanism often fails
to minister to the wants it creates and fosters,
and leaves to us Protectants to feed and clothe.
She makes a magnificent and imposing show of
caring for the poor, but it is hollow and unreal.
We have been miserably and selfishly divided,
and hence our weakness. Our magnificent
heritage is ic danger. The cry of the poor in
the cities is going up to a Falher in heaven
whom we have not effectively led them to know,
because we have not worked together as one
body of which Christ is the head. Great ap
plause. At the conclusion of the address President
Dodee said that in coming to the church he bad
overheard an old lady tell another, that the
people nocking here were going to an "angel
ical" alliance. "Shall we not make it so in
truth?" he asked.
Rev. Dr. Washington Gladden, of Columbus,
C, was introduced, and continued the subject.
He Baid there must be diversity of operation in
grace, as in nature. But diversity is one thing,
and divisions Are quite another. They display,
not the manifold wisdom of God, but the per
versity of man. Organic formal consolidation
is not practical. Liturgical uniformity has done
about all it can at present. "I don't hope much
from sentimental unity. Union meetings in
which we can tell one another before the public
how much we love each other are all right, if it
is true," sail the speaker, "but, if not, it is cant.
Profession should halt till practice catches up.
But co-operation is possible among those who
differ about many things merely external. We
have made progress in this matter. Members
and ministers pass and repass freely from
church to church. We unite in evangelistic
labor, which is good if we don't break up the al
legiance of individuals to a particular church.
We can't warm a city by big bonfires in the pub
lic squares. A man converted in a church will,
on the average, do as much as three
converted in a rink. A thing much less demon
strative is better. The best parts of towns and
cities have twice as many churches as are
needed; in the poorer, far too few. So of the
competition between, many sects in new towns.
We must frankly admit the essential equality of
all Christian churches. There is no sect which
readily admits this equality. We must drop
this competition of the Kilkenny fair sort. We
must recognize the peril to our industries, to
the government. If the present widespread dis
content develops into anarchism, we must throt
tle that by law, but we must use prevention to
keep it from coming to that. The unreasonable
demands of the workingman must, as far as
possible, be modified by reason and love, and
this only the church can do successfully. The
churches must repent of their abandonment of
the poor districts, and then go and do works
meet for repentance. They should colonize
with tome of their best families, and not merely
build missions. It is work that can't be done by
hired men, missionaries or theological students.
Your money is needed, but you are needed still
more."
Rev. George E.' Post, M. D., of the medieal
mission, Beirut, Syria, said: "The past taught
us what to believe about God; the future mast
show what we are to do for men. The past has
been marked by strife; the future must see co
operation." He closed with a fervent plea for
unity in America, for the sake of missions
abroad.
The venerable rhiliD Schaff. D. D., was next
introduced as one who was the father of the al
liance and one of the most active workers for Us
ends. He thought this conference, held in this
cosmopolitan city, was cf eual or greater im
portance than that held fourteen years ago in a
provincial town on the banks of the Hudson, New
York. We can't think bad enough of the devil or
good enough of God. Christ is in His ehureb all
days, even to the end of the world. If this
securities suffices, we can go forward. A good
stomach is needed for the physical, a clear brain
for the intellectual, and a. warm heart for the
spiritual man. America has these. Its stomach
can digest English beef. Scotch porridge, Swiss
cheese and German saur-kraut, and then drink a
cup of French coffee and smoke a Spanish cigar.
The President interrupted the speaker to.
announce that the hour of adjournment had
arrived, and requested the Doctor to write out
the remarks he meant to make for the printed
volume which the Alliance will issue. The
session closed in order that the delegates might
attend the President's reception.
At the afternoon session Josiah Strong, D. D.,
addressed the congregation. He was followed
by Frank Russell, D. D., who read a paper on
co-operation in small cities. The next address
was by Rev. A. F. ScDaufner, 1. JD., of New
York. Remarks were also made by Thos. IL
MeMulien. of Arizona.
"Individual Responsibility, Growing out of
Perils and Opportunities." was the subject of
the evening discussion. The Rev. Dr. Gordon,
of Boston, the first speaker, said that responsi
bility is measured by opportunity and ability.
There are three perils which must be faced.
The first is the impatient murmuring of com
munism. Religion suffers in this respect. It is
not, he said, the orthodox creed, but orthodox
greed wbica repels the masses of the people.
Agnosticism is another source of peril. Agnos
ticism is culture ending in ignorance, as the higV
est mountain peaks are lost in the clouds. Rea
son and faith are like the two compartments of
an hour-glass. When one is full, the other is
empty. He wished no more chairs established
in theological schools to teach the relation of
science to Christianity till science becomes fixed.
The third peril, he said, arises from the hold
which strong drink has on the lower and vicious
classes.
The Rev. Dr. Van Dyke, of New York, said
that danger is not to be apprehended from out
side influences, but from supine inertness within
the church. The peril of our country is from
citizens who do not care enough about it t
vote.
' Short speeches were also made by the Rev.
Thane Miller, of Cincinnati, and others.
Adjourned sine die.
The Delegates at the White Doaie.
Washington, Dec 9. The White House thbr
afterndon was invaded by nearly 2.000 members
of the Evangelical Alliance, who called in a
body, about 1 o'clock, to pay their respects ta
President and Mrs. Cleveland. They were re
ceived in the East Room and were individually
presented to the President and Mrs. Cleveland
by Mr. Wm. E. Dodge, president of the Alliance,
and CoL John M. Wilson. Mr. Dodge made a
brief address expressing the great pleasure It
gave the Alliance as a body to show-'their so
preciation of the President and his wife who he
said, was especially loved and respected by them
all. He closed by urging the President to co
oporate with the Alliance in the cause of Chris
tianity. The President replied as follows: ;-; i
Mr. President I am glad to meet so large a delega
tion from the Evangelical Alliance of the United
States. I understand the purpose of this alliance to
be the application of Christian rules of conduct to the
problems and exigencies ot social and political life.
Such a movement cannot fail to produce the most
valuable results. All must admit that the reception
of the teachings of Christianity results in the purest
patriotism, in the most scrupulous fidelity to public
trust, and in the best type of citizenship. Those who
manage the affairs of government are by this means
reminded that the law of God demands that they
should be courageously true to the interests of the
people, and that the Ruler of the Universe will re
quire of them a strict account of their stewardship.
The people, too. are thus taught that their happiness
and welfare will bo best promoted by a conscientious
regard for the interests of a common oi thai hood,
and that the success of a government by the people
depends upon the morality, the justice and
the honesty of the people. I am es
pecially pleased to know that your efforts
are not cramped and limited by denominational lines,
and that your credentials are found in a broad Chris
tian fellowship. Manifestly, if you seek to teach
your countrymen toleration, you yourselves must be
tolerant; if you would teach them liberality for the
opinions of each other, you yourselves must be lib
eral, and if you would teach theia unselfish patriot
ism, you yourselves must be unselfish and patri
otic. "There is enough of woik in the field you have
entered to enlist the hearty cc -operation of all who
believe in the value and efficacy ct Christian teaching
and practice. Your noble mission, if undertaken in a
broad and generous spirit, will surely arrest the atten
tion and respectful consideration of your fellow-citi-sens;
and your endeavors, consecrated by benevolence
and patriotic love, must exert a powerful influence ia
the enlightenment and improvement of onr people in
illustrating the strength and stability of our institu
tions and in advancing the prosperity and greatness
of our beloved land.
Rev. Dr. Burchard. of New York, of the
"Three It's" fame, was among those presented.
The President recognized him at once, and, ad
vancing towards him, said with considerable
earnestness and fervor that he was very glad to
see him. whereupon the crowd of delegates
broke oat into laughter.

Harrison and Hawley. .
Stannton iVa.) Valley Virginian.
A stalwart and earnest Virginia Republican,
writing from West Virginia, suggests in a
private letter a presidential ticket for 1888.
While it is not the policy of the Virginian to
become the pronounced advocate of the claims
of any one particular Republican for the recog
nition of the national convention, the names
presented oy our correspondent deserve respect
ful consideration. They are Gen. Benj. Harri
son, of Indiana, and Gen. Jos. R. Hawley, of
Connecticut. They are both statesmen of the
broadeBt cast experienced in legislation, con
servative in their views, and prominent in the
counsels of their party. They have both served
in the lower and upper bouses of Congress.
They were both distinguished soldiers of the
Union army, and each possesses the confidence of
the Republicans of the country. And not the
least of the recommendations they would have
to the Southern people is that General Harrison
is directly descended from Virginia stock and a
grandson of President Harrison, and General
Hawley is a native of North Carolina
Each of them represents a doubtful State, the
electoral vote of which may become necessary to
Republican success. In their respective States
they are the favorites of their party. They
could command the electoral vote of these two
doubtful Commonwealths, and present as strong
a claim upon the two most hopeful Southern
States to become enrolled in the Republican
column as any other candidates that possibly
could be named.
Certainly no two public men can present
cleaner personal and public records, and against
whom so little could be said. They stand bo
fore the American people without reproach, and
would, in their personal character, disarm the
slanderer and rebuke the defamer, and invite to
a canvass freer from villification and misrepre
sentation than any through which we have
passed for years.
It is a notable fact that either one or the
other of these gentlemen is often mentioned in
connection with the presidential contest,
whether the head of ths ticket is suggested from
the East or West. Blaine and Harrisoo are fre
quently eoupled together, Sherman and Hawley,
and Allison and Hawley areas often mentioned,
and we see that Depew, cf New York, and Hsr
rison, of. Indiana, are presented as a popu
lar combination. But our correspondent
presents his own preference and that
of many others in the form of Harrison and
Hawley as the standard-bearers of the party in
1888. We have the most implicit confidence in
the Republican national convention, and are
satisfied that the convention of 188S will make a
wise choice when the time comes to nominate
the men, whether it shall be Harrison and Haw
ley or Blaine and Harrison, or Allison and
Hawley, or Depew and Harrison, or Sherman
and Hawley. A strong point for Harrison is
the belief that be could command the fifteen
electoral votes of his State, and equally as force
ful a reason favors Hawley, that be would be
certain to be supported by his State thus mak
ing sure of two doubtful States.
But these are mere conjectures, drawn out by
the suggestion of our correspondent. The
names will no doubt be thought over by many
Republicans in the country, and stranger t nines
have happened than their selection by the con
vention. Our correspondent is confident of the
success of such a ticket, and be may be but an
ticipating the judgment of the nation.
Itatler Prefers aa American.
New York, Dec. 9. D.in Butterfield re
cently wrote General Butler if he would ap
prove of the selection of the Comte de Paris to
deliver the address on the occasion of the re
union of the Arinv of the James, to be held next
July at Gettysburg. General Butler replied as
follows:
"Yours asking mv consent and signature to the
Comte de Paris to deliver the address at Gettysburg,
I aoswer by telegraph, as requested. I am t-oo
war of the rebellion to invite a Frenchman, who,
because he was a prince, was permitted to p!ay
iyr for his own agscrandizement on the staff f a
Nhanding general in that war, and who, as such
er. was at "one time at the head of that general's
aau of information, and for want of knowledge of
ti.j peculiarities of our people and the idioms of our
language, did his commander, as I happen to know,
great mischief. To speak for the armies of the
United States at the re-union at Gettysburg, I would
rather agrea to any officer of the rank of colonel or
above, who served throughj the war, to be such repre
sentative, of our soldiers."
Pauper Politics.
Chicago 5111.
Something ought to be done for the Indiana
poor-house superintendent who dragged fifteen
paupers to the polls and made them vote the
Democratic ticket, whereby the .Democrats ob
tained a majority in the I-gislatur and Turpi
was elected United States Senator. Iho
fellow lost his position in the poor-house in con
sequence of his partisan zeal, and he iow comes
forward with a claim for compensation in the
Fhape of a federal appointment. The President
bolieves in encouraging pauper labor; now let
him do something for the encouragement of
pauper politics.
Senator Turple's Beaaty.
Chicago Kews.
Indiana may not be proud of Senator Turpie,
but she can boast of him as the most beautiful
man who ever held a seat in that distinguished
body. He is only surpassed by Jo-Jo, the dog
faced boy, of dime-museum fame. When Sen
ator Turpie gets up to speak, the Senate clock
will stop. President Jc galls should use him as a
bugaboo, with which to frighten naughty little
Senators who misbehave. Senator Turpie is a
daisy.
A Natural Inference.
Chicago Journal.
The public schools of Indiana are being more
largely attended from year to year. This being
the rase, it is safe to guess that the State will
sot be Democratic much longer.
One Fact.
