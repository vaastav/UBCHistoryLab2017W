Chicago, Dec. 15. The erection of
-postoffice buildings throughout the
. country In towns which have only
Tented quarters and branch postof-
fjces In cities where more sub-stations
ere badly needed has been proposed
s an Investment of postal savings
bank funds that would eave Uncle
Sam millions of dollars every year,
would add handsome structures in
thousands of communities and would
give employment to hundreds of thou
sands of men, the sponsor for the
idea being Former United) States
Senator William E. Mason, of Chica
go, who has knowledge of the facts
as he waa chairman of the postoffice
committee in the United States sen
ate. "In Chicago, for instance," said
: Senator Mason In a letter to Chair
man Geo. H. Currier of the Postal
Savings Bank League which Is urg
ing the enactment of a postal savings
bill during this session of congress,
"the government would be able to
save not less than a hundred thous
and dollars a year by employing
funds deposited in constructing
the branch postoffice buildings which
are needed. The Investment of say
16,000,000 would cost in interest, at
the 2 per cent paid postal depositors,
' fully $100,000 less than the rentals
now Daid. Moreover it would give
employment to thousands of men and
put the money Into circulation. There
would be similar economies in other
cities and towns." The problem of
the Investment of deposits, which
the hostile banking Interests have
' held up as a bugr-a-boo against the
postal bank plan was one in which
President Taft In his message to con
gress dealt, with' decisively, saying:
"I believe postal savings banks to be
neoeasary in order to offer the pro
per Inducement to thrift and saving
to a great many people of small means
who do not now have banking facil
ities and to whom such a system
would offer an opportunity for the ac
cumulation of capital. The
question of how the money deposited

for this purpose was inserted as an

bulletin Issued by the Postal Ban
League it is said: "All membesr of

postal banks are urged without delay
to make it their business to write
to the members of the housa sub

War to Continue Against White
Slave Traffic.
A national organization to system
atlcally war against the white slave'
traffic has been practically complet
ed and the announcement soon will
be made that it be known as ' the
American. . Alliance, with headqjuart
ers in Chicago. State and local fed
erations of women's clubs, vigilance
and protective organizations and bar
associations, commercial bodies and
the churches will be asked to af
filiate or co-operate with thts alli
ance for a united, well defined plan.
Active aid will be given by this body
to the Mann bill in congress for the
new federal statute to which Presi
dent' Taft referred in his message to
congress, saying: "I greatly regret
to have to' say. that the investigations
made in the bureau of immigration
and other sources of information, lead
to the view that there 13 urgent
necessity for additional v legislation
and greater executive activity to sup
press the recruiting of the ranks of
prostitutes from the streams of Im
migration into this country an evil
which, for. want of a better name, has
been called the 'white-slave trade.'
I believe it to be constitutional to
forbid, under penalty, the transporta
tion of persons for purposes 'of pros
titution across national and state
lines, and by appropriating a fund of
$50,000 to be used by the secretary
of commerce and labor for the em
ployment of special Inspectors, it will
be possible to bring those responsible
for this trade to Indictment, and con
viction under a federal law." Efforts
will be made to secure the enactment
of new state laws by such legislatures
as convene this winter in states
where it is needed, as shown by the
investigation made by Assistant Unit
ed States Attorney Harry A. Parkin
during the summer. A digest of the
state laws of the country on this point
has just been issued by the Currier
Publishing company in a book, ''War
on the White-Slave Trade," which
was the final work of the Woman's
World committee, the nucleus of the
new national organization.
Usefulness of Public Libraries to Be
Increased.
Increasing the usefulness of a pub
lic library by adding branch libraries
is the urgent recommendation of Chi
cago's Public Library commission
and wealthy citizens- are looked to
for contributions for the purpose.
The need of library extension work
through branches Is declared to be
serious. The advisory commission was
composed of Harry A. Wheeler, pres
ident of the Credit Clearing House;
Thomas P. Holgate, dean of the Col
lege of Liberal Arts In Northwestern
University; George E, Vincent, dean
and professor of sociology In the
University of Chicago; N. D. C. i
Hodges, librarian of the - Cincinnati
public library, and president of the
American Library association, and J.
I. Wyer, Dr., director, of the New
York State Library. It has reported:
"The earlier conception (of a library)
was that of collection of books cov
ering as completely ' as : possible ev
ery department of knowledge and lit
erature, more stress being laid upon
having books than upon having them
used. The modern library idea is to
put the books as freely as possible
into the hands of the people." The
commission urges the use of the in
terest upon the $212,000 Endowment
Fund made up of gifts from private
parties, for the expansion of the li
brary service. This Interest fund now
amounts to $30,000. It Is also urged
that a portion of the bonds, author
ized by the last legislature, should be
devoted to this work. The present

What It Costs to Remove-Snow In
the Windy City.
Removing enow from Chicago pave
ments at $200,000 per inch of snow
is winter's burden on the street de
partments, for the superintendents of
which seventeen cities have .sent ap
plicants to the civil service contest
In which there 'are seventy-one con
testants. The annual cost of remov
ing thd enow from the streets in the
First ward, which includes the loop
district, is about $58,000. For several
years this work has been done by
the Citizen's association, but ft is
understood that after this year the
work will be turned back to the street
department Every snowfall costs In
the neighborhood of $5,000 an inch
to remove from the "loop" the cost
being rather high because of the ne
cessity for speed. When Chicago has
a two-Inch snowfall, as It had last
week, It usually requires less than
forty-eight hours to free the streets
In the business district of the "beauti
ful." This comparea very favorably
with the work In this line done In
Paris, where they still use the old
method of sprinkling the snow with
salt and trying to melt It. When this
works it causes so much suffering
among the horses, their feet becoming
frozen through constant standing and
working In the cold slush, that the
French people are beginning to pro
test against it. The Chicago method
is to sweep the snow into piles, and
then cart it off and dump it into the
river or lake. The new street superin
tendent will probably follow the same
course, as it has been found to be
the best.xand Just a'a economical as
any other, and far quicker. The new
street superintendent will draw a
salary of $5,000 a year and have the
expenditure of $3,000,000 of public
moneys annually. As a result of ef
forts of the City Club, which Insist
ed that the examination should be
open to outsiders, the civil service
commission complied and Chicago
hopes to have the best man for the
position that "could be obtained
throughout the entire country.
A Big Swindle Has Been Perpetrated

management, but John Dowdle, con
contractor, has admitted that fixed

separated from his money among all
the elegancies that could be expect

novel even in a city where the wits
of the -"con man", continually are
giving birth to something new in
quick and easy finance. Good clothes,
