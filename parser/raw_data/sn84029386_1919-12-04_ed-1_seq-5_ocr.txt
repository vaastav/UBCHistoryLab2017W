The Most Efficient Tractors and Power Machines
The Most Popular Plows and Tillage Implements
YOU know these trade names. Your father and grandfather
knew three of them. They knew in their time, and you know
today that these names stand for the highest quality farm
machinery in the world. McCormick built the first practical reaper,
Deering sold the first binder twine and was a good-twine pioneer,
and William Tarlin was one of the first steel plow pioneers. The
lines of harvesting machines and plows started by these farm
machine builders have been growing and developing ever since.
Other machines have been invented and developed by the same
manufacturers, and every new machine and implement has had
built into it the years of manufacturing experience and farm knowl
edge accumulated by McCormick, Deering, Parlin and their suc
cessors. Now all of these machines and implements have been
merged into one line the International Harvester. The reputation
of every machine and implement in this line is the same.
The Complete International Harvester Line
We Sell the International Line
What doe. this mean to you a. a farmer? It means, first o
all, that you can buy any farm machme or implement you
may need, right here in this town, without taking chances on
perent. or implements that might be "orphaned" one or
two' years after you buy them because of the manufacturer
going out of business. You can always get repairs or any
machine or implement in the' International line because the
Harvester Company will never go out of business, ou are
assured of reliable machines because every machine in the
Harvester line is tried out and tested under actual farm con
ditions, before being offered for sale to the farmer. The Ex
perimental Department of the Harvester Company ,s the
most thorough and active, institution of its kind.
It means, second, that you can get repairs and repair service
on all of these machines through one concern us. You don't
have to go to the bother and inconvenience of trying to get
repairs and service from half a dozen or more different com
panies. You won't be taking chances on expensive delays
waiting for repairs during the busy seasons because we arc
going to carry a big stock of repairs on hand and any repairs
that we might not have we can get for you in a hurry by a
'phone. call to the International Harvester branch house.
Tack this advertisement up in your machine shed so that
whenever you need repairs for any of your International
machines you will know where to go. Also, you will know
where to go when you are in the market for new machines or
implements of real quality and the highest operating efficiency

THE UNIVERSAL CAR
Insist on Genuine
Ford Parts
Imitation "Ford parts are being' sold by
many mail-order houses, down-town stores
and garages. to unsuspecting Ford owners as
"Ford" parts. But they are not Genuine Ford
parts used by the Ford Motor Company. They
are made by concerns who have no connection
whatsoever with the Ford Motor Company.
These imitation parts are not even made from
the same grade ot steel, or under the same
formulas used by the Ford Company. They are
counterfeit parts. Tests have shown them to
break when the genuine Ford parts didn't even
bend, and they generally are from thirty-five
to one hundred per cent lower in quality.
The Authorized Ford Dealer is your pro
tection. As such, we handle nothing but the
Genuine Ford parts. They are made from the
famous Ford Vanadium Steel and each part
according to its use-is heat-treated in the
wav that will give it'the longest wearing qual
ities. Every part is the same as it duplicate
in vour Ford car or Ford truck.
" Our stock of parts is complete. And our
Ford garage and Ford mechanics are at your
service at all times. Drive in when replace
ments or repairs for your ,Ford car may be
necessary. Save your car and also your money.

"will remove causes of political rest

peace times for emergency. a cold
storage law modelled after the law In
New Jersey, a law rfpiiring marks to
show the length of time funds are
kept in storage and a law to secure
