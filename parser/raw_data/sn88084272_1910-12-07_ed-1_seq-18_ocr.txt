Congress Must Crowd Much
Work Into A Short Period

Washington. J). C. Dec. 7. Upon tho ,
temper of the Democratic leaders de- .
pends entirely the amount and the ,
character of the legislation to be en- ;
acted into law at the present session
of the 61st congress President Taft
and his advisers have outlined an ambi
tious program. How much of it he may
be able to put through is a problem j
no one at this early day would be jus- ,
tified in predicting.
The country has heard much of the
rules of the house of representatives (
during the past two years. Within that .
period material changes have been .
made in the methods for controlling ,
the house. Among other things the ,
rules have been so modified by provid- j
Ing for specific performances that but
three days each week may be set aside j
for the general business of the house- j
The short session of a congress expires

months. It meets the first Monday in
December, and dies, automatically, -at
noon on the 3rd of March following.
This gives it but three months for ac
tual work, theoretically. As a matter
of fact, that time actually is much less. J
There usually is a holiday recess tnat
consumes a fortnight. -Adjournments
over from Friday to Monday cause a
loss of valuable time, and in the end,
by reason of these various causes, there
remain only about 60 working days for
the congress, reduced to quite half that
time in the house as a result of the new
rules. "Within this short space experi-
nee has proved that it is well nigh
impossible to do more than enact the
supply bills by which the funds are
provided for the maintenance and sup
port of the various branches of the
government.
May Hurry House But Hot Senate.
The foregoing, therefore, indicates
what ordinarily is the situation in con
rress during a short session. Special
rules providing for emerpencies are
possible in the house and there debate
can be limited and delay prevented. In
the senate there is nothing akin to
cloture, and so long as a single senator
desires to speak there is no way to
bring debate to a close. It is in the
senate, Therefore, that the danger
comes if obstacles are thrown in the
-way of an outlined legislative pro
gram. In the face of all this the ad
ministration has mapped out a pro
gram that will require the, most adroit
political and legislative management
to bring to fruition.

Republican leaders whose power in

1. Senator Henry Cabot Lodc, of Massachusetts, a prominent figure in
the upper house, who Is not likely to be returned to that body, when Mm term
expires next March.
2. "TTncIe Joe" Cannon, speaker of the house of representative for many
years, who will wield the gravel for the last time at the cominpr session of
congress. 1'he return of a Democratic majoritj in the house insures the
election of a Democratic speaker when the O-nd congress convenes in De
cember, 1011. t
3. Senator EiiRene Hale, of Maine, nho will hlii farewell to the senate
chamber at this session. At the lent election Malne elected p Democratic state
legislature, -which will elect a Democrat to the senate when Mr, Hale's term
expires In 3Iarch.
4. Senator Xelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island, for many years the most
powerful flsmre in" the "United States renate. who has announced that he will
not he a candidate for reelection when his term expires next .March.
H. "Champ'' Clark, of 3IUsourI. leader of the minority In the house at thl
session, and who is the most talked of candidate for the speakership, when
the Democrats come into power next December.
"t-
attention, in view of the result of the
recent elections, is the proposed reap-
portlonment. This is the determination ,
of the allntmpnt nf mmhiT-c nf tii i
house of representatives to the various j
states, based upon the population as- j
certained by each decennial census.
While this ought not to be a political '
question, it invariably involves poli- !
tics, and the Republicans are anxious '
to deal with it while they control both
houses of congress. It is not essential j
that this new reapportionment be en- '
acted Into law at this session, and if a I
bill considered unfair be submitted the
Democrats in the senate may be count- !
ed upon to prevent its conclusion before !
March 3.
Beis of Representation
The present representation is one
representative to every 134,182 of pop
ulation, making a total membership of
the house of 391. Upon the same fig
ures the membership of the house
thereafter would Tie enlarged material
ly. There is opposition to increasing

the size of the house, which already is ,
unwieldy, and the proposition will be

will bring about an increase of mem-
bership in some of the larger states, j
and result in loss in some of the less
thickly populated. It easily is seen,
therefore, why the Republicans are
anxious to deal with this subjefct and
retain whatever of political advantage
the situation may .have.
A big fight is promised with regard
to the tariff board for which the pres
ident asks a still larger appropriation
and, incidentally, increased authority In
the matter of conducting Its Inquiries
and making its investigations both at !
home and abroad. Many leading Dem
ocrats, like senator Bailey, for instance
are opposed to the tariff commission
plan and will antagonize this. Whether
thej- can do so to the end that consider
ation and final determination will be
postponed until the Democrats control
the house, remains to be seen. The I

legislation. ,
It does not appear likely that Aldrich
will be able to put through anj-thing
in the shape of a revision of the cur
rency laws at the coming session, al
though he has been credited with hav
ing that in mind. Time will be too J
short to admit of full and free consid
eration of so important a subject
3Iany Conservatlop .Schemes.
The administrations legislative plan
includes also various conservation
schemes, an anti-injunction 'bill giving
relief, in a measure at least, demanded
by organized labor, and a plan of pen
sion retiremert for aged civil employes
of the government. With the end in
view of forming a cohesive Republican
working force to accomplish that
which he has at heart, ,the president
has had several conferences with lead
ing regulars and progressives at which
his program has been thoroughlj
threshed out. The outlook seems to be
good for united action of all classes
of Republicans in the senate but as
has been intimated, the danger comes J
CASffu. stu&o.
congress will disappear nt the close

tagonize ail tnat Dears a political :s- j
Pect in proposed legislation.
The session mav not he without its
share of sensational incident. The
committee whicly investigated the 3al- j
l'nger-Plnchot controversy has con- (
eluded its labors and Its report is ready j
fcr tne consideration of the two houses J
of congress. By the majority of the j
Joint committee the secretary of the!
interior is exonerated; by the minority, !
including one progressive Republican, j
Pinchot is sustained, and the discussion
of the report doubtless will cause some j
sensational speeches in both houses.
Liorlmer Report Ready.
The Lorimer bribery chartres. arrow
ing out of the allegations that the Illi
nois senator was elected through the i
corrupt Use of money, were investigat- j
ed by a senatorial committee during
the summer and that report is ready.
The impression here is that the com

floor of th .tP ,c m, .

use of money and the offer of alleged
fees to certain men in the senate and
house for favorable action on legisla
tion pertaining to indian matters. Al
though the formal report of the com
mittee has not been made, it is under- i
stood that the conclusioA has been !
reached that the statements rest on
unwarranted accusations.

even, of the supply bills in these days
when economy is the watchword, and
the leaders -find it uphill work to prac-
tice economy in the face of the demands
of individual members, each laboring
zealously for appropriations of value
to his own district without regard to
the general welfare and unmindful of
the recommendations of the president
and- the efforts of department heads
to pare down the budget to the lowest
possible minimum.
What will happen when the new con
gress-comes into action is a problem to J
the solution of which neither Republi
can nor Democrat will now attempt to
apply himself. It is a question for the
future, and no answer is forthcoming.
Look for Extra Session.
Leaders among the Republicans, as
well as among the Democrats, are pre
dicting that events are tending toward
an extra session of the new congress,
either immediately on the expiration of
the next session, or early in the sum
mer. These leaders believe that if
president Taft does not call such a ses- I
sion for the consideration of a revision
of the tariff schedules that the Demo
cratic or Republican leaders may force
an extra session by holding up the
passage of the necessary appropriation
bills.
The Democratic leaders believe, at
least some of them, that an extra ses
sion for the consideration of the tariff
schedules would be fatal to 'the Repub
licans, because whatever the Democrat
ic majority in the house might do would
be blocked by the Republican senate.
Some of the Republican leaders sav i
that an extra session would be fatal
1 to Democrats on the Republican theory
) that the "Democratic party can be
counted on to do the wrong thing at
ine rjgnt time, ana tnat n tne lanii.
schedules are revised the Democrats
will make some kind of a blunder. i
However, if the Democrats should j
force an extra session by a filibuster j
I against the appropriation bills the
Republicans probably will not he espc- j
cially annQyed. Some of the Republican
leaders believe that an extra session j
will be the one thing needed to insure I
Republican success in the 1912 elec-
tions.
It is indeed seldom that two parties.
at the same time, believe that an ex-
tra .session will be of advantage to j
each. Everything done at the next ses
sion will be with an eye single to a '
point of advantage from which the
campaign to capture the white house
in 1912 can be conducted. It is fully
realized that the short session will
have the greatest weight in determin
ing which party will be victorious in
1912.
Democrats Confer.
While the Republicans are agitating i
the matter of an extra session, they j
probably will wait for the Democrats I
to make the first move towards that !
end. Leading Democrats are already j
conferring on the question of an extra
session. Some of the leaders believe
that it will be good "politics to force
an extra session, by a filibuster, and
then bring in a bill to revise the
whole tariff downward. Not however,
until coneress assembles, will confer
ences be held to definitely map out a '
plan of action. Republican leaders are i
equally 'active, but both parties will I
rest on their oars until the session ac- j
tually begins. I
Indications now are that an extra i
session win oe called, probably to be
gin immediately on the adjournment of
the regular session on March C.
Democratic leaders are counting on
the support of insurgent Republican
in the special session, if one is called,
in the revision of the tariff schedules.
Whether they will receive this support
is problematical.
The Presidents Message.
President Taft. who has been work
ing on his message to congress for
several weeks, had it ready for trans
mission as soon as the session opened. !
One of the most important recomrren- I
dations in the messace Is susrtrnst ed .
legislation changing the anti-trust law

That the Democrats intend to lose no !
time in getting ready for 1912 is shown j
by the recent call for a meetintr of the
national league of Democratic clubs, i
which will meet in this city Januarj 9.
1911. Only the executive board of the
league, which includes many senators
representatives and prominent politi
cians will take part in the delibera
tionsV but they will have the advice of
all Democratic leaders in the house and
senate. At the meeting plans will be
mapped out for the next two years
which will have much effect on the i
success of the Democrats in the elec- !
tions irt 1912.
Speculate on Nominee.
Speculation has begun among mem- t
bers of congress as to who will be the
Democratic nominee for the presidency ,
'n 1912- Three names are before the
democrats Wilson. Harmon and Dix.
Eacn of7 these will figure prominently
,n tne Democratic convention of 1912.;
Harmon, who has been in the public j
c-ve .lu,uei ,lMdn l"e otner two pros- j
Pective candidates, seems to be favored j
by a mairit5" of Democratic senators j
and representatives, though Dix is a ;

Bailey Aain In Line.
At the next session of the senate
there will begin a struggle among Dem
ocrats over the minority leadership for
the next congress. It will be three
cornered. Senators Culberson, Bacon
and Bailey are aspirants for the minor
ity leadership. Senator Culberson, who '
was the minority leader before he t
had to resign the position because of
illness, has recovered his health and
again desires to head the opposition in
the senate. Senator Bailey would like
