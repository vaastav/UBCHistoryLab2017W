Complete Statemat Pneented at a
Conference Last Tuesday
Officiate of the Bank of North Da
"kota mild memben of the State Bank
era* association met in informal ses
skm at Bismarck last Tuesday for the
purpose of discussing the financial sit
nation and formulating plans for im
I mediate relief.,
f, Contrary to expectations and for
tunately for all concerned, Cathro and
his associates decided to make a
Jf dean breast of things and lay all their
cards on the table, face up, placing
before the meeting a pomplete state
ment of financial conditions insofar
as tlwy affect the Bank of North Da
kota and private institutions with
I Which it is doing business. Three hun
dred bankers from all parts of the
S state were in attendance and much
good is expected as a.. result of the
-conference. Every effort waa devot-
I ad to the taak of getting together on
4 programthat will work for thebsn
of the whole state.
h-? Probably the most significant de
velopment was the announcement by
Sf. E. J. Weiser, president of {he First
%&?
r- c^Sf\ :v ^7
of Bank of North Dakota
Dedde to Ce-Operato With the
Fiaanders of the'State' *.,,,
National bank of Fargo, that he could
personally assure the bankers and pjso
pie of North Dakota that-the banking
interests of the twin cities and "the
east are prepared to stand bade of
and support every solvent bank in
the state. In reporting the outcome
of a conference held in Minneapolis
last Saturday
.which he attended, Mr.
Weiser stated that in that conference
he aiid his fellow North Dakota bank'
ers had btfeh assured that eastern in
stitutions are not Trnly willing to help
our banks but have already resume*}
loaning money on Nc# Dakota farm
mortgages. More |10040Q

vass of North Dakota banks to de
terming the amount of warrants, state
and (Otherwise, held by them, also the
amount "of fiwm mortgages carried.
Returns from about 500 banks show
ed that about f4,000,000 in unpledged
warrants and $4,0Q0,006 in farm mort
gages are held. Mr. Weiser said "we
considered the plan of pooling7these
warrants and isiming debenture bonds
against them, an4 when we put the
proposition up to the trust companies
of the twin cities they immediately
fill in line with the idea. -Thtjy be
lieved it could be 4one, and if that can
be carried out it will be the meins of
bringing money into the state."
The speaker believes the state ought
to go through with the construction
of the miH and elevator at Grand
Forks the farmers may determine
by actual demonstration whether or
sot the promotion of such an enter
prise is successful and would be of
benefit.
Mr. Macdowell, coming from the
conference at the Bank of North Da:
kota in which the atate administra
tion was mpresented by F. W. Cathro,
manager of the bank Wm. Lemke,
attorney general-elect Gov. Frazier
and Comniiasioner John N. Hagan,
members of the industrial coQuhik
sion, said that he had been assured
the administratiop would offer "no
new industrial program in the raining
session of the legislature, and that
there would be no attempt at repeals
ing the laws oassed by the peoi^e un
less such effort was initiated by
somebody else." Mr. HacDoweli ad
vanced the nroposition that it waa up
to tlie bankers to meet the state. Ad
ministration 'in a spirit of a1soIute
fairness for he felt that^ the state
officials were ready to .lay their
cards on the table. He said that the
bankers had been promised a state
ment showing how much inoney the
state bank has deposited in each coun
ty of the state, how much it has in
each bank in the state, and other in
fonnation regarding the' disposition
of public ftmds that would make it
pesiibto for the bankers to act intd

WILSON URGES TAX REVISION
Requests Congress to Figure Oat a
Workable Budget System
President Wilson's concrete recom
mendations to congress in his annual
message were:
Revision Of the tax laws, with sim
plification of the income and profits
taxes.
Independence for the Philippines.
A loan to Armenia.
Economy in government appropri

"of a workable. budgft system."
Cold storage and other laws affect

The- president did not endorse a
bonus for the soldiers.
Nowhere did thp president refer to
the League of Nations or the peMe
treaty fight except perhaps by infer
ence. in his opening when he quoted
Abraham Lincoln's "let us have faith
that right makes might and in that
faith let us dare to do pur duty as we
understand it." ."
At its close, the president wrote a
paragraph which might be regarded
as a valedictory, saying:
"I have hot so much laid before you
a series of recommendations
sought to utter a confession of faith
in which it waa bred and which it is
my "solemn purpose to stand by until
my last fighting'day. I believe this
to be the faith of America, the faith

"Democracy," the president said, "is

42ND WEDDING ANNIVERSARY
Important -Eveata in Life of Ihtni
F. Msrshall Called to Mind I
Saturday, Dec. 4, was the forty
second anniversary of the marriage
of Mr, and Mrs. Thomas F. Marshall.
They were married On a item of Mn:
Marshall's near Miasouri Valley a^d
at that time Mr. Marshall was eo^
ducting a retail grocery business ifc
the city of Yankton belonging to hi#
partner and himself.
Mr. Marahall dime to Yankton,, 8.
-fD., in the apring of 187S, having left
the .state normal school of Platte
ville,.Wis., three montha before gra4
uatihg on account of ill health anj
lade of funda. Forty yean- after
wards the board' of regents of tMs
school gave to. Mr. MarshaM an hon
orary diploma.. Mrs.. Marshall ia
graduate of the same institutions
When Mr. Marahall came to
kota he Jutd the ^promise of a
^a^ehainman with a 11. 8
«ewr"1^is crew^ however, was con
siderably delayed in going out and
in the meantime Mr. Marshall work
ed as a section hand on what waa then
known as the Dakota Southern rail-,
road,'from Yankton to Sioux City.
He afterwards took up the work of
surveying for which he was educated,
arid which he followed more or less
for fifteen years, doing considerable
work for the. government, In the
eighties Mr. and Mrs. Marahall moved
to Columbia, S. D., in order to be
nearer to Mr. Marshall's government
work.
In 1886 Mr. and Mrs. Marshall re
turned to Yankton- and the former
entered the grocery business. In 1886
he closed up his business there and in
January, 1887,-came to Oakes and
took the management and a substan
tial interest in what was then known
as the Bank of Oakes, which was
Owned by former, business associates
tf his. Soon afterwards H. C. Mc
Cartney, who 1a a nephew of Mrs.
Marshall's, then nineteen years old,
came from a Kansas farm and enter
ed the bank. In a few years Mr. Mar
shall bought out his associates and
established what is now known as the
Marshall-McCartney company. From
a .small beginning this company has
grown- to be recognised in financial
circles aa one of the strongest and
best Organised'institutions in the
country.
They organized what is known as
the Dakota Western Telephone com
pany, wife ten local exchanges,. in
cluding the city of Williston, and a
large mileage of long distance wires
in North Dakota and Montana. This
waa sold in: a few yeara to the North

pany.
At the prasent time the Marshall
McCartney company owns and oper
ates five banks, the First National

LEGION MEETS TUESDAY NIGHT
Many Matters Under Consideration at
Business Meeting
The local post of the American
Legion met in business session Tues
day evening at the Legion dub, on
call pt the post commander, E. A.
Bellinger, who presided.
The committee on dancea reported
that they have made arrangements
for dances on the 10th and 2Srd of
this month, and had secured options
on the hall for Lincoln'a and Wash
ington's birthdaya, and St. Patrick's
day. On being put to a vote, it waa
decided to inake the dance on Dec.
in the nature of a carnival affair.
Bootha will be arranged in the hall to
dispense confetti, streamers, paper
caps, etc., and the event will be turn
ed Into one grand and glorious riot ol!
After some discussion on the sub
ject it was decided to, put a lock on
the dub room door and furnish keys
to the members at cost, abont 30c, as
it was found necessary to take steps
to protect the privacy of the place.
Considerable comment pro and con
was aroused over the question as to
whether: members should be allowed
to bring outsiders into the club as
guests. A decision was finally reach
ed to exclude all but ex-service men.
The proposal to change the name of
the local unit from Howard Bean post
to Bean-Goodwin post, in order to
honor equally the only two service
men from Oakes to lose their lives in
the great conflict, met with unani
mous approval. The adjutant was in
structed to take the matter up with
state and national headquarters.
By acclamation the janitor work
was awarded to that effldent Knight
of the Broom and Mop, Frank Fos
ter, at-the figure named by the aaid
knight.
Argument waxed heated over the
motion to levy an assessment of 60c
a month on all members to meet cur
rent expenses. When the brickbats
and bouquets had quit flying, the
orators had run out of wind and tbe
smoke of battle finally cleared away,
it waa found that the motion had
lost. Dues will be $8.00 per year, as
before.
A post ritual, giving the method of
procedure for all meetings of the Le
gion and also a form for tfie initiation
of candidates, haa been prepared and
sent out by headquarters. The local
Xegionaires voted to adopt this, and
work under this ritual will be started
at the next meeting.
Neal Andrews was elected to fill out
the current term aa sergeant-at-arms.
"The Legion room is beginning to
present a real dub-like appearance.
The furniture buying committee
brought home the bacon in the ahape
of three large leather rockers, a
couple of smaller rockers and four
comfortable atraight backed chairs.
These, together with a settee donated
by Erik Buland, furnish comfortable
lounging facilitiea for a number of
men. The billiard table which the
Whist club so kindfr presented to the
Legion has been installed, and the
boys are truly appreciative of thia
gift A couple of the fellows got
busy the other day and raised suf
ficient money in a short while to buy
a set of billiard balls. These will be
hare.in a short time. The best-part
of it was that then was enough left
from the subscription for the billiard
bills to buy "Red" Turner a checker
board. The saints be praised!
The boys plan to add awn furnish
ings fkroQ time to time, and hope to
have the place fixed up in first clasa
style baton long.
E.R. Aspland, repreowting the
farm loan department of the Fergus
Falls, Minn* National bank, was in
tfca dty the last of the week. His
fins expeeta to invest money in North
Dakota nel estate mortgages aa soon
as the financial atmosphere dean up.
SHOP WITH OAKES MERCHANTS
Wonderful Stocks of Christaaa Geoda
Now On Display ,f,,
This is the time of year when ev
erybody ia confronted with the prob
lem of making purchases for Christ
"What shall I get him," "What
shall I get her," an questions which
must be solved within the next two
weeks, and every person must make
the decision himself, no matter how
much he would like to shift the re
sponsibility.
Money isn't so plentiful, perhaps, as
it was last year and the year before,
but when Yuletide rolls around most
people manage to scrape together
enough coin of the realm to get by
somehow. Besides, it isn't the intrin
sic monetary value of the gift any
way—it's the spirit in which the
presentation is made.
Most of our merchants an carry
ing Christmas advertisements in this
issue of the Times. Those who are
not will do so within the next two
weeks, because the best way to reach
the buying public is through the col
umns of the local newspaper, a fact
which ia'recognized by all good busi
r.esb men..
If in doubt as to just what to buy,
may we suggest that you look rare
fvhy through this newspaper,* scan
the ads with a critical eye, and you
are certain to find some things which
you will want to buy. Kvon in a large
advertisement it is practically im
possible to list more tn&n a few qt the
many articles a firm has for sale, but
one can gain a fairly good idea of
what to expect in the store after read
ing its message in the paper.
Timely news will be found in the
advertiaing section of the Times, a
point which it will be to the advan
tage of careful buyen to consider.

LEGION FUND
IS PROPOSED
Fargo Man Offers New Idea in Matter
of Financial Aid for
Service Men
ADJUTANT GENERAL FAVOR8 IT
Every Dollar Loaaad Backed by
Amount Due on State Bonus
Plans for a. "Legion savings fund"
for the ex-service men of North Da
kota who hold bonus claims against
the state, designed to end the sale
of bonus claima at big discounts, a
condition that now exists in the state,
wen submitted by Art F. Collar at
the annual meeting of Gilbert C.
Grafton post of the American Legion,
in Fargo Tuesday night.
The nsolution asked the command
er to appoint a committee of three
with power to put on a drive among
Legion men for deposits to create the
fund from which loans will be made
to the service men who an in need.
The pUra, which also encourages
thrift among the Legion men, has the
endorsement, of G. Angus Fraser, ad
jutant general of North Dakota.
The general featuns of the pro
posed scheme an that no loan will
be made which will exceed 50 per
cent of the bonus due the ex-service
man. Arrangements have been made
with the adjutant general'e office to
accept the-bonus claim assignments
and protect the proposed organization
which will be formed of ex-service
men. At the time that the man's
bOhus is due to be paid, the adjutant
general will draw two warrants, one
for the amount due on the assign
ment and the other for the balance
due the ex-soldier. Thus, every dol
lar which is loaned is backed by se
curity which is worth 100 cents on
the dollar.
"When a financial loan or obliga
tion ia made, the first consideration
is always the aecurity," said Mr. Col
lar. "It is my plan that these loans
to the ex-service men from the Legion
savinga fund be made only after a
very thorough investigation. It ia
hot my plan to make loans to anyone
who ia not in need of it or loan money
to anyone foolishly.
"In order to secure a loan the ap
plicant must at first have a resolu
tion drawn which will state all con
ditions which make a loan necessary,
why it ia necessary to make appli
cation for thia help aaid just how the
money will be expended."
Under Mr1. Collate plans, if car
ried the naohitioii will be turned
over to an investigating committee
for thorough investigation of the ap
plication, and apon approval, an aa
signment will be drawn and forward
ed to the adjutant general's office at
Bismarck with the osrlginal discharge.
This discharge will be stamped and
.endoraed by the adjutant general and
returned to the Legion fund organi
zation with his approval stamped on

NUMBER 48
COUNTY AGENT
MAKES REPORT
Farm Bureau Organisation Makes Re
markable Progress During the
Paat Twelve Montha
TO PUT ON MEMBERSHIP DRIVE
Congress to Be Made Acquainted with
Farmers' Needa
The executive committee of the
Farm Bureau met at H. J. Johnson's
office last Wednesday, December 1st,
at 8 o'clock p. m. Those present
were: W. W. Denning, N. J. Nelson,
A. H. Koch, E. J. Hubbard, Joseph
Pazandak, Arthur Struts, D. F. Muel
ler and A. C. Kuenning.
The county agent submitted his n
port for the year ending Nov. 30,1920.
The matter of putting on a Farm bu
rcau membership drive was discussed,
at some length and the concensus of
opinion was that this should take placo
the latter part of January or the first
of February, depending upon weather
and road conditions. The time will
also depend upon when proper assist
ance can be secured from the Agricul
tural college. It will be remembered
that the membership dues in the coun
ty organisation were raised to ?5.00
at the last annual meeting state dues
will also be $6.00 per individual. Thus
a $10.00 fee gives the farmer a mem
bership in the county, state and na
tional organizations. In some of the
eastern states the membership fee is
as high as $15.00. It is in these statea
that the most effective work has been
done. One of the difficulties with the
Farm bureau in the past has been thai
it was very backward in aisking for
funds with which to operate. Now.
they propose to finance their organiz
ation properly in order to enable them
selves to put across any legitimate
project which they may undertake.
While $10.00 appean to be a large'
amount at fint thought it is not large
in comparison with membership dues
in other organizations. If we desire
to employ experts, ropresentatives,'
delegates, paid secrotaries and men
to carry on certain lines of work for.
the benefit of the farmer, it is neces
sary to have funds. Talking prom
iscuously about our troubles on the
street corners1 and to our neighbon
does not materially help to relieve the
situation in any way. What we need
is a few paid lobbyists like Gray Sil
ver at Washington to represent us,
and a state secretary to conduct ref
erendum votes whenever the organiza
tion requires it in order that the com
mon sentiment of the farmer may be
obtained, and representatives at the
national capital instructed as to just
when the farmer stands and what he
demands. In the past the farmer has'
expected too much work for nothing.
The resulta an, he has gotten nothing.
So far as federal appropriation ia
concerned-, of the five billion dollan
appropriated by congress at the last
session only one-fourth of one per
cent is to be devoted to agricultural
extension work. The Farm bureau as
a^i organization cannot expect the na
tion to finance its program. The pro
gram must be financed by its own
members in the same way as the labor
organization. It does not depend on
the department of labor for financial
aid. Therefore, neither should the
farmers depend upon the department
of agriculture for funds that an to
be used in developing the Farm
bureau.
The county agent is in receipt of
letters from several, employment agen
des in the twin cities stating that
they have a large number of men
available for farm work. The wages
they an asking run all the way from
$26 to $40 per month.
A carload of D. 1 wheat was re
ceived at Guelph last week. Due to
the decline in the price of wheat, some
farmen have decided not to sell theire
and therefore an not in a position to
take all the wheat which they ordered
from this lot. This D. 1 wheat is the
equal or the superior of the Acme
wheat raised in South Dakota. While'
it. is not directly nlated to the Acme
it resembles the latter very much.
The D. 1 ia to be had in limited quan- ..
titles and it is questionable whether."
another carload will be shipped in even'
by next spring. While it is not aa
uniform in size and color of kernel
as some other varieties of wheat it ia I.1
nevertheless a good yielder and ia aa^
rust resistant as any we know of.
there an any ftemera who have a/
clean piece of ground on which they*
can raise this wheat, it will be pos
sible for the agent to allow them amall^l
amounts of from 10 to 60 bushels.
