A FIRE TRAP
IFlXl: The accompanying picture is a reproduction of
a photograph of the disastrous school fire in Cleve
land which cost the lives of 150 children.
State Architect, Liebbe, has started a crusade
against
hot air furnaces
in ^chools, claiming that
they not only m^ke firetraps of the buildings in
which they are installed, but prove
unhygenie,
Mr. Liebbe said:
"The first thing to do is to eliminate the hoc air furnaces. What
trouble have they not engendered. Home after home and lives by the
score have been extinguished by the red hot demon in tins cellar, to say
norfiing of the unhygienic inflow of life destroying air. they furnish
the hurtian hot house plants—the school children, who must breathe in
this vitiated air after it passed in thru a dirty air duct from off the sur
face of the ground, then embrace the hot demon and pass up thru all
sorts of flaea into the crowded school room to sicken, enervate, emaci
ate its occupants with the inevitable accompaniments of headache, lan
guor and debilitation.
"The proper warming and ventilation of'the school room or any
other habitation is no longer an unsolved problem. Its accomplishment
Is simple and usually perfectly safe by either hot vapor, steam, or
better still, HOT WATER."

A GREAT NEWSPAPER.
Readers of the Times-Republican re
ceived a groat newspaper in yester-
day's issue great in size and groat in
merit. Sixteen pages of eight columns jand
each or a total of l-'S columns of news-
cities of 50,000 to 100,000 Inhabitants. is
Almost sixty columns of news readingMf
matter, in the first place, taxed an ex-j
ceptional force of news writers to their jwUh
limit and there was not a man on the
editorial force who did not drag him
self home last night completely fagged
out. Sixty columns of news reading
makes 65,000 words to be set in type
for one day's issue and made necessary
working at night as well as day for
the 'compositors. Ihen the seventy
coJmuns of advertising which repre
sented Marshall town merchants to be
In the city class and published to the
world that MarshalltAwn was actually
booming, required the entire energy of
the whole ad force both night and day
besides the co-operation of other print
shops in the city to set the type. And
the business force, which gathered in
this business, ran after the oopy or
perhaps prepared it, knows now how
the tired clerk feels during a Christmas
rush. Every line in yesterday's issue of
the T.-R. was worth reading. There
was more there in actual ems of type
than wo.uid be contained in an aver
age book to be had at $1.50 at any book
store, and it was a,11 gathered, written
and published in one day's issue of a
newspaper. We call attention to these
things because the Times-Republican
enjoys the distinction of being the larg
est newspaper and having the largest
circulation of any newspaper in- the
world published in a town of 14,000
people. The reason for it is In the qual
Uv of the news service which it per
forms.
WHEN. ROOSEVELT SIDESTEPS.
Til- matters political, social and of
business. President Roosevelt is
straight up and down like a length of
pump piping but. it looks as tho :he
were dodging criticism when he as
sures the country that his big game
trip to Africa is to be taken wholly
in the interests of science and to the
benefit and pleasure of the Smithson
ian. In men who have felt the wild
lust of game killing the statement will
arouse suspicion that the president
feels the protest against killing for
sport and is trying to let himself down
easy.
Any man who has pursued game
knows the luro of the hunt. It is atavis
tic, and belongs to the primitive man,
the original animal. It means the ex
citement of the ehi'sc nnd the
f,urance in a
paper in a regular news issue has never ,1P[ressnry addition. As a strictly busi
before been attempted in a town of 14,- JUsg priMosition, tho argument Is in
000 people. It is seldom attempted in I
favor of reaj
M"Jjup
satisfaction of the kill at its eml. Mc-n
It is instinct more than science that
is sending Roosevelt half around the
world to drive soft nose bullets into
lions, tigers, elephants and the like.
He is going because he likes it. He
"deelights" in hunting with the zest of
a Sioux. If one desires specimens of
mountain Lions it is scarcely necessary
to chase them with dogs and kill them
wth butcher knives but tfiere is all
kinds of excitement in it. A conjmon
black bear is one of the most timid
and well understood of wild animals
there is no real occasion for specimens
of him and ho| is not dangerous ex
cept to sheep and beehives. However,
there is a world of hard work and hap
piness chasing lilm thru the cane
brakes and ending him with a bullet
as he stands among the dogs at bay.
Usually as men grow older they hunt
less for two reasons they see the
needlessness and the cruelty of such
killing and they find less fun in the
7
4
liard work of the chase. They are in
clined to find excuse for the killing
done atf sport. Perhaps that Is what
Mr. Roosevelt is trying: to do.
AN OPPORTUNITY.
A few weeks ag.i, in an Iowa town the
school house was destroyed by fire.
Fortunately no loss of life occurred.
Now the citizens and taxpayers are
talking of rebuilding. A town meeting
lias been held and the outeame of the
resultant discussion, Is understood by
the school board to be that the town Is
willing to expend the entire legal limit
of taxation, about $13,000 for a new
school house. Tills Is certainly a most
creditable showing for a town of Us
size. Furthermore there is a distinct
sentiment in the community In favor
of .building a "practically' fireproof
school house.
Why not build a school house that is
really, not "practically" fireproof? Con
tractors will infirm the school board
(hat for one-third more expense
a school house can 'be erected that can
not be set on fire, either from the inside
or outside. Supiosing the town taxes
itself $1,1.000. This amount will build a
school house large enough for present
and near future use. Rut with $13,000,
a genuine fireproof building, slightly
smaller can be put up, that will accom-
nu)(lftte the
present needs of the town,

Sec what happened. Out from the
shadow of the capitol rushes a bold
buccaner. He swoops down and seizes
the caravel of the Hull hope. Hull
must walk the plank or join the crew
before the mast. The Kidd and Black
beard of Iowa's navigable waters is
Dolliver.
Will the frail bark carry so heavy
a cargo? From the 'Mississippi up past
Des Moines and beyond Boone the riv
er is set with shoals and sandbars. It
is mighty risky navigation and a heavy
load. Will she weather Congressional
Cape, pass the Senatorial Bar and
bring Hull and Dolliver both to port?
The scheme whispers of navigable
waters for suckers.

The senate is on Roosevelt's trail
but shows very little desire to rush
and elos. with its game. In some
ways
who hunt quail feel a savage salisfac- almost human.

inherited savagery of the deer hunter.
It is sport, keen, cruel, bloody sport,
but it speaks to an impulse strong in
most men and born in every boy. It is
the old killing instinct that kept the
primitive man and Ills p&ck alive. The
boy with the .22 rifle, doing his best to
slay a robin or a lark is simply re
turning to first principles, even tho he
comes back with his teeth and claws
lengthened by the distance a small bore
