has received a letter from W. H. Titus,
residing in ElPaso County, stating that
on December 2 about twenty-five Mex

the soldiers put in an appearance the
cow boys asked them their authority
for crossing into Texas and driving off
cattle. The leader told them they had
better go back to camp. Titus asked
the Adjutant General for State Rangers
to protect the frontier. General King
replied that whatever aid they could
render would be freely given, but such
an invasion by foreign soldiers was
fully within the scope of the authoiily
of the United States army, and the
matter would be brought to the notice
of the President.

HI Views on Civil Ser
vice ltcform.
Washington, December 9. The first
message of President Cleveland was deliv
fered to both Douses of Congress yesterday.
jt is as follows:
To the Conokess op the United States:
Your assembling iB clouded bv a sense of
public bereavement, catlcd by the recent sud
den death of Thomn A. Hendricks. Vice Pres
ident of the United Stales. Tins distinguished
public services, nn complete integrity Slid
devotion to every duty and his personal vir
tues will find honorable record in
his country's history. Ample and
repeated proofs of the conflcence
in which lie was litld by hi countrymen,
were manifcrtcd by his election to offices of
tho most important trust and highest diguitv,
and at length, full of years and honors, helms
been laid at rest amid universal sorrow and
benediction.
The Constitution, which requires those
chosen to legislate for the people to annu
ally meet in the discharge of their solemn
trust, alJo require? the President to give to
Congress information of the state of tho
Union, and recommend to their considera
tion such measures He shall deem necessary
and expedient. At the threshold of a
compliance with thete Constitutional direc
tions, it is well for us to bear in mind that
our usefulness to the people's interests will
be promoted by a constant appreciation of the
Fcope and character of olir respective duties
ns they relate to Federal legislation. While
the Executive may lecomnicnd such meits
tires as he deems expedient, the re
sponsibility for legislative action will devolve
on Congicsfi. Contemplation of the grave
nnd responsible tuitctioiii- assigned to the
Executive binnches of the Government under
ttoe Constitution, will disclose the partitions
cf pom cr bet ecn our respective departments
ind theii necessary independence, ami also
the need for the exorcise of ail the power en
trusted to each in that spirit of comity and
t:o-onciatipn which is essential to the proper
fulfillment of the patriotic obligations which
rest n on us as faithful servants of the
people. The jealous uatchiulncps of our
constituency, a gr.-at and small, supple
meats their euirra-ics, and before the tribu
nal they establish every public servant should
be judged.
VOJIEIGN RELATIONS.
It Is gratifying to announce that the rela
tions ot the United Stitc3 with all foreign
powers continue to be friendly. Our posi
tion, after nearly a century Of successful
constitutional government, maintenance of
gecd faith in all ot our engagements, the
avoidance of complications with other na
tions, and consistent attitude toward the
Strong and weak alike, turnili proof of tl
political disposition which renders profes
sions of good will unnecessary There are no
questions of difficulty pending with any for-t-if-n
Government. Tho Argentine
Government h.s revived the lonir Unr
inant question or the FulUlnnd Isl
ands by claiming from the United States
indemnity for their los attributed to the
potion of the commander of the sloop
Lexington in bicakiug up a uirat'cal colonv
on those islands in lS-il, and their subsctlltcn't
occupation by Great l.'r taiti. Jn view of the
lon and the dcielict condition of the islands
refore and alter their alleged occupation by
Argentine Colonists, tin's Government con
siders the claim as whoily groundless.
THE KKir.KV CASE.
A question has risen with tho Government
of Austr.'a-IIungnrv touching thO leprcscii
tntiouof the Ur.ittKl States at Vienna; hav
ing under inv constitutional picrogativc ap
pointed an estimable citizen of unlmpcached
rrobity and competency, as minister at that
court, the Government of Austria-Hungary
invited this Government to cognizance of a
certasn exception based upon allegations
against the personal acceptability of Ml.
Kcilcy, the appointed envoy, asking that in
view thereof the appo'ntnicnt should bo
withdiawn.
The reasons advanced were sUch ns could
not be acquiesced in without violation of
my oath or office and the precepts of the
Consittit'on, einco they necessarily in
volve a limitation in favor Of a for
eign government upon the right of selection
by the Executive and required such
an application of a religious test as a qualifi
cation for office under the United Slates as
Would have resulted m the practical disfran
chisement of a large ci:i?s Of our citizens
ar.d the abandonment of a vital principle in
our Government, The Aut,troHungariau
Government linally dec ded not to receive
Jlr. Ue le as the Envoy of tho United
States, and that gentleman has since resigned
ins eomin.ssion, leaving the place vacant.
I have made no new nomination and the in
terests of this Government at Vienna are
now in the care ol the Secretary of Legation
acting as charge d'affaires ad interim.
CENTRAL AMERICAN TIlOURLKSt
Early in Match last war bioke out in
Cential America, caused by the attempt of
Guatemala to consolidate the several
States into a single government. In these
contests between our nc'j-hbor.ng States
the United States foreborc to interfere act
ively, but lent the aid of the r friendly of
fices in deprecation of war to promote peace
and concord among the belligerents and by
Bisoh counsel contr butc immirtinllv to tho
preservation of tranquility in that locality.
I'hc emergences giowing out of tho civi
war in me fnited states of Colombia, de
manded of the Government at the bcg.nning
of this Administration the emplovment of
an armed force to fulfill its guarantees un
ucr tlie.thirty-fifth article of the treaty of
1WG, mi order to keep the transit open across
the Isthmus of Panama. Desirous of exer
f sing only the powers expressly reserved to
us by the treaty, and m ndhil of the rights of
Colomb a, the forces sent to the Isthmus
wcie inofructtd to confine their action
to "positively anl efficaciously" preventing
tnetiansit and its accessories from being in
terrupted cr embarrassed.
The execution of this delicate and reponsi
ble tr.t-k necessarily involved police con
trol where the local authority wr.i tem
porarily powerless, but always in aid
ot the Govcreiirntv of f'nlnmhi.i. Tim
piompt and successful fulfillment of its
duty by this Government was highly appre
ciated by the Government cf Colombia, and
has been followed by an expression of talis
taction. High praise is due to the officers
and men engaged in tl i service. The lestor
ntiou of peace on ilie Isthmus by the re-cs-ts'bJishnientof
the constituted Government
there being thus established, the forces of the
United States were withdrawn.
Fending these occurrences a question of
much imporlnncc was presented by decrees
of the Colombian government proclaiming
the closure or certain ports then in the
hands of insurgents, and declaring vessels
held by the revolutionists to be piratical and
1 able to capture by any power. To ne.thcr
of these proposit cms could the United States
submit. An effective closure of ports not in
the possession of the government, but held
by hostile pai ties, could not be recognized.
Nether could the vessels of in-uirgcnts
cgaiust tliclejrit.matesovnreiiriirvhrwif.i.mrxi
hostis humani generis w.'thin the precepts of
international law, whatever might be the
rtelinition and pcnaltv or their acts under the
municipal law of the State against
whose authority they were in revolt. The
ilen al bv this Government of the Colombian
proposition did not, however, imply the ad
mission of a belligerent status on the part of
the insurgents. Tho Colomhhin nnrirnimnt
has expressed its wiihngness to negotiate
conventions for the adjustment by arbitra
tion of claims of foreign cit zens arising out
of the destruction of the city of Aspiuwall
by the insurrectionary forces.
THE ClIINLSE QUKSTIOJJ.
The condition of the Chinese question in
the Western States and Terntor.es is. de
spite this restiiettve legislation, far fiom be
ing satisfactory, 'lhe recent outbreak in
V, yommg Tnrritcry.where numbers of unof
fending Chinamen, indisputably within the
protection of the treaties and the lnii-
muidcicdbya mob, and the still more re
cently threatened outtrenk of the same
charactcrin Washington Territory, are fresh
u the minds of all, and theie is apprehension
lest the bitterness of feeling against the
fliongolian race on the Pacific slope may find
vent in s milar lawless demonstrations.
All the power of this Government should
be exerted to maintain the amplest good
ruith to-.A ard China in the ti eatment of these
men. and the int!ex-illo stfrmmsa nf tim ion,
in bringing the wrong-doers to justice should
be Insisted on. Every effort has been made
by this Government to prevent ths-e violent
outbreaks, and to aid the representatives of
China in their investigation of these outrages,
and it is but just to say they are traceable to
lawlessness of men not citizens of the United
states, engaged in competition with Chiuese
laborers. Kacc prejudice is the chief factor in
originating these disturbances, and It exists ia
large part of our domain, jeopardizing our
domestic peace and the good relationship
we strive toma'ntain with China. The ad
mitted risht of a government to prevent the
influx of elements, hostile to its internal
peace and security may not be questioned,
even where there is no treaty stipulation on
the subject. That the exclusion of Chinese
labor is demanded in other countries whero
(e conditions prevail, is strongly evidenced
n the Domino.u of Canada, vhoro Chinese
mmigratiou is now regulatM by laws more
exclusive than our own.
If ex'stins laws are inadequate to compass
the end In view. I shall be prepared to give
sqnsideration to any further remedial meas
ures within the treaty limits, which the wis
Jom of Congress may devise.
PORK KESTR1CTIOSS.
I regret to say that the restriction? upon
the importation of our pork into Trance,
notwithstanding tbc abundant demonstra
t.on of the abseuce of sanitary danger in Its
use continues, butl entertain strong hopes
that, with a totter understanding of the mat-.
.'or, thlBTMRtfous prohibition will bo 're.
MOTca, , It would be nisosiDff to ho Rbig to say
and other countries where such food
products are absolutely excluded without
present prospect of a reasonable change.
The interpretation br oiir existing treaties
of naturalization by Germany during, tiio'
past year has attracted attention by reason
of ab apparent tendency on the part of the
iinperial government to extend the scope of
their rcsideutal restrictions to which return
ing naturalised citizen's of German orig.in
are asserted tt. be liable under the laws of the
empire. The temperate and just attitude
taken by this Government with regard to this
class of questions will doubtless lead to A
satisfactory understanding.
liuiTlsn GOOt) WILL.
The marked good will between the United
Slates and Great Urita n has been maintained
during the past vcar. The termination of
the fishery cauce of treaty of Washington
In pursuance of the jo'nt resolution of March
U, 1!SI, niuut have resulted in the abrupt ces
sation on the 1st of July of thi3 year, in the
midst of their ventuics, of the operations of
citizens of the United States engaged in null
ing in British American waters, but for a
diplomatic uhderstaridirig with her Majesty's
Government in June last, wherobv- an assur
ance was obtained that no interruptions Of
tnese operations should take place during
the current fishing season.
FtSHKtlY QUfeSTIOSS.
Tn the interest of good neighborhood and of
the commercial intercourse of adjstccr.t com
munities the question of the North American
fisheries is one of much impoitnnce. Follow
ing out the intimation given by me
wlfyd thj extensrtry arrangement above de
scribed wib negotiates, I renommend
that the Congress provide lor
the appointment of a commission, in
which the Governments of the United States
and Great Iliitain shall be respectively repre
sented, charged with the consideration and
Settlement, Upon si joint, equitable and honor
able basis, of the entire question df the fish
ing rights of the Governments and their re
spective citizens on the coast of the United
States and British North America.
The tishirig interest, being intimately re
lated 10 other general questions dependent
upon contingency and intercourse, cons del
ation thereof in all their cquit es might also
properly come within the purview of such
coihtniss on, and the latitude of expression
of both sides should be permitted. The cor
respondence in relat.oii to the fishing r.'ghts
will be submitted.
EXTRADITION.
The Inadequacy of the existing anange
ments lor extradition between the United
States and Great liiitnin has long been ap
pilient. The tenth article of the treaty of
18J2, one of the eailiCst compacts in this re
gnfd entered into by us, stipulates for tho
suricudcr in lespcctof a limited itumbtir of
offentes. Other crimes no less inimical to so
cial welfare should be embraced and the pro
cedure of e'tiudition brought in harmony
with tlie present international practices. Re
lations with Her Majesty's Government for
an enlarged tieaty ol extradition havfc been
pending simc 1870, nnd 1 entertain strong
hopes that a satisfactory result may soon be
atttthuid.
THK ALASKA filtl&tfiilt.
The frontier line between Alaska alld
British Columbia, as defined by the treaty of
cession with Kussia, follows the demarka
tion ass gned in a prior treaty between Great
Britain and KUssiti. Modern exploration
discloses thai this uTicient udlimlnry is im
practicable as a geographical fact. Hi tho
unsettled condition of that region the ques
tion has lacked importance, but the discov
ery of illiberal wealth in the terr.too' the
litife is supposed to" t inverse, adiiioriishos its
that the time has come when an accurate
knowledge of the boundary is needful
to avert jurisdictional complicat ons.
I lcbmmcnd, therefore, that pro
vision be made for a preliminary
1-econnoisnnce by oilicers of the United States
to the end of acquiring more precite inform
ation on the subject. I have invited Her
Majesty's Government to consider with us
the adoption of a mr-re convenient line to be
established by meridian observation or by
known geographical features without the ne
cessit3'Of an expensive survey of tho whole.

udoii and will shortlv bn submitted to Ihp
Senate for ratification.
NatupAlizatiok.
The inadequacy of oxiBting legislation,
touch'ngc.tizonship and naturalization, dc
lmiuds your consideration. While recogniz
ing the r.ght of expatriation no statutory
provisions exist pinviding means for re
nouncing cit zenshipbv an Amcrcan citizen,
native born or naturalized, nor tor termin
ating and locating an improper acquisition
of cit-zenship even a fraudulent decree of
natural zat:on can not now be cancelled.
The privilege and franchise of American
citizenship should be guarded with care and
extended to those only who intend, in good
faith, to assume its duties and responsibilities
when attaining its privileges and benefits.
It should be withheld from those who merely
go through the forms of naturalization with
the intent of escaping the duties of their orig
inal allegiance without taking upon them
selves tlioc of their new status, or who may
acquire the rights of American citizenship
for no other than a hostile purpose toward
their original Government. These evils have
had many Hagriuit illustrations.
I regard with favor the suggestion put
forth by one of ray nrcdecessors that provis
ion may be made lor a central bureau of rec
ord of the decrees of naturalization granted
by the various courts throughout the United
States now invested with that power. The
rights which spring from domicile in the
United States, especially when coupled with
a declaration of intention to become a citizen,
are worthy of definition by statute. The
stranger coming with either intent to rcma in
establishing his residence in our midst, con
tributing to the general welfare and by his
voluntary act declaring his purpose to as
sume the responsibilities of citizenship, there
by gains an inchoate status which legislation
hi's not properly defined.
Tho laws of certain States and Territories
adm t a domiciled alien to the local fran
chise, confcir.tur on him the rights of
citizenship to a degree which places him in
the anomalous position of bcinsr a citizen of
a State and yet not of tho United States
within the purview of Federal and interna
tional laws. It is important within the Scope
f international legislation to define this right
of alien domicile ns distinguished from Fed
eral naturalization.
THK DIPLOMATIC SERVICE.
I earnestly urpo that Congress recast the
ftppropr."at"on for the diplomatic and consu
Inr service on a footing' commensurate with
the importance of our national interest at
every point where a representative is neces
sary. The salary should bo eo graded as to
permit him to live with comfort. Witn tne
assignment of adequate salaries the so-called
national extra official fees which our officers
abroad are now permitted to treat as person
al perquisites, should be done away with.
THE TKEASUKY.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
fully exhibits the condition of the public
finances, and of the several branches of gov
ernment connected with his department. The
suggestions of the Secretary relating to prac
tical operations of these important depart
ments, and his recommendations in the direc
tion of simplification and economy, particu
larly in the work of collecting customs du
ties, are especially urged upon the attention
of Congress.
The ordinary receipts from all sources for
the fiscal year ended June 30. 1835. were J32&

THE TARIFF.
The fact that our revenues are In excess of
tho actual needs of an economical adminis
tration of the Government justifies a reduc
tion in the amount exacted from the people
for iM support . Our Government is but tha
means eSlttblished by the w.ll of a free peo
ple by which certain principles are applied
which thtiy have adopted for their benefit
and protection, and it irt never better admin
istered and its trtte spirit ia never bettor
observed than when tile people's taxation
for its support is scrupulously limited to the
actual necessity of expenditure, and dis
tr.butcd according to a just and equitable
llnh.
We shoifid also deal with the subject in
such a manner as to proic.t the interests of
American labor, which IS the capital of our
workingmen. Its stability and proper re
muneration furnish the most justifiable pre
text for a protective policy. Within these
limitations a certain reduction should be
rtads in our customs revenue. The amount
of such reduction Having been determined,
the inquiry follows where can it best bo re
mitted and wllat articles can best be re
leased from duty in the interests of our citi-
I think the reduction should be made In
the revenue derived from a tax upon the
imported necessaries of life. We thus
directly lessen the cost of living in every
familv of tho land, nnd release to the
peopfe in every humble homo a larger meas
ure of the rewards of frugal industry.
NATIONAL BA?KS.
During the year ended November 1, 1835,
145 National banks were organized, with an
aggregate capital of 510,933,000, and circula
tion notes have been irslled to them amount
ing to 54,274,910. The whole number of these
banks in existence on the day above
mentioned was" 2,727. The very limited
amount of circulating notes issued
by our National banks, compared
with the" amount the law tiennit them to is
sue upon rt deposit of bonds for their re
demption, indicated that the volume of cir
culating medium maybe largely increased
through this instrumentality. Nothing more
important than tho present condition of our
currency and coinage can claim your atten
tion. Since February, 1877, the Government
has, under compulsory provisions of law,
nurchttsed silver bullion and coined tho
same at the rato of more than 52,000,000
every month. Dy th's process, unto present
date 213,759,435 silver dollars have been
coined.
THE SltiVEft QUESTION.
A reasonable appropriation or a dslegation'
of power to the general Government would
limit its exercise without express restrictive
words to the people's needs and the require
ments of the public welfare. Upon this
theory tho authority to "coin money" given
to Consress by tho Constitution, if it permits
the pdrchas" by the Government of bullion
lor coinage, in any cventdoes not justify such
purchase and coinage! beyond the amount
needed for a sufficient circulating medium.
Th desire to utilize the silver product of tho
country should not lead to a misuse or the
perversion of this power.
The necessity for SUrh an addition to tho
silver currency of the Nation, tw is compelled!
by the silver coinage act, is illustrated by the
fact that up to the present time only about
511,000,000 of silver dollars so coined have actu
ally found their way into circulatiou, leaving
more than 5165.000.000' in possession of tho
Government, the custody of which has en
tailed a considerable expcnsO for construc
tion of vaults for its deposit. Ag.iifist tbfcj
latter amount there are outstanding silver
certificates of about 593,000,000.
Every month 52,000,000 of gold in t" le pub'
lie treasury arc paid out for 52,000,000 or more
of silver dollars to be added to the idle mass
accumulated. If continued long enough
this operation will result in a substitution of
silver for all the gold the Government owns,
applicable to its genernl purposes. It will
not do to rely on tho customs receipts of the
Government, the silver thus coined having
been made a lctral tender for all debts aud
dues, public and private. At times during
the last six months 5S per cent of tho receipts
for duties have been in silver or silver certifi
cates, while the average within that period
has been 10 per cent.
The portion of silver and its certificates re
ccived by the Government will probably in
crease n time goes on, for the reason that tho
nearer the period approaches when it will be
oblia-cd to otfer silver in navment of its obli
gations, the greater inducement there will
be to hoard gold against depreciation in the
value of bilver, or for tho purpose of specu
lating. Tnis hoarding ot gold nas already
begun. When the time comes that gold has
been withdrawn from circulation, then will
be appar.-nt the difference between the real
value of the silver dollar" and a dollar
in gold, and the two coins will part com
pany. Gold, still the standard of value and
necessary in our dealings with other coun
tries, will be at a premium over silver. Banks
which have substituted gold for the deposits
of their customers may pay them with
silver bought with such gold, t litis making a
handsome pioilt. Rich speculators will sell
their hoarded gold to their neighbors, who
need it to liquidate their foreign indebted
ness at a ruinous premium over silver, and
tho laboring men and women of the land,
most defenselese of all, will find that the dol
lar received for the wages of their toil ha
sadly shrunk in its purchasing power.
It may be said that the latter result will be
but temporary, and that ultimately the price
of labor will be adjusted to the change. But
even if th!s takes place the wnge-woTker can
not nossiblv train, since the Drice he is com
pelled to pay for his living will not only be
measured in a coin heavily depreciated, fluc
tunt'ngand uncertain in its value, but this
uncertainty in the value of the purchasing
medium will be made a pretext for an ad
vance in prices bcyoud that justified by the
actual depression.
The words uttered in 1834 by Daniel Web
ster in the Senate of the United States are
true to-day "The very man of all others who
has the deepest interest in a sound currency
ana wno suners most uv miscmcvous legis
lation in monoy matters is the man who
earns his daily bread by his daily toil." The
most distinguished advocate of bi-metalism,
in discussing our silver coinage, has lately
written: "So American citizen's hand
has yet felt the sensation of
cheapness either in receiving or
expending the" silver act dollars."
and those who live by labor or legitimate
trade never will feel that sensation of
cheapness. However plenty silver dollars
may he, they will not be distributed as gifts
among the people, and if the laboring man
should receive four deprec'ated dollars
where he now receives two, ho will pay in
the depreciated coin more than double tnc
Drice he now pays for all tho necessaries and
comforts of life.
Those who do not fear any disastrous con
sequences arising from the continued com
pulsory coinage of silver, as now directed by
law, and who suppose that the aC&ition of the
currency of the country intended as its re
sult will be a public benefit, are reminded
that the point is easily reached In the attempt
to float at the same time two sorts of money
ofydiffercnt excellence when the better will
cease to be in circulation. The boarding of
gold, which h&3 already taken plaoe, indi
cates that we shall not escape tho ussal
experience in suoh cases. So if ttii sil
ver coinaso bo oontlnued. vm may roRsrm.
