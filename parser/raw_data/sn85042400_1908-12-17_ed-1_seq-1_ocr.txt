CHICAGO, Dec. 16,-The tipping

commerce commission.
General Manager Dean testified
that the tipping custom is a' result
of selfishness of persons who want

ary was paid to a porter. Dean said
they were paid $25 per month.

CARACAS. Dec 14, via William-
stad, Dec. 16. The people of Cara
cas arose today against President
Castro. An infuriated mob, unhin
dered by the police, swept through
the city, wrecking the property of hi
henchmen and his closest friend.
The people rounded up all the sta
tue an pictures of President Castro
from the clubs and other semi-public
buildings and burned them on the
boulevard de Plaza. President Cas
tra's rule in Venezuela is probably
ended.
Further dangerous demonstrations
are anticipated. No official act, depos
ing Castra from the Presidency of
Venezuela has yet been taken, but
such a step is expected any moment.
An enormous crowd of the inhabit
ants of the capital, swelled by people
from the outlying country, gathered
in the streets soon after daybreak.
The people began marching up and
down to the main thoroughfares, and
it was easy to see that the ill-temper
would result in violence. The police
stood by and made no attempt what
ever to restrain the mob. The first
building to be attacked and looted
was that of the lottery monopoly.
The offices of the state enterprise
that has enriched itself at the ex
pense of the people were ransacked
and pillaged. Furniture was broken
and thrown into the streets and piles
of lottery tickets were destroyed. The
crowd then moved to the printing
office of El Constitutional, the organ
of President Castro, of which Gumer
sindo Rivas is editor, and pillaged it
completely. A steam laundry belong
ing to Scnor Rivas was wrecked.
The crowd then turned its atten
tion to several drug stores belonging
to Senor Thielen, a son-in-law of
General Tello Mendoza, and turned
them inside out. General Mendoza
at one time minister of finance
under Castro, and one of his staunch
cst supporters. He is universally
hated by the enemies of Castro, and
his unpopularity and his close con
nection with the President accounted
for the anger of the populace against
the property of his son-in-law.
The statues and pictures of Presi
dent Castro were, made into a huge
bonfire on the Toulevard dc Plaza.
Numerous inscriptions setting forth
the virtues of Castro, and extolling
his powers next attracted the mob,
and every inscription was hacked out
and erased. Some of these legends
were carved in the public buildings
of the city.
It was after 1 o'clock by the time
the crowd had got thus far in its
depredations. It was then th'at a de
tachment of troops was tailed out
for duty on the city streets, and Act
ing Governor Gomez issued a mani
festo prohibiting further manifesta
tions. These measures had the desirel
effect, for the mob quieted down and

INSANITY GROWS FAST.
CHICAGO, Dec. 16 "Insanity
grows three times as fast in propor
tion as the increase in population in
the United States."
Dr, David Paulson, president of the
Anti-Cigarette League, made this
statement yesterday. "China," he
continued, "used 26 grains of opium
last year for every man, woman and
child. The United States used 56
grains. There are at least 1,000,000
opium users in this country." ,

defense, "For through him we would
have shown that he (Tonning

ing, with a boathook or oar and that
to protect his. brother, Thornton
Hains drew his revolver."

ternoon and Mclntyre Sought to shpw
that Thornton had said after the
shooting that he fried to dissuade
Captain Hains from his act and that
he would hold him until the officers
came, bpecial rrosecutor vvnite de
clared that vedince would be brought
out to show that Thornton Hains,
had full knowledge of his brother's
intention to kill Annis and virtually
led the way to the yacht club and di
rected a search for the publisher.

COUNT WITHDRAWS
REQUEST FOR COIN
De Castellane Makes Clever Hove When He Learns
That His Requested Allowance Injures His Case .
PARIS, Dec. 16 The last day of
hearing of the suit brought by Count
De Castellane against his former
wife, Princess De Sagan, for custody
of the three children brought out the
fact that the Count has withdrawn
his demand that the court allow him
a yearly income of $60,000 for keep
ing the children. M. Bonnet, speak
ing for the Count read a letter from
his client protesting against the
charge having been instittued in the
proceedings to obtain money and
abandoning his claim for the allow
ance. He insisted that his only mo
tive was moral and physical welfare.
It is evident that the Count has
recognized that the claim for a large
allowance has injured his case in the
eyes of the court and estimation of
the 'public, and his tardy denuncia
tion is considered a clever move to
enlist interest in his favor. v Never
theless, the public is greatly, astonish
ed that the Count should go to such
an extreme.
Next week the public prosecutor
will present his conclusions and the
court will then render its decision
dismissing the Count's plea or grant
him custody of the children. The
princess continues sanguine of the
decision,'
