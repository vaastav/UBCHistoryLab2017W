It will I>«* interesting tv Kee bow The
Oklahoma officials nieel th" situation
cau***] by the suspension of two more of
the state's guaranteed banks. The two
lit -■• suspensions < ccurred in a chain of
banks run by the president cf the Co
lumbia Bank and Trust Company of Ok
lahmmn City, which H<;sed its doors on
September 29. That bank was the largest
in Oklahoma, baring £3.000.000 in depos
its. Its growth appears to have been
rmrshrm>m-15ke. for a year before its
d»-j« ■ were only $3u5,C(Kh Such an
Increase was an instance of the benef
icent results of tbe jruarautee system, if
ye arc- to Itellcve various statements
that emanated from Oklahoma before
the trouble came. And certainly the
Ntate appears to have regarded the flour
ishing Columbia Bank with much favor,
fcince at the time of its failure ii held
SIBD.OOO of state deposits, besides J73.000
of the guarantee fund.
The failure of the Columbia exhausted
tLe fund, erbid of course; fell lar short
of paying tbe liabilities. Bank Conunis
sioner Young <>i Oklahoma iaamsd a
Btgtement on October 3<» showing thai
be had paid $503,647 to depositors from
the guarantee fund and M.!'5."..i>47 '.'7
from the assets of the bank. About
$SOO,OOO was still due to the depositors.
Thus the guarantee fund did not result
in the prompt payment in full of de
positors, and, indeed, It is understood
that some of the bank's liabilities re
main unpaid even now. All that is now
claimed for the Oklahoma system of
handling a failed bsnk Is remarkable
speed In liquidation. But a dispatch to
"The Omaha Bee," to which we are In
debted for th*"- facts. 6bows the method
by which the assets were quickly turned
' ov«-r r.iid claims settled. The quick
wor*-. it says, has been due not only to
collections and to sale of collateral**, but
to "settling with depositors by turning
over to thecn bills receivable." That Is.
tbe do[H>.»ii'trs accepted th» papei in the
* bank's, portfolio in payment of their
claims. A ■'cry goad showing Ie liqui
dation can be made if depositors of I
bankrupt Institution accept its paper
at face value and take their chances
jwitb It instead of kskftsg their chances
fctreugn WElutig for the receiver to col
lect upon it. As a mere matter of book
keeping a large and quick realization
upon assets is possible in thar way.
Another novelty exhibited in the set
tlement., ie also described in the same
dispatch to "The Bee." "The only
"difference from the procedure In un
"guaranteed banks," It says, "is that
"instead of applying the money Recured
"on assets r rfi ra a to all depositors of
"the institution. Bank Commissioner
"Young is paying certain depositors first,
"while others nre waiting, willingly or
"otherwise!" This means, we suppose,
that the jtlepositors who were willing to
take the bills receivable from the port
folio at or near face value got them,
while those who wanted money had to
wait.
At this distance it looks as if there had
been a siTHinMe to make a record in
settling up the affairs of the bank
promptly, so as to show as good a ease
as possible for the guarantee law. The
method adopted gave every opportunity
for favoritism sod irregularity to enter
into the liquidation, and it Is not sur
prising that there was much dissatis
faction. The grand jury went into the
matter of the liquidation, but Governor
Haskell took it out of iis hands, on the
ground that the proceedings before it
were an attack upon the guarantee law.
net an attempt to administer justice.
With the guarantee fund exhausted. It
will be Interesting to see what will be
accomplished in the way of "rapid
liquidation" of the banks now in trouble
.•iiid how it will be accomplished.
KXIT ZELAYA.
Zelaya follows Castro, as te iittiucr.
The circmnstances are different, i>ut tho
cause is substantially the same. A*
Castro did In Venezuela, bo in Nica
ragua Zelaya has tyrannized the nation
lor selfish ends throughout ti protracted
dictatorship, and has involved the v.n
bappj country in difficulties vrith for
eign powers, until at last the long-sufler
ing people have revolted agninst him.
Ni>t only in the remote eastern prov
inces, but In the capita] province and
city, under the very walls <'f his palace,
the people have risen ajrainst a despot
v.ho enriched himself and despoiled the
nation. So. realizing: that his sordid
game is played out. he resigns the office
which he has disgraced.
He is like Castro, too. in the tonp of
his departinp utterance. It would be
difficult to imagine anything more de
void of real dignity or more illogical and
insincere than his message of resigna
tion. His references to the "painful cir
cumstances*' and the "oppression" of
the country ring hopelessly hollow when
they proceed from tlie very man who is
recognized by his own countrymen as
well as by the world at large as the
chief author of those conditions. It Is
self-srultifying to declare that the in
surgents are being defeated everywhere
and in the same Bentence to admit that
the country is "staggering under revolu
tion" and to add in the next sentence
that the President resigns in order to
induce the revolutionists to stop lighting
— those revolutionist* who have been
"everywhere defeated"! As for the com
plaint that the United States has un
justly intervened in Slcaraguan affairs,
it is both fnls<> and foolish.
Zelaya has shown hlmseif to belong
to the same class of dictators as Castro,
Carrera. Nunez and others, who are
stronj: enough to do evil but not strong
enough to do good. Barrios was an ar
bitrary dictator, but he had the ele
ments of a great statesman and did
much for the advantage of His country.
Rafael Reyes was dictatorial, but he i
to lie credited with almost inestimable
benefits to Colombia. Diaz has oft^n
been called a dictator, hut history re
cords few instances of greater good
being done for any country by a sincle
ruler than he has done for Mexico. But
men of the Zelaya type mingle no good
with their evil Their v;il>ir is that of
the marauder, their shrewdness that of
the cozener.

reasons. He was v prominent member
of Tluit class of journalists to which De

never wholly disappear, hut which has

It was the primarj' aim of Greenwood
and his preal contemporaries to record
history aud to commenl authoritatively
uiMHi it. It has become the feverish am
bition of many journalists of these later
days themselves to make the history
which iliev are to record, and to trive at
times more effort and attention to the
making than to i!i<' accurate and im
partial recordinp. Y<*t we are not sure
that any of the latter are to 1>»- credited
with greater achievements than are
those of a generation or tw< ago to
whom Tin- making of history was subor
dinate to their primary aim. Russell did
not po to the Crimea as a detective, or
an Investigator, or for the i mi rt »- ■ - of
putting tbe War < 'rti<-«> "in a hole." il^
went as a news reporter: but incident
aHj be did a work for administrative
reform second to no other on record in
British army annals. So Greenwood was
not a promoter or au aj-'fiit. In fi nance or
in diplomacy. He was a journalist, pure
and simple, and his suggestion to l»ls
raell for the purchase of the Khedive's
shares in the Suez <uuiil was th« result
not of elaborate jihu premeditated m
cattan, t>ut simply of his profeg
sional observations and the application
of his professional Judgment. The ln
spiration of that unsurpassed stroke of
public genius was simply an Incidental
offshoot of his real work as founder and
editor of a great newspaper.
Times have greatly changed since
Greenwood established "The Pall Mall
Gazette" — the journal of Thackeray's
ideal, "written l>y gentlemen for gentle
men." Such work as his. aud that -if

which it left was probably deeper and

A TOCIFEIiOUS PROCEEDIXG.
Tt would doubtless be rash to predict
that nothinp will come of the "war" of
union labor on the Steel Trust, but the
noisy way In which it was begun indl
eates little confidence on the part of Mr.
Gompers and his associates. When did
it become customary for the American
Federation of Labor to commence the
organization (if an industry with long
resolutions bolstered by wounding pre
ambles V Are net its habitual methods
more quiet and less public?
Moreover, the language of the resolu
tion suggests ■ desire to make up for
what force the movement itself la'-ks by
the force of the words employed. It has
a thunderous lilt. "Orown rich by the
"consent <>f the people of our country,
"this corporation, in its mad greed for
"still greater riches, sweeps aside, makes
"and unmakes law. Its enactors and ex
"ecntors, and is now engaged in an ef
"fort to destroy the only factor — the or
"gaolxatioa of its employes— standing
"between it and unlimited, unchecked
"and unbridled industrial, political, po
•vial and moral carnage." That sentence
leaves nothing to be desired. It is
Homeric in its defiant sweep. If the
wnr is to be one of words Mr. Gompers
has al! the heavy artillery in action.
Perhaps a sense of the strength of the
Steel Corporation's relations with its
employes inspires this eloquence. Nearly
20 per cent of the steel workers are
stockholders in the corporation, and
these workers are naturally among the
mosi permanent, industrious and capable
of its men. A strike would be against
their interests so long as they were
treated reasonably by the corporation,
and their influence with their feliow em
ployes can hardly fail to be greater than
that of the organizers whom Mr. Gom
pers summons with his bugle call.
THE GRATEFUL BOSS.
Politics has widened the circle of
Judge Gaynor's acquaintances. Two
months ago he was talking vaguely of
•'Mr. Charles F. Murphy, who Is said to
"be the leader of the locnl organization
"in Manhattan." But just as the cam
paitrn caused the Innocent candidate
from Flatbtuh to find out where Tam
many Hall was. bo it also brought him
the acquaintance of Murphy himself,
and he Is now doubtless one of the
judce's most valued correspondents.
The letter of tbe alleged leader of Man
hattan from Mount Clemens, Mich., to
the Mayor-elect — for the publication of
which the public is indebted to the
courtesy of Mr. Hearst — is a model let
ter from a boss to an officeholder In
It nothing but the velvet hand is re
vealed. From it no one would suppose
that the alleged leader was in the habit
of autocratic attention to details such
us N exhibited in the rest of the Mouni
Clemens correspondence— such, for ox
ample, as is revealed when Mr (Ohalan
writes to him to ler.rn his will about
filling » place on a "srorll commission"
in The Bronx.
On the contrary, the alleged leader
is moved profoundly b> n letter from
the St. .Tanivs statesman regretting his
absence from home when the leader
called. That portion of the English
language which has become a tractable
Instrument in his hands is hardly equal
to the burden of conveying his appre
ciation of this honor. "Your very kind
letter." he writes, "was forwarded to
me" — it is to be hoped thai tins "very
kind letter" and any others received
from the same source will be included
in Mr. Hearst's publication - and "I
was indeed pleased to bear from you."
And the alleged leader furthermore de
< biros it "certainly very gratifying' 1
tn know thai tli< i r.- "was such a
"hearty weh'ome for one at your most
"hospitable home.'' Many persons had
applied in the alleged leader, he writes,
m regard to jo!i> under the new admin
istration, but he liad advised them to
"make their applications direct" to the
coming Mayor. "When consulted" be
would gladly state whal he knew con
cerning them.

TO CELEBRATE EMAXCIPATIOX.
The question of making a national
celebration of tlie fiftieth anniversary of
the EimuKiimtion Proclamation in 1913
is twofold. One part, which is funda
mental and primary, Is whether there
should be auy such national celebration
ai all, and the other, which is secondary
and depeudeni upon tlie former, is what
tonn the celebration, if there is any,
shall take. The discussion at present
centres upon the suggestion of a na
tional or international exposition, to be
held at Savannah, for which undertak
ing, indeed, a request for an appropria
tion [5 now betore < longress.
Taking the second part of the ques
tion iirst. it must be confessed that
many persons think that expositions,
whether local, national or universal,
have been considerably overdone; that
they should ooi lie undertaken save at
much longer intervals than have oc
curred between them ba recent years,
and that some other method of com
memorating an anniversary or an epoch
is desirable; in suppori of which opin
ions there is doubtless much to be said.
< »i, the other hand, H is urged thai
nothing else can be devised which would
bo satisfiictorll] serve the purposes of
a great celebration as an exposition;
that SUcfa affairs are always sources of
entertainment und instruction to multi
tudes of people, and that the rupld
progress which the world Ih muklng in
the arts and sclencea assures the possi
bility of v profitable display of new
features at each Buch exi>Oßitiou. An
expoßltlon of the progreHs and achieve
ments of tbe negro race during these
lest fifty years and a comparison of its
condition in 18(i.'5 with that In 1913
would be of novel and exceptional in
terest aud of much practical prolit.
As for the other and more Important
part of the question, whether there
■hall be any national celebration at all,
there need not lie much hesitation In
answering it with an emphatic affirma
tive. The abolition of human slavery,
entirely apart from the attendant dr.
CUmStaitOßS aud the ways aud means
through which ji was achieved, m an
event of first clumh magnitude in the
history of America and of the world.
Its political, moral, social nod iad.ua
trial results wprp tremendous, affecting
not only this entire nation in even- pnit
but also In some perceptible degree every
other Important nation on the plobe.
Whatever may be thought of the wis
dom of some of Its sequels and Riipple
ments nnd of the way in which efforts
hnre been made to solve some of tho
colossal problems wuk-h it entailed
upon the nation, there can be no ques*.
tlon of its transcendent imi»ortance in
human annals.

It seems only a few years ago that
Cecil Rhodes's project of a Cape-to-
Oalro railroad was regarded us little
better than an "Iridescent dream." Now
we are tol<! that the southern British
part of the Stupendous work is com
pleted all the way from Cape Town to
the border of the Congo Free State
vherw that territory breaks the continu
ity of the British possessions. The dis
tance of this completed portion is 1.'. 147
miles. Now the Congolese authorities
are pushing work on their part of it.
and other work is being done in the
.Anglo- Egyptian Soudan, so that the next
two or three years may see through
trains run from Cairo, or rather from
Alexandria, to the Cape.

Apples from Canada are in greater de
mand In England than apples from the
United States, according to a consular
report published yesterday. Tiie only
reason given by the bu>er who g-oes to
Liverpool to make his purchases is tnat
when he takes a case or barrel of Ca
nadian apples he knows what he is get-
ting. When he takes American apples
there is usually more or less uncertainty
on that score. When Canadian apples
are packed for exportation they are care
fully sorted, and only one variety is put
into a barrel. Moreover, so much care is
exercised in grading that the contents of
a barrel are uniform. Less trouble is
taken with apples from the United
States. Occasionally, when a barrel is
opened half a dozen varieties will roll
out, and the apples near the middle will
be found hardly fit for cider. Many fruit
growers in Ontario are members of an
association, and send their apples to a
central packing place under Its manage
ment. After the fruit has been sorted,
graded and packed the association's label
is placed on the package, and is a guar
antee that if the contents are not what
they purport to he the buyer will be re
imbursed. Why cannot similar methods
be adopted in this country? The reputa
tion of a hundred honest packers suf

ferred to Is practised on an unknown
consumer.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR.
AS TO REALTY INFORMATION.
To th^ Editor of The Tribune
Bir: I wish to compliment you upon the
very thorough real estate news you ar*
publishing at the present time in your dally
paper. Tl.e uUßMplsUassa with which you
furnish owners' namci, assignment of mor'
gages and the description of property sold
at arctlon Is of great value to all the
people lntfrestPd hi rt-nl estate, and very
particularly to real estate brokers. I think
: he work yo 1 arp doing along these lines
will rta.t to jroor decided benefit.

THE UNEARNED INCREMENT.
To the Editor of Tlie Tribune.
Sir: In your Issue of to-day I see that
the Fourth Avenue Presbyterian Church, at
the corner of 22<J street and Fourth avenue,
has sold Its property. 114.2 by 100 feet, to
Mills & Glbb. to lif used for commercial
purposes; price. JfICO.OOO. '
As the # church bought the property In
April, 1553, for $43.0C0, the unearned incre
ment seems to be a large cne. and the
question arises why should not a part of
this unearned wealth po into the .city's
treasury. Is It not wealth that belongs to
all. because rrnatml by social causes?
It was in 1851, I think, that the Brick
Church, now at ITth street and Fifth ave
nue, when it sold Its property In the lower
part of the city, was obliged, after a friend
ly suit, to pay over to the city $58,000 as its
share of that Increase In value on the
property imputed to social causes. The
church, too, beitifc a religious body, had
benefited for years, as has the Fourth
Avenue Presbyterian Church, by being free
from certain taxes altogether.
Surely nothing: else known creates wealth
in land so raDidly as a modern city. Like
the three hundred German cities, why
should not New York so legislate that it.
too, would gel Its just share of this vast
wealth which the communiiy itself has
created? I tl;lnk this yearly increase Is
515i.«1.972. Is it not bert to tax the eco
nomic surplus, the unearned wealth, rather
than the him i mil It ■ ami processm of the
industry of -.>ur people"
This point baa been well taker, by Eng
land's ablf <'hancel!or of the Exchequer,
and the contest over this proposition in the
budget is to be one of the most momentous
in England's history.

A GOOD INNOVATION.
To the Editor of Th«- Tribune.
Sir: 1 bei; leave to congratulate you for
the innovation in publishing assignments of
mortgages.
Since the recnr<s!np tax has been imposed
on mortgages the practice of takins? mort
gages by assignment, thereby ax'oiding the
tax on a new mortgage, is becoming more
and more thf custom, and your publishing
these items will enable the brokers and
borrower! to get in touch with all the
lenders.
I think your practice of giving promi
nence t<i the property rather than t<"> the
borrower is ;■ K"ort one, Frequently tbe
borrower is a dummy.
TITI-I-: INSURANCE DIRECTOR.
New \o-k. Do
NOT ESCORT OF MAE WOOD.
To the Editor of The Tribune.
Sir: A paragraph in this morning's issue
of The Tribune states that Charles B.
Hubbeil escorted Ms. Mac Wood from the
Tombs. As T happen to be the only lawyer.
Indeed, the only resident of the city bearing
the full name indicated, and as I have had
no connection with this case, It is apparent
that some other person than myself was
the escort of this unhappy woman.
I am Fure you will make the needful cor
rection.

PROGRESS OF ESPERANTO.
To the Editor of The Tribune
Sir: Your editorial paragraph relative to
ESsperanti »nd its Inventor would seem to
be the product of haste rather than of re
flection ami exact information. Esperanto
is anything but an "anew to replace the
English language with an artificial speech."
Its aim is rather to uphold than to menace
the Integrity of Engll and of every other
national language Including by all means
those tongues of thf» smaller nationalities
which are Ht present threatened with ex
tinction, to the serious loss of their citizens
and of the world. The object of the rapidly
growing Esperanto movement is to leave
all natloneJ languages In their fullest vigor
for exclusive domestic and national use.
and simpl] to provide a flexible, easily ac
quired, expressive neutral speech for inter
national use.
It is somewhat late m the <!a\ to question
the utility of such an Instrument for draw
ing ihe peoples <;f the world more closely
together in the bonds of a mutual (■■>inpre
hi nslun. Thi t Esperanto possesses the de
sired qua liti< of such a longue to an .\
tent almost incredible to those who hay*
not investigated It has been unequivocally
established by some thirty years of the
most rigid testing. Of course, it cannot be
effectively mastered without some luU>r.
but the drudgery i- reduced to the mini
mum by tl •■ marvellous simplification vi' its
grammar and the great lnternationality .if
the roots whicl form the basis of its vocab
ulary. As nearly as can be mathematically
determined, any person can learn Esperanto
thoroughly in about one-fifth the time
which it woulil tuk- the same person to
learn any other living language. Yet, by a
wond< ■ system of uniform adlna and
modifying affixes, it is provided that the
extreme simplicity of the language, far
from impairing Its power to express a wide
range of Ideas, actually enables the finest
gradations of thought to receive the most
exact expression. These are noi mere
claims, but proved tacts. The la.iKuug*
already possesses a larye and rapidly in
< reasfc . literature in prose ami poetry, In
cluding such difficult subjects for transla
