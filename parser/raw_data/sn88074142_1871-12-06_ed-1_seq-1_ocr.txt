FURTHERANCE OF AMERICAN INTKRE.-T-
IN JAPAN AND CHINA.
To trivc importance and to ndd to tho
efficiency of our diplomatic relations witli
japan nnu unina, nnd '.o further us in re
taining the good opinion of thoso people,
and to secure to tho United St ites its sharo
of the commerce destined to flow between
these nations and tho balance of tho com
mercial world, I earnestly recommend
that an appropriation bo inn'doto support
at leaiit four American youths in each of
these countries, to servo as n part of tho
omciai lumilies ot our ministers there.
Our representatives would not even then
bu placed tiiion an eotislltv
with tho representatives of Grcut
llritian and somo other powers. As now
situated, our representatives in Japan and
mina nave to depend lor interpreters and
translators upon tho native) of lhoo coun
tries, who know our languor imperfectly,
or procure for tho occasion tho services of
employes in foreign business lioufC3, or tho
interpreters to other furcigu ministers. 1
would nuo recommend liberal measures
for tho purpose of uiding tho American
lines of steamers now plying between San
Francisco nnd Japan and China, and tho
Australian line, which ure almost our only
romaining lines of ocean steamers, and of
increasing their service.
THE COREAN TROUIII.ES.
Prompted bv u desiro to put an eml to
tho barbarous treatment of our .binwrr.lt.
cd sailors on tho Coreun coant.I instructed
our minister at i'okin to endeavor to eon.
elude a convention with C'orea for secur
ing the saiety and humane treatment cf
such marincrr. Admiral llogers wus in
structed to accompany him with u suffi
cient force to protect him in caso of need.
A small surveying pnrty, tent out, on
reaching tho coast, was treaehcroukly at
tacked at a disadvantage. Amplu oppor
tunity was given for explanations and nn
apology for thu Insult, hut neither
came. A forco was thon landed,
nnd after an arduous march over
n ruggod anl difficult country, tho forts
from which tho outrages had been commit
tod were gallantly assaulted and destroyed.
Having thus punished the crimlnals.'and
having vindicated tho honor of tho flag,
tho oxpodition roturncd. Finding it im
practicable, under tho circtimstancos, to
conclude tho desired conventiou, I respect
fully rofer to tho correspondence relating
thoroto, herewith submitted, nndleavo tho
subject for such action as congress may seo

REDUCTION OF THE KBIIV.
The national debt has bece reduced to
tho extent of $U,0o7,12C80 during the
year, and by thu negotiation of national
bonds nt n lower rate of lnteret, tho in
terest of tho public debt has been so far
diminished that now the urn to be raised
for the interest account is nearly $17,000,
000 less than on the 1st of March, 180'J. It
was highly desirablo that this diminution
slii-uld take ploco both to strengthen tho
credit of tho country, and eonvinco its
citi.cn of their entire abiliU to meet evcrv
dollar of liability without bankrupting
them; but in view of tha accomplishment
of those detirablo ends, of the rapid de
velopment of tiic resources of the country,
its increasing ability to meet largo de
mands and thu nuiouut already paid, it is
not desirablo that tho present resource? of
tha country tliould ooritinuo to l. l...l1i.
order to continue this rapid payment. I
thcrcforo recommend a modiftcatiot: of
both tariff and internal tax laws.
AIIOLIHON OF INTERNAL TAXEC RECOM
MENDED. I recommend that nil taxes from inter
nal sources bo abolished except thoso on
f piritiious, qinous and malt liquors, tobacco
in its various forms, from stamps. In re
adjusting tho tariff I suggest that a care
ful citimatu be made of thu amount of sur
plus rcveuuo collected under tho present
laws after providing for tho current ex
penses of the government the inter
est account and a sinking fund, and that
this Hirplus bi reduced in such manner as
to afford tho greatest relief to tho greatest
number. There aro many articles not
produced at home, such as medicine and
compounded essences, from which very
little revenue is derived, but which enter
into general use, all such articles I recom
mend to bo placed on tho free list. If
such n further reduction provo advisable.
. ,1., .... .
i wouiu men recommend i lint u no mado
on thoso articles on which it can be dono
without disturbing homo production or re
ducing tho wages of American labor. I
havo not entered into figures, becauso to
do so would bo to repeat nil that is laid
before you in the report of thu secretary
of the treasury.
COLLECTORS OF CUSTOMS,
In tho present laws for collecting reve-
nuo you pay collectors of customs small
salaries but provide for shares in ul
seizures, which, nt the principal ports of
entry particularly, raiso tho compensation
of thcio officials to a large sum. It lias
always s.'Cinel to mo that this system
must at all times work perniciously. It
holds out nn inducement to dishonest men.
should such get possession of those offices,
to oo lax in their scrutiny of goods en
tered to enable them finally to make large
seizures. Your attention is respectfully
Invited to this subject.
HOLD FLUCTUATION!.
Tho continued fluctuations In tho va!ue
of gold as compared with national curron-
cy bus ii most damaging effect upon tho ln-
crcasu nnu uoveiopmcni oi tlie country, in
keeping up the prices of nil articles neces-
snry In evnry-day life, and fosters u spirit

ARMY MATTERS.
For tho operations of tho army in tlie
pnst year, the expense of maintaining it,
thu estimates for tho cniulng ynar, and for
continuing the sea coast and other Im
provements conducted under tho supervis
ion of thu war department, I refer you to
thu accompanying report of the sccrotary
of war.
1 call your attention to tho provisions of
tho net of congress, npprovod March Urd,
1809, which discontinues promotions in tho
stall corps of tho army until provided for
by law. I recommond tint tho number of
olllcors in each grado of tho staff corps bo
fixed, and that whorover tho number in
uny one grado fulls below the number so
fixed, that tho vacancy may bo filled by
promotion from tho grado below. I also
recommond that when thu otlico of chieftif
corps becomes vacant tho placo may bo
filled by selection from tho corps in which
tho vacancy exists.

beon adopted, and Is being oxtonded ns

stations. Uy this means wo havo been en
abled to occupy at once a larger extent of

cially tho approximate duties of tho navy
in time of pcaco without exceeding tbo

thorized by law.
During tho past year the navy has, fn
addition to its regular service, supplied tho
men and officers for tho vessels of tho coast
survuy. and has completed tho survoys, as
authorized by congress, of tho Isthmuses of
Daricn and Tohuantepcc, and, under au
thority, has sent an expedition, completely

at present to be expected that this depart

Tho suggestions of tiio Postmaster

tho consideration of tho plan for uniting
tho telegraph system of tho United States
with tho postal system. It is believed
that by such n course, tho cot of telegraph

would secure n further advantage by ex

KU-KLUX MATTERS.
There has been imposed upon thu exec
utive branch of tho government tho exe
cution of the net of congress approved
April 20th, 1871, und. commonly known
as the "ku-klux law." In u portion of
thu Stale of South Carolina the necessity
for tho course pursued will be demon
strated by tho report of tho committee to
investigate southern outrages. Under tho
provisions of thu nbovo act I issued u
proclamation, calling tho attention of thu
United States to the mine, und declaring
my reluctance to exercUo any of tliu ex
traordinary powers horcDy conferred up
on me, except in case of" imperative ne
cessity, but making known my purpose to
excrcuu such power whenever it should
becomo necessary to do so, for the purpose
of securing to all citizens of tlm United
States thu peaceful enjoyment of tho rights
guaranteed to them by thu cotixtitution
and tho laws.
After tho passage of this law Informa
tion was received from timu to lime that
a combination of tho chiiracter loferred to
In this lav existed and woro powerful in
many parts of tho southern states,
particularly in certain counties in
tho Stato of' South Carolina. Careful in
vestigation was made, and it was ascer
tained that In nino counties of tlnit stto
such combinations were active and power
ful, onibrucing a sufficient portion of tho
citizens to control the local authority, and
having, among otlior things, the object of
depriving the emancipated class of tho
substantial benefits of freedom, and of
preventing tho free political ucti.ii of thoso
citizens who did not syii.pjtizo with their
own views. Among their operation wero
frequent scourging and occasional assas
sination?, generally perpetrated at night
by disguised person, tho victims In al
most all cases being citizen of different
political sentiments from tlieir own, or
porsons who had shown a disposition to
claim equal rights with otlior citizen'.
Thousands of inoffensive and well dis
posed citlzons wero tho sufferers by this
lawless violence, whereupon, on thu 13th
of October, 1871, a proclamation was is
sued in tho terms of tho law, calling upon
tho members nf tho combination to dis
perse within live days, and todulivir to
tho marshal or military officers of tho
United States nil nrmi, ammunition, uni
forms, disguise, nnd otlior moans and im
plements used by them for carrying out
tlioir unlawful purposes, This warn
ing not hnving been heeded, on
tho 17th of Octobur another proclamation

POLITICAL DISARILITIES.
More than. six yoars havo elapsed slnco
tho last hostllo gun was tired between tho
armies ithen arrayed against each other,
ono for tho porpotuatlon, the other for tho
destruction of tho union, it may well bo
considered whether it is not now tlmo
that tho disabilities imposed by tho four
teenth amendment should bo romoved.
That amendment does not excludo tho
ballot, but only requires tho disability to
hold offleo of certain classes. "Whon tho
purity of the ballot Is secured, msjoritos
aro sitro to oloct officers lellocting tho
views of tho majority. I do not seo tho
ndvuntagoor proprloty of excluding nun
from office merely who woro before tho re
bellion of standing and character sufficient
to bo elected to positions, requiring them
to Uko oath to support tho constitution,
nnd admitting to eligibility those cnter
tulnlng precisely tho same views, but of
lessstandini' In tholr community.
i may oo saiu mo lormor violated an
oath whilo tho latter did not. The latter
did not havo it In their power to do so. If
they had taken this oath it cannot bo
doubted they would havo broken it as did
the ferinsr class. It thcro aro any great
criminals, distinguished abovo nil others
for tho part they took in opposition to tho
government, they might, in tho judgment
of congress, bo cxcludod from such an
amnesty. This subject is submitted for
your careful consideration.

TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT.
Under the provisions of tho act of con
gress approved February 21, 1871, a terri
torial government was organized in the
District of Columbia. Its results havo
thus far fully realized tho expectations of
its advocates. Under tho diroction of tho
tcritorial officers, n system of improve
ments lias been inaugurated, bv means of
which "Washincton is ranidlv necnmW n

1MMIURAHON LAWS.
During this fiscal year tho number of
immigrants ignorant of our laws and hab
its, und coming into our country annually,
has becomo so great, and thu impositions
practiced upon them so numerous and
llagrant, that I suggest congressional action
for tlioir protection. It seems to mo a fair
subject of legislation by congress. 1 can
not now stato as fully as 1 desiro tho nature
of tho complaints by immigrants of tho
treatment they receive, but will endeavor
to do so during tho session of eongres,
particularly if tho subject should receive
your attention.
PUJII.IC OEFICEKS.
It has beentheaim nf tho administration
to enforco honesty nnd efficiency In nil
public offices. Every public servant who
lias violated tho trust placed I.i him has
been proceeded against with all thu vigor
of thn law. If bad men havo so
curcd places it has bion tho fault
of tho system established by luw nnd cus
tom for mnklng appointments, or tho
fault of thoso who recommended for gov
ernment positions poroons not sufficiently
well-known to them personally, or who
givo letters endorsing tho character of
office-seekers without a proper sensu of tho
grave responsibility which such it coursu
devolves upon thorn.
A civil ervlce reform which can correct
this ubuso is much desired. In mercan
tile pursuit, tiio business man who gives
u letter of recommendation to a friend to
onnblu him to get crodlt from i strungur, is
regarded us morally responsible for tho in
tegrity of ills friend nnd his ability to
meet III obligation. A reformatory law
which would enforcu this principle against
all indoMois of persons for public "placo
would Insure great caution in making rec
ommendations. A salutary lesson has
been taught tho curuless mid tho dishonest
servant in the great number of prosecu
tions nnd convictions of tho Inst two
year.
His gratifying to notice the fuvorablu
chaugo which is taking placo throughout
thu country in bringing to punishment
thoso who havo proved recreant to the
trusts confided to them, nnd inelovntingto
oflleu none but thoso who possess tho confl
donco of tho honest nnd virtuous who, it
will always bj found, comprlso thu ma
jority of thu community in which tboy
live.
In my mosingu to congruss ono year
ago 1 urgently recommended n reform in
tho
CIVIL SERVICE
of tho country. In comformity
with that recommendation congress,
in tho ninth section of nn act mak
ing appropriation forsundry civil expenses
of tho government and for otlior pur
posos, approvod March 'J, 1871, gavo tho
necessary authority to tho Kxocutivo to
iiiaugunito civil service reform, and placed
upon him the rcsiioiidbility of doing so.
Under tho authority of said law I con
vened a board of gentlemen eminently
qualified for tho work to duvlso
rules und regulations to effect needed
reform, Tholr labors nro not yot com
pleted, but it is believed that they will
succocd iu dovMn.j a plan which can bo

Information, to bu members ol such un
lawful combinations should bo arrested bv
tho military forces of tho United States,
and delivered to tho marshal, to bo dealt

counties. York and Spartansburg, many

Theso have generally mndo confessions of
their guilt.
Great caution hns been oxcrclsod In
making lest nrrosts, nnd notwithstanding
tho largo number, it is believed that no
innocent porson is now in custody. Tho
prisoners will bo held for regular trial in
July, at tho tribunals cf tho United
States.
As soon as itappenrcd that tho authori
ties of tho United States woro about to
tako vigorous measures to enforco tho law,
many persons nbsconded, nnd thcro Is good
grounds for supposing that nil such per
son! hnvo violated tho'law.
A full report of what has been dono un
der thw laW Wlll bo submitted to congress
by tho attorncy-genoral.
THE MORMON qUESTION.
In Utah thcro still remains n remnant
of barbarism repugnant to civilization and
decency nnd to tho laws of tho United
States. Territorial officers, however, havo
been found who aro willing to perform
tholr d.ity in n spirit of equity, and with a
duo sensu of sustaining tho majesty of tho
law.
Neither polygamy nor nny other viola
tion of existing statutes will bo permitted
within the territory of thu United Stntes.
It is not with tho religion of tho solf-stylcd
saints that wo aro now denllng, but their
practices. Thoy will bo protected In their
worship of Hod, nccordlng to tho
dictates of their consciences,
but they will not bo nor-
mlttcd to violate tho laws under tho cloak
of religion. It muy bo advisable for con
gress to consider what fn tho execution
of the laws against polygamy Is to bo tho
status of plural wives and tlieir offspring.
Tho propriety of congress passing an en
abling act authorizing tho territorial leg
islature of Utah to legitimatize nil born
prior to a tlmo fixed in thn act, might bo
justified by its humnnltv to theso innocent
children. This is u suggestion only and
not n recommendation.
INDIAN POLICY.
Tho policy pursued toward tho Indians
has resulted favorably, so far as can bo
judged from tho limited tlmo during which
It has been in operation. Through tho
exertions of tho various societies of Chris
tians to whom lias been entrusted tho exe
cution of tho policy, and tho board of cen
sus, authorized by tho law of April 10th,
18011, many tribes havo been induced to
ettlo on reservations, to cultivate, tho soil,
and perform productive labor of various
kinds, and to partially accept civilization.
They nro buing cared for in such u way,
it is Imped, us to induco thoso still pursu
ing tlieir old habits of lite to embrace tho
only opportunity which is left them to
avoid oxtuiminuiion. I recommend lib
eral appropriations to curry out tho In
dian peace policy not only becuuso it is
humane, chrWtianllkc nnd economical, but
becauso His right.
I recommend to your favorable con
sideration Atin tho JX'llt'J- f f-ft-.
territorial government to tiio Indians of
tho Indian territory west of Arkansas and
Missouri and south of Kansas. In
doing so every right guaranteed to them
should bo secured. Such a cutirso might
bo thu means of collecting most of tho
Indians now between tho Missouri and tha
Pacific, and south of tho Uritish possess
ions Into ono territory or ono state. The
secretary of tho interior has treated upon
this subject at length. And I recommend
to you his suggestions. I renew my rec
ommendation that the
PUHI.IC LANDS
bo rcgorded ns n hcritngo to our children,
to bo disposed of only us required for oc
cupation und to actual settlers. Thoso ul
rendy grunted hnvo been in gncnt dis
posed of in such a way into secure ac
cess to thu balanco by tho hardy settler
who may wish to avail himsolf of them,
out caution should ho exercised in attain
ing so desirablo an object. Educational
Interest may well bo served by tho grunt
of proceeds of tho salo of public hinds to
settlers. I do not wish to bo understood
as recommending in tho least degree n
curtailment of what is being dono Liy tho
genorul government for tho encourage
ment of education.
Tho re.ort of tbo secretary of tho inter
ior, submitted with this, will give you

Tho report of thu Commissioner of Ag
