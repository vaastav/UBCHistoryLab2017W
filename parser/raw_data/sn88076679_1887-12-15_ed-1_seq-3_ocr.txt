of the Surplus Urgently Urged.

the current fiscal year. Notwithstanding
these operatiops of the treasury department,
representations of distress in business cir

THE PBK8ENT BONDED DEBT
might be refunded at a less rate of interest
ana the difference between the.old and new
security paid in cash, thus finding use for
the surplus in the treasury. The euecesn of
this plan, it is apparent, must depend upon
the volition of the holders of the present
bonds and it is not entirely certain that the
inducement which must be offered them
would result in more financial benefit to the
government than the purchase of bonds,
while the latter proposition would reduce
the principal of the debt b^actual payment
instead of extending it le proposition to
deposit the money held by the government
in banks throughout the country for use by
the people is, it seems to me, exceedingly
objectionable in principle, as establishing
too close a relationship between tho opera
tions of the government treasury and the
business of the country, and too extensive a
commingling of their money, thus fostering
an unnatural reliance in private business
upon public funda If this scheme should
be adopted it should only be'done as a tem
porary expedient to meet an urgent neces
sity. Legislative and executive effort should
generally be in the opposite direction and
should have a tendency to divorce, as much
and as
fast as can safely be done, the treas
ury department from private enterprise.
Of course it is not expected that unnecessary
and extravagant appropriations will be made
for the purpose of avoiding the accumulation
of an excess of revenue. Such expenditure,
beside the demoralization of all just con
ceptions of publio duty which it entails,
stimulates a habit of reckless improvidence
not in the least consistent with the mission of
our people or the high and beneficent pur
poses of our government I have deemed it
my duty to thus bring to the knowledge of
my countrvmen, as well as to the attention
of their representatives charged with the re
sponsibilities of legislative relief, the gravity
of our financial situation. The failure of con
gress heretofore to provide against the in
gers which it was quite evident the very na
ture of the difficulty must necessarily pro
duce, caused a condition of financial distress
and apprehension since ypur lust aojourn
ment which taxed to the utmost till the au
thority and expedients within executive con
trol and these appear now to be exhausted.
If disaster results from the continued inac
tion of congress, the responsibility must rest
where it belonga '1 hough the situation thus
far considered is fraught with danger which
should be fully realized, and though it pre
sents features of wrong to the people as well
as
PBBIL 10 THS COUN1BT,
it is but a result growing out of a per
fectly palpable and apparent Cause, con
stantly reproducing the samo alarming cir
cumstances—a congested national treasury
and a depleted monetary condition in the
business of the country. It need hardly be
Btated that while the present situation de
mands a remedy, we can only be saved from
a like predicament in the future by the re
moval of its cause. Our scheme of taxation,
by means of which this needless surplus is
taken from the people and put into the pub
lic treasury, consists of a tariff or duty levied
upon importations from abroad and internal
revenue taxes levied upon the consumption
of tobacco and spirituous and malt Jiqnors.
It must be conceded that none
ot
IMPOSE A BURDEN
upOn those wbo consume domestic products
as well as those who consume Imported
articles, and thus fteate a tax upon all our
people. It is not proposed to entirely re
lieve the country of this taxation. It must
be fexten&ively continued as the source of
the government's income and in a readiust
ment of our tariff the interests of American
labor engaged in manufacture shotild be
carefully considered, as well as the preserva
tion of our manufacturers. It may be called
protection, or by any other name, but relief
from the hardships and dangers of our pres
ent tariff laws shonld be devised with espe
cial precaution against imperiling the exist
ence of our manufacturing interests. But
this existence should not mean a condition
which, wijtbout regard to the publio welfare
or a national exigency, must always insure
the realization of immense profits Instead of
moderately profitable returns. As the vol
ume and diversity of our national activities
increase, new recruits are added to those
who" desire a continuation of the advantages
which they conceive the present system of
tariff tax&tion directly affords them. So
stubbornly have all efforts to reform the
present oonditlon been resisted by those of
our fellow citizens thus engaged, that they
can hardly complain of the suspicion, enter
tained to a certain extent, that there exists
an organized combination all along the
line to maintain their advantage. We are in
the midst of centennial celebrations, and
wiUi becoming pride we rejoice in American
skill and ingenuity, in American energy
and enterprise, and in the wonderful
natural advantages and resources developed
by a century's national growth. Yet when
an attempt is made to justify a Rchcme
which permits a tax to be laid upon every
consumer in the land for the benefit of our
manufacturers, quite beyond a reasonable
demand for governmental regard, it Buits
the purposes of advocacy to call our manu
factures-infant industries, still needing the
highest and greatest degree of favor and
fostering care that can be wrung from
federal legislation. It is aleo said that the
increase in the price of domestic manufact
ure resulting from the present tariff is nec
essary in order that higher wages may be
paid to our workingmen employed in manu
factories, than are paid for what is called
the pauper labor of Europe. All will ac
knowledge the force of an argument which
involves the welfare and liberal compensa
tion of our laboring people. Our labor is
honorable in the eyes of every American
Citizen. As it lays the foundation of our
development and progress, it is entitled,
without affectation or hypocrisy, to the
utmost regard. The standard of our labor
er's life should not be measured by that of
any other country iefs favored, and
they are entitled to their full phare
of all our advantages.. v&By the last
census it Is made to abniar that of the
17,372.099 of tfur popufffHjMrong&ged inall
kinds of industries, 7.670.493 are employed
in agriculture, 4,074,23$ in professional

are domestic servants and laborers), while
1,810,256 are employed in trade and trans
portation, and 3.837,112 are classed as em
ployed in manufacturing and mining.

For present purposes, however, the last

To these the appeal is made to save their

smlnam&oriQr among

filoyment
the things
subjected to internal revenue taxatiou are,
strictly speaking, necessary. There appears
to be no just complaint of this taxation by
the consumers of these articles, and bere
seems to be nothing so well able to bear the
burden without hardship to any portion of
the people. But our present tariff laws, the
vicious, inequitable, and illogical source of
unnecessary taxation, ousrht to be at once
revised and ameuded- These laws, as their
primary and plain effect, raise the price to
consumers of all articles imported and subr
ject t6 duty, by precisely the sum paid lor
such duties. Thus the amount of the duty
measures the tax paid by those who purchase
for use these imported articles. Many of
these things, however, areraised or iuu
factured in our country, and tht« duties now
levied upon foreign goods and products are
called production to these home manufact
ures, because they render it possible for
those of our people who are manufacturers
to make these taxed articles and sell them
for a price equal to that demanded for the
imported goods that have paid oustoms duty.
Bo it happens that while comparatively a few
use the imported articles, millions of our
people, who never use and never saw itny of
the'imported products, purchase and use
things of the same kind made in this oountr.v
and pay therefor nearly or quite the same
charged price which the duty adds to the
imported articles. Those who buy imports
pay the duty charged thereon into the pub
lic treasury, but the great, majority of our
citizens who buy domestic articles of the
same class pay a sum at least approximately
equal to this duty to the home manufact
urer. Tliis reference to the operation of our
tariff laws is not made by way of instruc
tion, but in order that we may be constantly
remindedjof the manner in which they

those who labor, and therefore shonld fore
go an advantage, in tbe interest of low
prloes for the majority: their compensation,
as may be ab'ected by the operation of tariff
laws, should at all times be kept scrupul
ously in view and yet. with slight reflec
tion they will not overlook the fact that they
are consumers with the rest that they, toe,
have their own wants and those of their
families to supply from their earnings, and
that the price of the necessaries of life, as
well as the amount of their wages,will regu
late tbe measure of their welfare and com
fort. But the reduction of taxatiou de
manded should be so. measured as not to
necessitate or justify either the loss of em-
by the worklngman northe lessen-
ngof his wages and the profits Btill re
maining to the manufacturer, after a neces
sary readjustment, should furnish no excuse
for the sacrifice of the interests of his em
ployes, either in their opportunity to work
or in the diminution of their compensation.
Nor can the worker in manufactures fail to
understand that while a high tariff is claimed
to be necessary to allow the payment
of remunerative wages, it certainly results
in a very large increase in the price of nearly
all sorts of manufactures, whicb, in almost
countless forms, he needs for tbe use of him
self and bis family. He receives at the desk
of his employer liis wages, and perhaps be
fore he reaches his home is obliged, in a
purchase lor family use of an article which
embraces his own labor, to return in the
payment of tho increase in price which the
tariff permits the hard-earned compensation
of many days of toiL
WOOI*
Hie itemoval or Reduction of Duties Tliere
on Suggested, Supported by Exhaustive
Argument.
The farmer or agriculturist who manu
factures nothing but who pays the increased
price which the tariff imposes upon eveiy,
agricultural implement, upon all he weais
and upon all be uses and owns, except the
increase of his flocks and rds and such
things as his husbandry produces from the
soli, is invited to aid in ma utaining the
present situation and he is told that a high
duty on imported wool is nee ssary for those
wbo have sheep to shear, i order that tbe
price of their wool may b. ncreased They,
of course, are not remin i that the farmer
twho
has no sheep is by ti scheme obliged,
in his purchased of clowning and woolen
goods, to pay a tribute to his fellow farmer
as well as to the manufacturer and mer
chant nor is any mention made of the fact
that the sheep owners themselves and their
households must wear clothing and
use other articles manufactured from the
wool they sell at tariff prices, and thus
as consumers must return their shares
of this increased price of*the tradesman. I
think It may be fairly assumed that a large
proportion of the sheep ownsd by the farm
ers throughout the country are found in
small flocks numbering from tw.enty-five to
fifty. The duty on the grade of imported
wool whicb these sheep yield is ten cents
each pound if of the value of thirty cent3 or
less, and twelve cents if of the value of more
than thirty cents. If the liberal es'imate of
Bix pounds be allowed for each fleece", the
duty thereon would be sixty or seventy-two
cents, and this may be tuken as the utmost
enhancement of its price to the farmer by
reason of this duty. Eighteen dollars would
thus represent the increased price of the
wool from twenty-live sheep and $30 that
from the wool of fifty sheep, and ai prpsent
values this addition would amount to about
one-third of its price. If upon its sale the
farmer receives this or a less tariff profit, the
wool leaves his hands charged with precisely
that sum, which in all Its changes will ad
here to it until it reaches the consumer.
When manufactured into cloth and other
goods and mateiial for use, its cost is not
only increased to the extent of the
farmer's tariff profit, but a further
sum has been added for tbe profit
of the manufacturer under tbe operation of
thejro tariff laws. In the meantime the day
arrlyes when the farmer fiuds it necessary
to purchase woolen goods and material to
clothe himself and family for tbe winter.
When he faces the tradesman for that pur
pose be discovers that he is obliged not only
to return, in the way of increased prices, his
tariff profit on the wool bs sold, and which
then perhaps lies before him in manufact
ured form, but that he must add a consider
able sum thereto to meet a further increase
in cost caused by a tariff duty on tho manu
facture. Thus in the end he is aroused to
the fact that he has paid upon a moderate
purchase as a result of the tariff scheme,
which, when he sold bis wool, seemed so
profitable,
AN IKfcBEASfi IN PBICE
more than sufficient to sweep away all the
tariff profit he received upon the wool he
produced and sold. When the number of
farmers engaged in wool raising is compared
with all the farmers in the country, and the
small proportion ihey bear to our popula
tion is considered when it is mado apparent
tnat, in the case of a large part of those wbo
own Bheep, the benefit of the present tariff
on wool is iliusory, and, above all, when it
must, be conceded that the increase of
the cost of living caused by such
tariff becomes a burden upon those
with moderate means and the poor, the
employed ana unemployed, the sick and
well, pnd the young and old, and that it con
stitutes a tax which, with relentless grasp,
is fastened upon the clothing of every man,
woman and child in the land, reasons are
suggested why the removal or reduction of
this duty should be included in a revision of
our tariil laws. In speaking of the increased
cost-to the consumer of our home manufact
ures, resulting from a duty laid upon im
ported articles of the same description, the
fact ia not overlooked that competition
among our domestic "producers sometimes
has the feffect of keeping the price of their
products below the highest limit allowed by
such duty. But it is notorious that this com
petition is too often strangled by combina
tions quite prevalent at this time, and fre
quently called trusts, which have for their
object the regulation of the supply and price
of commodities made and sold by members
of tbe combination. The people can barely
hope for any consideration in the operation
of these selfish schemes. If, however, in
the absence of such combinations, a healthy
and free competition reduces the price of
any particular dutiable article of hoifte pro
duction, below the limit which it might oth
erwise reach 'under our tariff laws, and if,
with such reduced price, its manufacture
continue to thrive, it is entirely evident
that one thing has been discovered which
should be carefully scrutinized in an effort
to reduce taxation. The necessity of com
bination to maintain the price of any com
modity to the tariff point furnishes proof
that some one is willing to accept lower
prices for suoh commodity, and that such
prices are remunerative and lower prices
produced by competition prove the same
thing. Thus where ^either of these condi
tions exist a case would seem to be pre
sented for an easy reduction of taxation. The
considerations which have been presented
touching our tariff laws are intended only to
enforce an earnest recommendation that the
surplus revenue of the government bo pre
vented by the
BKDUCTION OF OUB CUSTOMS DUTIES.
and, at the same time, to emphasize a sug
gestion that in accomplishing this purpose
we may discharge a double duty to our peo
ple by granting to them a measure of relief
from tariff taxation in quarters where it is
mast needed and from sources where it can
be most fairly and justly accorded. Nor can
the presentation made of such consider
ations be, with any degree of fairness, re
garded as evidence-of unfriendliness toward
our manufacturing Interests, or of any lack
of appreciation of their value and im
portance. These interests constitute a lead
ing and most substantial element of our na
tional greatness and furnish the proud proof
of our country's progress. But if in the
emergency that presses upon us our manu
facturers are are asked to surrender some
thing for the publio good and to avert dis
aster, their patriotism, as well as a grateful
rectsnition of advantages already afforded,
should lead them to willing co-operation.
No demand is made that they shall forego all
the benefits of the governmental regard:
but they cannot fall to be admonished of
their duty, as well as their enlightened self
interest and safety, when they are reminded
of the fact that financial panic and collapse,
to which the present condition tends, afford
no greater
shelter or protection to our manu
facturers than our other important enter
prises. Opportunity for safe,-careful, and
deliberate reform is now offered and none
of us should be,nnmlndful of ft time when
.an abused and irritated people, heedless
ot
those who have resisted timely and reason
able relief, may insist upon a radical and
sweeping' rectification of their wrongs.
The difficulty attending a wise aSftl
fait revision of oar tariff laws fa
not tinder estimated. It will re
quire on the part of the
'eongress great labor
spd care, and especially a broad ana national
contemplation of the subject, and »patriotic
disregard of audi local and selfish claims as
are unreasonable andjregaqUess of the wel
ters of the entire oountry. Under our pres
ent laws more taan four thousand articles
A-
are subject to duty. Many of
in any way compare with our

these do not
own manu­
factures, and many are hardly worth atten
tion as subjects of revenue. A considerable
reduction can be made in the aggregate by
ADDING THEM TO THE FREE LIST.
The taxation of luxuries presents no feat
ures of hardship but the necessaries of life
used and consumed by all people, tbe duty
upon which adds to the cost of living in
every home, should be greatly cbeaj.oned.
The radical reduction of the duties imposed
unon raw material used in manufactures, or
its free importation, is, of course, an im
portant factor in any effort to reduce the
price of these necessaries it would not only
relieve them from the increased cost caused
by the tariff on such material, but the man
ufactured product being thus cheapened that
part of the tariff now laid upon Buch product
as compensation to our manufactun-rs for
tbe present price of raw material could
be accordingly modified. Such reduc
tion, or free importation,' would serve
beside to largely reduce tbe le venue It is
not apparent how such a change can have
any injurious effect upon our manufacturers.
On the contrary it would appear to give them
a better chance in foreign markets with th?
manufacturers of other countries, who
cheapen their ware with free material. Thus
our people might have the opportunity of
extending their sales beyond home con
sumption. saving them from the deTjre^sfon.
Interruption in business, and loss caused by
glutted domestic market, and affording their
employes more certain and steady labor,
with its resulting quiet and contentment
The question thus imperatively^prt-sented
for solution should be approached in a
spirit higher than partisanship, and consid
ered in the light of that regard for patriotic
duty which shotild characterize the action
of those intrusted with the we il of a confid
ing people. But tbe obligation to declared
party policy and principle is not wanting to
urge prompt and effective action. Both of
the great polit:cal parties now represented
in tne government lir. ve, by repeated an1
authoritative declarations, condemned
the condition of laws which- permit
the collection from the people of .un
necessary revenue, and have, in the most
sol'-mn manner promised its correction and
neither a* ctizens nor partif-ans are out
countrymen in a mood to condone the de
liberate violation of tbe* e pledges. /Our
progress toward a wise conclusion will not
be improved by dwelling upon the theories
of protection and free trade. This savors
too much of bandying epithets. It is a con
dition which confronts us, not a theory.
Belief from this condition may iuvolve a
slight reduction of the advantages which we
award our home productions, bu'. tbe entire
withdrawal of such advantages should no:
be contemplated.
THE QUESTION OF FBEE TRADK
is absolutely irrelevant, and the persistent
claim made in ccroain quarteri that all
efforts to save the people from unjust and
u inecessary taxation are schemes of so
called free traders, is mischievous and far
removed from any consideration for tbe
public good. The simple and plain duty
which we owe the people is to reduce taxa
tion to the necessary expense of an econom
ical operation of the government, and to re
store to the business of the country the
money which we hold in the treasury
through the petverslon of governmental
powers. These things can and should be
done with safety to all our industries, with
our, dancer to the opportunity lor remun
erative labor which our workingmen need
and with benefit to them and all our people,
by cheapening their means of subsistence
and increasing the measure of their com
forts. The constitution providei that th^
president "shall, from time to time, give to
the congress information of tho state*of the
Union." It has been the custom of the ex
ecutive, in compliance with th s provision,
to annually exhibit to the congress, at the
opening of its session, the general condition
of the country, and to detail, with s.ime par
ticularity, the operations of the different
executive departments. It would be espec
ially agreeable to follow this course at the
present time, and to call attention to the
valuable accomplishments of these depart
ments during the lust fiscal year. But I am
so much impressed with tbe paramount im
portance of the subject to wnich this com
munication has 4hus far been de
voted, that I shall forego the
addition of any other topic, and
only urge upon your immediate considera
tion the "Btate of the Union," as 6fcown in
the present condition of .our treasury tmd
our general fiscal condition, upon which
every element of ourSafety and prosperity
depends. The reports of the heads of depart
ments, which will be submitted, contain full
and explicit information touching the trans
actions of the i.usiness intrusted to them,
and such recommendation* relating to legis
iatjon in the public interest as they deem
advisable. I ask for these reports and rec
ommendations the deliberate examination
and action of the legislative branch of the
government There are other subjec.s not
embraced in the departmental reporto de
manding legislative consideration and whicb
I should be glad to submit Some of them,
however, have been earnestly piesented in
previous messages, and as to them, I beg
leave to repeat prior recommendations. As
the law inaltes no provision for any report
from the department, of state, a brief history
of the transactions of that important depart
ment, together with other matters which it
may hereafter bo deemed essential to com
mend to the attention of the congress, may
furnish tho occasion for a future commuui

Don't tio with the Protectionist it?
Washington, Special Telegram, Deo. 6.—
The president's message fell a little flat in
tho house to-day, althpugh making the tariff
its main point of discussion and leaving out
all other matters. It furnished no new
points and made no suggestions to congress
that would be followed. 8traddling and
vacillating between protection and free
trade, it pleased no one completely. After
having a half-dozen experts at work during
the past three months
collecting figures from
the latest sources, he supplies congress with
stale extrpatc^ from the census of 1880.
Throughout it is a reply to a protectiou
stump speech. It does not in any paragraph
rise above party. Members on the Demo
ratio Bide of the house, while openly prais
ing the message, were inclined to find fault
becausono plan of action was suggested.
The Republicans criiioised the message
freely. Said a Virginia Republican:
That man has ignored our interests entirely.
With that document in the land in the lost cam
paign. we could have carried the state without
trouble.
Congressman Orosvenor of Ohio said:
I think our wool men will believe me now. I
told them a cood while ago: "You have been
fouling with this wool tariff business for some
time. You have been trying to control It iu
Ohio by electing a Republican bero and a Demo
crat there without' result." They got a black
eye in this me.-sage that I think will teach them
to go to the Republican party hereafter for re
lief.
Congressman Nelson said to-day:
I rather think tho president's message was a
Sis
retty good document. It seemed to me that
recommendations were fair to us. Of conrse
there are a good many recommendations of his
that I do not like, but I think he has treated the
tariff fairly.
Mr. Llnd was inclined to agree with Itfr.
Nelson. Congressman McDonald says:
I think the recommendations of the president
a good argument in favor of the revision of tbe
tariff. The subject was fully covered, clearly
analyzed, and ttie duty of congress fully im
pressed upon it. I am very well pleased with
the terseness and completeness of tbe docu
ment.
Congressman Xelley—To execute" the objeots
indicated by tbe president without destroying
many of the leading industries of the oountry
is an utter impossibility. It is said that Mr.
Cleveland pnbllcly admitted that he bad not
known bow large tbe oountry
.jvas until he took
bis party trip around the circle which had not
anything like the diameter of that around which
Andy Johnson swung Mr. Seward. The reading
ot the message will convince the mfen wbose
capital, skill or industry are embarked ia our
productive pursuits that he knews less or the
natural resources of the country and the capacity
of its people than he did of the almost boundless
limits ot its territory when be started on bis
summer Jaunt.
Mr. Randall—Well, he forces the Issue upon us.
Mr. Bingham of Pennsylvania—It Is tbe most
full and explicit utterance in the direction of
freetrsde during his administration. It goes
farther than any Democratic utterance in this
bouse ln any debates on tbe tariff question, and
it certainly wi bt of great benefit to tbe Be
puelican party to the issue so well defined.
William Walter Phelps—Be comes ont sqoareljr
against protection to American labor, so that
every man can sse Just where he Is, sad on that
ibsue we can carry the oountrr.
Mr. Reed—It has oome like a great blessing
to us. Now we see what is in our fronfc
Senator Frye—It is exactly the message we
wanted. It sharply defines tSs issoe, and leaves
tbe BepoUleaas nothing te be desired.

A Square Statement by a Carpenter.
"For years I ha\'e had a chest trouble
amounting to nothing short of consump
tion. I saw how others in like condition
had been cured by the use of I)r. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery, and resolved to
test its merits in my own case. The re
suits are so plane as hardly to require a
bitstock or any auger-ment in favor of
this great ramedy. It does awl it claims!
It builds up the system, supports and
strengthens where others fail." He adz:
"My ^recovery, which is now on a sure
foundsition, hinges entirely on the compass
of'this wonderful Restorative, having tried
other remedies without a bit of relief."

The Experience of Mrs. Peters.
Mrs. Peters had ills,
Mrs. Peters had chills,
Mrs. Peters was sure she was going to
die
They dosed her with pills,
With powders and squills,
With remedies wet, and with remedies
dry.
Many medicines lured her,
But none of them cured her,
Their nnmes and their number nobody
could tell
And she soon might have died,
But some "pellets" were tried,
I'hat acted like magic, and then she
got well.
The magic "pellets" were Dr. Pierce's
Pleasant Purgative Pellets (the original.
Little Liver Pills). They cuied Mrs. Pe
ters, and now Bhe wouldn't be without
them.
