CHAPTER XV.
The Face That Looked Into Joan's.
Tho chamber to which tho Duchess
Joan wns conducted by her hostess
had evidently been carefully prepar
ed for her reception. It was a Inrge,
low room, with a vaulted roof of carv
en wood. Tho work was of great
merit nnd evidently old. A tnblo with
a llttlo prle-Dleu stood in tho corner,
screened by a curtain which ran on
a brazen rod. A ltoman Hrovlary lay
on n velvet-covered tablo beforo tho
crucifix. Joan lifted It up and her
eyes fell on tho words: "Hy a woman
ho overcame. My a woman ho wns
overcome. A woman was onco his
wenpon. A woman Is now becomo tho
Instrument of his defeat. Ho flndeth
thnt tho weak vessel cannot be
broken."
"Nor shall It!" said Joan, looking
at tho cross beforo her, "by the
strength of Mary the Mother, tho wenk
vessel shall not ho broken!"
As she stooped to blow out the last
candle, a motto on the stem cnught
her eye. Joan took tho candle out of
Its socket nnd road the Inscription
word by word
"Da pacem, Domino, In dlcbus nos
trls." It was her own scroll, the motto of
tho reigning dukes of Hohenstoln n
trango one, doubtless, to bo that of
a fighting race, but, nevertheless, her
father's and her own.
L Whnt did her father's motto, tho
evlcu of her house, upon this Haltlc
stand, fur from tho highlands of
PKornsbug? Mud these wastes onco
bolonged to men of her race? And
this woman, who so regally played tho
mistress of this strungo hermitage,
who was she?
And ns Joan of Hohenstoln blew out
the candle sho mused In her heart
concerning these things.
Tho Duchess Jonn slept soundly, her
dark, boyish head pillowed on tho
full rounded curves of nn nrm thrown
behind her. On-the llttlo velvet
covered tnblo Uesldo tho bed wero her
bolt and Its dependent sword, n faith
ful compaulon In Its shenth of plain
black leather. Under her pillow, nnd
within instant reach of her right hand,
was her father's dagger.

Bent to tho window to enst open tho
attlco. Tho air within felt thick and
lliot. As Werner sot his fnco to tho
opening quick (lashes of summer light
ning flamed alternately whlto nnd lilac
across tho horizon, and ho felt the
spit of hailstones In his fnco, driving
lovel llko so many musket-balls when
tho Infantry fires by platoons.
Above. In tho vaulted chamber,
Joan turned over on her bed, murmur
ing uneasily In her sleep. A whlto
fnco, which for a quarter of an hour
had boon bent down to her dnrk head
ob It lay on the pillow, was suddenly
retracted Into tho darkness nt the
girl's slight movement.
Again, apparently reassured, the
shadowy vlsngo approached ns tho
young duchess Iny without further
motion. Suddenly, nnd for no appar
ent reason, Joan's ecs opened, nnd
who found herself looking with be.
vtldcrmont Into a face that bent
Blown upon her, n white fnco which
'somehow seemed to hung suspended
A white face which somehow seemed
to hang suspended In the dark above
her.
In the dark nbove her Tlio features
wero lit up by tho pulsing lightning
which shor.e In the wild eyes and glit
tered on a knlfehlndn about tho ban
dlo of which were clenched tho tense
fingers of n hand equally detachel.
In a moment Jonn's right hand had
grasped tho dagger under her pillow
Her left shooting upward, closed on
tho nrm which held the threatening
steel. Almost without rising from her
bed she projected herself upon her
enemy, nud the felt her lingers sink
dcop In tho soft curves of a woman's
throat.
Then a shriek, long nnd terrible.
Inhuman and threatening, rang
through tho house. As Joan overbore
her assailant upon the floor, the door
opened, nnd glanrlng upward vho taw
(ho Wordless Man stand on tho
threshold, a candle In one hand nnd
a linked sword In the other.
Tho terrible cry which had rung In
her ears had been his. At Bight of
him Jonn unclasped her fingers from
tho throat of the woman wbo had
-'jcen her hostess nnd roso slowly to
her feet. Tho old man rushed for
ward and knelt beside the prostrate
body of bis mistress.
At tho same moment there came
tho sound of quick footsteps running
up tho stairway. Tho door flew open
and Werner von uncta mirst In, also
sword In hand.
"What Is tho meaning of this." ho
shouted. "Who bns dared to harm
my lady?"
"Go down nnd bring n cup of wine!"
commanded Jonn as soon as he ap
peared. And Werner von Orseln de
parted without a word to do her bid
ding. Meanwhile the Wordless Mnn had
raised his mistress up from tho
ground. "Carry your mistress to that
couch!" said the young duchess, point
ing to the tumbled bed from which n
few minutes beforo she had so hastily
launched herself.
Whilst ho was thus engaged Wer
ner camo In quickly with a silver cup
In his hand.
Jonn took it Instantly and going for
ward she put It to the lips of the wom
an on the bed.
Putting out her hnnds tho woman
took tho cup nnd drank It slowly,
pausing between the draughts to draw
long breaths.
"I must havo strength," bIio said.
"I havo much to say. Then, Joan of
Hohrnsteln, thou shall Judge between
theo nnd me!"
Tho color enmo slowly bnrk to tho
woman's pale fnce, and, nftcr n little,
sho raised herself on tho pillows.
Jonn stood motionless nnd uncompro
mising by the great Iron dogs of tho
chimney.
"You are waiting for mo to speak,
nnd I will spenk. You havo a double
right to know nil. Shall It bo told to
yourself alone, or In tho presenco of
this mnn?"
Sho looked nt Von Orseln ns sho
spoke.
"I havo no secrets In ray life," said
Joan, "thero Is nothing that I would
hldo from him. 8nvo ono thing!" She
added the last words In her heart.
Thero was nn Interval of sllcnco
In Iho room, filled tip by tho hoarse,
persistent booming of tho storm with
out nnd tho shuddering shocks of the
wind on tho lonely house. Then tho
.ivotnnn spoko agnln In a low, dlstlket'
voice.
"8lnco It is your right to know By j
name, I nm Theresn von I.ynnr vlio
havo nlso a right to call myself l
Hohenstoln' nnd your dead fathojs
widow!" J
In an Instnnt the rcscrvo of Joan's
sternly equal mind wns broken up,
She dropped her sword clnttorlng on
tho Jloor nnd started angrily toward
the bed. (
"It Is n-llo most foul," sho cried.'
"my father lived unwed for mnny '
years nay, ever sltico my mother's I
I dentil, who died In giving me life, ho
never so much ns looked on woman. I
1 It Is a thing well known In tho
Duchy!" (
Tho woman did not answer directly.
"Max Ulrlch. bring the sliver cas-!
kot." sho snld. tnklng from her neck
j n llttlo silver key.
Tho Wordless Mnn, seeing her!
1 action, camo forward nnd took the key. I
' Ho went out of tho room, nnd after
an Interval which seemed Interminable
he returned with n peculiarly shaped
casket. Tho woman touched n spring
with well practiced hand, nnd n mil
of pnrchmt'nt fell upon the bed. With
n Ktrnngo smlln she gave It to Joan,
beckoning her with nn upward nod tri
nppronch.
Jonn took tho crackling parchment.
It had threo seals nttnehed to It nnd
ho first part was In her father's hnnd
writing. "I declnro bj these pn'sents that I j
linvi) married, according to the cus- I
touis of llohensteln nnd tho laws of '
iho wnplre. Theresa von I.ynnr. I

Kmlnence the Cardinal Adrlon, Arch
bishop of Cologne nnd Klcctor of the '

After her first shock of surprlso wns '
over Joan noted carefully tho dalo. It '
was 0110 year after her own birth, and
! therefore tho llko period after tho
death of her mother, the openly nc
l.uowidged Duchess of Hohenstoln.
I Joan folded this parchment and
, hnnlod It back. Then sho stood silent
wultlng for nn explanation.
The woman took up her parnblo
calmly, like one who has long compre
hended that such n crisis must ono
day arrive, and who knows her part
thoroughly
