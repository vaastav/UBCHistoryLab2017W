Tho wife of tbo Ozorowitcb has increased
tho stock of Russian royalty to tho extent of
ouo small boy. It happened yesterday.
Tho length of the season of lake naviga
tion this year is without parallel Charters
wore mode yesterday at Lake Michigan ports,
tho latest date over recorded at any of them.
Tho people of Now Orleans yesterday
gathered in a mass-meeting numbering 2,000
souls, and declared that tho unspeakable grati
tude which still lingers in their hearts for the
charily and mercy of their follow-country
men has consecrated their lives to main
tenance of indissoluble national unity and
brotherhood.
Tho English troops have mot tho Afghans,
and appear to have won a signal victory. Ac
cording to tbo account transmitted through
English sources, tho native troops woro out
goncrallcd,* and several strongpositiona which
they held woro turned by the moneuvres of
the invaders, and finally captured after what
tho English oUlcors acknowledge to bo an ob
stinate defense.
Emperor William of Germany, after sev*
oral mouths of release from tho cares of
Ktuto, necessitated by tho wounds ho receiv
ed in the attempted assassination by the
Socialist Nobelino, has resumed tho reins of
Government. Ho arrived at Berlin yester
day, and was greeted with joyful enthusiasm
by tho people. Tbero is plenty of strength
aud wisdom left yet in tho fine old monarch.
Both llousA of Congress adjourned yes
terday until Monday, having transacted a
moderate volume of business. Mr. Boen-
T\yo, in tbo House, called for and obtained
im order for an investigation by tho Commit
tee on Civil-Service Reform of tho charge
that ho was corruptly influenced lu bis voto
in favor of tho bill making the Government
responsible for tho interest on the 8.C5 Dis
trict of Columbia bonds.
Tho Senate Investigating Committee will
rusuma operations next Monday, and it Is
said Jim Anderson will bo brought from Ne
vada at public expense to recant some of the
lies ho told before tho Houso Committee.
None of Anderson's previous stories ncod
denying, and the Allison Committee would
do better to allow him to remain In Nevada,
where there is a fair chance for the exercise
of Ids peculiar talents lu tho manufacture of
bulletins for the benefit of tho mining-stock
gamblers.
There is tho best of reason for believing
that the Government is thoroughly iu earnest
in tho prosecution of the Custom-House
construction conspirators, ami that the in*
dictmeuts will bo poshed to trial with a view
to convicting every entity man. The em*
ploymeut of Judge Lxwbzkcs to conduct the
cases for tho Government and the people in*
dicatos that such will be the policy. His In*
inductions ore understood to bo simply that
the prosecution shell bo conducted earnestly
and fairly. It is gratifying to know that in
iLtec trials tho Government will be on the
right side, which has not always proved to
Lu tho case.
Tho proposition introduced Into (be Coun*
til by Aid. ItyaM' of tbs Fourteenth Ward,
to nGist rict the political divisionsof the city
nui-,1 have been suggested by some personal
or factional motive; it has no merit in itself,
end ihi.ru is uo occasion for agitating tbs
liitvaiion ut this timo. There La no such dis
parity between the voting population of tbs
fcoverul words os to work any special injustice,
and perhaps uo rearrangement at tho present
tiiuu could equalize the voting strength with
lullicieut accuracy to insure any permanency.
lu u year from now we shall have a new
United States census, which will furnish a
trustworthy basis for rcdistrictlug iu on in*
luliigent way. Aid. Kras’s ward docs
not cost 80 many votes as noma of the
other wards in the city from which no com
plaint in made. If he has this word especially
in mind, however, a Blip of it might be taken
off the Fourteenth and attached to the Tenth,
which cast the smallest vote at the late elec
tion. Would that mit Aid. Utah ? With
this single exception, the Gonnoil abonld let
(he ward* stand as they are for the present,
rather than incur (ho confusion of a rear*
mngement which would not hold beyond (be
next census.
The English have won a great and Almost
decisive victory in Afghanistan. Tbo col
nmn under Gen. Bobcats, which was the
central one, hoe defeated the Afghans with
groat loss, and captured all their cannon and
material of war. This not only opens a clear
road by this route, but it opens the way to
Cabal, and leaves Oen. Hodctts free to co
operate either with the northern or south
ern column, and must end In tbo Immediate
retreat of any forces that are opposing them
in order to save themselves from being
(United and cut oil. The way Into Afghan
istan is non* open, and the next stand, if an
other Is made, must be at Cabnl.
The British Parliament convened yester
day for a short session. Her Majesty’s
speech was much briefer than usual, and is
notable only for Its omissions. The princi
pal topic is, of course, the ponding war In
Afghanistan, and even this is passed over
with the more forma) announcement re
quired by law. There will be no organized
opposition to tbe address in reply to this
speech, the Liberals announcing their pur
pose to content themselves with criticising
the action of tbo Government in plunging
the country into a useless war, and ouo
which will eventually result In weakening
England and benefiting Russia In tho East.
It remains to be determined who shall foot
the bilk incurred in the war upon the
Afghans,—England or India,—and the quos
lion k not likely to be settled without an
animated controversy in Parliament The
policy of the Government In the matter was
yesterday revealed through a notice in the
Houro of Commons by the Undersecretary
of Stato for India that ho should on Monday
next submit a motion that the expenses of
the worbo defrayed from the Indian revenue.
This proceeding Is likely to provoke spirited
opposition on tbo part of the Liberals, who
maintain that in this triumph of Jingoism
the Jingoes should settle the score, instead
of saddling it upon poor tox*riddco, bank
rupt India. Hkivbt Fawcett gave notice
yesterday that he should oppose the motion.
THE WORK OF CONOBEM.
Wo shonld infer from ths prompt notion in
tho Honso on two of the appropriotion bills
that there Is a strong disposition In Congress
to moke the present session a practical and
useful one In a business sense. The session
wilt be necessarily brief, as the life of the
present Congress expires March 8 next, and
probably a couple of weeks will bo lost on
account of tbo Christmas holidays. It Is
well, therefore, to got tho business of appro
priations well under way before entering
upon political discussions and projects for
new legislation. Nevertheless there is some
important work which tho present Congress
might do to advontoge. Among tbo subjects
that deserve attention ore the following:
Tho election frauds and outrages in tho
Southern States. It is not likely that the
Democratic Honso will consent to any legis
lation looking to tho better protection of the
colored voters in the exorcise of their polit
ical rights, but tho subject should be so
thoroughly canvassed as to expose tho pur
pose of the Southern whites to nullify the
constitutional amendments, and to place
upon the Democratic majority in the House
the responsibility of refusing the aid asked
by the Executive for tho enforcement of the
law. Tbo discussion will be eminently
proper in Congress, for tho abases and out
rages complained of occurred in the Con
gressional elections, and it is made the duty
of Congress to pass such legislation os may
bo necessary to carry out 4he provisions of
the Constitution. The Democrats in the
Honso will probobly attempt to stifle all in
vestigation and discussion in this matter, bat
Mr. Blaine's resolution in the Senate will
lead np to a thorough review of tho question.
It is not easy to see how the Honso, after
appointing the Pornm Committee and sanc
tioning its peculiar proceedings, can avoid
taking some action in regard to tho Tildzn
cipher dispatches. The Republicans appear
to have come to tho conclusion that they can
afford to lot tbo matter stand where it is.
Probably they are right, for the case has
been made out so clearly in tho absence of
any explanation that no intelligent person
can doubt that there was a Democratic con
spiracy to secure the Presidency for Tilden
by bribery ond purchase. If there is any
virtue in the cry of “ fraud," which tho
Democrats have used so freely since the last
Presidential election, they will feel tho neces
sity of clearing their own skirts.
There are also some important matters for
legislation that will come up. Tho Banking
aud Currency Committee in (ho House will
probably not make another effort to foroe tbo
ropoal of the Resumption act upon the Sen
ate, because they mast recognize how futile
such on effort would be. But there is one
measure in aid of resumption, or as a corol
lary to it, which ought to bo passed, viz. t
to authorize tbo Secretary of tho Treasury
to receive tho legal-tender notes for customs
duties. Secretory Shuman believes that he
has such authority aud has announced his
intention to proceed upon this theory, but it
will bo belter to give him the warrant of a
special Act. Indeed, greenbacks would have
already been receivable for duties by law if
the Ewino party, which professes so much
love for them, had not defeated a Senate bill
to that end in the closing hours of the last
session.
As regards silver, there are (wo or three
propositions to bo considered. First, as to
the legalization, or the redemption and ro*
tirement, of the trade dollar, the anomalous
character of* which has occasioned much
scandal and considerable loss. Secondly, a
meant for preventing the National banks
from discriminating against the standard sil*
ver dollar, and providing a penalty for such
defiance of the law. Thirdly, and moat im
portant of all, tho question of free coinage
and stiver certificates which shall place the
silver dollar on a plane with the gold dollar.
Intelligent discussion of this subject will be
of value, even if tho present Congress ahaii
not bo able to agree upon free coinage. It
is not unlikely, too, in connection with this
and the resumption question, that consider*,
tion will bs given to the proposition to com*
pel the banka to redeem their own notes In
coin.
There are other matters in which Coogreae
might do the country groat service if it would.
The passage of a law for free shipping would
be a long atop in tho direction of progress.
The disposition of tho question of transfer*
ring tho management of Indian Affairs to the
XIIK CRiCAGO TRIBUNES FRIDAY. DECEMBER 6, 1878.
War Department ought to bo expected, M a
special joint committee has had the subject
in hand. The report of Mr. llkwitt’s Com
mittee on the condition of the laboring
classes may bo nsofnl if it avoid demagog
ism. There should bo an agreement on
some plan for popnlar bonds or a postal
system of savings. Indeed, there is an
Abundance of opportunities for (ho present
Congress to mnko lUclf useful if it will
abandon party scheming and go earnestly at
work.
WHAT THE BANKS WILL DO.
The Milwaukee evening paper called the
WiMonsin regards the proposition requiring
the National banka to redeem tfaotr issues in
coin in the nature of a direful throat.. To
ask them to redeem their notes in cola would,
in the opinion of the Wi*on*in, be perse
cution t not only that, bat torture. M Their
case," says that paper, “is very much like
that of those obstinate Jews in the Middle
Ages, who objected to surrendering their
boarded treasures to needy Earls and barons.
The custom then was to secure a Jew who
had money, and to pull his finger nails out
by the roots, or extract his tooth one by ouo,
until he was persuaded, by these gentle eu
treatmente, to give it up. This method al
most always succeeded. By the time the
second or third eye-tooth was uprooted, or a
half-dozen finger nails were drawn, the Jew
was ready to yield his ducats.**
To require the National banka to redeem
their notes In coin after Jon. 1, the some os
the Government will have to do with its
greenbacks, Is as bad, according to this sym
pathetic editor, as pulling out finger nails or
tearing ont teeth one by one. Tbo intima
tion is that the* banka will not yield their
golden dacata to the holder of their promises
unless torture equal to this is applied. We
have a belter opinion of the Notional banks,
ond don't believe they are so averse to re
deeming their notes in coin as the WUcontin
intimates.*
But in ease Congress does require the
National banks to redeem their notes in coin
—(we said com, not gold)—the Wucoruin sots
forth the kind of retaliation the banks will
resort to in punishment of the Government
for making them redeem (heir notes In coin
at tbo option of the holders. It says:
If the prtvlleso of redemption In greenbacks It
withdrawn from them, U will be the Government
ami not the banka that will stiQor In rnnsoqueace.
The Government renames specie payments on the
l«t of January, Every bank now has a reserve
fund In (Roonbaeksfor the redemption of Its notes.
If tho Government requires the hunks to redeem In
coin, they will, of course, call on tho Government
for coin In exenanee for their sreenbacka. There
would then be a lively time In the Treasury De*
partraent. Secretary Siikiiman's reserve of gold
and sliver, with wnlch be expects to maintain ro
eumplion, would melt awar Uko anow in a spring
son. The greenbacks would ullo up in mountain
one meases In tho Treasury vaulta. As • measure
to exhaust the stock of coin lu tho Treasury, Tub
Tiurukk'splan would be a great success; as a
measure for intimidating the hanks, it would be a
signal failure. They would no doubt meet it with
calm composure.
Suppose tho National banks were short
sighted ond malicious enough to pursue just
this course, and should moke an organized
“rna" on tho Government for coin, and
shonld pour in a volume of greenbacks that
would “exhaust tho stock of coin in the
Treasury,* what would bo tho consequences?
1. Tbo Treasury would suspend redemp
tion of its notes, and instantly they would
depreciate several per cent.
2. Tho moment the greenbacks declined
ovon J or i per cent below coin, every broker
and speculator in theUnitcdStates would send
home tho notes of the banks and demand
their redemption in coin. If they refused,
their notes would bo protested and their
security bonds in the custody of tho Bank
Controller in Washington would be sold out
for coin with which to redeem their notes.
U. Tho greenbacks would be paid oat by the
Government end go into general circulation
at a discount anywhere from 1 to 10 per
cent; bat, being the cheaper currency and
not redeemable, tho whole run for coin would
be on the bonks, and their notes, being worth
more than the greenbacks, would not circu
late any longer than the gold speculators
could pick them up and send them homo for
redemption. Thus the banks would bb hoist
on tbelrown petard most beautifully. They
would bo “ busted ” banks mighty soon after
“exhausting tho stock of coin in tho Treas
ury,” and tboro would he no sympathy felt
for them after being guilty of such stupid
malice.
'When tho banks are required to redeem
their own notes in coin, they will not daro
to make a “ ran ”on tho Notional Treasury
for fear of the consequences to themselves.
They will quietly provide their vaults with
gold and silver without disturbing the stock
in tho National Treasury. They will all be
come bi-metallists and join tho rest of tho
community in demanding free coinage of
silver. They will insist on tills country pos
sessing as largo a stock of silver as Franco
enjoys; they will, in short, become good sen
sible institutions, and see things from iho
people's point of view, which to them will bo
a new light. ,
THE CANADIAN NOSE OUT OF JOINT.
Flunkoylsu to tho contrary notwithstand
ing, democratic Canada is beginning to
kick. It protests against a Court, against
Coart otiquette,against flunkoyl»m,and every
form of toadyism. Tbe Toronto MaU, a
Toiy paper, sounds tho first blast against an
advertisement that appeared in the Montreal
papers during the time tbe Royal pair were
In that city, containing an official announce
ment that “ladies desirousof being admitted
to tbe reception held by her Royal Highness,
at Q-.UO p. in. on Saturday, Nov. (10, at tho
Windsor Hotel, must wear low dresses, un
less they present a doctor's certificate of 111
health, in which cose they may come with
the front of the dress cut squarej bat in no
case ore they U> appear in high-necked
dresses.” The MaU pours alternate
broadsides of ridicule and serious or
guueni into this advertisement and
riddles it from stem to stern, first, upon the
ground that tbe climate does not admit of
that style of dress \ second, that It is im
modest, and that the Canadian women are
not accustomed to unbosom themselves j
and third, that tbe attempt to establish
Court etiquette is a serious mistake. Oa this
point'it says t
We are a toys) people, favorable to monarchical
tnalltutiona; but wo urn far removed fnnii St.
Jotues'i auu a Court can take no root la ault where
the echo or the ax aud logins chain of the back*
wood* rings with uo uncertain round through the
airecta of our commercial or political mt-tropolla.
We have not the element* to constitute a real
Court. A mock Court would be a deplorably bur*
Ivaque, from which tho good *em* of all couceroed
will, we feel aura, happily deliver ue.
The indignation of the Mail over this per*
emptory ukase is natural, and it is highly
probable (but it struck the ladies of
Montreal in the same manner. They may
have complained some at the obligation to
unbosom themselves on a cold, frosty night,
but the real objection ahould have been
made at tbe order to appear in public In a
style of undress which is usually reserved
for the privacy of their retiring rooms, aud
to display those charms of person which
hitherto modesty has required them to con
ceal, as the M/ie qua non of admission to the
presence of the Princess Louux and the
inspection of the Marquis of Lome.
It In not ft very cheerful comment npon this
Court nonsense ami flnnkoyism that the
first official order from the Chamberlain
should have been ft command to tho woman
of Canada to unveil thoir charms, and that if
they were desirous to Razo At Royalty, semi,
nudity, in Hen of n doctor's certificate, wan
tho essential requisite. Modesty to tho rear,
vulgarity to tho front, or tho degradation of
A doctor's certificate, war tho tint greeting
of Royalty to tho women of Montreal. Un
donbtcdly thero arc snobs and flunkeys of
tho female kind in Montreal who would risk
oven that last struggle of (he belle of the
period that would bare brought her freedom
rather than not have gained access to her
Royal Highness, but with tho majority it
must haveeost a straggle, and doctors' cer
tificates moat have been abundant.
But why should this order have been lev
eled at tho women alone? The Marquis of
Lome is o Scotchman. Why did he not issue
an order that tho men of Montreal should off
with their trousers and appear in kilts unless
they could bring & certificate from the doc
tor that their legs wore queer and crooked,
or that they bad tho rheumatism or
some other complaint which would be ag
gravated by exposure to tho weather? It
certainly Is not as dangerous nor Is it ns
much of a hardship for a man to go round
with bare legs os for a woman to go ronnd
with boro neck and shoulders, with not even
tho saving clause of a dross front, cut square.
Aml'yet ono can faintly conceive of tho bowl
of Indignation that would go np from the
men of Canada, and (ho stern resolution that
would fire thoir hearts never to sacrifice their
(rouson at the dictate of flunkoyUm.
There is good hope that flunheyism will
moot with a decided set-back when its first
blow comes from tho strongest Tory paper
in Canada, and wo may confidently expect
that tho Liberal papers will follow H up with
blows equally as telling, and that tho men
who would not boro their.legs pt.tbo com
mond of Royalty will demand and obtain the
right for modest women to appear la the
presence of Royally in the garb of modesty.
Meanwhile other discontented individuals
are turning up in various quarters. Tho
Scotchmen of Ottawa nro boiling mad be
cause tho Marquis and Princess, hav
ing allowed them to give out that
the St. Andrew's concert was to be
under thoir patronage and presence, staid
awoy from it and sent no excuse. Then,
again, tho people having organized a proces
sion in which tho Marquis and Princess wore
to take part, tho latter unceremoniously
abandoned it just after it had started, so that
U bad to go over the route without the main
features of tho show. Lastly. Royal rudeness
has broken out in a very dangerous quarter,
a luncheon having been given to tho repre
sentatives of the English press with no Invi
tations issued to the representatives of tho
American or Canadian press. So far os
American reporters are concerned, it is of
little consequence, as it was none of their
affair, and the nomadic American reporter is
happily so constituted that ho oau got a bite
most anywhere, and wilt moke a sumptuous
meal whoro the average person would starve.
Bat with tho Canadian reporters tins Is a
home thrust. They arc not of tho sort to
stand idly by and seo thoir English asso
ciates bidden in to tho feast while
they aro loft out on tho sidewalk.
Thero will be a savage sharpening of poncils
and noto-books will bristle with epithets,
which will bo still further amplified from the
vocabulary of tho city editor when ho comes
to roviso copy. Shall tho London Tima and
Telegraph and Graphic bosk in tho sunshlno
of Royalty and feast sumptuously at Ridean
Hall, while tho Toronto Mail and Globe and
Montreal Herald hang round the stops, boat
ing their breasts as they hoar tho loud bas
soon? Tho Canadian noso is out of joint at
tho very first sniff of Royolty, and there is
trouble brewing among tho slobs oud shingles
of democratic Ottawa. How easily all this
might havo been avoided If tho Royal pair
hod sot np their littlo Court in Manitoba,
whore Bitting Bull would have mode no
complaint at a baro.leggod order and his nu
merous squaws would have felt it no indig
nity to have appeared before tho Princess In
tho full Court costume of a plug hat and a
pair of bracelets. *
THE COUNTY BONDS.
Tho revision of (be count of votes on the
Issue of Court-House bonds boa progressed
far enough to make it almost certain that a
majority will bo found in favor of tbe propo
sition. It Is easy to understand that errors
should bnvo been mode In canvassing tbe
voto on this matter, and vro bavo no doubt
tbo revision will bo correct. Tbe result Is
duo portly to a defect In tbo law as to tbe
kind of majority required, and partly to tbe
action of tbe Democratic Committee. Tbo
law is defective in not requiring for the.
adoption of such a proposition a majority of
all tbe votes cast at tbo election, instead of
merely a majority of those voting on tbe
proposition itself. As a rule, all who desire
to voto for- a scheme of this kind are careful
to do so, while largo numbers of those who
would vote afjaintt It do not take the pains
to scratch or rewrite their tickets. Tbe
Democratic Committee, In this instance,
became tbo confederate of tbe bid County
King, and printed their tickets in sneb
manner as to enable tbe peddlers to tear oil
the vote “ against" and leave tbe Demo
cratic ballot a vote M for w tbe'propositlon.
It was this circumstance znolnly which en.
oblod the promoters of tbe scheme to seenro
a small majority of tbe votes cast upon it,
though iu a largo minority of all tbo voters
at tbe election.
It may be that the Hoard will bo restrained
from issuing these bonds, notwithstanding
tho popular vote, on tbo ground (bat tbo
reaolutiou submitting the proposition was
not passed thirty days before the day of
election. It will require a decision of Court
to determine this question, bat It would
seem to be sufficient cause for an injunction
against the issue. Any question of an un
usual character, and submitted separately,
certainly demands a public notice at least as
long ts a usual and general election; if this
wore not required, then it would be possible and
easy for a County Board to spring (be ques
tion of issuing bonds upon the people the
day before election and carry it with a
very few votes, while tho great majority, of
voters would bo ignorant of the fact that a
question of borrowing money was in Issue.
'We presume this view of the matter will be
properly tested. At the same time there is
not now so much reason for opposition to
the issuing of the bonds as there was i>ro
vious to tho election. Then it was a matter
of doubt whether the old King would not be
able to retain tho control of the County
Board, In which case tho authority to borrow
(750,000 would have been a public calamity.
The King candidates were defoatedi how
ever, and there is ground for the hope that
the new Board will administer tho affairs of
the couuty honestly and economically. In
that event, it will perhaps be better to build
the Ccurt-iluuio on nerrowud thou L>y
direct taxation ; but this will not hold If the
new Hoard shall continue appropriations and
expenditures on the old scale, and exhaust
the full limit of taxation, besides borrowing
tho money to go on with tho Court-House
work. If the present Board shall finally ac
quire (ho right to issue these bonds, tho pub
lic will expect a careful disbursement of the
funds and a reduction In tho tax-levy for next
year, ______
SHALL WE HAVE AMERICAN SHIPS!
The House of Representatives hod the
subject of so amending (he navigation laws
as to admit an increase of American ocean
going ships brought before 11 on the motion
of Mr. Cißixn Haiuhson Instructing a com
mittee to report a bill to that effect. The
resolution Was adopted. Tho names of those
voting for and against it have not reached
mvbnt the reporters say the Republicans
generally voted against tho resolution. We fad
to see why there should be any party division
on such a question as this,—one which appeals
directly to the interests of every citizen per
sonally, and also to tho groat material Inter
ests of (he country. We Invite the render
to look at a few foots. In 18G0 the total
foreign trade of the United States was thus
made up:

Total.
1507.847,737 *253,040,703
From which it will bo seen that in 1800
two-thirds of all tbo track to ond from this
country was done in Amorlcon ships.
For tbo year ending Juno 80, 1877, twelve
years after tbo close of tbo War, wo find that
tbo vnlno of onr trade was:
Import* i...| 402.007,510

Total *310,000,381 *830,080,330
Those wore the proportions of tbe ocean
trade carried in American and foreign ves
sels. Tho proportions arc more than re.
versed since 1800. Then two-thirds of tbo
business was done In American vessels. Now,
nearly throe-fourths is done in foreign ves
sels.
Id 1800 tho aggregate tonnage of tbo
United States was 5,451,928 tons. On tbo.
30lb of Jane, 1877, It was 4,242,000 tons;
and in June, 1876, it was 4,312,704 tons,— o
falllng-off in the year of SD,63G tons.
Tbo country has now reached on average
annual trade equal to $1,300,000,000, and we
bavo to employ tbroo foreign vessels to ono
American to carry our own products to mar
ket. Foreign vessels actually come to tbe
United States empty, in order to carry Amor*
{can cotton, petroleum, tobacco, breadstuff*,
and provisions to other countries. If the
cost of carrying this merchandise bo equal to
20 per cent of its value, then $240,000,000
are paid out annually for freight, of which
foreign merchants got tbree*fourths and our
merchants tbo remainder.
The navigation laws of the United States
prohibit tho purchase of o foreign-built ship;
prohibit tho purchaso of an American-built
vessel which boa once been owned in a for
eign nation. No foreign vessel can engage
in any woy in tho domestic trade or coasling
trade of tbo United, States, fbongh Amerl
con vessels havo an absolnto monopoly of
this domestic trade, still tho tonnage last
year showed a falling*off of nearly 80,000
tons, tho now vessels not equaling those
wrecked and otherwise dropped out of
service. While this general wreck of our
carrying trade is going on, at a loss perhaps
of $200,000,000 a year, Oongrets cannot bo
tortured into a consideration of amending
tho navigation laws, and It Is oven stated
that any voto on that question will in ail
probability bo a party ono.
Our exports are annually increasing, both
in bulk and value. Wo are just entering
upon a now ora in trade. Wo aro about
oddlng a long list of manufactures to tbe
balk and value of out exports. Old settlors
in the West can recall tho time whoa they
would have to wait at a landing ou the river
several days, perhaps a week, for a boat to
cony them to their dostinotion. Tho shippers
of American cotton, breadstuff*, provisions,
and manufactures would now havo to wait at
our seaports .days, weeks, and perhaps a
month, for transportation wore It not for tbe
foreign vessels, which come hither to
do business which ' our laws peremp
torily forbid onr doing in onr own vessels.
Wo da not moan to say that it is written in
tho law that no American vessels shall bo
built or bo employed m tho foreign trade;
but It is o fact, well known and recognized
for the last seventeen years, that no American-,
built vessel con be built except at a cost
which excludes H from competing with ves
sels built elsewhere. Tho result is that but
few ocean-going vessels aro built In this
country unless subsidized; and the whole
carrying trade Is passing Into tho bands of
foreign ship-owners. That Is called “pro
tection ”to American industry 1 It is
every ship-yard, driving our flag from tho
oceon, pouring hundreds of millions of
dollars' freight money into the hands of
foreign shlp-ownePb, and making us de
pendents upon foreign merchants for tbe
mesns of getting what wo havo to sell to
market Tho profit of ship-owning is in the
business of carrying. American honor, and
American dignity, and American labor, It is
assumed, will be outraged If an -American
merchant shall purchase a forofgo-buiU
steamer, change her name, and, raising the
American flag over her, shall carry American
com to a foreign market. Hut It is not con
sidered inconsistent with American honor,
and dignity, and labor for tbe same merchant
to expend a like sum in foreign-made goods,
bring them to ibis country in a foreign-built
vessel, pay SIOO,OOO for freight to a foreign
ship-owner, andselUngbisfarolgn-made goods
inourmarket,beve the same vessel carry back
a full cargo of American provisions, paying tho
freight money to tho same foreign ship*
owner. To maintain our dignity we send
abroad for vessels to carry our freight; and
think we save the honor which would be sac
rificed if that vessel and the freight money
was owned by an American merchant* Bo
completely has the American flog been ex
cluded from the foreign trade of oar own
country, and so completely are the foreign
lines in possession of tbo carrying business
that, whenever they choose, they can ** pool 11
their laming*, advance (heir rates, and plun
der the producers. Breadstuff* sell abroad
at the world's prices; every cent added to
the cost of transportation Is taken
from the price of grain in the
hauls of the producer. Wo are now
paying ocean freights largely in advance
of what we would have to pay If tho ocean
had its proper supply of American vessels.
Abolish the prohibitory law. Allow Ameri
can merchants to buy ships, nail or steam,
wherever they can be had, and make them
American vcsbols, and the flog will become
again familiar in foreign ports. Oar ooeao
trade will go back to what It was In 1860,
American ships engaged in carrying Ameri
can goods. Every farmer, every mechanic,
every mannfactnrer, every producer of cot
ton, wool, petroleum, pork, lard, beef, and
broadstnffs in the land Is directly end
pecuniarily interested in free ships and cheap
navigation, gnd yet li Is said that Jem*
JloActr, a ship-builder who Is waiting on
Providence for a subsidy, con so control the
whole Republican, petty In Congress as to
mako that party the protector of our In
famous navigation laws.
Sometimes one letter makes a great deal of
difference, as everybody knows. For example,
yesterday morning Tnn Tribpkb printed tbo
following paragraph:

rata letter: “The Milwaukee Witeiumln boldly

w*re already conceded that me stiver dollar le a

am an accomplice. 1 admit the complicity, bat
deny the felony.”
. The trouble was In the use of ad Instead of
an fin the word M demonetization.” It ought
(o have been remonetization. Hie Wisconsin

No man In the United States has such a good
opportunity to know what other people think
of him as the President has Just alter Issuing

men In Congress take a rattle at him, bat sev

he does not say In the free and easy way lor

Washington, D. C., Dec. R—The following
Is tba resolution which Representative Urcptoa*
had passed to-days
Wubukas, The Washington Pott of .Inly 21,
IB7H, contained an article headed. “Tno«o Hprclul
Assessments—VVno Are the Principal Debtors?—
How theiWTilh Clause Was Passed.'* which article,
charging corroptlon against members of Coititrcrs
In reference to the bill providing a permanent form
of government fur tho District of ColuuiUu, con
cluded as follows: “There are some ugly rutnon
afloat as to the manner in which the corruption
fnnd, to secure tho passage of tho bill, vras
disposed of, and who received It. An
Indignant property owner avers that a
Vermont Representative got away with
$25,000 and a Chicago member and a Maryland
member with $12.250 apiece, and that the balance
of the fund went to the Senate Committee. *’
Wmbubas, The facte alleged in said article, and
the averment of an indignant property-owner,

munds will call up on Monday next bU bill re
ported In Mo; last from the Select Committee
to take into consideration the state of the law
respecting tho ascertaining and declaration of
tha result of tho elections of President and
Vice-President of the United States. Thu most
important features of this bill oru tho following;
Sec. 4. Each Stats rib; provide, by law enacted
prior to the dnr in this set turned for tho appoint
ment of thoelectioni, tor tho trial and determina
tion of anv controversy concerning the appoint
ment of tbo Electors before the nine fixed fur trio
meeting of tbo Electors, in any manner tt shall
doom expedient, and aucji decision shall govern la
tho countine of the Electors! votes.
Hoc. 0. oiler some preliminaries,goes on to enact
that no Electoral veto or vutus from any Siam
from which batons return has been received shall be
rejected by tho affirmative votes of both Unmci.
If more than ono return or pspor pnroortlng to he
a rslnrn from a stale snail have been reculved by
tbo President of the Senate, those vote*, ami those
only, shall be counted which shall have been regu
larly given by the Electors who are shown to have
been appointed; but In case there shall arise the
question winch of two or mure of such State’s (rt ■

as Electors the two Houses, acting separately,
shall concurrently decide Is supported by
the decision of the tribunal of such State
so provided for by Us Legislature. And in mch

snail be counted which the two Hoaxes, nrtinr
separately, shall concurrently decide to be lawful

tiisle.
Another Important feature of the bill la tho
section which takes It entirely out of tho power
of the {’resident of the Senate to exercise any
judicial authority over the returns. The tellers
are to count and report. It will be remembered
that Senator Edmunds agreed with Mr. Conk
