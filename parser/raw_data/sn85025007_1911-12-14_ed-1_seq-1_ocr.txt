Bodies Found.
FIVE FIRES RAGE IN MINE.
Stories of Victims Written on Mine
Walls?"Well, Royt, Guess the Jig
is up With us.*'
Briceville, Tenn., Dec. 14.?Brice
ville today surrendered entirely to
despair, for Sam Miller and his four
helpers, who had left messages on the
?walls of the Cross Mountain Mine
passages as they fled from the dread
ed black damp, have been found
dead.
As Miller, who knew the mine bet
ter than anyone else, succumbed, it is
now held impossible thct anyone else
escaped.
Even the government rescuers are
doubtful whether any more living
men will be found.
Five fires are raging in the mines.
Since last Saturday Miller and his
party had been groping their way,
seeking fresh air and running away
from the fatal afterdamp.
The story of their wanderings is f
told in part on the walls of the mine
in Sam's own hand. Miller and four
men made a compact to stick togeth
er, going on and on in search of the
open air until their food was gone.
Then Sam wrote on the wall: "Well,
boys, guess the jig's up."
Early today a rescuer stumbled
over a body. I-I13 lantern showed
four more bodies lying beside it. He
recognized Sam Miller and next to
him lay his boy Emmett. Their
clothes were searched for farewell
notes, but none were found.
It is now believed the total death
list will not greatly exceed 100. In
cluding the bodies recovered the to
tal known dead is >61 and at least 40
more are believed to be inside.

Cleveland, 0., Dec. 14.?Carrying
out the dissolution order of the
United States Supreme Court, the
Standard Oil Company of New Jersey',
| through its Ohio oflices, today is busily
engaged in solving the probablem of
disposing of its vast telegraph system.
1 In breaking "p this system, which
I had terminate in Now York, Pittsburg,
Chicago, San Francisco, and all oil
I centers, a dream of a gigantic inde
pendent telephone system to rival the
Bell Company is ended. ,
i The plans was to use tbe Standard's j
telegraph liner for the independent
f service and it was admitted that a
formidable rival to the "Bell" could
be placed in the field. Now, however,
with the Standard planning to sever
all private telegraph connections such
an arrangement is impossible.
The Standard's terminal offices in
Chicago, Pittsburg and other cities
will be abolished December 21. After
that the Standard will use commercial
wires for its interstate business, al
though each subsidiary company may
1 retain the private lines within its own
^ territory.

sage Out of Amerlcans"?Blood-thirsty
Villain at L.arge.
Albany, N. Y., Dec. 14.?Scores of
detectives and volunteers today are
searching for Ned Denig, an Italian
farm hand, suspected of having mur
dered Mrs. Ann Morner, a rich widow
and her three children, Arthur, 2S,
Edith, .20, and Blanche, 17.
Their bodies, horribly mutilated
with a hatchet, were found buried in
a cow stable in the rear of the Mor
uer farm house in Blooming Grove,
last night.
On a piano in the farm house the
police today found a note scribbled in
poor Italian: "Italian make sausage
out of Americans."
It was believed the murder had
been committed for the purpose of
robbery, but the police today found
Mrs. Morner's purse containing $100
in money and several checks lying in
plain view.
The body of Arthur Morner was
not found in the first search and was
uncovered several hours later. The
bodies of the mother and two daugh
ters were found close to each other
while the body of the son was buried
deeper than the others. The posi
tion of the body of the son leads the
authorities to believe that he was
the first victim.

pear Against Them.
New York, Dec. 14.?It "was re
ported in the office of the District
Attorney that William Earl Dodge
Stokes, millionaire hotel owner, is
dying in his apartments at the Ho
tel Ansonia. He passed an unusual
ly bad night and today, it was said,
his life was hanging by a thread.
Information regarding Stokes' condi
tion was refused at his apartments.
Stokes, who was operated on last
Tuesday night for abcess of the kid
ney, is said to have sunk rapidly dur
ing last night, and it was necessary
to give him stimulants to keep him
alive. lie is said to have rallied
slightly today, but it is known that
he is in a serious condition. The
last statement of his physicians, giv
en out last night, admitted that he
was dangerously ill. Today no in
formation was forthcoming.
Tn the Criminal Court building to
day, it was said that Mrs. Stella
Singleton, sister of Lillian Graham,
was suffering from nervous prostra
tion and was not able to stand the
strain of the witness box in the trial
of Lillian Graham and Ethel Conrad
for shooting Stokes' legs.
Before the trial opened, it was ex
pected the defense would call one or
two unimportant witnesses, and that
all the addresses would be made to
day, the case going to the jury to
morrow morning.
Summing up the case of Lillian
Graham and Ethel Conrad, show
girls who shot W. E. D. Stokes, mil
lionaire hotel proprietor, was ex
pected to begin this afternoon, with
the prospect that the case would go
to the jury to-morrow morning.
It was said at the Ansonia today
that Stokes was still in a serious con
dition, though his physicians were
confident of his recovery.
As soon as court opened, Attorney
Jordan, representing the girls, an
nounced that the defense was
through.
Assistant District Attorney Buck
ner then called Police Inspector Rus
sell, who repeated the story the
girls told him on the day of their ar
rest. It did not differ materially from
the story they told on the witness
stand, except that they made no men
tion of Stokes having taken a pistol
from Miss Graham and firing two
shots.
The state then closed and Attor
ney Robert M. Moore, for the defense,
moved the dismission of the indict
ment on the ground that the defense
had not been permitted to complete
its cross-examination of Stokes, be
cause of his illness. This was denied.
Moore then made the closing ad
dress for the defense.

sleuth, has been unable to find the
slightest clew to Waldron's whereabouts
ami preparations are being made to
drag the river in the hope of recover
ing his body, the police being of the
opinion that the juror committed sui
cide because of homesickne-s aud busi
ness troubles.
