The President's message is an able
and interesting state paper. The sug
gestions to Congress are all timely
and pertinent, and will no doubt receive
immediate attention from that body.
Hon. W. A. Pledger of Alabama, is
in Washington awaiting his commission
as Postmaster at Athens, Georgia. Mr.
Pledger is editor of the Athens Blade,
Chairman of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee, of Georgia, and one of
the most energetic and thoroughly qual
ified young men in the state. Mr.
Pledger is doubly deserving of the ap
pointment, and we have every reason to
believe that the President will give it to
him, and thus please nine-tenths of the
Republicans of Georgia.

Many men burned in the mines by the
explosion of gas owe their deaths to the fact
that they have persisted in working without
any shirts or otner protection lor their
bodies save pantaloons. Often it happens
that an explosion of gas occurs which would
rove comparatively slight in its effects but
or the great surface over which the burns
extend. The treatment closes all the pores
of the skin over the burned parts, and where
these are extensive, the patient experiences
a sort of asphyxia seems to be smothered
to death. Even burns of slight depth, if
embracing a large surface of the body,
almost invariably prove fatal. It is against
the rule in many jniues for the operatives to
work without shift-, and it would be well to
enforce the rule in all the mines and reduce
the number of fatal at least 10 per cent.
There is great temptation to throw off the
clothing in some mines, especially those
which are very deeD, as the temperature
rises 1 degree for every fifty feet in depth,
and in many mines the air that is forced
Into the chambers becomes heated by the
steam pipes in the down cast, and loses much
of its vitalizing quality before it reaches the
limits of the mine. But where there is gas,
stripping is dangerous. Thomas Riley, who
died recently, owes his death to cutting off
the sleeves of his shirt and leaving it unbut
toned in the back.

Washington. Dec. 8. As soon as the
Criminal Court opened this inorntngGuiteau
shouted out, "A crank in Chicago says I
talked with him about thisctt.se! I don't
know the man. It is false."
Colonel Corkhill called an the first witness
Mrs. Julia M. Wilson, of Leadville, Col.
She knew L. W. (Juiteau from her earliest
recollection. He was her uncle. Witness
gave a most feelirg account ot the life and
chaiacter of her mother, Mn. Maynard,
(who it had been alleged b the deLjnse had
died insane, but who really
died from pneumonia in 1?.V.) Her
mother was noted for her 1 v I dispo
sition and Christian character, aud her vir
tues are remembered and xikt n ot to this
day. Witness was her nurse and constant
at endant-up to the time of hei death, and
never saw the sughttst indication of flighti-
ness or insanity. ltness was questioned
in rela Ion to the evidence of Uavi', one of
the witnesses for he defense. Davis testified
that ke wad at one time in Mrs. Maynard's
room auring iier last illness, and she was
very fiightyaud incoherent, and continually
charged him (U.ms) to rook mit for her
husband and children, for she fen red they
wouia go to me i'oor House. Tl;e witness
(Mrs. Yilon) smiled iijoredulouiiy while
the question was being put and teplied she
uia not even remember the man Davis.
The dep K-ition f Mr. Turner wasnad, in
which he said: '"I have heari hcrhuoai,d
say she died insane," and witness was ques
tioned in regarJ to it. Scoville objected to
tue reply, "l never heard of it." ani a lively
uiscussion ensuea oeiween juage Porte rand
cjcoviile. Guiteau became nraged at Judge
rorter and shouted, ''Now hold your thun
der till you get lo iha J'iry, Judt , you are
doing t .is sort of thing too much.'' Judge
Poner, without noticing the outburst, con
tinued in the most impressive mani.er to
argue bis joint, when Guiteau broke out
again: "I'm not a crimiral and I won't be
till convicted. 1 won t have thst word
You just hold your elvjuii.ce till vou ret
at tue jury.
Scoville expostulated with him, b;it he
retorted in the most vicious manner, 3hut
up and mind your business, I Ln-v what
I'm doing." Witness was questioned in re
gard to various members of the family, and
stated positive y that she never ?aw indica
tions of liiia -ity in any ot ihem. Speaking
oi me prisoner s tamer, u. .uuueau, the
witiies said: "My uncle Luther viited me
very frequently, and I loved In m nub verv
A I V " lt '
lenuer auec ion. our wnoic lanuiv were
delighted with his lovely ChrUt is i charac
ter. ana such a mougm mil m- angnt l n
anv degree be of unsound mind never en
tered my head." Witness was subjected to
a close ana critical cross-examination. She
was asked ii bhe, entertained any prejudice
against having Leredi ary insanity alleged
in the defense, anu replied: ,-l cbjeot to
any unfair statements being made uj on that
subject. Perhaps lor the sake ot my children
I might dislike to h ive it t.et up, f r myself
facts can make nodiüerence. Her evidence
in chief remained unshaken, and her testi
mony produced a marked senatioii.
At the conclusion of Mrs. Wilsou's testi
mony John W. Guiteau arose from his seat
next the prisoner and asked the Court to
rule out the question relative to the witness'
father having died of ofiening of t'ie brain.
"I can not see, your Honor," continued
Guiteau, '"the occasion for dragging in peo
ple who have no blood ' relation Ith the
prisoner."
JudjeCox I think the matter irrelevant.
Guiteau Mrs. Wilson settus to be a very
bright lady, but she is opposed to having it
appear there is any insanity in the family;
that's the matter with her testimony.
Scoville here arose, trembling with excite
ment, and protested ogainst the meddling
of John A. Guiteau in the case. "He is op
posed to showing insanity in the family,"
said Scoville, and his voice was here drowned
by the prisoner, who struck his hand vio
lently on the table and shouted, "So do I.
He had better get back to Boston. He has
got no business here. Just because he hap
pens to bear the same name he thinks 1
will get a little notoriety out of this case. 1
haven't known anything about the man for
years. That's all there is about him, and I
want him to get right out of this case."
Colonel Corkhill called George C, Mayn
ard, who verified in several material points
the testimony of the preceding witness. The
Court was about to announce the usual re
cess, when John W. Guiteau arose and said:
"Your Honor, 1 greatly desire to make a
personal explanation. My father is dead "
Guiteau broke in, interrupting him: "Oh,
shut up and sit down. You have been vin
dicated." Davidge here objected to any more side
scenes, lhe prisoner had continually been
allowed to interrupt the proceedings, and
at this rate the trial would soon become a
farce.
Judge Cox I see no occasion, Mr. Gui
teau, for any explanation on your part.
Recess.
TESTIMONY KKSCMED.
After recess Frank Bartlett, of Chicago,
was called. He knew Mr. and Mrs. Scoville,
and had met the prisoner at Scoville's sura
ner residence in 1879.
"This man never saw me but once," inter
rupted Guiteau. "It has cost the Govern
ment $200 to bring this man down here. He
met me once five years ago; that's all he
knows about me. It's an outrage, Cork
hill, for you to waste the money of the Gov
ernment in this kind of way."
Witness saw Guiteau daily and never
noticed anything out of the way in his de
portment. The gentlemen there engaged in
a tub-race, ar.d Guiteau took part, when he
uptet. He was ducked by the rest of the
gentlemen, and took it in good part. Gui
teau again broke out impatiently, "What's
that got to do with what took place the 2d
of July, Corkhill? I had time to gocrasy
a hundred times since this man saw me.
That shows what stupid work is being done
by the prosecution. If you bad to pay for
this instead of the tax-payers, you would do
differently."
The witness never saw any indications of
insanity in the prisoner.
Mrs. Florence It. Bartlett, wife of the pre
vious witness, witnessed the dog incident so
often alluded to by defense, and saw noth
ing unusual in the occurrence. She thought
at the time that Mrs. Scoville was more ex
cited about it than the prisoner was, and re
membered distinctly that the prisoner, after
the dog was hurt, carried food to him, and
seemed to desire to efface any bad impres
sion it might have created. Witness de
tected no signs whatever of any mental dis
turbance in the prisoner. He was always
polite and behaved as a gentleman.
On cross-examination Scoville asked: "Do
you remember once at the table a discussion
upon some religious topic arose, and Guiteau
took part and beoamp so violent that they
all left himr '
A. Ho, I do no1.
Guiteau They all got through talking,
and so they left: that's all there was to that.
I think we have bad about enough of this
dog business.
Howard Danham, of Boston, took the
stand, but Guiteau forestalled his evidence'
by shouting: "I had dsk room with that
jam a few weeks in Boston, and that's all he
knows about it. It has cost the Government
$100 to get him here."
Witness stated that on November 18, 1879,
the prisoner secured desk room in his otttce,
and remained there nearly two months,
when, as he was behind with rent, and wit
ness did not like the style of the man, he
lequested him to surrender his key. The
prisoner told witness there was no money in
lueoiugy, anu uc niuguiug io pracuue law.
Colonel Corkhill then offered a letter written
by Guiteau to witness last June. Scoville
objected, on the ground that the burden of
proof rested with the Government. The
plea of inanity having been set up bv the
defense, the prosecution can not at this
time introduce any evidence to establish the
sanity of the prisoner. It should be intro
duced in the evidence in chief.
The Judge Well. 1 overrule the objec
tion. Scoville I desire to note an exception
generally and to all evidence of this kind.
Davidge From this time out?
Guiteau Running away back all through
the case, Judge?
A letter was read.; It was dated Iligss
tiouse, June 8, and contained a request, for
a copy of his book, "Truth," which he de
sired should be sent bim. as he was getting
out a rcvied edition., The witness stated
that in all hii connection with tue prisoner,
throuch all his relations with him and his
observations of his conduct, he never sus
pected any insanity in the prisoner.
Guiteau You thought I was badly
cracked on my book, though. Then to the
audience he added: "This man is a Metho
dist minister; that's what'." the matter with
him. I did not pay my rent, and so he did
not like me."
Witness then gave the substance of a con
versation he had had with J. W. Guiteau, in
which the latter said: ' The disgrace of
this crime is enough for the familv to bear
without endeavoring to prove heieditary in
sanity, tor there is no authenticated ca-e on
which to base it."
Guiteau (greatly excited) shouted out:
"That's the way he feels, and I desire to re
pudiate him on this business. He has never
been a brother to me in any sene, and that
isjust a ridiculous view he takes on this in
sanity business." A moment after he
shouted: "That's false. There are two of
my cousins in the Lunatic Asylum now,
and that's where I'll probably be very
soon."
John Palmer, of Saratoga Springs, testified
that Guiteau boarded a week with him, and
ran away without paying his board
Guiteau Well, I might have confessed
hat and saved the Government $100.
DEPOSIT ION OF THE PRE I DENT.
The District Attorney here sent Judsre
Cox a communication received by him from I
the FreMdent of the United States. The
Judge, after reading it, sent it to Scoville,
with the remark that the naner contained
the President's answer to his (Scoville's) in- f
lerrogaiones.
The prisonor I had sent the President a
note tlin afternoon, requesting him not io
apjear m the case, and saing I did not
want his answers to the interrogatories I
presume he sent tbem before he sot my
note.
Scoville read the answers of President
Arthur to the fmt jind second Questions.
whether he knew tin- prisoner, and how
often he had seen him. The President re
plied that he knew hlra; that, he has seen
him at least ten times and josib!y twenty
times. To the question as to whether he
had ever conversed with him. he renlied
None, excepting to. return the ordinarv
salutation of the day, and once or twice in
answer to his request to be employed in the
campaign as a Sfeaker bv the Republican
State Committee, of which 1 was Chairman.''
To the question. "What political services
had the prisoner rendered the Republican
party during the last Presidential ea ni-
paign?" the answer is. "None that I know
of." The fifth uuestvin was whether ihcro
was anything in the t-risoner's relations to
h im sei f nr to nanant nn - f
Conkling, or any other of the Republican
. . , v . . v. t.i ' 1 niui
party, socially or politically, to furnish him
with any ground for supposing he would re
ceive any political preferment. The answer
is, "No."
Tne prisoner That is a matter of opinion.
The last question was: "Di I vou ever t?i ve
him any reason to think he could have any
political or personal influence with vou?"
Th answer is: "l never did?"
Prisoner He never had occasion to.
The President add to his answers the fol
lowing: "I have been requested bv the
counsel for the defend to produce a letter
written by the prisoner since his indictment.
That letter was received by me in Octob-r
last, and was not preserved; do not recollect
its contents particularly, excepting it con
tained sme claim of his having rendered
some importaut service to the' Republican
party during the presidential camnaicn.
and an appeal for a 'jostponement of his
trial, to give him time to prepare for the de-
fortco
The prisoner That is all there was to
it.
The next witness was Rev. R. A. Mr Ar
thur, pastor of Calvary Baptist Church, New
York. As soon as he was sworn the prisoner
remarked: "I know Dr. McArthur verv
well. He is a nice, fine fellow; very
high-toned in even wav. I owe him
$95.' :
The witness began to relate how the
prisoner introduced ;hlmself and wife to
him (witness) at close of service oi.e Sun
day, and at the same time pre
ented a letter of d is minion
from the First Baptist Church,
Chicago. The prisoner stated at that time
in Chicago he had had a lucrative practice
of law, but owing to disasters following the
fire, his practice had entirely, or in a good
part, gone. Now he and his wife had come
to New York tp start life afresh. My heart
went out to him, and I kindly introduced
him and his wife to men of prominence in
society and In Church relations, at.d I know
I was of service to him. The letter which
he brought was referred, as is our custom,
to a Committee. The Chairman of that
Committee was a gentleman of very high
standing, at one time Indian Commissioner
under the United States Government, and
who took an Interest "
Here the witness was Interrupted by Sco
ville, who remarked that all this was very
interesting but entirelv irrelevant. He did
not want this entire hish-rv.
The Distilct Attorney But I do want the
whole history connected with the prisoner.
The prisoner It is all interesting and im
portant. Dr. McArthur is a very tine gen
tleman. I owe hlra 95 and I am sorry I
can't pay him now. Then, add retting the
witness, he said; "Allow me to say, Doctoi,
there is some possibility of my getting
5,000 from James Gordon Bennett for that
Herald disability matter, and I propose to
send you a check for $U5 the moment I get
it
Scoville remarked that he objected to the
witness stating the qualifications of some
uua'"" uiavumminee not snowing now
far he might g i in that history.
The prisoner Doctor McArthur is an ora
tor, as you may see by.ihe way he talks
riiauh-.l
Witness resumed his story, and told of the
prisoner and wife being received into fel
lowship of the Church, and of his wife later
asking urgently for moiiev, handing him a
promissory no'e of the prisoner for $100.
n ivMeave von Pot tDat promissory
Witness -NO; T did not think it negotia
ble and ha. e not preserved it. A laugh
During the political campaign of that fall
the prisoner was not seen at our meetings so
often, and the reason assigned by him was
(the phrase he ned), he had gone to some
degree into politics, and he expected an
office as a result of these political excite
ments. Prisoner I took some interest in Horace
Greely in 1872.
District Attorney Do you recolleot the
office he expected?
Prisoner I did not expect any office at
that time. Colonel. ;

mat was an there was in it, I was not
going to live all my life with a woman I did
not like. I had no business marrying her at
all.
The witness (ignoring the interruption) -And
about the 30th of April, 1875, he was
summoned 10 appear before the Advisory
Committee to answer to the charge of im
morality. 1 here were three counts to the
chirge. Firt, he took money which bis
wiie earned by working in a hotel in the
country, and which was remitted him to
asist in suprorting him.
Prisoner (interrupting) That is abso
lutely fale. Doctor, I never heard that
story before.
Witness (still ignoring the interruption)
And spent it in improper relations with
other women.
Prisoner (with excitement) That is ab
solutely false. If my wife told you that she
t ld a lie. The witness (continuing his nar
rative). The second count adds: "He has
been guilty by frequent acts of violation of
his marriage vow."
The pri-oner (again breaking in) I only
married that wuman on ten hours' notice,
anil that is reason enough why I could not
live with her.
Witness The third count was that as a
result those repeated acts of infidelity ho
was suffering from a vile and loathsome
di seise.
Prisoner That is false.
The witness Those charges were re
cited to the prisoner by myself, in the
nrpsnro nf tha P,imrr.ill "
The prisoner That's erroneous. I beg to
differ from you.
The Court (severely )- Keep quiet; let the
witness go on.
Witness I recited those charges to the
prisoner, and he acknowledged the truth of
every one of them. He stated as his excuse
that his wife was absent, that nature's
demand must be met, and he could not re
sist the enticements of lewd women on the
street. He was pressed to know whether he
felt a sense of guilt whether there was any
consciousness of remorse or repentance for
the past, or any promise of reform action for
the future. The Church was disposed to do
fairly. The gentlemen onjthat Committee
were gentlemen who were above anything
like unfairneness toward any person.
Prisoner in spite of Scoville's efforts to
repres him) -I remember this; I take
bark my contradiction to what the Doctor
aid, because, unon thinking it over. I find
it is correct. The men on that Committee
said they had been in the same boat them
t selves, and for that reason they felt sympa
thetic, iney thought if a man had been
unfortunately married he had a right to get
out of it.
Scoville objected to the evidence as en
tirely inadmissible, and the Court sus
tained the objection.
The prisoner (excitedly) I never bad but
one interview with him (alluding to wit
ness ). I recall it now. I was
formally excommunicated and let the
whole thing go by default because I
was in Chicago. I have been strictly virtu
ous for six or seven years. Mark that down.
You are picking my whole record from m-
tancy, and 1 say it is an outrage on decency.
iMsmciy Attorney we present this tes
timony because we want to show that what
the defense calls insanity is nethitig more
than devilish depravity.
It was with some difficulty that the ap
plause which greeted this remark could be
quelled, and the Marshal led out of the
Court room a lad particularly noisy, the
Court stating that upon any reoccurrence of
applause he would order the room
cleared. When order had been re
stored the witness resumed his testimony
and said that it never occurred to him for a
moment that the prisoner was other than
sane.
Scoville proceeded with the cross-examination,
questioning the witness more especially
as to the fact of his receiving a promissory
note for $100 from Guiteau.
The prisoner throughout the examination
on this point kept a running discussion with
the witness, counsel and Court. The Court
repeatedly ordered him to keep quiet and
allow the witness to speak, but he continued
in his denunciation of the prosecution for
its "impertinence in raking up my old
record."
Scoville also became indignant and angry
at the prisoner's outbreaks, which pre
vented him from finishing his Question, and
severs! times declared to him: "I will clear

You must be still."
You must be still.
But neither the Court
nor counsel could repress the prisoner.
When the cro-ss-examination vas closed,
the prisoner, looking up at the clock, an
nounced it was 3 o'clock and time to go
home. He also inquired "How many more
witnesses like that nave you got, Corkhill?
I think it is an outrage on the public. If
you had to pay some of that money your
self, you would go slow."

about an hour before the mold was ready to

than the jaws at the lobe of the ear. He
bent his head low and took hold of the mold,

"The last sitting was given Thursday

them on a chair, pulled his undershirts
down a short dutance, tying tha leevs
