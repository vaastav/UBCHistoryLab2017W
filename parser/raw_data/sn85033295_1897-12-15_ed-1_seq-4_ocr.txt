Dr. Miles’ Nervine
A REMEDY FOR THE
Effects of Tobacco.
THE excessive use of tobacco, especially
by young men is always injurious and
undoubtedly shortens life materially.
Mr. Ed. C. Ebsen, compositor on the Contra-
Costa News, Martinez, Cal., writes; *T have
used Dr. Miles’ Restorative Nervine and re
ceived much benefit from it. I was troubled
with nervousness, dizzy spells and sleepless
ness, caused by the use of tobacco and stim
ulants. I took Dr. Miles’ Nervine with mar
velously good results, allaying the dizziness,
quieting the nerves, and enabling me to
sleep and rest, proving in my case a very
beneficial remedy.” Dr. Miles’ Restorative
Nervine Is especially adapted to restoring
the nervous system to its normal condition
under such circumstances. It soothes, heals
and strengthens.

The Milwaukee wheat market yes
terday was steady, closing at 91c for
No. 1 Northern and 87c for No. 2.
Flour was lower for nearly all grades
except hard spring “patents.” Bar

The Juneau Independent congrat
ulates Representative Sauerhering
over the fact that he has announced
his opposition to what The Inde
pendent terms the “iniquitous, mug
wump, humbug civil service law.”
He is reported to be the only mem
ber of the Wisconsin congressional
delegation who has taken this stand.
There is a wide difference of opinion
as to the merits of the measure, but
the idea that it is considerable of a
fraud seems to be growing daily.
This from The Waukesha Freeman
applies as well to other places as to |
Waukesha county: “Brother Petti
bone, of The Oconoraowoc Republi
can, is firmly of the opinion that Wau
kesha county is not receiving a fair
share of the state’s good things—
offices, of course. When the Republi
cans of this county arrive at the
point where there is not the shadow
of a plum left—and they are there
now in fact—and will then pull to
gether for offices or war, you can just
bet they will get their share.”
No one can make the plea of too
great length for not reading Presi
dent McKinley’s message tc congress
in full. The president has set an ad
mirable example in condensing what
he has to say into a short, business
like document, easily read and un
derstood. It makes only eight or
ninecolumns in all—about one-fourth
as much as most of our presidents
have in the past devoted to their
efforts. The beginning of the mes-
sage is taken up with the currency
question and some needed reforms
suggested. A good word is spoken for
bimetallism. In regard to Cuba, the
president takes a very conservative
standpoint, and intimates that under
the new Spanish ministry matters
may be brought to a peaceful solu
tion. The annexation of Hawaii is
treated as a foregone conclusion, and
Alaska must be looked after in a
better manner. President McKinley
sees fit to incorporate the customary
praise of civil service reform, begun
by President Cleveland to please a
lot of sore-heads and idealists who
entertp/lned very visionary ideas on
this subject, but in view of the fact
that in every other respect the com
munication is a model, this little di
version may easily be overlooked.—

HOW TO FIND OUT.
Fill a bottle or common glass with
urine and let it stand twenty-four
hours; a sediment or settling indicates
an unhealthy condition of the kidneys.
When urine stains linen it is evidence
of kidney trouble. Too frequent
desire to urinate or pain in the back,
is also convincing proof that the kid
neys and bladder are out of order.
WHAT TO DO.
There is comfort in the knowledge
so often expressed, that Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root, the great kidney remedy,
fulfills every wish in relieving pain in
the back, kidneys, liver, bladder and
every part of the urinary passage.
It corrects inability to hold urine and
scalding pain in passing it, or bad
effects following use oiliquor, wine or
beer, and overcomes That unpleasant
necessity of being compelled to get up
many times in the nightto urinate. The
mild and the extraordinary effect of
Swamp Root is soon realized It
stands the highest for its wond.erful
cures of the most distressing cases. If
you need a medicine you should have
the best. Sold by druggists, price fifty
cents and one dollar. You may have
a sample bottle and pamphlet both
sent free by mail. Mention The
Watertown Republican and send your
address to Dr. Kilmer & Cos., Bingham
ton, N. Y. The proprietors of this
paper guarantee the genuineness of
this offer.
In the evening twilight of winter time,
when the fire sparkles and glows and
dances upon the hearth, there are dreams
and air castles of the future in the flames
for the young woman who sits and gazes
into them. Whether these air castles will
ever become realities, is largely a matter
of health.
No woman can hope to be a contented
wife, the mistress of a happy home and the
mother of healthy children who suffers
from weakness and disease of the delicate
organs that are distinctly feminine. All
the air castles that she builds will crumble
into dust, unless she takes measures to cor
rect the disorders from which she suffers.
Dr. Pierce’s Favorite Prescription is a posi
tive cure for all disorders of these most
sensitive organs. It makes them strong,
healthy and vigorous. It prepares a woman
for happy wifehood and healthy mother
hood. It robs maternity of its peril and
of nearly all pain. It insures children with
strong, healthy constitutions. Thousands
of women have testified to its marvelous
merits. For nursing mothers it is the best
supportive tonic.
When a dealer urges some substitute he’s
thinking of the larger profit he’ll make —
not of your welfare.
“ About six years ago my wife became afflicted
with displacement, causing inflammation and
much pain,” writes Rev. I. J. Coppedge, of Elmo.
Kaufman Cos., Texas. ‘‘She could not stand on
her feet or get in any position but what she suf
fered great bearing down pain. I got her a bot
tle of Dr. Pierce’s Favorite Prescription which
she soon found was helping her; so she kept on
until she had taken six bottles. Since taking
the last she lias not suffered a moment from
the old trouble."
More Rambusch Cases.
On Wednesday. December 1, the case of
Arthur Maldaner vs. George W. Smith came on
for trial. In 1889 Mr. Smith, who lives in Bur
n rt. gave a note and mortgage to W. T. 3am
busch for $2,00 1. Rambusch sold the note and
mortgage to Henry Maldaner, Sr., of Water
town. Smith paid the note and interest in
four payments and took Rambusch’s receipt
therefor. The last payment was made in 1 893.
Rambusch then returned to him a mutilated
note which Mr. Smith thought was the original
paper, his name being torn off. He told Smith
that he burned the mortgage. The mortgage
was'‘satisfied” upon the records in the regis
ters office. In the meantime Rambusch paid the
interest regularly to Or. Maldaner aud after
the death of Mr. Maldaner, to Mrs. Maldaner.
There was one payment of sso<> also credited on
the note held by Maldaner. The plaintiff,
Arthur Maldaner, is the son of Henry Maldan
er. The mortgage was assigned to him by the
executors of his father s estate. The action
was brought to recover the balance of $1,500
and some interest due on the note. Geo. Lines,
of Milwaukee, appeared for the plaintiff, and
Malone & Bachhuber for the defendant. Judge
Dick has the matter under consideration.
The case of Henrietta Winkelmann against
Heinrich Brickert was tried Decern oer 3. The
action was brought to recover $l,lOO alleged to
be due on a note and mortgage given by Brick
ert to "Wm. Baker and afterwards sold to Mrs.
Winkelmann, a resident of Watertown. Theo.
P. Hemmy conducted the assignment and paid
the interest annually to Mrs. Winkelman
through the Bank of Juneau. Brickert paid
the interest to Rambusch and Rambusch
turned it over to the bank. He also paid S3OO
of the principal to Mr. Rambusch and took his
receipt therefor. This Mr Rambusch failed
to turn over, and instead of owing SBOO balance,
as he supposed, he still owedsl,looon the note.
Judge Dick decided the case in favor of Mrs.
Winkelman on the ground that Rambusch
acted as the agent of Mr. Brickert and was cot
the agent of Mrs. Winkelman. Harlow Pease
appeared for Mrs. Winkelman and Malone &
Bachhuber for Brickert.
The case of Theo. P. Hemmy as administra
tor, de bonis non, of the estate of Lucinda
Cutler, deceased, against George Hawkins,
was on trial Friday, December 3. W. T. Ram
busch was the executor of the last will and
testament of Mrs. Cutler, and as such executor
he borrowed $1,500 from Mr. Hawkins upon his
note, and turned over to him a mortgage be
longing to the estate as security for the pay
ment of the note. Rambusch never turned the
money over to the estate and his bondsmen
made application to have an administrator de
bonis non appointed, and brought ar action
to compel Mr. Hawkins to satisfy the mort
gage. Malone & Bachhuber and Judge Sawyer,
of Hartford, appeared for the estate and con
tended that Rambusch could not bind the estate
by giving such a note. Mr. Pease appeared in
defense of Mr. Hawkins and maintained that
as Rambusch gave the note as executor or
administrator, the estate is liable for the pay
ment. Each side cited a long list of authori
ties and decisions in support of their position.
Judge Dick will examine them and render a
decision. —Juneau Telephone.
