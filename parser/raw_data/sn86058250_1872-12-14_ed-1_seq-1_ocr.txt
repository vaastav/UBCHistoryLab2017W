There wa a l quartette of free
and jovial pirits.in ; Burvllle, end;
John Digby wbb the acknowledged
Ifadtrtberrof. Peter Slade, aid
. Jim Lowden, end.Sam Pepper were
- his associates. They were four
young ; men, Woo and : generous,
with a 'great capacity for ;enJoy-
meat. ' On e oertain Monday eren-
lo they were assembled In j the

' VUB lDIIWWI H 'tVIU'HUU'Vciij.
At an early stage of the wassail,
Wore sense bad been submerged,
' Pttter Slade suggested that he had
I a 'complaint to make ; against ione
of the dignitaries of the town,; and
V. thereupon he opened " the vials 'of
Itle . denunciation opon . Parson
Meekly, tbe old clergyman "of the
1 pUCft ' . - '
Ae near as I can find out,' he
1 said, the parson just about -called
us by name, and held us up asr a
jtet ot grsceless scamps. ' ! j
f , "Not quite so bad as that,' said
'John Digby. 'He did certainly al-
lude to us very plainly;' Lnt; the
worst he brongbt against. n was,-
that we wero . prostUuttug t noble
powers and opportunities to baao
and sinful purposes. Bather flaU
tering, I thought especially tbe
'Flattering with; a vsngesnee,'
growled Tom ' Lowdeon 'What
business Is it of his!' ; . ;
'Aye,' chimed Sam Pepper, 'what
' business is it of bis? snd then look
at tbe hullabaloo they're making
about this foreign mission busi
' ness. It was la ' cbnneotion with
that that Larson Bleakly attacked
us. They'd better look at home.
; I think we have suffering enough
under our very noses that had bet"'
. ter be looked out for first.' , . f .
t 'Thafs so,' cried Sladtf. ','1 say,
'charity begins at home.' What
do you aay John?' . 1
John Digby had listened atten
r tively, and during tbe conversation .
' he had turned bis glass bottom op-
ward upon the table. K '
Tbere may be truth in what you
V. say,', he slowly and thoughtfully
replied ; 'but people who. live in
glass . houses shouldn't ,r throw
' stones. " We may object $o for.
' Bisbing onr money for these lor
:: sign missions upon the plea that
charity begins at home, and ' all
that; but the question may come
uubeck what have w done for this
f charity at home? What have i
done toward alleviating '"the dis
tresses of the poor of our own
town? And if we haven't done
anything in that direction- if we
don't open our hands in charity at
' all what right have we to say, in
what direction others should aim
their good works?'
Blank were the looks that greet
: ed this speech. ,' Tbe trio of listen
ers were taken aback. They -had
not expected this from their lead-
er. ' :''.:7i "'
; , 'Now look here boys, eontinucd
John Digby, pushing his inverted
glass away to the centre,, of the
table and leaving it- there, I do n't
like this ' overhawling that Parson
Meekly gave as any better than
you do, and 1 propose to shut him
np.' . ....
: 'Hi-yab!' shouted Sam. Pepper.
That's the talk. I'm with you.'
" 'Are you sure you've got the
courage, Sam?' '
'Yes sir!' -
Count me in, said Tom.'
And we,' added Peter.' 'Let's
I shut the' old fellow up. ., What's
the programme, Jack ?' -7
'Well,' answered Digby, soberly,
'I have planned that we . will take
tbe wind out of Parson Meekly'
sails ' by establishing a Reform
- Club of our own, and starting ! a
. Missionary Society on thw same
. basis.' ' :,c'-:
' 'Eh.' v,v ".. " .V-V:7v
'Look ye boys, people besides
the person are talking pretty bard
. about ns, and we will shut them
up in a lump. I'd like to astonish
'eta. I'd like to bit back in the
most effective way ... I'd like
to make 'em take back track here
,. in Burville in their own .business.'
His hearers were interested, and
. listened eagerly. ! ; : i
What ie it?-Tell ns how it is to
bs done?' they asked. .. I "
Have you got the courage to do
it?' v..,, ; ,,
. 'We'll follow you,' said Peter
Slade. - ; U
Honor bright?'
Yes.'
Then listen.'
Hold on,' cried Sam. Pepper.
Let's nil up berore you com-
mense.' :s ? . k t. i f. u - -"
1 'Not. with old Lushton's ; Tom
and Jerry,' returned Jack. 'We
shall want the cost - of it for an
other purjwse. ' Turo jour glasses
bottom up for tbe present. There
that's a eo. Now listen. e
are in the habit of meeting hero at
tbe tavern thiee evenings in the
week; and our expenses for liquor
and cigars are at least two dollars
an evening; aren't they?' i vt'.J
This was admitted by a nod
'And in addition to this I spend
at least a dollar a week more each
week for beer and tobacco on my
own book. How is it with yon?'
Tbe others acknowledged that a
dollar a week was little enough. .
Thus,' resumed John Digby
we have tea dollars a week a the
result of Our combined and indi
vidual expenditure for rum and to
bacco. ' I, far one, think I could
manage to live through the rest of
the winter without any more of it;
and for the sake of the experiment
I would be willing to put ray share
of that ten dollars a week to a
charitable use. Here it is in the
beginning of Decembe-, and the '
winter has opened hard. There
are ' poor families not far away
which we can bless with our sym
pathy and our help. 1 We might
organize a benevolent society, or
a missionary society, on our own
hook. Do you begin to under
stand?' " They understood him perfectly;
and, since he ' would lead them,
they were ready to follow. ' In
fact, they rather liked the, idea.
There was a charm of novelty and
originality about it, that captivated
them. It would be fun to pur
chase flour, and meat, and tea and
sugar, and fuel, abd go around and
assist the poor and needy." They
were young mea, ' fall of life and
good feeling, and had caroused
only because' of the fun of the
thing. Here wa promise of fun
In another direction, .and they
would go for it.
The matter . was discussed, and
finally settled. They would make
a square week of it at tbe begin
ning. .
During the week,' said Jack, 'we
will look up the cases of destitu
poor bouse, I tell you; it brought
the tears to my eyes f: f
And so the reports were made.
and then they planned how they
could best use their ten dollars. It
seemed like a drop in the bucket
when set against all the suffering
and want - they had found; but it
would do something.
Un that Saturday evening the
Widow Bashlot bent over the bed ;
... - i it
of her sick child with weeping and
with wails of anguish. The howl
ing blast piped without and the
keen frost nipped within. She
suffered because sho had net yet
brought herself to beg. -For her
self, she would rather die than he
come a pauper; but for her child
Oh! God have 'mercy oavf: f?
A wailinar cry like this Lad burst
from her lips, when the tramp of
feet at her door attracted her at
tention, and presently a gentle rap
followed. She answered the sum
mons, and found four young men
upon the stoop. She knew them
well, for .they ' had been school
mates with her son who baa gone
away , to sea and never returned
And they came into the house,and
they brought with them wood and
provisions; and they piled up the
fuel upon the hearth until the
bright flame leaped and roared ;and
the 6ick child stretched out its
wasted arms to embrace the genial
warmth. And they brought forth
bread, and tea, and sugar, and but
ter, and cheese.
All right,' said Sam Pepper, who
regarded, these as his especial
charges, in answer to the widow's
ejaculations of amazement. 'We
are John Digby'a Beform Club;
and we are going into tbe mission-
ary work; and such folks as you
are we want to convert want to
convert you from suffering to com
fort if we can, So keep up a good
heart, and let us do for you what
your own Willie would have done
it he had lived. It '11 be comfort
for us. 'We'll call often. You
shan't want if we can help it.'
The widow's sobbing, 1 bursting
return of gratitude, and her eager,
heart-sent prayer of blessing can
not be reproduced by tongue or
pen. When the young men had
reached the highway Sam Pepper
burst forth:
'Boys, as true as. Heaven, I
wouldn't exchange the blessing Of
that poor widow's heart for all the
joy that ever came in the old way
at the tavern . There's something
more than fun in this.', '. -'
, And his companions agreed with
him. ,, " . : ' : - "
" In another part of the town, on
the outskirts of the village, in a
poor, thatched hut, lived Ben Dris
coll snd his wife Sally. In other
years they had been well and hap
nv. and though never forehanded,
yet they bad not known want un
til old ase and sickness had ds-
such enjoyment as they had never
known before. 4 7 ; : :
During - the aucceeding - week
three new members were added to
the club -men who were willicg
to cut off expense for rum and to
bacco and devote tbe : proceeds to
the relief of the poor and distressed
of the town. 1
And ere lonst Disbv's Reform
Club became a noted institution la
the town; The projectors thereof
could hardly credit the evidence of
their own senses in contemplating
the results of three months' labor.
TwoT and twenty 7 member si had
joined,' and the -fund for relief
amounted to almost forty dollars a
week, as each man wis pledged to
pay in weekly the exact sum his
spirits and tobacco had cost him.
If he continued to ose tobacco be
took a lower place in the com-
oanv. and the use of spirits as a
beverage was sufficient cause for
expulsion. When the people aaw
the great good that was being done,
they were anxious to give their
aid, snd be counted in with the
happy crew; but the laws of the
club were fixed, no money could
come to its fund except such as had
been saved by the donor from the
conquest of some evil habit, or the.
cutting off of some useloss luxury.
It was a bright Sabbath in spring
time. - and it had been told that
Parson Meekly was going to preach
a sermon upon Digby's Reform
Club, and the old meeting-house
was filled to overflowing, r - The
clergyman read bis text from St
John's Gospel "(Jan there any
good thing come out of Nazareth?
Come and see." And when he had
told the story of Digby's Clubhand
pictured tbe good results of Us
labors, he proclaimed to all '-Go
ye, and do lUewise." -
Once John Digby and bis com
patriots had fancied that it would
be a proud moment when they bad
brought the old clergyman to re
cognize the worth ot their labors
but the blessings of those upon
whom their bounty had fallen had
made such sweet music in their
ears, and the satisfaction of duties
truly done had dropped so sooth
ingly upon their souls, that -they
found no room for that baser pride
which they had aforetime anticipa
ted." '.' :) 7':

upon the passage of tbe bill provid
ing for the payment of the1 out
standing canal bonds, stood yeas,
30; nays, 18. Messrs. Chapman,
Republican, and Fuller, Democrat,
were absent. Every ' Republican

The sad ovents surrounding the
last days of the veteran editor and
politician, lent an added gloom to
the ceremonial of yesterday, but
this is not the time or place to al
lude to these. That he had great
faults as well as great virtues none
will deny; that the former became
more conspicuous toward the close
of his life was the combination of
adverse circumstances rather than
of his own volition. But even in tbe
very shadow of the somber scenes',
of the last twenty-four hours,
whicti witnessed "the last of earth"
to Horace Greeley, it is no less
just to him than to those who
mourn bis loss to declare that his
was a dual character, and that his '
editorial life and his political life ,
were separate existences divided
by a great gulf. , In the one his
genius ebons forth triumphant,
and in his true vocation as writer
and journalist he had no peer; in
tbe other his raiud and virtues
were clouded, his preceptions , of
right were overcome by ambition,
and he fell. It will be a consol
ing reflection to his friends that
history cannot fail to make this
distinction, and thus do him just
ice. His supreme rank as an edi
tor no one can dispute. ' Of this he
leaves a monument in the great
journal founded by himself, alone
and almost unaided, and brought
through thirty years of unremit
ting toil, to a station of great pros
perity and wide influence. As a

And Uncle Ben, and his wife
were aroused from their stupor of
chill and hunger by the tramp of
feet and the hum of voices; and
very shortly the door of tbeir cabin
was opened, and John Digby and
his ' companions entered. A fire
speedily' blazed upon tbe ' hearth,

Horace Greeley was born in Am
