MONDAY December 14. 1908
THEODORE W. NOTES Editor
Entered a* *ecrn<i-cla?4 mail matter at the pott
office at Washington. D. C.
THE STAB nas a regular and permanent
Family Circulation much mora
than the combined circulation of the
other Washington dalllea. As a Hewi
and Advertising Medium It has no
competitor.
t?Tn order to avoid delays on account
of personal absence letters to THE
STAB should not be addressed to any
Individual connected with the office, but
simply to TSE STAB, or to the Editorial
or Business Department, according to
tenor or purpose.
Brownsville Again.
The Brownsville special message of the
President reports to the Senate in substance
that a confession of guilt has been
secured from Boyd Conyers, a soldier of
B Troop, which implicates in the crime
several other soldiers who are named.
The President believes that all of the
discharged colored soldiers had knowledge
of uhe criminals and concealed this knowledge.
In respect to them he says:
"I believe we can afford to reinstate
any of these men who now truthfully tell
what has happened, cive all the aid they
can to fix the responsibility upon those
who are really guilty and show that they
themselves had no guilty knowledge beforehand
and were in no way Implicated
in the affair, save by having knowledge
of it afterward and failing and refusing
to divulge it. * * I recommend that a
law be passed allowing the Secretary or
War to reinstate any of these
soldiers whom he, after careful examination,
finds to have been Innocent and
whom he finds to have done all in his
power to help bring to Justice the guilty."
In other words the President suggests
that those soldiers who will now confess
that they were accessories after the fact
to the Brownsville murder, and were
perjurers in their previous denials of
guilty knowledge, and will, turning state's
evidence, swear to the guilt of those whom
they designate as the actual murderers,
should be reinstated in the United States
Army.
This procedure would he as unfair to
the public as the original wholesale discharge
without honor was unfair to an
unknown percentage of the soldiers.
The President claims to have put his
hand upon the actual Brownsville murderers.
Discharge from the army is not
sufficient punishment for these men. When
duly convicted, they should suffer the extreme
penalties of the law.
No soldier who by proof or confession
is shown to be a perjurer and accessory
to murder should be reinstated in the
United States Army. The penitentiary is
for such men.
The only negro soldiers who should be
ir-Mi.-uncu are tnose against whom there
Is no proof either of participation in murder
or of perjury to shield murderers. But
the burden is not upon these men to prove
their innocence, theoretically a legal impossibility.
To justify their punishment
in any way their guilt should be demonstrated
in accordance with law and not
merely by executive proclamation.
The President contends that this is not
a case of separating the Innocent from the
guilty, but of separating the less guilty
from those whose guilt is heinous. If
Congress finds no colored soldiers in respect
to whom the presumption of innocence
is not overthrown or shaken by evidence,
there should be no reinstatements.
If, however, Congress finds one soldier
who swears to bis absence of guilt both as
principal or accessory and against whom
there is no evidence or accusation whaisoever,
he should be reinstated, and in justice
the reinstatement should take effect
from the date of bis discharge.
The only issue is as to the number of
such men whose discharge was an injustice.
The President thinks there are none
oi tneni. umers mina tnai mere are
many of them; others still that there
are a few of them. Tlife exact number
is to be determined. It should not be
left to the ascertainment of the exc ?utive,
who is committed to the theory that
the only acceptable evidence of Innocence
ox the heinous crime is confession of guilt
of a less grade.
Nord Alexis.
Castro Is well supplied with money, and
now it is said Nord Alexis is. This is an
important point. Kings and presidents
and other great folk In exile should support
a sort of state. They should never
become a public charge. If their checks
are good at the bank they may live where
they please, and change residences as
often as they please. But a ruler out of
a job who while with a Job failed to provide
for damp weather Is not an object
either of interest or admiration. And as
for recovering such a Job once lost, It Is
money that makes that mare, as the
commonest nag, go.
Offers that are reaching Mr. Cortelyou
from financial institutions Indicate that
the salary of a cabinet officer under the
next administration would not be a great
inducement.
Now the csar finds art treasures missing
to the extent of over a million dollars.
The Russian grafter has no respect
for anything.
Bryan says that free silver would have
averted last year's panic. This sounds
like beginning life anew.
The Senate and the Cabinet.
Mr. Knox disappoints those Pennsylvania
politicians who had their eyes fixed
longingly on his senatorial shoes by announcing
that no offer of a cabinet place
has been made to him. that he expects
none, and that he is entirely satisfied
where he is. He should remain where he
is. Judge Taft seeks advisers of the first
quality, and Mr. Knox would fill any
chair at the cabinet table with distinction.
But the administration will need advisers
In Congress as well, and in the Semite
Mr. Knox will be one of the ablest of
these
This same argument applies to Mr.
Bodge, whose name also has been canvassed
in connection with the secretaryship
of state. He is well placed and well
satisfied In the Senate, and will be a
great aid to the new administration there,
as he has been to the expiring administration
The Senate rather tha^i the cabinet
would appear to be the better field of usefulness
for him.
Mr. Cleveland's first mistake as a national
leader, as many persons believe,
was in going to the Senate for three members
of his first cabinet. His Judgment
as to the men was excellent. They had
large credit with the country, and been
long in office. Mr. Bayard was a little
stately for everyday wear, but an able
man Mr. Lamar lacked Industry, but
had been for years one of his party's best
advisers in the Senate. Mr. Garland was
regarded as a lawyer of the first class,
and at the time of his appointment as
Attorney General was almost as much
admired as either Mr. Bayard or Mr.
Lamar.
And yet the beginning ef an admin
istration which was certain to need stout
and able champions in Congress, Mr.
Cleveland transferred these three men
from a field where they had made entirely
good to one where they would be
beginners. In the opinion of some eminent
democrats of that day he would have
done better had he left tihe Senate entirely
out of his cabinet calculations and
sought members for his official family
elsewhere. In that way he would have
enjoyed the services of Messrs. Bayard,
Lamar and Garland where they were already
wielding influence, and added to his
own and the party's strength by calling
Uiree men of a high class from private
life into action. ?
Mr. Knox and Mr. Lodge belong to
what may be called the "younger set" in
.the Senate. Mr. Lodge, it is true, is getting
to be a veteran in point of service,
but, as men are reckoned in politics, he
is still a young man, and capable of a
good deal of hard work. He is still In
the class to be designated for action.
The republicans should not part with any
of their strong men in that body. They I
will need them all, and more, in the bat-1
ties of the next half dozen years. And
outside of the Senate Judge Taft may
hope to find men equal to his own and
the country's demands. The republican
party is rich in able and qualified men,
who on the score of caoinet service are
j wiilin'.
.Tndtre Taft and the Canal.
: Judge Taft is so much interested in tne
I situation on the Canal Zone lie has clej
cided to make another journey to the
j isthmus. lie may go, it is said, early in
I the new year, taking a government ship.
! Since he was last tthere a good deal of
work has been done, and he wants to
begin as President with all the information
it is possible to gather at first hand
about the great enterprise for use in his
recommendations to Congress.
This interest is altogether justified.
The chances are that Judge Taft will remain
in the Wihite House eight years. He
is going into office with the hearty support
of his own party and the thorough
good will of the other. So far in his life,
failure has not been written against his
name. He has a clear purpose in view, a
full comprehension of ttfie duties of his
great place, and everybody expects htm
to succeed. The chances are ten to one
that he will succeed, and that the country
will decide that one good term deserves
another.
Now this canal problem will, so to say,
"last" Judge Taft his probable two terms
In the presidency. The tariff will soon
be disposed of, and if the new law is
well drawn it should work well, with a
few minor changes now and then, for at
least eight years. Nothing in the trust
problem or the railroad problem appears
to threaten protracted difficulties on those
scores. Much remains to be done, but the
next two Congresses should be able to
ottoni^ fA If oil
UVlViiU I.V 4 L Hill
A survey of other matters is equally assuring.
Nobody expects any change in
the Philippine problem except that of a
continued advance of the interests of the
islands under the American sovereignty.
According to the views of both Mr. Roosevelt
and Judge Taft, it will be useless to
discuss independence for the Filipinos
for at least a generation. Cuba will soon
be on trial again, but even should her
second attempt to stand alone fail, she
should present no protractedly vexed
question to us. She must have orderly
government, and if she is unable to provide
it for herself it will be our duty, and
easily within our ability, to provide it for
her.
But the canal problem will abide. It
will be with Judge Taft at the beginning.
and probably at the end, of his probable
eight years in office. Its importance
will increase right along. As it nears
completion it will appeal more and more
to the attention of the world, and call for
new adjustments of world matters; and
should the final touches be administered
and ships pass through from ocean to
ocean before Judge Taft leaves the White
House, he will be, as the head of this nation,
the most conspicuous and interesiing
public figure on top of ground.
There is every reason, therefore, why
Judge Taft should be giving the canal a
large place in his thoughts and program.
In the sense described it is the biggest
thing he has on hand, or is likely to have,
and he cannot inform himself, or keep
himself informed, too thoroughly as to all
of its changing and growing phases.
William T. Belt.
Washington will miss the figure of Chief
Belt hurrying through the streets to answer
the alarm of fire. For forty-two
years he had been attached to the service,
and for five years he was at its head.
He had thus devoted his life to the work
of saving property from the flames, and
no fire chief stood higher in the esteem
of the members of his community than
he. The news of his death came without
warning. Friday night he was on duty
at a factory fire that was fought with
skill and confined to the place of origin.
Thus he died In service, in full vigor ana
at the height of his usefulness to the
Capital city. It Is regrettable that he did
not live to see the adoption of his recommendation
for a high-pressure tire service
in Washington. He was a graduate of
the old hand-pump days. In his youth
he had "run with the engine" of his
favorite company, and he had seen the
development of the steamer and the water
tower. Of a progressive nature, Mr. Belt
as chief advocated the adoption here of the
latest means of Are extinguishment, and
It would have been gratifying If he could
have witnessed the triumph of the most
advanced ideas on the subject of affording
protection to the business district. Now
that he has answered his last call to
duty, he will be borne in grateful memory
by the District, of which he was a native
and which he served effectively and
bravely in a capacity which called for
the highest qualities.
A trip to Europe is a good thing for
a South American president when the
local atmosphere becomes too hot for
comfort.

It was particularly hard lines for Tom
L. Johnson to discover he was broke just
before Christmas.
Fortunately the destruction of timber
has not yet reached a point where it can
interfere with the Christmas tree supply.
Santa Claus Letters.
"Santa Claus letters" t.re flying through
the mails, pathetic, comical little missives,
written in the crabbed, scrawly
characters of childhood, some on the fine
stationery from tnamma'a writing desk,
some on scraps. Some of them ask for
guns and talking dolls and choo-choo cars
that run on tracks, and games and animals
that bleat and moo and growl and
bark. Others ask for coats and shoes,
for stockings and perhaps for food. For
the child's faith in the good old man of
the north who drives reindeer and descends
chimneys is so deeply fixed that
he is looked to for everything desired
from a toy to the necessities of life.
Fortunate are the parents who, with
the means to gratify the desires of their
children, are enabled to gain possession
of these sincere expressions in season.
Even more fortunate is the parent who
contrives to gratify the hopes of the
little ones without distorting their sense
of proportion, or dulling their appreciation
of home bounties. A sad spectacle is
that of the child who has been satiated
with gifts, until unable to enjoy anything.
And at the other end of the social line
is the child who has no toys, to whom
an old, discarded, perhaps broken, plaything
would prove an inestimable blessing"
on Christmas morning.
Judicious giving is more necessary in
the case of the children than in that of
the grown-ups. The child should be
taught to regard tho Christmas spirit
reverently, and carefully held aloof from
ail thought of the season merely as a
time when things are given to it. Perhaps
those who have little enjoy that
little more than those who have much.
Certainly the "Santa Claus letters" that
come all soiled and rumpled and scrawled
from the homes of the poor are the surest
possible guides for those who seek to
I make the day glad for others.

SHOOTING STARS.
BY PHILANDER JOHNSON.
Careful Analysis.
"I don't believe that man is nearly as
indignant as his remarks would seem to
indicate," said Senator Sorghum.
. "Why, he seems to have run the gamut
of Invective."
"That's just it. No man who was really
in any such state of excitement would
stop to hunt up long words In the
thesaurus."

"You say you never toftched a penny
that you did not actually earn!" said the
investigator.
"That," replied Mr. Dustin Stax, "is
precisely what I said. And I repeat 1L
I have numerous people in my employ
whose duty it is to receive all the small
change."
A Letter to Santa Claus.
Never mind the chimney
When you come, oh generous soul;
Just drop around the basement way
And leave a ton of coal.
An Affront to Custom.
"Why do you talk so much of that
writer's originality? His style is not particularly
audacious."
"That's true. But he once mentioned a
man who went hunting without referring
to him as 'a mighty Nimrod.' "
An Opinion Ventured.
"Do you believe that ignorance is ever
bliss?" said the erudite girl.
"I never studied the question." answered
Miss Cayenne. "But I should say that a
young person who doesn't know the difference
between holly and mistletoe would
have a decided advantage of a Christmas
party."

Spoilsmen in the House.
From the New York Times.
Courtesy is a nice thing undoubtedly
in the intercourse of congressmen, but
truth is still more important. When Mr.
Gillett of Massachusetts, advocating the
application of the merit system to the
census employes, used the word "spoilsmen,"
he was instantly accused of Impoliteness
toward his fellow-members. !
He made proper explanation, but It remains
true that the "spoilsmen" have I
had their way through the kind aid of
the congressmen, a distinction with a
shadowy difference. The miserable bribe
of a few appointments in each congressional
district sufficed to induce the ma- j
jority to betray the real interests, the
very large and important interests, of
the whole country. In a matter of not
only national but international concern
the still, small voice of duty was silenced
by the grunt of insatiable appetite.
Louisi&nians in Washington.
From the New Orleans Times-Democrat.
In the several conferences and conventions
being held in Washington this week
for the purpose of bringing important
public questions under consideration
prominently before Congress, L/Oulsiana

and city sent large delegations to these
conventions. Including some of their
ablest and most representative citizens.
Kleptomania?Shoplifting.
From the Rochester Herald.
This is the season of the year when
the police power is hard put to distinguish
between kleptomania and plain
stealing. However, by observing the texture
of her clothes, they can tell.
