PITTSBURG. TUESDAY. DEa 3. 1883.
A CHANCE POE REFORM.
Congress opened its session yesterday in
ths usual stereotyoed manner. The pro
ceedings consisted wholly of the work of or
ganizing, and there were no contests. Tet
the whole day was taken up with the work,
and the President's message did not reach
TMs i th usual stvle of doing business
in Congress at present Yet the nation
would have been glad to perceive some inui
cation of vigor and promptness in the open
ing of the present body. For two years the
Congressional vice, apart from the inevitable
mil nmninresent partisan fight has been
dawdling. "With important legislation press
ing it has simply fooled away time ana iei.
the business undone. If the opening of the
new Congress could have shown a disposi
tion to get to work more promptly it would
have given hopes for an improvement on the
public usetulncss of Congress
The burden, in this Congress, is upon the
Republicans; and they should understand
that if they do not establish a prompt im
provement in the matter of attending to busi
ness, it will be concluded by the people that
the vice of legislative dawdling is as bad in
one party as in another.
PARTIES AND PRAYER.
The inability of politicians to see beyond
the partisan rule of distributing the patron
age of their friends was rather unpleasantly
illustrated by the action of the House Re
publican caucus with regard to the selection
of a chaplain. Although one ot the most
radical Republicans in the House, pleaded
for leaving the chaplaincy ont of the list of
partisan patronage, in order that Rev. W.
H. ilillbnrn, the blind clergyman, might
be undisturbed, the Republicans insisted on
making the business of prating for the
House a partisan matter. Supposing this
action to be based on the usual spoils argu
ment, that a party cannot be expected to
succeed unless the administration of the
offices is in the hands of its friends, it reveals
a theory of prayer to the effect that if a
Democrat sbonld be permitted to discharge
the duty, he might bring the Republicans
to disaster. That view presents a remark
able degree of faith in prayer, although not
a very clear understanding of its merits.
FREE BRIDGES AND THE COUNTY.
The proposition to call upon the county to
furnish Iree bridges over the rivers within
the city limits is reported to be meeting with
a good deal of favor among the farmers who
live to the north and sou'b. of Pittsburg,
and who have to pay toll in order to get to
"the city. To this class the saving in tolls
would more than balance the increase in
taxation. The non-bridce-crossing agricul
turists to the east of the city have not yet
been heard from; but may probably make
their opinions known when the proposition
for the county purchase of the bridges takes
definite shape,
There is a good deal of force in the argu
ment that as the two cities have paid the
greater part of the taxation required to keep
up the bridges in the rural districts, the
county expenditure should be extended to
the bridges in the cities. It is not meant
by this argument that the cities gained no
advantage by the building of rural bridges;
but, on the other hand it is equally trne
that the rural districts will share in the
gain from free bridges over the rivers. It is
true, also, that an annual expenditure of
550,000 for rural bridges is a very
different thing from an expenditure ot six
to ten times the amount for city bridges;
but when we remember that the greater part
of the increased expenditure will be borne
by the city taxpayers, the account between
city and country is left about even.
Whatever p'an is finally adopted, the dis
cussion of the Eubject is steadily opening
the way to the adoption of a settled policy
which will eventually secure the abolition
of toll bridges.
EASTERN PARKS AND HENRY GEORGE.
We observe in au esteemed cotemporary
the statement that within four miles of a
Connecticut town, there are twenty-seven
farms that can be bought for "half the value
of the land with the buildings thrown in,"
which is alleged to be destructive of the
Benry George theory. The statement of
the valnc is redolent of a Hibernian origin,
as the value of land, like that of other
things, is generally what it will bring. But
the fact that farms throughout the Bast are
being deserted, certainly weakens the force
of Mr. George's argument that the evils of
tiA the day are founded upon an alleged mo-
"oiopoly of lands. That the present state of
affairs indicates something altogether wrong
is clear enough; but if the phenomena are
properly studied they will be likely to show
rf'thst they rise from abuses of transportation.
y and are not to be remedied by piling more
taxes on the land that is being abandoned.
A NATIONAL PROJECT.
The advocacy of the project of irrigation
to reclaim the arid lands of the "West at
the expense of the general Government,
which has been undertaken by Mr. Joseph
ZNimrno, evokes from the Philadelphia
, Times a rather ill-tempered characteriza-
tion of Mr. Nimmo as "another surplus
spender."
. UMr-Himmo never commits himself to
anything worse than the expenditure of
public money to turn a vast and useless ter
ritory into actual wealth, he will have a
Terygood record. Of course a wholesale
spending of national funds for irrigating
all the arid land at once, is not to he ap
proved; but there could hardly be a wiser
use of the public fuads than experiments on
a sufficiently large scale to determine exactly
what may be done by irrigation. If the ex
periments prove that irrigation can convert
l,-,a desert nearly twice as large as the original
- ' thirteen States into a fertile territory, it
. wonld be hard to find a better investment
f'JLox a liberal share of the surplus than to
? V. . tfiaf iint.wr.mwi ftf tliA .4imi1

r'wealth.
The objection to the proposition advanced
by the Timet it that perhaps some of the
booming new States trill be willing to irri
gate their arid land for themselves. But a
State that is made up of arid land can
hardly be expected to boom, and the amount
of money which can Je raised by taxation on
such land could not be expected to yield
very much for improvements of that charac
ter, even if the coyotes and Digger Indians'
who make up the population of these terri
tories, were willing to vote the appropria
tions. It is difficult to imagine any expenditure
of more national character than the recla
mation of a territory big enough to cut up
into half a dozen States. It is certainly
clear that "such work is much more
likely to yield broad national Jesuits than
the expenditure of millions to dig up an in
convenient island in the harbor of Philadel

The prosperity and growth ot the State of
Allegheny, and of the two great cities within
it, are manifesting themselves in the cry
which comes from all sides for many reforms
and improvements. "Wonderful changes
for the better in the matter of rapid transit
have been made.
"Within little more than a year the two
principal lines of street cars have exchanged
horses for cables as motive power, a third
important line is shortly to follow suit; and
there is still a constant demancLfor the en
largement of these privileges. Allegheny,
which has too long been held away from
Pittsburg by inadequate means of transit
and bridges of obsolete fashion, is determined
to suffer no longer. The electric street rail
road, well under way, a cable line or electric
road in place of the horses which stroll be
tween Manchester and Pittsburg, and two
or three new bridges of the best modern type
will much improve that lack. The suburbs
of Allegheny, following that city's ex
ample, are agitating in dead earnest
for new avenues and rapid means
of inter-communication, and already the
electric road which is to bring Bellevue,
by means of the new California avenne,
within easy reach of Allegheny is assured.
In other directions the same desire for the
conveniences of travel which modern science
has put within our reach is being mani
fested in a very practical way. A great
many of these improvements were due years
ago, but it is satisfactory to know that they
are to be had for certain now.
Another symptom of the same awakening
is to be found on the Southside. They have
discovered there that it is time to compel
the railroads to give human beings, great
and small, a chance of using their own
streets without incurring peril to life and
limb every hundred yards or so. And the
necessity of making passage from one part
of the city to the other free has also been
brought into such prominence as will make
any further postponement of this important
question very difficult
It is a general liveliness of the public
spirit which is being manifested all over the
community. Already it has accomplished
mncb. The beautiful Schenley Park is one
result "Who knows but that the Federal
property in Lawrenceville may not, as sug
gested once more by Mr. E. M. Bigelow
in The Dispatch on Sunday, be procured
from Congress as another breathing place.
"When the great body of a city's inhab
itants work together for the public good
there is no telling how beneficent and grand
the results may be.
THE GROWTH OF EXPENDITURES.
The increase of aopropriations for the
next fiscal year, as foreshadowed by Secre
tary "Windom's estimates, indicates the
steadv tendency toward enlargement of
Government expenditure that has been
going on for some years.
Seventeen million dollars may not be a
very large increase for a great and wealthy
nation like this. Bnt when it is remem
bored that the appropriations on which this
increase is based were the largest on record
except for war expenditures, and showed an
increase of about 5100,000,000 over the ap
propriations four years previous, it is a per
tinent question whether the tendency toward
increased expenditure has not gone far
enough.
The United States has no necessity for
meanness in its, expenditures; but at the
same time extravagance with the public
money is a vice against which there is the
greater need to guard.
CIVILIZATION AND SAVAGERY.
A remarkably frank statement of what is
after all a rather widely held view by a cer
tain part of civilization is .made by the St
Bonis Globe-Democrat, to the effect that the
only hope of redeeming Central Africa from
barbarism "lies in a process of gradual ex
termination. There is no room to hope for
the civilization of such a people, and it is
useless to expend time and money in efforts
to bring about such a result"
This is a practical assertion of the prin
ciple that the mission of civilization is to
kill off the savage owners of otherwise un
occupied territory and then to enter in and
take their possessions. According to that
view the civilized world should support the
Arab slave traders, for they are depopu
lating Africa about as steadily as can be
done. Perhaps the great work of civiliza
tion might be done more scientifically. An
international congress might offer a prize
for the discovery of some method of quietly
killing off the Africans, as it was proposed
to kill off the Australian rabbits. "When
this great scientific operation had been com
pleted, the Christianity of the land could
move in and occupy the wilds of Africa
until some more advanced and scientific
race was able to come and kill them off
This maybe civilization; bnt after look
ing it all over, it would be interesting to
have the esteemed Globe-Democrat inform
us in what respect it is better than sav
agery. It is gratifying to Fee that the disastrous
succession ot fires elsewhere has stirred up the
Pittsburg authorities to extraordinary meas
ures for the prevention ot similar destruction
in this town. If the insurance companies will
now back this up by a; rigid inspection of in
sored premises and insistence upon the owners
clearing away all dangerous rubbish, the ap
prehensions will be measurably dispelled. The
pnee ot safety for insured property and ot
profits for the insurers is eternal vigilance.

THE TOPICAL' TALKER.
What a Single Energetle Spinster Did for
a Kearbr Town She Built a Church and
Collected Tin Cans for the Bell That
Bcll' Awful Tone.
One energetic woman can accomplish a good
deal, but I never heard of one lone spinster in
moderate circumstances building a church, al
most with her own bands and entirely by her
own endeavors. Tet that is exactly what oc
curred in a little town that may almost bo
called a suburb of Pittsburg not more than fivo
years ago.
It was the upshot of a church quarrel, I be
lieve, this church building. The energetic spin
ster I've spoken of left the -church she had be
longed to for years and started out to build an
other one for herself and her friends in the
controversy to worship in. Leaving her sister
to look after the house they were two spin
sters living alone she went out to raise money
for her new church. She obtained a start from
the church erection fund ot the Presbyterian
chureh, and she followed this up by getting
donations from all the churches of that sect in
Plttsbnrg and its neighborhood. She made
a house to house canvass in many places, often
obtaining goods and building material of ono
sort and another whero she could not get
money. For instance, she actually carried
home as many boards as her arms would hold
from a sawmill ono day, and she was known in
those days to pick np a loose brick wherever
sho saw it What help sne bad from those
who sympathized with her canse did not
amount to much. A not over-friendly ob
server of her labor tells me that there is np
donbt but that that church rose under the im
pulse of one woman's indomitable will, cour
age and devotion.
It is a structure of a modest sort and you
can see it for yourself any day you choose.
Any doubting Thomas who refuses to credit
the story can have the name of tho woman and
the town where tho church stands of mo for
the asking.
But when the church was completed, the roof
on, and a minister more or less regularly en
gaged to preach from its unostentatious pulpit
was the founder, the builder, the inspiring
spirit of tho sanctuary satisfied? Not she.
She wanted a bell; a bell to summon tho little
floek to their spiritual fold. AU the money she
had raised was gone. Not a cent was in the
young church's treasury. She was not to bo
daunted or discouraged. She went to a bell
foundry in Pittsburg and told someone there of
the plight she was In. Whether for a joke or
because he thought It a handy way to get rid of
an importunate woman, the founder tqjd her
that if sho would collect a goodly number of
tin cans he would cast them into a bell for the
church's belfry for nothing.
She took the proposal seriously and again
started out to raise a fund of tin cans. She
scoured tho whole county for tin cans. Id
many a neighborhood the goats had to starve
while this wonderful woman was collecting the
material forber belL Finally she bad the re
quired number of tomato, sardine and other
tin cans, and trne to his word the Pittsburg
founder mado them into a belt
They say the tone of the bell was indescriba
ble. It created a great sensation, and it must
be said a good deal of godless murmuring.
After it bad clanged for a Sunday or two, a
bold, bad man climbed into the belfry and cut
the rope off close to the bell. Since then it has
not been rung regularly.
They tell another story about the bell. One
day a Pittsbnrger went down to the town In
question to see the energetic spinster on some
matter of business. Sho was not at home, and,
after searching high and low for her, the Pltts
bnrgar was abont to go home when a church
member advised him to clamber up into tho
belfry of the church and ring the bell.
"That'll fetch the old lady, sure," tho deacon
said.
After hesitating awhile the Pittsbnrger fol
lowed tho deacon's directions, and, with some
difficulty, reached the belt He swung the
clapper to and fro onco or twice, and came near
fainting at the excruciating sound it emitted.
But before be had reached the ground the wo
man he had searchod in vain for was inquiring
in sharp tones who was tampering with the bell.
PAIR PLAY FOE ALL.
The Objeet of the Civil Service Law, as Ex
pounded by the Commission Tho System
Good, Bnt Not Tet Perfect Honesty
Venna Favoritism.
WashxkgtO!?, December a The sixth re
port ot the Civil Service Commission Cbarles
Lyman, Theodore Roosevelt and Hugh H.
Thompson was Bent to tho President to-night
The report is simply a general review of the
work done during the past year. Special atten
tion is called to the need of adequate means
to carry on the work. Paring the last fiscal
year the number of applicants examined was
abont 20,1)00, as against 11,000 the preceding
year; thus very nearly doubling tho work ac
complished while the working force remained
exactly the same. The commission asks for an
appropriation of $53,000 this year. The report
after reviewing tho changes and improvements
In the system, continues:
The merit system of making appointments
to minor Governmental positions, as contrasted
with the patronage system, whereby these ap
pointments were made as the rewards of per
sonal or political service, is no longer in the
merely experimental stage. It is not on proba
tion. It has been given full trial; and wherever
this trial has been fair the system has worked
admirably.
Perfection Nof Tet Beached.
It is not contended that the system is ideally
perfect no Governmental methods are. From
time to time there have been shown certain de
fects in the working of the civil service law
and rules,though.most of these defects already
have been, and It Is believed that the majority
ot the remainder Boon will be, remedied. Bat
it is most emphatically contended that the
merit system shows to a very great advantage
when compared with any other, whether actual
or proposed; and this is especially the case
when tbe comparison is made with tho patron
age system, which It is now slowly bnt surely
supplanting.
The fundamental proposition of tho new sys
tem is that every American citizen has a richt
to .serve the public provided that bis services
are needed It on his merits be is able to show
that be is the man most capable of filling tho
positionbe seeks, and all ho is required to do is
to show this superior capacity in fair competi
tion with other American citizens. In other
words, tbe svstem is one of common honesty
and of fair play for all, and therefore, it is es
sentially American and essentlally.democratic.
The Theory of tbe Spoilsman.
The object of tho law Is to give to the average
American citizen what it takes away from the
professional politician. .How little this object
is understood by some men in public life may
be gathered irom recent proposals to parcel
out all the ofBces among the different Con
gressional districts according to the political
faith of the Congressman representing them.
ThiB would, of course, simply mean a revival
ot tbe patronage system, with an added touch
of chaos. . . , . "
It Is apparently brought forward In tho
simple faith that all that is needed is to divide
the offices among the politicians of both parti's,
instead of among those of only one, and ignores
the very common-sense view, which Insists that
the offices are not tho proparty ot the poli
ticians at all, whether of ono party or of the
other, orofboth;4)ut on tbe contrary, that
they belong to tbe people, and should be filled
only with reference to the needs of tne publlo
service.

Over tbe Chairmanship Question.
tSFXCIAL TMOBAlt TO THI DIBPATCn.l
Bedford, December 2. The outlook for a
Democratic row was never more promising than
at present The election ot a connty chairman
takes place early in January. The working ele

the way tho present chairman. Hon. John M.
Reynolds, and his friends have been conducting
things for the past three years and are kicking
hard for a new man. Mr. Reynolds has his eye
on the judgeship and his friends claim that to
dethrone him from the chairmanship Is a sohemo
to throw the Dcmocratio nomination to a Som
erset county man. This is denied by the othor
side, who say that Reynolds has been permit
ting tho interesu of the party to go by default
and that be has driven tho whisky element
from the party, owing to his being chairman
for tho Prohibitionists daring the amendment
campaign.
Jmt who will be tho man to down Reynolds
has not been decided. Tho only names so iar
mentioned are K. F. Kerr and Frank Fletcher,

factions, which, for the pass three years has

some costnmes and gorgeous scenery, and
"Bluebeard" more than fulfills its mission. Tbe
company is very large, and embraces a number
of shapely women and several good
comedians. Edwin Fay, as OMahdi Sen
ztni, Arthur Dunn ar Mufti and Miss Esther
Williams as Ayetha caught the audience in a
topical trio, and each did excellent individual
work. Frank B. Blair was a good, or rather. In
keeping with tho character, a bad JJluebeard.
Miss Edith Mnrilla was a sprightly Fatima.
and Miss Alice Johnston, as Belmi. contributed
a good voice and pleasing presence. The bal
lets are numerous and yery novel, and tho cos.
tumes are really gorgeous. 2 be scenery is
irom tne nanus oi Albert, voegtnri anurox,
and is remarkable in its splendor. It is claimed
that this spectacnlar is the handsomest that
has ever been placed on the road, and there Is
considerable foundation for the assertion.
Several of the tableaux are dazzling with their
combination of rival colors and animated
femininity. In the midst of all this loveliness
it was sad to see that the ballet master in his
selection of local talent had obtained anything
hut a fair example of the beauty for which
Fittsbnrg has so long been famous. A large
audience witnessed the performance.
Bijou Thcnter.
Of "Later On," at the Bijon, ono may say
that It is excellent in its way. For an acknowl
edged farce-comedy this is surely high praise.
Messrs. Hallen and Hart succeed in making
everybody laugh, and the proverbially shrewd
Yorkshiremen tell us,tbat"a good laugh is worth
all you pay for it" Last night the whole Bijou
audience laughed with a vengeance, and it was
not the fault of the "Later On" company If a
good many ribs did not ache contumedly after
the performance. A good many new songs and
dances have been Introduced since "Later On"
amused Pittsburg crowds last year, and now
and then one is actually surprised by now jokes
a really remarkable thing in these dull days.
Mr. Hallen, as Plunger, is a typical young
American, and makes love just as his critlo re
members to have done In bis dear old days. His
manner of laying siego to a kiss is really
natural. It is to bo feared that Mr. Joe
Hart, who played Todd, the bookmaker,
is an irishman. His rollicking fun and de
cidedly amatory tendencies can be explained In
no other manner. "Place aux Dames" Is an
excellent motto; but in these notes It could not
be followed. The lady portion of the company
presented so many features worthy of being
dwelt upon that tbe critic, in despair, left them
to the last. Now he is forced to give up the
attempt at description In despair.
Suffice it that Miss Annie Lewis, Miss Mollle
Fuller, and Miss Carrie E. Perkins, were ad
mirable in their various parts, and everybody
envied their respective lovers, of tbe other
ladies, and tbe remainder of tho company,
there was not one who did not add to the ex
cellence of "Later On" in a marked degree.
Harry Williams' Academy.
The Sheffer fc Blakely Specialty Company
opened at tbe above theater last evening to the
usual crowded house for this place. There is a
great deal ot variety In the bill, which is fur
nished by the following artists: Lester How

now absurdities; Master Belzac, in wonderful
wire-walking and musket drill: Miss Mabel

"A Bed Hot Stove," Lester Howard's latest
farce comedy.
Harris Theater.
Notwithstanding the fact that "Beacon
Lights" was presented at this bouse late last
season, it drew two large audiences yesterday,
The play, which is full of interesting situations,
is in the hands of a competent company in
some respects, though not as strong as it was
when seen here before, -Harry O. Sinclair does
tbe best he can as Colonel Clay Calhoun, but is
not an Improvement on his predecessor, and
Miss Kitty See, as Julia Hadley, also suffers in
a like comparison. Fanny Cohen is a sprightly
Carrie, and Percy Plunkctt a real villain. Tbo
other characters are well sustained, the Mexi
can costumes are bright and new and the
scenery plenty and very good. A big week's
business is assured.
The Bloaeams.
The "Ginger Snap" Comedy Company and
the interesting collection of curiosities at
tracted the attention ot large crowds at the
World's Museum yesterday. The principals
and suspects in tbe Uronln trial are shown in
wax, in very lifelike figures. Dr. Chittenden's
collection of relics also contains much that is
worth looking at while a very funny farce
comedy is presented on the stage.
A large number of freaks and curiosities are
shown at the Casino Museum this week. Harry
Hartman is truly a wonder, and Miss Liizio
Sturgeon, wbo plays the piano with her feet is
another. Then there are tbo clever tricks of
the boy magician and the flame king, besides
tbe clever artists on tho stage, to amuse and
please.

rSFBCIAL TKLXORAK TO THE DIBFATCn.1
HavebhixIs Mass., December 2. On July
9 a Mrs. Moran, living in Kingston, N. H., left
on a seat in the Boston and Maine depot hero
a satchel containing two 8500 United States
bonds, two bank books representing 81,000, and
other articles, and on returning for them they
were gone. About a week ago a young girl
from a neighboringNew Hampshire town came
Into tbe office of a lawyer and told this story:
On July 9 she and her mother were standing
on tneaepot piauorm, wnena im; uressea in
black handed her the satchel, witb a request
to bold it while she got a ticket The lady in
black failed to return, and the girl took tbe
satchel to their New Hampshire home.- There
they looked at tbe contents, seemingly only
some cotton batting and other things. ,
The satchel was laid aside until a few days
ago, when, having need of some cotton, she
went to get it and discovered the treasure.
The next day she came to the lawyer's office
with the satchel.

-'FLOWER PRICES. ,
A Spicy Letter Prom a Retailer A 59 Per
Cent Raise Generates a Howl Sorac
thloa of Flower nnd Ynsarlea of
Wearer.
Tho blllfor flowers, received this morning, sim
ply takes oar breath away. How yon have the
neryetojump tbe prices on ns SO, per cent from
Saturday we, can't Imagine.
"And how you expect to have the gall to raise the
price proportionately on our customers we can't
understand. Now, any reasonable Increase at
this time of tbe year Is all right bnt to knock the
breath out of us like that well, we can't stand it:
that Is all there Is about it You must remember
we have great many home productions td com
pete against, and while we admit tbe blossoms are
often Inferior to those you send us, yet the differ
ence In prices Is quite an Item.
This letter Is to see If yon have any conscience.
Will await yonr reply before taking chances on
bankruptcy by sending In further orders."
The damp, cloudy weather of tho past few
weeks has in a great measure retarded the
growth of the florists' beauties, and as tbo so
ciety season is just opening and the demand
constantly increasing, the wholesalers are tak
ing advantage of the combination, of circum
stances. That their action met with a "kick"
from ono firm the above letter, copied beforo
the ink was dry, proves conclusively. Whether
or no it will be an effective remonstrance re
mains to be seen.
Mr. Dell, with J. It A. A. Murdoch, when
asked bow be felt regarding the radical increase
in the price of flowers, said;
"Well, we don't like it, but we can't help our
selves" for the New York florists control tbe
market and wo can't depend on home produc
tions, for our trade is too large, and tbe native
f;rowu flowers arc not nearly so large or luxur-
He furthermore said: "Wecxnect the win
ter prices to dawn upon ue about this time
usually, but they are making them pretty steep
this year on account of tho weather we hare
been enjoying (T) for the past month, which
has been demoralizing to the local growth of
flowers."
At A. M. t J. B. Murdoch's they woro in
clined to to take an optimistic view, and said it
was just what they had been expecting. That
summer prices had rolgned up to last Saturday,
and they could not expect them to continue all
winter. People would have the flowers any
way, and the profit was Just about the same.
Various conditions ot resignation and rebellion
were found among the other florists, and some
interesting little bits of information regarding
different varieties of flowers gleaned from
each.
Decline of Chrysanthemums.
The above lovely flowers aro losing ground,
not through lack of appreciation, for never
have they bad such a successful season as tbe
one just passed, but they are practically out of
the market now. The chrysanthemum is a
flower that has grown wonderfully id populari
ty within the past few years, and has received a
great deal ot attention from the growers of fine
flowers relative to Increasing Its beauties. The
rage for them has been national, and chrysan
themum weddings, receptions and teas have
abounded from New York to San Francisco. In
color their range is bewildering, and there is an
expert florist experimenting now with a view to
rendering the flower odorless. If he is success
ful a Vanderbiltlan fortune will be his.
Witb tbo chrysanthemum's departure, tho
harrisii lillies, beautiful in their transparent
whiteness, ana the sweet Roman hyacinths, re
ceive a warm welcome from their many ad
mirers. Long-stemed carnations in all their varied
and beautiful colors and delightful fragrance,
always have and always will be favorites, it is
safe to predict
Tbo pretty modest little violet is lovod by
many, and will, so it Is said, be a favorite doc
oration for the Oolong wave or afternoon tea
that Is threatening to make Japanese of all the
society ladies just at present and what is
sweeter or daintier than a cluster of these de
licate little blue flowers T
Roses what memories,and visions that word
recalls. Doubtless, it is one of the most sug
gestive words in the English language. How
often do people grow sick at heart, and tbe
pallor of death spread over their faces at a
-passing wnm or a tube rose T The odor pene
trating and peculiar, sweet to a sickening de
gree, recalls involuntarily to almost every one's
mind the sad obseqny rites of some dear one.
It is unusual to see them used in any other ca
pacity. Occasionally, howover, a cluster will deco
rate the lapel of some young gentleman's coat
or be tucked In a fair maiden's belt Such
always convinces the observer that the grim
reaper has not called for any of tbe loved ones
of the wearer.
Fragrant Memories.
The refreshing fragrance of the lovely la
France calls up brighter, happier remem
brances. Perhaps, to the young girl, tbe even
ing of her debut or, Indulging m a little more
sentiment the first basket ot flowers received
from the accepted lover, may be recalled by a
sight or a whiff of the deep pink flower. Tbe
creamy white bride rose, the delicate pink
Catherine Mermet the brilliant red Bennett
the pink-edged Madam Wattville. the pure
white nephetos, with leaves like silk, tho yel
low pearl and the queenly American beauty
all revive memories pleasing and sacred, joy
ous and happy. How often, many years after
the event, a bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked matron
will, by the sight or smell of a rose, become
again by mental process the radiant bride
standing at the altar, or in dress of simple
white, witn vaieuiciory in nana, renew tne
triumphs of a graduation day.
Boses, in fact all flowers, are credited with
inspiring tbe better part ot human nature to
more activity and often witb awakening dor
mant virtues, but sometimes they have tbe
opposite result An instance in mind is of a
lady who herself is responsible for tbe state
ment that whenever placed In a conservatory,
or hothouse, amid beautiful flowers ar almost
insane desire to steal some wonld possess her.
Even in the most sacred places she was not
exempt from this impulse; walking through a
cemetery where beautiful flowers abounded
she would control her desires by the exercise
of her will power solely. And never, under any
other circumstances, did each a thought ob
trude itself.
Very amusing scenes aro witnessed in the
florists' stores, and they say that it is abso
lute! v necessary for them to have the heaviest
French plate glass mirrors to withstand the
strain that is constantly put upon them.
An example of the vanity of man was wit
nessed yesterday, when a teputed Count
entered a well-kriown establishment for the
purposo of purchasing a bouquet for a lady.
After giving bis order, and while awaiting Its
preparation, he took up a position in
front ot tbe mirror, and apparently
oblivions of everything but Ills own dear little
self he posed and primped. Yes, and primped
and posed, arranged his coatcollar, curled his
mustache, adjusted his handkerchief so tbe
"mer would peek out coqnettisbly, twisted
his bead to tbe verge of dislocating bis neck to
see bow be appeared in the rear, and when be
luncluded to wear a scarlet carnation after
deciding that that was tho proper color to con
trast with hie necktie, spent five minutes in
obtaining just tbe proper degree of slant in
the button bole. He is a regular customer.
Another one, a lady, whose only weaknesses
are chewing gnm and wearing flowers, so she
asserts, is very particular abont where and
how she affects each. In the latter a sad tax
is she to the florist, for she insists upon his
pinning tbe blossoms in place, and tbe entire
extent of ber upper anatomy is canvassed with
the cluster often before the proper longitude
and latitude is obtained. In this case, also, the
mirror is subjected to sovera and long-continued
nro. Bnt all who indulge these
"whims" are good advertisements for the flor
ist, and he bottles up bis wrath and assumes
a patient, perpetual smile when ho sees them
entering his store. TnoRlfE Branch.

A Little Hippopotamus.
Fatima Murphy, wife ef Caliph Murphy, the

birth to a fine black eyed little Murphy at 10

pounds, about SO pounds less than a baby blp
ponotamus usually weighs. Nevertheless, it is
healthy, and as frisky as a kitten. It is of a
deep reddish color, shading here and there into
pink, and has a very big month, even for a Nile
baby. Fatima will nourish her infant for about
ten months, when she will proceed to wean it
in the most approved form. After that it will
dine with its parents on bran, oats, bay and
other delicacies.
Doesn't Bellevo Brlco Will Win.
The Hon. Julius Dexter, the lone mugwump
of Cincinnati, has been telling the politicians
at his hotel, to-day, why he thinks Calvin S.
Brice will not succeed Senator Payne in Con
gress. He said: "I aro. not so sure as most
people that Colonel Brice will be elected. The
strongest point against him, and one that Is
being urged for all It i3 worth. Is that he is a
non-resident Some have it that be even did
not vote iu Ohio. Doubtless money will have
some influence, bnt I do not think the Legisla
ture of Ohio will select a Senator on account
of his wealth. Alien O. Myers speech, advis
ing the members of tbe Legislature not to elect
a millionaire, will have some effect But Col
onel Brice's wealth is not against him so much
as the fact that be Is a resident ot this city.
There are several candidates in the field, and
in my judgment either of them stand as good a
chance as Colonel Brice. They are Thomas, of
Springfield, MoMahon, of Dayton, and Mr.
Neal. They are well known in tbe State, and
are residents of long standing. These three
candidates might, after a few ballots, consent
to join their forces and defeat Colonel Brice.
My idea is tbat Colonel Brice will not have a
walkover, and may never reach the goal first

Her Jewelry l Safe.
Mrs. James Crawford has annoyed the city
police greatly to-day by telling how she lost and
recovered 10,000 worth of diamonds recently.
Mrs. Crawford is a woman of wealth and a rela
tive of tho late Commodore Garrison. Ten
days ago she hid her diamond earrings, dia
mond brooch and other jewelry under a bit of
bric-a-brac in her back parlor. Only a servant
whom she had had for years, and a seamstress
knew where she had placed the trinkets. Two
days later the jewelry vanished. Mrs. Craw
ford told tho police all about her loss, and they
atonce pitched upon the seamstress as the
thief. After several scenes, in which the sus
pected woman and Mrs. Crawford went Into
hysterics, tbe police decided they bad made a
mistake and tried the trustedservaut Several
more scenes andno traces ot tbe jewelry were
tbe results. No clew to the identity ot tbe
thief had been discovered until this morning,
when a messenger boy appeared at Mrs. Craw
ford's door witb a little box. While Mrs,.
Crawford was undoing the package the boy
ran away. The box contained all of the miss
ing jewelry, carefully packed, but unaccom
panied by a word of explanation. The police
explain their inability to clear up the mystery
by maintaining tbat some of Mrs. Crawford's
friends have merely bad a little lark with her
and her diamonds.

and were sticking knives into him. Three Ital

And the boatman so grim

How Jeep that the waters may flow;
Tis best to be ready,
With strong hand and steady,
When over the ferry we go.
The black clouds may lower
In this trying hour,
In darkness and peril we row;
The lightnings may flash,
The waters may dash.
The thunders may roar as we go;
But if we are ready,
With strong band and steady,
(God alone can courage bestow),
There's nothing can harm us.
And nangut will alarm us,
When over the ferry we go.
Ay, over the ferry,
A haven so cheery
Lies bright in eternity's glow;
Then over the river
Without even a skiver,

team of '7t A match bad been arranged be
tween tbe elevens of Cornell and Rochester

kicking a bag around a ten-acre lot Then to

The first aerial voyagers were a sheep, a
cock and a duck, which were placed in an osier
basket attached to tbe lower part of a bal

family "assisting" at the spectacle. The ascen

brother, Joseph, the invention of tbe balloon
is dne. Tbe sheep and duck and cock reached
the ground again in safety. The first air voy

CharlesKellogg recently shot a very
peculiar-looking bird near his grist win on the
outskirts of Great Harrington, Mass. No one
seemed to know to what species it belonged,
and it was sent to a naturalist in Boston, who
writes as follows: "Tbe bird is a Florida gal-' '
llnule; its native place is in the South, prin
cipally Florida. This bird was batched this
year, and It is not unusual for young birds to
leave their place of nativity and travel In the
opposite direction from which they should.
You can consider this bird a decided prise on
account of the locality from which it was taken,
as It is tbe first recorded instance of one being
found in tbe Berkshire Hills." The bird has
gray plumage and is web-tooted.
The latest version of "The girl I left
behind me," comes from California. In this
case the young man did not seem to realize the
girl's attractions until he got across the conti
nent and then, after a, year or two of hard
work in California and with tbo prospect of
wealth before him, be bethought himself of a
young lady who used to be a schoolmate ot his
in Maine. He wrote to her to see if she had
forgotten him. She hadn't and cordially an
swered tbe letter. The return mail brought a
proposal of marriage, which was accepted. A
ticket for California came next, and though
her friends did not quite approve of the
journey, the young lady started. Unlike some
who have made similar trips, she liked both
the farm awaiting her and Its possessor even
better than she thought she did beforo she saw
tbem. The wedding came next, and everybody
was happy at last accounts
A laborer near Starke, Fla., who owns
a large flock of chickens, has been much
troubled of late by wildcats and .hawks, which
caught his fowls. Compelled to be away from
borne all day he cannot shoot the hawks. The
other day he tied his heavily loaded gun to a
stump in the potato patcb and trained the gun
at the top of a dead tree, where hawks often
light tied a long clothes line to the trigger and
told his wife to pull it when she sawa hawk in
the tree. Soon a bog broke through; the fence,
and after filling np on potatoes proceeded to
scratch himself against the gnn, whereby its
muzzle became lowered. He got tangled in
the line and drew the trigger, tbe charge ex
ploded and it was afterward found that it had
killed an enormous wildcat hid In some pal
mettoos in a fence corner. The .butt of the
gun, in recoiling, struck the hog between the
eyes and killed him, and thus by good luck the
man got rid of two beasts of prey at one time.
