pealed, and existing banks may bo enlarged

discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury;
but no more bills than are now author
ized by the banking act shall hereafter
be issued unless the Secretary of the
Treasury at the time of their issue, can
and does not cancel and destroy a uko
amount of legal tenders; and thej increase
of bank bills hereby authorized, shall

ed by tne secretary oi tne xreasury as to

interests of different States.

sons in favor of tho bill : 1. It will creato
a demand for our national bonds, and to
this extent fortify tho national credit 2. It
will tend to satisfy those parts of country,

and banks are wanting, and thus arrost a
difficult question. 3. It will not expand
or contract tho currency bo that opposite
parties on the speculation may support it 4.
Undent banks wm gradually be strengtn-
cned and prepare to resume specie payment
It will give tne ooutn ana west tne
oDDortunitv to orcanizo banks', "and will
interest theso parts of tha country to this
extent in national securities and the na
tional banking system, by which both will
bo strengthened. C. It will, within a rea

A STARTLING REPORT.
The Iiivestlcntloii into the lUanacrci
uicntol tne Treasury uepanmeiu
at Washington Over Xvo million
Hollar unaccounted For.
Correspondence of the Cincinnati Commercial.
Washington, Dec. 3. Over two years
a!io Congress appointed a select commit
tee of two Senators, Edmunds, chairman,
and one Representative, to inquire into
the charges against the management of the
Treasury department. After two years'
thorough examination of witnesses in the
Treasury Department.'machinery, books,
etc., the committee makes a report, it
will be recollected the charges were that
affairs in the Treasury Printing and iSotc
Bureau were earned on in a criminally
reckless manner, resulting in enormous
losses to the people ; conduct so loose a3
to call for the intervention of Congress,
as tuc men recrctary oi uic treasury
took no heed of the warning.
The report of the committee, covering
several hundred pages, sustains the
charges, and establishes that tho aggregate
securities created by the Government from
1860. to October 31, 1867. were $8,27,
000,000, of which amount $4,827,000,000
in bonds, certificates, etc., were printed
by the bureau : that $166,450 of tho
second series of the seven-thirty loan are
unaccounted for, and missing; that dupli
cations of five-twenties of 1862 were
executed in the Treasury Department ;
that over cmht thousand notes ot live
twenties, third scries, amounting to $1,
595.000, lfavc not been satisfactorily ac
counted for ; that various bonds marked
destroyed" on the books of the depart
ment are not destroyed, or at least no
proof offered ; that methods of accoun
tability between tne various bureaus in
the department, ns well as in their own
operations, have been grossly careless
that vouchers were taken lor inter
change of securities, from bureau to bu
reau, on suns of paner. leaving no
recorded evidence of the transactions;
that iu printing and transmitting
fcccuritics to the Register's office it was the
practice to send with each 1,000 iinpres-
sions ten or more extra impressions, culled
"stock-package, ' to supply the place ot
any that micht be accidentally uetaccd;
when the bond was injured, or said to bo
injured, it was thrown in the hre, or said
to have been destroyed, and an "extra,
or a "stock-package" used in its stead,
but no account taken, or record of tho
transaction made.
Such arc a few ol the specimens se
lectcd from the voluminous report, show
ing that over two million of dollars arc
unaccountable for. and leaving the una
voidable impression that many hundred
thousand more than tho committee men
lion must have been lost or mislaid.

postofflce and independent treasury
building in. the city of Boston. The super
vising architect of tho Treasury Depart-
partmcnt is of the opinion that the walls
and roofs of tho building may be completed
during the next year if sufficient appropria
tions aro furnished. Tho works ha vmg been
undertaken, I am of opinion that it is
economical to make the necessary appro
priations for their speedy completion.
During tne month ot December tne de
partment will be prepared to submit a
report upon tho condition of our commer
cial marine. That report will show that
the navigation interests of tho country
havo not recovered from tho losses sus
tained during the war, and. that efficient
measures aro necessary for its restoration.
X cannot omit to" call tho attention ol
Congress to the inadequacy of the salaries
paid to officers in the Treasury Depart
ment who exercise discretion -and whose
acts bind the Government, or affect
directly its expenditures or revenues.
Some of tho salaries wero fixed when
tho Government was organizod; others
when now officers wero added: and but few
of thorn have beeu increased recently. It
13 pnquostionably truo that persons hav
ing equal abilities, and clotned with
similar responsibility, receive mucn larger
compensation from individuals and corpo
rations. Although many of r tho officers
now in public sorvico aro likely to contin
ue, from the circumstance that their voca
tion has led them aside from the ordinary
channels of business,- yet,- as an act of jus
tice to theni. and in "the interest of the
,govemment, I recommend an increase of
their pay. bpoakmg generally, this in
crease of pay should bo extended to reve
nue officers in custom service, such
as collectors, surveyors, naval offl
ceis, and especially to appraisers and
examiners in the appraising department
Should the recommendation to repeal tho
laws granting shares of penalties and fines
and forfeitures to public officers bo adopted,
it will be necessary io increase the sala
ry of collectors, naval officers and survey-
. ors at all tho principal points in tho coun
try. It is a plain truth that the gov
ernment has no right to expect tho services
of such competent men as appraisers and
examiners at tho present inadequate sala
ries. In tho larger cities, they are insuffi
cient for the support of a family; and, un
der such circumstances, tho government 13
not without responsibility, when it
places its officers in such positions
that they aro compelled to choose be
tween dishonesty on the one hand, and
cunning on the other . The salaries of
the Assistant Treasurer and the principal
officers should, also, be increased and for
substantially the same reasons. It has
been found impossible for the last tew
years to retain the services of the most
efficient clerks in the Treasurer depart
ment, except by additions to their law
ful salaries through an appropriation
placed in the hands oftho Secretary for
that purpose. Tho distribution of this ap
propriation is an unpleasant duty for the
Secretary, and cannot be performed
without producing jealousy and dis
content in the department. Speak
ing generally, it may be said the
heads of bureaus, chief clerks and clerks
in charge of divisions aro inadequately
compensated lor tho services tney penorm.
Tho routine business of the departaiont can
bo performed in a satisfactory manner by
the clerks receiving the compensation now
provided by the law; but thoso on whose
discretion and judgment tho government
relies for the proper transaction 01 tno
business of tha country and whose labors
are not limited to the ordinary hours of
duty, should bo mado to feel that they aro
properly compensated.
There are two changes in tno or
ganization of the Treasury Depart
ment which 1 consider important.
Tho first chance to which I refer is
to tho creation of a Chief Comptroller
of the Treasury, who shall be authorized
to- control the system of accounting
by tho Beveral Auditors, and to
whom all appeals shall be made upon
questions arising in the accounting offices
of tho Treasury, the creation 01 inis omce,
clothod with the powers indicatod, will give
uniformity to the accounting system, and I
trust it will be in tho power of the officers
appointed to simplify the system and
materially reduce the oipenses of tho de
partment m this particular, ine secono
chance to which 1 can attention is, in my
opinion, oven more important. At present
there are eight divisions in the Secretary's
office whoso duties are connocted
exclusively with the customs and revenue
system. There is no person except
the secretary ol tne ireasury wno 13
authorized to pass finally, or in any way
authoritatively, upon questions arising in
tho administration of the customs and re ve
nue laws. At tho present timo the revenue
from customs is as larce as tho levenue
from the excise system. ' Tha number of
men employed, and tho Hold of its opera
tions, aro nearly as great. It is impossible
for the Secretary of tho Treasury to give
tho various questions that arise in tno ad
ministration of the system, that at-
intinn which is essential to the service.
Tho duties of superintendinc the col
lections of customs and revenue,
aro so varied, delicato and important,
as to justify and require the exclusive at
tention ol tno most cumpoieuv jioinuu
whose services can be obtained. The ex
perience of the present year in the admin
istration of tho internal revenue system
and tho collection of excise tax, justifies
tho opinion that tha establishment of an
office of Commissioner of Customs of Rev
enue, corresponding in power and position
to that of Commissioner of Internal Rev
enue, and the appointment of a competent
commissioner would render the execution
of the customs revenuo laws much more
efficient and harmonious, while the revo-
nuo would probably be increasod to the
amount of many millions of dollars annually.
Nor is it probable that tho expenses would
bo materially greater.
Including tho interest earned ana
not paid, and deductin; the cash
on hand, tho debt of tho United
Stites on tho 1st of March last was
$2,C23,4G5,2r0.01: and, subject to the
same condition, it was $2, 4 53, 539, 735.23
on the 1st of tho present month, show-
inn a decreaso of i?71, 903,524,78. This
apparont decrease 01 tne puoiio aeoi
is less than tho actual decrease. Consider
niiln sums have been paid on account of tho
war and other old claims not previously as-
rnriiuncd. and therefore not included in
anv debt statement. The account of March
1st. from tno necessity 01 uio case, in-
rlnded only tho interest accrued and not
then payable ; but, as a matterof fact, there
wero outstanding ana overuuo imurast cou
pons amounting to several millions, which
have since been paid out of the ordinary
revenue, itovious to Aiarcn 1 no inter
est account had ever been kept with the
several loans. Such measures as were
found practicable havo since been taken to
ns(nrlftin the exact condition of thoso
amounts. The bonds issued by tho United
States in aid ot railroads, nmonnting
to $03,623,320, being in tho nature
of loans, are not included in the loregoing
stAtement. Dunne tho fiscal year ending
.Tune 30. 1800. there was an excess 01
receipts over the expenditures, including
tno interest on puuuu uou. w ,if,iw(.
149.40. Of this excess 12,992,370.30 as
nearly as can now be ascertained, arose
previous to March 1, and tho remainding
36,460,779.43 between that time and
tho 1st of July. This excess was ap
Tilied from time to time to the purchase
of 5-20 bonds, and the excess of receipts
since July 1, has been used in the same
manner. Tho purchases amounted in the
the aggregate on tho 30th of No
vember to S75,47B,?00. As a large
part of tho excess of tho receipts
was realized on coin, sales of gold have
been mado from timo to timo, and tho
nroceeds applied to the purchase of bonds.
With tha exception of tho sale of mod
erate amonnts of coin in Chicago, New
Orleans, St. Louis, and Baltimore for the
payment of duties, the sale of gold and the
nnrchaso of bonds have been made
uniformly throngh the agency of
the United States Treasury at New
York and without any expense to tho Gov-
eminent except tho comparatively small
omnnnt ruiirt fnr ndvArtLiinc nronosals.
The average premium on gold sold since
March 1, has been 22 8-100 per cent,
and the averace promium paid for bonds
has been 1C 98-100 per cent Upon this
basis of the sales of cold and the purchase
of bonds, the average prices paid for bonds
in com ha3 been So o.-ioo per cent.
The act of Feb. 25, 1562, pro
vided that the coin received for
duties upon imported goods should bo
annually set apart as a sinking fund to tho
extent ot one per cent, 01 tno enure in.
debtednees of tho United States. In con
formity with this requirement, I have pur
chased bonds to the amount of $20,044,
800, and designated them as belonging, to
the sinking fund. These purchases are a
substantial .compliance, with tho statute"
from the 4th of March last ' L have not
felt myself authorized or required to make
any provision for the time that elapsed after
the passage of the act and, previous to tho
commencement of tha administration.
"With the excess of the means at my' com
mand I have purchased bonds, in addi
tion to thosa purchased for the sinking
fund, to the amount of $55,432,000. These
are held as a special fund, subject to the
action of Congress, and I respectfully rec
ommend that they be added to the sinking
fund, and that any further purchases that
may bo mado be so added until the gross
amount shall constitute a fond equal to
that which would have been created if
there had been no delay in the execution
of the law. y
The depreciation of the currency is due
to two causes first, an excessive issue ;,
and secondly, to the want of faith in the
government, and tho extent of the
influence of tha first named cause
cannot bo ascertained until the
second is removed substantially.
Whenever our credit shall be so much im
proved at homo and abroad that the hold
ers of our bonds are disposed to retain
them when tho public are excited upon
financial subjects, we' shall he able to judge
mora accurately as to the extent of the, over
issue of paper money. It is also true that
the quantity of currency necessary for tho
transaction of the business of tho country
cannot be fixed accurately. Since the close
of tho war, the wants of tha States
of the South have increased, and,
consequently, a large amount of
currency has been withdrawn from 'othor
sections to supply tha domand there crea
ted, lho amount necessary lor the pur
poses of tho South will steadily increase
for the next two years.
The construction of tho 1'acmc ixaiiroad
is lixely to result in tho substitution 01
paper for coin by the people on the Pacific
coast It is probable that the demand for
paper for tho pnrposo will not bo lesj than
S30.000.000. As a consequenco a' very
largo quantity of coin will ba withdrawn
from circulation, nnd thus, 'practically, the
coin will bo increased on the Atlantic
coast, and the paper circulation in;
the States east of the Rocky
Mountains bo materially reduced. These
changes will tend to diminish tho dinerence
between paper and coin.
ine aoimy 01 tno country to resume
specie payment will not he duo
to any special legislation on that
subject, but to tho condition of its m-
dustnes and to tho financial relations with
othor countries. These, of course, will be
mora or Jess dependent on the general pol
icy of tho government Tho war exhausted
the country of its material wealth, and tho
States of tha South were literally impov
erished. A necessary condition Tor tho
resumption of specie payments was tho de
velopment of the industry of tho nation,
both South and North, and tha consequont
accumulation of movable products of in
dustry to such an extent that ourexportsof
those products should be equal substantial
ly to out imports. So long as it is necessary
to pay for merchandise imported by tho
transfer of government bonds and other
evidences of indehtness to other countries,
so long it will be impracticablo to resume
and maintain specie payment When the
prodncw 01 industry exported snail bo
equal substantially to the products of other
countries imported, there will ba no de
mand for specie for export, except what
may arise from tha circumstances that our
bonds now abroad are sent home and sold
in our market and the proceeds exported
in com. When the credit 01 our country
shall be folly established in Europe, and
there shall be no doubt, either oi our
ability or disposition, to meet all of our ob
ligations, the bond3 heretofore and now,
to a large extent, held by merchants and
bankers will bo transferred to capitalits
for permanent investment. When this
chango shall have taken place, tho proba
bility of our securities being sent homo un-.
der the influence of political or financial
disturbances in England will be very light
and when, as a concurrent fact onr ex
ports, exclusive of public socunties, shall
bo equal to our imports, specie payment
may be resumed without even a temporary
embarrassment to tho business of the
country.
One of the most efficient moans of
strengthening the country in its financial
relations wiui oiuor couxiinua u iua uavoi
onment of its commercial marine. Tho
1 . ... , 1
returns show that a very large amount 01
foreign trade 13 in jigusn hands. We are
not only thus dependent upon a rival coun
try for the performance of tho business
which should be in the hands of our own
people, but our ability to maintain specie
payment is materially diminished. If tho
entiro foreign trade 01 tho country, ootn
of exports and imports, were carried on in
American ships, tho earning would not be
less than $75,000,000. Were tho trade
exclusively in American hands a large
part of this difference of $47,000,000 would
.be dno to citizens of the United States, and
payable in other countnes. This amount
would be thus added to our
ability to pay for goods imported from
thoso countries. Ii for example an American
citizen purchase in New York a thousand
barrels of flour for $6,000, and export it
to Liverpool in an American vessel, and
it is there sold for $7,000, n bill of ex-
chancre may he down against the proceeds
and an invoico of coods of tho value of
$7,000, pnrchased in England entirely
liquidated, although at the custom houso at
.New Yorfe, thero would he an apparont
balance against the country of $1,000- But
if, on the other hand, tho thousand barrels
of flour aro exported in a lintish vessel.
the proceeds of flour realized in New York,
and which can be applied to the payment
of goods bought in England, will be only
$6,000, and there will remain an actual
balance asainst the country of $ 1,000. This
familiar example shows the importanco 01
re-establishing our commercial supremacy
on the ocean, and I deem it, therefore, es
sential to our
interest of tho country bo fostered,
lition, but the amount can bo reduced from,
.the ordinary revenue of the- country,
if ,Oongress shall consider it expedient to
make provision for. such, reduction. The
fractional currency in circulation was
$33,885,564.63, and there' is so occa
sion for any legislation in reference to this,
item of tho public debt . There were out
standing, also, certificates for gold deposi
ted in tho Treasury lo the amount of
$36,862,910. Theso' certificates are to
deemable on presentation- These thi'I
items amount in tho aggregate to$lol,SGl,
763; and, in making provision for
tha public debt, they aro not necessary to
ba considered. Of tha loan of January 1,
1861, tho sum of $7,022,000 is lout
standing and payable on the 1st of
January, 1871? tho loan of 1858 of $20,000,-
000 is payable in 1873. j tha bonds
known as 10 per cent bonds, amounting
to $194,5C7,300 are not payable rmtil
1875; theG percent bonds, payable inl831,
amount to $283,677,000, As tha bonds
known as 8 por cents, and 10 per
cehts.,amounting in tho aggregate to $ 178,
244,900, aro not due, and cannot ba
paid, until 1874 and 1881, it is unnecessary
to consider them in making provisions for
a new loan. Tho 5-20 bonds, amounting
in tho aggregate to $1,602;671,100, are
either due or will soon become due,
and it it to this class of tho puhlio
debt, and to this alone, that
attention should be directed- Of this
amount the sum of $35,477,800 has been
purchased since March last, and tha bonds
am now held by the government Before
any measure- for funding tha 5-20 bonds
can ba consummated, tha government will
purchaso atleast $"5,000. OOQmore. Thero
will then remain on tho 1st of July next
about $1,450,000,000 of the 5-20 bonds in
tho hands of tho public creditors. Of the.
entire, indebtedness of the United States"
only tho unimportant sum of $27,000,000
will be dua and payablo previous to 1874.
Under theso circumstances, it does not
seem to mo to Ta wise to authorize tha
funding of tha whole amount of five-twenty
bonds, which, as is .now anticipated, will
bo outstanding on 1st July' next but that
250,000,000 dollars at least should bo suf
fered to remain either for purchase or re
demption, previous to 1874. Should the
sum of 230,000,000 dollars ba left for that
purpose, tho entire public debt would ba
,in a condition to ba easily redeemed be
tween 1874 and 1881. The ten-forty bonds
could ba paid and provision also made for
tha redemption, of bonds which will bacoma
dua jn the year 1881- It may be wiso lo
reduce tho proposed loan to 1,000,000,000
dollars which would then leavo for pay
ment previous to 1831, he sum of about
670,000,000 dollars, or hardly more than
60,000,000 dollars a year. Assuming that
proposed loan will bo for an amount not
exceeding 1,200,000,000 dollars, I recom
mend that it be offered in three classes" of
400,000.000 dollars each. Tho first class
of 400,000,000 dollars to be payablo in fif
toen years, and to bo paid in twenty years.
Tho second class of 400,000,000 dollars to
be payable in twenty years, and to bo paid
in twenty-five years- Tho third class of 400,
000,000 dollars to bo payable in twenty-five
years, and to bo paid in thirty years. Tha
essential conditions of the new loan ap
pear to mo to be these: 1. That the
principal and interest shall bo made paya
blo in coin. 2. That tho bonds known as
5:20 bonds shall be received in exohange
1 for now bonds. X That tha principal ba
payable in this country, and tho interest
payablo either in tho United Stales or in

ductions or abatements' of any sort, unless
it shall be thonght wise to subject citizens
of tho United States to such tax upon in
comes from bonds as is imposed by tho
laws of tho United States upon incomes
dorived from other money investments.
There are two reasons, each seeming to bo
a controlling reason, why bonds should ba
exempt from State and local taxe3:
1. If not so exempt, the amount of the
taxes imposod by the local authority will
bo added to the interest; tho government
will then ba required to pay, and thus
tho national government will bo compelled
to provide for taxes imposed by tho local
anthonties.
Inasmuch as the ability to borrow
may under somo circumstances be essential
to tho preservation ot mo government, ii
nowors should not even in timo of peace
and prosperity, be qualified by any conces
sion to tho States of tha right to tax the
means by which tho national government is
maintained. Iho ngut to uso lawmi
powers, free of any condition, restriction
or claim of anothor, is an essential con
dition of sovereignty, and the national
government should never squander or
qualify its power in this particular. In of
fering the new loan, citizens and subjects
of other countries should receive tho
strongest assurance that tho interest arid

to the terms of the bonds issued, without
any deduction or abatement whatever. In
order to avoid the necessity of employing
agents for tho negotiation of tho loan, I
respecttmiy recommend mat a iioerai com
mission bo allowed subscribers, and that
those who first subscribe bo ponnitted to
select tho class of bonis ic which
their subscriptions respectively shall
be made.
I further recommend in connection
with the proposed loan that banks
established under the act lo provide

tute bonds mat may 00 -sbucu uuucir uw

security for the redemption of their bills.

evil does not end with the impoverishment
of the country: as the banks in. the cities
may be called on at any moment to respond
to; drafts of their depositors,, they decline
to'make loans representing such funds on
commercial paper payable on time, hut in
sist on making call loans, as they are
termed, with Government bonds or other
obligations pledged as collateral security.
Merchants generally will not borrow; money
in large sums' payable upon deroantL" Tha
consequence is, that monies thus accumu
lated in city .banks are loaned to persona
engaged in speculative pursuits. Tha ex
tent of this evil is seen in. tho
fact that of. tho, bank loans in
the city of' New York in I8C3,
33,000,000 wera upon commercial paper,
and $08,000,000 on demand, with pledgo
of collaterals, and In October, 1SG9$39,
000,000 wera upon commexcul paper, and
$59,000,000 on demand. In the former
year, forty-one per cent, and in tha latter
year thirty-seven, per cent of tho loans
made by the Aow xortc banss were upon
demand. A further result is seen in the
fact that parties borrowing money,. Upon,
commercial paper, for legitimate commer
cial purposes, jay from three to six pet
cant additional interest per annum al com
pared, with persons who borrow mosey for
speculative purposes. I, therefore, re
spectfully recommend that a law be. passed
prohibiting absolutely payment of interest
by banks upon deposits, and limiting' also
their loans upon collaterals to an, amount
not exceeding ten por cent of their capital.
I am satisfied also that the practice of
certifying; checks when funds ard in

ought to-txf entirely prohibited.

as important to the States and peoplo re
mote from tho sea-coast as it is to the mari

The suggestions that I havo mado
indicate my opinion that it will not
be wise to resume specie payments while
bo large a part of the interest beanng debt
of the country is represented by 5 20 bonds
and hold by European merchants, bankers
and manufacturers. The questions that
havo been raised in regard to the naturo of

admit of no doubt In fine, the practical
question is not merely the resumption of
specie payment, as a measure oy liseii, it
is not difficult, but the problem is to re
sume under such circumstances that the
position can be maintained, not only in
times of tranquillity, but also in peril. O nr
course, it seems to me, is plain. Every
measure of the government bearing upon
the subject should tend to appreciate the
value of our paper currency. It is proba
ble that some decreaso in tho volume of pa
per will ultimately bo necessary, and
I therefore respectfully suggest that
the Secretary of the Treasury be
clothed with authority to reduce tho cir-
