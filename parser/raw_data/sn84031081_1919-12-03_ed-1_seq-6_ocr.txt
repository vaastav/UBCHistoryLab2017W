THE I'KESIDEXT S MESSAGE.
The message ot President Wilson to
congress on its reassembling is a
strong state paper, from the pesident's
standpoint. He expresses his views
with all of his old-time vigor. How
ever much his physical strength muy
he impaired, his mind has lost noth
ing of its virility.
The strongest point made by the
president is his demand that collective
bargaining shall be recognized. With
out discussing the value of unions
the Journal believes in them it Is dif
ficult to see just how the president ex
pects congress to compel the union!-1
zntion of labor. Only a comparatively
small percentage of the labor of the
country Is now unionized. The great!
majority of lubor Is not in unions,
because it prefers not to be.
How is labor to be compelled to
unionise, so us to make collective bar
gaining possible? How is capital to
be compelled to deal with tho union?
If capital is to be legally bound to col
lective bargaining, the unions must
also be bound so they will become re
sponsible for their contrai'te. Samuel
(jumpers admits the logic of this con-j
tention, and" he is bitterly opposed,
therefore to any such program.
Unless the president means that
congress shall authorize compulsory
arbitration and compel the unioniza
tion of all labor, why does he make
such suggestions in his address?
There is always the matter of par
tizan politics to be looked for in any
utterance by Woodrow Wilson. Great
as he is intellectually, he never has
lost sight of advantage to his parly
through his own official acts and ut
terances. That was evidenced in his
appeal to the country to elect all
democratic candidates to the national
congress in order to win the war.
In his message, the president blames
the industrial unrest chiefly upon fail
ure of the senate to ratify the covenant
of nations as he brought it from
l'aris. It will be recalled that he
charged the strike of the Boston, po
lice to the same cause. And that he
also charged the high cost of living
and the race riots and about all the
other evils to the obstinacy of the re
publican senate.
That there is a demand for a na
tional budget system, we can all agree.
It is a crying need, nnd was urged
upon a democratic congress for eight
years. The republicans may pass such
n bill, or they may not. There is little
disposition among congressmen to take
out of their hands ability to log-roll
for appropriations. That greater econ
omy should be exertiised, everyone will
also agree. Hut that might have com
menced in the departments more than
a year ago.
Also the president urges reduction
in taxation, but he falls to take note
of the fact that on his recommenda
tion the late democratic congress laid
the taxes for 1920, as well as for 1919
But, notwithstanding, the president
delivered a strong message to con
gress, and It wa9 expressed In beauti
ful and forceful language. The Jour
nal, following its habit, prints the ad
dress in full. '
no probability that the president will
stand out against sppe'ific,reservations
regarding the Monroe doctrine and
our control of our domestic affairs.
Certainly he will not insist that the
United States endorse the Shantung
agreement.
The real fight In the next campaign
probably will be between radicalism
and the sentiment which stands for
the preservation of the authority of
the government as approved by ma
jority of the electorate. . '
COMMF.nctUj fSFS OF THE
, AIM 'LANES.
Two practical uses for aviation
have already been reduced to an ey-ery-day
business basis. First, for
carrying the mails; second, for pa
trolling forests for discovery of forest
fires.
The last named is the more vital,
since destruction of timber lands In
jures every person in the country by
making building materials scarce.
Every forest region should be equip
ped at once with airplane observers.
and should be carefully watched so
that fires may be fought when they
first start.
An airplane could apparently be
handled in ordinary forest regions by
cutting landing places. Thus some
fire-fighting equipment could be
transported in a minimum of time,
and the airplane fire-engine may be
the next thing. Forest lands may yet
become nearly as safe as city proper
ty. If their fire hazards could thus
be reduced, there would be an induce
ment to raise timber. Building ma
terials would become once more
abundant.
The airplane will be found of use
in mining, engineering, Irrigation ana
water-power projects In rough or des
ert country. It may now take days
to cross a canyon or desert with some
needed article of equipment, where
the airplane could do it in a few
minutes.
How far the plane will be used In
ordinary farm country is as yet a
problem. So far as can now be
Judged, it will require a certain tem
perament nnd ability to operate one.
It looks now as if It would be a very
long time before the average farmer
would use it for quick transportation
to his city market. But it Is never
safe to set limits to the achievements
of technical science-. Tho people who
now look askance nt aviation may
eventually seem as eccentric as those
who used to be fearful of railroad
trains.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE IS

economical lines, to improve market
ing, and to make rural life more at
tractive and healthful, is obvious. I
THE NEXT CAMPAIGN.
There Is little doubt that tho
League of Nations question will be
nettled before the political conven
tions are held next year, therefore
will not be an Issue In the presidential
campaign. Of course, H IS qulto pos
sible that the president will stand
firmly by his position that Article X
is the heart of the treaty and that to
modify It would kill the wholo league
feature. There is no doubt that the
senate wilt stand by Its reservation.
Thus a deadlock and referenco to the
voters ot the nation Is a possibility.
Article X reads as follows:
"The members of the league under
take to respect and preserve as against
external aggression the territorial in
tegrity and existing political independ
ence of all members of the league. In
case of any such aggression or in case
of any threat or danger of such ag
gression the council shall advise upon
the moans by which this obligation
shall be fulfilled."
The reservation, adopted by the
senate by a vote of fifty-four out of a
membership then of ninety-five a
clear majority of thirteen follows:
"The United States assumes no offli
gation to preserve the territorial in
tcgrity or political independence of
any other country or to interfere in
controversies between nations
whether members of the league or not
under the provisions of Article X,
or to employ the military or naval
forces of the United States under ans
article of the treaty for any purpose,
unless in any particular case the con
gross, which, under the constitution,
has the sole power to declare war or
authorize the employment of the mill
tary or naval forces of the United
States, shall by act or Joint resolution
so provide,"
I there is a deadlock and a national
campaign launched to break it, it will
come from differences between the
chief executive and the senate over
that one point. It is not conceivable
that the president will seriously object
to limiting the vote of the British em
ptre in the league to the same number
that a United States will have.
.Thore is no Hf'ftse.forJJtaJn.to ha,v

GOING AFTER OVIt RIGHTS.
The convention of advocates of Ir
rigation in western states, held at Salt
Lake, was a direct result of the meet
ing of governors of arid states whom
Governor Larrazolo asked to assemble
to start effective plans for securing
release of the public lands to the
states. , ,
The irrigation representatives form
ed a reclamation association with an
executive committee composed of one
member from each of tho thirteen
states classed as arid. This associa
tion Is to at once vigorously go after
congress for ' an appropriation of
$250,000,000 for completion of many
projects in order that 17,000,000 acres
of land may become available, for
settlement and production for the
good of the entire nation.
Immediately a fund will tie raised
to pay for the expense of having a
delegation from the Btates go to wash
lngton. to interest congressmen of tho
cast in the merits of the plan.
The American Legion will be askod
to send delegates to co-operate with
the reclamation forces In order that
greater opportunity may be made for
soldier settlement, to provide employ
ment and homes for those who served
tv,oif r-riiintrv in war. It was recom
mended that in all reclamation work
ex-service men should be' given pref
crence.
New Mexico is ably represented on
this executive committee by Francis
O. Tracy, the president of the Water
Users' association of the pioneer gov
ernment project at Carlsbad, where
complete success has been achieved
tinder the reclamation law. The quota
this elate is asked to contribute to
forward tho movement is but $2,000
which tho legislature, if need be. may
well provide at the probable extra ses
sion. If congress bo not willing to
provide liberally for the reclamation
of the now almost useless domain
then the challenge from Governor
Larrazolo to the federal government
to redeem the lnnds or turn them over
to the states that will do so. if given
the areas as a basis for securing the
requisite funds, will become more
emphatic.
Two million dollars go Into Okla
homa's school fund annually as reve
nue from oil lands. Let the teachers
of New Mexico take hope! A begin
ning has been made here with about
one-twentieth of revenue from leased
lands, that Oklahoma gets from roy
alties, bonuses and leases, even before
this state has any commercial supply
of oil.

would urge approval of the plans al
ready proposed to the congress by the
secretary of agriculture, to secure the
essential facts required for the proper
study of this question, through the
proposed enlarged programs for farmi
management studies and crop estl-l
mates. I would urge, also, the con
tinuance of federal participation In
the building of good roads, under the
terms of existing law and under, the
direction of present agencies; the
need of further action on tho part of
the states and the federal government
to preserve and develop our forest re
sources, especially through the prao-i
tlce of better forestry methods on pri
vate holdings and the extension of the
publicly owned forests; better sup
port for country schools nnd the more
definite direction of their courses of
study along lines related to rural
problems; and fuller provision for
sanitation In rural districts and the
building up of needed hospital and
medical facilities In these localities.
Perhaps the way might be cleared for
many of tnese desirable reforms by a
fresh, comprehensive Survey made of
rural conditions by a conference com
posed of representatives of the fnrm
ers and of the agricultural agencies
responsible for leadership.
Political Restlessness.
"I would call your attention to the
widespread condition of political rest
lessness In. our body politic. The
causes- of this unrest, while various
and complicated, are superficial rath
er than deep-seated. Broadly they
arise from, or are connected with the
failure on the part of our government
to arrive speedily at a just and per
manent peace permitting return to
normal conditions, from the transfu
sion of radical theories from seeth
ing European centers pending such
delay, from heartless profiteering re
sulting in the increase of the cost, of
living, and lastly from the machina
tions of passionate and malevolent
agitators. With the return to normal
conditions this unrest will rapidly dis
appear. In the meantime It does much
evil. It seems to me that in dealing
with this situation congress should
not be impatient or drastic, but should
seek rather to remove the causes. It
should endeavor to bring our country)
back speedily to a peace basis, with
ameliorated living conditions Under
the minimum of restrictions upon per
sonal liberty that Is consistent with
our reconstruction problems. Ana it
should arm the federal government
with power to deal In its criminal
courts with those persons who by Vio
lent methods wcnld abrogate our time
tested Institutions. With the free ex
pression of. opinion and with the ad
vocacy of orderly political change,
however fundamental, there must De
no interference, but toward passion
and 'Hnalevolence, tending to Incite
crime and Insurrection under guise of
political evolution, there should be no
leniency. Legislation to this end has
been recommended by the attorney
general and 'should be enacted. In
this direct connection I would call
your attention to my recommenda
tions on August 8. pointing out legis
lative measures which "would be ef
fective in controlling and bringing
down the present cost of living, which
contributes so largely to this unrest.
On only one of these recommenda
tions has the congress acted. If the
government's campaign is to be effec
tive. It is necessary that the otner
steps suggested should be acted on at
once.
would Extend Food Control.
I renew and strongly urge the
necessity of the extension of the ores
ent food control act as to the period
of time in which it shall remain in
operation. The attorney-general has
submitted & bill providing for an ex
tension of this act for a period of six
months. As it now stands It Is limited
in ODeration to the period of the war
and becomes inoperative upon the
formal proclamation of peace, it is
imperative that it should be extended
at once. The department of justice
has built up extensive machinery for
the purpose of enforcing its provi
sions; ftll of which must be abandoned
upon the conclusion Of peace unless
the provisions of thin act are ex
tended. - '
VJDurlng this period the congress
will have an opportunity to make
similar, permanent provisions and
regulations with regard to all goods
destined for Interstate commerce and
to exclude them from interstate ship
ment, if the requirements of tne law
are not complied with. Some such
regulation is imperatively necessary.
Tho abuses that nave grown up in the
manipulation of prices by the wltn
holding of foodstuffs. and other nec
essaries of life cannot otherwise be ef
fectively prevented. There Can be no
doubt of either the necessity or the
legitimacy of such measures.
Public MuHt i nac-stand.
"As I pointed out in my last mes
sage, publicity can accomplish & great
deal .in this campaign. The aims or
the government must be clearly
hrnno-ht in the attention of the con
suming public, civlo organizations and
state official, who are in a position
tn lend, their assistance to our efforts.
You have made available funds with
which to carry on this campaisn, but
there is no, provision in the law au
thorizing their expenditure for the
purpose of makmg the public fully
informed about the efforts of tne gov
eminent.- .Specific recommendations
has been made by the attorney-gener
al In this regard. J would strongly
urge upon you its Immediate adoption,
as It constitutes one or tne preumi
nary steps to this campaign.
"I also renew my recommendation
that the congress pass a law regulat
ing cold Storage as it is regulated, lor
example,- by the laws of the state of
Ne Jersey, which limit the time Our
lug jfhtch koods maj,', be keyt in start
age, prescribe the method of, pos
ing of them-If kept beyond thet per
mitted period and require that good
released from storage shall in all
cases bear the date of their receipt.
It would materially add to the service
ability of the law, for the purpose we
now have In view, If it were also pre
scribed that all goods released from
storage for interstate shipment should
have plainly marked upon each pack
age the .selling or market price at
which they went Into storage. By this
means tho purchaser would always be
able to loarn what profits stood be
tween him and the producer or the
wholesale dealer:
Wants Prices Known.
"I would also renew my recommen
dation that all goods destined for In
terstate commerce should in every
case, where their former package
makes it possible, be plainly marked
with the price at which they left the
nands or the producer.
"We should formulate a law requir
ing a federal license of all corpora
tions engaged in Interstate commerce
and embodying In the license, or in
the conditions under which it Is to be
Issued, specific regulations designed
to secure competitive selling and pre
vent unconscionable profits in the
method of marketing. Such a law
would afford a welcome opportunity
to effect other much needed reforms
in the business of interstate shipment
and In the methods of corporations
which are engaged in it; but for the
moment I confine my recommenda
tions to the object immediately in
hand, which is to lower the cost of
living.
i Must Improve Labor.
"No one who has observed the
march of events in the last year can
fail to note the absolute need of a
definite program to brinj about an
improvement in the. conditions of la
bor. There can bo no settled condi
tions leading to increased production
and a reduction in the cost of living
if labor and capital ate to be nntag
onists instead of partners. Sound
thinking and an honest desire to serve
the Interests of the whole nation, as
distinguished from the Interests of a
class, must be applied to the solution
of this great anil pressing problem
The failure of other nations to con
sider this matter In a vigorous way
has produced bitterness and Jealousies
and antagonisms, the food of radical
ism. The only way to keep men from
agitating against grievances Is to re
move the grievances. An unwilling
ness even to discuss these matters pro
duces only dissatisfaction and gives
comfort to the extreme elements in
our country, which endeavor to stir
un disturbances In order to provoke
governments to embark upon a course
of retaliation and repression. Tne
seed of revolution is repression. The
remedy for these things must not be
negative In character. It must be
constructive. It must comprehend
the general Interest. Tho real anti
dote for the .tinresj which manifests
Itself is not suppression but a deep
consideration of the wronss that be
set our national life and the applica
tion of a remedy.
Must Deiti(K'rati.e Ijabor.
"Congress has already shown its
willingness to deal with these indus
trial wrongs by establishing the
eight-hour day as the standard in
every field of labor. It has sought
to find a way to, prevent child labor.
It has served the Whole country by
leadijg the way In developing the
means of preserving and safeguarding
lives and health In dangerous indoM
tils It mt'st now help l.i the diffi
cult task ot finding a method that
will bring about a genuine democra
tization of industry, based upon th
full recognition of the right Of those
who work, m whatever rank to par
tlcipate In some organio way In every
decision which directly affects their
welfare. It is with this purpose in
mind that I called conference to
meet In Washington December 1 to
consider these problems in all their
hrosrl asnects. with the lde of bring
ing about a better understanding be
tween these two Interests.
"The great unrest throughout the
world, out of which has emerged a
demand for an immediate considera
tion of the differences between capita!
and labor, bids us nut our own house
in order. Frankly, there can be no
Dermanent and lasting eettkments on
tween capital and labor which do not
recognize the fundamental concep'
for which labor has been struggling
through the years. The whole world
gave its recognition and endorsement

to these fundamental purposes In the
hague of nations The Matesme i
gathered at Versailles recognized the
fact that world stability could not be
had, by reverting to industrial stand
ards and conditions against whlcn
the average workman or the woriJ
lad revolted. It is therefore the task
of the statesmen of this new day o
chance and to readjustment to world
conditions, and to seek to bring about.
thrtugh legislation, conditions tnai
will mean the ending of age-long an
tagonisms between capital and labor
and that will hopefully lead to the
building up of a comradeship whlcn
will result not only In greater con
tentment among the mass of work
men, but also bring about a greater
prodrfMlon and a greater prosperity
to business Itself. ,.
Labor's .lust IxmandH.
"To analyze the particulars In the
demands of labor is to admit tho
Justice of their complaint In many
matters that lie at their basis. The
workman demands an adequate wage
sufficient to permit him to live in
comfort, unhampered by the fear of
poverty and want in his old age. tie
demands the right to live and the
right to work amidst sanitary sur
roundings, both In home and in work
shop, surroundings that develop and
do not retard his own health and well
being; and the right to provide for
his children's wants in the matter of
health and education. In other
words, it is his desire to make the
conditions ot his life and the lives ot
those dear to him tolerable and easy
to bear.
"The establishment of the principles
regarding lhbor laid down In the cove
nant of the league of nations offers us
the way to industrial peace and concilia
tion. No other road lies open to us.
Not to pursue this one is longer to in
vite enmities, bitterness, and antag
onism which In the end only lead to
Industrial and social disaster. The un
willing workman is not a profitable
servant. An employe whose Industrial
life is hedged about by hard and, un
just conditions, which he did not cre
ate and over which he has no control,
lacks that fine spirit of enthusiasm
and volunteer effort which are the
necessary ingredients -pf a great pro
ducing entity. Let us be frank about
this solemn matter. The evidences Df
worldwide unrest which manifest
themselves in violence throughout the
world bid Us pause and consider the
means to be found to stop the spread
of this contagiOuB thing before it saps
the very vitality of the nation itself.
Do we gain strength by withholding
the remedy? Is It not the business of
statesmen to treat these manifesta
tions of unrest which meet us on every
hand as evidences of an economic dis
order and to apply constructive reme
dies wherever necessary, being sure
that in the application of the remedy
we touch not the vital tissues of our
industrial and economic life? There
can be no recession of the tide of un
rest until constructive Instrumentali
ties are set up to stem that tide.
RJj;lit to Collectively Bargain.
"Governments must recognize the
right of men to collectively bargain
for humane objects that have at their
base the usual protection and welfare
of those engaged in all industries. La
bor must not longer be treated as a
commodity. It must be regarded as
the activity of human beings pos
sessed of deep yearnings and desires.
The business man gives his best
thought to the repair and replenish
ment of his machinery, so that its use
fulness will not be impaired and its
power to produce may always be at Its
height and kept In full vigor and mo
tion. No less regard ought to be paid
to the human machine, which after all
propels the machinery of the world
and is the great dynamic force that
lies back of all industry and progress.
Return to the old standards of wage
and industry In employment are un
thinkable. Tho horrible tragedy of
war which has just ended and which
hag brought the world to the verge
ot chaos and disaster would be In vain
If there should ensue a return to the
conditions of the past. Europe Itself,
whence has come the unrest whish
now holds the world at bay, is an ex
ample of standpatism in these vital
human matters which America will
accept as an example, not to be fol-
lowed but studiously to be avoided.
Europe made labor the differential,
and the price of it all is enmity and
antagonism and prostrated Industry.
The right to labor to live in peace and
comfort must be recognized by gov
ernments and America should be the
first to ly the foundations upon
which industrial peace shall bo built.
Rights of Capital.
"Labor not only is entitled to an
adequate wage, but capital should re
ceive a reasonable return upon its
Investment and is entitled to protec
tion at the hands of the government
In every emergency. No government
worthy of the name can "play" these I
elements against each other, for there j
is a -mutuality of interest between
them which the government must!
seek to express and to safeguard at
all oosts.
"The rights of individuals to strike
Is inviolate and ought not to be Inter
fered with by any process of govern
ment, but there Is a predominant
right, and that Is the right of the
government to protect all of Hi peo
pie and to assert Its power and ma
jesty against the challenge of anr
class. The government," when It' as
serts that right, seeks not to antag
onize a class but simply to defend the
right of the whole people as against
the irreparable harm and Injury th.t
might be done by the attempt by any
class to usurp a power that only gov
ernment itself has a right to exercise
as protection to all.
'In the matter of International dis
putes which have led to war, states
men have sought to set up as a rem
edy arbitration for war, -Doe this
not point the way for the settlement
of industrial disputes by the estab
lishment of a tribunal, fair and Just
alike to all, which will settfc indus
trial disputes which In the past have
led to war and disaster? America,
witnessing the evil- consequences
which have followed out of such dis
putes between the contehdlng- forces,
must not admit itself Impotent to deal
with these matters by mean! of peace
ful processes. Surely there must be
some method of bringing- together in
a council of peace and amy these
two great Interests, out of which will
come a happier dayiot peace and co
operation, a dav that will make for
more comfort and happiness In living
and a more tolerable-condition among
all classes of men. Certainly human
intelligence can devise some accept
able tribunal for adjusting the differ
ences between capital and labor.
Hour of Trial for America. - '
"This is the hour of test and trial
for America. By her prowess and
strength, and the indomitable cour.
Rge of her soldiers, she demonstrated
her power to vindicate on ' foreign
battlefields her conception ot 'liberty
and Justlre. Let not her Influence as

bor be weakened and her own failure

concern be proclaimed to the world.
