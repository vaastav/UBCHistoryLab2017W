THE FIFXY-FIBST CONGRESS.
Beginning of the Second Session To-
Day The President', message No
Program Mapped Out fortne Week
Probability of a Consultation of
Republican Senator.
"Washington, D. C, Nov. 30. The sec
ond session of the Fifty-first congress will
begin at noon to-morrow. - Ab soon as the
senate and house are called to order a joint
committee will be appointed to notify the
president that congress is ready , to do
business, and in response his annual mes
sage will immediately be sent to the oapi
tol and laid before both houses. .The read
ing of the message will probably consnme
the legislative day of Monday, following
the induction of new congressmen into
office.
In neither house has the program of
busineBs for the week been definitely deter
mined. The senate will probably resume
consideration of the bill .providing for the
transfer of the revenue 5sarine service to
to the navy department, which is pending
morning hour business. If the calendar
routine is followed - the Edmunds land
court bill may next be considered, and
should Senator Blair reach the capitol dur
ing the week he will., doubtless make an
effort to secure action upon the house bill
for the adjustment of eight hour claims.
There is a strong impression, however,
that there will be a consultation of repub
lican senators early in the week to con
sider an order of business, and the result
may be a wide departure from the routine
program.
Xn the House the pension uppropnatlon
bill will be reported by the committee on
appropriations and pushed to a nnal dis
position. The democratic members have
prepared themselves to take advantage of
the latitude allowed in general debate on
an appropriation bill, and will doubtless
stir up their political adversaries to the
point of reply by severe criticisms of the
majority and allusions to the results of
the recent elections, it is possible that
an "urgency deficiency bill" covering de
ficits in the current year's appropriations
for the census and other bureaus may
also be presented to the house during the
week. It any time remains undisposed
of the committee on rules will allot it to
committees in charge of such important
pending measures as the majority may
determine to give precedence.
THE INDIAN SITUATION.
. T1HK IRISH EN VOTS.
Their Tlewa on Idr. Parnell'a mani
festo Cabled to London nr. mora
lor Take Exceptions to Some of
Mr. Parnell'si Statement.
Chicaoo.Nov. 80. The views of the en
voys in America, excepting Timothy Har
rington, was cabled to-night -to London.
The following is apart of the document
To Justin McCarthy, 11. P., vice-chairman
of the Irish parliamentary party:
Our sense of the matchless genius of Mr. Par
neU as a leader of the imperishable services he
has rendered to the Irish cause, of the courage,
integrity and splendid success with which he has
led our people for ten years and the tie of com
radeship and personal respect and affection,
which for years bound us to him, nave made us
suspend to the latest possible moment our judg
ment against hi further leadership. The obli
gation to expresss that judgment is to all of us
the most painful duty of our lives. No earthly
consideration could have moved us to our de
termination except the solemn conviction that
we are driven to choose between Mr. Parcell and
.the destruction of our country1 cause. Bo pain
fully alive were we to all that might be involved
in the loss of euoh a leader that we eagerly co
operated with our colleagues in every effort to
retain his influence in our counsels. The mani
festo which Mr. Parnell has just issued cute us
off from the last hopes to which we clung. Anxi
ous to avoid a" word that might embitter
any controversy we shall not dwell up
on the cruel injustice with which he
treats the members of the party that has follow
ed him with a loyalty and affection such as no
leader ever experienced before. His recollection
of their fealty to him in many an hour of trial
might well have saved them from imputation
that any section of them could have allowed
their Integrity to be sapped by liberal wire
pullers, nor would we do more than enter a pro
test against this violation of constitutional prin
ciple in flouting by anticipation the decision of
the elected representative of the people from
whose votes the chairman of the parliamentary
party receives his authority, and restoring to a
vague general appeal over their heads. Con
siderations like these we should readily have
waved in the interest of national solidarity but
the method in which ignoring the origin of the
present calamitous situation Mr. Parnell endeav
ored to fasten the responsibility for it upon
Messrs. Gladstone and af orley compels us to dis
associate ourselves in the strongest manner from
an imputation which we believe to be reckless
ana unjust.
. - We view with abhorrence the attacks thaUhave 1
been made on Mr. Parnell by his public and pri
vate enemies under cover of his present difficul
ties. To attacks of this kind addressed to a man
of a proud and strong spirit we attribute many
of the terrible dangers with which Ireland u
threatened and we fear that they may do the
further mischief of diverting the minds of many
people from grave national to purely personal
issues m we natural resentment oi an ungener
ous attack on a great leader in an hour of stress
and disaster.
But, while making every possible allowance for
Mr. Parnell's feeling on this score, we consider it
unjust to the English people and lamentable from
the point of view of international good feeling to
describe as-English wolves howling for bis de
struction those who have not been able to bring
themselves to the same view to which gratitude
and the necessity for union impelled MrParnell's
own colleagues and countrymen. The plea of
Mr. Parnell that Mr. Gladstone's letter involves a
claim to dictate to the Irish party, and thereby
strike at the independence of that party as a
strictly Irish national body, would be . one calcu
lated to inspire every Irish nationalist with
alarm were it not an obvious fallacy.
The Irish party was formed for the purpose of
winning home rule for Ireland. To do it in the
interest of English parties would be an invasion
of the independence of the Irish party and would,
we believe, be repelled by no more sternly than
by our colleagues and ourselves, who are now in
opposition to mr. rarneu. nut tne very nasi or
our independent alliance with the liberal party is
the adoption by them of the program for which
the Irish party was formed and the recognition
that it must be the first business of a liberal cab
inet to realize that program.
Whatever differences of opinion may exist as to
the haste with which Mr. Gladstone's letter was
communicated to the public it was obviously not
nis nostuity to nome ruie, Dut nis earnest aesire
to save it from disaster that prompted Mr. Glad
stone to write his letter. We deplore that diffi
culties of Mr. Gladstone's position are not frank
ly recognized by Mr. Parnell and that, on the
contrary .friendly private communications com
munication obviously made with a view of
smoothing the passage of the home ruie bill
have been made the basis of insinuations of
treachery to the Irish cause. Ey his convictions.
again and again expressed, that home rule to be
effective must be such a measure as will satisfy
the Irish pdople. Mr. Gladstone is bound to a
full and ample measure of self-government to
Ireland. To offer any other scheme would be
not only an act of incredible business, but of in
credible folly and we emphatically separate
ourselves irom any sucn cnarge against mr.
Gladstone.
We lay those views respectfully before aU our
colleagues of the Irish parliamentary party in the
earnest belief that a decisive vote on their part
will deliver Ireland from the fearful anxiety
wuicn now overnangs ner people.

MR. UOBXET'S STATEMENT.
London, Nov. 30. Mr. Morely writes
to the press as follows: The manifesto of
Mr. Parnell contains two or three state
ments affecting me which I desire without
loss of time to correct:
First I made no sort of attempt to fetter Mr.
Parnell's action with reference to the land bill.
He agreed wit h me in all our conversations that
the bill ought to be opposed as omitting the prin
ciples of local control and for other reasons spe
cified in his speech of April SI. The only ques
tion was as to tne rorrn or mouon ior me rejec
tion of the hill.
Second Mr. Parnell' imputes to me In our con
versation of November 10, five days before the
proceedings in court were uegun, a remarKBOie
proposal with the object of absorbing the Irish
nartv into English politics bv means of office.
made no proposal. It was natural that in a free.
confidential discussion of the possible future
should wish to make sure for Mr. Gladstone's In
formation that Parnell still held to his self-deny-
ing declaration ot 1880. His answer to my in
auirv was what I fullv anticipated.
Third Mr. Parnell's account of what passed on
the same occasion on the subiect of evicted ten
ants on the plan of campaign estates is wholly
incorrect. I observed that some direct action
might become necessary. Though I foresaw diffi
culties In the way of legislation. i;never said that
l or any oi my colleagues naa lormeu any con
clusions against legislation. I never said or hint
ed that it would be impossible for an Irish par
liament to do anything in the matter. 1 did say
that, whether by direct or indirect action. Ab to
Tipperary, there is all the difference between a
sensible perception of difficulties and the despair
wnicn air. rarneu ascribes to me.

London, Not. 80. Mr. Parnell, by tele
graph, invited those of his colleagues who
were favorable to his retention in the lead
ership to meet him Saturday at the West
minster Palace hotel. Twenty-four of
those invited met Mr. Parnell, and togeth
er they discussed the situation. Mr. Par
nell informed those present of the rela
tions between himself and the liberal lead
ers and expressed a determination to fight
to the last.
Another canvass of the party was made
yesterday for the purpose of forecasting the
result of the vote to be taken regarding
Mr. Parnell' retention. It shows that
Messrs. Justin,Huntley,McCarthy, McNeil,
McKenna and Tnite are now pledged
against Parnell and Tully, James P. O'Qor
uian. Mahon and Clancy for him. It is es
timated that forty-eight members of the
party will vote against Mr. Parnell and
twenty-four for him. The Totes of seven
ar considered doubtful. This estimate
does not include the delegates now in
America.
Archbishop Croke has telegraphed to
Mr. Justin McCarthy that he is strongly in
favor of the retirement of Mr. Parnell.
- Archbishop Walsh to-day telegraphed to
Mr. William Martin Murphy, M. P., for
the St. Patrick division of Dublin, that the
hierarchy would meet dn Wednesday next
to consider the situation. The archbishop
says: "We have been slow to aot,trusting
that the party will act manfully. Our con
siderate alienee ana reserve is Deing ais

Croke's telegram will make further misrep
resentation impossible."
' ARCHBISHOP WALSH'S VIIW8.
Dublin, Not. 80. In an . interview
Arohbishop Walsh, referring to his recent
letter on the Parnell difficulty, says: "The
letter was guarded because Mr. Parnell had
not then spoken. Bnt now his manifesto
enables me to speak more plainly. Unless
Mr. Parnell clears himself of the charge of
adultery the party taking or retaining him
as its leader will not find the support, co
operation or confidence of the Irish bish
ops. Mr. Parnell's breach of Mr. Glad
stone's confidence is blamable." - Aroh
bishop Walsh speaks only of the moral
anrwi of the manifesto, savins that he
leaves its political bearings to the Irish
members.
Chicago, Not. 30. From an indirect
nnnrse information was obtained that Mr.
Harrington declined to sign the manifesto
on personal grounds.
He is said to have stated his position
thus: "My judgment is against Parnell, but
my heart is with him."
A report generally credited gained circu
lation toward midnight that Harrington
would separate to-morrow from the five
comrades with whom he no longer agreed.

At last the Tale campus has been the
scene of a fir of considerable extent whioh
was not a celebration in honor of some
athletio victory. Saturday evening about
9:45 o'clock as Edward B. Mowbray, a
sophomore, was passing down the campus
he saw flames issuing from the upper win
dowa of South Middle. He gave the alarm
and soon the fire engines were on the
oene. By that time the upper room in the
northwest corner was one mass of .m
and from all the windows msimnn of amok
and fire belched forth.
The fire was a stubborn one to fisht and
before subdued had broken out in the at
tic, Where it was extremely difficult to eet
at. Several streams of water had the effect
of giving the entire building a pretty good
drenching.
wnue tne nremen were battling the
flame the students were working like
beavers getting their effects out of the
range of danger. Table, desks, chairs,
bedsteads, - mattresses, lamps, in short,
everything that goes to furnish a student's
room, found their way to the eround in a
very short space of time. In some of the
rooms the students became excited and
commenced throwing articles of furniture
rrom tne windows in a most reckless fash
ion. Tables, chairs and brio-a-brae came
irashing to the ground, breaking into
pieces from the long fall. This reckless
ness, however, was soon checked by the
cooler-headed ones and the work of carry
ing ont furniture and effects from the
threatened rooms was continued.
students were rushing about trying to find!
this or that article. One exclamation heard
from one was : "Say, fellows, have you

It is believed bv the nremen that they most

As a result of the fire and water about
fifteen or twenty students were rendered

students, were deserted in a twinkling.

A Sermon Against Sensational Jour
nalism Close of tbe Trinity H. E.
Revival Otber Notes.
Rev. Ur. Squires, of the Church of the
Messiah, delivered a lecture last evening
on slander, to a fair-sized audience. No
thief, he said, was to b greater feared In
the journey of life than slander. Two
fold injury is wrought, equally with the
slanderer and slandered. Slander, or gos
sip, which is embodied in it, unfortunately
seems at the present day to be on the in
crease. The speaker branched off into a
lively denunciation of some of the methods
of the sensational modern press. He
criticised severely the evils of sensational
journalism, including sensational report
ing, and olosed with an earnest appeal to
his hearers to turn a deaf ear to the voice
of gossip and slander.
AT THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH.
- Yesterday was the annual Sunday
school day at the First Baptist church.
Money for the running expenses for the

Last night the revival at Trinity il. E.

tion. The services yesterday were of un
usual interest all day long. The church
was as usual entirely inadequate to accom
modate the large orowds. Dr. MoChesney
preached a sermon of telling power at the
morning service. It is thought that Mr.
Harrison will go next 10 a new xora
church to carry on his evangelistic labors:
Dr. MoChesney spoke words of passionate
praise of the energetio little worker. Ser
vices will be held at 6:80 and 7:30 o'clock.
To-morrow night a jubilee sermon will be
preached by Bishop . Andrews . of New
York.

Ths master, said he. lay down for us
