TUESDAY EVENING. DEC. 4, 18 ?4.
About the only one thing &s yet
definitely determined upon in respec
of the proceedings of the present ses?
sion of Congress,seems to be an attempt
to tax the people of the whole country
one hundred million dollars, nominally
for the purpose of digging a canal
through the foreign territory of Nica?
ragua, "incidentally," of course, for the
benefit of the members of the canal
company and those engaged in effecting
the success of the scheme. The present
democratic Congress doesn't command
the people's highest respect, but if it
shall pass a bill for any such purpose
as that referred to, it will certainly
go down as unhonored, as un?
wept and unsung. There are
billions of idle capital in the North
now, and if the proposed canal be as
sure a success as its advocates say it
will be, the owners of that capital are
afforded an excellent opportunity for
investing some of it safely and profita?
bly. Why the poor people of the coun?
try, who will derive none of its possible
benefits.should be still further taxed to
build it, can not be satisfactorily ex?
plained. _____________
One ok the wisest things in the Pres?
ident's message is his recommendation
that steps be taken at once by which
the United States shall withdraw from
their engagements with Great Britain
and Germany in respect of the govern?
ment of Samoa. Entangling foreign al?
liances never did and never can do this
country any good, and this government
has all it can well do in providing for
the welfare of its own pillaged people,
without bothering itself with the affairs
of other countries. It3 interference
with Hawaii resulted in ignominious
ridicule, and proved the wisdom of
General Washington's advice. The
sooner it withdraws from the Berlin
treaty the better.
As the ineffectiveness of State troops
in certain sorts of emergencies was
demonstrated last summer, the Presi?
dent's recommendation of an increase
in the army should be adopted. Though
the mobs hooted and jeered at the mili?
tia and refused to obey their orders,
they always ran or slunk away at the
appearance of the regulars. In time of
peaca the army is always subservient
to the civil power, but the militia can
not be relied upon to take part against
their own neighbors and acquaintances,
no matter how riotous they may be.
TtfE consensus of interviews, pri?
vate and public, with democratic mem?
bers of Congress since their return to
Washington is to the effVct that the pri?
mal cause of the refusal of democratic
voters to go to the polls last month was
their disapproval of the course pursued
by the man they elected President. That
course put the party on the train of dis?
satisfaction and discontent, and though
other things speeded it as it progressed
on its disastrous way, but for that it
never would have started.
The president of Tufts College, to
which young women and young men
are admitted on terms of full equality,
recently upbraided an unidentified fe?
male student for having been seen to
kiss a male student after dark. If the
president had keenereyes the poor unfor?
tunate girl referred to would not be the
only one upon whom he showered his
condemnation. But such is one of the
natural beauties of co-education.
The President stands by his "con?
viction," that while the duty on sugar
should remain, except the one-tenth of
one per cent, on that imported from
countries that pay a bounty on its ex?
port, every cent of duty on Virginia
coal should be taken off. But the
President's "convictions" have as little
influence with the present democratic
as they will have wite the coming te
publican Congress.
Repined sugab is twice protected,
once from all countries, and once from
those that pay a bounty on its export.
But notwithstanding all this its manu?
facturers close their works and say they
can not aflbrd to run them. Could
there possibly bo a more, easily learned
lesson against the asserted advantages
of protection?
FROM WASHINGTON.
[Correspondence of the Alexandria Garotte.]
Washington, Dec 4, 1894.
The fate of all tariff legislation and
especially that contemplated in the
four so-called "pop-gun" tariff bills and
the measure intended to remedy the
error in the alcohol clause of the tariff
bill, was practically sealed by the dis?
cussion had by the Senate finance com?
mittee this morning. The discussion
was confined almost exclusively to tar?
iff, the currency scheme of the Presi?
dent receiving only casual reference.
Mr. Harris said he would like to see
the sugar schedule modified, but in
view of the statements made to Con?
gress by Secretary Carlisle he could not
advocate any step that would reduce
the revenues of the government. Mr.
Jones was desirous of having the dif?
ferential sugar duty expunged, but ad?
mitted the inability to carry out that
?desire. Mr. Voorhees, chairman of the
committee, is understood to have taken
ptroag ground against any more tariff
legislation this session. He declared
himself opposed to any tamperi g with
the present tariff law as it passed tho
Senate. He wanted it to stand and
let the people have the chance of
testiug it. The republicans were
of the same opinion, and said as
the democrats bad passed the bill
aguinst their protests the party niiirfl
stand or fall by the legislation however
pernicious it proved to be. It 'vas ap?
parent that anv effort to take up the
supplemfn'ai blls would be the signal
for the opening of the whole tariff
question, and the democratic members
of the committee admitted, it is said,
that they were powerless to do any
thing. The attitude of the republicans
is indicated by the amendments that
were oflered at the close of. the last
session to the "remedial" measures,
one of which re-enacts the McKinley
sugar bounty as an amendment to the
bill which proposes to correct the error
found in Ibo alcohol clause of the pre?
sent act. As the republicans in tho
Senate have a majority in favor of the
.-ugar bounty there could be but one
result in calling up this bill for action.
The discussion in the finance commit?
tee room it is believed will have an
important bearing upon the action of
the democratic caucus this afternoon in
outlining the order of business for the
next few weeks.
A bill in equity was filed in the Dis?
trict Supreme Court to-day by the
Anglo American Savings and Loan As?
sociation of New York city against
Harvey Spalditig and two others of this
city, asking for a foreclosure of the
mortgage which the association holds
on certain property of Spalding's on ac?
count of a loan 'which he negotiated
with it, amounting to $30,000, ?29,000
of which remains unpaid.
The democratic Senators went into
caucus shortly after the Senate adjourn?
ed. There is every indication of the
cancus failing to accomplish definite
results as the discussion was almost
entirely devoted to a proposition to
change the rules. This was precipitat?
ed by a resolution instructing the com?
mittee on rules to make changes pro?
viding for closuro, the counting of a
quorum, etc., offered by Mr. Daniel, of
Virginia. The discussion at 2:30 had
been fruitless in results, as no vote bad
been taken.
The president and directors of
Georgetown College, D. C, to-day is?
sued a regulation, adopted in faculty
meeting held this morning, prohibiting
their students from playing football
with teams, whether collegiate or
other, from outside the college until the
character and rules of the game shall
have been radically modified so as to
preclude with reasonable certainty all
danger of serious casualties.
The fact that President Cleveland j
has pardoned General Swaime, though j
President Arthur demanded a longer
term of imprisonment for him, is the
subject of some comment here.
Another attack is to be m;ide by the
District government upon the wharf
owners of this city for occupying prop?
erty belonging to the District.
The President to-day commuted
to light imprisonment the sentences of
Michael Knightou and William Dow?
ney, for assault in tho District of Co?
lumbia.
As soon as Representative Tucker
of Virginia reaches here he will
endeavor to have the postoffice at
old Appomattox C. H., in his district,
given a less irritating name than "Sur?
render," though that name was sug?
gested by the people served with mail
nt that office and was recommended by
the postmaster there.
Secretary Carlisle, in his report sent
to Congress to-day, recommends that
power be conferred* upon the Secretary
of the Treasury to negotiate loans at a
lower rate of interest and for a shorter
time than are now allowed, and ex?
presses his conviction "that the interests
o the country require such changes in
legislation as will disconnect the gov?
ernment entirely from the business of
issuing or reissuing circulating notes,
and thus relieve its fiscal departm-nt
from the periodical demands upon its
resources,which under the existing sys?
tem must continue to disturb the fi?
nancial and general business aflairs of
the people."
Congressman Wise, of Virginia, was
in his seat in the House to-day. He
says the only bill the commerce com?
mittee, of which he is chairman, will
attempt to push through at this session,
will be the one for the Nicaraguan
cunal, and that he hasn't much hope
even of its success.
The consensus of opinion at the Capi?
tol to-day in respect of the President's
message is that its recommendations
are worthy only of ridicule or entire
disregard.
Representative Catchings, of the
House committee on rules, says he has
no idea of what Congress will do this
session except to pass the regular ap?
propriations bills.
The act granting the right of way
through the Arlington reservation to
the Mount Vernon Railroad Company,
which passed both houses at the last
session, but too late to be considered
by the War Department, was engrossed
yesterday evening and will be sent to
the President to-day for his approval.
He will refer it to Secretary Lamont.
A gentleman from South Dakota here
to-day says that at the late election
there the whole support of the adminis?
tration was thrown in favor of the re?
publican ticket. Whether the reason
was to defeat the populists or not he
doesn't eay, but asserts that what he
states is a fact.
Rear Admiral Walker has been
unanimously elected President of the
Light House Board,to succeed Admiral
Greer, detached.
Secretary Mclntyre, of the Virginia '
Jockey Club, says there couldn't be
better racing weather than the present,
but that as his club is the youngeft
member of the New York association.it
couldn't aflbrd to secede. He says the j
Virginia club will resume operations I
on the first of next March, and will
then be more acceptable to the public
than ever.
Judge McComas, of the District Crim?
inal Court, to-day rendered his deci?
sion as to the demurrers filed By Capt.
Henry W. Howgate, the ex-United
States Signal Officer, to the indictment
charging him with forgery and embez?
zlement. The demurrers as to forgery
are sustained, but those in regard to
embezzlement are overruled. As the
Howgate case now stands, there are no
forgery indictments against the defend?
ant, but two sets of indictments charg?
ing him with embezzlement. It is be?
lieved that that the case will be tried
on the last indictments, though Judge
McComas has sustained the old ones.
It is said that no new forgery indict?
ments will now be presented against
Captain Howgate until after a decision
is reached in the trial of the embezzle?
ment cases. It is possible also, that
the forgery cases may not again come
up in court.

Death or Hon. B. Johnson bar?
bour.?Hon. B. Johnson Barbour died
Sunday, near Barboursville, in Orange
county, at the age of seventy-four, and
his funeral occurred from his home yes?
terday evening. Some weeks ago he
sustained a fall in Charlottesville, from
effects of which he did not recover en?
tirely, hut it is probable that tho imme?
diate cause of his death was paralysis.
H -longed to a family long concerned
in public affairs in this State, his father,
James Barbour, haviug been Governor
of Virginia, United States Senator and
Minister to England, and his uncle a
justice of the Supreme Court of the
United States. He was gifted as an
orator and writer and a talented con?
versationalist. His talk sparkled with
anecdote and illustration and with a
dry wit peculiarly his own. Mr. Bar?
bour took great interest in the political
affairs of the State, though not an office
seeker, and was a whig under the old
regime, but was never actively engaged
in politics until after the war.
He was elected to Congress in 1SGG,
but was not allowed to take his seat,
as the State was still under reconstruc?
tion laws. In 1S7U he was re-elected as
a debt-payer to the Virginia Legisla?
ture, and sat for one year in the assem?
bly. His speeches whilst a member of
that house were marked for eloquence
?ind patriotism. He was a member of
the board of visitors of the University of
Virginia, and at one lime its rector.
He was also up to the time of his death
a member of the Miller board of trus?
tees of the University. Mr. Barbour
married a Miss Watson, of Richmond,
who survives him. He leaves five
children, two sons, the Hon. George S.
Barbour and Thomas Barbour. and
three daughters, one of whom is the
wife of Professor W. G. Christian, of the
University.
Aepkopriations for Rivers.?In
the book of estimates submitted to
Congress yesterday by the Treasury
Department liberal sums are asked for
the continuation of liver and harbor
improvements in Maryland and Vir
einia, among which are the following:
Improving Aquia creek, $15.000; con?
tinuing work on James river, $400,000;
improving Mataponi, $10,000; continu?
ing improvement to Nansemond, $50,.
000; completing improvement to Occo
quan creek, $25,000; improving Pamuu
key river, $5,000; continuing work on
the Rappahannock, $25,000; improving
Urbana creek, $7,000; completing im?
provement to York river, $95,050; im?
proving inland water route from Nor?
folk to Albemarle sound, through Cur
rituck sound, $36,667; Nomini creek,
completing improvement, $15,000;
Lower Machodoc creek, completing im?
provement, $9.000; Potomac river at
Washington, D. C, completing im?
provement, $531,365. Estimates are
submitted again this year for the erec?
tion of a lighthouse near Lower Cedar
Point, Potomac river, to replace the
structure destroyed by fire nearly two
years ago. In submitting the estimate
Secretary Carlisle states that the light
seems to indicate an important point
on the river, and that it is important
that the old structure be at once re?
placed. Its place is now poorly sup?
plied by a lens lantern. It is also urged
in the estimates that a new light sta?
tion be established on or near the shoal
ofTPointNo Point. Md., for which an
appropriation of $70,000 is asked. A
deviation from their sailing course
might carry vessels of heavy draught
on this dangerous shoal, and to warn
vessels of its location a light is said to
be urgently needed.
j FIFTY-THIRD CONGRESS.
Washington, Dec. 4.
senate.
The first bill passed at this session
was a somewhat remarkable one. It
was a House pension bill in favor of
one Mary Martin, and was reported
this morning by Mr. Gallinger from the
Senate committee on pensions. It con?
tains the unusual provision that the
pension is to cease "if the soldier re?
turns." The explanation was that the
man disappeared twenty years ago and
has not since been heard from.
Among the bills introduced by Mr.
Peffer was one "to provide a proper
disposition of the remains of deceased
members of the Senate and House of
Representatives who die at the capital
during the sessions of Congress." An?
other was to repeal that part of the re?
sumption act which provides for the
sale of bonds. And a third was to pro?
vide for the government control of
freight railroads.
Mr. Blanchard offered a resolution
instructing the committee on appropria?
tions to report au amendment to the
urgency deficiency bill appropriating
a sufficient amount to pay the sugar
bounty ou the sugar crop of ISOI under

for the present.
Mr. Lodge oflered resolutions which
were agreed to, calling on the Presi?
dent for the correspondence relating to
affairs at Bluefields, and calling on the
Secretary of the Navy for the reports or
letters of Rear Admiral Walker in re?
lation to the Sandwich Islands.
Mr. Vest offered a resolution for an
amendment to tho rules so as to allow
debate to be closed and the timo fixed
for taking a vote on any bill, resolution
or motion that shall have been debated
divers days amounting iu all to thirty.
It went over till to-morrow, with a no?
tice from Mr. Vest that he would then
submit remarks in support of it and
would ask action upon it.
A message having been received from
the House announcing the recent death
of Representative Wright, of Pennsyl?
vania, the Senate, on motion of Mr.
Quay, adjourned.
HOUSE.
Mr. Storer introduced a resolution,
which was adopted, extending until
the first session of the next Congress
the time in which the board of engi?
neers surveying proposed routes for
canals to conuect Lake Erie with the
Ohio river, under the provisions of the
river and harbor bill for the present
year.
A bill was passed appropriating
$20,000 for the dedication of the Chick
amauga and Chattanooga National
Park on November 19th and 20th, 1S95.
A bill providing for the establish?
ment of the Shiloh National Military
Park by the purchase of 3,000 acres of
the ground upon which that battle was
fought was taken up. It appropriates
$150,000, the money to be expended
under direction of the Secretary o!
War, its aflaira to be supervised by a
commission consisting of three com?
missioners, one from the Army of
the Tennessee, one from the Army of
the Ohio and one from the Army of the
Mississippi. The appropriation for car?
rying out the objects of the bill were
reduced from $1-50,000 to $75,000, and
as thus amended passed.
Mr. Richardson presented the con?
ference report on the bill passed at the
last session to regulate-the printing and
distribution of public documents.
Failed to Appear.?Miss Geraldine
Lightfoot, a pretty and accomplished
young lady, who went to Richmond re?
cently from Culpeper, was to have
been married Sunday night to Mr. Con
way Myers, a popular young man, and
formerly one of tho managers of the
Mozart Academy of Music of Rich?
mond. The wedding did not take
place because the groom-elect failed to
appear. The clergyman and quite a
number of friends assembled at the
house where Mis3 Lightfoot boarded,
but after waiting until a late hour the
guests and the preacher departed. Mr.
Myers was seen on the street about the
time that the wedding was to have oc?
curred. He sent no explanation so far
as learned. Miss Lightfoot is a native
of Culpeper. She will be remembered
as a witness in the trial of Howard
Schneider for murder in Washington.
Schneider had paid her attentions in
that city, and also visited her at her
parents' home in Culpeper, passing
himself off as a single man.
Saved From the Gallows.?Chat?
tanooga was to have been the scene of
a double hanging yesterday. But thirty
minutes before time for the execution
Governor Turney telegraphed Sheriff
Hyde that he had granted the doomed
men a respite until January 11, pending
an investigation for commutation of
sentence. All was in readiness for the
hanging. The men under sentence of
death are Buddy Wooten and George
Mapp, two young negroes, who on Jan?
uary 17, 1SU2, murdered Marion Ros<,
a well known saloon keeper, for the
purpose of robbery. The murder was a
mystery until Wooten was sent to the
work bouse on minor charges. Here
he made a confession to a fellow prison?
er, who reported it to the officers.
Hence the arrest for murder. Mapp is
only 17 years old.
Sugar.?Another cut of ? of a cent
per pound was made in refined sugar
prices in Philadelphia, yesterday, which
brought the card rate for granulated
down to 4J cents, and the actual net
price received by refiners to 3.86 cents
per pound. This is within t) of the low?

WILL BE CALLED SURREND] ...
Some time ago it was stated tl al tl 1
Fourth Assistant Postmastei Gen
had changed the name of the ] st Hi >
atAppomattox Courthouse, Appomat
tox county, to Surrender. Thi story
created a sensation, ami was heard
from all over the country, the general
ground taken bring that it was unwise,
to say the least, to make air. .
the name of an olliee so rich in histoi
association?, while the name Surrei .
was considered the worst p -: >. se?
lection that could have be
a selection in the worst taste. Old
soldiers from all over the countn
fought ou both sides in the
protested against this name, but there
was never any protest from the patrons
of the office, and the name was nol re?
stored to the old spot where one "? tl e
tracic scenes of the war occurred. In
1S'J2 the courthmise at Appoinattox
burned down, and when it vva ? 1
site was selected in the town caili 1] Ne?
braska, about three uii !?.???: away. Tl
place was well supplied with mails,
and was the point of supply fur an -
her of smaller postoffices foi several
miles around. There were several rail?
roads crossing Nebraska, mon ?
this was another reason for erecting the
courthouse in the town. When lite
courthouse was built there, in or?
der to keep iu line with a pe
nili..r custom that obtain- in
Virginia, it was decided, of course,
that the place containing the
courthouse should have the same name
as the county. As the name of the
county was Appomattox, it \*
ed to name the postofiice Ap] u
notwithstanding the fact that then -
an office already bearing thai name.
Consequently application was mad
the department asking thai the
be made, a thing that was
however, as long as tho oi l
tiuued to be called Appomattox.
people at Nebraska were instructed to
have the postmaster at App
apply to have the name of the old oll e
changed to something else, .-<? that be
name "Appomattox" would b
available for the office at N- braska.
The postmaster at Appomattox agn ed
to this, and applied to have tie
of the Appomattox ollice changed to
"Surrender.'' This was done,
outcry was raised that run:: from
to California. None of tin- people in
Virginia much interested, however,
seemed to care to have the programme
changed, and, consequently, there was
no kick from any of them, and the
change held good. Yesterday 1 lie
Pestoffice Department bestowed the
name of Appomattox on the spiigbtly
new neighbor. Nebraska, wbicl
henceforth be known as A]'
while the real Appomattox. three 11
away, will struggle along und
name "Surrender."' Thisactiom
department clinches the name 0
render" upon old Appomattox
will now bo impossible to r< store
its old name, as that name
another office. The action taken yes?
terday has been contemplated for me
