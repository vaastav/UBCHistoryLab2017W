THF FOREST REPUBLICAN.
J. C. WINK, - Editor 4 Proprietor.
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 13. IS99.
The Mormons who want bygones to be
bygones made mistake in sending a by
gone to Congress.
In every town entered by oor troops in
Luzon there are demonstrations of pub
lic rejoicing. The inhabitants are de
lighted to be rolioved from the rule of
thugs and bandits.
The President speaks of China as
"great field for American trade and en
tei prise." That strikes the business men
of America as a sound remark.
"The future government of the Philip
pines," says the message, "rests with the
Congress of the United States." If Con
gress does its part as well as the Presi
dent has done bis, all will be well.
The message reaches the people at a
moment whon the war in the Philppines
seems to be in the lost stage. Congress
may well congratulate the President on
having advanced the subject to this
point.
The action of the Republican majority
In the House of Representatives in adopt
ing the Reed rules shows that the major
ity means business, and that it intends to
fulfill to tlio best of its ability the pledg
es of the party.
Those antis who are quoting William
II. Seward, as an auti-expansionist bo
cause he opposed the annexation of Tex
as in the campaign of 1844, should go a
little slow. Seward opposed the annex
ation of Texas not because he was an anti
expansionist, but because be wa against
the acquisition of any more slave terri
tory. The purchase of Alaska later con
summated by Mr. Seward, showed his
attitude upon expansion.
The small record of business failures
throughout the United States continues
to annoy the spirits of those who would
seem to prefer seeing business depression
and panic under a Republican adminis
tration, than prosperity and activity,
even though they themselves share in it.
The failures for the week ending Decem
ber 2, 1809, according to Dun's Review,
were only 144, as against 281 for the by no
means unprosperous corresponding week
of 1898.
The Goebelites of Kentucky are
downed at last, their effort to steal the
Governorship having failed after a most
spirited and altogether unwarranted con
test. On Saturday morning last the elec
tion certificate of William S. Taylor was
signed by the election Commissioners
and he was declared to be Governor-elect
of Kentucky. The official figures of the
Vote filed with the Secretary of State Fin-
ley are: Taylor, 193,714; Goebel, 191,331.
Taylor's plurality 2,383.
The money in circulation in the United
States has increased 33 per cent, since Mr.
Bryan and his deluded followers at Chi
cago and all oyer this country in 1896 an
nounced that our money never could in
crease without the free and unlimited
coinago of silver. On July 1, 1890, the
money in circulation was $1,509,725,200,
and on Decembor 1, 1898, it was $1,085,
930,964, with prospect of crossing the
$2,000,000,000 mark by the end of the
present month, while the gold coin and
certificates increased from $408,449,212 on
July 1, 1896, to $778,388,303 December 1,
1899, a gain of 31 per cent, in total cur
rency and 50 per cent, in gold and gold
certificates.
"The future government of the Phil
ippines rests with the government of the
United States. Few graver responsibili
ties have ever been confided to us. If we
accept them in a spirit worthy of our
race and our traditions, a great opportu
nity comes with them. The islands lie
under the shelter of our flag. They are
ours by every title of law and equity.
They cannot be abandoned. If we desert
them we leave them at once to anarchy
and finally to barbarism. We fling them,
a golden apple of discord, among the ri
val powers, no one of which could per
mit another to seize them unquestioned."
President McKinley's Annual Message
to Congress.
The President's Message.
The message of Presideut McKinley,
submitted to Congress last week is a
strong, able and conservative document.
It gives to those to whom it is addressed
some sound adyice upon the problems
confronting the country and demanding
solution at their hands. It is also an ex
austive document, treating of many sub
jects, in which the country is vitally in
terested. As to the Philippines the
President goes over the situation care
fully up to the presem date.but leaves the
iuture solution of the problem, as to what
shall be done, in the hands of Congress.
ITe speaks, howeyer, for order, peace and
libeity with the largest protection of hu
man rights possible. Such legislation as
is necessary to permanently establish
this country on a gold basis is advocated,
and it is urged that the secretary of the
treasury be given power to sell bonds
when necessary to meet any emergency
. that may arise. The importance of up
buildingour merchant marine is referred
to at length. Congress should lose no
time in taking such steps as will insure
increasing the amount of our expanding
commerce that is carried in American
vessels. The study of China as a field for
American trade and enterprise is recom
mended. The President takes up the
bubject of trusts at considerable length,
and loaves no doubt as to bis attitude to
ward the class which are formed in the
interest of the few as against the good of
the many.
The President's views with reference to
our duty to our new possessions are in
lino with bis public speeches upon the
subject previous to the last election. They
are in accord with those of the people, as
was amply demonstrated nt the polls.
These are but a few of the subjects
touched upon. The message Is some
twenty-eight thousand words in length
On the outside pages of to-day's paper
will be found an admirable condensa
tion of the document, and we would ear
nestly recommend a careful perusal t
the same by all who have not already
done so.
Improve the Allegheny.
The Republican has on nianv occa
sions called attention to the advantage to
be derived by the lumbermen of this sec
tion in permanent improvement of the
channel of the Allegheny river by the
Government, and has frequently com
mended the worR already done under
governmental supervision as tending to
ward the better navigaiiou of this fine
stream. We are pleased to note that
such journals as the Oil City Derrick is
taking up the matter, and calling atten
tion to the many advantages that would
accrue from such work. In its issue of
yesterday that paper says, editorially:
Forest county is very much interested
in the recommendation of Major Powell,
of the, War Department, that $25,000 l e
expended by the government in the im
provement of the Allegheny river for the
coming year. Its prosporjty is directly
confined to tho maintenance of navig
able channel to Pittsburg at certain sea
sons of the year. The Allegheny has re
ceived few considerations at the hands of
Congress in the way of appropriations in
the past, and though Forest is not in Mr.
Sibley's district, his well known interest
in public improvements of all kinds has
inspired a number of tho progressive cit
rons of the county to request his co-oper
ation in this matter. No organization has
ever boen formed in Forest county with
view to securing government support
in this matter, but the small improve
ments that have been made from time to
time under governmentsnpervisi.m have
been highly appreciated. Theie has been
no rafting stage in the river the past fall,
but the people of Forest county have been
enabled to get out a number of coal barg
es and large amount ol lumber, owing
to the fact that the improvements started
a few years ago made such a thing prac
ticable. If they had been compelled to
depend on natural conditions in tho river
and nothing had been done towards deep
ening the channel, and directing the cur
rent within circumscribed bounds, it
would have been utterly impossible to
have floated any lumber to the mouth of
the river. There are from 150 to 200 coal
barges built in Forest county every year
at au average value of $1,200 to $1,500
each. These are floated down the Alle
gheny and sold at Pittsburg for use iu the
coal traffic between that city and points
to the southward. The labor cost in
building one of these barges is at least
$200 to say nothing of the portion labor
raceives for cutting down the timber and
converting it into lumber suitable for
manufacture, lit sides these several hun
dred boat bottoms are constructed every
year at a contract price of $000 a pair,
which are used in the manufacture of the
cheaper coal b ata used for traffic on the
lower Mississippi. In addition, at least
500,000 cubio feet of logs were rafted out
of Forest county within the past year and
tho prospects are good for as much moie
the coming year. The success of the busl
ness is dependent entirely upon getting
to the market and the river affords the
readiest and easiest communication. Ex
cept that large floods render the Alleghe
ny navigable at certain seasons, the bus
iness would never have reached its pres
ent proportions. The people of Fc rest
county are not alone interested in this
subject, but it forms an important addi
tion every year, to the resources of the
State.
If it is true, as it undoubtedly is, that
gold is now our standard of money val
ues, the future needs only the assurance
that it will so continue to be, until at
least the people shall be so united in
their desire for a change therein a to be
able to direct the voice of both Houses of
Congress, and seenrn the approving sig
nature of the Chief Executive. The con
fidence that Congress will furnish this
kind of a guarantee has inspired enter
prise, called capital into use, improved
the condition of labor, and given no
impetus to all our energies. To make
this favorable state of affairs permanent,
the highest security should be given
that the common denominator of all cal
culations in value shall remain un
changed. President McKinley to Con
gress. Immense majorities for any political
party are not wholesome. It tends to
corruption and loose morals generally.
In referring to the small majority by
which the Republicans hold the House
of Representatives at Washington the
Washington Star very properly says :
"Nearly all the comment on tne situation
in the House includes a reference to the
fact that the Republican majority is
small. And both the party and the coun
try are congratulated on the fact. It is
an advantage. It insures caution and
conservatism. There can be no pranking
when every vote is necessary to pass
party measures. Consultations must be
frequent and thorough. Leaders must
keep in touch with their followers, and
followers must be on hand to support the
leaders. Tyrany on the one hand, there
fore, and negligence on the other, are
alike torbidden by the plain dictates of
safety and common sense."

pleased to teat n ttiat there is at least one
dreaded disease that science has been
able to cure in nil its singes, and that is
Catarrh. Hall's Catarrh Cure is the only
positive cure known to me medical Ira

by destroying the foundation of In dis
