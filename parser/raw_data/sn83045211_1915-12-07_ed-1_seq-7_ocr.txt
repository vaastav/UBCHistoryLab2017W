In ninny iivpccts I consider the I'rcs
Ideiil's mlilrcss the most remnrUable doc
in,,..., ... ,...,.....1 1... n fil.lnf t-,n,.itlt.
ument ever pctintd by n Chief Kveeutlte
of this nation. The document Is nil tbe
more poi lentous because It was wiltten
by n Democrat. Hut thnl Is explained
h the fact that It Is not theoiles that
(,'oveni our actions, but facts. Mr, Vlb
nll, the representative of the partf of I
the middle class nnd extreme Individual
Ism, udviie.itea nn Incrcnsed Income tu
find
lioveinmeiit action In the crcntlon
of a nierc'i.int marine, and calls upon the I
fulled t-'tnlcs to become the savior of
the 'collectlte' Interests of humanity.
Hut he who has studied history and pai
tlcubiilv the events of the oast two years
need not be astonished nt the polltlcnl J
phenomenon embodied In Mr. llson s
inesstiKC. The propel tied classes of Eu
rope me today compelled to hniitl oter
moie nnd more of their wealth, which Is
hnliiB thrown b) billions Into the fur
nace of the Kuroprnn conflagration. The
L'nlted States must follow suit
"The lilc capltiillst Interests of this

future that they will bo called upon lo

i Indicates terj cleiuly the beKlnnliiB of

"CRUSH THEM OUT," SAYS
WILSON OF 'HYPHENATED'
('nullum d from Tuite One
incrKcd this KlKantlc project Into nn In-
llnltcly Kienter plea for pnn-Aiiicrlcan-
Ism. He Bave i
uew dciiniiiou or mo
It wns:
Monroe Doctrine
The States of America arc not hos
tile rivals, hut co-operating fi lends,
and their Krowing senso of eonimii
nllt of interest, alike In mnttcrs po
lltlcnl and In matters economic. Is
likely to give them a new slgnltlcanco
ns factors in international utfnlrs nnd
In the polltlcnl history of the world.
It presents them ns In a very deep and
lino sense a unit In world affairs, spir
itual partners, standing together be
cause thinking together, uulck with
common sympathies and common
Ideas. Separated, they are subject to
all the crosa-cui rents of tho confused'
politics of a world of hostile rlval
lles: united In spirit and purpose,
they cannot be disappointed of their
peaceful destiny.
This is Pan-Americanism, it has
none of the splilt of empire In It. It
Is the embodiment, the effectual em
bodiment, of the spirit of law and In
dependence nnd liberty and mutual
service."
Ni:V PAN-AMKIUCANISM.
The new Paii-Amcrlcnnlsm, tho Presi
dent eninhnslzcd. was destined to play a
foremost part in the economic leadjust- j
ment which must come udoui wiwi in
end of the Kuiopeun war. He laid stress
on how tho Pnlted States hnd plated
"brother" to Mexico. He reiterated
ngnln that the United Stntes had no :el
tlsh purpose In Its gunrdlnnshlp of tho
South and Central American Republics.
It was an equality of nntlons themselves
independent except In mutual alms and
usplratlons.
OfTHPKST OK HANDCLAPPiNG.
The argument for Pan-Americanism
was at the opening of tho address. The
Congressmen heard It at llrst in silence,
but when ho came to that poitlon re
affirming tho Monroo Doctrine, and In
particular to that phrase where ho enun
ciated the equality and Independence of
all American nations, thero was n vigor
ous, momentary outburst of handclapplug.
Tho pronunclamento "We will aid and
befriend Mexico but will not coerce her"
also evoked n brief round of applause.
For tho most part, however, tho Senators
and Representatives sat engrossed and
silent, taking In every phrase as It fell
from the President's lips.
Not onco did the President's reading

HENRY F
MILLER
Playerforte
THE Henry F. Miller Playerforte is the greatest
value you can obtain in a player a purchase for
a lifetime.
The Playerforte has easier pedal control and an
absence of complicated hand devices, which enables you
to play it easier and more naturally than any other
player-piano. And with this control is the rich tone
that marks every Henry F. Miller instrument.
Player action, a well as the piano, is of our own
construction, giving a unity of purpose and result that
would otherwise be unobtainable.
We shall be glad to demonstrate the Playerforte
to you. Select early for Christmas.

skein of suspicion and criss-crossed clews, the
warm-hearted manliness he displays in the de
nouement, make ''The Riddle of the Night" a dis
tinctive kind of detective story. It commences in

Disc Phonograph is
acknowledged to be
tlin ci'Piifpst invpn-
tion of Thomas A. Edison.
After experiments with
something like two thou
sand three hundred differ
ent reproducers, recorders
and diaphragms, the secret
of true tone reproduction
was found, and Mr. Edi
son's ideal realized.
The reproducer point is
a genuine diamond, re
quires no changing, lasts
forever, and does not wear
the disc, no matter how
many times it is played.
Prices range from
$80 to. $450
And you can buy any of
these on very easy terms
of payment.
