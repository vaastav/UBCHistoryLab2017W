pumping from ten to fifteen barrels and less per day,
have suddenly increased one hundred and fifty or
two hundred per cent, during this period. A new
well 31 feet 8 inches deep, in the vicinity of the old
Gilfilen well, is pumping over one hundred and fifty
barrels of excellent oil per twenty-four hours. This
is the shallowest well on record, scarcely two days'
boring. This extraordinary increase in the old wells,
and the success of the new, has created quite a bustle
among the oil speculators of Western Virginia, and
where but a few weeks ago business looked dreary
and dull; now all is life and bustle.

NEWS OF THE DAY.
THE PEOPLE of tin- District of Columbia art
dissatisfied (aud not without reason ) with tht
way they are governed. The District Com
mittee in each branch of Congress are their
only representatives, and the members, it is
complained, are usually strangers, who don't
care a fig about the interests of the residents
of the District. The Chairman of the House
Committee this session is from Illinois, and
it is presumed that the committees understand
about as well the wants, and would legislate
as intelligently for the denizens of Kam
schatka. as for those of Washington. The
question as to the mode of remedying
the evils to which " District flesh is
heir," has evoked considerable discus
sion, some parties advocating the con
solidation of Washington, Georgetown and
the county, under a territorial governor
aud with a territorial delegate in Congress,
while others, and this proposition seems to
meet with more gen cral favor, propose the
consolidation of Washington, Georgetown and
the county into one municipality, electing its
own officers. The people of Georgetown,
however, frightened at the imminent danger
of negro suffrage since Congress lias con
vened, propose to secede from the District al
together, and unite their fortunes with those
of Maryland. The District is, - iihout doubt,
badly governed, what with the nited jurisdic
tion of tbo local authorities, aud the indiffer
ence of Congress. It is clearly the duty of
the Intter to give more careful attentiou to the
interests of the people.
Both h-uises of Congress re-assembled yesterday af
ter their four day's vacation. In the Senate, Mr.
Wilson presented the petition of g.'svi colored citizens
of the District of Columbia for the right of suffrage.
The petitioners set forth that a largo proportion of
the colored citizens arc property holders, and pay a
large amount of taxes, and they claim that as they
are sufficiently intelligent to build and sustain
churches and institutions of learning, and to
accumulate property, they are sufficiently in
telligent to vote. President Foster laid before the
Senate a memorial from the Union State Central
Committee of Pennsylvania, asking, among other
amendments to the Constitution, that Congress shall
never repudiate the debt contracted by the General
Government; a provision prohibiting any Stato Legis
lature or Convention from assuming or paying any
portion of the rebel debt; and that no State shall be
allowed to withdraw from the Union without the con
sent of all the rest.
The most important feature of the proceedings of
the day were a preamble and series of resolutions in
troduced in the Senate by Mr. Wade, and the House
by Mr. Schenck, of Ohio, in relation to the course
pursued by the Emperor of the French and the Em
peror Maximilian, in the affairs of Mexico, and the
indicated policy of Napoleon in declaring that it was
his intention to establish a monarchy in Mexico.—
The preamble cites, among other acts contrary to the
spirit of the age, the decree of the so-called Emperor
of Mexico, in re-establishing slavery in his dominions.
The resolutions contemplate the present condition
of affairs in the Republic of Mexico with the most
profound solicitude: sets forth that the attempt to
subvert one of the Republican governments of this
continent by a foreign power, and to establish on its
ruins a monarchy, sustained solely by European bay
onets, is opposed to the declared policy of the United
States Government aud offensive to the spirit of our
institutions; and call upon the President of the
United States to take such steps concerning this
grave matter as will indicate the recognized policy
and protect the honor and interests of our Govern
ment.
These resolutions were referred to the Coosniittoe
on Foreign Affairs, and ordered to he printed.
Speaker Colfax announced the standing commit
tees of the House of Representatives. Mr. Wash
burne, of Illinois, is chairman of the committee on
the death of President Lincoln, and retains his place
as chairman of the Committee on Commerce; General

of Military Affairs, whilo Rice, of Massachusetts, is
retained as chairman of the Committee on Naval
Affairs, General Ranks has the first, and Raymond,
of New Fork, the second place on the Committee on
Foreign Affairs. Morrill, of Vermont, presides over
the t'ouunittee of Ways and Means, and Hooper, of
Massachusetts, is second on the list.

Spauiding, Higby and Wright are experienced and
capable men. Pomcroy, of New York, and Hooper,
of Massachusetts, occupy the first and second places
on the Committee on Banking and Currency.
The selections for tho various committees in the
main, are regarded as judicious, and proper. Mary
laud is represented on the Judiciary Committee and
the .Select Committee on Bankrupt Law, by Frank
Thomas: by John L. Thomas. Jr.. on the Committee
on the death of President Lincoln, Committees on
Commerce and Revolutionary Claims: and by Hiram
McCullougli on tho Committee on the District of

Horace Greeley on Reconstruction
AT. AT. AT.
WASHINGTON, Dee. 11th, 1865.
HORACE GREELEY ON RECONSTRUCTION.
Mr. Horace Greely to-day addressed the following
card to the editor of the National Intelligencer :
"In your issue of this morning you have spoken of
my presence in Washington and of my view of the
political situation in terms which seem to reauire
of nie a few explanatory words I herewith submit
them:
"I desire and labor for peace. Peace between our
country and nil others. Peace North and South.—
Pi • between white and black. We have had
enough of war and waste; of havoc and car
nmrc, for at least a century. Hence I have
long labored and still labor for true and lasting peace.
1 can conceive no possible good to our country—
to any country, to any section, race or class that
is likely to be secured or promoted by alienation be
tween the President and the Congress of the United
States. On the contrary, it seems to me that even
peril that now threatens us. every evil that now
weighs upon us, would be aggravated; every good put
at hazard: every hope clouded, if not blasted, by such
a malign, untoward collision. I have come here to
do whatever I can, however little that may be, to
ward averting such a catastrophe. But I am not, a°
your paragraph would seem to imply that I am. the
id\ teste of any special plan of reconstruction. I
urge only that the President and Congress, each re
specting the other's prerogatives and personal
convictions, shall freclv and trustfully confer, discuss
mid consider, with a profound deference for each
other's patriotism, and an earnest desire to agree on
a courso of action which they shall mutually deem just
and beniticent.
I "hot the great problem of reconstruction be ap-
I proached from all sides in this spirit, and I feel sure
' that a benign solution will be speedily attained. Our
difficulties are aggravated by the fact that our posi
tion is essentially novel ! I can recall no parallel to
it in human history. It is complicated by questions
affecting the natural rights of the freedmen: and our
moral obligation to tlieui as our humble allies iu the
late momentous struggle. That, we may promptly
re-establish the Southern States in all the'r original
rights and liberties, without sacrificing or hazarding
those of any portion of the American people, is the
earnest desire of
"Yours. HORACE GREELEY.
"Washington, Dec. 11,1865."
JEFF DAVIS AT THE SOUTH.
The opinion is very general among the Southern men
here who have been most closely connected with pub- >
lie affairs in the Southern States for the last four years, |
that Jefferson Davis is not only the cause of the over
throw of the Confederacy, but that h e purposely pro
longed the war. During the first year of the rebel
lion he refused they say over and over again to au
thorize purchases absolutely necessary for its suc
cessful prosecution, and at various times subsequently
his course was such as to inspire very serious doubts
of his fidelity to tho cause he had espoused.
Some of those who were the most prominent officers
of the rebel army, say they can account for his action
only on the supposition that he hoped, by prolonging
the contest and bringing the South to a position of
desperation, to be clothed with absolute power, at
which he had evidently aimed from the beginning.
They further say that the opinion is prevalent at the
South, that Davis was actually acting upon an un
derstanding with Mr. Lincoln, and that he prevented
successes which the rebel army might have achieved,
in order to carry out this understanding.
The fact is, Davis is held responsible at the South
for the failure of the rebel cause, and everyone has
a theory of his owe upon which to explain it. A
correspondent of the New York Times, in speaking
of this matter the other day, remarked that every
great community must have a scapegoat for its fail
ures, as well as i*s sins: anil in this case Davis is the
most natural and convenient victim. While a good
many Southern people feel for him personally the
sympathy which personal suffering always excites,
he has absolutely no political friends in the Southern
States, and tho petitions for his life are prompted
quite as much by tho fear that his execution would
create a party in his favor, and give his name a posi
tion in the history of their war for independence
which it does not deserve, its by any other motive.
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
The Commissioner of Indian Affairs received a let
ter from J. R. Grace, United States special Indian
Agent at Fort Larncd. He represents that very little
trouble had been experienced with the hostile bands
of Indians which infested the plains. Little Roh,
Chief of the Cheyennes, called at Fort Larncd, and
stated that ho and his warriors acknowledged their
allegiance to the Government, and expressed their
determination to abide by and strictly observe the
recent treaty made with their tribe.
The Indians who committed the recent depreda
tions belong to tho band of Dog Indians, otherwise
known as outcasts. The loyal Indians are anxious
to join the Government forces and assist in extermi
nating this entire band. They believe that the next
scene of bloodshed will be on the route between Fort
Dodge and Fort Lamed, as hostile bands, numbering
over 2,000 Indians, are collecting on the route, with
a view to destroying the overland coaches.
THE LADY CLERKS DESIRE ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION.
It L understood that tho seven hundred and fifty
ladies now employed in the Treasury Department
have agreed to set before Congress at an early day
the urgent necessity that exists among them lor an
increase of salary. Copious and incontrovertible evi
dence is to be submitted, going to show that seven
hundred dollars per annum is far from commensurate
with the expense of supplying their feminine wants,
however frugally they may regard them.
EDITORS ON TUE MESSAGE.
About four hundred editorials upon the President's

THE CLAIMS OF MISSOURI.
Representatives of and commission on behalf of
the State of Missouri, arrived here Sunday evening,
with instructions to present to Congress the claims of
that State for four millions of dollars, alleged to be
due her for expenditures on account of the govern
ment during the war.
THE COLOMBIAN CLAIMS.
The joint commission for the settlement of claims
between the United States of America and the United

Nearly all of them result in judgment for the claim
ants.
SOLDIERS' DISCHARGES.
Speculators arc busily engaged in different parts of
the country in buying up soldiers discharge papers,
for which they are paying from SIOO to S6CO. In Mas
sachusetts S3OO have been paid, and in Ohio S6OO. If
a sufficient number can be purchased, the Lobby will
endeavor to force Congress to pass a law giving boun
ties to all soldiers who have not had them, and equal
izing those who have.
A MAMMOTH SALE.
To-morrow the Government will offer at auction
at Alexandria, the largest amount of property it has

000 feet of lumber, 2,500 tons of railroad iron, 2,ooocar

smitbery, Ac. This will be the last sale here, and will
probably occupy two days.
TAX ON COTTON, TOBACCO AND WHISKY.

TERRIBLE RAILROAD ACCIDENT.— The Alexandria
(iazetto of Friday evening gives the following brief
account of n terrible railroad accident which oc
curred on the South Side road on Thursday:
"Wc learn that an accident occurred on the South
Side railroad yesterday, by which thirty persons
were instantly killed and about fifty wounded, some
very seriously. The accident was caused by the giv
ing way of a trestle bridge oyer the Jaines River, six
miles froui Lynchburg, precipitating the passenger
train into the river, causing a complete smash-up of
the train and the killing and mangling of the pas
sengers." .
REPUDIATION BY WHOLESALE.— The Jackson (Miss.)
Oar ion says: On Wednesday last the most sweeping
repudiating resolution ever presented to a deliberate
assembly was adopted bv the .Senate. It declares
that "the State will not. aud should not, pay any
debt agaiust the State, whether on account of salaries
of officers, treasury notes, 'change bills or otherwise,
originating between the 9th day of January, 1861, and
the 16th day of October, 1864; and the Treasurer of the
State is hereby directed not to pay any warrant or
claim based upon any such demand; and all receivers
of public moneys are hereby forbidden to receive any
such warrant on demand for dues to the State."
A SAD PRACTICAL JOKE.—A foolish practical joke
was lately played at Rastatt, Prussia, which proved
eventually to be no joke to the party playing it. A
soldier belonging to the company on guard, wrapped
himself up in leaves and branches in such a manner
as entirely to conceal his humanity, and, in the mid
dle of the night, crept up on all fours to one of the
sentinels. The latter, astonished at the extraordi
nary phenomenon, challenged it three times without
receiving any answer. Upon this he put his bayonet
into it, and the intruder fell without uttering a sound.
It was his last joke. The man was dead.
The Rev. John Gosman. of Kingston, N.
Y., died at Saugerties on the Bth inst. He had been
for 30 years the pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church
in the former place.
A Charleston paper takes satisfaction in
saying that General Grant, on his recent visit in that
oity. "was quietly received by the military authori
ties. The negroes and Northern citizens turned out
in considerable numbers to see the General, but na
tive Charlestonians all turned their faces persistently
towards the business parts of the city as the hour for
his arrival approached. A few merchants mostly
'Yankees' invited the distinguished guest to a dinner
at the Charleston Hotel, but he declined for want of
time."
In the Alabama House, Mr. Smith, of
Choctaw, has introduced a bill to prohibit marriage,
Ac., between the black and white races. Intermar
riage is made felony by the bill, punishable by im
prisonment for the whites, and branding and whip
ping for the negroes. Other disreputable connections
between the races subject the whites to a fine of one
thousand dollars and imprisonment in the county
jail for twelve months. The other parties to the
erlme are to receive "one hundred lashes on his or
her hare back*"

The French Organ on the Message.
The National Intelligencer has translated the follow
ing from the Conrricr des Etat Unis of tho 7th:
The impression produced upon the press and public
by the President's message has been decidedly most
favorable. Fur our part, wc cannot but praise, with
out reserve, all that relates to internal policy. Mr.
Johnson has expressed himself as a patriot and a
statesman, and his diction —always clear, and some
times eloquent—is In happy contrast to the eccentri
cities and diffuse obscurity to which we were accus
tomed from his predecessor.
Though not quite satisfied with the language of
Mr. Johnson concerning France and England, we are
pleased to perceive that the Chief Magistrate has at
least abstained from the empty declamation which
is, unfortunately, too much the fashion in the United
States. The President, whilst firm in regard to
Great Britain, sees above all, in the present contro
versy. a question of principles, and does not demand
actual redress for certain grievances. In respect to
France, it will be remarked that Mr. Johnson re
frains from mentioning the Monroe doctrine, hut
tbat he, nevertheless, adheres to the principles
which it enunciates. The paragraph in question is
an indirect setting at rest the abandonment of Mex
ico, and a threat, payable when due. made elsewhere
in a milder form. For France, as for England, the
United States will take its time and await its oppor
tunity. It is probable Mr. Johnson will have more
to say when he communicates to Congress the diplo
matic documents to which he alludes.
The Presidential message has met with almost uni
versal approbation. AVill Congress submit to the
opinions, and second the views of Mr. Johnson, in
stead of combating tliem? This tbe future will re
veal. In Europe the message will excite profound
interest, and there is no doubt but that, in all that
relates to internal affairs, it will be unanimously and
warmly approved. Iu all cases they will recognize in
liitn a superior man,such as we have scarcely seen in
the AVhite House the present generation.
SMUGGLING.— The smugglers are an ingenious c'ass
of individuals. Their recent inventions, called into
requisition by the energy and watchfulness of the
Government, arc so novel that nobody hut a shrewd
detective would expose them. Mr J. AV. Ingalls, the
collector of customs at Cape Vincent, on the St. Lnw
renco river, informs the Commissioner of the Bureau
that great consternation exists among the smugglers
who have been doing business between that point
and Kingston, on the Canada sido, owing lo the
frustration of their schemes, caused by the recent
arrangement made by the collector at Cape A'inccnt.
A female examining agent has been appointed, who
searches suspected women passing to and fro. Since
the adoption of this new inspection officer, large
quantities of clothing have been detected and seized,
and certain firms which contemplated going into
business in Kingston have since abandoned the idea.
A letter from the collector of customs at Dunkirk,
N. Y'.. written to the Commissioner, relates one of
the new and ingenious devices resorted to by the
smugglers infesting those shores for the surreptitious
introduction of liquors from Canada.
The barrels are carried near to the American side,
at a comparatively safe time, which is ascertained by
t he posting of watchmen, who give notice by a system
of signals when it is safe to venture forth. The bar
rels are then thrown overboard, and, of course, im
mediately sink. Previous to their being thrown over,
however, strong iron staples are screwed into each
barrel: all the barrel? arc then connected by means
of these staples and anchored, a buoy being first at
tached to mark their whereabouts. At night boats
or rafts are used to tow them in by simply making
the main cable fast to the raft or boat. The discov
ery of this last dodge for eluding the vigilance of the
custom officer has broken up the subaqueous liquor
traffic. m
AMUSEMENTS.
TAE ITALIAN OPERA.—Manager Grover's plan of
disposing of subscription tickets gains favor as it is
being understood, as was evidenced by the brisk de
mand at McCaffrey's yesterday. The coming opera
season will undoubtedly be one of the greatest events
in the history of music in Baltimore. The theatre,
like all we have in this city, not being particularly
large, the public will see the importance of filing
their applications for secured plaoes as early as pos
sible.
The sale yesterday was double that of any other
ever made before on a similar occasion here, and un
til the announcement shall be made that tho time for
choice of seats has arrive!, persons who may hand
in their names will have the same ehanee for good
places as those who have preceded them. It is grati
fying to know that Mr. Grover's enterprise is being
fully appreciated and warmly sustained. Opera is
one of the first of polite amusements, and like all
other oostly luxuries can only be enjoyed by the ren
dering of a full equivalent.
HOLLIDAY STREET THEATRE— Miss Mangie Mitchell.
—For the first time this season, this brilliant actress
will appear as Marie in the beautiful musical play
entitled the Pearl of Savoy, or a Mother's Prayer.
She will be supported by Mr. S. Lamb, of the AVash
ington Theatrer, Mr. Bishop and Mrs. AYilkins. The
Savoyard's song and dance in the third act is capital.
MARYLAND INSTITUTE,— The original Raynor's
Minstrels and Brass Band, twenty artists all told,
commence an engagement of four nights only at the
Maryland Institute to-morrow evening. This is, per
haps, the best minstrel troupe in the country.
The New York Times says, the Hon. A. P.
Field, who, it will be remembered, was a candidate
for admission to Congress from Louisiana a year ago,
and who gained considerable unenviable notoriety by
his personal assault on Judge Kelly, last AYinter, has
become thoroughly converted by the course of events
In his State, protests earnestly against the admission
of the State until unimpeachable guarantees are of
fered for tbe protection and safety of Union men.

RIGIIT OP SUFFRAGE.
Mr. Wilson presented the petition of John Francis
Cook, and 2,000 others, colored citizens of the Dis
trict of Columbia, for the right of suffrage. The peti
tioners set forth. That n large proportion of tho col
ored citiiens are property holders, and pay a large
amount <>f taxes. They claim that as they arc suffi
ciently intelligent to build and sustain churches and
institutions of learning, and to accumulate property,
they are sufficiently intelligent to vote. That for
many years they have been obliged not onlv to
educate their own children, hut to contribute to the
support of the schools in which onlv white children
were taught. That the record of the colored people
;<s to crime and pauperism is as fair as anvother class
in the community. Out of a population "fleas than
10,000, they sent 6,500 soldiers into the field, while the
white population, over 60.000, furnished only 1,500;
and the colored soldiers volunteered without the
incentives of large bounties, pay or promotion. Re
ferred to Committee on District of Columbia.

iog it.
That it. is the duty of neighboring States to assist
each other in guarding rights and interests common

nized as a remedy for mere pecuniary grievances by
American States, and that the forcible seizure of
Mexico by foreign troops, the seating of a foreign em
peror on a throne elected on the ruins of that repub
lic, and his retention by foreign bayonets, is in vio
lation of all these, and cannot be permitted by the
United States without failing in the highest duties of

That the Committee on Foreign Relations be in

A telegraph despatch, dated Louisville, Ky.. Dec,
8, says:
At 7 o'clock last evening, notwithstanding adverse
weather, the several Presbyterian congregations of
this city assembled in the Second Presbyterian Church
to take action in behalf of the Kentucky Board of
Aid for Southern Pastors.
A fine choir opened the services by singing, with
touching effect, 'Glory to God in the highest, and on
earth peace and goodwill to men."
The Rev. John C. Young then offered up a prayer,
and stated the object of the meeting: and upon calling
for an organization appropriate to the occasion, the
following officers were elected:
Hamilton Pope, president: General J. C. Boyle,
Hon. P. B. Muir, and Hon. W. F. Burnett, vice presi
dents: and Rev. R, Morrison, secretary.
After the united congregations had again joined in
singing a hymn, stirring addresses were delivered by
the Rev. J. L. MeKee, Rev. John C. Young, Hamilton
Pope, General Boyle, Hon. W. F. Burnett, and others.
Letters were read from Rev. E. P. Humphrey, I).
D., and Rev. R. G. Brank, heartily endorsing the
board and expressing an earnest desire to promote
its success by active co-oneration.
An appeal was now maae to the audience to demon
strate tbeir earnestness in this cause, which was re
sponded to in a spirital manner, resulting in a few
minutes in contributions to the amount of four thou
sand dollars.
This was highly gratifying, as the work had but
fairly commenced, and testifies that the hearts of the
§eople here are truly in the work of relieving the
estitution and misery of their brethren.
From all quarters of the State reDoris couie to the
Board that the Presbyterians are fully awakened to
the importance of immediate action, and liberal sup
port is promised to carry out the measures of relief.
The Board have perfected all the arrangements
necessary to effect a prompt distribution of the
funds intrusted to their hands.
After singing the Doxology, "Praise God from
whom all blessings flow/ the united congregations
commenced to disperse, the choir singing meanwhile,
with brilliant effect. Haydn's grand chorus, "Halle
lujah to the God of Israel."
Thus closed one of the most harmonious, kindly.
Christian, and interesting occasions in the history of
the Presbyterians In this city.

CITY NEWS
THE RESTORATION OF THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
—The city Circuit Court room was yesterday tho centre
of considerable interest, it having been announced
that Judge Alexander would deliver his opinion in
the eases of Luther S. Sands and Alexander Kirk
land, who were before the Court in response to a
writ of hahcni corpus directed to General Woollcy,
provost marshal, who had them in custody as de
serters from the United States army. The Court
observed, after having reviewed the positions as
sumed by the counsel for the petitioner and on behalf
of the Government, that it must he kept steadily in
mind that the issue for this Court to try, is as to who
is entitled to the custody of the person and has the
right to tho services of Luther S. Sands, an infant
tinder eighteen years of age—the Government of the
United States or the lather ? who, never having con
sented to his enlistment, claims the custody of his
person and the right to his services. The general
principle that the father is entitled to the guardian
ship and services of his son, his Honor observed, is so
well and long settled as not to be called in question,
although this right maybe interfered with by a Court
of Chancery, or may be suspended or barred by the
superior claims of the public.
And it is this public claim to services which is now
set up by the respondent: and it is alleged the Gov
ernment claims hi 3 services as an enlisted soldier
Undoubtedly Congress has the right to say at what
age the claim of thclpublic to the services of the citizen
shall attach, and it has by enactment declared that
no minor under tho age of 18 shall be mustered into
the military service without the consent of parents
or guardians or master. Now, the evidence is clear
that at the time Luther S. Sands enlisted he va -
under 17 years of age, and it is not shown that the
consent of the father was obtained to the enlistment.
But the proof is positive that the father did not give
his consent. To the view to the counsel for the Gov
ernment, that the oath taken hv Luther S. Sand.- is
conclusive, the Judge said that, -o far as Luther S.
Sands is affected by it. Congress ha- done nothing
more than incorporate in its act a rule for the law of
evidence which existed previous to Congress itself:
and certainly Luther S. Sands would not be peri
nutted, in any court of law. to deny tho truth of w hat
he has sworn, lint the oath i- not binding upon
the courts nor upon other parties in cases affecting
them; nor could any act of Congress make it so.
What Congress .intended to do was to bind the
recruit himself and save the recruiting officer
front the penalty of the law l'or enlisting minors
without the consent of parents, guardian.-. Ac.
Aor is the relator bound by Luther's alleged en
listment oath. And in the enquiry it is competent to
go behind it. hut it is not necessary, nor does the
Court charge Luther with perjury. His Honor then
entered into the discussion of tho jurisdiction of the
Court in reference to tho writ of ki'i< ....pin,, and
decided that thcCourt had jurisdiction in the matter,
and concurrent jurisdiction with tho United States
Coßrt.-. and that l.uther S. Sands was incompetent to
contract, and that the father had the right to the
services of his infant son, and a Court of Equity a
jurisdiction in the matter.
The Court observed that, to charge a parly with
crime is a solemn act, and that the law, whether civil
or military, requires certain forms to be observed,
which cannot be dispensed with, to bring that charge
within the notice of Courts of Justice, and no charge
of criminal offence i- .-et up here. Nor is it alleged he
i- in the custody of a court on such charge: nor that a
court has been convened to try him on such a charge.
The only question presented to this Court is one of
contract, with the rights of the father over his infant
son. The other questions raised do not close tho door
to the action of the Court upon that one.
Ilis Honor then stated that he was of opinion that
Luther P. Sands was not brought before the court on
a writ of lull.ens crime, charged with a criminal of
fence, and that the enlistment oath taken by him was
not binding upon tho Court, nor did it deprive the
lather of his right to the custody of the son. In con
elusion, the Couri remarked that the rebellion was at
an end, was true from the public documents, and the
emergency having passed for the suspension of the
writ of hah. a* crime, it was now restored, and he
therefore ordered the discharge of Luther S. Sands
and Alexander Kirkland.
The order was at once complied with by General
M oolley, (the parties being in court, under guard.)
and they were restored to their parents, who were
also present.

A NEW COURT MARTIAL.—An extract from special
order No. 122, issued from the headquarters of the
Middle Military Department, under dato of the ftth
instant, convenes a goneralcourt martial, to assemble
on the 11th instant, for the trial ol" Surgeon 0. M.

Brevet Lieut. Colonel C. C. Parsons, U. S. A., Judge

these can be assembled without manifest injuryto the
service, and directs the court to sit without regard to
hours. In pursuance of the order, the court met yes
terday, at tho office of General Woollcy, Provost
Marshal, that place having been selected with a view
to the accommodation of the President of the Court,
whoso duties, now so largely increased, demand at
this time very close attention. The scarcity of ofii
cers in the department m„ la it necessary, it is under
stood, for the commanding general to appoint upon
this court some officers whose regular duties would
scarcely admit of such an additional tax upon their
time.
WERE NOT DROWNED. —Within a few days past it
has been stated that John Clements, a private of the
Ist New York Mounted Rifles, and Daniel IV. Law
rence, a private of the 39th Illinois Regiment, were
drowned while coming up the river with their re
spective regiments en route for home. The first
named was reported as having fallen overboard, while
the other jumped overboard in a fit of temporary in
sanity. It now appears that neither were drowned.
Clements was picked up by a schooner, near Fort
Carroll, on Thursday morning last, and landed upon
tho farm of Mr. Crisp, on Curtis' Creek, at whose
house he is now recovering. When found he was
nearly frozen to death, Lawrence reported himself
to General Woolley, Provost Marshal, on Saturday
morning last, for transportation to bis home, lie
stated that he jumped overboard with the intention
of committing suicide, but upon striking the water
he recovered his reason and swam ashore. He left
the city on Sunday evening for Springfield, 111., his
friends having been previously notified of his safety.
THE YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION.—Last
evening the fourth social reunion of the Young
Men's Christian Association of Baltimore took place

number of ladies and gentlemen were jiresent, and
the occasion was characterized by pleasant social in
tercourse, addresses, and literary exercises by mem
bers of the Jackson Society. These rooms hare been
open to visitors for some weeks past, and contain, in
addition to a complete file of the religious periodicals
of tho day, a well selected library of twelve hundred
volumes. The association of this city was organ
ized in 1848, and is therefore one of the first in the
United States. The "Young Men's Christian Jour
nal," is the title of a neat monthly periodical pub
lished under the auspices of this institution, and
within the last few weeks the" Jaekson Literary
Association" has been formed, and holds weekly
meetings in these rooms.
ASSACLT.— Patrick Gannan was taken into custody
yesterday, by officer Flayhart, of the Middle district,
charged with assaulting and striking Abraham Free
man, at No. 60 Centre Market Space. Justice Spicer
dismissed the charge, but fined the accused $1 and
costs for being drunk and disorderly, and in default
of payment, committed him to jail.

mond, of the Savannah line, and not the Cumber

the repairs to the Richmond being completed in a
short time.

SUICIDE. —Shortly after six o'clock last evening a
young German named Charles ICessler, entered the
jewelry store of Louis lteinhardt, No. 53 Mulberry
street, with whom he was intimately acquainted,
passed into a room in the renrol the store, and. draw
ing a revolver, shot himself through the heart, which
caused his death almost instantly. Coroner Green -
tree was summoned and held an inquest, the jury
centring a verdict to the effect that his death was
caused by his own hand. No one was in the room at
the time of the shooting. A little boy, who was in
the store, upon licaring the report of the pistol,
rushed iu and observed the unfortunate man with
revolver in his hand before he fell to the floor. The
deceased was formerly a soldier in the 35th Massa
chusetts regiment, and came to this eountryjin 1864,
from Germany, where his parents now reside. He
was a locksmith by trade, about 22 years of age, and
unmarried.
In the early part of the day he had a difficulty with
a young lady in the house in which ho hoarded, and
with whom he was in love, and it is inferred that the
difference with hor caused him to commit the rash
act. He is represented to have been a man of steady
habits. He boarded with Mr. Weber, in Inloes' al
ley, near Mulberry street, in the rear of the house in
which ho killed himself. A short time previous to
the fatal affair, he called at the house of Mr. Weber
and asked for the young lady, but finding her out,
he said 'good-bye to all," and in a few minutes af
terward he was a corpse.
DISCONTINUANCE OF THE NAVAL STATION AT BAL
TIMORE.—On the 6th instant the naval station was
discontinued at this port, by order of the Secretary
of the Navy, and accordingly on that day Commodore
Thomas A. Dornin lowered his broad pennant and
retired from the command. He now awaits orders.
During the existence of the station here an immense
amount of patronage of the Navy Department in
this city lias been dispensed, covering nearly the en
tire duration of the war. Commodore Dornin has
been in command from tho outset, and it is but jus
tice to an able and experienced officer to say that tho
change which necessitates has relief from command
is a source of regret to a large circle of friends. No
man in a similar position in this city lias so generally
commanded tho respect and admiration of all who
have been brought into contact with him, and where
ever he may go the good wishes of the people of Bal
timore will follow him. He is a good officer and an
accomplished gentleman.

late executive officer of the Baltimore Naval Station,
has been ordered to report to Rear Admiral F. H.
Gregory, for duty as Assistant Inspector of iron-clad
vessels at Baltimore.

CITY LMIIK ES.
JEWELRY.— Among the many presonts suitablo in
the approaching Christmas season, none is more ap
preciated than the valuable aud ocautiful articles of
jewelry. A fine gold watch, a costly ring, or any
other article of showy, but intrinsic value, is pre
ferred by most persons to presents more useful, and,
perhaps, more expensive, yet not adap'ed as well for
public display. In appreciation of this popular
fancy, Messrs. fcam. Kirk A Sons, No. 172 M est Bal
timore street, have supplied themselves with an un
usually large assortment of fashionable and beauti
fuljewelry, and offer them at low rates. Our readers
will do well to call and survey their stock before
they make their purchases for the approaching sea
son.
LADIES' TOlLßT.— Female beauty has exercised
more or less influence upon the history of mankind
from the days of "Delilah" to the classic period of
"Aspasia" and "Cleopatra," and again from the rae
diaival age of tho Medicis ' and the reign of female
charms in the time of Louis XIV, up to the present
day. It is also true that beauty rules fashion, and
fashion leaves ample scope to human skill in supply
ing some small demands of time and season, and
therefore it must be highly appreciated, if business
men understand to supply the wants arising from
the little divergencies betweeu nature and fashion.
The belles and "beaux" of our city oertainly owe
thanks to us for calling their attention to tho adver
tisement of Mr. Wni. 11. Read, No. 147 W. Baltimore
street, who actually oilers in his perfumeries, toilet
articles and cosmetics, more to his customers than
any sorcerer, wizzard or alchemist of yore was able to
brew or stew over his mystic fires.
