Illinois was ninety jenrs old Thursday.
On Dec. II. ISIS, the northern jmrt of
"Illinois ground," as It was (hen known,
was ndmltted as a Slate of the federal
Fnlon after a hard struggle on the art
of Natbsnlel Pope, the Illinois delegate,
who succeeded ill having the northern
boundary extended fifty miles to Include
Chicago. The anniversary of Illinois'
birth h a Stale was marked by no largo
celebration I lie only formal obrrvnncu
being In the public schools. At the time
of the January, ISIS, session of the Illi
nois territorial legislature, tin? population
of Illinois bad Increased to -lO.OMO nnd
n resolution wns adopted directing ('on
gresslomil Delegate Pope to picent 11 pe
tition to Congress requesting the enact
ment of n law to enable the people to
form n Slate government. This bill wns
Intnsluccd on April 7, ISIS. Congress
accepted the bill favorably, and, acting in
accordance with the ordinance of 1787,
would lime made the northern lioiinclnry
of the Stnte "nn east-and-west line draw
ing through the somberly Is'iul or ex
treme of Lake Michigan." This would
have excluded Chicago. Mr. Pope saw nt
once the future lmsrtance of Chicago
nnd made Ids earnest plea for the strik
ing out of the lines already planned and
the insertion of the one which constitutes
the present boundary nud which added
8..VMI siiare miles to Illinois. In bin
speech before Congress Mr. Pope sjioko
of the iuiK)i'tnucc of Chicago as a port
nnd the possibility of the waterway be

Chicago won Id one day be the connecting
link between the East nnd West of the

MYSTERY IN MURDERS.

llett-nl Stnr- nt Slrnnui- Deaths,
Dr. B. F. Braylleld of .Mnlke.Mown was
indicted at Benton the other evening on
the charge of murdering Reuben F. Pnr
ilsh, formerly nn Illinois Central station

charging Bra.xfleld with foiglug the naini
ol Isham Harrison, Justice of the peace,
t a iiMT he used lu an attempt to col
led n ."jill.OOO Insurance sdlcy on the
death of Mrs, Braylleld, who died Inst
March within a week of Parrlsh's death.
Gossip had connected the names of Mrs.
ParrWh and Braylleld, stating that the
two had met clandestinely prior to Par
rlsh's death. These rumors hud reached
Parrish, but he apparently paid little at
tention to them, because when he became
III he summoned Dr. Braylleld, with whom
hi was friendly. It Is now believed hy
mime that neither Mr. Parrish nor Mrs.
Itrn j tii'lcl died from natural causes. In
Ids last Mine,. Parrish was attended only
by Dr. Braylleld. Though he had nlwajs
been In good health, hi' showed signs of
n sudden decline early In .March and died
.March tl after other physicians who hail
In en called in refused in have anything to
do with the case on tho ground that "It
lookisl mysterious." Mrs, Itrn j Held de
tinue III the night of Parnsn's death. She,
too. wns attended only by her husband,
and dlis March lit, Parrish had uu In
surance policy In the Modern Woodmen

silted lu the Royal Neighbors for Jf.'.OOO.
The Impilry was forced by Mjron W.

"'Uere will be less slo.'k fed In Illinois

C. .liuly, a big fanner and stock raiser
of Tallula. Col. .lady. In lilts statement,
icllec-ted the opinion that seems to be held
by all other agriculturists who have paid
particular attention to the situation. It
Is a rcimukahlc fad that many f.irmciw
nre selling their crops of corn in the Held
this fall. The selling of entire crops in
(lie Held means that practically all tho
Illinois crop will go direct to the eleva
tors, and little will be left in the hands
of I lie raisers. As a lesult there is sure
to be a decided falling off in stis'k f I-
lug. It Is estimated that the amount of
