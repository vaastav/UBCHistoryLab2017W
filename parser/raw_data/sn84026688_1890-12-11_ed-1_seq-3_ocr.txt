Morrison is our authority for the following ; '
Some time recently Peter Gerhart, tenant on
Morrison s farm at the “Old Factory” post- ]
od notices on the place warning hunt
ers not to tresspass thereon. One day re
cently Gerlmrl found a placard on the post,
on which was a threat of some kind, to be
curried out in event that the trespass notices
were not removed within n certain limit of
lime. Several days ago a reaper in one of
the fields was set on (Ireand burned, and Mr. |
Morrison looks upon this as a carrying out of
the threat. The story as told to us is 100 |
vague for an intelligent report, but nevcilhe
less, be is considerably agitated oyer the
matter. Howe er it is well enough for the
person or persons who put up the notice to
know that even if it was done in a joking 1
manner, they arc trifling with what may j
prove a serious matter. As regards the
burning of the reaper, Mr, Morrison says Hint |
really did occur, but tie failed to say why
the reaper was in the field. 1 f the grain crop
is ready to harvest out t here at this season,

The President's Message,
What the Pressor the Country Thinks
of it.
Warihimjtou Post : The message as a whole
is to ho commended for its tone ami temper.
Those wlm were expecting from the president
a wail of despair over the recent political
reverses of his parly or a frantic appeal for
help in heh df of a Union endangered hy
Democratic success, will find themselves dis
appointed. Tho President takes a serene
and hopeful view of the situation.
Phila. Press'. The message throughout
m lint tins with earnestness an I hroa 1 ju Ig
merit the policy and principles upon which
the Administration came into power. What
has been don : was in purs’i nice of that poli
cy, and because it was elected on a platform
r quiring it to do those ycry tilings. The
President's courageous and dignified ailln r
cnee 1 1 that course will ( oninmii I the ri sped
and cordial support of his party throughout
the milry.
Phi la. l.ed'/er: Those who read it care
fully can hardly fail to award it the credit of
Ik ini; a plain dispassionate and business like
document ; unless they are inclined to be
li yperci itieal.
y. Y Herald : Mr. Hai risen is an bom si ;
man : but a thorough partisan. We have j
never questioned his motives or his integrity
only his judgment. This last work of his ■
pen will add nothing to his reputation, and
there is no reason why it should. It is cau
tions to the verge ot timidity, and therefore |
inconclusive. The message is tediously long j
but perhaps that may lie attributed to the
foil that the writer had very little to say.
y. T. Snif. The principal tiling m Presi- .
dent Harrison's message is a zealous recoin- 1
inendation that the Force Bill shmil 1 be tak
en up and passed through Congress. This
j scheme should be resisted determinedly, un
yieldingly, uncompromisingly by every
Democrat. If ueec-s.iry every means of de
lay and obstruction should be resorted to in
Congress. Toe mischiefs that arc sure to j
arise from such a political revolution are so j
great apd so grave as to overshadow every
other question.
y. F. World. : In brief tin* message is a ;
thoroughly partisan but otherwise colorless
document whore author writes it not bee mse
he has anything to savor suggest, but be
cause, in the coarse of his routine duly, lie is
required to send a message to Congress nt j
this lime. It makes no effort to grapple with j
the problems of the time or direct legislative j
policy in harmony with the needs and aspir- |
ntions of the people. It is not a Stale paper, |
but a perfnuetory and by no means candid j
review of departmental reports, conceived in j
the spirit of a Bourbon and expressed in the |
tone of a Pharisee.
y. )’. Times: The President has forgotten
little and learned nothing. He meets the
Congress in which Ids party provoked detent
on its reassembling with a tediously* urgent I
exhortation to remedy none ot tin* mistakes
already made, to press forward in the same
line and trust to that Providence which the
i French say watches over “Americans and
fools,’’
W. F. Tribune : It Is a message eminently
fitted to recall the Republican voters of 1888
to a sense of then* responsibility and to re
mind them that the national policies for
which they then declared deserve their un
wavering support.
P/iila. yorth American: President Hand
son has prepared nothing for crunks, kite
flyers aad doctrinaires in his annual message
to Congress. He has taken the view of a I
practical business man, and Ids message is a
business statement to a community ol prac
tical men of business.
Phila. Inquirer. The issues made by the
present Congress must be stuck to, and upon
I hem the next Presidential campaign must be
1 (ought. There is to be no balling and back
mg. That is the inclining of the Prcsidi ill’s 1
message. '
y Y. Press : Conspicuous above its com
pieteness of detail concerning the things that
the public wants to he informed on, and
equally conspicuous above the clear-headed
manner In which he discusses reasons and
makes needed distinctions, shine the perfect
integrity of the man’s intention Justice is
a strong trait of President Hairison's charac
ter, and the evident honesty of his guardian
ship of the public interests must strengthen
him before Hie country.
y. Y. Star: Fashioned after Hie tradi
tional pattern as to subject discussed and
Hie order in whieli they arc mentioned, in
literary and forensic merit it barely rcacacs
mediocrity, while, politically, it is a purely
partisan pica in extenuation of the course of
the administration and the Congress which
the people have just decidedly c unbanned.
y. Mail and Jlrpress : In ilsdetails the
message is remarkable for thoroughness,
simplicity and vigor. In its spirit it is fear
lessly Republican, while it is broadly Ameri
can and patriotic. It is a document
worthy of Hu* great and grave emergencies
that Congress has to meet And the Repub
*! lican majority should be inspired with new
i courage and determination bv the message.
It A I l.ltOAl) BGIIiDIKU.
On Paper ami Ollier wise.
There arc three distinct railroad projects
now being eai ncsilv considered by the people
of ih is comity two of which Imvc the appear
ance of being in accord, with the third utter
ly ignored by both, and yet Ihc third covers
the section of country lying between these
two.
We refer to the Enimitslmrg movement 1
fora road to Gettysburg and (he Middletown
Valley movement, as the two on the face of .
a flairs as being in nenird, and the M. V. &
F. It. If. (extension Of the M. V ) as the third
movement ignored hy the oilier two.
Now, it is our purpose, in this article, to <
amplify a statement made in these columns
several weeks ago, and prove, beyond cavil,
that the proposed route from Middletown to
Gettysburg, via Rocky Ridge and Emmits- I
burg, as compared with that one via Ca'.otliu
Furnaces, Meehanicstown and Einmilshurg *
is wliolly impracticable, viewed either from
Ihe standpoint of cost of construction or
from that of paying traffle when completed.
First: the Rocky Ridge route will he the
longer of the two ; again, a survey lias been
made by the former route and this need only
he compared with any possible route via ‘
Rocky Ridge to show that in the matter of 1
bridges and approaches to the three streams, 1
Fishing Creek, Hunting Creek and Owens 1
Creek, alone, the lower route is nnpractica- 1
hie. These stieams on any line reaching 1
Rocky Ridge arc hounded on one or both
sides by immense ridges of red ro k, the -
valleys great depressions and the interlying
spaces irregular summits every one of under
lying red rock to any depth necessary to go i
to secure the grade; to bridge and approach ; i
the three streams alone, by the lower route, 1 i
would, in the judgment ol one conversant j
wilh both routes and informed in matters of ■
this kind, more than build the road lied 1
from Catoelin Furnaces to Yellow hirings.
A glance at the map ot any geodetic survey
will convince any one of Hie evenness of the !
lines of equal altitude at the immediate base j
of i he Ca loci in Spur and every one acquaint
cd with the section knows how wonderfully I
broken and displaced is the entire red rock j
strata. In the matter of road lied construe- j
tmii and bridges, the lower route by eompar- j
ison therefore is impracticable; tins puts j
two items against it, distance and cost of j
const met ion.
Again: in the matter of traffic, everything ■
is in favor of the upper route, for necessarily, j
so far as local traffic is concerned, the prop is- i
ed road should consider freight rather than j
passenger traffic. How do the the two routes i
stand ? What is to lie expected from the 1
lower route, which throughout would secure
lint the farm products of a not over-produc j
live licit ? Practically but little. What
recommends the upper route? An unbroken
bed of minerals from Yellow Springs almost j
to Emmitsburg, n> I one ton of which ore can !
Mini a market, except a railroad passes inline- j
dlately hy it. From Yellow Springs to within i
three miles of Emmil.-burg on the upper
route lie a succession of rich deposits ol
magnetic, specular and hematite ores, ochres
and llints, which will be marketable and 1
outweigh, twenty to one, the shipments ol
Ihe lower route. In addition to this the coke
and iron tiafficof (’atoelin Furnaces, which
may naturally lie expected to come under a
nil lie; energetic management ere long, ol
itself is a fair set-off agdnst the traffic over
the iowir route. And the. hulk of the local j
traffic Iliat tlie lower route won d secure, |
would come to (be upper route anyhow.
The development ot the mineral resouiees of
the county can only be. secured by the upper
route and we have shown that this alone j
must be looked to for paying tialflc. This |
makes the third item m favor of the upper
route, i ,
Now, we will consider the sole inducement
that the lower route offers and that Is the 1
seven nillis of railroad from Rocky Ridge to 1
Emmitsburg. It is to save some of the money 1
that lias been invested in liial road, that the
people of Middletown Valley and Monocaey :
Valley are asked to eome to it over unpro
ductive hills and across the deep-sunken beds
Ol Fishing, Hunting and Owens Creek. The :
W. M. K R. eagerly seeks io operate every
branch road that it can get its hands on If 1
there is promise ot profit in it, yet we call 1
attention to the suggestive fact that it does
not operate the E. R it , and why? Because I
it can not lie made to pay and that same
seven miles of road will not pay the propos- -
ed road, while its parallel from Mechanics- ,
town to Emmitsburg will not only pass hy , .
immense and valuable magnetic ore beds, lull ;
will lie within a stone’s throw of Ml. St. ; ,
Mary’s College and will cross Toms Creek ■
simply at a high water elevation and by easy ,
approaches.
To stun up, we desire to see the two routes i
surveyed and estimaUslaid liefore the people |
of Middletown Valley and the oilier sections
interested and when that is done we shall lie
content to have both our judgment and lion- j
esty ot purpose impeached if it does not I
appear that the lower route is wholly imprac- j
tieahlc. {
Railroads are readily built on paper and j
the Middletown Valley people may he relied j
upon to consider both routes, before they , ,
finally adopt either. We do not understand j
that the publication in divers daily and j
weekly newspapers, of their intention to I
build a railroad to Rocky Ridge fixes the j ,
matter; in fact, it does not fix it, but we ,
believe that, if after due examination of the
two routes. Unit cia Rocky Ridge should
prove to lie the more practicable, then via
Rocky Ridge it will be built, for we believe ,
Middletown Valley will build a road to the
Western .Maryland and that the present ,
movement will be the one to do it.
The following extract from an article on 1
the subject, published in the last issue ol the ;
V.dhi/ lieginler, gives an idea of the condition
of I lungs over there :
“Should the road lie constructed from |
Middletown to Rocky Ridge, ahd (lie Em
mitsburg road extended to Getlyshuag, there
would he a direct line from Gettysburg and j
tlie North to Middletown, crossing the
Western Maryland road at Rocky Ridge. ,
We are glad to say that wo have never
seen our people more united or more cnllui
-1 slaslie. over any previous railroad project
Unit ins been sprung here, than they arc
over the present one. We think the time
has at lasi eome when the people of Middle
town Valley are about tired of being com- 1
polled to haul all their produce from 8 to 15 .
miles over the mountain to Frederick or to |
Clnggett’s Station, Washington county, in i
order to reach a railroad station, or to go the
same distance whenever they want lumber. :
