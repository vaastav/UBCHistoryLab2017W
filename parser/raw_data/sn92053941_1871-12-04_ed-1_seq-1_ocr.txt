Washington, Deo. 2. The report of the
Comtuisaiooer of internal Revenue amies
that ibe aggregate receipts from all sources
exclusive ot the direct lax spun lands and
duty upon circulation and deposits of I
national leaks, were, 'or the li.cai
year of 1ST1, $14,011,176. This sum in
cludes the amounts refunded and allowed
on drawbacks, amounting to fb-Ui.-lS.
The Commissioner's estimate of receipts
for the current fiscal year, under the present
law, is $Uj,OOi,000. The receipts from
spirits for the fiscal year ia $46,281,818.
I he amount of tax received on fermented
liquors is $7,159,7-10.
Tho total receipts from tobacco for the
year is f M.i.U'.lT, an increaie of $2,250,-
(jotj over last year. The total amount of
manufactured tobacco represented by j
the amoaot of collection!, is. 105,828,003 lbs. '
The total number of cigars, cheroots, &c.
on which taxes are coileoted, is 1,3:52,11,
357. The increase is due to the recent change
in the law, changing the mode of collect
ing thes3 articles. The Commissioner
favors consolidating the tobacco rate 24
cents if it can be done without loss to the
government, and expresses the opinion
that the present system of exporting from
bonded warehouses cn be finally abolished
to the interest oi'jbc,;h t lie government and
manufacturers. He recommends that I on
gress provide thst the evidence of loss ot
tobacco at sea 13 satisfactory, and that
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue shal
bve all the force of loding certificates for
tbe purposes of drawbacks.
The want of author. ty to furnish stamps
for condemned lobacoo, which is continually
accumulating, had caused much embarra.se
meut, aud the Commissioner wants Con
gress to auihori.e him, on the requisition
of tbe clbctTs having tbe custody of and
control ot such tobacco, to furnish suitable
revenue stamps to be attaohed and cancell
ed beforv the same is offered for sale, as it
frequently happens that tax paid stamps
are lost from packages by unavoidable ac
cident, without fault on the part of persons
interested ; spirits also, being often thus
"P"""1 wizore. Rsl'af is asked for to
I npnlanl atmh Bi.ivtta V o (uala dMniV
protect such spirits by reita.upin;;.
U wing to Congressional omission to au-
iiorize the remission of tal oa ship build
ers, be has ordered such taxes to be col-
scted. He recommends that the commis
sioner be prohibited from considering or
owing any claim not presented in two
years' time tor tax paid, and all cUims to
be barred in tbe courts aftr six years from
the date of payment of tax.
The report concludes by statins; that 230
aocounts ot ex-collectors are still open, 115
of which hare been placed in the beads ot
attorneys tor smts against tbe Donasmeo o,
tbe delinquents.
Tbe total amount receive I trora compro
mised revenue eases for the year is $648,
497, total value of seizures, $!H5,240.
The renirt of the Secretary of War
shows that the army since July 1st, has been
reduced to :i0,000 men. 1 he expenses year-
l?raabont $10,000,000, tncludtnjf nearlj
$1.000. (KM) for river and harbor improve
ments. The estimate for military purposes
for tbe fiscal year ending Jane 30, 187.1, is
$3,415,472. The l.eaaurv realized for the
preseut hscal year $21.7t6,40:i, from the
sale of arms and other sources aa estimate
of $3,01)0,000 is made for the settlement ot
of claims yet due the States tor calling
troops into service
The Secretary says it is with irreat embar-
BHsmont that tbe appropriations made at tbe
last sesatoo can be made to answer the pres
sing requirements ot tbe service, and re com
mends tbat the extra lieutenants authorized
to serve as regimental quarter-masters be
diaoootinued as the vaoaacies oocur in those
grades, effecting an nltimate reduction of
eighty lieutenants. Be reoommends that the
grade of quarter master asrgeant be abolisa
ed; also those of company artificer and wa
goner, which will save l,lu3 enlisted men
to the service, at J early cost of $412,740.
The proceeds from sales of clothing since
Jane 30tb. 1870, to date, is $1,675,728. The
cost ot transportation for the year is about

fhere seems to be no doubt that a auor-
nm of both Houses of Congress will be pre
sent to morrow. The President's message
will be transmitted directly alter tke Presi
dent shall have been informed by the Joint
Committee that they are ready to reoeive
any communication he may have to make.
Both the message and the report of the
Secretary of the Treasury will be telegraph
to the distant press, bot printed copies of
the reports of the heads of Departments
have been sent ooti d advanoo of their deliv-
Ilia understood that Speaker Blaine has
brought the list of standing committees to
this city, fully made up, and has not con
sented to entertain a change of any im
portant assignment. An nnusnal reticence
has been maintained, and all assertions as
to particulars of appointments are merely
pecolative guessiogs and entirely nnauthor
ized. The list will, it is expected, be an
nounced to morrow shortly after the Home
proceedings commence.
1 he Secretary ot the Iretsary has an
thorized the Assistant Treasurer at New
York to bny one million of bonds every
W ednesday, and sell one million in gold
every Thursday during the month of De
cember.
It is understood in navy circles that the
navy estimates for the fiscal year ending
June 30, is::!, amount to about $20,J00.
000. These are, in the aggregate, mors
than $120,000 leas than those made tor the
current y-ar, and more than $500,000 less
than the appropriations made by Congress
for that purpose. It is further said the Sec
retary will recommend that the grade of
Ccmmedore be dispensed with, and that
after this grade shall have elapsed by death,
retirement or promotion, the present in
cumbent's promotions be made to grade
with Kear Admiral aa vacancies occur from
the list of captains, and that a farther de
crease be made in the officers by increasing
eadetship terms from fonr to six years.
This is reoommended as both m matter ot
efficiency and economy.
