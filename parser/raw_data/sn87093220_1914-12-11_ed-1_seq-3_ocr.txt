Ot
Allow me to speak with great plain
ness and directness upon this great
matter and to avow my convictions
with deep earnestness. | have tried
to know what America Is, what her
IKople think, what they are. what thev
most cherish and hold dear. | hope
that some of their liner passions are In
«ny own heart-some or the great coii
ceptlons and desires which gave birth
to thin government and which have
made the voice of this people a voice
■of peace and hope and llbertv among
the peoples of the world, and that
speaking my own thoughts. I shall, at
least In part, speak theirs also, how
ever faintly and Inadequately, upon
this vital matter.
We are at |»eace with all the world
No one who s|ieaks counsel based on
fact or drawn from a Just and candid
Interpretation of realities can say that
there is reason to fear that from any
-quarter our Independence or the integ
rity of our territory is threatened
Dread of the power of any other na
tion we are incapable of. We are not
Jealous of rivalry in the fields of com
meree or of any other peaceful achieve
ment. We mean to live our own lives
as we will, but we mean also to let
live. We are. Indeed, a true friend to
all the nations of the world, because
we threaten none, covet the posses
sions of none, desire the overthrow of
none.
Our friendship can be accepted and
is accepted without reservation, be
cause it is offered in a spirit and for
a purpose which no one need ever
question or suspect. Therein lies our
greatness We are the champions of
peace and of concord And we should
be very Jealous of this distinction
which we have sought to earn. Just
now we should be particularly Jealous
of It, because it is our dearest present
hope that this character and reputation
may presently. In (Jod's providence,
bring us an opportunity such as has
seldom been vouchsafed nny nation,
the opportunity to counsel and obtain
peace in the world and reconciliation
and a healing settlement of many a
matter that bas cooled and Interrupt
ed the friendship of nations This is
the time above all others when we
should wish and resolve to keep our
strength by self possession, our In till
en»e by preserving our ancient princl
pies of action
From the first we have had a clear
and settled policy with regard to mill
tary establishments We never have
had. and while we retain our present
principles and ideals we never shall
have, a large standing army It asked.
Are you ready to defend yourselves?
we reply. .Most assuredly: to the ut
most. And yet we shall not turn
America Into a military camp We
"Xvill not ask our young men to spend
the best years of their lives making
soldiers of themselves There Is an
other sort of energy In us It will
know how to declare itself and make
Itself effective should occasion arise
And especially when half the world Is
on (ire we shall be cute flit to make our
moral Insurance against the spread of
the conflagration very detlnlte and cer
tain and adequate Indeed
I.et us remind ourselves, therefore,
of the only tiling we can do or will do
We must depend In every time of na
tional peril. In the future as in the
past, not upon a standing army nor yet
upon a reserve army, but upon a citt
zenrv trained and accustomed to arms
it wITT Be rlglit enough, right American
policy, based upon our accustomed
principles and practices, to provide a
system by which every citizen who
will volunteer toi the training ina> lie
made familiar with the use ot modem
arms, the rudiments of drill and ma
neuver and tiie maintenance and sani
tation of camps We should encourage
such training and make it a mentis of
discipline which our young men will
learn to value.
It is right that we should provide It
not only, but that we should make It
as attractive as possible, and so induce
our young men to undergo it at such
times as they can command a little
freedom and can seek the physical dc
velopment they need, for mere health's
sake, if for nothing more. Kvery
means by which such things can be
stimulated is legitimate, and such a
method smacks of true American ideas
It is right, too, that the national guard
of tin* states should tie developed and
strengthened by every means which l
not Inconsistent with out obligation*
to our own people or with the estab
lislied policy of our government, and
this also not because the time or occa
slon specially calls for such measures
but because it should be our constant
policy to make these provisions fot uiii
national peace and safety.

proposed at this time, penult me to

lost our sett possession, that we had

EASY TO DARKEN
YOUR GRAY HAIR
Try This! Mix Sage Tea and Sulphur
and Brush It Through Your Hair,
Taking One Strand at a Time
When you darken your hair with
Sage Tea and Sulphur, no one can
tell, because it's done so naturally,
ao evenly. Preparing this mixture,
though, at home is mussy and troub
lesome. For 50 cents you can buy
at any drug store the ready-to-use
tonic called "Wyeth's Sage and Sul
phur Compound." You just dampen
a sponge or soft brush with it and
draw this through your hair, taking
one small strand at a time. By morn
ing all gray hair disappears, and. af
ter another application or two, your
hair becomes beautifully darkened,
glossy and luxuriant. You will also
discover dandruff is gone and hair
has stopped falling.
Gray, faded hair, though no dis
grace, is a sign of old age, and as
we all desire a youthful and attrac
tive appearance, get busy at once
with Wyeth's Sage and Sulphur and
look years younger. (12)

IMPORTED SEEDS ADVANCE.
Crimson Clover and Hsiry Vetch Seed
Prices Show Upward Tendency.
Prices for Imported crimson clovei
and hairy vetch seed have recently
shown such ii nun ked upward tend
ency that specialists of tlie depart
went of agriculture fear that the cost
of these seed, of which Kurope Is the
hlef source, will interfere with the in
Tensing use of these leguminous cover
■ Tops. In fact, il is feared that the
prices of the seed of these legumes
nay no so high as lo make it inad
■ Isahle to plant them this year
Before the present Kuropean condi
i Inlis arose crimson clover seed was
soiling at from #1 to ■'■'i per hiishel. t'p
:o Any;. I"> there was a scarciiy ot this
seed in the Culled States, owing to the
fact that the receipts from Kurope
were smaller than usual. The prices
then advanced to from to #'.i pel
litlshei Since that dale importations
have continued to 'arrive until there I
now more Imported seed available foi
fail seeding than there was In thh
country a year ago at this time. Tills
seed, according to tin- department's 111
formation, was all imported at approx
Imately the same price as that sold foi
.$4 to $4..'0 per hiishel in the early pari
of the season. The present high price
therefore, is regarded by the depart
ment as unwarranted from the stand
|>olnt of the supply and the import
price of the seed. Some dealers are
continuing to sell at the former price
hut these are exceptions.
If the present high price Is main
tained the specialists are doubtful
whether crimson clover can lie profit
ably used ns n green manure crop for
seeding in corn or on vacant ground
or under other conditions where the
catch is not reasonably certain. Dnilei
such conditions they point out that ii
will lie better practice to sow rye tills

adding nitrogen to the soil in the form
of ii It i'ii te <>f soda or some other higlil>
nitrogenous fertilizer The rye will
afford a winter cover, preventing wash

A somewhat similar condition exist
with reference to hairj vetch seed
There has been approximately six
sevenths as much seed imported since
Nov 1, ISH.'I as In the yeni previ

domestic production of hairy vetch

FALL PLOWING A SAVING.
Thousands ot Dollars Can Be Saved by
Destroying White Grubs.
"If funnel's will plow, us soon us pos
sible. tile ileitis upim which limy intend
to raise next year corn or otUer erops,
which uiv grown in hills, they very
likely will save thousands of dollars."
This is the appeal which James (J.
Sanders, eutotnolgist for the Univer
sity of Wisconsin agricultural experi
ment station, is making to the farmers
of the state.
The saving will come from the de
struction of millions of white grubs,
tiie worm stage of the June beetle,
which are now in the ground aud
which, unless killed, will do untold
damage to young crops next sprlug.
Mr. Sanders predicts that, unless
control measures are soon adopted, the
loss by these pests next season will be
exceedingly heavy.
"As June beetles these pests," says
Mr. Sanders, "do but very little harm,
but next spring, as full grown grubs,
they will be cupuble of doing untold
damage, feeding almost entirely on
living roots, preferably corn, timothy,
potatoes aud strawberries."
While fall plowing and deep disking
are of great value in destroying the
grubs. Mr. Sauders does not recom
mend them as entirely satisfactory
means of eradicating these pests. In
addition to this precaution, farmers
should carefully plan their rotutlon for
next year so as to plant only those
crops which are least susceptible to the
grubs, such us small grains, clover,
vetch, etc., on laud that was covered
with heavy vegetation last spring.

MYSTERY OF
THE STOLEN GOLD
Thief Exposed by the Ac
cused's Sweetheart.
I'liil Houtelle and I worked for assay
era. i lilt was n redheaded, freckled,
generally homely fellow, attentive to
business and despite bis unprepossess
ing appearance very attractive to wom
en Tills I accounted for by bis smooth
tongue.
There came a leakage In the gold
dust passing through our hands, and 1
was suspected of being the thief. Up
to this time Florence March and I bad
been getting on admirably, but now
one day I heard Houtelle pay her one
of his sickening compliments, and
front that time she seemed to be com
pletely under his influence. Then 1
heard that Houtelle bad given evi
dence against me.
The leakage In the dust was very
91111111. lint It was constant, so that In
course or time it must be very large.
The thl<>f hail some method of carrying
It away In Infinitesimal quantities, but
with great regularity. I was called Into
u private office one evening after stop
ping work and searched The other
clerks were put through a similar proc
ess. but nothing was found on any of
us I was put under special surveil
lance. and it was not long before 1 dis
covered that a new man who had come
into llie assaying room and who ap
peared 10 nave taken a desperate fancy
|o me was watching me. He was a de
lective employed to gain my confidence.
Florence March gave me to under
stand that she did not believe 1 was
guilty, but instead of resuming her for
mer relations with me she accepted
more and more i'hil Boutelle's atten
tions. I charged her with her perfidy,
which, though It pained her, made no
difference In her treatment of my rival
aud accuser
Hut one day the tables were turned
I missed Boutelle from his work ana
upon inquiring learned that he had
been arrested the night before. During
the morning I was culled into the otiice
of my employers, and an apology was
made to me for the spying that nad
been done on my movements.
"You have discovered the thief?" 1
asked.
"Yes."
"To a certainty?"
" Yes "
"How was the discovery accomplish
ed?"
"That is a secret"
1 returned to my work and that after
noon passed Florence March on the
street. Now that I was vindicated and
the man she had taken up with In my
stead was known to be the guilty par
ty I felt that 1 could show her my
opinion of her conduct with a better
grace than before. I walked by her
without looking at her.
Boutelle pleaded guilty, so there was
no evidence brought forth to show how
his Iniquity had been discovered. This
was only disappointing to me. One
day soon after he had disappeared
from the world, while I was In the
private office of my employers. I asked
if I would ever know how the culprit
had been discovered.
"Why do you wish to kuow?"
"Because a girl whom I respected de
serted me for him, though be accused
me of the crime of which he was him
self guilty, I am curious to know more
on her account."
"I)o you refer to Miss March?"
"1 do "
After a few words whispered be
tween them one of the partners suld:
"Miss March discovered Boutelle'*
rascality "
I was thunderstruck. "How did she
do it?" 1 asked
"For that you must go to her."
I hurried to Florence. She came
down to see me. maintaining a reserve.
"I am told you discovered tile thief,"
I said "Would you mind telling me
how you accomplished it?"
"I suspected him from the moment t
heard he accused you. Besides, be was
too broad with his compliments. It
seemed to me they were intended to
cover some object"
"Yon mean that?"
"Certainly."
"And why did you desert me for
him?"
"To rescue you from the position you
occupied."
"And how did you do that?"
"I tried to win his confidence, but
failed."
"Well?"
"I can't tell yon any more Yon will
blame mo"
"No" 1 said, now knowing that she
had saved me. "1 will not blame you
I now believe tn you thoroughly."
"Well. I permitted him to become so
intimate that one evening he sat so
near as to put Ills head Just above my
shoulder When I went to my room I
saw something sparkle on my dre«s I
hrnsh"d it into a china cup and It
proved to lie gold dust I gave tile ill

had been cnrrvlng gold dust awu\ t»
his hair, which was of a convenient
color to conceal It. The discovery cane
from his washing his hair every da
when he went to ills room after lenv
Ing the office"
"And why did you not confide iu
me?"
"Yon would have spoiled everything
by making an accusation without a bit
of proof It was very hard for me"—
Her voice trembled. I took her In
my arms, and that Is the end of tbe
story.
