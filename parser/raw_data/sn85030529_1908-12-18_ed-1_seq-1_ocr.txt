buildings wer wrecked and windows
for a block around were shattered.
These wrecked buildings adjoin
the coliseum where the annual First
Ward ball was to beheld next night.
This ball is held for the benefit
of the aldermanic candidate and
brings in from is to S thousand
dollars. It is a kind of wholesale
licensed debauch and the patrons
are supposed to go borne from it in
all stages of drnnkenness.
It is a disgrace to the present day
civilization and would only be
tolerated in the most wicked and
licentious spot in this country.
Had the bomb destroyed the
coliseum, for which it was intended,
it might have been a warning
would have been heeded by
depraved crowds that attend
annual revel of painted sirens

The Panama Scandal.
Probably few people in th's
country place any credence in the
somewhat vague charges made by
the New York World that graft
played an important part in the
transfer of the French equity in the
Panama canal. These charges have
not been definitely formulated, but
for the most part are insinuated in
the question, "Who gt the
money?" meaning the difference
between the alleged value of the
French equity, placed at $12,000,-
... - : 1. ..
000, and tbe $40,ooo,oo pm vy
the United States to the French
government. 1 he insinuation tur-
ther implicates Pres. dent Roose
velt's brother-in-law, Mr. Douglas
Robinson, and Mr. Taft'a brother,
Mr. Charles P. Taft of Cincinnati,
as members of an alleged syndicate
that purchased the French equity
and sold it to this government.
Thas far President Roosevelt has
not answered these charees, save in
a general denial of a most emphatic
character. Mr. Taft, Mr. Crom
well and others have done the same,
which is about as much as ciuld be
epectd of them, without further
fpecification by the World as to the
exact nature of the alleged grafts.
But the president should go a little
further into the ccse, and ordeT a
general investigation of the entire
matter, not as a recognition e-f the
validity of the 'World's charge,' tut
as a rightful concession to the
American pe&ple who are paying
the bill. Such an investigarion is
due, and is 'quite aside fro-ss the;
recent newspaper charges, vrhich
would be refcted incidentally if aU
were found -well.
The !Penana canal is qtte the
largest. .peaceful epcTation this
govenament has ever undertaken,
and it Is oae in which every citizen
fs UUepVy concerned. When the
project ws first broaohecj, it was
popular, -ad there was nerer sercous
opposition to it. Tae .Arnerccan
peeple vecy willingly 'tok up the
additional burden of testation, and
it it only .their due that they should
be inforioed from tcone to time what
prcigreas has been made, ane as
sured tbet their naonef hae been
wwsly speat. That some eatfrava
gaifce hoc marked the management
of the canal there is no donht. The
catJtl con mission is a body of men
who are not, as a rule, engineers or
poce6ed of any cpeoial flualifica
lioa for-euch a responsibility. The
president's personal friend, Mr.
Biifcop. is an exataplr. .However
well he may stand wi ih his associates
and whatever ability hi may have
as a 6us:n?ss nan, if anv, he has
not demo. ii aud any t'ness.fjr his
preieut position.. Aad there -are
many other things that should be
invci(.:atoti. No harm could come
of a reopening f the whole history
of the canal by a comiainee of con
Kress, ana it snouia oe a soicewnat
desirable thing from the standpoint
of President ilooserelt, ho would
experience satisfaction m tureing
over this irreal work frice from li
aJlegatioas of graft.

Ingersoll on Good Whisky
To the Star: In your issue of
The Star recently you published a
Bawling Green (Ky.) dispatch
credited to the Memphis Scimitar,
in which a letter from Colonel Inger
soll to James A. McKensie, is given.
It reminds m of a letter very
similar that was published ten years
ago by Albert A. Sparks,, editer o(
the Mount Vernon, lad. Republi
can, and as the reply was also
published 1 give it here word for
word. The correspondence was
between Colonel Tngersoll and his
friend Dr. Buckley, and' was as
follows:
"Dear Buckley I send you some
of the most wonderful whisky thai
ever drove the skeleton from the
feast or painted landscapes in the
brain of man. It is the mingled
souls ef wheat and corn. In it you
will find the sunshine and shadow
that chaseth each other over billowy
fields, the breath of June, the carol
of the lark, the dew of the nighi,
the wealth of summer and autumn's
rich content all golden with im
prisoned light. Drink it and you
will hear the voice of men and
maidens singing the 'Harvest Home,'
mingled with the laughter of chil
dren. Drink it and you will fee
within your blood the starred awns,
the dreamy, tawny dusks of perfect
days. For forty years thie liquid
joy has been confined within staves
of oak, longing to touch the lips of
man. Your friend, Robert G.
BUCKLEV'S WTIJII.Y.
"My Dear Bob: I jetum te you
some of the most wonderful whisky
that ever brought a skeHetaa into the
closet, er painted scenes of lust and
bloodshed m tbe brain of oa. It
is th- ghost of wheat nd corn, craz
ed by the loss of their natnral bodies.
In dt you will find transient sunl
shrae chased bf a shadow as cald as
an Arctic midnight, in which the
bt;ath of Inn grows icy, and the
ccrol of the lark gyres place to the
fireboding cry of the raven. Drink
it and you skull beve woe, 'sorrow,'
'babbling aaJ -'wounds without
cause. Yut eyes shall behold
ttrange women' and your heart shall
Matter preverse things'. Drink deep
and you tht'll hear the voice of d'e.
f.ions shrieking, wemen wailing and
worse than orphaned children m Bur
ning the lee of father whe yet
(ives. Dricfc it d-p and long and
eerpents will hiss .is, your ears, coil
themselves cbout your neck and
seize you with their fangs. At last,
it biteth like a serpent and stingeitv
kike an adder.'' For forty years this
liquid death has been confined with
in staves of oak, harmless there as
purest water. I send it to you that
.you may 'put an enemy in your;
rcouth to steal awar your brains' J
end yet I call myself your friend
Buckley."
A Part of the Cost.

dynamite in the Panama canal zone
fourteen persons were tilled and
abojt fifty more icjured. Three of
the tilled were Americans. Several
of the injured will probably die and
it is feared there are other bodies
covered up by the immense mass of
rock and dirt thrown up.

W. S. FINCH.
Taft says the McKinley policy
in the Philippines s still to be car
tied out. A wine and humane g3vern
meat po icy in that country, with
out too much free traije is what
those fellows need. Too much and
too little government restraint will
ork harm to both the islands and
Enemies.
Perhaps there are some who have;
no enemies. There are those who
boast that they have none. How
ever that may be, I differ from them
and assert, fearless of being mis
taken, that there is no one, bo mat
ter how perfect he is but who has
many enemies. You remember one
of old said, he had foe without and
foes within. I refer to the foes that
are within us fear, nate, envy,
pride, and others. This first named
is the most powerful and exerts a
great influence over us, unfitting us
for usefulness, robbing us of peace
of mit.d, happiness and health, and
destroying our ability in the duties
of life. If we plan to do sometliini;
to broaden our life, to go out of the
beaten path, we find him there to
block the way, lookir.g so ominous
md dreadful that our hearts sink
and we turn away, glad to reman1
waere we are. lis nils us wi n
-read and despair, and makes lii'
miserable wherever we spend it.
I wonder if you have ever stopped
to ttiink how often you show youi
allegiance to this tyrant foe. Hon
many times in a day do you tay,
"I am afraid?" You are afraid the
Daby is going to have the scarlet
fever. You are afraid that there
will not be bread enough for dinner
or the cake will fall. Yau fear the
weather, disease, custom, fashion,
public opinion. You are so domi
nated by fear that you cannot be
your own sweet, simple self, nor act
out the natnral impulses of your
heart, lest you will not meet the
approbation of your friends, or be
according to their way of thinking
If you would be tree call to your
aid , courage. He will put your
enemy to Might. Courage Is from
God, fear is from the devil. The
Old Testament is
full of it. God
commanded those whom he com
missioned to do great things, to be
courageous and strong. How many
times he repeated to Joshua when
starting into the unexplored land of
Canaan to "Be strong and very
courageous." The New Testament
emphasizes it. Christ taught it in
all His preaching. "Fear not,
"Be of good courage," etc
whatever duty or work comes to
you. do not fear to accept it. Have
courage and even if it seems to you
impossible if it is your work, take
hold of it, trusting for strength, and
you can do it. Courage will lead
you into aoexplored regions of your
own nature and show you resources
that you did not dream of. Ccurage
will give you buoyancy and health
and enable you to accomplish many
things that fear all your life has Uld
you was impossible. Whenever you
are tempted to say, "I am afraid,"
throw
back your shoulders; take
deep full breaths, and without wor
ry, be strong to go forward and fear
will flee from you. KansasFaruier
Congress and the Presi
dent. It seems some of our congressmen
and senators are a little ticklish and
seosative over portions of the
President's message and talk very
seriously of heroic treatment in the
matter.
Our private opinion is that these
fellows had better go a little slow in
this matter. They might stir up a
hornets nest.
,
Cannon.
Well, Cannon it is. Uncle Jne
will dominate the house for another
year.
However, there will be some
strings on him that may, we hope,
have a tendency to cuib his domi
neering disposition and cause hi 111
to see and respect tbe rights cf
others a little better.
