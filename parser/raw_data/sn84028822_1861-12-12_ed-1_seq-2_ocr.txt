The President's Message---Its
The President's Message---Its Omissions and Deficiencies---
Emancipation Colonization,
Etc.
Tlio first Annual Message- of I'rcsldunl I. in
col.v does not coiiiu up to wli.it wo had nx
peeled of him. It In, in many tespects, a
singular document. Of It the Sitilrtmin nays ,
tlio omissions .ml ilultciunclus on sonii) points
nrc as Mtnarlsalilo as Is the want ol clearness
iukI fullness on otliets.
Tlio message gives no satisfactory Informa
tion .is to tho statoof our relations with Hiiro-
pean powers. What h s.ild on tills
toliio
seems to bo chiefly an argm.,6nt adilrened
to those powers to show them that It would
be agilnst their Interest to- (iiterferj In our
national quarrel by siding with Iho ruhjl Con
fedtracy.
It Is strange that not a word Is droprd In
the message about tho proposed intervention
of Kngland, Trance and Spain In the affair
of Mexico. Although tho llects of Ihcsc
powers aro already fitted out and on their
way to take formal i.o.esIoii ol Mexican
potts, tho l'resldent has no remonstraiice to
make, and no indications to glvo as lo what
should bo our course In regard to tbe.se "tJ-
gioislous upon a sister Republic.
Although allusion Is made in the message
to events of more tficent occurrence, that
document is cntitely iilent npnii the seizure!
of Miso.v and Sl.iiiKt.t,. It would seem that)
the clicui.ifctaticc was woithy at least ol a
parsing rcinaik, mid sot.iu slight indication as
to whether the Administration was picparcd
to justify tho act of Oapt. 'ilkes In captur
ing tiro rebel Commissioners on board a liilt
isli vessel.
Hut tho most supprlslng nnifssfon of all Is,
that, though the Tresident speaiti of tho loy
alty of Western Virginia, ho does not deign
to mention the organization and proposed ad
mission into thu t'nioii of tho new Statu of
Kanawha. No more Important question than
this will probably come before Congress
thu present sessions jet its coustItullon.il adviser
has no suggestion to oiler as to what
should lie lis course on Ibis and kindred topics.
Those who have been hoping that the mes
sage would ilecl.nu, lu plain, unequivocal
terms, tho nettled policy of the Adiiiinlilr.itliin
in legaid to Iho propriety of omaiiclpallng
and aiming the tlaves in aid of tho Union
cause, must feel solely disappointed. Thu
Tresident says that "all indlspenslblo means
must be employed" lo "preserve ibu L'l.ion,"
but that "we should not bo lu hastu to deter
in t ii u what radical and extreme measures,
which may reach tho loyal as well as tho din.
loyal, aro liullspenslblu." If a now law,
relation to Ihocuiifiscatiun, emancipation and
employment of slaves by tho United States,
should be iiopo3ed, Its -pinpilefy will bo
duly considered." Hut whether any new law
Is needed, or whether any "radical and ex
trenie nieasuies, which may leach the loyal as
well as tho disloyal," will be tegaided
"indlspenslblo," thu Tresident gives Congiess
or Iho country, no sign or lutlmalloii, unluss
by Implication, lu tho part of tint niessago wo
are about to notice.
Tho Tresident senilis to havo in contempla
tion Iho emancipation of slaves on a largo
cnle, and this lo bu accomplished in Iwo
ways first, by confiscation undur United
Stales law; and secondly, by prolublo acts ol
confiscation and emancipation passed by In
dividual States. How to dliposo of these
emaclp.ilcd slaves is with him, as It must
with every other man, a reilous and perplex
lug question, llu proposes the aquisltlou
now territory in some congenial clime, for
thu pmposo of their colonization. It must,
then, of couiso, bo a territory In or near (he
ton Id zono. Hut how and where such Imii
toiy Is lo bo acquired, h MU to indicate.
Must wo fllllhuslur fur It; mid Unit our justifi
cation in a "milllaiy necessity "
This colonization schumo Ii oua of long
standing. Tho Abolitionists lu Iho party
which placed Tresident Lincoln in his seat
will as a general thing, hilterly oppose and
denounce It. They will say that whun thu
blicks aro oneo freed, limy will h.ivo as much
light to slay in the country wheio they were
born and reaied, as Iho w lilies. An attempt,
outhupait of the Government to remove
them without their consent will be ilctiomi-
can as opprcssliu an I cruel at to minimi
them'bjeU Into slivery. The Abolitionists

of men which ordinary lie in resnve, 'out

It is ono thing to conquer nn army; it
is another thing to conquer a people;
and we. should impress tho woild with
tho idea that this war is designed to sup
press treason, not to enslave eight mil
lions of tho descendants of Europeans.
Our cause is right; tho greatest and best
men that livo are with us in sentiment;
tlio shades of distant and almost un re
membered centuries aro looking down
upon us with envy; hut let us not forget
that tho loftiest deeds of men or angels
