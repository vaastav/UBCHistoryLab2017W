THE REFORM PRESIDENT
Between the selfishness of vested I
Interests and the ravings of the
d magogiiOj President Roosevelt In a
Iijglv place demonstrates the cxpcrl
i onto of every honest man These two
arc his Scylla and Charybdls they
are to him as the devil and the deep
5 blue sea Ho says The triumph of
tho mob Is just as evil a thing as the
triumph of the plutocracy uno hates
L the corrupUonlsts but In the sum 0
measure he despises the preachers
j of mere discontent Earnestly striv
Ing to unhorso the former he arouses
the other who seek to excite a via
lent class hatred Roosevelt Is hon
est with what Alfred Henry Lewis
calls a militant honesty Some men
shrink from dishonesty The Roose
i veil type goes out to meet It and
give It battle For this reason he
must speak out against wrong wher
ever he sees It and when ho docs h B
Ands The sinister demagogues who
sometimes seek to associate them
selves with those working for a gen
i nine reform Thus we find him In
ibis message to congress pointing out
f drastic measures of radical reform
end preaching conservatism striking
a blow at corruption and spurning
the demagogua Roosevelt Is a re
> former In every thing but unlike
many who would remedy conditions i
tho presence flf corruption In a body
does not jpondomn the wholo matter
in his eyes Ho Is more like a good
f Burgeon bent on removing the evil 1
fand giving the good part a chance to
heal over This marks him a con i
s structlve not a destructive reformer
> Many good men there are In politics i I
many moro good men than bad But
s9 r there is one In a million with tho
hc courago to undertake reforms not
c because they fear the opposition of
j fhosa they must attack but because
thty fear tho yawping pack of dema
gogues who revel In destruction for
destructions take

4
tilings and do them conservatively
y fearless of the protests of those ho
n
hurts and heedless of the demands
Vpt the visionaries behind has In
< duced him to treat us to an unusual 1
mount of preaching about plain
i 4 moral propositions and his latest
iaessago to congress is no exception i

fashion with tho real and great
evils of tho present system
The reactionaries and the vio =

of joining hands against us
Both assert for stanceXthat
If logical wo should go to gov
ernment ownership of railraods
and the like the reactionaries
because on such an Issue they
think tho people would stand
with them while the extremists
care rather to preach discontent
and agitation than to achieve
3solid results As a matter of
fact our position Is as remote
from that of Ore Bourbon reac
Ytlonary as from that of the 1m
practlcubld or sinister visionary
Wo hold that the government
should not conduct the business
qt the nation but that It should
exercise such supervision as
will Insure Its being conducted
In the Interest of tho nation
lOur aim Is so far as may be to
secure for all decent hard
working men equality of oppor

THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
Every presidents message to the
congress In well worth reading as It
forecasts moro clearly thin any
thing else tho attltudo of his party
during hh Incumbency toward all
public questlonu touched upon it In
dlcates the policy of the admlnlstra
tlon focuses attention On matters of
most Immediate Importance and
last but not least reflects the char
acter of Its author himself
The lengthy message prepared
this time by President Roosevelt for
tho fiftyninth congress Is of more
than usual Importance because this
administration has taken an entirely
new course In Internal affairs en
lessee the scope of our foreign in
tercsts and instituted a number of
public works on which tho views Of
the chief magistrate arc interesting
Tho JapaneseSan InterestingI I
brogllo tho Cuban question the ship I
subsidy and the Inheritance and In
como taxes are the subjects wo look
ed forward to with rntcrest
Tho mcsiiago is Roosovelttan In
style No time Is lost In getting down
to tho meat of the matter It Is writ
ten In terse English It Is frank
there Is nothing of the nations bus
mess too small for executive consld
oration It Is temperate
There are no surprises In the
communication Tho country was ap
prised weeks ago as to Its content
land purport Wo were expecting
something a little more drartlc per
haps about railroads but aro plea
ed to sec how temperate and con
alstent yet persistent the president
Is on that point advising congress to
give more time to the test of the law
but making sure that more power
must be vested In the Interstate
commerce commission Roosevelt
shows tho broadness of his mind and
the clearness of his purpose some
times by stopping in pursuit of a spa
clfloi object to turn attention to a
wrong being done In that very pur
suit lie suggests that railroads
should be allowed to combine with
the knowledge and under the dlrec
tlon of tho commission In order
that they may protect themselves
against the power of monopolistic
shippers
As usual he places his discussion
of the Japanese question on a high
plane and declares In the beginning
that nations owe a moral duty as
well as Individuals lie then dell
crs himself of some sound phlloso
phy that rings true but will not ap
appeal to San Franciscans whb have
the practical side of the proposition
so close to them as ao obscure that

larger view only possible from the
outside and at a distance
The presidents views regarding
Cuba arc well known He favors re
establishment of Independent home
rUle ph the Island but Is ready to
act In the alternative If necessary
Frankly admitting that a former
ship subsidy bill contained objection
able features President Roosevelt
advises congress to pass the senate
bill at least to the extent of grant
Ing a subsidy to build up South Am
erican lines Roots Kansas City
speech makes clear the necessity
The president Is Inimical to tho
perpetuation of swollen fortunes and
would tap wealth protuberatlons
with the lancet of Inheritance tax
He Is wholly IP I favor of It and says
the principle has I been adopted time
and time again
Tho Income tax he looks on as a
means of distributing the burden of
taxation according to tho benefits re
ceived and the protection afforded by
the government Since the supreme
court was close on the question when
It was adjudicated tho president Is
hopeful that a law conforming to the
constitution may bo drafted to meet
the requirements
I All through his message the idea
of centralization plays an Important
part He deslrcs centralization be
cause with his usual Impatience at
delay and Imperfect accomplishment
he realizes that a central govern
ment may do more to remedy wrongs
than 48 states legislating for them
selves He believes tho federal gov
ernment should take up the divorce
question and this affords him any
ether chance to decry race suicide

tor OUR HOME AFFAIRS
With a reference to our home af
hilts the message Indicates that the
presidential mind Is still bent on ro
form but there Is nothing startling
In Its terms and proposals Time was I
when some of the things touched up
on would have excused tho uso of big
headlines We have grown used to t I
them Once we looked upon Roose
volt as sensational and erratic Wo I
know differently now Whercashere
t tofore presidents have given thought
to internal affairs only to suggest
means of developing our commer
cial and Industrial cnterprlsesRoose
alts task Is to regulate themtrim I
them that they may grow straight
and symmetrical
Ho advises a bill prohibiting cor
porations from contributing to the I
campaign expenses of any party Ho
asks that the governments right to 1
appeal In matters of law In criminal l I
eases bo established It exists 1 In
some states and the DIstrict of Co
lumbia Now rich law breakers are
knocking out Indictments and crim
inal proceedings on technical points >
In lower courts leaving their guilt
undetermlnd and the government
without means of pursuing the pros
ecution
ecutionSignificantly
Significantly on this point the
president says The Importance of r
the particular bill In question Is fur
ther Increased by the fact that the
government has now definitely bee
gun a policy of resorting to the crrm
Inal law l In thoso trust and Interstate I
commerce cases where such a case I
offers a reasonable chance of suc
cessThe
The president sees little hope of c t
the labor unions movement to abol
lab l Injunctions In capital and labor
controversies but ho docs suggest a I
remedy for flagrant abuses of the
temporary restraining order an or
der which ho says many judges have
come to consider at a matter of
course whenever prayed for This
restraining order Is entered and of
ten continued until It has accom
plished the defeat of the ends of the
person against whom It Is Invoked I
and won an unearned victory for
tho petitioner In cases where a per
manent Injunction would be de
niedThe oo
The presidents suggestion as to t
the employers liability law which
no doubt will meet with vigorous
opposition In congress would quick t
jly dispense wth the need of factory
land building Inspectors His idea
simply Is to make the employer lia Ln L
ble for all fatalities and casualties in I
t
tho direct line of employment 1
The president reasons that now the
whole community has to bear tho
exp Scof maintaining those made
helpless by Industrial accidents a
whereas the man who profits by the
e8
Industry should bear It lie argues
that If such a law was passed manu l
facturers quickly will provide the
latest safety appliances and charge
I them rto the legitimate expenses of
the business assessing tho cost fi
nally on tho consumers
He urges an extension of tho eight
hohr law and Its enforcement In all 1 i 1
government work Tho child labor
situation also is suggested as a field
for investigation
Citing a loss of 307000000 to
to C10BC94 employes sacs of 143
000000to 117G09 employers In ten t
years through strikes and Jockout er
the president urges the appointment
of a commission for the compulsory
arbitration of labor troubles He
adds that the monetary loss and the
t temporary paralysis of Industry is as

NO SOCIALISM HERE
The royalty system for leasing
coal lands by the government Is ad
vocated by President Roosevelt This
Is not startling Itjs merely business
principles In government and has no
tendency l toward nor rolasion to gov I

from sale all public domains which
