New Mexico Demands State
Ueod of the 57th Congress.
Of Right and In Justice Sew
Mexico Should Bo a State.
Western dining cars are soon to be
supplied with pretty girl waiters. And
thus westward the star of empire takes
its way.
Silver has touched the lowest quota
tion in three years, but it still is worth
over 54 cents per ounce, sufficient to
make it profitable to work all good sil
ver mines.
It is very plain that the more a man
howls reform in New Mexico, the more
does he want to get on the official pay,
roll; county, territorial ' or federal, it
matters not.
There is considerable difference be
tween the Greeks and the people of
Chicago. The Greeks do not want the
Bible translated into modern Greek,
but the Chicago people will take any
translation.
Three thousand bills were introduced
in the house pn the first day of its ses
sion. It looks now already as if all
but the most important measures have
been snowed under unless powerful in
fluence resurrects them.
If the 57th congress does not know
what it is going to do, the New Mexi
can advises some of its leaders to read
some of the New Mexico yellow sheets
wherein they will find their course of
legislation fully marked out.
Denmark declares that it is willing
to sell the Danish West Indies for a
sum ranging between $4,000,000 and
$5,000,000, but somehow Uncle Sam is
not so anxious nor in as great a hurry
to buy the Islands as the Danes think
he ought to be.
It is probable that the omission of
any reference to statehood for the ter
ritories of New Mexico, Oklahoma and
Arizona, in the president's message to
congress was a gentle hint to the many
nf the three territories not
to indulge in so many political fights
and broils.
It is now discovered that the gentle
Filipino, Emilio Aguinaldo by name,
although he has taken the oath of alle
giance to the United States, is engag
ing in treasonable practice and giving
aid and comfort to the insurgents
wherever he can. The average Filipino
will not change much for the better
within a decade or two.
Quite a number of the bills intro
duced in congress thus far are old tim
ers, which have been introduced re
peatedly in former sessions but failed
to run the gauntlet. There is nothing
like keeping at it, and like the New
Mexico statehood bill, some of those
old measures are bound to pass sooner
or later.
The western representatives in con
gress have at last discovered what
they should do to secure needed legis
lation for this part of the country.
They have gotten together and as a
unit will demand recognition for the
west and there is no doubt, as long as
they make common cause, that they
will get it.
The campaign of 1902 in New Mexico
will be one of education. There will be
many new voters in the territory for
the 1902 campaign and these thousands
of new voters can only be reached by
the newspapers. Here is a hint that
can be taken by anyone who wants to
take it. The politician and would-be
candidate for office, who does not take
it will be the loser.
The secretary of the treasury esti
mates that it will take $600,000,000, or
something like $8 for each man, woman
and child in the United States, to run
the country during the next fiscal year.
Mighty big country this judging not
only by Its expenses but also by Its in
come for even expenditures of $600,000,
000 a year will leave a handsome sur
plus when the acounts are closed.
Although but sixty-five per cent of
the territorial taxes actually reached
the territorial treasury during the fiscal
year all interest coupons were prompt
ly paid and all expenditures authorized
by law were met with one or two un
important and small exceptions. This
shows up pretty well for the territorial
administration and is a fact that lies
and fakes made by the opponents of
the administration cannot undo.
Mayor-elect Seth Low of New York
City, judging from newspaper com
ments, will likely make the mistake of
being too independent. This looks bad
for the reform of New York City gov
ernment. " Neither Mayor-elect Low nor
any other man who has been elected or
received office by the efforts of his
friends can afford such a stand. That
sort of a chicken always comes home
to roost.
The charges filed against Governor
Otero by the New Mexico soreheads
have been investigated by the Wash
' Ington authorities and as was asserted
by the New Mexican right along were
found to be utterly groundless. The
Washington authorities If they had not
sized up the New Mexico soreheads be
fore this certainly have done so by
this time.
It may be presumed that the bill for
an enabling act for New Mexico intro
duced by Mr. Rodey on yesterday in
the house of representatives contains
all needed provisions and is all right.
No comment on the same can well be
made until a copy of the bill has been
received and examined.
The "conscience fund" of the treas
ury, recently received a contribution of
$18,000. It is a cabbage to a thousand
dollar bill that this contribution did
not come from any member of the so
called Republican Reform League of
New Mexico.
The reichstag, or the German con
gress, convened on the same day as
the United States congress. The ses
sions of the reichstag, however, will
bo much stormier than those of con
gress for there are almost a dozen par
ties in the reichstag against three in
congress. The reichstag makes laws
for something like 60,000,000 people and
it too will be asked to appropriate
about $60O,OGv,0CO for the next fiscal
year.
Rev. F. Wr. Oakes, proprietor of a
home for consumptives at Denver, Col
orado, is in New Mexico to look up a
site in this territory for a similar in
stitution. Even Colorado people now,
recognize that if Colorado climate is
good for the cure of consumption, New
Mexico climate Is even better, and that;
New Mexico is the natural sanitarium j
of the world, and the New Mexican
may add, Santa Fe is the sanitarium of
New Mexico.
The fact that President Roosevelt
does not refer to statehood in his mes
sage, gives rise to the hope that he
may send in a special message to con
gress on the subject. It is known that
the president believes in statehood for
the territories, and he may want to
give his faith stronger expression by a
separate message on the subject upon
which congress would be more certain
to act than upon a mere suggestion In
the lengthy message sent in yesterday.
One of the best methods to undo the
injury done the country by trusts is to
compel, by law, in the several states
and territories, the annual or semi-annual
publication of their business
transactions in the form of a sworn
statement. If there is one thing trusts
dread more than another it is publicity
of their doings. The Republican party
must handle the trust subject without
gloves and that in a most vigorous and
effective manner. There is plenty of
time to do that before the presidential
campaign in 1904.
The New Mexican's information Is to
the effect that it is not practical that
the through line of the Rock Island,
Chicago & Pacific railroad will be com
pleted until January 15 next; but even
that is early enough. Many new set
tlers are already in the country through
which this road will run and many
more are healed that way. Eastern
New Mexico will in the year 1902 in
crease greatly In population. It is a
sparsely developed section with many
possibilities and will in a few years be
a very important and populous part of
New Mexico.
F. B. Koen has built a dam near
Great Bend, Kansas, which brings the
underflow of that section to the sur
face. He. utilizes a natural reservoir
site and at the expenditure of $200,000
will secure sufficient water to irrigate
100,000 acres. There is no reason In the
world why the underflow of water in
the Rio Grande, Santa Fe and other
river valleys in New Mexico might not
be utilized in a similar manner. If
land that is arid is worth $1 an acre,
land under ditch is worth at least ten
times as much and it certainly would
be a profitable investment therefore to
spend $200,000 to reclaim 100,000 acres.
There still are a few railroads in this
country not gobbled up by the great
railroad trust, but these feel so lone
some that they are looking aDoui co
form combinations of their own. The
latest to do thfs are the Pierce and the
stillwell lines in the southwest. As
President Roosevelt says in his mes
sage, the conmbination of capital and
of interests, or the so-called trusts, are
not necessarily an evil, in fact, they
.,ia Tinned States commercial su
premacy in the world, but they must
be carefully sunpervised by the legal
authorities so that the interests oi ia
public and of- the commonwealth are
conserved. At this date it is impossi
ble, without ruining the commercial
and industrial interests of the nation,
to prohibit the combining or capital
and of property, but it is possible and
practical to compel sucn coramnauuiw
to be in accordance with only the soun
dest business principle and to give
their affairs such publicity tnat iney
will not dare to overreach themselves.
Confirmed Land Grants in the 1st District Must
Be Assessed.
Tn another column of this issue ap
pears a letter signed by jjisinci ai-
tnrnev E. C. Abbott, addressed to ine
county collectors, assessors and boards
of county commissioners of the coun
ties of the first judicial district, inis
communication advises these officials
that monv Innri crrants in the three
counties of Santa Fe. Taos and Kio
Arrlha. that have been confirmed by
the United States court of private land
.iiimi onri thA Hiirvev of whicn nas
been approved have heretofore escaped
just taxation. The district attorney
proposes to furnish these officials with
a list of these grants and will insist
that hereafter they be properly assess
ed nnd taxes collected from them as
the law requires. Mr. Abbott proposes
to do his duty, fairly, earnestly and en
ergetically and he will leave the rest
take care of itself. That is the kind of
a district attorney that is needed and
there can be no doubt, but that his ac
tion will be approved and upheld by
good citizens generally; although tax
dodging land grant owners may curse
and abuse him behind his back. It is
believed with the proper assessment,
confirmed and surveyed land grants in
the three counties named will add at
least $2,000,000 to the assessed valua
tion of these counties. The district at
torney proposes to do his full duty in'
this matter and will invoke the law in
all cases were dereliction of duty and
incapacity characterize the action off
county officials in the assessment or
non-assessment of land grants In his
district.

ADYERTlSlHGjTHE TERRITORY.
The Work Is Being Well Done by the
Bureau of Immigration .
Roswell Register.
The Territorial Board of Immigra
tion has issued small booklets adver
tising the resources and attractions of
a number of the counties in the terri
tory. These booklets have been com
piled and printed under the supervision
of Colonel Max. Frost, secretary of the
bureau, and sample copies of the San
Juan, Santa Fe and Chaves county
booklets, which have been sent the
Register, show that the work has been
well done. These booklets will accom
plish an immense amount of good, as
they give information that is con
stantly being sought for by hundreds
of persons who think of coming to the
territory and write letters asking so
many ciuestions that it is difficult for a
business man to find time to answer
them, while it Is an easy matter to put
a booklet in an envelope and mail it
and thus answer most of the questions
asked. The Register is inclined to
think that the bureau of immigration
can make an excellent use of any funds
It may have to spare, in printing a
generous supply of such booklets for
each county and having them carefully
distributed by the railroad companies
and supplying the business men of
each county with a limited number for
judicious use In answering inquiries
about their respective localities. The
Chaves county issue comprises 10,000
copies of which 6,000 will be distributed
by Mr. Don A. Sweet, traffic manager
of the Pecos system through the agents
of the Santa Fe company. Several
thousand are to be sent by the bureau
to the Charleston exposition this year
and it is intended to issue another edi
tion for distribution at the St. Louis
exposition in 1803.
4 YELLOW SCHEME.
The Truth About That Eepnblican Ee
form Leaeue Petition,
Las Vegas Record.
Some able-bodied romancer has been
telling the San Marcial Bee that a peti
tion asking President Roosevelt to ap
point Fritz Muller of Santa Fe, gover
nor of New Mexico, obtained 1,000 sig
natures at Las Vegas. That statement
is a self-evident falsehood, because
there are not 1.000. nor 500, yellow Dem
ocrats in San Miguel county. Such a
petition was sneaking around the city
for a day or two last week, and the
most signficant fact connected with it
was that it did not contain the names
of half a dozen men who obtain gener
al recognition as Republicans. Aside
from the editors of the yellow sheets
and their satellites, nearly all .the
names w.ere filched from the tombs out
of the cemeteries. The better element
of Democrats would not touch the thing
any more than Republicans, not be
cause they do not esteem Muller as a
worthy gentleman, but because the
movement had its origin with the yel
low sheets and their sorehead allies,
who are as great a curse to New Mex
ico as the plague of lice was to an
cient Egypt. And then, the decent,
honorable people of the territory, re
gardless of political affiliations, are
well satisfied with Governor Otero and
his creditable record as governor ot
, New Mexico, so much so that his re
appointment will meet their cordial ap
probation. Governor Otero's Action Commended.
Tierra Amarllla Republican.
The action of Governor Otero in call
ing attention of assessors, collectors
and county commissioners to the faulty
assessments and the collection of taxes
which has been going on for years and
years, is certainly correct and timely.
The sue-irestion of the governor that
the officials interested meet with the
board of equalization next January for
consultation and to devise ways and
means for the betterment of assess
ments and tax collections, is a good
move also, and we trust every assessor
in every county in New Mexico will at
tend this meeting at Santa Fe. Poor
assessments, no collections and : tax
dodgers Is what has kept Rio Arriba
county in a back seat for bo many
years. If we- have laws let us live up
to them or else have none at all.

The Capital still keeps up its howl
about Governor Otero and Its claims of
fraud and mismanagement of the ter
ritorial affairs. But the Capital gives
no facts or figures as to where the
fraud lies, nor does it make any specific
charges against Governor Otero. Its
whole cry is ring, mismanagement,
fraud, and blood and thunder general
ly. While claiming that Governor Otero
is not a fit man for the office of gov
ernor of this territory, the Capital does
not tell who is the man. Now most of
the citizens of New Mexico seem to be
pretty well satisfied with our present
executive and it seems like foolishness
for the Capital to keep up its contin
ual howl, even if no one outside of the
territory ever sees that paper.
