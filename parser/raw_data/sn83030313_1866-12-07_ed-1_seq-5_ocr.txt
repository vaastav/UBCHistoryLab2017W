day.
We have the followieg summary of details from the
Asia at Halifax and Mm Arago at this port ?
The Paris oorreapoadaat of the London Vol writes as
follows:?
According lo French despatches the time is rapidly
approaching when the relations of Great Britain with the
I'uiled Slates will be mors than UltUcult. This must be
known lo her Majesty's Cabinet if not by the public.
The Western (Plymouth) Neut of November 22, has
the following:?
Recruiting agents fbr the Argentine Republic havojbeen
picking up men Irom among the discharged Guribaidutn
soldiers, whom they have shipped from the Italian |>orts
lo Bordeaux for lurlher shipment lo couth America.
At Bordeaux these unforluuate Oaribaldiaus discover
that they bave been tricked into signing an engagement
in the Argentine lauguage, by which they acknowledge
themselves to hare received rour years' pay in advance,
all hough not a farthing baa been given to them. The
matter la to come before the French courts of law.
The London correspondent of the Manchester Guardian
mentions several circumstances and rumors respecting
the English Cabinet, which, If they be accurately re
ported, Imply that it is w extremis. Lord Derby and his
colleagues, it is said, find themselves in hopeless antago
nism to the majority of the people In Ireland. "The
position seems to grew more desperate every day. One
attempt after another to throw a dying bridge over the
chasm that separates the Derby lie executive from the
mass of the community in Ireland conspicuously fails."
Lord N'aas, who, like Mr. Whiteside and Sir Hugh Cairns,
is "pledged up to the lips to anti-Catholic and anti-tenant
claims for justice," is likely to be got rid of, the writer
eays, by being made Coventor General of Canada. Mean
while the Fenian element is becoming more dangerous
every day; the garrisons in Ireland are being strength
ened, and It is expected, he adds, that there will be a
large number of arrests before Christmas.
Mr. Charles Boxton, M. P., having published two
scandalous letters addressed to him by Lle^t. Brand,
who presided over the Jamaica courts martial, denounc
ing him (Buxton) for his strictures on the proceedings in
Jamaica, the.Admiraity has ordsred copies of the letters
to be sent to Commodore McClintock, In Jamaica, with
instructions that if Lieut Brand ts unable to deny tbo
authenticity of the letters, he Is to be superseded and
sent to Englnnd, as having been guilty of oonduct Incon
sistent with the character of an officer and a gentleman.
The weekly returns of the Bank of France show an
Increase in cash on hand of over fourteen million francs.
The Pari* FWrt'e says the visit of the Empress
Eugenie to Rome Is bv no means given over.
Earl Kussell was among the distinguished English
diplomats in Italy. He was shortly (Nov. 25) expected
at Florence.
It is reported that the meeting of the North Oerman
Parliament has been fixed for February 1, and that the
governments allied with Prussia had been notiUed of the
fact.
A bill had been introduced Into the Chamber of Depu
ties in Berlin regulating the Austro-Prussian frontiers.
THE FENIANS.
Trclnnd Two Dave Before the "Rlnlngr."
The Asia, at Halifax, reports the oxisting situation In
Ireland on the 26th of November?our special cable
telegram announcing the alarming comments of the
IiOndon press on the "rising" was dated in London on
the 2Tth of November?as follows:?
The Fenian agitation was (Nov. 25) again apparent In
Ireland.
The police at Cork had seised a case on board a steamer
from Liverpool, which was found to contain fifty new
rifles with bayonets attached, and bullet moulds, he. A
man named Tracy, In the emplqy of the arm to whom
the case wee add re Med, was arrested.
The naval authorities at Quaenstown salted a coal
laden schooner, from Cardiff, on the suspicion that
arms were concealed among the cargo. She was searched,
but It is reported no arms war* found.
The numerous arrivals from Amelia* at Quaeastown
attracted considerable attention.
At Limerick on the 23d of November ten men were
arrested and large numbers of pikehaads and a large
quantity of bullets were seized.
A man named John MePheraon McQlllivary, supposed
to be an American Fenian agent, was arrested in Dublin
on the 23d, immediately after cashing an American draft
for ?050 oa the Hibernian Bank. ? revolver was lound
on him, but no document*.
The Dublin police are all armad with six-chambered
revolvers.
It is rumored that numerous arrests are to be made at
onoe.
THE MEXICAN QUESTION.
When the Asia sailed the advioes from Paris generally
agreed that Maximilian had quitted or was about to quit
Mexico.
The Honitevr preserved perfect silence as to Mexico,
and this was received as evidence of the fact.
The Paris correspondent of the London Olob* says it
was impossible to obtain in official circles an avowal that
Maximilian had left, but l( was considered morally cer
tain that he had, and that the French government knew
It.
La /Vance says:? Authentic Information Justlflea the
belief that the speedy departure of the Emperor was ex
tremely probable, even if it bad not already taken place.
The Paris correspondent of the Pall Mall OatotU says
the vessels which sail to bring home the troops are
twelve steam transports and eight frtgatee turned into
temporary transports. They will sail after the arrival
of the Mexican mall of October 36.
The I.oodon Times has no doubt that Maximilian has
abdicated, and looks forward to the intervention of the
Washington government as the next step. That inter
vention will be popular, Instead of unpopular, and cheap,
instead af costly. Americans will enter tbo country a*
friends, they will bunt Its anemias down, and thus
render civilisation possible and transform that com
munity into a civilized state. They will have this ad
vantage, too?they will seem leaa like iavaders than their
tredeceseore. Tbia will preserve the name and form the
[exiran republic, and probably leave a native Mexican
as iu ostensible ruler. ?

Tbo bill introduced by Mr. Bcarxck, (rep ( of Ohio, to
Ox the time for the regular meet Inge of Congress, end
made the apectal order lor to day was taken up.
Mr. Hcnmrca explained and advocated the hill. Be
?aid that if It became a law It waa important rhal It
should be enacted an aoon an poaeihle to afford an oppor
tunity to three or four of the Mtatee which had not yet
held their elections for member*, to have extra aeanlona
ol their Ingislalurea to allow elections to he called.
He argued that aa there waa continuity la the
KxecuUve department and the Jud clary depart
raent, there should he like continuity In
the legislative department, instead of which thero was
an Interval of nlno months between the expiring of one
Congress and the orzsnlxallon of the uext It wee not
likely, ho thought, thet the Aral session of Congress,
which waa to meet on the ?th of Marrh, would last
mora than ten, twenty or thirty days, depending on the
exigencies of the country. The bill would glee Con
gress ao opportunity to organise by the electlou of Its
Speaker, the appointment of lie officers and its com
mltioee, and in abort, would put Cnngreea In position to
have, as it were, command of the situation. If Congress
had met In March, 1*04. the oountry would probably
have been saved the disagreement between the Presi
dent and Congress that had led 10 the present difficulty.
Kach Mtr.'o that has been in rrlieldon, accepting gladly
ihu mm birma now offered thera, or lern.o vcrv much
more severe tbaa those, would have been submissively
oltodlenl to the requirements made of H, and would be
now represented In Congress Or, If one were permit'ed
to speculate on the peselbilltier of the past, it was not
at all certain but that the then Vice President, consider
ing the exhibition wheb he made of himself on the 4th
ol Mnrob. would have been to dealt with by Congress
after Its assemblage that It would not have boon trou
bled with any conshleratiou of that charscter now.

Why, that we create s .-rixtou that will oontlnua antil ?

such provision in the bill; h? haa not read it, nor doaa
ha comprehend the amendment proponed; far that
simply provides that, in addition to the present aemtoa
of l uncross prescribed by the constitution, therw
shall bo another session, to begin on tha

that aeasion shall last the bill and the amendment
are equally silent, and 1 suppose the aaselon wtU
continue mil it Congress adjourns I do not auppoaa tho
gentleman wishes us to make any legislation which wiM
prevent Congress adjourning iutt when it pleattaa, either
st Us tlrsL second, or third session. Ho need not ba
afr nd at all that this is done for tho purpose of taking
up, as he expresses It, the President, or taking up an^
body else, or that we are going.to Interfere with any rw
lalloti between htm and Ins colleagues and the President,
which he says consist in their having taken htm up and
his having taken them up for a specific purpose. I be
lieve there waa no taking up at all, and that each took
the other in and not up. (Laughter.) They found II
waa a mutual doliialoa. and are now ready ixirhapa to
separate and dissolve partnership. There ia no objeot la

aa one of the no-ordlnate branches of the govertnenl
undar euch circumstances that no change shall la
any shape corns to the country by reason of aa
interregnum, that loaves suspended the functions of tba
legislative Department during one.third or any portloa
of its time. This is the whole of It. If tn addition t*
this legislation we choose to proceed to other sola tw
which iho gentleman haa alluded, ami which ere not la

prevent aome of that mischiel in which he, by their
connivance |iorhs|is. is engaged, we shell be engaged la
a very laudeble work, and a work which I trust shall ga

is m our power and that seems proper to do.
