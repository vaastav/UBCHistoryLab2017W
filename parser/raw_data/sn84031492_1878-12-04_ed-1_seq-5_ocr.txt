Tho chastising which the Chicago roods hare
iatelv received on account of their discriminat
ing against this city Is already showing a whole
some effect, snd there is much anxiety mani
fested on the part of these roads to correct somn
of the evils complained of. A meeting of the

western, Chicago, Hock Island «fc Pacific, and
Chicago. Ilurllngton «te Quincy Railroads—will
shortly be held to take measures by which ll*a
business from Omaha can be forced to this city
Instead of allowing It to go to other points.
The Chicago & Northwestern lias Just taken a
step In the right direction. It Ims given notice
that it will no longer submit to the differential
rate of two ond a half cents allowed thus far to
the Detroit & .Milwaukee Railroad, but will
hereafter take business via Chicago at the same
rale as ft Is takeli vlft the Detroit & Milwaukee.
This differential'.fate allowed the Detroit A
.Milwaukee has hod much to do with the diver
sion of the Nurthwest'*rn business to Milwau

point Ilian via Chicago. There will he a lively
light regarding tho matter, as the Detroit Jc
Milwaukee will make every effort to retain thu

The facts concerning (he other ateer* exhibited

F troves conclusively that a belter system of feed*
nglortae more rapid growth and earlu-r tnaturlly

AMUSEMENTS.
TITE IIKETHOVRV SOCIETY COX-
CURT.
TTic Beethoven Society gave Us first public
edm ert of the season last evening at McCor
mick Mall 100 large audience, and with a pro
gramme which showed no letting down from Its
previously high standards. The Society turned
out in full ranks, and with orchestra as such a
society should. Now that it has cot loose from
the piano as an accompaniment, It not only lias
the opportunity to attack larger works, but also
to give alt its music with blirhtencd effects and
liner finish. There were about 100 singers on
the stage, tho mala and femalo voices bclug
about equally divided.
The programme opened with Mendelssohn’s
cantata, the 41 thirst Walpurgls Night,” which
has been given once before by the Society,
and was first introduced to the Chicago pub
lic some years ago by the Mendelssohn
Sdciety. Although one of the strongest
and most characteristic of Mendelssohn’s
smaller works, it Is not as familiar as others of
his compositions, ft was written to Oftethe’s
ballad, end was first performed ataGewand
hnufl concert In Lclpslc, Feb. 2, DM3. Kinder
mann taking the bass port and Franlcln Schloss
tbc alto, who Is sold to have sung the pathetic
appeal of the F'rau nut (Jem IVJtr (“Know ye
not, a deed so daring”) with wonderful effect.
Subsequently, when It was produced In Berlin,
Devrlcnt took the boss part, and In this con
nection the following extract from one of the
eump.iscr’s letters to Devrlent will lie of Inter
est: 44 i have (icon writing a Urge composition
that perhaps will one day make some
effect. 4 The First Walpurgls Night’ of
Ooethe. 1 began It simply because
It pleased and excited me: 1 did not think of
any performance. - But, now tliat It Is finished,
I sec that It Is well suited fora largo concert
piece, ami In my first subscription concert In
Berlin you shall sing the bearded Druid: the
chorus sung by . assisted by . I have
written the part of the Dnt d Into vour throstle
(by permission), and you will have lo sing It out
again. As 1 have always found that those pieces
which 1 have written with the least regard for
people have pleased them best, so. 1 suppose, It
will be with this one.” Mendelssohn was right
In hi* supposition. Though seldom herd, It
rarely fulls to please. It I* a composition which
I* highly dramatic and full of color. The earlier
parts of It were written In Home, and partake
of the Influences of Italian skies and atmos
phere, mid the remainder was written during
his long visit to Goethe at Weimar, who fur
nished him with a close analysts of the sen
timent of the poem, which, It Is clear enough,
pictures the first contact of Christianity wills
heathenism. The overture is devoted to a
theme in which Mendelssohn always excelled,—
the transition from winter to spring, which leads
no to a buoyant and exhilarating chorus ( 4 * Now
Mav again Break* Winter’s Chain ”). which 1* a
very picture In tones of the genial Influences of
soring,—ami who could write such spring song*
a* Mendelssohn! This t* followed bv a very
mournful and dramatic solo by the li'uman of
the reop ty who warns the Druids that the prac
tice of their rites will expose thorn to the wrath
of the Christians, tho warning being repented
by the chorus of women. In the fourth num
ber, the chorus of guards, where tire watchmen
disperse to hold the puses and guard the Druids
In the performance of their rites, the dramatic
element gains In Intensity, and readies Its climax
In the almost savago chorus. “ Come with
Torches,” lu which Mendelssohn gave a
free rein to his laney, dashing his
tones together almost Incongruously, and vet
preserving form and harmonv in all these wild
elements by tho strung undercurrent of thu
solemn i>oug of the Druids which runs through
their wild orgies, as well as In tho closing num
bers, which give expression to the horror'of the
Christians. Thu performance of the choruses
was, as a whole, excellent, and, although the
attack Was sometimes uncertain, there was no
lack of power and steadiness when once the
singer* were fairly under way. Tho wild chorus
of the Druids lu the performonco of their nlcs,
so frequently recalling the Incantation effects
on "tier Freisehuet.V’ was admirably given.
Tho balance uf tho chum* appear* to be better
than lost season, and there l» decided improve
ment manifested on the mule side, especially
among the tenors, who are stronger and
steadier. The solo parts were very (airly taken.
With the exception of the alto solo, they arc
small, but thcr were carefully given, es
pecially the baritone work, which Intro
duced a new singer, Mr. Ivan Moran
ski, of New York. He has a voice
possessing a fair share uf power und of very
pleasant quality, and, notwithstanding a hoarse
ness. ho sung with excellent effect and in a very
maslclanlv wav. The alto solo (Mrs. Watruus)
lacked In dramatic force, though it was sung In
fine voice and with a manifest effort to express
its sentiment. Still, the unusual slowness of
tho tempo in which It was taken, and the want
of freedom In lu interpretation, marred its
effect. At the close of the performance, in
which, happily, there are no bolts fur applause,
the uudlcucu greeted It with a very enthusiastic
recognition, and the ladles’ churns proceeded at
once with iluhliißtclu’s “ Water fipritc/' the
exacting and ungrateful alto solo In which was
taken hy Miss Ella A. White. This exccllsnt
singer is entitled to high credit for the faithful
ana legitimate manner In which she brought
out the music In this trying sola it Is a
thankless task, notwithstanding tho character
istic beauty of thu instrumentation, to make
tills solo, with 1U elusive, subtle spirit intelli
gible to an audience. That the succeeded so
well with It allows musical qualities of a Idgn
order, (iade’s joyous and melodious "boring
Menage” closed the first port, and was excel
lently given.
The programme closed with six selections
from 44 Taimhauier,” which were made In such
a manner as tu secure continuity. Thu first was
tho Overture and tho remainder vocal numbers.
Including, (rum the second act, Wo'j'rain'e aria,
44 Thu Evening bur”; the aria tut £.isnlnih %
giving greeting lo the singers' hall uu the
Wurtburg; tho duo between F’litabeth and
lannhauter, lo which her superiority
over Venu* is acknowledged, ami the
following duo tu which she cop
fosses her ' love to her uncle, the
J&uigrat*} all of which lead up Immediately tu
the stirring March ana Chorus, which are so
familiar to all convert-goers. Tho parts were
distributed to Miss McCarthy, soprano; Mr.
SchulUu, tenor; Mr. MuWadu, baritone; and
Mr. Koss. basso. Mbs McCarthy'*
voice was heard to floe effect In her trying work,
and her naturally largu und bruad style and
dignity uf vocalisation aided her in giving a
very remarkable mlurpreution tor one who lu*
uever been on the lyric stage. Mr. ckhultse hod
but Utile to do, but that little was well dime,
and Mr. MeWode created a very deckled imprcs
slun hy his fine tinging of the 44 Evening filar.”
This gentleman has a voice uf excellent quality,
and slugs with good effect, but bu would
bj still mure effective If he would
drop the tremolo, lor which, least
of all, there Is no call in Wagner’s music. Mr.
Koss, who sang the port at the LanUaratu* Ims
a very strung voice, but It is uut pleasing either
in quality or style. The orchestra did some ex
cellent work, especially in the overture, and in
the 44 l*derims' Chorus” the Society aaug with
splendid ellevt.
llOOlißY’f* TIIKATItK.
Around Ihu honored name of Mra. D. P.
Bower* duster recollections of aomu of tbo
most memorable theatrical representations of
tbe past deeade, aud these aye pleasantly revived
by ber present appearance, after a coo*
aiderable interval, la a part ic which
abo bus won wide repute. Her Lady
Avd’ey canoot bo called one of ber
finest creations, but it U certainly tbe ona la
wbicb she has gamed the widest popularity, aud
probably for tbit reason It was placed first In
ber repertory tor tbo present week. This Is a
sort of modern Lady Maeootb, as conceived by
Mrs. Bowers, without tbo |>otent motive that
impelled, or tbe poetic grandeur that Inspired,
tbo action of ' that majestic fiend.
Bbo Is simply a selfish woman
of Iba world, hurried Into crime to secure lux*
urtous ease, aud she becomes a common cut*
throat merely to gain a purpose which Is a mean
aud vulgar on*. There U nothing in tbo char
acter tdlusplru respect, nor to account for ber
conduct, save on tbe theory that sbe Is half*
erased, sud so, as soon as ber villainy Is revealed,
the spcOatur of the drama becomes
Interested only In tbe undoing
of the hideous w rung. Tbs plav
may bo called a strung melodrama. It Is broad
ly »>.u olivu coarsely drawn, uud the churuciur
of the woman Is lone almost inconceivable In
modern English life. Nevertheless the piece Is
interesting, not os « delineation of Hie and
character, but from tlio Interest which always
attaches to the unveiling of a
secret. Mrs. Bowers* portraiture of this
most unlovely and highly Imnrobable char
acter Is undoubtedly the strongest to be found
on the stage to-day. In It sb« looks as voting
and attractive aa we bare ever seen her, and
acts tho part with no abatement of her
singular jmwer. Probably Mrs. Bowers
Is the only woman on the American
stage that muld surround tbe character with
anything like the grandeur that belongs to
tragedy. Shu Is supported by a company of
which there need bo very little said, whether la
censure or pratsc. Mr. J. C. McCollom plavs
the pfirt of Jio'jert Awtteti In his usual vigorous
and somewhat Jerky fashion, tt Is a good speci
men of McCollum's general style, ami
his manner accommodates Itsclt admir
ably In this Instant® to the requirements
of the part, and produces a forcible and
interesting characterization. The (itargt Tat-
Is Mn Southard, a careful actor, who
enacts the little ho has to do wltn sufficient dis
crimination as to Its Importance in the story.
Of the remaining names In tne cast there Is
nothing special to be remarked. The play will
be repeated at tho matinee to-day. This even
ing Mrs. Buwcrs will appear In “East Lynne.*'
HAMLIN’S THEATRE.
Oliver Doud Byron, who Is unquestionably
one of tbe most attractive sensational actors of
the time, is playing at this theatre In a historic
al drama entitled "Hero,” which recounts, In
a loud, highly-colored, melodramatic way,
some of the incidents of the Modoc war.
Mr, Byron personates Dwwiid McKay, who Is a
handsome, gallant, daring, and chivalrous young
warrior, in a way well calculated to “ thrill the
girls and kill the boys,” and the scenes lu which
ha appears arc full of moving incidents, battle
scenes, lore-adventures, and thrillkc. The storr
Is Illustrated by a series of wcll-cxccutcd
pictures, and Is accompanied bv tbe usual
poise of brass bands. As a representation of
very wild Ufa in tho far, far West, it may be
called exceedingly picturesque, and Is well
calculated to amuse people who have never
seen Indians, and who like to look on when
there is a row in progress. Let It lie added
that Mr. Byron’s play Is doing well, by filling
the theatre with Interested sight-seers.

An Indignant American.
An American traveling iu England has beard
so much noucnic about recklessness iu regard
to llfu in the United Btatcs that lie has written
an indignant letter to thu Loudon 'Jima. He
remark* that ibo Royal Ai)iiurium has its huge
doors, strung enough tor those oi a bank, open
ing inward*. Bhuuld a panic occur, those door*
stand a great chance oi helm* Jammed by thu
crowd Inside, On thu evening hu was tiicru,
few of the doors wen* open, and for practical
use most of them might as well have Itceu
brick walls. They could easily ho altered so as
to open toward the street. Instead of being In
{airs, thu doors lor economy of space should be
made to fold In fours hku lusido window shut*
tors. That U Clio way It is managed at thu I’bll
adnlpbht Opera-House, where an uudiencu of
4.UOU persons can be aiseliarged In five minutes.
“ We bate no Lord Chamberlain there,” hu
adds, “to regulate the length of the dresses of
the ballet girls, but uubiic opinion demands a
pro|>er width of exits. Even the danger we
have hitherto bad from the telescoping of rail
road cars U disappearing. New couplings are
now iu use ou lbs I'cnusylvani* Railroad which
1 will prevent accidents of that nature inluture.”
Hu also directs attention to three facts: (I)
The Collins Hue of steamers that piled between
New York and Liverpool, Ib3o to ltv»7, had In
each stateroom, ready fur use, four life-buoys.
If the British steamers curry them, they are
carefully stowed away out of sight In the went
of an emergency. The present American
lino of steamers, Philadelphia to Liverpool, have
what no other ships have—life rafts, as well as
thu usual number of boats. (9) All American
river steamers arc obliged to have a cork float
for each passenger they are permitted to carry.
How UJphtlanrla Was Spread*
.itsaiiJ I I’l.) 3/eu*iiff*r.
A few weeks ago a little glrllu Bt. Albans, who
bad just recovered from diphtheria was taken by
her parents to visit a family In a neighboring
town, bbe slept with thu children in that family,
and shortly aiUrwurd three or four of ibeta were
taken with the malady, and some have since died.
The family permitted relatives and neighbors
to visit them, and the result Is several cases In
the neighborhood. They had public funerals, even
keening the remains of one child an uuusual
title walling for the other one to die, so us
to bury them together; and this also spread the
contagion. The physician was not powerfully
impressed—assume physician* are not—with the
uiuugioOa lL—a:;,r ci the iLieose; therefore,
he did not take the necessary precautions fof the
protection of the neighborhood or of his own
family, and the result Is that one of his own
children has died and another Is dangerously 111.
A lady who went to one of these houses to roba
tho victims for the grave has called at houses in
the vicinity where there are children, without
any change of her garments or any attempt at
disinfection, and haa fondled the children In
tho*c families, apparently In utter Ignorance of
the danger to which she was exposing them.
TEMPEIUNCE.
Rale of Liquor to Miners,
In response to postal-card notices, a meeting nl
the officers, committees, and friends of the Citl
sens’ League for the Suppression of IhC Sale of
Liquors to Minors was held last evening In the
clnb-room of the Palmer House. The aforesaid
postal-cards were authority for tho statement that
there existed a terrible necessity for pushing tM
work of sopprestlon with vigor, and tho recipients
of the notice were earnestly requested to be pres
ent, since business of *lul Importance wotdd bo
presented. The attendance was very fair, consid
ering that the weather of last evening made home
with a cherry fire-place about tho most comforts*
bio spot Imaginable.
Mr \f, W. Dudley was chosen to preside. Mr.
Elmendorf slated that tbe principal object of tho
meeting was to secure the co-operation, financial
and otherwise, of all good citizens, and especially
of the churches. The specific object was to de
vise means to carry on tha details of the work. It
was necessary to hare a number of agents, to em
ploy legal talent to attend to tho salts which
would probably arise lit (he prosecution of this
work of suppression, and to do thin the lyagno
mast have money. Ho spoka In a congratulatory
way of what had been accomplished during the
last year, and said there was room for farther
efforts in this praiseworthy direction.
The Chairman -said tho Executive Committee
had previously reported that 94,000 would beabout
the amount needed to carry on tho work this year,
—that Is, to kueo an agent in each of tho three
divisions of tbe city, and to pay an attorney for
prosecuting the suit". Asa representative of the
Pint Presbyterian Church, he reported that he had
already collected tl'H), and would secure more In
a few days.
One doubting Thomas thought the police ought
to do this work of suppression, and two or three
gentlemen had to repeat what has been said dozens
of times to show him that tbe police either couldn’t
or wouldn’t attend to it. and to otherwise convince
him turn he was floundering about In the darkness
of Ignorance. One of tho speakers, Mr. Pax
ton, said the League bad now come
to tbe crisis in Its existence. The
saloon-keepers had gotten over their first scare and
were fighting the League in the courts on mure
technicalities, generally succeeding, too, no doubt
to the delight of their attorney, who knew the
League would bring tho cases up again, no matter
bow many limes they wore diamiated. and’thus in
crease his fees. Mr. Paxton spoke of tbe nccesatty
of aecuring evidence in these cases. It had been
found that the police could not attend to this along
with their other duties, and It was therefore neces
sary that the citizens of Chicago should give the
League their moral and their active support to us
work to suppress this crying evil.
Mr. Kltnendorf further staled that subscription
books had been scot ont to 160 different pastors,
and the returns bad occo comm? in, rstlior slowly
at first, but more encouragingly now.
The representatives of several cnurches reported
various degrees of progress In Iblsmatterof raising
funds. It appeared for the most part, however,
that the real work was yet to be done, the amount
already subscribed being bat a small part of whut
was needed.
Mr. Uoodipeed stated that a bill was preparing
