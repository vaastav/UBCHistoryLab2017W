Bouffe Statesmanship.
The president begins his message by in
forming congress and the people that- he
haa nothing to tell them about the opera
tions of the government which they do
not already know. What follows estab
lishes the truth of this preliminary state
ment The review of cur foreign relations is, as
usual, dull and uninteresting. The fact
is that we are practically without foreign
relations, and what the president says
aboat them is purely perfunctory. Speak
ing of the pan-American congress now in
Eession, the president has something to
tay about "unnecessary barriers to com
merce between the nations ot America."
This language sounds very strangely,
coming from a man who was elected presi
dent on a plati'orm declaring, substantially,
that the more barriers to commerce
between this and other countries which
could be raised, the better off our people
would be. The deluded people who voted
for Mr. Harrison with the understanding
that he would, if elected, at once institute
a hostile policy against England, will take
a melancholy interest in his tame and
even truckling allusions to the very pacific
relations existinz between ourselves and
John Bull, and likely to be continued in
definitely. Mr. Harrison- did all his tail
twisting during the campaign.
Mr. Harrison has something to say
about Chinese immigration. He haa
finally come to the conclusion that "our
supreme interests demand the exclusion
of a laboring element which has been
shown to be incompatible with our social
life." It took Mr. Harrison a very long
time to come to this conclusion ; it is grat
ifying to know that, being president, he
has finally reached it.
The pre-ident introduces his remarks
upon domestic affairs with congratulations
upon the "great prosperity of the country."
"What he says on this subject will probably
be received with great enthusiasm by the
farmers of the country, who are now sell
ing their products at lower prices than for
more than twenty-five years past, and
many of whom are actually using corn for
fuel because it is cheaper than protected
coal. It will also excite strange sensations
in the minds of the tens of thousands of
mechanics and laborers who have had
their wages reduced since Mr. Harrison
became president.
The president's discussion of revenue
questions is really extraordinary for its
weakness and barrenness of suggestion.
Ae chows that the surplus for the last fiscal
year was over 17,000,000 ; for the current
fiscal year it is computed at over $43,000,
000, and for the next fiscal year at the
fame amount, with a probability, accord
in to the president, that this amount will
v largely increased. He admits that a
surplus revenue is a great evil, but he does
not admit, and is, apparently, utterly un
conscious of the fact that the existence of
..his surplus is not nearly so great an evil
as the tremendous burdens which the sys
tem of taxation under which it is accumu
lated imposes upon the American people.
He makes no suggestion looking to the
lightening of these burdens. He does
not propose the repeal of a single
penny of the onerous taxes on the neces
caries of life, under which the American
people are staggering, or of the burden
tome imposts upon the raw materials of
our manufactures which are crippling bo
many of the most important industries of
the country, depriving American labor of
the employment to which it is entitled
and building up a small number of great
fortunes at the expense of the masses of
the American people. He carefully avoids
any direct reference to the wool question,
and contents himself with saying, in gen
eral terms, that "the protective principle
should be maintained and fairly applied
to the products of our farms as well
as our shops." A more demagogical
and dishonest utterance than this
was never made by a president of
the United States in a state paper. Mr.
Harrison knows, of course, that it is not
possible by legislation to protect the
products of our farms, because for such
producta the American farmer already
monopolizes the home market and is
obliged to seek foreign markets for his sur
plus, the price of w hich determines the
price which he receives at home.
The president's talk about applying the
protective principle to the products of our
farms presumes an amount of ignorance
and credulity in our agricultural popula
tion which, judging from recent events,
does not exist. The president also talks
about "the disabilities and limitations
which the processes of reduction put upon
both capital and labor." In other
words, the president believes, or pre
tends to beieive, that reducing taxes "dis
ables" and "limits" capital and labor.
The proposition is an affront to com
mon sense, but we suppose the republican
organs will applaud the president's state
ment of it as statesmanlike. The only
reduction of taxes which the president
ventures to recommend is the repeal of
the internal tax on tobacco, and spirits
used in the manufactures and arts, and
the addition to the free list in the tariff
mchedulea of such articles as do not come
into "injurious competition" with articles
of home production. The president care
fully avoids specifying these articles. His
treatment of the whole revenue question
is demagogical, evasive, and cowardly.
"What a contrast his weak ntterances upon
thin, the one vital issue of the hour,
present to the bold, unequivocal and
statesmanlike utterances of Grovek
Cleveland upon the game subject in his
last two messages!
The president deprecates the policy of
depositing the treasury surplus in national
bank?, and intimates that ho will abandon
it some time if circumstances permit. He
Mtys nothing, however, against this policy
vhich was cot said much better and more
effectively by President Cleveland in his
message of 1SS7.
The president's treatment of the silver
oncbiion will create great disgust in the
new states. He shows more courage upon
this point than any otheT which he touches
in his message. Evidently, Wall-st. has
been bracing him up. He opposes not
only free coinage, but the coinage
ol the full amount of $4,000,000
per month in standard dollars,
authorized by the existing law.
He says, in substance, that we are coining
all the silver now that we can absorb ;
that any material increase in the coinage
will invite financial disaster. He 6ays the
secretary of the treasury Las a scheme for
the issuance of notes or certificates upon
the deposits of silver bullion to the
amount of the market value of the latter.
The president thinks that he approves this
project, but is not quit? sure because he
has not had time to investigate it thor
oughly. It is tier: iti cant that he uses tho
jargon of the gold-bugs throughout, speak
in?, for instance, of the bullion value of
the standard dollar as ninety-three cents.
He means, of course, ninety-three cents in i
gold. The fact is, however, that a standard
dollar not only has a value of one hundred j
cents, but it one hundred cents. Neither
morally nor legally is the gold dollar the
standard bv which the silver dollar is to
be measured. I
The president is sure we want to expend J
a good many millions on our coast defenses ;
a good many millions more on subsidies
to steamship lines; a good many millions
more on rivers and harbors anil still more
millions on the "Blair bill." Anything to
get rid of the surplus and avoid reducing
taxationup on the necessaries of life! For
subsidies, to which the president claimed
only a few years ago to be "unalterably
opposed," he has no better argument than
that England and other European coun
tries give subsidies, and therefore we
should. lie does not favor an "American
policy" on this question as on the tariff.
If the argument that because England
gives subsidies the United States should
do so is a good one, it would also
le a good argument that because England
levies no protective tax, neither should
the United States. Mr. Harrison ami his
supporters during the last campaign made
a very strong bid for votes upon the
grounds that they were hostile to every
thing English; now ho asks us to subsi
dize our steamship lines because it is
English, you know. It is very funny. As
a matter of fact England gives no subsidies
to her steamship lines, as Mr. Harrison
must know, if he ha.s read Consul-Gen.
New's recent report to the state depart
ment. Even if she did, it would be no suf
ficient reason why the United States should
pursue the same policy. England levies
no taxes upon the materials that go into a
ship and she does not prohibit her people
from buying ships wherever they can get
them the cheapest. If the United States
would follow her example in this respect,
as President Cleveland urged, we should
soon rival England on the high seas and
without taking the people's money and
giving it by the million to capitalists fur
building and operating steamships.
There is not much else in the president's
message which calls for comment, except
the allusions to trusts. Mr. Harrison
professes to be bitterly opposed to these
"little private alfairs," as his secretary of
state termed them last year, aiul even goes
so far as to recommend penal legislation
against them. It is a pafe recommendation
to make to this congress, as the president
well knows. It is a republican congress
in both houses, composed very largely,
especially in the upper chamber, of men
who are connected with or are attorneys
for trusts. There will be no national legis
lation against these conspiracies until con
gress is again denmerattc in both branches.
Secretary Windom's Order.
Mr. Harrison has been president nine
months and his secretary of the treasury
finally announces with a great flourish of
trumpets that the national bank deposits
are to be reduced and the number of bank
depositories curtailed. His order on the
subject, made public last week, is a very
interesting document. There is loud
thundering in the index, but after all the
order only calls for a withdrawal of ten wr
cent, of the deposits to be made before Jan.
15. He says other calls will be made "from
time to time" but carefully avoids naming
dates.
The order is evidently issued in the hope,
that it will silence criticism upon the ad
min ii-tration for its failure to redeem its
campaign pledges touching the deposits.
But the order comes too late, and covers
too little ground for that. A withdrawal
of 10 per rent, in the bank deposits during
the first year of the administration is of no
consequence. - This reduction does not
equal the fluctuations in the amount of de
posits which have frequently occurred
without attracting any attention. It would
attract no attention now but for the loud
proclanr.ation that is made of it.
The order is made simply to throw dust
in the eyes of the people. It means
practically no change in the existing
policy, until the existing financial condi
tions change. In other words, so long as
there i3 a large surplus in the treasury,
the administration will maintain corre
spondingly large deposits in the banks, not,
perhaps, 'from choice, but from necessity.
In no other way can serious consequences
to the business interests of the country be
averted, as Mr. Harrison realizes now,
and probably did when he was denounc
ing Mr. Cleveland so savagely for doing
that which he himself has been doing ever
since ho became president.
Republicans and School Books.
The course of the Indianapolis Journal
on the school book question has led many
people to suppose that the republican
press of the state is generally hostile to tho
new law' and to the Indiana school book
company. The fact ir, however, that the
law and the company have no etancher
friends than are the leading republican
papers of the state. We believe there are
not to exceed a dozen papers of any conse
quence which the Journal has been able to
lead into the camp of the trust. TheEvans
ville Journal, the Terre Haute Exprtn, the
Fort Wayne Gazette, the Muncie Times,
the Marion Chronicle, the Bloomington
Telephone, the Huntington Herald and
many other important republican papers
aro friendly to the new law and uncom
promising in their opposition to the swind
ling old trust. There are many other re
publican papers, of which the Lafayette
Courier is an illustration, which,
while not specially favorable to the
new law or the new. books, have
steadily insisted, and do n:)w, that the law
shall be faithfully observed, and the !ooks
'thoroughly and fairly tried. These papers
are honestly opposed to the trust, and will
antagonize any movement looking to a re
turn to the old system.
Republican sentiment throughout the
state is, to a very large extent, on the side
of the new law. Intelligent republicans
realize that they have just as much interest
in getting cheap school-books, and in the
emancipation of the schools from the cor
rupting influence of the old trust, as their
democratic neighbors have. They recall
the fact that it was Gov. Hovey who first
officially invited attention to the frightful
extortions practiced by the trust upon the
people of Indiana, and urged the legisla
ture to give the people reliet. They remem- !
ber that many republican votes were
cast in the legislature for the law. They
are aware of the fact that a majority of the
state board of education, which adopted
the new books, declaring them to be equal
in all respects to the trust books, are re
publicans. They know that as distin
guished a republican and as sound a
lawyer as Locis T. Michener, attorney
general of the state and chairman of the
republican state central committee, in an
elaborate and carefully-prepared opinion,
has held the new law constitutional and
mandatory. They know that some of the
leading republicans in the state men long
active in the councils of their party, and
repeatedly honored by it nre associated
seme of them as its principal officers with
the Indiana school-book company. For
these, and for many other reasons, the
better class of republicans and the better
( lass of republican newspapers throughout
the state are almost without exception
friendly to the new law and the new
books.
Their views are forcibly expressed by
the Marion Chronicle, the republican organ
in one of the leading republican counties
in the state. The Chronicle says :
There never was a law passed that met with
such general approval, nnd, although it may
have to be amended in some few particulars,
we never expect to see it repealed, cxeept by a
better one. The object throughout has been
to drive out a lot of pirates who h ive crown
rich through corruption and bribery, and in
this it has been successful. With but few ex
ceptions every school in Indiana is supplied
with the new b.oks, and they will not be
changed rieht away, because no board of edu
cation would agree to it.
Indiana Needs Good Roads.
Throughout the country the question of
roads is being discussed by the press. It
is an important question, and one that
has been two much neglected in the
United States, principally, no doubt, be
cause of the rapid development of our
railroad system. All the countries of
Central and Western Europe have excel
lent systems of public highways. That of
France approaches perfection, and it is
gratifying to know that it is being studied
by American engineers, and not without
good results already. Some of the eastern
states have recently passed laws providing
for the construction and maintenance of
roads on the French system, and it would
be well if other states, including Intliana,
were to follow their example.
Our road laws are monuments of legis
lative unwisdom and our roads, on the
average, are shocking bad affairs. Their
inferiority involves an enormous tax upon
agriculture, retards tho development of
the state, depreciates the value of farming
lands situated at any considerable dis
tances from railroad towns, diminishes
the trade of our cities and towns, and
causes an amount of inconvenience, dis
comfort and profanity every year which
it is appalling to contemplate. There is
no subject to which the people of Indiana
can better devote, their attention than
that of highway building and mainte
nance. We ought to have the French
system, or something very like it, and if
the matter is properly agitated during the
next twelve months, the legislature of
1S91 will doubtless see the wisdom of es
tablishing it.
This is a matter in which both city and
country people have an equal anel direct
interest. A first-class system of roads
connecting Indianapolis with the sur
rounding country would benefit this city
more than any other material improve
ment that could be made, and it would
benefit the farmers who buy and sedl here
in an even greater ratio. Col. Albert A.
TorE of Boston, in an address upon the
subject of roads, recently delivered at Syra
cuse, X. Y., said: "The prosperity of
any city depends largely upon the sur
rounding country, and the better the road
faeilities the faster the country will grow
in population." So the advantage of goc)d
roads is mutual to both city and country.
As a contemporary says:
A road over which a bicycle can ba ridden
with ease and saf.-ty will save hundreds of dol
lars to farmers and others driving heavy loads.
The earliest communities to recognize and act
upon this truth will be the first to benefit by it.
Throughout this state and the whole country
are farms, eiirht or ten miles front the railroad,
whose value is at a minimum, yet which, were
the roads intersecting them of the first class,
would at once rise in value were they twice as
far from steam transportation. Good roads are
a national benefit. All business originates in
natural product which must find its way over
a common highway before it can reach a mar
ket and attain its full value. Smooth, hard
roads, well drained, and easily traversable
through a large part of the year furnish this
outlet, and alone can furnish it. To neglect
the highways is worse than to neglect fences
and woodpiles and weeds.
Recognizing the immense importance of
this subject, The Sentinel proposes to de
vote a good deal of attention to it during
the coming twelve months. We shal
publish detailed descriptions of the man
ner in which roads are built and main
tained in France and other European
countries, and in some of the eastern
states, and will show what other states
have done recently in the way of improv
ing their road laws. Meantime we urge
agricultural societies, farmers' clubs,
boards of trade and business men's asso
ciations to agitate this question, so that
public sentiment will bo aroused, by the
time the next legislature meets, to demand
the right kind of road laws from that
body. This is a matter in which there is
no politics. We can all get together
democrats, republicans, prohibitionists
and mugwumps upon a platform de
manding goexl roads for Indiana, because
we are all interested. Let the good work
be taken up and pushed vigorously all
over the state.
We have received from "A Disgusted
Teacher" some samples of the latest docu
ments sent out by the school-book trust.
One is a highly displayed announcement of
that very important (?) Benton county
decision, and the other is a circular printed
in blue ink, and headed, in large letters,
"Deserving of Careful Consideration by
the People of Indiana The Indiana
School-book Law and the Monopoly Text
books Condemned' This circular gives
an imaginative account, from the liieh-
mond Palladium, of the convention of the
Ohio and Indiana school superintendents
held in that town in October. It will be
remembered that the trust tried to pack
this convention with a view to securing
the passage of resolutions against the
new law and the new books, but
failed. The convention eliscussed these
matters some, most of the Indi
ana members expressing themselves
as friendly to the Jaw and the books. So
strong was this sentiment that the agents
of the octopus did not even dare to offer
the resolutions which had been prepared.
Yet from this circular the contents of
which were prepared and furnished the
Palladium by one of the truest lobbyists,
it would appear, that the convention was
little else than an indignation meeting
against the new order of things. No won
der the teachers are becoming "disgusted."
About two months ago the Indianapolis
Journal announced, editorially and in its
Washington correspondence, that $25,000,
000 of the government depo-its had been
withdrawn from the banks by Secy.
Windom. Now comes the secretary him
self and announces that he is about to begin
withdrawing the deiosiit, and that be tween
now and Jan. 15. he will call in 10 per
cent, of them, or about $4,700,000. At this
rate it will take the secretary cver five
years to catch up with the Journal's
"news" of two months ago.
Indiana does not getthe supreme judge
ship. Both Atty.-Gen. Miller and Judge
Woods are passed over and the honor is
conferred upon David J. Brewer of Kan
sas, who is now judge of the Eighth judic
ial circuit to which position he was ap
pointed by President Artiivk in 1S84.
We feel justified in the suspicion that if
Judge AVoons had that Dudley decision to
make again, he wouldn't make it. The
judge is clearly a victim of misplaced con
fidence. The schxl book trust has openeel its
mud batteries on the Bowen-Merrill com
pany. In its last circular it denounces the
Bowen-Merrill copy-books as "absolutely
worthless." The real objection to the
books is, of course, that they are sold for
half the price the trust has been receiving
for its copy-books. This is certainly a gross
outrage upon the people, and a "violation
of the principles of local self-government."
Wanamaker says that the time has no
yet come for 1-cent postage. He is doubt
less right. But he should explain why the
Chicago convention, nearly eighteen
months ago, declared for 1-ccnt postage.
Was it for the same rt ason that it de
nounced the policy of depositing the
treasury surplus in "pet banks" that is,
to deceive the people?
Gov. Hovey announces in an interview
that he is opposed to the administration's
policy of repealing the tobacco and whisky
taxes. It is hoped that our erratic execu
tive has learned by this time that it is the
republican party which desires to repeal
those taxes, and not the democratic party,
as he announced in his late lamented Elk
hart speech.

THE WAR ON THE FARMERS.
CALL FOR TAXATION AND RESTRAINT.
Prevent Surplus Farm Products Is the Re
publican Doctrine and larmrr Taxed
Until Two lilli n ItreaJ.AYinners
Are Driven OCT Their Land.
We have free trade among ourselves throuch-
ont thirty-eight states and the territories, and
among sixty millions of people. Absolute free
dom of exchange within our dwn borders and
among our own citizeus is the kwof the repub
lic. Reasonable taxation and restraint upon
those without is the dictate of enlightened pa
triotism and the doctrine of the republican
party. Wi'liam McKin'ev, of Ohio.
Mr. McKh.!ey is the republican cham
pion in congress of protection, and thee
words are taken from his chapter in de
fense of protection in the ofiicial "History
of the Republican Tarty" used in the last
campaign.
What does the republican farmer with
common Een.e think of this ''doctrine of
the republican party," if he interprets it to
mean that our congress can imposo "rea
sonable taxation and restraint upon" the
people of foreign nations and that this
"reasonable taxation" can be collected
from the people of foreign countries by
American tax collectors? Is this "doc
trine of the republican party" true?
If the conp-ess of the United States can
"levy and collect taxes" from the people
of Great Britain, France, Germany, end
other countries, it should levy none upon
the 3 per ce nt, of the world who comprise
its own citizens. Its treasury should over
liow from "reasonable taxation upon those
without." Yet we hear no 'complaint
from foreign countries concerning any tax
levied by congress upon the 97 per cent,
of mankind outside our bcundarn-s, or any
tortion of them. "Those without" the
'nited States take no interest in our taritf
laws, except to laugh at our foily in sup
posing; we ran tax any one but our own
citizens, and to deplore our tnort-siehted-tees
in refusing to sell at a profit to our
selves what they want to buy. From what
foreign countries did we receive the sur
plus piled up in our treasury before Tan
ner beg;an shoveling it out?
If this "doctrine of the republican party"
were true, then it would be also true that
any foreign government could impose
"reasonable taxation" upon us. The taritf
is not patented. It was not invented by
the republican party. Foreign countries
have had it from time immemorial, ami if
by means of it they could tax tho people
ot the i. nueci states they certainly wouia
if not all, at least the majority of them j
would. What countries collect "reasona- 1
ble taxation" from the American people, i
and what countries refrain from levyirg
this "reasonable taxation," upon us? it
this "doctrine of the republican party" is
true, it is important that we should know
to what countries we pay tribute as well
as what countries pay tribute to us, and
the exact amount for each, eo that we may
know where we stand.
"We pay England over $200,000,000 taxes
yearly," shouts a 'backwoods republican
editor, before Mr.McKinloy's broad hand
can cover his mouth. '"P.ritish freetrader"
cannot possibly impose "reasonable taxa
tion" upon the people of other countries,
for that would destroy Mr. McKinley's
theory that this imposition upon and col
lection of ''reasonable taxation" from
"those without" can only be done by a
high protective tariff.
That the government of no country can,
without force, compel the remainder of
the world to submit to reasonable or
unreasonable taxation is in accordance
with common observation and experience.
Unless it were true there would be an end
at once of all government. Each govern
ment Mould, in self-defense, try to tax the
others out of existence. Net only the
right but the power of any government to
tax stops at the boundary line. Not only j
the right but the power is limited to the j
taxation of its own people. ly injuring
its own people it can make part of the in
jury fall upon the people ot other coun
tries. China, by forbidding its people to
sell us tea, can make us go without it. The
United States, by forbidding the raising of J
cotton or corn, can make the people of
other countries uncomfortable for a while.
But there this power ends, and every ex
ercise of this power is evil, and only evil
to all concerned.
It is beyond the power of congress to
frame any law that will impose upon any i
person outside of the United States a tax
of 1 cent, and this "doctrine of the repub
lican party" does not refer to any person
who is bodily outside their boundaries.
The "taxation and restraint" is to be im
posed upon citizens who have forfeited
their rights, who have been "bribed by
foreign gold to betray their country,"
"upon those without" anj' rights in the
country.
Every tax, every restraint, every burden
imposed by congress must be borne exclu
sively bv the people of the United States.
Mr. McKinley's words do not deny this,
lie does not wish to controvert it. He
wishes to bo tinder.tool by the ignorant
and careless voter m talking of "foreign
ers," but he wishes the protected mill
owners to know that he is talking of those
American citizens who, by producing a
surplus of no value until exchanged for
foreign products, enter into competition
with the mill owners in supplying the
people of the United States with "the goods
they require.
By "those without" he eloes not mean
the "people of foreign countries although
he frames his words to make the rabble
imagine so. By "those without" he does
mean the 1,S07,4S American farmers who
sell their products to foreigners and re
ceive foreign pay for their labor.
It is "reasonable taxation end restraint
upon" the American farmer solely, which
"is the dictate of enlightened patriotism
and the doctrine of the republican party."
No one else is meant by either Mr. Mc
Kinley or any other republican editor,
speaker or writer when referriug to "those
without."
This this is the real meaning of his care
fully chosen words no (ne can doubt who
will read them again. He divides the peo
ple of the United States into two classes:
(1) Those who exchange w ithin our own
borders with absolute freedom. (2) Those
who exchange without our borders and
are to be punished. So long as the Amer
ican citizen trades and exchanges within
our own borders, with other citizens also
within our own l-orders, he is entitled to
credit and even honor. But the American
citizen who attempts to trade or exchango
with any one leyond our borders becomes
at once a person upon whose "reasonable
taxation and restraint is the dictate of en
lightened patriotism and the policy of the
republican party."
The "taxation and restraint" cannot
touch one hair of any person beyond our
borders. It cannot tax him. It cannot
restrain him. It can deprive him for a
limited time of some advantages he might
otherwise enjoy, but only by depriving
American citizens of like or greater advan
tage's. In its highest form and most pow
erful manifestation the embargo act of
1S07 it is simply non-intercourse. We
can make it a crime for any citizen to sell
to foreigners or exchange with foreigners
at a profit to himself, and com pel foreigners
to buy from or exchange with the people
of houie other conntrv, wiser than we are;
but not one inch farther can we go. If we
do not wish to go so far, if the power
lodged in congress is to be exercised
mildlv, merely to discourage the exchanges
to "check imports," we can jmpo√∂o rea
sonable "taxation and restraint" wa
euch of our citizens "within our own bor
ders," as desire to exchange the products
of their lalor with people ievond 01 bor
ders. That this is "the policv of tie re
publican party" we know. That it is the
dictate of enlightened patriotism" f -ere id
no proof, and it does not conf'' 'o com
mon sense.
Who are the ncopJe in this couVry upon
whom "reasonable tix;tion and restraint"
is now imposed bccrjse they wish to ex
change and lo excl√ºirige the products of
their labor with tin? people of fV.rein na
tions? Are they criminals wh de-ire to
exchange stolen gods, or honet men who
have made more of a certain product thaa
their fellow-citizeri can m-e? '

they exchange was-S74SNM')1, repre
senting the yearly wages of earnings, of
2,000,210 persons, if the earrings of all are
averaged by the known earniii.s of 77 per
cent. The "reanab!e taxation" imposed
upon the exchange avera-jed between lsl
and ISss exucJy Slt.so7,2.n yearly, and
the "restraint" imposed upon tiie ex
change was sy great that S!-I,.'K,324 worth
of the products that went abroad were
yearly inwf-ted abroad in foreign ships,
mills and industrial enterprises, furnish
ing employment to foreigners, because tho
fi nders could not aL'ord to bring their pay
ment back to this country iind have au
average line of per cent. "de ducted from
it at the custom-house. The country wa
drained! of its wealth, of the products of
labor, at the rate of t!'4,"U'.t.:;24, at "tho
dictate t'f enlightened patriotism" and. by
"the pejicy of the republican party." It
is Mr. McKinley's prou 1 boast that since
lS'Wwehave exported, in exeess of tho
value of material brought into the country,
SI, vil.'HVM'H) worth of our products and
l,5:;2,0Oi,t'00 worth of our precious met
als, making a total transfer abro id of our
national wealth of S.',.,0-)o.(.K',)'0, every
dollar of which has been invtsted abroad
to build up foreign nations. To transfer
our national wealth to foreign countries
by encouraging exports and discouraging
imports, by forcing our exjrts of wealth
to exceed our imports of wealth has been
"the policy of the republican party," but
the "enlightened patriotism" is hard to
find.
The people in this country who desire to
exchange with "those without" are our
farmers. From 74 to s.i per cer.t. of all
our exports are the products of agricul
ture, the remaining small amount bein
made up of the products of our oil well,
fisheries and mines. One-half the male
workers in the United States are engaged
in agriculture, and over one-fourth of
these have no market in the United States.
The "absolute freedom ol" exchange Uhin
our own borders and among our citi
zens," w hich Mr. McKinley says thev may
enjoy untaxed and without constraint, has
no value to them. "Our own citizens" d
not want and cannot use one-fourth the
product of our farms. Three-fourths of
our agricultural product is futlicient to
feed every one in the United States, and
one-fourth can be and is sold abroad, the
farmers beinir subject to the "rcas nab"o
taxation and restraint," which it is the pol
icy of the republican party to impose upon
the payment, after it comes into the coun
try and before the farmer receives it.

The war which the republican party has
declared upon the surplus products ot our
American farms is not imaginary. It in
no political "seare," for it is outside the
taritf line on which political parties di
vide. It is an issue far greater than any
that has ever come before the people
of the United State or the people of
any country on earth. Beside it, when it
is "understood, the slavery question was
insignificant.
In lSiiO the republican party, in national
convention, declared:
4. That the maintenance inviolate of the
rights of the states, and especially the right ol
each state to order and control its own amnes
tic institutions according to its own judgment
exclusively, is essential to that balance ot
powers on which the perfection and endurance
of our political fabric depends; and we de
nounce the lawltss invasion by armed force ol
the soil of any state or territory, no matter un
der what pretext, as the gravest of crimes.
InilSSS the republican party in national
ccnvention solemnly declared :
We are uncompromisingly in favor of the
American system of protection. The protective
6ystem must be maintained. The republican
party would effect all needed reduction of the
ublic revenue by such revision of the tariiT
a rs as will tend to check imports.
In other words, it stands pledged un
compromisingly to protect the mid-owners
from the competition of foreign goods im
ported in payment for the surplus product
of our farms. The present tax upon tho
farmer's payment for his eurplus must not
only be maintained, but this "'reasonable
taxation and restraint" now imposed upon
the American farmer mut be eo increased
that bis burden will be too prr-at to bear
and he will fctop exporting leaving tho
land he tills to become the wage-slave of a
mill-owner.
The declaration of war on slavery in
ISijO rang cracked and thin cV. : 1 wi; !i
the trumpe t blast of its eieeh.rJi- r or" v.
on the farmers of lV-vS.
A republican congress and a republican
president propose to begin the war at once.
It will not be directed at any particular
section, nor at any particular farmers, but
at the whole industry in general. Tho
paymeut for our agricultural surplus is to
be taxed until production is limited to tho
needs of the "home market;" until every
poor farmer, struggling along in hopes of
better times, shall "be driven into "other
vocations;" until only enough of those
now rich and prosperous who can etan-l
the strain are left on the land to supply
the "exchange within our own border and
among our own people."
Is this a time for democratic farmera to
lie supinely on their back9 waiting to hear
the news from Washington, or to vote in
the congressional elections one year frora
now? Have they anytime to lose in
awakening their republican neighbors and
friends to a realization of the nature of the
impending crisis, of the fate which threat
ens now to overwhelm one-half the male
workers of the land in irredeemable ruin?
