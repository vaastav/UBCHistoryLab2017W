WHAT CONGRESS IS DOING--
Resolutions. Bills and Other Matters Con.
aldered at the First Session of the
Fifty-Seventh Body. ; -
The senate on the 3d listened to the first
message of President Roosevelt and
adopted a resolution directing the ap
pointment of a committee to co-operate
with a like committee from the house
to consider by what token of respect
and affection congress might express
the sorrow of the nation upon the tragic
death of the late President McKinley.
As a further mark of respect the senate
adjourned.... The members of the house
listened with rapt attention to the. presi
dent's message and at the conclusion
there was an enthusiastic demonstration
on the republican side. On motion of
Mr.- Grosvenor (O.) that portion of the
message relating to the death of the late
president was referred to a committee to
consist of one member from each state to
Join a similar committee of the senate.
The speaker appointed a committee and
then, as a further mark of respect, the
house adjourned.
Practically the entire time of the sen
ate on the 4th was devoted to the intro
duction of bills and resolutions. The
Isthmian canal report was transmitted
to the,senate by the president and several
bills providing for the construction of the
waterway, one of them by Senator Mor
gan (Ala.), who has led the movement
for the canal in the past, were presented.
Senator Scott introduced a bill amending
the Immigration laws so as to require
persons about to immigrate to the United
States to secure from the nearest Ameri
can minister or consul a certificate es
tablishing his character and prohibiting
the landing of any immigrant who can
not, present such a certificate.. Senator
Jones (Ark.) introduced without amend
ment the anti-trust bill which passed
the house during the last session of con
gress, but failed to pass the senate.
Senator Aldrich Introduced a bill author
izing the comptroller of the currency to
extend for a period of 20 years the char
ter of any national banking association
extended under the act of July 12, 1SS2.
Senator Lodge Introduced his immigra
tion bill providing for an educational test
for the admission of immigrants. The
writing test is removed and the new bill
requires only to be able to read In the
house Representative Dick (O.) intro
duced a bill providing that the next presi
dent of the United States and those who
follow him shall be inaugurated on April
30. the day on which President Washing
ton took the. oath of office. This change
is desired owing to the uncertainty of
March weather in Washington. Con
gressman Dick also presented a resolu
tion for a general investigation of the de
nial or abridgement of the right to vote
in certain states, with a view to reduc
ing the congressional representation
from such states. Congressman Miller,
of the Fourth Kansas district, asks for
an appropriation of $100,000 for a govern
ment tuilding at Emporia.
Senator McComas (Md.) made an ex
tended and carefully prepared speech in
the senate on the 5th with anarchy for
his theme. He maintained that congress
had full. power under the constitution to
enact a law punishing with death any
person killing a president, or assaulting
the president with intent to kill, or aid
ing, inciting or procuring such an act.
Senator Hoar (Mass.) said the difficulty
was that assassins of kings and rulers
always gloried in their crimes and were
in no wise deterred by the fear of punish
ment. The most effective remedy, he
suggested, would be to have the civilized
nations of the world agree upon some
desolate spot on the earth's surface to
which all anarchists . who upheld assas
sination or the overthrow of govern
ment should be transported. In such a
community the anarchist could carry out
his theories of living without a govern
ment and the world would be rid of his
presence. Senator Penrose (Pa.) intro
duced a bill for the regulation of immi
gration. The senate adjourned until the
9th The house was not In session.
The senate was not in session on the
6th In the house Mr. Gaines' (Tenn.),
who had Just returned from the Philip
pines, was sworn in. Speaker Hender
son announced the membership of the
ways and means, the appropriations and
the enrolled bills committees. Then after
the introduction of bills an adjournment
was taken until the 10th.
There was a highly dramatic episode
in the senate on tfee 9th when Senator
Tillman (S. C.) challenged his colleague.
Senator McLaurin, to resign with him on
the spot, in order that they might be
able "to wash their dirty linen at home."
Senator McLaurin had arisen to a ques
tion of privilege and proceeded to ex
plain what he charged was a conspiracy
to - discredit him in his own state for
acts and views which did not meet the
approval of certain democratic leaders.
The episode was brought to an abrupt
close by Senator Lodge ' (Mass.) moving
an executive session. Senator Hoar
(Mass.) offered a resolution to authorize
the president to enter into negotiations
with other civilized countries for the
purpose of selecting some island to which
might be transported anarchists. The
resolution was referred to the committee
on foreign relations. Senator Frye (Me.)
Introduced the new ship subsidy bill and
Senator Hoar (Mass.) introduced a bill
giving the United States jurisdiction In
cases of lynching and making the crime
punishable by death. . Senator Lodge
(Mass.) presented In executive session
the report of the committee on foreign
relations recommending favorable action
upon the Hay-Pauncefote isthmian canal
treaty The house was not In session.

"It is urged that no one in Kansas knows

be more appropriate as an ornament to the
