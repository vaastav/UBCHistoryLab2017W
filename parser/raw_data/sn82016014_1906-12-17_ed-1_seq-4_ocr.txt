Noting that Senator Fred Dumont
mlth announces that he sh&U cast his

public to keep its eye on the Judge,
the Parsons Sun says: "That is just
what Kansas has been doing for the
past thirty years and the more it looks
Mt him. the better it likes blra. Judge
Johnston has eiven the state more
years of faithful service and received
less for it than any other man in pub
lic life. A a. lawyer he could have
made tea times the amount he has re
ceived in the, way of salary and today
have been a rich . man instead of a
comparatively poor one in this world's
goods But Kansas has been the
richer by hia service. In addition to
increasing the salaries of the Bupreme
judges the Sun would like to see the
legislature enact a law placing the
justices of the supreme court on the re
tired list after a cer-ain age with a
pension fcr their old age. Instead of
electing Judge Johnston to the senate,
increase the salaries of the supreme
justices to an amount equal to that of
the United States senators and retain
him on the bench where he has so
long: served the state with honor and
v.here he can and will be of more
service to the state than in the senate."
. A GOOD WORD FOIi 1911.
There is usually such a disposition
among other Kansas towns to throw
stones at Topeka, largely from force of
habit doubtless, that Topeka finds it
rerreshing to discover something be
sides a rock coming in this direction.
Topeka has no desire to crowd or be
little other Kansas cities. In fact, To
peka feels that it really belongs to the
rest of the state, being the state capi
tal; and so it has become accustomed to
being the target for the rocks. It ap
preciates other things occasionally,
however, and it is therefore glad to note
these sensible remarks in the Wichita
Beacon:
"The Topeka committee has deter
mined to present its points to the legis
lature and leave the semicentennial
plans in Us hands,
"Topeka realizes that the event is
larger tnan any city can shoulder and
it wisely unloads the proposition upon
the state.
"Just after the election there was
heard a threat that Topeka should be
punished for daring to give a majority
against the Repuoiican candidate for
governor. But probably the men who
uttered that foolish menace have since
seen the absurdity of it.
"But Topeka evidently felt the threat
because she now insist ; that it is the
celebration and not the city of Topeka
that is uppermost. The committee even
goes so far as to say if the legislature
prefers Wichita or some other city to
Topeka, it will be all right.
"Now Wichita would not antagonize
Topeka and if that city showed any feel,
ing in the matter - Wichita would be
more likely to aid" than to hinder. But
If it is a fact that the proposition for a
semicentennial celebration is state wide
and not the least bit local, then Wichita
will reflect before advising the state to
enter upon a scheme which may prove
an expense to the taxpayers.
"No doubt an exposition is a grand
thing for a state and probably the pro
posed one, which should be held at the
capital if held at all, would result in
the long run in profit to the state. It
would simply be spending money for ad
vertising which would come back ten
fold in the following decade.
"But the taxpayers are beginning to
find government too expensive. The
ccst per capita seems constantly in
creasing and the tremendous gain in
assets has been accompanied with cor
responding demands for governmental
purposes. The tremendous growth in
wealth and taxable property does not
cut down the tax rate perceptibly. '
"Where shall the line be drawn?
When shall the knife be used for prun
ing? It seems impossible to cut out any
precedents. Appropriations made in the
past have become fixed and if the line
is to be drawn it must be on untried
grounds.
"It is only fair to add that the Topeka
committee offers a first lien on receipts
to the state to make good the appropri
ation and the committee honestly be
lieves that the appropriation would be
but a loan, but there is no guaranty to
this effect.
"The state should be ready to act this
winter if at all because there Is none too
much time to make arrangements if the
fair is to be held."
This is a fair statement. The legisla
ture should not, and will not, undertake
the semicentennial proposition unless it
will be ji benefit to-the state. There it
no doubt, however, but what it will pay
for itself many times over. The cost
per individual will be infinitesimal, but
the results will be exceedingly beneficial
to the whole state.
The proposition should be carefully '
considered in all its phases, and then
the whole state should pull together to
make the celebration a gigantic success.
TIIE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.
Here is a little Christmas editorial
so full of gentle humor and suund
sense that it must Inevitably find wel
come in the minds and hearts of men.
It is the very last thing in the Decem
ber number of the American Maga
zine: "Christmas comes but once a year,
and the reformer is sorry it comes so
often, because It breaks up with a lit
tle 24 hours of sunshine the melancholy
work of making the world better. I
know what my friend, the Enthusiast
over there, is saying to himself. He is
lamenting the fact that I permit the
frivolity of a Christian festival to di
vert me for a day from the cares and
anxieties of the Responsible Person. Is
there no political meeting in Hoboken
or Coharies that I can attend on the
night of December 25, when by the
Grace of God I hope to be whittling a
turkey? Why should I be beaming
down on my well-fed (or soon to be
well-fed) children, cracking old jokes,
clashing at the savory white meat and
probing for the stuffing, when I might
be addressing a meeting of the down
trodden in some centre of freedom and
tyranny? A few enlightened words
from me might spur indignant citizen
ship to the last superb effort that will
land Hans Machsnixsaus as coroner,
and thus at once abolish poverty, crime,
suffering, boodle, graft, disease, and
lynching in the south. But I refuse to
utter them. I refuse to permit the
Christmas feeling that mounts within
mo to be put aside by any other feeling,
human or political. If there is one man
at that reform meeting on Christmas
night, I say disenfranchise him strike
him from the rolls, deprive him of
speech, reform him into the shape of a
donkey! Nay, if the great Hans
Machsnixsaus Is there himself, if he is
anywhere but beside his own Christmas
tree with a fur cap on his head and
false white whiskers on his chin, then
may he never achieve his crown. May
he never hold inquest on me or mine.
"I agree with you, this is no time for
laggards. We must hasten to the toy
shops. . A grave question presents It
self to the manhood of America. It is,
fellow citizens, what am I going tu
give my wife? Shall our children starve
while John I. Rockefeller gluts him
self on, boiled. milKT ' No,, a ; thousand
times no; they may have indigestion,
but starve? Never! The real issue be
fore the American people today, the
issue that cannot be confused by, false
reasoning or obscured by the hired
scribblers of plutocratic tyranny Is: 'Is
there a Santa Claus?" And when the
masses of liberty-loving people, a vast
majority ef the -peeple, rise in their
might and their - .nighties, and creep
with bare feet into the parlor and see
the stockings bulging,, they will decide
a3 with one voice that there is. They
may not put it that way. They may
just say: 'Oh, look what I got!' But it
will come to the same thing.
"Who-wants to change this spirit for
any ether? Who fails to see in it the
beginning o all ', good work in the
world? The spirit of Christmas, the
unselfish selfishness of giving happiness
and taking it, the desire to do good if it
is only for one day, and only towards
one's own and the beggar at one's gate,
this Is the true source of all right im
provement. You cannot go to the pat
ent office in Washington and take out
a patent that wilt transform men into
angels. The way upward, long and ted
ious as it. is, lies through the hearts of
men. It has been so since the Pounding
of the Feast. And nothing has been
proved more clearly in the political his
tory of the race than, this, that good
will to men has done more to improve
government than laws and wars. Let
us close down our desks for the year.
If you want to find me for another
week, I will be tn the wonderful little
toy shop round the corner."

ister representing this country at the
Austrian court, to dabble in Roman

velt is not .happy it is certainly not
because the circumstances do not
make the situation . strenuous enough.
Holton Recorder.
A GOOD SUGGESTION.
Every teacher, in the higher grades'
of our public and private schools
should have President Roosevelt's mes
sage to congress read and discussed. A
paragraph or section of it could be ta
ken each day. We suggest that de
bates upon the principal parts of the
message, would add interest to the ex
ercises, and would bring before the pu-
pns tne problems which are now con
fronting the American people. These
students in our schools, are the citi
zens ol the near future, and they
should not be permitted to pass out
into the world, without a knowledge
of the great questions which they will
be expected to answer at the polls.
Western School Journal.
GOOD ADVICE.
A man who has said and done less
splendid things than President Roose

FROM OTHER PENS
LET JUSTICE BE SWIFT.
The delays of the law are proverbial.
The delays of California are particular
ly scandalous. The delays of California
law as administered in this city in im
portant criminal cases have been a dis
grace to civilization. It is lime that
this juggling with Justice should cease.
The witnesses are bere. There is no end
of competent lawyers. The public wel
fara demands that the courts give these
cases the right of .way and expedite the
trials. If Schmitz is an innocent man
he should be cleared of the stigma now
attached to him. If he is guilty, lie
should be in the penitentiary. It is not
good for this city that its government
should be headed by a man indicted for
bribery. It is not decent. He should be
placed before a Jury at once. He is re
ported to have stated, in an interview
in an eastern city, that a "majority" of
the grand jury which indicted him had
themselves been under indictment for
crime. We here know that the present
grand jury is composed of respectabla
citizens no one of whom has ever been
even suspected of violating any provis
ion cf the criminal law, and of whom
but one or two have ever been active
in politics. If Schmitz is starting in on
that kind of a defense, the quicker he is
compelled to make it in open court the
better. San Francisco Chronicle.
NEW AT THE BUSINESS.
A man who is described as a "poet
and author" committed suicide recently
In New York. Forty cents was found
on his person. He must have been new
in the poetry business or he never would
have been so downhearted with so much
money in his pocket. Columbus (O.)

Seeking New Things to Grow.
An annual income of 40 million dol
lars on an original investment of S2.000
is the surprising record of the United
States department of agriculture, says
Dewey Sheldon Beebe in the Technical
World Magazine for December.
To the riddle, hy is the depart
ment of agriculture?" some scoffers
have been wont to reply, "Just cause."
They used to ridicule the agricultural
work of the government because, they
said there were no tangible results. But
the department, in its Yearbook for
1905, comes to the front with a "just
cause" for i:s existence. . What busi
ness man in the United States, whether
he fathers a trust or runs a corner
drugstore, can point to a profit like
this: An investment of $2,000 in 1864,
now produces an annual income of
$40,000,000, yet this is one of the rec
ords of the . much-maligned agricul
tural department. The department in
troduced from China and France in
1864, a comparatively small amount of
sorghuin at a cost of $2,000. Now a
considerable part of the molasses con
sumed in the United States comes from
this outlay of $2,000, and the annual
value of the sorghum crop Is at least
$40,000,000.
But the astonishing work of the ag
ricultural department does not stop
with soi -hum. The branch of the de
partment's work which endeavors to
find new things for the farmer to grow,
and to make the United States inde
pendent of foreign countries for all. of
qereals. has been most prolific in
tangible results; and its success in
transplanting alien grains is phenome
nal, and is financially a paying proposi
tion. . . .
Tlie Labor Problem in Panama.
The Panama question Is a public
one, and must be openly and frankly
discussed. It will have to be settled
in the immediate future, and the
country is not likely to be misled by
demagogues. It is not likely that
white labor from the United States
will to any extent go to the Isthmus
to do unskilled work. The great army
of shovelers must be made up of West
Indian black men, or Asiatic so-called
coolies. Neither will the question of
hours of labor as It relates to the
United States have any proper bearing
upon the digging of the Panama canal.
All these things must be worked out
In practical experience on the Isthmus.
The feeling against Chinese labor In
this country has led to an agitation
against the use of Chinese in Pa'nama.
The two cases are totally different, and
ought not to be confounded. American
workmen desire labor under condi
tions of reasonable permanence. They
could not so to the Isthmus of Pan
ama with their families to remain per
manently. In no possible way could
they be made nearly as well off as
they are at home. Chinese' coolie la
bor, on the other hand, is migratory,
can be secured for fixed periods in
large quantities, and ean be handled
on the relay plan. It would be a
highly foolish policy to try to create
Inducements that would persuade
young Americans to leave their fami
lies and homes and go to Panama to
perform common labor for a period of

Secret Wireless Messages.
The greatest drawback to the gen
eral adoption of wireless telegraphy,
says Dr. Alfred Gradenwitz in the
Technical .World Magazine for Decem
ber, is the fact that, the electric waves
being propagated in all directions,
there Is a possibllty of a third party
interfering with the transmission of
messages between two stations or in
tercepting the telegrams. In an au
thoritative article entitled, "Secret
Wireless Telegraphy," the Berlin cor
respondent of the Technical World
J.Iagazina tells of a wonderful invention
by Prof. F. Braun of Strassburg, -who
has perfected a device which enables
the'wire'.ess telegraph operator to com
municate with the proper person with
out danger of others blocking his con
nection or picking up his messages.
Practical tests have been made at the
Strassburg shooting' grounds, which
prove the effectiveness of Prof. Brautfs
invention. This invention places wire
less telegraphy foremost among-military
.methods of communication.

What would Aunt Sophia say? But it
was too late to run back then.
The thought of Sir Richard Ham

their meaningless drawing-room chat
ter produced a reaction from her fears.
A lark it should be, at any cost her
last lark, she supposed. Then &he would
have an excuse in the nature of her er

thought of the object or result of her
venture. She had started out to indulge
a whim.
This new thought was pressed home
to her when, after repealed exhortations
to her faltering assistant, and a series
of tips, even more effective than moral
stimulus, she reached the tumbledown
shanty of the "poah white" family.
Window holes filled with rags, a
smoking fireplace, a slatternly woman
and groups of half-clothed children
were what Polly gathered in her first
quick survey of the room. Then, back
in a dim corner, half partitioned off,
she caught sight of a well-dressed man
bending over a ragged bed.
The young man straightened up and
started for the baskets which Simeon
had deposited heavily in the middle of

"Is there some wine?" he asked sharp

basket. .
