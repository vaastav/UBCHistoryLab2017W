all he proposes. The President's pro- i
poeal for the licensing of corporations '
pp engaged In Interstate commerce 1 am opposed
to. It Ik a paternalistic proposal
that would be destructive of the best
business interests of the country and of
their future development along progressive
lines."
Senator Jones tWash.). Republican?
If the Presiilent had stopped at the end <
of the third paragraph of his message I j
would have thought more favorably of j
It, and If he had been as solicitous a
year ago about the country's Unaneial 1
welfare we would have been In far bet- j
ter financial shape now."
Senator Pittman (Nev.), Democrat? 1
It is a message that still appeals to the
conscience of America in the midst of I
this era of growing fear and selfishSenator
Sheppard (Tex.), Democrat?
The message sustained the high standards
of thought and expression heretofore
set by the man who will rank among
the greatest of American Presidents. It
points out briefly but clearly the supreme
duties of the hour, and Congress
would do well to heed what he sa.vs.
Senator Underwood (Aia.), Democratic
floor leader?I think the President's
message Is aJl right. While the
President did not mention specific questions,
he outlined completely In the beginning
of his message his views on foreign
relations so that every one recog
nixed fels union on m points. The
President's rccommenc for an early
passage of the budget 1/ was also well
put. X think this will tv on he passed.
About the President's recommendation
that a loan bo granted to Armenia I do
not wish to comment until i have studied
the question more. I also agree with the
President in his statement that early indepence
should be accorded the Philippines.
It was a timely and well eon.
strutted message.
Senator Qlasa (Va.), Democrat?Perhaps
the message is more noticeably for
Its omission to say anything about the
peace treaty. This may signify the intention
of the President to leave this
problem to the Incoming Administration
to be dealt with In conformity with the
recent political verdict of the people, according
to the Republican interpretation
of that verdict.
Senator Tliomns (Col.). Democrat?
T think part of the message which relates
to International democracy was
designed to emphasize his devotion to
the ideals of the League of Nations,
notwithstanding results of the last election.
I think he had both the treaty
and league In mind.

Penator "Walsh (Mass.), Democrat?
1 am very glad to see that the President
1s for the Independence of the Philippine*.
I was Impressed after my visit
there a few years ago that they were
reads' for it.
Senator Calder (X. T.), Republican?
T fully sympathize with the Armenians
in their troubles, but in the present
condition of the nation's finance, I do
not believe a loan will be made.
Senator Kellogg (Minn.), Republican
, - -What the President says about the
need for economy Is to say the least
Inconsistent with the appalling estimates
which have been submitted to Congress
oy his Cabinet heads, estimates calling
for all sorts of huge expenditures and
increases In salary. The loan to Armenia
will not be made.
Senator- Wolcott (Del.), Democrat?
The message, though comparatively
short, ehows the President to have the
same grasp on the fundamentals of our
problems as heretofore. If the present
short session carries out any substantial
portion of the programme recommended
by the President, It will have rendered
valuable service to the country.
Senator Borah (Idaho), Republican?
So far as the Armenian loan is concerned.
we had better arrange that the
Allies will restore to Armenia something
on which to make a loan before
we talk about it.
MEASURE TO REPEAL
WAR LAWS REPORTED
Exemptions Agreed To; Up
in House This Week.
Washington*, Deo. 7.?The Volstead
resolution to repeal wartime laws was
favorably reported by the House Judiciary
Committee with an amendment
exempting the War Finance Corporation
act from repeal, in nddttion to the
Uever food control. District of Columbia
rent and trading with the enemy
acta, and those measures authorizing the
Issuance of Li -rty and Victory bonds,
ail of which re specifically exempted
In the resolution as introduced.
Mr. Volstead said he expected the
resolution would be considered In the
House before the end of the week. The
rules committee, he added, will be asked
to give the measure preference and to
agree to a provision for limited debate.
The War Finance Corporation act Is
still In effect, although the corporation
which functioned under Its provisions
has practically suspended operations.
.Possibility that Congress may revive
the War Finance Board to afford relief
to farming and business interests led
the committee to recommend that the
act be exempted from the repeal resolution.
WHY ARMY OF 210,000?
HOUSE TO ASK BAKER
Wants Explanation of Foree
Exceeding 180,000.
Washixoton. Dec 7. ? Secretary
Raker was asked to- lay by the House
Military Committee to appear before it
Friday to explain why the War Department
has recruited an army of more
than ISO,OOP men.
Chairman Kahn of the House Military
Affairs Committee said some committee
members felt that the War Department
hud broken faith with the committee,
explaining that tlio army appropriation
for the year was based on a maximum
of 180.000 men with the understanding
that such a force would be sufficient.
Heports to the committee, Mr. Kahn
continued. Indicate that tne army now
approximates 110.000 men, and that
efforts were being made to reach the
280,000 maximum allowed under the
army reorganisation act. If this were
dons, ho added, a deficit of at least
$100,000,000 would be Incurred.

\\ aelilniftou, l>. C., Dec. 7. (
President Wilson's message to Congress
to-day in full, follows:
When I addressed myself to performing
the duty laid upon the
Th...lJ.n( K,- >,? PnnallfT.tlml In lire
eent to you ati ifiinual report on the
state of the Union 1 foiuitl myself
dominate*! by an Immortal sentence
of Abraham Lincoln's: '"Let us have
faith that night makes might, and In
that faith let us dare to do our duty
as we understand it," a sentence immortal
because It embodies In a
form of utter simplicity and purity
the essential state of the nation, the
l'ultli In which it was conceived and.
the faith in which it has grown to
glory and power.
With that faith ami the birth
of ti nation founded upon it came
the hope into the world that a n- w
order would prevail throughout the
affairs of mankind, an order in
which reason and right would take
precedence of covetousncss and
force, and I believe that I express
the wish and purpose of every
thoughtful American when I cay
that this sentence marks for us
in the plainest manner the part wo
should play alike in the arrangements
of our domestic affairs and
in our exercise of influence upon
the affairs of the world. By this
faith and by this faith alone can
the world be lifted out of its present
confusion and despair.
Kntth Which Defeated Germany.
It was this faith which prevailed
over the wicked force of Germany.
You will remember that the beginning
of the end of the war came
when the German people found
themselves face to face with the
conscience of the world and realized
that right was everywhere arrayed
against the wrong that their
Government was attempting to perpetrate.
I think, therefore, that it
is true to say that this was the
faith which won the war. Certainly
this is the faith with which
our gallant men went into the field
and out upon the seas to make sure
of victory.
This is the mission upon which
democracy came into the world.
Democracy Is an assertion of the
right of the individual to live and
to be treated Justly as against any
attempt on the part of any combination
of Individuals to make laws
which will overburden him or which
will destroy his equality among his
fellows in tho matter of right or
privilege, and I think we all realize
that the day has come when democracy
is being put upon its final test.
The Old World is Just now suffering
from a wanton rejection of the principle
of democracy and a substitution
of the principle of autocrac-y as
asserted In the name, but without
the authority and sanction of, the
multitude. This is the time of all
others when democracy should prove
its purity and its spiritual power to
prevail. It is surely the manifest
destiny of the United .States to lead
in the attempt to make this spirit
prevail.
United Mule* na Exnmple,
There are two ways in which the
United States can assist to accomplish
this great object: First, by
offering the example within her own
borders of the will and power of
democracy to make and enforce
laws which are unquestionably just
and which are equal to their administration?laws
which secure its
full right to labor and yet at the
same time safeguard the integrity
of property, and particularly of that
property which Is devoted to the
development of industry and the Increase
of the necessary wealth of
the world. Second, by standing for
right and justice as towards individual
nations. The law of democracy
is for the protection of the
weak, and the influence of every
democracy In the world should be
for the protection of the weak nation,
the nation which is struggling
towards Its right and towards Its
proper recognition and privilege In
fomllf <f nafinns
The United States cannot refuse
this role of champion without puttin*
the stigma of rejection upon
the great and devoted men who
THE Ni
F THE PF
brought Its Government Into existence
and established It In the face
of almost universal opposition and
Intrigue, even In the face of wanton*
j force, as, for example, against the
' orders In council of Great Britain
and the arbitrary Napoleonic decrees
which involved us In what we
know as the War of 1812.
I urge you to consider that the
display of an 1 mated!ale disposition
on the part of the Congress to remedy
any injustices or evils that may
have shewn themselves In our national
life will afford the most efI
fectual offset to the forces of chaos
and tyranny which are playing so
' disastrous a part In the fortunes of
the free peoples of tnore than ono
part of the world.- The United States
. j Is of necessity the sample democracy
of the world, and the triumph
of democracy depends upon its success.
Budget System In Urged.
Recovery from the disturbing and
sometimes disastrous effects of the
late war has been exceedingly slow
on the other side of the water, and
has given promise, I venture to aay.
of early completion only in our own
fortunate country ; but even with us
the recovery halts and Is Impeded at
times, and there are Immediately
serviceable acts of legislation which
it seems to me we ought to attempt.
J to assist that recovery- and prove
I the indestructible recuperative force
i of a great government of the people.
One of these is to prove that a
great democracy can keep house aa
successfully and in as businesslike a
fashion as any other government. It
seems to me that the first step towards
proving this is to supply ourselves
with a systematic method of
handling our estimates and expenditures
and bringing them to the point
where they will not be an unneces.
sary strain upon our Income or necessitate
unreasonable taxation. In
other words, a workable budget system,
and I respectfully suggest that
two elements are esaerjtlal to such a
system : namely, not only that the
proposal of appropriations should toe
In the hands of a single body, such
a? a single appropriations committee
In each houae of the Congress, but
also that this body should be
brought into such cooperation with
the departments of the Government
and with the Treasury of the United
States as would enable It to act
upon a complete conspectus of the
needs of the Government and the re
sources from which it must draw its
income.
I reluctantly vetoed the budget
bill passed by the last session of
the Congress because of a constitutional
objection. The House of Representatives
subsequently modified
the bill in order to meet this objection.
In the revised form I believe
that the bill, coupled with
action already taken by the Congress
to revise its rules and procedure,
furnishes the foundations
for an effective national budget
system. I earnestly hope, therefore,
i that one of the first steps taken by
the present session of the Congress
will be to pass the budget bill.
Country's Finances Improrlns.
The nation's finances have shown
marked improvement during the last
year. The total ordinary receipts
of $6,594,000,000 for tho fiscal year
1920 exceeded those for 1819 by
| $1,642,000,000, while the total net
ordinary expenditures decreased from
$18,514,000,000 to$6,408,000,000. The
gross public debt, which reached its
highest point on August 31, 1919,
j when it was $26,596,000,000, had
| dropped on November 30, 1920, to
$24,175,000,000. There has also been
j a marked decrease In holdings of
j Government war securities by the
banking institutions of the country,
as well as in the amount of bills
held by the Federal Reserve banks
secured by Government war obligations.
Tills fortunate result has relieved
the banks and left them freer
to finance the needs of agriculture,
Industry and commerce.
It has been due In large part to
the reduction of the public debt, especially
of the floating1 debt, but more
particularly to the Improved distribution
of Government securities
among permanent Investors. The
cessation of the Government's borrowings
except through short term
certificates of indebtedness has beer,
a matter of great consequence to the
people of the country at large, as
well as to the holders of Liberty
bonds and Victory notes, and has
had an important bearing on the
matter of effective credit control.
The year has been characterised
by the prog-essive withdrawal of
the Treasury from the domestic
credit market and from a position
of dominant Influence In that market.
The future course will necessarily
depend upon the extent to
which economies are practised and
upon the burdens placed upon the
Treasury as well as upon industrial
developments and the maintenance
of tax receipts at a sufficiently high
level.
7 1-1! Billions In llonds Mature.
The fundamental fact which at
present dominates the Government's
financial situation is that seven and

1 debt and five billions Victory notes
| and War Savings certlflcates. The
fiscal programme of the Government
must be determined with reference
to these maturities. Sound policy
demands that Government expenditures
be reduced to the lowest
amount which will permit the various
services to operate efficiently
and that Government receipts from
taxes and salvage be maintained
sufficiently high to provide for current
requirements. Including Interest
and sinking fund charges on the
public debt, and at the same time
retire the floating debt and part
of the Victory loan before maturity.
With rigid economy, vigorous salvage
operations and adequate revenues
from taxation, a surplus of
current receipts over current expenditures
can be realised and
should be applied to the floating
debt All branches of the Government
should cooperate to see that
this programme Is realised.
MaUra Plea for Kconomy.
I cannot overemphasize the necessity
of economy in Government appropriations
and expenditures and
the avoidance by the Congress of
practices which take money from
the Treasury by Indefinite or revolving
fund appropriations. The estimates
for the present year show
that over a billion dollars of expenditures
were authorized by the last
Congress in addition to the amounts
shown in the usual compiled statements
of appropriations. This strikingly
illustrates the importance of
making direct and specific appropriations.
The relation between the
current receipts and current expenditures
of the Government during
the present fiscal year, as well as
during the last half of the last fiscal
year, has been disturbed by the extraordinary
burdens thrown upon
the Treasury by the Transportation
Act, in connection with the return of
the railroads to Drivate control.
Over $600,000,000 has already been
paid to the railroads under this act
?-$350,000,000 during the present
fiscal year; and it is estimated that
further payments aggregating possibly
$650,000,000 must still be mads
to the railroads during the current
year. It is obvious that these large
payments have already seriously'
limited the Government's progress
In retiring the floating debt

doubt b? laid before you by the
Secretary of the Treasury and the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
It Is my privilege to draw to the
attention of Congress for very
sympathetic consideration the problem
of providing adequate facilities
for the care and treatment of former
members of the military and
naval forces who are elok or disabled
aa the result of their participation
In the war. These heroic men
can never be paid in money for the
service they patriotically rendered
the nation.
Their reward will lie rather in
realization of the fact that they vindicated
the rights of their country
and aided In safeguarding civilization.
The nation's gratitude must be
effectively revealed to them by the
most amp?e provision for their medical
care and treatment as well as
for their vocational training: and
placement. The time hae come
when a more complete programme
can be formulated and more satisfactorily
administered for their
treatment and training, and I
earnestly urge that the Congress
give the matter Its early consideration.
The Secretary of the Treasury
and the Board for Vocational Education

Aid for Agrlenltsrr.
Permit me to emphasise once
more the need for action upon certain
matters upon which 1 dwelt at
some lenglh in my message to the
second session of the Sixty-sixth
Congress: The necessity, for example
of encouraging the manufacture
of dyestuffs and related chemicals
; the Importance of doing every
tmng possiDie to promote agricultural
production along economic
lines, to Improve agricultural marketing
and to make rural life more
attractive and healthful; the need
for a law regulating cold storage In
such a way as to limit the time
during which goods may bo kept In
storage, prescribing the method of
disposing of them if kept beyond
the permitted period and requiring
goods released from storage In all
cases to bear tbe date of their receipt.
It would also be moet serviceable
If It were provided that all goods
released from cold storage /or Interstate
shipment should have plainly
marked upon each package the
selling or market price at which they
went Into storage, In order that the
purchaser might be able to learn
what profits stood between him and
the producer or the wholesale dealer.

Peace la Indaatry.
In brief, the Immediate legislative
need of the time is the removal of
all obstacles to the realization of
the best ambitions of our people In
their several classes of employment
and the strengthening of all instrumentalities
by which difficulties are
io ue niei anu removeu ana justice
dealt out, whether by law or by
some form of mediation and concill- ation.
I do not feel It to be my priv!
lloge at present to suggest the de/
tailed and particular methods by
which these objects may be attained,
but I have faith that the Inquiries
of your several committees will discover
the way and the method.
In response to what 1 believe to
be the impulse of sympathy and
opinion throughout the United
States, X earnestly suggest that the
Congress authorize the Treasury of
the United States to make to the
struggling Government of Armenia
such a loan as wan made to several
of the allied Governments during the |
war : and I would also suggest that It {
would be desirable to provide in the
legislation itself that the expenditure
of the money thus loaned should
be under the supervision of a commission,
or at least a commissioner,
from the United States, in order that
revolutionary tendencies within
Armenia Itself might not be afforded
by the loan a further tempting opportunity.
