if the farewell benefit and last appearance of
Misi Thompson, the accomplished actress at

Coxiso Down Aqaih. The Philadel
phia Ledger says : Petroleum oil, which rose
so rapidly from twenty-fire eents a gallon to
a dollar and ten, hat taken the back track
"again, and is down, as reported to sixty
eents. The rise was merely speculative and
somebody will make or lose fortunes by the
sudden fluctuation." Fabulons amounts
hare been realised by oil speculators and it
now remains to be seen whether or not they
have been lost by re-investment.
Michigan Tboops Expictid. Captain
Daniel's battery, connected with Col. Cope
laud's Mounted Rifles, will arrive here this
morning at ten o'clock A. M. The 1st de
tachment of Copeland's regiment, (the 1st
Michigan Mounted Rifles, )will arrive during
the day, on the steamer Morning Star. The
Xd detachment will come by rail from De
troit, reaching here to-day some time. The
ii detachment will be sent on as soon as
transportation can be obtained. Col. Gray's
2d regiment of Michigan Mounted Rifles
will follow soon. They all go to Washington
by the C. A P. B. R.
A PcrzLiira Cask. It makes some dif- ;
ferenee, in a person's feeling, we inspect, on
which side of the prison door he stands when
he looks through the iron lattice work. The
sensation produced by looking out, day after
day, may be novel and interesting, bnt most
people prefer to stand on the outside and look
in.
In oar rounds yesterday we visited the
watch-honse. We found a lad about fifteen
years of age, with his face pressed against
the iron bars, looking out. ( If he had " look
ed ont " for himself a little better he never
would have got there.) We asked him what
he was there for. " Stealing boots," was the
reply. He said the man he worked for told
him to grease np the boots, and while he
stayed, wear them. He did so wore them off
and was arrested and locked up.
As we walked away we mused curiously
over the case, in which there is more than
appears at first sight. He had permission
to wear the boots while he stayed with his
employer. Very well. Suppose he hadn't
left his employer's sight for a year and had
kept the boots on constantly meantime,
wouldn't the boots have been worn away t and
wouldn't the boy have been liable to arrest?
Be was arrested for taking the boots off. Ha
had probably taken the boots off fifty times
before and no notice taken of it ; why notice
it in this particular case ? Then again
it could easily be shown that the
boy didn't carry away the boots;
the boots carried him away. Why not
arrest the boots ? His late employer claims
that when the boy abandoned bis service the
boots were to have been left. Well, they
left, didn't they? Another idea; perhaps
the boots were " rights and lefts." Admit
ting that, the boy took no more than his
right and left. Don't you see T Then how
an the man claim the. boots as bis own,
when there is abundant eridenee to prove
that they had been soled.
Thi Ghost Discovxked ! Last evening
s party of resolute fellow, armed with clubi,
bowie-knives and revolvers, started ont on a
search for the ghost. They petroled the
streets in the vicinity of the cemetery for
several hoars. About midnight one of the
party who had got a little ahead of his fel
lows, ran back, hatless and pale with
fright, exclaiming, " I have seen him I I
have seen the Ghost I" His comrades were
seised with a sudden trembling and showed a
disposition to ran. One-suddenly remem
bered an engagement that he had downtown
and started on a ran to fulfill it. Another
said that he had been np late for several
nights and he "thought he'd go home," and
away he scampered also. The remainder
held a consultation and concluded to investi
gate at all hasards. They cocked their re
volvers, loosened their knives, and grasping
their elubs more firmly, crept stealthily, with
chattering teeth, to the spot indicated. They
peered through cracks in the fence inclosing
the yard, and the horrible spectre was reveal
to them, swinging its weird arms in the
moonlight, and nodding its bead in a most
diabolical manner.. All immediately took
to their heels except one bold fellow who
determined to ascertain whether his Ghost
ship was flesh and blood or not. He sprang
over the fence, club in hand. The spectre
did not retreat but continued to swing its arms
And nod its head mockingly. Choking down
bis fear the man raised his club resolutely and
aimed a crushing blow fairly at the spectre's
head. Down went the ghost and down went
the ghost hunter, for his club met with but
littleresistanee. Horror stricken he regained
his feet, when lo I he found that the Ghost
was a woman's night gown which had been
left ont on a clothes line. A night-cap pin
ned on the line at the top of the garment was
what appeared to the excited imagination of
the ghost nun tars to be the spectre s (lead.
Koneef that party desire to have the papers
say anything about It and they probably wont.

want to Lynch him.
We made brief mention in last evening1
edition of the shooting of Orderly Sergeant
John G. Fay, of Smithnight's Battery, by a
soldier. The soldier is Malcolm Thompson,
of Captain Merrill's Company, 125th regi
meet. - Thompson left camp on Wednesday
evening, and came to the city. He remained
here until nearly noon, yesterday, (getting
quite intoxicated meanwhile) when he return
ed to camp. Aeoording to the report in
casop, he went to the quarters ef the 20th
Battery, where he had no business, and was
noisy and quarrelsome. He went to Captain
Smithnight's quarters, and was ordered away.
He refused to go away, and said he could
whip any man in the Battery. Orderly Ser
geant Fay, of the 20th Battery, took hold of
him and thrust him into the guard-house.
As Sergeant Fay was in the act of fastening
the door, Thompson fired his revolver, the
ball passing through the door and entering
Fay's breast in about the eenter just above
the stomaeh. Fay hardly knew that he was
hit for nearly a minute, when he plaeed his
hand on his breast, and said " I am shot !
A surgeon was 'summoned, who advised that
he be taken to his friends, as it was proba
ble that he was fatally hit. He was imme
diately eonveyed to the residence of his
sister, on Huron street. At five o'elock in
the afternoon he was alive, but his recovery
was considered hopeless.
Doctors Meyer and Schenck and other sur
geons are attending him. The ball has not
been found. Seme anppo that it is in his
lungs ; others that it has passed through his
lungs and is lodged in his back. He raises
blood constantly. Sergeant Fay is a single
man, about Zl years of age. He had formerly
practiced law in this city. He served three
years in the service in Germany.
Great excitement was created in camp
when the occurrence became known, espe
cially among Captain Smithnight's men.
There was a disposition to execute summary
vengeance on Thompson, by hanging or
shooting him, amd it became necessary to
post a strong guard around the guard-house
in which he was confined. Sheriff Craw was
sent for to remove the man to the County
Jail, for fear of his being lynched by the mad
dened soldiers. Sheriff Craw and Deputy
Sheriff Fraiee went to camp and brought
to jail about four o'clock r. M. The
soldiers did not interfere, although they ex-
ibited a strong inclination to do so. Tho
decision and coolness of Capt. Smithnight
and his officers, and the firmness of the Sher
iff and his Deputy had mnoh to do with pre
venting any serious outbreak.
Our reporter saw the prisoner, Malcolm
Thompson, in jail, last evening, and con
versed with him. His history, which he re
lated to oar reporter, is interesting. He is
twenty-three years of age, and was born in
Campbeltown, Argytshire, Highlands of Soot-
land, sixty miles from Glasgow, where both
is parents still reside. His father, Alexan
der Thompson, was for many years a sea cap
tain, but is now a road contractor. At nine
years of age Malcolm came to New Orleans,
on board his father's vessel, together with
is mother. Maleolm and his mother went to
Little Rock, Ark., and remained for some
time. She afterwards retained to Scotland,
but Malcolm has always called Little Rock
is home, although he has been away from
there a good deal. At twelve years of age
he went to sea, and has been a sailor eight
years of his life.
He was at little Rock when the rebellion
commenced and enlisted on the 25th of Feb
ruary, 1861, in a battery belonging to the 2d
Arkansas brigade. He was chosen Orderly
Sergeant of the battery. He served for twenty-two
months in the rebel army, during
which time he was in five important battles,
vii: Springfield, (where General Lyon was
lied,) Belmont, Fort Donelson, Pittsburg
Landing and Perry ville. In the retreat from
the field of the latter engagement he gave
himself up to Brigadier General Smith, in
command of a division of Kentucky troops.
He was takon to Louisville, where, after
taking the oath of allegiance, he was released.
He went to Cincinnati and there enlisted
in the 125th Ohio Volunteer Infantry. Ho
came here about two months ago.
With regard to the shooting of Fay, he
says he had no intention of shootiog him or
anybody else. He acknowledges firing
through the door, but says he didn't wish to
hit any one. If he had desired to shoot Fay,
he says he eould easily have done it before
being shut np in the guard-house. He ssys
he wa very much in liquor.
Thompson is a stout bnilt fellow with dark
hair and a most resolute and fearless eye.
He looks as If he might be dangerous when
interfered with in any way. He expresses
sorrow that the Sergeant is shot, and hopes
rill recover. He don't appear to be much
troubled by the occurrence, and speaks of It
as a piece of " carelessness " on his part.
He will probably be tried by military law,
whether the Sergeant lives o- :es.
We learn that a soldier u was in the
guard-house at the time Thompson fired the
shot, says that after the latter knew that he
had shot some one, he (Thompson) began to
re-load his revolver. We know not how true
it is.
Thx Lictuse. There was a good house
at Brainard's Hall last evening te listen to
Mr. Taeistro's lecture en the " Giants and
Pigmies of America." The lecture was a
polished and oft-times eloquent effort,deliver-
ed without notes, and was interesting, al
though mueh of it, pertaining to such men as
Clay, Webster, Jackson, Calhoun, Benton
and others, whom he placed in the category
of " Giants," was necessarily far from new.
He interspersed his notices of these men with
characteristic anecdotes of them, which gave
spice to the lecture. There was a degree ef
ostentation in the way in which the speaker
managed to introduce himself into all the
historic scenes and among all the " Giants"
whom he so graphically and eloquently de
scribed. It was pardonable, perhaps, for if
one has mingled with the great men of the
past it is hardly to be expected he will con
ceal the fact. The " Pigmies " of America
were not mentioned by name, and indeed
very little reference wis made to them. The
speaker rather left it to be inferred tbat the
"Giants" have all departed this life, and
that none but " Pigmies " occupy their places.
Fob thx 23d. Captain Hunter, of the
23d, (whose arrival in the city we noticed
some weeks since, when he brought an ounce
of secession home with him in the shape of a
ball in his leg,) leaves for his regiment to
morrow morning. Any letters left at Hower
A Higbee'a to-day will be taken by him. He
will be at Elyria Saturday and Sunday. Cap
tain Hunter is an old Crimean soldier.

The enemy deserted his fortifications
yesterday, destreying all the etocs they
could not carry with them.
The weather is bad, and the streams

night.
To-day pursuit was made to Oxford, and
coming on the rear guard of the enemy
skirmishing took place, lasting about two
hours, resulting in the capture of about

PLANTATION BITTLL.
Extract from a Letter oo the Eattle-FielJ.. 1
This battle (Antietam) has been the most
sanguinary of the war, and tha only ons
fought with visible design and open military
principles. The arrangement of our eorps
the overlooking position of the commanding
Gonoral the sending into action the right
and left divisions the olosing np of the een
ter, and final success excites bewildering
admiration, and carries the mind to the great
fields of Austerliti and Wagram, fought by
Napoleon. Of all this have I spoken. The
heart history of such a conflict, purchased by
the life of twenty thousand men, mast be
found in the hospitals. War has its glo
ries but it has ten thousand demons in
these human tortures, that make the eye
balls ache the heart bleed the lips palsy,
and the brain reel. The sight is at first pos
itively unendurable. The life blood of some
is still trickling away in silent calmness
while the dissevered limbs and maniae brain
of others give rise to sounds God grant I may
sot again witness.
But ye toothers who here seek a son or
wives a husband or sisters a brother or
sons a father know and be consoled that
even here the hand of mercy is watchful, and
better care is bestowed upon your loved ones
than might at first seem possible. ' It was In
the hospital, where rested the gallant Hooker,
that I learned the history of those my tiioal
words fa often seon and so little understood,
"S. T. 1360 X." Anything alleviating
the sufferings nd saving the lives of our
soldiers, is a natioaal blessing. I witnessed
tome astonishing results from this article.
It is well known the effect of burnt gun
powder and excitement is thirst, which ad
ded to the loss of blood in the wounded, cre
ates the necessity of a reviving stimulant.
In this particular hospipal, the physicians
were allowing their patients to drink Planta
tion Bitters, otherwise called S. T. 1860 X,
and although the aaoit numerous here this
division having opened he fight at five in the
morning the men were ostly composed
and there was Tery little fainSa,?. The arti
cle acts upon tho nerve is the wi incom
prehensible manner, supetiar to .brandy, ;and
without subsequent reaction. It origipated
in the West Indies, composed of h eele-
brated Calisaya Bark, Roe, Herbs, &.; all
preserved in gt. Croix Bum tho 8 T. 1860
X, being a secret ingredient nJT
revealed to the public." It i i principally rec
ommended for want of appetite, disordered
liver, intermittent fevers, stomachic difficul
ties, ko. I understand it was somewhat
known in the Southern States previous to the
war, and it appears as agent of Jefferson Da
vis recently applied to the proprietors for the
privilege to make it for hospital purposes du
ring the war, to which they made the following
reply : '
NEW YORK, Jan. 16th, 1862.
Agent of, &c.:
Dear Sir 'In reply to your communication
offering us " j'fty thousand dollars for the
recipe and right to make the Plantation Bit
ters for your hespita' purposes during the
war," we beg to say, yo?r price is a liberal
one, considering it would cot us nothing to
comply, and that otherwise we can derive no
revenue from the Southern States; but sir,
onr duties to our Government and our ideas
of consistency would not allow ns to entertain
it, although it may please us to assuage the
sufferings of your misguided followers.
We remain, ;
Very respectfully yours,
P.H. DRAKE & Co.
Tnese gentlemen give the history of certain
ingredient of their article for over two hun
dred years showing that through ail changes
of the medical profession and its practition
ers, strength, composure and cheerfulness
have been derived from these sonrces. Dr.
Woods in the Washington Hospitals informed
me that one patient was fast sinking and
crazy, and had not slept an hour for two
weeks, until the Plantation Bitters came to
his knowledge, when one day's trial gave
him a night's rest, and he was fast recover
ing. I am surprised our Government ho
not equalled Jefferson Davis in energy, and
adopted this invaluable article in all our
hospitals. The weak soldiers cling to it like
a brother. As a lay member, I can bear
witness it is " good to take," and affords
more energy aud life than anything I ever
tried. Success to the Plantation Bitters.
But I have digressed. In my next I shall
speak of gathering in the weundod, burying
the doad, te. NicoDiaca.
