Supt. Smith the lato comers wore very

By the way, Supt. Smith has adopted
an novel and effective plan of requiring
the attendance of the teachers at the
different sessions, for heretofore a
teacher might fail to attend several
sessious, and the directors of her school
would never bo any the wiser. Mr.
Smith provides each teacher with a
card, tilled out with her name and
address, and her attendance ut the
different sessions is noted by some
at the door punching a certain plhce
the card. At the close of the
sion these cards are delivered to the

THE SULTAN AND THE POWERS.
Still Tanipor
to Hold
tlona of tho
Constantinople, Dec. 2, via Sofia,
Bulgaria, Dec. 3.—As this dispatch is
sent, early Monday morning, thero are
further developments in the politi
cal situation here. During the day the
representatives of the Powers will hold
another meeting to determine what
stepB to take in view of the continued
refusal of the Sultan to grant the re
quest of tho Powers for extra guard
ships in the Bosphorus.
It is known that the Sultan, finding
that his appeals to the Powe
vain, has been making the strongest
personal appeals to the different sover
eigns interested, to induce them to
withdraw their demands for tho extra
guardsbips, pointing out, as usual,
that it would be a serious blow to his
dignity and that it might cause not
only the most serious rioting in Con
stantinople but an extended outbreak
upon the part of the Mussulmans gen
erally.
The work of strengthening the forti
fications of tho Dardanelles continues
night and day. The soldiers are busily
at work throwing up fresh defences and
the most busy scenes
from the entrance of tho Dardanelles
to the other side of Gallipoli. In ad
dition. the Bosphorus entrance of the
of Marmorn is being placed in
dition for defence. Many torpedoes
have been sunk in both passages and
this work is being pusbod with
astonishing vigor.
So far
absence of definite news, the most
serious disturbances threatened or in
progress is in Palestine, a fresh out
break being reported at Caesarea and
at Knoieh and in the Mecca districts.
It is reported hero this afternoon
that after the meeting of tho Ambas
sadors, Sir Philip Currie, the British
Ambassador, notified the Turkish gov
ernment that if tho firmans asked for
not granted by Saturday next, a
British gunboat would be sent through
tho straits of the Dardanellas, without
tho Sultan's permission, to act
extra guardship in the Bosphorus, for
the protection of tho British embassy.
Effort« to obtain confirmation or de
nial of the report have proved futile.

that movement would be re
ived by the Powers. Thus, a few days
floated to the effect
ago, a story
that Great Britain has proposed to dis
memberment of Turkey to Russia and
that the latter had refused to take part
in such a partitioning of the Ottoman
Empire. Soon after this story had been
digested, it was denied from a number
of sources.
Then it was reported that Russia,
after the Sultan bad made a direct ap
peal to the Czar, had consented to
waive her demands for an extra guard
ship in the Bosphorus, aod that this
of the causes of Great
Britain's withdrawing the Dryad from
tho entrance of the Dardanelles after
tho Sultan had refused to issue a per
mit fçr her to pass in.
Lastly, yesterday, after the meetirg
of tho ambassadors, it was rumored that
Sir Philip Currie, the British Ambas
sador, had notified the Porte that Great
Biitain gave the Sultan until Satur
day next in which to issue tho firmans
demanded, and that if they were not
forthcoming by that time
British guardship would pass the
straits without the Sultan's permission.
Tho Sultan has all along believed,
and the palace coterie has been appar
ently equally convinced, that Russia
would not act in accordance with Great
Britain, and that therefore Russia,
Franco and
counted upon, if it came to a decisive
crisis, to oppose any active interference
upon the part of Great Britain in the
Turkish Empire. In fact, this belief
was almost general in the
world, and
trary were received with polite smiles
of incredulity.
It became known to-day, however,
to the surprise of the skeptics, that
Russia is really in accord with tho
Powers, and that the Sultan need look
for no sympathy from the Czar or his
advisers in anything in any way tend
ing to thwart the determination of the
Powers to have order restored through
out the Turkish Empire, und measures
taken for the protecton of the lives and
property of all the Christian subjects
to the Sultan. This news has cast
a dismal spell over the Yildiz Kiosk,
and the ministers have been in almost
constant attendance upon the Sultan
over since.
The details of the developing of the
follows :
in threatened to
force the passage of the Dardanelles if
the firmans for the passing in of the
extra guardsbips were not granted, the
Sultan appealed personally to the gov
ernments of Russia, Austria, Germany
and Franco, begging them not to proas
their demands, calling their attention
to tho efforts nis government
ing to restore order and prevent further
outbreaks, and dwelling strongly upon
the danger of an uprising of the Mus
sulmans throughout tho empire if ho
*re subjected to such a Blight,
bold that tho mere fact of Bending tbo
additional warships to the Bosphorus
would be
not considered by the Pow
capable of mantaining order in his
dominions.
In no caso did the Sultan meet, with
success. Prince Lobanoff*Rostovsky,
the Russian Minister for Foreign Af

Some surprise is expressed at tho fact

LONDON PRESS ON TRE MESSAGE.
Referring to President Cleveland*«
message to Congress, tho St. James
Gazette this afternoon says:
"There is nothing whatever of the
jingo in Mr. Cleveland's message. In
spite of Hll assertions to the contrary,
thero is not the least probability that
tho United States will put any obstacle
in the way of a proper settlement i*
Venezuela. ''
The Pall Mall Gazette remarks: "So
our relations with America are
concerned, the message is not likely to
any unpleasant questions; but we
fail to see how Mr. Cleveland's defini
tion of Monroeism applies to Vencs
uela. ''
The Globe says : "There is nothing
the fact that the Monroe
surprising i
doctrine bulks rather largely in the
message nor in the hostile tone adopted
towards England. Is not tho presi
dential election drawing nigh? Pulling
tho lion's tail may look to tho old
