WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 6,1882.
The supreme court deoides that Lee's
heirs are entitled to the Arlington est
Ate.
The New York Commercial says it is
reported that Porter has sold all bis
Omaha holdings and thatVanderbilt has
bought them.
The friends of Oen. Terry are begin

tt SeDator Van Wyok, of Nebraska, says
there is no doubt whatever of tbe elec
tion of a republican senator to succeed
m'
*K
Saunders that most of the members
-1 eleoted to the legislature as anti-monop
olists are republicans.
A number of Chicago railroad mana
gers interviewed on the position of Pres
ident Porter of the Omaha line say the
question of territory belonging to the
.various roads and not to be built into by
others must be decided, are about evenly
divided, half agreeing and the other half
disagreeing with him.
Owing to land frauds of a startling
.- magnitude in connection with the Osage
Indian lands in Kansas, the commission
er of the general land office has issued an
order suspending all cash entries made
by sisglo men since June 23d, 1881,
where tho lands lie within the counties
of Sumner, Harper, King andComanohe.
A Cairo telegram of tbe 3d says Arabi
Pashn that morning pleaded guilty to
the chaige of rebellion. In the after
noon the court ^martial reassembled and
pronounced a sentenco of death. The
khedive commuted the sentence to exile
for life. It is believed Ar&bi will retire
to some part of the British dominions.
His demeanor before the court was very
dignified.
It is announced in Chicago that the
Illinois Central railroad will make a
freight rate of 15 oents per 100, regard
less of classification, lrom Chicago to
Omaha, to correspond with the rate from
Omaha to Chicago, unless the warring
roads in the northwest at once restore
rates between Chicago and Sioux City.
That they will do this is considered im
probable. The proposed cut by tbe Illi
nois Central would involve the Iowa pool
lines generally, it is believed.
The report of the tariff commission
says substantially that the reduction of
the tariff has been aimed at. The aver
age reduction of rates, including that
from the free lists and the abolition of
tho duties on charges and commissions,
is twenty to twenty-five per cent. The
reduotion in many cases has been forty
five to fifty per oent. If the reduction is
as large as the commission expected, and
if the opponents of the present economic
system say truly that the duty on manu
facture aud agricultural products en
hances prices to consumers on what is
imported, and also on domestic produc
tions, their reduction will benefit con
cumers to the extent of $100,000,000.
The physicians who attended the hile
President Garfield are not backward in
expressing their dissatisfaction at the
award of the board of audit. Dr. Bliss
said Sunday that he had not conferred
with his brethren who were assistants
with him in the case, and thereforo could
not say what their intentions were. For
himself he wanted it distinctly under
stood that he would not enter suit against
the estate for the balanee of his account,
nor would he go to congress for relief by
bill or otherwise, He would not under
take a law suit, as he had not the time
to devote to such business, and besides
he thought that he had done what was
proper and expected of him by present
ing his bill to the board of audit. He
would not undertake to say tbat the
other doctors would not petition congress
for redress, but such a measure would
not find favor with him.
Mrs. Coggins announces her annnal
display of millinery and fancy articles
for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of

their way from the "Art Loan" to call in

Mrs. C. has taken more care this year
than ever before in selecting her stock
of holiday presents, aiming to combine
usefulness, beauty and durability. They
need only to be seen to be appreciated.
