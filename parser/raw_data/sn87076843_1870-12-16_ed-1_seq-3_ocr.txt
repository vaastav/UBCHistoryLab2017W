Many of our exchanees are dolne their best
to tell beforehand what sort of a Winter we
ar to have. Severe weather was due from
the mi Idle nf November, and will also bo due
till the mid llo of Msrch. Now we have hnd a
whole month of mild weather, instead of a
month of suvere winter weather, which we had
reason to expect; contrqucnlly, upon the scien
tific and mathem itical principle nf 'average,'
we predict a mild' winter and high-priced ice
next Summer. The months of winter yet to
come would have to average considerably be
low i(ro to produce a severe wioter, and thev
will hardly bo to the trouble of doing this.see
ing that mild weather bas obtained one full
month the start.

Wki.lman gave our citizens a literary entertain

day evening last, in the M. E. CLurch.
The notice of the meeting was quite short, yet
a considerable audience were in attendance, and
regarded with much interest the readings 3t this
yuulhftilidy elocutionist.
In ju-itico to Miss Welluan, we would stale
that in point of gesture, distinct and clear pro
nunciation, and beautifully modulated emphasis
sha snrpassed our highest expectations, and we
have no doubt but she w ill, by the attainment of
further experience, attain the highest points of
excellency as a lady rhetorician.

Notice of Perrysburg hy an Illinois
r.ditor. We have recently received a visit
from John W. Bailsv, Esq., who is well known
in this county, )as a former proprietor of the Joi'R.
kal. Mr. Bailey removed to Princeton, Illi
nois, in 18f3, and, as proprietor of the Buresn
County ll'pMicmi, bas mot with great success.
As sn old resident of Perrysburg he regarded,
with much interest, the advance we have made
in commercial, and also in manufacturing enter
prise, snd expresses himself in bis widely cir
colated paper, the li-ullicaH, in tin) following
manner:
Arter "doing up" Tofede pretty thnrngklr
which city bv the way has grown to a popn'a
lion of over 32,000, aiid has completely doubled
its railroad and commercial enterprises during
the past ten years we.were accompanied to the
quiet little town of Perrysburg at the head of
navigation on the Muumoe liver, anme ten miles
south of Toledo, by N. II. Callard, where
we bad ths pleasure of renewing many old ac
quaintancea and forming new ones. Since the
writer left this section ofcuntry iu 1303, f errya
burg has assumed Borne importance aa a manu
facturing point, which perhaps is a sufficient
offset for losing the county seat. They haru
here at present two aaw mills, two planing mills,
two or three slave factories, paper mills, flour
mills, and a nuinberjof shops-giving employment
to a large number i f hands, and making local
trade lively. The stave factories alone give
iin;doynieut to over a honored workmen, an 1
turn out about two and half million ataves, w ith
the necessary headings for barrels, per annum.
They slso work a considerable quantity of the
materials up iuto barreli for the home Irado.

our privilege to sre the Doctor and to have an
intereating confab over old times, politics snd
the new order nf aB'iirs during the past few
years. The Doctor enjoys his honors with be
coming dignity, snd will make a useful member
of congress. We also dropped in at the I'eirys

The New Commissioner. We learn
that the newly elected County Commissioner, B
W. Kst.LiT, Esq , qualified on the 6th Inst., and
entered npon the duties bf his office. It Is well
ki own to all of nor fellow citiiens thst the
duties of ths Commissioners sre more Arduous
than those of any other looal office. Tbeeaa
of publio improvements, inch as ditches, roads,
snd of buildings, depend. Tory much en their
good judgement snd btmlntss capacity, while
their cost lo the lax-iayort may bs largely dl
mintahed by ths adoption of a just system of
contracts fur the execution of such works,
It is nndeniabls that ths past action of ths
Commissioners 'n these, matters has boen, in
many instances, indiscriminate and ill Judged,
so that public works whioli, In this eounlr,are
In general very costly, hare bicemo oppress
ively burdonaome Rod uijust to parties Inter
ested.
Previons to his nomination wc cordially en
dorsed Mr. Ksi.Lir, from the faot that his high
character and business capacity well fitted hiiri
lo discharge the dutios of Commissioner to the
satisfaction nf the tax-payers at large. In as
turning the duties of his office we heartily trust
that, in association with his colleagues, snob ju
dicious measures will be adoptei as may ad
vance the credit of Wood county, so that its or
ders may be no longer nt the disgracsfully ruin
ous dsicnunt which has hitherto governed them.
By proper management tho credit of Wood
county, and Its prosperity may be made to com
pare favorably with the beat counties in the
State.
Mr. Kkllkt has our best wishes, and will re
ceive our hearty concurrence iu evory effort to
promote. the public good.
Report of Internal Itevcnne. We are
under obligatiuns to acting Commissioner Uora
LA8 fur R copy of Commissioner Dsi.ano's Re
port.
The statement made by it Is highly creditable
to Mr. Drlamo and his subordinate officers. U
exhibits, in the clearest manner, the importance of
having honest and competent officers in the pub
lic service, which is obtained by the following
statement :
The gross receipts from sll sources of the in
ternal revenue fur the first eighteen months of
the present administration, compared with those
of the last eighteen mnotlis of llw late adminis
tration, are increased to the amount of 019,172,-
Gfil 09, and taking the same sources uf revenue,
the excess dnriag the same period of compari
son in favor of the present administration
amounts to the very large sum of $101,8,13 077 1.1.
Official acts lik.c thesejspeak to the people in
buhalf of the Republican party iu tones of pleas
ing eloquence. Let ;tho game line of policy be
adopted by the other branches of the public ser
vice, and the party in puwer will exhibit a ca
pacity for progressive reform which bai hut few
parallels, and which will place it' in pleasing
contrast with its predecessor in out cial power.

ist more in name than in rearit. They arc not
alone applicable to Omaha :
Uaat ever boen to Omaha,
Where rolls the dark Missouri down (
Add four strong horses scarce can draw
An empty wagon through lbs town T
Where every bubble, late or soon,
- From frotliy substanno overflowing,
Is mads a very large balloon,
By constant snd persistent blowing t
Where muddy waters rlae and swell,
With fearful and rasiatloss might
Where fish are caught by sense of smell,
Becsuse they cannot ace to bitoT
Where sand is blown from every mound,
To fill ynnr eyes, snd ears, and throat
Where all the steamers are aground,
And all the shanties are afloat T
Where taverns hays an anxious gsiest
For every corner, shelf snd crack,
With half ths people going west,
And all the others going back T
Where whisky shops, the livelong night,
Are vending out their poison luicei
Where men are prettv often tight,
And women deemed a trifle loose T
Where 'beats' and 'blacklegs,' thick ai bail,
Are neep in iam, oarna anu vioea
Where real estate is still fur sale.
And hold at most outrageous prices ?
Where theaters are all the run.
And bloody scalpers come, to trade j
Where everything is overdone,
And everybody underpaid t
If not,' lake heed In whnt t sari .
You'll find it just as I bare' found It
And if it lies npon your way,
