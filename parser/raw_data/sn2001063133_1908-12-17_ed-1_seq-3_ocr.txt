REPORT ON BANKS MADE
Comptroller L. O. Murray Submits
His Figures and Statistics
to Congress.
•HOWS THE AMOUNTS HELD.
Resources of Institutions
at Last
Accounts $9,027,280,484, Hav­
ing Doubled Since 1900.
The bunking power of the United
States to-day is shown to be $17,042,
705.274 in tho annual report of Law
rence O. Murray. Comptroller of the
Currency. This is an amount exceeding
tho world's banking power in 1S90.
There
:!re
25,000 banks and banking in-
slituiions in the United States. The
Comptroller plat.rs the world's banking
power l.o-day at $2S,
107,000.000. This
places the aggregate banking power of
the world at $45.750. j00,000.
The report deals almost exclusively
with figures. Mr. Murray has this to
say on failures and the cause:
Of the thirty-throe national hanks for
Xvhicli receivers wore appointed during tho
year ended Oct. .'!!. P.iiVS, nine banks,
wiili abrogate capital of $
1.290.000. were
restored to solvency and authorized to
resume business, while receivers proceeded
to liquidate the assets of twenty-four
banks found to be irretrievably insolvent.
The nominal value of assets taken charge
of by the receivers of these twenty-four
banks was $511,415,511. the liabilities, so
far as reported, being $10,342.(510. Divi
dends to the amount of $7,994,000 have
been paid to creditors of the banks which
failed during the year, and the affairs of
one such bank having been filially settled
the receivership was terminated.
".Voting the cause of failure of banks
in charge of receivers during tho year, it
appears that seven banks were wrecked
by the cashier, one by defalcation of offi
cers and three chiefly through fraudulent
management, among other causes. Of the
•remainder, four failed from excessive,
loans to otljers and depreciation of securi
ties, etc.. three by reason of injudicious
banking, two from excessive loans to di
rectors and others and two from deprecia
tion of securities, one from failure of
large debtors and one from general strin
gency in the money market.
The Comptroller estimates the num
ber of depositors in national banks at
f.25O.(i0o. Here are figures showing
bank earnings:
Consolidating the reports of earnings
(ind dividends for the year ended July 1,
19(lS. in an average capital and surplus
-'of SSSBUKK.OH) and $5 tS.N50.47G, respec
tively. the gross earnings are shown to be
t5 :2.454.002: losses, etc., charged off,
..•.p50.5fiK.205, and expenses and taxes paid,
150,551.010, leaving net earnings of
Si:"l.:!.1.2SS. The aggregate amount of
dividends paid during the periods was
f07,: J,2S2, an average of 10.S0 per cent.
Continuing, tho report says
On or about June 30. 190S, the banks
-f the country had on hand $1,308,329,
-SSft. against $1,113,7-12.310 in 1907, a gain
of S254.5S7.3G7 during the year. About
two-thirds of the cash holdings of the
banks of the country is in national banks.
Bank resources have more than doubled
since 1900, but during the current year
there has been a decrease of about one
third of 1 per cent.

WORK OF
CONGRESS
After listening to the reading of the
president's message the miscellaneous
work of the Senate Tuesday consisted
in the main of the reference jn execu
tive session of about .1,500 recess nomi
nations. which were sent in by tho
President, and the adoption of resolu
tions of regret on account of the death
$f members of the House who have
passed away since the adjournment last
May. The reading of the President's
annual message was the chief business
of the session, but a number of bills
were sent to conference, among them
being one providing for a new immigra
tion station in Boston. In addition, the
speaker announced the appointment of
Mr. lliggins, of Connecticut, to a place
on the committee on judiciary in place
of Mr. I.ittletield. and of Mr. Martin
to a place on the committee on Indian
affairs in place of Mr. Parker, de
ceased. For the first time during the
present Congress there was a call of
the committees of tho House, but no
measure was reported by any of them.
The Senate session Wednesday was
devoted chiefly to the formal presenta
tion of departmental reports and the
introduction of bills. The reports have
been made public from time to time
and the bills, numbering 3."i2, were
chiefly for the granting of pensions.
Senator Johnston, of Alabama, intro
duced a bill to reinstate former Cadets
Russell and Weaver, dismissed from
the military academy for hazing. He
declared that their punishment was
excessive and said that every new Sen
ator was hazed by being given unim
portant assignments and being restrict
ed in his privileges. For nearly live
house the House considered the bill
providing for flic taking of the thir
teenth-and subsequent decennial cen
suses. and passed it without material
change. Prolonged, animated and. at
times, heated discussion was precipi
tated over an amendment' by Mr. Gil
lett. of Massachusetts, who sought to
have tho temporary census force au
thorized by the bill with the excep
tion of a few minor positions, appoint
ed upon the basis of compt'd itive instead
of non-competitive examinations.
The Senate held a short session
Thursday, during which an agreement
was readied for taking up the omnibus
claims bill Monday with tin* under
standing that it shall not interfere with
the consideration of the postal savings
bill or any other measure in which
senators are especially interested. Aft
er a short executive session the Senate
adjourned until Monday in respect to
the, memory of the late Representative
Charles T. Dunwell, of Now Vorlc. At
no time was there a quorum in the
House. The legislative appropriation
bill was presented and several bills
passed, among them being OIK author
izing the removal of the imposition of
loss of citizenship upon deserters in the
military and naval services. The rest
of the day was taken up in discussing
the bill to provide for the arbitrary in
vestigation of dilliculties between em
ployers and employes.
The Senate was not in session Fri
day. In the House the legislative, ex
ecutive and judicial appropriation bill,
which usually excites considerable dis
cussion, lasting for several days, was
passed with little debate and practi
cally in the shape in which it came
from committee. An unusual feature
was that no member asked for time to
indulge in general talk. The bill car
ries an appropriation of 531,005.320.
The House, immediately after conven
ing. unanimously and without debate
adopted a resolution providing for the
appointment of a committee of five to
consider the reference to the secret
service in the President's message, and
to suggest what action, If any, should
be taken in the matter.
Tho Senate was not in session Satur
day. No particular program had been
mapped out, but under a call of com
mittees several measures in which the
members were especially interested
were considered. With few exceptions
they engendered the liveliest sort of de
bate. Parliamentary tactics were free
ly resorted to, with the result that five
times the roll was called. The first
wrangle occurred on a resolution fixing
the boundary line between the States
of Colorado, Oklahoma and New Mex
ico, which was adopted by a good ma
jority, but not without two roll calls.
The House then by a decisive vote re
fused further to consider the bill pro
viding for arbitrary settlement of dis
putes between employers and employes.
Next the bill providing for the protec
tion of aliens in the United States was
thrashed out at length. The measure
had rough sailing, and it was passed
by a slim majority after the roll had
been called twice.

Prof. Kenneley of Harvard says that
the importance attached to winning a
race and beating a concrete competitor is
old-fashioned and savors of the "ante
chronometer" days, and that the imper
sonal scientific age demands a different
attitude in athletics, lie says that the
only attempt worth while nowadays is
to have a try against the record.
The Cornell educational special is the
first farm train to be sent out by the
New York State College of Agriculture.
Forty-five minute stops were made at
the smaller stations, and- the subjects
chosen for the lectures were those adapt
ed to the products raised in the territory
covered. In the larger towns and cities
the boards of trade hired halls for the
ipeakers, and many people attended the
lectures. Schools were given a holiday to
enable students to attend.
In discussing the subject of refractory
children at the Congress of Neurologists
in session recently at Ghent, Belgium, it
was generally admitted by physicians pres
ent that the refractory can not be cured
by repressive measures. *"It is quite
possible," said one, "to punish a child
into jail." It was agreed that most un
manageable Children suffer from some
nervous disease and should be treated as
sick rather than as merely refractory.
Great stress was laid on the necessity of
developing the psychic faculties.

Census Inquiry Shows Railways
Are Large Holders of Carrier
Stocks.
FIX RATES BY AGREEMENTS.
Bix Leading Companies Dominate la
the Package Transportation
Business.
An investigation of the express busi
ness ol the United States lias just been
completed by the census buroau of the
government, which covers all phases of
that business and shows in detail the
relations of the express companies with
the railroads of the country. It is
Stow 11, for Instance, that the railroads
of the country own more than ono
fourtli of the stock of the express com
panies and that. In turn, the express
companies own railroad slock to the
imoimt of more than $22,000,000, which
Is also it figure in excess of one-fourth
of their own capitalization. The con
tracts between the companies and the
railroads are set forth ns well as the
method of .determining the rates.
In 1907 there wore thirty-four ex
press companies as compared with eigh
teen In .1890. Only ton of tho companies
reporting in 1890 were in existence un
der the same name in 1907 the remain
ing eight companies have gone out of
business, have been absorbed by other
companies or are operating under other
names. The total express mileage baa
Increased from 174.059 miles to 235,903
miles, a gain of 115.5 per cent.
Com panic* tluit Dominate.
In 1907 as in 1890 the express busi
ness was dominated by the following
companies: Adams, American, Pacific,
Southern, United States, and Wells,
Fargo & Co. The last-mentioned leads
in the amount of mileage operated, with
the American Express Company a close
second. These six leading companies
operated 92.7 per cent of the total mile
age in 1S00 and S7.5 per cent in 1907.
I11 the number of miles covered by
express companies Tcxns ranks first
among the Slates and territories, fol
lowed, in the order named, by Illinois,
Iowa. Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York
and Kansas. The use of steamboat
lines is most extensive iu Alaska,
where water routes furnish practically
the only facilities for transportation. Iu
Maine, New York, Washington and
Michigan the steamboat mileage is also
large. Electric roads are used by tho
express companies in only twenty
States. Seventy-two per cent of the
total mileage by electric roads is in
Ohio, New York and California. In
only fifteen States are stage lines still
used by express companies, and S8.7
per cent of the mileage of such lines
Is in the Western States, principally
California and Nevada.
Rccelpl.s 1111 (I ICx pcmlII urcfi.
The total receipts of till the express
companies amount to $128,117,170, of
which 97 per cent is receipts from op
eration and 8 per cent receipts from
other sources. Over 90 per cent of the
total receipts represents the receipts
of tho six leading companies. Two im
portant items of expense in the express
business are tlia amounts paid to steam
roads and the salaries and wages,
which In 1907 wore $50,37S,349 and
$ 19,531,754, respectively, and together
constituted, as in 1890, over SO per cent

BIG APPLE CR0P~
Iliis Year's Growing Estimated te
Be About 25,000,000 Barrels
If the apple harvest In the commer
cial orchards of the United States this
year were converted into pies the army
af bakers needed to do the work would
turn out li.250,000,000 of them, and
these placed side by side would make
a path of almost 975.000 miles.
The tfrtal weight of this mountain of
pastry is estimated at 9,210,000 pounds,
including 0,125,000,000 pounds of flour,
lard and other ingredients used In the
popular American after-dinner dessert,
and would require 154,100 cars of
standard capacity to transport them
from the ovens to tho consumers.
Twenty-five million barrels, ot^ 02,
1500,000 bushels, is the estimated yield
this season, according to reports receiv
ed by Harry J. Neely, secretary of the
national apple show at Spokane, from
15,000 growers, operating the varIou»
belts in the Union.
Tho returns show that while
droughts, excessive rains, or pests
wrought havoc In many districts in the
middle western, eastern and several
southern States, the entire crop is fully
as largo as in 1907 and it Is better dis
tributed. Prices also are higher than
last year. However, the domestic sup
ply is smaller than at any time since
1895, for the reason that U10 demand of
the export trade is heavier and in
treaslng yearly.
Bad Emotion* Poiftonoax.
Dr. Landone, who plans to improve the
human race by Biirbank's plant theories
Jn the rearing of children, in a recent
interview dwelt on the value of cultiva
ting love and cheerfulness and good
thoughts toward mankind. "For," he
gaid, "the body is a substance composed
of chemicals and these chemicals are at
the mercy of the emotions. Anger, hatred
and sorrow poison the fluids of the body,
while love, cheerfulness and happiness
serve as eliminators of emotive and ffr
tlgue poisons.

What was accomplished toward the
construction of the big ditch across the
American isthmus during the last fiscal
year is told with much detail in the re
port of the Canal Commission. It
shows that the total cost of the canal
to date, Including the $29,000,000 appro
priated for the year 1909, is $120,•
864,-ICS. With an average of 43,057
workers on the pay roll, the death rate
per thousand was 1S.:!2, less than half
«f the previous year. The decrease
was especially among the blacks, and
this testifies to improved sanitation.
During the year 929 palienls in the ho#»
pitals aied out of 27,52:5 treated. Ma«

The annual report of Postmastei
General Meyer discloses a deficit of
110.910,27s, the largest, in the history
ol the department, the increase in rove- s:
nue having been only half the ordinary
rate of recent: years. The chief cause
of the deficit: is the large Increase of
the rural free delivery system, which
cost $34,:!Cl,4ti Th Postmaster Gen-::
eral recommends now a parcel post ad
dition to the rural delivery, believing
that it would be not only of great ben
efit to the farmers, but would earn mill
ions for the postal service. Further
more, it is urged that such a servic#
would help the small local stores.
