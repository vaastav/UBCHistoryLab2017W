c#
of certaf& Airoducts snd the right of inde
pendent nations to make special reciprocal
trade concessions Is well established, and
dops not Impair either the comity duo to
other powers er what Is known as the "fa
vored nation" claaae so generally found In
cdmmerclal treaties, and whot is given to
one for an adequate consideration cannot
be claimed by another freely. The state
of the revenues was such that we could
dispose with any import-duties upon coffee,
tea, hides, and the lower grades of sugar
and molasses, and that the large advantage
resulting to the countries producing and
exporting these articles, by placing them on
the frge list, entitled us to expect a fair
returri in a way of customs, concessions
upon articles ..exported by us to them, was
so obvious that to have gratuitously aban
doned this opportunity to enlarge our trade
wouldJmve been an unpardonable error.
Thet^Bo but two methods of niaintain
lnj^^^^B^)f this questiou, open to con
IwVK'l'va" these articles upon
ttie TKw"al® list subject to such treaty
agreemWotsp® could be secured, or to place
them allVPreseutly upon the free list but
subject to the reimposition of specified du
ties of the countries from which we received
them should they refuse to give to us suita
ble reciprocal benefits. This latter method,
I think, possesses great advantages. It
expresses in advance the conseut of con
gress to reciprocity arrangements affecting
these products, which must otherwise have
been delayed and unascertained until each
treaty was ratified by the senate and the
necessary legislation enacted by congress.
Experience has shown that some treaties
looking to reciprocal trade have failed to
secure a two-thirds' vote In the senate for
ratification, and others having passed
that stage have for years awaited
the concurrence «f the house
nnd senate in such modifications of our
revenilalaws as were necessary to give cf•
feet tojTJjelr provisions. We now have the
conwtence of both houses in advance in a
'jt and definite offer of free entry to
tfiij^Bts of specific articles, The exccu
tlvJ^^not required to deal in conjecture as
to wraat congress wiil accept. Indeed, this
reciprocity provision is more than :in offer.
Our part of the bargain is complete. De
livery has been made, and when iho coun
tries from which we receive sugar, coffee,
tea. and have placed on their free lists such
of our products as shall be agreed upon as
an equivalent for our coucession. a proc
lamation of that fact completes the trans
action. And In the meantime our own peo
ple have free sugar, tea. coffce aud hides.
The indications thus far given are very
hopeful of early aud favorable nctiou by
the countries from which we receivo our
large imports of coffee and sugar, and it is
confidently believed that if steam com
munication with these countries can be
Piamptly Improved and enlarged the next
yc&r will show a most gratifying increase
in our exports of breadstuff's and provis
ions. as well as of some important lines of
manufactured goods.
A GENTLE REMINDER.
Bills of High Importance Which Should
B« Passed at an Early Date.
In addition to the bills that became a law
'before adjournment of the last session some
lier bills of the highest importance were
1 advanced toward a final vote and now
iipon the calendar of the two houses
W'" "m^^ored positions. The present session
W Sisa fixed limit, apd If theso measures are
^iot now brought to a final vote, all the ivorlc
that has been dono upou them by this con
gress is lost. The proper consideration of
an apportionment bill nud of the
annual appropriation bills will require not
only that no working day of the sessiou
shall be lost but that measures of minor and
local interest shall not be allowed to inter
rupt or retard the progress of those that
are of universal interest. In view of these
conditions I refrain trom bringing before
you at this time so mo suggestions that
would otherwise be made, and most ear
nestly invoke your attention to the duty of
perfecting the Important legislation new
well advanced. To some ot these measures
which seem to me most important 1
now
freely call your attention. 1 desire to re
peat with added ucgency the recommenda
tion contained hi my last annual message
In relation to the development of
American steamship.Hues. The reciprocity
clause of the tariff bill will be largely lim
ited, and its benefits retarded and dimin
ished if provision is not contemporaneously
made to encourage the establishment of
first-class steam communication between
our pofts and the ports of such nations as
may meet our overt*res for enlarged com
mercial exchanges. The steamship, carry
ing the mails steadily and frequently, and
offering to passengers a comfortable, safe
and speedy transit is the first condition of
iorelgn trade. It carries the order of the
Vuyer, but not all that is ordered or
""•ought. It gives to the sailing vessels
jch cargoes us are not urgent or perish
able, and. Indirectly at least, promotes that
Important adjunct of commerce. There is
now both In this country nnd in the nations
of Central and South America a state of ex
pectation and confidence as to the in
creased trade that will give a double value
to your prompt action upon this question.
The present situation of oui1 a,ail communi
cation with Australia illustrates the im
portance of early action by congress. The
Oceanic Steamship company main
tains a line of steamers between
San Francisco, Sydney, aud Auckland,
consisting of three vessels, two
of which ai« «f United States registry and
one of foreign registry. For the service
done by this line in carrying the mails we
pay annually the sum of 846.000, being, as
estimated, the full sea and United States
inland postage, which Is the limit fixed by
law. The colonies ot New South Wales and
New Zealand have been paying annually
to these lines £37,000 for carriug the mails
from Sidney and Auckland to San Frau
cisco. The contract under which this pay
ment has been made Is now about to expire,
and these colonies have refused to renew
the contracts unless the United Statos shall
pay a more equitable proportion of the
whole sum necessary to maintain the ser
vice. I am advised by the postmaster gen
eral that the United Suites receives for
carrying the Australian mails brought to
San Francisc* in those steamers by rail to
Vancouver an estimated annual income of
975,000, while, as I have stated, we are pay
ing out for the support of the steamship
line that brings this mall tons only 840,000,
leaving an annual surplus, resulting from
this service, of 969,009. The trade of the
United States with Australia, which is in a
considerable part carried by these
steamers, the whole of which'
Is practically dependent upon the mail
communication which they maintain, is
largely in our favor. Our total exports of
merchandise to Australian ports during the
fiscal year ending June 30,1890, were $11,
206,484, while the total imports of merchan
dise from these ports were only 84,277,676.
If we are not willing to see this important
steamship line withdrawn, or continued
with Vancouver substituted for San Fran
cisco as the American terminal, congress
should put it in the power of the postmas
ter-general to make a liberal increase in
the amount now paid for the transportation
of this important mall. The south Atlantic
and gulf ports occupy a very favored posi
tion towards the new and important com
merce which the reciprocity clause of the
tariff act and.Ae postal shipping bill are
designed to promote. Steamship lines from
these ports to some northern port of South
America will almost certainly effect a con
nection between the railroad systems of the
continents long before any continuous line
of railroads can be put into operation. The
very large appropriation made at the last
session for the harbor of Galveston
was justified, as It seemed to me,
by- these .. considerations. Th© great
northwest will feel the advantage of trunk
lines to the sonth as well as to the east and
of the new markets opened for the supply
of food products and for many of their man
ufactured products.
I had oooasion in my last message to
transmit to congress a report adopted by
the international American conference up
on the gublect of the incorporation of an
J* «»V
&
Ci
.' .^* f, .••'"* i,
{if-!
I
The bill fortha relief of the supreme
court has, After many years of discussion,
reached a position where final action Is at
tainable, and it la hoped that any differ
ences of optnlon be to harmonized as to save
the essential features of this important
measure, la this coanectlou I earnestly
renew my recommendation that the salaries
of the judges of the United States district
courts be so readjusted that none ol them
shall receive less than 15.000 per annum.
The subject ot the unadjusted Spanish and
American land grants and the urgent ne
cessity for providing some commission for
tribunal for the trial of questions which
grow out of them were twice brought by
me to the attention of congress at the last
session. Bills have been reported from the
proper committees in both houses upon the
subject, aud I very earnestly hope that this
congress will put an end to the delay which
has attended the settlement of the disputes
as to titles between settlers and their claim
ants under these grants. These disputes
retard the prosperity and disturb the peace
of large and important communities.
The governor of New Mexico in bis last
report to the secretary ot the interior, sug
gests some modifications of the provisions
of the pending bills relating to the small
holdings of farm lands. I commend to your
attention the suggestions of the secretary
of the Interior upon this subject.
The enactment ot a national bankrupt
law still regard as very desirable. The
constitution having given to congress juris
diction of this subject, it should be exer
cised and uniform rules provided for the
administration of the affairs of insolvent
debtors. The inconveniences resulting from
the occasional and temporary exercise of
this power by congress and from the con
flicting state codcs of insolvency which
come into force intermediately, should be
removed by the enactment of a simple, in
expensive and permanent national bank
rupt law.
1 also renew my recommendation in favor
of legislation affording just Copyright pro
tection to foreign authors on a footing of
reciprocal advantages for our authors
abroad.
It may still be possible for this congress
to inaugurate by suitable legislation a
movement looking to uniformity and in
creased safety in the use of couplers and
brakes upon freight trains engaged in inter
state commerce. The chief difficulty in the
way is to secure agreement as to the host
appliances, simplicity, effectiveness and
cost being considered This difficulty will
only yield to legislation, which should be
based upon full inquiry and impartial tests.
The purpose should be to secure the co
operation of all well-disposed managers
and owners, but the fearful fact that every
year's delay involves the sacrifice of 2,000
lives and the maiming of 20,000,young men
should plead both with congress and man
agers against any needless delay.
The subject of the conservation and equal
distribution of the water supply of the arid
regions has had much attention from con
gress. but has not as yet been put upon a
permanent and satisfactory basis. The
urgency of the subject does not grow out ot
any large present demand for the use ot
these lands for agriculture, but out of the
danger that the water supply and the sites
for the necessary catch basins may fall
into the hands of individuals or private
corporations and be used to render subser
vient the largo areas dependent upon such
supply. The owner of the water Is the
owner of the lands, however the titles may
run. AH unappropriated natural water
sources and all necessary reservoir sites
should be held by the government for the
equal use, at fair rates, of the homestead
settlers who will eventually take up these
lands. The United States should not. in my
opinion, undertake tho construction ot dams
or canals, but should limit its work to such
surveys and observations as nill determine
the water supply, both surface and subter
ranean, the areas capable ot irrigation, and
the use and location ot the storage capacity
of reservoirs. This done, the use ot the
water and ot the reservoir sites might be
granted to the respective states or terri
tories, or to individuals or associations
upon the condition that the necessary works
should be constructed and tho water fur
nished at fair rp.tes, withoutdiscrimlnatlon,
the rates to be subject to supervision by
legislatures or by boards of water commis
sioners duly constituted. The essential
thing to be secured is the common and
equal use at fair rates of the accummu
la-ted water supply. It wero almost better,
that these lands should remain arid than
that those who occupy them should become
the slaves of unrestrained monopolies con
trolling the one essential element of land
values and crop results.
The use. of the telegraph by the postofflce
department as a means for the rapid trans
mission of written communications is, I be
lieve, upon proper terms, quite desirable.
Tho government does qot own or operate
the railroads, and it should not, I think,
own or operate the telegraph lines. It does,
however, seem to be quite practicable for
tho government to contract with the tele
graph companies, as it does with the rail
road companies, to carry at specified rates
snch communications as the senders may
designate for this method of transmission.
I recommend that such legislation be en
acted as will enable the postofflce depart
ment fairly to test by experiment the ad
vantages of such a use of the telegraph.
It any intelligent and loyal company of
American citizens were required to cata
logue the essential human conditions ot na
tional life, I do not doubt that with abso
lute unanimity they would begin with
•'Free and Honest Elections." And it is
gratifying to know that generally there Is
a growing and non-partisan demand for
better election laws. But against this sign
of hope and progress must be set the de
pressing and undeniable fact that Election
laws and methods are sometimes cunningly
contrived to secure minority control, while
violence completes the shortcomings of
fraud. In my last annual message I
suggested that the development of
the existing law providing a
federal supervision of congressional elec
tions offered an effective method of reform
ing these abuses. The need of such a law
has manifested itself in many parts of the
country and its wholesome restraints and
penalties will be useful in all. The consti
tutionality of such legislation has been af
firmed by the supreme court. Its probable
effectiveness is evidenced by the character
of the opposition that is made to it. It has
been denounced as if it were a new exercise
of federal power and an Invasion of the
rights of the states. Nothing could be
further from the truth. Congress has al
ready fixed the time for the election of
members of congress. It has declared that
votes for members of congress must be by
written or printed ballot. It has provided
for the appointment by the circuit courts in
certain cases, and upon the petition of a
certain number of citizens, of election
supervisors, and made it their duty to
supervise the registration of voters con
ducted by the state officers to challenge
personS offering to register to personally
inspect and scrutinize the registry lists, and
to affix their names to the lists for the pur
pose of identification and the prevention of
frauds to attend at elections and remain
with
the boxes until the votes are all oast
and counted to attach to the registry lists
and election returns any statement touch­

International American bank with a view to
the facilitation of mouey exchanges be
tween the states represented in thatconfer
ence. Such an institution would greatly pro
mote the trade we are seeking to develop.
I renew the recommendation that a careful
and welt-guarded charter bo given. I do
not think the powers granted should include
those ordinarily exercised by a trust guar
anty aud satu deposit company, or that
more branches in the United States should
be authorized than are strictly necessary to
accomplish the object primarily In view,
namely, convenient foreigu exchanges. It
is quite important that prompt action should
be taken in this matter, in order that any
appropriations for better communication
with those countries and any agreements
that may be made for reciprocal trade may
not be hindered by the Incouvenlence ot
making exchanges through European
money centers or burdened by the tribunal
which Is an accident ot that method ot
business.
I
ing the accuracy and fairness of the regis
try and elections and to take and transmit to
the house of representatives any evidence
of fraudulent practices which may be pre
sented to them. The same law provides for
the appointment of deputy United States
marshals to attend art the polls, support the
supervisors in the discharge of their duties,
and to arrest persons violating the election
laws. Tho provisions of thts familiar title
of the revised statutes have been put into
exercise by both the great political parties,
and in tho north as well as In tho south by
filing with the court the petitions re
quired by.law. It Is not, therefore, a ques
tion whether we shall have a federal elec
tion law, for we now have one, and have
had for nearly twenty years, but whether
we shall have an effective law. The pres
ent law stops just short o( effectiveness, for
it surrenders to the local authorities all
control over the certification which estab
lishes the prima facie right to a seat in the
house ot representatives. This defect
should be cured. Equality of representa
tion and the purity of the elections must be
maintained, or everything that Is valuable
In our system of government ts lost. The
qualifications of an elector must be sought
in the law, not in the opinions, prejudices,
or fears ot any class, however powerful.
The path of the elector to the ballot box
must be free from the ambush of fear and
the enticements of fraud the count so true
and open that none shall galAsay it. Such
a law should be absolutely non-partisan
and Impartial. It should give the advan
tage to honesty and the control to majori
ties. Surely there Is nothing sectional
about this creed, and if ft should happon
that the penalties of laws Intended to en
force tlmso rights fall here and there, it is
not because the law Is sectional, but be
cause, happily, crime is local and not uni
versal. Nor should It be forgotten that
every law, whether relating to elections or
to any other subject, whether created bya
the state or by tho nation, has force behind-'
it. The courts, the marshal or constable,
the
posse comitatus.
The prisons are all and
always behind the law. One can not be
Justly Charged with unfriendliness to any
section or cause who seeks only to restrain
violations of law and of personal right. The
community will find lawlessness unprofit
able. No community can afford to have
it known that tho officers who
are charged with the preservation of the
public peace and the restraint of the crimi
nal classes are themselves the product of
fraud or violence. The magistrate is then
without respect agd the law without sanc
tion. The floods of lawlessness cannot bo
believed and made to run in one channel.
The killing of a United States marshal car
rying a writ of arrest for an election of
fense is full of prompting and suggestion to
men who are pursued by a city marshal for
a crime against life or property. But It is
said that this legislation will revive race
animosities, and some have even sug-?
gested that when the peaceful methods of
fraud are made impossible they may be
supplanted by intimidation and violence.
If the proposed law gives to any qualified
eltCtdf by a hair's weighs more than this
renewal, Influence, or detards by so much
from any other qualified elector, it is fatally
impeached. But if the law is equal
and the animosities it is to avert
grow out of the fact that some
electors have been accustomed to
exercise that franchise for others as well as
for themselves, then these animosities
ought not to be confessed without shame,
and ennnot be given any welsht in the dis
cussion without dishonor. No choice is loft
to me but to enforce with vigor all laws in
tended to secure to the citizen bis consti
tutional rights, and to recommend that the
inadequaties of such laws be promptly
remedied. If the promotion, with zearl and
ready Jnterest, of every project for tho de
velopment of its material interests, its
rivers, -harbors, mines aud factories, and
the intelligence, peace and security under
the l^pr.of its communities and Its homes, is
not accepted as sufficient evidence of
friendliness to any state or section, I can
not add connivance at election practices
that not only disturb local results, but rob
the electors ot other states and sections of
their most priceless political rights.
The preparation of the general appropria
tion bills
should be
conducted with thegreat
est'care and the closest scrutiny. The expen
ditures and appropriations should be ade
quate to the needs of the public service, but
they should be absolutely free from prodi
gality.
venture again to remind you that the
brief time remaining for the consideration
of the important legislation now awaiting
upon attention offers no margin for waste,
it the present duty is discharged with dili
gence, fidelity and courage, tbe work of the
Fifty-first congress may be confidently sub
mitted to the considerate judgment of the
people.

OF SOUTH DAKOTA ADOPTS
E S O I O N S
The System ot Artesian Weils Indorsed
as Profitable to the Development oi
Agriculture—Report of the Committee
on Legislative Demands.
MiTCHElJy, Nov. 28.—Tho State Farmers'
alliance adjourned at a. m. yesterday.
The following were choscu delegates to the
National Farmers' Alliance and Industrial
Union: J. It. Lowe, J. 8. Bryan,E. V. Van-,
doran. C. L. Ilinkloy, A. Wardall, E. B.
Cummlngs, J. G. Crouse. The convention
above named convenes In Florida, Dec. 2,
and theso delegates started to-day for the
south to attend it.
Tho following are the resolutions adopted
by the state alliance:
The alliance of the state of South Dakota,
in convention assembled at Mitchell, Nov.
25, 1800, feeling grateful to the supreme
being for the blessings of health and tho
prosperity that has been vouchsafed to our
people during the past year, and our de
pendence upou him for every good do
assert:
1. That we solemnly affirm our devotion
to the cardinal principles of our organiza
tion heretofore announced in every meeting
of the alliance, and that we hold them par
amount to every party feeling that we
welcome to our order every good man or
woman of every political or religious opin
ion, who i.s devoted to the interests of agri
culture, and that we will never make such
opinions a test of membership in this order,
and that, as in the past, our motto shall be,
••in essentials, unity in non-essentials
charity."
2. That we again reaffirm our allegiance
to the platform of the National Farmers'
Alliance and Industrial Union adopted at
the last annual meeting at St. Louis.
i. That wo are unalterably opposed to
the creation or continuance ot any unnec
essary public offices, and demand, that the
salaries ot all public officers not fixed fn the
constitution shall correspond with the in
come of the productive Industries of the
state that in the administrative officers
of the state the stristest economy shall bo
practiced.
4. We denounce in the strongest terras
the creation ot expenses beyond the legiti
mate revenues of the state.
5. That we are satisfied that an extensive
system of Irrigation by artesian wells is es
sential to the profitable development of ag
riculture In the state, and we are anxious
that all practicable legislation shall be
enacted to secure the same at as early a
date as possible, and we are grieved to
think that the dominant political party of
this state should refuse to provide such
amendments to the constitution as would
allow the state to contribute to such a sys
tem, and submit the same to a vote of our
people at the late election for ratification
and thereby make it Impossible for the state
to aid in the accomplishment of such irri
gation for over two years to conte. And we
further deplore that our present representa
tion in congress used such untiring energy
In seektng and procuring appropriations
for unneeded and extravagant public build
ings and unearned services, and not one
dollar for the construction of a single well
or for the advancement of the Industrial
enterprises of the state.
The following Is the report of the com
mittee ou legislative demands:
I. That the Farmers' alliance, of South
Dakota, 'demands that tbe legislature submit
to the electors of South Dakota at the next
general election an amendment to the con
stitution forbidding the sale of any of the
school and public lands, and providing for
the proper leasing of the same.
5. That we are in favor of a uniform
series of text books for our public schools
and demand that the state furnish them to
the school boards at cost, and we demand
such legislation as will carry this resolution
into force and effect. And be it further re
solved that we demand a fair English edu
cation for every child In South Dakota.
3. We endorse the Australian ballot box
system of voting and demand of our next
legislature proper euactments to carry, the
same into full force and effect throughout
the state.
4. We demand such legislation as will
forever prohibit the employment of armed
bodies of men other than our state militia
at the call of the governor of the state.
5.. We demand a law fixing railway pas
senger rates at 2 cents por mile.
6. We demand legislation providing lor
the forfeiture of office of any state or
county officer accepting a freo railroad
pass.
7. We demand the election of our rail
road commissioners by the people and that
they be empowerad to make freight sched
ules for all state traffic, which rate shall be
prima facia evidence of reasonable rates.
8. We demand that the appraised valu
ation of railroads for purposes of taxation
be fixed at the value they are bonded for.
9. We demand thatour state be divided
Into congressional districts.
10. We demand that tho law governing
the time for redemption of real estate sold
under execution or foreclosure be changed
and extended to three years.
II. We demand the enactment of a law
taxing mortgages.
13. We demand that the coming legis
lature appoint an investigating committee
with power to send for persons and papers
and compdlling their attendance and pro
duction for the purpose of ascertaining if
any elected officer of this state has been
implicated in attempting to influence the
electors in the late election by the corrupt
use of money, and if the evidence shows
any person guilty we demand the in:mediatn
Impeachment of such official.
13. We demand of tbe coming legislature
that it enact such laws as will largely de
crease the fees and salaries of the various
county and state officials to the lowest pos
sible limit consistent with the proper dis
charge of the duties.
