Deposed Commissioner of
Markets Calls Dylan a
Hypocrite and Charges
rood Sale Graft Scheme
Says Deputy Smith
Proposed "Divvy"
Alderman to Ask Inquiry ;
former Aid Laughs at
Allegations of Chief
Dr. Jonathan ('. Dav. Commissioner
of Public Markets, was removed from
offi? ?' .. esterday by Mayor Hylan In
a letter dispatched to the Mayor last
nighl ? deposed commission? r told
the Mayor he was preparing to expose
Hylan':* "unfaithfulness and hypocrisy,"
adding:
"I reali e now aftei mj bi ief ex
'" rience in office that 1 was not ex?
pected by you and some of your inti?
mai advisers to serve the public, but
that I was expected to be a catspaw
for selfisl . base and sordid scheme ?
interests."
!a inquiry into charges by Dr Hay
thai William \V. Smith, whom Dr. Day
rei oved on Monda?, a deputy corn
mi oner, had approached him with a
schi - to divide surplus money from
the sale of army food, possibly svill be
conducted A the Board of Aldermen.
Alderman Jacob W. Friedman said ?ast
night he would introduce a resolution
. (V,
et.
Mulry \cting Commissioner
When Dr. Day arrived at his office
yesterday morning he found a letter
from the Mayor informing him that
si rvices no longer were required.
SI ? it',;, afterward the Mayor announced
the appointment of Deputy Commis
William P. Mulry, the only
nal deputy of the department in
this administration, to the Acting
Commissionership. Mr, Mulry lives
at ~A Parkside Avena?'. Brooklyn.
In discussing his dismissal yester?
day, Dr. Day said thai it came "after
a long series of differences between
myself, Commissioner of Accounts
Hirshfield and Deputy Markets Com?
missioners O'Mallcy .and Smith." He
added thai on November 28 he had
written to the Mayor, asking what dis?
position the latter had made of charges
brought by former Senator William M.
Bennett against Dr. Dav and heard by
Mr. Hirshfield. He/ said thai the
Mayor had replied by lettei that it
would take at least ten ?lays to sift the
ma of test imony.
Says Smith Proposed "Divvy"
Dr. Day said that this reply vas dc
?ivered to 1 m on Monday, shortly after
he had written to the Mayor informing
him of the removal of Deputy < ommis?
sioner Smith. In this letter Dr. Day
told the Mayor he had dismissed Srnitn
be. use he had let O'Mallcy dictate to
I him. The Commissioner informed the
Mayor that Mr. Smith had come to him
with a proposition to divide between
? them the prolits derived from the sale
of $3,000,000 worth of army surplus
food to the public. Referring to this,
! Ir Hay's letter to the Mayor said :
"Smith said in substance about as
fol ruvs: 'Now, I want to talk to you >n
mother way. Forget that you are
Commissioner and that I am Deputy
i 'on mi - - iouei. I .el me talk to you as
13 :,'? Smith to John Day. There is go?
ing to be a who c loi vi money left
over from the sale of army foods and
w?' can have it among ourselves.'
*'! said to him : 'Who can have it ? It
?s my opinion that the employees, who
. have pul in long hours, and the volun?
teer: , who have put in long hours with?
out pay and who have destroyed cloth
: : . I ou d have whatever margin there
aft? ;? all obligations are paid to the
army, to labor and to trucking.'
Rejected Proposal. Says Day
?'lio said: '1 mean that we here
j in the office can divide it among our
| selves, h belongs to us if it belongs
I to anybody.' My reply was: 'You
cannot divide a 5-cent piece with me
or among ourselves.' Then 1 said to
him: 'Did O'Malley send you to me
? , .;. thai ?' H?' said: 'Yes, but do
not bring me into it if you lava any?
more ' rouble with O'Malley.' "
Dr. Day also charged Mr. Smith with
transferring $110,000, held jointly by
I Smith and O'Malley, from the Public
? National Hank to the Greenpoint Na?
tional Hank. This money was part of
: the profits, Dr. Day said 'esterday,
and was not supposed to be removed
except with the consent of Corpora?
tion Counsel Harta whose consent had
not been obtained, Dr. Day also made
publie yesterday his letter to Mr.
Smith calling for the Hitter's resigna?
tion because of the transfer of this
money.
The clergyman alleged, in discussing
Mr. O'Malley's removal, which became
effective October 14, that the former
deputy had profiteered in the sale of
army "foodstuffs to the public. He de?
clared that, although Mr. O'Malley had
agreed to hold the city's margins to
two cents t>n a pound or can, the prices
had h? ?'n raised three cents and in
some instances seven cents.
Charges Deception by O'Malley
About $.'300,000 is now on deposit,
the ousted commissioner said, repre?
senting th?' profit on these sales. The
creation of this large surplus. Dr. Day
charged, was "the result of the direct
deception on the part of Mr. O'Malley."
Mr. O'Malley. in discussng these
charges last night, asked to be per

A- Hastings, the architi et a and -:
?Charles Allen, an English .-??.per'. Thi
purpose was to give th? art colled ...
a setting not so much like that of ?

might feel at home.
Women Planned Decorations
The interior decorations were di

Frick. \\y^. Prick's boudoir on tin
second floor, with its panels paintei
by Bom her, its exquisite furnitur.
and its Sevi e ; vase -, is one of I In
?most beautiful rooms; in any privat

Although he began collecting thirt;
years ago, it was not until recent yeai
that Mr. Friert, with the help of Si
Joseph Duveen, who ransacked liar.!.
in his patron'- behalf, was able t.. ad.
i to his treasure- many famous work
from the old world galleries, The re
suit has been a collection, rivaled onl
by the Widener ga!ler> in Philad? lull
Prominent among the paintings ar
those from the Italian school, which in
elude two portraits by Titian and Bel

Desert." His Spanish pictures are b
Goya, Velasquez and Greco, winch tori
a triumphant trio at one end of th
gallery. The Dutch school is saper!.;
represented. Rembrandt is conspicu

For the modern school Mr. Fric
showed enthusiasm. His latest pu
chase included the Whistler portrah
from the Richard Canfield collect am.
From the Morgan collection Mr. Frit
obtained beautiful Italian bronze
a famous set of black hawthorn Ch

busts by the French sculptor Houdc
and some magnificent Renaissan?
furniture from the Chabriercs-Arl?

Proud to Show Treasure*
Mr. Frick was always "at home" evi
to strangers who came to view his a
treasures. It was said he frequent
would inconvenience his family or i
terrupt a reception to show his gei
to persons who evinced enthusias
over them.
Art experts acquainted with th? ci
lection would not hazard a guess as
the value of the collection. "It
worth many, many million-." said 01
collector.
"Mr. Frick was a student and lov
of art," said Judge E. H. Gary. "I

self-contained and sine. The instrument of c I ref? rru in America is th?
ballot. The road to economic and social reform m America is 'he straigh
road of justice to all classes and conditions of men. Mer. have hut to
fallow this road to realize th-' full fru tion of their objects and purposes
Let those beware who would take the shorter roud if disorder and revolu?
tion. The right road .< the road of ?ustice and orderly process."
