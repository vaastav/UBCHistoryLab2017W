oidier boy re urned fnim th war, followed
hat he supposed to he a fox lor 70 Tcet into
cave- groping his way by the light of a
antern hung upon the end of his gun. A
pair of hip eyes in time told him that it was
do fox ; but it was too late to back out. As
he minted Lis "un at the creature, the
i "
ter "varmint" caught the muale in his i
aoatb, trhen Mr. Hill discharged the gan, j
ieavilT larded with buckshot, into the erca-
tareWcth, and through the back o. Lis
neck. T ha animal bounded forward, but j
with a hatchet, and the aid of his do', Mr. !

urday, and created a good deal of excite

ly the marks of sharp teeth.
TnK Late Kaiuoan Accident ix Niw
Jerset. The following are some details of
the accident at the White Iloufe.on the New
Jen-cy Central rtiilroad. on Friilay last, by
which seven ierjns lot their livnand lur
tecn were mere or lc&s severely wounded :
"It apneirs that a coal train going east lis-
coveredacir ofhsyonthe other track which
had broken from a freight train. Tbe express
train bound west was due, and the engineer 01
the coal train slipped his train and ordered the
brakemm to stop ths car or throw it from the
track, as it was going uown me graae preuy
rapidly. After stopping the c-ir he started his
train and foand that part of it had become un
coupled. He then backed up to couple the cars.
and while doing it the western express irain
bound east came round the curve and ran into
the rear of his train. W hen the engineer or the
western express train discovered the coal train.
it was anout eiglit nunoreu itei irom mm. 11c
reverscd his engine immedi itcly, but could not
stop the train. He did not jump from but stuck
to his engine to tec last. .o one en me engiue
cr in tbe baggage car was injured. The bag
gge ei was driven into the first p1;enger car.
and swipt as it were everything above the lops
of tbe iron sett tacks On the bottom of the
htgraje car were two piece of timber which
came directly over the teat on cither s.de next
the aisle, killing thi'Se sitting next the ais.e. nut
doing no serious injury to iho-e sitting next the
winloas. The ns-enz'rs in tbe other part of
the train sustained no itijury whatever."

.miiitains, by the exclusion of all colored

not upuUican, becaUKj they are rejectinc,
not s iinj ly colored individuals, but "gr. at
inarM-s of citizms.'" They ar prooing to
en-ct oli-archic.-, instead of republican gov
ernments. Mr. Davis puts it Nlatistically
tlius :
'Congress is asked to guaranty as Repub
lican such despotisms as tlxe : In North
Carolina, 031,000 ci-iitnt. ostracize 331,000
In Virginia, 713,000 citizens octmcize 533.

to the size 01 the London Times, and is now
the largest daily in this country, and as big
as tho biggest anywhere The Tiwes is an
ixample ot success, almost without prece
dent in the history 01 newspaper enterprise.
Started by Mr. Raymond in 1851 with a lit
tle sheet ol lour pages, it has grown steadily
in size, circulation and influence. Its re
ceipts have increased fp in $50,000, tho first
year, to $900,000 last year. It owns its
splendid building one of tbe best pieces ol
property in New York City and nets iu
proprietors a princely income. Prosperity,
however, as it is evident, does not dampen
the enterprise of its managcre.and the future
we doubt not will show still greater tri
umphs.

, beaiier wWgbt of cares than ever devolved
ur on any one of his predecessors. To fulfil
t my tru-t I nerd the support and confidence
of all a ho arc associated with nic in the ra
tions departments of Government, aud the
support and confidence of the people. There
is hut one way in which I can hope to gain
their r.eicssary aid ; it is. to stato with
trankiiCM the principle which guide iny
conduct, and their application to the present
state of nlfdirn, weilaware that the efficiency
ol ruy laboits will, in a great measure, de
pend on your and tneir undivided approoa
tion The Union cf the United States of Amer
ica waa intended by its authors to last as

Tut Union mull ee rEM-ETtaL" are the
words of the Confede.ation. ' To loan a

people of .he Unitid" Status, is the dcclarid
iiiiriiofc of the Constitution. Tho hand ol
livint; Providence was never more plainly
visible in the afiaira of men than in the
Imming and adopting of that instrument.
Il is, beyond coin) tirifoti, the greatest event
in American history; and indied is it not,
ot all events in modern times, the most preg
nant with consequences for every people or
tl v earth? Ibe members ol the Convention

mwer to enforui the his, puiii-li tieason,
aud ensure domestic traiiouiliir. Iu cae ol
the usuriuliun of the Guvernment ol n State
by one man, or an oligarchy, it tX'Cumee a
duty of the United States to tnako good the
guaranty to Unit state nl a republican I oral
of guve'inmeut, end so tc maintain the ho-
mogcniuusiuss of all. Dues the lapoc of
time reveal defects? A simple uiodo ol
amendment is provided in the Constitution
itsell. so that us conditions can itlwavs be'
made to conform to the riquiieuicnla of ad
vancing civilization .No room is allowed
even lor the thought of a pos-ihility of its
coming to an end. And these powers of
sell-preservatiun have always Iicen asserted
in their complete integrity ly every patri
otic Cliiel .Magistrate by Jttierson ana
Jackson, not less than by Washington and
Madison. Tbe parting advice of thn Father
ol his Country, while yet President, to the
people of the United States, was, that " the
tree Constitution, which was thu work ol
their hands, might be sacredly maintained ;"
and the inaugural words ot J'residcnt Jener
son held up tbe preservation of the Gene
ral Government, in its constitutional rigor,
as the sheet anchor of our peace atborse
and safety abroad-" The Constitution is
the work of " the People of the United
States," and it should be as indestructible as
the people.
Il is not strange that the frainer of the
Constitution, which had no model in the
pas!, should not have fully coin rcbended
the excellence of their own work. Fresh
from a struggle against arbitrary power,
many jAlnots suffered from harr.isiing fears
of an absorption of the State Governments
by the Gen"al Government, and many from
a Jrrad that the States would brrnk away
from their orbits. Hut the very grcntne.-t of
our country should allay the apprehension
of encroachments by tbe General Goiern
inrnt. The subji cts that conic unqucstiona
I ly within its jnrirdiction arc so numerous,
that it must ever naturally refuse to lie em
barrassed by questions that lie beyond it.
Were it otherwise, the Executive would sink
beneath the burden ; the channels of justice
would lie cltokcd ; legislation would lie nti
structed hy exces ; so that there is a grfut-e-r
temp'ation to exercise Homo of the func
tions of the General Goternineut through
ti e States than to tie.- bps on their rightful
sphcie. Tl.e absolute acquiescence in the
decision nl the lusj'inty" was, at the U

the first question that presented itself tor de
cision.
Now, military governments, established
for an indefinite period, would harcoGcrtd
no security lor tbe early suppression of dis
content ; would have divided the pcopln Into
the vanquishers and the vanquished ; and
would have envenomed hatred, rather than
have restored afiection. Once establish! d,
no piewiae limit to their continuance was
conceivable. They would have oveuMoned
an incalculable and exhausting cxpe:so.
Peaceful emigration to and from tint por
tion of the country is one of the host means
that can lie thought or for tho restoration of
harmony ; and that emigration would hr.ve
been picventeu ; for what emigrant frum
abroad, what industrious citizen nt home,
would place himself willingly under military
rule? The chief persons who would have
followed in tho train of tho aiiny would
have been deiendcnts on the General Gov
ernment, or men who expected profit from
ine miseries 01 ineir erring icllow-CHizpns.
The powers ol patronage and rule which
would have Ix-en exercised, under the Presi-de-nt,
over a vast, and populous, and natur
ally wealthy region, are greater than, un
less under extreme necessity, I should bo
willing to entrust to any one man ; they
are such, aa for uisclf, I could never, unless
on occasions of great eme rgency, consent to
exercise. Tho willful use of i-uch iwwcrs. if
continued through a period of years, would
have endAngered the purity of" the general
administration and the liberties of thc.Stitrs
which remained loyal.
Hci-ides, the policy of military rule over a
conquered territory would have implied that
the States whose inhabitants may have tak
en part in the rebellion had, hy the net of

to decide for K6elf the conditions for the en-

the period ot tnc ujnicaeracy ir.cre conti
nued to exist a very great diversity in me
qualifications of electors in the several

to the ora'cers who were to be chosen. The

these diversities when it enjoins that in the

during the civil war the late President never

nothing can be fuund which, during tho con

Hut while I have no doubt that now, after
the cloJij cf the war, it is not ejeuja-te t lor
the (unera! Government to ixtend th elec

rquallv clear that good faith requires the se

right to claim the just return nl their I imr.

trnment. I meet you at a time when the nation
has voluntirily burdened itself with a debt un
precedented tn our annals. Vast as is its
amount, it fides away into nothing; when com
pered with the countless blessing that will be
conferred upon our country and upon man by
the preservation of the natien's fife. Now, on
the first occasion of the meeting of Congress
since the return Of peace.' it ia of the utmost im
portance to inaugurate a just policy which shall
at once be put in motion, and which shall com.
mend itselt In those who come after us for its
continuance. We must aim at nothinz less
j than the complete e!f iceraent of the financial
evils tbit necccssanly followed a stale of civil
war. We must endeavor to apply the earliest
remedy to the deranged state of Ihe currency,
and not shrink from devising a policy which,
without being oppressive to the people, ehall
immediately begin to effect a reduction cf tbe
debt and.il persisted in, discharge it fully with
in a defiaitrly fixed number of years.
It is our first duty to prepire iu e truest fur
For that end, wo must, each in our respective
positions, prepate the way. I hold it the duty
of the Executive to insist upon fruzililv n the

in the prulent management of their monetary
afftirs, Ibe duly devolves oa ns lo diminish by

of the country amounted lo not much mere (hau

impulses of patriotism, the nvca of the great
body of the peoples without regard to their own
comparative want of. wealth, thronged to our
armies and 5IIed our fleets of war, and held
thecseivos ready to offer their lives for the pub
lic good. Noar, in their turn, the property and
income of the country should hear thtir ju3t
proportion of Ihe burden of taxation, while in
our impost system, thrtugh means of which
increased vitality is incidentally imparted to
all the industrial interests of th nation, the
duties should be so adjusted as to fill roost
heavily on articles of luxury, leaving necess tries
of life as fn-s from taxation as the absolute
wants of the Government, economically admin
istered, will justify. No favored class should
demand freedom from asie'smcct. and the Lues
should be so distributed as not to fall unduly on
the poor, but rather oa tbe accumulated weJth
of the country. We should look at the nation il
debt just as it is not as a national blessing, but
as a heivy burdrn on the industry of the coun
try, to be discharged without unnecssary delay.

present direction, u accomplishing much in de
veloping for utilizing the vast agricultural ca
pabilities ot the country, awl the information
respecting the details of its management refer

because of their transcendaot importance Un

tory and variety of clhn ite, presJaerng almost
everything thit is necessary for the wants, and.
even the comforts of man. make cs singularly

Potters, and protect us against every tempta
tion to " entangling airtanee",' while at tbe
present moment the re-establishment of b-irmo-uy,
and the strength that comes from harmony,
will be our best Siearity against " natrons who
feel power aud forget right." For myself, it.
has been and it will be my constant lis to pro
mote peace and amity with all foreign nations
and Powers ; and 1 have every reason to believe
that they all, without exception, are animated
by the sitae disposition. Our relations it. th tho
Emperor of China, so recent in their origin, are
most friendly. Oar con merce with his domi
nions is receiving new development; ; and il is
Terr pleasing to find that the Government of
that grit Empire manifests sitiifvetion with tui
policy, anl reposes just conSlence in tb fair
ness which marks oar intercourse. The unbrok
en harmony between the United States and the
Emperor of Batsii m receiving a new support
from an enterprise designed to carry Ulcgraphic
lines across tbe continent of Asia, through his
dominions, and so to connect us with all Europe
by a new chinned cf intercourse.
" Oar commerce with South America is about
to receive encouragement by a direct line of
miil sreimshtps to the rising Empire of ItroaX
The distinguished purly of mn of seiM who
have rwunUjr left our country to make a scien
tific exploration of the natural history and rivers
and mountain ranges of that region, have re
ceived frum the Emperor that generous welcome
which was tu have been expected irom his
constant friendship tar the United Slates, and
h'j well known zaal in promoting the adeance
raent of knowledge. A hops is entertained that
our commerce with the rich lad populous coun
tries that border the Sledittrreoa sea may be
largely increased. Nothing will be wanting, on
the part ot'thts Government, to extend th- pro
tection ofourtli; over the enterprisj of our fsl-lw-citi:enj.
We receive from the Powers in
that region assurances of good will ; and it is
worthy of note thitaspeciil envoy has brought
us messiges of condolence on tho death of our
bile th.ef Slagtstrate from the By of Tunis,
whose rule includes the old dominions of Car
thage, on tbe African coast.
Our domestic contest now happily ended, has
left some traces ia cur relations, with one at
least of the great miritime Powers. Tho formal
accordince of belligerent rights to the insurgent
States was unprecedented, and has not been
justified by the issue. But in the systems of
neutrality pursed by ths Powers which made that
concession, there was a marked difference The
materials of war for the insurgent States were
fun.isbed, in a great measure, front the work
shops ef Great Britain ; and British ships.
minneil by British subjects, and erired for
receiving ISritisti armaments, ei-.Ied from the
ports of Great Britain to mike war on American
commerce, under tbe shelter or a commission
from the insurgent States. These ships, hiving
once escared Irom British ports, ever afterward
entered them In-every pirtcf the world, to refit,
and so to renew their depredations. Tbe con
sequence! of thisconduct were most disastrous
to the States then in rebellion, increasing their
desolation and misery by the trolongation of
cur civil contest. It had, moreover, the effect,
to a great extent, to drive the American flag
from ihe sei, and to transfer much of our ship
ping and our commerce to the very Power whose
subjects hid created the necessity fer such a
changr. These events took place before I was
called lo the administration of the Government
The s rncere desire fur peace by which I an ani
mated led me to ajprove the proposal already
made, to submit the questions which hid th s
arisen between tbe countries to arbitration.
These questirons are of such moment that they
must have commanded the attention of the great
Powers, and are so interwoven with the peace
and interest of every one of them as to have en
sured an impartial decision. I regret to inform
you thit Great Britain declined the arbitrament
but, on the other hand, invited us to the forma
tion of a joint commission to settle mutual
claims between the two countries, from which
those for the depredations before mentioned
should be excluded. The proposition, in that
very unsattsf ictory furm, has been declined.
The United States di 1 not present the sub
ject as an impeachment of the goes! faith of a
Power which was professing the meat friendly
dispositions, bat as Involving questions of pub
lic Iw, of which the settlement is essential to
the peace of nations; and, though pecuniary re
paration to their injured citizens would have
followed incidentally on a decision against Great
Britain, sucTr cbmpemntibn was not their prima
ry object. They hid a higher motive, and it
was in the interests cf peace and justice to es
tablish important principles of international
law. The comrspcndcnce will be placed before
you. The ground on which the DritUh Slinister
rests his justification is, substantially, that the
municipal liw cd" a nation, and tho domestic in
terpretations of that liw, are tho measure ol its
datyaiancotral; and I feel bound to declare
my opinion, before you and before the world,
thit thit justificaticn cannot be sustained before
the tribunal of nations. At the same tirae I do
not advise to any present attecpt at redress by
acts of lcgu!ttit. For the future, friendship
betwvtn, Ihe two countries must rest on the ba
sis of nntuil Justice.
