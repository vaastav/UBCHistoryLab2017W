Madrid Dec SThe premier Senor
Sagasta in a Interview referring to
President McKinleys message to con
gress Is quoted as saying he thinks
the message satisfactory because the
threat to intervene in Cuba was made
I qnly to give satisfaction to a portion
of American opinion without the in
tention of executing it
Continuing the premier said that the
government would not make a declar
ation on the subject He believed that
the presidents words would have In
fluence with the insurgents and added
that the cartes would not be convened
until the government has ascertained
the effect of the message upon the
United States congress
SHOWED CLEVERNESS
The Impartial commenting on the
message a ays
It shows a certain cleverness and
evil intention when it refers to filibus
tering expeditions McKinley speaks
with what appears to be excessive
cynicism to those who have not lost all
notion of justlcs This government
must show the Yankees that the Span
ish fag floats over Cuba and that they
have yet to tear it down
In conclusion the Imparcial remarks
The manufacture and sale of arms is
not the same thing a using them

the senate has written to Senor Sa

CARLIST MANIFESTATIONS
Tomorrow the Carlist deputies will
meet to discuss President McKinleys
message to congress It is said they
Intend to provoke popular manifesta
tions against the message
According to a dispatch from Barce
lona Lieutenant General Weyler in
the course of an interview there has
felicitated himself on being attacked
by President McKinley In the message
a this proves that his Weylers
policy was displeasing to the enemies
of Spain He expressed his surprise
that the Spanish government would
tolerate such attacks upon the repre
sentatives of the nation
OFFICIAL ORGAN SAYS
La Correspondia Espano the official
organ says that after reflection Span
ish opinion on President McKinley is
more optimistic than at first It pro
ceeds to impugn the sincerity of the
presidents protestation of friendship
for Spain and of respect for interna
tional obligations but it admits that
the message was addressed to congress
personally and in language though not
intended to please Spain will annoy
jingoes and filibusters
flbuster
SATISFACTION VISIBIE
Outside of official circles satisfaction
is very visible in financial circles and
also of the general public Among
statesmen the most pleased is Castello
who compares the conduct of McKinley
with that of Grant and says that he
believes firmly that all the sane and
respectable elements of the
ekment common
wealth will follow suit

attempt to convey a store of munitions
of war to the Cuban insurgents just
succeeded at the moment when i had apparently
In about the middle of September a
steamer painted black appeared near
Cienfuegos and landed a stock of ammunition
munition and 20 men under the lead of
Jose Cepero a naturalized American
citizen who after being held in a Cu
ban jail for nearly a year was released
by the Spanish government last July
The expedition got inland but a month
later the Spanish authorities discovered
yearly 500 boxes of ammunition for
Remington and Maussr rifles concealed
in a shallow creek and carried them
into town Later on Cepero led an at
tack on a small town and killed several
of the inhabitants including a woman

I Washington Dec 8In his invoca
tion at the opening or the senate to
j day Rev W H MSlburn the chaplain
delivered a brief and touching eulogy
I of the late Senator George of Missis
sippi
I Mr Allen of Nebraska presented a
resolution declaring i to be the sense
i I of the senate that congress should with
all due and convenient speed accorded
I I by appropriate act acknowledge the po
i litical independence of Cuba Mr Al
len said that he had long urged that the
United States should recognize the in
dependence of the Cuban Insurgents
He would not be content with the recognition
ognition of belligerency but would in
sist upon the acknowledgement of ab
solute independence He was satisfied
that the people would not be content
with the course advised by the admin
istration Inasmuch as the Cubans for
more than two years on many battle
I I fields had demonstrated their valor and
j love for liberty he felt that they had
i earned a recognition of their political
liberty and that it ought to be ac
I corded to them without further tem
I porizing If necessary this recognition
should be backed by a fleet of American
can vessels in Cuban waters
THOSE OPPOSED
He expressed a belief that the owners
of the Spanish bonds in this country
American citizens holding property in
Cuba that had been injured or de
stroyed by the insurgents and the car
rying trade of the country which
might be affected by such a step had
joined to prevent the recognition of
Cubas political independence
SCORES THE PRESIDENT
Mr Allen expressed the belief that
President MeKinleys statement in his
message that the recognition of the
belligerency of the Cuban insurgents is
now unwise and therefore inadmissible
would be a great disappointment to the
members of the Republican party
throughout the United States The na
tional convention of that party had
declared in favor of the independence
of Cuba going farther than the simple
recognition of belligerency
RANK HYPOCRISY
He thought that the president was
under obligations to carry out the
pledge which his party had made a
pledge which had been made to 73000
000 people The president Mr Allen
thought had been lulled to sleep by
the declaration of Spain that she would
give Cuba a semipolitical existence
He expressed the belief that the presi
dents neglect to take such action a
would insure the political independence
of Cuba a an exhibition of rank hy
pocrisy and a flagrant neglect of
public duty which would be cor
rected by the allruling power in his
own good time
MARK OF RESPECT
At the conclusion of Mr Allens re
marks Mr Hoar presented a resolution
expressing the regret of the senate at
the news of the death of Representa
tive Ashley B Wright of Massachu
setts and providing for an adjourn
ment as a further mark of respect At
1255 oclock the resolution was
adopted and the senate adjourned

New York Dec 8At midnight the
18 were still pedaling their way lap
after lap around the highbanked floor
of Madison Square Garden From
midnight to midnight Miller had put
more than 350 miles behind him This
marvelous record on tlv third day of
the great race carried him along to a
total of more than 1200 miles in 7
hours 139 miles ahead of the former
record During this weary Journey
Miller has left the track but for a few
hours With the exception perhaps of
Stephane the Frenchman Miller had
up to late in the afternoon less
sleep than any other man on the track
And notwithstanding this MHler is
seemingly in as good condition as he
was yesterday when experts claimed
that he and Rice the Wilkesbarre coal
miner were in the best shape of all
the riders
NEXT TO MILLER
The next man to Miller at the present
time is Rice and he is something y ore
than 50 miles behind but he is strons
and seems to have the same determin
ation that carried him almost to the
front in the big race of last year Last
years champion Teddy Hale whose
great ride then promises to be far out
done this year is now making up
ground He is almost 175 miles behind
the leader but nevertheless he has
crept up from tenth place which he
held last night to eighth place and is
certain to go much higher before the
end is reached
After 60 hours of what seemed to
Americans to be the fiercest kind of
rivalry Stephane has given in to Ri
vierre and the latter has put more
than a hundred miles between himself
and his fellow countryman Indeed
Rivierre holds a dangerous place in the
front ranks He is third man in the
race and has a good lead on those be
low him
STEPHANES SULKS
Stephane took the sulks tonight
which accounts for his losing ground
He disappeared from the track for a
couple of hours and even after that
only rode at intervals WaIler who
made such a wonderful effort during
the second day and became stubborn
has returned to his work with renewed
vigor but he is now far behind
MAN TO BE WATCHED
The man to be watched from now out
froU
is Teddy Hale the champion The
foxy work hinted at by his friends
earlier in the week Is beginning to be
come apparent From a despised
tailender he moved up within the
past 24 hours until at 8 oclock tonight
he had passed Pierce and forged into
sixth place with 140 miles between
him and the leader
MARVELOUS WORK
Millers work is marvelous He goes
pumping away in a peculiar manner
that is as effective as deceptive and
he manages to keep 50 miles between
himself and Rice who is pushing hard
to fill the gap Waller is making a i
mighty effort but i seems a fruitless i
one to get back to the front There I
is too much ground for him to cover
and if he comes in one two three he
will be a wonder

Pocatello Idaho Dec 8The passenger
senger trains were delayed here this
morning on account of a slight accident
which occurred at Port Neuf sdi =
six miles south of Pocatello Train No
8 the southbound passenger left here
at 330 this morning and ran into a
northbound freight which was occupy
ing the siding at Porf Neuf but which
owing to the number of cars in the
train was not entirely clear of the
main line Precautions were taken to
stop the passenger train and No8 had
nearly come to a stop when the engines
came together So slight was the shock
that some of the passengers were not
aware of the occurrence until some
minutes afterwards
Superintendent Van Housen was at
the scene an hour later with a wreck
ing train and a good force of men and
by 9 oclock all trains were rolling to
wards their destinations No one was
injured and the damage was small
STATEMENT OF PASSENGERS
William Firth and G L Wattis of
Uintah Weber county were aboard the
southbound Short Line train when it
collided with a northbound freight near
Pocatello One of these gentlement
said to The Herald
We got on at Pocatello and were in
the chair car The collision occurred
at about 4 oclock in the morning at
near the first station south from Poca
tello The force threw me under the
chair just ahead of me The brakeman
rushed in and tried to get at the lever
behind my chair to cut off the air but
he had to rush outside to do i A few
of the passengers were pretty badly
shaken up but i was all over before
there was time to be frightened I ex
amined the engines and scene of the
smashup The passenger engine seem
ed to have suffered the worst The
smokestack pilot and headlight were
demolished the tender was jammed
against the boiler head and the en
gine was humpbacked the rear drive
wheels being lifted off the rails I
struck me as curious that the mail car
to which the engine had been coupled
was damaged less than the baggage
car which came next The baggage car
I was thrown forward off its trucks The
mail car had its drawheads smashed
The freight engine had its pilot head
light and smokestack stove in The
report was current about the wreck
that the freight had orders to wait but
was trying to make Pocatello either
through a misunderstanding of orders
or through disobedience of them How
ever none of the railroad men would
say a word about the wreck and there
may be another story Had the acci
dent happened a little further along
lots of cars would have gone over the
bank I was storming when the colli
sion occurred Our train crew was
changed at Pocatello and a new one
brought us on to Ogdcn where we ar
rived at 330 p m instead of 730 a m

RIO GRANDE EARNINGS I
Big Increase Over the Month of I
October
According to a statement recently is
sued there was again in the business
of the Denver Rio Grande for the
month of November of 188000 as com
pared with that done for the month
than for any month since the financial I
panic of 1893 Usually the month of i
November is a good one owing to the
increase in coal shipments but this
fall the business from the northwest
which has come in through the Ore
gon gateway is the cause of the im
mense gain in earnings The officials
of the road state that It is impossible
to ascertain what per centage of busi

From accounts printed in the eastern
press it would seem that Buffalo j
Jones whose name is as familiar in Utah
as it is in Kansas or elsewhere is lost
somewhere along the Saskatchewan or
Athabasca rivers up in the Northwest j
Territory Buffalo wrote to friends last
August stating that he was going up
north and that he would communicate
with them from somewhere near Prince
Albert but from that time nothing has
been hoard of him
Jones had visited this region before
when he brought back a herd of 85 bison
but he did not have to go into the wildsr
ness after themhe simply bought the
bunqh and brought them into tho United
States on the hoof
It was in June of this year that Jones
organized an expedition to go into the
Northwest Territory and capture i pos
sible a few specimens of that rare animal
the musk ox I is found only in the I
frozen region and for the purpose of I
assisting him four cowboys joined his
happy band They were men who had I
been with him before and Jones was
happy because the men were not strang i
ers They had plenty of provisions
enough to last all winter if need be and
were in good spirits when they left II
t <
Jones has a wonderful history He was
born in Illinois but that state was too I
tame for a man of his kidney and with I
the education he had acquired at the I
State Normal and Wesleyan Universities
west to Kansas I
at Bloomington he came
settling across the river from 51 Joe Life I
here was too slow so Jones traveled west
to Garden City where tho crowd rushed
during the boom A town of 2000 people
was built in almost one night and Jones I
was the high man among all He built a
block of buildings which would have done
credit to a large city and then turned his I
attention to irrigation He built miles of
ditches and was a financial whirlwind
while he lasted I
Jones earned his prefix Buffalo in 1S86
when he organized a buffalo hunt and
with 1 calves captured on tho expedition j
began the propagation of the bison with I
more or less success His plan was to
cross them with native cattle and make
himself famous and rich I did not pan
out as might have been expected
I was in 18S4 that Jones attained a
prominence which made hire kiown om
ocean to ocean and from the Gulf to Man
itoba He was a delegate from Kansas I
to the Republican national convention and
was a Elaine man from start to finish In
Chicago he had a banner painted adorned
Wgao sh r
with shocks of wheat and corn and other
agricultural products and then in letters
I
of gold the following S
50000 For the KANSAS Nominee of the Con
500 ventlon I
75000 For Elaine
Wheat and Corn For the Nation I
Fall In
On top of this was a rooster vith the I i
motto Kansas crows for her loyal dele j
gates On the third ballot in the con
vention Jones came down the aisle with
this banner and the convention went wild I
He had pictures of Elaine and Logan on
the same and everybody just rose up and
screamed Dan Honin the Railway News
Reporter man in Omaha was there Dan
has a voice which rings like a clarion He
wanted Elaine because he believed he
could be beaten When Jones struck the
floor with that banner Honin began
shouting Elaine Elaine Blaine The
famous woman in the gallery began
waving her handkerchief and sending up
her shrill voice in answer to Honins cries
and there never was such a scene any
where Blaine got there
Then Jones came farther west He
landed here He started a buffalo farm
beyond Garfield ahd the noble animal
which was killed by A N McKay the
Canadian Kit Carson on Antelope island
last winter full details of which appeared I
in The Herald at the time was one of the
remnants of that band of bison which
used to cavort and gambol around the
park to the edification of visitors I
Jones left the Republican party two
years ago and joined the Populist party I
of which he was a momber when he dls j
appeared

A Market for American Eggs I
London Echo In response to several
inquiries by American firms the United
States consul at Stuttgart has sent
home a report that Germany next to
Great Britain is the largest consumer
of eggs in Europe The net annual im
ports approximate 125000000 dozen The I
reasor why Germany connot pioduee I
sufllCi eggs for home consumption
is excessive dampness of tho climate I
which causes a great mortality among
chickens The eggs are imported
chiefly from Russia Austria Italy and i
Holland The consul fancies that there I
is in the country an excellent chance I

ALASKA GARRISON
Reports of Department Commanders
Express Satisfaction With the
New KragJorgenson Rifle Post
School Now in Active Operation
Notes and Personals of Interest
I
Ask a soldijr at Fort Douglas what Is
going on and all the answer you will get
is Klondike Klondike is the name
given to the new reservoir that is being
remodelled in the canyon Every day is
consumed in hard work on this place and
the temperature if one can believe the
reports about f is on a par with Klon
dike Since the cold weather has begun j
it is a disagreeable task that is before the
men but they go about it cheerfully and
without much grumbling S
That is about all that Is going on in
the little city on the hill There are no 11
drills or parades and the work on the
reservoir is about all there is to pass r
away the time Last Tuesday being the j
last day of the month the troops were J
mustered and held their regular monthly i
inspection Now the principal subject
that is interesting the soldiers is pay day
hhtiin always a welcome day for the j
boys and is eagerly looked forward to
with pleasant anticipations
o < < >
Speaking of pay day reminds one that
the detachment of men and officers that
are now on duty in Alaska are not in a
situation to be paid monthly I would be i
a pretty hard thing for the men in that
part of the country i they ware to get
snowed in for several months and 1
could not get any pay during
that time But Uncle Sam had
his eyes open and provided for
Just such a possibility The command of
officers and men under Lieutenant Colonel
G 11 Randall Eighth infantry who are
now in Alaska at the new post have
been paid for eight months in advance
This was done under the provisions of r
section 354S R S which permits pay
ments in advance to those employed on
mitar or naval service at distant sta
tions where payments cannot be regularly
made in the ordinary manner I the boys
are as free with their pay in Alaska as
they are here then eight months pay will
last them but a short space of time
> > <
Now that the reports of the department
commanders are all in as is also the re
port of the inspector of small arms prac
tice a word in regard to the new rifl >
will not be out of place These reports
are almost unanimous in their expressions
of satisfaction with the KragJorgenson
rifle in its present high state of perfec
tion A few requests 107 a wind guage
still continue to come to the war depart
ment but they are more Infrequent than
formerly It is thought that after the
new arm has been in the service a little
longer these requests will cease and the
soldiers will find that they can do as well
without as with It When it Is considered
that more than 20 years were consumed
in perfecting the Springfield rifle all the
arms having been called in twice for
changes to be made in them the approxi
mately perfect state of the new arm al
ready attained is most remarkable It has
been found by actual practice that the
new ride is far superior in shooting quail
ties to the old one and those who were
oposed to it In the beginning now swear
by the KragJorgenson

The quartermasters department of the
army will probably adopt for regular
service in a short time the tents of drab
color a small number of which were re
cently issued to various posts for trial
All the reports that have thus far been
received have been favorable to the
adoption of the tents which appear to be
giving universal satisfaction
