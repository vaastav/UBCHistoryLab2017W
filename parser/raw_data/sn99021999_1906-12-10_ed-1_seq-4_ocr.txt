TS COAL LAXD COSSriRACT-
Tha facts on which the indictments
are now being found in Utah for vio
lation of the national land and anti
discrimination laws bring out in gross
est form a gigantic and ruthless con-
piracy against public Interest. Its
purpose and accomplished result was
to rob the public, first of coal lands
by frauds under the land laws and
then by monopoly in the coal taken
therefrom by collusion between the
mining and railroad companies. It has
been demonstrated beyond a pel-adventure
that this double robbery has
been consummated by an elaborate
system of perjury, forgery and fraud,
whereby the title to the coal in the
ground was alienated from the people
and by rebates and discriminatory
railroad practices to extort excessive
prices from the people for the coal.
The fact that the conspirators are
great transportation and mining cor
porations, in many cases the latter
representing or being identical in in
terest with the former and their in
fluential responsible agents, only en
hances the turpitude and dangerous
character of the crime. It means that
the tremendous power of these corpor
ations, by reason of their wealth and
their influence over the business com
munity, and in politics, has been sys
tematically exerted, not in serving,
but in exploiting the public. The omi
nous fact, too, is clearly established
that public administration, either
lgnorantly or corruptly, has largely
failed over a period of years to afford
protection against the conspiracy,
whose widely ramified operations have
been carried on right under the noses
'. the authorities.
While the indictments already found
include some important offenders and
cover acts by which immense frauds
have been perpetrated, it is at the
same time obvious that only the fringe
of the conspiracy has as yet been ex
posed. Beyond question the same sys
tem of perversion of the national laws
has been carried on throughout the
mountain states wherever coal exists
nd could be made the means of ex
tortion by the collusion of mining and
transportation corporations. Nothing
more signally demonstrates the neces
sity of drastic national legislation for
destroying the transportation discrimi
nations by which coal monopoly has
thrived after the coal lands had been
stolen from the national domain, or
the timeliness of the popular agita
tion and demand that the laws for
their conservation shall be vindicated,
no matter how high and powerful the
conspirators may be.
APPEAL Fur the pkople
Attorney General Moody In his
annual report properly gives first place
to the recommendation, so emphatic
ally urged by the president in his
message, that the law be amended to
give to the United States the right of
appeal upon questions of law. Such
amendment as a general facility for
Justice Is of great and growing im
portance, but it is practically almost
vital to prompt and substantial prog
ress under those laws which bear espe
cially upon the illegal acts of corpora
tions and their officers, agents and
confederates.
The importance of judicial practice
in all these questions can hardly be
overestimated, and a very large part
of the success in subordinating cor
porations to public, authority in the
last two years has been achieved by
decisions applying old principles of the
law to existing Industrial and social
conditions. But among the still un
corrected anachronisms of criminal
practice few are more Irrational and
mischievous than the rule that blocks
review by the higher court of the trial
udge's rulings on legal questions in
criminal trials. The least of the mis
chief is the effect of blunder in favor
of the defendant so far as he alone
is concerned, but as a precedent in
extensive jurisdictions incalculable
harm may be and in fact often Is
inflicted against public interests.
It Is not proposed In the slightest to
put a defendant twice In jeopardy for
the same offense, but simply to pro
tect the public in its right to have the
law certainly and promptly ascertained
and settled, to the end that, erroneous
and pernicious rulings of the trial
courts may not taint and obstruct the
whole administration of the law. Not
withstanding the conservative tend
ency in criminal practice, this much
needed amendment has already been
made in a number of the states, with
salutary results. It is Incomparably
more necessary to the efficiency of the
national criminal code.
PRISlDIfTT FISH'S D1STIXCTIOX.
Stuyvesant Fish, late president of the
Illinois Central, dealing with the sub
ject of combination abuses, makes the
pregnant statement that "The contest
is no longer between those who have
and those who have not, but between
those on the one hand who have mod'
erately, sufficiently, and even abund
antly, and those on the other hand
who through the use of trust funds
and the power Incident thereto seek
by questionable practices to have ex
cluslvely.M The distinction goes to the
root of the universal disquietude over
prevalent corporation methods, and
comprehends the Issue that is every
day being mora distinctly drawn be
tween the mass of actual property
owners and the comparatively few who
under existing Industrial conditions of
concentration and organization are en
trusted with the custody and manage
ment of the combined wealth of others.
The question Is really mora ethical
than economical, although In final
analysis good ethics is good econo
mics. It is natural and Indeed inevita
ble that the champions of existing cor
poration abuses should stigmatise all
j effort for rafora as anarchistic and
nsplred by the envy and jealousy of
those . who through their own fault
have nothing and whose aim Is merely
to loot wealth. The fact, on the con-
rary, Is, and cannot how be obscured,
that common sense and the impulse
of self-preservation have forced the
people to assert themselves to hold
their own against the overreaching
and machinations of trustees whose
agency and powers cannot In this day
be avoided. It Is absolutely not a
crusade against wealth, but one of the
owners of wealth against despollers
and traitors.
UUXICIPAL CIVIL SERVICE.
Whatever changes may or may not
be made in the city charter for Omaha
by the coming legislature, some pro
vision should be enacted that will In
augurate a substantial form of mu
nicipal civil service for us.
There are more square pegs in
round holes in the city nail today than
there ever were before in recent years,
and more money is being paid out in
salaries to employes who are utterly
unable or unfit to render adequate
service la return. The award of
places on the municipal pay roll now,
more than ever before, seems to be de
termined by political claims and per
sonal need rather than by any qualifi
cation to perform the duties.
The mere fact that a man happens
to be a democrat or a republican and
active in the party propaganda does
not necessarily make him competent
to serve the city In capacities requir
ing special skill or unusual intelli
gence. Other cities have grappled
with this condition by creating mu
nicipal civil service boards, modeled
more or less upon the national civil
service boards and requiring appli
cants for appointive places to undergo
reasonable tests of their qualifications
for the places they desire. Such a
board could make up an eligible list
from which the appointing power
might be left free to select and in this
way the utterly Incompetent would, at
least, bo weeded out.
Of course care should be taken to
safeguard membership In the civil
service board against debasement into
political machine, but this should
not be difficult. The jurisdiction of
the board should be made to extend
over all branches of the municipal
service whether under tne mayor and
council, the police board, the water
board, the library board or the park
board. In this way employment by
the municipality would be brought
closer to the basis of employment by
private corporations and the employes
would likewise be reasonably pro
tected in their tenure of office, except
tor Incompetency or misbehavior. Bet
ter still, it would reduce the element
of political Interference to the mini
mum and hold out assurance to the
taxpayers that they would get some
thing tangible for the money con
tributed to the city government.
The incoming legislature is likely to
be called upon to make some inquiry
as to the conditions at the normal
schools. Charges made in connection
with the management of these institu
tions are sufficiently serious to war
rant the most rigid investigation. The
inquiry should be made promptly and
impartially, and with a view solely to
determining the truth.
Injunctions may retard, but they
cannot forever prevent the collection of
taxes. Sooner or later the railroad
companies will have to settle with the
state and counties and will find out
that they must contribute like any
other citizen to the support of the gov
ernment.
The announcement that a Peoria
distillery will devote its full capacity
of 8,000 bushels of corn per day to the
manufacture of denatured alcohol
brings attention to the fact that locally
no effort Is being made to. use any part
of Nebraska's corn crop for this pur
pose.
An interstate commerce commis
sioner declares the legal dissolution of
the Northern Securities merger pro
duced no appreciable effect on the
Interested railroads, which shows that
legal and business advisors are often
more efficacious than the law.
The decision of a Wisconsin educator

acy; Interviews with men from widely

played to uphold California individually

These men realise that in its final form

MORE CHANCE FOR LIFE.
General Prosperity Take a Fall Oat
of the Grim Reaper.
Cleveland Leader.
Rising prosperity keep step with falling
death rate. This Is not a condition pe
culiar to the United States. It Is general
in the civilized world. There ve proofs
which cannot be questioned that the aver
age period of life Is being, lengthened. Death
comes later and I more successfully beaten
off In the year when life ha had no fair
opportunity to attest It productiveness and
Its value.
Broadly speaking, this Is the most stu
pendous change of the times. Life may be
so misused that it Is not worth while. It
may be worse than the void which is Its
alternative. But obviously nothing human
Is possible without life and the waste of
life Is th squandering at all human oppor
tunities. What proteots life and prolongs
It guards the vital capital of the world.
It Is beyond question that this Immensely
important lengthening of life Is due, In the
main, to the prevention of disease rather
than It cure. Sanitary science has accomp
lished more than medicine; more, even,
than surgery and sick room wisdom. The
falling mortality rate ar the result of
drainage, cleanliness, . .the Isolation of In
fectious diseases, the better knowledge of
epidemic and their causes, the more care
ful use of food. The change means a step
toward natural living, in respect to fresh
air and wholesome condition in houses.
Civilized man Is returning to nature, but
with wisdom and resources which the na
tural man the savage always lacked. Ha
Is coming back to flrBt principles, In large
degree, as far as open air and wholesome
food and reasonable exercise go, but with
raatly greater power 'of guarding Ma own
body against disease and keeping children
and the aged, the feeble and the infirm, out
of peril of death.
This one fact ought to be sufficient to in
sure vast gains for the welfare of mankind.
Time arid force and thought saved from the
battle against death ..and disease can be
given to enriching and bettering life. When
mere existence Is more secure all that
adorns and elevates it will be more easily
and abundantly gained.
LETTER CAHrflERS' HOME.
Institution for the Care of Broken
Down Members.
Philadelphia Press.
A project that Is attracting; the attention
of the letter carriers of the country is the
establishment of a home for those members
of the National Letter Carriers' association
who may be attacked by consumption or
other pulmonary troubles. A site has al
ready been secured in Colorado Springs and
the Initial steps taken toward Its establish
ment. It I gratifying to know that the letter
carriers themselves are laying the financial
foundation for tills most praiseworthy In
stitution. The Brooklyn, N. Y., carriers
have announced that they will raise 110,000
and that when this sum in cash Is In their
treasury a wealthy .citizen of Brooklyn has
promised to add an additional 115,000 to It.
The New York association, which num
ber 7,000 members, also announces that It
will subscribe 125,000 to the building fund.
Th Philadelphia carriers are working
earnestly to make a substantial showing
for this city, while In other great "business
center th men are laboring zealously for
the cause.
There Is no doubt that after a substantial
um has been subscribed by the carriers of
the country themselves, the great corpora
tions and leading business men will give It
a very substantial Increase. There 1 no
class of public servants who come Into such
intimate dally touch with th business In
terest of this country a the letter car
rier. As a rule they are men of intelli
gence, integrity and uprightness. Their
calling I on which In many case predis
pose th physically weaker among them
to pulmonary attacks through exposure to
the element.
No better place In th country than Colo
rado Spring could be chosen for a letter
carriers' home. It I located in a high, dry
atmosphere. The International Printers'
home Is already located there, and through
it means score of lives have been pro
longed which otherwise would bar yielded
quickly to the whit plague.

BITS OF WASHINGTON LIFB
Mlaor Beeae sal larldeat ketet

Without mental reservation or fear of
the future, the Washington Herald pro
nounces Congressman Smith of Council
BlufT a smooth a story teller as ever
c a trie down the Iowa pike. ' The othSr day
he tried one on his fellow members from
Missouri. A democratlo convention wa
held In Missouri, Just over th, Iowa line.
Th Iowa congressman happened to be
there. The movement for supplanting II
men with young men In the administration
of Missouri affairs had reached high tide
in that part of th state, where was held
th convention, attended by Judge Smith.
It so fell out, however, that a local
patriarch of great renown wa a candidate
for one of the offices for which nomina
tion were to b made by the democrat
In convention assembled. An eloquent Mla
sourlan presented the name and exalted
the merits of th patriarch. "Gentlemen of
the convention, representative of the un
terrified democracy of th 'Steenth district
of Missouri," he shouted In a great burst
of oratory, "It I my honor and my pleas
ure to present to you the nam of a man
old In year, but young In spirit; one who,
though approaching the span of Ufa allot
ted by the poalmlst, has never taken a
Uoe of medicine; one who"
Here th orator' peroration was cut
short by a shrill voles from th audience,
exclaiming:
"We'll give him a dose today, all right."
"And they did," declared Judge Smith.
In th course of hi very Interesting de
scription of th president' Panama trip,
William Inglls, Special correspondent for
Harper' Weekly, who was with Mr. Roose
velt at Panama, recounts some amusing
and characteristic Incident of the tour of
observation.
The president and his party, In the course
of a tour of Inspection of the laborers'
quarters, visited a rooking shed. The presi
dent asked them about the food they get
at the commissary. They said It was good.
"Invariably" began a tall, yellow man
from Antigua, but the chattering crowd cut
him off.
"Invariably" he began again, but the
conversation swept past him. He made a
pet of the word and at Intervals repeated It
a a bittern In the quags repeats his boom,
until at last Mr. Roosevelt halted him with,
"Invariably whatT"
"Invariably, sare, the commissary are
bad," said the Antiguan, exulting In the
sound of his own voice uttering big words.
"Ah! let's go look at It," the president
cried. Off trooped th crowd to the com
missary store, and the wordy yellow man
under a fire of question modified his "In
variably" to the extent of declaring that
sometime the yams were bad. The store
keeper protested that If the bad yam wer
brought bark he always gave good ones
In their stead.
"Have you ever brought back bad yams
to be exchanged?" the president asked.
"No, sare," replied the Antiguan with
crushing dignity; "no, sare I would not
stoop so low."
The president smiled grimly at the Idiocy
of. the Antiguan and hurried off to climb a
slippery, muddy hill and Inspect the quar
ters of the married laborers.
In vain does Rev. Dr. Kdward Kverett
Hale continue to Invite the Ustenln; senate,
which stands with bowed head wh.,e he Is
appealing lor divine grace to descend upon
It. to Join him In the Lord's prayer. He
daily concludes his eloquent Invocation
with the prayer which the Saviour of man
kind uttered to His twelve disciples, and
asked the senate to say It with him. When
Senator Clark of Montana Is In his seat
his high tenor sometimes Is heard lisping
the sacred words. Occasionally the well
known voice of Senator Depew articulates
the prayer very lowly, but even he did not
repeat the words yesterday. Hon. Knute
Nelson's Hps are seen to move In unison
with the words of the chaplain, but if ho
is repeating the prayer It la done In a mere
mumble. A good old lady In the gallery
yesterday obeyed the chaplain's lnlunctlon,
and her voice was heard to the uttermost
parts of the chamber. Soon after perform
ing this duty she flaunted out of the gal
lery obviously In a huff.
"I think them old senators ought to be
ashe-med of themselves for not saying the
Lord's prayer with the preacher," she de
clared Indignantly to a doorkeeper. "Maybe
they don't know It, and if they don't their
wives ought to teach it to 'era."
Although Senator Piatt of New York Is
feeble In the extreme and moves about
only with great difficulty, he has savage
aversion to anyone hinting at hi condition.
He tottered out of the senate while the
president's message was being read and
made for a waiting carriage. A stiff breeze
blew his coattalls wildly about hi thin
frame and his thin frame shook like a
reed. A capltol policeman made bold to
take hold of the old man' arm a he tried
to mount the steps of the carriage and as
sist him to enter. Fiercely th New Yorker
turned on th cop. "What are you doing,
sir?" snarled the senator. "Only trying to
help you in your carriage, sir," politely re
plied the bluecoat, with a tremor in his
voice. "Get away from me," snapped Sen
ator Piatt, Imperiously. "I don't need the
help of you nor anybody els to get Into
my carriage." Th policeman scooted back
to hi post.

Bow.n aucceeded Mr. Loo mis a. mlnl.t.r
to that hotbed of intrigue, Vene.uela, and
filed rather grave charge, against him
after Mr. Looml. had been called by th
president from his post a. minister to
Portugal to the first assistant aecretaryshlp
of .tat. in Washington. Investigation of

punished enough for hi attack on Mr.

TATE PRESS COMMENT.
St, Paul Republican: Let it not be for
gotten by embrvo legislators 'that an
amendment to the revenue law which will
authorize assessor to Inspect bank, build
ing and loan and other books of deposit
Is necessary to a fair and equal distribu
tion of the tax burden. 80 long as nun
of clastic conscience have their money
concealed In places where the assessing
officer ar forbidden to search, the as
sumption that everyone must pay taxes
upon a fair valuation of his earthly pos
sessions Is a howling farce.
Grand Island Independent: The locality
from which a United States senator comes
Is not of so much Importance. If he will
honestly endeavor to secure good, whole
some laws for the benefit of all the people
of the nation and act and vote conscienti
ously and honestly and courageously on
measures of great public Interest, he will
most fully succeed In the Important service
for which he Is chosen. Mr. Yelser' ap
parent idea that something Is not right
unless one of the senators from this state
is from Omaha has no good foundation.
Omaha should have Just as fair and good
representation as any other city, no more
and no less. And Senator-elect Brown will
give her that.
Auburn Republican: Colonel W. 8. Til
ton, editor of the Beatrice Times, Is a
candidate for the secretaryship of. the
senate at the coming session. We know of
no gentleman In the state who Is more
eminently qualified to fill that Important
place. Colonel Tllton Is a man of scholarly
attainments, of gentle bearing, courteous
and broad-minded. He la alive to every
responsibility that falls upon him and
would be a most distinguished addition to
the Senate chamber. He Is versatile and
his attainments and knowledge of eco
nomics would be valuable to the workers of
that body. Colonel Tllton is a modest
man. He Is not an office or place seeker
and all his friends in this section should
aid him In his ambition by their friendly
efforts to procure for him an honor which
would be a graceful reward for his life
time of patriotic service.
Fremont Tribune: On his departure for
Washington Senator Millard la quoted by
the World-Herald as being hopeful that
the law of gravitation may be suspended,
that the Platte river wIM commence flow
ing toward Its source, that Omaha may
get the senatorshlp again, and that he may
be It. "I believe," said the senator, "that
there Is a feeling throughout the state
that Omaha should have a senator." We
do not know upon what his declara
tion can be predicated. Perhaps it Is be
cause Omnha has had a senator or two
for fifty years. Or perhap It Is so only
because Omaha has Senator Millard and he
would like It again, neither of which can
be denied. But the state of Nebraska does
not want Omaha to have It again, and cer
tainly not Senator Millard. He had forty
eight votes In the nominating convention
out of a total of Senator Millard al.
says that If Omaha's delegation In the legis
lature will stand by an Omaha man
enough votes will be attracted from other
parts of the state to elect him. Folderol
and fiddlesticks! Omaha's delegation has
decided that It will be folly for It to stand
out against the rest of the state on the
senatorshlp and get paid back in Its own
coin for everything else It wants. Senator
Millard, never a politician, never In touch
with the people, doesn't know a pipe dream
from a mortal cinch. While he Indulges in
the former, Norrls Brown ha the latter.

WE KSKW HIM As A FRIEND.
(Tribute to Judge Bartholomew.)
His noble mien and kindly face
4VIII oft recur to memory;
And friends In each accustomed place
Will miss the heart so warm and free.
And still, In thought, we'll often meet
Him walking with his look benign,
And fift, In memory, warmly greet
With clasp of hand or hailing sign.
Though mortal part have reached th end.
And outward vision is denied;
W say: We knew him as a friend,
And In our hear' he has not died.
