INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY THE ONLY
THING THAT WILL AID THE COUNTRY
EVEN those skeptical persons who do sot believe that
some divinity gives ns trials aad troubles for the
purpose of teaching m moral lesson rsnst admit that we
--ere indeed a foolish people if we did not, nevertheless,
- rof:t by sneh lessons as we are learning is these post
war davs.
Leaving aside for the present the purely moral eteraeats
r.i our present national experience, the economic lessons
o be learned come under three general Beads. These are
The necessity of greater production, the necessity of more
eihcient production and the aceetstty of eoBservaooB.
By increased srodactiea more is meant than the mere
growing of vegetables. As K. at Roberts, of the chamber
or commerce, pot it in an Interview rate exner aay, -raxm-ng
means more than the growing of grain. There are
.armers of the forest and the sea at well, and misers are
farmers in the broader sense-" So many persons live in
he cities and so many live by gambling in commodities
and by work allied with distxrbatiea that the tost of all
necessaries produced as the result of the competition of
markets tor tne protracts is one or an proportion 10 mc
-refit derived by the producer or the normal vatee of the
products to the consumer.
If there were some scientific meant of diverting from
non-prodnctive activity ranch of the energy engaged in it,
io actual productivity it would art down the number of
profits taken between predacer and consumer without ma
terial v lessening the profit taken at the source of prodnc
t:on and would have the advantage of decreasing subs tan
; ally the cost to the consamer. Of coarse the benefits of
uch a diversion of energy into prod active channels by
means of increasing the naxnber of mdiridaals engaged in
production would be offset if the number of hoars each
individual devoted to prodactive work daily should con
tinue to decrease in accord with the demands of organised
worker todaV-
The second step toward economic recovery consists in
increasing the amount and quail ly ot wnac is proonceu m
' a given time. It has been argaed that if these two steps
vrere carried out our markets would be gritted with prod
ucts which would result in a cheapening of both the product
and the labor used in producing it. If the advice were
,-niiowri nnr the entire earth there might be some ex
case for the argument. Common sense tells ns nothing
like this will ever be done over the whole world. Smce
this is true America has everything to gain and nothing
to lose by it
Smerire li the world for a market. All of the sur
plus above our own needs we can produce for the next 30
years will be bought from a by Europe alone. As it is,
with no surplus of our own, Europe is drawing on ear re
serve supply. Sugar is a notable instance of this. Eng
land is taking from our rerraeries su oc si,u
needs while we are threatened with a famine in sweets.
It is, then, not only wise for as to increase production now
that we may supply the world out of a surplus, but that
when the day comes that Earope is completely recuper
ated and offering her products for sale we may have the
advantage of being awe to ma ice oenvciy uc u,.,
and to deliver a better quality of goods.
Conservation can hardly be discussed as an economic
necessity without also referring to its moral aspects, we
have become a nation ef wasters. Prodigality as a na
tional vice is greater than our greed. American people are
not greedy for gain that they may hoard it, bat that they
may spend it It is notable that the American always
raises his standard of living when his income is increased.
There is nothing miserly about him, The tendency of the
American to waste does no injury when times are right
It is when times Kke these come around that the tendency
to waste reacts disastrously because national habits can't
be changed abruptly to meet the emergency.

The West And The Presidency.

A LOT of old traditions are doomed. One of them is that
presidents must come from the east. The next presi
dent may cot be a westerner, but some day the United
States will look occasionally to the country west of the
Mississippi for its chief executive.
Why shouldn't we start now to boom our favorite sons'
for the highest job within the gift ef the nation? The
west feeds the east and it it universally known that the
pep and brains of the east were acquired in the west. The
only reason the west has not sent a president ts Wash
ington before is that the opinion has prevailed that a rsan
to make a safe and sane president must have bees
schooled in the atmosphere ef eastern counting bosses.
Truth is, Americanism is to be found in its purest form in
the wide expanses ef the free west
After all it means less to the west to have a president
who is a Republican or a Democrat than it- does to have a
man who is in sympathy with our needs and desires. There
is, for instance, Hiram Johnson, of California. Hiram woaU
see to it that some of the mosey congress is accustomed to
throwing around more or less loosely in its appropriations
came out west for reclamation purposes and for other agri
cultural development Hiram would do more for Demo
cratic Texas than any Democrat east of the Mississippi
river would ever think of doing.
There is George Chamberlain, ef the state of Oregon.
George is a Democrat Bat he was three times elected gov
ernor of the most dyeo-in-the-wooi KepuMKan state in
the west and be was elected when the state gave a plu
rality to Hughes, Republican candidate for president Demo
crat that he is, he wosm oo more tor Kepuoncan new Mex
ico than any RepabHcan Massachusetts could produce in
50 years.
When the national conventions begin to consider norai
nations the west should demand that it get a consideration
which, except in the case of Bryan, has never before been
given to rt
We should not knock an occasional "norther" sort
should be thankful that 1 Paso has mere nice weather
than moat any other town in the country.
That English chemist may have discovered a way

President Wilson has said "nothing doing," so the spe

court's injunction. So why delay the trial?

SCTKRSTITIO.NS ABOUT l'RESIDF-NTIAL ELECTION!,
PRIOR to the reelection of Gen.
Grant in 1872 there wu a super
stition prevalent that do man pos
sessed of a middle name conld be
elected president a second term. The
notion was based upon the fact that
every president so endowed up to that
time had. for one reason or another,
failed to be reelected. Ever since
Grant, this superstition has held good.
Including Grover Cleveland, who. it
188, but his term was not to beje'n
until the day he took the oath for
president-. So it et remains for sotn
bold man in th senate to prove th-a
superstition unfounded.
It has b-en unusual for tne -"ic
president to succeed to the first pla
m the government. After Adams an 1
Je t f erson. no vice president wa -
elected until Van Bnren broke tin
rule, and then there was none a.gzm
until Roosevelt.

There is another superstition, still
more commonly held, that no senator
can be elected president. Jackson
was a senator when defeated In 124:
Clay when defeated In 1812. Gar
field had been chosen senator from
Ohio when nominated for president in
believe. His reasons were rurelv
personal. He had onicinally accept e-t
the office with relucanoe. was tired
of honors, had reached the age when
he felt the need of rest from put.ll -life,
had become a taryet for vitupe -ative
assaults, and believed he should

On the contrary. It is doubtful it
he had ever heard . of deductive
ratiocination, and he shocked the
French and therefore uncompromis
ingly logical xalnd of his chief, Henri
DncastaL bv succeeding In spite of
his methods, which were unorthodox
negligent, cavalierly quite South
Carolinian, in xact.
For be calmlr passed over moat

who was big enough would either
himself eradicate all treacherous
clews or plant wrong clews on pur
pose to deceive the police, white u
the criminal did not have enough
sense to go through and act accord
ing to such reasoning, be, Tennant,
for one had no intention of getting
mixed up with the case. He preferred
worth while game.
So he usually proceeded in his in
vestigations by methods which Henri
Ducastel called slipshod which he
himself pronounced to be applied
psychology, and which might, with
equal truth, be styled applied poetry.
For he progressed by sodden leaps
of his invagination, by sudden grasp
lngs at situations and entangle
ments. Occasionally he loft Iooee ends
which he picked up and tied into
nooses aiangmen s nooses, fre
quently. He did this whenever he
had a chance, and forgot ail about
it when the chance did not arise. He
was really too clever a man to be
afraid of inconslsten6ies.
Today, with the library door closed
behind him and the angry mutterings 1
of the apaches at the openings of
the Rue Ferou drifting in like the
humming of bees, he moved swiftly
through the apartment aa was his
wont, while Ducastel looked on the
mixture of admiration and disap
proval. The tatter's active years
were over. But he was still the bead
of the great Agence Ducastel. and.
old man though he was. he liked to
be present when a mystery was being
solved. it was meat and drink to
him.
The American walked straight over
to wnere tne oeao man was slouched
in a leather backed armchair, his
back to the window, facing the broad,
massive writing table of carved oak.
wnen Lwcastel stopped him.
"Aren't you xrolnsr to have a look
at the doors and windows first 7 He
knew the answer he would receive,
but his logical Latin mind insisted on
tne question and the Implied protest.
"No. Why should IT'
"But my friend r Ducastel clutched
his neat, grap beard with a gesture
of despair. "You are a special in
vestigator. I pay you a salary worthy
of the purse of Fortunatusr
"Don't I earn it?" came the calm
query, and then the reply:
"Ye. Of course, my boy. But yon
should ascertain how the assassin got
into the room, and how he left!"
Tennant lifted a corner of the
white cloth which covered the face of
the dead ma He said It made no
difference to him how the murderer
got In nor how he got oat. The man
had come In somehow and got out
somehow. That was all there was
to it.
"But but " the other stammered,
then whispered the potent shibboleth
of his craft:
"Finger prints, Tennant! Finger
prints!"
He pronounced the word with a
sibilant, dramatic hiss, but Tennant
was ununpreswsd.
"Why look for flnsrer prints." he
asked, "since the police have already
arrested Mile. Lantalgne as the
culprit.
"The police have been at work less
than an hour. The murder was com
mitted a little before six. There was
an unturned dock, which stopped
clicking, also the testimony of Ana-
tole Jarvet s aousekeeper. ne sam
that"
"Never mind Just now what she
said. What about the police and the
finger prints?
"The case against mademoiselle is
not vet perfect. The police have found
certain evidence. But they found no
finger prints. They thought tnats
where you would help"
"Not I!" Tennant shook his head.
"All the finger prints I want are
those of the fellow who gave that
last yell Just before we came in here,
Dwon with the army!"
"What's he cot to do with It? There
you go off on one of your usual
tangents?" Ducastel repeated, ex
citedly:
TF the unions of El Paso think th
m American legion is fighting them.
let them send representatives to oar
next meeting and make a formal com
plaint to us and state on what
grounds they base their charge,"
This was the invitation issued
organised labor Tuesday by Rer. F. St
Johnson, jr., when he was informed
that union officials were accusing
him of sending workers to jobs at
wages lower than the union trade.
"We are finding Jobs for returned
men as fast as we can," said Mr.
Johnson. "Naturally we try to get as
big a wage as we can for each former
Msrvice man who goes to work. We
don't know what the union scale is
and have no way of knowing unless
the unions file a schedule of wages
with ns."
"Some interesting data coneerninc

cently has reached the public," said
J. B. King. "Tbfe data shows that
the salaries are insufficient m mMt

data obtained indiscriminately among

port i or a year, mis proved the con
tention. His salary and allowances
made his income $3100 a year. His
expense account showed an expendi
ture of more than 13700. This man
explained that he had no other source
of income than the army, and had
given up a good medical practice to
take a commission. He was just $5vt
worse off than when he entered the
service. Another officer showed a
balance of $12.30 cash on hand when
his year's financial report was done.
Bach case was given strict attention
to detect expenditures which were
not warranted. In each case It was
found that the men lived far more
economically than In civilian life. In
some cases the examining board mem
bers were astounded to know what
could be done on so little money."
