Washington. l>ec. 7. ? President-elect
Harding's show of independence tn his
farewell speech at the senate is the
talk of the national capital. It wasn't
so much the impressive way by which
the departing senator appealed to his
col. i* u?s for cooperation but the vry
clear-cut emphasis which lie placed upon
the powers of the executive that caught
the ear of political Washington anil
promptly set everybody gossiping as to
the true meaning of the informal Utter
ance.
It is a fact, for instance, that when
Mr. Harding arrived he re Sunday night,
indeed, w hen he met some of his col
leagues early Monday they were almost
unanimously against the idea of h'.s
making a speech at all. Some suggested
that It ' would be indelicate for him to
address the senate in h'.s present por
tion. Hut Warn n Harding showed that
he has a mind ftf his own. Ho determin
ed t<> 'make the speech becausc he had
something very d?4inlte to say, some
thing that couldn't very well be said if
were already President and had to ad->
dress the senate on offletal business, i
He wanted the men in the senate -O
know that he intended to be as insistent
upon the powers of the executive as ho
had been on the powers of a senator. He
gave a gentle warning that anything;
like a '?senatorial oligarchy" wouldn't
tx> tolerated. He referred more or less
humorously to t>?>v?rnor t 'ox's phrase
"a senate ol!garch>" ? but the significant
thing is that he saw lit to bring the
phrase back into this particular speech
at at I. Those who know Mr. Harding s
mind say he wanted to take occasion
to appeal to his friends not to presume
too much, not to make his task hard j
simply because he had grown so Inti*
mate with his colleagues in the senato. ;
Moreover, he wanted to remove any sug
gestion that the senate would control
the next administration n.s has been so
annoylngly suggested from time to t'n?1'
not by Democrats alone but by leading
Republicans tn the senate with whom
the wish Is father to the thought.
C?bla.*t OtmUOa.
To be sure Mr Harding has found out I
one thing already during his brier vis t ,
to Washington, namely. that the most,
Insistent demands for representation in
the cabinet either for themselves or
their friends has come from coMeagues
in the I'nited States senate. This has
led to very well defined counter-move
ments? one on the part of some lo>al
comrades who really think they aTe of;
the greater assistance to Mr. Harding
by their effort to keep anybody in tb?
jtaruito from into th?> cubsnet anJ* 1
another k'roup wno realty wants to n
a good deal to say In the next admlnls-|
tratlon and thinks the best way to ae- ,
compllsh it is by retaining in the senate
att the strong men and making the capi
tol the same center of gravity that it
was in the days of Aldrlch and Cannon,
when to know what the administration
going to do newspaper men ilocKea
to the senate or to the house Instead of j
White House.
Then again there Is another campaign
being waged with'all the subtlety that
politicians can command. They have
obligations of their own to fulfill. They
want to see a particular friend in the
cahinnt but the position for which the
latter P"V> be fitted i* be in* ??u*fct by i
somebody in the senate or else there 1* '
% conflict on the subject of geographical
selection for it is not customary to taK*
more than one cabinet member from any
one state. So the process of killing
off the other fellow" Is now in full
swing. _ ... .
Throughout It all. Warren Harding
remains shrewdly non-committal, listen
ing attentively, even good-humoredly to
<omo of the awkward attempts to gain
his ear. But the very definite impression
;s left by President-elect Harding as he
xoes to Marion that nobody has a cabl
net portfolio cine' d. Mr. Harding is
slow to make up his mind about any
thing. He Is a deliberate type
doesn't h??itate to change his mind
when It Is once made up. In that very
psychology lies the best chance for
Elihu Hoot to bo a leading adviser In the
next administration. Were the choice
to be made today. Mr. Root wouldnt
have a chance. But Mr. Harding has
vet to hoar from the who.e country. He
has yet to learn what all Republicans
think about all questions. He has .been
away from the country for a month.

ters" of friends In all .sections of Ameri
ca. The public opinion of the nation

the faith of th# friends of Mr. Root.
Already theTe are suggestions from
Harding men who have not ben part. cu
larly frlndly to Mr. Root that there are
things bigger than the secretaryship
of state, namely, the commission tha.
goes abroad to negotiate a revision of
the peace treaty or the establishment of
a new association or league of nation^
and that on such a commission Mr. Root
would b-> a logical chairman However,
the public can only be tol<> thus far

SERVICEABLE ACTS
OF LEGISLATURE
In the Present National Stress
Recommended By Na
tion's Executive
The text of President Wilson's j
mcHsnKi' to Congress. transmitted
Tuesday. appears on page eight
of today's Intelligencer.
Washington, Dec. 7. ? Both houses of
congress were in brief session today to !
hear rmddent Wilson's annual message. '
It was read by the cl>?rk, Mr. Wilson hav- 1
ing hoodeil the advice of his physicians |
not to appear In person to present his .
recommendations.
Oalleries on both senate and house ?
woro crowded, hut thoso drawn by the
chance that the president might appear
? it person < r bv the possibility that his
message might touch upon the Jx-ague
of Nations question or his own ap-l
preaching retirement to private life
woro disappointed.
Mr. Wilson confined himself almost J
wholly to domestic questions. Only by |
inference did his message refer to the .
muring c.loso of his administration nnd I
that was In the concluding paragraph. ?
The proposals he presented, the prest- j
dent wri?te. wore not so much a series .
of recomniendatolns as a confession "of i
the faith In which I was bred and which
it is my solemn purpose to stand by
until my last fighting day."
Definite Progress
Aside from hearing the president's an
nual 'message, congress made definite J
proKToss on at lea.st ono of the problems
it faces during the briof session. Tho
house received a rule under which an
effort will be made Thursday to take up
thi.- immigration bill for prompt action. ?
It would limit Ron eral debato to four '
hours. ? Tho two day Interval was at- j
l??w?d to permit Representative Sogol. of i
N?w York, a member of the Immigration i
committee to frame a minority re- port.
No other matter In either hou*e had i
posted today beyond tho committee ;
stage. At both ends of the capital, how- j
ever, members were deep in plans to
deal with business depression, imem
ployment and farmers. TUseussions in ?
tlii- senate ?>f the plight of farmers de
layod the reading of the president's mes- j
sago in that body.
Prod-am of X>?flalAtlon
The Industrial situation also found a '
?place in the president's message, lto- 1
covery from war effects gave promise of ?
early completion "only in our own for
tunate country," Mr. Wilson said, and ;
even hero "halts and Is impeded at .
times."
A program of "immediately service-'
able acts of legislation." to aid that re- i
covery "and prove the indestructible re
cuikt.iUvi' force of a great government
of the people" should be undertaken, Mr.
Wilson said, adding:
"One of these is to prove that a great
democracy can keep house as succss fully
and In as buslness-lik fashion as any:
other government."
Kirwt among tho recommended steps
Mr. Wilson placed enactment of a !
"workable budget system." He said he
had vetoed the budget bill passed at the i
last session "reluctantly" and because of
"a constitutional objection," but as ll ?
was later revised in the house, he be- j
lleved it would, with other measures, fur
nish "foundations for a national budget j
system." ,
Economy Urged
Mr. Wilson cited figures as to tho
national debt and urged "rigid economy" .
in which all branches of the government
should co-operate.
"I cannot ever-empliasize," lie said,
"tho necessity of economy In govern
ment appropriations and expenditures
and the avoidance' by congress of prac
tices which take money from the treas
ury by indefinite or revolving fund ap
propriations."
This year's estimates "strikingly" il
lustrated the importance of specific ap
propriations, the president added, the
transportation act having "disturbed"
the relationship between current re
ceipts and expenditures to the extent of
over a billion ddlars. "It is obvious,"
the nv?.?age continued, "t)u?t the-se large
payments have alroady seriously limited
tho government's progress In retiring
the floating debt."
The president renewed some #f the
recommendations he made at the open- ;
lng of the la.st session, and added:
"I do not feel It my privilege at j>r>?s- !
ent to suggest! the detailed and pertieu- ;
lar methods by which these objects may
bo attained, but I have faith that the I
Inquiries of your several committee* I
will discover the way and the method." |
The only recommendations for other j
than domestic matters was that for a '
loan to Armenia to be administered j
through American commissioners to '
avoid "further tempting opportunities to
revolutionary tendencies in that coun- j
try" and for granting independent to :
the Philippines, to '"keep our promise |
to the people of those islands."

[economics of the l.eague of Nations as

i no member of the league shall be per
i nutted to blockade an offending mem
ber without t}ie consent of the council
of the League of Nations, but that it
'may reject t h ?? decisions of the council
' if it believes it to be unjust. This ac
tion came at the close of a three hour
debate .at a public session of the com
| mission which deveio;>ed two definite
| divisions of opinion among the states.
one group, led by Stgnor Sehanzer, of
J the Italian delegation. took the view
' that it would he fatal If each power
: were permitted to commence a blockade,
(whenever it considered its course right
. and without a decision by the council.
| The other group, the spokesman of
! which was Halmar Brantlng, of Swe
; den, who Is chairman of the commission
' on disarmament, blockade.^ and man
? dates, opposed placing the decision in
the hands of the council.
"My country wijl never yiefd to the
council the right to decide when a
blockade shall be instituted," M. Grant

'Africa, suggested a compromise, permit

council if the states thought the decis

Howel and Francis Hatch. Willers was
then taken to Governor's Island, head
quarters of the Second army corps, and
placed in confinement at Fort Jay.
His Chan co Didn't Com?.
Willers. the police said, recited in a.
brazen fashion how he was sent to the
United States as one of three hundred '
cadets trained in the acts of espionage,'
to enlist in the American army.
On his arrival in the United States,
Willers went to Albany, where he en
listed. h>- said, as a private. Hjs mili
tary aptitude won him rapid promotion
and his knowledge of Knglish anil lus
ability tu ?"speak like an American" en
abled him to obtain a commission.
Willers said he had never been sent ,
across the ocean, and while m thisj
country, his instructions were "to act
the part of a loyal American" and to!
fake no action until he reached the war
zone.
"What was your plan sifter reaching'

that they would be surprised If they
knew "the number of officials at Wash-'
ington duritiK the war who were em
ployed by Germany as spies."
"Are they still there?" he was asked.
"That I don't know." lie is said to
have answered, "hut there were many,
of them during the war."
The Forty-eighth infantry was still 1
at Camp Sevier when the armistice was
signed and. his usefulness as n spy at.

elded to become a deserter ana to take, ?
they alleged, the finds of his company!
The deserter then went to Chicago '
where about a year ago he married a
yrung American woman named Craw-,
ford.
From Chicago, Willers roamed about .
the country, at various times in his
travels trying unsuccessfully to jjet a
passport to Germany. He disguised
himself and waited an opportunity to
quit the country. A pair or heavy eye- '
Klasses. he said, was an Important part'
of his disguise.
When questioned by military authori
ties at Governor's Island, Willers de
clined t . ? amplify his alleged confession!
to the police. J
