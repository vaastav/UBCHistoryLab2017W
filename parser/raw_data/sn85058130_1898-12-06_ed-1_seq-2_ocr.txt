teer In service beyond the time of
signing the peace treaty saying
There Is no war In existence and
none Is imminent The law requires
one or two other conditions and the
threat of the president to hold the vol
unteer In service until the standing
army Is increased beyond what the
consciences of senators and members
dictate looks to me like a menace and
an effort to dictate which I consider
an outrage and unpardonable
Senator Jones interpreted the presi
dents expression upon the finances as
a pronouncement for the gold standard
and for the retirement of the green
backs and said that he did not believe
that anything like a majority of the
American people would endorse him In
this respect The senator also an
flounced himself as opposed to a sub
I sidy to vessels connecting the United
States with Puerto Rico Cuba and the
Philippines a opposed to legislation
I for the construction of the Nicaragua
canal as at present contemplated and
expressed the opinion that the presi
dent had inclined to go farther In the
matter of the government of Cuba than
for the resolulon of intervention called
forWe
We declared he sad in favor of
taking them to that point by which
they cold maintain a stable govern
ment and I do not see how we can go
beyond that
To go to the extent of insuring as
the president recommends complete
tranquility might prove a pretext for
a military government and permanent
occupation never to be ended I do
not endorse any such an understand
ing Senator Jones also expressed sur
prise with the absence of anY recom
mendaton concerning the Philippines
The question of the goverment of
the Philippines is attracting much at
tention he sad and the fact that
the president utterly ignores it strikes
me as very singular
Senator Pascoe also commented upon
the absence of any reference to points
concerning which we most desire In
formation He said however that
it was a valuable historical paper and
would be convenient for future refer
ence
TELLERS VIEWS
Senator Teller said there would be
disappointment over the failure of the
president to outline a government for
te Philippines saying
There will be some disappointment
in this for I think the uderstadlnl
ha been that the president would in
dicate what for of government should
be provided for these new possessions
but I Is wise for the president not to
Indicate his views on that subject for
that is purely and properly a legislative
question and one that should be left I
to congress I
On the recommendation in regard to
currency Senator Teller said The
friends of bimetalsm either national
or international will find no en
couragement from anything that the
president says In his message No
reference Is made to Interndtonal bi
metalsm but the president in the
most emphatic way Indicates his In
tention to maintain the gOld standard
The socaled silver Republicans who
remain In the Republican party and
contend that the Republican party Is
friendly to silver will find no en
couragement In the presidents mes
sage and It will strike all as some
what singular that i thc Republican
party as It ha been claimed I in
favor of international bimetalsm the
president makes no reference to i
Following are some of the opinions
pressed by members of congress
upon the presidents message
PRAISED BY HITT
Representative Hit chairman of
said the house committee on foreign affairs
saidThe
The president has summarized md
solved In an able and felicitous manner
many of the questions in mens minds
everywhere touching the immense and
I rapidly succeeding events ad the
situation In which the nation fInds
itself His simple proposition to let the
new possessions alone under just and
firm governor and by the military
arm which conquered them gives us
time for plenty of discussion of all the
propositions for their permanent gov
ernment The problem of governing
the Cubans he deals with gently and
hopefully and everybody will wish
that his forecast of stable government
there will be realized sooner than ever
yet has happened to a SpanishAmer
can population
Represenatve ralker chairman of
the committee on banking and cur
rencyI am asked what I think of the
currency and banking feature I do
not see that I ha any such features
I have not been able to detect any It
contains only one recommendation to
the currency repeating that of a for
mer message to change the United
State legal tender notes Into gold cer
tificates which would have no effect
on the banking and currency situation
but to add to the burden of taxation
without In any degree favorably affect
Ing the general banking and currency
situation
SOUNDMONEY MESSAGE
Mr Grosvenor of OhioThe message
Is not one of beaten paths I is not
encumbered with platitudes and Is
writen In a very attractive style The
contribution to history In the elaborate
recitation of the events of the war are
In good taste and devoid of boasting
and vanity The comment upon inci
dents of the war and the valor of our
mennaval and mitaryand the tIne
work of all our seamen and artfcers
will be found fully justified by the
facts The view or the president upon
the question of currency reform will
meet the intelligent sanction of sound
money men of all parties The message
on the whole is able and eminently sat
isfactory

la The conclusion in which nothing
Is conclude
NOTHING NEW
Representative Band of 1issourl
The message so far a the currency
question Is concerned is very brief
and contains nothing new and nothing
beyond former recommendations I
might remark that on the great leading
Issuewhich Is and will be the para
mount quetonthe free coinage of elI
ver the message Is ominously silent
bt no proposition on the money ques
tion can be considered without at the
same time considering this question

Mr Richardson em of Tennessee
The president makes interest
i a most interet
Ingand satsfcofy re1e Of the
Spanish war but it is disappointing
that he fails to tel u s what na ae to
do with the new possessions I Is just
a approprate now as it will be after
the treaty of peace for him to tel us
what is to be tH future of th new
terrItory I might jieip get the treaty
ratified If he had solved the probler
I Is interesting to note the fact that
threfourths of the message relates to
foreign affairs tInd less than one
fourth to home matters Banking and
currency and aU financial reform legis

LONDON DISAPPOINTED
Comniendation and Criticism Prom
the English Press
London Dee 6Much havIng been
expected there Is a certain tone of dis
appointment In the morning paper edit
orials on President McKlnleys mes
sage Its noncommittal character Is
attribute to the fact that the negotia
tions of the peace commissioners at
Pars are not finished
Considerable satisfaction is expressed
at the references to AngloAmerican re
lations and at the coldness displayed
toward Russia
The Daily News complains of the
ambiguity of the message on commer
cial and currency maters and the
conspicuous absence of any allusion to
free trade
The Times says I Is creditable to
both the dignity and good Mnse of the
America people that a message an
nouncing the vIctorious ending of the
great war the acquisition of territory
and the initiation of an imperialist
policy Is sober in tone and moderate In
recommendations The war ha finally
healed the hal closed wounds left by
the titanic contests of the secession
and we hope It ha exercised a healing
influence to be felt even more wIdely
and deeply In another direction Not
sInce England recognized the United
States government power has an Amer
ican president alluded to the mother
country in language so cordial and
friendly a Mr McKinleys

the details and referring to British
rights In Nicaragua under the Clayton
Bulwer treaty the Times says I the
freedom of the waterway Is secured to
the ships of all nations we shall not
need to stand strictly upon clams
whIch originated when the circum
stances were altogether different
The Daily Chronicle also pays a
tribute to the sober sound common
sense and straightforward language of
the message pointing out that Presl
dent McKlnleys reference to the mU
try occupaton of Cuba virtually out
lines a policy precisely the same as I
Great Britain I Egypt and likely to
have the same effect

The editorial highly approves Mr
McKlnleys references to China and
Great Brian
The Standard says Few could have
foretold that the war would work so
rapid and drastIc a change How ab
solute the metamorphosis is may best
be gathered from a comparison with
previous messages I is not rah to
predict that the Unlted States will ad
vance In thepat1upon which their feet
are firmly set
The Standardconstrues Mr lfcKln
leys references to China as a declar
ton that had the open door been closed
01 obstructed America would have In

For all purppses of British policy
no intimation could be more welcome
than that the United States will aD

The Daily Telegraph which r Jards

With such common interests to unite

The Daily 1Ialsays We are disap
pointed and surprised at this attempt
to set aside the ClnytonBulwer treaty
especially In view of the AngloAerI

The Morning Post on the other hand
says Circumstances have changed

institution called the Robert cole e
They have never from that day to this

identifying themselves with any sect

that every student within their walls
shall be thoroughly trained on the
AmerIcan principles which since they
were Imported by the men of the May

but they have trained and sent out
into the world thousands of bright
brainy young fellows who have car
ried the leaven of the American town
meeting Into all the provIDces of the
Ottoman empire
Robert college men are turning up
everywhere If the good work goes On
the alumni of this American institution
will be able to supply the personnel of
the civilized administration which must
some day supercede the barbarIc horror
that is at present misnamed the gov
ernment or Turkey
LIBERATED BULGARIA
The one great thing done in the
making of states in the last quarter of
the century was the creation of the
Bulgarian principality But he Bul
garlan principality the resurrection of
the Bulgarian nationality although
materially achieved by the sword of
the liberating and avengmng hordes of
Russia was due primarily to the Rob
ert college I was the Americans who
sowed the seed I was the men of
Robert college who took Into BUlgaria
the glad news of a good time coming
when Bulgaria would be free When
the Turks scared by the propaganda
or liberty descended In savage wrath
upon the helpless people with sword
and fame and worse than bestial lusts
to eradlcpte the newborn national as
pirations It was the AmerIcans who
brought the whole horrible truth to
the light of day 1Ir Disraeli then
premier of England led about it In his
place In parliament not even scrupling
to falsify dispatches and betray the
confidence of his country in order to
shield the Turk All was in vain Rob
ert college men were on the spot Their
chief was In constant communication
with the ambassador and journalists
of Constantinople They found in 1Ir
Pears an English barrister of high
standing a correspondent of the Daily
News a man fearless and capable
enough to stand the brunt of making
the awful exposure What followed is
a mater of history The revelation of
the truth about thd Bulganlan massa
cres shattered as bY dynamite the tra
ditonal policy of England 1Ir Glad
stone sprang Into the field The Rus
sian people moved to Its depth by the
stories of the sufferings their breth
ren could not be restrain The czar
liberator carried the Russian arms in
triumph to the very gates of Staboul
Nor did they return till by the treaty
of San Stefano they had created that
Bulgarian principality which had been
dreamed out on the astral plane by
the students of the American college
RUSSIANS cEERED
When the Russian army of hibera
ton returned home after the peace was
signed they passed down the Dos
phorus and a each huge transport
crowded with the warworn veterans of
the Balkan battlefields steamed pst
the picturesque rg of Roumelsusal
on which the Rober college sis en
throned they one and all did homage
to the Institution which had made Bul
garia possible by cheering lusty and
causing the military bands to play
American airs I was the tribute of
the arifcer in blood and iron to the
architects on whose designs they had
bulded the Bulgarian state
But the innuence of the America
college did not stop there When the
constitutional assembly met at Tier
nova to frame the constitution for the
new born state It was a Robert col
lege graduate who succeeded in giving
the new constitution its extreme
democratic character and when after
the Russians left the Bulgarians be
gan to do their own governing it was
again the American trained men who
displayed the spirit of Independence
which baffled and angered the Russian
generals From that time to this day
when one Robert college man Is prime
minister of Bulgaria and another Is
Bulgarian minister at Constantnople
while a third one of the ablest of them
Is BulgarIan minister at 4thens the
Robert college has been a nursery fdr
Bulgarian statesmen So marked In
ded has been the influence of this one
institution that there are some who
say that of aU the results of the
Crimean war nothing was of such
permanent Importance as the fact that
attracted to Clnstantnople a plan
American citizen from New York
OHE INSTITUTIONS
The influence of the United States
in the east is by no means confined to
Robert colee There are other institutions
tutons founded by Americans at Con
stantinople which are working quite
as well as the Robert college but as
they educate girls Instead of boys they
wl not make their political influence
felt until the sons of Ute students come I
to mans estate But It is not only ft i
Constantinople are at work They are
at the present moment almost the OnlY
people who are doing any good for hu
manity In Asiatic Turkey The Ger
man kaiser has fraternized with the
assassin and arm ai arm with the I
infidel has proclaimed his divine mis I
slon to protect the Christians of the I
cast whom his rend and host has
been massacrelng by thouands for the
last four ear But the onlY protec
tion the poor unfortunates receive Is
from Englshspeaing men I grieve
to say it but j is for the most part
quie true that until the other day
England did no good to anyone In
Asia minor Of late the English pe
pIe have wakened up and are now
spending thousands of pounds In char
ity In that country But the only real
good which the English did In these
regions for many ear was confined
to this l Our British consuls helped
get enheU
I the American missionaries 1 when they
got Into difficulties People speak as
I the AngloAmercan alliance was a
peaceful dream to be realized In the
remote future I they had lived In
Asia Minor they would discover that
It Is a very practical working factor
In the daily lfe of millions of men
How may American citizens I won
der are aware that from the slopes of
Mount Arrrat all the way to the
shores of the blue Aegean sea American
missionarIes have scattered broadcast
over all the distressful land the seed of
AmerIcan principles
RUSSIANS ARE UNEASY
The Russians know it and regard the
regd
fact with anything but complacency
When Genera louselof the director
of the foreign faiths within the Rus
sian empire visited Etchmladzln on
the confines of Turkish Armenia the
Armenia patriarch pread before him
a map of Asia Minor which was
marked all over with American col
leges American churches American
schools and American missions They
arc busy everywhere teaching preach
leg begetting new life In these Asiatic
races No one hears of them They
eschew politics They stick to their
Bible and their spelling books but
ever year a increasing number of
Armenians and other orentas issue
from the American schools familiar
with the prIncIples of the declaration
of independence and the fundamental
doctrines of the American constitution
And so the leaven is spreading through
out the whole land
Of course such heavy new wine can
not be poured into the very old bottles
of Turkish provinces without making
ih l
itself felt The Aremnians a vain and
clever race soon became swellheaded
What Burgarians had done they
thought Aremenians could do As the
Robert college had created a Inde
pendent Bulgaria they In turn would
show that they could create an Inde
pendent Aremnla So they set to work
but alas although they did their par
of the work bravely enough Russia this
time was In no mood to come to their
rescue So the sultan fell upon them in
his wrath and aelvcred them over to
the Bahl Bazouk and Kurds What
followed is written In letters of blood
and fire across the recent history of the
east
eatBut
But the end is not yet The American
missionaries who took no part In the
abortive insurrection were par a a Whole
much molested The yare working on
teaching preaching sOwIng the seed day
by day creating the forces which will in
time overturn the Turkish empIre and
regenerate the eat
But the American missionaries have
not come off Scott free Oscar Straus
the United States minister has to collect

some 100 due as compensation far the
destruction of American property durIng
the recent troubles The money 1s yet to
be paid I cost the sultan 00 to
entertain his friend the kaiser How can
lent he spare AmerIcan 100000 to compensate the pest
I shall never forget the Intense con
viction with which a fanatical friend of
the sultan once declared to me that there
would never be a solution of the eastern
question until an American missionary
was impaled and his wife and dauhters
werq flung into the pashas harem He
spoke more truly than he knew Because
within one month of such

coming known to the American people the
warships which swept the fleets of Spain

a contingency happening any day lies the

The Two Gambled In Stocks and thu
Bank Lost 1O7O0OCharged That
Senator KenneyWas Permitted to
Overdraw His Account to Previd
Funds or Speculation
+
Wilmington Del Dee LUniteil
States Senator Richard G Kenney of
Delaware was today placed on trial In
the United States circuit court for the
second time on the charges growing out
of the looting of the First National
bank of Dover by its telIer Wlllianz
R Bogus Kenney was last arraigned
on the charge of aiding and abetting
Boggs in misapplying the banks funds
in last July and after a trIal lasting
over one week the jury disagreed
Since then the charge of conspiracy
has been joined to the first charge
The discovery of a shortage in the
bank came in May 1897 when Tellec
Bogge suddenly left Dover The bank
was found to have been looted in the
sum of 107000 President RIchardson
of the bank came to the rescue and
saved the Institution from failure
Beggs subsequently gave himself up
and admitted his defalcation at the
same time making statements which led
to the arest of Senator Kenney and
several other citizens of Dover Two of
the latter havebeen convicted and are
now serving terms in the Trenton peal
tentiary Boggs pleaded guilty and is
awaiting sentence
The evidence against Senator Kenney
deals largely with numerous stock
transactions in which he and Bogga
were interested
During his last trial Senator Kenne
was represented by Senator Gray his
colleague in the senate and Levi C
Bird Senator Gray Is now In Paris
with the peace commission and en
Attorney John Biggs is assisting Mr
Bird
District Attorney Vandergnift repre
cents the government in the prosecu
lionCourt
Court did not open until nearly noon
and then took a recess until 230 p m
when the examination of witnesses be
gas before a courtroom that was
crowded to the doors
In his opening address to the jury
District Attorney Vandegnift said he
would be able to prove that Senator
Kenney drew money from the bank to
which he was not entitled and used it
to tide over difficulties brought upoa
him by stock speculations He said
that by an arangement with Boggs
Senator Kenney drew money from the
bank when he had no funds there
Boggs making the defendants account
balance by the use of other money in
the bank or in some instances by
withholding the senators checks until
he had made good the deficit
H A Richardson president of the
bank testified to Boggs connection
with the institution and said that it
came to the attention of the directors
in August 1893 that Boggs had been
gambling He confessed his fault and
was forgiven Witness had no further
reason to suspect Boggs until after his
flight In May 1SSS Mr Richardson
said the defalcation was 107000 and
that the bank was able to continue by
himself and others guaranteeing the
stockholders from any loss and reduc
ing the capital stock from 100000 to
50000
A cause of delay and argument at
tile former trial was avoided today by
the admission of numerous checks
drawn by Senator Kenney to the order
of a number of persons and paid by I
the First National bank These coy
ered the period from May to September
1896 and aggregated nearly 9000 Of
this amount 5368 represented the
stock dealings with E B Cuthbert
Co of Philadelphia It was admitted
that Senator Kenney signed checks for
4200 of the amount represented in
stock transactions for Boggs benefit
The remainder represented his own
dealings
Numerous telegrams between Senator
Kenney and Cuthbert Co were also
admitted These represented calls for
further payment on stock and dealings
In regard to the stock but none of the
telegrams were read to the jury
Court then adjourned until tomorrow
SPANIARDS DEAD BROKE
Captain General Raided a Bank But
Got Nothing
New York Dec 5A dispatch to the
Tribune from Havana says The
straits of the Spanish authorities gave
rise to a sensational episode last week
Captain General Castellanos went in
person to the Spanish bank of Cuba
and demanded 850 in cash He was
accompanied by subordinate officials
After making the demand the captain
general offered a receipt or due bill of
the government The president of the
bank declared that it had not the cash
to meet the demand The captain gen
eral directed the cash drawers to be
opened by his subordisiates This was
done but no money was obtained A
meeting of the directors was then
called Instead of finding means to
satisfy the government they endorsed
the refusal of the president to suppis7
funds and affirmed a notjce previouelY
sent to depositors asking them to
withdraw their deposits temporarily
frthn the bank because of its semi
official relation to the Spanish gov
ernment It has heretofore submitted
to these enforced contributions but
the expectation of tardy American con
trol caused the decision to be taken to
advance no more funds Though
American authority was not estab
lished on Dec 1 as had been expected
there was no probability of the bank
yielding to Castellanos demand Other
financial institutions support its posi
lion
lionWhen
When the Spanish troops evacuated
Holguin in Santidgo province the
military commander went to the Hol
gum branch of the Spanish bank and
forcibly took what cash was left and
gave a government due bill The mci
dent had given lvsrnlng tO the directors
of the parent institution in Havana
and they had prepared for a visit from
the captain general
Notwithstanding the captain gen
esals failure to obtain money the
dissatisfaction of the troops over their
pay is repressed and the embarkation
continues without interruption

writers have been frank to admit for a
year or more that their estimation of the

large extent guesswork since they had
no reliable data to govern calculations of
that sort
