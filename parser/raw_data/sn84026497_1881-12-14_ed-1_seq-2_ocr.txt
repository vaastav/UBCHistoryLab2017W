THE FREStDENTS' MESSAGE.
Opinions of tha Press How it Was
Received, &o.
We issuts the first annual Message
ot l'resment Arthur in Ibe lorm ot a
supplement this week, and send it to
each of our subscriber as ate not
likely to get it in the daily papers. It
ia a lengthy but solid and able docu
ment, and will stand the test of criti
cism. The message ia of. more than
ordinary interest, being tbe first oi the
new President, hence we publish it in
full, knowing that our readers wonid
not be satisfied with a synopsis. Below
we give the opinions of a few of the
' leading papers of the country on this
important document :
The New York World, (Dem.) says :
"Everybody will admit the President's
message to be a business-like paper.
That, hofc-cver, ' too faint praise
which people are accustomed to bestow
upoa messages which are entirely
poiutlesp, and as President Arthur's
message 3,y no means pointless, the
stock phrase fails to do justice to it.
In fact, its distinction is that it is
pointed. It may almost be said to
bristle with points, when contrasted
with the smooth and arid imbecility of
Mr. Hayes' messages."
The New York Tribune remarks
that "the message is strongest on for
eign relations and finance ; but it is
sot weak anywhere. It is an admir
able business document, and deserres
praise as well for its manner aud
method as for the judicious recommen
dations which it makes."
The Herald. (Ind.) of the same city,
joins In the general approval and sums
up thu3 : "The message of President
Arthur is admirably written, calm and
dignified in style and tone and advises
Congress, as it is his constitutional
duty to-do, on so many important sub
jects with a wisdom and sound judg
ment which will win for him tbe public
confidence and for bis recommenda
tions the attentive consideration of
both house?." The Times, Evening
Post, and other New York papers, in
cluding those of Democratic proclivi
ties, speak in the same high terms of
commendation.
Turning to Philadelphia we find the
general current of criticism the same.
The Press says it is a "masterly mess
, age," and will "stand with the best of
the ninety-one which have been made
by his predecessors." It particularly
commends the President's treatment
of the subject of our foreign relations,
and declars that "in his recommenda
tions he is nowhere common-place, and
that he has public opinion with him on
most of bis weightier recommenda
tions. The North American sums up
its estimate in these words : "It is a
plain statement of a business year by
a business man. It neglects nothing,
and hence comprehends all." The
Record (Ind.) declars it has no misgiv
ings in laying the message before its
readers. "Throughout, from begin
ning to end, it is a plain straightfor
ward and healthy state paper. It is a
eausmog document, ana will at once
advance its author to the confidence of
his countrymen. The line of policy
jam down by mm is so clearly conserv
ative and so broadly patriotic .that it
must find favorable consideration in
every part of the Union. The Times
(Ind.) says "it is a sensible document,
and uncommonly free from political
affectation .and clap-trap."
Coming West we find tba Cincin
nati Enquirer (Dem.) commending the
message as a model free from poli
tics and partisanship, and a purely
businesa document. "We look upon
Mr. Arthur's message as a proper doc
ument a display of the affairs of the
country, and not a political harangue."
The Commercial (Ind.) says "it is con
servative in tone, and contains noth
ing to offend the sensibilities of any
one. It is a business-like document,
and will go far to confirm the opinion
formed f the President as a cool,
clear-headed and sensible man." The
Cleveland Herald holds that no one
can read the message "without being
impressed with the fact that the Presi
dent is a man of ability, sincerity and
decision. He has positive views on
public affairs and the courage to state
them, whilst at the same time he
raakes it plainly understood that he
has no personal policy to carry out
against the will of the people."
Commendations from papers of lesj
note and influence might be given
from all parts of the country, but the
abov is ample to show the strong cur
rent of pepular favor which the peru
sal of the message has set in motion.
The discordant carping and fault-find-iug
only serve to give emphasis and
Hstiuetneas to the general chorus of
r roval.
J. R. WHN1C,
Oenhuat. Kilpatmck, U. S. Min
ister to Chili, diftd last week.
The death of that veteran editor,
Col. John W. Forney, occurred in
Philadelphia on Friday morning last.
His fame will live fur ages,
TnE trial of the beast, Guitcau, still
lingers along. We have about con
cluded to make no more predictions as
to when it will end. We had hoped
to record a vernict of guilty by this
time, but we'll have to await awhile
yet. Tbe murderer is allowed to have
his own way pretty much in court,
and the country is beginning to think
the trial a very great farce.
Another of those horrible fires, the
details of which are so appalling to
read, occurred in Vienna, Austria, on
the night of the 8th inst. Several hun
dred people had assembled at the
RiDg theatre, and just as the perform
ance was about to begin a lamp fell
on the Btage and exploded, and be
fore the people had time to think, as
it were, the entire inside of the build
ing was enveloped in flames. Up to
the present writing the telegrams state
that over six hundred dead bodies
have been found, and over nine hun
dred are reported missing.
The Senate committees continue to
be Republican. David Davis voted
yesterday to continue them as organ
ized at the extra session. Before cast
ing his vote he defined his position as
being one in which he desires to co
operate with the Administration when
it is right and oppose it when it is
wrong. He believes the best way to
do this is to keep the Senate in polit
ical accord with the House and the
President, so that there can be no di
vided responsibility and no factious
opposition to the wishes of the major
ity. The position is sound as well as
fair, and David Davis advice to the
Democratic Senators to acquiesce is
not less renerous because thev ars
w
powerless to do anything else.
The name of Frederick T. Freling-
huysen, of New Jersey, was sent to the
Senate on Monday, and that bodv
confirmed without delay his nomina
tion as Secretary of State. The ap
pointment of Frelinghuysen gives very
general satisfaction, since that great
statesman, James G. Blaine, could not
be induced to stay. Of him the Der
rick says : "It will be a grateful change
for the great statesman and will prove
of lasting benefit to him. The ead
circumstances of last summer sapped
his life forces sadly, for few meu have
been called upon to pass through the
ordeal he was. To see the friend of
many years shot down by his side. To
watch the life of that dear friend, al
most brother ebb away slowly but
surely. To behold the giant intellect
and courageous spirit fade into death,
is a iriai wmcn very jew men are
called upon to endure. In the short
time in which Mr. Blaine has been at
the head of state matters he has proven
himself one of the best Secretaries of
State which ever held the portfolio,
has shown wisdom, prudence, fore
thought, courage and a thorough
knowledge of the needs and dignity of
(Jio natiou. If Mr. Frelinghuysen does
I f a .
one-naii as well the nation will not
complain but he follows one whom he
cannot equal, as he belongs to another
generation and is an entirely different
type of man."
WISCONSIN LETTER.
Dallas, Barron Co., Wisconsin,
December 29, 1881. j
Ed. Republican :
Thinking that i
lew line from the new "northwest"
would be of interest to your man
readers I submit the following :
mi . . a a k
ine settlement or iiarron county,
that is by actual farmers looking for
prominent homes, was begun some
twelve years ago, and under very great
disadvantages, arising from the great
distance intervening between any
point in this county, and any reliable
market town in the surrounding
country, being all the way from forty
to sixty and seventy miles. The
county had, prior to this settlement,
been the rendesvous of lumbermen,
who transported their logs down tow
1- it - .... . ..
rus me iuississippi in tue various
streams that meander through the
county, for be it known, that this is
great lumbering county, as well as
bei ng among the best for agricultural
purposes. Some six years ago the first
railroad was built in the county, or
rather, through the Dorth western por
tion of the county ; during tho present
season another railroad has been gra
ded right through the central portion
of the county, ond by noxt June the
rails will be laid and the cars running.
A survey is also being made for the
third railroad through the county, and
the indications now are that it will be
built inRide of eighteen months at the
farthest.
The county seat is located very
nearly in ths geographical centre of
the county, is named "Barron," and we
have a good court house and jail, and
in fact all tbe essentials that usually
belong to a first-class county seat. All
the various kinds of grain that is usu
ally grown in Pennsylvania does well
here, and the yield here is far more
than in Pennsylvania, and the country
seems to be naturally adapted to grow
ing vegetables of all descriptions.
The original settlers here, nearly all
became owners of farms by homestead
or pre-emption, but that day is past
here, aud the man that expects to
secure a home by homestead ing will
have to journey uway beyond Barron
county, in the direction of the setting
sun. There are yet chances to pur
chase laud iu the county very cheap
and on very reasonable terms ; that is
on all the way from three to five
years' time, and at very reasonable
rates of interest.
Any person that wishes to work du
ring the winter seasou can always se
cure a job fru some of the various
lumbering companies doing business
in this and the adjoining counties. The
wages rate all the way from eighteen
to thirty dollars per month, or accord
ing to the ability of the applicant to
perform manual labor. There are
some five large grist mills in the
county aud several more in contem
plation. Two of the mills already
built cost nearly thirty thousand dol
lars apiece, and are stocked with all
the latest improvements in the milling
business.
It is very likely that when spring
opens thnre will be lively times in the
railroad building business here, and an
extraordinary large demand for men
and teams, for that was the casa du
ring the past summer aud fall, and the
opening of spring will start business
more brisk than ever before known.
Men were paid two dollars per day in
cash for working on the railroad here
this season, and a man and team re
ceived four dollars per day in cash.
The total assessed valuation of this
county for the year 1881, was $1,209
56G.60, and during the coming year it
will be very largely increased owing
to the advent of large amounts of capi
tal invested in enterprises of different
kinds but all ter. Mng towards tho de
velopment of this county.
Yours, Peter S. Lindal.
