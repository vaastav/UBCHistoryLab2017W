DISGOSSiNfi THE NEW TREATY.
Objection Raised to Some of its
Terms-Southern Senators Lead
Opposition.
Washington, Dec. 6.-The senate
committee on foreign relations report?
ed favorably on the new Hay-Paunce
fote treaty providing for the construc?
tion of an isthmian canal.
The committee was in session for
almost two hours and went over in de?
tail the provisions of the convention.
-No votes were cast against it, but it
was criticised very sharply by Sena?
tors Money and Bacon, who found in
it many "of the objections which
they raised against the old treaty.
They took especial exception to the
provision continuing in force the neu?
trality provisions of the Clayton-Bul
wer treaty, and also to police the canal
as placing a iimtiation upon the pow?
der of this country to absolutely con?
trol it. The contention was made that
the effect of the treaty as sent to the
senate would be to deprive the United
States of the control of the canal in
case of war. Especial attention was
cailedjto the provision in the pream?
ble of the pending treaty reserving
article 8 of the Clayton-Bul wer treaty
from the repeal provision of the new
treaty. The portion of this atrticle
of the old treaty to which especial
objection was maude, reads as follows :
"In granting, however, their joint
protection to any such canals or rail?
ways as are by this article specified, it
is always understood by the United
States and Great Britain that the par?
ties constructing or owning ? the same
shall impose no other charges or con?
ditions of traffic thereupon than the
aforesaid governments shall approve
of as just and equitable ; and that the
same canals or railways, being open
to the citizens and subjects of the
"United States and Great Britain on
?equal terms,shall also be open on like
terms to the citizens and subjects of
?very other State which is willing to
grant thereto such protection as the
United States and Great Britain en?
gage to afford."
Senators Money and Bacon did not
go to the extent of voting against the
report of the treaty, and they acknowl?
edged they are anxious to see it ' rati?
fied because of their great desire to
have the canal built. Still, they in?
sisted that the treaty as it now stands
is very objectionable in case of the
.contingency of war.
Senator Frye presided over the
meeting and he authorized Senator
Lodge to report the treaty to the senate
on Monday next in case there should
be an executive session on that day.
It also was the sense of the commit?
tee that the consideration of the treaty
should be pressed as speedily as possi?
ble in the senate, some senators
oxpresing the hope tb.at action might
be secured before the adjournment for
the holidays. The ?omniittee also
votes to recommend that the injune- !
idon of secrecy be removed from the
treaty.
Senator Bacon moved the revival
of the amendment to the original
Hay-Pauncefote treaty which was sug?
gested by Senator Davis, then chair?
man of the committee, and adopted by
the senate. That amendment pro?
vided that nothing in the treaty should
""apply to measures which the United
States may find it necessary to take
for securing by its own forces the de?
fense of the United States and the
maintenance of public order."
The amendment was voted down
viva voce.
ISTHMIAN CANAL BILL.
i Washington, Dec. 6.-Representative
Hepburn, of Iowa, introduced his
isthmian canal bill, which, by reason
of his being the author of the bill
passed last year and his probable
appointment on che commerce
committee, . is regarded as the
measure which will serve as a basis for
action by the house. It differs from
the Hepburn bill* passed last year in
making the total appropriation $180, -
OOO, OOO instead of $140, OOO, OOO. Of the
total amount $10,000,000 is made im?
mediately available to begin work
in other respects the bill follows that
of last year, authorizing the president
to acquire a right of way from Costa
Bica and Nicaragua, and then to di?
rect the secretary of war to begin the
construction, from Greytown on the
Caribbean sea to Bri to on the Pacific
ocean, with suitable defenses* etc.

Jonesville, Dec. 4.-Mr. Oliver
Eaves, a farmer living a few miles
from Jonesville, went to Union day
before yesterday and sold some cotton,
and on his way home about night he
was attacked by three or four negroes,
knocked senseless and robbed. Fortu?
nate for Mr. Eaves he had deposited
all his money at Union but about six
dollars, which the robbers got.
Portland, Ore., Dec. 4.-The Port?

tended meeting, rejected the so-called
"Massachusetts plan" for the admis?
sion of delegates to the approaching
general federation at Los Angeles, by
state organization and the admission
of colored women delegates. The effect
of this action is to draw the color line.
Atlanta, Ga., Dec. 4.-A resolution
was introduced in both branches of
the Georiga leigslature today memo?
rializing the United States congress to
pass a bill appropriating proportion?

cotton tax lund, to educational pur?
poses in the south.

above the United States.-Star.
TIE CHERRY TREE MAN.
Light Thrown on the Patronym of
this Brilliant Financier.
A new method of "making money"
has developed in western Carolina and
upper South Carolina which has
made those who started the enterprise
rich, while those who became agents
are realizing bountifully. This par?
ticular enterprise is called the "Amos
Owen Cherry Tree company," of
Rutherford county. What it is, or
what its particular methods are, we
have not learned. It has developed to
the degree that some of our esteemed
oont?mpora ries, notably the Charlotte
Observer, have felt called upon to sug?
gest in unmistakable but mild terms
that it is a "fake."
But the name is striking. A com?
bination, of "Amos Owen" and the
"Cherry Tvree" would naturaly in?
spire' confidence in western North
Carolina. Every school boy knows
the virtue which has attached to the
cherry tiee since the days of George
"Washington, who afterwards achieved
some distinction in grubbing up an?
other tree which had taken root on
this side of the Atlantic. The "Amos
Owen" prefix however, is not so well
appreciated by the world at large.
If our memory serve? us well, a
gentleman by that name who hailed
from the Rutherford neighborhood or
settlement was an inveterate frequent?
er o.f the federal court at Asheville
during the late Judge Dicks adminis
tration, and as persistently intruded
himself upon the defendant side of the
docket devoted to those whose "per
suasion" led them to cultivate the
worm which though it dieth in one
spot lives to "run' in another. Uncle
Amos was one of those intensely loyal
old patriots when believed this was a
free country, and anything to the con?
trary was due solely to the pernicious
activity of the federal courts-a new
invention of the radical party so far as
his knowledge went-and its minions.
"Before the war" he had indulged in
the exhilerating if not always profit?
able pastime of converting the corn of
the valleys into the dew of the moun?
tains and there was none to make
him afraid. It requred frequent semi?
annual visits to Asheville, and a seri?
ous but sympathetic interview on each
occasion with Judge Dick, ending in
varitably with the kindly admonition
"$100 and costs," to convince the old
gentleman that Uncle Sam insisted on
a "davide" in all such undertakings
After having gone through this per
formance time after time, and the
name of "Amos Owen" was again
called in court, the amiable and kindly
hearted judge ventured to express sur
prise not unmingled with disappoint
meut and a, little disgust that such
things could be year in and year ont,
and addressing the venerable defendant
said: "Amos, I am surprised to see
you here again, -after the leniency of
the court in the past and your solemn
promise that you would not violate
the law .again. I see I must be more
severe with you. You have given this
court a great deal of trouble"
And right here was Amos' opportu?
nity and he seized it with both hands,
He interrupting, with that sharp,
shrill voice of his, and with a dead
earnestness in his blue eyes, said
"Yes, ?edge, and this court has gin
me a great deal of trouble too'."
Amos went home with the usual
'$100 and costs." And we suspect
the "$100" with all its predecessors
stands on the docket to his "credit"
to this day, but never adding any?
thing to Uncle Sam's treasury.
If a ""Cherry Tree" enterprise has
been turned loose upon our western
friends with the patronymical
endorsement of the "Amos Owen" of
old, we are not surprised that it has
been a howling success from the start.
A coombination of Amos Owen and
the Cherry Tree must possess virtues
of some sort of good for the human
family if taken with prudence and
strictly according to directions.
Aa SY?ssf?list's Story.
"I suffered for years with a bronchial
or lung trouble and tried various remedies
but did not obtain permanent relief until
I commenced using One Minute Cough
Cure," writes Rev. Jasi KirSman, evange?
list of Belle River, 111. UI have no hesita?
tion in recommending it to ali sufferers
from maladies of this kind." One Minute
Cough Cure affords immediate relief for
coughs, colds and all kinds of throat and
lung troubles. For croup it is unequalled.
Absolutely safe. Very pleasant to take,
never fails and is really a favorite -with the
children. They like it-J S Hughson &

ELEVATOR MANNERS.
The south is the only part of the
country where the habit of removing
their hats when they find ladies in an
elevator is generally observed by gen?
tlemen. Washington is largely a
southern city and this custom is re?
garded by a majority of men there,
though it is nothing like as common
as it is in Atlanta and other distinct?
ly southern cities.
An effort is being made to abolish
the habit of removing hats in eleva?
tors.
In the corridors of several large office
buildings notices have been conspicu?
ously posted to the effect that good
taste does not require this courtesy.
It is said, however, that tho men
behave just as they formerly did when
riding in elevators with lady passen?
gers. Those who were in the habit of
removing their hats continue to do so
regardless of the gratuitous informa?
tion that good taste does not require
that mark of respect, for ladies. These
gentlemen prefer to decide matters Jof
taste for themselves and not leave
them to the proprietors or janitors of
office buildings.
It is. of course, a question of taste
whether men should take off their
hats when riding in elevators with
ladies. Some men see no sense in it,
and therefore do not do it. Others
consider it courteous and respectful to
observe the custom and would feel
uncomfortable if they were compelled
to keep their hats on when they met
ladies in elevators. No law or notice
in office buildings or anywhere can
carry into effect notices that gentle?
men should not remove their hats in
elevators and so every man will con?
tinue to do as he pleases about the
matter.
We expect to see our present custom
observed by men generally in the
south for a long time to come.

QUEEN OF HOLLAND'S
UNHAPPY MARRIAGE.
She and Her Prince Consort Do Not
Bet Along Well, Bot She Has
Gallant Defenders.
London, Dec. 6.-A dispatch to The
Evening News from The Hague, pub?
lished today says :
"Peace reigns again at the palace,
and the happiest man in Holland is
Maj. Van Tete, who was wounded in
defense . of Queen Wilhelmina, by
Prince Henry, or, as all Dutchmen
now contemptuously call him 'the
German. ' Van Tete is one of the ten
noble youths who formed the body
guard of the smiling young queen
when she was married in February,
and who have since been at their royal
mistress' beck and call on every occa?
sion. They pride themselves on their
servitude, and in this matter of fact
twentieth century their chivalrous'
devotion to Queen Wilhelmina is a
pretty thing to see. It is whispered
that every man of the ten handsome
yoHths who surround her majesty's
carriage when she drives abroad,
skate with her when she skates, ride
with her when she rides and dance at?
tendance on her generally has been, at
one time or another, over head and
ears in love with the dainty little
lady in whom Holland's hopes are
centered. Official contradictions not?
withstanding nobody at The Hague
doubts for a moment that the queen
and her consort have been at logger?
heads practically since the wedding.
Prince Henry is an unpleasant person.
He eats too much, drinks too freely
and hunting occupies him far more
than his wife, and Wilhelmina, on her
side, is not a woman to allow herself
to be neglected with impunity. It is
said that she staunched Van Tets
wound with her own hands, and in?
sisted on her husband begging par?
don of the Jonkherr as well as of her?
self before she would forgive him.?
All the romance of the marriage of
Wilhelmina and the man she herself
chose has disappeared."

A poor complexion is usually the result
of a torpid liver or irregular action of the
bowels. Unless nature's refuse is carried
off it will surely cause impure blood.
Pimples, boils and other eruptions follow.
This is nature's method of throwing off
the poisons which the bowels, failed to re?
move. DeWitt's Little Early Risers are
world famous for remedying this condi?
tion. They stimulate the liver and pro?
mote regular and healthy action of the
bowels, but never cause griping, cramps
or distress. Safe pills.-J S Hughson <fc

Vaccination in London.
The statistics of smallpox in London,
England, when 420 cases had been re?
ported up to Saturday last, present a
tough nut for the anti-vaccinationists
to crack. The rate of mortality among
the vaccinated was 20 per cent. ; among
the un vaccinated, 60.
All of the twenty-three smallpox pa?
tients under five years of age were un
vaccinated, and nineteen died. Of
those under ten all but one were vac?
cinated, and twenty-nine out of forty
two died Of eighty-one children un?
der fifteen years of age fifty-seven were
unvaccinated and thirty-eight died;
twenty-four were vaccinated and
twenty-three of them recovered. Out
of fourteen unvaccinated patients over
forty years of age twelve died. These
specific cases are more impressive
than the total, but even this shows
an immense advantage for the vacci?
nated. The disease seems to have
taken on a very virulent type in Lon?
don, judging by the number of deaths.
It is said that it is not true that the
poorest districts have suffered most,
but that no part of London has been
exempt. Courier Journal.

HO FREE TRADE FOR PHILIPPINES.
Senator Lodge Introduces a Bill
Levying Tariff on Imports and
Exports.
Washington, D. C., Dec. ^-Senator
Lodge today introduced a bill to pro?
vide revenue for the Philippine isl?

secretary of war shall remain in full
force and .effect. This covers goods
going into the islands.
The second section of the bill pro?

tariff on goods coming into the United
States from the Philippine Islands
that are now collected from foreign
countries.
Section four provides that all duties
collected in the Philippine Islands
shall be paid into the Philippine

Engine Over a Cliff.
Vancouver, B. C., Dec. 6.-At an
early hour this morning a Canadian
Pacific freight train was proceeding
east at a slow rate around a dangerous
curve, 400 feet above the Frazier river,
when Engineer Randall suddenly came
upon a rock slide scarcely 50 " yards
ahead of him. A signal was given to
the brakemen and the engine was
reversed, but it was too late. The
train was going scarcely five miles an
hour, but the heavy train behind piled
the engine on the rocks and before
the engineer and fireman could jump,
the engine rolled over and over 300
feet down the bluff to the river. Engi?
neer Randall and Fireman Potruff were
crushed to death beneath the engine.
Three cars were wrecked, going over
the bank after the engine. Traffic
was delayed six hours.
A St. Louis judge has decided that

the law makes them a ground for
divorce." Just how much slapping a
