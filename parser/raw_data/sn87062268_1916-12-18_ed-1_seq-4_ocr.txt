SPEEDING UP THE NEW SCHOOL.
The immediacy of response to a sug
gestion contained in these columns yester
day, with a mass meeting called for Wed
nesday night to determine on the new
high school building, shows how accurately
Tm? Journal interpreted public opinion and
its demands in this important direction.
As is announced elsewhere in this issue,
the meeting will be held at the city hall.
"and will be called to order at half past seven
bv Mrs. D. Kugleman, president of the
Parents and Teachers' bqciety.
City officials, educators, and the citizen
ship generally will thus be enabled to take
council together and determine their course
in what promises to be one of the most
democratic appeals to popular government
in the history of Pensacola.
To Professor Rogers, principal of the
school; to R. Pope Reese, and the other
members of the investigating committee;
'to Superintendent of Education Edwards,
and to Mayor Hinrichs, the thanks of the
community are especially due for their zeal
in arranging the details of the meeting;
nor should reference be omitted to the
Parents and Teachers' Society, the Rotary
club, and the numerous private lndivduals
whose interest has helped crystahze sen
timent. , The future is now in the hands of the
people of Pensacola.
MARK TWAIN AND THE KAISER.
Professor Alphonso Smith, Roosevelt ex
change professor at the University of
Berlin m 1911, describing an interview with
the kaiser, says:
"He reads Mark Twain, or has read to
him, and he ? enjoys him, but he said that
when he met Mark Twain, it was only with
the greatest difficulty that he could get
him to talk at all.
Commenting on which the. Montgomery
Advertiser is mildly shocked to learn that
the great philosopher should have been
abashed in the presence of royalty.
Mark Twain tells how, at the beginning
of his career, when he was introduced' to
General Grant, he said. "General I'm em
barrassed are you?" And years later, when
the author, famous then, was introduced ,to
President Grant, the latter opened the con
versation with, "I'm not at all embarrassed
are you?" ,
Mark Twain mentions Prince Edwardr
the Empress of Austria,, and some royalty
of more or lesser light, but always in a sat
irical sense; but unless our memory plays
us false, he never, in any of his writings or
speeches alludes to the kaiser. In an author
so subjective, is not this significant? Does

COST OF GARBAGE DISPOSAL.
Statistics gathered' from thirty-six cities,
ranging from 10,000 to 465,000 in popula
tion, show that Pensacola's system of.
garbage collection and disposal compares
very favorably, in cost, with that of the
most modern centers of the United States.
Strangely enough, the highest and lowest
costs are found in Ohio. The garbage bill
of Canton is $1.38 a year per capita; while
in Dayton it is only fifteen cents.
Altoona, Penn., 52,000 inhabitants,
spends $42,600 a year on the collection and
disposal of garbage, a per capita cost of
82 cents; Charleston, S. C, 58,000, $4,00Q
or 17 cents; Richmond, Ind., 22,000, $7,200.
or 32 cents ; Zanesville, Ohio, 28,000, $6,500,
'or 23 cents. Dayton, with a population of
116,000, spends $53,000, but receives a
- vearlv revenue of 30.000 to 40 000 from

' the reduction plant, which explains its low
"pir capita cost .'"
' : Ii Pensacola the cost of collecting
garbage amounts to $500 a month, or $6,000
a year,nd is contracted to private enter
prise. Incineration, however, is at the city's
t expense, but the wages of the two foremen
and their assistants, together with the de
preciation on the plant and the interest on
the investment, will hardly bring the total
cost up to $8,000, which will mean a per
capita cost of about 30 cents.
If the cost is to be lowered further, some
such plan as Dayton's reduction method
must be adopted. Cities throughout the
country are turning their waste into profit-
aDie industries. Jfaper, rags and metal
have a high value, and other substances, in
stead of being destroyed, are turned into
fertilizer.

This would be an excellent opportunity
tor a little homily on democracy vs. king

though democratic to the degree of going
into the parlor, when his wife had company,
without his collar on, and jionest enough
to send it to the lady's house afterwards
with a polite little note calling attention to
the fact that he really did possess such an
article of raiment, was not averse to kings.
Quite the contrary, he has paid the greatest

Mark Twain wasn't embarrassed by the
kaiser. The nearest he ever came to being
embarrassed was when he first met General
Grant if you would call it embarrassment.
But Mark Twain was interested in men-
whether king or beggar; convention and ar

To those of us who knew him, his
memory is as a blessing and a bene

the state make acknowledgment, in
cident to the anniversary of his birth
of its high regard for him, and that
these expressions be transmitted to

unusual significance. Tampa Tribune.
MILK ROOM.
The milk room should be & build
ing other than the barn. It should be
located if possible with a northeast
ern exposure. Immediately after b
ing. drawn the milk should be strained
and put in shallow pans to cool quick
ly. This applies to conditions where
a milk cooler cannot be used. Where
no separator is available it is neces
sary to cool the milk aa soon as pos
sible to enable the t cream to rise.
Where five or more cows are milked
it Is advisable to invest In a mm
separator, becaus running the milk
through a separator Immediately aftr
mllking Is the best way known for
getting absolutely clean rrUk, -t ,'en If
the whole milk is to be used. The.
cream and skimmed milk from the
separator can be mixed after the sep
arating, and the milk that has un
dergone this process is a good .deal
cleaner than where the farmer simply
follows ordinary methods. The action
of the separator cleans the milk of al!
the slimy and undesirable contents
which attach themselves to the inside
of the bowl and can be easily removed
when cleaning it. Where a certain
amount of cream is reserved for
churning, the remaining crvam and
skimmed milk can be reunited and
used on the table.
COOLING THE MILK.
It Is desirable, where possible, t
cool the milk immediately after milk
ing.. A temperature of fifty degrees Is
desirable for several reasons. The
bacteria present in the milk will not
multiply so readily as in high temper
ature, and an increase in bacterial
number will sour the milk rapidly.
We can readily see that quick cooling
and the maintaining of a low temper
ature will prevent or at least delay
sourins for a considerable time.
A BUNCH OF FLOWERS
Bill Russell, may his tribe increase,
has a beautiful mernoriam in the last
issue of the Palatka News on Frank
Mayes, editor of The Pensacola Jour
nal, who died last December. We add
our bunch of flowers to the memorial,
for Frank Mayes was. one o; Nature's
noblemen who was taken from our
circle in the prime of life and in the
midst of a most useful career. He has
gone from our life but he will live
forever in our memory as one of, the
brightest and best men of our age.
