THE WEEK'S EVENTS
A dispatch from Halifax, N. S., says
no logical attempt has made to check
up or revise the long list of dead and
injured resulting from the disaster
when a munition ship's cargo exploded
in the harbor. The morgue officials
held to their estimate of 4,000 dead,
but other observers said that estimate
was too great by half.
It is said that between twenty mil
lion and twenty-five million dollars
will be required for the Halifax suf
ferers. Additional reports from Vice Admi
ral Sims began to unfold the story of
the torpedoefng of the destroyer Ja
cob Jones, but did not lessen the toll
of lives lost with the ship. Only 44 of
110 or more officers and jnen aboard
are known to have survived, includ

.While the Russian soldiers on a
great section of the eastern front have
agreed to a ten day armistice with the
Austro-Germans, there are indications
that the Bolsheviki government in Pe

suggestions for either government op

As a counter to any antatgonistic
movement the Bolsheviki government
has ordered its troops and followers
immediately to set to work to put
down the uprising forbidding even any
attempts at mediation.
A proclamation to the Russian na
tion has been issued by the Russian
government announcing that "Kale

imperialists and constitutional demo
crats, have raised a revolt and de
clared war in the Don region against
the people and the revolution."
No details of the Russian uprising
have been received in any of the allied

NEWS REVIEW OF
THE PAST WEEK
President's Message Declaring
America in War to Finish,
Hailed With Joy.
ADDS AUSTRIA TO OUR FOES
Progress of Russia's Efforts for Ar
mistice Germans Sacrifice Men
Recklessly in Furious Attacks
in France and Italy
American Troops to
Be Rushed Across.
By EDWARD W. PICKARD.
The United States is In the war to
the finish and that finish must be the
overthrow of the Prussian military
despotism, the liberation and restora
tion of the peoples it has enslaved
and reparation for the material dam
age its armies have done. When this
is assured, the United States will in
sist on a peace that is based on gen
erosity and Justice to all alike, ex
cluding all selfish claims to advantage
even on the part of the victors. Mean
while Austria-Hungary must be form
ally declared our foe in the war, and
"our present and Immediate task" Is
to win that war.
Such in a few words Is the message
of President Wilson to congress, to
America, and especially to the world.
He leaves no doubt of the govern
ment's and the nation's humanitarian
alms, and he makes equally plain the
determination never to make peace
with the present rulers of Germany
who have done such "deep and abom
inable wrong." The president ex
pressly disavows any intention to im
pair or rearrange the Austro-Hunga-rian
empire, but says that to the
Austro-Hungarians should be restored
Independent control of their own af
fairs, and avers that the Balkan states
and Turkey should be secured against
foreign oppression or Injustice. Mr.
Wilson's polished diction does not con
ceal his contempt for the pacifists, the
traitors and others who seek to ham
per the nation In the prosecution of
the war. When everyone else within
sound of his voice arose and cheered
the president's impassioned statements.
Senator La Follette, Representative
Mason and one or two mere sulked si
lent in their seats. They are easily
classified.
Message Warmly Approved.
Instant approval of the message was
general throughout the United States,
and it received the hearty endorse
ment of the British and South Ameri
can press, though some of the London
papers, notably the Times, are skep
tical about the distinction the presi
dent still makes between the German
rulers and the German people. It must
be confessed a great many Americans
also feel the German people are not
so guiltless as Mr. Wilson represents
them.
Congress lost little time in starting
proceedings for formal declaration of
war against Austro-Hongary, and gov
ernment agents throughout the coun
try at once began preparing to handle
the million and a half enemy aliens
which it adds to the list. As tens of
thousands of Austro-Hungarians have
been employed in the mines of Amer
ica, there Is danger of a serious short
age of mine labor. It Is likely a good
deal of discrimination will be used In
dealing with such subjects of the dual
monarchy, as the Bohemians and vari
ous Slavic races, who have no sym
pathy with the autocracy of their
rulers.
Bolsheviki Peace Efforts.
The efforts of the Russian bolshe
viki to bring about a general cessation
of fighting was not markedly success
ful last week. Large numbers of Rus
sian troops were withdrawn from the
front lines, and Austro-Hungary for
mally approved of the armistice plan ;
but when the representatives of
the Russians began discussion of de
rails with the Germans they met with
:i quick check. Their first two stipu
lations were that the enemy should
not undertake to send forces from
:he Russian front to the front of Rus
sia's allies, and that the German de
tachments should be withdrawn from
the islands of Moon sound. To this
the German delegates replied evasive
ly, merely promising to consult their
government.
On Thursday Berlin announced that
a suspension of hostilities along the
entire' Russian front for ten days be
ginning Friday noon had been arrang
ed. The same day Trotzky declared
the Russian government did not want
a separate peace.
There were reports, which, however,
were emphatically denied,. that Rou
mania desired to open negotiations
for an armistice. If their flank on
the north were left unprotected by the
quitting of the Russians, the Rouman
an forces between the Dniester and
the Black sea would be in extreme
peril. Members of the Red Cross mis
sion of Roumanla have Just brought
to President Wilson a message from
King Ferdinand declaring his country
would never make a separate peace.
Ensign Krylenko is now in control
of much of the Russian army, his men
having captured the headquarters at
Mohilev and murdered General Duk
honin, former commander in chief.
At last reports General Kaledines'
Cossacks were marching on Vitebsk
and a battle with Krylenko's forces
was impending. Most of the Russian
diplomatic representatives in allied
countries and the Russian troops in
France have disowned the doings of
the bolsheviki leaders and refuse to
recognize their authority.
Germans Try Hard for Big Victory.
It is evident that the German high
command is trying desperately to ob
tain a decisive military victory In
France or Italy, or both, before the
American army gets across in suffi
cient force to be effective. So far the
result achieved by the enemy has been
the gain of a few rods of ground at
an appalling cost in loss of life. The
fighting in the Cambrai sector devel
oped Into the bloodiest and fiercest
battle of the war, and despite the
bringing up of great numbers of Ger
many's best troops, the British in the
main repulsed the repeated mass at
tacks and held most of the ground
gained the previous week. If Byng
can continue to hang on to his posi
tions, the battle will prove the best
thing the British could ask, for It has
brought the Germans "out of their
holes" and not only own them up
as Inferior in open fighting, but cost
them an enormous number of their
most valuable men. The reckless sac
rifices made by Crown Prince Rup
precht contrast strangely with the in
formation that Germany is training
boys of fifteen and sixteen to take
their places soon in the fighting lines.
America has cause for pride and
satisfaction in the reports that come
of the part in the Cambrai fighting
taken by American engineers. Caught
by a sudden advance of the Germans,
these men took shelter until the Brit
ish came up to them, and then, borrow
ing guns, went into the fray with a
gallantry and coolness that won high
praise from the commanding officers of
the British. A few of them were
killed and wounded, but the others
went right on with their fighting, pa
trolling and railroad building.
Fierce Fighting In Italy.
Along the Italian front the fighting
has been little less fierce than at Cam
brai, and as the week closed the Austro-Germans
were making their sec
ond great offensive there. In the in
itial attack by largely Increased forces
the enemy compelled the Italians to
withdraw from some advanced posi
tions between Monte Tonderecar and
Monte Badenecche, but elsewhere the
violent assaults were repulsed. If
the invaders succeed in that sector In
flanking the Piave and Brenta lines,
they might force General Diaz back as
far as the Adige. However, the Italian
commander seemed quite confident he
could prevent this, and his forces were
gallantly guarding the entire line
while increasing numbers of British
and French re-enforcements continued
to arrive. Among the allies in action
on this front are a number of Ameri
can aviators, and the declaration of
war against Austria-Hungary seems to
make sure the speedy dispatching of
a" considerable force of American sol
diers to re-enforce the Italians. At
any rate that is what Italy expects,
and the entire country celebrated Joy
ously the news that its chief foe was
to be included in the enemies of the
United States.
U. S. Troops to Be Hurried Over.
One of the main subjects discussed
in the .interallied conference in Paris
was the best means of getting Ameri
can troops to France as rapidly as pos
sible and supplying them with muni
tions and food. To release as much
tonnage as may be for the purpose
of carrying the American soldiers an
international organization was created
that will co-ordinate the utilization of
transport facilities, somewhat restrict
ing the imports of the various nations.
It may be that a considerable part of
the supplies for the American army
will be obtained from England and
France in order to save time.
The allies Intend to bring out their
full man power, and the troops of the
United States are to be taken to the
front as quickly as It can be done.
There Is no doubt that this is the plan
of the government, despite the opinion
of Von Hindenburg and Von Luden
dorff that America was raising a great
army only to protect IfSelf against Ja
pan and would not be so "foolish" as
to send it to Europe. If those gen
tlemen read the president's message
some glimmer of truth as to the real
determination of the United States
may penetrate their skulls.
China May Send an Army.
Before very long yet another na
tional army may be fighting beside the
allies In France against Germany. It
is reported that a large force from
China is to be brought to the west
ern front, probably under the com
mand of General Yeng-Chang, chief
general adjutant to the Chinese presi
dent. For a long time many thou
sands of Chinese have been working
behind the lines In France, and doubt
less the well-trained and equipped
armed forces of the Oriental republic
also will be welcome there.
From Palestine General Allenby sent
word that he was In a position to en
ter Jerusalem at any time he saw fit,
but was continuing an enveloping
movement to the north of the Holy
City.
Equally satisfactory is the news
from East Africa, the British com
mander there reporting that the last
Germans had been cleared from that
vast region. All who were not killed
or captured had fled to Portuguese
territory, where they would soon be
attended to, he said. Thus Germany
has been stripped of the last of her
colonies.
Interallied Naval Council.
An Important decision of the coun
cil In Paris was to create an Inter
allied naval council in order to close
contact and complete co-operation be
tween the navies of the allies. The
council will be composed of the min
isters of marine and admiralty chiefs
of the nations represented. The war
fare on the submarines is proceeding
satisfactorily, but the last British ad
miralty report shows the toll of the
U-Boats Is still high, 16 British ves
sels of more than 1,600 tons and five
others having been sunk In the week.
Among the boats torpedoed was the
steamer Apapa, 80 passengers and the
crew perishing. The submarine shell
ed the vessel's open boats that were
filled with women and children.
Early Thursday morning a fleet of
big German airplanes made a raid on
England and several of them succeed
ed In reaching London. Their bombs
killed seven persons. At least two of
the raiding machines were brought
down by gun fire and their crews cap
tured. War Stamps on Sale.
The sale of war savings stamps
and certificates, America's newest
plan for raising war funds and encour
aging thrift, began on Monday, and
was taken up by the entire country
with an enthusiasm that presages its
complete success. The campaign will
continue for one year, and It Is be
lieved the maximum sum authorized
$2:000,000,000 will be obtained with
out trouble.
The interstate commerce commission
having recommended the nationaliza
tion of the railroads during the contin
uation of the war, the president and
his aids took up the matter last week,
and Mr. Wilson was expected soon to
send to congress a special message on
the subject. The administration con
ceded that the roads must be given
liberal financial aid and a plan may be
evolved for their operation under a
government director of transportation.
The most terrible of the many dis
asters incident to the war befell Hali
fax, N. S., on Thursday, when the
French munition ship Mont Blanc ex
ploded In the harbor after being ram
med by a Belgian relief vessel. Some
5,000 persons were killed, many thou
sands injured and a considerable part
of the city and its suburbs wrecked
by the awful blast.
SWAY OF TURK IS NEAR
El
Allenby, Accompanied by British and
French Officers Occupy Jerusalem
Turks Effort Against Suez Canal
and Egypt Collapsed.
London. Andrew Bonar Law, chan
cellor of the exchequer, announced in
the house of commons that Jersualem
after being surrounded on all sides by
British troops, had surrendered.
The chancellor said British, French
and Mohammedan representatives
were on the way to Jersualem to safe
guard the holy places.
General Allenby reported that on
Saturday he attacked the enemy's po
sitions south and west of Jerusalem
the chancellor said Welsh and home
county troops, advancing from the di
rection of Bethlehem, drove back the
enemy and, passing Jerusalem on
the east, establishing themselves on
the Jerusalem-Jericho road. At the
same time, London infantry and dis
mounted yeomanry attacked the strong
I enemy positions west and northwest
of Jerusalem and placed themselves
astride the Jrusalem-Shchem road.
The holy city, being thus isolated, sur
rendered to General Allenby.
I . The chancellor said General Allen
by entered Jerusalem officially, accom
panied by the officers of the French
and Brititsh forces.
The capture of Jersualem by the
British forces marks the end, with two
brief interludes, of more than 1,200
years possession of the seat of the
Christian religion by the Mohamme
dans. For 756 years the eholy city
has been in undisputed possession of
Mohammedans, the last Christian
ruler of Jersualem beeing the German
emperor, Frederick II, whose short-lived
dominations lasted from 1229 to
1244.
The Turks have held sway in Jeru
salem since 1517 when they overcame
the Mammelukes.
Apart from its connection with the
campaign being waged against Tur
key by the British in Mesopotamia,
the fall of Jersualem marks the defi
nite collapse of the long protracted
efforts of the Turks to capture the
Suez canal and invade Egypt.

era From Task.
Halifax, N. S. A roaring blizzard,
the third to strike this sorely afflicted
city since the blast from the explod
ing munitions steamer made 25,000
persons homeless four days ago, burst
from the northeast. Raging with all
the fury for which these northern
winter storms are noted, it all but
crushed the hearts of the brave band
of workers struggling against over
whelming odds to alleviate suffering.
For a while the contingents of the
Canadian army stationed here toiled
doggedly amid the ice-shrouded ruins
for the unrecovered dead, but when
! the wind veered suddenly to the south
east and blew with redoubled force,
the soldiers were obliged to withdraw.
Pungs bearing hospital supplies and
food to the numerous relief stations
were storm-bound. The crippled light
ing system broke down again, leaving
the city in darkness.
Burial parties who had volunteered
their services were driven to cover.
From the devastated area of two and
a half square miles, hundreds of men
and women patiently seeking their
dead gave up their task for still an
other day and sought shelter.
Relief trains bringing workers and
supplies reached the city in the
heights of the blizzard, but those so
eager to help found themselves help
less and knew not which way to turn
in the confusion of the storm, the un
lighted city and the wreckage.
UNIFICATION OF ALL
RAILROADS DURING WAR
Washington. President Wilson will
go to Congress for special legislation
to bring about unification of the rail
roads during the war. That the Pres
ident has decided definitely on such
a move became known after he had
gone over the whole transportation
situation with Senator Newlands,
chairman of the senate interstate
commerce committee. He probably
will ask for the legislation in an ad
dress before Christmas holidays.
