Cleveland is credit-d with having in-J

1 ear's Ulplouuitic Work.
Taking up some of the detslla ol
the yen's diplomatic work, the Pres-.
Went refers with expressions of pride
to China, where "th.- p..11... ?.f ?en?
couraging financial Investme-it t.. en?
able that country to help itself has
had the result of giving new llf- and
practical application to ?he open-ooor
policy." The consistent purpose has
been to encourage the use of Ameri?
can cat ital in China, say* the Presi?
dent, to promote the reforms to which
fl at im ntry is pledged by treaty with
th? fnited State.? and other powers.
There h;.s been a vigorous as??s tioii. ,
also, he says, of the equal right of
th- 1'nite i States to a voice in all j
questions pertaining to Chinese loans |
and devclopmenta.
President Taft make? the direct!
; t harg.. that th>- terrible evenl?

less loss of life, th-- devastatt jii oft

principal cities, the killings and the!

? In Central America the aim has j
