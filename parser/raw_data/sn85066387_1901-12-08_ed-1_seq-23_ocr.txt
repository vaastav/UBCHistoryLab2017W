' CALL. BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
'TT, WASHINGTON, Dec 7.— President
Roosevelt's remarks on the Monroe doc
trine In his nessage to Congress are re
garded here as an announcement that the
Monroe doctrine will hereafter be Inter
preted as discouraging and disfavoring
territorial aggrandizement by one repub
lic at the expense of another.
This Interpretation has aroused much
Interest among public men and diplomats,
and efforts have been made to ascertain
just what the President did mean by l^s
declaration.
"It is not." said a Cabinet officer, "a
declaration on the part of the President
that the United States will not permit any
aggression by any one American, power
upon territory of another. It Is" a declara
tion that this Government would regard
with great concern and great disfavor any
conquest cf an American power by an
cther American power. It does not mean
that the United States will form an alli
ance with a weaker power to prevent its
conquest with a stronger one."
Senator Lodge, a member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, who lis
tened to the statement, approved the in
terpretation given, adding, "The declara
tion simply repeats the traditional , and
uniform 'policy of this country. It Is nof
a new departure."
3oosevelt's Interpretation Hew.
Nevertheless, an examinaion of former
Presidents' messages shows no such in
terpretation as given by President Roose
velt. These positions have been hitherto
taken with respect to the Monroe doc
trine:
The declarations upon which Monroe
consulted Jefferson and his Cabinet relat
ed to the interposition of European pow
ers in affairs of American states.
The kind of interposition declared
against was that which may be made for
the purpose of controlling their political
affairs or cf extending to this hemisphere
the system In operation upon the conti
nent of Europe by which great powers
CSerclse control over the affairs of other
European states.
The declarations do not Intimate any
course of conduct to be pursued in case
cf such interposition, but merely say they
/ Tould be considered as dangerous to our
peace and safety, and as "manifestation
of an unfriendly disposition toward the
United States," which it would be im
possible for us to "behold with indiffer
ence," thus leaving the nation to act at
all times as Its opinion of Its policy or
duty might require.
The United States has never made any
alliance with or pledge to any other
American state en the subject corered by
the declarations.
No Prohibition by Monroe.
Declaration respecting non-colonization
was a subject distinct from European In
tervention with American states and re
lated to the acquisition of sovereign title
by any European power by new and orig
inal occupation or colonization. The
principle of public law upon which It was
placed was that the continent must be
considered as already within the occu
pation and jurisdiction of an Independent
civilized nation.
There Is nothing In the message of
President Monroe which refers in any
way to the relations of Spanish-American
states or the Imposition or any prohibi-
tion upon them to extend their respective
territories. President Monroe asserted
ltfat."it is stiil the true policy of the
Ty:ited States to leave the parties (Spain
and the South American States) to them
selves, In the hope that other powers will
pursue the same course."
President Grant, in his second annual
message, paved the way for President
Roosevelt's utterance by declaring that
"allied and other republics of Spanish
origin on this continent may see In this
fact a new proof of our sincere Interest
In their welfare, of our desire , to see
them blessed with good governments cap
able of maintaining order and of preserv
ing their respective territorial Integrity."
Little Bepublics Protest.
In Pan-American diplomatic circles
great importance Is attached to Roose
velt's declaration. One diplomat stated
that it meant nothing less than an" an
nouncement cf the purpose of the Wash
ington Government to direct the foreign
policies of the American republics.
"The Monroe doctrine," he said, "de
fined foreign policies of American repub
yc» crlth respect to Europe. The doctrine
pTSLauIgated by Roosevelt tells us that
we will not be allowed to take the fruits
of war provided they be in the shape of
territory. If Brazil and Argentina were
to become involved in a war under Roose
velt's policy the conqueror would'not be

REAR ADMIRAL SAMPSON
NOW CONSIDERED TO BE
IN VERY FEEBLE HEALTH
While There Has Been No Marked Change
His Chances for Withstanding Seri
ous Strain Are Slight.
ONE OF THE PRINCIPALS IN A CELEBRATED NAVAL CONTRO
VERSY WHOSE FAILING HEALTH. CONTINUES TO CAUSE GREAT
CONCERN AMONG HIS RELATIVES AND FRIENDS
WSHINGTON, Dec' 7.— It is
authoritatively stated that
there has been no marked
change for the worse In the
condition of Rear Admiral
'allowed to permanently occupy territory
of the conauered.
"In the case of Chile this is particularly
unjust. She is progressive and Industri
ous. Her country Is now too small for
her population and expansion Is necessary •
if she Is to become a great power. Presi
dent Roosevelt, however, steps in and
says she cannot acquire additional ter
ritory. Does his doctrine apply to the
Tacna-Arlca dispute? Is Chile to be com
pelled to surrender provinces which she
has held as compensation for her ex
penses during the war with Peru?
Permanence of Small Nations.
"Carrying out the policy of Roosevelt,
in case Costa Rica and Colombia become
Involved in war, an appeal from Costa
Rica will result in the Interference of
th« United States, because of Roosevelt's
purpose to secure the permanence of the
lesser among the new world of nations."
Senor Silva, the Colombian Minister,
said Roosevelt's declaration was certain
ly a new Interpretation of the Monroe
doctrine. "The Idea Roosevelt probably
had In mind," he continued, "was to dis
arm the suspicion unhappily harbored by
some South Americans that the United
States still contemplates expansion at the
expense of South American republics. He
undoubtedly designed to tighten the bonds
existing between Pan-American nations,
and to this end he gave utterance to
statements certain to inspire confidence
and trust in the country which has al
ways been our friend. Roosevelt's decla
ration is new, and it Is important, but I
am unable to state what Its effect will
be."

QUICK DROP IN SILVER
CAUSES A STAGNATION
Mexican Purchasers of United. States
Whei.t Are Sure to Be Heavy
• Losers.
AUSTIN, Tex., bee. 7.— It was stated
to-day by traffic officials of the Texas
railroads leading to the Mexican border
that the xeraarkable decline in Mexican
silver has caused almost a complete sus
pension of importations from the United
States into that country. Many large
orders for mining, agricultural and other
machinery placed in this country for
shipment to Mexico have been counter
manded. „
The droj> in the price of silver was so
sudden thl'it many of the Mexican pur-
Chasers of United States wheat will suf
fer heavy losses, as they bought the grain
on a gold iibligation and will have to sell
the product on a silver basis. No more
orders for wheat will be placed until the
situation Usiproves.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
GRASS VALLEY, Dec. 7.— Joseph Grif
fith, the Grass Valley citizen who disap
peared from his home on April 15 of this
year and was not heard from again there
after, was murdered, 'tils bodj^ was
found to-day at the bottom of an aban
doned mine shaft, where it had lain dur
ing all the months while the relatives of
the missing man were prosecuting an ex
haustive search for trace of him. To
night Charles Allen is in the custody of
the Sheriff, charged with the crime. It
was through a relative of his that the
body of the murdered man was recov
ered, its hiding place being revealed upon
the payment of a stated sum by the
widow.
This sordid desire for money may result
in the hanging of Griffith's slayer. Al
len's relative had asked what he might
expect if he showed the exact spot where
the body lay. He was offered $100, but
this was not enough. He demanded $200,
with $50 for the woman who gave him his
information. After consultation with the
widow of Griffith it was decided to pay
the man the sum he asked and all ar
rangements were made for the transfer
of the money upon the finding of the
body. " . > '.'■" ? ;■.'• .■ •,.•;■ !
Following the receipt of the money he
demanded the relative of Allen gave di
rections as to how the -body could be
found. The descent into the shaft was
made by William . Curry and John Hock
ing, who found the remains. The body
was covered with brush, tin- cans and
other refuse matt***- The head had been
severed. The body was fully clothed and
the clothing and shoes were recognized
by the relatives. The shaft was fifty feet
deep.
ylt was In Charles Allen's house that
Griffiths was last seen alive, and Mrs.
Allen's stories in relation to his visit
have been conflicting. To the members
of the missing man's family she said that
she had last seen Griffiths at' 7 o'clock on
the morning of April 15, while to Sheriff
Getcheil she said she had seen him at 4
o'clock that afternoon. Although . this
variation caused comment at the time, It
was not deemed of sufficient Importance
to connect the woman or her husband
with the disappearance. - ,
The secret of the crime came to light
through the women of the neighborhood
discussing it among themselves. At the
outset knowledge of the tragedy. was con
fined to two or three persons. One woman
confided in a friend, and in this manner
the facts came to the ears of Marshal
Deeble and John Hocking. Having as
their clew only a word dropped in an un
guarded moment they eventually came
to believe that Charles Allen had some
connection with the crime, and it was
while they were keeping him under sur
veillance that the offer to reveal the hid
ing place the body was made. The
shaft Into which the murdered man was
cast is back of Allen's house.
An inquest was commenced to-night,
Allen being the principal witness. He
denied guilt, but was very nervous.

HAY FLATLY REFUSES
TO DIVULGE SECRETS
OF STATE DEPARTMENT
Fruitless Attempt Is Made to Compel the
Secretary to Give Testimony in a
New York Libel Suit.
MEMBER OF THE CABINET WHO REFUSES TO BE BLUFFED BY AT
TORNEYS IN A LIBEL SUIT AND MAY ' BE CITED BY A NEW
YORK* JUDGE FOR CONTEMPT OF COURT.
_ __ -WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.— There
>\y\ / was an interesting; and un-
VLf yy usual proceeding to-day
» » the State Department, when
attorneys representing parties
to a New York lawsuit sought to compel
the testimony of Secretary Hay. The case
was an action for libel brought against a
New York newspaper by Carl Fischer
Hansen, a Danish banker; resident In New
York, and in it Is Involved Captain Dirk-
felt Christmas. These persons were said
to be interested as agents in the attempt
to sell the Danish West Indian islands to
the United Government, and the
publication which forms the basis for the
libel suit Is said to have, reflected oh their
competency. . .
, No Personal Knowledge.
Some days ago Secretary Hay had notlco
that his testimony had been called for
by the defense before the United States
Court in New York, and to-day Clarence
J. Hearn, counsel for the newspaper in
question, appeared at the State Depart
ment with United States Commissioner
Frank Blackistone of this, city, and a
stenographer. Robert Honey of New
York appeared as counsel ; for Hansen.
The parties were : received .by Secretary.
Hay in the diplomatic room, the Secretary
being accompanied by Judge j Penflcld,
solicitor for the State Department, as his
counsel. . /
The examination did not last long; in
fact, there was no examination In sub
stance. The counsel for the newspaper
attempted to propound some "questions
touching the 4 negotiations that occurred
between Secretary Hay and the Danish
agents In 1899-1900/ The Secretary flatly
refused to answer these and through
Judge Penneld announced his reasons for
doing so— that he had no personal knowl
edge of the . matters at issue. •■ Whatever
knowledge j he possessed had been ac
quired in his capacity of Secretary of
State, and' not ■ as an' individual. More
over, the information sought to be elicit
ed was a privileged communication to the
Government of , the United States and to
make this public would be highly preju
dlclal^to the Interests of the country. .
■May Be 1 Cited for Contempt..
Having formally noted the Secretary's
refusal and the character of his answer,
the Commissioner and counsel withdrew.
It is their purpose to state the facts to
the New York court, with a view to_hav
ing the Secretary of State brought before
that court on a charge of contempt.
It appears that the same parties have
examined or- sought to examine Senator
Lodge and Admiral Bradford, chief of the
Equipment Bureau of the Navy Depart
ment, who has had much to do with the
negotiations looking to' the acquisition of
coaling stations by the United States
Government.
It Is gathered that neither of these wit
nesses gave *• any j testimony material to
the suit, Senator Lodge, It is said, never
having, heard of Hansen, and Admiral
Bradford being acquainted with none of
the facts sought to be developed by the
defense as bearing upon the alleged libel.
Secretary Hay had had very little to
Jo wit^ the parties in this case. He saw
Captain Christmas for about five minutes
on the occasion, of the officer's visit to
Washington,- but Hansen he ■ does not
know. The officials of the State Depart
ment feel secure in their position in re
sistance " to the court's order, finding
strong precedent for It in a controversy
that "arose . between President Jefferson
and 'Chief Justice Marshall over a similar
application for a mandamus. '•

TO BE RUN
California Gas and Elec
tric Company Will
/ Control.
Giant Corporation Will Make
Rapid Transit the First
Object
Surveying Party Already in the Field
to Establish Lines for the
Transmission <A*
Power.
The recently incorporated California Gaa
and Electric Company, with its capitaliza
tion of $30,000,000, is well on the way to
ward the consummation of a deal that
means the speedy development of Marln
County as a suburban residence section
and probably its ultimate connection with
the counties to the north and east DV a
network of electric railroads. The young
giant of California corporations will ab
sorb the North Pacific Coast Railroad,
commonly known as the "narrow gauge
road," and will at once convert it into an
electric road. Fast ferry-boat service will
be supplied, and the residents of San Ra
fael, Ross Station, Mill Valley and other
favorite town in California's "Switzer
land" will be given up-to-date rapid tran
sit, with electric cars or trains of cars
running as close together as the patron
age will Justify.
Papers will be filed within a few days
that will insure the control of the rail
road by the Interests dominant in the
new electric light and power corporation.
Already a surveying party is in the field,
having started from San Rafael, to es
tablish the most practicable lines for tha
transmission of power from the Yuba and
other sources controled formerly by the
Bay Counties Power Company and the
California Central Gas and Electric Com
pany, now merged Into one and strength
ened by the union of Eastern with Cali
fornia capital.
Electricity to Be Motive Power.
The entire railroad, from Sausalito to
San Rafael and San Quentln, from tha
junction to Mill Valley, and from San
Anselmo northward some eighty miles to
Cazadero, will be converted Into an elec
tric railway. First attention, of course,
will be directed to giving the section pop
ulated by San Franciscans, who have
built country homes among the redwoods
of Marin, the best possible service, with
fast boats making numerous trips and
comfortable ' electric cars or trains run
ning at short intervals and carrying the
commuters to and from their homes with
out the vexatious delays and discomforts
and great waste of time that have oper
ated to check the development of & re
gion fitted by nature to be the Ideal of
suburban residence districts.
Sausalito, Corte Madera, Ross station.
Mill Valley, San Rafael— all these and
others have climate and natural beauty.
Beautiful country homes have been built
on oak-studded hillsides and In shady,
canyons. Farther up the railroad are
dozens of popular summer resorts. To
all— the residence towns and resorts—the
conversion of tha antiquated narrow
gauge road into a modern electric railway
means a new era. And by San Francis
cans who have homes In Marln tha news
of the prospective change will be re
ceived Joyfully.
Extension to Petaluma.
The first extension of tributary lines,
reaching Into the territory In which tha
new corporation controls the power and
lighting systems, -will be from San Rafael
to Petaluma. It 13 understood that one
of the duties of the surveying party now
in the field is to make a preliminary sur
vey for such a line.
Some of the leading men among the
California stockholders of the new Cali
fornia Gas and Electric Company are
among the heavy stockholders of the
North Pacific Coast Railroad. J. C. Cole
man Is a director, and one of the large
stockholders of the railroad, and he has
already subscribed $30,000 in the stock of
the new corporation.
The p^clse nature of the deal Is still
kept secret between the two corporations.
It is believed, however, that enough pur
chases of stock have been made, together
with the affiliation of certain stockhold
ers of the railroad with the new corpora
tion, to give the gas and electric company
interests complete control. A change in
management will be involved and the
smaller stockholders who recently ; tried
to oust J. B. Stetson from his position of
president and general manager will now
doubtless have their wishes gratified. The
reorganized road will of necessity be
placed under the management of a man
familiar with the operations of electric
railroads.
The Nor^h Pacific Coast Railroad is
owned practically by ten stockholders,
four of whom have the large part of the
15,000. shares of the corporation's stock.
These are J. B. Stetson. Antoine Borel,
John C. Coleman and the Parrott estate.
Borel has not been friendly to the Stet
son management and his encouragement
and support and Coleman's Interest In the
new gas and electric corporation have
doubtless been* Important factors In tha
deal that will end in the absorption of
