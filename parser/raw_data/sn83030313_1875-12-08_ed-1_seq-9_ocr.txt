McDonald was put behind iho Jail bars in default of a

able by many. Bis evident partiality In tbe
administration of Justice has had the effect
to arouse some sympathy for McDonald,
and to produce the Impression that Judge Treat intends
to grant the motion for a new trial now pending In
Avery's case. District Attorney Dyer and Mr. Hender

supposed the subject of the conference was Babcock.

FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.
Wamiiinutok, Dec. 7, 1875.
COMMENTS ON THE MESSAGE BI DEMOCBATS
AND REPUBLICANS AND THE MILITARY.
The comments on the Message are various, but there
la a concurrence of opinion that It Is a ghrowd but very
tedious document The Cuban passages have excited
tome surprise. A democratic Senator remarked:
"The President repeals almost literally the language
and exactly the sentiments of his special Cuban
Mossago of 1870, and nobody can deny that he is
right. The singular fact about it is that he was certainly
a month ago determined to make a fuss with Spain, and
1 suspect that tho Spaniards have taken the alartn in
time and have comu forward with suggestions and
propositions of their own, which were of such a nature
as to make it indecent for the President to push
Spain "
A republican remarked:?
"Tho Message IB singular for lis omissions. It has
not a word for two of the most notable events of the
year, the discovery of the whiskey frauds, which form
the most extensive conspiracy against tho revenue
Known In our history, and the exposure of tho Indian
ring."
"It is the first Message in which General Grant has
said nothing of the condition of the South," said a
democrat, who was ono of the company.
"He bows himself out gracefully In tho allusion to this
being his last Message," said a republican, but bo was
answered,
"Yes, and makes a bid for a third term In the refer
ence to the schools."
"If you democrats are wise," said a prominent repub
lican, who is not a third termer, "you will make haste
to adopt an amendment about school funds, and thus
take that question out of politics. The President has the
sympathy of the country on that question, and if be
means third terra he has taken the only ground upon
which he can got it If he got the nomination on that
platform he would go In by a swinging majority. If
you want to kill off the third term I advise you to
adopt an amendment on the subject at once and tuko
the question out of current politic*. You can pet it
through tho legislatures thU winter, lor nobody will
oppose It."
This suggestion was well received by the little com
pany in which It was made, most of whom were firmly
persuaded that the President meant third term
Indeed, this seems to be the general impression here
among the members of both parties.
In regard to the Cuban passages, the general Impres
sion is that the Message protests too much. "If there
was really no change why take so many words to say
It; If ho meant nothing why say so much ?" ig the re
mark. But there is also a general feeling, often expressed
by men of both parties, that while Mr. Ftoh remains In the
State Department no Ill-judged or hxsty policy will be
taken !n any of our foreiirn relations. The Secretary of
State has won the confidence of tho leading and most
responsible men of both sides.
Great curiosity Is felt by many to know what is to be
the tenor of the additional note whiph the
President promises In relation to Cuban affairs
On the other hand, soino army and navy ofticers ex' '
pressed publicly this evening in the hotels their disap j
pointment at the peaceful tenor of the Message, and ono j
ot the shoulder strap statesmen gave It as his opinion !
that only a foreign war could bring the North and South
together amicably. The substance of the Cuban passages '
in the Message was cabled to Madrid to night.
THB CHICAGO WHISKEY BINO?THE REMOVAL
OF DISTBICTS ATTORN ST WARD AND THE
CHARGES AGAINST HIM?STARTLING DEVELOP- '
MENTS PROMISED.
The removal ofDistrict Attorney Ward, of Chicago, is
a very significant movoment The Treasury Depart- ?
ment has been convinced for some time past that the
Chicago Whiskey King is quite as extensive and em
braces even more ofllcials of one grade or another 1
than the Ring which has been uncovered at '
St Louis For many weeks past there has
been reason to suspect that Mr. Ward was not suf- !
flciontly active in tho fulfilment of his duties; that for
some reason suits which ought to have been pressed i
vigorously were allowed to stand still, and that the
Ring frauds were not uncovered. It was
also noticed that tho Grand Jury did not ap
pear to have full evidence In several case*
which It had tinder Investigation. Within 1
a few days the facts of the situation have become lully
known here. Hon. Benton C. Cook, of Chicago, ar
rived here some days ago, and went directly to the
President and laid before him such evidences of Mr.
Ward's friendship for or weak subservience to the King
as determined the President to remove him at once. The
Attorney General was Instructed to demand his immedi- |
ate resignation. The charges made againtt him here are 1
thai he has been acting In the Interest of the Ring so
far as he dared; that he has withheld evidence and has 1
exerted anything but a wholesome Influence over tho
Grand Jury. He Is also accused of having an interest |
In a large malthonse. The Information brought to the
President also shows clear tracos of a whiskey ring in
Chicago equalling, ind probably rivalling in the magni
tude of its operations, the one discovered In St. I.oui.i
With a new District Attorney, a vigilant and skilful [
man, in Chicago, there Is reason to anticipate some
startling exposures there within a short time.
FROM OUR REGULAR CORRESPONDENT.
Washington, Dec. 7, 1873.
THE BEADING OF THE MESSAGE IN THE SEN
ATE.
Nothing of Importance transpired In the Senate to
day beyond the reading of the President's Message, j
When Its arrival wag announced a look of anxious cu
riosity appeared on the faceg of those seated In the j
galleries. They expected to see General Babcock, but
were disappointed. Mr. Luckey, wboae name has also
been published in connection with the St. l.ouls whig,
key Irauds, was the bearer or the Impor
tant document, another copy of which he delivered
to the House. All eyes were turned toward the door
and there was a general smlla when he entered with
one of the doorkeepers. The spectators listened to the
reading of the Message with unusual attention, but ;
gome of the Senators did not manifest much Interest in
II until the clerk reached that part which refers to edu
cation, polygamy and the taxation af church
property. Senators Morton, Conklltg and Fro- 1
lingbuysen gave the closest attention to the read
ing, which wss indistinct snd bard to understand
even near the Pregidcnt'a degk. One of the
New England members went to aleep and two other* |
spent the hour in writing letters. It was evident that
the ciaunes above referred to made a deep impression, '
aud, at; lha closing paragraphs were read, a whisper '
went around that the Message wns a regular campaign !
document lor the third term. Some spoke of it as the
ablest Message the President had ever written.
Conspicuous in the diplomatic gallery were Sir Ed
ward lUmuum the Ur t|?b M m^ter^and >1 rt>. pjid fljss
Kish. Sir Kdward put hi* band behind hia ear tail
showed marked interest in the passages relating to the
Alabama claims and Cuban and Mexican matters, aad
when it was seen that the Presideut was for peaeo,
everybody seemed to breathe freer.
JOY AT THE 81'AN I.Sit LEGATION?THE INFLU
ENCE OF THIS HERALD AH BEOABDED Bt 'run
DIPLOMATS.
The .Spanish legation and diplomatic circle* generally
are auilling and joyous to night, a sense of great relief
from a prolonged suspense being experienced since the
?xact teaor of President Grant's news on Cuba have
become known through his Message to Congress. The
diplomats say that Crant's expressions are almost a
paraphrase of the edit?cv?l article In the Hkrai.i> of No
vember 25, 1875, and, with much amusement amid the
quailing of many a glass of rosy wine, the conquering of
the Preaidnnt'a well known bellicose propensity and dis
position In Cuban affairs is freely attributed to the firm
articles of the Hkiuld reviewing the subject, ajid the
Hkkalo is toasted gratefully among them. Mr Fish is
also regard*-1 as having triumphed over the President's
obstinacy, aided by tbe legal advisers of his Cabinet
family, who look solely a severe legal view of the
question.
WALL STREET ItEPBESENTATrVES LISTENrNQ TO
THE If K.S.SAO E ? A HAD DISAPPOINTMENT.
Perhaps the most deeply Interested listeners in the
galleries were a deputation of Wall street men, among
them Jake Rubino, well known as Daniel Drew's agent
and broker. It was a enrious sight to walch this party.
As the Message progressed they manifested great mi
patience at the President's lengthy reference to the ad
vent or the Uenteunial year of the Republic. They
wanted to get to the Cuban war portion
right away. The long disquisition on free
schools and church taxation tried them still
more. But they pricked up their ears when they heard
the words "Mr. Cushing," "Madrid," Ac., and they
protruded their bodies over the ledge or the gallery in a
way that threatened to give them the privileges of the
floor In a very expeditious manner. They absorbed
ovory word of the argument greedily, and when they
saw, at length, that recognition of Cuba was uol in the
Presidential mind, they consoled themselves with the
thought, "Well, he's going to give Cuba belligerent
rights anywuy," and they listened still. But their
hopes were destinod to fresh and sadder disappoint
ment Belligerent rights were also out of the question.
Tho clerk read, on and their ears caught the words
"Mediation and Intervention."
"Now we have It," they said. "He Is going to
recommend armed Intervention, and that's the mean
Ing or fitting out the navy."
But this anticipation was also fallacious. The Mes
sage was the mildest mannered sort or a document,
and the President the most peaceable of citizens, in
stead of the one being a red rag to the Spanish bull
and the other a bloodthirsty filibuster. Jake Rubino
rested bis head on his baud a minute and said?but per
haps it is better to leave his remark unrepealed. It
was not a cheerful remark, and it was never learned at
Dauiel Drew's seminary. Suffice it to say that "Jakey"
and his compatriots from Wall street were dumb
rounded, and slowly made thoir exit from the gallery,
wondering at the mys.teries of statecraft in general
and at the diablerie of tirantism in particular. Tho
great American community may safely invest their
bottom greenback in a wager that "Jakey" and his
cunjrkret will bo found in the foremost ranks of the
enemies of a third term.
THE MEHSAGE ON THE TAXATION OF CHURCH
PROPERTY?THE AMOUNT HELD BT THE VA
RIOT'S DENOMINATIONS.
In connection with tho portion of tho President's
Messago rocommending the taxation of all church prop
erty throughout the country without exception, the
puoltc will be Interested In knowing the umount of
property hold 'oy each or tho different religious denomi
nations In the year 1S70, when the last national census
was taken. It will be seen that the blow the Presi
dent aims at sectarianism would fall most heavily on
his own denomination?the Methodist?and that he
has greatly exaggerated tho amount of church prop
erty held by the different sects unless, as is
quit# Improbable, the total of $354,483,581, which,
according to the census, they owned In 1870,
has trebled In the Interval of tbe past five years. This
total was divided up as follows:? I
Methodists . $60 854 l**i I
Roman Catholics .7. V. t>o'98.".'o5? I
Presbyterians 63.2061266
Baptists. 41,d08,198 '
Episcopalians 36,514,549
Congregationalists 26,069 608
Reformed Church 16,'134'470
Lutherans I4'9|;'74j
The remaining $35,000,000 being distributed between
seventeen other denominations. That these figures are
correct is vouched for in a note at tbe foot or tho table
in the printed compendium or the census, reading as
follows:?
Tbe statistics of churches are believed to be scbstan- !
tialiy exact and to present a just view or the orgiiniza- !
tion ol tho several religious denomination*"found i
within the United States.
It Is a coincidence that the Roman Catholics, who
number Just about one soventh or the population of the j
country, are credited in the census with possessing j
Just one seventh of the church property in the United
Stales.
THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT?AN" INDIAN COM- '
MISSlONER FOUND AT LAST?REFORMS IN
AL'OURATED BY SECRETARY CHANDLER.
Secretary Chandler has at last round a Commissioner
or Indian Affairs. Mr. John Q. Smith, or Ohio, who >
has to day acceptcd the place, was a member of the last
Congress, where ho made a good reputation as a clear
headed, firm and independent man. Tho selection Is
thought here to bean admirable one, and the Secretary
is congratulated upon his success.
Mr. Chandler has already removed nearly hair ihe I
clerks in the Indian Bureau, and will now commence a
thorough work or reform in the general Indian service.
As a beginning he yesterday made an order that:
Hereafter no payment ahall bo made and no claim
shall be approved for services rendered for or in behalf
of any tribe or band of Indians in the procurement of
legislation from Congress or from any Slate Legislature,
or lor tho transaction of any other business tor or in
behalf of such Indians before ibis department or any
bureau thereof or beforo any other department of the
government, and no contract lor the performance of
such services will hereafter be recognized or approved
by the Indian Olllce or the department. Should legal
advice or assistance be needed in the prosocutiun or de
fence of any suit involving the rights ol any Indian or
Indians, before any court or other tribunal, it can be
procured through the Department of Jusiico.
This regulation will govern the Indian Office, and ap
plication lor compensation for such services ii.uhi nut
be forwarded to the department for action herealter
it being understoo 1 thai the regularly appointed Indian
Agent, the Commissioner of ludian Affairs and the
Secretary ol the Interior are com[x>tenl to protect and
defend tho rights of Indians in all respects without
the intervention of other parties, and without other
compensation than tbe usual salaries of their respective
otllccs. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
Z. CHANDLER, Secrclarv.
To the ComnssioMRR of Indian Akpaikh.
This slops one of the grossest abuses connected with
the Indian service. Kvery winter rorty or fifty lobby
ists come here and besiege Congress and the Depart
ment or the Interior, under pretence of having different
interests of Indian tribes to guard or advance under
aomo special coniracl with the Indiana. There has
been Tor some time before the Interior Department one
euch case, a claim for $180,000 for professional services,
said to have beeu rendered to certain Indians during
Mr. Johnson's administration in 1868. A aalu
of about $13,500.000 of Indian lands Vras made to cer
tain railroad companies for twelve and a half cents per
aero. Some lawyers thereupon bargained with the In
dians that they would have the sale rescinded and ibey
would obtain for them a higher price on the land in
consideration of fifty per cent or the higher price for
their professional services. They assert that ihvj got
the President tofescind tbe treaty ui.der wLich the saie
was made, and then got Congress to order a new Kile
at $1 25 per acre, and for this they fput in a claim tor
about $4,000,000. This was too big a sum. and they
Bnally agreed to take $230,000, if they could get it. and
actually received $60,000. Secretary Chandler's order
shuts out this and other claims ol the same kind.
THE INDICTMENT OF BABCOCK A FACT?HE
DECLINES TO BE INTERVIEWED.
Notwithstanding the earnest and repeated denials
here and at St. Louie that General Babeock was uot
indicted last week by the Grand Jury, as reported in
the 11 skald, It la true he was indicted on Friday,
December 6th. He left for tho West
this evening 10 appear before the military
commission. Fearing that he might be misinterpreted,
and consequently misunderstood, he declined to be in
terviewed or to make any statement! or explanations

grams, and the President is perfectly satisfied that the
Integrity of General Babcock's oflict.il and personal
character is in no way injured. The Attorney Gen

reason tbat as bo is a representative of the prosecu
tion in case an indictment should be found b* did

a solution of the telegrams out of which the charges
appear to have arisen.

At a quarter past one P. M. Mr. Luckey, private sec
retary to the President, appeared at the bar of the
Senate with the Message, and it was read by Mr. Gor
barn, Secretary of the Senate.
The reading of the Message was concluded at eight

welt as by a large audionce in tho galleries. Sir Ed
ward Thornton, the British Minister, was sealed Id tho

ested in the reading. The portions of tho Message in

HOUSE OF . REPRESENTATIVES.
Washington, Dec. 7, 1875.
Mr. Blaixk, (rep.) of Me., rising to a personal ex
planattou, said that In tbo debato yesterday on the
Louisiana question be bad expressed the hope that
the other sitle of the House would not In an in
cidental way attempt to reopen and dishonor
the agreement made last year. Some persons
had Imagined that the word "dishonored" bad been
used by bun with some desire to Impute it to the gen
tleman from Mississippi (Mr. L&inar) as a personal
affront. He had uaed it only in the sense of nullifying
and disregarding, and not with the remotest idea of
offering an affront to tbat gentleman. Ho (Mr. Lamar)
kucw that if their relations were not intimate, they
bad been nothing else than entirely cordial at all limes,
and thai It must be farthest from his design at any
lime lo say anything to him wounding or otherwise
disagreeable to his feelings.
Mr. Iiamak, idem.) of Miss., said that he bad not
heard the word which the gentleman from Maine was
reported as having used, and that oven if be had heard
ll he would have believed that it had dropped irom him
inadvertently in the heat of debate, for he believed that
guntleman incapable of offering a gratuitoua insult to
hunseif or any other gentleman. He accepted ibe ex
planation in tbe generous spirit in which it was made.
Tbe House then, on motion of Mr Kanhai.l, look a
recess till one o'clock, that being ibe hour fixed for the
drawitig of seats.
The recess was still further extended in order to give
tbe three member* who were ubsent on tbe committee
lo wail u|>on the President, Messrs. Cox, of New York,
Knott, of Kentucky, and Blaine, of Maine, an oppor
tunity to b? prenem and select their scats when their
names should be called.
Tbe usual courtesy of allowing the oldest continuous
member to select a seat in advance of the draw ing was
extended to Mr. Kelley, of Pennsylvania, and a mem
bcr was also permitted lo select a seal for Mr. Stephens,
of Georgia.
At a quarter past one P M . Mr Cox, of New York,
reported thai tho committee bad waited upon tbe
President, and that a communication in writing would
bo sent to the House forthwith.
The Sp&akkr thereupon submitted the question to
the House whether it would proceed now to the draw
ing of seuts or have the President's Message road.
The former course determined upon and tho
drawing lor scats proceeded, a blindfolded page draw
ing iho names of members from a box, one by one, and
the members so drawn coming from outside the bar
where all were congregated and occupying ibe seal
which he proposed holding for the Congress.
The tirst name drawn was that of Mr. Whltehouse, of
New York, and among ibe next half dozen were those
of Mr. Hoar, of Massaahusetis, Mr. Ely, of Now York,
aud Mr. K.ng, of-Minnesoia.
The democratic members took their seats on the ea?t
side of the Chamber, lo the right of tbe Speaker's
chair, the fame aide which they have partially occupied
for many Congresses past. Some or them, however,
including Messrs. Wood and Ely, of New York, selected
seats on tbo western or republican side of the Cham
ber.
Mr. Banks selected the seat which he formerly occu
pied to the extreme left, resisting the invitation of Mr.
I'.l&ine to lake a seal near him, aud intimating that iho
atmosphere about there was too strong for h.m.
It was twenty minutes past two when the drawing
for seats was completed, and as soon as order was re
stored Ibe President's Message was received and pre
sented to the House ar.d rend It il:e reading clerk, Mr
M chaffy.
Tbe reading of the Megsar* occupied two hours and
five minutes. At lirsi it aas listened to aub consider
able interest and attention, but after the clerk
baa got pus I these portions of tt relating
lo education, Church property and Cn'?a.
attention began to flag. Members gradually left their
teals, retinue to the cloak rooms or sweding in io?
ai-ies engaced it'f conversation w th earh other -so
that during the laier hall of the Message Uero '^re
probably nol forty members In their *oais. aud bnyiewr
(?f tbosc paying tbe slightest attention lo it Intact,
were ii rol for the tones of tha Clerk's voire, ?h cU^-re
heard above ltd din on the Boor, it might have, been
supposed that the House was indulging m a rweii.
The Message was ordered printed.
Mr. Cox, of New York presented a pellt'ojyof W H.
Tresentt ar.d others, of South Carolina, with, VeferMce
lo the right of representation ef the Thi# Congres
sional district of South Carolina, and uwvnaLthal n Nj

that ol a representative as it wa? oi a *?pJT*eaaatton.
The petition was so referred.
The House then, at half past four'o'clock, a^Joorned
