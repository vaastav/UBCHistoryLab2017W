(Copyright. 1900, hy New York Evening Telegram,)
Spools! Dispatch to The Star.
NEW YORK. December 6.?Scandals In
high places, criminal prosecutions and suits
by the t'nlted States government to recover
lands worth hundreds of millions of dollars
are now certain to result from investigations
concerning the relations of the Harri
man and Gould railroads to the coal Industry
of the west.
Today Is published for the first time testimony
of a startling nature taken before the
Interstate commerce commission at Omaha.
Penver and Salt I-ake, before the present
hearing at SaU I>ake began, and which has
Pince been suppressed by order of the commission.
It was the purpose of this testimony to
>lm? that the T'nion Pacific railroad and
the Rio Grande Western acquired thousands
of acres of valuable coal lands from
the government by fraudulent means. Already
the government has sued to recover
part of this land, and still other and more
Important proceedings are to come, which.
It Is believed, v.lll lead to one of the greatest
legal battles In which Vhe government
has ever engaged.
In addition, the revelations already have
led to the finding of several indictments by
a grand jury at Salt Lake. They include
charges against the general land office and
two I'nited States senators, and influenced
President Roosevelt to recommend that the
governfnent coal lands be permanently withdrawn
from settlement.
Land Office Involved.
Witnesses huve charged the general land
office anil Senators Warren and Clark of
Wyoming with complicity In Wyoming land
frauds, and much of the most important
testimony regarding the Illegal acquisition
of land by the Harriman interests was
wrung by the commission's lawyers from
D. O. Clark, superintendent of the Union
Pacific's main subsidiary coal company and
a brother of Senator Clark.
Ainonir the witnesses was Soeci&l Aeent
MeyendorfT. who was engaged in an investigation
under Secretary Hitchcock.
He declared that after he had unearthed
the land frauds Senator Warren had
warned him that he had incurred the enmity
of the Union Pacific and tried to intv>
otnn ffriA ln?nalUn?i/.n ? ? J
uuvc i i nil IU diuji Hit ntYvou(,,uiuii aim
leave 'he stat*. as his inquiries might
bring about the defeat of Senator Clark.
Hefusing to yield, he was suspended and
afterward transferred to L?os Angeles.
Meyendorff made oath that he was Instructed
to destroy affidavits against the
Union Pacific, and that evidence was suppressed
in the land office under Commissioner
W. A. Richardson of Wyoming.
Other special agents gave similar testl
mony. B lager Hermann, fonnerly commissioner
who has be?-n Indicted, Is also
affected by the charges.
High-Handed Methods.
In addition to acquiring the coal lanc.8
fraudulently and In pursuance of a plan
to gain an absolute monopoly of the coal
trade west of the Mississippi, the railroads.
according to the evidence produced, adopted
various high-handed methods to maintain
that monopoly. It has been shown
that freight rates were manipulated to
force Independent mine owners to sell their
properties to hirelings of the roads and to
prevent other operator* from opening coal
mines. Witnesses have testified that thugs
were employed by the railroad companies
to drive settlers from coal lands.
The Investigations have developed three
different lines along which the government
will proceed against the railroads. The
most important of these will be for the land
frauds, but prosecutions for violations of
the rate law and for combinations in restraint
of trade will be pushed vigorously.
It is charged that the coal famine now ex
istin* in Utah and other far western states
is traceable directly to the policy pursued
by the railroads to keep Independent operators
out of the field. I
The Government Coal Lands.
There is no doubt that a special report to
President Roosevelt from the interstate
commerce commission Influenced the President
to order a temporary withdrawal of
coal lands from public entry, and subsequently
to recommend in his message to
Congress that the government should hereafter
retain all of its coal land. It Is the
opinion of the commission that there are
still from fifty to sixty million acres of
such government land, and that about, onetenth
of this land contains bituminous coal
of fine quality. It is proposed that these
lanas De leased Dy the government ana
worked on a royalty basis.
Feeling Between Departments.
By extending the scope of its investigation
to an inquiry concerning the means by
which the railroad acquired certain of its
coal lands, the interstate commerce commission
has aroused bitter feeling in the Department
of the Interior, which for some
time has been conducting an inquiry of its
own along similar lines, but secretly and
with every precaution to keep the results of
its proceedings from reaching the public.
While the commission has not been turned
from its purpose by the attitude of the Interior
Department, the public, by a recent
ruling, has been denied access to the great
mass of early testimony taken at widely
separated places and never published. Part
of this withheld testimony contains grave
revelations.
By what is known as the Tillman-Gillespie
resolution, the interstate commerce commission
was authorized to investigate the relation
of railroads with the business of transportation.
mining and handling coal. When
the inquiry began to touch upon the methods
by which the Union Pacific acquired its
coal lands, objection was made by counsel
of the company on the ground that testimony
it was desired to produce had been
previously thrashed out by the land department,
which decided against the land
claimants in favor of the railroad company,
and that the matter should not acaln he en
tercd into.
Discrimination in Oil Kates.
This objection was repeated in an effort
to keep out evidence regarding discrimination
in oil rates at Evanston, Wyo., counsel
for the railroad company Insisting that
this line ?I inquiry should be barred because
claimants to oil land at Evanston, in
contests with the company, had been refused
title by a decision of the Secretary of
the Interior, who held that no oil existed
there In paying quantities. These protests
were overruled by the commission, and in
the latter rase witnesses testified that thev
had oil wells at Evanston which produced
abundant quantities of the most valuable
oil found In the United States, oil of the
same quality as that produced at Baku,
Russia, and not known to exist anywhere
In the world except there and Evanston.
They declared that freight rates were so
high as to make It impossible for them to
ship even this oil profitably, and that the
company refused to make any rates on refined
oil.
Never on the Land.
But the most sensational testimony presented
related to the coal-land frauds. It
was shown that employes of the Union'
Pacific company had hired large numbers
or men in uenver 10 sign ueciaratory
statements which were filed on thousands
of acres in Sweetwater county in Wyoming,
each man also signing at the same time a
relinquishment of claim in blank.
These men, according to their own statements
on the stand, had never been on the
land, they were never sworn as the law requires,
although the oaths, duly attested,
appear of record, and many were not aware
of the nature of the papers they signed.
They were paid $3 or $4 each for their part
in this transaction. These declaratory
statements were filed at the land office In
Wyoming and their effect was to keep other
claimants off the land until prospectors for
the railroad company should be able to
make thorough examination and determine
which pieces were valuable for coal and
consequently worth taking up.
Testimony was given to show that the
quarter seo-iuna iuuiiu 10 contain coaj were
later entered by other employes of the road,
who paid the government prices, $20 an
acre, with money furnished by the Union
Pacific upon the understanding that they
were to transfer the land to an agent of
the company, a proceeding which Is contrary
to law. In nearly every case the
dummy purchaser received $200 to give the
transaction the appearance of a bona-Ade
sale.
A Judge Interested.
une u 1 me men wno maue casn entry
upon a quarter section upon which a declaration
and a relinquishment signed in
Denver had previously been filed was
Cyrus Heard, now one of the Justices of
the supreme court of Wyoming, then a
local attorney for the railroad company.
On the witness stand before the com
mission Judge Beard declared that he did
not know what he had done was illegal.
He had never been on the land and
was therefore unable, when he made the
entry, to testify to the land office that
the property contained coal. As this testimony
is required by law. It was furnished
by D. O. Clark, vice president and general
manager of the Lnion Pacific Coal Company.
and also superintendent of service of
the Union Pacific Railroad Company, who
acted as his agent in that behalf.
Judge Beard borrowed the money, about
*1,200. to pay the government fee, from
George Black, superintendent of the Union
Pacific Coal Company, which Is owned by
the railroad. The Superior Coal Company,
another subsidiary of the Union Pacific,
now controls the property.
After Judge Beard gained possession
from the government Black, as his agent,
sold the land to Vice President Clark, to
whom nearly all the other purchasers
deeded their land, Black having previously
furnished each one the purchase price,
$3,200, as he did to Judge Beard.
Like the others. Judge Beard received
$200 advance over the purchase price, but
unlik. many of the witnesses who were
heard, he insisted that there had been no i

there is no doubt that the shah is attacked
by Bright's disease, and the complications
which have supervened lately are the result
of the ever-Increasing impermeability
of the kidneys. TWs attack of Bright's
disease Is the result oT""gravel. from which
the shah has suffered a long time and for
which he took several "cures" at Contrex
ville.
Dr. Lindley, following the old principle,
put his majesty on a milk diet. Prof.
Damsch of Gottlngen has completely reversed
the preceding treatment, and has
advised him to talTe as mucn nourishment

In Bright's disease a milk diet is useful
as lon-g as the water eliminated in twentyfour
hours is small in quantity and as longas
general nutrition Is satisfactory. When
the water eliminated augments, and when
general nutrition Is unsatisfactory, it may
be very useful to change the mode of
nourishment and insist on the patient taking
substantial food.
In this case it is necessary to favor the
elimination of water by means of medicines.

remedy is abandoned the moment water is

Can Hardly Recover.
in view or tne point reacnea Dy tne disease
from which the shah Is suffering It Is
hardly probable that he will recover. His
life may be prolonged, thanks to the treatment
of which he Is the object, but one
ought always to fear the sudden appearance
of complications, such as "texeomia"
or "uraemia," which Is likely to carry him
off very rapidly.
The only surgical intervention poss'ble
in these affections Is practiced on the lower
extremities. By means of a lancet very
flne incisions are made and the dropsical
liquid is drawn off. This operation Is not
without danger, for little wounds thus
made may become inflamed and a source
of infection. Just as danarerous as the
dropsy.

Beware of Medical Novelties.
| This unfortunate eVent demonstrates
once more how necessary it is to be on

the general consent of the majority of
practitioners.
The public has a strong tendency toward

The shah Is not the first victim of the
nmnia for systematizing. Milk diet Is

turned the city over to the Chinese, and
that the Chinese flag has been hoisted over
the public buldings. New Chwang had been
held by the Japanese since the beginning of j
the war with Russia.
TOKIO. December 6.?The retrocession of
Yinkow. the port of New Chwang, yesterday
morning completed the retrocession to
China of all the Chinese cities taken poss28sion
of by the Japanese in the course of
their military operations in Manchtiria.
Commenting upon this, the newspapers
find that the only explanation of Russia's I
I continued occupation of North Manchuria |
is that Li Hung Chang sold Manchuria to j
Russia while he was in attendance upon
the czar's coronation in Moscow in 18i>5.
Chtna, they say, has recovered South Manchuria
only in consequence of Japan's disinterestedness
and her high sense of justice,
which makes China's recent objections to
the manner of the restoration extremely
ungracious. Chinese integrity, the newspapers
declare, is threatened only from
within.
Japan's next budget is roughly estimated
at 580,4HHMWO yen ((fcSXl.OfXHKN)), an increase
of 80,000,<XI0 yen. It has been decided not
to have recourse to increased taxation or
new loans. The present surplus of 57,(XK>,?K)
yen, augmented from established resources,
will, it is believed, be Quite sufficient.
WILLPREPAYINTEREST
SECRETARY SHAW TO RELIEVE
THE MONT2Y MARKET.
The Secretary of the Treasury has given
notice to the holders of United States bonds
that the interest maturing on the several int^rpst
flntpc hptwppn nnrl innlu/Hno' Tflnnnrv
1 and May 1, 1907, will be prepaid without
rebate on and after December 15, 1006.
Cheeks for the interest due January 1, litO",
on registered bonds will be mailed to the
owners on or before the 15th instant. The
amount of interest which may thus be prepaid
is nearly $12,Of*),000.
In anticipating this payment Secretary
Shaw stated that he was influenced by the
iuci ui;ii wie treasury coiiecieu surplus revenues
amounting to $7,000,000 in the month
of November and that the current month is
also likely to be a month of surplus receipts.
In December, the surplus receipts were
five and one-half millions. The action taken,
therefore, releases for use in the business
of the country a sum practically equal to
the surplus receibts for November and De
cember. In the present activity of business
the Secretary said he was unwilling to permit
the operations of this department to aggravate
present conditions in the money
market. It was thought best to anticipate
two quarterly payments at one time, as in
this way holders of registered bonds will
only be obliged to send the bonds to the
treasury to be stamped once Instead of
twice.
NO NEW TREATY WITH JAPAN.
Humor in Circulation Officially Set at
Best.
Inquiry disclosed the fact that the legal
proceedings to be taken in San Francisco
by the United States district attorney, in
the matter of the admission of Japanese
to the public schools of that city without
discrimination, were inspired by Secretary
Root, who expressed the opinion that it

That the President's views on the subjust
meet with the hearty approval of the
Japanese government was made evident
yesterday when Viscount Aokl, the Japanese
ambassador, said that he had personally
thanked the President for what he
had said.
A rumor that a new treaty between the
United States and Japan was to be negotintorl

the one now in force, was set at rest when
both Viscount Aoki and Secretary Root unequivocally
denied that such a thing even

SI* Firms Homeless.
LYNN, Mass., December 0.?The explosion
of a boiler today in the four-story factory
building of the P. J. Harney Shoe Manufacturing
Company on Alley street, and the
fire which immediately followed destroyed
iourteen Dunaings in me vvesi L,ynn manufacturing
^.strict,^causing a total /oss estimated
at about 1520,000. Eleven persons
were Injured, one. Miss Celia Tradenburg,
an operative in one of the burned factories,
being in a critical condition at a hospital.
In addition to the direct loss the shoe manufacturers
will suffer severely from the interruption
to their Christmas business.
Of the iniured six are at the hospital.
None will die, it is believed.
The boilers of the P. J. Harney Shoe
Manufacturing Company of this city blew
up this morning and at least twelve people
are reported injured.
Shattered Big Factory.
The explosion, besides shattering the big
four-story factory of th'e Harney Company,
wrecked several buildings nearby In the
crowded manufactui ing district. A heavy /
southeast gale was blowing, driving the
flames with Incredible rapidity until within
a brief space the flames were far beyond
the control of the local fire department, and
help was called from Boston. In an hour's
time two acres in the West Lynn district
had been burned over, ruining the premises
nf mnr*? thnn h?lf a dozpn larcp hii^'n^sa
firms, mostly shoe manufacturers, destroying
twelve dwellings on Charles street.
The exp'osion occurred just before 7
o'clock, as the factory operatives were assembling
for their day's work.
The devastated district la iu West Lynn,
bordering on Charles street and Alley
street.
Doctors and ambulances were hurried to
the scene from all parts of the city, but
with so wide a territory so suddenly
stricken the work of aiding and collecting
the wounded and hunting for possiole dead
was necessarily hampered.
The firte* firms to be burned out or
wrecked by the explosion were:
f. J. warney snoe company.
Tufts and Friedman Shoe Company.
H. P. Hood creamery.
Boston and Maine West Lynn railroad
station.
Jacobs Leather Stock Company.
M. J. Worthley Shoe Company.
Twelve dwellings.
Flames Spread Bapidly.
The force of the explosion burst the four
machinery-loaded floors of the Harvey factory
and lifted the roof. The wreckage
spread outward, shattering the walls of
nearby structures and aiding the spread or
the flames, despite the heavy storm of snow
and sl^et that started early in the day. In
a brief space of time the West Lynn station
of the Boston and Maine railroad was
on fire. Unchecked by the wide gap occupied
by the railroad tracks, the flames
reached structures on the other side, licking
up first the leather stock factory of
the Jacobs Company and then sweeping
through the district covered by small
wooden tenements.
At 9 o'clock the police reported that apparently
no persons had been killed. They
had taken to the hospital up to that time
nine injured. Three of those were but
slightly hurt, and a hasty examination
seemed to indicate that the other six were
not fatally hurt. By 9 o'clock the police
thought the fire was under control in the
district in the vicinity of Alley and West
streets. The financial loss will be about
$450,000.
JAPANESE PRESS COMMENT.
Native Papers Express Oreat Confidence
in Roosevelt.
TOKIO, December 6.?Most of the papers
here highly eulogize President Roosevelt's
attitude toward the Japanese as expressed
In his message. The Asa hi Is delighted that
the'confidence reposed In the President has
been realized. It says:
"By his firm attitude, prompted by a lofty
sense of justice. President Roosevelt has
added new luster to his already great fame.
It is to be hoped that true Americans will
unite in support of his righteous policy."
The Hochl praises President Roosevelt's
attitude as just and impartial, and Is rejoiced
to find it In perfect accord with the
views or the Japanese government.
"Public opinion here," It says, "believes
that he must have been actukted by an ex- <
alted sense of patriotism to save his country
from dishonor by - clearTy defining the
relative power and authority of the federal
and state governments."
The JIJi Is grateful that President Roosevelt
has expressed exactly what the Japanese
would say.
"They feel at ease," it declared, "since the 1
Japanese cause has been placed in such a
powerful nana." (
The press is almost unanimous in confidently
expressing hopes for a satisfactory
solution of the San Francisco compliea- '
tions.
LOCAL BILLS CONSIDERED.
Two Measures favorably Acted Upon
by House Committee.
The House District committee held its
first meeting of the session this morning.
But Uttle business of importance was
transacted. The Senate bill to incorporate
the national child labor commission re- ]
ceived a favorable report. The objects of i
%
the commission are to promote the welfare
of society with respect to the employment
of children; to Investigate and report
concerning: child labor, to raise the standard
of parental responsibility, to insist on
the protection of children from premature
employment, to co-ordinate, unify and supplement
the work of state or local child
labor committees and to encourage the formation
of such committees where they do
not already exist.
Favorable report was also returned on the
bill introduced by Representative Uwrcnre
last June authorising the Washington Market
Company, In connection with the re[
frigeration of produce stored or sold at the
I Center market, to manufacture ice at any
i suitable place in the District.

c
Special Dispatch to The Star. I
NEW YORK, December 6.?From all in- t
dications the trial of Harry K. Thaw for t
the killing of Stanford White will not t
come up until March. This further de!ay
In the case is caused, it Is said, by the c
move made by Thaw's counsel for the ap- r
plication for the appointment of a com- fc
mission to take testimony outside the state ^
and his subsequent withdrawal of liis mo- t
tion. g
District Attorney Jerome had anticipated s
that the application for the commission d
would be made, and he had no doubt that *
the court would grant it. Accordingly the s
Thaw case was taken off the calendar, as n
it was believed in the district attorney's d
office that the taking of testimony outside
the state would be prolonged indefinitely. f
When, however, Clifford W. Hartridge of is
Thaw's counsel withdrew his application F
for the commission it was said in the J'
district attorney's office that the plans
that had been made could not be changed
to suit the defense.
Mr. H^rtridge's application left the door
open to Mr. Jerome to make a similar one c
on behalf of the prosecution, and It is 8
thoneht that this move on the ttart of the w
district attorney came as a surririae to u
Thaw's counsel, with the result that the v
application first filed was withdrawn. Mr. j)
Jerome was willing that Mr. Hartridjre
should have his commission, but he wanted s
as well a commission appointed to take
the testimony of the mother and brother a
of Mrs. Harry K. Thaw, who are now 1n ^
Pittsburg. s
Another witness whose tes.lmony Mr. ?
Jerofne wanted to have before the court 0
was a young woman who was the close e
companion of the Thaws while they were Q
in i-aris oeiort* xneir iparria*e. ana wno n
is now said to be studying the charac- jj
terlstics of monkeys in South Africa. J'
According- to general belief, it had bpen
the plan of the defense to set forth thit f,
Stanford White treated Evelyn Nes-blt
cruelly before she met Thaw and married ,
him. and that the knowledge of this treat
menc rariKieu in inuw s nimu 10 sucn an
extent that it finally worked him into a
mental condition which prompted him to fl
kill White. The district attorney hoped
to show by the testimony of Mrs. Holman.
Mrs. Thaw's mother, and her brother
that White was very kind to Evelyn Nesbit.
that he treated her mother with every '*
courtesy and provided for an education ~
for Evelyn Nesbit's brother. The plan
pf the defense to examine Mrs. Holman
and her son was, according to report, not t<
pleasing to Thaw's counsel. a

Proposition to Increase the
Executive Powers.
DISMISSAL WITHOUT TRIAL
Recommendation in the President's
Special Message.
EARNEST DISCUSSION EXPECTED
Representatives on the Naval and
Military Affairs Committees Disinclined
to Be Quoted.
Senators and representatives are very
nucn interested in President Roosevelt'*
;uggestion. made In a special message sent
o Congress late yesterday afternoon, that
he executive be given power to summarily
nsmiss naval omcers without formality of
raurt-martial. Proposal of such a radical
leparture from Anglo-Saxon law and cusom
has rather startled the legislators, and
oday they were figuratively catching their
?reath before proceeding to talk about it,
?ut earnest discussion is expected.
The law is that in time of peace an offler
of the army or navy cannot be distiissed
the service until he has been tried
iy a court of his peers and the sentence apiroved
by the War or Navy Department and
he President. Even in time of war an officer
ummarily dismissed has the right of subM
nr??-?.-41 n pnnrt.martinl ?*%*
I cation. The President's plan is to vest In
he executive tile power to take summary
ction, of his own initiative, and rid the
ervice of an officer whom the executive
say think guilty of any offense meriting
ismissal.
The President was moved to this recommendation
because a navy court-martial
ailed to inllict upon a naval officer a punshment
which the department and the
resident thought he merited. The PresJent
thought the offender should have
een dismissed the service, but the court
.as not able to bring In that verdict.
The Recommendation Opposed.
Members of the naval and military affairs
ommittees uf the House, to whom a bill
uch as recommended by the President
rouid be referred, were disinclined today
a give public expression to men opinions
pon this radical recommendation, in priate
conversation, however, tney deprecated v
.. Tneir talk, could not fail to give the
mpression that they will not consent to
ucn legislation.
There is considerable friction In the House
nd SKinale over naval and military nunIons
at beat, due to the resentment aguinat
ome Of the President's recent appointments,
wherein he jumped junior ottu-ers
ver the htyula of many seniors, and geurally
demoralized, it is claimed, the sjstem
f promotion by seniority. the army and
avy have a great many friends in bolb
ouses of Congress and cognizance will
e taken of these cases wnen the Senate
rocteds to the confirmation of the apoinlments.
The best judgment of interested leglsia}rs
is that the latest recommendation for
xteii.-iun of executive autlionly will make
o headway this aesslon and that the adillustration
will probably discover it to bo
ie part of wisdom not to push it.
The President's Message.
The foil text of the special message fol>ws:
To the Senate and House of Representatives
:
"I feol it mv dutv to call vour attention
o the facts that, under the provisions of
r tides 3ti and 37 of the articles for th?
overnment of the navy, the Prisident haa
o longer the authority to d smiss an office*
f the navy In time of peace, unless in
ursuance of a sentence of a general
ourt-martlal, and even In time of war
is right of dismissal is practically subject
j icvicw uy a twui i-umi uai, iu ut* ilmiled
wlth'.n six months, if the accused
fticer demands this court. The articles
n question are in the terms following:
"Article IW. No officer shall be dismissed
rom the naval service except by the ord r
f the President or by Bentenoe of a genral
court-martial; and In time of peace
o officer shall be dismissed exoent in nur
uance of the sentence of a general courtlartial
or in mitigation thereof.
"Art. 37. When any officer dismissed
y order of the I'resident since March 3,
465, makes, in writing, an application for
ial, setting forth, under oath, that he haa
een wrongfully dismissed, the President
nail, as soon as the necessities of the serr:e
may permit, convene a court-martial
) try such officer on the charges on which
e shall have been dismissed. And if such
^urt-martial shall not he convened within
Ix months from the presentation of such
pplication for trial, or If such court, belg
convened, shall not award dismissal or
eath as the punishment of such officer,

iall be void."
"This condition of the law was called to
ly attention by a recent painful and humil Ung
incident., On May 9, litOo. an officer of
ie nary was accused of behavior no indent
and disgusting as to show clearly hi?
nfitness (if guilty, as charged) to ho!d a
jmmlssion or associate with officers and
entlemen. The nature of the alleged mis
induct and the lack of compulsory power
i naval courts to enforce the attendance
r civilian witnesses, as well as the locality
here the offense was said to have been
jmmltted, caused a long and very unformate.
autho quite unavo:dable, de'ay In
is trial by court martial, which did not
scur until January 18. 1906. He was then
jnvlcted, but the court, while imposing- a
;vere penalty, to my surprise as well as
lat of the Navy Department, did not sen nee
the offender to dismissal from the
srvice. The failure of the court to rlfi the
ivy of one so clearly unfit to form a part
r it was commented upon In appropriate
>rms by the department, but It was then
id has been since a source of profound reret
to me that the law, as above set forth,
ade It impractical for me to afford a remly
for this fal'ure.
"Moreover, It Is to be remembered that.
uring to the inability of naval courts, aa
love explained, to compel the attendance
r civilian witnesses, and the further fact
lat they have no authority to receive aa
rtdence the depositions of absent _ wit3Bses,
while the exigencies of the service

;r lest offenses of the nature charged

jnished. In thta case It was found very
fflcult to overcome the natural reluctance
' some of the witnesses to attend and tesfy.
"I am convinced that the President should
ive the authority, upon hia own Initiative
id responsibility, to dismiss any officer
hom he thinks unworthy to remain in the
rvice. I think there is no dinger that
its power would be abused, and If such
inger exists at all It Is so slight as to
> altogether outweighed by the considering
of public policy whieh require this
ithority to be vested in the constitut'onal
mmander in chief of the navy. I therere
strongly recommend that article S8.
i hereinbefore given, be amended by omitng
all of It after the words "general courtartial'
where these words first occur
lerein, and that article 37 be repealed.
