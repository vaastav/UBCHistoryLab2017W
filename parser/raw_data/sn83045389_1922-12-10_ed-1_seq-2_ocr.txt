Commissioners Honor Rich
mond Man at Annual Meet
ing in Washington.
[By Associated Pros*.]
WASHINGTON, Deo. ? KlToits In
havw the Natlon.1l Association of
State Agriculture Commissioners en
on reyord against tin- reappointment
of \V. I". U. Ililrdlni; as governor of
tln> Kederal Unserve Hoard, faileil to
? l.iy at the cla.iliii; session of the fifth
annual meeting of the organization.
A minority resolution of protest on
th<> subject was presenteil from the
Com mil tee on resolutions, lull it was
withdrawn after a brief but sharp <!??
hate. The principal argument ail
vaneeil against adoption was that the
! commissioners should keep clear of
personalities. The subject of Mr.
Harding's reappnintment was llrst
? broils*lit before the commissioners by
Senator llt-tlin, of Alabama, who has
waged a long fight against the for
t?cr governor.
The association did ko on record In
; favor of the "appointment of a real.
I actual" farmer to the reserve board.
In approving the resolution it struck
: out the generally used term, "dirt"
farmer, on the ground that it was un
dignified.
The Immigration restriction law
was approved In another resolution,
but an amendment was urged pro
viding that only Immigrants tin
! tiouticing an intention to become
j American citizens he admitted.
le'ci'-laiion for widened farm cred
its somewhat along the line ?f that
recommended by President Harding
, in his annual message yesterday to
? 'otmrt-ss was urged in still another
'.resolution, which set forth that if
necessary the farmers' credit should
run f"r two or'three years.
' George \V. Koiner, of Richmond.
Agriculture Commissioner of Ylr
clttla. was elected president of the
association, and N. .T. liolberg, nf St.

RATE PROBE GETS
VIRGINIA EVIDENCE
(Continued Krotu First Page.)
tionshtps ns sta"'d His exhibits
listed hundreds of thousands of com
parative ratings in the various classi
fications. The result, would lie a base
rate of per l"i pounds first
class between t'hicago and lialeigh,
acaiust JJ.IR proposed hy the car
riers, although eleven other possible
bases were outlined and discussed by
Mr. Hell, he strongly recommended
this one as avoiding certain Import
ant objections that may be urged
against the uthcrK. As to the rates
liftwftn Buffalo-Pittsburgh Icrrltijry
and the gouth, Mr. Bel! 'fit the exist
ing level of $1 "Ti first-class I* not out
<>f line with Ills tuiidumcntiil arttu
merit.
Xot Seriously <onnldcrril.
Coming next to the rates from the
! Ohio River gateways. Mr. Hell ftsscrt
e?l that the basis proposed in this
ease by tin- North Carolina Corpora
tion Commission cannot he seriously
; considered. for while that State
j wishes to take advantage ?.?f tlio level
of trunk line rates to Virginia cities.
; yet it advocates rates that would Vie
| literally lower in thousands of cases
I to North Carolina than to the nearer
I Virginia cities through whieh the
| Carolina shipments pass. Slimming tip
j this part of his testimony. Mr. Hell
j agreed that the rates proposed by the
I railroads of >1.75 per I <10 pounds first -
I class from the Ohio I'iver crossings
i lo lite <: rccnghoro-Winston-Salem -
j Salishur.v group are not unreasonable
j and are -ipproximnlcly in proper form
Finally, dealing with rate* from
j Kastcrn trunk line and Now Ktr-tland
territories to tho South. Mr. Bell
ptescnlcd exhibits and arguments to
show that the rates from Baliinore
to nil points in Carolina li rtitory and
to (icorgla and Florida should be at
least L'.s cents per lt'? pounds more
than the rates from Virginia cities to
j tlie same points, as against a iti-cent
j iliffiirentia-J proposed by the carrier*.
The Baltimore ratfc is the decisive
j factor, since upon it are built all
! rates from Philadelphia. New York.
' Providence and Itoston and all against
I total points, mi , many cents above
; Baltimore. in this connection. Mr.
i Bell asserted thai while distance is a
1 necessary factor in rate making.
! there are other considerations enu il
[ ly if not more out rolling in the de
| ti rminatIon of a reasonable and non
i discriminatory rate structure
Arguing from the same h> pothe?is.
j lie said in conclusion that in no < ase
{ should the rates between Virginia
cities and Atlanta territory In* great
er than from the Ohio River to the
I same points.
