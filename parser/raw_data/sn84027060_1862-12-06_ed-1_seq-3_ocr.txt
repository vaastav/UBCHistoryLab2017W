An Appeal! on behalf or Soldiers* Fam
ine*.
The following appeal of Governor Morton to
the people oi Indians, on behalf of the families
of soldiers in the army, is equally applicable to
Iowa. We earnestly and urgently call upen the
people of our State to respond, as in duty bound,
and as they are abundantly able to do
Indiana has at this time nearly one hundred
thousand of her eons in the field, enduring the
hirdships and privations i&cident to the life of
soldiers. They have gone forth at the call of
their country to defend, with their lives, the
Constitution and Government under which we
live. Thoupan-Js of these- brave and patriotic
men have left behind them families, with tem
porary provision only for their support. In
many csBee these families, during the approach
ing winter, will twin need of the ordinary com
forts and necessaries of life and destitute oi the
means of procuring thetat Many of them are
too spirited to ask for assistance others, unless
some svstem is adopted for their relief, will not
know where to apply. The soldier's pay is often
long delayed, hie own necessities require a por
tion of it, and the remainder is frequently de
layed in being transmitted to his family. It
requires no argument to prove that, even if he
tends a!l his money home, one hundred and fifty
six dollars a year is a very scanty support for a
family, especially at this season of high prices.
In many places business of all kinds is so much
prostrated that those who can and are willing to
labor, are unable to find employment. Every
thing bears a high price, and everything is CASH.
The truth of what has been stated must, be ap
parent to every one,and it remains with the pat
riotic and liberal citizens of the Stato to apply
the proper remedy. It is their solemn duty to
see that the needy are cared for that, while the
soldier is braving the perils of the battlefield, his
wife and children and all who are dependent on
him are nude comfortable at hom* and espe
ciilly that his chfdren are provided with books
and afforded an opportunity to attend school.—
This is not charity, but a sacred obligation,which
should be met promptly and willingly, and the
ncipiants fbould be made to feel that they are
not objects of charity, and that what they receive
it but the partial discharge of a debt of the most
binding character.
It mav be urged by mioy that they have al
ready c'vea lategly and sacrificed heavily for
these benevolent objects, and hence that they
ought to be excused from further drafts. It may
be asked, in reply, what are these sacrifices cons
pired with the sacrifices of families who have
fiven their nuural supporters and protectors to
the c»n*e of their country What is the sacri
fice of the man living comfortably at home, even
thcush he give hilf his income, to that of the
nvi who has left his faiiily and home and gone
to the field
The hed ie full of wealth, the harvest has been
boaotiful, ?.n'1 there can he n» reasonable excuse
for allowing the nedv to suffer in a country like
this.
I would, therefore, respectfully and earnestly
finest, that in every township, in every^town,
and in everv ward of the several cities in the
8t*te, some systematic plan, bv means of regu
1«W organized committees or auxiliary aid so
cietieg, be at once adopted for relief.
To Ministers of the gospel I would say: No
cobler work than this can engage the time jon
Bty have at your disposal. Much can be done
ty appeals from the pulpit and by personal ef
forts with the people by visiting the families of
soldiers, ascertaining their want*, and seeing that
ttoy are regularly supplied.
The Township Trustees
in the several counties,
on account of their familiarity with local affairs,
*iU be able to render great assistanoe in the
bunane work, by giving a portion of their time
»nd efforts to the relief of the needy and desti
tute.
ID all measures of relief which nay be adopted
I most respectfully and confidently bespeak the
hearty aid and co-operation of the noble women
of Indiana. Actuated by the purest patriotism,
*nd always foremost in deeds of love and mercy,
wey may here find an extensive field for the ex
"cise of many kindly offices to the advantage
ud eomfort of the distressed tbeir words of
^beouragement will cheer the hearts of the'droop

others to undertake tbeaame good work.

HALLECK ON McCLKLLAN.
The following synopsis of Gen. Halleck's re*
port to the Secretary of War, was telegraphed
to the Chicago Tribune:
WASHINGTON, Deo. 2, 1862,
Gen. Halleck, tbe Commander-in-Chief, in his
report to the Secretary of War, states that he
started on the 24th of July to visit tbe Army of
tbe Potomac, to ascertain if there was a possi
bility of an advance on Richmond from Harri
son's Landing, and if not to form some plan of
uniting the armies of Gen. Pope and Gen. Mc
Cleilan, who was of tbe opinion tbat it would
require 50,000 additional men to go on. Hal
leck replied that there could not be sent more
than 20,900. General McCllellan asked to
consider the matter till morning, when be agreed
to go on with that number. On Gen. Halleck's
arrival home, he received a dispatch that at
least 85,000 troops would be required. Tbe re.
port states that such reinforcements could not
be sent without leaving Washington and Balti
more almost defenceless, and an order for the
withdrawal of tbe army of tbe Potomac was is
sued on August 3d, a previous order having been
given for tbe removal of the sick, and transports
in vast numbers supplied. A protest was read
from Gen. McCleilan on tbe 5th, and the order
was not put in force for eleven days—uutil the
14tb.
On tbe 1st orders were issued to Gen. Burnside
to embark at Newberg for a Acquis Creek, who
arrived promptly on the Bight of tbe 3d.
It ie added, had the army of the Potomac ar
rived a few days earlier, tbe rebel army could
have been easily defeated, and perhaps destroy
ed. Tbe losses at South Mountain and Antie
tain are put at 1,742 killed, 8,066 wounded, and
913 missing—a total of 10,721. The report
states that tbe army reBted on tbe north bank of
tbe Potomac, near Sharpsburg, from the 17th of
September to the 27th of October, and says tbat
tbe long inactivity of so large an urtny in tbe
face of a defeated foe, and during the season for
rapid marches and a vigorous campaign, was a
matter of great disappointment.
A review of the movements before Washington
is made. He says tbat a part of the Army of the
Potomac was ordered forward from Alexandria,
and that Gen. Cox was ordeied to come by rail
via Washington from Western Virginia with the
main portion of his force.
Gen. Pope's order of the 27th to Gen. Porter,
to be at Bristow Station next morning, the re
port stfs, for. some unexplained reason, Porter
did not comply with this order, and bin corps
was not in tbe battle of the 27th and 29tb, in
which Gen. Pope gained some ground, although
tho battles were not decisive.
Of the reinforcements from Alexandria, em
bracing at length tbe whole Peninsula army, it is
Baid some of the corps moved with becoming ac
tivity, but the delays were neither creditable
nor excusable. Hie soldiers actually engaged in
these battles fought with great bravey, but many
thousands straggled away from their commands,
and it is said not a few voluntarily surrendered
to the enemy, so as to be paroled as prisoner of
war.
In this emergency Cox's troops were ordered
in great baste from Western Virginia.
Halleck then reeites tbe history of Pope's cam
paign brings out a letter from Pope, in which
tbat officer pronounces Sigel as wholly unreli
able.
Halleck commends Pope's earlier dispositions
for isolating Jackson's lorcee/as well planned.—
The delays of some of McClellan's troops in
marching to Pope's relief were neither creditable
nor exeusable. He says no full official report of
the campaign has yet been received from Pope,
He concludes this subject by saying that if Mc
Clellan's troops bad arrived a little earlier the
rebel army could have been easily defeated and
perhaps destroyed.
Halleck next sketches the history of the Ma
ryland oompaign, and denounces the surrender
of Hsrper's Ferry, and impliedly censures Mc
Cleilan for it He then cosaplaios of McGlel
lan's long inactivity in the face of a defeated
enemy, and says be was utterly ignorant of what
his plan of campaign wai, as towards tbe close
McCleilan sent no reports to bim, bat only to
the President direct
Halleck next sketches Buell's campaign, and
•tys that as a commission is ordered tolnvesti
gate, it would be obviously improper for him to
express his opinions now.
Ht says an investigatios has been ordered of
Gen. Morgan's strange abandonment of Cumber
land Gap.
Grant's and Rosecrans' operations are sketched
without comment
Curtis' withdrawal to Missouri is tsrmed un
fortunate, and is said to have prevented the car
rying out of intended movenents in Arkansss.
He says it is quite possible the Indian boetili
ties may be resumed in the
tions
ipricg,
will be
and prepare*
made according^.
The forces in South and North Carolina are
pronounced too small to accomplish orach. Gen.
Halleck calls attention to the fact that our vio
tories have not been followed up, and says tbst
in Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, and Middle
Tennessee the rebel armies have exhibited much
more mobility and action tban our own. He
says this is partly owing to our enormous bag,
gsge and immense transportation, and says tbat
our troops, especially in the East, have been lit
tie accustomed to such marching as is required
by active operationa.
Absenteeism snd straggling desertion are spo
ken of as crying evils, and military laws on this
and other subjects ars said to need revision.

We are beginning to experience some of the
triali of Winter campaigning' All last night
the rain again fell steadily, ana this morning wa
ter is standing in great pools in almost every
camp. The soldiers are grouped around tbeir
camp fires drying their wet garments, and bear
ing upon their faces the unmistakable Indica
tions of having spent a sleepless and unpleasant
night Rain is more disagreeable to a soldier
tban enow. It makea the most patient and un
complaining fretful and discontented with him
self and all his surroundings. And at this mo
ment rain is peculiarly unfortunate, and has a
depressing influence upon the entire army. The
roads from Aquia Creek and Belle Plain are
almost impassable Within a quarter of a mile
Of Gen. Burnslde's headquarters, I saw tbree
heavy transport wsgons stuck fast in tbe mud,
ted all the males tbey could bitob to tbern
seemed powerless to drag them forth. What a
fearful loss to the country has been McClellan's
refusal to march whf$ ordered to do so by Gen.
Halleck. Then we were having tbe moat de
lightful weather, and tbe roads were all ia a
superb condition.
From Harper^ Ferry to Richmond we wonld
have hardly encountered a mud pool. And then,
too, we would have bad our enemy nearly two
hundred miles from his base—now he Is within
sixty, with railroad transportation. Gen. Burn
side may be embarrassed at this point, and it is
barely poasible tbat the campaign may prove a
failure—if so, it it ia but simple justice tbat tbe
onus of the failure be lifted from tbe shoulders
of Gen. Burnside and heaped upon those of
McCleilan.
When we are to move it seems imposible to
telL The great pontoon train comprised of 48
boats, each 30 feet long and drawn by eight
mules, arrived several days since and is ready
to be laid at a moment's notice, or rather those
io charge of it are ready make the attempt to
lay it, in the face of the batteries erected against
it, will be quite another matter. Tbe laying of
the train, if it is deemed advisable to cross the
river here, will be under tbe direction of Gen.
Woodbury, who commands the Engineer Bri
gade, composed of 3,600 practical engineers.—
If not exfmsed to the fire of the enemy it can
bo put down in one bour and forty minutea.
General Lee is working incessantly night and
day in erectiog fortifications all along the highta
back of Fredericksburg. The Bowling Green
road, the telegraph road, and the old turnpike to
Gordonsville, are now commanded by earth
works at every angle. On the Gordonsville road,
where there seems to be a very large encamp
ment, I counted this morning 14 idtrenchmente,
nearly all of which have been thrown up since
Monday. Five came in sight of the Bignal glass
this morning which were not there last night,
proving conclusively that during all tbe cold,
piercing rain, which made even those sitting
beside a warm fire in a comfortable house shiver
they were at work straining every nerve to
strengthen their position. Every day's dela)
now on our part is gain to them. The railroad
from Richmond is running as far as Massapo
oax Valley, but seven miles from the rivei, and
all tbeir supplies and re-enforcements are un
doubtedly received from that source. It is but
simple truth to say, in tbe sight of what is tran
spiring in front of us, that if we but display half
the energv and Eelf-sacrifice of the enemy, we
could drive him into the Gulf of Mexico in three
months.
It is currently reported this evening, that we
are soon to have the aid of another arm of the
public seivice, and tbat tbe recent rains will
hasten its approach to the city. If so, we can
endure with patience the horrible roads our
long trains now flounder through, to the death
or ruin of eo many fine horees. But why could
we not have had this aid before, and what !B the
reason that every time we more something is
wanting to crown the campaign with success?
Captives among the Indiana.
We learn from Major Gilpin, a member of
tbe firm of Labarge, Harkness & Co., who
bave recently established extensive stores on
the Upper Missouri to supply the wants of the
miners thronging to Salmon river or neighbor
ing mines, that in bis recent trip down the
Missouri river in a Mackinaw boat, in com
pany with some dozen others, about one hun
dred and fifty miles above Fort Pierre, they
encountereil a large band of Sauntee Indians
camped upon both sides of the river, who fired
upon him and compelled him to land. The
Indians boasted of being from the Minnesota
river and as having killed very many whites
there, and that they intended to make thort
work of this little handful, and take what they
had. Mr. G. has been a resident of the Indi
an country for many years, and speaks the
various Indian langunges with fluency, and
also, married one of the Yanktonias, who for
tunately for the party, was with them at the
time, and by his ability to converse with them,
and the judicious distribution of nearly all his
provisions among them, togethei with the en
treaties of bis wife to spare them, or her
threats that her tribe would avenge her hus
buand's death—after much delay and intense
suspense tbey were allowed to proceed. Tbey
report some 1200 lodges in tbat vicinity, and
found one yonng lady, about eighteen years
of age, a daughter of James Price, of III.,
and ascertained from her that there was an
otherwoman and five children held as captiies
and could be purchased or would be exebang
ed for ponies. The entire party were grieved
at their weakness and inability to release the
prisoners from their horrible bondage, but
knew that it would be worse than folly to at»
tempt it, they could only comfort them by as
suring them that they would use every exer
tion to urge forward an expedition of sufficient
strength to release them from captivity and
capture the Indians.
This probably settles the question as to the
whereabouts of those Indians who have escap
ed from Col. 8ibley.
An expedition, consisting of one company
of infanary belonging to the 41st Iowa, under
Gapt Mahanna, and Co. A, Dakota Cavalry
are nnder marching orders for Fort Pierre,—
Whether this movement is intended as against
the Indians, or for other purposes, we cannot
tell, but should judge it was a meagre force
to start with, if it was Indians they were after.

Tm BAR-ROOM BRIGADE.—A gentleman who
has just returned
from
Washington, telto us
that the number of officers in that

around drunk, semi-drunk, tipsy, and a uttle

of the army with which Gen. Taylor whipped
twenty thousand men at Buena Vista. There
seems to be nobody who has authority to re

they have BO far lost the pride which should
animate the soldier, as to be willing to shirk,

a

The same ups and downs are so very exciting.
But a sombre sight is a battle-field,
To the sad survivor's sorrowing eye,
When those who scorn to fly er yield,
In one promiieoua carnage lie
When the cannon's roar
Is heard no more,
And the thick dun smoke has rolled away
And the victor oomee for tho last survav
Of tbe well-fought field of yesterday
No triumphs flnsh that haughty brow
No proud exalting look ie there,
His eagle glaaee is humbled now,
As earthward, in ltfe anxious oare,
It seeks the form whose stalwart pride
But yesterday morn was by bis side!
And there it lies on yonder hand
Of corses, which themselves had breath
But yester morn—now cold and dark,
With other dews than those of death
Powerless as it had ne'er been bora,
The band that clasped his yester morn!
And there are widows wandering there.
That roam the blood besprinkled plain,
And listen in their dumb despair
For sounds they ne'er may hearagaint
One word, however, faint or low,
Ay, e'en a groan—were music now!

Cnrtova Incident In the War—An Inftort
atMl Vtnaale Captarea 10 Mcnaoatoia
Captain Boight of Company H, 23d Kentucky
Regiment, formerly a resident of this city, snd
who hss just returned on a short furlongh, re«
lates to us the following curious anecdote of tbe
war, for tbe veracity of which he will himself
answer:
During the retreat of the army of Kirby Smith
from Cumberland Gap, tbe regiment to which
he belonged was in tbe van of tbe Federal army.
One morning, when tbe regiment was about 26
miles east of the Wild Cat Mountains, they were
surprised to see a file of ten men, all of them
aecesb, marching toward tbeir lines, and a wo
man marching in their rear with a musket in
her hands on their coming within the Federal
lines she coolly gave them up to the officer com
manding as prisoners In accounting for their
oapture, she-said that her husband had joined a
military company io the Federal service, and
bad left her alone to take care of the bouse,
which lsy between the two artnies. Eleven Se
cessionists had come into the house tbat mora*
ing and proceeded to make themselves perfectly
at home, first killing all her chickens, and set
ting them to roast by the fire. Tbey then pro
ceeded to dispose of the things around the bouse
taking up the carpets, and constructing hors6
blankets out of them.
Tbey next perpetrated other atrocities of a
destructive and objectionable character, which
bad tbe effect of making the lady of the house
"furiously wild," as tbe Captain expresses it,and
she determined that such outrageous conduct
should not go unpunished. She accordingly
carried away their muskets to a place of safety,
reserving two for her own u«e, and then going
to the room in which they were regaling them
selves on her defunct chickens, she informed
them that they were her prisoners. One of them
jumped up to seize tier, when clie leveled her
gun at bim and fired, causing him to bite the
dipt, which lay thickly stiewed on the carpetless
floor. Throwing away the now useless gun, she
took the other in her hand and ordered the re
maining ten to march toward tbe Unon camp
threatening to shoot the first who attempted to
run awny. Having a wholesome fear of sharing
a simitar fate to that of their companion, they
went quietly along, and were accordingly handed
over to the military authorities. On being
laughed at for being taken prisoner by a woman,
tbey said they had been wanting to get captured
for some time past, and were heartfly glad that
they were prisoners at last They were entire*
iy siek of the war, they SAid, and did not care
how so that they got out of it—[Cin. Gaz.
Tbe immortal Iowa Second Infantry has had
the following Colonels:—Samuel Curtis,
James M. Tuttle, James Baker, Noah W. Mills,
and James B. Weaver. Of these Colonels, Cur

Mills were killed at Corinth. The same Regi
ment has had for Lieut Colonel*, J. M. TutUe,
M. M. Crocker, James Baker, N. W. Mills, J.

Adjutants are as follows: N. P. Chipman, T. J,
McKenney, Joel Tuttle, and George L. Godfrey.
Chipman aud McKenney have been promoted,
and Ajutant Tuttle is dead. Des Moines has
furnished three of the above officers, viz: Crock
er, Mills and Godfrey. From its age, aod from
th? confidence reposed in it, the Iowa 2d has
had an opportunity to distinguish it»elf, and it
has made for itself a glorious history.—[Du

and amuses himself in dancing around the room
at Mr. Newby's, the eminent naturalist, and at

His skin ia of an olive color, and. ts he is yet
very young, only slightly covered with hair.—
He is remarkably found of good living, and ap

and mutton chops, and fruit Yourg Mr. Go
rilla is about three feet and a half in bight, very
broad ana thick across the chest, while his arms
and legs are long and ainewv, displaying great
strength. He has a great habit of putting his
feet into any stray boots and shoes which may
be lying about, and when he is discovered in his
freaks, be iovariablv runs for protection to any
lady who may be preseat. His face, unlike the
generally entertained opinion, is not fierce or re
pulsive looking, although the jawa are both

TH* ADVAHCI IN Paics or PITROUUA^
—Refined petroleum has gone up recently from
'ixty-eight cents per gallon to one dollar aad ten
cents. Some ot tbe journals attribute this rise
to the lessened product of oil at tbe wells, aod
say tbe supply ie failing. This, however, is not
the true reason. The cause is scarcity, but
activity arising from suspension of the burliness
refining. In Jane tbe most of the refiners stop
ped work, under the fear that the Government
tax would ruin tbe business. After three months
of suspension, work waa resumed by some of
the refiners, but bad roads to the oil wellf made
the getting out of crude oil a slow process.—
Meanwhile the stock in market baa been greatly
reduced by consumption and foreign shipments.
Many of the moat extensive refiners bave orders
on 'hand for all they can make in a month, and
the proepeet is that high prices will rule for a
few weeks to come. The foreign demand is very
large, as in Europe the oil to Med directly for
manufacturing gas. Some of the richest and
most expensive colors uss* fw dyeiuB are ob
tained from tbe petroleum.—Phu. Ledger.
