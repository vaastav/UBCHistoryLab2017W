Letter from Columbus Boy in a
Georgia Prison to his Parents.
The following letter from a member of
Company A, 05th 0. V. I, was received by
his pareuU on Tuesday evening. It Is the
first letter they have hud from him since he
was taken prisoner near Gun town, Miss.,
on the 10th of June last. It camo by way
of Annapolis, Md. :
CAMP LAWTON PRISON, GA.,
FRIDAY, Nov. 18, 1864.
Deaii Parents : Having an opportunity
to send you a few lines by a sick friend, who
Is expecting soon to bo exchanged, I em
brace it with Minority. I am still in the
very best of health, and have scarcely seen
a sick day since my imprisonment. A re
port reaches us through the papers that an
exchange of fifteen thousand sick and
wounded has been agreed upon. I hope, if
that is the case, the Commissioners will soon
agree to take the balance the well out of
durance vile. I am growing tired of this
monotonous life, and long for my freedom.
One thing is certain, that if we had some oi
those "great guns" In witli us a few days,
they would most speedily effect au ex
change.
Since my capture I have ,seen what you
might call rousrh times, especially at Sum
ter, where we had barely room enough to
move In. At present we are getting along
very well. He have plenty of room and
sufficient food. The rebels arc giving us a
few sweet potatoes, which aredolng theslck
with scurvy an immense amount of good.
The only thing we lack is clothing ours
is in a most dilapidated condition. If kept
in prison many mouths longer without fresh
supplies of wearing apparel, I anticipate
that I shall be minus the aforesaid covering.
I hope, however, to be with you long be
fore that time arrives.
I would like dearly to give you a detailed
account of my captivity; but circumstances
will not permit. I must wait patiently un
til lean give you a verbal history ol my
sojourn In Dixie. There are now messed
with me three of Company A George II.
Young, Evan Evans and John Walton, all
in good health And as fat as the common
run. The other boys of the Company are
scattered over the camp all well. Wchave
had one dealh Jacob Hammer, on the 18th
of October. Two others S.I). Winegarner
and Alex. McPherson are among the sick,
and will no doubt soon bo on their way
home. It is our sincere wish and prayer
that we may soon follow.
You cannot imagine how welcomo a
word from home would be. Six months
without a line from you have appeared an
ugc. Could I but correspond with you oc
casionally, my prison life would not be half
so irksome, and a great di al more pleas
antly spent. In fact, I would not mind it
scarcely at all. Dear pa
rents, keep up a cheerful heart. I am con
fident, tilings cannot always be as they are
at present. Give my best wishes to all my
friends, and remember your absent and af
fectionate son In your prayers.

SHERMAN'S ARMY.
A Battle in Front of Savannah on the
10th—Loss Heavy on Both Sides—
10th—Loss Heavy on Both Sides— Communication With Foster.
New York. Dec. 14. The World's Wash
ington special hag an account of a battle In
front of Savannah on Saturday, the 10th.
which he gays comes direct from a loyal
resident of Richmond. He says twenty
thousand of Sherman's men at an early
hour crossed the O?eclieo river below
Bloomingdale, some twelve miles south of
Savannah, and masiing-betwcen that point
and Tel I a ir, the left wing extended so as to
cut the Charleston and Savannah railroad.
Communication had been ellected the pre
ceding day with Foster, who was again rap-
luiy advancing on urutiamsviue, tnc reoeis
retreating from thelrstrong position south of
l'oeotaligo bridge, evidently alarmed at
finding themselves threatened both in front
ana rear by superior forces. Sherman, who
was in the Held, fou.id himself confronted
by a large force of regulars and militia en
trenched. The battle began early in the
day, and was contested with great fury on
both sides, the garrison of Savannah, num
bering twelvo thousand veterans, par
ticipating. ' Towards noon a grand
charge was made by he Union troops,
which carried sonic of tho works on the
enemy's left and center, threatening to cut
hliu oil' from the inlet and city. This was
followed by an advance of the whole line,
which doubled up the rebel formation In
confusion, and they lell back to the imme
diate vicinity ot the works lu the rear of
Savannah. Our troops pursued to Tel
fair on tho south, and a corresponding dis
tance along the upper railroad. Here our
troops rested, finding the enemy's works
very strong and our men, from a heavy
inarch the previous night and the severe
lighting, being worn out.
The loss was severe on both sides 2,500
Union and between 3,000 and 4,000 rebels,
among whom were fully 1,200 prisoners, In
cluding many olilccrs ol rank. Colors, can
non, small arms, wagons and caissons were
captured. Smith, Ilardee and Cobb were
in command of the rebels, whose loss at
lirst was less than ours, owing to their pro
tection, but at the close of the. action they
su lie red tremendously. It Is believed all
the rebels at the head of tho inlet, 4,000 or
5,000, would be captured.
The facts, says the World's correspondent,
have been carefully concealed by the rebel
authorities. The greatest consternation
prevailed at Charleston.
The last word left Sherman close to the
coast, either able to form a junction with
Foster and the licet, or to attack Savannah
with prospects of success.
Washington, Dec. 11. Richmond papers
of Monday received report Sherinairmove
ing on In close proximity to Savannah,
lieaurcgard commands the defenses of the
city, assisted by Hardee, Smith, and proba
bly Taylor. Kebcl papers say a battle may
be progressing to-day, and express them
selves confident of success. Bragg was at
Augusta at last accounts.
l'assengcrs by the mall boat to-day re
port they heard heavy firing yesterday
morning in the direction of Dutch Gap.
FROM NASHVILLE.
Rousseau's Success at Murfreesboro
—The Situation Unchanged.
Louisville, Dec. 14. The Journal's spe
cial from Nashville 13th, says: The weath
er Mas considerably moderated. AU our
forts have done more or less firing to-day,
but apparently with little damage to the
enemy. Skirmishing between the lines was
renewed witli greater earnestness than for
some days past. The enemy yesterday fell
back to nis main line, but to-uay lias rein
stated his force on his outer lines.
Dispatches fully confirm the success of
itousseau s troops under JVlllroy. Ucneral
Bates' division is within two miles of Jlur
freesboro. Nothing has been heard from the rebel
brigade that crossed yesterday at Cumber
land City.
A dispatch received to-day from Rous'
scan says Murfrecsboro is all right, and lie
expressed confidence to hold the place
against any lorce the enemy has at Ms com
mand. -
Nashville, Dec. 13. Situation unchang
ed. No advance lias been made by the Fed
eral troops, as yet. Grapevine information
was that an advance was to have been made
to-day, but no movement was made by our
forces. Some skirmishing transpired on
Harding pike and several guns were dis
lodged from Fort Negley. No results arc
reported. The slippery state of the ground
renders locomotion impossible, and hostili
ties will be postponed until a change of
weatner occurs.
Nashville, Dec. 14. Yesterday after
noon a recon noissance was made by the
regiments from Stead man's corps, near the
Jlurfreesboro pike. Sharp sklrmishlngoc
curred during the afternoon. No losses on
tho Federal side, except some half dozen
wounded.
Deserters who came In yesterday report
that Hood had altered his lines somewhat.
Later and more reliable information, how
ever, asserts that the rebel forces are still
In their former position. Hood has been
reported sick at Franklin witli typhoid fe
ver, but the report is not credited. He is
undoubtedly with his troops within a few
miles of Nashville.
A lot of government wood was destroyed
by a party of Confederates ten miles down
tho river yesterday.
A portion of rebel Gen. Lyon's command
are reported to have burned some trestlo
work on the Edgefield & Kentucky It. It.,

Weather moderating. Heavy rain last
night. River eight feet and rising considerably.
Gen. Warren's Expedition—Grant
Hopeful.
New York, Dec. 14. The Tribune's
Washington special says: Congressman
Washburne, who returned to-day from
Grant's headquarters, represents Warren's
movement as a perfect success, and that
Grant is confident of the wliolo situation.
Mr. Washburne himself feels more confi
dence in the future from this visit than from
any previous one.
Warren's mission was to destroy tho Wel
don road and bridges as far as possible, and
to discover and destroy the new cross road
from tho Wcldon to the Danville, which
Grant knew was in process of construction
and was designed to serve to Richmond
her supplies from the South. This was
ruined by Warren.
The Tribune's Army of tho Potomac
special thus sums up the results of War
ren's expedition : Making a rapid march of
fifty miles, he destroyed three important
bridges, over twenty miles of railroad, a
large amount of forage and other store3,
burned Sussex Court nouse, captured a
score or two of prisoners, and will reach
camp to-morrow, having sustained but
trifling loss.
Gen. Kilpatrick Reported Killed.
New Yokk, Dec. 14. The Commercial's
Washington special says : Richmond papers
of the 12th contain no news from Sherman,
but there aie rumors that Union prisoners
report Gen. Kil pa trick killed; also that a
Union cavalry force had left Baton Rouge
destined for Mobile.
Gen. Hays and Col. Wild have been pa
roled by the rebels to distribute supplies to
Union prisoners. - - ,

Dealt With.
HEADQUARTERS DEP'T OF THE EAST,
NEW YORK CITY, Dec. 14.
General Orders No. 97.]
Information having been received at these
headquarters that the rebel marauders who
were guilty of murder and robbery at St.
Albans have been discharged from arrest,
and that other enterprises are actually in
preparation in Canada, the commanding
general deems it due to the people of the
frontier towns to adopt the most prompt
and efllcient measures for the security of
their lives and property. AU military com
maudcrs In the frontiers are therefore In
structed, In case further acts of depreda
tion and murderare attempted, whether by
marauders or persons acting under com
mission from the rebel authorities at Rich
mond, to shoot down the perpetrators, if
possible, while In the commission of their
crimes; or if it be necessary, with a view to
their capture, to cross the boundary be
tween the United States and Canada. Said
commanders are hereby directed to pursue
them wherever they may take refuge, and
it cantured. they are, under no circum
stances, to be surrendered, but are to be
sent to these headquarters lor trial and
punishment by martial law.
The Major General commanding the de
partment will not hesitate to exercise to the
luiiest extent tne aucnoriiy ne possesses
under the rules of law recognized by all
civilized States in regard to persons or
ganizing hostile expeditions within neutral
territory and fleeing to it for an asylum
after committing acts of depredation with
in our own; such an exercise of power nav-,
lng become lnuispcnsaoie to protect our
cities from Incendiarism, and our people
from robbery and murder. It Is earnestly
hoped that the inhabitants of our frontier
districts will abstain from all acts of retali
ation on account of the outrages committed
by rebel marauders, and that the- proper
measures of redress will be left to the action
of the public authorities.

Rebels Driven Out of Newcastle—
Lyon Advancing on Russelville.
Louisville, Dec. 14. Captain Bridge
water, with one hundred and twenty-live
men, went Into Newcastle to-day and drove
out Jessie, with a loss to the latter of thir
teen killed and wounded. Bridgewatcr
chased them through Port Royal and was
only eight miles behind at that time. It is
thought the rebels wjmld be captured by
Bridgewater's forces.
Col. Johnson telegraphed that tho rebel
Gen. Lyon's advance is moving on Russel
ville. His main force, 25,000 strong, is at
Elkton.
Tho Democrat says: We are informed
that Gen. Lyon's rebel forces burned the de
pot and several sheds atlladcnsville, on the
Memphis Branch railroad, yesterday. A lot
of bacon stored in the depot, and a
large lot of tobacco under the sheds await
ing shipment to the city, was destroyed.
The rebels are conscripting every body they
can li nil.
From Mobile Bay.
New York, Dec. 14. A Fort Morgan
letter of tire 30th tilt., to the New Orleans
Era, says : The nearest reported rebel
force to this point is safd to be at Fish river,
fifteen miles up the Mobile bny. Then this
is nothing more than an advanced post.
They remain very quietly on the defensive,
with the exception of an occasional shot"
from the rebel batteries at our gunboats,
simply to getrange. Ineithcrca.se nothing
of importance lias occurred. A new rebel
rani has come down the Toinbigbee rIVer
and is now at Sell mi, having her armor and
plating put on. She is reported to be a
very formidable engine of war, of the pat
tern and 6tyle of the rani Tennessee, cap
tured by us during the Fort Morgan bom
bardment. She is expected to Arrive in
Mobile at an early date. There are said to
be seven rams and gunboats Inside the ob
structions, besides some water batteries. Tho
obstructions are of a very strong and al
most impassable nature, with large! piles
driven into the eartli some eight feet be
neath the water. It will require skill and
daring to overcome these rebel means of
defense.
It Is said that there arc no less than four
or five blockade runners at Mobile, all
eagerly waiting to escape.
CONGRESSIONAL.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.
SENATE.
The Senate assembled at noon, Mr. Clarke
President pro tern., In the chair.
Mr. Nesmtth presented the memorial of
the Legislature of Oregon praying for tho
establishment ot a manufactory ot arms in
that State.
Mr. Grimes, from the committeo on Na
val Aflalrs, reported a joint resolution ten
dering tlio thanks of Congress to Captain
John A. Winslow, of the U. S. Navy, in
accordance with the recommendation of
the President. He moved the Senate pro
ceed to the consideration of the resolution,
and asked unanimous consent to do so.
Consent was given, and the resolution con
sidered and passed.
Mr. Grimes reported from the Naval com
mittee a similar resolution in the case of
Win. B. Cushing, which was passed.
Mr. Wilson presented the petition of sev
eral line oflicers in the army, asking for ad
ditional compensation. -Referred to Mili
tary committee.
Mr. Wilson, from the Military committee,
reported back the joint resolution ollered by
him yesterday, with the recommendation
that it pass. It was read the lirst time.
Mr. Trumbull, lrom the Judiciary co'm
mittee, reported a number of private peti
tions. Mr. Trumbull also reported a bill author
izing tho holding of a special session of the
U. S. District Court in Indiana. The bill
was passed.
Mr. Chandler I see In the morning pa-
5crs the following announcement from
'oronto: "The St. Albans raiders have
been discharged for want of jurisdiction."
I desire tooirer a couple of resolutions bear
ing upon this subject, one of them particu
larly. -But I do not expect to make tho
Senate understand the state of feeling exist
ing on the border. I have a great number
of letters from gentlemen living on the bor
der. In my own city, which Is within mus
ket range of the Canadian shore, thousands
of citizens have been under arms for a long
time. We have been iu a continual state of
alarm from incendiaries, burglars and rob
bers. From this announcement it would
seem that the Canadian authorities have
made up their minds to protect these rob
bers. As I understand It, a man comes from
the South with a commission purporting to
be issued by JeS. Davis. lie enlists his
robbing parties, crosses the borders, mur
ders, robs whom he pleases and returns to
Canada, where he is protected. These let
ters, which I have in my possession, are all
bei.ring upon this point. The one in my
hand now is from one of the most respecta
ble citizens of Detroit a gentleman of
great wealth and of high political and so
cial position, who earnestly desires to avoid
any diflloulty with Great Britain at this
time. He says:
"The anxiety growing om of the mist and
doubt encircling every rumor that reaches
us, is not to be endured, and if, upon some
slight provocation, our people shall be
found engaged in Canada In some act that
the Canadian Government will say is
wrong, Booner or later war will be the re
sult." V
He says also: "Will you give this sub
ject your Immediate attention, for I think
it involves sooner or later. It not properly
managed, war with Great Britain."
Mr. President, l nave no expectation of
making the Senate comprehend the state of
affairs thus announced, and the state ot
feeling on that border. Verraont"may, for
ought I know, quietly submit to-have her
towns robbed and her citizens murdered,
but the Northwest will not. I offer this
resolution: " 1
Whereas, Recent raids have been organ
ized In the Canadas and Nova Scotia, and
men enlisted in said British provinces by
men purporting to hold commissions from
the rebels, for murdering and robbing
peaceable citizens of the United States, for
burning cities and villages, for piratically
capturing merchant vessels ana murdering
their crews, and for a system of murder,
arson and jobbery, and plunder of peacea
ble and unarmed citizens of the United
States; and, whereas, the people of the Brit
ish provinces seem disposed to protect these
thieves, robbers, Incendiaries, pirates and
murderers, not only in their individual ca
pacities, but by the quibbles of the law;
therefore,
Jietolved, That the committee on Military
AlTairs be directed to inquire into the ex
pediency of enlisting an army corps to
watch and defend our territory bordering
rn the lakes and the Canadian line, from all
hostile demonstrations and incursions.
Mr. Johnson I object to the resolution.
The President pro tern The resolution
will lie over, objection being made.
Mr. Chandler I had hoped there would
bo no objection to it. 1 will now offer
another resolution, which I ask to be re
ferred to the committee on Commerce. The
resolution was received, and is as follows:
Whereas, At the commencement of the
present rebellion the United States were at
peace with all the Governments in the
world, and on terms of comity and good
will with Great Britain; and, whereas, that
nation, before the arrival on her soil of our
Mini.ner accredited to the Administration of
President Lincoln, precipitately acknowl
edged the rebels as belligerents, thus re
cognlz'ng their flag upon the ocean, with
out which recognition it would have been
regarded and treated as piratical by anoth
er powers; and, whereas, she then pro
claimed perfect neutrality Mtween a repub
lic with which she had entertained friendly
relations forupwardsof half a century, and
Its treasonable subject"; and, whereas,
numbers ot her subjects, with the full
knowledge of her authorities, commenced
fitting out last sailing vessels loaded with
munitions of war for the purpose of run
ning Into our blockaded ports for the rebels,
thus furnishing them the means of or
ganizing and continuing the rebellion, and
without which it could not have sustained
!tself for six months; and, whereas, in ad
dition to the above, and with the knowledge
of the Government, British subjects and
members of Parliament engaged In toe
manufacture of piratical English ships,
owned by British sub)ects, manned by
British seamen and sailing under British
colors, forthe purpose of burning, destroy
ing ami utterly driving lrom the ocean all
peaceful vessels sailing under the United
States flag; and, whereas, many private
unarmed American ships have been burned
and destroyed by these pirates from Eng
lish ports, thus causing great loss and
damage to the citizens of the United States;
therefore " .
llesolved, That the Secretary of Stato be
instructed tojnake out a' list of each cargo
thus destroyed, witli fair and separate val

destruction to the date of presentation, and

Mr. Johnson objected to tho resolution,
which lies over.
Mr. Doolittle wished to have the resolu
tion in relation to taxation, offered by him
Monday, taken from the table and referred
to the committee on Finance.
Mr. Doolittlo said : I desire to call the
attention of the members of the committee
on Finance to the special points mentioned,
without at all entering into a discussion.
The resolution instructs the committee to
inquire into the propriety of a tax on all
sales of both real and personal property ac
cording to the best estimate that can
be made. The smallest amount that would
be produced by this tax would be seventy
five million dollars a year. It not only
proposes a tax upon sales actually made
but uprm all who sell stocks, gold and pro
duce. It will have more of a restraining
effect on speculation in gold than any gold
bill which can be passed, which shall make
it a penal offense to sell gold iu the market
or make any distinction between gold and
paper currency. It also proposes that the
committee shall mature into the propriety
of adding a tax ot 25 per cent, to all the
railrond fares of the country, including
street railroads, steamboats and ferries.
making such companies tax-gatherers for
the benefit ot the Uovernment. 'lucre is a
source of income and revenues which
is the most immediately accessible of
any which the Government can lay
hold of, which would be received in
large quantities from powerful companies,
whose revenues would become immense.
This is the time when we should seize hold
of these means which will produce revenue.
for tho money wo must have. Another
point in the resolution is simply to inquire
whether it is not best to prevent the organ
ization of any new banking companies, al
lowing at the same time those banks now
lu existence to withdraw their circulation
and to go into operation under the general
banking law.
Mr. Doolittle then explained the fourth
provision of his resolution in reference to
the substitution of other interest-bearing
notes ior tnose now in circulation.
Mr. Sherman Before a vote Is taken
would like to say a word or two. 1 have
no objections to the reference of the resolu
tlon, but will state that the committee of
Finance have already this subject under
consideration, as recommended by the Sec
retary of the Treasury in his annual report,
and by the President of the United States
in his annual message. All the points at
Issuo will be considered in tho committee,
without any resolution on the subject.
Mr. Sherman explained further, that
while it was well enough for Senators to
express anxiety on the subject, all bills to
raise revenue must originate in the House
of Representatives. The Senate should re
member that at the last session it passed
a resolution for a special income tax, and
the House sent it back on the ground that
all sucli measures .should originate in tho
House. He thought that this resolution
would create a controversy with the House,
which he desired to avoid. The Senate
must await their action.
Mr. Brown I have no objection to the
reference of this resolution to the committee
on Finance, if it was introduced simply for
settinsr forth the views entertained bv thn
Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Doolittle), of
indicating the direction in which lie thought
inquiry should be made; but if it is going to
that committee by general consent, and is to
be taken as any indication that the Senate
nnniira tn tlin anrfirnstlrvna mrifln T etrtull fnsi
one say that I differ very widely in regard
to the policies he has indicated and the ef
fects to follow from that which he seems to
anticipate. I will add but one more word,
and say this : That I think the gentlemen
are perhaps mistaken in regard to the ex
tent to wtticn taxation can be carried, and
that we are perhaps nearer to the point at
which it can be properly borne than manv
persons Imagine.
Mr. Sherman believed there was necessi
ty for Increased taxation. There were sev
eral reasons for it. The soldiers were now
serving in the field and enduring the hard
ships of military service, while citizens
wero reaningrich profits from the war bv
engaging in business, and were doing bet
ter than they had done during any previous
year. He thought it was but right they
who are reaping the profit of the war should
pay.liberally iu taxes. If we increased our
national debt and put those taxes upon fu
ture generations, we compelled these sol
diers who had fought our battles to bear
the expenses of the war. This would be
unjust. -
Sir. Brown continued his remarks, advo-
eating a reduction of expenditures in the
conduct of the Government.
Mr. Doolittle I agree with the Senator
from Missouri entirely-in what he savs
about the necessity of reducing expenses
in every possible way. I will go with him
in any effort to reduce them and to compel
tho Administration in every department of
the Government to exercise the strictest
economy possible. At the same time, our
necessary expenses are so great, and must
be so great, that we are compelled to seize
hold of every source that will certainly 1
bring us revenue. I do not expect, of course,
that these resolutions shall go forth as ex
pressing the views of the Senate upon the
points I have presented. Still the points
are of sufficient interest and importance to
be well considered by the committee.
The resolution was then referred without
objection.
Mr. Chandler moved that the resolutions
offered by him to-day be printed; which
was carried.
Mr. Brown offered the following, which
was adopted :
Jlesolved, That the committee on Military
Affaire and the Militia be instructed to in
quire into the expediency ot repealing an
act of Congress of March 21st, 1861, enti
tled "an act to remove the United States
arsenal from the city of St. Louis, and to
provide for the sale of the land on which
the same is located."
Mr. Doolittle moved that all bills, peti
tions and memorials which werepending at
the close of the last session of Congress be
referred to their appropriate committees.;
This wes carried r
A joint resolution from the House was
announced, giving notice to Great Britain
of the termination of the reciprocity treaty.
air. poster moved to refer it to tne com
mittee on Commerce.
Mr. Sumner thought It ought to go to the
committee on Foreign Relations, and it was,
on motion, so referred.
The Senate went into executive session,
and soon after adjourned.
HOUSE.
I
Mr. Wilson of Iowa, from the committeo
on Judiciary, reported a bill amendatory ot
the act of July 17th, 1802. to defln'e the pay
and emoluments of officers of the army, &c.
so as to read that "anv alien of 21 years and
upwards who shall nave enlisted in the
volunteer or regular army, navy or marine
corps, and been honorably discharged, may
become a citizen without any previous dec
laration, and shall not be required to prove
more than one years residence." The bill
was passed.
The bills for a ship canal around the Falls
of Niagara and a ship cannal from tho
Mississippi to Lake Michigan, were turthur
postponed until the 22d day ot January
next.
On motion of Mr. Brooks of N. Y it was
riCtnlveiU That the committee on Foreign
Affairs Inquire into the expediency of pro
viding by treaty or otherwise for the pro
tection ot our Canadian and Provincial
frontier lrom murder, arson and burglary
on the pretense of rebel invasion.
Mr. Schenck, from the committee on Mil
itary Affairs, reported a bill pending, that
all Major Generals and all Brigadier Gen
erals in the military service of the United
States who, on tho 15th day of February,
1805, shall not be In the performance of
duty or service corresponding to their re
spective grades and ranks, and who shall
not have been engaged In such duty or ser
vice for three months continually prior to
that date,- shall then bo dropped from tho
rolls of the army, and all the pay and emol
uments or allowances of such general ofli
cers shall cease from that date, and the va
cancies thus occasioned may be tilled by
new promotions and appointments as in
other cases; but no officer is to be consid
ered as included in the foregoing pro
vision whose absence from duty shall
have been occasioned by wounds received
or disease contracted in the Hue of his duty
while in tho military service, or by his be
ing a prisoner of war lu the hands of the
enemy, or under parole; and any Major
General of volunteers who may have been
appointed from tho regular ariiiy under the
authority given in section 22d of the net of
1801. to authorize the employment of volun
teers to aid in enforcing the laws and pro
tecting public property, and the acts amen
datory thereto, who shall be so dropped
from the rolls shall not thereby be dis
charged from the service of the United
States, but shall be remitted to his position
and duty asau officer of the regular army.
Second. Thereafter continuously until
the termination of the existing war of the
rebellion, on the last day of each month af
ter the 15th day of February, 1805, the pro
visions of the foregoing section shall bo
made applicable to any general officer In
ttie military service of the United States
who shall not, on'said last day of any mouth,
have been engaged in the performance of
-duty or serviee corresponding to his proper
rank lor three months consecutively then
next preceding.
Mr. Cox inquired of his colleague what
had become of a similar bill introduced
here at the last session.
Mr. Schenck replied, that having passed
the House it hangs in the Senate.
Mr. Cox saw no necessity for the passage
of such a law, as the President now has the
power to drop officers for incompetency or
inefficiency. He asked why the Senate had
not acted on the old bill ?
Mr. Schenck replied that he could not
tell Ills colleague the reason for the Senate's
non-action on the subject, as the question
had been fully discussed at the last session.
He (Schenck) would now merely move the
previous question.
This was seconded, and under its opera
tion tho bill was passed by a vote of 93
against 38.
Tho House proceeded to the consideration
of the joint resolution pending from July
last, authorizing the Secretary of the Treas
ury to appoint thrco commissioners to in
quire and report at the earliest practicable
moment the best and most efllcient mode of
raising by taxation the necessary amount
of revenue for supplying the wants of the
Government, having regard to the sources
from which derived,with power to take
testimony under such regulations as may
be prescribed by the Secretary of the
Treasury.
The above resolution was tabled by a
vote of 08 yeas to CO nays.
The House took up and passed without
debate the Senate bill authorizing the pur
chase and construction ot sixteen revenue
cutters on the lakes, and appropriating one
million dollars for that purpose.
The House went into committee on the
President's Message.
Mr. Brooks of New York made a speech
in opposition to two points in tho message,
viz : That the war must go on wlthoutany
further negotiation, and that the war
must continue until slavery is abol
ished throughout the United States.
He maintained that the subjugation of tho
South was Impossible, and warned e-cnrlp-
men against Intolerance on the subject of
slavery. Mr. isrooKs said our ditucultics
can be adjusted by negotiation, but never
by arms.
Mr. Price, of Iowa, replied by saying
that the speech delivered by Mr. Brooks
was intended to strengthen the hands of the
slave-owners, and to that extent depress the
Union cause.
The House, nfter further remarks lrom
Mr. Brooks, adjourned.
