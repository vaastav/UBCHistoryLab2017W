' ' No documents which hT jet appear
ed throw so powerful a light open the
rtlativa condition of the Federal Govern
ment and the rebellions States, as the
late oClcial declarations of President
Lincoln and Jefferson Difi. A par
ti L! of the tieesages conc'nsirelj estab
lishes the progreei cf the Union and the
decaj of the Rebellion, as set forth by
the Chief Magistrates cf the contending
parties. ' Grave reveries befell our arm
soon after your departure from Rich
EiOad," aays Da is to his fellow-traitois
in Onjrce1; "I would hare called an
extra tesiioc, but for serious obstacles.'
lie then proceeds to announce the fall
of the strongholds, Vicksburg and Port
lludsor; the important position of Jack
son, the fall of Little Rock, and evacua
t on of Arkantar; thesurrecder of Com
. brrland Gap, and the loss cf commuoica-
tion between Richmond and Middle Ten
nessee, and the crushing defeat of Brsgg
by Grant, and the rout of Longstreet by
Rurnside. So Jefferson Davis sums up
Lis list cf calarcitits, with embittered
and gloomy language.
How dilfcrent the statements of Presi
dent Lincoln : "The Rebel borders are
pressed still further back, the country
dominated by the Rebellion is divided
into two distinct parts, with no practical
connecticn between them, and Tennessee
and Arkansas have been cleared cf Reb
el armies." Such is ft summary of the
domestic viewcf tie case, in which Jef
ferson Davis mourns over defeat and dis
aster, and President Lincoln tells of vic
tory and steady advance. Nor is the
contrast between the two messages re
specting fortigi cations leBS striking.
Mr. Davis save: "The altitude of the
Eorpean governments has been in some
cases positively unfriendly; the Rebel Com
missioners to England meet with rebuffs;
the United States are encouraged to coc
tinue the blockade cf the Southern port;
Karl Riisficll says that relations with the
Rebel Stales xcouldle d'screJHul!c,lecausc
Otry are s'aixlioMing;" and the British
Government concedes that the Rebel
Slats are "mere dqwdenciei' of the Uni
ted States. So caks the arch cocspi
rator. Hear next the President: "We
remain in peace and friendship with for
cign powers. The British Government
has used its authority to prevent the de
parture of Rebel titles from its port; and
France, by a like proceeding, has indica
ted her ncntraliiy." Oar foreign relations
piroa. -vwtu m ujvb wuuiirauie uuudl-
tion, while those cf the Rebellion are
perplexed, end forbidding in all respects
Mr. Davis says that the finances cf
the Confederacy demand a prompt reme
dy to carry on his government, and adds
the icmaikablo statement, that the taxes
provided for the redemption cf Confeder
ate money have actually increased Hit
deli in place of diminisluug it. lie draws
darker picture cf rebel finances than
I Lave seen in any other qatrtcr. S
writes Davis. Mr. Lincoln says : "The
opt rations cf the Treasury have
been successfully conducted. The
enactment of a national banking law has
proved ft valuabh aid to pullio credit
and the loan law. has fully met the
hopes of its friends. And money, be it
remembered, is " the sinew of war.
Bibert Toombs, of Georgia, declared in
late speech that the side which held
the longest purse would win in this war.
The tone of the President's Message is
cheerful and manly, whila that of Davis
is neither, li s rage and despair actually
make him stoop to the degradation of
expressing satisfaction at the proposed
establishment cf ft French Monarchy in
Mexico, right on the border of Lis pet
Confederacy. A remarkable thing tbat
the man who used to bawl the loudest
for the Monroe doctrine should cringe
abjectly at the feat of Louis Napoleon.
Davis says the war 11 ''indefinite in its
duration, and that there is no pros
pect of pcac?," whila the IYeeident,
full of Lope and patriotic confidence
looks forward to the triumph of
the Nationil arms. While Davis
breathes forth wrath, undying hat, and
slaughter, the President proposes ft plan
for fraternal restoration. Such is a hasty
and imperfect parallel of the two Mes
sares," whose leason will bs indeliby
impressed upon the mind of all Christen

Ma. Editor S: The pleasant duty
devolves upon me to chronicle one of those
pleasant events which are the oases cf ft
physician's life. The event to which I
allude was the prescn lation of ft beauti
ful sword-cane, lai t evening, to Dr. B.

lientii of this hospital, as a token of their
reppect and esteem for Lira as a gentle
man and phyaician.. Dr. Walker has
been on duty here since this hospital
was organ! xad, and has won thj esteem
and love of all by his gentlemanly bear-
ing aad kind treatment of patients placed
tinder his charjre. The presentation was
' made b- Mr. Henry C. McCoy, with
'ew appropriate icmarks. Dr. Walker
responded ia his usual happy vein.
These are pleasant episodes in ft sur

What should the rebel population of
Tennessee do ? The President has offer
ed them pardon, on certain conditions.
Ought they lo accept his offer ? This is
question which, in our opinion, does
not admit cf debate. But one answer
can be given to it ; and that is an affirm
ative. We are glad to see that the Press
counsels them te accept the offer, and re
turn to their allegiance. If they do cot
recpond favorably to this advice, they
will stand in their own light The re
bellion is bound to jro under. This bas
been manifest for two years past. The
work of suppression has bees slow, but
sure. Rebels may deceive themsdres
with foolish Lcpes, but in the end they
must " knock under." If they do so now,
they can avail themselves of the Presi
dent' amnesty. If they wait why they
mail submit to such terms as the victor
forces upon the subjugated.
What bas the Dispatch to cay cn the
subject ? What would it advise its rebel
readers, with whom it is favorite, to
do ? It can now do them an important
.nice. Their ears are open to tho ad
monitions f our wary contemporary,
Will it give them the advantage of its
views upon this all important matter?
They are sleeping upon ft volcano, and
need a trusty sentinel to arouse them be
fore they are overwhelmed in a stream of
molten lava. Learned definitions of the
term amnesty, are very good in their
places. But at present they are like Dead
Sea fruit ashes and bitterness. Sound,
wholesome counsel is what the ill-fated
rebels need counsel which will illami
nite their oath through the nicht cf
.darkness and trouble which has closed
around them. Speak to them, Dispatch.

A friend has . laid before us an eld
newspaper, ". The Camden and Lancas
ter Herald." dated June 7, 1S31. . It was
prihted at Camden, South Carolina. At
that date tho nulliflcrs and secessionists
of South Carolina were moving-heaven
and 'earth , to induce the State to
clnnrre into the sea of rebellion. .The
Ilerald contains a speech of cne of the
conspirators and traitors of that day,
George McDuflie. Glancing over it, we
find an argument against the objection
raised acatnst disunion. th it wrnld
lead to civil war and bloodshed, lie
closes the, Argument with the following
assumption : ,
" TLj idea of bloodshed and civil war,
in a contest or tais kind, is utterly
ridiculous.' "How would the war com
mence ? Who would begin it, and what
would be te occasion or pretext of using
arms? I confess I am utterly at a loss
to lmsgiDC. ' .
So the disunionists in 1831 sought to
deceive the people into rebellion. There
would be no war, no bloodshed. ' So in
1SG1, their disciples gulled the credulous,
Jeff. Davis stating. in a. public speech
that he could " hold in the hollow of his
hand all the blood that would be spilt"
if the Southern States 6houl J revolt In
both instances, the .leaders were con
scious of the Tin truthful character of
their declarations. Th?y knew that dis
union meant "civil war and bloodshed
I that no nation ever permitted peaceable
eparation, ana tna it would be marines?
for any nation to think of such thing.
They meant to bewilder and mislead with
false Lopes. The first attempt was a
failure ? The second was more success
ful, and they Lave now "civil war and
bloodshed" to their hearts' conlent.

after daylight this morning, and carried

The Freedmen's Village at Greene
Heights, Arlington, Va., recently estab

ter cf the Department of Washington for
the use of the colony of contrabands who
are cultivating the Arlington estate for
themselves, and not for it former owner,
.Gen. Lee, the leader of the rebel army,
was dedicated with appropriate excrcis
e, Dec. 3. In connection with it, the
school-house and chapels erected by
friends for the American Tract Sociefy
and the Home for the Aged and Infirm
Freemen, erected by contributors in
Providence, R. L, and also to be under
the care of the Tract Society, who will
here make many comfortable and happy
who have spent long years cf unrequited
toil, were also dedicated.
The exercises were held in the Socie
ty's chapel, which was crowded with
visitors from Washington and George
town, among whom were Gees. Ueint
zleman, Augur and Abercrombie, Col.
Greene and many other distinguished
men. A choir of thirty colored children
from the Society's School at Camp Bar
ker, sang several patriotic pieces, to the
feat delight of the audience. Mr. N. P.
Kemp, of the American Tract Society,
presided. Mr. N. Nichols, Government
Superintendent of Contraband, spoke of
their condition since they had been un
der his care, and highly commended Col.
Greene for the successful management of
the present undertaking. Rev. W. A. Ban

Yery eloquent addresses were then de

Treasury ; Hon. Mr. Eriggs, of this City ;
Mijar Bea Ferley Poro, of the Boston
Journal, and Hon. D. W. Gooch, member
of Congress frcm Blsssicnuseetts. lneoc
ciaion was onceofdep intern t and anew
interest was awakened in the philanthrci
ij efforts for the elevation of this class,
now occupying so much tho attention of
thoughtful men.
The American Tract Society was the
first to enter the field ia caring for the
escaped slaves, who began to crowd into
Washington early in 1SC2. They estab
lished a school fur them in Duff Green's
Row, when they were located there; and
since they moved lo Camp Darker, ihey
haved carried cn a very successful scho',
in a building erected tor this special pur
nose, by friends in Philadelphia and
Boston. This school will be continued,
and as well as that at Frtedmen'd Vill
age, is conducted by a corps competent
teachers under the charge of Mr. 1L F.
Simmons, late of Providence. The result
have been most satisfactory and the
prospect is very encouraging.
That ablest cf Canadian papers the
Toronto Globe, opens its comments on
the President's message in the fol'owiBg
words: ' Tho great Southern rebellion is
on its last bgs. It may last six months
or avoir, but it is net to be disputed
by any fair mind.'d observer that it is dy
ing. Tha fall of Richmond and thi liLjht
of Jeff Davis and his Cabinet cannot be
far off." The Glot e thinks Mr. Lincoln
does tot fully set forth in his messzge
what is to be done with the South when
it is conqaereu, out ms present move
ment for the pacification of tho South is
of the "pegging away" order. "It is not
strictly logical, nor it is comprehensive,
but it may achieve a great success. ' Tb
Globe thinks tho Suthern people wi 1
scoi be ready to tal e tha oath after their
armies are subdued, and fiough some
fiorco ei iri's may long holdout, 'they will
bo regarded as the Jacobites ia Britain,
who, even within the preesnt century,
have refused to take the oath of fealty to
the Hanoverian line, ibere will be com-
motions ana rumors 01 cemmouons, a
great army. will be needed to preserve
order, and the expense will bo heavv :
but in thj end Mr. Lincoln's 'peggin away'
will bring, the Southern people to sub
mit to what is inevitable.

in the famous winter of 'li, when the

were compelled to land their passengers
and freight in the second stories cf the
