A Matter of
Knowledge
By
JULIA TRUll'T BISHOP
(Copjrfgkt. 1MI. by Anthers SjndleaSa.)
MT AM comr.
I Martin,
thin? but satis
pelled to tell you, Mrs.
that your niece is. any
satisfactory.
Mrs. Martin finished counting her
1 itches, and then looked up with an
expression that was almost like sur
prise. "Why, Mr. Martin!" she said, in that
gentle little tone of hers; "I am sure
1 thought you thought
UJ thought you thought," roared the
judge. "What do you mean by all that
conglomeration, Mrs. Martin? Did
you really think anything on the sub
ject? No, madam, you cannot prove
that you did. What you took for
thoughts were merely impressions,
and very inaccurate ones at that.
Your impression was that 1 was sat
isfied with Leonora. A week ago that
might have been true, but now it is
not."
Mrs. Martin arched her eyebrows
to express surprise, because she was
counting more stitches and could not
apeak just then.
"Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen," she
said, presently. "What has Leonora
been doing, Mr. Martin?" -
"Oh, it all comes of not having taken
her when we took Ethel," said the
judge, still tramping madly and care
fully about the room. "We raised
Ethel ourselves; or rather, I raised
her, for you are a slave to that fancy
work, which the gods confound! and
now look at Ethel! I tried to get you
to send for both of them, but you
must let your sister take Leonora, and
now she comes to us, and the result
shows that your sister was a woman
totally deficient in judgment, Mrs.
Martin, totrflly!"
"Yes, but nine, ten, e-lev-en what
has Leonora been doing, Mr. Martin?"
. "Doing, ma'am? She has been do
ing nothing. It is the things she has
said. You know very well the plans
I have been making for her a hand
some girl like that a girl that could
marry anybody, ma'am anybody!
and I took pains to throw Jerry Cor
dovan's son into her society, and I
really thought she was pleased with
him and so last week I hinted that
nothing would delight tae more. And
what do you think she said, Mrs. Mar
tin? What do you suppose Miss Leon
ora had the effrontery to sav to me?"
"I am sure I don't know," said Mrs.
Martin, helplessly.
"Why, she straightened herself up
and said: 'Uncle Ad, I haven't the
slightest objection to your contin
uing to choose my dresses for me, or
even my hats and shoes, for I don't
like shopping; but I am going to
choose my husband for myself, if you
please!' Think of it! The ungrate
ful minx said that to me! That comes
of taking girls after other people have
raised them! And ever since then
she's been as cold as ice to Frank Cor
dovan, and has had no ryes for any
. body but that Morris boy a nobody!
a a private secretary to a tenth-rate
congressman!"
"Maybe you don't understand Leon
ora," suggested Mrs. Martin, as a
plausible way out of the difficulty.
The tramp up and down the room
ceased and an -apoplectic countenance
was turned upon the lady with the
fancy work and John, the colored
servant, who had come in to put on
more coal, remarked to the cook a
few minutes afterwards:
"Hi, de ole jedge suttingly do take
on when he lose his temper! Ef he
ic'.ild jes stan' off an hear hisself a
rarin' nn' a pitchin' when he get riled,
he'd sho put himself in de lock-up fo
distu'bin' de peace!"
"Mrs. Martin, how do yon suppose
I have ever been able to obtain my
present position at the bar without
being a judge of human nature as well
mm if tlif. lnw? TV, vnn not. knnw flint
I am considen d the best judge of men
in the state that it has been re
marked in the press that I have the
faculty of reading men at a glance?
and do you insinuate that I am not
able to judge a slip of a girl, not 20
years old? Xonsense! I know all
about it! 1 know that she is a per
verse young woman, bent on her own
destruction. If she marries a nobody
like that secretary, I'll never see her
again never! No, madam, I will not!
Ah, here's my girl! Where you have
been this morning, little kitten?"
Little Kitten, leaning her head on
his shoulder "Down to the book
store. Uncle Ad, to get that magazine
you wanted."
Uncle Ad, radiant "Ah, just see
that! She barely heard me mention
that magazine.; and yesterday it was
to get my umbrella mended. She
never forgets her old Uncle Ad, does
he, pet?"
Pet, twisting the topmost button of
his coat and smiling up at him ra
diantly "You were quarreling when
I came in, you know you were. Didn't
you know that you are not allowed to
quarrel? What was it about, sir?
Tell mc this instant!"
Uncle Ad, beginning to grow red
again "Oh, nothing at all. I am only
amazed at jour sister, Ethel simply
amazed at her! there, don't get ex
cited, pet, it's nothing serious. I was
merely remarking that if your sister
took it into her head to marry a no
body, like that Morris Gray, then I
am done with her forever." -
Pet pretending to shake him by
means of .the button "Oh, you
dr adf nl old ogre! You know you'd
forgive her in a week!"
Ogre, furiously "Forgive her,
Bitss? What do you know about it?
Only let her try it, that's alL I really
think she'd be silly enough to do it;
and now that I have warned her I shall
THE FlST NIGHT.
When her little one laughs to-night,
Oh, what shall I tay?
When he comes for his romp with me.
In the glad old 'way,
While she lies white where the night winds
Wow :Si-r;..-When
he, with a loss that he cannot know,
. Gleefully shouts as the careless may
What shall I ay oh, what shall I seyT
When her iKtte one kneels to-night.
Oh, what shall I say?
Wb hs pray for her who was left
Out there to-dy.
When b ass mo s messing xor asr and
leave her to think ft over And
act
for herself. There, well not talk
of
it any more. Get the macazinc and
read me that article 1 was talking
about."
The reader will suppose that a week
has elapsed since the conversations
just recorded, and that the gout has,
to use an expression of John8j"got
de ole man floored." In this condition
his temper is not angelic. John and
the cook have agreed on that point,
and the family have been equally cer
tain of the fact in question. Leonora
has heard the changes rung on her
exasperating and undutiful and un
grateful conduct, every day, and has
been reminded, many times over, of
the awful fate that awaits her if she
persists in her present most astonish
ing and unwomanly course.
But having made this assertion for
the hundredth time, until Leonora
may be supposed to have grown some
what accustomed to it, the gout gave
him an extra twinge one day, just as
Miss Leonora came in, smiling and
rosy, and heard of this desperate fu
ture without a tremor.
"But why should I care?" roared
the judge, nursing his foot and his
wrath with equal tenderness. "As
you make your bed, so you must lie.
Marry anybody you like, miss! Marry
the dev "
"Oh, Uncle Ad!" cried Miss Leonora,
rushing at him jubilantly. "Do you
really mean that you are not going to
try to make me marry Frank?"
"Make you marry?" shrieked Uncle
Ad, wild with rage. "Don't be a fool,
Leonora!"
'Oh, Uncle Ad, I'm so glad, because,
you know, I like Frank and I think
he likes me in fact, we like each oth
er" "What do you mean? What do you
as I live, you minx, you are in love
with Frank!"
Miss Leonora, with a prim and
fetching air "But, Uncle Ad, you
know I was not going to be made to
marry anybody!"
Uncle Ad, limping wildly around
the room "Ha, ha, ha! The cunning
little rascal! Mrs. Martin, come here!
Think of her fooling her old uncle that
way! Where's Ethel? John, call
Ethel I want her I want her this
minute. How surprised she'll be!
You little hypocrite! That's one time
I was taken in, I'll admit that. John,
you idiot, what are you grinning at?"
John, sober on the instant "I wan't
a-grinnin', seh. Please, sch, heah's a
note dat was jes' lef at de do' by a
white man, seh."
Judge, searching vainly for his spec
tacles, and unable to find them be
cause they are on top of his head
"Confound those glasses! Here, Mrs.
Martin, read this letter!"
Mrs. Martin, reading "Dear Uncle
Ad, Morris and I were married this
morning at St. Paul's. We have been
engaged ever since a month before
Leonora came, and we didn't want to
run away, but what else could we do?
We know that you can never forgive
us, so we won't ask it; and, of course,
we'll be poor, but we don't mind that.
So, good-by, dear old Uncle Ad, and
dear Auntie and Leonora. Your Lit
tle Ethel."
The sensitive reader will please ex
cuse himself for a few moments and
leave the room until the worst of the
storm has blown over. By this means
he will retvrn just in time to see the
judge raging up and down with a limp
and a look of agony, and to hear him
roariug, lion-wise:
"Ethel! Ethel! That child! Why,
I could have told every thought she
ever had, from her cradle up. She was
as transparent as glass, madam! And
here she has been engaged for months,
under my very nose! Where did she
meet him? When did she see him?
Hew did they ever have a chance to
talk about love? And I believe Leo
nora knew ell about it! Ah, look at
Ler face! It makes a man doubt the
evidence of his own senses when he
can be circumvented, hoodwinked, de
ceived, by these girls in pinaforesl
And to deceive me--me!"
Mrs. Martin, innocently "But, Mr.
Martin, I thought it was Leonora that
you didn't want to marry Mr. Gray.
You never said a word about Ethel.
If you didn't war t Ethel to marry him,
why didn't you f-ay so? and then, of
course, I would have tried to prevent
it, for anybody misht have known that
he und Ethel were in love with one an
other." Judge, Maggering back and sinking
into a chair "Ha! Another! Mrs.
Martin, do I understand anybody?
Does any man understand any wom
an in the world? Are you a woman
with a mania for f;ucy work? or are
you a female Sherlock Holmes, with
a pebble in one pocket and a red eye
lash in the other?"
He kicked at the stool before him,
and then remembered his gout, with
a shriek of anguish, and threw a mag
azine at John, who hud forgotten to
leave the room.
"Are you standing there grinning
yet, you Cheshire csit?" he cried. "Why
haven't you gone tfter her, sir? Go
and bring her back at once, do you
hear? at once! Who takes care of
me like Ethel? Write a note, Leonora,
and tell her to coiae. I suppose you
might as well tell 'em both to come,"
he added, grudgingly, "for just as like
ly as not she'd refuse to leave him.
Nobody knows. The man who thinks
he -understands women is a fool."
"Sixteen, seventeen, eigh teen,
murmured the female Sherlock
Holmes.
"Yes, seh, I'll git 'em home, seh,"
said John, whose countenance was all
one broad grin. "I knowed you wan't
a-goin to ho" out no time."
"Another!" groaned the judge.
"Another!" And after several min
utes of silence, the judge, a very deep
ly humbled judge now, remarked
meekly: "Angelina, that is a very
pretty thing you are making. I don't
think I ever noticed it before."

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Oplwloaa ( the Press Resrardlasj
Roosevelt's First State Paper
to Coasren.
The president's message is not
short. This is not a short-message
sountry. Indianapolis News (Ind.).
Ohio congressmen and senators laud
the message of President Hoosevelt.
Ohio always was in touch with the
country. Cinciiyiati Commercial.
What the president didn't say with
regard to trust regulation and tariff
restriction is what the people wanted
most to hear. St. Louis Republic.
Greater messages have been writ
ten by presidents of the United
States; but no message has been bet
ter written. What he has to say, he
says in a clean-cut English; no jug
srling; no maudlin sentimentality.
He drives straight into his subject
and dismisses it as soon as possible.
Indianapolis News (Ind.)
President Roosevelt's first, message
is the most comprehensive that has
come from the white house for many
years, but long as it is the American
people will find it worth their while
to read it through. The style is clear
and animated, the questions treated
in many instances affect the great
ness and the welfare of the country
and the commendations are of the
first importance. N. Y. Sun.
The message is so voluminous and
so crammed with discussion of mat
ters of wide interest that it is im
possible to crowd an adequate review
of it within a moderate space. It is
characterized by the lofty spirit and
high purpose of its author. Much is
left to the unguided wisdom of con
gress, which may imply a Incoming
modesty on the part of the president,
coming suddenly to the duties that
had filled the mind and ripened the
judgment of his predecessor. N. Y.
Mail and Express.
President Roosevelt's messaire is
like the man practical, business-like,
straightforward, earnest and strenu
ous. Though a literary man as well
as statesman there is no attempt at
fine writing in it. The condensed de
partment reports are omitted by the
president. This is a wholesome in
novation. It leaves the nu ssage all
his own. It contains plain state
ments of facts and literally bristles
with recommendations, which show
the suggestive and resourceful char
acter of the man. Congress will have
to hold night sessions to dispo-- of
the business which the president lias
cut out and laid before it for action.
Chicago Tribune.
President Roosevelt's lfse.
The fear expressed that the presi
dent's message would be too long was
idle. It is safe to say that no man
will count the words, but that every
one who takes it up will read it
through with relish. From the first
paragraph, with its tender tribute to
the memory of Mr. Mc Kin ley, to the
last, with its earnest expression of
appreciation of the foreign sympaihy
offered to the nation in its hour of
sorrow, the paper is one of individuali
ty and of interest. It leaves no impor
tant question untouched, and it dis
courses of none in any obscure or
halting fashion. The man of opinions
gives his opinions in clear and concise
style, and so as to impress upon the
reader the belief in the author's ab
solute sincerity. A trained writer and
thinker, holds the pen, and he holds
it very firmly. Congress, at any rate,
cannot complain, because the consti
tutional requirement that the presi
dent shall from time to time make sug
gestions to that body with relation to
the state of public business and the
public welfare was never more com
pletely compiled with. Here are sug
gestions enough to Inst the session.
And all of them are good. Lucky will
the country be if even the half of them
are followed. Washington Star.
A Great Paper.
No president's message, except the
war messages of Lincoln and MeKin
ley, was ever looked for with greater
interest than the message of Presi
dent Roosevelt. Knowing the man and
appreciating the circumstances under
which he took up the duties of his of
fice, public expectation was high, but
the message more than meets it. It is
a great paper from the standpoint of
the masters in statecraft, from the
standpoint of the literary man and the
scholar, from the standpoint of the
people attached to our institutions and
interested in public questions. It
shows the grasp of the statesman, the
training of the scholar and the man
of affairs, 'and reflects the spirit of an
intensely patriotic people. Chicago
Inter Ocean.
If there are any who expected that
President Roosevelt's message would
be a startling one, in whole or in part,
they are well disappointed. The doc
ument which the president of the
United States transmitted to the con
gress shows in every line that the
man who wrote it is the man who
pledged himself, over the dead body
of his slain predecessor, to carry out
the policies of the McKinley adminis
tration. It is a product of careful
thought. Albacy Journal

The bright Hyde Park boy chewed
gum and saw no reason for the trick
monkey abstaining from such enjoy

gum, noticed the monkoy watching him
closely and divided with the animal.

His Salary Not Proportionate.
There was one occasion when Sir
Henry Irving received from one of the
supernumeraries of the Lyceum an an
swer which seemed to satisfy him. It
was the man's duty to say simply:
"The enemy is upon us," which he ut
tered at rehearsal in a poor, whining
way.
"Can't you say it better?" shouted
Irving. "Repeat it as I do." And he
gave the words with dignity, with all
his well-known dramatic force.
"If I could say it like that," replied
the man, "I shouldn't be working for
25 shillings a week."
"Is that all you get?"
"Yes."
"Well, then, say it as you please."

the warden, told the negro that it was
all fixed; that he was not to work in
the coal mines, but be watchman at the
dead house instead. "'Laws A'mighty!"
shouted the affrighted negro. "Tell
