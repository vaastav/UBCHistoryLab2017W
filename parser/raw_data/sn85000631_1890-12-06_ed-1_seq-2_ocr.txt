Bufltelo Bill En-Route to Standing Rock.
[From Bismarck Tribune, 28th.
Among the distinguished people who
alighted from.yesterday morning's Pacific
express was Col. Cody—"Buffalo Bill"—his
old time friend Dr. Frank Powell, better
known as "White Beaver," John Keith,
manager of Cody's ranch at North Platte,
Neb., and Ii. II. llaslan, known as "Pony
Bob," who one time made the remarkable
ride of 108 miles in eight hours and ten
minutes. The party was at once surround
ed by an interested and curious crowd,
many of whom remembered Buffalo Bill
when he was here away back in 1876—the
year of the Custer massacre. Buffalo Bill
bears an important commission from Gen
eral Miles and is 'on his way to Sitting
Bull's camp on Grand river. The details
of the commission cannot be made public
at present, but it may be surmised that
Buffalo Bill will find out all there is to
know of this Messiah humbug craze before
he returns, or know the reason why. Sit
ting Bull knows Buffalo Bill, and if he has
been reading the newspapers lately he will
have learned that almost immediately upon
his arrival from Europe last week, in a
pigeon shoot contest in New York lie
brought down ninety-eight out of one-hun
dred. Dangerous man to fool with is Buf
falo Bill. The party left for Standing Rock
about 2:30 yesterday afternoon, Con Malloy
acting as wagon mister with two teams
and relays provided for at Parkins' ranch.
A special train was chartered to take the
teams over the river, as the party desired
to go via. Fort Lincoln.
Buflhlo Bill Called Back,
[From Bismarck Tribune, 2d.
Buffalo Bill, Dr. Powell and Pony Bob,
returned to Manaan Sunday night and pro
ceeded eastward Tuesday. Conn Malloy
the teamster who drove them down— leav
ing Bismarck Thursday afternoon—return
ed to Bismarck yesterday afternoon, lie
was glad to get back. The atmosphere at
Standing-Rock is not good. The, Indians
out on Grand River where Silting Bull
holds out are crazy over the Messiah and
Conn was told by his friends that he was
just as safe in Bismarck as he would be in
driving Buffalo Bill out to Sitting Bull's
camp. The party arrived at Standing
Rock Saturday, and immediately started
with an inderpreter for Sitting Bull's camp.
Col. Cody (Buffalo Bill) had a special com
mission from General Miles to arrest Sit
ting Bull and tnrn him over to the military
authorities at Fort Yates. He was on this
mission, but. when about twenty
miles out trom Standing Rock
he was met by Louis Primeau,
who told him that Sitting Bull was en
route to the agency via the other road
about five miles distant. The party drove
over to the other road but could see nor
hear nothing of his chieftanship Bull. The
party camped for the night with a half
breed, while the interpreter with Buffalo
Bill was sent back to the agency to learn
if the report was true and if Sitting Bull
hal really gone into the agency. The in
terpreter did not have to go far to learn
that the report was untrue. The party
started on Sunday morning, but had not
gone far when a special courier overtook
them with an order through Col. Drum,
post commandant at Fort Yates, from the
wardepartment at Washington, ordering
Buffalo Bill to return at once without in
terfering with Sitting Bull. The party
turned back and came straight to Mandan.
It is rumored that this sudden
change in the programme as made
by Gen. Miles Was brought about
through the interference of the interior de
partment through the advice of Maj. Mc
Laughlin, agent at Standing Sock. The
future developments will be looked for
ward to with interest. It is evident there
is a conflict between the war and interior
departments on this Indian, question, and
it remains to be seen which department of
the government will come out on top. It
is evident that Gen, Miles believes in cap
turing not only Sitting Bull but all other
leaders and disturbers and-. remove them
from their simple followers, He has also
moved a large number of troops in the
vicinity of the agencies with the intention
of overpowering'the refractory redskins
and disarming them before they have an
opportunity to commit any depredations.
While the wisdom of sending Buffalo Bill
to effect the capture of Sitting Bull may be
questioned, his general plan will be en
dorsed.

A Prlxe Plght Knds in a General Riot
Among the Spectators.
DAYTON, Ohio, Nov. 28.—The prize fight
between Billy Gibbs of Kansas City and
Dick Moore of St. Paul this afternoon end
ed in a riot. The scene of the fight was an
open field three miles from the city. The
battle was witnessed by 150 sports. Hut
two rounds were fought and both were
lively, in the first, Gibbs fouled Moore
twice, but the claims of Moore's second
were ignored by the referee in deference
to the spectators, many of whom had paid
$10 each to witness the fight and wanted
to see some slugging. In the second round,
after a lively exchange of blows, Moore
landed one that sent Gibbs on his knees.
While Gibbs was down, Moore struck him
again and this proved a knock-out blow.
Cries of "foul!" rent the air. The crowd
broke over the ropes and a general melee
ensued, in which the seconds and specta
tors took a hand. Moore swung his right
on one of Gibbs' seconds. Pistols were
drawn, slung shots used and at first blows
were freely exchanged. It would have
been worth the referee's life to have an
nounced his decision, and he wisely in
formed the crowd that he would render it
at 9 o'clock to-night. His decision was
a draw.
Interesting Postofiice Statistics.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28.—The postmaster-
general in his annual report reviews'the
legislation of congress and dwells at some
length upon the changes for the better dur
ing the year in administrative methods.
Eight hundred thousand dollars have been
saved on contracts, and yet the mail routes
have been extended over 2,000,000 miles.
Inspectors have handled a larger number
of cases than heretofore and have fewer
on hand. The anti-lottery legislation has
caused extra work but it lias also removed
one iorrn of temptation to thieving from
the clerks. Negotiations with Germany
for seaport offices have been successful.
The gross revenue is nearly 35,000,000 lager
than ever before. Almost 5.000 more post
offices have been established than in any
one year heretofore: free delivery lias been
established in fifty-three towns star route
mileage 11,000,000 clerks have reduced t,lie
dead letter mail by two million. He says
swifter mail service is necessary and then
proceeds to argue for postal telegraph. It
is for the same method as he has hereto
fore explained. He says the new
lottery act accords with his former
recommendations and the press and the
people have helped the department by
their general approval. He favors ocean
mail service, for which a bill is now pend
ing in the house. There were 14,408 post
masters appointed during the year and
6,274 removed. The number of new offices
established during the year 1890 was 4,236,
making a total of 62,401. He says the way
may soon be clear to connect the executive
departments and the senate and house
with the Washington city postofiice by the
pneumatic system and that it may then be
extended to the sub-stations and postoifices
of the large cities. He would especially
like to see tiie pneumatic system working
perfectly in Chicago by the time the
World's Fair is in progress. He favors,
wherever practicable, one-story inexpen
sive buildings for postoffices, and says that
to move out of a $600 rented
room, safe and ample for the
postal business, into a $100,000
building, where the janitor alone gets a
salary equal to more than the rent in the
former place, cannot be justified
on anv business principles. The New York
postofiice building he considers totally in
adequate for the work of the office. If the
postal revenue arising Horn letter postage
could be set aside for its proper uses, mil
lions of the letter writers of this country
might quickly be permitted to enjoy re
duced taxation on letter writing. In point
of fact, there is a cle gain of nearly $30,
000,000 from letter postage This large
profit, with the annual deficit (which last
year amounted to $5,768,300), appropriated
out of the general treasury is all swal
lowed up by the losses on other classes of
mail matter carried at less than the cost of
distribution and handling. There need be
no conjecture as to the principal item of
tiie cost in trying to drop to aone cent
rate. The amount received from letter
postage last year was something over $38,
000,000. This sum would be cut exactly
in half, and we would, therefore,
get but little over $19,000,000. The defici
ciency for the current year is likely to be
$4,530,000 which would make a total defici
ency of $23,500,000 and more. This large
deficiency under the one cent rate would
be reduced, first, by natural increase of
business second, by the stimulus of the
low rate of postage and third, by comple
tion of the pendi.ig legislation to collect
the proper postages from the sample copies
of so called newspapers, and from paper
covered books. It is estimated that by the
sample copy business over $1,000,000 is an
nually lost to the revenue and In the trans
portation of paper covered books consider
ably more than $1,000,000 is kept out of the
postal income, for the benefit of certain
book publishers. The deficiency under the
one cent rate might be still further reduced
by |the adoption of Improved devices
from time to time, which would save
time and money. The most formidable
item at present for consideration is $8,000,
000 worth of postal work performed annu
ally without pay for the executive depart
ments. If each of the departments had
paid its postage, the revenue of this de
partment would have been $8,000,000 more
annually than now. The report touches
upon the question of civil service as ap
plied to the postofiice department, favor
ing stricter examinations and certain pro
motions for merit. The revenue of the de
partment for the fiscal year, the report
shows, was $60,858,783. The expenditures
and liabilities were $66,645,083. The defi
ciency for the year was, therefore, 96,786,
300. The report closes with a tribute to
Clarkson ana other chiefs in the depart
ment.
Gen. Miles In Washington,
WASHINGTON, NOV. 29.—General Miles
arrived in Washington this evening from
Chicago and spent several hours in con
sultation with Secretary Proctor and Maj
or General Scbofield in regard to the
threatened Indian outbreak. He made a
detailed statement of the steps already
taken by him and outlined his plan of op
erations in the event of a hostile demon
stration on the part of the Indians. Sec
retary Proctor approved of his course and
told him the president had directed that he
be given the fullest discretion in the hope
that the threatened outbreak might be
averted without bloodshed if possible.
Fishing Sleet Lost.
LONDON, NOV. 28.—Additional advices
have b$en received of the disaster to a
fishing fleet off Ofoten on the Norwegian
coast. Out of 180 smacks, all of which
were compelled to cut away their rigging,
seventy were driven as'hore and battered
to pieces on the rocks. Many smaller
boats were also wrecked. It is reared that
hundreds of lives were lost. Bodies of the
victims are constantly being washed
ashore. The coast is intensely oleak and
is sparsely settled, and the survivors are
suffering greatly from exposure and star

The Irish Refugees in Chicago.
CHICAGO, Nov. 29.—Beyond question
was to two big armories on the Chicago
lake front, and not to parliament houses on
the Thames, that Irish eyes, in tbis city at
least, unanimously turned to night. Cir
cumstances without number seemed com
bined to make the occasion not notable
merely, but historic. To say nothing of
locil causes, in themselves striking, dra
matic and of far reaching importance, the
situation was a strange one. At possibly
the gravest moment in Ireland's history
six men who by common consent of the
world seemed arbitrators of her destiny
were to publicly avow their sentiments.
This was to be done not in the capital of
Ireland, but in a city 4,000 miles distant,
with an Irish population said to exceed
that of Dublin. As if to add to the extra
ordinary character of the proceedings, two
at least of the chosen six men were possi
ble successors of Ireland's uncrowned
kine himself, and to top it all, were either
of the two, John Dillon or Wiu. O'Brien, to
put foot on Irish soil, that instant would
find him, instead of welcomed toward the
cliair jf state, hurried into a stone duu
geo:.
At 7 p. m., a whole hour before the speech
making was to begin, battery armory,as
big as it is, was choked full of people. The
doors were ordered closed and all comers
headed towards the second regiment ar
mory adjoining, where an overflow meet
ing was to he held, seated in front ot the
reserved chairs, next to the platform, was
the matronly feminine figure of Parnell's
mother. At 8:25 p. in., when battery
and second regiment armory were crowded
as they never were Of fore, probably 15.000
to 20,000 people being crowded in and
about the two halls, the parliamentary
party quietly entered from the rear of bat
tery D. Six gentlemen whom
thousands in front were awaiting re
mained for the time out of view, back of
the platform, awaitinc for the meeting to
be formally opened. On motion from Mel
ville C. Stone, chairman of the committee
on arrangements, the gallant six mounted
the steps, led by John Dillon. The instant
Dillon's tall form came into view the audi
ence broke into a wild cheer which was
caught up again and again as O'Brien,
Sullivan, T. P. O'Connor. Gill and Timothy
Harrington were seen.
Mayor Cregier presided and Dillion was
the first speaker. He was greeted with
very great applause and spoke for some
time but mad« no references to Parnell.
Wm. O'Brien followed but liedid not speak
of Parnell. After a eolirction was taken,
O'Conuer spoke and Harrington closed,
neither referring in any manner to Par
nell. All were introduced to the second
meeting. The resolutions were carried
with a hurrah. They praise Parnell for
the victories won and speak encouragingly
of the future of their cause.
Tile Champion Sioux Liar.
ST. PAUL, NOV. 29.—A Pioneer Press
special from the Pine Ridge agency says:
This morning a conference was held, in
which the government was represented by
Special Agent Cooper and Dr. Royer, and
the state of South Dakota by Dr. McGilli
cuddy. The Indians were represented by
Bad Yellow Hair, Little Wound, Little
Bear and Broken Arm, their spokesman
being Little Wound. Little Wound is a
natural leader of men. He is a tall and
majestic looking Indian who has every
evidence of possessing an abundance of
brain and bravery. Many of the questions
submitted to Little Wonnd were met with
evasive answers. He often asserted dur
ing the interview that he did not want to
have war with the whites. This interview
leads to the belief that the political ma
chinery of tiie Indian department is to a
certain extent responsible for the trouble.
Little Wound was questioned by both Dr.
Royer and Dr. McGillicuddy, each appar
ently anxious to-frame their questions so
as to square their own political following
and relieve them from responsibility. Lit
tle stated during the interview that
gr.wound
host dances would never have occurred if
McGillicuddy had been agent, because
they would have consulted him before
beginning them. Little Wound also says
he is not one of the ghost dancers, although
it is certain he is prominent in councils of
the hew faith. These ghost dances, said
Little Wound, have been organized by In
dians because they have an acumuiation of
grievances and used this weird means to
exhibit their discontentment. The principal
cause of their trouble seems to be that there
is a large amount of jealousy among heri
ditary chiefs and Indians who have been
in favor with Indian agents. He also says
that his Indians have no guns or sharp
arm?. All of this was stated by Little
Wound without the semblance of
a blush, and it is the opinion at Pine
Ridge that Little Wound is the champion
liar of the Sioux nation. Last night mat
ters were moving quite rapidly around the
cavalry camp. The officers* of the Ninth
were so sure they would be ordered out
during the night that they were prepared
even to the cooking of a lunch to be car
ried in the saddle bags. A small army of
newspaper correspondents sneaked over to
the cavalry camp to be on hand at the
start, but nothing came of it all.
Pierce at Fargo.
FABGO, N. D., NOV. 28.—[Special]—Sana
tor Gilbert A. Pierce is domiciled at the
Columbia, and all last evening was busy
building up his friendship with a nnmber
of representatives and. citizens from the
lower tier of counties.
To your correspondent he expressed him
self quite confident of success in the com
ing legislature, and Beamed to be at ease
on the all Important position sought after.
It is evident, taking the stotq as a whole,
that Senator Pierce is strong in the minds
5WW
ot the people notwithstanding the wave of
discontent which in the past fortnight has
seemed to hover over the whole of North
Dakota. The people have become practi
cal once again and have given thought to a
common idea: that Senator Pierce has done
more and will do more for the state, if re
turned, than any new man could ever hope
to achieve. In a nut shell, the movement
in favor of Col. Ball of this city, can be
confined to the narrow limits of Ca-.s coun
ty and one or two scattering counties
where other aspirants reside. This is a
natural result. The Kid River valley
clamors for the senatorship, capital and
other important favors. It has ever been
thus, but to a disinterested citizen the out
come will evidently end with a strong run
in Pierce stocks. Your correspondent
looks for this tidal wave to come within a
week or so. The senator is sleeping with
his eyes wide opeu. He is perfectly cog
nizant of every move that is made in oppo
sition—and only smiles at the fruitless ex
torts of his enemies who are only strong
iu mouth and not in physical force. The.
senator handicap all comers with a rec
ord which no man need feel ashamed of. A
record which is as clear as an amethyst
and one which cannot be dulled by the
coarse rubbing it is now and has received.
Wait until the tide comes in and staud pp
higher on the boat and see the heroes fall.
RAMBLING SHOTS.
Preparing for War.
PINE RIDGE, S. D., Dec. 1.—Judge Burns
of Dead wood came in this morning, run
ning the gauntlet of the hostiles' camp. He
says he" is devoutly thankful at having
escaped with his life. There is no doubt, he
says, but that the red workers for war are
preparing thoroughly for a great struggle,
and that they have no thought of giving up
their purpose. Scouts have been sent out
to warn the settlers along
the line of the Cheyenne river.
The hostiles are on White river
at the mouth of Hay creek, seven miles
from the government herd of 5,000 cattle.
All the ranches on White river have been
robbed, ponies stolen and cattle killed.
Four spies sent out Friday itiorniiig have
not returned, and it is feared they have
been killed. Signal fires north ot White
river announce the approach of Chey
ennes. Hostiles have sent word to friend
ly Indians that all spies would be killed,
Halt-breed settlers are fleeing to the
agency, all reporting heavy losses in cattle
and ponies.
Indian ft Capture the Government Herd.
ST. PAUL, Dec. 1.—The Pioneer Press
correspordent at Pine Ridge agency, S. D.
telegraphs that paper that John Dwyer,
chief herder of the government, in whose
hands were 3,000 cattle for use in giving
rations to the Indians, with his herders,
has been compelled to keep constant
guard to prevent a surprise by the Indians,
and finally they had to leave the herds and
look out for their lives. Ot the herd of
3,000 head the Ind'ans seized ail, killing
some'for immediate use and driving the
rest into the Bad Lands for future con
sumption. These cattle were for rations
next Saturday, and the good Indians will
miss thein. As many more cattle belong
ing to the Rosebud agency have also been
captured by Indians. Chief Fast Thunder
reached Pine ltidue to night, and reports
that the Indian camp at Rosebud is receiv
ing additions from all sides, and are head
ed toward grass basin in the Bad Lands.
The Indian Rendezvous.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 —Reports received
at the war department to day from locali
ties of threatened Indians hostilities are
much less favorable than for several days
past. The dispatches received to-day indi
cate that between 1,000 and 2,000 Indians
who refused to come into the Rosebud
agency in response to the agent's orders,
have started westward toward what are
known as the Bad Lands. In their stam
pede, they have committed depredations
on the stock of frieudly Indians who went
into the agency. General Brooke tele
graph that this information is not from
his own source. He expects, however, to
have fuller information soon.

ure of debate when desired by the majority.

1878. and they are to be full legal tender.

bills tor the free coinage of silver of a

INCREASING THEIR RATIONS.
The secretary of the interior this morn
ing directed that the Sioux Indians be
supplied with increased rations sufficient
to conform to the agreement made in 1877.
Appropriations for supplies for tbe Sioux
Indians have decreased every year upon
the supposition that the Indians were be
coming more and more capable of main
taining themselves. Owing, however, to
tbe faut of the partial failure of crops for
tbe last year or two and the restlessness of
the Sioux, which is believed to be in a
measure due to reduction of rations, the
secretary ordered the increase.
