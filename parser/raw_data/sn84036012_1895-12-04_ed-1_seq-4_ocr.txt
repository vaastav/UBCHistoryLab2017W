The Message. a
Tis morning the Standard prints the t
gull test of President Cleveland's men- a
sage; it was read yesterday afternoon
In the bearing of the two houses of p'
congress. It is a letter to the people of n'
the United States rather than an of1
clot communication to the members of 0
congress. It omits the summaries for Q'
the departments, under the charge of
cabinet ofcers, which usually form a
large part of presidents' messages. It
reviews the country's foreign relations
in a routine way, without special rec
ommendation respecting the course this
country ought to pursue in given Q
cases and is without information that
is essentially new ocoerning foreign
affairs.
T Nicaraguan canal project sets
no notice; Cuba's troubles receive cot
orless mention, the message simply
adlrming the administration's determi
nation to be strictly neutral. In the t
juaemeat of the president, our govern
meat ought to own permanent rest
deuces for the use of its ambassadors
in foreign capitals; and that is all there
is of account in the message as a ree
omnmeadation or esggestion respecting
the relations of the United States to
the outside world. The tariff question
gets scant mention in the message.
The second half of the message is
devoted to a discussion of the money
question. This was written, we repeat,
not with the purpose of bringing
recommendations to the attention of I
congrees, but rather to put an anti- <
silver argument before the public. I
Manifestly this second half of the <
message Is not, ihmt hand, the work of 1
President Cleveland. The change in <
style. In composition and in expression 4
is so marked as to leave the reader to t
inter that he hardly revised it. But it
Is a compact summary of the situation
as viewed from the goldbug stand
point, whoever its author.
The public is not in the habit of read
ing these long annual messages; we
earnestly commend to every man who
wants to keep himself Informed on the
currency question the careful reading
of the second half of the message
printed this morning-it is worth while.
No matter about the goldbug sophistry
in the conclusions reached by the pres
ident, some matters of history are re
cited and much Information is given
respecting which it I. well for the in
telligent citizen to refresh his memory.
The raid on the reserve gets liberal
attention in the message-It is referred
to as "the exasperating withdrawal of
gold." This might have been stopped
long ago if Mr. Carlisle had exercised
his unquestioned right to resort to pay
ment in silver, but the administration
won't have it that way. The president
scolds about the raiding of the treas
ury. Whose fault is it? Are the
American people to blame for it or does
the responsibility rest on the little
money cliques whose schemes have
been fostered by the administration's
policy? Does the message denounce
the bankers and brokers whose specu
lations, at the expense of the reserve,
have constituted the menace out
which the message complains? There
As the one-hundred-million-reserve; Mr.
Cleveland admits that it stood virtually
intact during eleven years. But when
9[r. Carlisle came into the treasury,
Wall street began to play football with
the reserve on the astonishing scale
described in the message. How did
thui change come about? Who, outside
of administration circles, is at fault
for conditions which made it possible
to loot the reserve and loot it again
and again?
Mr. Cleveland's message takes great
pains to have It appear that every dvl
tar received by the government, as the
reswlt of the sale of bonds, went for the
seplenlshing of the reserve, and for no
oetbr purpose; he denies that any part
of the proceeds of the sale of bonds
was used to meake good the currtnt
reteeness. On that soore the public
simply hawe that an eminent demo
erti senator, who by the way Is an
eaegg of silver, made on the senate
Ccci the cha'ge which the message so
Mgsgoesly resents. The message quotes
Meo conadtion of the treemy at the
tknes when the successive bend isues
were made. as In proof ofthe fact ast
for all current needs the treasury was
ilands. This whole question is an 4
she of the quarrel that Involved ad- 4
oglalstration and antl-addmintrationf
leesoests when the Wilson tarift bill I
was approaching its crisis.
In a petronlslng way, the message in
fers that the free-colnse mean have
had two trIals In recent times and that
both kiled. It assumes. for Instance.
teat th ellver-purohaee aw of 1@ was
a sdeeme of silver's advocates. Nothing
ooutd be farther from candor. The
goINtuWe gave the Sherman act to the
ooetry, believing it would serve for
a t41ne as a esp. In Mr. Cleveland's ex
tra session every advocate of silver die
diasned allegiance to the Sherman act;
the silver men wanted it repealed and
a Just measure involving silver's full
restoration passed in ite place.
Respecting the currency. the practi
oel suggestion In the message is that
oll the treasury notes, greenbacks. cer
tlcactes and the like, be called in and
the government go out of the currency
business. Of coures, the fist withdraw
al of ***e notes and their permanent
retirement. without a substitute. would
contract the country's currency unduly.
But the plan Is to issue long-4kne bonds
with which to retire the greenbacks and
the other currency in question, and to
make these bonds the basis of circula
tion for private banks--that is to say.
for banks with which the government
bag not direct relation. This would
furnish a new basts for circulation like
that on which the national hinks were
originally organised. The message elab
orates the plan.
If It Is proposed to discontinue the
mational currency, the plan outlined In
the message Is probably as good as
any. The first thing that would foflow
this arrangement would be the disap
pearance of the reserve; there would be
no frther use for it. If we understand
the message. Its theory is that this
course would solve the whole finanmlal
question. The sliver men may be "long
haired" lunatics, but will some clear
headed goldbug tell us how that result
could possibly follow? The message
would remove a wart on the finger
whereas It Is a strong right arm that
must be saved.
It is the old story; the message pro
ceeds on the theory that the proposi
tion is to put a "fifty-cent" dollar on a
par with a dollar worth a hundred
cents. That begs the question-the
proposition is, by restoring silver to its
function, to let it have the place it
used to have as the peer and par of
gold; *what silver needs In order to
take thkt place It to have its time
honored function freely recognized.
Mr. Cleveland says that the free-coin
age men reckon from a cloudy stand
point. He insists that the advocates
of silver are wrong, and he simply
wants them to take his word for it.
There are some millions of people in
this country who will not do that
ChinN
I. Reference to Prayer.
No recent bulletins are out respect
mng the spiritual condition of Col. Rob
art Ingeroll. The prayers of the Chris
tian Endeavorers at Cleveland were
offered in his behalf Last TIhursday.
Meanwhile, however, the 4ncident has u
called out some highly sensible talk
and a good deal of suggestive com-n
ment.
The pastor of the Eudlld Avenue 4
Christian church in Cleveland said to a ]
Plain Dealer reporter: "I question the I
wisdom of the action and the theology
from whkt it springs. The conversion '1
of any soul is not simply a question of
divine will. It is chiefly a question of
personal choice. If Colonel Ingersoll
does not want to be a Christian he will
not be one."
A Presbyterian clerwrgman said: "My
opinion is that God can't convert the
devtl unless there is a change in the
deviL The supposition that God can
do what He pleases irrespective of hu
man choice is uneerlptural. If God can
save Mr. Ingersoll by force and does
not save him, God Is responsible for
sin."
Another Presbyterian clergyman con
denned the action of the Endeavorers
as inexpedient and not scriptural. It
would simply put, he said, into the
hands of Colonel Ingersoll a chlb which
'he would use against the Christian re
ligion and the effiacy of prayer. The
Plain Dealer produces plenty of testi
mony furnished by clergymen who do
not approve the course pursued by
singling out lIgersoll ter prayer and
thus advertising him.
A Queer ides.
South Carolina s constitutional eon
veutlon appears to have bees .me of the
queerest assemblages of that gird that
ever the sun shone on. The eesrks.
hle provisions as to marrtge, divorce
and suffrage it has asked he state to
incorporate into Its orgealo law are
now supplemented by a proposition,
t which the convention toesa.Sly ndopted,
to perpetuate the peculiar liquor law
now in force there and to turp over the
state's profits from its whiikey busi
t ness to the support of thb public
schools. A storm of protest is going up
t against thus linking the destinies of
the two institutions. The Cvharleston
t News and Courier puts 4t this way:
- "If the prfdits of the disc'nsaries are
e applied expressly to the support of the
e echvcels every drunkard in the state
' will be able to say -that the state profits
t by his vicious habits. The school teach
3 er who tells hia pupils that liquor
t drinking is an evil will also have to tell
c them that his salary and their educa
t- lon depend in l rge m.'asure on the
n continuance and extent of the evil. The
e more drunkenness, the more money for
0 the schools. It would be on the same
a line of policy exactly to lioetnse ganib-i
h mg houses and hesmes oi proeet~UlM
and apply the prints of s.ah lastlt
tions to the support 0t the eeels."
