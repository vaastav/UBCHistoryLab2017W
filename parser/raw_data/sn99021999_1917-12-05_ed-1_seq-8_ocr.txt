Better Team Work Ahead
-Mlaueapolle Tribune-
The "get-together" movement to co-ordinate
better the genius and energies of the Allies for
prosecution of the war is now well under way.
In Washington there has been formed a superior
war council composed of members of the cabinet
and heads of the several administrative bodies
havintr to do with the mobilization and conserva
tion of American resources. This might be called
the intra-mural phase of the movement. Over in
Paris there is in progress an inter-allied confer
ence, the purpose of which is to devise a program
for more effective joint action against the Teu
tonic foe. ;
We may expect that as a result of the broad
planning of these two bodies a great waste of
energy will be averted; in other words, that a
higher percentage of the sum total of Allied po
tentialities will be directed to the btfr business in
hand. The Washington council will deal with
groups of needs in their relation to and bearing
upon all other groups. The body will be a clear
ing house of ideas and opinions to the end that
American resources may be used so as to procure
a maximum of practical benefit It will determine
questions of priority of effort. It will see that
the war machine is so operated as to produce
men, or fuel, or munitions when and where they
ire most needed and with the least possible fric
tion or lost motion.
In a larger way the duties of the inter-allied
council will be similar. Winning of the war in
the shortest time and with a minimum sacrifice
of men and wealth is the great objective com
pared with which all other alms are incidental.
The words of President Wilson, the warning of
Premier Lloyd George and the pleadings of men
of wisdom and vision who have watched closely
the course and, progress of the war are bearing
Straight From the Shoulder t
The message delivered by President Wilson
to the reconvened congress strikes straight from
the shoulder at the vital points of the war "situ
ation. Without mincing his language be shows
that the reasons forcing us to take up arms
to repel the unprovoked aggressions of the kaiser
are even stronger now for unrelenting prose
cution of the war and that the talk of peace" by
compromise before we have gotten fairly into
swing is prompted either by cowardly fear or
traitorous disloyalty. At no time has a president
talked more plainly and more outspokenly about
enemies within the nation conspiring to sacrifice
the principles of democracy to temporary ad
vantage. The best evidence that the president is in earn
est and determined to back words with deeds,
is his ifrgent demand upon congress for immedi
ate declaration rnat a state of war exists also
with Austria-Hungary. The anomaly of fighting
the kaiser while pretending to be in friendly
peace with his chief partner acting in complete
unison with him, not only in pushing the U-boat
infamy but also in military movements against
us and our allies, is indeed intolerable. The
president offers a partial excuse for the Aus
trians that they are but tools and vassals of the
German war lords and place Turkey and Bul
garia in the same category, yet asks that action
against the last two, be deferred for reasons
which to us seem inconclusive. Unless there are
undisclosed objects to be subserved, we do not
see why we should continue on terms of peace
with any of the countries self-linked with Ger
many in its greedy scheme of world dominion;
To the people of the countries whose gov
ernments are waging war upon us, the president's
re-statement of our aims and purposes . should
be reassuring and would be if they were per
mitted to comprehend without distortion and
misrepresentation. That understanding can, how
ever, only come later when we prove to them
that justice and right and not plunder and booty
is what alone will satisfy us. It must also hearten
our own allies and strengthen them in their weak
places. For patriotic Americans, there is nothing
to do but gird for a battle to the finish.

Work for the Automobile Club to Do.
The annual meeting of the Omaha Automo
bile club has just been held. We are inclined to
think that the club is in position to exercise a
larger influence in behalf of automobile owners
and the public generally than hitherto exerted by
it. With the increasing number of automobile
owners and dealers the task of making the club
stronger and more aggressive ought not to be a
difficult one. The increase in the number of au
tomobiles owned here as well as in the large
numbers constantly coming into the city from a
wide area presents new problems to settle which
is clearly within the province f automobile clubs.
What, Omaha does in this respect should be
so well considered as to meet with the approval
of popular sentiment so that the solutions found
may serve as a guide for other cities and the state
at large. Owners have interests which should be
subserved, by the club, while pedestrians and
others having a' right to the use of the public
thoroughfares have interests which the club
should try to promote. Certainly the club could
find more effective means of safeguarding owners
against the wholesale theft of .machines by going
straight to the condition of things which permits
this systematic thievery to go, on with compara
tive immunity. The auto owners of Omaha are
intelligent enough to find a way to make most
hazardous the thriving business of stealing auto
mobiles. The broader view of the field in which
the automobile club may operate relates also to
policies of road improvement in city and country
by co-ordinating its efforts with" those, of the
county authorities and the state engineers who
are ,now grappling with that part of the problem.
Conserve Coal by Water Power Development .
t - ' i
v By far the greater part of our coal consump
tion is for the purpose of generating power to
drive the machinery used in transportation and
industrial processes. It is the complete depend-.
ence of our mills and factories, railroad and steam
ship lines upon the coal supply which makes it
8oimperative for us to have a regular and reliable
output from the mines. .While other fuels, such
as gas, natural gas, fuel, oil, gasoline and wood,
can be substituted for coal, the extent to which it
is possible, to carry this substitution is extremely
limited and at best it can serve only to relieve the
pressure for increased coal consumption. It must
not be forgotten either that the available supply
of the' substitutes likewise is strictly limited.
The one obvious way to conserve coal with
out using up some other kind of fuel is through
water power development through . harnessing
forces of nature that can be made to do the same
work with no diminution of supply. True, the
number of water power sites that may be profit
ably utilized is definitely limited, but in each case
the energy capacity can be drawn upon continu
ously and indefinitely and without danger of ex
haustion. The inevitable tendency of the higher
coal prices caused by the increased demand jg to
make feasible and profitable, water power devel
opments that previously did" not seem worth
while. - ,
Continued neglect to make these developments,
thus leaving all this fuel-saving energy run to
waste while we burn coal that cannot be replaced,
is an indictment against our American enterprise
and ingenuity and if to expedite this development
further legislation is required the legislation
should be forthcoming without delay.
A woman purist in New York, in search of
evidence to support her charges of immorality at
Camp Upton, sent a man of 40 and a girl Of 16 to
the camp to spy arougd. Barely had the pair reg
istered as man and wife, and occupied a room to
gether, when the camp police raided the apart
ment, arrested the couple and hustled them out of
the camp. Even if the morals ;of the 'camp are
not upon suspicion the prompt action of the po
lice in the case shows a better grade of morality
than the chief purist staged. , . ,
When the letter postage rate was increased in
Canada the postage stamps were made to show
that the extra 1 cent charge is a war tax and not
a charge for service. That ought to be done also
in this country, for it costs the government no
more to transport and deliver a 3-cent, letter now
than it did for a 2-cent letter last week.
Washington, D. C, Dec 3. One kind of
trained man for which the government has a most
pressing need right now is the experienced driver
of auto trucks. The truck has displaced the army
mule wherever there are roads and in many places
where there are not.. Food and ammunition go
forward on trucks from the base to the righting
line. '
It is not always the case that the man who
has spent a few months or years driving a deliv
ery truck over asphalt streets with a traffic cop
to tell him what to do is qualified for this war
work. At the front the problem is more apt to be
that of directing his machine across a roadless
piece of country, plowed by shells, littered
with scattered equipment and shreds of barbed
wire entanglement, unlit save by the oc
casional flash and glare of bursting shrapnel. And
if this war driver fails to deliver his goods at the
proper time it will be a good deal more serious
than the irritation of some customer, for the sue
cess of an attack, the lives of men, may depend
upon that delivery.
When the government need for the kind of
truck drivers who could be depended upon to de
liver the goods under war' conditions became ap
parent, a certain educator in Minneapolis, Dr. C.
A. Prosser of the Dunwoody institute, set about
the task of producing such drivers by schooling
them in their, duties.
It is probable that the average man, soldier or
citizen, would not consider such an undertaking
practicable. He would say that the drivers would
have to learn their business for the most part at
least by the hard and expensive process of trial
and error in the field. For we have all come to
look upon education as a sort of dispensable pre
liminary to the main business of life. We know
that the college man comes away from his Alma
Mater with "a head full of theories." which he
has to forget before he can become really useful,
while some practical men even regard much edu
cation as a handicap.
Dr. Prosser belongs to a new class of edu
cators who do not believe that education neces
sarily lacks the applicability to the practical ends
of life, although admitting that it generally does.
They have set themselves to the task of making
education useful. So Dr. Prosser went at the
truck driver problem in characteristic fashion by
creating a little no man s land , in a large field
near his , school. He equipped it with artificial
shell holes, with entanglements and difficulties
of all kinds and he set his novitiate truck (drivers
the task of bringing'their machines safely across
it. He exposed them to every condition which
a close study of the war in Europe indicated they
would be apt to meet in r ranee. Ana he turned
out military truck drivers that could drive.
Dr. Prosser's field of activities as a practical
iramer of men has now been enlarged to include
ubstantially the whole country; for he has been
made director of the Federal Board for Vocational
Education, which is a new department of the gov
ernment created by a recent act of congress for
the purpose of using federal funds and the fed
eral administrative machinery to help the states
install practical training courses in the schools.
In its application to civilian life it is a revolu
tionary measure and means a new opportunity
for the youth of America. That phase of it will
be treated in a separate article. For the present
the board is directing its energies to work similar
to that which Dr. Prosser undertook at Dun
woody the work of training men to fill the in
dustrial needs of the nation at war.
One of the first needs it set out to fill was that
for trained "radio operators. The signal corps
needed 15,000 of them and they were nowhere
to be found. Accordingly it turned to the board
for advice. The board at once got into communi
cation with leading schools in the states which
had formed state boards to co-operate with the
federat board and suggested that these schools
open evening classes at which men subject to the
draft might learn the business of radio-telegraphy.
The response both from the schools and from the
men was prompt. There are already between 50
to 100 schools for radio-telegraphers in opera
tion and about 3,000 men are attending them,
while the organization of these evening schools
is proceeding at a rate which has encouraged the
board to make optimistic estimates (which cannot
yet be made public) as to the number of radio
telcirraphers it can supply to the War department.
The success of this experiment has lifted the
Board for Vocational Education into the position
of a recognized part of the government war ma
chinery. Secretary of War Baker has written a
letter to the heads. of all his departments telling
them that this beard is the department to which
they should refer their problems in the matter of
trained men. And almost every department has
such problems. The quartermaster's corps for
example needs men trained in 50 different trades,
Of course, men trained in all of these trades are
found among the conscripts, but they are not
found in the proportions needed. There are too
many clerks for example, and not enough cooks.
Only by training men can the needs of the quar
termaster's corps be filled. .Hence it is more than
probable that evening classes for drafted men in
a great many trades will soon be held in all the
principal cities of the country.- There will, of
course, be nothing compulsory about these classes.
But the drafted man who chooses to learn a trade
will get more pay, and have a more interesting
and important share in the work of war. Thus a
radio' operator, instead of getting $30 a month as
does an ordinary private, receives from $51 to $81
a month. He takes part in the interesting and
difficult task of keeping the army in communica
tion with its'base. He is not, however," relegated
to a safe place behind the lines. In stringing the
wires which connect advanced positions with the
base of operations he gets all the thrills and
danger that the most daring could crave.
One of the latest branches of the war machine
to apply to the vocational board for help was the
shipping board. Everyone knows that "ships will
win the war," and the trouble that we are having
in getting them built. Now that the difficulty of
deciding who is to supervise the job has been set
tled, there comes up the even more distressing
problem of who is going to do it. In a word,
the shipping board cannot get the labor it needs.
It is in 'special need of ship riveters. There are
lots of riveters in the country who have been
trained in riveting the structural iron used in
large buildings, but the structural work requires
a different method of rivetinir from that used in
building ships, and this difference of method
means that structural riveters cannot generally
be put on ship work without some special train
ing. The vocational board has tackled this prob
lem by putting into the field an agent who is to
gather all possible data. He will find out how
many riveters trained in building work are avail
able and what additional training they will re
quire to make them useful in ship building. Then
the board will proceed to the organization of
schools where the training can be applied.
The drafted man who wants to serve his
country in a trained capacity should keen in touch
with the superintendent of evening schools in his
city or in the large city nearest his home. Even
though no course may be offered which seems to
fit his aptitudes, such a course may be offered be
fore he is called. This is his opportunity to learn
something out of war besides the art of killmg,
to serve with his brain as well as with his body.
