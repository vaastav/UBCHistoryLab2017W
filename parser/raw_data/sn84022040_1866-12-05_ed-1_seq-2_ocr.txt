THE DAILY APPEAL

WXDHTIDAT HORHIXG. DEC. 5. 1866
rSEPAKIRO TO AVOID BSEAHM
AHEAD roHGRE3SIOAL CAUCUS.
YankreUtn is what Andy Johnson
asl William II. Seward are impatient
of io their opposition to the radicals in
Congress. The growing political con
sequence of Xew England notions is
what pesters the Secretary of State.
Sewjr ! b'.nks Yankeeiom vulgar and
presumptuous ; and A. Johnson, in bis
' nmble" way, hates il and they both
hare set their hearts spainst it because
it U irrepressible r.nd utignllibie. But
it is a tough and aggressive bramble, is
Yaokeeism, and neither vulgar Andy
nor sneering William can root it out J
nor cbokt it down, nor scare it into nn-
obstrnsiveness, any more than those
other hater of it, the alive holders and
secessionists did. And it will lire and
spread in spite of its unpopularity with
those shabby genteel seedling!, the
"Knickerbockers" whose musty gen
tility make Seward, like them, more
European than American in their favor
ite ideas ; and in spite of the blackguard
crusade which floundering Andy has
sought to inangurate against it.
Ttioe horribly ungenel fellows,
" the radical " hare commenced work
again ; and ther seem to disregard the
delicacies of social amenities altogether.
They hare berun slashing away at
the IIumMe Individual's appointments ;
and they have actually proposed a law
which is designed to neutralize my
policy" altogether. They r .t only ad
vise the Senate to reject all the Presi
dent's political appointment?, but thev
have actually gone so far as to propose
a law changing the time for the conven
ing of Congress so as to make it p js
aible for the 40th Congress to meet on
the 4tb of March next, thereby prevent
ing a recess in which Andy might play
aome vextitiously high pranks to the in
dignation, if not the discomfiture, of
'.he radicals in and out of Congress.
Those lymphatic gentlemen with
whom the g iut is nn anxioii.ly hoped
lor attainment and whose affected ele
gance of breeding is diluted into a pro
per Consistency by virtue of a "con
erratum which conserves nothing
better than its own profitless conceits,
will no doubt feel sadly shocked at the
renewal by Congress of their measures
'or bringing our dpluded Sonthern
m iheren to an open understanding of
'.he sturJy determination of the Yan
sees to reconstruct this Xation after
their own severe model. It so happens
that the rebels have mad" it a matter of
history that '- the Yankees " is th
same of the foes who whipped them ;

TIXLDI5S TO THE LOGIC OF EVE3TT3
t is a sulky dignity that possesses the
old, nionldr, bad sm-llir;r aristocrats of
the South. When that troublesome ami
eapensire faculty once g'ts np, it is
mighty hard for it to come dnwn When
it sulks, it is chronic and inrnrahle

is nothing like it but a suddenly scared
tnrkey gobbler.
The S-mth was scared and humbled

timid and very penitr nt when Surratt
and Payne were hung; it suddenly for
got its at.j-ctiiess when Johnson ytr
milted some of its old beli-wetuers to

tinper to bold the Yankees in contempt
lft it seems to have forgotten huts
hadly it was whipped a year ago last
April. Kut something or other is grn
dually but very surely takme that vain
boasting, eiopt conceit aat of tbe(
SoulbsTners. A people cannot live
npon air, and this chivalry business, now
that slavery is dead, is as utterly want
ing in substance as the vapors that fan
the top of Mount Shasta. Already is
the question of impartial suffrage being
seriously discussed in States that were
among the first to pass ordinances of
secession. The proposition to erect the
negro to a full citizen, with the right of
suffrage entrusted to bim, is being moot
ed, without danger to its advocates, in
communities, where, five years ago, a
scheme of even gradual emancipation
would have secured its agitator a coat
of tar and feathers. ' Reconstruction"
is progressing, marvellously, grievously
hindered as it is ; and it is a pretty safe
conclusion that the whole ' Confedera
cy " will slip away from Johnson and
throw itself upon the clemency of Con
gress, begging to go ta the furthest ex
tremes of the requirements of radical
ism, long before the 40lb Congress shall
ave ended its term. Practical sense
nd an appreciation of the logic of
events are being rapidly developed at
the South ; and when they once get the
better of that sodden dignity that we
ave alluded to, and of that savage
passion wbich is simply rumanism.
Southerners will be fitted for a partici
pation in, aud a wholesome enjoyment
f the form of National government
which tbey struggled so long, so bitter
ly and so vainly to destroy.
BT TATE TELEGHAPH-
From the Gold Hill News of yesterday.
Jfiw York, December 3. The Her-
Id's Washingtou special dispatch says:
Mr. Botitwell, of Massachusetts, at the
Republican Caucns last night, said that
a Special Committee should be appoiut-
d, whose duty it would be to inquire
nto the subject of the impeachment of
he President; and the suggestion met
n-ith the hearty co-operation of a!!, lie
will introduce a resolution at the earliest
opportunity after the assembling of
,'ongress, for the appointment of a Joint
Committee to investigate the conduct
and course of the President, and report
what action it will he necessary for
Cong'ess to take. It is lo stated in
Washington, that Mr. Sctienck, of thio.
will introduce a bill soon, to assemble
he Fortieth Congress on the 5th of
March.
The World's Washington special says:
The President, iu his message to Con
gress, adheres firmly to his restoration
olicy, and argues at length in favor of
he immediate admission to Congress i f
luly qualified local representatives from
the South.
Of Foreign Affairs, he says with great
effort the progress toward the adjust
ment of the Alabama question has be n
slow, owing, in some deeree. to the
arge in the I'.ritish Minstry. But
matters in that regard look f ivorable.
He states that France has not yet
complied with her agreement to ta-ke
iirr troops out of Mexico, but has in
timated a postpunmeot until Snrine-
fliis the Government has remonstrated
eainst, but the President says no reply
has been received from the Emperor as
(o what he will do.
A satisfactory adjustment is hoped
far.
General Sherman has merely pone to
Mexico in an advisory capacity for Min-
s:er Campbell.
The message is silent on the questions
of the Mexican protectorate and treaties.
tad makes no allusion to Maximilian
whatever.
The Hetald's Milledgeville (Georgia)
corrrspondent Slates tliat the reasons lor
trie rejection of the Constitutional
mcnimnt by the Georgia Legislature
were, that there were fiO guarantiee
iliven that a restoration of the State to
tae Union would f.dlow its adoption.
and that the people consider it the bigl t
of ingratitude to disfranchise tho.-e vtho
were lately their sol. tiers. They have
begun to look calmly at the possibility
of i tZTn suffrage as a means of re ad
mission: but it is still reioltug to
them.
A biil is under consideration in the
Georgia Legislature lookirg to the es
tablishment of common schools for
whites and blacks throughout the State,
and it is I r ibah it w.li be passed.
Emigration from the North is encour
aged, and much capital bus already
flowed in from that section.
Naw Yoai, December 3 Tbs Times
Washington Special dispatck says of the
arrest of John n . Surratt s
It appears, at we learn from official
sources, that Surratt. was arrested in
Italy, as heretofore reported, whilst in
the Papal Zouaves, and afterwards es
caped. The Pope promptly gave the
necessary orders for his arrest npon the
request of our Minister," Mr. King, not
withstanding there was no treaty be
tween the United States and the Papal
Governments binding the latter to grant
the request. Sarrati "as traced after
bis escape to Egypt and arrested as
stated."
As incidental to the above, it may be
stated that Mr. Rcutwell, of Massachu
setts, in the caucus, on Saturday even
ing, made the statement that the Gov
ernment had known of the whereabouts
of Surratt for six months.
Wasrmgto, December 3. The fol
lowing has been received at the State
Department by the Cable :
I have arrested John H. Surratt, one
of President Lincolu s assassins. No
doubt of bis identity.
(Signed), Chas. IIalk,
C S. Consul-Geoeral at Alexandria, in
Kgvpt.
Letters from the City of Mexico have
been received here, dated Nov. 10th,
stating the fact that General Bazaine
had given arms and ammunitions to the
Mexican Liberals, and promised them
that tbey should not be interfered witb
by the French forces, provided they
pronounced for General Ortega, and
proclaimed bim as President of Mexico.
BT THE ATLANTIC CABLE.
Livebpool, Dec. 2. There are indi
cations here of troub'e from the Irish
population. Steps are being taken by
ibe Government with a view to its
prompt suppresion. The counter
manding of an order for volunteers to
leave fur Ireland was made in this con
nection. Their services will be re
quired at borne.
LoD05, Sunday Evening, Dec. 2
Colonel Leary, a wrll-knowu prominent
Fenian, has been arrested by the Gov
ernment officers here and placed io
P.lackwell Prison, under a strong
guard.
Dibux, Dec. 2. Tliere is a great ex
citemeut here relative to the activity ot
Hnglisb otlicials io making arrests ot
persons believed lobe implicated in the
Fenian movement. A great many ar
rests have been made all over the
country, and they grow more numerous
nourly.
Latkh fkusi Pahkasagat. The Reese
River Reveille of November 30th has the
following late nutters of interest relating to
Puliranagnt :
The prospeets of this remote and hitherto
inacccsMble district, are just now very en
couraging. Late explorations have opened a
shoit and direct route from Austin to the
very core of that ditriut, so easy and so free
from the ordinary natural obstacles, that it is
said loaded wagons will experience no diffi
culty in making the trip in a short time.
Instead of lay his; "the other iile of Jordan,"
ith a yanuilll; "death valKy" between it
and the minim; communities of the central
aiidwtstern portions of the State, it is found
to be e.isilv accessible, over a better natural
road than conuectg Austin and irginia Citv.
and la consequence it splendid property and
surroundings will soon become known and
appreciated. " e have lust had a brief
conversation with Mr. T. L. Lane, who ar
rivrd in this city over the new route a few
dat s asto, after a number of mouths residence
in Pahranagat, in the course of which we
learned that the five stamp mill of the Pioneer
Company, erected under the superintendence
of Mr. Raymond, was completed and would
tie put in luotion the day af er his party left,
that is, on the 19th inst. It is designed to
roast the ore, and reverberatorv furnaees of
the usual model were in the course of erection.
Among hundieds of fine locations, the Illi
nois ledoe at present stands foremost, mainly
perhaps because it is more fully developed,
and has been cotiipelh d to reveal glimpses of
ts vast snd lonjr hidden treasure. Seventy
five to one hundred tons of its rieh mineral
have been extracted readv for the null. Mr.
Lane bioii"lit with him a number of tine
specimens of the ores of the district, which
are more various and as rici as c.n
he obtained in any section of the region.
In his unique collcciion tin re is a large
and beautiful crystal of salt procured from
a mountain eighty miles south of the district
of Pahranavat. Apparently the whole
mountain is salt siiiiieient to preserve Mor-
motidoni, it to sweeten the " filthy pool" of
polities amen they oiast and breiik upnuh
powder, as grauite is broken up. The
specimen in tiie hands of Mr. Line is about
half an inch thick and nearly two inches
bro, .1, and is beautifully translucent. We
U arn that Mr. Lane iroes westward for the
puriMise of procuring a portable saw mill to
lake into the district for general use, and to
facilitate his plan for supplwuu tuc tirinciiial
minim? camp of Silver Canyon with water,
the natural supply of nhich is scarce. The
prospects are brighter than ever, and it is to
be hoped its patient prospectors will jet re
ceive their reward.
