OLLOWING is the message of
President Wilson delivered at a
joint sess: .. of the senate and
bouse at the beginning of tbe
i- Sixty-fourth congress:
Gentlemen of the Congress—Since I
last bad tbe privilege of addressing
you on tbe state of tbe Union tbe war
of nations on tbe otber side of tbe sea,
which bad then .only begun to disclose
Its portentous proportions, has extend
ed its threatening and sinister scope
until it has swept within its flame
i!|eome portion of every quarter of tbe
fe*lobe, not excepting our own bemi
vpbere, has altered tbe whole face of
I International affairs, and now presents
ia prospect of reorganization and re
^construction sucb as statesmen and
peoples have never been called upon
to attempt before.
Tbe president tells bow this country
practiced neutrality and declares that
he hopes that when the time comes
for readjustment and recuperation this
country will be of infinite service. Re
ferring to Central and South American
problems, the president declares tbat
fit we should retain unabated tbe spirit
]|l which has Inspired us throughout the
-whole nfe
«$
0f our
tj
government and
-which was so frankly put into words
by President Monroe.
We have been put to tbe test in the
case of Mexico, and we have stood the
test Whether we have benefited Mex
ico by the course we have pursued re
jnainB to be seen. Her fortunes are in
own bands. But we have at least
(proved that we will not take advan
tage of her in her distress and under
take to Impose upon her an order and
government of our own choosing. Lib
erty is often a fierce and Intractable
thing, to which no bounds can be set
jand to which no bounds of a few
Man's choosing ought ever to be set
^Svery American who bas drank at
jtfca true fountains of principle and tra
dition most subscribe without reserva
3tton to the high doctrine of the Vir
ginia bill of rights, which in tbe great
in which oar government was set
was everywhere among us accept
'ed as tbe creed of free men. That doc
tin Is, "That government is or ought

nation or community that "of
«all the various modes and forms of

capable of producing the greatest de
%ne of happiness and safety and Is
most effectually secured against tbe
•danger of maladministration, and that
when any government shall be found
Inadequate or contrary to these pur
poses a majority of the community
hath an Indubitable, inalienable and
Indefeasible right to reform, alter or
mbollsh It in sucb manner as shall be
Judged most conducive to tbe public
weal." We have unhesitatingly ap

-Vt Mexico and now bopefully await
^tbe rebirth of tbe troubled republic,
which had so much of which to purge
Itself and so little sympatby from any
-outside quarter in the radical but nec
-aasary process. We will aid and be
friend Mexico, but we will not coerce
.fcer, and our course with regard to her
tooght to be sufficient proof to all Amer
ica that we seek no political suserainty
•Or selfish control.
PAN-AMERICANISM HAS
NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT.
Itinomic Adjustments Inevitable With
in the Next Generation.
Tbe moral is that tbe states of Amer
ica are not hostile rivalB, but co-op
erating friends, and that their grow
lag sense of community of Interest,
alike In matters political and In mat
ters economic, is likely to give them a
new significance as factors In interna
tional affairs and in tbe political his
tory of tbe world. It presents them as
la a very deep and true sense a unit

tending together because thinking to
gether, quick With common sympathies
common ideals. Separated, they
subject to All tbe cross currents of
the confused politics of a world of hos
tile rivalries United in spirit and pur
pose, tbey cannot be disappointed of
their peaceful destiny.
This is pan-Americanism. It bas none
the spirit of empire in it. It is the
casbodiment, the effectual embodiment,

PICTURE.
(From snapshot taken on Nov. 26.)
of individual liberty and of tbe free
labor tbat supports life and tbe un
censored thought that quickens it.
Conquest and dominion are not in our
reckoning or agreeable to our princi
ples. But just because we demand un
molested development and tbe undis
turbed government of our own lives
upon our own principles of right and
liberty, we resent, from whatever
quarter it may come, the aggression we
ourselves will not practice. We insist
upon security in prosecuting our self
chosen lines of national development.
We do more than tbat We demand it
also for others. We do not confine our
enthusiasm for Individual liberty and
free national development to the Inci
dents and movements of affairs which
affect only ourselves. We feel it wher
ever there is a people that tries to walk
in these difficult paths of Independence
and right. From the first we have
made common cause with all partisans
of liberty on this side tbe sea and have
deemed It as Important that oar neigh
bors should be free from all outside
domination as that we ourselves should
be have set America aside as a whole
for the uses of independent nations and
political freemen.
Oat of sucb thoughts grow all oor'
policies. We regard war merely as a
means of asserting the rights of a peo
ple against aggression. And we are
as fiercely jealous of coercive or dicta
torial power within our own nation
as of aggression from without We
will not maintain a standing army ex
cept for uses which are as necessary
in times of peace as in times of war.
SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN
FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE.
Increase Standing Regular Force—Four
Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiers.
But war has never been a mere mat
ter of men and guns. It is a thing
of disciplined might If our citizens
are ever to fight effectively upon a
sudden summons, they must know
how modern figbting Is done, and what
to do when tbe summons comes to
render themselves Immediately avail
able and immediately effective. And
tbe government must be their servant
in this matter, must supply them with
tbe training they need to take care of
themselves and of it The military
arm of their government which they
will not allow to direct them, they may
properly use to serve them and make
their Independence secure, and not
their own Independence merely, bat
tbe rights also of those with whom
they have made common cause, should
tbey also be put In jeopardy. They
must be fitted to play tbe great role
in the world, and particularly In this
hemisphere, for which tbey are quali
fied by principle and by chastened am
bition to play.
It Is with tbese Ideals in mind tbat
tbe plans of the department of war for
more adequate national defense were
conceived which will be laid before
you, and which I urge you to sanction
and put into effect as soon as they can
be properly scrutinized and discussed. I
Tbey seem to me the essential first
steps, and tbey seem to me for the
present sufficient
They contemplate an Increase of the
standing force of the regular army
from Its present strength of 5,023 offi
cers and 102,985 enlisted men of all
services to a strength of 7,136 officers
and 134.707 enlisted men, or 141,843
all told, all services, rank and file, by
the addition of fifty-two companies of
coast artillery, fifteen companies of en
gineers, ten regiments of Infantry, four
regiments of field artillery and four
aero squadrons, besides 750 officers re
quired for a great variety of extra
service, especially tbe all important
doty of training the citisen force of
which I aball presently speak, TBS non
commissioned officers for service la
drill, recruiting and the like and tbe
neceasaiy quota of enlisted men for
the quartermaster corps, the hospital
ordnance department and
auxiliary strikes, mat

are the additions necessary to render
the army adequate for its present du
ties, duties which it bas to perform
not only upon our own continental
coasts and borders and at our interior
army posts, but also In the Philippines,
in tbe Hawaiian Islands, at tbe isth
mus and in Porto Rico.
By way of making the country ready
to assert some part of its real power
promptly and upon a larger scale
should occasion arise tbe plan also
contemplates supplementing the army
by a force of 400,000 disciplined citi
zens, raised in increments of 133,000 a
year throughout a period of three
years. This it is proposed to do by a
process of enlistment under which the
serviceable men of tbe country would
be asked to bind themselves to serve
with tbe colors for purposes of train
ing for short periods throughout three
years and to come to the colors at call
at any time throughout an additional
"furlough" period of three years. This
force of 400,000 men would be pro
vided with personal accouterments as
fast as enlisted and their equipment
for the field made ready to be supplied
at any time. They would be assem
bled for training at stated intervals at
convenient places in association with
suitable units of the regular army.
Their period of annual tcainlng would
not necessarily exceed two months In
the year.
The president says It Is up to the
patriotic young men of the country to
respond to this call.
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
FOR GREATER NAVY.
Always Looked to It as Our First and
Chief Line of Defense.
The program which will be laid be
fore yon by tbe secretary of tbe navy
is similarly conceived. It Involves only
a shortening of tbe time within which
plans long matured shall be carried
out bnt It does make definite and ex
plicit a program which has heretofore
been only Implicit, held in tbe minds of
the committees on naval affairs and
disclosed In tbe debates of tbe two
booses, bat nowheif formulated or for
mally, adopted. It seems to me very
clear that It will be to tbe advantage
of tbe country for tbe congress to adopt
a comprehensive plan for putting the
navy upon a final footing of strength
and efficiency and to press that plan
to completion within the next five
years. We have alwaya looked to the
navy of tbe country as our first and
chief line of defense we have always
seen It to be our manifest course of
prudence to be strong on the seas.
Year by year we have been creating a
navy which now ranks very high In
deed among tbe navies of tbe maritime
nations. We should now definitely de
termine how we shall complete what
we have begun and bow soon.
Tbe program to be laid before you
contemplates tbe construction within
five years of ten battleships, six battle
cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty de
stroyers, fifteen fleet submarines,
eighty-five coast submarines, four gun
boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni
tion Bhips, two fuel oil ships and one
repair ship, it Is proposed that of this
number we shall tbe first year provide
for tbe construction of two battleships,
two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers,
fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines,
twenty-five coast submarines, two gun
boats and one hospital ship the second
year two battleships, one scout cruiser,
ten destroyers, four fleet submarines,
fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat
and one fuel oil ship the third year
two battleships, one battle cruiser, two
scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet
submarines and fifteen coast subma
rines the fourth year two battleships,
two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers,
ten destroyers, two fleet submarines,
fifteen coast submarines, one ammuni
tion ship and one fuel oil ship, and
tbe fifth year two battleships, one bat
tle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten de
stroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen
coast submarines, one gunboat, one am
munition ship and one repair ship.
Tbe secretary of tbe navy is asking
also for tbe Immediate addition to the
personnel of tbe navy of 7,500 sailors.
2,500 apprentice seamen and 1,500 ma
rines. This increase wonld be suffi
cient to care for the ships which are
to be completed within the fiscal year
1917 and also for the number of men
which must be put in training to man
tbe 8hips which will be completed
eariy in 1918. It is also necessary that
the number of midshipmen at the Na
val academy at Annapolis should be
Increased by st least 900 In order that
tbe force of officers should be more
rapidly added to. and authority Is ask
ed to appoint, for engineering dutlec
only, approved graduates of engineer
kg colleges, and for sen Ice In the avi
ation corps a certain number of men
taken from civil life.
If this fun program should be carried
out we should have built or buHdlng la
1881, according to the estimates of sar
vival and standards of el—...
followed by the general bear* of wwfctog
department, an effective navy consist
ing of 27 battleships of the first line, 0
battle cruisers, 25 battleships of the
second line, 10 armored cruisers, 13
scout cruisers, 5 first class cruisers, 3
second class cruisers, 10 third class
cruisers, 108 destroyers, 18 fleet sub
marines, 157 coast submarines, mon
itors, 20 gunboats, 4 supply ships, 15
fuel ships, 4 transports, 3 tenders to
torpedo vessels, 8 vessels of special
types and two ammunition sbips. This
would be a navy fitted to our needs
and worthy of our traditions.
But armies and instruments of war
are only part of what has to be con
sidered if we are to consider the su
preme matter of national self sufficien
cy and security in all its aspects.
There are other great matters which
will be thrust upon our attention
whether we will or not There is, for
example, a very pressing question of
trade and shipping involved in this
great problem of national adequacy.
It is necessary for many weighty rea
sons of national efficiency and devel
opment that we should have a great
merchant marine. The great merchant
fleet we once used to make us ricb,
that great body of sturdy sailors who
used to carry our flag into every sea,
and who were tbe pride and often tbe
bulwark of the nation, we have almost
driven out of existence by lnexcusablo
neglect and Indifference and by a hope
lessly blind and provincial policy of
so called economic protection. It is
high time we repaired our mistake and
resumed our commercial Independence
on the seas.
With a view to meeting these press
ing necessities of our commerce and
availing ourselves at tbe earliest possi
ble moment of tbe present unparalleled
opportunity of linking the two Ameri
cas together In bonds of mutual inter
est and service, an opportunity which
may never return again if we miss it
now, proposals will be made to the
present congress for the purchase or
construction of ships to be owned and
directed by tbe government similar to
those made to tbe last congress, but
modified In some essential particulars.
1 recommend these proposals to you
for your prompt acceptance with tbe
more confidence because every month
that has elapsed since the former pro
posals were made bas made the ne
cessity for such action more and more
manifestly Imperative. Tbat need was
then foreseen. It Is now acutely felt
and everywhere realized by those for
whom trade Is waiting, but who can
find no conveyance for their goods. 1
am not so much Interested in tbe par
ticulars of the program as I am In
taking Immediate advantage of the
great opportunity which awaits us If
we will bat act in this emergency. In
this matter, as In all others, a spirit of
common counsel should prevail, and
out of it should come an early solu
tion of this pressing problem.
SHOULD AGREE ON POLICY
IN THE PHILIPPINES.
#.. rvr v—
Rsosmiwsnds Early Adoption of Meas
ures Giving Them Fuller Justice,
Tbe president recommends tbe early
adoption of bills for the alteration and
reform of tbe government of tbe Phil
ippines and for rendering fuller polit
ical Justice to the people of Porto Blco,
which were submitted to tbe Sixty
third congress. The president refers
to the Increased cost of carrying out
the plans for the armed forces of tbe
nation and tells of tbe fiscal problems
confronting tbe government
On tbe 90th of June last there was
an available balance In tbe general
fund of tbe treasury of $104,170,105.78.
Tbe total estimated receipts for tbe
year 191G, on tbe assumption that the
emergency revenue measure passed by
the last congress will not be extended
beyond Its present limit the 31st of
December, 1915, and that tbe present
duty of 1 cent per pound on sugar will
be discontinued after the 1st of May,
1910, will be $670,305,500. Tbe balance
of Jane last and tbese estimated rev
enues come therefore to a grand total
of $774,535,005.78. The total estimated
disbursements for tbe present fiscal
year. Including twenty-five millions for
the Panama canal, twelve millions for
probable deficiency appropriations and
$50,000 for miscellaneous debt redemp
tions, will be 1753,891,000, and tbe bal
ance In the general fund of the treas
ury will be reduced to $20,644,005.78.
Tbe emergency revenue act If contin
ued beyond Its present time limitation
would produce daring tbe half year
then remaining about forty-one mil
lions. Tbe duty of 1 cent per pound
on sugar If continued would produce
during tbe two months of tbe fiscal
year remaining after tbe 1st of May
about fifteen millions. Tbese two sums,
amounting together to fifty-six mil
lions, If added to the revenues of tbe
second half of tbe fiscal year would
yield tbe treasury at tbe end of the
year an available balance of 176.644,
00G.7&
Tbe additional revenues required to
carry out tbe program of military and
naval preparation of which I have
spoken would, as at present estimated,
be for the fiscal year 1917 $93,800,000.
Those figures, taken with the figures
for tbe present fiscal year which I
have already given, disclose oar finan
cial problem for tbe year 1917. As
suming tbat tbe taxes Imposed by the
emergency revenue act and tbe pres
ent duty on sugar are to be discontin
ued and tbat the balance at the close
of tbe present fiscal year will be only
S20.644.005.78. that the disbursements
for tbe Panama canal will again be
about 925.000,000 and tbat tbe addi
tional expenditures for the army and
navy, are authorized by tbe congress.
tbe deficit In the general fund of the
treasury on the 30th of Jane, 1917,
will be nearly $238,000,0001 To this
sum at least «MM»OUOOO
for the
nppiuwfp
How shall we obtain the new rev
enue? We are frequently reminded
tbat there are many millions of bonds
which the treasury is authorized under
existing law to sell to reimburse the
sums paid out of current revenues for
tbe construction of the Panama canal,
and it is true that bonds for the
amount of $222,432,000 are now avail
able for that purpose. Prior to 1913
$138,000,000 of these bonds had ac
tually been sold to recoup the expendi
tures at the isthmus, and now con
stitute a considerable item of the pub
lic debt But I for one do not believe
that tbe people of this country approve
of postponing the payment of their
bills. Borrowing money is shortsight
ed finance. It can be justified only
when permanent things are to be ac
complished which many generations
will certainly benefit by and which it
seems hardly fair tbat a single genera
tion should pay for. The objects we
are now proposing to spend money for
cannot be so classified, except in the
sense that everything wisely done may
be said to be done in tbe interest of
posterity as well as in our own. It
seems to me a clear dictate of pru
dent statesmanship and frank finance
that in what we are now, I hope, about
to undertake we should pay as we go.
The people of the country are entitled
to know just what-burdens of taxation
they are to carry and to know from the
outset now. The new bills should be
paid by Internal taxation.
NATION'S SECRET FOES
SHOULD BE CRUSHED.
Gravest Dangsr to Country Comes
From Within Our Own Borders.
The president says tbat tbe precise
reckonings of the problem to be met
are set forth In tbe report of the secre
tary of the treasury.
I have spoken to yon today, gentle
men, upon a single theme, tbe thor
ough preparation of tbe nation to care
for Its own security and to make sure
of entire freedom to play tbe Impar
tial role In this hemisphere and In tbe
world which we all believe to have
been providentially assigned to It I
have had In my mind no thought of
any Immediate or particular danger
arising oat of oar relations with other
nations. We are at peace with all the
nations of the world, and there Is rea
son to hope that no question In con
troversy between this and other gov
ernments will lead to any serious
breach of amicable relations, grave as
somfe differences of attitude and policy
bave been and may yet turn out to be.
I am sorry to say that tbe gravest
threats against oar national peace and
safety have been uttered within our
own borders. There are.cltizens of the
United States, I blush to admit, born
under other flags, but welcomed onder
oar generous naturalisation laws to tbe
full freedom and opportunity of Amer
ica, who bave poured the poison of dis
loyalty into the Teiy arteries of our
national life, who bave sought to bring
the authority and good name of our
government into contempt to destroy
our industries wherever they thought
it effective for their vindictive pur
poses to strike at them and to debase
our politics to tbe uses of foreign In
trigue. Their number Is not great as
compared with tbe whole number of
those sturdy hosts by which our na
tion has been enriched In recent gen
erations out of virile foreign stocks,
bat it is great enough to bave brought,
deep disgrace upon us and to bave
made it necessary that we should
promptly make use of processes of law
by which we may be purged of their
corrupt distempers.
America never witnessed anything
like this before. It never dreamed it
possible that men sworn Into Its own
citizenship, men drawn out of great
free stocks sucb as supplied some of
the best and strongest elements of tbat
little, but how heroic, nation tbat in a
high day of old staked Its very life to
free Itself from every entanglement
tbat had darkened tbe fortunes of the
older nations and set up a new stand
ard here—that men of auch origins and
sucb free choices of allegiance would
ever turn in malign reaction against
the government and people who bad
welcomed and nurtured them and seek
to make this proud country once mor
a botbed of European passiou. A IK
tie while ago such a thing would bave
seemed Incredible. Because it was in
credible we made no preparation for
it We would bave been almost
ashamed to prepare for It* as if we
were auspicious of ourselves, our own
comrades and neighbors! But tbe uglr
and Incredible thing bas actually come
about and we are without adequate
federal laws to deal with It I urge
you to enact such laws at tbe earliest
moment and feel that In doing
so I am urging you to do nothing less
than save tbe honor and eelf respect
of tbe nation. Sucb creatures of pn~
disloyalty and anarchy must be
oat They are not many, but
they are Infinitely malignant and the
of oar power should cloee over
them at once. They have formed plots
to destioi froprftf. they have entered
m$y-
dude tbe usual deficiency estimates In |nto conspiracies against the neutrality
1917, and these additions would make
t)f
the government, tbey have sought
a total deficit of some $297,000,000. If
tbe present taxes should be continued
throughout this year and the next,
however, there would be a balance in
the treasury of some $70,500,000 at
the end of the present fiscal year and
a deficit at the end of the next year of
only some $50,000,000, or, reckoning in
$02,000,000 for deficiency appropria
tions and a safe treasury balance at
the end of the year, a total deficit of
some $112,000,000. The obvious moral
of tbe figures is tbat it is a plain coun
sel of prudence to continue all of tbe
present taxes or their equivalents and
confine ourselves to the problem of
providing $112,000,000 of new revenue
ratber than $297,000,000.
to pry into every confidential trans
action of tbe government in order to
serve interests alien to our own. It Is
possible to deal with these things very
effectually. I need not suggest the
terms in which tbey may be dealt with.
I wish that it could be said that only
a few tnen, misled by mistaken senti
ments of allegiance to tbe governments
under which they were born, bad been
guilty of disturbing the self possession,
and misrepresenting the temper and
principles of the country during these
days of terrible war, when it would
Beem that every man who was truly an
American would instinctively make it
his duty and bis pride to keep the
scales of judgment even and prove him
self a partisan of no nation but his
own. But it cannot. There are some
men among us and many resident
abroad who, though born and bred in
the United States and calling them
selves Americans, have so forgotten
themselves and their honor as citizens
as to put their passionate sympatby
with one or tbe otber side'in the great
European conflict above their regard
for tbe peace and dignity of the United
States. Tbey also preach and practice
disloyalty. No laws, I suppose, can
reach corruptions of the mind and
heart, but 1 should not speak of others
without also speaking of these and ex
pressing tbe even deeper humiliation
and scorn which every self possessed
and thoughtfully patriotic American
must feel when he thinks of them and
of the discredit they are dally bringing
upon us.
What is more Important is that the
industries and resources of tbe country
should be available and ready for.
mobilization. It Is the more Impera
tively necessary, therefore, that wo
should promptly devise means for do
ing what we bave not yet done—tbat
we should give intelligent federal aid
and stimulation to Industrial and voca
tional education, as we bave long done
In the large field of our agricultural
Industry tbat at the same time that
Many conditions about which we
have repeatedly legislated are. being
altered from decade to decade. It Is
evident under oar very eyes and, are
likely? to 'chalge even more "rapidly1?
and mor# radically In the days Imme
diately ahead of as when peace ha»
returned to the world and tbe nations
of Europe once more take up their

tbe energy of those who must bestir
themselves to build anew.
REGULATIONS TO MEET
RAILROAD PROBLEM.
Needed to Make Linee More Uesful
Servants of Country.
In the meantime may I make this
suggestion? Tbe transportation prob
lem is an exceedingly serious and
pressing one In this country. There
bas from time to time of late been rea
son to fear that our railroads would
aot much longer be able to cope with
it successfully, as at present equipped
ana co-ordinated. I suggest tbat it
would be wise to provide for a jpm
mission of inquiry to ascertain by a
thorough canvass of the. whole ques
tion whether our laws as at present
framed and administered are as serv
iceable as they might be in the solu
tion of tbe problem. It Is obviously
a problem that lies at tbe very foun
dation of our efficiency as a people.
Such an Inquiry ought to draw oat
every circumstance and opinion worth
considering, and we need to know
all sides of the matter If we mean to
do anything In tbe field of federal leg
islation.
No one, 1 am sore, would wish to
take any backward step. The regula
tion of the railways of the country by
federal commission baa bad admirable
reonlts and has fully justified the
hopes and expectations of those by
whom tbe policy of regulation was
originally proposed. Tbe question Is
not. What should we undo? It Is
whether there Is anything else we can
do that wonld supply as with effective
means, in the very process of regu
lation, for bettering tbe conditions un
der which the railroads ate operated
and for making them more useful serv
ants of the country as a whole It
seems to me tbat It might be tbe part
of wisdom, therefore, before further
legislation in this field Is attempted,
to look at tbe whole problem of coor
dination and efficiency In tbe fall light
of a fresh assessaient of drcanataaea
and opinion, aa a galde to dsdlhig wMa
the several parts of It
