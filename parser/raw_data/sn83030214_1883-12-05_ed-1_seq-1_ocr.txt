Claims toa large, amount which were held by the

been diplomatically presented to the spanish Gov
eminent. As the action of the colonial authorities
which has gives rise to these claims was admittedly
illegal, full reparation for the injury sustained by

spet t to IfexiOO, The rapid inlliix of our capital ami

already been accomplished, the vast reciprocal ad

Mexican Government, and in the absence uf conven?

enforcement nf the laws against mir vessels and ? iti

HIE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.
WHAT IS SAID OF THE MESSAGE.
OME OF ITS RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH MEW
WITH HEI'CUUCAN FAVOR.
[ST TELFORAI'M TO THS TRIBCNS.]
Washington, Dec. 4.?While it is too early, per
iaps, to hazard a guess as to what actioti either
louse will take ui>on tho suggestions iu the Preai- *
lent's message regarding the National finances, it
s safe to say that on tho whole they are looked
ipon with flavor by a considerable number of Ke
?ublicans in both branches of Congress. Especially
me is this of tho suggestion in regard to the applic?
ation of a portion, at least, of the sur
?1ns revenno to strengthen the Navy
,nd to construct coast defences.
" Why, in our present condition," said a prorui
icnt member of tho Senate Finance Committee to
ay, "the petitest nation might' sass' us with itu
nnity and we would not be able to 'etv*.-' l/ack,
'ho present slate of affairs is disgraceful. The
'resident's recommendation has my heartiest ap
rovnl, and it really ought to receive the serious
nd immediate consideration of Congress." The
pinion expressed by this Senator wits shared by ?
timaerof his colleagues, who all deplore! the in
ffieiency of thc Navy and tho total lack of a proper
ysteni of coast defences.
A reduction of internal revenue taxes seems to find
avor, as far as the Republican Senators aro con
erned, only in the case of tobacco. Many seem to
eof tho opinion that it ought to be abolished
ltogether, while others deprecate so radical and
udden a change. They prefer to HI tlie tax low
red by degrees and not d<>no away at one sweep.
Uegarding tho President's recommendations
or avoiding tho dangers of a contraction of
he currency, whisk would inevitably follow
he retirement of tho three per cents and conscanent
nwilliugness of tho bink, to renew the deposit of
louds to secure the circulation of their cur?
rency, tho opinions seem to bo divided. Thcss
..-mit.irs whoso knowledge of the subject gives
heir views particular weight,incliuo to believe that
i law should bo enacted refsaltag Um tax ou circu
ation and permitting tlie banks to issue notes for aa
mount equal to 90 per cent of tho market value
n.t. ol of, as now, the face valuo of their deposited
minis as recommended by the President aud tho
secretary of the Treasury.
The other plan proposed, that of issuing new bonds
laving many years to run, bearing a low rate of in
erest and exchangeable upon speciii.-.l terms for
hose now outstanding, has many advocates who
ins its adoption upon tho Kron nils of greater sim
ihcify, thouKh they admit that it would entail also
rjrwter exposes.
Tho fee&BJ**. that tho trade dollar "must
;o" has found expression already in a
lill introduced in tho Senate to-day
?y Senator Morrill, which provides for the
eeotaage of tbs direr dollar and all fractional cur
eucy, increasing the weight of the lader to tho
proper standard, and abolishing the nickel S-cent,
ii. ce, substituting therefor one of silver, and tining
iway altogether with the copper cul and 2-cenfc
iie.es, replacing them with nickel coins. Senator
dorrill is also Badarstood to favor the reeommendn
inn.tf the President that trade dollars be recoiled
ry the Treasury aad ?S the mints as bullion at m
miall percentage, to bi* paid by Congress, above the
mirant market price of silver of like tin.-i:. ss.
A further eoiisoli.l.ition of internal revenue eol

WArinisrjTON", Dec 4.?Oovoruor Murray, of
ltah, expresses satisfaction with the President's
?ecoiiinienilatioiis for the abolition of the Terri
:orial Governni.-iit and th* creation of a commission.
lb- says the adoption weald SMSA tho breaking up
>f tho political power of the corporation known as
lie Mormon (.'nurdi and thc wiping out of tho
llegal Government which has exi-*t--d for more
;han thirty years. Tbs recommendations met the
requirements of the case. They will be
received with gratitude by all the Americans,
nit only in Utah, bal in all thal mountain region,
if coarse, the Mormons will receive them with tho
leenest tv.!' ' .
With regard to the probability of favorable ac?
tion in- tn.- Democratic House, Governor Marra*'
laid tut hs had talked with a number of Dsbso
i-ratic Senators and members, \*li.> dui not lind ia
this plan the Constitutional.!.'.j.?< lions which they
*aw iu the Edmonds bill. The proposed action
would breakdown polygamy by asserting the power
?f the United States Uoeerntnent as peates than
lint of the chin. h. Heretofore it had always lu*.n
tin weaker. The proposed legislation was th.-only
effectual couree to be taboo. All legislation short
ol'this simplj strengthened Mormonism as Um Kd
iiiiiiul.s lull liad done.
Of the Morin.tn aiguineiit that Congress had n?>
right to take such act ion, Governor Mun av said
there were at least two precedents for sn. ii action ?
one rn the case of the Territory of Louis:.ma ami
tbe other in tbe 1>in'h.-i of Columbia, where Con?
gress had abolished territorial governments, - Tho
Government," he said, ?? has never laid tts hand ea
tin-throat ot this Institution until now. [hellers
the American people are determined to settle the
question, and the sole uni.-dy is to destroy the po?
litical power .il tin- i lunch."
