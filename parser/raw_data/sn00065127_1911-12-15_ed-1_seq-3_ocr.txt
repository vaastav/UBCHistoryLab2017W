WESTERN CANADA
FARMER SECURES
WORLD'S PRIZE
FOR WHEAT
A
ROSTHERN, SASK., FARMER
THE LUCKY WINNER.
Sir Thomas Shaughnessy of the Ca
nadian Pacific Railway offered $1,000
In gold as a prize for the best 100 lbs.
of wheat, grown, on the American con- I
tinent, to be competed for at the re
cent Land Show in New York. In
making the competition open, the
donor of this handsome prize showed
bis belief in the superiority of Ca
nadian wheat lands, by throwing tho
contest open to farmers of all Amer
lea, both United States and Canada,
The United States railways were by
no means anxious to have tho Ca
nadian railways represented at the
show and a New York paper comment
ing on the results of the competitions
says that they were not to be blamed,
as the Canadians captured the most I
Important prize of the show.
The winner of this big wheat prize
wjs Mr. Seager Wheeler of Rostliern,
Saskatchewan, and its winning has
brought a great deal of credit on the
district. The winning wheat was the
Marquis variety, and received no more
attention from Mr. Wheeler than his
other grain, but he is a very particu
lar farmer. His farm is one of the
cleanest and best kept in the Ros
thern district, and this year he won
first prize in a good farm competition
which included every feature of farm
ing and every part of the farm. Last
•winter Wheeler was a prize winner
at the provincial seed fair in Regina.
Wheeler is a firm believer in sow
ing clean seed of the best quality pro
curable, consequently his grain is
much sought after by the best far
mers for seed purposes.
Wheeler is an Englishman. He is a
pioneer of Rosthern, coming here fif
teen years ago. In the last six years
he has done much experimenting, par
ticularly in wheat varieties. His farm
resembles an experimental farm. A
long driveway, lined on both sides
with trees, leads to a modest house,
the home of Wheeler, a modest, unas
suming man with the appearance of a
student rather than a man engaged in
commercial pursuits.
There are now no free homesteads
to be had in this district, and farm
lands are worth from $20 to $40 per
acre, which a few years ago were se
cured by their present owners, either
as a free gift or purchased at from $5
to $8 per acre.
It is not many miles from Rosthern,
where the farmer lives, who secured
the first prize for wheat last year at
the National Corn Exposition at Co
lumbus and West of Rosthern, about
150 miles, lives Messrs. Hill and Son,
who won the Colorado Silver Trophy,
valued at $1,500, for the best peck of
oats, also awarded at the National
Corn Show at Columbus in 1910.
Not contented with the high honors
obtained in its wheat, Canada again
stepped forward into the show ring,
and carried off the Stillwell trophy
and $1,000 for the best potatoes on
the continent. This time the winner
was a British Columbia man, Mr.
Asahel Smith, the "Potato King," of
that province. The exhibit consisted
of one hundred and one varieties
drawn from all parts of the province
aggregating in weight one and a half
tons.
At the recent Dry Farming Con
gress, held at Colorado Springs, and
at which time it was decided to hold
the next Congress at I^ethbridge, in
1912, the Province of Alberta made a
wonderful showing of grains, grasses
and vegetables.
"At the Congress, Alberta got more
prizes and trophies, ten to one, than
any state of the Union," said Mr.
Hotchldss to the Edmonton Bulletin.
"We brought back all but the build
ing with us, and they offered us that,
saying we might as well take all that
was going. We would have brought
It along, too, if we had had a flat car
to put it on. Alberta captured nearly
50 first prizes, 20 seconds, 3 thirds, 9
•cups, 40 medals, 50 ribbons and 2
sweepstakes. The grand sweepstake
prize, for the best exhibit by state or
province, a magnificent silver cup,
was presented to us with much cere
mony at a. reception to the Canadians
In the Empress hotel. The presenta
tion was made by Prof. Olin, chair
man of the judging committee, and
the cup was received on behalf of the
province by the Hon. Duncan Mar

President Taft Sends in Special Message
Reviewing Our Relations With
Other Countries.
Important General Movement for Broader Arbitration On
Part of Powers is Noted—Mexican War Dis
cussed—Merchant Marine Needed.
Washington, Dec. 7.—Tho flrst of Presi
dent Tat't's promised special messages
was read in congress today. It deals en
tirely with foreign affairs. The message
In part follows:
The relations of the United States with
other countries have continued during: the
past twelve months upon a basis of the
usual good will and friendly Intercourse.
Arbitration.
The year Just passed marks an im
portant general movement on the part of
the powers for broader arbitration. In
the recognition of the manifold benefits
to mankind in the extension of the policy
of the settlement of international dis
putes by arbitration rather than by war.
and In response to a widespread demand
for an advance in that direction on the
part of the people of the United States
and of Great Britain and of France, now
arbitration treaties were negotiated last
spring with Great Britain and France,
the terms of which were designed, as
expressed in the preamble of these treat
ies, to extend the soopf* and obligations of
the policy of arbitration adopted In our
present treaties with those governments.
To pave the way for this treaty with the
United States, Great Britain negotiated
an important modification In its alliance
with Japan and the French government
also expedited the negotiations with sig
nal good will. The new treaties have
been submitted to the senate and are
awaiting its advice and consent to tneir
ratification. All the essentials of these
important treaties have long been known,
and It is my earnest hope that they win
receive prompt and favorable action.
Claim of Alsop & Co. Settled.
I am glad to report that on July last
the American claim of Alsop & Co.
against the government of Chile was
finally disposed of by the decision or his
Britannic majesty George V., to whom,
as amiable compositeur, the matter had
been referred for determination. His
majesty made an award of nearly $1,000,
000 to the claimants, which was promptly
paid by Chile. The settlement of this
controversy has happily eliminated from
the relations between the republic of
Chile and the United States the only
question which for two decades had giv
en the two foreign offices any serious
concern and makes possible the unob
structed development of the relations of
friendship which It has been the aim of
this government in every possible way to
further and cultivate.
Arbitrations.
In further illustration of the practical
and beneficent application of the princi
ple of arbitration and the underlying
broad spirit of conciliation, I am happy
to advert to the part of the United States
in faciliating amicable settlement of dis
putes which menaced the peace between
Panama and Costa Rica and between
Haiti and the Dominican republic.
Since the date of their independence,
Colombia and Costa Rica had been seek
ing a solution of a boundary dispute,
which came as a heritage from Colombia
to the new republic of Pannnia, upon its
beginning life as an independent
na
tion. In January, 1910, at the request of
both governments the agents represent
ing them met in conference at the depart
ment of state and subsequently conclud
ed a protocol submitting this long-pend
ing controversy to the arbitral judgment
of the chief justice of the United States,
who consented to act in this capacity. A
boundary commission, according to the
international agreement, has now been
appointed, and it is expected that the_
ar
guments will shortly proceed and that
this long-standing dispute will be honor
ably and satisfactorily terminated.
Again, a few months ago it appeared
that the Dominican republic and Haiti
I were about to enter upon hostilities be
cause of complications growing out of an
I acrimonious boundary dispute which the
efforts of many years had failed to solve.
The government of the United States, by
a friendly interposition of good offices,
succeeded in prevailing upon the parties
to place their reliance upon some form of
pacific settlement.
Mexico.
The recent political events in Mexico
received attention from this government
because of the exceedingly delicate and
difficult situation created along our south
ern border and the necessity for taking
measures properly to safeguard Ameri
can interests. The government of the
United States, in its desire to secure a
proper observance and enforcement of
the so-called neutrality statutes of the
federal government, issued directions to
tho appropriate officers to exercise a dill
gent and vigilant regard for the require
ments of such rules and laws. Although
a condition of actual armed conflict ex
isted, there was no official recognition of
belligerency involving the technical neu
trality obligations of International law.
On the 6th of March last, in the ab
sence of the secretary of state, I had a
personal interview with Mr. Wilson, the
ambassador of the United States to Mex
ico, in which he reported to me that the
conditions in Mexico were much more
critical than the press dispatches dis
closed that President Diaz was on a vol
cano of popular uprising that the small
outbreaks which had occurred were only
svmptomatic of the whole condition that
a very large per cent, of the people were
in sympathy with the insurrection: that a
eeneral explosion was probable at any
time, in which case he feared that the
440,000 or more American residents in
Mexico might be assailed, and that the
very large American investments might
be injured or destroyed.
After a conference with the secretary
of war and the secretary of the navy, I
thought it wise to assemble an army
division of full strength at San Antonio,
Tex a brigade of three regiments at
Galveston, a brigade of infantry in the
IjOS
Angeles district of southern Call
fornia together with a squadron of bat
tleships and cruisers and transports at
Galveston, and a small squadron of ships
at San Diego. At the same time through
our representative at the City of Mexico
1 expressed to President Diaz the hope
that no apprehensions might result from
unfounded conjectures as to these mili
tary maneuvers, and assured him that
they had no significance which should
cause concern to his government.
I am more than happy to here record
the fact that all apprehensions as to the
effect of the presence of so large a mili
tary force In Texas proved groundless
no disturbances occurred.
From time to time communications
were received from Ambassador Tvilson,
who had returned to Mexico, confirming
the view that the massing of American
troops in the neighborhood had had good
The insurrection continued and resulted
in engagements between the regular
Mexican troops and the insurgents, and
this along the border, so that in several
Instances bullets from the contending
forces struck American citizens engaged
In their lawful occupations on American
soil.
Proper protests were made against
these invasions of American rights to the
Mexican authorities.
The presence of a large military ana
naval force available for prompt action,
near the Mexican border, proved to be
the most fortunate under the somewhat
:rylng conditions presented by this inva
iion of American rights.
The policy and action of this govern
ment were based upon an earnest friend
iness for the Mexican people as a whole,
and it is a matter of gratification to note
that this attitude of strict impartiality as
to all factions in Mexico and of Blncere
Works Splendidly.

friendship for the neighboring nation,
without regard for party allegiance, has
been generally recognized and lias re
sulted in an even closer and more sym
pathetic understanding between the two
republics and a warmer regard one for
the other. Action to suppress violence
and restore tranquility throughout the
Mexican republic was of peculiar inter
est to this government, in that It con
cerned the safeguarding of American life
and property In thut country. On May
25, 1911. President £)iaz resigned. Senor
de la Barra was ch*sen provisional presi
dent. Elections for president and vice
president were thereafter held through
out the republic, and Senor Kranciscn I.

Honduras and Nicaragua Treaties
Proposed.
As to the situation in Central America,
I have taken occasion in the past to em
phasize most strongly the importance that
should be attributed to the consumma
tion of the conventions between the re
publics of Nicaragua and of Honduras
and this country, and I again earnestly
recommend that the necessary advice and
consent of the senate be accorded to
these treaties, which will make It possi
ble for these Central American repub
lics to enter upon an era of genuine eco
nomic national development.
Our relations with th»» Republic of
Panama, peculiarly important, due to mu
tual obligations and the vast interests
created by the canal, have continued in
the usual friendly manner, and we have
been glad to make appropriate expres
sion of our attitude of sympathetic In
terest in the endeavors of our neighbor
1n undertaking the development of the
rich resources of the country.
The Chinese Loans.
The past year has been marked !n our
relations with China by the conclusion
of two important international loans, one
for the construction of the Hukuang rail
ways. the other for the carrying out of
the currency reform to which China was
pledged, by treaties with the United
States. Great Britain and Japan, of
which mention was made In my last an
nual message.
Especially important at the present,
when the ancient Chinese empire is shak
en by civil war Incidental to its awaken
ing to the many IniSuences and activity
of inoderization. are %he co-operative pol
icy of good understanding which has been
fostered by the International projects re

New Japarrese Treaty.
The treaty of commerce and navigation
between the TTnited States and Japan,
signed in 1K94. woulA by a strict inter
pretation of its provisions have terminat
ed on July 17. 1012. Japan's general
treaties with the other powers, however,
terminated in 1911. anfl the Japanese gov
ernment expressed an earnest desire to
conduct the negotiations for a new treaty
with the United States simultaneously
with its negotiations with the other pow
ers. There were a number of important
questions involved in the treaty, includ
ing the immigration of laborers, revision
of the customs tariff and tho right of
Americans to hold real estate in Japan.
The United States consented to waive all
technicalities and to enter at once upon
negotiations for a new treaty on the un
derstanding that there should be a con
tinuance throughout the llfo of the treaty
of the same effective measures for the
restriction of Immigration of laborers to
American territory which had been in
operation with entire satisfaction to both
governments since 1W8. The Japanese
government accepted this basis of nego
tiation. and a new treaty was quickly
concluded, resulting in a highly satisfac
tory settlement of the other questions re
ferred to.
Europe and the Near East.
In Europe and the near east, during the
past twelve-month, there has been at
times considerable political unrest. The
Moroccan question, which for some
months was the cause of great anxiety,
happily appears to have reached a stage
at which it need no longer be regarded
with concern. The Ottoman empire was
occupied for a period by strife in Al
bania and is now at war with Italy. In
Greece and the Balkan countries the
disquieting potentialities of this situation
have been more or less felt. Persia has
been the scene of a long Internal strug
gle. These conditions have been the
cause of uneasiness In European diplo
macy, but thus far without direct politi
cal concern to the United States.
In the war which unhappily exists be
tween Italy and Turkey this government
has no direct political Interest, and I
took occasion at the suitable time to Is
sue a proclamation of neutrality in that
conflict. At the same time all necessary
steps have been taken to safeguard the
personal interests of American citizens
and organizations in so far as affected
by the war.
In spite of the attendant economic un
certainties and detriments to commerce,
the United States has gained markedly in
Its commercial standing with certain of
the nations of the near east.
Coronation of King George V.
The 22d of June of the present year
marked the coronation of his Britannic
majesty. King George V. In honor of
this auspicious occasion I sent a special
embassy to London. The courteous and
cordial welcome extended to this gov
ernment's representatives by his majesty
and the people of Great Britain has fur
ther emphasized the strong bonds of
friendship happily existing between the
two nations.
Settlement of Differences With Great
Britain.
As the result of a determined effort on
the part of both Great Britain and the
United States to settle all of their out
standing differences a number of treat
ies have been entered into between the
two countries In recent years, by which
nearly all of the unsettled questions be
tween them of any importance have been
adjusted by agrement or arrangement:?
made for their settlement by arbitration.
Recognition of Portuguese Republic.
The National Constituent assembly, reg
ularly elccted by the vote of the Portu
guese people, having on June 19 last
unanimously proclaimed a republican gov
ernment, the official recognition of the
government of the United States was
given to the new republic In the after
noon of the same day.
International Conventions and Confer
ences.
The supplementary protocol to The
Hague convention for the establishment
of an International prize court, mentioned
In my last annual message, embodying
stipulations providing for an alternative
procudure which wov:3 remove the con
stitutional objection that part of The

there may be an appeal to the proposed
court from the decisions of national
courts, has received the signature of

International Opium Commission.
In a special message transmitted to tho
congress on the seventh of January. 1911,
in which I concurred in the recommenda
tions made by the secretary of state In
regard to certain needful legislation for
the control of our interstate and foreign
traffic in opium and other menacing
drugs. 1 quoted from my annual mes
sage of December 7, 1909, in which an
nounced that the results of the Interna
tional Opium commission held at Shang
hai in February. 1909. at the Invitation of
the United States, had been laid before
this government: that the report of that
commission showed that China was mak
ing remarkable progress and admirable
efforts toward the eradication of the
opium evil that the Interested govern
ments had not permitted their commer
cial interests to prevent their co-opera
tion In this reform: and. as a result of
collateral investigations of the opium
oiiestion In this country. I reeoinmendcd
that the manufacture, sale and use of
opium in the United States should be
more rigorously controlled bv legislation.
Prior to that time and in continuation
of the policy of this government to se
cure the co-operation of the interested
nation-*, the United States proposed an
International opium conference with full
powers for the purpose of clothing with
the force of international law tlie reso
lutions adopted by the above-mentioned
commission, together with their essen
tial corollories. The other powers con
cerned cordially responded to the pro
posal of this government, nnd. I am glad
to be able to announce, renresentatives
of all the powers assembled in conference
at The Hague on the first of this month
Foreign Trade Relations of the United
States.
In my last annual message I referred
to the tariff negotiations of the depart
ment of state with foreign countries In
connection with the application, by a se
rles of proclamations, of the minimum
tariff of the United States to importa
tions from the several countries, and I
stated that, in Its general operation, sec
tion 2 of the new tariff law had proved
a guaranty of continued commercial
peace, although there were, unfortunate
ly. instances where foreign governments
d^alt arbitrarily with American interests
within their jurisdiction in a manner in
Jurlous and inequitable. During the past
year some instances of discriminatory
treatment have been removed, but I re- I
gret to say that there remain a few
cases of differential treatment adverse to
the commerce of the TTnited States. While
none of these Instances now appears to
amount to undue discrimination in tho
sense of section 2 of the tariff law of
August 5, 1909, they are all exceptions to
that complete degree of equality of tar
iff treatment that the department of
state has consistently sought to obtain
for American commerce abroad.
While the double tariff feature of the
tariff law of 190!) has been amply Justl
fled by the results achieved in removing
former and preventing new, undue dis
criminations against American commerce,
it is believed that the time has come for
tiie amendment of this feature of the law
in such way as to provide a graduated
mentis of meeting varying degrees of
discriminatory treatment of American
commerce in foreign countries as well as
to protect the financial Interests abroad
of American citizens against arbitrary
and injurious treatment on the part of
foreign governments through either leg
islative or administrative measures.
It would seem desirable that the maxi
mum tariff of the United States should
embrace within its purview the free list,
which is not the case at the present time.
In order that It might have reasonable
significance to the governments of those
countries from which the importations
into the United States are confined vlr
ttially to articles on the free list.
The fiscal year ended June 30. 1911.
shows great progress 1n the development
of American trade. It was noteworthy
as marking the highest record of exports
of American products to foreign coun
tries. the valuation being in excess of
$2.wo.cno.000. These exports showed a
gain over the preceding year of more
than SmOOA.OOO.
Crying Need for American Merchant
Marine.
I need hardly reiterate the conviction
that there should speedily be built up an
American merchant marine. This is nec
essarv to assure favorable transporta
tion facilities to our great ocean-borne
commerce as well as to supplement the
navy with an adequate reserve of ships
and men. It would have the economic ad
vantage of keeping at home part of the
vast sums now paid foreign shipping for
carrving American goods. All the great
commercial nations pay heavy subsidies
to their merchant marine, so that it is
obvious that without some wise aid from
the congress the United States must lag
behind in the matter of merchant marine
In its present anomalous position.
Legislation to facilitate the extension
of American banks to foreign countries Is
another matter in which our foreign
trade needs assistance.
With these factors and the continuance
of the foreign-service established ("depart
mental. diplomatic and consular) upon
the high plane where it has been placed
by the recent rearoganizatlon tills gov
ernment would be abreast of the times
in fostering the interests of its foreign
trade, and the rest must be left to the
energy and enterprise of our business
men.
Improvement of the Foreign Service.
The entire foreign-service organization
is being Improved and developed with
especial regard to the requirements of
the commercial interests of the country.
The rapid growth of our foreign trade
makes it of the utmost Importance that
governmental agencies through which
that trade Is to be aided and protected
should possess a high degree of effi
ciency. Not only should the foreign rep
resentatives be maintained upon a gen
erous scale In so far as salaries and es
tablishments are concerned, but the se
lection and advancement of officers
should be definitely and permanently reg
ulated bv law, so that the service shall
not fail to attract men of high character
and ability. The experience of the past
few years with a partial application of
civil service rules to the dipulomatic and
consular service leaves no doubt in my
mind of the wisdom of a wider and more
permanent extension of those principles
to both branches of the foreign service.
I therefore again commend to the fa
vorable action of the congress the enact
ment of a law applying to the diplomatic
and consular service the principles em
bodied in section 17o3 of the Revised Stat
utes of the United States. In the civil
service act of January 16, 1883. and the
executive orders of June 27, 1906, and of I
November 26. 1909. In Its consideration of
this important subject. I desire to recall
to the attention of the congress the very
favorable report made on the Lowden
bill for the improvement of the
foreign service by the foreign
affairs committee of the bouse of repre
sentatives. Available statistics show thut
the strictness with which the merit sys
tem has ben applied to the foreign serv
ice during recent years and the absolute
non-partisan selection of consuls and
diplomatic service secretaries who indeed I
far from being selected with any view
to political consideration have actually
been chosen to a disproportionate extent
from states which would have been un
represented in the foreign service under
the system wlhch it is to be hoped is now
permanently obsolete. Some legislation
for the perpetuation of the present sys
tem of examinations and promotions upon
merit and efficiency would be of
greatest
value to our commercial ana internation
al interests.

"Counsel on the other side are well
aware of the custom of granting clem

other ways."
J. B. McNamara's Confession.
James B. McNamara's brief confes
sion penned by his own hand and
bearing many evidences of a man lit
tle skilled in letters, was made pub
lic. It is as follows.
"1, James B. McNamara, delendant
in the case of the people, having here
tofore pleaded guilty to the crime of
murder, desire to make this state
ment of facts and this is the truth:
"On the night of September 30, 1910,
at 5:45 p. m., I placed in ink alley, a
portion of the Times building, a suit
case containing sixteen sticks of 80
per cent, dynamite, set to explode at
one- o'clock the next morning."
Says He Did Not Intend to Kill.
"It was my intention to injure the
building and scare the owners. I did
not intend to take the life of any one.
I sincerely regret that these unfor
tunate men lost their lives. If the
giving of my life would bring them
back I would gladly give it In fact,
in pleading guilty to murder in the
first degree, I have placed my life In
the hands of the state.
"JAMES B. M'NAMARA."

With the announcement of the pro

formation that the brothers had fur
nished information of great value in
the investigation of an alleged far
reaching dynamiting conspiracy, and
that the plan was to serve them im
mediately after the sentence with
summonses to appear before the fed

that body they are expected to give
testimony which the district attorney
declared they had offered to him.
Tho jury inquisition Is considered
here of vast importance. Its inquiry,
it is believed, will reach the Atlan

an investigation in progress at In

one of the greatest probes along crim

admittedly is for an actual head or
heads to be held responsible for the
long list of dynamite outrages, reach

the search being to learn whether
these all were directed by one man

MISTOOK GIRL FOR RABBIT
Mystery Surrounding Shooting of
Woman Near Mitchell Is
Cleared Up.
Mitchell.—The mystery as to who
shot Miss Lydia Kielhaugh a week
ago while she was in a cornfield has
been cleared up, the guilty party mak
ing a confession when the evidence
led to his door. Miss Koilbaugh is
still in a dangerouB condition and there
is a posslblity that she will lose her
eyesight, as some of the shot penetrat
ed her eyes. Shortly after the shoot
ing men went on the trail of the two
men in the buggy who did the shoot
ing. Some of the evidence pointed to
a man named Henry Lehr, but when
accused of the deed he at flrst denied
It, but closer questioning as to his
whereabouts at the time of the shoot
ing finally brought a confession from
him. I^ehr stated that he had seen
the girl in the cornfield, but after driv
ing in another direction lost sight of
her. Later, spying what he thought
was a rabbit, he took a shot at It, only
to find that it was the girl he had shot.
Lehr stated that he was so frightened
he ran away. l,ehr owns ISO acres of
land near Tripp and he deeded the
same to the physician as a surety that
he would pay all damages of a civil
action.
