THE PRESIDENT'S
E
Recommends Legislation on
New and Important
Subjects.
INCOME -INHERITANCE TAX
He Believes Such Laws Would Curb
Growth or Fortunes to Dan
gerous Proportions.
His Views on Negro Question Asks
for Currency Reform, and 8hipping
Bill Would Make Citizens of Japs
Discussed.
Washington, Dec. I. The notable fea
tures of President Roosevelt's annual
message to congress are his appeal for
the enactment into law of several bills
introduced Into congress last winter and
spring: his views on the negro problem;
the scoring he gives those whom he
terms "preachers of discontent;" the
stand he takes for the control of corpor
ations by the federal government under
the Interstate commerce clause of the
constitution, and his recommendation for
n Inheritance and income tax law.
Many other subjects common to mes
sages of the chief executive are touched
upon, but the ones mentioned are by
far of the greatest importance. He es-
peclally urges the passage of the bill
' prohibiting corporations from contribut
ing to campaign funds, and also that one
which would give the government the
right of appeal In criminal cases. Of
this he savs;
"Another bill which has just past one
house of the congress and which is ur
gently necessary should be enacted Into
law Is that conferring upon the govern
ment the right of appeal in criminal
cases on questions of law. This right
exists in many of the states; It exists in
the District of Columbia by act of the
congress, it Is of course not proposed
that in any case a verdict for the de-
lunuaui un me mencs biiouiu uu wi
aside. Recently In one district where
the government had indicted certain per
sons for conspiracy in connection with
rebates, the court sustained the defend
ant's demurrer; while in another Juris
diction an Indictment for conspiracy to
obtain rebates has been sustained by
the court, convictions obtained under it,
and two defendants sentenced to impris
onment. The two cases referred to may
not be In real conflict with each other.
but it is unfortunate that there should
even be an apparent conflict. At pres
nt there is no way by which the gov
ernment can cause such a conflict, when
It occurs, to be solved by an appeal to
a. higher court; and tire wheels of justice
are blocked without any reat decision of
.the question. I can not too strongly
urge the passage of the bill in question.
A fullure to pass will result In seriously
hampering the government in its effort
to obtain justice, especially against
wealthy individuals or corporations who
o wrong; ana may also prevent tne
government from obtaining justice for
wa&'eworkers who are not themselves
able effectively to contest a case were
the judgment of an Inferior court has
fceen against them. I have specifically
in view a recent decision by a district
Judge leaving railway employees with
out remedy for violation of a certain so
called labor statute. It seems an absurd
ity to permit a single district judge,
against what may be the Judgment of
the Immense majority of his colleagues
on the bench, to declare a law solemnly
enacted by the congress to be "uncon
stitutional," and then to deny to the
government the right to have the su
preme court definitely decide the ques
tion.';
Injunctions. "
On th subject of the abolition of In
junctions In labor disputes, he says:
in Illy tUBl IIICB.aBD & BUeBDBLDU 11119 eil-
actment of a law in connection with the
issuance of injunctions, attention hav
ing been sharply drawn to the matter
by the demand that the right of apply
ing injunctions In labor cases should be
wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful
whether a law abolishing altogether the
use of injunctions in such cases would
stand the test of the courts; in which
case of course the legislation would be
Ineffective. Moreover, I believe it would
be wrong altogether to prohibit the use
of injunctions. It Is criminal to permit
sympathy with criminals to weaken our
hands in upholding the law; and If men
seek to destroy life or property by mob
violence there should be no impairment
of the power of the courts to deal with
them in the moBt summary and effective
-way possible. But so far as possible the
abuse of the power should be provided
against by some such law as I advocated
last year.
The Negro Problem.
The negro problem is givon considera
ble attention, after calling attention to
the fact that no section of the country
Is free from faults, and that no section
has occasion to Jeer at the shortcomings
of any other section, he turns to the sub
ject of lynchings, and especially as ap
plied to the negro of the south. He says
the greatest existing cause for mob law
Is the perpetration by the blacks of the
crime of rape, a crime which he terms
ven worse than murder. He quotes the
admonitions to the white people spoken
by Gov. Candler, of Georgia, some years
ago, and by Gov. Jelks, of Alabama, re
cently, and then says:
"Every colored man should realize
that the worst enemy of his race is the
negro criminal, and above all the ne
gro criminal whd commits the dread
ful crime of rape; and It should be felt
as In the highest degree an offense
against tho whole country, and against
the colored race In particular, for a
colored man to fall to help the officers
of the law in hunting down with all
possible earnestness and zeal every
such Infamous offender. Moreover, In
my Judgment, the crime of rape should
'always be punished with death, as is
the case with murder; assault with In
tent to commit rape should be made a
-capital crime, at least in the discretion
of the court; and provision should be
made by which the punishment may
follow immediately upon the heels of
the offense; while the trial should be
so conducted that the victim need not
be wantonly shamed while giving tes
timony, and that the least possible
publicity shall be given to the details.
The members of the white race on
the other hand should understand that
every lynching represents by Just so
much a loosening of the bands of civ
ilization: that the spirit of lynching
Inevitably throws Into prominence In
the community all the foul and evil
- creatures who dwell therein. No man
can take part In the torture of a hu
man being without having his own
moral nature permanently lowered.
Every lynching means Just so much
moral deterioration In all the children
who have any knowledge of it, and
Iherefore Just so much additional
trouble for the next generation of
Americans. ,
"Let Justice be both sure and swift;

.;-. Capital and Labor.
On the subject of capital and labor
the president takes the agitators of class
hatred to task and says "to preacfe
hatred to the rich man, as such, . . .
to seek to mislead and Inflame to mad
ness honest men whose lives are hard
and who have not the kind of mental
training which, will permit them to ap
preciate the danger In the doctrines
preached is to commit a crime against
the body politic and to be false to every
Worthy principle and tradition of Amer
ican national life." Continuing on tills
fcuhlect he says:
"The plain people who think the
mechanics, farmers, merchants, work
ers with head or hand, the men to
-whom American traditions are dear.
i who love their country and try to act
decently by their neighbors, owe It to
themselves to remember that the most
-damaging mow mat can De given pop
- ular government Is to elect an un
r worthy and sinister agitator on a
platform of violence and hypocrisy.
whenever such an Issue is ' raised In
-this country nothing can be gained by
. filnchinar from it, lor in sucn case asm
oorecv Ir Itself on trial, popular self'
- government under republican forms la
Itself on trial. The triumph of the
mob Is lust as evil a thing as the trl-.
' ' vmph of tho plutocracy, and to have
scaped one danger avails nothing
whatever If we sucuumb to the other.
In the end the honest man, whether rich
or poor, who earns his own living and
tries to deal justly by his fellows, has
as much to tear from the Insincere
and unworthy demagog, promising
! xnueh and performing nothing, or else
A UAL MESSAG
performing nothing; but evil whs
would set on the mob to plunder the
rich, as from the crafty corruDtionUt.
who. for his own ends, would permit J
tne common people to De exploited by
the very wealthy. If we ever let this
government fail Into the hands of men
of either ef these two classes, we shall
show ourselves false to America's past.
Moreover, the demagog and corrup
tionist often work hand fn hand. There
are at this moment wealthy reaction
aries of such obtuse morality that they
regard the publlo servant who prose
cutes them when they violate the law,
or who seeks to maun them bear their
proper ehare of the publlo burdens, as
being even more objectionable than
the violent agitator who hounds on
the. mob to pluder the rich. There Is
nothing to ch-yose between such a re
actionary and such an .agitator; funda
mentally tney are an ice in tneir eeinsn
disregard of the rights of others; and
It Is natural that they should join In
opposition to any movement of which
the aim is fearlessly to do exact and
even Justice to all."
Railroad Employees Hours.
He asks for the passing of the bill lim
iting the number of hours of
employment of railroad employes, and
classes the measure as a very moderate
one. He says the aim of all should be
to steadily reduce the number of houra
of labor, with as a goal the general In
troduction of an eight-hour day, but In
sists that on the Isthmus of Panama the
conditions are so different from what
they are here that the Introduction of an
eight-hour day on the canal would be
absurd, and continues, "just about as ab
surd as It Is, so far as the Isthmus is
concerned, where white labor cannot be
employed, to bother as to whether the
work Is done by alien black men or alien
yellow men."
He urges the enactment of a drastic
child labor law for the District of Co
lumbia and the territories, and a federal
investigation of the subject of child and
female labor throughout the country.
He reviews the work of .the commission
appointed to investigate labor conditions
In the coal fields of Pennsylvania In 1902,
and refers to the wish of the commission
"that the state and federal governments
should provide the machinery for what
may be called the compulsory Investiga
tion of controversies between employers
and employes when they arise.1'
"In this age of great corporate and la
bor combinations, neither employers nor
employees should be left completely at
the mercy of the stronger party to a dis
pute, regardless of the righteousness of
their respective claims. The proposed
measure would be in the line of securing
recognition of the fact that In many
strikes the public has Itself an Interest
which cannot wisely be disregarded; an
Interest not merely of general conven
ience, for the question of a just and
proper public policy must also be con
sidered. In all legislation of this kind
it Ib well to advance cautiously, testing
each step by the actual results; the step
proposed can surely be safely taken, for
the decisions of the commission would
not bind the parties In legal fashion, and
yet would give a cnance ior puouc opin
ion to exert its full force for the right."
Control of Corporations.
X considerable portion of the message
Is devoted to the subject of federal con
trol of corporations in what he refers to
the passage at the last session of the
rate, meat Inspection and food laws, and
says that all of these have already justi
fied their enactment, but recommends
the amendment of the meat inspection
law so as to put dates on the labels of
meat products, and also to place the
cost of Inspection on the packers rather
than on the government. Continuing on
this subject of the control of corporations
by the federal government ne Bays:
"It cannot too often be repeated that ex
nArlfnrp has onnHllsfvolv shown the ttn
possibility of securing by the actions of
nearly nair a nunurea amereni
legislatures anything but Ineffective
chaos In the way of dealing with tho
great corporations which do not operate
exclusively within the limits of any one
state. In some method, whether by a
national license law or In other fashion,
we must exercise, and that at an early
date, .a far more complete control than
at present over these great corpora
tions a control that will among other
things prevent .the evils of excessive
overcapitalization, and that will compel
the disclosures by each big corporation
of ItB stockholders and of its properties
and business, whether owned directly or
thru subsidiary or affiliated corporations.
This will tend to put a Btop to the secur
ing nf innrrilnatn nroflts bv favored
individuals at the expense whether of
the general public, the stockholders, or
the wageworkers. Our effort should be
not sn much tr nrevnnt consolidation as
such, but so to supervise and control it
as to see that It results In no harm to
the people. The reactionary or ultracon-
servative anoiosists ior tne misuse ui
wealth assail the effort to secure Buch
control as a sten toward socialism. As a
mailer or. tact it is tnese reactionaries
and ultraconservatlves who are them
selves most potent In Increasing socialis
tic feeling. One of the most efficient
methods of averting the consequences of
a dAneftrnus airttation. wnicn is BU per
cent, wrong, is to remedy the 20 per cent.
ot evil as to wnicn tne agnaiiou is won
founded. The best way to avert the very
undesirable move for the governmental
ownership of railways is to secure by
the government on behalf of the people
as a whole such adequate control and
regulation of the great interstate com
mon carriers as will do away with the
evils which give rise to the agitation
against them. So the proper antldot6
in the dansrerous and wicked agitation
against the men of wealth as such is to
secure by proper legislation and execu
tive action the abolition of the grave
abuses which actually do obtain In con
nection with the business use of wealth
under our present system or rather no
system of failure to exercise any ade
quate control at all. Some persons speak
as if the exercise of such governmental
rntrni would An awav with the freedom
of individual Initiative and dwarf Indi
vidual effort. This Is not a fact. It
would be a veritable calamity to fall to
fiut a premium upon Individual initiative,
ndlvidual capacity and effort; upon the
energy, character and foresight which
It is so important to encourage In the
individual. But as a matter of fact the
deadening and degrading effect of pure
socialism, and especially of Its extreme
form communism, and the destruction of
Individual character which they would
bring about, are In part achieved by the
wholly unregulated competition which
results In a single Individual or corpor
ation rising at the expense of all others
until his or Its rise effectually checks all
competition and reduces former competi
tors to a position ot utter inferiority and
subordination.
Inheritance and Income Tax.
It was expected that the president
would refer In some way to his .belief
In the necessity for the curbing ot enor
mous fortunes, and he has done so by
recommending legislation for both In
come and an inheritance tax. He be
lieves the government should Impose a
graduated Inheritance t r, and, If possi
ble, a graduated income tax. He says:
"I am well aware that such a subject
as thle needs long and careful study In
order that the people may become famil
iar with what Is proposed to be done,
may clearly see the necessity of proceed
ing with wisdom and self-restraint, and
may make up their minds just how far
they are willing to go in the matter;
while only trained legislators can work
out the project In necessary detail. But
I feel that In the near future our nation
al legislators should enact a law provid
ing f a graduated Inheritance tax by
which a steadily Increasing rate of duty
should be put upon all moneys or other
Valuables coming by gift, bequest, or
devise to any Individual or corporation.
It may be well to make the tax heavy
in proportion as the Individual benefited
IB remote of kin. In any event, In my
Judgment the pro rata of the tax should
increase very heavily with the Increase
of the amount left to any one Individual
after a certain point has been reached.
It la most desirable to encourage thrift
and ambition, and a potent source of
thrift and ambition Is the desire on the
J art of the breadwinner to leave his chll
ron well oft. This object can be attained
by making the tax very small on moder
ate amounts ot property left; because
the prime object enould be to put a con
stantly increasing burden -on the inher
itance ot those swollen fortunes which
It Is certainly of no benefit to this coun
try to perpetuate.
There c&o be no question of the eth
ical propriety of the government thus de
termining the conditions upon which any
gift or inheritance should be received.
Exactly how far the Inheritance tax
would, as no Incident, have the effect ot
limiting the transmission by devise or
flirt of the enormous fortunes In question
t Is not necessary at present to discuss.
It Is wise that progress in this direction
should be gradual. At first a permanent
national Inheritance tax, while It might
be more substantial than any such tax
has hitherto been, need not approximate,
either In amount or In the extent of the
Increase by graduation, to what such a
tax should ultimately be.
Agricultural Interests. ''
He appeals for every enoouragement
that the congress can give to the agri
cultural Interests of the country. He
points to the good, that is being done by
he various forms of grange organisa
tions, and says:
"Several factors must cooperate In the
Imnrovement of the farmer's condition.
He must have the chance to be educated
In the widest possible sense... the sense
which keeps ever In view the intimate
relationship between the theory of edu
cation and the facts of lite. In all
education we should widen our alma. It
Is a good thing to produce a certain num
ber ot trained scholars iwd students;
but the education superintended ty the
state must seek rather to produce a bun
dred good citizens than merely one
seaoiar, ana it must De turnea now ana
then from the class book to the study
of "the great book of nature Itself. Thl
Is especially true of the farmer, as ha
been pointed out again and again by all
observers most competent to pass prac
tical juagment on tne proDiems oi our
country life. All students now realize
that education must seek to train the
executive powers of young people end to
confer more real significance upon the
pnrase ' dignity or moor, ana to pre
oare the dudIIs so that In addition to
each develatlng In the highest degree
nis inaiviauai capacity ior wors, tney
may together help create a right publlo
opinion, and show -4n many ways social
and cooperative spirit. Organization has
become necessary In the business world:
and It has accomplished much for good
In the world of labor. It Is no less neces
sary for farmers. Such a movement as
the grange movement Is good In Itself
and is capable of a well-nigh Infinite f ur-
tner extension for good so long as it is
kept to its own legitimate business. The
benefits to be derived by the association
of farmers for mutual advantage are
partly economlo and partly sociological.
Marriage and Divorce, i
mum nf hrinrln ohnnt n.llnnd
Regulation of marriage and divorce he
suggests a constitutional amenament, ana
says It Is not safe to leave these ques
tions to be dealt with by the various
states. Continuing on this subject ha
ays:
Wh
hen home ties are loosened: when
men and women cease to regard a
worthy family life, with all Its duties
fully performed, and all Its responsi
bilities lived up to, as the life best
worth living; then evil days for the
commonwealth are at hand. There are
reglons'in our land, and classes of our
population, where the birth rate has
sunk below the death rate. Surely it
should need no demonstration to show
that wilful sterility is, from the
standpoint of the nation, from me
standpoint of the human race, the one
sin for which the penalty Is national
death, race death; a sin for which
there Is no atonement; a sin which Is
the more dreadful exactly In propor
tion as the men and women guilty
thereof are in other respectB, In char
acter, and bodily and mental powers,
those whom for the sake of the state
it would be well to see the fathers
and mothers of many healthy children,
well brought up In homes made happy
by their presence. No man, no woman,
can shirk the primary duties of life,
whether for love of ease and pleasure,
or for any other cause, and .retain his
or her self-respect.
The president asks for the enactment
Into law of a shipping bill that will place
American Interests on the seas on a par
with those of other countries, and urges
especially that something be done that
will establish direct steamship commu
nication with South American ports.
; Currency Reform.
Amendments to the present currency
laws are asked for, and after showing
that present laws are inadequate because
of the wide fluctuation of Interest
charges, he says:
"The mere statement of these facts
shows that our present system Is seri
ously defective. There Is need of a
change. Unfortunately, however, many
of the proposed changes must he ruled
from consideration because they are
complicated, are not easy of compre
hension, and tend to disturb existing
rights and Interests. We must also
rule out any plan which would ma
terially Impair the value of the United
States two per cent, bonds now pledged
to secure circulation, the issue of
which was made under conditions pe
culiarly creditable to the treasury. I
do not press any special plan. Various
plans have recently been proposed by J
expert cummiiiwes oi uimiterH. Among
the plans which are possibly feasible
and which certainly should receive
your consideration is that repeatedly
brought to your attention by the pres
ent secretary , of the treasury, the es
sential features of which have been
approved by many prominent bankers
and business men. According to this
plan national banks should be ' per
mitted to issue a specified proportion
ot their capital in notes of a given
kind, the Issue to be taxed at so high
a rate as to drive the notes back when
not wanted in legitimate trade. Thla
plan would not permit the issue of
currency to give banks additional
profits, but to meet the emergency pre
sented by times of stringency. -
He again asks for free trade with this
country for the Philippines and in the
same connection reviews the work done
by this country In the islands, and says
"If we have erred In the Philippines it
has been In proceeding too rapidly In
the direction ot granting a large meas
ure of self-government.''
Naturalization of Japs.
President Roosevelt scores San Fran
cisco and other Pacific coast cities for
their ' treatment of the Japanese, and
makes the following recommendations:
"I recommend to the congress that
an act be passed specifically provdlng for
the naturalization of Japanese who come
here intending to become American cit
izens. One of the great embarrassments
attending the performance of our In
ternational obligations is the fact that
the statutes of the United States gov
ernment are entirely Inadequate. They
fall to give to the national government
sufficiently ample power, through United
States courts and by the use of the
army and navy, to protect aliens In the
rights secured to them under solemn
treaties which are the law of the land.
I therefore earnestly recommend that
the criminal and civil statutes of the
United States be so amended and added
to as to enable the president, acting for
the United States government, which Is
responsible in our International rela
tions, to enforce the rights of aliens un
der treaties, jsven as tne law now la
something can be done by the federal
government toward this end, and In the
matter now before me affecting the Jap
anese, everything that It Is in my power
to do will be done, and all ot the forces,
military and civil, of the United States
which I may lawfully employ will be
so employed. There should, however, be
no particle of doubt aa to the power ot
the national government completely to
perform and enforce Its own obligations
to other nations. The mob of a single
city may at any time perform actB of
lawless violence against some class of
foreigners which would plunge us into
war. The city by Itself would be power
less to make defense against the for
eign power thus assaulted, and If Inde
pendent of this government It would
never venture to perform or permit the
performance of the acts complained of.
The entire power and the whole duty to
protect the offending city or the offend
ing community lies in the hands of the
United States government. It Is un
thinkable that we should continue a pol
icy unaer wnicn a given locality may De
allowed to commit a crime against a
friendly nation, and the United States
government limited, not to preventing
the commission of the crime, but, in the
last resort, to defending the people who
have committed It against the conse
quences oi tneir own wrongdoing."
Amerlcun citizenship should be con
ferred on tne citizens of rorto Rico.
The harbor of San Juan In Porto Rico
should be dredged an, Improved. The
expenses of the federal court of Porto
Rico should be met from the federal
treasury. The administration of the af
fairs of Porto Rico, together with those
of the Philippines, Hawaii and our other
insular possessions, Bhould all be direct
ed under one executive department; by
preference the department of state or the
department or war. i
Cuban Intervention. "
The rebellion In Cuba and the inci
dents leading up to the establishment of
ine provisional government is reviewed,
and the president says:
"When the election has been held and
the new government IriauirurfLtari In
peaceful and orderly fashion of the provi
sional government will come to an end.
I take this opportunity of expressing
upon behalf of the American people,
with all possible solemnity, our most
earnest hope that the people of Cuba
will realize the Imperative need of pre
serving Justice and keeping order In the
Island. The United States wishes noth
ing of Cuba except that It shall prosper
morally and materially, and wishes noth
ing of the Cubans save that they shall
be able to preserve order among them
selves and therefore to preserve their
Independence. If tho elections become a
farce; and It the Insurrectionary habit
becomes confirmed In the Island, It Is ab
solutely out of the- question that the
Island Bhould continue independent; and
the United States, which has assumed
the sporsorshlp before the clvllleed world
for Cuba's career aa a nation, would
again have to Intervene and to see that
the government was managed In such
orderly fashion as to aecure the safety
of life and property. The path to be
trodden by thoBe who exercise self-government
Is always hard, and we should
have every charity and patience with the
Cubans as they tread this difficult parth.
I have the utmost sympathy with; and
regard for, them; but I most earnestly
adjure them solemnly to weigh their re
sponsibilities and to see that when their
new government is started It shall run
smoothly, and 'with freedom from fla
grant denial of right on the one hand,
and from Insurrectionary disturbances on
the other."
On the subject of the Panama oanal ha
Fromlses a special message In the near

POINT TO CONSIDER
REPUBLICANS CANNOT EVADE RJJT.
, ,v I 8PONSIB1I.ITY, 1
Whether the Tariff or Railroad Rebate
. Evil la the Mother of Trusts, the
Party in Power Has Dons Much
to Foster Them . i
President Havemeyer of the sugary
trust stated to the industrial commis
sion in 1898 that the tariff Is the
mother of trusts, but now comes, the
belated opinion of Attorney General
Moody that "not the tariff but the
railroad rebate is the mother ot
trusts." Whichever of these impor
tant Republican opinions is the right
one is not of much consequence, for
all impartial investigators are agreed
that the tariff and railroad rebates
are both closely related to trust plun
dering and either may well be the
mother and the other the father of
these predatory corporations. But the
chief thing is to remember that the
Republican party has been standing
pat while the trust fostering was in
cubating and now the trust infants
have grown to the stature of giants
the Republican party is still continu
ing to prevent legislation' that will
take from the trusts the monopoly
they enjoy through tariff protection.
There is no escape for the Repub
lican leaders, front President to state
legislator, from the fact that since
coming into power in 1897 and enact
ing the Dlngley tariff, that the trust
era has accompanied that trust-fostering
law. Nor can it bo denied that
since the tariff was so greatly in
creased in 1897 It has been accom
panied by a similar advance in the
price of nearly all commodities,' until
now the cost of living, according to
Dun's and Bradstreet's index figures,
is close upon BO per cent, higher than
before the Dlngley law was passed.
As the Republican leaders have
taken all the credit for any advantage
to business from the trust boom and
have even attempted to appropriate
the blessing from favorable seasons
and resulting good crops, they must in
return be held responsible for the
enormous inereased cost of living and
the great loss to those whose Incomes
have not kept pace with their in
creased outgo. The Republican lead
ers must also explain to the farmers
why the price of wheat and other ag
ricultural products has fallen under
the trust fostering tariff, which they
have assured the farmers was to pro
tect them as. well as the trusts. As
long as poor crops abroad apparently
kept up this Republican deception, by
making a demand for our surplus
wheat and other farm products and
their price naturally was advanced, the
Republican theory, that the tariff ben
efited the farmer, appeared to the un
thinking to have good grounds for be
ing really responsible for prosperity.
But that Republican idol has been
shattered by the reduced demand for
wheat and other farm products and
the fall In the price . t
It is therefore incumbent on the Re
publican leaders, who have been go
ing up and' down the land claiming
that prosperity is due to the tariff,sto
explain this breach in the tariff walls
that has allowed the low priced farm
products to get Into the tariff fort
ress alongside of the high priced
trust products. They must also ex
plain why the trusts are to continue
to have a monopoly under the high
tariff law and the farmers shall still
be forced' to sell at prices fixed In the
free trade markets of the world in
competition with the surplus of other
countries that have like products to
dispose of.
A revision of the tariff Is obviously
demanded so that the trusts shall
lose their enormous protection and the
consumers farmers and other people
alike will be protected from paying
the high prices that the trusts are
protected by the tariff in imposing on
all the American people.
Tariff Reform Coming.
The latest Republican con verts
from the standpat doctrine'before elec

that tariff, reform must come, and
think that President Roosevelt has
made a great mistake in surrendering
to the trusts and protected monopo

purely a matter of politics with both
those two worthies and the president

the ardent standpatters seem ready to
change their tariff coats as policy dic
tates. There is no doubt that a very
large number of the Republican vot

that shelter and protect the trusts, but
their wishes for the present, at least,
have been nullified by the allience and
adroit maneuvering of the president

The Pure Food Law. -. 4
The Republicans claim the credit for
the pure food law, but the Republican
congress made no appropriation for
carrying the law into effott. The ma
jority of the Republican members of
congress have little sympathy with
the law and tried before they passed
it to weaken it at every point. When
It comes to voting the appropriation of
$1,000,000 which Secretary Wilson says
Is necessary to carry out the provisions
of the law, we shall see how much, in
fluence has been exerted by such op
ponents as the patent medicine people
and other interests that are interfered
with., The law goes into effect on Jan.
1, but until provision is made for its
enforcement, it will 'be a dead letter.
The growth of corporations still con

ending with October ; nearly one bil

vested in corporations than tor the

present term being $1,824,039,000, and
this vast mm is confined to those cor
porations with $1,000,000 or mora cap

faster than the Republicans can un
hyse them.
MURDER
By Edith
(Copyright, IMS, by
I was a youth Qf 17 when my grand
father died, hence my recollections of
him are quite distinct and mature.
I was orphaned In my Infancy and
from my earliest recollection - my
grandfather had made me his con
stant companion. He was an itiner
ant preacher of western England his
circuit calling him from walled Ohes-
ter on the -west to the hovels of the
charcoal burners in mid-England;
and during the years of his itinerancy
I followed him in the pursuance of
his duties through sun and rain and
winter gale. -
I repeat this in order to explain
Just how I regarded my grandfather
in the light of a certain hereditament
he left to me, his diary, but which
he expressly forbade me opening
until I had passed my twenty-fifth
birthday.
There were many things I witnessed
and head In my boyhood for which
I could find no explanation until I

entry in the diary, is as follows:,

terrible mind disorder, or whether 1
am-gifted with perceptions beyond
the usual ken of man. .
It was in the first years of my
study of the occult, long before thou
hadst come to gladden thy grand
sire's heart, that I was Journeying to
Blore Health. When night came down
fate led me to the door of a desolate
inn slowly dropping to ruin In the
perpetual ishadow ot a grove of oak.
The aged host greeted me' most
cordially, for at his Inn guests were
not frequent and therefore the more'
welcome. In the parlor back of the
denuded ar I found his old wife and
his daughter, the only other persons
about the place, moving silently here
and there preparing the evening meal.
The daughter was young and tall and
straight and strong and her hands
were coarsened with outdoor Work
for, it appeared, she was now the
burden-bearer of the family. ;
After the supper was cleared away,
the aged parents entertained me with
reminiscences of a past glory, of
when the Inn was new and the great
tide of travel used to pass its door.
Then in saddened tones they told of
how the opening of a new thorough'
fare had diverted custom to other hos
telrles. So when the daughter was
married to a well-to-do young farmer
they closed the inn, perforce, ' and
went and made their home with her.
But one ill-fated day the newly
wedded husband rode away to a
neighboring' market town and never
returned.
After due time the farm ajd tene
ments passed into the possession of
the next heir-at-law, a cousin of the
husband; and the old couple with
their dowerless daughter returned to
the deserted inn, now racked and
wrecked with Btorm and long neglect.
"Thou canst Bee the gables of the
farm over yon above the trees," said
the mother, "and we might be living
there now 'mid comfort and plenty if
Lisbeth would only hearken to us and
wed with Garver Hallard, the cousin
who succeeded to the estate.
Then Lisbeth, lifting her sorrow
laden eyes to a portrait of her hus
band on the wall, said: "Mother,
thou need'st not grieve for the rich
living at the farm beyond Whitsun
tide. That day I promise to give my
hand to Garver Hallard an' he still de
sires it."
Then a gloomy silence leu like a
funeral pall over us, and we sat about
the fire absorbed In our own thoughts
until there came the sound of a quick
step up the pathway and an im
perative knock at the door, and Gar
ver Hallard entered. He was a dark,
hard-featured, , harsh-spoken man
whom any tender, young woman might
well have shunned.
I could not understand it then but
I intuitively felt that he was a man
with a guilty conscience, And in the
light, of the recent narration, I fell
to comparing Ub features with those
of the picture hanging above his head.
As my gaze wandered from one to
the other there came to me a sense of
a presence in the room, a conviction I
could neither define nor evade; and
while I strove to analyze , critically
this impression a strange metamor
phosis seemed to come over my senses
and I felt myself drifting, as it werei
into a state of double consciousness,
Still with that sense of a divided
ego, with the voices about me echoing
vaguely through my brain, I thought
myself riding along5 a country road,
sunken and scarred deep With old
cart ruts, a road I had never traveled
before. Under the influence of this
unseen force, I appeared to come to
where the crumbling! shell ot an an
cient oak spanned the path. I reached
Into the hollow trunk and drew forth
a spade corroded with rust, and roll
ing the log away I began to dig into
the damp, soft, earth. - In my trance I
continued to throw the dirt to the
right and to the left until from out the
brown loam appeared. the face In the
picture. , Then the feverish vision
broke, and I emerged as from an hyp
notic spell to find the old couple dis
cussing eagerly with Garver Hallard
concerning the wedding ' settlement,

rode away in the morning I galloped

spade which, I did not doubt but I
should find concealed, therein; and
after I drew it forth I paused to
verify each stamp which time and the
elements bad set upon blade and
handle, as I had remarked them
erstwhile in my vision. As I rolled
the log back from its hollowed bed I
espied among the crumbling bits of
bark the remnant ot a glove, with the
initial H embroidered upon the wrist
I hastened back to Oswestry and
raised a hue and cry- that murder had
been committed. ,
Accompanied ' by a sheriff and
posse and a motley crowd of ex
cited citizens, I returned to the spot
my absence of explanation . un
noticed in the frenzy of the hour.
With the exhuming of the body an
unusual phenomenon was discovered
to have taken place. The waters tit
the little ' brook close by had per
meated through the soil to the corpse
of the murdered man and, acting upon
the tissues,' bad preserved it with life'
like features. Both I, and those with
me who had known him in life, recog'
ntzed In him Ltsbeth's husband who
had so mysteriously disappeared four
years before. A stab In the back that
penetrated to the heart told how he
bad met his death.
When I went on to the inn to pre
pare the widow and her parents for
the bringing home of the husband so
long dead, I found Garver Hallard,
and a few guests who had been In
vited to the wedding, impatiently
awaiting me. lilsbeth had been
tricked out in bridal white, but her
expression was that of deepest de
spair. .: . -i-, ' '
"In view of the news I bring, the
marriage would better be 'postponed

might understand. "Lisbeth, I bring
thee sad tidings of thy last husband."
Then I said that the body was
found and Hallard ' staggered - back
against the bar as though I had dealt
him a blow., There came a great fear
Into his narrow eyes, his swarthy fea
tures grew livid; and after I had told
my tale he asked with quivering Hps

the glove in mind, did look him level

" When I began taking Dr. Williams'

spells of vomiting, could Dot eat,
in fact, did not dare to, I had such dis
tress after eating. My stomach was filled
with gas which caused me awful agony.
Che backache I suffered was at times
almost unbearable and the least exertion
made my heart beat so fast that I could
hardly breathe. Cut the worst ot all was
the splitting neuralgia headache which '
never left me for seven weeks. About this
time I had had several numb spells. My '
limbs would be cold aud without any
feeling aud tne most deathly sensations
would come w er me.
"NothiiiR had helped me nntill began
taking Dr. Williams' Fink Pills, in fact,
I had grown worse every day. After I
had taken the pills a short time I could
see that they were benefiting me and
one moping I awoke entirely free from
pain. 'The distress after eatiug disap

A BRIDGE OF MAHOGANY.
Valuable Wood Used In Mexican Struo
ture tor pedestrians ana Teams. ,
As mahogany is among the mosl
costly woods in the world, It may b
inferred that this tropical material
is not very extensively employed In
the construction of buildings, etc. A
bridge constructed of solid mahogany
is certainly a rarity, a curiosity.
There is one, claimed to be the only
one in the world, built of that mate
rial. This structure is located in the
department of Palenque, state of Chi
apas, republic of Mexico. This dis
trict lies in the extreme southwestern
part of Mexico, near the boundary line
of Guatemala.
The mahogany bridge Is construct
ed entirely of that valuable wood,
except some iron braces and nails thai
are necessary. The bridge, spans the
Rio Michol and Ms total length, in
cluding approaches, exceeds 150 feet,
while the width is 15' feet. It Is used
by both teams and pedestrians and,
though somewhat rude and primitive
in construction, it is very substantial,
None of the timbers of the flooring
were sawed, for In that region there
are no sawmills, but were hewn and
split. ,
In that section of old Mexico there
are several very large rubber planta
tions, and mahogany trees are quite
common. In clearing away the trop
ical forests for setting out the young
rubber trees the mahogany growths
are also cut down and removed, Ai
this wood Is quite abundant, some oi
it was used in building the bridge.

NEW YEAR'S CALL8.

Twenty-five years ago the custom ot

The custom, of calling on one's
