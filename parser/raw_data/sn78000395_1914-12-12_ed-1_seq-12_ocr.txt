Director Bickell Urges Support
of Anti-Tuberculosis War
During Holday Season.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11.—None of
the proceeds from the sal© of Red
Cross Christmas seals which are be­
ing sold widely throughout the United
States for the benefit of the anti­
tuberculosis movement will be used
for war relief purposes, according
to a statement issued today by Ernest
P. Bicknell, national director of the
American Red Cross.
Mr. Bipknell says: "The American
Red Cross is deeply appreciative of
the sympathetic interest which has
inspired the suggestion from various
parts of the United States, that a cer­
tain percentage of the Red Cross
seal sales fund, which has been used
for the last six years exclusively for
the prevention of tuberculosis in the
United States, be expended this year
to aid the European war sufferers.
While the Red Cross is trying very
hard to raise a large war relief fund
and is anxious to secure contribu­
tions that will increase this fund, we
do not feel justified in adopting any
policy which will tend to cripple the
tuberculosis work in this country,
which is dependent for its support
to so large an extent on the sale of
Red Cross Christmas seals. The an­
nouncement that a percentage of the
Red Cross seal money would go to
our war relief fund might possibly
increase the sale, but in our opinion,
the final results would show a dis­
tinct loss in that part of the pro­
ceeds going for tuberculosis work.
"At the present time there are
over 1,000 anti-tuberculosis societies
distributed over nearly state in the
Union, and even in Vera Cruz, the
Panama canal zone and far off Ha­
waii, which are dependent almost en­
tirely upon the receipts from the
Red Cross seal sale for their work

Minimum. Wage Discussed by
Former Minnesota State
Labor Commissioner.
The annual banquet of the Union
Labor Pavilion association was given
by the Board of Directors last Fri­
day evening- at Kalamazoo hall. There
was a full attendance of inerribers, in­
cluding a number of invited guests.
After a wholesome spread the annual
report of the board was read. It
showed a balance of $1,200 in the
treasury.
Speeches were made toy Henry Pere
ault. Building Inspector Samuel X.
Kielley, M. J. Harney, Peter Marana
daw. J. H. Powers, William Murnian,
W. K. McEwen, and several others. Mr.
McEwen made the principal speech of
the evening. He complimented the
board of directors upon the success
they bad achieved during the year, and
said they were showing what might be
done in other lines of business through
co-operation. He then went into a
lengthy discussion of the minimum
wage law and spoke in part as follows:
"In view of the United States Su­
preme court's decision in the "Wo­
man's Hours of Labor" case, it is im­
possible to understand how any honest
court could have declared the Minne­
sota Mininum Wage law inconstitu
tional. Judge Catlin held that when
the states fixes fhe minimum wage of
a woman it impairs her right of con­
tract, and hence is in violation of the
constitution of the United States. The
employes have taken refuge behind
this provision of the Federal consti­
tution in all legislation affecting the
hours of laibor, the safety and the
wages to be paid."
"In an argument before the Senate
committee in behalf of the minimum
wage law in which the constitution­
ality of the measure, in the face of the
opinion of a half dozen lawyers re­
presenting- the employing interests, the
judiciary committee of the Senate ac­
cented labor's view of the question and
recommended the passage of the bill.
Statistics were offered from the Com­
missioner of Labor's department show­
ing the effect of the insufficient wage
upon the health and morals of the wo­
men workers."
"If the Supreme court of Minnesota
agrees with Judge Catlin it will sound
tire death knell of social legislation
in this state for many years to come
and this is just the thing the employ­
ing interests of the twin cities expect
to do. They had to use the country
merchants and manufacturers to pull
their chestnuts out of the fire and
every bit of legislation is affected
thereby. When the eight-hour bill for
women was presented they deluged
the state with letters, appealing to
country hotels and country merchants
to write to the members of the legis­
lature against the measure, magnify­
ing how much the bill might hurt
these country people but saying not a
word about country girls, who the

traps.

Conferences have been held between

fer of practically one-half a cent an
hour increase.
This offer was rejected almost
unanimously by the employes the

was agreed that the matter should
be placed in the hands of an arbi­

Annual Message to Congress

For National Defense.
CHAMPIONS OF PEACE AND
CONCORD, SAYS WILSON
America's Opportunity Is Now to
Exemplify the Counsels
of Peace.
WASHINGTON Dec. 11.—In his an­
nual message to congress Tuesday,
President Wilson answered the criti
cisms of those who are eagerly.striv­
ing for greater military- expenditures.
"Let there be no misconception," he
said, "'the country has been misinform­
ed. We have not been negligent of
national defense. We are not unmind­
ful of the great responsibility resting
upon us. We shall learn and profit, by
the lesson of every experience and
every new circumstance and what is
needed will be adequately done."
Senators and representatives heard
the president reading his address in
person from the clerk's desk, outline
the administration legislative program
and voice a fervent hope that the
United States might be instrumental in
bringing peace to Europe. The legis­
lative program includes passages of the
conservation bills, the bill for ultimate
independence of the Phillippines, rat­
ification of the London convention for
safety at sea, a government owned
merchant marine, charting the perilous
waters of the Alaskan coast and meas­
ures for economy in all branches of the
government.
National Defense,
But the portion of the president's
address which commanded intense in­
terest was that in which he discussed
the subject of national defense.
"It

At Peace With World.
We are at peace with all the world.
No one who speaks counsel based on
fact or drawn from a just and candid
Interpretation of realities can say that
there is reason to fear that from any
quarter our independence or the integ­
rity of our territory is threatened.
Dread of the power of any other nation
•we are incapable of. We are -not jeal­
ous of rivalry in the fields of com­
merce or of any other peaceful achieve­
ment. We. mean to live our own lives
as we will but we mean also to let
live. We are, indeed, a true friend to
all the nations of the world, because
we threaten none, covet the possessions
of none, desire the overthrow of none.
Our friendship c^n be accepted and is
accepted without reservation, because
it Is offered in a spirit and' for a pur­
pose which no one need ever question
or suspect. Therein lies Our greatness.
We are the champions, of peace and of
concord. And we should be. very jeal­
ous of this distinction which we have
sought to earn. Just now: we' should
be particularly jealous of it, because
it is our dearest present hope that this
character and reputation may present­
ly, in God's providence, bring us an*
opportunity such as has seldom been
vouchsafed any nation, the opportunity
to counsel and obtain peace in the
world and reconciliation and a "heal­
ing settlement of many a matter that
has cooled and interrupted the friend­
ship of nations. This is the time above
all others when we should wish and
resolve to keep our strength by self
possession, our influence by preserv­
ing our ancient principles of action.
No Large Army.

and settled policy with regard to mili­
tary establishments. We never "have
had, and while we retain -our present
principles and ideals we never shall
have, a large standing army. If asked,
are you ready to defend yourselves?
we reply, most assuredly,, to the ut­
most and yet we shall riot turn Am­
erica into a military camp. We wOl
not ask our young men to spent-the
best years of their lives making sol­
diers of themselves. There is another

fire we shall be. careful to make our

tain and adequate Indeed*

"But I turn away from the subject.
It is not new. There is no new need
to discuss.it. We shall' not alter, our
attitude toward it because some
amongst us are nervous and excited,
We shall easily and sensibly agree
upon a policy of defense. The ques­
tion has not changed its aspects be­
cause the times are not normal. Our
policy will not be for an occasion. It
will be conceived as a permanent and
settled thing, which we will. pursue
at all seasons, without haste ana after
a fashion perfectly consistent with, the
peace of the-world, the abiding ^friend­
ship of states, and the unhampered1
freedom of all ^vith whom we deal. Let
there be no misconception. The coun­
try had been misinformed. We have
not been negligent of national defense.
We are not unmindful of the great re­
sponsibility resting upon us. We sh&U
learn and profit by. the lesson of every
experience and every new circum-s
stance and what is needed will be
adequately done."
Champions of Peace*
To peace in Europe the president,
referred briefly: "We are the cham
pions of peace and of concord," he
said. "And we should be very jealous
of this distinction which we have
sought to earn. Just now we should
be particularly jealous of it because
it is our dearest present hope that this
character and reputation may pres­
ently, in God's providence, bring us
an' opportunity such as has seldom
been vouchsafed any nation,: the op­
portunity to counsel and obtain peace
in the world and reconciliation and a
healing settlement of many a 'blatter

friendship of nations. This is the time
above all others when we should wish
and. resolve, to keep. o,ur strength by
self-possession, our influence by pre­
serving ouraricient principles .of ac­

that
we are not prepared for war," said the
president. 'What is meant by being
prepared? Is it meant that we are riot
ready upon brief notice to put a na­
tion in the field, a nation of men train­
ed to arms? Of course we are not
ready to do that and we shall never

"We have always found means to do
that, and shall nd them whenever it is

Attorney Decides on Disposition

COLUMBUS, O., Dec. 11.—Attorney
General Hogan decided on Nov. 28

county, by Burns detectives just be­

came out in 1911, and which was

Vining, son of the late Speaker
Samuel J. Vining, would be to give
it to the destitute eastern Ohio min­
ers.
Before Speaker Vining's death,
which accured at his home in Celina
several weeks ago, he discussed with
General Hogan what disposition
should be made of the money. Nye
turned the money over to Mr. Vining,
advising it had been given him by a
detective who tried to bribe him. The
