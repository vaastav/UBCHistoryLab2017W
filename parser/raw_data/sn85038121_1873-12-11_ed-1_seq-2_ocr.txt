THE CUBAN DIFFICULTY.
A Change of Front—Spanish
Demands Refused—Trouble
Anticipated.
We stated at some length last week
that the Cuban difficulties had al! been
settled by the acceptance of the three
demands made by our government
upon Spain, vii: 1. The surrender of
tha Virtrinius. 2. The restoration of
' D
the crew. -3. A suitable indemnity lo
the families of those slain. A protocol
to this effect was made between Admi
ral Polo and Secretary Fish. The
acceptance of the propositions, i
"seemed, ' would preclude all possibili
ties of war, but the Spanish govern
jnenl being powerless to enforce its' or
ders in Cuba, has since asked to have
the protocol modified so that the Vir-

neutral power until its character could
"be ascertained, and that she could not
be surrendered in the harbor of Havana
,.f i1,a 1a mg. To
VII lul , -
uemand the Cabinet, on Saturday
after a full discussion, refused to ac
.cede or modify the protocol, and the
opinion was expressed that the agree
ment between the United States and
Spain must be carried out, even if the
American fleet is obliged to take the
Virginius in Cuban waters. Congress
will in all probability sustain this
position taken by the Executive and
Cabinet.
It is elated that the Spanish govern
ment, when it becomes satisfied that
the Republic can not enforce its official
orders upon its Cuban subjects, w
make official admission of this fact;
that a revolution exists on the island.
and countenance our government in
the seizure of the Virginius under the
euns of Moro Castle. Should our
government consent to a modification
of the protocol which it will proba
bly not and consent to the delivery
of the vessel into other hands for ad
judication, the affair may yet be ami
cably adjusted. The prevailing opin
ion is that we have made already too
many concessions to wholly evade the
stigmas of contempt and cowardice,
and the government by public voice be
compelled to stand by the existing pro
tocol.
Work in the navy yards is being
rapidly pushed, and laboring forces

meats in great numbers, and the situa
tion snows that our government is
getting ready for the worst A week
will probably make large developments
P. S. The latesl dispatches from
Havana say: "The feeling in the city
continues to improve. Opposition to
the delivery of the Virginius is de
creasing. Prominent Republicans and
many Conservatives favor the delivery
of the steamer, and adviee the cessa
tion of hostilities." It is now asserted
that the Virginius will be delivered to
one of our naval vessels within the
next ten days at a Cuban port in open
day; and the surviving passengers and
crew will be transferred to a United
States ship at Santiago de Cuba in an
equally open manner. If this is done
it is supposed war will be avoided.
9Newepaper readers are now be
ing bored by a great amount of sillv,
sympathetic stuff about how "Boss
Tweed" sleeps; the food he eats; bis
cell and its furniture; bow he looks,
acts, tc , in his new home in the peni
tentiary. This man has stolen his
millions from the people is undoubt
edly the greatest thief of the age and
why this sympathy? If he had been
a common thief stolen $'10 from some
citizen his penitentiary life would
Lave received no attention. But being
a big thief these writers must gnsb
over him. Tweed deserves all the
punishment he will get, and we care
no more about his prison life than
about others of lower grade.

ZT Senator Boreman, of W. Va ,
has introduced a bill in Congress, to
complete a water highway from James
River to the Ohio, at the mouth of the
Kanawha. It directs the Secretary of
War to lay out, construct, enlarge and
improve a water way from tide water
on the James River at Richmond, Va ,

Kanawha River, in West Virginia, by
way of the James River and Kanawha
Canal, the James, Jackson, Greenbrier,
Neat and Kanawha Rivers, by canal,

gation not less than eeienty feet wide
and t-even feet deep, with locks not less
than one hundred and twenty feet long
and twenty feet wide, and with a ca
pacity for vessels of at least S80 tons
burden.
The States of Virginia and West
Virginia are to convey to the United
States their interest in the properly or
franchises of any corporation having a
claim to the continuous line of water
communication projected and in part
completed by the State of Virginia,
and the cost of the work lo be defrayed
by the issuance and sale of United
States ten-fifty four and a half per
cent bonds lo the amiunt of $8.O0O,4piave

tions to Congress:

equivalent or compensation, and of
ascertaining the names 01 persons
entitled to receive compensation for
the same making the computations
on the baeis indicated by the I nou
nal of Arbitration at Geneva.
CITIZENSHIP.
I invite Congress to mark out and
define when and how expatriation
can be accomplished; to regnlate by
law the condition of American wo
men marrying foreigners; to fix the
status of children .horn in a foreign
country of American parents, resid
ing more or less permanently abroad;
and to fix rules for determining such
other kindred points as may seem
best to Congress.
ELECTION OF PRESIDENT AND VICEPREPREISDANT.
PRESIDENT.
For a constitutional amendment
providing for the election of Presi
dent and Vice President I make two
suggestions for your consideration:
First, To authorize the Executive to
approve of so much of any measure
passing the two Houses of Congress,
as his judgment may dictate, with
out approving the whole, the disap
proved portion or portions to be
subjected to the same rules as now,
to wit: To be referred buck to the
Ilonss in which the measure or
measures originated, and if passed
by a two-thirds vote of the two
Houses, then to become a law with
out the approval of the President.
I would add tn this a provision thai
there should be no legislation by Con
gress during the last twenty four
hours of its filling, except npon
vetoes, in order lo give the Execu
tive an opportunity to examine and
approve or disapprove understand
ingly.
Second, to provide by amendment
that when an extra session of Con
gress is ordered by Executive pro
clamation, legislation during: the
continuance of such extra session,
shall be confined to such subjects as
the Executive may bring before it
from time to time, in writing.
THE PANIC.
. permaneiriJjjroapplrllggj!lBn'j
My own judgment is that however
much individuals may have suffered,
one long step has been taken toward
specie payments; that we can never
that a specie basis can not be reached
and maintained until our exports)
exclusive of gold to pay our imports,
interest due abroad, and other specie
obligations, are so heavy as to leave
an appreciable accumulation of the
precious metals in the country from
the products or our mines
THE CURRENCY.
During the last four years the cur
rency has been contracted directly
by the withdrawal of three per cent.
certificates, compound interest notes.
and seven-thirty bonds outstanding
on the 4th of March, 1869, all of
which took the place of legal tenders
in the bank reserves, to the extent of
863,000,000. During the same pe
riod there has been a much larger
comparative contraction of the cur
rency; the population of the country
has largely increased; more than
twenty-five thousand milea of rail
roads have been built, requiring the
active use or caoital to operate them
millions of acres of land have been
opened to cultivation, requiring
capital to move the products; manu
factories have been multiplied
beyond all precedent in the same
period of time, requiring capital
weekly for the payment of wages
and for the purchase of material
and probably the largest of all com-
parative contraction arises from the
organizing of free labor in the South.
Now every laborer there receives his
wages, and for want of saving banks,
the greater part of such wages is
carried in the pocket, or hoarded till
required for use. These suggestions
are thrown out for your considers
tion, without any recommendation
that they shall be adopted literally,
but hoping that the best method may
he arrived at to secure such an elas
ticity of the currency as will keep
employed an the industries or the
country, and prevent such an infla
tion as will put off indefinitely the
resumpti n of specie payments, an
object lo be devoutly wished for by
an, and by none more earnestly than
the class or people most directly in
terested those who earn their bread
by the sweat of their brow. The
decision of Congress on this subject
win have the hearty support of the
Executive.
EXPLORING EXPEDITION.
I suggest a small appropriation be
made, accompanied with authority
the Secretary of the Navy to fit
out a naval vessel to ascend the
Amazon River to the mouth of the
Madeirsj thence to explore that river
and its tributaries into Bolivia, and
report to Congress at its next
session, or as soon as practicably, thp
accessibility of the country by water,
resources, and the population so
reached. Such an exploration will
cost bat little; it can do no harm,
and may result iu establishing a trade
value to both nations.

BANKRUPT ACT.
I recommend that so much of the!
act approved March 2, 1867, entitled
"An act to establish a uniform ays
tern of bankruptcy throughout the
United States," as provides for Jn
roluntary bankruptcy on agconnf; of
suspension of payments be re

CUBA AHD TQX EPAKISB QOBSTIOtf.
The Spanish Government has re
cognized the justice of oar demand,
and has arranged for the immediate
deliver? of the- vessel, and for the
surrender of the survivors of.'the
passengers ana crew, ana tor a snute
to the flag, and far proceedings
looking to the punishment of fcose
who may be proved to have been
guilty of illegal acts of violent to
ward citizens of the United States,
and also toward indemnifying liose
who may be shown to be entrtld to
indemnity. The embargoing1 of
American estates in Cuba; eroelty
to American citizens detecteH ii no
act of hostility to the Spanish Gov
ernment; the murdering of prisoners
taken with arms in their hands; and,
finally, the capture npon the high
seas of a vessel sailing ondei the
United States flag and bearing a
United States registry, has crimi
nated in an outburst of indignation
that has seemed for a time to tlea
ten war. Pending negotiation be
tween the United States andj the
Government of Spain on the sufiject
of the capture, I have authorized
the Secretary of the Navy to puf our
navy on war footing to the exteit, at
least, of the entire annual apprdria
tion for that branch of the seance,
trusting to Congress and the ptblio
opinion of the American peopl'to
justify my action.

Joyce Gets Rather Officious.
Editor. Journal: It seems that a
certain Individual who left the Joi'hsal
last spring, for a summer tour, returned
some time ago, and not being content to
settle down quietly and attend to her
own affairs, began looking about her for
something on which to exercise her
brilliant argumentative powers, and
finding a back number of the Jovkxal
containing one of my articles, she made
desperate onset, which began by a
whole paragraph of twaddle on phre
nology; next by a gross insinuation she
tried to misinterpret my meaning, and
place a wrong construction on said arti
cle; then turns about, takes up my sub
ject, just where I left off, and finished
up the discourse by oiiring out her pent
up eloquence in a sort of whining sequel
to my remarks. Jit other words she
closed after me for which service I am
willing to have the hat passed around
for her especial lteneflt on our next oc
casion. Xow, I am a natural phrenolo
gist, can read her bumps without a very
close examination, and have long since
observed that she is afflicted with one or
two bumps which stand out more prom
inently than the bump of obtuseness.
Her bump of conceit is large, while her
bump of intrusiveness is likely to get
her into many a muss. I am not dis
posed to waste many words with one
whose writings breathe forth such a
strong under current of malice, yet If,
she still persists in argument, and noth
ing else will do, why just let her get a
better hold, and I shall be with her.

A. Davis, of Cora, has sold over twelve
hundred dollars worth of boots and

Guess the people have not got the panic
bad, about there.
T. lticuanDS, (formerly landlord in
Centerville,) is just finishing up a coal

one of that kind of "fellers." Be ready

Messrs. Matiikws and P.iTi.KKof Vin

Pork is coming into market quite free
