President Harding's Message.
President Hardinc's message to
Congress is tilled to the brim with
[Issues and questions that come home
to all the American people. It radiates
the clear vision and common
* sense which have so strikingly
marked his policies and programs I
from the beginning of his term of
office as Chief Executive. It will
command the attention which is the
due of big, practical purpose based
upon the penetrating conclusion that
"there never again will be the old
order of things."
Within the reasonable compass of
an editorial discussion it would not
be possible to go into all the matters
the President so fully covers with
v the clarity of a singularly straight
thinker and the skill of a master of j
plain expression. A few examples of j
what he proposes to and urges upon j
Congress will serve to show, however,
the grasp this man has of the ,
problems that face alike the country \
. and the world. For the rest it will
/ richly pay every thinking American
to read closely this message which
The New York Herald does not hes- j
Itate to say is the most telling and j
the most cogent of the many very
line state papers he has issued from
the White House.
What sound mind, for instance, can
challenge the President's conclusion
that if the Government is to regulate
both wages and rates, railroad wage
fixing should be lodged with the
same authority as railroad rate making?
Since the Interstate Commerce
Commission alone has the power to
add to or subtract from the incomes
of the roads the Interstate Commerce
Commission alone should be charged
with the responsibility of determining
how much of that income thus
determined by itself should be absorbed
by labor charges, which are
the great bulk of railroad operating
expenses.
Again there may be room for argu
ment as to whether men should ever
he compelled to work against their
will, even in the case of public service
corporations; but if they are to
, have their wages set for them by a
Government body and if there is to
be a power of enforcement of its
orders by a Government body that
authority should be exercised by the
body charged with making both the
traffic rates and th*, vage rates.
In the same way President Harping
gets at the very essence of railway
service, railw- * economics und
at the same time reasonable transportation
rates when he asks Congress
to do something concrete toward
putting the roads into a few
great systems, pooling their freight
cars and otherwise obtaining the
largest possible results on the lines
of modern business methods on a
grand scale. There is no bigger
v ork ahead of the American nation
j than that.
The President also goes to the
heart of the agricultural problem,
pointing out that better rural banking
credits and banking facilities are
essential for the farmer and for the
country. But that will not be
enough. The business of the farmer
and the welfare of the consumer of
food products depend very largely
on the means of sending tho farm
products to market speedily, safely
and cheaply. And hII this is comprehended
in the President's program
for the railway zoning system,
the joining of tbo rate making power
and of the wage making power in
cne authority and the coordination
of water and highway with rail
'P movements.
The President's demand for a correction
of child labor abuses by legal
changes that will stand the test of
V the courts is not merely the Impulse
,J' of his heart, always specially warm
where children are concerned: It Is
1] the reflection of the American sentl-1
tui ment that small rh 'dren should not ;
be subjected to tnrd?n?'me labor and
the American demand that the means
shall be found to prevent such things. )
This Is a problem the American peo|.
pie are deferar. ned to have worked
wj oat
As for President Haapivc'a deelarajftf
tion that the dry lows should be
obey HI m long ae they are t be laws
of the country, good citizens will
agree with him that this is a proposition
which cannot be contradicted in
logic, or in morals. The question will i
remain, however, and it is a great
nationwide question, whether the
iaw will be respected nevertheless,
where public opinion is against it,
and whether it can be enforced.
The Cure for Europe.
All Europe is economically sick.
All Europe is so closely knit together,
the various States so interdependent,
each on all, that Europe is as a
human entity.
With one part diseased the whole
body is affected, and Gtrmany, with
the demoralization of her currency,
with an indemnity hanging over her
that benumbs the brain and paralyzes
all purpose to dig out; and with internal
dissensions that threaten the
overthrow of government and the
overthrow of law and order and
threaten anarchy itself; with poverty
and depression and discouragement
and misery among the poor, and with
the gaunt Nfigure of national bankruptcy
stalking through the land?
Germany is sick unto death. And
with Germany in this condition there
can be no return to health for the
rest of Europe.
The thing for Europe to do is to
get Germany well so that it will have
a chance to get well itself.
The .allied Premiers are meeting
to-day in London to discuss reparations
in preparation for the proposed
Brussels conference. If the discussion
hinges 011 the question of the
last cent that can be hammered out
of Germany, as has been the attitude
of the Allies from first to last, the
work of the Premiers will be a flat
failure.
If, on the other hand, the Premiers
should have the big view of the
situation In all its seriousness and
; should take the stand that Europe
[ must be brought back to health at
any sacrifice of indemnities or anyi
thine else, thev will forestall interna
j tional disaster and initiate a move
j that will put Europe on its feet
l again.
The very heart of the question that
confronts the allied Premiers is this:
How much can the Allies permit Germany
to pay in indemnities and be
certain that the amount is not so
large that it will stand in the way
of her rapid restoration to economic
health and to national health? For
Germany's restoration to health
would mean the restoration to economic
health of all the rest of
Europe. This
is the big question in the big
sense that should dominate at the
meeting of the Premiers, for it is the
one way out for groping, distressed
Europe.
There is nothing in lashing a
people to do the thing that-is not
humanly possible for them to do.
It is the cure we want, not the
i lash. The lash has well nigh
i wrecked all Europe.
From Socialism to Tammany.
In 1920 the total number of ballots
cast for Cannon,. Quinn and
Malone, candidates for Governor of
New York State respectively of the
Socialist, the Socialist Labor and the
Farmer-Labor parties, was 334,727.
This year Casnipy, candidate of
j the Socialist, Farmer-Labor and
' Socialist Farm-Labor parties, and
Crowley, candidate of the Socialist!
' Labor party, polled together 112,435. |
In each election these candidates j
represent with more or less enthusi- i
asm and accuracy what loud voiced
agitators call the social revolution
| in certain of the aspects of that
! nebulous but noisy revolt. The
I shrinkage of their vote from 1920 to
1922?a shrinkage in the FarmerLabor
vote which eliminates that
party from the list of legally recog- I
nized political parties?is commonly j
ascribed to the absorption of their
votes into the Democratic Tammany
ranks on account of the radical naI
ture of the platform on which At,
Smith was elected Governor.
A sobering thought, even an
alarming thought, is presented in
this explanation of the diminution of
the radical vote. Does socialism,
radicalism, social revolt lead eventually
to Tammany Hall? It never
| has before.
The Plain People'* Money.
In all the rest of the world there
is nothing comparable to the financial
power of the rank and file of
the American people. In 5,000 banking
institutions of the country there
is now going on a distribution of
$190,000,000 of so-called Christmas
I club funds. This money has been
! put by for months in small amounts j
! of,r?vl WJMklr in pnvrr itla honnaitaru1
I? ~ I
Christmas shopping.
But that !a not all there is to the
national fund especially put by for
Christmas?put by for the Christmas
spending of the general public.
In thousands of other hanks depositors
have been keeping Christmas
Items in reserve In their regular deposit
accounts. Furthermore, men,
women and children the country over
have been tucking away In safe places
both loose change and small bills for
the festivities and Joys of the season. .
The total of all these Christmas
club funds, formal and Informal,!
could scarcely count less than a j
quarter of a billion of dollars; It j
j might run nearer to half ? billion
[ of dollars.
Besides those Christmas funds there
is coming due on New Year's Day
f625.000.000 of war savings stamps
which In the great bulk belong to
the wage earners of the country. And
that is not all the investment they j
have in the securities of the coun- i
try. They have great quantities of 11
the lower denominations of Liberty|l
bonds and notd#. Nobody knows j|
t .
THE NE
what these total in dollars, so far as
concerns the wage earners and other
small investors, but no responsible
estimate has ever placed the amount
low in the hundreds of millions; it
is very high in the hundreds of
millions.
And even that is not all the saved
wealth owned and at the command
of the rank and file of the American
people. In the savings banks of the
United States for 1920 there were
11,437,556 accounts with deposits of
more than six and a half billions of
dollars. Incomplete figures for the
current period Indicate that these
savings banks accounts now total approximately
eight billions of dollars.
With the deposits that small savers
carry in the savings departments of
trust companies and other banks the
grand total of the American people's
savings accounts Is estimated to run
now between ten and eleven billions
of dollars.
And there Is more yet. It is in
the form of the small shareholdings
which employees as well as general
investors have acquired in great corporations
like the Pennsylvania
Railroad, the United States Steel
Corporation and the American Telephone
and Telegraph Company.
Whether this is tens of millions or
hundreds of millions of dollars there
is no sure way of telling now, but as
there are hundreds of thousands of
such small investors on the stock
books of merely a few of the great
companies it is easy to see that with
an average of only ten shares of
such stock, 1,000,000 small shareholders
would mean 10,000,000 shares
thus distributed, which at an average
value of $75 a share would be threeouarters
of a billion of dollars.
In all those small savings and investments,
therefore, there cannot be
less than thirteen billions of dollars;
there may easily be more than fifteen
billions of dollars?and in value
form that is almost ready to cash
in, for the man who needs or wants
to cash in, at sight.
The Free State Strikes Back.
The news from Ireland is bitter
stuff for those who had hoped that
the Free State would be able to begin
its labors in an atmosphere of peace.
With an overwhelming majority of
the people of the south in favor of
the new Government it was believed
that the insurgents might be led,
either by the conciliatory policy of
the State or the lack of support in
the country, to lay down their arms.
But the insurgents ceased to be
soldiers only to become assassins.
Wa a Via 11 nnf oav tViat iliov Ucaaccl.
Dated Collins, for he was ready for
battle when ambushed and it was
give and take until the great young
leader fell. But the killing of Sean
H-u.es on Thursday was assassination.
That it was the beginning of a
concerted movement to kill, one by
one, the members of the Chamber of
Deputies is suggested by the Irish
army authorities.
The Free State's answer to the
killing of Hales is grim indeed. It
might have executed Rory O'Connor
and Liam Melloweh for their revolt
against the Government, but it has
gone further than that in announcing
that these insurgent leaders were
banged in reprisal for the shooting
of Hai.es. Reprisal is usually to be
condemned as something which does
not accomplish the result desired. It
la a rnlllne hall that eathers blood
and hatred as It goes.
But for all that, what answer will
appeal to the deluded followers of
Dk Valeba except death and terror?
They have exulted over the killing
of Cow.ins, who, with Griffith, won
for Ireland more freedom than
O'Connell or Parnklt, ever dreamed
the island could have. They have
kept the country in fear of their
raids. They have sworn to fight to
tha last for their cause?a cause
which could mean nothing hut chaos
and the ultimate return of British
control. They have rejected the Free
State's offer of peace with amnesty.
They have scorned the advice and
the pleas of their people and their
clergy.
Ireland must and will find herself.
She must cope with a sly, ruthless
and fanatical enemy in her own way.
And if she sometimes strikes very
hard, as she struck yesterday, it
must be remembered that the punishing
hand is tho hand that was
scorned only a few weekR ago when
it was extended in friendship and
mercy.
Road Building on a Big Scale.
I
In the fiscal year 1922 there were
completed in the United States 10,000
miles of highways built with
Federal aid, and more than that
mileage In the construction of which
tho Government gave no assistance.
These figures, prepared by the Bureau
<11 i IIIMK Xll/mo Ul IIIC <W II I ICU DMinn
Department of Agriculture, together
with the program for future construction,
give ground for the hope
that In a few years the United States
will have an adequate system of modern
highways.
The work completed between July,
1921, and June, 1922, Inclusive was
sufficient in mileage to provide a
highway twice around the borders of
the country, with something to spare.
The total length of the highways
built in that period nearly equals the
circumference of the earth at the
equator.
Most of the roads built in the fiscal
year were finished before the new
federal aid act became effective, on
November 9, 1921. Few projects
were in preparation by the States as
the old ones approached completion.
The act, however, gave a great Impetus
to plans for State construction,
and by Junff, 1922, projects embracing
nearly 40,000 miles were called I
'or. There are at present under con
W YORK HERALD,
struction 14,500 miles of highways
that are estimated as 56 per cent,
complete.
Nothing is closer to the foundations
of a civilized State than are roads.
Find a backward section of the world,
one where education and the standards
of living are on a low level, bad
roads or no roads worthy of the
name will mark it.
France Makes a Turf Record.
The record of the largest winnings
by a racehorse has passed from England
to France as the result of the
success this year of the line fouryear-old
Ksar, owned by Mme. Ksar
Blanc, widow of Edmond Blanc, who
was a turfman as well as proprietor
of the Casino at Monte Carlo.
M. Blanc was as successful at racing
as he was at gaming. His purchase

for the Duke of Westminster was a
master stroke on the part of M.
Blanc, for from Flying Fox came
Ajar, Adam, Jardy and Val d'Or,
four first class racehorses. They
were all of the same period and
started M. Blanc on a career of turf
prosperity which it was estimated
brought a clear return of (1.000,000
through the earnings of Flying Fox
and his progeny. M. Blanc paid
about (187,500 for Flying Fox.
Mme. Blanc continued her husband's
racing stable, and the good
fortune which enabled him to estab;
lish a record for winnings in a single
j year?horses in his colors won (326,l

name remembered wherever racing
is followed, she has some distance to
go before surpassing the achievements
of her husband, who won the
Grand Prix de Paris no fewer than
seven times and on one occasion, in
1903, saw his horses run first, second
and third for the richest racing prize
in the world.
Maine Suspects Her Ice.
The news from Maine about ice is
discouraging. The greatest or ice
producing States has put a ban on
ice as a direct cooler of beverages.
Hotels and other public eating places
are forbidden to serve drinks with
ice in them. The legislators fear
that bacteria might harm the drinker.
Shades of the Maine ancients who
feared neither bears nor bacteria,
what is the Dirigo State coming to!
Nature was particularly kind to
Maine in the matter of ice. She endowed
the State with seven thousand
lakes and streams and just the
right temperature to turn them solid
at the top every winter. When less
fortunate Commonwealths were putting
in refrigerating machines Maine
was getting her ice where ice grows.
She shipped it. too, to cool the fevered
throat of New York.
Now, says the news from Augusta,
"ice cannot come in contact with
any fluid that is to be drunk." The
old custom of putting a barrel of
mature cider out of doors in January
and then drawing off from the
center the stult that would not freeze
?is that illegal now? Does anybody
think that the fluid which flowed
from the center of the barrel could
harbor bacteria? Applejack in the
old days could kill a germ moro
quickly than It slew a farmhand.
Maine has pained the rest of the
country by such a law. It Is a confession
that she harbors bacteria.
And everybody outside thought that
between the salt sea and the pine
forests no wicked bug could live in
Maine. /
New York is soon to have a. specimen
of the baluchistherlum which was

Siberia has yielded an- j
other prehistoric specimen to Eng-1
land In the skeleton of another mam- ]
moth with tusks six feet long. The
British mammoth Is nearly as Impressive
as the American specimen
except for the polysyllabic name by
which our own private monster is to
be called.

Traffic Delays.
They, Not Honors Paid to Conspicnous
American, Cause Complaint.
To The New York Herald: In yes- i
terda'y morning's paper you printed a |
letter fronj one Kdward A. LeRoy, who |
Js complaining of the tleup of traffic on
Fifth avenue last Monday while the
funeral ceremonies of the late General
I Roe were being cbnducted.
This complaint is so poorly lodged and
shows such lack of public spirit?in fact
la not even accurate?that I feel Mr.
LeRoy should be answered.
A man who has served in the army of
this country as long and faithfully as
did General Roe Is certainly entitled to
all the honor and pomp which It is possible
for a military funeral to give. One
who objects to being Inconvenienced
thereby is not displaying either an ordl
nary human thought or a patriotic one.
Another thing about this letter is that
about the taxi fare being nearly doubled.
The detour might have been the cause
If Mr. Lertoy had made a very short
ride, but the wuiting cost him nothing,
as there is not a charge made to my
knowledge while waiting for traffic.
Most likely he had the wrong kind of
cab; one that costs about twice as
much as the green flag.

No pomplalnt was made about the
honors Justly paid to General Roe.
Dissatisfaction was based on the
traffic regulations adopted.
Marriage After Death.
The Question of the Mennin&r of the
New Testament's Words.
To The New York Herald: My attention
lias been called to a letter of
Stuart L. Tyson correcting a report of
a sermon of his at ?t. Mark s-ln-theBouwerle.
Your former quotation of
his words, "Christ made it clear that
His ideal of marriage wa* one man for
one womatj for eternity," Is much more
satisfactory than his correction "until
death broke the bond of matrimony."
The writer supports his argument that
the New Testament does not teach the
conception that marriage lasts after
death by noting that the New Testament
nowhere makes such specific statement.
Neither doi-* it say marriage Is
for this world alone and docs not last
after death. It should he taken for
granted rather that it does so survive
if genuine, and the burden of proof to
the contrary is upon the denlers; "If
it were not so I would have told you."
But Dr. Tyson suggests that the Lord
Christ was clear in His statement, "in
the resurrection they neither marry nor
aro given in mM-rlagc, but arc us tlio
angels of God in heaven." He does not
say that they do not remain married if
really married in this world. He intimates
that the kind of external, convenient
marrtages which are arranged
in this world have no place in the next
world.
But people "are as the angels," and
the angels who are male and female are
married if their spiritual Interests are
hound together, one man and one
woman, and they love each other exclusively.
That Is marriage.
Then too, there is tlio natural assumption
of a man and wife who do
really love each other that they will
'continue that relation eternally. It is
the normal assumption and It would take
strong urgumont to disprove it.
I for one wish that Dr. Tyson had allowed
to stand your quotullon of him
originally, "Christ made LI clear that
His ideal of marriage was one man for
one woman eternally." Paui- Spkrht.

Harlem Lane.
The Itond In Older Xew York Where
There Was Xo Speed Limit.
To The Nbw York Herald: In the
hist paragraph of Mr. Dreyer'a letter
he says that "this was the time when
Third avenue was called Harlem lane."
As to this I differ with him, a* I well
remember many Saturday trips to Harlem
011 the Third avenue street car?
trips to Mrs. Itiley's boathouse on the
Harlem ltlver below the railroad bridge,
where we kept our boats. Harlem lane
was the speedway of the time, where
I remember seeing many famous trotters.
We reached Harlem lane by Central
Park, going up the Hast Drive, observing
the speed limit, and on to the
lane, where the speed of one's horse was
the only speed limit there was.
I have located the Hloomlngdalo road
all right, but am not sq sure about
I Harlem lane, though I think It must be
what would Vie a.u extension of Sixth
avenue or possibly Seventh avenue. I
am positive about emerging from the
park directly on the lane and well remember
slowing down as we approached
the park coming home, as they were
strict about speeding In the park.

Taucher Sings Pa
Sacred Character of Opera
in Special Pi
By W. J. HKNDERSOS.
"Parsifal" was given yesterday afternoon
at the Metropolitan Opera House.
It was a special performance, beginning
at 1 o'clock. "Parsifal" is always
a special. It does not readily tit into
the subscription series?not because it
is too long, for "Die Melstersinger" is
that?but because it Just is not opera.
Wagner said it was a sacred festival
play. It is no longer reserved for
either musical or religious festivals.
But it is also not to be offered as a
pleasant evening entertainment. It
becomes necessary therefore to set it
aside as something if not festal at
any rate sacred.
It Is much to the credit of\he Metrnnnllfnn

Institution that "Parsifal" continues
to be given with respect for Its character
and in most part for Its traditions.
It would be easy to m&kc a catalogue
of the faults of detail observed
in yesterday's performance, faults in
the scenic attire, faults in action, in
interpretation and even in the general
musical scheme. For there were such
faults, but it is not necessary to make
much of them.
The scene used for the first picture
had been improved since last season
by changing the color of the' lake and
moving it closer to the cut drop, and
the action was Improved by a rearrangement
of the groupings. Similur
small changes were noticeable in other
parts of the drama. The chorus in tho
first Monsalvat scene did not appear
to be certain of tho pitch or the stage

religious feeling translated Into skillful
theatrical terms.
It would be possible to question
som? of Mr. Bodanzky's tempi, but
when the general result Is contemplated
It was good. The impersonations
of the principals were commendable,
though in some instances not of
large importance. Paul Bender's
Gumemanz stood forth as one of the
most satisfying in the cast. To the

human and comprehensible Ournrmauz.
He is not a singer 'of high
vocal accomplishments, and his ponderous
voice sometimes falls to respond
to his demands. But he treated
the dialogue of his part with so much
intelligence, with such a number of
significant details and with such
clarity of text that he added a large
measure of interest to the representation.
His Gurnrmanz was not a dull

A Prayer for Love.
I pray that Love will find me on a day
Not too much fretted by the common
tasks.
(Lord, Thou dost surely know a woman's
way
Of liking to be loved!) My spirit
asks
That for this once?tf Love should be
my lot?
I may go fortli to meet him Joyously,
As olio on terms with haoninoss. anil not
Bowed by tbr dally cares that fall
on me.
But If the lighter way be never mine,
The little, foolish fancies of the heart,
Lord, by Thy grace this folly I resign
So only Thou shouldst give me for
my part?
Though torn by toll the youth that
once was I?
If Love should come he will not pass
me by.

Christmas Appeal for fhe National
Training School.
To Tub New York Hkrai.d : For
nearly ten years tho National Training
School for colored people at Durham.
N. C., has made an annual appeal for
gifts of any description for distribution
among the poor or to aid the school >n
Its own extension program or for current
expenses. Tho responses In the
past have been generous.
Tills year we again appcaJ for aid.
One-tenth of the population of the
United States Is negro, nearly 33 per
rent, of It Is Illiterate. The negro must
be assisted to acquire the training
needed to be an intelligent. Independent,
reliable workman In whatever field his
particular talents inav*eiigage. This can
be done only through schoolo teaching
lersons of sa-nlty and reason.
The private and denominational
schools of the South have been the greatest
force for civic, moral and Industrial
uplift. I appeal, therefore, for gifts for
schools of reputation In the South and
the many small colleges which are fighting
it tremendous battle ugulnst great
odds for existence.
The. National Training School will be
glad to receive money or gifts of any
kind for Its own needs and then also
will be glad to receive gifts of any dnacrlptlon
for distribution among the
poor of the community, the State and
the South. Jamkb K. tStiEPAsn,

number Hans Klndler appeared as the i
soloist, playing Halo's I) minor cello t
concerto with orchestra, in place of (
Bronlslaw Hubertnan in tho Brahms j
violin concerto. Mr. Kir.dler's performance
of the Lalo concerto was very t
artistic. The work Is somewhat tiio- |
notonous In development and lacks body. f
but It has some charming melody, es- t
pecially In the intermezzo, and It Incites t
Interest by taxing the player's technical t
powers. Mr. Ktndler's fllnesse and ele- ,
gance of style were pleasing throughout f
his delivery of the score, and he was (
warmly applauded. j

DANIEL WOLF FLAYS PIANO.
Paniel Wolf. Baltimore composer and
pianist, tratued In this country, and 1
claiming direct descent from Meyer- '
beer and Mendelssohn, gave his annual
piano recital here, last evening In Aeolian
Hall. His varied program, wanting
In any of his own compositions. Included
Mozart's "Pastorale Varie,"
Beethoven's sonata, opus 31, No. 3;
Debussy's "Dansenses de Delphes," and
"l.e Vent Dans la Plaine." and SalntSacns's
"Ktude en Forme do Vulse.'*
.Mr. Wolf played his music with technical
skill and understanding, but his
tonal range cooly tinted, rather than
liquid and warm. Ho seems to be a
player bent upon exposing the structural
form of a work rather than show* .
Ing its tender poetic values. The audience
liked his plnyfhg, as was manifested
by the applause.
