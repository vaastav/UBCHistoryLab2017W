of action to bo followed by the
Democrats has not been determined
on but It Is said a resolution will be
presented to carry the recommenda

An effort will undoubtedly be
made to put the house on record as

the Alaskan coal fields nro not
threatened or endangered under
existing conditions
Speaking ot tho Cunningham
claims tho committee finds that it
would be improper for them to pass
upon the merits ot these claims and
thus prejudice them while they are
pending If they are regular tho
report says patents should bo al
lowed 1 It they are fraudulent the
claims should be cancelled Tho
claimants are entitled to arc Im
partial judgment upon their rights
In tho premises
It is said the committee found no
reason to doubt that tho commis
stoner of tho general land office with
nn appeal to the secretary of tho In
tenor would decide these cases
fairly and Impartially but because of
tho Imputations heaped upon them It
Is recommended that a law bo en
acted for tho transfer of these and
any other cases involving claims to
Alaskan coal lands to an appropriate
court for a hearing and a decision
Concerning1 the future of Alaskan
coal lands the report makes a
definite recommendation in1 favor ot
tho leasing system which also was
favored by President Taft In his
message to congress Tho recom
mendation follows
Your committee believes it would
be tho height of unwisdom to < per
mit these great coal fields to be
monopolized or gathered Into tho
private ownership of a few for specu
lative purposes As they Increase In
value tho increment should inure to
the benefit ot all the people
To bring about this result and at
the same time put an end to tho un
reasonable conditions now exlsltlng
your committee recommends that the
government refuse to sell tho lands
but that retaining their ownership It
tiaU grant leases at fair royalties for
periods limited long enough and
covering areas largo enough to
Justify the necessary investments
upon sound business principles and
thus secure the opening and opera
tion of sufficient mines to meet the
necessities ot Alaskan consumpUon
afford relief from the present out
rageous prices paid by consumers
and at the samo time afford some
revenue to tho government We
recommend Loglstatlon to that end
and that pending such legislation I
tho existing withdrawal from entry
ot the Alaska coal lands bo made
Denounces Claris
As to the < conduct of llr G la via In
the long period in which tho Alaska
coal claim cases wore undor his con
trol as special agent ot tho lanjl
office the report declares ho bad
sufficient time and abundant assist
ance to make the field examination
which he bad demanded
demandedIn
In this connection tho committee
says
If his demand was In good faith
Claris was greatly remtes In his duty
In not having the examination mado
thenCommenting
Commenting upon the blanket
withdrawals of public lands which
wore made l > y James II Garfield
whoa secretary of the Interior the
committee says this action was taken
by him after ho ascertalnoti that ho
would not be reappointed under
President Taft It to said these
withdrawals wero made haphazard
from tho more Inspection of tho land
office state maps
Many of these lands were restored
to tho public domain by Secretary
Dalllnger and a portion were again
set aside The rewlthdrawali1 ac
cording to the committee wero mode
by Secretary BaUinger after a care
ful examination of tho maps data
and reports in tho geographical sur
vey and It Is bold that the rewith
drawals embraced all the power sites
