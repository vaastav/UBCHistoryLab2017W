t It looks as if by the time the fight
concerning the Irish leadership is ended
there will be nothing to lead.
It seems to be a question now whether
the Demjcratic party will swallow the
Farmers' Alliance or be swallowed by it.
TnE Democratic press is not pleased
to learn that the President has recalled
Minister Mizner. It has spoiled a stock
of thunder manufactured for that special
0
case.
Wiien a Cleveland man talks about'
the Democratic candidacy for President,
ho assumes that his favorite enjoys the
proprietorship. But his trade-mark is
not recorded yet.
Having ceased the Cleveland policy
of trafficking in British ideasand models
for naval ships and ordnance, the gov
ernment is pushing to the front of naval
ship-building and gunnery.
Those who go to investigating the
utterances of the Alliance leaders in
Florida will come across a lively Demo
cratic microbo before they apply a very
powerful maguifying-glass.
TnE difference between an Alliance
Democrat in the South and a Democrat
who is not a member of the Alliance
seems to bo that the former belongs to a
secret organization and is taxed to pay
a corps of officials large salaries.
The Atlanta (Ga.) Constitution re
marks that a third-party Farmers' Alli
ance would be "impracticable in the
South." True; only one party is al
lowed to vote in that section, and that
party has a patent on the privilege
w'Liih it is not judicious to infringe at
the present time.
Clerk McPherson, of the House of
Representatives, has just had printed
the unofficial list of members-elect of
the next House, showing eighty-eight
Republicans, 234 Democrats and eight
Farmers' Alliance. One district (Twen
ty-eighth New York) is set down as un
certain, and one (Second Rhode Island)
is marked vacant. It looks very much
as, if the Democrats would have a ma
jority. '
The same papers that censured the
President for not recognizing the Bra
zilian iepublic also censured - him for
not recalling Minister Mizner. Since the
Brazilian government has. sent a gold
medal to commemorate the prompt action
of the administration hi recognizing the
republic and the President's message
i shows that Mizner was recalled some
time ago, the know-it-all papers have
nothing to say.
A new organization has been formed
in Kansas, called the Knights of Reci
procity. Reciprocity is well enough.
but let us have done with the term
knights. It never did mean much, and
in modern times it stands for nothing
but a useless reminiscence. There would
be nothing so utterly ridiculous in the
nineteenth century as the reproduction
ot a real lenight, and the imitation
article is even worse.
The Italian government crushed the
Mafia out of Sicily by suspending the
3 cry law. Governor Tillman, of South
Carolina, asks the Legislature to help
him wipe out raco cruelties by giving
him power to peremptorily remove any
sheriff who does not do his whole duty.
in arresting known criminals. Those
two facts may 6erve as valuable hiuts to
the Indiana Legislature if it desires to
blot the ugly stain of White-capism
from the fair name of the State.
TnE New York Tribune gives the
population of Nevr York city and sur
rounding cities and towns in 1870. 18S0
and 1890, which shows an average gain
for all during the past decade of 31.93
per cent., against a gain of 33.3 per cent.
during the decade of 1870-80. If the
claim of Tammany were admitted, the
gain during the last decade would be 45
per cent. The Tribune is confident that
these figures show tho general accuracy
of tho census of 1890 for that city.
Congressman Vaux asks what the
dependent relatives of the soldiers ever
did for the country during its death
grapple with the Confederacy, to which
question the Philadelphia Times makes
the would-be facetious reply that "they
stayed at home and attended the prima
ries, of course." Of course they did. It
was highly necessary that somebody
should stay at homo and see that the
members of Congressman Vnux'a party
did not turn tho country over into tho
hands of the Confederacy.
TnE latest Democratic scheme is to in
duce tho Farmers1 Alliance of tho dif
ferent States to run separate presiden
tial tickets, in tho hope of throwing the
election for President into the House of
Representatives. As the House elected
last November will hold till March 4,
1893, this would insure a Democratic
President. From a Democratic point of
view, it ia a good scheme, and all the
better because it involves making a
cat's-paw of the Farmers' Alliance and
ignores the fact that the President
would be elected in 1893 by a House of
Representatives elected in 1890.
HAVE WE A REPUBLICAN SENATE?
The present session of Congress will
expire March 3, 1891. Congress never
gets down to steady work before the
holidays, and the holiday adjournment
will carry the session beyond the first of
the new year. Practically, therefore,
there are only about sixty working days
in the session. And yet, at the begin
ning of this short session, and with the
prospect of unusual limitations and ob
structions, we find the majority in the
Senate hesitating as to whether they
will change the rules so as to give them
power to limit debate. The real ques
tion is just as it was in the House a year
ago-whether the majority shall control
the Senate or allow the minority to do
so. In such a situation, and in view of
the important measures demanding the
attention of the Senate, it is astonishing
to find the majority hesitating as to the
propriety of changing the rules so as to
enable them to exercise the control to
which they are constitutionally entitled.
The question is in no sense a party
one. It is not a question of gaining a
partisan advantage or enacting partisan
legislation. It is a question of preserv
ing the autonomy of the Senate, assert
ing its character as a deliberative body,
establishing the constitutional rights of
the majority and preventing the Senate
from being controlled by a revolution
ary faction whose sole motto is rule or
ruin. The Democratic plan of campaign
is openly avowed and well known. It is
to take advantage of the loose rules and
rigid traditions of the Senate in such a
way as to prevent the majority from
passing any measures except such as the
minority may consent to. To submit to
such dictation would be cowardly in the
extreme, and to hesitate in putting an
end to it is little less so.
The present situation is a fitting op
portunity to remind the majority in the
Senate that if they had shown a
proper degree ot nerve in deal
ing with this question last ses
sion the Republican party would
probably be in much better, shape than
it is at present. The McKinley bill
might easily have .been passed by the
Senate at least six weeks before it was,
and this would have left ample time to
have passed the election bill if the ma
jority had assorted their constitutional
rights. But the so-called "courtesy of
the Senate" and its milk-and-water
rules prevented. The rules could easily
have been changed without endangering
the "courtesy of the Senate," if that
antiquated humbug is worth preserving,
but the majority frittered away week
after week until the golden opportunity
was lost. Finally, the McKinley bill
was passed just in time to do the most
possible harm, and the election bill was
not passed at all. This was the result
of the bulldozing tactics of the minority.
It cannot be asserted positively that the
result of the November elections would
have been different if the tariff bill had
been passed six weeks sooner and the
election bill soon if ter, but there are
thousands of Republicans who think and
talk that way. Therefore we say it is
astonishing to find the majority, at the
beginning of a short session, again hesi
tating and deliberating whether they
will shape the legislation of the session
or allow the minority to do so.
The President is reported as having
said to a Republican Senator recently:
"You want the bankruptcy bill passed;
you want the apportionment bill passed;
you want the appropriation bills passed,
and you want the election bill passed, and
you are in a position to know that all
this work cannot be accomplished in the
few short months of this session. Very
well, then; thero is only one thing
to bo done revise your rules and
pass them all." Bravely and wisely
said. Tho President speaks as one who
has served in tho Senate, who knows the
weakness of ita rules, knows the spirit
of the bulldozing Democracy, and knows
also the importance of the measures now
awaiting action by the Senate. We would
like to see some Republican Senator,
with the courage of his convictions,
make this statement of the President's
the text of an appeal to the majority to
do their duty, and then we would like
to see them do it. The Republican party
has never made anything by knuckling
down to traitors, bulldozers and revo
lutionists, and it cannot be expected
to approve of anything that savors of
that policy. The majority in the Sen
ate should do its duty, and do it
promptly. If the Senate is Republican
let us know it.
THE LATEST POLITICAL OUTRAGE.
The Supreme Court of South Carolina
has recorded the edict of its Democratic
bosses by deciding in favor of the Dem
ocratic contestant in the Seventh con-
giessional district in that State. The
district is overwhelmingly Republican,
having been purposely made so by a
Democratic gerrymander. At tho last
election the Republican candidate was
elected by a large majority, but as the
Democrats had taken a notion to have a
solid delegation, they concluded to
throw him out. The only pretext that
could be found on which to base their
action was the fact that the Republican
tickets were a littlo narrower than tho
legal requirement. The difference was
hardly discernible by measurement, but
it was enough. On this frivolous pretext
the -canvassing board rejected all the
Republican ballots and gave tho
certificate to tho Democrat, In order to
fortify their action, which was con
demned by the Democratic Attorney
general, they took tho case to tho Su
premo Court, where it was understood
in advance that tho decision would sus
tain the action of the board. It does,
and the result is one of the greatest po
litical outrages on record. In the faco
of such proceedings Democratic talk
about tho alleged injustice of tho "force
bill" is simply insulting. Tho Washing
ton Post, a paper which has opposed,
and still opposes, the national election
law, says:
The Post sinceroiv trnsts that when the
South Carolina Senators come to raise their
voices in opposition to the passage of the
federal elections bill they will show their
courage and their love of justice by de
nouncing the political outrage recently per
petrated in their own State. There
never was a clearer case of political theft,
and the Southern Democrat woo is not pre
pared to denounce this outrage is in no con
dition to declare against federal control of
elections.
The facts in this case will be studi
ously concealed by the Democratic press
of the North, which will continue to
howl about "tho infamous force bill."
WAGES AND PRICES,
A reader of the Journal, who signs
himself "Mechanic," asks how much
clothing has advanced since the passage
of ttie McKinley bill, how much it is like
ly to advance, aud how much better off
American workmen would really bo un
der free tradd.
Wo assume that the writer refers to
ready-made clothing, as that is the kind
worn probably by nine-tenths of tho
American people. There is no reason
why they should wear any other, as
ready-made clothing is good enough for
anybody, and is much better and cheaper
in this country than in any other. Such
clothing has not advanced at all, and
is not likely to. It never was cheaper
than it is at present, as a glance at the
advertising columns of the Journal from
day to day will show. A good all-wool
suit,, well-made, well-fitting and ser
viceable, can bought anywhere from 810
to $15, according to the taste of the pur
chaser. There never was a time when
ready-made clothing could be bought
cheaper, and there are no indi
cations of an advance. On the
7
contrary, it is quite likely clothing will
be still cheaper. Competition is still at
work, and, with the increased produc
tion of American wool under the new
tariff, next year may see even lower
prices for ready-made clothing than
those which now prevail. No ready-
made clothing is imported. The Ameri
can article is so much superior that
there would bo no object in importing
it. The increased duty on certain classes
of woolen goods and trimmings that en
ter into tho manufacture may cause an
increase in the price of clothing made of
imported materials, but if this happens
it will only affect high-priced clothing.
Almost all the ready-made clothing sold
is made of American goods. ;
The question of wages and tho ability
to buy is as important as that of price.
The effect of free trade would be to de
stroy American woolen-mills, 'unless
wages in this country were "reduced
nearly or quite to a level with European
wages. The stoppage of numerous mills
and factories would throw an army of
persons out of employment, labor would
be a drug in tho market, and wages
would fiink to a very low point.: 'If
they dropped 50 per cent, they would
still be as high as European wages.; Sup
pose, then, that American factories were
stopped, American wages reduced 50 per
cent, and our ready-made clothing
made of imported goods. In the ab
sence of American competition :t is high
ly probable that the foreign manufact
urers and importers would put iirv prices
to a much higher point than those '.wjiicri
now prevail; but suppose they did not.
Suppose that the prices of ready-made
clothing should fall 10, 15 or even 20 per
cent., so that a suit that now costs $12
could be bought for S8.50, and a
suit that now sells for $15 would sell for
$12. An average man wears two suits a
year, and the saving on two; $15 suits
would be $6. But his wages, :.if he
should be so fortunate as to have work,
would be 50 per cent, less than they are
now. Instead of getting $2 per day he
would get but $1. Thus he would Bave,
perhaps, $6 or $8 a year in the cost of
his clothing and lose from $250 to $000 a
year in wages. These figures might be
varied considerably, and tho. result
would still be largely in favor of the
present system. If free trade would re
duce the cost of clothing much more
than we have estimated and the rate cf
wages much less, the American work
man would still be largely the loser. I
The Sentinel devotes one of its amus
ing tariff editorials to trying to prove
that the duty on raw materials prevents
American manufacturers from compet
ing with foreigners. It evidently thinks
there is a duty on raw cotton, raw tin,
raw hides, raw lumber, raw sand for
making glass, etc. Somebody should
send the Sentinel a copy of the tariff
law. In it will bo found the following
provision:.
That where imported materials on which
duties have been paid are used in tho man
ufacture of articles manufactured or pro
duced in tho United States, there shall bo
allowed on the exportation of nuch articles
a drawback equal in amount to the duties
paid on tho materials used, less 1 per centum
of such duties.
Under that provision, if imparted ma
terials are used in this country in manu
facturing goods for export, the manu
facturer is allowed a rebate of 99 per
cent, of tho duties paid. But no reader
of the Sentinel will over hear of the ex
istence of this provision, so far as that
paper is concerned.
In its report of the lecture of Rev. Mr.
McCulloch on General Booth's book,
"Darkest England," the Sentinel prints
the following; .
"In the introduction to his book." said
the Kov. McCulloch, "Booth states that
Englaud, from Plymouth to Petermouth,
contains three millions ot starving, homo
less paupers, and the city of London alone
has almost one million of this class, whose
moral darkness and infamy can only be
compared to Stanley's revelations concern
ing the dwarfs of Africa. These are the
dwarfs of civilization and Christian Eng
land must do somethiug for them."
And yet this wretchedness, which is
more extensive and hopeless than in
any other civilized country, is in the one
free-trade country of the world which
has sacrificed everything to cheapness,
even its own agriculture, in order to
world.
A Democrat in Kansas, in a recent in
terview, said, among other things:
1 was in Arkansas City just before elec
tion, and overheard one of the Alliance
leaders say to a member of the order: "I
hear you are going to vote the Republican
ticket. If that's so, aud you do vote it, you
can't stay iu this county twenty-tour
hours." Now, this conversation was in
earnest, and it wan emphasized with oaths
aud in a manner which led me to believe
that tbe member thus threatened would be
in danger of his life if be voted any ticket
except that furnished by the Alliance. I
have no doubt this sort of bulldozing was
employed in t her sections of the State, and
the same ki;.-l of threats are now being
made againat Alliance members of tbe
Legislature who shall dare to vote for
Ingalls for United States Senator.
Such tactics should have ceased in
Kansas when the party of "free soil and
free speech" drove the " border ruffians
and murderers of free State men out of
that State.
Governor Tillman, of South Caro
lina, said in his message: "When it is
shown that a majority of the colored
voters are no longer imbued with Re
publican ideas, the vexed negro ques
tion will be solved." Which means that
his ignorance and his race are not ob
jectionable, but that he is proscribed for
his political views.
The Maryland liquor-license law forbids
the granting of a license to an alien, aud
tho Supreire Court of that State h3s just
tie Id the law constitutional. Ja a test case
made by the Liquor-dealers' Association on
behalf of an. alien to whom Hconse had
been ref nsed, the court says:
The power of the Legislature over the whole
subject under the Constitution of the State can
not be denied. The law -we are considering was
an effort to restrict the licenses to such persons
as would not abuse the privilege, and the oprn
roission had the power to refuse the license to an
unlit person, or tf the license was not necessary
for the accommodation of the public. It was
thought proper to contine the licenses to citizens
of this United States of temperate habits and
good moral character. It seemed wise to the
Legislature to confer it only on those who, being
natives of the country, ml -.it reasonably be sup
posed to have a regard for its welfare: or who,
not being natives, had, as required by the
naturalization laws, proven, by creditable testi
mony before a court of jnstiee, that they were
attached to the principles of the United States
and were well disposed to their order and happi-.
ncsa. It was certainly the function of the law
making department to exercise its judgment on
this question, and this court has no right to criti
cise its conclusion.

Old King Kalakaua is doing a very neat
thing in trying to sell the Hawaiian Islands
to the United States. Americans, being
practically the only tax-payers on those
islands, have been supporting the King for
years, and they also monopolize the trade
with that country. He has reached a con
dition of bankruptcy and is shrewd enough
to understand that he can better himself
by giving up the forms of royalty and turn-
ing over his kingdom to the people who are
most deeply interested in its prosperity.
There is no probability that the natives
will object to the transfer if Kalakaua and
his court are willing to retire.

GORDON PAYS THE PRICE.
His Initiation Into the Alliance Shows How
He Gained His Election to the Senate.
Atlanta Constitution.
Senator John B. Gordon is an Alliance
man. lie has. at least, accepted an invita
tion to join tbe order, and the ceremonies
attendant upon his initiation will be con
ducted in solemn form Tuesday afternoon.
Senator Gordon was to have been initiated
last Friday afternoon by the sub-Alliance
at Decatur, but for some reason it was post
poned. The rumor, yesterday, that circu
lated through tbe lobbies at tbe Capitol
that the initiation would occur in Room 21,
which is the room of the agricultural com
mittees of tbe House, at 3 o'clock in the
afternoon, caused quite a little sensation
among the legislators, and everybody
wanted to get at tbe bottom of its Butrit
was simply a rumor nothing more. Those
who know all about it say that the time
is fixed for Tuesday afternoon, at 3
o'clock, and the initiation will most likely
occur in the lodge-room of the Decatur Alli
auce. borne of tbe farmers in the House of
Kepresentatives, however, say that arrange
ments have been made to have the Decatur
Alliance come to i Atlanta in a body and
conduct tbe ceremonies in Room 21. of the
Capitol, so as to allow each of the Alliance
legislators a chance to witness the notable
event.
Mr. Tatum, tbe Representative of Dade
county in the House, said, yesterday, a
reporter: . 1
'Oh yes. Gordon is going to join the Alli

invited to go down to Decatur, Fridav, to
witness the swearing in, hut it has been
postponed until Tuesday evening. It was
rumored that the initiation was to have
taken place this evening, in the Capitol,

NIHILIST MEDHX.
Halstead Expresses His Opinion, and lie
calls that of Horace Greeley.
M. Halstead, in Cincinnati Commercial Gazette. -
About the tariff just now I have but one
feeble thought, and that is. I would be
willing to make any small sacrifice I could
aflord if my excellent and so often admir
able old friend Medill. of tbo Chicago Trib
une, could be persuaded not to instruct us
so much, so very much, about tariff. I re
member that be would have it the Mc
Kinley platform on which Harrison was
elected should be destroyed. Tbe truth is
Joe Medill, dear as he is to all of us, as one
of the great, and good, aud grand old men,
is a Nihilist yes, sir, a confounded old
Nihilist of the thirty-third degree and
if he had started early, that is to
say, if he had developed his devil
ment in youth, as he has in ad
vanced years, he would have been a terror,
he would have beaten the terrible Tolstoi,
not as Tolstoi has done, but he would have
been a giddy destroyer. I would read tbe
editorial page of the Tribune myself if it
were not for tbe taritl' articles. Come to
think of it, that Chicago Tribune is a won
derful paper. Think of it! as long ago as
when Horace Greeley was in full fighting
force, that Mr. Greeley broke out of his
room one day when the oflice boy bad de
livered the exchanges, saying, shrieking, as
ho threw the Chicago Tribune after the
child, "Here, bring me no more Chicago
Tribunes. Never bring me any more Chi
cago Tribunes. Damn the Chicago Trib
une!" Dear Mr. Greeley should bave said
God bless the Chicago Tribune. That great
paper has done more good by being bad
than any other journal, living or dead. I
shall not undertake to say just how it was
done; but the Republicans would not have
carried this country in l&SS if it had not
been for tbe assistance received from the
Tribune.
ALL 3ICST HAVE PIE.
The Farmers Cannot De Allowed to Enjoy
All the Good Things.
New York Snn.
The Alliance farmers cannot expect to
enjoy the privilege of borrowing money
from the United States at a nominal rate of
interest, and giving their farms as security,
unless they give persons in other occupa
tions Home equal privilege. It wonldbea
great scheme for the Alliance mortgagee to
get a pot of money at 1 per cent, from the
government and lend it at 8 or 10 to persons
standing in need of financial assistance,
and unable to obtain it easily and cheaply
on account of not being farmers. The
farmers aro worthy aud thrifty people, but
they cannot be allowed to become
a privileged class, a sort of landed
aristocracy, borrowing money cheap and
lending it dear. Thoy do not absolutely
own tbe earth, although they cultivate it.
There are soveral millions of persons in
these United Stateawho are not farmers,
and yet are as ready as the horniest-handed
to borrow money from the government.
They know a pudding when they see it,
and they will insist on being helped to
some of it. If Brother Hawbuck is to get
from tbe government what inonev he needs.
Brothers Butcher, Baker and Candlestick
maker must get what money tbey want
from tbe same benevolent banker on tbe
same torms. They can give them stock,
the good will of their business, their own
skill and indnstry. and shrewdness as se
curity. A laborer with his hands can
pledge them as security for a government
loan. We can't all have farms; but if tbe
government is going to run a pawn-shop it
must take everything otiered as a pledge
for its advance.
They Object to "the Proper Adjective.
Philadelphia Inquirer. ' ' J
As the Farmers' Alliance is the newest
movement iu what may bo called, for want
of a better term, social politics, its course
on social questions is of almost, if not quite,
as much interest as its plan of political
campaign, and this is especially the case
when tho question has both aspects, as in
the woman's rights movement. We gather
from a very complete report of tho Ocala
convention that there is a considerabla
number of "women delegates" in that body.
We should prefer to call them "female dele
gates," since it is obviously cacologicaj to
use the correlative term "men delegates:
but the ladies won't have it that way.
For some reason they object to being called
"female" this or that, and insist on being
officially recognized as "women." So
"women delegates" it is, and the male dele
gates must so speak of them.
Ex-Con greBm an Townsend Talks.

"Do you hear any talk of Mr. Blaine oat
West!"
"I wish to prick the Blaine bubble right
here. Mr. Blaine is a friend of mine and I
admire him very much. He 13 not a candi
date for the presidency, lie told me so him
self. 1 had a long conversation with hirn
one day and be said that be bad been a candi
date several times and failed of nomination
When he did get it he was defeated and ho
thought that was enough. His ambition,
be added, was to fultill the duties of Secre
tary of State in a way that would reflect
credit upon the country and himself. He
was tired of tho political excitement in
volved in a presidential race. I believe Mr.
Blaine, and while he is popular and his
reciprocity ideas have been hailed with ex
pressions of approval everywhere, I do not
think the siren voice of the political maiden
will change him from bis resolution not to
become a candidate. Mr. Blaine is a big
man aud has a large following, but I do noc
think that either he or any of the prominent
statesmen now before the public will be a
candidate for the presidency in 1 ou the
Republican ticket,"

What Constitutes a Nation.
Lyman Abbott, In December Century.
Fifty millions of people on three millions'
of square miles of territory do not consti
tute the United States of America. A
million or so of people occupying twenty
one thousand square miles did not consti
tute Greece. It was the Greeks who con
stituted Greece: it is Americans who con
stitute America. So man' people thrown
together on one territory no more make a
nation than so many blocks of stone thrown
together in a pile make a temple, or so many
types in pi a book, cr so many threads in a
tangle a fabric.
Every nation has its own distinguishing
features, its own type of character, its own
consciousness, its own life. To constitute a
nation, there must be not only people, and
land, and laws, but laws that are self
evolved, literature that is the expression
of national life, language fitted to express
that life, and, therefore, a life to be ex
pressed.
Not to Be Stampeded.
San Francisco Chronicle. x
The free-trader who in the House of Rep
resentatives on Monday declared that the
people had pronounced against the McKin
ley bill takes too many things for granted
Even if the contest had been made on tho
tariff issue solely it would hardly be the
thing to accept a verdict bassed on false
representations. The McKinley bill is the
law of the land and will remain on the
statue books until it gets a fair trial. If it
does not work as its authors expected it to
the Republicans will be the first to advocate
its revision.
Waiting for the Letter That Never Came.
Nebraska Journal.
If Mr. Cleveland is anxious to send out
another letter to a confidential friend fot
publication he might fill several pages with
a discussion of his position on tbe silver
auestion, accompanying the text with a
iagram and copious foot-notes. Silver is
going to be one of the big issues two years
hence out West, and before all the pri
maries are fixed for tbe New York states
men the hoys would like to know his inten
tions with respect to tbe white metal.
Dishonest Quotation.
Philadelphia Manufacturer's Record.
The mendacity of the free-trade journals
still continues. A favorite form of it is the
quotation by tbe Democratic press of de
nunciations of the law by such papers aa
the Chicago Tribune, which is always
named as "a leading Republican journal of
the West" whereas the Chicago Tribune
for years has been as ardent an advocate of
free trade as the London Times, a fact with
which the ordinary reader in. this part of
the country of course is unacquainted.
A Failure Due in 1892.
Nebraska JonrnaL
Among the "disastrous effects of iua
McKinley bill" the Democratic journals
place the failure of a New York firm that
speculated largely on the predicted "rise"
in values of various kinds of merchandise
when the bill should pass, and as things
didn't "rise" the firm is in a hole. This isn't
the last disaster of this sort that the Demo
cratic brethren will have to record. The
Democratic party has invested heavily on
the McKinley bill in the same line.

The ruthless iconoclast is still abroad in

It is understood that the Senate has
reached a tacit agreement that no recess

"If Mr. Cleveland is not elected in
