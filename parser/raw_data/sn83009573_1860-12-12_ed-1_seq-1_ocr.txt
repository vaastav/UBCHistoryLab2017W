BALTIMORE, Dec. 11,1860.
There was a very decided improvement in stocks at
New York to-day, but the market here was dull and
heavy for everything except Baltimore and Ohio Rail
road, which was a shade better than on yesterday. There
were 150 shares of this stock sold, 100 at SSO, and 50 at
sso# cash, and It closed at sso# bid, ssl asked regular
way, these figures being an advance of $1 on the closing
quotations of ,y . Kvilliura Central Railwa.*
oharefl and bonds were both quite heavy, the bonds being
especially so. There were 400 ol the shares sold at sl3# (a)
13#, these figures being a decline of # to # of a dollar
on yesterday's closing price, aifd we note sales of $6,500
of the 1885 bonds at 50, which is a decline of 4# per cent,
on the last sales, which were made on Saturday. The
bonds were offered at the close at 50, but only 49 was bid
for them, and the shares left off at sl3# bid. sl3# asked
regular way. A sale of SI,OOO Baltimore and Ohio Rail
road 1880 bonds was made at the Board at 77, which i 9 a
considerable decline on any previous sale, and they closed
at 75 bid, 77 asked. Baltimore City C's were very heavy
to-day, but there was but little done in them, the only sale
made being one of $1,500 1875' sat 90#, this figure being
a decline of 3# per cent, on the price obtained for tlum
yesterday. For 18S6'a only 89 was bid, and 1890*3 closed
at 92 bid, 94 asked. There were sales of 100 shares Can
ton Co. at sl3 cash, this figure being the same that was
obtained for it a day or two since, and we note also a sale
of 80 shares Citizens' Bank at $lO. There was very little
done to-day in Mining stocks, the sales embracing only
100 shares Gardner Hill at $215, and 200 shares Spring
field at $1.90. The market for this class of stocks was
very heavy.
We see no change cither for the better or the worse in
the condition of the Money market. The banks continue
to supply the pressing wants of their customers, and some
occasional sales of first class paper are making on the
street at our previous quotations, viz. : 1 to 1# p rcent.
per month, but for the bulk of the paper offering there is
no market.

The Tribune of this morning says:
At the morning board there was a moderate degree of
activity in stocks, but the tone of the despatches in the
morning papers from the South were not encouraging,
and the improved feeling of Saturday afternoon were not
sustained. The general features of the market were much
the u arne as o>r tlie week a moderate amount of
purchases for cash by the public, who arc allured hy low
prices; the taking in of short stock, an unwillingness to
operate on time to any extent and gradually declining!
quotations. Among the heaviest securities were Govern- I
ments stocks and railroad bonds. Government 6's 1867
sold at 95, a decline of 8* per cent. The s's of 1874 sold
at 89, and there was very little demand at any price
These sales were made by timid parties who fear the
treasury will be entirely bankrupt before January. We
presume, b°wevcr, that Congress will before that time
authorize some financial expedient which will enable the
Secretary to pay the interest. State stocks were also
heavy but without important change.
On demand, money is moderately abundant at 6'a.7 per
cent. Paper continues to go very slowly at 15(3)18 per
cent, for the best double name. Dry goods signatures ap
pear to be suffering under greater distrust than any other
description, -and we hear of none passing below 18 per
cent. Treasury Notes are very much depresed. and have
sold as high as 6 per cent, discount for those due next
month. Importers are buying them for the payment of
duties at 2X(3 ; 3 per cent, discount The domestic ex
changes do not improve, except on Philadelphia, which is
down to 2((12X ptr cent. On lialtimore the rate is worse
—3X®4 per cent, At Chicago the rate is 8qj)10 per cent.;
with but little offering merchants can scarcely expect
to receive remittances, while exchange stands at these
figures.
The foreign bill market is very much depressed, and the
best bankers' names can be bought at 102 for sterling,
and 5.50 for francs. A line of francs, of a very leading
name, sold to-day at 5 55. Prominent commercial and
hank sterling is 100@102, and document bills 9S@IOO.
The market is almost nomiual, the demand being very
limited.

The Boston Courier of Monday says :
The market was very dull to dav at the Board and by
auction, the great difficulty being in finding customers
at any price for a large class or the stocks offered. All
sellers and no buyers was the almost literal position of the
market. The transactions effected were generally at
lower rates, and the volume of business would have been
much larger at the Board had buyers been ready to take
stocks at what would apppear to be reasonable prices.
The money market the past week has shown no signs of
cheering improvement and borrowers have, we should
judge, been harder pressed than ever. The continued
and persistent decline in stocks has a very serious effect
upon borrowers, many of whom are "carrying" large
lots of them, principally bought in New York at prices
ranging from 15 to 30 per cent, above the present market
rates. Hardly any paper, even the best, lias been passed
at less than 15 percent; and very many good notes have
been discounted at 16 to 24 per cent. Occasionally some
fortunate individual may have succeeded in negotiating
his paper at 12 per cent., but this is an exception, and by
no means criterion of the market. The specie average of
the Boston Banks continues very low—
the managers are disposed to do all they can to accom
modate the business community.

[SPECIAL DESPATCH.]
WASHINGTON, December 11.—The debate in the
Senate to-day was not of a re-assuring character.
Mr. Iverson, of Georgia, announced the firm pur
pose of five States to secede before the 4th of March,
and he urged the border States to follow their ex
ample. lie addressed himself particularly to
Maryland and Virginia, and told them that if the}-
wished to preserve Washington as the seat of Gov
ernment of the Southern Confederacy, they should
act quickly. This elicited applause in the galle
ries. The balance of the day was spent in discus
sing the question whether or not the fugitive
slave law had been properly executed. The Re
publican Senators maintained almost entire si
lence. Mr. Wigfall has the floor in the morning.
There is again a difficulty in regard to the House
printing. Mr. Hunt, the Superintendent of Public
Printing, last night addressed a note to Speaker
Pennington, stating that Mr. I-'ord, the House
Printer, could notbe found, that the work was not
executed, and recommended the office to be de
clared vacant. Mr. Ford's locum tencns informs me
that Mr. F. has been lying sick for ten days at
Cleveland, Ohio, and that he has notified Mr. Hunt
that he is ready to go on with the work. Larcombe
& English, who are contractors under Ford, object
to proceeding, I learn, at present rates, and the ap
propriation for the work is said to be $30,000 short
of the price charged. The whole thing seems to be
very much mixed up.
The Pacification Committe will now be called
together, since the applications for excuse have
been disposed of. Little, however, is anticipated
to result from its deliberations.
Senator Bright, of Indiana, is seriously ill with
inflammatory rheumatism, and cannot resume his
duties for a month at least.

session, for the present service, to be subject to
discontinuance on ninety days' notice; and to con
tinue until otherwise ordered by Congress, incase
the daily overland mail contract is not taken within
the sum limited. The bill will be reported to the
House this week.

CITY INTEL LIE FN<F.
THE HOME OK THE FKIKNDLKSS. —The sixth anni
versary of the Home of the Friendless took place
last night in the Broadway Methodist Episcopal
Church. The attendance was not as large as it
should have been, though most of the fir3t and last
friends of this excellent institution were present.—
The Kev. Feilder Israel preached from Deuterono
my, 15th chapter, and from the 7th to the 11th
verses. In the discourse, which was both able and
eloquent, the Home was commended to the benevo
lence of the community, and the good which has
followed the labors of those who conduct it truth
tullyand beautifully portrayed. At the close of ttie
sermon R. Stockett Matthews, Esq , read a report
of the Secretary, which gave a succinct account of
the labors of the institution for the past year. It is
in pamphlet form, ready for circulation, and should
be read by all who have at heart the prosperity of
this important charity. At the last annual meeting
there were forty-two inmates in the institution,
and during the year there were received twenty
four. Eight haye been returned to their parent's,
nine provided with homes, six adopted, one
sent to the Church Home, two left without consent,
and one died; leaving, at this time, thirty-nine.
The report gives a clear exposition of the progress
made in the erection of the new edifice at the cor
ner of Ross and Townsend streets, and states that
in a few months it will be ready for occupancy.
When finished there will be a debt hanging over it
of SI,OOO. The generous benevolence which has
heretofore been extended to the Institution war
rants the presumption that the amount will soon
be liquidated. The building will have capacity for
the accommodation of 100 children, which will
enable the managers to largely increase their
usefulness. With this increase new demands will
have to be made for support, and it is confidently
hoped that liberal contributions will follow. The
report refers to the death of Prof. Charles Frick,
one of the most steadfast friends of the Institution,
whose life and character wereadorned and enriched
by "whatsoever things are lovely and of good
report."
The Rev. James Brown delivered abrief address,
after which a liberal collection was taken up, and
the meeting adjourned.
A VlUACO. —Yesterday mornrng quite an excite
ment was occasioned on Eastern avenue by a wo
man named Shultz making an attack on a young
man named L. 0. Milliss. Mrs. Shultz keeps a
small store on Eastern avenue, and was in the
habit of using a yard stick in the sale of goods
which was not tbo length which the law requires.
A few days since the Inspector of Measures, in
company with Mr- Milliss, called at her store and
she was compelled to get a new yard stick. A
notice of this affair appeared in the' Police Gazette,
together with comments on Mrs. Shultz's general
character, which is not very good. She took of
fence at this, and concluded that as Mr. Milliss was
with the Inspector on his visit, that it was he who
placed her in the I'olice Gazette, and, determined
on revenge, she yesterday morning prepared her
self with a piece of heavy rope and lay in wait for
Mr. Milliss. When that gentleman came along she
made an attack on him, but before she could strike
a blow, Mr. Milliss caught the rope, when she
threw a handful of Scotch suuff in his face, which
blinded him, and then struck him with her fist.
Milliss got clear of her without sustaining anv in
jury save that inflicted on his eyes by the snuff,
which is not serious.
INQUEST.— Coroner Gieentee was called upon yes
terday morning to hold an inquest over the body of
a man named Anthony McGuecan, alias "Billy
Boyle," aged C 8 years, living with his wife at No.
108 N. Calvert street, opposite Foundry. It ap
peared in evidence that the deceased had been sick
for three or four days past, and that at 4 o'clock
yesterday morning he complained greatly ofcramps.
To relieve him, his wife gave him some brandy and
cinnamon, after which he was more easy. At seven
o'clock, when his wife went to his bed, he was dead.
His daughter, who did not live with the father,
upon hearing of bis death, and not knowing of his
sickness, suspected that the wife of deceased, to
whom he had been recently married, had used some
foul means to get rid of her father, and demanded
an inquest. After hearing all the facts, the jury
rendered a verdict of death from old age and in
temperance. The deceased for along time held the
situation of collecting all the dead dogs, Ac., found
in the streets of the city.
SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER.— About one o'clock yes
terday morning officer Ilause arrested a man by
the name of Thomas Quinn, on the charge ofbeino
a suspicious character. The officer observed him
take off his coat and turn it, and then put it on
again. He also changed his hat in a similar manner.
U hen questioned by the officer Tor a reason for
his conduct, he gave no satisfactory reply, and
was accordingly taken to the station house. Justice
Griffin committed him to jail for an examination.
The frequency of burglaries oflate demand in
creased activity and watchfulness on the part of
the police, and all the vagrant loafers who infest
the city, and live by plunder, should be taken care
of according to law.
DESTITUTION. —A case of destitution was on Mon
day night brought to the notice of the police, of a
sickening character. A woman named Curtis, oc
cupying a portion of the garret of house No. 65
North Frederick street, was represented to be in
much want, and also that her only child w-as in a
dying condition. The police visited the garret, and
there found the woman seated on a stool, with her
babe dead in her arms. She sat there weeping over
the dead infant, without a friend or acquaintance
near. The only furniture in the room was a bed
and the stool upon which she was seated. Sergeant
Fields and officers Quinn and Bracken collected
some Sl2, to prepare the body for burial, and re
lieve the wants of the mother.
INCREASED CITY RAILWAY FACILITIES. —The Su
perintendent of the City Passenger Railway Cars
has ju-t issued a circular, stating that on and after
the 17th inst., cars will run regularly each night,
at intervals of half an hour, on the several lines of
the railway, between twelr-e o'clock midnight and
seven o'clock A. M. Time tables are published
this morning, giving the exact time at which the
cars will pass the difierent prominent corners, so
that those desiring to avail themselves of this ac
commodation will know the precise minute at which
they will meet a car at any given point. This
movement of the Railway Association will meet the
hearty approbation of our citizens, and will be a
great convenience. The fare between those hours
will be ten cents instead of five cents.
CASE OF SERIOUS BURNlNG.— Yesterday Charles
Coney, a boy between 8 and 9 years old,living with
bis parents on the corner of Light and Hamburg
streets, was terribly burned by accidentally falling
into a limekiln, of Air. Valentine, on Cross street,
near the Spring Gardens. It seems that the boy
was playing about the top of the kiln, and sudden
ly fell in upon the burning pile, having inhaled the
gases emanating from the place. He was observed
by a workman named Scott, who ran to the kiln
and quickly pulled him out. The boy was horribly
burnt in fill part? of the body. Dr. Wagner was
called to attend him, and considers him in a critical
condition.
RUNAWAY AND ACClDENT. —Vesterday afternoon,
about four o'clock, an elderly man, named Francis
i eters, was driving a horse attached to an express
wagon, down Fayette street, and when near Gay
street, the animal became frightened and dashed off
at a full run. The wheels of the wagon struck a
large stone, and Mr. Peters was thrown to the
ground. His right leg was broken, and he was se
verely bruised. Officer Darling procured a
and sent him to his homo on North Eden street,
near Jefferson street., where he received medical
attention.
ROBBERY. —On Monday night between 7 and 8
o'clock, the grocery store of Air. Winkle, on the
corner of Saratoga and Poppleton streets, was en
tered by a thief, who succeeded in carrying off' the
money drawer under the counter whilst the pro
prietor was engaged in the rear part of tbe store.
The "till" contained nearly ten dollars in change.
It was afterwards found on a lot in the vicinity,
minus the change.
ANOTHER. —Some time during Alonday night, a
country wagon, belonging to a gentleman in Balti
more county, which was left in the yard of the
Swan tavern, corner of Franklin and E'utaw streets,
was robbed of 12 pairs of nicely dressed chickens,
intended for the visitors of the Lexington market.
The theft was discovered by officer Young, who
lound several fowls lying loose near the pr rnises
at daybreak.
SODDEN DEATH. —Yesterday morning Coroner
Hall was called to hold an inquest over the body of
a young man named Jarrett Alahony,who was found
dead in his bed. It was in evidence before the
jury that Alahony was in excellent health and had
retired the night previous without any symptoms
of sickness. When his wife awoke in "the morning
he was lying at her side dead. The jury rendered
a verdict o' "death from heart disease."
LAW INTELLIGENCE.
CRIMINAL COURT—JUDGE BOND.
After the call of the Court and Grand Jury, Mr.
Whitney and his counsel, Cbas. H. Pitts, Esq.,
being present, Judge Bond remarked that as yet
he had been unable tn get any one to accept the
appointment of State's Attorney, to prosecute the
cases found by the Grand Jury against Air. Whit
ney. It was a question of grave importance both
to the community and to the party accused, that it
should have a full, fair, and impartial investiga
tion. The Court had applied to gentlemen of the
law to accept the appointment, in whose great
legal qualifications and legal acumen tbe commu
nity would have been satisfied in tbe performance
of the duties imposed, but they had all declined to
serve, for reasons which were' satisfactory to the
Court, and perfectly reasonable. The Court,
learning that the Hon. Reverdy Johnson had
returned from California, had written to that gen
tleman, asking him to accept the appointment, aDd
although a reply had not yet been received from
Air. Johnson, the Court felt great hope that that
gentleman would leel under obligation, both to tbe
community and to the profession, that the appoint
ment should be accepted, and that the pros
ecution should be undertaken upon bis part.
The Court further said that if this was
merely an appointment to be made by the
Court for an attorney to prosecute a case
before the Court, it would have the power to com
pel any member of tbe bar, upon the roll, to try
the ease; but this was an appointment of an officer
of the Court, and it had no power to compel an
acceptance of the office. Under the present, state
of aff airs, the Court thought that it would be best
to adjourn the Court until Saturday, when it had
hopes that a prosecuting attorney would be pre
sent to undertake the prosecution of these cases.—
Mr. Pitts here arose and said that in view of the
fact that the Grand Jury had presented Mr. Whit
ney for a misdemeanor, he would call the attention
of the Cou* t, and through it, the attention of the
Graud Jury, to a provision of the law iu regard to
presentments. In this case the Grand Jury have
presented Air. Whitney, and the names of certain
persons have been returned on the presentment as
witnesscs. By the Code of Public Laws of the State
of Maryland," CO sec., article 29, the accused is
entitled to know the party who has brought these
charges against him, as the law says—" Whenever
the grand jury shall find any presentment against
any person for a misdemeanor, they ehall endorse
on the presentment tbe name of the person at
whose instance such presentment is made, who
slial 1 be deemed and taken to be the person at
whose instance such prosecution was commenced."
Air. Whitney, said Air. Pitts, is presented by
the Grand Jury for a misdemeanor; be is ignorant
as to who set this prosecution on foot, and accord
ing to the laws of the State he has a right to know
at whose instance the presentments are made. Tbe
Grand Jury are then to disclose the name of the
particular person who pet on loot this prosecution,
bv endorsing on the presentment such person's
name. _ He would call the attention of tbe Court
and the Grand Jury to this informality in
J P resen tments. He would go further,
and in order to relieve the Court of
any embarrassment it might have in the premi
ses, he would call the attention of the Court to the
91st section, article 30tb, of tbe Code of Public
Laws, which says: "Any person presented or in
dicted, may, instead of traversing the same before
a Jury, traverse the same before the Court, who
BALTIMORE, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1860.
shall thereupon try the law and the facts." The
difficulty with the Court, said Mr. Pitts, seemed to
be that it could tind no one ready or willing to pre
pare the indictments; in that case they proposed to
traverse the presentments, and go to trial before
the Court, who would haveno difficulty in appoint
ing counsel, as then he could compel an attorney
to try them, as they were properly before the
Court. Judge Bond remarked that the difficulty
here arose, that if the Grand Jury desired to alter
or amend the presentments, as implied by
previous remarks of Mr. Pitts, they had
no State's Attorney to advise them or to
whom they might look for counsel. Mr. Pitts
said the presentments had been already filed by the
Grand Jury, aud if they traversed upon them the
matter was properly" before the Court, and al
though they might tind other presentments, they
would have to be disposed of, when brought in that
way before the Court. Judge Bond remarked,
that the Grand Jury may want to amend the pre
sentments, and they were certainly privileged to
have a legal adviser, as there was iiow no State's
Attorney. The Court hoped that by Saturday, to
which time it thought best to adjourn, there would
be an attorney, to prosecute on the part of the State.
Mr. Pitts then handed the presentments to the
clerk, and directed him to enter the plea of "not
guilty" upon the presentments, saying "we will
traverse the presentments, and that course brings
them before your lionor, who has now only to
appoint an attorney to prosecute the case. Be
fore any action was'taken, Mr. Wm. Crane, one of
the Grand Jurors, asked leave to say a few words
before the Court. He remarked that the Grand
Jurors were notall lawyers, and although the pre
sentments may have been somewhat informally
drawn, yet the'majority were honestly of the con
viction that the presentments should be made.
They had no legal advice in drawing the papers,
and on that account they might appear somewhat
vague. He would further remark that the Grand
Jurors had some claim upon the Court and
the State, in any action which they deemed
proper as a body to pursue. They had a right
to the protection ot the Court against any
aspersions of their motives, as made bv the State's
officer on Saturday last. As one of the Grand
Jurors, be would suggest that if the Court could
not find any gentleman to act as their legal adviser
in the matter now under discussion, the Grand
Jury be allowed to select somo gentleman them
selves, for their legal adviser.——Mr. Pitts here
arose and said that the remarks referred to by Mr.
Crane were not madebv the State's officer. Mr.
Whitney here disclaimed any and all intention of
calling in question the action of the Grand Jury,
or in anywise impugning their motives. Mr.
Pinkney had spoken upon his own responsibility,
and not as a State's officer. He (Pitts) himself,
had spoken entirely for Mr. Whitney. Judge
Bond here remarked that the Act of Assembly
gave the power to the Court to appoint an attor
ney, in an emergency such as this, and the Court
now did not feel disposed to give up its constitu
tional right as confered upon it. The Court ex
pected that by Saturday it would receive the ac
ceptance of the appointment from a gentleman
with whose action both the public and the
party accused would be satisfied. It was a
matter of the gravest importance, and it
was necessary that it should be pro
perly, diligently and legally inquired into.
.Mr. Keigbler, foreman of the Grand Jury, here
arose and said that the Court had heard a statement
from the majority side of the body; be now want
ed to make a statement on the other side.—
The minority had desired in this matter
to call upon the Court for legal advice, but
the proposition had been declined by the majority,
and the presentments were drawn without proper
legal consultation. He thought the Court was the
proper source whence any advice should come, and
advocated such consultation. Mr. Eaton said he
knew nothing about the refusal of the body to re
ceive advice from the Court. He, as one of the
majority, did not object to such a course. He acted
with the majority,because he thought that the pub
lie desired a full investigation into the charges
which bad been made against the
accused, and because he thought that bv present
ment the party would have aright to a full investi
gation, by which the public might be satisfied and
the accused might be satisfied. If the papers were
drawn wildly or vaguely, it was perhaps owing to
the fact that the foreman desired to be absent, and
therefore proper opportunity had not been given for
the body to deliberate as it'should have done.
Mr. Miller, Secretary of the Jury, here a>-ose and
said, that at the time the body were deliberating
upon the matter of the presentments, he had pro
posed to invite the Court before the Jury, and ask
counsel oi it, but that the majority would not
accede to his proposition; they had replied that the
Judge should be admitted before them as a witness,
but not as a legal adviser. As soon as Mr. Miller
had made his statement,several jurors arose to their
feet and commenced speaking to the Court and to
Mr. Miller. Mr. Crane said he knew nothing of
such a proposition ns stated. Others wanted to
speak but the Court demanded silence, and re
marked that the proceedings were out of order, and
that the jurors were discussing publicly their delib
erations which they were sworn to "keep secret.
The Court hoped to have the services of a State's
Attorney by Saturday, and would adjourn until
that time Adjourned until Saturday.

IxVITATIOX TO THE NEW YORK SEVENTH RRGIMEXT
TO \ ISIT ENGLAND. —It is stated that an invitation
will probably be received by the Seventh regi
ment, bv the next steamer, through the influence
of Mr. Beliew, the artist, from the London Volun
teers, to visit England. It has been proposed by
Mr. Blancbard Jerrold, captain of a London vol
unteer corps, to raise £25,000 for the purpose of
defraying the expenses, and much interest has been
created concerning the matter among many of the
principal citizens of London. It is thought that
the splendid reception of the Prince of Wales in
this country may have aroused a wish to return
the civility; and the ill-feeling created bv the replv
of Lord Palmerston to the proposal of Company
E. Ninth regiment, of a visit, will be removed.—

SAD CASE OF DROWNING. —On Monday eveniog,
about dusk, Mr. Howard and his son John Howard,
a young man about eighteen years of age, started
from Washington in a small boat, to carry a load
of oysters to Bladensburg. The evening was quite
cold and inclement, and the boat swamped and
sank off' the Penitentiary about dark. The mast of
the little vessel remained above water, and to it
Mr. Howard and his son clung, till admonished by
the increasing darkness, and almost benumbed by
the coldness of the water, the father undertook to
swim ashore and procure help, leaving his son still
elinging to the mast of the vessel. Whether he
reached the shore is not known,but his son believes
lie swam but a short distance and was drowned.—
The steamer Geo. Pago rescued the young man.
A MELANCHOLY END TO AN UNFORTUNATE LIFE.—A
young widow woman, who gare her maiden name
as Catharine Hall, and said she was from New Al
bany, Ind., was killed in attempting to get upon
the New Albany train, at Greencastle, the other
day, after the train was in motion. She said that
she had been to Kansas under promise of mariage,
nnd, being grossly deceived and deserted, she had
started home penniless and alone, stealing rides
until the conductors put her oft', and begging food
at stations until the next train came along. She
had got nearly home, and, having been put off this
train, had run back and caught hold of the rear
car to steal a ride a little further. She welcomed
her death.
POPULATION OF CINCINNATI. —The Cinciuuatians
were dissatisfied with the returns of the census as
taken by the federal officers, and so appointed
canvassers to take another census. The federal
count gave the city a trifle over 160,000 inhabi
tants; the new census makes the number 171,293.
The Commercial says this difference may be readily
accounted for, when we remember that the federal
census was taken at a season of the vear when
thousands are absent, and when this, like every
large city, is depleted more than at any other
time. Jtow, these hundreds have returned, and
are enumerated, and the result is an increase of a
trifle over ten thousand souls.
AN UNFORTUNATE VESSEL. —The schooner Ship
Carpenter, of Dover, Del., was in collision, on the
night ol the 30th ult., with the schooner Shark, off"
Barnegat, N. J., and foundered in a few minutes.
The captain, his wife and the crew, saved them
selves with difficulty, but a child of the captain,
aged two years, was drowned. The same schooner,
when under the command of Capt. W. H. Burrows,
a few years ago, ran down a vessel at sea, aod suit
was brought, which was decided against Captain
Burrows, which so affected him that he has been
ever since a hopeless maniac, in the almshouse of
Kent county.
ct Mulligan was married in the New York
State Prison, on Sunday last, to a Mrs. Mary
Lewis.
TIIIRTV-SI\TII CONGRESS—SECOM) SESSION.
SENATE.
WASHINGTON, Dee. 11. —After prayer and the
reading of the'journal, the House bill to provide
for the payment of all outstanding treasury notes,
and to authorize a loan, etc., was received.
Mr. KICE objected to taking it up. Mr. CAM
ERON favored doing so, and the Senate voted to
take it up—yeas 39, nays 27. The House bill to
authorize the issuing of Treasury notes was re
ceived. Mr. RICE moved its reference to the
Committee of Finance and the Senate so referred it.
The resolution providing for the reference of that
portion ot the President's Message relative to the
affairs of the Confederacy was taken up. Mr.
HALE offered a resolution that the Committee on
Military affairs be instructed to inquire whether the
expenses of lliat branch of the public service cannot
be reduced without detriment to the public safety,
and if they can, that they be further instructed to
report to what extent, and what particular branch
or branches can he dispened with or reduced.
Passed. When the resolution relative to the
secession portion of the President's Message was
taken up, Mr. BIGLER took the floor Irom yester
day, and said: it was my intention yesterday to in
dicate my own position on the great question which
has agitated the people of this country. This is my
only purpose this morning. I shall reserve for
some subsequent period, when I propose to discuss
the question more fully. Sir, it was truly remarked
by the Senator from Mississippi, who sat next to
me on yesterday, that evil times have fallen upon
us. It is too sadly apparent. This great Republic
of ours is in imminent danger of dissolution. The
whole social, political and commercial system is se
riously disordered, and shows unmistakable evi
dence of depression and distress. Commerce, trade
and finances are deranged. The banks have ceased
to redeem their notes in specie, and the treasury of
the United States is unable to meet the enrrent de
mands. A general gloom seems spread over the
entire country. Why is all this, sir? Have the
great element's of prosperity and progress suddenly
been exhausted? No, sir. These were never more
abundant than now. What is it then, sir? Why,
sir, disguise it as we may, this sad picture is the
result of a political panic. I almost shrink from
enunciating the precise cause, obvious to every
Senator and intelligent man in the land. We hear
of Legislatures being assembled, and conventions of
the people being ordered, to consider the great ques
tion whether our relations are to be continued or not.
Is it thus singular that we have Been manifested deep
concern and distress? Sir, this is a sad picture.—
It seems to me that it is the part of patriotism and
duty to look it lair in the face. My own impres
sions at first were, that the less said the better.
I have changed that impression—l believe that
the times require that the public men—the select
men of the nation here should come up to the great
question; let the people understand what view is
taken of it here. For one lam prepared to sepa
rate myself as far as possible from past prejudices
and party allegiance, and consider the condition
of the country in a spirit of devotion to its interests.
I most heartily coimnetd the position of the Sena
tor from Connecticut, without understanding the
desires of the tnen of his own party; he'" has
told it here, regardless of the connection
of his party and prejudices, for I believe
he was a friend of the President elect. He
has come forward boldly and taken his position
for the Constitution, and for the Union as made
by the Constitution ; for the equality of the States
and for justice among his fellow-citizens of the
United States. A Convention of all the States can
be called only when two thirds of the States peti
tion Congress. Every way Congress must have
connection with this subject. We should enquire
calmly, soberly and earnestly of each other what
can be done here. The South has received my co
operation long and cordially. For her rights I
have zealously contended long before on this" Boor,
whose cause has been our cause, and whose cause
to some extent has been embraced by a million and
a half of Northern men. I acknowledge
there has been kept up a war in Congress
upon their feelings'weli calculated to alienate them.
Doctrines are held to some extent inconsistent with
the equality of the States. For example, the ex
clusion of the owners of slaves from the Territo
ries. But is dissolution a remedy? Is that the
best and wisest of all alternatives left? No more
fatal step can be taken for the interest of the great
State I represent here. I remember yesterday the
Senator from Mississippi said that war, and even
death, was to be prefered to dishonor, and that no
State could remain in the Union less than an equal.
Let the South ask redress, and if denied, let two
thirds of the States call a Convention. I will re
sort to any honorable means to save the Union.
I wish to see this Government maintain its digni
ty and influence in the world. It is worth sacrifi
ces, it iscertainlyworth effort. Ifynu want perma
nent peace, you must strike the disease. The
hearts of men must be changed. The most potent
influence to cause any Northern State to put down
the abolition question, and give the South her
rights on that question, is the tariff'. Manufactur
ers and miners believed that the Democratic party
was prejudicial to protection, and therefore have
gone over to the Republican. No man is warranted
in saying that the State of Pennsylvania will ad
here to the doctrines of the Republican party. I
don't believe its issue of Ihe irrepressible conflict,
as generally interpreted in that State. What, be
cause of a party victory, is the country to be
torn by violence, riots and mobs in your
commercial cities, and to derange business?
What, is a party triumph to cause misfortunes
worse than dissolution? I shall do all in my power
to adjust these unhappy differences. I am'dsspon
dent entirely. I can't bring my tnind to contem
teraplate the separation of these States, much less
contemplate the consequences which would follow.
Mr. IVERSON succeeded Mr. Bigler, and said:
I am not willing to vote for the resolution offered
by tlie Senator from Kentucky, neither for Con
gressional legislation, nor amendments to the Con
stitution. In whatever form it mav come I have
no evidence for the accomplishment of anything
good. Look at the question from a common
sense staud-point. Is it designed to frame
Congressional legislation to remedy the evils of the
South ? Is additional legislation necessary to pro
tect the rights and equality of the Southern
States, more than is now presented in the Consti
tution and the lavs? If so what is the Congression
al legislation ? As far as the fugitive slave law is
concerned what more can Congress do than has
beenjdone? If there was a proper public senti
ment prevailing in the Northern States, then the
South would not complain—power is already
given to the Judiciary and Executive to execute
the laws of the government. We don't complain
that the Executive has been derelictin the discharge
of its duties. Fillmore. Pierce, and Buchanan have
carried out the laws. Yet now we do find, at times,
the greatest difficulty in Northern States to reclaim
fugitives, atteaded sometimes with loss of life. It
19 not a defect of the present laws; not the irre
pressible conflict, but a vitiated public sentiment in
the Northern States. In the conservative States-
Pennsylvania and New Jersey—the law is not exe
cuted, and so in every other free State. Why is it
we are put to so much trouble to reclaim our prop
erty there? It is not the defeat of the law, but
public sentiment, that is wrong. When a fugitive
is able to escape to a free State, the courts of jus
tice may try the case, but mob law eventually
takes its place. It is proposed to have Conores
sional legislation and intervention in slave °ter
ritory. Is that the object of the resolution for the
appointment of a committee? No! The great
principle which stands at the very basis, is that the
Black Republicans intend driving slavery from ev
ery inch of Territory. What! They yield to Con
gressional protection? No, sir. How many of the
Northern Democrats, I would inquire, will bo
brought to our support? Sir, yve know, so far as
a portion of the Northern men are concerned, that
they are hostile to the principles we advocate.
As to the resolutions, the means which they set
forth will only add to the burthen of the States, in
stead of giving a blessing. I desire to say a word
to Maryland and Virginia. The District of Colum
bia, especially the people of the District, seem to
be against us. They expect a dissolution of the
Union is going to destroy the capital, and that
property here is to become valueless. Sir, that
may or mav not be. It depends very much on their
conduct. Thatfive States will go out before March
4th, and form a confederacy, is an opinion admit
ting no earthly doubt, and "that other slave States
willjoinona favorable occasion, I have little less
doubt. I will not undertake to discuss the reason—
-1 have expressed it. If Maryland and Virginia
desire to have any influence in the formation of a
new government, to which they must finally owe
allegiance, they had better follow our example and
go out of the Union with us, [laughter,] and so
help to form a government, it may be that a gov
ernment will be formed and State enactments put
in operation before they get time to take part in
it. lhe South will not open the African slave trade.
I believe the great mass of Southern people are
opposed to it. I see no reason yvhy Washington
should not be the capital of the Southern Confedere
cy. [Laughter.] Believe me, it will be true, laugh
as much as they may. [Continued laughter in the
galleries.] Washington will answer just as well as
though the capital yvas in the centre of Georgia.
[Laughter.] For one, lam in favor of making
Washington the seat of Government. [lncreased
laughter.] People may laugh, but thev will not
do so when what 1 say tells in brick and mortar.
Mr. PUGII said he hoped the Union would con
tinue from the extraordinary speech they had just
heard When the people of any State, organi
zation or territory or community, do not
desire to have the institntion of slavery, his right
arm should fall from its socket before he would
vote to force them to accept it. and vice versa. -
Mr. IVERSON said, I referred you to a speech of
February 23 of last year, when I wa3 in the chair.
\ ou did not say "yes" then. [Mr. Iverson referred
to the fugitive slave ease of Burns.] Mr. PUGII
said, that's only one case. Mr. IVERSON read
the Congressional Globe, to prove that Mr. Pughdid
not adhere to what he staled previous to this ses
sion. Mr. PUGH said, let me read the rest.
[Laughter.] I contradict that the fugitive slave
law was trampled under loot. Mr." IVERSON
stated that 20 years ago an eleborate report, made
by order of the Virginia Legislature, proved that
SIOO,OOO worth of slaves were lost from its limits by
being fugitives. Mr. Pugh don't believe that ail
the slave States ever lost SIOO,OOO in this way.
Mr. DOUGLAS.—Like many other laws the Fugi
tive Slave Law is not enforced in every State.
Mr. IVERSON.—If a fugitive is found in a house
one day, the next morning, perhaps, he is run off".
Mr. TEN EYCK said a single instance like that
occurred in New Jersey, where the fugitive
was run oflf. It is the ODLY one instance I
know of as occurring in mv State. Mr.
GREEN.—if a man runs oft' a horse, it's
a pecuniary consideration only, but to steal a
negro is something more. I wish to see a etroDg
arm government, able to discharge its functions.
A govei nment that won't t do it 1 would spit upon;
I would sooner have the despotism of a Louis Na
poleon, and a Prince oi Wales over ine, than a
government that cannot command respect. Mr.
DOUGLAS said no law can be said to be left unex
ecuted, unless it has been brought before a Court
of some sort. Mr. GREEN did not uphold the
sentiment of stealing either horses or negroes.
• Dr. DOUGLAS said he spoke only as to the
non-execution of the laws. Mr. FITCH—I know
in ray State during the last twenty-five years of
but one instance of the rescue of a fugitive slave.
Mr. POWELL—Some time ago a negro ran away
from Kentucky to Illinois,and the Governor of the
latter Commonwealth did not execute his duty.
Mr. WADE said if he recollected right the indict
ment did not show that the party ever was in Ken
tucky.——Mr. POWELL said that the gentleman
evidently was mistaken. Mr. WADE—I don't
know much about it. Mr. POWELL—You had
better investigate facts before drawing the atten
tion of the Senate. Mr. PUGH asked wheth
er the Senator himself was aware of alt
the facts. Mr. POWELL—The Governor was
wrong. Mr. DAVIS said debate on this sub
ject had always resulted in crimination and re
crimination. Mr. MASON said—Our grievances
have been great; we have been humiliated. Mr.
DOUGLAS said—Congress should apply the neces
sary legislation. A Convention of the separate
States to settle this matter was not necessary.
Mr. MASON—We have become satisfied that unless
we hgTe eyidence by a Convention ol the different
States, we are not bound to remain in the Union.
Mr. COLL A.M Kit saia the State Legislatures 1
should aid in establishing fraternal feeling. Mr. 1
YVIGFALL—SIaves have been recognized as proper- (
ty in at least three places in the Constitution. Our
rights have been violated. Mr. DOUGLAS —Be- I
cause rights have been violated, does that justify a
State to leave the Union? Mr.YVIGFALL—The
Senator from Illinois, instead of answering a ques
tion, had propounded another. Mr. DAVIS
cited the biil annulling the legislation of Kansas.
This gave rise to a general interchange of ex
pressions between Mr. Davis, and Messrs. YY'igfall,
Brown and Douglas, pending which, on motion of
Mr. YVIGFALL, the Senate adjourned. The fol
lowing is the vote on the motion to take up the
House Bill, from the last session, to provide for the
payment of the outstanding Treasury notes, to au
thorize a loan, to regulate and fix the duties on
imports, and for other purposes. Members absent:
Messrs. Bright, Chesnut, Clay, Hammond, John

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Mr. COBB, of Alabama, said he did not rise to
make a speech, but to express his anxious desire
that the Select Committee should commence their
business and present their deliberations in some
tangible form. His hope was however faint as to
any useful result. It anything was to be done to
save his State, it must be done at once. The elec
tion of delegates to the State Convention takes
place on the 24th inst., and the Convention meets
on the 7th of January. What mean these crowded
galleries? His answer was the excitement which
pervades the public mind, not only here, but
throughout the country, all looking to Congress to
do something. He hoped the House would stop
thi3 debate and do something, and possibly produce
harmony among the people. There was a pure
gleam oi" light from Boston, which may ultimately
have a good effect on the public mind. Let the
North show a returning sense of justice, and the
questions which now agitate us all be taken into
the hands of the people for proper adjustment. He
trusted the committee would do something to har
monize the distracted public mind. He knew
Alabama would not remain in the Confederacy
longer than the 15th of January unless something
be speedily done. He was not a secessionist. He
desired peace predicated on the principles of the
Constitution. If we could have that, you could
help us to remain in the Union as long as the sun
shall shine; and my prayer shall be sent forth for
the prosperity of this government. Mr. DAVIS,
of Mississippi, briefly gave his reasons why
lie should serve on the committee. He might be
blamed or censured, but in acting where his con
science approved,he defied the opinion of the world.
He stood here not as the representative of his own
preferences but of the interests of his constituents.
He regretted the resolution under which the com
mittee was raised came from a distinguished son ot
Virginia. He had entertained the opinion that the
Southern members should withdraw and leave the
Republicans to submit a report for consideration;
but this could not be done. The Constitution was
sufficient for the protection of Southern rights,
if executed in its letter and spirit. I four Govern
ment rests for its continuance on public opinion, he
could have no hope from that source, or that it
could be preserved by compromises or the use of
the sword. The Republicans have destroyed the
only bond which can bind the Union. The subject
matter for reference to this committee did not be
long to this House. It grew out of principles and
systems in the Northern States directly at war
with the safety and material interests of the South.
If there is any action at all, it should originate
with the States. The House then voted and re
fused to excuse Mr. Hawkins from serving on the
committee. Yeas 95—navs 101. Mr. HAW
KINS, lest silence should be construed into con
sent to serve on the committee, wished to say,
with all deference and good feeling for those who
voted against his request, that he would not
serve. Mr. BOYCE asked that he be ex
cused from serving on the same committee.
Mr. SMITH, objecting, said he expected the op
portunity would have' been presented of exhibiting
the different views of members as a means of influ
encing and acting on the Committee. He was anx
ious to see every State participate in the delibera
tions of theCommittee,and hence he could not excuse
Mr. Hawkins, because if this were done, Florida
would be unrepresented. Mr. BURNETT, in
explanation, said this Government is not to be
saved by mere eulogies on the Union, hut by speedy
action. Mr. SMITH resumed—Nobody expected
to see force used to compel Mr. Hawkins to serve,
or desire to visit him with punishment, other than
that of mere opinion. If the gentleman is re
solved not to serve on tlie Committee, let
him refuse, but not make a request to
be excused, with a private determination not to per
form bis duty. The House refused to excuse
Mr. BoyCe, bv a tie vote. Mr. SMITH, of Vir
ginia, having been informed that Mr. Hawkins sup
posed he had made some insinuations to his preju
dice, disclaimed any such intention, and spoke of
the uprightness and integrity of the gentleman
from Florida. Mr. Hawkins was understood
to be satisfied with the explanation. Mr. MOR
RILL asked to be excused from serving on the
Committee, because of other duties which fully
employ his time.—Mr. JOHN COCHRANE thought
that a gentleman who voted against excusing Mr.
Hawkins and Mr. Boyce, was the last" who
should himself request to be excused from
serving on the Committee. No more serious or im
portant matter could be proposed to the Commit
tee. lie CApl e.-sed bis surprise that a gentlamau
belonging to the Republican party, which had ag
gravated present affairs, should make such a re
quest. Mr. MORRIS (of Illinois) said he had
heretofore voted against excusing gentlemen, but
inasmuch as no action lias been taken in relation to
those who refuse to serve, be saw nothing but con
tempt to the House in forcing them to remain on
the Committee. Mr. STANTON said ho had
voted to excuse Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Bovce, as an
act of courtesy. The gen'leman from Vermont
(Mr. Morrill) has two colleagues, one of whom he
desires to be substituted for himself, and not he
cause he desires to avoid responsibility. He
(Mr. Stanton) trusted gentlemen would give
those on the Republican side the privilege ot
determining when is the proper time (or discussion.
Premature debate can do no good, and especially
as to irrelevant matters. His own course would
be to await the report of the committee. Mr.
SMITH (of Virginia) remarked that only one
side of the House had been heard from. The si
lence of the Republicans is indicative of a stern
determination to avail themselves of the power
they had obtained. Mr. STANTON re
sumed, saying discussion now could do no
practical good, but might resuit in the usual
crimination and recrimination. Therefore he
did not desire to precipitate debate.
Mr. SMITH,of Va., replied, If the Republicans had
met the movement from the Democratic side in the
spirit of kindness, it would have had a pleasant and
agreeable effect on all sides, and in the country at
large. Mr. STANTON confessed he had very
little hope 3 of a successful result from the commit
tee. He did not see what, in the existing state of
things, is to be remedied by legislation. Republi
cans have elected a President, a thiag which had
been done every four years; he did not see in that
anything requiring legislation. If amendments to
the Constitution are to be proposed, he would be
glad to see them. That is the only effectual mode
of doing anything. Mr. HOUSTON appealed
to Mr. Morrill to withdraw his request to be ex
cused. Mr. CORWIN offered a resolution,
which was adopted,authorizing the Select Commit
tee to employ a clerk at four dollars per day, and
that the committee have leave to sit during the
sitting of the House, until they shall report, or be
otherwise discharged. MR. SHERMAN, from
the Committee on Ways and Means, reported the
diplomatic and consular appropriation bills, and a
bill making appropriations for the support of the
Indian Department. Mr. Sherman introduc
ed a resolution, which was adopted, instructing
the committee on Indian Affairs to inquire
and report whether any superintendence of In
dian affairs or Indian agents can be dis
pensed with without public detriment.
Mr. Sherman presented the petition of 'l'haddeus
Hyatt, asking relief for the people of Kansas.
Mr. BOCOCK said the suffering there was not so
great as Hyatt represented, for he had seen in the
newspapers that the people of one part of the Terri
tory had given a hall at two dollars a head.
[Laughter.] Mr. GROW did not know anything
about that, but the I'rcsident in his message had
recommended relief. Mr. GARNETT objected to
the petition, but the House referred it to the Com.
mittee on Territories. Mr. MORRIS (of Illi
nois) made an ineffectual attempt to in
troduce his Union resolutions. The ques
tion on excusing Mr. MORRIS was taKen and
negatived. Mr. HINDMAN wished to propose
amendments to the Constitution. He was opposed
to legislative expedients. Mr. MORRtS(of Illi
nois), objected. Mr. BRANCH offered a resolu
tion, whicli was adopted, that the States to-morrow
be called for bills and resolutions. Those relative
to the state of the Union to be referred to a select
committee. At half-past two o'clock the House
adjourned.
I From the N. Y. Tribune of Tuesday.']
JOHN BROWN PRAYER MEBTINO. —A prayer meet
ing was held last evening in the lecture room of
Dr. Cheever's Church, in commemoration of the
life and death of John Brown. The movers in the
meeting apprehended a riot, and applied to the
Superintendent of Police for protection. But it
was very quiet. There were but 34 persons present
in all. Oliver Johnson occupied the desk and di
rected the exercises. Dr. McCune Smith introduced
a black woman who had made eight visits to the
South and brought back 43 slaves into freedom—
they called her Moses—she was as black as black
could be. Mr. Andrews, of Illinois, could not pray
for a peaceable dissolution of the Union; there was
no hope of it—it must come in blood. A year ago
he lived in the South; he was well acquainted with
slavery; it was too great a sin to be expiated except
in blood. He had told Southern men that he be
lieved that John Brown was a man of God. He had
been surprised to lind the clergy in the South the
most zealous advocates of slavery. These were
perilous times. Slavery would not die in this
country without a final effort to overthrow freedom
of speech and of the press. The meeting was con
tinued until a late hour. One man said that he
had heard a Judge in this city say, "Although I
voted for Lincoln, yet I am no' abolitionist, and I
would head a mob to pull down the Tribune olfice
and Beecher's Church." Most of the speakers
gave details of their personal acquaintance with
John Brown.
SOUTH CAROLINA LEQISLAIURE. —A proposition is
before the South Carolina Legislature to appro
priate $30,000 to aid in deepening the harbor of
Charleston, and 550,G00 to erect buildings to be
used as arsenals and depots for the ordnance, arms
and munitions of the militia of Charleston. There
is also a bill preventing free negroes entering into
mechanical pursuits, or riding in carriages or
other vehicles, unless accompanied by a white per
son. Another bill pending authorizes the Board
of Ordnance to make contract with such respon
sible persons as shall, within the period of fifteen
months' establish and put in operation within the
limits of the State, or any one of the cotton-grow
ing States, an armory capable of turning out ten
thousand stand of small arms, of standard military
patterns, for the delivery to South Carolina of fifty
thousand dollars' worth of small'arms annually for
the term of five years.
AFFAIR OF HONOR. —Messrs. Eugene Cuvellier
and L. A. Haymond had a hostile meeting at four
o'clock on Saturday afternoon, at Hopkins' planta
tion. The weapons used were sharpened foils, and
at the first pass Mr. Cuvellier received a slight
wound in the left breast, while his own weapon
passed through the shirt of Mr. Raymond. The
affair was here stopped by the seconds, who arrang
ed an explanation and reconciliation between the
parties. Both of the gentlemen conducted them
selves with perfect coolness and bravery.— New Or

| THE NATIONAL TROiiBI.ES.
TIIE POSH ION OF TIIE DEMOCRATS OF THE NORTHWEST
ON DISUNION.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11.— The Democrats from the
Northwest nave bad several conferences relative to
the present condition of their political affairs.
They generally take the position set forth in
Messrs McClernand and Vallandinghain's speeches
yesterday, viz: That the Union cannot be dissolv
ed peaceably; that the Northwest will, under no
circumstances, consent to be cut ofi' from the Gulf
of Mexico and the city of New York; that the Gov
ernment,whatever may be its faults, i 3 of inestimable
value. The leading idea is a Central Government,
embracing the Middle, Western and Border slave
States, but depending for its consummation on fu
ture circumstances.
Lieutenant-General Scott will arrive here to
morrow.
STATE CONVENTION OF NEW JERSEY ON THE POLITI
CAL CRISIS.
TRENTON, Dec. 11. —The State Convention called
to consider the present dangers which threaten the
Union, which assembled here to-day, is largely at
tended. Col. Wm. C. Alexander was chosen Pre
sident. Commodore Stockton, chairman of the com
mittee to prepare an address to the people, pre
sented an address with resolutions, both of which
were adopted amidst much confusion.
The address declares that the North has commit
ted great wrongs, and must retrace her steps by the
repeal of all laws preventing the execution of the
fugitive slave-laws, allowing the citizens ol the
Southern States to travel North with their property
The resolutions say, that all the South asks, is
the acknowledgement of her clear constitutional
rights. She looks not for indemnity for the past,
but security for the future.
The following committee was appointed to con
sult and advise with other States : Com. R. F.
Stockton, R. M. Price, Peter D. Vroom, Benjamin
Williamson, Jos. F. Randolph and W. C. Alex
ander.
EXTRA SESSION LOUISIANA LEGISLATURE.
BATON ROCOE, Dec. ll.—The extra session of the
Louisiana Legislature met yesterday. The Gover
nor's Message exhorts calmness and deliberation,
ne recommends the calling of a State Convention,
and says Louisiana ought not to refuse to meet her
sister slaveholding States in council, to demand of
the North the repeal of obnoxious legislation and
guarantees for the future. He says these questions
should be met before the inauguration of Mr. Lin
coln, because the self-respect and honor of the
State does not comport with her remaining under
the administration of a Black Republican Presi
dent.
The members of the Legislature are not disposed
to act hastily, but tbey favor the purchase cf
arms, and preparing for an emergency.
LETTER OF SECRETARY COBB TO THE PEOPLE OF
GEORGIA.
The fact that Mr. Cobb had written a letter ad
dressed to the people of Georgia, has already been
announced. The document has appeared and we
make the following extracts :
After referring to the origin and purposes of the
republican party, lie says :
Can there be a doubt in any intelligent mind that
the object which the black republican party has in
view is the ultimate extinction of slavery" in the
United States? To doubt it is to cast the" imputa
tion of hypocrisy and imbecility upon ttie major
ity of the people of every Northern State who have
stood by this party through all its trials and strug
gles to its ultimate triumph in the election of Lin
coln. I am Fnre that no one can entertain
for them individually or collectively less personal
respect than I do, and yet I do give them
credit for more sincerity and intelligence than
is consistent with the idea that in obtaining
power they will refuse to exercise it for the
only purpose for which they professed to
seek it. Ido believe that with all their meanness
and duplicity they do hate slavery and slaveholders
quite as much as they say they do, and that no ar
gument addressed to their hearts or judgments in
behalf of the constitutional rights of the South
would receive the slightest consideration. What
might be effected by an appeal to their fears or cu
pidity I will Dot now stop to discuss.
He closes as follows:
The facta ati<J considerations which I have en
deavored to bring to your view present the propri
ety of resistance on the part of the South to the
election of Lincoln in a very different light from the
mere question of resisting the election of a President
who haa been chosen in the usual and constitutional
mode. It is not simply that a comparatively ob
scure abolitionist, who hates the institution of
the South, has been elected President, and that
we are asked to live under the administration of a
man who commands neither our respect nor confi
dence; that the South contemplates resistance even
to disunion. Wounded honor might tolerate the
outrage until by another vote of the people the j
nuisance could be abated, but the election of .Mr.
Lincoln involves far higher considerations. It
brings to the South the solemn judgment of a ma
jority of the people of every Northern State, with
a solitary exception, in favor of doctrines and prin
ciples violative of her constitutional rights, humi
liating to her pride, destructive of her equality in
the Union, and fraught with the greatest danger to
the peace and safety of her people. It can be re
garded in no other light than a declaration of the
purpose and intentions of the people of the North
to continue, with the power of the Federal Go
vernment, the war already commenced by the
ten nullifying States of " the North upon the
institution of slavery and the constitutional
rights of the South. To these acts of bad faith
the South has heretofore submitted, though con
stituting ample justification for abandoning a com
pact which bad been wantonly violated. The
question is now presented, whether longer submis
sion to an increasing spirit and power of aggres
sion is compatible either with her honor or her
safety. In my mind there is no room for doubt.
The issue must now be met or forever abandoned.
Equality and safety in the Union are at an end, and
it only remains to be seen whether our manhood is
equal to the task of asserting and maintaining in
dependence out of it. The Union formed by our
fathers was one of equality, justice and frater
nity. On the 4th of March it will be supplanted
by a Union of sectionalism and hatred. The one
was worthy of the support and devotion of freemen,
the other can only continue at the cost of your
honor, your safety and your independence. Is there
no remedy for this state of things hut immediate se
cession? None worthy ofyour conservatism has been
suggested except a recommendation of Mr. Buchan
an, of new constitutional guarantees, or rather the
clear and explicit recognition of those that already
exist. This recommendation is the counsel of a
patriotic statesman. It exhibits an appreciation
of the evils that are upon us, and at the same time
a devotion to the Constitution and its sacred guar
antees. It conforms to the record of Mr. Buchan
an's life on this distracting question—the record of
a pure heart and wise bead. It is the language of
a man whose heart is overwhelmed with a sense of
the great wrong and injustice that has been done to
the minority Bection, mingled with an ardent hope
and desire to preserve that Union to which he has
devoted the energies of a long and patriotic life.—
The difficulty is that there will be no response
to it from those who alone have it in in their
power to act. Black Republicanism is the
ruling sentiment at the North, and by
the election of Lincoln has pronounced in
the most formal and solemn manner against the
principles which are now commended to the coun
try for its safety and preservation. As a matter of
course they will spurn these words of wisdom and
patriotism, as they have before turned their back
upon all the teachings of the good and true men of
the land, or else they will play with us in their in
sidious warfare to delude the South into a false
security, that they may the more effectually rivet
their iron chains, and thereby put resistance in
the future beyond our power. They have tram
pled upon the Constitution of Washington and
Madison, and will prove equally faithless to their
pledges. You ought not, cannot, trust them. It is
not the Constitution and the laws of the United
States which need amendments, but the hearts of
the Northern people. To effect the first would be a
hopeless undertaking, whilst the latter is an im
possibility. If the appeal of the President was
made to brethren of the two sections of the
country, we might hope for a different response.—
Unfortunately, however, Black Republicanism has
buried brotherhood in the same grave with the
Constitution. We are no longer brethren dwelling
together in unity. The ruling spirits of the North
are Black Republicans, and between them and the
people of the South there is no other feeling than
that of bitter and intense hatred. Aliens in heart,
no power on earth can keep them united. Nothing
now holds lis together but the cold formalities of a
broken and violated Constitution. Heaven has
pronounced the decree of divorce, and it will be ac
cepted by the South as the only solution which
gives to her any promise of future peace and safety.
To part with our friends at the North who have
been true and faithful to the Constitution will cause
a pang in every Southern breast, for with them we
could livo for ever peaceably, safely, happily.—
Honor and future security, however, demand the
separation, and in their hearts they will approve,
though they may regret, the act.
Fellow-citizens of Georgia, 1 have endeavored
to place before you the facts of the case in plain
and unimpassioned language, and I should feel
that i had done injustice to mv own connections,
and been unfaithful to you, if I did not in conclu
sion warn you against the dangers of delay, and
impress upon you the hopelessness of any remedy
for these evils short of seaession. Y'ou have to
dCal with a shrewd, heartless and unscrupulous
enemy, who in their extremity may promise any
thing, but in the end will do nothing. Gn the 4th
day of March, IS6I, the Federal government will
pass into the hands of the abolitionists. It will j
then cease to have the claim either upon your con
fidence or your loyalty; and in my honest judg
ment, each "hour that Georgiaremains thereafter' a
member of the Union will be an hour of degrada
tion, to be followed by certain speedy ruin. I en
tertain no doubt either of your right or duty to
secede from the Union. Arouse, then—all your
manhood for the groat work before you| and be
prepared on that day to announce and maintain
vour independence out of the Union, for you will
never again have equality and justice in it? Iden
tified with you in heart, feeling and interest, I re
turn to share in whatever destiny the future has
in store for our State and ourselves.
IMPORTANT MOVEMENT IN NEW TOIIK
The Herald of yesterday says:
A number of our influential merchants assembled
in the Mayor's office yesterday afternoon, and held
a private meeting for the purpose of considering
what action, if anv the city of New ork should
take in view of the present perilous condition of
our national ali'airs. Although the meeting was
preliminary, and the proceedings were principally
confined to snggestion and consultation, there is
reason to believe that the movement contemplated
is of an important character, and when fully ma
tured and announced, may prove ot invaluable ser
vice in restoring harmony ar.d peace to our dis
tracted country. The meeting was strictly private,
so that its proceedings cannot now be publicly made
known.

Now, I, A. 11. Moore, Governor of the State of
Alabama, by virtue of the power vested in me by
the foregoing resolutions, and in obedience thereto,
do hereby proclaim and make known to the people
ot Alabama, that the contingency contemplated in
said preamble and resolutions lias happened in the
election ot Abraham Lincoln to the Presidency of

CRN. DCFF GREEN* TO TIIE PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA
AND NEW JERSEY.
Pending the Presidential election I ventured, in
several letters, addressed to you through the Even
-111 ft Journal, to convince you what the effect of the
election of Mr. Lincoln would be to dissolve the
In ion. Events fince occurring must haveconvinc
ed the most incredulous that my worst fears will bo
realized. The Union will be dissolved. The ques
tion is no longer how to prevent disunion. It is
what States arc to constitute "The United States,"
under the re organization? Permit me to suggest
that "more perfect Union" can be, and probably
will be organized as follows:—The slaveholding
States are content with the Constitution as it now
is, construed as they understand it. They will re
quire guarantees, that such shall bo its construc
tion. Say tli at each of the seceding States adopts
the existing Constitution of the United States, as
the Constitution ot a Union to be formed by the
slaveholding States, uniting with them; that a
Convention ofthese States organize a Government,
adopting the existing laws and Constitution, aqd
that the States thus united, admit other States,
which give them satisfactory guarantees, for the
protection of their rights of persons and property;
such is the issue which I believe will be presented
to you within the next sixty days. The question
lor you to decide is: Will you form part of such a
Union, or will you make war on the South to en
force the dogmas of Seward and Sumner?
THE RICHMOND "wnTG" ON THE CRISIS.
The Richmond Whig, of yesterday, savs:
It is not our purpose at present to enter into any
elaboration of our views in reference to the pending
crisis, but only to hint at them in a very brief
manner. In the first place, then, we are for ex
hausting all rational and honorable expedients for
obtaining a redress of Southern grievances in the
Union, before taking up our hat and walking out
of the Union. To this end we are for a State
Convention —for a Convention of the South
ern States—and for a general Convention of all the
States. And if through the instrumentality of
these various Conventions, we cannot effect an
adjustment ot the differences and difficulties exist
ing between the North and the South, than we are
in lavor, not of secession, but of separation upon fair
and just terms to be arranged by the aforesaid
Convention ot nil the States. In the terms of sepa
ration, if no adjustment C4ll be bad and separation
must come, we shall demand a fair and equitable
division ot all the property of the United States,
including , ot course, the South's just proportion of
the army and navy. If such division of the army
and navy, and of all the public property of the
United States, including likewise the public do
main, should he refused us by the Northern States,
then we shall be in favor neither of jteaceable
secession nor of peaceable separation, but of imme
diate war, and war to the knife, and war to the
"bitter end."
THE MONTGOMERY (ALA.) MAIL ON TnF. PRESIDENT*
MESSAGE.
The Montgomery (Ala.) Jlail of the 7th says:
It grieves us to be compelled to make room for so
much of the Annual Message of President Buchanan
as relates to the interests of the people of the slave
holding States. Our renders will see that he takes
the Northern consolidation view of the Right of
Secession, but "roars us as gently as a sucking
dove," when he comes to speak of "coercion."
It there were no other reason for secession than
the fact that it is thus authoritatively denied, that
fact would amply justify the States about to secede.
The notion that we of the South have become an
integral part of an abolition \ ankee Nation, is in
itself an atrocious outrage, when pronounced by a
man holding the position of a President of Confed
erated States 1
SOCIALISM I.V ARKANSAS. —Some time since, a
community of men and women was established at
Harmony Springs, in Benton comity, Arkansas, for
the avowed promotion of "moral," social, intellec
tual and spiritual happiness." According to a
paper published by the community, some" of its
principal tenets were community of property, a
vegetarian diet, "reform" in the marriage relations,
and a general seeking alter the true, with a cor
responding disregard of the artificial. I)r. J. E.
Spencer and wife stood at the head of the
managing its affairs and exercising a general su
perintendence. Recently, says the St. Louis Re
publican, some members" of the Society became
skeptical of the Doctor's antecedents, and began
an investigation. Among other things, it was as
certained that, the Doctor's "wife" was only an
"affinity," for whom he had deserted his "legal
spouse, and that the virtuous pair had run away
from Rochester, X. V., to escape being mobbed.
The Doctor and his "affinity" got wind of what
was going on, and packing up all the goods belong
ing to the community which they could lay their
hands on, together with all the money in the trea
sury, and the titles of all their estates, suddenly
left, under pretence of being absent a few days.
But the runaways were pursued on horseback,
overtaken and carried back, when they were com
pelled to make restitution of the stolen articles.
They were then suffered to depart. The Doctor
was postmaster at Harmony Springs, and among
fhe deveiopements alluded to was the discovery
that he had been in the habit of opening letters,
reading their contents, and re-sealing them with
paste, being thus able to foretell the arrival of
letters by mail, and what they would contain. Won
derful mystery of spiritual power!
IRON PRATED SHIPS. —Both Franco and England
are building war vessels in armor, and it is time
that our attention were turned to this important
element of strength on the seas. The English say,
as we learn from one of our foreign files, that the
French Gloire is a wooden ship with iron armor
plates, while they claim that their Warrior and
Black Brince are iron ships "with timber intro
duced into certain parts."
One of the most extraordinary things about, these
ships i 3 their great size. The Warrior and Black
Prince are upwards of G,OOO tons each, and their
extreme length more than 400 feet. They arethus,
with the exception of the Great Eastern, the lar
gest ships afloat. They are building in the Clvde.
The Warrior will take, from the beginning, about
nineteen or twenty months to complete it. From
the bottom up to about live feet below the water
line, it is wholly of iron. From this point to the
level of the upper deck, it is fortified by armor
plates, bolted upon blocks of teak. The plates are
4Yi inches thick, and the teak inside 18 inches.
The bulwarks are of wood.
The head and stern are unprotected by iron to
the length of 120 feet, the iron amidships being
300 feet. There are, however, fore and aft, bulk
heads or partitions fortified with the iron plates.
The sills of the main deck ports, as she lies, are
eight feet above the water line. She is expected,
or hoped, to mako fourteen knots, 'l'hedeck ports,
however, have an opening of twelve square feet.
It is necessary, of course, not only to protect the
vessel, but to make her sufficiently light, buoyant
and soa-worthv. The cost i 3 expected to be SI,-
750,000.
NOT WELL POSTED. —The London Time a seems to
feel much regret that Mr. Webster will not be in
Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet, and thinks it a great mis
calculation in the Republican party which has
forced "him and Mr. Everett, and a number of em
inent men of the same party, to ally themselves to
the South, and seek, by concessions to the slave
owning interest, to obtain a position which thev
believed the ."North would never be able to give
them." Mr. Webster has been dead quite eight
years, yet the news has not reached the Time.
AMERICAN SCHOOL ROOKS IN ENGLAND. —It is sta
ted that the "London Board of Education" have
authorized the selection and purchase of a large
majority of our original school books and works
upon education, for the purpose of adapting them
to the use of the national schools of Great Britain.
The result of this move may be the means of im
proving the geographical knowledge of the rising
generation of Englishmen. Some of the members
of the London press might find it of service to look
into some of these work.— Boston Courier.
EDICT AGAINST LYNCHING.— The frequent lynch
ings in Savannah have at last attracted the official
attention of the Mayor and City Council of that
place, who denounce such proceedings as lawless
and subversive of good order and securitv. A
reward of one hundred dollars is ottered for the
apprehension and conviction of parties implicated
in such outrages. The Savannah Republican ap
proves of the proclamation, and says that the
oldest, wisest ami best citizens of Savannah con
demn the course of the vigilance committees.
The supposed murderer of Mrs. Shanks, killed
in New York on Friday morning last, has been ar
rested. He admitted that he was the young car
penter upon whom suspicion had been fixed as the
probable perpetrator of the murder. When asked
to give his name, he gave a different one from that
in possession of the police. This went far toward
confirming the suspicions which were entertained.
The Nashville Banner is authorized to state that
the rumors in circulation as to the otter of a
place to John Bell in Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet are
without the slightest foundation. No intimation
of such intention has been communicated to Mr.
Bell, either by Mr. Lincoln himself or through any
of his friends.
Capt. Wert, who went to Truxillo to get the body
of General Walker, has returned to New Orleans
Avithout accomplishing the object of his errand.—
The old Spanish laAV will not allow a be
removed from Spanish ground until the expira
tion of three rears.
There is some talk of finishing the Hemplield
Road to Greensburc. The work, it is said, is to be
done by the Pennsylvania Railroad, and will be
commenced early next spring.— Pittsburg Journal.
Four lives have been lost in the neighborhood of
Boston, on the skating ponds, this season.
