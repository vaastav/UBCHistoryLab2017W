WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER . 1896.
General Diaz has just altered upon
his fifth term as president of Mexico.
It is estimated that the rebellion in
Cuba has cost Spain so far $500,000,000,
and that she is in such condition that it
is almost impossible for her to secure
money to carry on the war, which takes
312,000,000 a month.
The deficit for the current fiscal year
of the United States government, under
the Cleveland administration has passed
340,000,000 and is still increasing. Re
publicans have managed differently and
will doubtless do so again.
Ex-Oil Inspectob Hilton is having
much trouble in explaining his peculiar
application of plenipotentiary power in
disposing of fees for inspecting gasoline
for the state. This is as much the fault
of the law, which was framed by the
Standard Oil company, as it is of the
officer who misappropriated it. Lin

The Omaha Bee some months ago
printed an article (written by the city
editor, and never Been by Rosewater
until he read it in the Bee,) in which it
was stated that the Herald was on the
verge of bankruptcy. Suit was brought
for libel, and $50,000 damages alleged.
The verdict of the jury was in favor of
the World-Herald, 87,000 damages. The
Bee will appeal to the supreme court
It is only jnst to quote what the Lin
coln Call says in regard to the alleged
danger of the collapse of the present
capital building:
"Such a statement is without the
slightest foundation and could only be
conceived in the mind of imagination.
The present state building is one of the
best in the country, being superior to
those of Colorado, Wisconsin or Mis
souri in every respect, and compares
favorably with the capitol building of
New York, which was erected at a cost
of nearly 320,000,000."
The Nance County Journal says the
name of A. E. Cady of St Paul is men
tioned in connection with the internal
revenue collectorship of Nebraska.
There is no man who could be more
fittingly appointed. A life long and
hard working republican, he has the
confidence of everyone. His defeat for
congress -in the sixth district has not
discomfited him and had it been any
other year he would have won in a walk.
Mr. Cady has hosts of Fullerton friends
who would rejoico at the receipt of the
news of his appointmont
In Coopersville, Michigan, there is
said to be a remarkable case of resump
tion of physical indications of youth in
the person of John Adams, who is now
nearly IX) years old. When he was 80 he
could scarcely sea, was bald and his teeth
were all goue. He can now see as well
as he ever could, has cut several new
teeth and his hair has grown out again.
The new hair is dark brown, his eyes are
clear, and at a first glimpse he looks like
a man of about 40. He now has an idea
that a new skin will come and that his
wrinkles will disappear. He is in excel
lent health and spirits and confidently
believes lie will live a long time yet
COUX SHIPMENT.
A dispatch from San Antonio, Texas,
says: "The rush of corn shipments to
Mexico through here has been the heav
iest ever known during the last three
weeks, and the transferring capacity of
the roads at the border has been taxed
to its fullest capacity. The bulk of corn
comes from Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska,
where it is purchased for 10 cents to 15
cents per bushel, and sold in Mexico as
high as 82 per bushel, Mexican money.
In addition to these shipments by rail,
heavy exportations are being made by
water for the most southern states of
Mexico."
On matters of this kind it is not beet
to jump too hastily at conclusions.
We believe that the price of corn is to
rise because of the increased demand for
export and also as a more or less accep
table substitute for wheat and also, in
some places remote from market, because
of its use for fuel. The fanner who is
out of debt can certainly afford to use
his own store-house the same as he
would an account at bank draw on it
as in need for funds.
WE SECOND THE MOTION.
We need an amendment to the election
law requiring election boards to poet at
the door of polls a complete showing of
the result in the precinct As it is now
in many cases it is impossible to ascer
tain how an election has gone uatil the
official canvass by the Boards of Super
visors. Some precinct boards finish
their count seal up the papers (includ
ing those they should retain, as by law
provided), send them to the clerk and go
borne before it is possible for the press
to ascertain results, except a reporter is
placed in each polling place and kept
there a thing not usual nor to be de
manded of newspapers. But outside of
that consideration the people are entit
led to know the result of the count at
once, and to read it at the polls as soon
as the tallying is finished. Posting the
result at once is also desirable as a pre
ventive of fraud, for instance of altera
tion of the papers after they leave the
hands of the inspectors and judges.
This posting should be protected by
severe penalties for destroying, defacing
or changing the posted sheet It is the
law in several states, and it is one of the
old features or the Australian ballot law
before it was Americanized. Albion

JMF MOVE THE CAPITOL.
Baater That the begislatare Will Discasa
the Saner.
The following is, in full, a special dis
patch to the Omaha World-Herald, under
date of December 1.
The injustice of placing the capitol
near the center of the southeast quarter
of the state has long rankled in the
breasts of the Nebraska patriots outside
of that quarter, and for quite a while
there was at every session of the legisla
ture a movement set on foot for the
removal of the capitol.
Citizens of Lincoln were doubtless
many times called upon for contribu
tions to hold the capitol in place, and
doubtless have spent money, for that
purpose that never was applied at all in
that way, but now, it seems, that the
situation is different The state has
wonderfully increased in population, and
the other three quarters are about to
enforce some claims for recognition in
the way of distribution of favors.
Norfolk statesmen are the only ones in
all the north Platte region who seem to
have been fore-minded enough to butter
their slice of bread for lo these many
years, and it will remain to be seen what
influence.they may now be able to bring
to bear in favor'of their Lincoln ally.
The reason alleged in the dispatch for
the contemplated agitation at this time
is not at all surprising to those who
remember the methods of the Lincoln
patriots of a quarter of a century ago:
The fact that a bill will be introduced
in the next legislature which will provide
for submitting the question of the relo
cation of the state capitol has just come
to light and has caused a sensation, bnt
there is no question that such a bill will
be introduced.
The gentleman who intends presenting
the bill claims that the present state
house will have to be condemned very
soon, and that he is confident that the
majority of the people will, if the ques
tion is submitted, vote for moving the
same to some other point in the state,
and it is believed that Omaha or Colum
bus will be the most likely to win.
The above information comes from a
gentleman who resides in Lincoln, bnt
wishes his name withheld."

WILLIAM STE1NWAY LAID TO REST.
Many Famoa People Pay Tribate to the
Meaiory of the Dead.
New Yobk, Doc. 2. The body of Wil
liam Steinway was laid in the tomb with
impressive ceremonies this afternoon.
Public services were held in Liederkranz
hall, which had never before contained
so many people. A private funeral cere
mony attended only by the family had
previously been held. Massed on each
side of the entrance to the hall were
2,000 employes of the William Steinway
company. Many persons of note and
people of the musical world were pres
ent at the services and great singers lent
their voices to give honor to the memory
of the dead. Mme. Emma Eames-Story
and M. Edouard de Beszke sang solos
and Lillian Blauvelt rendered a requiem,
with the Liederkranz accompanying. At
the close of the ceremonies the Lieder
kranz sang a dirge. Julius Hoffman de
livered an eulogy in German and was
followed by Carl Schurz, who broke
down and wept. The body was placed
in the Steinway mausoleum in Green
wood cemetery.
We agree entirely with the Falls City
Journal in saying that monuments to
the memory of great men in these times
should not be simply piles of stone a
school, a library or a hospital, with an
endowment, would be better.
OBJECTS TO PAYING A ROAD TAX.
Island Hallway Seeks to Restrain
Collection or One Mill Assessment.
Des Moines, la., Dec. 8. The Chi
cago, Bock Island and Pacific Railway
company has begun suit in the district
court against H. C. Mercy, treasurer of
Polk county, to restrain him from col
lecting the 1 mill road tax levied on that
road in all towns in Polk county along
its route.
The case is far-reaching and effects
every taxpayer residing in an incorpo
rated town in Iowa. The railway com
pany claims that the county board of
supervisors has no right to levy a road
tax on city property, as it has no juris
diction over city streets, and is not
obliged to expend money collected on
city streets. If the money is so spent it
is entirely voluntary. The council of
the city has exclusive jurisdiction over
the city streets, and money so collected
has usually been spent on county roads.
The railways have generally refused
this year to pay the tax, and suit has
been begun to test the matter. The
Clinton district court held for the rail
ways and the county did not appeal. So
this suit was started last winter. An
attempt was made to get the legislature
to pass acts legalizing assessment and
collection of this tax, but it failed after
passing the senate.
Involves Title to Iowa Lands.
Washington, Dec. 8. The supreme
court has decided the case of the Rogers
Locomotive works against the American
Emigrant company, involving title to
land in Calhoun county, la. It is a test
case in a series of disputes between
claimants to land in Iowa, and the
swamp land act of 1890 and the grant
which was made to the state in 1856.
The decision was favorable to the loco
motive works which it claimed under
the grant. Justice Harlan delivered the
opinion of the court. The court granted
the motion for a reargument in the
Westinghouse case for the third Mon
day in January after the hearing in
other cases.
Owned Tfconsaads of Acres.
Muscatine, la., Dec. 8. William
Drury of Mercer county, Illinois, a
multimillionaire and the largest land
owner in the United States, died at his
home in New Boston, aged 86. He
leaves no heirs except his widow. He
has been a resident of Mercer county
since 1843. His possessions, outside of
Illinois, are in Nebraska, Colorado and
Texas, about 100 sections of land being
in the latter state. He recently spent
$500,000 in irrigation in Colorado.

Atlantic, Dec. 8. Frank Sherman
of Anita is in jail here, not being able

with criminal assault. His victim,

00HTAINS ARAY0FH0PEF0I0UBA
Warns Spain to I Something- Very Sean.
Turkish Troubles and Veaezaelaa Ques
tion He Kenews Recommendation for
Currency Keforai Would Break the
wadieksChainby Retiring Greenbacks.
Washington, Dec. 7. The following
is the president's annual message as
read to congress today:
To the Congress of the United States:
As representatives of the people in the
legislative branch of their government,
you hate assembled at a time .when the
strength and excellence of our free Insti
tutions and the fitness of our citizens to
enjoy popular rule have been again made
manifest. A political contest, involving
momentous consequences, fraught with
feverish apprehension, and creating ag
gressiveness so Intense astoapprcachhltter
ness and passion, has been waged through
out our land, and determined by the de
cree of free and independent suffrage
without disturbance of our tranquillity or
the least sign of weakness in our national
structure. When we consider these inci
dents and contemplate the peaceful obedi
ence and manly submission which have
succeeded a heated clash of political opin
ions, we discover abundant evidence of a
determination on the part of our country
men to abide by every verdict of the popu
lar will,and to decontrolled stall times by
an abiding faith in the agencies estab
lished for the direction of the affairs of
their government. Thus our people ex
hibit a patriotic disposition, which entitles
them to demand of those who undertake
to make and execute their laws such faith
ful and unselfish service in their behalf as
can only be prompted by a serious appre
ciation of the trust and confidence which
the acceptance of public duty invites.
The TurkUh Troubles.
At the outset of a reference to the more
important matters affecting our relations
with foreign powers, it would afford me
satisfaction if I could assure the congress
that the disturbed condition in Asiatic
Turkey had during the past year assumed
a less hideous and bloody aspect, and that
either as a consequence of the awakening
of tho Turkish government to the demand
of humane civilization, or as the result of
decisive action on the part of the great na
tions having the right bv treaty to inter
fere for the protection of those exposed to
the rage of mad bigotry and cruel fanati
cism, the shocking features of the situa
tion had been mitigated.
Instead, however, of welcoming a soft
ened disposition or protective intervention,
wc have been afflicted by continued and
not unfrequent reports of the wanton de
struction of homes and the bloody butch
ery of men, women and children, made
martyrs to their profession of Christian
faith.
The War In Cuba.
The insurrection in Cuba still continues
with all its perplexities. It is difficult to
perceive that any progress has thus far
been made towards the pacification of the
island, or that the situation of affairs as
depicted in my last annual message has in
the least improved. If Spain still holds
Havana and the seaports and all the con
siderable towns, the insurgents still roam
at will over at least two-thirds of the coun
try. If the determination of Spain to put
down the insurrection seems but to
strengthen with the lapse of time, and is
evinced by her unhesitating devotion of
largely increased military and naval forces
to the task, there is much reason to
believe 'that the insurgents have gained
in point of numbers and character and
resources, and are none the less inflexible
in their resolve not to succumb without
practically securing the great object for
which they took up arms.
It would seem that if Spain should offer
to Culja genuine autonomy, a measure of
home rule which, while preserving the
sovereignty of Spain, would satisfy all
rational requirements of her Spanish sub
jects, there should be no just reason why
the pacification of the island might not be
effected on that basis. Snch a result
would appear to be in the true interest of
all concerned. It would at once stop the
conflict; which is now consuming the re
sources of the island and making It worth
less for whichever party may ultimately
prevail, it wouia Keep intact tne posses
sions of Spain without touching her honor,
which will be consulted rather than im
pugned by the adequate redress of ad
mitted grievances.
Nevertheless realizing that suspicions
and precautions on the part of the weaker
of the two combatants are always natural
and not always unjustifiable being sin
cerely desirous in the interest of both as
well as on its own account that the Cuban
problem should be solved with the least
possible delay it was intimated by this
government to the government of Spain
some months ago that, if a satisfactory
measure of home rule were tendered the
Cuban insurgents, and would be accepted
by them upon a guarantee of Us execu
tion, the United States would endeavor to
find a way not objectionable to Spain of
furnishing such guaranty.
While no definite response to this
Intimation lias yet leen received from
the Spanish government, it is believed to
be not altogether unwelcome, while as al
ready suggested, no reason Is perceived
whyit should not be approved by the in
surgents. Neither party can fail to see
the Importance of early action and both
must realize that to prolong the present
state of things for even u short period, will
add enormously to the time and labor and
expenditure necessary to bring about the
industrial recuperation of the island. It
is therefore fervently hoped on all grounds
that earnest efforts for healing the
breach between Spain and the insurgent
Cubans upon the lines above indicated,
may be at once inaugurated and pushed to
an immediate and successful issue. The
friendly offices of the United States, either
in the manner above outlined, or in any
other way consistent with our constitu
tion and laws, will always be at the dis
posal of either party.
Whatever circumstances may arise, our
policy and our interest would constrain us
to object to the acquisition of the island or
an interference with its control by any
other power.
It should be added that it can not ba
reasonably assumed that the hitherto ex
pectant attitude of the United States will
be indefinitely maintained. While we are
anxious to accord all due respect to the
sovereignty of Spain, we cannot view the
pending conflict in all its features and
properly apprehend our inevitably close
relations to it and its possiblo results,
without considering that by the course of
events we may be drawn into such an un
usual and unprecedented condition, as
will fix a limit to our patient waiting for
Spain to end the contest, either alone and
in her own way, or with our friendly co
operation. When the inability of Spain to deal suc
cessfully with the insurgents has become
manifest, and it is demonstrated that her
sovereignty Is extinct in Cuba for all pur
poses of its rightful existence, and when a
hopeless struggle for Its re-establlahment
has degenerated into a strife which means
nothing more than the useless sacrifice of
human life and the utter destruction of
the very subject matter of the conflict, a
situation will be presented in which our
obligations to the sovereignty of Spain
will be superseded by higher obligations,
which we can hardly hesitate to recognize
and discharge.
Venezuela Boundary Question.
The Venezuela boundary question has
ceased to be a matter of difference between
Great Britain and the United States, their
respective governments having agreed
upon the substantial provisions of a treaty
between Great Britain and Venezuela,
submitting the whole controversy to arbi
tration. The provisions of the treaty are
so eminently just and fair, that the assent
of Venezuela thereto may confidently be
anticipated.
Treasury Department. J
The secretary of the treasury reports
that during the fiscal year ended June SO,
1896, the receipts of the government from
all sources amounted to $109,475,408.78.
During the same period its expenditures
were $134,678,651.48, the excess of ex
penditures over receipts thus amounting
to $25,203,245.70. The ordinary expendi
tures during the year were $4,015,852.21
less than during the preceding fiseal year.
Of the receipts mentioned, there was de
rived from customs the sum of $180,021,
751.67, and from internal revenue $146,830,
615.66. The receipts from customs show
an increase of $7,868,134.22 over those from
the same source for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1895, and the receipts from in
ternal revenuefcn Increase of $3,684,597.91.
The value of our imported dutiable mer
chandise during the last fiscal year was
$369,757,470, and the value of free goods
imported, $409,967,470, being an Increase of
$6,528,675 in the value of dutiable goods
and $41,331,034 in the value of free goods
over the preceding year. Our exports of
merchandise, foreign and domaatio,
amounted in valne to 888,006,88, being
an increase over the preceding year of $75,
068,773. The arersgeadvaloremduty paid
on dutiable goods imported dazing the
vesr wa 39.94 per cent, aad on free and
CqWbit,gooaAKjnu
f he progress in coaiTdefenae Is alluded
to as the one form of military preparation
essentially pacific in its nature. Sum
maries of the reports of the attorney gen
eral and the postmaster general are in
cluded. The postomce deficit due to "car
rying at the nominal rate of one cent a
pound the aerial libraries, sometimes In
cluding trashy and even harmful litera
ture and other matter, which under the
loose interpretation of a, loose statute, has
been gradually given second class rates,"
Is pointed out as an abuse that should be
corrected. An adequate appropriation for
the entertainment of the International pos
tal union in Washington is recommended.
On affairs of the navy and interior depart
ments, there is nothing in the message not
contained in the messages of the secretar
ies. Of the pension commissioner's report
the president says: "In my opinion, based
upon such statements as these and much
other information and observation, the
abuses which have been allowed to creep
into our pension system have done In
calculable harm in demoralizing our peo
ple and undermining good citizenship."
The president urges the importance of
an adjustment of Pacific railroad obliga
tions. Of the case of the Union Paclflche
points out that proceedings to foreclose a
first mortgage upon added parts of the
main line to which the government lien is
subordinate, and the defaults occurring
on January 1, 1897, must emphasize the
mandate of the act of 1887 to foreclose.
Therefore, unless congress shall otherwise
direct, or shall have previously deter
mined upon a different solution of the
problem, there will hurd:y appear to exist
any reason for delaying beyond the date
of the default -above mentioned such ex
ecutive action as will promise to subserve
the public interest and save the govern
ment from the loss threatened by further
Inaction.
The work done by tho agricultural de
partment is especially commended, but
the discontinuance of the gratuitous dis
tribution of seeds is urged. The progress
of civil service for the year is reviewed as
the cause for congratulation. The amend
ment of the interstate commerce' act is
recommended.
Recurring again to the statistics of the
treasury department, the president offers
some suggestions regarding the present
law and its operation. Hesays: This stat
ute took effect on the 28th day of August,
1894. Whatever may be its sbortcoinlngs
as a complete measure of tariff reform, It
must be conceded that it has opened the
way to a freer and greater exohangeof
commodities between us and other coun
tries, and thus furnished a wider market
for our products and manufactures. The
only entire fiscal year during which this
law has been in force ended on theSOth day
of June, 1896. In that year our imports
Increased over those of the previous year
more than $8,500,000, while the value of
the domestic products we exported and
which found markets abroad was nearly
$70,000,000 more than during the preceding
year.
There was,nevertheless,a deficit between
our receipts and expenditures of a little
more than $25,000,000. This, however, was
not unexpected. I believe our pres
ent tariff law, if allowed a fair oppor
tunity, will, in the near future, yield a
revenue which, with reasonable econom
ical expenditures, will overcome all de
ficiencies. In the meantime no deficit tliat
has occurred or may occur need excite or
disturb us.
Currency Reform Urged.
This reference to the condition and pros
pects of our revenues naturally suggests
an allusion to the weakness and vices of
our financial methods. They have been
frequently pressed upon the attention of
congress in previous executive communi
cations, and the inevitable danger of their
continued toleration pointed out. With
out now repeating these details, I cannot
refrain from again earnestly presenting
the necessity of the prompt reform of a
system opposed to every rule of sound
finance and shown by experience to be
fraught with the gravest peril and per
plexity. xSecausc we may be enjoying a tempora
ry relief from its depressing influence
this should not lull us into a false security
nor lead us to forget the suddenness of
past visitations. I am more convinced
than ever that we can have no assured
financial peace and safety until the gov
ernment currency obligations upon which
gold may be demanded from the treasury
are withdrawn from circulation and can
celled. This might be done, as has been
heretofore recommended, but their ex
change for long term bonds bearing a low
rate of interest or by their redemption
with the proceeds of such bonds.
Even If only the United States notes
known as greenbacks were thus retired,
it is possible that the treasury notes Issued
in payment of silver purchases under the
act of July 14, 1890, now paid in gold when
demanded, would not create much disturb
ance as they might from time to time
when received in the treasury by redemp
tion in gold or otherwise, be gradually
and prudently replaced by silver coin.
In default ot this, however, it would bo
a step in the right direction if currency
obligations redeemable in gold, whenever
so redeemed, should be cancelled, instead
of being re-issued. This operation would
be a slow remedy, but it would improve
present conditions.
National banks should redeem their own
notes. They should be allowed to issue
circulation to the par value of bonds de
posited as security for its redemption, and
the tax on their circulation bo reduced to
i of 1 per cent.
In conuluiling this communication, Its
last words shall bo an appeal to the con
gress for the most rigid economy in the
expenditure of the money it holds in trust
for the people. The way to perplexing
extravagance is easy, but a return to fru
gality is difficult. When, however, it is
considered that these who bear the bur
dens of taxation have no guaranty of honeet
care save in tho fidelity of their public
servants the duty of all possible retreacn
ment is plainly manifest. When our differ
ences are forgotten and our contests of
political opinion are no longer remem
bered, nothing in the retrospect of our
public service will be as fortunate and
comforting as the recollection of official
duty well performed and the memory f a
constant devotion to the interests or our
confiding fellow countrymen.
Grovbr Cleveland.
First Appropriation Bill Beported.
Washington, Dec. 8. The first ap
priation bill of the session was finished
by the house committee on appropria
tions yesterday and reported to the
house so that it may be passed this
week. It is the pension bill, which car
ries a total of $141,263,880, a decrease of
$163,004 from the estimates of the com
missioner of pensions. The bill making
appropriations for the legislative, execu
tive and judicial expenses of the govern
ment probably will be reported to the
house this week.
Only Infant Among the McKinley.
Canton, Dec. 8. Mrs. George E.
Morse of San Francisco has returned to
Canton from New York. Mr. Morse
married Miss Ida McKinley, daughter
of the late David McKinley, on the
coast. The charming little daughter,
Majoria, 2 years old, is the only infant
among the McKinley relationship. Mr.
and Mrs. Morse will remain guests at
Mother Nancy Allison McKinley 's home
this week. They will come from San
Francisco to attend the inauguration at
Washington.
Locate Headquarters at Washington.
Chicago, Dec. 8. A Washington spe
cial to the News says: Washington has
been selected as the seat of the Repub
lican national headquarters and H. H.
Handy of Chicago, who did special work
during the late campaign at Chicago,
will be placed in charge of the work
here. The location of the committee's
headquarters was decided on at an in
formal meeting of the national executive
committee.
Lochren Denies a Receiver.
St. Paul, Dec. 8. Judge Lochran has
denied the application for a receiver for
the Yellowstone Park association -in an
action brought by E. E. Perry of St.
Louis against the association, t fee North
ern Pacific Railway company and the
Union Pacific railway. The complain
ant alleged that the Northern Pacific
railroad was manipulating the associa
tion to its interests and against their
interests.

An American PUtbnster Killed.
New York, Deo. 8. A Havana spe
cial to the World says: There is abso
lutely no foundation for the report that
the new trial accorded to the Competi
tor prisoners by the supreme court at
Madrid will be by a civil court. There
hearing will be by ordinary naval court
martial, which means that the evidence
and declarations now being taken be
fore Naval Commissioner Saul, within
the walls of Cabanas castle, will he con
sidered in open court later or at the
arsenal, or such other point as the ad
miralty may direct, by high naval offi
cers especially designated to pass formal
judgment thereon. Public notice was
given a fortnight or more ago, through
the Gazette officials, summoning wit
nesses for the defense to appear before
the naval commissioner and file their
depositions.
One man, George Ferrera, who pre
sented himself, was at once placed under
arrest and charges have since been
brought against him as an accomplice.
This has called forth a new protest from
the American consulate here,' The
most damaging evidence against the
Competitor men as yet obtained by the
prosecution is from Theodore Waze,
himself a member of the expedition, hut
who has declined American protection.
He declared that he was a loyal subject
and turned state's evidence. Admiral
Navarro and Captain General Weyler
have promised to pardon him on condi
tion that he supply them with evidence
to convict his late companions.
Latter Pram Melton.
The World also prints the following
letter from Ona Melton, one of the Com
petitor prisoners, dated Nov. 25. The
letter was smuggled out of the Cabanas
prison: "The Competitor case was con
tinued yesterday, tho 24th. Dr. Cedia,
Captain Laborda and Jorge Ferran were
taken successively to the "Curte de Fan
deras," where they were required to
make deposition on certain portions of
the testimony in the presence of Teodoro
Wasa, the man who was refused the
protection of the United States, claim
ing to be a loyal Spaniard. The depo
sitions were taken by lieutenant Fer
nandez Lopez Sanlt of the navy, judge
instructor. If convenient to you I will
be much obSged to you if you will
make public this move in our
case to the American vice consul,
Mr. Springer, or some one In the con
sulate. Antonio Lopez Colama is to be
shot here in the morning; if so will per
haps know it by the time you get this.
He was brought here yesterday from
Morro castle, with his arms bound and
under close guard. Prisoners are
brought here from Morro castle to be
shot. I have learned from Colonel Ern
esto Jerez Verona, who is one of my
cellmates, that Coloma was the first
leader to raise to arms inMantazas
province hi the war. He left Ibarra
With a small party of men on Feb. 24,
1890, and a few days later was captured.
Martinez Campos would not execute
Ooloma, but now, after 21 months have
passed, Weyler seems to have concluded
to correct Campos' mistake."
Arresting; Students Dally.
London, Dec. 8. A Standard dis
patch from Moscow reports that arrests
of students have continued daily since
the frustrated demonstration in memory
of the terrible Khodinskoe plain disaster
during the coronation festivities last
year. Already 900 students have been
confined in the Ostrong prison. "It is
clear," The Standard dispatch adds,
"that the demonstration is only a pre
text for the agitation of presidential re
forms and the students have the sym
E thy of the people. The government
s ordered an inquiry in the trouble."
Pope Favors French educators.
Paris, Dec. 8. It is stated here that
the pope has decided that the education
of the Catholic clergy shall practically
remain in the hands of the French Sul
picians, whose course of study and dis
cipline he regards as most efficacious in
the struggle against modern worldliness
and in the production of a pure and
zealous priesthood.
Clash of Arms Probable.
Ltma, Peru,, Dec. 8. Observers here
see a probability of another clash of
arms between Peru and Bolivia over the
new trouble which is brewing, owing to
Bolivia having proceeded to fix the
limits of her frontiers in the Amazonian
district without having first made an
arrangement with Peru for the delimit
ation. Insurgent Schooner Captured.

Cleveland, Dec. 8. A novel lawsuit
terminated today in the court of com
mon pleas. On Nov. 5, 1894, Humphrey
Johnson shot and killed his wife, Nellie,
at their home in Collinwood, near here.
Then he committed suicide. Both had
children by former marriages. The ad
ministrator for the wife's children sued
the administrator for the husband's
children for $10,000 damages for the
killing of Mrs. Johnson. The jury
brought in a verdict for $3,000.

Speaker Crisp's Death Announced.
Washington, Dec. 8. When the de
termination was reached to hold a Re
publican caucus today, an mteresting
situation at once presented itself. The
silver Republican senators who bolted
the St. Louis platform and ticket were
an unknown quantity in their political
affiliations and whether or not to invite
them to attend the Republican caucus
was an undecided matter. Many con
ferences were held, Senator Chandler
(N. H. ) being particularly active in rec
ommending that the bolters be notified
of the caucus, which is practically an
invitation to attend. Senator Chandler
took the position that the votes of these
men would be needed in prfng the
tariff bill. Senator Quay it is under
stood took the same view. It was finally
concluded that notices should be sent
them as before. This result placed the
burden of action on the silver Repub
licans. Senator Dubois (Ida.) is, or was, secre
tary of the caucus. He will resign this
place as he has been more active than
the others in the recent campaign and
was one of the most urgent in the advo
cacy of a bolt at St. Louis. There has
been a tendency among some Repub
licans to pursue a conciliatory coarse
toward the silver Republicans and espe
cially, as a number of them have de
clared in favor of protection, and Sen
ator Mantle's paper has been quite posi
tive in this direction. It is not believed
either Senators Pettigrew, Mantle or
Teller will attend the caucus, although
they would not be required to state theix
views. The purpose of the caucus is to
outline a plan for the session.
OPENING SESSION OF CONQRISS.
Beading; of President's Message Waa the
Feature of the Proceedings.
Washington, Dec. 8. The United
States senate began the second session
of the Fifty-fourth congress with
crowded galleries and with that accom
paniment of activity and of greeting
that usually attends the reassembling of
congress. Bat the upper branch of con
gress never puts aside its dignity and
the meeting developed no demonstra
tions or dramatic incidents.
The reading of the president's message
was the feature of the proceedings and
beyond this no attempt was made to em
ter upon the business of the session. To
many of the foreign representatives oc
cupying the diplomatic gallery, the
message had special interest and signifi
cance, owing to the part they had taken
in the conspicuous foreign events to
which the president referred. Sir
Julian Pauncef ote, the British ambassa
dor, and the new Turkish minister,
Moustapha Bay, were present. Senor
DupuydeLome, the Spanish minister,
was not in attendance during the day,
but two of the secretaries of the Spanish
legation carefully noted the references
to the Cuban conflict. Minister Hatch
of Hawaii and Mr. Coopsr.the Hawaiian
minister of foreign affairs, were listen
ers, although the message contained no
reference to the Hawaiian Islands. The
diplomatic gallery was vacated as soon
as the foreign questions referred to in
the message had been read. On the
floor of the senate printed copies of the
message were distributed, and these
gave the senators opportunity to read
the salient features instead of listening
to them. As a result there was scant
attention after the reading had pro
ceeded beyond the first half hour. The
reading of the message covered one hour
and 50 minutes, and at its conclusion
the senate adjourned.
Just as the senate was about to ad
journ Senator Call (Fla.) arose to offer
a resolution, but which he withdrew un
til today. It is a joint resolution, as
follows: Resolved, That United States
of America recognize the republic of
Cuba as a free government and accord
to the people all rights of a sovereign
and independent government in our
ports and within the jurisdiction of the
United States.
Scenes la the House.
Washington, Dec. 8. While the
scenes attending the opening of the
house were both brilliant and interest
ing in the crowds that thronged the
galleries and the conspicuous personages
present, the proceedings themselves
were dull and spiritless, being distinct
ively routine. The house met, the
chaplain invoked the divine blessing on
the work 'of the session, the roll was
called, a ccommittee consisting of Mr.
Cannon (Ills.), Mr. Payne (N. Y.)and
Mr. Turner (Ga.), were appointed to
wait on the president, and the latter's
annual communication was read. The
reading consumed about two hours. It
was Mr. Cleveland's farewell message
and there was much curiosity as to his
views, on Cuba, especially, but there
was no demonstration either of approval
or dissent throught its reading. The
holiday nature of the day was saddened
by the announcement of the death of ex
Speaker Crisp, which Mr. Turner form
ally made to his associates. Out of re
spect to the memory of the distinguished
Georgian, the house, after adopting ap
propriate resolutions, immediately ad
journed. Comments on the Message.
Washington, Dec. 8. Comments in
the senate on the message was generally
favorable to the tenor of the message on
the Cuban question, though there were
some opposing views expressed. A
large number of senators, including a
majority of the members of the commit
tee on foreign relations, excused them
selves from expressing opinions on the
ground that they had not given it care
ful reading.
Plctnre or Cleveland Mutilated.
Chicago, Dec. 8. The picture of
President Cleveland which hung in the
rooms of the Cook County Democratic
club, has been cut to pieces. The per
petrators of the deed are unknown. It
is supposed to be the result of the strife
between the gold and silver wings of
the party, which reached its height at
the annual dub election yesterday. The
picture, which was one of the largest
and finest of the president in existence,
was painted in Buffalo and brought to
the national convention of 188 by the
Buffajk) Democrats, who presented the
portrait to the Cook county Democracy.

OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Intervention In Ca Is Urged by Secre
tary OIney.
Wasjksoto, Deo. 8. For the nrst
sinte within the memory of the oldest
official, the secretary of state has made
a regular report to the president for
transmission to congress liko the reports
of other officers of the cabinet. This
report waa laid before congress today as
an appendix to the president's message.
It treats on many details of oar relations
daring the past year with foreign gov
ernments that either were not touched
apon at all in the message or were more
briefly treated. Under the head of
Spain, Secretary OIney has much to say
in regard to Cuba, and in his report he
sets out in great detail the story of the
growth of the rebellion; the present evil
state of affairs on the island, and other
facts upon which the president bases his
broad 'statement and conclusions. No
reference is made to a report from Con
sul General Lee, bat the secretary
intimates that his information comes
principally from the United States con
sul, and so must be regarded as confi
dential as to its source. The secretary's
estimate of the present situation is dis
closed in the following paragraph made
after a preliminary statement of the de
struction of the industrial resources of
Cuba. "From whatever point of view
we regard the matter it is impossible
not to discern that a state of things ex
ists at our doon alite dangerous to good
relations, destructive of legitimate com
merce, fatal to the internal resources of
Cuba and most vexatious and trying be
cause entailing upon this government
excessive burdens in its domestic admin
istration and in its outward relations.
This situation cannot indefinitely con
tinue without growing still worse, and
the time may not be fur distant when
the United States must seriously con
sider its rights and interests
as well as its internal
duties in view of its peculiar rela
tions to the island do not call for some
decided change in the policy hitherto
pursued." ;
Contesting; a ta.eee.eee win.
Nxw York, Dec. 0. The will of Will
iam Ivison, the publisher, who died last
Hay, leaving an estate valued at nearly
16,000,000 is being contested by a large
number of nephews and nieces to whom
bequests ware not made. The bulk of
the fortune was left to David B. Ivison,
who was named as executor. Mary
Sheridan, a servant, received $10,000.
The contestants allege that Ivison was
mentally incompetent to make a will.
undue influence was used by Mary Sher-
man prior to nis aeasn. lie useato
spread a large number of bis bonds over
the floor of his room and gloat over the
fact that he was getting rich. He often
became hysterical and would throw him
self on the floor and hug his bonds.
Other testimony was offered concerning
Ivison's attachment to Mary Sheridan.
Abandon Investigation of Beef Trast.
Chicago, Dec. 8. Tho federal grand

tion of the alleged beef trust and were
discharged by Judge Grosscup. After
the adjournment some of the jurymen
mid they individually were satisfied
that there was a trust, but that it had
been impossible to reach by subpoena
the witnesses most desired. The pack
ers, on the other hand, deny that there
is a combination or trust and my that
very one waa at his place of business
and could have been reached if wanted.
