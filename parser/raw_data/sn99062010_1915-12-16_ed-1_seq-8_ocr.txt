Ideals of Democracy.
No one who really comprehends the
spirit of the great people for whom we
aro appointed to speak, can fail to per
ceive that their passion is for peace, their
gonius best displayed in the practice of
tho arts of peace. Great democracies are
not belligerent. They do not seek or de
sire war. Their thought is of individual
liberty and of the free labor that sup
ports life and the uncensored thought
that quickens It. Conquest and dominion
are not in our reckoning, or agreeable to
our principles. But just because we de
mand unmolested development and the
undisturbed government of our own lives
upon our own principles, of right and
liberty, we resent from whatever quarter
it may come, the aggression we ourselves
will not practice. We Insist upon security
In prosecuting our self chosen lines of'na
tional development. We do more than
that. We demand It also for others. We
do not confine our enthusiasm for indi
vidual liberty and free national develop
ment to the incidents and movements of
affairs which affect only ourselves. We
feel it wherever there is a people that
tries to walk in these difficult paths of
independence and right. From the first
we have made common cause with all
partisans of liberty on this side the sea,
ana have deemed it as Important that
our neighbors should be free from all
outside domination as that we ourselves
should be have set America aside as a
whole for the uses of Independent nations
and political freemen.

wilii entire confidence.
At least so much by way of prepara
tion for defense seems to me to be abso
lutely Imperative now. We can not do
less.
New Naval Plan.
The program which will be laid before
you by the secretary of the navy is sim
ilarly conceived. It involves only a
hortonin!? of the time within which plans
gram which has heretofore been
only
The program to be laid before you con
templates the construction within five
years of 10 battleships, six battle cruisers.
10 scout cruisers, 00 destroyers, 10
fleet submarines, S5 coast submarines,
four gunboats, one hospital sh:p, two
ammunition ships, two fuel oil ships
and one repair ship. It is proposed
that of this number we shall the
first year provide for the construction
of two batleshlps, two battle cruisers,
three scout cruisers, lo destroyers, five
fleet submarines, 25 coast submarines,
two gunboats, and one hospital ship: the
second year, two batleshlps, one scout
cruiser, 10 destroyers, four fleet subma
rines, 15 coast submarines, one gunboat,
and one fuel oil ship the third year, two
battleships, one battle cruiser, two scout
oruisers, five destroyers, two fleet sub
marines, and 15 coast submarines the
fourth year, two battleships, two battle
cruisers, two scout cruisers, 10 destroyers,
two fleet submarines. 15 coast subma
rines, one ammunition ship, and one fuel
011 ship, and the fifth year, two battle
ships, one battle cruiser, two scout cruis
ers, 10 destroyers, two fleet submarines,
15 coast submarines, one gunboat, one am
muntion ship, and one repair ship.
More Men Needed.
The secretary of the navy is asking also
for the immediate addition to the per
sonnel of the navy of 7.500 sailors, 2,500
apprentice seamen, and 1,500 marines. This
Increase would be sufficient to care for
the ships-which are to be completed with
in the fiscal year 1917, and also for the
number of men which must be put in
training to man the ships which will be
completed early in 1918. It is also neces
sary that the number of midshipmen at
the naval academy at Annapolis should be
increased by at least 300 in order that the
fore® of officers should be more rapidly
added to and authority is asked to ap
point, for engineering duties only, ap
proved graduates of engineering colleges,
and for service in the aviation corps a
certain number of men taken from civil
life.
If this full program should be carried
out we should have built or building in
1921, according to the estimates of sur
vival and standards of classification fol
lowed by the general board of the depart
ment. an effective navy consisting of 27
battleships, of the first line, six battle
cruisers, 25 battleships of the second line,
10 armored cruisers, 13 scout cruisers, five
first class cruisers, three second class
cruisers, 10 third class cruisers, 108 de
stroyers, is fleet submarines, 157 coast
submarines, six monitors. 20 gunboats.
four supply ships, 15 fuel ships, four
transports, three tenders to torpedo ves
sels, eight vessels of special types, and
two ammunition ships. This would be a
navy fitted to our needs and worthy of
our traditions.
U. S. Merchant Marine.
But. armies and Instruments of war are
only part of what has to be considered if
we are to consider the supreme matter of
national
self-sufficiency
and security in
all its aspects. There are other great
matters which will be thrust upon our at
tention whether we will or not. There is,
for example, a very pressing question of
trade and shipping Involved in this great
problem of national adequacy. It Is neces
for many weighty reasons of national ef
ficiency aiid development that we should
have a great merchant marine. The great
merchant fleet we once used to make us
rich, that great body of sturdy sailors
who used to carry our flag Into every sea,
and who were the' pride and often the
bulwark of the nation, we have almost
driven out of existence by Inexcusable
neglect and Indifference and by a hope
lessly blind and provincial policy of so
called economic protection. It is high
time we repaired our mistake and resumed
our commercial independence on the seas.
Why Ships Are Needed.
For it is a question of independence. Tf
other nations go to war or seek to ham
per each other's commerce, our merchants,
it seems, are at their mercy, to do with
as they please. We must use their ships,
and use them as they determine. We
have not ships enough of our own. We
cannot handle our own commerce on the
seas. Our independence is provincial, and
Is only on land and within our own bor
ders. We are not likely to be permitted
to use even the ships of other nations in
rivalry of their own trade, and are with
out means to extend our commerce even
where the doors are wide open and our
goods desired. Such a situation Is not to
be endured. It is of capital Importance
not only that the United States should
be its own carrier on the seas and enjoy
the economic independence which only an
Adequate merchant marine would give it,
but also that the American hemisphere
as a whole should enjoy a like Indepen
dence and self-efficiency, if it is not to be
drawn Into the tangle of European affairs.
Without such Independence the whole
Qetermlnation
til!
uestion of our political unity and self
is very seriously clouded
and complicated Indeed.
Moreover, we can develop no true or ef
fective American policy without ships of
our own—not ships of war, but ships of
peace, carrying goods and carrying much
more creating friendships and rendering
indispensable services to all interests on
this side of the water. They must move
constantly back and forth between the
Americas. Tiiey are the only shuttles
that can weave the delicate fabric of
sympathy, comprehension, confidence, and
mutual dependence In which we wish to
clothe our policy of America for Ameri
cans.
Remove the Obstacles.1
The task of building up an adequate
mercHftnt marine for America private cap
ital must ultimately undertake and
achieve. as it haa undertaken and achieved
every otb^r like task amongst its in the
past, with admirable enterprise,' intelli
gence. and vigor and it seems to me a
manifest dictate of wisdom that We should
promptly remove every legal obstacle that
may stand in the way of this much to oe
desired revival of our old independence
And should facilitate in every possible
Way the building, purchase, and American
'registration' of ships. But capita.1 cannot
accomplish this great task of a sudden.
It must embark upon it by degrees, as the
opportunities of trade develop. Something
-must be done at once done to tipen rputes
Jnd-devejtpp opportunities where they are
as yet undeveloped done to open the
arteries of trade .where the currents have
not yet learned to rii/n—especially between
the two American continents! where they
are, singularly enough yet tb be created
and quickened and ft Is evtlent that
only the government can undertake sua**
beginnings and assume the initial finan
cial risks. .When the risk has passed and
private capital ibegine to find its way in
sufficient abundance Into these new chan
nels. the government may withdraw. But
It cannot omit to begin. It should take
the first steps, and should take them at
once. Our goods must not lie piled up at
our ports and stored upon sidetracks ia
freight cars which ate daily needed on

debates of the two houses, but nowhere

to me very clear that it will be
to
advantage of the country for the. con
gress to adopt a comprehensive plan for
puting the navy upon a final fooling of
strength and efficiency and to pros that
plan to completion within the next five
years. We have always looked to the
navy of the country as our first and chief
line of defense we have always seen it
to be. our manifest course of prudence to
be strong on the seas. Yeaf by year we
luive been creating a navy' which now
ranks very nigh indeed among the navies

the
-Fhere is another matter which seems to
me to be very intimately associated with

?Il,i
tho'r
attitude towards us are miXni-
lestly of the first consequence in the de
velopment of our duties in the world and
a free hand to perform those
duties. must be free from every un
necessary burden or embarrassment: and
there is no better way to be clear of em
barrassment than to fulfil our promises
and promote the interests of those de
pendent on us 'to the utmost. Bills for
the alteration and reform of the govern
ment of the Philippines and for rendering
fuller political justice to the people of
I-orto Kico were submited to the Sixty
third congress. They will be submited
also to you. I need not particularize
their details. You are most of vou al
ready familiar with them. But I do rec
ommend them to your early adoption with
the sincere conviction that there are few
measures you could adopt which would
more serviceably clear the way for the
great policies by which we wish to make
good, now and always, our right to lead
in enterprises of peace and good will and
economic and political freedom.
The plans for the armed forces of the
nation which
I
have outlined, and for the
general policy of adequate preparation
for m&bilization and defense, involve of
course very large additional expenditures
of money—expenditures which will con
siderably exceed the estimated revenues
of the government. It is made my duty
by law, whenever the estimates of expen
diture exceed the estimates of revenue,
to call the attention of tho congress to
the fact and suggest any means of meet
ing the deficiency that it may be wise
or possible for me to suggest. I am ready
to believe that it would be my duty to
do so in any case and I feel particularly
bound to speak of the matter when it ap
pears that the deficiency will pj-ise di
rectly out of the adoption by the congress
of measures which I myself urge it to
adopt. Allow me, therefore, to speak
briefly of the present state of the treas
ury and of the fiscal problems which the
next year will probably disclose.
Problems of Revenue.
On the 13th of June, last, there was an
available balance in the general fund of
the treasury of $1(M, 170,105.78. The total
estimated receipts for the year 1916, on
the assumption that the emergency rev
enue measure passed by the last congresb
will not be extended beyond its present
limit, the 31st of December, 1915, and. that
the present duty of 1 cent per pound on
sugar will be discontinued after the first
of May, 1916, will be $678,365,500. The bal
ance of June last and these estimated rev
enues oome therefore, to a grand total
of $774,535,605.78. The total estimated dis
bursements for the present fiscal year,
including $25,000,000 for the Panama canal,
$}2,000,000 for probable deficiency appro
priations, and $60,000 for miscellaneous
debt redemptions, will be $753,891,000 and
the balance In the general fund of the
treasury will be reduced to $20,644,605.78.
The emergency revenue act, if continued
beyond its present time limitation, would
produce, during the half year then re
maining, about $41,000,000. The duty of
1 cent per pound on sugar, if continued,
would produce during the two months of
the fiscal year remaining after the first
of May, about $15,O®O,0OO. These two sums,
amounting together to $56,000,000, if added
to the revenue of the second half of the
fiscal year, would yield the treasury at
the end of the year an available balance
of $76,644,605.78.
The additional revenues required to
carry out the program of military and
naval preparation of which I have spo
ken, would, as at present estimated, be
for the fiscal year 1917, $93,800,000. Those
figures, taken with the figures for the
present fiscal year which I have already
given, disclose our financial problem for
the year 1917. Assuming that the taxes
imposed by the emergency revenue act
and the present duty on sugar are to be
discontinued, and that the balance at
the close of the present fiscal year will
be only $20,644,605.78, that tbe disburse
ments for the Panama canal will again
be about $25,000,000, and that the addi
tional expenditures for the army and
navy are authorized by the congress, the
deficit in the general fund of the treasury
on the 13th of June, 1917, will be nearly
$235,000,000. To this sum at least $50,000,000
should be added to' represent a safe work
ing balance for the treasury, and $12,000,
mates in 1917 and these additions would
make a total deficit of some $297,000,000. If
the present taxes should be continued
present taxes should be cont.nued
throughout this year and the next, how
ever, there would be a balance in the
treasury of some $76,600,000 at the end ot
the» present fiscal year, and a deficit at
the end of the next year of only some
$50,000,000, or, reckoning in $62,000,000 for
deficiency appropriations and a safe
treasury balance at the end of the year,
a total deficit of some $112,000,000. The
obvious moral of the figures is that it is
a plain counsel of prudence to continue
all of the present taxes or their equiva
lents, and confine ourselves to the prob
lem of providing $112,006,000 of new rev
enue rather than $297,000,000.
Must Pay as We Go.
How shall we obtain the new revenue?
We are frequently reminded that there are
millions of bonds which the treasury is
authorized under existing law to sell to
reimburse the sums paid out of current
revenues for the construction of the Pan
ama canal and it Is true that bonds to
the amount of iapproximately $222,000,000
are now available for that purpose. Prior
to 1913 $134,631,980 of these bonds had actu
ally been sold to recoup tho expenditures
at the isthmus and now constitute a con
siderable item of the public deft. But
for one, do not believe that the people of
th'.s country approve of postponing the
payment of their bills. Borrowing money
is short-sighted finance. It can be justi
fied only when permanent things are to
be accomplished which many generations
will certainly benefit by and which it
seems hardly fair that a single genera
tion should pay for. The objects we are
now proposing to spend money for cannot
to so classified^ except in the sense that
everything wisely done may be said to be
done In the interest of posterity as Well
as in our own. It seems to me a clear dic
tate of prndent statesmanship and frank
finance that in what we are now,, I hope,
about to undertake we should pay as we
go. The people of the country axe en
titled to know just what burdens of tax
ation they ai-e to carry, and to know from
the outsejr, now. The new bills should
be paid by internal taxation.
To what sources, then, shall we turn
This is so peculiarly a question which the
gentlemen of the -House of Representatives
are expected under the constitution to
propose an answer to that you will hardly
expect me to do more than discuss it in
very general terms. We should be follow
ing an almost universal example of mod
ern governments if we were to draw the
greater part or even the whole of the
revenues we need from the income taxes.
By somewhat lowering the present lim
its of exemption and the figure at which
the surtax shall begin to be imposed, and
by increasing, step by step throughout the
present graduation, the surtax Itself, tbe
income taxes aa at present apportioned
would yield sumii sufficient to balance
the books of the treasury at the end o£
the fiscal year 1917 without anywhere mak
ing the burden unreasonably or oppres
sively heavy. The precise reckonings are
fully and accurately set out tn the report
of the secretary of the treasury which will
be immediately laid before you.

have spoken to you today, gentlemen,
upon a single theme, the thorough prepa
ration of tho nation to care for its own
security and to make sure of entire free
dom to play the impartial role in this
hemisphere and in the world which we
nil believ.» to have been providentially as
signed to it. I have had In my mind no
thought of any immediate or particular
danger arising out of our relations with
other nations. We are at peace with all
the nations of the world, and there is rea
son to hope that no question in contro
versy between this and other govern
ments will lead to any serious breach of
amicable relations, grave as some dif
ferences of attitude and policy have been
and may yet turn out to be. I am sorry
to say that the gravest threats against
our national peace and safety have been
uttered within our own
Disloyal Americans.
I wish that it could be said that only
a few men. misled by mistaken senti
ments of allegiance to the governments
under which they were born, had been
guilty of disturbing the self possession
and misrepresenting the temper and prin
ciples of the country during these days
of terrible war, when it would seem that
every man who was truly an American
would instinctively make it his duty and
his pride to keep the scales of judgment
even and prove himself a partisan of no
nation but his own. But it cannot. There

In the United States and calling them

are citizens of the United States, I blush
to admit, born under other flags but wel
comed under our generous naturalization
laws to the full freedom and opportunity
°i ^mer'ca who have poured the poison
of disloyalty Into the very arteries of our
national life who have sought to bring
the authority and good name of our gov
ernment into contempt, to destroy cur In
dustries wherever they thougnt It effec
tive for their vindictive purposes to
strike at them, and to debase our politics
to the uses of foreign intrigue. Their
number is not great as compared with
the whole number of those sturdy hosts
by which our nation has been enriched
in recent generation out of virile foreign
stocks but it is great enough to have
brought deep disgrace upon us and to
have made it necessary that we should
promptly make use of processes of law by
which we may be purged of their corrupt
distempers. America never witnessed
anything like this before. It never
dreamed it possible that men sworn into
its own citizenship, men drawn out of
great free stocks such as supplied some
of the best and strongest elements of that
little, but how heroic, nation that in a
high day of old staked its very life to free
itself from every entanglement that had
darkened the fortunes of the older na
tions and set up a new standard here—
that men of such origins and such free
choices of allegiance would ever turn in
malign reaction against the government
and people who had welcome and nur
tured them and seek to make this proud
country once more a hotbed of European
passion. A litle white ago such a thing
would have seemed incredible. Because
it was Incredible we made no preparation
for It. We would have been almost
ashamed to prepare for It, as If we were
suspicious of ourselves our own comrades
and neighbors. But the ugly and incred
ible thing has actually come about and
we are without adequate federal laws to
deal with it. I urge you to enact such
laws at the earliest possible
moment
feel that In doing so I am urging you to
do nothing less than save the honor and
self respect of the nation. Such crea
tures of passion, disloyalty and anarchy
must be crushed out. They are not many,
but they are infinitely malignant, and the
hand of our power should close over thom
at once. They have formed plots to de
stroy property, they have entered into
conspiracies against the neutrality of the
jovernment, they have sought to pry
nto every confidential transaction of the
government In order to serve Interests
alien to our own. It Is possible to deal
with these things very effectually. I
need not suggest the terms In which they
may be dealt with.

peace and dignity of the United States.
They also preach and practice disloyalty.
No laws, I suppose, can reach corruptions
of the mind and heart but I should not
speak of others without also speaking of
these and expressing the even deeper hu
miliation and scorn which every self pos
sessed and thoughtfully patriotic Ameri
can must feel when he thinks of them
and of the discredit they are dally bring

Domestic Affairs.

the
While we sp^ak of the preparation of
the nation to make sure of her security
and her effective power wo must not fall
into the patent error of supposing that
her real strength comes from armaments
and mere safeguards of written law. It
comes, of course, from her people, their
energy, their success- in their undertak
ings, their free opportunity to use the
natural resources of our great home land
and of the lands outside our continental
borders which look to us for protection,
for encouragement, and for assistance in
their development from the organization
and freedom and vitality of our economic
life. The domestic questions which en
gaged the attention of the last congress^
are more vital to the nation in this its timg
of test than at any other time. We can
not adequately make ready for any trial
of our strength unless we wisely ani'
promptly direct the force of our laws Inti
these all-Important fields of domestic ac,
tlon. A matter which it seems to me wtf
should have very much at heart is the ere
atlon of the right instrumentalities by
which to mobilize our economic resources
in any time of national necessity. I take
it for granted that do hot need your au
thority to call into systematic consultation
with the directing officers of the army
and nfivy men of recognized leadership
and ability from among our citizens who
are thoroughly familiar, for example, with
the transportation facilities of the country
and therefore competent to advise how'
they may be co-ordinated when the need
arises, those who can suggest the best
way in which to bring about prompt co
operation among the manufacturers- .of
the country, should it be necessary, and
those who could assist to bring the tech
nical skill of the country to the aid of the
government in the solution of particular
problems of defense. I only hope that If
I should find it feasible to constitute such
an advisory body the congress, would be
willing to vote the small sum of money
that would be needed to defray the exr
penses that would probably be. necessary
to give it the clerical and administrative
machinery with which to do serviceable
work.
Vocational Education.
What is more important is, that the in
dustries and resources of the country
should be available and ready for mo-,
billzation. It is the more imperii- 5,,
tively necessary, therefore, that we
should promptly devise means for1
doing what we have not yet done
that we should give intelligent fed
eral aid and stimulation to industrial and
vocational education, as we have long
done In the large field of our agricultural
industry that, at the same time that we

-ry instrumentalities of information -con
.tantly at our service so that'we thay
be sure that we know exactly what we
are dealing with when we come to act,
if it should be necessary to aot at all.
We m\lst first certainly know what it is
that we are seeking to adapt ourselves to.
I may ask the privilege of addressing you
more at length on this important matter
a little later in your session.
Transportation Problem.
In the meantime may I make this sug
gestion? The transportation problem Is
an exceedingly serious and pressing one
in tliis country. There has from time to
time of late been reason to fear that our
railroads would not much longer be able
to cope with it successfully, as at present
equipped and coordinated. I suggest that
it would be wise to provide for a commis
sion of inquiry to ascertain by a thorough
canvass of the whole cjuesion whether
our laws as at present framed and ad
ministered are as serviceable as they
might be in the solution of the problem.
It is obviously-a problem that lies at tho
very foundation of our efficiency as a
people. Such an inquiry ought to draw
out every circumstance and opinion
worth' considering and we-* need to know
all sides of the matter if we mean to lo
anything in the field of federal legisla
tion.
No one, I am sure, would -wish to take
any backward step. The regulation of
the railways of the country by federal
commission has had admirable results
and lias fully justified the hopes and ex
pectations of those by whom the policy
of regulation was originally proposed.
The question is not what should we un
do? It is, whether there is anything else
we can do that would supply us with ef
fective means, In the very process of reg
ulation, for bettering the conditions un
der which the railroads are operated and
for making them raore useful servants of
the country as a whole. It seems to me
that it might be the part of wisdom,
therefore, before further legislation in
this field
Is
attempted, to look at the
whole problem of coordination and effi
ciency in the full light of a fresh assess
ment of circumstance and opinion, as a
guide to dealing with the several parts
of it.
For what we nro seeking now, what In
my mind Is
the single thoflght of this
message, is national efficiency and secur-
Ity. We serve a great nation. We should
serve it iu the spirit of its pecular genius.
It is the genius of common men for self
government, industry, justice, liberty ar.a
peace. We should see to it That it lacks
no instrument, no Taoility or vigor of law,
to make it sufficient to play its part with
energy, safety and assured success. In
this we are no partisans but heralds and
prophets of
a
and
new age.
Boots for Russian Troops.
By the end of pctober, the Jiji re
ports, 1,000,000 jairs of boots had been
exported from Japan to Russia, and it
further reports that a contract has
been signed calling for the delivery of
from 50,000 to 100,000 pairs a month
until the cessation of hostilities. Tho
contract price was not made public,
but it is generally assumed to be $425,
000 for 100,000 pairs. Japan's capacity
for the manufacture of boots is such
that it will probably have no difficulty
in filling the order.
The same paper is authority for the
statement that an order for munitions
of war -worth $8,500,000 Ti»s been
placed with an Osaka merchant, but
no details of the nature of the supplies
are given.
Another Japanese paper reports a
war order for 3,500,000 yar(ls af woolen
cloth valued at $5,000,000. It remarks
that a result of this order will be a tre
mendous rise in the price of woolen
cloth because of the domestic require
ments. This is the second large wool
en cloth order from Russia.
