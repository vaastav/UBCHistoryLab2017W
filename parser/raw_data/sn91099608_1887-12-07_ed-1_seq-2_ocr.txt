To the Congress of the United States:

necessities of the people, largely exceeds
the sum necessary to meet the expenses of
the government When we consider that
the theory of our institutions guarantees
to every citizen the full endowment of
the fruits of hie industry and enterprise,
with only such deduction as may be his
share towards the careful and economical
maintenance of the government which
protects him, it Is plain that'the exaction.

our surplus revenues have continued to
accumulate, the excess for "the present
year amounting on the first day of Decem
ber to $55,258,871.19, and estimated to
reach the sum of $118,000,000 on the 30th
of June next, at which date it is expected
that this sum, added to prior accumula
tions, wiU swell the surplus in the treas
ury to $140,000,000. There seems to be
no assurance that, with such a with
drawal from the people's circulating
medium, the business community may
not, in the near future, be subjected to
the same distress which was- quite lately
produced from the same cause. And
while the functions of our national treas
ury should be few and simple, and while
its best oonditlon would be reached, I
believe,- by its entire disconnection with
the private business interests, yet when
by a perversion of its purposes It.idly
holds money uselessly subtracted from
the channels of trade, there seems to be
reason for the claim that legitimate
means should be devised by the gov
ernment to restore in au emergency,
without waste or extravagance, such
money to its place among the people. If
auch an emergency arises, there now ex
ists no clear and undoubted executive
power of relief. Heretofore the re
demption of 8 per cents, only, which
were payable at the option of the govern
ment, has afforded a means for the dis
bursement of the excess of our revenues
but these bonds have been retired and
there are no bonds outstanding, the pay
ment of. which we have the right to in
sist upon. The contribution to the link
ing fund, which furnishes the occasion
for expenditures In the purchase of
bonds, has been already made for tha
current year, so there is no outlet in that
direction. In the present state of legis
lation the only pretense of any existing
executive power to restore, at this time,
any part of our surplus revenues to the
people by its expenditures, consists in
the supposition.that the secretary of the
treasury mey enter the market and
Purchase the Bonds
of the government not yet due, at a rate
of premium agreed upon. The only pro
vision of law from which such a power
could be derived is found in an appropria
tion bill passed a number of years ago,
and It Is subject to the supposition that
it was Intended as temporary, and lim
ited in its application. Instead of confer

suggested that the present
This wrong inflicted upon those who

evil consequences. The public treasury,
which should only exist as a conduit
conveying the people's tribute to the legit
imate objects of its expenditore, has be
come a boarding plaee for money need
lessly withdrawn from the trade and the
people's use, thus crippling our national
energies,' usurping otu- country's devel
opment preventing investment In pro*
ductive enterprises, threatening financial
disturbance and Inviting schemes of pub
lic plunder. Thii^ Condition of our treas
ury is not altogether new it has more
than once of late been submitted to the
people's representatives in the congress,
Who alone can apply the remedy, and yet
the situation still continues with aggra
vated incidents more than ever presaging
financial convulsion and widespread dis
aster. It will not dtf to neglect this sit
nation. Because Its dangers are not now
palpably imminent and apparent, they
exist none the less certainly. On the
80th day of June, 1885, the excess
of revenue over public expenditures,
after complying ,7101 the annujJ re
9&ireTHeUt of the sinking fund act, was
$11,859,785.84 during the year
ended June 80, 1886, such exoess
amounted to 140,405,545.20 and
during the yew ended. June 80, 1887,
it reached the sum of $55,567,810,531.
The annual contributions to the sinking
fund during the three years above speci
fied amounted In the aggregate to $188,
058,890, and deducting from the surplus lolent purpose 6f our government,
as stated weremade by calling in for'. I have deemed It my duty thus to
that pun08e the outetandlng 8 per cent
Bonded Debt Might Be Funded
at a less rate of interest, and the differ
ence between the old and new securities
patd in cash, thus finding use for the
Surplus in the treasury. The success of
this plan, it Is apparent, must be founded
upon the volition of the holders Of 'the
present bonds and its entire certainty
that the Inducement which must be
offered them would result in more finan
cial benefit to the government than the
purchase of bonds, while the latter prop
Mi tiOn would reduce the principal of the
debt by actual payment, instead of ex
tending it. The proposition to
deposit the
money held by the government in banks
throughout the country for UBS by the
people, is, it seems to me, an exceedingly
objectionably principle, as reaching too
close a relationship between the opera
tion of the government to the business
Of the country, and too extensive a com
mingling of their money, thus fostering
an unnatural reliance in private business
upon public funds.* If this scheme
should be adopted it should only be done
as a temporary expedient, to meet an
urgent necessity. Legislative and exec
utive effort should generally be in the
opposite dieection, and should have a
tendency-to divorce as muoh and as far
as can safely be done, the treasury de
partment from private enterprises. Of
course it Is not expected that

will be made for the purpose of avoiding

levied upon importntlo
-^•v-
and Internal revenue taxes 'levied upon
the consumption of tobacco and spintu
OUB and malt liquors. It must be con
sidered that none of these taxes relating
to things subjected to Internal revenue
taxation are, strictly speaking, necessary,
and it so appears to be no just cause of
complaint of the consumers of the arti
cles, and there .seems to be nothing.so
well able to bear the bnrden without
hardship to any portion of the people.
But our present tariff la-ws, the various,
inequitable and illegal source of unneces
sary taxation, ought to be at once re
vised and amended. These laws, aa their
primary and plain effect, raise the price
to consumers of all articles imported and
subjected to duty by precisely tho sum
paid for such duties. Thus the amount
of the duty measures the tax paid by
those who purchase for Use here import
ed articles. Many of these things, how
ever, are raised or manufactured in our
own country. And the duties now lev
ied upon foreign goods and. products are
called protection to these home manu
factures because they render it possible
for those of our people who are manu
facturers to make these taxed articles
and sell them for a price equal
to that demanded for the imported goods
that have customs duty. So it happens
that while comparatively a few use the
Imported articles, millions of our people
who never use and never saw any of the
foreign products, purchase and use things
of the-same kind made in this country,
and pay therefor nearly or quite the same
enhanced price which the duty adds to
the Imported articles.
Those Who Pay Imports
pay the duty charged thereon into the
public treasury. But the majority of
our citizens who buy domestic articles
of the same class pay a sum at least ap
proximately equal to this duty to the
home manufacturers.
This reference to the operation of our
laws is not made by way of instruction,
but in order that we may be constantly
reminded of the manner In which they
impose a burden upon those who consume
domestic products as well as those who
consume Imported articles, and thus
create a tax upOn all our people. It is
now proposed to entirely relieve the
country of this taxation. It must be ex
tensively continued as the source of the
government's Income an in a readjust
ment of our tariff the interest of
American Labor
engaged in manufactures should be care
fully considered, as well as the preserva
tion of our manufactures. It may be
called protection, or by any otherlname,
but the relief from the hardships
and dangers of our present tariff
laws should be devised with especial pre
caution against imperiling the existence
of our manufacturing interest But
this existence should not mean a condi
tion which, without regard to the public
welfare, or a natural exigency, must al
ways insure the realization of the im
mense profits instead of moderately
profitable returns. As the volume and
diversity of our national activities in
crease, new recruits are added to those
who desire a continuation of the advant
ages which they conceive the present
system of tariff taxation directly affords
them.. So stubbornly have all efforts to
reform the present condition
been resisted by those of
our fellow-cltizenB thus engaged,
that there can hardly be complaint
of the suspicion entertained to ascertain
the extent that there exists an organized
combination all along the: line to main
tain their advantage. We are in the
luidst of- centennial celebrations, and
with becoming pride we rejoice in Amer
ican skill and ingenuity, in American
energy and enterprise, and the wonderful
natural advantages and resources de
veloped by the
Century's National Growth,
yet when an attempt is made to justify
a scheme which permits a tax to be laid
upon every consumer in the land for the
benefit of our manufacturers, quite be
yond a reasonable demand for govern
mental regard, it suits the purposes of
manufacturers' infant industries, still
needing the highest and greatest degree
of care that cau be wrung from federal
lecdslation. It is claimed that the in
crease in the price of domestic manufac
tures resulting from- the present tariff,
1b necessary in order that higher wages
may be paid to our worklngmen em
ployed in manufactures than are paid
for so- called pauper labor.
We
acknowl­
edge the force of an argument which-in
volves the welfare and liberal compen
sation of our laboring people.
Our JLabor is Honorable
In the eyes of every American citizen,
and has at the foundation open develop
ment. and is entitled without affectation
or hypocrasy, to the utmost regard. The
standard of our laborers' life should not
be marred by that of another country
less favored, and they are entitled
to their full share of our advantages. By
the last census it is made appear- that
over 17,383,099 of our population were
engaged in all kinds of Industries 7,670,
493 are employed in agriculture 4,074,
-238 in professional and personal service
(2,499,876 of whom are domestic servants
and laborers) while 1,810,256 are em
ployed in trade and transportation and
8,837,112 are classed as employed at man-,
ufacturing and mining. For present pur
poses, however, the latter number should
be considerably reduced^ Without at
tempting to enumerate all, it will be con
ceded that there should be de
ducted from those which it In
cludes 875,143 carpenters and joiners,
285,170 milliners and' dressmakers,,
and seamstresses, 172,126 blacksmiths,
188,756 tailors and tailoresses, 17Q.000
masons, 76,241 butchers, 41,809] bakers,
22,182 plasterers, and 4,801 manufactur
ing agricultural implements, leav
ing 2,62a,089 persons employed in manu-'
factoring Industries claimed to be bene
fited In a high tariff.
To Those tha Appeal Is Made
to save their employment, and malntafn
their wages by resisting a change. There
should be no disposition to answer such
suggestions by the allegations that they
are in a minority among those who la
bor, and therefoie. should forego an ad
vantage in the interest of low prices for
the majority. Their compensation, as
It may be affected by the operations of
tariff laws, should at all times be scru
pulously kept in view, and yet with
slight reflection they will not overlook
the fact that they are consumers with
the rest that they, too, have their own
wants, and those of their families to-sup
ply from their earnings, and that the
prices of the necessaries of life, as well
us the amount of those wants, will regu
late the measures .of their welfare and
comfort. But the reduction of taxation
demanded should be so measured as not
to necessitate or justify either the loss
of employment by the workingman, nor
the lessening of his wages, and the prof
Its still remaining to the manufacturer,
a necessary readjustment should furnish
110 excuse for the sacrifice of the in
terests of his employers in either their
opportunity to work, or the'

and the agriculturist, who manufacture
nothing, but who pay the increased price
which the tariff Imposes upon every ag
ricultural implement, upon all he wears
and upon alt he own.* except the increase
Of his flocks' and herds and such things
as his husbandry produces frotn the soil,
is invited to aid in maintaining the pres
ent situation. Mind, he is told that high
duty on impo ted wool is necessary for
the benefit of those who have sheep to
shear In order that the price of their
wool may be increased. They of course
arc not reminded that the farmer who
has no sheep is by this schcme obliged,
In his purchase of clotliing and woolen
goods, to pay a tribute to his fellow
farmer, as well as to the manufacturer
and merchant nor is any mention made
of the fact that the sheen owners them
selves, and their households, must wear
clothing and use other articles manu
factured from the wool they sell, at tariff
prices, and thus, as consumers, must re
turn their share of this Increased price
to the tradesman. I think
It May Ra Fairly Assumed
that a large proportion of the sheep
owned by the farmers throughout the
country are found in small flocks number
ing from twenty-five to fifty. The duty on
the grade of imported wool which these
sheep yield is 10 cents to each pound
it
of the value of 80 cents or less, and 12
cents if. of the value of more than 8U
cents. If the liberal estimate of six
pounds be allowed for each fleece, th
duty thereon would he sixty or seventv
cents, and this may be taken as th
utmost advancement of its price to the
farmer by reason of this duty. Eighteen
dollars would thus represent the in
creased price of the wool from twenty
five sheep, and $86.00 that from.the wool
of fifty sheep, and at present values this
addition would amount to about one
third of its price. If upon its sale the
farmer receives this 01 a less tariff, profit,
the wool leaves his hands charged with
precisely that sum, which in all. its
change will adhere to it until it reaches
the consumer. When manufactured into
cloth and other goods and material for
use Its cost Is not only -increased to the
extent of the farmer's tariff profit, but a
further sum has been added for the
benefit of the manufacturer under the
operation of other tariff laws. In the
meantime the day arrives when the
farmer finds it nece'ssary to purchase
woolen goods and material to clothe him
self and family for the winter. When he
faces the tradesman for that purpose he
discovers that he is obliged not only to
return in the way of increased prices
his tariff profit 011 the wool
8old, .and which then perhaps lies before
him In manufactured form, but that he
must add a considerable sum thereto to
meet a further increase in the cost caused
by a tariff duty on' the manufacture.
Thus, in the end, he is aroused to the
fact that he has paid upon a moderate
purchase as a result of the tariff scheme,
which, when he sold his wool, seemed BO
profitable an increase in price, more than
sufficient to sweep away all the tariff
profit he received upon the wool he pro
duced and sold. When the number of
farmers engaged in wool raising is com
pared with all the farmers in the coun
try, and the small proportion they bear
to our population is considered when it
is made apparent that, in the case of a
large part of those who own sheep the
lieueflt of the Preseut Tariff'
on wool is illusory, and above all when
It must be conceded that the increase of
the-coat of living caused by such tariff,
becomes a burden upon those with mod
erate means, and the poor, the employed
and unemployed, the sick and well, and
the young and old, and that it consti
tutes a tax which, with relentless grasp,
is fastened upon the clothing of every
man, woman and child in the land, rea
sons are suggested why the removal or
reduction of this duty slionld he included
in a revision of our tariff laws.
In speaking of the increased cost to the
consumer of our homo manufactures re
sulting from a duty laid upon imported
articles of the same description, the fact
is not overlooked that competition
among our domestic producers sometimes
has the effect of keeping the price of
their products below the highest limit al
lowed by such duty. But it is notorious
that this
Competition Is Too Often Strangled
by combination quite prevalent at this
time, and frequently called trusts, which
have for their object the regulation of
the supply and price of commodities
made and sold by members of the
combination, the people cap hardly hope
for any consideration in the operation of
these selfish schemers. If, however. In
the absence of such combination a healthy
and free competition reduces the price of
any particular dutiable' article of some
production below the limit which it
might otherwise reach under our tariff
laws, and if with such reduced price its
manufacture continues to thrive, it Is en
tirely evident that one thing has 1
-een (Un
covered which should be carefully scrutin
ized in our offert to reduce taxation.
The necessity of combination to tualnl..in
the price of any commodity, to the tariff
point, furnishes proof- that some one is
willing to accept lower prices for such
commodity, and that such 1 r'ce* are re
munerative, and lower prices produced
by competition prove the same thing.
Thus, where either of these conditions
exists, a case would seem to be presented
for an
Easy Seduction of Taxation.
The considerations which have been
presented touching our tariff laws are
intended only to enforce an earnest
recommendation that the surplus rev
enues. ot the government be prevented by
the reduction of our custom duties, and
at the same time to emphasize a sugges
tion that in accomplishing this purpose
we may discharge a double duty to our
people by granting to them a measure of
relief from tariff taxation in quarters
Where it is most needed, and from
sources where it can be most fairly and
justly accorded. Nor can the presenta
tion made of such consideration, be, ^vith
any degree of fairness, regarded as evi
dence of unfriendliness toward our man
ufacturing interests, or of any lack of
appreciation of their value and import
ance. These interests constitute a lead
ing and most substantial element of
.Our Rational Greatness,
and furnish the proud proof of our coun
try's progress. But if, in the emergenoy
that cresses upon us, onr manufactures
are asked to surrendeVsomething for the
public good, and to' avfert disaster, their
patriotism aa well as a grateful recogni
tion of advantages already afforded,
should lead them to a-, willing co-opera
tion. No demand is made that they
shall forego all the benefits of govern
mental regard 1 but they oan uot fall to
be admonished of their duty, as well as
their enlightened self-Interest'and safety,
when they are reminded of the fact that
financial panic and collapse to which the
present condition tends, afford no greater
shelter or protection to our manufactures
than to
Our Other Important Kqterprlsep,

Such reduction, or free importation,
would serve beside to largely reduce the
revenue. It is not apparent how
such a change can have any in
jurious effect upon our manufacturers.
On the contrary, it would appear to give
them a better chance in foreign markets
with the manufacturers of other coun
tries who cheapen their wares by free
material. Thus pur people might have
the opportunity 8f. extending their sales
beyond the limits of home consumption,

may involve a slight reduction of the ad
vantages which we award our home pro
ductions, but the entire withdrawal of
such advantages should not be contem
plated The question of free trade is ab
solutely irrelevant, and the persistent
claim made In certain quarters that all
efforts to relieve the people from unjust
and unnecessary taxation are schemes of
so-called free traders, is mischiev
ous, and far removed, from any con

The simp!e and plain duty which we owe
the people is to reduce taxation to tbe
necessary sxpenses of an economical op
eration of the government, and to restore
to the business of tbe country the money
which we hold in the treasury throuah
