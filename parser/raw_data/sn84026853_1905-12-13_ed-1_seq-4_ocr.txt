On Honesty.
Rev. E. B. Kennedy, pastor of the Associate
Reformed Cnurcbln Abbeville, last Sunday
night took for bis subject "Honesty," begin
nn unniai dishonesty of
D1Q| WUU UUUIUIVUV w? WW
speech, where one thing was said when something
else was the truth, and In proceedlog
on hlB way he toufched upon various other
ins of dishonesty. Tbe pollllolan who raised
his head above tbe common level was a
target for the evil minded, while In fact tbe
politician was no doubt aa loniat as others.
In his referenoe to dishonesty In blgb plaoee,
be referred, pmong. other things, to tbe
candal6 in insurance circles which the press
baa recently brought to light. He thought
these corporations held trusts which were
sacred; that the funds of families should be
scrupulously guarded, and be was astonished
.at tbe evidences of unfaithfulness. He
thought, as cburcbmen, as citizens and as
, neighbors the duty of common honesty was
ever present.
Qnnaaiv nf anppoh and honesty of action is
necessary with or among Christians. A
man might be an honest man and not be a
Christian, but be could not be a Christian
and not be an honest man.
Mr. Kennedy has felicity of expression and
wisdom in the selection of subjects. He
preaches the practical or the temporal side
of the holy scriptures wherein man Is taught
duty to his fellow man as well as obligation
to the Author or our being. We must live
I olean lives, and serve Him with ardent seal.
And then, when the end comes, placing our
whole trust and confidence In Him, we may
hopeftlJy lie down in that great sleep which
men. call death.
As Jor the science of theology the wisest
vnnw little and the re-tof us are not especial
ly interested Id speculations about which
ibe preacher himself is ignorant. Mr. Kennedy
does not attempt to lift the veil or u
discover to as the secrets of Him who hJ.
urroanded Himself as with a pavincgr
darkness. The temporal side of tlbj^ (b(^
however, makes It perfectly plain tagr
we should aJ far as possible, se??" M
and pnreness of living. All that, mornw'
Kennedy preaches every S?
and on last Sunday night KjT,?Ji J ?

whole r ??mPanl?s whose oondnct Is
now be.?Vjrev,ewed ot coo?e received Jusl
V ' r'. Itls tbe preacber)s seeming respect
f '?e insurance business at which we are
|r yrlsed. We think that any great corpora
t<<n which teaches the people bow to evade
< .nelr Jost debts, and seeks to Induce the people
to pat their money where creditors oan
t not get it, exercises a demoralizing lnflaenoe(
and lnstllis Into them a principle wblcb is at
arlaocer with tbe objeots and tbe teaching
of tbe preacher's sermon. If tbe insurance
companies bold out tibe Idea tbat It Is honorable
and bonest for tbe policy bolder to take
oat a policy In tbe name of a member of bis
family, Instead of tbe name of bis creditors,
oan tbe act be claimed to be bonest? It sucb
policy is Issued for tbe purpose of defeating
tbe claims of creditors, and If money tbat
should go to pay debts, is spent on life insur*
anoe, is tbe act eltber lawful or bonest ? Tbe
laws of tbe country forbid debtors from dliposlng
of tbelr property in order to evade
tbe payment of tbelr debt*.' If, therefore, a
debtor buys property with tbe money wblcb
should go to tbe payment of bis debts, tbe
courts would declare the contract Illegal and
tbe property would be taken to pay bla debtf.
If an Insolvent debtor tries to enrlob bis
finally at the expense or bis creditors, does
anybody doubt that tbe Courts would do
wltb tbe policy aa It would do wltb property
that Justly belongs to creditors?
l^tt be true tbat tbe companies teacb that
method of defrauding creditors, and area
party to sucb contracts, are not tbe companies
corrupting tbe steams at its very fountain
bead ? If tbe bead officers teacb any
snob doctrine aa tbe cheating of oredltors, Is
i It anrprlalng that they would cheat people
who enter Into contracts against the law ?
A man who expects equity must himself
have cleen bands. If tbe companies connive
at unfair dealing by their customers, Is
it not pretty oertain tbat the judgeous may
be on tbeir guard ?
If. tbe companies enoourage debtors in
cbeatlng their creditors, Is it reasonable to
expect tbe companies to be honest and faithfnl
to their truths T
There may be honest companies, and to
sudb we would exteud our confidence, but
In tbat variety of Insurance companies tbat
teaches dishonesty we have very little confidence,
and should not be surprised If tbey
should steal the money of their dupes.

Good Men, All.
On last Friday tbe Press and Banner bad
the pleasure of greeting Hon. ApguetlneT.
Bmytbet>f Charleston, Hon. Alex C. King of
Atlanta. Ga.,and Mr. tiranvllle Beal of Cat.
tioun Falls. We are always glad to welcome
Into oar office our neighbor and lellow olttsen
Mr. Granville Beal. With Hon. A. T.
Bmy the we have had In the years that are
past the most pleasant business relatione,
and It Is hoped that these profitable relations
mAy oontlnoe for many a day. We know
him so well that we will always want to
know blm. With Hon. Alex C. King we have
had only * abort acquaintance, but we have
no doubt that when we know blm better,
we will And blm to be Just as good a man is
Mr. Bmythe and Mr. Beal. It Is sometlmts
said that a man Is known by the oompany he
keeps. If this be trne, and we believe that It
Is,Mr.King Isagood man Indeed. Weknow
of only one thing In which be Is not quite as
good as bis associates, namely : Mr. King
stsvAa nnt out Hia nHntlner Hnno <rt I ha prAaa
and .Banner office, as do tbe other gentlemen.
We shall expect Mr. King to reform and be
In future quite aa good In every respect aa
Mr. Smythe and Mr. Beale, and this is the
limit?from our viewpoint, at least
Short Word*.
As ft role, we believe, tbat educated men
nee good English words, with fewest syllables.
President Roosevelt In bis recent message
to tbe Congress repeatedly said
"cbftnoe" wben a less oorrect writer might
have nsed tbe longer word, "opportunity," to
express bis meaning.
Mt, Foster Klrby Is at borne on a abort
visit to bis parents. He will not tarry long,
