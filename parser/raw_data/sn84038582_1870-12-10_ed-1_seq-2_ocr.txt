President's Message
Annual Message of tfc President of
the United States to Congress.
Delivered LXonilay, December 5, 1870.
To the Senste nii lions of licprtstfiitatlves : i J Uj
A ye-ir of pence hkq general prosperity to this
nstion has pissod since thi last assembling of
Cout-ress. We have, through u kind Providence,
been b!eed with abundant crops, and have
been spared from complications and WHr with
foreign nttions. In our mil-t., comparative har
mony has be : restored. It is to he regretted,
however, that a free exercise of the elective fran
chie 1'tH, by violonce nnd intimidation, been
denied to citizens in exceptional case iu several
of tfco stites lately in rebelliou, and the verdict
of te peoplo has thereby been reversed. The
gt;itei of Virginia, Mississippi und Texas have
been restored to repreMeututution. in our national
council. Georgia, tho only state nov without
representation, may confidently hH expected to
take her place t.hur also at the begiuuiu of the
nee ye-ir, and then, let us hope, will bo comple
ted the work of reconstruction. With an acqui-e-v-erco
on the prtof the whole people in the
nati mal obligation to pay the puhlio debt created
a the price of our Union, the pensions to our
dualled soldiers and sailors and their widows
Mid orphatis, end in the changes to the constitu
tion which have become neoessiry by the great re
bellion, there is co reason why we should not
advance in material prosperity and hsppiuess as
no other nation ever did after ho protracted and
devastating a wr.
Soon ofter the existfng war broke out in Eu
rope, tbe protection of the United States Minister
in r-ris was invcud in favor of the North Ger
man' domiciled in French territory. Instruc
tions wete issued to grant tha protection. This
has heen followed by an extension of Araerioan
protection to citizens of Saxonv. Ilemin nnd Situ
Coburg Goths, Columbia, Portugal. Uruguay,
tb loniinuvn lepublio, Ecuador, Chili, Para
puny, and Vttiernela, in Paris. The charge was
an onerous one. reauirinur constant and navufa
labor a well as the exercise of prudence and
V m .
good juagment. it lias oeea pertormed to the
entire satisfaction of this government, and. anT
am cffi'iinlly informed, equally so to the satisfac
tion of the government of North Germany. As
soon as 1 learned that a Republic had been pro
claimed at Puris, and that the people of France
bud aenuiesced in the chanfre. the Minister nf
the United Stains was direotod by telegraph to
rocogmzo it Rtn tenaer my congratulations and
those of tho ronlo of the United St:itrs. Tha
re-establishment in France of a system of gov
ernment fiiNconnectoa witu tne aynagtio tradi
tions of Europo appeared to be a proper subject
for the felicitation of Amoriaans. Should tin.
present struma result in attaching the hearts of
tnerrencn to our simpler iorms of representa
tive government, it will be a subjeot. of still
further satisfaction to our people. While we
irTrTke no effort to impose our institutions upon
the inhabitants of other countries, and while we
adhero to on traditional neutrality in civil in
terest elsewhere, wo cannot be indifferent to the
spread of American political ideas iu a great and
highly civilized country like France. We were
asked by the new government to us our good
offices jointly with those ot the European powers
in tho interest of peace. Answer was made that
tho established nolicv and thn trim inturpnts rf
tho United State- forbad-) them to interfere in
European questions jointly w-'.h European pow
ers. 1 ascertained, informally and unofficially,
that the government of North Germany wus not
then disposed to listen to such representations
iron any powers; ana though earnestly wish
iu.T to doe the blessings of peace restored to the
belligciciit-s, with all of whom the United States
are on term of friendship, I declined, on the
part of tli i s government, to tako a step which
would only result in injury to our true interests,
without: advancing the object for which our in
tervention w.t.s invoked. Should tho time come
when tho action of the United States nan hasten
the return of peace by a single hour, that action
will be heartily taken.
I deemed it prudent, in view of ths numlcrof
persons of German t.tid French birth living in
the United States, to issue, soon ofter official
notice of a stato of war had been received from
both tho belligerents, a proclamation, denning
tho duties of tho Un-ted States as a neutral, aud
tho obligations of persons residing within their
territory to observe their laws and the laws of
nations. This proclamation was followed by
othora, as ciroumstanoos seemed to call for them.
The people, thus acquainted, in advance, of their
duties and obligations, have assisted in prevent
ing violations of the neutality of the United
States.
It is not understood that the condition of the
insurrection in Cuba has materially changed
since tho close of the last session of Congress. In:
an early stage of tho contest, the authorities of
Sp-iin inaugurated a system of arbitrary arrests,
and the military trial and execution of persons
suspected of complicity with the insurgents, and
of summary embargo of their properties and a
requisition of their revenues bo exeoutive war
rant. Such proceedings, as far as they affected
the persons or property of citizen of tho United
States, were in violation of the provisions of the
treaty of 1795 between tho United Stutes and
Spain. Representations of injuries resulting to
several persons claiming to be citizens of the
United Stts by reason of such violations, were
mado to tho Spanish government. From April
to Juno last, tho Spanish Minister at Wash
ington had been clothod with a limited power to
act in redrawing 6tich wrongs. That power was
found to bo withdrawn in view, as it was said,
of tho warlike situation in which the island of
Cuba than wns, which, however, did not lead to
u revocation of tho suspension of tho extraordi
nary and arbitrary functions exercised by the
executive power in Cuba, and we were obliged
to mnko our complaint at Madrid. In tho nego
tiations thus opened, and still pending there, the
United States only claimed that for the future
tho rights soeurul to their citizens by treaty
thould be respected in Cuba, and that, as to tho
past, a joint tribunal should be established in
the United States, with full jurisdiction ovt;r all
tuch claims. Hi -fore such an impartial tribunal
inch claimant would be required to prove bis
case. On the other hand, Spain would be at
liberty to traverse every material fact, and thus
compkte equity would 'be done. A esse, which
at one time threatened seriously to affect the re
lations between tho United Statos and Spain,
lias ulreudy been dispoeed of in this way. The
ch.im of the Colonel Lloyd, at Asplnwall, for the
illegal seizure nnd detention of that vessel, was
referred to arbitration by mutual oonscut, and
hasrcjilted in un award to the United States
for the owners of tho same of $19,702.50 in gold.
Another and long ponding claim of a like nature
that of tho whak-ship Canada has been die
posed of by friendly arbitration, during the pres
ent year. It was referred by the joint consent
of Brazil and tho United States to the deoision
of Sir Edward Thornton, llerBriUnnio Majes
ty's Minister at Washington, who kindly under
took the laborious tusk of examiningjthe volum
inous mass of correspondence and testimony sub

mitted bv the two Governments, and awarded to
the United State U esuroof ?10t),70O.O9 in gold,
which hat since been paid by the imperial gov
ernment The recent examples hLow that the
mode which the United States have proposed to
Spain for adjusting the pending claims, is just
and feasible, and that it may be agreed to by
either nation without dishonor. It is to be
hoped that the moderate demand may be acceded
to by Spain without further delay. Should the
peoding negotions unfortunately and unexpected
ly be without result, it will then became mv
duty to communicate that fict to Congress, and
invite its aotion on the subject.
The long deferred Peace Conference between
Spain and the allied South American Rer, uldics
has been inaugurated in Washington under the
auspices of tho Unitod States, l'ursnant ti tho
recommendation contained in tho resolution of
the House of Representatives of the 17th of De
cember, 18GG, the Exeoutive Department of the
Government offered its friendly offices for tho
promotion of peace and harmony between Spain
and the Allied Republics. Hesitations and ob
stacles occurred to the acceptance ot tho offer.
Ultimately, however, a couferrenco was ar
ranged, and was opened in this city on the 29th
of October last, at which I authorised the Secre
tary of 8tate to preside. It was attended by
the Ministers of Spain, Puru, Chili and Ecuador.
In consequence of tho absence of a representa
tive from Bolivia, the conference was adjourned,
until the attendance of a Plenipotentiary from
that Republic could be secured, or other meas
ures could be adopted toward compassing its ob
ject. The allied and other Republics of Spanish
origin on this continent may sto in this f.ict a
B3W proof of our sin :tro interest iu their wel
fare; of eur desire to nee them blessed with
good Governments, capable of maintaining or
der and preserving their respective territorial
integrity, and of our sincere wish to extend our
commercial and social relations with them. The
time is not probably far distant when, in tho
oourse of events, the European political connec
tion with this oontinent will ce:io. Our policy
should be shaped in view of this probability, so
as to ally the oomruerci.tl interests of the Spanish-American
states more closely to our own,
and thus pive the United States all the pre-eminence
and all the advantage which Mr. Monroe,
Mr. Adams and Mr. Clay contemplated, when
they proposed to join the Congress of Panama.
During the last session of Congress a treaty
for the annexation of the Republic of San Do
mingo to the United States failed to receive the
requisite two-thirds vote of the Senate. I was
thoroughly oonvinced then that the best inter
ests of the conntry, commercially and material
ly, demand its ratification. Time has only con
firmed me in this view. I now firmly believe
that the moment it is known that the United
States have entirely abandoned the project of ac
cepting, as a part of its territory, tho Island of
Sn Domingo, a free port will be negotiated for
by European nations in the bay ot Samana. A
large commercial city will sprug up, to
which we Will be tributary, without receiving
corresponding benefits. The Government of
Sun Domingo has voluntarily sought tbo annex
ation. It is a weak powur, numbering probably
less than one hundred and twentv thousand
souls, and yet possessing one of the richest local
ities under the sun, caoable of supporting a pop
ulation of 10,0(O,0U0 of people in luxury. The
people of S.n Domingo are not capable of main
tainingjthemselves in their present eondition.and
must look for outside support They yearn for the
proteetion of our free institutions and laws, our
progrss and civilization. Shall we reiuse them ?
The acquisition of San Domingo is desirable,
becauso of its geographical position It com
mands the entrance to the Cirribem Sea and
the Isthmus trans-it to coiumeree. It possesses
the riche-t soil, best and most ctiptcious harbors,
the most salubrious clir.nto, and the mot valu
able products of the forest, mine and soil of any
of the West India islands. Its possesion by the
United States will in a few years build up a
coastwise commeroe of immense magnitude,
which will go far towards restoring rb.the Unit
ed States our lost merchant marine. It will
give to us those articles which we consider of
great value and do not produce, thus equalizing
our exports and imports. In case of u foreign
war it will give us command of all the islands
referred to, and thus prevent an enemy from
again possessing himself of a rendezvous upon
our roast. Our gulf trade etwi-en tho st.ites
bordering ou the Atlantic and those bordering
on the Gulf of Mexico is by the Bihamas and
the Antilles. Twice wu must, us it wero, pass
through foreign countries to get from Georgia
to the east coast of Florida. San Domingo,
with a stable government, under which her im
mense resources can be developed, will give re
munerative wages to 10,000 of laborers not now
upon the island. This labor will take advan
tage of every available means of transportation
to abandon the ejacent islands, and seek the
blessings of its freedom, and its sequenco is that
eaoh inhabitant will receive the reward of his
own labor. Torto Rico and Cub will have to
abolish slavery as a measure of self-preservation
to retain their laborers. San Domingo will be
oome a large consumer of the products of north
ern farms and manufactories. The che.ip rate
at whioh her citizens cjii bo furnished with
food, tools, land and machinery, will nuke nec
essary that the contiguous islands should have
the same advantages in order to compete with
the pioduction of sugar, coffee, tobacco, tropical
fruit, etc This will opou to us a wider market
for our products. The production of our supply
of theso articles will cut oil more than one hun
dred millions of our unnu il imports. With sueh
a picture, it is easy to see how our large debt
abroad is to bo ultimately extinguished. With
a balanoe of trado against ns, including interest
ef bonds held by foreigners, and money shipment
of our citizens traveling in foreign lands,
eqtfal to the yield of precious metals in this
country, it is not so easy to see how this result
is to be otherwise accomplished. The acquisition
of San Domingo is an adhesion to the Monroe
dootrine as a measure of nutionul protection. It
is asserting our right to a controlling influence
over ,the great commercial traffic soon to flow
from tho west to tho oast, by the way of the Isth
mus of Darien. It is to build up our merchant
marine. It is to furnish new markets for tho
roducts of our farms, shops, and manufacturers,
t is to make slavery unsupportahle in Cuba and
Porto Rico at once, ultimately so in Brizil. It
is to settle the unhappy condition of Cuba, and
ond an exterminating conllict. It is to provido
honest means of paying our honest debts without
overtaxing the people. It is to furnish our citi
zens with the necessaries of cvery-day life at
cneaper rates tnan ever brture, and it is, in fine,
a rapid stride towards that greatness which the
intelligence, industry and onternriso of the citi
zens of the United States entitle this country to
among tho nations. Iu view of the importance
of this question, I earnestly urge upon congress
early action expressive of its viows us to the bast
means of aoquiriugQSan Domingo. My tmpgest
ion is, that by a joint resolution of the two
Houses of Congress the exeoutive bo authorized
to appoint a commission to negotiate for a treaty

tion bo made to defray the expenses of such com
mission. Tho question may be determined by
the aotion of the two houses of congress, upon a
resolution of annexation, us in tho case of the no-
quldtion of Texas. I am so convinced of all of
the advantages to flow, from the acquisition of
Baa Domingo, and of the great disadvantages, 1
might almost say calamities, to flow from Its not
acquisition, that I believe the subject has only to
do invasiigiiioa to to approved.
It Is to bo regretted that our representation
in regard to the injurious effects, especially upon
the revenue of the United States, of the policy
of the Mexican Government in exempting from
import duties a larsre tract of its territory on
our borders, have not only been fruitless, bat
that it is even proposed in that country to ex
tend the limits within whioh the privilege ad
verted to has hitherto been enioved. The exne-
diency of taking into your serious consideration
we proper means for countervailing tne policy
referred to will, it is presumed, engage yonr ear
nest attention. It is the obvious interest, espe
cially of neighboring nations, to provide against
injury to those who may have committed, high
crimes within their borders, and who may have
sought refuge abroad. For this purpose extradi
tion treaties have been concluded with several of
the Central American Republics, and others are
in progress. The sense of congress is desired as
early as may be convenient upon the proceed
ings of the Commission on Claims against Ven
ezuela, whioh are communioated in the messages
of March 1, 1SG9, Maroh 1, 1S70, and March 31,
loiO. It has not been deemed advisable to dis
tribute any of the money which has been re
ceived from that government until congress shall
Have acted upon the subject
The mssacrea of French and Russian resi
dents at Tien-Tsin, under oironmstanoea of great
barbarity, were supposed by some to have been
premeditated, and .to indicate a purpose among
the populace to exterminate foreigners in the
Chinese Empire. Tne evidence fails to establish
such a supposition, but shows a complioitv bv
the local authorities and the mob. The govern-1
went at Pekin, however, seems to have been dis- I
j ii-ii . . . ... . . ..i
luru io -minu irs treaty oDiigauons so far as it
was able to do so. Unfortunately, the news of
the war between the German States and France
reached China soon after the massaore. It would
appear that the popular mind beoame possessed
with tho ida that this contest, extending to tne
Chinese waters, would neutralize the Christian
influence and power, and that the time was com
ing when the superstitions mass might expel all
foreigners aud restore the Mandarin influence.
Anticipating trouble from this eause, I invited
France and North Germany to make an author
ized suspension of hostilities in the east, where
they were temporarily suspended by act of the
commanders, to aot together for the future pro
tection in China of the lives and property of
Americans and Europeans.
Since the adjournment of congress the ratlfl
tions of the treaty with Great Britain for abol
ishing the mixed courts for the suppression of
the slave trade have been exchanged. It is be
lieved that the slave trade is now confined to the
eastern coast of Afrioa, whence the alaves are
taken to Am' ian markets.
The ratifications of ths Naturalization Con
vention between Great Britain and the United
States have also been exchanged during the re
cess, and thus a long-standing dispute between
the two governments has been settled in accord
ance with the principles always contended for
by the Unitod States.
In April last, while engaged in locating a mil
itary reservation near Pembina, a corps of engi
neers discovered that the commonly received
boundary line between the United States and
the British possessions at that plaos is about
fifty-seven hundred feet south of the true posi
tion of the zenith parallel, and that the line,
when run on what is now supposed to bo the
true position of that parallel, would leave the
fort of the Hudson's Bay Company, at Pemhiaar
within the territory of the United States. This
information being communioated to the British
government, I was requested to consent and I
did consent that the British occupation of the
fort of the Hudson's Bay Company should con
tinue for the present. I deem it important,
however,; that tnis ptrt of the boundary line
should be definitely fixed by a joint commission
of the governments, and submit herewith esti
mates of tho expense of such a commission on
the part of the United States, and recommend
an appropriation for that purpose. The land
boundary is already fixed and marked from the
summit of the Rocky Mountains to the Georgian
Bay. It should now be, iu like manner, marked
from the Lake of the Woods to the summit of
the Rocky Mountains.
I regret to say that no eonclusion has been
reached for the adjustment of the claims against
Gre.it Britaiu, growiuit out of the course adopted
by that government during the rebellion. The
Cabinet of London, so far as its views have been
expressed, does not oppear to be willing to con
cede that Her Majesty's Government was guilty
of n ifligence, or did or permitted any act dur
ing the war by which tha United States has just
cause of complaint. Our firm and unalterable
convictions are directly the reverse. I therefore
recommend to conirrest to authorize the appoint
ment of a commission to take proof of the
amounts, and the ownership, acd their claims,
on notice to the representative of Her Majesty
at Washington, and that authority be given for
the settlement of these claims by the United
States, so that the government shall have the
ownership of the private claims, as well as the
responsible control of all the demands against
Great Britaiu. It cannot be necessary to add
that whenever Her Majasty's Government shall
entertain a desire for a full and friendly adjust
ment of these claims, the United States will en
ter upon their consideration with an earnest de
sire for a conclusion consistent with the honor
and dignity of both nations.
The course pursued by the Canadian author
ities toward the fishermen of tho United States
during the past season has not been marked by a
friendly feeling;. By the first article of the
Convention of 1818, between Great Britain
fim 1 the United Slates, it was agreed that the
inhabitants of Ihe United States should have
forever in common with British subjects the
riget of takini; fish in certain wiitm therein
delined. In the waters not included in the
limits named in the convention, within three
mill's of ports of the British coast, it has bech
the custom for many years to give intruding
fishermen of the United Stutes a reasonable
warning of the violation of the technical lights
of (1 rent Britain. The imperial Government
is understood to have delegated the whole or
a share of its jurisdiction or control ef these
in-phore grounds to tho Dominion ef Canadu,
and this senii-indcpcmleut but irresponsible
agent has exercised its delegated powers in an
unfriendly way. ; Vessels have been seized
without notice or warning in violation of the
custom previously . prevailing, and have been
taken into the colonial ports, their voyages
broken up, nnd the vessels condemned. There
is rcnon to believe that this unfriendly and
vexatious trentnieut was designed to bear
liuishly upon the hardy fishermen of the
Utiitetl States, with u viow of political effect
upon this Government. The Btatutes of the
Dominion of Canada assume a still broader
nnd more untenable jurisdiction over vessels
of the United States. They authorized officers
or persons to bring vessels hovering within
three marine miles of uny of the coasts, bays,
creeks or harbors of Canada into port, to
seurch the cargo, to examine the master on
oath touching tho cargo and vovacre. and to
S : .. : ..4 . i t ... i , .. ...
iiiiuot upon uiui it iit-uvy pecuniary penalty it
true answers are not given, ana it such a
vessel is found preparing to fish within threo
murine miles of any such coasts, bays, creeks,
or harbors without a license, or after the expi
ration of the period named in the last license
granted to it, they provide that the vessel,
with her tackle, etc., shall be forfeited. It is
not known that any condemnations have been
made under this statute. Should the author
ities of Canada attempt to enforce it, it will
become my duty to take such steps as may be
necessary to protect the rights of the United
Btates. It has been claimed by Her Majesty's
officers that the fishing vessels of the United
Slates have no right to enter the open port3
of the British posseeaions In North America,
except for the purpose of shelter and repair
ing damages, of purchasing wood and obtain
ing water ; that they have no right to enter
at the British Custom House, or to trade,
except for the purpose of wood and water ; and
that they must depart within twenty-four
hours after notice to leave. It Is not known
that any seizure of a fishing vessel, carrying
the flag of the United States, has been made
under this claim. So far as the claim is foun
ded on the alleged construction of the conven
tion of 1818. it cannot be acquiesced in by the
United States. It is hoped that it will not be
insisted on by Her Majesty's Government.
During the conferences which preceded the
negotion of the convention of 1818, the British
Commissioners proposed to expressly exclude
the fishermen of the United States from the
privilege of carrying on trade with any of His
Britannic Majesty's subjects residing within
the limits asigned for their use, and also that
it should not be lawful for the vessels of the
United States engaged in such fishery to have
on board any goods, wares, or merchandise
whatever, except such as may bejneccessary for
the prosecution ot their voyages to and from
said fishery grounds, and any vessel of the
United States which shall contravene this reg
ulation may be seized condemned and con
fiscated with her cargo. This proposition,
which is identical with the construction now
put upon the language of the convention, was
emphatically rejected by the American Com
missioners, and thereupon was abandoned by
the British Plenipotentiaries, and article 1, as
it stands in the convention, was substituted.
If, however, it he said that the claim is founded
on Provincial or Colonial statutes and not
upon the Convention, this Government cannot
but regard them as unfriendly and in contra
vention of the spirit, if not of the letter, of the
treaty, for the faithful execution of which the
Imperial Government is alone responsible.
Anticipating that an attempt may possibly be
made by the Canadian authorities in the
coming season to repeat their unneighborly
act toward our fishermen, I recommend you to
confer upon the Executive the power to sus-
1end, by proclamation, the operation of the
awa authorizing the transit of goods, wares,
and merchandise in bond across the territory
of the United States to Canada; and further,
snould such an extreme measure' become
necessary, to suspend the operation of any
laws whereby the vessels of the Dominion of
Canada are permitted to enter the waters of the
United States. A like unfriendly disposition
has been manifested on the part of Canada in
the maintenance of a claim of right to exclude
the citizens of the United States from the
navigation of the St. Lawrence. This river
constitutes a national outlet to the ocean for
eight States, with an aggregate population ot
17,600,000 Inhatj'itants, and with an aggregate
tonnage of 681,367 tons upen the waters which
discharge into it. The foreign commerce of
their ports on these waters is open to British
competition, and the major part of it is done
In British bottoms. If the American seamen
be excluded from this uatural avenue to the
ocean, the monopoly ot the direct commerce
ot the lake ports with the Atlantic would be in
foreign hands, their vessels on trans-Atlantic
voyages having an access to our lake ports
which would be denied to American vessels
on similar voyages. To state such proposition
is to refute its justice. During the Adminis
tration of Mr. John Quincy Adams, 3lr. Clay
unquestionably demonstrated the natural
right of the citizens of the United States to
the navigation of this river, claiming that the
act of the Congress of Vienna, in opening the
Rhine and other rivers to all nations, showed
the judgment of European jurists anil states
men, that the inhabitants of a country through
which a navigable river passes have a
natural right to enjoy the navigation of
that river to, and into, the sea, even though
parsing through the territory of another
rower. I his right does not exclude the
co-equal right of the sovereign possessing the ter
ritory through whioh the river debouches to the
sea, to make such regulations relative to the
policy of tho navigation as may be reasonably
necessary, but those regulations should be fram
ed in a liberal spirit of amity, and should not
impose reediest burdens upon the commerce
whioh has the right to transit It has been found
in praotice more advantageous to arrange these
regulations by mutual agreetno.it The United
States are redy to make any reasonable arrange
ment as to the navigation of tbe St Lawrence,
which may be suggested by Great Britain. If
the claim made by Mr. Clay was just, when the
population of the states bordering on the shores
of the lakes was enly 3,400,000, It now derives
greater force and equity from the increased pop
ulation, wealth, produotion and tonnage of the
states on the Canadian frontier. Since Mr. Clay
advanced his argument in behalf of our right,
the principles for whioh he contended have been
frequently and by various nations recognized by
law or by treaty, and been extended to several
other great rivers. By the treaty concluded at
Mayence in 1831, the Rhine was declared free
from the point where it is first navigable into
tbe sea. By the convention held between Spain
and Portugal, concluded in 1835, the navigation
of the Douro throughout its whole extent was
made free for the subjects of both crowns. In
1S52 the Argentine Confederation, by treaty,
threw open the free navigation of the Purawa nnd
Uruguay to the merchant vssels of all nations.
In 185G the Crimean war was olosed by a treaty
whioh provided for the free navigation of the
Danube. In 1858 Bolivia, by a treaty, declared
it regardod the rivers Amazon and La Plata, iu
accordance with fixed principles of national law,
as highways or ohannels opened by nature for
tho commerce ef all nations. ' (
In 1859 the Paraguay was mado free by treaty,
and in December I860, tbe Emperor of Brazil
by imperial deoree deolared the Amazon to be
open to tho fontier of Brazil to the merchant
ships of all nations.
The greatest living British authority on this
subjeot, while asserting the abstract right of the
British claim, says it seems difficult to deny that
Great Britain may ground her refusal upon
strict law. But it is equally diffioult to deny,
first, that iu so doing she exercises harshly an ex
treme and hard law; secondly, that hor conduct
with respect to the navigation of the St. Law
rence is in glaring and discreditable inconsist
ency with her couduot With respeot to tbe navi
gation of the Mississippi. On the ground that
she possessed a small domain in whioh the Mis
sissippi took its rise, she insisted on the right to
navigate the entire volume of its waters. On the
ground that she possesses both bauks of the St
Lawrence where it disembonches itself into the
sea, she denies to the United States the right ot
navigation, though about one-half the watffs of
lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron and Superior ana the
whole e! Lake lliohigan, through wkioh the riv
er flows, are the property of the United States.

The cost of building Iron vessels, the only ones
that can compete with foreign vessels in the
carrying trade-is so much greater in the United
States than in foreign oountries that, without
some assistance from the Government, they can
not be successfully built here. There will be
several propositions laid before congress in the
course of the present session lookiag to a remedy
for the evil. Even if it should be at some cost
to the national treasury, I hope suoh encourage
ment will be given as will secure American
shipping on the high seas, and American ship
building at home.
The conditon of the archives at the department
of state calls for tho early action of congress.
The building now rented by that department is
a frail structure at best, and at an inconvenient
distano. from the Executive Mansion and from
the other departments. It is ill-adapted to the
purposes for which it is used, has not e.pacity to
accommodate the archives, and i not fire-proof
Its remote Mtuation, its slender construction, and
the absence of a sapply of w.ter in the neighbor
hood, leave but little hope of safety for the
building or its contents in esse of the accident of
a Are. Its destruction would involve the loss of
the rolls containing the original acts.aud resolu
tions of congress, of the historic reeords of the
revolution and of the confederation ; of th) whole
series of diplomatic and consular archive since
the adoption of the constitution, and of the many
other valuable records and papers left with that
department when it was the principal depository
of the government archives. I recommend an.
appropriation for the construction of a buildinz
for the Department of State.
I recommend to your consideration the pro
priety of transferring to the Department of the
Interior, to which they seem more appropriately
to belong, all power and duties in relation to
the territories with which the Department of
State is now charged by law or usage ; and from
the Interior Department to the Wsr Department,
the Pension Bureau, so fir a it regulates the
payment of soldiers' pensions. I would farther
recommend that tho payment of naval pension
be transferred to one. of the bureaus of tbe Navy
Deptrtment. ' -

The aver.s; value of gold as compared with
national currency for the whole of the ye.r lstJO
was i:54, and for eleven months of 170 the same
relative valuo his been about 115. The approich
to a sjecio basis U very gratifying, but the fact
cannot be denied that instability of the value of
our currency is prejudicial to our prosperity, and
tend to keep up prices to tho detriment of trade.
The evils of a depreciated and fluctuating cur
rency are so ereat that, now, when the premium
on gold has f illen so much, it would seem that
the time has arrived when by wise, and prndent
legislation congress should look to a policy which
would place our currency at pvr with gold at no
distant day.
The tax collected from the people has been
reduced more than 80 nno o(i'i ri- p.

gatherer may not din

vr un tiie revenue stamp dispensed by post
masters in every community ; a tax upon liquors
of all sorts and tobacco ia all it forms, and by
a wis. adjustment of the tariff, which will put a
duty only upon thoso nrticles which we could
dispense with, known as luxuries, and on those
which we use more of than we produce, revenue
enough may be raised after a few year of peace
and consequent reduction of indebtedness, to
fulfill all our obligations ; and a further reduc
tion of expenses in addition to a reduction ot in
terest accjunt may be relied on to make this
practicable.
Revenue reform, if it means this, has my
hearty support. If it implies a collection of all
tho revenue for the support of the government,
for the payment of principal and interest of the
publio debt, pensions, &0., by directly taxing,
the people, then I am against revenue reform,
and confidently believe tho people are with me.
If it means failure to provide the neoessary
means to defray all expenses of the government,
nnd thereby repudiation of the publio debt and
pensions, then I am still more opposed to such
kind of revenue reform.
Revenuo reform has not been defined by any
of its advocates, in my knowledge, but seems to
be aocepted as something whioh is to supply
every man's wants without any cost or effort
ou his part. A true rovenuo reform cannot be
made in a day, .but must be the work of nation
al legislation and of time. As soon as the rev
onue ean bo dispensed with, all duty should be
removed from coffee, tea, and other articles of
universal use not produced by ourselves. Tho
necessities of the conntry compel us to collect
revenue from our imports. An army of asses
sors and collectors is not a pleasant eight to the
citizens, but that or a tariff for rovenuo is ne
cessary. Such a tariff so far as it acts in en
couragement to home products, affords employ
ment to labor at living wages in contrast to tho
pauper labor of the old world, and also in the
developement of home resources.
Under the act of congress of the 15th day of
July, the army has gradually been reduced, so
that on the first day of January. 1871, the num
ber of commissioned officers and men m all
will not exceed the number ooutemplatod by

The Department building is an old st-uotore,
not fire-proof, and entirely inadequate in dimen
sions to our presont wants. Many thousands of
dollars sre uow paid annually for rent of pri
vate buildings to aooomraodate the various Bu
reaus of the Department.' I recommend aa ap
propriation for a new War Department build
ing, suited to the presont aud growing wants ot
the nation. . -
