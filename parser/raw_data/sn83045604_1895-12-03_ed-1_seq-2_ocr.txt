THE REITBLTI AV CAUCUS.
Sentiment In Favor of Ileoripir
But >'ot Combination.
Washington City, Dec. Z.— After the ad
journment of the senate the Republican
caucus met. Mr. Sherman was elected
chairman of the caucus, and Mr. Dubois
secretary. The discussion was informal,
and around the question whether
the Republican senators, having a plurali
ty but not a majority of the senate,
should attempt a reorganization with Re
publican officers and Republican chair
men of committees. It was evident that the
prevailing feeling favored Republican or
ganization. and some strong speeches were
made, notably by Mr. Davis, of Minneap
olis. and Mr. Aidrich. of Rhode Island,
urging that there would be- no combination
or promise with any element outside the
Republican ranks. This appeared to voice
the general view of the senators,
and no opposition speeches were
made. The question arose, however, as to
w net her the test of strength should be
made by securing the committees or on
the choice of a president pro tem. In or
der to present this issue, Mr. Hoar moved
the appointment of a committee or com
mittees to have charge of a movement to
secure committee reorganization on Re
publican lines. Mr. Hale offered an
amendment for a test on the choice of a
president pro tem. in the informal dis
< ufehion following. Mr. Prye's name was
mentioned a* the probable candidate fur
president pro t> m. Sotne senators raised
the point, however, that the president pro
t« m. could not be elected while the pre
siding officer was present and acting un
der the senate rules. It was finally decid
ed that no vote should be taken at pres
ent, and Messrs. Hoar and Halo withdrew
their motions.
The understanding was that a definite
line of a. tion would bo agreed on at the
meeting Wednesday, following the session
of that day. The principal reason for the
withdrawal of resolutions for the appoint
ment of a caucus committee by the chair
was the discovery of the fact that there
was a largo element in the caucus op
posed to the selection of a committee by
appointment. It is now understood that
when the resolution Is renewed It will bo
antagonized by a substitute providing f>r
the selection of the committee by the
caucus.
FEW DEMOCRATS LEFT.
Only I'llleen From tho North In the
New House.
Washington City. Dec. 2.—The utter rout
of the Democratic party in the congres
sional elections last fall became apparent
for the firs? time to the eye wh<-n
the new house of representatives assembled
today. No such revolution in the person
nel of the members has occurred in recent
years. Exactly 161 new faces appeared
In a total of 3MJ members. Some of the
oldest and most tried leaders among tho
Democrats were swept out by the
tide which rolled tip a Republican ma
jority of 14»i in the Fifty-fourth house.
Out of ninety-four districts north of Ma
son and Dixon's line which were represent
ed by Democrats in the last congress, but
fifteen returned Democrats to the new
house. Tho Democrat!' victory <>f IR9O.
which turned a Republican majority for
the Fifty-first congress of five Into a Dem

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER. TUESDAY. DECEMBER 3, IWS.
DEMOCRATS FALL OUT
Mike McDonald's Eloquence
Started the Fight.
THEY LOCKED THEMSELVES IN.
Por Half an Hour the Battle Raced and
the Furniture Was All smashed
—An Altgeld Victory.
Chicago, Dec. 2 —The hall of the Cook
County Democracy was tonight the scene
of a desperate free-for-all fight, in which
clubs, chairs, canes ard fists were freely
used. There was a contest between John
Powers and Thomas Gahan, the latter an
Aligeld man. for the chairmanship of the
county cemral committee. The trouble be
gan when Mike McDonald arose, as he pu*«
It, "to tell the miserable, low-down Gahan
men to push a few things about them
selves." Gahan numbers John H. Hor^ in3 .
the ex-mayor among his friends, and Mc-
Donald devoted a large portion of his pun
gent eloquence to Hopkins and his adrnin-*
lstratlon. The burden of his grievance
lay in the assertion that Hopk:r.s misappro*
priatcd campaign funds and that MaDon
ald was sued for expenses toward which
these funds should have been applied.
A big man sitting on a window sill be
came so much moved by McDonald's flow
ery language that he whacked a Gahan
man in the eye—and then it was all over
the place. The doors were locked and the
fight raged for half an hour. When there
wore no chairs left, and everything in the
room was «masht <2. Powers and his frends
withdrew, having lost the poytical battle,
but ready for more of the physical Burt.
A REVOLT AGAI»T PL ATT.
New York Republicans Threaten to
Split the Party.
New York. Dec. 2.—William Brookfleld.
Cornelius N. Bliss, Gen. Anson C. McCook
and other leaders of anti-Platt Republic
ans, will hold a meeting this week to de
cide on steps to effect a change in the
methods of Republican organization of
this city. The date and place of meeting,
Mr. Brookfield said, has not yet been fix
ed. "But," he added, "I shall do all In
my power to bring together all tho Re
publicans who believe that reform is nec
essary." "Are you in favor of starting a
new organization?" "I do not care to ex
press any point just now," Mr. Brook
tield replied. "I will say, however, that
a change is necessary, whether it is ac
complished by a bolt or by a tight within
the organisation. We have tried the light
within and have not been very successful.
What will be done next year Is yet to be
determined. It seems to me that the only
*jy to bring about anything like harmony
is for the Republican county committee
to elect for its chairman some broad-gaug
ed, liberal-minded Republican, wtio has
r.ot been identified with any faction and
who stands for clean methods in politics.
If that course is not followed, something
else will have to be done."
The meeting of the antl-Platt leaders
wiil probably take place early this week,
as tne Republican primaries will be held
next Tuesday night. It is not believed
that the leaders will decide to make much
of a fight at the primaries. It seems to
be the intention first to appeal to the Piatt
men to retire Rauterbach and place at the
bead of the county committee a man such
as Mr. Brook field directs. If the appeal
is ignored, then the threat made last week
by Cornelius X. Bliss may be carried into
effect. Mr. Bliss at the time recalled tho
Folger campaign of IKS 2. and intimated
that history might repeat itself next year
If the Piatt people persisted in their pres
ent course.

ANOTHER OUTBREAK IN KOREA.
The Royai Guard Tries, but Falls to
Enter the Palace.
New York. Dec. 3.—A special to the. FTt
a!i from St Petersburg says: Another
disturbance broke out in Seoul, the capital
of Korea, on November 28. during which
the royal guard tried to obtain hy forca
entrance to the palace. It appears, how
ever, that they were not successful. It is
stated on authority that there were' Ame
ricans mixed up in the conspiracy. The
Japanese deny that they have anything
whatever to do with this latest conspiracy
in Korea, but they are inclined to think
that the retirement of the Japanese
troops will be the signal for a'.l the old
troubles to recommence as ia former
times.
The CathoUc Kntehtw of Pvthin*.
Boston, Dec. 2.—A Traveller special from
New York says: James I. Mulligan, post
master at New Brighton, N. Y, recently
chosen provisional chairman of a commit
tee on appeal organiz-d to take some d»»-
cisive step toward having set aside the
pronunc amento that all Catholics must
sever their relations with the Knights of
Pythias, Odd Fellows and the Sons of
Temperance, under pain of excommunica
tion, is now preparing an address to be
presented to Mgr. Satoili, asking for a
formal reopening of the case of the
Knights of Pythias, that the -Catholio
members thereof may have an opportu
nity to present their sidfe of the case. Mr.
Mulligan believes that a proper presenta
tion of the case to Mgr. Satolli will
the ban airainst the Knights, and he asks
all Cathol cs throughout the country to
forward their names and addresses to
him. that they may be attached to tlfe
petition whii-h will be adiressed to the
papal delegate. In an interview Mr. Mul
ligan said: "If all the Catholics in the
Knights of Pythias win co-operate in this
movement, I believe that Msr. Satol'i will
give them a hearing, and I am sure that
we will be ah!e to prove convincingly that
there is nothing in the constitution, by
laws or ritual of the order that will pre
vent a man from being a good Catholic
and a patriotic citizen."
The Socialist Knltrhls of l^ihor.
New York, Dec. 2.—District Assembly 25.
Knights of Labor, his adopted resolutions
advocating the formation of a new inter
national onr tnlzation to be composed of
the socialistic element of the Knights of
Labor throughout the country. When the
socialists belonging to District Assembly
4i» belted the Knights of Labor, on motion
of l'atrlek Murphy, ex-secretary
of District Assembly 49, they forfeited all
rights and privileges! of membership in
the general organization. Thomas B. Mc
tiuire, a member of the executive board of
the Knights of Labor. speaking to a re
porter tonight, said: "The bolt of the so
cialists is not at all a serious affair. It
does not affect either District Assembly 49
or the Knights of Labor. By their own
act the socialists have expelled themselves
from the Knights of Labor. Under section
111 of our laws a withdrawal practically
amounts to an expulsion."
The < a-><- for MaJ. Armc#
Washington City, Dec. 2.—Counsel, for
MaJ. George A. Armess whose sensational
arrest several months ago for Insubordina
tion by order of MaJ. Gen. Schofieid, then
acting secretary of war, was followed by
his discharge by Judge Bradley with a
scathing denunciation of the arrest, filed
their briefs today in reply to the govern
ment's appeal to the court cf appeals.
They ask the discharge of Armed from
further liability, first, because no power
whatever existed to imko the arrest, and
second, because he was not informed of
the naturo of the accusations against him.
Counsel say there has been no process of

arrest was unjust, a violation of the fciw
and subversive of the liberty of the citi

lower court be affirmed. Military law,
counsel argues, !s supreme in military

case was argued in the appellate court to
day. Counsel for both sides reviewed their
contention.
Retaliation cm Canada.
Washington City, Dec. 2.—lt is appre
hended here that the withdrawal by the
Canadian authorities of the right exercis
ed by American tisherm<yi. for seven years
past of buying bait and supplies in Can
adian waters may lead to reprisals at the
hands of congress, for It has been contend
ed all along that the privilege enjoyed by
Canadian railroads of carrying goods in
bond through the United States was more
than a sufficient offset to the favors ex
tended to American fishermen by Canada.
The action of the Canadian government
just taken has not yet been officially re
ported to the state department, but it is
regarded here as an indication of Can
ada's purpose to emphasize the necessity
for renewal of negotiations looking to a
new fishery treaty.

MASEL CASE ENDED.
Conncil Dismisses the Charges
Against the Absentee.
HIS OFFICE WAS VACATED.
Delegates Adopt the Aldermen's Sol
emn I'iedtfw on t!nj >VMter Ques
tion—Railroad Franc*Ulse«.
An en 1 was reached In the long- contin
ue! so-called trial of Fire Commissioner
Masel last night by the city council dis
missing the charges against him. The tin
ale was marked with a grand display of
verbal pyrotechnics. The case was brought
up in joint convention by Crichton moving
that the council take up the charges.. Cor
poration Counsel Scott said that on behalf
of the mayor he would dismiss the
charges. As Masel had removed from the
city, he had vacated his office, and as the
council could not punish a man for any
thing, it would be useless to try the
charges. He r«*iewed the history of the
case, and said that In his opinion a man
could not hold a public ofßee and remove
from the city. It was Incompatible with
the duties of a public office that an officer
should remove from the city for the pur
pose of securing employment, to return
whenever he should think best to suit his
own convenience. The only object of fil
ing charges against an officer is to re
move him from office; this council cannot
punish-a man. It can only render a judg
ment that a .man ought to be removed
from office. Now, if he has remove 1 him
self, a judgment of removal would be sim
ply nonsense. For that reason tho cor
poration counsel refused to further ap
pear in the prosecution of the charges.
The mayor had told them that he has re
moved from tlie city, and the mayor can
not now ask the council to render any
judgment one way or the other.
Jordon—We are not a packed jury.
Scott—l never packed a jury—l do not
practice law that way.
Jordan—The difference between us and »
packed jury is that we! have a judgment
of our own, and that a packed Jury has
been previously bought. We are told that
Masel lost his position because he went ous
to find work. The question is whether the
man had a right to go as a free citizen
to get employment, and come bavk as soon
as he was needed. He has been maligned
and the public has been led to believe
ho was a thief—a robber. It was his mis
fortune to be elected an officer of the city,
but it was not a crime. The question is,
has Mr. Masel left the city or not. The
mayor says he has, Mr. Masel says he
has not. I think this body is to get
through with this case, and I therefore
move you that the charges against Masel
be "sanctified"—proceeding according to
tlia words of the charter.
Lovejoy—l move you. as an amendment
to Dr. Jordan's motion, that we cease to
further consider the charges iiied against
Mr. Masel.
A discussion then enused as to the rightq
of the council, anil what the proper method
of procedure was, and the longer the mem
bers talked the deeper they seemed to get.
Mo: lons, amendments and substitutes came
thi> k and fast. Voigt iinally got the floor
and made a speech that brought on a con
flict between him and Wiley. He wanted to
put himself on record as claiming that the
council had the right to dismiss the charges
whenever it saw tit, "notwithstanuing. the
opinions of the hired attorney." He agreed
with Dr. Jordan that it was certainly Tin
fortunate that certain persons w re elect
ed to office, and he frequently had that
feeling when the council was in joint ses
sion.
Wiley—The gentleman Who has just
spoken has played evjry part in this
from witness to judge, and to advocate—"
Voigt (excitedly)— What's that? I deny
that. I have played no part, 1 ha\e done
my duty.
President Daulton was pounding his
desk with his gavel, trying to stop the
hubbub, but Wiley got hi that he was
sorry Darwin had not prosecuted his
search in the Sixth ward. He was quick
ly interrupted by Voigt. who, trembling
with anger, advanced towards Mr. Wiley,
and told him that if he thought he could
make such statements as that, he was mis
taken. even if he was s'x Inches toller than
himself. Daulton finally got order, and
Hurd wanted to know if they were go ng
to be compelled to sit there n ght after
night and listen to that kind of talk.
The previous question was moved on the
Lovejoy amendment to cease consider
ing the charges, which was lost. The
question then came up on JorJan's motion,
and the roll call was asked. After a dis
cussion as to the vote required, Crichton
said a motion to sanctify was only !n or
der after the charges had been heard, but
for a vote of guilty or not guilty it would
require a two-thirds vote, and for a mo
tion to dismiss only a majority.
Compton moved and Clise seconded a
motion to reconsider the Lovejoy motion.
Mr. Wiley—The proper way to straight
en out matters is to declare the motion of
Dr. Jordan premature and out of order.
Dr. J )rdan—Hear h~m! We are doing
the best we can and you go to work to
upset everybody and everything.
Mr. Wiley flushed up and went over to
Dr. Jordan, saying he was doinsr nothing
of the sort. He tried to explain, but the
doctor wouldn't hear him. They seeme 1
to be quarreling, and when Mr. Wiley sa-.v
a chance, as he thought, to get in a word
or two he begin, "Now, I think—" but Dr.
Jordan retorted, "Yes, you think, and if
you ore g it.g 11 do my thinking you c>a
do my voting," and he whisked himself
into th» adjoining chamber.
Finally, Goodhue moved that the charges
i e dismissed, which wis immediately sec
onded by Gleeson and put ta the vote.
Fifteen voted for it and one against, the
vote being as follows:
Anderson, Clise, Comptpn, Lovejoy.
Sweeney, Chnprr»f. Oleeson, Oondhu*,
Hurd, James. Kistler, LiUl", Vofgt, Crich

In the house of delegates last right the
resolution pass< d by the l>oard of aldermt A
last week denouncing the people in ca-e
they should reject the Cedar river water
ordinance and pledging the council not "to
make a contract with any corporation giv
ing it or them the right to own in whole
"or In part jointly with this city or other
wise, any part of the Cedar river gravity
system" came up for aotion.
Little moved the adoption of the resolu
tion, and James seconded. The latter said,
however, that the resolution went too far.
It was perfectly legitimate so far as water
and light was concerned, but hea'ihg need
not have been included, and then* was no
occasion for hitting at the newspapers.
However, it was hardly worth while mov
ing an amendment to it.
The motion was put and in "xplalning hi*
vote Yoigt said: "We have shown that ws
do not want any corporation to bring either
water or light or anything e'se to the city
so long as the city can prevent it, and
there is 'herefore no need of this resolu
tion, and for this reason I reluctantly
vote 'aye.' "
Crichton—l would like to explain my vote.
I believe the resolution is entirely uncall
ed for in every respect. If the ordinances
we pass go for anything at ail, our vote;!
show the opinion this house holds. If we
pass resolutions for fun and do not intend
to 'ive up to thejn, It may be necessary to
pass resolutions constantly to show when
we ere in earnest. Th's resolution goes
too far; a, great deal farther tfian the or
dinance itself, with its el<vtric lighting,
electric heating, and I don't know what ail.
It is nof frame! to givo the people an un
derstanding of what the ordinanc» is,
what it is framed for I do not care to say,
except that it is as far from that as It
be. I believe the people of this city un
derstar.d us and understand how »h!s "Our>>
r'l fepls. I am willing to ah!**; by the or
dinance, to carry out the ordinance; but I
am no* pofr? to votefo r this resolution.

Cori ntion Counsel R'ott took up the

The committer on railroads, to r/hJch

frjnchis's, r«»commendeii that only such

t.tion as will conform with routes covered
by tracks now, and for some time past, in
operation by the road, and that all por
t'.or.m of the petition relating to new routes
!,*» rejected. James said that there was no
objection to the two or three blocks ex
t*-nsi''n of the line to Kinnear park, but
that the extension over Fifth street from
Pike to WMlow e nd to the Great Northern
ru lrcad d»pot was a new ltn". He * not
f *h it to go out that a franchise for this
had been rejected and asked that the re
port Ne referred, and to this the house
agreed.
The amended ordinance askM for by the
S'-ittie Montana Railroad Company for

South Fifth streets came up for ptan>
and was about to be passed when CaS

said its-provisions would be valid If ts»

and Its duties devolve upon some at*.
body or upon a ccmmittce of the eounei
Crichton asked what provisions had b«ts
made for paving and grading tht mm
on which this franchise was given, ac 4 3
