Imuis? Do you want to ask questions
ahout all these things and feel -that
tin- young men in charge will not
hi uuli at you?
Come, right this way, ladies and
."ent lemon. The opportunity is here
and will be here until Friday for a
complete outfit from Camp Bragg un
der the command of Capt. J. C. Pat
terson is encamped in the rear of the
postofiice and the three officers and 30
men in charge are here for the sole
purpose of letting Hickory and Ca
tawba county people see the parapher
nalia of war and ask all about them.
That is no joke. Something is do-in-
nil the time. Ask one of the
young men at one of the machines
about anything, and he straightway!
will explain. Also he
will take you
to another machine, where it also
will be explained. In the meantime
you will be learning something about
field artillery and equipment. Ladies
wlni are interested in the culinary
art may also see a rolling kitchen--in
operation. The artillery show is 'in
progress at all times. , , ,
None of the equipment has been
overseas, but the young men in charge
have faced the cannon's mouth, as it
were, though they did most of their
. hooting by indirect-fire, but they
were on the job, all right and are glad
to show you what the things they
have can do.
The unit here is the third provis
ional platoon, fifth field artillery brig
ade, and it is worth seeing. Here is
the equipment:
Two 155-Millimctre'howitzers, four
caterpillar tractors, four ambulance
trucks, two caissons, "one Browning
light machine gun.- You will notice
that the big guns are camouflaged.
The platoon will leave Friday for

RUE STORY
American newspaper readers will re
member how the "lost battalion re
mained at its post in the Argonne
Forest
readers
until
relieved.
Tl
ie:
am
know of
some of the glamour !
feat of those troops, ;
surrounding the
and they will be interested in the real
facts of the battalion, as furnished
by the New York Herald. Colonel
Whittlessey did not swear and the
(iermans never got near -the Yankees
which was lucky for the dermaiis
but here is the way the lleraHl tells
the story:
New York Herald.
Members of a famous unit of the
:!0Sth regiment f infantry, American
expeditionary forces, must have been
surprised to find that the battalion
had developed a legend, acquired a
tradition and become associated with
a saying of the war,rnll thr.ee
which the nublic hangs on to and
of
re
vises to ft co in suite ot the enorts
of the soldiers themselves.
According to the "legend," it was
"the Lost battalion." Yet it was never
lost. The fact is that the men un
der command' of Charles W. Whitt
lesey now lieutenant-colonel and one
of the striking American figures of
the war started for an objective in
the Arg.(nn.forest,r.cached., it, dug
in, stayed there with serene determi
nation" until relieved and laughed
when they went to the rear, after
suffering starvation and thirst for
days, to find that they were heroes.
Their experience was very like that
of a celebrated body of troops at
Gettysburg, the members of which
asked for coffee when proffered praise
at the end of the third day.
As for the "tradition," -it is to the
effect that the (iermans were so in
pressed by the gallant,' if suicidal,
madness of the Americans that they
lid not feel like wiping tnem out.
- The fact is that the dear enemy
never rot a chance to wpie them out,
ut on the contrary touno mat uie
had picked up the very hottest sort
of a hot potato, which was too much
for the select troops of the kaisers
euards who were on the other side,
with their backs toward Berlin.
As 'for the "saying!" This is at
fribtued to Col Whittlessey, who so
it was reported when requested to
surrender, for the general comfort ot
everybody, replied, "Co to hell."
The facts are: First, that none
of the Prussians ever got withm
speaking distance of the battalion
whifli would have been very perilous
-Tnr thorn and. second, that this ohV
" ' . , !
cer
has never been Known uv
any
member of his family, or any acquaint
ance, or anv soldier under him, to use
a "swear" word. Besides he asserts
that he did not say it, and he is a
truthful man, in addition to being an
officer and a gentleman. .
Of course it won't do murh harm
to the colonel to have his name go re
verbating down the corridors of time
associated wth a volent statement. He
can afford t. It pleases the public
and can't hurt him much as a user
of cautious and chaste English. V-e-sides
other military persons of emi
nence from Marshal Canbronne to
Admiral John Phillip, have been tied,
up to historical remarks of an apoch-
ryphal nature. ,

A romance has been added

to adorn the record for ill tifUe, or

tions prescribed by the fuel adminis
tration, municipally speaking, 'whatev
er mav be the case in plants and
stores. Mayor Kll iott received instruct-;
ions . for the city and has complied j
last night, a lone standard glowing on j
with them. The white way was not on '
each corner so as to provide the nec
essary light for pedestrians and to ;
protect property against thieves. The
moon helped out last night and will j
continue to do so. .
Just how far the regulations will i
be observed by the stores was not ;
made clear today. Merchants indi- j
cated a readiness to comply with both j
the letter and spirit of the order, and :
persons who want to make purchases I
will have to do so between the hours
of 9 a. m. and 4 p. m.
Many merchants declare they did
not mind the restrictions placed upon
them during the war, but some do not
like the late opening and early closisg
just before the holiday season, when ,
so many people are, anxious to make ,
their Christmas purchases. j
The best way is for everybody to
start early in the morning and start ;
right now. , The shops will be busy I

for the eleventh-hour rush. i

i A considerable part of the person
I nel of the delegation will leave Brest
j on the evening of Decemlior 5, how-

1 It is learned from a high authority
j that the change of the delegation to
sail is due to the failure of the
' (Iermans to sign the peace treaty pro
tocol. It is pointed out that if the
Germans fail to sign the protocol, the
status of the war' will go back to the
signing of the armistice.
Hence the United States is still
ouite as much interested as its asso
ciates of the allied powers, desnite the
; failure of the senate to ratify the
i treaty.

PEOPLE CAN
LOCAL
The people of Hickory and this sectioii
who do their trading' here can assist in the
conservation of fuel by making their pur
chases between the hours of 9 a. m. and 4
p. m. so that local dry goods stores will find
it easier to close in accordance with the re
quirements of the fuel administration. No
exception has been granted dry goods, jew
elry and other stores other than grocery
and meat in places where hydro-electric
power is used for lighting.
Sine these regiflations will continue
into effect for an indefinite time, it is hoped
that every person in -this whole section will
begiirhis Christmrts'shdpp ing so as to avoid
the rash the last few clays before Christ
mas. Start now.
Grocery and meat stores are permitted
to remain open until 6 p. m. except Satur
days, when they may remain open until 9
p. m.
The local public is urged to cooperate,
in every way with the merchants. .
The stockholders of the Catawba
i county Fair Association met at the
! Chamber of Commerce rooms Satur
; day evening, and with the greatest
; enthusiasm resolved to make the 1920
I fail- the best ever. The association
' went on record as favoring good
I amusements, but as against games of
; chance as usually conducted by many
; of the concessions that accompany
tented shows.
I President Clark again gave notice
that it was up 0to some one else to
: assume the responsibilities of presi-
dent: of the fair association, but ex
pressed, a willingnes to give the next
i president all the help he could. Inas
i much as Mr. Clark leaves the book
lvalue of fair stock way above par,
j the directors for 1920 .will have, a
i clean bill of health to start in, the
' work for the next fair.
The regular annual meeting of the
fair association will be held January i

; directors and president will be select-1
; ed, and it is planned to begin work j
i immediately on plans for that year. ;
M EN
ARE WANTED
FOR FOREIGN 'SERVICE
With 115,000 men signed up for
new peace time army, the war depart
ment is calling for 7500 for service
outside the continental limits, of the
United. States. Practically all
branches of the service are represent
ed in these forces, which are station
ed from the tropics to the pole and
from Greenwich meridian to', the far
east. '
The Panama canal zone needs 3400
men to complete its quota, 1232 of
these are needed by the infantry, 1347
by the coast artillery, and the balance
by the cavalry, engineers, signal
corps, medical department, and
quartermaster corps.
The Philippine Department is call
ing for 1320 men for coast artillery
i and wants 525 more for the engineers,
! ordnance and medical department.
Infantry and cavalrv enlistments
I were closed some time ago due to the
popularity of tropical service with
! foreign service pay. All troops in
: the Philippines and the far east
I draw theincreased pay for foreign
: service.
1 In addition to the. hundred men
i authorised for service in the Medi
jcal Department' there are seventh
i vacancies in the ordance department
I in Hawaii. It won't take long for
the recruiting service to get these
170 men as they luve the whole
United States to draw from. Schley
Rogers of Waynesville was the first
man from North Carolina to take ad
vantage of this offer when he signed
up at Asheville this week.
Alaska wrtnts 115 men for the
infantry, and Siberia needs 1213
men. 1200 for the infantry and 13 for
the signal corps, Alaskan and Si
berian services as well as service
with the A. F. in France and Ger
many carry with them the provisions
of' foreign service pay, twenty per
cent of the base pay in addition to
the regular allowances.
The peace time army is devoid of
the many hardships endured during
the war period. The supply, of food
is good and regular. Pay is received
each month without fail, passes and
furloughs are in vogue, and all the
w.irfjivp activities are running in full
blast
with more time tor recreation.

Los Angeles Nov. ' 29. The Salton
Sea in the Imperial Valley, one of the
natural wonders of the west, is cou
stantly shrinking. At present it is j system willi .siniplilicatioii f ih
about If? miles long and nine miles j income and excess profits
wide at the greatest point. During j Readjustment of the tai nf -.v. inn

which is eagerly seized by homestead-Slates is the greatest racialist in
ers. Often their location stakes are ft he world"
planted far out in the water.
The sea which lies 100 feet below
the level of the ocean abounds in fish,
mullets, and carp which local and Ari
z'onan capitalists are planning to uti
lize by erection of a great cannery.

Would become an inland sea, remaining
so for centuries, perhaps until some
great flood would carve out a shorter
way to the ocean. The sea would be
drained and the region relapse into a
desert.
Mud volcanoes abound near the sea,
a short distance inland. They are.
of all sizes up to great mounds 10
feet in height. . They all emit steam
some in a steady stream, other stream
and mud alternately. Many of them
give out a sulphurous gas. At times !
their roaring can be heard for miles. I
More and more, the sea is being I
visited by tourists and during the '
heated season, when the temperature j
is from 10 to 20 degrees cooler than j
in the valley towns, dances are f re-!
quently held on an old wharf, which
once served ; as a landing place for
fishing boats but which has been left
high and dry by the receding waters.
Of special interest to the tourist
are the bubbling "paintpots." As
the water retreats it is in a state of
constant ebullition. Cases from some
unknown subterranean source are
perts to be fully, equal to the dry
sienna and umber colors, of which so
much is imported.
It is thought that the shrinkage
of the Salton Sea will continue until it
.finally becomes a salt "sink" with a
pool of brackish water in the center
unless a fresh outburst of the great
Colorado should replenish its waters.
