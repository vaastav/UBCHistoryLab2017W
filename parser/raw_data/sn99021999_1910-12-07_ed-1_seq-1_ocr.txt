TIim criminal proceedings erew otit ofa
suit to dissolve the alleged combinat.on
begun by the government In the federal
court at Baltimore, hearing; being held

the last forty days.
The evidence waa presented to tne grand
Jury by Edwin P. Grosvenor. special ass sl
ant to the attorney general; I'nlted States
restrict Attorney Frank H. Watson of De
troit and Jose Carling. special aeent of the
Department of Justice. . Secret hearings
began yesterday and nothing waa given out
until the Indictments were handed down
this afternoon. It was charged that as
the result of a ten dais' meeting at Ml.
Clemens. Mich., last April, a fund of J7.000
was subscribed to ret In motion a pan
that resuite.1 In giving the defendants con-
trol of slxleen manufacturers and nearly

provlmately S10.IXO 000 a year.

The two Indictments against each defend
ant conta'n six and four counts, respect- i
lvely. and charge that the defendants, con
trolling 8". per cent of the annual output,
combined to restrain the trade of manu
facturers and jobbers of plumbing supplies
by refusing to mil to the jobbers handling
the goods of so-called Independents, by
the. fixing of resale prtcea. by the division
of the I'nlted States into eleven zones and
refusing to sell to Jobbers who would not I
maintain the resale prices. It Is charged
that the effect of these resale prices la to
make the pr ce the same throughout the
1'nlted States and to eliminate competition
of Jobbers as well as of manufacturers.
""".a bidtt'tmenta M charge that the de
fendants compelled t'ne Jobbers to enter
Into uniform contracts and thai all the
defendants refused to sell to any Jobber
unieaa he would sign such a contract.
The government officials took the ground
that the evidence taken. In the civil -suit
established that the defendants attempted
to disguise their combination by the sub
terfuge of purchaslnsy the patents on cer
tain tools and licensing certain firms to
use these tools.
Way man's Tntlnioar I aiportaat.
The government places great weight
upon the testimony of Edwin L. Wayman
of Pittsburg, who Is described as the
licenser of the altered combination ami
whose, testimony already given In the
civil ault has given him Immunity from j
criminal proceedings.
The government charges that Wayman
obtained ST.OiO from the Peoples State bank
of DeiRjIt by giving luO shares of the
Standard Sanitary Manufacturing company
as security and that In using this fund
to purchase several patents, Sf.ouo went
bark to the Standard Sanitary Manufac
turing company for patents that It la al
leged to have turned over to the combi
nation. Wayman is not a voluntary wlt
neea. Tha government chargta that Wayman
collected SS per, day for each furnace from
each of the sixteen defendant firms, some
of which had as many as eighty furnaces
and that after two months these firms that
did net violate the agreement were to re
ceive a rebate of Su per cent of this con
tribution. Wayman's collections. It la al
leged, ran as high as fTQO per day.
The defendants against whom Indictments
were found today will be required to
appear at once in the United States court

Mr. Howell, on returning last evening,
declined at the preeent time to make any
statement, owing to the fact, stated by
him, that he felt that he Deparment of I
Justice should be the first to receive In- I
for nation coming from him. Advlces from
Ha-itlngs are to the effect that the federal
inspection will result In a report that the
story of sybaritic repast and sumptuous
furnishings la false.
The special agent told Sheriff McCleary
at Hastings he "found everything all
right."
Who the a?ent of the Department of
Justlre is was not learned In Hastings;
neither was It learned last night In Omaha.
Ithough the agent himself was seen by
newspaper men. A detailed report of the
facts as found by the government In
spector, specially detailed, may be given
out here any time.
Attorney Howell and the special exam
iner were In the Jail about an hour making
an Inventory of the furnishings and talk
ing with the prisoners. As a result of the
inspection the sheriff expects the govern
ment to send him a set of rules specifying
exactly how the prisoners shall be treated.

This roaMltaeary Are Re
tarwed by Good Plu
ralities. LONDON. Dec. . The return of a fur
ther Met of unopposed Redmondites this
afternoon sent the coalitionists attain to
the front with a total of 131 seats In the
new parliament, against 138 now held by
the unionists.
The state of the parties a named Is as
follow-s:
Government Coalition Liberals, 90; Irish
nationalists, S; labor members, IS. Total.
13L
Opposition Unionist US.
John Sharp Hlsrhara of the Sewar'iy di
vision of York was the sole liberal re
turned unopposed today. Among the na-
Uonallets rechoeen without contest were
Jnn num ot Mayo an1 William H. K
Redmond of Clare. Among the unionists
unopposed were Sir Charles A. Crirjpa,
Wlcombe division of Bucldngtmmshlre;
James William Lowther, speaker of the
House of Commons, of Cumberland, and
Erneet Gardner of Berkshire.
The prmlnent features In today's early
returns In the pa-iiamentary elections was
the capture of Sunderland by the coalition
pajrtine. T. Hamar Greenwood, the Cana
dian liberal, who returns to the House of
Ccmmona after an absence of less than a
year, and Frank Golds-tone, the labortte.
turned out the two unionist members. S.
Storey. Independent tariff reformer, and J.
Knott, who were elected last January by
majorities of 711 and 1.312. respectively.
The polling took place In Sunderland
yesteruay, but the results were not an
nounced until today. Greenwood received
a majority of 1.6ST, and Goldstone had a
margin of 991 rotes.
The turn over Is attributed In part at
least to the bitterness of the bollermakers
In tha Sunderland district, who were locked
out some months before.
The reeultsj In Newcastle-on-Tyne wea-e
also mado known for the first time today.
They show no change, E3- Shortt, liberal,
being returned by a majority of S t, and
W. Hudson, labortte. being re-elected with
S.532 votes to spare. In the preceding
election the liberal and labortte majorities
over the unionista were 4,712 and 4.174, re
spectively. Among the unopposed returned was John
Dillon, nationalist member for the east
division of Mayo.

WASHINGTON. Dec. S.-Practlcsl'.y s'.l
the time In both houses of congress today
was occupied In the reading of President
Taft s message. In the se a.te three new
senators were sworn In. T'.ey are Claude
A. Swanson of Irginla. who succeeds the
late John W. Daniel. Joseph M. Terrell
of Oeorgis. successor to the late Penator
A. 8 Clay, and tjifayrtte Young of Iowa,
who takes the seat made vacant by the
death of Senator J. P. Dolllver.
In the house the message commanded
the attention of th members to the i
clusion of other business.
Both houses adjourned early until noon
tomorrow.
I am here to do the will of the peo
ple." said Senator Young, after his In
duction into office. "I wear no mens
collar and whether I remain In the senate
for a short or for a long period. I am
going to do the best for the country that
I know h!m. I can say. however. It feels
good to be a senator of the United States."
Heading; of Message.
Congress gave respectful attention to
President Taft's message today, but there
were comparatively few members who were
willing to concede the probability of fav
orable action at the preoent session on
many of the recommendations contained
therein. This was In view of the fact that
the session will close March 4.
The message waa delivered to both houses
by Secretary Lett a soon after they con
vened at noon. Mr. Latta made his first
appearance In th enate, arriving Imme
diately after the announcement of th
president's Intention to communicate hla
views "In writing."
This announcement was made by Sen
ator Cullom on behalf of himself and Sen
ator Money, who constituted the senatorial
committee to Inform the president that the
senate was prepared to receive recom
mendations from him. Almost Immediately
afterward Mr. Latta delivered the message
to tha house. Th reading of th document,
which waa of unusual length, was begun
at 13:19 p. m. In the senate. At flret most
of th senators listened attentively to tha
reading, but gradually this attention ceased,
on th part of most of them and those who
remained In th chamber devoted them
selves to printed copies before them. This
also was the case In the house.
Webster at White Howae.
John L. Webster, at the special requeet
of President Taft, caJled at tha Whit
House today, and It Is understood dlecm-sod
Judge W. D. McHugh for a plaa on th
supreme bench. He also dlscusued with tha
president several other names that have
been suggested for vacancies In that trib
unal. Later, on the Invitation of Attorney
General Wtckeraliam, Mr. Webstar covered
much of th same field he had befor gon
over with the president as to availebi ma
terial for th supreme court
Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma bank
guaranty cases, which have been invited
for argument before the supreme court,
will in all probability be reached tomor
row. Counsel for the state of Nebraska,
ro far aa is known, have not settled tha
question a to who should make argument
for thetr client, but It may be that upon
request of Attorney General Mullen both
Whedon and Albert will be heard, th time
allotted to the side of th state being
divided between them. Mr. Webster will
present the bankers' side of th case, hla
associate. ex-Senator W. V. Allen, havlnc
decided to remain In Nebraska.
