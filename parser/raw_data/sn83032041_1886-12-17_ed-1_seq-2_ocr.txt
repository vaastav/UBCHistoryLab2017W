sentiment with true Americin enthusi

forego an idle surplus in the public
t reasury.
And all the people know that. the rate
of federal taxation upon imports to-day
in time of peace is but littl less, while

ti,,n it is artuallv more than was imtiosed !
bv the grievous burden willingly borne,
at a time when the Government needed
millions to maintain by war the safety
and integrity of the Union.
It has been the policy of the Govtrn
meit to collect the principal part of its
revenues by a tax upon imports, and no
change m this policy is desirable. But
the present condition of affairs constrains
our peop'e to demand that by revision of ,
our revenue laws the receipts of the j

necessary expense of its economical ad-

be recognized and obeyed by the people's
representatives in the legislative branch
of the Government.
READJUSTING THE BURDKNS.
In readjusting the burdens of federal
taxation, a sound public policy requires
that such of our citizens as have built
up large, and important industries under
present conditions should not be sudden
ly and to their injury deprived of ad var- ;
hlnesa but ,f theJpublic good requires
t,ie, 'should be content with uch !

A reasonable and timely submission :
to such a demand should certainly be ;
possible without disastrous slun k to any ;
interest ; and a cheerful concession some- '
times averts abrupt and heedless action, :
often the outgrowth of impatience aud j
delayed justice.
Due regard should also he accorded in '
ixi.y proposed readjustment to the inter- j
ests of American labor, so far as they
art involved. We congratulate ourselves

doomed urdr all conditio
that there is anions' us no laboring class
bounds and
oris to the inex-
oranle fate cf daily toil. We recognize
in labor a chief factor in the wealth of
the republic, and we treat those who
have it in their keeping as citiz-ns enti
tied to the most thoughtful regard and
careful attention. This regaid and at
tention should be awarded them, nor
only because labor Is the capital of oui
woikingmen, justly entitled to its share
of Government favor, but for the further
and not b-ss important reason that th
laboring man, surrounded by his family

The relation of the workingman to
the revenue laws of the country and the
manner in which it palpably influences
the question of wages, should not be
forgotten in tliQ justifiable prominence
civen to the Drot.er maintenance of the
sntmlv and Protection of well naid labor.

A,,d tbese considerations suggest such

things consumed by all arr perhaps
more directly and )'ainly concerned

! nnd cureful sys'em of federal taxation.

sitiou of the Government enhances to
any great extent the value of their
products. And yet for many of the
necessaries and comforts of life, w hich
the most scrupulous economy enables
them to bring into their homes, and for
their implements of husbandry they are
obliged to pay a price largely increased
bv an unnatural nrolit. which hv tlm
action of the Government, is given to the
more favored manufacturers. I recom
mend that, keeping in view all these
considerations, the increasing and un
necessary surplus of national income
annually accumulating, be released to
the people, by an amendment to our
own revenue laws, which shall cheapen
the price of the necessaries of life and
give free entrance to such imported ma
teiials as by American labor may bo
manufactured into marketable commod
ities. Nothing can be accomplished,
however, in the direct'on of this much
needed reform, unless the subject is ap
proached in a patriotic spirit of devotion
to t he interests of the entire country and
! with a willingness to yield something

Is Life
Worth Living ? i
That depends upon the
Liver, for if the Liver ia
inactive the whole sys
tem is out of order the
breath is bad, digestion
oor, head dull or aching,
energy and hopefulness
gone, the spirits are de
pressed, a heavy weight
exists after eating, with
general despondency and
the bluea. The Liver is
the housekeeper of the
health; and a harmless,
pimple remedy that acta
like Nrture, does not
constipate afterwards or
require constant taking,
does not interfere with
business or pleasure dur
ing its use, makes Sim
mons Liver Regulator a
medical perfection.
I have tested its virtues personally, and
know thut Tor Pyfcrx psia, Blllousnesa and
Throbbing Headache, It Is the best medi
cine the world ever saw. Have tried forty
other remedies before Siinmona Liver
Regulator, and none of them pave mor
than temporary relief, but the Kegulatoi
not only relieved but cured.
