I have directed that the estimates for appropriation for the lm-
! provement of coast defenses In tfie United States should be reduced
4: to a minimum, whl'e those for tho completion of the neded fortlflca- -f
tlons at Corregidor In the Philippine Islands and at Pearl Harbor
In the .Hawaiian Islands, should be expedited as much ns possible.
The proposition to make Olongapo and Sublg Bay the naval base for -f
the Pacific was given up and It Is to be treated merely as a supply
4- station, while tho fortifications in
, confined to Corregidor Island and
v -f mand entrance to Manila bay and.
nable from land and sea attack.
transferred to Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands. This necessl-
-fc tates the heavy fortification of the harbor and the establishment of
' an Important military station near Honolulu. I urge that all the es-
tlmates made by the war department for these purposes be approved
by congressional appropriation.

President Taft's message to Con-
' gress was received here this morning
by the steamer China. It contains
a very vigorous recommendation of a
ship subsidy, a lengthy discussion of
China and the state of affairs In the
. Far East, with reference to the Ameri
can - loan of $50,000,000 which is recently-reported
as, in danger owing to.
"oppoltlSm from other powers.. The
tariff Is also discussed at length. The
, following are extracts from the mes
sage: THE SHIP SUBSIDY.

commercial nations recdgnlze the im

Quite aside from the commercial as.

FAR EAST.
Tfhe center of Interest In far eastern
affairs during the past year has again
Deen unina.
It is gratifying to note that the ne
gotiations for a loan to the Chinese
government for the construction of
the trunk railway lines from Hankow
southward to Canton and Westward
through the Yangtse Valley, known as
the Hukuang loan, were concluded by
the representatives of tho various fin.
anclal groups in May last and the re-
suits approved by their respective gov
ernments. The agreement already inl
tlated by the Chinese government, Is
now awaiting formal ratification. The
basis of settlement of the terms of
this loan was one of exact equality bo,
tween America, Franco, Germany and
Great. Britain In respe.ct to furnishing
the" loan and supplying materials for
the proposed railway and their fu
ture branches.

States In regard to tho Huguang loan

tho principle which led to tho pro
