A HOUnKEOTB'S TBOCBLS. I
One day m I wandered I beard a complaining, 4
And taw a poor woman, the picture of gloom.
SUe glared at;the mud on the door-step ('twas ■
raining) !
And this was her wall aa ihe wielded the
broom:
"Oh I life U a toll and loye li a trouble, ]
And beauty will fade and rlchee will flee, |
And pleaaurea they dwindle and price* they
double, i
And nothing li what I eould wish it to be.
"There'i too much of worrlment goes to a bon
net,
There'i too muoh of Ironing goei to a ihlrt,
There'i nothing that payi for the time wasted
on it.
There'i nothing that lasts but trouble and
dirt."
"In March it is mud. it's iluih In December,
And midsummer's breezes are laden with
dust,
In foil the leaves Utter, in muggy September.
The wall-paper rots and the flat-irons rust."
"There are worms In the cherries, and slugs In
the roses,
Andanti in the ingar, and mice in the pies,
The rubbish or spiders, no mortal mppoiei,
And ravaging roaches and damaging flies."
"It'i sweeping at six, and dusting at seven,
It's victuals at eight and dishes at nine,
It's potting and panning from ten to eleven,
Te scarce break our fast ere we plan how .to
dine."

No rest for n day lent the enemy enter,

The President's Message.
The message of President Arthur wan
delivered t<> Congress Us' Tuesday. It
is very long and would fill »bou; 11 col
umns of this naper. I is* s<> long «i»t<
we have not tbe -pace «» .iih. •
full, and bat few would read it if we
did, and therefore we publish the ab
stract, with running commenty, given
editorially by the Bichmond Dispatch
as follows:—
He then proceeds in few and well
chosen words to speak of business mat
ters, Buch as the isthmus canal; the ex
hibitions at Melbourne and Sidney; an
international copy-right law; the con
dition and movements of the Indians.
He gives the Yorktown Centennial a
good notice, mentioning the German as
well as tbe French visitors in fitting
terms. The bi-metallic conference at
Paris receives due notice. Also, the
Electrical Exhibition and Congress in
the same oity.
It seems that our Government has had
some correspondence with Germany
about the natives of Alsace and Lorraine
—the provinces wrested from the French
a few years ago—but as "our views"
seem to have been "accepted," there
need be no fear of trouble with the Em
peror William. It is in this connection
that the President refers to the Von
Steuben family.
Spain still keeps on friendly terms
with Uncle Sam. She will pay what
she owes ns one of these days, notwith
standing a little trouble about one of our
vessels.
The Czar was condoled with on the
death of the late Czar, and he in turn
condoled with the United States on the
death of President Garfield. But these
courtesies have not kept our Govern
ment from trying to protect the Jews in
Russia Especially have American
Jews there been cared for.
The President here refers to Italy.
He says that America was represent
ed at the congresses of Milan, Venice,
and Turin- geographical, beneficentand
hygienic. He asks all discriminating
duties against colonial productions of
Dutch East Indie? to i,e abolished.
He says the American missionaries in
Turkey must be protected,
The Bwiss have selected American of
ficials to act for them in countries where
they have none of their own.
The President protests against persons
who are criminals being sent to this
country a* immigrants home such
have been sent back. He,says we have
made treaties of commerce and naviga.
tion with .Hervia and Roumania.
The United States and Mexico main
tain friendly relations. The latter is
now open to railroads.
Central America shows a pleasant
outsifie.
Our Government seems to have saved
Mexico and Guatemala from a war.
Costa itiea and Colombia have ar
ranged fbr arbitrating their difficulties,
and our Government is looking out to
see that our interests are not overlooked
by tbe arbitrators.
The qu sfios, - growing out of the ca
nal acro-s th> Isthmus-of Panama are
receiving attention from our Govern
ment
Thf Pit- Kent's reference to Br»zi.
ail! i>ui Irailc therewith reads as if there
might be a subsidy behind it Here
come iu several allusions to' South
America countries We U"tf especially
his reference to the war beiweeu Chili,
Bolivia, and Peru. He is anxious for it
to end, and has sent a special envov to
all of them, with general instructions
which may bring about a peace. But
we are not prepared to believe that the
continuance of the war would be "dan
gerous to the interests of republican
governmenton this continent,"or "cal
culated to destroy the best elements of
our peaceful civilization."
Venezuela is complimented. The
President has been looking after her in
terests too. Ours seems to be a "pater
nal government" in one sense at least.
The President here turns to China and
Japan. He refers to the new United
States treaty with China, and makes ap
propriate reference to the opium trade.
He wishes to improve the consular
courts in the whole East. He says Ja
pan is the most advanced of the eastern
nations. How will China like that?
And the President, a Stalwart Radical
and leader of the men who trample un
der foot the Constitution of the United
States, talks glibly about the intentions
of Japan to establish "constitutional
government." But the President means
"constitutional" as in those countries
where there is no written Constitution,
and where the Legislature passes any
lawß it chooses.
King Italakaua comes in for a notice
for himself and his country—Hawaii.
All the European countries are next
mentioned. Also, some of the South
American. "Ecuador is likely to Dlay
an important part among the nations of
the Southern Pacific." What can it be ?
The President recommends legislation
to prevent collisions at sea. He alludes
also to the Geneva convention. He
wants the consular reports to continue
to be published. So do we. They do
not reach people enough, however.
The President mentions the Atlanta
Cotton Exposition; the International
Sanitary Conference; the National
Board of Health; the last has done
good. He has some good remarks upon
the general subject.
The Treasury is in fine plight. Total
receipts, $360,782,292 57. Total ordina
ry expenses, $260,712,887.09. Surplus,
1100,069,404 98.
The President recommends the early
retirement of the silver certificates and
the repeal of the law authorizing their
issue. He says the national banks can
famish paper currency enough. He
recommends that hereafter only so
much silver shall be coined as there is
a currency demand for. Also, that the
issue of gold certificates shall not for
the present be resumed, and that na
tional banks be required to give reaso-
iable notice of their intention to retire
heir circulation.
Just here the President Introduce!
Lome very interesting statistics The
mnual interest on the public debt wat
ast year reduced by 116,826,292.25.
Unless the Windom bonds can be re
minded below 8J per cent., he would
leave them as they are—redeemable al
my time.
The President recommends economy
ind says it is time to reduce the reve
nues ; but alas he sees not Virglnia'i
burthens. He would have all internal
taxes abolished exoept those upon to
bacoo and liqnors and the dealers it
these. Six millions of dollars would
then be collected in Virginia, and nom
In all New England ? Was ever suet
Injustice heard of before? He recom
mends the abolition of the tax upoi
bank capital and their deposits—but th<
hanks must pay the cost of their notes.
He thinks it possible thai soon the taj
on liquors and tobacco may be reduced
Le< ub have it ail taken off tobacco. Nc
compromise. He recommends a com'
mission to revise the tariff. He is verj
cautious in bis utterances on this ques
tion ot a tariff.
The President wants the army in
creased to 80,000 enlisted men.
Rivers and harbors received little at
tention ; fortifications and torpedoes
more. The improvement of the Soutl
Pass of the Mississippi river gets t
word.
The Navy Department next receives
attention, The President is very ear
nest and strong in hisrecommendatiom
of large expenditures ior the navy.
The Poet-Office Department is touch
ed next.
The President professes to desire t«
see punished the Star-Rout® swindlers*
But In Washington it seems to be un
derstood that the wjole influence of tb<
Stalwarts, if not of the Government, ii
thrown in favor oi the accused.
The President wishes the courts of tht
United Stateß increased and the wholt
judicial system reorganized The "Cow
Boys" 01 Arizona come in for a blast it

The report of the Secretary of the In
terior Is reviewed. The President re
commends radical changes in the lawi
as to li'diai'S. He is ritfht. The Mor<

He goes at lengtn into tbe question ol
civil service reform, and discusses it
candidlv. fairly, and intelligently.
He recommends the same protection
to navigation-interests as to manufac
tures.
He asks a Territorial Government for
Alaska.
The last paragraphs of the message
aredevoted to questions connected with
the presidential office, and suggested by
the experience of 1876 and the illness ol
Mr. Garfield.
A Modern Primer.
I
Bee the Lamp-Post. By its Dim
Bays you can behold the Electric
Light across the Street. There is a Man
Leaning against the Lamp-Post. Per
haps the Lamp-Post would Fall if it
Were not For the Man. At any Bate,
the Man would Fall if it were not for
the Lamp-Post. What is the Matter
with the Man ? He appears Disquieted.
He is Trying to Work his Boots up
Through his Mouth. He will have a
Headache to-morrow and Lay it to the
Climate.

The Oirl is Scratching her Back

Buckwheat Cakes. Her Beau thinks

Steady Hen!
Let qb " possess our souls in patience,"
and all will be right sooner than we
expect.
"The bud may have a bitter taste (
But sweet will be the flower."
Just to sure as history repeatß itself,
just so sure as that
"The mill* of the sods grind slowly
But grind exceeding small,"
just bo sure as that he that malioiously
or treacherously "dijtgeth a pit shall
fall into the midst thereof,"just bo sure
ly as "pride goeth before destruction,
and a haughty spirit before a fall," just
so sure will Virginia right herself and
her real people, the democracy, come
back and "spew this new party out of
their mouth." It has suddenly risen
into unparalleled power, it is arrogant,
vindictive, persecuting; it will make a
clean sweep, we trust it may Its
press in the rural districts indicate
their approbation of the doctrine
that to the victors belong the spoils
to the fullest extent, and they
are promising beforehand to cut ripe
and green—make a clean sweep.
Well, we can stand this. We have
stood worse. The present democratic
party stood war and almost famine for
four years—and reconstruction with its
insult and degradation four more. It
has prospered under continued national
' defeat, against the corrupting influences
of federal patronage, under unfriendly
legislation, unconstitutional taxation
and federal exactions, and until this
1 day its solidity became more solid. It
required deception to make a breach.
It required a corrupt coalition to stay
the serried r«nks of intelligence and
property. It required an alliance be
' tween what a majority of the whole
. country calls the worst elements of both
. parties to wrench victory from the
grand party of Virginia that brought
her up from the demoralization of war
' and the desolation of reconstruction un
' der military rule.
Shall we surrender our organization,
our principles or our flag? Never 1
Steady men, all along the line, and
wait for the word.
Boldly, honestly, openly, in Con
* gress, in the Legislature, in your cities
" and counties, in your courts and homes
avow your principies and stick to your
, party. You have a national status, al
' liance and name—you belong to the
' great constitutional, liberty loving
® Democratic party of the United States.
Your friends and brothers—comrades
are in every State and Territory, with
f the banner and the same platform.
Let us be*patient and prudent every
where Make no alliances in the Le
gislature. Vote only for your oWn
f men. Let Republicans take care of
I themselves, and the Read just erg can do
so without your help. Ask nothing.
Don't fret and do foolish things, nor
make foolish threats or promises. They
have succeeded on their explanation of
the Riddleberger bill. Let them pass
it. They have promised office to cor
rupt Republicans—let them comply
? with their promises. They have pro
mised to repeal punishment by stripes
and increase criminal expentes—let
them do it, and be responsible. They
have voted to remove the capitation
prerequisite—let them continue in that
direction till they establish pauper suf
frage. Let them do all they pledged
themselves to do, from abolishing the
i* whipping post to packing the Court of
° Appeals. Only let our representatives
every where make a plain, bold Demo
' cratic record and wait. Meantime let
our intelligent,property holding, Indus

* ocracy—turn their full strength to the
development of the industries of the
" State, to the increase of the trade and

The proceaa is so simple that a child can operate it aa well and aa saeeessfully aa a man. There
