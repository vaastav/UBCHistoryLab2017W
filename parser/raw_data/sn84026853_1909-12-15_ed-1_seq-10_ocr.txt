THEY HEAR TACT1
Customary Presidential Advice Has Been
Delivered
TO SENATE AND HOUSE
The Tenor of the Document Please*
the Republican*, Who Think Its
Recommendations Are a Skillful
Cross Between Fulfillment of the
Pledges and Recommendations.
Congress mot on last Monday and
on Tuesday heard President Taft'u
message read. The formality of
readiLg the menage consumed about
an hour and a half of the time of |
each house. When the conclusion
was reached the house Immediately
adjourned but the senate remained 1
in session for some time afterward, 1
an executive session being held be- '
fore that body adjourned. 1
Little fault was found with the '
message among the Republicans, who i
seemed to agree that it was aa sat- 1
Isfa^tory a document as the Proeident
could prepare and remain consistent
with the party'B campaign i
pledges. The Democrats approved '
of the president's efforts to economize
but deprecated his suggestion i
that tne Monroe doctrine had practically
become obsolete. I
Opposition to the proposed Imme- '
dlsto congressional Investigation of
the sugar Import scandals In tho
New York custom house, and likewise
to any further revision of the '
tariff at present; absence of any
specific recommendation regarding
the crisis In Nicaragua, and actual
recommendation of legislation to for
bid the issuance of Judicial injunctions
without notice in labor controversies,
and for the establishment
of a system of postal savings banks,
may be considered the most striking
features of the first annual message
of President Taft to congress.
The Nlcaraguan question, conservation
of the nation'B natural resources,
needed amendments to the
anti-trust and Interstate commerce
acts, and the contemplated revision
of the federal statutes governing
the organization of the armed forcoe
of the nation in time of war are all
reserved for possible treatment later
in special messages.
In his message which bulks some
17,000 words, Mr. Taft reports the
country to be "In a high state of
prosperity," and he adda that "there
is every reason to believe that we
are on a eve of a substantial business
expansion, and we have Juat
garnered a harvest unexampled to
the market value of agricultural products."
The president expressed entire
confidence 'that the duty Imposed
upon the executive of enforcing tht
maximum rate3 of the new tariff law
against nations unduly discriminating
against the United States will
not provoke any tariff war, and ht
favors no further taniff tinkering
?* iaaut tinrii th<j Tmw tariff com
mission has completed Its work of 1
gathering information as to the reU- 1
tlve cost of producing dutiable articled

two cr three years.

)LD TRAGEDY RECALLED
N"EGRO WAS SENT TO THE PEN
FOR TERRIBLE CRIME.
Ptn Worn by Lexington Man Slain
Trrcntr-wrfo Years A?> Returned
to His Son.
Twenty-seven y&ars ago th# dead
and mangled body of W. 9. Hook
w-Bfl found lying on the Richmond
and Danville Railroad track (now
the Southern), between the llttie
towns of Summit and Gilbert Hollow,
ten mllea from Lexington. A
few days afterwards. Squire Clarke,
a negro, waa arrested, charged with
having killed Hook, and placing bin
body on the railroad track to cover
his terrible crime. For a time the
feeling against the negro ran high,
and aftor two trials he was convict-,
ed and sentenced to serve the balance
of hit life In the State PenlLentlary.
Claike Is said to have protested
hla innocence through thick
and thin, but owing to the fact that
tie bore a bad reputation In the community,
coupled wtth the fact that
be and Hook had bad a railing out
a day or two before, it was believed
that he was the guilty party.
Another thing which worked
against the accused wae that he and
Hook both resided at Gilbert Hollow,
which wae only two miles from
Summit, and both walked the railroad
on the night 1q question. Hook
wae a barkeeper, and ot time, drank
to esceas, it ifl said, and at the time
the negro was tried some of the citizens
belioved that he bad merely
layed down upon the track and weut
to Bleep.
Clarke did not remain in the Penitentiary
long, dying about two years
after being taken there, of consumption.
When death was staring him
in the faee, and when he knew there
was no possible scape, he Is said to
have denied any knowledge of the
killing of the white man.
Four or five weeks ago a lotter
came to Summit, addressed to Mr.
W. % Hook. TLe postmistress, Mrs.
Rhftftlv th? mnthur r>f fMarfr r\t fhr
Court Frank W. Shealy, of Lexington,
delivered the letter to W. 8.
Hook, Jr., who resides In the neighborhood,
not far away. The letter
was from a gentleman In Charleston,
and in the letter was inclosed
a Masonic pin, beoring the inscription
of "W. 8. Hook." Young Hook
ild not know what to think of it at
first, for he himself was not a Mason,
and he at once began to make Inquiry.
He told his friends and relatives
eboot It. To him the finding
of the body of W. 8. Hook on the
railroad track was but a dream.
But there were others who remembered
that terrible tragedy, and it
was learned that the Masonic emblem
waa no other than that which
*aa worn by W. 8. Hok on the night
In which he met his death, but which
was never found.
The sender of the letter stated
that ho had found the pin a few
!aya before at the Union Station ir?
Columbia, and that he took pleasure
In seeding it to Its owner.
It Is now beli^VArf hv manr that
Lhe negro, Equlre Clarke, was convicted
and punished for a crime of
which he was innocent, and finding
the pin may be the means of bringing
to Justloe the parties who committed
the murder?if murder ther"

Tbo following interesting story le 5
reported by a poatoffice official: T
"Use of the malls la resorted to
by artful crook# as a most convenient
way of defrauding the defense
leas public. The chief postofflce in- 1
Bpector and his numerous expert as- ,
siBtanta, stationed in various parts <
of the country, are bu?y at all times
trying to aave the people from being
Illegally separated from their
money. Little doea the public realize
the nature of the schemes employed
to defraud through the maile.
Almost every day the Postmaster
General signs orders depriving in- (
dlvlduale and concerns conducting
businesses to defraud, from further
use of the malls. This is not always
the final disposition of such 1
cases?numbers or tnese loaiviuuaiu
are Bummooed to court, and In man;
Instances after trial, sentenced to |
6erve long terms In the penitentiary.
"Porhaps one of the most unucu*
al schemes to defraud through the
mails wag discovered not long ago. <
After thorough investigation by the
Inspectors It was ultimately suppressed,
but not until after the promoters
had reaped a harvest. The schemes e<
consisted of an appeal to the people
for financial assistance In behalf g
of an armleas girl. For the pur- p
pose of bringing her condition to li
the public attention, Bhe published s'
a booklet and sent it broadcast tl
throughout the country. The booklet
was devoted to a brief history of G
the glrl'B life, detailing an accident e:
by which she had lost both of her tl
arms. Tfoe narratlvo was accom- y
panlcd by Illustrations of the unuau- o
al work she performed with her li
feet. With each booklet mailed n
was encloeed a coin card requesting a
the remittance of 26 cents for the
aame, and a circular letter appealing
to the recipient for money with
which to build a home and get some
good motherly woman to take care G
of it for her. t<
"The investigation made by the 11
Inspector developed the fact that
the armless girl bad entered Into o
a contract with a man, who resided f<
In the same city, to furnish the oapl- o
tal necessary to pnbllsh the booklet, fi
In return the man was to receive, w
and did receive one-half of the set
proceeds deriving from the sale -of si
the booklet. He was first reimbure- s<
ed for the money he had advanced ci
to pay for its publication. ' li
"On his initial visit to the "town n
where the business was being car- w
rled on, the inspector found that the a
enterprise had attained such pro- Vl
portions that the services of eleven ^
persons, in addition to the armless
?irl and her manager, were requlr- I
ed. The girl Informed the inapeo- *?
tor on this visit that at that time fl'
three thousand booklets per day were n
being mailed, that the dally reoelpts aj
amounted to from $86 to $150, and a
[ that the business was steadily In- &
! creasing. She further Informed the <x
Inspector that up to that time she 01
had accumulated as her share of the pi
proceeds more than $10,000. While y<
the representations appearing In the C
booklet respecting the physical oon- w
lltlon of the girl were true, she had
long passed the stage where sh? was tr
dependent upon charity. pi
"When the Inspector was eatlfled lr
that the girl was no longer a sub- ^
ject for charfty, and that her man- et
iger was sharing equally In the proe-eeds,
the subject of depriving them Ul
of further use of the malls waa iak
en up. The Interested parties were w
asked to show why snch on order n<
should be Issued. After appearing cr
qdd commenting to eliminate from
their literature objectionable and "
misleading statements, they were c'
permitted to continue their business. 'D
During the ensuing few months the a?
business dwindled to practically "
nothing and it soon abandoned en- ra
tirely; the elimination of the objectionablo
features from the lltera- m
ture having proved as effective ae 031
the Issuance of a fraud order. ai
"The letter which accompanied
the booklet was a reproduction. A
footnote explained that It was a w
facsimile of a letter written with the
feet of the girl, and that Bhe would
like to write each a personal letter,
but it would bo too much of a ta*k.
On the reverse side of the letter,
what the girl proponed to do with
tb* money derived from the Bale ol Q
tbe booklet was explained and at j
the eame time a little hietory of hm
past was recited. It was stated
that Bhe had not bad mufch experience
in a business way and that her
frlend6 thought ft advlsablo that ^
she have somo one look after her
interest, and that the county court ne
had appointed a man to act as her
trustee.
"The booklet enclosed In add' ru
tlon to giving a detailed history of a
the girl's life, contained many 11- a_
lustrations of the performance of at
marvelous acts with b?r feet, 6noh tj.
as sharpening a pencil, using the jjj
shares, writing, combing her hair. B0

It flung in the face of Southern

Got after Colllwr-s and make
that reckless slanderer of Southern
womanhood take it back and apologize!
The Qeorgian, of Atlanta, Ga.
ddressed the following letter to thiltor
of Collier's Weekly:
Dear Sir. The charge has beei

In due time the editor of Th

While there was nothing further

THE NEW FERTILIZER. I
A discovery of far-reaching Importance
to the farmers of the Boutb Is
the new fertilizer which has been
perfected on one of the Islands near
Charleston, 8. C. It has long been
known that lime Is an essential food
for plants of all kinds and that they
cannot live when It has been exhausted
from the soil. It has also been
known that old worn-out lands are
extremely deficient in lime, and that
sour, badly-drained lands have their
lime la a for mthat Is not usable by
growing crops.
Farmers' Bulletin No. 124, U. 8.
Dept. of Agriculture, aaya: "All
the applications of lime Increased the
yields The best yields were
obtained with (he lime in the form
U1 CUrUUUttlO, tUO uuvijr 0ivuuvi tr~
ter shells standing first * * Lime
with fertilizer was more profitable
than depending upon fertilizer
alone."
This new fertilizer which presents
lime in its most usable form is made
by a new process of burning oyster
shells and using a burner that can
supply potashLV The result Is a high
grade fertilizer costing the consumer
only $7.00 per ton. It reclaims
worn-out lands in' a marvelous manHer
if applied broadcast two months
ahead of amraonlated goods. It's
sweetening effects on sour lands is
almost magical. Charleston freight
rates apply on this new fertilizer.
The factory is located on Young's
Island, S. C., but all letters should
be addressed to E. L. Commlns, Sales
