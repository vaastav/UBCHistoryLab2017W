THE PEANUT POLITICIANS MAD.
The experience in Washington on
j? ?ursday last of the delegation claim?
ing to represent the Virginia and
North Carolina |>eanut dealers before
the ways and means committie tariff
hearing should commend Its dlatln
guished?'hough conglomerate? mem?
bership to the tender sympathies of
all persons.
Comprising a compact amalgamation
Of distinguished representatives of
both .political parties, it was expect?
ed that the assault of this formidable
force would overawe, If it did not com
pletely rout the Democratic membera
of the ways and means committee. I
Doubtless the delegation confidently j
expected to be patted on the bac'i and
feted by the Republicans serving onl
the tariff revision committee.-.
? The presence of Alvah H. Martin cf
Norfolk county, whose uame appears'
la the list of Mr. Taft's cabinet posi
bilities, might reasonably have been1
i depended upon to reft rain Irreverence,
on the part of the Republican mem-j
hers of the committee.
The united prestige of Representa-1
tire* Maynard of the Second and Las-1
etter of the Fourth Virginia congres-|
sional districts, reinforced by such lay j
Democrats as J. P. Holland, of South-1
ampLetn ?ad Colonel C. Fen ton Day, of'
lain of Wight ought to have curbed'
navy Inclination of die minority mem- j
bars of the ways and means committee-:
\ %? submit embarreseing questions, orj
to indulge in merry-making at he ex-1
sense of the Virginia delegation, one
member of which is the dlt-tlnguiah
fc ed father-in law or a very uistinguish
e *i Virginia Democratic statesman.
[ Bat h appears that the inordinate
CjMat of the Virginia peanut men prov
E ?* to be their nemesis. The dealers
k a? the delecatable ground nut who ap
^. Jpssued at Washington in- support ot
H| 300 per cent increase in the taitfT
S- 4stie* upon their product, marshaled

P, tJhat Six oUier Southern Stat.-s are
Tttally interested.
Elaborating the details of the hear
tag carried by the Associated Pre*,
printed in yesterday morning's
tf the Daily Press, the Richmond
Dispatch has the tollowlng from
j*; Ba War hing'on correspondent
'la addition to the three set argn

H. Martin, of Norfolk, and
latlves Maynard. of Virginia.

asked f.r I. R were to continue iimloi
the protective system. In other words
lie sail, he thought the iwanut grower-;
??ntit led to wliat others were getting,
and his appeal was to the Re.mhlt
ea::s fur a square deal.
When asked If he would vote for
the tariff bill now being framed he
declined to answer.
"The witnesses, as a rule, did not
make a g. od Impression, for the rea?
son thai they were rattled on ihe
stand by the cress examinations con
ducted by trained lawyers. Instead
of being i dlgti'tled bearing, 'he affair
was mote of a spectacle, and some ol
those on the \isiting delegation were
very mad when it ?a;t over."
Realizing that It was to laugh, the
representatives of both political pur
ties on the ways and up ins commit?
tee gave vent to their merriment af
the discomfiture of st least one Vir?
ginia congressman anj a wonderfully
aud weirdly personnel* d petitioning
delegation
Who could blame them?
NO AGREEMENT UPON PASSEN
GER RATE.
Owing to the reticence on the pa." j
??f both aides io the conference at
Richmond between the railroad attor?
neys cn the one hand, and the Virgl?
nia Corporation Commkvion and the
attorney general of the State on the
other, i: Is impossible yet to gang1'
the significance of the dissolution of
this conference on Thursday last with?
out an> conclusion h.ivtng been reach?
ed.
If further litikraiton concerning th<'
2 cent passenger rate in Virginia i-si
to be averted, i: must be by an arnica-1
ble agreement between the Corpora
tion Commission and the repreeenta-l
tives of the railroad lines doing busi-i
ness In the State.
Comnetenl autfa rittes disagree asj
to how far -he State Corporation Com?
mission was upheld, or to what <x;< nt
ihe contentions of the transportation
llnes were vindicated in the recent
decision by the I'nited Sta'es Su
preme Court.
The announcement, b. sever, that
the railway attorneys submitted no
definite proposition to the Stale off!
clals would seem to Indicate that th>
railroads believe that it will ultimate?
ly transpire that they have b*-eii au-j
tborized to reinstate the original rates,
ranging from 3 cents a mile upward.
Basing the conclusion upon an ana?
lysis of the meagre infv.rm.aMon so far
given out. it seems altogether proba?
ble that the transportation companies
purpose defying the state authorities
and will fix their passenger rates si b
out regard to the order of the Virgi?
nia Corporation Commissi?-.?. Per?
haps 11.? Immediately, but as a on as
the corporations realize that the State
Commission is irrevocably determined
not to make a practically unconditional
surrentier.
If tile late decision of the I'nited
States Supreme Court be competent
to defeat the decree of the Virginia
Corporation Comaahwion. naturally it
may be depended upon to etera the
wrath of the nevt Virginia legisla?
ture.
IS IT SIGNIFICANT?
It may or may not be significant
that the House of Representatives; in
calling upon the President for evi?
dence upon which he based hi"
charge* that eongrefsmen did not wish
to be sines-teati d by secret service
men. stipulate,! that the President's
reply should treat only of the Sixtieth
Congress.
[ The two representatives, one from
the Senate and one from the House,
who received penitentiary sentences
I for robbing the I'nited States govern?
ment, wen- members of a Congress
which preceded the Sixtieth.
A GAME OF CHANCE.
I A French army officer, detailed for
j that purpose by his government, de
? livered "recently a lecture on the
French army before the United
States Army College, at Newport, and
it 1s rtated that his address was of
material benefit to 'he American of
fleers before whom it was delivered.
He made no Invidious comparisons ot
the French army and others, but 1t
was evident that he believed the
Frtneh rep-ibllc has the lest army in

declared that graft." so fatal to

I iug i f the application,
j The facts as ascertained from relli
. blc autbotitj show that there is no
cau-e for an> alarm In the move. The
j Richmond Locomotive Works were
I chaptered many years ag.> under the
State laws. The laws of 'he State,

chise.
Merged With Trust.
I Sonic years ago the local plan- was
i merged with 'he American Locom?>- j
live Company, chartered under the
laws of the State of New Jersey, and1
since such merger the plant in thisj
I city ?>a; been opt rated under the char.'
: ter of she New Jersey corporation as
! a branch plant. There Is a tax paid
I by foreign i<>r out-of-Statel corpora?
tions, but it is less than the amount
of the franchise tax paid by the local
concern. The application is made,
therefore, for the purpose of escaping
the double taxation which it has been'
paying since the two concerns were
merged. It is purely an economical
I move and one that would appeal to
any business concern.
Other Object of Move.
The object for retaining the char- '
ter for $1.imhi is to provide against ail
contingencies that may arise?such aa '
the sale of the plant to independent
partie-. converting to establishment
for other than locomotive building.
The charter 'or $1,000 will preserve
the individual integrity of the local
Industry, j
There is no reason to believe that
the new move will in any way inter
f< re wi'h the conduct of the plant
in this city. The equipment is no:
be interferred wi'h in any way. I
and the plant will be kept as busy as
l?>s-ib!e when orders are received for
the building of new locomotives or.
for the repairing of others that may .
come to this city.
