CoKaRKSS has much less than three months to work upon
before it expires. Whatever It means to do, had therefore
better be done quickly. One thing it does seem determin
ed to pot through at once the repeal of that provision of
the conscription law allowing persons to put in substitutes.
That provision appears to receive no favor or mercy from
anjbody. The time for putting in substitutes is about
Closed. There wfll be few more offered and still fewer ac
cepted. What course will be adopted in reference to those who
already have substitutes in the ny appears to be rather
difficult to foresee. Tht the recommendation of the Se
cretary of wr to cciicribe the principals, the same S3 if
mo sebstitutes had been oCered or acoepted, will be adopt
ed in all its length and breath, we very much doubt ; and
yet ii this be nor done, we hardly see what else can be dene
with those who have put in substitutes, save to let them go
on their winding way, seeking whom they may speculate
upon, which they too generally da, following the estab
lished order of the day. The substitute clauso was a bad
one from the first and Laa worked badly. Sat tie harm ap
pears to have been done, and the repeal of that clause at
this late day very Euch resembles the act of locking the
stable door after tho horse has made his escape. The num
ber of substitute likely to be ofiered hereafter must be
small in proportion to those which have already been offer
ed and accepted, and have since died or deserted. Indeed
the largest hamber of substitutes cow sought for is proba
bly on the part of those who have served well aEd laith
fally all through the war and are willing to give almost
anything for a chance to be at home to Bee after th.'r d;.
ranged a flairs and neglected families. If any men ought to
be favoured, these men ought, and surely it would seem
hard to refuse them a privilege which bo man; have availed
themselves of to the making of their own fortunes at the
expense of the country. We do not think that any green
substitute is an equivalent for a tried and veteran soldier,
bat the tried ancLveteran soldier who has done brave ser
vice Is entitled to seme privilege, as much at least as the
peculators and others who have done no service, and
these latler have put in substitutes. We would go for
taking the whole lot, past present and future, or else let
ting the thing stand. Treat the substitute buaiccsB as a
dead letter from the first, or let it go on as it is. Don't
make fish of one and flesh of another.
The exemption bill will be a good deal modified, but to
nothing like the extent that would appear to be indicated
by the lecemmendations in the President's message and
the Deport of the Becretary of War. No doubt the ex
emptions under this bill are greatly abused. But some ex
emptions there mart be, and there will be. Tbe attempt
to get along without such would be found difficult if cot
wholly Impossible.
We are glad to see that Congress has passed certain res
olutions of enquiry. We trust that sows dark things may
be made light, and some crooked thing straight, or tolera
bly so, for there are some things that the people do not
" see into" by any means.
Asa matter of course there will be an; number of bills,
projects of bills, schemes, plans and systems introduced
by way of working out the reformation of our currency.
Congress will soon have waded through thee by promptly
referring them to the joint select committee raised to take
the matter uuder consideration, and report 'a bill or bills
for tne action of Congress. -This committee will
hardly report before Christina?, as it is to be supposed that
its members will give to the subject tho maturest and most
careful consideration, and avail themselves of every source
of information within taeir reach, as alsocf the opportuni
ty of consulting with aid obtaining the advice and opinion
of the most experienced financiers. While delay would be
fatal, nndue haste might be eqiail; so, not only failing to
accomplish the good sought for, but even doing harm in
some way not dreamed of nor anticipated.

The Legislature of North Carolina has probably adjourn
ed by this time. We believe it agreed to adopt most of
the recommendations embraced in Gov. Vanos's message.
From all we have been able to hear, there is every indi
cation of a breach, or at least asericui divergence between
the ultra " Conservatives" of the II olden faction and the
Conservative" friends" of Gov. Vance. Of. this thing
more, no doubt, will yet be seen. It has been pretty free
ly talked of in Raleigh, and the fact that the Standard has
coldly allowed Gov. Vance's message to pass by without
even the slightest mention, has not, of coarse, escaped re
mark. " Things is workin."
As we much prefer the position occupied by Governor
Vancs to that occupied by the Standard, cur preposses
sions are of course with Governor Vanck. But then this is
a family quarrel, in which a "destructive," a secesh,"
or a Democrat." (unless he tarns renegade), has nothing
to do or to say Daily Journal, 2ih.
Tex Legislature of North Caroliua has adjourned to meet
on the Sd Tuesday in May next.
Upon the whole the Legislature at its last cesBion showed
less party fern than might have been expected. The 'Con
servatives " were pretty much paralysed by a division or
misunderstanding among themselves. Mr. Avxba, of John
ston cennty, prematurely unmasked his battery, without
waiting for the wagon, and even after a cauoua had been
held the fai'-nful could not be quite brought up to the
scratch, especially as Mr. Ubaham was understood to throw
cold water upon the whole programme.
It is reported that Caasx, Secretary of the Federal
Treasury is to resign and be appointed to the bench of the
Bupreme Cou.t of the United States, from which Judge
Tanxt has resigned. We doubt Ch ass's going oil the bench.
He will want to take a shy at the Presidency.
N. C. Voluntkkb Navt Compart. The address of Eev.
Williamson Hakiis, oa behalf of the above Company, de
livered last night at the Town Hall, was well attended by
an attentive audience, to whom he explained clearly
and satisfactorily its character, aims, objects and
prospects. We are pleased to learn that a favorable
interest baa been drawn to the subject, and that
the prospect of subscription to the stock is quite encour
aging. We regret that we oa'd not attend personally,
having been prevented by a cold of which we thought we
had got clear, but which has ' returned strong," to our
great annoyance. Sach a cold is more like a distemper for
a horse than a disease for a decent christian to have.

Ilia Capture of the Chesapeake.
The capture .of the Yankee steamer Chesapeaka on
her trip from New York to Portland, and off the cele
brated Massachusetts Bay, is certainly one of the most
daring exploits that history or romance has to record.
The last accounts -are that she called off St. John's,
and .look on board Captain Parker, of the privateer
Retribution, who took command. Parker appears to
be the sea name of Captain Locke, who may be re
membered here and in Fayetteville, and who command
ed the Retribution. He is a native jf the British
Provirces, we believe. We rather think eho will make
her mark, if she be at all fitted for the business in
which, no doubt, she is to be employed.

All the account! from the North indicate that Ukadx is
about to be superseded. Borne accounts have it thatGaatrr

while other accounts have it that General Flkasastom is to
take Miade's place. The command of the Army of the
Potomac is Indeed a Golgotha of Generals, and BoatBT .

. Tha Presidents Message
To tbe preEect Eessicn of Congress is by far the the long
est document that Mr. Davis has yet given to tbe world. -
The message is well-written, as are all the productions
of Mr. Davis ; it is firm and patriotic, as was to have been
expected, and yet still it hardly strikes us so favorably as
any of his former messages. It does not satisfy us as they
did. Why ? We can hardly tell, but we know that it does
not. Somehow, although we sgree with mest of his re
commendations, there is wanting that sense of conclusive
ness, of completeness that gives force to argument and con
fidence to conviction. This is only so as contrasted with
(-Mr. Davis' previous efforts, and may be the result of the
great and perhaps necesaarj lengtk of the meaasge, which
imparts to it the appearance of diffuseness, and to the Rea
der the sense of fatigue.
Our Navy In Knglanrl.
In the matter of the iron-clads and other vessels now
under construction in English ship-yards, and alleged to be
intended for the Confederate States, it would appear as
though the English administration wished to evade the re
sponsibility of action and at the same time shrink from the
establishment of a precedent.
The ship Alexandra, alleged to be intended for the Con
federates acd designed, like the Alabama, Florida and
Georgia, ta operate against Yankee commerce, was seized
some months ago on the plea of an alleged violation of the
neutrality laws of Great Britain. The case was tried be
fore a sirgle Judge of the Court of Exchequer, and under
the charge of the Judge, the finding was in favour of the
ship and woojd have secured her release, but that the gev-emmeEt-took
an appeal to the Court in banc, where at the
laat accounts the whole question of the law was being re
argued before all the Jadges. Whether or not they affirm
the ruling of the single Judge before whom the case was
first tiied, the question will not then be ended. If they do,
there still remains the appeal to tbe House of Lords. If
they do not, then the case must again go before a jary to
be tried nnder new instructions. The whole machinery ol
tha law's delay is open and wiil be probably employed to
tide the matter over until its decisica one way or the other
can make little or no difference, and then it will be suffered j
to urop, or at Den aipcEea oi on some siae issue not aueoi
ng the re tin question-
Bach appears to us to be the course pursued by the Brit- j
ish authorities, and in availing themselves ef the law's de-8
lay to detain tlese vessels pending hostilities, they playing
iato the hands of Lincoln and Sbwaed jast as direotly as
if they were to seize and hold them unconditionally. We
have little eaoogh, God knows, to thank foreign nationa
for.
The Charleston papers have announced a further, advance
of their rate of subscriptions, to go into effect on and after

The Army of Tennrsaee.
The Atlanta Conf.deracy ot Tuesday, in its article "from
tbe front," says :
We learn that a c rrespondence which hss been pending
for several days between the President, Gitns. Hardee,
Johnston and Bragg has culminated in au arranged re
orgar izition o' the command of the army above.
(Jen. Joseph E. Johnston ia to take supreme head of af
fairs, with Uen. Bragsc as chief of staff a combination long
Bought by tbe country, and presenting a chenring front to
the future. We have no words to express our delight at so
equitable, popaUr and proper au adjustment of the vexed
problem. With JohnafQn to plan, uuperriie and direct,
and with Bragg to conduot the office details and police of
tbe army, it will restore confidence as it wfll be itself restor
ed. Tbe people and the soldiers will accept this, tardy
tribute to their discerning good sense, with gratitude and
confidence.
How far this can be relied upon w carraotsay. We give
it for what it may be worth, merely adding that the Con
federacg is very careful in regard to the accuracy of its
statements under this 4 'Front" hvad. It would seem to be
an excellent arrargement, but we doubt whether General
Brags could accept the position of Chief at Staff to Gener
al Johnston, or any other General, since that would be de
rogatory to his rank, which is equal to that of General
Johnston, and tne position or uniet of etas, even to a full
General, u certainly not higher than Msjor General.

Impressment Extraordinary.
In accordance with a recommendation of a commit.
teef citizens, cotcurred in by the Commissioners ot
the Town, having in view th obtaiamcnt of provisions
for the people here 'who might otherwise euffar, we learn
that His HoDer, the Mayor, havirjg first rr-ceived the
concurrence and guarantee oX Generals Whiting and
Pickett that provisions bought for this purpose should
not be iiible to impressment or other military inierfe
ence, did, through duly autb9tized agents purchase five
hundred barrels of flour at or in the country rouDd
pbout Salisbury, which flour, bo guaranteed and so pur
chased for a benevolent purpose, on behalf of en iDco--porated
town, has, as we have betn informed this
morning, been seized and impressed by Captain Myer3,
Commissary at Salisbury. We suppose Captain Myers
merely acted eccordhg to his orders as he undes stood
them these orders coming, we tuppose, from tbe Com
missary General at Richmond, a geutltmD caved
Northrop, formerly of Charleston, who has the peculier
faculty and distinguished talent of doin evtrytbirg in
tbe most disagreeable muuLer in which it cau possibly
be dooe, and who has succeeded fu doubling the odium
necessarily atiaebiog to ell imprrss:rents, and intensify-ing-the
public cppositiou to them. If this sort of thing
is carried on charity will be paralyzed, aaJ beuevolence
become a mockery. We must believe that the authori
ties at .the seat of government will see that this tiling
at least is put right.
Northers papers say that another Russian fleet is
expected at New York. If this be true it gives fddi
tioaal color of probability to the reports that Rus3ia is
preparing for w-ir in the SpriDg, and that by ordering
her fleets to winter on this side the Atlantic, phe wishes
to avoid having them cooped up in the Baltic and
Black seas by the combined navies of France and Eng
land, as they were curing the Crimean war. Should
war break out in the Spring an important part of the
Russian fleet wilt be abroad to prey upon Eagiish and
French commerce. ' .

The Encounter Grlwetn Q,uuurcll n.d RSuiif.
A friend, now in Richmond conveisart with the
facts famishes the Sentinel the following account of
the affair between the gallant Colonel Quantrell and
the Yankes Ceneral lilunt :
Ballard House, Dec. 4, 1863.
During the few dajs I have been in jour city I bare
seen several notices in the papers respecting the affair of
Col. Qaantrell and Gen. Blunt, all of which I found to
be incorrect.
A.s I am in possession of the facts of the case re
ceived from Quantrell himself, and corroborated by
many of his tioopi at different times and places, all saj
ing the same thing, it is dno to Qaantrell himself, to
the community, and e.spescially to the interest- of the
Southern cause, that they should be plactd belore tbe
public. They are briefly these :
Qaantrell, with ki3 company and others that bad
joined him, for mutual aid, (300 in all) started in the
latter part of September from the Missouri river in
Kansas, or west part of Missouri, to go to Texas for the
purpose of resting and recruiting his horses ai d other
atocfe. On hti way, about the first ol October, he came
across Fort Baxter, very unexpectedly, as he knew
nothing of its being there. It is situated directly on
the line between the Cherokee nation proper and what
as called tbe neutral lands of that nation, lying within
the claimed boundary of Kansas. Here he Lad a lit
tle brush, iu which he had t wo men killed and five
wounded.
Finding he could do nothing there he drew off ; but
Try soon after, within a mile or two of the fort, he
aaw a conpany of about 150 men comirjg din ctly right
on him. He called to hia m'?n to close up and pn pare
to charge, which they did, cud the Federuj3 piepditd to
receive them. Whea Qmantreh's men were wiihm thirty
yards of them, the Federals fired their pistols at thGm,
but not a eincle shot took effeet. the whole discharge
0 O
f naasirn? over their heads. Quantrell then rushed in.
and the Federals turned and fled, scattering in every
direction, our troops pursuing and killing all they came
up with. It was in a wide open prairie, end tiny soon
s pread over a large space.
The number ot Federals killed is supposed to be about
75 or 100. Quantrell lost one killed and one wounded.
In a contest at the band wagou he kiiled 10. He cap
tured Gen. Blount's carriage, ambulance and a train cf
eight or ten wagons, with supplies of clothing, stores
and arms, with many horses and mules. The wagons,
with many ef the stores, he burnt, bp brought the car
riage, ambulance aad most of tbe arms away. H; also
oaptured Blount's trunk containing many papers, in
cluding his commission ; his sword, knife and guo, all
Yery fine and heavily ornamented with geld ; Desides
ot .er property with Blount's name on it.
Quantrell did not know who he was fighting till it
was all ever, and was then told that Blount was kil.ed
acd supposed it to be true, but did not himself know
the fact. It is not true that he sought him or laid a
trap for him. lie diu not expect Blount ; it was all
accidentally. It is cot true that a yellow boy was all
tliat escaped ; many got away. The above are the true
facts of the case.
Counterfeit Twenties.
M. Guisot, at the Government Depository in Mobile,
has received a letter from the Secretary ot the Treasury,
explaining the trouble in relation to the doubtful
twenty dollars Treasury Eotes. The Mobile Tribute
says :
It seems that several Scotch workmen were brought
from Europe to Columbia for the engraving; establish
ment at that place. Tke&3 men were rogues, and stole
printed copies of the notes, and bad them fiUed up by
persons in the towD, who were in collusion, and reaped
a part of the profits. Tbe whole amount known to have
been fraduleatly issued ia $240,000. It is all stamped
in red, aod the stamp, which is of Government order in
the trae notes, ia ol "Jane, 1863." How much of the
issue of the $20 denomination was made in that month
we do not know ; but we soppose that the $240,000 it
only a email part of it. It ia satisfactory to know that
ail engaged in the businesa have been arrested.

The subject of retaining in service, or discharging at the

FROM THE UNITED STATES LINCOLN'S MESSAGE.
Richmond, Dec. 13th, 1863.
The New York Herald, of the luth, sajs that Lincoln's
message makes five columns. The first part of the messase
is unimportant, and briefly adverts to the maintenance of
tne neutrality ol EBgland and France, the rights of aliens,
and other minor subjects. In regard to the finances it says
the operations of the treasury laat year were successfully
conducted. The receipts trom all source were nine hun
dred and one millions, and the disbursements eight hundred
acd ninety five millions. Lince the emancipation procla
mation was issued, the rebel borders have been pressed
further back by the complete opening of the Mississippi
Tee country dominated by rebellion has been divided into
two distinct parts Tennessee and Arkansas have been
cleared of rnsuigenl control, and influential citizens of
each declare openly for emancipation. - Of those who were
slaves at the beginning of the rebellion a hundred thousand
is now. in the United States military service, who are as
good soldiers as any. The emancipation measure has
improved the tone of public sen iment abroad and at home.
It has been fully discussed, supported and denounced. The
elections, however, have resulted h'ghly encouraging to the
administration. Looking to the resumption of the national
authority .-in rebel States, he issued the proclamation in
which he believes nothing was attempted beyond what is
justified by the Constitution. The-formof oath is given,
but no man coerced to take it, only promised pardon in ease
he voluntarily takes it. The constitutionality and expediency
of the proclamation and accompanying oath is discussed
at Bcme length. Lincoln says while he remains iahis pres
ent position he shall sot attempt to retract or modify his
Emancipation proclamation, nor return to slavery any per
son free by tba terms of thit proclamation, or by any of
the acts of Congress. In the cpneruding paragraph, Lin
coln tiuats Congress will omit no fair opportunity of aiding
these important steps to consummation, but must .not lose
sight of the fact that the war power is still our main re
liance. The p reclamation is appeadedto themwiago.
The preamble-refers to the powers of the President to
grant reprieves and pardons, to the existence of rebellion
and treason In the several States, and to the laws of Con
gress, tbe proclamation of the President confiscating prop
erty aBd liberating slaves, and finally to the desire of some
persons heretofore engaged ia said rebellion to repnme their
allegiance to the United States and reiDauerate loyal
State Governments. He therefore proclaims fall pardon ia
granted to all participants in the rebellion, with the re
storation of their rights in property, except s eves, upon
condition that thsv take tb&oath, the form of which is pre
scribed, to faithfully support the constitution of the United
States and the Union of the States tkereunder ard all acts
of Congress and the proclamations of the President in re
ference to slaves, until modified or declared void. All
prominent officials ef the Confederate Government, officers
in the army above the rank of Colonel aod others, are men
tioned and excepted from the benefit of the pardon He
further proclaims that whenever one-tenth of the qualified
voters of any State in rebellion, after taking said oatbt shall
re-establish the Ktate Government, they shall be reorgan
ized as the true Government of the fctate.
The Herald concludes that Lincoln's plan will be a fail
ure, atd expresses the hope that a discussion of it will lead
to some satisfactory half-way house to rest.
