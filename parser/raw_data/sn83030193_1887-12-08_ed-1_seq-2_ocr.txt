m MR, BLAME'S IDEAS.
fSf Mr. Blaine puts tho cart beforo tho horso
;T- in saying that tho 1'resident favors tho reten-
igs tion of tho internal taxes " in order that tho
K& tariff may be forced down bolow tho fair
ft roTcnno xtaudard."
a Tho President would retain tho remnant of
ij& i tho internal taxes in order that tho nocossl.
jjjk' ties of tho peoplo may bo relieved of war
Sj ' duties that aro no longer required cithor for
ftSt protection or'rovcnue.
Jig- Tbo reduction proposed by the President
jjjJF would leave the tariff higher than it was in
W 18C3-
j ' Wo agrco with Mr. 13laine that tbo internal
$f tax on tobacco should be repealed. This
fffi. coinpromlsu will doubtless be a part of any
iSL hill framed to pass.
Jr. Mr. Dlaine'b adhesion to his old idoa of
;M.; dlstributiui; tho suri'lus among tbo (States
.5fc)., allows an unexpected streak of Bourbonism
jj& in him. The surplus is to bo stoppod, not
SjMjj, Boattered.
Mf A BDLWAEK OF HONOPOUEa
IJjM t 'What aro "trusts" for? To crush com-
$&t pctltiou und raiso prices.
J' What makes "trusts" possible in tbis
Si , country ? Tbo altitudiuous war tariff.
W1 What is tho limit of thoir extortion ? Tho
j sslt-Bamo "vicious" tariff. The higher tho
ife tax on foreign importatious the moro secure
m and inoro profititblo tho monopolies.
A blow at tho war tariff is a blow at tho
SJ9M "trusts."
If POSTAL TELEGRAPH POSSIBILITIES.
JJJ Tho logio of events certninly favors tho
PE postal telegraph. It involves no now priu-
HsW ciple. From mall to telegraph is simply u
HE$ scientific progrcbhiou in method and not a
KfP change of function.
IgIP Trivate enterprise would never havo given
RjjSP ns tho two-cent postago. Monopoly will
eSSL' never bring cheap telegruphy. For a six.
WHE t penco tbo English Ooverumcnt syBtcm sends
Mpi ten words to any part of the British Isles.
W&J A Ten cents ought to carry a Bunilar message to
BSf '" any part of Uiis country.
KS' Telegraphy is in tho infancy of its useful-
M&, ness. Low aud uniform rates would multi-
m&&' Ply tUe business of tho wires.
EH Put tbo civil service on tbo right basis, and
Hw', then postal telegraphy will bo a good thing
yjgj tp talk about.
HP COST AND WORTH.
Kg. ' When it comos to a iiuestion of " worth,"
M ' (Jiero is no doubt that any good newspaper is
B8' worth five cents, and an exceptionally good
BOP, one, like Tiie Would, a dune.
HgLC Tup Sunday Would is well "worth" $1.
Hp, It contains inoro and better reading than a
KmS great many books that sell for that sum.
W And yet if a good newspaper can bo pro-
Pyjjjl'r duccd and sold ut a profit for two cents, or
iflKH?" three cents on Sunday, why shouldn't the
Pt- publlo have the benefit of the .cheapness
Kfl'' warranted by an enormous circulation ?
HsF;;'- It is cost and not worth that fixes prices.
Mm " IT HAS BEEN TOU0HED.
BHr. A foeblo plaint is raised by an Old Whig
Hg. journal, at tho tall of the Democratic pro-
HkM oossivu, to have "tho internal revenue
K touched first."
H Tbo internal rovenuo was touohod first and
H;,i , touched lam.
HJr ( It Lu been hacked and pruned until only
H
two articles are taxed under it tobacco and
spirits. AtiU height, tho internal system
taxed nearly everything movable in the coun
try. It producod at its maximum $300,000,000
a year. Last year it yioldcd but $118,000,000.
But tho tariff is within 1 point of tho
highest war avcrogo. It produced last year
over $30,000,000 moro than at tho close of tbo
war.
Tax luxuries and exempt necessities is the
sound Democratic doctrino laid down fcy tho
President.
"THE WORLD" " MOVES ON."
The WonLi) "moves on" again this timo
on to Washington. A small army of its alert
reporters laid siege to Congress. And it cap
tured what it was after i. e. , tbo opinions of
tho mombers on tho tariff and Presidential
questions.
Homo significant facts were dovclopcd. Tho
Democrats who expressed themselves woro
almost a unit in favor of tho President's
recommendations. A reasonable compromise
measure would probably Bolidify tbo Demo
cratic sido of tne House. Moro Kcpubllcans
favored than Doraocrats opposed Ci.kve
land'b ideas. Tbo outlook for tariff rcfonu
decidedly brightens.
But as for Mr. Blaine, wcll-a-day i it looks
like a political eclipse. Only twenty-ilvo
Blaine Republicans could bo found. Homo
forty wero discreetly non-committal ; seven
teen wero for tho Convention's nominee.

good dcal ' interesting information as it
proceeds.
TWICE COURTED.
Tho Chicago girlwbo has been twioo wooed

of all memory of tho first wooing occasioned
by a serious illness, has had a uuiquo ox.
poriencc.
A great many girls aro twico courtod and
won by tbo Bamo wooor, but it is only a lov
ers' quarrol that intervenes. No well-con-ditionod
young woman over forgets her first
wooing without tho help of a momory-ob-literating
illness.
It is not recorded that tho Chicago young
man objected to doing his work over again.
OUT THE TELEPHONE BATES.
Tho oxtortionato nature of tho Bell mono
poly is very apparent from tho statistics of
tho telephono buslnoss, published for tho
first time in The Wodld this morning.
Out of aggregato earnings of $10,883,800,
tbo subsidiary companies recolvo only 7.CC
per cent, on their allegod capital. Tho
parent company, charging $11 rout on ovory
one of tho 311,070 instruments in use, takes
tho lion's share of tho profits.
Protection to a pateutco docs not justify
extortion. Tho Legislatures havo tho right
to reduce telophono charges to a reasonable
basis, and they should do so. Tho Boll poo
plo should bo satisfied with a fraction of thoir
present enormous income
EXTORTION N0r PROTECTION.
When Mr. Blaine has read tbo full text of
tho President's mobsngu bo will boo that ho
has done Mr. Cleveland an injustice.
Tho Frcsidont docs not object to " permit
ting protection to result f reoly as an incident
to rovenuo duties." IIo expressly sayH that
tbo tariff system " must bo continued," and
and that in ita readjustment " tbo interests
of American labor should bo carefully con
sidered, as well as tho preservation of our
manufactures," though " this may bo callod
protection or by any other name."
It is not incidental protection, but inten
tional aud direct extortion from tbo tax
payers to which tbo tariff reformers object.
It is stated in tho Hun that 1'kteii Mitchell,
" lato of SiiAnr'3 counsel," has been " men.
tionod" in connection with an Assistant
DlBtrlct-Attornoyship, aud ttiat " tho know
ing ones say his chances aro good." Jacoii
Suaup'h chances are generally bolioved to bo
likowlso good for koopiug his liberty.
Tho mau who stole an umbrella from a
podestrian iu City Hall Park tho other day
" will bo back " in flvo years. By Recorder
Suyth'b direction ho spends tho interval in
Sing Sing.
The President recommends just what tho
National Conventions of botli parties solomnly
pledgod tboiUHolves to do, aud forthwith tho
entire Republican press begins to bowl that
he has invited blue ruin upon tho country.
" There aro worwj tilings than a surplus,"
says a journal that 1b filled with inward rago
at tho President's Message. Yes, a war tax
prolonged in tho interest of monopolies is
Morso than tho surplus that it produces.
"No one who dislikes to pay customs
duties is compelled to do to," says n -uur-tariff
organ. No, ho can go to jail for smug,
gling. But bow about sugar ? Can ho get
that of any homo monopoly ?
The Woblb naturally recognizes enter,
prise when it sees it, and it cluorfully con.
cedes that tho Tribune's iuterviow with Mr,
Blaine on tbo President's messago was an
admirablo btroko of work.
Mr. Blaine's idea that " whiskey should
pay for coast defenses " will rank him as a
temperance man among distillers and a
saloonito among tbo Prohibitionibts.
Tire Wobld's regiment of reporters cap.
tured Washington, though othor regiments
have failed. Tho pencil is mightier thou tbo
bayonet.
As a matter of cold fact, every reduction
of the tariff made since tho war has boon fol
lowed by a reduction in tho revenue from
CUBtoniB.
Tho Supremo Court has declared prohibi.
tion to bo constitutional. But even tho Ku
premo Court cannot mako prohibition possi.

If anything less than a 17 per cent, tariff bo
" free trade," this country is going in for
somo frocdom.
K0 FDN TO BE A CZAR.

If adjthlnit coald reconcile the average Ameri

be the late atorr of Mr. Htralcoach to the effect that
Ilia Imperial Maietty once, when Czarowjtch,
Ilaeu a French nbllgalo to the song given bj

become a full-blown Czar, the orchestra affected

Happier Indeed wo.) this great man, with hta
French horn and lila portfolio aa Czarowltch, living

For this rcanun wa ougLt to appreciate, a country

avoid being a Czarina, by beginning In lime, but
when he discovers that hu la a Czurowltch ho

Tho utmost latltudo Is given to an American.
Ho can not only abatuln from being great, bnt after
ho lias been arcat, our people will cxcuio a man
and allow him to Insert himself tutu obscurity

Hut a Czar has do chance. He really baa no fun at
alL Ah soon aa ha dlacovcra that his lineage la
high he la open to criticism, and cannot.do anything

A Czar who would play shortstop In a picked
nlno or go about the country delivering a humor

Tin nit Is dlaagrecabto for a man to bo a Czar
and suddenly find himself tho parent of a Grand
Duke whom ho don't exactly feel at liberty to
spunk I No man really wants to spank a Orand
Duke, no matter bow little ho Is. As Americana,
we do not fully appreciate tbo blessings of

10. VT. ttmaltty in To'VU Trftiin.
Putts, Dec. 7. Attor routing an abstract of tbe
President's message, laid beforo all Europe this
morning, I saw Mr. lllalno and ntkod him If he
would bo willing to giro bla vlewa upon the recom
mendation of the President In tbe form of a letter
or interview. He preferred an Interview, If I
would agree to send him an intelligent shorthand
reporter, wltb such questions aa ahould give free
scope for an expression of bis vlewa. The follow
ing lucid and powerful statement Is tbo rcault.
Mr. lllalne began by aaylng to the reporter:
" I have been reading an abstract of the Presi
dent's message and havo been especially Interested
In the comments of tho Lonuuu papers. Those
papers all assume to declare tbe messago is a free
trade manifesto and evidently aro anticipating an
enlarged market for English fabrics In the United
btatcsasacontcn,uenco of the President's recom
mendations. Perhaps that fact stamped tho char
actor ot tbe messago moro clearly than any words
of inlno ttin."
"You don't mean actual frco trade without
duty J" queried the reiorter.
"No," replied Mr. Dlalue. "Nor do the Lon
don papers mean that. They simply mean that tbo
President has recommended what lu the United
Mates la known as a revenue tariff, rejecting the
protective featuro as an object and not even per
ralttlng protection to result freely as an Incident
to revenue duties."
" I don't know that I qulto comprehend tbat last
point," said the reporter.
"I mean," said Mr. lllalne, " that for the first
time In tho history of tho United mates tho Presi
dent recommends retaining the internal tax in or
der that tne tariff may be forced down even below
tbe fair rovenuo standard. Ho recommends that
the tax on tobacco bo retained, and thus that
many millions annually shall be levied on a do
mestic product which would far better come from
a tariff on foreign fabrics."
THE TOBACCO TAX SHOULD BE UIPIALKD.
"Then do you mean to imply that you would
favor the repeal of tho tobacco tax?"
"Certainly; I mean Just that," said Mr. lllalne.
" I should urjo that It bodono at once, even be
fore the Christmas holidays. It would lu tho first
placo bring great relief to growers ot tobacco all
over the country, and would, moreover, materially
lessen tbe price of tbo arilclo to consumers. To
bacco to millions of men is a necessity. Tho Presi
dent calls It a luxury,, but It Is a luxury In no other
sence than tea and coffee arc luxuries. It Is well
to remember that tbo luxury ot yesterday becomes
a nccesilty ot to-day. Watcb, It yon
please, tbs number of men at work ou
the farm, In the coal mine, along the railroad,
lu tbo Iron foundry, or In any calling, and
you will find OS lu 103 chewing whllo they
work. After each meal tbo same proportion seek
the solace of a plpo or a cigar. Thcso men not
only pay tbo millions of the tobacco tax, but pay
on every plug and every cigar an enhanced prlco
which tho tax onablca the manuraclurcr and
retailer to Impose. Tho only oxcuao for such a tax
Is tho actual neccsalty under which tho Government
found Itself during the war, and tho yeara Imme
diately lollowlng. To retain tho tax now In order
to destroy tbe protection which would Incidentally
flow from raising the earns amount of monoy on
foreign Imports is certainly a most extraordinary
policy for our Government."
T1IK WHISKXr TAX SHOULD BK ltKTAINKD.
" Well, then, Mr. lllalno, would yon advise tbe
repeal of the whlakoy tax also !"
" No, I would not. other considerations than
those of financial administration are to bo taken
Into account with regard to whiskey. There is a
moral aide to It. To cheapen tho price of whiskey
Is to Increase Its consumption enormously. There
would bo no aenao In urging tho reform wrought
by high license In mauy States It the National Gov
ernment neutralizes tho good effect by making
whiskey within reach of every one at 80 cents a
gallon. Whiskey would be everywhere distilled If
tho surveillance of tho Qovermeot woro withdrawn
by tho remission of the tax, and Illicit sales could
not then bo prevented oven by a policy aa rigorous
uud searohlug as that with which liussla pursues
tho Nihilists. It would destroy high liccnso at
once In all tho States.
WHISKEY HIIOVLD PAT 'OB COAST DEFENCES.
'Whiskey has done a vast deal nf hurm In tho
United States. I would try to make it do somo
good. I nould uso tho tax to fortify our cities
on tho soaboird. In view of the powerful letter
addressed to tho Democratic party on the subject
of formications by the late Mr. Samuel J. Tilden,
In lsss, 1 am amazed that no attention has been
paid to the subject by the Democratic Administra
tion. Never beforo In the history of tho world
has any government allowed great cities on the
seaboard, llko New York, Philadelphia, Iloston,
llaltlmore, New Orleans and San Francisco to re
main absolutely defenceless."
IN TUK OK l'EACK t'HErAIIK ton WAIL
"Hut, "said the reporter, "you don't tklnkwo
are to havo war In any direction? "
'Certainly not." aald Mr. lllalne. "Neither, I
presume, did Mr. Tilden when ho wrote his re
markablo letter. Hut wo should change a remoto
chanco Into an absolute Impossibility. Hour weak
and exposed points wero strongly fortlllod. If to
day wo had by any chanco even such a war as we
had with Mexico our enemy conld procuro Iron
clads In Kurope that would meance our great
cities with destruction or lay them under contri
bution." "llut would not our fortifying now possibly look
aa If we expected war? "
" Why should It any moro than tho fortifications
made seventy or eighty years ago by our grand
fathers when they guarded themselves against
successful attack from the armaments of Ibat day?
We don't necessarily expect a burglar because we
lock our d ora at night, but If by any possibility a
burglar comes It contributes vastly to our peace of
mind und our sound sleep to ficl that bo can't
get In."
HOUSES AM) PAnttS TAT TOO MUCH TAX.
" Hut alter tho fortification should be con
structed wonld you still maintain tho tax on
whiskey?"
Yea," aald Mr. lllalne, so long as there Is
whiskey to tax 1 would tax It, and when the Na
tional (lo eminent should have no use for the
money I would divide the tax among tho members
of the Federal Union wltb Ihe specific abject of
lightening the tax ou real estate. Tho houses and
farms of the whole country pay too large a propor
tion of tbe total I axes. If ultimately relief could
be given In that direction It would, In my Judg.
meut, be a wise aud beneficent policy. Some
honest but misguided friends of temperance bavo
urged tbat the Government sbonld not use the
money derived from the tax on whiskey. My reply
la that the tax on whiskey by tbe Federal Govern
meut, with Ita suppression of all Illicit dUtUlallou
aud conseqent enhancement of price, has been a
powerful agent In tbe temperance reform by put
ting It beyond the reach of so many. Tho amount
of whiskey consumed In tho Untied States per
capita to-day la not more than 10 per cent, of that
consumed thirty yeara ago, "
Ileslde your general and awceplog opposition
to the President's recommendation, havo you any
further specifio objection ?"
Yea," answered Mr. lllalno; "I sbonld
seriously object to tbe repeal of ihe duty on wool.
To repeal that wonld work great Injustice to many
Interests and wonld aerlously dlscourago what we
should earnestly encourage, namely, the sheep
culture among farmers throughout tho Union. To
breakdown wool-growing and be dependent on
foreign countries for the blanket under wbtcb we
steep and the coat that covers onr backs, Is not a
wise policy for the National Government to en
force," TUE OLD BUOABOO.
" Do you think It the President'-1 recommenda
tion waa adopted It wonld Increase onr export
trade ?"
" Possibly In somo few articles o( pccular con
struction It might, but It would Increase our Im
port trade tenfold as much In the great staple fab
rics, In woollen and cotton goods, In Iron, In Btcel,
lu all tho thousand undone shspia In which tner
are wrought. How are we to export staple fabrics
to the markets of Kurope unless we make them
cheaper than they do In Europe, and how are we
to manufacture Ihcm cheaper than they do in
Kurope, unless we get cheaper labor than they
havo lu Kurope "''
Then you think that tbe question of labor un
denies tho whole aubject ?" " Of course It docs, "
replied Mr. Illalifr. "It Is, In fact, the entlro
question. Whenever wo can force carpenters,
masons, Ironworkers and mechanic la every de
partment to work as cheaply and live aa poorly In
tho United states aa similar workmen In Kurope,
wecuu, of course, manufacture Just ss cheaply as
they do In Kugland and France. Uut I am totally
oppossd to a policy that would entail such re
suits. To attempt It U equivalent to a social and
financial revolution, one that would bring untold
distress."
" Yea, but might not the groat farming class be
benefited by Importing articles from Kuropo In
stead of buying them at higher price at home?"
"Tho moment, " answered Mr. lllalne, "yon
begin to Import freely from Knrope you drivo our
own workmen from mechanical and manufactur
ing pursuits. In the same proportion they become
tillers of tbo soil, increasing steadily the agri
cultural product and decreasing steadily tho largo
home demand which Is coustantly enlarging as
homo manufacturers enlarge. That ot course,
works great Injury to the farmer, glutting the
market with his products and tending constantly
to lower prlcers."
TKYINM TO 8CAKE THE KAHVBHS.
" Yes, but the foreign demand for faipi products
would be increased lu like ratio, .would it nut?"
" Even supposo It were," said .Mr. Dlalue, "how
do you know tho source from which It will bo sup
plied. Tho tendency lu liussla to-day und in tho
Aslatlo possessions of Kngland Is toward a large
Increase of tho grain supply, tho grain being raised
by tho cheapest possible labor. Manufactnrlng
countries will buy tbclr brcadstuffs wbcro they can
get them cheapest, and tho enlarging of the borne
market for the American farmer being chocked, he
would Bturcli In vain for onoot the tamo value..
Ills foreign sales aro already checked by tho treat
competition abroad. There never was a time when
the incrcaso of a largo home market was so valu
ublc to htm. The best proof la that tho farmers are
prosperous In proportion to, tho nearness of mauu
fucturing centres, uud uproteotlro taillf tends to
Bprcad manufactures. In Ohio and Indiana, for
examplo, though not classed as manufacturing
States, tho annual value of fabrics Is larger than
tho annual value of agricultural products."
At this point Mr. Illnlnc entered Into an explana
tion of tho low tariff of lWOaad Us results, claim
ing that Its temporary Illusory prosperity was fol
lowed by ycurs of depression und distress. "It
Is remarkable, " said Mr. lllalne, "that President
Folk recommendod tho tariff of IMS on precisely
the same ground that President Cleveland recom
mends a similar enactment now, namely, the sur
plus In tho Treasury was menacing tbo prosperity
of tbo country. History Is repeating Itself. "
nE WOULD HAKE NO CHANGE.
Tho Interview continues:
11 Do you mean to imply that thcro Bhould bo no
reduction of tho national revenue?"
"No, what I have said Implies tho reverse. I
would rcdnce It by a prompt repeal of tbe tobacco
tax, and would mako hero and there somo changes
lu tho tariff not to reduce protection, but wisely
foster It."
"Would you explain j onr moaning moro fully?"
"I moan," said Mr. lllalne, "that no great
system of revenue llko our tariff can operate with
cfilclene and equity nnlcrs tho changea of trade
bo closely watched and tho law promptly adapted
to those changes. But I would make no change
that Bhould Impair Iho protective character of the
whole body ot tho tariff laws. Four years ago. In
the act of 1S.-U, wo made changea of tbe churacter
I have tried to Indicate. If each changes were
made, and tho fortification of'our Beacoast thus
undertaken at a very moderate annnsl outlay, no
aurplua would be found after that already accumu
lated had been disposed of. Tho outlay of money
on fortifications, whtlo doing great service to the
country, would give good work to many men."
" Hut what about tho existing Buiplus?"
' Tho abstract of tho messago I have seen, "re
plied Mr. Dlalue, "contains no reference to that
point. I,' therefore, mako no comment further
than to indorse Mr. Fred Grant's remark that a
Burplus Is ulwaj s easier to handle than a deficit. "
1'OSSIBLK EFFECT OP TUE I'HESIDENT'S POLICY.
Tho reporter repeated the question whether the
President's recommendation would not, If adopted,
give us the udvantage of a large incrcaso in ex
ports, ' I only repeat," answered Mr. Blslno, "that it
would vastly enlurgo our Imports, whllo tho only
export It would seriously Increase would be our
gold and Bllvcr. Teat would How out bounteously,
just aa It did under the tariff of 1S-1C TbePresl
dent's recommendation enacted Into law would re
sult, as did an experiment In dralnago of a man
who wl.hcd.to turn n swamp Into a productive
field. He dug a drain to a neighboring river, but
It happened, unfortunately, that tho level ot tho
river was higher than tho level ot the swamp. Tbe
couscqueuco need not bo told. A parallel would
bo found when tho Picsidcnt's policy In attempt
ing to open u channel lor an Incrcaso of exports
should simply succeed In making way tor a delug
ing luilow of fabrics to tho destruction of borne In
dustry."
Ol'lt OWN MAllKKT FOB OUR OWN l'EOPLX.
' Hut don't you think It Important to Increase
our export trade?"
"Undoubtedly; but It Is vastly more Important
not to loso our own great market for our own
people In tho vain effort to reach tho Impossible.
It Is nut our foreign trado that haa caused the
wonderful growth and expansion of tho ltcpubllc
It Is tho vast domestic trade between thlrty-clgbt
States and o ght Territories, with their population
uf, perhaps, cs,000,ooo to-day, Tbe wbolo amount
ot our export and Import trade together has never,
I think, reached $1,900, 000, ouo any ono year. Our
lutcrual home trado on 180,000 miles of railway,
along 10,000 inles of ocean coast, ovir tbe five
great lakes and along S0,000 miles of navigable
rivers, rcucht a tho enormous annual aggregate of
more than 10,000,000,000, and perhaps this year
W,0tO, 000,0001.
ILLIMITABLE FllEB T1IADE AT HOME.
" It Is Into this Illimitable trade, even now In Its
Infancy and destined to attain a magnitude not
dreamed of twenty years ago, that the Europeans
are struggling to enter. It Is the berllagoof the
American people, of their children and their chil
dren's children. It gives an absolutely free trade
over a territory nearly as large as all Europe,, and
tbe profit Is all our own. Tbo genuine free
trader appears unable lo seo or comprehend that
this con'lmntal trade not our exchanges wltb
Kurope is the great source of onr prosperity.
President Cleveland now plainly proposes a policy
tbat will admit, Europe to a share of this trade. "
A NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY NEEDED.
" Hut yon are In favor of extending ouf-Corelgn
trade, are you not?"
" Certainly I am, la all practical and advantagc
ous ways, but not on tbe principle of the free
traders, by which wo snail bo constantly exnbang.
log dollar for dime. Moreover, tho foreign trade Is
often very delusive. Cotton Is manufacturcd'ln the
city of my residence. If a box of cotton goods la
sent 2C0 miles to tbo Province of New llrunswlck,
It la foreign trade. If shipped U.ooo mllca round
Cape Horn to Washington Territory It Is domestic
rado. Tbe magnitude ol tie Union and tbe Int.
SSMmtmmWrnMSmm
menaity of its Internal trade require a new political
economy. The treatises written for European
flutes do not grasp our peculiar situation. "
THINKS TUB f OUT II NEEDS rROTEOTtCN.
"How will the President's mes.agj bo taken In
the South?" " 1 don't daro to answer that ques
tion. Tbe truth hai been so long obscured by cer
tain local qucatlons of unreasoning prejudice that
nobody can hope for Industrial enlightenment
among thoir leaders Just yet. Ilut in my view tho
South above all sections ofthuUiilon needs a pro
tective tariff. The two Virginias, North Carolina,
Kentucky, Mlasourl, Tenncstcc, Alabama and
Georgia have enormona rcaonrccs and facilities for
developing and handling manufactures. They
cannot do anything without pro'cctlon. Even
progress so vastus somo of thcso Mates have made
will be checked If the Prts'.deut's message Is en
acted Into law. Their Senators and Kcprcsenta
tlves can prevent It, but they are so used to follow
ing anything labelled ' Democratlo ' that very prob
ably they will follow the 1'reBldent and blight tho
progress already msdo. By the time some of the
Southern Statca get free Iron ore and coal, while
tobacco la taxed, they may havo occasion to alt
down und calculate tho valuo of Democratic tree
trade to their local Interests. "
THE FALLACY OF ADUITTINO RAW MATERIAL.
" Will not the President's recommendation to
admit ruw material find strong support?"
"Not by wise protectionists In uur time. Per
haps aomo greedy mannfatturers may think that
with f re coal or free iron ore they can do great
things, but If they should succeed In trying will,
as the boys say, catch it on the rebound. If the
home trade lu raw material is destroyed or seri
ously Injured railroads will bo the first to feci It.
It tbat vast Interest Is crippled In any direction tho
financial fabrto of the whole country wil feel It
quickly and seriously. If any man can give area
son why we should arrange tho tariff to favor the
raw material of other countries In a competition
agulnat our material of the same kind, I Bhould
like to bear It. bhould that recommendation of
tho President be approved it w'ould turn 100,000
American laborers out of employment before It
bad been a year In operation. "
A FULL AND FAIR CONTEST ON TnE ISSUE.
" What must be the marked and general effect
of the President's message ?"
"It will bring the country where It ought to be
brought to a lull and fair contest on the question
of protection. Tho President himself, makes It
tbo ono Issue by presenting no other In his mes
sage, l think It well to have the question settled.
The Democratic party in power Is a standing men
ace to the Industrial prosperity of tho country.
That menace should bo removed or tho rollcy It
foreshadows should be mado certain. Nothing Is
so mischievous to business as uncertainty, nothing
bo paralyzing us doubt. "

Appropos of that effort on tho part of tho
exocutivo officers of tho Musical, Union to put
a ttoji to tho oompetitlouof tho onlistod naval
aud army musicians with tho citizen inusi.
einns, a great deal of discussion has since
arisen, and musicians all over tbe country

becomo of such serious importanco that it
has Ixh'Ii taken in hand by tho National
Leuguo of Musicians, nnd that "body will en
deavor, through regularly appointed dele,
gates, to bring tho matter beforo Congress
at the present session with a viow toward ob
taining such legislation as will put on end to
tho competition complained of.
A prominent member of tho Musical Union,
who was ou tho Executivo Board when the
Newport affair came up and who was also a
delegate to tho National Lcaguo Convention,
held last March in Chicago, said to a World
reporter to-day:
" It is not so much about tho moro employ,
ment of the military and naval bands that we
complain, but tbo fact tbat they play at rates
much bolow those of tbo citizen musicians.
Tbis cutting undor our figures by men who
aro in tbo employ of tho Government and
who aro fed and clothed nnd sheltered out of
the funds paid in taxes by tiio oitizons has
become intolerable and must bo stopped by
somo means.

"Tho Fort Hamilton Military Band has
also tilled many private and publio en
gagements at rates below thoso
which wo can afford to play for.
"Tho United States Army Military Depot
Band at David's Island also has been putting
in its timo and musio to the disadvantage of
our members.
"Bandmaster Fred ter Linden, now at
West Point, led tho David's Island Baud on

employed the West Point Band in -performing
at publio and privato places, notably last
October during tbo firemen's parade at
Yonkcrs.
" The Government authorities permit this
sort of competition in ordor to increase the
pay of the army and navy musicians, who ro
ceivo but small pay "from tho Government.
" At West Point a first-class musician gets
$34 a month and ono ration a day ; second
class, $20 and n ration, und third-class, $17

not an enlisted man.
" Men of other professions, trades and vari

Frank L. Pcrley, Low Dockstader's new

shoulders when ho advertised for a musical
prodigy. Since Mr. Pcrley's desire has been
known tho highways and tho byoways have
swarmed with prodigies, and " a plague of

of frogs and locusts have been threatened.
Mr. Perlcy devoted himself yesterday to
