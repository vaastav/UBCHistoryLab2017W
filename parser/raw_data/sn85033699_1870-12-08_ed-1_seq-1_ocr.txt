porter Writes anotner Letter.
Admiral Porter has written a letter to
the President concerning the letter pur
porting to have been written by hiun in
18G5 to Gideon Wtlls, the Secretary of
tho Naw. Porter's letter is dated Dec
8, and says his first impulse was to
im to ihu President and pronounce
tho letttx n fabrication, as neither
hlmwJf nor his Secretary could
remember anv such document. He then
nisrtii nn thi failure to remember.
.ftpr whir.h ho reflects severely on the
character of a man who for mischievous
nnmoses would uublisa a private letter
He then grcs on to say that at the time
this letter is dated be was very much an
nnvpl at the failure of the attack on
Fort Fisher, and hansed by the cares
and rtsponoibilitics of commanding his
fleet on a dangerous coast. The gist of
thn h-ttpr is in the fullowinc paractaplis:
"It was under such excitement that, I
TirPAimip. T wrote the letter which vou
has made vou lose vour faith in hu

Mr. Conkling on tho lattcr's efforts to

souri, whereupon the Vice President was
as quickly congratulated on tbe result in
Indiana. Neither Mr. Trumbull nor Mr.

on tho Senate Committees.

NEW ORLEANS RACES.
An ld Nashville Homo Win the
Four Itt.il e Ence.
We have already given from day to
day a telegraphic account ot the races
over the Metairo course last week. On
Saturday the last day, there was a four
mile race, which was won by Donovan, an
old Nashville horse, who was just as good
at pulling a dray as he was in occasion
allv surprising his friends on the turf.
The New Orleans Times thus refers to
the race:
The great event of the meeting, the
four-mile heats, was now in order, but
although great hopes of sport had been
indulged in, the seeming inequality of the
horses destroyed the interest which would
otherwise have been felt. Tho laurel was
of course so generally conceded to the
mare, that few were found mad enough
to invest at even the most tempting odds.
A misunderstanding, by which Captain
Jinks had been shut out from competing,
formed the staple of conversation upon
the tracS, and was generally regretted, as
it was thought the Captain would have
"mixed things" for the favorite, and ren
dred the race much more exciting than
it now promised to be. As the event
proved, however, all these speculations
were at fault ; but then nothing is more
uncertain than a horse race, except a
woman's humor. When the horses were
rung up all appeared in fine condition,
but did not exhibit those splendid points
and mettle which give assurance to oacs-

era in such a heavy race as four-mile
heats.
At tho tap all got off well together,
with Donovan in the lead, Chalmette sec
ond, and the mate last. On the turn all
pulled up, and amid the derisive shouts of
the spectators cantered round to the neaa
of ihehome stretch in a hand gallop, pass
ing the quarter in the magnificent time of
43, and the half in 1:34. Entering the
home run, they all mended their pace, but
even then only gOtly ambled past the
score in 3:07, catching a severe reprimand
from Judge Breaux as they went by. This
seemed to waken them up, and they
entered the second mile with tha marc and
Donovan neck and neck, Chalmette bring
ing up the rear. On the back stretch Sue
drew in front, but Donovan, who exhi
bited good staying qualities, hung on, lap
ping her under the string. Entering the
third mile, Chalmette made a desperate
struggle, but fell short, Donovan snatch
ing the lead on the home stretch, which
he held round, by the score in 7:23, close
ly pressed by the mare. On the back
Etretch in this the fourth mile, bue mauc
another dash for te honor, but could not
reach; again Ehe essayed it, and yet again.
The horse succeeded each time in shaking'
her off, and came home winner of the
heat in the splendid time of 9:10i, Sue
second, Chalmette third; many gentlemen,
in profound disjustatthc space scored,
signifying their intention of bringing
down matrasses and pillows for the next
race, ana entering nret class roenng norses
as competitors.
Notwithstanding the fact that the mare
was plainly outfooted on the home run,
she still reigned favorite at about even,
some bets being maue upon ner at enmu
siastic odds. The knowing ones, how
ever, were disposed to hedge and before the
bell sounded Donovan had the call, at
small odds.
It was now just beginning to grow
dark, and the race had assumed such an
interesting phase, that tho horses went
off for the second heat amid great enthu
siasm. Donovan had the track, but was
ran trht at the turn by Chalmette, who
took the lead, by the quarter in 30. Sue
now made play, caught the great hurdler
at the half in C9, and led round under
the string in 1:57, Donovan second,
Chalmette last. EnteringShc second mile
all bunched, but Sue drew out gradually
daylight in her rear, down to the home
stretch, where all closed again. Donovan
forcing the pace again outfooted the
mare, passing under the string a neck
ahead in 3:51. Sue now done her level
best, going up and making a beautiful
straggle all the way round, and under the
string in 5:401, but entering the fourth
mile evinced 8ign3 ct distress, wonovan
took the front nnd led round to the score
an easy winner in 7:45J, Sue Dougherty
second, and Chalmette distanced.

Flagship Malvkbn, Cats Fbae Rivee,
Jan. 21, 1865. My Dear Sir: I received
your land letter of" the 17th inst, and
thank you warmly for the-confidence you
repojed in my good opinion that thia
placp could be taken. To the Navy De
partment alono is the country indebted
for the capture of this rebel stronghold;
for had it not been for your perseverance
in keeping the fleet here, and your con
stant propositions made to the army,,
nothing would have been done. Aa it
was, after the proposition had been re
ceived, and Gen. Grant promised that
troop3 should be sent, it was not done un
til Gen. Butler consented to let the matter
go on, and when he hoped to reap some
little credit for the explosion of the
powder boat Now, the country gives
Gen. Grant the credit of inaugurat
ing the expedition, when, on both occa
sions, he permitted it to go improperly
provided. In the first place it had neither
head nor tail as far as the army was con
cerned. In the seeond place he (Grant)
sent too few men, when he ought to have
calculated that the Rebels would have
more strongly defended the works, after
seeing what a narrow escape they had.
Nothing but the most desperate, lighting

the army gave us tne viciory. ine gal
lant band of sailors who fearlessly went
into the works amidst a shower of can
nister and bullets, drew the enemy's at
tention away from the a?saulton the land
side, and enabled the troops to obtain a
secure footing. I don't say this to de
tract from the gallantry of the soldiers,
for never did men fight harder or more
handsemely than did our troops that
day. Now that the most important fort
on the coast has been gained, as
usual ycu will hear but little of what the
navy did, and no doubt efforts will be
made again to show that the work was
"not substantially injured as a dsfensive
work." To Gen. Grant, who 13 always
willing to take the credit when anything
is done, and equally ready to lay the
blame of the failure on the navy, when
a failure takes place, f feel under no obli
gations for receiving and allowing a re
port to be spread from hi3 headquarters
that there were tbree days wherrthe navy
might have operated and didliot. He
knows as much about It a he diu when he
wrntp. to me. savinz "the only way iu
which the place could be taken was by
running the ships past the batteries, "show-inn-
pvidentlv that he had not studied the
hydrography of Cape Fear River, and did
not Know the virtue there was in our
wooden walls when they went in for a
fair stand-np fight. Any foit in rebeldoia
can be taken if wc can only get in reachnf ir.
I have served with the Lieutenant General
before, where I never worked so hard in
my life to make a man succeed as I did
for him. You will scarcely notice in his
reports that the navy did him any ser
vice, when without the htlp it has given
him all the way through, he never would
havo been Llcuterwit General. Ho wants
magnanimity, like most officers of the
armv nnd ii ea avaricious 03 reirards
fame that I13 will never, if he can help.
it, do justice to our department. i hen
the Rebels write the history of this war,
then, and only then, will the country be
made to leel what tne navy nas uoue.
T An tint fppl nt all landlv toward GtU.
Grant for the indifference he displayed
in this matter until he found his own re
putation at stake; then he was glad to
throw the elephant overboard that had
weighed him down so heavily. He could
not help but know that Gen. Butler was
going in command of this expedition.
The matter was constantly discussed with
him; ho knew that he had placed himself
and all of his numerous staff on board
the fhgship Bza de Ford, and everybody
spoke of him as commander of the troops.
In a conversitionith Gen. Grant, I

to do with Gen. Butler, and he promised
me faithfully that he should not have any
connection with the expedition. Two
montlis I waited, the fleet ready to sail at
an hour's notice, and I acquiesced in the
General's decision that he could not spare
troops for fear of endangering the de
fences in his front. I said, "Then tbe

Butler said go, wc wenfe The fear of
weakening the defences "disappeared on
Butler's presenting his plan for blowing
the forts down, and an army

on the transports, that they almost sailed
in the middle of a heavy gale. Gen.
Grant knew that I did not care a fig for
tho powder boat, though I was very wil
ling to try it as an experiment, but not
disposed to trust it altogether. I think it
most unhandsome in him to listen for a
moment to the idle talk of Butler's staff,
and his timid, calculating engineer, Corn

The Memphis Appeal of the 6th inst.
says: "The finest residence in the btate
is the new house built by John M. Lea,
in Nashville, the material of which, save
the glass and point, was entirely procured
ip the Stat. It eost ono hundred then
ted dollar?.
The custom, long as it has prevailed in
tlioSouth,of changing residences on tho pai t
of tenants on tho first of January, subject
ing them to the rigorous inclemencies of
mid-winter, is a very inconvenient one, and
should, if possible, without disturbing the
relationships between them and property
owners, bo changed to a milder season of
the year. These relationships are of a
very important character, involving the
equilibiium of capital and labor, tho
safe investiture of means in improvement,
the comfort and encouragement of a very
largo and nseful class of population, and
tho general prosperity of tbo city a3 well;
they should bo so arranged and regulated
as to be mutually protective, profitable and
agroeable.
Tho first of January, thon, being the
time when tho changes of tenantry will
take place, as heretofore, and but few
weeks intervening when that time is upon
us, we propose offering a few practical Re
marks upon tho subject of Ttnt), as. being
pertinent to the season, and of general in
terest to all classes of our city readers.
Appreciating the importance of tha snh
ject, we havo given to it moro than ordi
nary attention, and although onr investi
gations have led na into its details, our (re
marks will be of a general character. ,
In no city in the country, with, perhaps,
the single exception of Atlanta, Gi., have
' rents been less filed by established rules,
and regulated by settled prices than in
Nashville during thelasf ten years. This
hisa licwm nwinn in rwrf. in tha mr whfph
disturbed everything, individual as well aa
social economy, immediately alter tne
war property went up to fictitious values,
attributable in part to the depreciation
of tho currency of the country,
and in part to the great expectations
ofTJtopiin dreamers. For tho year 1SGG
rents were very high, and all kinds of lesi
dences and storerooms in active demand.
For 1607 they were fluctuating andna
steady, owiog to tho feverish and unsottled
condition of our social and political sur
roundings. For tho year 1808 the aggre
gate of rents were high and disproportion
ate to assessed valuation of property and
the taxes upon tho same. Large houses
thti were thon rented for $2,000 could
now bo procured for $1,500. In 1SG9, or
f jr that year, rents became more sottled,
but weie still, especially for tho larger
class of homes, too high. And yet, at thj
close of that year, property owners, un
fortunately for themselves and tenants,
looked forward to 1870 for higher rent.
Wa Vrmr nf ft nnmhnr nf families, com
posing, too, those of our best citizens, who
removed from houses they had long occu
pied on account of this increased dennnd.
What was the result? The same houses
remained no inconsiderable part of
the present year, just closing, unoc
pnnioil ami when thav wore rented it was
at less figures than the former occupants
had paid, and we can point to some of the
very houses to-day Libeled "for rent," and
which could be had at much lower figures
thin were offered by good tenants one year
ago in preference to the annoyance of re
moval, and which wa3 refused. These re
marks have more especial reference to the
1 lrger sized, centrally located residence'!.
1 thU the part of wisdom? Will the ex
periment of 1800 be repeated at the close
of 1870? Just hero we vontura a few words
to property owners. We desire that they
get all they can for their property, but at
tho same time wo kindly suggest ihat they
look well to it that thoy do not, in asking
too much, 10S3 wnat tney migui actoauj
get and what tenants aro able and willing
to pay. Let it be borne in mind that tha
swift-footed Godess Atalanta lost the race
becauso she stopped to gtther golden ap
ples. It is a fallacious rale to graduato
rents according to the cost of bnildingi
and property, which when improved
or purchased, may have involved
exorbitant sums. Such a rnlo may excludo
good and prompt paying tenants. Itstlect
if the prosont valuo of your house be $10,
nnn n nh1 r.f Si .001 !irinp VOU 10 ner
cent and so on in the same ratio for honsts
valued at sums mora or less than $10,000,
and 10 per cent is more than jour legal
rato of Interest. This euhject of rente m
valves tho prosperity of" the city: it in
volves the price cf labor; it involves the
prico of articles of daily consumption; it
involves tho mdncemonU of hundreds to
locate in our midst, and it involves tho
success of the well-to-do man of business,
with a family and but moderate means, or
but a moderate income from his avocation
or his profession, as well as the interests of
the laboring man and the mechanic They
each and all have to graduate tleir mode
of living to tno income oi uiou mwu.
Tho rising man of business with a family,
much as ho would lovo the sweots
of a homo will resort to boarding,
or be driven from&the city before he
can pay rents beyono? what i3 justified
by his income. It is not well that those
who have means invested in good houses
should let them remain empty and thoso
.r,a eiiei iiApAnsn the. risht class of
tenents cannot afford to come up to their
figures. Tho outlook of the property hold
er should be broader and more embracivo
than one of purely selfish interest. He,
who comfortably ensconced in his mansion,
keeps hanging in view the keys of vacant
houses, the inner walls of which are be
coming mildewed and filled with cobwebs,
and tho hinges of whose pannelled doors
are rusting away, refusing offered rents,
reasonable to the times, proportioned to
values, and to the means of good tenants,
is no wiser than the snail in the Hindoo
maxim that sees nothing but its own shell
and thinks it the grandest palace in the
universe. , . ,
The large nnmber o .he class
of houses refered to- ior rem
thronghont the city makes these-remarks
ominently suggestive and timely

This is the renting season. Now, if ever,
this das3 of houses are to be rented for
187 1. The rents on this class of houses
has a "tendency decidedly downward. This
.. : ; namltncci ta disauise. A no ue-
mand for such houses is not so great as it
was one and two years ago, and of course,
the price must be proportionate to the de
mand. Those owning this class of houses
would act wisely by availing themselves of
the first reasonable offer to secure good
tenants.
This view of the case will be fully ap
preciated when we state from unquestion
ed observation, that there are now in the
city and in Edgefield over four hundred
houses for rent, and that an unusually
large proportion of them are the kind of
houses indicated.
Let it not bo argued from this that thsro
is a falling oK of business, a decrease of
population. Far from it. Many persons
in thn Knhurba or to tho
uavo wiuuiou "
country who do business here, to avoid
hi" h rents and hundreds are boarding from
.. Ao Toimrrifl the class
of houses we have b-jen consider
inc, those that rented for $1,200 last year,
can benow had fori,000; those that rented
for $1,400, at $1,200, and so on with few
exceptions, varying according to iocat.on,
those within a radius of from 20 to M
minutes walk of the center of business
being most desired. This class of houses
which are for rent aro much more plenti
ful than they were one year ago.
For houses of from three to fivo rooms,
f.m otnn in $000. there is an
unlimited demand, a far greater demand
than ha3 ever been noticeable beiore.
There is a groat scarcity, the supply noth
ing like coming up to the demand, or this
kind of bouses. Reliable gentlemen, who
have been for years in the business of buy
ing, selling and renting houses, said to us
yesterday : "If we had throe hundred
nouses suited to the wants of smaU families,
renting at from tour to six nuuureu uuumo,
wo could rent them every one before to
morrow's sunset." Our city is lamentably
deficient in this class of comfortable, neat,
cheap, residences. Their erection is one of
the highest considerations of our capitalists.
Anynumber of them could be readily rented
with profit to the owner and to the great
convenience of good tenanU and indus
trious citizens. The demand for them is
great and continually increasing. As re
Sards the rents for business houses there

demand for eligibly located business
houses has probably increassd, while in

we will close by saying that, in our judg
ment, those having property to rent, or
tenants desiring to rent for 1871, will not,
perhaps, find better opportunities than are
presented at the present time.
We stated in yesterday's paper that an
extensive flro was in progress in Edgefield
at about two o'clock yesterday morning,
but at that hour no reliable particulars
could be obafned.
We yesterday obtained tha following de
tails: Mr. William T. Sample has recently
been living in what its known as the
"Stratton Place,"' about a mile and a half
from this city, on the Porter Pike,
and but a short distance from
tho Gallatin Pike. In that residence,
on yesterday morning; there were
six persons, namely: Mr. William T. Sam

While common baths tnd general bath ing
facilities are perhaps abundant enough
inthis city, tho idea of establishing a Rus
sian bath does not seem to have entered
tho minds of those Investing capitw in tne
bath business. As an fividence. of the de
mand for such an institution we may state,
that a prominent citizen of NashvJle re
cently remarked that he would be willing
to pay ftto dollara per day towards fhe
support of a gonuino llusaian batb. The
price charged bathers in New York city,
who enter a Russian bath is ono dollar
but probably one dollar and a half or two
dollars would be a fair price here. These
baths aro somswliat similar to Turkish
baths, but are thoughtto bo superior to tha
latter by thoso who have used both. For the
benefit of those who may be curious about
the matter, we will stato the modus oper
andi of a Russian bath, as given to us by
a gentleman ot this city who has frequent
ly enjoyed that bath in New York.
The bather, after his apparel has been
laid asido, is taken into a little room,
where warm water is first spurted on him.
and afterwards cold water. He is then im
mediately taken into a warm room so filled
with steam that he can hardly see two feet
from his face, and placed on a marble slab
or table, where he simply lies and per
spires freely. An attendant at short mter
vals feels his head aud pulse, and when ha
discovers that the bather is perspiring more
freely than he can well bear, cold water is
.nv.iin.1 tn hia hr.-ul. which enables him
the bettor to endnre the operation, borne
persons of strong constitutions can remain
for a long time in the batb, without injury,
while others of week physique can only
remain in for a short time. After the
bather has remained in this room for a snf
ficent length of time, ho Is taken out and
rubbed all over with soap, and every
muscle in his whole body is then rubbed,
and ponndedand kneaded, until hia joints
are limber and his entire body supple and
pliant. Tho bather then jumps into a
pool of coid water, which at first shocks
his nervous system to an almost painfal
degree, but the reaction takes away all nn
pleasant sensations, and he feels like a
new man, or as our informant remarked,
"He feels like; he could jnmp over a meeting-house."
. ,
The bather having resumed hia apparc,
is taken into another apartment, whero ho
ia given a newspaper, and tcld to lio dawn
upon a fajfa, and either read orjgo to sleep.

the Russian baths aro said to be as much
superior to common baths as the latter are
to no bath at all.

Uckolation.
One of tha most forlorn looking "rook
eries" about the city ia the old Theatre
building down on Cherry street. We could
not help noticing i yesterday aa wo troll
ed that way. Its hoary old front, dilapi
dated steps, crumbling gang-way and bat
tered windows, certainly indicated that
the scores of "stars" which had risen and
set within its ancient walls had, as "Sam"'
would express it, "done an gone way."
Shakespeare has evidently ceased to be
"bntchered" or "done brown;" tragedy
enacted its last bloody drama, and comedy
struck out for more congenial quarters.
We know not what is tho appearance oi
the inside, and prefer to keep on only
imagining, ta making a personal reconnoi
sance especially in the right time: for,
though we are not much afraid of ghosts,
we have no hankering to visit good places
for them, and they do say that old theater
ruins aro good spots to find these things
thus. The spirits of play writers will
avenge the butcheries of their productions
by hovering about the fatal spot over the
left.
