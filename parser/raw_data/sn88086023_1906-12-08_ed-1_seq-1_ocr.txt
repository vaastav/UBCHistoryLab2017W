Tho East Must Follow its Own
Teaching.
While the matter of the co-education
of Japnne.se and American chil
dren In the public schools of Oregon
Is not an Issue In this state, yet It Is
one of the remote possibilities of the
future and Governor Chamberlain,
while In Washington, D. C, has voiced
the sentiment of the sttae upon that
subject.
The ejection of the Japanese chil
dren from the public schools of San
Francisco and the strong objections
made by the school bonrd of the Bay
City to the co-education of the races
has brought the question prominently
before the nation and eastern people
are nnxious to sound western senti
ment upon the subject.
President Roosevelt In his recent
message to congress sounded what Is
supposed to be eastern sentiment upon
the subject, and It may he said with
equal truth and weight that the ex
pression of Governor Chnmberlnln In
Washington yesterday clearly por
trayed western sentiment. A Wash
ington dispatch to the Oregon Dally
Journal of last evening says:
"The west Is unalterably opposed to
J()1nt ot-cupancy- of puWIc school
rooms by Japanese or Chinese and
our white children," said Governor
Chamberlain of Oregon today. "We
are also against admission of Chinese
or Japanese coolies. The present
controversy over the Japanese has as
sumed a phase which calls for appli
cation of. mure common sense than
has been manifested in some quar
ters. The Interpretation of treaties
rests solely with the courts, and cer
tainly not with the executive branch
of the government, through the mili
tary, as President Roosevelt threat
ens. "It appears to me that the admin
istration la Inconsistent In attempting
to force association In the public
schools of an Inferior race with white
children, when here In the District of
Columbia there Is a system of separ
ate schools for whites and negroes.
"Let the president and congress
demonstrate here the theory of such
association before trying to force ob
jectionable policies on the people of
the Pacific coast."

HIGH TAXES IN GERMANY.
1
Government In Straits for Army and
Navy Money.
Berlin, Dec. 8. In the relchstag to
day the question of the new taxes was
again under discussion. The fact was
not concealed by the chancellor that
the first three months of the new tax
ation Ioavb, approved last spring by
tho reiehstag, have given much con
ccn to the government, because the
total dues collected are much below
the official estimates.
The tax on railway tickets which
wag expected to bring to the budget
an annual sum of 40.000,000 marks,
hes only produced for the first three
months a total amount of 1,800,000
marks owing to the fact that the ma
jority of third-class travelers In Ger
many now choose the fourth-cluss,
which Is exempt from taxation. It
way expected that the Increase from
the postal tariff would produce 12,
000,000 murks for the government,
but calculations show that the reve
nues for three months, owing to the
Increased tariff, are about three mil
lion marks below that of the corres
ponding period of 1905. Only about
one million marks was raised on the
taxation of automobiles. The gov
ernment expected to obtain 10,000,000
marks a year from taxation on divi
dends but for the past three months
only 100,000 marks were received.
As the expenses of the navy and
nrmy are Increasing at nn enormous
rate, the government Is puzzled to
meet the expenditures.

Complaints Made Concerning Reserve
Allot incuts.
When Ira Lemon nnd his associates
from the Greenhorns were here at
tending the convention of stock nnd
'sheepmen, It was presumed from their
talk that they were satisfied with the
restrictions mnde by the reserve of
ficials upon herds and droves that
might come Hint way, says the Blue
Mountain American of Suniptcr. Evi
dently someone now foeis that the
allotments were too great, otherwise
the following from the Prnlrlc City
Miner could not hnve hno" founda
tion: An nppeal to the dopnrtmcnt of the
Interior by residents of the Greenhorn'
mining districts is probable as a re
sult of the Blue Mountains reserve
range allotment completed Thursday
at Sumpter by department agents.
Miners of tho Greenhorn asked con
siderably more territory than they
got and are reported greatly dissat
isfied. They claimed an extensive al
lotment was necessary to keep their
claims from being overrun by sheep,
but the government representatives
limited them greatly, and fear Impair
ment of their water supply and de
struction of their pasture. In pnst
years a good deal of sheep shooting
has taken place In the Greenhorns.
Superintendent Sheller says that he
had understood thnt the miners had
obtnlned all they asked for and were
satisfied.

CIGAR FACTORY ON FARM.

The spectacle of a full fledged cigar
factory on a farm with the whole
family and the hired man working
tcgethir stemming, stripping and loll
ing tobacco leaves Into the regulation
club and other Shanes Is something
new in the Spokane country, says the

farm contains only about four acres
but Willi diversity farming brought t
a high state of development. It may
become quite a worthy farm despite
its size.
The owner, of this f irm and cigar
factory is John L. Anderson, for some
years p. cigarmuker whose home and
factory were at Montgomery avenue In

Yakima Needs School Rouses.
The school facilities of the city
have reached their limits. There are
now nbout 200 children not attending
school on account of the lack of
room. No place can be provided for
them. The enrollment Is larger than
ever before and It Is growing. The
compulsory law Is not being rigidly
enforced on account of ttie lack of
facility.
The amount of bonds thnt will be
voted on will be decided by those at
tending the mass meeting. The pres
ent bonded Indebtedness of the district
Is $05,000. This amount can be In
creased to $300,000 before the limit
Is reached. As tho money can be ob

NEW OPERA HOUSE
IS
George Peringer Will Build
f rovided He Is Given As
surances of Profit.
AT THE CORNER OF COURT
AND THOMPSON STREETS.
Ho Is Alive to tlio Needs of the Town
and Has Already Consulted a Port
land Architect The Property Al
ready Has Basement Excavated and
a Foundation That Would Carry a
Four or Flvo-Story Building Is
Considering a. Composition, Fire
Proof Structure.
There Is a possibility that Pendle
ton may actually secure a new thea
ter in the near future, not one of, air
as have "been those of the past, but
of brick and mortar and other fire
proof material. George Peringer l
the probable benefactor and he says
that he will erect a theater on his
property at the corner of Court and
Thompson streets If the theatrical
people will come to him with a prop
osition that will Insure him a proper
Income from the same.
During the past few days It has
been rumored upon the streets that
Mr. Peringer is proposing the build
ing of a theater and the theory was
strengthened by the . fact that tha
large billboard which ran diagonally
across the vacant property has been
torn down.
This morning he was asked regard
ing his Intentions and while he ad
mitted he had been figuring upon a
theater, said he had nothing definite
to state regarding the same. He Is
Interested In the matter, regards a
njw playhouse as a pressing need and
would like to build one If he can be
shown that It will pay.
Wants to Build.
According to Mr. Peringer he has
been contemplating a building on his
corner for a long time. The. founda
tion Is now built and It Is sufficient
for a building of four or five stories
should 'such be wanted. While In
Portland recently heonsulted with
an architect regardlndie proposition
and plans for a building have been
partly prepared already.
" "i have three different proposition
In view," he said. "I would like to
erect a first-class building-. I have
thought of making a deal with Mr.
Rohrman whereby we could add an
other story or two to his building and
use the same with a building on my
corner. In that way we would have
plenty of room for a theater, and
could use the first floor for other
purposes."
The proposition of building a thea
ter of composition fire-proof material
similar to that of the Helllg In Port
land. Is also being considered by Mr.
Peringer. There are many who con
sider thnt such a building would fur
nish the most feasible theater for
Pendleton as a structure could be
erected most all the advantages of a
brick building, but at less 'expeiwe.
Also. Mr. Peringer Is being Impor
tuned by Messrs. Carney & Kennedy
to erect another stable on the vacant
property, the same to be used In con
nection with the present City livery.
According to ttoo liverymen they now
lack room and desire the corner for
a vehicle room and for office pur
poses. While he says Managbr Taylor of
the loAil theater has talked with him
upno the subject. Mr. rerlnger says
he has never received anything like
a definite offer from the Northwest
Circuit or from any other concern.
Should those people desire to secure
a new opera house in Pendleton, as
they have declared frequently, it Is
now up to them to show George Per
inger that such a building will pro
duce the needed income. If they do
that he declares he will do the rest.
