JOHNSON BOLTS
CONVENTION
JOHNSON SAYS THAT CONVEN­
TION IS VIOLATION OF THE
PRIMARY LAW
JUDGE LAUDER CHARGES MAR-t
SHALL WITH PACKING THE
CONVENTION
Insurgent Convention Results in a Pow
Wow in Which Opposing Candida
tes Give Vent to Their Wrath
Slate Finally Fixed Up.
Grand Forks, N. D., Nov. 29.—
M. N. Johnson of Petersburg, can
didate for United States senator, »and
liis followers, bolted the insurgent
convention at Grand Forks yesterday
afternoon, which closed in a turmoil
of excitement. The announcement
of Mr. Johnson's retirement was made
by Judge Engerud, who stated that
the attempt of Mr. Marshall and his
friends to force Marshall's nomina
tion was in violation of the new pri
mary election law and a disgrace to
the state.
As the excitement grew to fever
heat, Judge Lauder charged Marshall
with packing the convention. This
precipitated a fierce fight, in which
State Superintendent Stockwell en
deavored to call Lauder down.. Stock
well's interference brought forth a
chorus of disapproval from the John
son men, and the convention lapsed
into a political pow-wow.
Johnson's retirement from the con
vention was accompanied by the with
drawal of his friends, numbering
about sixty-five. These marched out
of the hall, leaving the convention en
tirely in the hands of Marshall and
his friends.
Having eliminated th^ Johnson fac
tion, the Marsha 1 met. proceeded to
make nominations and the following
slate was adopted
For United Static Senator—Thomas
Marshall of Oakes.
For congress—A. O. Young of Val
ley City, and H. T. Helgeson of Mil
ton.
For justice of the supreme court—
Justice Spalding.
For governor—Mr. Twitchell of
Fargo.
For lieutenant governor—H. Hen
ri eke of Grand Forks.
For superintendent of public in
struction—W. L. Stockwell of Graf
ton.
The great fight came late yester
day afternoon when the committee on
rules and order of business made
their report. This committee, of
which Judge Lauder was chairman,
reported that it was the sense of the
committee that no candidates be in
dorsed. This brought forth much
fire from the Marshall men, and the
report was voted down.
Guilty of Misdemeanor
Just as things began to get inter
esting B. G. Skulason of Grand Forks
got up and stated that every member
of the convention in favor of making
a slate could be convicted of mis
demeanor such action being a direct
violation of the new primary election
law, which provides that the nomina
tions shall be made by the people, not
by a few political leaders seeking of
fice^
This elicited a hot fight in which
the Johnson and the Marshall men
paid their respects to each other.
Judge Lauder's accusation that the
Marshall men had packed the conven
tion in the interest of Marshall added
oil to the fire. Superintendent Stock
well did what he could to pacify the
opposing delegates. He told Lauder
that he did not think that the charge
was true. The Johnson men began
to "holler" and the voice of Stock
well was drowned in the tumult.
Some of the delegates accused Mar
shall of furnishing his friends with
transportation to Grand Forks that
the largest number of delegates fav
orable to him possible might be in
attendance.
Nip La Follette Move
An attempt to Indorse La Follette
for president'was made yesterday aft
ernoon but failed. A resolution to
this effect was presented by Trovaa
ten of Fargo, but was not seconded.
No nominations were made from
Ward county. J. M. Devine nominat
ed Marshall for United States sena
tor, rehearsing what he considered
were the good' qualities of the can
didate from Oakes.
There is a good deal o£ speculation
as to what will be the effect of the
convention. The attempt of the can-'
didates for office to force nominations,
and the iron-clad manner fin which
the convention was run is in striking
contrast with' the spirit of the new
primary law, the Intent of which is to
leave the selection of candidates with
the oeople.
WOR3T IS OVER
John D. Says Financial Crisis Has
Passed
New York, Nov. 27.—"The worst is
over," said John D. Rockefeller when
asked his opinion regarding the finan
cial situation. It was at the close of
the service at the Fifth Avenue Bap
tist church which he attended, that
Mr. Rockefeller gave his opinion
to friends. "There was no necessity
for the 'worst* ever to have appear
ed," he continued, "but of course we
are bound to feel the effects of it for
seme time."
"What do you think was the real
cause of the anic?" he was asked.
"Oh, there were a number of caus
es. They all happened to combine
and come to a head at one time. All
of these combined forces created un
easiness and a lack of confidence.
When you remove confidence from the
business world, trouble is bound to
ensue. Confidence will be restored
gradually and we lill resume our nor
mal condition. This is too great a
country to be held down."
"Do you believe President Roose
velt's policy in attacking the trusts
contributed to cause the financial
condition?"
"I believe President Roosevelt to
be actuated by the best of motives,
and have no criticism to make of any
kind. This financial condition was
foreseen long before it was felt. Sev
eral well known men pointed out that
it was bound to come unless measur
es were adopted to stop it."
CROSBY FIRE PUT OUT
Williams County City Has a Narrow
Escape
Crosby, Nov. 27.—Sweepage from
the gasoline lighting plant caused fire
to catch in the draperies in the store
of R. R. Herring. The prompt and
efficient use of a chemical extinguish
er probably saved the entire town,
as the burning of the building in
which the fire started would have
rapidly spread the flames to other
buildings. As it was, there was only
a small amount of damage done.
The scarcity of water and the close
call of the town brought a realization
of the danger of the citizens from the
fire fiend, and steps were at once tak
en to install a complete and adequate
fire fighting apparatus.
NO MORE FINDS
FOR FARM LOANS
STATE SCHOOL FUND IS ABOUT
EXHAUSTED
Applications for Loans Are in Excess
of the Amount of Money Available.
Fargo, Nov. 27.—The board of uni
versity and school lands has had
since the constitutional amendment
providing for the loaning of the funds
on farm lands in the modified form,
applications for these loans which ag
gregate between $200,000 and $300,
000. When these applications are fill
ed, or at least such of them as the
board may grant, the funds of the
board may be exhausted. The fact
that the school land sales in many of
the counties were called off this fall
has had the eifect of reducing the
available cash in the hands of the
board and this condition will remain
until the sales are resumed, which
will not be before next spring, and in
all probability before next fall. It
is true that the payments on school
lands formerly sold, which falls due
this fall and between this time and
next fall, will increase the amount of
available cash in the hands of the
board, but not sufficiently to make
the farm loan feature such as it has
been during the last few months.
GO AFTER PIGGERS
Judge Burke Gets Jury that Suits him
at Mandan.
Bismarck, Nov. 29.—Judge Burke,
sitting 'n the district court at Man
dan, secured a grand jury of 23 to
suit him after several jurors had been
challenged and excused. It is con
fidently expected that a number of
indictments will be returned against
blind piggers and convictions will fol
low.-

TREASURER FOR
WARD COUNTY
DEVINE SAYS THAT THIS WAS
SENTIMENT OF CON
FERENCE.
No Candidate Was Recommended
From Ward County But it Was, the
Sentiment of the Delegates the Po
sition of State Treasurer go to this
Section.
Minot, North Dakota, Nov. 30.—
"It was the general understanding
of the delegates to the insurgent con
ference that the position of state
treasurer go to Ward county," said
J. M. Devine, one of the delegates to
the convention who was back at his
office today.
"No candidate was recommended
from this section, but it was the
sense of the delegates that Ward
county was entitled to an important
office, and the delegates chose that
of state treasurer. The man to be
pushed for this position will be decid
ed upon later, as sentiment crystal
izes."
Mr. Devine says that the report that
sixty-five delegates favorable to M. N.
Johnson walked out of the conven
tion is a mistake. He says that only
four walked out, and they were M.
N. Johnson, B. G. Skulason, Judge
Engerud and Mr. Trovateen of Fargo.
•He says that there was no bolt.
He says that the insurgents were
forced to hold a convention and make
recommendations because of the ac
tion of the stalwarts in making cer
tain recommendations,
"If we hadn't got together and
named a ticket," said Mr. Devine,
"there would be a dozen candidates
for every office bobbing up in every
county. This is what the machine
would like to have us do, but we are
nqt going to do it."
The resolutions passed at the con
ference, setting forth its purpose,
were drafted by Mr. Devine and are
as follows:
Declaration of the Purpose of the
Conference.
It is not the intent of this confer
ence to attempt iri any way by the
recommendations which it shall make
to bind either the consciences, the
votes or the influence of any electors
or class of electors for it is our aim
and desire to place the individual
voter in a position where he will in
the exercise of his franchise be
enabled to cast his ballot uninfluenced
by any person or class of persons
whomsoever. We realize, however,
that it is essential and absolutely
necessary, if the reform within the
republican party are to go forward,
to the elimination of proper influence,
from the politics and government of
this fair state, that some concerted
action be taken by some r|presenta
tive body, selected from thfe republi
can party, to the n J" that those per
sons who favor such reforms may
unite their strength and combine their
influence for the common good—well
knowing that united we are abundant
ly able to accomplish the ends to
which we attain—while our strength,
if divided, would be wasted, our in
fluence destroyed and our cause lost.
For the accomplishment of this pur
pose, therefore, we, a body of repub
lican electors in conference assem
bled for the purpose of reflecting the
sentiment of our respective consti
tuencies in the adoption of a plat
form upon which to stand and the
recommendation of the names of the
persons whom we believe the senti
ment of our state calls to bear our
standardas republicans at the primary
election for state officers to be hold
en in the mouth of June next, do
hereby entreat all republicans and all
persons who believe in the principles
set forth in the following resolutions
and who desire to upliold the right of
the people to govern the state free
from the control of ulterior interests,
to endorse and ratify the recommen
dations here made and give their
earnest and hearty support at the
polls to such candidates for ofTice a?
may be recommended by this confer
ence to the end that the cause of the
people shall triumph, even against
the interests which have heretofore
at times exercised their baneful in
fluence upon the policies of this state.
Resolutions.
1. We heartily comnlend and en
dorse the course pursued by Presi
dent Roosevelt in the regulation of
the great corporations and trusts
and especially commend the firm
stand taken by him in the enforce
ment of all laws with reference there
to without regard to class distinc
tions of any kind.
2. We note with gratification the
spread of the prohibition movement
pnong the various states of the
union. As thei state of North Dakota
has always taken the lead in this
matter, we will continue to upliold
this principle and demand that the
i v
law prohibiting the sale of intoxicat
ing liquor within the state of North
Dakota be enforced in every county
within the state.
3. We recognize that the bone and
sinew of the state Is made up of the
men and women who labor with their
hands and we heartily approve of
their association together in such
federations, societies and labor unions
as they deem advantageous for the
betterment of their condition and we
also especially approve of the feder
ation and association of co-operative
and other societies by our agricultur
ists, for the mutual protection and
advancement of their interests.
4. While reaffirming our faith in
the republican doctrine of protection
to American labor and industry, we
demfmd the immediate revision of
the tariff to the end that such sched
ules as are needlessly high, such as
iron and steel, shall be reduced.
5. We recommend that the corpor
ation laws of the United States and
of our own state be resived and
amended to the end that the respec
tive governments shall have a more
complete and perfect control and su
pervision over the corporate bodies
organized thereunder that proper
safeguards be adopted to prevent the
watering of stocks that their rec
ords and books of account be requir
ed to be subject to public inspection
that federal laws be made to apply to
all corporations doing interstate busi
ness and that they be subject to fed
eral as well as state control and
that this state enact proper publicity
laws to govern foreign corporations
who desire to do business within our
borders.
6. We regard the primary law
adopted at the last session of our leg
islature as a great advance, and we
pledge our support to its proper en
forcement.
7. Wo believe that the financial
panics which from time to time
sweep over this country are largely
caused by lack of confidence upon the
part of the public in the stability and
safety of our banks, both national
and state.
That upon the occurrence of a
slight stringency in the market, many
people fear the loss of their savings
through bank failures and in their
haste to withdraw deposits augment
a panic. That it is desirable and ne
cessary that savings deposited in our
banks should be absolutely safe.
1
That such deposits and all deposits
in the banks should be protected by
the inauguration of a system of taxa
tion upon all banks as a guarantee
fund, shall be provided to be adminis
tered by the government and to be
held as security for the payment of all
deposits.
We recommend the passage of a
law providing for such insurance of
deposits by both tiie nation and the
state, and we request of our senators,
members of congress and the legisla
ture their hearty support of such a
measure in their respective depart
ments of the government.
8. Under existing conditions the
price of agricultural products is not
fixed by the wholesome law of supply
and demand, but is determined by
speculators upon the boards of trade.
We are therefore in favor of the en
actment of stringent laws making it
unlawful to gamble in options and fu
tures and all other gambling transac
tions in the products of the soil for
we believe that the enactment of such
a law will have a wholesome and ben
eficial influence upon the market price
of agricultural products.
9. We believe in ascertaining the
actual value of the properties of pub
lic service corporations, such valu
ation to be used as a basis for assess
ment and taxation and for rate regu
lations.
10. We are in favor of federal con
trol of the inspection and grading and
weighing of grain.
11. We favor the enlargement of
the scope of the strengthening and
the strict enforcement of the pure
food law.
12. We favor any legislation that
will Improve our national waterways
and approve of any means, whether
by irrigation or drainage, that will
increase the area of arable lands in
this ountry.
13. We favor a continuation of the
policy of President Roosevelt with re
gard to the preservation, for the peo
ple, of our national resources, such as
forests, coal fields, water courses and
public domain.
14. Without expressing any opin
ion as to the merits of the pending
resolution passed at the last legisla
ture, we hereby express our approval
the principle of the initiative and
referendum.
DEMAND FOR POULTRY
Poultry Jroducts in United States
Equal Wheat Crop in Value
ducts of the United States annually
equal in value *he wheat crop. As
yet North Dakota has paid but slight
attention to this resource, which
would add millions to the wealth of
the state generally developed. In
fact large quantities of eggs are im
ported into the state. The number
of inquiries received at the Agricul
tural College shows that the care and
management of poultry are not com
monly understood in our state. To
give information and practical sug
gestions to persons wishing to take
up poultry raising, the Agricultural
College Experiment Station has for
two years been conducting experi
ments on poultry raising under North
Dakota conditions. The results of
these experiments are set forth 'n a
b-lletin just ssued for free distribu
tion. The work was done by Prof.
J. H. Shepperd and Mr. O. W. Dynes.
The bulletin covers such points as
would be of most value to beginners
in practical poultry culture. Among
the topics presented are:
Description of breeds Egg and
general purpose breeds caring for
the sitting hen natural and artificial
methods of atching operating the
incubator how much and what to
feed care of young chicks breeding
stock cold vs. farm housing pre
serving eggs in-breeding grade
breeding trials method of destroying
lice and mites ventilation location
and dimensions of the poultry house.
The treatment of the general subject
is simple and direct, and this bulle
tin should mark an epoch in the
history of poultry raising in North
Dakota.

selves the expense of making experi
ments in poultry raising by writing

TICKET FOR CORPSE
Train Auditor on Great Northern Pas
senger No. 6 Is Baffled.
Grand Forks, Nov. 9.9.—A rather
remarkable incident happened on
train No. 6, bound for St. Paul, Tues
day night. The porter was given an
envelope from the conductor at Grand
Forks containing three tickets to St.
Paul. When the train auditor came
through between Crookston and
Grand Forks he was given the en
velope and checked up his passen
gers.
He found two easily enough as they
were occupying the same berth. He
hunted the train from one end to the
other trying to discover where the
third party was. Everyone on the
train had ticket and the train audi
tor was in a quandry.
Finally the two whom he did locate
were awakened and asked where the
third member of the party" was, and
he was informed that the third ticket
was for a corpse up in the baggage
car and was en route to Chicago.
Very much discomfitted the auditor
beat a hasty retreat.
MILITARY BALL SUCCESS
Program Is Carried Out According to
Plans and Everyone Is Pleased over
the Entertainment.
Minot, North Dakota, Nov. 30.—
The Military ball at the opera
house last evening proved to be a
grand success, both in attendance and
a good time.
The opera house was artistically
decorated with red, white and blue
bunting and from the stage which
was characteristic of a soldiers camp
issued the strains of the music from
the orchestra. Following the concert
dancing began with the grand march
led by Adjutant General Poole and
Mrs. J. J. Coyle. Following them were
Capt. Blakey and Maj. Persons with
their ladies and then the different of
ficers followed by the privates. Danc
ing continued until a late hour, whei.
the music of "Home Sweet Home"
brought the evening's enjoyment to a
close.
This was the second military ball
given and It is hoped they will con
tinue to be annual event. Many
people from out of the city were in
attendance and everyone reports a
most excellent time.

Chunk of Coal.
Kenmare, North Dakota, Nov. 29.—

old, was killed instantly yesterday af
ternoon by a bed of coal which fell
upon him as he was working in the
Electric mine at Kenmare.
Battcer is survived by a widow and
a child who live in Minot. He was
about thirty years- old and had been
working at the mine for some time.
Complete details of the accident
have not been received. It Is said

TRY TO SOLVE
MONEY TROUBLE
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT WILL
MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS
Currency Legislation Will Form Large
Part of the President's Mecsage.
New York, Nov. 30.—The coming
session of the sixtieth congress, which
will convene on Monday, and the pres
entation of President Roosevelt's
message will, as a matter of course,
largely engross public attention next
week. Words, not actions, will likely
forin the keynote of the session, as is
always the case when congress meets
just prior to a presidential campaign.
Oratory will doubtless flow unconfin
ed, but any inclination to enthusias
tic energy will be frowned upon.
There is only one obstacle to this tra
ditional do-nothing policy, and that is
the personality of Theodore Roose
velt. Whether the lawmakers will de
fy the big stick and follow precedents
remains to be determined.
It is expected that the president's
message will reiterate those measures
which have come to lie known as the
"Roosevelt policies." Perhaps the
most important of ail the recommen
dations will be that relating to the
over-capitalization of railroads and
the control of great corporations do
ing an interstate business. It is likely
that the president will urge legisla
tion to provide for emergency cur
rency based on bank assets and so
taxed that its retirement as soon as
its immediate usefulness Is gone will
be assured. These suggestions for
currency reform are more eagerly
awaited than usual, in view of the
present financial situation. The mes
sage is also expected to recommend
federal licenses for corporations do
ing interstate business, the amend
ment of the Sherman anti-trust law
in regard to corporations acting in re
straint of trade, the graduated inheri
tance tax, to which the president has
already committed himself, and the
revision of the Philippine tariff, which
was left over from last session. Cor
poration grabbing of public lands will
be condemned. The sending of the
fleet to the Pacific will be discussed
in its relation to foreign affairs. Uni
form marriage and divorce laws will
probably be touched upon, as will
probably will be the subject of child
labor and the methods of prevention.
An educational test for immigrants
will be the subject of a recommenda
tion. The labor question will le con
sidered an suggestions made for the
arbitration of labor disputes and an
employers' liability law. The Panama
canal project will receive consider
able attention, and the development
of in'and waterways will be the sub
ject of a lengthy chapter in the presi
dential message.
The members of congress will this
year escape the wire-pulling and im
portunities for jobs that usually at
tends the organization of a new con
gress. Ail of the old officers and chief
employes of the House will gio into
office again. Joseph G. Cannon of Il
linois will resume the speakership
without opposition, and there will be
no contest for any other place of hon
or or profit in the House. Presiden
tial .politics as a scientific game will
doubtless be the feature of the ses
sion.
WOMAN INSANE
Lady Who Attempted to Hang Herself
at Des Lacs Is Taken Care of
•Minot, North Dakota, Nov. 30.—
Mrs. Mollienkoff of Des Lacs, who
tried to kill herself last Friday, was
sent to the insane asylum at James
town today.
Mrs. Mollienkoff was releases three
weeks ago in the belief that her men
tal condition had greatly Improved,

ed special care.
Last Friday she was fount at her
home, with her throat cut, indicating
that she had tried to take her life.
She has several children, all »f whom
are adults.
Unexplained
We find poor shrunken bodies some
times hold
The nobler nature and the truer
heart,
And can but marvel when we see un
fold
Such wonders 'neath the poor ex
ternal part.
It is as though some barren waste
we trod
And came upon a rose of beauty
rare
We may not understand, yet feel that
God
For some good reason set it grow
ing there.

tober Delineator.
