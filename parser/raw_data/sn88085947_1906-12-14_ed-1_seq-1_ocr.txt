EVIDENCE ALL IN EXCEPT
r TESTIMONY OF EXPERTS
Just before tbe close of the
morning session of the Sloane
trial today Attorney Robertson an
nounced that all his evidence was
in except, expert testimony on his
client's insanity. He asked that
the court allow the jury to visit,
the home of James F. Sloane In
demonstration that the killing was
certainly that of an insane per
son. He was overruled.
The prosecution this morning
named Dr. George K. McDowell as
Its expert and the defense yester
day named Dr. Semple, the two
physicians to constitute a commis
sion to examine into the sanity or
Insanity of Sidney Sloane.
The testimony of thees physi
cians will close the case so far as
evidence is concerned, and it is
expected that at least two days
will be consumed in argument.
At the noon hour the doctors
went to Sidney Sloane's cell and
conducted the examination of the
accused boy. No others were al
lowed in the cell at the time.
Bertha Hiibner, a nurse In the
Sloane household from the time
Sidney was three years old until
he was six, was the first witness
called in sur-rebuttal by the de
fense, for the purpose of impeach
ing the testimony of Witness Cle
ments, who testified to Sidney's
childish passions while at his
home.
The prosecution objected to this
witness offering any testimony at
all because She was not called be
fore. Robertson said he could im
peach every line of Clements' tes
timony and prove it as unqualified
ly false.
UNION JURISDICTION
FIGHT ON N. P. WORK
An effort was made yesterday
to compel membera of the cement
workers' union to quit work on
the extension being built to tbe
Northern Pacific freight sheds.
The building laborers' union, which
1b affiliated with the structural al
liance, claimed jurisdiction over
the work and demanded that, the
other trades support them in com
pelling the cement workers to quit
work. Blialneaa Agent Miller, of
the structural alliance, supported
the building laborers in their con
tention and called upon the car
penters and the engineer employed
"bm mv loh to strike. The en
gineer quit, but tho carpenters re
mained at work. After the en
gineer was Informed that the ce
ment workers were an A. F. of L.
union and Would have tot be sup
ported by members of that organi
zation he returned to work. It is
said that the engineering depart
ment of the railway company,
upon learning that there was some
trouble over the work, informed
the contractors that the railway
company would bring In their own
men to complete the work in case
It was tied up.

The witness was not allowed to
testify to other than Sidney's hab

Judge M. J. Gordon, ex-supreme
court justice, and Assistant State's
Attorney General McDonald were
then called to impeach George
Lawrence Sinclair's statement that
Oct. 8 Robertson interviewed him
in Mullen, Idaho. They testified
that Robertson on that day ac
companied Gordon to Seattle.
Mrs. Syphers, landlady of the
Sloane household at the time of
the tragedy, was then called. She
was not allowed to testify on the
showing made by Attorney Robert
son as to what, he intended to
prove by her when the prosecution
objected.
Mike O'Shea, for whom Hack

frequent endeavors to ar„<rue with
the prosecution, the court inter

Robertson replied In great heat:
"Well, so do 1!"
The court leaned forward and
said loudly: "Mr. Robertson, If
there is another outburst of that
kind something will bo done to
you!"
"I've tried to proceed very ex
peditiously. If there's any delay
It's by the prosecution," responded

the building laborers and cement
workers may lead to further
trouble.
The cement workers are affil
iated with the American Federa
tion of Labor, while the local union
ol' building laborers is afilliated
with the International building la
bobrers' union, which is not a
member of the federation. The lo
cal union of the building laborers
is afilliated with the structural al
liance in this city, while the ce
ment workers send delegates to
the central la'hor union.
It is rumored that the building
laborers' union has applied to the
International bed carriers' union
for a charter. TheaVhod carriers
union is affiliated with the Ameri

should prove to he true the entire
question would bo settled by the

SPOKANE MAN ABLE TO READ SECRETS
OF WALL ST. POWERS BY TELEPATHY
If a man told you he could sit
here in Spokane and tell by pro
cess of telepathy just what Wall
st. manipulators in New York in
tended to do with certain railroad
stocks you would be apt to doubt
the statement, wouldn't you?
But what would you think if he
proved his possession of such pow
er by predicting a certain fluctua
tion for certain stocks, his predic
tions being verified in every par
ticular the next day or two?
How would you figure it out?
And what would J. Pierpont Mor
gan and the Rockefeller crowd
think if they knew that a Spokane
man is able to tap their wires and
announce the purposes of their
most secret stock raids days 'be
fore the coup is sprung?
Tho proposition sounds prepos
terous, yet Judge William McDon
ald, formerly on the superior
bench at Colfax, is handing out
such forecasts daily at the rail
road stock exchange in this city,
and he has yet to fall down on a
single prediction, with one excep
tion. That exception resulted from
unlocked for prosecution of the B.
& 0. road by the government. The
judge has shared his hunches with
other" broken, and while they
doubted him at first they have
watched tho figures he predicted
appear on the. board until they
have come to the conclusion that
his mental wire Is a sure tip.
Lately Judge McDonald has re
ceived a proposition from Kansas
City brokers who have heard of
his power and are anxious to put
their money down on his tips. They
want to syndicate him and clean
out the railroad stock market. It
is a rule of the exchange that any'
man who can guess within $3 of
the rise and fall of the market has
his fortune made. The judge hits
it to a fraction.
Here are a few samples of what
Judge McDonald has done in the
way of lining up the stock mar
ket by means of the "messages"
he receives in such mysterious
fashion:
Yesterday, just before St. Paul
Ai Milwaukee stock went to !I2 3-4,
be announced at the exchange that
this stock would go to 94 and
probably 98. This morning St.
JEREMIAH F. DINAN
her will be increased to nearly 50
in (he near future, when the con
solidation is completed. At the
present time the mill is behind
with orders and is working to its
full capacity.
NEW COMPANY
NAMES OFFICERS
The first annual meeting of the
s'rwkholders of the Coeur d'Aiene
National Mining Co., recently or
ganized in this city, was held last
evening and the following officers
elected: President, C. W. Renard;
Vice president, E. F. White; secre
tary. J. W. Mcßride; treasurer,
raul was quoted at 98%.
For the past month Judge Mc-
Donald has been announcing his
"messages" at the exchange. Sev
eral weeks ago, when Missouri Pa
cific dropped to 91%, St. Paul to
IOTV4, Union Pacific to 179%, and
everybody looked for further de
clines, the judge astounded the ex
change by rising and announcing
that he had just received a tele
pathic message from Wall st. that
Missouri Pacific would advance to
Oil by the next Saturday; Union Pa
cific to above 188, and St. Paul to
1,8 7-8.
' The tracers declared such an ad
vance In so short a time impos
sible under prevailing conditions,
but the prediction was verified ex
actly at the appointed time.
A still more startling demonstra
tion of the judge's strange power
was given when St. Paul stock de
clined again to 177%. He then an
nounced that Wall st. manipulators
had decided to take the stock
over ISO, and presently It was up
to 188 on schedule time.
It then began to decline and the
Judge stated that he had been in
formed by hiß mysterious agency
that It would not go below 180.
when it would advance again.
Jndge McDonald fixed 184 as tho
high mark this time, and on reach
ing that point the stock fell again
to a fraction above 180.
Then the Judge tried the confl
dance that the brokers were be
ginning to feel in his strange
hunches by announcing that St.
Paul would advance to 188 then de
cline and finally shoot up to 102 3-4.
This prediction was made Monday.
Ojl Tuesday all railroad stock ex
cept St. Paul began to drop, some
of them declining $20 per share.!
St. Paul alone soared aloft, and on J
Thursday touched IMB-4, Just as
the judge said it would. He made
equally true predictions concerning ,
Reading stock.
One of tho queerest features of
Ml queer trick of the mind is that:
Jlldgo McDonald can't help tipping
off the market even when he
tries to. Whenever there is any
thing doing iv Wall st. the Judge
Bays the figures come up before
his mental vision as if they we;e

get away from them. At first he
thought study of stocks was turn
ing his brain and made desperate
efforts to shut out the figures, but
they remained right there. All the
judge knows about It Is that a
message, as he calls it, comes and
is tabulated and reproduced some
where in his brain.
When asked if tho messages
threw him into a trance the judge
emphatically repudiated the idea.
"It's just like reading a sign over
the door," he said. He has been
so invariably right In the past that
ho has utmost confidence now in
his messages and his associates
are becoming rapidly converted to
the belief that the Judge is a sure
shot on anything Wall st. is hatch
ing up.
Telepathy is something Judge
McDonald has made a study of for
years and he is almost convinced
that he has become perfected in
the strange art. for the mastery of
which men have been struggling
for ages.
j Sixteen years ago he received a
vision that his 'brother, J. S. Mc-
Donald, then foreman of a mine
in Texas, had been horribly mu
tilated and killed in an accidental
discharge of dynamite. Another
brother. Rev. C. T. McDonald, now
of Qrangevllle, Idaho, was then in
Missouri. He receive 1 the same
impression and Immediately left
for Texas, knowing his brother's
resilience. He found the brother
injured exactly as depicted to the
judge In Colfax and himself, al
though alive. J. S. McDonald re
covered and is now a minister and
attorney at 110, Idaho. He adds a
perplexing feature to the occur
rence by declaring that he died
from the injury and his soul passed
out of the window. He saw his
body left behind and in some fash
ion return to it, thus confirming
the telepathic suggestion that he
had died.
No one who has had any con
veraation or dealing! with Judge
M. Donald will for a moment be
lieve he Is insane or insincere in
his claim to the strange power
credited to him. He mentions it
modestly, 'but never declines to

one in order that its veracity may
be tested by succeeding events.
