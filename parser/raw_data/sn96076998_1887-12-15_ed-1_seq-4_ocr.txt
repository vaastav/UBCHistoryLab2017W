Optlou for the Purchase of Mrs. Storey's
Paper. ,
A Chicago telegram of Saturday last says:
The Inter Ocean of this morning prints the
fo!low"ni spooial to'egram from Washington:
Stephen D. Elklns has just returned from ths
West where he has been on other busineisv
That business, it Is ascertained, had immediate
relation to the political fortunes of air. lilaine
in mat section, one of the objects of which is to
consider the propriety of securing a Republican
Protectionist morning newspaper In Chicago,
which shall advooate Mr. Blaine's nomination
for the Presidency. Possibly this move
ment would not have been brought
to light but tor the editorials
which Lave recently appeared in the Chi
cago Tribune in the first Instance approving
the tariff message of President Cleveland, sec
, otid in announcing that that newspaper cannot
support Mr. Ulalue nor any one else for the
Presidency upon the platform which Mr.
Ulaiue has laid down in the interview
jut cabled from Paris. Some of tho
members of tho National Committee were
frlvutely advised that no matter what
bo t ribune might do, there would be soon a
Republican protectionist organ in Chicago
which would support Mr. Blaine, both as a man
and a protectionist, and one of Mr. Blaine's
chief lieutenants said to-day, after reading
tho telegraph editorial in wbioh the an
nouncement was xnade that the Tribuns
would not support Mr. Blaine: "It does
not matter much anyway whom the Tribune
will support. Mr. Blaine will be sup
ported for the nomination in Chicago by a Ke
publioan protectionist newspaper." These
suggestions, dropped to some extent nnder the
breath, mean this : J. 8. CI ark son, of Iowa, of
the Des Moines Iicoister, and a syndicate of
which it is said Mr. Steven B. Elklns. Mr.
Runnels, of Iowa, and several capitalists are
heads, have secured an option for the purchase
of the Chicago Times newspaper, that option
, being aa assignment, if it may be.so termed, of
the option reoently reported to have been given
to other parties. '
BUSINESS PKOSPECTS.
Review of the Condition of Trade In Spec
ulative and Commercial Lines.
The business failures daring the wock num
bered for the United Statos 226 and for Can
aJa 23. a total of 254, compared with 224 the
previous week and 274 the corresponding
weok last year. K (J. Dun 4 Co., in thoir
woekly review of trade, say:
Legitimate trade continues fairly active for
the season, though embarrassed in some
branches by the fluctuations in speculative
markets. Speculation in products, after a few
days of wild advance, has taken a turn down
ward, as the natural result of enormous sales to
realize. With rapidly expanding currency.money
is generally easier than a week ago, though
rates are still high at many point, and com
plaints of slow collections do not diminish.
Agitation of the tariff question already begins
to cause revision of calculations for tho future
in some departments. The sharp decliae in
real estate speculations and prices at some
Southern and Western points tends to chock
developments there, and subjects investors to
sume financial strain. Larue sales of Bessemer
iron at f 18.50 are reported, and a salo of stoel
rails netting 131 at mill has been made Buy

FRANCE'S NEW CABINET.
It May Try to Repress the ?arls Municipal
council.
It is definitely known that M. Fallieros will
. attempt to form a cabinet, says a Paris dis
patch of Saturday. The report is also con
firmed that his ministry will include several
members of the late Government, including
M. ltouvier, M. Flourons. and Oenoral For

discuss the attitude to be taken by tho Party
towird M. Falhero's cabinet. It is said that
the first act of the new ministry will be the
adoption of repressive measures against the
Paris Municipal Council. With this object in
view a bill wUl be introduced to modify the

A dispatch from Wabisb, lnd., says of his
laat hours: v
Snyder had been growing weaker for sever at
months past, and, though before genial In dis-
fns It Ion, he had become morose and talked but
ittle. Ills pale and haggard counteuance be
trayed the agony he Buttered, but repeated
efforts to Induce quietude were futile, and he
literally walked himself to death. He re
mained conscious to the last, but was
unable to control bis lower limbs. Snyder
during the last summer amassed over llo.OOO
from dime museum engagements. For nearly
throe years previous to his death be was im
plied by some mysterious force fro walk con
stantly, and he took his meals while continuing
ths ceaseless tramp, lie slept but UUJe, gen
srally in a chair, but the minute he woke be
itartd walking. The ease has puttied the
hundreds of physicians that have visited blm,
and is without a parallel la the history of mod
leal solenoe.
THE SOUTHERN STATES.
Tux neighborhood of Rives, a small town
in Tennessee, has been the scene of a triple
lynohlng, says a Memphis telegram. Adam
Charles, Andy Miller, and William Smith were
the victim. The crime was an assault on a
10-year-old child, the daughter of M. Meyers,
while on her way to school alone. The child
reached home more dead than alive. In lees
than an hour men were on the trail of the
miscreants. Miller was soon captured, and
revealed the hiJing-place of his companions,
who were found in the woods near by. No
accusations were made by the pursuing party,
who proceeded in ominous sileuoe to a wood
near by, where the three were hanged. Tho
negroes in the community were thoroughly
in sympathy with the actions of the avenging
party, and condomned the assault in unmeas
ured terms.
THE NATIONAL CAPITAL
Fkom the annual report of Secretary of War
Endioott, which is a very lengthy document,
we gloan the following points:
The expenditures of the department for tho
last fiscal year amounted to $U,3Ho,15. while
the estimates tor tho next fiscal year will aggre
gate fo3,H3H,71. An increase is demanded on
acoountof public works, including river and
harbor Improvements, and for the military
establishment and the army and military
academy. The Secretary strongly epprovos of
the recommendation contained in Ueneral
bheridan's report touching the exten
sion of all possible all by the General
Government to the national guard of the
different btates, and suggesting a system of na
tional encampment for btate militia at tne en
tire expense of the National Government. At
tention is called to the fact that the i'acino
coast is destitute of fortifications, guns and
armament of every description, while ban Fran
cisco Is without a single gun which can be fired
with safety with the present charges of pjwder
and modern projectiles. Favorable indorse
ment is also given to the Lieutenant
General's recommendation that the present
strength of the navy be Increased by
O.ooo mon ; and particular attention is called to
the importance of an increase of the artillery.
In concluding bis report the Secretary says i
"The result of the examinations for promotion
under the civil-service regulations wnioh were
applied to the war department in May were
satisfactory. The total number of clerks ex
amined was 1.014, of whom 1M3, or 93 per cent,
passed, and of this number 3i3, or S3 per cent.,
obtained an average above 0J er cent. ; fifty
one, or 5 per cent., failed to pass, their average
being less than 79 per cent.
The annual report of Attorney General Gar
land gives a full account of the business of
the Department of Justice during the last
fiscal year, together with statistics of crime
against tho Uoited States:
The number of ordinary suits now pending in
the Court of Claims is J, 110, involving the
sum of 113,250,000. The number of cases filed
under the Bowman act is 1,119, involving about
5o,0O0,0OO. The petitions filed in French spoli
ation cases uurubtr 5,800, representing 2,483
vessels and about fHO.000,000. The amount
reported in favor of claimants in eighty
one of these cases passed upon is about
Hii.000. varving from 4A to $13,31. Dur
ing the laHt fiscal year, 1,777 civil suits were
terminated. In V'l of these judgments were for
the United Mates, in lOJ for the defendents, V6
were appealed from the District to the Circuit
Court, and 14 from the Circuit t'ourt to tho Su
preme Court. There were rending July 1, 4,154
civil suits, in which the United States was a
party. During the year there were 12,007
criminal prosecutions, mostly for viola
tions of customs and internal revenue
laws. The Attoney General calls atten
tion to the suggestions and recom
mendations made by him in bis last annual
report in regard to matters calling for remedial
legislation, and again urges the necessity of
immediate action thereon. These subjects are
as follows : Fees of Marshals in the Territories,
Eay of Deputy Marshals, revision of the fee
ill, substitution of fiscal for calender year,
protection to civil officers and witnesses, fees of
witnesses and jurors, criminal procedure, per
jury, and laws and juries in the District of Co
lumbia. Fbom Secretary Whitney's annual report we
glean that
Appropriations for the Navy Department for
the last fiscal year amounted to ID, 189,000, and
the balance available at the end of that period
was sua 1,800, which had been reduced by Deo. 1
to tl04,5O0. The appropriations for the current
fiscal year amount to iio,12 oOJ, and the esti
mates for the year ending June 30, 1899, to 123,
4'27,UOO. All the unarinored vessels au
thorized by Congrees are completed win
contract cost of their hulls and "machinery
are: The dispatch vessel Dolphin, 1315,

the protected cruiser Atlanta, $tfl7,ouu; the pro
tected cruiser Chicago, swj.OOO ; the protected
cruiser Charleston, (1,017,000; the protected

4'J0,000; gunboat No. 4 (cruiser), f liW.COJ; dyna
mite cruiser (including dvnamlte guns, etc.),
S.t.'io.OOO; nrst-class torpedo 'boat, H2,7aO. Of the
two armored vessels authorized by Congress
one is now being built by William John in En
gland. The completion of the double-turreted
monitors will be delayed until the Bethlehem
Plant can furnish the armor. Cf coast and
harbor defense, for which Congress appropri
ated S2,0u0,0JO, the Secretary says little has
been done. Tho Secretary does not believe in
repairing the aingle-turreted monitors and
using them for coast defense. "An examina
tion of their characteristics," he says,
"shows that outside of the ships in our
oaa navy no antagonist could probably
be found against which they could
stand for a moment They were good vessels
for their time, but are entirely obsolete," and
he adds: "It would be Utile less than murder
to send men in these at the present time to en
counter any recently built ironclad. 1 appreci
ate (fully that it is only as a temporary expedi
ent that it Is suggested, and wltn the thought
that in the absence of anything else, these
might be better than nothing, 'ihis has been
the theory upon which over $00,000,000, and
probably f 7j,OJO,000, has been spent since
tho close of the war. It is time to stop
it and be content only with the best. If ev
ery dollar is ma le to couut upon something
of real value, waste will stop, and not before.
Contra it y to usual custom, the annual re
port of tho Secretary of the Treasury was
not sent to Congress this year until tho day
aft?r (lie President's message had been read.
It is a Tory lengthy paper, and we have spaca
for only a brief synopsis. The report shows
that tho receipts of the Government for the
last fiscal year were to71,40:,277, and tho ex
penditures t.'Jl5,&35t4J. There was an in
crease in the receipts of :$4,9i3,5Ta over
those of the preceding year, and the expendi
tures were increased by t A 4 P.), 041. The
revenues for the present year are estimated
at tmJ,0CO,0JO, and the expenditures at 1310,
817,7i5. The Secretary advises a reduction of
the customs duties on the lines suggestel in
the President's message. Ihe Socretarygiyai
three ways in which the receipt) and expendi
tures of tho Government may bo mad) about
equal:
1. The purchase of the Interest-bearing debt
of the Government, ii. Larger expenditures by
Government for otLer purposes than the pur
chase of bonds, so that they shall each year
equal the taxation of that year. V. Reduction
of the revenue from taxation to the amount
actually required to meet necessary expenses.
I cannot believe that Congress will adopt tho
second expedient, viz.: The enlargement of
Government expenses simply to expend money
raised by taxation when the public weal does
not otherwise call for the expenditure.
An to tho tli nl plan, Mr. Fairchild say:
Reduction of the revenue from taxation is
the only fit remedy for the evils which threaten
the country. This may be accomplished in va
rious ways. One is to reduce or abolish internal
revenue taxation. In favor of this is the fact
that in a small part of the Southern States the
internal tax on liquors and tobacco is thought to
be oppressive and Is odions to the people of
those regions, and the further fact that by the
reduction the expenses of its collection might
be somewhat reduced. The chief cause for the
f rejudlce against this tax seems to be that as
here was no such tax before the war for the
Union it is looked upon as a reminder of the
measures adopted to raise money to carry on
the war, and which ontrbt not to be continued
in time cf peace. Taxation tnere must be.
The choice is between kinds of taxation ; each
man candeclae for biinsolt, if he will examine
the subject free from prejudice, which is the
least buraensome for him, for his family, and
for bis neighbors, and which is in tne end
better for his whole country. That in
ternal taxation- of spirits and tobacco
began during the war is not a re a on why
it soould be done away with now, if it be in it
self wise. So the fact that the rates of customs
taxation were raised during the same war far
higher than ever before in our history, and have
been continued until now, ought not to deter
mine the manner of their treatment; this
should rather depend upon what is Just and ex
pedient at the present time. Neither passion.
frejudice, nor sentimentality should have place
n the consideration of questions of taxation.
As to the expense of collecting the Internal
revenue, 1 suggest that an amalgamation of tue
customs and internal revenue systems Is entirely
feasible, and that thereby a large number of
offices inluht be abolished, and that the ex
pense of the whole system might be made not
to exceed that of au efficient enforcement of
the customs laws. But it la not well
either Jo abedjab or reduce tsjornsl-revenua
taxation ; It is a tax upon whisky, beer, and
tobaeoo, things which are in very small meas
ure necessary to the health or happiness of
mankind. If they are necessary to any
Unfortunate man, they are far less neces
sary even to blm than are a thou
sand other articles which the Government
taxes. This tax is the least burdensome, the
least unjust of all the taxes which the Govern
ment lays or cau lay upon the ieople ; It should
not be abolished, nor should it be reduced if,
with due regard to the existing conditions of
labor and capital, suffloient reduction can be
made in the taxation of necessary articles
which are In the dally use of all the people.
Tho report shows that the circulation of the
standard silver dollar is growing in popular
ity, having increasod f 10,4'i4,WJ5 during the
past year.
A Washington special to the Chicago
Inter Ocean says:
The negotiations of the FisheryCommlssion
are approaching an end, and there i good
authority for the statement that all attempts
to secure agroemeut upon a treaty have failed.
It appears that Mr. Chamberlain and Mr.
Bajtfird could have come to an under
standing, but Bir Charles Tupper is ob
durate and Is not willing to accept
the terms to which alone the American
Commissioners and Secretary Bayard are will
ing to agree, bir Charles Tupper, In fact, Is
classed by his associates aa an irreooncilable,
and they acknowledge to those in official rela
tions with them that it may be considered that
the negotiations, so far as the treaty goes, are
practloally at an end.
Those who are best Informed upon the sub
ject are now of the opinion that so far as our
administration goes the subject will end by a
recommendation by the l'resident to Con
gress that a joint resolution shall be passed au
thorizing the Executive to refer all questions as
to the Interpretation of the treaty of 1818 to ar
bitration. UnE Unitod States Supreme Court has ren
dered a doclsioi sustaining the State in tho
Kansas prohibition case The effect of this
opinion is to declare valid the prohibition
laws of the Stato of Kansas, and is of course
a decided victory for the Prohibitiouisti.
Tho decision is very import in t, and likely to
be far-reaching in ltd consequouoea The
judgment of the court wai pronounced in
long and elaborate opinion by Mr. Justico
Harlan:
The Justice sail it bad been held repeatedly
that the right of a Hate to regulate the sale of
liquor did not invade the constitutional rights
of the citizen. It was contended, however, ho
said, that no Btate Legislature had a right to
rohibit any person from manufacturing
iquor for bis own use or tor export, for the roa
son that it was an invasion of the personal
liberty Inherent In citizens. It must be ob
served, however, he said, that the right to man
ufacture drink for one's own use was sub
ject to the restriction that it should not injuri
ously affect the public. The right to determine
what was injurious had to exist somewhere,
and the right of determining what measures
were necessary for tho preservation of the pu blio
morals, health and safety had heretofore been
vested in the Btates Dy the constitutional right
fiven them nnder the police power to regulate
heir own internal concerns. While this police
power could not be abused and must only be
exercised for objects of real merit, this court
would certainly not say that the liquor traftio
was -not one which the Btate could lawfully
prohibit, because It was well known that the
abuse of intoxicants was productive of pauper
ism and crime. The next ground of contention,
the Justice said, was, that as the breweries had
been erected prior to the passage of the prohibi
tion law, and, as they were of little use except for
breweries, their property was taken without
due process of law in violation of the Consti
tution. But all property under our form of
government, he held, was subject to the
obligation that It should not be used so
as to injuriously affect the rights of tk com
munity, end thereby become a nuisance. The
Btate of Kansas had a right to prohibit the
liquor tranio. It did not thereby take away the
the property of brewor. It simply abated a
nuisance. The property was not taken away
from its owners; they were only prohibited
from using it for a specific purpose, which the
Legislature declared to be injurious to the
community.
Justice Field concurred in the opinion so
far as it related to the two cases in which the
State of Kansas was defendant
He agreed, he aaid, to so much of the opinion
as sustains the validity of the act of Kansas
prohibiting the sale of intoxicants which are
manufactured in the btate after the passage of
the act. He was not prepared, however, to say
that the prohibition of the manutacture of such
liquors, if intended for exportation, can be sus
tained, nor that the Btate can forbid the aale
under proper regulationa for the protection of
the health and morals of the people
of any article which Congress may
authorize to be imported. He was
not ready to admit that New York or any
other coast State can thus defeat an act of Con
gress. Neither could he concur in the validity
of .the thirteenth section of the prohibition act
of Kansas, because he believed it authorized
the destruction of property without due process
of law. He could not see upon wbat principle
ord'Jro'ftesTftcMoVo'r
may be valuable for medical or meohanical pur
poses ; nor could ho see why the protection of
the morals of tho btate required the destruc
tion of bottles and other utensils after the
liquor bad been oinj tied from them.
THE POLITICAL FIELD.
Chicago is to havo tho next Republican
Convention, tho National Committee having
so decided at iti mooting in Washington to
dctcrni'ne the question. Three ballots were
necessary. The first vote was viva voce, and
Chicago lod, with Omaha a very closo sec ind.
The first formal billot placed Chicago well to
the front, tho principal strength of the oppo
sition going to Cincinnati and Minneapolis.
The final vote stool: Chicago , Cincinnati

ington special:
The rival smaller Western cities were very
persistent, very demonstrative, very anxious
and little disposed to compromise ; and they
bad for advocates aome of the mo it exper
fenced workers and most influential mon in tue
part. They were arnest and determined ; and
ttiey could ma e a most excellent showing for
tbtir resiectlve cities. Minneapolis was here
line an army with banners. The long whita
silk badges of the delegation were seen every
where, and the delegates would listen to no
suggestions of iossible defeat. They had
in their favor a great many things,
and to those who were insisting
npon the choice of Cincinnati or i'.i,
Louis, the suggestion that the climate of Min
nesota is delicious at that season of the year
came to the many who have not forgoiteu tho
discomforts which have attended political con
ventions in Ciucinu iti and Ht. Lou.. The sug-
f:ostlon of Minneapolis to them was like a cool
ireee from the north to those who have suf
fered from tho sirocdi. Besides. Minneapolis
offered au attraction in the form of secidllv
reduced rates to the Yellowstone l ai k to all irhb
would attend the convention. Omaha inaTTe a
strong bid, and was rewarded, to the sur
prise, probably, of the delegates from that city,
with the largest vote next to Chicago on the
first ballot,

CHARITY.
Let your charity begin at home, bat do
not let it stop there. II. Martyn.
A rich man without charity is a rogue;
and perhaps it would be no difficult matter
to prove that he is also a tool. Fielding.
In every relation of life we mast bear
and forbear; we mast not expect perfec
tion, and each party should carry the cloak
of charity for the other. iter. ii. Hug
gins. I have no respect for that self-boasting
charity which neglects all objects of com
miseration near and around it, but goes to
the end of the earth in search of misery
for the purpose of talking about it. (J.
Mason.
What Is Refinement.
One hears much talk of this desirable
quality nowadays, but the idea of it is often
very vague. What is refinement?
We are not speaking of those who think
that it consists of a studied quietness of
dress and manner. Some very refined peo
ple dress shockingly, and they even have
quite load voices, and yet their good breed
ing is patent to all the world.
We once met n whole family of delicate
ladies at a fashionable summer resort on
the banks of the Hudson, whose idea of
refinement was languor and ill-health.
They thought it was just too vulgar to be
healthy and strong; quite too mannish in
deed in a lady!
Among some people, size is thought to
have a good deal to do with refinement. It
is unrefined to be large, gross to be fat;
coorBe to have weight, and monetrons to
have prominent features. A large neck,
large cheeks or lips are especially opposed
to all refinement. -
Now, little people are certainly very cun
ning, very curious, but we can not all be
fairies nor do we wish it. Only fancy a
whole world of these little creatnres!
Why, even trade would languish. Smaller
ouantitios of everything would be needed,
, from cloth and flannel all the way down to
oysters and buckwheat cakes. No, large
' people are necessary to keep the world
moving.
I We once knew of a fashionable lady
who liked her clergyman because he
preached suc h refined sermons. When a
distinguished literary man died recently,
we were told he was not a refined person.
Well, perhaps he was not, but he was so
distinguished in other ways that really we
had not thought of his refinement We
would just as soon have asked whether St.
Paul was a refined man, or whether Isaiah
went to ancient Babylon to acquire "good
form," as some people go to London now
for that purpose.
There are, we believe, many people in
very humble stations in life who are truly
refined in their feelings who are quite nn-
right; "they have that consideration for
others which is the very basis of refine
ment. There are also others in good society
whose natural sweetness of disposition
constantly shows itself in kind and gentle
words and deeds toward all. No effort is
needed on their port to be courteous and
amiable, for they feel so, and naturally
their outward manners nro but the reflex
of that which is within. Sach persons are
charming; they like everybody and every
body likes them. We all know a few such,
and are thankful.
The chief desideratum seems to be a
good heart. If we truly love our neighbors
we can not fail to be kind and sweet to
them. And if we are indifferent, all the
care we take of our manners, all our
studied refinement, all our stylish conver
sation will be as dust and ashes. Home

Origin of the Screw.
It is not clearly known how far the
mechanical powers were known to the
ancients. There is no doubt that they
comprehended the lever, the wheel
and axle, and the pulley, and an ac
quaintance with the principlo of the
inclined plane seems to havo been
necessary to the Egyptians in moving
the huge blocks of ttono of which the
pyramids are built, Archimedes,
about 23U B. C, invented a pumping
screw, or spiral-shaped cylinder, for
raising water. The writings of this
mechanician and philosopher form the
clearest index we have to the extent of
knowledge we have of his time, and,
indeed, his own intelligence was so far
ahead of that of his contemporaries
that much of kin reasoning was not
fully established as a part of the
world's stock of knowledgo until cen
turies after his death. Apparently
Archimedes did not understand the in
clined plane, for he makes no direct
mention of it, and we have no evidence
to show that it was included in the
knowledge of mechanics possessed by
the ltomans. The true discovery of
the nse of the inclined plane dates
from the latter part of the sixteenth
century, when the miiids of men were
just awakening from their long sleep
during the dark ages. The discovery
is generally ascribed to Galileo, but
Stevinus, one of his contemporaries,
a mechanician of Holland, was the first
to explain in a treatise tho trne theory
of the power. The screw is the appli
cation of the inclined piano, as may be
seen by winding a triangular piece of
paper around a cylinder. The screw
and the wedge are alluded to by more
than one writer of the sixteenth centu
ry, showing that a knowledge of these
secondary powers formed a part of the
revival of physical science in which
Galileo too't a most important part, if
he did not wholly inspire it. The
principle of the screw propeller was
first enunciated by Hooke iu lf81,
though it was not successfully applied
to the movement of vessels until the
nineteenth century. The first nse of
the screw was in the screw-jack for
raising heavy weights. The various
modifications add applications of this
power belong to the era of mechanical
discovery in the present century. To

Nick Biddle was a wit as well as a
financier. During a session of the
rennsylvan:a Legislature away back
in the 40's a bill was up appropriating
a large sum for continuing the State
improvement An honest but unlearn
ed member from Berks County was
hostile to the bill, and, in fact, opposed
to all Btato improvements. He knew
(he wishes of his constituents, and lit
tle else. While the bill was nnder
consideration Mr. Biddle moved an
ironical amendment appropriating
$10,000 for the improvement of the
Alimentary Canal The member
from Berks was instantly on his feet
declaring his purpose to oppose any
appropriation for the Alimentary or
any other canal. The amendment was
instantly withdrawn, amidst the gen
eral mirth of the members at the ex
pense of the honest member from
Berks.
Formative Effect! or Different Kinds
or Athletic.
What the gymnasium is doing for the
strength and vigor of the masses in
some of our institutions of learning
may be inferred from a single illustra
tion taken from the records at Harvard
University.
In the year 1880, seven hundred and
seventy-six men were physically exam
ined. The strongest man out of this
number showed in strength of lungs,
bock, legs, chest and arms, as indicated
on the chart, a grand total of 075.2. At
the close of the summer term of the
present year, the highest strength test
recorded was 1,272.8, and there were
over two hundred men in collego whose
total strength test surpassed the high
est test of 1880. This general gym
nasium work is therefore reducing the
one-sided development once so common
with athletic specialists.
It must not be forgotten, however,
that there is a development peculiar to
the runner, jumper, wrestler, oarsman,
gymnast, ball-player, heavy-lifter, etc.,
and any one familiar with athletics at
the present day can aeily reooprniza ,
one of these specialists. The same
training that produced those matchless
specimens of human development em
bodied in the statues of the Gladiator,
the Athlete, Hercules, Apollo, and
Mercury of old, would' produce the
same results nnder similar circum
stances at the present time.
With every kind of physical exercise,
the qualities at first required are the
qualities at length developed. Speed
and endurance are required of the run
ner, and these are the qualities that
come to him by practice. In a like
manner, skill and activity come to the
gymnast and ball-player; and strength
and stability to the oarsman and weight
thrower. Most of these qualities are
accompanied by physical (haracter
istics. " If it were not for the recognized
tendency of certain exercises to pro
duce certain results, it would be impos
sible to prescribe special work for
individual cases. All mon, however,
who practice athletics for the same
length of time, and under similar con
ditions, do not attain identical results)
in their physical proportions or the
same degree of success in their athletic
achievements.
In order to illustrate some of the d's
tinguishing features that characterize
the development of successful athletes,
I have selected representative members
of the different athletic organizations
in the universities of Yale and Harvard,
a few of whom distinguished them
selves, within the last two years, by
breaking all previous college records
for certain events. The photographs
of these men, in spite of their dissimi
larity, show us certain characteristics
common to certain figures, and marked
peculiarities of another kind will ac
company others. Some of these char
acteristics are not readily detected by
the eye, but appear distinctly in the
charts. D. A. Sargent, M, D.; in
Stribner's Magazine.

"Rheumatism?
"Yes, Doctor. My shoulders ache,
and I can hardly raise my arms to my
head."
"It is bad weather for rheumatism."
"Why should it be?" queried the
nuflerer. "I haven't caught any cold.
I wore an overcoat, and the dampness
hasn't chilled me."
"Ill tell you why," answered the
physician, who is a well-known lectur
er in one of the leading medical col
leges of this city. "The dampness of
the atmosphere makes the air lighter.
This affects its pressuro on the body.
Of course that produces a temporary
disturbance of the system,"
"But why should that affect my
rheumatism?"
"Any disturbance of the system af
fects the most sensitive parts of a man.
If he has rheumatism it brings on
sharp pa ns; if he has corns or a bun
ion, those give him trouble, and if a
nerve is exposed in one I -Lie tath ha
is at once informed of that fact."
"Then there is really a reason for
those pains in damp weather."
"Indeed there is. To a buffer er from
such disorders there is no surer barom
eter in the world than his aching mem
bers. "New York Sun.
Speaking of "superfluous women,"
Mrs. Mary A. Livcrmore very aptly says:
"Yes, there are plenty of them, and of su
perfluous men also. But you will not al
ways find them among the unmarried.
They are superfluous women, who give
themselves to idle pleasure and morbid
fancy, and despise the activities of the age
in which they were born; who are so lack
ing in principle that they will accept any
man in marriage an octogenarian, an im
becile or a debauchee if his establishment
le satisfactory. Who, anchored in the
haven of ahnsband's love, and surrounded
by the evidences of his practical thought
fulness, become steeped in selfishness, and
make their whole life a hot pursuit of folly
and fashion, interested only in the whim
of the hour."
