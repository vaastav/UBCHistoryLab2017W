Farmer’s Associations
If farmers used their power of
tlionsrht as they do their muse e. thev
would be the most prosperous and sat
isfied clas- of people in these United
gta es The' would retain at the lowest
eptirmte thirtv perce..t more of the
wealth their industry creates than
tfcey. under the present condition of
afTihs do. They cou'd easily h mast
ers of th : s nations destiny when the
lumentah’e fact is. they allow them
ge:ves to he looked uprn and treated as
(J e moat insignificant factor of the
great comp nent parts which compose
<jpr bodv politic, or our social and
business fabric This insignifieent in
fluence exercised by the farming pop
ulation is mainly —in truth we might
sv altogether—owing to the isolated
condition which their business makes
it .convenient f r them to maintain
and which habit has cultivated through
generations, <>f a species of envious
jealon y which they hold to each other
One farmer wiH rarel” assist a brother
farmer to avoid being overreached by a
sba r per man in some otlier line of bus
iness. lull seems toenjov the discomfort
of his neighbor. This same contempt
ible feeling has kept farmers aloof from
organizations which were intended for
th.eir benefit and advancement, and
from looking with suspicion on every
effort of this kind thev have been
agiong die first to cry it down and join
in the scorn which those in a different
efill'ng have shown a cheerful alacrity

Earners are slowly mending in this
dßeetion but they lag sadly still. We
publish in our farm department some
points from lecture of Worthy Master
Darden, before the Natonal Grange
which nvt in Phi'adHphia last month
tjjpt contains valuable information, as
well ns encouraging facts. The grange
has been decried by the middle and
speculating c’ass from the dav the first
one was organized, and farmers as is
their uual custom, joined hea.tily in
and helped their own ridicule. But in
SO years the gnnge by its steadv work
to better the condition of the rural Hass
socially financially and intellectually,
has we'l nigh lived down its defamers.
and is steadily conquering the preju
dice of the more ignorant of the rural
class.
Where granges have been established
among an earn-st, intelligent class of
the agricultural population, and have
been fo>lunate in having men with
iome administrative ability to lead,
they have done a noble work for their
members. We have one such grange
id Cecil the Elkton Grange, and ought
toJiave more. There should be a grange
in the 6th dis'rict with its place of
meeting at Rising Bun. No greater
aid to our agricultural population
euuld he instituted than a live grang .
There are suftiei nt reasons why the
• early granges failed which do not ex-
Ft now to defeat their reestablishment
and if the Elkton grange wou d lend a
helping ban i, by some of its public
spirited members conferring with far
mers in litis section, a prosperous
grange might be established here this
winter. Tlte one wornd strengthen
the otlier, and farmers of Cecil might
thru their opportunity to a profitable
advantage n many directions. 'there
Uoue thing certain that farmers will
never secure their just share of the
wealth thev crede uutil they combine
la cioser ass ciatiou.
Tho Message.
The President’s message was de
ttrered to Congress on Monday,
there ie nothing of special interest
in the Buesa.e, the President having
w> very eUrtling facts to announce
THE MIDLAND JOUELTAL: DECEMBER 10, 1886.
or important plans to reveal. The
tn >"it important point is the adminis
tration antagonism to si ver and tlie
coinage act is recommended repealed
He doesn’t say a word, however,
about paying the debt- of the govern
ment and stopping interest witli the
Millions of silver dollars piled in the
vaults.
Mr Manning also tak s a whack t
the silver coinage law. He too ad
vises repeal of tiie silver coinage law
and recommends that the silver dol
lars he applied in paying of! the green
back d'bt of $34t3.651.01ri This
greenback “debt” as the Secretary
puts it draws no interest fiom tlie
i cop e and is Ihe only part of the
public debt, which benefits the people
as a circuiting medium The Presi
dent and Secretary arc anxious to pay
this debt with the si ver which they
refuse to pay otlier expenses of the
gov. rument with. or the interest
hearing debt. All except this green
back i/ebt is in the hands ot New
York capitalists where the Piesident
and his Secretary came from, and
tiie bonded debt is drawing int rest
from the pockets of labor Don’t pay
that deln with the si'ver Let it stand
for tiie sinking fund to slow y con
sumo in a hundred years or more. It
is a good interest paying investment
The bankers can use it as collateral
security to borrow money from the
treasurer on at one per cent to bank
w th while these collatera l bonds are
dr wing int- rest from the people’s
pockets at a rate of 3 and 4 per cent.
The 'egis atiyn recommended by
the President and his Secretary is all
in favor of Wall Street, as any one
can sec who will take the troub eto
read their messages to Congress.
There is a great outcry against the
“Mugwumps” and St. John for elect
ing Cleveland. Both were used to
some extent to rake the chestnuts
out of the fire, but Wall Street s ood
behind the scenes. They wanted a
Sew York administiat on and they
gut it. They had had such an ad
ministration all along. There has
not been a particle of change in the
policy of the administration, and the
change of parties was only a diver
sion to amu-e the public and draw
their attention fom the nianipu'a ing
power which commenced moulding
our national policy as suon as Lin
coin was dead, and it has been
moulded in the interest of capital
and against labor ever since, till the
country is well nigli governed by a
plutocracy in place of a detnoe acy.
We ask any one to study the drift ol
public affairs for the last 20 years
and reach any other conclusion if
possible.
Luxury at the Capital.
The “Society” season at Washing
ton. is on the eve of fairly opening in
a blaze of glory. The President’s
young wife is on tip toe to lead the
giddy whirl of “society” at the Cap
ital into tlte vortex of dissipation
and extravagance. The mad career
would have been in full headway ere
this, hut the death of ex-Prcsident
Arthur checked the rout. Tiie young
Mrs President generalisimo of the
social legions had all her plans ma
tured for the campaign when the ad
vance was suddenly called to halt
tiie flag over the White Hou-e lower
ed.to half mast (an ignorant mistake
uf national etiquete) and tiie fiddle
and the bow hung up tor 30 days.
The thirty days will soon have fled,
tiie emblems of mourning be hastily
and joyfully torn down, and the
reign of the goddess of mirth begun.
There is but one other Capital in
the Christian world that can equal
Washington in its society revelry,
which is London. Paris under the
Empire used to lead the world. There
the modiste, the demimond and the
cuissine reached the pinacle of their
ambition and gathered in the shekels.
The artist in designing and manu
lecturing rich and costly apparel,
and the no less genius who catered
to the taste of the gormond, laid tiie
world tiinier tribute to their art, ai d
the tens of thousand wlto lived by
his waste which the Imperial court
encouraged, was alway- a fast friend
and supporter of the Empire. But
now all this is changed in republi
can France, and the spirits hat pre
sided over Parisian revelry, have fled
to London and Washington—royal
London and democratic Washington!
These two capitals lead the world 'n
luxury and dissipation. Our demo
cratic law makers and presidents no
sooner reach this shrine of “society”
they call it now a days—they had
other names snore poetic in the old-
en times, when the heathen revelers
worship d stocks and stones.
As we remarked in the beginning
the young Presidentiss is all agio to
join the reyc ry, when one continu
ous round of* dinners,” “receptions”
“kettle drums” and “levees” will
turn nivht intoday at our plain dem
ocratic Capital,consuming the brains,
the strength, the time of President,
Cabinet, Senators, and 4 Representa
tives of the people !” There is no
president lives long after his exper
ience at the Capital. Arthur was a
hopeless week long before his time
had expired and went home simply
to die ! He knew it Two o'clock in
the morning seldom found him in
b.-d; but a round of parties, of sup
pers of “wine and wassail” in short,
consumed his evenings. And this
is the way they all follow. It is the
business of the shop keepers ot the
Capital to work for this state of dis
sipation at .Vashington as it was f.r
the same class to uphold the Empire
in Paris under the Third Napoleon.
This re gn of dissipation —for it
can be described p-operly by no oth
er name—is not conducive to repub
lican simplicity. But the evil is not
confined to this objection alone
The brains that are sent to the Cap
ital city to make and administer the
law- are consumed in dissipation.
Consumed, is the word, for a round
of not merely midnight,revelry, but of
all night dissipation that taxes and
exhausts the bram power which the
peop>e are paying so dearly for, to
be expended in their work of admin
istering affairs of state in a wise,
economical manner. Where reckless
dissipation and deep drinking make
such heavy draughts < n the brains
and physical powers of the people’s
servants, t hey are unfitted for per
forming properly, the duties they'
have sworn to give their bist efforts
to. The time of ,the President is
given up largely to holding recept
ions; people go in to shake hands
with the Pn si ent He stands for
hours every week with hundreds filing
pasc, shaking his hand who have no
business, whatever, with him, Dor
does he know whence they come or
whither they go. What greater piece
of folly could sensible people be
guilty of? It ought to require every
moment of time from needed rest
and sleep, of the President, to at
tend to his weighty nsponsibihties
He is paid SSO.OUU annually for tins
and a gorgeous mansion furnish
ed and provisioned lor his use.
The people’s business is necessarily
neglected under the baneful cust ms
which prevail at the Capital, and by
the medium of this c rrupted state of
society, the people have been robbed
of millions ot acres of the public do
main which are owned by British
nobles, who have it tarmed on the
tenant system, as they do in Ireland.
Tin se English Lords. Dukes and
Earls own who'e townships in the
western stdes which are worked un
der the tenant, system. The mischief
is manifold. Capital sends its agents
to Washington and in this mad
whirl of dissipation called “society”
the most villainous jobs are got thro’
Congress, and monopolies steal the
liber ies of the people and their
wealth through their debauched ser
vants Shall this state of things go
on without a protest, till a plutorc
raey pays no more regard to the
rights of the millions, than they pay
to the cattle in the farmer’s field?
Un'ess tie people turn their atten
tion to it it will. Un ess they learn
to know who and what they are vot
ing for it will. There is not one in
twenty knows what meaning is in
his vote. What work its power and
force are to be expended in execut
ing It is genera ly ued to despoil
the people of a portion of their
wealth and political power.
