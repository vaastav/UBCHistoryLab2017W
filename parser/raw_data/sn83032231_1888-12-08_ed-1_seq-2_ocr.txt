As U Democratic State Convention at
AIImUwb In 1887, when Hn. W. M. IUp
rtr vm among tlio leading candidates for
3 ait of tbt Bnpremo Court, tlicro was a
sirens content made for the nomination.
Ctmeraiiman Scott carried Ilia day for
kl faTorlto. J. Ron Thompson, of Etlc,
ad in tha list of eight distinguished men
Xt. Rapihar then stood third highest-a
few said ha was fourth. Bat bo this as It
ay. It Is certain that this year Mr. Rap
Aw could have easily tuado tlio nomination
as u his former competitors were out of
tha race. Thar were no candidates this
jtar except Jiidse McCullom, of Susque
hanna caunty, and he was not anxious for
tha nomination. Tha chances of being
elected were, of course, Terr allm. But
had Mr. Bapsher taken the nomination ha
tfonli to-day be Judge elect of the Supreme
Caurt of fennsylranla, because soon after
tka aamlnatlon was made, one of tlio
Jndfea of the Bupreme Court (Judge Trun
key) auddenly died. Tnls left two vacan
clae ta be filled, and the new constitution
mlitn In nrh rami that both the Demo-
otitic and Keoubllcan candidates should be par excellence,
elactai. That Is.tbat each toter could vote
far only one candidate. Judges McCullom
end Mitchell will therefore both take their
Mtt on tha Supreme Bench on the first
JfoBday of January next. This would
kara been a- nlca plum for our former
twfltman, If lie had been In the field as a
(.ndldtte, as the salary Is 8,000 a year
amd mlleage.and tha term twenty-one years.
Out foreign relations are disposed of by
tlio statement that all pending difficulties
are capable of satisfactory adjustment.
Nothing Is added to the expressions of
former messages respecting Canadian or
British questions, excepting with regard to
Lord Sackvllle'a "unpardonable conduct In
his Interference with tne suffrage of Ameri
can citizens and Ills subsequent public de
clarations Impugning tlio Executlvoand
Senate of the United Stttes, In connection
with Important questions now pending In

A revision of the naturalization and pass

abuse of the privileges of citizenship, and
"such a reorganization of the consular fee

Ijrj yes, the organization has decreased In

(rvatlva, honest and patriotic members
Ik arganlzatton is far better off than with
a nambershlp twice as large, one-half of

Membership has decreased, and of the mis

tkay have profited through eriors of the

for thla labor organization.
Two singular lawsuits took place hero
this week, very unique in character, In one
caso the son sues his father for stealing,
and in the other the father attaches his
son's property for debt. John R. Andrews,
or Jack Andrews as ho was farmlliarly
known about town, was one of the best
knowu brokers In New York, A clubman
first ntgbtcr always,
lover of good things and good fellows, and
a general howling swell, Jack floated along
on the surface rf society, enjoying all of Its
sweets and escaping more of Its sours than
any fellow within my ken. A member of a
popular firm of Wall street brokers, with a
seat worth twenty-five thousand dollars in
the Stock Exchange, he zathered In his
shekels In the way of commissions sufllcl
ent for all of his earthly wants with a fow
dollars to spare for a needy friend, for
Jack's purso strings were never drawn
when any of bjs chums were a little short.
Besides bis commissions Jack occasional!
took a Utile flyer on his own account, an
bo had somo outside business ventures just
to keep the pot a bllln'. Among other
speculations he took some stock iu Tiffany
& Co.'s, the great jewelers, to the amount'
of two hundred thousand dollars, and be'
lng short fifty thousands he raised it from
his father, giving as security certificates ot
Tiffany stock to the amount of one nun
dred thousand dollars. After a time Jack
called upon his father and asked him to let
him liaye the hundred thousand dollar cer

One bright afternoon ten can Ago , hRVB(jtfprcj ft rpwaril of S2,.100 for the ar-
ho stepped out of his house, kissing his
young wife at the doorstep, and from lhav
time till a week ago he might have been
sunk in tho sea. In a few weeks the girl
wife suddenly disappeared, and tbo neigh
bors all said that In a fit of desperation at
losing her husband she had made away
with herself, and In. a short time the pair
were entirely forgotten, Last week a well
known lawjer called on a gentleman oc
cupying a comfortable position It) the Ei le
railroad offices, and asked him It ho was
not tho man who had deserted his wife ten
years bcfoie, and being confronted with the
proofs be admitted that ho was. In the
meantime ho had married again and was
the father of four children. Tbo .lawyer
asked him how he came to marry havlug
another wife living, but he Informed his
questioner tbat his wife was dead and that
he had tho Information from her sister, In
whoso arms sbo died in New Orleans live
orslx years before. The lawyer appeared
satisfied but asked him to meet him at his
olllce next day when be broucht him and
his first wifo faco to face. The husband
Was thunderstruck; his second wife was
lost to him and his children might be de
clared Illegitimate, lie begged for mercy,
but the wire was in no merciful mood and
threatened to land him in State's l'll&on for
bigamy. At last It was agreed that lie
should pay her fivo dollars a week, the
money to bescnt to the General Post Office,
as tho first wife refused to- gtye her address
or to tell anything about herself. The
money was paid foi several weeks and 'hen
the husband shadowed her with detectives,
and after a long hunt found her lit lng with
u lawyer who was once a friend of his, and
who has been passing bfcr ns bis wife for
the last eight j ears. The couple were liv
ing In excellent style and the freak that
took possession of the deserted wife appears
to have been of revenge at finding her
former husband so happy with another
affinity, though she bad consoled herself by
taking another husband. As It looks now
she will be lucky If she escapes States Prison
for bigamy herself, the only thing
that can save her Is the absenco of the
second marriage certificate and of that
there appears to be somo doubt.
It is with pride and pleasure that I record
that this week we have been honored on
tbo presence of that aristocratic pug "the
rest and conviction of tho mnrdcrcr of
Bernard Jfct.afferty, of Mnhonoy City. A
similar rewHid Is offered for the apprehen
sion of the murderer of George Haines, of
St. Clair, Thecfilcersnic still without a
clue as to tho perpetrators of cither deed.
The hands of kcvcral departments In
the Beading Iron Works at Reading have
been discharged as a preliminary step to
ward reducing expenses.

It vax n souEWHAT onATiryisa to
stay Democrats to know that though
Graver Cleveland was defeated for the Pre-
aldeaey on the Otb of November, yet never
theless he has a popular majority oyer
Banjamla Harrlsan of 70,000 to 80,000.
Xarriion carried twenty states out of tne
tklrty-elght. This being the case it Is not
ValUikjely that the present agitation of

mew Republican government.
THE PRESIDENT MESSAGE.
la his communication to Congress one
year ago Prasldant Cleveland devoted more
jpe to a tingle feature than bo now gives
to all the subjects to which he directs the
ttttntlon of Congress. The tariff and sur
pins are now disposed of In about a column
vhlle tha entire message occupies nearly
eight columns.
Respecting tariff,. Mr. Cleveland docs not
asedlfy hi proposition of last December.
or do ha see in the result of the late
election reason to despair of the ultimate
triumph of the principles he champions.
HI views are tersely summarized in this
xpratsisn:
The cause for which the battle is waged
1 eamprlsed within lines clearly and dis
tinctly defined. It should never be com
promised. It Is tba people's causa,
Thl declaration Is followed b.r a rebuke
t the spirit af paternalism which "would
sake the general Government the fountain
af Individual and private aid," and would
dispense with "the usual rules and Umlta
tlaa ot business principles and just dealing
S agalnit th Goyernment and In favor of
jrlvata claim." The President enters a
Strang protest against tha Idea that claims
should ba allowed that are "supported b
a better consideration than the wealth of
tba Government and the poverty of the
claimant," and he Insist tbat publlr need
tad necessities should be the criterion of
expenditure on public buildings and other
faiproveraent.

father tried to attach his seat in the Stock
Exchange, which is only worth twenty-two
thousand, and as there are no more avail
able assets In sight, It now looks as though
the old man would be out twenty-eight
thousand dollars and Interest. Fortunately
be can stand It vitbout being hurt, but the
whole story Is a beautiful Illustration of
that homely adage, "with a twist, "Uring &
child up in the way he should go, and when
ho grows old ho'll go it."
The other case was of a young hopeful
who tried to beat his father out of his
board, but there were no flies ou" the old
gentleman and he wouldn't have it. The
boy, who was only eighteen years old, had
spent all bis'spare change on a swell over
coat, and he Informed the old mm that he
must hang up the board bill. Tho old man
seized the overcoat and locked It up,
swearing by the big boot that ho should
not wear It till be paid his board. Straight
way young hopeful went to tho Court and
swore out a warrant for the kreeuy of his
coat. He did not mention to the presiding
judge that tho criminal was his father.
You can hardly conceive the judge's amaze
ment when ho discovered who the accused
was. The case was at once dismissed, and
the sitting magistrate would have sent the
young scamp up for ten years If he had had
jurisdiction In the case; as It was, he gave
him such a raking down that I hardly think
he will ever try that experiment again.
This week a lunch took place here which
promises to work a complete revolution,
In ocean navigation, and If the claims ot
the Inventors of the machinery in the new
vessel are to bo believed we may expect to
seo ships dashing across the ocean with the
speed of a railroad train, and tin ee days be
tween here and Liverpool will be consid
ered ordinary schedule time. The Eureka
was built as an experiment, the new power
being gas with a mixture of common air
exploded by electricity directly against the
water thereby doing away with paddles or
propellers, and bavlng a power more con
trolable aud far less .dangerous than steam
Tbo only fire used Is for vaporizing tho pet
roleum out of which the gas is made, and
tnls supply of fuel only occupies a vury
small portion of the vessel. If it is the
success that its projectors hope it will revo
lutionize the river and ocean carriages of
the not Id.

six days thereafter the aforesaid loughs
will plod, and plod, and plod to the las.,
strain of human endurance, aud when tbelr
legs are swollen and tbelr bodies are sore
some pickpocket or prize fisbting pug will
be called upon to award them the co-called
champion's belt which, six weeks after,
you may expect to see adorning the bar of
some low groggery or In a pawnbroker's
window in the Uowcry. We have had many
of these exhibitions tn this city in the past
few years, and they have always been a
shame and disgrace. They bring together
tho very vilest class of the community, and
on the last two days you can generally find
there the principal thieves, gamblers and
harlots In the city. In the paper spoken of

A PHYSICIAN'S LETTER.
' 4 Gentlemen : I am glad to write you my opinion of 'Ivory
Soap,' and have long intended doing so.
It has become a household necessity with us.
If there is an unusually obstinate spot on the clothing, on the wood
work, an ink daub on my desk cover; a polish required for the door
plate or surgical instruments, a cleansing and harmless preparation for
the teeth, and a very superior toilet soap needed, we resort to 'Ivory.'
We buy it by the box, remove the wrappers, and allow the soap to
thoroughly ripen.
Now, if I had saved fifteen wrappers I would ask yon to rend my
little girl a drawing book in accordance with your nffer in the Youth's
Companion; but as it is, we all feel under obligation to you for manu
facturing 'Ivory Soap' for us.
We do not hesitate to recommend it unqualifiedly to all our friends.
It is one of the few ai tides that will do what it is advertised to do."
A WORD OF WARNING.
Thcro are many white soaps, each represented to be "just as good as the 1 Ivory')"
they ARE NOT, but like all counterfeits, lack the peculiar and remarkable qualities of
the genuine. Ask for "Ivory" Soap and insist upon getting It,
