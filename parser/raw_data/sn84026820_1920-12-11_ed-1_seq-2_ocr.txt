STEPS TO MEET
Wilson's Program in Message
Sent to Congress
AVOIDS LEAGUE OF NATIONS
Washington.—Both houses of Con
gress were in brief session to hear
President Wilson's annual message. It
was read by the clerk, Mr. Wilson hav -1
ing heeded the advice of his physician
not to appear in person to present his
both Senate and House

recommendations.
Galleries in
were crowded,
the chance that the President might
appear in person or by the possibility
that his message might touch upon
the League of Nations question or his
own approaching retirement to private
life were disappointed.
Mr. Wilson confined himself almost
wholly to domestic questions. Only
by inference did his message refer to
the nearing close of his administra
tion and that was in the concluding
paragraph. The proposals he present
cd, the President wrote, were not so
much a series of recommendations as
a confession "of the faith in which 1
was bred and which it is my solemn
purpose to stand by until my last
lighting day."
Aside from hearing the President's
message, Congress made definite prog
ress on at least one of the problems it
faces during the brief session. The
House received a rule under which
an effort will be made to take up the
immigration bill for prompt action. It
would limit general debate to four
hours. A two-day interval was al-,
lowed to permit Representative Siegel,
of New York, a member of the im
migration committee, to frame a
minority report.
No other matter in cither house
has parted beyond the committ' o
stage. At both end3 of the Capitol,
however, members were deep in plans
to deal with business depression, un
employmjpt and farmers' relief. Dis
cussions in the Senate of the plight of
farmers delayed the reading of the
President's message hut hat body.
, The industrial situation also found
a place in the President's- message.
Recovery from war effects gave prom
ise of early completion "only in our
own forfunate country," Mr. Wilson
said, and even here "halts and is im
peded at times." A program of "im
mediately serviceable aots of legisla
; tion" to aid that recovery "and prove
the indestructible recuperative force
I of a great government of the people"
, should be undertaken, Mr. Wilson said,
I adding:
"One of these is to prove that a
great democracy can keep house as
I successfully and in as business-like
fashion as any other government."
First among the recommended steps
Mr. Wilson placed enactment of a
: "workable budget system." He said
! he had vetoed the budget bill passed
I at the last session "reluctantly" and
because of "a constitutional objec
! tion," but as it was later revised in
, the House, he believed it would, with
: other measures, furnish "foundations
for a national budget system."
Mr. Wilson cited figures as to the
national debt and urged "rigid econ
; orav," in which ail branches of the
! government should co-operate.
"I cannot over-emphasize," he said,
j "the necessity of economy in govern
, ment appropriations and expenditures
It and the avoidance by Congress of
-1 practices which take money from the
Treasury by indefinite or revolving
his fiind appropriations."
j "This year's estimates 'strikingly'
j illustrated,, the importance of specific
by appropriations, the President added,
the Transportation Act having 'dis
turbed' the relationship between cur
rent receipts and expenditures to the
extent of over a billion dollars.
"It is obvious," the message con
tinued, "that these large payments
have already seriously limited the gov
1 ernment's progress in retiring the
1 floating debt."
The President renewed some of the
to
j
j recommendations he made at the
opening of the last session; and added:
"I do not feel it my privilege at
|
so ]
as \ P resent t0 suggest the detailed and
1 ; p ar ^ cu l ar methods by which these ob
i ec ^ s ma y be attained, but I have
faith that the inquiries of your sev

The only recommendations for'other
than domestic matters was that for a

through American commissioners to
avoid "further tempting opportunities"

promises to the people of those is

legislation which he said would put

Text of the Message.
Following Is the text of the Presi
dent's message:
When I addressed myself to per
forming the duty laid upon the Presi
dent by the Constitution to present to
you an annual report on the state of
the Union I found myself dominated
by an immortal sentence of Abraham
Lincoln's, "Let us have faith tbat right
makes might, and in that faith let us
dure to do our duty as we understand
It," a sentence Immortal because it
embodies In a form of utter simplicity
and purity tbe essential state of tbe
nation, the faith in which it was con
ceived and the faith in which it has
grown to glory and power.
Faith Which Defeated Germany.
With that faith and the birth of a
nation founded upon it came the hope
Into the world that a new order would
prevail throughout the affairs of man
kind, an order In which reason und
right would take precedence of covet
ousness and force, and I believe that I
express the wish and purpose of every
thoughtful American when I say that
this sentence marks for us in tlje
plainest manner tbe part we should
play alike in the arrangements of our
domestic affairs and in our exercise
of influence upon the affairs of the
world. By this faith and by this faitli
alone can the world be lifted out of
Its present confusion and despair.
It was tills faith which prevailed
over the wicked force of Germany.
You will remember that the beginning
of the end of the war came when the
German people found themselves face
to face with the conscience of the
world and realized that right was ev
erywhere arrayed against the wrong
that their government was attempting
to perpetrate. I think, therefore, that
it is true to say that this was the faith
which won the war. Certainly this is
the faith with which our gallant men
went into the field and out upon the
seas to make sure of victory.
This is the mission upon which de
mocracy came into the world. Democ
racy Is an assertion of the right of the
individual to live and to be treated
justly as against any attempt on the
part of any combination of individuals
to make laws which will overburden
him or which will destroy his equality
among his fellows in the matter of right
or privilege, and I think we all realize
that tbe day has coine when democracy
is being put upon its final test. The
old world Is just now suffering from a
wanton rejection of the principle of
democracy and a substitution of the
principle of autocracy as asserted in
the name, but without tbe authority
and sanction of the multitude. This is
the time of all others when democra
cy should prove its purity and its spir
itual power to prevàil. It is surely the
manifest destiny of the United States
to lead in the attempt to make this
spiuit prevail.
«
a
a
United States as Example.
There are two ways which the
United States can assist to accomplish
this great object : First, by offering the
example within her own borders of the
will and power of democracy to make
and enforce laws which are unques
tionably just and which are equal to
their administration—laws which se
cure its full right to labor and yet at
tbe same time safeguard the integrity
of property, and particularly of that
property which is devoted to the de
velopment of industry and the increase
of the necessary wealth of the world.
Second, by standing for right and Jus
tice as towards individual nations. Tlie
law of democracy is for the protection
of the weak, and the influence of every
democracy In the world should be for
the protection of the weak nation, the
nation which is struggling towards its
right and towards its proper recogni
tion and privilege In the family of na
tions.
The United States cannot refuse this
role of champion without putting the
etigma of rejection upon the great and
devoted men who brought its govern
ment into existence an,d established it
In the face of almost universal opposi
tion and intrigue, even in the face of
wanton force, as, for example, against
the orders In coundl of Great Britain
and the arbitrary Napoleonic decrees
which involved us in what we know
as the War of 1812.
I urge you to consider that the dis
play of an immediate disposition on
the part of the Congress to remedy any
Injustices or evils that may have shown
themselves in our national life will af
ford the most effectual offset to the
forces of chaos and tyranny which are
playing so disastrous a part in the for
tunes of the free peoples of more than
one part of the world. The United
States is of necessity the sample de
mocracy of the world, and the triumph
of democracy depends upon its suc
cess.

we ought to attempt, to assist that

the
tion
to. prove that a. great democracy can
keep house as successfully and In as
businesslike a fashion as any other
government. It seems to me that the
first step towards proving this is to
supply ourselves with a systematic
method of handling our estimates and
expenditures and bringing them to tbe
point where they will not be an un
necessary strain upon our Income or
necessitate unreasonable taxation. In
other words, a workable budget sys
tem, and I respectfully suggest that
two elements are essential to such a
system ; namely, not only that the
proposal of appropriations should be
in the hdnds of a single body, such
as a single appropriations committee
in each house of the Congress, but
also that this body should be brought
Into such co-operation with the de
partments of the government and with
the treasury of the United States as
would enable it to act upon a com
plete conspectus of the needs of the
government and the resources from
which it must draw its income.
I reluctantly vetoed the budget bill
passed by the last session of the Con
giSss because Of a constitutional ob
jection. The house of representatives
subsequently modified the bill in order
to meet this objection. In the revised
form I believe that the bill, coupled
with action already taken by the Con
gress to revise its rules and proced
ure, furnishes the foundations for an
effective national budget system. 1
earnestly hope, therefore, that one of
the first steps taken by the present
session of the Congress will be to
pass the budget bill.
The nation's finances have shown
marked improvement during the last
year. The total ordinary receipts of
$6,594,000,000 for the fiscal year 1920 j
exceeded those for 1919 by $1,542,000,
000, while the total net ordinary ex
penditures decreased from $18,514,
000,000 to $6,403,000,000. The gross
public debt, which reached its highest
point on August 31, 1919, when It was
$26,596,000,000, had dropped on Novem
ber 30, 1920, to $24,175,000,000. There
has also been a marked decrease in
holdings of government war securities
by the banking institutions of the
country, as well as in the amount of
bills held by the Federal Reserve
bnnks secured by government war ob
ligations. This fortunate result has
relieved the banks and left them freer
to finance the needs of agriculture, in
dustry and commerce.
It has been due in large part to the
reduction of the i ublic debt, especially
of the floating debt, but more particu
larly to the improved distribution of
government securities among perma
nent Investors. The cessation of the
government's borrowings except
through short term certificates of in
debtedness has been a matter of great
consequence to the people of the coun
try at large, as well as to the holders
of Liberty bonds and Victory notes,
and has had an important bearing on
the matter of effective credit control.
The year has been characterized by
the progressive withdrawal of the
treasury from the domestic credit mar
iât and from a position of dominant
influence in hat market. The future
course will necessarily depend upon
the extent to which economies
practiced and upon the burdens placed
upon the treasury as well ns upon in
dustrial developments and the main
tenance of tax receipts at a sufficiently
high level.

are
Seven and One-half Billions in Bonds
Mature.
The fundamental fact which at pres
ent dominates the government's finan
cial situation is that seven and a half
billions of its war indebtedness mature
within the next two and a half years.
Of this amount, two and a half billions
are floating debt and five billions Vic
tory notes and War Savings Certifi
cates. The fiscal program of the gov
ernment must be determined with ref
erence to these maturities. Sound poli
cy demands that government expendi
tures be reduced to the lowest amount
which will permit the various services
to operate efficiently and that govern
ment receipts from taxes and salvage
be maintained sufficiently high to pro
vide for current requirements, includ
ing interest and sinking fund charges
on the public debt, and at the same
time retire the floating debt and part
of the Victory loan before maturity.
With rigid economy, vigorous salvage
operations and adequate revenues from
taxation, a surplus of current receipts
over current expenditures can be real
ized and should be applied to the float
ing debt. All branches of the govern
ment should co-operate to see that this
program is realized.
Makes Plea for Economy.
I cannot overemphasize the necessity
of economy In government appropria
tions and expenditures and the avoid
ance by the Congress of practices
which take money from the treasury
by indefinite or revolving fund appro
priations. The estimates for the pres
ent year show that over a billion dol
lars of expenditures were authorized
by the last Congress in addition to the
amounts shown in the usual compiled
statements of appropriations,
strikingly illustrates the importance of
making direct and specific appropria
tions. The relation between the cur

of the government during the present
fiscal year, ns well as during the last
half of the last fiscal year, lias been
disturbed by the extraordinary burdens
thrown upon the treasury by the trans
portation act, in connection with the
return of the railroads to private con
trol. Over $600,000,000 lias already
been paid to the railroads under tills
net—$350,000,000 during the present
fiscal year; and it Is estimated that
further payments aggregating possi
bly $650,000,000 must still be made to
the railroads during the current year,
It is obvious that these large payments
have already seriously limited the gov

ernment's progress in retiring the Host
ing debt.
Closely connected with these. It
seems to me, is the necessity for an
immediate consideration of the revi
sion of our tax laws. Simplification
of the income and profits taxes has
become an immediate necessity. These
taxes performed an indispensable serv
ice during the war. The need fpr their
simplification, however, Is very great,
in order to save the taxpayer incon
venience and expense and in order to
make his liability more certain and
definite. Other and more detailed rec
ommendations with regard to taxes
will no doubt be laid before you by the
Secretary of the Treasury and the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
It is my privilege to draw to the
attention of Congress for very sympa
thetic consideration the problem of
providing adequate facilities for the
care and treatment of former mem
bers of the military and naval forces
who are sick or disabled as the result
of their- participation in the war.
These heroic men can never be paid
in money for the service they patriot
ically rendered the nation.
Their reward will lie rather in real
ization of the fact that they vindicated
the rights of their country and aided
in safeguarding civilization. The na
tion's gratitude must be effectively re
vealed to them by the most ample pro
vision for their medical care and treat
ment as well as for their vocational
training and placement.
The time has come when a more
complete program can be formulated
and more satisfactorily administered
for their treatment and training, and
I earnestly urge that the Congress give
the matter its early consideration.
The Secretary of the Treasury and
tbe Board of Vocational Education
will outline in their annunl reports
proposals covering medical care and
rehabilitation which I am sure will
engage your earnest study and com
mand your most generous support.
Permit me to emphasize once more
the need for action upon certain mat
ters upon which I dwelt ut some length
in my message to the second session
of the Sixty-sixth Congress. The ne
cessity, for example, of encouraging
the manufacture of dyestuffs and re
lated chemicals, the importance of do
ing everything possible to promote ag
ricultural production along economic
lines, to improve agricultural market
ing and to make rural life more at
tractive and heulthful ; the need for a
law regulating cold storage in such a
way as to limit the time during which
goods may be kept In storage, prescrib
ing the method of disposing of them
if kept beyond the permitted period,
and requiring goods released from
storage in all cases to bear the date of
their receipt.
It would also be most serviceable If
It wei^e provided that all goods releas
ed from cold : torage for Interstate
shipment should have plainly marked
upon each package the selling or mar
ket price at which they went into
storage, in order that the purchaser
might be able to learn what profits
stood between him and the producer
or the wholesale dealer. Indeed, it
would be very serviceable to the pub
lic if all goods destined for interstate
commerce were made to carry upon
every packing case whose f< m made
it possible a plain statement of the
price at which they left the hands of
the producer. I respectfully call your
attention also to thi recommendations
of the message referred to with regard
to a Federal license for all corpor t
tions engaged in interstate commerce.
Wants Labor Legislation.
In brief, the immediate legislative
need of the time is the removal of all
obstacles to be realization of the best
ambitions of uir people in their sev
eral dusses of employment and the
strengthening of all instrumentalities
by which difficulties are to be met aud
removed and justice dealt out, wheth
er by law or by some form of media
tion and conciliation. I do not feel
it to be my privilege at present to
suggest the detailed and particular
methods by which these objects may
be attained, but I hnve faith that the
inquiries of your several committees
will discover the way and the method.
In response to what I believe to be
the impulse of sympathy and opinion
throughout the United States, I ear
nestly suggest that the Congress au
thorize the treasury of the United
States to make to the struggling gov
ernment of Armenia such a loan as
wns made to several of the allied gov
ernments during the war, and I would
also suggest that it would be desirable
to provide in the legislation itself that
the expenditure of the money ihus
loaned should be under the supervision
of a commission, or at least a commis
sioner, from the United States, in or
der that revolutionary teirdencles with
in Armenia itself might not be afforded
by the loan a further tempting oppor
tunity.
Allow me to call your attention to
the fact the people of the Philippine
Islands have succeeded in maintaining
a stable government since the last ac
tion of the Congress In their behalf,
and have thus fulfilled the condition
set by the Congress as precedent to a
consideration of granting Independence
to the islands. I respectfully submit
that this condition precedent having
been fulfilled, it is now our liberty and
our duty to keep our promise to the
people of those Islands by granting
them the independence which they so
honorably covet.
I have not so much laid before you
a series of recommendations, gentle
men, as sought to utter a confession of
faith—of the faith in which I was bred
and which it is my solemn purpose to
stand by until my last fighting day. I
believe this to be the faith of America
—the faith of the future—and of all
the victories which await national ac
tion in the day;, to come, whether in '
America or elsewhere.
