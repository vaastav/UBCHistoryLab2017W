Death of Judge McGinnis, Probate
Judge of Yellowstone County,
at Billings.
The sad and sudden announcement of
the death of John McGinnis, Probate
Judge of Yellowstone county, on yesterday
was a grievous surprise to his many friends
throughout the Territory. It seems but a
short time since we met our brother in
Grand Lodge at Missoula, where he repre
sented Ashler Lodge, as its Worshipful
Master. His devoted and accomplished
wife was then present with him, and Mac
was the picture of health, with as good a
promise of length of days as any of those
in attendance. As expressive of the con
sideration in which he was held at home
by those who know him best, without re
gard to party associations, we append the
following resolutions adopted by the Board
of Commissioners of Yellowstone connty:
Whereas, We have just learned with
profound sorrow and regret, of the sudden
and untimely death of the Hon. John Mc
Ginnis, probate judge of the county, and
Whereas, In John McGinnis we have
always found an able lawyer, an honest
and faithful, a courteous and obliging gen
tleman and a valuable citizen, and
Whereas, In his death his family have
lost a tender husband and father, and the
citizens of Billings and Yellowstone coun
ty a faithful public servant, therefore
Resolved, That we the board of connty
commissioners of Yellowstone county in reg
ular session do tender to the bereaved
widow and children o. the late John Mc
Ginnis, our ^heartfelt sympathy in their
sad and sudden allliction, and as a mark of
respect to the memory of the deceased, it is
hereby ordered that the probate court of
Yellowstone county be draped in mourn
ing for the space of thirty day from this
date, and that this board now adjourn, and,
Resolved, That the clerk of this board be
and is hereby instructed to transmit a copy
of these resolutions to the Billings Gazette
and an engrossed copy to the widow of the
deceased. (Signed )

BIG CATTLE CASE.
^Lbo
^Wthi
Judgment of Three-Quarters of a
Million Dollars Against the
North Montana Cattle
Company.
[Great Falls Tribune, Dec. 4.]
The Farmers Loan and Trust company
sues to foreclose a mortgage given to it as
trustee for bondholders of the North Mon
tana Cattle company for alleged breaches
of the terms of the mortgage. The bonds
issued by the cattle company are $750,000
in amount and are held by the Farme rs'
Loan and Trust company of New York.
The breaches alleged are failure to keep
defendants herd up to 22,000 head as
agreed and failure to pay interest on the
nds, and the sale of cattle to diminish
he number. The defendants demurred to
the complaint on the ground that the suit
was prematurely brought, claiming that no
snit to foreclose could be brought until 12
mouths after the interest was due and that
no default was made until January, 1888.
The court overrnled this demurrer and
the case went to trial yesterday. The
plaintiff called two witnesses and intro
duced record evidence. The defendant
moved for a non suit on the grounds that
no preach was proved, the herd having
been reduced by severity of the winters in
1886-7 and not by sale. The defendants
stand on the demurrer and motion for non
suit. The court has taken the case under
advisement.
Among the people interested in the
North Montana Cattle company are Rus
sel B. Harrison, son of the Peeident-elect;
W. H. H. Miller, General Harrison's
law partner; J. C. Johnson, lawyer, Wash
ington;'John 8. Bain and J. K. McCammon.
The two last named lawyers were
formerly assistant attorney generals of the
United States. The company was formed
in Jane, 1886, and issued the bonds in
question to take np the indebtedness of the
Montana Cattle Company, to whose busi
ness it succeeded. Chumasero & Mc
Cutcheon and E. W. Toole are counsel for
the Farmers' Loan & Trust Company;
Carpenter, Back & Hnnt for the North
Montana Cattle Company. Judge Chuma
sero, Messrs. £. W. Toole, Hunt and Back
are all here.
Judge Bach gave a decree to-day for the
full amount of the mortgage, namely, $750,
000 and interest.

THE STRIKE ENDED.
The Bone of Contention Resigns and
the Engineers of the Montnna
Union go Back to
Work.
Butte, December 7.—[Special to the
Herald.]—The Montana Union strike is
ended aud the engineers have gone back
to work. The result was brought
about by the resignation of Mas
ter Mechanic Ross, whœe discharge
the strikers had demanded of Supt. Dick
inson, whose delay in not at once conced
ing to this demand, caused the strike.
Yesterday Superintendent Dickinson in
formed the engineers that Ross had re
signed, and that Mr. Hickey was now mas
ter mechanic, and that he, the superinten
dent, was willing to have all the strik
ers except four go back to work.
Superintendent Dickinson also sent in
bis own resignation to headquarters yester
day, thus leaving Marcus Daly in charge
of the road. An agreement was finally
made last evening by which the strike was
declared off and 26 oat of the 27 strikers
went back to work. Trains are now rnn
n'ng on timejand no farther trouble is ap
prehended.
Previous to the orders from Mr. Haggin
received yesterday, ordering the closing
down of the Anaconda plant, the engineers
of that company had made arrangements
with the Montana Union strikers to ran
the engines themselves between Batte and
Anaconda in order that the ore shipments to
that smelter might be kept np. Bat as soon
as Mr. Haggin's telegram was received, this
plan was abandoned and no ore is being
shipped. The opinion is expressed that
Mr. Haggin would countermand his order
as soon as the [strike was settled, but this
is not probable, as the fires have all been
drawn from the fnrnaces and the entire
work suspended, which wonld not have
been done, had there been any intention of
resuming in a few days.
S STERLING SWORDED.
The Captain of Schuyler Colfax Can
ton Presented With a Sword.
About twenty members of Canton
Schuyler Colfax, Patriarchs Militant, I. O.
O. F., assembled last evening at the resi
dence of their captain, Judge F. P. Ster
ling, where they were given a cordial wel
come by the host and hostess.
After an honr of social enjoyment, Lient.
Col. R. H. Beckwith corraled Captain Ster
ling in the parlor and presented him with
a handsome sword of polished steel, with
a scabbard and hilt ornamented with gold
and silver. The name "F. P. Sterling" was
engraved on the blade and on the scabbard
was the inscription "Canton Schuyler Col
fax, No. 1, to Capt. F. P. Sterling.".
Col. Beckwith accompanied the donation
with an appropriate presentation speech,
in which he recounted the devoted
attention and earnest work done
by Captain Sterling in promoting the
good ot the order and drilling the Canton
In recognition of his services and the high
estimation in which he was held by his
fellow members, they had determined to
present him with a testimonial in the
sword. Captain Sterling, though taken by
surprise, responded in a fitting manner,
returning his hearty thanks to the Canton,
whom it was his pleasnre to command.
Col. J. P. McCabe then turned to Mrs.
Sterling and with dne formality invested
that lady with the Degree of Chivalry in
the order. The guests were then invited
into the dining room, where they were
regaled with refreshments provided by the
host and hostess, and later took their de
parture with the pleasantest recollections
of the occasion.
Endorsement of Pastor Hewitt.
The Presbytery recently in session at
Emporia, Kansas, adopted resolutions high
ly complimentary to Rev. J. D. Hewitt,
formerly pastor of the Fifth Avenue Pres
byterian chnrch, Helena. The following
is an extract from the report of the Pres
bytery committee :
"The Presbytery of Emporia with great
reluctance consents to the dissolution of
the pastoral relations now existing between
Rev. J. D. Hewitt and the First Presby
terian chnrch of Wichita. These relations
were formed in 1879. With a single ex
ception it is the longest pastorate now on
oar rolls. It has been a phenomenally suc
cessful one. Brother Hewitt came to a
chnrch of 150 members. He leaves it with
more than 500 members, strong, aggressive
and of commanding influence.
*******
We commend him and hia cause to
the generous confidence of God's people
everywhere We trnst that he may be
spared to the full realization of his most
sanguine expectations in regard to this
academy. In the meantime we rejoice to
know that the bonds which have bound ns
together as Presbyters are not to be sun
dered. The labors that have contributed
so largely in bringing this Presbytery to
its present high state of efficiency are still
to be employed in advancing onr Pres
byterial work along all its varions lines.

Those Cree Indians.
Pioneer Press, 5th : The department
commander has given instructions to the
commanding officer at Fort Assinaboine£
Mont, to provide subsistence for ahont one
hundred and twenty destitute British Cree
Indians, who are refugees from the border
ing territory and have been inhabiting the
region around Dupuyer creek, Mont., for
three winters. They have been taken care
of by onr government through the cold
season and generally eke out a wretched
existence in the summer by hunting and
fishing.
Greenbacks Missing.
Washington, December 6. —Another ir
regularity has been discovered in the
Treasury Department arising from the
mysterious disappearance between the
receiving office and sealing division of ten
nncnt sheets of legal tenders, each con
taining four notes of the denomination of
$5 and representing $200 in all. While it
is possible the sheets were mislaid and
may be recovered, it is more than possible
that they were abstracted by some one
familiar with the method of handling
them. The notes will readily pass for
money. They lack only the Treasury
seal.
LEAP YEAR HOP.
The Second and Last Ball Given by
ths Ladies of Helena for the
Year 1888.
Conscious of the success of their last at
tempt and admonished by the approach of
the holidays that only a short time re
mained for them to exercise the preroga
tives of Leap Year, the ladies of Helena
put their fair heads together last week aud
decided upon giving a Leap Year ball to
their gentlemen friends. The year had
scarcely opened before the gallant dames
aud demoiselles honored the lords of crea
tion with a Leap Year hop, which proved
in every way a delightful affair. But
that has long since become a
pleasant memory and, as people
cannot always live on memories, the
same fair projectors of that noted event
conclnded to again compliment their meny
friends and make the closing month of
1888 as remarkable for social pleasures as
the opening had [been. Accordingly grand
preparations were made and last night was
fixed upon as the date for the last Leap
Year ball. It was given at Encore Hall,
which was ablaze with the loveliness of
exquisite toilets adorning fair forms and
pretty faces. The giddy boys for the nonce
played the roles of the sought instead of
the seeking and with becoming modesty
allowed their fair escorts to conduct them
to the ball room, coax them for dances and
wheedle them into an indulgence
in refreshments. Dancing was be
gan at nine o'clock and continued,
with a brief intermission for supper, until
an early hour this morning. The pro
pramme was good and the music,famished
by Prof. Yaeger's orchestra, exceptionally
fine. One and all merged themselves into
the enjoyment of the moment and the
hoars sped by on winged feet. Rarely has
there been each an enjoyable party in Hel
ena and to a looker on every one present
seemed to be having the best of good
times. The occasion will long be remem
bered with pleasure by all participants.

HOW THEY DO IT.
Gray Wolves Attacking a Herd of
Cattle.
A gentleman jnst in from the reserva
tion, says the River Press, reports seeing
several bands of large gray wolves, num
bering all the way from ten to twenty in
band, within the past week or ten days.
In one instance he witnessed a display of
cunning, or whatever it may be called, that
would seem to one unacquainted with the
tactics of these ravenons beasts to approach
human reasoning.
While riding along on an elevation of
ground overlooking a valley upon either
side he saw in the distance a band of cat
tle that seemed to he close herded, and
moving in a circumscribed circle. From
his point of observation he could see no
monnted men and, regarding the circum
stances as somewhat singular, he put spurs
to his horse and made for the band. The
mystery was soon explained. Circling
'round the frightened animals, each follow
ing close npon the heels of the other, were
fifteen or twenty large grey wolves, while
two of the largest and strongest were
within the circle making vigorous dashes
npon first one and then another of the im,
prisoned cattle with the evident purpose
of ham-stringing one of them. The ar
rival of the horseman put a stop to the
proceedings and the wolves scampered off
to a safe distance, where they stopped and
watched the movements of the intruder.
Placers at Bear Tooth.
(Montana Mining Review.}
John Steele, Jr., informed a Mining
Review reporter that he was jnst in from
Bear Tooth Mountain, where W. G. Akin
had discovered a placer deposit of wonder
ful richness. Mr. Akin made hia lucky
strike last week, and onr informant states
that he saw panned ont of twelve pans of
dirt $80 in gold, and that daring the past
seven days Mr. Akin has taken ont of his
claim abont $2,400. We nnderstand that
an offer of $23,000 cash has been refused
by Mr. Akin for his clain. Mr. Steele was
in the city after supplies, and returned to
the mines last Monday, and has promised
to furnish the Review with foil particulars
concerning the discovery. The Bear Tooth
is in plain sight of the city, and if the find
is as reported we predict a stampede in
that direction by old-time placer miners.

the meaning of the presence of railroad
surveyors in the vicinity of the Madison

completion of this road, which will be ac

a majority of the electoral vote of the
country will be cast against him, and that
Mr. Harrison will succeed him as the chief
executive of the nation, the other fact that
Mr. Cleveland received a majority of the
popular vote over his opponent sustains
him in his position that the cause of tariff
reform is the cause of the people. No one
will gainsay that proposition." The River
Press will probably hold that opinion until
the tabplated returns in next year's alma
nac shows that Harrison has abont a half
million majority of the popular vote.
— Pioneer Press : Hon. Martin Maginnis
came down from Montana yesterday and
took apartments at the Ryan. Mr. Ma
ginnis was elected delegate to congress
four times on the Democratic ticket, aud
is loath to concede that the Territory has a
Republican majority. A Repnblican dele
gate and Republican legislature were
chosen this year by about 5,000 majority
but Mr. Maginnis attributes this to a gen
eral dissatisfaction among the Democrats.
He thinks it probable that the Territory
will be made a State by the present con
gress. They have had a season of material
prosperity in Montana as far as the three
great pursuits of the Territory, mining,
stock raising and agriculture are con
cerned.

HOW I SUFFERED
Seventeen yenra from a Skin Disease,
(.on 1<I not w» k or «I reae myself. A
msNM of «lineane from heart to
f.Hit. «'overt lit ein lit week*
by the Cntienra Be inert le*.
At »he age of three months a rash (which after
wards proved to be eczema or salt rheum) made
its appearance on my face. A physician was
called. He said teething was the cause ; he pre
scribed some cooliDg medicine, but the sores
spr.ad to my ears and head. Another M. D.
was called. He profess d to know all about the
case, ca led it "King's Evil," and prescribed
gunpowder, brimstone, and lard mixed into a
salve; but the disease continued. The» could
not do anything with It. Another prescribed
borax, water, and flour; another, linseed poul
tices. None of them did me any good at all, but
made me worse. The disease continued un
abated; it spread to my arms and legs, t»ll I was
laid up entirely, and from continually sitting on
the floor on a pillow my limbs contracted so that
I lost all control of them, and was utterly help
less. My mother would have to lift me out and
into the bed. I could get around the house on
my hands and feet, but I could notget my clothes
on at all, ami had to wear a sort of dressing
gown. My hair had all matted down or fallen
off, and my head, face and ears were one scab,
and I had to have a towel on my head all the
time in the summer to keep the flies off. My
parents consulted a prominent physician ana
surgeon here In Chicago, (the other physicians
before mentioned were of Dundas and Hamilton,
Canada. > He said he could do nothing for me.
He wanted to cut the sinews of my legs, so that
I could walk: but I would not let him, for if I
did get better I would have no control of them.
The disease continued In this manner until I
was seventeen years old, and one day in Janu
ary, 1879 I read an account in the Tribune ot
your Ccticuka Remedies. It described my case
so exactly that I thought, as a last resort, to give
them a trial.
When I first applied them I was all nw and
bleeding, from scratching myself, hut I went
asleep almost immediately, something i had not
done for years, the effect was so soothing.
In at>out two weeks I could stand > traigbt, but
not walk, I was so weak, but my sores wero
near.y well. As near as I can judge the Cvri
ccra Remedies cured me 1n about six to eight
weeks, an 1 up to this date, (i. e. from January,
1879, to January, 1887,) I have not been sick in
any way, or have had the least signs of the dis
ease re ippearing on me.

No single disease has entailed more suffering
or hastened the breaking up of »he constitution
than Catarrh. The sense of smell, of taste, of
sight, of hearing, the human voice, the mind,—
one or more, and sometimes all, yield to its de
siructive influence. The poison it distributes
throughout the system attacks every vital force,
and breaks up the most robust of constitutions.
Ignored, because but little understood, by most
physicians, impotently assailed by quacks and
charlatans, those suffering from it have little
hope to be relieved of it this side of the grave.
It is time, then, that the popular treatment of
this terrible disease by remedies within the
reach of all passed into hands at once competent
and trustworthy. The new and hitherto untried
method adopted by Dr. Sanford in the prepara
tion of his Radical Cure lias won the hearty
approval of thousands. It Is instantaneous in
affording relief to all head colds, sneezÿig, snuf
fling and obstructed breathing, and râpidly re
moves the most oppressive symptoms, clearing
the head, sweetening the breath, restoring the
senses of smell, taste and heating, and neutra
lizing the constitutional tendency of the disease
towards the lungs, liver and kidneys.
Sanford's Radical Cure consists of one bot
tle of the Radical Cure, one box of Catarrhal
Solvent and Improned Inhaler; price, 81.
