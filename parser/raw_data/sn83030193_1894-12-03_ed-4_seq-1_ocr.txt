Ipv looked as If he was prepared for an In-

II the committee would undoubtedly Inquire
if I into the methods and practices of the
Kr"Jkk. police courts of the city before long, but
siSK tIsW.. o special programme had been arranged
fS tJ for this branch of the Inquiry.

BbW JUwUmc -KU-utolwa visitor present
slaMi
was John Burns, the English labor rep
resentative, who came In with President
Samuel Qompers, of the Federation
of Labor.
Mr. Burns wants to learn something of
how things are run In New York. He
had read a good deal about Lexow and
police protection, but he wanted to hear
something for hlmsMf, and In this way
get a better Idea of American Institu
tions. Ho told an "Evening World" reporter
that he thought New York a fine city
and admired Its big buildings. Benator
Cantor arrived Just before the Committee
was called to order at 11.30.
Mr. Burns was introduced to the Sen
ators by Mr. Oompers. They greeted
him very cordially and Invited him to a
seat upon the b'nch, which he accepted.
Mr. Je-ome. who has been so much en
gaged with the affairs of the LXX. that
he could not attend the hearings before
election, was in his old place again.
The conference of Mr. Ooft with Chair
man Lexow lasted until nearly noon.
Many guesses were hazarded as to the
cause of the delay, and Mr. Gort finally
said he was waiting tor an Important
witness whom he had expected to be
present.
Detective Kearney and another one of
the Committee's subpoena-servers were
hurriedly sent out of the court-room.
Letter front Andrews.
Then Chairman Lexow rapped for
order and. announced that he had re
ceived a letter from Street Cleaning
Commissioner W. 8. Andrews requesting
a copy of the testimony given at the last
sessions regarding his actions while In
the Excise Board. He had referred this
letter to Mr. Ooff.
Mr. doff stated that ho had been In
communication with Commissioner An
drews and had Informed him that while
he did not think It proper to furnish
him with a copy of the testimony taken,
he had offered to give him the first op
portunity this morning to present the
vindication he desired.
"I understand that Commissioner An
drews Is before the Board of Estimate
and Apportionment this morning and
cannot, attend, so I have extended the
Invitation till to-morrow."
Ansvrercd for Evelyn Dell.
Mr. doff then said he proposed to take
up somo unfinished business and cases
that had been left over from the last
session of the Committee.
He asked that the name of Evelyn
Bell be called. A woman In tho crowd
stood up.
"That's not Evelyn Boll." said Mr.
Ooff. "Call her again."
The call was repeated, but no response
was given, and at Air. Qoft's request the
counsel was Instructed to bring the case
of the Bell woman to the attention of
the Grand Jury.
"She has been summoned several
Samuel Gompers
times," said Mr. Ooff. "but has failed to
obey tho subpoena."
Hatcher Lerrls the First Witness.
The first witness called was Augus

who shook his head.
" Well, you can be sent to State

" I didn't think I was doing anything

falae and untrue. Yet his signature was
attached. He explained this by saying
that ho had never read the paper, and

Question.
WASHINGTON, .Dec. 3.-Upon Unas
sembling of Congress the President's
message was laid before the two liouses.
it Is a document of some 16,000 words.
In addition to his own suggestions to
Congress the President presents In brief
tho salient points of tho report of each
of his Secretaries bearing upon tho action
of their departments for the fiscal year.
To tbe Congress of the United States:
The assemblage within the nation's leg
islative halls of those charged with the
duty of making laws for the benefit of a
generous and free people Impressively
suggests the exacting obligation and In
exorable responsibility involved In their
tark. At the threshold of such labor
now to bo undertaken by the Congress
of the United States, and In the dis
charge, of an executive duty enjoined by
the Constitution, I submit this communi
cation, containing a brief statement of
the condition of our National affairs,
and recommending such legislation as
stems to me necessary and expedient
The history of our recent dealltigs with
other nations, and our peaceful relations
with them at this time, additionally dem
onstrate the advantage of consistently
adhering to a firm but Just foreign pol
icy, 'free-from envious or ambitious Na
tional schemes and characterized by en
tire honesty and sincerity.
During the past year, pursuant to a
law of Congress, commissioners wero
appointed to the Antwerp Industrial
Exposition. Though the participation
of American exhibitors felt far short of
completely Illustrating our National In
genuity and Industrial achievements, yet
It was quite creditable In view of the
brief time allowed for preparation.
I have endeavored tb Impress upon
the Belgian Government, the Heedless
ness and positive harmfulness of Its
restrictions upon the importation of cer
tain of our food products, and have
strongly urged that the rigid supervision
and Inspection under our laws are amply
sufficient to prevent the exportation
from this country of diseased cattle and
unwholesome meat.
A serious tension of relations having
arisen at the close of the war between
Braxll and Portugal, by reason of the
escape of the Insurgent Admiral da
Gama and his followers, the friendly
offices of our representatives to iose
countries were exerted for the proton
tlon of the subjects of either wltmv
the territory of the other.
Although the Government of Brazil
was duly notified that the commercial
arrangement existing between the
United States and that country, based
on the third section of the Tariff act
of 1S90, was abrogated on Aug. 28, 1891,
by the taking" effect of the Tariff law
now In force, that Government subse
quently notified us of Its Intention to
terminate such arrangement on the first
day of January, 1695, In the exercise of
the right reserved In the agreement
between the two countries. I Invite
attention to the correspondence between
the Secretary of State and the Brazilian
Minister on this subject
The Commission organized under the
convention which wo had entered Into
with Chile for the settlement of the
ioustandlng claims of each Government
against the other, adjourned at tho end
of the period stipulated for Its continu
ance, leaving undetermined a number
of American cases which had been duly
presented. These claims are not barred
and negotiations are tn progress for
their submission to a now tribunal,
THEATY WITH Clll.VV.
On the 17th of March last, a new
tioaty with China In further regulation
of emigration was signed at Washing
ton, and on Aug. 13, It received the
sanction of the Senate. Ratification on
the part of China and formal exchange
are awaited to give effect to this mu
tually beneficial convention.
A gratifying recognition of the uni
form Impartiality of this country
towards all foreign States was mani
fested by the coincident request of the
Chinese and Japanese Governments, that
the agents of the United States should,
within proper limits, afford protection
to the subjects of the oter during the
suspension of diplomatic relations due
to a state of war. This delicate office
was accepted, and a misapprehension
which gave rise tq the belief that In
affording this kindly unofTlo'al pieteotlon
our agents would exercse the same au
thority which the withdrawn agents of
the belligerents had exercised, was
promptly corrected. Although the war
between China and Japan endangers no
policy of the United States. It deserves
our gravest consideration, by reason of
Its disturbance of our growing commer
cial Interests In the two countries and
the Increased dangers which may re
sult to our citizens domiciled or so
journing In the Interior of China.

the Club's rounsel, John M. Bowers, who
presented an opinion thut morning, view
ing th- situation from every standpoint
If the Legislature should Interpret a
stake or a purso as a lottery, and adopt
measures punlthlng persons offering
stakes and purses, of course, no meeting

nothing tr- lolate the laws of the State.
The Coney Ialand Jockey Club Is the
foremost racing association In this coun

to Indicate that the racing (situation Is
not as baa us It might be.

preme Court this morning Senator M. C.
Butler's petition for an Injunction re
straining the State Treasurer from mak
ing payment of salaries to supervisors
of election registration was heard.
Attorneys for the Senator claim that
the Registration law Is unconstitutional,
and his supposed intention Is to have
the recent general election set aside
as Illegal and then vitiate the legality
of the Legislature now sitting and which
will elect Tillman, his successor.
Attorncy-Uenernl Buchanan for the
State took the position that Senator
Butler having heretofore acceded to the
constitutionality of the law and been a
beneficiary tinder It by his repeated elec

Bookmaker Fred Miller's Case to

(Speclsl t The Evening World )
RACB TRACK, ALEXANDER ISL
AND, Dec. X Clear weather attracted a
largo crowd to the Alexander Island
course to-day and eleven bookmakers
wero kept busy handling the money.
As Is the custom at this track the
scratches were few and fair betting was
obtainable against supposedly good
things as well aajpubllc favorites.
The case of Fred Miller, arrested for
making book at the Bennlngs track on
Saturday, will come up for a hearing
In the Police Court on next Wednesday.
This Is tbe first move In the attempt to
reopen the Bennlngs and Ivy City tracks.
The Judges began an Investlgstiotiithls
afternoon In the running of the horse
Fagln. Owner Frank Weir was called
Into th stand and closely questioned.
He exhibited tickets bet on the horse
whenever he started. A decision was
not given. He was, however, requested
to withdraw all his horses entered for
the day. .
The talent voted Imp. Bones a good
thing for the opening race, a dash or
four and a half furlongs, and he was
made a strong favorite. The plungers
backed him to a man. Misery was
also In strong demand, and a lot of
money was bet on him In the place
books. . ,
The favorite won easily. Bon Voyage
might have given the favorite a hard
race If he had got away well, but a
Koor send-off killed his chances, and
e only secured third place, after closing
a lot of ground. Free lress was Becond.
