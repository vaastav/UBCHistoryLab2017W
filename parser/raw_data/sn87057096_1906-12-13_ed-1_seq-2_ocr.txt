Judge Urosscup, of Chicago, calls
lioosevolt's message a crazy quilt.
I'or Imps the President thought that
Congress needed a Christmas gift.
"Leave the circle off! Leave it off!"
insists the Chelsea Independent. "(Jive
every man an easy chance to vote his
honest convictions and no harm will
be done.''
Would President Roosevelt consider
ed the tilling of a Mormon leader §200
upon the birth of the forty-fifth heir to
a man with five wives, in restraint of
the anti-suicide idea?
A writer in London Truth says that
in twenty years America will bo much
the greater nation on the Globe. In
twenty years'.' Which is much the
greatest nation on the globe now?
"Of what account would the circle on
the ballot have been this year?" asks
the Woodbine Chronicle. "To the
average voter in Harrison county it
would have looked like a deserted rat
hole."
'There is no use trying to lay the
blame for defective ballots at the last
election upon the removal of the circle,"
asserts the Mt. Vernon Record. The
simple truth is that a good many stand
patters did not know how to scratch
their ballot.
Senator Pettus, the oldest member
of congress, who was not well at the
close of last session was one of the first
to arrive on the opening day at the
capifcol. He sticks to his pet phrase
of telling his colleagues how "young"
he is when reference is made to his
advanced years.
"None of these questions, the tariff,
ship subsidies, harbor and labor im
provements, the suffrage, the question
of the control of corporate interests,
ought to be local questions," argues the
Deuison Review. "We must get away
from selfishness, from pettiness, from
provincialism and from prejudice if we
are to be good governors ot America."
The district court at Washington has
just decidjd in favor of the old soldier,
in a siinilir case to one that might
have materialized in Knoxville some
time ago. In the case at bar, the
Washington city council rejected the
petition of an old soldier who asked
that he be chosen street commissioner.
The court decided that he was in the
right, under the law. Knoxville Ex

A irroll county hog raiser has given
his neighbors an object lesson in the
art of making one dollar breed two.
Some time ago he paid over §000 for a
brood sow, and the neighborhood fore
saw immediate disaster. She raised a
litter of live pigs, two of which he has
sold for $2:i2.r»0 apiece, and has refused
$450 lor the remaining three. It is a
big rjfit on the original investment,
and one, let it be remembered, that
evervone could not have made.
The West Des Moines school district
employes a trained nurse whose busi
ness it is to visit certain specified
schools, examine the children as to
their health, report all eases of physi
cally subnormal children, look after the
sanitary condition of the school rooms
as to light, heating, cleanliness and
ventilation and to visit the homes of
children that are sick with the view of
determining the propriety of admitting
other children from such homes.
No man can jus ify an act of cruelty
to a dumb animal, no matter what the
it is
is ab
great
place,
creat-
circumstances are under which
committed. It is a thing that
horrent, to humanity and in the
heart of the world can find no
Humane treatment of all God's
nres, given for our service should be
accounted a privilege and he who can
not appreciate this sentiment is not
worthy of the consideration or respect
of manly men. The courts may well
treat with rigor those who maltreat
their horses. We should see altogether
'less brutality in this era of general
good feeling.
We are educating our young men for
idle gentlemen, trj
ing to make lawyers,
preachers, doctors and clerks out of
material that is needed for blacksmiths,
carpenters, merchants and other honest
"hewers of wood and drawers of water."
It- is a mistake and a big one to teach
boys and girls to believe that labor is
disgraceful and to do nothing for a
living is more becoming to society.
There are sons and daughters who are
now being educated to play the "lead
ing lady" and "walking gentleman" in
tho great drama of life who will light
out for the poor house OE the peniten
tiary before the curtain drops on the
last sad act of the play to which they
have been educated by their too
indulgent parents.
A tannory in Minneapolis has dem
onstrated ihat cattle hides, particularly
black Galloways, can be tanned as soft
as mink skin. They make elegant floor
rugs. The same tannery can make
calf skin transparent and give it all
the qualities of parchment.
The anti-pass law is likely to have an
effect on tho legislative session. The
flying trips home for over Sunday will
this year include a cash consideration
to be settled at the ticket window
which is calculated to discourage the
complete freedom of the travel hereto
fore existing, and incline members to
expedite business and get home for
good.
The secretary of agriculture places
the value of this year's farm products
at $0,701,000,000, an increase of
000,000 over last year, which surpassed
any previous year. Tho total is not
much less than 885 for each man,
woman and child in the country, and
the excess over last year is not far
from 80 per capita.
It cuts our feathers not a ^little to
learn that Connecticut beats Iowa in
the average yield of corn per acre.
That nutmeg state gives the highest
aveage of all the states, namely 12.7.
Iowa ought to beat Connecticut two to
one. The difference is in cultivation.
By paying more attention to seed and
cultivation Iowa fanners could double
their product. Why should they not
do it?
"All hail to the independent voter,"
exclaims tho Oxford .1 unction Mirror.
"He is here a'ld here to stay. He came
with a rush as an unexpected result of
the new ballot which omitted the circle
at the head of the ticket and proves
the oft-made assertion that when a man
takes time to think, as he must do
under the new system ho chooses the
best man rather than the party man,
especially in home and county oflices,
as tho results of the recent election
will show."

STOMACH'S IMPORTANCE
How to Strengthen It so That
Will Act as it Should.
It
To enjoy both health and happiness
it is absolutely necessary that the
stomach and digestive organs should be
strong enough to properly digest the
food. If they are weak and inactive,
the body will soon be in a state of semi
starvation.
Nothing equals Mi-o-na stomach tab
lets in giving strength and tone to the
whole digestive system. Use this rem
edy for a few days, and youjwill^ find
the appetite keen, the digestion good,
no nausea or distress after eating, no
sleeplessness, no nervousness and the
backaches and headaches that are the
direct results of a weakened stomach,
will soon be overcome.
Ask L. P. Van Werden to show you
the guarantee which he gives with
every 50 cent box of Mi-o-na. It is
the one remedy he has enough £faith in
to guarantee.
How He Came to Suicide
[Original.]
"Ry the bye, Talbot, that autocratic,
high stepping Miss Peaohblow that you
were thinking of marrying has opened
an art store. That girl ought to have
had fortune. She Is Just fitted to be
the head of a gentleman's house."
Walter Talbot, who was brushing his
hair before a mirror, struggling to get
the part straight and in a place to suit
him, turned and looked at his friend
inquiringly, lie admitted that Miss
Peachblow was an old ilaine of his, uud
had It not been for her poverty he
might have married her. It had not
been neevssary that he should be de
prived of his love on this account, for
he had Inherited some means and was
doing very well In his profession, lie
had gone so far as to become engaged
to her, but on thinking the matter over
had concluded that in this commercial
age there was nothing practical in
mating with a poor woman. So lu had
broken the engagement, lie had not
since met any one. rich or poor, whom
he had cared 1o marry and had remain
ed a bachelor.
"Where is her shop?" he asked, re
suming his toilet.
The location was given, and Talbot
thought that he would go into the store
and see how his old flame would look
behind the counter. It was several
years since he had seen her, and she
might feel embarrassed at meeting
him. As for Talbot, his equanimity
was not easily disturbed. The next
afternoon on returning from his office
he chose a different route from his
usual one and stopped at a shop which
bore sign "Maria Peachblow." See
ing his former fiancee engaged with a
customer, lie waited near the door.
Miss reachblow turned her eyes to
ward him. She did not start. She did
not blush. She simply cast her eyes
again upon a picture she was trying
to sell.
Talbot was sure she had recognized
him and was surprised that she gavo
no evidence of the fact. For the first
time in the presence of a woman ho
felt uncomfortable. If she persisted
in treating him as a stranger his visit
would not be a pleasant one. Ha
wished he had not come. It wouldn't
do for him to back out now, so he
leaned on a counter and sucked the
head of his walking stick nervously.
The customer, a lady, was in no hurry
to choose, and It was half an hour aft
er Talbot entered the shop before Miss
Peachblow made a sale, took the lady's
address and promised to send the pic
ture the next day. Then as the cus
tomer went out Miss Peachblow ad
vanced with that stereotyped look on
her face by which salespeople ask
without the trouble of speaking, "What
can 1 do for you?"
THE LEON REPORTER. THURSDAY. DECEMBER 13, 1906,
Talbot stood trying to smile, but a
forced smile, especially when one is
badly disgruntled, results In something
not unlike a grimace. Conscious of
this. Talbot flushed. The lady noticed
neither of these conditions. She sim
ply said:
"Will you look at some pictures?"
"Yes—no—thank you —if you have
anything that you think will please
me."
Miss Peachblow turned and led the
way to large portfolios in racks and,
opening them, said:
"Here are some fine engravings.
These are water colors I can especially
recommend. In this one you will find
some photographs of celebrated pic
tures."
Talbot took hold of one of the port
folios, and his hand trembled. This by
no means tended to restore his equa
nimity. He wanted to break through
the invisible mask, shield or whatever
it was that she held between tlieui
Had he come with any definite purpose
he could easily have stated it, but he
had not. He had broken his engage
ment through selfish motives, and for
the first time he began to realize how
selfish they were, lie had come to the
girl he had jilted with motives of idle
curiosity, and he began to feel that lie
had been a fool to step in where an
angel would have feared to tread.
If Miss Peachblow had shown any
relish in her revenge, the spell by which
Mr. Talbot was held at arm's length
would have been broken. She did npl
She treated him as she would have
treated any other customer.
"I think this will do." said Talbot
selecting a landscape, "and this," a
battle piece. "I'll hang them logeiher.
"The landscape is soothing, the battle
piece exciting. They will make a good
contrast. Will you have them framed?'
"Certainly frame them."
"I will show you some samples."
Never mind the samples. 1 wouk
prefer to leave the framing to your
taste."
"But the prices vary. We have
frames at prices from 20 cents to $5
a foot. I think you had better instruct
me in this."
"Put on a suitable frame, no matter
what the cost."
"Very well, I will do my best and
send them. Let me see. This is Mon
day. Will Thursday do?"
"Yes, Thursday. Any day."
Meanwhile Miss Peachblow was look
ing for an order book, and, finding one,
took up a pencil.
"Address, please."
"Walter B. Talbot, 120 Orchard ave
nue."
"T-a-1 or T-o-1?"
"T-a-1."
"B-o-t or b-u-t?"
"B-o-t.".
"Thank you very much."
"Send the bill with the goods."
The lady, with a slight bend of the
head, turned away to wait on another
customer who had (entered, and Talbot
departed.
Six months later Talbot shot himself
for love of Miss Peachblow.
