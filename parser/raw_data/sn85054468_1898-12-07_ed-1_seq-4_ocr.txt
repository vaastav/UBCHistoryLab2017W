-vvluch, we are sorry to observe, ., that .
of a jelly-fish stranded on a hummock
of greatness from which it cannot es
cape, while to occupy it threatens Indi
fdual annihilation
Washington and Lincoln excepted, no
man in the history of the United
States ever had the chance of William
JIcKhiley to carve for himself a niche
of true greatness In the endiTnng rock
of his country's annals. What has he
done with It? The recognized lead
er of his fellow -countrj men in an
adventure whose results all men know
must mark a new departure in the
whole schema of the nation's and the
world's economy and must com
pel America to expand from
the position of a big, fat,
but Inconsidered Chinese pni ince
to the proportions and Inlluence of a
vast and mighty empire should be a
man of mind and constructive genius.
At least he should have some concep
tion of the problem imposed upon the
nation by the events in connection with
which he has been the most conspicuous
figure and factor.
On would rjghtlj presume that with
all the secret historj of the war at his
fingers' ends; with all the esoteric
knowledge of foreign designs and at
tempted movements, and with a full
conception of the demands of the peo
ple, as vvell as of conditions and per
haps obstacles relating to those de
mands, the President would be the sin
gle man of the day who could adequate
ly point out the path of safety, of duty
and of glorious destiny to the nation.
It was the confident expectation that
President McKinley would do just that
thing, which kept the countrj- for weeks
in a state of almost excited Impatience
for his message to Congress. His
friends, and The Times among them,
confidently looked for a forceful and
scholarly paper on the subject of
American expansion thai would excite
the wonder and admiration of postenty
equally with Washington's Farewell
Address and the Emancipation Procla
mation of Abraham Lincoln. Especially
did we at least anticipate dear and
fearless utterances relating to thost
questions of American material inter
est and right, as to which the posi
tion of the Administration, if It can be
truthfully said to hold any, and the
nearly universal sentiment of the peo
ple, are antagonized by the Hessians,
Tories and corrupt monopolists, who,
for the past two years, have been the
blatant and unblushing allies of Spain
and every other influence inimical to
our honor and prosperity.
On the heels of our waiting what did
vv" gel? Sixteen newspaper columns
full of meaningless phrases: or, if any
meaning could be extracted from the
mass of erbiage, the message amount
ed to nothing better than a plea that
the writer might be left alone and not
bothered to form or express opinion",
but that Congress would undertake the
herculean task of all our national his
torj', and tackle it without suggestion,
much less help, from the Executive.
Iir. McKinley might exactly as well
have recited the multiplication table, or
related the decline and fall of Samp
son's Jlatanzasi mule, foi any useful
purpose his widely heralded fncjcllcal
is calculated to s-rT" nt this time of
patriotism has bean stand
ing silent, with hat In hand, jeirnlng
for the grand and vivifjing deliverance
of a Jiaster. It has simplj- been
drenched with dishwater.
Tilt Ariuj lniui.llIoii.
The few voluble persons who oppose,
territorial expansion refuse to be
lieve that the acquisition of the Philip
pines Is an accomplished fact. They
are preparing for a more vigorous cam
paign against it, centering their hopes
on the rejection of the treaty by the
Senate. The Reform Club, in New
York, a concern well used to fruitless
fighting, has contributed its secretary
to the cause, with the special purpose
of laboring with the senators who ari!
classed as doubtful on this Issue. Nat
urally, It objects to any enlarge
ment of the army and any Increase of
naval strength.
Aside from the necessity of a larger
army growing out of the addition to
our responsibilities,, the proposition ap
proved by the President Is not for an
t
excessive army. Considering the pop
ulation and wealth of the country and
our recent experience, an army of one
hundred thousand Is moderate. It is
true that .our situation Is peculiar and
that even with our new possessions It
is in our power to avoid many of the
provocations that European nations
are subject to; but we can never be
sure of peace. "We are bound to pro
tect our citizens in every land. We
have missionaries in China, Turkey
and elsewhere, and we have seen that
their citizenship does not always se
cure them against oppression. Forced
into war, we must find that the lack of
a proper army organization strong
enough to qualify us for the handling
of a large body of men is a serious han
dicap. The worst of the afllictlons
that were imposed on the soldiers In
the late war would have been avoid
ed If there had been a more liberal mil
itary policy. We were, in fact, a na
tion without an army, called upon to
take Instant action. "With the rush of
oIunteers to the field there were de
mands which nobody was competent
through experience to meet. If there
had been a regular army of sev enty-fl e
thousand men there would liac been
a military staff such as no civilian poli
tician in the War Department could
have brushed aside-
In the end the cost will not be much
greater than ue might find the cost of
a war which we could not escap", yet
for which we would not be prepared.
We ma safely dismiss the idea that
we shall relinquish the Philippines.
No campaign that can be organized by
the un-American minority can defeat
the demand of the neonle. Instead of
increasing, the opposition Is pretty cer-

increase in the regular army for the
early days of island administration is
obvious. The volunteers who are now

their discharge with the end of the

reorganization of the array and the in

need not wait for the completion of the
treat- and its ratification.
'I lac Optn Hour.
That the friendlj attitude of Gieat
Britain toward Ameilca had something
to do with the lefusal of the other
powers, to inteifeie in behalf of Spain
during the critical hours of the Philip
pines controversy nobody seriously
doubts. It was believed, from the ex
pressions of the London press and of
leading English statesmen, that any
attempt to prevent the acquisition of
the islands by this country would lead
to a distinct understanding between
England and America. Now we are told
that there was more than a mere guess
of English support. Mr. W. T. Stead Is
not alwas a trustworthy authurlty,
but in this instance there Is conobora
tivc evidence of the truth of his state
ments. After asserting that in his vis
Its to the -various European capitals he
did not find a single public man who
did not oppose the American demands,
he says that immediatelj after the
declaiatlon of war an American minis
ter was told of the displeasure of the
Doners and their purpose to interfere
j in the intere-'t of Spain. His reply put
a summarj stop to all talk of interven
tion. He asserted that he had author
ity to say that England would join with
this countrj" against all the world
Whether he had such authority or
not, no well-informed person, doubts
that England would have supported
America to any extent. This is known
especially- to our representatives
abroad and to the President and Sec
retarj of State. It Is known, too, that
in the Interests of friendship based,
though it is, on material benefits
England would demand for America
the same trade advantages and the
same protection to citizens that she Is
able to gain in Asia for herself. Yet
in the face of this there is not a word
in the President's message to assure
that friendly nation of our desire and
intention to allow her to share in the
trade of our new iiossessions on equal
terms with ourselves and with Spain.
The prediction has been allowed to go
unchallenged that we shall make an ef
fort to extend our Chinese wall of com
mercial exclusion around these islands,
allowing Spain alone to enjoy the samp
privileges we reserve for our
selves. With the timidity that
exasperated the American people be
fore he was forced Into the
war, the President refrains from the
expressions of gratitude toward Eng
land that her friendly attitude merited.
We can conceive of the humiliation of
our representatives abroad when it is
charged that we are too .selfish to re
spond to an initiative that has been
worth much to us and gives promise of
being of still greater value.
It was not expected or desired that
the President should advocate an An-gio-Ameiican
alliance, but only to rec
ognize the timely service of England
and to give some indication that it Is
not his purpose to support any at
tempt to shut out that nation from the
trade of the Philippines. That we are
cntirelj- willing to enjoj- the benefit of
an open door in China there Is no
reason to doubt. The President's rec
ommendation of a commission to re
port on the conditions there shows our
interest In the future of Asia. So far
we hae allowed England to struggle
against a' Ilussian policy of trade ex
clusion alone, but with an eje to our
own advantage in event of her success.
However, England is satisfied to wait
for the declaration of the President's
Island policy before assuming that a
Dingley tariff will be applied to the
Philippines. She is not disposed to
believe w can. exhibit the selfish dis
position such a tariff would mean, and
she knows that the doom of protection
was sounded with the acquisition of the
Spanish colonies. The freedom of trade
of all the world In the islands Is in
evitable, but there Is no assurance that
this will be recognized until the im
practicability of a prohibitory tariff
and also Its dangers have been demon
strated. Since, to the far-seeing eye.
the policy of exclusion would be too
costly. It will be unfortunate If we
show ourselv es Insenslh'e to the advan
tages of the friendship of England by
a useless attempt to effect the impossi
ble In a high tariff in the Islands. Their
development makes a liberal policy es
sential nnd we may as w ell appear un
selfish in its application.
Wo wish to inquire with n-mlcular earn
estness whether the President of the
United States Is the master or the crea
ture of the Secretary of War? It is as
serted that'the petitionsof 23.000 residents
of the District, asking for fie retention
of Captain Beach as Engineer Commis
sioner, and protesting against the reap
pointment of Colonel Black, although ad
dressed to Mr. McKlnlej , vv ere dlv erted to
and "mislaid" In the department presided
over by Black's friend and bicker, Mr.
Alger. It Is also understood that a large
number of currniunlcatious from promi
nent firms and Individuals, likewise dl
lecteil to the President, have met the
simo me. We have heard of the
"Prl-oner of the Vatican;" Is there a
"Prisoner of the White House?"
General Wheeler and Lieutenant Hobson
have hart reason to blush over the em
barrassing honor .s .ind klses the people
of the Northern States have bestowed
on them at even opportunity. Now they
have reason for another kind of blush
over the Insult the legislators of their
State offer to the Presldcnt.
lt tost the Government more than
elejitj-four thousand dollars to enforce
the Chinese exclusion laws during the
ear, and still there Is a suspicion that a
good man Celestials bribed their way
past the customs Inspectors at Malone, in
northern JJv York.
The Alabama legislature is doing what
it can to confirm tho charge that It Is the
South that seeks to keep alive the fires
of sectional hate that were supiosed to
have been extinguished by the late war
with Sptin. That It represents the senti
ments of a majority of the people of the
State is Incredible. Its action is peculiar
nnd exceptional and suggests a surrender
to the domination of a bad leader. The
refusal of the senate to adopt a resolu
tion inviting the President to Ilt the
general assemblj, from which the house
had stricken the preamble recognizing his
patriotism. Is Inconsistent with the resolu
tion to welcome Lieutenant Hobson and
buy a svv ord for General Wheeler. A legis
lature tint dellbcratelj affronts the Chief
Magistrate of the natlcn for no other cause
than that he Is the leader of the parti' to
which a majority of the .yabamu legisla
ture Is opposed, has no right to make a
pretense of patriotic regard for any hero of
the war. It Is not probable that the Presi
dent pines for a view- of the Alabirai
statesmen He can visit the District Zoo
any day and look at creatures that are
without the least respect for an American
President. A failure to iuvlte him would
not be regarded as a source of wo; but,

graceful to make it the opportunity to In

War Department for the papers In the

"The rillpinos believe they have been
engaged in a righteous war against
trannj and oppression and for the per
fect freedom of their country," said an
army officer last night. "The lone star

guiding star in their contest with Spain.
They received their inspiration to seek
freedom by force of arms from Cuba's
continued struggle, and now tliat the
Cubans have reached their goal through
the might of the United States, the Fili

of their freedom as a nation, of course,
under an American protectorate. Thcj

"The Filipino leaders will urge that they
were waging a successful inr for freedom
against the kingdom of Spain when we
commenced hostilities, and that the Cu
bans were insurgents in the full meaning
of the term as much as they (the Fili
pinos) were. These people are being
coached by shrewd Europeans, principally
Germans, and they may be Induced to re
sist American possession and sovereignty
In the Islands to the fighting point. At
any rate, this government does not pro
pose to be caught napping, as the en

GENERAL- "-POLITICAL GOSSIP
Speaker JThdmas B. Reed headed the
list of callers nt the White House es-terdaj-.
Some"persons thought that his
presence under the President's roof had
some special sfcnlflcance. They hailed It
as an Indication that Mr. McKinley and
Mr. Reed w'erj about to reach a better
understanding- and, at least, declare a
truce to hostilities during tho remainder
of the present session. But as a matter
of fact Mr. Reed's call was open to no
such construction. It Is customary for
the Speaker of the House to pay a formal
call at the White House at the beginning
of a session of Congress. A failure on his
part to do so would be. regarded as a
flagrant breach of official etiquette. Mr.
Reed's visit at the White House jester
day was merely an official formality. He
did not remain with tho President more
than three minutes by actual count and
their conversation was of a strlctlj- per-functorj-
character. The Speaker inquired
after the President's health and the
President expressed the hopa that the
Speaker irad enjojed good health sln'e
the adjournment of Congress. Each com
plimented tho other on his general ap
peal ance and after commenting on the
state of the weather Mr. Reed with
drew. Since Mr. McKinley has been President
Mr. Reed has made Just four official calls
at the "Ahite House. It is said thut lie
lias never been theru on a social or pei
sonal errand, and has never asked Mr.
McKinley to grant him a favor in patron
age or othervvlte. He did not, it is under
stood, ask permission to name the post
master or collector of tho port at his
home town of Portland. The position that
Mr. Reed took regarding these two ap
pointments was that the Administration
ought to show him the courtesy of re
questing him to Indicate his choice if he
hid an)-. The Administration did not
take this v,levv of the matter and two
men were appointed who were pcrsonally
objectlonable to Mr. Reed.
A careful poll of the Senate Is said to

that there was no longer any doubt about
the election of Chauncey M. Depew to suc

name would be the only one mentioned In
the Republican caucus. Mr. Depew wrould

significant, particularly as he doubtless re

The annual report of John W. Griggs,
the Attorney General, which was given
out jesterdaj-, is of peculiar Interest this
j ear because of the several legal matters
of Importance that have grown out of the
war with Spain. Among these are the ad
judication of cases under the war Internal
revenue law and the prize cases for Span
ish iiesscls captured and destrojed by the
American navy.
It is probable that the prize cases will
Le considered of most interest to the aver
age reader. The report gives for the first
time any statistics that are known to he
reliable and accurate, as to the value of
the ships captured and destrojed. The
Attorney General recites that a total of
flftj-slc vessels were brought Into various
ports and libeled as prizes during the
progress of the war. Of this number fifty
were taken to Key West,, within the Juris
diction of the Southern district of Flor
ida, four were taken to Charleston, one to
Savannah and one to New York.
All but eight of the cases brought in
the Southern district of Florida have been
heard and decided, those still undecided
being cases of capture during me later
stages of the. war.
The amount realized from the sale of
captured vessels and cargoes condemned
a? "prize" Is roi.054 IC In ten of the cases
the claimants have appealed to the Su
preme Court and the others are now pend
ing. Mr. Griggs comments on the novelty of
this clasa of cases "to the Judge and kiw
jers of this generation." and states that
the several district attornejs and mar
shals are especially deserving of com
mendation for their promptitude, ability
and success with the cas-. The work of
the district judges Is also mentioned by
him. He states that the have accorded
the Government and the claimants unu
sual privileges for expediting the hearings.
Mr. Griggs does not lane up me "
revenue ca-.es in detail in bis report, be
cause of the fact that they ate fully
dealt with in the report of the Com
missioner of Internal Revenue. He re
fers to them, however, with the sugges
tion that In several matters the Depart-mt-nt
of Justice has found defects in the
law, which ma), if Congress sees tit, tw
remedied by new legislation. He bi3
that the law- has been trMfclall m pro
ductive of doubtful question.
A short paragraph of the reiiort is de
voted to the recent fire in the rooms cf
the Supreme Court. M my valuab c rec
ords of the court were endangered Mr.
Griggs sas, and he advises that "an
adequate appropriation be made to fur
nish fireproof file cases In the otllcc cf
the clerk."
The Supreme Court in the court jear
of 1S37 disposed of STI cases. There were
docketed during the je.ir SK casES so
that the number on the docket was re
duced by TO. The number of cass re
maining undisposed of was 313. Ttere
has been a rapid reduction of the num
ber of cases on the Supreme Court deck
el during the hist seven jears tbe
number undisposed of in I'M having been
1.130.
There were 5 cases disposed of before
the court during the term in which the
United States was a party or had a sub
stantial interest. The United States was
appellant In . of the cases and appsllte
in 45. There were 7 certifications of ques
tions by the Circuit Court of Appeals
Of the cases appealed by the Government

10 were dismissed by It, 1 was dl-ml-sil

the Government was appellee, "a were
determined in its favor, G adverselj 2
were dismissed bj- the appel'ants. : were
reversed by stipulation and the remain
der were dismissed by the court.
There were three capital criminal
cases tried. Of these one was deeded
in favor of the United States, one ad
verser, and in one error was confessed
b the United States. '
Of the whole number of cases in which
the Government was interested, thlrtj
elght were decided in its favor and eight
een acainst it.
The Attornej- General brlellj reviews the
Important cases taken up by the Supreme
Court. Among them are the case- of the
United States agairst the North American
Commercial Company for large amounts
claimed by the Gov ernm-mt from the com-panj-
for rental and other charges for th
seal fisheries on the Pribilof Is.amls; the
case of the United States against the
Joint Traffic Association, and the Potomac
Flats cases, in which the decision of the
court has not yet been rendered.
In the paragraphs relating to the Court
of Clalrris, Mr. Griggs suggests that Con
gress enact such legislation as shall make;
Its Intention clear with regard to Indian
depredation claims, over 10,0X1 of which
are now awaiting decision on account of
difficulty or adjustment.
A full review of the Pacific Railroad
matters is made. The settlement of the
Union Pacific affairs bj- the pajment of
the Government's claim against the road
In full is described, and the pament of
the principal of the Kansas Pacific debt
and the steps that have been taken to se
cure the Government's Interest. The
present condition of the Central Pacific
matter under the law passed by Congress
last Jul is also described. The proceed
ings for tho foreclosure of the road have
been suspended by the Attorne General
under the law, and the commission ap
pointed by the law- are now. awaiting tbe
action of the company looking to a set
tlement of the indebtedness.
The attorney General recommends a
more complete and adequate form of gov
ernment for Alaska. He saj s that the ef
forts to administer justice and maintain
order in the territory with the -very limited
machlnerj- of the present laws his become
erj- dlfllcult and embtrrasclng with the
recent large Influx of population to the
gold fields.
He recommends a large Increase in the
number of judges, district attornejs and
commissioners, and an increase of the
power of the commissioners to enable
them to hear minor civil and criminal
cases. It Is also recommended that the
fee sjstem for ne pajment of the com
missioners be abolNhcd because of its ten
dency to make these officers- oppressive
and extortionate. The Attorney General
further recommends that the salaries of
the officers of the territory be increased,
owing to the cost of living in the territorv-
and the need of the best men for the posi
tions. The most Important part of the report
relating to Alaska Is tbe final recommen
dation that a limited legislative form of
government be established. It Is suggest
ed that a governor and legislative coun
cil be allow ed the terrltorj-, to be appoint
ed bj- the President, the council to have
power to pass laws subject to the ap
proval of the President
Mr. Griggs repeats the demands of his
predecessors for many years that the-De-partment
of Justice be given a new build
ing. He repeats the suggestions made by
Attorney Generals Garland, Miller, Olney.
and Harmon, and the report of the super
vising architect of the Treasury that the
present building Is unsafe, and adds to
this testimony his own decision that the
present structure is too-small for Its pur
pose, unsafe, overcrowded, and danger
ously overloaded. He recommends that a
building be erected to cover the whole of
the department lot. Including the space
occupied at present and tho lot to the
west of the present structure. He also
recommends that tho Court of Claims
be given other quarters.
The number of United States prisoners
in confinement on June 30 was 3,266, an
increase of 1S9 over the previous j'ear.
The Attorney General suggests in his
remarks on the District of Columbia
Jail that the Institution be made a peni
tentiary also, that District criminals of
the greater degree maj- be confined at the
Institution Instead of sending them to
State Institutions in various parts of the
countrj-.
The reports on the reform schools of
tho District are commendatory In every
waj It is recommended that the board
of trustees of tho boj-s reform school be
given such control of the bojs after they
are discharged as will enable It to re
claim and return to the school anj- boy
whose subsequent conduct Is bad
With regard to the girls' school the
recommendations of the board of trus
tees are all approved.
It Is suggested that the age limit for
admission or dismissal be reduced or left
to the discretion of the board. A salarj
of $000 annually for the treasurer of the
school Is recommended.
MEMORIAL BRIDGE PROJECT-
lleler-rntloit of Citizens Before a
Coiuniltf e of Coiurre-MN. .
The project of building a- memorial
bridgo across tho Potomac River from
the Naval Observatory' grounds to Arling
ton was brought up jesterday before the
House Committee on Interstate and For
eign Commerce by a committee of citi
zens of the District of Columbia and from
Alexandria County, Va.
The committee consisted of Representa
tive Rlxey. of Virginia: Frank Hume, R
Ross Perry, J. C. Clements, former Sen
ator Henderson of Missouri. A. B. Gra
ham and J. F. Drain. For two hours the
subject was discussed by these gentle
men for the edification of the committee,
and met with a favorable reception from
all except Representative Mann of Illi
nois, who thought that the rights of the
Government were not sufficiently Insured.
Long ago the chief objection was from
the War Department, which protested
against permitting a rallwa to cross any
portion of the reclaimed area of the Po
tomac wi.hout strict provisions as to the
width of Its right of way. SIrce 1SW.
however, the original project was so al
tered as to meet the demands of the War
Department, and several Secretaries have
warmly recommended it. Pealtars the
most conclusive and illustrative statement
on the subject is found in the report of
the Secretary of War for 1S9J, which saj.s:
"Improved means of communication be
tween Washlrgton and th Virginia shore
must very soon be provided Another
bridge Is not onlj a conceded necessltj- to
the population of both sides of the Po
tomac and as an approach to the national
cemetery at Arlington but also as a mll-ltarj-
convenience to bring the principal
garrison of the National Capital within
easy reach of its streets and public build
ings. "Twice I have submitted the suggestion
that such structure can easily be made
thf most Impressive of the world's me
morials to heroism. The natural advan
tages of the site are unsurpassed. The re
gion is associated with war as no other
part of our countr. and the site is" dis
tinctly national. Such a memorial bridge
ornamented with statues of our greatest
v-arriors. with symbolical figures of the
strong quaUtip that warfare brings Into
plaj, and with representations of the
crucial events In national historj, would
be the snme imcomparable memorial to
the greatness of a peaceful people aroused
by war as our stasie shaft to Washing-
..... . ...o u.w..csi iuuiiuuieiu iu mm-
vidual greatness which human genius has
et executed It is not proposed that the
embellishment of the bridge shall now
be provided for, but It is urged th.it Its
ultimate memorial character sliall be con
sidered In the first designs and earliest
appropriations."-
The promoters of the project urge that
when the bridge is built the privilege of
running street cars over It can be sold
to various companies at rates that will
really pay Tor the bridge. Congress, how
ever, has hitherto refused to accept this
Idea and has declined either to build the
bridge itself or to allow anj private cor
poration to do so
At the meeting this mornmg J C.
Clements, former commonw ealth's attornej-
for Alexandria County, submitted a
paper which he asked the committee to
adopt as its report to Congress. The gist
of this is contained In the following
paragraphr
"We are satisfied, however, that, con
sidering the necessity- of rendering speed
ily and safety accessible to the capital
its chief military- post at Fort Mjcr, the
propriety of a fitting approach to the
great National Cemetery at Arlington,
where are gathered so many or the ra
tion's, honored, dead, nnd th& desirability
for these reasons of subjecting the tis"e
of this bridge to tho control of the War
Department, none other than the Gov
ernment should be allowed to build it
For the simc reason, and because tram
wavs of every kind are excluded by this
bill from the use of this bridge," it is
proper th it the cost of building it should
be borne exclusiv elj- by the government."
The committee took the matter under
adv isement.
