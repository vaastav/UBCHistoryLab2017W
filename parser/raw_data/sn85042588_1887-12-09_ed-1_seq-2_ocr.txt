NOT FAVOBAKLY IMPBESSKD.
NBW YOKK, Dec. 7.—The Tribune of to­
morrow will contain along interview with
Hon. James G. Blaine on the president's
message. It was taken in short
hand under the direction of
the Tribune's Paris correspondent
and sent by cable to-night. It is as follows:
"I have been reading an abstract of the
president's message and hare been espec­
ially interested in the comments of the
London papers. Those papers all assume
to declare that the message is a free trade
manifest and evidently are anticipating an
enlarged market for English fabrics in the
United States as a consequence of the pres­
ident's recommendations. Perhaps that
fact stamped the character of the message
more clearly than any words of mine caft."
"You don't mean actual free trade without
duty?" queried the reporter. "No, no,"
replied Mr. Blaine, "nor do the .London pa­
pers recommend what in the United
States is known as revenue tariff rejecting
the protective feature as an object
and not even permitting protection to
result freely a« an incident to
revenue duties." "I don't know that I
quite comprehend that last point," said the
reporter. "I mean," said Mr. Blaine, "that
for the first time in the history of the
United States the president recommends
retaining the internal tax in order that the
tariff may be forced down even
BELOW THE FAIE BE
VENUE STANDABD.
He recommends that the tax on tobacco be
retained and thus that many millions an­
nually shall be levied on a domestic pro­
duct which would far better come from a
tariff on foreign fabrics." "Then do you
mean to imply that you would favor the
repeal of the tobacco tax?" '-Certainly I
mean just that," said Mr. Blaine. "I
should urge that it be done at once, even
before the Christmas holidays. It would
in the first place bring great relief to
growers of tobacco ah over the country
and would moreover materially lessen the.
price of the article to the consumer. To­
bacco to millions of men is a necessity.
The president calls it a luxury, but it is a
luxury in no other sense than tea and cof­
fee are luxuries. It is well to remember
that the luxury of yesterday becomes a
necessity of to-day. Watch, if you please,
the number of meu at work on the farm, in
the coal mine, along the railroad, fh the
iron foundry or in any calling and you will
find 95 to 100 chewing while at work. Af­
ter each meal the same proportion seek
the solace of a pipe or a cigar. These men
not only pay the millions of the tobacco
tax, but pay on every plug and every cigar
an enhanced price which the tax enables
the manufacturer and retailer to impose.
The only excuse for such a tax id the
actual necessity under which the govern­
ment found itself during the war
and the years immediately following. To
return the tax now in order to destroy the
protection which would incidentally follow
from raising the same amount of money
on foreign imports is certainly
A MOST EXTKAOBD1NARY POLICY
tor our government." "Well, then, Mr.
Blaine, would you advise a repeal of
whisky tax also?" "No, I would not.
Other considerations than those of the
financial administration are to be taken in­
to account with regard to whisky. There
is amoral side to it. To cheapen the price
ot whisky is to increase the consumption
enormously. There would be no sense in
urging the reform wrought by high license
in many states if the national government
neutralized the good effect by making
whisky within the reach of every one at
20 cents a gallon. Whisky has done a
vast amount of harm in the United States.
I would try to make it do some
good. I would use the tax
to fortify our cities on the seaboard."
"But," said the reporter, "you don't think
we are to have war?" "Certainly not
neither do I presume did Mr. Tilden when
he wrote his remarkable letter, but we
should not imagine it an absolute impossi­
bility." "But after the fortification should
be constructed would you still maintain
the tax on whiskv." "Yes so lone as there
is wnisky to tax I would tax it and when
the national government should have no
use for the money I would divide the tax
among the federal union with the specific
object of lightening the tax on real estate.
The tax on whisky by the federal govern­
ment with its suppression of illegitimate
distilling and consequent enhancement of
price has been a powerful factor in the
temperance reform. 1 should also seri­
ously object to the repeal of the duty on
wooL To repeal that would work great
injustice to many interests and would
seriously discourage what we should earn­
estly encourage, namely, the sheep culture
among farmers throughout the union."
"Do you think if the president's recom­
mendation were adopted it would increase
our export trade "Possibly in some few
articles of peculiar construction it might,
but it would increase our import trade ten
fold as much in the great stanle fabrics of
woolen and cotton goods, in iron, in steel,
in all the thousand and one shapes in
which they are wrought" "Then
think

underlies the whole subject?" "Of course
it does. It is in fact the entire question,

s&jy&i workers, masons and mechanics in every
-department to work as cheaply and live as
poorly i*i the United States as similar work
men in Europe, we can of course manufac­

andFrance." "Yea, but might not the
giwrt farming class be benefited bylm

baying at higher prices at home?"

the French Republic.

faction.
VEBSAILLES, Dec. 8.—M. Sadi-Carnot
was elected president of the republic at the
congress of senators and deputies to-day.
He received 600 votes, M. de Freycinet and
other candidates withdrawing. The pres­
ident belongs to a family that has figured
prominently in French politics for nearly
a ceutury. He was up to his election a
member of the senate and has held port­
folios in at least six cabinets under the
third republic. His election is evidently
the result of a compromise between the
Ferryists and the union left, whose favor­
ite candidate was Freycinet. The ballot
upon which Sadi-Carnot was elected stood:
Sadi-Carnot, 616 General Saussier, 186
M. Ferry, 11 M. de Freycinet, 5 General
Appert, 5, and M. Pyat, 1. Great anima­
tion is shown upon the boulevards, but
there is no disorder. It is apparent that
the result of the election gives general
satisfaction.
BEMAltKS BY THE PBESIDENT.
PARIS, Dec. 8.—In acknowledging the
congratulations of the deputies upon his
election M. Sadi-Carnot said: "I am filled
with gratitude to the members of the as­
sembly who in uniting their suffrages in
my favor, bear witness of a desire for
peace in concord with which the republic
of France is animated. My dearest wish is
that this great day may remain present in
all minds and hearts. It signifies that the
representatives ot France can be united
then. Common efforts can and must secure
a constitution assuring an active and stable
working government, capable of bestowing
upon the nation liberty at home and dig­
nity aOroad, with all the benefits which
our country expects from the republic."

PABIS, Dec. 4.—1 a. m.—M. Sadi-Carnot
drove directly from Versailles to the
Elyseetotake formal possession of the
palace. He soon retired to his own resi­
dence, No. 25 Rue d'Assines. The in­
habitants of that quarter speedily assem­
bled and greeted the president
with enthusiastic shouts of "Vive
Sadi:Cornot" and "Vive Le Navarra.
president." Sadi-Carnot appeared at a
window and said: "I give you hearty thanks,
citizens, for this evidence of your sym­
pathy. I beg you to prove by your calm
demeanor and regard for order that you
are in truth worthy to have a republican
government." The speech was hailed with
shouts of "vive la republique." The peo­
ple aispersed quietly. Many houses and
ships were illuminated and decorated with
the tri-color to-night. The streets at this
hour is rapidly emptying.
THE FEELING IN GEBMANY.
BERLIN, Dec. 8.—The election of M. Sadi-
Carnot is better received in official circles
than would have been that of de Freycinet
or M. Ferry. The new president is con­
sidered to be a feeble man and who would
be unwilling to consent to complications
which might bring about a European war.
It is also believed that he will be unable to
make alliances against Germany. His
personal preferences are for a neutral or
pacific policy and he will try to govern
through a ministry with the same tendency.
Sad News.
Many Bismarckers knew Lieutenant
Harrington, the dashing young officer who
was killed in the Custer massacre. He was
stationed at Fort Lincoln and was a fre­
quent visitor to Bismarck before the ill
fated expedition. It was he who escaped
from the battle field during the slaughter
and was followed for seven miles by In
diaus. His horse had nearly exhausted
all of the Indians' ponies, and the savages
were about to give up the chase when Harr­
ington, recognizing the fact that ais own
horse was nearly exhausted ard determin­
ed not to fall into the clutches of the savages
white alive, drew his revolver and killed
himself. Knowing as they did, the gallant
young officer, the following from the New
York Herald will give a pang to many
Bismarckers:
Joy, though it was tinctured with sadness,
filled a quiet household at Highland Falls
yesterday with a strangely brightened at­
mosphere such as it had not known iu
many weary months. The parents, sister
and brothers of Mrs. Grace Harrington,
the widow of the young lieutenant" who
fell in the Custer massacre, knew at last
that she had been found and that, after so
long a period of demented wandering, dur­
ing which they had been doubtful whether
she was alive or dead, she had returned to
the kind refuge which she had left and
was lovingly watched and cared for once
more. But the poor, stricken wanderer
had not yet fully recovered her reason, and
she was physically almost a hopeless
wreck. And thus a dark cloud etill rests
upon the anxious hearts who love her, and
this may further be deepened at any time
by her death, or, on the other hand, mouths
and even vears may elapse before it can be
wholly removed.

SECRETARY FAIRCHILD'8 REPORT.
A NEW THEOBY.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—Secretary "of the
Treasury Fairchild begins his. annual re­
port transmitted to congress to-day by call­
ing attention to the immediate urgency of
taxation reform as affecting the surplus
revenues of the government. A careful
estimate shows that on January 1,1889, the
surplus will be $140,000,000 under the oper­
ation of the present tax and appropriation
law. One method proposed of reducing
the revenue is to compel a decrease of im­
portation and consequently a decrease of
revenue fromcustoms by largely increas­
ing the rates of duties. Another way is to
reduce or abolish internal revenue taxa­
tion. But the secretary thinks it is not
well to abolish or reduce internal revenue
taxation. It is a tax against whisky, beer
and tobacco. This tax is the least burden­
some and the least unjust of all the taxes
which the government levies upon the
people. The revenue from customs taxa­
tion is where the reduction should be
made. Add to the free list as many arti­
cles as possible. After the question of the
annual surplus of revenues is disposed of,
there still remains the surplus money
which is in the treasury to be considered.
A conspicuous example of
THE INEQUALITIES OF THE TABIFF
is found in the discrimination in the rates
of duty imposed upon woolen and worsted
cloths. The expense of this and other
revenue from customs during the last fisbal
year was 86,880,296. The total value of the
imports and exports of the last fiscal year
When compared with that of the fiscal year
of 1886, shows an increase of $98,542,013.
Our foreign commerce carried in vessels of
the United States, measured by its value,
has steadily declined from 75 per cent in
1856 to less than 14 per cent in 1887. Even
of this small percentage less than one-half
was carried in steam vessels berring our
own flag. An interesting fact is the de­
crease in the number of standard silver
dollars and an increase of the use of the
same money by the people in the form of
silver certificates. It is evident that the
future use of the silver dollar will be al­
most exclusively in the certificate form. It
is a waste to coin to store any more silver
dollars at present. There should always
be in the treasury enough silver beside that
held against outstanding certificates
to enable the government to at once supply
any demand for it on the part of the people,
but all held in the treasury in excess of
that amount is a menace tothesilver which
the people hold and also to United States
notes and national bank notes and to the
whole circulating medium except gold. It
would be an act of wisdom to prevent any
accumulation of silver in tlie treasury
beyond a sufficient reserve needed to meet
apy demand. This can be done by fixing
the amount of such reserve and providing
that when it is exceeded by say $5,000,000
the purchase of bullion shall cease until
the amount held by the government again
equals such reserve.
ANOTHER FLAN
would be to provide that when the reserve
exceeded an amount of United States notes
equal in value, such excess should be can­
celled if enough of them were in the
treasury, but if not there the purchase of
bullion to cease until the maximum reserve
should be reached. During the year ending
October 81, 1887, there have been 225 new
banks organized—capital $80,546,000 circu­
lation $4,690,875. Thirty-three banks have
been closed during the same period, of
which twenty-five have gone into voluntary
liquidation and eight have failed. The
total number of national bank-t organized
to date has been 8,805. The receipts under
internal revenue laws for the fiscal years
ended June 80, 1886 and 1887, respectively
were $116,902,869.44 and $118,887,801.06.
THE TREASURY SECRET SERVICE.
FACTS ABOUT COUNTEBFKITING.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The annual re­
port of the chief of the secret service di­
vision of the treasury was made public
to-day. It shows that there were 855 per­
sons arrested by the officers of the service
during the past fiscal year for violating the
laws against counterfeiting, etc. Of this
number seventy were convicted and sen­
tenced to imprisonment. The report says
that the counterfeiting now being done is
principally the work of Italians, who oper­
ate in bands in the different portions of
the country. The counterfeiting during
the past year amounted practically to noth­
ing. The report refers to the faet that all
but two of the many skilled operators ar­
rested since the war on counterfeiting
United States bonds are at liberty and
says they may be expected to resume their
nefarious operations at any time. The re­
port attributes the scarcity of counterfeit
paper money to the excellence of the work
done at the bureau of engraving and print­
ing and to the almost certaiu detectiouaud
punishment of the offenders.
THE STANDING COMMITTEES.
PBOBABLE APPOINTMENTS.
The committee designated in a republi­
can caucus to agree upon the reorganiza­
tion of a majority of the standing commit­
tees of the senate went into session imme­
diately on the adjournment of the senate,
and it is expected they will complete their
work to-day, but will not report or make
public their agreement until their work
has been submitted to the democrats. It
is generally believed that Mr. Sawyer will
be chairman of the co uittee on
postoffices
and post roads Wilson of Iowa chairman
of pensions Mr. Frye, on commerce Mr.
Hiscock, on rules Mr. Sibin. on railroads
Mr. Stanford, on public buildings and
grounds. The chairmanship of the com­
mitter on territories lies between Mr.
Mitchell of Oregon and Mr. Piatt. The
latter at present is chairman of the com­
mittee on patents. It is stated that the
chairmanship of the ways and means com­
mittee of the house has been tendered to
Mr. Scott of Pennsylvania.

He has done this on the 4ve of national

men of influence in the party havebfeen

nothing in this issue thus presented by
which Mr. Cleveland conld hope to draw
from the republican party any votes. Nor
this alone, for ir the protectionist faction
in the democratic party o-trry out their
own desires, or do what they have contin
uallv declared they would do, Mr. Cleve­
land lias done the one thing by which he
could imperil the prospection of his own
^nomination. It places Mr. Cleveland
"einy above those leaders to whom the re­
publican party has of late lent a hearing
and above most of the leaders of his own
party."
The Sun says: "It is not acommonplace
document, for it is simple, intelll
gible and coherent, and the quality
of brevity is chiefly due to the fact that ail
other topics of national interest are dis­
missed in a lump or postponed as of incon­
sequence in the presence of the one prob­
lem of supreme importance—the question
of tarriff revision. Mr. Cleveland has
never before in public paper taken sides
squarely upon this question."
The World says: "The admirable mes­
sage of the president has given to the dem­
ocratic party what it has ng lacked: an
issue and a leader. The issue is tax re­
form the leader is the president. It can
hardly be that the president has not had at
this juncture influence enough to secure
the union of the democrats in the house
upon a measure of revenue reduction and
tariff reform."

able, conservative and statesmanlike docu
ment which, unlike many other messages,

The Daily News says: "Seldom has an
American president had a more important
or impressive lesson to teach. The fact is
that, although President Cleveland makes
a pretense of shutting his eyes to it, the
policy of protection has been reduced to a
practical and theoretical absurdity. The
stone set rolling will not stop until the
JProtection is broken into pieces."
The Telegraph asks: "Is be sure that it
is to the wool tariff alone that the argu­
ment applies? Is he certain that there are
not large numbers—not perhaps in the
farming but in the wage-earning classes—
in America who lose more by the enhanced
prices of the necessaries of life than they
gain from an increase in wages by the pro­
tection of the industries in which thev are
employed."
The Times says: "No message on record
is more remarkable for a bold, outspoken
disclosure of a novel policv hitherto dis­
cussed or ignored by both' parties. It is
still more remarkable that Mr. Cleveland
has the courage to confront the solid phal­
anx or protectionists on the eve of a con­
test for the presidency."
The Chronicle says: "It has been many
years since such an important and sug­
gestive message has been sent to con­

FIGURING ON THE CONVENTION.
MINNEAPOLIS CHANCES.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The members of
the Minneapolis delegation who are here
for the purpose of securing the next na­
tional republican convention for Minneap­
olis have taken off their cOats and gone to
work in dead interest. They claim that
thev are bound to succeed and no other city
can present half the attractions to the na­
tional cemmittee which they can. Of all
the membeis of the committee who have
been seen a majority have been in favor of
Minneapolis and those who were not for
her as first choice werp for her next.
Members of the delegation say St. Louis,
Cincinnati, New York. Philadelphia and
Washington are out ot the race and that
Chicago and Omaha are the only places
they fear at all. The former place are do­
ing very little work, but with Omaha it is
different. Her delegation is working hard
and as they have plenty ..f money back of
tbeni, they are making some impression.
The Washington Post this morning said:
"It is the general opinion of the shrewd
men who crowded the hotel lobbies last
night that it would be practically useless
for the republican convention to go to the
extreme northwest and adopt a Jiigh tariff
platform, iu view of the enormous repub­
lican dissatisfaction which has been lately
going on in that section, looking in the
direction of free trade."

The Tribune says: «For the first time in
the country's history the president's annual
message omits all reference to many grave
public interests respecting which good cit­
izens of all parties agree and is exclusively
devoted to the issi\e between the parties.
President Cleveland gives congress no in­
formation about the fishery question, the
pending negotiations with Great Britain or
our relations with other foreign powers.
The nearest approach to this strange per­
formance in the aunual messages of previ­
ous presidents was when Mr. Buchanan
devoted most of a message to a defense of
his policy in Kansas. President Cleveland
seeuis refreshingly unaware that his entire
message is inspired by extreme free trade
theories. The president's gravest error is
the unfounded assumption that a needful
reduction of revenue can best be attained
by lowering the duties and thus inviting
larger-importations. It is a message which
his political friends will keely regret and
which they will labor to explain away
when they come to confront the voters
next fall."
FOBEIGN COMMENT.
LONDON, Dec. 7.—The Morning Post,
commenting on President Cleveland's
message, says: "The message will produce
a profound sensation in Europe as well as
in America, and will strengthen the free

those countries, and'among thtbse by
whom a chaperon is recognized as asocial
necessity, no chaperons in any Christian
country have so severe a task as those of
Spain. From early childhood iuitil young
womanhood the Spanish girl is generally im­
mured within convent walls, presumably for
her education, although what she learns dur­
ing those long years, except the rudiments of
reading and writing, how to sew and em­
broider a little, to use a fan to perfection, to
wear her garments with a bewitching grace,
and to use her eyes to the destruction of the
repose of all male beholders, it would be diffi­
cult to say. Once out of the convent and of
marriageable age—say 14 or 15—die is placed
in the charge of a duenna, who from tii«*
moment never loses sight of her in daytime
and sleeps in the same room at night Such
a thing as a moment's privacy the girl
neither expects nor obtains. If the gouvern
ante absents herself, the young lady is first
taken to her mother. If she goes out to
church, to the opera, or for a walk, she is
closely guarded on the street, or the paseo,
she is sent a step or two in advance, the
mother or duenna, or often both, following
so that they can see her every motion, and
that no daring lover slips a" billet douxinto
her not unwilling hand. The consequence is
that, feeling perfectly safe and entirely irre­
sponsible, she is the most arrant flirt in the
universe.
In France, Germany, Austria and through
Central Europe the duties of a chaperon are
much alike, and are far lighter than they
were even five-and-twenty years ago.
Throughout Europe no young girl, or to put
it more plainly, no unmarried woman, can
appear in public unescorted by some matron.
As for a male escort, that is, of course, far
worse than being alone. Even a brother can­
not take his sister to a theatre or place of
public resort without a chaperon. In France
it is indeed the custom to keep the brothers
rigidly apart from the sisters after their 8th
year, except when in the company of the pa­
rents, because the whole educational scheme
is so different for the two sexes. Often later
in life and after the sister is married they be­
come close friends, but no girl would be al­
lowed to go into the streets or public places
with her brother some one might not know
that it was a brother, and there would be a
scandal. To balls and parties the girl can
only go with her mother or some chaperon,
who for the time represents her. No sooner,
however, is the young French girl made a
wife—perhaps to some man she hardly knows
by sight—than all this is changed it is like
the lowly grub suddenly bursting into the
most gaudy of butterflies.
In Germany and Austria the rules, al­
though strict, are not so rigid as in France,
the young ladies, both at Home and in the
ball room, being allowed a little more liber­
ty, especially where the Protestant element
predominates, in this differing widely from
France, where the Protestants are notoriously
more rigid and Puritanical than their Catho­
lic fellow countrymen, denying to youth even
such innocent pleasures as dancing and other
harmless amusements.
Belgium, at least so far as its capital city is
concerned, follows French customs, and
much the same may be said of St. Peters­
burg. In Holland, while the court etiquette
is the strictest in Europe, the girls are al­
lowed in their home life almost as much free­
dom as are English girls. Italy, but a few
years ago the most formal country in mat
I ters social, is breaking down her barriers.
The immense number of English and Ameri­
can girls constantly on the continent, and
who insist upon carrying with them the free­
dom of action that they look upon as their
birthright, the wealth, beauty and. accom­
plishments of many of them giving access to
the best society and compelling the admira­
tion of all, has done vastly much toward free­
ing their continental sisters.
In England the duties of a chaperon are
much the same as in the larger American
cities. To go to a ballr party, flower show,
theatre or other place of public amusement a
girl must have a chaperon of some sort who
sees her from her home and returns her to it.
At a ball the advantage ot. the chaperon to
the girl is enormous, especially if the lady be
a woman of the world. If a bore comes along
the chaperon claims his attention if the girl
cannot say she is engaged for the particular
dance the bore has asked for, the chaperon,
at a look, says: "You must rest this dance,
dear you must not over fatigue yourself, I
insist come and sit here by me." It is the
same when the girl wishes to escape from an
ineligible, especially if she thinks some one
else is looking for her "I must go back to
mamma, now (or to. Mrs. Blank, as the case
maybe). I promised to come directly the
dance was over."
The only continental country that permits
almost American or English freedom to its
girls is Switzerland. Even in the French
portion—Geneva and its neighborhood—the
girls walk unattended through the streets,
and at the most fashionable female boarding
school parties are given twice a month to
which the college students and other young
men of fashion are invited.—E. J. Biddle in
Globe-Democrat.
Boxing the Ears.
There ought to be a statute in every state
severely punishing this practive or rather an
infliction of blows on the head, so common-in
families and schools of inferior grade. A
recent investigation of medical records re­
veals fifty-one cases of serious injury to chil­
dren from "boxing" or "cuffing" on the ear
in some cases chronic and ultimately result­
ing in fatal brain disease, deafness, insanity,
etc. It would be impossible to discipline all
offenders, but much might be done by special
care in giving notice of the law and penalty
through the newspapers and by circulars dis­
tributed by board Of health inspectors, and
by instructions to the police promptly to ar­
rest parents or others seen cuffing children
as they may be seen at all hours of the day
certain regions of every city.—Sanitary
Paint for Kitchen Walls.
Paint is found better than calcimine or
whitewash upon the walls of a kitchen, since
the steam from the washing and cooking has
lees effect upon it, and also because it can be
more readily cleaned. Before painting the
wall needs to be washed with soapsuds, then
covered with a coat of dissolved gluo, which
must be allowed to dry thoroughly before
the paint is applied, the work being done
well and quickly with broad, flat brush.—

To Treat an Ingrowing Nail.
A painless method ot treating an ingrow­
ing nail is to draw a woolen yurn under the
eoraer ot the nail, leaving both cuds project*
Ing, and let it remain thus until the nail ha*
grown free from the flesh. A little mutton
tallow may be used to soften the flesh about
tba nail, and in trimming the nail allow the
«ersto project a little boyoud the flash.
