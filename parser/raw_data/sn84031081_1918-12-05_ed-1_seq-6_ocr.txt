There litis been an increase in tlic
number of flu cases reported, but
there Is no reason yet to believe that
that flare-up is due to lifting the
quarantine. That may be shown
later.
The Journal wants to again empha
size the necessity for vaccination as
u preventive.
While sufficient data has not been
tubulated for accurate Judgment, suf
fice it to say that only u very small
percentage of those vaccinated take
flu, and those who do take it have
it in light form, as a rule.
But the most Important vaccination,
beyond doubt, is that against pneu
monia. Pneumonia, year In and year out,
is the most fatal disease known to the
American people. Dr. Evans of Chi
; cago, than whom there is probably no
better authority, says that not more
than one person In two hundred dies
from the flu, when pneumonia does
not set in. , -
But more than twenty-five persons
in rv'i-y hundred die. when pneumonia
develops.
More than two years ago nn English
physician, connected with the British
army 1n Africa, developed a pneu
monia vaccine which is now being
generally used by the United States
army.
One or more physicians in Albu
querque now have that vaccinne. Tt
bus been demonstrated, Dr. Evans
says, that this vaccina is effective
against pneumonia for eight months.
There is no danger from its use and
the cost is nothing compared with the
insurance it gives.
The eight months one is rendered,
practically immune from pneumonia
covers the months of greatest danger
Just ahead of us, December, January,
February and March.
Because of the flu, when it is pre
ventable by vaccination, probably, and
because the death rate from it Is ren
dered nearly nothing by vaccination
against -pneumonia, this city should
not be again subjected to fiuarantine,
which, unless we make the quaran
tine so rigid that people be no't al
lowed to leave the trains here, may be
continued for two or thres years.
The Journal is not advocating com
pulsory vaccination, but lr. Iocs be
lieve that when the advantages cf
vaccination against pneumonia have
been generally understood there
should be no, quarantine for the pro
tection of these people wlio are so
careless or so skeptical as to refuse
to employ if.

.. .. In . his message to congress, the
president made it very clear that he
Is not an advocato, at this time, of
government ownership ,(f railroads.
(That his party may become such
advocate, is hardly likvly. The south
. is cservative and the railroads still
"have great influence there In the
nomination of candidates at the pri
maries. Also the example of government
operation of railroads through which
the country is now going has not en-,
tlearcd it to the people That it was
necessary for unification of control,
we have no doubt. The Interstate
commerce laws hampered the com
i panics to .such a degree tlar. capital
could not be secured for betterments.
Also the law prohibited pooling of
tracks -and rolling stock where it
could be shown that such pooling was
destructive of competition. Even
when acting under Instructions from
the war council, roads were warned
by the. United States attorney veneral
that they must not violate the law.
Then .the president ordered them
taken over n a war measure.
The administration of Director Gen
eral McAdoo was probably a.", able as
cauld have been given by any man
in America. But it Was not popuI.tr.
..because It cost so much more to the
traveling and shipping public than
formerly and the service was not so
, efficient. ;
Also let it be undorstood-ttiat the
. forty per cent increase in coft to the
public was not a producer of reverues
for carrying on the war. The cost
whs enormously increased in order
that the government might be saved
from serious loss in operating ex
penses. Whatever the government does-is so
entagled with red tape that It is bound
to cosj far more than It should cost.
It Is notorious that when a federa.1
building is to be erected no intelligent
contractor will bid less than about
double the amount he would expect to
bid on n building to be orected by a
business ma or a corpo vat Ion. Then
he nearly always loses money.
But the president is right i'l st.Uing
that railroads, if returned to opera
tion by the owners, must be freed
from the ruinous laws enacted by a
congress composed of men bent upon
currying favor with people who had
been taught that the railroads were
robbing the public, and must be pun
ished. The people who insisted upon such
regulation were not aware that they
were doing themselves more harm
than they were doing the roads. It
took the war to reveal to the public
real condition's of the common car
riers. The greatest danger to tbis country
js the demagogue. Usually he is a
man with a glib tongue and an itch
for office. In neralv all cases he has
Vnade a failure of business or profes
sional life, and he goes about telling
other people now they could be rich
and happy but for the "robber cor
porations." Never paying taxes him
self, he always know.i precisely how
taxes should be levied and by whom
paid.
Unfortunately there are always peo
ple who listen to theso glib whiffets
of a shallow school that is bent on
reforming something. Generally the
greatest need is that the reformers
reform themselves.
It seems that Marshal Foch has in
formed Berlin that the terms of the
armistice nust be complied with or
Germany will be occupied "by the arm
ies of the allies. 'Icrmany sought to
have the war ended dii her own terms,
and when the rrmist'.co was signed
the new German government fo'sns
to regard the cat-lying out f-t the
terms as on outrage.
NOT IllXE BY TKIO PEOPLE.

Richard Mueller, chief of the Ger
man Soldiers' and Workmen's coun
cil, says: . -
"We don't want a democratic re
public. We want a socialistic, nay, a
proletarian, republic. Enough has
been said." .
These men mean, as Haywood of
the I. W. W meant, that government
shall be of one class, and that the
most ignorant class of the whole
world men who havs saved nothing
for themselves, who recognize no
binding family ties, who recognize no
rulership of God, who desire that they
shall take over and use for themselves
the things other people have earned.
President Wilson declared the pur
pose of the United States in entering
the war was to "make the world safe
for democracy." But the Bolshevists of
Russia, Germany and the United
States want no' democracy; they want
rule by a class, by those who not only
have no property but who want all
property owned in common.
These modern proletarians repre
sent no considerable portion of the
working class of any country. They
may better be described ns riff-raff,
Mostly they ,have been frequenters of
saloons and dives, and have resented
the fact that now and then they had
to work for bread and lodging.
They do not build homes; they do
not want the responsibility of sup
porting families; they would not have
wifo and children to hamper them;
the harlot, satisfies their lust and they
would have the state rear all children.
Who would pay the taxes they never
state in their literature.
What the modern proletarian wants
is a world in which one person is not
more respectable than another, where
morality would bo regarded as brand
ing man or woman as an enemy
worthy of death. '. ;
In' Russia a wholesale., slaughter of
all the people who had acquired prop-
crty was planned, and some thousands
of them were actually butchered,
though the signing of the armistice
prevented the enactment of an 'en
larged St. Bartholomew's. 1 ;
President Wilson, speaking for the
American peop'e, demands that the
world be made safe for democracy.
Democracy means rule of the people,
for the people and by the people; not
rule of a certain class of the people.
Henry Ford announces that lie is
going to start a newspaper through
which he hopes to get before the
country the things he hoped to do lit
the senate. It will be far cheaper for
Mr. Ford if lie will confine his Jour
nalistic experiences to the advertising
columns. ' " '
When we are casting up the ac
count against the German people, we
should take into : consideration thnt
there must have bf en 'many thousands
of German soldiers Who never shot a
ntirse or crucified a Belgian woman
or ravished a girl in the occupied ter
ritories, f
i
The crown prince blames the gen
eral staff for failure of the war. The
kaiser blames von Bethmann-Hollweg
and von Jagow. This seems to be the
time in Germany for passing the buck,
If Mooney was not guilty of w pre
paredness day bomb outrages, who
was? He may be Innocent, but if ho,
was there is little doubt that he knows
who was guilty. . - '-..."

SAYINGS OF MRS. SOLOMON
By Helen
Verily, verily, my daughter, all the
ways of man are wonderful in his
own eyes! But the ways of a wo
man who can fathom them?!
Behold, I watched a woman sort
ing melons In the market place.
And I observed that she selected
first tho worst of tho lot and cast it
aside. And again she found tho next
to the worst, and then the third poor
est, and cast them aside, and so on
until there remained but ONE melon.
And this the "woman purchased
and carried home with her in her
knitting bag.
And the c urses of (he fruit vender
followed after her, but she smiled
tranquilly ns she departed.
Arid 1 watched a damsel In a ball
room. And lo! I saw her turn away her
partners one by one; first tho awk

Wid espread Belief in Many Laws
Which Do Not Exist in Statutes
A foreign observer, commenting on
the fact that our rather complicated
double system of federal and stuitc
laws works smoothly, concluded that
this Was becuuse Americans are a legal-minded
people. This belief is con
firmed, after a fashion, by a western
lawyer,,who asserts that the rank and
file of our population have worked
out it codo of what has been called
"curbstone" law. Many are convinced
that these arc firmly established legal
principles, but, as a matter of fact,
they are not set forth In any of our
statutes or court decisions. Thousands
are amazed to find these "unwritten
laws" do not exist.
It is generally believed that there is
a special, and very severe, penalty
for striking a man wearing eye
glasses, and many a man who deserved
a thrasing has probably escaped H for
this reason. It is possible to evade
even this "law," however, as Is shown
by the case of a bespectacled boarder
who had spoken harshly to his land
lady. Just as her husband drew back
his trusty right, she cried: "Don't hit
him! Ho Wears glasses!" Her spouse
paused, plucked the spectacles from
the nose of his opponent and then
proved to him that one shouldn't in

The cable 'told briefly how . two
Colored boys from Albany, N. Y had
held an American outpost position
against a smalt German army, ac
counting for some dozens of the
enemy, and receiving therefor French
and American decorations.
Corporal J. flush Norwood of Syl
via, Kans., met the hero of that inci
dent, Corporal Henry Johnson; and
wrote home Johnson's account of the
fight. Corporal Norwood's letter ap
pears in the Hutchinson (Kans.)
News, from which the Literary Digest
quotes: . .
Corporal Henry Johnson - himself,
who is convolescing at a nearby base
hospital, rather unexpectedly dropped
tn at the field headquarters of the
press section here and very willingly
gave a vivid and awesome story of the
event. 1 am going to try to offer it
to you as I heard it.

The amazing strength of spiders is
shown in a: number of well aithen
ticated instances. Thus we have an
instance of a half inch spider catch
ing a two inch fish. It wits of the
ground or wolf family. A scientist
came upon it struggling with a fish
on the edge of a little pool. Its
claws were buried in the fish's tail;
it had the tail out of the water, but
the head still remained underneath.
The spider struggled to pull the fish
up the bank and the fish struggled
desperately to draw the spider into
the pool. For ten minutes the
scientist watched thia silent and
deadly fight. Then he hurried away
fr a bottle In which to put the com
batants when he captured them. Ho
was gone about half aa hour, and
on his return the end had come. The
fish was dead and the spider was
slowly dragging Us victim away.

and Albuquerque Journal.)
London, Dec. 4. In a speech at
Bedford college tonight, Lord Hal
dane gave the history of the British
and French conversation, in 1906,
when there was fear of an attack on
France by Germany. On that occa
sion the French said in effect, ac
cording to Lord Haldane:
"Jf you feel it to be to your interest
to come to our assistance in order
to prevent the Invasion of Northern
France by Germany, is it not ad
visable that your military authorities
and ours should have full conversa
tions, without binding any one, but
with the view of determining the ex
tent of the military assistance you
can give?
"Informal and unbinding conver
sations were initiated at once and it
was decided that the function of any
British army might be to supplement
the great French army , with a force
strong enough to hold the Germans
whould they ,".ry to break through
some parts of Belgium.
"The French thought at that time
that if we could contribute 100,000
men, capable of concentrating on
their left within fifteen days of the
outbreak of the war, that would be
enough to enable them to hold their
position.
"We found all we could concentrate
wculdxbe 80,000 men, and It would
take (is at least two and one-half
months to assemble that number. The
French said to us:
" 'But we would be dead before you
came,' and they were, right."
Passing to the British preparations
for the war, more than four years
ago. Lord Haldane said:
"We had to make a revolution tn
our military arrangements, and it was
made under the guidance of Sir
Douglas Haig and a number of other
officers.
"In the end, 50 per cent was added
to the French estimate, and we put
not 100,000 but 2fi0,000 in the field,
and not in fifteen days but in twelve.
We mobilized in August, 1914, thirty
six hours before .we declared war.
Within a few hours after the declara
tion of war, our expeditionary force
was across the channel, before any
body knew it" , .
