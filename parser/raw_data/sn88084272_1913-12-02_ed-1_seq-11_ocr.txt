MORMONS DENY THEY
PRACTICE POLYGAMY
Hot Discussion Arises in Meeting of Na
tional Reform Association Over
Fronosed Amendment.
Pittsburjr, Pa., Dec. 2. At the 50th
annual convention of the National Re
form association, which is dealing with
Mormonism, immigration and other sub
jects, a resolution offered by Prof. O.
F. Davis, of New Richmond, Wis., call
ing on congress to prohibit polygamy
and polygamous cohabitation inall the
states, territories and dependencies, was
adopted. Prof. Davis is chairman of the
world's commission on Mormonism.
R. Murray Stewart, of Ambridge, Pa.,
a missionary of the Church of Christ
of the Latter Day Saints, strenuously
objected to the resolution. "Such an
amendment is not necessary to the laws
of our country," he said, "for polygamy
is not and has not been practiced in
Utah or any other state since 1890. 1
defy anyone to prove that polygamy
is still practiced in Utah. Our churches
there or anywhere else are open to in
vestigation at any time by anyone.
Points Out President Smith.
W. M. Padden, of Salt Lake City, an
swered Mr. Stewart's objections.
"I have lived among the Mormons for
15 years and I know that they fear the
adoption of that amendment to the
United States constitution more than
any other amendment ever suggested,"
he said. "As for the assertion of Mr.
Stewart that polygamy has not been
practiced since 189Q the year of the
"Woodruff manifesto I have here a pic
ture showing Joseph Smith and his wives
and their children, taken in the year
1912. Is that not proof that polygamy
has been practiced since the issuance of
that manifesto!"
Leon liurdick, also a missionary of tho
Church of Christ of the Latter Day
Saints, informed Mr. Padden and the
convention that the church was willing
at anv time to disprove the charges ol
alleged polygamous actions of the Mor
mons. Taking part in the debate were elders
Jain Scott of Smithfield, Utah; Prank
Bacon of Eureka, Utah; David Jones
of Provo, Utah, and Wilfred Tolman of
Fairview, Wyo.
TORPEDO BOAT IS
BATTERED BY STORM
Santa Cruz, Calif., Dec. 2. With her
wireless apparatus, one mast and one
lifeboat gone, and two other lifeboats
smashed, the torpedo boat destroyer
Tmxton arrived in the harbor here late
Monday after battling for two days with
the most severe storm in the experience
of her officers and crew. For the greater
part of the two days not a man on the
Truxton took time to eat, and for hours
at a stretch it seemed impossible to
prevent the little vessel foundering.
When she arrived Hiere she virtually
was out of coal and water and fresh
supplies are beinor taken aboard so that
the Truxton may resume her voyage to
San Francisco. In company with four
other destroyers, the Truxton left San
Pedro for San Francisco, and a few
hours out of the southern port ran into
the storm. Waves 40 feet high sub
merged the Truxton repeatedly.
URGE GOVENRMENT TO
SURVEY SABINE RIVER
Washington, D. C, Dec. 2. Senator
Sheppard and representative Dies, for
Texas, and representatives Aswell and
Watkins, for Louisiana, today appeared
at a hearing before the board of army
engineers and urged a covernment sur
vey of the Sabine river with a view to
its improvement for navigation.
The survey would cost $300,000. The
Texas and Louisiana congressional dele
gations are a unit in asking the survey.
Sheppard and representatives Dies also
urged improvements for the Colorado
river.

WILSON AGAIN SEEKS
POST FOR PINDELL
flllnolsan Is Renominated For Ambas
sador to Itnssla Senate Refuses to
Vote on Money IIII1 Dec. 20.
Washington, D. C. Dec. 2. Henry M.
PindeS, the Peoria. IIL, publisher, was
renominated today by president Wilson
for ambassador to Russia. Pindell's

because of publication of certain al

inated for minister to Belgium, and
Geofrey Williams, of Boston, was nom

tenegro. WInired T. Denlson. of New York,
was renominated for secretary of the
interior of the Philippines.

nated for .receiver of public moneys at
BureKa, uam.
The senate met at 11 oclock and
refused to agree to vote on- the admin
istration currency bill on December 20.
The senate Democrats began an en
ergetic program which they expect will
force early action. Senator Williams,
of Mississippi, announced that It was
the intention of the Democrats to ex
haust the senate and force an early
vote. Senator Bristow attacked, in un
measured terms and at length, the
Democratic program and declared the
Democrats proposed to pass a bill by
"physical exhaustion." Instead of fair
and free debate.
"This has been a bodv of intellectual
Iscussion, a place where information
w48-a a par and physical endurance
not at ft" premium," he cried. "The
place to test physical endurance is in
the prize ring, not m-thesenate."
Senators Owen and Shaffoth-etorted
that Senator Bristow and the" other
Republicans already had delayed the"
currency bill by demanding hearings
and prolonging debate.
Republican senators at a conference
decided to formally protest against the
long sessions proposed by the Demo
crats, but to enter on no organized op
position. N
The senate then recessed, to join the
house to hear president Wilson read
his annual message.
The house net at noon.
President Wilson read hlg annual
message to the joint session at 1
oclock.
Chairman Clayton called a meeting
of the judiciary committee for tomor
