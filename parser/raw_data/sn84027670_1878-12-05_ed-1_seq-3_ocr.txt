The conduct of Maj. Reno upon the oc

command is shortly to be made the sub

military officer who will organise and

Heatt storms are reported on the New
England coast. There is ground for the
apprehension that these atmospheric dis
turbances may have extended far enough

Mr. Sitekijas expects that the sub
scriptions for the 4 per cent, bonds this
year will amount to atleeast f 100,000,000,
and that at least three times that sum
will bt taken in 1879, when the bonds
will be purchasable with common currren-
Ax occasional item floats up to show
that some once prominent man is still left
to the world that has about forgotten
him. This thought is suggested by the

as judge of a superior court in Geor

Secretary Sherman estimates that
the amount of permanent annual appropria
tions needed for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 18S0, will be $145,939,433; ap
propriations other than permanent, $129,
197,812; total, $275,137,250. This is a re
duction of $5,551,545 from the estimates
of 1879.
The opinion of Gen. Sheridan regard

Eiowa Indians from Ft. Sill to the Wichi

yet to hear from poor Lo.
The European conscience must be very

XLVxir CONGRESS.
SEX1XE.
Messrs. Anthony and Bayard were appointed
a committee to iofn the House committee and
notify the President Congress had assembled.
Bills were laid on the table pending the ap
pointment of a committee, by Beck, to provide
tor retiring trade aoiiars ana lor its coinage
into standard silver dollars; also to authorize
the purchase of foreign built ships by citizens
of the United States.
By Mr. VooThees, instructing the committee
on finance to inquire into the expediency of
making the trade dollar a legal tender fur all
debts public and private, and of providing for
its recoinage into the standard -silver dolhir of
412JJ grains.
By Jlr. Blaine, instructing the Judiciary
committee to report to the Senate whether at
the recent elections the constitutional rights of
any citizens were violated in any State, what
further legislation is necessary to protect the
citizens in their rights, etc
Ilesolutions providing for a joint committee
to inquire into the canse and spread of the
yellow fever, what legislation is necessary to
prevent its introduction into this country, etc
The vice-president laid before the Senate
the credentials of Hon. Justin S. Morrill, re
elected Uaitsd States Senator irom Vermont
for six years from March 4, 1879. Read and
placed en file
ltecrss.
The only Senators allien to-day were Messrs.
Barnum. CuckrelL Conkling, Gordon, Hoar,
Jones, of Nevada, Kcrnan, Merriman, Patter
son, Plumb, Sargent, Sharon, Spencer and
White.
Upon reassembling, the message of the Pres
dent was received and read. The reading con
cluded, tho message was laid on the table and
ordered printed. The senate then adjourned
till to-morrow.
nocsc
The gallerier contained the customary crowd
at the opening session of congress.
At noon speaker Baudall rapped the house to
order, when the chaplain made prayer and the
roll waB called.
Boll call showed 223 members present. Two
new members, Bailey, of New iork. and Ma
jors, of Nevada, then took the ironclad oath,
and Messrs. Atkins, Cox and Garfield were p
pointetl to inform the President that Con
gress was in session. After recess the Presi
dent's message was received from Private Sec
retary lingers and read.
When the reading of the message was ended
Mr. Wood, of New York, rose and moved that it
be referred to the committee of the whole of
the House, and ordered printed, but first ho de
sired to make some comments, uon it. Al
though, as a whole, the document was highly
satisfactory, yet there were some references in
it which should be met at the earliest practic
able moment. He referred to that part
relating to the Southern States. He (Mr.
Wood) failed to see where the President
saw any diiqiosition in the South to avoid or
annul in any degree the recent constitutional
amendments. He failed to see any indication
in such, at any election, at any time under any
circumstances, for a series of years of an un
willingness to live in entire amity with the
whole country in regard to the laws or to obey
tbegorcrnment. He regretted the president, ho
had commenced his administration with
such a noble and patriotism iHmtion as against
the military despotism exercised by his pre
decessor, should now indicate a cnange oi pol
icy. He had watched with interest the causes
of the administration in order to see whether
the president would be forced from the manly
ssd noble position taken by him. He
knew that there was" a lrtg of the
Republican party dissatisfied with that
position and it had been a matter nf interest
to the whole country to know whether the Pres
ident would continuously maintain his atti
tude; while the President expressed his views
in very mild and very decorous language, J et
be indicated quite clearly that the condition of
things in the South was not satisfactory to him.
An animated discussion ensued, participated
in by Messrs. Wood. Garfield, Hale, and Cox,
of New York. Finally Wood's motion to refer
and print the message was agreed to.
The military academy and fortification ap
propriation bills were reportep, and notice waa
given ot an early action on tncm.
The House then adjourned.

The intention of Russia to interfere in
Afghanistan is apparently confirmed by the
Moscow Gazettr, declaring that intervention is
indispensible, now that the occupation of
Ruettah has been succeeded by the expeditions
in the direction of Candabar and Herat.
GENERALITIES.
ABOUT THE ESDI ASS.
The secretary of the interior, in his an
nual report refers to his recommendation of
last year in regard to the Indians, and proceeds
to say that the consolidation of a number of
agencies has been undertaken with a view to
the better location of the Indians, which will
at the same time simplify the service, render
a more efficient supervision possible, reduce
the expenses of government and lessen the op
portunities for fraud and peculation. As far
aa the appropriations made by Congress
would permit, agricultural implements and
domestic cattle have been furnished to In
dian tribes to set the Indians to work for
their own support and to encourage indus
trious hat its. An Indian police force has
been organized at twenty two agencies, and
from all of them favorable reports as
to the working of the new system have
been received. Instruction' have been riven
to discriminate in the distribution of supplies
and annuities which are nut actual necessaries,
against individual Indians who show no dispo
sition to work, thus discouraging idleness.
Permission to send out hunting parties has
been given only where, without hunting, In
diana would have been exposed to want. The
allotment of land among the Indians on the
several reservations has been ordered and is in
progress. The facilities of education have
been extended aa much aa possible, and proper
directions have been given for the instruction
of Indian children in practical pursuits. The
Indian service has been reorganized in several
of its branches. It was found necessary to re
move numbers of agents on account of improp
er practices or lack of business efficiency, and
great care has been taken in filling their places
with new men.
Canada's jnrw governor.
The day of the landing of the Marquis
of Lome in Halifax, opened fine with a clear
atmosphere. The official landing of the Vice
regal party was made at 1:30 in the afternoon.
At 11 o'clock the Sarmatian weighed anchor
and moved np the harbor, the forts firing royal
salute as the vessel passed. The Sarmatian
steamed up slowly, keeping in the center of
the channel, and forts York, redoubt. Point
Pleasant, George's Island and the Citadel
thundered salutes in succession. The wharfs
along the harbor and Citadel were crowded
with people. Steam tugs and small boats
followed the Vice-regal paity. The fleet at
anchor off the dock-) ard also fired salutes as
the Sarmatian left her anchorage, and on her
approach the yards of each vessel were Ban
ned and as the vessel passed the men cheered
lustily, and the bands played "God Save the
Queen." The sight was magnificent in the
harbor, all the vessels being decked gailv
with bunting. The Vice-regal party were on
deck coming into the city, well prepared for a
grand reception which followed.
Kansas orriciAL.
The official returns from every organwed
county in Kansas for the vote on State officers
foot np aa follows:
Beaconsfield conferred upon the En
glish sovereign the title of "Empress of
India," and a time has arrived when a
good use can be made of the change. The
Imperial title appeals far more strongly
to the East Indian native imagination
than could one that suggested continually
the vassalage in which they were held to
a far away queen.
It is announced that the President in
his annual message at the reassembling
of Congress will lay before that body a
si atcment of the occurrences in the South
at the recent elections, and call attention
to the necessity for some action that will
more effectually conserve the purity of tho
ballot-box and afford protection to citizens
in the exercise of their political rights.
- Lokdon papers intimate that the Brit
ish forces will not advance very far into
Afghanistan this year. It is admitted
that the invading columns are not strong
enough for an extended campaign, and
tho severity of the winter will soon put a
stop to all military operations. The time
until spring will be devoted to prepara
tions for the hard and dangerous work
which has been going on.
The progress of the English in their
present march on Afghanistan singularly
resembles the beginning ot the campaign
against the same country which proved so
disastrous to British arms something less
than forty years since. Then, as now,
the forward rush was one long tale of vic
tory, but once beyond the Khyber pass
and within the mare of rocks and canons
which fill the route to Cabul, every defile
seemed swarming with deirons.
CRIMINALITIES.
alDULED WITH BULLETS.
The barn of John T. A en, a. prominent
farmer living near Farmington, TeniL, was set
on fire, and when the owner stepped ont of his
door he was riddled with bullets by a man
named Porter, whom he had prosecuted fur
nurse stealing.

perpetrators.

INCEND1ART.
The recent fire in the Virginia peniten
tiary has been discovered to have been the re
sult of a slow match placed in one corner of
the building destroyed by a prisoner.
Last week we claimed that the Green
back vote would run np to three-quarters
of a million. We find that we under-estimated
the vote f Missouri 20,000; the
tote of New York 11.000; the vote of
Pennsylvania 7,000; and the vote of Mich
igan 15,000. Counting the Butler vote in
Massachusetts, the combined National
and Democratic vote in Iowa, and the La
bor vcte in California, the Greenback party
has polled over a million votes.
A DETACniiEXT of revenue officer has
been fired upon in Abbeville, South Caro
lina, and it is alleged that the lives of the
party were saved only by the intercession
of the farmer in whoe house the officers
had taken refuge. The continued success
of the illicit distillers in South Carolina
in resisting the law has become a nation
al scandal, and it is to be hoped that
measure will be taken to suppress the
mobs which have complete possession of
certain district.
It is understood .in Washington that
Secretary Sherman will recommend, in his

The steamer Pommerania, of the Ham
burg American line, was wrecked inthe British
channel, off the coast of France, last week.
The loss of life was very large, including many
Americans who had left New York to spend
the winter in Uurope. On her way from Ply
mouth to Hamburg the steamer collided with
the bark Noel Kilian. The large steamer sunk
in les than twenty minntes. There were nine
boats on the Pommerania. four of which were
crushed in the collision, five were got off, but
one being overcrowded with passengers, was
sunk. All the boats pulled away from the
doomed ship leaving the captain, who refuted
to quit the ship till the last moment. The
lat boat to leave was that of the under chief
officer who did all in his power to persuade the
captain to leave. After pulling for half an
hour, the survivors were picked up by the
Mlengarry. une gentleman was taken irom
the water in an unconscious state and restored.
The Glengarry staved near the scne till day
break, when the Pommerania was seen with
her mast above water. The Glengarry then
proceeded to Dover and landed the passenger
at 3 o'clock, who were taken to the bailors

order under the circumstances was maintain

TBC ELECTRIC LI OUT.
Edison in a recent interview manifested
no diminution of confidence in bis ultimate
success with the electric light that is to super
sede gas. A man must have some reason con-
clnsire to his own mind for the faith that is
in him who goes so far as to assert that be
can by the use as fuel of gas purchased at
present prices produce an electric light bet
ter and cheaper than the same degree of illu
mination, produced by the burning of the
gas itself. This is what Edison says can be
done.

THE .MARKETS.
WKCaXT OBADI KEVIZW.
We are indebted to Messrs. Lyude,
Wright 4 Cul, of Kansas City, for the following
reliable review of the grain trade:
Vt heat The situation of the wheat marketa
home and foreign are in nowise chanzed from
a week ago. The same continental demand
continues for our winter wheat, and low
grades spring. aloes in leading and country
foreign markets are relatively unchanged.
Supplies are sufficient "to leave surplus in
English and French warehouses after meeting
the wanta of the consumer. Lower rates by
rail have stimulated larger shipments from
lower Russia and Austro Hungarv. The polit
ical situation in Europe . is undisturbed, and
confidence is gradually returning to the home
of English industries.
The spring wheat markets are still "throt
tled by tneAewiork clique, and their efforts
seem to tend towards acenttomine outside
parties to present forced prices befure unload-
nig. iua iAftiH possession oi me maraeis oi
the country operate seriously against foreign
orders and misleads shipper when least ex
pected. The wheat valves of. the whole coun
try" are to a greater or less extent shifted from
day to day at the caprine of a few capitalists.
The situation, hoaever, is not without its com
pensations. It ha stifled 4 he cry of the
"scalper" or chronic "short seller" whose voice
has always been against the producer.
When these "bulls" may let go or force val
ue to a higher range is a constant query for
dealers. Future values therefore are hated
upon no trade estimates; our daily reports are
but the points showing the manipulations of a
ring.
Cobn The reaction in this cereal ccted a
week ago has given away to a heavier feeling,
and values have declined a fraction since last
review. Export clearances have been light,
weather continues faroralile fur husking the
new crop, which is now about secured, in Illi
nois and Iowa aa well as Kansas, and tjie gen
eral cheapness of feeding staffs work dis
advantageously to the seller. The movement
to interior markets and the seaboard for the
week was equal to previous week, and the
close of lake navigation will ot favor holders
in western market.
Oats There has been no change in values
and the movement to market is fair. A small
amount has been taken for export, and for
eign orders are light.
Kte hjeport clearances for the week were
72J155 bus., and deliveries from farmer show
light reduction. Our German customer of
late have been largely supplied from Western
Bussia, this source interfering with our for
eign demand very seriously, values unchanged

One of the wealthiest settler in New

who went there some ten or twelve jears

The traveler i kindly n-o-hed; nothing

on his revolver and other weapons o-tnta-tjouy

mained unchanged thrtnsbont the nicht.
A terrible nicht it was. no doubt, for the

WARNED BY A DKTECTIVE.
"Now, Mr. Baker, letlus understand
each other at ouce," Lord Hudson had
-aid. leaning back in his otttcial arm-chair,
and tapping the maive s'j-net ring; on
hi fat finger with the official paper cut

"my time is positively not my own.
And j took the under-secretary's hint,
and retired, almost tumbling over the ex
cited deputation as I made my way down
stairs. Next week Cecil Manvers and I
went abroad.
Our fir.t year of continental travel
passed off pleanantly enough. I found ray
tmpil not merely intelligent and quick to
learn, but bricht. frank, and unasMimin?.
and singularly docile for so spirited a lad.
it, was me time when the grand Tans
Exhibition Exhibitions had not an jet
grown common enough to be classed" as
bores attracted iiij riails to the then im
perial capital of France. Emneror. court
and empire were in their first ireshness,
decked, too, with the prestige which suc
cess confers; for the great struggle with
itussia was going on victoromly for tho
allies and the cordial feeling between
France and England wa. at its warmest.
In 18-Vi teoiiie had not vet lienims
ashamed of enioung themselves, ami
whatever the merit of the show mi"ht !.
it certainly recured the sulfragcs of the
wcll-dreasisl, well pleaded crowds of holi
day maker. My pupil and I made the
falace or Industry our daily lounge, and
so did a French triend of ourv, destined to
play no unimportant part in this story.
It was by accident that we had made
acquaintance with Colonel the Baron
Duplesis. Cecil had a walking cane,
with a handsome gold head, which had
belongrtl to his father, anil the cane he
ciiauceii to leave em one ot the marble ta
bles of the Exhibition monster restaurant.
Halt an hour later, when my pupil dis
covered his loss and went back in hot
hasbi to seek for his mining roorty, it
was courteously re-tored to him, with it
bow and a mile. by a tall, elderly French
man, with the inevitable red riblion adorn
ing his tightlv buttoned frock coat, and
of what his compatriots desimialrd as a
distinguished appearance. Tin's old of-
hcerhad ob-erved ourselves a the occu
pants of the table near bis own, and had
been prompt enough to precnt tho costly
walking stick from being purloined by a
light-fingered nnder-waiter. Tins little
kindness let! in time to a friendship whuh
might le called intimate.
The Colonel, a became a man of an
cient lineage and reduced fortuue, lived
in a gloomy old street on the left bank of
the Seine, tar away from the glare and
glitter of the modernj'aris. The Hue d
Ioches was the name of the street, and
the Colonel's houe. No. 1C, was on the
shady side of it a big dingy mansion,
with a grass grown court-yard, a walled
garden, and windows into which the
sun never seemed to shine. The Colonel's
family consisted merely of his wife and
daughter; theiormerhaggHrd and nervous,
the latter plain and stupid, with a fright
ened look. I thought, in her dull eyes.
Madame la baronne spoke little and mad
emoisellej like mo-t well brought np
French g'rls. was a mute a a fiih.
The only attraction in No. IP. Kncde
Laches, was the gay good humor, tam
pered iiy the diimified shrewdness of as
experiencril man of the world, of it mas
ter. 31. Uuplessis. even to mr. seemed
singularly agrcanble. and gained a still
larger share of Cecil's regard. It so haj
pened that my pupil had a turn for mil
itary subjects less, t-erhaps. for drcs and
drill than for the scientific side of a sol
dier life and his boyih curiosity remed
to pica; the Colon!, who himseff was, a.
ne sain eiingiy, merely a worn out war
horse turned out to grass, Imt ready to re
spond to the firt twang of the tmmpi.
So it rame about that Cecil and the Harun
made frequent excursions, now to be pres
ent at the trial of a nfled cannon, now to
Air' Sext.

On me Iiis extraordinary assertion pro

aw ay my breath, and I sat gasping and
staring-in Mank amazement. 'I hen I ml

set out for the Hue dc Loehes.
It was ery dark, and as I croed the

raised mr band to the tall handle of "o.

pushed it open, passed in, and silently re
closeil it bihmd me. No one observed me
as I cro.se.1 the gnus grown court-yard,
and, unch llleiiged, ! tered the big old
house, the windows of which were now
ablaze with Jiglit. while strains of music
reached my tars, mingling with the elms
of glasses mi si the murmur of coiicration.
The well known staircase, however, wa

going on, and in it Oni eighteen or nine-,

A train and anin liie ranis were

Cecil. The p;le of gold befi rt him sw!M
anil swelled, until at last, vnth a mntte,
ed oath, the Iat stake of the bank w tr
luctantly pushed toward my tJoiul.
"Broke the bank, by Jove' : said I'd

and spirit tocand he had the effrontery
to tell me to-night that he was ashamed
of playing trick on his good-natured tu

more.'
The stout-built man responded with
some brutal joke ab-rat tender young
pigeou that was ready for the spit.
"There was no risk, no risk at all,'
said tnc eldest of the scoundrels; "what
can they prove against us hein? Tho

insisted on retumimr home oit toot, with

the big man. snapping his finger; "and

such a.load to the riverside streets. Bet

the last drunkard ha reeled homeward."
And then all five at down together at
tliea table in familurconversation, much of
which was to me unintelligible, sipping
Curacoa and Chartreuse the while with
appreciative relish. The only one who
looked careworn and anxious was the
Colonel himself. I did not, however, linger
long to play t':e part ot enve-droper.
Clearly, it I would saveCccil, I nntloeno

cantiouly, 1 threaded my wst through
the darkling ante-clmmWrs, and down
the solitary stircae. I reached the court

ing the gate, I-rlided out into the street,
and. mindful of the nddievs which M. Car

to No. 7 line Joachim.
The inspector of police listened with
eager interest to my torv. Twice he in
terrupted me, with an uroaue apology for
the rudeness of the a-t, that he might ap
ply his lips to the mouth-piece of a call
pipe that communicated with the lower
