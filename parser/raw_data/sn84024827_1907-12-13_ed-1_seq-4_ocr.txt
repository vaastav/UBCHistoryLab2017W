CONTROLLING
CORPORATIONS.
Business having been centralized,
:entralization of control 13 also nec
issary, is the cry of those who de
nand federal charters for corpora
tions engaging in interstate com
merce. The excuse is specious, but
the reason absurd. The states can
tako care of the big corporations Tcry
easily if the federal courts will let
them, says the St. Louis Republic.
As a matter, of fact, it is tho man
agers of the great corporations who
are back of the movement for feder
al incorporation. They want to shel
ter their companies and their busi
ness under the cloak of a national
charter because they believe the'power
of the Individual states has been and
will be used to their injury. The pre
tense that supervision "can only be
effectively exercised by a sovereign
whose Jurisdiction is coextensive with
the field work of the corporations" is
constantly contradicted by tho com
plaint that tho power of the suites is
oppressively exercised.
There is a measure of reason in
the objection that the corporation do
ing business in -a number of states
is inconvenienced, it not actually ha
rassed, by the varying laws it must
meet, but that inconvenience is an
essential Incident to our form of gov
ernment through, federated states. Un
doubtedly our federation has Its in
conveniences, but today, just as much
as In the day when our national con
stitution was adopted. It is wise ip en
dure the Inconveniences of our pe
culiar form of government In 'order
to enjoy the benefits which its check
upon centralized power affords.
What dangers we should invite If
the national government took up the
control of all tho corporations doing
an interstate -business may be gath
ered from the program outlined in
President Roosevelt's message to con
gress last week. He would have them
barred front interstate commerce un
til a federal license Is obtained. Ho
would make an ofScial valuation of
the property of the railroads, at least,
and possibly all corporations char
tered by the United States. He would
have the government prevent their
engaging In "unhealthy competition."
but would grant permission for "reas
onable agreements'' restricting compe
tition. And these but begin the cata
logue.
President Tloosevelt told congress
that what he Reeks Is such a supervi
sion of corporations generally as the
national government ndw exercises
over cations! banks. But the things
he would have the government do
saeck even saore of downright des-jwtlem-
than anything the comptroller
Ttfce ean-eficy sajuiio uader the au
iority givea bias by the Rational
Mtnking lawv The thing- Mr. Roose-
relt seeks is evidently tho larger an-
Aority the postal .department exer-
within the scope of discretion accord
ed by law which not even the supreme
court of tho United States may re
view. So President Roosevelt would
have it' la the supervision and control
01 ait Dusiness corpoiauons. 'such a
law," ho said to congress in his mes
sage, "to ba really effective must, of
course, be administered by an execu
Uvo body, and not merely by means
of lawsuits."
It Is not necessary to picture the
tremendous power a' law of this kind
would give the executive branch of
the "national governmenL It Is a
power that has stirred a storm of com
plaint against the postal department,
but that is merely a zephyr beside
the whirlwind that would sweep the
country when realization of the au
thority given the secretary of com
merce came to tho business interest.
If such a law as congress Is asked to
enact should be granted. It Is quite
safe to say ther recommendation will
disappear forever in the committee
to which it is referred.
James E. Watson, the republican
"whip" in the national house of rep
resentatives, is aspiring to the repub
lican nomination for governor of In
diana. Ho has represented the Sixth
Indiana district for a number of years.
James G. Blaln of Maine was speak
er for eight years longer than any
other man 'ever presided over tho de
liberations of the house. Schuyler
Colfax and Samuel Randall each oc
cupied the speaker's chair for seven
sessions.

CANNON STINGS
CORTELYOU.
"None but an ass," said Speaker
Cannon on Thursday, "would suggest
a bond issue to--build waterways,
when there is a surplus In the treas
ury." These words were peevishly
addressed to the delegation which vis
ited his office in tho capltol to present
him a handsome copy of the resolu
tions adopted by the Deep Water
ways convention at Memphis in Octo
ber.
R'JfT!l- as were
the tempers of
some of the delegates by this blunt
discourtesy, the words flew far
enough above their heads to sting the
president and the secretary of the
treasury if Ihey arO at all sensitive
to what Uncle Cannon may Bay.
Though there is a surplus of nearly
$250,005,000 in the treasury. Is not
Secretary Cortelyou, with the approv
al of the president now in, the act of
making "a bond fssue to build a waterway?"
Official .Washington should await
with expectancy, an. explanation of
these 'double-hitting" words. Uncle
Cannon is too- old In the ways of
Washington to send a verbal shot at
one mark and hit another. If he did
not mean to hit two birds with the
one stone he has become very much
less expert a marksman than he has
heretofore been accounted to be.
This is not the first Indication of a
cooling between the speaker and the
administration. His first official visit
of the session t the white house wa3
made at a time when he must have
known that the president would be
busy and that he could only send in
his card.
JUs candidacy for the presidential
nomination of his party must be dis
pleasing to President RoosevelL and
Mr. Speaker dees not seem to care if
It is. And now. In effect he calls
President Roosevelt's secretary of the
treasury an ass. Did he sting Secre
tary txjnejyou tcrougn sneer awk
wardness, or deliberately and with
malice aforethought?
Republicans who are keeping tab
on the course of events In Indiana ex
press the belief that the sentiment for
Hughes la that state is constantly
gaining In strength. It is -their belief
that if Fairbanks were not a candi
date for the presidency tho New York
.J of the Indiana delegation to the na
tional couTemioa uexi year.
Attorney General Edward T. Young
of Minnesota, who was fined $100 for
contempt by Judge Loehran of tho
United States district court in the
railroad cases which he Is fighting
for the state, may be a candidate for
United Slates senator to succeed
Moses T. Clapp, whose term will ex
pire In 1909.
Exra sessions are as old as con
gress Itself, the first haring " been
called together January 4, 1790, a lit
tle over three months after the first
session ever held came to a close.
Next camo the extra session of the
fifth rongress, then others during the
eleventh and thirteenth, after which
there was a lapse of twenty-four years
before It was deemed necessary to
meet more than Oncovin two years.
John W. Kern, who is mentioned as
the possible successor of Thomas Tag
gart as Indiana member of the demo
cratic national committee, is a native
of Indiana, a graduate of tho Univer
sity of Michigan, and a lawyer by pro
fession. He began his public career
in 1892 as a member of the state sen
ate. In 1900 ana again in 1904 he
was the unsuccessful candidate of the
democrats for governor of Indiana in
1905 ho received tho complimentary
vote of his party for United States
senator-.
