THE PRESENT CONGRESS.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Senator Quay's "mailed hand" has
already shown itself in national af
fairs at Washington. He was the
'warm supporter of Reed for the speak
ership and that gentleman owes his
place to Quay.
The reason why Quay wanted Reed
is that he can rely on him to do any
thing that will help the radical party.
Mr. Reed is an ultra partisan. He
hates the South, and he liates the
.Democratic party as the devil hates
holy water. He is a man of strong
intellect and much vior and is just
he man of all other to try to bull
doze the Democratic minority. That
is why Quay wanted him.
From these two worthies, Reed in
the chair and Quay to turn the crank,
we shall be surprised if some high
handed election laws, directed against
the South, are not soon forthcoming
from the congressional mill.
In the Senate, Mr. Reed will have
many co-workers in any effort he may
make to impose unjust laws on the
South. They have begun early. As
we see in the dispatches from Wash
lsgtou. Senators Frye and Chandler
were on hand promptly with their lit
tie bills for an election law. These
bills will be placed on the calendar at
the earliest practical moment and will
probably come up Boon.
We gave the readers of The Sen
tinel an outline of Chandler's Dill a
few weeks ago. It provides for the
appointment of supervisors ot congres
sional elections, who shall act ss a can
assing board and declare the result ;
that voters must be registered, and
limits the application of the bill to
elections for representatives in Con
gress within ths States of South Caro
lina, Florida, Mississippi and Loui
siana. Senator Sherman's bill provides for
the appointment by the President, to
be confirmed by the Senate, of a State
board of canvassers of five voters and
Doara ot three voters in each con
gressional district. These boards shall
i i i : tu-
uunug guuu ueuaviur. iuc
01 ate board shall appoint a registrar
of elections in each congressional dis
tnct, to serve six years' The district
boards shall select three citizens in
their respective districts, who shall
constitute the judges of elections for
all federal elections, to serve six years.
Tho district board shall also appoint
three commissioners of election for
sach'county, city or corresponding po
litical division in the congressional
district. These commissioners shall
canvass the vote. The judges of elec
tion shall not all be of one political
party. Th Secretary of the Interio
shall turnish the registration books.
The electoral board of each congres
sional District shall in the month of
April of each year of a general elec.
tion certify to the Secretary of State
the number of election districts and
number of voters in each, and the Sec
retary of State thereupon shall transmit
to the board duplicate poll books in
each district.
Benny Harrison has delivered his
message to Congress. It came Tues
day and was nothing more nor less
than was to have been expected. He
touches lightly and deals in the most
glittering generalities when discussing
the gravest affairs of state. If we
could sum up his message in one sen
tence it would be about as follows:
Senators and members, you who are
the guardians of American liberty, go
ahead and make as big a show at do
ing nothing as possible and don't for
get that the Republican party must
win next time.
It is too little a thing, stretched out
too lone to fit The Sentinel's col
umns, so we can only touch on one or
two points. In the part which may
be fairly termed bis own, one striking
feature is the recommendation that
the Federal Government "take the
whole direction and control of the
election of members of the House of
Representatives." This is a distinct
approval of the Sherman Congression
al Election bill a most damnable
scheme for depriving the South of its
coDgressmen an outline of which we
print this week.
The President's idea of impartiality
in the administration of Civil Service
may be gleaned from this paragraph :
When those holding administrative
offices so conduct themselves as to
convince just political opponents that
no party consideration or bias affects
in any way the discharge of their pub
lic duties, we can more easily stay the
demand for removals.
If this does not mean that any
Democratic incumbent who desires to
remain in place must buy his retention
by subserviency to local Republican
leaders, politicians will be at a loss to
translate the language of their craft.
These two are about the only ideas
that stick up above the common
plain of dull platitudes, and they serve
to show that, above all things, Hani-
sun is a partisan and desires the sue
cess of the Republican party far more
than he does the welfare of the Amer
ican people.
SENSATIONAL PREACHING.
-ri i ii.
ine man woo mages a Da D boon or
a bar-room humorist of himself in the
pulpit for the sake of notoriety and
cash ought to wear stripes instead of
being rewarded.
On the contrary, the preacher who
ministers to his people from year to
year, rejoicing in their gladness and
weeping in their day of sorrow de
serves far better reward than he re-
- .1 t m .
ceivea at -we nanas oi the average
North Carolina community.
We are led to these remarks by the
act that Bill Fife, the "drummer
evangelist" raked in $300 during a
two week's "revival" in Reidsville,
While the pastor of the church in
which he preached receives only $600
per year and, a few weeks before Fife
went there, told his people that he
actually didn't have money enough to
buy a pair of shoes to cover his feet !
This same story has been repeated
several times in North Curolina and
will go on indefinitely until the peo
ple awake to the fact that it isn't,
common honesty to starve their home
minister while pouring gold into the
pockets of a travelling religious moun
bank. , Sam Jones may be all right and
.Bill life may be an bumble follower
k ot the Lord Jesus Christ, but they use
language in the pulpit which if used in
the parlor would cause them to be
kicked into the street, and people go
to hear them as they go to the circus
to see the spotted clown.
When we come to decide where our
money thall go, it should not take us
long to decide that the local minister
is the man we owe it to, rather than
to the sensationalist. Stick a pin right
, herb, brethren, and don't forget it.
THE "BLIND HAN ELOQUENT" RE
ELECTED.
The opening of the session of Con
gre S3, says the Baltimore Sun, was at
tended by no surprises until toward
the close of the second day's proceed
ings in the House. In the House Mr.
Reed was made Speaker by a vote of
166 as against 154 for Mr. Carlisle and
one for Curamings, of New York.
Speaker Reed acknowledged the hon
or confered to him in a brief speech,
and the session began with everybody
in a good humor. A flurry was pro
duced, however, when Mr. Cheadle, a
republican, bolted the candidate of his
caucus for chaplain and moved the
substitution of the name of Mr. Mil-
burn, the blind Democratic chaplain
of the last House, whom the people
of Winstcn will recollect, as he lect
ured here last spring on "What A
Blind Man Saw In Paris." Several
republicans joined Cheadle, and with
their help the democrats, after a spirit
ed struggle, elected Milburn by a vote
of 166 to 155. The incident shows
how difficult it may be for the repub
licans to carry party measures in the
present House. Their majority when
all members are present being not ov
er eight, and under ordinary circum
stances likely to fall to two or three,
or even disappear altogether, they are
subject to all sorts of accidents. The
caprice of one offended republican,
the sickness of another, the alsence of
a third, and an accident to a fourth
may at any time break a quorum or
fake division result the wrong way.
Arbitrary measures with the minori
ty are clearly impracticable under the
circumstances.

The Montana Democrats have sev
eral strings to their bow. If they can
not get their nine members elected in
Silver Bow county admitted to the
Legislature, as they should be, they
can hold the State Senate in a dead
lock during ninety days, which is the
legal limit of its session. The Demo
cratic Governor can thereupon ap
point two Democratic United States
Senators. The Legislature might, with
its rightful Democratic majority, elect
two Democrats in the usual way, but
the trouble about this is that the rival
Republican Legislature would elect
two. Republicans and the body at
Washington wculd count them in.

The Atlanta (Ga.) Constitution says
about trusts: "The cotton-oil trust
gives the latest exhibition of internal
weakness, it was about . to fall to
pieces when the leading certificate hol
ders got together, and, to use their
own picturesque language, proceeded
to 'pump the water' out of the concern.
In a total capitalization of $42,000,
000 it was found necessary to pump
out $21,000,000 of water; but even
tii is heroic treatment doesn't seem to
have helped the affair. Its disease is a
complication of which dropsy was only
an element."
The November TJni versity Magazine
contains an " exceedingly interesting
article on the life and labors of the
late Prof. Graves. It is from the facile
pen of Prof. Geo. T. Winston, his
friend and schoolmate.
The centennial eHtion of the Fay
etteville Observer is a valuable history
of that great event. It contains about
125 engravings and, altogether, U the
most creditable paper ever issued by a
North Carolina publisher.
The Richmond State thinks that ex.
President Davis' fine letter to the
Fayetteville Centennial "ives evi
dence in every line that it sprang
from a brain still vigorous in old age
and rich in the accumulated learning
of many years.

Col. Cowles didn't vote for Mr. Car
isle for Speaker. He voted for Ames
L Cummings, Jr. This was done in
retaliation for Mr. Carlisle's refusal to
allow the Cowles bill for the re
peal of the tobacco tax to be consider
ed last year. The gallaut Colonel
from the "State of Wilkes" did ex
actly right.
Hiram Lester, now an inmate of the

thought to be the oldest man in the
woild. His age is 120 years. Col.
Sloar, of McDonough, who is pver SO
years of age, says when he was a boy
Lester was an old man. Lester s teeth
are perfectly sound and his eyesight
and hearing are good. His skin is

He eats and sleeps well, and says he

Hon. Johu S. Wise arrived in New

of two weeks in Virginia. He told the
fnllnwinc storv. which he heard in
" o J '
Washington :
"It was at a cabinet meeting just
after the recent elections, said Mr.
Wise, "and Uncle Jerrv Kusk came
in late.
" 'Hello, here comes the tail of the
cabinet,' remarked Mr. Blaine, face
tiouslv.
"'Is that so?' replied Uncle Jerry,
as he chewed nervously on a rye

not vote for a R. R. Commission bill.
...It appears that the students of
Wake Forest College are an usually

of them crops out the wrong way,
and it becomes necessary for the col

were contributed entirely by work

Tracy, Secretary of War, shows that
with the completion of the vessels
authorized by- Congress the United
States will have but forty-two mod

compared with, those of other mara
time nations. He recommends the
building of two fleets of armored battle-ships,

vessels-for the Pacific coast; also the
elevation of the personnel of the en

militia Secretary of the interior Jno.
