Want Murine Kept.
Washington, Dec. 12. A movement
is being considered by several mem
bers of the house looking to the over
throw of the recent order of the pres
ident withdrawing the marine corps
from United States warships. Just
what, form the opposition to the pres
ident's order will take has not been
decided upon, but one prominent mem
ber yesterday declared that if the na
val committee did not take some step
to defend the marine corps, there prob
ably would be a provision offered on
the floor of the house expressing the
disapproval of that body of the pres
ident's policy.
gress. It can be Justly said, I think,
that these expressions were unfortun
ate. Whether it is enough to Bay this,
or whether some more formal action
ohould be taken "will be for congress,
exercising wise and discreet judgment,
to decide."

GET CANNON GOAT
Is the Slogan of 25 Republican Mem
bers of the House Who Hold
Meeting.
WANT THE RULES CHANGED
sired amendments to the rules and re
port at a meeting which will be held
next Tuesday night. It is expected
that, at this meeting there will be at
least 50 republican congressmen.
The discussion, was free. It did not
crystalize opposition upon any particu
lar rule. It was the concensus of opin
ion t,hat the rules must be materially
changed. The. power of the speaker
must be ' curbed. Changes must be
made which will permit members to
have more control over the business of
the house. "Whether this is to be ac
complished by taking out of the speak
er's hands the appointment of commit
tees, ljy substituting a steering com
mittee, elected by the majority, for
the rules committee, appointed by the
speaker, or by amending the rules, it
was unanimously agreed that present
conditions are unbearable.
With Democrat May Control.
In the present house 27 republican
members, voting with the solid demo
cratic membership, can control. In the
next house, 25 republican members,
united with the democrats, can amend
the rules.
There is an intimation that a revolt
may develop upon the floor of the
house this session unless Speaker Can
non is more responsive to the wishes
of the republican members. The mere
suggestion of such a possibility may
be sufficient to cause the "czar of the
house" to yield. He Is now In a con
ciliatory mood. His wings seem to be
clipped. .To retain the speakership, he
may be willing to compromise with the
opponent j of the present rules.

(Special Correspondence of The Argus.)
Washington, Dec. 10.-r-Waterways!
Railroad rates! ,
These are to be the watchwords of
this session of congress. They are the
biggest questions before the American
people today, and neither will await
longer for solution. ..
Wall street is right now discussing
with frenzied anxiety the probable
legislative action of congress relative
to ratlrpads.
The average citizen doesn't feel per
sonally .interested yet But he will.
Railroad rates affect him' more than
either shippers or manufacturers. In
the end the consumer pays all freight
rates. . ' . :
Waterways and railroad rates are
subjects intimately connected. It is

in proportion' to the number of water

- The railroad ' rate problem, particu
larly, 'is of the most puzzling charac
ter imaginable, not only to the aver
age newspaper, reader,, but to the fore
most rate sfudfent of the, country. ,.
Here is a sample question in, rate
arithmetic: - . . .' . .. .
tain i rate, does that signify a higher "met competition" at the gulf, the
rate for 'a shorter haul New York to Mississippi river was a' bee hive of
Salt Lake City; is. unreasonable?
The interstate commerce commission
has in the-past justified the "higher
rate for a shorter haul," granting that
a railroad has a right to "meet com
petition," which in the cited instance,
would be a boat haul from New York
around South America to San Fran
cisco. - . ... '
. ; Competition by Water Count.
How does this ruling work out? For
the haul of over 800 miles between St.
Louis and the gulf the Illinois Cen
tral's first class fre&ht rate is 90 cents
per. 100 pounds. For the 270 miles
haul between St. Louis and Selma,
Tenn., the rate i9 also 90 cents. The
railroad, justifies itself on the. ground
of ; Mississippi river steamboat com
petition between St. Louis and the
gulf, which it does not have between
St. Louis an l Selma, and inland town.
Now, what about the steamboat
traffic?, Before the Illinois Central
steamboat industry. Today nearly
v,
every steamboat line has disappeared.

it exacts the same rate from all ship
