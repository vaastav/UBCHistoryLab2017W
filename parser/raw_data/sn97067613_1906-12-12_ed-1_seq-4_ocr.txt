MORRISVILLE AND HYDE PARK
L. H.LEWIS, EDITOR
'.VLDWESDAY, DCCIMBER 12, 1906.
The dcnth of Gov. Ilcnrtce lcnves
but few of the old-time active mem
bers of the Lamoille County Bar; in
fact Col. Sawyer of Hyde Park and
Judge Powers of Morrisville are the
onl two kit of the hire and strong
membership of tliecounly bar twenty
five years ugo.
The fearless men who are naviga
ting the air with more or less success,'
say their vehicles will soon take the
place of those that move on land or
sea. Perhaps they wi'l, but seeing is
believing. Railway and other trans
portation shares no tendency to
slump oil account of the prediction.
The death of O. S. Bliss of Georgia,
Yt., will cause sincere regret on li e
part of many of the fanners of La
nioille county, who had an acquaint
ance with him. II; was inteiested
in the organization of the Vermont
Dairymen's Association and in many
ways, especially by his pen and voice,
aided in the improvement and enlight
enment of the Vermont farm and the
Vermont farmer. He will be greatly
missed at the meetings of the Assoeia
tiou.
Osage Indians do not come under
the name of " the poor Indian." Each
member of the tribe will be worth at
least $50,000 in land and annuities
with the allotments they are now
takin Indian Territory, making
them the richest Indiansin theUnited
States. Alaska will henceforth have
a voice (though not a vote) in the
Congress of the United States. The
new representative of the territory,
Frank H. Uaskey, was presented in
the House last week and sworn in.
The appearance of a delegate from
that far away portion of the nation
al domain elicited great applause
from the members.
Heartiest congratulations to Col.
G. Benedict, senior editor of the Bur
lington Free Press, who on Monday
last reached the grand age of SO
years." Nomanhasseenmorechangcs
and improvements in theart of print
ing, a newspaper : than he, and no
man has been identified with the
pres3 of Vermont a longer period, and
no man has done more with his pen
for the good of the state. With
the press of the entire state we
join most heartily in wishing the
grand old editor many more years
of life, and we trust they will be filled
with the happiness that a long life
of usefulness is worthy of.
Mark Twain is crushed again.
Anothet New England public library
has, more or less contumeliously
" t'run out " one of his books. This
time it is the library at Worcester,
Mass., and the book is "Eve's
Diary," which contains fifty or more
etchings of Eve in the costume which
prevailed at the time of her residence
in the garden of Eden. The librarian,
a "respectable married lady," looked
the book through and through, and
was horror-stricken at the pictures.
She showed them to the trustees, who
are men, and they agreed with her;
so out goes another of the Twain
books. This time, howevei , it is the
pictures and not the subject-matter,
so Uncle Mark needn't feel so bad as
in the case of" Huckleberry Finn."
8 jTh$ .Japanese question, tfrqariL
upon at some length in
message, and wnich
i the YresufetjS
has become a
"question" because of the refusal of
certain San Francisco schools to ad
mit Japanese pupils, caused a great
deal of discussion in Congress at the
opening of the session, and indeed it
should. TheCalifornians, if they are
so deathly afraid of the Japs, may
send them along east, where we will
guatantee to get along with them
and make useful citizens of them.
We have but little sympathy with
California's perennial nightmare over
the "yellow peril," because there's no
peril to it. We would gladly trade
off some of our Rutheniums, Czechs.
Libyans, Dalmatians, Serbs and
other outlandish people, dumped into
our eastern ports, for a few smart,
quick, alert, up-to-date Japs That's
how we feel about it.
CHRISTMAS SHOPPING. . !
The wise Huli. lav buyer does not
wait until just before Christmas to
make purchases of articles for pres.
cnts. He begins early, when the
shelves are full, the variety complete,
and there is no rush and hurry on
the part of both buyer and seller.
He has, in fact, already begun, and
will be well through with the work
before some others get awake to the
fact that Christmas is coming.
The loyal citizen always docs his
holiday trading at home. He would
do this, even if it were done at some
disadvantage, but it is really to bis
own advantage, as well as to the
home dealer, that he makes his pur
chases here. ,IIe saves time and
money by trading at home, and in
the vast majority of instances he is
better suited with his purchases, with
the piivilege of change if for any rea
son that is desirable, than if he trans
acted his trading by mail or went
to the city. Besides.it is only fair
to home merchants, who help b.ar
the public burdens, who a.c public
spirited and ready to aid every
worthy cause, to give them the full
measure of tfie home Holiday trade.
Thus one assists another and each
work for the go jd of all. -
Before starting in on your Holiday
advertising you would do well to
consult the ad vertising columns of the
Ni;vs and Citizen, which contain a
complete Holiday directory. Our
advertisers are men of standing and
responsibility in the community, and
their statements are to be relied upon
as absolutely correct.
Why the Longevity of Our Ex-Governors?
The death of ex-Gov. Hendee again
breaks the chain of Vermont's long
line of living ex-Goveriiors, of whom,
prior to his death, there were fifteen,
a larger number by more than double
those of any other state in the Union.
Can this fact be accounted for upon
any other theory than that Vermont'
calls to the Executi vechair a class of
men, the calm serenity of whose pri
vate lives, as a whole, is a little su
perior to those of her sister states ?
The pure water which flows down
our mountain sines, tn pure air
which is the proverbial possession of
our mountain state, may account in
part for the superior longevity of out
Vermont Governors, but may it not
be true that the public men of other
states live faster than those ot Ver
io jnt ? Far be it from us to speak dis
respect 'tillyoF thc Executives of our
sister states; but we are confronted
with a fact and not a theory, and it
seems to us that that fact is worthy
of consideration.
One state has only one living ex
Governor and we believe that no
state except Vermont has more than
seven, and that we should have four
teen it seems to us warrants some
thing more than a passing comment.
Does it not speak volumes for the up
rightness, safnity, temperance and
puiity of the men which Vermont
calls to occupy the Executive chair?
Think over the list from Holbrook of
'62 to Proctor of '06 and see if you
re-call the names of any who do not
measure up to a high standard in
these particulars; and is it not' to
this fact that we largely owe our su
periority in the matter of the longev
ity of our ex Governors ? And if this
is so, does not the fact constitute an
object lesson well worth emphasizing?

O
OUR WEEKLY Jill LETTER
Washington, D. C,
Dec. 8, 1000,
Dear Nchlihors ;
Usually on top of Thanksgiving
comes the President's message, his
annual instructions and advice to
Congress, and by that sin you know
hat the lid is off and Congress is
"off." The message came in Tuesday
last, the second day of the session
and in length and number of subjects
treated it breaks all records. Of
course there are some who don't en
dorse it all among the members of
both houses, but as to that, there are
some who don't wholly agree with
the Sermon on the Mount, so, it
seems, neither human nor divine can
please everybody. But the vast ma
joiity of both Democrats and Repub
licans are pretty thoroughly in ac
cord with its essen'ial suggestions.
Each member of the two houses was
given a ropy of the message as the
respective clerks began to read it, hut
the reading occupied over two and
one half hours and many of the Sen
ators and members of the House i e
came weary with attentive listening
and wandered out long before ihe
reading wis concluded.
The California delegation in the
House has been up in arms ever since
because of the President's language
on the Japanese question, but it is
altogether likely that the ebullition
will simmer down and that peace
and harmony will continue to pre
vail. All ihe talk of war with Japan
or that California will eecede from
the Union and set up an ana foreign
government is of course only the idle
hot air of the hour.
In many years of attendance I do
not remember to have seen as full an
attendanceof members ofboth houses
as there was Monday. Though the
proceedings were very brief and unin
teresting, yet the galleries were
packed with visitors to, the doors
long before high noon when in the
absence of a previous resolution to
the contrary both houses' met and
hundreds who were disappointed in
not being ab e to obtain seats wan-
('ered aimlessly around the corridors
and asked questions. Ot these latter,
move a little later. As to the galler
ies, the arrangements are the same
in both the House and Senate. Im
mediately behind and over the Vice
President and Speaker is the press
gallery, for seeing and hearing, the
most eligible of all Admis sion to
this is only given jointly by the pre
siding officer of each house to the
accredited Washington correspond
ent of the newspapers of thiscountry
and Europe, and the admission holds
good while the correspondent acts in
the capacity in which he was admit
ted. It goes without saying that
the " press boys " here are the flo wrtft
and pick of the world's journalism, !
many of them bearing names well
known herever the English lan-1
guage is read and spoken.
Beside this gallery thare are two
"card galleries '' admission to which
is only by the official card of a Sena
tor or member of the House, issued
by him to any friend. Then there
are two men's galleries, a ladies' gal
lery and in the Senate a Senators'
gallery and in the House a member's
gallery. There is no admission to
any one of these except to those
who are personally introduced by a
Senator or Member. Finally, there
is the diplomatic gallery in each
House reserved rigidly for member
attaches of foreign legations. Usu
ally these galleries are vacant, and
hardly ever occupied by more than
two or three ultra distinguished vis
itors. The foreigners appear to take
very little interest in our system of
lawmaking.
I will add that one half of the front
row in the Senator's and Member's
gallery is strictly and al ways reserved
for the family of the President. As
for the President himself, he is the
one man in the wide world Jwho, by
an unwritten law, cannot look at
either house in sesson. Bythe same
unwritten law he cannot enter the
Capitol except once a year. He is
expected in his room in the rear of

the Senate just one-half hour before
Congress adjourns. Otherwise, if
not sigii"d before adjournment, they
would fail.' It would require too
much time to send them to the VYIiitt
House and get them buck therefore,
for this purpose and on this (ktumou
only, he must be on the spot. The
President's ro in is always open in
charge ot fin attendant, and visitors
inspect it at their pleasure.

and Mrs. Longs worth are rccn sum

As a matter of fact, Congressman
"Nick." Lot:gworih, also known as
"Alice's husband," is apparently the
chief attraction to House visitors,
possibly distracting the speaker in
popular interest and distancing such
statesmen as Pavne, i) .-ilzcll,, Little

tion of the directors of all three of the
penal institutions Industrial School,
Work House and State's Prison, the
board of three to have entire supervis

Ex-Qov. George VV. Hendee
Rutland News
In the death of ex-Governor and ex-
Congressman George W. Hendee, of
Morrisville, there has passed one of Ver
mont's strong men, who has ocenpied
public positiou of varied character al
ways with distinction, and who has
been widely interested in the important
bnsiuesa enterprises. As railroad pro
motor, banker, and manufacturer he
occupied a conspicuous place in the
business world, while bis comprenen
sive in terest in DUblic affairs is indicated
by the fact that he was successively
superintendent of town schools, a town
representative, county state's attorney,
lieulenant-governer, governor ana mem
ber of congress.
Morrisville Messenger
In the death of ex-Gov. George W.
Hendee, Morrisville loses her first citi
zen. A generous, kindly, manly man
he was, who In the long period of his
activities filled many places of trust and
responsibility to the purpose of their
bent uses, were tbey large or stnall.t He
was a neighbor according to the'Matfters
definition; he was a friund 'ftfter-tlie
biehest tyres of friendship; '-he: wis a.
supporter of everything that broadened,1)
strengthened, or bettered tne Iitearonna
mm; he was the enemy of no man. He
was beloved by all in his manhood and
revered by all in his old age. In the
fullness of years he has laid down his
burden with all who knew him as the
legatees of bis Lenimiitv without pref
erence, rank or distinction. In that
lies his first citizenship and the unquali
tied blessing of bis memory.
