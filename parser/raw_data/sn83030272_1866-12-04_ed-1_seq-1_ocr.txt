In a time of profound taee, and prist rul

cially, especially In this part ol the 1'iov

In so far that they set at dt-flaneo the sov

and blood cbaracter.ed by thn very wan

It Is alleged by the Crown, In substance,
that at thn limn these offences stem commit

ters not In the present caso whether tho
proceeding amounted to a direct aud actual
levying of war, or whether It was so con
structively. Kither would bo sulllelent for
tho purpose of finding a true bill in any
casn where the party charged Is proved to
have been present, aiding or abetting. In
onlcr to coiistltutn a levying of war, tho
number of persons assembled is not
material. Threu or four will consti
