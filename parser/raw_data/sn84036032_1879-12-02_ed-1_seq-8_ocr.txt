VANITY FAIR.
When you see evidences of hair on the lap
pel of a young man's coat, and the concave
side of his sleeve worn thread-bare, it is tol
erably safe to conclude that he has been bug
ging something more than a delusion.— Keo
kuk Gate City.
Falstaff asked, " What is honor ?" Any
woman who attends church to-morrow and
sits behind another woman, will tell what's
on her in less than two minutes.— Republican,
The minister who denounces gambling will
smilingly accept a donation from a gambler
and ask no questions.— N. Y. Star.
The tenor shrieks, like greaseless wheel
Loud whangs the tuneless Uddle,
Your tortured nerves distinctly squirm
Like live eels on a griddle :
While horid voices pitched in alt,
Through hackneyed ballads wading
Convulse the fibres of your brain,
And this is serenading.

Miscellaneous Telegrams.
New Orleans, Nov. 25. —Rev. Jeremiah
Blackstone, colored, to-day contradicted Ber
nard Williams' statement that he and others
were paid live hundred dollars bv Kellogg,
but said he was offered fifteen hundred dollars
in behalf of Spofibrd's interest if he would
furnish information to oust Kellogg. He
made a general denial of all statements made
in this investigation respecting himself.
John Vigil's testified that Bernard Williams
had a bad reputation ; nobody who knew him
would believe his oath. Four other witnesses
testified to the same effect.
Washington, Nov. 25. —At the Cabinet
meeting this afternoon the President read to
his constitutional advisers the principal por
tion of his completed annual message. It has
been prepared after a thorough consideration
of its topics at a previous session of the Cabi
net. and there is understood to be entire
unanimity amo.ig the President's counselors
concerning its contents. The subject of the
District of Columbia Commissionersbip,
which becomes vacant by the resignation of
Capt. Phelps on the first prox., was mentioned
to-day, but no action was taken.
The President will leave Washington to
morrow morning to attend the Methodist
Episcopal fair at Philadelphia.
They Couldn't Make Him Speak.
They had a dime supper in the neighbor
hood of Pawtucket, which was gotten up by
the ladies. The conditions of the novel
supper were these : For every word spoken
by the geutlemen at the table a forfeit of ten
cents was imposed; but, on the other hand, it
was agreed that whoever could weather the
whole supper, submitting to all queries, sur
prises, and ingenious questions without re
plying, should be entitled to it gratuitously.
Many aud frequent were the artifices ami sub
terfuges resorted to by the ladies in attendance
to entrap the unguarded, aud one after another
stout and discreet man went down before the
constant volley of artful interrogations. At
last all fell out and paid the dime penally
save one individual—a queer chap whom no
body seemed to know. He attended strictly
to business, aud passed unheeded the jokes,
gibes aud challenges. They quizzed him. but
all in vain. He wrestled witli the turkey and
grappled with a goose. He bailed out the
cranberry sauce with an unswerving hand,
and he ate celery as the scriptural vegetarian
ate grass, and finally, when he had finished
his fifth piece of pie, he wipped out a pocket
slate and wrote on it, in a large amt legible
hand, "l am deaf and dumb."
