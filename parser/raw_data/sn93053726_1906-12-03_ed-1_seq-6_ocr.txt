FURS ! For Women and Children
Ton can have perfect confidence In anything you buy here in
the fur line that It will wear well, and is of the most proper style.
We've made this fur business a study, and we feel Justified in say
ing that better furs, at like prices, are not to be had.
There is always a big demand for this class of goods at Christ
mas tlmei and if you have an idea of buying something of this kind
we advise you to pick it out now, as you'll find better assortments
than will be possible three weeks hence. If you don't wish to pay
for it just now, we'll hold it for you by your paying a deposit on
it -, ; ;
Another strong point to consider: The first lot of furs received
In a season are always better than those we have to order later.
They're better furs and better made, so there is a big advantage in
picking from the first lot. '

ton, speaking of his American tour,
said: "A visit of some weeks' duration
to the United States, wherein I, had
the opportunity of inspecting great
American manufactories and of exam
ining In detail the progress of Ameri
can industry, convinces me that the
British public has no idea of the kind
of prosperity the United States Is en-
Joying today. It is no exaggeration to
state that at no previous period In hu
man history bss such prosperity been
known In any country. Every one in
America is making money piles of it"

the work the government was seeking
to do In bringing about an amicable
adjustment of the entire queafton He
very strongly urged the California rep
resentative not to introduce any meas
ure at this time which would either
tend to Inflame the Callfornlan mind
or excite any further antipathy on the
part of the Japanese. It Is understood
that Mr, Hayes will not introduce his
resolution out of deference to the
wishes of the president Mr. Hayes,
however, talked freely about the Jap
anese situation on the Pacific slope.
"I do not think that we will have
trouble with the Japanese over -this
school question at this time," he said,
"but we will have war with that coun

got It into their heads that they will
control the Pacific and we have got It
Into our heads that we will control It.
