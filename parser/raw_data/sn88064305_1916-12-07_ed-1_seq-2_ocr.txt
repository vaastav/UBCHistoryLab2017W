Co-Operaltion the Battle Cry.
A communication from W. H.
Sullivan of Iogalusa was read to
the body of Parish Fair Direc
tors in session Dec. 5th, in which
Mr. Sullivan's generous attitude
towards the fair was recognized.
He stated that while Bogalusa
would like to have the fair and
believed they could make a great
success and a big 'fair of it in
every sense of the term, still he
would not under any condition
make a fight for it. That how
ever anxious they might be to
have the fair, it would be only
thru the unanimous action of the
directors that they would ac
cept the transfer. Further
than this, Mr. Sullivan said that
in case the directors selected
Franklinton for the location he
was ready, as he has ever been
in the ;past, to co-olperate and
lend his best efforts towards
making it a success. To those
who realize what Mr. Sullivan's
generous assistance has meant
to the fair in the lpast this prom
ise of co-operation is very sig
nificant and with all forces thru
out the parish working together
to make the 1917 Fair just what
we are capable of making it. we
prophesy now that it will be sec
ond to none of any parish.
Silos For Chickens.
School teachers are always
startig something new. Perhaps
that is why they are school teach
ers. One school teacher who
lives in Upper Peninsula of Mich
igan deserves to be thanked by
the lumbermen for the possible
market for lumber that he has
opened up by the application of
the soil to the holding of green
food for chickens. This school
teacher in a farm journal, c acne
across an account of the food
Value of silage for cows, when
the idea of building a silo to pro
vide green food for chickens in
the winter time flashed across his
mind. He at once built a silo
3 1-2 feet in diameter and 8 feet
high, placing it 3 1-2 feet in the
gR-onnd. As is known by anyone
who has had anything to do with
chickens, nothing else makes
them lay so' well in the winter
time as the green food. Conse
quently the chliikei silo expert
stored the silo with lawn clippings
and sweet corn cut green. Last
winter the chickens were fed on
this ensilage and as a consequence
lhid a very satisfactory number
of eggs.
If the lunibermen will get out
and help this movement along no
doubt it wil be possible to de
velop a market for a considerable
amount of short lumber that now
is difficult of sale. It is not nec
essary that a silo be round; it
may be any shape, provided it is
air tight. When the number of
people that raise chickens are
considered it is easy to see that
the use of a silo for storing green
chicken food will call for the
utilization of considerable
amounts of Inmber yearly.

that in one hour after making

greatly. Though every aid and

she neverireceived any perma.

was the daughter of a family of
six girls and one boy. On March

this union were given five child

which Mr. Dolpho is the young

of these reach woman and man

CONGRESSIONAL
COMMITTEE BEGINS
RAILWAY INQUIRY
Proposed by President to Bet
ter Condition of Carriers.
MAY CHANGE PRESENT SYSTEM
OfficPiats do Rads Prepared to Advocate
Federal Incorporation, Supervision of
Securities and Extension of Authority
Of Interstate Commerce CommissIon.
Washington, Nov. 20.-Ten members
Qf Congress, five Senators and five
letnbers of the House of RIepresenta
* es, began here today an inquiry into
the subject. of public control and su
jervison of railroads that may lead to
the rbvolutlonizlng of the whole scheme
of governmrntal regulationm of the coun
try's transportation lines. Incidentally
fhe committee is to look into the ques
tion of government ownership of rail
WUs, telephone and telegraph lines
and express companies.
The members of thire committee
which will conduct this important in
%etigation are Senator Newlands of
Nevada, chairman; Senators Robinson
of Arkansas, Underwood of Alabama,
Cummins of Iowa and Brandegee of
Connectlcut, and Rlepresentntives Ad
Amson of Georgia, Sims of Tennessee,
Cullop of Indiana, Easch of Wisconsin
and Hamilton of Michigan. The in
quiry was recommended by President
Wilson th his message to Congress in
December of last year. He described
as its purpose to determine what could
be done "for bettering the conditions
under which the railroads are operated
and for making them more useful serv
ants of the country as a whole."
Prominent Men as Witnesses.
In order to obtain the views of a!
interests affected by the operations of
the transportation lines the conunittee
has invited prominent shippers, hank
ers, representatives of commercial or
ganizations, railway executives, econo
mists and others to appear before them.
The first to be heard are railroad
commissioners of various states who
began their evidence today. Their
testimony is directed chiefly to oppos
ing any enlargement of the federal
authority over commerce that would
detract from the powers now exercised
by state bodies. They will be followed
shortly by officials of railway labor
organizations who are expected to reg
ister their opposition to the Increase
of governmental authority over wages
and conditions of labor.
Chief interest in the hearings cen
ters in the proposals that will be put
forward by representatives of the ral
roads, for it is reported that they will
advocate an extension of federal au
thority over rates and securities to the
practical exclusion of state control of
these matters. It is understood also that
they will go on record in favor of fed
eral incorporation of all railroad lines.
Legislative Program of Railroads.
From an authoritative source is ob
tained the following outline of the leg
islative program which the railroads
will ask the committee to consider in
its investigation: They will endeavor
to demonstrate to the commission that
one of the principal defects in the pres
ent system of railroad regulation is
the lack of coordinationjesulting from
the simultaneous and conflicting regu
lation by the federal government and
by the 48 states. They will, therefore,
ask that entire governmental control
of the rates and practices of interstate
carriers, except purely local matters,
be placed in the hands ef a federal
body so that interstate tra.e may be
regulated without reference tm state
lines, leaving to the state commissions
jurisdiction only over local matters and
local public utilities. As a part of this
plan, a compulsory system of federal
incorporation is to be recommended,
accompanied by federal supervision of
railroad stock and bond issiues.
A reorganization of the Interstate
Commerce Commission will be asked,
in order to enable the commission prop
erly to exercise its increased powers.
It is also proposed that the preparation
and prosecution of eases agalnst the
railroads shall be delegated to some
other agency of the government, possi
bly the Department of Justice, so that
the commiislion may devote its ener
gLes to its administrative functions.
With the commission thus relieved
of some of its present duties and equip
ped to handle its business more prompt
ly, the railroads will urge that the pe
riod during which the commission may
now suspend proposed increases in
rates be reduced from ten months to
60 days, with provision for reparation
to be paid to the shippers if the ad
vance shall be declared unreasonable.
The will also ask that the commis
sion be given th6 power to prescribe
minimum ae well as maximum rates
so that In meeting Complaints of dis
crimination the commission may order
the avaace ot a rate which it ConeId
