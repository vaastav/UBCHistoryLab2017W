FOR 8ALE BY
Association directors anil Chamber ot
Commerce trustees a cablegram was
authorized to be sent K. M. Hatch, the
Chamber's Washington rcpresentatUe,
to the effect that the commercial
Miodlcs are ready to send on a commit-
tco or business men to work for the
materialization of the President's rec
ommendations to Congress that this
Territory bo shon, for, say, twenty
years, 70 per cent of the Internal re
emie and uistoms receipts for fortifi
cations and Imprcnements.
It was understood that the cable
should ask of Hatch whether the plan

SWANZY HEADS CONSERVATIVE LIST
As the only result of the JolnUmcet- Ington as Mr. Hatch to urge any claims
Ins yesterday afternoon of Merchants'! we may have. If Mr. Hatch feels that
he requires assistance, that will b
glcn him. If he feels that more In
fluence may be brought to bear by a
committee from here, then I say let
Bitch a committee go forward, Tho
Milue of such a committee would time
to depend upon Its personnel. Wo
would not want to send any man along
who lould not engage the attention ot
Congress.
"Therefore I would suggest that be
fore an j tiling be done In the wny of
dieting men to go; forwnrd, that Mr.
Hatch, the aicrvdlted rcprescntntUc of
the Chamber of Commerce, be asked It
he uteris any help In this matter, and

might have been expected of a gather
Ingiiallcd to baik proposed benefits
for all. The question whether Mr. K.
M. Hatch would approve ot the move
vns raised and It was also suggested
that the President might resent the
action as In the nature of Interference.
Strange to say It was possible for the
Chamber of Commeric to tnko this ser
iously, rather than as a huge joke.
Oeo.W. Smith, president of tho .Mer
chants' Association, presided, at tho
suggestion of K. J. Lourey, president
of tho Chamber. Smith stated tho
meeting's object, remarking that the
recommendations for Hawaii had first
been made by the Governor and then
by the President to Congress. He was
heartily In favor of sending a bust-
lout. It would be ueiessary for suih a
tommlltco to rcjualn in Washington,
