ii (he Situation.
Manila, Dec. 1. Insurgent leaders in
1he northern portion of Luzon may
surrender to the Americans to-day.
(ien. Lawton, who is in Uainbang, teven
miles from Unyombong, in the t'agayan
valley, lias been in telegraphic com
munication with the insurgent com
manders over the wires which were still
in their possession. The leaders of the
rebels arc considering the proposition
which (Jen. Lawton lias made by tele
graph for their surrender, lie demands
an unconditional surrender, but prom
ises that the rebels will not be punislied
for treason with the death penalty. It
is expected that the insurgents, who
realize that they can oH'er resistance
but a short time longer, will accept and
lay down their arms.
Locution of Our Force.
Gen. MacArthur is now in llayam
bang (or Uayamban); preparing to
sweep the country on both sides of
the Manlla-Pagupan railroad. (Ien.
Wheaton is at San Fabian and ("Jen.
Lawton at Tavuir. The cordon
from
San Fabian to San Isidro covers
njj
the roads and occupies all the towns
on the line. The American policy Is
to prevent any more insurgents es
caping to the north and to force them
toward the country west of the rail
road. Notable l'rlnoiu'm.
Maj. Johnston, of (ien. MacArthur's
staff, brought here by special train
Churibian, secretary of the treasury iu
the so-called Filipino government, and
Mariana Lin (Jap, a Chinese half

Washington, Dec. 2. Considerable
interest is felt here in the news that the
insurgents at llayombong have surren
dered, particularly as the number is
said to exceed that captured by the
I'nited States troops at any one time,
llayombong is the city to which Agui

Letter f rom '(ien. Wheeler.
Washington, Dec. 4. (Jen. Joe Wheel
er in a personal letter received here,
dated at Angeles, Luzon, says:
"There are more than 20 different tribes
tn this island and very few of them would
submit to Agulnaldo's rule. Aguinaldo and
his generals would like to govern, because
It would give them great power, ard many
of his soldiers like the war because for
the first time In their lives they have au
thority to carry a gun. They live by tak
ing what they want from the people. Many
of them are robbers who rob defenseless
people of their money and sometimes mur
der them. If we should withdraw there
would be warfare and anarchy in the
Islands and the well-to-do people would
get some strong government to come and
take control.
"Aguinaldo publishes a paper, which Is
filled with expressions from people of the
United States who are called antl-lmpe-rlalists,
and I think were It not for these
expressions the Insurrection would be
closed."

tract from IIIm Report.
' Washington, Dec. 2. The annual report

i while summing up the work In all the bu
, reaus. Is of special Interest by reason of
Its statements regarding pension policies.
' At the close of the tlscal year there were
S91.51! pensioners, a decrease of 2.193 dur
' lng the year. The average annual value

Secretary Hitchcock urges legislation to
definitely construe the act of June 27,
relating to widows' pensions. Regarding
I this he says: "In order to more exactly de
fine the words 'means of support' I approve
the recommendation of the commissioner
of pensions that the act of June 27. ISiO. be
I so amended that a pensionable status be
', granted to widows whose income, lndc
' pendent of the proceeds of their dally labor,
: is not in excess of $250 per annum." The
, report also recommends legislative author
ity for biennial examinations of penslon
I ers: legislation prohibiting the payment of
j "any compensation whatever to pension at
torneys and agents for any service In con-
nection with any claim or proceeding un
I der the pension laws, except such as may
within certain limits fixed by congress be
1 allowed by the commissioner of pensions
i and paid from the pension money as now
provided with respect to 'claims for pen
i sion," and for the delivery free of any
I part paid letter or packet addressed to pen
sion agencies.
' During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1??9,
the public lands disposed of aggregated
9.1S2.413.1G acres.
The total cash receipts during the year
I amounted to J3.070.137.34, an increase of
I 1792.142.16.
The total area of public lands is approxl
I mately fixed at 1.082.138.221 acres, of which
029,308,008 acres are undisposed of and 132,
SSJ,133 acres have been reserved for va
i rlous nurnoses.

could be applied to letters without entail

Our ev 1'iiMMenMloiiN.
Regarding our new possessions the post
master general says: "The presence of
United States troops In the new island pos
sessions and Cuba, In constant communi
cation with home, constrained the estab
lishment of mail facilities for their needs
and the practical obliteration of the old
local postal system with the extinguish
ment of Spanish authority compelled a re
construction of the whole service for the
requirements of the native population."
Iturul Free Delivery.
"The free delivery of malls In the rural
districts has proved to be one of the most
important among recent developments of
the postal service, and presents In Its pes
slbilities a question of the largest propor
tions. The results already attained have
been of a significant character, and the
practical evidences bearing upon the feasi
bility of the system, upon the degree of its
self-support and upon the effect and the
sentiment In the communities where It has
been tried, deserve the most careful consid
eration. How far the system shall be ex
tended Is submitted for the determination
of congress, with a full presentation of
facts upon which to base a Conclusion. This
service has been called 'experimental In
each appropriation made by congress for
Its continuance. It Is the opinion of the
officers having It In charge that the experi
mental stage has been passed, and in their
view I coincide. The appropriation for
rural free delivery service for the present
fiscal year was increased from $150,000 to
$300,000, and this amount will be practically
absorbed by the contlnuarce to the erd
of the fiscal yeer of the service already es
tablished. It Is now In successful operation
from 300 distributing points, scattered
among 40 states and one territory (the only
states unrepresented In the list being Ida
ho, Mississippi, Montana and Wyoming),
giving service to 179,131 people, at an aver
age annual cost of S4 cents per capita.
"The benefits accruing from the exten
sion of postal facilities to the rural com
munities may be summarized as follows:
Increased postal receipts, making many
of the new deliveries almost immediately
self-supporting; enhancement of the value
of farm lands reached by this service and
better prices obtained for farm products
through more direct communication with
the markets and prompter information of
their state: Improved means of travel,
some hundreds of miles of country roads,
especially In the western states, having
been graded specifically In order to obtain
rural delivery: higher educational Influ
ences, broader circulation of the means of
public Intelligence ar.d closer dally con
tact with the great world of activity ex
tended to the homes of heretofore isolated
rural communities."
OTIS REVIEWS THE WAR.
Commander of the American Force
IteportB on Operations In the
Philippines.
Washington, Dec. 4. The report of
Gen. Otis on operations in the Philip
pines up to August 31 last has been
made public by the war department. It
is a volume of 273 pages, with an ap
pendix of minor reports almost as large.
The report is a chronological recapitu
lation of events in the islands since Gen.
Otis took command. One of the most
interesting features is the immense
amount of detail involved in Gen. Otis
administration of the affairs of the is
land. Gen. Otis throws some light on
his Chinese exclusion act, declaring it 8
matter of public policy. He 6ays the
step was taken to nvoid the rioting and
bloodshed that was continually breaking
out between the races. In concluding
his report Gen. Otis says that it may
prove fortunate that Aguinaldo'a in
surrection was not stamped out in
stanter upon i.ts inception. He says that
the natives have had a chance to see the
difference between American and na
tive methods of government, and IiIr
opinion is that they will gladly submit
to the former as soon as they can be
protected from the latter.

Washington, Dec. 2. The annual report'
of Klihu Hoot, secretary of war, was made
public Friday. The first half Is devoted to
the operation of the army in the Philip
pines, Cuba and Porto Uico. The report
Klves a full history of the military opera
tions In the Philippines from August 12,
IS'.kS, up to the present time. An Impor
tant feature of the report is a comprehen
sive outline of a plan of government for
l'orto Klco. It ls understood that Presi
dent McKinley ls In entire accord with Sec
retary Hoot on this question, and that the
plan outlined by the secretary will be the
identical plan which the president will rec
ommend to congress In his annual message,
(o vern Mien t for l'orto ltlco.
Concerning the plan of government pro
posed for Porto Hico, Secretary Hoot cites
the Paris treaty, which provides that con
gress shall determir. the civil rifclus and
political status of the natives of the terri
tory ctded to this government. The scheme
outlined includes a definite declaration by
congress of what American laws aro to be
made applicable to the Porto Rlcans, fol
lowing which it is recommended that a
federul Judiciary be established.
The form of insular government proposed
provides for the appointment of a governor
by the president, to be confirmed by the
senate; the chief officers of state customary
under our system, and a legislative council
to be composed of the chief officers of state
and a minority selected from the people of
the Island by the president. All acts of the
council are to be subject to the veto power
of the governor and to be passed over the
veto by a two-thirds vote. No law is to
become effective until it has remained with
out this approval for 30 days after Its pres
entation to congress or the president. It is
suggested that voting right should be lim
ited to those who read and write or who
own a small amount of property.
The secretary considers It too early to es
tablish a local legislature, giving the In
habitants the franchise only In municipal
affairs.
Military Operations.
The report cites In brief the history of the
military operations In the Philippines,
Porto Hico and Cuba during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1S03. Relief work In all three
places is dilated upon. The transport serv
ice, it 1 stated. Includes SI steam trans
ports, with a saving in work done over or
dinary commercial rates of JjOI.OuO. The re
moval of the dead from Cuba and similar
work contemplated from the Philippines is
touched upon.
Favors I.arjjer Army.
An Increased and reorganized regular
army, with many new and novel features
In. the system Involved, Is earnestly recom
mended. Radical changes, which contem
plate the betterment of the service In
every department are proposed. The
changes in the army organization and the
increase proposed are in the first instance
specified particularly, while In the second
no definite statement Is made except as
to artillery. The present artillery force is
recommended to be increased five times its
present strength. The increase In officers
and enlisted men is to be sufficient to man
tho equipment In the seacoast fortifica
tions, besides providing for the other
branches of the service.
He points to the bravery displayed by the
regular army officers during the late war
with Spain and the insurrection in the
Philippines, and insists the people have
very thoroughly learned that an army of
ficer, when he becomes such, does not cease
to bo an American citizen.
Deaths In the Army.
The regular irmy now numbers 61. iW en
