remove a source of constant Irritation
' and complaint. This is the first case
Involving such great international
questions which has been submitted to
Jthe permanent court of arbitration at
J, The Hague.
! The treaty between the United States
. and Great Britain concerning the Ca
nadian international boundary, con-
"cluded April 11, 1908, authorizes the
appointment of two commissioners to
define and mark accurately the inter
national boundary line between the
; i United States and the Dominion of
Canada in the waters of the Passama
Jquoddy bay and provides for the ex-
' change of briefs within the period of
' six months. The briefs were duly pre
iffiented within the prescribed period,
but as the commissioners failed to
agree within six months after the ex
change of the printed statements, as
'required by the treaty, it has now be-
' ficome necessary to resort to the arbl
litraticn provided for in the article.
The, international fisheries commls-
-Elon appointed pursuant to and under
;the authority of the convention of
JAprll 11, 1908, between the United
J States and Great Britain has com-
. 'pleted a system of uniform and com-
Jmon international regulations for the
'. 'protection and preservation of the food

' ,"ters of the United States and Canada.

Protecting the Seals,
j Negotiations for an International
conference to consider and reach an
arrangement providing for the preser
vation and protectiotr of the fur seals
In the" north ; Pacific are in progress
with the governments of Great Britain,
Japan and Russia. The attitude, of
,the" governraehts Interested"' leads " ine
to hope for aatlsfactory settlement of
this question as the ultimate outcome
of the negotiations.
The second peace conference recent-,
lyheld at .The. Hague adopteda con
vention ,fortte- establishment of an in
ternatlonalyprize court upon the joint
proposal of delegations of the United
States, France, Germany and Great
Britain, The law to be observed by
the tribunal in the decision of prize
cases was, however, left in an uncer
tain and therefore unsatisfactory state.
Article 7 of the convention provided
that the court was to be governed by
the provisions of treaties existing be
tween the belligerents, but that "In
the absence of such ' provisions the
court shall apply the rules' of inter
nation . law. If no .generally, recog-
wax
nized rule exists the court shall give
judgment in, accordance with the gen
eral principles of justice and equity."
As, however, many questions In Inter
national maritime law are understood
differently and therefore interpreted
differently in various countries, it was
deemed advisable, not to Intrust legis
lative powers to" the proposed court,
but to determine the rules of law prop
erly applicable lh a conference of the
representative maritime nations. Pur
suant to an invitation of Great Britain
a conference was held at London from
Dec. 2, 190S, to Feb. 23, 3909, in which
the following powers participated:
The United States, Au?trla-nungary,
France Germany.. Great Britain. Italy.
Japan, : the" ' Netherlands. "Kussia and
Spain. The conference resulted m the
declaration of London, unanimously
agreed to and signed by the participat
ing powers, concerning, among other
I matters, the highly important subjects
or Diocnaae, contra oauu, tue uesuue
tlon of neutral prizes and continuous
voyages.
The declaration of London Is an emi
nently satisfactory codification of, the
international maritime law, and It is
hoped that Its reasonableness and fair
ness will secure lt3 general adoption,
as well as remove one of the difficul
ties standing in the way of the estab
lishment of an international prize
court.
Under the authority given in the
sundry civil appropriation act, ap
proved March 4, 1909, the United
States was represented at the inter
national conference on maritime law
at Brussels. The conference met on
the 2Sth of September last and result
ed In the signature ad referendum of
a convention for the unification of cer
tain regulations with regard to mari
time assistance and salvage and a con
vention for the unification of certain
rules with regard to collisions at sea.
Two new projects of conventions
which have not heretofore been con
sidered In a diplomatic conference
namely, one concerning the limitation
of the rej ponsibility of shipowners
and the other concerning marine mort
gages and privileges have been sub
mitted by the conference to the dif
ferent governments.
The conference adjourned to meet
gain on April 11. 1910.
The international conference for the
purpose of promoting uniform legisla
tion concerning letters of exchange,
which was called by the government
of the Netherlands to meet at The
nague In September, 1909, has been
postponed to meet at that capital In
June, 1910. The United States will be
appropriately represented In this con
ference under the provision therefor
already made by conarress.
The cordial Invitation of Belgium to
be represented by a fitting display of
American progress in the useful arts
and Inventions at the world's fair to
be held at Brussels In 1910 remains to
be acted upon by the congress. Mind
ful of the advantages to accrue to our
artisans and producers in competition
with their continental rivals, I renew
the recommendation heretofore made
that provision be made for acceptance
of the invitation and adequate repre
sentation in the exposition.
REFORMS li! THE KONGO.
Attitude of the United States One ef
Benevolemt Encouragement.
The question arising out of the Bel
gian annexation of the Independent
State of the Kongo, which has so long
and earnestly preoccupied the atten
tion of this government and enlisted
the sympathy of our best citizens, is
still open, but in a more hopeful stage.
This government was among the fore
most In the great work of uplifting
the uncivilized regions of Africa and
urging the extension of the benefits of
civilization, education and fruitful
open commerce to that vast domain
and Is a party to treaty engagements
of all the Interested powers designed
to carry out that great duty to human
ity. The way to better the original
and adventitious conditions, so bur
densome to the natives and so de
structive to their development, has
been pointed out, by observation and
experience, not alone of American rep
resentatives, but by cumulative evi
dence from nil quarters and by the In
vestigations of Belgian agents. The
announced programs of reform?,
striking at many of the evlla know
to exist, are an augury of better
things. The attitude of the United
States is one of benevolent encourage
ment, coupled with a hopeful trust
that the good work, responsibly under
taken and zealously perfected to the
accomplishment of the results so
ardently desired, will soon justify the
wisdom that inspires them and satisfy
the demands of humane sentiment
throughout the world.
German Patent.
A convention between the United
States and Germany, under which the
nonworking provisions of the German
patent law are made inapplicable to
the patents of American citizens, was
concluded on Feb. 23, 1909, and Is now
in force. Negotiations for similar con
ventions looking to the placing of
American inventors on the s..' foot
ing as nationals have recently been
initiated with other European govern
ments whose laws require the local
working of foreign patents.
Under an appropriation made at the
last session of the congress a commis
sion rvas sent on American cruisers
to Mourovia to Investigate the interests
of the United States and its citizens In
Liberia. Upon its arrival at Monrovia
the commission was enthusiastically
received and during it3 stay in Li
beria was everywhere met with the
heartiest expressions of good will for
the American government and people,
and the hope was repeatedly expressed
on all sides that this government
might see its way clear to do some
thing to relieve the critical position of
the republic arising in a measure from
external as well as internal and finan
cial embarrassments.
The Liberian government afforded
every facility to the commission for
ascertaining the true state of affairs.
The commission also had conferences
with representative citizens, interest
ed foreigners and the representatives
of foreign governments In Monrovia.
Visits were made to various parts of
the republic and to the neighboring
British colony of Sierra Leone, where
the commission was received by and
conferred with the governor.
Helping Liberia.
It will be remembered that the In
terest of the United States in the re
public of Liberia springs from the his
torical fact of the foundation of the
republic by the colonization of Ameri
can citizens of the African race. In
an early treaty with Liberia there Is a
provision under which the United
States may be called upon for advice
or assistance. Pursuant to this provi
sion and in the spirit of the moral re
lationship of the United States to
Liberia that republic last year asked
this government to lend assistance in
the solution of certain of their national
problems, and hence the commission
was sent.
The report of our commissioners has
just been completed and is now under
examination by the department of
6tate. It is hoped that there may re
sult some helpful measures, in which
case it may be my duty again to invite
your attention to this subject.
The Norwegian government, by a
note addressed on Jan. 23, 1909, to the
department of state, conveyed an Invi
tation to the government of the United
States to take part in a conference
which it is understood will be held In
February or March, 1910, for the pur
pose of devising means to remedy ex
isting conditions in the Spitzbergen
islands.
This invitation was conveyed under
the reservation that the question of,
altering the status of the Islands as
countries belonging to no particular
state and as equally open to the citi
zens and subjects of all states should
not be raised.
The European powersi invited to this
conference by the government of Nor
way were Belgium, Denmark, France,
Germany, Great Britain, Russia, Swe
den and the Netherlands.
The department of state, in view of
proofs filed with it in 1906, showing
the American possession, occupation
and working of certain coal bearing
lands in Spitzbergen, accepted the in
vitation under the reservation above
stated and under the further reserva
tion that all interests in those Islands
already vested should be protected
and that there should be equality, of
ODDortunity for the future. It was
further pointed ' out that" membership
in the conference on the part of the
United States was qualified by the
consideration that this government
would not become a signatory to any
conventional arrangement concluded
by the European members of the con
ference which would imply , contribu
tory participation by the United States
in any obligation or responsibility for
the enforcement of any scheme of ad
ministration which might be devised
by the conference for the Islands.
The Nr East.
His maJesfMehmud V., sultan o2
Turkey, recently sent to this country
a special embassy to announce hia ac
cession. The quick transition of the
government of the Ottoman empire
from one of retrograde tendeneVs to a
constitutional government with a par
liament and with progressive modern
policies of reform and public improve
ment is one of the Important phenome
na of our times. Constitutional gov
ernment seems also to have made
further advance in Persia. These
events have turned the eyes of the
world upon the near east. In that
quarter the prestige of the United
States has spread widely through the
peaceful influence of American schools,
universities and missionaries. There
is every reason why we should obtain
a greater share of the commerce of the
near east since the conditions are
more favorable now than ever before,
Latin America.
One of the happiest events In recent
pan-American diplomacy was the pa
cific, Independent settlement by the
governments of Bolivia and Peru of a
boundary difference between them,
which for some weeks threatened to
cause war and even to entrain lm
bitterments affecting other republics
less directly concerned. From various
quarters, directly or indirectly con
cerned, the Intermediation of the
United States was sought to assist In
g solution of the controversy. Desir
ing at all times to abstain from any
undue mingling in the affairs of sister
republics and having faith in the abil
ity of the governments of Peru and
Bolivia themselves to settle their dif
ference in a manner satisfactory to
themselves which, viewed with mag
nanimity, would assuage all lmbitter
ment, this government steadily ab
stained from being drawn into the
controversy and was much gratified to
find its confidence justified by events.
On the 9th of July next there will
open at Buenos Aires the fourth pan
American conference. This conference
will have a special meaning to the
hearts of all Americans because
around its date are clustered the anni
versaries of the Independence of so
many of the American republics. It is
not necessary for me to remind the
congress of the political, social and
commercial importance of these gath
erings. You are asked to make liberal
appropriation for our participation. If
this be granted it is my purpose to
appoint a distinguished and representa
tive delegation qualified - fittingly to
represent this country and.to deal with 1
the problems of Intercontinental In
terest which will there be discussed.
The Argentine Republic will also
hold from May to November, 1910, at
Buenos Aires a grnt International
agricultural exhibition, in which the
United States lias been invited to par
ticipate. Considering the rapid growth
of the trade of the United States with
the Argentine Republic and the cor- j
dial relations existing between the
two nations, together with the fact that
It provides an opportunity to show def
erence to a sister republic on the oc
casion of the celebration of its national
independence, the proper departments
of this government are taking steps to
apprise the Interests concerned of the
opportunity .afforded by this exhibi
tion, in which apprepriate participa
tion by this country is so desirable.
The designation of an official repre
sentative is also receiving considera
tion. PAN-AMERICAN POLICY.
Monroe Doctrine Not For Perpetua
tion of Irresponsible Government.
Today more than ever before Amer
ican capital is seeking Investment in
foreign countries, and American prod
ucts are more and more generally seek
ing foreign markets. As a conse
quence in all countries there are Amer
ican citrtens and American interests
to be protected on occasion by their
government. These movements of men,
of capital and of commodities bring
peoples and governments closer togeth
er and so form bonds of peace and mu
tual dependency, as they must also
naturally sometimes make passing
points of friction. The resultant sit
uation inevitably Imposes upon this
government vastly increased responsi
bilities. This administration, through
the department of state and the. for
eign service, is lending all proper sup
port to legitimate and beneficial Amer
ican enterprises in foreign countries,
the degree of such support being meas
ured by the national advantages to
be expected. A citizen himself cannot
by contract or otherwise divest hlm
eelf of the right, nor can this govern
ment escape the obligation, of his pro
tection in his personal and property
rights when these are unjustly in
fringed in a foreign country. To avoid
ceaseless vexations it is proper that In
considering whether American enter
prise should be encouraged or support
ed in a particular country the govern
ment should give full weight not only
to the national as opposed to the indi
vidual benefits to accrue, but also to
the fact whether or not the govern
ment' of the country in question is in
Its administration and in its diplomacy
faithful to the principles of modera
tion, equity and justice upon which
alone depends international credit In
diplomacy as well as in finance.
The pan-American policy of this
government has long been fixed In its
principles and remains unchanged.
With the changed circumstances of the
United States and of the republics to
the south of us, most of which have
great natural resources, stable govern
ment and .progressive Ideals, the ap
prehension which gave rise to the
Monroe doctrine may be said to have
nearly disappeared, and neither the
doctrine as it exists nor any other doc
trine of American policy should be
permitted to operate for the perpetua
tion of irresponsible government, the
escape of Just obligations or the lnsidi
ous allegation of dominating ambitions
on the part of the United States.
Beside the fundamental doctrines of
our pan-American policy there have
grown up a realization of political in
terests, community of Institutions and
Ideals and a flourishing commerce. All
these bonds will be greatly strength
ened as time goes on and increased
facilities, such as the great bank soon
to be established in Latin America.
supply the means for bnilding up the
colossal intercontinental commerce of
rthe future.
My meeting with President Diaz and
the greeting exchanged on both Amer
ican and Mexlean soil served, I hope,
to signalize the close and cordial rela
tions which so well bind together this
republic and the great republic Imme
diately to the south, between which
there Is so vast a network of material
interests.
I am happy to say that all but one
of the cases which for so long vexed
our relations with Venezuela have
been settled within the past few
months and that, under the enlight
ened regime now directing the govern
ment of Venezuela, provision has been
made for arbitration of the remaining
case before The Hague tribunal.
On July 30, 1909, the government of
Panama agreed, after considerable ne
gotiation, to indemnify the relatives of
the American officers and Bailors who
were brutally treated, one of them
having. Indeed, been killed, by the
Tanaman police this year.
The sincere desire of the government
of Panama to do away with a situation
where such an accident could occur Is
manifest In the recent request in com
pliance with which this government
has lent the services of an officer of
the army to be employed by the gov
ernment of Panama as Instructor of
police.
The sanitary Improvements and pub
lic works undertaken In Cuba prior to
the present administration of that gov
ernment, in the success of which the
United States is Interested under the
treaty, are reported to be making good
progress, and since the congress pro
vided for the continuance of the recip
rocal commercial arrangement be
tween Cuba and the United States
assurance has been received that no
negotiations injuriously affecting the
situation will be undertaken without
consultation.
The collection of the customs of the
Dominican Republic through the gen
eral receiver of customs appointed bj
the president of the United States in
accordance with the convention of
Feb. 8. K.I07, has proceeded In an un
eventful and satisfactory manner. The
customs receipts have decreased owinsr
to disturbed political and economic
conditions and to a very natural cur
tailment of Imports In view of the an
ticipated revision of the Dominican
tariff schedule. The payments to the
fiscal agency fund for the service of
the bonded debt of the republic, as
provided by the convention, have been
regularly and promptly made, and sat
isfactory progress has been made In
carrying out the provisions of the con
vention looking toward the completion
of the adjustment of the debt and the
acquirement by the Dominican govern
mentof certain concessions and mo
nopolies which hava been a burden to
the commerce of the couutry. In short,
the receivership has demonstrated Its
ability, even under unfavorable eco
nomic and political conditions, to do
the work for which it was intended.
This government was obliged to In
tervene diplomatically to bring about
arbitration or settlement of the claim
of the Emery company against Nica
ragua, which it had long before been
agreed should be arbitrated. A settle
ment of this troublesome case was
reached by the signature of a protocol
on Sept 18, 1909.
Claim Against Chile.
Many years ago diplomatic interven
tion became necessary to the protec
tion of the interests in the American
claim of AIsop & Co. against the
government of Chile. The govern
ment of Chile had frequently admitted
obligation in the case and had prom
ised this government to settle it. There
had been two abortive attempts to do
so through arbitral commissions, which
failed through lack of jurisdiction.
Now, happily, as the result of the re
cent diplomatic negotiations, the gov
ernments of the United States and of
Chile, actuated by the sincere desire
to free from any strain those cordial
and friendly relations upon which both
st such store, have agreed by a proto
col to submit the controversy to defini
tive settlement by his Britannic majes
ty Edward VII.
ZELAYA GOVERilMEHT SCORED.
Slain Americans Shonld Have Eeen
Dealt With as Prisoners of War.
Since the Washington conventions of
1907 were communicate'd to the gov
ernment of the United States as a con
sulting and advising party this gov
ernment has been almost continuously
called upon by one or another and in
turn by all of the five Central Amer
ican republics to exert itself for the
maintenance of the conventions. Near
ly every complaint has been against
the Zelaya government of Nicaragua,
which has kept Central America in
constant tension or turmoil. The re
sponses made to the representations of
Central American republics as due
from the United States ou account of
its relation to the Washington conven
tions have been at all times conserva
tive and have avoided, so far as possi
ble, any semblau.-e of interference, al
though it is very 'apparent that the
considerations of geographic proximity
to the canal zone and of the very sub
stantial American Interests in Central
America give to the United States a
special position In the zone of these
republics and the Caribbean sea.
I need not rehearse here the patient
efforts of this government to promote
peace and welfare among these re
publics," efforts which are fully appre
ciated by the majority of them who
are loyal to their true Interests. It
would be no less unnecessary to re
hearse here the sad tale of unspeak
able barbarities and oppression alleged
to have been committed by the Zelaya
government. Recently two Americans
were put to death by order of Presi
dent Zelaya himself. They were offi
cers in the organized forces of a rev
olution which had continued many
weeks and was In control of about
half of the republic, and as such, ac
cording to the modern enlightened
practice of civilized nations, they were
entitled to be dealt as prisoners of war.
At the date when this message is
printed this government has termina
ted diplomatic relations with the Ze
laya government, for reasons made
public in a communication to the for
mer Nicaraguan charge d'affaires, and
is Intending to take such future steps
as may be found most consistent with
its dignity, Its duty to American Inter
ests, and its moral obligations to Cen
tral America and to civilization. It
may be necessary for me to bring this
subject to the attention of the congress
In a special message.
Bureau cf American Republics.
The international bureau of Amer
ican republics has carried on an Impor
tant and Increasing work during the
last year. In the exercise of Its pecul
iar functions as an international agen
cy, maintained by all the American
republics for the development of pan
American commerce and friendship. It
has accomplished a great practical
good which could be done In the same
way by no individual department or bu
reau of one government and is there
fore deserving of your liberal support.
The fact that It is about to enter a new
building, erected through the munifi
cence of an American philanthropist
and the contributions of all the Amer
ican nations, where both its efficiency
of administration and expense of main
tenance will naturally be much aug
mented, further entitles it to special
consideration.
OPEN DQORJN CHINA.
United States Insisting1 on Equality
of Opportunity For All Nations.
In the far east this government pre
serves unchanged its pHey of support
ing the principle of equality of oppor
tunity and scrupulous respect for the
integrity of the Chinese empire, to
which policy are pledged the Interested
powers of both east and west.
Bv the treatv of 1903 China has un
dertaken the abolition of likin with a
moderate and proportionate raising of
the customs tariff along with currency
reform. These reforms being of mani
fest advantage to foreign commerce as
well as to the interests of China, this
government is endeavoring to facili
tate these measures and the needful
acquiescence of the treaty powers.
When it appeared that Chinese likin
revenues were to be hypothecated to
foreign bankers in connection with a
great railway project it was obvious
that the governments whose nationals
held this loan would have a certain
direct interest in the question of the
carrying out by China of the reforms
in question. Because this railroad
loan represented a practical and real
application of the open door policy
through co-operation with China by
interested powers, as well as because
of its relations to the reforms l-eferred
to above, the administration deemed
American participation to be cf great
national Interest. Happily, when it
was as a matter of broad policy ur
gent that this opportunity should not
be lost, the indispensable instrumental
ity presented itself when a group of
American bankers of international
reputation and great resources agreed
at once to share in the loan upon pre
cisely such terms as this government
should approve. The chief of those
terms was that American railway ma
terial should be upon an exact equality
with that of the other nationals Join
ing in the loan In the placing of or
ders for this whole railroad system.
After months of negotiation the equal
participation of Americans'- seems at
last assured. It is gratifying that
Americans will thus take their share
In this extension of these great high
ways of trade and to believe that such
activities will give a real impetus to
our commerce and will prove a prac
tical corollary to our historic policy in
the far east.
The imperial Chinese government in
pursuance of Its decision to devote
funds from the portion of the indem
nity remitted by the United States to
the sending of students to thlj couu
try has already completed arrange
ments for carrying out this purpose,
and a considerable body of students
have arrived to take up their work in
our schools and universities. No one
can doubt the happy effect that the as
sociations formed by these reprfseuta
tive joung men will Lave when they
return to take up their work in the
progressive development of their coun
try. The results of the opium conference

forts toward the eradication of the

legislation.
In one of the Chinese-Japanese con
ventions of Sept. 4 of this year there
was. a provision which caused consid
erable public apprehension ' in that
upon its f".ce It was believed In some
quarters to seek to establish a monop
oly of mining privileges along the
South Manchurian and Antung-Muk-den
railroads and thus to exclude
Americans from a wide field of enter
prise, to take part In which they were
by treaty with China entitled. After
a thorough examination of the conven
tions and of the several contextual
documents the secretary of state reach
ed the conclusion that no such monop
oly was intended or accomplished.
However, in view of the widespread
discussion of this question, to confirm
the view it bad reached this govern
ment made . Inquiry of the imperial .
Chinese and Japanese governments
and received from each official assur
ance that the provision had no purpose
inconsistent with the policy of equality
of opportunity to which the sijrna
tories, in common with the United
States, are pledged.
Relations With Japan.
Our traditional relations with the
Japanese empire continue cordial, as
usual. As the representative of Japan
his Imperial highness Prince Kunl
visited the Hudson-Fulton celebration.
The recent visit . of a delegation of
prominent business men as guests of
the chambers of commerce of the Ft.
clflc slope, whose representatives nil
been so agreeably received In Japan,
will doubtless contribute to the grow,
ing trade across the Pacific, m well as
to that mutual understanding which
leads to mutual appreciation. The ar
rangement of 1908 for a co-operative
control of the coming of laborers to
the United States has proved to work
satisfactorily. The matter of a revi
sion of the existing treaty between th
United States and Japan which is ter-
ETnable In 10l2"Ii already "receiving
the study of both countries.
The department of state is consider
ing the revision in whole or in part of
the existing treaty with Slam, which'
was concluded In 1856 and is now, In
respect to many of Its provlajojftsv out

The Department f diet.
I earnestly recommend to the favor
able action of the congress the esti
mates submitted by the department ef
6tate and most especially the legisla
tion suggested In the secretary of
Etate's letter of this date whereby It
will be possible to develop and make
permanent the reorganization of the
department upon modern lines In a
manner to make It a thoroughly ef
ficient instrument In the furtherance
of our foreign trade and of American -Interests
abroad. The plan to have
divisions of Latin American and far
eastern affairs and to Institute a cer
tain specialization in business with
Europe and the near east will at once
commend Itself. These politico-geographical
divisions and the detail from
the diplomatic or consular service to
the department of a number of men
who bring to the study of complicated
problems In different parts of the world
practical knowledge recently gained on
the spot clearly Is of the greatest ad
vantage to the secretary of state In,
foreseeing conditions likely to arise '
and In conducting the great variety of
correspondence and negotiation. It
fibould be remembered that such facil
ities exist in the foreign offices of all
the leading commercial nations and
that to deny them to the secretary of
state would be to place this govern- '
ment at a great disadvantage In the
rivalry of commercial competition.
Improved Consular ftcrvio.
The consular service has been great
ly improved under the law of April 5,
190C and the executive order of June
27, 1900, and I commend to your con-?
6lderation the question of embodying ,
in a statute the principles of the pres
ent executive order upon which the
efficiency of our consular service is
w holly dependent.
In modern times political and com
mercial interests are Interrelated, and
In the negotiation of commercial trea
ties, conventions and tariff agreements.
the keeping open of opportunities and
the proper support of American enter
prises our diplomatic service is quite
as important as the consular service to
the business Interests of the country.
Impressed with this Idea and con
vinced that selection after rigorous ex
amination, promotion for merit solely
and the experience only to be gained
through the continuity of an organized
service are Indispensable to a high de
gree of efficiency In the diplomatic
service, I have signed an executive or
der as the first step toward this very
desirable result. Its effect should be
to place all secretaries .In the diplo
matic service in much the same posi
tion as consular officers are now placed
and to tend to the promotion of tho
most efficient to the grade of minister, f.
generally leaving for outside appoint
ment such posts of the grade of am
bassador or minister as it may be ex
pedient to fill from without the serv
ice. It Is proposed also to continue
the practice Instituted last summer of
giving to all newly appointed secre
taries nt least one mouth's thorough
training In the department of state be
fore they proceed to their posts. This
has been done for some time in regard
to tho consular service with excellent
results.
Under a orovislon of the net of Aug.
C. 1909. I have appointed three officials
to assist the officers of the government
In collecting information necesfiry to
a wise administration of the tariff act
of Aug. 5. 19U9. As to quesrlous f
customs administration they are co
operating with the offlclnls of the
treasury department and as to matters
of the needs and the exigencies of our
manufacturers and exporters with the
depnrtment of commerce and labor in
Rs relation to the domestic aspect of
the subject of foreign commerce. In
the study of foreign tnrlff treatment
fhey will assist the bureau of trade
relations of the department of state.
It is hoped thus to co-ordinate and
