have to make. The president then
ent to congress the following message:
To the Congress of the United States:
As representatives of the people in the legis
lative branch of their government you have as
sembled at a time when tbe strength and ex
cellence of our free institutions and the titness
f our citizens to enjoy popular rule have been
again made manifest. A political contest in
volving momentous consequences, fraught
with feverish apprehension and creatinK ag
gressiveness so intense as to approach bitter
ness and passion, has been waged throughout
ur land and determined by the decree of free
and independent suffrage, without disturbance
mt our tranquility or the least sign of weakness
In our national structure. When we consider
taese incidents and contemplate the peaceful
tbedience and manly submission which have
succeeded a heated clash of political opinions
we discover abundant evidence of a determi
nation on the part of our countrymen to abide
toy every verdict of the popular will and to be
controlled at all times by an abiding faith in
the agencies established for tbe direction of
the affairs of theirgnvernncent. Thus our peo
ple exhibit a patriotic disposition which en
titles them to demand of those who undertake
to make and execute their laws such faithful
and unselfish service in their behalf as can
only be prompted by a serious appreciation of
the trust and confidence which the acceptance
of public duty invites. In obedience to a con
timtional requirement. I herein submit to the
congress certain information concerniug na
tional affairs, with the suggestion of such leg
islation as in my judgment is necessary and
expedient. To secure brevity and avoid tire
tome narration, I shall omit many'details con
cerning matters within federal control which,
though by no means unimportant, are more
profitably discussed in departmental reports.
C shall also curtail this communication by
emitting minute recital of many minor inei
seatt connected with our foreign relations
which have hitherto found a place in executive
messages, but are now contained in a report of
the secretary of state, which is herewith sub
mitted. The Armenian Question.
At the outset of a reference to more impor
tant matters affecting our relations with foreign
powers it would afford me satisfaction if I
could assure ihe congress that the disturbed
condition of Asiatic Turkey had during the
past year assumed a less hideous and bloody
aspect and that either as a consequence of the
awakening of the Turkish government to the
demands of human civilization, or as the re
sult of decisive action on the part of the great
nations having the right by treaty to interfere
Yor the protection of those exposed to tbe rage
of mere bigotry and cruel fanaticism, the
shocking features of the situation had been
niti;ated. Instead, however, of welcoming a
of teuing disposition or protective Interven
tion, we have b?en afflicted by continued and
not unfrequent reports of the wanton destruc
tion of homes and the bloody butchery of men,
women and children, mads martyrs to their
profession of Christian faith. While none of
our cft'zens in Turkey have thus far been
tt tiled or wounded, though often in the midst
of dreadful scenes of danger, their safety in
the future is by no means assured. Our gov
ernment at home and our minister at Constan
tinople have left nothing undone to protect our
missionaries in Ottoman territory, who const! -tnte
nearly all the individuals residing there
who have a right to claim our protection on
the score of American citizenship.
Several naval vessels are stationed in the Med
iterranean as a measure of caution and to fur
nish, all possible relief and refuge in case of
emergency. We have made claims against the
l"urkish government for the pillage and de
struction of missionary property at Harpool
aqJ Marasa during uprisings at those places.
The Insurrection in Cabas.
The insurrection in Cuba still continues with
til its perplexities. It is difficult to perceive
that any progress has thus far been made to
srards the pacification of the island or that the
'Situation of affairs as depicted in my last an
nual message has in the least improved. If
Apain still holds Havana and the seaports and
mil considerable towns, the insurgents still
roam at will over at least two-thirds of the in
land country. If the determination of Spain
So put down the insurrection seems but to
strengthen with the lapse of time and is
evidenced by her unhesitating devotion
af largely increased military and naval
forces to the task, there is much rea
son to believe that the insurgents have gained
in point of numbers, and character, and
resources, and are none the less inflexible in
their resolve not to succumb, without practi
cally securing the great project for which they
took up arms. If Spain has not yet re-estab-iished
her authority, neither h ive the insur
gents yet made good their title to be regarded
as an independent state. Indeed, as the con
test has gou on. the pretense that civil gov-
-ernment exists on the island, except so far as
Spain Is able to maintain it. has been practi
cally abandoned. Spain does keep on foot such
a government, more or less Imperfectly, in the
targe towns and their Immediate suburbs.
Hut. that exception being made, the entire 1
country is either given over to an
archy or is subject to the mili
tary occupation of one or tbe other
party. It is reported, indeed, on re.ia.ble au
Snorlty that, mt the demand of the commander-in-chief
of the insurgent army, the putative
Cuban government has now given up all at
tempt to exercise its functions, leaving that
government confessedly (what there is the
best reason for, supposing it always to have
teea in fact) a government merely on paper.
Were the Spanish armies able to meet their
antagonists in the open, or in pitched battle,
prompt and decisive results might bo
looked for and the immense superiority
of the Spanish forces in numbers,
discipline and equipments could hardly
fail to tell greatly to their advantage.
But they are called upon to face a foe that
shuns general engagements, that can choose
and does c boose its own ground, that from the
mature of the country is visible or invisible at
pleasure and that fights only from ambuscade
and when all the advantages of position and
numbers are on its side. In a country where
mil that is indispensable to tife In the way of
food, clothing and shelter is so easily obtain
able especially by those born and bred on the
aoil it is obvious that there is hardly a limit to
Che time during which hostilities of this sort
nay be prolonged. Meanwhile, as in alt
cases of protracted civil strife, the pas
jSions of the combatants grow more and
more Inflamed and excesses on both sides
become more frequent and more deplorable.
They also are participated in by bands of
marauders, w ho now in the name of one party
and now in the name of the other as may best
suit the occasion, harry the country at will
and plunder its wretched inhabitants for their
wn advantage. Such a condition of things
vrould inevitably entail immense destruction
or property even if it were the policy of both
parties to prevent tt as far as practicable. But
while such seemed to be the original policy of
. the Spanish government, it has now apparent
ly abandoned it. and is acting upon the same
theory as the insurgents, nam el v. that the ex
igencies of the contest require the wholesale
annihilation of property, that it may not
wove of use and advantage to the enemy.
St is to the same end that in pursuance of gen
eral orders. Spanish garrisons are now being
withdrawn from plantations and the rural pop
ulation required to concentrate Itself in the
towit The sure result would seem to be that
th fudustrial value of the island is fast di
minishing and unless there is a speedy and
radical change i existing conditions, it will
jsooa disappes" v wether. That value con
sists very largely, of course, in Its capacity to .
produce sugars, a capacity already much re- :
duced by tbe interruption to tillage, which
have taken place during the last two years.
It is reliably asserted that should these in- I
terruptions continue during the currant year,
and practically extend, as it is now threat
ened, to the entire sugar producing territory
of the island, so much time and so much
money will be required to restore the land to
Its normal productiveness that it is extremly
doubtful if capital can be induced to even
make the attempt. The spectacle of the utter
ruin of an adjoining country, by nature one of .
the most fertile and charming on the globe '
woul i engage the serious attention of the gov-
ernment and people of the United States under ,
any circunwstances. In point of fact, they !
have a concern with it which is by 1
no means of a wholly sentimental
or philanthropic character. It lies so near to j
us as to be hardly separated from our territory. I
Our actual pecuniary interest in it is second 1
only to that of the people and government of :
Spain. It is reasonably estimated that at least '
from i30.O00.U0J to $o. 0.000 of American cap- j
ital are invested in plantations and in railroad,
mining and other business enterprises on the
island. The volume of trade between the '
United States and Cuba, which in 1389 amount
ed to about $64,000,000. rose in 1393 to about
$103.0. 0.000. and in 1891. the year before the in
surrection broke out. amounted to nearly 96,-00-4,0
0. Besides this large pecuniary stake in
the fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds
itself inextricably involved in the present con
test in other wars, both vexatious and costly.
Many Cubans reside in this country and directly
promote the insurrection through the press by
public meetings, by the purchase and shipment
of arms, by the raising of funds and by other
means which the spirit of our institutions and
the tenor of our laws do not permit to be made
the subject of criminal prosecution. Some of
them, though Cubans at heart and in all their
feelings in interests, have taken out papers as
naturalized citizens of the United States, a
proceeding resorted to with a view to possible ,
protection bv tb is government and not unnatu
rally regarded with much indignation by the ;
country of their origin. j
These inevitable entanglements of the
United States with the rebellion in Cuba, the
large American property interests affected
and considerations of philanthropy and hu
manity in general have led to a vehement de
mand in various quarters for some sort of pos
itive intervention on the part of the United
States. It was at first proposed that belliger
ent rights should be accorded to the insur
gents a proposition no longer urged because
untimely and in practical operation clearly
perilous and iujurions to our own
interests. It has since been and
is now sometimes contended that the
independence of tbe insurgeuts should be
recognized. But imperfect and restricted as
tbe Spanish government of the Island may be. .
no other exists there, unless the will of the
military officer in temporary command of a
particular district can be dignified as a
species of government. It is now suggested
that the United States should buy the island, a
f-uzgestion possibly worthy of consideration if
there were any evidence of a desire or
willingness on the part of Spain to en
tertain such a proposal. It is urged, finally,
that all other methods failing, the existing in
ternecine strife in Cuba should be terminated
by our intervention, even at the cost of war
between the United States and Spain, a war
which its advocates confidently prophecy could
be neither large in its proportions nor doubtful
in its issue. The correctness of this forecast
need be either affirmed nor denied. The United
States has nevertheless the character to main
tain as a natien, which plainly dictates that
right and might should be tbe rule of its con
duct. It would seem that if Spain should offer to
Cuba genuine autonomy, a measure of home
rule which. while preserving ths sovereignty of
Spain would satisfy oil rational requirements
of her Spanish subjects, thare should be no
just reason why the pacification of the island
might not be effected on that bais. It was in
timated by this government to the government
of Spain some months ago tb.it if a satisfac
tory measure of home rule were tendered
the Cuban insurgents and would be ac
cepted by them upon a guaranty of its
exec u t ion the Un ited States would en
deavor to find a way not objection
able to Sonin of furnishing such guaranty.
Ii should be added that it cannot be reasonably
assumed that the hitherto expectant attitude
of the United States will be indefinitely main
tained. While we are anxious to a -cord all
due respect to the sovereignty of Spain, we
cannot view the pending conflict in all its
features, and properly apprehend our inevita
ble relations to it and its possible results with
out considering that by tbe course of events
we may be drawn Into such an unusual and
unprecedented condition as will fix a limit to
our patient waiting for Spain to end
the contest, either alone and in
her own way. or with our friendly co-operation.
When the inability of Spain to deal success
fully with the insurrection has become mani
fest, and it is demonstrated that her sover
eignty is extinct in Cuba for all purposesof its
rishtful existence, and when a hopeless strug
gle for its Te-establishment has degenerated
into a strife which means nothing more than
the useless sacrifice of human life and then
utter destruction of the very subject matter or
the conflict, a situation will be presented in
which our obligations to the sovereignty of
Spain will be superseded by higher obligations
which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and
discharge.
The Venezuelan Boundary Question.
The Venezuelan boundary question has
ceased to be a matter of difference between
Great Britain and the United States, their re
spective governments having agreed upon the
substantial provisions of a treaty between
Great Britain and Venezuela submitting the
whole controversy to arbitration. The provi
sions of tbe treaty are so eminently just and
fair that the assent of Venezuela thereto may
confidently be anticipated.
Government Revenues and Expenses.
The secretary of the treasury reports that
during the fiscal year ended June 30. 1806, the
receipts of the government from all sources
amounted to $49,47..4 -8.78. During the same
period its expenditures were $43.687.6x.48.
The excess of expenditures over receipts thus
amounted to $i5,2i3.23.7a The ordinary ex
penditures during the year were $4,0i:,852.21
lss than during the preceding fiscal year. Of
the receipts mentioned there were derived
from customs the sum of $180,021,761.67, and
from internal revenue, $146 830.6la.60, The re
ceipts from customs show an increase of $7,
863,131.22 over those from the same source for
the fiscal year endett June 30, 1895, and the re
ceipts from internal revenue an increase of
t3.r84.537.9l.
The value of our imported dutiable merchan
dise during the last fiscal year was 3t9,757,T0
and the value of free goods imported $4 ,9.967.
470, being an increase of $6.523,67 in the value
of dutiable goods and 391.231.034 in the value of
free goods over the preceding year. Our ex
ports of merchandise, foreign and domestic, j
amounted in value to $832,6 (6.928, being an in-1
crease over tbe preceding year of $7 -,068.773.
The average ad valorem duty paid on dutiable
goods imported during the year was 39.94 per
cent, and on free and dutiable goods taken to
gether 20.53 per cent.
Tbe total amount of gold exported was $11?.
49.947 and of silver $6J,M1.670,being an increase
of $45,941,446 of gold and $13,246.38 of silver
over the exportation of the preceding fiscal
year. The imports of gold were s3S,52o,6 and
of silver SJS.777.196, being 2.8 9.694 less of gold
and 8.x6iu07 more of stiver than during the
preceding year. The total stock of metallic
money in the United States at the close of tbe
last fiscal year ending on the 30th day of June.
was tl .228.326. of which $193.a97,934 was
of gold and $628,733,671 of silver.
On the 1st day of November. 1896, the total
stock of money of all kinds in the country was
$?.-8.4ia.:90 and tlie amount in circulation, not
including that ia the treasury holdings, was
l.27.05,641. being $? 6 per capita upon an
estimated population of 71,9J.0ua
The production of the precious metals in the
United States during the calendar year 189 is
estimated to have been .2M.76t fine ounces of
gold of the value of $46.6l,oan and a.T.Oun
fine ounces of silver, of the commercial value
of f36.44i.0J0 and the coinage value of &7
0.1.000.
The total eolnage at the mint or the United
States during the fiscal year ended June so,
1896, amounted to 171, 188.96a.-S. of whica a&
878, 49J was in gold coin and $!6.8.&;8.S2 in

culating notes amounting to 21 1.41 2,620.
The total outstanding circulating notes of all
national banks on the list of October, 1896
amounted to $234. d3.8u7t including unredeemed,
but fully secured notes of banks insolvent and
in process of liquidation. Tbe increase in na
tional bank circulation during the year ended
on that day was 21.u99.4A1l On October. 1896.
when the condition of national banks was last
reported, the total resources of the 3.679 active
institutions was $3.263,68.3i3.83. which in
cluded tl. 893.208.8 9l 31 in loans and discounts
and $36M6738S la money of all kinds on
hand. Of their liabilities $1.97.891.08 was due
to individual depositors and $209.94,019 con
sisted of outstanding circulating notes.
Tbe War Department.
The report of the secretary of war exhibits
satisfactory conditions in the several branches
of the public service intrusted to his charge.
The limit of our artillery force as fixed by law
is constantly and readily maintained. The
present discipline and morals of the army are
excellent and marked progress and efficiency
are apparent throughout its entire organiza
tion. With the exception of delicate duties in
the suppression of slight Indian disturbances
along our southwestern boundary in which the
Mexican troops co-operated and the compul
sory, but peaceful return with the consent of
Great Britain of a band of Cree Indians from
Montana to the British possessions, no active
operation have been required of the army dur
ing the past year.
The organized militia numbers 112,879 men.
The appropriations for its support by the sev
eral states approximate $2,800.0-10 annually and
$4u0.000 is contributed by the general govern
ment. Investigation shows these troops to be
unusually well drilled and inspired with much
"military interest, and in many instances they
are so deficient in proper arms and equipment
that a sudden call to active duty would find
them inadequately prepared for field service.
I therefore recommend that prompt measures
be taken to remedy this condition and that
every encouragement be given to this deserv
ing body of unpaid and voluntary citizen sol
diers upon whose assistance we must largely
rely in time of trouble-
During the past ye3r rapid progress has been
made toward the completion of the scheme
adopted for the erection and armament of for
tifications along our sea coast, while equal
progress has been made in providing the mate
rial for submarine defense in connection with :
these works. This improvel situation is largely
due to the recent generous response of congress
to the recommendations of the war department.
The Attorney-u en eral'a Department.
The attorney -general presents a detailed and
interesting statement of the important work
done under his supervision during the last
fiscal year. The ownership and management
by the government of penitentiaries for the
confinement of the convicted in the United
States courts of violations of federal laws,
which for many years has been a subject of
executive recommendation, has at last to
a slight extent been realized by the utiliza
tion of the abandoned military prison at Fort
Leavenworth as a United States penitentiary.
This is certainly a movement in the right di
rection: but it ought to ba at once supple
mented by the rebuilding or extensive enlarge
ment of this improvised prison and the con
struction of at least one more, to be located in
the southern states. The capacity of the
Leavenworth penitentiary is so limited that
the expense of its maintenance, calculated at
a per capita rate upon the number of prisoners
it can accommodate does not make as econom
ical an exhibit as it would if it were
larger and better adapted to prison
purposes: but I am thoroughly con
vinced that economy, humanity and a proper
sense of responsibility and duty toward those
whom we punish for violation of federal law !
dictate that the federal government have the
entire control and management of the peniten
tiaries where convicted violators are confined.
It appears that since the transfer of the Fort
Leavenworth military prison to its new uses
the work previously done by the prisoners con
fined there, and for which expensive machin
ery has been provided, has been discontinued.
This work consisted of the manufacture of
articles for army use, now done elsewhere. On
all grounds it is exceeding. y desirable that the
convicts confined in this penitentiary be al
lowed to resume work of this description.
The Post Office Department
Our post office department is in good condi
tion and tbe exhibit made of its operations
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896. if
allowance is made for imperfections in the
laws applicable to it, is very satisfactory. The
total receipts during the year were $8 .499, 208. 40.
The total expenditures were f9Q.626.29&84, ex
clusive of $1,.-k9.89827, which wasearned by the
Pacific railroad for transportation and credit
on their debt to the government. There was
an increase of receipts over the previous year
of $5,516,' 8 K'iU or 7.1 per cent., and an increase
of expenditures of $l.83J.124.0;, or 4.43 per cent.
The deficit was $l,e79.96. 19 less than that of
the preceding year. The chief expenditures
of the postal service are regulated by law and
are not in control of the postmaster-gene raL
All that he can accomplish by the most watch
ful administration and economy is to enforce
prompt and thorough collection and account
ing for public moneys and such minor savings
in small expenditures and in letting those con
tracts for post office supplies and star service
which are not regulated by statute.
The average revenue from each pound of
first-class matter was 93 cents. From each
pound of second-class. 84 mills (of the second
class 52,348, .97 was county free matter). From
each pound of third-class. 13.1 cents. From
each pound of fourth-class. 1.6 cents. The
growth in weight of second-class matter has
been from 299,000,0 K pounds in 1894 to 312,000,
000 in 189-V and to almost 349,000,000 in
1896, and it Is quite evident this in
creasing drawback is far outstripping
any possible growth of postal revenues
Our mail service should, of course, be such
as to meet the wants and even the conven
iences of the people, at a direct charge upon
them so light as perhaps to exclude the idea of
our post office department being a money
making concern, but in the face of constantly
recurring deficiencies in its revenue.and in view
of the fact that we supply the best mail serv
ice in the world, it seems to me it is quite
time to correct the abuses that swell enor
mously our annual deficit. If we concede the
public policy of carrying weekly newspapers
free in the county of publication and
even the policy of carrying at
less than one-tetnh of their cost
other bona fide newspapers and periodicals,
there can be no excuse for subjecting the serv
ice to the further immense and increasing loss
involved in carrying at the nominal rate of one
cent a pound the serial libraries, sometimes
including trashy and even harmful literature
and other matter, which under the loose inter
pretation of a loose statute has been gradually
given second-class rates, thus absorbing all
profitable returns derived from first-class
matter, which pays three or four times more
than its cost, and producing a large annual
loss to be paid by general taxation.
Experience and observation have demon
strated that certain improvements In the or
ganization of the post office department must
be serve! before we can gain the full benefit of
the immense sums expended in its administra
tion. This involves t he following reforms,
which I earnestly recommend: There should
be a small addition to the existing Inspector
service, to be employed in the supervision of
the carrier force, which now numbers 13.000
men and performs its service practically
without the surveillance exercised over all
other branches of the postal or public service-
There should also be appointed a few inspect
ors who would assist the central office in nec
essary investigation concerning matters of
post office leases, post office sites, allowance
for rent, fuel and lights, and in organizing and
securing the best results from the work of the
14.1 0 clerks now employed In first and second-
olass offloea
Tbe 7?avT Department.
The work of the navy department and its
present conditions are fully exhibited In the
report of the secretary. The construction of
vessels for our navy has been energetically
prosecuted by the present administration upon
the general lines previously adopted, the de
partment having seen bo necessity for radical
changes in prior methods under which the
work was found to ba progressing la a manner
highly satisfarcory. It has been decided. ;
however, to provide in every ship building eon- -,
tract that the builder should pay all trial ex
peases, and it ha also been determined to
pay no speed premiums in future contracts, j
On March 4. 193. there were ia commission but 1
two armored vessels, the dou ble-turreted J
monitors Miantonomoh and Monterey. Since '
that date, of vessels theretofore authorized, j
there have been placed in their first commia- ;
sion three first-class and two second-class bat- I
tleships. two armored cruisers, one harbor de- J
fense ram and five double-tnrreted monitors,
including Maine and Puritan, jutt completed. ,
Eight new unarmored cruisers and two new .
gunboats have also been commissioned. The
Iowa, another' battleship, will be completed
about March 1. and at least four more gunboats
wifi be ready for sea in the early spring.
oThe war college has developed into an insti
tution which it is believed will be of great
value to the nary in teaching the science of
war, as well as in stimulating professional
zeal In the navy, and it will be especially use
ful In the devising of plans for the utilization,
in case of necessity, of all the naval resources
of the United States.
The naval militia, which was authorized a
few years ago, as an experiment, has now de
veloped into a body of enterprising young men.
active and energetic in the discharge of
their duties and promising great usefulness.
This establishment has nearly the same relation
to our navy as the national guard m the differ
ent states bears to our army, and constitutes a
source of supply to our naval forces, the im
portance of which is immediately apparent.
The Interior Department.
The report or the secretary of the Interior
presents a comprehensive and interesting ex
hibit of the numerous and important affairs
committed to his supervision It is impossible
in this communication to do more than briefly
refer to a few of the subjects concerning which
the secretary gives full and instructive infor
mation. Our public lands, originally amount
ing to 1.810.000.0J0 acre-; have been so reduced
that only about 600."lO.'Oj acres still remain in
government control, excluding Alaska. The
balance, being by far the most valuable por
tion, has beea given away to suttlers, to new
states and to railroads, or sold at a compara
tively nominal sum.
Tbe total Indian population of the United
States is 177.33. according to a census made in j
1S9j. exclusive of those within tbe state of New
York and those comprising the Ave civilized !
tribes. Of this number there are approxi- !
mately 38,000 children of school age. During
the year 23,393 of these were enrolled in
schools. The progress which has attended re- ;
cent efforts to extend Indian school facilities
and the anticipatian of conti nued liberal ap
propriations to that end. cannot fail to afford
the utmost satisfaction to those who
believe that the education of In
dian children is a prime factor in the
accomplishment of Indian civilization.
The condition of affairs among the five civilized
tribes, who occupy large tracts of land in the
Indian territory and who have governments of
their own, has assumed such an aspect as to
render it almost indispensable that there
should be an entire change in the relations of
these Indians to the general government. This
seems to be necessary in furtherance of their
own interests as well as for the protection of
non-Indian resident in their territory. A
commission organized and empowered under
several recent laws is now negotiating with
these Indians for the relinquishment of their
courts and tbe division of their common lands
in severalty.
The reception of their first proffers of nego
tiation was hot encouraging, but through pa
tience and such conduct on their part as dem
onstrated that their intentions were friendly
and in the interest of the best prospect of suc
cess has become more promising. The efforts
should be to save tbe Indians from the conse
quences of their own mistakes and Improvi
dence and to secure to the real Indian his
rights as against intruders and professed
friends who profit by his retogression.
A change is also needed to protect life and
property through the operation of courts con
ducted according to strict justice and strong
enough to enforce their mandates.
As a sincere friend of the Indian I am ex
ceedingly anxious that these reforms should
be accomplished with the consent and aid of
the tribes and that no necessity may be pre
sented for radical or drastic legislation. I
hope, therefore, that the commission now con
ducting negotiations will soon be able to report
that progress has been made toward a friendly
adjustment of existing difficulties
It appears that a very valuable deposit of
gilsonite or asphaltum has been found on the
reservation in Utah occupied by the Uncom
pahgre Ute Indians. Every consideration of
care for the public interest and every sensible
business reason dictate such management or
disposal of this important source of public
revenue as will except it from the general
rules and incidents attending the ordlnary"dis-
position of public lands, and secure to the gov
ernment a fair share at least of its advantages
in place of its transfer for a nominal sum to
interested Individuals.
I indorse the recommendation made by the
present secretary of the interior, as well as his
predecessor, that a permanent commission.
consisting of three members, one of whom
shall be an army officer, be created to perform
the duties now devolving upon the commis
sioner and assistant commissioner of Indian
affairs. The management of the bureau in
volves such numerous diversities and the
advantages of an uninterrupted policy are so
apparent that I hope the change suggested
will meet the approval of the congress.
The Pennlon Roll.
The diminution of our enormous pension
roll and the decrease of pension expenditures
which have been so often foretold still fail in
material realization. The number of pension
ers on the rolls at the close of the fiscal year
ended June 3), 1 893, was 970.678. This is the
largest number ever reported. The amonnt
paid exclusively for pensions during the year
was $138,214,761.91. a slight decrease from that
of the preceding year, while the total expend
itures on account of pensions, including the
cost of maintainence of the department
and expenses attending pension distribution
amounted to $142,206.90.59. or within a very
small fraction of one-third of the entire ex
pense of supoorting the government during tbe
same year. The number of new pension certifi
cates issued was. 90.64a Of these 40,374 repre
sent original allowances of claims and 15,878
increases of existing pensions. The number of
persons receiving pensions from the United
States, but residing in foreign countries atthe
close of the last fiscal year was 3,781, and the
amonnt paid to them during the year was
$582,735.38. The sum appropriated for the pay
ment of pensions for the current fiscal year,
ending June 30, 1897. is $140,0 .0J. and for the
succeeding year it is estimated that the same
amount will be necessary.
The commissioner of pensions reports that
during the last fiscal year 339 indictments
were found against violators of the pension
laws Upon these indictments 167 convictions
resulted. In my opinion, based upon such
statements as these and much other informa
tion and observations, the abuses which have
been allowed to creep into our pension system
have done incalculable harm in demoralizing
our people and undermining good citizenship
I have endeavored within my sphere of official
duty to protect our pension roll and make it
what it should be. a roll of honor, containing
the names of those disabled in their country's
service and worthy of their country's affection
and remembrance.
The Pacific Railroad.
The secretary calls attention to the public
interests Involved in an adjustment of the ob
ligations of the Pacific railroads to the govern
ment. I deem It to be an important duty to es
pecially present this subject to the consider
ation of the congress. On January 11. 1897,
with the amount already matured, more than
$13,000,000 of the principal of the subsidiary
bond Issued by the United States in aid of the
construction of tbe Union Pacific railway, in
cluding its Kansas line, and more than $6,000,
ooo of like bonds, issued in aid of the Central
pacific railroad, including those issued to the
Western Pacific Railway Co., will have fallen
due and beea paid or must oa that
day be paid by the government. With
out any reference to the application of
the sinking funds now In the treasury
this will create such a default oa the part of
the companies to the government aa will give
it tbe right to at once institute proceedings to
foreclose Its mortgage Ilea. Ia addition to
this indebtedness which will be due January
1. 1897. there will mature between that date
aad January L 1899, the remaining ariaalpal at
such subsidy bonds which nmt also be met by
the government, Tbeas amount to more than
S2.000.00 on account of tbe Union Pacific '
lines and exceeds f2l,OJO,000 oa account of tae
Central Pacific llnea.
The Agricultural Department

mately related to t he welfare of omr people and
the prosperity of our oat ion that ft hmiH eon- :

the value of our exports of farm products ear- j
ing the last fiscal year amounted to j
$ 70.000.000. an increase of t17.OfW.9JO over
those of the year Immediately preceding
This statement la not tbe less welcome be
cause of the fact that notwithstanding sorb in
crease, tbe proportion of exported agricultural '
products to our total exports of all description
fell off during the year. The benefits of aa in
crease in agricultural prod acta being assured,
the decrease in its proportion to our total ex
ports is more gratifying when we consider tht
it la coming to the fact that such total exports
for the year Increased more than 7..wi0.00.
The large and increasing exportation of our
agricultural products suggest the great use
fulness of the organization lately established
in the department for tbe purpose of getting
to those engaged In the farming pursuits re
liable information concerning the condition,
needs and advantages of different foreign
markets. Inasmuch as the success of the
farmer depends upon the advantageous sale
of his products, and inasmuch as foreign mar
kets mut largely be the destination or such
product?, it is quite apparent that a knowledge
of the conditions acd wants that affect
thee markets ou?ht to result in
sowing more Intelligently and reap
ing with a better promise of profit.
Such Information points out the way to a pru
dent foresight in the selection and cultiva
tion of crops and to a release from the bond
age of unreasoning monotomy of protection, a
glutted and depressed market and constantly
recurring unprofitable toiL In my opinion the
gratuitous distribution of seeds by the depart
ment ' as at present conducted ought to be
discontinued.
Civil Service Reform.
The progress made in civil service reform
furnishes a cause for the utmost congratula
tion. It has survived the doubts of its friends
as well as the rancor of Its enemies, and has
gained a permanent place umong the agencies
destined to cleanse our politics and improve.
economize and elevate the public service.
There are now in the competitive classified
service upwards of 84.00 places. More than
half of these have been included from time to
time since March 4, 1893. A most radical and
sweeping extension was made by executive
order dated the 6th day of May, 1896,
and if fourth-class postmasters hips are not in
cluded in the statement it may be said that
practically all positions contemplated by the
civil service law are now classified. Abundant
reasons exist for including these postmaster
ships, based upon economy, improved service
and tbe peace and quiet of neighborhoods. If,
however, obstacles prevent such action at
present, I earnestly hope that congress will,
without increasing post office appropriations,
so adjust them as to permit in proper cases of
a consolidation of these post offices to the end
that through this process the result desired
may to a limited extent be accomplished.
The civil service rules as amended during
the last year provide for a sensible and uni
form method of promotion, basing eligibility
to better positions upon demonstrated effi
ciency and faithfulness. The absence of fixed
rules on this subject has been an infirmity in
the system more and more apparent: its other
benefits have been better appreciated. The
advantages of civil service methods in their
business aspects are too well understood to re
quire argument. Their application has be
come a necessity to the executive work of tbe
government But those who gain through
the operation of these methods should
be made to understand that the
non - partisan scheme through which
they receive their appointments de
mands from them, by way of reciprocity non
partisan and faithful performance of duties
under every administration, and cheerful fidel
ity to every chief. While they should be en
couraged to decently exercise their rights of
citizenship and to support through their suf
frage the political belief they honestly pro
fess, the noisy, pestilent and partisan em
ploye, who loves political turmoil and conten
tion, or who render lax and. grudging
service to an administration not rep
resenting his political views, should be
promptly ' and fearlessly delt with in
such a way as to furnish a warning to others
who may be likewise disposed. The annual
report ot the commissioners will be daly trans
mitted and I conmmead the important matter
they have in charge to the careful considera
tion of congress.
The Tariff.
I desire to recur to the statements else
where made concerning . the government re
ceipts and expenditures for the purpose of
venturing upon some suggestions touching our
present tariff law and its operations. This
statute took effect on the 28th day of August,
1894. Whatever may be its shortcomings as a
comptete measure of tariff reform, it must be
conceded that . it has opened up the
way to a freer and greater ex
change of commodities between us and other
countries and thus furnished a wider market
for our products and manufactures. The
only entire fiscal year during which this law
has been in force ended on the 30th day of
June, 1896. In that year our imports increased
over those of the previous year more than
$6.&00,0J0 while the value of the domestic prod
ucts exported and which found mar
kets abroad was nearly 470,0.0,000
more than during the preceding year.
Those who insist that the cost to our people
of articles coming to them from abroad for
their needful use should only be increased
through tariff changes to an extent necessary
to meet the expenses of the government, as
well as those who claim that tariff changes
may be laid upon such articles beyond the
necessities of government revenue, and witn
the additional purpose of so increasing their
price in our markets as to give American
manufacturers and producers better
and more . profitable opportunities,
must agree that our tariff laws
are only primarily justified as sources of
revenue to enable the government to meet the
necessary expenses of its maintenance. Con
sidered as to Its sufficiency In this aspect the
present law can by no means fall under just
condemnation. During the only complete fis
cal year of its operation it has yielded nearly
$8,000,000 more revenue than was received from
tariff duties in the preceding year. There was
nevertheless a deficit between our receipts and
expenditures of a little more than $25,000,
000. This, however, was not unexpected.
The situation was such in December last,
seven months before the close of the fiscal
year, that the secretary of the treasury fore
told a deficiency of $17,000,000. The great and
increasing apprehension and timidity in busi
ness circles and tbe depression In all activities
intervening since that tune, resulting from
causes perfectly well understood and entirely
disconnected with our tariff law or operation,
seriously checked the imports we would have
otherwise received and readily account for the
difference between this estimate of the secre
tary and the actual deficiency as well as for a
continued deficit.
I believe onr present tariff law. If allowed a
fair opportunity, will in the near future yield
a revenue which, with reasonably economical
expenditures, will overcome all difficulties.
In the meantime no deficit that has occurred
or may occur need excite or disturb us.
To meet such deficit we have in tbe treasury,
in addition to a gold reserve of $100.00J.OOI, a
surplus of more than $128,000,000 applicable to
payment of expenses of the government, and
which must, unless expended for that purpose,
remain a useless hoard, or, if not extravagantly
was ted, must in any event be perverted from the
purpose of its exaction from our people, the
payment, therefore, of any deficiency in the
revenue from this fund is nothing more than
its proper and legitimate use. It is Immeasur
ably better to appropriate our surplus to the
payment of justifiable expenses than to allow
it to become aa invitation to reckless appro
priations and extravagant expenditures.
I suppose it will not be denied that under tbe
present law our people obtain the necessaries
of a comfortable existence at a cheaper rate
than formerly. This la a matter of supreme
importance since it is toe palpable duty of
every Just government to make the burdens of
taxation as light as possible.' The people
should not be required to relinouisti this
privilege of ebeaoet Kving except under the
RtreM of their govern meat necessity mads
plainly manifest
Oar Pintaef! MthdU-
This reference to the condition and proa
peetfl of our revenues naturalfy suggests as
allusion to the weakness and vices of our finan
cial methods. They have been frequently
pressed upon the attention of congress in pre
vlous executive communications and the in
evitable danger of their continued toleratioa
pointed out Without now repeating these de
tails I aannfft rt-fraia from again earnest lv
presenting tbe necessity of the prompt reform
of a system opposed to every rule of sound
finance aad sbowa by experience io be fraogba
with tbe grivest peril and perplexity. Tne)
terrible civil war which shook tbe foundation
of our government more than $i years ago?
brought In Its train the destruction off property,
tbe wasting of eountry's substances, and the
estrangement of hretbera. These are now
past and forgotten. Even the distressing loam
of life the conflict entailed is but a sacred
memory, which fosters patriotic sentiment and
keep alive a tender regard for those whs
nobly died, snd yet tbere remains with ns to
day in full strength and activity as aa inci
dent of that tremendous struggle, a feature of
its financial necessity nvt only unsuited tooof
present circumstances, but manifestly a dis
turbing menace to business security and aa
ever present agent of monetary distress.
Becaue we may be enjoying a temporary re
lief from its depressing influence this should
not lull us into a false security nor lead us ts
forget the suddenness of past visitation. I ana
more convinced than ever that we cannot have
assured financial peace and safety until
the government obligations upon wbicb gold
may be demanded from the treasury are with
drawn from circulation and collected. This
might be done, at ba been heretofore recom
mended, bv their exchange for long term bonds
bearing a low rate of interest, or by their re
demption with the proceeds of such bond.
Even ir only the United States notes known as
greenbacks were thus retired, it Is probabk
that the treasury notes issued in payment ot
silver purchases under the act of July 14. 1890V
now paid in gold when demanded, would no
create much disturbance, as they mt?ht from
time to time, when received in the treasury by
redemption in gold or otherwise be gradually
and prudently replaced by silver coin.
This plan of issuing bonds for the purpose of
redemption certainly appears to be the most
effective and direct path to the needed reform.
In default of this, however, it would be a step
in the right direction if currency obligations
are redeemable in gold whenever so redeemed
should be cancelled instead of being reissued.
This operation would be a slow remedy, but 1$
would improve present conditions.
National banks should redeem their own,
notes. They should be allowed to issue circu
lation to the par value of bonds deposited as
security, for its redemption and the tax oa
their circulation should be reduced to one
fourth of one per cent.
In considering projects for the retirement of
United States notes and treasury notes issued
under the new law of 1890 I am of the opinion
we have placed too much stress upon the dan
ger of contracting the currency and have cal
culated too little upon the gold that would bs
added to our circulation If invited to us by bet
ter and safer financial methods. It is not so
much contraction of our currency that should
be avoided as its unequal distribution. This
might be obviated and fear of harmful con
traction at the same time removed by allowing
the organization of small banks and in less
populous communities than are now permitted
and authorizing existing banks to establish;
branches in small communities under proper
restrictions.
The entire case may be presented by ths
statement that the day of sensible and sound
financial methohs will not dawn upon us until
our government abandons the banking busi
ness and the accumulation of funds, and con
fines it3 monetary operations to the receipts
of money contributed by tbe people for its
support, and to the expenditure of such money
for the people's benefit. Our business inter
ests and ail good citizens long for rest from
feverish agitation and the inauguration by ths
government of a reformed financial policy
whicn will encourage enterprise and make
certain the rewards of labor and industry.
Trusts and Monopolies.
Another topic in which our people rightfully
take a deep interest may be here briefly con
sidered. I refer to the expense of trusts and
other huge aggregations of capital, the object
of which is to secure the monopoly of soms
particular branch of trade, industry, or com
merce and to stifle wholesome competition.
When these are defended it is usually on the
ground that though they increase profits they
also reduce prices and th us may benefit the)
public It mi: st be remembered, however, that
a reduction of prices to the people Is not one of
the real objects of these organizations, nor is
their tendency necessarily in that direction.
If it occurs in a particular case 1$
is only because it accords with the purposes
or interests of those managing them.
Such occasional results fall short of compen
sating the palpable evils charged to the ac
count of trusts and monopolies. Their ten
dency is to crush out individual independence)
and to hinder and to prevent the free use of
human faculties and the full development of
human charaoter. Ta rough them the farmer,
the artisan and the strvli trader Is in danger
of dislodgement from the proud position of be
ing his own matter, watchful of all that
touches his country's prosperity, in which he
has an Individual interest in all that affects ths
advantages of business of which be is a factor
to be relegated to the level of a mere appurte
nance to a great machine, with little free will,
with no duty but that of passive obedience and
with little hope or opportunity of rising in ths
scale of responsible and helpful citizenship.
To the instinctive belief that such is the inevi
table trend of trusts and monopolies is due ths
wide-spread and deep-seated popular aversion
in which they are held and the not unreasona
ble insistance that whatever may be their in
cidental economic advantages, their general
effect upon personal character, prospects and
usefulness can not be otherwise than injur ions.
Though congress has attempted to deal with
this matter by legislation, the laws passed for
that purpose thu3 far have proved ineffective
not because of any lack of disposition or at
tempt to enforce them but simply because ths
laws themselves as interpreted by the courts
do not reach the difficulty. If tne insufficien
cies of existing laws can be remedied by
further legislation it should be done. The
fact must be recognized, however, that all
federal legislation on this subject may fall
short of its purpose because of inher
ent obstacles, and also because of the complex
character of our governmental system, which
while making the federal authority supremo
within its sphere, has carefully limited that
sphere by metes and bounds which cannot bs
transgressed. The decision of our highest court
on this precise question renders it quite doubt
ful whether the evils of trusts and monopolies
can be adequately treated through federal ac
tion unless they seek directly and purposely to
include in their objects transportation or in
tercourse between states or between ths
United States and foreign countries.
It does not follow, however, that this Is ths
limit of the remedy that may be applied.
Even though it may be found that federal au
thority Is not broad enough to fully reach ths
case, there can be no doubt of tbe power of ths
several states to act effectively in the prem
ises, and there should be no reason to doubt
their willingness to judiciously exercise such,
power.
In concluding this communication its last
words shall be an appeal to the congress for
the most rigid economy in the expenditure of
the money it holds in trust for the people.
The way to perplexing extravagance Is easy,
but a return to frugality is difficult
When, however, it is considered that thoas
who bear the burdens of taxation have no
guaranty of honest care, save in the fidelity of
their public servants, the duty of all possiblo
retrenchment Is plainly manifest When our
difference are forgotten and our eon
testa of political opinion are no longer re
membered nothing in the retrospect of oar
public service will be as fortunate and com
forting as the recollection of official duty well
performed and the memory of a constant de
votion to the Interest of our confiding fellow
countrymen. Grovib Oi kvh;t Aft
