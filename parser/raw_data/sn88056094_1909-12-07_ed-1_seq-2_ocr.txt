BIOGRAPHICAL CALENDAR. I
William Morris, artist, poet and
tho original "simple lifer," was born
la Essex, Eeuglsnd, 76 years ago,
and died near London lu 1896. Ho
has left th* Impress of his Individ
uality on thing* aa widely dissimilar
as art and economics, painting and
furniture, embroidery and poetry.
Me had an intans* romantie taste,
even as n child, and he was fortunate
in having parents who allowod him
to cultivate this without restraint,
and to work out his problems of
thought.
Ho was an Exeter college (Oxford)
man and on* of th* remrakabl* mem
ber* of th* pre-Raphae!its group 6f
which Danta Oahrial Rosettl was the
leader. He found with those young
companions a congenial Interchange
of thought.
Ho went beyond them In hi* search
for tho truth In art, for ha sought
U everywhere. The crafts embod
ied th* highest arts for Morris, and
one of hia chief aims In life was to
awaken as interest .u these, and to
Indue* men to go hack to simple
forma of beauty, and again evolve
these by th* work of thalr hands.
Oa a momentous evening In Otford
h* saw at th* theatre a Miss Bur
den, then shout It years of age, with
whom he fell in love at one*. H*
eatd her face waa one that would ap
peal to the soulptor, aa wall aa th*
painter and th* poet. They were
married and th* wife found a happy
place la the life of Morris. Hia
friend* were hers, and In many of th*
most beautiful of Rosettl's symbolic
ptetarcs Mra. Morris' beauty waa th*
Inspiration and model.
One of the moat artlstlo poems of
William Morris had his wife aa the
them*—th* "Praise of My Lady"
with Its recurring phrase of ''Beta
mea Domlaa."

of the subordinate employes In tho

duty of the executive to consider the
