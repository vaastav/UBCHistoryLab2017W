Good Appointments bt the Mayor.?
Mayor Hall has appointed Edward Delafield
Smith Corporation Counsel, in place of Rich
ard 0'Gorman, who has resigned the position
ha has filled for seven years. The Mayor has
also appointed Richard M. Blatchford Park
Commissioner, in place of the late Robert C.
Dillon, and Rufus G. Beardslee to the De
partment of Public Instruction, in place of
Judge Van Vorst. These appointments will
satisfy all honest reformers.
In Good Tahte. ? The attendance of the
President and Vice President of the United
(States at Mr. Greeley's funeral to-day will be
properly appreciated as an act of generous
sympathy and as a graceful tribute to one

and useful to mankind. We may reasonably
aocept it as an indication that the bitterness
of the late political strife has passed away and
that the degrading personalities of the recent
campaign will never be renewed,
To Tcbemh Cabinet.?The question of
the succession to the Grand Viziership of
Turkey presents a subject for anxious diplo
matic canvass in the European capitals and at
the Court of Bi$ Highness the Khedive of
Egypt, as will be seen by ft cable telegram in
(be Hekaij) to-day.
The President's View a on Steamship
Subsidies ?n4 Trass-Allt(hsayr and
fksbosrd Canal*?A. itulnaus Hew
Depart are.
The distinguishing feature of the Presi
dent's policy for the future is that which is so
broadly indicated in his comprehensive recom
mendations and suggestions to Congress on
steamship subsidies and internal improve
ments. No half-way measures are here fore
shadowed, but a broad and comprehensive
system of bounties and subsidies which will
place the whole commerce of the United
States, external and internal, on the sea and
the land, in the position of a beggarly pauper,
to be fod from the national Treasury. A brief
recapitulation of the gratuities in this direc
tion recommended in the Message, and of the
grand canal schemes suggested as within the
province of Congress, will serve to disclose a
programme for government contributions to
private enterprises as broad as the absolute
power of the Czar of Russia, and fruitful in
corruptions, demoralizations and wasteful ex
penditures, with all their inevitably disastrous
consequences.
The President informs the two houses of
Congress that in addition to the railroads of
the country ' 'a project to facilitate commerce
by the building of a ship canal around Niagara
Falls, on the United States side (a grand
idea), which has been agitated for many
years, will, no doubt, be called to your atten
tention this session." Then, having broken ,
ground jipon the general subject, he submits
the expediency of an examination of "the
various practicable routes for connecting the
Mississippi with the tide waters of the Atlan
tic," and likewise the feasibility of an almost
continuous land-locked navigation from Maine
to the Gulf of Mexico." General Grant, re
garding this project with the eye of a soldier,
truly says that "Nature has provided the
greater part of this route ;" that "the obsta
cles to be overcome are easily within the skill
I of the engineer," and that "such a route
along our coast would be ot great value at all
times and of inestimable value in case of a
foreign war." This project, then, is a sea
board ship canal, as continuous as practicable
from Maine to Mexico, unquestionably a mag
nificent and most desirable improvement. But,
if undertaken by Congress, what will it cost ?
How many millions no man can tell.
Now, lot us look at the inland canal enter
prises to which the favorable attention of
Congress is invited. They embrace the proj
ect of a canal to connect the Mississippi Val
ley with the Atlantic, at Charleston, S. 0.,
and Savannah, Ga., by way of the Ohio and
Tennessee rivers, with canals and slack water
navigation to the Savannah and Ocmulgee
rivers ; the extension of the Kanawha and
James River Canal through the defiles of the
Alleghany Mountains to the Ohio River, and
the extension of the Chesapeake, and Ohio
Canal across the Alleghanies to the Ohio
River. We entirely agree with General Grant
in the opinion that all these improvements
are highly desirable in view of the more cer
tain and cheaper transportation of the heavy
and constantly increasing surplus produots of
the Western and Southwestern States to the
Atlantic seaboard. From the incalculable
commercial wen 1th which our great Erie Canal
has contributed to this metropolis and which
the Pennsylvania Trans-Alleghany Canal has
given to Philadelphia, it is not difficult to con
ceive that the increased Western trade which
similar canals would bring to Baltimore, to
Norfolk and to Charleston and Savannah
would vastly increase the wealth and popula
tion of those cities and of all the cities and
States along these lines. Bnt here the ques
tions intrude themselves?If Congress is to un
dertake those improvements, where and how
will the money be obtained? and when and
where will this Congressional business of in
ternal improvements come to an end?
Next, in regard to the proposed increase of
our steamship subsidies. To the Pacific Mail
Steamship line plying between San Francisco,
China and Japan, to the line plying between
the United States and Brazil, and to the Cali
fornia, New Zealand and Australian line, the
Message recommends "such liberal contracts
for carrying the mails as will insure their con
tinuauce." These are ominous words?"in
sure their continuance." There is no limit
here to the subsidies that may be required.
But the President says that "an expenditure of
five millions of dollars per annum for the
next five yean, if it would restore to us our
proportion of the carrying trade of the world,
would be profitably expended." The idea,
then, is the recovery of our share of the
carrying trade on the high seas, and to do
this we ara to create a monopoly which will be
in the hands of the favored lines of steamers
supported from the national Treasury, and
for whoso support all their unsubsidized com
petitors, with the people at large, are to be
taxed. In our subsidized railroads, and in our
steamships and telegraphs, and in our banks
and bonds, and from the operations of pro
tective tariffs, and in our monster corporations
in various things, have we not monopolies
enough already ? They "hare increased, are
increasing and ought to be diminished."
In the Message, however, we find a hint
which suggests a way of escape from a gov
ernment of endless subsidies and monopolies
which otherwise threatens us. General Grant
says that "the price of labor in Europe has so
much enhanced within the last few years that
the cost of building and operating ocean
steamers in the United States is not so much
greater than in Europe." Emigration, tho
increased and still increasing cost of labor, of
subsistence, and of coal and iron in England
are in process of a settlement of this question.
If in the meantime we cannot compete with
the shipbuilders of Glasgow there is a shorter
way than that of subsidies for the restoration
of our lost carrying trade?the simple policy
of liberty to our traders to buy their ships
where they can buy them cheapest. But as
some enterprising companies are now engaged
in the construction of a dozen steamships,
more or less, on the Delaware River, Mr.
Kelley, of Pennsylvania, in the House of Rep
resentatives, may protest against this outrage
of admitting foreign-built ships into free com
petition with our home industry. If so, we
can only hope that there are other men in the
House who will still as forcibly protest against
the unjust monopoly expedient of these steam
ship subsidies.
This hot-house system of forcing the growth
of our commerce is at best but a poor device.
It is hardly better?indeed it is worse?than
Mr. Boutwell's Wall street gambling expe
dients for regulating the price of gold. And,
grouping all these inland canal projects
and steamship subsidies recommended or
suggested by the Message, and supposing
thoy are all adopted by Congress, we return to
the very important question, What is the prob
able amount of money that will be required
from the Treasury to carry them through?
The land-locked, seaboard canal proposed be
tween Maine and Moxico possesses what Web
ster would have called "an odor of nation
ality but if peaceful arbitration is henco
forth to be the last appeal of kings we shall
not need this canal for warlike purposes,
and the money required for its construc
tion, which will probably bo all of a
hundred millions, would be better applied in
the work of an interoceanio ship canal across
the Isthmus of Nicaragua or Darien. These
projected Southern Trans-Alleghany canals
would cost each perhaps from fifty to a hun
dred millions; and the Niagara ship canal, to
be of any great value, would hardly be com
pleted with less than twenty-five millions.
Of course in these enterprises, excepting the
Niagara and the Atlantio seaboard canal, the
government would pay only a part of the costs
of construction; but from these examples every
little river, inlet or harbor in the United
States, with any pretences to navigation,
would demand an appropriation from the
Treasury, and would get it, too, through the
Washington lobby, and thus the sum of all those
jobs in the end would be many hundreds of
millions of dollars.
So with these steamship subsidies. If you
subsidize one lino you must, on the rule of
equal rights, subsidize another, and so on till
our whole carrying trade on the high seas and
coastwise and inland becomes a grand monop
oly in the hands of the Secretary of the Treas
ury. For what better right has an ocean
steamer to a government subsidy than a coast
ing schooner or an Erie Canal boat, we should
like to know ? The worst of it is that with the
adoption of these steamship subsidy and canal
jobs a flood of corruptions, frauds and
embezzlements will set in which will swamp
the Treasury and bring upon the country a
ruinous financial collapse, with all its evils of
bankruptcy and repudiation. This is the
abyss which lies at the end of the road to
which the President unwittingly invites Con
gress in the Quixotic government enterprises
wo have been considering. The Message is
remarkable for the prodigality of expenditures
therein recommended in every direction, but
the new departure on those subsidies and in
ternal improvements opens the way for a
policy of endless jobs and endless corruptions,
and for expenditures which can ond only with
the oihaustion of the Treasury.
Congress Yesterday.
In the House evidences were given yester
day of a determination to commence work.
The proceedings, though not in any way ex
citing, brought out some of the old Con
gressional wrestlers on the bill introduced by
Mr. Sohofiold, from the Naval Committee, to
build ton sloops-of-war. It is a fact admitted
on all hands that the ships of our navy,
particularly those vessels on cruising service,
are, in the majority of cases, worthless. Con
structed during the war of unsound timber,
many of these are now absolutely rotten, and
unless something be done to mend matters we
shall find ourselves without sea-going vessels
fit to carry a battery. This proposition to
construct ten hanily vessels is, therefore,
worthy of serious consideration. While de
bating the subject it is well that the condition
of our navy should be fully discussod, in view
of contingencies which, no matter how much
administration men may deny it, are always
possible with a nation having such wido
interests to protect. It our commerce
now is a mere fraction of what it
should be we may reasonably hope that,
sooner or later, it will be worth all the expen
diture whioh Congress may think fit to appro
priate for its protection. But we do not want
money squandered on fleets designed at hap
hazard and built to save appearanoes. What
the country requires is a uniform plan, with
ships of war of the latest and best model,
which will not in a fow yoars in turn require
a jeremiad on their usi-lessness. A resolution
was passed requesting information from
Secretary Boutwell on his authority for the
five million dollar currency reissue of October
last.
The Senate was the scene of a piece of
strategy by Senator Cameron, which resulted
in its immediate adjournment to cnt off a
resolution intended to bo offered by Senator
Fenton, that wheu an adjournment did take
place it would be until to-morrow. The in
tention was to afford a large number of Sena
tors an opportunity to attend the obsequies
of Mr. Greeley. If this latter resolution could
be condemned ou any grounds worthy of
respect, the mode of crushing it was as in
decent as it was stupid. revolt?the loss
of an entire day-rproves the justice of this
opinion. n.c Tnatter how severe it may appear.
The Albany Argus (opposition) concludes
iU review of the President's Message as fol
lows:?"One reflection follows the perusal of
this state paper. We are a great people, and
if let alone and freed from the intermeddling
of government, are sure of a great prosperity,"
Coming from a democratic source, this may be
taken as quite a favorable criticism of an
administration state paper.
The Nobth Carolina. Senators hip.?The
deadlock in the Legislature of the Old North
State consequent upon the difficulties experi
enced in selecting a popular United States
Senator has at length been broken. It will
be remembered that ex-Governor Vance and
Judge Merrimon have both been soliciting the
honor on the conservative side against John
Pool, the republican candidate. For nearly a
week past the struggle has been going on be
tween the contestants, each ballot giving a
different result. All legislation was sus
pended during this conflict At length, after
much bolting and party harassing, Judge Mer
rimon has been elected, the vote yesterday re
sulting as follows:?Vance, 80; Merrimon, 87.
Tub Spmnofeeld Republican, referring to

American republics on this Continent, stretch

A Tribal* to tbe Memory of Horace
Greeley.
The death of Horace Greeley and it* sad
surroundings have touched the heart of the
nation. Eloquent tributes have been paid to
his memory by those who were but recently
his enemies, as well as by his friends, and the
people hinrs shown by their genuine grief at
his loss their appreciation of the value of his
life. It is an old saying that truth is stranger
than fiction. In this memorable instance the
tragedy of real life is deeper and more affect
ing than any that could be drawn from the
realms of imagination.
It seems only yesterday that Horace Gree
ley, full of life and hope, stood before the
American people as a candidate for the high
est office in their gift. For years he had been
known throughout the nation?we might al
most say throughout the world?as a success
ful journalist and an earnest philanthropist.
It would be superfluous now to enlarge upon
his many exoellent qualities and upon the
good he accomplished during his lifetime in
behalf of the weak and the oppressed of all
climes and of all complexions. The last pub
lio honor conferred upon him was his coun
trymen's acknowledgment of his services and
their just tribute to his worth. No ordinary
oitizen could have reaohed suoh distinction.
To-day he has done with earth; its oares,
its toils and its rewards are nothing to him
now. Four weeks ago he followed the remains
of his wife to the grave. To-day he will be
followed by his friends to his own resting
place. He leaves his two young daughters
stricken by a double loss. Their father has been
taken from them before their hearts had oeased
to bleed for the death of a beloved mother.
Their fairy dream of a happy and brilliant
future has indeed been cruelly dispelled.
We propose that the sympathy felt for these
afflicted children shall take a practical shape.
Mr. Greeley has died in very moderate oircum
stances. His estate will leave but an inade
quate support for his daughters. We believe
that the journalists of the United States,
to whom Mr. Greeley's life has been
valuable in its teachings and its example,
will feel a pride in contributing to a
Press Fund for the endowment of
his children. There are a few over
five hundred prosperous daily newspapers in
existence in the United States and over four
thousand five hundred weeklies. Some can,
of course, afford to contribute much more than
others to such an object, but a subscription
averaging only twenty-five dollars each for the
dailies and ten dollars each for the weeklies
would raise an amount of over seventy
thousand dollars. The Herald gladly heads
the list with a subscription of one thousand
dollars, and will be pleased to receive such
contributions to the fund as its contemporaries
may think fit to forward to its care, and will
hand them over to such trusteees as may be
agreed upon by the family and friends of the
deceased journalist. If merchants and others
outside the press choose to unite in this testi
monial to a distinguished, useful and kind
hearted man we shall be happy to acknowl
edge their contributions; but we feel confi
dent that, so far as the press is concerned,
a prompt and generous response will be made
to our suggestion. No more appropriate
tribute eould be offered by American journal
ism to the memory of Horace Greeley than
one which benefits those who were the nearest
and the dearest to him in life.
France?Confidence Restored, bat the
Situation Still Doubtful.
Our news from Franoe this morning con
firms the opinion which we expressed yester
day, that the reconciliation of President
Thiers and his Ministers had for the present
restored confidence in the government and re
assured the Ffench people. Throughout all
her borders France is calm. At the same
time an uneasy feeling prevails as to the pos
sible action of the Assembly on Thursday
first M. Dufaure's motion, which saved
President Thiers, provides for the appoint
ment by the Assembly of a committee of
thirty to draw up a law regulating public
powers and prescribing the conditions of
ministerial responsibility. It is quite natural
that the political parties, and, indeed, the
whole thinking population of France, should
be anxious about the organization of this
committee. Our readers will remember that
M. Dufaure's motion was carried in the As
sembly on Friday last by a very small ma
jority. Everything will depend on the organi
zation of this new committee. The Bight
will do its best to secure a majority in the
committee, and as the Bight is strong nothing
but a willingness on its part to conciliate, if
conciliation is possible, will prevent it from
appointing a committee subservient to its
wishes. If the Bight should succeed, it is not
impossible that there will be another dead
lock on Thursday first. We are not, there
fore, at all surprised to learn that the Rtpub
liq>ie Fran<;aise, a Paris journal devoted to the
cause of tUq Bepublic, is full of fear as to the
result on Thursday, and disposed to believe
that in the event of defeat on the organization
of the committee on that day President Thiers
may consider it his duty to resign, and his
supporters of the Left, following his example,
may withdraw from the Assembly. The situa
tion is thus peculiar. There is quiet for the
moment, and a disposition towards political
party fusion and conciliation is apparent.
France is not unwilling that Presi
dent Thiers and the Assembly, if they can
agree, should continue to rule over them. But
a feeling of uncertainty is general. To-day it
is order; to-morrow it may be chaos. M.
Dufaure's motion was a compromise. It was
the less diffloult for the majority in the As
sembly to allow it to pass, that they knew the
fight must be resumed on the appointment of
the committee. On Thursday first the fight of
Thursday last will be resumed, but with what
results we must wait to loarn.
Tub Albany Journal (administration) in
oommenting upon a Washington statement
th?t the friends of General Qrant in that city
aro annoyed at the intimation that "the eyes
of the administration are on a third term,"
says if this be the fact, then "General Grant
has some silly friends in Washington," add
ing, "It would be just as reasonable for them
to be annoyed at an intimation that he in
tended to make himself king."

Oar VoiantMM Ow Ogfcfc
The response which hu met oar call for
volunteers to Cuba, as proclaimed in Son
day's Hwuld, is a most flattering proof of the
manliness, pluok and ability which are dis
tinctive of the average American. The unfor
tunate withdrawal of our correspondent,
Mr. Henderson, from the sceue of his
duties before the accomplishmcat of his
mission, under the brutal threats of the
Spanish soldiery, has evoked the aspirations
of thousands to take the post of danger who
were, perhaps, until the Sabbath morning,
when the Hkbat.p was laid on the breakfast table
before them, quietly settling plans for a future
of mercantile peacefulness. This is not sur
prising ; the determined men from all classes
who trooped to the Hr.itAi.n office for the
purpose of offering their services were the
stuff that heroes aro made of; men who, no
matter how deeply immersed in business,
turn readily to things which offer
honor as the end of toils, dangers and priva
tions. Those who have watched the alacrity
with which during the late war men of the
most undemonstrative natures and refined
bearing adapted themselves to the rough-and
ready amenities of soldiering with a will,
would not have been astonished to observe
men of this description among the applicants
at the Herald office yesterday and Monday.
Brokers, merchants, lawyers, artists and actors
offered their services, with every guarantee of
good faith. Men who generally float around
when any stir is made ?the professional
revolutionists?were not present in such num
bers as a tyro in such matters would have
expected?there was too great an air of reality
and too little outside show to attract them.
Men from the humbler walks of life, but with
sturdy frames and lion hearts, mingled
patiently in the throng anxious to secure a
post in the Cuban service of the Herald.
Thoughtful men predominated, who ex
pressed their views with the calmness of
true courage, although a number of wild,
hair-brained, devil-may-care individuals called
with all sorts of visionary schemes. Our cor
respondence on the matter, much of whioh,
from its mere quantity, remains yet unex
amined, presents, so far as conned over, the
same mingled characteristics. Of the nation
alities of the volunteers, the names of those
given in the article on the subject published
elsewhere will be a fair indication.
With theso and others noted privately,
the courage of the entire civilized
world was represented. Outside of Ameri
cans, North and South, our adopted citizens
held the largest place. Germans and French
men united in the cause of the Herald. Irish
men, Englishmen and Scotchmen, the former in
largest number, vindicated their respective na
tionalities. The brave children of down
trodden Poland and the sons of Hungary
claimed the opportunity for fame through the
Hebald. Swedes, Itjlians and one Spaniard,
joined with a Greek doctor in the application...
It would, of oourse, be premature to speak of
the tendency of our decision in the matter;
but the patent moral is already visible that
there will be no lack ot first rate materials
for a proper selection.
We cannot with our present information enter
fully into an explanation of the failure of Mr.
Henderson's effort; but the stroigest circum
stances which brought it about and which
have already been published show the diffi
culties which will attend the Hebald
expedition that will take his place. It is cer
tain, however, that the work of examining
impartially and in a spirit of progress and
humanity the workings of this mysterious
warfare will be accomplished. If Cuba has
no knowledge of the mission of a free press it
will be a glorious portion to teach them. None
but moral cowards and the champions of in
vincible ignorance will place obstacles in
the way of its succcss. A Cuban organ of tho
Spanish government, in commenting on the
presence of a Hebald correspondent in the
island, said that if every American journal
sent out a "special" Cespedes could form an
army corps of them alone. The preju
diced writer little know that he was
about to witness the extraordinary fact
of thousands of American citizens volunteer
ing to brave all the dangers, which it brutally
insists should be their lot, in the service of one
journal, and that the paper whose representa
tive it went out of its way to insult. In view
of the encouraging spectacle we feel assured
that there will be a flood of impartial light
thrown on the subject, whose brilliance
Spaniard or insurgent cannot question.
The Police Raid on Policy Dealers*
Of all the sharks who prey upon the poor
and the ignorant in New York none do more
cruel work than the policy dealers. In thoir
little shops, which may be found in almost
every crowded neighborhood where poverty
throngs, they drain, in (limes and quarters,
the earnings of industry, slowly, though
surely, impoverishing their victims and pre
paring them for a career of crime or pauper
ism. With false offers of the chance for large
gains they delude their weak-minded sup
porters. Occasionally they pay a "lucky" cus
tomer, who thenceforth becomes a constant
client, and may bo countod as a sure contrib
utor to the gains of the dealer so long as
there is a dime to invest. But the majority
of the infatuated patrons of this petty schcme
of gambling never win a dollar, yet constantly
indulge the hope that, through some magic
dream or conjuration, they may hit a winning
number and enjoy the possession of money
they have not earned. Hardly a more demor
alizing institution curses this city than policy

it should be faithfully administered. If there
is none, then to frame and pass one should be
an early business of the coming Legislature.
The Elmira Gazette (democratic) does not
think that General Grant will pursue an in
dependent course in his new administration,
and avers that "he must go with the men who
now control him or else he must abandon his
party." Not only his own party, but all other
parties, and rise proudly above partisan cor
ruptions of all sorts. In oarrying out his
ideas of oivil reform he can give the ancicut
party ha*1" of all shades and oolors such a
shaking up as will make their old bones rattle

B*. Stanley'* Vint Lwiut.
The discoverer of Dr. Livingstone appeared
for the first time last evening before a Ne#
York audience to relate from personal e^x?*
rience his views on "Life in Central Africa
and the Horrors of the Slave Trade." The
remarkable feat of journalism which hag aow
passed into history, and which has attracted
the deepest attention, not only of the scien
tifio world, but of the general public too, made
the name of Stanley a household word hero
even before his return to the land of his birth.
Therefore the interest exhibited by the select
and intellectual audience that assembled to
hear his first lecture showed how the Ameri
can public can appreciate the signal triumph
of one of thoir representatives. The interest
ing and lifelike description of the topography
of the Land of the Moon and the sad examples
of man's inhumanity to man alluded to during
the oourse of the lecture gave to the hearem
suoh an insight into the hitherto unknown
regioDS of Central Africa as carried the mind
from Zanzibar to Ujiji, through scenes of
appalling danger and unheard-of suiforing.
There were also on either side of the speaker
objects of interest calculated to fix the atten
tion of the audience upon the subject of the
lecture. On the left was a large map of Central
Africa, showing those regions through which
Livingstone and Stanley wandered, whera
Speke and Grant first beheld the waters of tha
twin lakes, which they named after the
sovereign of England and her lamented spoose,
and where the most wonderful river in tha
world has its source. On the right of tha
speaker's desk were objects still more interest
ing?specimens of the deadly weapons of war
fare with which Mirambo armed his legions
when he sallied forth against the Arabs of Un
yanyembe and when he met the gallant band
from Zanzibar in search of the hero explorer.
There was also the identical American flag
that greeted the eyes of Livingstone when,
sick and faint, "a mere ruokle of bones," ho
had almost abandoned all hope of succor.
Near the glorious Stars and Stripes was the flag
of the Sultan of Zanzibar and folds of tha
cloth whioh may be termed the national
currency of the Land of the Moon.
The dusky Kalulu?the faithful youth- who
accompanied Stanley in his perilous
journey?and the brother of Dr. Livingstone
were also present to lend an additional in
terest to the scene. The earnest manner o!
the lecturer showed a degree of enthusiasm id
his subject that was not lost on the audience.
The names of tribes, kingdoms and towns ol
the newly explored regions fell on ears unused
to them, but the admirable manner in which
Mr. Stanley photographed, as it word, in tha
minds of his hearers the strange, eventful
scenes through which he so triumphantly
passed, made even dry geographical details
| attractive. As he warmed into his subject his
descriptions became more interesting and his
audience more deeply impressed. Barely has
a lecturer been called upon to handle a subject
so difficult and abstruse, and rarely have
efforts in the rostrum been crowned with
similar success. The second lecture of Mr.
Stanley takes place this evening, when he will
relate the interesting history of the march of
the IIkratj) expedition into the Land of the
Moon.
The P?t?'em-oi?-thf-B?ck Policy?In
(ll?n Naaiarre of Settlers.
Commissioner Walker's report on Indian
affairs was satisfactory to a certain extent. It
showed a saving in expenditure and a measure
of progress with the semi-civilized tribe*
located on the skirts of the frontier State*.
But that it demonstrated the wisdom of tho
"peace policy" of the Quaker-evangelical
junta, that from the Bio Grande to Alaska
does for the savage what Mr. Borgh does;
and desires to do, for the lower animals?
that is, interferes to save him from whippings
when he deserves them, and smiles while ha
kicks in his traces?few who know anything
of Mr. Lo will oare to admit. The Indian
question is not yet settled, and never will bo
by periodical manifestoes filled with para
phrases of the Sermon on the Mount. We aro
iuformed by telegraph from San Francisco that
Mr. Commissioner Walker has been afforded
by the Modoc Indians an early opportunity
of correcting some of his more confident
assertions concerning the success of tho
peace policy of the administration. Tho
Modocs having been ordered by tho
authorities to remove to the Klamath reserva
tion in Oregon refused to go; a fight took
place between them and the First cavalry in
consequence, and a number of soldiers and
savages were killed. That was the opening
scene in the tragedy. Now we are told that
the Modocs have massacred all the settlers on
Link Biver and that eighty warriors are in
the field, and are opposed by only thirty-fivs
soldiers from Fort Klamath. The last state*
meut iu tho despatch, that companies are form
ing, is, however, comforting. In the mean
time, however, and before the people of Ore
gon take the settlement of the Modoc diffi
culty into their own hands, it would be well
for Mr. Commissioner Walker to tell us what
he is going to do about it.
The Boston Advertiser (administration) dep
recates the "on to St. Domingo" policy
which some of its contemporaries advocate.
It takes the Philadelphia North American to
task for desiring not only the acquisition of
St. Domingo, but also that of Cuba, tho
Danish West Indies, the Navigator's Islands in
the Pacific, British Columbia, some islands
near Terra del Fucgo and a slice from Mexico.
The Advertiser suggests that if we were not too
proud to take a lesson from Great Britain wo
might gain somothing from her experience.
She is ready to let Canada go in peace.
Australia is becoming accustomed to the idea
of ultimate independence, and her colonies
generally are burdensome to her. The polioy
of wholesale annexation does not seem to bo
popular even among the leading administra
tion papers.
The Buffalo Courier (democratic), in a
leading editorial, confirms the statement
we have already made that a very respeotabio
number of the best newspapers in the country
have recently avowed their independence in
express terms, and the result has been that
they are strengthened with their readers by
the avowal. Among them it names the New
York Tribune, the Springfield Republican, tho
Chicago Tribune, the Cincinnati Enquirer, tho
Missouri Republican and many others of lefs
prominence. The Courier remarks that "a
movement of this kind is certainly gathering
strength throughout tho country, and ii
