RUSSIA ANGRY
AT CHARGE OF
BREAKING PACT
Protest Against Abrogation of
Treaty Causes Sensation
in Washington
Senate Expected to Adopt Reso
lution and Ambassador
May Leave Post
Cabinet Discusses Situation and
Taft Confers With Repub
lican Leaders
WASHINGTON. Dec. 1 5.— pro
test by Russia today against
the abrogation of the treaty
of 1832 with that country in
the form proposed by.the.Sulzer reso
lution, overwhelmingly adopted in ; th©
house of representatives, was followed
tonight by the declaration of senate
leaders" that, in "modified terms, a. reso
lution declaring the treaty at an # end
Would be put through the senate before
the adjournment of that body Monday.
Some senators went so far as to say
that the Sulze-r . resolution, containing
various recitals said to be objectionable
to the St. Petersburg government.
•would-be;adopted without amendment,
. but the consensus of opinion was that
the senate would strip the resolution of
everything but a declaration of abroga
tion.
The point upon, which all seemed to
agree was that the senate "would act
Monday, regardless of any protests that
might be made, and regardless of the
negotiations that have been in progress
between Washington and the Russian
capital. - ' "
Ambassador May Leave
It was reported tonight that if the
eenate should, adopt the house resolu
tion, which boldly declared i that Russia*
had violated her treaty pledges, the
Russian ambassador, George Bakhmet
rff, would ask for his passports and
quit the country. At best. it was said, j
the anibassa-do^wguJ^crait Washing- j
ton "unofficially." leaving an under of
ficial in charge.
It became known that at a Whit*
House conference last nightY Amba«
sador Bakhmeteff expressed both
to President Taft and to Secretary, of
State Knox the view of St. Petersburg,
that the language of the Sulzer reso
lution was objectionable-^ The confer
ence was followed today by _a.second
between President Taft and Secretary
knox. This conference, in turn, was
followed by one between Knox and the
Russian ambassador.
Sensation Created
News of the Russian stand created a
decided senation. The senate was not
in -ion, but there were a number of
hurriedly called conferences, at which
the situation was fully discussed.
Irman Stttser of the house com
on foreign relations said there
■ tiling in his resolution that could
- an insult to ■'sensitive
," and urged the senators to
adopt it without any modification whal-
■ The first stir over the announcement
that Russia had become aroused over
the proposed action of the American
congress in cutting off all commercial
and treaty relations -with that coun
try, and that international complica
tions might ensue, was followed soon
by another thrill, when six members of
the. cabinet 'were summoned to the
White House late in the afternoon.
Officially.»t was stated that the cabinet
had been called in council to pass
finally upon President Taft's message
on departmental affairs, to go to con
gress Thursday. The meeting lasted
for more than three hours.
No Formal Protest Sent
Throughout the day an effort was
made in official quarters to minimize
the importance of the Russian ambas
sador's action.
"Russia has made no formal protest
against the. abrogation of the treaty
or against the Sulzer resolution," ask!
Secretary of State Knox;
The Russian ambassador refused to
discuss the matter in any way. The
ambassador, however, eagerly sought
information as to the probable atti
tude of the senate.
President Taft today sent for several
of the senate leaders*and placed the
matter before them. He is said to
have urged that the resolution of abro
gation be modified. The president, it
was said, had not given up hope that
the negotiations undertaken some time
ago with the St. Petersburg govern
ment would meet with success. The
demand for immediate action by con
srießs had become so insistent that he
wouM n.->t attempt to check it.
Veiled Threat Discussed
Senators and members of the house,
apprised of what many of them char
acterized a = ;( veiled threat by Russia
to tut off all friendly relations with
the United States, discussed the matter
freely.
Republican leaders in the house were
inclined to criticise the democrats for
having required the adoption of the
Sulzer resolution. They had endeav
ored, they said, to have the resolution
amended. When that effort failed.

[Special Dispatch to The Call]
CHICAGO, Dec. 16.—Miss Helen
lyee Brooks, a stenographer In the
office of the Illinois Central sti
perlntendent at Mattoon, 111., is
something of a philosopher.
She has evolved a number of
useful observations between
times when she was not busy
pounding the keys or taking: dic
tation from the bo«».
Here are aome of the principal
ones:
The girl who prldea hersel'
on being a "good fellow"
ought not to complain if the
men in the office take her at
her word.
It is the ambition of some
stenographers to go on the
stage: of others to get mar
ried. None wants to keep on
Just being a stenographer.
As employers some men
are difficult: all women ar«
impossible.
If a girl has tried every
thing else and made a failure
of It, her folks think she'll
make a good stenographer.
A widow begins by "under
standing'" a man; she ends by
marrying him.
If it were not for men.
cooking woulJ become a lost
art.
Some girls think they are
attractive when they are
merely attracting attention.
Some •women marry be
cause they haven't the moral
courage to remain single.
These "rules of conduct" so im
pressed the officials of the rail
road that copies of them will be
posted conspicuously in every

FIVE INJURED IN
POTTER HOTEL FIRE
Women Risk Lives in Effort to
Save Valuables From
$50,000 Blaze
[Special Dispatch to The Call]
SANTA BARBARA; - Dec.Xie:—Fire,
following;, an explosion this afternoon
In the laundry drying room of Santa
Barbara's famous tourist hostelry, the
Hotel Potter, completely destroyed the
hotel annex, with a property-loss of
about $30,000, and for more than *an
hour seriously threatened to wipe out
the main structure. Five persons were
injured during the : conflagration,
while several had narrow escapes from
death.
The hotel property was fully insured,
but most of the hotel servants, who
roomed in the annex, lost all or nearly
all of their clothing and belongings,
including sums of money.
Explosion Blamed
An explosion of gasoline In the.dry
ing room is believed to have caused the
fire, as the. flames broke out just after
a. tailor had "finished cleaning a suit
in the room with gasoline and had
closed the door. About 50 girls were
at work In the laundry at 'the time
and all rushed to safety without' in
jury, but several of them" ran back
into the burning building in an effort
to Kave clothing: and valuables from
their rooms . and were caught in -the
smoke and flames before they could
retreat.
Mrs. Agnes Schultas jumped from a
second story window with her 12 year
old daughter, Marian, in her arms, and
was badly hurt, while the girl escaped
with a few bruises. Hannah Larey
| was nearly suffocated and was saved
I from the building by firemen. Stella
! Rush fractured her left leg by jump
ing from a third story window. John
Dominguez, a fireman, was forced to
jump from a ladder at the height of
the second story and broke his ricrht
la*
Drops Money
Many women eluded the firemen and
made their way into the building.
Minnie Swanson, a waitress, secured
$350 in cash and some jewelry and
other valuables which she had left in
her room, but dropped them in run
ning to save her life. Mrs. Fannie
Cotton, another employe, failed in a
bold attempt to save her property.
"While the fire was at its height all
the guest* were ordered out of the
hotel, and many of them lugged trunk*
and suit ca*es into the open. President
M. M. Potter of the hotel company, his
assistant. E. L» Drury, and many of the
guests of the hotel materially aided
the firemen. The fire was so hot that
the firemen and vohinteers were forced
to work with wet towels around their
heads, and a line was formed to rush
these towels to the worker*.
Mrs. W. K. Dargie, widow of the late
proprietor of the Oakland Tribune, who
is a guest at the Potter, opened a purse
tonight for the girls who were left des
titute by the fire, making a large con
tribution herself and securing a num
ber of other donations. She secured
the promise of the municipal band to
give a concert as a benefit for the em
ployes.
TEMBLOR ROCKS
MEXICO FROM
COAST TO COAST
Violent Shock Causes Panic in
Capital, Where People
Fall in Prayer
Wires Are Snapped and City
Is Without Light or Power
for Time
MEXICO CITY, Pec 15.—Mexico was
rocked from ocean to ocean and from
Guanajuala on the north, and the Isth
mus of Tehuantepec on the south by
an earthquake today.
An old woman was caught between
the walls of a falling house and so
badly injured that she may die. Mrs.
Dora Chenoweth, wife of an American
dentist, is dead as an indirect result of
the earthquake. Fright caused an at
tack of heart trouble.
Two slight tremors, almost imper
ceptible, were registered after the main
shock. One occurred at 2:16 and the
other at tilt.
The disturbance was most severely
felt in the state of Guerrero, especially
in Chilpanzing<->. A few flimsy build
ings were thrown down.
The quake caused a panic here. Hun
dreds of people rushed to the Zoacalo
where they ran aimlessly about or fell
on their knees in prayer. This was
watched by President Madoro with
much apparent enjoyment, for he stood
at a window in the national palace,
laughing. He was conferring with two
of his cabinet members when the first
shock was felt and apparently without
fear he walked to the window over-
looking the Zoacalo, where he remained
until the tremors had ceased.
Telegraph and telephone wires were
snapped, and for a time this city Ml
without light and electric power, but
aside from the throwing down of a few
adobe walls, no serious damage waa
done. The first shock was folt at 12:40
and was continued for four seconds
more than two minutes. The instru
ments registered an oscillatory move
ment from southwest to northeast.
Registered at College
SANTA CLARA. Dec. 16.—An earth
quake of considerable intensity, m
origin SOO miles away and in direction
Z'Z degrees from west to north, was
registered at the Santa Clara college
observatory between 11:20:09 a. m. and
1 p. m. For amplitude and period the

FLOOD THREATENS
MAIN POSTOFFICE
Thousands of Dollars' Worth of
Stamps and Mail Matter
Ruined
Thousands of dollar? worth of stamps,
mall matter and other property in the
United States postofflce in Seventh
street at Mission were destroyed yes
terday afternoon -when the basement of
the building was flooded by the over
flowing of the Seventh street sewer.
For a time the flood threatened to un
dermine the entire building and fear
was entertained for the groat amount
of mail matter on hand.
Not only was tho basement of the
poatofflce flooded, but the basements of
all of the buildings In Seventh street,
and several of those in Mission street
contiguous to the postoffl<"G wore
flooded als ■> The toilets In the base
mrnt of the postoffice as well as those
in the registry department on the
street floor overflowed. The fire in
one of the boilers was put out by the
flood, and had the second fire met with
a similar fate the postofnee would
have been in total darkness last night,
as it is the steam from the boilers in
the building that is used to generate
the electricity used. As it was all of
the lights in the corridors and offices
not used in the active running of the
postomce department were turned off
to lighten the burden on the live
boiler.
The flood was flrat noticed in the
postoflfice basement about 5 o'clock.
Postmaster Fisk and Assistant Post
master Burke directed the saving- of
the mail matter in the basement. When
it was feared that the Building would
be thmvvn into total darkness orders
were given to have the registered and
special delivery mail matter immedi
ately transferred to the vaults.
The flood increased until the entire
basement of the building- was covered
to & depth of several inches.
300,000 NAMES

CHURCH CENSUS
1,200 Workers Endure Rains to
Gather Data for Re=
ligious Work
Christmas Shoppers Absent
Yesterday to Be Reached
This Week
Between 275,000 and 300,000 residents
"f San Francisco were reached yester
day by the volunteer workers engaged
in the house to house church census,
which began at 1 o'clock in the after
noon. The weather retarded the work,
but it will be continued Monday and
Tuesday, when a. full report may be
made on the religious affiliations of
the people of this city.
No figures were available last even-
Ing: as to the church membership of
the Han Franciscans, but aa fast as
the returns come in they will be tabu
lated and reported to the public.
Brerjr denomination of the city was
represented in the work, which was
under the direction of C. R. Fisher,
chairman of the visitors' committee.
Twelve hundred workers were in the
field. In the thirty-fifth assembly dis
trict, in the heart of the Mission, 25,
--0"0 persons were tabulated and in the
thirty-third district between 8,000 and
10,000 were enumerated by the census
takers. But both the elements and the
season were agrainst rapid work, for
the rain interfered with the enumer
ators and the Christmas shopping sea
son took many women away from their
homes, making it impossible to secure
information.
The work of the census has been un
dertaken to enable the churclues and
clerryßMFfl of the city to learn some
what accurately how many persons at
tend church and how many have de
nominational preference but for some
reason or other are not affiliated with
any congregation. After the census has
been taken and the figures given to the
public, tho pastors of the churches will
be supplied with the names and ad
dresses of tiiose amon^ u.'ium they
might work.
The census has been taken in other
cities with .great success and it is an
ticipated that good results will follow
the work here. Interested in the can
vass are all of the Protestant denom
inations, the Roman Catholic clergy
men, who are co-operating with the full
approval of 'Arenbishop Rlordan, the
Jewish rabbis and others. The scope
of interest in the work is indicated by
the list of clergymen and others who
comprise the advisory committee. The

IN BITTER OUTBREAK
Olaf A. Tveitmoe, secretary of the
State Building Trades council, loom
ing a-8 an important witness in the
Ijos Angeles federal grand jury's in
vestigation of the nationwide dyna
mite conspiracy, arrived in San Fran
etaco last evening under imperatives
instructions to present himself before
the jurors when they reconvene to
morrow. Antone Johansen, organizer
in the same labor association, also is
commanded to appear before the jury
in Los Angeles.
Both men, returning from the east
on the Overland limited, were served
with subpenas by deputy United"States
marshals at Sacramento yesterday aft
ernoon, and both accepted service
grimly and both uttered defiance of
the forces they designated as oppress
ors of labor. Each declared that IM
had nothing to fear personally from
the fullest investigation, and each—
Tveitmoe white with rage and trem
bling with anger, Johansen low voiced
and suppressed—refused to discuss hia
own connection with any phase of the
Inquiry.
Detectives Always Near
Apparently Tveitmoe and Johannsen
returned alone; actually, they were un
der surveillance of secret service agents
of the government who relievcl tlio
operatives of the Burns Detc-, tivp
agency of that work when the Govern
ment supplanted the state in its inves
tigations. Tveitmoe asserted that the
detectives had been at his elbow for a
considerable time and that neither he
nor Johannsen #ould have escaped even
had they desired to do so.
Mayor P, H. McCarthy and Andrew
J. Gallagher, secretary of the Pan
Francisco Labor council, greeted Tveit
meo and Johanscn at thf Ferry build
ing. The greetings were effusive and
McCarthy piloted Tveitmoe. to a tat
riage, which whilred them to the of
fices of the Building Trades council.
Johansen was escorted to the Sausalito
ferry, where lie started for his home at
Corte Madera, His daughter Lauretta
died while her father was in the en si
and the funeral had been postponed
until his return. .Tohans^n will go to
Los Angeles after her funeral.
Several labor leaders assembled at th«
Oakland mole long before the overland
arrived. Among them were A. E. Yoell
of the Asiatic Exclusion lague, in which
Tveitmoe has been the principal power,
and Francis Drake, a labor writer. As
Tveitmoe left the train these men seized
him enthusiastically, while J. B. Bowen,
acting president of the building trades:
William Cole, an organized of the coun
cil, and A. G. Gilson. its assistant sec
retary, followed them. E. B. Morton of
the Millmen's union greeted Johansen,
also a member of the Millmen's union,
and stayed by his side through the trip
across the bay.
Tveitmoe the Central Figure
Tveitmoe, however, was the central
figure. About him the crowds at the
mole, on the ferryboat and at the ferry
building swarmed and jostled. He was
surrounded by a cordon of his friends,
and after reaching the lower deck f
