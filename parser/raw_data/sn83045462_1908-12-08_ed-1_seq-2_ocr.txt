employers' liability law shou'd be passed
for the District of Columbia."
Labor in Politics.
The President attacks in no uncertain
. language organized labor for its attitude
ih the last election. He says:
"Organized labor made a violent and j
sweeping attack upon the entire judiciary !
of the country?an attack couched :n sUch j
terms as to include the most upright, hon- I
est and broad-minded judg a no less than ;
those of narrower mind and more re- ;
stricted outlook." ]
He goes on to explain the demands of
organized Jabor in regard to the injunction
and decries it as "a policy which, if
carried out. wou'd mean the enthronement
of class privilege in lta crudest and
most brutal form and the destruction of
one of the most essentia! functions of the
judiciary in all civilized lands."
He congratulates the laboring men of
the country for the way in which they
reoudiated the effort to get them to cast
their votes in response to an appeal to
class hatred, "in doing: which they emphasized
their sound patriotism and
Americanism."
The President follows with a long dissertation
upon the practices of judges;
with praise of the good Judge and depre,
cation of the unjust Judge He scores
demagogic Judges. corpo^atton-ridden
judges and the like, and says;
"The courts ane to be highly commended
and stanohly upheld when they set
their faces against wrongdoing or tyranny
by a majority, but they are to be
blatnOd when tht-y fall to "r-cognize under
a government like ours the deliberate
Judgment of a majority as to a matter of
legitimate policy when duly expressed by
the legislature. Such lawfully expressed
and deliberate judgments should be given
efTect by the courts, save in the extreme
and exceptional cases where there has
been a clear violation of a constitutional
provision."
The President raps Congress hard for
the framing of the employers' liability
law of 190B, which was declared unconstitutional
by the Supreme Court.
Conservatiok of Resources.
A large portion of the message is given
up to an appeal for the protection of the
forests and for the conservation of the
I natural resources. Fie cites the experience
of China, other Asiatic countries.
Africa and Mediterranean Eu ope in deforestation,
with the deplorable results
. that followed, and makes an earmst plea
! for the protection of our own forests as
a measure of national conservation.
"When the for: sts jgo man goes," he
t ??re. and cites history to prove it.
The message dials with carious subI
jects of internal, policy, public health.
the census, etc.; approves the parcels
post, postal savings bank, the pure food
law, denatured alcohol, etc.
He recommends placing the government
printing office und'.r the jurisdiction of
the Department of Commerce and Labor,
and says:
"At present this office is under the com^
bined control, supervision and admlnisV.
trative direction of the President and of
the joint committee on printing of the
two houses of Congress. The advantage
of hiving the employes' In this 'dfflce
and the expenditure of the $5,761.377.57
appropriated therefor supervised by an
executive department is obvious, instead
of the present combined supervision "
The President recommends $he immediate'
admission of Arizona and New
Mexico as separate states. He urges the
fortification of Hawaii, harbor improvements
and other appropriations. He
urges American citizenship for the people
of.^ Porto Rico, congratulates the
Cubans upon the early withdrawal of
American control,., but warns them to be
careful in their, self-government.
He commends the Filipinos, urges them,
to continued efforts toward self-government,
but serves notice that they cannot
have it until they show themselves fit.
Army and tf&vy Reform.
The President has some positive views,
upon promotion In the army and navy,
which he sets forth at. length. They
must fee read in'lull In efder'ta fee fairly
described. For instance,^ In reg&rd to the
asy^ejsays: -# ?%* t >
' "Our men come too .old and stay for1
too it&rt a time in $ae hig]|Mpmmand
positions." .
- As to the aronii be flraUts tpliie presoaRs^iS^fftgl!
many men of mediocre .capacity, who
have hat a short time to serve. .
The President makes a pointed drive a(
Congress for a provision inserted in an
appropriation bill in the last session prohibiting
details from the secret service
and transfers therefrom. The President
in a heated tone disapproves of this provision,
and Intimates that it only serve? to
protect criminals.
In an exceedingly caustic vein he says;
"I do not believe it is In the public
interest to protect criminals in any
branch of the public service and, exactly
as we have again and again during the
past seven years prosecuted and convicted
such criminals who were in the
executive branch of the government, so In
my belief we should be given ample
means to prosecute them if found in the
legislative branch.
"But," he goes on to say with fine sarcasm,
'If this is not considered desirable
a special exception could be made in the
law prohibiting the use of the secret service
In Investigating members of Congress."

MISSING SIKCE HIS WEDDING
POLICE ASKED TO FIND. MBS.
THOMPSON'S HUSBAND.
Unheard From Since Obtober 21,
t
When He Left Her to'Go to
Scarsdale, Pa.
Mrs. Kredda Thompson, of Virginia,
who Is visiting relatives at the Wicomico
apartment house, in New Jersey avenue
northwest, asked the police yesterday
afternoon to locate her husband,
l.eonard Thompson who, she says, left
her at the Union station October 21 and
has failed to return to her. According
to the story Mrs. Thompson told the police
of the sixth precinct she was married
to Thompson in Frederick, Md., October
20. He had resided at Leesburg.
Va., and she at Luekett, Loudoun county,
Va. They had known each other since
childhood.
The young couple had planned to reside
in Baltimore, and the day following the
wedding they came to this city, intending
to go to Scarsdale, Pa. At the station the
groom told his young bride that as he
had business to attend to in Scarsdale
and would return to Baltimore in a Huv
or so it would be best for her to spend a
few days with her relatives in the Wicomico.
She a;rreed and kissed him poodbye
as he took a train for Scarsdale.
She then went to the home of her relatives.
No letters came from the young
husband until November 3, when theyoung
wife heard that he would return
to her the following day.
The train upon which he was supposed
to be a passenger came into the I'nion
station, and the young bride was disappointed
because it did not bring her husband.
A month passed, and as no word
has been received from Thompson the
wife thought it was about time to ask
the police to locate him.
Mrs. Thompson believes that her husband
was returning to Washington, when
he met with some injury and has been delayed.
and she is anxious that the police
put forth extra effort to find him.
Mrs. Thompson, who was formerly Miss
Fredda Ayres. has a mother and several
brothers who live at Luckett, Va. Her
father died some years ago.
The Eternal Feminine.
From the Wide World Magaslne.
Among some African tribes, when a
man professes his love for a woman and
asks her in marriage, she invariably refuses
him at first, lest it should appear
that she had been thinking of him and
was eager te become his wife. By so
doing she maintains the modesty of her
ex. as well as tests the love and abases
* the pride of^her lover.

brary yesterday to cut down and eondense
the mass of information at its disposal
previous to presenting it to the
Joint conference this afternoon.
The southern commercial congress held
its night meeting at the New WiUard last
night. There was a large attendance.
Important speeches were delivered by
Gifford Pinchot, the chief forester, and
Frank 8. Washburn of Tennessee.
Mr. Pinchot said that the forests of the
Appalachian range were naturally great
hardwood repositories. These were being
wasted by bad cutting and iires and
were not being thinned and replanted as
they should be. He said the for sts were
capable of raising fifty cubic feet of new
wood per acre each year and that under
present conditions they were not producing
ten. He spoke also of the vast
water power at the disposal of the people
in this region.
Preliminary to the convening of their
morning session. G. Grosvenor Dave,
secretary of the Commercial Club of
Montgomery, A'a., called attention to the
wrong impression which has gained considerable
headway in foreign countries,
notably in Europe, regarding the health
conditions in the southern states.
Declaring that In northeastern Europe
and the British Isles the itnm grant maps
have black and ye low splotches over what
are called the southern states, the idea
being that certain southern states are Infected
with yellow fever and therefore
unfitted for a place of residence. Mr. Dawe
said this impression is unjust to the south.
He therefore advocated the carrying on
of an active propaganda in foreign coun- g|
tries to make the south better understood K
in this respect. e,

Every indication points to the largest
waterway convention ever held in this
country for the purpose of emphasising J
upon the Congress of the United States
the crying need for a broad and comprehensive
policy toward the rivers, har- j
bors and canals of the United States.
To impress upon the nation's legislators
that the country is aroused for a
fixed waterway policy the fifth national
convention of the national rivers and harbors
congress will meet at 10 o'clock tomorrow
in the grand assembly room of
the New Willard, Representative Ransdell

gress. officiating. p
Cardinal Gibbons will deliver the iovocation,
to be followed by Vice President

The convention, which begins tomorrow

The lead was divided among eight teams

It became known shortly after noon that i,
Victor Dupre, of one of the French teams,
was ill. He was last seen on the track b
at 7:20 this morning. Leon Qeorget, his o
partner, clung to the leaders during the c
long grueling hours of the morning. Dur- fl
ing the occasional sprints he held his h
place and appeared to be going as strong t!
as ever at 1 o'clock. It was considered ?
Improbable that he would be able to hold ?
his place among the leaders, should the j,
other riders decide to start short sprinting,
as he had been on the track ior neariy |]
seven continuous hours, while the other h
men had been frequently relieved. f
At 11 o'clock Faber of the French team c
picked up a lap on the other riders, but
had a hard time holding it until the 0

set. f
During the early hours of the second
day, Lawrence Waterbury, the polo .
player, offered a prizj of $300 to the I
rider who could first gain a lap on his '

steal the coveted distance, but Mr. Waterbury
left the garden with his $300 still *

NEW YORK. December 8.?A supreme pi
est was successfully met by the high ^
ressure water system this morning. The w
ituatlon was handled with only half the d<
lumps working, too.
There was a fire In the seven-story tfl
uildtng at 152-154 Franklin street. So
ercely did it lay hold of the structure te
t the outset that the flremen were sure Ia
fifth alarm would have been necessary
nder the old system In order to get re
nglnea enough to pump a sufficient quan. ln
Ity of water. **
The Are was handled without engines.
l second alarm complement turned out, **
ut the engines were sent home. tf
In their stead fifteen lines, attached to dl
hree pumps, half of the number which fc
upply the district, sent into the inferno o1
f flame 7,200 gallons of water a minute, 111
r 432,000 gallons an hour. In addition
? this the flames were kept from geting
into two tall whisky houses flanking
tie building at the east and the west. pi
It was the biggest fire New York had w
een in many moons. And the way the ?e
igh pressure flooded the bed of fire made
tie heart of Chief Croker glad. tri
bi
Few Five-Alarm Fires. oi
The fire was devoid of much pictur- P*
squeness which would have obtained
ad it been an old-style fifth alarm. 37
here haven't been many fifth-alarm th
res, comparatively speaking. The fire ^
1 the Parker building on 4th avenue, B
rhere three flremen perished, was about
tie last of the fifth-alarm affairs. in
It meant the turning out of a score of b
ngines and the moving of many other m
nglnes to cover the points left uncovered w
y those companies which toad gone to the el
re. It meant that for blocks around
he neighborhood of the burning building
here were throbbing, spark-spouting ma. cr
hines with polished nickel stacks, and qt
hat the roadways were webbed with hose p{
rhich often burst, sending geysers Into
he air. in

Night Watchman Thomas Townsend, ^
ust before the discovery of the Are, heard w

there there are elevators. .Looking te

He gave the alarm at 4:11 o'clock. Just te

It is a hazardous district to keep the w

The government Is showing by its

A long string of patent office employes

Physicist Wardman on Stand.
Dr. Charles W. Wardman, associated
iiyslclst of the bureau of standards,
as put on the stand this morning. Three
tters to him from Ned W. Barton show
lat Barton had communicated with the
jreau regarding electric lights, and in
ie letter was mentioned that he exacted
to get some lamps from Heany.
Harry O. Cutting, assistant examiner In
e patent office, at one time in division
'. and an acquaintance of Barton, was
ie next witness.
He was brought in by the government
icause he claimed to be familiar with
arton's handwriting.
He testified that some of the handwritg
on the patent papers in the case was
arton's. The cross-examination for
ost of these witnesses regarding handrltlng
has been in the nature of an
aboration of the question.
"Are you a handwriting expert7"
As none is, the defense grinds out the
oss-examination to the finest point, inlirlng
as to each individual letter and
irts of letters.
The testimony is, therefore, uninterestr
The jury looks bored to death when
set of questions similar to this one
put:
"You have seen a great many "B's"
ritten in your life; tell the jury
herein this 'B' differs from Barton's.'
This question would be generally foliwed
by others of the same charac:r.
Some of these witnesses?laymen
-with no pretense of being experts,
ave been subjected to half an hour
f constant drilling along this line. OcLsionally
the dull gray of the gloomy
istimony has been streaked with the
ar'et of a little battle between attorneys.
This morning Attorney Geddings and
istrict Attorney Baker took to obicting
and handing out statements adressed
to neither court nor witness,
jdge Gould asked them to desist, say"Gentlemen,
if you wish to address
ie court, rise in your proper places,
s you are, it is difficult to tell
hether you are paying personal comliments
to each other or not."
Barton Destroyed Papers.
Charles A. Tullar, an assistant in dision
37 of the patent office, testified
lat two or three days before the in
ctment of Ned Barton was returned
arton destroyed certain papers In his
*sk. He also connected Barton's name
lth Heany, saying that Barton had
orked on some electrical matters at
eany's request.
Another assistant examiner from the
atent office, David C. Davis, testified
lat Barton got mail from the defendant
verding, and that Barton filled up their
>mmon waste basket with papers which
e tore up three days before Barton's lnIctment.
The witness was led up to the point ot
illing what papers Barton had destroyed,
nd then, to the great amusement of the
?fense. gave a detailed account of flndg
in the waste basket a catalo ue of
jtomobile tires and rubber buckets.
George B. Jones, assistant examiner of
ivision, was on the stand about three
lnutes, corroborating the previous testlony
regarding mail to Barton.
William A. Coles, a principal examiner
i the patent office, and once in division
', gave testimony which had a slight
?arlng on the question of al eged for;ry
in some of the letters. He was not
oss-examined.
Mrs. Helen G. Gow, public stenographer
id typewriter, with an office at 3226
hestnut street, Philadelphia, was the
ivernment's witness in a bit of testiony
to bear out the contention that cerln
papers were taken from the patent
nee files and others substituted, in or>r
to secure one or both of the patents

ritten some specifications for Everdlng,
it said those appearing in the files now

Special Dispatch to The Star.
NEW YORK. N. Y., December 8.-Perhaps
the cheekiest thing, to use slang,
that ever was proposed to an organized
base ball league is the petition which has
been sent from Cleevland asking the
American League to Are Joe Cantillon out
of the organization. Cleveland assumes
to run the whole American League, merei
*_ ? a i /ti i a ^ _ _ _ _
ty oetauae me Lieveiano tana nave a
quarrel with the Washington club, taking
the ground that it was through the refusal
of Washington to play Delehanty
last year that Cleveland was kept out of
the pennant.
To hear the conversation of some of
the Cleveland fans who by some strange
luck happen to be here at the same time
as the American League meeting one
would believe that Joe Cantillon is the
Mephistopheles of base ball, and that If
he is not removed from the game, Clevgland
will voluntarily absent itself from
all contests which are played In that city
next summer In which the Washington
club is engaged
Nationals Sure to Draw.
That may be the idee which the Cleveland
fans entertain, but it Is dollars to
cents that about 3.000 of them will be
inspired with curiosity to see whether
anybody else goes to the game, and by
ithe time that they are aliassembled
Washington will not be without a crowd
to see it. This petition from Cleve.and,
which actually exists, is said to contain
about 1,500 names. Ban Johnson does
not know what to do with It. It Won't
make an ornament for the. office ot the
American League In Chicago, and iti
can't be of use for copy paper. In spite
of the fact that it is so long. It recites
all manner of things against Cantillon,
and Is as vengeful as the threats of the
New York fans not to patronise the Chicago
and Brooklyn, clubs next year, first
because the fans don't think that Murphy
1? a good wort, and second, because
Ebbete of Brooklyn voted to take away,
that protested game from the New York
team. *
Not only do the Cleveland fans want
Cantillon put out of base ball for good,
but they are after Eag&n, the umpire.
They don't know a reason why he
should be retained by the American
League owners, and) Insist that he be1
banished to the minora.
Eagan the Goat.
Poor Eagan Is in New Yofk. and oaa't
see why he should be' made a goat to
suffer for all the sins of the American
League.
Ban Johnson probably will not make a
serious matter of the Cleveland protest.
Such protests are usually serio-comic
rather than otherwise, and the Cleveland
document will go the way of hundreds
which have gone before.
There are some of the American League
oeople who have not made their appearance
here, although ail of them will unquestionably
be on hand by this evening.
The Cleveland crowd were a little lata
in arriving and they were kidded unmercifully
about being afraid to come to*
the city when they knew that the "Big'
Letter" would precede them. There really
is not very much for the American
League people to do today except to
hobnob with their neighbors, and to make
any trades which may bob up in case
there is an opportunity to do some trading.
Minors in Good.
The requests of the American Association
and the Eastern League have been
received most favorably all along the line,
and it is the general opinion that both
of the Class A minors will get what they
are after.
There seems to be no particular reason
why they should not. They have not
asked anything which is out of the way
and if the national commission is restrained
from giving them a little liberty
by reason of the opposition of the major
lsagues, which is expressed through the
commission, there Is not much doubt but
the minors will pull out and go It alone.
The correspondent of The Star is in
a position to say that this will almost
certainly be done. In an interview
which was of a confidential nature and in
which the minor league representative*
were concerned it was stated flatly
that they would not put up any

been enforced over them by trolley
leagues.
No Thought of Fight.
"We shall not make the slightest disturbance
in base ball circles," said they.
"There will be no fighting, no contract
breaking, nothing which will be out of
the ordinary, but we will not be managed
by a coterie of men who have
only a few cents Invested, where our
plants are now costing us thousands of
dollars. That Is flat, final and certain."
A brother of Ed Walsh, the Chicago
spitball pitcher, came over to sign his
contract with Comlskey, for Comiskey
has him on the reserve list for next
year.
"Nothing doing," said Comlskey.
"We never sign contracts until about
two months from now, and then wg
hook everybody up at once."

as he is finished he will slide over to New
York to see his friends, providing that any
of them are left behind.
Clarke Griffith left for his house up on
Washington Heights late yesterday afternoon,
sanguine that when he met HerrI
mann this afternoon he would be the next
manager of the Cinelnnatis.
