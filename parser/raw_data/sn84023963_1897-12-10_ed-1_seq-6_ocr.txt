there leen a favorable feature in har
condition. That the attack would
ultimately end in death was th first
fear of the family on discover! hj her
lines and the consultation of the
attending physicians have fended
to confirm this belief.
.Mother" McKinley must have been
atrikeu some time during Wednesday
Bight, but the first intimation she had
of any change in her condit.on nss
thin morning wheu she found her
aelf unable to apeak. .she walked
to the room of her daughter aud
aroused the latter. At once Miss M -Kinley
saw that something had hap
pened. She awakened the other mem
bers of the family and a physician was
cal.ed. He at once pronounced the
trouble paralysis.
"Mother" McKinley had been slight
ly ill for several days with a mihi at
tack of the grip. She had been up aud
abo-it the house, and no serious results
from her illness were apprelieuded.
Her aon Abner McKinley, of New
York, arrived in C anton on Tuesday,
and his mother seemed to be greatly
cheered by his presence. Yesterday
abe was ao bright and cheerful as to
cause the family to remark on her im
provement. Mr. McKinley aajing he
had not aeen his mother looking ao well
for a number of years. That beiug
her conditiou when she retired last
evening, the blow to the family upon
discovering what had come upon her
duriutf lh- night was a sad one. Dur
ing the forenoon a letter from the
president was received. It waa read
to the aged sufferer and in response to
questions if abe understood its con
tents she nodded assent
Mr. Abner McKinley communicated
with the president as soon as he
learned the serious nature of the ill
ness of his mother, and the president
asked that he le advised immediately
of auy change. Appointments were
made for communication by telephone,
and telegram-, were also exchan,;, 1
fi quently. S.ion after Mr. Abner
McKinley not. tied the president that
the sufferer had relapsed into semi
consciousness, and promised to com
niun ii-aie further at ti o'clock. The
president did not wait for the five
oVl'N-k message. He responded:
Tell mother I will be there," and at
once prepared tostart for Canton. He
is expected to arrive here at ten o'clock
to-morrow morning.
Dr. Phillip, wheu he saw the pa
tient at aix o'clock this evening, had
little to add to what he had already
aaui. to the effect that she waa very
III and stood but little chance of re
covery. It was the opinion of the doc
tor that she could not last more ttian
a few days and tue cud might come at
auy time.

master (ieueral Perry S. Heath, has is
sued the following circular regarding
th rural postal free delivery.
"The ultimate success of the experi
ment of free delivery of mail, which ia
now being tried, by direction of
congress, iu 50 rural districts of
the United States, will depend largely
upou the promptness with which the
carriers caa make their deliveries to
the patrons on their routes. Thia
will be greatly facilitated if
those desiring to take advantage of
rural free delivery will erect suitable
boxes by the roadside, in which car
riers may deposit mails as they pass,
and from which they may collect the
mails intended for transmission. The
time which would otherwise be con
sumed by carriers io reaching resi
dences some distance back from the
road will thus be aaved, the service
will be rendered more efficient, ita coat
will lie reduced and the probability of
its becoming a permanent feature of
the postal administration will be increased.

us quickly as if it were oiied tinder.
In less than IS minutes after the tire
waa discovered the ttamea had pierced

waa much dauger of the adjacent

, the cry of fire was given, went down

w hu h attracted such atteuttou some
mouths ago, by calliug for the resigna
tion of Clark.
u April II laat Clark waa ousted
from the quarters used below as the
United States cousular ofth-cs and
above as a residence. It was stated at
the time that the consulate had beeu
sacked, the house plundered audau id
diguity put upon the goveruiueut
through its representative. The state
department promptly called upon Mr.
Clark for particultrs, which he said he
would furuish. The Peruvian minister.
Senor Egillguren, put u differ
ent phase ou the matter by
submitting a statement thai Ularh was
in arrenil le a considerable amount on
rent for building: ttiat only the lower
portion was used for consu lar purp. ses.
although he had placed the United
Mates co.it of arms on al I doors of the
house, thus using the American em
blem for ignoble purposes.
The courts had given regular decree
against Clark, it was staled, directing
him to vacate the premises for non
payment of rent, and in pursuance ol
this decree he was ejected.
Secretary Miermau waited until re
cently for Mr. Clark's statement, uud
aa this was not furnished after five
months, the secretary directed our
minister at Lima. Mr. Dudley, to call
ou Clark for his resignation unless the
proofs of the alleged sack. ng were iu
hand. Mr. Dudley evidently had not
the proofs, for he has notified the state
department that he has called ou Mr.
C iark for his resignation.

To a modest, sensitive, hi(jh

patients heeded their symptoms in time. (
If a young- girl's blonl is watery, her ekin
pale and waxy looking, her lips colorless, bowels
torpid, digestion poor, her ears and temples throb and
he is subject to headache, begin at once to build up her
system with Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
Do not allow her to undergo a physical examination.
Here is a letter from a young lady who requests that
her name should not be used, but gives her initials and
street number so Lnatt any inquiry addressed to her
will be received. She says:
" Dear Mrs. Pinkham: -It affords me great pleasure to be able to say a fen
words in regard to the merits of your Vegetable Compound. I was tempted
to try it after seeing the effects of it upon my mother, and now I feel like a
new person. I am a stenographer and was troubled with falling of the womb
and lemale weakness in general. I continued to work until I wns so weak I
could no longer walk, and the laet dny I was forced to stop nnd rest
MI was then so ill that I waa compelled to stay In hod and so nervous
that I could not hold anything in my hands. The lenst noise or surprise
tennMonnM my heart to beat so loudly, nnd I would become so weak that I
could hardly stand. I suffered for almost a year. It ti different now. I
can go altout my work with pleasure, while before, work was adrudgn,
"Trusting tlint my words of praise may help some other afflicted person,
and be of benefit to womankind in general, I remain, Yours in gratitude,
