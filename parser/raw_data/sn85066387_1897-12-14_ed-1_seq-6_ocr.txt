QUESTIONS THAT MUST BE ANSWERED.
THE Citizens 1 Committee of One Hundred, having in hand
a reform charter and a reform ticket for Freeholders, is to
be congratulated upon tbe pure atmoipherc in which it is
prosecut its work. Its newspaper supporter lias now been
convicted of accepting money from ihe railroad on an "adver
tising" contract in which there was a stipulation for thirty
months of editorial silence; of theft in stealing an eariy copy
of this paper from is pressroom; of falsifying a dispatch to
which was signed the name of Captain Tuttle of lbs revenue
rutter Bear, and of attempting to injure The Call by dissemi
nating a libelous circular under a counterfeit designation.
Yet this journal is the organ of the Committee of One
Hundred and is leading its campaign for a form" charter.
It is the instrument which the committee has chosen for
printing the literature of its cause, and in behalf of the com-
mittee charter it everyday libels somebody and brings reproach
upon the city and its citizens.
The Committee of One Hundred is composed mainly of
business men. Many ol Its members own property in San
Francisco, and all entertain a greater or less interest in the
character and future of the city. Do these gentlemen wish the
public to understand that they have accepted the ifa tership
of the Mission-street boodier and slanderer? If the Examiner
were on individual who could be prosecuted criminally it
would now be in jail for blackmail, petty larceny, forgery and
libel. Do the members of the committee desire the public to
think that blackmail, forgery and libel are the moving forces
in their efforts to secure a new charter for San Francisco? If
they do not— and we are forced to believe that they do not—
why do they permit the Examiner to represent them in this
contest?
Do they think their cause is going to be promoted by such
an advocate? If so, why do they not apply to Warden Hale of
Ban Quentin prison fcr more moralists capable of presenting
their case to this community? The San Qtentin bastile
abounds with men unequal to the task of holding up a railroad
corporation, stealing copies of newspapers to obtain news, fal
sifying telegraphic dispatches, or eire tinting libelous circulars
to damage the business of r.vais and defame a whole city.
We are informed that the Merchants Association is largely
responsible for creating the Committee of One Hundred. Mayor
Thelan is said to have appointed the latter at the request of the
officers ot that association. What answer has the Merchants'
Association to make to the foregoing questions? Does Mr.
Dohrmann or Mr. Freud accept the leader hip of the Mission
street baodler in this contest ? Dj they think blackmail, for
gery, larceny and libel nre legitimate instrumentalities for ef.
fecting reforms in organic law? Are they proud of their con
nection with the Examiner?
The people of San Francisco demand answers to these
questions. On every side we hear them speculating upon the
fusion which has been consummated between the Merchants'
Association, the Committee of One Hundred, the Buckley
Democrats and the Examiner. The sentiment -rally ex
pressed is en? of ouz'tnent. An alliance between th« same
gentlemen and the Police Gazette could not occasion more won
der. Can it be possib c that the charter-makers of the Citizens'
Committee are so blind as not to see that the moral gorge of the
city is going to rise against any charter advocated by the
Mission-street blackmailer? Are they unable to see whence
their association is Jeadin.-' them ?
THE HAWAIIAN PROBLEM.
THE Chronicle attempts to retrieve the position lo3t by its
admission lhat failure of the annexation treaty carries
with it the failure of exclusion from the United States of
the Hawaiian Asiatics. That paper says now that "the power
to regulate the goings and comings of these people will not be
lost to Congress by the failure to define it in a formal treaty
with Hawaii." end that "it is practicable to pass a special Ter
ritorial law cover; t g their case."
Will the Chronicle please point out the clause in the Federal
constitution, the deci-ion of a court or the precedent in our
legislative history that justifies the prohibition of freedom of
all our territory lo the inhabitants of any part thereoi?
This issue i* part of the whole problem involved in the
future political status of the islands, if annexed. They are to
come not as a State, nor are they to pa-s a Territorial novitiate.
Their complex affairs require a plainly defined government
with legislative, executive and judicial powers. The widtn of
lhe departure from our system cf government is exposed in
such admissions as the Chronicle makes. It is certain that no
eminent constitutional lawyer has yet found any standing in
our fundamental law for the po itical system necessary lor
Hawaii as part of our domain.
The Chronicle indulges in some mild child's play when it
talks about Hawaii draining off our Chinese labor because
wages are better in the islands than here.
Herelofore he Chronicle has published that even the Portu
guese laborers in Hawaii were paid only $6 per month, and
Americans and Scandinavians only $10 per month. On such a
scale the wages of Chinese must be "out of sight" indeed!
The Chronicle in the same connection admits tbat the island
planters must have Asiatic labor to work their cane fields and
insists that they must seek it in California.
We have said that this republic cannot afford to incor
porate with it any country in which American labor cannot
exist. The foundation an 1 structure of our system of govern
ment is a laboring population, out of which are drawn the
men who make and administer our institutions. If the Chron
icle is telling the tru h it is our witness to the fact that Hawaii
lacks and must forever lack this element necessary to the life
of the republic By its own statement Hawaii is by nature
suited to two distinct classes, which cannot assimilate. The
members of one cannot enter the other. The line between them
must remain forever distinct and impassable. The land-own
ing planter and the laboring coolie are to stand there in the
relation of baron and serf.
The present Chinese population of California, unrequit
able under our exclusion lawi and non-family rearing is
terminable by mortality. When this generation passes it will
disappear, lf, as is insisted, the island planters must now re
sort here for their supply of Asiatic labor, what will they do
when mortality terminates that supply?
Herein is "the peculiar condition," the "needs of labor"
referred to in the President's message. When the supply i 3
exhausted, eranting tbat it will be resorted to, are we to have
legislation permitting the importation of Asiatic labor into
one part of the United States while excluding it from all
other parts? Will the idand planters have the advantage of
cheap Asiatic labor over our sugar-beet farmers?
These are practical questions, and the advocates of annexa
tion must answer them.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1597.
THE IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION BILL.
SENATOR LODGE, who has charge of the immigration
restriction till that was t:> have been brought up in the
Senate this morning, has agreed to postpone it in order
to make way for the bill providing for the next census. The
delay is not expected to be long, but it is to be hoped no fur
ther postponements will bi permitted, and that a more thor
ough system of restricting immigration will be enacted as
speedily as possible.
The evils of unrestrained immigration have long been
felt both in th: East and in the West. The great mass of the
people are strongly in favor of putting a check upon the in
coming of cheap laborers and vicious persons to the country.
They have demanded restriction for y ars past, and all parties
have pledged themselves to provide it. The time has now
come to keep the pledge, and the adm nistration of prosperity
is relied upon to do it.
In his inaugural 2ddiess President McKinley said: "A
grave peril to the country would be a citizenship too ignorant
to understand or too vicious to appreciate the great value and
beneficence of our institutions and laws; ani against all who
come here to make war upon them, our gates must be promptly
and tightly closed."
From that statement it is clear the President Is a strong
supporter of the policy of restriction. There is no danger of
a veto if a proper bill is sent to him, and upon Congress de
volves the responsibility of preparing such a bill and getting it
enacted into law befo:e the rush of immigration with the com
ing spring.
The revival of prosperity in the United States will be
sure to attract cheap laborers from Europe, and unless some
guard is set they will form serious competitors to American
workingmen in nearly all forms of industry, as well as infus
ing a dangerous element into our population. Prompt action
is therefore necessary on the bill, and it is to be hoped that
those who are sincere in their efforts to exclude vicious immi
gration on the eastern side of the continent will have an eqral
regard for the Pacific Coast, and vote also against the admis
sion of Hawaii and its thousands of coolie laborers.
THE DEADLY GAS-METER.
CORONER HAWKINS has rendered an important ser
vice to the public in calling attention to the dangers at
tending the use of gas in this city. His suspicion that
many persons who are supposed to have committed sui. ide by
gas asphyxiation may have been guiltless of self- murder is
seemingly well founded. In the past two years such deaths
have averaged more than one a week and the Coroner is
justified in believing that all of them could not have been due
to deliberate suicide.
Whether his conclusions are well or ill founded it is clear
that the evidence in favor of the suspicions of the Coroner is
so strong as to make it worth while lor the city authorities to
carry out a thorough and rigid examination of the gas supply of
the city and the manner in which it is applied tor use. If there
is nothing wrong with the nature of the gas, nor any careless
ness on the part of the gas company or innkeepers in the way it
is supplied, it will be just as well to let the fact be known,
while it there is anything wrong the remedy cannot be applied
too promptly nor too firmly.
It has not been long since the people of Boston had a
campaign of education on this very subject of dangerous gas.
Deaths by gas asphyxiation had become too common there for
the idea cf suicide to be credited in every case, while the well
known carefulness of many of the victims precluded the
theory that they had ccme to death by reason of their igno
rance or carelessness.
The Boston investigations disclosed the fact that water gas
Is dangerous beyond all conception by the general public. It
is not only much more poisonous than the ordinary coal gas,
but it is comparatively odorless and cannot be so readily de
tected when escaping. It is the general opinion among ex
perts that th; use of such gas for illuminating purposes
should be prohibited by law as something altogether too dan
gerous to life to be permitted in any home or hotel.
There is no occasion for making a sensation of the sub
ject. Nothing can be gained by jumping at the conclusion
that our gas is extra dangerous and denouncing the gas com
panies as poisoners of the people. Such methods do more
harm than good. What is needed is a thorough and impartial
investigation by competent experts. Let us find out what is
wrong and then proceed to 2pp!y the remedy without a day's
delay.
FOSTAL SAVINGS BANKS.
NO recommendation made by the President or member
of his Cabinet 'has attracted more attention or won a
wider favor with the people than that of Postmaster-Gen
eral Gary urging the establishment of postal savings banks.
Tne issue has been long before the public, and in a general
way has been elaborately discussed, so that the recommenda
tions of the Postmaster-General are not in the nature of a nov
elty, but come, as it were, in response to a popular demand, as
well as a public need.
Postal banics have proven beneficial wherever they have
been tried. Nd country where they have been operated has
ever abol'shed them. They are found useful, not only in mat
ters of finance, but as promoters of thrift, inasmuch as they
afford to the people a means of providing for the preservation
of their savings with as much security as that given to those
who are rich enough to invest in Government bonds.
It has been pointed out by the Postmaster-General that
postal banks will yield a benefit to the community by reason
of bringing into tbe channels of finance, and therefore into use
in commerce and industry, large sums of money now hoarded
in localities where there are not sufficient banking facilities.
These general advantages cannot be doubted, but at the same
time the benefits will be likely to accrue more to workingmen
than to auy other class. They will be provided through the
poMal banks with places, even in the smallest villages, lor de
positing their savings with security as ample as that pro
vided in the largest cities.
The importance of the subject is such that a strong effort
should be made to assure the establishment of such banks by
Congress at the present session. For that reason memorials
should be promptly sent to Washington on tho subject. It is
to be hoped the convention of the American Federation of
Labor, now in .-ession at Nashville, will pass resolutions urging
action. Every voice from the people counts at Washington,
and none is more potent than that of organized labor asking
legislation for the general good.
SAN FRANCISCO ILLUSTRATED.
THE Evening Bulletin celebrated the holiday season yester
day by publishing an illustrated industrial edition of
forty pages, devoted mainly to an exposition of the in
dustries, commerce and general condition of San Francisco
The number was a notable one, and by reason of the splendid'
showing it made for the city and its trade will do much to
encourage the holiday spirit of the people and make business
lively.
Ills certainly gratifying to see that so good a report can
be made, not only of existing conditions, but of the prospects
of the city, and this edition of the Bulletin will servo as a good
introduction to the elaborate account to be given of all Cali
fornia in the forthcoming New Era edition of The Call.
Durrant's attorneys say they have some sensational evi
dence in store. They have been saying the same thing for
about two years and a half. Perhaps they lost the key to the
storeroom.

EUGENE FiELD'o ITEMIZED BILL

In the winter of 1889 the Indianapolis
friends of J»,mes Whttcomb Riley dered
him a complimentary tenefit, upon which oc
casion Kill Nye and Eugene .ill offered their
services, ana In conjunction with a number of
lo.al celebrities the occas on proved to be the
great social event of the season. The Grand
Opera-house was crowded to the doors. Nye
occupied the stage and prefaced his lecture by
humorously referring to his iriend Eugene

Bohemian from Chicago la search of a job."
His remark* were greeted with generous ap
plause, and after the usual Interlude Kiel!

HOW THE EXAMINER EXPOSES ITS OWN
LIES CONCERNING THE KLONDIKE FAMINE.
Necessity arises for displaying another lie of yellow journalism. The
extracts from the Examiner printed below tell their own story. They show
that sheet' to be as unreliable in serious matters as in others, and that dearly
as it loves a sensation it prizes a falsehood more. At the time the Examiner
denied the possibility of famine in Dawson THE CALL had published from
its courageous correspondent, Sam Wall, information that famine was
inevitable. Now that Mr. Wall's reports have been verified, the Examiner,
'n large type and wide columns, demonstrates that its former position was
wrong and that of THE CALL right. This is not an uncommon circumstance,
except that usually the 'yellow sheet having lied sticks to it firmly after
having been detected and branded. Here are two items from that peculiar
paper, the first having appeared December i and the second December 13:
[From the Examiner of Dec. 1.1
MINERS ARE SAFE.
Accurate Reports From Dnwso"
Indicate No Danger of
Famine.
The course of the fake-sensation jour
nals in misrepresenting the situation at
Dawson City is to be deplored. The fact
trial they were beaten on the news, that
•they did not get a correspondent into
the Klondike until two months after the
Examiner expedition, with Joaquin
Miller, E. J. Livetmish and William
Krellng, the photographer, had arrived
there, and even the fact that their corre
spondents wire notable to get the news
after they arrived in Dawson, offer no
excuse for the famine reports that they
are spreading across their iront pages.
The reports sent to the Examiner by
Mr. Livemash are the careful and con
servative statements of a trustworthy
man, and the people may depend on
what he says as facts. Mr. Livernash
hail been in Dawson two months when
he wrote, and he understood the situa
tion as well as any one. It was bad
enough, for he found undoubted scarcity,
and a necessity for sending down the
river to Fort Yukon the men who had
come in without supplies. But there is
a big difference between scarcity and
starvation. It is the difference between
life and death. Two steamers had got
through, and these two steamer? carried
some 300 tons of provisions— to
feed 11100 people lor the winter with
comfort. These provisions, with those
already in Dawson, are enough to keep
life in the men who are there. It is true
that the scarcity will be severs on the
destitute, and the fact that they have
gone into the Klondike in the face ot
warnings ol the need of food and money
may^iot make the men who have plenty
very good-humored about supporting
them. But as many of the destitute
have been shipped down the river where
supplies are more plentiful, and as the
charily of the camp is eenuiue though
rough, the people can feel assurance
that the danger of starvation is not
great.
It is a gross wrong that the relatives of
the adventurous men who have gone to
seek fortune in the north should be tor
tured by needless alarms for the sake of
a few nickels. They may b • reassured in
regard to the situation by reading the
information that Mr. Livemash hhS sent
out through the Examiner.
SAID A CITY GERM TO A COUNTRY BACILLUS.
"I'm a little airaid," said the tuberculosis bacillus, "that we shall be discovered."
"What could have induced him," exclaimed the rheumatic tendency in disgust, "to quit
M:ipitas and old Dr. Dingleyl Everything was so peaceful there, and yon and I might have
completed our work undisturbed."
••It was his eyes," said the bacillus thoughtfully. "They've troubled him so much during
the pats few months that he vowed he'd come up to San Francisco to see about glasses, as soon
as he could leave his business. Now he has come, and I suppose it'll be all over with us. 1 shall
be hunted and worried, and you "' ;
"Oh. I— l may as well give up," remarked the rheumatic tendency despairingly. "'Tisa't
a fair fight we have with these city doctors. You may outwit them, but I "
"I fear all those strange Instruments and appliances. Who can tell what they may dis
cover?"
"How in the world can an industrious bacillus, the father of a flourishing family, hope
to nourish his children if these doctors ore permitted everlastingly to poke and peer and pry.
1 confess I'm alarmed. "
"Do you notice," asked the tendency wistfully, "how very prominent the rheumatic symp
toms are to-day? I wish now 1 hadn't been quite so active during the fall, but the season was so
favorable and hi- general condition so promising that I could not resist. You know how the
enthusiasm for work, under proper conditions, grows on one."
"On, yes," sighed the bacillus, "but I'm more to be pitied than you. His frequent colds,
his self-neglect, and, as you say, his overworked condition tempted me to go ahead. I
never believed he'd carry out his threat to come to the city, and now . is he sits so pale and
anxious In the big chair, with the doctor eying him with that air of professional solicitude,
his body, his face, his very voice shout tubercolosis. Even Dr. Dingley would understand
and suspect my plan for the spring campaign could he see him to-day, with the fresh cold he
caught last night."
"I have thought seriously of coming to San Francisco to live— tho changing weather would
be so good for business. But, on the whole, I'll stay with Milpitas which is a good place
whero a steady bacillus, with no bad habits, may make a comfortab'.e living for his family,
provided, of course, this doctor "
"Pardon me," interrupted a typhoid germ that had joined them unperceived, "I wouldn't
venture to adaress you, but that I see you're from the country and "
"Indeed I" exclaimed the two very stiffly.
" and I may De of use to you. I may as well confess that when he entered the inner
office 1 joined you, and have listened to your conversation with much interest. I hope you
will pardon me," concluded the polite germ.
"Not at all, not at all," murmured the bacillus, much embarrassed.
"I must tell you that I hope to become a near neighbor of yours, lam tired of city life.
Sanitation, you know, has become such a fad in the city, and, besides, business is greatly
overdone here. I fancy that there is room in Milpltas for an industrious, competent germ,''
lie added, conceitedly, '"who can show a record of success in every case attempted."
"But." ventured the rheumatic tendency, "1 shou'd have thought you'd not have changed
your residence just now, when you knew the doctor was shortly to examine him."
The germ lauehei heartily.
"Ah, my poor friends," he said, patronizingly, "so that Is the bugbear you have conjured
up to distress yourselves with. That is the very reason I spoke in the first place. This doctor
is a specialist."
"Wei.?" said the bacillus and the tendency together.
"Well," answered the germ. In a bored lone, "you are pretty rural."
"But he can't help seeing " -
"Ah, yes, ne can. Do you suppose any self-resp3Ctlng specialist will notice any disease
but the one he's treating? Tnis doctor is examining the eye— mind you, the eye. To him the
potion*, is simply an eye, mere or less abnormal or diseased. lie sees nothing above, below,
around or about that eye. He may examine the other eye. but that's as far as any really tip
top specialist will go. If the patient were to die in this chair, right under the doctor's nose,
the specialist would go on calmly and very cleverly with his examination of the eye, pro
vided, of course, the patient were not so inconsiderate as to permit the eyelid to fall while he
drew his last breath."
"Tnen you think ," bjgan the bacillus, Joyfully.
"That jounced have no tear whatever," said the germ, graciously.
Cartels falls on the bacillus, the tendency and the germ hand in hand, dancing merrily,
in all good-fellowship, as the patient leaves the inner office and the boy closes the door be
hind him. Miriam M ichelson.
NOTES ABOUT NOTABLES.
The Duchess of York is the only British

Governor Northen of Georgia, in his speech
at the Atlanta Exposition, said that he trusted

said, in speaking ot iglaud and Ireland, that
he "was an enemy of loth Kingdoms who
wished to diminish the brotherly affections of

MAD RUSH
FROM THE
KLONDIKE.
VICTORIA, B. C, Dae. 12.— The
prophecy of old miners that the \i i der
ness road from the Klondike back to
civilization will be marked ihis winter
by dead men's bones is now all too certain
of fulfillment. For, by the steamer
Topeka, arriving this morning from
Dyea, news is received that more than a
thousand ill- provisioned men stampeded
from Dawson during the latter part of
Octobar, and, impelled by the haunt
ing fear of famine, are now madly
forcing their way over the moun
tains.
Auk, the Indian mail-carrier who
brings this report, left the Yukon capital
fully ten days after the lialton party,
lie says that the vanguard of the terror
stricken army is following less than a
week behind him. He passed many men
on the way out, not a few of whom had
only just reached the Klondike, after
enduring innumerable hardships on the
journey inward, and, speiking from long
experience of the country and its
winter condition, Auk declares that
fully 25 per cent of the stamped
ing army will never live to recite
the terrors cf their flight from the
north.
The river steamers Bella and Weare, it
now appears, did not land more than
100 tons of provisions on their arrival
in Dawson, in the early part of October,
owing to their having been held up at
Circle City, and that wnich at first
seemed salvation for tha beleaguered
residents has provel but a mockery of
their misfortune.
The only bright view of the present
situation it that the crossing of the pass
above Dyea and Sitaguay has lately been
greatly facilitated through the rapid
advance of the tramway-builders at tho
former point, and the great progress
made in the work of building the wagon
road from Skaguay, at which 108 men
have been employed, under Superin
tendent Blackett.
Within a month the road will be in
excellent condition for sleds of all
kinds.
Tlie Topeka brought sixty passengers,
but oniy Auk, the Indian, came through
from Dawson City.

OUR NEW POSTAL CARDS.
New York Herald.
The Postoffice Department is soon to issue
an entirely new set of jos'al cards, and inci
dentally, as a result of greater economy in
their manufacture, the Government is to save
at least $50,000 a year.
The cards are to be slightly smaller than
those now in use, and as millions of them are
issued by the department annually a part of
the saving is attributable to this reduction in
size.
Tnere are to te three styles of cards in the
, new issue. Tne ordinary single card for both
I domestic and international use is to bo 3' 4 by
j s}, inches. There is to be a smaller cm. lor
aoinestic use only which is to be 2 15-16 by
4 15-10 inches, and a double return card for
both domestic and international use which is
j to be 5} by OJj' inches. Th.-; smaller card is
! an entire. V new size; the ordinary single card
is to be a quarter oi an inch narrower than
| the corresponding card now in use, and tho
doable reply card is also reduced a quarter of
|an inch in uh.
No cnarge whatever is to be made in the
design ol either the single international card,
the double domestic or the double interna
tional card. New designs Have Leon adopted
for the ordinary domestic card and the new
smaller domestic card.
The ordinary card will have a portrait of
Thomas Jeffer.-on. three-quarter face, looking
j to the left, just as it appears on the present
card, but surrounded by a somewhat fuller
Olive wreath, and having at the bottom, vi
j very small capitals on a curved tablet, the
name "Jeit'ersou." To the left of the portrait
are three straight lines of lettering. The hist
I is made of the words "Postal card— cent."
| in gothic capitals. The second line contains
j tne woids "United Stales or America." in or
j namental capitals npon a plain black tablet
surrounded by a single fine black line, wnbA
I lieari-shaped fiuiai at either end ana asti" t
circular ornament at the bottom, hav.ns°W^
I straight line extension irom each side ru "V
j nlng parallel with the tablet. The iblrdlinVf
is made up of the words, " 1 his side for the ad
! dre-s oniy," in very small gothic capitals.
j The single small card contains a portrait of
John Adams, three-quarter face, in the upper
right hand corner, looking to the left, sur
rounded hy an olive wreatu, and with the
j name "John Adams" upon a scroll at the bot
i torn. To the lelt oi the portrait are three lines
lof ordinary romati capitals. The fl si con
tains the words "Postal card— one ceut." The
second line contains the words "United States i
I oiAmeriCi" in capitals. The third line con- «
| tains in quite small letters the words -'This
I side is for the address only." Between me
j second and third me is an ornamental dasa.
