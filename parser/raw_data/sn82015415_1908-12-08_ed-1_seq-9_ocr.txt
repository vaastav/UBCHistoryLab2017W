FINANCES.
The financial standing of the Nation
at the present time is excellent, and
the financial management of the Na
tion's interests by the tlovernment
during the last seven years has shown
the most satisfactory results. But
our currency system Is imperfect, and
it is earnestly to be hoped that the
Currency Commission will be able to
propose a thoroughly good system
'which will do away with the existing
defects.
During the period from July 1, 1901,
to September 30, 1908, thero was an
increase in tho amount of money in
circulation of $902,991,399. The in
crease in the per capita during this
period was ?7.0G. Within this time
there were several occasions when it
was necessary for the Treasury De
partment to come to the relief of the
money market by purchase or redemp
tions of United States bonds; by in
creasing deposits in national banks;
by stimulating additional issues of na
tional bank notes, and by facilitating
Importations from abroad of gold. Our
imperfect currency system1 has made
these proceedings necessary, and they
were effective until tho monetary dis
turbance in the fall of 1907 immensely
increased the difficulty' of ordinary
methods of relief. By the middle of
November the available working bal
ance in tho Treasury had been reduc
ed to approximately $5,000,000. Clear
ing house associations throughout the
country had been obliged to resort to
the expedient of issuing clearing
house certificates, to be used as mo
ney. In this emergency it was de
termined to invite subscriptions for
$50,000,000 Panama Canal bonds, and
$100,000,000 three per cent certificates
of indebtedness authorized by the act
of June 13, 1898. It was proposed to
re-denosit in the national banks tho
proceeds of these issues, and to per
mit their use as a basis lor auaiuonai
circulating notes of national banks.
The moral effect of this procedure was
so great that it was necessary to Is
sue only $24X31.980 of tho Panama
Canal bonds and $15,430,500 of tho
certificates of lndtedness.
During tho period from July 1, 1901,
to September 30, 1908, tho balance ho
tween tho net ordinary receipts and
the net ordinary expenses of the Gov
ernment showed a surplus In tho four
years 1902, 1903, 190G and 1907, and
a deficit in the years 1904, 1905, 1908
and a fractional part of tho fiscal
vear 1909, The net result was a sur
nlus of $99,283,413.54. Tho financial
operations of tho Government during
this period, baBed upon these differ
ences between receipts nnd expend!- stnto Commerco Commission and ro
turcs. resulted In a net reduction ot moved from tho domain of tho nnl-trust
tho lntorest-boarlng dobt ot tho Unit-
oil Stnto from $987,141,010 to $897,203,-
990. notwithstanding Hint thoro hnd
boon two salon of Panama Canal bonds
amounting In tho nggrogato to ?&i,-
08I.QJ0, nnd nn Iwuie of throe per cioni
efiitlllenloB of lndohtilno iindor tho
8. President Roosevelt's message was
act of June 13, 1898, amounting to
$15,43G,50O. ' Refunding operations of
the Treasury Department, under the
act of March 14, 1900, resulted in the
conversion into two per ce,it c'oiiloIs
of 1903 of $200,309,400 bonds bearing
higher rates of interest. A decrease
of $8,C87,75G In the annual interest
charges resulted from these opera
tions. In short, during the seven years
and three months there has been a net
surplus of nearly one hundred mil
lions of receipts over expenditures, a
reduction of the interest-bearing debt
by ninety millions, in spite of the ex
traordinary expense of the Panama
Canal, and a saving of nearly nine
millions on the annual interest charge
This Is an exceedingly satisfactory
showing, especially In view of the
fact that during this period the Na
tion has never hesitated to undertake
any expenditure that it regarded as
necessary. There have boon no new
taxes and no increases of taxes; on
the contrary some taxes have been
taken off; thero has been a reduction
of taxation.
CORPORATIONS.
As regartls the great corporations
engaged in interstate business, and es
pecially the railroads, I can only re
peat what I have already again and
again said in my messages to the Con
gress. I believe that under the inter
state clause of the Constitution the
United States has complete and par
amount right to control all agencies
of interstate commerce, and I believe
that the National Government alone
an exerciso this right with wisdom
and effectiveness so as both to secure
justice from, and to do justice to, the
great corporations which are the most
Important factors in modern business.
I believe that it is worse than folly
to attempt to prohibit all combina
tions as is done by the Sherman anti
trust law, because such a law can be
enforced only Imperfectly and un
equally, and its enforcement works al-
most as much hardship as good, i
strongly, advocate that Instead of an
unwise effort to prohibit all combina
tions, there shall be substituted a law
which shall expressly permit comblna-(we must stand heartily for the rights
inn wMr.1, nr in tho intrpRt nf thP!"f every decent man, whether he be
public, but shall at the same time give
to some agency of tho National Gov
ernment full power of control and
supervision over them. One4 ot ths
chief features ot this control shou'.i there should be a premium put upon
bo securing entire publicity In all mat individual initiative, individual capa
ters which the public has a right S city, and an ample reward for the
know, and furthermore, the power,
not by judicial but by oxecutivo ac
tion, to prevent or put a stop to ev
ery form of Improper favoritism or
other wrongdoing.
Tho railways of tho country should
bo put completely under tho Intor-
law. Tho power of tho Commission
should bo mndo thoroughgoing, so
that It 'could oxorclso comploto super-
vIhIoii nnd control ovor tho Iwnio of
Rocurltlos n well nn ovor tho railing
nnd lowering of ruin. At regard

summary. rno power to investigate
the financial operations and accounts
of the railways has been one of the
most valuable features in recent legH
latlon. Power to mako combinations
and traffic agreements should do ex
plicitly conferred upon the railroads,
the permission of tho Commission be
ing first gained and the combination
or agreement being published In nil its
details. In the Interest of tho public
the representatives of the public
should havo complete power to ceo
that the railroads do their duty by the
public, and as a matter of coarse this
power should also bo exorcised so as
to sec that no Injustice is done to the
railroads. The shareholders, the em
ployees and the shippers all have In
terests that must be guarded. It is
to the Interest of all of them that no
swindling stock speculation should be
allowed, and that there should bo no
Improper Issuance of securities. The
guiding intelligences necessary for the
successful building and successful
management of railroads should re
ceive ample remuneration; but no man
should be allowed to make money in
connection with railroads out of frau
dulent over-capltalizatlon and kindred
stock-gambling performances; thero
must be no defrauding of investors,
oppression of the fanners and busi
ness men who ship freight, or callous
disregard of the rights and needs of
the employees. In addition to this
the interests of the shareholders, of
tho employees, and of the shippers
should all be guarded as against one
another. To give any one of them
undue and improper consideration is to
(do injustice to the others. Rates must
be made as low as Is compatible with
giving proper returns to all tho em
ployees of the railroad, from the .high
est to the lowest, and proper returns
to the shareholders; but they must
not, for instance, be reduced In such
fashion as to necessitate a cut In the
wages of the employees or the aboil
tlon of the proper and legitimate pro
fits of honest shareholders.
Telegraph and telephone companies
engaged in interstate business should
be put under the jurisdiction of the
Interstate Commerce Commission.
It is very earnestly to be wished
that our people, through their repre
sentatives, should act in this matter.
: It is hard to say whethor most dam
age to tho country at large would
come from entire failure on the part
of tho public to supervise and control
the actions of the great corporations,
or from the exercise of the necessary
governmental power in a way which
would do Injustice and wrong (o the
corporations. Both the preachers of
nn restricted Individualism, and the
preachers of an oppression which
would deny to able men of business
the Just reward of their Initiative and
business sagacity, are advocating po
licies that would be fraught with the
gravest harm to the whole country.
To permit every lawless capitalist, ev
ery law-defying corporation, to take
any action, no matter how iniquitous,
in the effort to secure an improper
profit and to bulk up privilege, would
be ruinous to tho Republic and would
mark the abandonlnent of the effort to
secure in the Industrial world the Bpl
rlt of democratic fair-dealing. On the
other hand, to attack these wrongs in
that spirit of demagogy which can see
wrong only when committed by the
man of wealth, and is dumb and blind
in the presence of wrong committed
against men of property or by men of
no property, Is exactly ns evil as cor-
ruptly to defend the wrongdoing, of
men of wealth. The war we wage must
be waged against misconduct, against
wrongdoing wherever it is found; and
a man ot great wealth or a man-who
earns his livelihood as a wage-worker
or a tiller ot tho soil.
It Is to the Interest of all of us that
great directing intelligences alone
competent to manage the great busi
ness operations ot today. It Is well
to keep in mind that exactly as tho
anarchist is tho worst enemy of lib
erty and tho reactionary tho worst
nnomy of ordor, so tho men who de
fend tho rights ot proporty havo most
jto fear from (ho wrongdoers of great
wealth, nnd tho men who aro clinm

'fear from tho domngoguon who. in tho

cessarily invites a violent reaction
against the cause the) wrongdoer no
minally upholds. In point of danger
to the Nation there is nothing to
choose between on the one hand the
corruptlonlst, tho bribe-giver, the
bribe-taker, tho man who employs his
great talent to swindle his fellow-citizens
on a largo scale, and, on tho oth
er hand, the preacher of class hatred,
the man who, whether from ignor
ance or from willingness to sacrifice
his country to his ambition, persuades
well-meaning but wrong-headed men
to try to destroy tho Instruments up
on which our prosperity mainly rests.
Let each group of men beware of and
guard against the shortcomings ,o
which that group Is Itself most linble.
Too often wo see the business com
munity In a spirit of unhealthy class
consciousness deplore tho effort to
hold to account under the law tho
wealthy men who In their manage
ment of great corporations, whether
railroads, street railways, or other In
dustrial enteprlses, have behaved In
a way that, revolts the conscience of the
plain, decent people. Such an nttltudo
can not be condemned too severely,
for men of property should recognize
that they jeopardize the rights of pro
perty when they fall heartily to join
In the effort to day away with the
abuses of wealth. On the other hand,
those who advocate proper control on
behalf of the public, through the
State, of these great corporations! and
of the wealth engaged on a giant scale
In business operations, must ever keep
iiiftnind that unless they do scrupu
lous justice to the corporation, unless
they permit ample profit, and cordial
ly encourage capable men of business
so long aa thoy act ub .btmeaty. thty
are striking at tne root of our na
tlonal wellbelng; for in the long run,
under tho more pressure of material
distress, the people as a whole would
probably go back to the reign of an
unrestricted individualism rather than
submit to a control by tho State so
drastic and so foolish, conceived In a
spirit of such unreasonable and narrow
hostility ato wealth, as to prevent busi
ness operations from being profitable,
and therefore to bring ruin upon the
entire business community, and ulti
mately upon the entire body of citi
zens. The opposition to Government con
trol of these great corporations makes
Its most effective effort In the shape
of an appeal to the old doctrine of
States' rights. Of course there aro
many sincere men who now believe
in unrestricted individualism In busi
ness, just as there were formerly
many sincero men who believed in
slaverythat Is, in the unrestricted
right of an individual to own another
individual. These men do not by
themselves "have great weight, how
ever. The effective, fight against ade
quate Government control and super
vision of Individual, and especially
of corporate, wealth engaged in inter
state business is chiefly done under
cover; and especially under cover of
an appeal to States' rights. It Is not
at all infrequent to read In the sam
speech a denunciation of predatory
wealth fostered by special privilege
and defiant of both the public welfaro
and law of tho land, and a denuncia
tion of centralization In the Central
Government of the power to deal with
this centralized and organized wealth.
Of course tho polcy set forth In such
twin denunciations amounts to abso
lutely nothing, for the first half Is nul
lified by the second half. Tho chief
reason mnoUg the many sound and
compelling reasons, that led to tho
formation of the National Govern
ment, was the absolute need that the
Union, and not the several States,
should deal with Interstate and for
eign commerco; and tho power to deal
with Interstate commerce was granted
absolutely and plenarily to tho Cen
tral Government and was exercised
completely as regards tho only instru
ments of interstate commerco known
in thoso days the waterways, tho
highroads, as well as tho partnerships
of individuals who then conducted all
ot what buBlnoss thoro was. Inter
state commerco Is now chiefly conduct
ed by railroads; and tho great corpor
ation has supplanted tho mass of small
partnerships or Individuals. The pro
posal to make tho National Govern
niont supromo ovor, nnd thoroforo to
glvo it comploto control ovor, tho rail
roads and nthor Instruments of tutor
gtato commurco is ninroly a proposal
to carry out to tho letter ono of tho
prlmo purposos, If not the prime pur
Hm, for wlilali thn CfliiitJtuUoii wan
founded. It doos not repriwont etui
trallzatlon. It represents merely the
acknowledgment of tho patent fact
that centralization has already come
In business. ' If this Irresponsible out
side business power is to be controlled
in the Interest of the general puDlIc it
can only be controlled In one way;
by giving adequate power of control
to tho one sovereignty capable of ex
ercising such power tho National
Government. Forty or fifty separate
state governments can not exercise
that power over corporations doing
business in most or all of them: first,
because they absolutely lack the au
thority to deal with Interstate busi
ness In any form; and second, because
of tho Inevitable conflict of authority
sure to nrlse in tho effort to enforce
different kinds of state regulation, of
ten inconsistent with one another and
sometimes oppressive in themselves.
Such divided authority can not regu
late commerce with wisdom and ef
fect. Tho Central Government Is the
only power which, without oppres
sion, can nevertheless thoroughly and
adequately control and supervise the
large corporations. To abandon the
effort for National control means to
abandon tho effort for all adequate
control and yet to render likely con
tinual bursts of action by State legis
latures, which can not achieve the
purpose sought for, but which can do
a great deal of damage to the cor
poration without conferring any real
benefit on tho public.
, I believe that tho more farsighted
corporations are themselves coming to
recognize the unwisdom of the vi&
lent hostility they have displayed dur
ing the last few years to regulation
and control by the National Govern-
muIlt of combinations bngaged in In-
terstato business. Tho truth is that
we who believe in this movement of
asserting and exercising a genuine
control, In the public interest, over
these great corporations have to con
tend against two sets of enemies, who,
though nominally opposed to one an
other, aro really allies in preventing
a proper solution of the problem.
Thero aro. first, the big corporation
men. and the extreme individualists
among business men, who genuinely
believe In uttcly unregulated business
that Is. in the reign of plutocracy:
and. second, tho men who. being blind
to tho economic movements of tho
clay, believe in a movement of repres-
sion rather than of regulation oi cor-
porations, and who denounce both the
power ot me ranroaus anu mo vaui-
clse of the Federal power which aUno
can really control the railroads. Those j
who believe In efficient national con-
trol. on tho other hand, do not in tho
least object to combinations; do not
in the least object to concentration in
business administrate. On the con-
trary, they favor both, with the all
important proviso that there shall bo
such publicity about their workings,
and such thoroughgoing control over
them, as to Insure their being in tho
Interest, and not against the interest,
of the general pulJlic. We do not ob
ject to tho concentration of wealth and
administration; but we do believe in
the distribution of tho wealth in pro
fits to the real owners, nnd in securing
to tho public the full benefit of the
concentrated administration. Wo be
lieve that with concentration In ad
ministration there can come both tho
advantage of a large ownership and
of n moro equltablo distribution of
profits, and at tho same time a bet
tor service to tho commonwealth. Wo
believe that the administration should
be for tho benefit ot the many; and
mat greeu anu rascauiy, practiced on
i largo scale, should be punlsned ns
reienuessiy as u pracuccu on a biiiuii
HCalC.
Wo do not for a moment bellevo that
the problem will bo solved by any
short and easy method. The solution
will como only by pressing various
concurrent remedies. Some of these
remedies must lie outsldo the domain
ot all government. Somo must lie
outside tho domain of tho Federal
Government. But thero Is legislation
which tho Federal Government alone
can enact nnd which Is absolutely vi
tal in order to securo tho attainment
of our purpose. Many laws aro nced

We havo begun to improve Pearl
Harbor for a naval baso and to pro
vldo the necessary military fortifica
tions for the protection ot tho tsjands,
but I can not too strongly emphasize
the need of appropriations for those
purposes ot such an amount as will
within the shortest possible time
malic those islands practically im
pregnable. Il Is useless to develop
the industrial, conditions of the isl
ands and establish there bases of sup
ply for our naval and merchant fleets
unless wo Insure, as far as human in
genuity can, their safety from for
eign seizure.
One thing to be remembeicd with
all our fortifications Is that it is al
most useless to make them Impreg
nablo from tho sea if they are left
open to land attack. This is true
even of our own coast, but it Is doubly
true of our Insular possessions. In
Hawaii, for instance, It Is worse than
useless to establish a naval station
unless wo establish ft beliind fortifl-
cations so strong that no landing
force can take thorn savo by regular
and long-continued siiege operations.
LABOR.
There nro many matters affecting
labor and the status ot the wage-
worker to which I should like to draw
your attention, but an exhaustive dis
cussion of tho problem In nil Its as
pects is not now necessary. This ad
ministration Is Hearing its end; aud,
moreover, under our form of govern
ment the solution of the problem de
pends upon the action of the States
as much as upon the action ot the
Nation. Nevertheless, there are cer
tain considerations which I wish to set
before you, because I hope that our
people will more and more keep them
In mind. A blind and Ignorant re
sistance to every effort for the re
form of abuses and for the readjust
ment of society to modern industrial
conditions represents not true con
servatism but an Incitement to tho
wildest radicalism; for wlso radical
ism and wise conservatism go hand
in hand ,ono bent on- progress, the
other bent on seeing that no change
Is made unless in the right direction.
I believe in a steady effort, or per
haps It would bo more accurate to say
In steady efforts In many different di
rections, to bring about a condition
of affairs under which the men who
work with hnnd or brain, tho labor
ers, the superintendents, the men who
produce for the market and tho men
who find a market for the articles
produced, shall own a far greater
sharo than nt present of tho wealth
thoy produce, and bo enabled to In
vost It in the tools nnd instruments by
which nil work is carried on. As
far as possible I hopo to see a frank
recognition of tho advantages con
ferred by machinery, organization, and
division of labor, accompanied by aa
effort to bring about a larger share
In tho ownership by wageworker ot
railway, mill, nnd factory. In farm
ing, this simply moans that wo wish

we do not wish to see tho farms so
