By the Associated Press.
Washington, Dec 3. President
Cleveland in hie annual message to
congreBs commences as follows: "The
assemblage within the nation's legisla
tive halis of those charged with the
duty of making laws for the benefit of
a generous and free people impressively
suggests the acting obligation and the
inexorable responsibility involved in
their task. At the threshhold of such
labor now to be undertaken by tbe con
gress of the United States and the dis
charge of the executive duty enjoined
by the constitution I submit this com
munication containing a brief state
ment of the condition of our national
affairs and recommending such legisla
tion as seemB to me necessary and ex
pedient." Our Foreign Relations.
The president first pays attention to
foreign relations and save, "The history
of our recent dealings with other na
tions and our peaceful relations with
them at this time additionally demon
strates the advantage of our consistent
ly adhering to a firm but just foreign
policy, free from envious or ambitious
national schemes and characterized by
honesty and sincerity.'' He refers to
the Chinese and Japanese governments
saying that the United States would af
ford proper protection to the subjects of
both nations during the war, and says
the misapprehension that our consular
agents would absume the eame author
ity as the withdrawn agents of the bel
ligerent powers was promptly cor
rected. The president says he felt constrained
to offer the good offices of this governj
ment in settling the differences with re
gard to Korea, but the precipitation of
actual hostilities defeated this kindly
purpose. Deploring the destructive
war between the two most powerful
eastern nations, said he "I would not
heeitate to heed the intimation that
our friendly efforts for honorably term
inating the hostilities would be accept
able to both belligerents."
He refers to German prohibition
against the importation of American
cattle and fresh meats and to the Ger
man contention that the new cuBtoms
law placing a duty on imported sugars
is a violation of the treaty. In the in
terests of the commerce of both nations
he recommends the repeal of so much
of the statute as imposes a duty on
sugars.
With reference to Hawaii he says:
"Since communicating a voluminous
correspondence in regard to Hawaii and
the action taken by the senate and the N
house of representatives on certain
questions submitted to the judgment
and wider discretion of congress, the
organization of a government in place
of the provisional arrangement which
followed the deposition of the
queen has been announced, with evi
dence of its effective operation. The
recognition usual in such casea has been
accorded the new government."
'The president reviews the unhappy'
state of affairs in Samoa and says;
"i invite expressions of judgment of
congress on the propriety of Bteps being
taken by the government looking to the
withdrawal ' from , engagements with
other powers." ;
The president reviews the reports of
cabinet officers.
Referring to the operations of the
army during the late strike he compli
ments the army on the efficiency and
discipline displayed. He recommends
that the grade of lieutenant general be
revived for the benefit of Major Gen
eral Schofield who would tbua be able
to retire with a rank befitting his merits.
The appointment of additional circnit
judgeB for each district is commended
to the attention of congress.
The Pacific Railroads.
He urges legislation to secure the re
organization of the Union Pacific rail
road on a basis as regards all private
interests and aa favorable to the govern
ment as existing conditions will permit.
Speaking of the navy he says: "If
we are to have a navy for warlike oper
ations, offensive and defensive, we
certainly ought to increase the number
of battle ships and torpedo boats."
He concurs in the opinion of the
secretary of the interior that the com
missioner of the general land office
should be relieved from the duty of de
ciding litigated land ca?ps and that
non-partisan couit should be appointed.
to pass on such cases and that the de
cisions of thiB court should be final.
The Indian questicn is reviewed at
length and the president is of the
opinion that the allotments of land to
Indians should be made very carefully.
About Pensions.
He gives some pension statistics and
says: "The commissioner of pensions
is of the opinion that the year 1S95 be
ing the thirtieth after the close of the
war of the rebellion must according to
all sensible human calculation see the
highest limit of the pension roll and
after that year it must begin to decline.
Barefaced and extensive pension frauds
exposed under the action of the cour
ageous and veteran soldier now at the
head of the pension bureau leave no
room for the claim lhat no purgation of
our pension rolls was needed or that
continued vigilance and prompt action
are not nece?sary to the sameend. The
accusation that an effort to detect pen
sion fraud is an evidence of unfriendli
ness to our worthy veterans and a de
nial of their claims to the generosity of
the government EuggestBannnfortdnate
indifference to the commission of an
offense which has for its motive the pro
curing of pensions and indicates a will
ingness to be blind to the existence of
mean and treacherous crimes which
play upon the demasrog'c fears and
make a sport of the patriotic impulses
of a grateful people."
The report of the secretary of agricul
ture is commended to the careful con
sideration of congress. The advantages
of the civil servicers commented noon
and he says the people are growing
unanimous in regarding party organiza
tion as something that should be used
in establishing party principles instead
of determining partisan activity.
The report of the commissioner ap
pointed to investigate the railroad
strike is complimented."
More Tariff Agitation.
The tariff act passed at the last ses
sion of congress needs - important
amendments. Says the message : "I
am still ia favor of putting coal and
iron on the free list. So far as the
sugar schedule is considered I should
be glad to see every part of the duty on
refined sugar stricken out of the tariff
law. If with all the favors now ac
corded the Bugar refining interests it
still languishes to the extent of closing
tbe refineries and discharging thou
sands of workmen, it would seem to
present a hopeless cass for reasonable
legislative aid." In order to stimulate
commerce the president recommends
the prompt repeal of the law denying
American registry to ships built abroad
and owned by Americans.
Bond Issues.
The president refers to the new issue
of bonds and says: "Nothing could be
worse or farther removed from a sensi
ble financial policy than the relations
existing between the currency the gov
ernment has issued and iB held for re
demption and the means which must
