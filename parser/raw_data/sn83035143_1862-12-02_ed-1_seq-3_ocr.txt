Thb Robbket on Vihetaed Street.
Eliia Hamilton, who stole the $84,00 on
Thursday night from a gentleman, was yes
terday brought before Justice Benham and
sent back to jail in default of $300 bail.
Detective McKinstry made another searob of
Eliia's house on Saturday last, and found
$21,00 more of the money. This makes the
whole amount that was lost, all of whioh was
found by the above indefatigable officer
Latino Up. Vessel owners are admon
ished that plowing the raging main (mainiug
the Lakes) at this season of the year is risky
business, particularly as Insurance Compa
nies take no more risks. The following Tea

port, Tit: Bark Parana, schooners C. C.
Griswold, George Worthington, Return, and

Abbott' ErsroKT or tbx Rebellion.
We are requested to state that the first rol
nme of the eagerly looked for History of the
Rebellion, by Rot. John S. C. Abbott, will
be issued about the 1st of January. Mr. B.
T. Green, the agent of the publishers, is pro
gressing rapidly in the work of canvassing
the country. He has gone through with most
01 the Tillages and will next go tnrouga the
townships. No one who has read Abbott's
histories of other wars and countries will be
willing to forego the pleasure of possessing
this one.
Theater. There was a fair house last
evening to witners the first production of the
fascinating play entitled "Lit'le Fadette, or
the Cricket." It Is one of the most attract
ive plays that we have seen in a long time,
and is well worthy of a crowded honse. Miss
Thompson as " Fanchon," has a scope for
the display .of her artistic powers such as she
has not enjoyed in any previous play in which
she has appeared, and well does she sustain
the character. We have not space to notice
the play at length this morning. Mrs.
Bradshaw as " Old Fadette " was sufficiently
witch-like for Mag Merriiles, almost, Mo
Collom was an excellent " Landry Barbeand."
The play is to be repeated this evening.
There should be a crowded house.
Tsatchee, Gaedxer, Burt & Co. The
firm of Clark, Gardner A Co., having been
dissolved by mutual consent, Mr. Gardner
has united with Thatcher, Burt i Co. in
forming a new firm to be known nnder the
style of Thatcher, Gardner, Burt k Co. The
old firm of Thatcher, Burt k Co. consisted
of Messrs. P. Thatcher, jr., G. H. Burt and
A. C. McNairy. The new firm eonsists of
the above well known gentlemen, together
with Messrs. G. W. Gardner and H. M.
Clafien. All the gentlemen named are bus
iness men who have been long and familiar
ly known, not only at home but abroad. The
junior member of the firm, Mr. Ciaflen, is a
young lean who has proved his integrity, in
lustry and thorough business qualifications
luring several years service with Thatcher,
Bnrt k Co., and we record his promotion
vith pleasure.
The copartnership is formed for the trans
ition of a general produce, storage and com
aissioB business. The new Union Railway,
Ship 'and Canal Elcva'or, which they are
mildlng on Merwin street,(a full description

Xo Beajich Aid Societies. Our attn
toon has been called to a circular issued by
the Ohio Rxlttf Association, 537 H street,
Washington, D. C, which contains an urgent
appeal for hospital stores for Ohio soldiers at
(he East, and which throws most ungenerous
aspersions npon the system of distribution
adopted by other organisations.
As this document has been industriously
ireulated among our Branch Societies, we
are compelled to caution them against the
statements it contains, and to denounce in the
Strongest terms this attempt to undermine the
relationship which we hare been at infinite
pains to build up with our Branchea, and
which has its foundation in the broadest prin
ciples of union in good works.
The officers of the Ohio Relief Association
are Known to us. We hare visited their
rooms, and, although disapproving their nar
row policy, hare furnished them with hospi
tal supplies when they made demands upon
OS.
The wants of our soldiers in Washington
hospitals hare called out our deepest sym
pathies, and when the depots of hospital
supplies at the east have been temporarily
drained, we have gladly contributed from
our stock, which we hold ready for ship
ment for any point, east or west, when most
needed, although for obvious reasons, our
store are mostly sent to western hospitals.
W therefore beg onr Branch Societies to lim
it their charities by no State lines, but to
trust ns to distribute, as heretofore, through
National Commission, the bounties whioh
it is our aim to apply in the most judicious
and prudent manner for the relief of all the
defenders of oar Union.

St. Asdrew0 Fistttai. The Seven
teenth Anniversary Supper and Festival o;
the St Andrew's Society was held at th
American House, last evening, and was very
largely attended. Ireland's band was on
hand, and the Atheueua hall being thrown
open in th early part of the evening, th
company enjoyed a social dance before sup
per was served, as well as after. The eonr
pany set down to a splendid supper, served
in the hotel dining room, at about half-
past 18 o'clock.' The repast reflected
much credit npon the proprietorof the Amer
ioaa House, Mr. Brock way. The dining hall
was decorated and embellished in an appro
priate manner. Wm. Lowrie, E;q., Presi
dent of the St. Andrew's Society, presided at
the supper. After supper, toasts and speech
es followed, which w regret our inability to
make a report of this morning, owing to want
of space. The entire affair passed off in the
most successful and satisfactory manner, re
flecting credit opoa all concerned, and leer
ing a pleasant impression upon the minds of
those participating. Dancing and merriment
were kept np until a late hour.

A Card to Firekek. The undersigned
takes this method of thanking the officers
and members of the Fire Department, for
their prompt and efficient efforts in ex
tinguishing the fire en Sunday morning, on
Merwin street
He also takes this (his earliest) opportunity
to deny that either of the Assistant Engineers,
or any other person wearing the belt or badge
of an Engineer or Assistant Engineer at the
re was drunk or the least intoxicated,
Bona of the Herald to the contrary not
withstanding.
After the work was done, there prebably
was about the usual amount of drinking
amour the bovs some of whom were, and
some were not Firemen. There was noise,
and whoever saw a large fire, in or out of
Cleveland, where thFireman made no noise ?
ut this immaculate Bone says it was Sun-
ay and "church time." To save the
phelinks of this Bone it is to be hoped
that no more fires will oecur on Sunday; but
if there should, then that this same " Bone "
shall call out his hirelings, if any be may
then have, and give the old Firemen of our
lty, the real " mngush method of ex-
ngutshing the. name and sanog property
ith bis " large, rapid, and never nagging
streams."
Until which time the . undersigned will re
main quite satisfied with the result on Sun-
ay morning, considering the advanced state
of the fire when firnt discovered.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 1.
House. Mr. Vallandigham, of Ohio, offer
ed the following resolution which was
adopted :
Kaolved, That the committee on Judicia
ry be instructed to inquire and report to
the fioow) at an early day, by what author
ity of the constitution or laws, if any, the
Postmaster General undertakes to decide
what newspapers may and what newspa
pers may not be transmitted through the
mails.
Mr. Cox, of Ohio, offered the following:
Whereas, Many eitiiens of the United
States hare been seised by persons acting
or pretending to be acting under the au-
ority of the u nitea states, and bare been
carried out of the jurisdiction of the
states of their residence and imprisoned in
the military prisons and camps of the
United States, without any publio charges
being preferred against them, and with
out any opportunity being allowed them
to learn or discorer the charges made
or alleged to be made against them;
and, Whereas, such arrests hare been
made in the States where there is no in
surrection or rebellion or pretense thereof,
or any other obstruction to the authority
of the Gorernment, and, Whereas, it is
the sacred right of erery citizen of the
United States that he shall not be deprWed
of his liberty without due process of law,
and when arrested shall hare a speedy
and publio trial by an impartial jury,
therefore,
Retolvtd, That the House of Representa-
tires does hereby condemn all such arrests
and practices as unwarranted by the Con-
titution and laws of the United States, as a
usurpation of power nerer giren up by
the people to their rulers, and do hereby
demand that all such arrests shall hereaf
ter cease, and that all persons so arrested
and held shall have a prompt and publio
trial according to the prorisions of the
Congress, and laws of the United States.
Un motion of Mr. Colfax, the preamble
and resolution was laid on the table, 80
against 40.
Mr. Kictaardson, or Illinois, offered the
following resolution :
Kaolved, That the President be requested
to inform the House of Representatives
what citizens of Illinois are now confined
in any forts or places of confinement, and
upon what charges such citizens were ar
rested; and that the President also inform
the House of Representatives the names of
the persons arrested in the State of Illi
nois and confined in prisons outside the
limits of said State, what the charges are
against them, by whom charges are made
and by whose order all such arrests are
made.
Mr. Lorejoy moved to lay the resolution
on the table. Adopted, ayes 74, nays 40.
lhe House look a recess to await tne
message of President Lincoln.
After the reading of the President s mes
sage Mr. Morrill moved it and accompa
nying documents to be referred to the com
mittee of the whole and printed.
Mr. V allandieham desired to say a few
words but was prevented by the previous
question.
Motion agreed to and adjourned.
After the reading of the Message, the
Senate adjourned.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The President says, The correspondence
touching foreign affairs, which has taken
place during the last year, is herewith sub
mitted, in compliance with the request to
that effect. If the condition of our rela
tions with foreign nations is less gratify
ing than formerly, it is certainly more sat
isfactory than a nation so unhappily dis
turbed might reasonably have apprehend
ed. A blockade of 3,000 miles of sea-coast
could not be established and rigorously en
forced in a season of great commercial ac
tivity like the present, without committing
occasional mistakes and inflicting unin
tentional injuries upon foreign nations
and subjects. In clear cases of these kinds,
I have, so far as possible, heard and re
dressed complaints by friendly powers.
There is, however, a large and aug
menting number of doubtful cases upon
which the bovernment is unable to agree
with the Governments whose protection is
demanded by the claimants. There are,
moreover, many rases in which the United
States or their citizens suffer wrongs from
the naval or military authorities of for
eign nations, whieh the Governments of
those states are not at once prepared to
redress. I have proposed to some of the
foreign States interested, mutual conven
tions to examine and adjust scon com
plaints. This ha been made e-pecially to
Great Britain, France, Spain, and Russia.
In each case it has been kindly received,
but not yet formally adopted.
Applications have been made to me ny
many free Americans of African descent
ta favor their emiirration with a view to
meh colonisation as was contemplated in
r eesi acts of Congress. Other parties, at
L s&4 sbroad, some from interested
and o 'hr tins, have suggested similar
. ,l . while ob the other hand several
of the 8oanJsl1 Amerin Republics have
,.i" . Out the seadiae of such col
onies to their raf-U" tW-
Under these c.nmstances, I hve de
clined to move anj "cl to anT,
State without first oM&inhig the consent
of its Government, with n aggrementon
its part to receive and protect sue"
grants in all their rights as freemen, nd 1
have at the same time offered to the sever
al States, situated in the tropics or having
colonies there, to negotiate with them on
the subject, with the advice and consent oi
the Senate, to favor the voluntary emigra
tion of persons of that class to their respec
tive territories upon conditions which
shall be equal, just and humane.
Liboria and Hayti are, as yet, the only
ennntriea to which colonists of African de
scent from here could go with certainty of
Wing received and adopted as citizens;
aad I regret to say mat sucn persona con
templating colonization do not seem as
willing to emigrate to inese couuinea
to aome otners, nor as wining as i mma
their taterest demands. I believe, howev
,. tie amnion is improving, and that
er'e long there will be an augmented and
considerable emigration to do in in
ttrantries.'
Our relations with European States re
nin undisturbed, and with States of our
orritinent have improved, especially Mexi
co, Costa Bica, &c : . "

mv- t xnenditures. incident to the
military and mavtvl operations required for
m J . rhj.llien have hith-
erto'been met with a promptitude and cer
tainty unusual in similar cirexmiUnoes,
and the public credit has been fully main
tained. The continuance of the war, how
ever, and the increased disbursements
made necessary, demand your best reflec
tions as to the best modes of providing the
necessary revenue. The suspension of
specie payment by the banks made large
issues of United States notes unavoidable.
In no oihe way cou'.d the payment of the
troops and the satisfaction of other just
demands be so economically or as well
provided for. '
It is extremely doubtful whether a cir
culation of United States notes, payable in
coin and sufficiently large for the wants of
the people, can be permanently useful and
safely maintained. Is there any other
mode in which the necessary provision for
the public wants can be made, and the
great advantages of a safe and uniform
currency secured ? I know of none which
promises so certain results, and at the
same time so unobjectionable, as the or
ganization of banking associations under
a general act of Congress, well guarded in
its provisions.
To such associations the Government
might furnish circulating notes on the se
curity of United States bonds, deposited in
the treasury. These notes, prepared under
the supervision of proper officers, being
uniform in appearance and security, and
convertible always into coin, would at
once protect labor against the evils of a
vicious currency, and facilitate commerce
by cheap and safe exchange. A moderate
reservation from the interest on the bonds
would compensate the United States for the
preparation and distribution of the notes,
and a general supervision of the system,
and would lighten the burden of that por
tion of the public debt employed as secu
rity. The publio crebit, moreover, would be
greatly improved, and the negotiation of
new loans greatly facilitatad by the steady
market demand for Government bonds
which the adoption of the proposed system
would oreate. It is an additional recom
mendation of the measure of considerable
weight in my judgment, that it would re
concile, as far as possible, all existing in
terests by the opportunity offered to ex
isting institutions to reorganize, under the
act, substituting only the uniform nation
al circulation for the local and various cir
lations now issued.
The President then gives a summary
from the Secretary of the Treasury's re
port. Refers to the reports of the Secre
taries of the Navy and War; says though
long, they are only brief abstracts. He
says there is a decided improvement in the
financial condition of the Postoffice Depart
ment compared with previous years. The
Secretary of the Interior reports that the
public lands have ceased to be a source of
revenue. Speaking of Indian affairs and
the recent troubles, he says : " I submit
for your special consideration whether our
Indian system shall not be remodeled. He)
suggests the earliest completion of the Pa
cific Railroad ; also favorable action by
Congress on prospects for enlarging the
greatcanals of New York and Illinois and
Michigan.
The President refers to his compensated
emancipation proclamation of September
22d, and says that portion of the earth occu
pied by the people of the United States is
well adapted to be the home of one national
family, but not for two or more. In the
inaugural address I briefly pointed out the
total inadequacy of disunion as a remedy
for differences between the people of the
two sections. I did so in language which
I cannot improve.
Physically speaking we cannot separate;
we cannot remove our respective sections
from each other; we cannot build an im
passable wall between them. He then re
marks at length on the difficulty of making
any national boundary line. The Presi
dent then suggests amendments to the con
stitution by Congress concurring, to be pro
posed to the legislatures or conventions of
the several States, which, if ratified by
three-fourths of said legislatures, to be
valid as parts of said constitution.
The first article proposes all States abol
ishing slavery before January 1st, iaoo,
Bhall receive compensation from the United
States. The second, all slaves freed by
chances of war, any time before the end
of the rebellion, shall be forever free, but
all owners who had not been disloyal, shall
be compensated. Third, Congress may ap
propriate money, and otherwise provide
for colonizing free colored persons with
their consent, at any place without the
United States.
The President disous3es these articles
at some length and asks, if, then, for a
common object, slave property is to be sac
rificed, is it not just that it be done at a
common charge, and if with less money, or
money easily paid, we can preserve the
benefits of the Union by this means than
we can by tho war alone, is it not econom
ical to do it? The proposed emancipa
tion would shorten this war, perpetuate
peace, insure increase in population and
proportionately the wealth of the country.
Tho President then says, The plan, con
sisting of these articles, is recommended,
not but that a restoration of the national
authority would be accepted without its
adoption, nor will the war or proceedings
under the proclamation of September 22d
be stayed because of the recommendation
of the plan. Its timely adoption, I doubt
not, would bring restoration, and thereby
stay both. And notwithstanding this plan,
the recommendation that Congress provide
by law for compensating any State whioh
may adopt the emancipation before this
plan shall have been acted upon, is hereby
earnestly renewed.
This plan is recommended as a measure,
not in conclusion of, but additional to all
others for restoring and preserving the
National authority throughout the Union.
The subject is presented exclusively in its
economical aspect. The plan is propoled
as a permanent constitutional law.
In conolusion the President says the
dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to
the stormy present. The occasion is piled
high with difficulty, and we must rise with
the occasion. The firey trial through which
we pass will light us down in honoror dis
honor to the latest generations.
We say that we are for the Union. The
world will not forget that while we say
this, we do know how to save the Union.
In giving freedom to the slaves, we ensure
freedom to the free and honorable alike in
what we give and what we preserve. We
shall nobly save, or meanly lose the last
best hope of the earth. Other means may
succeed ; this could not fail. The way is
plain, peaceful, generous and just. A
way which, if followed, the world will for
ever applaud and good must forever bless.

PLANTATICN BITTERS.
Extract from a Letter on the Battle-Field.
This battle (Antietam) has been the most
inguinary of the war, and the only one
fought with visible design and open military
principles. The arrangement of our corps
the overlooking position of the commanding
General the sending into action the right
and left divisions the closing np of the cen
ter, and final success excites bewildering
admiration, and carries the mind to the great
fields of Austerlitz and Wagram, fongbt by
Napoleon. Of all this have I spoken. The
heart history of such a conflict, purchased by
the life of twenty thousand men, must be
found in the hospitals. War has its glo
ries but it has ten thousand demons in
these human tortures, that make the eye
balls ache the heart bleed the lips palsy,
and the brain reel. The sight is at first pos
itively unendurable. The life blood of some
is still trickling away in silent calmness
while the dissevered limbs and maniae brain
of others give rise to sounds Sod grant I may
not again witness.
But ye mothers who here seek a son or
wires a husband or listers a brother or
sons a father know and he consoled that
eron here the hand of mercy is watchful, and
better eare is bestowed upon your loved ones
than might at first seem possible. It was In
the hospital, where rested the gallant Hooker,
that I learned the history of those mythical
words so often seen and so little understood,
" 3. T. 1800 X." . Anything alleviating
the sufferings and saving the lives of oar
soldiers, is a national blessing. I witnessed
some astonishing results from this article.
It is well known the effect of burnt gun
powder and excitement is thirst, which ad
ded to the loss of blood In the wounded, cre
ates the necessity of a reviving stimulant.
In this particular hospipal, the physicians
were allowing their patients to drink Pla ta
tion Bitters, otherwise called 3. T. 18(10 X,
andalthoogh the most numerous here this
division having opened the fight at five in the
morning the men were mostly eomposed
and there was very little fainting. The arti
cle acts upon the nerves in the most incom
prehensible manner, superior to brandy, and
without subsequent reaction. It originated
in the West Indies, eomposed of the cele
brated Calisaya Bark, Roots, Herbs, ic; all
preserved in St. Croix Rum the S. T. 1860
X, being a secret ingredient not yet
revealed to the pnblio. It Is principally rec
ommended for want of appetite, disordered
liver, intermittent fevers, stomachie difficul
ties, Ac. I understand it was somewhat
known in the Southern States previous to the
war, and it appears an agent of Jefferson Da
vis recently applied to the proprietors for the
privilege to make it for hospital purposes da
ring the war, to which they made the following
reply :
New Yoax, Jan. 18th, 1862.
Mr. ,
Agent of , c. .
Dear Sir In reply to your communication
offering as " Fifty thousand dollars for the
recipe and right to make the Plantation Bit
ters for your hospital purposes during the
war," we beg to say, your price is a liberal
one, considering it would cost us nothing to
eomply, and that otherwise we ean derive no
revenue from the Southern States ; but sir,
our duties to our Government and our ideas
of consistency would not allow us to entertain
it, although it may please us to assuage the
sufferings of your misguided followers.
We remain,
Very respectfully yours,
P. H. Dbaki k Co.
These gentlemen give the history of eertal
ingredients of their article for over two hun
dred years showing that through all changes
of the medical profession and its practition
ers, strength, composure and cheerfulness
have been derived from these sources. Dr.
Woods in the Washington Hospitals informed
me that one patient was fast sinking and
orasy, and had not slept an honr for two
weeks, until the Plantation. Bitters came to
his knowledge, when one day's trial gave
him a night's reat, and he was fast recover
ing. I am surprised onr Government has
not equalled Jefferson Davis in energy, and
adopted this invaluable article in all our
hospitals. The weak soldiers cling to it like
a brother. As a lay member, I can bear
witness It is " good to take," and affords
more energy and life than anything I ever
tried. Success to the Plantation Bitters.
But I have digressed. In my next I shall
speak of gathering in the wounded, burying
the dead, Ac. Niconnus.
