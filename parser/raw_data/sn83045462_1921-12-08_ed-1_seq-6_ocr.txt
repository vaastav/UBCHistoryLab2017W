Secretary Davis' School Plan.
Secretary Davis' plan for high
. school reorganization in the District,
' Just submitted to Senator Capper for
V consideration by the joint committee
\ of Congress, will not immediately
elicit approval by those who have
been most closely studying the local
school needs and seek early correction
J of the conditions from which the sys
tem is suffering. It is, however, an
Interesting contribution to the thought
' bearing upoo school betterment and
will call for earnest consideration.
? Broadly, Secretary Davis' plan is
for a city college, rather than a high
~ school system. It may be that such
an institution is desirable. It has
been projected in the past, though not
In such a comprehensive manner. In
deed, more than thirty-live years ago
the late Edward A. Paul, principal of
the high school?there was then but
* one for each race?drafted a proposal
? for a city college, to be evolved out
of the high school system, not replac
ing that system, as Secretary Davis
suggests now, but supplementing It.
The high schools have always been
regarded as the culminating points of
the grade system, as preparatory
schools for college and normal school
? work. Manual training, introduced over
f thirty-seven years ago as an experi
* ment, has become an important fea
ture, calling for not merely a special
school, but for technical equipment in
t other schools. Business training has
? called also for a special school. Thus
the tendency has been to specialize,
and at the same time the high schools,
divided for geographical convenience
also, have grown enormously in size.
Every one of the seven, despite the
provision of new and larger buildings
for them in recent years, is over
crowded today.
The question arises, in connection
with Secretary Davis' proposal,
whether concentration is as much to j
be desired as separation. Doubt has
been bred in many minds recently re
garding the efficiency of the large
school as against the smaller. One of1
the high schools, built for about 2,200
? pupils with every regular seat occu
pied, now has more than 3,000 pupils.
Individuals are submerged in such a
great mans. Contact between pupil
and teacher is reduced to the slight
est degree. The school becomes a
huge machine and, save in the cases
of the few exceptional students, schol
arship suffers In consequence.
What "Washington's system needs
today chiefly is a large addition im
mediately to its grade-school plant,
with additional high-school accommo
dations. All seven of the high schools
are suffering from congestion. ..even
the greatest of them. It will be nec
essary for the Joint committee to con
sider whether to recommend enlarge
ments along all lines, or for the
present along special ones. No doubt
W.e uedl result for the District would
be to proceed with a comprehensive
building plan designed to catch up
with the school arrears in, say, Ave
years. If in the wisdom of the school
authorities and of Congress the con
centrated high school system Just
proposed is adopted, it should be as a
further development, along the lines
of a collegiate institution rather than
a part of the basic school system of
the capital.
China has been regarded as one of
the most peaceful of nations, when
as a matter of fact it has had so much
strife within its own borders that it
could not undertake the kind of light
ing that attracts the most attention.
If all its fighting talents could be co
ordinated. China might take rank as a
great military nation.
i predictions that war would become
obsolete have often been made, but
never realized. Only modes of war
Care considered in their day the ulti
mate possibility have done so.
Conflict is always followed by treaty
making. Time would be saved by
omitting the fight and proceeding di
rectly to the discussion.
Retirement Annuities.
Secretary Mellon suggests in his
annual report that the annuities of
the government civil employes who
have been retired from the service
should be increased. He also sug
gests that the retirement age should
be reduced from seventy to sixty
eight. But the latter is made con
tingent upon the former. That is to
say, Mr. Mellon would not have any
government clerk retired at a lower
age than at present unless he can be
assured of a larger income. Nor. in
deed, should any employe be forced to
qait the service at the rate of retire
' ment pay now prevailing.
In this connection should be con
sidered the case of the clerks who
feave served the government for thirty
years and more and have not reached
> the-retirement age. It has been said
i by thost who have studied the matter
closely that rarely does efficiency con
tinue high after thirty years of con
tinuous work in any one line. Task
weariness sets in and impairs the use
" fulness of the worker. This is true
? lit the government service as else
where. Would it not be better for the
government to permit those who have
labored continuously for thirty years
' to retire, without waiting for attain
ment of the age of seventy?
* BJlt lrteftfer the thirty-year retire
ment principle is adopted, or some
A provision Is made for disability re
tirwaent at less than the present limit
j r
of retirement age, tbe whole matter
jot the system an It has been set la
operation should be studied by Con
gress, through the executive officials
who are charged with the administra
tion of the law. It is expected that'
the report of the actuaries who have
had to do with the keeping of the
retirement accounts will, as Secretary
Mellon's report indicates, warrant a
greater degree of liberality. The
principle should be established to
grant the maximum of benefit to the
retired employes as long as the con
tributions to the fund taken from the
pay of the employes remain at the
present rate.
It may be that eventually the con
tribution rate can be reduced and the
compensation rate increased as well.
This would be the fullest measure Of |
justice to the employes of the govern
ment, who are now taxed to maintain
the retirement fund with no positive
assurance of benefit, though with a
guarantee of a refund of contributions
in case of withdrawal from the service
before the retirement age is reached.
Mr. Harrison Opens the Ball.
Senator Harrison, in bantering tone
and terms, protests the President's ef
fort to solidify his party in Congress.
And yet was not the President
within his rights? Was it not his
duty, indeed, to speak out? Is he not
the leader of his party. In Congress
and out?
These questions answer themselves.
The President is the leader of his
party. His party is divided, and a
party divided against itself cannot
stand. So there was good reason for
him to speak.
And he spoke in good time. The
session opens with a large amount of
business awaiting attention. The re
publican party has a mandate to
attend to it, and tho President wants
it attended to as satisfactorily as pos
sible.
He In probably thinking of two
things?the public's interests and the
Iiarty's interests. If the public's in
terests are well served, the party's will
be also. "He serves his party best
who serves his country best."
The senator from Mississippi would,
of course, be glad to see the opposi
tion remain divided. He wants a dem
ocratic victory next year, and will be
prominent in the contest. It would
fall in excellently with his wishes and
purposes for the republicans to con
tinue their bickerings and hand over
the next Congress?at least the next
House?on a silver salver to the dem
ocrats, as they did in 1910.
Does not Mr. Harrison really com
pliment the President's message when,
j in replying to it and its many sug
i creations, he offers nothing more sub
stantial than criticism of the Presi
dent's desire for party unity?
The House Minority.
Mr. Kitchin of North Carolina, the
leader of the House minority, con
j tinues under the weather. No time
J is set for his probable return to duty.
He is a very competent man for his
post, and probably chafes under his
disability. The House card must ap
peal to him. The subjects are in line
with his past activities as a legislator.
Particularly must he regard his ab
sence from the tussle over tariff re
vision. He has specialized on the
tariff, and if on deck would head the
minority House members of the con
ference committee which will take the
Fordney bill in hand after the Senate
finishes its work of revision.
But in Mr. Garrett of Tennessee
the democrats have an excellent sub
stitute. He is a democrat after Mr.
Kitchin's heart. That is to say, he is
regular after the old order of things.
He and Mr. Kitchin are in full agree
ment on the tariff question, and as a
member of the conference committee
he will probably take the course Mr.
Kitchin in his place would take.
And Mr. Garrett has an opportunity
at this session which may capitalize
well for him if he continues through _
the session as the leader on his side
of the chamber and the democrats win
the next House. In that event he will
probably be in the running for Speak
er, with his services fresh in the
minds of all. He has been In Con
gress since and Including the Fifty
ninth, and therefore holds a place
among his party's veterans on Capi
tol Hill. His district is so safely dem
ocratic it withstood even the repub
lican onslaught of last year.
The inability to make sufficiently
rapid arrangements for a loan from
this country is naively mentioned as
the cause of the overthrow of Guate
mala's government. The conditions
which led to the need of this kind of
pecuniary relief are likely to be in
reality most responsible ? for the dis
satisfaction.
An increase of annuities to retired
government clerks, as suggested by
Secretary Mellon, would be a stimulus
to morale and competence. Uncle Sam
does not need as many workers as he
used to, but he needs the very best
available.
Canada and the United States con
tinue to offer an example that should
be valuable in Europe, of how to be
friendly, though neighbors.
The holiday trade again demon
strates that the Santa Claus myth is
a most influential business reality.
The Shoaling Potomac.
Gen. Beach, chief of engineers, re
ports to Congress that the Virginia
channel of the Potomac river has
shoaled two feet In two years, and he
urged additional dredging to reclaim
the channel for service.
This statement of the rate of river
shoaling will be of Interest to those
who do not personally recall the early
condition of the river at this point,
before the reclamation of the "flats"
was undertaken. The present Poto
mac Park is composed of sediment
dredged from the river bottom and
forced through tubes behind retaining
walls. Millions of cubic yards of ma
terial were thus pumped out of the
channels. Practically every foot of
the park came out of the river bed.
At the sedimentation rate of a foot
a year It is easy to see how the Po
tomac is capable of yielding enough
material to make such a great ex
panse of park. In the early years the
dredging, was only done when actual
necessity compelled. The dredges were
of the old buoket ty?e, lifting the mud'
?coop by scdop and depositing It on i
?cows, to be towed1 away somewhere
and dumped, or perhaps scooped out
' and haulM off to flU hollows.
' The plan to use the sediment from
the choking river 'channel for the
reclamation of the flats was a stroke
of genius. It solved the channel prob
lem, cured a condition that menaced
the health of the District and even
tually provided a park the like of
which does not exist elsewhere. And
now, at the rate of a foot a year, the
Potomac continues to bring down ma
terial that can be used for other Alls,
to make other parks, perhaps; but,
whether used for such purposes or
not, it must be removed, else the Po
tomac will deteriorate into a minor
stream on which only craft of the
lightest draft can navigate.
The President and Congress.
The President stands to hear much
pleasant news about himself. Sena
tors and representatives, returned
from their fortnight at home, will bo
dropping in and telling him about
what the "boys" are saying about the
administration.
Their reports, there is reason to be
lieve, will all be to the good. Com
mercial travelers and others, who on
their trips talk politics as well as busi
ness, remark on how favorably they
find the people everywhere impressed
with the President. He suits them,
and they are very hearty In pro
claiming the fact. They are wishing
him success, and expecting lilm to
achieve it.
But the legislators did not hear as
pleasant things said about themselves.
The popular tone about Congress is
critical. It is probably a little unjust.
Sufficient allowance has not been
made for the size of the order pre
sented last April, when Congress met
and the country, ?till under the spell
of the previous November, was ex
pecting that a legislative miracle
would be wrought.
Miracle-workers seldom appear on
Capitol Hill, and none appeared this
time. So that having to tackle an
unusually large order in the every
day way. with everyday means, and
under everyday direction, Congress
did not make the progress demanded.
But that is old stuff. Back on the
Job now, and aware of the popular
disappointment. Congress has the op
portunity, and should feel the spur, to
quicken its pace and improve its rec
ord for use next November. It ought
to take a leaf out of the President's
book and win only applause.
In any arrangements of organized
business control of their own products
it may be hoped that farmers will be
content with quick sales and small
proflts and not imitate sinful specu
lators who have tried to corner the
market.
President Harding has arranged an
opportunity for a number of diplo
mats to be remembered in history as
peacemakers and not as light pro
moters.
Airships and radio have already
brought nations closer together than
ever before. The adjustment of oon
dltlons to meet new relations Is in
progress.
King George's amnesty for Irish
prisoners will make this year's holi
day greetings in the British Isles
something memorable.
Every effort Is being made to relieve
the league of nations of apprehensions
concerning the possibility of a com
petitive or imitative organization.
The "dove of peace" has at least j
been persuaded to stop cooing senti
ment and talk business.

Who's Who Conference
XVI?M. Albert Sarraut
f
PROBABLY no delegate at the
arms and far eastern confer
ence understand! more thor
oughly the Paclflo situation
than M. Albert Sarraut, member of the
French delegation. His knowledge of
the subject was recognised by the
conference when it appointed him a
member of the committee that is to
consider the proposed abolition of
extraterritoriality In China.
Newspaper man, lawyer and educat
or, M. Sarraut has studied conditions
In the far east at close range. He has
been governor general of Indo-Chlna
?nd he so won the affection of the
ndo-Chlnese for France that, during
the war, it was sufficient to leave In
the colony 300 white soldiers for a
population of 25.000,000. As present
minister of the colonies, it is under
stood he has prepared a vast plan for
reorganization of the French colonies
and the development of their immense
resources. What this will mean, to
France best can be appreciated when
it Is considered that the combined
area of the colonies Is fourteen times
greater than that of France Itself, or
as large us the United States.
Born at Bordeaux, in 1872. M. Sar
raut has served his country with dis
tinction as statesman and soldier. At
the age of thirty he was undersecre
tary of stale. He collaborated with
M. Clemtnceau, and, later, he became
undersecretary of state in the min
istry of war. where he organized the
(irst aviation section of t*e army.
In 1911 he was appointed governor
general of Indo-Chlna. There he fol- I
lowed a courageous policy toward the
natives. He punished severely crimes
against humanity, but gave liberty
to the people. His administration is
credited with having stimulated and
aided a remarkable beginning In self
government in Indo-Chlna.
He was In France in 1914, preparing
to return to Asia, when war broke
out. M. Vivlani appointed him minis
ter of public education, and. until the
end of 1915, he administered the na
tional system of education with great
success, notwithstanding many school
buildings had been converted into
hospitals anif thousands of teachers
had gone to the front.
Then, as the fury of the war brought
France into her darkest hours, M.
Sarraut volunteered for military ser
vice. lie was appointed a second lieu
tenant and. later, he participated in
the battles of Bois le Pretre and Ver
dun. At Verdun he received the war
cross for gallant action.
The presence of M. Sarraut in Indo
Chlna was regarded by the govern
ment as of such importance that he
was recalled from the trenches and
sent back to Nanoi. Here, again, his
administration was destined to be a
conspicuous one. Within a short time
he was able to send to France 140,000
men and a variety of raw materials.
In 1918 he returned to France, but
not to rest upon the laurels he had

won. M. Mlllerand Invited him to
enter the cabinet as minister of colo
nies, thus meeting' the wishes of the
French colonials. The appointment
was well received by the public and
he was generally regarded as the
right man in the right place.
He has been returned successively
as minister of colonies by M. Leygues
and by M. Brland, the present pre
mier.
Since early youth M. Sarraut had
followed the double career of news
paper man and lawyer, and. while this
ts his first visit to the United States,
he has written extensively on Amer
ican topics. In fact, his first book
was a study of the American system
of government.
At one time he was one of the prin
cipal editors of the powerful Journal
I.a Depeche, which exerts great In
fluence throughout southern France.
His brother. Senator Maurice Sarraut.
one of the moat influential members
of the senate, Is the manager of this
publication.
M. Sarraut is an art critic of recog
nized ability. If he has a hobby it
Is the collecting of paintings. But
his hours for recreation and gratify
ing personal whims are few. His life
Is given to France, and his ambition
Is to bring about a development of
her'colonies on such a scale that they
will be able to contribute effectively
to the raising of a new France from
the ashes of the war.
EDITORIAL DIGEST
Gentlemen's Agreements.
While ithe Idea of an "association of
cations" is greeted with enthusiasm
by most American papers, one ele- ?
ment of the plan as projected by
President Harding is rather freely
criticised. This is the "radical de
parture," to quote the Philadelphia
Public L?dge (independent), "from
the .theory of the diplomacy of the
past that written alliances and trea
ties were necessary among' nations."
Repudiation of this theory consti
tutes, in the opinion of this writer,
"one of .the cardinal principles of the
Harding program."
"What Mr. Harding is aiming at,"
the Christian Science Monitor (Bos
ton, independent); says, "is a substi
tution of a gentlemen's agreement for
a definite treaty." Supplanting for
mal pacts by "understandings" will
have .two advantages, as the Pitts
burgh Dispatch (independent) views it;
it will "avoid possible difficulties over
ratification," and "as for effective
ness, an understanding reached in each
instance by frank discussion and
agreement and backed by popular
opinion will be infinitely stronger
than any treaty that may at any time
be treated as a scrap of paper if
found disadvantageous."
Dependence upon "the common
sense of most" to keep "fretful realms
In awe." however, will not prove very
practical in operation, in the opinion
of many editors. The Memphis Xew?
Scimitar (independent) recognizes
that "a round table discussion, such
as the association of nations would
engage in, without authority to pass
upon the merits of the questions un
der consideration, might accomplish
some good," but, as the Pittsburgh
Sun (democratic) says, "it is more
generally understood every day that
a ltag-ue to which nations do not
?(.'legate authority cannot exercise
authority." "Until President Harding
can prove" that "the millennium has
really arrfved," the Oklahoma City
Oklahoman (democratic) thinks
"many Americans will insist that any
agreement in regard to matters vital
to the welfare of this country must
be drawn up tn definite written form,
properly signed by the representa
tives of the participating cations and
ratified as required by law," for
"when that is done there will be back
of thei agreement sufficient moral and
physical force, if necessary, to make
it mean something." The Indianapolis
News (independent) also feels that
"treaties would be greatly preferable,
and much more effective?a much
safer reliance."
But the Chicago News (independ
ent) reminds this group of objectors
that "experience has demonstrated
that international agreements actual
ly may amount to less than nothing,
and that even definite treaties are
sometimes quite worthless." Cer
tainly this country "remembers the
most solemn obligations that the na
tions of the world had with Germany
and the manner In which she tore
them to bits when she thought it to
her interest to discard them," the
Allentown (Pa.) Call (independent)
observes, and with the substitution
of "moral obligation" for the old
idea of treaty restraints the Call be
lieves the United States is ready to
declare that "the word of each mem
ber nation is good enough" and that
after discussion of and agreement
upon "the most vital questions it will
not be necessary to nail them down
with treaties." The Charleston (W.
Va.) Mail (republican) sees in "the
moral sentiment of the world" a
"potent force" ,which will hold na
tions "in honor bound to carry out"
the agreements which they reach
"voluntarily" through the confer
ences of the association of nations."
Certainly "nobody fears that any
agreement made at the present con
ference will not be faithfully ob
served," the Indianapolis Star (inde
pendent republican) declares, and
"the same power of public opinion
will operate in regard to other pro
posals that might come up from time
to time.
ThlB "high sense of international
honor is a fine ideal," but the Roa
noke World-News (democratic) finds
that the difficulty lies in the fact that
"the nations of the world haven't any
such international honor yet," so "we
can't count too largely upon It."
Gentlemen's agreements "not only
have no legal force," but, according
to the San Francisco Chronicle (in
dependent). "hardly any actual ef
fect," especially "when neither of the
'gentlemen' will let his countrymen
know precisely what agreement has
been made." Then there is the fur
ther difficulty, the Norfolk Virginian
?Pllot (Independent democratic) sug
Sests, "of keeping the agreeing na
ons gentlemanly." Gentlemen's
agreements, "with ?hitting admin
istrations, shifting cabinets and
?hitting popular passions," would. In
the opialon of the New York,World
(democratic), be Ahe "most effective
agency of international distrust and
discord that could be contrived," for
the White House would be "sole ar
biter," and the International rela
tions of the world would be "at the
mercy of every presidential election
in the United States."
Twisted Facts.
One of the favorite arguments of
those enthusiasts who would have the
United States disarm completely and
immediately is the statement that
wars and preparations for war now
take 93 cents out every tax dollar
paid to the government.
| As a matter of fact, the Army and
Navy of the United States, urider the
present appropriations acts, receive a
little less than 19 cents out of every
tax dollar. This represents the total |
possible saving, even if every vestige |
of Army and Navy were abolished.
The 74 cents remaining co\^rs obli
gations incurred in wars that have
been fought, and which must be paid
out of tax money regardless of any
present or future action in repsect of
armed force.
Among these Items are the Interest
on the liberty bond issues, compensa
tion for disabled soldiers, vocational
education, the civil war pension list,
maintenance of soldiers' homes and
so on.
Reduction of armament, as suggest
ed in the American plan, would, of
course, result in the saving of many
millions of dollars each year and the
benefit must be estimated in its prop
er proportion among the other excel
lent results expected to accrue from
the adoption of the plan.
But figures regarding the cost of
wars as they appear in the national
budget, should be read with a clear
understanding of their meaning. It is
a good plan to keep all the facts
about the reduction of armament
straight, and it is easy to get them
twisted. And twisted facts are diffi
cult things to deal with if the public
once accepts them.?Milwaukee Senti
nel (republican).
Learning to Talk.
Addressing a conference of teachers
of English, Miss Alice M. Reynolds,
vice president of a bank in Mil
waukee, expressed an opinion that
will be commended by everybody who
labors to prevent the deterioration of
English speech. She said:
"Financial institutions require that
their employes, especially those who
come in contact with the patrons of
the bank, shall have a cultural back
ground. Oral accuracy, which banks
are coming to insist upon, can come
only through a substitution of real
English?high-brow English. If you
will?for the gutter argot which so
many otherwise excellent employes
have picked up. This can be accom
plished only through a knowledge of
the best English literature."
The English language possesses a
very definite construction, and the
construction is far simpler than that
of the Latin language. With the ob
servance of the rules of construction
speech may be made clear and exact,
and if speech cannot possess these
possibilities it is of little value.
Years ago we had the theory of
English speech, but not the required
practice. Now we have the practice,
but not the necessary knowledge of
the laws governing it'. The blame can
not be charged wholly to the schools.

come awake to the needs of a better

tongue better teaching of English
also will come.?New York Herald
