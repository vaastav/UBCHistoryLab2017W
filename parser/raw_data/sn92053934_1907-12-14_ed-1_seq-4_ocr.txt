A St. Petersburg correspondent of

scription of the marriage of Sinjawski,
one of three young men who were
tried by court martial for attempting
to assassinate the czar, and Kit Pur

prison in the presence of' the wardens
and was celebrated by a regularly or
dained priest The young man's re
quest to have the ceremony witnessed
by two men who were excuted with
him a few hours later was denied. As
an act of mercy the thrqe men were
allowed to be together for a little
while, and the newly made husband
was placed where he. could see his
wife and she could see him. At 3
o'clock the next morning the young
men were taken in a closed wagon to
a point on the seashore, where they
were, executed. The feelings of the
people of this country have become
blunted by horrors, but a shudder ran
through the whole community when
it became know that these suspects,
against whom no case had been estab

Save the Mother Songs. .
With the Christmas holidays ap
proaching, Chicago has a new fad the
collection of mother songs. The time
and affection that used to be lavished
by society matrons on old 'china and
toy terriers is now being spent to bet
ter purpose in rescuing from oblivion
the old familiar lullabies whleh were
sung to cradled children by genera
tions of American mothers in long past
winter twilights. Some of these are
known to everyone, but many of the
most beautiful are fast being forgotten
and might be lost forever if they were
not noted down, together with the mel
odies, in the dainty note books of the
collectors. Foreign songs are being re
served in the same way, some of them
very rare and beautiful, but the prime
, favorites will always be the familiar
ones such as the German
"Schlaf. Kindlein. schlaf,
Dein Vater hut' die Scnaf, v .
Dein Mutter schiittelt's Baumelein,
Da Fallt herab ein Traumelein,
Schlaf, Kindlein, schlaf;"
Or the Swedish. "Rida, Rida, Ranka,
Hasten heter Blanka," in which the
boy is told to ride his rocking horse
while he may, for when he grows up
tho happiness of youth will have de
parted. Less known melodies of Nor
wegian and Italian and Russian and
Bohemian mothers have found their
way into the collections even some of
the American Indian cradle songs
chants that were first heaid in the
lodges of the Algonquins and Sioux
and Dakotahs in the forest clearings of
Michigan and Wisconsin and along the
banks of the Missouri.

The list of newspapers printing the
president's annual message in full this
year is , very small. The only New
York naner which printed it entire
appears to have been the Tribune. Pa
pers like the New York Times and
Sun cut the message down one-half or
more. The World, Herald, and other
metropolitan journals printed a "still
smaller fraction. It used to be that no
daily newspaper of high standing would
ever fail to present these annual mes
sages in full to Its readers. It is only
since Mr. Roosevelt came into power
that the practice has started and be
come quite general of cutting down the
official deliverances of the president,
and this Is due simply to the inordinate
length of his deliverances. Their de
mands upon newspaper space have be
come simply intolerable.

MINORITY IN NEW
(Special Washington Correspondence of
The Argus.)
The. Sixtieth congress opened k. witn
the best Imaginable opportunities for
the Democratic minority. It is prac
tically a unit on all issues. In the
caucus of the house of representatives
there was not one voice raised against
the re-election of John Sharp Wil
liams as leader. Hon. Champ Clark, a
veteran representative with seven
terms to his credit, said the day before
this letter was written: "The Repub
licans are now divided on the sort of
legislation that should be passed, espe
cially iu regard to the currency. On
the other hand, the Democrats are
united. Because ofUhe much smaller
majority held by the Republican party
in the house we shall have more
chance of outvoting it ion Important
measures. The truth of the matter is
that the Republicans have been found
out. For ten years they have been
preaching that the Dingley tariff was
responsible for all our wonderful
prosperity. The Dingley tariff Is still
with us, but the prosperity has been
given a blow. If things go on the way
they have been going, Mr. Bryan will

States as sure as you are "born."
Evidences of Republican Distension.
Mr. Clark has beeu somewhat ridi
culed for describing the Democratic
party in congress as anited and the
Republican party as split into factions.
Let me take up the case of the latter
party first.
President Roosevelt Insists that he Is
not a candidate -, for the presidency.
About half his party are trying to
force a renominatiou upon hlra, the
other half plotting secretly to avert
what they rightly think would be a
fatal blow to their party's success.
The president writes Secretary Cor
telyou that there will be prompt cur
rency legislation In v this congress.
Senator Al!tsda;Speaker Cannon and
ail the prominent leaders of the party
announce that theV probably be
no currency legislation, or If any is
completed it will at the very last
moments of the sessVMi.

She looked at him with an intent
ness that was rather diseoncertinsr. ' I
"Tell me." she said, "why should
you, knowing all these things as you
do. care to travel with us?" j
Lancaster regarded her for a time in
thoughtful silence. Dare he tell her
the truth? He looked into her clear
gray eyes and decided to risk it.
"Shall f tell you the real reason?" he
asked. .,
"Why, yes, of course," she replied,
with a little note of surprise- in her
voice.
"Well, then," said Lancaster fcturdi
ly. "it was because of you."
The color deepened in her cheeks.
"Oh!" she said, with sudden compre
hension. Her eyes fell. She was ab
traOtedly pulling her gloves to cover
her embarrassment.
"You remember that evening at the
hotel In Cologne," Lancaster went on.
"when you and I were partners a'.
whist? I joined your party the next
morning. : I wanted to bo with you
just to lie near you."
"I I rather wish you hadu't told
me, she said uneasily.
"Would you rather I had fibbed po
litely?" he asked.
"No-o," she replied slowly.
"You see," Iiucaster explained, "I'd
been poking about the continent all by
my lonesome, and, to tell the truth, I'd
not been having a very hilarious time
of it. And that night at Cologne" II
paused.
"Yes. that night at Cologne?" she
prompted.
"It seemed," he said very gravely,
"as if you fitted into a uiche In my

Cannon assures an interested public
that neither measure can secure at
tention. Tariff revislonls demanded by one
third of the Republican members of
congresn and probably four-fifths of
the constituents of all. but the speaker
and two-thirds of the members of
house and senate, being tied to the
protected industries, bitterly oppose it.
The president's admirable plan of
Interior waterways lias the opposition
alike of the speaker and Mr. Roose
velt's personal candidate for mayor of
Cleveland, Mr. Barton, who holds the
commanding position of chairman of
the committee before which the propo
sition must le brought.
It is fair to say that the clash be
tween the divergent forces in the Re
publican party would better be de
scribed as a growing hostility among
the men at the capitol to the man at
the White House. Speaker Cannon has
his forces well In hand. There will
not be much apparent divergence of
opinion between Republicans in debate
unless the president is able to find
oppe stronger spokesman In house or
senate- than he now possesses. The
general impression now is that the pro
Iframme of legislation for this session
will be dictated at the capitol and that
it will be as brief a programme as pos
sible. As for the Democrats, they are, of
course, because of - their small num
ler, impotent to accomplish any legis
lation, though they can block some.
They will be ridiculed as beiuz a party
of negation, opposing everything and
accomplishing nothing. But what else
can the party of opposition be? They
will oppose almost as a unit the pro
jected asset currency law: They will
press as a unit a demand for Immedi
ate revision of the tariff. At least
three representatives on the Democrat
ic side will Introduce bills of the great
est importance to the newspaper pub

sectional. 1 recalled also the fact that
Republican newspapers haw? been In
clined to scoff at the Democratic party
because, while 'it got the majority of
its electoral votes from the south, it
had never selected a southern man as
its standard bearer in the presidential
battles. The hitler fact is true, yet
there are some people who know that
if eight months ago the south had de
sired to rally about a truly southern
man, and a man who had shown un
failing loyalty to the principles of the
Democracy of today, such a man might
easily have been nominated. I have
some reason to believe that Mr. Bryan
himself would have looked with favor
upon such a nomination, but in per
sonal conversation with uistinguisuea
senators from Virginia, from South
Carolina, from Alabama and from
Texas, two of whom at least might
have been considered as possible candi
dates, anil from correspondence with
certain Democratic governors of south-

And speaking of the geographical
distribution of votes recalls the fact
that a New York newspajer which
seemed very much distressed lest any
Democrat should be nominated for the
presidency with a show of winnlnir
.Las been finding great comfort in the
daily publication of a map showing
the gradual loss of the west and the
north to the Democratic party.
Daily it lays stress upon the fact
that in 1802 Mr. Bryan worked and
voted for Weaver in Nebraska, the
ropulist uominee for the presidency.
It carefully, however, refrains from
mentioning the fact that he- was ask
ed to do so by the Democratic nation
al committee and that largely as a
result of bis efforts, the electoral vote
of the state was given to Weaver In
stead of to Benjamin Harrison, a re
sult by which Grover Cleveland profit
ed greatly.
Was that bad service for the cause
of Democracy?
It emphasizes the truth that Mr. Bry
an has not carried Nebraska either for
himself or for any other candidate
since 1896. It Ignores the truth that
the only Democrat who ever did carry
Nebraska was Mr. Bryan. And it has
not expressed any. horror or indigna

did not carrv New York.'
