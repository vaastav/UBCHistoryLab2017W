The ninth scries of frames In the bowling

Vnlnnlilc Tliinic for Is.
How many pople we rrect these days
who complain of tired, wornout feellng3
and seem to be very mueh 'under tho
weather." There seems to b" an epidemic
of ill-health and an unusually large num
ber of people are feeling and looking weak
and slckij. But there is fortunately a
way to oercomo thee miserable feelings
and regain lost health and strength.
Thousands or people hao discovered this
way and many of them are giving others
the benefit of their upenence Here is an
interesting opinion on the subject:
Mr. II B Toale. of 432 DKalb avenue,
Brooklyn, sas- "In the spring and sum.
mer 1 was formerly a constant sufferer
from weakness and nervous debility. I
tried many remedies but ob-alned no re
lief until I began taking Duff's Pure Mali
Whiskey. Since I commenced using it, my
friends aro astonished at my Improved ap
pearance." The above opinion has been selected from
thousands of others, all testifying to the
ame effect. It proves bejond any ques
tion that for building up the sjstem and
imparting new life to weak, weary people
Duffy's Pura Malt "Whiskey Is simply un
equaled. It purifies the blood, quickens
tho circulation, promotes digestion, cures
co-istlpatlon and gives new life to evry
part of tho bodj. AH grocers and drug
gists keep Duff s Pure Malt, but In pur
chasing care should bo taken, to guard
against inferior imitations.

A REPORT BY 0LNEY.
Transmitted to Congrc IVlth the
President' Mcsnajte Observa
tions ns to Culm.
Washington, Dec. 7. For the first time
within tho memory of tho oldest officials
tho secretary of state has made a regular
report to tho president for transmission to
congress like the reports of other mem
bers of the cabinet. This report was laid
before congress to-day as an appendix to
the president's message. It treats on many
dctalls of our relations during the past
j ear with foreign governments that cither
were not touched upon at all In tho mes
sago or were more briefly treated.
Under the head of Spain, Secretary Olnej
has much to say In regard to Cuba, nnd in
his report he sets out In great detail the
story of the growth of the rebellion, the
present stato of affairs on the Island
and other facts upon which the president
bases his broid statement and conclusions
The secretary's estimate of the present
situation is disclosed In the following para
graph, made after a preliminary stafment
ot the destruction ot the industrial re
sources of Cuba:
"From whatever point of view we regard
the matter. It Is Impossible not to discern
that a state of things exists at our doors
alike dangerous to good relations, destruct
ive of legitimate commerce, fatal to the
Industrial resources of Cuba, and most
vexatious and trving because entailing
upon this government excessive burdens in
its domestic administration and in Its out
ward relations This situation cannot In
definitely continue without growing still
worse, and the time may not be far dis
tant when the United States must serious
lv consider its rights and Interests as well
as Its International duties."
As be-inng upon the question of recogni
tion of the Insurgent", which Is to come in
some shape before congress, the following
statement from Secretary Olney Is of Im
portance In explaining his reasons for de
clining recognition.
"So far as our information shows, there
is not onlv no cffeitlvo local government
bv the Insurgents In the territory they
overrun, but there ts not even a tangible
pretense to established administration anv
wnere Their organisation, contincd to
shifting exigencies of military operations
of the hour, is nom.idh . without definite
centers and lacking the most elementnrv
features of municipal government. There
nowhere appears tho nucleus ot statehood.
Th machinery for exercising the legiti
mate rights and powers of ovcrclgntv ami
responding to the obligations which do
fncto overelgntv entails In the face of
eqtal rights of other states Is consplcuous-
Jj lacking."

Topeka, Dec. 7. (Special.) A decision
was handed down in the federal court to
day in the Santa Fe receivership case in
which the motion to remand the case to
the Jefferson countv- district court for trial
was sustained. The opinion was written
by Judge Foster, and was concurred in by
Judge Thaver. of the United States circuit
court of appeals, wno heard the argument
the last time.
The decision will In no way affect the
property. In accordance with the stipula
tion entered into between the attorneys on
each side and the order of Judge Myers, as
printed In to-dav's Journal, the receiver,
ex-Senator Martin, will not take charge
of the property. It will remain in the
hands of the company.
Under the provisions of the stipulation
the case "will next come up before Judgs
Mvcrs, of the Jefferson county court. Ar
rangement was made to-day for a hearing
at Leavenworth nxt Friday. The argu
ment will be based on a demurrer lll0d by
Attornejs Hlte and Keeler, representing
the state, to the answer of the companv's
attorneys to the original petition. The an
swer charges that the stock of the compa
ny was not held by aliens at the time of
tho purchase of the property, that the alien
act was never regularly passed, that f it
was. it was unconstitutional. The demur
rer is filed on the grounds that the answer
does not state facts sufficient to constitute
a defense.
This suit will go through the courts on
the hearing of the demurrer. This brings
up all the points involved. No matter which
wav Judge Mvers decides the question Fri
day, It will be taken to tho state supreme
court, and from there to the United States
supreme court.
"When court convened this morning At
torney Charles Blood Smith, representing
the Union Trustl Companv, of New York,
asked permission to withdraw tho inter
plea filed by him, on account of the stipu
lation which had been entered into. The
request was granted. Then Judge roster
announced that the motion to remand the
caso to the Jefferson county district court
would be sustained, and that his written
opinion, concurred in by Judge Thayer,
would be filed with the clerk. Tho following
are the main points of the decision of
Judge Foster:
"The motion to remand the caso to the
state courts presents the simple question
of jurisdiction. That question is ever pres
ent in all judicial proceedings, and courts
will at all times take notice of objections
to their jurisdiction, whether the come
from the parties to tho litigation, or of
their own volition.
"This action, commenced In the district
court of Jefferson county by the state, to
forfeit tho real estate, the roadbed and
right-of-vvav of defendant in said countv,
is predicated on an act of the legislature
ot 1S91 (Lh. 3), entitled, "An act In regnrd
to aliens and to restrict their rights- to ac
quire and hold real estate, and to provide
for tho disposition of tho lands now owned
bj non-resident aliens.'
"The section of the act reads as follows
'Section 2. That no corporation or associa
tion, more than 20 per centum of the utock
of which is, or may be, owned bj any
peron, or persons, corporation or associa
tion, not a citizen of tho United States, or
of Mime district or territory thereof, shall
hereafter acquire, hold or own any real
estate in the state of Kansas '
"By section 5 of the act It Is provided
that real estate held In violation of the
act shall bo forfeited to the Mate of Kan
sas, and makes it the dutj of the countv
attornev of any county in whith such real
estate is situated to enforce such forfeit
ure in a civil action brought in the name
of the stato as plaintiff. It further provides
that the court shall appoint a receiver to
take charge of (he real estate
"The sixth section of the act provides as
follows- 'If, upon the final hearing of
stich action, tho court shall find that anv
portion of the real estate described In the
Itetition is held or owned In violation of
this act. the court shall adjudse such real
estate forfeited to the state, and shall or
der the samo appraised, sold and convejed
bv the sheriff in parcel-, not exceeding 1m1
acres each, in the same inanntr provided
by law for the f.ile of real est.ite upon ex
ecution '
"By section 7 It is provided how- the
moncv arising from the sale of the for
feited land-, hall be disposed of, that, after
compensating the receiver, piving the
iots of the action, and allowing the coun
tv attornev 10 per centum for his services
the residue shall be paid to the owner of
the real estate at the timo of the forfeit
ure. If not "O paid within thirtj daj-. it
shall lie paid into the trcasurv of the state
of Kansas sublet t to the order of tho per
son adjudged to be entitled thereto.
"This iatute is. In some respect", a re
markable one. ami if it means all that has

versy Involved, we are not now concerning
ourselv es
"The attornev general. v.-ith a fairness
commendable In an ofiuer presenting to
the court a cae of sucn importance to the
state, and to the rights of individuals and
corporations, has set forth in full in the
amendments to the pettfon all the mate
rial facts touching this proceeding. In ad
dition to tho averments necessary to bring
the case within the provisions of the act
of the legislature, that more than -0 pr
centum of the stock of the defendant is
owned and held bv non-resident aliens,
etc , he has set forth ard cited the act of
cong-ess of March 3, lv3. granting lands
to the state of Kansas in trust for the
Atchison, Topeka .t Santa Fe Railroad
Companv. and impo-Ing certain duties and
obligations upon the railroad companv to
the general government in the transporta
tion of troops and property of the United
States, from which is quoted the following
paragrapn:
" 'That said lands hereby granted to said
state shall be subject to the dipo-a! of
the legislature thereof for the purposes
aforesaid, and no other and the said rail
roads and branches shall be and remain
public highways for the use. of the gov
ernment of the United States, free from
all toll and other charges upon the trans
portation of any property or troops of the
United States '
"The plaintifT further sets forth the ac
ceptance of these lands bv the state In
trust, and the acceptance of the provisions
of the act and its obligations bv the rail
road companv.
"It further alleges that the defendant
corporation, whose property is sought to
be forfeited in this proceeding, i-. part of
a great sjstem of railroads formerlyowned
and operated bv the Atchison, Topeka &
Santa Fo Railroad Companv. and now
owned by the defendant corporation, ex
tending into and through the states ot
Kansas, Slissouri, Iowa, Illinois and Col
orado, and the territories of New Mexico
and Oklahoma, said corporation being en
gaged in interstate commerce, in the trans
portation of the mails of the United States
and as a postal and military route, under
various acts of coniri'-s.
"The pla-ntiff further proceeds to show
by apt averments that by virtue of cer
tain legal proceedings in this court, the
preTn defendant ccmpuiry has succeeded
to all the rights, privileges ami imm-uritits
granted to, and to all the duties and obli
gations imosed upon, its predecessor in
the pDv-e-Aion and operation of its rail
road, and thereupon pra the court to
grart judgment of forfeiture, or such re
lief under the a' t of the legislature as tho
richts of all parties will warrant.
"Tho case is removed bv the defendant to
this court on the ground that it Is a civil
action anm- under the constitution, laws
and tieaties of the United States. This
loads us to a brief examination of the net
of eongre-s of .Man h 3. Iii, as amended
in lSW. concernlrg the jurisdiction of fed
eral courts, the ngret of removal of causes
to fit h courts, and some of tho decisions
of tho courts touching these question
"It is well known ro the legal profession
fHit recent decisions of the supreme court
of the t rated States, have lahl down this
rule: The circuit court of the United S'ates
has no jurisdiction, either original or by re
moval from a state court, of a suit as one
arising under the constitution. Jaws or
treaties of the United States, unless that
appears by the plaintiff's statement of his
ow n c lam '
"Tho facts set forth do not tend to sfiow
any claim arising under any act of con
gress, the constittiti- or treaty of the
United States, but rather to foreshadow or
anticipate a possible aefense to the pro
ceedings by the railroad company growing
out ol tho act of corgress of March 3,
1S3. That defense Is available to tho de
fendant in tbo state court and, being a
federal question, can be carried to the su
preme court of tho United States if the
right Is denied.
"Counsel havo especially called the
court's attention to the case or California
vs. Pacific ItaMway Company, IIS United
Sta-tcs ar.nl 127 United States, also to the
Union Pacific removal cases, 113 United
States, but. In my view of those cases,
they have no important bearing on the
question bere.
"If wo wero considering the general mer
its of the controversy between tho state
and the defendant corporation. Instead of
the question of jurisdiction, thoso cases
would have a material bearing upon tho
questions t isiue.
'For the reasors above given, I reach
the conclusion that this- court is without
jurisdiction, and thus case must bo remand
ed 'to the state court."
Followiifg are the main points in Judge
Thai er'H opinion, concurring in the opinion
of Judge Foster.
"I concur in the foregoing views ex
pressed bv Judge Foster. While the ju
diciary act of March 3, 1S75 (IS Stat. 470, c.
137). remained In force, it was settled bv
repeated adjudications that when a case
was removed from a state to u federal
court, because of the existence of a federal
question, the right to remove would be up
held, provided the record, when lodged in
the federal court, showed cither that the
plaintiff based his right to relief, or that
the defendant predicated his defense, on
some provision of the federal constitution,
or on some provision of a federal law or
treatv (Railroad Co v. Mississippi. 102
U. S 13S). Thus rule, that a case might be
removed when a federal question was
raised by either partv. and the fact that a
defendant, under the ai t of March 3. 187-;,
wa privileged lo plead to the declaration
or complaint before a petition for removal
was tiled made it po-sible. under th it act.
to bring upon the record anj federal ques
tion which cither pirlv desired to raise,
before the right of removal was execiscd
But the doctrine no longer prevails that
the whole record mav be considered, in-
t hiding any allegatiors found In the peti
tion for removal, in order to discover the
existence of a federal question.
"The case of Tennessee vs Union and
Planter's bank, supra, was full and care

the United States in the light of the judi

Railroad Co. v. St. Paul & Northern Pa
cific Railway Co. 32 U. S. app. 372: Id, 13,
C O. A.. 167) The case in question must,
therefore. he regarded as establishing
rule of decision which no inferior federal
court can Ignore.
"Appljmg the doctrine In question to the
caso in hand, it is evident that the case
was not removable to the federal circuit
court. The state of Kansas based its right
to relief excluivel on the act of the 'cg
islature ot that state which was passed in
1S91. It asserted no right, title, privilege,
claim or immunit under the constitution,
laws or treaties of the United Stato, The
dei titration tiled by the state does show,
th it owing to the character of the property
involved, the defendant companv mav, and
probably will, interpose a defense to tho
btut. founded upon the provisions of cer.
tain federal statutes, to-wlt the act ot
congress of March 3, 1?G3. 12 Stat 772. c 0.
and article 6, of the federal constitution,
but whether it will assert vuch defenses
or not remains to be seen. Thee defenses
are not et presented in such a form that
Hie judicial power Is capable ot acting on
them, and the ma be waived when a pica
to the declaration is interposed.
"To fullv subserve the purpose of their
creation, the federal court, when appealed
to for relief, should invariably exercise
and uphold the jurisdiction with which
they have been clearly vested, but they
oughti not to usurp a. jurisdiction which
does not of right belong to them, by a
strained construction ot existing laws or
Juillcial decisions. I concur with Judge
Poster that tho cre at bar mut be re.
mantled to the state court, and It should
be remanded to th it court In the condition
In which it was received If any ordr
have been made while the case was pend.
Ing in this forum, they should be vacated
before the order of remand Is entered.
