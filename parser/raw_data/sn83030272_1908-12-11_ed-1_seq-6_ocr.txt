The 8tkd Pflnninn Scandal
r A number of newspapers in different
in commenting
Yp of tho country
upon President ROOSBVKLTS recent out
i break base their observations upon the
alleged reprehensible course which THK
1 SUN ha pursued in relation to tho r
called Panama 6candnls Even so intel
7 ligent nnd respectable I paper nq the
Nashua Telegraph takes this ground
and delivers itself of strictures which
6uld be none too severe were there
t any justification for them in facts rilE
6tJN has never printed anything about
u Panama matter nnd Preident
ROOSEVELT never charged it with doing
i yo Our opinion of thnt Kouallod scan
dal from its inception has been that it
L fcad no basis whatever and thai in so I
I t a it was sought to Implicate Mr
i DOUGLAS ROBINSON and Mr CHARLES
P TArr it was simply a grotenque out
rf ge It is all the same made the oc
casion of much violent rhetoric against
VtJi paper mostly negligible in respect
of its source Indeed THE SUN has
cause to be grateful to the reputable
press of the country at large for the jus
r tipq and propriety of its commentary

With hia doubtless distinguished personal
ppearanoe
153 f A Slur on the Jucllclnry
In tlie first rapid perusal document
of such Inordinate length a President
tQEvELTs last message It inevitably
i happens that many observations of im
portance will escape criticism
1 Prowl of the message which has
1 not yet received the condemnation
illel1 it merits is that which deals with
t eas1 in which the courts have declared
of the Legislature or acts of Con
gresa to be unconstitutional i
ucnttutona I
iKi The ourta are t be blamed says the
IreIdent when they fail to recognize
L uncfer Government like ours the delib
r erate judgment of the majority as a mat
t tor of legitimate policy when duly ex
I 2 I pressed by the Legislature Such law
A fully expressed and deliberate judgment
< should b given effect by tho courts
gven
t Mve in the extreme and exceptional
flaSca where there has been a clear vio
lation of a constitutional provision
lLnytMng like frivolity or wantonness in
r fctpsetting such clearly taken governmental
action f i a grave offence against the
z republic
Of course it i The courts hardly
to tell them that
needed the President tl the tat
nee i talk of this sort from such 1
source i the implication which it in
volVes It implies that the courts have
been in the habit of frivolously and
z l rafltonly declaring solemnly enacted
r statutes unconstitutional The as
4 sttut unfounded in fact
r iumption is utterly unfounde fac
rJ4he law reports abound in decision
which assert it to b the duty of the
f judiciary t uphold all legislation how
1 ever unwise inexpedient or unobJec
tionable it may otherwise appear t b
unless it is manifestly enacted in disregard
i regard of the commands of the Consti
tution When the courts do pronounce
i a statute invalid on this ground it is
= l only in obedience t the peoples will as
M5I ony obeienc poplos 1 o
Ic > pr in fundamental law that
ifl to say in obedience to the Constitu
tion which the people have said shall
constitute the highest law and shall
jcontrol even the action of their own
1cthosen representatives in the Legisla
II iJtuxtee and Congrons
4 < Bo when President ROOHKVKLT in
3 forms Congress that a law should not
m be declared unconstitutional merely
r because i is unwise and improper he IA
giving utterance totno newly dicer
truth but merely doctrine of tho
Judicial eontructIon of statutes which
J > haa been recognized by the courts State
ad Federal ever since the foundation
J of our Government doctrine HO tin
J f questioned that its mere assertion in
c the manner in which tho President now
I asserts it is unjust to tho Judges for
the reason that his language suggests
I the imputation that they havo not here
tofore observed it with sufficient care
t This imputation has no foundation In
fact The courts arc not engaged as he
7 intimates Mln devising means to defeat
their the peoples will by the technicali
t s ties of strained construction In nine
h tenths of the cams In which statutes
have been adjudged unconstitutional it
will b found that the result has been
11 reached only because the Judges have
7 feltatthey could not decide otherwise
00MJaeaUy with their oath of office
1
which makes obcdlonco to the Consti
tution their Jlret and highest d t
To suggestion that there has been
anything liko wantonness or frivolity
in tho decisions of tho courts of this
country which have declared certain
laws null and void because their enact
ment was forbidden by tho Constitution
is simply preposterous There is no
conceivable excuse for it except utter
ignorance
Congress and the Marine Corps
It Is t b hoped that Congress will
soon reduce t law and order and clear
definition the status of the Marino
defniton to ttu
Corps That excellent and useful body
has boon seriously affected by the Prod
dents recent order banishing tho ma
rines from tho ships on which they
have served with usefulness and dis
tinction for more than a hundred years
For this order ho has abundant legal
authority Tho fac remains however
that no adequate provision has been
made for filling their places on ship
board or for organizing a system of
Independent transportation whereby
they may bo distributed among the
various posts and stations to which
they may bo hereafter assigned
Obviously the marines If they remain
a contingent of the navy must be em
ployed to garrison our navy yards and
to do dutYIn our colonial possessions
They can be ordered to Hawaii to Gjiam
to tim Philippines Ac Several thou
sands can be employed in this way and
there are about ten thousand of them
to bo disposed of A certain proportion
is already on the ground but under the
now arrangement the rest of the corps
must be parcelled out either ns r
enforcoments of established centres
or as original garrisons in new places
Barracks gna have t be built here or
enlarged there and vessels purchase
or chartered for purposes of transpor
tation AH of this entails expense
since the marines may no longer be
carried on our warships Of course
emergency expedients will servo for a
while but sooner or later a complete
machinery in this respect will be inevi
table and to this end Congress will be I
asked for the necessary appropria
tions While all this Is in process of ar
rangement tho forces on shipboard must
be recruited t the extent t which they
havo been depleted by the Presidents
and the services heretofore
order ad i ia srics hertfor
performed by the rrne ore to be
adequately discharged by their new
substitutes the recruits win have to b
very superior men ana susceptible of
I high order of training
There has been some talk of trans
ferring the whole marine corps to the
marne cors to
and this in would be
army some ways b
a mighty fine thing for that branch
Ten thousand accomplished and sea
soned Infantry would b a welcome
addition t our growing establishment
But the marines have their own system
of promotion Marine Lieutenants
Captains Majors Ac are much younger
than officers of the same rank in the
army The absorption of these ten
thousand men would clog the channels
of promotion sadly perhaps very un
justly and would undoubtedly arouse
a great deal of antagonism
Meanwhile the marines have been
excude from the warships and pend
ing arrangements for their distribu
tion the vacaijp places in the ranks
of the navy have to b filled and the
question of ways and means becomes
urgent I i all very well to issue an
irade to the accompaniment of tom
toms and loud huzzas but ten thousand
thoroughly trained men cannot be
eliminated by a stroke of the pen or
their plac filled by public outcry
Congress will have to take hold of the
business end of this matter at one time
or another and it seems to u that
Congress cannot act too soon
A Preliminary to Revision
What Mr TAn and Speaker CANON
talked about when they met in con
ference on Wednesday by request of
Mr TAn i only a matter of conjec
ture since neither of them will gratify
curiosity No one is more concerned
about the success of the next Admin
istration than Mr TAFT i himself and
it may b supposed that he wanted
t discuss with Mr CANNON who will
probably succeed himself a Speaker
the means to make tho Administration
a success
As the Congress now in session will
not take up the tariff and as in due
President TAFT will communi
course Prident wi cmmuni
cato to tho Sixtyflrst Congress his
views as t the form revision should
take that subject may not have coil
Bunied much of the time given t the
Interview at least not directly But
wo can understand how Mr TAFT after
assuring the per of his good will
and peaceful intentions if any assur
ance were necessary may have ven
tured t observe that the task of revising
vising the tariff would b less difficult
if the country were not forced to face
I deficit and that therefore he would
like t hear Mr CANNONS views on the
subject of appropriations by the Six
session tieth Congress at the short and final
6lon
At any rate whether l TAKT so
licited the information or Mr CANNON
volunteered it surely economy in ap
propriations ought to b much on the
Speakers mind these days and it
greatly concerns President ROOSF
VELTS successor There may be smart
and suspicious persona who expect
liberal appropriations at this session
of Congress upon the theory that tho
greater the need of revenue in the next
fiscal year the less disposition there
tf yea to diplUonther
would be to revise the tariff downward
from a fear of losing revenue that would
t o required meet a deficit No doubt
there are standpatters who take thin
view But Mr CANNON is much tod
wise to share i
The best protective tariff is one that
and stimulates
promote manufacturing ad stiuat
markets while it automatically produces
sufficient revenue for the expenses of
government In that sense tho Ding
Icy law under present conditions i I
not the best tariff law in spite of the
panegyrics of certain of its beneficiaries
md those who represent them in Wash
ngton I may be expedient to Ple
r
n l
vide BomoTjtrrt protection Jn tho revised
law but it does not follow that more
revenue could not b obtained by a
general and moderate downward revision
vision In fact tho making of tho tariff
law needed requires tho soundest and
most dollcato judgment To got the
Government into a holo by authorizing
largo expenditures of tho public reve
nues would bo 1 political as well as an
economic mistake that no Intelllgtm
friend of the protective tariff would
suffer to bq made i ho hnd any influence
at Washington >
Mr CANNON Is an intelligent friend
of tho protective tariff and wo have
no doubt that his Influence will bo used
at this session of Congre to keep tho
appropriations down and thus mnkq
the inevitable task of revision easier
for those who are charged with respon
sibility for it As ho said yesterday
U expenditures must bo safe and sane
The Department of Education
The Bureau of Municipal Research
not lon ago made a number of grave
charges against the Department of
Education Tho charges were In rein

bureau is presumably informed In
on effort to bring about the introduc

has investigated the budget apprppria

officials Part of the work of tho com

funds voted In the preceding year have
been used for the purposes for which
they were granted and to supply Infor

of the Bureau of Municipal Research has

C IH Ilnyi
From the National Ilctltw
We aro doing very well Indeed said
Mr Hays The various contractor a
in good spirits and wall abreast of their
go splrt wel nret
dates Indeed the financial disaster In
New York a year since was for us a bless
ing in disguise Largo numbers of men
have como north seeking work and our
labor difficulties which must have In
volved delay have been quite Incon
siderable Labor Is abundant and I
more productive at lower wage AI
ry our trains n running regularly
over the whole section 608 miles west of
Winnipeg Into Alberta The newly ar
rived settlers haw harvested a great
wheat crop great both In quantity and
quality greater still for the pro It Is
bringing At our Pacific terminal Prince
Rupert good progress IB being made and
I BOO no reason t doubt that by the
autumn of 1011 our first train will break
through t tidewater passing from the
Atlantic t the Pacific
A good deal la being Bald about the
very generous oven lavish expenditures
on your road and roadbed as t that pplnt
I should like your statement
Well said Mr Hays our expendi
tures havo not been excessive nor beyond
the measure of our obligations to the Gov
ernment and the community What we
require today and what the travelling
public means t have isa first class road
bed with such low gradients and wIde
curvatures that our trains will run at very
high speeds with perfect safety Our
grades are BO remarkable that a single
engine will haul the heaviest train from
tho head of the Great Lakes over the
Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Com
parisons are I know odious but they
are sometimes as in this case highly edu
cational We carry our road from Win
nipeg over the Rockies to Prince Rupert
with a maximum gradient of 21 feet to
the mile going went and 28 t the mile
going cast Such gradients would bo to
the credit of roads such as the Pennsyl
vania or the English Midland The
and the
grades are prairie grades only
Immense economy in hauling freights
with gradients 8 remarkable every
railway man must recognize We shall
be able t put 2000 tons of freight Into
Prince Rupert from Winnipeg behind a
single engine Just realize what that
statement involves for our settlers
Of the seven great railroad systems
which today cross the Rockies and reach
the Pacific the Union Pacific with g des
of 118 fet 4astbound and 105 westbound
comes nearest to us It would be difficult
to overestimate the millions of yearly
savings because of our advantage I

In other words the same engine could
haul up the maximum grade of the Grand
Trunk Pooiflo nearly four times more
Freight in 0 train than either the Get
Northern Northern Pacific or Union
Pacific over five Unite more than on the
Sat Fe and about seven times more
behauledup the Canadian
than can haule grade on Cna
dian Pacific These are very remark
able figures I am aware and I accept the
responsibility for put Uni them on record
You can read in those figures the reason
for what you describe a our generous
expenditures The interest on the cost
expndltur
of such a line will be returned to us ten
times over In the economy of ou opera
tme
tions and In the increased safety of our
passengers
penger our representative I see
tho point running at high speeds down
steep grades kills passengers while the
I cost of employing seven engines per train
kills dividends
on up grades kUs dhldend
Exactly you have now got the reply
lo the charge of extravagance And In
This connection I go 8 far as t say that
our easy gradients which aro due not only
or chiefly to our generous expenditures
but to our possession of the Yellow Head
Pa through the Rookies will In a few
years twist round a great portion of the
wheat export trade of the Northwest
and with the opening of the Panama
Canal In 1014 send wheat t Europe let
alone to Asia by way of the Pacific
That said the Interviewer is a most
plifv interesting suggestion which please a
ply present said Mr Hays the wheat
crop is either hurried to the ports on the
Great LakcaDuluth Fort William Chi
cago during the few weeks between
threshing and the closing of lake naviga
ion in November or it is held up for six
month In elevators at a considerable
cost or again if carried through to the
Eastern seaboard in winter when the St
Lawrence route Is closed by Ic the long
haul through heavy snows make the
operation difficult coolly and even die
strous both for the railway and the
farmer But westbound from Saskatch
ewsn and Alberta to Prince Rupert the
grades are elY there is very lit tie snow in
winter BO that when the Panama anal
pens In six years I expect to see Prince
Rupert one of the very great grain ports
Rupr world Such grades a oursI
oust again emphasize tat point are
detne t twist round the present cur
rants of trade with results which will b
very surprising to watch I have more
than once ventured watc prediction that
In my lifetime we shall haul t the Pacific
as much grain a we Bal haul to the
Atlantic and it may well be far more
But may not that diminish the earn
dIvIsions ings of the Grand Trunk on Its eastern
Oh no not appreciably M said Mr Hays
The volume of traffic coming out of the
new Northwest if we may Judge from
settlers swarming in
the wayetter are already B1aing
will throw far more business upon our
listing lines than they can possibly
handle The present cultivated area is
but 8000000 acres a mere patch this
on B farm of 800000000 acres As vet we
have but scratched the surface We shall
hve buterte
require very shortly surac what the
Canadian Paclflo Is already doing In Mani
toba that is double track our road t
enable us to handle the traffic Thus the
te
dIversion of a large portion of the Far
pron
Western wheat trade will advantage every
section of our road it will enable us to
give settlers much lower rates because
gve shall even up our loads sending full
cars both east and west Instead of only
east Whlla wo send cattle grain and
minerals west t Prince Ruport we shall
haul back the coal and the lumber east
which the seWers on that 300000000 acre
farm need
M And now a word please about Prince

EXPORT IX O AtiERlCAX SHOES 1
Free IIIdM Necessary to Make Competi
tion In the Lower tirades Possible
To TIn EDITOR OP THE SUN Sir Hav
ing read the editorial on Free Hides
In Tie Box of December 1 and notcl
statistics a given I also note a failure
to declare why such conditions exist why
the value and quantity of exports In shoes
have increased since ISWJ It Is not be
cause of the ability of our manufacturers
to compete with foreign products and pay
thl duty on hides that this condition exist
ThMvtutv nn hltt hna nnthlncr In tin with
n U
the Increased business done by us In foreign
countries in the shoe line except that It
would be very much larger were hides on
the free list Then we might be able to
compete successfully with German Eng
land Spain Ac
Spn
The reason why our exports In this line
hare Increased Is that they are superior to
the foreign made article in many ways
particularly in style much better finished
more pleasing to the eye and consequently
more salable I Is the better class of our
product that is exported The lower
grades might be exported much greater
volume had we cheaper leather which
would be the case with hides on the free list
This class of bides jthlch I is sought t
place on the free list is available only for
the making of chap coarse leather such as
ii used In low priced goods and It is what
Is needed by our manufacturers to place
them on anything near equality M to price
with England and Germany I is true that
there Is a small rebate on shoes from im
ported bides but the expense and red tape
entailed In collecting I is fully equal to the
reimbursement Were bide on the free
list with our more competent labor and
higher class machinery we should b able
to compete with any country without tak
Inc It out of the American workman
This increase In trade Is not caused by
the ability of manufacturers to do business
with the duty u it now stands but It is be
cause of the efforts made by our people to
place their shoes In foreign lands which
efforts since IBM have been increased from
year to year Representatives now sent
to all the different countries to which shoes
are exported and orders solicited which
was not the case to any extent In I89A The
fact that we have exported as many shoes
as we have against conditions which exist
and under which manufacturers have been
handicapped and at a higher price than the I
same goods made on foreign soil could be
obtained speaks volumes for the Industry i
of this country THEODORE II DROWN
