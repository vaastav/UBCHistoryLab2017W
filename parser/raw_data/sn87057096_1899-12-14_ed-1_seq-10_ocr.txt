Washington £?»-!al: President Mc-'
Kinley's messu«i to the LVIth con
gress was one of the lengthiest ever
"'Submitted to the senate and house of
^representatives of the United States.
Ij^The death of Vice-President Hobart,
'"who passed from this life on the morn
,^lng of Nov. 21 last, Is mentioned as
1
\u&
an event congress is called to mourn at
the threshold of Its deliberations. The
I1* president pronounces a high enconlum
^"'upon a private life which was pure and
f"-^•IfYated and a public career distin
jjSs. '^guished i»y large capacity, stainless in
tegrity and exalted motives.
In beginning his review of national
11^,and international reflations and ques
V" .tions the president calls attention to
the present conditions of unusual pros
•, pcrity, of universal good will among
,y the people at home and the relations
''1$ of peace and friendship that exist with
every government of the world. As an
element of this unusual prosperity our
foreign commerce, it is stated, has
shown great Increase in volume and
value, the combined imports and ex
ports for the twelvemonth baing the
greatest ever recorded In a single year

of our history. It is mentioned as a
-noteworthy fact that the only years in"
all our history when the products our
•.•'manufactories sold abroad exceeded
those bought abroad were 1898 and
1899.
Government receipts from all sources
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1899,
•y aggregated $610,982,004.35 expendi
tures were $-700,093,564.02, leaving a de
ceit of $89,111,559.67. The estimated
receipts for the current year aggregat
f'.i" ed $40,958,112 estimated expendi
tures, $600,958,112, leaving a surplus of
$40,000,000.
The strength of the treasury is grati
gfying. On Dec. 1, 1899, the available
|icish balance was $278,004,SS7.72, of
•'which $239,744,905.36 was in gold coin
and bullion. Customs receipts are now
|Salmost entirely paid in gold. Owing
s|to this favorable condition of the
.treasury with respect to the cash on
:hand
compliance with the provisions
ot the sinking fund, disregarded for
"-^eight years on account of deficiencies
cent loan of 1904, thus making a net
paving of about $2,885,000 in interest.
The government will continue to pur
chase bonds to the extent of $25,000,000
In all provided these are offered and
purchased up to and including Dec. 23.
Increased activity in industry and
agriculture and consequent larger em
ployment of labor at higher wages
adds to the capacity of the people to
absorb the circulating medium. These
changed and changing conditions have
Impaired the national banking act as
to making the needful addition to the
circulation. The attention of congress
Is therefore invited to this subject with
a view to making this act more re
sponsive to the people's needs. The
president again urges, therefore, that
national banks be authorized to organ
ize with a capital of $25,000. He alsu
^recommends that the secretary of the
^treasury be given additional power
and charged with the duty to sell
'United States bonds and to employ
6uch other effective means as may be
-necessary to maintain the parity in
value of the two metals, gold and sil
ver, and the equal power of every dol
lar at all times in the market and in
.^he payment of debts. Gold now seek3
the treasury, but adequate provision
should be made to insure the continu
ance of the gold standard and of pub
"lic confidence in the ability of the gov
ernment to meet all its obligations in
the. money which the civilized world
recognizes as the best. In this con
nection the president repeats his form
er recommendation that a portion of
the gold holdings shall be placed in
a trust fund from which greenbacks
shall be redeemed upon presentation
but when once redeemed shall not
thereafter be paid out except in gold.
Relating to American merchant ma
rine it is recommended that legisla
tion should be enacted which will give
to the country maritime strength com
mensurate with its industrial achieve
ments and Its rank among the nations
•of the earth. Only in this way can we
secure our share in the valuable car
rying trade of the world. The present
Situation in this respect, the president,
jgays, 4s regarded with humiliation at
pJ^|home and with surprise abroad.
t-
On the subject of trusts the presi
dent declares they are justly provoking
^public discussion and should claim
'Jthe attention of congress. The indus
atrial commission, created by act of
congresH June 18, 1898, has not yet
^^completed its Investigations of this
'^jmMect. Whatever power congress
^~J|has in the way of controlling or check
/ajfnj these monopolies should be
"{{promptly ascertained and asserted. At-
*ieauon is canea to tne recommenda
tions of President Harrison in his an
j'nual message of Dec. 3, 1889, and to
that of President Cleveland in bis an
nual message of Dec. 7, 1896, as well
'as to the act of July, 1890, bearing
^upon this subject. It is noted that the
state legislation to which President

department purchasing dur-
lng November $18,408,500 of the 5 per
Cleveland looked for relief from the
evil of trusts has failed fully to necom
pllsh that object, owing principally to
the fact that different states take dif-
,.ferent views as to the proper way to
^discriminate between evil and injuri
7 ,^ous combinations and those associa
tiony which are beneficial and neces
^'~«Bary to the business prosperity of the
^country. The president adds that uni
'^yjformity in state legislation on this
subject is much to be desired and ex
presses the hope that means may be
,'^found for congress within the limita
.A tions of constitutional power so to
^supplement an effective code of state
'Ti.jlegislation as to make a complete sys
tem of laws and compel a general ob
servance of the salutary rales to which

lie and Chile, in which' the United
States minister at Buenos Ay res served
as umpire. A convention of extradi
tion between Argentina and the United
States awaits some slight changes in
the text before exchange.
Reference is made to the claim ot
the Austro-Hungarlan government for
the killing of certain Austrian and
Hungarian subjects at Lattimer, Pa.,
Sept. 10, 1S97. As the sheriff and his
deputies tried for their murder were
acquitted by the courts this govern
ment, after due consideration, declined
to indemnify the sufferers.
Note is made of various minor diffi
culties and insurrections in certain
South American and Central American
republics and the changes resulting.
The Bluefields controversy is still un
settled.
The events of the past year looking
to an isthmian canal are recapitulated
and reasons for early action in the
matter are urged.
Kvents in China as far as concerns
American interests are recounted and
the extension of the area opened to
foreign settlement Is referred to. The
significant statement is made on this
subject that our commercial rights in
China under existing treaties have
been everywhere maintained during
the past year, as they will be in the
future. A commission to study the
commercial and industrial conditions
in the Chinese empire is recommended.
No time should be lost in studying for
ourselves the resources of this great
field for American trade and enter
prise.
The Paris exposition and the prepar
ations of this country to take part in
it are related at length, and the Im
portance of a representative display is
urged. The United States government
building, now approaching completion,
will be worthy in beauty of architec
tural plan and in completeness of dis
play to represent this nation. There
will be over 7,000 exhibitors for every
state of our country, not including ex
hibits from Cuba, Porto Rico and Ha
waii, for which arrangements hava
been made.
Our relations with Germany con
tinue to be most cordial and the state
ment is made that in all the promises
closer relations of intercourse and
commerce and a better understanding
between two races having so many
traits in common, Germany can be as
sured of the most cordial co-operation
of this government and people. Vari
ous matters pertaining to certain re
strictions of trade between the two
countries and also the satisfactory set
tlement of most of them and a recom
mendation for a joint commission of
experts and practkal men of affairs
for the investigation of production and
exportation in both countries is urged.
As to affairs with Great Britain the
work of the joint high commission is
recapitulated and the arrival at a har
monious modus vivendi in the Alaskan
boundary dispute gives hope of a per
manent satisfactory settlement. In
other matters the rotations between
the United States and Canada and
Great Britain remain most friendly.
In tho unfortunate contest between
the Boer states of Africa and Great
Britain this government has maintain
ed an attitude of neutrality. In the
exercise of customary good unices of
a neutral for the care of British .inter
ests opportunity has been afforded to
shov the impartiality of this govern
ment toward both combatants.
As to the deplorable events at Tallu
lah. La., when five Italians were taken
from jail and hanged, the president
states that a satisfactory solution of
the dispute between the two govern
ments in regard to the matter will
doubtless be reached. The recurrence
of such events leads the president to
recommend the conferring upon the
federal courts jurisdiction in this class
of cases.
Mention Is made in speaking of our
relations with Japan of the treaty of
commerce and navigation between the
United States and Japan on Nov. 22,
1894, which became operative in July
last, it is also stated that Japan is
taking a lively interest in the propo
sition of the Pacific cable company to
add to its projected cable lines to Ha
waii, Guam and the Philippines a
branch connection with the coast of
Japan, whereby the latter would be
brought into direct communication
with this country. Without repeating
his previous recommendations on this
subject the president respectfully calls
the attention of congress to them and
recommends that the postmaster-gen
eral be authorized to invite competi
tive bids for the establishment of such
cable.
A review of our relations with Mex
ico shows a gratifying record of mu
tual good will, one of the latest in
stances being the acceptance of Presi
dent Diaz of an invitation to visit Chi
cago last October, but the Illness of a
member of his family prevented his
attendance.
Claims growing out of the seizure of
American sealing vessels In Bering sea
by Russia have been under discussion
for several years with the recent happy
result of an agreement to submit them
to the decision of a single arbitrator.
The important events leading to the
dissolution of the tripartite agreement
as regards the Samoan islands are
recounted and also the satisfactory
partition of the islands between Ger
many and the United States, Great
Britain being given by Germany an
equivalent elsewhere. A convention
has been made by the three powers to
which the attention of the senate will
be invited.
Concerning events and conditions
gTowing out of the recent war with
Spain the message treats very fully.
As to Cuba, held by us In trust for the
Inhabitants with the intent of realiz
ing uie high purpc proclaimed in the
joint resolution adopted by the con
gress- on the 19th of April, 1898, the
president states that the pledge con
tained in this resolution Is of the high
lit a$dmustO^
adopted heretofore in Cuba by this
government have aimed to fit it for a
regenerated existence and for self-gov
ernment within its own sphere. Free
Cuba, however, must be a reality, not
a name. A loosely-framed common
wealth is not to be tnrned adrift to
face the vicissitudes of weaker states,,
but wise preparation must be made
for eventual self-government of re
sponsible character.
In the Turkish empire the situation
of our citizens remains unsatisfactory
and claims of many years' standing
have not yet been collected, though
our government is hopeful in this re
gard.
Attention is called to the arrange
ments made for collecting official and
economic data under the international
union of American republics and also
to the commercial museum of Phila
delphia in furthocance of this idea and
the Pan-American exposition of 1901
on the Niagara frontier.
The president gives a resume of the
Hague conference and its results in
the amelioration of the laws and cus
toms of war and says that the historlo
position of the United States as to en
tanglements with foreign nations was
duly observed.
In regard to the army, especially in
the Philippines, the message gives fig
ures and facts showing the actua'j
number returned, t^c. Mr. McKinley
recommends a special medal of hono?
for volunteers, regulars, sailors and
marines on duty in the Philippines
who remained in tervice after their
terms of enlistment expired. The total
number of troops now in the Philip
pines and those on the way comprise
2,051 officers and 63.4S3 men. The de
velopment of the postal system in
Porto Rico and the Philippines is stat
ed to have been rapid and successful
and to be growing with extraordinary
popularity in the domestic service or
in the United States proper. As to the
navy high praise is given It for its
efficiency and recommendations are
made for necessary legislation and aid
in the matter of naval construction as
suggested by the secretary of the navy.
The statements of the message as to
the future of the Philippines are clear
and unequivocal. The rebellion must
be put down and civil government re
stored. Free public schools must be
established and the burden of gov
ernment equally distributed. Already
hundreds of schools are open and
filled with children. Religious free
dom is sacredly assured and enjoyed.
The courts are dispensing justice and
business is beginning to circulate In
its accustomed channels. The future
government of the islands rests with
the congress of the United States, and
the president adds that a few graver
responsibilties have ever been confided
to us. If we accept them in a spirit
worthy our race and traditions a great
opportunity comes with them. Tho
Islands lie under our flag. They are
ours by every title of law and equity.
They cannot be abandoned. If we de
sert'them we leave them at once to
anarchy and finally to barbarism. No
specific or final form of government
for the Islands Is recommended. When
peace is restored it will be the duty
of congress to construct a plan of gov-"
ernment which shall establish free
dom and order in the Philippines. Un
til congress makes known the final ex
pression of its will the president must
use the authority vested in him to up
hold the sovereignty of the United
States in the islands. When the in
surrection ends it will be the hour of
peace and clemency.
The text of the message, referring to
the Philippines, is in full:
On Dec. 10. 1898, the treaty of peace be
tween the United States and Spain was
signed. It provided, among other things,
that Spain should cede to the United
States the archipelago known as the Phil
ippine Islands, that the United States
should pay to Spain the sum of $20,
OOC.OOO, and that the civil rights and
political status of the native inhabitants
of the territories thus ceded to the
United States should be determined by
the congress. The treaty was ratified by
the senate on the 6th of February, 1S93,
and by the government of Spain on
March 19 following. The ratifications
were exchanged on April 11, and the.
treaty publicly proclaimed. On March 2
the congress voted the sum contemplated
by the treaty and the amount was paid
over to the Spanish eovernment on May
1st.
In this manner the Philippines came to
the United States. The Islands were ced
ed by the government of Spain, which
had been in undisputed possesion of them
for centuries. They were accepted not
merely by our authorized commissioners
In Paris, under the direction of the ex
ecutive, but by the constitutional and
well-considered action of the representa
tives of the peocie of the United States
In both houses of congress. I had every
reason to believe, and I still believe, that
this transfer of sovereignty was in ac
cordance with the wishes and the aspir
ations of the great mass of tho Filipino
people.
From the earliest moment no oppor
tunity was lost of assuring the people
of the Islands of our ardent desire for
their welfare and of the intention of thl*
government to do everything possible to
advance their Interests. In my order of
the 19th of May, 1898, the commander
of the military expedition dispatched to
the Philippines was Instructed to declare
that we came not to make war upon the
people of that, country, "nor upon any
Psrty or faction among them, but to pro
tect them in their homes, In their em
ployments and in their personal and re
ligious rights." That there should be
no doubt as to the paramount authority
there, on the 17th of August It was di
rected that "there must be no Joint oc
cupation with the insurgents that the
United States must preserve the peace
and protect persons and property within
the territory occupied by their military
and naval forces that the Insurgents
and all others must recognize the mili
tary occupation and authority of the
United States. As early as December 4,
before the cession, and In anticipation
of that event, the commander In Manila
was urged to restore peace and tranquil
lity and to undertake the establishment
of a beneficent government, which should
afford the fullest security for life and
property.
On the 21st of December, after the
treaty was signed, the commander of the
forces of occupation was instructed "to
announce and proclaim In the most pub
lic manner that We come not as invad
ers and conquerors but as friends to pro
tect the natives In their homes. In their
employments and In the personal and re
ligious rights." On the same day. while
ordering Gen. Otis to see that the peace
should be preserved In Iloilo, he w,as ad
monished that: "It Is most important
that there shouia be no" conflict witji the
Insurgents." On the first day of Jan
uary, 1899. urgent orders were reitera*ed
that the kindly intentions of this govern
ment should be In every possible way
communicated to the Insurgents.
On the 21st of January I announced my
intention of dispatching to Manila a
commission composed of three gentlemen
highest nbftrMtur nnH
THE LEON REPOKTKR, THURSDAY. DECEMBER 14, -*899.
who, In association with Admiral Dewey
and Major-General Otis, were instructed
to "facilitate the most humane and ef
fective extension of authority throughout
the Islands and to secure with the least
possible delay the benefits of a wise and
generous protection of life and property
to the Inhabitants."
These gentlemen were Dr. Jacob Gould
Schurman, president of Cornell univer
sity the Hon. Charles Denby, for many
years minister to China, and Prof. Dean
C. Worcester of the University of Mich
igan, who had made a most careful study
of life in the Philippines. But before
their arrival at Manila the sinister Am
bition of a few leaders of the Filipino*
had created a situation full of embar
rassments for us and most grievous In
Its consequences to themselves. The
clear and impartial preliminary report of
the commissioners gives so lucid and
comprehensive a history of the present
Insurrectionary movement that the story
need not be here repeated. It Is enough
to say that the claim of the rebel" leader
that he was promised Independence by
any officer of the United States in return
for his assistance has no foundation In
fact and is categorically denied by the
very witnesses who were called to prove
It." The most the Insurgent leader hop
ed for when he oame back to Manila
was the liberation of the islands from the
Spanish control, which they had been
laboring for years without success tc
throw oft.
The prompt accomplishment of this
work by the American army and navy
gave him other ideas and ambitions and
Insidious suggestions from various quar
ters perverted the purposes and inten
tions with -which he had taken up arms.
No sooner had our army captured Manlia
than the Filipino forces began to as
sume an attitude of suspicion and hos
tility. which the utmost efforts of our
officers and troops were unable to dUarm
or modify. Their kindness and forbear
ance were taken as a proof of coward
ice. The aggressions ot the Filipinos
continually Increased until finally, just
before the time set by the senate of the
United States for a vote upon the treaty,
an attack, evidently prepared In ad
vance. was m".1e nil nlonir the A"i"r|oin
nnes, wnicn resulted In a terribly de
structive and sanguinary repulse of the
insurgents.
Ten days later an order of the Insur
gent government was Issued to Its ad
herents who had remained In Manila, of
which Gen. Otis Justly observes that "for
barbarous Intent it Is unequaled In mod
ern times." It directs that at S o'clock
on the night of the 15th of February the
territorial militia shall come together in
the streets of San Pedro, armed with
their bolos, with guns and ammunition
where convenient that Filipino families
only shall be respected but that all
other individuals, of whatever race they
may be, shall be exterminated without
any compassion, after the extermination
of the army of occupation, and adds:
"Brothers, we must avenge ourselves
on the Americans and exterminate them,
that me may take out revenge for the
infamies and treacheries which they have
committed upon us. Have no compas
sion upon them attack with vigor."
A copy of this fell by good fortune into
the hands of our officers and they were
able to take measures to control the ris
ing, which was actually attempted on the
night of Feb. 22, a week later than was
originally contemplated. Considerable
numbers of armed insurgents entered the
city by waterways and swamps and In
concert with confederates inside attempt
ed to destroy Manila by fire. They wert
kept in cneck during the night and the
next day driven out of the city with
heavy loss.
This was the unhappy condition of af
fairs which confronted our commission
ers on their arrival in Manila. They had
come with the hope and Intention of co
cvierating with Admiral Dewey and
Major-Gen. Otis in establishing peace
and order In the archipelago and the
largest measure of self-government com
patible with the true welfare of the peo
ple. What they actually found can best
be set forth In their own words:
"Deplorable as war 1s, the one in which
we are now engaged was unavoidable by
us. We were attacked by a bold, adven
turous and enthuiastic army. No alterna
tive was left to us, except ignominous
retreat.
"It is not to be conceived of- that any
American would have sanctioned the sur
render of Manila to the insurgents. Our
obligations to other nations and to the
friendly Filipinos and to our selves and
our flag demanded that force should be
met by force. Whatever the future of
the Philippines may be, there is no
course open to us now except the prose
cution of the war until the insurgents
are reduced to submission. The commis
sion is of the opinion that there has been
no time since the destruction of the Span
ish squadron by Admiral Dewey when
It was possible to withdraw our forces
from tho islands, either with honor to
ourselves or with safely to the Inhabit
ants."
The course thus clearly indicated has
been untlinchlngiy pursued. The rebel
lion must be put down. Civil govern
ment cannot be thoroughly established
until order is restored. With a devotion
and gallantry worthy of its most bril
liant history, the army, ably and loyally
assisted by the navy, has carried on this
unwelcome, but most righteous cam
paign with richly deserved success. The
noble self-sacrltice with which our sol
diers and sailors whose terms of Bervice
had expired refused to avail themselves
of their right to return home as long as
they were needed at the front forms one
of the brightest pages In our annals. Al
though their operations have been some
what Interrupted and checked by a rainy
season of unusual violence and duration,
they have gained ground steadily In
every direction and now look forward
confidently to a speedy completion ot
their task.
As to Porto Rico the message states
the time is ripe for the adoption of a
temporary form of government for the
island. Many of the suggestions made
with reference to Alaska, it la stated,
are applicable also to Porto Rico.
Changes in the latter, however, should
not be made abruptly and racial pe
culiarities must be giyen due weight.
The message closes with some perti
nent suggestions as to lynchlngs in the
south, the proposed memorial bridge
over the Potomac and a statement of
the purposes of the executive order re
lating to civil service of May 6, 1896,
and a reference to the coming 14th of
December, the 100th anniversary of the
death of Washington, and the patriotic
reflections naturally arising therefrom
and concludes with these words:
"Never has this nation had more
abundant cause than during the past
year for thankfulness to God for mani
fold blessings and mercies, for which
we make reverent acknowledgment"

Methuen Reports Progress.
London, Dec. 12.—A crushing dis
aster" to Gen. Gatacre's command in
Cape Colony is reported from Cape
Town. In an attempt to surprise the
Boers' column at Stormberg on Satur
day morning the British force itself
fell Into a trap and suffered a severe
reverse, being compelled to retire to
Molteno, with a loss of G32 men in
killed, wounded and missing. The
enormous list of missing is understood
here to mean another big addition to
the number of British prisoners in the
hands of the Boers.
Lord Lansdowne, secretary of state
for war, received the dispatch which
follows announcing Gen. Gatacre's re
verse from Gen. Sir Frederick Fores
tier-Wallter, commander of the British
troops in Cape Colony.
"Cape Town, Dec. 10.—The following
was received from Gen. Gatacre this
morning: 'I deeply regret to inform
you that I have met with a serious re
verse. In an attack this (Saturday)
morning on Stormberg I was misled
by the guides and found impracticable
ground.'
In a later dispatch to the war office
Gen. Forestier-Walker says:
"In reference to my telegram of this
morning the casualties so far as known
at present are:
Second Royal Irish rifles,
(killed,
none wounded, six.
"Suffolk regiment, Capt. Weir and
three lieutenants missing rank and
tile, none killed, 12 wounded and 2U0
missing.
"Berkshire mounted infantry, one
killed.
"Seventy-fourth battery, a lieuten
ant and three men severely wounded, a
major and one man slightly wounded,
and one gunner was killed.
"Northumberland fusileers, Major
Stevens, Capts. Fletcher and Morley
and three lieutenants missing also 306
non-commissioned officers and men
missing.
"The remainder of the casualties will
be wired as soon as known."
The Central News correspondent at
Molteno, Cape Colony, gives the first
press account of the disaster that has
befallen Gen. Gatacre's command. He
says: "Early yesterday morning Gen.
Gatacre took a brigade northward to
surprise the enemy and make a night
attack on their Stormberg column, but
we ourselves were surprised, and had
to retire in the face of a much strong
er force., According to reports brought
to camp by our spies, the Stormberg
Boers did not number more than
2.500, and the enemy's position and
circumstances generally appeared to
favor a surprise.
"The brigade, consisting of the
Shropshire regiment, the Royal Dub
lin regiment, the Second Northumber
land regiment, 800 mounted Infantry,
and two batteries of field artillery, left
Putter's kraal, and, moving smartly
and cautiously, arrived safely at a
point two miles from Stormberg, when
suddenly they were exposed to a ter
rific fire right ahead and on the right
flank simultaneously.
"The Irish, who were in the van, im
mediately sought cover behind a kopje
that was fortunately near on the left.
The artillery, Northumberland regi
ment, and the mounted troops followed
in perfect order. The men were set
tled comfortably in their new posi
tions, when they found they were cov
ered by the enemy's guns, which were
much more powerful than had been
supposed. Meanwhile the Boers were
maintaining a heavy rifle fire, but were
not doing much damage. Still under
fire, the infantry and artillery sought
another position half a mile distant,
the field batteries covering the with
drawal splendidly. The new position
was admirably adapted to holding the
enemy in check, the infantry firing be
hind good cover with precision and ef
fect,while the mounted infantry moved
to the north with the object of get
ting the Boers on the right flank.
"The action was now pretty gen
eral, but was still at long range. Only
a few of the British were hit. Then
there was another quick change in the
situation by the discovery of a strong
commando of mounted Boers moving
from the north, and the Irish and
Northumberland regiments were sent
to engage them. They, however, were
met by a heavy fire from a number of
machine guns in good positions. It was
clear that the enemy numbered at least
3,000,. with the best of the ground
and plenty of guns. It was therefore
decided to retire thirteen miles to Mol
teno.
I "The retirement was carried out in
perfect order, despite the fact that the
Boers followed closely, bringing two of
their forty-pounders to bear. Had
their gunners been worth their salt
they would have inflicted considerable
damage on us. Several shells directed
at the ambulance fell short.
"On arriving at Molteno It was found
that the casualties were slight. The
scheme of surprising the Boers failed,
but we obtained valuable information
at trifling cost."
The Daily Mail's correspondent at
Molteno says that Gen. Gatacre's force
numbered 2,700 men.
Another account cf Gen. Gatacre's re
verse says that his force numbered
slightly over 4,000 men. They went
by train to Molteno, where they ar
rived a't 9 p.m. They afterward made
a night march, and the engagement
commenced at 4:14 a. m. The retreat
began at 7 o'clock.
The English comments on the re
verse are universally of the most
gloomy character. The Morning Post
says:
"After Nicholson's Nek this Is. the
most serious reverse the war. We
do not know its full proportions, but
worse must remain behind. Already
the list of missing is close to 400, and
of the Northumherlands six officers are
reported missing, but there are no de
tjiils. regarding the men, while of! the
mea are miss­
flreetshire
ing, and there are no details In regard
to the officers."
The paper comments on the extraor
dinary proportions of the various
casualties. So far only one officer ia
reported to have been killed, eight
wounded and nine missing, while of
non-commissioned officers and men
two were killed, seventeen wounded,
and 596 are missing, and the Suffolkd
was one of the battalions sent to re
place the men captured at Nicholson's
Nek. It concludes: "Men must bo
sent, cavalry and horse artillery es
pecially, unless in sheer parsimony wo
throw away the men of the empire."
The Times' correspondent at Molteno
cables: "The guides misled us. Our
troops were surprised. After a very
trying night the march of retirement
was effected in excellent order and
without hurry. Our losses were heavy.
One gun was abandoned."
The Times considers the results of
the disaster are more likely to be se
rious politically than from a military
point of view.
The serious feature of the affair is
generally considered to be the proba
bility that it will give impetus to
Dutch disloyalty In Cape Colony, where
hosts of farmers are wavering, wait
ing to see which will prove the win
ning side.
Wonder is expressed as to how the
Boers increased their numbers at
Stormberg, which all along has been
Gen. Gatacre's immediate objective,
without his knowing of it
The Chronicle's critic remarks that
it is curious to see an experienced sol
dier trusting so implicitly to his guides
and that his scouts and advance guard
did not inform him that he was com
ing in close contact with the enemy,
and that the ground in front was im
practicable.
The fact seems clear, that Gen. Gat
acre was led unsuspectingly into an
elaborately prepared trap, and it is al
most wonderful that the disaster was
no worse, when, as a correspondent
says, the force was not molested by the
enemy until It had actually reached
the Impregnable position .occupied by
the Boers, when a hot fire was opened
unexpectedly upon it. Everything
seems to have been unexpected, from
the location of the enemy to his num
bers and guns, while the country it
self was apparently absolutely un
known, though it is the very district
Gen. Gatacre has been preparing to
operate in ever since his arrival.

Colenso. A heavy report was beard
from that direction, followed by a
great cloud of smoke.

THIRTY-TWO DIE IN A MINE.

Carbonado, Wash., Dec. 12.—Thirty
two are dead as the result of a mine
horror that came upon Carbonado Sat
urday. As by a miracle two men were
rescued at 5 o'clock Sunday morning
after suffering an awful night in
tombed in the mine. The list of those
who perished so far identified is as fol

James Conway, the first man to

Caldido Parolinl, an Italian, several
ribs fractured by falling timbers.
It was shortly before 11:45 o'clock
Saturday forenoon when this quiet
coal-mining village was Btunned with
the first report of a terrific subter
ranean explosion In the mine of the
Carbon Hill Coal company, the tunnels
pf which run for miles under the town.
There was a rumbling, smothered
cound for a few moments and then It
ceased abruptly. Then the story
spread that the morning shift in tun
nel No. 7 had been caught in an ex
plosion of firedamp. Between seventy
and eighty men were at work in the
mine at the time.
Amid scenes of awful anguish and
dismay the work of rescue was begun.
By night all the survivors had been
brought to the top and many of the
dead were carried up.
Gov. Rogers will conduct a searching
examination as to the cause of the ex
plosion. The question of insufficient
ventilation of the mine in accordance
with the state law will be thoroughly
-gone into. It has been found impossi
ble to secure an Impartial coroner's
jury in the mining districts, and Coro
ner Hoskel has gone to Tacoma and
will select his jurors there.

Track Tanks for Freight Engine*.
The use of track tanks by which lo
comotives of high speed passenger
trains may take water without Stop-"
ping is almost universal on the larger
Eastern roads, where last expresses are
the rule. The B. & O. R. R. has a
number between Washington and Phil
adelphia and intends to equip the en
tire Main Line in the future. This der
cislon was recently arrived at through
the use of passenger locomotives,
equipped with water scoops, on fast
freight trains. It was found that much
time was saved, danger from stopping,
being reduced to a minimum and cost
of running lessened. The extra stops
for water take much time and the wear
and tear on equipment is no small
matter. If the experiment on this patt
of the road proves successful, "track
tanks will be installed on every divi
sion between Baltimore and Chicago.
As a starter, the 50 new Vauclain com
pound engines recently ordered will b*
fitted with water scoops.
