around his body, was jerked from the
belt and fell to the floor. The weapon
immediately discharged and the ball
entered Davis' body just below the
heart. At this time the train was
leaving Bismarck and the wounded
man was put off when he got here. Dr

cently received the following' letter,
which the Register deems sufficiently
important and pleasing to warrant Its
printing. I he subscribers to the docu

well sometimes to "see oursels as

How to Cure Croup.
Mr. R. Gray, who lives near Amenie,
Duchess county, N. Y., says; "Cham
berlain's Cough Remedy is the best
medicine I have ever used. It Is a fine
children's remedy for croup and never
fails to cure." When given as soon as
the child becomes hoarse, or even af
ter the croupy cough has developed, it
will prevent the attack. This should
be borne in mind and a bottle of the
Cough Remedy kept at hand ready for
Instant use as soon as these symptoms
appear. For sale by Arcadia Valley
