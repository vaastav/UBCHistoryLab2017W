The defense in the Hall murder case

holic condition of his brain having caus
ed his death.

defense Friday morning. They testified to

not throw up his hands and cry out
on passing the meeting. They said they
considered Hall a good officer.
Chief of Police Stahl was called. He
said he had not known Head until the
night he was hurt. He said that at the
police station Head said he was net
badly hurt and joked and laughed
about the trouble. He said he succeed
ed in stopping the blood 15 minutes be
fore the physician arrived.
"Was Head Intoxicated?" asked Ena
minger. "I had never seen the man before but
I thought he was intoxicated." said
Stahl.
"Why did you send him home in the
patrol wagon?"
"Because he would have to had been
cared for in the hospital room."
"Did Hall get on the wagon as you
were going to Head's home with him?"
"Yes, as wa were crossing the bridge
Hall stepped on the wagon. They spoke
to each other and showed no animosi
ty." Stahl said he induced Head to go to
bed and then had some trouble in find
ing a man to take care of Head. "As
I remember Mrs. Head was not anxious
for him to be taken home as she did
not know as she could take care of
him." said Stahl.
"What is Hall's reputation among the
officers as a careful and painstaking
officer?" asked Ensminger.
"Object." said Attorney Nichols.
"Overruled." said Judge Hazen.
"His reputation is good." replied
Stahl.
On cross-examination Attorney Nich
ols said: "DtU you not give Head
whisky at the station as a stimulant?"
"I have that impression?" replied
Stahl.
"Why was it you were so anxious to
get him away from the police station?"
"The way he was bleeding I was
afraid the loss of blood would weaken
him."
"You wanted to get him away and
shirk the responsibility, and get him
In other hands?"
"I wanted to get him off my hands."
"Isn't it a fact that taking him home
T ho Got His Stories Mixed.
In the patrol wagon started the flow of
blood again?"
"That might be."
"Did you think he was getting flghty
or was dazed?"
"No; I heard 'Cash' Curtis say that,
but I didn't think he was."
"Didn't Head impress you as a man
who would not admit an injury?"
"Yes, he was very jovial and im
pressed me that way."
, "He was a man who would not give
up till it was all over?"
"Yes."
"Didn't you know at this time that
Hall was a quick tempered man?"
"I had. heard that among the boys."
"Did you go and notify Mrs. Hail
about this trouble?"
"I wouldn't be sure."
"Didn't you and Dr. Hogeboom go to
Mrs. Hall's house?"
"I don't recall it."
"Didn't you hear Mrs. Hall say that
she was afraid of serious trouble?"
"I object," said Ensminger.
"Objection sustained," said Judge
Hazen.
"Did you know of Hall shooting a
man in the back?"
"1 never heard of it till yesterday."
"Was Hall removed from the force
after this trouble?"
"No, he was moved to this side of the
river and wore citizens' clothes and he
was given the discretion of the city."
"Did he not get in trouble after this?"
" Ves."
"Was he discharged for that?"
"No. he. was discharged for another
matter."
"Was he not arrested, and did he not
plead guilty to it?"
"Object," said Ensminger.
"Objection sustained," said Judge
Hazen.
"Didn't Head look like a strong
man?"
"Yes."
HEAD LAUGHED AND JOKED.
Ex-Policeman Henry Carpenter was
the next witness called. He said that
at the police station Head laughed and
joked as his wound was dressed and
said: "I am old enough to know better."
He said Head had been drinking and
was under the influence of liauor. He
had seen Head intoxicated before and
that it was a common occurrence for
him to see Head intoxicated. He said
he went home with Head in the patrol
wagon and that when they met Hall on
the bridge Head asked that the wagon
be stopped and that Hall be allowed to
get in. He said he had known Hall
three years and that up to the time of
this trouble Hall was known as a pains
taking officer.
"Did you consider Hall a cool officer?"
asked Ensminger.
"I never saw him excited," said Car-
pen ter.
"Was he quick tempered?"
"I never saw him lose his temper."
Sergeant McElroy and Officer Bernard
testified that they thought Hall a good
officer.
HENRY STEELE TESTIFIES.
Jailer H. S. Smith was called by the
defense after a. short recess which endJ
ed at 10:50 o'clock. Before the recess
was taken Attorney Ensminger had
called Hall to take the stand in his own
behalf, but at the close of the recess
Smith was called instead. He testified
that at the station Head joked and said
he was not injured seriously. He said
Head had been drinking. On cross
examination he said that Head was
booked for being drunk and disturbing
a religious meeting.
Henry Steele, at one time chief of
police, was called to the stand. He had
known Hall ten or twelve years. He
thought Hall a careful and cool-headed
officer. On cross-examination he said
he had heard people say Hail was quick
tempered.
Chief Stahl was recalled to the stand
and the question was asked by Attor
ney Ensminger if Hall was not espe
cially recommended to him when he
took the position of chief, by his pre
decessors. The question was objected
to and ruled out. The question was
asked if at the autopsy Stahl did not
hear tae physicians say that the frac
ture of the skull could not have caused
death and they would have to look for
other causes for the death.
"Did you see the hammer and chisel
used on the skull to open it?" asked
Attorney Ensminger.
"Yes," replied Stahl.
"What effect did they have upon the
skull?"
"I saw them perceptibly open, and
close the fracture."
HALL ON THE STAND.
At the conclusion of Chief Stahl's tes
timony the defendant, S. M. Hail, was
placed on the stand. He said he had
lived in Topeka fourteen years, and had
worked at lumber yards. He joined the
police force three years ago last July.
He was appointed a policeman by
Mayor C. A. Fellows under Chief of
Police Strauss, and served under Chief
Ramsey and Chief Stahl in turn until
July 28, 1901. In answer to a question
by Attorney Ensminger he said he first
saw Head on the night of the trouble
standing in front of the Adams house.
"What was Geo. Head's condition
that night?"
"He was intoxicated."
"What happened between you and
Head?"
"One of the mission people told Head
to be still. I had not seen Head until
then. He had his hands clasped to
gether and was swaying his body. I
went to Head and put my hand on his
shoulder and said 'You must keep still.'
I walked to the bridge and back on the
other side of tne street. When I got
back and looked across the street I
saw that he was still disturbing the
meeting. I went to him again, and told
him he was in no condition to be on
the street, and told him to go hime. I
went back nearly to the building and
then after went to him and took him
by the sleeve and led him out of the
crowd. He had his hands in front of
him. and turned around and struck me
on the shoulder. I had my club grasped
about nine inches from the end. 1
tapped him lightly with my club. The
blow did not stagger him. He again tried
to strike me and took hold of a lamp
post, and I had to take him away from
it. I led him to the depot and sat him
down in a chair."
"There was no enmity betwen you
and Head?"
"No."
"You had no trouble with him be
fore?" "No. Except that at the election I
had to lead him out of the lines."
"There was no revenge between you?"
"No."
"Did you mean to hurt him?"
"No."
"Did rou mean to kill him?"
'I had no more idea of killing him
than I have of killing the court today."
"Do you regret the fact that this oc
curred?" "No one regrets It more than I."
'Do you regret it alone because you
are in trouble?"
"No, because he is dead."
Hall's eyes were filled with tears and
he spoke low and distinct -His wife and
daughters who sat behind his attorney
were overcome by emotion and wept as
Hall was testifying.
"How long had you known Head?"
"About 5 years."
"Had you seen Head before when he
had been drinking?"
"Yes."
"How did he seem?
"He talked more and made more
fun."
"Where did you take Head when you
arrested him?"
"I took him to the depot."
"Did he say to Mrs. Head there that
you beat him?"
"He said something to that effect."
"Did you assist in stopping the flow
of blood?"
"I gave Mrs. Head a handkerchief."
'When did you see Head next?"
"He was In the wagon on his way
home."

Ct noierce Commission.
BIG RAILWAY MERGER.

. ance ir. Some (Quarters.
National Commission Agrees to
Help All It Can.
St. Paul, Dec. 6. The members of the
Minnesota state railroad and warehouse
commission, the Pioneer Press says,
will go to Washington to confer with
the interstate commerce commmission
ers on a method of procedure in sec
onding Governor Van Sant's fight
against the prdposed railway merger
as contemplated by the Northern Se
curities company.
The commission has invited Governor
Van Sant and Attorney General Doug
las to accompany it and it is expected
that both will accept, as transportation
has been arranged for five persons. The
party will leave St. Paul Saturday
night and the conference with the in
terstate commerce commission is set
for Tuesday. The conference was plan
ned by Commmissioner Mills and has
been under consideration for some time
but the final arrangements were not
completed until last night. Mr. Mills
declines to discuss the matter. He is
the author of the resolution providing
for the conference. In a general way
the purpose of the conference is to ar
rive at a definite plan of action and if
possible secure the co-operation of the
national commission. The interstate,
commerce commission has signified its
willingness to extend any help it may
be able to under the interstate com
merce laws.

Fourth For failure to destroy the

Fifth For conduct unbecoming an offi

ments in regard to the findings of the
Schley court.

"Yes, I got in."
"Did Head laugh and joke?"
"Yes, he did and said he would be all
right in the morning."
HALL CROSS-EXAMINED.
On cross-examination Attorney
Nichols said:
"How long had you served as a po
liceman in North Topeka?"
"I had been on the force three years
and in North Topeka most of the time."
Hall said he thought Head was a
man who would laugh and at the same
time knock a person down. He said he
never knew of Head carrying weapons
of any kind. He said it was about 5
minutes between the second and third
time that he went to Head. When Jie
did go he stood behind Head for a
short time and then took hold of Head
and led him out of the crowd. "When
we got out of the thickest part of the
crowd he swung himself around and
struck me on the arm with the hand of
the arm I had hold of. He then tried
to strike me with the other hand and
threw his two fists up in front of him
and I struck him with my club. As he
turned round he said, 'hold on." "
"Were you afraid of him?" asked
Nichols.
"Yes, I was afraid of him," replied
Hall.
"Was that a regular policeman's club
furnished by the administration?"
"Yes."
"Where did you have hold of the
club?"
"About at the middle."
"Did you think he "had it in foryou'?"
"No."
"Did you ever see him around with
a club?"
- "Yes, once."
"What did he do after you struck
him ?"
"He went to the lamp post and clung
to it."
"Then you went to the depot?"
"Yes."
"Did you hear him say to his wife,
Honest to God, Mattie, I didn't do a
thing; this man just beat me?"
"He said something like that."
"Didn't you tell the crowd to stand
back, that they "must never have seen
a man hit'?"
"I can't remember exactly what I
said."
"Haven't you been in trouble since
this for clubbing a man?"
"I object." said Attorney Ensminger.
"The objection is sustained," said
Judge Hazen.
"I would like to answer that," said
Hall.
"You can if your attorney removes his
objection," said Judge Hazen.
"I insist on my objection," said
Ensminger.
"Didn't you and some other police
men go to this Mission hall late that
night to see what the people knew
about this occurrence?"
"Yes."
"Is that a usual procedure?" ,
"Yes."
On redirect examination Attorney
Ensminger asked if he had ever seen
Head armed.
"Yes," reolied Hall.
"What with?"
"A knife."
"Who did he intend to use It on?"

Operate in the Philippines.
London, Dec. 6. The editor of the
Financier reasserted this morning the
correctness of the report regarding the
organization of a combination of the
tobacco growers in the Philippine isl
ands, printed December 4 in the Finan
cier, adding that he was sure the pro

RUNAWAY TRAIN.
Comes to a Standstill in Station
Waiting Room.
Frankfort, Dec. 6. A large part of
the handsome railway station here was
wrecked this morning by the Orient ex
press, the airorakes of which failed to
work. The train dashed into the sta
tion at full speed, jumped the platform
and came to standstill in the middle
waiting room, against the debris of a
stone wall. A few of the passengers
were badly bruised, but no one was
fatally injured. The people about the
station and in the waiting room had
remarkable escapes.
PARALLEL THE CHOCTAW.
Rock Island to Build a lane to South,
McAllister. '
Guthrie. Okla,, Dec. 6. A party of
Rock Island surveyors started from El
Reno yesterday to run a line parallel
to the Choctaw to Oklahoma City and
South McAlester. The Rock Island has
determined to build this line unless it
can purchase the Choctaw, which it is
stated upon authority is not for sale.
It has been known for some time
that the Rock Island would eventually
build into this city, though it was sup
posed that the road would come from
the northwest rather than from the
west. But there is a rivalry between
the Choctaw and the Rock Island, and
this rivalry has lately been stimulated
by the Choctaw building north from
Geary into the Rock Island's territory.
It is also stated that the Rock Island
has endeavored to secure control of the
Choctaw, and that its inability to buy
that road had much to do with its de
termination to parallel it. It is said
that the parallel line will not stop at
Oklahoma City, but will be extended on
to South McAlester.
There has existed a sort of an agree
ment between the different railroad
companies that have already built into
the Territory that they will not Invade
the territory of the other. This agree
ment is being strictly kept by the
Santa Fe and Rock Island. When the
Santa Fe wanted a line over to King
fisher from Guthrie, in order not to
violate the agreement each company
built half way. and they operate the
road jointly. The building of the new
line into this city from El Reno will not
affect the traffic of the Santa Fe, but
it will materially affect that of the
Choctaw.

FOR THE TREATY.
Senate Committee of Foreign
Relations Totes Solidly
For Farorable Report on Hay
Pauncefote Treaty.
ARE SOME OBJECTIONS.
Rut Not Enough to Cause a Dis
senting Vote.
Chester I. Long on Honse Ways
and Means Committee.
Washington, Dec. 6. The senate com
mittee on foreign relations today voted
to report favorably the new Hay
Pauncefote treaty providing for- the
construction of an isthmian canal.
The committee was in session nearly
two hours; and went over in detail the
provisions of the convention. No votes
were cast against it, but it was criti
cised very sharply by Senators Money
and Bacon, who found in it many of
the objections which they urged against
the old treaty. They took especial ex
ception to the provision continuing in
force the neutrality provision of the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty, and also mad?
objection to the clause specifically au
thorizing the United States to police the
canal as placing a limitation upon the
power of this country to absolutely con
trol it. The contention was made that
the effect of the treaty as sent to the
senate would be to deprive the United
States of control of the canal in case
of war. Especial attention was called
to the provisions in the preamble of the
pending treaty reserving article 8 of
the Clayton-Bulwer treaty from the re
peal provision of the new treaty. The
portion of this article of the old treaty
to which especial objection was made
reads as follows:
"In granting, however, their just pro
tection to any such canals or railways
as are by this article specified it is al
ways understood by the United States
and Great Britain that the parties con
structing or owning the same shall im
pose no other charges or conditions of
traffic thereupon than the aforesaid
governments shall approve of as just
and equitable; and that the same canals
or railways being open to the citizens
and subjects of the United States and
Great Britain on equal terms, shall also
be open on like terms to the citizens and
subjects of every other state which is
willing to grant thereto such protection
as the United States and Great Britain
engage to afford."
Senators Money and Bacon did not go
to the extent of voting against the re
port of the treaty, and they acknowl
edge they are anxious to see it ratified
because of their great desire to have the
canal built. Still they insisted that the
treaty as it now stands is very objec
tionable in case of the contingency of
war.
Senator Frye presided over the meet
ing and he authorized Senator Lodge
to report the treaty to the senate on
Monday next in case there should be an
executive session on that day.
It was also the sense of the commit
tee that the consideration of the treaty
should be pressed as speedily as possi
ble in the senate some senators express
ing the hope that action might be se
cured before the adjournment for the
holidays. The committee also voted to
recommend that the injunction of secre
cy be removed from the treaty.
LONG ON WAYS AND MEANS.
Washington, Dec. 6. In the house to
day after the reading and approval of
the journal, Mr. Gaines, (Tenn.) who
has just returned from the Philippines,
appeared at the bar where the oath of
office was administered to him.

the appointment of the following com
mittees: Ways and means Payne, (N. Y.);Dal

FAVORABLE REPORT ON KNOX.
Washington, Dec. 6. The senate com
mittee on the judiciary today authoriz
ed a favorable report on the nomination
of P. C. Knox to be attorney general.
Opposition to the confirmation is made
by the anti-trust league who has filed a
protest with the committee in which
especial complaint is made that Mr.
Knox failed to bring certain suits
against organizations said to be trust.i,
which he was urged by the league to
institute. The committee considered
this document at some length but con
cluded that the president should b-; al
lowed to choose his own advisers, he be
ing responsible for them. The vote for
a favorable report was unanimous.
In each of the committees announced
today the majority representation was
increased one and the minority repre
sentation reduced to that extent. This
policy is to be followed in the appoint
ments of other committees. Mr. Met
calf of California, is the new Republi
can members on the ways and means
committee and Messrs. Brownlow of
Tennessee, Gardner of Michigan and
Burkett of Nebraska, the new Republi
can members on appropriations.
Mr. Underwood of Albania, was the
Democrat dropped from the ways and
means committee. The retirement of
Mr. Allen (Miss.) from congress made it
unnecessary to drop a Democrat from
the appropriation committee. Mr.
Wachter (Md.) succeeds Mr. Baker of
the same state as chairman of the com
mittee on enrolled bills. Mr. Baker was
not reelected.

Grau's " Opera Season at 'Frisco a
Great Success.
San Francisco, Dec. 6. The most re
markable season of grand opera ever
given on this coast terminated last
night at the Grand opera house and the
Grau company is now speeding towards
Kansas City on a special train that left
at 2 o'clock this morning.
During the four weeks' season the
company gave 30 performances and the
receipts have reached the sum of $230.
000. The number of people who heard
the grand opera figures up to more than
80.000. -
The enthusiasm manifested at the
closing performance has never been sur
passed here. The performance of "Tne
Marriage of Figaro" with Sembricn,
Barnes and DeReszke in the cast was
frequently interrupted by applause and
the closing curtain was , raised nine
times, the audience remaining standing
cheering, waving handkerchiefs and
hats, while bouquets were thrown to the
smiling singers on the stage.
Calve leaves this morning for Florida,
Where she will rest until she is able to
join Grau in New York for the season.
Eames will leave for St. Louis this
morning and will rest there for one
week until the company arrives in that
city. Sybil Sanderson has decided to
have an operation performed on her
throat and will probably remain in Cal
ifornia for a few weeks.
BURNED HER TO DEATH

plosion in Texas.

the explosion of a coal oil lamp. Robert
Stafford and son, Walter, were badly
burned about the hands in trying to ex
tinguish the fire.
WHY THE DOERS FIGHT ON.
Cape Colony Rebel Allies Insist on
Prolonging Hostilities.
New York, Dec. 6. A correspondent
of the London Times and New York
Times, wiring from Pietermaritzburg,
Natal, says the Boer generals would
probably have thrown up the sponge
long ago but for the loyalty of the Cape
rebels to the Boer cause.
The bulk of the enemy in Cape Col
ony consists of rebels. For the Boers
to surrender without protecting the
rebels would be regarded as the height
of contemptible meanness by all Afri
kanders and Boer sympathizers, and
would produce such a revulsion of feel
ing on the part of the colonial rebels
against the republicans as would best
safeguard against any future rising of
the Dutch colonists.
The truth is, says the correspondent,
that neither side can accept peace on
any terms the other can grant, and
therefore there is nothing left but to
rely on the effects of attrition.
STRIKE IS OVER.
Switchmen Are All Preparing to Re
turn to Work.
Pittsburg, Dec. 6. Traffic was mov
ing promptly today on the railroads
recently affected by the switchmen's

FAMILY DUKNED.
Two Dead and Seven Injured ia the
Klee Household.
Pittsburg, Dec. 6. Two persons were
burned to death and seven injured in a
fire at Carnegie, Pa., this morning. Th
dead are:
MRS. SARAH KLEE, aged 43.
MARY KLEE, aged .
The injured are:
Samuel Klee, aged 50.
Ida Klee, aged 20.
Anna Klee. aged 17.
Rachael Klee. aged 14.
Eva Klee, aged 10.
Jennie Klee, aged 6.
Harry Klee, aged 4.
The Klee residence is a two-story
frame house on Broadway, the ground
floor front being devoted to a grocery
store kept by Klee, and the rest of the
house being occupied by the family.
The fire was discovered about 4:40
o'clock this morning by the grocery
clerk, Morris Fizis. He immediately,
gave the alarm, but the flames spread
so rapidly that the occupants of the
upper story were shut off from the
stairway, and Klee and his wife realized
that there was but one Way to sava
the children, and that was to throw
them from the window, a distance of
about 20 feet.
One by one the children were brought
to the front window and dropped to)
the ground by the father. All of theni
were more or less seriously injured, but
all escaped death from the flames ex
cept Mary. By the time Harry, the
baby, was reached, not only was the
father exhausted by his exertions and
the terrible conditions under which ho
worked, but the flames were fast mak
ing his efforts impossible. .When he wan
able to get at Harry it was found that
the fire had already reached him, and
that the little one's face, feet and hands
were blistered terribly. He was
snatched from the flames Just in time,
and it is thought he will survive.
After rescuing his baby the father
looked around lor his wife, whom ho
had missed from his Bide for some
time. Unable to locate her, he called
to those whom he had saved for the
purpose of ascertaining if she had
joined them. She had not, and the
husband became almost distracted w iti
fear and panic. It seems, however, that
while the father was rescuing thes
youngest and most helpless child, she
was making an attemp-. to save the lif'o
of Mary, and in doing so gave up her
own life. The bouse was entirely de
stroyed. The charred remains of the mother
and daughter were found in the ruins,
side by side. Both had been overcome
by the smoke before they could escape
from the room. When the firemen ar
rived the father refused to leave th
building without his wife and child, and
the firemen were compelled to forcibly
carry him from the burning building.
