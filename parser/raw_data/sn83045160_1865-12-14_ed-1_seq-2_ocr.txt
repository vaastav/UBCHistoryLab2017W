punishing men 1st actine in conformity
with the di tate of their own con¬
sciences during the late war. we think
still less of him. While Gen. Sheridan
seems to desire to conciliate and to re¬
store fraternal relations between the peo¬
ple of the two wines of the Republic,
tJov. Hamilton exhibits his new-lorn
leal by persecuting those who once
disagreed with him in relation to the
propriety of the war. Gen. Sheridan
triumphed."
This Gov. Hamilton, we believe, ran
away from Texas during the war, and
we do not remember ever to have hear l
of his striking a single blow for the Union
while it lasted. He goes back in the rear
of the army to persecute men, now that
they are powerless and helpless, that he
never dared to confront when' they had
arms in their hands. All honor to Gen.
Sheridan for balking his unmanly ma¬
lignity. The truly brave are ever mag¬
nanimous to the fallen foe. Cowards
only are meanly revengeful.

The Southern Soldiers Relief Assoria-

can the shattered victim of the lost

hearts should warm to them so tenderly t
as we who came out of the tattle

work and after awhile, when we have
RWumuIat'.-d property, it will be forgot¬

no forpetfuiness. lnpenioned and un-

jiif.ir tt. s.- lortunaie ismpanjoif in the
great struggle, they must go halting to
the grave. Let us pension them, and
"honor them with loundles charity and
kindly love.
These gallant men have holy claims
on the fathers, mothers, brothers and
sisters of those to whom the blind bullet
was more kind, and who sleep the noble
soldier's slee on the battle field, who
have escaped the humiliation of having
the wounds and poverty of the woruout
-s.ld.or without cither country or flag.
These brave men have claims upon the
whole world for the lessons of bravery
and devotion which their undaunted
conduct will teach the patriot in all time
to come.
Our people are opening their hands
most liberally to this holy charity, and
in a few weeks the hopes of the excellent
men and women who have taken the
lead, will be gratified by seeing every
helpless Confederate soldier within our
reach, comfortably and haypily housed,
feed and clothed. The Rev. Dr. Knott
is the agent of the society. He is ilevot-

incidentally to the great work of founding
the permanent home, he is gathering lip

are working their tedious ways to their
home. While we pray od to bless, let
us help the wounded Confederate soldier
who has no home and resource.
to do so who nave not loneiieu so mucn
of their rights to citizenship as to require
said ardon? In short, of what use is
the amnesty oath morr than the oath of
allegiance .'
Really, it appeaw that those who held
the most responsible s-itious in the 'on-
fnlerate army have the most piivllecvs
at present. Some may say that the States
have taken away the" rights given us by
the I'nitrd States Government by way of
the amnesty oath. If such is the case.
Sow Is the matter to be remedied? My
idea of the amnesty oath was, that it
granted full pardon for all past offences.
Am I right ?

We may not le able to answer
satisfactorily all our .rrcspondeiit -in¬
quiries, hut the alove will probably
meet mist of them. By the President's
proclamation amnc-ty was extended to
all engaged in the war, except certain
ss-ifiel ela . among which are all
alsove the rank of Colonel, all a hose
estates are worth twenty thousand dol¬
lars, all Who voluntarily left a loyal
State to take part in the war, all who
held office under the Government, and
some others not now remembered, who
w. re reserved as subjects of special par¬
don. 'The persons admitted !- the privi¬
lege of taking the amnesty oath, are re¬
stored to all the privileges of citizenship
in tie- Cnit.-d Sta'.e-. and it would cer¬
tainly seem that the.Statesof which they
were citizens ought to be as liberal,
and magnanimous as the Vnited States,
and restore to them their rightsof citizen-
h:nin the States. But in several of the
States this has not not lieen done. In
Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri, and
we believe also in Arkansas, the so-called
" loyal" Legislatures, made up in great
part of renegade and apostate seceRRon-
lats, fierce fanatics in behalf of the I nioii
who took good care to remain behind the
Vnion armies, and new men in politics.
tlirown U the surface by the' convul¬
sions of the times, have passed the most
sweeping laws of disfranchisement.
They are invincibly opposed to any
reneal. or amelioration of these
laws, as they pretend on ac
count of the heinousness of the
offense committed by thosedisfranchised,
but in reality, as we suppose, from ap¬
prehension, that they would lose then-
places if these old citizens should Is; al¬
lowed to vote. There is no remedy for
this but time, and that "soVer second
thought of the people," which is very
rarely wrong, and is generally efficient
in the correction of evils. Neither the
President, nor the General Government,
can do anything to change these State
Laws, further than their example and
the spirit they exhibit, may exert an in¬
fluence upon the oligarchy that now have
sway in these States. This petty. and
spiteful despotism cannot last always.
The case of the Mississippi General who
was elected Governor, is an exceptional
one, the pardon being in effect asked for

voting for him. Our correspondent, and

LETTER I ROW MISSISSIPPI.
Vit'KSBrao, Miss.. Nov. 27. lsfiv
Eds. Appeal: Since the memoralJe
days of eighteen hundred and sixty-three,
when Gen. Grant with his multitudi¬
nous army environed the-previously in¬
domitable city of the " Walnut Hills, "
but little lias been heard of the Appeal
which in those days had ingratiated itself
so completely into the good graces of the
people here, that no office, desk or pri vate
table was complete without it. It was
then the palladium of news, the encyclo¬
pedia of aruiv operations, the book of
reference f.r all correct accounts of mili¬
tary and civic transactions. With its
corps of efficient correspondents, and its
facilities of obtaining and transmitting
the news of the dav, -it became the most
famous and celebrated piper in the
country.
Although we have been aware of the
fact that its publication had been re¬
vived, it was not until within the hv-t
week that the first number found its in
to this place. Many of its old friends
have long and patiently awaited it- re¬
appearance, with the same anxiety us
they would watch the return of an old
snd esteemed companion. It i- wel¬
comed here with the greatest pleasure,
and regarded as again the beffl niper in
Memphis. The immensity of it- size,
the neatness of its tyjsnrraphical x. ii-
tiou, the sterling ability of its editorial
staff", all commend it to the general
reader as one of the ablest journals in
the Southern country, and its merit-will
no doubt soon place it beyond the reach
of competition.
The Appeal must, of necessity, be a
good medium through which to make
known the superior and unlimited in¬
ducements which the grand old State of
Mississippi offers to capitalists and emi¬
grants ; and, as capital, enterprise, mi¬
grants, lalsir, mdustrv. and a spirit of
general go-aheailiveness is what is

"Mr. Wilson presented the petition of
trance and twenty-live oitier col¬
ored citizens of the District of Columbia,
asking for the right of suffrage. The
petitioners set forth that a large pro¬
portion of the colored citizens of the
District are property holders and tax¬
payers. They claim that they are suf¬
ficiently intelligent to build and sustain
church and institutions of learning and
to accumulate property, they are suffi¬
ciently intelligent to vote. That for
years they have been obliged not only to
educate their own children, but contri¬
bute to the support of the schools in which
only white children ars taught. That
the record of the colored people as to
crime and pauperism is as tar as any
other class in the country. Out of a
population of less than fifteen thousand,
they sent three thousand five hundred
soldiers into the field, while the white
population of over s)ty thousand fur¬
nished only fifteen thousand, and the
colored soldiers volunteered without the
incentives of large bounties, pay or pro¬
motion.
The petition was referred to the Com¬
mittee on the District of Columbia.
The President pro tent., laid before the

Mr. Brown presented a bill to grant

Mr. Wade introduced the following,
which was referred to the committee on
foreign affairs:
Whereas, In a letter of instruction,
dated July third, eighteen hundred and
-ixty-two, directed to the general com¬
manding the French forces in Mexico,
the Kmperor of the French indicated the
policy concerning the affairs of this con¬
tinent, by declaring his intention to es¬
tablish a monarchy in Mexico, which
would restore to the Latin race on this
side of the Atlantic all their strength and
iirestnre: guaranty security to the
Frcii. h West India colonies, and those of
Spain ; secure the interests and estaljish
tue interests ol trance in J.he center of

Retaiveel, That the attempt to

on its shores a monarchy sustained solely
by European layonets; is opposed to the

Ji'vJ.i.i, That the President of the

steps concerning this grave matter as will
indicate the recognized policy and protect
the honor and interests of our Govern¬

On the motion of Mr. Howard the

Mr. Johnson offered a substitute which
he said was similar to Mr. Suniner'sprop-

Wednesday, to refer to that part of the
President's message relating to the state
of the Union.
The report of the Secretary of War is
very elaborate d.icument, reviewing
the entire military operations since the
commencement of the last session of
Congress. The appropriation of that
Congress amounted to $51,2),131 70.
The military estimates for the next
fiscal year are $&l,.s.H,4ol H3, which are
based uion a standing force of 50,)00
men, so organized as to admit of an In¬
crease, without addition:,! organisation,
to 82,1)00 troops of all arms.
The Xatioiial military force numbered
on May 1, 1",, I.OOU.oprmen, of whom
more than soo,ooi) have lieen mustered
out. " What has occasioned this reduc¬
tion of force and expenditure," says the
Secretary, "it is the object of this re-
rt to explain."
He thereujsm proceeds to recapitulate
the position of affairs at the commence¬
ment of the last session of Congress,
enumerating the strength and dispts-ition
of our armies, and those of the rebels,
ami vlescribing, at some lenirtli, those
military operations which liave become

scattered in various quarters, west of the

Military operations' west of the Miss¬
issippi, in Virginia, on the Shenandoah,
in the Atlanta campaign, and elsewhere,
are severally recounted. On the 1st of
March, 1S05, tj02,.j.9S men were repirted
"present for duty," the distribution of
whom docs not vary greatly from that
eiven atiove. The operations before Fort
Fisher, in the Carolinas, on Red river,
before Mobile, and Sheridan's Winches¬
ter campaign, an- alluded to, and Grant's
campaign against Richmond and Peters¬
burg described.

The operations having been brought
down to thesurrender of the rebel armies,
and the close of the rebellion, the report
proceeds to detail the measures that have
lieen adopted for the reduction of the
military establishment It is stated
that
' ' These measures have been carried
into effect from time to time, as the exl-
u'. ncies of the service would admit. It
will be seen from the report of the Adju-
tanM iencral that troops to the iiumW
of .'.no.'.Skt have already lieen mustered,
paid off. and disbanded. Further reduc-
0m i-contemplated. Upon thedisohnrgc
of troops the services of a trreat number
of staff, field and general officers a cre no
longer required. Of these have re¬
signed, and others were honorably mus¬
tered out. Xo doubt in many instances
it has been painful for gallant and ac¬
complished onii-ers to leave that service
to which they have -been accustomed,
and where they have won honorable
d.-Tiiietion. But it i to the credit of the
volunteer service that they nave recog¬
nized the obligation of the Government
to reduce the military establishment
with the occasion that called it into
existence, and that their own wishes or
int. rest have not been imjsirtunely
urged against the necessities of the ser¬
vice.
The disposition of the veteran reserve
cor presented sonic considerations of
a peculiar nature. It was the inclina¬
tion of the deiiurtraent to retain it in
service until the meeting of Congress.
But inquiry showed that a very small
per cent, of enlisted men were content
to remain in service. All who desired
have therefore been discharged, and su¬
pernumerary officers mustered out.
THE NATION'S KEAniNES. FOR WAR.
The Sis rotary assures the people that
none need feel apprehensions elf alarm
because the army is so suddenly reduced
to a icaee footing, even while grave in¬
ternational questions are threatening to
disturb the quiet of the country. His
remarks on tlus point are somewhat sig¬
nificant :
" The troops discharged were chiefly
volunteers, who went to the field to up¬
hold the system of free government es¬
tablished hy their fathers, and which
they meau to bequeath to their children.
Their toils and sufferings, their marches.
battles and victories, have not diminished
the value of that government to them
so that any new rebellion would encoun
ter equal or greater fore font- reduction
and none can ever spring up with such
advantages at the start, or Is- conducted
with superior means, ability, or prospect
of success. A foreign war would intensify
the national feeling, and thousands, once
misled, would rejoice to atone their error
by rallying to the national flag. The
in -t:..n of brm in which armies could be
ra:-d to quell insurrection or repel inva
sjon Is. therefore, the only question rela
ting to troops. Our experience in this
point is significant. When l ew s army
stirrenuered, thousands ot recruits were
pouring in. and men were discharged
rrom recruiting stations and reudez
vous in every State. On sev
erai occasions, wnen troops were
promptly needed to avert impending dis¬
aster, vigorous exertions lirought them
into the held from remote States, with
incredible -1,1. official reports show
that after the disaster on the Teulnsula,
in is... over so .,,, r,,nM were enlisted
organized, armed, equipped and sent into
the field in less than a in. .nth. Sixty
thousand tnwips have repeatedly gone to
the field within fbur weeks. And !Xi,000
infantry wore sent to the armh-s, from
i lie tlve .-states or Ohio, Indiana, Illinoi
Iowa and Wjsconsiti within 9p ilayi
" lien the rebellion comrnenceil, the
nation was a stranger to war. Officers
hail little experience, privates had none
dui me prescm generation ol men in
tin- country are now veteran soldiers.
For the battle, the march or the
s-teire. they are already trained
i Bey are as much at home in the touted
nei.l as in the farm hou-.-, the manufai
tory, or the shop. Xo time is reouired
I to train them ; and the speed of the rail-
roau aim telegraph determines the time
required to raise an army in the I'nited
ciaiet.

time, than had heretofore been known
in war. The Government has disposed
or is disosing of this transportation, but
it remains in tliis country, and can au-
swer any exigency."
He apprehended no difficulty in pro¬
curing subsistence, am concluded that
" however sudden the exigency calling
for an exhibition of military power, it
could be promptly met. With our edu¬
cation, habits and experience, the na¬
tion, w hile in the midst of peace, is pre¬
pared for war."
The present military organization,
with its nineteen departments, is then
dca ribad, with which the public is
already familiar.

XIUTIA SYSTEM.
A well organizisl militia system i re¬
garded as highly important, and it is in¬
timated that practical plan has been
devi-ed, which will be presented for the
consideration of Congress. Provision for
the wants of wounded and di-a. l.-d sol¬
diers will also lie required, though the
Hecrstary gives no opinion whether this
duly can licet be performed by the X'a-
lional Government or the several state
authorities.

Over 1,700 miles of railroad have been
restored to their former owners : houses.
vessels, milts, horses, etc., Iiave lieen dis-

a large amount to the Government.
The manufacture of cannon has been
continued, for the purposeof arming the
permanent fortifications in course of
construction. Xo now muskets, how
ever, are iieing made, there being about
a iniuiou and a half of small arms on

The reiMirt concludes with the Secre¬
tary's opinions of the causes which led
to the overthrow of the rebellion, princi¬
pal among which are the anti-slavery
policy of the government, the evident
purpose of the iieople to maintain the
Union, and ihe re-election of Abraham
Lincoln. He concludes as follows :
"Looking to the causes that have ac¬
complished the national deliverance.
there seems no room henceforth to doubt
the stability of the r ederal L nion. 'l'hese
causes are permanent, and must always
have an active existence. The majesty
of national power has been exhibited in
the courage and faith of our citizens,
and the ignominy uf rebellion is wit¬
nessed by the hopeless eud of the great
reliellion.''
