THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
/ For the greater convenience of our
patrons we ?ondense President Grands
Third Ainual Message, leaving out
much thajt would fail to interest the
general reader but incorporating
everything of value to the mass pf
the public of our section.
The President begins by assuring
Congress that during the past -year
success has generally attended the
effort to execute all la vs found-upen
the statute books. The policy h ts
been not to enquire into the . w is Jo cu
of the laws already enacted,, bot *>
learn their spirit and intent, and to
enforce them accordingly.
How well this selfish ?nd partisan
Chief Executive has failed to en
quire into the wisdom of the atro
cious Ku Klux law, enforcing it bitter
ly for his own purposes, we South
Carolinians can attest , to ,our cost.
Grant is not a fool, j bnt her is un
doubtedly an ungenerous and little
minded man. .
STATE' OF THE COUNTRY.
The past year has, under a wisc
Providenc?, been one of general pros
perity to. the nation. It has, . how
ever! been attended with more than
usual chastisements in loss of life and
. pror^rty.by storm and nre. These
disasters "have served to call forth
the best elemente of human , mature
Jin'our country, and to develop fa j
'.friendship for us ?n the part of for
eign nations, which goes far towards
alleviating the distresses occasioned
by these calamities.
. FOREIGN. RELATIONS.
The relations of the I United States
with foreign powers ?continu?- to be
friendly. The year has been an event
ful one in witnessing two. great na
tions, speaking one language and h iv
arf ?tration ?ispute?'?f fo'n^' studing,
and liable at any time to bring
f ft^j^?m? into) *?CK)d^Mco8tly
conflict. I transnut^Bgmth a copy
of thS-treaty alluded to, which has

adjusting the questions pending7 Be
tween tb? two nations. Various ques
tions are to be:.adjusted by arbitra-^
tion. I recommend Congress at an
early day to make the necessary 'pro
vision for the tribunal at Geneva and
for the several commissioners on the
part of the! United States called for j
by the treaty.
His Majesty, the King of Italy,
the President of* the. Swiss Confede
ration, and His Majesty,, the Emperor
of Brazil, have each consented on the
joint request of the two powers, to
name an arbitrator ?for the tribunal at
Geneva. I have caused my thanks
to be suitably expressed for the read
ine>ss with which the jcint request has
been complied with by the appoint
ment of gentlemen of eminence and
learning to these important positions.
: His Majesty, the Emperor of Ger
many, hiss beer, pleased to comply
with the joint request" of the two
Governments, and has consented to
act as the arbitrator of the disputed
water, boundary between the United
Slates and Great Britain. The cdh
tractingp?rties in the treaty have
undertaken to regard as between
themselves certain principles of pub
lic law for which the United States
have contended from the "commence
ment of their history. They have
also agreed to bring these principles
to the knowledge of other maritime
powers anil to inviie . them tb: accede
to them.
Negotiations are going on as to the
form of the note by which the invi
AJtSoh is to be extended to the other
"powers.*' I recommend th? legislation
necessary on the part of the United
States to Bring into operation the ar
ticles of the treaty relating to the
fisheries, and to thc other malters
? touching the felatious of the United
Statos ''towards; the British North
American posseaaioas, to become op
erative as soon as, .proper legislation
shall Jbe haddon the part? of;. Great
Britain .audits possessions. It is much
..to'jty:repaired . that: this legislation
may. become operative before : the
fishermen of the United States begin
to make their arrangements for the
coming- season.

securing to all citizens pf the.Un:
States, the 'peaceful enjoyment of.

Constitution and the laws. .
After the passage_ of this ^w
formation was received from time
time that combinations, of the cl
acter referred to in this law exis
aud were powerful in many, parts
the Southern States, particularly
certain counties of the State of So
Carolina. Careful investigation
. made, and it was ascertained that
.nine counties of that State such c
bihatione were active and power
embracing a sufficient portion of
citizens, to control the local. ?uth
tie-5, and having, -among other thii
the object of depriving the ema:
pated class of the substantial bene
of freedom, and of preventing
free political action of those citiz
who did not sympathize with .tl
own views. Among their ?per?ti
were frequent scourging and bccaei
al-as?assinat?ons, generally perpel
ted at hight by disguised persons,
victims in almost all cases being c
zens of different .'political sen time
from their own, or freed persona v
had shown a. disposition to "ch
equal. - rights, with other ^citizc
Thousand-*" of inoffensive kn? v
disposed citizens were the sufferers
this lawless violence.
Thereupon, upon the 12th of Qc
ber, 1871, a proclamation was issi
. in; the terms of the law, calling uj
members of those ' combinations
disperse within five- days, and to i
liver to the marshal Or military-: c
cerS of the United States all an
ammunition, uniforms, disguises, a
? other means and implements used
them for carrying out their urilaw
purposes. . This warning not havi
been heeded, on the 17th of Octol
another proclamation was issued, s
pending the privilege of the writ
Habeas Corpus in nine counties
that S?tate. Direction was given tl
within the counties so designatedp
,sons supposed, upon creditable
formation, tOybe members :of such t
lawful combinations should be arre
ed by the military forces of, the U

shal, to be dealt with according,
law. " In two of said counties, Yo

one hundred and sixty-eight.

BEHOVAL OF DISABILITIES.
More, than six years having pa-se
since the last hostile gun was fire
between the two armierf then arraye
against each other-one for the pei
petuation, the other for the destruc
tion of the Union-it may well i>
considered whether it is not now tim
that the disabilities imposed by th
i 4th amendment should be removed
That amendment does not exclnd
the ballot, bat onlv imposes the disa
bility to hold office upon certaii
classes. When the purity of the bal
lot is secured, majorities are sure t<
elect officers reflecting the views o:
the majority.
I do not see the advantage or pro
priety of excluding men from offici
merely because they were before th<
rebellion, of standing and characte:
.sufficient to be elected to positious re
quiring them to take oaths to suppor
tue Constitution, and admitting tc
eligibility those entertaining precise
ly the same viewa, but of less stand
ing in their communities. It may bi
said that the former violated an oath
while the latter did not.
The latter did not have it in their
power to do so. If they had taken
this oath it cannot be doubted they
would have broken it, as did the for
mer class. If there are any great
criminals, distinguished above all oth
ers for the part they took in opposi
tion to the Government, they might,
in the judgment of Congress, be ex
cluded from such amnesty. This
subject is submitted for your careful
consideration.
The condition of the Southern
States is, unhappily, not such as all
true, patriotic citizens would, like to
see. Social ostracism for opinion's
sake, personal violence or threats to
wards persona entertaining political
views opposed to those entertained
by the majority of the old citizens
prevents-immigration and-the flow bf
much needed capital into the States
lately in-rebellion; It will be a hap
py condition of the country when the
old citizens of these States will take
an irterest in public affairs-promul
gate ideas honestly entertained, vote
formen representating their views,
and tolerate the same freedom of ex
pression and ballot to those entertain
ing different politicial convictions.

for making appointments, or the fault
of those wno recommend tor t?overn

well known to them . personally, or
who give letter endorsing the charac
ters of office-seekers without a prop
er sense of the grave responsibility
which such a course devolves upon
them. Civil service refoirn, which
can correct tmVahuso, is much de
sired. In mercantile pursuits the
business man wjbo gives a letter of
recommendation to a friend to enable
him to obtain credit from a stranger
.is regarded as morally responsible Tor
the integrity of hi* friends and his
ability to meet his obligations. A
reformatory law, which would enforce
this principle against all j endorsers
of perseus for public place, would
insure great caution in making re

A salutary lesson has been taught)
the careless and the dishonest public

two years. It is gratifying, to notice
the favorable change which has taken
place throughout the.country in bring
