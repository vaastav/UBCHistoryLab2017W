The annual message of tin
President of the United States is
u document that is always look
ed forward to with a ;ieat ileal
of anxiety as it ,renorally forms
the nucleus of legislation for the
session of congress following it.
The message just sent to con
gress hy President McKinley
lias none of the sensationalism
about it that some such docu
ments hhve had in the past, sucl
for instance as the message of
President (.'li-veland when he d
voted all (ft his time on one sub
ject. yet it is a very important
and a creditable paper. It:
whole tenor lellocts that can
tiousness that has characterize!
all of the Piesident's career
He tielioves in taking: one ste
at a time and not confusing mat
ters by attempting a second stej
ooioio in) nrsi one; lias ikmui
completed. His uttirances upon
the curnmcy, no doubt, fall shoit
of tho expin'tations of many but
they art emminently wise
mi i .
Alley seeic to lireveni a re-
currenre of past disastoj-.s whih
a permanent remedy is beine;
prepaii'd. Thf pri'sident advo
cates fointT'to the immediate
cause of tht1 present trouble by
re issuing the LTeonbacks only
t 1 -. . r . - . . ii i
ill exenau.e lor iroitl. lie also
flings to th( hope that sooner or
later bimetallism w ill win out,
although the efforts made
during the past year failed.
His reference to tho financial
plan proposed by Se rotary ( Ia;,rt
is indicative of the fact that, he
considers reforms in the curren
cy necessary.
The next important subject
discussed is the Cuban question
and in the handiinir of the pies
tioii he has shown the wisdom
of u conservative position. His
Utterances may be disappointit:
to many of the sympathetic
friends of ('aha hut the president
evidently bolioVes that the piv
eminent cannot be run on a sym
atUetic basis any mn'v than can
a'private business. The pith of
tho whoh matter is express"! in
the weirds.
