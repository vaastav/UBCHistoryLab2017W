Tho election of M. Sadl-Carnot. as
President of the French republic, Iu place
of M. Grevy took place on Saturday. He
was elected on the second ballot, receiving
C16 votes to 208 for all others. A sketch
of the new president will he found In an

seemed to be well received in Paris, and I

In the vote of the Hartford church to
sustain Its anarchist pastor, twenty men

Conventions of all sorts are tho proper
thine jst now. One of the latest called
is the national pure food convention which
will meet in Washington in January. It
principal object will be to Induce Congress
to take measures to prevent tho adulter
ation of foods and medicines. The mis
sion is a praiseworthy one for the evil
which the society seeks to correct is wide
spread. A majority of the 0000 bills Introduced;
at the last session of Cungress were pri
vate bills, and less than six per cent were
finally disposed of. (Many of these
will be reintroduced, and reinforced by as
many more, during the coming session.
The time may vry likely come when it
will be found advisable to devise some
method for relieving Congress from tho
burden of considering purely private bills.
Kveryoueof tho larger cities in the
country is trying to becuro one or more
of the national conventions next year, but
the members of the national committees
nre as a rule very reticent about express
ing their preferences. New York is not
likely to get the democratic convention
because a New York man will be nom
inated. Should indications point to some
Western man as the nominee of the re
publicans, as now seems possible, what
place id the Kast oilers better advantages

Some papers are still discussing the
need of u universal uniform decimal cur
rency and decimal system of time measure
ment. This is illustrated In a new clock
which has been put up at Wiesbaden.
This clock divides the day into ten hours,
the hour into ten decades, the decade into
ten minutes, the minute into ten seconds,
.uid Becond into ten rays. Similar units
take the place of the usual degrees, min
utes and seconds in the division ot the
circle. As long as the metric system of
weights and measuresand thetwetity-lour
o'clock idea do not meet with more popu
lar approval it is useless to push further

flection of a president calls attention to
Uiewide ditrereuco between republican

The annua) report of tho comptroller ot
the currency does not seem to Indicate
much fear that the national banking sys
tern wllj all go to pieces when tho govern

It shows that tho total number of new
banks organized last year was 225 making
80(11 in operation on tho last day lu Octo
ber. During tho year (rl went into vol
untary liquidation and ll!i failed. Of the
new banks, (lvo were organized in New
Kugland and New Kngland is responsible
for but one of the lit) failures. The net
Increase of capital for tho year is
$30,572,325. but on the other hand
there is a net decrease of SCO,
495,500 in the circulation rep
resented by bonds. The most Important
of the chauges recommended by Comptrol
ler Trenholm Is that tlio minimum
amount ot bonds to be deposited as secur
ity for circulation shall be ten per cent of
the capital ot banks of not over 250,000,
and seven per cent for banks of which the
capital exceeds $250,000 ; also that the
semi-annual duty on circulation be here
atter charged only on the amount Issued
upon bonds deposited in excess of the
minimum amount as above. He also
recommends that national bank notes
should be counted as part of the lawful

A Just Itelmke.
A peculiar kind of snobbery that has
for sometime prevailed in soma circles of
fashionable American society, paiticu
larly In and near the larger cities, has met
with a very mortifying rebuke. A young
man who had been for months palming
himself oft on the good people of Newark,
N. .1., as Lord Courtenay was, the other
day, discovered to bo an imposter and
dead-beat who had worked his game in
Baltimore and New York until lie was
detected and driven away from those cit
ies. Arriving lu Newark, with bonie good
clothes and some forged letters of intro
duction he was at once taken into the
circle of the "upper ten" there
dined and wined and made a social lion
generally. In return for these favors he
broke many fair hearts ; borrowed money
right and left from his gullible admirers,
and, when exposed, very quietly disap
peared: He was not uccivtd and petted
because he was especially bright or well
educated or intellectual, or a model young
mony lu any way. These fashionable
people in three cities made much of him
because he was believed to be connected
with the British aristocracy. They have
found out their mistake in a very hu
militatiug way and, his creditors, at
least, have bought their experience at
serious cost. The episode ought to serve
as a lesson to American Anglo-maniacs;

The President's Message.
Mr. Cleveland bus done wisely in com
plying with the advice which some of
the papers gave him awhile ago to omit
the customary rehash of tho department
reports, and go straight at the matters
concerning which he had any recommen
dations to make.
It was hardly necessary for him to
argue so elaborately the need of a a re
duction ol the revenue and of tho .surplus.
Republicans and democrats, wltli a lew
individual exception,, are agreed r hat the
surplus should be reduced and that it is
not wise to continue to raise so much
more money than is needed for the sup
port of the government. Almost all, also,
are agreed that there miut ne a readjust
meut of tlio tariff and a reduction of some
of the dtitle". The practical question is
whether the reductions shall be made
from the point of view and according to
the methods of tne free trader, or fr-im the
point of view and according to methods
which commend themselves to the friends
of protection of Ameican Industry.
Mr. Cleveland's attitude on the sub
ject, is in the main that of the free trade
democracy. He would admit fiee nearly
all the raw materials uied in manufac
tures. His arguiueut on the subject of
free wool will not commend itself to the
fanners. Ho embodies iu It the oft-exploded
assertion that the duty is iu all
cases added to the cost of tho manufac
tured article and paid by the consumer.
On the contrary, as has been so often
shown, the effect of free trade is often to
raise the prices of the manufactured ar
tide. Ia the long run, tills is tho way it
works. When the duty Is taken off the
foreign manufacturer employing chesp
labor is able to undersell the American
manufacturer. The latter oes out"' tho
business. Having thus got control of the
American market the foreign nianutact
urer puts up the prices of his goods and
tho consumer must pay more for them
than he did before the duty was taken
oir. Yet tho American manufacturer dare
not start his mill again , lor ho would bo
again broken down by the process which
proved effectual before. On the other
hand protection, by stimulating homo in
dustry, secures a healthy homo compe
tition, and coupled with the Inveuiive
genius of our people in tlio introduction
of improved machinery, often results in a
heavy reduction of prices to consumers.
If there are American manufactures bo
firmly established that they are beyond
fear of disaster from foreign competition
and tho pauper labor of the old world, let
the duties which have fostered them ho
reduced ; but let the reduction bo shaped
by the true friends of American industry.
The Cuhiiicl Changes
havo been so fully forestalled that tho
announcementof them creates no surprise
and but languid Interest. The worst tiling
about them, no doubt, Is the elevation of
Mr. Lamar to tlio bench ot tlio Supremo
Court. Tills cannot bo culled a lit ap
pointment, for a Judge of the Supremo
Court should bo pre-eminently a lawyer.
.Mr. Lutnar, according to tho testimony
of eminent lawyers, knows no law. Hu
has been described as "a lawyer who never
had a case, a soldier who never fought a
battle, a professor who never was gradu
ated from n college, a diplomatist who
never was successful, and a senator whose
own Statu renucsted him to rc'slgtl his
high representative ollice." Tho fact
that ho silenced a witness by threats
and a murderous assault In a Southern
court room, sotno years ago, docs not indi
cate a judicial temperament, and his ago
is rccagnized as a tcrlous objection,
though hi to this there Is u curious uncer
tainty. He, It la reported, says he Is sixty
three years old. Lanniau's Dictionary of
Congress, in its earlier editions, says he
was bom In 18211. Tho Washington cor
respondent of the Boston Transcript says
"tho records of tho time of Ills congres
sional servine before the rebellion indicate
that ho Is sixty-eight." If It shall be made
to appear that tho Dictionary of Congress
or the Tramcrlpt correspondent Is right,
his confirmation will rub hard. It other
wise lit, it would not be good polley to
place on the bench a man who will iu two
years reach the ago of retirement.
