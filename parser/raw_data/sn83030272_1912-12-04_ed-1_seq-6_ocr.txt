Mr, Hock Kt id that to his knovivHice? a
more ntrm.lni; imd radical cou.eiitiou
thflsnovor lxxu Kiitinilttcil to the .Supremo
'..Court than that of tho Holicitor-Uonerul,
who said In tho (Jovornnient h brief:
, "ConRrcus has, and of neceHsity must
have, absolute powor to say what it will
excludo'nnd what It will carry in the
malls mid tho terms, conditions and
postal rates on which it will curry mail
matter. We HUbmit therefore that
GongrPss.hiH tho unrestrained power to
iwjr what in its opinion in so hurtful to
tho publio welfare that it shall not pass
through tho malls, and that it niav etitoice
that opinion without its correctness Mug
subject to judicial review. It
kurely may proscrilie any conditions con
cerning the, mail matter itself, whether
Its to size, weight, character of contents,
purposo for which sent, Ac , and it may
likowlso prescribe conditions con corn! tig
tho persons depositing it in the mail,
especially if the conditions attached to
,tht sender lienr some relation to the thing
sent. If such views thoo of
a newbpaper owuer's are expressed in
the paper Congress can doubtless exclude
.them, just as Congress could now exclude
nil papers advocating lotteries, prohibi
tion, anarchy or protective tariff, if a
majority of Congress thought such views
HgnhiKt public policy."
If tho foregoing opinion is to prevail.
Mr. Hock argued. Congress could deny
second class privileges to a newspaper,
mile, it editorially supported the views
of a majority of Congress as to tariff
revision, nnd the courts would bo power
less to prevent, such strangling of free
discussion. Said Mr Beck:
"If so, it must logically follow that
the next Congress could not onlv bribe
i tho newspaper press into acceptance of
lower tariff duties, by tho privilege of
cheap or free postage, but it could force
ihem into such acquiescence hv tho
denial of any mailing facilities what
ever. "The contention of absolute power now
put forth without reservation is the
very one at which Daniel Webster, when
a like proposition was made to purge
the mails from nnti-slaverv political
documents, was 'shocked.' and to which
the great interpreter of the Constitution
replied: 'Any law distinguishing what
shall or what shall not go into the malls,
founded on tho sentiments of the paper,
and making a Deputy Postmaster a
Judge 1 should sav is expresslv uucon
htitutional.'" Admitting that no American Congress
would so offend the spirit of our institu
tions as to take advantage of ail the
possibilities of the newspaper law in
dicated by the Government. Mr. Heck
pointed out that if tho Solicitor-denerai's
Interpretation is accepted Congreps could
force from the mails any editor or pub
lisher, unless ho agreed," for instance, to
vow tno pronitiitlou ticket, support
the suffragette cause and appropriate
half of his columns to tho advocacy of
these political views.
"The Government's contention." he
said, "does not limit the power of Con
gress to prescribe conditions as to the
thing sent but also to the sender, and
if this power be an 'absolute' power
then it can determine the conditions
Upon which tho postal facilities cuti bo
Used, and it logically follows that tho
conditions can refer to the citizen who
Use tho mails as well as to the mail
natter itwlf. If this be true the ad
vocates of a judicial recall need not
waste further effort in advocating that
method of overriding the Constitution,
Cor Congress emi accompll-h many pur
poses which under the Tenth Amendment
were reserved to the States bv the simple
device of compelling tho citien to do
things in themselves heyoiwl Federal
power if he wishes to use the mails "
Nimllarly. Mr Heck said, Congress could
comiwl such institutions as clearing
housed or stock exchanges to conform
tff the Federal law bv denvim; them th..
use of the mails unless they accepted
such conditions as Congress might '
prescriue. uitnougn sucti int iitutiotn, are .

SOCIETY MEMENTOES STOLEN.
Ward Mr MlUlrr'a Son's llnnie Via
I led t llnrular.
The home of Ileyward Hall McAllis
ter, son of Ward McAllister, for many
years the social lender of New York
society, nt Summit, N. J., tvns entered
by a burglar nbout two weeks ago. A
large quantity of silverware and valu
able souvenirs of social events of years
ago was stolen.
The Intrinsic value of the articles is
about $3,000, hut their value as memen
toes1 of old Xew York society Is much
larger and Mr. McAllister has engaxed
the Petersen detective agency to recover
the goods. Capt. T. von S. Petersen
jays that he knows the thief, who Is
an old time crook, and he hopes to land
him nnd recover the goods.
The robbery took place In the early
morning hours, when those In the house
were all asleep. They found ut bleak
fast 'time that the house had been en
tered through a dining room window.
The burglar ransacked the room at his
leisure.
The burglar's loot Includes a part of
an old sliver set which was used In the
farm dinners given by Ward McAllister
on the rocki of Newport. Souvenirs of
the llrst cotillon dinner given In New
port, of which Mr. McAllister was host:
souvenirs of tho ball In the Academy of
Music on the occuslon of the then Prince
of Wales's visit; relics of the blue room
parties In old Delmonlco's, of the
"Mother (loose" ball at Dodworth's, of
tho famous swan dinner of 1884 at which
the guests sat about a mlnature lako
on which swans tloated, and many other
priceless reminders of the old social
life of New Y'ork wero carried away by
the thief.
Many gifts from Mrs. William Wal
dorf Astor to Ward McAllister at the
time when they wero forming tho social
four hundred escaped the burglar.
Other gifts from Commodore Vander
bllt, Lord Frederick Cavendish, Mrs,
Abraham van iluren, and others whose
names wero words to conjure with In
the society of those days, wero passed
over after being overhauled.
Many dinner pieces handed down to
Mis, Hey ward McAllister, who was
Jeanne ilenke Debertrand, were stolen,
as well as pieces that have been In the
McAllster family since before Ward Mc
Allister's time. A silver Wagon and
large basket, which are over 300 years
old. were ovet looked.
Ward McAllister's relics were divided
after his death between his daughter,
Miss Iconise McAllister, and his son
Hoyward. Many of tho most valuable
pieces were bought In Kuropo In tho
lato 'S0 and figured In the dinners
which nude him world famous as a
host.

THAT'S "T. It.'S POSITION
Itoosevelt and I'rendersast Uis
citss Progressive State
Chairmanship.
( ol l,ooeveltund Comptroller Prouder
gast lunched together yesterday and
discussed tho question of fusion nnd
tho eligibility of Asrmhlymnn Theodore
Doughs Itobinson of Herkimer county,
the Colonel's nephew, for tho State chair
manship of the Progressive wrty.
Col. Itoosevelt has kept his peace In lhe
presence of reporters ns far ns his
nephew's candidacy is concerned. He
would i.ot say a word about it yester
day. Hut tho Colonel is far from deny
ing that Theodoro Douglas Itobinson
would not be a good choice. His friends
say that if young Mr, Itobinson were
not the Colonel's nephew he would be
out for him in a minute, hammer and
tongs.
"The Colonel will not lay himself open
to the charge of nepotism," was tho way
one man put it yesterday. "Ho will not
openly or secretly favor the election
of Itobinson. Hut ho will not openly
or secretly favor any one else. It is n
case of hands off, with the presumption
strongly In favor of Mr Itobinson."
When Mr, Hntchkiss first decided that
his business affairs were such that he
had to leave the active control of tho
Rtate machinery in other hands the ques
tion of his successor was talked over
with Col. Itoosevelt. Tho Colonel listened
to tho names of various' candidates and
... I. ! . 1 .1 i
" nT-n ju iieiii.'vi nw mentioned lie,.
threw on his hands and remarked that.
he could tako no part in the selection '
of the new State chairman. But it was
clear that if the single matter of relation
ship could tie ruled out the Colonel would
stand for the elect ion of Mr Robinson .
Comptroller Prendereast told Mr.
Roosevelt that hu didn't approve of As
semblyman Robinson for chairman. Ho
bused his disapproval, he said, portly
upon Mr. Robinson's youth and lack of
exerience nnd partly on tho relationship
which Mr. Robinson bears to Col. Roosq.
velt He didn't think it politio to choose
as State chairman a man quite so close
to the throne.
The Comptroller's candidate is ex-Judge
Virgil K Kellogg of Watertown Cliuun
cey J Hamlin of buffalo has also been
mentioned as a possible successor to Sir.
Hotchkiss.
Mr. Hotchkiss himself favors the candi
dacy of Mr Robinson. He and Comptroller
Prendergast have differed on many mat
ters of party policy
lltnotliy l Woodruff is said not to be
a candidate forjthe State chairmanship,
and Comptroller Prendcrgust said yes
terday that so far as he knew Kings county
had no candidate. Mr Woodruff liw
spoken favorably the Colonel's nephew.
Assemblyman Hobinson himself ex
pects to win, and it is possible thut there
may lie no light. He voiced his expecta
tions yesterday, but when asked about
his position on fusion said. "I won't talk
about that until I'm elected if I'm
elected "
Just what form the discussion of fusion
took neither Col. Hoosevolt nor Mr. Pren
dergast would say, but tho Comptroller
did say: "1 never felt more hoiieful
about fusion than 1 do now."
He added that ho wished ho fell as sure
aliout all the predictions he is called upon
to make as he did about the assertion
that the local Progressives will surely
fuse,
While Col. Itoosevelt wouldn't discuss
the mutter it is known that ho is strongly
in fuvor of fusion in the city campaign
and on purely local issues. Oscar H.
Straus, who was tho Progressive candi
date for Governor, is said by Comptroller
Prendergast to l on the fusion side.
On the other hand many of the local
Progressives, including the retiring State
chairman, ore opposed to tho fusion idea.
They hold that tho party cannot well
fuse with any others, even to defeat
Tammany, and thut fusion is contrary
to the ideals of tho Progressives.
Col. Itoosevelt has taken on weight
since the campaign, and it was said that
his wound was giving no trouble.
MoKENNA GOES TO DEATH HOUSE.
Writ on Grounds Involtlnv Bronx
Count r Kail.
Justice Seabury sent Joseph J Mc
Kenna, who murdered Sigfried Kckstrom,
back to the death house in Sing Sing
yesterday. McKonna. who waa sen
tenced on October 31 by Judge Rosalsky
to die in the week of December , sought
to have his conviction upset on the ground
that the Court of General Sessions did not
have jurisdiction under the Bronx county
act. Justice Seaburv rulod that, the act.
Hhould have no bearing on a crime com
mitted last June, when McKenna strnn
gled tho girl.
Some lawyers maintained that if Jus
tice Seabury sustained tho writ of habeas
corpus obtained by McKenna It would
havo a bearing tho trials of Lieut, Becker
and tno gunmen on the ground that
jurors from another county served at the
trials. This question wasn't settled.

Mo.VTCLAtR, N. J , Dec. 3. Should tho
portrait of the late Georgo Inness, the fa
mous American artist, found among the
debris of his old home on Grove street
in this town by Herwick C. Dodge, prove

there may lie bitter litigation over its
ownership ,
Mr. Dodge has been Berved with notice
by Ernest S, SulTern, president of the
Realty Improvement Company .which owns

believes the picture was painted by Inness
himself and is worth $10,000.
