December 12, 1886. J
Don't turn up your nose at
the thoughts of an overcoat
beine at a five dollar price.
The When's "Storm King"
isn't to be sneezed over or un
der. It's a garment that
would cost in the ordinary way
of doing the overcoat busi
ness, at the very least, for an
eight dollar bill.
Some have found it out, but
we print again for those who
have not. If you would own
eight dollars' worth of coat for
an outlay of five, see the When
Storm king.
1 here are things to learn
and ways of doing at the
When which isn't likely to be
stumbled onto among ordinary
price - changing, gift - giving
dealers outside.
All the coat cost and a lit
tle more is marked plainly on
ticket attached to the hanger'
You'll buy at the marked price
and be wise first, or pay a few
dollars more outside and be
wise when too late.
We differ in price and in
selling ; couldn't do otherwise
and expect to keep the big
ship sailing.
You'll find a great many
stylish, elegantly trimmed
overcoats on our tables just as
long as the calling season
holds on, and we, with our
manufacturing advantages,
will endeavor to keep prices
down within reach of every
needing man's purse.
We hope everybody'll get
their money's worth just this
much. If you don't find
everything about our garments
exactly as represented, and
price twenty per cent, be
low any competition any
where, any time, come back
to the When with your griev
ances and have them repaired.
If you're not already ac
quainted with the styles and
qualities we are building- in
overcoats, orthe prices for
which they are sold, you are
a step or two deficient in
knowledge of what is the
proper style to pick and price
to pay.
Christmas isn't far ahaad.
You'll bear in mind, please,

The President's Kecommemlatlons
Meet
With a Cold Reception.
Washington-, Dec 13. It is understood
that noneof the specific er important recom
mendations of the president in his message
to congress will be taken up for fulfillment
by the house committee on ways and
means. The document has been laid be
fore the committee, which finds that them
is so much In it to elicit pro
longed and Jacrimonious debate; that
the recommendations, seriatuiu. will
not, as is customary, be given attention.
The various committees having appropria
tion bills to prepare will go as far as posi
ble in gratifying the president's desires.
Hut the rale adopted at the last session,
which prohibits new legislation in appro
priation bills will make it Impossible for
any ery iotent legislation to be enacted as
the result of the president's message. The
friends of Chairman Morrison of ways and
means say that it is not true that Irts un
friendliness to the president is the cause of

are spoken of for diplomatic positions.
There are at least fifteen of them, and it all

Washington. Dec 13. It is announced
at the I'Ostoftice department that forty va
cancies occur every day on the average from
death, resignation or other reasonsin post
offices throughout the country. There have
been suspended and created more postoffices
during the past eighteen months than there
were during the four years immediately
preceding the administration of President
Cleveland. The number of postoflices is
gradually decreasing. This is explained by
the fact that a great many resignations oc
cur through the politics of the administra
tion, the old officers not desiring to serve,
and there being a difficulty In procuring
new officers, the offices are suspended. In
these suspensions a less number are rejuv
enated than are closed up.

Washington, Dec. 13. House On
motion of Mr. Peters (Kas.), a bill was
nassed extending the laws of the United
States oer certain unorganized territory
south of the state of Kansas, known as the
Public I.anil StriD. and providing that this
land shall be subject to entry by actual set
tlers under tho homestead law.
The speaker announced the appointment
of Morrison, Harris and Mckinley as con
ferees on the fractional gallon bill, and of
Cobb. Eaton and Payson on the Allen land
lord bill.
Mr. Kandall (Pa.) moved that the house
proceed to the consideration of the sundry
civil appropriation bill, but the motion was
lost jeas 11U, nays 121.
hi the morning hour Mr. Paysnn (III.),
on liehalf of the committed on public lands
called up the bill declaring the fortfeit
ure of the Ontonagon and llrule river land
grant. In detailing the circumstances of
the grant. Mr. Paj son declared that from
the organization of the Ontonagon ami
Hrule Itiver company no step had been
taken bv it which did not indicate that the
organization bad been purely speculative,
and effected for the purposo of getting
land from the general government It had
been an attempt at barefaced robbery from
its commencement down to the present
time.
The bill was passed without a dlv ision
(It forfeits 334.C0O acres.)
The house then went Into committee of
the whole (Mr. Hammond (Ga.) in the
chair) ou the sundry civ il appropriation
bill.
In the course of the general debate, Mr.
Lanham (Tex.) made an appeal In favor of
the redemption of the trade dollar; and all
uding to the standard sliver dollar, he de
clared that Its coinage would never be sus
pended, on matter w ho might recommend
to the contrary
Mr. Herbert (Ala.), said that while the
sundry civil bill appropriated Icvs than the
bill of last jear, the decrease was attribut
able to the fact that the committee on ap
propriations had surrendered jurisdiction
over the items for navy-yards and the new
Xaval observatory, maintaining that those
items could be provided for in the regular
naval appropriation bill. Hecontended, on
the contrary, that the appropriations for
the objects namcl should be. made in the
sundry civil bill, which would then, instead
of showing a decrease, exceed lu amount
of appropriations the bill of last jear.
Mr. lUndill (Pa.)argured that the naval
committee had proper jurisdiction over the
subject of navy-varus, but pointed out that
even were they provided for in the pending
measure, the bill would still carry less mon
ey than that of last jear.
Pending further discussion, the com
mittee rose, and the house adjourned.

RESOLUTIONS OF RESPECT

Sir. Mat.
Yesterday the old officers of St Paul's
Sunday school retired from their offices,
and next Sunday the recently-elected offi
cers will take their placesT Superintendent
P. P. Mast and Secretary J. T. Hidgely
have been connected with the Sunday
xhool ever since it was orgauized, and
prior to that time were connected with the
Central M. E. Sunday school. That their
long and faithful services have been appre
ciated is ev inced by the following resolu
tions, passed by the Sunday school yester
day: Whereas, Ilecently at the close of their
terms of office, Bros. 1'. P. Mast superin
tendent and J. T. P.Idgely, secretary, of
St Paul Sunday school, declined a renomi

w ere relieved from further duty in their
responsible positions, so long and ably tilled
bv them. It Is deemed a fitting occasion to
express to them the sentiments of our
hearts. Therefore, be It
lteaolved. That we with high apprecia
tion of their services, do hereby tender to
these worthy brethren our most sincere
thanks, and assure them that the many les
sons of punctuality and fidelity vvhicli their
examples have taught us must ever awaken
In our minds a gratetul remeuiDrance.

In St Paul M. E. church since its oreanlza
tion until the present. It Is surely a source
of gratification for them to behold many of
their former pupils now rrovvn to Christian
manhood and womanhood, battling for the
cause ot God and humanity, and now rising
up to call these veteran leaders blessed,
Though during their labors time has been
busy furrowing their cheeks and whitening
their locks, yet it is our pleasing desire and
trust that their vigor may jet coutinue
many vears, and when at length their
natural strength shall be abated and the
summons come, may the great Judge say as
we can gladlj say : "Well done good and
faithful servants."
Respectfully submitted.
I). M. Bi'uns, cLairman.
The committee apiKiinted by the school
to draft the resolutions consisted of I). M.
Bums, William Schenck and W. J. Patter
son. The retiring superintendent, Mr. Mast, af
ter the resolutions had been unanimously
adopted by a rising vote, made a very earn
est and timely address to the school. He
said that the thirty vears during vvhicli lie
had been engaged m Sabbath school u oik,
were the happiest jears of his life. He
had endeavored to do liLs duty and believed
that the earnest work he had done would
tell on the school's good in after years. He
said that he might have done more in the
vears that ho had been superintendent of
the different schools, but lie had
worked faithfully and disinterested
ly. He wished the new superin
tendent the same measure of success
that had attended the school during his su
perintendency, and the same hearty sup
port of the teachers and officers that they
had given him. If he received this support
he would succeed and the school would pros

At the close of Mr. Mast's address there
were short addresses by the Iters. Mitchell

Public Meeting at Black's Opera House
Sunday Night in the Interests of

Heading of Ontclnl Keporti.
The extreme moistness of the atmosphere
Sunday afternoon and evening had rather
a dampening effect ou the public meeting
of associated charities last night at Black's.
The hall was probably half full, but never
theless the meeting was a good one, and the
cause In behalf of which the association is
laboring so faithfully, and, it might be
added, so successfully, was much benefited
thereby. The prime object to be attained
by these annual public meetings Is to more
thoroughly interest the citizens in chari
table work, esiecially as carried on by the
board of associate charities.
ltev. W. II. Warren, president of the
board, whose heart Is thoroughly enlisted
in this good work, presided. Beside him
was seated his faithful coadjutor, the su
perintendent H. II. Cumback. In addition
there were on tha platform the following
pastors and citizens: Drs. Falconer. Hel
wic. Gotwald. Fullerton, Kut Finiey
and Vincent Kector Rose and Rev. Wilkin
son, General J. Warren Kelfer, F. M. Ha
gan, Esq., John Foos, A. C. Black, and
City Clerk J. S. Shewalter. Rev. Dr. Run-
jan occupied a front seat among the audi
ence.
Printed slips with the hymns to be sung
were distributed among the audience. The
singing was led by a choir made up of the
Congregational church, re-enforced by other
singers. E. It Cheney directed the singing
and H. B. Hendley presided at the organ.
The exercises of the evening were opened
by the choir rendering that beautiful an
them, "in God is Uur Trust "
Rev. John T. Rose read a scripture lesson.
and Rev. Dr. Fullerton. pastor of the Sec
ond Presbyterian church, offered prayer,
closing with the Ixird's prater, in which the
audience joined.
The congregation then Joined In singing
God Guard the Poor.'' The first stanza is
follows :
(Ind guard the poor! we may not see.
The deepest sorrows ot the soul ;
These are laid open. Lord, to thee.
And subject to thy wise control.
Mr. Warren stated that he thought it
best, in order to bring the subject fully and
properly before the audience, to have
the president and superintendent read
parts of their animal rejiorts, which
have already been published in the
city paier8 and will soon be
printed lu form for general distribution.
He then read extracts from his own reiwrt.
selecting those parts especially which show
tne object and scope or tho association.
II. U. Cumback followed with exracts
from the superintendent's report. The
liortions selected treated particularly of the
efforts being put forth to
WKED OL'T ISVVOUTHV AITUPINTS
and for the promotion of provident habits.
Tbey also labor to arouse manhood and put
able-bodied and willing applicants in the
way of securing work.
One thousand, two hundred and seventy
liersons have been aided, during the past
year, at an outlay of 52.40 per capita.
General J. Warren Kelfer was the nrst
sjieaker introduced He said It was gener
ally thought wise to dispense with evening
serHees In the several churches and come
together here and discuss the best method
of caring for the poor. It was not intended
to take up a collection tomgnt but at tie
tame time he would impress It upon their
minds that the work will not run Itself
without financial aid. The work of the as
sociation is comprehensive. It does not
belong to the Incorporators. The means of
getting into the district auxiliaries are easy,
as whoever contributes call become a mem
ber, and any one paying 35 to the general
association can become a member of that
body. And it is to be hoped many more
will avail themselves of this pnvtlege, so
that the annual meetings may be more
lareely attended.
The needy poor, made so by accident
misfortune, etc, are to be distinguished
from paupers. In our charity we are In no

ADDICTED TO LlqUOIt
It is the worst thing you could do for him.
If he needs a meal, buy if for him; If a
ticket to some point buy it for him your
self: but never give him money.
Rev. Dr. W. C. Falconer, pastor of the
First Presbyterian churcli. followed
In a brief address. He said
he came with no prepared speech
but vv hat he did say came from Ids heart
We are to love all men. We are to love our
neighbors as ourselves. Our hearts are to
go out towards the unfortunate. If a city
like Chicago bums, evervbody opens bis
purse aud responds. If pestilence, famine
or earthquake spreads desolation abroad,
leople of all Christian countries hear the
cry of distress aud answer. The glory of
New York is not her great railroads, her
tine buildings and her lcammoth business
interest It Is her charity, her hospitals,
her asjlums. And I hope it will be so in
our city. 1 would emphasize the saying of
the association by giving only to worthy
cases. We need this organization to pre
vent this waste. Another thing that has
not been mentioned in the report I will
sjeak as a pastor and 1 believ e the other
pastors will agree with me. W e do not
want to have a single member of our
churches aided by this organization. The
churches w ill attend to their own poor and
deem It a pleasure.
The next speaker was F. M. Hagan,
Esq., who gave an intelligent and enter
taining talk. Humanity has some great
problems to solve. 1 believe that diseases
are better met and treated than one hundred
or fifty years ago. Still we have the prob
lem still with us. The poor we hav e witli
us alwajs, the problem we have to deal
with now. Individual attention is some
times best but the individual is limited in
means and kuowleilgo and time.
The congregation then sang three verses
of "We Give Thee But Thine Own," after
which
hev. di:. J. n. HELWto,
of the First Lutheran church, made a mas
terly talk, vvhicli was received with marked
applause. Hes.sjdever feature of this
important subject had already been
touched upon. Uur poor, how are we
to care for them? We must lift them
up in this country or they will pull us down.
They must be made better or the country
will be made vvosre. It is said that in Rome
there vv ere no charitable institutions. Mil
lions of people and no charity.- That was
paganism. Christianity is in slurp contrast
with this. The question with Christianity
is not what vv e teach or preach or profess
but what we do. The whole question has
settled down to this: What does Christian
ity do? Christians are at the head of this
organization and they go out among the
IHior and show what Christians can do for
them. Dear friends, I know of no city that
should take more interest in caring for its
poor. I will mention one thing,
now that I have returned after
four jears to jour midst At Akron
the reports were that Springfield has
hard times, that it is ou the back grade. I
was surprised to find more progress here
than at Akron, where they thought they
were getting along finely. The trouble
with Springfield is that it thinks it has hard
times unless it is booming tremendously.
Our greaj shops bring people here who sup
suppose of course they can get work here if
at no place else. Thus many people are
thrown onto our hands who must for a time
be cared for.
Mr. Hagan was recalled to speak, as one
of the hospital commissioners, concerning
the city hospital. He said there would not
now be a
WELL ASSCBED HOSPITAL
were It not for the efforts of this organlza-
tlon. He hoped the board of Associated
Charities would still aid in establishing and
building up the hospital.
ltev. Dr. Kust, of High Street M. E
church, was the last speaker of the evening
and made a brief but forcible talk. Another
song was sung and Hev. A. L. Wilkinson
made the closing praver.

rewarded. Stevens Is to be credited with a
good effort His acting is at all times
praiseworthy. A good degree of merit

Dixon an account of the sudden death of a
young man and his mother. Said Mrs.
Dixon, laying her hand on Mary's lap:
"God alone knows who of us will be alive

young lady was a corpse.

invitation. Miss Schaeffer obejed the sum

Cuunty Commissioner.
The only matter of importance before the
county commissioners this morning was a
proposition received from J. Warren Kelfer,
as attorney for the Springfield & Sidney
turnpike company, for the sale of their
road. The pike starts on the Valley pike,
northwest of the city, and extends past the
"bir spring" to within a mile of Lawrence
villa, where it terminates in the Reynolds
improved road, i here was never any toll
gate on th9 pike. Appraisers are asked for
and J. Roland Stafford was this mornine
appointed by the commissioners as one of
the number. The probate and common
pleas judges will at once make the other
two appointments. A rather laughable
thing is found in the document presented
to the commissioners. The road was called
Springfield and St Paris pike all the way
throuich. aud even so remains in the title,
and had to bo corrected to Sidney. It is
barely possible the owners have just dis
covered their property, and hardly know
what it really is.
Attempt tu Saddle a Montgomery County
Lunatic on tills City.
An affidavit was filed this forenoon be
fore Judge Miller for the purpose of having
au inquest of lunacy held on a voting man
named Charles E. Hughes. Judge Miller
soon discov ered that the man came here
crazy two weeks ago from Miami City, and
had previously been in the asjluiu from
Montgomery county. Judge McKeeney. of
that county, was telephoned to concerning
the case, but tried to saddle the man on
this county. Judge Miller, however, would
not have It that way, so Deputy Sheriff A.
J. Baker took the man to Da) ton on the
1 o'clock train.

DREAD DIPIITIIERIA.
How St. Bernard's School Suffered Daring
the Epidemic that Beigned in
Springfield.
Kxlianslive Report of the Plague Made by
Mr. T M. Ileaile to the Pastor and
Trustees ot at. Ilernanl's
Catholic Church.
The recent epidemic of diphtheria In
Springfield plaed terrible havoc in the
eastern part of the city and especlallj
airong the children who attended St Ber
nard's school. Out of the 203 pupils in
this school twenty deaths occurred and at
one time during Nov ember about one-half of
the pupils enrolled were out of school. The
situation was so serious that the pastor ami
trustees of St Bernard's church requested
Dr. T. M. Reade to investigate the epidemic
and if possible state the reasons w by St.
Bernard's school should suffer so terribly.
In accordance with this request Dr. Reade
presented the following able and Interesting
report:
To the Pastor and Trustees of St. Bernard's
The recent epidemic of
diphtheria was not confined to Springfield
but became general. Invading several towns
and country districts In this and adjoining
states, as well as some of the large cities
notably Cincinnati and St Iouls. The dis
ease became epidemic In this city about tl t
1st of October. Increasing its ravages until
the middle of November, declining towards
the end of the latter month and ceash g
about the 1st of December.
My attention was first called to the dlv
case affecting the children of St. Bernard's
school, by Rev. J. D. Kress, on November
8th. At his request I proceeded to investi
gate th cause of the disease In this locality
and introduce such measures of prevention
as the present staN of our knowledge ad
mits of. Allow me to remark in passing
that I consider this the most dangerous aad
ratal ot tne diseases of childhood, and no
single remedy has yet been discovered
which exercises a curative effect on this
malady.
The Importance of sanitary regulations.
bow ever, cannot be overestimated. Tkese
measures consist mainly lu affording the
scholars pure air. sufficient exercise, light
pure water, with rooms properly heated and
ventilated.
The following suggestions are resnectfullv
submitted for jour consideration.
1 visited the school for the first time No
vember S, and found In attendance only
HI pupils out of a roll of 203. I proceeded
to make a general examination of the phys
ical conuuiou oi tne pupils, and also the
sanitary condition of the school and its sur
roundings. I found ten children eitiier
suffering from throat disease or having
diphtheria in the family, none of those in
the school, however, having the disease.
I adopted the plan of total exclusion of all
w ho had throat diseaso of any kind, or any
who were known to have contadous dis
ease in their homes.
I requested that the rooms be closed and
thoroughly fumigated with burnt sulDhur.
and that the cellars, drains and privies be
disinfected with chlorinated lime. I ex
amined the four classrooms and found them
models of cleanliness, properly ventilated
witn an ammdant supply of fresh air from
the lowered tops of the windows, heated by
large open stoves which are generously sup
plied witli bituminous coal and provided
with water evaporators. Th lighting of
the rooms is all that can be desired for the
strength and protection of the eye and the
maintenance or perrect vision. Sufficient
recreation is allowed the children in the
spacious playground attached to the school.
1 he general apiiearance of the children Is
that of good health. The cellars are clean,
dry and well ventilated. The building it
self Is situated on high grouid. every room
being accessible; to sunshine. The sanitary
condition of the rooms is perfect In every
thing that concerns the management the
sisters have done their part so well that the
most rigid scrutiny cannot dtect an error
or suggest an improvement
We have to seek somewhere else for a
cause and a reason why this school should
be singled out and afflicted more than any
other in the city, by this deadly visitor.
which has carried off ten per cent of the
children of this congregation. Before re
ferring to water, drainage, sewerage, etc,
here, I wish to state that the same condi
tions of defective drainage and water com
tami nation which are found here are com
mon throughout all that portion of the city
which forms the hillside and valley between
east High street and Buck creek. The Im
mense quantity of water which flows from
the hillside is undoubtedly pure at its
source, but it goes through woful mixing
before it enters the wells in the vallej- and
still more before it passes the mouths of
the consumers.
The water supply of this school is ob
tained from a spring at the north side of the
j-ard, which yields a constant stream of
clear, sparkling water. I was enabled,
through the courtesy of Dr. C. W. Duntap.
to examine some specimens with the micro
scope, and no germs of disease could be dis
cov ered, although there were deposits found
hicu favor the development
I d not daslre to condemn this water, or
advise you to abandon its us, as a bever
age, but I will ask you to so chance its sur
roundings as to make it pure and whole
some. It Ls undoubtedly a bearer of disease
germs at certain seasons of the year. Thyse
germs can be destroyed by boiling or elimi
nates by the Pasteur filter, which is the
property of Dr. Blount of this city. The
most likely cause of this water contamina
tion is a privy situated within thirty feet of
the spring and on higher ground directly in
the line of drainage. 1 wou.'d recommend
that this privy be abandoued, and
that one be constructed in its stead
at a safe distance from the spring.
I examined the open drain which imper
fectly conducts the sewerage of a large por
tion of the neighborhood into and through
the church property. This Is a most offen
sive: and iKwi-breeding nuisance. It passes
within ten feet of the sisters' residence and
within forty feet of the school building, ex
posing the occupants to the influence of half
a mile of houe drainage. Every effort
should be made by the congregation and
board of trustees to induce the city to re
lieve you of the aborainat'on, by construct
ing a sewer in the neighborhood.
I examined the boys' and girls' privies and
found them sufficient in size and number,
properly arranged for privacj- and decencj-.
but in bad sanitary condition, as the depos
its in them accumulate on the surface of
the ground. They are built bridge-like
across the drain, and so much exposed to the
bottom that a constant draft of wind passes
through them causing much suffering to
children in cold weather. The exposure
thus endured often proves a serious cause of
disease in little guls whose delicacy and
tender years make them a speolal object of
solicitude. I would recommend that these
privies be abandoned altogether, and that
vaults be dug with these or such structures
placed upon them as would afford more
shelter as well as cleanliness and comfort

I made six visits in all to the school dur
ing the epidemic The sisters kindly as
sisted me In my efforts to arrest the pro
gress of the disease, and they with the rev
erend pastor promptly carried out all in
structions. The school Jhas now resumed
its course. The scholars have returned,
but twenty lllt'e seats are empty. The con
gregation of St Bernard has suffered much
this year. It Is a terrible example and the
lesson Is: Let us go to work with a will
and put our house in order so that when the
enemy comes again he will find no habita

TEMPERANCE HALL MATTERS.
Two Good Meeting lesterriae. With
Misty Slifoers future Announcement.
Notwithstanding the threatening aspect
of the weather ye-derday afternoon the at
tendance at the Temperance hall Baud of
Hope was as large as ever. There were
about thirty signers, several of the number
being secured at the gospel temperance
meeting which followed. The superinten
dent read a poem on "Pansys," bj a
friend.
He aIo read a letter from the Cawker
City (Kansas) Band of Hope to Springfield
Band of Hope, under date of November 13.
The letter had been sent to Mother Stewart
who had spoken In their city and called at
tention to this wonderful Band of Hope at
Temperance hall. Concerning Mother
Stewart the letter sajs : "Her visit and
address here were very much apprc-
ciated and will encourage us in
the work. We think she is
doing a grand work and will lead many to
follow in her footsteis." the Hand Is only
eight mouths old aud the numbers not very
large, but It Is doing a good work. The let
ter closes as follows: "We, as j-oung peo
ple, need all the knowledge we can obtain
on the subject of temperance, as soon we
shall be the men and women who are to
carrj- on this great work. Our Band of
Hope Is doing good in this direction and we
think it will do a great deal more. There
are many children and jouug people com
ing into our midst and we know that they
will be greatly benefited .by our Band, of
Hope."
Two recitations were given. The first
was by a little mite of a girl Grade Bur
nett entitled "Midget" and was charm
ingly rendered. Charles Woods spoke of
Santa Claus," and did it nicely.
Each of the children was given a copy of
Mr. Young's Sunday school paper. Sun

GOSrtX TEMPKIIAXCE MEETIXO.
The Gospel temperance meetingwas mod
erately well attended, but the meeting was
a good one. far beyond Its numbers, in
number of signers. sieeches made and in
terest dlsplaj ed. Uncle Abe Ludlow, the
temperance patriarch presided as usual,
and was very happy In his remarks at dif
ferent stages of the meeting. Rev. J. U.
Roberts, pastor of Trinity Babtist churclu
conducted the devotional exercises, reading
the fifth chapterof Luke, beginning at verse
IS as a scripture lesson and offering up a
short but pathetic prayer.
I he speakers were Wiirxr Coivin. Rev.
J. II. Roberts. Rev. Cyrus Rightmjerand
Kev. a. 11. Whitaker. The latter is a pas
tor a short distance from Milwaukee. Wis.
He is in the city for a few days visiting rel
atives. His address was marked with great
power and earnestness, and wa-s highly ap
predated by the audience. Tho other
speeches were also very excellent ones. .Mr.
Coivin, while a worker In other lines of
the temperance agitition, had never before
spoken in these meetings, but his effort
was not only unexceptional to the most crit
ical, but was a carefully prepared aud fin
ished address. Exactly thirty sign
ers were secured to the pledge, including
a large number of j-oung men. More than
half the signers were secured after the
meeting proper was closed.
Next Sunday the meetings will be held
in the Sundaj- school room of thA First

The N'ew Methodltt Church at MooreUeld
Dedicated Sunday by Rev. Dr. A. I!.
Leonnrd.
For some years the Methodists of Moorc-
field have had in contemplation the build
ing of a new church edifice in the village.
For three years past the ladies of the church,
backed efficiently by the gentlemen, have
run the dining hall at the Urbana camp
meeting. In this they have been very suc
cessful and as a result thej- obtained over
S2.000 toward the building fund. During
the past year, through many trials and trib
ulationsfor the membership ot the church
is less than twenty a beautiful little
church was erected at a cost of 33,300. It
Is neatly furnished on the Inside and a fine
toned organ has been purchased.
Yesterday the church was appropriately
dedicated to the service of God. The peo
ple turned out en masse, and the building
was filled to overflowing. Kev. Dr. Leon
ard preached a strong sermon from Jere
miah, 0-16: "Thus saith the Lord, stand
ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the
old paths, w here is tne good way, and walk
therein, and je shall nnd rest for your
souls." ltev. E. BinlselL of South Charles
ton, and the pastor. Rev. J. II. Middleton,
assisted In the services. After the sermon
Dr. Leonard succeeded in raising over SSOO
against the 300 indebtedness remaining on
the building. The edifice was then dedi
cated according to the forms of the Method
ist church discipline. The doctor preached
again In the evening to a large audience.
Collision 3iarrowljr Averted.
A bad collision was narrowly averted
yesterday afternoon about 4 o'clock in the
west end. A Bee Line pony was sw itching
near Isabella street when a heavy freight
train drawn by a big camel-back hove In
sight on the same track. The engineer of
the camel-back reversed his engine and
whistled, but the track was so slippery and
his train so heavy that the engines were
a few feet apart w heu they came to a stand
still. The whistling attracted the attention
of the entire neighborhood.
