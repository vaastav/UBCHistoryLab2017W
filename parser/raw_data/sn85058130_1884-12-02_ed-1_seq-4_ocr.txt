THE II ESSAG1f i j 1
President Arthurs farewell annua
message to Congress was presented on
Monday and ppciars in full in this
issue of THE HEBATLD It is not a great
statepqper likesome outs predecessors
and it will not gothundering down the
ages Jf There is nothing gnat aboa
Mr Author unless it be the eimiitt
fit of his pantaloons or the artistic cut
of his beard again there is nothing in
I 6
the present condition of the country to i
call forth a great message Circum =
stances make men as opportunities
furnish material for brilliant and able
Presidential messages The country is
fortunate in its tranquil condition but
f
Mr Arthur seems to be de
plorably unfortunate in wanting
the chance to make farewell annual
t i communication to Congress a paper that
will excite attention above common
1 place and live longer than the hour
i in which it was being read However
considering the circumstances and the
r opportunities presented this last mes
sage of President Arthur must be re
gaMed fair1g cod Je has made as
much of the Situation as possibleas
l f much in fact as anyone could have
fi i done and has given us a paper that con
k
tains many really wise suggestions and
commendable recommendations
As a matte or course there is a refer
ence to ttJiii The message of a Re =
publican President that did not contain
I
an attack upon poor Utah would be an
anomaly Happily we will be afflicted
> by no more Republican Presidents and
perhaps Congress will hereafter escape
the annual prod which means little or
nothing and hch is merely inserted
to comport with the party platform and
tickle the meddlesome people who are
so deeply interested in the affairs of
others whether or I1 they pay much
attention to their own Last year Mr
Arthur said in his message
The Utah Commission has submitted
to the Secretary of the Interior its sec
I ond annual report As a result of its
t labors in supervising the recent election
in that Territory pursuant to the act
of March 22 1882 it appears that per
sons by that act disqualified to the
number of abort t 12000 were expluded
y from the polls This fact however af
fords little cause for congratulation and
I fear fhat it is far from indicating any
real and substantial progress toward the
extirpation of polygamy All the mem
berselect of the Legislature are Mor
mons There is grave reason to believe
that they are in sympathy with the
practices that this government is seek
ing to suppress and that its efforts in
that regard will be more likely to en
counter their opposition than receive
their encouragement and support
Even if this view should happily he er
Toneous the law under which the Com
missioners have been acting should be
made more effective by the incorpora
tion of some such stringent amend
ments as they recommend and as were
included in bill No 2238 on the calendar
I of the Senate at its last session
I am convinced however that polyg
amy has become so strongly intrenched
in the Territory of Utah that it is profit
L less to attack it with any but the stout
s est weapons which constitutional legis
lation can fashion I favor therefore the
repeal of the act upon which the exist
ing government depends the assump
tion oy the national legislature of the
entire political control of the Territory
and the establishment t of a commision
a with such powers and duties as shall be
delegated to it by law
This time he says < t
The report of the Utah Commission
will be read with interest It discloses
the results of recent legislation looking
to the prevention and punishment of j
polygamy in that Territory I still oL1 j
sieve that if that abominable practice
can be suppressed by law it can only j
be by the most radical legislation I con i
sistent with the Constitution I again
recommend therefore that Congress j
assume absolute political control of the
Territory Utah and provide for > the
appointment of a Commission with
such governmental power as in its judg
ment may justly and wisely be put into
their hands
It will thus be seen that the President
has held to the idea and almost to the
language furnished him in 1883 as cor =
rectly rumored by Governor Murray
This time the Utah reference is
shorter indicating that Arthur
rather than Murray wrote it on
the present occasion For the
present brevity we thank the President
The recommendation itself is unimport
ant and immaterial in view of its vicious
ness and also in view of the fact that
the present Congress has only three
months of life all of which must be de
voted to weightier matters than the
regulation of the morals of a Territory
which is peaceful prosperous quiet and
contented
Altogether President Arthur has con
cluded his series of messages with one
that is neither brilliant nor dim it is
mediocre and therefore like its author
The next message to Congress will b
read with a good deal more interest
than this one
M
THE WESTERN UNION office in this
city is entitled to the highest praise for
the manner in which it received the
I Presidents message on Monday Of
the many Presidential messages han
dled by THE HERALD none has ever
come in better shape than that which
appears in this issue No part was
missing and the clerical errors were so
few as to be scarcely noticeable That
such a document can be transmitted
across the continent in the course of a
few hours passing through many
hands and ie handed out at this end of
the line in complete form and com
paratively free from mistakes and what
are known in telegraph parlance as
bulls is something wonderful and
shows to what a high state of efficiency
the Western Union has brought the
telegraphic service
IN THE course or his Sunday afternoon
sermon a week ago the Rev Burchard
asked Why am I not in heaven
Blaine would like to know why he isnt
