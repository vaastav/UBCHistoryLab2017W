WASHINGTON , December 5 4 p. m.
The following is a partial synopsis of
the president's message : The president
congratulates the country on the pros
perity , abundant harvest , peace and
friendship with all nations. He says
the American republic , when it elect
ed ita twenty-fourth chief magistrate ,
furnished aa example -which must Im
press the world pvofoundly with the
stability of republican Institutions.
The election \olho southern states has
not been attpnded with more than the
usual manifestations of violence , but
much fvaud in the counting , returning
and canvassing of the votes has been
'practiced whereby large num
bers of colored citizens were
deprived of their franchise.
The whole country deeircs
sectionalism as a faster in our pblitt
should disappear. The loyal peon
of the country will insist that t
laws must be obeyed The par. (
mount-question is sti'l ' as to the en- !
joymenr ot tha right of every Ame I"
can citizen to freely cast his vote si c
have it honestly counted. With thii
question settled party byegones wi

pretldentrex-
i hope that congress , in ex
amining tbe credentials of members ,
will Bee to it that every violation of
1 the fifteenth amendment shall be in-
jrestigatod and that no benefit of such
"
"Violation ahall accrue to any person or
party. Ho recommends that congress
supplement the local educational funds
in the various states , by devoting for
this purpo > o the proceeds from the
Bales of public lands.
The president again calls attention
to the necessity of civil service re
form. Ths experience of the past
four years convince him that a seri
ous danger threatens the country.
from the conflict over executive pat- }
roange. Ho recommends fixed rules
for the regulation of appointments '
and removals. The experiment of
. , -competitive examinationa has In the
\ main proved satisfactory. The ser
t-ice has been materially improved by
'the assnrauco given that appoint
ments depend on merit and advance
ment is assured by fidelity A strong
crowing public sentiment demands
the strongest measures for securing
and enforcing the highest tfficiedcy in
the public service. He recommends
an appriatlon of $25,000 per annum
to a commission to supervise competi
tive exair.iuatlons throughout the ser
vice. The president reviews at
length his reasons for sustain
ing this commission , and re
commends such lofiin'-.t.ion that
while leaving every oilicor free
to express hia political opinions and
use his means for their advances shall
enable him to feel as safe as any prl-
vato citizen In his refusal to use his
salary for any political purposes. The
most ecrious impediment to civil ser
vice reform has been found by him
to lie in the spoils system as manipu
lated by members of congress. The
first atep in any thorough reform
in the civil service must be the com
plete desire of congress and the exeo
utive in th ; distribution of federal
t patronage.
The doctrine that to the victors be
long the spoils is inseparable from
federal patronage. The national con
ventions of leading parties have again
and again dccUred the true princi
ples ot government on this question.
The present system is an invsion of
ths executive functions. The con
stitution requires tlie executive
and bonds of departments to make
all nominations and the house and
senate to accuse and judge faithless
officers. The latter should not dictate
nominations. The president recom
mends that an act be passed defining
the relations of members of congress
with respect to officers' appointments
made bj the president.
POLYGAMY.
It is the recognized duty and par-
pose of tbe people of the United
States to suppress polygamy where "
cow exists in our territories and
prevent ita extension. Faithful f
alous efforts have been made
( he United States authorities in D *
to enforce the laws against it. Ex ;
rience has shown that the legula'I
noon this subject to be effective
quires extensive modification A
amendment. The longer action
delayed the more difficult it will 1
pie accomplish what < ii desired.
[ Prompt and dacided measures ' we
necessary. The Mormon lecretarfan
which upholds poloyamy
aas the whole power of making and
( executing the local legislation of the
[ territory by its control of the grand
land petit -juries"it possesses large
influence over the administration of
justice , exercising as the heads of
this sect do , tbo local political powei
of the territory , they are able t (
make effective their hostility to * thi
law of congress on the subject o
polygamy , and in fact to prevent iti
enforcement. Polygamy will not bi
abolished if the enforcement of the
law depends on those who practice in
and uphold the crime. It can onij
be suppressed by taking away th <
political power of the sect whlci
encouraged and sustains it. The
power of con/ress to enact suitable
laws to protect the territories is am
ple. It is not a csse for half-waj
measures. The political power of tht
Mormon sect is increasing ; it control !
now one of our wealthiest and most
populous territories. It ia extending
steadily Into other territories ; wher
ever it goes it establishes polygamy
and sectarian political power.
* * * * *
I recommend congress to provide
for the government of Utah by a gov
ernor and judges , or commission-
appointed by tne president and co * . -
firmed by the -senate , as governmc _ "
analagous to the provisional govern-
mcak established for- the territory of
the northwest of Ohio by the ordin
ance of 1787. If , however , ic Is
deemed best to continue the existing
'
form of 'local government , I recom
mend that the right to vote , hold
office and sit on juries in thp territory
of Utah be confined to those who
neither practice nor uphold polygamy.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Our relations with all foreign coun
tries have been those of undisturbed
peace and have presented no occasion
for concern as to their continned
maintalnance. * * * The message
then goes on to state that a communi
cation has been received from the
British government relative to the
claims for Indemnity of American
fishermen on acconnt of the Fortune
Bay outrage , renewing consideration
of the subject and showing a disposi
tion to accept the United States'
view of the subject , but in regard to
the Interpretation of the treaty and
the right of our fishermen to indem
nity , leaving the measure of such in
demnity to further conference. The
president believe * that a speedy ad
justment of the question will bo the
result. Reference Is made to the
success of American exhibitions at
the International exhibition at Sid
ney , and the message proceeds at fol
lows :
PANAMA CANAL.
Relations between this government
md the United States of Columbia
lave engaged public attention during
be past year , mainly by the projected
nter.oceanic canal across the Isthmus
if Panama. Views expressed by the
resident in a special message last
March relative to this project are
> saln ; presented for consideration ,
subsequent consideration has con-
irme'd me in the opinion that it is the
Ight and duty of the United States
o assert and maintain-such supervis-
on and , anthority over any intar-
seanic canal across the isthmus that
oanects North and South America as
rill protect our national interest.

linded both belligerents of our wil-

ODR RELATIONS Wrm BRAZIL.
The relations of the United States

e most cordial , and their commercial
iterconrse steadily increases , to their
mtnal advantage.
CLEOPATRA'S NEEDLE.
The obelisk generously presented by
ie khedive of Egypt to the city of
'ew York has safely arrived in this

letropolis. The commission for the
quidation of the Egyptian debt has
itely concluded its work , and the gov-
nment at the earnest solicitation of
ie khedive has acceded to the provis-
ns adopted by it , which w be laid
sforo congress for its information.

iligations under the metrical conven-
jn. After referring to the snccels
the United States at the Berlin
hery exhibition , the message pri-
eds. Oar friendly relations with
e German empire continue without
terruption.
NATURALIZATION.
The question is raised between the
o governments as to the proper ef-
ct and Interpretation of our treaties
naturalization.bnt recent dispatch-
from our minister at Berlin show
at favorable progress is making to-
ird an understanding , In accordance
ith the views of their government ,

tlcens abroad have never been fewer

The president again recommanda c
i the payment of the remainder of th
Japanese and China indemnity-fon :
to these governments.
. " MEXICO.
In my last annual message I ea
pressed the hope that the peace o
the border between
this country an
Mexico would soon become so asinre
as to justify a modification of the 01
ders there in force to our mllitar
commanders In .regard to leaving th
frontier without encouraging ' sue
disturbances as would endanger th
peace of the two countries. Event
moved iffaccordence with these ei
psctations , and ordeta were accord
'ugly withdrawn to the entire satis
faction of our own citizens and thi
Mexican government. Subsequent !
the peace of the border was agaii
disturbed by a savage foray under th
command of Chief Tictoria , but b ;
the combined and harmonious actioi
of themilitary forces of both coun
tries his band has been broken up am
substantially destroyed. There i
reason to'believe that the obstacle
which have so long prevented rapic
and convenient communication between
twoen the United'Statt&fend Mexict
by railways are on the point of dlsap
pearing , and that several importan
enterprises of th'a character will bf
set on foot which cannot fail to con
tribute largely to the prosperity o :
both countries.
PREVENTION OF EPIDEMICS.
In pursuance of an act passed a <
the last session of congress invitation :
have been extended foreign maritime
states to join in a sanitary conference
in Washington beginning the 1st
of January. The acceptance of this
invitation by many prominent powers
give promise of snocess in this import
ant mbature , designed to establish a
system ot international notification
by which the spread of Infections or
epidemic diseases may be more effect
ively checked or prevented.
CONSULAR BEPOETS.
The president asks congre s to make
necessary appropriations for the con
sular service , to enlarge the trade and
commerce of the United States with
foreign nations. He calls attention to
the material advantages derived from
consular reports by American manu
facturers , j t
"
A PROSPEROUS NATION.
The condition of the financial affairs
of the government is very satisfactory.
It is believed that the present finan
cial situation in the United States ,
whether considered with respect to
trade , currency , credit , growing
wealth , or extent and variety * of our
resources , Is more favorable than that
of' any other country of our time , and
tias never been surpassed by that of
any country at any period of its his
tory. All our industries are thriving ,
rate of interest is lownew railroads are
being constructed , vast immigration is
increasing our population , capital and
labor , new enterprises In great num
ber are in progress , and our | commer
cial relations with other countries are
improving.
BETUHDINO.
.Within a short period over $600,000
5 and 6 per cent bonds will become
redeemable. This presents a very fa-
rorable opportunity not only to fnr-
her reduce the principal of the debt ,
jat.also reduce the rate of Interest on
-hat\which will remain unpaid. The
President calla the attention of con
gress to the views expressed on the
mbject by Secretary Sherman in his
innual reporI , and recommends prompt
cgislation to enable the treasury de
partment to complete refunding the
lebt , which is about to mature.
RESUMPTION.
The continuance of specie pay-
nents has not been interrupted or en-
langered since the date of resump-
ion. It has contributed greatly to
he revival of business and to our re-
narkable prosperity. Fears that pre-
oded and accompanied resumption
lave proved groundless. No consid-
rable amount of United State aotea
lave been presented for redemption ,
rhile very large sums of gold bullion ,
loth domestic and imported , are taken
0 the mints and exchanged for coin
r notes. The Increase of coin and
mllion in the United States since
anuary 1,1877,1s estimated at § 227-
39,428.
OREEBBACES ,
There are still In existence , un-
inceled , $346,681,010 United States
jjjal tender notes. These notes were
uthorized as a war measure , made
ecessary by the exigencies of the
onflict in which the United States
ras than engaged. The pretervatlon
f the nation's existence required , in
ie judgment of congress , the issue
f legal tender p per money. That it
jrved well the purpose for which It
'as created is not questioned , but the
mployment of notes aa piper money
ideBnitolv , after the accomplishment
f the object for which they were pro-
ided , was not contemplated by the
amers of the l w under which they
ere issued. These notes long since
Biame , like any other pecuniary obli
vion of the government , a debt to
e paid , and when paid to be canceled
1 mere evidence of indebtedness no
mger exiiting. I therefore repeat
hat was said in my nnnual message
[ laat year , that retirement ftom cir.
iktion of United States notes , jfith
ie capacity of lag-si tender in private
mtracts , is a step to bo taken in our
regress towards safe and stable cur-
ircy , which should , be accepted as
ie policy and duty * of the govern-
ent and the interest and security
: the people. 4
TUB DOLLARS OF OUR DADS.
At the * time of , thp passage of the
: t now in force requiring the coinage
I stiver dollars , fixing their value
id giving them a legal tender charter -
: ter , it was believed by many sup-
> rters of the measure that the silver.
) llar which it authorized would
ieedily become , under the opera-
ans of the law , of equivalent value
> the gold dollar. Under the act re-
rred to the coinage of standard sil-
; r dollars began In March , 1878 , and
is been continued as required by the
: t. The average rate per month to
e present time has been $2,276,492 ;
tnl amount coined prior to the -1st
November last was $2,847,750 ; of
is amount $47,034,450 remains in
ie treasury , and only $25,763,191
e in the hands of the people. Con-
ant effort has been made to keep
tis currency in circulation , and con-
ierablo expense has been necessarily
curred for this purpose , but its re-
rn to the treasury is prompt and
ire , contrary to the confident antic- !
itions of the friends"of the measure ,
t the time of its adoption ihe.value
the silver dollar containing 412 $
aina of silver has not increased ,
uring the year prior to the passage
the bill authorizing ita coinage tbe
market value of the silver which i
contained was from 90 to 92 cona
compared with the utandard DlJ d'il
lar. During the last yeir tha avc' i
market value of the silver d Har La
been 88 $ cents. It naa obvious s.

produced the offe3t then jr dictct

danger that this country will b
forced to accept single metal ard ' ]
for legal standard Value , in epecrh-
tion , and this a standard of Ha value
than it purports to bo worth in
recognized money of the world. TLc
constitution of the United Sila' ! '
sound financial principles , and ovi
best interests , all require t at thj
country should have as ita legil * ender -
der money , both gold and aiivor co i
of intrinsic value as bullion , cq.i'vt > -
lent to that which , npon its f t i
purports topossess the conatitutrn Ir
express terms , recognises both fi > 1
and silver as the only true Ugl tea-
der money. To banish eith rif tht 30
metals from onr cnmncy is to'narron
and limit the circulating medium of
exchange to disparagement of nut oi *
ant interests. The United Stit *
produces more silver than auj n I r
country , and Is directly iutercs * i
maintaining it as one of two piv. -
metals which furnish the con ? < f
the world. It will , in my judgmr-t ,
contribute to this result if conf 5
will repeal so much of the eii-f
legislation as requires the cningi of
a silver dollar containing only 412A
grains of silver , and in its atoacl n U
authorize the secretary of the treasury
tojfeoin silver dollars of equivalcpr
value as bullion with cold < .n 1 irs.
This/will defraud nc man , and w > ll o
m accordance with familiar p c > >
dents. Congress , on seveinl ncca
< ? : ons , has altered the ratio of valu $
between gold and silver , in order t
establish it more nearly in ac-virdauo-
with the actual ratio of value batcrr < i
the two metals. In financial legisla

NEW YOEE , December 6 4 p. m.
i. special cablegram says that it is an-
tonnced in London that if Farnell
saves Dublin during the course of the
ind league trial , he will be immedi-
tely arrested. It is understood In
jondon that Parnell and all the other
lembers of parliament who are In-
toted with him , will attempt to go
o London and exercise their leglsla-
ive right. These state trials , saya a
jondon journal , recall the prosecu-
ion of O'Connell In 1844 for con-
piracy , but It seems that we are
eaa liberal in our construction
if law now than we
yero then , as O'Connell was permit-
ed to go from Dublin to London and
aako his very best speech In the
louse of commons in his own behalf
rhtle under conviction , which was
ifterwarda set aside by a majority of
he. low lords. While the present
igitation ia confined to the narrow
Imits of one city , the five Irish mem-
ters who are under indictment com-
iriEe the brains of the Irish party in
he house of commons , and with
hem out of the way it would be plain
ailing for almost any land bill that
lay be introduced.

gitatora. The same were brought

ourse of the agitators , in deny-
ig the postponement of the trials ,
[ is remarks are generally regarded
3 extraordinary and extremely
srtizin and indicate that the speech
'e j intended more for its bearing up-
n the country than for ita effect aa a
idicial decision. The attorney gen-
ral says that the trial pill not proba-
ly cocinme more than one week un-
i 3 tbe indicted parties interpose
ivolous objections and mo'ions in-
Hided to produce a delay ; . He added
iat if Farnell's plea for a postpone-
lent be admitted , Parnell would be
laced In a position in which he could
elay the trial indefinitely.
