-It is the entering of a new field of furniture building, tak
ing ancient substantiability as its keynote. You'll like this
United Craft furniture. It appeals to the aesthetic-it is full
of suggestion for the artistic-it allows of a perfect harmony
of tone between the wood and leather of the furniture and
the tints of the rest of the room-the shades of brown and
gray achieving first prominence-soft, restful, satisfying.
-We are making a special display of this "character" fur
niture in our windows and on the floors. The "tavern suite"
is characteristic of this art of furniture building. Primitive in
design-substantially constructed-built with broad iron braces
to hold the back slats-wedges instead of screws and bolts. We
tell only enough to interest you. Seeing will tell you more.
Wicker, Willow, African Fiber and
Prairie Grass Furniture.
It's holiday furniture-seems to sug
gest the gift idea-you know of its be
ing acceptable wherever it's to be used.
It's pretty, too, with a different sort of
prettiness from any of the other kinds
of furniture.
There's a room for its display since
we completed the new addition to our
building. We can show more and show
it as we want to show it.

OFCIALS IN CONErERENCE
IWROVEMENT o 14TH STREET
UNDER DISCUSSION.
Aetten of Comissieers in With
heldIag Approval of Awards Ox
plaimed-Appreval' Expressed.
The District Commissioners have had an
informal conference with Senator Mouiln
chairman of the District Senate committee.
and Representative J. W. Babcock, who, it
is generally understood, will again be chair
man of the District committee in the House,
with regard to the verdict of the jury of
condemnation in the widening and exten
sion of 16th street. The Commissioners
stated to these gentlemen that they had
withheld their approval of the verdict until
they could place the matter before the
committees of Congress, because of the fact
that the award of damages amounted to
$785,245.87, while the benefits assessed were
but a little over $100,000, or about one-sev
enth the amount of damages.
The low under which the extension of
16th street was ordered prescribes that If
the benefits assessed are not equal to 50 per
cent of the damages awarded the Commis
sioners could, at their discretion, decline
to approve the verdict. In the case of 16th
street the Commissioners stated that the
award of damages and the assessment of
benefits were at such wide variance with
the rule prescribed by Congress that they
did not feel justified in approving the ver
dict, and so had filed their exceptions in
court to hold the matter in statu quo until
Congresp convened.
Commissioner Macfarland stated that the
Commissioners regarded the provision of
the law giving them power to withhold ap
proval in certain contingencies as indicat
ing the wishes of Congress on the subject
and had hesitated to take contrary action.
* Their Course Approved.
Senator McMillan and Representative
Babcock both assured Mr. Macfarland that
they believed the Commissioners had pur
sued a wise course and had done what Con
gress had intended they should do in such
a case. They further stated that they would
take the matter up informally with the
members of the respective District commit
tees and discuss it. Commissioner Macfar
land urged that whatever was to be done
should be done quickly, as the citizens were
urging the matter upon the Commissioners
very diligently.
Mr. Macfarland went over the whole sub
ject of the 16th street extension and ex
plained to the chairmen of the committees
just why the verdict of the jury had been
so seemingly out of all proportion compared
to other thoroughfare condemnations. He
recited the expressions of the citizens as
made at the public hearing granted by the
Commissioners to all interested during last
June. At that time it was stated that the
assessment of benefits was small because of
the fact there was but little land eligible
for assessments. Along a greater portion
of the thoroughfare the streets running
parallel thereto had already been opened
and improved, and therefore the sphere of
benefit had been very considerably lessened.
It was also stated that a great deal of
the land had been dedicated outright to the
District, and furthermore that the needs of
the land at the upper end of the street did
not call for a street of the width of 160
feet as prescribed for 16th street.
Matter of Expense.
At the hearing it was further urged that
the extension of 16th street was proposed
in large degree for the purpose of estab
lishing a national boulevard and drive to
Rock Creek Park, and the cost of the ex
tension should therefore be defrayed by
the national government, instead of being
wholly saddled onto the District of Colum
bia.
As a result of the conference today it
was arranged that at an early date the Dis
trict Commissioners should appear before
the District committees of the Senate and
House and present the matter formally.
It is furthermore expected that the citizens
interested may desire to be present for the
purpose of urging Congress to grant the
Commissioners permission to approve the
verdict. The citizens believe that a better
verdict cannot be obtained. They say a
competent jury of prominent business men
spent several months in taking testimony
and Inquiring into the value of the land
affected by the extension, and had given
their best judgment in the matter.
DEATHS FROM GRIP.
Unusually Early Appearance of the
Disease In Serious Form.
In the weekly statement of deaths and
health conditions in the District issued from
the health office today no less than three
deaths during the seven days covered by
the report are attributed to grip, the disease
which annually wreaks much havoc in all
American cities since its introduction into
this country several years ago.
The appearance of grip in fatal form this
early in the winter is entirely unusual for
Washington, and it Is stated at the health
office that generally the first death from
the disease to occur is reported In January.
It will be impossible to tell to just what
extent the disease has taken hold of the
capital until the report for the current week
is made up. The changeable weather for
several weeks past brought about a preva
lence of bad colds and in a great many in
stances grip has followed. The health au
thorities declare that the early appearance
of the disease should result In every one
taking all possible precautions against it.
The deaths in the District during the
week ended on Saturday last numbered 106,
as agaInst 107 in the corresponding week of
last year, and 105 in the week previous. Of
the decedents 55 wvere white, representing
a death rate of 14.8 per thousand, and 51
colored, death rate 30.8. For all the deaths
the rate was 19.8 per thousand of all the
population. From affections of the brain
there was an increase in the mortality as
compared with the previous week from 9 to
15; of heart diseases, from 5 to 9, and kid
ney ailments, from 5 to 8. There was a de
crease in deaths from consumption from 17
to 14, and those among children under five
years old, from 28 to 19, and among those
under one year of age, from 18 to 22. There
was one fatal case of typhoid fever, 8 of
diphtheria and 8 from grip. There were
2 deaths from violence, 1 being a case of
suicide by drowning and 1 accIdental inha
lation of illuminating gas.
At the close of the last report there were
88 cases of diphtheria in quarantine in 28
premises. During the week 9 new cases oc
curred and 15 were discharged, leaving 27
cases under treatment in 21 premises.
Of scarlet fever there were 57-eases in
quarantine in 87 premises at the close of
last report. During the week 11 new cases
were reported and 6 were discharged, leav
ing 62 cases, with warning cards in 48
The mean weather conditions prevalent
during the week were: Temperature of the
atmosphere, 87 degrees; relati've humidity,
6B, and barotheter, 23.90. There was a rain
fall of 1.18 inches, with northwlesterly winds
averaging 11 mIles per hour. The maximum
of the thermometer was 54 degrees on the
24th, and minImunm, 23 degrees on the 28th.

NAX EIRSTOW*jg L., December 4.-The
court faming ta uunain the demurrer to
the first count l-the indictment against
Election Supervls a Charles B. South and
Thomas A. Nock Or non-feasance in office.
tha case eame to.Arial here yesterday be
fore Chief Judge A.-Hunter Boyd and Asso
ciate Judge, Edwar Stake. Judge- Boyd,
in delivering the opinion, said the allega
tions -set :out In the first count of the in
dictment. charging that the word republi
can ha$ been, substituted for the word pro
hibition after the:name. of the prohibition
candidate for conroller, were - sufficient to
require the travemers to answer, but
whether they were willfully negligent as
election supervisors was a matter to be de
termined. by the testimony and the facts
as brought out.
In his opeiing statement State's Attorney
Poffenberger briefly reviewed the finding
on election day of a-large number of official
ballots with the word republican instead of
of the word prohibition after. the name of
the prohib)tlon candidate for controller.
For the defense City Attorney J. Augus
tine Mason, one of the counsel, claimed the
supervisors had taken every care and pains
to perform their duties faithfully, and that
the misprinting of a portion of the ballots
was the result of an error of the printer
and could not be charged to the supervi
sors.
Elias B. Hartle, clerk to the election su
pervisors, and Supervisor Brown were the
two most important witnesses for the
state. After telling. how several motions
of Mr. Brown, relative to the printing of
the ballots, had been tabled, Mr. Hartle
said President South delegated him to at
tend to the printing. Clerk Hartle said
the proof of the ballot submitted to him was
correct and that he was positive the word
prohibition was opposite the name of the
prohibition candidate for oontjroller.
.r. Brown told how his motion that a
proof of the ballot be submitted to the
board was tabled, as was also his mouion
that two supervisors-one republican and
one democrat-watdh the printing of the
ballots. He said he was not allowed to see
a proof of the ballot and was not allowed
to see any of the ballots after they were
printed until they were delivered to the
board. He testified that he called at the
printing office to see what progress was
being made, but the manager of the print
ing establishment refused him admission to
that portion of the plant where the tiskets
were being printed.
Ex-Mayor M. L. Keedy, S. M. Strite.
Charles C. Fechtig, sr., and others testified
to voting misprinted ballots, two stating
they voted them knowingly. Charles Al
vey, attorney for the board, was also a
witness.
James T. Briscoe, Jr., printer of the
official ballots, testified that he carried
out the requiremqpts of the law and of
the oath which he, took; that he used every
precaution to protect the ballots, but that
they were printed -on two forms, and the
error occurred lu the second form, a proof
of which was nqt-shown to Clerk Hartle.
Supervisors 89uth and Nock testified in
their own behalf, claiming they performed
their duties honestly and to the best of
their ability; thtbtheM reading of the proof
of the ballot was left-to Clerk Hartle. Both
stated that they, felt they had exercised
every precaution to have the ballots prop
erly printed.
At the conclusion o4 the argument, which
lasted nearly four hours, Judge Boyd an
nounced that the case would be held un
der consideration, until Saturday morning.
The case has at;acted much Attention In
a'estern, -Mfaryland and much interest Is
manifested in the outcome.

The members of the Columbia Heights
Citizens' Association, In monthly meeting
last evening at The Savoy, expressed them
selves in emphatic manner against the erec
tion of unsightly telephone and telegraph
poles In that residential section. The sub
ject was discussed at some length. Finally
the association unanimously denounced "the
policy that has In view the wholesale eree
tion of poles." The resolution urged that
underground conduits for all wires be laid
as speedily as possible. The secretary was
instructed to communicate with the Dis
trict Commissioners on the subject.
During the discussion of the pole question
Secretary Todd explained that some time
ago, In order to secure police and fire pro
tection, the association had agreed that it
would not then object to the erection of a
few poles. Mr. Bundy took the floor to say
that the time had arrived when all wires
between Florida avenue and Spring road
should be underground. More than a year
agi the president of the telephone company
had assured the speaker that within a year
from that time a conduit would be in place
along 15th street. "The year has elapsed."
said Mr. Bundy. "and that promise ought
to be redeemed."
The meeting was called to order by Vice
President C. S. Bundy, in the absence of
President Hart, who is ill. Secretary W.
B. Todd made a record of the proceedings.
John H. Gause was elected to membership.
C. M. Campbell, chairman of the special
committee of five, appointed at the last
meeting, for the purpose of gathering data
relative to the advantages of Columbia
Heights as a residential section. announced
that his report would be forthcoming at
the next meeting. Notice was given by Dr.
B. F. Gibbs that at the next meeting he
would offer a resolution indorsing the proj
ect of holding medical inspections in the
prblic schools.
Playgrounds for Children.
After a discussion participated in by Dr.
J. P. Miller, Dr. Gibbs, Mr. Campbell, Mr.
Bundy and others. a resolution was adopted
indorsing the recommendation of Major
Sylvester, superintendent of police. in his
annual report, that playgrounds for chil
dren be established throughout the city.
The association suggested as a site for one
of these playgrounds the section lying
along Piney branch in the vicinity of 14th
street.
Mr. Bundy was appointed a special com
mittee to visit the District Commissioners
and present a resolution urging that gran
olithic sidewalks be laid, under the assess
ment system, along 14th street from Flori
da avenue to Park street.
The association adopted a resolution rec
ommending that School street be extended
south to Columbia road. Incidentally, Dr.
Miller was appointed chairman of the as
sociatidn's committee on streets.
Mr. Campbell called attention to the re
ported deficit in the revenues of the Dis
trict of Columbia and suggested an inquiry
as to why large local corporations, such as
the street railways, should not be required
to contribute their proper share toward
defraying the expenses of the District. A
committee to investigate the matter, con
sisting of Messrs. Campbell, Gibbs and
Lewis Stabler, was appointed and the meet
ing adjourned.
COMMENT ON THE MESSAGE.
Editors Applaud and Criticise the
Document.
The message which President Roosevelt
transmitted to Congress yesterday is dis
cussed in all American and in many for
eign newspapers issued today. The literary
style of the message is universally com
mended. There is a difference of opinion
concerning the President's logic and his
sense of proportion, it being the judgment
of some editors that some subjects were
treated too fully and others too briefly. So
far, the message would appear to have es
caped fierce assault. The radical anti-trust
newspapers complain that the President
has dealt too temperately with that impor
tant subject. Some of those papers which
would carry to fruition the opinions of Wil
liam McKinley on the tariff and interna
tionel trade fear that Mr. Roosevelt was
not sufficiently vigorous in his presentation
of the reciprocity question. His recommen
dations concerning immigration, anarchy
and the army and navy are Indorsed with
but occasional dissent.
The New York Tribune says: "It Is not
a negative message, but bristles with rec
ommendations of a positive and far-reach
ing character, which nevertheless are es
sentially conservative in the true sense of
that often misapplied word."
In the opinion of the New York Herald
the President "draweth out the thread of
his verbosity finer than the staple of his
argument, and, while he make. a few di
rect recommendations, It is in the main a
'let well enough alone' document."
According to the New York Times "Presi
dent Roosevelt has not only communicated
to Congress and the country much infor
mation about public business, but he has
done It with a directness and vigor of ex
pression that make the reading of his mes
sage not a labor but a pleasure."
The New York Journal declares that "'the
message is packed with meat."
"The President's program is of the first
magnitude," says the Philadelphia Press,
and "is courageously expressed, brilliantly
phrased -and earnestly presented,"
The Philadelphia Inquirer says: "It is
not exactly the kind of message that it was
natural to expect from a man of Mr. Roose
velt's temperament, but perhaps it is none
the worse for that."
The Philadelphia Times thus delivers its
opinion: "President Roosevelt's first an
nual message is the most unconventional,
the most individual, that we have had since
some of the mesages of President Cleve
land."
"The message is thoroughly American," is
the oomment of the Philadelphia Ledger.
The Philadelphia North- American con
ceives that "It is the message of a man
who means to be the directing head of the
government, not a puvyropa fr
politicians." uvyro a o
The Philadelphia Record says that the
message is able, but diffuse.
