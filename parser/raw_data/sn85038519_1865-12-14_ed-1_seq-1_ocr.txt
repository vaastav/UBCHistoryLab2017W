From theRichmond Times.
The profound anxictv of our readers will
be relieved this mornins by the appearance
of the me&WKe of I resident Andrew John
son. Its penml will show that the popular
estimate ol ma patriotic hrmncss was not
erroneous, and tliat the exalted office which
he holds has elevated him high above the
clamor and menaces of faction.
To the South the firm, decided opinions of
the .President upon tins subicct will bnn
unspeakable joy. As the Commandcr-in-
Unci ot tne army and navy, he can, at any
moment, remove the military, and, as the
President of the United States, he can, by
tlie exercise ot tlio veto power, prevent the
consummation of all Kadical Fchcmes for
garrisoning the South. He is completely
master of the position, and although a Rad
ical Contrress mav exclude our representa
tives, thev cannot make u the victims of
unjust and oppressivo legislation.
In the frank, manlv announcement of
the President that he has taken ovcry
necessary step to restore the constitutional
relxtions of the Southern States, and de
sires them to resume their places in both
branches of the National Legislature, and
thereby complete the work of restoration.
as soon as they have adopted " the constitu
tional amendment abolishing slavery," he
mates a lair, bold issue with 'Joncress.
Profoundly interested as the people of the
South arc in that portion of the President's
message which we have considered, wc shall
not pretend to discuss any other portion of
it at this time. Wc rise from the perusal
of this message almost overcome with emo
tions of thankfulness to God, that between
our defeated section and the howling pas
sions of a Kadical Congress there is inter
posed the granite will of Andrew Johnson
The President having officially announced
the single condition for our rcadmission
which he demands of the Soiuh, it becomes
our imperative duty to strengthen his position
by 1 proi"Mt acquiescence in his wishes.
From tho Aujusta (Qa.; Constitutionalist.
Its tone is thorough and conservative; its
proiiositions sharply defined ; its reasoning
mamlv correct, isoonc, however obtuse, can
fail to discover a veneration for the Consti
tution vcining through its everv ramifica
tion, like golden streaks in a porphyry tab
let. Upon that august instrument the Presi
dent fixes his faith and draws his inspiration.
Through it he makes a revelation of national
life, and summons all to worship at the same
shrine the tabernacle of true Eepublican
principle. It must be kept in mind, how
ever, that though the power of the President
is vast, it is not omnipotent, and though his
words be as eloquent as tho-c of Chrysoitom,
they may fall upon listeners more heedless
than granite lions on a city gate. How glad-
would wc ol tiie bouth welcome a return
to the mild interprctings of the Constitution;
how poignantly have wc beheld it trampled
upon anil spat at. That glorious compact
has suflercd pollution at the hands of fanat
ics ; we applaud the President's appeal for
its restoration to the Ark of Covenant.
At present, wc can bestow but a superficial
glance at the different theories. Wc counsel
an attentive perusal by all our people and
commend to them and to our lawgivers
these remarkable words : " So long as the
Constitution of the United States endures.
the States will endure ; the destruction of
the one is the destruction of the other ; the
preservation of the one is the preservation of
the other."
From the Coluinbus (fla.,) Snn.
Tho long expected and anxiously looked
for message may be seen in full by reference
to our fourth page. It is ono of the ablest
state papers that has been given to the coun
try for the past twenty years, and carries the
m ind back to the days of Madison and Jeffer
son. Hie paper snows that its illustrious
author is a thorough expounder of the Con
stitution, that he has carefully and pro
foundly investigated it in all hearings upon
the vital questions of the day, thereby show
ing very decidedly that, according to the
Constitution, a State may for a while, sus
pend its function., but not entirely destroy
them, or dissolve State relations from tho
several States.
From tho Memphis Commercial.
e have read ttie Presidents message
with great care and attention, and we regard
its whole tenor and spirit as highly favorable
to an early admission of the Representatives
of the Southern States to their scats in Con
gress. Hie only measure remaining ior con
summation, and which is deemed necessary
a3 a farther pledge for the security of peace
and union, is the adoption of the Constitu
tional amendment by each of the Southern
States. On this point the Preiident says :
"The adoption of the amendment reunites
us beyond all power of disruption. It heals
the wound that is still imperfectly closed ; it
removes slavery, the clement which has long
divided the countrj-; it makes of us once
more a united people, renewed and strength
ened, bound more than ever to mutual aflcc
tion and support."
" Tho amendment to the Constitution be
ing adopted, it would rcnutin for the State,
iriosc powers have been so lony in abeyanee, to
resume their places in the luv branches of the
National Legislature, and tttercby complete the
work of restoration."
"Here it is for you, fellow-citizens of tho
Senate, and for you, fellow-citizens of the
House of Representatives, to judge, each of
you for yourselves, of the olections, returns
anil qualifications of your own members."
This language is clear and cannot be mis
taken. The President declares, in emphatic
terms, that "the work of restoration" is com
plete upon the adoption of the Constitu
tional amendment. It is true he says that
the Senate and Houso must judge each for
themselves of the "elections, returns, and
qualifications" of their own members, not
of the right of those States to representa
tion, but of the clcctions, returns, and quali
fications. The Constitution hxs made each
House the Judge, in these cases, and it was
all Mr. Johnson could do. But as to the
question of restoration, so far as the Presi
dent can determine it, there is left no doubt
of the President's decision.
From the Memphis Argus.
The President's message will not prove
acceptable to the Northern radicals. They
may commend it in general terms now, but
will soon declare against it. It is not vin
dictive toward the South, and for that, if no
other objection were precntcd, it will incur
their displeasure.
The points in which we of the South are
more directly interested just now arc " res
toration " wc will not say " reconstruction "
and "negro suffrage." Many feared that
the radical pressure upon the President
would prove too formidable for resistance
and compel a change of views. That fear
has been difripatcd by the message, in which
the principles so often enunciated by the
President arc not only reiterated, but
strengthened by the strongest arpimcnts.
His policy was then, intended for no ex
periment, but a finality, unless Congress de
termined otherwise.
The President has kept his word with our
people, who, instead of decoming disheart
ened, have every reason to be hopefuj for
the future. It fs certain that the President
will spare no effort to cnure the prompt
restoration of the Southern States to their old
position of equality in the Union.
Frum the Mobilo Rtfritcr and Advertiser.
Since the installation of the first President
of the United States there have never existed
such elements to invoke and to inspire a
great State paper m those which surrounded
Sir. Johnson when he penned the message
Ixtbre us. The occasion and the theinr were
alike grand in the interest and result. The
auditory wan the civilized world the ques
tion, the right as well as the capability of
mankind for self-fTOvernracnt. Of the mere
mnnncr of the message, it is unfair to judge,
for doubtless, the style and text have been
mutilated w"n the proverbial inaccuracy of
fnlcffTanhic transmission. But no verbial
defects have been sufficient to hide from us
the spirit and body of the document. Alter
thanking God for the end of war, and pay
ing a tribute to the memory of hi predeces
sor, Mr. Johnson launches his argument into
the marrow of the great question of tho day.
He halts not to talk of Governmental details,
or to adorn hin speech with "glittering
generalities." What waa to be done with
tho States latelv in rebellion, their arras be
ing stacked and surrendered ? This is th c
question, and the topic, and in its
discussion ho prefaces lib own pro
gramme by a searching analysia
bf the theory of the Federal Constitution
and Government that theory of courw,
tempered by the heat evolved from a sue
cessful war against tho extreme State
Rights principle. Hb passes from this
analvsis to a vindication of the principles
of Republican freedom. lie takes Ins stand
on the side of the Constitution. He de
clares for peace, harmony and specdv resto
ration, and paints both the impohev and
the savagerv of the alternative theory of
dividing the nation between vanquishers
and vanquished, and the great perils and
exhausting expense of a martial govern
ment for the South. In a word, the Presi
dent adheres to and maintains the pro
gramme of reconstruction with which hi;
speeches and declarations have made tho
country familiar, and which has caused the
South to regard him m a great benefactor
and a wise statesman. io matter that he
has not done this with an elan and a spirit of
defiance that would have kept pace with
the ardor of our desires and our sense of
right. No matter if the President has for
gotten the prime rule of pugilism, which is
to get the first blow and make it a telling
one, in all great encounters, lie has done
enough to plant himself souarclv and fair
ly in antagonism to the radical programme
which tramples constitution, freedom and
humanity under the feet of a cruel and in
exorable partyism.
From tho N. 0. Picayune.
The assertion of the principle that the
fatates are indestructible parts of tho Union,
under the Constitution, forever, is the bul
wark which the President interposes in ad
vance against the efforts with which he is
threatened to be crossed in his policy by a
Kadical Longress, to reduce to tne condition
of alien territories, won in war, States which
the President believes to be indispensablo
parts of the system, with functions only tem
porarily suspended.
Here is antagonism in doctrine between
President Johnson and the Radicals of tho
Republican party. If wc were discussing
the points of difference between them, and
their practical application to present and
coining events, with any hope of influencing
uction in favor of liberal dealing with the
Southern States as the only constitutional, as
well as the wise and magnanimous course, a
great deal might be urged in support of the
President s views ; and something gratetullv,
in extenuation of his enforced departure, in
material parts of his restoration policy,
from his own expressed convictions. But
the Southern people are without voice in,
the public councils wherein their fate is agi
tated, and powerless, bv argument or per
suasion, to lnlluence the decisions, llicy
must accept what is decreed for them, and
only provoke indignity by argument and re
monstrance. The language of the President teems to
imply that he has acceded to the -condition
that the Southern Legislature must ratify the
constitutional amendment respecting slavery
before their representatives can be admitted
into Congress on equal ternu with the loval
States. The requisition is made hesitatingly,
but the meaning is clear. The value of the
amendment is urged with great warmth as a
pledge of sincerity in the return to the Union,
and of perpetual loyalty and peace an as
surance of oblivion of all past memories,
and a balm for the healing of all wounds.
Delay will only be a source of uncertainty
and jealousy. The appeasing of these hos
tile passions by ratifying the amendment, is
put forward prominently by the President as
1 means of facilitating the restoration ot the
States. It is only said by implication that it
s a positive condition to be enforced.

City of "Wasiiingtox, Nov. 30, 1SC3.
To tho Editor of the New York Times:
There arc so many erroneous statements in
relation to the condition of affairs in North
Carolina and other Southern States that in
the hope of being able to correct them to
some extent, I send you a communication.
The extended circulation your paper has in
the North would enable a great number of
persons to sco a statement as candid and fair
as I am able to make it. It is of the utmost
conwcqucncc that the Government of the
United States should act wii-clv toward the
States lately at war with it. It claimed the
ight to protect itell and to exert its twwers
until its safety and repose were secured.
"When these vital ends have been attained.
its action with respect to its enemies should
ic modified by its views as to their
moral guilt. It sometimes happens that
the highest political offences arc regarded
as involving little or no moral guilt what
ever. No citizen of the United States per
haps regards Sir William Wallace as a crim
inal, though he was actually executed for
treason committed in an attempt to liberate
his country from tho dominion of England,
whose armies had subdued it. Few persons
look ujion 1110 Irsh patriot Kmmctt as guilty
of moral crime, though he died as a traitor
for attempting to free Ireland from the Brit
tish domination to which it had been sub
jected for centuries. A case still more re
cent, and better known, is that of Lmt
Kossuth. lie was undoubtedly guilty of
treason in attempting a revolution in Hun
gary which had for ages formed a part of
the Austrian limpire, yet he was not mil v not
regarded as a criminal here, but on the con
trary, was treated with the highest consider
ation by our government and people. Such
cases as these arc referred to to illustrate and
sustain the position that the highest political
ollcncc may have been con unit ted without
involving serious moral guilt In the opinion
of civilized nations. Hence Christian gov
ernments cease to act against snch offenders
when assured that they have nothing to ap
prehend from them.
The late civil war was not produced by a
maiority of the people cither of the North
or the.South, but by minorities of both, who
were looked upon, however, by the opposite
section in each case as representing majori
ties. This minority at the North consisted
of men who said, in the first place, that the
Southern States could not be " driven out of
the Union." Secondly, that if they did at
tempt to go out, they were so feeble that they
could be crushed in a few weeks. Thirdly,
that the slaves would, in tho beginning of
the struggle, rise in general insurrection and
waste the Southern States. Fourthly, it was
said that thcscStatcudid not produce enough
to subsist on without the aid of the North,
and by a blockade alone could be reduced to
submission. Lastly, it was said that the
United States would have the moral support
of the civilized world in any contest, and, if
necessary material aid.
In the couth was to Iks found the counter
part of this party. They existed chiefly in
the Cotton States, but did not constitute a
maiority of the people there. These men
said that the people of the North, though
they loved the Union for iti advantage?: and
pecuniary profit", would not fight for it, and
that secession would be " peaceable." Sec
ondly, they affirmed that "cotton was king;',
that foreign nations could not do without it,
and that even if war did occur, the great
Pfiwcrs of huropc wouid interfere to arrest
it. Thcso parties, though minorities, seemed
to represent the two section, and being
equally unreasonable, active, arrogant and
insolent, they strengthened oach other by
their several demonstrations. The first year
of the war, however, destroyed utterly the
idea upon which these two parties were
based. Tluj Northern extremist saw, in
tho first place, that the Southern States
could not only lie driven out of the Union,
but vc-re willing to leave it, on grounds
which niot men in the North thought
Blender and insufficient. Secondly, that when
they did secede, the Southern people made
n determined and olwtinatc resistance.
Thirdly, that the negroes, instead of rising
lo claim their freedom, were so docile, and
contributed so much by their labor, that
:hey were seen to constitute an element of
great strength to the section in which they
lived, fourthly, that the ."southern Mate
produced in great abundance all the pro
visions necessary to their subsistence And
lastly, it wa-i seen that foreign Powers at
least divided their moral support between
the contending parties.
Tne Southern extremists were soon con
vinced that the people of the North would
not only fight for the Union, but that they
would carry on the war with extraordinary
vigor and upon a most extendi Fcale. Se
condly, they saw that cotton so far from be
ing li King," could not bring a single sol
dier into the field, and that foreigner",
though willing to make the best bargains
possible for themselves, had no inclination
to be involved in the contest. ?g
It mut le obvious to every fair mind
that if these things had been previously
understood the war never would have oc
curred. 3he men of tertsp and principle in
t. ii .1.1 1 . .Imltul ,1a n-
tion, and no occasion would have been fur-
Dished for a ecrious collision.
To explain, however, the condition of af
tairs now existing in my own State, I will
make a brief statement of certain events that
preceded the commencement of the war. To
decide what weight should bo given to the
opinions of an individual, wo usually wish
to know what have been his opportunities! of
learning the truthrand also in what.tattw or
position he has acquired his knowledgcd.
With this object, my own course, as well a
that of North Carolina, will be adverted
to.
Though on sectional questions (such, I
mean, as had reference to slavery,)l usually
acted with the Southern Representatives";
yet, on several occasions, I was, by my
senscof duty, thrown into collision with the
extreme men of the South. For example,
I opposed the twenty-first rule, forbidding
the reception of petition, because 1 believed
it of no advantage to us, and that, by in
creasing tlic irritation between the sections,
it was strengthening the Abolitionist.
Though I opposed the so-called compromise
measures of 1800, and in public speeches ex
pressed the opinion that the adoption would,
in a few years, endanger the existence of the
government, yet, in view of the manner in
which they had been passed, I advised the
people of the South to acquiesce in them, and
endeavor to accommodate themselves to the
situation. To sustain that view, I succes
sively supported tho elections of Pierce and
Bucllanan. As tho estrangement between
the two sections increased, and
the extreme men on each side
were more violent, it became more
and more ditticult to pursue a con
servative course, and, at the same time, re
tain a capacity for usefulness as a public man.
x voicu, in 1000, ior inc jvansad uin, which
then passed the House without repealing the
Missouri restriction, in opposition to most of
the Southern Representatives. At the suc
ceeding session, when it was brought forward
with tho repealing clause, I likewise su
tained it. At the session which preccdclthe
'residential election of 1MU, 1 earnestly re
sisted the policy of abandoning the Cincin
nati platlorm. 1 saw and stated to many
that there was to be a serious attempt, at
Charleston, to break up the Democratic party
not only to defeat Mr. Douglass, but to af-
iord an occasion for a collision between the
North and tho South. In the Senatorial
caucuses and on the floor of the Senate, I
vehemently opposed the resolutions of Mr.
Davis, of Mississippi, declaring that the ef
fect of those resolutions would be to divide
and thus ensure the defeat of the Democratic
party and the consequent success of the Re
publicans. I declared, further, that this
course would divide the bonthorn elates.
while it would unite the Northern ones, and
thereby greatly increase probability of a civil
war between the two sections. Kven after
the partial rupture at Charleston, and the
parage of Mr. Davis' resolutions, I attended
the convention at Baltimore, and labored
earnestly to effect a reconciliation. I be
lieved that if tho bouthcrn States were all
united, and even failed in the election, vet
such guarantees and assurances would lie
given in that event by the majority, as to
preventa serious collision between the North
and the South.
After the complete rupture of the Demo
cratie party, yielding to the action of the
North Carolina delegation, I supported the
Breckinridge tiekct. I withheld this sup-
port, however, for many weeks, while I ex
erted myself to get up a State Convention in
iNorth laroliua, to promote a Union or a
single Electoral ticket, to be pltdged to vote
for any one of the conservntivu candidates
who might have thclicst chance of success.
1 did not abandon mv hope of ellecting this
result until in the month of September I
met Mr. Douglas at Raleigh, and pressed
the matter on him, earnestly but unsuccess
fully.
When Mr. Lincoln had liecn elected, sec.
ing that some of the cotton States would cer
tainly, secede, and believing that war would
probably occur between them and the Fed
eral Government, and being convinced that
n such a contingency orth Carolina, from
hef geographical and her political position,
would be drawn into it, I advised the mem
bers of the Legislature to call a con
vention immediately in order that the State
might interpose between the parties. 1 then
believed, and still think that if a convention
of the State had been made a temperate
demand, it might have obtained such guar-
intees or assurances as would have preserved
the Union without bloodshed. While I
stated, both publiclv and privately, that I
believed war would lc made if necessary, to
compel the Cotton States to remain in the
Union, I thought it, before the war com
menced, a majority of the Southern Statist
would net, instead of war, the Administra
tion of Mr. Lincoln would give such terms
as would promote agcnoraladjustment. Dur
ing the session of Longrcs which tollowcd 1
sincerely exerted myself to promote, the pas
sage of Mr. Crittenden's propositions, or any
similar arrangement. 1 did not abandon
such hopes at the inauguration of President
Lincoln, but remained in my place as Sena
tor to the close of the extra session.
Soon after the termination of that session
the war commenced, and the State of North
Carolina, by a unanimous vote of her con
vention, passed an ordinance of secession.
In so voting I think every memlicr cor
tectly represented his constituents, and, as
far as I know, every man and woman in the
State subsequently sanctioned that act, but
generally, 1 think, with regret. The singu
lar unanimity then manifested resulted from
the previous position of the two principal
parties in the State. One of these parties)
was termed the "secession party." No mem
ber of this party, as far as I knew, was in
favor of seceding from the Union if assured
that the government would be carried on as
it had previously been conducted. They
believed, however, from declarations of Mr.
Lincoln and many of his prominent sup
porters, made prior to his election, that he
would use all the powrs and advantages of
his position to operate against tho institution
of slavery, and that sooner or later the South
would be driven to resistance by force, and
hence they thought it the better jHilicy to sep
arate at once.
The other party in the Stato was averse
to this, and in favor of awaiting for what
they called an "overt act," or some direct
ly hostile demonstration. They insisted
generally, however, that the Government of
the United States had no right to "coerce,"
or make war on a seceding State, and many
prominent men of tho party had taken the
ground that if any such attempt was made
they would resist it. Hence, on the break
ing out of hostilities and tho call of Presi
dent Lincoln for men, this party, with re
markable unanimity and alacrity, look
ground with the Secessionists. So great
was the zeal of many prominent men among
them, that before the avcmbling of the con
vention, porhapi as many volunteer com
panies had liecn raised from its ranks as
from the original secession party. A 11 the
candidates for tho convention that C knew
took ground before the people for seccftdoh
in fact, though many preferred tho term
"revolution." When tho convcntioii,'there
forc, assembled on the 20th of May, its ac
tion was precisely what every one in the
State pccincd to have anticipated. It is
proper that I should wiv that I had for
years previous condemned the policy of se
cession, and insisted that tlic South would
find it advantageou to remnin in the Union,
even if force were to lie rtwirted to. She
might then liavc acted in concert with her
friends in the Northern StateH. For simi
lar reasons, I thought tliat those who :w
semblcd at Montgomery should have pro
jKiscd no change in the constitution, except
to recognize property in slaves, thereby fa
cilitating a reunion of the State.
Unfortunately for North Carolina, Irowp
ver, she waited until the Cotton State were
at war with the Government of the!nited
States, ami then, as I had foreseen he would
do, she "drifted into it," too late to have a
fair share in the direction of the movement
She ennct'-d over again the jrt which her
delegates had played in the convention of
Charlwton and Italtiraorc. Having fellen
into the rear at the start, her lot was to
make great sacrifice!", to see her sons, while
bearing t!iemlves with the highest eeurage,
devotion and heroism, treated with great
disfavor and extreme meannoM in that quar
ter where they had a right to expect fair
ness, if not commendation.
If a schemo existed among member of
Congress or others to creatoa neccaaitror
occasion for destroying the Union, I "was
never made acquainted with it. If there
was such a plan on foot, iu knowledge
could not have been extended to many.
All thedreunutance brought in rar atten
tion prior to the election of Mr. Lincoln
warned to indicate the contrary with refer
ence to the views of the Senators and that
their obiects were to aflect tho pending
i'renidenttal contest.
1 Though on after the corusunecmcat of
the war I entered the military service, and
except when disabled by the casualties of
battle. wa constantly occupied in that o-
pacitv. Yet I wan nevertheless not inatten
tive to the movements of the civil authori
ties, and still believed tliat there might be a.
union Of all the states under a common gov
ernment. Confident tliat the ?uthcrn
States had the meaa? of refinance, i in the
first three months of tho war the develop
ments at Richmond created apprehensions
of failure on mv mind. For the first two
years of the war, the people gave a cxrdial
and energetic support to our government.
notwithstanding its inefficiency; but early
in tho year IS63 the extraordinary develop-
nicnts at Richmond seemed to indicate that
we were not to be allowed to succeed. There A
arc reasons whv I do not now choose to entur 1
o.n thii branch of tho subject ; but I ought
lwrhaps to say thbt the iuiprosiun was grad
ually made ii the minds of intelligent men ji
that the government was either utterly des
titute ot practical talent, or mat ior some
unexplained reason there wii a purpose to
retard our movements and prolong the war.
This well-founded want of rontutence pre
ceded iU terminal ion.
The creat practical question now presents
itself: What ought to lie the action of the
United States towards the South? I am
not mistaken wlun T say that !n North Car
olina tho determination "to support the Con
stitution and obev the laws of the United
States is universal. There are to be found
here and there, perhaps, individuals in that
fctate who will assert the contrary, aney
are, however, men without consideration or
character, who have oeen msappoinicu in
their attempts to get office, and who charge
the people with being disloyal because they
will not vote for them. No man living in
the State believes there is at present disloy
alty there. The late elections have been de
cided by personal preferences, aided some
what by old party associations. Our people
think that when they have complied with
all the requisitions of the President, they
have a right to choose their representatives.
I know no man in the State, however, that
I believe can take what is commonly called
the "test oath" without perjury. If this be
insisted oil, our State will have only nominal
or counterfeit representative!. Sooner than
have such, many think it as well to have no
representation at all. If those chosen arc true
to the Constitution, the more talent and con
sideration they have the better for tho gov
ernment. When an army surrenders, it is
done bv its oliicerain command, and not by
men taken frum the guardhouse or the rear,
because of their ineftieienev. So is it not
better that the public of the isoutk shn.' 1 com
in with their representative men ? In this
manner the government and the administra ¬
tion will obtain the entire political and
moral supiort of tho States.
It is obvious that there aro in the North
persons who still desire to keep up a ipuui
war on the South. Some of these men ex
pect pecuniary advantages in the form of
places, contracts and job. Another class of
men heck political strength by appealing t
the hostile foelinzs of the masses who hav
not cooled down. Thev persist in regarding
the South asstlllan enemy, and desire I
continued attnckn to make it so. Should t!..''
government yieldtotheirvicws, it will inflict
injury both on the South and itself, with no
corresponding advantage. The Government
of the United Statoi can have till entire
South loyal and true to it by accepting then
as such :"and it will be difficult to make the
people there actively hostile at this time. If
a de.iire for vengeance exist in the mind; of
any persons in the North, it should not be
iorgmten that the Nmthom Stales have uut
fered more pevurely than any community in
modern times. Besides the loss ot so many
of their best nun, probably two-thirds of
their property is gone. The four millions
of slaves, estimated according to their a'.uo
in I860, constituted ono-third of their wc-.!fh,
and the depreciation in- the value of land
and Knees of personal property, aro fuby
equal to another third. By now keeping
them under military rul; for which no rea
son exists whatever, feelings of disaffection
may lie produced, and the oXj)cnditiircs of
the government of the United States can
have all the Southern States again it friends
by allowing them, when they have complied
with the requisitions of tho President, to ex
ercise those privileges which belong, accord
ing to the constitution, to all the States cf
the Union. Very respect fullr, An.,

It is no longer safe to walk the streets of a
