The Supreme Judgship.
We notice by our exchanges
that the name ot Chas. M. Webb,
our circuit judge, is generally and
favorably mentioned for the office
of Chief Justice in place of Justice
Cole, whose term expires next
year.
While we have no knowledge of
Judge Webb’s wishes in the mat
ter, we do know that the members j
of the bar of this and adjoining j
circuits who have had occasion to
practice in his courts are unani- 1
V. . .
rnous in pronouncing him a very
able judge, and that he would have i
their support for the above named
position.
He is now' completing his second ,
term, and last spring was unani
mously elected for a third term as I
judge of this circuit, and lus nom
ination now for Chief Justice would
meet with the general approval of
the bar and the people of this part
of the state.
Commissioner of Pensions Raum
reports a deficiency of $32,000,000
in the allowance for pensions.
Mr. J. W. Babcock, of Necedah,
was elected to the assembly over
K. D. Rogers, democrat, by a
majority of 166. There was talk
at fraud but a recount did not
reveal any.
Tab Pryor, formerly night-watch
in the city of Waupaca, was
arrested lately charged with the
murder of H. C. Mead, October
Bth, 1882. The warrant was
issued on complaint of Messrs.
Wm. Herman and James Meikle
john, of Ncw r London. His
examination takes place this week.
Adams Cos. Press: Two years
ago Morgan, the democratic can
didate for Governor received 430
votes in Adams county. This
year Peck, the candidate of the
same party for Governor, received
292 votes in the county. It will
puzzle even a democrat to figure
gains out of these figures.
Tuesday morning’s Sentinel con
tained the information that the
Milwaukee election returns were
wrongly canvassed and might be
refused by the State Canvassing
Board. It appears that the can
vassing board of Milwaukee county'
was made up of two justices of the
peace and a private citizen. We
will await further results.
PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
Speaker Reed, as tlic hands on
the big clock facing him indicated
noon, called the House to order
and formally declared the second
session of the Fifty-first Congress
opened and ready for business.
After prayer by the Chaplain the
President’s message was received.
When the clerk began reading the
message many of the members
were listless or intent upon reading
newspapers or writing letters; but
as the burning words of patriotism
and party loyalty, which not even
the sing-song tones of the profess
ional reader could make dull, be
gan to pour forth every form was
erect and the closest attention was
paid to every word. Speaker
Reed’s face was a study as the read
ing of the message proceeded. He
smiled most expressively, and from
time to time nodded his head in a
manner which said as plain as any
thing could “those arc my senti
ments;’’ and occasionally brought
his hands together, as if to con
gratulate himself for being a mem
ber of the same party as the man
who could write such a ringing
and timely message just after his
party had been defeated.
The democrats too paid close
attention to the reading of the mes
sage, but their faces did not beam
with satisfaction at the strong
points as did those of the republi
cans. Republicans are all con
gratulating the President, and the
opinion is universal among them
that the message is one of the best
ever sent to congress; and it is no
exaggeration to say that it has
made Mr. Harrison more popular
with republicans in both branches
of congress than he has ever been
before, and the party leaders ex
press the belief that it will put an
affective quietus upon the small,
very small minority of the party
in congress that lost their heads
over the result of the late elections
to such an extent as to be willing
to abandon one of the cardinal
principles of the republican party
in order to carry favor in certain
quarters.
It is now an absolute certainty
that no backward steps will be
taken by the republicans during
this session of Congress. The cry
is “forward, forward,” and the
marching will be done to the same
old party music that has led the
party to its greatest triumphs in
the past, which will be repeated in
the future, just as certain as intel
ligence always in the course of
time gets the best of ignorance.
The republicans are still in control
of both branches of Congress, and
republican ideas will dominate all
the legislation passed between this
and the fourth day of next March,
and in spite of democratic threats,
howls and piteous appeals the
original republican programme,
mapped out long before the elec
tions, is to be carried out to the
letter.

Had smothering spells, short breath, fluttering;
could not sleep on my left side, had much pain

Da. G. C. Osgocd,
Lowell, Mass.
*' Castoria is the best remedy for children of
which I am acquainted. I hope the day is not
far distant when mothers will consider the real
interest of their mild re n, and use Castoria in
stead of the various quack nostrums which are
destroying their loved ones, by forcing opium,
morphine, soothing syrup and other hurtful
agents down their throats, thereby sending
them to premature graves.”

I lie voice
Is easily injured —the slightest irritation of
the throat or larynx at once affecting its
tone, flexibility, or power. All efforts to
sing or speak in public, under such condi

every symptom is removed. To effect a
speedy cure no other medicine is equal to
Ayer’s
Cherry Pectoral
The best of anodynes, this preparation rap
i idly soothes irritation, strengthens the deli

i to its tone and power. No singer or public
i speaker should be without it. Lydia Thomp
| son, the famous actress, certifies: “Ayer’s
Cherry Pectoral Las been of very gr< at ser
vice to me. It improves and strengthens
the voice, and is always effective for the
cure of colds and coughs.”
“Upon several occasions I have suffered
from colds, causing hoarseness and entire
loss of voice. In my profession of an auc
tioneer any affection of the voice or throat
is a serious matter, but at eacli attack, I
have been relieved by a few doses of Ayer’s
Cherry Pectoral. This remedy, with ordi
nary care, has worked such a
WSagicaS Effect
that I have suffered very little inconven
ience. I iiave also used it in my family, with
excellent results, in coughs, colds, &c.”—
Wm. H. Quartly, Minlaton, Australia.
“ In the spring of 1853, at Portsmouth, Ya.,
I vvas.pn strated by a severe attack of ty
i pimid pneumonia. My physicians exhausted
! their remedies, and for one year I was not
| able to even articulate a word. By the ad
! vice of Dr. Shaw I tried Ayer’s Cherry Pec
\ toral, and to my surprise and great joy, in
! less than one month I could converse easily,
i in a natural tone of voice. I continued to
j improve and have become since a well man.
. I have often recommended the Pectoral, and
have never known it to fail.” —George B.

From a letter written by Mrs Ada E.
Hurd, of Grotin, S. D., we quote:
"Was taken with a bad cold, which set
tled on mv lungs, cough set in and
terminated in consumption. Four
doctors gave me up saying I could live
but a short time. I gave myself up to
my Saviour, determined if 1 could not
stay with my friends on earth, I would
meet my loved ones above. My
, husband was advised to get Dr. King’s
Xe\v Discovery for consumption, coughs
and colds. 1 gave it a trial, took in all

God I am now a well and hearty
woman.’’ Trial bottles free at John
