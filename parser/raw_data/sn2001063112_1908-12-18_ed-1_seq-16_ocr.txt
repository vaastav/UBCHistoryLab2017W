Congress realizes that this is the
last whack at President Roosevelt
and the president realizes that he
will have few more opportunities
to present anything to the members,
and consequently it is likely that
there will be a strong passage at
arms between the two, with small
possibility of anything important
being accomplished. The president
can growl, but congress can sit there
in staid and majestic silence and
wait for him to go out of office.
The Brownsville incident is still
before congress. President Roose
velt sent a special message to con
gress enclosing a special report of the
secretary of war and which was se
cured for the department by two
special Investigators. The president
says the report enables the depart
ment to fix definitely the identity of
some of the leading spirits who took
part in shooting private citizens dur
ing the trouble in 1906, and that the
oolored soldiers were clearly to
blame. Senator Foraker enters the
limelight of the Brownsville affair by
Introducing an amendment in the
senate concerning the re-enlistment
of the discharged negroes, which
places this question in the hands of
a tribunal and leaves the president
•high and dry from having anything
to do with the proposition as to their
being taken back into the army.
Abraham Ruef, the San Francis
co grafter and extortionist, has been
found guilty after a sensational
trial lasting 106 days, during the
latter part of which the prosecuting
attorney was nearly killed. Ruef
was for many years the political boss
of San Francisco and he had his
hand on about everything that could
be
forced to give down the money,
the sums secured amounting into
the thousands, all just because he
stood at the head of the department
that could protect them. Ruef be
came avaricious for greater gain, and
Anally fell out with Mayor Schmitz
and then the war began. Ruef
thought his position impregnable,
but his wall of defense was battered
down when two convicts were par
doned from the penitentiary to give
their testimony against him. It has
been a great expense to the county
and city, but the conviction of Abe
Ruef will have a very good and last
to* effect on the grafting proposi
tion In. that city In the future.
The New York World and the In
dianapolis News have been kicking
up quite a fuss in the past week re
lative to the charges made by the
former newspaper concerning the
payment of the money on the Panama
canal to the French government.
Both papers thought they had run the
president to a corner and that any
body else connected with the propo
sition. would be silent. However,
some replies have been made to these
newspapers which characterizes
their statements as absolute' false
hoods, and the gentlemen seem to
have the backing by which they can
substantiate their denials. President
both entered strong denials that there
Roosevelt and Mr. Cromwell have
was any collusion whereby the
Americans in connection with the
Panama canal enterprise succeeded
in making any rakeoft on the sale of
the property. It may become a
sub­|the
ject for investigation by congress,
but we have no doubt but what
the president and his friends will
come off victorious.
The atmosphere is clearing con
siderably on the tariff proposition
at the extra session of congress. Re
ports from Washington are to the
effect that President-elect Taft and
Speaker Cannon are not at logger
heads over this question, and that
the speaker has declared to Mr.
Taft that he is in favor of an honest
and thorough revision of the tariff.
These two gentlemen have held a
conference in the situation and
there does not seem to be any differ
ences existing between them on the
proposition. That a tariff revision
la
absolute necessary has been
'•hown through the meetings that
have been neld In Washington where
the tariff was up for an investlga
tton. The'facta presented there in
dicate that many of the industries
-which supply the needs of the peo
pie of thb country, and those es
pecially of the middle walk of life,
can hive the duty removed. from
certain articles which will bring
labQut a great slaving. That tMs will
be accomplished when the exra ses
%f£aldn of congress convenes there is
fet'-BO room to doubt.

DOANE ROBINSON WRONG.
Canton Leader.—It was 32 years
last June since the nation was told
that Gen. Custer and part of his
regiment, the 7th cavalry, had been
cut to pieces in a bloody battle among
the bluffs bordering the Little Big
Horn river in Montana. Much has
been written of that
memorable
event, and many stories have been
told of how it happened and of the
chief actors in that bloody drama,
until the cowards in that unequal
strife have been made heroes and
the soldiers who died with Custer are
blamed for the slaughter.
interference, could not have got half
way to Custer before the entire Cus-
ter force of 263 men was completely
wiped out. According to the stories
told by the Indians Reno did the only
great credit.
The lecture was well attended and
highly enjoyed by those present."
Of course Mr. Robinson is not so
much to blame for the story he tells
because he had been told these
things by men who didn't know the,ly
facts, yet history would have

IN WESTERN CANADA
As It Was Seen by a Writer Traveling
fj*1'--'• Mi
,* Through the Waving Wheat
Fields.
Emerson Hough, the celebrated
novelist, who made a somewhat ex
tended trip through Western Canada,
during the past summer, grows en
thusiastic in his description of "The
Last Best West," which comprises
the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatch
ewan and Aiuerta, as all other writers
who have ever visited that great
country. To extract from what he
has said we find the following:
"That black strip across the land
scape—it was not the shadow of a
passing cloud, but the record of a
plough! '1 h.-se yellow gray hands
were the fields of stubble already
reaped These other bands of green,
of pale yellow, of deep bright yel
low—they were the fields of wheat,
among which the binders were yet to
do their work ihe cent uries-o.u
soil was finding its first upturned ex
posure to the sun. Surely the plough
had come! There is no more thrill
ing experience than this, of seeing
the ancient wilderness just passing
into the first loose fingers of civilized
man's occupation.
"Here was the wheat, crowuing up
to the trail, high as the wagon seat
as we drove througa. .-»i the edge of
a grumbling cow man unowned but
long occupied range, we reached
down and plucked off ripe wheat in
handsful, crumpling out into the
palm the full ears of triple-rowed
kernels, magnificent grain, the food
which the world must have—that
grain upon which the whole civiliza
tion of the earth seems so strangely
to depend for, when the wheat has
come, civilization has taken hold of
the land never again to loose its
grasp. One who loves the open air
and the wild world cannot suppress a
sigh of regret at first thought of the
passing plains, at the thought of the
dead romance of the rancher but
none the less, there must come the
soberer thought that the wilderness
of this world, as well as the scant
fields of the older world, belong to
the world and the world's peoples.
"Extended personal inquiry in the
course of a long journey failed to dis
cover one farmer who was homesick
or discontented, or who declared that

"In such regions as this, one still

paying no attention to roads al

time of the 'maintraveled road' is

Soon the fences will come along the
highways, and all travel will follow
