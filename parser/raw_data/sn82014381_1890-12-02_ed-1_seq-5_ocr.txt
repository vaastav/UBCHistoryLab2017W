Bhka_4 ie (_:. D.j, December Ist — Buffalo Bill
arrived to-ni^nt on his way East. He was ou
bis way to Sitting Bull's camp, w hen a courier
overtook him with dispatches countermanding
his 7.revious oiders. It appears that the Interior
Department, acting under the advice of Agent
McLaughlin, would not permit the arrest of
fcitting Bull. General Milei and Buffalo Bill
were cf the opinion that his arrest would end
the agitation. McLaughlin believes that the
present cold wave will stop the trouble. The
mi'itary is strong enough at all points, it is now
believed, to protect the settlers, and the trouble
is believed to be over.
-NF.IVOHi.BLE REPORT..
Wa-hingtok, December Ist.—Reports received
at the War Department to-day from the locality
of the threatened Indian b KSUUet are much
less lavorable man for severs! days. They in
dicate that between 1.000 and 'J.OCo"lndians who
refused to come to the Rosebud Agency in re
sponse to the agent's order started westward
toward what is known as the Bad Lands In their
stampede they have committed depredations oa
cabius. GeLcral Brooke telegraphs that thi.
information it pot from bis own scout. He ex
pects to follow the information. Th.sc alarm
ing leports were again the subject of consulta
tion between .Secretary Proctor and Generals
Schoficld ond Miles. The latter has asked Gen
eral Sholield that additional uooi-S be placed
at his command. It i_ understood'that his re
quest was for mounted infantry. The Depart
ment will soon hay.'a large number cf men tr.
its disposal in the region where the turbulent
Indians have gathered. The Sixth Cavalry is
now en its way to the scene.
AFTER SITTING IB I :..
.t. Pail, December Is:.—a Phnccr Press spe
cial fiom Standing Rock agency says: it is con
sidered probeble that Sitting Bull will cocie in
next Saturday, and when he does he will be
arrested. Major McLaughlin, the agent, ssid
today: "There is no reason why Sitting Bull
should net be arrested as soon as he comes wi.h
in the reach of this agency. He has broken his
promise to send his children to school and did
cot feme in last ration day, as or
dered. I have ten tcouts out, and
if the old recreant chines within the
Hmiis of the agency they will bring him. Sitting
Bull should be captured aud conii.ed. His in
fluence is strongly aud constantly f_>r evil, aud
while he docs not participate in the ghost
dances to the extent o! jumping about and yell
ing, etc..he seeps the irenzy at the highest
pitch. ..ail end Jehu Grass are thoroughly
loyal. It soems possible that s.tting Bull will
be a prisoner bel< re many days."

"FRIENDLIES" JOINING THE HOSTILES.
Chicago, December Ist.—A dispatch to the
Daily Sctct from Pine Ridge confirms the report
that many Indians from Roseburg are joining
the hcstiles on the way to Bad Lands. Th» cor

BILLIARD MATCH.
.cha-fer Defeats siosson for the World's
Championship.
New York. December Ist.—Jacob Suhaefer
and George F. Sles-ou played a billiard match
to-night, at the fourteen-iueh balk line, eight
hundred points; fjr the championship cup and
f 1,0.0 a side. Schaefer won, making SOO points,
when Slossou bed only scored 609.
In the seventh inning Schaefer made a run of
b. points, amii great applause. Slossou was
evidently a little nettled by thia. but succeeded
in makirg 42 before he stopped. Schaefer made
1-0 in the eighth innings, and Siosson 19. The
thing went on then without any larger runs
until the seventeenth inning, when Jake by
beautiful playing, .cored 7:1 points. The score
then stood. Schaefer 247, Slossou 162.
In the nineteenth Schaefer gave a wonderful
display, getting the ivories on the line. He
played them back and forth as if on a wire. He
reached and passed the hundred mark safely,
and still kept oa gently ticking the iV-iieß The
audience sat breathlessly waiting, and Schaefer
finally stopped after making 12s. paints.
Siosson looked feverish, and he missed an
easy shot after making ten points.
From this time on the wizard's excellent play
ing seemed to have rattled Slossou sadly. At
the end of the twenty-second inning the score
stood: Schaefer 413, Slcsson 223. Betting was
three and four to one against Siosson.
In the twenty-fourth Jake scored 7_ mere
points, while slossou mad? four. In the twen
ty-seventh Schaefer made 27 and Slossou 42.
The score at the end of the twenty-ninth was:
Schaefer, 543; Siosson, 324 In the thirty-sec
ond Schaefer gave another great exhibition of
nursing, and rolled up eight pomts.
Siosson seemed to play hard, and yet some of
his errors would have shamed au amateur.
Afterward he did better than Jake, but it was
too late. He made two runs of 60 and one of
59, but in the forty-first inning Schaefer ran out
the eight hundred, leaving Siosson at 600. The
averages were: Schaefer, 19 21-41: fcloseon,
14 26-41.
SENATOR STANFORD.
He is a Candidate for No Office Except
Senator.
Washington, December Ist.—The California
Associated Press correspondent called upon
Senator Stanford to-night. He said he could
not pass an opinion on the President's message,
because he had not read it carefully. The cor
respondent called his atteutio i to the report
that a "Blame and Stanford" ticket would be
one of the possibilities for I.L-2.
He responded: "You can say for me that I
am uot a candidate lor any office except that of
Senator."
When csked if he expected the Farmers' Alli
ance in the Convention at Ocala. Florida, to in
dorse his land loan bill or something similar, he
said he had no mode of ascertaining what the
sentiment of the Conventioh would be, but ex
pressed confidence that the farmers generally
would ultimately indorse just such a scheme as
he had proposed.
Senator Stanford thinks the country is begin
ning to appreciate what at first was regarded as
a visionary and chimerical financial scheme.
He announced his intention of pushing it again
during this session.
Senator Stanford will offer in the Senate to
morrow a memorial from the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, urging the establishing
of a training ship in San Francisco harbor, and
recommending the United States ship Hartford
for this purpose.
Stanford will also present a memorial from
the San Diego Chamber of Commerce, asking
for the protection of San Diego harbor by mili
tary fortifications.

pected.
Chief stockholder White spent some time in
Philadelphia trying to recover securities or
money from the Jamisons, but was unable to _o
so. He stated to-day that the bank is solvent,

ELECTIONS BILL.
The Republican Senatorial Caucus De
cides to Press the Measure.
Washington, December Ist—After a lengthy
discussion this afternoon the Republican Sena
torial caucus agreed that the elections bill
would be taken up to-morrow with the under
standing that it be kept before that body until
finally acted upon. Furthermore to "guard
against the expected opposition from the Dem
ocratic minority in the Hue of dilatory tactics,
a committee of five Senators will be appointed
to cooperate with the Republican members of
the Committee on Rules iv the preparation of a
rule to secure the closure of debate when de
tired by the majority.
The old caucus Committee on Order of Busi
ness was reappointed and instructed to prepare
a programme to govern the proceedings of the
Senate aft r the elections bill is disposed of. It
is stated no votes were cast against these de
teiminations of the caucus.
About thirty Republican representatives got
together this afternoon after adjournment of
tho House and informally dncussed the reap
portionment question. Nearly all of the lead
ing Republicans were present. The only con
clusions reached were that for the present there
was no reason to hold a party c.ucus, and ihe
Census Committee should be left frea to deal
with the matter. Several of these present said
no decision was reached as to whether the ap
portionment bill should be passed, but each
one personally insisted that a bill would un
questionably be passed.
THE REASON WHY.
Witty Retort of Congressman Biggs to
Speaker Reed.
Washington. December Ist.—Representative
Bigg* was the first California man to appear ou
the floor of the House to-day, and he was at
once called upon by his colleagues to explain
whj that State had gone Republican. Speaker
Reed, spying him out as one Democrat who
might not be in a boastful mood, walked slowly
up to him:
"How is it." Reed said, "that California went
Republican?"
"Because." replied the old Democrat, "Speak
er Reed aid not take the stump there."
"I was there once." said Mr. Reed.
"1 remember," retorted Biggs,'l got 2,000
Democratic majority that year."
MINISTER MIZNER.
He Has Been Recalled From the Mission
to Central America.
Washtxgtox. December Ist.—Miner's recall
is one ot the principal topics of conversation to
night. It is remarked with surprise that the
State Department succeeded in keeping the
matter from the pu.lic so long. The step was
taken several days ago. but the first intimation
of it was given in the message sent io Congress
to-day by the President, in which he remarked
that he had sati-fied himself that Mizner had
acted in violation of his duty. Various com
ments are made on this action of President
Harrison. Of course the Democrats are glad of
it. but many Republicans express regret and
disapproval of the President's action.
Large Fire in Philadelphia.
Philadelphia, December Ist.—The large es
tablishments of A. Campbell Manufacturing

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
THE PARNELL CASE.
Irish Members of the Commons Discuss
the Situation.
Losiios, December Ist.—The meeting of Irish
members of the Commons to consider what
action the Nationalist party shall take lv regard
to the leadership took place at uoon. Parnell
was the first to arrive. He took the chair aud
called the meeting to order. Telegrams from
the delegates in the United States and from
Archbishop Croke were read. An adjournment
was then taken for luncheon. Prior to the
meeting Parnell held a conference with his
supporters. Joseph Nolan. Kennv, John Red
mond, William Redtno.d, Edward Harrington,
Power, Shiel aud o'Kelly were present at the
.conference.
The proceedings of the meeting were cf the
stormiest character. Parnell's supporters strove
hard to secure another adjournment, urging
that the meeting to decide the question of lead
ership of the Irish party should be held in Dub
lin.
Bexton hotly protested against an adjourn
ment. The majority of the party, he aeelared,
desired to keep the leadership of the pirty un
sullied ard unstained. Sexton's remarks were
frequently interrupted by tremendous cheering
from Parnell's opponents, who composed the
majority of those present.
r.edmond made a passionate appeal to the
members to pause before they deposed from his
rightful positiou the leader of the Irish nation,
who by his unparalleled services had earned
the gratitude ot the Irish people.
Alter K?dmond bad finished Parnell ad
dressed the meeting, spying :u substance: "The
time has come when 1 must speak out ogaiust
the opposition within our party, wbicn has
been created by Gladstone's letter. The men
whose ability has been most conspicuously ex
ercised against me—Healy and Sexton—will
have to bear the responsibility. Healy has
been trained in this warfare. Who telegraphed
to him in America to come back? Who gave
him his first chance to enter public life, and get
him a seat in Parliament? Mr. Healy reminds
me of his services. He hasn't been slow to re
mind me of them at any time. I
understand he attended a recent meet
ing in Lublin, calling on me not to re
tire. Who asked him to uo so? Who asked
McCarthy to travel to Dublin and say he would
be ai' c to give information which would throw
a different complexion op the hidden events.
Where was Sextou at this same meetine?
Where were you all 1 Why did you encourage
m. to maintain the leadership in- the face of
tbe world il you were not going to stand by
me? Why did my officers encourcg. me to
take a position on the bridge, if they were
going to act as traitors and hand me over to
another commander-in-chief.' I Cid not ask
them for a certificate of character given at the
Dublin meet ng."
Referring to the Hawarden proposals, Parnell
said Gladstone told him none of them were
final. "J*or me," ssid Parnell, "it was a ques
tion oi drafting a bill. It was a question of
weak judgment on the part of an J-'nglish poli
tician. It was a question of dealing with .
garrulous old gentleman, who monopolized the
conversation, and with whom, as everybody
who knew him knows, it is difficult to get in a
word edgeways. Before jou vote for my desposi
tion, be sure you are getting the value for it.
On Saturday we were al! agreed thai we would
not have this Gladstone bill. Not a man here
has snid a word in favor of it. Are you sure you
will be able to get anything better? If Healy
or Sexton or McCarthy see the way clear to get
anj thing better, for God's sake let them get it.
I won't stand in their way."
Joseph Nolan submitted an amendment to the
effect that the question ot retirement should be
postponed until the members personally aseer
taine I the views of their constituents, the pa- ty
then to meet in Dublin and decide the matter.
Parnell ruled cut of order any reference to his
conduct in the G'Shea case, acd this brought
him into frequent collision with diflerent speak
ers, especially Healy. wi'h whom Parnell ex
changed hot words. He displayed great passion
throughout. At midnight the meeting ad
journed until noon to-morrow.

NEW SENATORS.
Messrs. Carey and Warren of Wyoming
Take Their .eats.
Wa-hingtox. December Ist.—Swearing in of
Senators-elect this afternoon was an Interesting
episode on the Senate side. Carey and Warren
had been standing on ihe Republican side of
the chamber, talking with Dolph. Plumb and
other Republican Senators. As soon as War

ford offered h:s left arm to Mr. Carey aud Sena
tor Hoar his right arm to Mr. Warren, and the
two new Senators were 1 "ed to the desk of the
presiding officer, where Vice-President Morton
read the oath to them from a printed slip which
he had in his left hand.
When the oath had been administered, Chief
Clerk Johnson placed the written oath before
each of them, and they signed it. Then they
walked unescorted to their desks, which are in
the last row in the Republican side of the
chamber, between the desks of Mr. Power and
Mr. Higgins. For several minutes the new
Senators held a reception, and shook the hands
of one after another oi their fellow-Senators.

the progress of :hos« that are of universal in
tere t.
In view of these conditions, I refrain from
bringing before you at this time some sugges
tions that would otherwise be made, and most
earnestly evoke your attention to the duty of
perfecting the important legislation now well
advanced To some of those measures, which
setm to me inoit important, I now briefly call
your attention.
AM-RICAN STEA._S.IIP LUTES.
I de.-ire to request, with added urgency, the
recommer datiou contained in my last annual
menace i_ relation to the development of
American steamship lines. Tho reciprocity
clau-.e of the tariff bill will be largely limited,
and i'.s benefits retarded and diminished, if a
provision is not contemporaneously made toen
eoorag- tte establishment of Sub-class steam
inic&tlon between our ports and the ports
of such nations as may meet our overtures for
enlarged commercial exchanges. The steam
ship carry::..- the mails steadily and frequently
,-.:. .. fttnng to passengers a comfortable, safe
ami spec ly transit, i:. tbe first condition of for
eign trade. It carries the order o the Luver,
but not al! that is ordered or bought. It gives
to int.- sailing v. sseis such cargoes as are not
ir.:- Dt or perishable, and indirectly, at least,
promt tes that import adjunct of commerce.
Here i* now, both in this couutry and ia the
nations ot Central aud South America, exnecta
ti.-n.nd confidence as to the iucreased'tr.de
that trill give a double value to your [romp;
action upon this question. The present situa
tion of our mall f o__municatiou with Acstralia
illustrates the important-.- of early action by
Congress.
The Oceanic Steamship Company maintains a
line of steamers between Sau Francisco, Sydney
and Au.kland, coushting of three veFsels, two
oi which are of United ..tates registry and one
of foreign registry. For the service done by
this line iv ca: ryiug the mails, we pay annually
the sum of f46,000, being estimated the full tea
acd Cnited Mates inland postage, which is the
limit iixod by law. The colonies of New South
Wales and New Zealaud have been paying an
nually to those lico ti7,OCO forcarryiug the
mails from Sydney and Auckland to San Kran
c;>co. The contract under which this payment
has beeu made is nov.- about to expire, and
tho^e colonies have refused to r.-new the con
ir_cii nnless the United States shall pay a more
equitable proportion ot the turn necessary to
hold the service.
1 am advised by the Postmaster-General that
Ihe United States received for carrying the
Australian mails brought t_ San Francisco in
these steamers by rail to Vancouver, au esti
mated annual income of 175,000, while, as I
have stated, we are paying bnt for the support
o: the steamship line that brings this mail to
us Gnly :-16,000, leaving annually a surplus re
sulting irom this service oi $19,0 0. The
trade of the United States with Aus
tralia, which is in a considerable part car
ried by these steamers, and the whole cf which
is practically dependent upon the mail coni
muniea.sc.ii which they maintain, is largely in
oar favor. Our total exports ot merchandise to
Australian ports during the fiscal year ending
June SO, 189), were 511.266,1.4. while the total
imports of merchandise lrom these ports were
oniy S_,-.7,6:6.
Ii we are not willing to see this imt»rtcnt
Steamship line withdrawn tr continued, with
Vancouver substituted for sau Francisco as the
American terminal, congress should put it in
the power oi the Postmaster-'.eueral to make a
liberal increase in the amount now paid for the
transportation of this important mail.
The South Atlantic and Gulf ports occupy a
very favored position towards the new and im
portant commerce which the reciprocity clause
of the Tariff Act and the Postal Shipping bill
aie designed to promote. Steamship lines'from
these po:ts to some northern poit of Booth
America will almost certainly effect a connec
tion between the railroad systems o.'the conti
nent loug before any continuous line of rail
road can be put iv operation.
The very large appropriation made at last ses
sion for the harbor of Galveston was jU'.Uii-.d,
as it seemed to be by these considerations that
the great Northwest wiil feel the advantage of
a trunk iine to the South, as well as to the Fast.
and ot the new markets opened for the supply of
food products and for many of their manufact
ured products.
INTE_KATIO..\_I. AMEI.tCAX BANKS.
I had occasion in May last to transmit to Con
gress a report adopted by the International
American Conference upon the subject oi the
ineor.Kiration of an international American
bank, with a view to faciiitatiug money ex
change between tne States represented in "that
conference. Such an Institution would greatly
promote the trade we are seeking to develop. I
renew the recommendation that a earef.i and
well guarded charter be granted. I do not
think the power granted should include those
ordinarily exercised by true guarantee and s_fe
deposit companies or that more branches in the
United States should be authorized than are
strictly necessary to accomplish the object pri
marily in view, namely, convenient ioreisu
exchanges.
It is quite important that prompt action
should be taken in this matter, in order that
any appropriations for better communication
with these countries, and any agreement that
may be made for reciprocity of trade may not
be hindered, acd for the convenience of making
exchanges throughout Europe, and the money
centers widened by the tribute which is an
event of Hint method of business.
A bill forthe relief ot the Supreme Court has,
after many" years of discussion, reached a posi
tion when finsl action is easily attainable, and
it is hoped that any differences of opinion may
be so merged as to save the essential featu-es of
this very important measure. In this connec
tion, I earnestly renew mv leeommeudation
that the salaries of Judges of the Cnited States
District Courts be readjusted, that none of them
shall receive less than 15,006 per auuum.
MEXICAN LAND GRANTS.
The subject of adjusted Spanish nad Mexican
land grants, and the urgent necessity for pro
ducing some Commission or tribunal for final
treatment of the question growing out thereof,
was twice brought by me to the atteution of
Congress at the lis' session. Bills have been re
ported from tbe proper Commissions aud both
Houses on the subject, and I very earnestly
hope that this Congress will put aneudtothe
delay which has attended the settlement of dis
putes as to titie-bcaring settlers and claimants
under these grants. Tnese disputes retard pros
perity aud distract the peace ol large and im
portant communities.
SMALL HOLDXHGS OF FALM LANDS.
The Governor of New Mexico, in his last re
port to the Secretary of the Interior, suggests
some modifications of the provision of pending
bills relating to small holdings of farm lauds. I
commend to your atteution the suggesiionsof
the Secretary of the Interior upon this subject.
National eankk.ft law.
The enactment of a national bankrupt law
I still regard as very desirable. The Constitu
tion having given to Congress jurisdiction of
this subject, it should bo exercised and uniform
rules provided for the administration ol the af
fairs of insolvent debtors. The inconvenience
resulting from the occasional and temporary
exercise of this power by Congress and from the
couilicting State codes of msolvtncv, which
come ints force intermediately, should bs re
moved by the enactment of a simple, i .ex
pensive and permanent national bankrupt law.
INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT.
I also renew my recommendation in favor of
legislation affording just copyright protection
for foreign authors on a footing of reciprocal
advantage for authors abroad.
■anOOIBM ALAINST RAILWAY ACCIDENTS.
It may still be possible for this Cojgress to
inaugurate, by suitable legislation, a move
ment looking to uniformity and an increased
safety iv the use of couplers and brakes upon
freight trains engaged in interstate commerce.
'Ihe chief difficulty in the way is to secure an
agreement as to the best appliances, simplicity,
effectiveness, and cost being considered. The
difficulty will only yield to legislation which
should be based upon full inquiry and impar
tial tests. The rurpose should be to secure the
co-operation of all well disposed managers and
owners: but the fearful fact that every years
delay involves the sacrifice ot _:,..0 lives, and
the maiming of 20,000 young men. should plead
both with Congress and managers acaiust auy
needless delay.
WJ.TCB BOTFLY.
The subject of the conservative and equal
distribution of the water supply of arid re
gions has had much attention irom Congress,
but has not as yet been put up in a permanent
end satisfactory basis. The urgency of the
subject does not grow out of any large preseut
demand for the use of the lands for agriculture,
but out of the danger that tbe water supply and
the sites for the necessary catch basins may fall
into the hands of individual or private corpo
rations, and be used to render subservient large
areas dependent on such supply. The owner
of water is the owner of the lands, however
the titles may run.
Allunappropriated water sources and all nec
essary resurveys should be held by the Govern
ment for equal use, at fair rates.'of the home
stead settlers, who will eventually take up these
lands. The United States should not, in my
opiuion, undertake the construction of dams or
canals, but should limit all work to such sur
veys and observations as will determine the
water supply, both surface and subterranean,
the areas capable of irrigation, and the use of
the storage capacity of reservoirs. This done.
Ihe use ot the water and of the leservoir sites
might be granted to the respected States or
Territories, to individuals or associations, upon
the condition that the necessary works should
be constructed and the water furnished at fair
rates, without discrimination, the rates to be
subjected to provisions by tee Legislatures, or
by Boards of Water Commi.sioner', duly con
stituted. The essential thing to be secured is
the common and equal use, at fair rates, of the
accumulated water supply. It were almost bet
ter that these lands should remain and, than
that those who occupy them should become the
slaves of restrained monopolies controlli.g the
essential element of land values and crop re
sults.
FOSTAI. TELEGRAPH.
The use of the telegraph by the Postoffice
Department as a means for the transmission of
written communications is, 1 believe noon
proper terms, quite desirable. The Government
does not own or operate the railroads, and it
should not, I think, own or operate the tele
graph lines It does, however, seem to be quite
practicable for the Government to contract with
the telegraph, as it does with the railroads, to
carry, at specified rate 3, such communicetiins
as the sender may desiguate for this method of
transmission. I recommend that such 'egisla
tion be enacted as will enable the Postoffice De
partment fairiy to test, by experiment, the ad
vantages of such a use of the telegraph.
FREE AND HONE.T ELECTIONS.
If any intelligent and loyal companyof Amer
ican citiz ns were required to catalogue the
essential human conditions of national life, I
do not doubt that with absolute unanimity they
would begin with "free and honest elections,''
and it is gratifying to know that generally there
is a growing and nor. partisan demand fbr bet
ter election laws. But against this sign of hope
and progress must be eet the depressing and un
deniable fact that the election laws and meth
ods are sometimes ennningly controlled to in
sure minority control of the whole volume and
complete the shortcoming of fraud In my last
annual message I suggested th&t the adoption
of the existing law providing a FeCeral super
vision of Congressional electors, offered an
effective method of reforming these abuses.
The need of such a law has manifested itself in
many parts ol .he country, a_<J its wsojesoßs
restraints and penalties will be useful. In all
the con.titutionaiity of such legislation has
been affirmed by the Supreme Court. Its prob
able effectiveness is evidenced by the character
of the opposition that is made to it. It has been
as pionounced as if it were a new exercise ol
Federal power and an invasion of th-rights of
the States
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Congress ha? already fixed the time for the
election of members of Congress. It has de
clared that the vote for members of Congress
must be by written or printed ballot: it has pro
vided for the appointment by the Circuit Court
\ in certain cases, upon the petition of a certain
number of citizens, of election supervisors, and
made it their duty to supervise the registration
of voters conducted by ihe Stste officers; to
challenge persons offering to register; to pers_>n-
Blly inspect and scrutinize the registry lists, and
to affix their names to the lists .'or the purpose
of identification and the prevention of frauds.
to attend at elections, and remain with the
boxes until the votes are all cast and counted:
to attach to the registry lists a.id election re
turns any statement touching th>' accuracy ard
fairness of the registry ana elections, and to
take and transmit to the Clerk of the Hon. c of
Representatives any evidence of fraudulent
practices which may bt. presented t - them.
Tbe same law provides for the appointment
of a Deputy United States Marshal to atteud at
the polls and support the Supervisors in the dis
charge o! their auti.s, and to arrest persons v;o- ;
lating the election laws. The provisions of this
familiar title of the revised stitutes have been
put into exercise by both the great political par
ties, ar.d in the North as well as in the _ rath,
by the filing with the Court of the petitions re
c.uirt Iby law. Itis not, therefore, a question
whether we shall have a Federal election law,
for we now have one, ard have hed for near!v
twenty years, bu. whether we shall have an ef
fective law. The present law stops jast short of
effectiveness, for it surrenders hi tbe local au
thorities ail control over the ceitifieation which
establishes prima lacit right to a seal in the
House of Representatives. This defect should
be cured. Equality of representation and the
purity of the electors must be maintained, or
everything that is valuable in our svstetn of
government is lost. The qualification of an
elector m 1 st be sought in tne law, not in the
opinion, prejudices or fear of any class, how
ever powerful.
The path of the elector to the ballot-box must
be free from ambush of fear and the enticement
of fraud: the count so true and open that none
shall gainsay it. Such a law shall be absolutely
non-partisan and impartial. It should give the
advantage to honesty and the control to ma
j.rites. Surely there is nothing sectional
about this creed. If it shall happen that the
penalties of laws intended to enforce these
rights fall here, and not there, it is not because
the law is sectional, but because, happ.lv.
crime is local, and not universal. Nor should
it be forgotton that every law, whether relating
to elections or any other subject, whether en
acted by tbe Estate or by the nation, has force
behind it. The Courts, the Marshal, or Con
stable, the posse ?oinitatus, the prisons, are all
and always behind the law. One cann-.t be
justly charged wih unfriendliness to any sec
tion or elan who seeks oniy to restrain viola
tions of the law and of personal rights
No conimu-iity will find lawlessness profitable.
No coreniunity can afl. ret to have it known that
the officers who are ch.rgtd with the preserva
tion of the public peace, and the restraint of the
criminal classes, are themselves the product of
fraud or violence. The magistrate is then with
out rest and the law without sanction. Tne
.ioods of lawlessness can be levied and made to
run iv one channel. The killing of an United
States Mars.nl, carrying a writ of arrest for an
election offense, is full of prompting and offense
to men who are pursued by a City Marshal fir a
crime against lite and property. "
But it is said that this legislation will revive
animosities, and some have even suggested
that when the peaceful methods of fraud are
made impossible, they may be supplanted by
intimidation ar.d violence. If the proposed law
gives auy qualified elector by a hair's weight
more than his equal imiuence. or detracts by so
much from any other unqualified elector, it is
fatally impeached. But il the law is equal, and
the animosities it is to evoke grow out of the
fact that some electors bave been accustomed to
exercise the franchise for others as well as for
themselves, then these animosities ought not to
be confessed without shame, and cannot be
given any weight in the discussion without dis
honor.
No choice is left to me but to enforce with
vigor the laws intended to secure to the citizen
his constitutional rithts, aud to recommend
that the inadequatenes. of such laws oe
promptly remedied. If to promote with zeal
and ready interest every project for the devel
opment of its material interests, its rivers, har
bors, mines and factories, and the intelligence,
peace and security under the law of its com
munities aDd its homes, is not ae.eDted as suffi
cient evidence of friendliness to any State or
section, I cannot add connivance at election
practices that not ouly disturb local results, but
rob the election ot other States and sections of
their most priceless political rights.
EX-ENMTI'RES SHOVI.P BE SCRUTINIZED.
The preparation of the general appropriation
bill should be conducted with the greatest care
and closest scrutiny of expenditures. Appro
priations should be adequate to the needs of the
public service, but they should be absolutely
free from prodigality.
I venture again to remind you that the brief
time remaining ior the consideration oi the im
.mrtant legislation now awaiting your attention
offers no margin for waste. If the present duty
is discharged with diligence and courage, the
work of the Fifty-first Congress may be confi
dently .übmitted to the considerate judgment
of the people. Ben.iamis Harrison.
