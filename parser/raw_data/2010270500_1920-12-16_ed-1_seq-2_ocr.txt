WORLD'S HOPE RESTS IN US
America Must Make and Enforce Laws
That Are Unquestionably Just, and
Stand for Right and Justice as
Toward Individual Nations.
Washington, Due. 7. President Wil
son's message to congress was read In
both houses by the clerks, Mr. Wilson
having decided not to deliver It In
person. The message In full follows:
Gentlemen of tho congress:
When I addressed myself to per
forming tho duty laid upon the Presi
dent by tho Constitution to present to
you an annual report of tho state of
tho Union, I found my thought domi
nated by an Immortal sentence of
Abraham Lincoln's, "Let us have
faith that right makes might, and In
that faith let us daro to do our duty
as we understand It;" n sentence Im
mortal because It 'embodied In a form of
utter simplicity and purity the essen
tial faith of tho nation, tho faith In
which It was conceived, nnd the faith
In which it has grown to glory nnd
power.
With that fnlth and the birth of n
nation founded upon It enmo the hope
Into tho world that n new order would
prevail throughout the affairs of mnn
kind, nn order In which reason and
right would tako precedence of covet
ousness and force, nnd I bellevo that
I express tho wish nnd purpose of ev
ery thoughtful Amerlcnn when I sny
that this sentence marks for us In tho
plainest manner the part wo should
piny allko In the arrangement of our
domestic nffnlrs and In our exercise
of Influence upon the affairs of tho
world. Dy this faith, nnd by this faith
nlone, can the world be lifted out of
Its present confusion nnd despair. It
was this faith which prevailed over
tho wicked force of Germany. You
will remember thnt the beginning of
tho end of the war came when tho
German people found themselves face
to face with the conscience of tho
world, nnd realized that right was ev
erywhere arrayed against the wrong
that their government wns attempting
to perpetrate. I think, therefore, thnt
it is truo to say that this wan tmv
faith which won tho war. Certainly
this Is the fnlth with which our gal
lant men went Into tho Held nnd nut
upon tho sens to make sure of victory.
This Is tho mission upon which de
mocracy came Into tho world. Democ
racy Is 11 n assertion of the right of the
individual to live nnd to bo treated
Justly ns against tiny attempt on the
pnrt of nny combination of Individuals
to tunko laws which will overburden
him or which will destroy his eqtinllty
among his fellows In tho matter of
right or privilege, and I think wo nil
realize that the day has come when
democracy Is being put upon Its final,
test. Tho old world Is Just now suf
fering from n wanton rejection of the
principle of democracy nnd 11 substitu
tion of tho prlnclplo of nutocrncy us
asserted In tho name but without the
ntithurtty and sanction of the multi
tude. This Is tho time of nil others
when democracy should prove Its puri
ty nnd ItB splrltunl power to prevail.
It Is surely tho manifest destiny of the
United Stntos to lead In the attempt to
make this spirit prevail.
Two Things for Us to Do.
Thcro nro two ways In which the
United States can assist to accomplish
this great object. First, by offering
the example within her own borders of
the will power of democracy to make
and enforce InwH which are unques
tionably Just and which aro equal In
their administration lnws which se
cure Its full right to labor and yet at
the siuno time safeguard the Integrity
of property, and particularly of thnt
property which Is devoted to the de
velopment of Industry nnd the In
crease of tho necessary wealth of the
world. Second, by standing for right
and Justice as towards Individual na
tions. The law of democracy Is for
tho protection of the weak and the In
fluence of every democracy In the
world should be for the protection of
the weak nation, the nation which s
struggling townrd Its right and to
ward Its proper recognition and Tirlv
liege In the family of nations,
The United States cannot refuso
this role of champion without putting
the stigma of rejection upon the great
and devoted men who brought Its gov
ernment Into exlsteuco and established
It In the face of almost universal op
position and Intrigue, even In .face
of wanton force, as, for example,
against tho order In council of Great
Rrltuln nnd the arbitrary Napoleonic
decrees which Involved us In what wo
kuow as the war of 1812.

Fresno, Cal., Tho kidnaping, last

thoy declare, is an ox-convlet, In con

8rcple Democracy of World.
1 urge yon to consider thnt tho dis
play of tin liuinedliito disposition nn
the part of congress to remedy nnv In
justices or evils that may have shown
themselves 111 our national life will
nfford the most effectual orf.set to the
forces of chnos and tyranny which are
playing so disastrous a part In the
fortunes of the free peoples of moro
than one part of the world. The
United States Is of necessity the sum
pie democracy of the world, nnd the
triumph of democracy depends upon
ItK lCt'SH,
Iteidvei j f-oiu Hie disturbing and
sometimes disastrous effects of the
late war has been exceedingly slow on
the other side of the wuter, nnd has
given promise, I venture to siiy, of
enrly completion only In our own for
tunate country; but even with us tho
recovery hulls nnd Is Impeded nt times,
and there nro Immediate serviceable
acts of legislation which, It seems to
me, we ought to attempt to assist that
recovery and prove tho Indestructible
recuperative force of 0 great govern
ment of the. people. Ono of these Is
to prove that a great democracy con
keep hope ns successfully and In ns
buslness-llko n fashion ns any other
government. It seems to me thnt the
first step townrd proving this Is to
supply ourselves with n method of
handling our estimates and expendi
tures, nnd bringing them to the point
where they will not be an unnecessary
strain upon our tncomo or necessitate
unreasonable tnxatlohi In other words,
n workable budget system, and t sug
gest that two elements nro essential
to such a system namely, not only
that the proposal of appropriations
should be In tho hands of a single
body, such as a single appropriations
committee In each housr- of tho con
gress, but also that this body should
bo brought Into such co-operation with
tho departments of the government
and with the treasury of tho United
States as would enable It to act upon
a complete conspectus of the needs of
the government and tho resources from
which It must draw Its Income.
I reluctantly votoed the budget bill
passed by tho Inst session of tho con
gress becouSe of a constitutional objec
tion. Tim house of representatives
subsequently modified tho bill In order
to meet this objection, in the reviscu
form I believe that the bill, coupled
with action already taken by tho con
gress to revlso Its ruleB and procedure,
furnishes tho foundations for an effec
tive national budget system. I ear
nestly hope, therefore, that ono of the
first steps taken by the present session
of tho congress will bo to pass tho
budgot bill
Marked Gain In Finances.
Tho nation's flnnnces havo shown
marked Improvement during the past
year. Tho total ordlnnry receipts of
$6,694,000,000 for tho fiscal year 1920
exceeded thoso for 1919 by $1,542,000.
000, whllo tho total not ordinary ex
penditures dpnre3sed from J18,514,000.
000 to JC, 403, 000,000. The gross public
debt, which reached Its highest point
on Aug. 31 1919. when It wns 26,r,96.
000,000, had dropped on Nov ., "920.
to 24,17, 000,000. Thcro also ' 'cen
n marked decrcaso In holdings gov
ernment war securities by tho banking
Institutions of the country, as well as
the amount of blllB held by tho federal
reserve banks secured by government
war obligations.
This fortunate result has relieved
tho banks and left them freer to finance
tho needs of ngrlculturo. Industry and
commerce. It bus been duo In largo
part to tho reduction of tho public
debt, especially of tho floating debt,
but moro particularly to tho Improved
distribution of government securities
among permanent Investors. The ces
sation of the government's borrowings
except through short term certificates
of Indebtedness has been a matter of
great consequence to thu people of tho
country at large, as well ns, to tho
holders of Liberty bonds nnd ' Victory
notes, and has had an Important bear
ing on the matter of effective credit
control.
Tho yoar has been characterized by the
progressive withdrawal of the treasury
from tho domestic credit market and
from a position of dominant Inlluenco In
that market. The future coursu will nec
essarily depend upon the extent to which
economies are practiced am. upon tho
burdens placed upon tho treasury, as well
as upon Industrlnl development and tho
mnlntonnnco of tax recolpts at a suf
ficiently high level.
Dig Bond Issue to Mature.
Tho fundamental fact which at prosent
dominates the government's llnanclal sit
uation Is that $7,600,000,000 of Its war In
debtedness matures within the next two
and a half years. Of this amount $2,000,
000,000 are Moating debt and $3,000,000,000
victory notes and war savings certificates.
The llscal program of tho government
must bo determined with reference to
these maturities. Sound policy demands
that the government expenditures be re
duced to the lowest amount which will
permit the various services to oporata
ofllciontly and that government receipts
from taxos nnd salvage bo maintained
surtlctently high to provide for current
requirements, Including Intorost and sink
ing fund charges on tho public debt, and
nt tho snmo tlmo retire the floating debt
and part of tho victory lonn before ma
turity. With rlfild economy, vigorous snlvhge
operations and adequato revenues from
taxation, a surplus of current receipts
over current expenditures can be realized
and should bo applied to the floating debt.
All branches of tho government should
co-opornto to see that this program Is
realized.
I ennnot overemphasize tho necessity
of economy In government appropriations
nnd expenditures nnd the avoidance by
tho congress of practices which take
monoy from tho treasury by Indefinite or
revolving-fund appropriations. The esti
mates for tho pteseut year show thnt
over a billion dollars of expenditures woro
authorized by tho Inst congress In addi
tion to tho amounts shown In tho ubuh!
compiled statement of appropriations.
Specific Appropriations Urged.
This strikingly Illustrates tho Impor
tance of making dliect nnd specific ap
propriations. The relation bolween tho
current receipts and current expenditures
of tho government during the present 11b.
cnl yenr, ns well as during tho Inst half
of tho last llsonl yenr, has been disturbed
by tho extraordinary burdens thrown
upon tho treasury by tho transportation
net. In connection with tho return of tho
mllroadi to pilvntu control, Over $C0O.-
WO.0O0 hus nlrendy boon pnld to the, rail
roads under this net l350,ono,000 during
tho present flsrnl year and It Is estimated
thnt further payments aggregating pos
sibly $1X0.000.0(10 must still bo mndo to the
railroads during tho current yenr. It Is
obvious thnt these largo payments hnvo
already seriously limited tho coverumnnt'a
progress In retiring tho floating debt.
Closely connected wttti this, It seems to
me. Is the necessity for an Immediate
consideration of the revision of our tnx
lnws. blmpllMcatlon of the Income nnd
profits tuxes has become an Immediate
necessity These tnxce performed an In
dlcponsablo service during tho war. Th
need for their slmpllllentlon, however. Is
very treat In order to save tho taxpayer
inconvenience ami expenso and In order
to m ike his liability more certnln and
definite Other and more detailed recom
mendations with regard to tuxes will no
doubt he laid before you by tho secretary
of tho treasury nnd the commissioner of
Internal revenue
in money for the servij they patrioti

will lie rather In realization of. the fact
thnt they vindicated tho rights of their
country and aided in safeguarding civili
zation. The nation's gratitude must bo
effectively revealed to them by the most
ample provision for their medical care
and treatment as well ns for tholr voca
tional training and placement.
The time has come when a more com
plete program can bo formulated and
more satisfactorily administered f."r
their treatment and training, and I earn
estly urgo that the congress give the
matter Its early consideration. Tho sec
retary of tho treasury and tho board for
