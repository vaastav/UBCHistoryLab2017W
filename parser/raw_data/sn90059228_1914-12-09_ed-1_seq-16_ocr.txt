The Heart of Christmas.
Christmas is a birthday celebra
tion. With some people it seems a
'good dea' like their second cousin's,
to whom they drop a postcard or send
a messenger boy with a holly wreath.
Similarly they feel that they have
done the occasion due honor, if the
email boy as sent to the Sunday
school Christmas tree entertainment,
to receive his bag of candy and pop
corn.
Rather it ought to be the annivers
ary of some one inexpressibly dear,
as if of your own mother, father, or
child. Under all the jollity of the
home Christmas tree, the sparkle of
candles and chorus of happy greet
ings, there is the deep sense of thank
fulness that the loved one is here and
near and well. So at the church.
J.t is an occasion for merriment, for
Sunshiny child faces, and the peal of
child laughter. At the same time,
forgetting the Lord and Master of us
all at this birthday celebration is
something like loafing around the
street when your father and mother
celebrate their golden wedding.
Anyone must indeed be blind to
human history, to fail to see what the
coming of Jesus has brought to this
world. Lofty systems of morality
existed before the time of Jesus. But
the high priests of this morality left
the sick man to burn viith fever, and
the poor man to go hungry. Jesus
healed the sick and preached the gos
pel to the jfcior.
It may be said that the greedy
world still tramples under feet the
sick man and the poor man, and the
hand of brother is often turned
against, brother. The cruel war in
Europe xn which' human beings
slaughter one another is owing to the
savagery left in man and is not the
result of the teachings of Him who
proclaimed, Peace on earth, good will
toward men! In so far as men do
it, they are like one who not merely
stays away frqm his* parents' golden
wedding, but comes in and adminis
ters them a kick in the presence of
their guests.
In spite of all, our country is full
of hospitals, hpmes for old people,
almshouses, kindly shrines where
the words of Jesus are translated in
to Christian deeds. Even the hor
rors of war serve to bring out the
nobler traits in man as may be seen
by the efforts made to succor the
wounded and distressed in the strick
en countries. Don't forget the birth
day that made all this possible.

British buyer appeared recently
in Chicago and arranged to purchase
all the available storage eggs in the

that to the nostrils, at least, seem
more deadlv than German bullets can
possibly be. If they are to be used

there is no reason why the spoiled

not be included in the list of articles
that are termed contraband of war.
The Minneapolis Journal last Sun
day contained a page telling of what
becomes of "has been" state poli
ticians. Many of those whose names

everybody's lips now lead simple lives
in one i avocation or another. That
is just as it should be in a democratic
form of government. Cincinnatus
returned to the plow after he had
saved Rome and our statesmen re
turn generally to some productive
work after having done their duty at
saving the country. Yet it must be
admitted that the state does not al
ways gain by discarding the services
of experienced men.
President Wilson in his message
to congress yesterday pleads for

exigency that may arise. He also
advocates extension of our Central
and South American trade, the up
building of our merchant marine,
conservation, self-government for the
Philippines, rural vredits and na
tional economy. He stated verbally
that his administration was practic
ally thru with legislation for the reg

gram evidently being to engage in
watchful waiting to see what fruit
the legislation already enacted may
bring forth.

The Value of Agricultural Training.
Prof. T. N. Carver states that
when a superior knowledge^ of agri
cultural science is added to the pos
session of adequate capital, the pos
sibilities that lie in farming are
greatly increased. It is also true
that with a training in agriculture it
will be easier and more certain that
the necessary capital inquired will be
earned. Either way demands the
trained farmerthe man who knows
th soil the problems that come thru
insect pests and through plant dis
eases the problems of farm busi
ness, including bookkeeping, market
ing and management. No one can
say that the farmer must not be well
trained. The state has made am
ple provision for this training believ
ing that good farming will return
many times the cost of schools that
are established. The farmers are
snowing their appreciation and many
a farm home enjoys the experience of
someone who has studied the prob
lems to be met. At numerous schools
every year hundreds of students
come for the regular or one of the
f.hort courses to get this training.
The Agricultural School at Crooks
tcii specializes in this practical work
and offers opportunities no one can
afford to let slip by.
International Game Preservation.

prairie chickens are concerned, the

not migratory, and coveys range

The Farm Boy Who Can Dream
It is a good thing for the farmer
boy to have an imagination. It is a
good thing for him to "dream dreams
and see visions." It takes the dream
er ,to see the transformation that in
telligent effort will bring to pass' on
the old place. It takes the dreamer
to see how much more desirable that
place will be ten years hence than a
job in a dry goods store. It is the boy
.whp dreams who sees a field of
tnrifty alfalfa where the stunted yel
low corn is growing on the timber
forty. It is the boy who dreams who
sees those hungry looking Cows with
burs in their tails replaced by a herd
of dairy matrons that tax the capaci
ty of the milk can at their milking.
It is the boy who dreams that sees a
waving cornfield where the cattails
are growing, and who sees a woven
wire fence in place of ,the old hedge
and a new barn where* the 'eoiw'shed
is falling to pieces. We need more
dreamers on the farm. Prairie

th mouth of the Pigeon
the extreme northeastern
part of t* state, was one of the ear
iur-trading posts. Here the canoe
loute from Montreal left Lake Supe
rior for the Rainy River, Lake Win
nipeg, and Greit Slave Lake. Fon, du
Lac, at the mouth of the St. LouL
ver. near Duluth, was another ear
ly center of the fur trade. Here the
pelts could be collected easily fuorn
north-central Minnesota and froi 1 the
rgio of the St. Croix River. The
fast settlers on the Upper Mississip
pi ""were also engaged in the fur
tiade. Loiter, in 1843 the Red ltxvei
carts connected the young fur-trad
nf center of St. Paul with the^Hud
son Bay Company's post at Winni
peg Pelts from the forests of ~Min
rtsota and from the far Northwest
developed St. Paul into the greatest
primary fur market in the United
States and one of the greatest cen
teis for fur manufacture in America,
a double distinction which that, city
retains to the present day.
The timber resources of the region
drew the second influx of settlers,
who cam* from all parts of the coun
try. Many lumbermen came even
from Maine, brigning with them the
logging methods so well developed in
New England. The first logs were
cut for market on the St. Croix in the
winter or 1836-1837. The lumber in
dustry grew rapidly, many saw-mills
were bu*lt, and immense quantities
oi logs were i*afted down the* Mis
sissippi as far as St. Louis. Just as
thp fur trade had brought most of
the men into Minnesota in colonial
times, so the lumbering industry
brought most ot the settlers of .terri
torial days.
The third and largest wave of liu-'
l-ugration was brought into the State
by wheat In the- decade from 1865
to 1875. wheat-raising in Minnesota
developed on so large a scale as to
I'idce the State among the leading
producers of the world. The causes
foi this rapid developxnent were
First, the open prairie lands* sq easy
to cultivate second, the fertiTJL .soil
and favorable climate third, the in
troduction of labor-saving machinery
fci x-eaping and threshing fouTfth,
the coming of the railway and, fifth,
a revolution in the milling process.
In 1874, rollers instead of mill
stones were for the iirst time used in
a Minnesota flour mill, the Washburn
A mill in Minneapolis. Minnesota
spring wheat which had yielded only
medium grade of flour, by the 'old
niilstone method now produced the
very highest possible grade of flour
by the new i"oller process. The effect
was immediate. Minneapolis flour
commanded from' SI to $3 more a
barrel than pi-eviously. Minnesota
spring wheat, which had been at a
discount, went to a premium in the
markets. This advance in price
r-iude farming in Minnesota unusual
ly profitable, and caused an immense
rush of immigration during the next
few years.
About 1884, two new industries
made their appearance in Minnesota,
iron mining in the north and dairy
ing in the soutn. Each has developed
immensely, and each has added much
veaith and many settlers to the
Ftate. The growth of cities and
towns in the iron ranges has been
phenomenal.
The reasons for the tremendous in
crease in the iron-ore production are:
The quality, quantity, and accessibil
ity of the ore the low cost of mining
especially ouHhe Mesaba and Cuyuna
ranges where steam shovels are used
the low cost of rail transportation
down grade to Lake Superior and of
water transportation on the GjHat

The dairy and stock industry jhas

advantages for the dairy and
industry: A cool climate, fine

able location for fattening young
stock from the west on its wa|r to
eastern markets, and an unlimited
suply of concentrated food stuff in

barley, which is the best food foi^ the

of South St. Paul.
Manufacturing had its beginnings
xn the earliest days of the State's
hi&itory and has enjoyed healthy] and
continued growth, owing largely to
natural waiter power, the nearneis of
i&w. material, and favorable trans
portation facilities. There remains,
however, the possibility of develop
iron and steel manufactories,

carried to th coal, because it took

Supervision of Communicable Dis
cases in the Smaller Munici-
palities.
(By Dr. "H. W. Hill, Executive
Secretary, Minnesota Public Health
Association.)
The* public health work of today is
very different in character from that
of twenty or even ten years ago in
both big places and in small.
The present conception of a mod
en- Health Department is a body of
highly trained people who really
know all about the diseases they ex
isc to prevent who really know how
to prevent them and who really
have the necessary facilities to really
accomplish prevention.
We no longer believe in a promis
cuous way the old wives' fables that
specific diseases of definite and now
well known origin can develop from
bad smells or decomposing vegetable
pr animal matter. We do not attrib
ute every disease to sewer gas or
swampy land. We recognize that of
ail the diseases man is heir to, the
osies which we can prevent are all
contracted by more or less direct
contact with previous cases and the
modern Health Department is intent
o! knowing and supervising every
case until it can no longer spread the
disease.
Above all we have at last recogniz
ed the apparently only too obvious
fact, nevertheless long overlooked,
that it not the seyei*e case of diph
theria or scarlet fever, tuberculosis
or small-pox that chiefly spreads in
fection, for the severe case is sick in
bed as a rule and comes in contact
almost solely with the doctor and the
rurse. It is, we see now clearly,
the mild, the unrecognized and too
often the deliberately concealed case,
the case not sick -enough to go to bed,
not dck enough even to call a doctor,
that runs about the community at
large and disseminates infection to
al! comers.
The modern Health Department
which contents itself with placarding
severe cases during the height of the
disease is a futile and practically
useless municipal department, unjust
in that it penalizes the honest citizen
who allows his doctor to report the
case, while his neighbors' children
with the same disease escape futile,
because1
for the one case thus isolat
ed, a dozen are often running free
and uncontrolled.
The supervision of infectious dis
eases is today a scientific strenuous
occupation in which the conscientious
and well-posted health officer finds
use for all his medical training, a,
large share of detective ability, infin
ite patience and tact, and above all a
firm jaw and a stiff backbone.
One such man to every 20,000 of
the population would have a marve
lous effect in a very short time in
Minnesota for he would really do
what most local Health Departments
new only go through the form of do
inghe would trace infection, mild,
unrecognized and concealed, through
its many ramifications, and he would
really prevent further spread instead
of accomplishing almost nothing.
The small municipality cannot af
ford such a man even the large ones
in Minnesota still have only part time
health officers with departments un
der-paid, under-manned, unprovided
with proper facilities. I^^lfl
Every municipality of twenty
thousand inhabitants or more should
have one whole time health officer de
voting* himself not to, municipal
*&
housekeeping, cleaning streets or col
lecting garbage, out to the preven
tion of disease and death. Of course,
garbage collection, street cleaning,
etc., are important municipal enter
prises, but are matters calling for ad
ministrative business ability, not the
technical training of a medical man
-in the origin and methods of spread
of contagion. Through what form
of imbecility were our forefathers
led to believe that the ability to dis
tinguish typhoid fever from typhus
fever, training in the use of the mi
croscope or knowledge of the period
during which scarlet fever is infec
tious were prerequisites to organiz
ing a gang of seavangers to make
xeasonably good time from the house
holders' garbage can to the city
dump? Nuisances also must be reg
ulated and abated but these are pure
police duties. An intimate knowledge
ot human anatomy, physiology, and
pathology is not a prerequisite to
finding out Whether or not the smell
fiom a rendering plant causes com
plaint amongst the neighbors. Poor
est of economies is it to use tea
spoons for driving nails. Why train a
man at great expense over long years
to do one thing well and then
sel him to do badly something he has
river learned? The whole time
health officer should therefore have
no such occupations to distract him.
Communities of less than 20,000 may
be united to provide amongst them
selves a similar official.
This conception of Health Depart
ment work is growing everywhere,
but the tendency Js to hand this work
over to the state, because of the dif
hedlties the smaller communities
would have in getting together satis
factorily on a choice. In New York,
Maryland, Wisconsin, in this country,
in Ontario and Quebec across the line
the '.fate government has a number
of such experts each with his own
district to look out for not replacing
the local health officer, but helping
him, doing the things he now leaves
undone, following up mild, unrecog
nised nnd concealed ca^es as he can
not or will not do. i
This we hope to see in Minnesota.
We are asking for twenty such men
in our 84 counties outside Ramsey
nnd Hennepin. The federal govern
ment expert who recently investigat
ed Minnesota health,work has strong
ly recommended this plan in his of
ficial report and we hope to find you
gentlemen convinced and strong sup
porters of it.
Remember that the whole meat of
Health Department is in doing it
and no amount of regulation, advice
or wisdom recorded in your ordin
ance amounts to preventing a single
case of even chicken-pox unless it is
done, not merely talked about or
written about.
WARM BARNS Aip IN'
MILK PRODUCTION
Cold weather is an enemy to milk
production. Dairy herds must be well
housed and comfortable if they are
to give good returns. Warm, well
lighted and well-ventilated barns are
essential to good yields. The tempera
ture of a dairy barn should be kept
between 40 and 60 degrees.
Minnesota Extension Bulletin No.
10, by George P. Grout, to be had by
applying to the Office of Publications,
University Farm, St. Paul, tells how
to care for cows, both in winter and
in summer. Some things it says with
lngard to winter care are as follows:
"Comfort and contentment are the
touchstones of success. When a cow
is comfortable and contented, she re
sponds with a flow of milk far in ex
cess of that she gives when she is un
comfortable and irritated.
"In nothing have the Minnesota
farmers so sinned against their
herds, probably, as in inadequate
shelter provided them against win
ter's cold and summer's heat.
"It is a mistake to turn cows which
are giving milk out into the yards in
very cold weather. If so exposed
while their stalls are being cleaned
01 for other reasons, it should be for
a brief time only.
"In winter as well as in summer
the cow should have good pure water.
She should not be required to drink
water that her owner would be un
willing to drink. The tempe^ture
of -a cow's drinking water should not
be below 55 degrees."

Real Meaning of the Day.
What with the happy bustle and
planning and working and shopping
which Christmas brings, there is real
danger that the deepest significance of
Ihe day may be overlooked. Superfi
cially, Christmas is the season of ever
greens, of gayly decked trees, of Santa
Claus. of feasting and of the giving
and receiving of presents But if that
is all that it is it is not enough.
The heart of Christmasthe meaning
that vitalizes air the observances and
perpetuates the festival throughout the
centuriesis a rude manger in an
oriental khan, wherein lay the J?abe
who was the son of Mary and Son ptf
God. In its very name and in its very
character Christmas is the' birtheWy an
niversary of the Christ Child. They
miss the message of this gladdest day
of the year who have not eyes to dis
