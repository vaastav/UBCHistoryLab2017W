IOWA TEACHER IN PHILIPPINES.
[Fontanelle Observer.]
Letters have recently been received
from Miss Mae Frurote, who
is
one
among the enlightening forces o* civili
zation in the Philippines. She is sta
tioned at Laoag Ilocos Notre, on the is
land of Luzon, and began school work
the first of October. Its location is not
known but she writes that in the event
of trouble it would take three days to
get word to Manila. She writes: "One
of these schools out here is enough to
drive a teacher raving distracted. Ev
ery child talks or studies at the top of
its voice, and the native teachers rave
and shout, and that is all there is of it.
Some of the native teachers know a lit
tle and some don't. My three are pretty
good, comparatively. The man at the
west side is very good, but he has 140
boys in a crowded room. Nothing but
bamboo benches and a howling mob.
They are the worst children 'on earth
anyway. These people would shock an
Indian village speechless. I have a class
of large girls at the central school and
they are not so bad. The western
school, where I have ch'arge of two
teachers, is a caution, lliey can speak
neither English or Spanish and the
teachers do not seem to know much
more. The idea that the children seem
to have is that they must repeat all the
teacher says. I say 'what Is this?' and
they say 'vot isii dls?' It Is killing.
There is omo small blackboard out it
that school and the poor little sinners sit
up on high bamboo benches with their
feet dangling off. The house is bamboo
with woven bamboo partition, the most
picturesque place Imaginable, but not
particularly conducive to school work.
The schools. like everything else under
Spanish rule, were in the fifteenth cen
tury. We are getting along quite well.
I have Just been having a very animat
ed conversation with my landlady, who
speaks six words In Spanish'and I apeak
twelve. She speaks Ilocano fluently.
The boys offered me an after-dinner
cigar (as all the ladies smoke here) and
in declining I explained to them that
only the women of the provinces of
Missouri and Arkansas smoke In the
States. The Island schools are very
much In the embryo state as yet. Our
schools are In session from 7 to 10 a.
m., 3 to 5 p. m., and I teach aagln from
6 to 7 In night school. We have school
every day except Thursday afternoon,
but I think we will soon change that
and have but five days in the week. I
fear th'Ase people are not to be trusted
yet. They have'too many Spanish no
tions and have not the'slightest objec
tions to fighting in a revolt Just for the
fun of it. That Is speaking of the Taga
logs. Ilocanos are much better and
quieter. My two teachers In the central
schools are the great-granddaughters of
a padre. The great-grandmother was
an Agcoila, one of the leading families
fthe province. She had power enough
with the padre to oppress the people so
much that they arose and killed her and
cut off her legs and arms and nailed
them to the church door, starting the
first Ilocano revolt. How is that for
family history

All Sorts of Opinions,
AMERICAN MINISTER "UP-TO
DATE."
The Strang Magasine takes the view
that, in America at least, "the minister
of religion is as up-to-date as any oth
er man," and it exhibits, in letter-press
and illustration, a dozen startllngly
original devices "Inaugurated by the
ministers to attract and hold congrega
tions." To quote from the article:
"The minister who announced that he
would deliver his sermons in a 'red robe'
succeeded in arousing the curiosity of
all within his vicinity and in drawing
large crowds to his church. Still more
daring and original Is the man who il
lustrates his sermons with oil paintings
shown, and even executed, in the pul
pit. The clergyman whose church is
ion-sectarIan, and who says that he
lays claim to no church or particular
congregation, has gained many converts
and Is doing good work. The Rev. C. H.
Tyndall announces that he illustrates
Bible truths by electricty. and has
proved himself a leader in the ranks on
the great march of progress by intro
ducing wireless telegraphy Into his
church.
"The church with a roof garden is well
attended and has an original man at its
head, one who realizes that the hot days
of summer frequently destroy the good
none during the balmy, soul-Inspiring
days of spring, and who has braved
criticism and established codes by build
ing a cool retreat on the roof of his
church where open-air services are
held.
"A Californlan church which has its
choral services conducted by a Chinese
choir understands that the people of the.
twentieth century clamor for novelty,
something to capture the attention and
hold the interest. In this class might
also be mentioned a church In the city
settled by William Penn, where lady
ushers show strangers to a pew."
CHANGES IN METHODISM.
The Literary Digest in an article en
titled "The Changes in New England
Methodism." quotes from several New
England Methodist ministers. We quote
some of these:
Rev. Mr. Davis, a Boston minister,
sums up his changes of belief in these
sentences: "Jesus Christ came on earth
to show us what to do and how to do it.
Others may to advantage theorize as to
the atonement, etc. I have tried to do
so in years gone. Dissatisfaction
crowned my efforts. I have one object
before me now—to follow Jesus, preach
Jesus, lead men to Jesus."
Rev*. Charles H. Stackpole, of Melrose,
is convicted of "the newer and more ra
tional theory of the inspiration of the
scriptures he no longer holds to Paul's
dogmatic theology, founded largely on
an unetenable view of Genesis he is
open to evolution no longer any theory
of the atonement, save that Christ Is the __
supreme expression of God's love and f.'w. Parsons, Ph. D„ paatoK
"all the woeful knowledge of the past
misrepresents the character of
dod and Is d«stined to perish from the
mind of man."
Rev. George S. Butters, of Somervllle,
says: "The theory of the inspiration of
the scriptures which I once steadfastly
held I have been obliged to discard,
holding strongly to the /net of inspira
tion with a satisfactory theory. Ten
years ngo I was strictly a Wesleyan on
the question of entire sanctification. To
day I do not regard that theory either
scriptural or practical."
"The spirit lives only by ceaseless
change of expression." declares Rev. L.
H. Dorchester, of Boston. "The living
organism has glided out of many old
phrases, and is finding fresher, more vi
tal and hence more effective expression
In terms of today's thought and life."
Christ is "the embodiment of divine al
truism, the example and the inspiration
for all service." ,,
CUTTING THE SOUL OUT OF
RELIGION.
TNew York Sun.]
At a banquet of the Congregational
qiub at the Auditorium Rev. Joseph A.
Milburn, of Plymouth Congregational
churbh, commented unfavorably upon
the Moody and Sankey hymns, the
hymns that have moved thousands In
two continents to religious fervor. The
Rev. B. Campbell Morgan, the English
clergyman and authdr, upon whom
many believe the "mantle of Moody"
has fallen, would take the picture of a
"woman clinging to the cross" out of
man feeling—out of religion you take
peyond." When chemistry separates a
man into component elements and gives
us the exact proportion of each It has to
stop and say: "I can not make a man."
Science and logic stand baffled and
abashed at the portals of the soul. It
abashed at tne poriais
has no explanation for the mysterjof
feeling, the sensations of hope, of glad-
ness, of sorrow. And yet we know man
has a soul, for he weeps, he laughs, he
lo.ves, he hopes, he sympathizes, he la
touched by pathos and moved by sweet
music.
It is very clear that religion has to do
with what, for the want of any better
name, we call the "soul." It appeals to
the heart, not the principles of logic. If
it appeals to logic at all it Is only in the
fact that history shows it to have a
mysterious power over the human mind
that eventuates in right conduct. It ap
pears to have laid the foundation for a
system of ethics that has resulted In
