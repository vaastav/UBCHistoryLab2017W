House Against New Innova
ratlcr.
Washington, Dec. 15.—What prob
ably will be the last act of the house
on the subject of simplified spelling
occurred yesterday when on motion
of Mr. Towney, chairman of the ap
propiiations committee, the house,
without debat or division, stuck out
of the legislative and executive -bill
the provision relative to spelling.
The action was taken because of the
promise of the president to revoke
his order to the public printer and the
consequent adoption of yesterday's
resolution.
The simplified form of spelling
will be continued in all correspon
dence emanating from the white
house, notwithstanding what action
may be taken by congress in the mat
ter of spelling public documents.
The use of the simplified form will
include all correspondence between
the. wbjte bouse end public officials,
personal correspondence of the pres
ident and, in fact, all communicat
ions which do not require printing at
the government printing offloe.
to indicate for whom those delegatee
would vote for any other place on the
ticket, says the Idaho Statesman.
Conditions arise at every ante con
vention contest which make it possi
ble for citizens to express their opin
ion Upon candidacies that are of the
first importance and in which they
feel a deep interest. A man may
vote, bat he feels it is about uselew
for him to do so, since in most cases,
be has no idea what his vote will
mean in the final result.
It Is for this reason that the direct
primary is needed. Under such a
law, the voter will vote for the caudi
cUrfeeww-hom be knows to be qualified,
or whom he has reason to believe are
fit for the positions to which they as
pire, and he will not be responsive
in any degree for the nomiuatior of
persons whom he may know to be un
fit and unworthy.
Covering that point—direct vot
ing for the men who are to be the
candidates of the party if they be
successful in the primary contest—
the law may cover details in -.ny
manner that shall appeal to the judg
ment of those whose duty it will be
to frame and adopt it.

j
be upon affidavits,
In an opinion handed down by the
supreme court, written by Justice
Ailshle, Chief Justice Stockslager
and Justice Sullivan ot neurring, the
judgment of Judge Morgau of the
district court of Kootenai county is
reversed in the case of A. P. Howell,
appellant vs. The Springton Lum
ber company, respondents.
In this case the plaintiff, brought
an action for an iojunotion to res
train the lumber company from main
taining a boom across the Coenr d*
Alene river at Springston, alleging
that be was engaged in floating
logs down the river for himself and
for others tor conpenaation and that
the construction of the boom unlaw
fully obstructed the stream and
panght all logs floating down stream
and retained them in the boom of
the defendant company. Plaintiff's
logs detained and boom sticks caught
at defendant's dam, plaintiff cliams,
cused him a damage to the amount of
•20 per day. He also brougth suit
for damages claimed to have been
sustained at the above rate from
March 1. to J-.ne 28 in 1906.
On verification of the complaint
and application a temporary restrain
ing order was allowed and a writ was
issued and given to the sheriff. This
writ and a second one was returneu
without service, the sheriff not being
able to find his party, but a third writ;
was issued on August 11 which was
regularly served. Defendant then
, , , ,
appeared in court and moved that tbe
tempoaray injunction be dissolved on
the grounds that no motion had been
made to keepjthe same in force as was
provided by rule 19 of the district
court rules of practice and for the
further reason that tbe order of Au

reason that, if grant, d after the time'"

The court sus
tained the motion anl au order was
made dissolving tbe temporary in
junction. From this order the ap
peal was taken.
The supreme court holds that the
motion dissolving the temporary in
junction should have oaen denied
and remands the eaae for further pro
ceedings. The opinion says that
