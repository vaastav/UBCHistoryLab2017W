that it will not be called upon to en

troops are planned to be located In
different -parts of the state.
The bill is likely to meet -hard

The expense connected with
maintaining Ave troops of such a
constabulary will have its effeot upon
taxpayers who. already complain of
burdensome taxation. Cities and city
governments will not fall kindly intp
line for a plan that supercedes local
self government and finally there
will arise in the minds of many some
fears and ^conjectures as to the use
fulness at such a force to a gover

serving and have political dehts to be
paid to elements which demand
license as the price of political sup
port. Such governors are sometimes,
elected and even re-elected, even in
Iowa.
HOUSTON'S UNWISE TAX PROPOSALS.
Mr. Houston's reoommendatlons to
oongress as to taxation will meet no
approval from business men and tax*
payers. He seems to have sought
further complication of tax laws al
ready too complicated. Xt has become
necessary for corporations and even
private Individuals to hire experts
and Specialists to figure their taxes.
Indeed when a government official haa
beoome expert on income taxes and
direct taxation he quits government
service for better pay pay from heavy
taxpayers.
Houston's proposals are direct evi
nce against the present system. In
his report he shows that the big sur
taxes up to 70 per cent can not be
collected, jit falls down. Incomes of
oVer 8800,(KK) paid |992,972,08fi in 1918.
They paid $781,872,163 in 1817. Last
year they paid only $892,847,828. The
big Income makers had bought non
taxable securities or taken other ways
ovt
The excess profits tax for 1820
brought about two billions. For 1928
Houston estimates it at about $800,.
000,000, a falling off of /one and one
fifth billions. Conservatively capital
l*kl corporations pay the tax. Over
'capitalised ones escape It The thing
It wrong In theory and iniquitous in
operation.
lo ldesi was fever Aiore erroneous
than that which obtains that the "rich
p*y all tlie taxes." Everyone should
know anil many who did not know
are discovering that taxes and impo
sitions are passed on wherever they
snd that Is, In most instances,
to the Jlml purchaser and consumer.
Houston's proposition is not to slm
pllfy the. system of taxation but to
further complicate it lie wants to
ever»*thing. His proposal as to
Income taxes would place heavier im
positions on Income spent for living.
His plan of Imposts on all manner of
commodities means ^greater annoy
a*c* 4« the public.. He does not favor
sales tax but Jt is not easy to ees

tW.taid by the government and one
laid by the seller, unless the differ

That a bird in a hole is shfer than
