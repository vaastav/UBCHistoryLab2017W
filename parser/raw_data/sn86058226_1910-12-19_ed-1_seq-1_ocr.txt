James L. Cowles Says if Pres

Be Asked for.
Amrlran Newt Srvu)
Wmthlncton, Dec. 19. A parcels
pout w III be one of the most Important
mbjects that the present congress will
have to deal with, and the champions
of this movement feel confident that
home definite steps will be taken to
ward the establishment of this system
before congress adjourns next March.
The, fact that both President Taft.
in his annual message, and Postmaster
General Hitchcock In his annual report
have recommended the. rural parcels
post, has greatly strengthened their
hopes, and they believe that If once
a system Is established for the rural
districts, it will only be a short time
before It in made general.
James Ia Cowles, founder and secre
tary of the Postal 1'rocress league.
says that a vigorous campaign will bo
made this year tn Washington tobrlnrf
about the enactment of Borne parcels
poet legislation.
Ask Special Session.
"Should we fall." he continued, "we
shall urge the President to call a spe
cial session of the 62nd congress to
take up this matter.
"Every effort Is being made by the
members of our league throughout tho
country to bring about the election
of senators pledged to a parcels post
system. We feel confident that a ma
jority of the House members are in
favor of such legislation, and now is
our time to make sure of the senate.
"A mass meeting la to be he'.d in
Cooper Union, New York, on Decem
ber 29. whfftr-irtir twwMmwed by a
number of prominent business men.
and this will be followed by our annual
convention In February.
"At present there are. two bills be
fore congress providing for a parcels
post system the Bennett bill and the
Hulzer bill. Our league favors the Sul
y.er bill because it specifies the limit
on packages. If this bl'.l Is made a
law It will save the people of the
country 160.000.000 a year that they
are now paying to the express com
panles In excessive rates, and convert
the annual deficit of the Postoffice De
partment Into a handsome profit."
Although the sentiment in the House
seems generally favorablo to the par
cel post, there is a strong factor op
posed to it. This is the House Com
mittee on Postofflces and Post-roads
Representative Weeks, of Massachu
setts, the chairman of this body, has
expressed himself very forcibly as on-
itoaed to any legislation of this kind.
and he apparently has the support of
the majority of the committee. With
the end of the present session, how
ever, ten of these lose their seats In
the House, and there will be a new
committee with a new chairman, when
the 62nd congress opens.
The arguments for and against a
parcels post are many, and have been
reiterated time and again, and it Is
safe to say that they will be present
ed in amplified form at this session.
Rep. Suiter's Bill.
Representative Sulzer's bill Is as fol
lows:
Be It enacted, etc, That the common
weight limit of the domestic postal
service of the United States is here
by Increased to 11 pounds, the com
mon limit of the Universal Postal
Union, and that In the general bus!

SEVERAL CLAIMS ,
FOR REPARATION
Interstate Commissioner Is in
Chicago to Conduct
a Hearing.
(American News Service)
Chicago, 111., Dec. 19. Interstate
Commerce Commissioner Edgar E.
Clark arrived in Chicago today to con
duct a hearing in the so-called Burn-
bam-lianna-Munger case. This is also
known as the Missouri river rate case
and after it was begun the Interstate
Commerce commission in accordance
with evidence that had been introduc
ed, reduced freight rates from the At
lantic seaboard to the Missouri river.
Litigation ensued, and the reduction
in rates was suspended until Novem
ber 10 last.
Tho Interstate Commerce commis
than $100,000 already have been fled
with the commission under its decis
ion reducing rates. A typical case is
that of the William Warnock company
of Sioux City, la., against the Chica
go & Northwestern railway company.
Reparation is demanded on all ship
ments of class freights from the east
to Sioux City during the period of the
commission's original order. The re
duction, which was sustained by the
United States supreme court, amount
ed to nine cents a hundred pounds on
first class freight, the reductions on
classes being from a sixty-cent scale
to a fifty-one cent scale.
The linterstate Commerce commis
sion has received to date nearly 800
claims in reparation. About 450 of
them apply to shipments originating
in Atlantic seaboard and Eastern
trunk line territories, about 200 to
shipments originating at various
points east of the Mississippi river
and, north of the Ohio, and the remain
der are shipments originating in the
Central Freight association and South
eastern territories. In addition to the
claims already on file, other claims
will be presented and the likelihood is
that eventually the aggregate will be
in the neighborhood of a million dol
lars. Final disposition of these claims
probably will hinge upon the result of
the Burnham-Hanna-Munger case,
which is to be heard here this week
by Commissioner Clark.

SENATE WRESTLING
WITH LORIMERTASE
The Fight for the Vindication
of Senator Began to
Brew Early Today.
(American News Service)
Washington, Dec. 19. Fight of the
vindication of Senator Lorimer began
to brew teday in the senate. Bever
ldge and La Follette of Wisconsin are
in the limelight to a considerable ex
tent just now. Beveridge is on the
senate committee of privileges and
elections. The sub-committee which
investigated the Lorimer case made
its report to the main committee. So
far the report is secret, though it is
well known that it gives Lorimer a
clean bill of health, and takes the po
sition that not enough members of the
legislature are shown to have been
concerned in' the bribery to have
changed the result of the election.
More over it is not shown, the sub
committee finds that Lorimer had any
hand in the bribery. In some quar
ters in the senate it is felt that the
sub-committee has been unduly len
ient and members of the main commit
tee should make a most careful study
of the testimony for themselves. Bev
eridge is proceeding on the theory
that nothing is to be taken for grant
ed and that it is up to him to explore
the testimony for himself. If there
should be a minority report of the
committee it is generally supposed
Beveridge will make it. La Follette is
not on the privileges and elections
committee, and Is 'not taking part in
the case. He cannot do so under the
circumstances. But if the report made
to (he senate is adverse to the major
ity report there is not much doubt
that La Follette would get into the
game and go into an analysis of the
case. More ways than one. La Fol
lette has indicated his disgust at the
"jackpotters" of the Illinois legislature
and nobody doubts he will give ex
pression to his sentiments about the
whole proceeding that culminated in
Lorimer's election, if there is an op
portunity and seems to be warrant for
it in the nature of anything that
comes out of the committee. But no
matter what report is made no ques
tion is longer entertained that Lorim
er will keep his seat. It is against
precedent for the senate to expel any
one.
FIRM WILL LOCATE
HERE PERMANENTLY
The Pilot Motor Car company,
which recenUy considered leaving the
city, because of lack of capital, is now
located here permanently, the neces
sary capital having been received. The
prospects of the company for 1911 are
extremely bright. The Pilot line, of
automobiles is being manufactured.
George Seidel. C. W. and Horace Kra
mer are the largest stock holders in
the concern.
A REAL AEROPLANE
-MAY STOP IN CITY
Providing Sufficient Induce
ment Is Offered Jordon
Receives a Letter.
Richmond may be one of the stop
ping places of aero places competin
for the William R. Hurst prize of $50,'
000. Charles W. Jordan, secretary of
the Commercial club, received a letter
today from an official of the New York
American saying that these aeroplanes
would probably make many stops over
the country, descending in cities which
would offer sufficient inducements
As good prizes will probably be of
fered in Columbus, Dayton and India
napolis, it is likely the course of sev
eral of the aviators' will pass over
Richmond, in which case only small
sums of money will be required for a
stop. The matter will be put before
the local Commercial club at the Janu
ary meeting but just what action will
be.taken on the affair is impossible
to state at this time.
The offer made by Hurst provides
that the machines may be stopped at
any time along the course and repairs
made at any time. The start may be
made from 'New York or Boston and
the finish at San Francisco or Los
Angeles. Starts may be made at 'the
Western cities and finishes at the
Eastern points. All the machines must
pass through Chicago. It is provided
that the machines must cross the con
tinent in 30 days and shall compete
for a prize before October 1, 1911.
CORN FROM SEED
STORED IN MUMMY
(American News Service)
Jeffersonviile, Ind., Dec. 19. The
third annual corn show of the Clark
County Corn Growers' Association was
held here and no exhibit attracted
more attention among the farmers and
other visitors than an ear of corn sent
by Mrs. Sallie Marshall Hardy, which
was grown it is said, from seed taken
from an Egyptian mummy. The mum
my was placed in a tomb one thou
sand years ago and the corn was plao
ed with it. The corn raised from
the seed resembles ordinary sweet
corn and the ear is about five inches
long, a few gTains of yellow and white
corn, due, it is said, to being gTown
among other varieties.
Mrs. Hardy is a descendant of Chief
Justice John Marshall and is a woman
of education and culture. She is
proprietor of an antique and curio
store in Louisville and has recently

AN URGENT APPEAL
SENT BY MINISTRY
Towns and Villages Have
Been Seized by Revolu
tionists and Citizens Shot
Down in Cold Blood
(American News Service)
Pekin. Dec. 19. The southern part
of the Chinese province of Kwangsi
and the southwestern part of Kwang
tung are in a state of revolt against
the authority of the empire, American
schools, missions and hospitals have
been destroyed; foreigners driven out
and hundreds of peaceful Chinese and
soldiers slain.
Following an urgent appeal sent
here from Canton, the ministry todaj"
ordered every available soldier put in
the field against the revolutionists.
Nearly three thousand Chinese, no
better than brigands and pirates hold
tae districts in a state of terror. Towns
and villages have been attacked and
seized and citizens shot down in cold
blood. The outwardly is identical
with that of the Boxers and in some
quarters this is looked upon as a seri
ous series of outrages directed by the
secret chieftains of the Boxer clan.
The center of the revolt is the city
of Lien-Chow, which is in possession
of the outlaws. The American institu
tions there have all been burned.
Soldiers Tortured.
Perfect Woo. of Lien-Chow, sent
word to Canton that the Cantonese
lorce original. y sent to quell the up
rising had met with serious defeata
and that scores of soldiers had been
killed by the brigands. The soldiers
captured alive were subjected to grew-
some tortures. j Webster
The authorities maintain that the;Qreen
rebel forceswer. recruited . by secret Jefferson TJtiV
Chinese societies and that plans for
this uprising In the sourt have been
under way for many months. The out
laws are well equipped with arms and
ammunition.
They have seized boats upon the riv
ers and manned them with their armed
forces. Stores and residences . are be
ing looted and bloodshed is rampanf.
For some time the attitude of the
secret societies has been causing the
Pekin authorities much alarm. Here
tofore the leaders have treated
with government troops but recently
the highbinders have shown a disposi
tion to carry on their warfares against
the government instead of against
their private enemies. .
CLUBS MAY UNITE
Commercial Club and Y. M.
B. C. May Be Affiliated.
At the organization meetings of the
Y'oung Men's Business club and the
Commercial club which will be held
soon, a question of importance likely
to he debated upon will be the affilia
tion of the two clubs. The matter has
been contemplated and talked over be
fore but no deinite action taken.
The two organizations hold such an
important position in the business
life of Richmond, that whenever any
matter of consequence arises, com
mittees from both clubs are appoint
ed. Very few questions of great im
portance are considered by one or
ganization without the other being
consulted, and this has given rise to
a rumor that the clubs will form a
coalition. Leaders in both organiza
tions say that the matter has not been
formally introduced in either of the
clubs.

near the wrecked building during an
investigation of the explosion at the
New York Central power house.
New York, Dec. 19. Twenty-four
persons, including three women, were
blown to atoms, crushed, or burned to
death by an explosion and fire that de
stroyed the new power house of the
New York Central railroad shortiy af
ter eight o'clock this forenoon. The
loss is half a million dollars. More
than a hundred were injured, a dozen
of whom probably will die. Thirteen
bodies, all but two identified had been
recovered up to noon. Other victims
are still in the ruins. The disaster
was caused by an explosion of the bat
tery of boilers under the new power
house, at the corner of Lexington av
nue and Fiftieth street. Fire Im
mediately followed and .communicat
ing with big gas tanks stored there
which exploded but a few seconds li
ter. Another explanation, is that a
workman dropped a crowbar on the
third rail the flash therefrom explod
ing the gas tanks and boilers follow
ing. All who could give definite infor
mation as to the cause are dead.
Buildings for half a mile around were
almost shaken from their foundations
and threatened to collapse. A Lexing
ton avenue surface ear. a block away
was lifted from the tracks and hurled
against a passing automobile, killing
three persons outright, and injuring a
dozen others. Late rising , guests in
nearby hotels were Utterly thrown out
of bed by the jarring of buildings, and
rushed through corrlders in pajamas
thinking an earthquake was in pro
gress. ",
30 Persons in Building.
About thirty persons were in the
powerhouse at the time the explosion
occurred. The building was a two
story one. with a carpenter shdp oil
the second floor. The first floor and
basement were used for boiler, engines
and dynamos, which supplied most of
the power for the third rail system on
the New York Central road.'
Twenty carpenters worked on the
second floor. On the flrBt floor and in
the basement were ten firemen, en
gineers and their assistants.
The explosion came without warn

er house, and breaking windows for
blocks around.
Those who were in the power house
did not have a chance to flee. When
the boiler burst the floors and walls
collapsed.
Those who escaped happened to be
beneath something that withstood the
downfall of bricks, atee! and mortar.
Among the first to get into the ruins
was Father McQuade of St. Patrick's
cathedral. He administered the last
rites of the Roman Catholic church
to seven men.
Firemen Are Heroes.
Firemen did heroic work in going
into the ruins and saving injured men.
Battalion Chief John Duffy was se
verely injured while aiding In this
work.
The first of the dead to-be identified
was Thomas Starr, a watchman em
ployed at the power house.
Two children were picked up In
Lexington avenue near 50th street af
ter the explosion, with their legs cut
off. Besides a man and a boy who
were killed when the surface car ov
