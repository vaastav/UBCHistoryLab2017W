TAFTS MESSAGE? A- FINE
GRAND STAND' PLAY .
It's a fine grandstand play,
President Taft has made with his
message to'congress.
All devoted to condemnation
of naughty trusts is that message,
every word of if. Yes, sir!
And not a single line about the
tariff in it, either, you'll notice!
Which is what -makes it af
grandstand play.
It's an old, old political game
old as the time when there first:
were enough people in the world
for ambitious and grasping per-r
sons to fool. v
Encourage the people to sit up
and holler against the iniquities'
caused by certain conditions. Bui
don't let 'em talk about the condi-
, a
tions.
It is the tariff that made the
trusts.
If it hadn't been for the gener-i
erousaid lent by our beloved gov-t
eminent to such infant industries'
as Standard Oil or the Steel Trust!
these two "babies 'of industry)
would never have acquired the
size they have, nor learned sot,
much about" helping themselves;
to other people's property.
Yes, sir! It's a fine message
that of President Taft! Enforce
the Sherman law! Create a fed-
eral bureau .tb control the trusts!
Slap Morgan bn the wrist, and
tell him how naughty he is ! Hol4
ler your head off if you like !
But don't touch the sacred
tariff! '
