PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
[Continued from Fir$t Pag*.]
War Department estimate* for the figcal
year ending June 30, 1881, ore $40,880,428
93, the eauio being for a loss nam of
money than any annual estimate rendered
to Congress from that Department duriug
a period of at loast twelve years.
He concura with the General of the
Army in recommending such legislation
as will anthorizu tho enlistment of the full
number of twentv-five thousand men for
the lino of tho Armv, exclusive of the
three thousand four hundred and sixty*
three men required for detachment duty,
and therefore uot avuilablo for service in
the Held.
Ho also recommends that Congress be
asVod to provide by law for tho disposition
of a large number of abandoned military
posts and reservations, which, though
very valuablo in themselves, have been
rendered useless for military purposes by
the advance of civilization auUaeUleuient.
IIo unites with the Quartermaster General
in recommending that an appropriation
be made for tho construction of a
cheap and perfectly tlie-proof building for
the safe blorage of a vast amount of money
accounts, voucher*, claims, and other valuable
records now in tho Quartermaster
lioneral'aoflU'e, and exposed to great rl*k
oi local uesiruouon uy lire.
lie alsorecommendsin conformity with
tho views of tho J Ailvocatc General,
some declaratory legislation in reference
(o the military flUtute of limitations as
applied to I ho crime of desertion.
In these several recommendations i
concur.
TIIK WAR DSI'AliTHKXT.
The Secretary of War further reports,
t hat the work for the improvement of the
South 1'uss of tho Mississippi liver, under
contract with Mr. Jameali. JCada, made in
pursimnce of hii act of OongreM, lias been
prosecuted during tile past year, with a
greater measure of success in tho attainment
of results than during any previous
vear. Tho channel through the South
I'ukh. which, at the beginning of opera*
tloiiH in Juno, 1875, had u depth of only
seven and one-half feet of water, had. on
the 8tl? of July, 187l?, a. minimum depth of
twenty-six feet, having a width of not leas
than two hundred feet and a central depth
of thirty feet. Payments have been made
in accordance witfi the statute, as tho work
progressed, amounting iu the aggregate to
$4,260,000; and further paymenta will become
due, as provided ^ by the statute, in
the event of success in maintaining the
channel now secured.
The reports of tho General of the army
and of his subordinates, present a full and
detailed account .of the military operations
for tho suppression of hostilities
among the Iudianfcof the IJte and Apache
tribes, and praise is justly awarded to tho
oflicers and troops engaged, for promptU08S,
hkilland courage displayed.
Tho past year has been ono of almost
unbroken peace and (juiet on tho Mexica&
frontier, and there is reason to believe
that the etl'orts of this Government and of
Mexico, to maintain order iu that region,
tt'tll nraifn tiorinnnunf 1 ? ctiodncafnl
This Department was enabled during
tho pnst year lo find temporary though
crowded accommodations, and a safe
depository for a portion of its records, in
the commote east wine of the building,
designed for the Rate, War and Navy .Departments.
The construction of the north
wing of the building, a part of the structure
intended for the use of the War Department,
ia being carried forward with all
possible dispatch, and the work should receive
from Congress such liberal appropriations
aa will secure its speedy completion.
T1IK .NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy
sliows continued improvement in that
branch of the service during the last lineal
year. Extensive repairs have been made
upon vessels, and two now ships have
been completed and uiade ready for sea.
The total expenditures of theyearended
June SO, 1870, includingspeeiflcapproprialions
not estimated for by tho Department,
were $13,555,710 01). The expenses chargeable
to tho year, nfler deducting the
amount of theno specific appropriations,
were $13,343,317.70; hut this is subject to
a reduction of 5-83,725.09, that amount
having been drawn upon warrants, but not
paid out during the year. The amount of
appropriations applicable to the last fiscal
year was $14 53$,(HQ. 17. There was, therelore,
a balance of $1,470,054 37 remaining
unexpended, and to the credit of tho Department,
on June SO, 1870. Tho estimates
for the fiscal veur ending Juno 30,
18S1, are $14,804,147.95, which exceeds the
appropriations for the present fiscal year
$301,807.28. Tho rcnaon for this increase
is explained in the,Secretary's report. The
appropriations available for the present
Jiscal year are $14,502,250.07, which will,
in the opinion of the Secretary, answer all
the ordinary demands of tho service. The
amount drawn from the Treasury from
July 1 to November 1,1S70, was $5,770,404.12,
of whioh $1,005,440 33 has been refunded,
loaving us tho expenditure for
that period $4,074,903.70.
if the expenditures of the remaining
two-thirds ol the year do not exceed the
proportion for these four months, there
will remain unexpended, at tho end of
tho year, $477,859 30 of the current appropriations.
The report of the .Secretary
shows the gratifying fact that among all
the disbursing officers of the pay corps of
tho Navy there is not one who is a defaulter
to the extent of a single dollar. I
uuiio wiui mm in recommending mo removal
of the Observatory to a inorc
healthful location. That institution reMeets
credit upon t lie nation, and has ob?
taiued the approbation of scientific men
iii all part* of the world. lta removal
from its present location would not Qnly
be conclusive to the health of its officers
and professors, but would greatly increase
its usefulness.
JUDICIARY? MO HE CIRCUIT JUDGES XTIKDKU.
The appropriation for judicial expenses,
which has heretofore been inade for the
Department of Justicc, in gross, was subdivided
at the last session of Congress,
and no appropriation whatever was uiado
for the payment of the fees of marshals
and their deputies, either in the service
of process or for the discharge of other
duties; and, since June 30, these oflicers
have continued the performance of their
duties, without compensation from the
Government, takiui* upon themselves the
necessary incidental outlays, as \frell as
rendering their own services. In only a
few unavoidable instances has the proper
execution of the process of tho United
States failed by reusou of tho absence of
the requisite appropriation. This course
of pflic.ial conduct on tho part of these
officer*, highly creditable to their fidelity,
was advised by the Attorney General,
who informed them, however, that they
would necessarily have to rely for their
compensation upon tho prospect of future
legislation by Congress, i therefore especially
recommend that immediate appropriation
be made by Congress for this
purpose.
'I iim m't innl-ini? tlinnrincinftl nnnrnnrin- '
tiou for the department of Justice at pre-1
vious Bt'ssiotiH l)ununiformly contained the
following clause: "And for defraying the
expenses which may bo incurred in tiie
enforcement of tlio ant approved February
28,1870, entitled 'an net to amend au
act approvod May IIO, 1870, entitled 'An
act to enforce the rifrfit of citizens of the
United States to vote in tlio several States
of tho United States, and for 6ther purpurea,'or
any acts amendatory thereof or
HUpplementarv thereto.'"
No appropriation was made for this purpose
fur the curreut year. As no general
election for members of Congress occurred,
tho omission was a matter of little
practical importance.' Stich election will,
however, t?ke place during the ensuing
year, and the appropriation made for tho
l?ay of marshals and deputies should be
sufficient to embrace compensation for the
services they may lie required to perioral
at such election*).
The buainwaol tbo Supreme Court Is,
at present, h>r?el.v in arrears. It cannot
l>o expected that more causes can be decided
than are now disposed ol In it* annual
session, or that by any assiduity the
distinguished magistrates' who compose
the Court can uccompiish more than la
bo? done. In Uie courts ol many ol the
' "-t\ V*
circuit*, lino, the business hu increased to
such an extent that the deity of justice
will call the attention of Congress to an
appropriate remedy. It is believed that
all Is done In each circuit which can fairly
bo expected from lis Judicial force. The
evils arising from delay are leas heavily
felt by the United States than by private
suitors, aa its causes are tdvanced by the
courts when it is teen that they lnvolrt
the discussion of question! of a public
chiracter.
The remedy suggested by the Attorney
General Is the appointment of additional
circuit judges and the creation of an inter
mediate court ol errors and tppeals, wblct
shall relievo the Supreme Court of a par
of Its jurisdiction, while larger force ii
alto obtained for the performance of dr
cult duties.
I conunend this suggestion to the con
sideratlon of Confront. It would seem tt
afford a complete remedy, and would ia
volve, if ten additional circuit judges an
appointed, an expenditure, at the preson
rate of salaries, of not more than sixtj
thousand dollars a year, which would cer
tainly be small in comparison with tin
object* to be attained.
TI1K PO8TOFKICM DEPABTMBNT.
The report of tho Postmaster Genera
bears testimony to tho general revival o
buHiness throughout the country. The re
ceipta of the Postofllce Department for th
year ended June 150, 1870, were $30,041,
U82 SO, being $704,405 01 more than th
revenues of tho preceding year. Th
amount realized from the sale of postal
stamps, stamped envelopes, and posts
cards, was $701,40-*) OL more than in th
preceding year, and $2,387,550 23 mor
than in 1877. The expenditures of th<
Department wore $33,440,800 45, of whic
tliesum of $370,401 03 was paid on liubili
tios incurred in preceding years.
The expenditures during the year wer
$801,200 77 less than in the preceding yeai
This reduction is to be attributed mainl;
to the operation of the law passed Jun
17, 1878, changing the compensation <
postmasters from a commission on th
value of stamps sold, to a commission o
stamps cancelled.
The amount drawn from the l'reasur
on appropriations in addition to the revt
nuesof the department was $3,031,454 IN
uuiuk ou it?8? man in inoprecet
iug year.
The expenditures for the fiscal year ent
in# June UO,1881, are estimated at lltl)
820,000, and the receipts from all sourct
at ?*.12,210,000, leaving a deficiency tot
appropriated (or, out of tho Treasury (
f7,no,uoo.
The relations of tho department wit
railroad com nan ies have been hurmonizet
notwithstanding the general reduction b
Congress of their compensation, by tlj
appropriation for social facilities, and tli
railway postofBce lines have been great!
extended, especially in the Souther
Slates. The interests of the railway ma
service and of the public would be greatl
promoted, and the expenditures could L
more readily controlled by the classifta
tion of the employes of the railway ma
service as recommended by the Toatmasti
Genera), the appropriation for salarie
with respect to which the maximum lim
is already lixeH by law, to be made i
gross.
The Postmaster General recommends a
amendment to the law regulating the ii
crease of compensations for increased se
vice and increased speed on star routes, i
as to enable him to advertise for proposa
for such increased service and speed. IJ
also suggests the advantages to accrue i
the commerce of the country from the ei
actment of a general law authorizing coi
tracts with American built steamers, ca
rvingtho American ilag, for traneportic
the mail between ports of the Unite
States and ports of the West Indies an
South America, at a lixed maximum pi
mile, the amount to be expended ben
regulated by annual appropriations, i
like manner with the amount paid for tl
domestic star service.
The arrangement made by the Postraa
ter General and the Secretary of theTrea
ury for the collection of duty upon bool
received in the mail from foreign coui
tries, has proved fo satisfactory in i
practical operation that the recommend
tion is now made, that Congress shall c:
tend the provisions of the act of March
1871), under which this arrangement wi
made, so as to apply to all other duiiab
articles received in the mails from foreig
countries.
THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT-?THE INDIA
QUESTION.
The reports of the Secretary of tho Ii
teriorandof tho Commissioner of India
Affairs, setting forth tho present state <
our relations with the Indian tribes o
our territory, the measures taken to a<
vance their civilization and prosperity
aud the progress already achieved lj
them, will be found of more than ordint
ry interest. The genoral conduct of ot
Indian population has been so satisfacU
ry that the occurronce of two disturbai
ces, which resulted in bloodshed and d<
struction of property, is all the more to 1j
lamented.
Tho history of tho outbreak on th
Whito River lite reservation in Water
Colorado baa become so familiar by elal
orate- reports in tho public pre?8, that ii
remarkable incidents need not be state
here in detail. It is oxpectcd that the sc
t lenient of this dill lenity will lead to sue
arrangements as will prevent further hoi
tile contact between the Indians and Ui
liorder settlements in Western Coloradc
The other disturbance occurred at th
Mescalero agency, in Now Mexico, wlier
Victoria, the beau of a small band of m?
raudere, after committing many atrocitiei
being vigorously chased by a militar
force, made his way across the Mexicai
border and is now- on foreign soil.
While these occurrences, in which
comparatively small numbeatof Indian
were engaged, are most depiorablo, a vas
majority ot our Indian population hav
fully justified the expectations of tlios
who believe that by humane and peacufu
influences the Indian can be led to abac
don the habits of savage lile and to devel
op a capacity for useful and civilued occu
patioiiB. ? nat tuey nave already aucoin
piished in the pursuit of agriculture am
mechanical work, the remarkablo succea
which liaa attended tho experiment o
employing aa froightera a class of Indian
hitherto counted among the wildest am
moat intractable, and the general and ui
gent desire expressed by tbein for the ed
tication of their children, may be taken a
sufficient proof that they will be founi
capable of accomplishing much more i
they continue to be wisely and faithfulii
guided. The "Indian policy" sketched ii
tho report of tlioSecretary of the Interior
tho object of which is to mako libera
provision for the education of Indiai
vouth, to nettle the Indians upon farm lot
iu severalty, to give them title in fee ti
their farms, inalienable for a certain num
ber of years, and when their wants an
thus provided for to dispose by sale of tin
lands on their reservations not occupici
and used by them, a fund to be formei
out of the proceeds for the benetit of th
Indians, who will gradually relieve th
Government of the expenses now providei
fjr by annual appropriations, must com
mend ilaelf as iuat and beneficial in 111
Indians, aud ?e also calculated toremovi
thane obstructions which the existence o
largo reservations presents to the settle
uient and development ol the countrv.
therefore earnestly recommend tlie enact
ment of a lav enabling the Governmen
to give Indians a title in fee, inalienabli
for twenty-five yean, to the farm-landi
assigned to thein by allotment. 1 also re
peat the recommendation made In my Orsi
annual message, that a law be passed ad
milting Indians who can give satisfactory
proof of having, by their own labor, sup*
ported their families for a number ol
years, and who are willing to delach them
solves from thoir tribal relations, to the
benefit of the homestead act, and to gram
them patents containing the same provisional
inalienability for a certain period.
The experiment of sending a number
of Indian children, of both sexes, to the
Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute,
in Virginia, to receive an elementary
English education and practical instruction
in farming aud other useful industries,
has led to results so promising,
that it was thought expedient to turn
over the cavalry barracks at Carlisle, in
Pennsylvania, to the Interior Department
#
i for the establishment o! an Indian icho
i on a larger scale. Ibis school has no
ono hundred and fifty-eight pupils, i
: lected from various tribes, and la In fi
operation. Arrangements are alao ma'
I for the education of a number of InilL
' boys and girls belonging to tribes on t
i Pacific slope, In a similar manner,
i Koiest Grove, In Oregon. These Instil
i tluns will commend themselves to t
' liberality of Congress, and to the pi
lanthroplc munlfcenco of the Amerlc
' people.
I L,?t spring, information wan recelv
' of the organisation of an extensive mot
i ment in the Western States, the obji
t of wjilch was the occupation bv uui
i Ihoriroil persona of certain lands In t
Indlata Territory ceded by the Cheroki
to the Government for the purpose
settlement liy other Indian tribes.
) Un the 29th of April, I issued a proc
mation warning all persons against psrtl
9 pation in such an attempt, and, by the i
I operation of a military force, thelnvasi
t was promptly chocked. It is my purp<
- to protect the rights of the Indian Inha
e tants of that Territory to the full extent
the Executive power. But It wonld
unwise to ignore tho fact that a Territc
so large anil so fertile, with a populat!
. so sparse and with so great a wealth of i
usea resources, will ho found more <
'' posed to the repetition of such attempts
happonod this year, when the surroui
' lug States are more densely settled, a
the westward movement of our pope
lion looks still more eagerly for fresh 1st

' the difficulty of maintaining the Ind
? Territory in Its present state will groa
? Increase, and tl?e Indian tribes Inhabit
? it would do well to prepare for such a b
tingCney. I. theroforo, fully approve

it cultivate, to acquire individual title

benefit. By adopting such a policy tl
' would more certainly securo for tin
i selves the vaiuo ot their possessions, i
at the same time promote their progr
in civilisation and prosperity, than by
, deavoring to perpetuate the present at

Tho iiuestion whether a chango in
'* control of the Indian service should
', made, was in the Forty-fifth Congress
fcrrcd to a joint committee of both Hot
, for inquiry and re|xjrt. In my last ann
j message 1 expressed the hope that
' decision of that question, then in pi
'J pect, "would arrest further agitatior
this subject, such agitation being apl

I vice as well as the Indians tuemselvi
[I Since then, the committee having rep
ed, tho question hss been decided in
' negative by a vote in the House of Re|
' sentatives.
lj For the reasons hore stated, and in v
of the foct that further uncertainty on
" point will be calculated to obstruct ot
l' much needed legislation, to weaken
" difcipline of the service, and to unse
salutary measures now in progress for
government and improvement of the

Top Mill Blast Fubkack.?The accident SI
Jt to the stack of the Top Mill blast furnace
was repaired last week and the drying-out
process having been completed and all 5?
preliminaries arranged, the fires were 1
lighted on Saturday morning at half-past
Is. ten o'clock by Hon. C. 1). Hubbard. Secretary
of the company, and it is expected
that the first cast will be made at U:30 this
w morning. The slacK thus repaired anil w
^ overhauled makes this furnace one of the
best in the State, and one of the most pro- icU
Is* lific. This furnace was built in 1873, and tu
er completed at a time when the financial ac<
panic struck the country in all its force, mi
n thus rendering it practically useless for v#
* the time being, indeed until five years J-0
" afterwards, or until 1878, when it started gj
Ed up and was run very successfully and
satisfactorily for one year, or until the date t5r
ur of the accident which has just been re- f0)
paired. It has a capacity of seventy tons faj
per day and tamed out during the tb
_ time of its operation about 25,000 tons of
E- pig metal. It is built with reference to
*r convenience, and its construction was
superintended by one of the most accomp* j
;er lialied furnace men in the Union, and is 1
ur at present under the management of Jas.
|jj McCune. It has two engines, each hav- .
ing blast cylinders seven feet in diameter f J
and four feet stroke; steam cylinders JJ
36 inches each. The furnace cost when
_ crected from $150,000 to $200,000.
The accident to the stack occurred Oc- ten
tober 2, and has occasioned a loss of two bl(
months in the furnace and?lso about two cu
weeks in tho other departments. ne
? Ore sufiicient to run the furnace until
t uext July was purchased some months ago J
_ at the low rates, and, as their facilities are * j]]
exceptionally good for the procuring of JJ'
coke, no further trouble is anticipated in J i
this branch of the Top Mill.
