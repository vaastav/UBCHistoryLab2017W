Washington, I)pr. President Taft
sent his annual message to congress
today. It is as follows:'
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives:
During the past year the foreign re
lations of the United States have con
tinued upon a basis of friendship and
good understanding.
The year has bepn notable as wit
nessing the pacific settlement of two
Important international controversies
before the permanent court of The
Hague.
The arbitration of the fisheries dis
pute between the United States and
reat Britain, which has been the
source of nearly continuous diplomatic
correspondence since the fisheries con
vention of 1818, has given an award
which is satisfactory to both parties.
This arbitration is particularly note
worthy not only because of the emi
nently just results secured, but also be
cause it is the first arbitration held un
der the general arbitration treaty of
April 4, 1008, between the United
States and Great Britain and disposes
of a controversy the settlement of
which for nearly ninety years has been
the cause of friction between two
countries whose common interest lies
in maintaining the most friendly aud
cordial relations with each other.
The T. niterl States was ably repre
sented before the tribunal. The com
plicated history of the questions aris
ing made the issue depend more than
ordinarily in such cases upon the care
and skill with which our case was
presented, and I should be wanting in
proper recognition of a great patriotic
service if I did not refer to the lucid
historical analysis of the facts and the
signal ability and force of argument—
sis days in length—presented to the
court in support of our case by Sir.
Klihu Boot. As secretary of state Mr.
Root had given close study to the in
tricate facts bearing on the contro
versy and by diplomatic correspond
ence had helped to frame the issues.
At the solicitation of the secretary of
state and myself Mr. Boot, though bur
dened by his duties as senator from
New York, undertook the preparation
of the case as leading counsel, with
the condition imposed by himself that
in view of his position as senator he
should not receive any compensation.
The tribunal constituted at The
Hague by the governments of the Unit
ed States and Venezuela has completed
Its deliberations and has rendered an
award in the case of the Orinoco
Steamship company against Venezuela.
The award may be regarded as satisfac
tory since it has, pursuant to the con
tentions of the United States, recog
nized a number of important principles
making for a judicial attitude in the
determining of international disputes.
In view of grave doubts which had
been raised as to the constitutionality
of The Hague convention for the es
tablishment of an international prize
court, now before the senate for ratifi
cation, because of that provision of the
convention which provides that there
niay be an appeal to the proposed court
from the decisions of national courts,
this government proposed In an Identic
circular note addressed to those powers
which h*l taken part in the London
maritime conference that the powers
signatory to the convention, if con
fronted with such difficulty, might in
sert a reservation to the effect that ap
peals to the international prize court
In respect to decisions of its national
tribunals should take the form of a di
rect claim for compensation, that the
proceedings thereupon to be taken
should be in the form of a trial de novo
and that judgment of the court should
consist of compensation for the illegal
capture Irrespective of the decision of
the national court whose judgment had
thus been internationally liivolved.
As the result of an informal discus
sion it was decided to provide such pro
cedure by means of a separate protocol
which should be ratified at the same
time as the prize court convention it
self.
Accordingly the government of the
Netherlands at the request of this gov
ernment proposed under date of May
24, 1910, to the powers signatory to
The Hague convention the negotiation
of a supplemental protocol embodying
stipulations providing for this alterna-
I tivc procedure. It Is gratifying to ob
icrve that this additional protocol is
being signed without objection by the
powers signatory to the original con
vention aud that there is every reason
to believe that the international prize
court will be soon established.
The identic circular note also pro
posed that the international prize court
when established should be endowed
with the functions of an arbitral court
of justice under and pursuant to the
recommendation adopted by the last
Hague conference. The replies receiv
ed from the various powers to this pro
posal inspire the hope that this also
may be accomplished within the rea
sonably near future.
It is believed that the establishment
of these two tribunals will go a long
way toward securing the arbitration of
many questions which have heretofore
threatened and at times destroyed the
peace of nations.
TO APPOINT PEACE COMMIS
SIONERS.
President Is Waiting For Expres
sions From Foreign Powers.
Appreciating these enlightened tend
encies of modern times, the congress
at its last session passed a law provid
ing for the appointment, of a commis
sion of live members "to be appointed
by the president, of the United States
to consider the expediency of utilizing
existing international agencies for the
purpose of limiting the armaments of
the nations of the world by interna
tional agreement and of constituting
the combined navies of the world an
international force for the preserva
tion of universal peace and to consider
and report upon any other means to
diminish the expenditures of govern
ment for military purposes and to
lessen the probabilities of war."
I have not as yet made appointments
to this commission because I have in
vited and am awaiting the expressions
of foreign governments as to their will
ingness to co-operate with us in the
appointment of similar commissions or
representatives who would meet with
our commissioners and by joint action
seek to make their work effective.
Europe, Canada, Etc.
Several important treaties have been
negotiated with Great Britain in the
past twelve months. A preliminary
diplomatic agreement has been reach
ed regarding the arbitration of pecu
niary claims which each government
has artinst the other. This agree
ment, with the schedules of claims
annexed, will, as soon as the schedules
are arranged, bo submitted to the sen
ate for npproval.
An agreement between the United
States and Great Britain with regard
to the location of the international
boundary line between the United
States and Canada in Passamaquoddy
bay and to the middle of Grand Mn
han channet was reached in a treaty
concluded Slay 21. 1010. which has
been ratified by both governments and
proclaimed, thus making unnecessary
the arbitration provided for in the
previous treaty of April 11, 1008.
The convention concluded Jan. 11,
1000, between the United States and
Great Britain providing for the settle
ment of international differences be
tween the United States and Canada,
including the apportionment between
the two countries of certain of the
boundary waters and the appointment
of commissioners to adjust certain oth
er questions, has been ratified by both
governments and proclaimed.
The work of the international fish
eries commission appointed In 1908,
under the treaty of April 1J, 1008, be
tween Great Britain and the TTnited
States has resulted in the formulation
and recommendation of uniform regu
lations governing the fisheries of the
boundary waters of Canada and the
United States for the purpose of pro
tecting and increasing the supply of
food fish In such waters. In comple
tion of this work the regulations
agreed upon require congressional leg
islation to make them effective and
for their enforcement in fulfillment of
the treaty stipulations.
OVERTHROW OF KING MANOEL
United States Recognized Portugal
Provisional Republic.
In October last the monarchy in
Portugal was overthrown, a provision
al republic was proclaimed, and there
was set up a de facto government
which was promptly recognized by the
government of the United States for
purposes of ordinary Intercourse pend
ing formal recognition by this and oth
er powers of the governmental entity
to be duly established by the national
sovereignty.
Liberia.
A disturbance among the native
tribes of Liberia in a portion of the re
public during the early part of this
year resulted in the sending under the
treaty of 1862 of an American vessel
of war to the disaffected district, and
the Llberian authorities, assisted by
the good offices of the American naval
officers, were able to restore order.
The negotiations which have been un
dertaken for the amelioration of the
conditions found in Liberia by the
American commission, whose report I
transmitted to congress on March 25
last, are being brought to conclusion,
and it is thought that within a short
time practical measures of relief may
be put into effect through the good of
fices of this government and the cor
dial co-operation of other governments
interested in Liberia's welfare.
The Near East—Turkey.
To return the visit of the special em
bassy sent to announce the accession
of his majesty Mehemet V., emperor
of the Ottomans, I sent to Constanti
nople a special ambassador, who, In
addition to this mission of ceremony,
was charged with the duty of express
ing to the Ottoman government the
value attached by the government of
the United States to Increased and
more important relations between the
countries and the desire of the United
States to contribute to the larger eco
nomic md commercial development
due to the new regime in Turkey.
The rapid development now begin
ning in that ancient empire and the
marked progress and increased com
mercial importance of Bulgaria, Iiou
mnnia and Sen-la make it particularly
opportune that the possibilities of
American commerce in the near east
should receive due attention.
Montenegro.
The national skoupchtina having ex
pressed its will that the principality of
Montenegro be raised to the rank of
kingdom, the Prince of Montenegro on
Aug. lf» last assumed the title of king
of Montenegro. It gave me pleasure
to accord to the new kingdom the rec
ognition of the United States.
The Far East.
The center of interest in far eastern
affairs during the past year has again
been China.
It is gratifying to note that the ne
gotiations for a loan to the Chinese
government for the construction of
the trunk railway lines from Hankow
southward to Canton and westward
through the Yangtse valley, known us
the Hukuang loan, were concluded by
the representatives of the various
financial groups in May last and the
results approved by their respective
governments. The agreement, already
initialed by the Chinese government, is
now awaiting formal ratification.. The
basis of the settlement of the terms of
this loan was one of exact equality be
tween America, Great Britain, France
and Germany in respect to financing
the loan and supplying materials for
the proposed railways and their future
branches.
The application of the principle un
derlying the policy of the United States
in regard to the Hukuang loan—viz,
that of the internationalization of the
foreign interest in such of the railways
of China as may be financed by for
eign countries—was suggested on a
broader scale by the secretary of state
in a proposal for internationalization
and commercial neutralization of all
the railways of Manchuria. While the
principle which led to the proposal of
this government was generally admit
ted by the powers to whom it was ad
dressed, the governments of Russia and
Japan apprehended practical difficul
ties in the execution of the larger plan
which prevented their ready adher
ence. The question of constructing the
Chinchow-Aigun railway by means of
an international loan to China is, how
ever, still the subject of friendly dis
cussion by the interested parties.
The policy of this government In
these matters has been directed by a
desire to make the use of American
capital in the development of China an
instrument in the promotion of China's
welfare and material prosperity with
out prejudice to her legitimate rights
as nn independent political power.
This policy has recently found fur
ther exemplification in the assistance
given by this government to the nego
tiations between China and a group of
American bankers for a loan of $50,
000.000 to be employed chiefly in cur
rency reform. The confusion which
has from ancient times existed in the
monetary usages of the Chinese lias
been one of the principal obstacles to
commercial intercourse with that peo
ple.
The United States in its treaty of
1903 with China obtained a pledge
from the latter to introduce a uniform
national coinage, and the following
year, at the request of China, this gov
ernment sent to Peking a member of
the international exchange commission
to discuss with the Chinese govern
ment the best methods of introducing
the reform. In 1908 China sent a com
missioner to the United States to con
sult with American financiers as to the
possibility of securing a large loan
with which to inaugurate the new cur
rency system, but the death of their
majesties the empress dowager and the
emperor of China interrupted the ne
gotiations, which were not resumed un
til a few months ago. when this gov
ernment was asked to communicate to
the bankers concerned the request of
China for a loan of $50,000,000 for the
purpose under review. A preliminary
agreement between the American group
and China has becu made covering the
loan.
For the success of this loan and the
contemplated reforms which are of the
greatest Importance to the commercial
interests of the United States and the
civilized world at large It Is realized
that an expert will be necessary, and
this government has received assur
ances from China that such an advis
er, who shall be an American, will be
engaged.
It is a matter of interest to Ameri
cans to note the success which Is at
tending the efforts of China to estab
lish gradually a system of .representa
tive government. The provincial as
semblies were opened in October,
1909, and in October of the present
year a consultative body, the nucleus
of the future national parliament, held
its first session at Peking.
The year has further been marked
by two important international agree
ments relating to far eastern affaire.
In the Russo-Japanese agreement re
lating to Manchuria, signed July 4,
1910, this government was gratified
to note an assurance of continued
peaceful conditions In that region and
the reaffirmation of the policies with
respect to China to which the United
States together with all other Inter
ested powers are alike solemnly com
mitted.
The treaty annexing Korea to the
empire of Japan, promulgated Aug.
29, 1910, marks the final step In a
process of control of the apclent em
pire by her powerful neighbor that has
been in progress for several years past
In communicating the fact of annexa
tion the Japanese government gave to
the government of the United States
assurances of the full protection of
the rights of American citizens in Ko
rea under the changed conditions.
Friendly visits of many distinguish
ed persons from the far east have been
made during the year. Chief among
these were their imperial highnesses
Princes Tsal-tao and Tsal-Hsun of
China and his imperial highness
Prince Hignshl Ftishlmi and Prince
Toktigawa, president of the house of
peers of Japan. The secretary of war
has recently visited Japan and China
in connection with bis tour to the
Philippines, and a large delegation of
American business men are at present
traveling in China. This exchange of
friendly visits has had the happy ef
fect of even further strengthening our
friendly international relations.
TROUBLES OF LATIN AMERICA.
We Are at Peace, but War Bothers
Southern Republics.
During the past year several of our
southern sister republics celebrated
the one hundredth anniversary of their
independence. In honor of these
events special embassies were sent
from this country to Argentina, Chile
and Mexico, where the gracious re
ception and splendid hospitality ex
tended them manifested the cordial
relations and friendship existing be
tween those countries and the United
States, relations which I am happy to
believe have never before been upon
so high a plane and so solid a basis as
at present.
The congressional commission ap
pointed under a concurrent resolution
to atteud the festivities celebrating the
centennial anniversary of Mexican
independence, together with a special
ambassador, were received with the
highest honors and with the greatest
cordiality and returned with the report
of the bounteous hospitality and warm
reception of President Diaz and the
Mexican people, which left no doubt of
the desire of. the immediately neigh
boring republic to continue the mutual
ly beneficial and intimate relations
which I feel sure the two governments
will ever cherish.
At the fourth pan-American confer
ence, which met in Buenos Aires dur
ing July and August last, after seven
weeks of harmonious deliberation
three conventions were signed provid
ing for the regulation of trademarks,
patents and copyrights, which, when
ratified by the different governments,
will go far toward furnishing to Amer
ican authors,, patentees and owners of
trademarks fhe protection needed in
localities where heretofore it has been
either lacking or inadequate. Further,
a convention for the arbitration of
pecuniary claims was signed and a
number of important resolutions pass
ed. The conventions will in due
course be transmitted to the senate,
and the report of the delegation of the
United States will be communicated to
the congress for its information. The
special cordiality between representa
tive men from all parts of America
which was shown at this conference
cannot fail to react upon and draw
still closer the relations between the
countries which took part In it.
The international bureau of Ameri
can republics is doing a broad and use
ful work for pan-American commerce
and comity. Its duties were much en
larged by the international conference
of American states at Buenos Aires,
and its name was shortened to the
more practical and expressive term of
pan-American union. Located now in
its new building, which was specially
dedicated April 26 of this year to the
development of friendship, trade and
peace among the American nations, it
has improved instrumentalities to serve
the twenty-two republics of this hem
isphere.
I am glad to say that the action of
the United States in its desire to re
move imminent danger of war between
Peru and Ecuador growing out of a
boundary dispute, with the co-opera
tion «of Brazil and the Argentiue Re
public as joint mediators with this gov
ernment, has already resulted success
fully In preventing war. The govern
ment of Chile, while not one of the
mediators, lent effective aid in further
ance of a preliminary agreement likely
to lead on to an amicable settlement,
and it is not doubted that the good
offices of the mediating powers and the
conciliatory co-operation of the govern
ments directly interested will finally
lead to a removal of this perennial
cause of friction between Ecuador and
Peru. The inestimable value of cordial
co-operation between the sister repub
lics of America for the maintenance
of peace in this hemisphere has never
been more clearly shown than in this
mediation, b% which three American
governments have given to this hemis
phere the honor of first Invoking the
most farreachlng provisions of The
Hague convention for the pacific set
tlement of International disputes.
There has been signed by the repre
sentatives of the United States and
Mexico a protocol submitting to the
United States-Mexican boundary com
mission (whose membership for the
purpose of this case Is to be increased
by the addition of a citizen of Can
ada) the question of sovereignty over
the Chamlzal tract, which lies within
the present physical boundaries of the
city of El Paso,. Tex. The determina
tion of this question will remove a
source of no .little annoyance to the
two governments.
The republic of Honduras has for
many years been burdened with a
wmmmmm
heavy tailed debt held in Europe, the
Interest on which long ago fell In ar
rears. Finally conditions were such
that It became imperative to refund
the debt and place the finances of the
republic upon a sound basis. Last
year a group of American bankers un
dertook to do this and to advance
funds for railway and other Improve
ments contributing directly to the
country's prosperity and commerce—an
arrangement which has long been de
sired by this government. Negotiations
to this end have been under way for
more than a year, and it Is now confi
dently believed that a short time will
suffice to conclude an arrangement
which will be satisfactory to the for
eign creditors, eminently advantageous
to Honduras and highly creditable to
the judgment and foresight of the
Honduranean government. This is
much to be desired since, as recognized
by the Washington conventions, a
strong Honduras would tend immense
ly to the progress and prosperity of
Central America.
During the past year the republic of
Nicaragua has been the scene of In
ternecine struggle. General Zelaya,
for seventeen years the absolute ruler
o* Nicaragua, was throughout his ca
reer he disturber of Central America
and opposed every plan for the pro
motion of peace and friendly relations
betweeu the five republics.
When the people of Nicaragua were
finally driven into rebellion by his law
less exactions he violated the laws of
war by the unwarranted execution of
two American citizens who had regu
larly enlisted In the ranks of the rev
olutionists. This and other offenses
made it the duty of the American gov
ernment to take measures with a view
to ultimate reparation and for the
safeguarding of its interests.
This involved the breaking off o: all
diplomatic relations with the Zelaya
government for^the reasons laid down
in a communication from the secretary
of state, which also notified the con
tending factions in Nicaragua that this
government would hold each to strict
accountability for outrages on the
rights of American citizens. American
forces were sent to both coasts of Ni
caragua to be in readiness should oc
casion arise to protect Americans and
their interests and remained there un
til the war was over and peace had
returned to that unfortunate country.
These events, together with Zelaya's
continued exactions, brought him so
clearly to the bar of public opinion
that he was forced to resign and to
take refuge abroad.
In the above mentioned communica
tion of the secretary of state to the
charge d'affaires of the Zelaya govern
ment the opinion was expressed that
the revolution represented the wishes
of the majority of the Nicaraguan peo
ple. This has now been proved beyond
doubt by the fact that since the com
plete overthrow of the Madriz govern
ment and the occupation of the capital
by the forces of the revolution all fac
tions have united to maintain public or
der, and as a result of discussion with an
agent of this government sent to Ma
nagua at the request of the provisional
government comprehensive plans are
being made for the future welfare of
Nicaragua, including the rehabilitation
of public credit. The moderation and
conciliatory spirit shown by the vari
ous factions give ground for the con
fident hope that Nicaragua will soon
take its rightful place among the law
abiding and progressive countries of
the world.
It gratifies me exceedingly to an
nounce that the Argentine Republic
some months ago placed with American
manufacturers a contract for the con
struction of two battleships and certain
additional naval equipment. The ex
tent of this work aud Its importance to
the Argentine Republic make the, plac
ing of the bid an earnest of friendly
feeling toward the United States.
Tariff Negotiations.
The new tariff law in section 2 re
specting the maximum and minimum
tariffs of the United States, which pro
visions came into effect on April 1,
1910, imposed upon the president the
responsibility of determining prior to
that date whether or not any undue
discrimination existed against the Unit
ed States and its products In any coun
try of the world with which we sus
tained commercial relations.
Iu the case of several countries in
stances of apparent undue discrimina
tion against American commerce were
found to exist. These discriminations
were removed by negotiation. Prior
to April 1, 1910, when the maximum
tariff was to come into operation with
respect to importations from all those
countries In whose favor no proclama
tion applying the minimum tariff
should be issued by the president, 134
such proclamations were issued. This
series of proclamations embraced the
entire commercial world, and hence
the minimum tariff of the United
States has been given universal appli
cation, thus testifying to the satisfac
tory character of our trade relations
with foreign countries.
Marked advantages to the commerce
of the United States were obtained
through these tariff settlements. For
eign nations are fully cognizant of the
fact that under section 2 of the tariff
act the president is required, when
ever he is satisfied that the treat
ment accorded by them to the prod
ucts of the United States is not such
as to entitle them to the benefits of the
minimum tariff of the United States,
to withdraw those benefits by procla
mation, giving ninety days' notice,
after which the maximum tariff will
apply to their dutiable products enter
ing the United States. In its general
operation this section of the tariff law
has thus far proved a guaranty of
continued commercial peace, although
there are, however, unfortunately In
stances where foreign governments
deal arbitrarily with American Inter
ests within their jurisdiction In a man
ner injurious and inequitable.
The policy of broader and closer
trad* relations with the Dominion of
Canada which was Initiated in the ad
justment of the maximum and mini
mum provisions of the tariff act of
August, 1909, has proved mutually
beneficial. It Justifies further efforts
for the readjustment of the commer
cial relations of the two countries so
that their commerce may follow the
channels natural to contiguous coun
tries and be commensurate with the
steady expansion of trade and indus
try on both sides of the boundary line.
The reciprocation on the part of the
Dominion government of the sentiment
which was expressed by this govern
ment was followed in October by t#ie
suggestion that It would be glad'to
have the negotiations which had been
temporarily suspended during the sum
mer resumed. In accordance with this
suggestion the secretary of state by
my direction dispatched two represent
atives of the department of state as
special commissioners to Ottawa to
confer with representatives of the Do
minion government. They were au
thorized to take such steps for formu
lating a reciprocal trade agreement as
might be necessary and to receive and
consider any propositions which the
Dominion government might care to
submit.
Pursuant to the instructions Issued
conferences were held by these com
missioners with officials of the Domin
ion government at Ottawa in the early
part of November.
The negotiations were conducted on
both sides in a spirit of mutual accom
modation. The discussion of the com
mon commercial interests of the two
countries had for its object a satisfac
tory basis for a trade arrangement
which offers the prospect of a freer in
terchange for the products of the Unit
ed States and of Canada. The confer
ences were adjourned to be resumed in
Washington in January, when It Is
hoped that the aspiration of both gov
ernments for a mutually advantageous
measure of reciprocity will be realized.
THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE.
Foreign Trade Is Improving—Mer
chant Marine Development.
All these tariff negotiations, so vital
to our commerce and industry, and the
duty of jealousy guarding the equi
table and just treatment of our prod
ucts, capital and industry abroad de
volve upon the department of state.
The Argentine battleship contracts,
like the subsequent important one for
Argentine railway equipment and those
for Cuban government vessels, were
secured for our manufacturers largely
through the good offices of the depart
ment of state.
The efforts of that department to se
cure for citizens of the United States
equal opportunities in the markets of
the world and to expand American
commerce have been most succcssful.
The volume of business obtained in
new fields of competition and upon
new lines is already very great, and
congress is nrged to continue to- sup
port the department of state In its en
deavors for further trade expansion.
Our foreign trade merits the best
support of the government and the
most earnest endeavor of our manu
facturers and merchants, who, if they
do not already in all cases need a for
eign market, are' certain soon to be-
come dependent on it. Therefore, now
Is the time to secure a strong position
in this field.
I cannot leave this subject without
emphasizing the necessity of such leg
islation as will make possible and con
venient the establishment of American
banks and branches of American banks
In foreign countries. Only by such
means can our foreign trade be favor
ably financed, necessary credits be ar
ranged and proper avail be made of
commercial opportunities in foreign
countries, and most especially in Latin
America.
Another instrumentality indispensa
ble to the uiihampered and natural de
velopment of American commerce is
merchant marine. All maritime and
commercial nations recognize the im
portance of this factor. The greatest
commercial nations, our competitors,
jealously foster their merchant ma
rine. Perhaps nowhere Is the need for
rapid and direct mail, passenger and
freight communication quite so urgent
as between the United States and
Latin America. We can secure in no
other quarter of the world such imm»_
dlate benefits in friendship and com
merce as would flow from the estab
lishment of direct lines of communica
tion with the countries of "Latin Amer
ica adequate to meet the requirements
of a rapidly increasing appreciation of
the reciprocal dependence of the coun
tries of the western hemisphere upon
each other's products, sympathies and
assistance.
I alluded to this most Important sub
ject in my last annual message. It has
often been before you, and I need not
recapitulate the reasons for Its recom
mendation. Unless prompt action be
taken the completion of the Panama
canal will find this the only great
commercial nation unable to avail in
International maritime business of this
great contribution to the means of the
world's commercial Intercourse.
Quite aside from the commercial as
pect, unless we create a
m«rnhHnt ma
rine where can we find the seafaring
population necessary as a natural na
val reserve and where could we find,
In case of war, the transports and sub
sidiary vessels without which a naval
fleet Is arms without a body? For
many reasons I cannot too strongly
urge upon the congress the passage of
a measure by mail subsidy or other
subvention adequate to guarantee the
establishment and rapid development
of an American merchant marine* the
restoration of the American flag to Its
ancient place upon the seas.
With our increasing international in­
rr--
tercourse it becomes Incumbent upon
me to repeat more emphatically than
ever the recommendation which I
made In my Inaugural address that
congress shall at once give to the
courts of the United States jurisdic
tion to punish as a crime the violation
of the rights of aliens secured by trea
ty with the United States in order that
the general government of the United
States shall be able when called upon
by a friendly nation to redeem its
solemn promise by treaty to secure to
the citizens or subjects of that nation
resident in .the United States freedom
from violence and due process of law
In respect to their life, liberty and
property.
I also and for the same general rea
sons strongly commend to the favora
ble action of the congress the enact
ment of a law applying to the diplo
matic and consular service the princi
ples embodied in section 1753 of the
Revised Statutes of the United States,
In the civil service act of Jan. 16, 1888,
and the executive orders of June 17,
1906, and of Nov. 26,1909.
The excellent results which have at
tended the partial application of civil
service principles to the diplomatic and
consular services are an earnest of the
bepefit to be wrought to both branches
of the foreign service. The marked
improvement in the consular service
during the four years since the prin
ciples of the civil service act were ap
plied to that service in a limited way
and the good results already notice
able from a similar application of civil
service principles to the diplomatic
service a year ago convince me that
the enactment Into law of the general
principles of the existing executive reg
ulations could not fall to effect further
improvement of both branches of the
foreign service, offering as it would
by its assurance of permanency of
tenure and promotion on merit an in
ducement for the entry of capable
young men into the service and *an In
centive to those already in to put forth
their best efforts to attain and main
tain that degree of efficiency which the
Interests of our international relations
and commerce demand.
During many years past appeals have
been made from time to time to con
gress In favor of government owner
ship of embassy and legation premises
abroad. The arguments, in favor of
such ownership have been many and
oft repeated and are well known to
the congress. The acquisition by the
government of suitable residences and
offices for its diplomatic officers, espe
cially in the capitals of the Latin Amer
ican states and of Europe, is so impor
tant and necessary to an improved
diplomatic service that I have no hesi
tation in urging upon the congress the
passage of some measure similar to
that favorably reported by the house
committee on foreign affairs on Feb.
14, 1910 (report No. 438), that would
authorize, the gradual and annual ac
quisition of premises for diplomatic
use.
The work of the diplomatic service It
devoid of partisanship. Its Important
should appeal to every American citi
zen and should receive the generoui
consideration of the congress.
TREASURY DEPARTMENT.
Estimates For Next Year's Expenses.
Where Savings Have Been Made.
Every effort has been made by each
department chief to reduce the esti
mated cost of his department for the
ensuing fiscal year ending June 80,
1912. I say this in order that congress
may understand that these estimates
thus made present the smallest sum
which will maintain the departments,
bureaus and offices of the government
and meet its other obligations under
existing law and that a cut of these
estimates would result In embarrassing
the executive branch of. the govern
ment in the performance of Its duties.
This remark does not apply to the
river and harbor estimates, except to
those for expenses of maintenance and
the meeting of obligations under au
thorized contracts, nor does it apply
to the public building bill nor to the
navy building program. Of course as
to these congress could withhold any
part or all of the estimates for them
without interfering with the discharge
of the ordinary obligations of the gov
ernment or the performance of the
functions of its departments, bureaus
and offices.
The final estimates for the year aid
ing June 30, 1912, as they have been
sent to the treasury on Nov. 29 of this
year for the ordinary expenses of the
government, Including those for public
buildings, rivers and harbors and the
navy building program, amount to $680,
494,013.12. This is $52,964,887.86 less
than the appropriations for the fiscal
year ending June 80, 1911. It is $16,
883,153.44 less than the total estimates,
Including supplemental estimates sub
mitted to congress by the treasury for
the year 1911, and Is $5,574,659.89 less
than the original estimates submitted
by the treasury for 1911.
These figures do not Include the ap
propriations for the Panama the
policy In respect to which ought to be
and is to spend as much each year as
can be economically and effectively
expended in order to complete the ca
nal as promptly as possible, and there
fore the ordinary motive for cutting
down the expense of the government
does not apply to appropriations for
this purpose. It wUl be noted that the
estimates for the Panama canal for
the ensuing year are more than $56,
000.000, an Increase of $20,000,000 over
the amount appropriated for this year,
a difference due to the fact that the
estimates for 1912 Include something
over $19,000,000 for the fortification of
the canal.
Against the estimates of expendi
tures, $630,494,013.12. we hav? esti-
