WASHINGTOX. Dec. 3. — The Fifty- j
ninth Congress began its last session!
at noon today. it took the Senate flf- j
teen minutes to arrange its prelim- j
ir.aries and the House an hour. The ]
Senate received from President Roose- J
velt a long list of nominations for Its ]
confirmation, and in executive session j
of nineteen minutes decided, as the i
nominations had been received before
the body had been organized formally, I
to make no confirmations until the !
President's annual message had been i
received and the session fairly started. I
Senators Penrose of Pennsylvania and ;
Foraker of Ohio came forward with j
resolutions of inquiry regarding the j
discharge of the negro troops of the ;
Twenty- fifth Infantry. One was ad- ;
dressed to the President and the other ;
to the Secretary of War. After the j
ripple of surprise had passed and j
Vice President Fairbanks had suggest- '
ed that it was unusual to transact any '
business until the President's message j
had been received, the resolutions went
over by unanimous consent. Senator
Dupont of Delaware took the oath of j
office. The opening of the two house* j
«as witnessed by an animated throng j
which filled the galleries to their ca- j
jpacitjv ":. Hundreds went away dlsap- \
pointed in not gaining admittance to j
witness the session of either Senate J.
or House. ;
MAXV .\E\V MEMBERS
Not in years has a larger number of j
members-elect of the lower house of i
Congress appeared at the Speaker's J
desk to take the oath of offlce. Death \u25a0
\u25a0was unusually active among the mem- '
bership during the closing days of the j
last session and the beginning of the j
present, and Chaplain Couden feelingly j
called the attention of the body to the |
work of the grim reaper during the
months since adjournment.
h'peaker Cannon appointed Repre- j
sentative James R. Mann of Illinois
cs a member of the Board of Regents i
of the Smithsonian Institution, vice j
liobett R- Hitt of Illinois, deceased.
The galleries of the House were j
crowded at an early hour. The ab- !
sence of flowers from the desks of the 1
members was much commented on, j
but the order of the Speaker prohibit- j
ing the floral display was generally j
commanded * or its »°od sense. A slm- j
Jlar rule was made in the Senate two'!
years ago. i
Mrs. Nicholas Longworth, daughter j
of the President, occupied a seat in
the executive gallery, accompanied by
Miss Hagner. social secretary to the |
•wife of the President.
COCKRAN IS VERY BUSY
The routine work of the House in- J
cident to the opening day was quickly |
dispatched, the roll call showing near- j
Jy 300 members present. Representa- j
tive Bourke Cockran of Xcw York, who
recently married Mis 3 Ide, was the sub- j
ject of a hearty laugh when his per- !
Eonal request that he be permitted to J
absent himself for an indefinite period
on account of business was laid be- j
fore the House by the Speaker.
After the appointment of the usual j
committee to wait on the President and t
inform him that the House was organ- ;
iz^d and ready to receive any communi- j
ration he might d«sire to make of in-"^
terest to the pubile service, the House ]
adjourned out of respect to the memory j
of the deceased members. ;
President Roosevelt's message Trill
be received both in the House and Sen
ate tomorrow. No bills were intro
duced in the Senate. In the House
th?rc were thirty-eight public meas
ure* and 350 of a private character.
SPELLING TEMPEST THREATENED
The question of spelling will un
doubtedly receive attention at the
hands of Congress this week. The sub
committee of the House committee on
appropriations, which provided the ex
ecutive and Judicial appropriation bill,
will report ;that measure to the full
committee today with the old form of
spollSng retainedand it will be for the
iommitt«v» to decide whether the sim
plified spelling method shall be used.
There is a possibility that the Congres
sional Record will contain both styles
of fsp«?lHng;. Representative Charles

tion, said:

WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. — Nothing
which has been said in the whole range
of comment on the possibility of war
between the United States and Japan
has j surprised certain "Washington offi
cials so much as the seeming unanimity,
"of opinion ~4n the, country that t w^ are
utterly unprepared for a tight wit|* the
Orientals..
,There ; is ar prayerful hepe_ that no war!
will icome, but^. if it- should .comef.the i
strong probabilities are that the pessi- j
•lists, '\u25a0? and they seem to/ abound ;in j
every section of the land^' .will find that
they have looked upon the prospect
through blue glasses.
This nation is' not entirely unpre
pared for hostilities with Japan or any
j other country. There iS only one na
jtion-that can crush our sea fleets/and
)'\\. vs>aHorB of 'that nation would know
[•ihs.'Sthey . had ' been in a fight before

|: J |^ FEAR FOR PHILIPPINES
< J^dngressmcn have come to "Washing-!
I i*r - - - - \u25a0 \u25a0 -
cjvii from every district and all of them
seem burdened .with* the belief that if
trouble comes with Japan over the
California school question, which is a
minor matter, or over the enactment
of a Japanese exclusion law, which is
a major matter, the Philippines will
be lost to us, temporarily at least,
within a month.
The press of the United States
sounds the same dismal - note. The
Japanese would overrun the Philip
pines, drive our forces helter-skelter
into the rice fields until, after months
and possibly years, we have rebuilt —
doubly rebuilt — the fleets which Togo
or some other Oriental admiral has
given to Davy Jones.
Officers of the United States army
and navy whose duties lie along cer
tain lines of preparation are not idle
.in time of peace. If Japan declared war
tomorrow the chiefs of the twin Ameri
can services would know how to meet
her armies and her fleet, with more
than an even chance that the apparent
ly expected Oriental successes would
prove to be' reverses.
SETTLEMENT IS ASSURED
A satisfactory adjustment of the
trouble between the United States and
Japan growing out of the action of the
authorities of San francisco in exclud
ing: Japanese, children- from the white
schools of that city will be brought
about, according: to" the views of Presi
dent- Roosevelt, the members of his
Cabinet and many members of the Sen
ate and Housed Few officials in Wash
ington now believe that there will be
an armed conflict over this question or
that commercial warfare will be the
outcome of the trouble. .
, Secretary Root received today from
Henry :B. Miller, the American Consul
General at Yokohama.v Japan, a denial
of' the interview .in ,\u25a0 . which \- he \u25a0 was
quoted as saying that war is;lnevitable
between Japan' and the United States,
owing to the school question. 'i It .has
been communicated to Japan/ and , has
tended to i.romote a better feeling be
tween the two countries.
Presiden t';Roosevel t 1 had ' a number/of
conferences today- with Senators and
Representatives. Half of .them 'ex
pressed ' the belief that ; the trouble
would be settled amicably. The" Japan-?

Whether. Chief of Police Dinan

be decided, by the Police Commis
sioners this evening.]: Although
Ruef ism favor of, retaining Dinah
at the head of the Police Depart
ment while the graft investiga
tion continues and using his in
fluence to aid in the defense of the
indicted, a disposition became ap
parent yesterday among the Po
lice Commissioners to exercise
precaution in "dealing with the
case of the discredited chief.
vßuef 's commissioners on the
board even went, so far as to au
thorize the statement; that they would

It Is pointed out that Commissioner
Creswell is in a position to decide on
the matter much-, better than ; them

coupled with his past experience as
City "Attorney, qualifying him to speak
authoritatively ron it. l from a legal
standpoint Whether, tliey will adhere
to Cresweli's- opinion in the matter,'
however, -remains. to be seen.
When- questioned last- night concern-,
ing Dinan's status while under In
dictment, Commissioner Creswell ex
cused himself 'from a direct r«ply.
"I have not gone Into this matter, as
fully as I shouldMikeLto." he said, "and
do not care to discuss _if as yet. I
shall probably; bef.ready. to denneVthe

WHERE THEY,. AI'PEARED YESTERDAY TO ANSWER CHARGES OK EXTORTION.
Mayor to Appear With His Attorneys
and Ask for Separate Trial
Mayor Schmitz and Abe Ruef appeared in Judge Dunne's court
yesterday morning to answer to the charge of having extorted money
from French restaurants. -Keither, was prepared to plead, and the
cases were put over until Thursday morning at 10 o'clock. Schmitz
will demand ;a" separate trial, and has retained counsel. The law
firm of Campbell; Metsori & IDrew and Attorney John J. Barrett will
defend : the' -Mayor. Frank Drew, and Barrett have assumed control
of; the case. "" : .
From the outset it became evident that both Schmitz and Ruef
had resolved upon a bold scheme of obstruction. \ In asking for a
postppnemeht the attorneys for the /defense were careful to state
that they desired more time "to answer the indictment." Heney was
quick, to perceive the distinction, and inquired whether, "to answer
the meant to plead. JHewas informed by the defense
thattoanswer.the indictment meant either .to' move to set the Jn
dictmentaside,:to demur or to plead. "It'is understood that Schmitz
and Ruef will ' begin their defense with attacks on the: indictment.
The status "of \u25a0 the" Grand Jury will- be
questioned, intimidation' , of -witnesses
charged and other devices invoked
which make, for delay. They figure
that they will thus be able to delay
their cases/and block >\u25a0 the \u25a0' Grand;' Jury
at the same : time. \u25a0.'-.'. Members of ; the
Grand Jury will be called into court

HER STAR
Antioch Woman Finances
a Restaurant Deal and
Now Expresses Regret.
MANAGER VANISHES
AND DEBTS REMAIN
He Wins the Maid of His
Benefactress as Well as
Coin She Had Saved
A woman is now In control of
"Bab's" Grill at 1715 Geary street, and
it is claimed by those who are familiar
with the vicissitudes of the establish^
ment that she o«ly took over the place
when Jackson Sutton, late owner, def
camped after having secured $3000 of
her money. This determined feminine
party of the first part is said to be
Mrs. Christina Bonneckson of Antioch.
Her attorneys are Sullivan. Sullivan &
Roach.
Sutton is said to have played upon
the weaknesses of Mrs. Bonneckson for
the purpose of getting possession of
her savings. The story is that he
called her endearing names while at
the same time slyly making love to
Anna Nelson, a Danish girl who
worked for Mrs. Bonneckson at Aii
tioch.
'£ Two months ago Sutton left Antioch
with $3500, said to have been secured
from his patroness, and with the pretty
little Danish girl he came to this city.
The pair took apartments at 1732 Geary
street, opposite Bab's restaurant, which'
Sutton bought and placed under the
management of the former owner. Bab
cock. , It .was presumed then that Sut
ton * and 1 the ; Nelson girl iWecauKWrr!*"*.,
he having always Introduced her as his
wife. •"'\u25a0->
. Sutton secured the first installment
of the 'Antioch woman's money by say
ing that he intended to open a saloon
on Post street, near Fillmore. Then he
changed his plans end put the funds
into the eating place at 1715 Geary
street. Since the trouble a Dane named
Raubach is in charge as manager for
Mrs. Eonneekson and he tells how he
secured \u25a0 possession of the place. He
says the first installment secured from
Mrs. Boneckson was not enough for
Sutton. He had to buy jewel 3 for his
alleged wife and he had to keep "Bab's"
name burning electrically over the
door of the restaurant. On November
24 he made a trip to Antioch and re
turned with $1500 secured from his
friend. Mrs. Bonneckson did not know
of Sutton's doings h»?re and she will
ingly advanced him fund 3.
Sutton's la3t "money-raising trip to
Antioch was on a Sunday. Soon there
after he and the girl left their lodg
ings with all their effects. Inquiry
there last evening met with the sug
gestion that they might have gone to
Portland.
On the following Thursday, Thanks
giving Day, the Antioch benefactress
came to the city, but- not finding Sut
ton, she hired a detective to trace him.
But" her selection of a detective, was
not entirely a happy one. for the detec
tive. James Curtin. took art overdo3o
of morphine Sunday night last,! was
taken to the Central Emergency Hos
pital, and the story leaked oat. " Tha
woman saya that she does not wish to
prosecute Suttoik but she would, like
to.flnd out.'vuhere he is. Yesterday she
came to the city with a draft, which
she cashed at the Swis3-American
Bank. She paid a bill for the restaur
rant to Bartlett & Requa. dealers in
wines at 1274 Eddy street.
* Raubach. manager of the ffrtll.' said
last night that he saw an advertise
ment in a paper calling for" 'a
manager for the place, and when
he applied he. was immediately en*
gaged. It Is said that Raubach was
hired by.Sutton a short time before his
disappearance and that now he is re
tained In his position by the Antioch
woman.
