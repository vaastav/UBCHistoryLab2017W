Some Admire It and Some Don't—Usu­
ally Conceded to Be a Fair
Document.
Chilian's Highly Displeased and Said
to Be Hiking Active Prepara­
tions for War.
NEW YORK. Dec. 11.—All of
the
morniug papers have liberal comment
on the president's message, the tone of
which is generally favorable for expres­
sions and recommendations contained
therein. The Herald says the message
is a straightforword document which
gives lis a clear photographic v' -w of
the events which have absorbed the
country's attention during the last
twelve months. The prominent topics
discussed are very naturally those sug­
gested by our foreign relations. On the
whole it is a very interesting document
in spite of the fact that we can not al­
ways agree with its conclusions and
might take issue with many of its state­
ments, if wo were so inclined.
The Times says the message is a de­
cidedly more respectable paper than
those that have gone before it. Its tone
is dignified, its arrangement clear and
business like, most of its recommenda­
tions are conservative and sensible, and
some of them are timely and sound.
The Suu says the leading topics of the
message are foreign affairs and the
finances. What it has to say of Chili
is of grave importance. There is no
mistaking the language used, which
throws light on the recent movements
of our warships.
The Recorder says the message is
American throughout. It is the finished
and comprehensive statement of an ex­
ecutive well informed as to the relations
of our country with others, and always
just regarding them, but who considers
every topic, first of all with absoluee de­
votion to the interests of the people of
the United States and particularly of
the great mass of population who are
wage earners.
The Tribune says the one character­
istic of the message which must impress
every candid reader is its absolute fre
dom from partisanship or prejudice.
There is in it no straining for effect. It
is a simple, clear and business-like state­
ment of public affairs, full of practical
suggestions.
The Press says the message is a thor­
oughly American document, in every
line which the spirit of patriotic de­
sire for the public welfare is clearly ex­
pressed.
The World confines its comments on
the .message to that portion of it in
which the president refers to the new sys­
tem in Michigan in choosing presidential
electors, and says he is animated by the
old federal spirit and hungers for federal
control in state affairs. Federal en­
croachment upon local self government,
fThe World adds, has already gone dan­
gerously far, and hostility to its further
advance is the hostility of principle and
prudence, not merely of partisanship.
Chicago Press Comment.
Tribune: The message as a whole is
plain, practical and business like, and
covers the whole field of public interests.
Times: President Harrison pursues
the old form. He commences with the
department of state and the relations of
the republic with the rest of the world,
and having, through the secretary's
spectacles "surveyed mankind from
China to Peru," takes up each depart­
ment in its turn, and consigns to the
congressional dead letter office whole
tons of information and recommenda­
tion.
I News: As a straightforward business
document, couched in dignified and
terse language, President Harrison's
'message is one of the most satisfactory
and comprehensive of recent years.
Globe: The message lacks vigor,
spirit, energy. It is lukewarm, except
advocating aid to a private snap, or in
commending some government official's
work and the McKinley law.
Herald: The.message, unlike the soul
of wit, is long and unlike charity, it
begins abroad, according to immortal
custom. Beginning abroad, it stays
there to the limit of four columns, or
not much less than one-half the entire
length of the document, roaming all the
way from Russia to Hawaii. The por­
tion of the message relating to tariff and
finance is singularly weak.
Inter-Ocean: President Harrison's
annual message conforms admir­
ably to the general purpose of such a
document. It is a resume of the year,
from the standpoint of the United States
government in all departments and lead­
ing bureaus.
From Other Sources.
St. Paul Pioneer Press: The dis­
tinguishing characteristic of the mes­
sage of President Harrison is its intense
practicality. It is a business man's
document such a statement as the head
of an enormous commercial concern
might prepare for its board of directors,
but on a scale commensurate with the
mighty and manifold interests involved.
St. Paul Olobe: The president's mes­
sage is a voluminous and conventional
document without any features of par­
ticular saliency. It is coherent, well
expressed aud gives evidence of that
very respectable degree of intelligence
of which Mr. Harrison, somewhat to
the surprise of the public, has shown
himself possessed.
Minneapolis Tribune: The message
will repay careful perusal, as it is one
of the ablest, clearest and most inter­
esting state papers ever issued from the
White House.
Th
la
from England.
LONDON,Dec. 11.—In commenting on
President Harrison's message The St.
James Gazette says: The most impor­
tant point is that which refers to the
tariff. The arguments presented eom
ptve significantly with British figures,
which show a stationary condition of
trade. It is all well to say that Ameri­
cans will presently discover the mistake
in the fiscal policy, but perhaps they
may not. In the meantime the calcula­
tions of the supporters of che McKinley
bill are working out much better than
any one in England has reason to ex­
pect.
The Daily News says: The president's
message leaves nothing to£be desired
in tone or in temper. Mr. Harrison is
less exasperating than Mr. Blaine, and
consequently more statesmanlike. He
would not speak so tenderly of recipro­
city if his protection policy was a suc­
cess.

Chilian* Find no Comfort In Harrison'*
Meuai*—Preparing for War.
VALPARAISO, Chili, Dec. 11.—The sub­
stance of President Harrison's state­
ment of Chilian affairs has been received
and is a subject of universal comment.
It is regarded by Chilians as- decidedly
menacing a rupture between between
the two countries, as it is not believed
that the Chilian government will con­
sent either to apology or any material
indemnity. The majority in congress is
known to be opposed to any concession,
although poesessed of great influence,
and the Chilian government would
find it difficult to carry the neces­
sary support for humiliating measures.
It is now no secret that the government
is proceeding actively with warlike
preparations and that artillery of the
latest manufacture has been ordered
from Germany in anticipation of hostili­
ties possibly with other powers and
probably with the United States.
More ltritish Storms.
LONDON, Dec. 11.—Another severe
gale has swept over the British isle3
causing an immense amount of damagfe
almost everywhere. Houses were un­
roofed, chimneys blown down and a
number of wrecks are strewn along the
coast. Happily, up to the present there
has been no loss of life reported, but
there is much additional suffering
among those who have already lost by
the half dozen various storms, which
have marked the past year as being an
unprecedented one in the weather his­
tory of this side of the Atlantic. Owing
to the fact that the telegraph wires are
down, in several sections, communica­
tion with those parts is interrupted.
White Caps in Cleveland.
CLEVELAND, Dec. 11. —Even residents

W. H. Burridge's barn at 361 Euclid
avenue, was discovered to be on fire.
Just previous totha discovery of the fire
ti card was found on the door bell of the

services be closed and that he was com­
missioned by Christ to raise this man

BERLIN, Dec. 11.—The German world
of finance has been startled by another
crash among its monied institutions and
by the discovery that another hitherto
highly respected, admired and envied
financier had been embezzling money
for a long time past. In this latest
revelation of fraud Adolph Albeft, a
prominent banker of Mailitz, in Prussian
Silsea, has been declared a bankrupt,
and an examination into his affairs
shows a very poor outlook for his credit­
ors. The banking house ht the head of
which was Herr Adolph Albert was
composed of himself and his brother
Marcus, and from present appearances
Adolph, at least, has been defrauding
his clients for a long time past. He is
said to have embezzled over 2,000.000
marks, including one deposit of 788,000
marks. Albert has left for parts un­
known, but he is believed to be on his
way to the United States. Herr Marcus,
Ado'ph's brother, is believed to be im­
plicated in the embezzlements and has
been placed under arrest.

The number of people disabled is very
great and the disease has attacked

Suicide Rather Than Separation.
CELINA, O., Dec. 11.—Mrs. Went-
worth, of St. Johns, this county, men
tioned Wednesday as having discovered
that her husband was her nephew, com­
mitted suicide at her home during the
afternoon. Her grief at the thought of
legal separation was more than she
could bear, and she resorted to the use
of chloral hydrate. As nearly as can be
ascertained she took about thirty grains.
She was lying in a large arm chair when
found, with the deadly drug in a bottle
by her side. Her husband is wild with
grief. His friends deem it necessary to
watch him closely, lest he may attempt
to follow his wife's footsteps.

A POOR SPECIMEN OF A JUDGE.
He Was Cross Eyed and Red Headed and
the Yankee Was Astonished.
No man in the state had a keener ap­
preciation of humor than the late Judge
T. Lisle Dickie, who served many years
as a circuit judge before being elevated
to the supreme bench of the state. Al­
though he had a rich fund of anecdotal
lore concerning the prominent members
of the Illinois bar, he never related a
good story o' any of his fellow lawyers
with keener relish than the following in­
cident of which he was the hero. It is
necessary to a full appreciation of the
story that the reader should be reminded
that Judge Dickie was cro eyed to a:i
intricate and marvelous degree, and also
gifted with brilliantly red hair.
The story is as follows:
"I had been out shooting prairie chick­
ens down below Ottawa, and was return
ing home on the pnblic road along in
the afternoon. It was hot and I hud
already tramped far enough to get thor­
oughly tired out, and, as it was several
miles to town, I was anxious to catch
ride. The first team that came iilo
was a lightning rod outfit.
'Friend, can you take a passenger:
said 1.
"He looked at me suspiciously. Per­
haps I looked even more cross eyed than
usual without my 'store clothes' on—at
any rate he seemed, at first, of a mi mi
to drive on without me. But he finally
stopped his wagon and condescendingly
remarked:
'Yes you can pile on back there,
top of the rods and ladders.'
"I gratefulily accepted that privilege
and we roue on in silence until we
reached a .vayside watering trough.
The man dismounted, unhooked a pail
from beneath the wagon, and proceeded
to water his horsey. Meantime the pro
prietor of the premises came out to fill
his own pail. He knew me well and
said:
'How d' do, judge. What luck have
yon had shooting?'
"As the word 'judge' fell from his
lips I noticed a look of astonishment on
the face of the Yankee lightning rod
man. The fellow was bolstering up the
pail of water with his knee to a height
from which his horse could drink with
out unchecking, and his astonishment
was so great that he let his knee slip out
from under the pail and splashed the
front of his r'othe.s.
Didn't that feller back there at the
waterin trough call you judge?' inquired
the Yankee, as soon as we had started
on.
Yej,' 1 replied.
'What be you judge of, a hoss race?"
he exclaimed, turning back to take a
second contemptuous inventory of my
personal charms.
'No judge of a court,' I replied.
'What kind of a court?'
'A circuit court,' was my answer.

from, it took a considerable of a feilar
to be circuit judge! How big's your
circuit:'
'It reaches from the Wisconsin line
as far south as Peoria,' I again replied.
"Lifting the hickory stick of his drov­
er's whip he sent its long rawhide lash
twirling in a succession of coils above
his head, which culminated in a crack
like the explosion of a pistol.
'My goodness! I'll settle in this
country myself if they make such a man
as you judge!' cclaimed the disgusted
Yankee. It was his final dictum. He
did not offer to exchange another word
with me. We parted in silence at the
outskirts of the town."—Chicago Mail.
Oh, '«, H.- WiiHii't Afraid.
This particular boy has just come to
Detroit to live, and lie went to the high
6chool for a preliminary examination,
and he went along with just a note of
introduction from his mother. You
know a boy at fourteen is usually all
arms and all legs and self sufficiency,
and this one was no exception to
the
rule. He wasn't troubled with any
doubts about his studies, but his mother
was. She took the role of
the
figurative
hen who flutters on the brink when her
ducklings go in to swim.
Well, when the duckling came home
he swaggered in and told his family in
an offhand manner that it was all right,
you know. Then his mother quizzed
him as to details, and asked him if he
didn't feel badly about going there alone,
and when he said no to that she ex­
pressed her surprise, and then her Solon
ended the discussion.
"I wasn't afraid, mother, because, you
see, I knew that I knew what 1 knew,
and when a feller knows that he knows
what he knows, the whole board of edu­
cation can't bluff him."—Detroit Free

Not So Monotonous.
"Your life must be very monotonous,"
said Gus De Smith, looking in the win­
dow of the Austin postoffice at the clerk
stamping letters.
"What makes yon tmnk so?"
"It would drive me crazy to be ever­
lastingly pounding letters with a liand
etamp. It's the same thing over and
over every day."
"Oh, no. it's not," replied the clerk.
"Yesterday I was stamping 27 on the
letters, today it's 28 and tomorrow I'll
be stamping the 29th of the month, so
you see it's not so monotonous after all."

There was atypical bit. of life shown
in a recent incident in a Brooklyn street
car. Two fashionably dressed women,
strangers to each other, and each with
a child on her lap. found fhemselves
seatmates in a crowded car. The hand­
some blue eyed boy on one knee soon
fell a victim to the coquetries of the
dainty little maiden with golden curis
and soft brown eyes on the other, aL'.'i
to the mutual satisfaction of the parents
a pretty little flirtation went on.
Farther up the car on the other side a
plump, rosy cheeked miss of two years,
a comfortably clad but evidently poor
child, stood against her mother and ad­
miringly watched the pair. At a certain
street the mother of the boy signaled to
stop. "Kiss the baby," she said, as she
stood the little fellow on his feet, mean­
ing of course Miss Golden Hair, and he
turned to obey.
•4t that moment, however, the other
little girl, making her way out with her
mother, was exactly abreast of him, and
Master Blue Eyes, finding this little face
before him, promptly bestowed a soundf
ing, hearty smack upon it. And every­
body smiled, while the prince was led
out, the beggar maid wonderinglv went
her way. and the disappointed princess,
who had leaned forward for the royal
salute, buried her face in her mother's
cloak, learning thus early in life the bit­
ter truth that the kiss is not always for
the. pnawho expects it.
Various L'ses of One Tree.
One of the strangest of trees is the Ita
palm, found abundantly on the banks of
the Amazon aud other South American
rivers. In the swampy regions, which
cover immense areas, the Ita palm fur­
nishes food, drink, clothing and com­
fortable homes for the natives.
The Indians that inhabit these swampy
districts make a tolerable wine from the
sap of the palm, and they distill a strong­
er stimulant by crushing and ferment­
ing the young fruits. The food is de­
rived from the soft inner bark of the
6tems, and is a substance that in taste
and appearance closely resembles sage.
The soft and fibrous bark is used for
garments and for making strings, ropes,
hammocks aud the like.
In times of high water, often lasting
two or three months, the natives make
floorings in the trees with the bark ropes
and live there in comfort and content­
ment.—Philadelphia Times.
