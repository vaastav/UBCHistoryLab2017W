GIVE REASONS FOR
SEGREGATION
SAN FRANCISCO BOARD MAKES
STATEMENT
•chool Authorities Declare They Will
! Keep Japanese Children In Sepa
rate Schools, In Accordanca
with the Treaty
Hy Awsoßlnted Press.
•SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7.— The
board, of education, through City At
torney William 0. . Burke, this after
noon submitted tp United States Dis
trict Attorney Roßert T. Devlin a state
ment 'Of facts bearing on the segrega
tion ;of Japanese children In separate
schools, which It Is planned to make
the 'basis of the legal action that the
federal, government' ls to take to test
the legality of the state statute under
which. the board of education made Its
ruling. The statement of facts pre
sented to Mr. Devlin sets forth all the
facts and circumstances leading up to
the segregation of the Japanese and Is
in the nature of an ultimatum from the
local authorities who declare their In
tention ■< of enforcing It. •■ Mr. Devlin
Stated 'that It would be necessary for
him 'to personally verify the facts as
Bet; forth, and said that on next Mon
day he would be ready to state whether
he ' could accept the statement as a
basis for legal action^
Telegraphed to Washington
The statement was Immediately tele
graphed to Washington, where It Is ex
pected that if? will be considered by
Attorney Oeneral Moody. The Japa
nese government, through its local
consul, has collected a mass of data
In connection with the attendance of
Japanese school children In the schools
6f this ity, some of which is at var
iance with the statistics of the boßrd
of education. To avoid the necessity
of threshing out an enormous mass of
evidence from both sides In the courts,
the government is endeavoring to set
tle and agree with the local authorities
upon certain facts which will be con-
ceded by all parties.
The complainant In the case Is to be
a Japanese pupil of the age of 10 years
who has been barred from the Redding
primary school.
The United States district attorney
Mated his intention to submit the mat
ter to the state supreme court. He
would assign no reason for choosing
this court instead of a federal court
other than an intimation tbat he pre
ferred to have the matter decided by
the Judiciary of the state where It is
in dispute.
Statement of Facts
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7.—Proceed
ings to be begun in the state supreme
court by United States District Attor
ney Devlin, having for their object
the setting aside of the resolutions
of the board of education which pro
vides for the segregation of the Jap-
Snese attending: public schools, will
c based on the following statement
Of fact:
"It Is hereby agreed that the fol
lowing facts are true:
"That the United Stateß entered into
an agreement with the empire of
Japan, which was concluded Novem
ber 22, 1894, the ratification of which
was advised by the senate with
amendments February 5, 1895, and
Ifrhich was ratified by the president
of the Tlnited States February 15, 1895,
that ratifications were exchanged
March 21, 1895. and that the treaty
was proclaimed March 21, 1895, which
treaty is now in full force and effect.
"Section 1662 of the political code of
California provides as follows:
Hower of Trustees I
• "Trustees shall have thp. power to
establish schools for Indian children
j,nd for children of Mongolian and
(phinese descent. When such separate
Schools are established Indian, Chi
nese or Mongolian children must not
be admitted into any other school ex
cept In kindergartens at the age of
four." •
■.■ On October 11, 1906, the board of
education of San Francisco adopted
fhe following resolution:
'.' "Resolved, that in accordance with
article 1, section 1662, of the school
ifiVt of California, principals are here
by directed to send all Chinese, Jap
anese and Korean children to the
Oriental public schools on and after
October 15, 1906."
The document then stages that a
separate school had been established
for orientals which is conducted in all
respects as are other public schools
of the same grade; that trustworthy
and competent teachers are In charge
»nd that the same educational privi
leges, rights and advantages are of
fered the oriental children as are af
forded the children of all other public
schools.
I The statement sets forth that at the
time of the passage of this resolution
there were 93 Japanese children in at
tendance at the several public schools,

JAPANESE CONSUL
APPROVES IDEAS
OF PRESIDENT
By Associated press.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7.— ln nn in
terview published in the Call today
hearing on the reenmmendations made
In his message by President Roosevelt
on Japanese naturalization and on the
segregation of their children In SChOOlli
General K. Ilyeno, the consul for Jap
anese here, says:
"The sentiment In practically univer
sal among the ten thousand Japanese
in San Francisco that the recommenda
tions made by the president constitute
the most rational solution of American-
Japanese problems yet attempted. The
Japanese are not only pleased over the
message, but they regard It ns one of
the most noteworthy documents on in
ternational questions that have been Is
sued from the White House.
"There is no question but that the
bonds between Japan and tho United
States would be considerably strength
ened by conferring the pi vlleges of
ft-anchise on the Japanese In Califor
nia. There are some fifty odd thousand
Japanese in the state, and while I am
not In a position to say how many of
these would take advantage of natural
ization privileges I do think that the
number would be comparatively large.
I think this would be especially so in
the case of the Japanese in San Fran
cisco.
"Many Japanese have family and
property interests hero, and they would
naturally regard San Francisco as
their permanent home once they be
lieved that they had the same priv
ileges as other aliens.
"Concerning the school segregation
Ti lot Is being written and talked about
it that is due to misconception of the
facts in the case. I think that tho
entire matter will be solved satisfac
torily and that there is no occasion for
believing otherwise. The Japanese are
not striving for anything unreasonable
and are quite willing to let the facts
In the dispute guide whatever decision
is to be ultimately rendered."

EXPORTS OF MEAT
INCREASE DESPITE THE
MUCKRAKING EXPOSURE
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.— According
to a statement issued today by the
bureau of statistics of the department
of commerce and labor more than
$250,000,000 worth of meat and dairy
products will have passed out of the
United States Into the markets of
other parts of the world in the year
ending with the present month. This
total Is made up of a little over $200,
00.000 worth of meats, $35,000,000 worth
of cattle and about $10,000,000 worth of
butter, cheese and milk. No feature
of the export in agricultural products
has shown a more steady and rapid
growth than that of meat and dairy
products, where there was an Increase
of about 60 per cent during the past
decade.
LOS ANGELES HERAT,!): SATURDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 8, 1908.
EXHUMED SKULL
AGITATES BESOLD
(nntlnnM from Vnmf Onf )
1 never call a man names when he has
the shackles on.
Admitted Being a Gambler
"We had one more conversation, In
which he told me that he had played
some kind of a gambling game regu
larly on the liners between this coun
try and Europe and had made several
thousand dollars at the game. I In
quired Into the game In case ho might
give me a few pointers, having made a.
pile like that, but he iald it was some
German gam« which, when . ho ex
plained It, I failed to understand."
"You thought it was poker?" sug
gested an attorney.
"Yes," said the sheriff; "that's why I
wanted to get a few pointers."
The attorneys for Resold , then de
manded that his property, Including
two feather boas, be brought Into court,
and Sheriff White was excused from
the stand and with Deputy Gilbert
went to the county Jail to secure the
evidence. . .
Autopsy Surgeon Testifies
puiiiis; hi«i absence thr proaectitlon
cjiiicii i>r. Oeorße Campbell, the autopsy
surgeon. As Dr. Campbell walked t<i
the stand he carried i satchel witii him
which ho placed on a small table to the
right of the witness stum! nnd directly
in front nr the Judge's bench. The
little table was so situated thai any
objert plarM on- It would fnoe directly
m ions thn attorneys' tnblp nnd straight
i' lirsold, who occupied a seat within
blx feet of it.
"November 24 T was called upon to
attend the exhuming of a body ait the
Roselawn potters' field cemetery al
Santa Monica." testified the surgeon.
"At that time a rrnve there whs re
opened nnd the remains of an under
sized human being taken from it. The
body had evidently been exposed a long
time before burial nnd there wns pruc
tii ally no flesh on It. most of what was
there being mummified. At the direc
tion of the officers I took off the head,
or skull, the feot, the right elbow joint
and some of the teeth.
"In the skull I found ft bullet wound
showing that a bullet had entered In
the loft temporal region, making a trim
little hole and had cSWie out on the
rißht, of course making a somewhat
larger hole as the bullet splintered
through the bone."
Besold Becomes Panic. Stricken
Twice during the explanation Dr.
Campbell had made a motion as though
to open his satchel and both times as
he did so Besold watched him closely.
The accused man became nervous and
his gaze wandered about the room any
where but to that small satchel which
remnlned so quietly on the table on a
line with his eyes. At the corner of
his mouth the lines hardened and hi 3
eyes became almost colorless, while the
pupils began to dilate with the look of
a man who la panic stricken and wants
to run.
"Have you that skull with you?"
asked Attorney McComas, and Dr.
Campbell reached over and snapped
back the clasps of the satchel. So still
were the dozen or more spectators In
the room that the snap of the clasps
sounded unnaturally loud In that dingy
little court room. *
As for Besold. he sat as one in a
trance. His eyes were centered on the
satchel as though he would consume
It with a look, yet there was the dull
expression of an Idiot on his face.
Slowly and carefully the surgeon
rummaged his hand in the satchel and
then withdrew it. It held something.
A something that caused a cold chill
of terror to trickle up and down the,
spines of those who saw it. A musky
smell, that horrible smell of an old
grrave permeated the atmosphere, chok
ing and stifling and filling the nostrils
and lungs of the attorneys. It was not
the odor of decomposition; there was
nothing human about that odor. It was
the smell of a mummy, the terrible
smell of a long dead body, preserved
from absolute rot by nature and it
spoke of old vaults and devasted
graveß.
Even Lawyers Are Affected
Even the attorneys shuddered as
they looked at the thing- in the doc
tor's hand. It was a human skull,
small and dull colored. The forehead
was bare, the temples bare of skin and
tho skull bone shone through. To the
left and right of the temples were cav
ities, one small round and neat like an
auger hole, the other big 1 and round,
with ragged edges.
The eyu sockets still retained a thin
gray covering of parchment-like skin,
which broke just .over the deepest and
centermotJt spot of each cavity, show
ing the dark Interior of the skull and
looking for all the world like spectral
eyes.
Where the nose had been there was
a cavity, but from the base of that
cavity extended a Rtrlp of mummified
flesh which fluttered gently In the air
currents -of the room. The back of the
head still boro a thin covering of skin
and two or three lone and solitary
golden hairs protruded from that cov
ering.
Skull Stares Besoid in the Face
With care for details Dr. Campbell
turned the skull first one way then
another and explained the course of tho
bullet. And then he did a strange
thing. Whether from accident or not
he leaned forward and placed that hu
man thing on the little table to his
right. The stump of the neck rested
on the table like a support. The dark
sockets with the gray covering glared
in Steady light across that narrow
table, across the attorneys' table and
straight into v pair of gray eyes on
the Other sldo. But the eyes were no
longer gray then. The gray had faded
from them and they looked white In the
poor light of the room. The man's
hamls seemed to turn pi4k>le, the
knuckles Shone white through the flesh.
Not a muscle of his face moved as lie
stared back ut the sightless .sockets of
tin- (ace he had once loved of the face
of the woman whom he was charged
with having murdered, and like a mes
sage from the grave, grim uml eurning,
vindictive and terrible In its silence,
tha,t skull grinned, the salute of a wife
to lii i huaband. The hideous scrap of
flesh over the lip waved in the air an
though beckoning for a kiss, the jaws
parted ever ao little, seemed pleading
for a spectral caress, while the teeth,
five of them, for the others had been
removed, arranged alternately above
and below like; the Haw teeth of a
pumpkin head, seemed cackling tsume
hellish amusement.
Just once did the accused man look
at the sight and In his eyes was the
look of the maniac. The pupils con
tracted till there was but a pin point
of black, the neck seemed to stiffen
like a wolf at bay and Just over the
cheek bones the flesh turned a purple
hue, but the man never moved a fea
ture. His control was superb.
Sits in Deathly Calm
Not once <iiii he ln"k at the thing
again aa i >r Campbell, like an attend
ant banking flowers about a punch
bowl, i to set off the ukull
»ith iv, ■ mummlfted feet, twisted -nut
horrid, still bearing i stock-
Ings which had been drawn on on that
morning, uml net ofl the whole
by v brukt-u itiiiiiunt of uiui buiio uud
cartilage and a few lonely teeth. One
by one th« pieces of body were Identi
fied, one by one examined, and all be
fore the man sitting there, restless In
action but deadly calm*
Dr. Campbell was requested to re
move the slump* of otocklnga from the
feet, but ho demurred. That perform
ance was too. much even for him and he
told the court that the woman had been
afflicted with tuberculosis and ho
didn't Intend to further endanger him
'-■lf by digging his nails Into the mum
mified flesh.
Woman's Effects Identified
Then a suit cute was produced by
Sheriff White Two WAtcheS, one a
man's, the other a woman's, were Iden
tified as ' Jewelry found on IV>sold at
the time of his arrest. One, the small
er, bore a single name. It was
"Cladle." '
Nine rlngx, for the most part plated
gold with cheap, flnahy settings, were
produced. Many of them were women's
rings which Resold had given his
various iidmlror> only to take away
again. The' suit case was explored
and * white boa of fine ostrich feather
tips and a costly spotted plume ostrich
fenther produced. They were Identified
as gifts formerly belonging to Mrs.
llesold and later given a woman In
Washington. /
AA A great white plume whs next to be
exhibited and It also was filed. Las)
of nil Sheriff White drew n magnificent
lavender boa from the case, It was
seven feet In length with huge tufts
of, lavender ostrich tips at either end.
ltI It nlsn had been a gift to Mrs. Besold,
brought from France. Its soft, feath
ery folds had once encircled that small,
white neck, caressed that soft, white
cheek.
Sheriff Causes Dramatic Scene
■ Sheriff. Whlto is a tall man and he
stood very erect as he held the mass
of feathery stuff aloft to the vision
of "the court. He took a step forward
so that Justice Young might better
Bee it and as he did so one end of
the stuff slipped from his hand and
dropped, dropped like the colls of a
rope, to ii small table below, where it
circled and colled.
The eyes of every man In the court
room rested on the end of the boa In
weird fascination; not the pnd the
sheriff held in his hand, but the fallen
end, for as though to greet a friend
the lavender, feathery stuff again
rested about Mrs. Besold's neck, about
a withered, discolored stump of a
neck. It again caressed those cheeks,
those bony, fleshless cheeks, ajid the
grim sockets and grinning jaws looked
out over a rim of lavender beauty. It
would have beon a good subject for
a moralist, but Los Angeles court
officers are not moralists and the boa
was removed and filed as an exhibit.
At 3 o'clock Besold was held without
bail and went back to his cell.
SAYS HE'LL SUICIDE FOR $50
Writes Doctor and Offers to Sell His
Body to Get Money for a
Friend
Dr. J. W. Trueworthy has received a
letter from a man signing himself "C.
J. C." who makes the grewsome propo
sition to commit suicide and sell the
physician his body for the sum of $50.
The man says his object in so disposing
of his temporal self is to benefit a
friend by giving him the money.
Being doubtful that such extreme un
selfishness exists In a mere mortal, the
physician communicated with Post
master Flint and the police department
regarding the strang epistle. Prior to
this the man had called at the general
delivery window of the postofflce ask
ing for a letter addressed to "C. J. C."
but as letters are often addressed with
initials nothing was thought of the
matter. However, an effort will now
be made to locate the strange author
of the letter to Dr. Trueworthy.^
It Is the opinion of the physician and
of the police that the man made the
offer with the intention of commlting
murder to obtain $50 for the body.

CANNOT BEAR TO BE 'MASHED'
Insane Cook Quits Mine When Threat.
ened with Rocks After He Tries •
to Starve to Death
Special to Tiiu Herald,
SPOKANE, Wash., Dec. 7.— While
hunting and prospecting about the
head of Lake Ohelan George Franels
and Henry Desmond, two Chicago
men, had a remarkable experience with
their cook, an Irishman named Burns,
who became Buddonly insane and dis
appeared from camp. He was not
found for threo days and the party
were about to abandon the search on
the supposition that he had deserted
them when he was discovered by a
dog belonging to the party.
Burns wus at the bottom of an
abandoned mine shaft, four miles west
Of the camp, ami was making an
earnest endeavor to starve himself to
death. When found Burns refused all
assistance. One of the men lowered
a flask of liquor and some food to the
man b] i rope, lie refused
to touoh them, telling the men to go
away and leave him there, as he
sever wanted to see daylight again,
iu refused to explain how he got to
the bottom or the Shaft, which was
forty feel deep ami only asked to bo
left alone.
A messenger who was sent back to
the caiuji returned with v rope and
this was lowered to Burns and ho was
told to fasten It about hit) body, but
Instead of doing bo he attempted to
pull the rope out of the hundu of his
would he resouers.
Is then volunteered to allow
hlmwelf to be lowered into the pit, but
no wooner had he swung over ltn mouth
iiiin Burns began i<> r»ve and curse
ami threaten wtiii deaifl any one who
attempted to descend Into the shaft,
causing FranelH to beat a husty re
treat.
AA A council of war was held and It was
decided to attempt!' to divert the man's
mmdm mind from his intention of Starving
to death. He was asked it he would
not prefer to kill himself by shooting
and an offer was made to lower him
a gun. but Burns refused the proffer,
declaring that lie had a gun but' that
he had a good opportunity to 'Starve
himself to death, .mil this he intend
ed /to do. They then began abusing
him, hoping to' get' him so mad -that
in- ■■ would want' to clamber out of the
pit in order to fight, but again they
were unsuccessful.
Finally an Indian guide known as
"Jim" told tho Irishman that the oth
er men were going away and that they
had instructed him to throw stones
Into the pit until Burns was smashed
an flat as a flapjack, as they could not
bear to hnve a man deliberately starve
himself to death.
"Jim" thon began throwing small
stones down the shaft, some of them
hitting JiuriiH. This was too much for
the cook. "While he wan resigned to
the Idea of starving himself to death
he declined to be mashed to a pulp,
nd yelling to fhe Indian to stop
throwing stones he signified a willing
ness to come up. He was first made
to attach his gun to the rope, and this
being hauled up the cord again was
lowered and Burns came to the sur
face. He was quite weak from tho
lack of nourishment, but still refused
to eat. He was put to bed and the
Indian placed over him as a guard, a
pile of stones by his side. When he
awoke food again was offered him, and
upon hlu again refusing to eat the In
dian went to the rock pile and picking
up a handful of dornicks threatened to
stone the man. This had the desired
effect, and Burns ate heartily, in a
couple of days he had sufficiently re
covered to leave the camp, the Indian
i long as a guard, his pocket j
tilled with rocks.
