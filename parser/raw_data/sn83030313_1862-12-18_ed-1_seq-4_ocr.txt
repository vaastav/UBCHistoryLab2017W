The Country in Danger?What the Pre
sident la Called I'pon to Do.
The country is in danger. With the most
powerful army afoot which any nation on the
face of the globe has ever brought into the
field, and with a nary afloat which is compe
tent to gr ippfe with the thousand war 3hips of
England, the country is still in danger. It is
not the peril of another advance of the ragged
rebel armies of Jeff. Davis upon Washington,
nor the danger of foreign intervention, but it
is tho greater danger of the total loss of fhe
confidence of our loyal people in the success of
this war under President Lincoln's adminis
tration.
The public mind?with the full comprehen
sion of the terrible battle of Saturday last, and
the unavailing sacrifice therein of over ten
thousand killed and wounded soldiers?has
been excited to a degree of despondency and
indignation which is truly appalling. The de
pressing sensation produced by the seven davs
?
battles in front of Richmond, and thai resulting
from Lee's subsequent pursuit of another
branch of our army to the very gate" of the na
tional capital. were comparatively light and
evanescent. This fearful and useless slaughter
of our brave ?oung Union soldiers at Frede
ricksburg has kindled the new element of wrath
in the seething currents of public opinion which
President Lincoln cannot safely disregard. No
man do .lits his patriotism?all men admit his
amiable and generons nature; but the country
now demands of him that amiability shall give
way fo resolution, and that the malign influ
ences around him, which have brought upon the
national cause all it# disasters and di appoint
ments. shall be discarded and tuned adrift.
i Nor will this suffice to restore the public
confidence in the administration. Something
more is demanded. Able men, commanding
the confidence of the country, must take the
places of the blundering fanatics and sc heming
politicians who distract the counsels of the
Cabinet, and the places, too. of tlfr incompetent
martinets of the War Office; and there
must be no fuither dictation to the Exe
cutive by the abolition Marplots of the legis
lative branch of the government. In a word,
the President is called upon to reconstruct the
working elements of his administration upon
the basis of an intelligent, consistent and prac
tical prosecution of the war; and in doing this
he will regain the esteem and cheerful support
of the people. As he stands this day, we earn
estly admynish him that, from his loss of this
public confidence, his administration and the
country are in danger.
Only look ut our present situation. With a
lavish rretierosity and enthusiasm never before
exhibited by any people under the sun, the
loyul people of the powerful North have mot
every requisition of their President in behalf of
the grejif, work of suppressing this Southern re
bellion They have poured out their
treasures and their blood like water*
until the record will show a sacrifice
of two hundred thousand of their gallant Union
volunteer* ,uid twelve hundred millions of
?floncy for U" ir sacred cause. This devoted
people too. hav* cheei fully submitted to war
ts N-e- wur prices, derangements of business, and
nil the fln?u>'i.il disorders of an exclusive paper
currency, and for nil these sacrifice* of eighteen
months of this riKUt, dreadful war, what have we
gained? We have gained much, and yet we
bavi gained nothing while a victorious rebel
arm/ holds its ground within sixty raile.n of
Washington.
This is the public judgment, and the over
ruling popular idea in the loyal North is the
necessity for a new departure on the part of j
I resident Lincoln, beginning with the unsound
timbers of his Cabinet. Time is preoious
The drain upon the couutry of nearly
three millions of dollars a day admits of no
further trifling. With the land and naval forccs
which he now commands, President Lincoln may
put down this rebellion within three months.
Old Hickory, in his place, would have done it
in sixty dayB. Let Mr. Lincoln put on the
mantle of Old Hickory, " assume the rosponsi
bility,' strike out boldly for the confidence of
the people, and all will soon be right and
bright again. Otherwise the country will become
more and more involved in danger, until the
great cause of the Union and of popular rights
and free institutions may be lost in endless
divisions and universal anarchy. The loyal
States have given him the means, and they look
to President Lincoln to save the life of the
nation.
The Bloodthirsty Atrocity of tltr Radi
cals.
That infamous radical organ, the New York
Tribune, says that ''We have by telegraph the
gratifying announcement that General Burn
side has regained his old position on this
side of the Rappahannock," and adds that
'?in this last movement against the rebels
we see mueh cause lor public satisfaction."
Is it of a great victory, gloriously won
the national arms, that the radical editor of
the Tribune writes? Is it over a triumph of the
Union forces, which has made rebellion stagger
to its death, that the radical organ rejoices?
For the credit of human nature one would fain
bolieve so. But, alas! no self-deception could
conceal the truth. The "gratifying announce
ment' which the Tribune had to make yester
day morning was the announcement of the most
overwhelming Union defeat of the war. The
"movement against the rebels," over which the
radicals tauntingly exult, was the retreat of our
army across the Rappahannock. The news in
which the abolitionists "see much cause for
public satisfaction" is the slaughter of ten or
twelve thousand Union soldiers by the insane
command of the radicals of the War Depart
ment. ,
We hold the Triburu editor and hit follow*
conspirators among the radicals responsible be
fore God and the country for the disastrous
issue of the Fredericksburg battles. They and
their instruments in the War Department led
our gallant army into the trap which the rebels
had set for it, and caused the wanton and de
liberate butchery of our brave soldiers. The
radicals of the War Department practically
superseded General Burnside, as thoy had effec
tually superseded General McClellan, in the
command of the Amy of the Potomac. All
that Burnside could do was to remain with the
army and try to save it from utter annihilation.
This he has fortunately accomplished, and for
this he deserves the credit. Upon the radicals
of the War Department and their colleagues
falls the whole crushing weight or the failure.
If the army was delayed before Fredericksburg,
cither by the want of supplies or the non
j arrival of the pontoon trains, the radicals are
responsible; for it wag the duty of the War De
partment to hare the supplies ready and the
pontoon trains on the bank of the river, ao that
the army might immediately cross. When
several weeks had passed, and the rebels had
made a Gibraltar of the low bills back
of Fredericksburg, then came the impera
tive command from the radicals of the
War Department to General Burnside to
cross the river and begin the battle. In vain
did all BMrnside's officers disapprove the move
ment. In vain did soldiers and civilians alike
agree that to drive out the rebels by assault
was an impossibility. The War Department
overruled all objections, and ordered this im
possibility to be attempted. The result was
j the slaughter of thousands of our bravest sol.
: diers; and of this outrageous massacre we pro
| nounce the radicals guilty.
I The people will remember the excitement
which followed the rout at Manassas ; but Ma.
nas.sus was innocent and bloodless compared to
the magnitude and the cool atrocity of this
slaughter at Fredericksburg. The gory ghosts
i which rose from the plains of Manassas to appall
I the Tribune editor into a brain fever, and wring
j from his quivering lip* a trembling confession
; of bis criminality, were meek and placable in
I comparison with the terrible, maimed and
I 1 deeding phantoms which must now surround
| these radical wretches, who exult like ghouls
I over the mangled corpses of the fallen. The
idea of representing the disaster at Fredericks
burg as " a cause for public satisfaction'' is
| worthy of a fiend. To the radicals, however,
| we have no doubt that the news of our ropulse
was "a gratifying announcement." To them
the battle was but the destruction of a few
thousand conservatives, or a new sacrifice to
the manes of John Brown, their martyred
representative. It is the policy of
the radical! to rejoice over national
misfortunes. Their victories are the defeats of
the nation. Their life is the death of the coun
try. From the very beginning of this war,
which was caused by their agitations and de
veloped by their Intrigues, the radicals have, in
every possible way, aided the rebellion. Their
object and that of the rebels is identical.
The dissolution of the Union and the establish
i ment of an abolitionized Northern republic are
I aa much the end of the radicals' ambition as is
the establishment of a Southern confederacy
the dream of the foul traitors who support
Jeff. Davis. The rebels aim their cannon at
our people, and the radicals march loyal men in
front of those cannon and hold them there to
receive the fatal discharge. The waste of lojal
life and blood and treasure through radical
means since this war begun is sickening to re
member. If there be a just God. this culmi
nating.crime at Fredericksburg cannot long re
main unavenged. Never before were the Ameri- !
can people so thoroughly roused and intensely
moved. Never did the very name of a radical
so stink in the nostrils of the nation/ The soil
of this country, which tl?'y have too long pol
luted,ought to scorch the feet of t hese miscreants
as they wulk. The pious execrations of the
countrymen^f our murdered soldiers should
follow thes<* radical butchers and hiss them out
ol the land. Unworthy of the name of Americans
or of men, these bloodthirsty and ferocious abo
litionists should be branded with imperishable
infamy, expelled from all eivilizcd communities
in this world, and assigned to the company of
Judas Iscariot aud Benedict Arnold in the next, j
OfMUjr as m Political Cheat and a Hy
PmHM.
That insane dewire for notoriety which has
afflicted poor Greeley all his life has again
brought him into a content with that veteran
political pugilist, Thurlow Weed. The very
natural consequence is that poor Greeley. who
has neither pluck nor science, is beinp polished
off in a mann er most edifyjng to all beholders
A. Oakey Hall, our shrewd District Attorney,
takes a hand in at the melee, as is his duty; for
poor Gneeley is a wretched old criminal, and
every district attorney and good e'tizen is
bound to do bis utmost to drag the Tribune
drab to justice. Between the<e two a lversu
r'es this remarkable philosopher?who attauks
jobbery in his paper and practises it in persia,
and who eats no meat at diuner, but sups his
full of bloody horrors whenever he can inveigle
our troops into a rebel trap?is getting the
worst of it severely. Stripping the lion s skin
off of the ass is nothing to the cruel operation
whioh Messrs. Weed and llall are now perform
ing. They are delicately flaying poor Greeley
alive, and then politely whipping him before
the world with the stinging nettles of his own
coarse words.
Messrs. Weed and Hall know poor Greeley
better than any other two men on earth. Thur
low Weed took Greeley when the rascal had
not two pair of breeches to his legs, and gave
him a clean shirt, a good dinner and a new pair
of boots. At that time Greeley did seem to
have some gratitude; for he remained with
Weed aud worked for him pretty steadily,
though not to any purpose. At length, how
ever, ambition got the uj>per hand of prudence
and choked gratitude ; and so Greeley wrote
Weed and Seward a snivelling letter, complain"
ing that he couldn't lmve all the offices he
wanted, and then started out into the wond to
abuse his beneiactor and seek his fortune. A
nice mess he has made of it altogether, i'oor
Greeley has descended from sta.jjo to stago of
vice and degradation. All sorts of gift enter
prises and lotteries, and such works of wicked
ness, arc as tamiliar to Greeley as the nose on
his face. The corruptions of lobbying are his
chosen element, and he wallows in it like
a pig in the mire. During some of
these nefarious transactions, over which we
kindly throw the veil of generalities, Greeley
begged A. Oakey Hall to become his counsel.
Aa a lawyer la obliged to accept even the most
contaminated clients, Mr. Hall consented.
Where Thurlow Weed's knowledge of Greeley
leaves off, therefore, Mr, Hall's knowledgeJ>e,
gins. Between them they are able to give
us a very full and impartial estimate of the
Tribune philosopher's character.
Mr. Weed says that "the Tribune lias been
represented in the lobby at Albany for many
years by an assistant editor, who is a brother
in-law of Mr. Greeley," and who "is understood
to have a finger in all the pies baked in the Al
bany lobby." Greeley, conscience striekeu,
straightway confesses that Mr. John F. Cleave*
land is the man. "One or more assistant edi
tors," continues Mr. Weed, "are understood to
be equally diligent and successful in 'gun con
tracts' and other jobs in- Washington, while
half a dozen other assistant editors of the Tri
bune rejoice in foreign appointments.'-' To this
charge poor Greeley says that he "cannot make
room for a special reply." We should think
not. A list of those Tribune editors who have
contracts and government jobs, aud who now re
joice in foreign appointments, would be almost
aa long as the list of the killed and wounded
soldiers sacrificed at Fredericksbt^g by the
Tribune's intrigues. Mr. A. Oakey Hall, how
ever, steps briskly forward with his evidence
upon this point. "I may state." nays Mr. Hall,
"that, having been during several years coun.
sel for varions persons desiring to advance or
oppose legislative or contract interests, I found
in every matter the direct inlhience of Mr
Greeley." Heartbroken at this rev elation, and
too much overcome with grief to be particular
about his language, Greeley exelnirus:?"True
for you, Oakey." For the purposes of exert
ing confessions, Mr. Hall's style seems equal to
the rack. But Mr. Weed puts in the finishing
stroke. He saya: ?

saw and read his letter
This acts upon Greeley like a dose of arsenic
He writhes and squirms and foams at the mouth
with rage and lury. At first he madly de
nounces the story as "a vilhinous fals"hood."
Then, recollecting that Weed hold him like a
fly pinned to the wall, and may possibly pro
duce the letter. Greeley sobbingly adds:?"We
may have been induced to write that if Bennett
could not have the office, or if his appointment
was out of the question, we should be satis
fied with the appointment of another valued
friend." If?if?if! Poor Greeley. He con

A Blow at tiik Bastiijcs.?The Grand Jury

of New York in the arbitrary and illegal arrest,
and imprisonment of citizens ?f thi* .State, a.ol
from all that we can learn it is highly probable
indictments will be found against him. The

who expouuded the law by showing lliat. the
removal of any person from this State into any
other State or Territory to answer to any charge
of having committed an offence t^ainst the

in violation ol the statute, and o<|tinllv to vit,
late it is an arrest with u view to secret con
linement in this State; nor will it constitute any
legul defence to plead upon trial th 't the ar.

T"
Govemor Seymour, after hi# inauguration on
the 1st of the enduing month, will issue a requi
sition demanding the surrender of Mr. Stun ton
to answer the charges against him. As the
President has bworn to obey the constitution'
which requires the surrender of alleged crii.ii
nals, and a* Mr. Lincoln Is Governor of the Dis
trict of Coluirbia, he will, of course, feel bound
by his oath to deliver up Mr. Stanton to th?
officers of jwtice. to be decH with according to
law. There is a good time coming. If there ia
no otlser way of getting rid of so incompetent a
Secretary of War this would be an excellent
opportunity for the President; but we hope
he will not wait so long.
The Papbhmakers' TnoiuMW.?We publish
in another column a very curious sort of a letter
from Mr. II. V. Butler, the President of the
1'sipermaker.v Association of this city. We give
the epistle ju*t as we received it, and have to
add only a word or two of commentary.
Mr. Butler's remark! are divided under tw*
beads: first, the correspondence in the case of
ik". M. L. Seymour; and, second, a philiplc
agaiust the press. In regard to the first point*
it appears that Mr. Seymour declined to become
an offic er of the association long before he ad
dressed us a note upon the subject. This show*
that. Mr. Seymour is a Tory sensible man, but
does uot explaiu why Mr. Seymour's name was
printed among the vice presidents in the pub
lished copies of the constitution of the associa
tion.
In regard to the press, Mr. Butler says that
our "accusations" were "unjust and false,"
and that " however you may writhe tmder" the
extravagant price of paper " you must pay it."
Well, necessity knows no law, and perhaps we
?? must pay" anything the Papermakers'Associ
ation choose to demand; but that does not at all
alter the right and wrong of the matter. From
the recent rise in paper?far in advance of the
i rife in the materials of which paper Is made
it is evident that the association is a monopoly,
and the tone of Mr. Butler's note tells the rest
u. the story. As to the association's continuing
to exist and to perform " the duties for which
it was instituted"?that is. keeping up the price
of paper?this all depends upon circumstances.
The Hon. Mr. Collar, has already introduced s
bill into Congress reducing the duty on foreign
i paper to the same percentage as tho tax upo*
j domestic paper; and, if this bill t-hall be passed,
; the price of paper may perhaps be kept up by
| the association " in spite of the press," but it
i will bp done without ibejpatrouage of the press.
1 And so we politely dismiss Mr. Cutler and hia
i letter.
Tiik He i uht of I MrwjnNCK.?One of the coolest
I pieces of impudence we have ever witnessed is
the proposition of Alderman Boole to remove
the Commissioners of the Central Park?who
have made the place what it is?and to put it
under the dominion of Boole A Co? The only
streets which are at all passable ?just now ar?
those which run through the Central Park. If
tho Central Park were turned over to the Com
mon Council it would become the theatre of the
rowdies every Sunday, and a sort of pandemo
nium. It is now prohibited to the fast trotting
horses. Let Boole & Co. get hold of it, and no
private carriage would be any longer safe. It
would become a scone of filth and violence,
and what is now an ornament and a blessing
to the city would become a disgrace and a
curse.
