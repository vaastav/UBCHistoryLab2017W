MESSAGE"
OP THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
"So the two Honsas of Congress* at the Com?
mencement of tho Second Session.
Fcllow-Citecns of the Senate and Hottse of Sepresenta
Aftar a brief interval the Congress of the United States
resumes its annual legislative labors. An all-wise and
merciful Providence has abated the pestilence which
visited our shores, leaving its calamitous traces upon
some portions of our country. Peace, order, tranquillity,
and cirtl authority, have been formally declared to exist
throughout tho whole of the United Statos. In all of the
States civil authority has superceded the coercion of
arms, and the people, by their voluntary action, are \
matoteiplng their governments in full activity and com?
pl?t? op?ration. The' enforcement of the laws is no long?
er "obstructed in any State by combinations too powerful
to be suppressed bj the ordinary courseof. judicial pro?
ceedings;" and the animosities engendered by tho war
are rapidly yielding to tho beneficent Influences of our
free institutions, and'to.the kindly-effeots of unrestricted
social and comm-'rcial intercourse. An entire restoration
of fraternal feeling must bo tho earnest wish., of. every
patriotic heart; and we wilThave accomplished Our
grande-1 national achievement' when, forgetting the :sad
events of thc past, and remembering only their instruc- .
tive lessons,. we resume our onward career as a free,
prosperous and united people.
In my message of the 4th af December, 1865, Congress
was informed of the measures which had been instituted
by the Executive with a view to the gradual-restoration
of the States in which- the insurrection occurred to their
relations with the 'General. Government. .Provisional
Governors had bean appointed, Convention's 'called, Gov?
ernors elected, Legislatures assembled, and Senators and
Representatives chosen to the Congress of. the United
States. Courts had been opened for the enforcement of
laws long in abeyance. The blockade- had been removed,
custom-houses re-established, arid the internal revenue
laws put in force in order that the people might eontrib- ?
nte to the national income. . Postal, operations had been
renewed* and efforts were being made to restore them to
their former condition of efficiency. The States'them?
selves had been asked to take part in the high functions
of amending the Constitution, and of thus sanctioning
the extinction of African slavery as ;cne of the legitimate
results bf our internecine struggle; > .'
Having progressed thus far, the Executive Department
found that it had accomplished nearly all that waa with?
in the scope of its constitutional authority. One thing,
however, yet remained to be done before the work of
restoration could: be completed, end that was the admis?
sion to Congress of loyal Senators and Representatives
from'the States whose people1 had- rebelled against the
lawful authority of the General Government. This ques?
tion devolved upon the respective Houses, which, by the
Constitdtion, are made the judges of the elections, re?
turns, and qualifications of their own- members;' and its
consid?ration atone? engaged the-attention of Congress.
In th? meantime, the Executive Department-no other
plan having been proposed by Congress--continued its
efforts to perfect, as far os was practicable, the restora?
tion of the proper relations between the- citizens of the
respective States, the States, and the Federal Govern?
ment, extending, from time to time, as the public inter?
ests seem to require, the judicial, revenue, and postal
systems of the country. With the advice and consent of
the Senate, tho necessary officers were appointed, and
appropriations made by Congress for tho payment of
their'salaries, The proposition to amend the Federal
Constitution, so as to prevent tho existence of slavery
within the United States or any place subject to. their
jurisdiction, was ratified by the requisite number of
States; and on the 18th day of December, 1865, it was
officially declared to have become valid as a part of the
United States. All of the States in which the rebellion
had existed promptly amended their Constitutions, BO as
to make them eonform to the great change thus .effected',
in the organic law of thaland; declared null and void all
ordinances and laws of secession; repudiated all pre?
tended debts and obligations created for the revolution?
ary purposes of the insurrection; and proceeded, in good
.faith, to?the enactment of measures for the protection
and amelioration of the condition of the colored race.
Congress, however, yet hesitated to admit any of these
States to representation; and it was not until towards the
close of the eighth month of the session that, an exception
was made in favor of Tennessee, by thu admission of her
Senators and Representatives.
I deem it a subject of profound regret that Congress
has thus far failed to admit to seats loyal Senators and
Representatives from the other S tates,V who se inhabit?
ants, with those of Tennessee had engaged in tho rebel
Bon. Teri States-more than one-fourth of the .whole,
number-remain without r<^resontetikm ; ihs seats jjf.fif^,
?jfcjc^BlitoTjer?^^ ^
tweniy-members iii the Senate are yet vacant-not by.
their own consent, not by a failure of election, but by the
refusal "of Congress to accept their credentials. Their
admission, it is believed, would have accomplished much
toward the renewal and strengthening of our relations aa
one people, and removed serious causa far discontent on
the part of the inhabitants of those States. It would
have accorded with the great principle enunciated in the
Declaration of American Independence, that no people
ought to bear the burden of taxation, and yet be denied
the right of represen a?oe. It would have been in con?
sonance with the express provisions of the Constitution,
that "each State shall have at least one Representative,"
and "that no State, without its consent, shall be deprived
of its equal suffrage in the Senate." These provisions
were intended to secure to every State, and to the people
of every State,' the right of representation in each House
of Congress; and so important was it deemed by the
framers -of the Constitution that the equality of the
States in the Senate should be preserved, that not even
by an amendment of the Constitution can any State,
without its consent, be denied a voice in that branch of
the National Legislature.
It is true, it has been assumed that the existence of the
States was terminated by the rebellious acts of their in?
habitants, and that the insurrection having been sup?
pressed, they were thenceforward to be considered mere?
ly as conquered territories. The Legislative, Executive
and Judicial Departments of the Government have, how?
ever, with great distinctness and uniform consistency,
refused to sanction an assumption so incompatible with
the nature of oar republican system, and with the pro?
fessed objects of the war. Throughout the recent legis?
lation of Congress, the undeniable fact makes itself appa?
rent that these ten political communities are nothing less
than States of this Union. At tile very commencement
'of the rebellion eaoh House declared, with a unanimity
as remarkable as it was significant, that the was not
"waged upon oar part in any . spirit of oppression, nor
for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor pur?
pose of overthrowing or' interfering with the rights
or established institutions of those States, but to de?
fend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution
and all laws made in pursuance thereof, and to pre?
serve the Union with all the dignity, equality and rights
of the several States unimpaired; and that as soon as
. .these objects were accomplished the war ought to cease."
m some instances. Senators were permitted to continue
their legislativo functions, while in other instances Re?
presentatives were elected and admitted to seats after
their States had formally declared their right to with?
draw from the Union, and were endeavoring to mn.inty.1n
that right by force of arms. AU bf the States whose peo?
ple ware in tosurrection, as States, were included in the
apportionment of the direct tax of twenty millions of dol?
lars annually laid upon the United States by the act ap?
proved 5th August, 1861. Congress, by the act of March
4,1863, and by the apportionment of representation there?
under, also recognized their presence aa States in .the
Union; and they have, for judicial purposes, been divid?
ed into districts, as States alone-can be divided.. The
same recognition appears in the recent legislation in re?
ference to Tennessee, which evidently reste upon the fact
that the functions of the State wera not destroyed by the
rebellion, but merely suspended ; - and that principle is of
course applicable to those States. which, like Tennessee,
attempted to renounce their places in the Union".
The action of the Executive Department or the Govern?
ment upon thitf subject has been equally definite and
uniform, and tho purpose of the war was specially stated
in the Proclamation issued by my predecessor on the
22d day of September, 1862. It was then solemnly pro?
claimerand declared that "hereafter, as heretofore, the'
war will be prosecuted for the object of practically, re?
storing the constitutional relation between the United
States and each of the States and the people thereof, in
which States that relation is or may be suspended or dis?
turbed." r.
The recognition of the States by the Judicial Depart?
ment of the Government has also been clear and conclus?
ive in all procea lings affecting them as States, had in the
Supreme, Circuit, and Distill Courts.
In the admission of Senators and Representatives from
any and all of the States, there can be no just ground of
apprehension that persons who are disloyal will be
clothed, with the powers of l?gislation; for Uris could
not happen when the Constitution and the laws are en?
forced - by a vigilant and faithful Congress. Each House
is made the "judge of the elections, returns, and qualifi?
cations of its own members," and may, "with the con?
currence'of two-thirds, expel a member." "When a Sena?
tor or Representative presents bis certificate of election,
he may at once bo admitted or rejected; or, should there
he any question as to bis eligibility, his. credentials may
ba referred' for investigation to the appropriate commit?
tee. If admitted to a seat, it must he upon evidence sat?
isfactory to the House of which he thus becomes a mem?
ber, that he possesses the requisite constitutional and
Wal qualifications.
? refused admission as a member for want of due Aile,
giancf- io the Government, and returned to his con?
stituents, they are admonished that none but per. ons
loybl to the United States will be allowed a voice in the
Legislative Council-? of the Nation, and the polltio.il
power and moral influence of Congress are thoa effect?
ively exerted is the interests of loyalty to the Govern
ment and fl'silty to the Union. Upon this question,
so virally affecting the restoration of the Union and the
permanency of our present form of government, my
convictions, heretofore expressed, have undergone no
change; but, OB the contrary, their correctness has
bean confirmed by reflection and time. If the admis?
sion of loyal members to seats 1 the respective Bouses
of Congress was wise and expedient a year ago, lt ls no
less wise and expedient now.- If this anomalous condi?
tion lsxight BOTT-if, in the exa-t condition of these
States at the present time, it is lawful to exclude them
from repreeeatation, I t?o not see that the question will
be chanced by th? efflux of time. Ten years he^ce, if
these Stetes remain as they are, the right of representa?
tion will bs rio stronger-the right of exclusion will be
BO weaker.
The Constitution o? the United State i inakesitths
duty ol the Prepident to recommend to the considera
jtion of Congress "such measures as he shall
udge necessary or expedient." I know of no
measure more imperatively demanded by every consid?
eration of national interest, sound policy, ?ind 6qual
justice, than the admission of loyal mombers from tho
now unrepresented States. This would consummate
the work of restoration, and exert a most salutary in flu
ence in the re-establishment of peace, hatmony,and
fraternal feeliDg. lt would tend Rreatly to renew the
confidence of the American people in the vigor and sta?
bility of their institutions. It would bind us more
closely together as a nation, and enable us to show to
the world the inherent and recuperative power of a
Government founded upon the will of the peo?
ple, and established upon the principles cf
liberty, justice, and intelligence. Our in?
creased strength and enhanced prosperity would
irrefragably demonstrate the fallacy cf the argu?
ments against free institutions drawn from our recent
national di orders by the enemies of republican gov?
ernment. The admission of loyal members from the
States now.excluded from Congress, by allaying doubt
and apprehension, would turn capital, now awaiting an
opportunity for investment, into the channels of trade
and industry. It would alleviate the present troubled
condition of those states, and, by inducing emigration
aid in the settlement of fertile regions now uncultivat?
ed, and lead to an increased production of those staples
winch have added so greatly to the wealth of the nation
and the commerce of the world. Kew fields of enter?
prise would oe opened to our progressive people, and
soon thedevastations.of war would be repaired, and all
traces of our domestic differences effaced from the
minds of our countrymen.
In our efforts to preserve, ?-the unity of Government
which constitutes us one people," by restoring the
States to the condition which they held prior to tte i e
beiiion, wp thould be cautious, lest, having rescued our
nation from perils of threatened disintegration, we re?
sort to.consohdation, and in the end absolute despotism
as a remedy for the recurr?nce of similar troubles. The
war having terminated, and with it all occasion for the
exercise of powers of ?oubtful congtitutionality, we
should ha?ten to briDg legislation witbiu the boundaries
? prescribed by the Constitution, and to retain to thc
ancient landmarks established, by our fathers for ihe
gnida-Bce of succeeding generations. "Tho Constitution
which at any time exists, until changed by an explicit
and authentic act of the whola people, is sacredly obli
gatvry upon alL " "If, in the opinion of the people, the
distribution or modification of the constitutional pow?
ers be, in any particular, wrong, let it be corrected by
an amendment in the way in which the Constitution de?
signates. But let there be no change by usurpation
for "reis the customary weapon by which free Govern?
ments are destroyed.*' .Washington spoke thees words
to hiscpuntrymea ."when , followed by their love and grati?
tude, be voluntarily retiraeKrom the caree of pnblic life"
'To fceep In all things within the pale of our constitu?
-?onal powers, and cherish the Federal Union as the only
rock of safety," were prescribed by Jefferson as rulesof
ac?on to endear to bia "countrymen the true principles
of then* Constitution, and promote a union of sentiment
.J^r10? e?J"dly auspicious to their happiness and
safety." Jackson held that the action of the General
.Government should , always be strictly confined to the
sphere of. its appropriate duties, andjus?y and forcibly
urged that our Government is not to be maintained nor
pur Union preserved "by invasions of the rights and
powers of the several States. ' In thus attempting to make

the teachings of men whose deeds and services have made
them Illustrious, and who, long since withdrawn from the
scenes of hie, have left to their , country the rich legacy of
tiieir example, their wisdom, and their patrtotiim.
.urawing fresh inspiration, from their. lessons, let us
emulate them in love of country and respect for the Con?
stitution and laws.
The report of the ' Sr-etary of the Treasury affords
much information reepr.-'- ag the revenue and.commerce
ot the country. His views upon the currency, and with
reference to a proper adjustment of our revenue system,
internal as well as impost, are commended to the careful
consideration of Congress. Tn my last annual message I
expressed my general views upon these subjects/ I need
now only call attention to the necessity of carrying into
every department bf the Government a system of rhrid
accountability, throngh. retrenohment, and wise econo?
my, with no exceptional ncr unusual expenditures, the
oppressive^burdens of taxation can be lessened bysnch

indicate than these statements the extent and availabil?
ity of the national resources, and the rapidity and safety
wi'h which, under our form of government, great mili?
tary and naval establishments can be disbanded, and
expenses re?uced from a war toa peace footing.
During the fiscal year ending the 30th of Juno, 1866.

$520,750,940, leaving an available surplus of $37,281,680
It is estimated that the receipts for the fiscal year ending
the i 0th June, 1867, will be $475,061,386, and that theex
penditures will reach the sum of $316,428,078, leaving in
the Treasury a surplus of $158,633,308. For theflscal
year ending June 30, 1868, it is estimated that the re?
ceipts will amount to $4S6.0?H>,000, and that the expendi?
tures will be S350,247,64i-showing an exc?s of $86,762,

ceipts may be diminiahed by a reduction cf excise and
import duties; but after all necessary reductions shall
have been made, the revenue of the present and of fol?
lowing years w?Tdoubtlees be sufficient to cover an le?
gitimate charges upon the Treasury, and leave a large
annual surplus to be applied to the payment of the prin?
cipal of the debt There seems now to be no good rea?
son why taxes may not be reduced as the country ad?
vances in population and wealth, and yet the debt be ex
? anguished within the next quarter of a century.
\ The report of the Secretary of JWar furnishes valuable
and important infoimationrln reference to the operations
; of hie Department during the past year. Few volunteers
now remain in the service, and they are being discharged
as rapidly as they can be replaced by regular troops. The
army has been , promptly paid, carefully provided with
medical treatment, well sheltered and subsisted, and is
tobe furnished with breech-loading small arms. The
military strength of the nation has been unimpaired by
the discharge of volunteers, the disposition o? unservice?
able or perishable stores, and the retrenchment of ex?
penditure. Sufficient war material to meet any emergen?
cy has been retained, and, from the disbanded volunteers
standing ready to respond to the national call. large ar?
mies can be rapidly organized, equiDoed, and concentra?
ted. Fortifications on the coast and frontier have re?
ceived, or are being prepared for more powerful arma?
ments; lake surveys and harbor and river improvements
are m course of energetic prosecution. Preparations
have been made for the payment of the additional boun?
ties authorized during the recent session of Congress,
undersuch regulations as will protect the Government
from fraud, and secure to the honorably-discharged sol?
dier the well-earned, reward of his faithfulness and gal?
lantry. More than six thousand maimed soldiers have
received artificial limbs or other surgical apparatus; and
forty-one national cemeteries, containing the remains of
104,526 Union soldiers, have already been established.
2M669 ee?mate for military appropriations is $25,
j4 testeten in toe ^P01* ofth6 Secretary of the Navy
that the naval fore? at this time consists of twoTrandred
and seventy-eight vessels, armed with two thousand
three hundred and fifty-one guns. Of these, one hun?
dred and fifteen vessels, carrying, one thousand and
twenty-nine guns, are in commission, distributed chiefly
among seven squadrons. The number of men in the
eervtoe is thirteen thousand six hundred. Great activity

-undergoing repairs, or are laid up until toelsiervicca
may be required. Most of the ir?n-claa fleet is at teague

fund amounts to $11,750,000, having been increased S2 -
750,000 during the year. The expenditures of the T>?
partment for the fiscal year ending 30th Jone last were
$43,324,628, and the estimates for toe coming year amount
to $23,568,486. Attention is invited toto? condition of
our seamen, and the Importance Of legislative measures
foi? toeterelief and improvement Tho suggestions in be?
half of this deserving class of our fellow-citizens are
earnestly recommended to the favorable attention of Con?
gress. .
The report of the Postmaster General presents a most
satisfactory condition of toe postal service, and submits
recommendatione which deserve toe consideration of '
Congress. The revenues of toe Department for the year
ending June 30,1866, were $14,886,988, and the expendi
?^Jr5,i62'OT9,,'mowlll8 811 ?cesa of toe latter of
$965,093. Da anticipation of this deficiency, however, a
special appropriation was made by Congress in the act
approved July 28,1866. tocluding toe standing appro?
priation of 8700,000 for free mail matter, aTategitimate
portion of tho revenues yet remaining unexpended, the
1^??^ ior 010 P*8* Juxte only$265.003-<Tsum
witoin $61,141 of the amount ostimated In the annual re?
port of 1864. The decrease of revenue compared with
toe previous year, was one and one-fifth per cent, and the
tacrease of expenditures, owing principally to the enlarge?
ment of the mail service tn the South, was twelve per cent
On the 80th of Jane last t.uere were in opt ration, six
thousand sin? hundred aad thirty neall routes, with an
adgr -{tate length of one hundred and eighty thousand
nine hundred and twenty one mites, an aggregate sn.
natl transportation of seventy-one million eijiht hundred
ard thirty-seven thonsaud nine hundred and fourteen
miles, and an aggregate annual coat, tocluding ali ox
penditurea, o? $8,410,184. The length of railroad route 8
is thirty-two thousand and ninety-two miles, and th?
annual transportation thirty million six hundred and
nine thousand four hundred and> sixty-seven miles.
The length of steamboat routes is fourteen thousand
I three hundred and forty-six miles, and the annual
transportation three million four hundred aud elovon
thousand nine hundred and sixty-two miles. The mail
j service is rapidly increasing throughout the
whole country, and its steady extension in the Southern
States indicates their constantly improving condition.
Ibo growing importance ol the foreign s rvice also
merits attention. Tho PostorBco Department of Great
Britain and our own have agreed upon a preliminary
basis for anew Postal Convention, which Ur is believed
will prove eminently baneficial to the commercial inter?
ests of the United States, inasmuch as it contemplates
a reduction of the international letter postage to one
half the existing rates; a reduction of postage with alt
other countries to and from which correspondence ls
transmitted in the British mail, or ia closed mails
through the United Kingdom ; thc establishment of uni.
form and reasonable charges fur the sea and territorial
transit of correspondence in closed mails; and'an al-;
lo war ce to each Posto mee Department of the ri? ht to
use all mail communications established under tho au?
thority of the other for the dispatch of correspondence,
either in open or closed mails, on the same terms as
those applicable to the inhabitants bf the coun?
try providing the means of transmission.. . .-.
Tho report of the Secretary of thelnteriqr exhibits the
condition of those branches ' of the public service which
are committed to his supervision. During the last fiscal
year, four million six hundred and twenty-nine thousand' '?
three hundred and twelve acres of public- land were dis- ?
posed of, one million eight hundred and nmsty-two thou?
sand ?vc hundred and sixteen acres of which were en?
tered under the homestead act. The policy- originally
adopted relative to the public lands has undergone essen?
tial modifications. Immediate revenue, ' and not their.
! rapid settlement, was the cardinal feature bf our land
system. Dong experience ftnd earnest discussion have
resulted in the conviction that the early development of
our agricultural resources, and the diffusion of an ener?
getic copulation over our vast territory, are.obje.cts of
far g-caier tmportarice to the -national growth and pros?
perity than Ute proceeds of the sale of t?te land to the'
highest bidder in open market. The_.pre-emption laws
confer upon the pioneer who complies with the'ferjfts
they impose the privilege of purchasing ^ limited portion i
of "unoffered lands" at the minimum price.The home?
stead enactments relievo the settler from the ;pay??enTof
pechase" money, and secure him a permanent hom o
upon the condition of residence for. a term of years. This
liberal policy mvitos^gmigration from the old, and from,
the more crowd?dportiohs- ?TThe new World. Its' pro?
pitious results arc undoubted, and will be moro signally
manifested when time shall have given to it a wider de?
velopment. . '? ' .'.-' ?' ? "..- .;" -
. Congress has made liberal grants of public land to cor- '
porations, in aid of the construction' of ?aihSaads and
other internal improvements. Should1 tins TOfioyhere
' after prevail, more stringent provisions yoB. be required
to secure a faithful application of the funfL Th? title to
the lands should not pass, by patent or otherwise, but
remain in the Government and subject to ita control un?
til some portion of the road has been actually built. Por?
tions of them might then, from time to time, be conveyed
to the corporation, but never in a greater ratio to the '
whole quantity embraced by the grant than' the completed
parts bear to the entire length of the projected' improve?
ment This ^restriction would not operate to-the preju?
dice of any undertaking conceived in good faith and exe?
cuted with reasonable energy, as it is the settled practice
to withdraw from market the lands falling within the ope?
ration of such grants, and thus to exclude the inception,
of a subsequent adverse right. A breach of the condi?
tions'which Congress may deem proper to impose should
work a forfeiture of claim to the lands so withdrawn'.bnt
un conveyed, and of title to the lands', conveyed Which rer

Operations on the several lines of the PJK^O- Railroad

confidently, anticipated that this great thoroughfare will
be completed before the expiration of - tho period desig?
nated by Congress. .-'.'- ',v--':"
-During the last fiscal year the amount: paid to pen?
sioners, including the expenses of disbursement, was

tone hundred and seventy-seven names were'added to the

_ -AB a subject upon which, dependa an immense-amount
i of the production and commerce of the country, I recom?
mend to Congress such legislation as may be-necessary.
I for the preservation cf the levees of the Mississippi Riv?
er.. It is a matter of national importance that early steps
j' should be taken not only to add to the efficiency of these
barriers against destructive inundations, but for the re
xnoval of all obstructions to the free and safe navigation
' of that great channel of trade and commerce.
The District of Columbia, under existing laws, is not
entitled to that representation in the National Councils
which, from our earliest history, has been uniformly ac?
corded to each Territory established from tim? to time
within"our limite. It maintains peculiar relations to
Congress, to -whom the Constitution has granted the
power of exercising exclusive legislation over the seat of
government. Our fellow-citizens residing in the Dis?
trict, whose interests are thus confided io the special
guardianship of Congress, exceed in number the popu?
lation of several of our Territories, and no just reason is
perceived why a delegate of their choice should not be
admitted to a seat in the House of Representatives. No
mode seems so .appropriate and effectual of enabling
them to make known their peculiar condition andsrants,
and of securing the local legislation adapted to them. I
I therefore recommend the passage of a law authorizing
the electors of the District of Columbia to choose a dele
< gate, to be allowed the same rights and privileges as a
! delegate representing a Territory. The increasing enter?
prise and rapid progress of impiuvemex?jn??he District
axe highly gratifying, and I trust that the efforts, of the
municipal authorities to promote" the prosperity of the -
i national metropolis will receive the efficient and gener?
ous co-operation of Congress.
1 The report of the Commissioner of Agri-altpre re?
views the operations of his Department dur n?"the past
year, and asks the aid of Congress in its efforts to en?
courage those sutes which, scourged by war, are now
earnestly engaged in the reorganization of domestic in?
dustry.
It is a subject of congratulation that co foreign com?
binations against our domestic peace and safety, or our
legitima-e influence among the nations, have been form?
ed or. attempted. While sentiments of reconciliation,
loyalty, ant pitrioiism have increased at borne, a more
just consideration of our national character and rights
has been manifested by foreign nations..
The entire success of the Atlantic^ Telegraph between
the coast of Ireland and the Province of "Newfoundland,
issn achievement which has been- justly- -celebrated in
both hemispheres as the opening of an era in the progress
of civilization. There is reason to expect that equal suc?
cess will attend, and even. greater- results follow, the en?
terprise for connecting the tero Continents through the
Pacific Ocean by the projected line of telegraph between
Ramschntka and the Russian possessions in Am erica.
The resolution of Congress protesting against pardons
by foreign Governments of persons convicted of infamous
offences, on condition of emigration to our country, has
been communicated to the States with which we maintain
intercourse, and the-practice, so justly the subject of
complaint on our part, has not been renewed.
The congratulations of Congress to the Etaperor of.
Russia, upon his escape from attempted assaafflSStloh,
have'been presented to that humane and enlightened
ruler, and received by him with expressions of grateful
appreciation.:
The Executive, warned of an . attempt by Spanish
American adventurers to induce theenugration of freed
mimoftbe Unitedj?tetes" te S loreign cogs?ry7~prot?8led
ag?lhst'^TSrot?ot^ would
reduce them to ? bondage even more I oppressive than
that from which they have just been relieved. Assur?
ance has been received from the Government of the State
in which the pl was matured, that tte proceeding will
meet neither tts encouragement nor approval. It is a
question worthy of your consideration, whether our laws
upon this subject are adequate to the prevention or pun?
ishment of the crime thus meditated:
In the mouth of April last,- as Congress ia- aware, a
friendly arrangement was mads between the Emperor
of France and the President of the United States for the,
withdrawal from-Mexico of the French expeditionary
military forces. Tras withdrawal was to be effected in.
? three detachment?, the first of which, it was understood,
would leave Mexico in November, DOW psst, the second
in if arch next, and the third and last in November, 1867.
Immediately upon the 'completion of the evacuation, the I
French Government was to assume the same attitude of
non-lntetventioh, in ree ard to Mexico, as ls held by the
Government of the United States. Repeated assurances
have beengiven by the Emperor, since that agreement,
that he would complete the pron,istd evacuation Within
the period mentioned, or sooner. .
It was reasonably expected that the proceedings thus
contemplated would produce ? crisis of-great political
interest in the Republic of Mexico. The newly-appoint?
ed Minister of the United States, Mr. Campbell, was
therefore sent forward, on tho 9th day of November last,
to assume his proper functions as Minister Plenipoten?
tiary of the United 8tates to Shat Republic lt was also
thought expedient that he should bo attended in the
vicinity of Mexico by the Iieutenant-General of the
Army of the United States, with a view of obtaining such
information aa might be important to determine the
course to be pursued by the United States in re-establish?
ing and maintaining necessary and proper intercourse
with the Republic of Mexico. Deeply interested in the
cause of liberty and humanity, it seemed an obvious duty
on our part to exercise whatever influence we possessed
for the restoration and permanent establishment in that
country of a domestic and republican form of govern?
ment.
Such was the condition of affairs in regard to Mexico,
when, on the 23d of-November last, official information
was received from Baris that the Emperor of France had
some time before decided not to withdraw a detachment
of bis forces in the month of November past, according
to engagement, but that this decision wah made with the
purpoi i of withdrawing the whole of those forces in the
ensuing spring. Of thia determination, however, the
United States had not received any notice or Intimation;
end, so soon aa tho Information was received by tho Gov
ernmcnt, care was taken to make known its dissent to the
Emperor of France.
I cannot forego the hope that Franco will reconsider the
subject, and adopt some resolution in regard to the evac?
uation of Mexico which will conform as nearly as prac?
ticable with the existing engagement, and thus meet tho
just expectations of the United States. The papers relat?
ing to the subject will be laid before you. It is believed
that, with the evacuation of Mexico by the expeditionary
forces, no subject for serious differences between France
and the United States would remain. The expressions of
the Emperor and people of France warrant a hope that
the traditionary friendship between the two countries
might In that case be renewed and permanently restored.
A claim of a citizen ot the United States for ind> mni
tv for spoliations committed on the high seas by the
French authorities, in the exercise of a belliRerent pow?
er against Mexico, bas bsen met by the Government of
France with a proposition to defer settlement until a
mutual convention for the adjustment of all dal ms of
citizens and subjects of both countries, arising out of
the recent wars on this Continent, shall be agreed upon
by the two countries. The uugyei-t on is not deemed
unreasonable, but it belongs to Congress to direct the
manner in which claims for indemnity by foreigners, as
well .as by citizens of the United States, arising out of
the late civil war, shall bo adjudicated and determined.
I have no doubt that the subject of all such claims will
engage your attention at a convenient and proper time.
It is a matter of regret that no considerable advance
has been made toward ah adjustment of "the differences
between the United States and Great Britain, arising out
cf the depredations upon pur national commerce and
other trespasses cbmmitted during our civil war by Brit?
ish subjects, in violation of international law and treaty
obligations. The delay, however, may be believed to
have resulted in no small degree -from toe domestic sit?
uation of. Great Britain An entire change of ministry
occurred to that country during 'the last session of Par?
liament. Thc attention of the new ministry was called
to the subject -at an early day, and there is. some reason
to expect that it will now be considered-to ?beComing
and" friendly spirit.' The "importance of an " early disposi?
tion- of the question cannot be exaggerated. Whatever
might be toe wishes of the two Governments, it is mani?
fest that good-will and friendship between toe two coun?
tries cannot be established until a reciprocity, in toe
practice of good faith' and neutrality, shall be restored
between the respective nations. *- '
On toe G th of June last, in violation of our neutrality
laws, a military, expedition and enterprise against the
British W?rth American Colonies'was projected and at?
tempted to be carried on within the territory and juris?
diction of the United-States'. In obedience to the obliga?
tion imposed upon toe -Executive by the Constitution, to
see that the laws'.are faithfully -executed, all citizens
were warned, by proclamation, against, taking part. in or
aiding such unlawful proceedings, and toe proper civil,
n?Utary, and- naval officers were directed to take-all
necessary measures for the enforcement of toe laws. -The
expedition failed,' but it has not been without - its painful
consequences. Some of our citizens who, it was.alleged,
were engaged in toe expedition,, were captured, and have
been brought to trial, as for _ a capital offence, to the
Province of Canada.
- Judgment and sentence of-death have been pronounc?
ed against some, while others have been acquitted. Fully
believing-in toe maxim of government, that severity of
civil punishment for misguided persons who have en?
gaged in revolutionary attempts which, have disastrously
failed, is unsound and unwise, such representations have
been made to toe British Government, in behalf of toe
convicted persons, as, being sustained by an enlighten?
ed and humane judgment, w?l, it' is hoped, induce in
their cases an exercise of clemency, and a judicious am?
nesty to all who were engaged in toe movement. Counsel
has been employed by toe Government to defend citizens
of the United Stetes ontrialfor capital offences in Canada;
and: a discontinuance of toe prosecutions which were in?
stituted in toe courts of toe United States against those
who took part in toe expedition, has been directed. -
I have regarded toe expedition aa not only political in
its nature, but as also, in a great measure, foreign from
toe ' United States to its causes, character and objects.
The-attempt was understood'to be made in sympathy
with an insurgentfparty in Ireland, and, by striking at a
British-Province on this Continent? was designed to aldin
obtaining redress for political grievances which, it was
assumed, toe people of Ireland hsd suffered at the hands
of the British Government during a period of several
centuries. The persons engaged in it were chiefly na?
tives of that country, some of.whom had, while others
had not, become citizens of the United States under, our
general laws of naturalization. Complaints of misgov?
ernment in Ireland continually engage the attention of
the British nation, and so great an agitation is now pre?
vailing in Ireland that the British Government have
deemed it necessary to suspend toe writ of habeas corpus
in that country.
" These circumstances must necessarily modify the opin?
ion which we might otherwise hav? entertained in regard
to an expedition expressly prohibited by our neutrality
laws. So long as those laws remain upon our statute
books, they should ba faithfully executed, and if they
operate harshly, unjustly, or oppressively, Congress alone
can apply toe remedy, by their modification or repeal.
' Political and commercial interests of the United. States
are not-unlikely to be affected in some degree by events
which are transpiring in-the eastern regions of Europe,
and the time seems to have come when our Government
ought to have a proper diplomatic .repfesenlation in
Greece.
This Government has daimait for all persons not con?
victed, or accused, or suspected of crime, an absolute
potmcat **>h* of - self-expatriation, and a choice of new
nations! aliegimcd. " Most oftHS European States have
dissented from this principle, ?nd have claimed a right
to hold such of their subjects as have immigra: ed to
and been naturalized in thc United Si a-es, and after?
wards returned'on transient visits to their native conn
tries, to the performance of military eervice ia like man?
ner as resident subjects. Compliints arising from the
claim In this respeot made by foreign States, have here?
tofore been matters of controversy between the United
States and some of the European Powers, and the irrita?
tion consequent upon the failure to settle this question
increased during the war in which Prussia, Italy and
Austria were recently engaged.
While Great Britain has never acknowledged toe right
of expatriation, she has not practically insisted upon it.
France has been equally forbearing; and Prussia has
proposed a compromise, which, although evincing in?
creased liberality, has not been accepted by the United
States. Peace is now prevailing everywhere in Europe,
and toe present seems to be. a favorable ama for on as-,
Bertion by Congress of toejtmncijde, so long maintained
by the Executive Deparftrienf, "Shat najnraiization by one
State fully exempts the native born "subject or any other
State from the performance of military service under
any foreign Government, so long as he does not volunta?
rily renounce its rights and benefits.
In toe performance of a duty imposed upon moby the
Constitution, I have thus submitted to the Representa?
tives of the States and of th? People such information
of our domestic and foreign aff .irs as the public interests
seem to require. Our Government is now undergoing
its most trying ordeal, and my earnest prayer in, that
the peril may be successfully and finally passed, without
impairing 1 .a original strength and symmetry. The in*
forests ol the nation are best to be promoted by the re?
vival of fraternal relations, the complete obliteration of
our. past differences, and the rein augur?t ion of all toe
pursuits of peace. Directing our efforts to the eariy
accomplishment of these great ends, let us endeavor to
preserve harmony between the coordinate Departments
of the Government, that each in its proper sphere may
cordially co-operate with the other in securing the main?
tenance of the Constitution, the" pr?servation cf the
Union, and toa perpetuity of our free institutions.
