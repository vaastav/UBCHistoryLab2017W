Are Shy and Noncommittal
New York Dec sA special to the
Journal and Advertiser from Washing I
ton says I
A reporter having made a Doll of
conprrrss on the most vital Questions
likely to come before that body at this
session below is given the exact ques
tions submitted to the members with a
summary of the votes
F The following proposition was sub
t
r niittod to the members of the house
Do you favor retirement of the green
backs
The surprise in the vote upon this
A proposition was in that fact that such
Rppubl loans as Belknap Dolliver
Odell Henderson Mesick Bruce and
Hopkins were found in opposition Not
a single Populist of course favored the
proposition while Brenner of Ohio and
Kitchen were the only Democrats in its
favor
The following proposition was sub
mitted to the senate
UNANIMOUS SENTIMENT
Csn any radical financial legislation
imolving the retirement of the green
backs the limitation of the legal ten
der quality of silver or the issuing of
gold bonds for the retirement of green
backs pass the senate
There was practically a unanimous
sentiment that nothing can be done
The negatives were largely in the ma
jority and the doubt expressed by cer
J tain senators virtually meant a nega
tive To the senate upon the matter
of annexation this proposition was
submitted
I Do you favor the annexation of
Hawaii HAWAIIAN ANNEXATION
Not a single straight Republican was I
found in opposition but Cannon and
Pettigrew the silver senators voted in
favor of it All the leaders of the Demo
cratic party were opposed with the ex
ccmion of Morgan Pettus Rawlins and
Turpie
The next vote was taken upon the ar
bitration question
Do you favor the general arbitration
treaty with Great Britain
Among the Republicans in the nega
1r tive were Elkins Fvye and Baker go
ing vith Cockrell Mills Morgan and
Murphy among the leaders of the
Democrats The greater lights in the
Republican party who leaned toward I
an affirmative view were Allison Fora
ker Hale Hanna Hawley Morrlll and
H ar
But many of the senators who wished
to be reorded in the affirmative quali
fwd their declarations by conditions
and estimations as to exactly what
su < h a treaty should comprise and
whet its exact conditions might be
I
o CUBAN QUESTIONS
Upon the Cuban Question these two i
J
propositions were submitted to mem
bers 01 the house of representatives
Do you favor the joint resolution
passed by the senate at the extra ses
sion declaring that a state of war exists
in Cuba
Dc you favor a resolution acknowl
edging the independence of Cuba
The first proposition seemed to meet
with the view of the greater portion of
thv known friends of the insurgents
although the Republicans were far be
hind the Democrats Among those on
the Republican roll who voted for the
proposition were Belknap Boutelle
Danforth Davenport Dorr Grow Rob
bins Henry of Indiana and Overstreet
All the Democratic leaders favored it
Such men as Bailey Bland Benton
Eremenlrout and Taylor of Alabama
b ing found among the positive friends
p of belligerency for the gallant patriots
2 of Sp ins beleaguered colony
Friends of Cuba appeared to be a bit
shy of the bold suggestion of Cuban in
dependence probably for the reason
that the first proposition having passed
the senate it affords the means of
nn ire direct action and through the
far that the congressional recognition I
I of Cuba independence might lead to
complications with Spain which the I
other move would avoid I

against hope that she may show a

THE TREATY IN DOUBT
Various Reasons Given Against
Hawaiian Annexation
SOUTHERN OPPOSITION
BASED ON FEAR OF REPUBLI
CAN ADVANTAGE
Canvass of the Senators Reveals
That a Total of ThirtyFive or
More Than Enough to Defeat the
Treaty Are Opposed to the Meas
ure Kanaka Women
Chicago Dec SA special to the
Tribune from Washington says
If a vote could be taken today the
propostition to annex the Hawaiian I
Island would undoubtedly fail to se
cure the necessary twothirds majori
ty This is the result of an informal
canvass of the senate made since the
opening by senators who are more or
less favorable to the project They say
that thus far not over half a dozen of
the Democrats have announced them
selves as being openly in favor of the
treaty There are about ten of the
same party who are admittedly on the
fence At the present time they would
vote against the treaty in all probabil
ities but are expected to be won over
in the course of the debate The re
mainder of the Democrats numbering
18 or so are apparently hostile to the
annexation for various reasons
SOUTHERN OPPOSITION
Many of the southern serators it is
said oppose annexation because they
fear that the Republicans will ulti
mately secure political advantage by
the annexation of the islands Of the
Republicans in the senate by far the
greater proportion accept Hawaiian
annexation as an established Repub
lican doctrine There are however
quite a number especially from New
England who are opposed to annexa
tion of any more territory by the
United States
SIXTY VOTES REQUIRED
The full membership of the senate
is 90 It therefore requires 60 votes to
pass the treaty as a treaty and with
out resorting to the subterfuge of a
joint resolution Thirtyone senators
can defeat the treaty entirely and a
much smaller number if sufficiently
belligerent can prevent action for a
long enough time The opponents of
annexation say that at the present
time they can count on 25 Democratic
senators seven Republicans and three
independents making a total of 35 or
more than enough to defeat the treaty
There are many senators who believe
that by withholding their votes on Ha
waii they may be able to force the
president and his advisors to do some
thing for Cuba
V u V >
KANAKA WOMEN
Representative Tawney of Minnesota
who visited Hawaii in company with
Uncle Joe Cannon says it is the women
among the natives who are opposing
annexation The reason is he says
they have an eye to future social
prestige The native women are now I I
recognized as the equals of the white
I
women and are classed in the same so
cial set There is a disposition on the
part of the white women however to
class the native females as negroes
and the natives believe that annexa
tion will increase the number of white
women in the islands to such an extent
that eventually they will le relegated
to the negro class entirely The na
tive women are doing everything in
their power to arouse a sentiment
against annexation I
JOINT RESOLUTION
Washington Dec 8It is stated by
those in a position to know that the
reason that the Hawaiian treaty is not
pushed in the senate is because the
friends of the measure have grave
doubts as to their ability to secure the
necessary twothirds vote to pass it
The impression prevails that it may
be necessary to pass a joint resolution
and annex the islands by legislation
It has been found that a number of
I
senators who were counted for the
I
treaty are against it while others have I
expressed doubts about the hasty ac
tion

Concerning President McKinleyr

annexation of Hawaii Mr Hoshi de
clined to express any views beyond
reiterating what he said at the outset
that there would be no disposition on
the part of Japan to resist the acqui
sition of Hawaii by the United States
but that he hoped to be able through
diplomatic negotiations to bring abou
a peaceable solution of the matters ir

Was On His Knees
Waverly la Dec 8 Delilah Fales
has confessed her share in the tragic

confessed that she fired the bullets that
killed him She was indicted today
and it is said that her alleged accom
plice before the fact William Kern a
son of the victim will be indicted to
morrow
When she was a mere child of 13
years she charges that the elder Kern
betrayed her and that ever after he
harassed her with his attentions More
than that he sought by blackmailing
her reputation she states to keep
others trom paying court to her Twice
before she became attached to the mur
dered mans son she had been in a fair
way to become happily married but as
many times had Jerome Kern she de
clares poisoned her lovers against her
At last when by the same method he
sought to prevent his son from mar
rying her the pentup hatred of years
vented itself in the commission of the
crime
I killed him with premeditation and
deliberation she said I prayed God
to give me strength to do it with all
the earnestness that I could command
as I have prayed to him for forgive
ness I have suffered no pangs of con
science On the contrary a restful
calm seemed to come into my life from
the moment I knew he was dead I
never slept so well as I did after the
night I fired those fatal shots
