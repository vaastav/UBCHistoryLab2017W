PEACE.
Spain Accedes to Demands of the
United States—Terms of the Protocol
Agreed Upon—The Virginius to be Surrendered
and the Remaining Captives
Released.
Negotiations between the United States and
Spain with regard to questions growing out of
tho capture of the Virginius were brought to
a conclusion on the 29th ult., Secretary Fish
and the Spanish Admiral Polo having Bigned
protocol, the terms of which are substantially
as follows :
First Immediate delivery to the United
States of tho ship Virginius and all tho sur
viving passengers and crew.
Second A salute to our flag on the 25th of
December nest, unless in the meantime Spain
shall satisfy the United States that the Ameri
can flag was improperly borne on that vessel ;
and further, that she had ho right to the
American: nae or American papers. In this
event, the salute is to be spontaneously with
drawn, una tbpain is to formally disclaim any
intentional indicnity to the flag in the acts
committed by Spain against the Virginius.
xnira n it snail tnus be snown tuat the
Virginius had no right to carry the American
nag ana papers, the united states will insti
tute proceedings against the vessel and the
surviving parties who nave violated tne laws
of the United States, and Spain guarantees to
institute proceedings against any of her au
thorities w ho may have violated either law or
treaty stipulations.
Fourth The matter of reclamatious for
damages is reserved for future consideration.
me words "immediate mease, as applica
ble to the delivery of the Virginius and the
surviving passengers and crew, imply, of
course, a reasonable time for its execution, as
some days must elapse before Havana and
Santiago de uuba can be reached.
The nxing of the zotn of December as the
time of saluting our flag is to allow tho neces
sary opportunity to - Spain to show that the
Virginius improperly carried the American flag
ana American papers.
A Madrid disbatch states that the Sbanish
Cabinet has agreed to deliver to the United
States Government the steamship Virginius
ana ail tue persons remaining alive wno were
captured with her, leaving the question
whether the seizure oi the vessel was legal to
be settled hereafter by a mixed tribunal. The
question whethor the damages shall be paid to
tne famines or relatives or tne men wno were
shot is also to be settled in a similar manner.
This decision waa not arrived at by the Span-
i8ii uoverument before it Had confidentially
consulted with the powers of Europe, and was
informed by all or them tnat reparation was
due for the capture of the steamer and the ex
ecution of the captives. The decision is also
in couformity with the opinion of leading
Sianish statesmen, of all parties, to whom the
question was submitted by tne government.
A Havana telegram of tne 1st mat. savs
there is much excitement in that city over the
settlement of the difficulty, and the terms
upon which it is based.
Tne ciiiti authorities of tne inland, assem
bled iu conference, sent a manifesto to the
Spanish Government, asking it to wait until
it shall have received a statement about the
Virginius case, which shows the right of the
capture -and the justice of subsequent pro
ceedings. The mass of tho people oppose the
surrender or tne virginius, or any yielding to
pretensions which may dishonor the Spanish
nag.
TERRIBLE DISASTER.
A New York Steamship Sunk at Sea—226
of Her Passengers Lost.
News comes from London of another terri
ble marine disaster. . At 2 o'clock on the morn
ing of tho 23d of November, the steamship
Ville du Havre, which left New York Nov. 15,
for Havre, France, collided with the British
ship XiOcli me. and sunk in twelve minutes,
Two hundred and twenty-six passengers of the
Ville du Havre were lost, eighty-seven being
saved bv the ship Trimountaiu. The ill-fated
vessel was struck amidships by the Loch Erne.
The latter vessel immediately lowered her
bosts, which rendered all the service possible
bv them. Filty-tnree of tne crew were saved.
including tbe Captain, and those go to make
up the eighty-seven saved. Among the pas
sengers lost were several members of the
late Evangolical Alliance, returning to their
homes.
The Ville du Havre was one of the largest
and finest Bteamers afloat. Her dimensions
were 480 feet by 48 feet. Her carrying capac
ity was 3,500 tons, freight and measurement.
Her main saloon was litted up with marble
wainscoting of three varieties, the uphol
stery was velvet, and tho wood-work was
carved in the most unique designs. Her en
gines were compound direct-acting, of 3,200
horse-power, and made in England.
Among the lost were four children of Mr.
H. G. til-afford (Mrs. S. being among the
saved), a son of Mr. B. F. Culver, and Mrs.
Daniel Goodwin and 'two children all of
Chicago.
The Loch Erne struck the steamer amid
ships, and made a chasm 12 feet deep and
from 25 to 30 feet wide. Tho exact position
of tbe Ville du Havre at the time was latitude
47 degrees 21 minutes ; longitude 35 degrees
41 minutes.
Panic took possession of tho passengers.
Five minutes after the collision the main and
mizzen masts fell across two large boats
which were filled with people and ready ior
launching. Tho boats were crushed to pieces,
and many oi tue occupants Kiuea ana mjurou.
In the brief interval between the collision and
sinking of the steamer the crew were able to
launch only a whaleboat and the Captain's
8 The Loch Erne went a mile before stopping.
She then got out feur boats to pick up the
people struggling in tne water.
The Purser of tho Ville du Havre, in his ac
ennnt of the dieaBter. savs :
The scene was awful, ana beyona descrip
tion. The air was rent with shriekB, but some
were heard savine calmlv. " As we must die,
let us die nobiv. ' Tue water rusnea into tue
hold with incredible velocity. I undressad
myself, and with a conrpanion, jumped over
board and swam toward the Loch Erne, then
half a mile distant. As I left I heard the ship
cracking, and looking back saw her go down
with ono plunge forward. For a moment tho
slirieKS were ternDle, then all was silent, it
was the silence of death. The Captain re
mained on the bridge of the Ville du Havre
during the whole, and went down with the
ehip. He was picked up an hour afterward."
THE NAVY.
Secretary Robeson's Report—The United
States Navy Inferior to That of Any
Respectable Power—Results of the Polaris
Expedition—The Death of Capt.
Hall.
The Secretary Navy, report
the President says there are now in the navy
165 vessels, carrying, exclusive of howitzers,
1,269 gnns, a reduction since his last annual
report, by sale and otherwise, of thirteen
vessels.
A general enumeration of these vessels
presents 63 steamers other than iron-clads
and tugs, carrying 82G guns ; 23 sailing ves
sels, with 332 guns ; -lrt iron-clad vessels,
with 121 guns : and 25 tugs used for navy-
yard aud freight purposes. Of this number,
there are at present in commission for sea
service, distributed on the several foreign
stations, and on our own coast 46 vessels,
carrying 407 guns. The cruisiag or active
force of the navy, as they may be called, and
which is controlled by the appropriations made
and the seamen authorized by law, is about
tne Bame as last year.
Mix of our live-oan cruising snips are now in
various stages of forwardness at the several
navy yards. These are all of moderate size,
and none of tnem sumcientiy aavancea to De
of present use, but tliev are adapted to the
wants of of our cruising naw, and will, in a
few weeks, add materially to its strength and
efficiency. The eight sloops of war author
ized by the last Congress are all in process of
building. The valuable work thuB begun
should not be discontinued, but the Depart
ment should he provided with a moderate
amount of funds and authorized to commence
each year to build a certain number of tons,
to supply regularly the regular yearly expen
diture oi tne navai rorce, wniun will oi neces
sity, occur. The work of putting our iron
clad force in efficient condition, referred to in
the Secretary's last report, has been proceed
ed with as fast as the means necessary for the
extraordinary work could be spared f rum the
current appropriations for the suppoi t of tbe
navy. The wisdom of this action needs no
illustration from him at this time. Without it
we should have been left not only powerless
to assert our own ngnts, but almost defence
less against arrogance or aggression.
Tbe Secretary says the naval force on the
North Atlantic Station was reduced in the
spring and summer by ordering north as a
necessity some of the vessels which were
much in need of repairs, and whose crews
peeded a change, having been long in the
tropics.
The expedition for the survey of the Darien
and Inter-Oceanic Canal has completed its
duties and submitted its reports.
The Secretary, in speaking of the Polaris,
says her cruise has been decidedly the most
successful of Arctic expeditions. The geo
graphical knowledge of the Arctic regions
has been largely advanced by it. A very par
ticular questioning of eveiy one of the officers
and crew of the Polaris, and of the scientific
corps, except the three persons yet unexam
ined, has completely l alia tied his associates
and himself that Capt. Hall's death occurred
from purely natural causes ; that his medical
treatment was Judiciously adapted to his case,
and that be was tenderly nursed and cared fcr
to the last.
The evidence has also made it manifest that
Capt. Hall wasralwavs faithful to the trust re
posed in him in assigning him to the command
of the expedition ;' that he was kind, firm,
and humane in the exercise of his authority ;
that he was earnest in his desire and in his
attempts to reach a high northern latitude,
and if practicable, the Pole itself ; and that
his untimely death was: an irreparable loss to
the expedition. It is also apparent that Capt.
Buddington, who succeeded to the chief com
mand on tho death of Capt. Hall, proved him
self to be a good seaman, and that in all dan
gerous positions in which the Polaris was
placed his conduct as the commander was
skillful and judicious the natural result of
long experience at sea and in command in
northern latitudes.
The Secretary renews the recommendation
that the forces in our navy yards be increased
and developed so that we may be prepared for
ail emergencies : that the old navy yard at
Philadelphia be abandoned, and new buildings
erected at League Island ; that the New York
yard be preserved in its present site, and that
the Pensacola yard be, in a measure, rebuilt.
The Secretary earnestly recommends that
ample provisions bo made for tho Bupport of
the Ordnunce Bureau, in order that nothing
may interfere with the efforts to supply our
ships with tbe most powerful guns.
The estimates for the next Ureal year are
$19,252,235, and fo this is added the 'sua of
864,539 for the current repairs of buildings,
docks, and incidental expenses in the navy
yards, etc. Thess estimates are less than
those of last year by rather more than $2,000,
000, but they do not include any extraordinary
expenditure for the permanent improvement
of the navy, nor amounts necessary for the
repairs of our iron-clad fleet, nor for the con
tinned prosecution of some of the great works
necessary to a proper condition of our naval
establishment.
Since the conimoi:ceinent. of the presont
month events have taken place which make
it proper that the navy should be put at once
upon a footing for active service. It is by no
means the province of this Department, as
such, to take part in the conduct or discus
sion of any diplomatic question, nor should
its attitude, at a time wtien serious interna
tional difficulties are possible, be held to in
dicate anything more than a determination
on the part of a military department of
the Government to bo prepared for ac
tion should the necessity for action arise. A
respectable force of war vessels aud moni
tors is already on the sea and concentrating
at the statious nearest the scene of our pos
sible difficulties. Our whole available iron
clad fleet is on .hand, and every wooden war
vessel that will float is in active preparation
at the various naval stations. These will be
ready for sea, fully fitted, as fast as proper
crews can be provided for tlicm, and. if the
necessity for action uhould come befoi6 the
time for it arrives, all thero is of the Ameri
can navy which can be put afloat on the At
lantic Ocean, will be in condition and position
to take its proper part.
" Inadequate," says the Secretary, " as this
force may be deemed to the responsibilities
and pretensions of a Government like ours,
and greatly at a disadvantage, as we certainly
shall be in respect to the number aud charac
ter of our vessels iu a contest with the fleets
of any respectable i.aval power, I believe
th t the activity, skill, science, and experi
ence of our navy will be found equal to any
difficulty which courage dare to moot or
energy will avail to conquer."
Tbe Secretary concludes as follows : ' In
taking the action above referred to, the Navy
Department has already incurred considerable
expense, and has been forced to assume re
sponsibilities unusual in times of peace; but,
convinced of the wisdom of prompt and deci
ded action, I have not shrunk from those re
sponsibilities, nor hesitated, with tho ap
proval of the President, to make warlike
preparations in the interests of peace and hu
manity. I confidently rely for support in
this attitude upon the patriotism and good
sense of the American people and their rep
resentatives, who cannot fail to rememljer
tbat our naval condition is the result of
causes which have been constantly pressed
unon their consideration, but wrhich have
failed to receive full attention, doabt
less ou account of moio pressing pres
ent requirements aud obligations, and
who will clearly realize that duties constantly
postponed are certain to be more difficult anil
much more expensive when performem in
haste under tho pressure of imperious neces
sity. The Department has had iionecesnity to
overstep its appropriations, even if it were
lawful to do so, but the pressing demands of
the present will consume now what was pro
vided for the service of the year iu several of
the working bureaus. These must be prompt
ly relieved, if their work is to go on. The oc
casion has already shown, I think, that our
navy, as it exists, should at least be put in a
condition for active service ; and in any event
a moderate appropriation for this purpose
outrht at once to bo made, and, if war should
by any possibility come, we uiuui uu uueiauy
provided to utilize means we have, and to
provide others to meet the emergency.

serve supply in case of war. it is recom
mended that tho appropriation for arming
and equipping tne militia be increased in pro
portion to the increasing population since the
passage oi tne act.ot xoxio.
Cities on the sea-coast, it is stated, are in a
very defenseless condition, and the Secretary
calls the earnest attention of Congress to the
fact, suggesting that $1,500,000, the estimate
of the Cnief of Ordnance, be appropriated to
put tbem in a sta'e of defense, and says this
sum will only provide the defenses with one
sixth of tbe complement of guns required for
the omerent lortincations.
' The nurchase of a proving-ground for ex
periments in heavy guns is advised; also, an
appropriation of 75,000 for the manufacture
and trial ot 12-iucn cast-iron nmmea can
non.
A large powder depot, it is recommended.
should be established in some region where
neither private nor public interests would be
endangered, and away from the influence of
salt air. and lor tne purcnase oi a Bite and
commencement of magazines $100,000
should be appropriated. In the same con
nection, it is recommended that the smaller
arsenals be sold, and a largo arsenal bo built
from the proceeds of tbeso sales.
The Secretary concludes by "recommending
that legislation suouiu oe renewed, giving tne
Secretarv of War authority to appoint a com
petent person to arrange and prepare for
publication official documents relating to the
operations ot the army during war.
GEN. SHEEMAU'S B1POBT.
Gen. Sherman, in his report to the Secre
tary of War, Bays the number of enlisted men
in the army is iS5 less than the 30,000 limited
bv law. In active regiments the number of
men tick and on necessary details about
posts will fully equal 25 per cent., so that the
actual strength for military service does not
exceed 19,652 man. In order that the regular
army should fulfill its arduous duties ou the
frontier, as also to form a model on which to
shape the volunteer and militia force of the
United States, I earnestly recommend that
Contiress be asked to hx the limit or tbe en
listed force at such a figure as will give 30,000
for regiments of the hne, and to provide spe
cificallv for non-combatent detachments, such
as Engineer battalion. Ordnance Departs
ment. West Point detachment, Signal Depart
ment. Ordnance and Commissary Sergeants,
in the same manner as has been done for Hospi
tal Stewards.
The artillery regiments of the United States
army have an organization different from the
infaiitry, viz. : 12 batteries to a regiment. Of
these, only one :s equipped and instructed as
a batterv of artillerv. the other eleven compa
nies of each regiment being aimed with mus
kets, and mslructed as inrantry.

Tho military divisions embrace the whole
area of the United States, and their reports
forwarded to the Secretary cf War include the

Steamboat—Inspection.
The leport of tho Supervising Inspectoor
General of the Steamboat-Inspection Service,
for the year ending June 30, 1873, coutains the
following Ftatcments:
" The ear 1872 proved a disastrous ono to
life and property on water. Onehundred and
ninety-two casualties were reported as having
occurred to ttqim vessels, I y which 306 lives
are known to have been lost, aud, as nearly art
could be ascertained, resulting in the loss of
propertv to the amount of $4,008,113. Prop
erty amounting to $2,023,528, and 198 lives,
were lost through casua'ties by fire alone,
showing the urgent necessity of still greater
precautions being taken to guard against that
destructive element on steam vessels.
" Notwithstanding tho steam marine of the
country has suffered severely by reason of
casualties I am pleased to btate thit a con
stant iucreaso in the tonnage thereof has con
tinued. Seviuty-two new steamers, with an
aggregate tonnage of ll.OGfi, were added to
he several inspection districts during tbe
ye.ir 1872.
"Among these were the iron steamers of
tho new American Steamship Lino, of Phila
delphia. These steamers srem to have given
an impetus to commerce which, it is hoped,
.may result in the establishment of other
lines, aDd in the building of an increased
number of steamships in this country which
shall traverse the seas under the American
flag, aud thus aid in the restoration of the
prestige of our commerce on tho ocean.
" During the year ending June 30, there
had been inspected by the various local
Boards 3.G53 steam vessels of all classes,
with an aggregate tonnage of 1,018,484. Cer
tificates or licenses were 1ho issued to 3,4-17
masters, 1,125 mates, 3,500 pilots, and 6,426
engineers.
"During the calendar year 1872, 3,444
Bteamers were inspected, with an aggregate
tonnage cf 1,018,484, and licenses isBiied to
2,882 masters, 1,037 mates. 3,845 pilots, and
6,206 engineers;"

stomach on the brain should be carefully

Happily, there is no necessity for any long dis
