FEED FOR CHINOS
If You Don't Feed and "Scrap' Them
Your Eggs Will Be Few.
In feeding his laying hens 3ne Tenn
see farmer is using as a nrish a pat
ent feed composed of 40 pounds meal,
20 pounds meat scraps, 40 pounds
bran. This mixture could be improved
by making it CO corn meal and 20
each of bran and meat scraps.
Inasmuch as one can get the corn
meal and bran at home, which is the
major portion of the ration and since
Tennessee farmers are in a position
to buy moat scraps nearly as chea,j as
feed manufacturers can, poultrymen
may expect to get feed much cheaper
thru houie mixing.
Feed manufacturers, in mixing poul
try or oth r feeds, always use as their
base the chsapest feed in their partic
ular locality, whether it is corn
what, oats barley, or rye.
For many Tennesseans the follow
ing will be about right for a scratch
feed: 60 percent con, 20 percent
each of wheat screenings and oats.
This will give as satisfactory results
as any feed one can buy in the open
market.

SACRIFICE IN AMERICA.
"A few weeks ago 1 received a
letter from the wife of a farmer in
New York State asking advice about
a comtemplated transaction involving
tne sale of her farm and the pur
chase of another. In order that I
might nuderstand the situation, she
described in detail the manner of
farming, the equipment, and the inti
mate operations. She is in the fullest
sense a helpmeet to her husband.
Sho not only performs the household
tasks but lends a hand in the field.
In four years she has rarely had
breakfast later than 6 o'clock, or sup
per earlierr than 8. The hours be
tween are her working day. Among
other striking statements in her let
ter was this : -"
'July 2 I cat an acre and a half
of peas and mv husband pulled then
back, and on July '4 we had an S 1-2
pound boy. Since then I have been
tied to the house mure or less, but by
getting the little neighbor girl to
tend bBby I cut twelve acres of
hay acrosi the road on another farm
while my husband was helping my
father draw in grain. He has to drive
4 1-2 miles when he changes work
with him.'
"I dare not say which of these two
women is the greater heroine the one
suffering denial, bearing children, en
during grief, toiling in field or factory
and home, but sustained by the inspi
ration of immediate contact with the
greatest tragedy in human history ;
the other far removed trom the sound
or sights of military spectacle, like
wise suffering denial, bearing child
ren, but sustained by the unspoken
and unutterable instinct for sacrifice
and creation which is the unfailing
quality of her sex.
"Compared with this the heroism
of the battlefield, whatever wounds it
may bring, even unto death, is but a
thrilling adventure, and other war
work, there and everywhere, is mere:
playing at service.
TWO OF MILLIONS.
"These women are the types of
millions of women in France and in
An erica, and when I contemplate
their service, their sweetness, and
their uncomplaining sacrifice I feel for
all others and myself the the deep
sompassion of utter unwortbiness.

Mrs. Kate Hamby received a tele

Such delays are past understanding.
More than two months ago the boy
was wounded and when the telegram
arrives it conveys very little informa

severity of the wound.
One feature of the case '
