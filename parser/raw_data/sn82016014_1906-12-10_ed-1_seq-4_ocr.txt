The State Journal Is a member of the
Associated Press and receives the full day
telegraph report ot that treat ri or
ranlnation for the exclusive afternoon
publication In Topeka.
The news is received tn The Stnts .Tonr
nal buildirs over wires for this aoie pur
roee. If Japan does conclude to box our
cars It will be rather difficult for her
to float war bonds in Russia.
Up to date that Intention to haze
Senator La Follette appears to have
been delayed in transmission.
Somebody has counted the words In
the president's message and has dis
covered there are 35.000 of them.
The Shah of Persia Is dead or dying.
There are going to be a lot of widows
over In Persia one of these days.
Count Boni Is writing; for a Paris
newspaper. Why did the Hearst papers
overlook an opportunity of this kind?
It is suggested in London that the
names of the days of the week be
changed. All right. Which one shall
we name after Roosevelt?
The harassing of Roosevelt by "the
interests" has already commenced, but
"the interests" are a little leery about
beginning the hazing of LaFollette.
Three officials who had a hand in
wrecking the Milwaukee Avenue bank
In Chicago have been sent to prison.
Chicago does some things right, any
way. The Japanese say they like the pres
ident's message, but have they really
read It? Just think how the entire
message would look printed in Japa
nese. Incidentally it is doubtful if any mes
sage ever written by any president ever
provoked so much discussion as the one
that Theodore Roosevelt has Just pro
mulgated. The Louisville Courier-Journal says
the latest airship is "190 feet long and
resembles a Kansas ear of corn." Some
thing like a Kansas "nubbin," suggests
Fred Trigg.
Congress has been in session a week
and the chief business the United
States senate has transacted thus far
has been to direct two slaps In the
president's direction.
Speaking of the banquet which To
peka held to celebrate her birthday,
Leavenworth intimates that it was an
"orgy," but leaves it to Wichita to
make the direct charge.
If Mr. Ledbetter, who poses as a con
stitutional lawyer in the Oklahoma
Constitutional convention, thinks the
United States constitution is not the
supreme law of the land, Mr. Ledbetter
learn a few things.
The Leavenworth Times concedes
that it costs more to live these days
than formerly, but it says it is worth
the price. And that, too, in face of the
prospect that the saloons may be closed
In Leavenworth.
Another reason why Mr. Roosevelt
did not include his remarks concerning
the canal in his message last week is
because he considers it a very im
portant subject and worthy of a whole
chapter by itself.
Judge Peters of Newton, positively
refuses to vote for the confirmation of
James Rudolph Garfield as secretary of
the interior. And Judge Peters was
not In the Kansas state senate when it
demanded that the president fire Mr.
Garfield.
Hereafter if you do not wish to be
asked to contribute to a campaign, just
incorporate yourself. Mr. Roosevelt
proposes to make it unlawful for a
corporation to contribute, but while
you remain a private Individual you
can dig up all the campaign money you
want to.
Since too much prosperity has caused
the car famine, the Parsons Sun sug
gests that Mr. Bryan's prophecy of the
coming of "woe, want and misery" has
been fulfilled. It sure has. The grain
shipper is filled with woe, the cattle
man wants some cars, and there is
misery because of a lack of coal.
There are some murmurlngs among
the grandstanders against increasing
the salaries of the supreme court Jus
tices, but it is not of a nature that
ought to have any influence. Among
the others who ought to have a square
deal this winter are those who work
for the state at a financial sacrifice.
The new football rules do not
amount to much, in the opinion of T.
A. Cordry, because only two men less
were killed this season than last. Still,
If Mr. Cordry were one of the two men
whose lives were saved by the new
rules he might think the new rules
amount to considerable. It all depends
on the point of view.
The Newton Kansan strenuously ob
lects to the appointment of Attorney
General Moody on the United States
supreme bench because Massachusetts
already has a supreme judge. But Is
there really any law prohibiting: one
state from having; two Judges? The
people of this country are more inter
ested in whether Mr. Moody will make
a good judge than they are in what
state he comes from.
THE JOINT IX TOPEKA.
The good people of this city heard a
few plain truths yesterday. Repre
sentatives of the State Temperance un
ion say that the violation of law in To
peka is a greater obstacle to its en
forcement in other parts of the state
than are similar or worse condition"
elsewhere, because Topeka is the capital
of the state, the official home of the
state's executive officers.
Topeka people do not deny that the
law is violated here; but because we
do not license such violation we have
fancied that Topeka is better than such
wicked places as Leavenworth and
Wichita. Topeka, as a municipality
refuses to participate in the evil profits
of vice, and will not countenance the
trampling under foot of the law and the
constitution on every street corner.
Yet this very virtue seems to be our
weakness. Periodically, when the law
breaker becomes too bold, we rise and
drive him forth -for a time. Then" he
opens "clubs" and illicit resorts in hid
den placesupstairs rooms behind
bolts and guards. The good citizen of
Topeka hears rumors of these things.
but because he does not see them and
does not hunt them out, he fancies
they do not amount to much.
Ex-Senator Codding, attorney for
the State Temperance Union, says these
"clubs" and dives are worse than the
open saloons of Leavenworth and
Wichita!
In the latter places, says Senator
Codding, gambling rooms and houses
of ill repute are separate from the
saloons, but in these Topeka joints I
gamblers, courtesans and libertines
mingle freely with young boys who are
drawn into the joints.
The citizen of Junction City, or
Leavenworth, or Atchison, who is ac
customed to drinking in a well-appointed
saloon, comes to Topeka- He
wants 'a drink, of course, and instead
of finding it in an open saloon he finds
his way into one of these joints. Then
he. goes home and reports that condi
tions in ToDeka, the capital of the
state, are wore than In his own town.
This condition certainly ought not
to bo, and Topeka owes it to herself to
see that it exists no longer. The
criminal who operates such a place as
the one described is just as bad as the
tbief who sneaks into a house and
steals the silverware. In fact, the re
sult of his crime is worse than that of
the thief, for he ruins homes and
steals manhood, while the thief steals
only a few paltry trinkets.
The joint has been driven out of
other Kansas cities: what does Topeka
propose to do about it?
THE PRESIDENT AT PAXAMA.
It is interesting to note how Presi
dent Roosevelt inspected conditions at
Panama, as related by recent weekly
magazines. There was nothing formal
about his investigations. He plunged
about, here and there, asking questions
and finding out thing3 for himself.
Here are some of the incidents of his
inspection, as told in the current num
ber of Harper's Weekly:
Instead of going up to the new rail
road station where prancing horses
were held ready to draw him to the
new and luxurious Hotel Tivoli for
luncheon, the president led the way to
the government mess-hall at La Boca.
Forty engineers, steam-shovel men and
mechanics had just finished their
breakfast, as the midday meal is call
ed in Spanish-American countries, and
although they knew in a moment who
their visitor was, they did not stare at
him overmuch, but in silence politely
filed out of the room.
Mr. Walsh, manager of the mess, ta
ken by surprise, was anxious to have
a fresh cloth laid.
"Not at all," said Mr. Roosevelt.
"Let's get the crumbs off and go
ahead."
Side-stepping the "Panama Cocktail."
While the waiter was making ready
Mr. Stevens handed to the president
the bottle of quinine and brandy local
ly known as "Panama cocktail," and
invited him to try some. It is a cus
tom held In high repute on the is
thmus to take this mixture before
meals; but Mr. Roosevelt shook his
head and smiled and took a three
grain quinine pill instead.
The breakfast came on briskly. There
were excellent vermicelli soup, good
bread and butter, broiled ham, canned
peas, canned kidney-beans, fried sweet
potatoes, boiled parsnips, jelly cake, ice
cream, coffee, and cocoa.
"Good as any one could wish." was
Mr. Roosevelt's judgment after he had
taken liberally from every dish. He
went through the kitchen and found It
clean and wonder of wonders in the
tropics! without a single fly in sight.
Every door and window was screened
with fine wire mesh that keeps out all
lnpects, no matter how small. All waste
stuff is burned or dumped far out at
sea. Every house and every bit of
ground at La Boca Is as clean as the
houses and the grounds along River
side Drive. Not one drop of water is
allowed to lie stagnant anywhere.
Within an hour after the heaviest rain
fall j ou will not find, either at La Boca
or any other rart of the canal zone, a
puddle as big as a mule's hoof-print.
Incidentally it may be remarked that
not one mosquito as visible anywhere
In the zone.
At Rio Grande the president sprint
ed off through the rain and mud to
see the quarters of the Jamaica negro
laborers. He walks with quick, short,
jerky steps as if he intended only to
spurt for a few rods. But he kept up
the pace indefinitely, and all of us
who went with him were soon puffing.
The laborers' houses are of wood,
perched high on stone piers that keep
them safely dry above the mud of the
rainy season. The doors and windows
are screened and mosqulto-proof, even
though Colonel Gorgas has extermi
nated all the mosquitoes. The canvas
cots and the rooms were clean and
neat. Next we visited a cooking-shed
near at hand. There were Just four
posts holding up a roof, and sitting on
the red earth floor, now a squashy
quagmire, were a few bricks on which
were perched little charcoal-stoves.
"Mr. Letta," said the president,
"please take this down: cook-shed,
iron roof, good; floor, a swamp."
"We are going to have a concrete
floor." explained Jackson Smith, su
perintendent of labor and quarters.
"When? Why not now?" the presi
dont shot at him. Mr. Smith said no
more, but seemed wrapped in deep
thought.
At the Hotel Tivoli that night the
president heard complaints from com
mittees of the mechanics, trainmen.
and clerks. Most of these related to."
the distribution and prices of food.
Every one was enthusiastic about
health conditions alon the canal.
There has not been one death from
disease among the 12,000 white canal
folk in the last three months.
As one result of the complaints Mr.
Roosevelt stopped the train next
morning at New Empire, and went
straight to the quarters of the bach
elor clerks, where he found the sani
tary equipment in shocking condition.
Three messengers were sent flying for
the local sanitary inspector, and that
man may thank his lucky stars that
the runners could not find him.
"I ask you, sir," the president said
to Colonel Gorgas, "to have this con
dition abated, at once, and to send me
forthwith at Washington a report de
tailing exactly what has been done and
exactly the condition in which these
quarters are stablished."
It's a pretty safe guess that the
president knows ai about conditions at
Panama.
JOURNAL ENTRIES
Leavenworth is wearing its lid, but
it is wearing; it tilted over one ear.
You know what that indicates.
Now that the president has simpli
fied spelling, if he will also simplify
arithmetic he will confer a great favor
on the women who keep household
accounts.
While the message was highlv inter
esting, of course, this department Is
not holding its breath while waiting
for the next installment, which will
tell the story of the canal.
A man has been indicted for bribery
in Pittsburg. The rest of the country
will be surprised to learn that Pitts
burg considers bribery a crime.
JAYHAWKER JOTS
Prosperity has struck the Chase
Register to the extent of a new press.
A Muscotah farmer got 212 gallons
of cider out of a single wagon load of
apples. How's that for juiciness?
A Highland woman made $15 in one
month from one cow. Besides supply
ing a family of seven, she sold milk to
15 customers.
It takes considerable to dampen the
enthusiasm of the baseball crank. Out
at Pawnee Reck a ball game was re
cently played in a snow storm.
There is a widespread demand, says
Morton Albaugh, for another edition
of XX- Y. Morgan's book of travels.
And, adds Mr. Albaugh, every candi
date for United States senator will be
supposed to buy one.
Deacon Walker: We have a brother
in our church who belonged to several
other denominations before he came
to us, and he tells us they have the
s?.me trouble everywhere: Impossible
to get a $2,000 preacher for $750 a
year.
A Hiawatha landlady is certainly a
wonder, if what the World says is cor
rect. She has 17 boarders and each
and every one praises her table. She
does all the cooking by herself
washes the dishes does all the work
hires no help. And she finds time to
attend church regularly and enjoy lec
ture course entertainments and all
other events of worth and interest.
A year as;o a wreck occurred on the
Santa Fe near Lang, Kan., and two
pigs in the express car escaped. Wells
Fargo offered a reward for them and
one was returned. Another was found
lr. the possession of a farmer, who
claimed he had bought it on the
etreets of Emporia for $3.50. Suit was
brought, the express company recov
ered judgment against L. D. Water
man for it, and costs amounted to
about $350. "And it was a red pig at
that," says the Wichita Eagle.
Atchison Globe: Some time ago
Mrs. D. N. Wheeler bought forty pig
eons, intending to raise squabs. Since
buying the birds, not a single egg has
been laid. Investigation by an expert
reveals that every bird is a rooster.
Mrs. Wheeler's friends are greatly
amused, and they are inducing people
all over the east to write to her for
squabs. Among- others, the manager
of the Waldorf-Astoria, in New York,
wrote her, saying he would take all
her squabs, and sending her a stencil
plate with which to mark shipments.
Sabetha Herald: Bret Hanson has
just recovered from a siege with the
postoffice department regarding a
shortage against him which occurred
during the time Hanson was postmas
ter at Price. When the postoffice at
Price was discontinued last August
Hanson closed up his affairs and sent
in his report. Afterward the postoffice
department made a discovery that
Hanson was short one cent in his ac
counts. Then the ponderous wheels of
governmental machinery began to re
volve. Slowly but surely the great
cogs moved and made work for clerks.
Th, clerks must have found that
shortage a serious problem, for it took
them three months to get it in such
shape that they could make a demand
on Hanson for the penny. Last week
the demand came in the form of a
draft on Hanson for one cent.

REFLECTIOXS OF A BACHELOR.
From the New Tork Press.l
It's awful unlucky to kiss a girl on
the sly when her father is looking.
It gives a man standing to have a

it.
When a man's daughter is engaged he
can't go into the parlor even to hunt for

It's mighty inconsistent for men to

KANSAS COMMENT
FORGIVING -STCIBBS.
It is announced that Walter Roscoe
Stubbs will introduce an anti-pass
two-cent-fare bill at the coming ses
slon of the legislature. It will be re
membered that it was very largely
through the influence of Speaker
htubbs that the bill was sidetracked
last session, but this will be forgiven
If he gets through the kind of a bill
the people want and need. The peo
ple want legislation that will keep the
railroads entirely out of politics. They
can then hope to do something to
wards equalizing rates and not until
then. Tho people do not complain be
cause the railroads make money, but
of the unfair way in, which they dis
criminate against the small shippers
in favor of the larger ones, thereby
eliminating competition. The anti
pass measure is the first step to be
taken, and the measure should be suf
flciently stringent and easy of enforce
ment that It will serve the purpose ex
pected of it, and not be a dead letter
on the statutes, as are most laws in

The railroad idea of law seems to be
that if it is for the railroad it should be
enforced, and if against it should be ig-

MENTAL RESERVATION.
The Wichita Eagle calls attention to
the fact that when Ben Tillman took
an oath as a Lnlted States senator to
support the constitution, he probably
made a mental reservation as to the
fifteenth amendment. Probably the
same as Mayor Ross Findley, of Wich
ita, made a mental reservation of the
prohibition amendment when he took
an oath an mayor at W ichita to support
the constitution of the state of Kan

BROKEN TIME-TABLES.
The tragic death of Samuel Spencer,
president of the Southern railway, in
the wreck of Thursday morning, should
serve as a terrible warning to the of
ficials of his and other Southern rail
roads. That the country has lost one
of its sanest and most hard-working
railway executives everyone will con
cede. Mr. Spencer rose from the ranks
because of his industry and his ability
to think clearly on railway questions.
He was able, moreover, to look far
into the future, and was one of the
first to recognize the south's industrial
possibilities. Yet the comparative
suddenness with which its prosperity
came really swamped his railroad, as
it has many others. Not even his prac
tical experience could insure a well
run railroad. Whether this was be
cause of his own limitations, or be
cause he was more absorbed in ques
tions of policy and finance, this is not
the time to consider. The tragic fact
remains that his own lamentable
death was caused by one of those need
iest and Inexcusable accidents about
which the southern sress has of late
been complaining with deep feeling.
Moie than that, the constant delays
on the southern railroads have be
come so grave a menace to t- j orderly
conduct of business, and therefore the
pros-perity of the south, that in Georgia
a svErtematic campaign of criticism has
been carried on for months past, with
tho management of Mr. Spencer's rail
way particularly under fire. It Is sig
nificant to observe, therefore, that Mr.
Spencer's death would not have oc
curred if both the trains wrecked had
not been hours behind their schedule.
As now explained, the fault lay with
tha operator of a block signal station,
but that not much reliance was placer!
upon the block operators appears from
the fact that a brakeman was hastily
sent back to flag the oncoming train.
Moreover, if a railway persistently
breaks its own rules, if its schedules
are in a state of chronic demoraliza
tion, its own employes are little to be
blamed if they become lax in their
own duties. New York Evening Post.
EXEMPLAR OF CIVIC HONOR.
Tax dodging New York, which in
cludes the wealthy part of it pretty
comprehensively, will be greatly
shocked and disgusted over the action
of ex-Mayor Seth Low. in paying over
to the city treasury $27,397 in back
taxes. The act Is entirely voluntary on
Dr. Low's part, and that is what will
make It so inexplicable to the high
financiers and others who even go so
far as to maintain more or less unreal
residences out of the city in order to
dodge tax claims. The wealthy ex
mayor finds that he had been deduct
ing a certain mortgage on property be
longing to him which he has since
learned could not legally be deducted.
It is a fine exhibition of civic spirit
which he shows, and is made where it
la most needed. Springfield Republi
can. BELATED PRECAUTION.
Further testimony concerning the
land operations out west suggests that
if there is any public land left it
should be locked up during the night

J. XV. Foley in New York Times.
A Woman Who Heads Expeditions.
In her account of her mountain-climbing
in the Andes Miss AnnfcvPeck nar
rates some dramatic incidents and nar
row escapes in climbing Mount Huas
caran: "Our progress was slow as the way
was steeper and more difficult. Sud
denly, in crossing a gully, our leader
slipped and slid rapidly down as far as
the rope allowed, dropping his ice-axe
by the way instead of uBlng it to stop
himself; bo it depended solely on me.
Luckily I now had on climbing-irons
and was holding the rope tight. When
tne pun came, much to my delight, it
was not so strong as I expected, and I
had no difficulty in retaining my posi
tion and stopping his downward career.
K. readily regained his feet and his Ice
axe, and we continued on our way.
Again X. refused to proceed with the
rope or to carry the camera. I called
him a coward, and all I could in Span
ish, to no avail. 'He did not propose to
be killed, if we were: he would hold the
rope in his hand.' Yes, and drop it if we
both slipped. No indeed, said I. It was
all or none. I took the camera, coiled
up the extra rope, and went on with
E. alone. Presently I perceived X. fol
lowing. He overtook us, half apologized
for his conduct, said he would take the
camera and put on the rope, but what
would I give him? I considered the
twenty soles promised far more than he
deserved, but at length agreed to give
thirty if we reached the big rock. It
semed near, but with the necessary
windings and our delays, at half past
one it might take another hour to ar
rive. Fearing that the Indians would
depart, leaving the tents, etc., on the
snow, if we did not return by three, I re
luctantly gave the word to halt.
Making tlio Ohio Xavlgable.
The Ohio river will be made navi
gable even if it takes 68 dams and
locks to do it, said the U. S. govern
ment. - That was about, a generation
ago, and much higgling by the differ
ent sections of the country affected by
the suggested improvements has re
sulted in seriously hampering the pur
pose of congress, according to J. R.
Schmidt, who tells about "Making the
Ohio Navigable" in the Technical
World Magazine for December. But
the appropriation by congress of over
a million dollars for the construction
of one dam alone, the Fernbank dam
near Cincinnati, finally gave definite
shape to the work of making the river
navigable for 1,500 miles. The work
on this dam is about half-done, and
five other dams are partially complet
ed. The importance and national
character of this work may be bet
ter understood when it is known that
Pittsburg coal shipped down the Ohio
last year was destined for Japan, to
be used by tho Mikado's fleet in its
fight against Russia. The Ohio is the
natural highway of commerce from
the east to the middle west, but has
heretofore been navigable for only four
months in the year. When the Fern
bank dam is completed, the river will
bo navigable as far down as Cincin
nati all the year round. With the im
proved river it is estimated that the
cost of transportation will be reduced
about one-half.
When Nesbit Read Hia Poem.
Wilbur Nesbit, whose first novel, "The
Gentleman Ragman," has just been pub
lished, once read a poem ar a public din
ner at the University of Chicago. It
was the first time he had tried to read
in public, and it is probable that he
will never forget the occasion. The late
President Harper was present, and with
others of the faculty stTt at the speaker's
table. Dr. Harper, who was beside Nes
bit, observed that the young man was
extremely nervous over his little part in
the programme. So he spoke reassur
ingly to him; told him to keep his nerve
and do his best; that tle crowd was
iriendly to him and that everybody

Nevertheless, in spite of all this, when
Nesbit arose, he had one of the choicest
examples of stage fright ever seen. His
throat was so dry that he could barely
speak for the moment. ITis lips twitched
nervously and his hands quivered. He
was not taking any chances with his
memory, but was reading from manu
script. This only added to his confuBion,
for the paper crackled and rattled and
wiggled and wobbled. He stuck to it,
however, and at last, after finishing, he
sank into his chair and took long
breaths, sipping from time to time at his
glass of water.
"Well, how did I do?" he asked Dr.
Harper 'when he had recovered enough
to speak.
"First rate," was the genial reply.
"You did splendidly, but why did you
read each line of your poem twice?"

THE EVENING STORY J
Her First Christmas.
(By Amelia Summers.)
"I wisht I was dead honest, I do!"
sighed the girl in the rumpled china
silk waist. "To think we've got to
work nights for two whole weeks. I
bet I go to the Empire store next year,
They close every night at 6, Christmas
or not Christmas."
Emily Green, to whom these re
marks were addressed, did not answer.
Obedience, at first irksome, then ha
bitual, had been her lot ever since she
cou'.d remember. She had gone to the
half-orphan asylum at 6. At 9 she
was a full orphan.
The orphanage had given her a good
common-school education and at 17
sho had taken a position as inspector
with the Burnham company, shivering
with all the lack of confidence pecul
iar to the institutionally reared girl.
The greatest marvel of all was to have
real money to handle and for a time
she swayed between a desire to do
madly extravagant things and to hoard
her small salary like a miser. Finally,
she settled down to a quiet life at a
home for working girls, where she
still had some of the institutional at
mosphere to support her inexperience.
At the end of the second year she
was promoted to the floor. Here
among veilings and laces and boas and
neck ruffs she developed into a very
fair saleswoman. Her stock was al
ways in good order, and she was the
sort of sirl who never incurred the
floorwalker's praise or displeasure, be
cause she was neither very brilliant
nor unsatisfactory. Customers, how
ever, liked her and she was proud oi
her personal following that waited for
her no matter how busy she was.
In fact she had been quite satisfied
with the even tenor of her way until
tho Christmas trade began. Then
came a period of feverish unrest. She
caught the enthusiasm of her Christ
mas customers yet realized that it
was futile. Barring a few girls and
he matron at the home, she could give
presents to no one, and even with
these there was the barrenness of mere
acquaintance, instead of the warmth
of family ties. Somewhere over in
Bngland were her mother s people, but
they had not cared to follow her sad
history. Her father, a violinist who
generally had found employment in
second-class theaters, had handed
down to her no family tree. And yet
Emily Green could smile on a custo
mer when her fellow workers wished
they were dead, and she could face un
complainingly the ordeal of night
work because It was much better than
sitting in her hall bedroom and wish
ing she had some one to make gifts
for.
She sighed as she put the lid on the
veil box. The young- girl who was
carrying away her purchase, a lovely
brown lace veil, had bought it for her
older sister.
'Kate looks so pretty in brown,"
she had confided to the interested
salesgirl.
Katie!" O for a Katie or a Sally
or a sister of any ' name for her very
own!
The store had only Just opened its
doors, the shopping; throng had not
yet arrived and only other clerks were
making purchases during the hour al
lowed for this purpose by the firm.
I d like to see something in a lace
boa," said a masculine voice, and Em
ily swung around. The girl in the
rumpled waist was telling the wrapper
in the tiny booth overhead what she
thought of a firm that did not close
up till 10 o'clock.
"A lace boa?" echoed Emily. "I'm
afraid we have nothing of that sort.
How would you like dotted net?"
The young; man uttered a sigh of
relief.
"I don't know what you call it. 1
thought it was lace. It looks soft and
fluffy like
He had no hat, and plainly was an
employe from another department.
Emily turned around the nickel-plated
rack with its swaying neck ruffles.
"Any particular color?" she in
quired. "It's for my mother. I suppose
ladies her age mostly wear black, but
I hate it always looks like a funeral.
How do you think light blue or pink
would do?"
"What is her best dress or coat?"
inquired Emily, with evident interest.
"Why. I'm sure I don't know. May
be I had better get white."
For the first time in her life Emily
Green took the initiative.
"I tell you what to do. Don't buy
it today, but tonight find out what hei
coat is like, and then tomorrow we'll
find something that will match it."
"Fine! My name's Henry Stanton.
I'll be here at 8:15 tomorrow morning
Whom shall I ask for if you're not
here."
"My name is Emily Green but I'll
be here."
"Oh, I thought you might be off do
ing some Christmas shopping, too."
Emily swuns back the ruffs with a
sigh. Everybody but herself had Christ
mas shopping to do.
"Her coat's black broadcloth with
velvet trimmings and some white braid
mixed in. She never even smiled
when I asked her, so I don't believe
she suspects," said the guileless Henry
to Emily the next morning. Together
they picked out a black and white net
boa that Emily assured him was in
excellent taste. And it was. The girl
had excellent judgment in dress. The
sale was quickly completed, but the
next morning Henry came back. He
had such a list of Christmas presents.
Would she help him finish his shop
ping? His young brother wanted some
kid gloves, and his Cousin Helen, who
was an artist, would be pleased with a
jar for her brushes. Before they fin
ished their shopping at the warning
clang of the nine o'clock bell, Emily
felt that she knew the entire Stanton
family and all its ramifications. More
over, she knew that Henry was private
secretary to the head of the firm, and
in line for promotion.
Somehow she was not at all sur
prised when she left the store at 10:30
that night to find Henry waiting for
her. He said that it was no time of
night for a girl to go home alone.
Emily, who had gone through life so
utterly alone, felt a delightful trem
bling at his protective tone. After
that, he waited for her every night.
On the third nis;ht before Christmas,
Henrv stood outside the door watching
the stream of lagging, weary girls
drag Its way to the street. Emily was
almost the last to appear, but her
feet did not lag; and her face was
radiant. Also her arms were filled with
bundles.
"Oh, Mr. Stanton, did you know
did your mother tell you? She's in
vited: me to spend Christmas eve and
day at your house. Isn't it simply too
lovely to believe? I've never had a
real Christmas. At the orphanage we
got things from rich people who did
not know our names, even, and the tree
was beautiful but your mother says
I may hang my stocking beside hers,
and help her trim the tree for your
brothers. Do you think little Jimmy
would like one of those grizzly bears?
I got him one with such saucy ears."
Henrv Stanton stopped short and
took the parcels from her arms.
"Do you mean you've been "
"Oh, I never had such a glorious
time," the girl said, with a laugh thai
held Just a suggestion of a sob. "I had
some money saved up, and no one to
spend it on until your mother invited
me. Isn't she a dear? And that boa
will look Just lovely with her black
coat. She had the coat on today."
The parcels no longer weighed heav
ily In Stanton's arms. Through Love's
glasses he read the girl's motives and
the secret of her newfound? happiness.
Christmas was a personal feast with
her at last.
An hour later Emily sat up sudden
ly in bed. A terrible thought had
come to her. Why had Mrs. Stan
ton asked her to spend Christmas at
their cheerful home? Because she was
sorry for the lonely girl? Yes, that
must be it! Oh, would the day ever
come when folks would like her for
herself, and not because they pitied
her? She flung herself back on her
pillow. She'd make that gray-haired
little woman like her. When she left
the Stanton house she would carry
away the respect of its mistress. Then
she recalled Henry's kind words at
their parting. "It isn't mother alone,
you know we all want you."
Wasn't that Christmas enough, af
ter all, to be wanted?
Threo blocks away. In the Stanton
dining-room, Mrs. Stanton laid down
the popcorn she was stringing and
hunted her handkerchief. Henry had
Just been telling her the story of Em
ily's abrupt and Joyous Christmas
shopping. The mother who had raised
her four fatherless sons so admirably
leaned across the table and stroked
her eldest boy's hand.
"I knew she was all right, Henry,
as soon as I had talked with her. Or
phan asylum or no asylum, somewhero
in her blood there's a good strain. And
her happiness over my invitation was
something wonderful to see. Sho
clasped both my hands in hers, and 1
really thought she would kiss them,
too."
"Do you think she understands
that "
"No, dear, I do not think she could
grasp so much happiness all at once.
She is so accustomed to being pitied
that she thinks this is your feeling now
but she will be worth winning-,
Henry. I am satisfied."
Dear little mother," he said, hold
ing her hands tight. "I knew you'd
love her. I did the moment sho
raised her eyes to mine. We will make
her very hapiy, won't we, mother
dear?" (Copyright, 1906, by M. M.
Cunningham.) :,
