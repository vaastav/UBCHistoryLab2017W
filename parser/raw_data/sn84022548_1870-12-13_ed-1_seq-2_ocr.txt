The President's Message.
The president's message, the more iui
m portant parts of which wc publish this
week, will fce read with that interest (hie
a document coming from so h.rli n source
and touching as it des ujxm many tpics
f absorbing interest 'to the people. The
previous utterances of (Jen. ('rant, writ
ten or spoken, have always lieen marked
by directness, clearness and force. Thi
message is no exception to the rule, but
rather a magnifying of thoe qualities as
excellent as they are rare. No one ari
sing from its perusal will 1 mystified by
obscure sentences, or studied attempts at
the concealment of ideas. So far as we
hear any expression of opiniou of itsmer
it., it is one of high commendation, un
less we except the sensational Sun, which
at no time of day sheds its friendly rays
upon its author, and decent treatment
from that .juarter was hardly to be ex
pected. For one we do not endorse the
message in its entirety, though we con
fess the president in every ease gives a p.
yarcntly good reasons fur the faith that is
in him. The quality of the arguments,
of course, will dccnd upon the stand
point from whence one views them. One
may build an imping structure upon a
slippery foundation, but that being un
tenable the edifice is worthier, like "the
house that was huilded upon the sand."

cAmiiiie: uie president it earnest
that congress should take measures f.,r
the immediate purchase of the Island of
San Domingo and pass resolutions of an
nexation : pleading with great wan.-.th.
To one who thinks exactly as he docs hi.
reasons must appear to le conclusive and
convincing. We believe in his arguments,
but have small faith in his theory of an
nexation. We are opposed on principle to
all schemes of territorial aggrandizement
beyond the solid confines of din- own con
tinent; no further north than the Pole,
and no further south than the isthmus of
Darien. Kvcn in this confined area we
have a sufficiently diversiiied soil, climate,
1-eople and natural productions to call
forth our every talent, without exploring
the ocean for other acquisitions. e ,m,
cont.Mit with our present empire: or at
least shall re 'ommend our countrymen to
oc satisfied until we are iu a better con
dition to pay for more. Let Us plow, till,
cultivate and subdue all the soil in North
America, before we search for the gems
of the tropics and invite them to our sis
terhood of nationalities. The opportuni
ty to co.uet with them will not 1 want
ing then,' we imagine. Annex San Do
mingo, and what then? Hay ti. Cuba,
Jamaica and the Bahamas may seek the
protection of our flag; or we mav seek
them, as we now do San Domingo. With
all these in our I'nion. other islands may
be found necessary to our national pros
perity, or to Miggest the bug'ooar of a fu
ture foreign war. We condemn the pol-I'-y.
Surely we have land enough iu our
broad west to tax our energies to culti
vate, to explore, and through which to
weave a net-work of railroads, for one
century at least, without entering upon
the hazardous job of att:ic-iiir r our
selves a colony of greasy Spaniards and
dirty half breeds. 1 the soil they inhabit
ever so bountiful or the air thev breathe
laden with the perfume of vast gardens

hold good in the affairs of nations as well
as of individuals. Would it not lie wise
to develop our mines, civilize, christian
izo, educate and weld together our many
incongruous social and political elements.
before attempting that feat iu the island
of San Domingo? "One- should ! just
oeloro being generous. We fear the
president is a little 1'topian. and that hi
"glittering generalities" will not con
dense to solid facts. As all is not gold
that glitters," we are constrained to op
pose his San Dojningo singulation. We
have enough territory now; nay. too
much.
With reference to our claims airaiiist
Kngland in the Alabama matter, the pre
sidetit is tame, offensively so, when the
justice of these claims is considered. He
only "regrets to say that, no conclusion
has been reached," when he should have
said he was "ashamed to say lw, conclu
sion hail been reached." He adds, -the
cabinet of lndou does not appear to lie
willing to concede that her majesty's gov
ernment was guilty of negligence, or did
,it i...n.,,..i - i i .
-I i'v.1 lumen uuy act miring the war. i v
.v. t-i .... i
nnn.li me i uupj .states iiasajust . ..a.-e
of complaint." This virtually is a refu
sal to pay ; nothing less than that. Now
if we have just claims against Kngland
for her perfidious course towards us du
ring the war. it is time they were put in
train of payment, and if we have no
claims it is time our pretensions were
withdrawn. We want no' money that is
not honestly ours. We should surrender
none that is ours. It has been nearly six
years since the closo of the war. During
all this time these claims have been in
chancery, still they verge no nearer set
tlement than when the case was first call-
I If. s.. . . .

acknowledge their justice, make it at

Knowledge them, and pay them, too, or
ourselves own that we were wron and
cat a piece of that same large humble
pic we so greedily devoured when offered
us by that power in the demand for the
surrender of Mason and Slidell under the
lying pretext of yielding to theneeessi
ties of international law. Three' foreign
ministers Adams, Johm.on and Motlev
have severally had the handling of
these claims ; neither of whom have ad
vanced farther than to be punctiliously
dined, wined, feted and toasted, all the
proceeding leing si,iccfl with the hollow
refrain of that " friendly feeling now and
for a long period existing between the
two nations of the same blood and shak
ing the same language," and of "a set
tlement consistent with the honor and
dignity of the two nation," which our
president has heard so many times that
the language, has become lto a part of his
hciug as to be incorporated into this his
cond annual message, apparently with
the idea that the language wa original
with himself. We do not advocate a war
f-r the collection of these claims. War
i the first resort of fools and the last nr..
Iea! of wise men. , But we would adjust
them peacefully if we could, forcibly if
c, must," or back down. We would
have a jolicy there was no mistaking.
The Canadian fisheries question nnd the
free navigation of the St. Lawrence claims
a fair share cf the president's attention,
who says an unfriendly feeling is harbor
ed by the Canadian outhorities, which is
exhibited by them in jietty acts of hos
tility ; he asks congress to authorize him

Mark Twain's ' Innocent's Abroad.
It is seldom that a book has ajijieared
which so well combiner instruction and
amusement, yet is not silly, aud gives the
reader an ever increasing interest in it

Our readers have all heard of it We
have frequently made mention of and ad
vertised it in our columns; but as no
agent has apjieiired in the vicinity, it is
prohable that but few have seen it. . This
is a book for everybody. The grave and
the gay iu it have a companion when de
prived of those, that can converse with
eye and tongue. The universal commen
dation which this book receives from all
classes of eople, is a sufficient voucher
for all we have said. Than the author
of this book no writer in the country is
more popular? Who has not read his
witty, humorous satin!?, inlaid ns t!,,,.
always are with flashes of sense rarely to
be met with ? Who ha, not admired his
elegant language and rare jiowers of des

from the message which we did not know
before. We had supposed government
gave an unbroken belt of land on each
side of the track, thus giving the various
coqKiratimis a complete monopoly of that
narrow territory (not so very narrow, ei
ther) through which the roads run. This
is not the case. Government reserves
each alternate section, which it sells at
double rates, (2,50) the common price
being cl By this means it develops
our western wilds in a day which without
such action, would lay desolate for years,
losing nothing itself, as the land brings
a higher price nnd a readier sale. This

LAUsdi Kinpnkss. We have long
been aware of the immense laud grants
made by government in aid of western
canal and railroad enterprises. We knew
they were enormous ; but not until we
had read the president's message, did we
have any just conception of their magni
tude. J hat document informs us that
during the past year over 278.000.0(h)
of acres were conveyed for these purpo
ses, and that 174,000,000 more are still
due. Tli is makes an aggregate of over
400,01 Hi.OOO of acres given in further

have Jeen correctly presented to the pub
lic in the Standard already. T need not
repeat them. I wish to sav here that I
did not at the time suppose i was violat

I yet convinced that I have, though a de
cision it seems Has been made, (by what
court or authority I am unable to sav)

the meaning of the law, yet I am well
assured also that in some parts of the
county men have been arrested on the
same charge, and dismissed on the ground
that selling books by subscription, or
other goods by sample as sewing ma
chines, musical instruments or anv kind
of goods where orders were taken and the
goods delivered at another time, is not
peddling, and requires no law. As I am
now under bonds to take my trial, it is
probable that this question will be set-

petty affair. Now though this be a pet
ty affafr and of trivial consequence, I de

THE CAXDUX riSHEKIES. , ; ...
The course pursued by the Canadian
authorities toward the fishermen of the
United States during the past season has
not been marked by a friendly feeling.
By the first article of the convention of
1818, between Great Britian and the
United States, it was agreed that the in
habitants of the United States should
have forever, in common with British
subjects, the right of taking fish in the
waters therein defined. In the waters
not included in the limits named in the
Convention "within three miles of parts

There is reason to believe that this un

it is not known that any seizure of a fish..

as the claim is founded on alleged con

cannot lie acquiesced in by the United

except such as might lie necessary for the
prosecution of their voyages to and from
said fishing grounds, and anv vessel of
the Uuited States which shall contra

Colonial statutes, and not upon the Con
vention, this Government cannot but re
gard it as unfriendly aud in contraven
tion of the spirit if not of the letter of
the treaty, for the faithful execution of
which the Imperial Government is alone
responsible.
Anticipating that an attempt mav pos
sibly be made by the Canadian authori
ties in the coming season to repeat their
unneighhorly acts toward our fishermen,
1 recommend vou to confer nnon tlP :-"v.
ecutive the power to suspend, by procla-
luauou. me operation ot the laws author
izing the transit of troods. wares ami mo
chandise in bond across the territory of
the United States to Canada; and fur
ther, should such an extreme niran 1.
come necessary, to suspend the operation
of any laws whereby the vessel, of the
dominion or tanada are permitted to en

THE NAVIGATION OK THE ST. LAWRENCE.
Mr. Clay advanced his argument in Be
half of our right, the principle for which
he contended has been frequently, and by
various nations, recognized by .law. 'and
treaty,and has been extended to several
other great rivers.
By the treaty concluded at Mayenee in
1831," the Eh ine was declared free from
the point where it is first navigable to
the sea. By the convention between
Spain and .Portugal, concluded , in 1 So 5,
the navigation of the Douro throughout
its whole extent was made frep for flip
subjects of both crowns. In 18o.'l the Ar
gentine coniedoration by treaty then open
ed the free navigation of the Paraguay
and Uruguay to the merchant vessels of
all nations. In ISoC the Crimean war
closed by a treaty which provided for the
free navigation of the Danube. In 1858
Bolivia, by treaty, declared that it regard
ed the rivers Amazon and La Plata', in
accordance with fixed principles of na
tional law, as highways or channels open
ed by nature for the commerce of all na
tions. In 18o!) the Paraguay was made
nee uy treaty, and in December, lu'j,
the Emperor of Brazil, by imperial de
cree, declared the Amazon to be open to
the frontier of Brazil to the merchant
ships of all nations. The greatest living
untish authority on this subject, while
assenting to the abstract right of the
British claims, says ; "It seems difficult
to deny that Great Britain may ground
the refusal upon strict law, but it is equal
ly difficult to deny first, that in so doing
she exercises harshly an extreme and
hard law; secondly, that her conduct
with respect to the navigation of the St
Lawrence is in glaring aud discreditable
inconsistency with her conduct with 're
spect to the navigation of the Mississippi,

THE BEPHEsSIOX OK AMEillCAX C'O.MMKUOK.
Our depressed commerce is a subject to
which I called your special attention at
the last session, and suggested that we
will in the future have to look more to
the countries south of us. and to ' China
and Japan, for its revivd. Our represen
tatives to all these governments have ex
erted their influence" to encourage trade
between the "-"uked States and the coun
tries to which they are accredited, but
the fact exists that the carrvinsr is done
almost entirely in foreign bottoms, and
while thi, state of affairs exists we can
not control our due share of the commerce
of the world. That between the Pacific
Stales and ( hiua ami Japan is about ail
the carrying trade now conducted in
American vessels. I would recommend a
liberal policy toward that line of Ameri
can steamers, Ue that will insure its suc
cess and even increased usefulness. The
co,t of building iron vessels, theonlv ones
that can compete with foreign ships 'in the
carrying trade, is -o mucli greater in the
1 nited State than in foreign countries
that without s-.me assistance from the
ioverm!ieut they cannot 1-e successfully
built here. There will be several propo".
Mtions laid 1-oforo Congress iu the course
of the prevent ses-iou, looking for a rera
ody for this evil, even if it should be at
s..iue cost to the National treasury.
f hope such encouragement will be giv

The refonn in the management of In
dian affairs has received the special at
tention of the Administration from the
inauguration to the present day. The ex
periment of making it a missionary work
was tried with a few agencies given to
the denomination of Friends, and has
been found to work advantageously. All
agencies aud superintendeucies not so

arnvy. The act of Congress reducing the
army renders army officers ineligible for
civil positions. The Indian arpnoips lie

tne agencies to such religious denomina
tions as had heretofore established mis
sionaries among the Indiaits, and per
haps to some other denominations, who
would undertake the work on the same
tenns, as a missionary work.
The societies selected are allowed to
nSme their owu agents, subject to the ap
proval of the executive, and are expected
to watch over them and aid them as mis-'
siouaries to christianize and civilize the
Indian and to train him in th arts of

the official acts of these agents and re
quires of them as strict an aceoimtnhiiitT-
as if they were apjxiiuted in any other

that the policy now rursued will in a

A like unfriendly disnosition loi, I
manifested on the part of Canada, in the
maintenance of a claim to the
exclude the citizens of the Unitedtates
trom the navigation of the St, Lawrence.
This river constitutes a naval .nnflnt t
the ocean for eight States, with an aggre
gate population of about 17,(100.000 in
habitants, and with an aggregate tonnage
of 6". 61 1,307 tons upon the waters which
discharge into it. The foreign commerce
of our ports in these waters is open to
British competition, and the major part
of it is done in British bottoms. If the
American seamen be excluded from tl.;
national avenue to the ocean, the monop
oly of the direct commerce of tho l.ii-
mf s. . v nine
ports with the Atlantic would be in for-
eign nanus, ineir vessels on transatlantic
voyages having an access to our lakp
ports, which would be denied to Araeri
can vessels in similar voyages. To state
such a proposition is to refute. its justice.

TAXES.
The tax collected from the people has
been reduced more than eighty million
dollars per annum. By steadiness in
our present course there is no reason why.
in a few short years, the national tax
gatherer may not disappear from the door
of the citizen almost entirely. With the
revenue stamp dispensed by" Postmasters
in evert- community, a tax" upon liquors
of all sorts, and tobacco in all its fonns,
and, by a wise adjustment of the tariff!
which will put a duty upon those articles
which we could dispense with, known a&
luxnries. and on those which we use more
oi than we produce, revenue enough may
be raised after a few years of peace and
n.iiseijuem reduction ot indebtedness to
luiiui an our obligations. A further re
duetiou of expenses in addition to reduc
tion of interest account may be relied up
on to make this practicable.
