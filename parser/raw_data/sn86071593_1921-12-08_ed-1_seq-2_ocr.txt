QUICK IRK OF
HIS TROUBLES
Montnelicr r Man Finds
Grateful Relief After
Eight Years of Suf
fering "From now on Tan lac is my stand-by
mul I never expected to be without it in
the house." said I. II. Robinson, Tor race
Mroet. Montpelier, Vt. 5
"For eight years I thought- I had kid
ney trouble as my back was weak and I
was almost constantly bothered with
backache. I always felt tired and worn
out and was very nervous too.
"Tanlae made quick work of my
troubles. It whetted up my appetite, put
my stomach in apple-pie order and Rave
me more strength and energy than in
.rears. It completely knocked out my
back-ache and my nerves are .so calm
and steady now that I have no trouble
about sleeping. It made a well man out
of me and I am always going to have a
buttle handy in case anything goes
wrong.
Tanlae is sold in Brattleboro by the

' LOOKING AHEAD.
The glad new year will soon arrive, according to Tfime's plan, and we,
to make onr country thrive, should do the best we can. The nation's lacking
vim and pep, as all wise merchants know; the eagle moves with laggard step,
and doesn't like to crow. Each day some fancy cure is sprung, evolved
from someone's hat; each day some statesman spraiiw a luiig annopwlng this
or that. . Our land, once safest of all bets, has moped a long, long while; if
every man would pay his dt-bts, she'd soon sit up and smil She'd soon sit
up and say, ''Odsfish, that dope has' made me well; my strength's rct.irncd
and now I wisb to go outdnors and yell" By fancy nostrums she is lxreI.
she's tired f.f statesmen's pills; her energy will be restored when we all pay
our bills. The brave new year is drawing near, so let us start it right ; let's
all resolve to start the year without a debt in sight. We'll take a basketful!
of coin and pay up all we owe. the butcher for his tenderloin, the baker fr
his dough; the catskin dealer for his tor." the coal man for his slate; then
normalcy will feel the spur, and bit her old time gait.

THE OLDEST ROYALTY.
The accession of Crown Prince Hiro
bito to the throne of Japan, as regent for
his incapacitated father, the Emperor
Yoshihito brings out the fact that the
Japanese dynasty he represents is the old
est in the world. Ilirohito traces bis
descent directly to the Emperor Jimmu
Tcnno, who came to the throne in the
year ('.00 B. C. Thus the present royal
family of Japan has reigned, if the re
cords are true, for 2,."X1 years.
This is an amazing period for one fam
ily to span. It embraces not only the
whole of modern and medieval times, but
the whole historic period of Greek and
Roman civilization, with a considerable
overlapping of ancient Egyptian, Baby
lonian civilizations. If there is any rev
erence due to lineage, it should surely be
found here. Yet what are the plain
facts?
The reason Prince Ilirohito assumes
the mikadosbip is that the real mikado is
crazy. Ilirohito himself, from his photo
graphs, doesn't look as if he were any
mental giant. One naturally wonders
how many rulers in that long list, from
the able Jimmu Tenno down, have been
mentally defective, and how far such
royal disabilities contributed to make the
Mikado traditionally "divine and un
approachable while a coterie of strong
nobles did his ruling for him.
This is no slur at Japan, but an irre
sistible comment on royalty as an insti
tution. All of the old European dynas
ties tell the same story that the older a
royal family gets, the less capable it is
of ruling. The stock, in-bred, becomes
thin and weak and diseased and uenr-
asthentic and insane, and this is the
strongest of arguments against heredi
tary rulers.
Postmaster General Hays announces
that he will eliminate red tape from the
Iotofikft department.: Here's hoping 1 De
lias better luck than other department
heads who have tried this elimination pro
cess and got smothered in the tape themselves.

Today's Events
C.UX-JLiKER WANTS PEACE
Now that disarmament looms so large
in the public attention, it is interesting
to bear a word on the subject from a gun
maker himself. Col. I. N. Lewis maker
of the Lewis machine gun, reports that
not one of his factories in England, Bel
gium or France is in operation and he
would rejoice if they never had to be
opened again for the manufacture of
weapons of war.
It bas been said a good many times
that the armament-makers would try to
prevent disarmament. There is plenty
of testimony like this to the contrary.
The spiritual sense that war is wrong is
gradually honeycombing and destroying
the old commercial sense that war is a
necessity.
Even France and wary Japan will come
to see this in time, and other nations
continue steadfastly to point out that the
way to disarm is to disarm, and that the
way to live at peace is to determine to
live at peace, not in continuing prepara
tion for war.
Senator Lodge wants '"gun play" cut
out of the movies. This would be dis

Still Xot So Much Written Last Year
As Year Before.
XEW YORK. Dec. S Reports to the
loth annual convention of the Associa
tion of the Life Insurance Presidents
here today were said to indicate that the
new insurance issued in the United
States in 1021 will amount to l...lo0.iMK)
separate policies for Ss,r:."i.tMbtHf). This
will mark a decrease of three-quarters
of one per cent in the number of policies
compared with lat year, the most pros
perous in life insurance history. The
amount of new insurance thus would be
l." per cent less than that of last year
and 2.(' per cent ahead of that of 1019.
Christinas shoppers are advised not to

Read the Message.
(Boston Herald.)
The proper editorial on the President's
message is one which would advise the
American people to read that document
as it now spreads before them. Women
will now read it with the same atten
tiveness as men;, under an obligation
which both alike owe to their servants in
office. The message breathes the spirit
of Warren Harding, and that is one of
kindness and conciliation and sweet rea
sonableness. If ever a President sought
to do his duty, and to make a success of
bis office, it is the present one. He is try
ing desperately hard, and what is better,
to a very large degree is he succeeding.
Read the message and you will under
stand why.
Read it Before you Criticize.
(Xorth field Xews.)
We notice the state papers are after
the governor for spending money through
the publicity department of the state for
the book just published. ' All matters per
taining to state publicity are takert up
with the governor. It is barely possible
this is good publicity. We hope so, Jhough
we have not read it yet. Anyway, the
governor must have put a lot of time into
it. and he did not do it for personal gain,
lie ditl it for Vermont. One can never
tell about this 'publicity business. It
may be better than some of you lads
think.
A Work in Itself.
(Rutland Herald.)
Crockett's History of Vermont is criti
cised because it does not include the re
ligious history of the state. This in it
self, if it went into denominational mat
ters, as- it must, would easily add two
more volumes to the already volunimous
work.

What Kind of a Day
Do You Wish
Yourself?
Suppose you could make
a wish at the breakfast table
and finally have the wish come
true. Would you say,
"I want this to be a good
day," or
"I'm willing for this day
to drag along?1
If you keep on wishing
your days with the food you
eat, finally the wish is likely
to come true.
Grape-Nuts helps your
wish for a good day. Nothing
miraculous; just the natural
result from right food with
the right taste.
There is a charm of flavor
and crispness in Grape-Nuts
that is like the smile of a good
friend at the breakfast table
And Grape-Nuts, with
cream or milk, is fully nour
ishing feeding the tissues
and glands, the bone and
blood, with just those ele
ments which nature requires
building strength without
any 'heaviness.'
Grape-Nuts is the per
fected goodnessof wheat and
malted barley, scientifically
developed ready to eat frcm

A Grape-Nuts breakfast
or lunch is a practical wish
for good luck.
