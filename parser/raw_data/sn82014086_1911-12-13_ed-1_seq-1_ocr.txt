RIOT AT ARBITRATION
MEETING IN NEW YORK,
Reserve Officers Called and Eight
Rowdies Ejected from Hall.
New York, Deo. 12. A riotous out
break interrupted a large mass meet
ing held at Carnegie hall tonight in
support of the arbitration treaties
which President Taft has proposed
with England and France.
The - outbreak occurred after Nich
olas Murray Butler, president of Co
lumbia university, had read resolutions
urging- the senate to ratify the tree.
ties, and Alfonso G. Koelble, of the
German-American Citizens' league of
the state of New York, stepped to the
front of the platform and moved that
the majority resolution of the United
States senate committee on foreign re
lations be adopted as a substitute for
the declarations contained In the-But
ler resolution. ,
"This declaration Is not a promoter
of peae, tout a breeder of war," he ex
claimed, and the words were scarcely
out of his mouth when men jumped to
either side of the stage and raised
their hands in an apparent signal,
whereupon pandemonium was let loose
In the upper galleries.
Catcalls, groans and hisses made it
Impossible for . Chairman Choate to
proceed hith the meting. Four hundred
prominent men were seated on the
platform, and they were astonished at
the outbreak. A large group at them
held conferences for more than ten
minutes while tse pendemotnium still
reigned. One man on the platform
jumped up and shouted as loud as he
could: That packed gallery is com
posed of a lot of cowards." At this the
shouts in the gallery became louder
and megaphones were brought into use.
Women in evening dress in the boxes
Jumped to their feet, looking at their
escorts as if expecting the throwing
of a bomb. In the midest of the noise
Chairman Choate announced that the
Butler resolutions had been unan
imously adopted. The persons in the
main part of the auditorium took this
as a signal for a counter demonstra
tion. Jumped to their feet, shouted
their approval, and waved their hand
kerchiefs and hats.
Andrew Carnegie was down on the
programme as the next speaker, but
ne sat in apparent amaaement at ttte
Estephen Wise asked for a hearing. He
was met tun such cries as " Shut up,"'
and "Throw him out" from the galler
ies. Above all he shouted: "I. warn
you people in the gallery that no peo
ple in the world will feel so badly at
the result of this meeting tonight as
th Irish leaders In the English par
liament." His reference brought forth an even
stronger iombination of groans and
howls. Koelble, whose resolution had
precipitated thte riot, called to the
people in the gallery to show a spirit
of fair play, but hie appeal was in
vain. Bellowing from megaphones
continued, and both Koelbel and Wise
gave up the attempt to speak. Chair
man Choate was equally unsuccessful.'
The police reserves reached the gallery
by this time and ejected the leaders
of the disturbing element, but no ar
rests were made. Chairman Choats
announced that the meeting would be
adjourned. A dozen men on the plat
form tried to assist him in restoring
order. He said: "The action of the
gallery here tonight has- done more to
cause the ratification of these peace
treaties tnan an the peace speeches
that could be made during the evening.
In virtue of my authority as chairman
of this meeting I declare the meeting
adjourned without the audience listen
ing to the speeches of the other two
gentlemen."
These gentlemen were Andrew Car
negie and Frederick R. Coudert, a well
known lawyer.

POLICE ENTERTAIN
THE SUICIDE THEORY.
Mulatto Mother of Louise Harm an.
However, Denies It.
Philadelphia, Dec 12. The mystery
surrounding the death of 18 years old
Mary H. Harm an the supposed
daughter of John Moon, formerly
policy kangr of Baltimore, was not
cleared, up w4ien Louisa Harman, the
girls mulatto mother, recovered con
sciousness In the hospital here to
nigt.
The woman, who was discovered ly
ing unconscious in a room with the
body of the girl late Sunday night, ds
clared that she cannot explain her
condition or the cause of the girls'
death. She denies that there had been
a sulci d pact and that she had taken
poison or had. given it to Mary. The
latter posed as a white person. When
questioned Mrs. Harman said she did
not know that the girl was read and
knew of no reason why she should
commit -suicide. The police, however.
believe the death of the girl was part
of a suicide pact between her and her
colored mother. For years they say
the girl and mother bad tried to hide
the fact that she had negro blood in
her veins, and it is believed that when
they oame to the end- of their financial
resources they decided to kill them
selves with poison.

Tho champions of presidential prefer
ence primaries and state-wide primar
ies for the selection of tittle-gates to the

They were lad by Senator Borah of
Idaho, who contented himself with a
minority report from the sub-committee
on ca'l, of which he was chair
man, and with a brief speech to the
committee. The meeting was unique
In two respects. There was a com -
plete absence of bitterness, and tlie
proceedings were conducted with open
doors.
Taft M en Control Situation.
Politically, the meeting was pro
Taft. The president's advisors con
trolled the situation. Early in the day
It became apparent that Hocretary
Hilles and Arthur Vorys, national
comml teeman from Ohio, were in
control. The disinclination of Post
master General Hitchcock to endorse
the selection of Col. Harry S. New,
former chairman of the committee,
and a member from Indiana, as chair
man of the sub-committee on arrange
ments, was overcome and Mr. Hitcb--ouk
took no part in Uie proceedings
of the day. The southern committee
men, said to be opposed to Mr. New
for fear that he favored a reduction
,f southern representation, voted lor
the India. nait.
Roosevelt Men Not Conspicuous.
Chairman New announced after the
meetlj.g of the full commititt tlint
his sub-committee would meet in
Chicago on January 8 to begin t
wi.rk of organizing the convention
plans. Tho wishes of the Taft com
mitteemen prevailed throughout the
meeting. Tho Obloans and New York
ers who had given publicity to the
Kt.ctQve.lt propaganda, oontented them
selves with the progress they have
made. Walter Brown, leader of the
Ohio Roosevelt band, took no part in
the proceedings, while National Com
mitteeman William L. Ward of New
York, who did not attad the White
house dinner Monday night, was In
accord with the programme adopted.

To Reduce 8outhern Representation.
Two significant political Incidents
developed during the day. A stipula
tion was made in the call which ren
ders null tho eleUon of delegates to

the call. This will invalidate the Utlua
of delegates already seieoted In Ala

stiitt lion movement by Hepresent&Uv
J nines Francis Burke of Pittsburg, who
championed such a resolution on thu
