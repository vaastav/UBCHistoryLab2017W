liepresentative Richardson, o!
Tennessee, the new leader of tlie
democrats, and Representative Bai
ley, of Texis, tlie old leader, were
both among the thirty one mem
bers who voted against the resolu
tion denying Roberts, of Utah, the
right of being sworn in, in advance
of the investigation of the charge?
against him. These votes were
not cast in favor ol Roberts, but as
a protest against the method in
which the republicans proposed to
get rid of him. Mr. Richardson
explicitly stated thai if Roberts was
guilty he would vote for his ex
pulsion from the House, adding:
'If thero is one thing tlie Auieri
cm people are a unit upon, it is
that the American home shall be
preserved in all its loveliness,
sweetness and purity."
Mr. Roberts stirred up the ad
ministnation menagerie, by saying
that some Marmons, against whom
the charges of living in polygamy
had been brought, had been named
for Federal positions in Utah by
Mr.McKinley and confirmed by the
Senate. Grosvenor, of Ohio, and
and Daliell, of Pa., tou;ht to de-
tion; and consequently on the Sen
ate's own ruling in theCurbett case,
Gov. Stone was not entitled to up
point either (J :ny or anybody else.
If therefore the Senate admits
Quay, they will not only be guilty
ofself-stultificalion.butlhey will ba
guilty of overiding the Legislature
of the great State of Pennsylvania
in a remarkable way forcing up
onlVnnsylvania aSenator whom its
Legislature declined to accept.
Furthermore, if the Senate admit
Quay, there will be a rush for simi
lar admissions, for there are three
other States Delaware, Utah and
California in which the Legisla
tures at lhe last session failed to
elect to vacant Senatorships. and,
in two of the cases Delaware and
Utah the Governors being Demo,
crats, Democratic Senators would
be appointed. Which the Repub
lican Senate would not greatly rul
ish. Besides if Senators are to be
admitted on gubernatorial appoint
ment, the Senate is likely to have
on its hands a polygamy case like
that of the House; for the Govern
or of Utah would most probably
appoint Roberts in the event of his
rejection by the House, cr other
wise an other Mormon. And a case
like the Roberts case the Senate
would not relish at all.
All these considerations, there
fore, militate against the admission
of Quay; and yet, strange lo say,
it is confidently asserted by his
friends that about fiftySenators are
of the democratic Senate ciuii us,
who has bem authorized by the
caucus lo arrange the democratic
representation on the Senate com
mittees, says he will enter a vigor
ous protest against the carrying out
of the republican programme of
decreasing democratic representa
tion on the Senate committees, but
is tho carrying out that programme
is necessary to give the gold men
control of the Seuaie committee on
Finance, and that control is neces
sary to get the gold standard bill
