Tbe death ol NlcbolasJ. Moore, brother

regret throughout the slate. No man

always that upon the coast ol this slate
would be lound all tbe requirements ol
deep water, and that our immense
freightage of cotton would lind an outlet
to F.urope either through Malveslou, the

bow that Colonel Moore was not only a

Another
president's message continued
system is tbe selection, by promo
tion, of all officers of the poveru-
tueut above the lowest grades, ex

lo afford encouragement to the
fa.itli.ttl public servauU by exciting
in tiieir inmds the hope of promo
tion ii they are found to merit it, is
much to be d ;bired ; but would it
be wise to adopt a rule so rigid as
to permit no other ineausof supply
ing the immediate wauls of the ser
ire? There are many persons who
fill subordinate positions with great
credit, but lack those qualities
which arc requisite lor higher posts
of itutv, and because the mode of
1110110 hi. and action of one whose
service in a government bureau has
beeu ion" continued, are that before
we coutiue ourselves with unpor
taut iiiicstious within the bounds
of statutory enactments we may
await tho result ot lurthcr inauirv
aud experiment. The submission of
a porliou of the nominations to a
central board of examiners selected
solely for treating the qualifications
of applicants may, perhaps, without
resorl lo I he competitive test, put
an end to the mischiefs which attend
Ihn present system of appointments,
and it may lie Icnsiblo to vest in
such a board a wide discretion to
H4cerlH.in the characteristics and at
tainiiieuts of candidates iu those
particulars which I have already
rcierrca lo as iieiug no less im
portant than mere intellectual at
tainments. If congress should deem
it advisable at the present session to
establiNh competitive testa for ad
mission lo tho service, no doubts
such ns have been suggested shall do
lor mo Irom giving the measure my
earned support, and earnestly rec-
ommeud, should there bo a failure
to pa-s any other act upon this sub
ject, than an appropriation of $25,-
ihh) per year may lie mado tor the
enforcement of section 1753 of the
revised statutes. Willi the aid thus
adored me I shall strive to execute
the provision oftlie latter according
to its letter, and I am unwilling, in
Justice to present civil servants of
the government, to dismiss this sub
ject without declaring my dissent
Irom tho severe and almost, incrimi
nate censure with which they have
been recently assailed. That they
areas a class indolent, inefficient aud
corrupt, is a statement which has
been often mado aud widely cred
ited ; but when the extent, variotv.
delicacy and importance of their
duties are considered, the great ma
jority ol the employes ot the gov
ernment are, in my judgment, de
serving ot high commeuih-tion.
the contiuuiug . decliue of the
merchant marine of the United
States is greatly to be deplored. In
view of the fact that we furnish so
large a proportion of tho freights of
the commercial world, and that our
shipments are steadily aud rapidly
increasing, it is causo of surprise
that not only is the navigation in
terests diminishing, but it is less
than wlieu our exports and imports
were uot half as large as now either
in bulk or value.
There must be some peculiar hin
drance to tho development of the
interest or entorprise and energy of
the American mechanics and capi
talists who have kept this country
at least abreast of our rivals in the
Irieudly contest for ocean supre
macy. The substitution of irou for
wood and ot steam for sail, have
wrought great revolutions in the
cnrryiug of the trade of the world,
but these changes could uot have
been adverse to America if we had
given to our navigation interest. a
proportion of tho aid aud protec
tiou which have been so wisely be
stowed ou our manufactures. I
commend tbe whole subject to the
wisdom of congress, with the sug
gestion that uo question of greater
magnitude or further reaching
in importance can engage their
consideration. In the year 1875, the
supremo court of the United States
declared iu the constitution that
tho statute of certain slates which
imposed upon the ship owners or
consequences a tax of one dollar
aud tilty cents for each passenger ar
riving from a foreign country, or iu
lieu thereof, required a bond to in
demuify the state aud local authori
ties against the expeuse for future
relief or support of such passenger.
Muce this decision the expense at
tending the care and supervision of
immigrants has talien on the states,
at whose ports they nave landed, as
a large majority of such immigrants
immediately upon their arrival pro
ceed to the island states and the
territories to seek permanent
homes, it is manifestly unjust to im
poso upon states whose shores they
first reach the burden which it now
oears. For this reason, and because
of the vast importance of the sub
ject, I recommend legislation regard
ing me supervision ana transitiv-Tvoi
immigrants at the porta of .debarki
tion.
I regret to state that the people of
Alaska nave reason to complain that
they aro yet unprovided with any
form of government by which lite
aud property can be protected.
While the extent of its population
does not justify the application of
the costly machinery ot territorial
administration. there is au immediate
necessity for constituting such a
form of governmeut as will pro
mote tbe education of the people
and secure the administration of jus
tice. The senate, at its last session.
passed a bill providing for the con
struct ion of a building for the li
brary of congress, but it failed to
become a law. The provision of
suitable protection for that great
collection of books, and for tbe
copyright department connected
with it, lias become a subject of na
tional importance, and should re
ceive prompt atteution.
Tho report ot the commissioner of
the District of Columbia, which
ia herewith transmitted, will
fullv iuforin you of the condition
of attain of the district. Thev
charge the vital, importance ol legis
lation for the reclamation and im
provement of the marshes and for
the establishment of harbor lines
along the Potomac river front. It
is represented that iu their present
condition tnese marshes seriously
affect the health of the residents of
adjacent parts of tho city, and that
they generally mar tbe general as
pect of the park iu which is located
the Washington mouumeut. The
improvement of that park south ot
the executive mansion, a large area
of valuable laud, would trans
form what is now believed to
ba a daugerous nuisance iuto
an attractive lauuscnpe extend
ing to the river frout. They
recommend the removal of this
team railway Hues from the surface
of the streets of ihe city and the lo
cation of Ihe ueccssary depots in
such place as may be convenient for
public arromiiioilauoi), aud they
all attention lo I lie ilclicicnry of
the water supply which seriously
affects Ihe material prosperity aud
the health ami comiortoi iu inhabi
tants. 1 commeud these subjects to
your favorable consideration. The
importance of timely legislation
with respect to tho ascertainment
aud declaration of the vote for presi
dential electors was sharply call
ed to the- atteution of the
people more than four years ago. It
is to be hoped that some well de
nned measure may be devised be
fore another natiouai election which
will render unnecessary a resort to
any expedient of a temporary char
acter for the determination of ques
tions upon coutesieu returns ques
tions which concern the very exist
ence of .the government aud the lib
erties or tne people, and such as
were suggested by tha prolonged
illness ot the late president and his
consequent inability to perform the
iuucuous oi nis onicc. it is pro
vided by the second article of con
stitution, in the fifth clause of the
first section that in case of the re
inoval of the president from office,
or oi nis death, resignation or in
ability to discharge the powers aud
uuues ui saiu oiuce, tue same snail
devolve on the vice president.
vt iiat is the intention ot the consti
tution in its specification of inability
to discharge the powers and duties
of said office as one of the couiin
gencies which calls the vice ore!
tent to the exerciso of presidential
functions? Is the invalidity limited
in us nature to long coutinued in

import.' What must be its extent
audduratiou? (low must its exist
ence be established ? lias the presi-
acnt, wnose inability is the subject
of inquiry.any voice in determining
whether or not it exists, or is the de
cision of that momentous aud deli
cate question contided lo the vice
president, or is it contemplated by
the constitution that congress
should provide by law precisely
what should be the statutory ina
bility, and how and by what tribu
nal or authority it should be ascer
tained? If the inability proves to be
temporary iu its nature, anil during
its continucncc the vice-president
lawfully exercises the funct ion: of
the Executive, by what tenure does
he hold his office? Does he con
tinue as president for the remainder
of the four years term, or
would the elected president, if
his inability should cease in the in
terval be empowered to resume
his office, aud it' having uch lawful
authority he should exercise it,
would the vice president be there
upon empowered to resume his
powers and duties as such. I can
uot doubt that these important
questions will receive your early and
thoughtful consideration. Deeply
impressed with the:grayity of the
responsibilities which have'so unex
pectedly devolved upon me, it
Will be my constant purpose to co
operate with you iu such measures
as will promote the glory of the

THE CHJITRAir TRIAL, SCENES, INCI
DENTS AN1 EFFECT.
The Guile.ttt trial, which seemed
iu the beginning to excite but a lan
guid interest, has grown to be the
paramount question of the day.
1 he crowd that gathers at the court
room door shortly before nine each
morning, grows daily more clamor
ous and more numerous. Judges,
lawyers aud marshals are overrun
with applications for passes to the
best parts of the courtroom. Tbe
remarkable consideration shown by
the otlicer s to the ladies in attend
ance, among whom there is a pre
ponderance of elegantlv attired
belles from the West End. iu gaining
admission 'and finding desirable
seats for them, has been enthusias
tically acknowledged by the gentler
and more curious sex, who testify
l heir appreciation by attending in
daily increasing' numbers, to the al
most complete exclusiou of the meu.
I Ins, ot course, has had tbe ettect ot
drawing forth from the obliterated
divers remarks more forcible than
complimentary concerning the nb
normal curiosity the unhealthy ftp
petite for sensation displayed by
tlicir sellish sisters, cousins and
their aunts. It was distinctly laid
down iu the beginuing, that members
or the bar should be shown the pre
fc re nee ineohtaining admission ; but
during Ihe past lew days a member
ot the bar who could succeed in
barclv forcing his way over the
threshold of the courthouse to cruue
his ueck above the intervening
crowd of bonnets, or. at best, could
obtain a seat ou Ihe railing that en
circles Ihe bodv ot the courtroom
with permission to swing his legs
ou the inside, was lavored imlecd
Most, exasperating of all. it is plain
that in nianv cases the verv same iu
dividual have occupied conspicu
ous seats in the courtroom every

people from Baltimore and adjoin

obtain a single glimpse oT the re

color his act with tbe rnerist shade

turns the inspiration theory on
which rests the insanity plea.
The witnesses tor the prose
cution occupied but a few
days. The well-known story of
the assassination was told over.
Nothing new was developed that
was not kuown months ago. Mr.
Scoville's cross-examination was
confined to strenuous efforts to
f elicit from toe witnesses gome proof
that the signs of strong excitement
were observable in the assassiu be
fore, during or immediately after
the shooting; but they were uuaui
111011s in declaring that his manner
waa
VERY CALX AND DKLlftEKATE.
The atteution of the court aud
jury has since been occupied by the
innumerable witnesses for the de
fense, who either knew the prisoner
at some time ot his life, or some oue
of his many light-brained relatives,
aud who by their testimony iu
ruauy cases far-fetched and irrele
vant hope to show that a taint of
insanity lurks in the Guiteau blood,
showing itself in imbecility, fanati
cism and lunacy, and has, in this oue
instance, amounted to irrepressible
and dangerous mania. Considera
ble sensation was caused on Mon
day, when, after ranch evidence
tending to prove the prisoner's fa
ther fanatical to the degree of in
sanity, John Gni lean, the assassin's
brother, declared from the witness
box that he had not observed any
of these signs in bis father. Not
withstanding this set-back, Ihe tes
timony has had t he effect of unset
tling the preconceptions of many
who were most firmly convinced of
the prisouerVcriminality good, in
telligent, iust men manv of these.
Considering this fact, and consider
ing also the very honest, but by no
means exceptionally intelligent or
discriminating twelve at whom
all this accumulation of evidence
is launched, It is not to be
wondered that it is the general
expectation that by the time all this
has been supplemented by the load
of medical expertness still to come,
they will be bo muddled as to find
it impossible to

Do not brand them with infamy it

rather prepared for grateful sur

come of all this forensic and medical
lore. If a renowned phvsiciau of
me insane pronounces himself una
ble to express a decided opinion
can the horny-hauded sob of toil iu
the jury box who is keeping his
iiiuumiau cars wiueiv siretcneu iu

twelve who are quite as honest and
quite as obtuse on tins hue point?

rulings that always

that he at least is in doubt. In the
face of all this, tho prisoner aud
his counsel are not to be laughed at
asucauly sanguine for expecting au
acquittal.
Mr. Scoville has undertaken
task to which it was supposed much
odium would attach, but his conduct
of Ihe case has won golden opinions
ou every side. Llis sincerity has dis
armed prejudice. He stands before
us iu the light of a man who has
undertaken a loathsome duty for
conscientious reasons, and means to
discharge it lu the least obiectiona-
blc manner possible. He does not
fence. He refuses to take advan
tage of legal technicalities, and
plaiuly indicates that he relies on
the honesty of his plan, and expects
his right to make his might. His
refusal to raise the Question of mal
practice, shows that he has his finger

dress to the jury was pronounced a
masterly effort in legal oratory, yet
it owed nothing to those ornaments
generally called oratorical. It was
simply a plain exposition of his con
viction. He spoke to the jury, not
as a lawyer, but as one honest, sim
pie man argues with another. This
is his striking characteristic, his
plain honesty.
Mr. David ge, who has so far con
ducted the cross-examination for
the prosecution, is a Chevalier Bay
ard and a Lord Chesterfield rolled
iuto one. Nothing could exceed the
venerable old aristocrat's suav
ity, courtesy and consideration, un
less it is his dry Barcasm or his mani
fest disgust at the prisoner's antics,
a disgust that seems to be heartily
shared bv all people. Those antics
mav be tne result of a diseased
mind, they may not. The exact
soundness or unsoundness of this
particular mind will probably be
hereafter a question as universally
mooted, as the rights of ti e Tich-
borne claimant, bnt tor the one mau
who hesitates to adjudge Guiteau to
the gallows, ten thousand fear to see
him acquitted. What a precedent!
Are the thousands ot lauatics whom
irreligious egotism leads away into
wid speculations to be held irre
sponsible for the most portentious
crimes I It is a question whether
those who. by willtiulv iudnlgiug in
morbid, abnormal states of mind
bring themselves to the verge of lu
nacy, do not deserve to suffer the
cousequences just as fully as the
man who with suicidal intent prac
tices bodily harm to himself. T.
