LOOKS TO REPEAL
OF ORGANIC ACT
? i
Bill Framed by Representative
Prouty for Change in Dis
trict Government.
MEASURE WILL ABOLISH
HALF-AND-HALF SYSTEM j
Election of Mayor and Six Commis
sioners Proposed?Representation
in Congress Also a Feature.
Itepreseritative Proutv ? Iowa, a mem
ber of the Hous^ District jmmittee. has j
completed the major portion of the bill
which he expects to introduce outlining a
new form of government for the District
of Columbia.
A statement made last night by Mr. |
Prouty shows that the bill contains para- !
graphs providing for the general election i
of a mayor and also six commissioners, (
who shah constitute a city council. It j
would wipe out the present organic act. ;
which includes the half-and-half system !
of appropriation. The government would j
be exempted from taxation on its land
*nd buildings here. It would assess the j
government, however, for street improve- |
ments where the thoroughfares are wider
than the ordinary, and for half the cost
of the sidewalks around government
buildings. It also provides for a delegate
in Congress, for the initiative. :efereu
dum and recall, and for civil service qual
iiications in almost every case for Dis- ;
trict employes.
Representative Prouty's .solution of |
the problem involved in the govern-j
ir.ent's water works, now controlled by ,
the federal government, is to turn the}
establishment over to the District, but!
the government would have free aerv- ?
ice. The utilities commission would ex-|
ist in principle, but the personnel or!
the commission would be made up of!
the commissioners.
There would he seven departments of
city government?department of educa
tion, public affairs. accounts and
linance, public safety, streets and pub
lic improvements, public property and
parks.
Powers and Duties.
The city government would then have
the duty of levying taxes and making
appropriations, but Congress would still
have a linger on the District by being
able to amend or repeal any ordinance
or resolution made by the council. The
mayor is granted general superv ision.
and would be the chief representative!
of the District. He would aiso be the!
chairman of the boa d of health.
Under the department of public affairs
would come the work now done by the
corporation counsel, the courts, etc. Ths
bus.ness office of the city, whicn now
includes the assessor, auditor, purchasing
officer, market master, etc., woulo come
under the department ot accounts. 1 hd
l#oltce department, fire department, healtn
department, plumbing ami e.ectricai de
partments would compose tne depart
ment of public safety. The existing en
gineer department would be turneu intJ j
the department of streets and public ini- i
provements. The head of this department
would also have supervision o> ^r public
utilities and persons or corporat ons ren
dering service in the city under fian
chises of contracts.
Much of the work done by the board
of charities would be turned over to tne
department of public property, including !
supervision of hospitals, cemeteries. It- l
branes and the "city hall."
The parks would be under the jur sdlc- j
tlon of the superintendent, who would ;
act in conjunction wito a commissioner I
appointed by the President The board |
of education would no longer .-xlst, as i
the commissioner of the department of t
education wo.dd head this activity, but j
the council would be responsible.
In turning over the water system to J
the District of Columbia, trie bill specifies !
that the District must furnish watei
of quality ti.d quantity sufficient to sup
ply the needs of the government, other
wise <he lease would be canceled.
Street Improvements.
The section outlining th- street im
provements is one on which Representa
tive Prouty has worked for severa:
tionths. It provides that the eity council !
?haii assess spec.al Improvements; it
ha. assess against railways the cost of
pavements between the two outside
?.is nn<t two feet on each sid?- thereof,
ihe company being required to keep the
pavement in tood order. In the business
portion of th>- city, where ther?- is not
?nore than sixty fe?t to t>e paved, after
deducting the street railway paving,
thirty feet shall be asses-?-d against
property owners on each side of the
street, in wiiieh shall he included a pro
?:ita cc-s-t ol paving street inspections of
like width.
'T he cost of paving the remaining por
tion of said streets and intersections Khali
be paid one-half bv the Di-,trict of Co
lumbia and one-half by the yovernment i
of the United States." it is provided. This
half-and-half assessment in the residence
section would include the following ar
rangement :
The cost of the sidewalk and curbing
shall be assessed against th?- abutting
property and property owners, If the
amount to be paved on any street does
not exceed thirty feet in width, after de
ducting the amount to be assessed against j
the street railway company, then one-half
'he cost of th>- pavement shall be assessed
against the abutting property and owner t
on each side i>f the street.
"If the amount to be paid after deduct
ing the amount paid by the said street
railway company, shall exceed thirty feet
in width, then the remaining cost of said
pavemer.t shall be paid one-half by the
District of Columbia and one-ha f by the
government of the 1'nited States."
The United States would be responsi
ble for sidewalks and pavements in
front of its own property, just as if it
were a private individual, but this
would not include property used as
parks. All sidewalks in front of parks
would be assessed against that prop
erty. but one-half would be paid by
the L n I ted States. Any other side
walks not provided for would be paid
for on the half-and-half plan.
Civil Service Features.
j
The civil service features of the gov
ernment are found in a section provid
ing for a local civil service commission
composed of three members appointed
by the council, and evidently the bi 1 is
framed so that "outside appointments'
by political pull would be a thing of
the past.
Tiie provision for the recall of the elec
tive officers specifies that at least 2Z per
cent of the total vote cast for mayor'
shall be represented in a petition to rt -
move any elective officer from his posi- j
tion. If the petition complies with the
law th.* election to determine a succes- j
sor must be held within thirty days, j

: the right to fix qualification* for vot

; SENATORS TO INSIST
ON PRECEDENCE RULE1
Will Not Accept Invitations to
Homes Where There
Status Is Ignored.
Hereafter hostesses who desire the pres
ence of United States senators must be
careful to observe the rules of precedence
which have been established for members
of the Senate. So lax have some of the
hostesses of tho National Capital become
in recent months with regard to the ob
servance of the proper rules of prece
dence that a number "of thP senators now
decline to accept invitations to their en
tertainments. it wa.v learned today.
"If the rules of precedence are not to
be observed." said one senator, "those
hosts and hostesses may as well under
stand that they can strike members of
the Senate off their lists of guests. I
have refused several invitations already
on this account, and 1 know of u number
of other senators who have done the
same, and I predict that the number of
those refusing invitation sto these houses
will go 011 increasing."
Plead Previous Engagements.
Of course, it was said, senators merely
plead a previous engagement in refusing
to attend dinners and other entertain
ments at those houses where proper re
gard for precedence is not given.
Senator (Jailinger, republican leader of
the Senate. yesterday obtained unanimous
consent of the Senate for the printing in
the Congressional Record of a statement
carefully prepared by Senator Bacon of
Georgia setting forth the rules of prece
dence so far as the Senate is concerned.
Senator Gallinger also asked that it be re
ferred to the Senate committee on print
ing so that it might be printed as a pub
lic document.
In his statement of established prece
dence, Senator Bacon said that first came
the President, and then, in the following
order, the Vice President, members of
the Sup: erne Court. Secretary of State
and then the Senate.
Senators in Back Seats.
It is said that some* of the hostesses
have been giving precedence over sena
tors to members of the cabinet other than
the Secretary of State and to other high
officials of the government, including
some of the ambassadors to foreign na
tions. All of these officials are confirmed
by the Senate, it has been pointed out.
and should follow the senators in the
matter of precedence on all occasions.
At dinner parties in Washington sena
tors have seen appointive officials siven
the seats of honor, while tile senators
themselves were relegated to other places.
The senators intend that this shall cease
or else they will not attend the enter
tainments. it was said.

One Method Discovered for
Promotion of Campaign
Against High Prices.
Mrs. Ellis Logan, Leader in Move
ment. Canvasses City for Signa
tures to Pledge.
In ail effort to further tlie campaign
for boycotting eggs, Mrs. Ellis Logan
this inorn:ng held a conference at her
home with about twenty-five of her as
sistants in the campaign and discussed
the preparation of foods without eggs as
an ingredient. "We found a good many
dishes which could be prepared without
the use of eggs." declared Mrs. Logan.
"These are easily prepared, and I would
be very glad to confer with any house
wife interested in the campaign about
the preparation of such foods.
Many Names Added.
Mrs. Logan yesterday added about 2,u00
names to her boycott pledge, many of
which were obtained last night at the
reception to delegates to the woman's
suffrage congress given at the Willard
by the National Council of Women
\ oters. "A number of the women with
whom I conferred there," said Mrs. Lo
gan, "declared that they would take up
th** campaigns in their home cities when
they return to them, and will forward
the pledges to Washington."
Mrs. Logan this morninn went to the
meeting of the District of Columbia Fed
eration of Women's Clubs in the Public
Library, where she asked all those pres
ent to sign the protest, and in addition
presented the speaker with one egg as a
token of the campaign which is beiny
wa^ed in this city.
Canvass of Downtown Section.
Mrs. Logan spent the afternoon in the
downtown section getting names to the
egg-boycotting pledge, and in going to
stores where eggs are sold to get first
hand infoi niation on the effects of her
campaign to reduce prices of this product.
Monday night the active campaign will
close, and the big protest will be prepared
to be sent to Congress.
MILLIONS OF EGGS HELD.
Massachusetts Board of Health Re
ports Cold-Storage Conditions.
BOSTON. December ?>.?There were 181,
200,228 eggs held in cold storage in Massa
chusetts October 1 for use as food, ac
cording to the report of the state board
of health, which was made public to
day. Of this number 37,780,200 had been
placed In the storage plants .within three
months. The report did not give the age
of the others Of the whole, an amount
described as 7,;!4o pounds, was condemned
as unfit for food.
The report says that 19,38.*t,098 pounds
of butter was held in cold storage on the
same date.
EGG PKICES IN GOTHAM FALL.
Drop Six Cents a Dozen, Further De- J
clines Being Predicted.
NEW \ OKK, December 6.?Fresh eggs
took a drop of 4 cents a dozen in the j
local market yesterday, making a total j
decline of G cents in two days. Whole
sale prices for some high grades are un
dt-r 40 cents, and dealers predict 30-cent
eggs next week. The reductions are at
tributed by officials of the National '
Housewives' League to the organization's I
egg boycott, which is widespread, ac- I
cording to headquarters here. Egg men
say the chief reason is the increase in
the supply of t!.e new-laid product.
Refrigerated egus also decreased in
cost, a cent all around being the day's
break.
DEFENDS PRICE OF EGGS
AND COLD STORAGE MEN
|
Were It Not for Present System j
Cost Would Increase,
Is Charge.
To the Kditur of The Star: '
As a producer of eggs in a small way,
I have read with much interest and no
little amusement the accounts in the press
of the movement in Washington and
throughout the country to reduce the
price of eggs by means of a boycott.
The efforts of the good ladies seem to be
main)> directed against the price of stor
age eggs, which they consider excessively
high. But is the price high? 1, for one,
do not think so.
These eggs were put into cold storage
last April, when fresh eggs, laid within '
a few days of time of sale, were selling
retail at 2r? cents for the best. The eggs
put into the cold storage warehouses
probably cost 18 to 'JO cents per dozen.
The charges for storage average 1 cent
per dozen per month, in addition to nu
merous overhead charges, such as cost
of crates, hauling and handling, insur
ance, breakage and deterioration, so thai
in the month of December, after being
in storage nearly eight months, the cost
to the warehousemen must be in the
neighborhood of 28 to .*50 cents per dozen.
Mrs Ellis Logan says she has been
offered by an egg dealer 200 cases of
candled storage eggs delivered at one
time at 32 cents per dozen. In order to
get 200 cases of good eggs this dealer
probably had to candle 250 cases, the
excess fifty cases comprising bad eggs
which would have to be destroved and
be a total loss, and those which were
inferior and would have to' be sold at a
reduced price as "seconds." All things
considered, I am of the opinion that Mrs
Logan is getting a bargain.
Discusses Profit.
Storage eggs have been selling .in
the retail stores of Washington at 34
and 35 cents, and now I believe are 37
cents. If the retailer has to pay 32
cents and sells for 40 he is making
only a fair average profit; if he sells
at 35 cents, the figure Mrs. Logan sets
for the retail price he makes next to
nothing. If Mrs. Logan is philanthropic
enough to have these 200 cases of eggs
delivered at her house and sell from
there at cost price no one will say her
nay; but is it fair to the retailer who
cannot afford to commit business sui
cide by selling at cost? Besides what
good would it do? In 200 cases there
are 72.000 eggs?one egg to about everv
five persons in this city. Hut suppose I
the boycott is successful and these i
kind women are able to get the cold
storage men to sacrifice their stock i
and sell at or below cost, what would
l.e the result : Simply that next spring
after their experience of this and last
year, they would not store nearly so
many, with the further result that next
winter there would be a worse short
age than ever. They are not in busi
ness for the public good or to sell at
cost, but to make money for them
selves. Were it not for? the balancing
effect of cold storage, eggs would be
more of a luxury in the fall and early
winter than the> are now and would
be quite beyond the purse of the aver
age housewife. Let us have the facts
and give the devil his due.
Price Due to Scarcity.
As to fresh eggs, they are high be
cause they are scarce, and they are
scarce because in the 'fall and early
winter hens will not lay. and people
who want really fresh, newly laid eggs
and who do not relish the cold-storage
variety must Just pay the price. And
this season they are no higher than
they always have been and always will
be unless we can devise some way to
alter the habits of nature and get the
hens to stop molting and lay con
tinuously.
Every poultryman knows that if he
wants to earn even a modest return on
his investment and for his time and
labor he must find some way to get
eggs from his birds when they are
scarce and high. Any old bird will lay
in the spring and summer, but at' the
high cost of feed, there is little profit
at the prices that prevail at that sea
son of the year. In order to get eggs
in the season of scarcity he has to
raise pullets. But pullets do not lay
until six to eight months old, and
they have to be fed all that time with
out any returns coming in. so that when
they do lay fairly well and more than
pay for their feed, before the poultry- 1
man can make one cent of actual profit I
he has to get back this initial ex
pense, which ordinarily amounts to
from 65 cents to HO cents per bird.
Eggs are no higher than they ought to
be. and as long as this insane rush to
the cities continues and the urban popu
lation increases by leaps and bounds,
while that of the country remains sta
tionary or even in some sections de
creases, just so long, in spite of all the
well meant efforts of these good ladies,
will the price not only of eggs but all
food products, remain 011 a high level.
It is no easy matter to obstruct per
manently the law of supply and demand;
sooner or later it will assert itself. You
may build a wall and temporarily dam
back the rising tide, but eventually it
will overtop and sweep away your pretty
little effort. WILLIAM D. LITTLE.

House Members Accompany
Commissioners on Trip
Over City.
All five members of the House appro
priations subcommittee in charge of the
framing of the District Hudget and the
three District Commissioners are making
it joint inspection today of the various
streets recommended for improvement in
the Commissioners' estimates. Inspec
tions are conducted annually at the con
clusion of the hearings before the com
mittee. but it is seldom that the entire
personnel of this budget-framing body is
represented on the trips made about the
city for the purpose of obtaining first
hand information as to the necessity for
the improvements recommended.
The Commissioners are enthusiastic
over the interest manifested by all the
members of the committee in the work
of providing for Washington's need for
another fiscal year and say that the task
of explaining to the House members the {
various items contained in their esti- 1
mates proved anything but an irksome '
one.
ARMY TRIALS ARE REDUCED.
Interest Shown in Experiments to
Redeem Military Offenders.
The army as well as the navy is deeply
interested in the success of the experi
ments now being made on a large scale
to redeem military offender? who have
not become confirmed criminals through
the separation of the men who have com
mitted breaches of discipline and other
light military crimes and those who have
been guilty of acts of moral turpitude.
Judge Advocate General Crowder dis
cusses this subject in his annual report,
reaching the conclusion that a final ex
pression of opinion upon the question 01"
the propriety of returning to the ranks
of the army the prisoners who have un
dergone the specially rigid training in the
prison organizations should be deferred
until longer experience has been had in
the development of the scheme.
The number of trials of enlisted men by
general court-martial, which was 0 per
cent of the enlisted strength of the army '
in IDs'7, fell to 5.8 per cent in the past I
fiscal year.
U. S. WARSHIPS TO BURN OIL.
Abandonment of Coal Foreshadowed
by Rear Admiral Griffin.
Early abandonment of coal fuel for the
battleships of the L'nitejJ States navy
and the substitution of oil is foreshadowed
in the annual report of Rear Admiral j
It. S. Griffin, chief of the naval bureau
of steam engineering.
He declares that the construction of oil
engines for the Maumee at the New York
navy yard and the elimination of coal
from the designs of new battleships and
destroyers are steps in that direction.
In order to meet the future needs of
the navy for fuel oil. Admiral Griffin
recommends that the Navy Department
immediately should undertake the pro
duction and retining of its own oii. He
points out that the sale of by-products
in the form of gasoline and illuminating
oils will go far toward covering the ex
pense of production and at the same
time furnish the ships with suitable fuel
at a cost below the present price.
DRY DOCKS TOO SMALL.
But Three in Country Capable of Re
ceiving Largest Battleships.
Abnormal development 111 battleship de
sign in the last fifteen years has impaired
the usefulness of dry docks constructed
during the same period at Boston, Ports
mouth, N. H.; Philadelphia, Mare Island,
California and Charleston, S. C. They
were practically outgrown upon comple
tion, and now are inadequate to receive
the largest ships. Rear Admiral H. R.
Stanford, chief of the navy bureau of
yards and docks, makes these statements
in his annual report, and adds that there
are but three dry docks available to re
ceive the largest battleships. These are
at New York. Norfolk and Puget Sound.
The injustice and hardships which civil
engineers of the navy have to undergo,
both as to pay and rank, compared to
their brother officers of the line, in the
opinion of Admiral Stanford, demand im
mediate attention.
Francis Honiker Dies at Age of 70.
Francis Honiker, seventy years old, vet
eran of the civil war and a pensioner,
was found dead in bed in his room ut j
3'Jt> Pennsylvania avenue northwest this
morning. The veteran had roomed there !
the past two years, and recently he had
been attended by a physician to the poor.
His death was due to natural causes. It
is probable his body will be Interred at

To Celebrate Anniversary.
Arrangements have been made by Rev.
Dr. Bishop Johnson, pastor of the Sec
ond Haptist Church, to celebrate tomor
row the thirty-second anniversary of his
pastorate. It is expected that Rev. Dr.
Beckham Fields, secretary of the na

the sermon at the morning services, and
that Rev. L. D. Robinson, pastor of the
Salem Baptj?t Church, will address the
congregation in the afternoon.

Local anglers think they have cause
for serious complaint. Their complaint
is against Uncle Sam, and it grows out
of the alleged filthy condition of the tidal
basin.
"By actual count," said an enthusiastic
angler yesterday, "there were forty-seven
dead rats, two cats and a dog in the
water near the effluent flood gates, to say
nothing of the large quantity of other
debris. It does seem that no such con
ditions should be permitted to exist.
"It is so easy a matter to remedy, he
added. "All that is necesary is to open
the Influent gates and flood the basin.
Not only would it improve sanitary con
ditions, but it would improve the sport
for anglers."
It Is believed by many anglers that the
failure to open the influent gates and
flush the basin is responsible for tne
poor Ashing this season. Angler^ are

night the disconsolate anglers were not
inclined to display their catch to other
sportsmen on the train.
"It's different," said the veteran of the
pair to a friend who wf.s anxious to s<?e
their fish, and wh > had seen the string
of twenty-seven the week before.
"You see," said the veteran, last we' k
the conditions were fine and the hsh
were hungry, but toda> and yesterdaj ,
the water was so high that it was im- ,
possible to find the places where the ;
lish feed." I
Then the anglers willingly discussed the !
catching of the two four-pounders the
week before. .... -
"It was great sport," sa'd Huriey, to
catch a four-pounder Saturday and then
repeat the catch the next day in the
same spot."
"And to catch twenty-live others, add
ed Dulin. .
Last week the two anglers caught onlj
six tish. and none of them weighed over
one and one-lialt pounds.
Jake Moffett, Preston King and W. F.
Mattingly went to Maryland recently, in
the neighborhood of Bushwood, as guests
"f K. A. Mattingly. brother of a member
the party, and three days were spent
from the fields they were agreeably sur
prised by their host, who had provide!
an oyster scald on the shore directly in
front of the home. A tire wa*> started
under a big pot. and luscious bivalves
from private beds were served.
Ward Savage is having more than his
share of trouble with two dogs he ob
tained for use on and iti ill" vicinity
of Masons Island. The animals were
brought from Germany and we e intend- |
<d for one of the wealthier resdents of
the city, but they did not suit, and Ward |
got possession of them ill a trade tor a
inoose head.
W. C. Heflin of the vicinity of Ma
sons has tiie dogs on his farm. He had
as much trouble making the dogs un
derstand him as did Savage when he got
them.
"The trouble was all brought about by
the dogs being German." said Savage,
after one of his German friends had
spoken to the canines and received recog
nition.
"But they know how to trail rabhits."
he said, "and that is the most important
thing."
J. O. B. Gray of the first police pre
cinct, D. T. Gray, his brother, and W. A.
Wenner recently . visited Rosita, King
George county, Va., and participated in
sport on the fields behind the dogs.
"Game is more plentiful in that section
of the state than it is nearer this city,"
said one of the hunters, "and it may be
because there are not so many 'gunmen"
around."
During the few days spent in the coun
try the trio killed ninety quail and fifty
rabbits. One of them got a shot at a
wild turkey.
"That was all he did get " commented
one of the trio, "for the turkey is still
flying."
Ellwood W. Andrews and Karl Grinder
recently entertained Ringgold Hart on a
gunning trip to the vicinity of Indian
Head, and the Washington sportsman
noticed that game on the government
reservation, where shooting is not per
mitted, is plentiful.
"The birds and rabbits seem to under
stand where the dividing line is." said
Hart, "and they fairly flock to the pro
tected zone."
"It ^eems singular to walk through the
woods outside the reservation without
seeing much game." he remarked. "The
minute you step over the line rabbits
and quail show up in .arge numbers, and
you can't shoot."
The gunners killed fight quail and nine
rabbits. While on the river front Earl
Grinder hauled a small seine, but caught
only a few fish. A haul he made the fol
lowing day netted him a barrel of bass.
A. S. Rabbitt of the District surveyor's
office and his brother Irving were guests
of S. T. Carpenter, in Madison county,
Va., recently.
"We had a successful outing," said one
of the sportsmen when he returned. "W e
killed 117 birds, 54 rabbits and a coon."'
Patrick Riordan last Sunday tried his
luck fishing at Great Falls, Va., and re
turned with four large bass.
"You can get them near the city," he
said, "just as well as you can fifty miles
away."
Alexander Potts, one of the best known
sportsmen in King George county. Va..
killed five wild turkeys one day last
week. It is-said he kills more turkeys
each season than any other gunner in
the state.
John W. Hurley yesterday received a
dozen fine small-mouth bass from George
W. Leopold. The fish were caught near
Weverton. The water was in fine condi
tion, Leopold reported, and fish are bit
ing freely. Many Washington anglers
arranged to try their luck tomorrow.

BY TWO NEEDLE VICTIMS
Girls Who Had Experience
Identical With That of Mrs.
Graff See Prisoner.
South American Student of Phar
macy Held in $20,000 Bail
at Newark, N. J.
NEWARK, X. J., December tf??Armand I
Megaro. the South American student of j
pharmacy held in $2o,<n?o bail, accused of j
sticking1 a needle in the arm uf Mrs.
Marjorie Graff at a theater, was con
fronted today with other women who re
ported similar experiences recently. Mrs.
GrafT fainted after feeling the needle
point and the other two victims say they
felt marked drowsiness. While physi
cians dlsagTee as to whether a subtle and
powerful narcotic poison could be in
stantaneously Injected from a needle, so
cieties for the prevention of crime have
taken up the matter ip an effort to de
termine if Megaro has tried to get young
girls in his power.
Miss Jeannetie Clark, nineteen years
old, and Miss Mary I>ee, a young ste
nographer. were called to police head
quarters to look Megaro over. Both sir >
say they were stuck by needles in New
ark theaters.
Experience of Miss Clark.
Miss Clark's experience was identical
with that of Mrs. Graff, and occurred
in the same theater. Miss Clark said
that she occupied an orchestra seat
next to a box and saw a dark-com
plexioned young man leaning over the
rail the moment before she felt the
sting on her hand. Her hand became j
numb, and the feeling spread quickly,
a.s in Mrs. Graft's case, to her entire
arm. She left the seat and hurried to
the women's waiting room. There she
was on the verge of collapse when an
attendant revived her.
Aided by Young Men.
Miss L.ee said she was in a box in an
other theater when ^he was stuck by a
needle. She became faint and two young
men who were in the box aided her,
telling theater attaches that they were
her relatives. Her sister arrived, how
ever, and the young men made off.
There is a drug whose effects parallel
those described bv these three women,
according to Dr. Joseph A. Shears, an
assistant to the health commissioner of
New York city. A charge of one grain,
he said, would kill; a quarter of a grain
might kill, while one one-hundredth of a
grain, injected into the blood, wou'd
speedily cause unconsciousness for sev- j
eral minutes. The drug. Dr. Shears j
added, had come into somewhat general
use among physicians recently in the j
treatment of delirium tremens, adminis-!
tered in infinitesimal amounts as a seda- j
tive.

A Change of Business
A man may make a failure in one line of
business when the expenditure of a similar
amount ot brains and backbone will bring
profitable results in another business.
Success comes more often from the
choice of a business to which one is titted
than in an endeavor to adapt one's self to a
business ill chosen. If you are in the wrong
business, sell it or exchange it for one more
