Charles M. Hatfield, the young man
of Los Angeles'who is called a "rain
maker," was in San Francisco recently
on his way from Grass valley, where
he claims to have' fulfilled a contract
to break the drought that afflicted that
region for 192 consecutive days, says
the San Francisco Examiner.
Hatfield was called to Grass valley
by a message from the South Yuba
Water company, offering him $250 to
break the drought, or $10 for each inch
of rain up to five inches within one
week. This was about Nov. 14. The
storm arrived a few days ago, and now
tho South Yuba reservoirs are full of
water.
"I succeeded all right and got my
money," said Hatfield. "When I ar
rived my employers sent me to Lake
Spauiding, one of the reservoirs in the
high Sierras, at an elevation of 5,000
feet. There I conducted my thirtieth
successful test in California, my first,
however, out of the southern portion of
the state. I broke the greatest drought
California had suffered from in fifty
years.
"We had two rains. The first was a
fall of 1.10 inches the second was In
eighteen inches of snow. That my ex
periment was responsible for the unu
sually heavy downpour is proved by
the fact that it was the heaviest in all
that region. My work done, I came
here because I understood the board of
supervisors of Marin county wished
me to make a test in the vicinity of
Ban Rafael,

"In. April I go under'contract from
the British government to one of its
colonies where the soil is rich in pre
cious minerals, but owing to the scarce
rainfall no water' can be had. I have
articles of agreement signed and seal
ed, and I leave here April
Hatfield denies, that he is a "rain
maker." He prefers to be styled "rain
attracter." "I do not force nature I
assist it When there is an unusual
drought there must be a cause for it.
I remove the cause and produce the
effect. Nature will respond freely and
willingly to any artificial assistance.
It doesn't take much to produce re
sults. There is surely as much .feasi
bility in the idea of rain attraction as
there is in the artificial production of
plants. The process of rain attraction
is merely an intelligent means of get
ting at existing conditions. Fifty years
from now every state, every city in the
Union will have its rainmaking

TINY SCHOOL MUSEUMS.
Or, Wilson's Plan to InterSSit Pa pile
In Foreign Countries.
Dr. William P. Wilson, director of the
Philadelphia museums, has introduced
an innovation in the matter of arous
ing enthusiasm in works of travel, nat
ural products and manufactures and
history among school children, says the
Philadelphia Public Ledger. He has
arranged to supply the city libraries
with miniature museuihs depicting the
life, manners, customs and occupation^
of the different countries of the world
as well as their natural and manufac
tured products.
These museums, which will be pack
ed in boxes, each box representing a
country, will be loaned to teachers of
schools for two weeks at a time. On
its return a box containing studies of
another country may be borrowed. The
boxes will contain about 200 specimens
each and dozens of up to date photo
graphs. Already the exhibits of ten
countries have been completed, and in
a few weeks Dr. Wilson expects to have
every country on the globe represented.

Big Tree Like a Volcano.
Flames issuing from the top of a live
redwood tree is the eight that can be
seen in the State park in the Big Basin,
says a Santa Cruz correspondent of the
Ban Francisco Call. This Is the third
time in fourteen months that flame*
have been visible. The fire is burning
constantly, but at times so slowly that
it is not perceptible. The heart of the
tree Is decayed, and it burns like punk
until the blaze burns a hole through
the trunk. This forms a vent and
causes the smoldering embers to burst
into flames. The tree was 140 feet in
height when it first took fire. Now tt
is but ninety feet high.
Alphabetic Service.
A novel prayer service commenced
recently at the Hartwell Presbyterian
church which will continue for twenty
six days, says the Cincinnati Enquirer.
The other day the prayers were for all
members of the congregation whose
names begin with "A." The next day
those whose names begin with "B"
were to be prayed for, and so on all
through the alphabet. The service was
devised by the pastor, Dr. Charles F.
Walker. ..

CHAPTER XIV.—Continued.
She had strength enough lert to place
the rifle out of harm's way before she
broke down and sobbed not tearfully,
but In a paroxysm of reaction. Soon
all was quiet beneath save for the la
bored efforts of some wounded men to
get far away from that accursed rock.
Jeuks was able to turn to Iris. He en
deavored to allay her agitation and
succeeded somewhat, for tears came,
and she cluug to him. It was useless
to reproach him. The whole incident
was unforeseen. She was herself a
party to it. But what an escape!
"You have been a very good little
girl and have earned your supper," he
said.
"Oh, how can you talk so callously
after such an awful experience?" she
expostulated brokenly.
"It is a small thing to trouble about,
sweetheart," he explained. "You spot
ted the enemy so promptly and blazed
away with such ferocity that they nev
er got within yards of me."
"Are you sure?"
"I vow and declare that after we
have eaten something and sampled our
remaining bottle of wine I will tell you
exactly what happened."
"Why not now?"
"Because I must first see to Mir Jan.
I bundled him neck and crop into the
cave. 1 hope I did not hurt him."
"You are not going down there
again?"
"No need, I trust."
He went to the side of the ledge, re
covered the ladder which he had has
tily hauled out of the Dyaks' reach aft
er bis climb, and cried: ,v,......
"Mir Jan."
"Ah, sahib! Praised be the name of
the Most High, you are alive. I was
searching among the slain with a sor
rowful heart."
The Mohammedan's voice came from
some little distance on the left
"The slain, you say. How many?"
"Five, sahib."
"Impossible! I fired blindly with the
revolver and only bit one man hard
with the Iron bar. One other dropped
near the wood after I obtained a rifle."
"Then there bp six, sahib, not reckon
ing the wounded. I have accounted
for one, so the miss sahib must have"—
"Whathe s'aylng about me?" in
quired Iris, who had risen and joined
her lover.
"He says you absolutely staggered
the Dyaks by opening fire the tnoment
they appeared."
"How did you come to slay one, Mir
Jan?" he continued.
"A son of a black pig followed me
Into the cave. I waited for him in the
darkness. I have just thrown his body
outside."
"Well done! Is Taung S'All dead by
any lucky chance?"
"No, sahib, if he b- :iot the sixth. 1
will go and sec."
"You may be attacked."
1
"I have found a sword, sahib. You
left me no cartridges."
Jenks told him that the clip and the
twelve packets were lying at the foot
of the rock, where Mir Jan speedily
discovered them. The Mohammedan
gave satisfactory assurance that he un
derstood the mechanism of the rifle by
filling and Adjusting the magazine.
Then he wewf to examine the corpse of
the man who lay In the open near the
quarry path.
The sailor stood in instant readiness
to make a counter demonstration were
the native assailed. But there was'no
sign of the "Dyaks. Mir Jan returned
with the news that the sixth victim of
the brief yet fierce encounter was a
renegade Malay. He was so confident
that the enemy had enough of it for
the night that after recovering Jenks'
revolver, he boldly went to the well
and drew himself a supply of water.
During supper Jenks told Iris so
much of the story as was good for her
—that is to say, he cut down the casu
alty list.
It was easy to see what had hap
pened. The Dyaks, having missed the
Mohammedan and their water bag,
searched for him and heard the con
versation at the foot of the rock.
Knowing that their presence wlis sus
pected, they went back for re-enforce
ments and returned by the shorter and
more advantageous route along Turtle
beach.
Iris would have talked all night, but
Jenks made her go to sleep by pillow
ing ber head against his shoulder and
smoothing liet tangled tresses with bis
hand.
He managed to lay her on a com
fortable pile of ragged clothing and
then resumed his vigil. Mir Jan of
fered to mount guard beneath, but
Jenks bade him go within the cave and
remain there, for the dawn would soon
be upon tlieiu.
Left alone with his thought*, he won
dered what the rising sun would bring
in its train. He reviewed the events
of the last twenty-four hours. Iris and
he—Miss Deane, Mr. Jenks, to each
other—were then undiscovered in their
refuge, the Dyaks were gathered
around a roaring fire in the valley, and
Mir Jan was keen in the hunt as the
keenest among them. Now Iris was
his affianced bride, over twenty of the
enemy were killed and many wounded,
and Mir Jan, a devoted adherent, was
seated beside the skeleton ia the gloom
of the cavern.
A period of reflection could hardly
pass without a speculative dive into
the future. If IbIb and he were res

went forth once more into the busy

marriage to a discredited and cashiered
officer? What was it that poor Mir
Jan called himself—"a disgraced man?"
Yes. that was it. Could that stain be
removed? Mir Jan was doing it. Why
not he—by other means, for his good
name rested on the word of a perjured
woman? Wealth was potent, but not
nil powerful. He would ask Iris to
wait until he came to her unsoiied by
slander, purged of this odium cast up
on him unmerited.
To awake her he kissed her he knew
not, perchance it might be their last
kiss on earth. Not yet dawn, there was
morning in the air, for the first faint
shafts of light were not visible from
their eyrie owing to its position. But
there was much to be done.
The canvas awning was rolled back
and the stores built into barricade in
tended to shelter Iris.
"What is that for?" she asked when
she discovered its nature. He told her.
She definitely refused to avail herself
of any such protection.
"Robert, dear," she said, "If the at
tack comes to our very door, so to
speak, surely I must help you. Even
my slight aid may stem a rush in one
place while you are busy in another."
He explained to her that if hand to
hand fighting were necessary he would
depend more upon a crowbar than a
rifle to sweep the ledge clear. She
might be in the way.
"Very well. The moment you tel)
me to get behind that fence I will do
BO. Even there I can use a revolver."
That reminded him. His own pistol
was unloaded. He possessed only five
more cartridges of small caliber. He
placed them in the weapon and gave it
to her.
"Now you have eleven men's lives in
your hands," he said. "Try not to miss
if you must shoot."
In the dim light he could not see the
Bpasm of pain that clouded her face.
No Dyak would reach her while he
lived. If lie fell, there was another use
for one of those cartridges.
The sailor had cleared the main floor
of the rock and was placing his four
rifles and other Implements within easy
reach when a hiss came from beneath.
"Mir Jan!" exclaimed Iris.
"What now?" demanded Jenks over
the side.
"Sahib, they comer'
"I am prepared. Let that snake
get back to his hole in the rock, lest a
mongoose seize him by the head."
Mir Jan, engaged in a scouting expe-1
dition on his own account, understood
that the officer sahib's orders must be
obeyed. He vanished. Soon they heard
a great crackling among the bushes on
the right, but Jenks knew even before
be looked that the Dyaks had correctly
estimated the extent of his fire zone
and would keep out of it.
The first physical Intimation of the
enemy's design they received was a
..agent but pleasant smell of burning
pine, borne to them by the northerly
breeze and filling the air with its aro
ma. The Dyaks kindled a huge fire.
The heat was perceptible even on the
ledge, but the minutes passed and the
dawn broadened into day without any
other result being achieved.
Iris, a little drawn and pale with sus
pense, said, with a timid giggle:
"This does not seem to be so very
serious. It reminds me of my efforts
to cook."
"There Is more to follow, I fear, dear
one. But the Dyaks are fools. They
should have waited until night fell
again after wearing us out by constant
vigilance all day. If they Intend to em
ploy smoke it would be far worse for
us at night."
Phew! A volume of murky vapor
arose that nearly suffocated them by
the first whiff of its noisome fumes. It
curled like a'black pall over the face of
the rock and biotted out sea and sky.
They coughed incessantly and nearly
choked, for the Dyaks had thrown wet

seaweed on top of the burning pile of
dry wood. Mir Jan, born In interior In
dia, knew little about the sea or its
products, and when the savages talked
of seaweed he thought they meant
green wood. Fortunately for him, the
ascending clouds of smoke missed the
cave or infallibly he must have been
stilled.
"Lie flat on the rock!" gasped Jenks.
Careless of waste, he poured water
over a coat and made Iris bury her
mouth aud uose in the wet cloth. This
gave her immediate relief, and she
showed her woman's wit by tying the
sleeves of the garment behiud her neck.
Jeuks nodded comprehension and fol
lowed her example, for by this means
their hands were left free.
The black cloud grew more dense
each few seconds. Nevertheless, owing
to the slope of the ledge and the tend
ency of the smoke to rise, the south
side was far more tenable than the
north. Quick to note this favorable cir
cumstance, the sailor deduced a fur
ther fact from it. A barrier erected on
the extreme right of the ledge would
be a material gain. lie sprang up,
dragged the huge tarpaulin from its
former location anil propped It on the
handle of the pickax, driven by one
mighty stroke deep into a crevice of
the rock.
It was no mean i.'eat of strength that
he performed. He swung the heavy
and cumbrous canvas into position as
if it were a dust cloth. Ho emerged
from the gloom of the driven cloud red
eyed, but triumphant. Instantly the
vapor on the ledge lessened, and they
could breathe, even talk. Overhead
and in front the smoke swept in ever
increasing density, but once again the
sailor had outwitted the Dyaks' ma
neuvers.
"We have won the first rubber," he
whispered to Iris.
Above, beneath, beyond, they could
see nothing. The air they breathed
was hot and feticl. It was like be
ing immured in a foul tunnel, and al
most as dark. Jenks looked over the
parapet He thought he could distin
guish some vague figures on the sands,
so he fired at thein. A volley of an
swering bullets crashed into the rock
on ull side s. The Dyaks had laid their
plans well this time. A firing squad
stationed beyond the smoke area and
supplied with all the available guns
commenced and kept up a smart fusil
lade In the direction of the ledge in
order to cover the operations of the
scaling party.
Jenks realized that to expose himself
was to court a serious wound and
achieve no useful purpose. He fell
back out of range, laid down his rifle
and grabbed the crowbar. At brief In
tervals a deep hollow boom came up
from the valley. At first it puzzled
them until the sailor hit upon an ex
planation. Mir Jan was busy.
The end of a strong, roughly made
ladder swung through the smoke and
banged against ihe ledge. Before
Jenks could reach It those hoisting it
into position hastily retreated. They
were standing in front of the cave, and
the Mohammedan made playon them
with a rifle at thirty feet.
4
Jenks, using bis crowbar alPa lever,
toppled the ladder clean over. It fell
outward and disconcerted a section of
the musketeers.
"Well done!" cried IrIs.:U=-'
The sailor, astounded by her tone,
gave her a fleeting glance. She was
very pale now, but not with fear. Her
eyes were slightly contracted, her nos
trils quivering, her lips set tight and
her chin dimpled. Resting on one knee,
with a revolver in each hand, she seem
ed no puling mate for the gallant man
who fought for her.
There was no time for further speech.
Three ladders wens reared against the
rock. They were so poised and held
below that Jenks could not force them
backward. A fourth appeared, its
coarse shafts looming into sight like
the horns of somj gigantic animal.
The four covered practically the whole
front of the ledge save where Mir Jan
cleared a little space on the level.
The sailor was standing now, with
the crowbar clinched in both hands.
The firing in the valley slackened and
died away. A Dya face, grinning like
a Japanese demon, appeared at the top
of the ladder nearest to Iris.
"Don't fire!" shouted Jenks. And the
iron bar crushed downward. Two oth
ers pitched themselves half on to the
ledge. Now both crowbar and revolv
er were needed. Three ladders were
thus cumbered somewhat for those be
neath. and Jenks sprang toward the
fourth ar.f jren were

crowding it like ants. Close to his feet
lay an empty water cask. It was a
crude weapon, but effective when well
pitched, and the sailor had never made
a better shot for a goal in the midst
of a hard fought scrimmage than he
made with that tub for the head of the
uppermost pirate.
4
Another volley came from the sands.
A bullet plowed through his hair and
sent his sou'wester flying. Again the
besiegers swarmed to the attack. One
way or the other they must succeed.
A man aud a woman—even Such a man
and such a woman—could not keep at
bay an infuriated horde of fifty sav
ages fighting at close quarters and un
der these grievous conditions.
Jenks knew what would happen. He
would be shot while repelling the scal
ing party. And Iris! Dear heart! She
was. thinking of him.
Now both crowbar and revolver were
needed.
"Keep back!" They can never gain
the ledge!" she shrieked.
And then, above the din of the fu
sillade, the yells of the assailants and
the bawling of the wounded, there
came through the air a screaming, tear
ing, ripping sound which drowned all
others. It traveled with incredible
speed, and before the sailor could be
lieve his ears—for he wcfll knew what
it meant—a shrapnel shell burst in
front of the ledge and drenched the
valley with flying lead.
Jenks was just able to drag Iris flat
against the rock ere the time fuse op
erated and the bullets flew. He could
form no theory, hazard no conjecture.
A11 he knew was that a twelve pounder
shell had flown toward them through
space, scattering red ruin among the
amazed scotmdrels beneath. Instantly
he rose agafn, lest perchance any of the
Dyaks should have gained a foothold
on the ledge.
The ladders were empty. He could
hear a good deal of groaning, the foot
steps of running men and some dis
tant shouting.
"Sahib!" yelled Mir Jan, drawn from
his retreat by the commotion without.
"Yes," shouted Jenks.
The native, in a voice cracked witi
excitement told him something. The
sailor asked a few rapid questions to
make quite sure that Mir Jan wdfs not
mistaken. S
Then he threw his arms round Iris,
drew her close and whispered:
"My darling, we are saved! A war
ship has anchored just beyond the
south reef, and two boats filled with
armed SP-' ^-NING ashore."

A Thousand Dollar's Worth of Good.
A. H. Thurnes, a well known coal
operator of Buffalo, Oo., writes, "I have
been afflicted with kidney and blad
der trou'jle for years, passing gravel
or stones with excruciating pain. 1
got no relief from medicines until 1
began taking Foley's Kidney Cure,
then the result was surprising. A few
doses started the brick dust like fine
stones and now I have no pain across
my kidneys and 1 feel like a new man.
It has done me a $1,000 worth of good."
