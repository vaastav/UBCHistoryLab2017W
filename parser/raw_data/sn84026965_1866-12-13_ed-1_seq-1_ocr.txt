Letter from Hon. Benj. F. Perry.
COLUxMBIA, S. C, Nov. 50.
Chas. W. Woodward, Esq., Philadelphia:
My Dear Sir : In your reply to my let?
ter on the constitutional amendment, you
express the opinion that "this measure
will be dropped by the Eadicals for one
Which they deem more humiliating to the
people.of the South, viz: universal suf?
frage. Hon. Horace Greely (the most
prominent candidate for the united States
Senate from the State of New York)
writes me as follows: 'In my judgment
the true basis of settlement of all our
troubles is universal amnesty, with im
Eartial suffrage. In other words, I would
. ave all disabilities because of rebellion
and because of color, utterly and abso?
lutely abolished; and (coming to the
point) I strongly hope and trust that a
settlement on this basis will be made at
"Washington this winter.' This he wrote
in reply to a letter I addressed to him, in
which I put the question as to whether
the Southern delegates to Congress would
be admitted, in the event of their respec?
tive States adopting the amendment."
I do not believe, as it is rumored, that
President Johnson intends to abandon his
policy of reconstruction, or that he will
attempt to interfere with any of the States
in regulating, as they may see proper, the
right of suffrage. Nor do I see any rea?
son to hope that the present or the next
Congress will accept of any compromise
without universal suffrage for all the ne?
groes in the Southern States. I am, like?
wise, unwilling to believe that the South?
ern people will adopt any compromise
which will disfranchise one-fifth of the
white votes, for the purpose of enfran
chising a few hundred negroes in tho
Southern States.
. Impartial suffrage may be accomplish
ed by permitting all persons, black and
white, to vote who are twenty-one years
old. This the Southern people will never
consent to, as it would degrade the right
of suffrage and demoralize the Govern?
ment and society. It may be accomplish
ed by restricting the right ot suffrage in
tho Southern States to such persons,
black or white, who have a property
qualification and can read and write.
This would disfranchise about ono-fifth of
the present number of white voters, and
confer the right of suffrage on a few hun
dred negroes who own the property qual?
ification and can read and write. Are the
Southern people willing to disfranchise
and degrade one-fifth of thomselves, and
elevate a few hundred or a few thousand
negroes above this fifth in all political
rights and privileges? I do not think so.
According to the last census, there are
over 200,000 white males over tho age of
twenty-one in the Southern States who
cannot read and write. Many thousands
of this number fought gallantly through?
out the whole war for tho right of self
government. Are they now to be volun
tarily deprived by their comrades in arms
of this inestimable right, and reduced to
a level with their former slaves ? It may
bo that their freedmen, having the quali
fication of property and can read and
write, will be placed above them ! They
will have the mortification of seeing
themselves excluded from the polls, whilst
their former slaves are permitted to vote!
rv.-Every Southern.man knows that thore
are a great many men of substance and
character in the Southern States who can?
not read and write, and especially old
men.' They are men of intelligence, pa?
triotism and excellent judgment, and as
capable of exercising prudently the right
of suffrage as any one, no matter how
well educated he may have been. They
have enjoyed this right, too, throughout
their manhood, and valued it as sacred
and inestimable.
. It is well known, too, that there are
hundreds of thousands of young men in
the Southern States who were gallant
soldiers and officers in our army, desti?
tute of the property qualification requi?
site to entitle them to vote. They have
been well educated, and are the sons of
many of our most respectable citizens,
and some of them have been Colonels and
Generals in the Confederate army. Are
they, with all their.respectability, virtue,
education and distinction, to be disfran?
chised by this compromise and placed
upon an equality with the negro, or be?
low him, as to the right of suffrage ?
At the organization of the State Gov?
ernments, during, and immediately after
the American Revolution, there were a
great many restrictions imposed on the
right of suffrage. The example of Groat
Britain had its influonco on the judgment
of our ancestors iu regulating this right.
But as time progressed, and republican
principles were Detter understood and
more highly appreciated, these restric?
tions were all swept away, except in one
or two States, by a more liberal and just
public opinion. All free white male per?
sons, over the age of twenty-one, have
been allowed to voto in all the Southern
States, for many years past, who are cit?
izens. No other qualification is required.
In my opinion, this is right and proper,
and should be adhered to, as sacred to re?
publican principles. Its abandonment at
this time, and tho disfranchisemcnt of
two or three hundred thousand voters,
would be a sad grievance. Thoy are lia?
ble to taxation, to work on the roads, do
military and police duty, and when ne?
cessary, to defend their country at the
sacrifice of their lives.
J^If the proposed compromiso simply en?
franchised negroes, who could read and
write, and had a property qualification,
without disfranchising white persons, it
might, with reason and propriety, be ac?
corded to by the Southern States. There
is sound philosophy, public policy and
justice in permitting, as they do in some |
of the Northern States, negroes to vote j
who have a property qualification, and
can read and write. It would be a stim?
ulus to their good conduct and elevation,
morally and intectually. It would be a
safety-valve to their superior intelligence
and industry. Such negroes in the North?
ern States, as a friend of mine recently
informed me, "generally vote with the
least Eadical party." In North Carolina
when such negroes were allowed to vote
in that State, Mr. Stanley declared in the
House of Representatives, "always voted
with the gentlemen." In Connecticut,
very recently, this class of negroes voted
against conferring general suffrage on
their whole race. They said, "let them
show themselves worthy of suffrage, as
we have done, and they can obtain it."
The proposed constitutional amendment
disfranchises all in the Southern States
who had ever taken an oath to support
the Constitution, and afterwards aided or
countenanced the warinanyway. The
unanimous opinion of the South has been
that such terms wero dishonorable and
self-degrading. I would ask, in all can?
dor and sincerity, if those of impartial
suffrage are not equally so ? It it be dis?
honorable to deprive two or three hun?
dred thousand prominent men in the
Southern?States of the right .of holding
office, is it not equally dishonorable and
degrading to deprive the same number of
humblo, though worthy men, who have
fought through our struggle for self-gov?
ernment, of the right of participating at
all in the Government unider which they
have to live 1 In my opinion, it is worse.
They who are sacrificed by tho amend?
ment are allowed to vote ; but they who
are to be sacrificed by "impartial suffrage-'
are deprived of this right altogether.
This exclusion, too, is to apply only to
the Southern States. In tho North the
same class of persons are allowed to exer?
cise the right of suffrage.
I know it has been urged that this
qualified impartial suffrage will only ex?
clude those who are not so well qualified
to voto, and thereby improve our repre?
sentatives and civil officers. Dr. Frank?
lin illustrated his views on this subject by
stating a case. In his day and time, there
was a property qualification of ?350 for a
voter in Pennsylvania. A man had a
jackass worth this sum, and he was al?
lowed to vote. Before the next election,
his jackass diod, and ho could not vote.
"Querrio," said tho doctor, "did the man
or the jaukass vote ?" There are thou?
sands, as every one knows, who are poor,
and yet more wise, and virtuous, and pa?
triotic, than those who are rich.
The last State Convention in South
Carolina abolished all property qualifica?
tions for holding office, as well as of vo?
ting. There is at this time a great refor?
mation in progress in England as to the
extension of the right of suffrage. And
can it be that we are now disposed to
turn back the clock of civilization and
Republicanism one hundred years, and
commence again whero our ancestors
started in 1776 ?
I have said that I do not believe the
present or ensuing Congress will aceept
anything but unqualified negro suffrage
from the .'Southern States. This alono
will give them, as they supposo, power
and influence in the Southern States, and
enable them to control the Government
in all time to come. "Impartial suffrage"
will not do this, as it would exclude, with
few exceptions, the wholo negro race.
Horace Groeley proposes too kind a mode,
and is too generous and liberal in his
views, to be any longer the representa?
tive and exponent of the ultra-Radical
party. This honor has devolved on tho
Chief Justice, and such men as Gen. But?
ler, Sumner and Stevens.
In order to induce the Southern peoplo
to adopt "impartial suffrage," it is pro?
posed to connect with it a general and
universal amnesty. This is certainly a
most desirable boon for the Southern
States. But I do not see that thoy are
in any great peril. Almost eveiy one
has been pardoned by taking the amnesty
oath, or by special application for Execu?
tive clemency. There is no danger of
prosecutions for treason or confiscation,
whilst President Johnson remains in of?
fice. No matter what unconstitutional
legislation may pass Congress, it cannot
be enforced oxcept through tho President.
Exclusion from Congress will continue;
but this is no great, vital sacrifice for tho
Southern peoplo to make. Their mem?
bers once voluntarily withdrew from Con?
gress, and it has been six years since wo
were represented there. We should be
in a hopeless minority at present, if our
members had their seats, and they could
do nothing for their constituents or tho
country. We should devote all our ener?
gies to the material improvement of the
South, and abandon politics, until the
times are more propitious and there is a
returning sense of justice at the North.
It is possible that a national conven?
tion of all the States, composed of their
best and wisest and greatest men, might
revise our Federal Constitution, and ad?
just all difficulties between the two great
sections of tho Republic. If such a propo?
sition was made by the North, the South
would accede to it. This grand tribunal
would command the respect of both sec?
tions, and be worthy of settling ail diffi?
culties between thirty-six sovereign
States. The association of wise, patriotic
and virtuous men, from all parts of the
country, convened for the purpose of re?
storing peace and harmony to the nation,
would have a salutaiy influence. No
danger could possibly result from such a
convention, for their action would have
to bo submitted to the States for their
adoption, and bo ratified by throe-fourths
of them, before it becomes a part of the
Federal Constitution. If two-thirds of
tho State Legislatures will make the ap?
plication for such a convention, the Con?
stitution rr.akesit imperative on Congress
to order its assembling.
I do not, never have, and never will
despair of my country. There is too
I much intelligence, virtue and patriotism
in the American people, for tho rule of
passion and revenge to continue always.
The growth, prosperity and happiness of
one section of this great Republic is most
intimately blended with and dependent
on that of tho other.' Liko tho limbs of
the human body, when one is broken,
paralyzed or injured, it must affect the
whole 83Tstem. -This truth will soon be
seen and felt at the North. I am, with
groat respect, yours, &c,

Washington, Dec. 4.
In tho Senate, Mr. Sumnor gave notice

lutions declaring the power of Congress
on tho subject of reconstruction and the
right to excludo tho lato rebellious States

a resolution, which was adopted, insisting
on tho adoption of tho constitutional
amendment, beforo the House will con?
sider the propriety of giving the Sonthern
States representation.

nies the truth of a telegram, circulating

resolution for the appointment of a Com?
mittee of Five, to reporc to tho Houso at

in rebellion, tho amount of money ex?
pended by the United States in construct?
ing, repairing, equipping and managing
such roads, the amount now due by each
of them to the Government, &c; also, as
to the proper course to be taken by tho
Government in relation to said railroads.

ganization over tho States recently in re?
bellion. The Judiciary Committee havo
reported against re pealing so much of tho
confiscation Act as prohibits the forleituro
of the real estate of the delinquents be?
yond the term of their natural lives. They
say that to forfeit altogether the property
of those engaged in the lato rebellion,
would be theenactment of an ex post facto
law within tho meaning of the constitu?
tional interdict, by annexing to a crime
already committed a new and additional
punishment.

ing power, which called for an emphatic

-
The President's Message.
"We lay beforo our readers this morning
the President's message. Those who
have been taught to believe that it would
contain recommendations for startling and
dangerous amendments of the Federal
Constitution, anthoffers of concessions and
compromises to the triumphant enemies
of his administration, will find that they
have been deceived.
As a state paper it is singularly free
from those multitudinous recommenda?
tions which not unfrequently disfigure
and weaken tho effect of such produc?
tions. The message is able, concise, clear
and exceedingly well written. Its tone
is at once temperate and firm. If it con?
cedes nothing to the demands of the
"wild beasts Of Ephesus," neither does it
exasperate them Dy untimely denuncia?
tion. Indeed^ tho President's messages
are as free from exasperating expletives
as his speeches are full of them. There
is not a word, phrase, sentenco or para?
graph in tho message to offend the most
fastidious. And yet, that portion of it
which is devoted to the question of recon?
struction is, from the force and cloarness
of its statements and logic, one of the
most crushing exposures of the inconsis?
tencies and tergiversations of tho Radi?
cals which has yet appeared. It demon?
strates that the policy of Congress is at
this time the only obstacle in the way of
the complete restoration of the Union.
It shows that everything for which the
North went to war has boen accomplish?
ed. In tho very incipiency of tho con?
test, before tho first great foot-raco at
"Bull Run," Congress declared that the
war was waged, not to deprive tho "re?
bellious States" of their rignts, but pure?
ly and simply to restore tue authority of
tho Constitution and lawB of tho United
States.
That result has boen achieved. In tho
Southern States, nobody now disputes
tho authority of tho Federal laws and
Constitution. Although denied represen?
tation, wo nevertheless pay tho tax gath?
er his dues. Although wo are pinched
by poverty and hungor, yet unguarded
Post-offices, Custom houses, Federal
Courts, Treasury agencies, Internal Rev
on uo offices everywhero illustrate tho su?
premacy of the law. Tho whole ma?
chinery of the Government is in peacea?
ble operation in the Southern States.
Ordor and peaco everywhere exist
although military rulo has longsinco been
replaced by civil authority. No people,
as the President shows with crushing
force, ever accepted tho result of tho ar?
bitrament of battle more quietly than we
have done, and never was there less ex?
cuse fcr lawless outrages upon a people
than for those of which wo havo been
made the victims. Allot this is set forth
with extraordinary force by the Presi?
dent, and although it may make no
impression upon tho insensate revolution?
ists to whom his message is addressed,
the presentation of the case is neverthe?
less powerful and convincing.
It will be perceived by tho readers of
tho message that after twelve months' of
bittor and merciless denunciation the
President is found, so far as the question
of reconstruction is concerned, standing
precisely whero ho was in December last.
Ho still affirms that the admission into
Congress of representatives from the
Southern States is the only thing which
is now essential for the complete restora?
tion of tho Union, and that when Con?
gress ceases to bo faithless to its duty,
the work of reunion will be complete.
As this is the sincere and honest convic?
tion of tho President, and as he believes
that this, and only this, will accomplish
the desired result, he refrains from all
suggestions of compromises which fall
short of the true duty of Congress.
As long as representation is denied he
holds Congress responsible for all th3 ills,
perils and misfortunes which environ the
country.
To the "amendments" to the Constitu?
tion passed by Congress he concedes no
merit, leaving the advocacy of all such
quack nostrums to that class of time
serving ingrates who havo neither sense,
gratitude nor sectional pride. From the
tenor of tho President's message, it is ob?
vious that so monstrous and flagitious an
outrage and violation of the Constitution
does he regard this denial of representa?
tion to ten States, that it presents good
ground for the refusal of the unrepresent?
ed section to pay any portion of the in?
ternal revenue tax. which is only Isgaily
collected in tho represented States. And
it is sincerely to be hoped that a case
may very speedily bo made for the decis?
ion of the Supreme Court, which will test
the question in its most important aspect.
In aomo respef tbo Aiessage of the
President conveys very gratifying infor?
mation ???> tho nation. Although, through
2tad?*ri extravagance, the expenditure
r<r the Government in time of peaco ex?
ceed ?300,000,000, yet the National debt
has been considerably diminished. The
foreign complications and diplomatic is?
sues, which are referred to in tho Mossa^e,
are important, but they do not threaten,
as was ?'anticipated, any rupture of our
pacific relations with either France or
England.?&tf&ovd T\rm. j
A Cheerful View.
Tho Bichmond Times, referring to tho
belief umong many that the future of
that State ia destined to become brighter
than the present, cheerfully remarks as
follows:
We sincerely hope that the encoura?
ging peep which these gentlemen seem to
have load behind the curtain of futurity
has disclosed sights and events which,
when they come within the range of oth?
er men's eyes, will confirm their impres?
sions and predictions. We are not given
to despondency, and we swallow with
joyous avidity any hopes which art
thrown to ub from any quarter. We be?
lieve in hope?we look upon it as the poet
did.
?Hope ! of all the ills that men endure,
The only ohaap and universal eure.
Thou captiv's freedom and thou sick man's health;
Thou lover's victory and thou beggar's vrealth 1"
There is a vitality in hope which ii
hard to destroy. The Radicals cannot
"confiscate" it, nor can they exclude it
from our hearts by a constitutional
amendment. We are very rich in hope,
and we can increase our wealth in . this
respect whenever we please. And the
most hopeful sign which we have seen is
the fact that so many of our best politi?
cians are turning their attention to agri?
culture, which is tho only lever after all
that can lift us out of tho pit of woe and
misfortune into which we nave been cast
by the unsuccessful results of our. at?
tempts to exorcise the right of self-gov?
eminent.
It is a subject of congratulation that so
many of our lato soldiers and statesmon
are imitating Cinoinnatus?not through
choice, perhaps, but from constraint of
circumstances. But so their zeal, energy,
talents and examples aro secured, no mat?
ter how, in developing the most important
of all the natural resources of a State,
the desired result will be accomplished.
What we want now is the creation and
accumulation of wealth, and tho speedi?
est and surest way to get it will be to
dig and plow the earth. Monoy is said
to bo "the root of all evil," but the want
of tho "root" is working more evil in this
commonwealth than the possession of it
would do.
Most of the indignity, persecution and
oppression which we now receive at the
hands of the ruling faction of the North
arise because of our present poverty and
helplessness. We aro like poor relations,
objects to be snubbed and put upon. But
lot us onco begin to be prosperous ; let it
bo generally known that wo are getting
rich, that we have "corn for sale," and
straightway our friends will become as
locusts, and their affection will bo most
touching. If we shall then be indifferent
about taking our seats in Congress, they
will be ready to drag us in by force.
It is a prodigious thing to have money;
it is "treason" to be poor. Wealth adds
to a man's rospectabilily and "loyalty
poverty keeps him out of his seat in Con?
gress and proves conclusively that he is a
"rebel." The way to get justice and'
power and friends is to get rich, and we
can do so through the aid of agriculturo,
because our staple products are worth
now more than they ever wore before;
Every man who has a field has a gold
mine?let him dig it. Politics pay notb-,
ing at present, and it is hoped that every
politician will bocome a plowman ; and if
that does not suit him let him turn wood
sawyer and chop sticks, instead of logic.
When we have retrieved our fortunes,,
then we will try and set the country to
rights; meantime, let the Radicals run
their machine to Hades if they wish it.
