The electric fanmakers have formed
a combine to raise prices. People in
the prairie states do not need to worry
about it for some months, as nature
will furnish the breeze required.
A get-rich-quick operator in Brook­
lyn paid $52,260 in dividends and van­
ished with $600,000 of depositors'
money. The assets consist of several
desks and a second-hand carpet.
A man has been discovered who can
walk only when he is asleep. Profes­
sional tramps will be distressed to hear
that they may wake up and find them­
selves engaged in doing something use­
ful.
Nearly all the contracts for the new
palace to be built for the crown prince
of Japan will be let to American firms.
The architect is an American, and he
agrees that the structure"shall be earth­
quake proof.
The latest thing in Jrcphy!actics is
the discovery of what is termed a "vac­
cine" for typhoid fever. Just what a
cow has to do with typhoid germs is
not clear, but the material, whatever it
?s, has been tried in the British army
in Burmah with results which are re­
ported to be satisfactory.
The new woman surely is enterpris­
ing. She isn't satisfied with old meth­
ods—not for a minute. One of them
in Indiana has been stealing farm prod­
uce by the wagon load, and if she hadn't
been caught just when she was there
is every likelihood that she would have
gotten away with a barn or a granary.
Garret A. Hobart was the sixth vice
president of the United States to die in
office. The others were George Clinton,
of New York, in 1812 Elbridge Gerry,
of Massachusetts, in 1814 William
King, of Alabama, in 1853 Henry Wil­
son, of Massachusetts, in 1875, and
Thomas A. Hendricks, of Indiana, in
1885.
Steven E. Burch, who got a job as a
hired band on the farm of Peter Green
wait, near Huron, Kan., and then eloped
with the farmer's comely daughter,
turns out' to be a young Missourian of
wealth and social prominence, and
and chose this means of finding just
the wife he wanted. He has written
to his new father-in-law saying that
his search was along one, but has been
amply rewarded.
Frank D. Randall, a well-known civil
engineer in Kansas City, has discovered
in the grand canyon of the Colorado
what he claims will prove the richest
copper mines in the world. In addition
to the vast deposits of virgin copper
he saw immense outeroppings of gold
incrusted rock and masses of schist
with garnets sticking out like plums
in a pudding, veins of coal and asbestos,
mica, walls of onyx, columns of serpen­
tine.
"I have seen thousands of persons die
under all sorts of circumstances, and
never yet have I seen one display the
slightest fear of death." This remark­
able statement was made by a physician
who has practiced many years in Phil­
adelphia, and who has seen a great deal
of hospital service. "It is a popular fal­
lacy," he went on, "to imagine that a
deathbed scene is ever terrible, other
than as a parting between loved ones.
The fear of the unknown is never pres­
ent at the last."
In June n£xt. it will be 500 years since
the birth of Johann Gutenberg, who
invented the art of printing with mov­
able type. It is not, as a matter of fact,
exactly known when he was born, but
for the sake of convenience it is as­
sumed that the interesting event oc­
curred in June, 1400. That he was
born in the German city of Mayence,
on the Rhine, is not disputed, and in
that city the fifth century of his birth
will be celebrated next year by an in­
ternational printing rxhibition.
A granite shaft 70 feet high is to be
erected at Erie, Pa., to the memory of
Capt. Gridley, of the cruiser Olympia,
who died a short time after the battle
of Manila bay. There will be a bust and
bronze tablets, and, with othel* inscrip­
tions, Dewey's famous words: "You
may fire, Gridley, when you are ready."
In the meantime, Gridley's family is
reported to be in very poor circum­
stances. It might be a better monu­
ment of our appreciation of the hero if
we took care of his family first and built
the monument afterward.
The fact that 57 new cotton mills
have been built in the south during the
last 1? months and the probability that
as many more will be erected during
the coming 12 months marks an ex­
traordinary epoch in the industrial and
commercial history of the south. Such
an epoch can only be described by em­
ploying the superlatives of speech. The
effect of the movement that is produc­
ing such a result will be felt all over the
world. In the south it will change the
whole aspect of affairs. It will give
rise to new deals, new ambitions and
new ideals.
The nose is playing an important part
in both real and mimic life nowadays.
Having been a prominent feature in
fact, having been the center of attrac­
tion on the stage—it is now coming to
the front more conspicuously than be­
fore in other ways. A New York man
who had the misfortune to lose his nose
and who contracted with a dental op­
erator for a falsft one is wrathy because
the false nose pes not fit, and he
threatens suit i-a his montfy is not re­
turned or a new aVid better fitting nose
is not furnished him. And who can
blame him?
Lillie Devereux Blake made public a
statement that women are eligible to
appointment as enumerators and as
clerks in the compilation of the census
of 1900, as they were in the census of
1880 and of 1890. She does this in the
belief that women generally tjre igno­
rant of the law in this matter and in the
nope' that a great many more applica­
tions will be made when the facts are
generally known. And in this she Is
right, no doubt. What a rare oppor­
tunity it will give women enumerators
to learn,
the ages of all the other women
in their district!

berley are making thq advance of
Gen. Methuen very difficult.
Expectation of catching Aguinaldo in
the north has been practically aban­
doned, and the probability now is that
he will turn southward, if he is not al­
ready there, with his destination Cavite
province, his home, where the insur­
rection began and where it still has its
greatest strength. Gen. Young has ar­
rived at Vigan, after a hard but success­
ful fight with a greatly superior force
of Filipinos, in which the Americans
had one killed and 12 wounded. The.
enemy's loss was heavy.

It is reported that serious dissen­
sions have broken out in the Boer camp

Proceedings in the Roberts Case
Are to Be No Longer!
in Secret
THE ACCUSED MAN PLEADS DOT GUILTY.
--y
Defends His Cme Before House In­
vestigating Committee Offers
Four Reasons Why Committee Has
No Jurisdiction in Case—Argues
for Two Honrs.
Washington, Dec. 11.—The considera­
tion of the case of Mr. Roberts, of Utah,
was resumed at ten o'clock in the morn­
ing by the house investigating commit­
tee, ,Mr. Roberts being present to plead
to certain specific interrogatories
which had been framed. The proceed­
ings continued to be behind closed
doors. Mr. Roberts was first asked if
he conceded the existence of the court
record wherein he pleaded guilty, in
1889 under the Edmunds-Tucker law.
This he conceded. He was next asked
whether about 1887 or since 1890, he
had married plural wives and had lived
with them since that time as wives.,.
Roberta Pleads Not Guilty.
To the whole of this charge Roberts
pleaded not guilty, and then demurred
to the jurisdiction of the committee for
the following reasons:
"First—On the ground of violation of
constitutional rights In that it attempted
to try him for a crime without presentment
of indictment by grand jury, and without
trial before a jury and due process of
law.
"Second—That it was an attempt to de­
prive him of vested property that he held
fn the emoluments of an office for the
full term.
"Third—That the only evidence that
eould be rightfully considered in the com­
mittee was a court record establishing the
guilt, confessed or proven, of the repre­
sentative-elect and that the committee
has no right to consider any other evi­
dence.
"Fourth—That the crime alleged—name­
ly, that of unlawful cohabitation—even if
proven would not constitute a sufficient
crime to bar a member or deprive him of
his seat, because Innocence of polygamy
or unlawful cohabitation is nowhere
enumerated in the constitution as a quali­
fication for the office of member of con­
gress, nor is it named in any United States
law applicable to Utah or any other state."
Legal Controversy TUronishont.
Mr. Roberts argued these points for
nearly two hours, referring to law
books and answering queries. It was
a
legal controversy throughout, the
facts not being gone into at length.
Mr. Roberts concluded by asking that
his primal facie right to a seat be at
once considered, as the present status
denied to a sovereign state representa­
tion in the house at a time when in­
jurious legislation affecting that state
might take place..
Pnblic Sessions Hereafter.
At the conclusion of Mr. Roberts'
statement the committee held an exec­
utive session and then adjourned until
two p. m. The chairman announced
that subsequent meetings would be
open and publicity also was given to the
official stenographer's reports of the
morning session.
A Sensation.
At the afternoon session of the Rob­
erts investigating committee, Mr. Rob­
erts created a sensation by denouncing
A. T. Schroeder, one of the gentile dele­
gation from Utah. Mr. Schroeder was
about to address the committee, when
Roberts, waving his hand in protest,
said:
"I object. I object to this witness if he
comes here as an attorney. I object to
him if he comes as a witness, on the ground
that he is unworthy of confidence and be­
cause he is a common swindler. And I
propose to establish by the records of the
supreme court of Utah that he is utterly
unworthy of belief.".
After some explanations, Mr.
Schroeder was permitted to proceed.
Defends Department Stores.
Washington, Dec. 11. Hon. John
Wanamaker Saturday testified before
the industrial commission on the sub­
ject of department stores. He claimed
these stores were beneficial to society,
having a substantial economic and mor­
al basis for their existence. "It is," he
continued, "a natural product evolved
from conditions that exist as a result of
fixed trade laws. Cheaper capital, bet­
ter transportation, more rapid com­
munication make the modern retail
store possible, natural and useful,
therefore inevitable."
Indians Employ an Illinois Han.
Tahlequah, I. T., Dec.
11. The Cher­
okee legislature has passed an act em­
ploying Judge William M. Springer, of
Illinois, as resident attorney for the
Cherokees at Washington for one year.
An act was also passed authorizing a
delegation of four persons, two of
whom must be full-blooded, to go to
Washington in the interest of the Cher­
okee nation.
Dnlce of Manchester Sick.
New York, Dec. 11.—The duke of
Manchester, who is confined to his
rooms in the Waldorf-Astoria with a
severe attack of nervous prostration,
will be unable to sail for England Sat­
urday as he had planned. The cable­
gram received a few days ago sum­
moning the duke home to his sister's
deathbed completely prostrated him.
Quarantine Against Texan Fever.
Washington, Dec. 11.—The usual an­
nual quarantine order against the area
where the splenetic or southern (Tex­
as) fever exists among cattle will be
issued shortly by the department of
agriculture, to take effect January 1.
The order will be substantially like
that of last year.
Return Another Indictment.
Lansing, Mich., Dec. 11.—The grand
jury returned another indictment at
11 o'clock and adjourned until Mon­
day. The name of the person indicted
is suppressed, but it is surmised that
the respondent is a former state offi­
cial.
I Its Origin.
"Hoot!" cried the owl ever and anon.
The fowls of the air and the beasts of the
field stirred uneasily in their sleep and mut­
tered maledictions.
"Why1 are they so angry?" asked the owlet
at last.
"They are envious, my child," replied the
owl, "of my Scotch dialect. Hoot, hoot!"—

THE "OPEN DOOR" IN CHINA,
Decision of Powers to Maintain This
Policy Very Gratifying to
j. United States.
Washington, Dec. 11.—The various
publications coming from European
sources, touching the decision of the
powers to meet the United States' re­
quest for a formal written undertaking
to maintain the "open door" in China,
are giving satisfaction to the officials
here as indicating the success of this
important diplomatic.' negotiation.
However, it may be stated the responses
of the European governments have not
yet reached the state department. It
is realized thoroughly that in a matter
of this importance the negotiation
must be conducted with the greatest,
circumspection and deliberation.
Hence it is no matter for surprise that
the responses have not yet been re­
ceived. It is hoped that the final suc­
cess of the negotiations can be com­
municated to congress in the shape of
a special message from the president,
accompanied by an explanatory state­
ment from Secretary Hay, soon after
the holidays.
London, Dec. 11.—The Berlin corre­
spondent of the Standard says: All the
powers concerned have favorably re­
ceived the proposals of the United
States regarding the maintenance of
the "open door" in China, each offer­
ing to sign the desired assurance if the
others will do so.
ATTACK AGUINALDO'S GUARD.
Dispatches from Gen. Otis Indicates
That Americans Are Pressing
Filipino Leader Very Hard.
Washington, Dec. 11.—The war de­
partment has received the following
from Gen. Otis:
"Manila, Dec. 9.—Dispatch from Young
at Vigan .yesterday says escaped Spanish
prisoners report four hours' engagement
3d inst. between his troops and Aguinal­
do's guard near Cervantes, 50 miles south­
east of Vigan, with heavy loss to enemy,
who is being pursued. Our loss one killed
six wounded inhabitants of own accord
join troops repairing trail and carrying
subsistence. Have pushed column to San
Jose south Bangued, Howse's column on
rear trail Batchelor's battalion Twenty
fourth out of reach north of Bayonbong,
evidently descending river. Natives re­
port fighting occurred 20 miles north.
Navy reaches Aparri to-morrow column
of MacArthur's troops Twenty-fifth in­
fantry reported near Iba west coast Zam
bales Grant's column near Subig bay
Lawton in Bulucan province to-day with
sufficient troops to overcome opposition
and scatter enemy."
It-is probable that the troops which
engaged Aguinaldo's guard are Hare's
command, as he was reported to be
close in the insurgent leader's rear.
Gen. Otis also cables as follows re­
garding the revolt in Negros:
"Information received that Negros re­
volt of minor importance Byrnes in rapid
pursuit of disaffected party Hughes in
mountains Panay en route Capiz."
Will Ask Congress for Protection.
Los Angeles, Cal., Dec. 11. Owing
to the possible infection of fruit or­
chards by the importations from other
states or foreign countries of fruit
trees infected with worms, scale or
other parasites, the Association of Hor­
ticultural Commissioners of southern
California has drafted a bill to be sub­
mitted to congress. It proposes to es­
tablish a national quarantine law
against infected nursery stock of all
kinds imported from foreign countries,
and containing other provisions of sim­
ilar nature to operate as an interstate
law against such pests.
Orders Pay Stopped.
Washington, Dec. 11. One of the re­
sults of the investigations made in the
case of the troopship Tartar is the stop­
page of the pay of Maj. John A. Rafter,
surgeon, Twentieth Kansas volunteers.
This action was taken at t^e request of
Gen. Shafter and was seconded by Sec­
retary Root. Gen. Shafter, who has di­
rection of the inquiry, suggested that
the pay in Surgeon Rafter's case be
suspended until certain accounts for
the provisioning of sick soldiers on
board the transport are settled.
Will Reconstruct Isthmus Railroad.
London, Dec. 11. The Westminster
Gazette says Sir Weetman Dickinson
Pearson, M. P., for Colchester and head
of the firm of S. Pearson & Son, limited,
contractors for public works, has com­
pleted negotiations with the Mexican
government to take over the Isthmus
of Tehauntepec railroad on a 50 years'
lease. It is said that he will recon­
struct, the railroad and construct a har­
bor at either end. The harbors are to
cost $10,000,000.
British Delegates Arrive.
Detroit, Mich., Dec. 11.—James Has
lam and Alexander Wilkie, fraternal
delegates from the British Trades
Union congress to the American Fed­
eration of Labor, arrived. A letter
from President Gompers was received
by Secretary Morrison, which states

Costly Fire.
Washington, Dec. 11.—Early Satur­
day fire totally destroyed the Welling
mansion, at Fourteenth street and
Welling Place, this city. The loss on
the residence was $60,000, and on the
contents about $50,000. Dr. L. H.
French occupied the residence and,
with his servants, escaped from the
building just as the roof fell in.
Big Contract for Mules.
St. Louis, Dec. 11.—Capt. Marshall,
an officer in the British army, has
closed a contract with a local firm for
1,000 Missouri mules, to be used in
South Africa. It is expected that
other contracts may be let within a
short time for 10,000 more animals.

W1
Certificate Issued by Election Com­
missioners Makes Him Gov­
ernor of Kentucky.
HIS PLURALITY IS PLACED AT 2,383.
No Demonstration or Excitement
When Finding of the Beard Is
Made Public—Commissioner Parali
Presented a Minority Oplsli
Opinions Filed In Supreme Court.
Frankfort, Ky., Dec. 11.—At 9:45 in
the morning the election certificate of
William S. Taylor was signed by the
election commissioners and he was de­
clared to be governor-elect of Ken­
tucky. The official figures of the vote
filed with the secretary of state Finley
are:
Taylor, 193,714 Goebel, 191,331. Tay­
lor's plurality, 2,383.
The operation, which ended, for the
time being at least, the bitterly fought
gubernatorial contest, was conducted
in the simplest manner. The majority
opinion of Commissioners Pryor and
Ellis and the minority opinion of Com­
missioner Poyntz were not read as was
the original intention. The three com­
missioners walked first to the office of
the clerk of the state supreme court,
where they filed two opinions. They
then passed into the office of the secre­
tary of state. Clerk Chenault, of the
board of commissioners, read the fig­
ures, showing that the republican can­
didates for offices on the state ticket
had received the largest number of
votes, and then certificates of election
were signed at once, that of Mr. Taylor
being first on the list.
No Demonstration.
There were only 14 people in the room
at the time, and of this number only
two were there as idle spectators.
There was no crowd around the build­
ing and no interest was manifested in
the work save by those engaged in it,
and those who stood looking on. The
three commissioners were all apparent­
ly in good humor, although Commis­
sioners Ellis and Pryor, who had done
the most work in preparing their long
and elaborate opinion, looked worn and
tired. The certificates, as soon as
signed, were filed with the secretary
of state and commissions will be issued
to the elected men at once by Gov. Brad­
ley.
Commissioner Ellis Talks.
Late at night, when the decision had
gone forth to the public, Commissioner
Ellis, upon whose shoulders the great­
est part of the work of the preparing
of the opinion has fallen, discussed the
matter freely.
"This has been a hard thing for me,"
he said, his eyes inflamed by loss of sleep
and the heavy lines in his face bearing elo­
quent witness to the truth of his statement.
"It has been a hard thing for all of us.
I wish, however, that all of the people of
the county should know how nobly Judge
Pryor. has acted in this matter and how
conscientiously he has done what he con­
sidered his duty. He is a great man: one
of the greatest, in my opinion, that Ken­
tucky has ever produced, and I am sure
his conduct in this case has been another
piece of his long and honorable career as
a public officer.
"Speaking for myself," continued Mr.
Ellis, "I say frankly I did not like to do
this thing, but under the law and the evi­
dence there is nothing else I can do and be
an honest man.
"Why. I was an original Goebel man. 1
was a Goebel man long before he received
the nomination, and I am a Goebel man
now. I can go beyond that and say I am
a Goebel partisan. I have always been
a partisan in politics, a rank partisan, and
it would give me greater pleasure than
I can express to be able to declare for
the democrats in this thing, but I can't do
it. The proceedings before the board were
so overwhelmingly in favor of the repub­
licans and they had so much the best of
the arguments that it is almost idle to
discuss the affair. There was, to the
minds of Judge Pryor and myself, only
one thing to do, and that we have done.
I know there are plenty of men who think
that, strong democratic partisan as I have
been, I should have remained a democratic
partisan and voted otherwise. How can
I do that? How can I commit such a rape
on my reputation and conscience as that?
"Viewed from the legal standpoint, which
in things like this is the only standpoint, I
have done what my conscience and my
long career as a lawyer tell me is right,
and 1 will do otherwise for no man or upon
any consideration."
Goebel Seems Satisfied.
The statements made by Mr. Ellis
have been upheld by his conduct from
first to last throughout the canvass.
He did all of the questioning of the at­
torneys and seemed at every stage to
be most anxious to obtain the truth and
be impartial to both sides. Mr. Goebel
was apparently in the best of humor
after being told that Mr. Taylor's cer­
tificate had been signed. He laughed
and shook his head when asked if he
had anything to say.
"Not a thing I am not talking."
"When will you make a contest?"
"1 have not decided yet, and I, of course,
cannot discuss it when I do not know it
myself."
The defeated candidate was game to
the last, and if there was any ill humor
in him nobody knew it but himself.
Mr. Taylor was modest and reticent, as
usual.
"I expected it, of course," he said. "I
knew that If the commissioners went by
the law and the evidence they could do
nothing Use than decide the way they
have done."
Poyntz Refnses to Sign.
Commissioner Poyntz declined to
sign the republican certificates of elec­
tion, saying that be stood by the opin­
ion he had rendered and could not con­
sistently do so. He consented to sign
the certificates of the railroad commis­
sioners, however.
CharKed with Embculcnent.
St. Louis, Ilec. 11.—T. Newton Ed­
wards, who was postmaster at Law
renceburg, Ky., has been arrested by
a deputy United States marshal at
Monroe City, Mo., and brought here.
He is charged with embezzling sev­
eral hundred dollars while postmaster.
Judge Adams, of the United States
court, ordered that Edwards be taken

They had been sitting together for half
an hour.
"I have enjoyed our conversation so
much!" she exclaimed, as she rose to go.

WAS LOG AH MURDERED?

with Treneheronsly.
San Francisco,Dec. 11.—If stories told
by those who returned on the transport
Sheridan, which carried the Thirty
third infantry to the Philippines, are
true, Maj. John A. J.o£an. Jr.. may not
have met his death at the hands of Fili­
pino sharpshooters, as cable stories
have reported. According^ to the state­
ment of Georfre H. Kappitz, the purser
of the Sheridan, supported by others of
the crew of the transport, Logan was
shot by some of bis own men. Purser
Kappitz was disinclined to go into par­
ticulars regarding the yonng major's
taking off, but on being pressed to ex­
plain some of the circumstances, he
said:
"Maj. Logan made himself particularly
offensive to the men by his overbearing
manner toward those under him. and this
feeling was heightened by an incident
which occurred one day out at sea. Maj.
Logan had a pet dog to which he iras very
much attached. One of the soldiers alsc
had a dog which was looked upon as a sort
of mascot among the men. It happened
that the two dogs got into a fight and Lo
gan's dog came out of the scrimmage the 1
worse for the encounter. Logan was so an- I
gered that he seized the soldier's dog and
threw him overboard. This action only
served to make the feeling more bitter
against the officer and a threat was openly
made and repeated many times that Lo
gan would not last after the first battle."
The fact is pointed out by the men
who returned on the Sheridan that the
cable accounts of just how Maj. Logan
received the wound in battle at San
Fabian are rather vague, and they think
this is significant.
Big Ore Shipments.
Philadelphia, Dec. 11.—It is estimat­
ed that over 200 ships will be required
to bring the cargoes of iron and cop­
per ore consigned to this port for the
coming year. Purchases of 200,000
tons of iron ore have been made in
Spain and other Mediterranean conn
tries for shipment to Philadelphia, be­
sides what has been contracted for
from the Daiquiri. Juragtia and
Chirivico mines in Cuba.
Miners on Strike.
Oakland, Cal., Dec. 11.—Two hundred
miners are on strike at the Tesla mines
because of a dispute with the superin­
tendent over the wages paid. Their
grievance rests upon a demand from
the mine bosses that the regular men
shall accept 60 cents a cubic yard in­
stead of 85 cents, the rate that has
been in effect to men not hired by sub­
contractors.
Italian Faster Cnmasked.
Rio Janeiro, Dec. 11.—Succi. the fa­
mous Italian faster, has been un­
masked here. Dr. Daniel Almeida has
discovered that he used fibrous meat
compressed into the smallest size, and
this, with a small quantity of mineral
water, was enough to prevent starr»
tion.
BleyellKt Killed.
Atlantic City, N. J., Dec. 11.—Albert,
the 17-year-old son of Hon. John
Gardner, representative from the Sec­
ond New Jersey district In congress,
was ran down and instantly killed at
Egg Harbor city, by an express train
while riding his bicycle.
Again Rewarded.
London, Dec. 11.—Michael J. Samp­
son, the alleged forger, who was ar­
rested November 23, near Limerick, at
the request of the chief detective of
Chicago, 111., was again remanded in
the Bow street police court until De­
cember 16.
Rnsslan Company CralnK.
St. Petersburg, Dec. 11.—The official

Moscow Insurance company has re­
ceived permission to operate abroad
and intends to operate in the United
States.

A horseman burst into the prison yard.
"Reprieved!" be shouted, and waved a

"No: but he has eaten the hearty break­
fast of ham and eggs, coffee and potatoes!"
