A Glory To Milan.
The following fron the Milan, (Tenti.)
Hustler will be f interest to our readers
Messrs. Todd & Roper are well kno wn
in this city.
Manufacturers make towns.
Realizing this important fact the peo
ple of Mdan eight years since awoke
from thMr lethargy ; t'lefms of progres
sion were kindled; activity and energy
took the plice of stands' illisra and
among other enterprises the sho k man
ufacturing firm of T dd & Roper was in
jured to loeat among on.
It was a red le terday for Milan.
Born hustlers they erected handsome
and commodious buildings, put in the
latest improved machinery and brought
their large f rce of skilled and unskilled
. lab r t form a thiiving industry.
Their succes ha been assured from
the s'art and six days in the week the
factory whistlo has sounded and its
tones awakening the eclios for miles
iround informed the people that work
was its motto.
The enterprise not only gives employ
ment to a large number of regularly
employed hands, but score of men are
on its pay roll funnelling the enormous
amount of timber req tired.
When Mes-rs. Todd & Roper realized
that the state of Tenncs ce would not be
represented at the ereat world's fair
knowing the great benefit to be derived
from an exhibit they prepared the fol
lowing :
One molasses hogshead, one rum hog
head, one honey case, one honey shook,
ono molasses shook, one rum shook, one
pair ruin heads, one pair beer half bar
rel heads, twenty-five red oak staves for
molas-es, twenty five white oak staves
for beer kegs, twenty five rough staves
in the condition they came from the
tree.
The exhibit was given 'a prominent
position in the Fores'ry building and
not only advertise I the enterprising ex
hibitors but likewise Mi'an.
Great was their reward.
Side byside with the famed cooperage
world they triumphantly marched away
with the greatest honor to bo attained -a
gold medal for excellence in timber
and preparation.
Great u the firm of Todd & Roper.
The Hustler tips i's tile to them.
No belter preparation for the hair has

Its reputation is world-wide.
JGr. Dr. Heecher's Sentiments.
, Df . A. M. Boocher, a woman physician
of Newton ville, Mass., is a consin of
Henry Ward Beecher, and has the typ
ical Beecher face and, it may be added,
tho typical Beocher straightforwardness.
Recently before a club, in the course of
m address, Dr. Beecher creatod a decid
ed sensation by putting herself on rec
ord with the opinion: "No woman who
Sas jLhe spirit or instinct of motherhood
tan fail to mother something. Better a
-get dog than nothing at all."
THE MtbbAGE.
1'rmlttant Cleveland Sent Ik to CongreM
Monday.
WasnmaTON, Dec. 5. President Cleve
land's mesbuue was Kiven to congress Mon
day. Jn its full ttiit it is very long, but
the greater part is devoted to a review of
the reports of the various departments.
There is nothing radical or sensational in
the message, the Hawaiian matter bein
but briefly touched upon, and the recom
mendations on the tariff question being in
line with the president's well known
views.
After showing that we are at pence with
foreign powers, and disposing briefly of
sucli diplomatic negotiations as have been
consummated or under way, he refers 10
the steps taken in regard to tee lieary law,
the arbitration over the Bering sen seiz
ures, the discrimination in (anal tolls,
troubles in the South American republics,
urges that the Nicaragua canal he com
pleted under American auspices, tl e latent
Nimoan difficulty, the trouble with S ain
over the outrages on our missionaries' in
the Caroline islands, and with Turkey, etc.
J le then takes tip the Hawaiian matter
and, after recounting the fucts already
known, nnd the net ion of the administra
tion thus fur, he says:
Upon the facts developed it seemed to
me the only honorable- course for our gov
ernment to pursue was to undo the wrong
that hud Usui done by these representin
us and to restore us far as practicable the
status existing at the time of our forcible
intervention. With a view of aocomplisii
ing this result within the constitutional
limits of executive power und recognizing
all our obligations and responsibilities
frrowing out of any chunged conditions
rought about by our unjustifiable inter
ference our present minister-at Honolulu
has received appropriate instructions to
the accomplishment of any deiinite results
has been received from him. Additional
advices are soon expected. When received
they will be promptly sent to the congress
together with all other information ut
hand, accompanied by a special execrttivo
message fully detailing all the facts neces
sary to a complete understanding of the
case and presenting a history of all the
material events leading up the present
situation.
Aftur briefly giving a condensation of
the report of the secretary of the treasury,
he says:
The recent repeal of the provision of law
requiring the purchase of silver bullion by
the govern meat as a feature of our mone
tary fciiemo. has made an entire change in
the complexion of onr currency a flairs. I
do not doubt that the ultimate result of
this action will be most salutary and far
reaching.
The reports of the secretaries of navy,
war and interior, the attorney general and
the j lost master general, already made pub
lic, are given in condensed form. Of the
postmaster general's report, he says:
He concurs with the recommendations
of the secretary of the interior in regard to
the treatment of the Indians, the disposal
of public lands and upon forestry.
After devoting considerable space to the
report of the secretary of agriculture, and
the subject of pensions, he then took up
civil service reform:
I am, if jHissible, more thau ever con
vinced of the incalculable benefits con
ferred by the civil service law, not only in
its etfect uixtn the public service, but also,
what is even more important, in its effect
in elevating the tone of political life gen
erally. The course of civil service in thi
country, instructively and interestingly,
illustrates how strong a hold a movement
gains upon every people which has under
lying it a sentiment of justice and right,
and which at the same tune promises bet
ter administration of their government.
The law embodying this reform found
its way to our statute book more from feat
of the populur sentiment existing in it
favor than from any love for the reform
itself on the part of the legislators; ami it
has lived and grown and flourished in 8pite
of the covert aa well as open hostility ol
spoilsmen, and notwithstanding the
querulous impracticability of many self
constituted guardians.
The president then di.-cusses the tariff
question in all its phases, iin'd in conclusion
says:
My intense feeling of responsibility im
pels me to invoke for the manifest inter
ests of a generous and confiding people the
most scrupulous care and to pledge my
willing support to every legislative effort
for the advancement of the greatness and
prosperity our beloved count ry.

Do not fail to take advantage of tho

Music is notorious for narrowing one's

practice with literary work as well. As
to your practice, we would give you this
maxim: "Tho essential thing in practice
is to see exactly what is to be done in all
its details and then do it again and
again with tiie greatest clearness, pre
cision aud energy." When you take up a
new piece, notice the key, the harmonies,
chords, scales, fingering and general ef

centration. Develop self criticism. "The
thing you cannot do is the very thing
you should make yourself do." In prac
