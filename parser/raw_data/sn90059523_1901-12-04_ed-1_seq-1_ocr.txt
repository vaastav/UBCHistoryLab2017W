WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—President
Roosevelt's, first message was read to
both houses of congress today, and was
listened to with rapt attention.- The
message was unusually long, and over
two hours; were consumed in tha read
ing. It is as follows:
To the Senate and House of Representa
tives:
The congress assembles this year under
the shadow of. a great calamity. On the
""th of September President McKinley was
shot by an anarchist while attending the
American exposition at tfunraio and
died in that city on the 11th of .that
month. ' .:
I of the last seven elected presidents he is
the third who has been murdered, and the
bare recital of this fact is sufficient to
"justify grave alarm among all loyal
American citizens. Moreover, the circum
stances of this, the third assassination of
an American president, have a peculiarly
sinister significance. . Both President lAn
' coin- and President Garfield were killed by
assassins of types unfortunately not un
common in history, President Lincoln
tailing a * victim to the terrible passions
aroused by four years of civil war .and
President "Garfield to the revengeful van
ity of a disappointed officeseeker. . Presi
dent McKinley was "-killed by an uttterly
depraved criminal belonging to that body
of criminals who object to all govern
ments, good '»and bad alike, who are
against any form of popular liberty if it
is guaranteed by even the most-just and
liberal laws and who- are as hostile to
the upright exponent of a free people's
sober will as to the tyrannical and irre
sponsible despot, y .-■--; y- ... V
THE . OIiJECT OF THE BLOW.
President McKinley was a mad of mod-,
crate means, a-man whose stock sprang
from the sturdy tillers of the soil, who
had? himself belonged among the. wage
workers,' who had entered the army as a
private soldier.Wealth was not struck at
when the president was assassinated, but
the honest toil which is content with
moderate gains after a lifetime of unre
mitting labor largely in the service.of the
-public. Still less was power struck at
In the sense that power is irresponsible
or centered in the hands of any one in
dividual. The blow was not aimed at
tyranny or wealth. It.was aimed at one
of the strongest champions the wage
worker has ever had, at one of the most
faithful representatives" of the system;of
public rights and representative govern
ment who has ever risen to public office.
President McKinley , filled that . political
office for- which the entire people" vote,
and no-president, not; even Lincoln -him
self was ever more earnestly anxious to
• represent the well thought out wishes of
the people. His one anxiety, in every
crisis was to keep in closest-touch-with
the people, to find out what they thought
and to endeavor to give expression to
their thought after having endeavored to
guide that thought aright. A He had just
been re-elected to the presidency -be
cause the majority of our citizens, the
majority of our farmers and wagework
, ers"*, believed .that he had faithfully .up
held their interests for four years.y They
felt themselves .in -close, and intimate
touch with him. They felt that he rep
resented so well and so honorably all
> their ideals and - aspirations y that - they
wished him to continue for.another four
years" to represent them.. ■.*.- a: a-".
And ' this Was. the man' at whom . the as
sassin struck! . .That- there ----- might •'- be
nothing lacking to :' complete * the - Judas
•like jnfamy. of his act he took" advantage
of "an ■ occasion when the";president "?was
The St. Paul Globe
meeting the people generally, and, ad
vancing as if to take the hand out
stretched to him in kindly and brotherly
fellowship, he turned the noble and gen
erous confidence of the victim into an
opportunity -to strike the fatal blow.
There is no baser deed in all the annals
of crime. ■ V < ■ A
The blow was aimed not at this presi
dent, bul at all presidents, at 'every sym
bol of government. A President "McKinley
was as emphatically the embodiment of
the popular -will of 7 the nation expressed
through the forms of law" aS a New? Eng
land town meeting is in similar fashion
the embodiment of., the law abiding pur
pose and practice Of the . people ;of the
town. On no conceivable theory could the
murder of the president be accepted. as
due to protest against "Inequalities in the
social 1 order" save as the murder of all
the freemen engaged in a town meeting
could be accepted as -a protest against
that social inequality which puts a male
factor in jail. Anarchy is no 'more an
expression of "social discontent"; than
picking pockets or wife beating. *
ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS.
The anarchists, and especially the an
archist in the United States, is. merely
one type of criminal, more dangerous
than any other ' because -he a represents
the same depravity? in; a : greater degree, j
The man who advocates? anarchy directly
or indirect. in any shape or fashion or
the man who apologizess for ' anarchists
and their deeds makes himself morally
accessory to murder before the fact. The
anarchist is a criminal-whose perverted
instincts -.- lead him j§ to -prefer?l confusion
and chaos |to the most beneficent form of
social order. His J protest |of concern for
.workirigmen is - outrageous -in .its impu
dent . falsity, . for if > the >7 political * institu
tions of this country do not afford oppor
tunity to every honest and -Intelligent son
of toil then the door of hope is forever
closed against him. The anarchist is
everywhere . not merely • the ';. enemy of
system - and progress, ? ; but the ! deadly,, foe
Of liberty. ' If ever anarchy is triumphant,?
its triumph v.-ill last -but for one red mo
merit, to be succeeded for ages<by the
gloomy * nij"ht -of depotism.v. -—a -*--;
For the anarchist himself, whether he
preaches or - practices his i doctrines, we
need not have one particle ! more? concern
than for any- ordinary murderer. He |is
not the victim of social or political injus
tice. There are: no » wrongs .to - remedy hi
his case.' The cause of , his • criminality^ is
to be found in his own evil passions and
in the evil conduct of those who urge him
on, not in any failure by others or by the
state to do justice to' him" or. his. yHe is a
malefactor and - nothing else. He is in no
sense, in no shape or way,'a-'-'product: of
social conditions", save as. a:- highwayman
is "produced" by the fact.that an unarm
ed man happens to have a purse. It is a
1 travesty - upon : the : great ■ and i holy - names
of liberty and freedom to < permit them to
%c invoked in such a" causey No ■ man or
: body of men preaching anarchistic • doc
trines should be allowed at * large ' any
more than if preaching; the • murder ?of
some specified private individual. Anarch,
istic | speeches, writings and meetings - are
essentially seditious and treasonable.
SHOULD KEEP? ANARCHISTS OUT.
.1 earnestly recommend to the congress
that in the exercise of its .wise discretion
it should take into consideration the com
ing toI this country of - anarchists 'or per
:sons" professing 'principles'." hostile >to. all
government and -justifying the j murder of
; those"placed in authority. Such individ
!. uals as those who: not long ago gathered

X on the Occasion of the Formal Opening. ;
Splendid Triumph of St. Paul's Public Spirit Displayed
g| in the Grandeur of the Most Complete Club f
||? \,y: Rooms in the Entire North west.
,--.-From 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon un
til nearly midnight last night, the Com-"
mercial club acted as host to one? of the.
largest public receptions that has ever
been held in St. Paul.- During the hours
of 'receiving there was almost a constant
' stream of -. prominent rr citizens ? and their
wives, to be entertained by the club and
to inspect the magnificent new? quarters.
that were yesterday '. thrown open to the
members of the club for the first time.
Al At 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon Presi
dent H. A. Boardman, of the club, and
-R:-L». Ware, representaing t^e owners of
the Germania building, formally opened
the hew quarters of the club, and the In
flux began: . •• i?' . ? -".-..-.,.?:.-.-
The elevators carried the guests to. the
eighth floor,;where they were shown to
the cloak room, ~ From here they went
up to ■< the next floor,. where are located
the r club - rooms, and j members of j the re
ception: committee '- took ? them ?in ;■ hand
and escorted y them "through the finest
club rooms that the Northwest can boast
of..A *--??:a
. .Mr. C. H.«» Woods, chairman of the com
mittee? on entertainment for the day,
did his full share to make the guests feel
at home and enjoy themselves.: In the
main parlor, which : is without a doubt
the . handsomest room outside ?of a pri
vate dwelling, In the city, there was sta
tioned a string orchestra, which furnish
ed "strains '? bf ' sweet z music. A while the
guests lingered, enraptured with the sur
. roundings, ..? the -. A- men ' . metaphorically,
smacking their lips over their new quar
ters, and the women gazing admiringly,
but enviously, upon the sumptuous quar
ters prepared for? the ease and comfort
of 'their; "better halves." •"_ • ?-."?•
On- the ninth floor are the ladles* din
ing room and their parlor.
The members will have the pleasure
PRICE TWO CEXTSH!.V E ra cEvr S .
and the privilege of dining; their wives
and friends in this ladies' dining room,
and. there-.will be an. attendant in charge
of the ladies'? parlor to look ; after ,their
wants.- Thus |the \ men have thrown a
' slight ... "sop ?to .Cerberus,". In providing
tor the entertainment of the fair sex..
. To Tempt- the : Male Sex.
' It is upon this floor that .the, card room
.is -located," and there 'is a smoking room,
furnished in leather, that would lure any
man: away from the strenuous task of
.making, hard dollars:'and:: carry him
dreamily into fairyland, with the aid -of
a good Havana, purchased, of course, '. at
the club's stand*, where 'only, .the best is
to be obtained. A . :,': * . -..
:Going to the next * floor, the ■ billiard;
room .. is . reached. '. It is ' a large roomy
room,.- with a number of tables finely
equipped, and is, by the way, the only
room in the house in" which the furniture
used is not made .".-in ,St \ Paul,? and the
j only reason for this is the fact that there?
■ is *'" no concern rin the city that makes .
billiard "tables.
There are a number of private J dining
rooms, the largest of which is. capable of
accommodating. twelve people, to be used
for private banquets, last-night bachelor
suppers,: etc.. There are a* number of
smaller ones, * finished?ln?blue, red, yel
low ? and different ? colors, each one a
model in settings'and "furnishing. ■':-.
Then comesj what? interests theshouse-,

refrigerator, built by a local firm; a pan
try, with:-. its - spacious j shelves covered
with dainty china; the long steam; tables,
where the t dainties are kept .warm; the j
huge' range, the .meat block, and, last of
all, an electric contrivance that' washes
the dirty? dishes while^your.wait.'- This ls
regarded by "the * club as one \of their su
perior attractions."; No? more' broken or
cracked dishes. No longer will the clum- 7
sy dishwasher .'drop the , costly cup, for
all he as \to3do\is ito \ put the dishes in
a round.tin? reservoir and .turn a switch,
and - In. a ? minute j the {dishes are : cleansed
and ready; to be rinsed through ? boiling.
hot water and '-. placed on the Crying, rack.
All of .which. is accomplished without on*
