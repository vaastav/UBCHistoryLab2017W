Oliver Browx, a son of Old John
Brown, and supposed to be the only stir
yivor of those who participated with the
old man in his -raid on Harper's Ferry,
is living on Jay Cooke's island, Gibral
tar, in Lake Erie.
The State Board of Canvassers has
completed the canvass. of the returns of
the late election, .and issued a certificate
to Mr.-Humphrcys, and he was sworn
Into office. The Attorney General will
now obtain a writ of quo warranto against
Mr.H., and hit right to the office will be
tested by judicial proceedings at once.
A horrible murder was committed
in Pottawattomie County, a few days
ago. Rev. Mr. Wblpert, a Methodist
minister stationed at , in Clay
.County, left his homo about the 1st of
November to go to his farm near Topeka
for a load of apples. After that time,
nothing was heard from him by his
friends until a few days since, when it
was learned that his team had been sold
to a man near Wamego. The person
vwbo sold the team a young man named
J. D. True was arrested and taken to
Louisville, the county seat of Potta
wattamie County. A mob took the
prisoner, and by threats compelled him
to tell where the body of Mr. Wolpert
was concealed, after which he was re
turned to the officers. A party started
out, and found the body of the mur
dered man, just where True had stated
it to be. It had been left in a ravine,
.without covering, and was horribly mu
tilated by birds and beasts. The pris
oner is confined in the jail at Louisville,
and denies that he killed Mr. W., but
alleges that one Clark Allen is the
.murderer, and employed him (True) to
.sell the team on shares. True also says
that Allen told him where the body was
.concealed. There is great excitement
about Louisville and vicinity, and it is
eared that the prisoner will be taken
.out of jail and lynched.
THE FttESlDEM'S MESSAGE-
We publish on our outside this week
the first annual message of President
Hayes, delivered before Congress on
Monday last. It is an able and carefully
prepared document, and while we do
not endorse all of it, it still contains
many valuable suggestions which' Con
gress will do well to heed.
In regard to his Southern policy, we
cannot aree with the President in his
views concerning its results. It is prob
ably true that under it reace and quiet
have prevailed at the South to a greater
extent that heretofore, but this state of
affaire has been the result of the com
plete intimidation of Republicans
white as well as black through his non
interferencepolicy. The same thing might
have happened under Gen. Grant's ad
ministration, bad he seen fit to with
draw federal protection from the ballot
box,and there would have been noRepub
lican party in the South at the last Presi
dential election Samuel J.Tilden would
have been in the whitehouse to-day, and
Rutherford B. Hayes would have been
simply Governor of Ohio. In this opin
ion, however, we may be mistaken, and
we sincerely hope that we are. It Is pos
sible that all classes of citizens in the
South are fully protected in -the free ex
ercise of all their civil and political
rights, but all the evidence we have seen
and heard upon the subject so far, con
firms us jn the opposite belief.
On the silver question the President
takes moderate ground. He admits that
an additional amount of coin is needed,
but thinks that in. making silver an un
limited legal tender, an exception should
be made in favor of onr national debt.
So far as bonds issued since 1873 are
concerned this view is probably correct,
as since that time gold has been the only
coin in this country recognized as mon
ey; but in regard to bonds issued prior
to that date, we think the case is entirely
different, for up to that time the silver
dollar had been' the unit of our money,
and a legal tender for any amount. We
hope, however, that the friends of the
silver bill will so modify it as to meet
the President's yiews. When a man is
hungry "half a loaf is better than no
bread," and such a bill as Mr. Hayes
suggests is decidedly better than none.
Regarding the repeal of the resump
tion act, the President expresses himself
with great positiveness, as being opposed
to any change in the present law. If
the silver bill passes, so that both silver
and gold can be used, it is possible that
resumption may take place at the time
contemplafed, without very greatly de
ranging the commercial interests of the
country, but if it takes place in gold
alone, wo look for a general prostration
of business, only equaled by the panic
of 1873.
The President recommends the levy
ing of an import duty on tea and coffee.
We differ with him again there. Tea
and coffee are articles of general con
sumption among the poorer classes and
nnless the necessity for additional reve
nue becomes more pressing than it now
seems to be, no tax should collected from
them.
- The other suggestions contained in the
meajage we generally approve." On the
whole, the message, though. a very able
one, will be decidedly unpopular in "the
'West, for the present, at least.
THE "DOLLAR 6P 8UR DABD1ES."
The Bint of the United States waa es
tablished by s act of Congress passed
April 2. 1792 for the purpose of provid
ing "a national coinage." The act de
clares that the "money of account shall
be expressed in "dollars or units, dimes
or tenths, cents or hundredths, and mills
or thousandths." The dollar was taken
as the unit or standard, from the fact
that prior to the establishment of our
independence, the old, (silver) Spanish
dollar was largely in use in the colonies
and for many years, had practically been
the unit of value in most commercial
transactions.
Prior to the passage of this act, the
question as to whether the money of the
country should consist of a double or
single coinage was discussed by Alexan
der Hamilton and other eminent finan
ciers, and it was decided that both the
precious metals should be used, as either
alone was thought to be insufficient.
The act also placed the relative value of
the metals at 15 to 1. The weight of the
silver coins was fixed at 371.25 grains of
pure silver per dollar, and gold coins
at 24.5 grains of pure gold to the dollar.
No gold dollar pieces were coined under
this act. Silver alone was used for the
coinage of the dollar, and the fractions
thereof, except cents and half cents,
which were made of copper.
At the time the relative values of the
two metals were fixed for coinage, silver
judged by the bullion markets of the
world, was slightly overrated as com
pared with gold. In 1803 th'e French
government placed the relative value of
the metals at 15 to 1, and this proper;
tion was also adopted by the Latin Un
ion in 1865.
No change in the weight or fineness of
our coin occurred until 1834, when gold
coins were reduced in weight to 23.20
grains.- This change made the relative
value of the metals 16 to 1, which over
rated gold a little. The silver dollar
the unit of value was not changed.
Silver had notalien, but gold had risen
sligh ly.
During this period of forty-two years,
although silver was a little overrated,
there was no unhealthy influx of this
metal, nor was there any perceptible
drain of gold. The two metals circu
lated side by side, and practically, were
of equal value.
In 1837, a slight change was again
made in gold coins. Their fineness was
increased from .899,225 to .900, making
the coins contain 23-22 grains of pure
gold per dollar, instead of 23.20. The
fineness of standard silver was also made
.900, and the weight of silver coin (in
cluding alloy) was 412 grains. The
amount of pure silver, however, remain
ed the same 371.25 grains to tbe dollar.
The most radical change in our silver
coinage occurred in 1853. As before
stated, the change in the relative values
of the metals made in 1834, slightly un
pervalued silver, and this in connection
with the vast influx of gold following
the unprecedently rich discoveries of
thisjnetal in California and Australia,
produced a scarcity of silver coin. The
government, therefore, reduced the
weight of the subsidiary silver coins to
384 grains of standard silver per dollar;
restricted their legal tender use to the
payment of sums of $5 or less, and dis
continued the practice of coining silver
for individuals. Up to this time all sil
ver coins had been a legal tender to any
amount. No change was made in the
weight or fineness of the silver dollar
piece, -and its legal tender property was
not restricted by this act, but its com
mercial value was about 4 per cent.
more than its nominal worth, and some
7 per cent above that of the new subsid
iary coin. Of course,, the government
found it more profitable to coin the
a nailer pieces, and the coining of the
oid-fashioned dollar was abandoned.
The weight of pure silver in the old-fashioned
"dollar of our daddies," was never
changed. It is perhaps, the only piece
of coin, (expept, possibly, the copper
cent) ever issued from our mint that has
not been changed. In 1873, however,
its coinage was discontinued by act of
Congress, and the gold dollar substituted
in its place as the unit of value. At
wis time me iractionai silver coins-l
were increased in weight from 384 to
385.8 grains of standard silver to the
dollar, to make them correspond with
the Latin five franc piece. Their legal
tender value was also restricted to the
payment of sums of five dollars, or less.
There is nothing, however, in the act
of 1873 destroying the legal tender prop
crties of the old silver dollar, but in
1874, a revision of the United States
statutes was made, and the wording of
the original act was so changed by tbe
revisers as to limit the legal tender power
of the dollar to the same extent that the
subsidiary coins had been restricted in
1873: The committee making the revis
ion were instructed to make no changes
in the laws then in force. Its duty was
simply to condense and simplify the stat
utes by throwing out laws which from
time to time had been repealed. Instead,
however, of confining its attention to the
specific object for which it wasappointed
the committe made a radical change 'in
the law of 1873, and Congress adopted
the revision supposing it to be just what
ii snouia nave ocen, simply a compen
dium of laws already in force.

THE INTER OCEAN.
1878. 1878.
THREE EDITIONS.
WEEKLY, BEMI-WEEKLY AND DAILY.
In making its seventh annual an
nouncement, The Liter Ocean reassures
its readers aud the public generally of
its laitb tonne Republican party and its
devotion to Republican principles. Its
record the past year has made it more
than ever before the great representative
Republican paper of the country. The
value of such a paper and its influence
for good were never more apparent than
during the electoral complications of
last fall and winter, llie course of The
later Ocean during that trying period,
won for it the admiration ana lasting
friendship of Republican eveiywbere.
As an exponent of true Republicanism,
to which the public turned for advice
and encouragement, The Inter Ocean stood
throughout the momentous struggle
wituout a peer.
There never was a time when Rcpub
licans more needed a journal steadfast
and true than now. Never before.in tbe
history of the country, has there been a
period of such political interest and in
quiry as is now in tbe immediate future.
Great questions are to be discussed and
disposed of ; embarrassing complications
are to be grappled witn ; fundamental
principles are to be defended. Republi
can to the core, The Inter Ocean will give
all possible informatiou on all political
topics, and while treatingopponents with
the greatest fairness, will maintain its
high standing as an earnest and outspo
ken advocate of uncompromising and
unadulterated .Republicanism.
While The Inter Ocean stands second
to 'no paper in country as a political
journal, it takes high rank as an enter
prising and thorough going newspaper.
During the past year it has eclipsed all
Western papers in the excellence, com
pleteness, and reliability of its foreign
dispatches and letters, and has had few
equals in presenting in most readable
shape general and home news. In every
part of the world great events are occur
ring, with probabilities pointing to more
important in the future. Never before
was a good newspaper so important to
young and old.
In all that goes to make a firftclats
newspaper, The Inter Ocean 13 not e.v
crllcd by any publication in thocouutry.
It is a national newspaper, one that will
bo found useful and interesting to Amer
icans in every part of the globe. While
it especially represents the great inter
est.s of the Northwest, it is national in
its views and comprehensive in its news
gathering.
The Inter Ocean makes especial claim
as a family newspaper, devoting more at
tention than any other political newspa
per to departments prepared and con
ducted with the wants of the home and
the demands of the family in view.
The Commercial Department is con
ducted with preat care, and everything
possible is done to make the market re
ports reliable and complete.
The Agricultural Department is care
fully edited by a gentleman, of ability
and experience.
The Home Department m of special
interest to the ladies, and is devoted to
the practical and useful.
To Educational Matters especial atten
tion is pivon. Believing that the perpe
tuity of fie republic depends upon the
eilucatr n ol the people, J he Inter Ucean
is the warm advocate of the free a:hol
system, aid evert t'ring that will im
prove and extend it.
The. Woman's Kingdom is a new de
partment devoted to the interests of that
larce portion of the gentler sex who,
either from necessity or otherwise, debiro
to devote themselves to some useful oc
cupation or profession, tor tlie purpose
of earning a livelihood. It is -not for
the advocacy of any particular issue, but
for the general improvement and eleva
tion of the female character in ever' dc
partment of life.
The Question and Answer Depart
ment, long a special feature of The Inter
Ocean, ts a valuable encyclopedia of in
formation, and covers as much ground
in the course of a year as many of the
elaborate works published at such high
prices.
The Inter Ocean has the largest aggre
gate circulation of any newspaper pub
lished in the Northwest. It is sent to
more than 8,500 post-offices, distributed
in every State and Territory in the Uni
ted States, in all the British provinces,
and numerous foreign states and coun
tries. TERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION:
