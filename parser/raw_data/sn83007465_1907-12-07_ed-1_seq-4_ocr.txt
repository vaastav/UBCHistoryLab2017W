In order to enjoy pood health,
says a Chicago physician, "drink
two quarts of water and take a
cold bath every day." Any old
health would be bettor than e.

Yes, but it will be from the

case of all you lellows who make
light, of so heavy a thing an your,
wives' cooking.

All men and all women living
in a Christian country and in the
midst ot our civilization should
marry. The family is the foundation
of our civilization, and the
Christian religion gives us the
purity and the sweetness of the
fireside Abbeville Prese and
Banner.
All of which is eminently
true, but the inquiry naturally
arises, why is it that Editor Wilson,
of t he Press and Banner,
.who is himself a confirmed old
bachelor, has never practiced
what ho so well preaches?
It is shown by one of Col.
Kohn's intereKting cotton mill
articles iit he NewH and Courier j
that "the cotton mills in this!

neighborhood of #12,00t),000 for j
' labor "lone." The amount ot

not generally realized what an
immense sum of money Lancaster's
great manu'acturing plant
causes to be put iu circulation
here yearly.
As published in Wednesday's
News, and again in today's pa
per, in the list of Conference
appointments, Lancaster loses
both of ner popular Methodis'
ministers, Mr. Turnipseed, of
the First Methodist church, be#

and Mr. Carter, of Grace churcl,
to Vanwyck. These ministers'
ave served their Lancaster I
harges faithfully, ably and well,
nd the entire community, irrepective
of denominational lines,
incerely regrets their removal to
J
tiler fields of labor.
Bishop Morrison certaiuly (
'shook up" the South Carolina ,
Conference from center to cir- i
sumference by bis appointments, ,
)ut it is hoped that everything ,
vill work out all right in the
rnd. By the wholesale and sur)ri?ing
changes made deep dis
ippointment has been caused in
nany communities, but time
done will prove the wisdom or
oily of the bishop's apparently
evolutionary action. In no event
lowever, will tie loyalty of the
dethodisls and tbeir abiding
aith in the wisdom of the it meruit
system be shaken. Of the 235
ninislers in the Conference, as
many as 150, it is stated, were
moved."
ADVICE TO PREACHERS.
Bishop Morrison m iy be an
extremist, a in n of radical action,
trom some points of view, but
his head is leyel when it comes
o defining the duties anil re
sponsibilities of a minister. In the
main, he has a proper concep'ion
ol what ? preacher's course and
attitude should be, especially toward
bis congregation. In his
address at GafFney to the class
of young ministers Bishop Mor
risou is quoted as saying:
In preaching you should first
know what the people need. G<?
to the Bible and get an inspired
basis for your sermon. Don't
preach what other men have
preached. Make your own sermons.
Throw the 500 outlines
away. Keep in touch with the
spirit and God will give yon
thoughts and ideas. If your sermons
are yours the people will
bear you.
Take care of your voice. The
people will listen to pla'i'udes
even if they can hear them clearJy
When you go to your charge
take charge Take charge of the
whole Church, the Sunday-school,
league, choir, everything. I
abominate a choir that takes
charge ot the preacher. Don't
let your administration be sell
assertive, but wise. Manage your
Church as a wise wile manages
her husband ?without letting
the Church know it. Take charge
of yourself. Ke<>p sweet and gentle.
Remember that what are
sometimes called Methodist peculiarities
are oftentimes ou>
strengt h.
Don't go into the ministry to
he an ecclesiastical politician.
In torty-two years of service I
have never gone to a Bishop or
prc;j !mg e1 d t about, my :*p

President's Message to Congress
this Week in a NutShell.
Atlanta Journal, of Wednesday.
The annual message of Pre?iTheodore
Roosevelt, read
today before the joint session of
both liouues of the Sixtieth United
States congress, contains
thirty thousand words.
The president recommends
federal licenses or national charters
for corporations.
He recommends that any revision
of the tariff be postponed
at least until atter the election.
He proposes that the congress
appropriate money nocessaiy to
defray the expenses ot the leading
national parties in presidential
elections.
Of most vital importance from
the viewpoint of the President is
the recent financial depression or
stringency, pointing to the moral
lesson of purgation of dishonest
business metnoas.
Tlie anther of the message
urges piompt action as to a definite
currency plan, though the
minutia of the proposition receives
no tangible suggestion
from the president
Relative to the currency plan,
however, the president suggest*
that it must be of sufficient elasticity
to enable its speedy retirement
after the financial stringency
be passed.
The president follows his previous
declarations as to railroads
and corporations, advocating all
the publicity possible in regard
to the inside workings of giant
corporations throughout the
country.
He empha'ically urged federal
incorporation or conditional !i
censes, which, together with si
! wholesome governmental >-uperv!
jsion, he believes would prevent
t
a great deal of dishonesty which
h ?s been prevalent in the past
in the various channels ol business
and trade.
The present tariff system, th*
president says, is responsible foi
the excellent balance which pre
vails between our expenditure!
and income, pointing with nridf
to the yearly average of $31,000,
000.
lie is of the opinion that tin
tariff system should be giveL
careful scrutiny to prevent an}
tendency to growing abuses ii
the administration of this im
portant feature of the govern
ment.
The president is heartily 11
i favor of an income tax, thong]
i tie saj s he speaks with iovoreuc
'due to the contrary decision o
*
the United States supreme com
, on the subject.
i It is the opinion ot the presi
dent that recent prosecution
' have successfully denied the ol
reasons given that it had bee
inioossible to imuieh dishonest
> where the multy were men *
i great wealth.
In discussing railroad arc
dents the president declares th?
, more peopl? are being killed >
. the great, steam highways of th
country than are claimed in til
wars of the world. He urges tin
the federal government invest
gate railroad accidents.

Employers* liability, western n

and many other matters ot espe s

more than passing interest is his

Herewith we publish, in response
to the call of the Comptroller
of the Currency, a statement
of condition of this bank
at the close of business December
3rd, to which we respectfully
invite your closest scrutiny.
It reflects, we believe,
an unsurpassed condition of stability
and must impress the
public with the conservatism
with which the affairs of this
institution are managed. Note
that the cash on hand and in
banks is more than 146 per
.cent, above legal requirements
and that we have no money
I borrowed.
