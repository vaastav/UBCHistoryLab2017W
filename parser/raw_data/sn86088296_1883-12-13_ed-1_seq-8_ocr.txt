The decision of the supreme court
of Georgia that cotton future notes
aire void, and that dealing in futures
is simply gambling, is unquestionably
in the interest of public morals and
sound business. A good authority
estimates that the South loses not less
than 530,000,000 yearly in this form of
.peculation, and whatever may be the
Bum. it is as fruitlessly wasted to the
Southern people as though it were
thrown away.
The widow Hoar has rushed fran
tically to the front in the interest of
Woody-shirtism, and has introduced a
bill in the Senate providing for in
crease in federal machinery at elec

Senate to do, probably, is to let her
have rope. Tho Northern people, as
well as those of tho South, will be
found ready to protest vigorously
against their ballots being deposited
under the surveilance of armed min
ions of the party in power.

To enow the feasibility of a dam
to raise the water of the Colorado to
a level that it may be used lor manu
factories on. the river bank in the low
est portion of the city, it may be
stated that a dam fifty-eight feet high
is now being constructed in Brazil.
To dam the Colorado river for manu
facturing purposes at Austin, would
require only an ordniary dam, since it
-would be raised some distance np the
river, the water being conveyed by
canal to the points for manufacture.
It would be worth millions to Austin.
The Drover's Journal suggests as

Heke is the way the Salt Lake
News, organ of Mormonisni, regards
the questions raised oa the existence
of polygamy:
"The president's message will be
hailed by the hireling clergy with
' pleasure, and receive certain amount
of popular support. It is not shown
inwhatwiy the destruction of our
-local government would affect the
-question of polygamy. The plural
marriages of Mormons are not recog
nized bv the territorial laws and could
not be dissolved by the commissioners'

The president's remarks on Utah
polygamy do not add force to his mes
tsage noi." credit to hia statesmanship.
They are sop to the bigots and breath
tu the flame of popular passion. It is
loubtful if it will have a practical
hearing on Cocgrce?, and certainly
will create no commotion among the
tiod-fearing people of Utah."
' As reported in our department re
ports, the .governor entertains the
opinion, that there can be no question
s;s to tho validity of the Gibson certi
ficates, which were lrgally issued ac
cording to the mandatory provisions
of the law. This would make the
:laim of the Galveston syndicate good
a-i to the alternate sections, but it is
jnstioru.ble whether they could sub
utitate their claim for the fifty cents
lands under subsequent tiles covering
the entire territory previously covered
alternately. The la wdioldingau perma
nent all locations of school sectloo?,
whether under valid or invalid certifi
cates, applying m this case, would
leave the state lands, amounting la
value to nearly a million of dollars. If
the original claims be recognized, and
not that under tho fifty cents law the
syndicate will secure lands worth
nearly a million dollars, while the
state will secure the same. The deci
sion of the land board upon the valid
ity of the second claim is therefore an
important question in which the state
has a large share of interest
The Times-Democrat should stuJy
the political history of Tex H more
thoroughly before it cites points, al-
lnjrryl to bs connected with it. to
strengthen an argument applicable io
a federal political question, it sajs.
The nrtsent constitution ot lexas
moke3 many important changes in its
land system. IJy the terms ot its ad
mission into me i nion, xexas re
served to itseli its utire public do
main, amounting to nearly lau.wu.uuu
acres. This was usea 10 ueveiop me
stiit.A :tnri increase its wealth and pop
ulation. All immigrants were granieu
innie.4teads: railroads were Riven so
in-iTiv thousand acres for every nine
of road built, and land wa3 voted lib
erally for every public purpose. J.ne
people of Texas awoke a short time
Atrn to the fact that the state had very
nearly exnausitu its puuuc uumuiu,
and that there was very little land left
for a school fund, unless some less ex
travagant system was adopted.
This whs done in the new constitu
Hn Thn old law. which allowed
every immigrant to enter 160 acres of
land as a homestead, was abolished,
as this land generally fell into the
hands of speculators, and Texas was
too great a state, holding out too
many inducements to emigrants to
ncwi offer this additional bonus. As
to the railroads, they also, it was
urged, would build, whether they re
ceived land from the state for doing
so or not. Hence, the usel ssness of
hi tionat.ion. These ideas are incor-
rwimtwi in the new constitution of
Texas, which sets aside the public
lands of that state for certain specified
purposes, fixing the minimum price at
which it is to be sold three times as
high as previously. The wisdom of
these changes is shown in the fact that
Texas has received more emigrants,
hnilh more miles of railroad ana in-
creased its wealth more under the new
system that it ever did in the same
nr.rinrt of time under the old plan of
giving bonuses. The commissioner of
t.h trpneral land office urires the fed
eral crovernment to attempt similar
avstpm in regard id the public domain
it. him been even more reckless than
Texas. While its donations of lands
have done much in the way of settling
thecountrv. buildini railroads, etc,
millions of acres have been thrown
away, and the public domain has
at, own so small that it is well no w to
become more economical.
The railwavs were not denied the
acuuision of lands under the new con
stitution, which went into effect m
187(5. Since then the treat reserva
tion made to the Texa3 & 1'acitic rail
way company was kept in force by leg
islative enactment, and it was kept
alive until the road was built, uniting
in "Western Texas with the S uithern
Pnciiie. The International, by fail
ure to build on time, forfeited its
original charter many years ago. Other
railways took outjeharters, sintothe
adoption of the new constitution, un
der the general incorporation law, and
all who applied for land certificates
the time of the repeal by the legisla
ture in special session, in 1882, were
granted them. These certificates
called for land from the unappropri
ated ilomain. and issuance of certi
ficates were not stopped until the
called legislature passed the law re
quiring non-issuanee. Kailway cer
tificates, now outstanding, are
erood when unappropriated land
may be found upon which
to locate them. Upon the repeal
of the law crantinjr certificates to
railways, railroad building in Texas
was retarded, but the law was
repealed because the public domain
was known to be about exhausted.
The scarcity of the public lands, even
prior to the repeal of the law caused
many companies to not apply for cer
tificates under the general incorpora"
tion law. Were lands now being
granted for railway building, more
lines than ever would be under con
struction. The lands granted to rail
ways were given, not only to secure
the construction of railways, but th6
grants were beneGcial to the school
fund. The grants were in alternate
sections, every other section being
surveyed and marked for the school
fund. The granting of land3 to the
roiiumva hav thus see.nred Texas
railways and a sectionized sys em of
school lands, which adds greatly to the.
latter's value. Anything done by the
railway companies for the benefit of
their land3 inures to the benefit of the
school lands. It is useless to say the
granting of lands for railway building
does not and would not secure tne
construction of roads. The only
thing which has given life to railway
instruction i.i Mexico has been her
public grants to railway coiupauies.
The St. L'.uiis It-publican calls
attention to a falacy. In his recent
report the secretary of thfl treasury
goes back t went i -three years to lax-
down the very doubtful proposiilioni
"first, that "the civil war could net
have been carried on and brought to a
desirable result bud not the bonds of
the United States b vn issnKd an.!
found acceptance with iiii.-i.tjtd una;
and, second, that they would not have
found that acceptance had it not been
or the lead and the effort of the
national banks." Even if this were
true, says the Bepnblican, there is no
rted of dinning it for'eyer Jn the ears
of the people. The people owe the
result of the ciyil war to their own
efforts, not to banks and moneyed
men; and this persistent attempt to
manufacture a debt of giatitude from
the country to the banks and capital
ists for the fervid patriotism of buy
ing United States bonds at 35 cents on
the dollar and selling them at 100, is
unmitigated tomfoolery. National
nanks and moneyed men who dealt in
United States bonds have been better
paid thrice better paid for what they
did in the civil war than any other
class of citizens. They have received
from the government special favors
and Tirivileires. worth, from first to
last, not less than $1,000,000,000. The
national banking system exits for the
good of the country, not for the bene
tit of the bankers as these Republican
officials appear te imagine.
The Centennnial Cotton Exposi
tion, about which so much fuss is be
ing, made, is to be held at New
Orleans In December, 1884. The Cot
ton Planters' Association of America
began to agitate the subject about a
yeaf ago, and it was decided to fix the
expositloa for the time and place
named. The first bale of American
cotton ever exported was shipped to
England in 1784, hence the signifi
cance in having such exhibition next
year. But the Idea has since grown
into a world's fair projsct, on a larger
scale than was even the Philadelphia
exhibition in 1876. The main build
ing, as determined by the directors,
will coyer an area of one million
souare feet, or 15 per cent mora than
was occupied by tho principal struct
ure at Philadelphia, and, although jt

Dlated.lt is certain that throughout
the cotton erowintr 3tateS a most de
cided interest is felt in the undertak

"What does this new proposed ap
plication for the right of way alon

transport freight for the ue o tne
capitol syndicate, mean? An em
(3 -
ployee of the syndicate is engaged in
circulating a petition i:i favor of the

nun have signed it. the syn
dicate has already been granted
right of way for a rail
way to the site of the new capi
tal, and the grading and bridging
along the line granted has already
been finished, and the roud bed is now
leady for the iron. Therefore just as
thi3 juncture immediately in advance
of the contemplated iini3hing of this
railway, why a petition should be cir
culating In favor of a freight railway
along Congress Avenue Is hard to
understand. The only solution that
may be saieiy arriveu at is,
that there is some sort of
pure cussedness at the bottom of
it. There must be some ulterior ob
ject to be gained in the acquirement
of this route. This was quite appa
rent before, and the renewed effort
proves it. Certain aldermen, it is said,
signed the petition; now let enough
more of them do it. and then pass an
ordinance, granting the right of way
along Congress Avenue, and the entire
revenue of the city will have to be
expended in paying armed men to en
force the measure. There will be war
in Austin when such a day comes,

to have felt ashamed to refer to the
fact that "at the time tli j present ex
pciit.ivA intered unon his Olhce niS
death, removal, resignation or inabil
ity to discharge his duties would have
loft the government without a consti
tutional head." That is true; and the
reiison for so unprecedented and dan
gerous a condition of affairs was the
disregard of the unbroken precedents
of over a cent ury by Mr. Arthur, then
vice-President of the Lnited States,
who refused to vacate the chair in the

to be chosen by that body, because its
then Democratic majority would not

whom it should select for the place.
We take it for granted that the
Cleveland Herald, one of the ablest
Republican organs in Northern Ohio,
knows what it is talking about in this
paragraph
"There is no doubt but that Presi
dent Arthur is seeking a renomina-

less strong than is tho will of the peo

Cleveland the ropes are being laid and
the pins set for President Arthur's re
nomination. The question has been
asked why tho Herald is opposed to
his nomination ? That is easily an
swered. Because he cannot bring out
the Republican vote. It will take
Republican enthusiasm to carry Ohio
next year. We have nothing against
President Ar'hur as a man, and hi3
administration has bee clean, safe and
respectable, but would Ohio 'enthuse

TlialieU sunset, Cyclones and Earth
quakes Foretelling Cominsf Disas
terHow to Mret It.
The recent mysterious appearances
following sunset and preceding sun
rise have attracted wide attention
om students of the skies and the
people generally. During the days of
recent, v.eeKs tne bun seems to have
been obscured .by the thin veil of a
dull leaden hue which, as the sun re
eded toward the horizon, became
more luminous, then vellow, then
orange, then reu; and, as night ,-ettled
down upon the earth, a dull purple.
At tirst it was thought these appear
ances were ordinary sunset reflections
of light, but it is now pretty certain
that they . re either the misty sub
stance of i he tail of some unseen
comet, ia which the earth is envel
oped, or a surrounding stratum of
world i.-.ist or very small meteors.
Prof. Breaks of the Red House ob
servatory, Phelps, N. Y., has turned
his telescope upon these objects and
discovers d what he thinks are myriads
ot telescopic meteors. It it is unor
ganized world dust, or decomposed
vapors, as the Democrat and Chroni
cle of Rochester, N. Y., remarks:
How is this matter to be disposed
of V Will it settle and form a deposit
upon tho earth, or remain a partial
opaque shell about the earth to cut off
a portion ol trie sun s light upon it i"
Whatever the mystery is, there is
no ceuymg mat soma very strange
f rces are at work ia the uoper airs
The terrible tornadoes and cy. lones
which have swept our own country,
and the fearful volcanoes and earth
quakes which have destroyed so many
cities and thousands of people the
tidal waves which mysteriously rise
aud fall on coasts hitherto unvexed
by them the tremendous activity
which is evident in the sun by the
constant revelation of enormous spots
upon its surface all indicate unusual
energy in the heavenly bodies.
These circumstances recall Profes
sor Gnmmer's prophecies that from
1681 to 1S87, the passage of the five
great planets Mars, Neptune, Jupi
ter, Uranus and Saturn around the
sun would produce strange and won
derful phenomena. He says: "The
waters of the earth will become more
or less poisonous. The air will be foul
with noisome odors. Ancient races
will disappear from the earth." He
.attempts to prove his prophecy by the
fact that in 1720, when Mars and Sat
urn made their passage around the
sua coiccidentally, great destruction
aud mortality visited all pirts of the
globe. He also found the same results
in previous perehelion p;issages of the
planets, and argues that these circum
stances always produce epidemics and
destructive diseases which will baffle
the skill of the most eminent physi
cians; that tho poor will die by thou
sands, the weak and intemperate fall
ing first, those whose blood has been
impoverished by excess of work or
dissipation next and only those who
are in comparative vigor shall escape
to enjoy the era of renewed activity
and prosperity which will follow the
period of destruction.
Inasmuch as the entire world seems
subject to the sway of the heavenly
bodies no part of the earth, he thinks
can escape scourging. He even pre
dicts that America will lose over ten
millions of people; that farmers will
be stricken with fear and cease to till
the soil: that famine will make hu
man, misery more wretched. That
hundreds will llee to overcrowded
cities for aid in vain. That sudden
changes in ocean currents, tempera
ture aud surroundings will entirely
transform the face of nature and cli
mate of countries; that the air will
be so foul with malaria and other nox
ious gases that those who survive
will be troubled with disorders of the
digestive organs. That many who
i scape other ills will bloat with dropsy
and suddenly pass away, while others
will grow thin and drag out a miser
able existence in indescribable agony
for weeks. Neuralgic pains in differ
ent parts of the body will torment
them. They will easily tire and be
come despondent. A faint, hot feel
ins will be succeeded by chilly sensa
tions while hallucinations and dread
of impending ill will paralyze all
elfort. "The birds of the - air, the
beasts of the field, and even the fish
of the sea will become diseased,
poisomng the air and poisoning
the v. aters of the globe." We
are told on tho other hand that those
who shall pass through this period of
trial will have larger enjoyment of
life and health. The earth will yield
more abundantly than ever before.
The animal kingdom will be more
prolific and lite prolonged very ma
terially. This prolongation of life
will bo owing to the healthy electric
and magnetic inlluences that will per
vade the atmosphere. It would per
haps seem that the present redness of
the sun, and the presence of a belt or
veil . of cosmic matter, justified, in a
measure, the prediction of Professor
Grimmer, but disturbing as his pre
diction may be, we are told for our
comfort that the strong and pure
blooded need have little to fear in
these calamities, that those who are
delicate or indisposed should adopt
means to keep the system well sup
pirtf d and the blood pure, and that
the most philosophical and effective
method of accomplishing this is to
keep the kidney3 and liver in good
condition. From the testimonials
of such men as Dr. Dio Lewis
and Professor R. A. Gunn. M. D.,
Dean of the United States Medical
college. New York, and thousands of
influential non-professional people, it
seems almost certain that for this
purpose there is no preparation known
to science equal to Warner's Safe
Cure, better known as Warner's Safe
Kidney and Liver Cure. This medi
cine has acquired the finest reputation
of any preparation that was ever put
upon the market. It is a radical
blood purifier, which soothes and heals
all inllamed organs, strengthens the
nervous system, washes out all evi
dences of decay, regulates digestion,
prevents malassimilation of food in a
philosophical and rational manner,
fortifies the system against climatic
changes and malarial influences and
the destructive agencies which seem
to be so abundant in these "evil days."
It is not our purpose to dispute the
cor-eetness of Professor Grimmer's
prophecies. A3 we have said, the
maiked disturbances of the past few
years would seem to give a semblance
of verification of his theory. It is
certain, as above stated, that we are
passing through what may be re
garded as a crucial period and it is
the part of wise men not to ignore,
but to learn to fortify themselves
against the possibility of being over
come by these evils. It is a duty
which each man owes to himself, and
his fellows, to mitigate as much as
possible the suffering or humanity
uud in no way better can he accom
iushthis purpose than to see to it
that he, himself, is fortified by the
best known preparation in the strong
est possible manner and that he exert
the influence of his own example upon
his fellows to the end that they too,
may share with him immunity from
the destructive induences which seek
his ruin .
A writer in a Boston paper says
that the traveler in passing along the
highway, a mile or so above the vil
lage of Xorth Haverhill, X. II.,
reaches and beside a little pine grove,
finds a small grave-yard which con
tains the remains of some of the ear
liest settlers of that section of the
state, and here for over seventy years
have reposed the remains of the brave
Mcintosh, the leader of the Boston
Tea Party, unmarktd by stone and
known to but a lew age 1 people now
living, who remember his burial. He
tills a pauper's grave, having died in
1810 or ISil at the house of a Mr. Hul
burt, who resided at what 13 now
known as the -Poor Farm, and to
whose care he had been bid off a3 a
public pauper at public auction as the
lowest bid, according to the ancient
custom.

Good Ideas from a Eaii Source.
Chicago Tribune, Rep:
The Democrats may not have the
honesty and courage to diminish the
revenue by reducing taxes, upon the
whole people, but if they come for
ward in the next Presidential election
with a record of having made whisky
free in order to retain the taxes on
clothes and household goods they will
encounter tho fate which Mr. Sam
Cox, in discussing this subject, has
predicted for them. The American
people will never indorse the policy of
cheapening whisky at the expense of
the family and the general tax-payer.

Dr. R. Wilson Carr, of Baltimore,
says "he has used Rosadalis in cases
of scrofula and other diseases.
Dr. T. C. Pugh, of Baltimore, re
commends Rosadalis to all persons
suffering with diseased blood, saying
it is superior to anv other preparation!
Rev. Dabney Bail, of the Baltimore

A curious story comes from Brent
ford, England. A servant of Dr. Ter
ry was sent out to carry a message.
She was short sighted, and, failing to
return, it was feared she had fallen
into the canal. It was dragged, but
without success. Several da3rs later an
old bargo woman suggested that a loaf
of bread in which some quicksilver had
been placed should be floated on the
water. This was done and the loaf
became stationery at a certain point.
The dragging was resumed at this
point and the bodj lfound. The super
stition is said to be centuries old, but
no one had seen it tried there for
many a year.
