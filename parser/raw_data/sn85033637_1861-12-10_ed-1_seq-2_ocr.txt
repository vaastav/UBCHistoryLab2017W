Tb Bocietary mt War aa1 IB lar.
The following U that portion of Mr. Oam
Iron's report referred to lb policy to t pr
iik1 with tho reference to the slave popula
tkn of the South:
It has become a grave, qtietion of determi
nation, what shall b doue with tha Slaves
a abandon 1 by their owner on the advance of
oar troop into Southern territory, an in the
lJeatifort district of South Carolina. The
whole white population is six thousand, while
the number of oegrot'S exevds ll irty-two
thousand. The panic which drove iheir mas
ttrs in wild confusion from their homes, leaves
then iu undisputed pOMf-asioa of the soil. -:
Shall thev, armed by their masters, be placed
in the fiafd to fight sgainst u. or shall their
: labor be coutinually empl yed in teproducing
r lh iiMtan for supporting lb armies of the re-
, Ullion I . !
Tho war into abMi this Government ha'
boon forced by rbdliout trtiors, iscairied on
. ,fr the turpose ol re-psei-s ng the jr prtj
viotomly an. tracheroutly i'uv ajon by the
, amies of the (tuvprniiiful, and t rn I'sinb
tib the auihorily nnd laws of the United States
in the places win r it is oitjHisod or ove'ihiown
. y the anneal iu-turrcc'.ion or rebellion. Iu
purkso is to rtcovtr and defend what is just
j) iu own.
War, oven between independent nation,
' in ma le to mibdue the euerny, and all that
Ixdnriji to tliHt t'iKMiiv by occupying lho lion
lite ciMHitry and imfrci-ing dominion ov r all
lh men nnd t ingi wiihin iu territory.
This being trn in respect to independent na
tions at war wiih tm olhrr, it follow that
- TtdieN who ar laboring by force of arms to
overthtow i Govt'rnmvat, justly biingiujj tt-
ib'H)8ov(H all the consr-ijuenci's of war,
and provoke the destruction merited by trie
worst of crime, that Government would txt
false to oatrotiid Irani, and would justly ex
cite tire rlil of lire civdizd world, that
. would abstain from the ue of any efficient
tncaus to preserve its own existence, or to
overcome a rtbt Ilium and traitorous eoemv,
dy sparing or protecting the property of those
who are waging wrr ncinst it.
The principal wealth and jower of ihe'
. relnd States is a peculiar specios of proporty, j
consisting of tho service or labor of Afri J
can slaves, or tin defendants ol Africans. I
This property has been variously estimated at i
the value of from 700,000,000 to 1,000,
O00.000. Why should this property be exempt f.om
the hazards nd consequence of a rebellious
war.
' It was the boast of the leader of the rebtl
, lion, while he yet hud a eat in the Set ate of
the United States, that tho Southern States
' would l e comparatively safe and free from
the burdens of war, if it should be brought
on by the contemp'ated rebeHio", and that
"boasts was accompanied by the savage
threat tliut 'Northern towns and cities would
" become tbi victims of rapine and military
spoil," and that "Northern men should
smell Southern gunpowder and feel Southern
teel."
No on doubts the disposition of the rebels
to carry that threat into execution. The
wraith of Northern towns aud cities, the pro
vince ol Norltcrn farms, Northern workshops
and manufactories, would certainly be seized
destroyed, or appropriated a tuililaiy spoil.
No proper y iu the North would be spared
from the hands of the rebel, and their r pine
wuld be defended upon the war. While the
loyal Stalos thus have all '.heir property
and possesion) at stako, are tho insurgent
rebels to carry on warfare Rgainst the Gov
etuiut'iit in peace i nd security to their own
property f
Reason and'jnstice and self-preservation for
bid iLnl such should be the policy of Ibis Gov
e'timent, but demand on the contrary, that,
being forced by traitor and rebels to the ex
tremity of war, all tho rights and powors of
war should be exercised tobiiug it to a speedy
ii I.
Tbote wh inuk" w?ir a'nt the Govern
ment justly ford-it all lights of property, priv
ih: or security, dei'd from tho Con-
litiition nnd law?, against which they are
in aimed rebellion; and ns the labor and service-
of their thves constitute the chief
piorcrtv of the rebels, 6ucb property should
il a;o tho ccrarcon fate of war to which
they Ijhvo divoted the property of loyal citi
zens.
While it is plain that ihe slave propity of
the South is j.islly sti!jcttd to all the coa
si'iKiicns o this rebellious war, and that thn
Government would bn untrue to its trust in
hot employing all the rights and owwrs of
war to bring it to a speedy close, the details
of the lan for doing ro, like all other mili
tary measure, must in a groat degree be left
to be detei mined by particular exigences.
Tho diaMitioii of other property belonging
to the rebels that becomes subject to our sriu
is governed by the circunifctauci-s of the case.
Tho Govern nun l ban no power to hold slaves,
none to restrain a slave of his lilx-rty, ot to
exact bin service.
It linn a right, however, to use the volun
tary services of hUves I iterated by war from
their rebel maulers, like any other property of
the rebels, in whatever mode may be most
efl'.cient for the dufvusc of the (joverno ent
the pr ocuiion if the war and the suppres
siou of the rebellion. It is as clearly a right
of i he Givernruent to arm lave, when it
may bocoino necessary, as it is to use gun
j'owder taken from th enemy . Whether it
is expedient to do so is purtly a military qu s
tion. The expediency must be determined
by circumstances, keeping in view the great
object of overcoming the rebels, re estab
lishing the laws and restoring peace to the
HHtloO.
It in vain and idle, for (lit G vernment to
carry on this war or hope- to maintain its ex
iitence agai itt rebi lioiM forces, without em
ploying ail the rights and powers of war
As has been said, the right to deprive the
reikis of their property in slaves and slava
labor, is aa clear and ahaolule, as the right to
lake forage from the fi.dd, or cotton from the
waiehouse, or powd- r and aims from the
inagaziue. To leave the enemy in the pos
session of sucii property as forage and cot
ton and military stores, and the moans of con
slaotly reducing them, would bt roadn.
It i, therefoiw, equal madness to leave them
is peaceful and secure possession of si iv
properly, more valuable and effe'ent to them
tor war, than forage, cotton, and militaiy
atores. buch olicy wuald be a national sui ,
ci-le.
What to do with that sjecies of protftlv,
is a question that limn and circunmtHiice will
solve, and need not be anticipated further
than to repeat that they cannot b held by
the Government aa slaves. It would b um
Jcfs to keep them as piatoncrs of war, and
srlf J-rewrvi tioti, the bighenh duty of a gov
eriinient, or of individual, demands that they
should! diotd of or emp!yd in the
luott effective manuer that will tend most
eedily to suppress the insurrection and r a
tore tho authority of the Government. If it
shall le found that the men who have been
held by the libels an tlavvs are capable of
tearing arms ami perfoiiningcliic.eol inirlary
rrvice, it is tho right and may become th
duty of the Government to arm and equip
them, and employ their service aga;nst the
rebels, under proper military regulations, dis
ciplineand command.
But in whatever mam er they my be used
qy the Government, it it plain that, onto
liberated by the ubolliout acts of their mas
tin, they should never again be ietoied l
bondage. Ilr the master'a t'csson and rebel
icus masters, by bis service to the (' rvercmnt
becomes justly entiUed to freedom and pro
ImIiaii
Tb rhspoajtioo to be made of the slaves of
reoois, smvw two umi vi un war, can miw
ly left to the wimlirai and patriotism of Goo
gresa. The Representatives of the peo
ple will unquestionably secure to the lor
al slave holders every right to which they
are entitled under the Constitution of the
country.
The History of the Coanplracy.
From Ohas. Sumner's late speech.
The Union was formed, with the seeds of
conspiracy latent in its bosom. The spirit
already revealed was scarcely silen' : it waa
n)t destroyed. It elill existed, rankling, fes
tering, barning to make itself mmnift. At
the mention of slavery it always appeared full
armed with barbarous pretensions. Even in
the first Congress under the Constitution al
the presentation of lint famous petition where
D-f." v ..: i --IK
nenj wiiiii r raiikiiu aiiuyij mus ujx'u wvu-
gresn to step to the verge of its powers to dis
courage every species of traffic lei our fellow
men this spirit broke forth in violent threats.
With a k ndred lawlessness it early embrac
ed that extravagant dogma of State UighU
which has b"en ever since the convenient
cloak of treason and of conspiracy. As the
Missouri Question in 1820, it onlv menaces a
dissolution of the Union. Instead of throl
lling thj monster we submitted to feed it
with new concessions. Meantime the con
spiracy grew until al last in 1830, under the
influence of Mr. Calhoun, it assumed the do
fUnl front of Nullification; nor did it yield to
the irremeable logic of Webster or the stern
will of Jackson without a compromi-e. The
pretended ground of complaint was the tar
iff but Audrew Jackson, himself a patriot
slave rnlder at that lime President saw
tho hollowness of the complaint. In a con
fidential letter, which baa only recently
been brought to light dat'd at Washing
ton lsl May, 1833 and which during the
last winter I had the honor of reading and
holding up before the couspiraiois of the
Senate, in the original autograph ho say:
"The Tariff was only the pretext aid dis
union and the Southern Confederacy the real
object. The next pretext will he the negro or
tlavery quetUon.
Jackson waft undoubtedly right; but the
pretext which m denounced in ndvance was
emnloved so constantly afterward as to
become thread bare. At the earliest presen
tation of Addition petitions at the Texas
question at the l;ompromieof looO al tuo
ianas Question on all these occasions trio
Ubion was ihroatered by the augry slave
master. But the conspiracy has been unblushingly
confessed by recent parties to it r.tpci;illy
was this done in the rebel Convention ol
South Carolina.
Mr. Packer said "Secession is no spas
modic iff rt that has come suddenly upon us.
It hat been gradually culminating for a long
tenet of years.
Mr. Ingliith said ''Most of us have bad thu
subject under consideration for the last twen
tv vears.'
Mr. Kei't said have ben engaged
in this movement ever tmce I entered polUt
eal lifer '
Mr. Hbett, who was iu the Senate when I
first entered that body, and did not hesitate
tl en to avow himeelf a Diut ionist, taid
in tl a same Convention, 44 It is nothing pro
duced by Mr. Lincoln' election or the non
execution of the Fugitive Slave Law. 1 a
matter which has been gathering head for
thirty yeart.
The conpiracy thus exposed by Jacksor
ana con leased by recent parties to it, whs
quickened by ths growing passion for slavery
throughout the slave Ulates. The well-known
opinions of the Fathers the declared convic
tions of all who were most eminent at the
foundation o the Government, and the ex
omple of Wahirigt n were all discarded, and
tt was recklossly avowed that slavery is a di
vine institution the highes type of civili
zation a blessirg to master and slave alike
and the very key-stone of our national
arch. A generation has grown up with this
teaching, so that it is now ready ;o say with
Satan:
Fvil t h'i my good: ly the atlctut
Divided empire with IL-uven'i Kini; I hold;
As man era long and this new world shall know.
It is natural that a people thus trained
should listen to tue voico ol conspiracy.
slavery itself is a constant conspiracy, nnd us
supporters, whether in the slave Stales or
elsewhere, easily become indifferent to all
rights and principles by which it may be con
strained.
Kanawha Convention.
WllEELINO, Va., Dec. 2.
In the Convention Mr. llsgan, of Boone
county, offered the following:
Wh ertas, Negro slavery is the origin and
foundation of our national troubles and the
cause of tho terrible) rebellion in our midst,
thai is seeking to overthrow our Government ;
and H'Arura, Slavery is incompatible with
the Word of God and detrimental to the in
terests of a free people, as well as a wrong to
tho slaves themselves; therefore,
Resolved, That the Convention inquire into
the expediency ot making the proposed now
Slate a Fiee State and a provision bo inserted
for the gradual emancipation of all slaves
within tho propesod Iwun laiies of tho new
State, to br submitted to the people of the
same for titers approval or rejection. Refer
red to thn Committee on Fundamental and
General Provisions.
Mr. Brown, of Kanawha, offered the fol
lowing:
Itesolved, That the Slate of Kinawha ought
to assume a just ai d equitabl proportion of
the state debt or V irginia, and in doing so
dicrminaie between its friends aud foes by
paving first the bounds held by her own loyal
citizens; nexi those held by loyal cilizms not
resident in tho State of Kanawha, and of the
excess a pro rata share.
Mr. Caldwell, of Marshall, gave notico that
he should ask that provision be inserted in
the Constitution to the tffct that when the
Coostitulioa it submitted to the people they
ball then determine wLether the name shall
be Western Virginia or Kanawha.
The Nftlional Hag now floats ovei the soil
of every secedod Stale except Alabama and
Arkansas. In Virginia it floats over one
third of the Slate; in North (Carolina, al llat
leras inlet; iu South Carolina, at Port lloyal
and a :.alf a dosn neighboring islands; in
Georgia, on Tybeo Islard ; in Floii la, at Key
Wtt, Santa ilosa Island, a-id olbr points;
in Mississippi, at Ship I-Uud; in Louid
ana, Cbandeleur Island; in Texas, al El
Pmm; and iu Tennessee, at Bristol Kliztbath
lon. and other oinU iu the eaa'.ero part of
the Stale.
A letter from Port Royal, published in the
New York Tribune, says Gen. Drayton, who
Cominuiided al Hilton Head, waa wounded
during the fight. Mid died during the ratreal.
This explains the thirteen minute guns
heard by the blockading vs els off Charles
ton, sboilly after the battle, the suras in
d testing the death of a Brigadier-Genen I.
Tbe majority lor Gov. Harvey, the new
Governor of Wisconsin, grows larger with
each return of the ( ffioisl voto. It is now
8,370, including the reported vote of ten
rountiea not given officially; and these art all
the countVs in the State, Solomon, for
Lieutenant Governor, will have at least 5,000
majority.

used it are this, they are polled aa to the con

it is a plain straight forward statement of the
affairs of the country aa far aa it goes'. Those
who looked fo a full explanation of what had
been done, nnd the course to be pursued I y
the Administration to put down the rebellion
are disappointed, as it might be expected they
would. The eober second thought would
convince any one, that il woul i be indiscreet
to publish to the world, rebels included, what
action would be ' taken in the future towards
them. We shall publish extracts from the
Secretaries reports, referred to in the message,
hereafter.

To the Edit r of the UJltdale Democrat:
'Mr. Koitor: The lattaumW. of the
HilUlaze County Democrat contains an ora
tion of the Hon, Horatio Seymour of Utica,
New Voik, delivered ou the 28fh of Oct. last
which ih Editor endorse and oommends it to
the careful perual of readers. It i perhaps
not the first iim when the endorser did not
add much to the raise or character of the ne
gotiable paper.' '
However, being on old Democrat and a
subset iler and Constant reader of the Demo
crut 1 bsv.' carefully read the speech aa the
Editor r quested, and I must say that it is
the strsnget and mixture of concealed secet
i nisiii and pseudo patriotism I - have ever
seen compounded togotlrr. There area
multitude of obnoxiojs features to the speech
which ( shall notico in subsequent communi
cations aa my leisure and your space will per
mit. ;
I will say, however, in passing that I can
not see how tbe Editor can publish that
speech, much lest endorse it without being re
garded aa sympathizing with this improvok
ed and inexcusable rebellion. i
What is the object of the Editor in pub
lishing that speech! What good did he ex
peel w nld be accomplished by it publica
tion I Who is there within the range of tbe
circulation of the Democrat that either need
ed or desired such counsel as is contained in
that speech! 1 wish the Editor would an
swer these questions without any mental res
ervation. Was il to prevent eulistmentat
My praent purpose is to call attention to th
following paragra which will be found tow
ards the clone of the speech. They may per
haps be considered ss the condensation of the
ideas of the Orator and disclono veiy clsarly
that he had more affection for his party than
love for his country.
But is' the prpoeition of our ItepuMiean, friends,
tint they Willi
rwill dissolve their organization, i
give up ouru, quite fair and equal?
and Hi at
we shall
Their
party U but a thing of yesterday.
It trrew out of
. ur wnole country within iu orjpuiietion. Its first
victory is associated with the ruin of our land. If
Uly wish to aUmloa itj it.Uhem doso, but let them
not attempt to cover mat atwnUunment i.y a pro
sal that we shall give up a party which is identified
with the greatness, the progress and the power of
our nation.
It has beon well said by one of our townsman,
that if aa American citizen returning from abroad
and ignorant of the eventa which have happened
wit tin the past two years, should hear that civil
war was raging here, his first exclamation would
be. Then the Democratic party was defeated at Ihe
last Presidential election! We believe that our
success at this time will strengthen the Union men
of the 8outli. AVe believe that the dissolution of
the Democratic party would discourage theiu. We
mean, therefore, to emulate the example of our
breathren in I'ensylvania, ind strive to place in
power not only a harmonious State administration,
out one that will hare the confidence of patriotic
men in every seetion of our country.
Tbe Editor, bear in mind is responsible as
ecdorser and must not find fault if he is held
to a rigid accountability, I will agree, how
ever to cancel the judgment if he will hon
estly testify and answer the following ques
tions. Who proposed to dissolve the Republican
Party if the Democrats would g:vo op theirs?
When was the proposition made and where I
What authority bad any individual or set of
individuals to make such a proposition!
Why do you say that the Republican party
grew out of a sectional paiou or piejudicet
Why did it not embrace the whole country
within its organizatio i f What fau't do you
find with the platform of the Republican
party as erected at Chicago t Why do you
say that its first victory is associated with the
ruin of our land! What act has tho Presi
dent done which jou can or do find fault
wilh!
If not the Democratic party is responsible
for this Rebellion! Did not the Democratic
party lect James Bucbanao and did he not
content to aud advocate the right of secession !
Io older to avoid being tedious, I will ex
press the hope that you will answer these
questions, and then you will hear from me io
a more direct shape. I regie t very much
that yon should have been so far forgetful
of the proprieties of life, aod the behests of
patriotic duly as to publish and endorse such
sentiments as a disappointed New York poli
cial was wont to ultor. This is no time to
criminate or recriminate. The very existence
of tha Government is in peril, and it bo
hooves every man who loves his country and
adores his God to forget past political strifes
and do all be can, socially, morally and po
litically, to preserve tin Union aa establish
ed by our forefathers. And I regard the
mm who would, either by writing, speaking
or (ublishing, attempt to distract the united
efforts of the Noilh as u secessionist in dis
guise, and therefore raorA contemptible than
one by instinct.
Were I deposed, I conld easily prove that
thia rebellion is a legitimate sequence of the
Democratic (o callod) Party, but I foibcar
so doing at this lime. I in common with
very many other have rejoiced at the re
markable unanimity with which the rank and
file of the Democratic Party have rushed at
call of the President to the staudard of their
couolrjand bavecbeerfully partaken of its for
tunes aod it fate,aod that they are now rtaly
whenever tbe occasion may call, to lake their
chances among those on whom the blows may
fall firrt and fall thickest. And I have
mourned over the humiliating truth that quite
anumler of Democratic politicians of intal
ligenco hate ever and anon n tiered sonti
menls wbicn clearly indicated that they at
lesat were traitors.
One word more: It is true the Rejubli-
can t'arty is in its mrancy but a thing or
yesterday. Yet why should its youth be
charged as a crime. Can youth be impule I
to any party a a crime! Whv was the
Democratic Parly divided and destroyed !
Was it not th' result of their own dimensions!
And did not the imWcility of the Democratic
Party generate the Republican Party I
Whether joulb can be imputed to any
party as a crime I shall not determine; but I
will say that an Id party may properly be
come an obi.-ct of contempt w ben it fails to
regard both precedent and principle. The
party which after having seen tbe consequen
ce of a thousand errors continue still to
blonder and whose aga has only added treason
to stupidity, is only an object of abhorenc
and contempt. JACKSON.

Editor 8tadard : All it quiet along
the Potomao to-night except now and then
n stray picket ia shot, at he walkt to and fro

thicket." O . ; i
"All is quiet along the Potomao to-night,"
so thought I, as I walked to and fro along
my beat last night, and within but a few
rods of a thicket of pines, not knowing but
that some stray scout, or bidden cavalry
man was there hidden within gun shot, and
peeting inio the daikncs to see that no ene
my was crawling near the lines. All was
quiet, except now and then, a stray shot was
fired, probably al some imaginary rebel, hid
iu tbe thicket. But sometimes there is a
real enemy lurking, and sometimes a picket
is shot when he least thinks of auch a thing,
or has for the Moment, turned his thoughts
to something else, than watching for an eno
ray. 4'hus a lesson U learned by others to
attend more closely to their duty, for the
safety of thousands who are asleep in their
tents, depending upon the fidelity of the
picket guard. Pickets are now sent out for
forty-eight hours, and a certain number are
stationed at aome hous, where the meu are
then divided up into reliefs, and relieved
every two hours, which cauoa a considerable
grumbling, and not unfrequently, sorno swear
ing by the men, who bad rather stand either
twelve or twenty four hour, which would be
much safer than relieving every two hours.
But as cold weather is mow upon us, and by
being relieved often prevents much suff-ring
from c: Id.
Our troops have not yet gone into winter
quarters, and I believe that it is the intention
of the President and General McClellau not
to let the soldiers go into winter quarters, 1 at
to hold th m in readiness for any emergency,
j aud it is b-lieved not only by the troops, but
by citizens throughout tins section ilini
'something will bo done before a great while."
All are anxioulj looking towards Congress to
do aomi'tbing that will hav a tendency to
quell or crowd the rebellion to a clone. The
Koldier as a general thing like the manner in
which Gen . Lane, of Kansn, and Col. Coth
ratio view the cause of ihe rebellion, and their
manner in crushing it, br "arming tho ne
groes" wl.euever it ia necessary or convenh nt
to do so.
Now and then aa occasi. nal rkirinitdi takes
place betwodn scouliog parlies of both Armies,
aod for a few day past the nemy have been
prowling rather too near our linen, and on
Sunday last, were in the woods scouting clo6
to our line of picket, but kept themselves
concealed. To-day four regiment have beuo
sent out reconnoitering, with the intention of
: diiving the enrmy back within his own lines.
They never allMck our troops without a very
aupeiior force, and then not iu a fair open
way, but from some thicket of pine, or from
a houe, or other building in which they can
.ciet themselves.
The gun-boat Hot IU upon the Poto.nac is
keeping the rebels at bay along the river, our
voHSid are constantly running their blockade,
K it can't be very strong.
We are hnving some very fine weather jut
a. present, very much unlike onr Mihigin
December weather. Y.
Military Truub'ra In .Michigan.
The Chandler II ne Guard', battalion
of 260 meu under Msjor William C. Hughes,
in Michigan, ba leeo muttered out of the
service by Cm pt. Mizuer, U. S. A., after hav
ing cost the Government $ 50.0UU. The ra
on for this wat that Mj r Hughes, finding
he could not continue io command, so myti
fiel the roll that il wa imoatible to gel out
of the entanglement ia any other way than
by disbanding. Tbe ioeu were sore displeas
ed, and one of tbe Captains (Fish) gave Ma
jor Hughe a thrashing with a rawhide well
laid on. This Hoghea ia a D.ijton Adven
ture, and came over here to Chicago, t
slimmer, with A company for &1. Mu'ligao's
regiment; which company stntshed up in
about the same way aa th battalion. We
hope he will sulfide now.
The 11th infantry rog-ment, Col. Win. J .
May recruited al White Pigeon, ha; also ben
the subject of much trouble. The regiment i
was commenced several months agi. and has
cost the Government about $150,000 already, i
with 150,000 morn to be added. The rai
ment is sai I to be under orders for Kentucky,
and it is well that il should be oil". There
aro 40Q on the nick list, and utile- the Uoow
are put into the field soon th rogiment will
he demor liz'd by sickness and discontfnt. -One
company, rmVd by Capt. Smith, as
fuilers, was dinbanded last week, because it
was fmind that Col, May had no auihorily to
attach such a company to bis command, anv
the men would not serve as infarlry.
The above is taken from tho Chicago Tri
bune of Tuesday lust The rcmaiks in regard
to Cut. May's Regiment in the main are no
doubt correct, but in error as regards the
large nuinbor stated to be tick. After accept
ing Cnpt. Smilh'a company of Fusiloers and
keeping them iu camp two or three months,
until tbe fad became known to them that
Col May had uo authority to attach ach a
company to the regimant; be endeavored to
muster them into infantry service, thus ox
posing bis real scheme. Failing in this he
informed the officer I hey would be Rccepted
and placed in a regiment at Fort Wayne, De
troit by the Adjutant Robertson at Fusilecn;
at the aame time reciting them to the Ad
jatact as a body of mn without ofBiors, or
any organization. This we understand is the
predicament the company found thmselves
in, upou their arrival at Detroit. Wo are
also inf"rml that after the company whs dis,
handed, Col. May, not satisfied with the in.
jury be h;i! already done lh! officers and men,
reported I the State Foard that the oflicors
were never sworn in; while they havo their
certificates wiih Col. Mat's own signature to
lite contrary . In this case tho Col. must out
do himsxlf in engineering, to make his asser
tions to the Brnrd correspond with his own
Certificates.
It it but justice to the Stat Mihiary
Board, to stale that tbey had oo control over
Major Hugho' iqaadroo and Col. May' Re

JHT The Washington correspondent of the
Chicago Tribune, of yesterday aay:
Secretary Chase's Report is finished, and
it will be sent to Congress to morrow. It is
aaid to contain a more profound and origoal
discussion of financial questions than any
Treasury Report made for year. He esti
mates the Public Debt in 1863, at the pres
ent rates of expenditure, at eight hundred
milion dollars. He w' recommend a tax
upon promis ory notes and aUo upon bank
notes, in order to remove them from circula
tion, and kubstitul) in their place currency of
the United States; alio tax deeds of fonvey
ance, d-crea-e duty upor. liquors aud tobMC
co, and increase lhoe upon lea, coffee and
sugar. The Uejort, in all, U about the same
length as Secretaty Camerou's.

From the Cincinnati Gazette, 4th.
The Senate adopted a resolution to enter
into joint conveutioii for the election of U. S.
Suialor, to succeed John C. lireckinridge, ou

Commonwealth of Kentucky, Tbst aj bit

pcially what increas in ihe military force,
if any, is required to uid the civil authorise
in ihe niHiuiunaiice of Uw end order, aud ihe
protection of the cit:znt iu their persons and

And the following, liich nny provo of
great benetii to (nn. Buell, i- piopsring hi"

Resolved by the General Atsanbly of the

While s arery ia titn peac, is undoubtedly
a souict of weakness to llid South there, is
as litllo boubt that thus far during the rebdl
ion il has proved lis lvroatost element of
strength. If slavery had uol existed lh
Confederacy" could not have furnished one
half the soldier they now have iu lh Oo 1 1.
This the rebel organs tinm-ielves admit. Wt
command to those who devote ih-f'nselvcs so
much more earex-s ly to the s.tcred rights of
property in into, and to (be obligations of
the Government lo secure to blave-holdin,'
reikis the protection of the laws and consti
tution, than they do to ihe persovation of the
Union, the followi g baasl of the Mobile
(Ala.) Advertiser:
"In any other country than our own, such
a draft could not e m a, but the Southern
States can furnish that number of iiiim, and
still not leave the material intern-Is of the
country in a sutforing condition. The insti
tution of slavery in the South alone, enalds
her to p!aM iu the field a force much larger
in piopotion to her while population than the
Nrth.or, indeed, than any other country
which is dependent entirely on tree labor.
The institution is a tower of strength to the
South, particularly iu the present crisis, and
our enemies will bo likely to find that the
'moral ca- cer.' about which their orators ar
so fond of prating is really one of the most
effective weapons employed against the Union
by the SoutL."

line of the ar-ny f the Potomac. Thi De
partinfitt uderslands that such pe'Sjns afier
wards comig into the city of Washington,
ar linbel te arrested by the ciiy police up
on the presumplion arising from color that
they aro fugauves from service or labor. By
the fotnth secesion of the act of Congress,
approved August Cth, 1801, entile! an act
to conniC' property used for insurrectionary
purMses, such employment is mad a full and
sufficient answer lo any further claims o sr
vice or labor. Persons thus employed and
escaping, are received into a militaiy protec
tion of the U. S,and their arrest as fugi
tives fsom labor or service, chould be im e
diaUily followed by the military arret of tbe
rart res inakinff the soixur. Ponies of this
communication will ba sent lo the Mayor of
the City of Washington, aod to th Marshal
of the District of Columbia. That any c-d-lisioo
