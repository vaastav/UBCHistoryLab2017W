Secretary Chase's Report.
Nsw Yoai, Dee. 9. The Secretory of tbe
Treasures report; after referring to recom
mendations contained in hla July report, gives
tne manner in which be obtained loans lor va
rious purposes of the Government The imme
diate exigencies were provided -for by swing
1140,019,034 In six per cent, two years' Treasu
ry notes, and $1,287,775 In same notes payable
lo sixtv davs. Ills next oare waa to provide for
disbqrsementt for the wari and ha adopted the
plan to engage tbe banking institutions or tne
three commercial eities ol the aeaboard to ad
vance tbe amount needed in loans tor mree
yeara' seven and three-tenth bonds, to be reim
bursed from proceeds of similar bonds subscribed
for bv the neoolo. honrne thus to combine the
capital of tho banka and tbP peopla with the
credit or tbe Government, so aa to give em
oiency to the Administration, notion and compe
tent eupport to tbe poblio orediti and tha result
has fulfilled tbe hope. " ' "
Ha' than rahaaraea tha a ornament entered In'
to between tbe banks and himself, by whloh the
former agreed to take the loans. The history
of the first two loans has been made public
Tbe third loan was negotiated with the banks
on the 16th of November, by which hp agreed
to Issue to them fifty millions In six per cent,
bonds at par for the bonds bearing seven three
tenths per cent. Interest. ,Tbls agreement was
coupled with no arrangement for reimburse
ments, and entailed no expense exoept for pre
paring and issuing tba bonds. Thia waa also
coupled with the option to the banka that on
or after the firat of January a fourth advance
oi titty millions sbould dp made on tne same
terma aa tbe first or second, If required.
In addition to these loans, Wi,MWM, op to
tbe 30th November, were Issued in Treasury
notes of fives, tens and twenties, payable on
demand, and $3,385,105 remaining in, . tha
Treasury. This amount may be regarded as a
loan from the people. The aggregate realized
from loans in various forms, Is $197,742,588.
Abe revenue receipts nave not fulfilled bis
expectations.' He says an aot modifying .tbe
rates of duties differed from tbe measure he
submitted to Congress, In most of these particu
lars, especially in diminished duties on tea,
coffee and sugar, and exempting goods in ware
houses and on shipboard. Tbe difference was
disadvantageous to the revenue, while a potent
tioloauseoC reduced receipts may be found lo.
tbo changed olroomitancea of the country prov
ing unfavorable to foreign commerce. These
circumstances compel him to reduce his eetl
mateefor lti63 from tbe revenue from $57,000,-
000 to $32,198,602. Tbe estimates from 're
ceipts from bonds and miscellaneous sources hs
reduces from $3,000,000 to $234,002. ,The
duly other sources of revenue la a direct tax au
thorized by Congress, which, if Increased to
the limits proposed by tho Secretary and as
sumed by tbe States the further sum of $20,
000,000 may be expected. , The aggregate of
revenue may bp thua eetlmated at $54,552
600 which is 126,447,334 less than the estimate
of July. . ( .... - i .
Too secretary states me estimates for July
were based on tbe raising of two hundred and
fifty thousand volunteered and tbe Inoreaso of
the regular arm? by eleven regiments; but after
that report bad been closed Congrats authorized
the aooeptence by the f resident ot nve bundred
thousand men, besides additional companies end
officers. 1 This large Increase bss and must neces
sarily augment tbe expend! turea far beyond the
limit indicated by the original estimates, which
will be still further extended by the increase of
tbe navy, and additional appropriations are
asked.. . .'... '. ,
Of these additional appropriations. $47,985.-
566 were authorized by acts of the last session
$14,313,097 are now asked for, making an ag
gregate, Including $22,787,933 for indefinite ap
propriations, ot iii,)si,vn .
To provide these large sums, retrenchment
and reform are indispensable. Contracts sbonld
be subjeoted to strict supervision, and contract
ors to rigorous responsibility j AH unnecessary
omees snouid do abonsned, and salaries and pay
materially reduoed." ''
While tbua reoommonding retrenchment, he
feels himself constrained to renew suggestions
heretofore submitted by him, that property of
rebels should be made to pay in part at least,
the coBt of the rebellion. Property of great
valna in loyal States is bold by proprietors vir
tually engaged In the gulity attempt to break
np tbe Union, which Is justly forfeited to the
people, whloh should be subject to sequestra
tion or confiscation, and tbo proceeds applied. to
the satisfaction of claims arising from the wsr.
Property of rebels In rebel States should be treat
ed In the same manner. Rights to services nnder
State laws must of. necessity form an exception
to any rnle of confiscation. Persons held bv
rebels under such lawa to service, as slavea.
may, however, be justly ' libsrated from their
constraint and made more valuable In various
employments, through voluntary and compen
sated service, then if confiscated as subjects of
property.
Tbe Secretary says the most sacred duty of
the American people now requires, tbe conse
cration of all their energise and resources to
the establisbmentf the Union, and sound pol
icy would seem to suggest no extension of for
eign trade, but more absolute reliance on
American labor, American akill and American
soil.' '' ' : -u.v !'-.-
He recommends that the duties on tea.' coffee
and sngar be increased to two and a half oenta
per pound on brown, three cents on olayed,
twenty cents on green tea, fire oenta oa coffee;
and that no other alterations of the tariff be
made unless further experience shall demon
strate tbe necessity. -, ,
lie deems it necessary to incrsase tbe direct
tax so as to produce from loyal Slates a reve
nue of at least $20,000,000, estimating such
duties on distilled liquors, tobacco, bank-notes,
carriages, legacies) on paper evidences of debt,
and conveyances of property, and other like
property as will produce an equal additional
sum. The income tat Will probably produce
$10,000,000 more, making an aggregate of
$50,000,000. , , . ,.
The Secretary is aware that tbe Bum is large.
but seeing no probability of revenue exceeding
f4.u,uvu,uuu . aunng ine current year, be feels
that he most not shrink from a plain statement
of the aetaal necessities of the situation. Two
fifths of one per cent, on the real and personal
property of the loyal States, will produce $44,.
000,000, the proposed income adding $10,000,-
000.
Thfl Secretary recommends a plan for a na
tional circulation of notes, . the features of
which are, a circulation of notea bearing a oom
mon Impression and authenticated by common
authority. The redemption of these notes by
assooiationa and institutions, to which they may
be delivered for Issue, and the security of that
redemption by pledge of United States' stocks,
and an adequate provision of specie. - An Im
portant advautage to tha people by this plan
would bs in tbe increased security of the Union,
springing from common interests in its pre
servation, created by distribution of its stocks
to associations throughout the country, aa the
basis of their circulation; and he entertains the
opinion, if a credit circulation be desirable, it ia
most oesirame in this torm.
He states that it ia earnestly hoped, not with
out sufficient grounds, that the present war will
bo brought to an auspicious termination Dolors
midsummer, and that in that event thp provi
sion of rsvenue by tbe taxation recommende.1,
will bP amply sufficient lor pit aaanotat exigen
cies, without additional loans, and enable tbe
Government at once to begin a reduction of the
existing debt. If tbe war dontwusa to July 1st.
1862, the publlo debt will bo $517,322,802; If
till July 1st, lobj, it win be, in round numbers,
$900,000,000. ..11,1,1-
Thp prohibition of trade 'with the i rebel
Statee has been fully enforced.1. 'Regulations

Bcnatc number of' petitions were pre
lented and referred te appropriate committees!
Several on. thp emancipation of tha alavea of
ine reoetat were proaraitvii bhh reiwrru w tus

relating to tbp recogpitton VI, Liberia ana Hay

committee on foreign Anairs-, Agreed to.
Mr. Ulark offered a resolution requesting tne
Marshal of tbe District to inform tba Senate by
what authority bo keeps alavea o! tbe District
in fall because tbev are refractorr. .
Up laid be bad visited the jail, and found a
rfumber of slavea of -the District confined there
for - no reason except' that their masters and
mistresses bad pent tbeaa there because tbey
were refractory.' ' k i -
Resolution agreed to. . , t
Mr. Ball's resolution dlreotiog tbe Judiciary
committee to inquire Into the expediency of
abolishing, the present Supreme Court and - es
tablishing another, was taken up. He said tbe
present Supreme Court bsd failed. He believed
u tne rebels now u anna ebould succeed, tbe
Supreme Court, would deoide that tbe soldiers
now in Virginia were trespassers and rioters.
Mr. Collamer moved as a substitute that tbe
portions of the President's message relating to
me Judiciary be relerred to the Judiciary com
mlttee. '
Mr. Lollamer's amendment wai agreed to,
and tbe resolution aa amended was adopted.
On motion of Mr. Chandler the reaolution in
quiring into- the cause ef tbp disasters to our
army at Hull Kun and Ball's Bluff, was taken
np- . '-. i i r, i
Tbe question was' on tbe substitute offered by
Mr. Grimes, that a eommlttse be appointed to
Investigate the causa of all the disasters that
have happened to the Union forces.,
Mr. Chandler: said officers of the army weie
not iiaoie to -impeachment, but one of our own
number has fallen (Mr. Baker), and nobody to
blame.. He tboogbt the facta ought, to be
known regarding tbe diaasters in Mieeourl, re
ferred to by the Ben a tor from Kanssr:If Gsn.
Fremont Is to blame, let it be known. If not,
In God's nams let him be justiflsd nd let tbe
country know It.. .
Mr. Foster thought Itbsst net to investigate
tbe oubieot now. Uoder the cresent circum
stances, he thought Congress had better cot do
it. If military officers msnaged tbe army bad
ly, Congress would only make a bad matter
worse by interfering, , lie would let the tmlita.
ry alone in time of war. An inquiry of this
kind would ooly oall mea away from higher du
ties. At tbe proper time Congress might make
tbe Inquiry. . - -
Mr. Sherman believed sn Invest mtlnn ernnW
be beneficial, especially a general Inquiry Into
win wuuie cunuuot 91 me ar, and said he
would record his solemn conviction that before
tbe war ceased slavsry would almost if not en
tirely cease to extet;'but the war should be car
tied 00, without any reference to the-subject of
slavery, to preserve a free country for free men.
If be could infuse the spirit of tbo people Into
