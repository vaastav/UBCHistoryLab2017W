New York, Dec. 2. Kef lectins the
lunusual and diverse even's which in
fluenced its course,, the session of the
stock exchange today was dull with
many contusms and irregular changes
or prices.
Adoption by the government of
stringent regulations to prevent a coal
litnwie, anoiner collapse in foreign
exchange, the sudden death of H. C.
trick and the president's message to
congress augmented the uncertainties
which .previously bad, obscured the
financial horizon. ;,
As a. market factor the president's
communication took precedence. Dis
appointment was expressed in many
'Quarters at the absence of specific ref.
erence to remedial railroad leglsia-,
lion. This was pajtly offset by reo!
Ommendatlons for thu protection of
various home Industries. -'
latest aspects, of the Mexican situ
tlbn,. which were distinctly beneficial
to the oil. shares and the 6 per cent
call money rate,-which held through
out the session, were almost the only
developments which favored trading j
and these, lost some .of thoir force In
the 'later-;doalinBs.,. TUb,. close. Was;
steady to firm. (Sales amounted to;
8"5',0OO shares. '
(In the bond market, where dealings
in 'Liberty Issues, were again large on1
a, declining .tendency, the noteworthy
feature was., the strength of local!
tractions. International bonds re-1
fleeted only moderately the further!
demoralised movement in exchange. I
Total sales, par value, aggregated
"$28,750,000. Old United States bonds
were unchanged on call.

owing to shortage of coal and to lack

cause of severe breaks In foreign ex
