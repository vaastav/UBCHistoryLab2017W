whllo the expenses were nearly $5,000 for

Neither tho president nor tho house com

of the Kntlonnl Liberal federation, com
prising delegates from overy liberal nnd
radical association In the country, as
sembled nt Derby on Wednesday to discuss
the "war. Nearly COO delegates attended.
Liberal Imperialism was snowed under. It
wns a startling revelation of a change of
feeling on tho war, for when tho same
body met In August tho nntl-wnr party was
In the minority.
Resolutions wero adopted nt Derby dp
mandlng that tho cabinet send a spcclnl
commissioner to South Africa to concludo
pence, thnt Mllner bo recalled nnd con
demning tho concentration camps and the
martial law. Less than fifteen delegates
representing liberal Imperialism voted
against theso sweeping declarations of
policy.
Unabated confidence was voted In Sir
Henry Campbell Dannerman. This action
by tho official representatives of tho liberal
cnucus Is n clear notice to Asqulth nnd Sir
Edward Grey and other liberal ex
ministers who approve the war to submit
or quit.
It depends chiefly on Roaebery whothor
there shall be a liberal Imperialist session
Ho will speak next Thursday at Chester
field. His views aro nlwnys moro or less
In a stnto of flux and his attitude in tho
present phase of tho war Is unknown.
UeiKiiincea Concentration On nip
"Oulda" has Issued this vigorous de
nunciation of tho Ilrltlsh concentration
camps In South Africa: "I havo no hesita
tion In declaring thnt I consider tho con
centration camps and the whole treatment
of tho non-combatants, the women and
children especially, as most brutal nnd
most unwise on the part of tho Brlttsh
government, for, united to the Intention
professed by them to destroy- tho eutiro
race nf Doers, it bears tho most Inhuman
significance and If Great Ilrltaln Is invaded
successfully hy a foreign foo It1' jeitnln
iljut. a .similar,. meftisure' wilt be meted out
to tho British population."
Tho press Is expressing much alarm at
the trade outlook for the winter. Tho
stagnation consequent upon tho protracted
war Is making Itself seriously felt nnd Is
Intensified by tho effects of American com
petition. Tho Northampton boot trndo Is
almost at n standstill. Distressing accounts
are published of terrible privations the
operatives aro already undergoing. This
undoubtedly Is due nB much to American
competition ns to tho recurring wave of
commercial dopre-sslon now passing ovor
Europe and cnuslug such a serious condi
tion of things, especially In Germany.
Tho building trade, tho staple Industry of
London, Is In even u worse utnto than tho
boot trade, nnd vnst hordes of nrtlsans
engaged In the numerous nllled trades aro
thrown out of work. Tho mass of the un
employed In the East End already Is as
suming serious dimensions,
Prefer Starvation (o Army.
Yet, strangely enough, tho young men
nppcar to prefer starvation to enlisting In
the nrrr.y, tho recruiting returns showing
no advanco proportionate to tho growing
number of men out of work. Tho iron
trado in the Midlands and north of Eng.
land (Is falling off rapidly. So Is the tin
trado In Wales. Even shipbuilding, which
has withstood tho slump longest, now li
decidedly slackening.
In the West End of London tho trades
men complain that thoy arc having the
worst Christmas bcason In many years. Th
milliners and dressmakers nro the most
seriously hit, but the depression extends to
all, branches of business, epectnlly tbosv
concerned with luxuries.
Robert P. Porter, regarded here as one
of the leading American statisticians', bns
opened nn office in York houso, Norfolk
street, with tho Statistical library, tor tho
purpose of providing Information on Amcr
lean commerce and industry for the Eng
lish press nnd public. This Information
burenu will be of great service to business
nion In London. No information Is to be
had at tho embassy or tho consulate here
about commercial matters In the United
States. At neither placo has thero been
received either tho peace treaty with Spain,
signed In 1898, or the Cuban constitution,
adopted last June, though many English
and American business men aro Inquiring
for theso and other documents affecting
International relations.

BERLIN, Dec. 7. Tho tariff bill goes to
tho committee uoxt week und nobody ex
pects Its reappearance for months. Hor-
ren Rebel nnd lllchter nnd other opposition
leaders have agreed to delay tho measure
as long ns possible In committee. Thoy
nro determined to rnako n fight on every
ono of tho 010 items. This well-worn form
of parliamentary obstruction Is to bo con
tinued In the house after It leaves tho com
mittee nnd tt is qutto possible that the
final vote will not bo reached until 1903,
unless the government offers n compromise,
which Is unlikely. Tho government, being
nwnro or tho dilatory tactics ntican, is
considering changing the rules of tho houso
so ns to block tho obstructive tactics of
the opposition.
A variety of estimates of tho majority
for or against tho bill nro In calculation.
The general Impression Is thnt the gov
ernment commands a largo majority. It
is not tho United Stntcs that tho govern
mont would bo concerned nbout, should
tho tariff bill be put through In Its prea
cnt form, but Russia and Austria-Hungary
It Is tho belief of tho foreign ofilcers that
Germany Is well nblo to uphold her sido
should tho United States make reprisals
Sinn of He nimiiile War.
Russia and Austria-Hungary havo already
Informed Germany that they aro not will
ng to negotiate commercial treaties on
the basis of the ponding tariff. These notl
flcatlons aro considered equivalent to tho
declaration of nn economic war, In which
tho broad markets now open to Germany
will Immediately bo closed nnd the consid
erable volume of United Stntcs products
now finding Its way to Russia through
German traders would In consequence bo
excluded with German goods.
Tho manager of tho American Tool com
pnny s worKs in Berlin has made n re
markable comparison of tho wages paid and
cost of tools mndo here with tho wages
paid and cost of tools nt the American
works, both sots of laborers using Identical
machines. Ho finds that the American
Workman, making nn exact allowance for
tho difference In wages, turns out a clear 2:
per cent more product for the same unit
of wages. Man for man tho German pro
duces two-tlfths of whnt an American docs
Ainerlenn Workmen Are .Superior.
A ehoo fnctory at Hreslnu using Ainerl

Tho American lusuranco companies which

thnt tholr concessions may be withdrawn

signed to tho commltteo on Intcroccnulo
