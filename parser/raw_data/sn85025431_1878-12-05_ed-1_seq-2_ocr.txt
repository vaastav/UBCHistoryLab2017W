former slave-holding states accepted these
constitutional freedom and protection which
obtained in all the other states of the
Union. The Iriends ot law and order
looked forward to the conduct of these elec­
tions, as offering to tbe general judgment
ot the country an important opportunity to
measure the degree in which the right of
suffrage could be exercised by the coloied
people, and would be respected by their
fellow-citizens but a more general enjoy­
ment of freedom of suffrage by the colored
people, and a m®re just and generous
tions prescribed by law,to oast one unintimi
dated ballot, and to have bis ballot honestly
countcd. So long as the exercise of this
power and the enjoyment of this right are
common and equal, practically as wqll as
formally, submission to the results of the
sutlrage will be accorded loyally and cheer­
fully, and all the departments of govern­
ment will leel the true vigor, of the
popular will thus expressed. No tempo­
rary or administrative interests of gov­
ernment, however urgent or weighty,
will ever displace the zeal of our
people iu defense of the primary rights of
citi/.euship. They understand that the pro­
tection of liberty requires the mainten­
ance, iu full vigor, of the manly methods of
free speech, free press, and free sutlrage,
aud will sustain the full authority of gov­
ernment to enfore the laws which are
framed to preserve these inestimable rights.
The material progress and welfare of the
states depend on the protection a Horded to
their citizens. There can be no peace
without Jsuch protection, no prosperity
without peace, and the whole country is
deeply interested in the growth aud pros­
perity ©f all its parts
While the country has not yet reached
complete uuity feeling and reciprocal
confidence between the communities so
lately and so seriously estranged, 1 feel an
absolute assurance that the tendencies are
in that directiou, und with iucreasing force.
The power of public opinion will override

It will be for the congress for which these
elections were held to make such examina­
tions into their conduct as may be appro­
priate to determine the validity of the
claims of members to their seats. In the
meanwhile it becomes the duty of the exec­
utive and judicial departments of the gov­
ernment, each in its province, to inquire
into and punish violations of the laws of
tire United S'ates which have occurred. I
can but repeat what I said in this connec­
tion in my last message, that whatever au­
thority rests with me to this end I shall not
hesitate to put forth, and I am unwilling to
forego a renewed appeal to the legislatures,
the courts, the executive authorities, and
the people of the states where these wrongs
have been perpetrated, to give their assist­
ance toward bringing to justice the offend­
ers and preventing a repetition of the
crimes. No means within my power will
be spared to obtain a full and fair investi­
gation of the alleged crimes, and to secure
the conviction and just punishment of the
guilty.
It is to be observed that the principal ap­
propriation made for the department of
justice at the last session contained the fol­
lowing clause And for defraying the ex­
penses which may be incurred in the en­
forcement of the act approved February 28,
1871, entitled, 'An act to amend an act
approved May 30, 1870, entitled an act to
enforce the rights of citizens of the United
States to vote in the several states of the
Union, and for other purposes,' or any acts
amendatory thereof or supplementary
thereto."
It is the opinion of the attorney general
that the expenses of these proceedings will
largely exceed the amount which was thus
provided, nnd I rely confidently upon con
throughout the whole country, Each state,
tection of that freedom by tbe communities
of which they form a part, were generally
anticipated than the record of the elections
discloses. In some of those states in which
the colored people have been unable to
make their opinions felt in the elections, the
result is mainly due to influences not easily
measured or remedied by legal protection"
but in the states of Louisiana and South
Carolina at large, and in some particular Jeen opened and still continues between

A treaty looking to this end
of both governments is now in operation,

Since the resumption of diplomatic rela­
tions with Mcxico, correspondence has
questions which at one time seemed to en­
danger their relations. While no formal
agreement has been reached as to the
troubles on the border, much .s been done
to repress and diminish them. The effect­

Rio Grande, by a strict nnd faithful com­

of Mexican troops on the other side of the
river is also making an energetic move­
ment against the marauding Indian tribes.
This government looks with the greatest
satisfaction upon every evidence of strength
in the national authority of Mexico, and up­
on every effort put forth to prevent or to
punish incursions upon our territory. Re­
luctant to assume any action or attitude in
the control of these incursions, by military
movements across the border, not impera­
tively demanded for the protection of the
lives and property of our own citizens, I
shall take the earliest opportunity consist­
ent with the proper discharge of this plain
duty to recognize the ability of the Mexican
government to restrain effectively viola­
tions of our territory. It is proposed to
hold next year an international exhibition
in Mexico, and it is believed that the dis­
play of the agricultural and manufacturing
products of the two nations will tend to
better understanding and increased com­
mercial intercourse between their people.
With Brazil and the Republic of Central
aud South America some steps have been
taken toward the development of closer
commercial intercourse. Diplomatic rela­
tions have been resumed with Columbia and
with Bolivia. A boundary question between
the Argentine Republic and Paraguay has
been submitted by those governments for
arbitration to the president of the United
States, and I have, after careful examina­
tion, given a decision upon it.
A naval expedition up the Amazon and
Madeira rivers has brought back informa­

about visiting the coast of Africa and the
Indian Ocean. The reports of diplomatic

The report of the Secretary of the Treas­
ury furnishes a detailed statement of the

finances.
The ordinary revenue from all sources
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, were

$20,799,551.90.
The receipts of the present fiscal year,
ending June 30, 1879, actual and estimated,
are as follows: Actual receipts for the

For the quarter commencing July 1, 1878,
actual expenditures, $73,344,573.27, and for
the remaining three quarters of the year the

NAVAL AFFAIRS.
The report of the secretary of the navy
shows that the navy has improved during
the last fiscal year. Work has been done
on seventy-five vessels, ten of which have
been thoroughly repaired, and made ready
for sea. Two others are in rapid progress
towards completion. The total expenditures

year,
peuses chargeable to the year, exclusive of
these deficiencies, were $13,306,914.09, or
$767,199.18 less than those of the previous
year, and $4,92S,677.74 less than the ex­
penses, includiug the deficiencies. The es­
timates for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1880, are $14,502,381.45—exceeding the ap­
propriations for the present year only $33,
949.75 which excess is occasioned by the
demands ot the naval academy and marine
corps, aB explained in the secretary's report.
The appropriations for the present fiscal
year are $14,528,431.70, which, in tbe opinion
of the secretary, will be ample for all the
current expenses of tbe department during
the year. The amount drawn from the
treasury from July 1 to November 1, 1878,
is $4,740,541.14, of which $70,980.75 has been
refunded, leaving as the expenditure for
that period $4,669,563.39, or $520,899.24 less
than the corresponding period of the last
fiscal year.
POSTAL AFFAIBS.
The report of the postmaster general em­
braces a detailed statement of the operations
of the postoffice department. The expendi­
tures o! that department for the fiscal year
ending June 3u, 1878, were $34,165,084.49.
The receipts, including sales of stamps,
money-order business and official stamps,
were $29,277,516.95. The sum of $290,
436.90, included in the foregoing statement
of expenditure?, is chargeable* to preceding
years, so that tne actual expenditures for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1878, are
$33,874,647.50. The amount drawn from
the treasury on appropriations, in addi­
tion to the revenues of the department,
was $6,307,652.82. The expenditures for the
fiscal year ending June SO, 1880, are esti­
mated at $36,571,900, and the reeeipts from
all sources at $30,664,023.90, leaving a defi­
ciency to be appropriated out. of the treas­
ury of $5,907,876.10. The report calls atten
tion to the fact that the compensation of
postmasters and of all railroads for carrying
the mail is regulated by law, and that the
failure of congress to appropriate toe
amounts required for the purposes does
not relieve tne government of responsibility,
but necessarily increases the deficiency
bills which congress will be called upon to
paws.
In providing for the postal service, the
following questions are presented: Should
Congress annually appropriate a sum for its
expenses largely in excess of its revenues,
or should such rates of postage be estab­
lished as will make the department self-sus­
taining? Should the postal service be re­
duced by excluding froin the mails matter
which does not pay its way? Should the
number of post-routes be diminished?
Should other methods be adopted which will
increase the revenue or diminish the ex­
penses of the postal service
The international postal congress, which
met at Paris May 1,1868, and continued in
session until June 4 of the same year, was
composed of delegates from nearly all the
civilized countries of the world. It
adopted a new convention to take the place
of the treaty concluded at Berne, October 9,
1874, which goes into eflect on the 1st of
April, 1879, between the countries whose
delegates have signed it. It was ratified
and approved, by aud with the consent of
the president, August 13, 1878. A synopsis
of this universal postal convention will
be found in Ihe report of the post­
master general, ana the full text
in the apjjendix thereto. In its origin
the postal union comprised twenty
three countries, having a population of
350,000,000 of people, aud will soon, by the
accession of tlie few remaining countries
and colonics which maintain organized

Some embarrassment has arisen out of
the conflict between the customs laws of
between 18(J2and the close of the last' convention in regard to the trans
a a
to this country by mail. It is hoped that
congress will be able to devise some means
of reconciling the difficulties which have
thus been created, so as to do justice to all
parties involved.
THE JUDICIARY.
The business of the Supreme Court, aud
of the courts in mauy of the circuits, has
increased to such an extent during the past
years that additional legislation is impera­
tive to relieve and prevent the delay of jus­
tice, and tbe possible oppression to suitors
which is thus occasioned. The encumbered
condition of these dockets is presented
anew in the report of the attorney general,
and the remedy suggested is earnestly urged
for congressional action. The creation of
additional circuit. judges, as proposed,
would aflord a complete remedy, and would
involve an expense—at the present rate of
salaries—of not more than $60,000 a year.
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
The annual reports of the secretary of the
interior and of tne commissioner of Indian
affairs, present an elaborate account of the
present condition of the Indian tribes, and
of that branch of the public service which
ministers to their interests. While the con­
duct of the Indians, generally, has been
orderly, and their relations with their
neighbors friendly and peaceful, two local
disturbances have occurred, which were de-
plorable in their character, but remained,
I happily, confined to a comparatively small

notwithstanding they have uniformly

of the interior and the
of war unite in the rlcommenda-
tion that provision be made by congress
for the organization of a corps of mounted
Indian auxiliaries," to be under the con­
trol of the army, and to be used for the pur­
pose of keeping the Indians on their reser­
vations and preventing repressing dis­
turbance on their part. I earnestly concur
in this recommendation. It is believed that
the organization of such a body of Indian
cavalry, receiving a moderate pay from the
government would considerably weaken the
restless element among the Indians by with­
drawing from it a number of youDg men
and giving them coneenial employment
under the government, it being a matter of
experience that Indians in our service
almost without exception are faithful in the
performance of the duties assigned to them.
Such an organization would materially aid
the army in the accomplishment of a task
for which its numerical strength is sorae-
But whiJe the empioyirient
of force for
troubles is of occasional necessity, and wise
preparation should be made to that end,
greater reliance must be placed on humane
and civilizing agencies for the ultimate so­
lution of what is called the Indian prob­
lem. It may be very difficult, and require
much patient effort, to curb the unruly
snirit of the savage Indian to the restraints
of civilized life, but experience shows that
it is not impoEsible. Many of the tribes
which are now quiet and orderly and self
supporting were once as savage as any that
at present roam over the plains or in the
mountains of the far west, and were then
considered inaccessible to civilizing influ­
ences. It may be impossible te raise them
fuily up to the level of the white population
of the United States but we should not for­
get that they are the aborigines of the coun­
try, and called the soil their own on which
our people have grown rich, powerful and
happy. We owe it to them as a moral duty
to help them in attaining at least that de­
gree of civilization which they may be able
to reach. It is not only our duty—it is also
our interest to do so. Indians who have
become agriculturists or herdsmen, and feel
an interest in property, will thenceforth
cease to be a warlike and disturbing ele­
ment. It is also a well-authenticated fact
that Indians are apt to be peaceable and
quiet when their children are at school, and
I am gratified t: know, from the expressions
of Indians themselves and ty-om many con­
curring reports, that there is a steadily
increasing desire, even among Indians
belonging to comparatively wild tribes, to
have their children educated. I invite at­
tention to the reports of the secretary of the
interior and the commissioner of Indian
affairs, touching the experiment recently
inaugurated, in taking fifty Indian children,
boys and girls, from different tribes, to the
Hampton Normal Agricultural Institute, in
Virginia, where they are to receive an ele­
mentary English education and training in
agriculture and other useful work, to be re­
turned to their tribes, after the competed
course, as interpreters, instructors and ex­
amples. It is reported that the officer
charged with the selection of those children
might have had thousands of young In­
dians sent with him had it been possible to
make provision for them. I agree with the
secretary of the interior in saying that
the result of this interesting experiment,
if favorable, may be destined to become an
important factor in the advancement of
civilisation among the Indians."
The question whether change in the
control of the Indian service should be
made, was, at the last session of congress,
referred to a committee for inquiry and re­
port. Without desiring to anticipate that
report, I venture to express the hope that
in the decision of so important a question,
the views expressed above may not be lost
sight of, and that the decision, whatever it
may be, will arrest further agitation of this
subject, such agitation being apt to produce
a disturbing effect upon the serviee, as well
as on the Indians themselves.
HOT SPBIHOS COK1CI88ION.
In tlie enrollment of the bill making ap­
propriations for sundry civil expenses, at
the last session of congress, that portion
which provided for the continuation of
the Hot Brings commission was omitted.
As the commission had completed the work
of taking testimony on the many conflicting
claims, the suspension of their labors, be
for determining the rights of claimants,
threatened [for a time to embarrass the in­
terests not only of the government but alse
of a large number of. the citizens of Hot
Spring?, who were waiting for final action
on their claims before beginning contem­
plated improvements. In order to prevent
serious difficulties which were apprehended
and at the solicitation of manyleading citi
cens of Hot Springs and others interested in
the welfare of the town, the secretary of
the nterior was authorized to request the
late commissioneis to take charge of the
records of their proceedings, and to per­
form such work as could properly be done
by them under such circumstances to facili­
tate the future adjudication of the claims at
an early day, and to preserve the status of
the claimants until their rights should be
finally determined. The late commission
eis complied with that request, and report
that the testimony, in all cases, has been
written out, "examined brifed, and so ar­
ranged as to facilitate an early setelement
when authorized by law. It is recommended
that the requisite authority be given at as
early a day in the session as possible, and
that a fair compensation be allowed the late
commissioners for the expenses incurred
aud the labor performed by them since tne
25th of June last.
TIMBBE LANDS.
I invite the attention of congress to the
recommendation made by the secretary of
the interior with regard to the preservation
of the timber on the public lands of the
United States. The protection of the pub­
lic property is one ot the first dutie.- of the
government. The department of the in
forests is an evil fraught with the gravest
improvement of the harbor of Washington
and Georgetown, is respectfully commended,
to consideration.
The report of the commissioners of toe Lns
tmt of Columbia presents a detailed state-
ment of the affairs of the District.
The relative expenditures by the United
States and the District for losal purposes is
cotrasted, showing that the expenditures by
the people of the District
terior should, therefore, be enabled by sufli-1 opinion as to its successful operation-, but the
eieut appropriations to enforce the laws in practical results already attained are so sat:s

consequences, especially in the mountain­
ous districts, where the locky slopes, once
denuded of their trees, will remain so for­|

be repaired. I fully concur with the secre­!
tary of the interior in the opinion that for
this reason legislation touching the public
timber in the mountainous states and terri­
tories of the west should be especially well
considered, and that existing laws, in which
the destruction of the forests is not suf-1

From the organization of the government EXpended during tbe year for mail transpor
the importance of encouraging, by all possi-jtation
individual or
tional welfare, agriculture is of primary
importance. In proportion as nations ad­
vance in population and other circumstances
of maturity, this truth becomes more ap­
parent, and renders the cultivation of
the soil more and more an object of public
patronage. Institutions for promoting it
grow up, supported by the public purse
and to what object can it be dedi­
cated with greater propriety Among
which have been employed

periment, and by drawing to a common
center the results"everywhere of individual
skill and observation, and spreading them
thence over the whole nation. Experience
accordingly hath shown that they are very
cheap instruments of immense national'
benefit."
The great preponderance of the agricul­
tural over any other interest in the United
States entitles it to all the consideration
claimed for it by Washington. About one
half of the population of the United states
is engaged in agriculture. The value oi the

port of the bureau of statistics, were $524.
000,000. The great extent of our country,
with its diversity of soil and climate, enables
us to produce within our own borders, and
by our own labor, not only the necessaries
but most of the luxuries that are consumed
in civilized countries. Yet, notwithstand­
ing our advantages of soil, climate and in­
tercommunication, it appears from the
statistical statements in the report of the
commissionei of agriculture, that we im­
port annually from foreign lands many
millions of dollars' worth of agricultural
products which could be raised in our own
country.
Numerous questions arise in the practice
of advanced agriculture which can only be
answered by experiments, often costly and
sometimes fruitless, which are beyond the
means ol private individuals, and are a just
and proper charge on the whole nation for
the benefit of the nation. It is good policy,
To education more than to any other

desire to repeat the suggestion contained
in my former message in behalf of the en­

with national aid, the local systems of edu­

Adequate accommodations for the great
library, which is overgrowing the capacity
of the rooms now occupied at the capitol,
should be provided without further delay.
This invaluable collection of books, manu­
scripts and illustrative art, has grown to
such proportions, in eonnection with the
copyright system of the country, as to de­
mand the prompt and careful attention of
congress to save it from injury in its pres­
ent crowded and insufficient quarters. As
this librajy is national in'its character, and
must, from the nature of the case, increase
even more rapidly in the future than in tbe
past, it cannot be doubted that the people
will sanction any wise expenditure to pre­
serve it and to enlarge its usefulness.
The appeal of the regents of the Smith­
sonian Institution for the means to organ­
ize, exhibit and make available for the pub­
lic benefit the articles now stored away
belonging to the national museum, I
heartily recommend to your favorable con­
sideration.

OF COLUMBIA.
The attention of congress is again invited to
the condition of the river-front of the city of
Washington. It is a matter of vital import­
ance to the health of the residents of the na­
tional capital, both temporary and permanent,
that the low lands in front of the city, now
subject to tidal overflow, should be reclaimed.
In their present condition, these flats obstruct
the drainage of the city, and area dangerous
source of malarial poison. The reclamation
will improve the navigation of the river, by re­
stricting and consequently deepening its chan­
nel and ig also of importance, when consider­
ed in connection with the extension of the
public ground and the enlargement of the
firt, west and sonth of the Washington Mon­
ument. The report of the board of survey,

the requisite repair of the defective pave­
ments and sewers of the city, which is a wcrk
of immediate necessity, and,"in the same con­
nection, a plan is presented for ihe permanent
funding of the ouv.ta.udiug securities of the
District.
The benevolent, reformatory and penal in­
stitutions of the District are all entitled to the
favorable attention of congress. The reform
school needs additional buildings and teach­
ers. Appropriations which will place all of
these institutions in a condition to become)
models ol' usefulness and beneficence, will be
regarded by the country as liberally and wisely
!e»towed.
The coinifliBsieners, with evident justice, re­
quest ?.ttentiou to the discrimination made by
congress against the District in the donation

and ask that the same liberality that has been,

A considerable portion of the report is
devoted to the subject of the present aud
prospective deficiencies in the amounts aj-
for railway tram-portion. In
regard to the postmasters' salaries, he says
the deficiencies or prevention of them, so
far as salaries and compensation of post­
masters are concerned, are not and cannot
be controlled by the department. If the
amount appropriated by congress for the
purpose be not equal to the amount of com­
pensation established by law, there must be.
a deficiency.

consider the public interest injured thereby.
In regard to the revenues of the postal
service, the postmaster general says:
'•'Time and again it has been shown that
matter of the second and third class does
not pay its way through tbe mails, and con
cress has been urged to increase the rates
thereon. The question has been considered,
time and time again by appropriate com­
mittees, and discussed in botn branches of
congress, and the results have shown that it
was not expected that the department
should be self-sustaining, but that the de­
ficiencies in its revenues should be xaet by
appropriations from tlie general treasury.
The amount of matter sent through the
mailt free is very large, adding greatly to
our expenditure and givirgus no revenue."
Postmaster General Key prote.-ts against
the revival of the worst features of the
franking privilege. The free list is such,
he says, that almost everything except let­
ters can now be iranked which ever could
be, and it was precisely thatkind of luggage
which the abolition of the frank aimed at
throwing out. Tons upon tons of boc ks,
documents, seeds, shrubs and the like are
"dead-headed"'from Washington all over
the country.
RIVERS A"1 HARBORS.
The aunual report of Gen. A. A. Hum­
phreys, chief of engineers, is devoted
mainly to the two subjects of fortifications
and river and harbor "improvements. It is
shown that, during tbe fiscal year ending
June SO, the sum of $2.794.4S3 was expended
for the improvement of river? and harbors,
and a balance of $l,6i ^,C7S. remaining from

The old charter which was granted to

is handsomely carved, the figures repre­
senting oak leaves and acorns. On the
top are crossed bars of oak bearing the
Connecticut coat-of-arms carved intaglio,
with the motto in gilded letters. In the
old frame, which was in mahogony, tbe
charter was in sections, but now it is as
if a single sheet. The color of the text
had become so faint as to make it almost
indecipherable in places, but Mr. Horace
Heath, the engrosrer employed in the
office, has by means of Indian ink
brought out the color so that it can be
easily read. When Dean Stanley was
visiting the city recently, he pronounced
the likeness of Charles II. on the top of
the document as comparing exactly with
likenesses in England, which are said to
be correct. The glass is a heavy French
plate, and the backing of the frame so
accurately put in as to make it air-tight,
thus making it perpetual. On the upper
left-hand corner the paper shows two
stains which it received while concealed
in the tree. In the charter Connecticut
has what no other state in the union can
boast oi.—Hartford Evening Post.
Lamartme's Unpublished Flay.
The late Bishop Dupanloup is said to
have been the possessor of an unpub­
lished tragedy in five acts by Lamartinel
When young, be happened once to be
staying in the same house with the poet,
who one evening read aloud this tragedy
to their hosts. These hosts were people
opposed to the rising Romantic move­
ment, and the influence was so apparent
in the work that they counseled Lamar
tine not to publish it. He left the manu­
script on the table that night, and next
morning, concluding to follow their ad­
vice, destroyed it, saying that he had no
other copy. The young Dupanloup,
however, was so impressed by tne poem
that he bad crept down stairs at night
and copied the whole of it. Lamartine
is said to have never known of the ex­
istence of this copy.
