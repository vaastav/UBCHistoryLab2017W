Mr. Carnegie's Latest Proposition.
AndrewOarnegie has the greatest philanthropic
scheme on of the twentieth century, and possibly
the greatest of its kind in the history of the world
Ha proposes to create a fund of $10,000,000, for the
founding of a scientific institution at Washington*
and for the pay ii)nnt of the expenses of American
students encaged in original investigations at home
and abroad. He will mike this fund a gift to the
nation. President Roosevelt and his cabinet of
ficers arc uow considering I be offer and tlio atten
tion i.f ongre.-s will likelv be called to it by a
special message from tlif? President. The idea is
to establish a national university which shall he
under the supervision of the government. Post
graduate instruction will be given.
Mr. Carnegie's olfer is not of as much magni
tude as some endowments that h.ive been nude in
this country in point of tho amount of money, a
single individual having given !ji|{0 U00 000 to tho
big California university, but is or far greater im
portance because of the benefits to the f?eneral
public it carries wit It it. Such an institution would
aironl higher and greater opportunity to all in the
pursuit of knowledge, anil the knowledge acquired
bein1,- beyond that in the regular educational insti
tutions would lesultin grand scientific possibilities.
With such an institution in successful opera
tion, the great philanthropist, who s.mv fromk a
poor boy to bo a multimillionaire and who regards
it "'a crime to die rich," would doubtless give it far
more liuanci,il sunpori. which, together with the
pride our national legislature would take in it,
W ill Id make it tin institution, whose momentous
ness can not be conceived. Such an undertaking
would stir tiie educations! circles of the world and
attract a degree of admiration far greater than the
big things Amcrica has sprung upon the civil zed
world already this century.His to lie hoped congress
will hive no hesitancy in accepting the gift and
that the foundation may he laid for a century of
science,
t
Ours The Largest And Best.
An an undisputed evidence u! the prosperity
and thrift prevailing in one ;,f n,< Lreliest citios

of the ahsolu'P necessity of such a v >i11;uii. . ,

the advertisements the buying public rnav I'c-! c
sured that all holiday wants can le sup,.I e>i
Clarksburg and none need ?o elsewhere to make
their purchases. The merchants have fai'hfuliv
and at great expense laid before the people the in
ducements they have to olTiir and have invested a
great deal of money in new go-ids. They mean to
do business with you and to serve you riirh t. We
hope this year's holiday trade may be the largest
and best they have ever had. Read whit they
have to say to you.
Andrew Kdmiston. of Weston, is disgusted at
the suggestions made that lie will be the next
democratic nominee in this district for congress,
and he flat footedly denies that his name will o
used or is even thought of in that connection. He
6ays he is out for business these days and has quit
politics. That is what all business men of the
democratic party say. when they are tendered the
congressionol nomination in this district. They
are satisfied to let well enough alone and realize
that the full dinner pail means plenty of business,
Andy has proven himself no exception.
Papers like nil other business to be successful
must be run on a business basis and there is roth
iog so near that sort of a basis, as prompt cash pay
ments of subscription. Pdy up, if yon can, by the
first of the year.
A Brute's Awful Act
The business men and others on Third street
ware horrified J/onday night at the sight of a dog
running at fall HDeed down the street with a big
ball of dame blitzing forth from bis hind quarters.
The anitn<l was in tbe most excruciating pain.
Whitfcer he came or whither he went no oae seems
to know. There is every evidence, however, that
some one indalgnd in the brntality of saturating
tbe dcg's hair with oil and applying fire to it. The
sight was repulsive to the feelings of humanity,
and even ihe thought of it sickens tbe heart. The
perpetrator of this cruel deed may have done it
unthoughtedly, and we feel sure that the result of
his own miss-deed will teach him never to indulge
in it again. The awful scene will cling in all its
horror to the memory of all who witnessed it and
none of them will even trifle that way with nn in
uocetit brute. Burning at the stake could scarcely
be more say age. The case is one dotnundiiigNbe
immediate attention of Ibe authorities and the
hunt should not cease until the wretch is in de to
answer for his crime, although we bave lot.-tliu
slightest doubt that his conscience gives him Die
torture of hell. Still,'.here ought to ba u public
example made out of his cise.* A most tu 'nUlu
case is tins tor our humane society ai.d r. i> n.pi-o
its members will leave no stone unturned to briiij*
punishment upou the perpetrator.
For the sake of our civilization it i| to lie trust
ed there is not another like him ia our midst.
The post office and some of the banks aro re
ceiving contributions to the rt/diinley .Memorial
Monument fund. This alT.>rds an opportunity to
every one to give something. The amount need
not be large, but is left to tbe disposition of the
contributor. The important feature is the number
of contributors, as it is intended to be a voluntary
and popular fund. Doubtless, every citizen in
Clarksburg and Harrison county will add his testi
monial to the worth of the illustrious President and
taue great aelight in being a party to the erection
of a monument in Canton, Ohio, his nativetown, in
sacred memory of JfcKinley as one of the noblest
charac'ers, in private and public life, the world
ever knew.

Gentlemen Last summer / caught a cold which seemed to set'
