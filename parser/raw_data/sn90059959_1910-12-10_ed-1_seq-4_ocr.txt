HOME RULE FUND.
The Irish Standard's Home Rule
Fund is now well under way. Several
substantial subscriptions were re
ceived during the past week. The
political struggle now on in the "ojd
land" is being watched with intense
interest. As the balloting proceeds it
becomes more and more evident that
the Liberals, Nationalists and Labor
ites will have fully 70 majority in the
next Houbo of Commons. The iniquit
ous House of Lords seems to be
doomed at last. Help the cause along
by your subscription now.

I am pleased that you initiated the

The President's message was vol
uble, if not valuable.
The new spring styles have been
decided on. Just for variety the hob
ble skirt will be succeeded by a skirt
flaring at the bottom. The peg-top
article never was built for rapid tran
sit purposes.
Out in South Dakota the ballots
used at the recent election were sev
en feet long. If it had been an equal
suffrage state the suffragetts would
have been accused of doing their vot
ing by the yard.
A Wilkesbarre, Pa., minister has
introduced the song and dance meth
od for holding his congregation. This,
however, is not new. Up in Crandon,
Wis., there is a sect known as the
Holy Jumpers who make a specialty
of this kind of thing.
The latest of the new exchanges tc
reach this office is the Winona Cour
ier. The new periodical has all the
freshness, charm and enthusiasm of
a youth who had set out to scale the
heights of success. We do not doubt
that the Courier will make its mark.
With sixty thousand Catholics in the
Winona diocese, for whom the Cour
ier will have a natural interest, a
journal of its scope and quality is
certain to succeed. We wish the new
publication God-speed on its worthy
mission.
ELECTION RESULTS.
The elections in Great Britain 'and
Ireland have progressed far enough so
that the outcome is no longer a ques
tion. The Liberals will win with a
majority which perhaps will not vary
much from that which they had at
the last session. In some districts the
Unionists have gained over the Lib
erals and Laborites, while in others
victory has gone to the latter. On the
whole there has been no alarming
change in any of tho districts. The
reports at the close of Thursday's
polling gave the IriBh Nationalists and
Laborites a lead of fourteen seats over
the Unionists. O'Brien was returned
by his constituency and the latest re
port gave him a total of six seats in
cluding his own. The elections ...re
going very ili'uch as the January elec
tions went. In many cases there is
scarcely a noticeable change in the
majorities of the candidates returned.
From this it is evident that the peo
ple are determined in their resistance
to the House of Lords.
It is expected that as the elections
progress the Liberal majorities will
be more decided than in the districts
so far heard from. The country is
expected to turn to the Liberal and
Labor parties for relief. There is
general satisfaction among the Liber
als with the results oo far made
known. In many of the districts in
London a large number of the voters
were disqualified on account of having
moved since the register was made
up. This condition of affairs was all
for th$ advantage of the Unionists.
In the country districts this advantage
will be removed.
It seems to he a certainty now that
there will he a decided change in the
prerogatives of the House of Lords. A
legislative body that derives its pow
ers solely from the hereditary prin
ciple does not exist in any first class
nation, with the exception of the
present House of Lords in England.
The present demand of the people to
democratize the House of Lords
should be sufficient to move the King
to action.
PRESIDENT TAFT'S MESSAGE.
President Taft's latest message Is
document of about forty thousand
words, covering in detail the whole
range of the nation's needs. The
President has made no new departure
from the policies outlined before the
recent election. He has not touched
upon tariff matters except to strongly
recommend that the tariff board be
made permanent. Of it he says:
"I, am strongly convinced that we
need in this government just such an
office, and that it can be secured by
making the tariff board already ap
pointed a permanent tariff commis
sion, with such duties, powers and
emoluments as it. may seem wise to
congress to give. It has been pro
posed to enlarge the board from three
to five. The present number is con
venient, but I do not know that an
increase of two more members would
be objectionable."
The President is strongly opposed
to
another general revision. He will
not urge further tariff legislation un
til the tariff board has reported its
investigations and then he will ask
congress to consider the tariff/item
by item, basing the future rates on
the data furnished by the investigat
ing board.
He recommends an appropriation of
nineteen million dollars for fertity
•M
ing the Panama canal. He says:
"Amoiig questions arising for pres
ent solution is the decision whether
the canal shall be fortified. I have
already stated to congress that 1
strongly favor fortification and I now
reiterate this opinion and ask your
consideration of the subject in the
light of the report already before you
made by a competent board.
"If, in our discretion, we believe
modern fortifications to be necessary
to the adequate protection and polic
ing of the canal, then it is our duty
canal. It is our property. By con
vention we have indicated our desire
for, and indeed undertaken its uni
versal and equal use. It is also well
known that one of the chief objects
in the construction of the canal has
been to increase the military effect
iveness of our navy.
"Failure to fortify the canal would
leave the attainment of both these
aims in the position of rights and ob
ligations which we should be power
less to enforce and which could never
in. any other way be absolutely safe
guarded against a desperate and ir
responsible enemy."
The President strongly urges econ
omy in administration. The estimates
for the coming year are less than
last year's expenses by fifty million
dollars.
One of the best recommendations
of the President's message is that in
which he reiterates what he said a
year ago regarding the granting of
injunctions. At the present time one
party can get a temporary injunction
against another without the party
against whom the injunction i3 sought
being permitted to appear in court.
This has been a fruitful source of
abuses in the issuing of injunctions.
The President's recommendation for
the passage of a law to properly reg
ulate this matter should be acted
upon.
The message has been criticized by
insurgents as lacking vigor. It is
further criticized for lacking recom-

DEATH OF MRS. EDDY.
With the passing of Mary Baker
Eddy, her work has again come in
for a general discussion after which
there will be a prolonged lull in the
Christian Science world. Like the
founders of other modern church€&,
so-called, Mrs. Eddy was the embodi
ment of the creed she promulgated,
and like other creeds that have no
firmer basis than that which human
hands can devise, Christian Science
will quietly disintegrate and soon be
forgotten. Not many years ago Alex

attention In his own limited sphere.

MONSIGNORE OSTER.
The death of Monsignore Oster in
St. Paul on Monday of this week is
the third death which occurred among
the clergy of that city within a kittle
more than a montli. In this instance,
however, age and infirmities were
factors which were lacking in the
case of Father Dillon and Father Mc
Nulty.
Monsignore Oster was a well known
figure among the clergy of the North
west. He was one of the oldest of
the now living pioneers who did gal
lant service in bettering the interests
of the Church and state in a territory

ARCHBISHOP PROTESTS
Asks Clergy to Request Members of
Their Parishes Not to Patron
ize Salome.
It seems probable that that unde
sirable concoction of lewdness, Sa
lome, is doomed to an early rejection
from the stage. It was proposed to
open the St. Paul opera season with
this obscene production, but a public
protest, however, soon resulted in its
being substituted by a production less
repulsive to the feelings of Christian
people. At the present time a similar
protest is being made against it in
Milwaukee. Archbishop Messmer has
denounced it and requested the priests
Milwaukee to ask the members of
their parish not to patronize it.
"The subject with its surroundings
is absolutely repulsive to Christian
feeling," says the Archbishop in a let
ter to the priests of his diocese.
"Even if the dance of Salome be not
in itself openly immodest and lewd, a
thing I do not know, yet the whole
tendency of the opera, if reports are
true, is a glorification of divorce and
debauchery.
"The character of the story and es
pecially the death of St. John the Bap
tist, is too sacred a theme to be
brought on the stage as it is done in
'Salome.'
"Hence you will please request the
members of your parish to stay away
from this production and thus to ex
press their emphatic protest against
the public production of this opera in
our city."

Democrats are still jubilant over

confident of being able to cap-

will be presidential year.
The chief object of the recent meet

prominence as a vice presidential pos

If Champ Clark is to be the next
speaker of the House (and present

for able and progressive Democrat
aides on the floor to assist him in

work of organization and management
will devolve.

MAYOR OF ROME
Would Tamper With Works of Mi*

A year ago the Fine Arts Depart

joining the capitol's three historic
buildings by stone bridges in order to
make room for entertaining.
It is now feared, says a Rome cor
respondent, that the department will
sanction the mayor's new suggestion
for erecting temporary -wooden
bridges. This would, of course, en
tail breaking into the walls of the
three palaces, and as the bridges must
be strong they will be covered with
metal as a precaution against fire.
They must also be artistic, and
therefore the architectural decora
tions of the palaces will be reproduc
ed in stucco, which it is feared will
be allowed to remain after 1911. The

are to be given then in celebration of
the jubilee of the proclamation of
Rome as the capital of United Italy
furnish the mayor with an excuse for
tampering with the work of Michael

A Lover of His Mother.
Of all the love affairs in the world
none can surpass the true love of a
big boy for his mother. It is a pure
love and noble, honorable in the high
est degree to both, says a writer in
the Intermountain Catholic.
I do not mean merely a dutiful affec
tion, I mean a love which makes a
boy gallant and courteous to his
mother, saying to everybody plainly
that he is fairly in love With her. Next
to the love of a husband, nothing so
crowns a woman's life with honor as
this second love, this devotion of son
to her. And I never yet knew a boy
to "turn out" bad who began by fall
ing in love with a good mother.
Any man onay fall in love with a
fresh faced girl, and the man, who is
gallant with the girl, may cruelly
neglect the worn and weary wife. But
the boy who is a lover to his mother,
in her middle age, is a true knight
who will love his wife as much in the
sear leaved autumn as he did in the
daisy spring time.

When Thomas Carlyle's mother was
nearing the end of her life, he sent
her this letter, which told of the beau
tiful years of their love:
"Dear old mother, weak and sick
and dear to me, what a day this haB
been in my. solitary thought! For,
except a few words to Jane,
not spoken to anyone, nor, Indeed,
hardly seen any one, it being dusk
and dark before I went ont—a dim,
silent Sabbath day, the sky foggy,
dark and damp, and a universal still

day gone 58 years that I was born.
And my poor mother! Well, we are!
all in God's hands. Surely God to

0 my dear mother, let it ever be a
comfort to you, however weak you
are, that you did your part honorably
and well while in strength, and wer«
a -noble mother to me and to us all,
1 am now myself grown old, and hav«
had various things to do and suffer to?
so many years but there is nothing
I ever had to be so much thankful foi
as for the mother had. That is a
truth which I know well, and perhaps
this day again It may be some com

has been any good in the things 1
have uttered in the world's hearing,
it was your voice essentially thatwaa
speaking through me essentially
what you and my brave father meant
and taught me to mean, this was the
purport of all I spoke and wrote. And
if in the few years that may remain
to .me I am to get any more written
for the world, the essence of it, so far
as It is worthy and good, will still
be
yours. May God reward you, dearest
mother, for all you have done for me
I never can. Ah, no! but will think of
it with gratitude and pious love. ere

now and always, and will write n«
