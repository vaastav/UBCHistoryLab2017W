A WORD TO THE WAGE EARNERS I I
Archbishop Ireland in discussing
the dangers of anarchism a subject
on which he touched nt the recent
gathering of the Army of the Ten
nessee at Council Bluffs has given a
further elaboration of his views
The very profuseness of the pros
perity of the United States begets I
peril unless the American people
can be taught to use these favors I
well and wisely Through her recog
nition of manhood in every man the
multitudes become the rulers and I
nt times the multitudes bend too
readily to momentary excitements
Hence the extreme need of the prop
er formation of the popular mind so I
UR to correct thought and righteous I
acting Injury irreparable may be
done during a brief Interval of social
or political Insanity and a frequency
tr such viwlitlons however brief
they may be too easily degenerates
Into abiding habits I extoll the ma
terial prosperity of America But as i
one of its accidental consequences I
must note the spirit of social restless
ness which now agitates the country
and in the appeasement of which the
staunchest forces of patriotism must
be steadily Invoked It is said too
much prosperity comes to some too
JIUle to others henei new mot hods
are called for in the distribution of
wealth and the enjoyment It pro
cures That all is perfect in present
conditions that there is no room for
impress ve mint not ntwcrt tint
nothing should be said or done to
subvert public order destructive of
the spirit of the country and its in
stitutions in the discussions taking
place and the acts following them
the fundamental principles of right
reason and the constitution and laws
of the Republic should not be forgo
ten or seta llde nothing should be
11 authorized or i > ermite l llat fans
difficult the composure
passion I and renders
posure of mind neded in such discus
sions The wild anarchist the wouldbe
assassin are the public enemies of
society whom to tolerate is to tol
rate open sedition An enemy too
1
of p111111c order is the workman who
refusing his own labor deters by
violence u brother workman from
offering his labor as are even in a
greater degree the strong and the
powerful who override the law of
the land in carrying out the schemes
of their ambition Private property
the right of every man to own and
dispose of the fruits of brain and
hand must be regarded as sacred
and inviolable It Is the cornerstone
of the social structure Destroy it
weaken it you arrest ambition and
effort you give room to careless
ness of the morrow to indolence and
idleness you establish barbarism
Barbarism Ms that state of society
where men having nothing which is
the exclusive possession of any prey
upon the strength and labor of the
others Stability of possession and
the stimulus to ambition and effort
resulting from it are vital requisites
for progress and civilization That
in the holding of private property
there be inequality is a fact that in
inevitable Men are not and never
will be equal in the power that builds
up prosperity in the sacrifice of self
and the economy that preserves and
increase it hence they never will be
equal in the amount of property that
they do or can possess
The preaching of Utopias in rem
edy of this inequality the proposal
of schemes that ignore the nature of
m men and the vital conditions of hu
man society are an Insult no less
than an injury to the individual
whom they fain would beguile by
their will othewlsp glamor and de
ception It is the day of Utopias
Seldom if ever before In the history
of human society was there greater
need of prudent wisdom on the part
ofrrudent
of wouldbe teachers of patient re
flection on the part of listening au
I diences The gravest responsibility
rests on all to move slowly to think
wisely to avoid all perils of leaps
Into the dark A chief panacea put
before us is common ownership
through city State and nation of the
chief agencies of productivity and
of the transportation hither and
thither of the results of this pro
ductivity Let all be on their guard
Common ownership in one direction
leads readily to common ownership
in another all the nore so when
the purpose really heLd In mind is
to grasp wealth without much per
sonal effort to make up fqV ones
own deficiencies by despoiling others
And is there not serious danger
1therein of weakening individual am
bition which has been in America
particularly the great stimulus to
the wondrous material development
with which the country has been
blessed
To the poor man to the wage
earner I should indeed preach the
doctrine of ambition and energy Let
every one aim to secure competency
for himself and his iamilj Let every
one strive to rise it is his right it
I is his duty But all this lie must do

NEW ENGLANDS CATHOLIC GAIN I I
The election of Hon James II
Higgins as Governor of Ilhode Island i
and ofn number of Catholics as
Mayors of Providence Pawtucket
Woonsooket and similar centers
seems to have inspired the Catholics I
of Massachusetts into unwonted ac
tivity Or it may be that the splen
did record which Bostons Irish Cath
olic Mayor Hon John F Fitzgerald
is making is encouraging other Mas
sachusetts cities to follow the exam
ple set by the Athens of the United
StatesWhatever
Whatever the rason in any case
it Is certain that a number of Cath
olics In the Bay State suddenly have
found favor at the hands of their
fellow citizens of every creed and no
creed The current Messenger of
Worcester makes this fact strikingly
plain in an article which seems to
prove that the people of New Eng
lund are today looking to the
Catholic Church to lead In the move
ment for political and social reform
In part that paper says
saysThe gives the
strongest evidence that the wave of
reform which has resulted in naming
so many men in the selection of can
didates to head the tickets In various
cities of the State who are Irish
Americans continues unabated
Of course it was always a fore
gone conclusion that Mayor John T
Duggan would be chosen again as
the Democratic candidate for chief
executive of Worcester That Dr
Duggan will win over his opponent
is generally believed
Holyoke has nominated an Irish
American for Mayor and It is signifi
cant to note that in no instance do
the Republican machines make such I
nominations Their policy Is always
to shout for party and if successful
hi elections to get all they can from
the cities
citiesWilliam
William A OBrien was nominated
by the Democrats for Mayor of
Chelsea as the Republican machine
of that city is sunk in the corruption
of graft and some of the city offi
clans arc indicted for crimes Mr
OBrien stands a good chance for
election for people feel that he is
needed to reform the city
cityMayor Medford
has been renominated by the Demo
crats and citizens and he will run on
the Citizens ticket As his name in
dicates he Is another IrishAmeri
can and he represents those who
have risen by the hard toll of hands
as well as brains
Tames F Alywnrd the Democratic
nominee for Mayor of Cambridge is
goodman
man clean wholesome and a stu
dent of affairs He made a bri
Runt record as Alderman In the Uni
versity city Mr Alyward is a law
yer He is also a devout Catholic
and prominent in all Catholic affairs
Mayor James B Casey has been
renominated in Lowell as expected
and he probably will bt reelected
without any great difficulty for his
record is unimpeachable and unac
HI liable He had several I hard con
lets against corruption and loal
monopoly but he always won out
He had the courage tu oust the po

but also so far removed from cor

INCREASFD SALARIES
The salaries of the engineer and
firemen at the City Hall were in

employes are deeply grateful to
Councilmen Bennett to whom is
largely due the credit for the passage i
of the ordinance There is a strong

increasing the pay of the police and

Drastic and Thoroughgoing

POINTS IN MESSAGE TO CONGRESS I I
IPOINTS I
President Roosevelts message
read in Congress on Tuesday is a
State document of more remarkable
strength and force than length and
deals fully and fairly with the great
problems now confronting the Amer
jtcnn people Urging Congress to
safeguard the home by the enact
ment of laws regulating marriage
and diyorcc the President says
I am well aware of how difficult
it is to pass a constitutional amend
uncut Nevertheless in my judgment
the whole question of marriage and
divorce should be relegated to the
authority of the national Congress
At present the wide differences in
the laws of the different States on
this subject result in scandals and
abuses and surely there is nothing
so vitally essential to the wellfare
of the nation nothing around which
the nation should so bend itself to
throw every safeguard as the home
life of the average citizen The
change would be good from every
standpoint In particular it would
be good because it would confer on
the Congress the power at onco to
deal radically and efficiently with
polygamy and this should be done
whether or not marriage and divorce
are dealt with It is neither safe nor
proper to leave the question of poly
pomy to 10 dealt with by the several
States Power to deal with it should
be conferred on the national Govern
ment When home ties are loosened
when men and women cease to re
gard a worthy family life with all
its duties fully performed and all
its responsibilities lived up to as the
life best llvlnir then evil days for the
commonwealth are at hand There
are regions in our land and classes
of our population where the birth
rate has sunk below the death rate
Surely it should need no demonstra
than to show that willful sterility
in from the standpoint of the nation
from the standpoint of the human
race the one sin for which the pen
alty is national death race death
a sin for which there is no atone
ment n sin which is the more dread
ful exactly in proportion ns the men
and women guilty thereof are in
other respects in character and bod
ily and mental powers those whom
for the sake of the State it would
1101 well to see the lathers and moth
ers of many healthy children well
brought up in homes made happy by
their presence No man no woman
Itheir shirk the primary duties of life
whether for love of ease and pleasure I
or for any other cause and retain
his or her selfrespect
The President treats exhaustively
the relations between capital and la
bor with the recommendation thatI I
some measure should be enacted
looking to the curbing of the base
teachings of one and the greed and
avarice of the other and suggests
the following method for settling
disputesIn age of great corporate and
labor combinations neither employ
ers nor employes should be left com
pletely at the mercy of the stronger I
party to a dispute regardless of the
righteousness of their respective
claims The proposed measure would
be in the line of securing recognition
of the fact that In many strikes the
public has itself an interest which
can not wisely be disregarded an
interest not merely of general con
venience for the question of a just
and proper public policy must also
be considered In all legislation of
this kind it is well to advance cau
tiously testing each step by the act
ual results the sep proposed can
surely be taken for the uiclflon of
the commission would not bind the
parties in legal fashion and yet
would give a chance for public opin
ion to crystallize and thus to exert
its full force for the right
President Roosevelt commends the
eight hour work day and in asking
that a drastic and thoroughgoing
child labor law should be enacted has
this to say
The Congress at its last session
wisely provided for a truant court
for the District of Columbia a
marked step in advance on the path
of properly caring for the children
Let me again urge that the Congress
provide for a thorough investigation
of the conditions of child labor and
of the labor of women in the United
States More and more our people
are growing to recognize the fact
that the questions which are not
merely of industrial but of social
importance outweigh all others and
these two questions most emphatic
ally come in the category of those
which effect In the most farreach
ing way the home life of tho nation
The horrors incident to the employ
ment of young children in factories
or at work anywhere are a blot on
our civilization It Is true that each
State must ultimately settle the
question in its own way but a thor
ought official investigation of the
matter with the results published
broadcast would greatly help toward
arousing the public conscience and
securing unity of State action in the
matter There is however one law
tin the subject which should be en
acted immediately because there is
noneed for an investigation in ref
