PITTSBURG. THURSDAY. DEC. 11, 1S90.
A BARGAIN IX REAL ESTATE.
An interesting report comes trom San
Francisco about the purpose of King Kala
kana's visit to this country. That dusky
and poker-playing monarch is reported to
be coming here, not for mere purposes of
festivitv, but with the object of placing a
large block of real estate in this market.
The property which our royal visitor wishes
to dispose of consists of sundry islands in the
Pacific Ocean generally known as the Sand
wich Islands, but more correctly designated
the Hawaiian group. Climate delightful
and sanitary condition excellent barring a
slight tendency on the part of the population
to leprosy and other sporadic ailments.
"Water privileges unlimited. Reasons for
selling, the absolute need of the present pro
prietor for raising a stock of ready cash.
It is understood that other bidders can be
obtained for this property, but as the owner
has expended a large amount of bis cash as
sets in our national game of draw-poker he
thinks no more than reciprocity that the
United States shall return him the moneyon
the purchase of his property. Moreover, the
royal admiration and afiection for the great
nation which gave to the world the game in
which a bob flush may beat two pair it
plaved with the requisite combination of
judgment and boldness creates a decided
pre erence that his property shall pass into
our possess" la, at a really moderate cash
consideration.
Beyond this it is intimated that the
mortgagees of the property, who, perhaps
have a no less tangent ownership than tbe
nominal proprietor, want the United States
to acquire the title in order that their sugar
plantations may get the benefit of the
bounty on sugar production under the new
tariff act All of which combine to produce
among the ruling influence in Hawaiian
circles a firm conviction that the best thing
that can be done is to sell the property to
the United States Government at a price
which will enable KaUkaua to pay all his
debts and fully relieve the monetary string
ency at Hawaii.
It will present a very novel interlude to
the usual methods of surplus smashing
when the King oi the Sandwich Isles brings
out this proposition at "Washington, who
bids on a first-class piece of Pacific Ocean
realty. "Will Congress give the surplus its
coup de grace by that investment?
IT ADOPTS DOTH.
It is a novel indication of the cHss of at
tention that is paid to new movements, to
find the New York Tribune, in commenting
on the platform reported to the Fanners'
Alliance convention, committing itself as
follows: "It will be seen with surprise that
neither of the two great schemes for the
peculiar benefit of farmers has been adopted.
The sub-Treasury scheme has a host of
passionate supporters, but so has the plan of
loans on land, and in the conflict between
tbe two each iails as yet to secure approval."
How, then, does the esteemed Tribune
construe tbe lollowing, which makes up the
greater part of the first resolution of the
Alliance platform, as published in the very
issue of our cotemporary which makes the
above assertion.
We demand that the Government shall es
tablish sub-Treasuries or depositories in the
several States which shall loan money direct to
the people at a low rate of interest not to ex
ceed 2 per cent per annum, on nou.perishable
tarm products and also upon real estate, with
proper limitations upon the quantity of land
and amount of money.
Perhaps if the esteemed Tribune will
study the above extract it will perceive that
it lays a flattering but erroneous unction to
its soul, in supposing that the divergence
between the idea ol Government loans on
farm products and Government loans on
land would prove an obstacle to the Alli
ance. There may have been some difference
or opinion between the two plans; but the
platiorm cuts the Gordian knot in the
promptest possible manner. Instead, ap
proving neither, as the Tribune asserts, it
disposes of tbe subject in a manner much
more agreeable to tbe advocates of the re
spective ideas by adopting them both.
The Alliance, therefore, seems likely to
stand committed to both the sub-Treasury
plan and Government loans on land, in ad
dition to such other little plans as the aboli
tion of national banks, the increase of the
circulating medium to 300,000,000 and
the Government ownership of railways. If
there is anything else that the Alliance
wants, and don't see, it will ask for it.
THE FATLCKE AND POLITICS.
Speaking of the expressions of sympathy
which were elicited from the press gener
ally, ou the first news of the Delamater fail
ure, the Philadelphia Inquirer lugs them
into politics in the following manner:
"Even the Democratic newspapers that
were recently assailing Senator Delamater
in the most vicious and untruthful language
now acknowledge that he was a good fellow
and that they didn't mean anything by it"
Perhaps it would have been wiser, in
view of recent development', if the Inquirer
had initiated the torbearance of the papers
which opposed Senator Delamater in the re
cent campaign. The Dispatch has said,
and still holds, that any talk of actually
illegal transactions in connection with tbe
failure cannot be deemed of weight until
they are backed up by actual evidence.
But the points which are practically con
ceded make it plain that the methods of the
late Republican candidate for Governor are
not such as his recent supporters can take
any pride in.
One feature of the case deserves some at
tention. If the condition of the bank is one
half as bad as the reports make it, the firm
must have been insolvent for some time.
One view states that it has been insolvent
for five years; and it is hardly susceptible of
dispute that it has been insolvent during
tbe period in which the political efforts oi
its members have been prominent. It is
also a lact that large expenditures of money
have been made to further those ambitions.
To use money to the extent reported for po
litical ambitions reveals a perverted idea of
politics; but to employ the last resources of
an insolvent firm, which really belongs to
its creditors, to obtain a political plum re
veals a still more perverted and reckless
idea of business.
THE KEIF KO AD FLAN.
The new road law, as outlined by the re
port of the meeting of tbe Road Commission,
shows a decided advance ou the present state
of the road laws. It it were adopted in the
form outlined it would doubtless produce a
gradual improvement in the condition of the
roads. So far as it goes it is to be com
mended and supported, although it does not
reach some points which are to be regarded
as very important in connection with road
reform.
The purpose of the bill, as outlined, is
very plainly to effect two cardinal purposes.
One is to reform the method in which farm
ers work out their taxes, while still permit
ting them to pay these taxes in labor. The
other is to offer a premium in the shape of
State and county aid to townships which es
tablish solid and permanent roadways. The
amendment in the first respect lies in re
quiring them to furnish their labor at such
dates as the roadmasters may direct, and in
case they do not furnish the labor faithfully
and promptly in authorizing the hiring of
labor and collection of the road tax iu
money. This is something.of an improve
ment, but it fails to develop the full meas
ure of reform possible in the system of work
ing, not by the day, but by the quantity of
work done.
Under the proposed" system of State and
county aid the township road taxes would
amount to one-third of the work done in any
township. More than that proportion of
work will be such as can be done by the
quantity, such as the furnishing of broken
stone, the hauling of gravel or the movement
of earth for grading, all of which could be
done by the cubic yard. If the large amount
of such work that would be done under the
system, is left open to the farmers to do for
cash at a set price per load or cubic yard,
the same object will be effected as if they
were permitted to work out their taxes in
that manner; but it is well worth while to
make some provision for either one or the
other, in the law.
The premium offered for the construction
of good township roads is that for every mile
of solid road built by a township two will be
built in the same township from general
taxation, one by the county and one by the
State. Considering that the largest share of
benefit from good roads comes to their im
mediate locality, this is a rather large
premium. It is not too much to stimulate
the beginning of good work; but after work
was fairly under way in each of the town
ships thoughout the State, it might amount
to a very heavy draft on the State Treasury,
and should be subject to a reduction
ot the proportions in future. The bill ap
pears from the summary to leave the loca
tion of the improved roads to the township
authorities. This is a questionable feature.
Merely local views might produce in a
township a system of roads centering at
some point within the township without re
gard for connection with the highways of
other townships, while the purpose for
which State and county aid should be
granted requires that it shall create a sys
tem of connected county and State high
ways which should be located by no lower
body than the county authorities.
The proposed law very wisely abstains
from any attempt to establish a hard and
fast standard of construction or materials
for improved roads. That course might
lead to the requirement of materials which
would be highly expensive in some local
ities and unnecessary or unsuitable in
others. But in view of the liability of an
easy-going county engineer to approve a
road which might be of such material that
it would go into ruts within a year or two,
and thus cause an expenditure of State
funds for something that is not secured, is
it not possible to establish a practical test
of durability? Thus, if it were enacted
that if by township and county work a sec
tion ot road, not less than three miles, is
constructed, and alter two or three'years of
actual use it passes a State inspection as a
durable highway, would not tbe same ob
ject be attained with a decided safeguard
against the danger of road work which
would be evanescent in its character ?
The proposed plan makes no provision for
the employment of workhouse and convict
labor on road work. This is obviously in
deference to a prejudice that dates from the
days when the management of convict labor
was medieval and inhuman. Superintend
ent Warner's 'practical experiments have
proved that such labor can be economically
employed, and there is no room for doubt
that intelligent regulations can make such
work beneficial to tbe prisoners by affording
them a change of scene, and work for which
they can get a return. Such a plan might
indeed, by proper management, make the
outside work assume the form of a reward
for good behavior.
The renewed evidences that the discon
tent among the Sioux was caused by tbe fact
that they were half starved, calls for a very
searching and sharp investigation of the
officials who are responsible for the failure to
supply them with full rations. The ghost
dances should, if the allegations are true, be
productive of some political ghosts.
The news of suffering among South Da
kota farmers is pretty thoroughly substan
tiated, and appeals for the aid ot the destitute
pioneers of that young State can hardly be
neelected. Some parts of North Dakota are
also destitute, but the commercial bodies of
that State say they can take care of their own
needy people. The boomers of the new States
arc loth to let reports of starving farmers come
East; and they have the right to prevent it by
furnishing the supplies on their own account
But they must not let people starve to death
for the sake of keeping up land sales.
"Cosgbess never had a better chance to
abolish gerrymanders in Congressional dis
tricts than it now has," remarks an organ.
True; and if it will turn out a bill that will
abolish Republican gerrymanders as well as
Democratic ones, it will do a great deal toward
making up for past blunders.
The fact that Pittsburg has jnst had an
experience with overhead electric wires that
produced fatal results is widely noticed. But
an interesting feature in connection with this
is tbe announcement made some time ago that
all tbe overhead wires would be removed from
the down-town part of the city within a year.
As the greater part of tbe year lias elapsed
with no more tangible results than a new and
fatal demonstration, of the need for their
removal, people generally will agree that it is
beginning, to be time that something was
done.
The combination of manufacturers of the
wooden parts of wagons and coaches will ad
vance tbe price ot tbe products ten per cent on
January L Of course this combination was for
the exclusive purpose of "securing to the
public tbe economies produced by actlne in
unison."
The plan of"Senator lngalls to secure the
votes in the Kansas City Legislature necessary
to his election Dv getting the Supreme Court
of that State to declde'in favor of the eighteen
Republicans, claiming additional seats there,
has received a stunning blow in tbe shape of a
decision from tbat court that tbey are not en
titled to their seats. Thus Senator lngalls'
idea of getting bis re-election by aid of the
Supreme Court, turns ont to have been an
iridescent dream.
As the late financial complications permit
the Republican organs to ascribe them to the
elections, and the Democratic organs to charge
them to tbe tariff, one class of the public is
entirely satisfied with the situation.
The death of a child rarely happens that
will cause moro widespread sorrow ana sym
pathy than will be felt by all who hear of the
death of the boy who was the original of "Lit
tie Lord FauntUroy." His characteristics, as
idealized in that charming story and drama
have caused delight to the entire English
speaking world: and Mrs. Burnett will have the
sympathy of countless millions in her loss.
So we are told tbat President Harrison
will not accept a renomination unless the Fed
eral election bill is passed. Probably not for
the same reason that the proverbial boy would
not eat bis supper.
Seceetaev Windom very properly re
fuses to use any portion of the 8100,000,000 re
serve for legal tender notes, to relieve the
money market But since this 30 per cent re
serve is confessedly ample to mako the legal
tenders as good as gold, why not use some part
of the 100 per cent reserve on gold and silver
certificates in tbe purchase of bonds.

The Growing Pride of America.
From the New York Tribunc.1
The new navy is already a source of honest
pride among Americans. In the course of a
few years shipbuilders have been enabled to
rival the best work of European yards. The
crnisers compare favorably in speed with tbe
fastest war vessels afloat and the battle-ships
promise to be among the most formidable and
seaworthy of modern floating batteries. The
nation might have adopted ten years ago the
policy of having its new fleet built and armed
abroad.
A FICKLE DAMSEL,
Sho Elopes "With Another on Her Wedding
Day,'Then Returns to Her Betrothed.
Keypore, N. J., Dec. 10. One month aco
Miss Jennie Barrows was to wed-Mr. Morris
Weinstein, but young Benjamin Robinson in
the meantime won bcr love, and tbey both
mysteriously disappeared on that night and
left the would-be groom awaiting at tbe altar
for the bride. But last night Mr. Welnstein
and Miss Barrows were made man and wife,
although ber forme.- lover stood by and saw
them joined together.
Miss Barrows became acquainted with Morris
Weinstein. They decided to wed on Sunday
evening, November 9. Two weeks before the
wedding day Benjamin Robinson paid marked
attention to Miss Jennie. Niehtlyhe pleaded
with her, and his visits became so frequent
that Weinstein ordered him from the house,
where she was boarding. Robinson met bis
sweetheart in the street andsbe promised to be
true to him.
AH this was unknown to Weinstein, and
when Sunday evening came all arrancements
were made. Tbe groom appeared and was sur
prised in not meeting his bride. They waited
till 9 o'clock, with the same result The next
day it was learned tbat the young lady and Rob.
inson were missing. Weinstein almost went
into hysterics. Isenburg, brother-in-law to the
missing younslady. sought her out and brought
her home. Weinstein was present, and, after
some explanation, tbe j oung couple wee acain
happy. Last night they were made man and
wife in the presence of about 50 people. Rob
inson was present, ana when seen by Weinstein
was ordered from the house, but refused to go.
After a little discussion they quieted down and
Rsblnson made his exit While the bride stood
at tbe altar and tbe clergyman read tbe mar
riage vow she began crying most piteously and
was hardly able to answer tbe questions neces
sary. White Caps Must Go.
Chicago Hcrald.l
That interesting organization known as the
White Caps will have to give up business in
Randolph county, Indiana. Tbey have a law
down there known as the White Cap law, and
tbey have just been applying it to a member of
alocalDandof "avengers." A physician at
Losantvillc, who had received a number of
letters threatening him with death and
adorned with coffins, skulls, crossboncs, knives
and revolvers in the usual White Cap style,
succeeded in ferreting out the author and bad
him indicted by tbe grand jury of the county.
His trial under the White Cap law took place
last week, and resulted in his sentence to the
penitentiary for one year. This is tbe first
conviction under the law, and it shows what
can be done when the victims of threats and
outlawry have the courage to prosecute the
offenders. Tbe tar and feather soirees and
other midnight amusements of tbe White Caps
will probably be less frequent in Randolph
county hereafter.

Santa Claus is coming. He'll soon be here,

Claus. How the 'children love him, to be sure.

their dreams as you and I saw in the long ago.
For Santa Claus, bless his dear old soul, has

and to I then to thine now. Afar off,
way behind tbe big banks of snow
clouds, beyond the shifting streaks of the
Northern lights the little ones in ante-Christmas
dreams see tbe blf; storehouse. What big boxes,
bulging bales, bursting bags, stacks of toys,
heaps of candy, piles of nuts it holds. Tbe
fleet-footed steeds are pawing In the snow for

Borne see only toys, lollypops and sugar plums.

Santa Claus discriminates, of course, but he
shouldn't skip. Hang something on tbe tree
or put something in tbe stocking. Keep np the
innocent play, nourish the beautiful dream. It
will vanish only too soon. When life becomes
a stern reality the tinkle of tbe silvery bells
is muffled in tbe years. But tbe vision and tbe

Republican Policy In Pennsylvania.

Nowspaper Copy and Senator Paddock's
Speech Get Terribly Mixed.
IFBOM A STAir COBEKSPOHDENT.3
Washington. Dec 10. William E. Annin
is the correspondent of the Salt Lake Tribune,
and Is also the private secretary to Senator
Paddock, of Nebraska. A. day or two aco,
while preparing an article for publication, Mr.
Annin was obliged to attend a meeting on the
House side, and left his unfinished manuscript
on bis desk in tbe Senator's room. Upon his
return he was nnable to find bis copy, although
he searched the room over. The Senator was
sought, but ho could give no information as to
how the papers had disappeared, and Mr.Annln
rewrote his article and thought nothing more
of the matter. This morning the Senator
greeted his clerk with the remark: "Howell, I
have found your manuscript, and it appears in
the middle of my speech on the Indian ques
tion, which is printed in tbls morning's Rec
ord." It seems tbat while tbo correspondent was ab
sent an employe of the Record came into the
room in search of the manuscript of tbe Sena
tor's speecb, ancLseelng the copy wbicblthe cor
respondent had written he gathered it up with
tbe speech of tbe Senator and inserted the en
tire matter in the Record. The result is that
tho Senator is credited with what is probably
tbe most eccentric speech on tbe Indian
trouble ever delivered in tbe Senate It reads
in part:

General John H. Rice, the man who has been
creating somewhat of a stir at Ocala, during
the meeting of the Farmers' Allianco conven
tion, is a Georgian. Just before the war he
emigrated to Kansas, and joined tbe Republi
can party, which was then very strong in that
State. He stuck to the party all through tbe
war, and has been a strong Republican ever
since. During the last elections in that State
he ran lor office, and was opposed by his own
son, who beat him pretty badly in tbe race.
General Rice was a leading citizen of Clayton
county previous to his Temoval from tbat sec
tion, and is remembered by many of the older
settlers. His wife is related to prominent
families in that part of the State and in this

BOUGHT A SMALL EMPIRE.
Twenty Thousand Georgia Acres in a Block
for Development
Cordele, Ga.. Dec. la The largest land
trade of the season was mado lately by Mr. J.
F. Horkans, of Sycamore, Ga., a station below
Cordele on the Georgia Southern and Florida
Railroad. He got together a great number of
land owners and offered to purchase 20,000 acres
of land trom them provided tbey would put it
to him cheap enough for him to sell it again
and mako a fine profit on it. He has bought
20,000 acres of this fine timbered land which be
proposes to sell again to a Northern syndicate
at $1 per acre.
This perhaps is tbe largest body of timbered
lands tbat could be bought anywhere, as land
speculators have become so numerous tbat it is
almost impossible to get timbered lands in any
such large ttacts. Mr. Horkans says tbat be
will find purchasers for this land within the
next 60 days, be thinks, and will get the parties
to agree to put in sawmills and rapidly saw
away the timber and open up tbe country for
farming purposes. This land is situated on the
Georgia southern and Florida Railrond. There
aro 127 sawmills on the two roads centering at
Cordele, and Cordele is tbe headquarters for
most of tho great lumber companies of this
section. If a party wishes to buy or sell tim
bered lands in any way he comes to Cordele to
do so.

There was a time when the Knights of Labor
had almost tbe Complete control of all the or
ganizations of workingmen in the country.
Trades unionism never died out, but it was re
garded with a degree of superciliousness by
the greater and stronger organization, tbat
almost savored ot actual contempt Things
have changed since toat time, and the once
despised minority now has an overweening in
fluence in all tbe matters with which both or
ganizations are concerned. Will this Influence
be used wisely and for the best service ot the
community, which means the real good of any
labor organization and of every member of
such an order? The lesson to Mr. Gompers is a
plain one. It is tbat so long as he is conserva
tive, carefnl and just, a peace maker, not a
mischief maker, and a friend of the community
rather than a self-seeker, be will serve the
cause he has chosen and himself, as well. So
soon as he misleads his followers and injures

Shoppers Defended.
'J'HE other day Teresa H. Dean, writing in the
Chicago Herald, cleverly combatted the
prevalent notion among men that they have a
right to chaff their wives, sisters, mothers and
even their sweethearts abont tbeir fondness for
shopping, and their habit of returning from tho
shopping excursion at the time when the street
cars are most crowded, and thus forcing tired
men to give up their seats to the
fair travelers. Miss Dean, in tbe
course of her remarks on this subject,
said: "It is tiresome this sentiment and tirade
about women shopping. Tbe weariest person
on tbe street car at night is the woman who
has spent the day, or 'half of it in shopping.
There are women who make a few purchases
and get more or less pleasure in going from
store to store and feasting their eyes on tbe
beautiful things. But the woman compelled
to join tbe ranks and do tbe shopping for a
whole family does more actually bard work
than four-fifths of tbe men wbo complain tbat
tbe street cars are not reserved for tbeir ex
clusive use at S or 6 o'clock. It is pbyslcal
and mental labor, and is as important in run
ning the affairs of the family as tbe work done
by the husband. At this time of the year
it is literally impossible to do any great
amonnt of sbopptng and get home before
night. Tbe stores are crowded and much
more time is given to waiting than to shopping.
Sensible women are perfectly willing to stand
while tho tired man buries his head in his
newspaper, but it is aggravating to be con
sidered a usurper of the standing room. And
in addition they would enjoy tbe privilege of
deciding for themselves whether it is possible
to get through with shopping before this
sacred hour."
Yesterday a doctor was talking to me of the
number of cases of nervous prostration and
kindred troubles that be had encountered, and
in reply to my query he said that "shopping"
was a form of feminine dissipation that un
doubtedly bad its victims.
A Feminine Dissipation.
kXTes," said the doctor, "I have found tbat
the mania for shopping is a serions mat
ter with some women. In several cases where
I have been called upon to treat a shattered
nervous system, I have discovered no cause for
tbe collapse but a confirmed and violent ap
petite for rushing from store to store, priciog
materials, examining goods, worrying sales
men and still more, saleswomen, and in short
carrying to extremes all that is comprehended
in the word "shopping.' It is actually as
injurious to some delicately organized consti
tutions as drinking, tbe morphine habit or dis
sipation of tbe more violent sorts. It is qnite
true tbat standing before a counter, peram
bulating among a hundred stores, fur hours
together, is a severe strain upon a great many
women who indulge in "shopping' for days at a
time without dreaming they are doing more
barm to themselves than inflicting fatigue for
a time. At this, tbe holiday, season shopping
is at Its height and the number of my fair
patients already show a decided increase."

A Reformed Drunkard's Biography.
Eatonton (Oa.) Messenger. -
Forty years ago, in Walton county, Ga., a
brilliant young man died. A few years previ
ous to bis death be came into a fortune of
$100,000. He took on habits of dissipation; he
became a physical wreck; he scattered bis
fortune to tbe winds; he reformed and lived
long enough to write a history of his life as a
drunkard, and ten days before he died he left
the manuscript with Mr. C. M. Galloway, then
of Walton, now or Putman, with the request
to have it published in book form. Tbat is
what Mr. Galloway is going to do after so long
a time. The book-is called "A Trip to Hell, or
tbe Memoirs of a Reformed Drunkard." We
are told tbat it is exceedingly well written, and
tbat a number of women on Peacbtree street
Atlanta, are going to push its sale II the
profits warrant such action, one half of what Is
made from the book will be given to charity.
OUR MAIL POUCH,
The Italians Are La w-Abiding Cltliens
To tbe idltor of The Dispatch :
Several Pittsburg papers havo been circulat
ing tbe report tbat the Italian miners engaged
by tbe Irwin coal companies are going about
town carrying arms and threatening to shoot
anybody who will interfere with them. Noth
ing more villainously nntrue has ever appeared
in tbe columns of tbe American press. As a
resident of Irwin, and as an Italian myself, I
deem it my duty to vigorously protest against
such slanders, wblch simply aim to discredit a
class of law-abiding citizens. I think it Is time
to call a hale to such a policy, which is thor
oughly in contradiction to tbe tenets of Amer
ican liberty and tbe Constitution. This way of
raging war against a whole nationality by
reason of tbeir willingness to earn an honest
living Is indeed unworthy of the character and
tradition of tbe American people. Will you
kindlv insert in yonr paper this protest of
mine! Should somebody, doubting my asser
tion, desire to enter a discussion regarding the
morals and character of the Italian element, I
will be glad to meet bim.

It is easy to understand why the Northern
illustrated magazines and papers during tbe
war showed the South and her people In an un
favorable pictorial light, but why should they
follow the same line after a quarter of a century
of peace? Even the cleverest magazines and
weeklies in tbe Nortb always have abominable
pictures when they deal with Southern scenes
and people. Tbey always portray dilapidated
houses, rotten fences, untidy surroundings, and
men and women wbo look sloucby, haggard
and uncouth, or else wild-eyed and ferocious.
How long are these pictorial libels to continue?
It is high time for the editors and artists of the
North to recognize the fact tbat our people,
their dress and their bouses are not a century
behind tbe progress of tbe age

Bowth is a colored man who for a longtime

told Doroeher that he could read, and upon be
ing fnrmshed a Bible, he read with perfect
ease. Sam was well-known, and this caused
great excitement about his new gift Bam told
the following story:
"I never had any education, and envied min
isters, and I determined to learn how to read.
I studied, but it was Greek tome. I never
could learn one word, so I took to my knees
and prayed tbat I would be made able to read.
I prayed and prayed every night on my knees,
'asking God tn teach me how to read. Tbe
other night I felt a curious feeling, as if an old
rag was being unwrapped from around mv
head, and something tojd me I conld read, so I
gotaBioleof a neigbnor, and it was all plain.
I can read it plainly and can pronounce all tbe
words right, so everybody tells me. I tell you,
bos, I believe in prayer."
His employor says Sam 13 a truthful darkey,
polite and industrious, and be was never de

that Sam could not read a few days ago, and
