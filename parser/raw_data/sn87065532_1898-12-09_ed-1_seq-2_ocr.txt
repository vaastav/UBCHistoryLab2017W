PRESIDENT McKINLEY'S MESSAGE.
Space will not allow, nor do we
think it uecossary, to copy the mes
sage of President McKinley intact, as
all who take the dailies have already
read it. Taken as a whole, we consid
er it not only a masterful piece of
work, but the whole message, from he-
ginning to end, displays the charac
ter of the man, loyal, trave, honest
and straightforward. His teference
to Cuba is copied below and we hope
our readers will appreciate, as we do,
the fatherly care he proposes for one
of the most degenerate races on the
face of the earth:
"As soon as wc are in possession of
Cuba and have pacified the island.it
will be necessary to give aid and de
cision to its people to form a govern
ment of themselves. It should be un
dertaken at the earliest moment con
sistent with safety and assured suc
cess. It is important that our rela
tions with these peopleshall be of the
most friendly character and our com
mcrcial relations close and reciprocal.
It should be our duty to assist in
every proper way to build up the
waste places of the Island, encourage
the industry of the people and assist
them to form . a government which
shall be free and independentthus
realizing the best aspirations of the
Cuban people. Spanish rule must be
replaced by a Just, benevolent and hu
mane government, created by the pecv
plo of Cuba, capable of performing all
International obligations and which
shall encourage thrift, Industry and
prosperity, and promote peace and
good will among all of the Inhabi
tants whatever may have been their
relations in the past. Neither re
venge or passion should have a place
In the new government. Until there
is a complete tranquility in the is
land and a stable government InaugU'
rated military occupation will be con
tinued," I he President, recognizing the
needs for the public defense, recom
mends an Increase of the regular
army to a force of 100.000 men. and
proposes to enroll in Its organization
ecruits from among the able-bodied
population of the islands that, have
come under national control. The in
crease of the ramy as soon as possible
Is urged, so that tho volunteers now
n the milhary service may be
mustered out. No provision for
the public defense would be com
plete or effective if the navy were
let out of the account. Therefore the
President Approves the recommenda
tions of the Secretary for more war
ships.
The President's reference regarding
yellow foyer is open to criticism from
our part of the country. "Xspurts"
have ruined us, and nothing but na
tional quarantine will ever reconcile
us.
The President makes no recommen
dations as to tho future government
of Porto Rico and the PhiliDDines.
but says that they will remain under
military rule until able to govern
themselves.
November 25 was the 113th anni
versary of the establishment of the
Methodist church In this country.
The first church was dedicated In 13al-

The Nashville Americans sizes It
up in this way: "Spain gets a hand
some Christmas gift. We get a lot
of Islands with a turblent population
and we do not know what to do with
them.

The Smith family may never mono
polize the House of Representative,
hut It Is progressing in that direction.
The present House has four Smiths,
ivnd five havo been elected to the
next House.
The Vicksburg Post, noting the re
turn of Dr. W. G. Klger, president of
the State board of health, from a vis
it to Jackson, says: "Dr. Klger states
tbat the financial affairs of the board
were settled up to date, and though
the fever appeared at a larger number
of places than ever before, requiring
a greater number of physicians, nurses
and guards, that there still remains
an unexpended balance of $10,000 of
the appropriation that will be covered
back into the State treasury."
The new bankruptcy act is now in
effect as regards forced involuntary
bankruptcies, the partial enforcement
of the act of July 1st, having refer
ence only to voluntary petitions. The
sections of the act providing for
forced bankruptcies will apply in
cases where creditors suspect debtors
are guilty of dishonest practices. Bo-
fore such a petition is filed a creditor
must file a bond with the clerk of the
United States district court. The act
further specifies that a petition for
forced bankruptcy can be used only
when the liabilities exceed $1,000.
Senator Hoar is still very emphatic
nbls opposition to the expansion pol
icy of the McKinley administration
and with great clearness he says of
the question of tho annexation of the
Philippines: "My opinion Is that If
tho United States acquires the Philip
pine Island, to govern them as a sub
ject or vassal State, the destruction
of the American renubllo win r)..t
from the administration of William
McKinley."

HORN ISLAND.
Maj. Rossell Reports Favorably
On a Deep Water Project
ttral Seaport
Washington, D. C, Dec. 7, 1893.
The chief of engineers has submitt
ed to Congress a report made by Maj.
Rossell on a survey of a pass from the
Gulf of Mexico into Horn Island har
bor, which was ordered at the last
session of Congress. Major Rossell
states there is a depth of 19 feet at
mean low water over the shoal at the
outer bar, and that the channel
through cannot be permanently im
proved by dredging. He is of the
opinion that any improvement of the
anchorage at Horn Island warranted
by the present available depth across
the outer bay is worthy of being un
dertaken by the government, If. there
is a fair prospect oft J,he saruqbeing
reasonably permanent. He estimates
$50,000 the cost of the required dredg
ing to secure an anchorage at norn
Island 20 feet deep at low water; and,
in view of the improvement being
rensonably permanent, he is of the
opinion the work should be undertak
en by the government. The chief of
engineers concurs. '
CONGRESSMAN McLAIN'g VISIT.
We feel that in the election of Con
gressman Frank A. McLain we have
aided a member to that honorable
body, win, having seen for himself
something of the magnitude of our
lumber Interests, will exert all the In
fluence In bis power to have the mu'ili
neeaea appropriation granted us for
the deepening of our channel.
During his visit he was simnly won-
aer struct at the iminensitv of Mm
umber and capital that had been in
vested by our mill owners. Of course,
we all know that Mr. McLain cannot
accomplish our desires alone, but we
arc satisfied we have the right man in
the right place, and that all his efforts
for us is bound to have an Influence
not be scorned.
Tho trip on the steamer Georgia,
under the auspices of the Pascagoula
Commercial Club, was highly appreci
ated by Mr. McLaluand his enthusi
astic and genial son, veritably a chip
or the old block.
NOT AFRAID OF FEVER IN CUBA.
Major Llddell, of the Fifth Immu-
nes, who Is stationed at Santiago de
Cuba, writes an Interesting letter to
the Grenada Grenadian about the In
difference of Southern sold iersi ii Cuba
to yellow ever. He refers to a visit
to a yellow fever hospital supported
by Miss Helen Gould, and says:
"On returning and being in a re
flective mood, I could not help com
paring the indifference with which
our soldiers regard this disease with
the fright and panic it causes where
ever it makes Its appearance in any
of the Southern States. And I could
not help wondering If It ever occurred
to the panic-stricken people of my own
State what spectacles they of make
themselves by fleeing like frightened
deer from their homes and business
atthe bare mention of a 'suspicious.'
If their scare and running away were
all of It no just criticism could be
t,vm. m n'.itu oro unending
and tlieir little ones, u, .
impoversbing the whole State and be
comes a proper matter of criticism
Tho wild-eyed frenzy is hurting not
only Mississippi but the entire
South."
Congress convened last Monday,
The same Congress six months ago de
clarcd war against Spain, and now
with the war fought and won it comes
together for the legislation of the
questions developed by the eventful
months just passed. The few months
left to the existence of the .Fifty-fifth
Congress gives promise of little more
than a beginning on tho momentous
question and problerri;,gtowing out of
the war. Mr. Morgan, aV, Alabama,
was the first Senator to enter the
enamour and closely following him
came tho octogenarian, Mr. Morill
of Vermont. One by one the members
dropped Into tho chamber and tho
floor soon presented a scene as anima
ted as that afforded by the galleries.
A call of the Senate developed the
presence of sixty seven members. The
usual resolutions were offered and
adopted. In the house Congressman
Wheeler received the ovation of the
day, his colleagues crowding around
and shaking his hand when ho ap
peared upon the floor.
America trouble with tho Spaniards
Is not at an end yet.. McKinley,
Mark Hanna and our better half
were opposed to the war at tho out
set, but Congress would notlistento
McKinley and plunged the country
into war which may cause the country
troublo for many years to come.
