President's Message.
AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION.
. I recommend the adoption of the fol
lowing resolution and urticles amendato
ry to t h e constitution of the United
States :
Resolved, By the senate and house of
reprssemntives of the United States of
America in congress assembled, two
thirds of both houses concurring, that
the following article! he proposed to the
legislatures or conventions of the several
states, as amendments to the constitution
of the United States, all or any of which
articles, when ratified by three fourths of
the said legislatures or conventions, to
be valid as part or parts of the said con
stitution, viz :
Article . Every elate wherein sla
very now exists, which shall abolish the
same therein at any time before the first
day of January in the year of our Lord
one thousand nine hundred, shall receive
compensation from the United States as
follows, to wit : The president of the Uni
ted States shall deliver to every state
bonds of the United States, bearing in
terest, at the rate of for each slave
shown to be therein by the eighth census
of the United States, said bonds to be
delivered to such stale by instalments or
in one parcel at the completion of the
abolishment, accordingly as the same
shall have been gradual or at one time
within such State, and interest shall begin
to run upon any such bond only from the
proper time of its delivery as aforesaid
and afterward. Any stale having re
ceived bonds a? aforesaid and afterward
introducing or tolerating slavery therein
shall refund to tho United Slates ilie
bonds so received or tho value thereof,
aid all interest paid thereon.
Article . Ail slaves w ho shall have
enjoyed actual freedom by the chances of
the war at any time before the end of
the rebellion, shall be forever free, but
all owners of such w ho shall not have
been disloyal, shall be compers-itcd for
them at the same rates as is provided for
states adopting abolishment of slavery,
bet in such a way.that no siave shall be
twice accounted for.
Article . Congress may appropri
ate money and otherwise provide for col
onizing free coloud persons with their
own consent, at any place or places with
out the United Slates.
I beg indulgence to discuss these pro
posed articles at some length. Wilhout
slavery the rebellion could never have
existed, without slavery it could not con
tinue. Among the friends of the Union
there ia great diversi'y of sentiment and
of policy in regard to slavery and the
African race among us. Some would
abolish it suddenly and without compen
sation, some would abolish it gradually
and with compensation, some would re
move the freed people from us and some
would retain them with us, and there are
vet other minor diversities. Because of
these diversities we waste much strength
in struggles among ourselves. By mu
tual concessions we should harmonize
and act together. This would be a com-
promisa among the friends and not with
the enemies of the Union.
The articles are intended to embody a
plan of such mutual concessions. If the
plan should bo adopted it is assumed that
emancipation will follow, at least in sev
eral of the states.
As to the first article tho main points
are :
First, the emancipation ; second, the
length of time consummating, (thirty
seven years) and thirdly, tho compensa
tion. The emancipation will be unsatisfac
tory to the advocates of perpetual slave
ry, but the length of time should greatly
mitigate their dissatisfaction. The time
spares both races from the evils of sud
den derangement, while most of those
whose habitual course of thought will be
disturbed by the measure, will have pass
ed away before its consummation. They
will never see it. Another class will hail
the prospect of emancipation but will de
precate the length of time. They will
feel that it gives too little to the now liv
ing slaves ; but it really gives them much.
It saves them from the vagrant destitu
tion, which must largely attend immedi
ate emancipation in localities wheie their
numbers are very great, and gives the
inspiriting assurance that their posterity
6hall be free forever.
The plan leaves to each state choosing
to act under u to abolish slavery now, or
at the end of the century, or at any inter
mediate limp, or by degrees extending
over the whole or any part of the period,
and it obliges no two states to proceed
alike. It also provides for compensation
and generally the mode of making it.
This, it would seem, mutt further miti
gate the dissatisfaction of those who fa
vor perpetual slavery, and especially of
thoso who are to receive compensation.
Doubtless some of those who are to pay
and not to receive will object j yet, that
the measure is both just and economical
is certain.
The liberation of the slaves is the de
struction of property property acquired
by descent or by purchase, the same as
any other property. It is no less true
for having been often said that the peo
ple of the south are no more responsible
for the original introduction of this prop
erty than are the people of the north, and
when it is remembered how unhesitating
ly we all of us use cotton and share the
profits of dealing in them, it may not be
quite safe to say that the south has been
more responsible than the north for its
continuance.
If, then, for a common object this prop
erty is to be sacrificed, is it not just that
it be done ai a common charge ? and if
with less money, or money more easily
paid, we can preserve the benefits of the
Union by this means than we can by the
war alone, is it not also economical to do
it?
Let us cousider it, then ; let us ascer
tain the sum we have expended in the
war ever since compensated emancipation
was proposed hist March, and consider
w helher,if thr.t measure had been piompt-1
ly accepted by even some of the slave
states, the same sum would not have dune
more to close the war than has been oth
erwise dune. If so, the measure would
save money, and in that view would be a
prudent and economical measure ; cer
tainly it is not so easy to pay something
as it is to pay nolhing. But it is easier
to pay a Luge sum than it :s to pay a
larger one, and it is easier to pay any
sum when we are able than it is to pay
it before we are able. The war requires
them at once. Tin iiggreg-ite sum ne
cessary for compensated emancipation of
eour-f. Would l1 lul'ljur, lui it voul.l pa
quire really no cash nor bondsmen any
fater than emancipation progresses.
This might not and probably would not
close before the end ot the thirty seven
years. At that time we shall probably
lave one hundred millions of people to
share the burd-.n, instead of thirty one
millions as now ; and not only so, but the
increase of our population may be expect
ed to continue for a long time after that
period, as rapidly as before, because our
territory will not have become full. I do
not state this inconsiderately. At the
same ratio ot inert aso which we have
maintained on an average from our first
national census, in 1790. until that of
18C0, we should in 1900 have a popula
tion of 103,208.115, and why may we
not continue that ratio far beyond their
period. Our abundant room, cur biuad
national homstcad is our ample resource.
Were our territories as limited as are the
British Isles, very certainly our popula
tion could not expand as stated. Instead
of receiving the foreign born as now, we
should be compelled to tend part of the
native born away, but such is not our
condition.
We have 2,9G3,000 square miles.
Europe has 3,800,000, with a population
averaging 73 1-3 persons to the square
mile. Why may not our couutry at some
time average as many ? Is it less fertile t
IIus it more waste surface by mountains,
rivers, lakes, deserts, or other causes ?
Is it inferior to- Europe in any natural
advantage ? If, then, we are at some time
to be as populous as Europe, bow soon ?
As to when this may be, we can judge
by the past aud the present ; as to when
it will be, if ever, depends much on whe
ther we maintain the Union.
' Several of our 6tates are above the av
erage European population of seventy
three and a third to the square mile.
Massachusetts has 157, Rhode Island 133,
New York and New Jersey each 80;
also, two other great States Pennsylva
nia and Ohio are not far below, the
forhier having C3 and the latter 59.
The states already above the European
average, except New Yoik,have increa
sed in as rapid ratio since passing that
point as ever before, while no one of
them is equal to some other points of our
country in national capacity for sustain
ing a deuso population.
Taking the nation in the aggregate,
and we find its population and ratio of
increase for the several decennial periods
to be as follows : 1790, 3,929,827; 1800,
5,305,937 3.5502 percent, ratio of in
creases 1310,7,239,8143.645 percent
ratio of increase ; 1 820, 9,638,131
3-313 per cent, ratio ef increase; 1830,
12,800,0203.319 per cent, ratio of in
crease ; 1850, 23,191,8703.587 per
cent, ratio of increase ; 1800, 31,413,
790 3.558 per cent, ratio of increase.
This shows an average decennial increase
of 3.400 per cent, in population through
tho seventy years from our first to our
last census taken. It is seen that the
ratio of increase at no one of these seven
periods is either two per cent, below or
two per cent, above the average, thus
showing how inflexible, and consequently
how reliable tho law of increase in our
(asa !n. Annuming Unit it will continue
it gives ths following results: 1870,
42,323,311 ; 1880,50,907,210; 18110,
70,077,872; 190, 103,208,115 ; 1910,
138,918,526; 1920,180,984,335; 1930,
251,G80,914. These figures show that
our country may be as populous as Eu
rope is at some point between 1920 and
1930 say about 1925 our territory at
73 1-3 persons to the square miles being
at the capacity to contain 217,130,000 ;
and we will reach this, too, if we do not
ourselves relinqui.-h tha chances by the
lolly and evils of disunion, or by long
and exhausting wars springing from the
only great element of discord among us.
While it cannot be foreseen exactly how
much one huge example of secession,
breeding lesser ones indt finitely, would
retard the population, civilization and
prosperity, no one can doubt that the ex
tent of it would be very great and injuii
ous. The proposed emancipation would
shorten the way, perpetuate peace, in
sure this increase of population, and pro-
portionubly the wealth of tho country.
With this we should pay all the emanci
pation cost, together with our other
debts, easier than we should pay our oth
er debts without it. If we had allowed
our old national debts to run at G per
annum, simple interest, from the end of
our revolutionary struggle till to-day,
without paying anything either on prin
cipal or interest, each man of us would
owe less upou that debt now than each
man owed upon it then and this because
our increase of men through the whole
period has been greater than 0 per cent.,
and has run faster than the interest upon
tho debt.
Thus time alone relieves the debtor
nation, so long as its population increases
taster thr.n unpaid interest accumulates
on its debt. This fact would be no ex
cuse for delaying the payment for what
is justly due but it shows the great im
portance of time in this connection the
great advantage of a policy by which we
shall not have to pay until we number a
hundred millions, what by a different
policy we should have to pa)' now when
the number is 31,000,000. In a word,
it shows that a dollar will be much hard
er to pay for the war than will be a dol
lar for emancipation on the proposed
plan, and then the latter will cost no
blood no precious life. It will be a sa
ving of both.

SLAVE.
Tin third nrticlo relates to the future
of these freed people. It does not oblige,
but merely authorizes Congress to aid in
colonizing such as may .oyjsent. This
ought not to be regarded as objectionable
on the one hand or on the other, inas
much as it comes to nothing unless by
mutual consent of the people to be de
ported and the Ametican voters through
their Representatives in Congress. I
cannot make it better known than it al
ready is, that I strongly favor coloniza
tion, and yet I wish to say there is an ob
jection urged against the colored per
sons remaiuing in the country, which is
largely imaginary, if not sometimes ma
licious. It is insisted that their presence
would injure and displace white labor
and white laborers. If there ever could
be a proper time for mere argument,
that time surely is not now. Iu times
like the present, men should utter no
thing for which they would not willingly
be responsible through time and eterni
ty. Is it true, then, that colored people
can displace any more white labor by be
ing free than remaining slaves ? If they
stay in their old places they jostle no
laborers. If they leave their old places
they leave them open to white laborers.
Logically there is neither more nor less
of it.
Emancipation, even without deporta
tion, would probably enhance the wages
of white labor, and verysurely would
not reduce them. Thus the customary
amount of labor would still Lave to be
performed. The freed people would
surely not do more than their old propor
tion of it, and very probably for a time
would do less, leaving an increased part
to white laborer, bringing ,iheur labor
into greater demnndy and, consequently,
enhancing the wages of it. With depor
tation even to a limiud extent enhancing
wages to white labof is mathematically
certain. Labor is Ijke any other com
modity in the market Increase the de
mand for it and you increase the price
for it-. Reduce the stpply of black labor
by colonizing the black laborer out of
the country, and by precisely so much
you increase the demand for the wages of
white labor. But it is decided that the
fiee people will swarrj forth and cover
ihu wlirtle land. Aro rtx-y "oi already In
the land ? Will liberation make them
more numerous? Equally distributed
among the whites of the whole country
and there would be but one colored to
seven whites. Could the one in any way
greatly disturb the seven? There are
many communities now having more than
one free colored person to seven whiles.
and this without any apparent conscious
ness of evil from it. The District of
Columbia and the States of Maryland
and Delaware are a!! ia this condition.
The District has more than one free col
ored to six whites, and yet in its frequent
petitions to congress I believe it has nev
er presented the presence of free colored
persons as one of its gik vances ; but why
should emancipation south send the freed
people north ? People of any color sel
dom run unless there be something to
run from. Heretofore, colored people to
some extent have fled north from bond
age, and now, perhaps, from both bond
age and destitution, but if gradual eman
cipation and deportation be adopted the
will have neither to flee from. Their old
masters will give them wages, at least
until new laborers can be procured and
the freed men in time will gladly give
their labor for the wages till new homes
can be found for them in congenial climes
and with people of their own blood and
race.
This proposition can be trusted on the
material interest involved, and in nny
event cannot the north deciJe for itself
whether to receive them Again? As
practice proves moro than theory, in any
case has there been any irruption of col
ored people northward because of the
abolishment of slavery in the district last
spring ? What I have said of the pro
portion of free colored persons to the
whites in the District is from the census
ot 1800, having no reference to persons
called contrabands, nor to those made
free by the act of congress abolishing
slavery hero.
THE QUICKEST WAV TO OBTAIN peace.
The plan consisting of these articles is
recommended, not but 1 1 tit a restoration
of the national authority fould be accep
ted without its adoption, nor will the
war, nor proceedings under the procla
mation of Sept. 22d, 18G2, be stayed be
cause, of the recommendation of this
plan. Its timely adoption, I doubt not,
would bring restoration, and thereby
stay both, and notwithstanding this plan,
the recommendation that Congress pro
vides by law for compensating nny Stale
which may adopt emancipation before
this plan shall have been acted upon; is
hereby earnestly renewed. Such would
only be an advance part of the plan, and
the same arguments apply to both.
This plan is recommended as a mean
not in exclusion of, but additional to
all others for restoring and preserving
national authority throughout the Union.
The subject ia presented exclusively in
its economical aspect. The plan would
I am confident secure peace more speed
ily than can be done by force alone.
While it would cost less, considering the
amounts and manner of payment, and
and times of payment, and the amounts
would be easier paid than will be the ad
ditional cost of the war if we rely solely
upon force, it is most likely, very lively,
that it would cause no blood at all. The
plan is proposed as permanent, constitu
tional law. It cannot become such wilh
out the concurrence of, first two-thirds
of Congress, and afterwards three-fourths
of the Stales. The requisite three
fourths of States will necessarily include
seven of the slave Stales. Their con
currence, if obtained, will give assurance
of their severally adopting emancipation
at no distant day upon the new constitu
tional terms. This assuranc would end
the struggle now and save the Union
forever.
EMANCIPATION UBCED OX CONGRESS.
I do not forget the graaity which
should characterize a paper addressed to
the Congress of the nation by the chief
magistrate of the nation ; nor d. I forget
that some of you are my seniors ror
that many of you have more experience
than I in the conduct of public affairs. -
Yet I trust that in view of the great re
sponsibility upon me, you will perceive
no want of respect to yourselves in any
uuduo earnestness I may seem to dis
play. Is it doubted, then, that the plan
I propose, if adopted, would shorten the
war, and thus lessen its expenditure o!
money and of blood ? Is it doubled that
it would restore the "national authority
and national prosperity, and perpetuate
both indefinitely? Is it doubted that we
here, Congress and executive, can secure
its adoption ? Will not the good people
respond to a united and earnest appeal
from us ? Can we, can they, by any
other means so certainly or so speedily
assure these vital objects ? We can suc
ceed only by concei t. It is not, can any
of us imagine better, but can we all do
belter ? Object wheresoever is possible,
still the question recurs, can we do bet
ter? The dogmas of the quiet past are
inadequate to the stormy present. The
occasion is piled high v. i;h dilficcilly, and
we must rise with the occasion eow. As
our case is, so we must think anew and
act anew. Wo must disenthrall our
selves, and then we shall save the coun
try. Fellow citizens, we cannot escape his
tory. We of this Congress will bo re
membered in spite of ourselves. No
personal significance or insignificance
can spare one or olher of us. The fiery
trial through which we pass will Ii;;ht us
down in honor or dishonor to the latest
generation. We say that we are for the
Union. The world will not forget that,
while we say this, we do" know how lo
save the Union. The world knows we
know how to save it. We, ev;m we here,
hold the power and bear the responsi
bility. In giving freedom to the slaves,
we assure freedom to the free, honora
ble alike in what we give and what we
preserve. We shall nobly save, or no
bly lose the last b:st hope of the earth.
Olher means may succeed. This could
not fail. The way is plain, peaceful,
generous, just. A way, which if follow
ed, tha a-m-M will ftwip and
God must forever bless.

drove up iu their handsome carriage.

from my side, and went nnd slood nt the
lady's knee, and pointing to her heavy

I niVd not tell you how long I with
stood all their arguments. l!ut nt last
overcome by their entreaties, I consented
to consider the mutter. In two days they
came for my answer. I never mentioned
their vi-it to any of the children, and 1
had changed my mind almost evei-y Loin

know what it meant lo 'go riding,' and

at the horses as they were driven n:. 1

dren supposed that ho was to come back
soon.) and he neve ven looked nt me.
Oh, how jealous my aching heart grtw ?
When I came back into tin) house the
first thing my eye fell on was his cradle.
I could only throw myself on it and sol'
aloud. Then came the trial of telling
the whole Irulh to the children. JN'otu
of them seemed reconciled, nnd I f- h
that the worst was to come when tin
two oldest should return from school. 1
almost dreaded lo meei them, especially
Willie ; be was like bis father, so quiet
and culm outwardly, but hiding beneath j
his apparent coldness the strongest and
deepest feelings. But the others went I.
meet liiern as they came home, and 1
was pleasantly disappointed in the way
the olde.-t took it. He seemed to feel
that I had done it for the best, and linn
be must bide his own sorrow for my
sake. Ilawiis more thoughtful of my
comfort, gentler than ever only very
-till and grave.
' The day ended, as tho longest wjll at
last, and It came lime lo go to bed. I
had taken "iliie to sleep down stairs
near me. Since, his father's death the
other children slept just above us. Wei',
when I came down there was the empty
pillow ! Baby had i.lwnys laid his little
ro-y face ns close to mine as ho could
yet it, and sh pt wiih one little warm
hand on my neck. All . my grie.f broke
out alivsli when I tbouyhLof hira. Willie
raised up at last, an J said earnestly
'Mother, its Charlie you are crying
for, isn't it ?'
'Yes,' I answered, 'I know it's for Ihe
best hut, oh ! it's so hard to give Lini
up.'
'Mother,' continued ihe child, 'when
father died we knew it was for tfie best ;
because God took him from us ; but I
have been thinking ever since we laid
down how poor 1 ttle Charlie must be
cry ing for you, and how God gave him
lo us, to love him and keep him j and
now you have given him away. If ho
had meant him to ba Mr. and Mrs. Lor
i iuier's baby, wouldn't he have given
lii nt to them at fir.-t ?
The child's words carried more weight
with tl em than all tho arguments of my
rich neighbors. After considering mo
ment, I said, impulsively
'Oh, if I only had him back, he
should never g) away again, no matter
how poor wc might he.'
The moon was shining so brightly
thai it whs almost as light us day, and
presently W illie .said
'Mother, it's only half a mile acrosa
the fields, and they won't go to bed for a
long time at Mr. Lorrimers : let us go
and get Charlie, Why, mother, I seem
to hear hira crying now.'
Uiged by the child's entreaties and
the fond promptings of my own heart, I
consented. 1 think I never walked half a
mile so quickly in my life, and neither of
us spoke until we reached the mansion.
Then we stopped a moment for breath,
and sum enough, we could hear baby
screaming nt Ihe top of his voice. Wa
went round to the sitting-room door, and
knocked. They seemed Lalf-frightened
when they saw woo it was, but asked ua
iu politely. A hired nurse was walking
with the child up aud down the floor,
trying to pacify it. Mrs. Lorrimer bad
wenriid herself t, and was lyiug on a
lounge.
'Come to mother,' Willie said, and he
brought the little fellow lo me at once.
How l.c clung lo me, still sobbing, yet
smiling all the while to find himself in
my arms.
'I cannot give him up,' I said nt last,
when I could get my voice clear. 'You
must 1-t me lake him hoiu".'
They evidently thought me the silliest
of worm n, but thtlr cold words only
made me I ha moro determined, and we
started back iu less than half an hour af
ter we came, carrying the baby; Willie
offered to help me, hi t I felt as though I
could carry him in my arms forever.
When 1 had laid him in Ihe bed, now
fast asleep, but still sobbing and reach
ing jut his little hands lo feel if I was
there, I said, 'God help me, come what
will, I wiil never part with one of my
living children, again, a id I never did.
1 nee. I not tell you how wild with joy
the rc;t of the children were when they
found tin; baby in bed next morning.
They almo.-t fought over the little fellow,
and from that day forth it was their
xn nre-t pleasure to amuse Charlie and
have him with them.
When thij ailair camp t be known .
many blamed me, and mtniy favors that
my rich neighbors might have done me
they within Id, I think, for my folly, as
ihey eailed it. But a few poor women
like, myself, that bad always nursed their
own children, raid I did right. Wo had
many tiials, and often scarcely a crust of
bien 1 in the house ; but our hardships
only hound us Ihe rrore closely together.
All Iny children prove I comforts and
blessings lo mi". God took care of one
lor me ; hut as Willie said, we knew that
was br tha best. Th rest married in
the course of time, and left me, hut the
property of my old days, the one wl o 9
industry and management gave me this
plentiful and comfortable home, has neT

officiating priest put lo the lady the ques
tion, "Wilt thou have this man to be thy
wedded husband?" she dropped the pret
tiest courtesy, and with a modesty which
1-nt her beauty no additional grace,
replied, "If you pleas."
