THURSDAY MORNING, DEC. 1611), 1873.
Ex-Gov. Perry's Letter.
We publish on our first page a letter
from Ex-Governor Perry, in wliich he
strongly supports the coalition policy of
the Newe and Courier, and urges the
Conservatives of the State to stand by
and support Got. Chamberlain, in whom
the Ex-Governor seems to place implicit
confidence. This letter; emanating from
so distinguished a source, deserves the
careful and dispassionate consideration
of our readers, and we propose to analyze,
it as far as we may be able to allow the
inconsistency in which the people of
South Carolina must involve themselves
to adopt the line of policy urged in it.
With all due respect for the writer, wo
mnst say that there is not a single reason
urked for the policy advised which would
require an answer, except for the influ?
ence given them* by being over tho signa
ture of Governor Perry, who has usually
been very sagacious in his political views.
This, however, has not been with outex?
ception, for it must be remenibeied that
the Governor has shown himself to pos?
sess the common heritage of humanity,
fallibility; in a most noted and impor?
tant juncture of political affairs in our
State. He was one of: tho oid-tin e lead
ere who urged our people not to vote upon
the'subject of a convention during recon
struct ion, and thereby advised a course
which has done much to bring onr State
to its present deplorable condition of
affairs.. The policy of inaction then re?
sulted greatly to onr. detriment, and will
to-day result in the same if it is persis?
ted i?. There has. not been an election
in Sooth Carolina since reconstruction
in which the policy of either coalition or
Inactivity, or both, has not been tried.
The first election after the adoption of
the present Constitution was conducted
tinder the policy of Governor Perry,
which Wae to stand aloof from politics
and let the fabric of republicanism fall
of its own weight. Governor Scott was
elected; and with Governor Chamberlain
at the- head of the legal department of
tho government, his E.dmiaLjfcratioa' was
marked with griat disaster to the inter?
ests of our State.
Then followed the compromise to se?
cure a portion of the republican vote
which presented Jndge Carpenter as the
opponent of Scott's re-election. In this
election numbers of Democrats would
not vote, and Governor Perry himself,
if onr memory is correct, was by no
means hearty in his support of Carpen?
ter. Scott was re-elected. Next came
the coalition with tho bolting Be publi?
cans, which was bitterly opposed by
many Democrats, and was even strongly
opposed in a negative way by tho Newt
and Courier, which is now so strongly
advocating coalition. The result of this
movement was the election of F. J.
Moees as Governor. Lastly, the Demo?
crats united with the Independent Be
publicans, and ran Green against Cham
berlain. This ticket received all the
Republican vote which can be polled
against a regular nominee, and* all the
Democratic vote that can be induced
to support a compromise ticket, a id yet
it was defeated by about eleven thousand
majority. There were vast numbers of
white people who weald not vote the
ticket at that time, and to-day many who
then voted it would not do so again.
This i? briefly a history of the policy
of coalition and inactivity, and Gov.
Perry urges the people to continue in the
course which has so often brought disas
te? in the past. In his letter, the Ex
GoW says:
"The ottly question at issue now in
South' CarbQrat h reform and an honest
administration of fire government.?
There is nothing else Worthy of entering
into the canvass next fall for State offi?
cers, county officers and'members of the
Legislature. If I thought a Republican,
white or colored, more honest and more
competent than a Democrat, I should
certainly vote for him, notwithstanding
my strong life-long Democratic feelings
and principles."
We are disposed to; differ from him
upon this point, for there is certainly
seven electoral votes for a Democrat or
Republican President to be cast, and
there are the same fundamental princi?
ples of the Democratic party to be sought
for which have always given it support
from the people of onr State. Bat even
if honesty and economy is all for which
we are battling, is it at all likely wo will
secure these results by not organLdng?
There is a full ticket of State officers to
be elected next year, and is it probable
the Republicans will give us an honest
man for Governor, Lieutenant Governor,
Attorney and Comptroller Generals, and
Treasurer? If Gov. Perry has sufficient
confidence in the Republicans to believe
this, his faith is mach stronger than most
persons, and yet he advocates a coarse
which ensures the election of just such
men as they may choose to select His
remarks about his willingness to voto for
colored men show that If his reconstruc?
tion has been slow it has nevertheless
been thorough, but he has happily coripled
it with a contingency which would not
likely arise, and, therefore, he will prob?
ably never be called upon to put his pro?
fessions into practice.
He thinks the Democrats ander obli?
gation to support the Governor becinse,
we suppose, he has done his duty accord?
ing to the writer's views. Well, this
might be a reason for all honest republi?
cans to support him, but we fail to see
any obligation that rests upon the Dem?
ocrats to lay down their principles and
support a man who came into onr State
and raised a negro company to garrison
one of our Counties, and who advosatos
a mixing of the races in our institutions
of learning. There are other requisites
for a Governor besides the mere money
matters of the State, and we are indeed
surprised to see such a man as Gov. Per?
ry advocating a prostitution of the prin?
ciples of our ancestors, whose integrity
and honor have given a glorious birth?
right to every Carolinian, far the purpose
of supporting a man lire Chamberlain,
who, he thinks, has not stolen any pub?
lic money.
He apologizes for his bad appointments
from the fact that better men could not
be selected from the Republican party!
Such an excuse! If there i* any law re?
quiring him to appoint Republicans to
office, we do not know where to find it;
?and if he has appointed bad men to
office, he is not worthy of public confi?
dence, for it is his duty to"-give honest
and competent appointees-, and if he
knowingly does not appoint good men,
or if he continues bad men in ornco, ho
is either a bad man/himself, or aniricom
potent one, and does not deserve the sup?
port of either party,
j SpeaJdngabout nisjcritie3,.weJiaYe
ready shown that there has not been a
test vote since reconstruction, and no
man can say what the Republican major?
ity is if a test were made. We never
have believed, and do* not now behove,
that they have any auefc majority is iis
claimed for them. As to keeping tie
colored party together by opposition we
need have no fears, for - it will assuredly
be as united as it ever was. The 'Union
League has -already been revived,' acid
Governor Chamberlain has indulged the'
pleasure of addressing it.
I The policy of each-county pursuing its
own coarse, independently of othen, 'is
simply ridiculous. It amounts. to fight-'
ing organization with disor^anizaiaon,,
and can at best only result in placing a j
few Conservatives in the Legislature who"
can do nothing to help the County w'lich
sends them nor any other portion of tfc a j
State. . ? ?>. . -jii-j i!c":n ll

to giving them undisputed control of the
State.;:
- The concluding suggestion of calling

tion, for .it would represent neither party,
A better:,' a- fairer and more geneious
coarse is to call & convention of the Dun ?

! For Governor Perry's sake we regret
that he has written the letter ia question,
for it rsndsrs inconsistent, the close of ?
long, active and otherwise consistent po?
litical life.
Local Differences.
We are tired of the war which is goin g
on between different sections of onr State.
Why the discussion of our political pol?
icy -should ba* distorted into a fight for
superiority between the upper and lo ver
counties of the State we cannot under?
stand. There is no hostility whatever
between the masses of the Conservative
voters of the different sections of So ith
Carolina. There may be an honest in ?
ference of opinion as to the best course
to be pursued in the coming campaign,
bat all are united in the desire to sup?
press fraud and corruption, by securing
the rale of honest and competent men.
Because a leading paper in-any partic?
ular section is strong in the advocacy of
a certain course, it is not desirable that
its sentiments shall be styled the policy
of this or that place. Such may or may
not be the fact, bat it is of the uttermost
importance that all. bitterness should be
carefully avoided.in. the discussion of ' he
all-absorbing and all-important subjjci,
of a State policy; and whenever the dis?
cussion is made to take the form of a
contest for superiority between the differ?
ent sections of our State, a degree of ob?
stinate bitterness of feeling and jealotsy
will be engendered; which will render n
effective any line of policy which may be
marked out by the views of tho majority.
We have decided views upon the Una of
policy tor the coming year, and sh ill
from time to time .urge, them upon the
cons id oration of our people, irrespective
of the latitude or attitude in which, they
may chance'to reside; but whether -our
policy prevail or not, we shall be found
battling for the people's interests in what?
ever line of policy they select, when or?
ganized so. as to speak with authority.
The people are the sovereigns of our gov?
ernment, and it is to the policy whkh
may be adopted by the portion of them
who belong to the Democratic party of
oar State that we shall bow in obedience.
No paper, however great its influence nor
however wise its coarse, can be allowed
to dictate to other journals nor to the
people. VThat we need?what we. must
have if wc ever expect or desire to suc?
ceed?is something to PTe us unity of
action throughout the State. This can
be c.on0 by an 0rg'anixation of the Demo?
cratic party?it can be done in no other
way. We should all agree to have an
organization of the party in South Caro?
lina, and be content to let it shape its
own action. Of course, we might give as
much advice as we desire, but the con?
vention would regulate and determine
the line of action to be adopted. If it
should desire to support Governor Cham?
berlain, a resolution from it would have
some influence in harmonizing the con?
flicting views now distracting the Demo?
crat ic party. If it should desire to assort
the independence and integrity of the
Democratic party as a separate party, its
edict to that effect would silence all con?
flict and unite all true Democrats in the
effort to redeem our State. An organiza?
tion is the only thing that will unite oar
people. If there is none, the coalition
with Independent Republican can
amount to nothing, because the people of
some sections will not support them, and
a division of the Conservative vote
amounts to the election of the regular
nominee of the Republican party. That
there should be a convention from the
people is clear to our mind, and will not
be opposed by any who desire to have a
fair and free expression of the sentiments
of the Conservatives or Democratic party.
The endeavor to keep it in a state of dia
. organization amounts to nothing more
than giving the control of the State to
the Republicans, for no man, nor set of
men, have the right to constitute them?
selves the censors of any other set of
men. Neither has any paper, or papers,
the right or ability to control tho views
and actions of other papers.
Hence, as auch serious differences of
opinion exist between the leaders and
papers of the Conservative or Democrat
[ ic party in our State, the only means for
a reconciliation and for harmony, is in
the assembling of a convention repre?
senting the views of the people, who ean
act as umpire.! on oar differences, and
whose award either way would command
respect and-urge obedience. In the dis?
cussion- of this question we should con*
fine ourselves at present to the main
question of an organization; and if we
go into, a discussion of. the objects and
results of organization, it should be with?
out indulging any unkind expressions
towards, others who may differ from us in
our own party. We should endeavor to
act justly towards aH, and aim at discov?
ering the true sentiments of the party
to which We profess to belong. We have
no right to endeavor to continue, to muz?
zle the Democratic party by. allowing it
to remain1 in a state of disorganization,
whereby it is at the mercy of the enemy.
It makes no dofferencd what muy.be the
interests of the particular section in
which wo' may live, our honor and' our
patriotism alike call1 upon us to act in
accord w-ith what may be deemed the.
true, interests of our, Suite, and to take
sueh stops as may be necessary to ascer?
tain frcm tho proper authority What
course is to be pursued.

Gen. Babcock has been indicted by tho
Granu Jury of the.tUited; States .Court,,
now in sesiiion at St. Louis, for complicity
in the whiskey frauds, and 'has 'given;
bail in the sum cf $7.000 to appear for
trial! The Military Court Martial will
sit from day to day without action until
the result of' the trial is known. Thus
another of Grant's pets has become in?
volved in the glaring frauds which are
the land marks of his disgraceful admin?
istration.
Gen.- Babcock, the President's private
Secretary, has been implicated in the
whiskey frauds of which Avery has been
convicted in St. Louis. A military com?
mission of inquiry, consisting of Gens.
Sheridan, Hancock and Terry?two Re?
publicans and one Democrat?has been
appointed to investigate the charges.
The composition of the Court is such that ,
a whitewashing report may be expected.
It is holding its, sessions in Chicago.
The Attorney General tient a dispatch
on the 9th inst. to United! States Attor?
ney Dyer, at St. Louis, saying thai; ad?
vices had reached him to the effect that
Special Counsel Henderson had, in the
course of the Avery trial!, made an at?
tack upon the. President,, and assuring
the Attorney that the department will
not continue to pay-Special Counsel for
this kind of servicB. Such action on the
part of the general government is in keep?
ing with the usual conduct of the President,
who is particular to have none for any
position, wliatever, that hi) controls, ex?
cept such friends as are willing to Mate
his praises on .all. occasions, and when
such an one is found the- President
cares little about his fitness but appoints
him as his trumpeter. This course has .
surrounded Grant with many incom?
petent and corrupt officers,- and-is alike
disgraceful to him and to the party which
endeavors to perpetuate his power.
The centos of 1870 shows that the
nominal wages of the 8,000,000 workers
in .this country roso about 80 per cent,
from 1860 to 1870, while prises rose
about 60 pei* eent With wages averag?
ing $377 yearly in I860, these workers
could buy only au much as $284 would
buy at the prices of 1860, when wages
averaged $289 yearly. The result is that
labor, at the latter as compared with the
former period, suffered a loss of $65 year?
ly. The difference is still considers hie,
though probably not so. groat as in 1870,
for cotton and manufactured goods has
fallen very much in price since thai, timo.
Tbe country needs <md demands .a fixed
currency of sufficient volume x> effect-.-its
exchanges; but hot a wholesale inflation.
Some settled currency as stable value'
should be inaugurated whereby a fixed
and stable value will he given to every
article of commerce, and a proper rela?
tive value established ahd maintained be?
tween labor und products.
The new Constitution of North Caro?
lina prohibits marriages between whites
and blacks teethe third generation; pro?
vides for biennial sessions of the Legisla?
ture, each limited to sixty days; author?
izes the Legislature to farm out the con?
victs ; and invests it also with power to
provide fitting penalties for the carrying
of concealed weapons. There is no doubt
that the feature of biennial sessions of
the Legislature will prove advantageous
to the public interests, for there is as,
much trouble occasioned by too much
legislation as from any other source.
The provision in regard to miscegenation
is a wholesome one,' but will no doubt
meet a storm of indignation from the ad?
vocates of civil rights. Th? proceedings
of the convention were of grea, impor?
tance to the people of the Old North
State, and tbe results show that Demo?
cratic principles have a firm and abi?
ding influence over the affairs of this State.
The colored line is considerably oU ite?
rated in Alabama and Mississippi. The
colored vote is no longer engrossed in
those States by the Republican party.
The colored people understand and exer?
cise the privilege of voting in accordance
with their views of public policy, whether
they agree with those entertained by
themselves previously or by their special
political men tors, or- not. This is tho in?
dependence at which they should aim in
South Carolina,, and it can be reached
only by a determined and vigorous as?
sault upon the infamous corruptions of
tue Republican party in this State. We
should ignore every other question ex?
cept the all-absorbing one-of routing' tho
plunderers from office and placing honest
and capable men in their places. We
should i'i?iat upon the Democratic parly
getting control of the affairs of tho Stater
aa th<i only guarantee of honesty and
economy in it? administration. This ia.
.the plan upon which our sister .Southern
States have succeeded, and whenever we
heartily pursue the same, policy we will
also aiisuredly succeed. The Republi?
cans have been In power now for eight
years and have done nothing towards re?
deeming'their constant and blatant pro
flasions of reform.' It is time'' to try
aiother party, and whenever the tax-'
piyicg people of the State of South Car?
olina unite in a determined opposition to
' the powers that be, the Republican party
iii this. State, which' rests., upon 'frauds
and corruptions innumerable, will van?
ish forever and give place Xo the aame
prosperity which is dawning u?off other
Southern States which have.' thrown off
the Republican yoke.

a passenger by an accident is something
very unusual in this State, but more com?
mon in those sections of our country
where the danger, from carelessness on
the part of train officers. is .more dange

The President's Message.
President Grant's message to Congress
this year was a lengthy paper, containing
about as much demagogism as was possi?
ble to crowd into it. It was, however, in'
many respects an able message, but is
nevertheless, m-irked by very , great .in
decision on some topics,- which shows
that the President fears to commit him?
self to any definite policy with regard to
them.' He is plain enough spoken upon
the subject of 11 union between Church
and :State and sectarian schools?so
much so that lit is now ah'assured fact
if Grant is renominated this will certain*,
ly be one of the planks in the third term
platform: This is a mere subtifuge to
avoid'meeting real issues by presenting5,
to the people imaginary. ones. _ He . re?
commends the taxation.of Church prop?
erty in very positive terms, but really we
fail to perceive'any connection it has
with Congressional legislation. ; If he
were advocating a direct United States
tax, it might be appropriate, but in its
present form wo imagine the State legis?
tures are the proper bodies to act upon
this question, and it was only introduced
to ? make: a little cheap capital for- the.
President in a political point.
. He is utterly silent upon the subject of
a third term, and the whole .tenor of his
'message is, that of a candidate, seeking
popular favor rather than of a 'statesman
endeavoring to lay down the cares of
office with distinction to himself and
good to his country. His silence on this
subject may be regarded as an admission
of his candidacy. No adequate cause is
assigned for the extensive repiirs and
-preparations now progressing in the naval'
department He.speaks of the Cuban
war, its horrors, its seven years of strife,
which make it doubtful if Spain is able
to quell it, but does not favor interference
or recognition, and only promises to send
a further message upon this subject at
another time. He also refers to the ques?
tion of a border war with Mexico on ac?
count of the many depredations upon our
frontier in the same style. The simple
fact is he does not wish to raise any prej?
udice against him on either of these sub?
jects, but prerbni awaiting further devel?
opment!, and will doubtless pursue which?
ever course promises him greatest popu?
larity or power: ^ ' '*'" '
He favors resumption of specie pay?
ment in 1879, the year fixed, if. it is, pos?
sible, but-expresses his doubts as to the
posaibility of preparing the country for
the measure by that time. Upon this
question he is. somewhat practical, aud
offers the following valuable suggestions:
There are a few measures which seem
to me important in this connection and
which I commend to your earnest consid?
eration, aa a repeal of ao much of tie
legal tender act as makes these notes re?
ceivable for debts contracted after a date
to be fixed in the act itself?say no less
titan the first of January, 1877. We
should then have quotations at real val?
ues, not fictitious ones. Gold would no
longer be at a premium, nor currency at a
discount.. A healthy action would set in
all once and with it a desire to make the
currency equal to what it purports to be.
. Second?That the Secretary of the
Treasury be authorized to redeem, aay
not to exceed $2,000,000 monthly, of lo-.
gal tender notes, by issuing in their stead
a long bond bearing interest at the rate
of three and si.ity-fire hundredths per
annum, of denominations ranging from
$60 to $1,000 each.
Third?That additional power be given
to the secretary of the treasury to accu?
mulate gold for final redemption, either
by increasing the revenue, curtailing ex?
penses or both. It ia preferable to do
both, and I recommend that a reduction
of expenditures be made wherever it can
be done withou; impairing government
obligations %r crippling the due execu?
tion thereof. One measure for increasing
the revenue, and. the only one I think of,
18 the restoration of the duty on tea an 1
coffee. These duties would add probably
$1.8,000,000 to the present amount receiv?
ed for imports and would in no way in?
crease the dutieii paid for those articles
by the consumers. These articles are
the products of countries collecting reve?
nue from export!, and as we, the largest
consumers, reduce the duties, proportion?
ally increase them.
He then concludes with this -brief
summary of his message:
First. That the State shall bo required |
to afford the opportunity of a good com?
mon school education to every child
within their limits.
.-' Second. No sectarian tenets shall ever
be taught in any school supported, iu
whole or part, by the State, nation* or
by "the proceeds of any tax levied upon
any community. Make education, com?
pulsory, as far as to deprive alt persons
who cannot read write from becoming
voters after tho year 1890. It is fran
chising nonD, however, on grounds of
illiteracy who may be voters at the time
that this amendment takes effect.: -I
. Third: Declare the Church and I3tate
forever separate. ,and distinct, but. each j
free within their proper sphere*, and that
all church property shall bear ? its own
proportion of taxation.
. Fourth.' Drive out licensed immorality
such as polygamy and the importation of
women for illegitimate purposes. To re?
cur again to the.Centennial year, it Would
seem as though now as we are about to;
begin the'second century of Our national
existence,'would be a most fitting time

of the Senate is a little matter, but it
shows a willingness to. spend the people's
money for their own private gratification/
which is unjustifiable. There is no more
excuse for voting for such a .resolution
than there would be for supporting a bill
to buy each member of the Sen ate a gold
watch, out of the State Treasury. The
Hou?e manifested a better disposition in
declining to adopt a similar resolution.
Congressional Items.
In addition to the previous standing'
committees of the House of Representa?
tives, there will b<) a-committee- of eleven
to be known as the Mississippi Levee
Commission. The duties of this commis?
sion have not ye; been defined,.though
it is supposed it will be ..charged with
general supervision of the great interests
of that section of our country through
which the Mississippi flows.. 'This sec-'
tion of the Union is growing, in national
importance, and its influence over the
affairs of our country is fast increasing.
Gen. Gibson, upon whose motion this
commission was created, will ha chair?
man.
A memorial from the Legislature of
South Carolina was presented. to the
Senate, asking for a repeal of the law
granting United Slates licenses to retail
{spirituous liquorsoutside'of cities and
towns. This petition is about like many
other things done by our Legislature. ? It
will .do no good, and if it should be
I granted will accomplish' noth ng, ' for
I when a man procures a revenue license
; to retail, he has also to comply with the
I local law. Therefore, unless the object
of the Legislature Was to reduce the price
! of licenses in the country, the fiction in
this instance would, if carried out, work
an injury to the people of our Htate in?
stead of a blessing. '
"Retrenchment and Investigation" is.
announced as the watchword of the new
Democratic House?retrenchment in the'
management of all the public depart-!
meats over which the House of Repre?
sentatives has control, and thorough in?
vestigation of the conduct of various
public officers who have been suspected
of, or charged with, corruption or fraud.
This is the key to success for the party,
and if rightly adhered to will bring vic?
tory in the coming presidential canvass;
The memorial of Hon, W. H. Trescotj
praying that Judge H?ge be denied a
?eat from the Third District of this Stafai,
was presented by Hon. 8. S. Cox, of New
York, who said the question involved
was not so much that of a representati ve
as of representation. The memorial wtis
ordered to be printed, and was referred
to the committee on elections. Indica?
tions are that the seat will be declared
vacant.
In the Senate the following nomina?
tions have been presented and confirmed:
j Chandler, Secretary of the Interior;
I Pierrepont, Attorney General; New,

i am glad v?u aro again .agitating the
matter, which has had a Rip Van Winkle
sleep for years. I ? have never had the
slightest doubt that the "Rabun Gap-' ia
tho.most practicable gap through the
mountains, which lie like a wall between
us and the great valloy of the Mississippi.
The work of cutting through the moan
tains at that point is more than half ac?
complished, and I have never doubted
that it would be finally completed. To
stop now and give up the Stump-House
tunnel to the exclusive occupation of
bats and owls for all time to como, would
be discreditable to our character lor con?
stancy, perseverauco and judgment.
I navo been an humble but earnest
advocate of the Blue Ridge Road ever
since the project was started, and I think
it is more necessary now than ever before.
It has been the dream of the State for at
least half a century.

' ?'(The incidental remarks of Judge Wil

hearing of the appeal of tho State from
the order of Judge,Mackey which worked
the release and permitted the escape of]

and determination of at least one of the
Supreme Judges id-prevent the. prpstitu
;.' tion, .to political or. personal ends, of the
; proceedings in"so-called .?odrts of Jus?
tice. Judge Willard said that'he Would
j h?th?v'e permitted Parkers arrest to take
place in the"'presence of the-Con'rt;
neither would'he have permitted him to
go- free, thereby becoming a party to, bis
escape.. Such.proceedings, as that .by
which Parker was {released on a nominal
bail 'ought to be made.' saidJudgo[Wil?
lard,' 'forever impossible.' The proceed
fhgs in the Parker case.' he added,' 'had
no 'parallel within me experience or
knowledge; they- were -of a- nature to
lower, the character of the Judiciary.'
AgaU:, 'Yoluntary. orders on the part
of the Court are necessarily iu the inter?

there is*good ground for hoping and be

Parker -will be brought to account, inas?

discussion of such a policy. They know.

secured by a humiliating coalition with'
any faction of the opposite party;
Upon looking over the field we cannot
see that the coalition policy contains any'
element that can bring the State out of
its present, difficulties. The only hope
is In tho united, energetic and persistent
efforts ?fthe Conservative white people, -
acting as a distinct party in opposition to
Radical corruption and profligacy.
? The leaders of the Democratic party in
this State are of the superannuated order.
They are-content to stand still and grum?

afraid to move in opposition. If one or
