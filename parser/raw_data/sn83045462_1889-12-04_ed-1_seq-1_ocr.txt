A Number of New Bills Introduced,
Including One For a Public Park
in the District.
The Senate.
The credentials of Messrs. Pierce and Casey
as Senators from the new state of North Dakota
were presented, read and placed on file, and
then the two Senators, escorted by Messrs.
I Cullom and Washburn, advanced to the desk
I and took the oath of office,
CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEW SENATORS.
Mr. Hoar,from the committee on privileges and
elections, reported back the resolution offered
by him on Monday providing a mode for ascer
tuining by lot the classes to which the Senators
from the three now states, North Dakota, South
Dakota and Washington, shall be assigned (as
to their respective terms of service).
Mr. Cullom thereupon presented certificates
from the two bouses of the North Dakota legis
lature designating Mr. Pierce as the Senator for
the long term.
THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOTHINO TO DO WITH IT.
Mr. Hoar remarked that that action had been
taken by the two houses of North Dakota after
the election of the two Senators, and he inti
mated that, under the Constitution, the legis
lature had nothing to do with the matter, which
was expressly devolved on the Senate.
Mr. Gorman remarked that identically the
same case had been presented in regard to the
: first Senator from Minnesota, when the legis
lature designated Mr. liice as the Senator for
the long term, and when the Senate decided
that that action could not be regarded by it.
Mr. Edmunds?That is the way it was.
Mr. Cullom explained that he thought it
proper that the action of the two houses of
North Dakota should be placed on the records
of the Senate as an expression of their desire
in the matter.
Mr. Call argued in favor of the right of the
| legislature in the matter.
THE DRAWINO B7 LOT.

I drawing by lot (as provided by it) was pro
j ceeded with. The result of it was that of the
two Senators from the state of Washington

CAPITOL TOPICS.
THE DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVES' CAUCUS.
The democratic members of the House met in
caucus last night and commenced the real
business of the session by electing Mr. Holman
of Indiana chairman of the caucus. The
original intention of the party was to make ex
Speaker Carlisle Mr. 8. 8. Cox's successor in
the chair, but Mr. Carlisle declined tho honor.
The secretaries of the caucus, Messrs. Wilson
of West Virginia and Blanchard of Louisiana,
were re-elected. A resolution was offered by
Mr. Oates of Alabama providing for the ap
pointment of a "steering* committee of fifteen
members, bat nothing came of it. There was
a good deal of debate and substitutes were
offered by two or three Representatives. All
the motions were, however, laid on the table
for awhile. The caucus was notified that the
republican majority would follow out the
custom of allowing the minority to retain one
of their party on the roU of the doorkeeper,
and it was decided to request the retention of
Col ??Dm" Hill, ex-assistant sergeant-at-arms.

Helena, Mojit., Dec. 4.?Both parties we
getting tired of the long dead-lock and there
was general talk lout night of a compromise,
each party (electing one Senator. One combi
nation suggested is W. A. Clark and W. F.
Sander*, another 11. Piatt Carpenter and Martin
Maginnis. The friends of CoL Sanders are
openly urging this ticket since the Hershfield
and Power men united on Carpenter. The ma
jority of the democrats, however, are not
fuvorable to Clark. Many of them are fcr
Maginnis, but if a compromise is arranged they
will be more likely to select Hauser.
The republican senators yesterday morning
notified the democratic senators that they
would like to have a conference, looking to the
breaking of the dead-lock. Yesterday after
noon the democratic senators held a caucus
and decided to adhere to their policy of re
maining away from the senate chamber until
the Silver Bow case is settled. They then
agreed to appoint a committee and meet one
selected by the republicans, the two to jointly
investigate the tunnel precinct case.

What the London Folks Think ot the
Message?Other Foreign Notes.
Loxdox. Dec. 4.?The Timet, commenting on
President Harrison's message, welcomes the
extradition propositi und expresses surprise
that the western states do not revolt against
the heavy exactions of taxation imposed for
the benefit of the cotton and iron workers of
the Atlantic states. President Harrison prob
ably had this in mind when he suggested that
the protective principle should be applied to
farm products.
The Standard thinks that tariff reform may
mean soiuetning real a couple of years hence.
Half the present expenditure is mere extrava
gance that can be dispensed with when the peo

TUE DOCK striker's FUJii*.
The accountant who examined the books on
the money received to aid the dock laborers in
their recent striko certifies that they are in a
fairly satisfactory condition. The deficiency
in the accounts amounts to 41192.
VIEWS ON THE MESSAGE.
What the Press East and West Think
of It.
Chicago, Dec. 4.?The Globe, referring to the
President's message, says: "Curiously enough.
President Harrison follows almost exactly in
the line of Cleveland's last message in declar
ing 'that the collection of moneys not
needed for public uses imposes an unnecessary
burden upon the people.' The similarity ends
with this trank admission and in the Presi
dent's recommendations there is neither reason
nor statesmanship."
The Tintts says: "The message, save as the
President's view has been changed by recent
elections and by department reports, is a re
statement of his letter of acceptance and his
speech on the 1th of March last after taking
the oath of office."
The Newt says: "Perhaps the most striking
feature of President Harrison's first annual
message is the number of new ways for spend
ing money which it points out. The Presi
dent's civil service reform views do him credit
and his recommendations concermug river and
harbor improvements are good."
The Tribune, while finding much to commend
in the l*resident's message, confesses its disap
pointment that the President advocates the re
peal of the internal revenue tax on tobacco.
The Tribune does not believe that the revenue
released by the government would benefit in
any appreciable degree any one but the middle
men in the tobacco trade and urges that the to
bacco tax be continued as a fund to pay pen
sions. "If the dependent pension bill'is put
into operation any revenues that are still found
in excess of the wants of the Treasury relief
can be had by cheapening sugar to consumers
and cutting the bounty of the Havemeyer trust
down by one-half. That. Mr. President, is the
thing to do, but by no means repeal the tax on
tobacco. Let that and the tax on liquors stand."
The Inter-Ocean says: "President Harrison's
message is, first, an exhaustive report of the
state of tho Union in all its domestic and for
eign affairs, and, secondly, s vigorous recom
mendation of certain measures which the re
publican party advocated in its platform and
which the American people approved by the
election of a republican President."
VESSELS lT A GALE.
A Terrible Northeaster Raging on Lake
Ontario.
Rochestkk, N. Y., Dec. 4.?A heavy north
east gale, accompanied by a blinding snow
storm, has prevailed on Lake Ontario for two

beach, six miles west of the harbor. After
much difficulty the life-saving crew succeeded
in reaching a point opposite the vessel, which
was a three-master.
The crew of twelve men were finally rescued

the jury in behalf of innocent men.
The counsel then described how he had been
retained to defend O'Sullivan and said he bad

Wall Street Today.
New Yoke, Dec. A?There was considerable
pressure to sell in the stock market this morn
ing. though the business done was confined to
abont a half dozen stocks, among which Lack
awanna, Beading, St Paul, Missouri Pacific,
New England, Union Pacific and sugar refiner

"It appears, from the foregoing estimates,*
says the Secretary, -that after due provisioa
shall have been made for meeting the ordinary
expenses of the government including the re
quirements of the sinking fund, there will re
main. under the operation of existing laws, six
annual surplus of revenue or about *44.000.000."*
The first thing that occupies the Secretary's
utteution. after making a statcnieut of the re
ceipts and expenditures, actual aud estimated,
showing an annual surplus of *44.000.000, is tha
subject of this accumulation of surplus aud tha
discussion of a means of reducing it.
"An accumulation of money iu the Treasury
beyond the necessities of the" government." he
says, - endaugers legitimate business, tends to
excessive and wasteful public expenditure and
to encourage extravagsuce in private affairs.
In the presence of such conditions it is a mani
fest duty to wisely guard against a future need
less accumulation with its fruitful train at
evils.
MEA.K8 OF BEDCCT10K.
If a portion of the surplus revenue can bs
used to enlarge oar foreign markets, and
thereby advance our commercial and produc
tive interests, it is the part of wisdom to so
apply it The strengthening of our coast de
fences and the building up of our navy sub
jects of nstional concern, offer further oppor
tunity for wise expenditures that would return
the money directly to the people. But after
making provision for such expenditures'as mar
be proper and reasonable for these purposes a
lsj-ge annual surplus will still remain under
the operation of existing laws. Keduction of
the interest-bearing debt of the government
by the purchase ot bonds is the ex,*ditnt re
sorted to for returning a part of this surplus to
the channels of trade, and is the onlv mcaaa
now open to the Secretary of the Treasury fa*
the use of hu money. To require from ' him
this mosaure of responsibility and discretion is
of doubtful wisdom.
A possible successful appeal to this
cretion tempts individuals to rash business un
dertakings, in the belief that the monev im tha
Treasury will be used to avert threatened disas
ter. In the absence of such discretion m tha
Secretary, the possible use of this money weald
cease to enter Into the calculations of the busi
ness world. It is manifestly wrong to take
mouey from the people for the cancellation of
bonds, to the saving of only about 2 psr cent ot
interest when it is worth to them, perhaps,

and internal taxes that an unnecessary i?
