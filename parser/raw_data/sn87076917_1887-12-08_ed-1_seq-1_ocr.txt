and Presidential rrefereucee.
Br the Associated Press.
Ciminnati, Hoc. S. Publication in to
day's Commercial Gazette of Its special
dispatch from Washington about an attempt
to bribe District Attorney Iturnett, was
headed. "The defense make an unsuccess
ful attempt to bribe Sir. Hurnett." When
court convened In the Harper case District
Attorney Huruett made a personal state
ment, sainit that he especially desired it
to be understood that there was no ground,
whatever, for invnlvini; tiie counsel now
representing the defense In any such state
ment or insinuation.
Judge Jackson thought It due to counsel
for defense to say that so far as the court
could judge their conduct had been all that
honorable gentlemen could demand. J nil to
Sage said he w ished to correct a statement
1 1 the publication which ascribed to mm
previous kuowledge of attempted bribery.
lie said he had no information on the sub
ject vv hatcver.
The prosecution made no reference at all
to the publication of the cipher letters be
tween Harper and Miss Holmes.
Mr. Hajes milshed his testimony, and
with It the government rested its case.
The defense called Mr. Kckert for the
purpose of finishing Its cross-examination.
The En;uircr, this morning, prints fac
simile cipher letters, which it says were
furnished bv Charles Hopkins, son of As
sistant Cashier Hopkins. These purport
to be letters seut by Harper to Miss Josie
Holmes, hlj former exchange clerk. It is
explained that after the failure Harper
professed the warmest friendship for his-
assistant cashier. Hopkins, and promised
to do everj thing that could be done to shield
hiui. Young HnpfciiiswascorrespondingI
kind to Harper and became his messenger
to cvry letters to and from Miss Holmes.
While doing this he began to suspect that
Ilarpe r w s arranging to throw upon Hop
kins (his fall 1. r) the responsibility of all
transactions with the grain brokers, and
yjmng Hopkins to place Harper wlthiu his
pjwer, conceived the bold design of con
ceding the letters and delivering verbal
messages only. This worked w ell enough
mill Miss Holmes Isited the jail. Harper
wis furious upon learning of treachery of
his messenger, and has since been cold to
ward Hopkins. The letters were in a cy
pher, which was easily read. Harper also
sent thtee checks to Miss Holmes, which
Hopkins suppressed and turned over to
Djtrict Attorney ltumett. They aggre
gated STOO.OOO. and It is pre
sumed they were intended to be
placed so as to cover up some of the
crooked transactions of his bank.
The letters of Harper to Miss Holmes are
as ardent as those ol ary Jover couId.be. Jn
the first one he instructed her about what
she should say in her testimony. She an
swered, say ing she would be as evasive as
she could, but feared she could not tetify
as be wanted her to, and asked him why he
did not go when he had a chance? She
asked him to send her a lawyer to advise
her how to testify. To this Harper replied
with mad protestations ot love for ills
"bright anger and upbraided her for her
eoiduess, and especially for ffer cold sug-
titn that he should have flown. It looked
to him as though she wanted to get rid of
h'm. He reminded her of his talk during
their last ride together; that he said the
worst thing would bo their separation, and
t lat she said that would never be. and,
p-essiug a kiss on his lips, said she would
go to prison with him, or if that coald nut
be, would visit him daily.
He begged her to get well and come to
hUi before she got Into the safe deposit
box, otherwise all would be spoiled. He
also urged her to take no mom of the drug,
and to decline to be interviewed.
In one of her notes Miss Holmes said to
Harper: 'Your wife has S.500,000. 1
have nothing to do but die, with your
family disgracing me as they have done in
the last two days."
E Ivvard M. Watson, the attorney ent
frmn Washington te assist District Attor
ney Uurnett in the Harper trial, died sud
denly last ev enlng at the residence of Dr.
Kemper, from rupture of a blood vessel.
Harper was seen at the jail this mnrnirg
by a reporter and was asked what he had
to say about the publication of his letters
to Miss Holmes. Harper iiaused a moment
and then Willi clenched teeth said:
"You can say that Charley Hopkins did
not publUh the other letters tnat would
hive benefited me as much as it would his
lather and that he did not publish an) thing
nut the 10 I gave him for her. Now
will you excuse me."
There Is no doubt of the authenticity of
the letters.

speculations which have become so notor-

which refers to the matter this morning.
mus explains me reason, ami its relations
to the administration aresuch Uiat it should
know the.real facts:
'When the umatter. have been removed
the Arlington Park scheme will be rev Wed.
There are between eleven ami twelve hun
dred acres In the old Arlington estate, two
hundred of which are enclosed within the
cemeter) walls, a few acres are used by
the military authorities at Fort Mrr, and
the balance, ome nine hundred acres.
wouiu ne avnuaoie as a public park at very
sngni expense, n.e ground is already
owned by tiie eoveniuient, and
can easily lie reached by the
aqueduct bridge. The proposed
memorial bridge would also make the prop
erty easy of access. At the foot of the ele
vation on which the old Lee mansion and
I'o rt Mjer stand Is a level area comprising
some two hu-dred acres, and this has al
ready been suggested as a magnificent pa
rade ground. It could be lifted for this
purpose at a small sum necessary to secure
thorough drainage. ML Vernon avenue, if
it is ever constructed, would ntu through
this park. Governor l,ee. the representa
tive from the Alexandria district, Is thought
to favor the idea."
There is a flourishing school and church
on the reservation. These also are to be
broken up in the dead of w inter, and the
whole thousand persons, men. women and
children, to be driven off without any pro-
v ision tor mem elsew here, and w ithout pay
ment for what they own and for which they
hold receipts from the government The
ofllcersof the garrison Ime not asked for
the removal. In fact, they want the col
ored settlement to remain. The fort ob
tains its labor of all kinds from the colored
wotknien. As the labor is paid for by the
ground reut due, it Is a great conv enieuce
to the post.
The settlement is apart from an thing
else on the reservation, and Interferes with
notbiug else.

DNkw Youk, Dec. 8.- The Tribune this
morning contains a long interview with
Hon. James G. lilalno on President Cleve
land's message. It was taken lit short
hand under tho direction of the Trlhynr'x
Pans correspondent and sent by caole last
night. The following is an abstract of the
interview:
"I have been reading an abstract of the
president's message and hav e been rspecIaL
ly interested In the comments of tiie Lon
don papers. Those papers all adaumo to
declare the message a free-trade manifes
to, and evidently are anticipating an en
larged market for English fabrics In the
United Mates as a consequence of the pres
ident's recommendations. Perhaps that
fact stamped the character of the message
more clearly than any words of mine can."
"lou don t mean actual free trade with
out dut)?" queried the leporter.
".No," replied Mr. lilaine, "nir do the
Landon papers mean that. Theyaiuiply
mean that the president has recommended
what, in the United States, is known as a
reveuua tariff, rejecting the protective fea
ture as an object and not even permitting
protection to result fieely as an incldeut to
revenue duties." ..
'I don't know that 1 quite comprehend
that last point," said the reporter-!-
"1 mean," said Mr lilaine, "trit for the
first time in the history of ths' United
States the president recoiiimrndsjretalning
the Internal tax in order that the tariff may
lie forced down even below thi fair revenue
staudtrd. He recommends tint the tax on
tobacco 1m: retained and this that many
uiillions annually shall be levied on a do
mestic product which would far batter come
from a tariff on foreign fabrics."'
l nen uo you mean lo imply that you
wou'il favoi the repeal vt l lie tobacco
tax ?'
"Certainly: I meaii just, that."' said Mr.
lilaine. "1 should urge that it be done at
once, even betoro tho Christmas holidays,
it would m the ursi puce brlngi great re
lief to growers of tobacco all over the
country, and would, moreover, m-teriilly
lessen the price of the article to consumers.
Tobacco, to millions ot men. i a necessity.
The pres'dent calls it a luxury, but It is a
luMiry In no other sene than tea and cof
fee are luxuries. It is well to-' remember
that the luxury of yesterday becomes a I.e-
cesslty of today." t
"Well, then, Mr. B'aine. would you ad
vise the repeal of the whisky t4X also?"
"No. I would not. Otlur considerations
than those of financial administration are
to be taken Into account with regard to
whisky. There is a moral site to it. To
ihea pen tho price of whisky is to increase
the consumption euoruously. There would
be no sense In urging the refornl wrought
by higli license in miny states if the l.a
tlnnal government neutralizes the good ef
fect by making whisky within the reach of
every'one at twenty cents a gallon
Whisky has done a vait deal of
barm in the I'u'ted States. 1 would
try to make it do some goed. 1 would use
the tax to fortify our cities on the sealioaid.
Never before in the history f the. world
has any government al'owed creat cities on
the seaboard, like Philadelphia, Now York,
liostoti. Baltimore, Sax Orleans and Sail
Francisco, to remain defenseless."
BuL-said tho reporur. "vou don't
think we aratohave war ... any dlree-
tion?
"Certainly not," said Mr. Blaine.
"Neither, I presume, did Mr. Tiiden when
he wrote bis remarkable letter. But we
should change a remote chance into an ab
solute Impossibility. If our wetk and ex
posed points were strongly fortined; if to
day we had by any chance eveu such a w ar
as we had with Mexico our enemy could
procure lron-ciads in Europe that would
menace our great cities with destruction or
lay them under contribution."
"But would notour fortifying now pos
sibly look as If we expected war? '
"Why should It any more than the forti
fications made sev enty or eighty y ears ago
by our grandfathers, when they guarded
themselves against successful attack from
the armaments of that day. We don't nec
essarily expect a burglar because we lock
our doors at night, but if by any possibility
a burglar comes. It contributes vastly to our
peace of mind and our sound sleep, to feel
that he can't get In."
"But after the fortifications should be
constructed, would you still maintain the
tax on whisky?"
"Yes," said Mr. Blaine, "so long as there
Is whisky to tax I would tax it. and when
the national government should have no
Use for the money, 1 would divide the tax
among the federal union, with the specific
object of lig) tepjug tliu tax on real estate
The houses and farms of the w hole country
pay too large a proiiortijn of the total
taxes."
"Besides your general and sweeping op
positirn to the president's rertinmenda
tion. have you any further specific objec
tion?" "Yes." answered Mr. Blaine, "I should
seriously object to tho repeal of the duty
on wool. 1 repeal tint vvoul I work great
injustice to mauy interests, and would seri
ously discourage what we should earnestly
encourage, namely, tl. sheep rulttirs
among farmers throughout the United
States."
"Do you think if the president's recom
mendation w ere adopted it would increase
our export trade.'"
"Possibly in some few articles of pecu
liar construction it might, but it
would increase our import trade ten
fold as much in the great staple
fabrics, in woolen and cotton good,. In
iron, in steel, m all the thousand aud
one shapes in winch they are wrought.
How are we to export staple fabrics to the
markets of Kurope. unless we make them
cheaper than they do In Europe, and how
are we to manufacture them cheaper than
they do in Europe unless we get cheaper la
bor than they have in Europe?"
"Then you think that the o""stion of la
fa r underlies the whole subject?"
' Of course it does," replitsi Mr. Blilne.
"It is. in fact, the entire question When
ever w can force carpenters, masons, iron
workers and meclianiis in every department
tn work as cheaply aud live as poorly in tho
United States as similar workmen in Eu
rope, we can, of ci urse. manufacture jut
as cheaply as they do in England and
France. But 1 am totally opposed to a pol
icy that would enta'l such results. To at
tempt it is equiv alent to a social and finan
cial revolution, one that would bring untold
distress."
"But those holding the president's
views," remarked the reporter, "are always
quoting the treat prosperity of the couvtry
under the tariff of lslo "
"That tariff did not involve the one de
structive pilnt reinminended by the presi
dent, namely, the retaining of direct in
tenial taxes In ordir to abMUh J idin ct
taxes lev led on foreign fib'ies But the
country had peculiar advantages un'er
it by the Crimean war involving England,
France and It is. Is and laigly luipilriin:
their trade. All thrse I icldeuts, or ael
dent", if yon cl ooe, were immensely stim
ulating to trade in ttie United States, rt
gardless of the nature of our tariff."
"But what about the existing surplus?"
"Iheabstratt of the message I have
sepn." replied Mr. Blaine, "contains no
reference to that point. 1 therefore make
no comment further than to indorse Mr,
Fred Grant's remark that a surplus is al
ways easier to handle than a deficit."
"How will the president's message be
taken in I be south?"
1 don't dare answer that question. The
truth. bs been so long obscured by certain
local questions, unreasoning prudence, that
nobod y can hope fur Industrial enlighten
ment among their leaders just yet. But in
my view the south, above all sections of
Iho Union, needs a protective
tariff. The two Virginias, North
Carolina, Kentucky, .Missouri, Ten-
nssee, Alabama and Georgia have
e lormoiis resources and facilities for devel
oping and handling manufactures. They
cannot do anything without protection.
Kven fie progress o vast as some of these
states unite will he checked If the president'-
mesvage Is enacted into law."
"Wi'l not tho president's rtcommenda
tlon t idmit raw material find strong sup
port"" "Not by wise protectionists in onr time.
Perhaps some greedy manufacturers may
think that with free coal or free Iron-ore.
they can do great things, but If they should
succeed in trying well, as b-iy s say , they
win eaten it on rebound. If any
man can give a reason why we should ar
range the tariff to favor the raw material
of other countries In competition against our
material of the same kind, I should like to
hear II. Should that recommandation of
the president be approved it would turn
100,000 American laborers out of employ
ment.'' "What must be the marked and general
effect of the president's message?"
"It will bring the country where it ought
to be brought to a full and fair contest on
the question of protection. The president
himself makes it the one issue bv nresen t

PROHIBITION STATE CONVENTION.
Sprinslif-lil Will Make Hid for It and

Thursday night the matter of inviting the
prohlbitionins of Ohio to hold their state
convention In this city was discussed at
considerable length and tho question was
Imally leferml to the board of trustees rf
the club with atitl only to do as they
deemed proper about extending the Invita

to extend the invitation and to lay the
claims of Springfield before the state cotu-

The hotel men were sewi and all ex-pre-sed
themselves as willing to make
good rates to Undelegates and to contribute
towards the hind to be raised by the local
1 rohibltionlsts to difray the expenses of
me convention.
Tho natural advantages of SpringBeld
for a state convention are superior to those
of any of the cities which will endeavor to
secure the convention Cincinnati. Cleve
land and Toiedo are after the convention,
but the location of all the-oU against them
Springfield is centrally located, has admira
ble railroad and telegraphic facilities, the
bst of hotels which are amply abl- to care
for the crowds, and a hall which will hold
four thousand piople.
The prohibitionists of Sprinsheld deserve
recognition by the stale committee, not
only on account of their devotion to the
cause of the third party, batalso because of
their numbers and the fact that some ot
the most prominent men In tho third party
movemenl are res'dents ot this city.
Springfield is a republican town, but the
prohibitionists will be treab-d falily and
courteously, as guests of this city always
are. should tl.cy determine to hold their
convention here. We shall make It pleas
ant for them while they are here and then
hjlit then. always fairly and squarely
during the campaign which will follow.
It is sinceiely to tie hopeil that the con
vention will be secured to Springfield.

opera, -ine macK iiussar.'
The scene of the opera of "The Black
IIusar" Is laid In Trantenfeld. a German
v tllage on the Russian border. The time
is lsl.2. when Napoleon is being driven
ack by the Russians. The politic magis
trate strives to preserve the peace and hap
piness of the place by assuming loyalty tn
whatever potr happening to be gresent at
the time. The condition is best told hi the
opening lines ot the chorus:
"Vie who dwell upon the borler.
Kuuw no rvtpite from dliurder "
At the opening scene the Freneli wit.li.
have possession. The viilageis become
aiann eu at ine actions or the magistrate and
demand to know how long their troubles
are to last. Two officers of a German order
which has sworn to drive out the invaders,
appear upon the scene in disguise. Doth

despite the cate the old magistrate has
takn to guard against such a danger,
having them assume shocking de

crisis comes. The villain, u Ke

Russians. Thee are dispersed by the
French, who. in search of the disguised
Hussars, make a mistake and arrest the
magistrate. Before the prisoner Is borne
away the Hussars arrived, the leaders
throw adde their disguises and the act
closes with a grand chorus in which the
troops prepare for battle. The battle is
fought off the stage, however, and the
third act is largely devoted to humorous In
