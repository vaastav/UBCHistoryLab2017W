THE FRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
On another page will be found a
resume of the comments of some of
the leading papers on the President's
message. The message follows close
ly the lines laid down by the republi
can party and is therefore satisfac
tory to republicans and distasteful
to democrats. The subsidized repub
lican papers, whose editors are hold
ing office, cannot praise the message
too highly. The message is a good
one and if Congress will only' pursue
the policy outlined, particularly
on civil service and tariff reform, this
administration will be eminently
successful.

WHVKOVS LEAVE THE FARM.
A great many people wonder whj'
the Vermont farms are deserted by
the sons of the fathers who obtained
competence and happiness from
them. One reason is that many of
the sons are not willing to be as
economical and to work as did their
fathers. Instead of raising corn to
fatten their cattle they prefer to ride
down to the village in a top carriage
after a fancy team and order west
ern corn of the dealer, and get it
charged, too. Instead of husband
ing their resources and endeavoring
to increase their stock of manures,
thev order commercial fertilizers, of
doubtful value, by the ton, and too
often run into debt for them. Hut a
pav dav suri-lv comes. Tntead cf
raising Iusty steers and good honest
toad i- wink horses which will sell
ilr '. lu u four years old, they
delude themselves into the Ixrlief that
their -.!t is tli-ratem-! with speed
and waste twi. . his value in time
an J mnry in t.a.ning him, and then
nine times ou. of ten he proves a
fnilrre ?s a fa-ft .lorse and is spoilt
for anything cImt. And the worst of
t ishisownc i generally sjoilt also.
"The Uarfh" i the name of a new
veekly ncvpajier started in Bur
lington by Itarrett & Johnsons. Nat
uially the publishers claim that
v-ryljodr wants "The Earth."
THE MOVEMENT STARTED.
While Commissioner Valentine has
been pursuing his labors to colonize
the state and sell unoccupied farms
to Swedes, an independent move
ment has started in Northern Ver
mont and a large tract of land has
been sold to a company headed by a
Swede for the immediate coloniza
tion of eight Scandinavian families
now living in Massachusetts. A
Lutheran church is to be established
as soon as a dozen families are lo
cated, and the colon y will come to
stay. The Swede who is managing
the company is himself one of the
owners of this farm property and
proposes to clear a farm on part of
the land already purchased and to
build a home.
Here is actual fruit from the labors
of Commissioner Valentine, assisted
by most of the state press, to build
up Vermont. Foreigners that come
here to plant a church instead of a
saloon are the kind of people this
state wants. They come to buy our
land and then to till it and they will
make good citizens. Commenting
on this movement the Burlington
Free Press well says :
While we look forward with a good
degree of hopefulness to the return
of some of the New Englanders who
have tired of Western life, we believe
that we must face the probabilit'
that this portion of the country must
in time be peopled largely by others
than the descendants of New Eng
landers. In view of this probability,
it has been well said that good judg
ment would seem to indicate that we
choose for the purpose of replacing
the old stock, a race whose tastes
and habits are nearly like ours and
whose characters can be readily
adapted to our institutions.
JEFFERSON DA VIS.
When Mayor Shakespeare of New
Orleans telegraphed Secretary Proc
tor of Jefferson Davis' death the Sec
retary of War replied, "In refraining
from any official action thereon I
would not and hope I do not so add
to the great sorrow of his family and
many friends. It seems to me the
right course and the best one for all.
You will, I am sure, understand that
its adoption is prompted also by a
sincere wish and purpose to act in
the spirit of peace and good will
which should fill the hearts of all
our people."
Secretary Proctor's action in re
fusing to lower the national flag for
an ex-secretary of war is universally
commended in the North. Nor need
it arouse any sectional feeling in the
South. Those who wore the blue
and all others who lived in the North
from '61 to '65 felt that to Davis'
obstinac' and cruelty were due the
prolongation of the war and the
prison-pen atrocities. The country
which he sought to ruin forgave him,
"contenting itself with withholding
from him the full degree of citizenship
which he had forfeited. Jefferson
Davis was the only man in the
United Statas who, having partici
pated in the rebellion, could not se
curea removal of political disabilities
by a two-thirds vote of Congress
under the 14th amendment. Yet it is
possible that even he might have ob
tained full pardon had he shown the
right spirit. But he preferred to
stand apart, sullen, obstinate, bitter
and unreconciled a man without a
country."
NOTE AND COMMENT.
The Pan-American delegates have
finished their observation tour and
settled down to work in Washing
ton. Sixteen committees will pre
sent reports on the topics to be con
sidered after which the real work of
the conference will begin.
The election of Congressman Reed
to the speakership has brought out
the fact that Mrs. Reed is but little
disposed to dip into the mad whirl of
society. In maintaining "Top's"
dignity at 5 o'clock teas and kettle
drums, says the Springfield Republi
can, she will have the sympathy of a
whole nation.
The Portland Advertiser, an ardent
advocate for ballot reform in Maine,
publishes letters from the mayors of
Maine cities, county attorneys and
prominent republicans on the subject
of ballot reform. All execept four fa
vor the adoption of the Australian
system. The Advertiser says edito
rially : "Now that the system has
operated successful in Massachu
setts, there can no longer be any
doubt that the next legislature in
Maine will pass a similar law with
out serious opposition."
"Ear! 'Ear!"
The Hardwick Gazette says that
"the voters of Vermont have their
ears on the ground." Thej- should
pick them up and tack them to the
sides of their heads if they would

The Vermont Trick Again.
J. O. Godfrey of the High St.
market, while dressing a goose for
his own use, found the following
note inside:
"I am a little girl, six y ears old,
and I do hope that the one who gets
this goose will send me a cloak so I
can go to Sabbath school."
Feances M. Newton.
Georgia, Vt.
Mr. Godfrey will comply with the
request and send her the cloak as a
Christmas present. It is to be hoped
that this is not somethinglike the Ver
mont school marm dodge which got
the gold watch out of the mayor of
Boston and a whole outfit of gim
cracks from other sympathetic souls.
Taunton, Mass., Gazette.
A dispatch from Zanzibar an
nounces that Emin Pasha met with
a very serious accident last week.
Being near sighted he walked out of
a window by mistake and fell on his
head, fracturing his skull. He now
lies at Bagamoyo in a critical condi
tion. All the doctors have no hope
except Stanley's physician who is
hopeful of saving Emin's life.
THE TOWNS AROUND.
F.A S T HA RD WICK.
The Farmers' Meeting.
The state board of agriculture held
a two days' session here last Wednes
day and Thursday. C. J. Bell of
Walden was chosen chairman and m
his address of welcome Wednesday
afternoon said, "You are among a
class of farmers, men who get their
living off their farms. We as a class
do not pin as much faith to western
bonds and mortgages as many do.
We also think our Legislature has
given altogether too much scope for
sending our surplus money out of the
state. We should keep more money
at home and invest it here, and those
who do not wish to farm it can find
plenty of undeveloped granite that
is second to none in the eountr-."
William Chapin of Middlesex spoke
on farms and farmers of Vermont.
He said, codfish aristocracy, unequal
taxation, unequal and oppressive
rates of transportation, humbug in
vestments and insurance companies,
and many others that either block
our wheels or are as a drag behind,
all largelv supported bv the farmer.
As to abandoned farms, the 200,000
acres said to be deserted comprise
only four per cent of our farm lands.
Much of this land is high, rocky and
unfit for modern machinery and
ought to be abandoned and left to
grow to timber. Some may be re
claimed, but let us first try to do it
with our own inhabitants. Air.
Hovey thought double taxation was
the cause of hard times while Mr.
Chapin said the law that exempted
$1500 in the savings banks from
taxation helped mostly the rich.
On Thursday Mr. Vail gave a thor
ough discussion of the ensilage ques
tion. W. S. Bailey urged farmers to
breed better horses ; horses from 15V
to 16 hands high. The market is
always good for good horses, many
of our best animals have gone to
South America. What makes a
horse strong is the muscle, not par
ticularly the size. Vermont once had
an enviable reputation for our Mor
gan horses but was foolish enough
to sell the best of them to go out of
the state and help build up the repu
tation of horses of other states and
had to take a back seat, but of late
years she has been gaining ground.
M. W. Davis said, give me the Mor
gan horse. The handsomest horse I
ever saw was a Lambert. Horses
can be improved in size by- breeding
and caring for them. Always feed
them liberally. Breed judiciously
and the Morgan can be made larger.
A 1000 pound is better to drive than
a larger one.

State V.M. C. A. Convention.
The 23d annual State Y. Al. C. A.
convention was held in Burlington
last week. Many interesting and
profitable addresses were given at
every session. Friday morning Sec
retar3r Folsom reported for the St.

bership of 450, active 247, associate
137, sustaining 9, junior dept. 57,

the vice-presidents and E. N. Folsom
secretary.
On Friday night Rev. G. AI. Curl
of St. Johnsbury spoke upon the at
titude of the church to young men.
Among other good things he said it
is the dut3' of the church to point the
direction to the light to every young
man whom it is possible to reach ; to
lead the young man in the right path
after he has once found it. Earnest
ness is worth a great deal in this
work. A cheerful heart and manner
is also of great importance. I have
no patience in sour godliness. It is
impossible to interest a young man
in this work unless we are ourselves
interested. The social clement should
also be made prominent. Courtesy
costs nothing, and it pays to be
down-right social. God pit3' the man
or woman who stands on ceremony
or etiquette in this work. Another
dut3' is the use of tact. Do all 3'our
work for God in a natural, whole
hearted, earnest and common-sense
way.

"DON'T"
Don't say that because yoursalary is small
you cannot afford to insure your life. A lit
tle sacrifice would enable you to pay the pre
miums on a policy, and if your income is
meagre, that is all the more reason why your
dependent ones need the protection a policj
would secure them.
Don't say that because you are in comfort
able circumstances you have no need of life
insurance. When yon shall be too old. or too
much broken in health to insure, your riches
may vanish, and if they do not, the money
from a policy may support your family while
your estate is being settled, may pay urgent
claims and save your property from being
sacrificed.
Endowment Insurance as an investment,
pays as well as a savings bank. I have the
best companies in the world.

provision made for their siiecial needs. His
sanitarium is entirely new, beautifully locat
ed, with the lake and mountains 111 plain

iences and medical appliances. Heating isby
the hot-water system. Ventilation is se
cured bv numerous fire-places. All the pa
