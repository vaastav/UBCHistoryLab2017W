WILSON’S MESSAGE
TO IKE CONGRESS
Senate and House in Joi.it Ses
sion Hear Address of
the President.
HE HAKES FEW SUGGESTIONS
Further Legislation for Settlement and
Regulation of Railway Labor Dis
putes Held Imperatively Neces
sary by the chief Magistrate.
Washington, Dec. B.—The senate
and house met In joint session today
and heard President Wilson's message,
which was as follows:
iSeutlemeu of the Congress :
In fullllnng at this time the duty laid
upon rne by the Constitution of com
municating to you from time to time
information of the state of the Union
and recommending to your considera
tion such legishrtive measures as may
be judged necessary and expedient I
shall continue the practice, which 1
hope has been acceptable to you, of
leaving to the reports of the several
heads of the executive departments the
elaboration of the detailed needs of
the public service and confine myself
to those matters of more general pub
lic policy with which It seems neces
sary and feasible to deal at the pres
ent session of the congress.
I realize the limitations of time un
der which you will necessarily act at
this session and shall make my sug
gestions ns few ns possible; but there
were some things left undone at the
last session which there will now be
time to complete and which it seems
necessary in the interest of the public
to do nt once.
In tiie lirst place. It seems to me Im
peratively necessary that the earliest
possible consideration and action
should tie accorded the remaining
measures of the program of settle
ment and regulation which I had occa
sion to recommend to you at the close
of your Inst session lr view of the pub
lie dangers disclosed by the unaccom
modated difficulties which then existed,
and which still unhappily continue to
exist, between the railroads of the
country and their locomotive engineers,
conductors, and trainmen.
Railway Troubles First.
I then recommended:
First, Immediate provision for tlie
enlargement and administrative reor
ganization of the interstate commerce
commission along the lines embodied
in the bill recently passed by the house
of representatives and now awaiting
action by the senate; In order that the
commission may ne enabled to deal
with (lie many great and various duties
now devolving upon it with a prompt
ness and thoroughness which are, with
Its present constitution and means of
action, practically impossible.
Second, (he establishment of an
eight-hour day as the legal basis alike
of work and of wages in the employ
ment of all railway employees who are
actually engaged in the work of oper
ating trains in interstate transporta
tion.
Third, the authorization of the ap
pointment by the president of a small
body of men to observe the actual re
sults In experience of the adoption of
the eight-hour day in railway trans
portation alike for the men and for
tiie railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the con
gress of the consideration by tiie In
terstate commerce commission of an
Increase of freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures by the rail
roads as may have been rendered nec
essary by the adoption of tiie eight
hour day and which have not been off
set by administrative readjustments
and economies, should the facts dis
closed justify the increase.
Fifth, an amendment of the existing
federal stat'nte which provides for the
mediation, conciliation, and arbitration
of such controversies as the present
by adding to it a provision that, In ease
the methods of accommodation now
provided for should fall, a full public
investigation of (lie merits of every
such dispute shall he instituted and
completed before a strike or lockout
may lawfully he attempted.
And, sixth, the lodgment in (lie
hands of the executive of the power.
In case of military necessity, to take
control of such portions and such roll
ing stock of the railroads of Ihe coun
try as may be required for military
use and to operate them for military
purposes, with authority to draft Into
(he military service of the United
States such train crews and adminis
trative officials as the circumstances
require for their safe and efficient use.
Renews His Recommendations.
The second and third of these rec
ommendations tiie congress immediate
ly acted on: it established the eight
hour day as the legal basis of work
and wages in train service and it au
thorized the appointment of a com
mission to observe and report upon (lie
practical results, deeming these the
measures most immediately needed;
Unusual Experience.
“Man.” remarked Scady, “I did a
thing last niclit what I've no dune this
twenty year. 1 went to ma bed palrr
fectly sober, but I’m rlcbt thankful to
say I got up this tnornln' none the

Somewhere.
Your true lover Is In the world or
you wouldn't be here. You must not
go to any other. That Is the one dead
ly sin. lie is looking, too. As soon as
you both are ready, you will meet. In
her sleep that night she dreamed that
she saw the one who was to come, and
there was a gold light about his head.
•—L. M. Steele In "Doctor Nick."
Its Limitations.
“You can't make a bluff with an
umbrella.” “Why not?" “Because you
must either put up or shut up.”
but It postponed action upon the other
suggestions until an opportunity should
ho offered for a more deliberate con
sideration of them. The fourth rec
ommendation I do not deem it neces
sary to renew. The power of the in
terstate commerce commission to grant
an increase of rates on the ground re
ferred to is Indisputably clear and a
recommendation by the congress with
regard to such a matter might seem to
draw In question the scope of the com
mission's authority or its inclination to
do justice when there is no reason to
doubt either.
Tho other suggestions—the increase
In the interstate commerce commis
sion's membership and in Its facilities
for performing its manifold duties, Hie
provision for full public investigation
and assessment of Industrial disputes,
and the grant to Hie executive of Hie
power to control and operate Hie rail
ways when necessary in time of war
or other like public necessity—l now
very earnestly renew.
Tlu* necessity for such legislation la
manifest and pressing. Those who have
intrusted us with the responsibility
and duty of serving and safeguarding
them In such matters would find it
hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to
act upon these grave matters or any
unnecessary postponement of action
upon them.
Not only does the interstate com
merce commission now find It practi
cally Impossible, with its present mem
bership and organization, to perform
its great functions promptly and thor
oughly, hut it is not unlikely that it
may presently be found advisable to
add to its duties still others equally
heavy and exacting. It must first be
perfected as an administrative Inst ru
men t.
The country cannot and should not
consent to remain any longer exposed
to profound Industrial disturbances for
lack of additional means of arbitra
tion and conciliation which the con
gress can easily and promptly supply.
And all will agree that there must be
no dopht as to the power of the execu
tive to make immediate and uninter
rupted use of the railroads for Hie con
centration of tin* military forces of the
nation wherever they are needed and
whenever they are needed.
Tills Is a program of regulation, pre
vention and administrative efficiency
which argues its own case in the mere
statement of it. With regard to one
of its items, the increase in the effi
clency of (he interstate commerce com
mission. tin* house of representatives
lias already acted; its action needs
only the concurrence of the seriate.
For Control and Operation.
I would hesitate to recommend, and
I dare say the congress would hesitate
to act upon Hie suggestion should 1
make it. Hint any man in any occupa
tion should in* obliged by law to con
tinue in an employment which he de
sired to leave. To pass a law which
forbade or prevented the individual
workman to leave ids work before re
ceiving the approval of society in do
ing so would lie to adopt anew prin
ciple into our Jurisprudence which 1
take it for granted we are not prepared
to introduce. But Hie proposal that
the operation of the railways of the
country shall not he stopped or inter
rupted by the concerted action of or
ganized bodies of men until a public
Investigation shall have been instituted
which shall make the whole question
at issue plain for the judgment of the
opinion of Hie nation is not to propose
any such principle. It is based upon
the very different principle that the con
certed action of powerful bodies of men
shall not be permitted to stop Hie in
dustrial processes of the nation, at any
rate before the nation shall have had
an opportunity to acquaint itself with
the merits of Hie case as between em
ployee and employer, time to form its
opinion upon an impartial statement
of Hie merits, and opportunity to con
sider all practicable means of concilia
tion or arbitration.
I can see nothing In that proposition
hut the justifiable safeguarding by so
ciety of the necessary processes of
its very life. There is nothing arbi
trary or unjust in it unless it be arbi
trarily and unjustly done. It can and
should be done with u full and scrupu
lous regard for the Interests and liber
ties of all concerned as well as for the
permanent Interests of society itself.
Other Legislation Urged.
Three matters of capital importance
await the action of the senate which
have already been acted upon by the
house of representatives: the bill
"'hich seeks to extend greater freedom
of combination to those engaged in pro
moting the foreign commerce of the
country than is now thought by some
to be legal under Ihc terms of Hie laws
against monopoly; the hill amending
the present organic law of Borto Rico;
and the bill proposing a more thor
ough and systematic regulation of the
expenditure of money in elections, com
monly called the Cohrupt Practices Act.
1 need not labor my advice Hint these
measures he enacted Into law. Their
urgency lies In Hie manifest circum
stances which render their adoption at
this time not only opportune but neces
sary. Even delay would seriously
jeopard the Interests of the country
and of the government.

ulnte the expenditure of money In elec
tlons may seem to be less necessary
than the immediate enactment of the
other measure* to which I refer; be

greatly relieve the public mind If this

ent method of obtaining and spending

cent observation and the methods of

tho light of present experience; and a

of those who urged it. Action can be
taken now with facts for guidance and
without suspicion of partisan purpose.
I shall not argue at length the desir
ability of giving a freer hand in the
mutter of combined and concerted ef
fort to those who shall undertake the
essential enterprise of building up our
export trade. That enterprise will
presently, \Vill Immediately assume,
has indeed already assumed, a magni
tude unprecedented in our experience.
We have not the necessary instrumen
talities for Its prosecution; it is
deemed to be doubtful whether they
could he created upon an adequate
scale ymder our present laws. We
should clear away all legal obstacles
and create a basis of undoubted law
for it which will give freedom without*
permitting unregulated license. The
thing must lie done now, because the
opportunity Is here and may escape us
if we hesitate or delay.
Porto Rico’s Needs.
The argument for the proposed
amendments of the organic law of Por
to Kico Is brief and conclusive. The
present laws governing the island and
regulating the rights and privileges of
Its people are not just. We have cre
ated expectations of extended privi
lege which we have not satisfied.
There is uneasiness among the people
of tho island and even a suspicious
doubt with regard to our intentions
concerning them which the adoption of
tlu* pending measure would happily re
move. We do not doubt what we wish
to do in any essential particular. We
ought to do it at once.
There are other matters already ad
vanced to the stage of conference be
tween the two houses of which it Is
not necessary that I should speak.
Some practicable basis of agreement
concerning (hem will no doubt he found
and action taken upon them.
Inasmuch as this is. gentlemen, prob
ably tlie last occasion I shall have to
address the Sixty-fourth congress. 1
hope Hint you will permit me to say
with what genuine pleasure and satis
faction I have co-operated with you In
the many measures of constructive pol
icy with which you have enriched the
legislative annals of the country. It
has been a privilege to labor in such
company. I take the liberty of con
gratulating you upon the completion of
a record of rare serviceableness and
distinction.
Cut Trees by Exploding Dynamite.
Instead of an ax and saw to remove
Hie tops of frees Hint are to be used
ns masts in logging operations, dyna
mite is used to shoot off Hie tops.
After the branches have been removed,
a rigger climbs Hie tree, with a set of
irons, to Hie point where it is neces
sary to cut off Hie top. Here Hie trunk
is usually about 1- Inches In diame
ter. The rigger ties a string of dyna
mite cartridges, fastened end to end
like sausages, around Hu* trunk at tills
point, inserts a blasting cap with about
■jd feet of fuse in one of these sticks,
lights the end of the fuse, and de
scends before the explosion takes
place. The tree top pumps into the
nib with the explosion and Hie trunk
is left ready for attaching the rigging
for dragging in and loading the logs.

WOMEN DOING GREAT WORK j
Club Activities Are Now Widespread
Throughout the Nation, With Most
Beneficial Results.
The federations (National Federa

dren and their parents the American
standards of life, sanitation and do
mestic economics, writes Corra Har
ris in the Saturday Evening Post. The
Nebraska women have a portable
school, which they send to communi
ties in need of it. The Dakota women
have concentrated upon efforts to
Hadden the drudgery of farmers’wives.
Seven thousand women dn Oklahoma
are educating teachers. They sent 38
into the schools of that state last year.
The Arkansas women have organized
11,000 college girls into an active do
mestic educational force, devoted to
service in rural communities. The
Wisconsin clubs specialize main the
health of children, free clinics for ba
bies, and eugenics. Illinois has more
women in its clubs than there are
soldiers in the regular United States
army. Ten thousand of these are giv
ing all their time to social service.
The club women of Louisiana, (leor
gia and Alabama are working for com
pulsory education laws. They have
canning clubs and teachers of domes- )
tic economics and sanitation in rural
communities. Twenty thousand club
women in Texas are working for good
roads. They have built rural club
houses, established markets for farm
women, offered prizes for tin* best
conducted rural schools. Kentucky. I
Georgia, North and South Carolina 1
women are conducting and financing I
"moonlight” schools for illiterates.
Kentucky has 1,000 of these schools, ■
and there is a certain club woman in
this state who has taught 1,800 men
and women how to read and write.
Pretended Dcafmutism.
A French medical Journal, Le Cn
ducee, reports n strange case, the sim
ulation of deufmutism hy n young sol
dier. following the explosion of a great
shell. The case Is given by M. Ber
rnyer. In consultation the man
seemed to he an absolute denfmute.
Before the explosion his speech and
hearing were normal. He had at once
been told that ho would recover, in
formation that did not appear to af
ford him any special pleasure. Close
watching did not disclose any evidence
of simulation. He was them placed in
a state of semi-eonseiousness with
chloroform, and in lids condition
conversed without difficulty. A dress
ing vas applied to his throat for the
psychic effect. Afterward he admit
ted recovery, hut exhibited no delight
over his good fortune. It was sup
posed that the original shock was gen
uine and that after this came the
thought of deliberate malingering in
order to keep out of the fighting line.
He had played tin l part of a mute for
six weeks.
Spooning Wastes Time.
“Spooning Is a waste of time," Dr.
Joel 11. Hildebrand, chemistry profes
sor at the University of California,
told Ids freshman class, Then he
added:
“Physical attraction should he sec
ondary. Men and women should meet
on the common ground of intelligence
ami fellowship. Their interests should
be genuine. To commence a friendship
with spooning puts the relation on a
false foundation. Both are concealing
their better selves, their real Interests
behind the mask of conventional silli
ness.
“It Is the beauty <>f lli<' soul ami

rests. A wife does not need to be a
Venus."
Dangerous War Souvenirs.
(lun shells are not proving a suc
cess as souvenirs If we are to gauge
the new custom by the number of ac
cidents reported In the newspapers.
The last affair of this kind seems to
have occurred in London, Kurland,
near Paddington. at the home of an
army captain away on foreign serv
ice. who, as a polite attention to his
wife, sent hern shell with a time fuse*,
obtained as a trophy from a field of
battle. On receiving It the lady gave
It a prominent place in the drawing
room, but not knowing Its dangerous
character omitted to warn the servant
girl. The latter, by some clumsy ma
neuver with the broom, managed to
knock It over, and it exploded, frac
turing her right leg and elbow and
demolishing part of the house.
Use of Artificial Gas.
That the use of artificial gas as a
domestic and industrial fuel is In
creasing and that Its utill/.atlon for
Illuminating purposes Is decreasing Is
indicated by a report recently Issued
by the department of the interior,
which covers the use of the product
in utlfi.
It is pointed out that -(!<!,-(M.L’IS.OOO
cubic feet of gas was sold during Milo,
and that the value of this production
amounted to $1 7 ’. s.TJ.l.'t", according to
statistics collected by ('. K. Lesher of
the United Slates geological survey,
and TJS.IOII.IUtI.tt I M * cubic feet of coal
gas was consumed during tin* same
period, valued at $48,55",007.
The statistics show that !10 per cent
of the gas was used for illuminating,
■IS per cent for domestic fuel and 22
per cent for Industrial fuel.
Aluminum on Skis Lengthens Jump.
An increase of several yards in the
jump of ski-runners is a rather sur
prising result of the process of metal
lizing objects by means of n spray. In
Switzerland n coating of aluminum of
the thickness of thin cardboard Is be
ing applied to the ski blades by this
method, and this not only adds greatly
to the durability of the hearing surface
but it also very materially lessens fric
tion and tends further to prevent cak
ing of snow on the blades. It Is the di
minished friction that lengthens the
Jump
