CONSTITUTION IS AGREED

UPON BY DELEGATES
Last Attempt is Made to Exempt
the Judiciary From the Re
call, and Fails by Large
Majority Convention
May Not Adjourn
Till Saturday
HHOKN1X, Dec. B. When the con.
stitutional convention adjourned late
today over tall the constitution had
been finally adopted, the session
being divided between committee or
tha wbol cnnRldprallnn n' .o pr'st
ed document, section by sec'ion.
and the last readinK lor final cdop
tion. The last attempt was niirie by con
servative members to secure exerap
tion from recal lot Judges, but like
nil previous attacks on the recall
measure, it failed by an ovcrnL
lug vote.
Tothlll, democrat, of Greenlee coun
t, led the attack on the recall ot
Ihe Judiciary today, moving to ex-1
cept them from Its operation, pre
facing his mo'lon by quntins Taft's
message to congress today regard
ing the Judiciary. He stated his be
lief that Taft would not approve
the constitution that included re
call of the Judiciary. There was
little debate, the motion railing by
a vote of 14 to 32, six democrats
and -eWt-nepublIcans'"Yotinsin "the
altirmative.
The legislative, Jud'cial and execu
tive department articles obtained fin
al adoption at the afternoon session.
The preamble, four articles, lnclud
Ing boundar ea, the Initiative and re
ferendum, distribution of powers, and
declaration of rights were adopted in
the forenoon session. The only im
portani ccange in me jua cai arucie
was the raising of the salary or tne
superior Judge of Greenlee cpunty
from $3,000 to $3,500.
It le beginning to look now as
though there would be delay in ad
Journment becauoe of lnabil ty to ob
tain articles from the printer, and
leading democrats predicted tonight
that probably they would not adjourn
until Friday or Saturday.
The follow ng Is the proposed con
stitution as agreed upon up to
present time, and which will doubt
leso be adopted without and material
change:
We, the people of the State ot
Arizona, grateful to Almighty God
for our uuertles, do ordain this

AGAINST INCLUDING THE RECALL OR
THE INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM
1
(S.pecialto The Review,)
PHOENIX, Ariz., Dec. 6. It can be stated with authority that a telegram was received
by one of the members of the constitutional convention from Senator Joe Bailey of Texas
advising against putting the lecall and initiative and referendum in Arizona's constitution.
A telegram had been sent several days ago by a member of the Graham county delegation,
asking the senator's advice, and his telegram today was, the reply, delayed in answer by the
senator's late arrival in Washington.
The view taken by the Texas statesman is that matters such as the recall and initiative
and referendum, if put in the final draft'of the constitution will probably invite disapproval
by Taft, and if not, then almost certain unfavorable action by congress.
The telegram has created a great sensation and is tonight the chief topic of conversa
tion among the delegates. The initiative and referendum were finally adopted this morn
ing, while final action on the recall will be taken tomorrow.
I FAVOR
OF PEACE TALK
IS IHE REPORT
Said to Have .Given Written
Order to the Governor of
Chihuahua to Treat With
The Committee
DOUGIiXS, Dec. C The surprising
Information Is received that D az
almseir has git en a written order to
Governor Sanchez, of Chihuahua, outh
orizlng him to support the commission
6ent to treat with tho rebels. Attor
ney Jesus Marin Gandara, of Chihua
hua, n an lntcniew with Diaz in Mex
lco City, explained the situation in
Chihuahua. Diaz then gave Gandara
a letter to Sanchez, giving moral sup!
port to the peace commiss'on Idea.
Gandara returned to Chihuahua
with the letter, in which Eduardo
Gonzales Is also mentioned, because
he broached the plan to Gandara be
fore tho latter's departure.
An odd situation resulted when
the specfal tra n bearing this commis
bion arrfvKT outside the town of Guer
rero and found tho rebels attacking
the place. The mission of the com-,
mission wi& stated to the rebel leadi
er, who very courteously replied: j
"Please excuse us untl we finish
the Job." I
Tho train was held while the at-'
tack proceeded and later tho rebels
agCn aked an extension of time.)
Then camo the notice of the arrival
of federal troops, following tho peace
commlss.on spec'al and the confer
encc ended.
The arrival In Chihuahua of Gen-
Juan A. Hernandez, commanding the
edcral troops, is of moro than pass
ing interest. Hernandez who led
the campaign against the "Yaqui In
dians under Chief Cajeme in an
Indian camp where they were t rtl I
fied under the direction of a French "
priest. Here 30f0 Indians routed
the Hernandez army of 2000 men.
Later Cajeme surrendered, making
jffers of peace. He left Martinez
to give tip his tribe, bdt was killed
on the way. Hernandez married
Mercedes Guereno, of Alamos, re
ported at one time fiance of Vice)
President Corral, then governor of
Sonora. I

Tbe movement began this afternoon,
some time after the publication r
the president's message, which was
in no sense a fiictor.
Indeed, conservative Wall Street
seemed disposed to extract much com'
fort from the president's recommend
ations, part-cularly from his plea that
no leg.s-atlon doal ng with thcregu
latlon or control of corporations be
enacted pending further test of exist

had sympathetic effect on Missouri

Great iJritian winch ha3 bsen the
sjurce of nearly continuous diplo

conention of 1S18, has given award
which is satisfactory to both parties.
This arbitration is particularly note
worthy in not only because of the
eralently Just results secured, but
also because it is the first arbitra
tion held under the general arbitra
tion treaty or April 4, 1898, by the
United States and Great Britian
and disposes ot a controversy, the
settlement or which has resisted
eicry other resource ot friction be
tween two countries whose common
interest lies in maintaining the most
friendly and cordial relations with
each other.
Appreciating these cnlightcnFd
tendencies of modern times, tho con
gress, at its last session passed a
law providing fr the appointment of
a rommlEsiou or five members "to
be appointed by the president of
the United States to consider the
expediency or uti'izing existing in

of limiting the armaments of tu
nations of the world by internatior.nl

diminish tbe expenditures of the
government for military purposer
and to lessen the probability of war."

it apply to the public building bill,
nor to the navy building program.
Of course, as to these congress

2" of this year, for the ordinary
OM)nt.cs of the government Inc'ud
mg thusr for public buildings, rivers
and harbors, and the navy building
urogram, amount to ?G30,494,013.
This is J52,9C1,8S7 less than the
appropriations ror the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1911. It is $10,
083453 less than tbe total esti
mates. Including supplemental csti
mates submitted by the treasury for
treasury for the year 1911, and is
Jj,574,6o3 less than the original esti
mates submitted b ythe treasury for
1911.
These figures do not include the
appropriations for the Panama canal,
ifcc policy in respect to which cught
to be, and Is, to spend as much each
year as can be economically and
effectively expended In order to com
plete tbe canal as promptly as pos
sible and therefore the ordinary mo
tive for cutting odwn the expense
or the government does not apply
to appropriations- for this purpose.
The estimates for the Panama canal
for the ensuing year aro more than
fifty-six mt.lloD3 of dollars an In--crease
of twenty millions over the
amount appropriated ror this year
a difference due to the fact that
the estimates for 1912 Include some
thing over nineteen millions for the
fortification of the canal.
Against the estimated expenditures
or $630,494,013 the treasury has esti
mated receipts for next year J6S0,
000,000, making a probable surplus
of ordinary receipts over ordinary
expenditures of about fifty millions,
or, taking into account the esti
mates for the Panama canal, which
are $U6,920,8-17 and which ultimately
will be paid In bonds. It will leave a
deficit for the nest year of about
J7.000.000, Ir Congress shall conclude
to rortify the canal. The cost of the
fortifications is about nineteen mil
lions. Should there bo no appropria
tions this year for fortifications,
then there would be, even Including
the Panama canal appropriation, a
surplus of about twelve millions ac-
