instead the name of Isham Harris.
Tlie amendment was voted down by a
party vote—yeas 29, nays 34, and Slier
man was without division declared duly
elected president pro tem.
Mr. Sherman and Mr. Harris both ab­

Edmunds and Voorhees and the oath of
ofiice was administered to him by Ed­
munds.

adjournment of the senate, "out of respect
to the memory of the late vice president."
At precisely noon the house was called
to order by .1. B. Clark, its clerk.
When order was secured the clerk pro­
ceeded to call the roll of members-elect.
While the roll was in progress a page en­
tered with a huge floral design, represent­
ing a section of a canal navigated by a
canal boat laden with diminutive bags of
grain,the whole being inscribed "Hennepin."
As lie placed it on the desk of Mr. Mur­
phy (Iowa), the especial champion ot the
Hennepin canal project, the house broke
out into applause and laughter.
The call disclosed the presence of 300
members, the only absentees being Miller
(N. Y.(, Henderson (N. €'.), Aiken (S. C.),
Page (Texas), and Croxston (Va.)
Nominations for speaker were then in or­
der, and Mr. Tucker was recognized, who
presented the name of John Oriliin Carlisle
(Ky.)
Messrs. Hiscock and Cannon then rose,
but the latter was recognized, and he placed
the name of Thomas B. Reed, (Me.) in nom­
ination.
Messrs. Morrison, Tucker, Hiscock, and
Brown (Ind.) were appointed tellers to
count the vote.
The result was announced as follows: For
Carlisle, 177 for Reed, 137 and aniid loud
applause the clerk declared Mr. Carlisle
elected, and appointed Messrs. Tucker and
Reed as a committee to conduct the speaker
to the chair.
On taking the chair Mr. Carlisle made a

A PERSONAL, CARD.
A-Matter in Which the Puollc Should
Have Deal ot Inter««t
To the readers of this paper.
Why does the government spend so
much money and risk so many lives
in trying to capture the counterfeiter?
"Suppose he does counterfeit gov­
ernment bonds and notes, surely the
government is rich enough to stand
any loss his act may confer!"
But the individual citizen could ill
afford to be put to continued financial
loss if such desperados were let go un
whipped of justice.
It is only the valuable thing that is
counterfeited it is only in the light of
purity and virtue that impurity and
vice can be known. No one in these
days would counterfeit a Confederate
bond or note.
People who commit fraud always
do it by simulating the highest virt|ie
by preying
011
the cleanest reputation,
by employing the fair name ot virtue
with which to give respectability to
vice.
Let us explain: Seven or eight years
ago, so we have been informed many
times in public
prints, a New York state
gentleman was pronounced, as many
millions have been pronounced before,
incurably sick of an extreme disorder.
By suggestions which he believed were
providential, he was led to the use of
a preparation which had been for sev­
eral years employed by a select few
physicians in New York city, and one
or two other prominent places. The
result was that lie was cured,he whom
doctors without number and of con­
ceded ability said was incurable. Hav­
ing secured possession of the formula,
absolutely and irrevocably, he deter­
mined to devote a portion of his ac­
cumulated wealth to the manufacture
and sale of this remedy for the benefit
of the many who suffer as he suffered,
in apparent hopelessness. In less than
three years,so tremendous became the
demand for this remedy and so exalted
the reputation, that he was obliged
for his purpose to erect a laboratory
and warehouse containing four and a
quarter acres of flooring and filled with
the most approved chemical and man
facturing devices. Probably there nev­
er was a remedy that has won such a
meritorious name, such extraordinary
sales, and has accomplished so much
good for the race.
Unprincipled parties who flourish
only upon the ruins of others, saw in
this reputation and sale an opportu­
nity to reap a golden harvest, (not
legitimately, not honorably) for which
purpose they have made imitations
and substitutions of it in every sec­
tion of the country, and many drug­
gists, who can make a larger profit on
these imitationgoods, often comprom­
ise their honor by forcing a sale upon
the unposted customer.
Yes undoubtedly the manufacturers
could well afford to ignore such in­
stances of fraud so far as the effect
upon themselves is concerned, for
their remedies have a constant and
unremitting sale but tliey feel it to be
their duty to warn tl»e public against
such imitations and substitutions
non-secret and otherwise. The indi­
vidual who buys them and the public
who countenances their sale alone
suffer in mind, body and estate there­
for.
The authors of some of these fraudu­
lent practices have been prosecuted
and sent to prison for their crimes,
but their is another class who claim
to know the formula of this remedy
and one Sunday scool journal, we are
told, has prostituted its high and holy
calling so far as to advertise that for
twenty-five cents it will send all new
subscribers a transcript of the Warner
formula! This formula, by the way,
must be a wonderfuly kaleidoscopic
affair, for there is hardly a month
passes when some paper is not issued
which pretends to give the only cor­
rect formula!
The manufacturers inform us that
they would be perfectly willing that
the public should know what the true
formula o! Warner's Safe Cure is, (none
that have been published are any­
thing like it), but even if every man,
woman and child in the United States
were as familiar with this formula as
with their A C's they could not
compound the remedy. The method
of manufacture is a secret. It is im­
possible to obtain the results that
are wrought by this remedy if one
does not have the perfect skill acquir­
ed only by years of practice, for com­
pounding and assimilating the simple
elements which enter into its compo­
sition.
The learned Dr. Foster, the honored
head of Clifton Springs sanitarium,
once said that having roughly an­
alyzed this remedy he recognized that
the elements that compose it were
simple but he attributed the secret of
its power to the method of its com­
pounding, and this method no one
knows except the manufacturers and
no one can acquire it.
Our advice to our readers, therefore,
cannot be to strongly emphasized.
As you would prefer virtue to vice,
gold to dross, physical happiness to
physical misery, shun the imitator
and refuse thereby to lend yonr aid
financially to those who seek to get,
by trading upon another's reputation
and honesty, a sale for wares and
goods which on their merits are fit
only to be rejected as the veriest re­
fuse. You can neither afford to pat­
ronize such people nor can you afford
to take their injurious compounds in­
to your system. When you call for
Warner's Safe Cure see that the wrap­
per is black with white letters and
that the wrapper and label bear an
imprint of an iron safe, the trade
mark, and that a safe is blown in the
back of the bottle and that a perfect
lc promniisory note stamp is over
the cork. You can't be imposed on if
you observe these cautions.
We have the highest respect for the
remedy we have mentioned and the
highest regard for the manufactures,
and we cannot to highly commend
their dignified and considerate tone in
relation to those who would traduce
their fair name and ruin the best in­
terest of the public in such matters.
Athlophoros always gives me relief from
rheumatism, and I am not troubled again
with the complaint, for months. A little
exposure brings it back again, but not as
severely as before using your remedy. Wm.

Struggles to Keep
in
Stylo.
It is an astonishing thingto observe
the style which New York men are oc­
casionally able to put on by dint of
stretching out an income which is ab­
surdly small. Small clerks, with sal­
aries of twelve dollars a week,
pay seven dollars of it for their
board, two dollars for their washing,
at least two dollars
for their car fares
and luncheons, and yet manage to
wear fashionable clothes. Some of
these well-dressed but impecunious
young men possess an amount of in­
formation about clothes, boots, hats,
and the like that astonishes men who
devote their time and thinl
cing to
graver thjngs, and even equals that of
the feminine dresser. They will go five
miles up town and patronize a little
shoemaker in aside street, because be
is cheap and has the nack of pasting
a patch 011 a shoe with such cleverness
that it is scacely visible. Most of them
have very old suits of clothes, which
they put on as soon as they arrive
down town, and they all shave them­
selves, black their own boots, smoke
cigarettes, go through no end of de­
privations and endure heart-rending
miseries that they may be able
to go with girls in the best
society. Lots of fun is made of them,
but, after all, they may be right, for
dress has a grajdt deal to do with a
man's success in New York. Business
men like to be surrounded by fashion­
ably clad and prosperous-looking
clerks, and the knowledge that he is
wearing good clothes always imparts
a certain amount of confidence to the
wearer. The merchant tailors along
Broadway and the better avenues
brag principally of the fit they give
their customers in return for a rather
liberal expenditure of money. It does
not do to go to a halfway tailor.
Even though I10 succeeds in fitting
you, there is sure to be a common
look about the clothes. An ordinary
suit, with a cut-away coat, made at
any one of the hundred or two Broad­
way tailors, will cost from fifty to
sixty dollars, and will look common­
place but durable. A similar suit
bought of a swell concern, would cost
seventy-five dollars, but it would be
distinctively fashionable in cut, and
have that peculiar air of distinction
which goes to make a fashionable
tailor's fortune.—Xew York CorreS'

Struck it Again.
Mt. Olivet (Ky.) Tribune, Nov. 19th.
If any doubt existed in this section as to
the genuine fairness of the Lousiana State
Lottery in making,' its monthly and semi­
annual distribution of prizes, that doubt
was dispelled Saturday night. A letter re­
ceived from a Cincinnati merchant in which
the following postscript was added: "I see
your town has again drawn capital prize
in Louisiana Lottery," was sufficient to
set our "city on the hills" in a blaze of ex­
citement. An indescribable hunt for ticket
holders ensued. Pocket-books, day-books,
desks, safes, trunks, valises, satchels, every­
thing was rummaged and tickets brought
forth. For a time,suspense prevailed, and
then the discovery was made that only one
list had Been received at the postoffice, ad­
dressed to S. H. Bettys. Mr. Bettys and
J. M. McDowell formed a partnership some
time ago in the purchase of tickets,agreeing
to divide profits, if any accrued. Mounting
ahorse bright and early Sunday morning,
McDowell went out throe miles in the coun­
try to see Bettys, and returning to town,
Bettys' ticket and the number on the list,
(46,799) corresponded. Going home in the
western suburbs of Olivet, they were soon
called on by the Tribune man, who wished
to learn the particulars. Examining the
ticket and list, we assured the parties that
they were each $7,500 richer than they
were previous to their last investment in
tbe Louisiana State Lottery.
The parties went to Maysville Monday
morning, and deposited their ticket for
collection with Pearce, Wallingford «& Co.,
of the State National Bank, the leading
bankers ol Northern Kentucky and South­
ern Ohio, and in a few days will receive a
check for their money.
Mr. Bettys informed us that he had been
holding a ticket regularly in the Louisiana
State Lottery for four or five years, with
the exception of a few monthly drawings,
and he would have invested in them if he
had had the money to spare. "I missed
last September drawing with much reluc­
tance," said he, "butl had very urgent need
of the dollar. I always recognized that the
chance of drawing the capital prizo was
meagre, but felt my chances were as good
as anybody else's. My faith is rewarded
after long years of deprivations by receiv­
ing a sufficiency ot money which, if judi­
ciously invested, will keep me in comfort­
able circumstances the remainder of my
days." He has been a teacher in the pub­
lic schools of Robertson since the
organiza­
tion of the county, at a salary ranging from
$20 to $40 per month. Many are the con­
gratulations he is receiving on his streak of
good fortune.
SinceMontgomerydrew $15,000 in April,
1884, and even since Bettys and McDowell
drew a similar amount in this month's
drawing, we have received numerous letters
from persons in several states and terri­
tories inquiring if the drawings were genu­
ine. In every instance we have taken pains
to answer these questions in the affirma­
tive, and we again repeat through the col
ums of the Tribune that these prizes were
actually drawn by the parties mentioned.
Montgomery purchased a farm near Mt.
Olivet, for the use of his brothers, paying
$3,000 therefor, and bought himself a farm
within one mile of Mt. Sterling, for which
he paid $9,500. Minor prizes, amounting
in the aggregate to $1,000 or over, have
been also drawn here, the largest ot these
prizes being drawn by M. D. Ellis andNim
rod Cumber, the former drawing $150 and
tbe latter $70. The Louisiana State Lot­
tery is a square institution, regardless o!
any doubts which may exist to the contrary.
POSTMASTER GENERAL VILAS' HOME.
Postmaster General Vilas hails from
Madison, Wis., and that extremely pretty
city is very proud of her handsome and
eloquent cabinet officer, who, at the time
he was chosen by Presidont Cleveland as
one ot his advisers, represented her in the
Wisconsin legislature. Madison is also
proud because she is the State Capital and
possesses a very imposing Capitol building
standing in a lovely park. Then Madison
inay also be proud of Wisconsin Univer­
sity, with its hundreds of students and
able faculty of the Soldiers' Orphans'
Home, of the State Lunatic Asylum build­
ings, and of the many industries which go
to make up the prosperity of the thriving
little capital. All these institutions have
grown up since 1836, at which time Madi­
son was in the wilderness. Pushing and
intelligent citizens have made her what she
is, and it is pleasant to observe that Madi­
son still possesses a very large proportion
ot clear-headed men and women, who ap­
preciate a good thing when they see it and
are glad to make its merits known.
One ot this class ofcitizens is L. A. Rog­
ers, the baggage-master of the Chicago,
Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad, who is
well known to all Madisoniuns and b,v a
large part of the traveling public. Mr.
Rogers has this to say of how he was cured
of a long-standing complaint:
"I suffered with rliumatism for some
time, so that it was with great pain that
I could move around at all, and I also
spent many sleepless nights. I am glad to
lay that after using two bottles of Athlo­
phoros I am entirely free from pain. No
one need suffer from rheumatism if they
will give it a fnir trial."
George W. Huntly, a dealer in groceries
at No. tt(5 Pinckney street, and a leading
merchant and old resident, commends the
medicine as follows:
"I have used Athlophoros for rheuma­
tism and can inoHl cheerfully say with the
most satisfactory results."
"Mary I. Whiting, of No. 810 University
avenue, who has lived in Madison for thir­
ty years and is known and respected by
every one, says:
"I have been a victim or severe rheuma­
tism for the past three years, and having
tried almost every remedy known without
any avail, I was much discouraged. Last
winter I was afflicted much worse than
over and was induced to try Athlophoros.
I am glad to state tliatl am now free from
pain and I pronounce the modicineaUod
sendfor the afflicted."
To those words of commendation may
be added those of Mr. T. R. Lutzow, a
well known citizen who says of Athlo­
phoros:
•'My wife was seriously afflicted with
rheumatism, principally in her arms. She
has now used two bottles of Athlophoros
and is well and free from pain. I can cheer­
fully recommend the remedy to my friends
and the public as being all that it claims to
be."
William Sommers, foreman for B. F.
McMillan & Bro., of McMillan, Wis., says
that seven bottles of Athlophoros relieved
him entirely of rheumatism of five years
standing, which was so
acute at times as to
compel him to give up work. Three bot­
tles entirely cured his brother-in-law, Louis
Ziinmering, whom rheumatism had com­
pelled to give up his place as edgerin a saw­
mill. He now fills his old position without
tho least inconvenience.

Contagious!
I am a native of England, and while I was in that
country I contracted a terrible blood poison, and for
two years was under treatment as an oat-door patient
at Nottingham Hospital. England, but was not cured.
I suffered the most agonizing pains in my bones, and
was covereit with soies all over my body and limbs.
Finally I completely lost all hope in that country, and
sailed for America, and was treated at Roosevelt in this
city, as well as by a prominent physician in New York
having no connection with the hospitals.
I saw the advertisement of Swift's Specific, and I de­
termined to rive it a trial. I took six bottles and I can
say with great joy that they have cured me entirely. 1
am as so
and and well as 1 ever was in my life.
New York City, Jane 12th, MS.
In March of last year (1884), I contracted blood prison,
and being in Savannah, Ga., at the time. I went into
the hospital there for treatment. 1
suffered very much
from rheumatism at thesame time. I did not get well
under the treatment there, nor was 1 cured by any of
the usual means. I have now taken seven bottles of
Swift's Speak and am sound and well. It drove the
at through boils on the akin.
