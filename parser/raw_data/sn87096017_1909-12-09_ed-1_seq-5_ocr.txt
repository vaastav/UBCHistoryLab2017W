With the chan#*d circumstances of the

I am happy to say that all but one
of the cases which for so long vexed
onr relations with Venezuela have
been settled within the past few
months and that, under the enlight
ened regime now directing the govern
ment of Venezuela, provision has been
made for arbitration of the remaining
ease before The Hagpe tribunal.
On. July 80, 1000, the government of
Panama agreed, after considerable ne
gotiation, to indemnify the relatives of
the American officers and sailors who
were brutally treated, one of them
having. Indeed, been killed by the
Panaman police this year.
This government was obliged to In
tervene diplomatically to bring about
arbitration or settlement of the claim
of the Emery company against Nica
ragua. which It had long before been
agreed should be arbitrated. settle
ment of this troublesome case was
"reached by the signature of a protocol'
on Sept. 18. 1000.
Many years ago diplomatic Interven
tion became necessary to the protec
tion of the Interests In the American
claim of Alsop &, Co. against the
government of Chile. The govern
ment of Chile had frequently admitted
obligation in the case and bad prom
ised this government to settle it. Then?
had been two abortive attempts to do
so through arbitral commissions, which
failed through lack of jurisdiction.
Now, happily, as the result of the re
cent diplomatic negotiations, the gov
ernments of the United States and of
Chile, actuated by the sincere desire
to free from any strain those cordial
and friendly relations upon which both
set such store, have agreed by a proto
col to submit the controversy to defin
itive settlement by his Britannic majes
ty Edward VII.
The Nicaraguan Trouble.
Since the Washington conventions of
1007 were communicated to the gov
ernment of the United States as a con
sulting and advising party this gov
ernment has been almost continuously
called upon by one or another and In.
turn by all of the five Central Amer
ican republics to exert itself for the
maintenance of the conventions. Near
ly every complaint has been against
the Zelaya government of Nicaragua,
which has kept Central America In
constant tension or turmoil. The re
sponses made to the representations of
Central American republics as due
from the United States on account of
its relation to the Washington conven
tions have been at ail times conserva
tive and have'avolded, so far as possi
ble. any semblance of Interference, al
though it is very apparent that the
considerations of geographic proximity
to the canal zone and of the very sub
stantial American interests in Central
America give to the United States a
special position in the zone of these
republics and the Caribbean sea.
1 need not rehearse here the patient
efforts of this government to promote
peace and welfare among these re
publics, efforts which are fully appre
ciated by the majority of them who
are loyal to their true Interests. It
would be no less unnecessary to re
hearse here the sad tale of unspeak
able barbarities and oppression alleged
to have been committed by the Zelaya
government. Recently two Americans
were put to death by order of Presi
dent Zelaya himself. They were offi
cers In the organized forces of a rev
olution which had continued many
weeks and was in control of about
-half of the republic, and as such, ac
cording to tne modern enlightened
practice of civilized nations, they were
entitled to be dealt with as prisoners
of war.
At the date when this message Is
printed this government has termi
nated diplomatic relations with the
Zelaya government for reasons made
public in a communication to the for
mer Nicaraguan charge d'affaires and
is intending to take such future steps
as may be found most consistent with
its dignity, its duty to American In
terests and. Its moral obligations to
Central America and to civilization, lit
may later be necessary for me to bring
this subject to the attention of the
congress in' a special message.
In the Far Eaet.
In the far east this government pre
serves unchanged its policy of support
ing th$ principle of equality of oppor
tunity and scrupulous respect for the
Integrity of the, Chinese empire, to
which policy are pledged the interest
ed powers of both east and west.
By thef treaty of 1903 China has un
dertaken the abolition of likin with a
moderate and proportionate raising of
the customs tariff along with currency
reform. These reforms being a mani
fest advantage to foreign commerce as
well as to the interests of China, this
government is endeavoring to facili
tate these measures and the needful
acquiescence of the treaty powers.
When It appeared that Chinese likin
revenues were to be hypothecated to
foreign bankers in connection with a
great railway project it was obvious
that tbe governments whose nationals
held this loan would have a certain
direct interest In the question of the
carrying out by China of the reforms
In question. The administration deem
ed American participation to be of
great national interest. Happily, when
It was as a matter of broad policy ur
gent that this opportunity should not
be lost, the indispensable instrumental
ity presented itself when a group of
American bankers of international
reputation aud great resources agreed
at once to share in the loan upon pre
cisely such terms as this government
should approve. The chief of those
terms was that American railway ma
terial should be upon an exact equality
with that of the other nationals join
ing in the loan in tbe placing of or
ders' for this whole railroad system.
After months of negotiation the equal
participation of Americans seems at
last assured.
In one of the Chinese-Japanese con
ventions! of Sept 1 of this year there
was a provision which caused consid
erable public apprehension la that
upon its face It Was believed In some
quarters to seek to establish a monop
oly of mining privileges along the
South MaUchurlan and Antung-Muk
den railroads and thus to exclude
Americans from a wide field of enter'
prise, to take part in Which they were
by treaty with China entitled. After
a thorough examination of the conven
tions and of the several contextual
documents the secretary of state reach
ed the conclusion that no such monop
oly was Intended or accomplished.
This government made Inquiry of tbe
Imperial Chinese and Japanese gov
ernments and received from each offi
cial assurance that the provision bad
no purpose inconsistent with the poli
cy of equality of opportunity to which
the signatories. In common with tbe
United States, are pledged.
Our traditional relations with the
Japanese empire continue cordial, as
usual. The arrangement of 1008 tor
a co-operative control of the coming
of laborers to the United States has
proved to work satisfactorily. The
matter of a revision of tbe existing
treaty between the United States and
Japan which is terminable in 1012 is
already receiving the study of both
countries.
The' Department of State.
I earnestly recommend to the favor
able action of the congress the esti
mates submitted by tbe department of
state and most especially the legisla
tion suggested in the secretary of
state's letter of this date whereby It
will be possible to develop and make
permanent the reorganization of tbe
department upon modern lines in a
manner to make It a thoroughly ef
ficient instrument In tbe furtherance
of our foreign trade and of American
Interests abroad.
Under a provision of the act of Aug.
5,1000. I have appointed three officials
to assist the officers of the government
in collecting information necessary to
a wise administration of the tariff act
of Aug. 8. 1000. As to questions of
customs administration they are co
operating with tbe officials of the
treasury department and as to matters
of the needs and tbe exigencies of our
manufacturers and exporters with the
department of commerce and labor in
its relation to the domestic aspect of
the subject of foreign commerce.
Aa a consequence of section 2 of the
tariff act of Aug. 5,1000, it-becomes the
duty of the secretary of state to con
duct as diplomatic business all the
negotiations necessary to place him In
a position to advise me as to whether
or not a particular country unduly dis
criminates against the United States
in the sense of the statute referred to.
Government ExpenJit'ures and Rev
enue*.
Perhaps the most important ques
tion presented to this administration
Is that of economy lu expenditures and
sufficiency of revenue.
Tbe report of tbe secretary shows
that tbe ordinary expenditures for tbe
current fiscal year eudlng June 30,
1010, will exceed the estimated re
ceipts by $34,075.(120. If to this deficit
are added tbe sum to be disbursed for
the Panama canal, amounting to $38,
000,000, and $1,000,000 to be paid on
the public debt, the deficit of ordinary
receipts and expenditures will be in
creased to a total deficit of $73,075,020.
This deficit tbe secretary proposes to
meet by tbe proceeds of bonds iBsued
to pay the cost of constructing the
Panama canal. I approve this pro
posal.
The Panama Canal.
The policy of paying for tbe con
struction of the Panama canal not
out of current revenue, but by bond
Issue, was adopted in the Spooner act
of 1902, and there seems to be no good
reason for departing from tbe princi
ple by which a' part at least of the
burden of the cost of the battel shalK
fall upon our posterity, who are to
enjoy it, and there is all the more rea
son for this view because the actual
cost to date of the canal, which is now
half done and which will be contpleted
Jan. 1, 1915. shows that the cost of
engineering .and construction will be
$207,766,000 Instead of $139,705,200, as
originally estimated. In addition to
engineering and construction, tbe oth
er expenses, including, sanitation and
government and the amount paid for
the properties, the franchise and the
privilege of building the canal, In
crease the cost by $75,435,000 to a
total of $375,201,000. The Increase in
the cost of engineering and construc
tion is due to a substantial enlarge
ment of the plan of construction by
widening the canal 100 feet in the Cu
iebra cut and by increasing the di
mensions of the locks, to the under
estimate of the quantity of the work
to be done under the original plan and
to an underestimate of the cost of la
bor and materials, both of which have
greatly enhanced In price 'since the
original estimate was. made.
Government Economy.
In order to avoid a deficit for the
ensuing fiscal year directed the
heads of departments in the prepara
tion of their estimates to make them
as low as possible consistent with Im
perative governmental necessity. The
result has been, as I am advised by
the secretary of the treasury, that the
estimates of the expenses of the gov
eminent for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1011—that is, for the next
fiscal year—are less by $55,663,000
than the total of appropriations for
tbe current fiscal year and less by
$94,000,000 than the estimates for that
year. So far as the secretary of the
treasury is able to form a judgment as
to future income, there will be no
deficit lu the year ending June 30,1911.
but a small surplus of $712,000.
In the present estimates the needs
of the departments and of tbe gov
ernment have been cut to the quick.'.
For the purpose of securing informa
tion hich may enable the executive
and the legislative branches to unite
In a plan for the permanent reduction
oi the cost of governmental adminis
tration the treasury department has
instituted an investigation by one of
the most skilled expert accountants in
the United States. The object of the
investigation is to devise means to in
crease the average efficiency of each
employee. There Is great room for im
provement-toward this end, not only
by the reorganization of bureaus and
departments and in the avoidance of
duplication, but also in tbe treatment
of the Individual employee.
Under the present system It constant
ly happens that two employees receive
the same salary when tbe work of one
is far more difficult and important and
exacting than that of tbe other. Su
perior ability Is not rewarded or en
couraged.
Civil Pensions.
Aa tbe degree of efficiency In all tbe
departments Is much lessened by tbe re
tention of old employees who have out
lived their energy and usefulness it
Is Indispensable to. any prope* system
at
economy that provision be made so
that their separation from the service
shall be enxy aud hierltnMe. ix i.n
possible to make such provision unless
there Is adopted a plan of civil pen
sions. We cannot. In view of tbe ad
vancing prices of living, hope to save
money by a reduction In the standard
of salaries paid. Indeed. If any change
Is made in that regard an Increase
rather than a decrease will be neces
sary, and the only means of economy
will be in reducing the number of
employees and in obtaining a greater
average of efficiency from those re
tained In the service.
Frauds In the Collection of Custom*.
I regret to refer to the fact of the
discovery of extensive frauds In tbe
collection of the customs revenue at
New York city, in wblch a number of
the subordinate employees in the
weighing and other departments were
directly concerned and In which tbe
beneficiaries were the American Sugar
Refining company a'nd others. The
frauds consisted in tbe payment of du
ty on underweights of sugar. The gov
ernment has recovered from tbe Amer
ican. Sugar Refining company all that
It is shown to have been defrauded of.
The sum was received In full of the
amount due which might have been
recovered by civil action against the
beneficiary of the fraud, but there was
an excess reservation In the contract
of settlement by which tbe settlement
should not Interfere with or prevent
the criminal prosecution of every one
who was found to be subject to the
same.
Criminal prosecutions are now pro
ceeding against a number of the gov
ernment officers. The treasury de
partment and tbe department of jus
tice are exerting every effort to dis
cover all the wrongdoers. Including the
officers and employees of the compa
nies who may have been privy to tbe
fraud. It would aeem to me that an
Investigation of the frauds by con
gress at present, pending tbe probing
by tbe treasury department and the
department of justice, as proposed,
might by giving Immunity and other
wise prove an embarrassment in se
curing conviction of tbe guilty parties.
Maximum and Minimum Clause In
Tariff Act.
Two features of the. new tariff act
call for special reference. In order
that the maximum duty shall be charg
ed against the imports from a country
it Is necessary that the executive shall
find on tbe part of that country not
only discriminations in Its laws or the.
practice under them against tbe trade
of tbe United States, but that tbe dis
criminations found shall be undue—
that is. without good and fair reason.
No one is seeking a tariff war or a con
dition in which the spirit of retaliation
shall be aroused.
TartfF Readjustment.
The new tariff law enables me to ap
point a tariff board to assist me in con
nection with tbe department of state in
the administration of the minimum and
maximum clause of the act and also to
assist officers of tbe government In the
administration of the entire law. 1 be
lieve that the work of this board will
be of prime utility and importance
whenever congress shall deem it wise
again to readjust the customs duties.
If the facts secured by the tariff board
are of such a character as to show gen
erally that the rates of duties imposed
by tbe present tariff law are excessive
under the principles „of, protection as
described In the platform of the suc
cessful party at the late election 1
shall not hesitate to invite the atten
tion Of congress to this fact and to tbe
necessity for action predicated there
on. Nothing, however, halts business
and Interferes with the course of pros-,
perity so much as the threatened revi
sion of the tariff, and until the facts
are at hand, after careful and deliber
ate investigation, upon wblch such re
vision can properly be undertaken, it
seems to me unwise to attempt it.
War Department.
In the interest of immediate econ
omy I have required a reduction In
the estimates of tbe war dep» -tmerit
for tbe coming fiscal year which
brings tbe total estimates down to nn
amount forty-five millions less tli:i
the corresponding estimates for Insi
year. This could be accomplished onl.v
by cutting off new projects and sus
pending for the period of one year al!
progress in military matters. Kor the
same reason I have directed that the
army shall not be recruited up to It*
present authorized strength. These
measures can hardly be more than
temporary, for I am sure that the In
terests of the military establishment
are seriously in need of careful con
sideration by congress.
The secretary of war calls attention
to a number of needed changes in the
army, in all of which 1 concur, but the
point upon which 1. place most em
phasis is the need for an elimination
bill providing a method by which tbe
merits of officers shall have some ef
fect upon their advancement aud b.v
which the advancement of all may be
accelerated by the effective elimination
of a definite proportion of the least
efficient.
Tbe military and naval joint board
have unanimously agreed that It would
be unwise to make the large expendi
tures which at one time were contem
plated in the establishment of a naval
base and station in the Philippine Is
lands and have expressed their judg
ment. in which I fully concur, in fa
vor of making an extensive uaval base
at Pearl Harbor, near Honolulu, and
got In tbe Philippines.
The Navy.
The return of the battleship fleet
from its voyage around the world in
more efficient condition than when it
started was a noteworthy event of in
terest alike to our citizens and the
naval authorities of tbe world. The
marked suqpess of the ships in steam
ipg around tbe world In all weathers
on schedule time has increased respect
for our navy and has added to our na
tional prestige.
It is a regrettable fact that tbe
higher officers are old for the respon
sibilities of the modern navy, and tbe
admirals do not arrive at flag rank
young enough to obtain adequate train
ing In their duties aa flag officers.
Owing to the necessity for economy
In expenditures, I have directed tbe
curtailment of recommendations for
naval appropriations so that they are
thirty-eight millions less than the cor
responding estimates of last year, and
tbe request tor new naval construction
Is limited to two first claas battleships
and one repair vessel.
tbe secretary of the navjr has loan-
gurated a tentative plan Involving cer
tain changes In tbe organization of tbe
navy department, including tbe navy
yards, all of which have been found
by tbe attorney general to be in ac
cordance with law. I have approved
the execution of tbe plan proposed be
cause of tbe greater efficiency and
economy It promises.
Department of Ju*tie«—Expedition In
Legal Procedure.
Tbe deplorable delays In the admin
istration of civil und criminal law have
received the attention of committees of
the American Bar association and of
many state bar associations as well as
the considered thought of judges and
Jurists. In my judgment, a change In
public procedure, with a view to re
ducing its expense to private litigants
In civil cases and facilitating tbe dis
patch of business and final decision In
both civil and criminal cases, consti
tutes the greatest need in our Ameri
can Institutions. 1 do not doubt for
one moment that much of tbe lawless
violence and cruelty exhibited In lynch
Ings are directly due to tbe uncertain
ties and Injustice growing out of the
delaya in trials, judgments and tbe exe
cutions thereof by our courts.
I therefore recommend legislation
providing for tbe appointment by the
president of a commission with author
ity to examine tbe law and equity
procedure of the federal courts of first
Instance, tbe lair of appeals from
those courts to tbe courts of appeals
and to tbe supreme court and the costs
imposed in such procedure upon the
private litigants and upon tbe public
treasury and make recommendation
with a view to simplifying and ex
pediting tbe procedure as far as pos
sible and making it as Inexpensive as
may be to tbe litigant of little means.
The platform of the successful party
In tbe last election contained tbe fol
lowing:
Injunction's Without Notice.
"We believe that the rules of proce
dure in the federal courts with respect
to tbe issuance of tbe writ of injunc
tion should be more accurately defined
by statute and that no injunction or
temporary restraining order should be
issued without notice, except wbere
'Irreparable trijury would result from
delay. In which case a speedy hearing
thereafter should be granted."
I recommend that In compliance with
tbe promise thus made appropriate leg
islation be adopted. Moreover, every
such injunction or restraining order
Issued without previous notice and op
portunity h.v tbe defendant to be beard
should by force of tbe statute expire
and be of no effect after seven days
from the Issuance thereof or within
any time less than that period which
the court uiay fix unless within such
seven days or such less period tbe in
junction or order is extended or re
newed after previous notice and op
portunity to be heard.
Anti-trust and Interstate Commerce
Laws.
The jurisdiction of the general gov
ernment over interstate commerce has
led to the passage of the so called
"Sherman anti-trust law" and the "in
terstate commerce law" and Its
amendments. Tbe developments in tbe
operation of those laws call for a dis
cussion and some suggestions as to
amendments. These I prefer to em
body In a special message.
Poatoffiee Department Second Cla**
Mail Matter.
The deficit every year In the post
office department Is largely caused by
tbe low rate of postage of 1 cent a
pound charged on second class mall
matter, which includes not only news
papers. but magazines and miscella
neous periodicals. The actual loss grow
ing out of tbe transmission of this
second class mail matter at 1 cent a
pound amounts to about $03,000,000 a
year. The average cost of tbe trans
portation of this matter is more than
9 cents a pound. The statistics of 1907
•bow that second class mail matter
constituted 63.91 per cent of tbe
weight of all tbe mail and yielded
only 5.19 per cent of the revenue.
The figures given are startling and
show the payment by the government
of an enormous subsidy to tbe news
papers, magazines and periodicals. A
great saving might be made, amount
ing to much more than half of tbe loss,
by imposing upon magazines and peri
odicals a higher rate of postage.
Postal 8avings Bank*.
I believe postal savings banks to be
necessary in order to offer a proper
inducement to tbrift a (id saving to a
great many people of small means who
do not now have banking facilities and
to whom such a system would offer an
opportunity for the accumulation of
capital. They will furnish a satisfactory
substitute, based on sound principle
and actual successful trial in nearly
all the countries of the world, for the
system of governmeut guaranty of
deposits now being adopted in several
western states which, with deference
to those who advocate it. seems to me
to have In it the seeds of demoraliza
tion to conservative banking and cer
tain financial disaster.
8hip Subsidy.
Following the course of my distin
guished predecessor. I earnestly rec
ommend to congress the consideration
and passage of a ship subsidy bill.
Interior Department—New Mexico and
Arizona.
Tbe successful party in tbe last elec
tion in Its national platform declared
In favor of tbe admission as separate
states of New Mexico and Arizona,
and 1 recommend tbat legislation ap
propriate to this end be adopted.
Alaska.
With respect to tbe .territory of Alas
ka, 1 recommend legislation which
ahall provide for the appointment by
the president of a governor and also
of an executive council, tbe members
of which shall during tbelr term of
office reside in tbe territory and which
shall have legislative powers sufficient
to enable it to give to tbe territory lo
cal laws adapted to Ita present growth.
I strongly deprecate legislation looking
to the election of a territorial legisla
ture in that vaat district.
Conservation of Natural Resource*.
In several departments there is pre
sented the necessity for legislation
looking to the further conservation of
onr national resources, and the sub
ject is one of such importance aa to
require a more detailed and extended
discussion than can be entered upon
In this communication. For that rea-

Bureau of Health.
There seems to be no reason why all
the bureaus and offices in tbe general
government which have to do with
tbe public health or subjects akin
thereto should not be united in a bu
reau to be called the "bureau of pub
lic health."
Political Contribution*.
I urgently recommend to congress
that a law be passed requiring tbat
candidates in elections of members of
the house of representativea and com
mittees in charge of their candidacy
and campaign file in a proper office of
the United States government a state
ment of the contributions received and
of the expenditures Incurred In the

in a high state of prosperity. Ttiere is
every reason to believe tbat we are ou
the eve of a substantial bualness ex
pansion. and we have just garnered
harvest unexampled in tbe market val
ue of our agricultural products. The
high prices which such products bring
mean great prosperity for tbe farming
community but. on tbe other bund,
tbey mean a very considerably Increas
ed burden upon thoae claaaes iu the
community whose yearly compensation
does not expand with tbe improvement
In business and the general prosfierlty.
Various reasons are given for tbe high
prices. Tbe proportionate increase in
the output of gold, wblch today is tbe
chief medium of exchange and la in
aome respects a measure of value, fur
nishes a substantial explanation of at*
least part of tbe lncreaae in prices.'
The Increase in population and the
more expensive mode of living of the
people, which have not been accom
panied by a proportionate Increase In
acreage production, may furnish a fur
ther reason. It Is well to note thrt the
Increase In tbe cost of living is not
confined to this country, but prevails
the world over, and tbat those who.
would charge Increases In prices to the'
existing protective tariff must meet
tbe fact tbat the rise in prices has
taken place almost wholly In those,
products of tbe factory and term In:
respect to which there baa been either1
no Increase In the tariff or In many
instances a very considerable redur-.
tion.
