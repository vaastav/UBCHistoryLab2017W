The Coming Session of Congress.
"Within a few days the annual mes
sage of the president of the United j
States tv congress will be laid before j
the people. Abstracts of the reports j
of the heads of departments have been |
pretty generally published. The his
tory of the operations of the navy in |
Mon with the recent war has ;
li-. n already told by Secretary Long. '
That <»f the operations of the army has j
been v>ld by the report of Secretary :
Alger during the past few days. The j
activity of these two martial branches |
of the service has been so conspicuous
duiing the past eight or nine months
that the people generally are Informed |
up''ii all interesting points involved in |
the campaign. The country has passed j
i .int of theoretical acceptance of i
results; all that can be expected from i
of the president is a practi- j
cal review of facts already known. 1
Judging from the past policy of Presi- j
d( at McKinley, it is fair to assume
that he will be just as wavering and
lugubrious In his statements as he :
Luring hia night across one-half
the continent from Washington to
Omaha and hack, and that there will
c 'legree of hesitancy as to I
forceful recommendation and treat
ment of the important subjects in
volved.
Prx Bident McKinley has manifested |
a lack of backbone at every point
when be has been brought squarely in
contact with a question that demand
ed prompt executive action calculated
to remove uncertainty in the public
mind. H' j was vacillating during all
the negotiations previous to the war;
the reports of the heads of the mili
tary departments prove tha-t he was
always shrinking in his views as to
what should be done in the prosecution
or the war; the records of the war de- I
partmtnt. associated with the quarter- i
master's and commissary, bureaus, re
\<al him as an executive trusting j
rather t<» chance than to the authority i
which he possessed as the commander- I
in-chief, and altogether his adminis- i
tration l>*-;irs resemblance to one who, !
while compelled to rise to the dignified I
performance of duty, prefers rather j
t'> seek refuge in a fluke.
The president's message, as suggest
ed, can throw little in the way of light
upon what has already gone before,
but it ought to advance considerable
knowledge, in view of the entangled
condition of affairs in which the coun
try finds itself at the present time.
The people may expect a beautifully
rounded message, but possessed of all
the hollowness of an inflated bladder;
and that id what they will probably
receive.
Tlia Central Amsr.can Collapse.
The trouble with those Central Amer
ican Cederationista was that they went
at it in the wrong way. They wasted
their time and energy providing for the
Herds of a stable government. A stable
government in Central America can
never be anything but an accident and
BO remote a possibility that there Is
no need of worrying about it. A federal
law governing the prosecution as
vagrants of stray visitors from the
solar system would be a model of util
ity compared with rules for a Central
American union in time of peace. The
Nikola Tesla of the Nicaragua region
Will be some daring genius who will
keep the current of affairs from stray
ing when the usual Saturday afternoon
revolution comes around. That is the
crying need of the hour, and because
overlooked it the promoters of the
Imitation United States found their
federation a failure before it had had
a chance to get on ..he pay roll.
The problem, hoy ever, Is not such a
difficult one. A constitution that will
recognize the inherent and inalienable
right of every citizen of Central
America to revolt whenever the idea
overtakes him can become the great
benefactor of the section. Only a few
simple sections are essential. The de
tail can ea-sily be worked out, but even
if it is not it will make no gfreat dif
ference, for the constitutional em
broidery will be useful only in time of
quiet, and that is bo rare as scarcely
to constitute a factor. Central Amer
ica can get along nicely with a con
stitution something after this style:
The term of the president shall cover three
eonsecutho days, if Le is assassinated in
tlie meantime, the assassin will assume iha
functions for the unexpired term.
The vice president shall preside over the
sessions of the federal diet and be ex-oiii
cio the head of all revolutions.
In the 1 rent of revolution in any state of
the < onfederation. the other states ehatj also
fc-tart revolutions. At the end of a v.et>k the
faction having won the most victories shall
appoint ■ jiic-siucnt and the onion will ciart
over again.
In the event c. r the president serving out
his full term or passing away from natural
causes the federation will be dissolved and
the component states will resume th;?ir
rae sovereignty.
This outline can be filled in with a
tew articles about taxes and laws and
elections as may seem desirable. They
are not important anyway. Upon such
s; Bftfc and solid basis of constitutional
law a. Ctntral American republic might
be expected to work for even as long
as a month.
Barrel Organ Art.
Boston is again the pioneer in a
great movement for the uplifting of
art. The police powers of the Hub are
to be exerted for art for art's sake. The
humble hand organ and the hilarious
hurdy-gurdy are the objects of reform.
| The little German band is in it, too.
I The cultured ears of Boston In future
will not be jarred by the jangling of
"sweet bells out o' tune." From now
on Boston street music must be played
in tune or not played at all. When the
policeman on the corner detects a false
note in Op. 57, arranged for the barrel
organ, there will be trouble, and, if
the shading in "The Flying Dutchman"
runs too much to high lights when the
he nest Teutons perform before the ale
j house, the police patrol will be trans
t formed Into a band wagon.
It is natural that Boston should lead
in this reform. In Chicago, when the
| Italian impresario is grinding out that
i popular melody "My Papa Swings a
Cleaver in the Stockyards," it is a
small matter if a few false notes min
gle in the melody. In New York the
street piano man may rattle away at
"Billy Bunked a Jay Down in the J
Bowery," and if his touch is not all j
that it should be in the way of tech
nique no one will mind. The street
band in Milwaukee can blare out "Beer
Is .Xever Dear Down by the Brewery,"
and no one will detect that the tuba is
half a tone sharp. But not so in Bos
ton. Boston knows what's what.
Where the hurdy-gurdy man's reper
toire is confined to Chopin, and the
hand organ plays Wagner for popular
encores, music is music, and the man
who hurrys the time in "Little Emer
son Has Eaten the Only Bean" knows
just what to expect. Where the street :
gamin whistles impromptus in A
major or B first sergeant and the hand
organ monkey is grounded in thorough
bass, false notes are no better than
they are at a bank.
But even Boston has only made a
beginning. There are other things to
be reformed before the cultured city
can live its life in one long harmony.
Not until the tamale man announces his ;
wares in chest tone tenor, and the red
hot breaks upon the world in basso pi-o
fundo will the Back bay rest in peace.
When "Fresh fish" sounds in limpid
arias and "Glass put in" is set to Wag
nerian music; when the trolley cars
rattle along to the notes of the inter
mezzo and the knife grinder renders
symphonies upon his wheel, then life
in Boston will be one long sweet sum
mer day.
Gen. Butterfleld's Colonial Views.
There are likely to be many proposi
tions forthcoming regarding the best
method of treating the new colonies
which have been acquired already by
the United States, and which are pos
sible of acquisition, as the result of
the Spanish war.
Gen. Daniel Butterfield, of New-
York, comes forward with a suggestion
that the constitution of the United
States will probably have to be so
amended as to prohibit admission to the
Union as states of these outlying com
munities, which are so largely popu
lated by a class of people entirely un
instructed in our form of government,
as well as the real duties of eltizeii
[ ship which would devolve upon them.
j The social conditions of those who
; represent, as individuals, the element
j that would go to the creation of laws
• for their own commonwealth govern
j merit are not such as entitle them, ac
i cording to his views, to the high func
i tions of self-government without some
national restraint.
Gen- Butterfield proves himself to be
a thoughtful man in the matter of
dealing with this important and most
vexing problem. He has, with calm
ness and moderation, voiced a con
servative sentiment which will doubt
less attract much attention when the
debates in congress begin.
This is a growing climate all the
year round. The ice is growing now.
All New York artists are now paint
ing snow scenes. They can't get any
where to paint anything else.
Senator Hansbrough is unique. He
: is the only United States senator who
i ever had to buy his own paper.
Death is- one of the cheapest things
!to be had in Manila. Thirty-live ci
! garettes can be purchased fur a Cent.
The most serious thing about thi3
Philippine business is the fact that
it has set the tongues of Senator
Chandler and Hannis Taylor to wag
ging.
There is a great rear for stable gov
ernment in Cuba, It isn't likely Cuba
v ill get any government above the
barnyard variety until its people grow
in intellect.
Ten thousand sheop are snowbound
in Oregon. How many are in the same
condition in the streets of New York
will not be known until the reports
are tabulated.
Why doesn't the Minneapolis Journal
| break into its own "Home Study Cir
cle?" It ha& recently become obvious
to everybody that the Journal has a
great deal to learn.
Having acquired 6,000,000 savages, it
would perhaps be the proper thing to
withdraw all our missionaries else
where and concentrate them In the
Philippines and Carolines.
A Minneapolis woman has asked a
St. Cloud man for $5,000 damages for
promising at a summer school to mar
ry her. They met seven times.
Oughtn't he to have the $5,000.
Gen. Lacret, Any Old Place, Cuba-
Respected Sir: If you don't want us
to cut the first word out of this last re
ina-k, please have your post-prandial
speeches carefully edited hereafter.
Oshkosh's sheriff claims that the re
cent strike cost him $5,300. Strikes are
plainly too costly for him, but he
doesn't know whether it is financilly
best for him to stop them or to let them
go on.
Bog-Ah-Ma-Geshik would be a good
man to interview on the acquisition of
the Philippines. Volunter-rs for the job
of interviewing him will please step
forward. Those having Gatling guns
preferred.
Through the- Door.
"So poor old Fleecy Is gone, eh?"
"Yes; he did not consult a physician until
he was at death 3 door."
"And the dot tor pulled him through!"

IHE ST. PAUL GLOBE—MONDAY DECEMBER 5, 1893.
Written Around Mr. Line/.
Get Rid of tbe Hlmr.
Gov. Llnd'a first act should be to turn out
the whole ring that ruled and robbed the
state since its organization.—Montgomery
Messenger.
Likes the Humor.
In regard to appointments, Gov.-elect Lind
la going to adopt the motto. "To the,victors
belong the spoils." Again we say, bully for
Lind.—Sauk Rapids Free Press.
Mr. Lind Appreciates It.
Tl.e Minneapolis Times with characteristic
generosity and kindness has made Mr. LinJ'g
new duties very simple by making hia ap
pointments for him. —St. Peter Herald.
How About RetnrnlnK Thanks?
J. Adam Bede doesn't want any nrayers
offered in the legislature halls of Minnesota
thU session. No need of prayers this year, J.
Adam. Lind Is elected.—Norwood Times.
Gov. Lind Has the Last Say.
The Twin City Republican dailies have bean
making Gov. Llnd's appointments to suit
j themselves. The governor may have aonie
j thing to say about the matter later on.—Lam
berton Star.
Not Elected by Mistake.
John Lind was not elected by mistake or
fraud or deception, but by the people of th©
state who are throwing off party slavery and
worship. John Lind is all right.—Waieca
County Herald.
Dockage of Officers.
When Mr. Lind takes the governor's chair
it is_.expected that among the first things that
he will do will be to order a heavy dockage
of officers in tifca wheat Inspection depart
ment.—Western Guard.
Scandinavian Vote.
The cry that the Scandinavian vote elected
Lind makes us "tired." In Belmont, a solid
, Scandinavian town, Euatia got 78 votes and
j John Land 3», while in Sioux Valley, that has
not a dozen Scandinavians within its borders,
I Lind got 56 votes and Eusiis 16. —Jackson Re
public.
Xelaon's Work for Lind.
Senator Knute Nelson delivered forty
speeches in the recent voting campaign, and
every voting precinct in which he spoke gave
John Lind an increased vote over two years
ago. This Indicates that the Influence of the
little Norwegian king is waning.—Glencoe
Enterprise.
Wrong Prescription.
If some of these Republican papers that are
endeavoring to make up a slate for John
Lind would only wake up to the idea that
this is no matter of theirs at all, it would
save them a lot of explaining after Jan. I
Perhaps John needs advice, but Republican
advice is not quite what the doctor ordered
in this case.—Le Sueur Sentinel.
Doesn't Woltfer \eed Him f
An important question among local Demo
crats and supporters of Lind just now is how
Washington county will fare in the distribu
tion of plums. This city can boast of a can
didate for game warden and state librarian
and any number of candidates for the Bur
veyor generalship, among them J. S. O'Brien,
the present incumbent.—Washington County
Journal.
John Llnd'B Triumph.
John Lind gave up his profession and
tendered his services to Uncle Sam In the in
terest of his country and returned from the
front to be tendered the highest position our
state could offer. This may look encouraging
to Col. Bryan, who started out on a similar
journey as Honest John, lmt the result, how
ever, can never be the same.—Plalnview
NTws.
Fonu'ht on State Issues.
Mr. Lind very wisely forced needed state
issues to the front. The matter of railroad
extortions and discriminations, the binding
twine robbery of last summer, the warehouse
management and the false grading of wheat,
our bank failures and the bank examiner's
duties, all these and other state matters were
proper issues, as every intelligent man
knows, in our state canvass.—Waseca County
Herald.
Cause of Republican Anxiety.
A Republican exchange climbs onto the
band wagon with the comment that "John
Lind is a level-headed man and will make a
good governor." That is just the trouble.
Lind will in all probability give the state a
good administration, and his very success
will come dangerously near getting a lot of
other fellows into the legislature, state offices
and even into the United States senate who
are not so level-headed.—-Freeborn County
Times.
C'litince for n. GiMts,
Just before election one of our valued ex
changes emphasized these words: "No Re
publican who believes in Republican princi
ples can vote for John Lind." Assuming that
this was so, a careful estimate on the re-
I turns forces us to one of three conclusions:
I Either that the Republican party in Minne
sota is in the minority by fully 20.0C0. or
that there are twenty odd thousand Repub
licans in Minnesota who do not believe in Re
publican jrinciples, or else —or else —our
valued exchange was wrong. But how can a
Republican newspaper be wrong?— Montevideo
Leader.
Miuhi Get Tlniberlake's Place.
Red Lake county ought to be recognized
by Gov. Lind when he comes to making his
appointments. No county in the state gave
him a better percentage of the total vote —
receiving 1,084 to 422 for Eus-tis, a plurality
of G62. The Gazette suggests that the Popu
lists of the county unite on EL E. Ives for
some important position. Mr. Ives made the
race for senator against peculiar conditions
that would have deterred many another, and
his many friends In Red Lake county would
like nothing better than to see him reci>g
nized by the governor. No other Populist in
the county could present better qualifica
tions. By reason of practical experience of
many years in the Insurance business, would
lie be especially fitted for a position in that
department.— Red Lake Falls Gazette.
A Plain Cane.
"I know you have been defeated for con
stable," said the candidate's wife, as he
crawled in at 2:30 a. m., very quietly.
J'l'd like to know what you know about
It," he snapped.
"Well, you didn't come tearing up stairs
and invite me to salute the next president
of the United States."—Philadelphia North
American.
Suspected a.s Much.
Wallace—Did you know that rubber can be
made from Indian corn?
Hargrcaves—Never heard of it before,
though some of the corncakes at our boarding
house Indicate as much. —Cincinnati Enquirer.
Itnsy Killing Stagre Villains.
Actor James O'Neill has played the Count
of Monte Crlsto 4,000 times. In his time,
therefore, he has assisted at the killing of
12,000 stase villains. Th!s is a record of
which any man could be proud.—Chicago
Tribune.

—Cleveland Leader.
Here, There, Everywhere.
There is a good prospect for a renewal of
the Schley-Sampson unpleasantness In the rec
ommendation of the secretary of the navy
that the grades ot qdmiral and vice admiral
be revived "to be flUed by such officers as it
may be the pleasure of the president, by and
with the consent of the senate, to aopolnt."
Of course, there will be no doubt as to the
ofiicer who will ;be appointed admiral. The
victory of Manila bay settled that. But
when it comes to the selection of the vine
admiral the partisans of Sampson and of
Schley will don war paint again and the bat
tle will rage in the White house and be con
tinued in the sen^ate.-r-Chicago Chronicle.

If Mr. McKinley's new flying machine, "Im
perialism," coiues up. to his expectations, It
will sustain this weight of alien races:
Indians 250,000
C'-'ored in America 5,000,000
Chinese in America , 100.0UO
Hawaiians ", 100.000
Porto Ricans 750,000
Cubans 1,500,000
Filipinos of various yellow and black
breed* 8,000.000
Total 18,700,000
And here at home we have a foreign-born
population of European origin, assiniilabla
but not yet wholly assimilated, of 9.000.000.
For a government which has universal suf
frage as one foundation and "consent of the
governed" as the other foundation this Is
certainly a profoundly interesting 3howing.—

A messenger came tearing up to the White
house in '63 and, hurriedly gaining admis
sion to Mr. Lincoln, informed him in great
excitement that a large wagon train had been
surprised a short ways across the Potomac
and a brigadier general taken prisoner.
"Did they capture the train?" inquired
Old Abe.
"No, sir, the regiment came up and saved
it," answere-d the messenger, "but the gen
eral, Mr. President, is a prisoner."
"Oh, never mind that," said Lincoln. "I
can make a dozen generals in a day, but
mi/les cost $300 apiece."—What to Eat.

The phrase "open door" has been used
only with reference to possessions of Eu
ropean powers on Asia's east coast. Originat
ing in the treaty or "open" ports of China
and Japan, the words have been extended
to cover ports China leased or surrendered
to foreign powers. The term means that In
such ports the alien government has imposed
no discrimination in tariff or navigation
charges, but has treated the imports and ves
sels of other cov"tr}*-s just as it has treated
its own. In other words, foreign powers hold
ing Chinese ports have merely announced
that they will keep such ports open just as
China has opened certain free ports to the
commerce of nations, without discrimination
or favor.

A lawyer's advertisement la the Arizona
Kicker runs thus:
Come to Maj. Hopkins to get full satisfac
tion. Office over Brown's drug store and
office hours from sunrise to sunset. No ob
jection to turning out at midnight to do bus
iness. I am entitled to practice in every court
in Arizona, and I win nine-tenths of my
cases. If you want to sue—if you have beeu
sued—l am the man to take your case. Em
bezzlement, highway robbery, felonious as
sault, arson and horse stealing don't amount
to shucks if you have a good lawyer behind
you. My strong point is weeping as I appeal
to the jury, and I seldom fail to clear my
man. Out of tlc-ven murder cases in hand
last year I cleared nine of the murderers, and
would have made a clean sweep If the other
two hadn't begged to be hung In order to
I get out of the territory.
I have at present live libel suits against
the Arizona Kicker, and am the only law
yer In town whom the editor cannot bull
doze. My charges are reasonable, and when
I take a case I push It for all it is worth.
Having been in jail no less than four time 9
myself, my experience cannot fail to prove
of value to my clients. Come early and
avoid the rush.

Gov.-elect Lind, of Minnesota, who carried
a state solidly Republican for forty yeirs

All of the Thanksgiving day sermons in
favor of expansion we cannot praise, but
the one preached in Washington by the Rev.
Dr. Radcltffe is much to our mind. He
showed great ingenuity in hLs rhoce of a
text, which i.s always half th.» battle. This
was taken from the prohpet Amos, ""Behold,
a basket of fruit." This at once made it
easy to claim Divine warrant for regarding
Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines as so
much "fruit" "placed in the basket of Amer
ica by the hand of Providence." At the
same time it put the preacher neatly in llDe
with the president's plaintive question,
""What are we going to do with the fruits of
victory?" What but put them to our basket?
Some one might say that the Monroe doc
trine would prevent us, but Dr. Radclllfe
was ready for that wicked objector: "The
Monroe doctrine has given way to the Mc-
Kinley doctrine, and while the name of Mon
roe was great, the name of McKinley will
be greater." There have been many doubts
what the Monroe doctrine really is, but
there need never be any uncertainty, after
this, what the McKinley doctrine is. It is,
"Let me hold tin? basket and I care not who
I shakes the fruit into It."—New York Evening
Post.

The New York State College of Forestry
has at last its 30,000 acre demonstration area
of Adirondack forest. The terms of sale arc
agreed on, and only a survey delays the for
mal turning over of the property. The tract
lies in Franklin .county, to the south of
Saranac lake, and partly upon the lower
slope of Mount Seward. It contains some
virgin forest, some from which lumbermen
have taken the choice timber, and some
from which forest fires have taken all the
timber. The college can, therefore, on the
start, demonstrate all sidts of forestry, from
planting bare tracts to lumbering and getting
the !ogs to market.
From the Periodical.
Horace Greeley—he used to tell the etory
himself—once sent a claim to a Western at-
I torney for collection, the attorney to keep
i half the amount for hi 3 fee. After a time
Mr. Grecley received the following note from
the lawyer:
"Dear Sir: I have succeeded in collectlug
my half of that claim. The balance is hope
less."—Albany Law Notes.

It Is well known that transportation com
panies, mere particularly than other employ
ers, desire to reduce to the low9st possible
minimum the use of intoxicating liquors by
their employes, says the Railway Conductor,
and it is only justice to the employes of
such companies to state that the desires
of the employers are warmly seconded by
the employes. The principal means adopted
to try to la-sen the use of liquors seem to
have been "discharge," and the next most
generally tried "a change of pay day from
Saturday to some other day." One firm
doing an extensive cda! handling business
in Chicago and in Milwaukee, and paying its
men by check on .Tuesdays, shows tha-t for
a period of two ninths' in Chicago, &i pet
cent of the checks, were cashed in saloons,
34 per cent in groceries, etc., and 2 per cent
In banks. In Milwaukee,.for the same period,
57 per cent were cashed in saloons, 43 per
cent in groceries, etc. In Milwaukee, 100 per

The mists of morn were rising fast
As through the city streets there passed
A youth, who bore a pile of books,

Luccheni, whose trial for the murder of tho
Empress of Austria recently began in Ge
neva, and who, by way of preparation, had
his photograph taken, has not a face which
fits the crime. Hl3 picture suggests a thief
in a fog perhaps, but nothing worse. But
that was to be expected. All accounts agree
that the assassin of Canovas had a retiring
manner. Very retiring, we should say.
Santo, Carnot's assassin, was regarded by his
acquaintances as engaging in the extreme.
Then there was Henry, the Parts bomb,
thrower, a man highly educated, intellectual
in conversation and aristocratic in appear
ance, who had but to smile to fascinate.
j Auguste Vaillant, too, who nearly blew up
I the French parliament, was described b>
those who knew him as apparently shy as a
girl, and of a sensibility which, seemingly,
however, did not extend to the chamber ot
deputies. So it is with this brute. He looks
like anything but a fiend. Yet, as already
noted, that was to be expected. Anarchists
spring from a class that has relapsed. They
are the savages of civilization. In their sav
agery is their cunning. It is their crimes
that startle, not their faces.—Collier's Week

EVIDENCE OF FAULTY BALLOT.
Agitation for a Ballot Reform Law
Gradually Beginning.
From the Duluth Herald.
The defeat of Justices Mitchell and Canty
for re-eleetioa to the supreme court by a
! purely partisan vote, cast with little regard
to the qualifications of the candidates for the
j important position, has renewed the dlacua
i sion whether some new method should be
adopted for selecting the supreme court
justices. The present plan is unsatisfactory.
This is admitted by nearly every person who
has given attention to the subject. The mem
bers of the bar, who are particularly inter
ested in seeing the appellate court composed
j of able juri3ts, unite In declaring that the
interests of Justice would be promoted by
choosing the Judges in some other way. The
people generally should be deeply interested
in seeing that the best men are given places
on the bench.
It is conceded, however, that the present
method of nominating candidates for the su
preme court is not conducive to this result,
and that too frequently political reasons are
sufficient to prevent the retention of the
I ablest members of the court. The cases of
I Judge Mitchell and Judge Canty illustrate
this fact. Their successors may prove able
judges, but tho fact remains that the retire
ment of the two Justices named is causing
great regret among the members of the bar
and others who appreciate their legal knowl
edge and ability.
But what changp shall be made? In what
way should the judges be chosen so as to
overcome the objections raised to the present
system of choosing them? Various methods
are suggested. It is possible that the best
method would be to have the judges of the
supreme court appointed by the gov
ernor, as the justices of the federal supreme
court are named by the president. But such
! a change would meet strong opposition. The
i people are slow to make elective offices ap
pointive.
A communication in another column offers
the suggestion that the justices of the su
preme court hold office for life, and that they
be appointed by the judges of the district
court, the latter being themselves ineligible to
the office. This might be a better plan than
leaving the selection to the governor, who
might be actuated by political reasons al
most exclusively when making such appoint
ments; but again, the objection will be raised
that it would deprive the people of a direct
voice in the selection of the court. However,
it is a subject that deserves consideration.
The district judges would be more likely to
consider legal attainments and judicial fitness
rather than political beliefs when making ap
pointments to the highest court in the state.
TO FIGHT ANARCHISTS.
Tlie Coiißrt'ss of Anti- Anarchist*
Km* in Rome Will Hold Three
We-eks* C'ounell of "War.
Among the conferences and commissions
now in session the most unique and yet the
least mentioned is the anti-anarchistic con
ference, which is being held in Rome. It |
owes us immediate origin to the assassin
who struck down the late empress ot Austria.
When the delegates of all the European na
tions had assembled In the Corsini palace,
Nov. 24. a formal organization was effected
with Admiral Canevaro, Italian minister of
foreign affairs, as president.
While the topics to be discussed are known,
any detailed information iii regard to the
proceedings is hard to get, owing to the
severe regulations maintained with reference
to admission to the palace. The building is
surrounded by soldiers and police, some in
uniform and some in citizen's dress. Officers
are stationed also in the inside of the palace,
and many are on the lookout for suspicious- |
j looking characters at the railway station.;, i
For £om« reason journalists are debarred !
from the conference, and for this reason the
details of the sessions are meager.
While the opinion prevails that the c^a
gress will not have any practical results,
President Canevaro, in welcoming the dele
gates for King Humbert, said that there
would certainly bo a most happy issue of '
the congress. The following propositions are
under discussion: 1. Anarchists are to be
regarded as common criminals, not as po
litical offenders. 2. The overt and public
acts of anarchists are to ba punished as
tr.nsgrocsions of the common law. 3. The
various nations interested shall at once enact
extiadition treaties. 4. All countries should
take some measures to suppress the anarchis
tic propaganda HI much as possible. 5. An
international pottee and detective service for
the suppression and prosecution of anarchists
shall be organized at ence.
Another interesting feature cf the confer
ence is the protest submitted to the confer
ence by Prince Krapotkin in behalf of the
•International id :al Anarchists." In this docu
| ment the nihilists maintain that, in spite
of the violence committed by Isolated in
dividuals, anarchism is a lcgiijma.e doctrine
—one which teaches perfect freedom, iiberty
untrammeled by licensed authority. The
protest closes with a warning to tho con
ference of the danger in attempting to sup
press the movement.
That the conference has heeded the warn
ing to some extent at least is shown by the
fact that 2.G00 su pected anarchists will be
kept under arrest during the congress, which
will not hold its final session until Christ
mas.
Horrors of Chicago \ewipaper
Reading.
Tho average Chicago youth of today enter
tains no real respect for the banker, mer
chant, ot capitalist, for he has bean taught
by the Chicago trust newspapers that the
banker, merchant or capitalist is no better
than ho should bs. Tha boy who reads the
trust newspapers has become confused in his
mind as to the relative value of the terms
applied to citizens in general. There is a
Jumble in his mind concerning the difference
between the capitalist, banker, merchant,
politician, and thief. H« cannot tell from
what he reads whether there Is in all Chi
cago any man or any class of men whose
character is worthy of emulation. He learns
that all men, and particularly all successful
men. are bad. He thinks after a time that
to be successful himself he must become as
tricky «b4 unscrupulous and dishoMit am
the leading men of the city are represented to
be, when it serves the purpose of the corrupt
newspapers thus to represent them.—Chicago

Dramatic and Musicat.
GRAND.
"At Piney Ridge," which has the boards
at the Grand this week, will doubtless prove
one of the best drawing card 3 of the season
at the popular playhouse. There was a
crowded house last night, and one that will
serve to exploit the excellence of the roman
tic Southern play, 'At Piney Ridge." The
plot is based upon love of a faithful woman
for an unscrupulous villain, and the trials
that beset the lives of all who fell beneath
the baleful Influence of hla machinations.
Blended with the tragedy that his perfidy
wrought is the love story of Jack Rose and
Azelie Deering. Love finally triumphs after
the most trying experiences, and the finale
Is as exciting as the many Incidents that load
up to it. The company Is exceptionally
strong. David Higgftis made a decided hit
as Jack Rose, while the 'Cindy Lane of Geor
gia Waldron was cleverly portrayed. Azeeil
Deering has much to do, and did it well,
Lydia Knott assuming the role. The Mark
BrJarson of Van Kinzle and the work of
Messrs. Tavernier, Hearn, Hedge and Gray,
as well aa that of Charlotte Wade, Marie
Kenzie, Edith Well, Francis May and, in
fact, the entire cast, was all that could be
desired. The attraction at the Grand for the
current week Is unquestionably one of the
beat that has visited St. Paul, and will grow
in favor with the patrons of tfh&t house.
METROPOLITAN.
"Moths," a dramatization of Ouida's novel,
was presented at the Metropolitan yesterday
afternoon and evening by the Woodward
Stock company In a most admirable manner.
The play is one that is well adapted to the
people of the Woodward company, and their
interpretation of the various characters could
hardly be improved on.
Like the preceding playa presented by the
Woodward people "Moths" is handsomely
staged and superbly costumed, and every
endeavor is made to make it realistic even
ln the most minute particulars.
The story is that of an English society
woman who a»pire3 to high position and who
sacrifices her daughter on the altar of ambi
tion by forcing her into marriage with a
Russian prince whom the daughter dislikes.
The Russian abuses his wife, accuses her of
unfaithfulness, forces her to receive a wom
an whom all the world looks on as her suc
cessful rival for the affections of the prince,
and finally, when the princess refuses longer
to receive her, exiles his wife. From her
home In the ice and snow of Poland she is
rescued by a faithful friend of her girlhood
days, who avenges her wrongs by killing the
prince In a duel, in which he himself 13
--ceives a mortal wound.
The role of Vera Herbert, who afterwards
becomes the Princess Zourvff, is a most dif
ficult one, but was admirably carried by
Beatrice Lieb. Carl Smith Leese was thor
oughly detestable as Prince Zouroff. He
made himself many enemies in the audience
through his splendid acting, while Wilson
Enos, as Lord Jura, who gave up his life
that the woman he loved might be rid of a
man she despised, won his way Into the J
hearts of his hearers. Mr. Enos had already 1
established himself as a favorite, and ln the
character of Lord Jura he cannot but win
new laurels. Louise Rlpley, as Lady Dolly
Vanderdesken, Princess Zouroff's mother, was
all that could be desired, and Cora Ernest
made a stunning Duchess de Sonnaz, Princess
Zouroff'a rival. Inez McCauley was a charm
ing Fuschia Leach, an American girl, and
made many new friends ln that character.
Frank Sheridan, as Raphael de Correze, and
Hal Davis, as the Duke of Mull, were good.
The vaudeville features In connection with
the giving of the drama are good. Horwitz
and Bowers are c:ever travesty artists and
are extremely funny. The only drawback to
an otherwise good turn Is a coarse song
that has no piaeo in the Metropolitan.
Petite Irene Franklin has been seen and
heard in St. Paul before. She had already
established herself as a favorite here, and her
welcome back was a hearty one. She sank a
number of songs in a clever manner, and
made a decided hit with her trademark,
'Keep Dem Golden Gates Wide Open."
The Vaidls sisters are aerial wonders.
They do some astonishing things on double,
single and revolving trapeze suspended above
the heads of the audience. Their act is a
meritorious one and well worth seeing.
Tha same bill will be presented through
the week, with the usual matinees.
AMERICAS SHIPBUILDING.
Conntry Ha** Fifteen ShtnbulldiiiK
Firm* of I iisuis>!)ns.m! Klliclctuy.
While Americans might have some diffi
culty in securing suitable steamers to be used
on the various lines to our colonial posses
sions which will shortly bp established as
soon as operations begin, yet when It comos
to building a fleet of vessels, the orders will !
be given in this country, amd we will qua:- I
antee that they will bs? turntd out as expedi
tiously as they wish them to be, or as an.
other country could produce them. For wi?
have here in the United States today at least
fifteen firms that can turn out ocean steam
ers of the finest class, and at as rapid a
rate as any shipbuilding concern in the
world. Half a dozen of thesp firms could
take an order tomorrow for steamships of tho
size and power of the Sc. Paul, Campania, }
or Kaiser Wilholm der Grossp, and set them '
afloat In the shortest possible tim?, and as
for building vessels equal to or better than i
the steamships of Mr. Williams' Atlantic j
transport line, there are any number of firms ;
in this country who could pruduce them with
little trouble.
Today, as our leading shipbuilding plants
stand, they have a capacity of a yearly out
put of 3(10,000 tons of steel ships, and their
proprietors stand reudy to execute all orders
as they may come to them, and could, in very
short order, enlarge their plants to any size
to accommodate all demands for new Amer
ican steamers. Freight steamers carry the
world's goods, and in this particular Great
Britain stands pre-eminent in its multitudi
nous fleet. We could name twenty-five Amor
lean shipyards that could today, were tha
orders placed with them, build freight st a fri
ers of the suanchest and most economical
type.
Witness the fact that in a. few months' tima ;
the Bath iron works, that extensive ship
building enterprise up in the state of Mai"o, !
turned out a magnificent freighter of the i
much maligned but money-making "trsimp'' j
class, tho Winifred, and in the space of four !
or five rconchs the William Cramp & Sons' j
Ship and Ei.gine Bulldh.g company, as an •
aside to their regular work of building war i
vessels, have built entirj and placed in
commission four elegant coastwise freight and '■
passenger steamers, nam-d after our admirals,
and two ocean steamers of the first class! j
the Mexico and. Havana, are approaching 1
completion. At Roich's shipyard a steamship I
of the oil-carrying type, as strong as any !
afloat, was launched ilhe other day, whilo -.t !
Harlan & Hollhvgsworth's plant in Wilming- j
ton no less than four steamships are under
way, one of which is the second American
'tramp," which has been constructed in an
incredibly short space of time. The New
port News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock com
pany have their yard filled with tho hulls of
new steamships which are to be used in
the American trade. Such firms as these as
well as the Maryland Steel company, the !
Columbian Iron works, the Pusey & Jones I
company. John H. Dialogue, the Neafle & j
Levy Shij> and Engine Building company, I
Lewis Nixon, the Charles liillman Ship and i
Ergine Building company, T. S. Marvel &
Co., the Atlantic works, the Union Iron works
and many other coastwise shipyards ace ca- I,
pable of building the future merchant aiai'.ne
of the United States.

DRY GOODS.
The settling down of cold, H «wouabL
I layer of snow has given a stimulus to the
j dry goods trade. Demands for heavier winter
wear, which were reported as somewhat tardy
week before last, were much more freely re
ceived during the past few days. Collection,
are reported as more generally improved die
fact being attributed to increasing sett ements
by farmers with the country merchants out
of funds received from the marketing of
, wheat. The advance orders fur the spring
: trade are also increasing in numbers and are
more and more gratifying In point of supply
• * «
GROCERIES.
There has been considerable improvement in
orders in grocery lines. The prevalence of
j the recent snow storm had, for a time the
effect of disturbing the current of trade In
this branch. Now, however, the laying m of
supplies for the holiday period has caused
marked activity. Prices are firm and ara
likely to continue so for several weeks. The
trade Is even greater than was expected. Col
lections are quite satisfactory.
• • •
BOOTS AND SHOES.
Trade hi this line has been much imDroved
by the advent of winter and snow. One of the
largest and oldest manufacturing houses in
this center of the Northwest retorts the
largest trade ln Its history for November, and
with work going on overtime in the factory.
Collections are much improved ever a month
ago.
• • •
HATS, FURS. GLOVES, ETC.
While orders ln these lines are usually
placed ln anticipation of tha opening of tha
season, there is always a reserve pending
the advent of cold weather. The sudden ar
rival of suow in such volume as to suggest
a long, If not a severe winter, has had the
effect of bringing out many of these reserve
orders and creating greater activity than has
I prevailed during the past few weeks of walt
j ing to see what the winter was going to he
like. There is an improvement, also, in the
grades called for. There exists still some
sluggishness in the matter of collections, but
this is not unusual, as the stocks are gener
ally not disposed of until they are needed by
consumers.
• • •
DRUGS, PAINTS, OILS, ETC.
The past week in the drug business ha 3
been marked by unusual activity. Ontora
have been many, and for good quantities.
Collections excellent and trade limits are
constantly increasing. St. Paul leads more
than ever In this line of business, as als-o in
others. The advances ln price have been few
and unimportant. The decline in glycerine
of Vie per Ib is among the few changes. As
usual at this season, some contracts on
paints, oila. etc, are being made for the fu
ture. The fine cigar business, as connected
with the drug trade, la active and sal;»s large
and satisfactory.

CROCKERY, LAMPS, GLASSWARE. ETC.
There is unusual activity Just now in the

A better business generally is reported for
this year than last, or several years previous.
Collections are all that can be desired

There is little change in the lines of this

- The Tliuch Wu a Homloo.
No wonder The Globe is Inclined to jeer
at the Minneapolis Times, and taunt it with
the variation of 65,000 between Auditor
Dunn's majority of 44,000 and Mr. Eustls'
minus of 21,000. Throughout the campaign
Mr. Eustls' friends constantly deplored tha
support of ttw Times; and Mr. Dunn's friends
as constantly and much more vociferously
boasted of the Times' hostility to 'Bob," and.
Just as they predicted, it was shown that tho
Times' support was a hoodoo and its oppo
sition a mascot.—St. Paul Dispatch.
Tin-Plate Fact*.
The Iron Trade Review «ays that "the tin
plate consolidation (trust) is now an assured
fact." Here are some other assured facts:
That the Dlngjley tariff protects this trust
with a duty of one and one-half cents a
pound; that the supreme court has sustained
the anti-trust law, declaring such combina
tions illegal; that the Republican attorney
general will do nothing to enforce the law
or to Insure respect for the decision.—New

Fok Signals ln London.
In meeting the necessities created by the
dense and continuous fogs of London the
various companies engaged in furnishing the
small but important fog signals are an
active feature. In exigent weather conrli
tiono, even the smaller ot the \arlou3 com
panies running through the great city R
suburbs have sometimes to issue a hundred
gross a day of these signals, while larger
ones will use double that number. This de
vice is extremely simple, consisting of a
rinch of gunpowder and three percussion
caps Inclosed in three small metal cases one
within the other, and each closed up 'with
white lead, while in the Innermost case are
three nipples, on which the percussion caps
are fitted, the powder being placed around
them. The complete thing Is about the size
•"■fa large watch, and has appended to it two
.Tips of lead which are simply bent round
the flange of the rail, thus holding the foe
signal in cositton on the top. As these little
machines arc substitutes for semaphores and
lamps, it is, of course, a matter of utmost
importance that they shall not fail. It is for
this reason that there are three percussion
cays and three cases, one inside the other co
as to exclude wet.—New York Sun.
Ancient Weather Vnue.
The ancient weather vane of Faneull hall,
Boston—a mammoth grasshopper—is to be
