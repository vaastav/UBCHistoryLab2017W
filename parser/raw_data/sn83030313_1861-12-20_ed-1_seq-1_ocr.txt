Tbo mail bag containing tbo despatches from Minister
Adams wan placed in charge of Captain Ge orge Cook, i f
-*< . t- ?-v ?*
the Twenty-second Massachusetts Volunteers, al Boston,
with a view of expediting its transmission to Washing
ton. Captain Cook travelled with the Queen's messenger,
Captain Seymour, liy the Shore Line route from Boston to
- .1
Wow York, where Ihey arrived more than two hours bo
hind time, and missod the connection. The English
bearer of despatches proceeded hy special train.
CfcptAin Cook telegraphed Secretary Seward to know if
be should engage a special train, and received answer that
It was not necessary. lie arrived with his charge this
morning, only a few hours behind rapt. Seymour. Tho
despatches were calmly received by the Secretary, They
filled a large mail bag, and weighed one hundred pounds.
At New Haven there was great excitement at the dopcl
when tbo train arrived. There ivns an immense crowd,
?orlous to cc? the Queen's messenger, who was then fast
?Bleep.
An absurd rumor was circulated to day, that the gov
ernment decided last evening to surrender Mason sod
Sideil. It Is without any foundation whatevor.
Op to eleven o'clock to night I/ird Lyons had made no
communication from his government to tho President or
Secretary of State relative to the seizure of the traitors
Wason and Slidell. Mr. Adams, ,n his communications
to Mr. Seward, gives a clear and detailed idea of the feel
tog of the British people and the sentiment of British
?talesmen, but does not iudloate that he knows the pur
port or tho Instructions of the English government to
Lord Lyons.
JVotTuup contained fn Mr. Adanu' ilripatfhen indicate*
thai that government wiU make any recrbiteuU demand u/xin
the United Statei relative, to the tenure of the traitort. This
Is not only true, but ] am pormilled to announce, by high.
official authority, thai private letters received to-day
firom distinguished British statesmen, assert that the
government of Croat Britain will not demand the releaso
of Mason and Slldell, but will require an apology and such
reparation as the United States can honorably grant
This is also contirmod by other private correspondence
from Americpns in London, who have facilities for IcArn
tag something of the intentions of tbo British govern
ment.
Hie French Minister gave a dinner this evening. l'he
British, Rptinifli. Kuseian nnd other Ministers were pre
pent In conversation the utiles were rather turned
upon Die French Minister, that he hud received no in
structions from his government on the Mason and Slidell
wghlr, since France was viewed as the chosen ally of
M?(land. This was pleasantly done, but the French
Minister did not relish the joke.
The President has important private letters that will
Bavo great weight in the summing up of this traitorou8
Imbroglio.
Senator Humucr, Chairmiiuof the CommiUeo on Finance)
Interrupted the proceedings of the Sonata to-dao, by mov.
tng that tho body go into Executive Sews ion to consider
important business oommunk-utod by special message
from the President. Tho motion carried.
The inesssge covered highly important documents con
corning our foreign relations, but having no reference to
the Mason and Slidell affair. It concerns the tri-portito
expedition to tho Gulf, which is. after a.'), of more im
portance to this government than everything else now
agitating the public mind in this country. The messago
was ordorcd to printed.
The Maeou and Slidell affair is only employed by the
British government as a pretext while they -employ their
forces in another direction to destroy our power and
utrengthen their own.
fHB CABE OF TH? BRITISH SUIT rKRTHMb IRK?TBI
DAMAGE TO I1EH OWNERS MADB GOOD.
The Oommittec on Foreign R' lailonr, to wboua was re
ferred so much of tho President's Message as folates to
any claim of the British government on account of the
detention of the ship Perthshire, have had the aeme un
der eoniideration,and now report
The President, ttUtlu annual Message, luviteil the at
tention of Congress to the correspondence between her
Britannic Majesty's Minister accredited to this govern,
saent and tho Secretary of Slate, relative u> the dot en
lion of the British shif Perthshire, it./line lsst, by the
United State* steamer Massachusetts, for a suppoa-d
toreaeh of tbs klockadc In the opinion of the President
*ble detention was oceasinr< d by an uc-vious misappr*
tension of the facts, and as justice reguireu it hat we
(taould commit nc helUgcr-ut act not founded it strict
right. as saoctlonec by public law, he recommended that
an appropris'ion be made to satisfy the reasonable de
aaandof the owner of tho vessel for her detention.
It appears from the correspondence that the British
?hip Parthshire, belonging to Wis Gray, was chartered
By a merchant in Liverpool, in March last, to proeeed in
Ballast from Grimsby to PensaacJa. and there load a
cargo of timber for the Unltevi Kingdom, the Charterer,
however, having his option, fBroutfi his agent at Pen
sacola, of ordering the chip to Mobile to load cost on to
Liverpool. The Perthshire tailed from Grimsby in March
last, and on the 13th or May was mtklng^or the harbor
of Peaaaoola, when she was boarded by oa officer of the
Catted States ship Sabine, and her captain was warned
that Pensacola was blockaded, but informed that Mobile
Vas not blockaded. The ship then proceeded to Mobile,
where the arrived on the lfth of May, twelve days
before that pprt wae blookaded, and loadbd a cargo of
cotton for Liverpool
The blockade w>? esiabllrhad cn the *01 h of Mty or
the 30th the ship left tbo Lerbor of Mobile, and wa
boarded by an officer of the United States stearnor Nia
gara, who parsed bor, by order of his superior officer,
Captain W. W. McKean, United States Navy, as tho tlftoeu
days allowed by the President of the United States for
neutral vessels to depart had not expired.
The ship proceeded on her voyage until the 9th of June,
when sbe was boarded and seized as a prize by order of
(Vunmaudor M. Smith, of the United States steamer Massa
chusetts, a prize crow was placed on board, and she was
taken back to the blockading squadron. Oapluln MoKoati,
tho officer commanding the squadron,stated to Command
or Smith thut the Perthshire bad left Mobilo within tho
tine allowed by the President's proclamation, and that
ho considered tho capture illegal, i s by order of tho Navy
I'epurtmeut no noutral vessel, not having on board con
traband of war, was to be detained or captured unless
attempting to leave or enter a blockaded port after the
notification of bb ckado bad been endorsed on her re
gister.
Captain Adams, of the Sabine stated that at the time
the Perthshire was boarded from bis ship, and ordered
ofT from I'sr.sucola. there was no blockade of Mobile
Captain McKean accordingly directed Commander Smith
to release the Perthshire, and to replace such provisions
and stores as might have been usod by the prize crew,
which was done.
On the arrival of the Pe'th-hire at Liverpool, Mr. Cray,
her owner, addressed a memorial to Karl Russell, tier
Britannic Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Atf.drsi
requesting his lordship, through the British Minister at
Washington, to In mg the cuse before the government of
the United .State- and U< present a claim for two hundred
pounds sterling, beii'd twelve days freight at the rato at
which she was chartered. The claim was accordingly
presented by Lord Lyons to the Secretary of State of the
United Slap s, who referred the subject to llui Secretary
cf tho Navy for Information. On the receipt of a report
of the fio-is in the case, Mr. Seward addressed tho follow,
tug lottcr to laird Lyons:?

FIRING or A REBEI. BATTERY ON THE POTOMAC.
A new rebel battery on the Potomac, opposite Run
Point, consisting of three guns, one of which is a sixty
four pounder, opened lire last night. One of the shells
carried away the cornor of Clemens' House, and two fell
into the camp of a New Jersey reglmont on the Maryland,
neither of them exploding. Tho lust shot was fired about
twelve o'clock last night.
AFFAIRS ON THE LOWER POTOMAC?SHARP FIRING
FROM THE REBEL BA rTBRIJtla?NARROW ESCAPE OF
THE RELIANCE.
The Potomac correspondent of tho Uihjii u makes the
following report:?
UsmtDStatw Siramnk Yankks, off Matwoiian ( Tuuk , j
Potomac Kivfh. Pee. IS?7 I'. M.
At sundown this evening the United States eleamer
Reliance, Acting Maetor Harrison, left her moorings In
this neighborhood, in order to pass tbe rebel ballet ice,
With the view of communicating with the lower flotilla.
Shortly after she left the moon rose, throwing a faint
light over the river. The rebel batteries at (Jpofsum's
Nose have just ojiened fire. Three bright Hashes of flame
arc seen, succeeded by ss many loud reports from heavy
guns. A short pause follows, urul thin tboio arc four
mere finches and as many reports. The Reliance must
show a clean pair of heels, or she Is liablo to
be crippled, if not sunk; but Captain Harrison has I
taken the precaution to biveasmuch steam up ss his |
engineers can product, and the rebels must tire briskly !
to keep pace with her. They seem to understand it, for
now the lightning-like flashes and the mimic thunder of
lhe guns are quick und incessant. Shells are describing
what Mrs. I'urtingion would correctly enough call tho
??diabolic curve'' through the air, bursting over the
Maryland shore, aud exhibiting a momentary gleami
followed in a fow seconds by a sharp report, indicating
that tboy havo exploded. None are seen to explode ivr
the river, and there ere consequonlly hopes that the
Reliance has run the gauutlol unharmed, though it :8
poSHible thai she may have been struck by solid shot or
un)<>ad?<i shell. Still the Reliance continues hor
onward course, under a full head of steam, and
still the batteriescontinue to pour out streams of fire
from their guns. Battery after battery opens. Shipping
Point is reached, and the iron messengers of dsat.b con
tinue to be sent after the little vessel. The roar of the
cannon is nearly continuous, intermingled with the thrill
whistle of the shells as they cut through tlio evening sir
Though Che Yankee is six or seven miles from the battery
that first ojiened, the concussion of the atmosphereca>it?s
a perceptible tremor on board this vessel. The batteries
at Chapawainsic creek, the lowest along the line, now
opeu. Several more rounds are fired, ami at hnlf past
seven O'clock the firing ceases, after twenty
seven shells have been thrown. One of the
engineers has just descended to the wardroom
and intimated that the Reliance has blown her
whistle twice. This proves that she has not hsen sunk,
and to judge by previous efforts on the pert of the rabcls
it is improbable that she is seriously injured. She has
not Mlnrned the fire, as that would only tend to still more
plainly expose her position.
Two more guns are hoard (about eight o'clock)?this time
from the Maryland shoro. A few minutes elapse and tho
compliment Is returned by two mors guns from Shipping
Tolnt batteries.
This afternoon tbe new batury at Cockpit Point fired
two shots from a heavy gun.it was supposed at a brig
that lay ?t the entrance to <Mata woman creek, a
little above Stamp Neck. Captain Eastman sent the
Murray down to tow the brig further up
out of tango, which was done, the battery at
Cockpit Point did not open on the Reliance.
TT? TRIAL OF COLON P.J KERRIGAN.
The trial of Col. Kerrigan was resumed to day Clapt.
Ferguson, of Company H, twenty-fifth regiment, testified
that he bad seen the accused leave the camp at various
timet since it was in Virginia and that he was not geoer
allv in full uniform. Ha heard theCoienel any that helwl
received a letter from I.leuienant Fay,cf his rsgtmeat,
wb<> had been taken prisoner. The fototnel said Fay was
bard up and wanted fifteen dollars. Witwsea asked tbe
Colonel if bo wanted the officers to make up the amount,
awl he replied that he would attend le It; that Fay had
be?o an officer tu tho regimeul, aud ahould not want for
money. The accused did not tell witness bow he received
tbe loiter from Fay (it will be proved that this letter was
taken to the camp in the mail bog). On one occasion
witness rode out wltu some German riflemen three m,le3"
beyond our lines, and after returning staled in
conversation with the Colonel bin belief that
be bad bees further into tho ensmy's country than any
other officers la tbe regiment. He described some land
marks on the route, and the Colonel aaul he had been
still farther. Witness said that In this conversation both |
of thsm were, perhaps, speaking in bravado FNrldenre I
wns alto put in to show that on one occasion a captain
a picket p??l arretted a toltgale keeper and sent him to
camp. On the way (xilonal Kerrigan and some offl. era
met if party aDtl rei<v.?ed tin Tho fell man returned !

Colonel Wm Ilatsted, of tho Now Jersey cavalry, was
tried to-day by court martial. The tuemflh.ee of the
chaig t was that be drew commutation for frr.qp lor flvo

KKFORta OF TUB CONDITION OP AFKA.I1U3 Til If HP.
Capt. -las. B. Ri<-kctts, with his heroic and dcvobul
wife, arrived in this city to-day and are staying w ith
their rclHtivo, A. J. Palmer, of the corps of Topographical
Kngineers, I'nited States Artny. Capt. RickottS, at tlie
b"?d of his battery, at Hull run, rccoived a serious wound
in bin left leg, from which ho has not recovered, llis
good constitution and temperate habits, and the At
tendance of his wife, have enabled him to endure
the pain and withstand the effects of any In
jury by which tho principal bono of the limb was
shattered. While confined as a prisoner of war in Rh b
rnond Hospital Captain Ricketts is exchanged for Captain
Julius D. I ague I, who was taken prisoner at Rich Moun
tain. nud arrived yesterday at Fortress Monroe. His
exchange was effected with difficulty, as the rebels justly
deemed him an accomplished artillerist. Capia n
Rickntls graduated at Wast Foinl In 1829, and has been
nearly twenty years in tha service. Ho now returns to
Washington, after having made a gallant fight, his bat
tery having hoen ratakeD three times. Still a captain,
while some of bis Juniors by some ten years are brigadier
generals.
Yoi^ correspondent held en Interview this evening
with Captain Rickett* and his lady, but they seemed in
clined to withhold information respecting affairs in Vir
ginia, probably from a fear that any revelations they
might make would prove injurious to prisoners left behind
them. From other sources, however, we learn various
interest, ng facts. The altairs of the confedo
ates are not rose colored Just now. The
blockade of their ports has produced the se
verest effects. Many etaple articles of living are
is. arte that tbey oomruand ruinous pricss. Salt is ex
tremely doar; tea costs tour dollars per pound, bnttor
seventy-five cents, cotton thread is twenty dive cents a
spool, and sewing silk cannot be had. 80 pressing are the
wants of the people in Virginia for articles of prims
necessity that the news from England respecting the cap
ture of Mason and Siidell waa received with spasmodic
joys. The rebels began to prediot immediately after the
exploit of Commander Wilkes that it would produce a
rupture with England to the benefit of Shoir cause, and
tboy now feel confident of such a result.
| Their indignation at the capture or their Ministers was
much softened by the prospective gcod that would Sow
from it through the hostility of England.
The promptitude which Jeff. Davis is furnished with
information from the ,Vorth is surprising. On Sunday
night he was awakened by a messenger, who Informed
him of (lie news received by the Europe and Capt. Soy
mmir's arrival. The messenger almost forced bis way into
Davis' residence to oenvey to him the welcome intelli
gence lie - receives a copy of the New York Hsralq
every day, and it is said that be and his Cabiuee were
much annoyed by the correct report of the stats of the
Richmond defences,which Utrly appeared in the Hiralp.
Tbo accuracy of the statements was acknowledged.
The rebels are concentrating a large fore# at Coosa
baichle creak, in South Carolina, (general Pemberton is
command, ~kj>d Generals Evnns asd Grs^g are also
there. The Eleventh Alabama regiment was lately sent
there from Ontervlllo on account of tho sickness among
ottico/s and men. Nine thousand of their men are lying
sick in the public hospitals of Richmond, besides large
numbers in private boepitala and private houses.
The earthworks at Richmond are still without cannon
Ben McCiilloch is there to guttle the difliculty occasioned
by the appointment of General Heath to supercede Gene
ral l'rice in Missouri. The appointment was actually
made by Pavis, hut he was compelled to retract It.
Tho other relumed prisoners are Rev. Mr. Mies, of
Grace church. Rath, Me., Chaplain of the Second Maine
regiment and two hoys, named Thomas Wilkinson and
(ha les Smith, eons of ofllcers in GeutralSicmos' brigade.
Chaplain Mines expresses his acknowledgments for kind
treatmont from General Winder, tho commandant at
Richmond, and Captain Gibbs. commandant of tho
POrt. Ho represents the prisoners ?s much In coed
of clothing. The Massachusetts men had received a
supply from the State gororamou'., tut none had ro.iohed
tho otliors from the United stales government. Since
cold weather set in three or four deaths per day roeult
from the tmuBelency of cluthiug. For a large portion
of the time Mr. Mines was uol allowed to visit the sick
and dying, or to preach to the privates. 1-attorIy tho
privilege of the prison wns allowed him.

1 he House resumed the consideration of the bill pro.
Tiding for construe! ing twenty iron-clad steam gunboats,
to be built by eonlract or otherwise, a . iho Secretary of
the Nnvy may deem best, for the public Interest.
Mr. VaiLA.snsiHAM, (opp.) of Ohio, ollerod and ndvo
rated an smendmfnt providing that Iho new gunboats
shall In constructed at. the public navy yards as far us
practicable, or by private contract, after gi. ing ten days
uoticc for proposals, published in Iho papers of New York,
lloston, Philadelphia and Baltimore.
Mr. Skiwiwhk (rep.) of N. Y., In explanation, said
that these vessels are to be built on a plun entirely differ,
ent from those already constructed. Tho details and
specifications he would deem it imprudent to disclose,
even if lis had the means. Tho plan was well considered
by a committee of naval olllcei s.
Mr. Valla mmcham incidentally said, iu the course of
hiB remarks, that, rather than yield the principles which
we huve held for years, ha was prepared to meet the com
bined hostility of the whole world, and this he believed
was ilie sentiment of the entire American people.
Mr. SxixiwiCK said that the Pcnearola was one of the
beauties of building by private oontract, w hich was less
satisfactory and economical than these constructed ut the
government yards. He ^Sedgwick) did not believe that
a foreign war was landing; but If it was so, he hoped that
thequeslion would be met iu a proper spirit. There was no
insult of which Great Rritatn could complain to justify
w?r. The vessels now proposed to be constructed were
not for service abroad, but at home, to put down the
rebellion.
Mr. Vallandigbam's amendment was disagreed to, and
the hill passed.

Following tlie railroad track, the next point*
of importance are KlizahelMown and Nolln, both
places often mentioned in the present struggle. A short
distance further on is Upton station, doubtless named
after I he noted secessionist, Mrs. Upton, who has caused
some little trouble already to the government. The next
