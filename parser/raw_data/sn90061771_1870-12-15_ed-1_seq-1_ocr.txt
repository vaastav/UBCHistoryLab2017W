PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
THINGS GENERALLY.
A vaar ofocaoe andntcnoral prosperity
(o this nation has passed sinco tho last
assembling of Congress. Wo bavo,
through a kind Providence, been blessed
with, abundant crops nnd have been
pared, from complications and war with
foreign nations. In our midst compara
tive harmony has been restored. It is to
be regretted, however, that a freo exor
cise of the eleotive franchise has by vio
lenco and intimidation been denied to
citizons in exceptional cases in several of
the States lately in robcllion, and that the
verdict of the people has thereby been
reversed.
RECONSTRUCTION IN PARTICULAR.
Tho Statos of Virginia, Mississippi and
Texas bavo been restored to representa
tion in our nationat councils. Georgia,
the onlv Stato now without representa
tion, may confidently be expeeted to take
her place there also, at tho beginning of
tho new year, and then let us nopo, win
be completed the work of reconstruction.
With an ncquiesccnco on tho part of tho
whole peoplo in tho national obligation
to nay tho public debt created as tho
price of our union, tho pensions to our
disabled soldiers anu auur, uu muu
wi lows and orphans, and in tho changes
in tho constitution, which have been
violation of the provisions of tho treaty
of 1705 bolweon the United States' and
Spain. Hepreajajtation or injuries re
sulting to sevoral persons claiming to be
citizens of the United States, by reason
of such violation, wore made to tne
Spanish government from April 1809 to

Juno last, rne opnuisn minister v
Wanhinuton had bean clothed witb a
limited power to aid in redressing such
wrnn. That oower was found to bo
withdrawn in view, as it was saiu 01 me
favorablo situation in which the island
of Cuba then was, which howover, did
not lead to the revocation of the suspen
sion of the extraordinary nnd arbitrary
functions exercised by the cxocuiivo
power in Cuba, and wo were obliged to
make our complaint at Madrid.
In the negotiations thus opened, and
atill nendinir. the United States only
claimed that for tho futuie tho rights
secured to their citizens by tbo treaty
should bo respected in Cuba nnd that,
as to the past, a joint tribunal should bo
mtahlished in tho United States, with tall
jurisdiction overall such claims. Beforo
such an impartial tribunal eaoh olaimant
would bo required to prove nis case, vn
the othe'r hand Spain would be at liberty
to traverse overy" material fact, and thus

Hi OEoaBAPIIlCAL ADVANTAGE.
Tho aenuisition of San Douii'nco is
deeirablo, because of its geographical
Dosition. It commands mo cntranco 10

of cotnraerco. It possesses tho richest

OTHER ADVANTAGES.
In case of foreign war it will givo us

Atlantic and those bordering on tho gulf
of Moxico by way of the Bahamas and the
Antilles. Twice wo must, as it were,
piss through foreign countries to got
from Georgia to the east coast" of Florida.
San Domingo, with a staple govern
ment, under which her immense resources
can bo developed, will give remunerative
wages to ten thousand laborers not now
upon the bland. This labor will take
advantage of every ataiable means of
transportation to abandon tho Adjacent
islands and seek the blessings of its free
dom and its sequenco each inhabitant
to receive tho reward ol his own labor.
Porto Uioo and Cuba will have to abolish
slavery as a measure of self preservation
to retain tbeir laborers.
COMMERCIAL ADVANTAGES.
San Dominco will become a large con
sumer of the products of Northern farms
nnd manufactories. The cheap rato at
which provisions can be furnished, with
fund, tools, and imnroved machinery, will
mi.Ua it neccssarv that contiguous islands
should have the same advantages, in order
to competo with it in tho production ol

our products. The production 01 our

CLAIMS AGAINST VENWUKLA.
The Booses of Congress is desired as

ceedings of tho commission on claims
aualnst Venezuela, as commumcaicu in
tho messages ot i'iurcn 4, isoir, .narcn 1,
1870 and March 31, 1870. It has not
been deemed advisable to distribute any
of the money which has been received
from that government until Congress
shall have acted upon the subject.
THE TIEN TslN MAS9ACRU.
The massacro of the French and Rus
sian resideuts at Tien Tsin, under circum
stances of great barbarity, were suppo.'ed
by some to have been premeditated and
to indicate a nurpoae aiuoni; tbo populace
to exterminate foreigners in the Chincpe
empire. The evidence fails to establish
miL-li a sutmosition. but shows n complic
ity of tho local authorities with tho mob.
Tho government at Pckin, however, seems
to have been disposed to fulfil its treaty
obligations. 80 far as it washable to do so.

THE SLAVE TRADE.
Sinco the adjournment of Congress, the
ratification of tho treaty with Great Brit
ain fur the abolition of tho mixed courts
for the suppression of tbe slave trade, has
been recognized. It is believed that tbe

taken to Aiabiau markets.

TIIE CUBAN SITUATION.
It ia not understood that the condition
-of the ir.surrection in Cuba has materi
ally changed since tho close of the last
session of Congress. At an early stage of
'tbo' contest tbe authorities of spam inau
rated a systora of arbitrary atresia ; of
uloso confinement ; of military trial and
execution of persons sospectcd of eom-
'pliojty with the insurgonts ; a summary
embargo of their property and requisi
tions upon their revenues by executive
warrant. Such proceedings, ai far as
they affected tbe persona or property of
-oitircu ar too unuea otatei, were in
nn nf tho Senate. I thoroughly con
tinoed them that the best interests ot tno
country, commercially and materially,
demanded its ratification. Time has only
oonflrmod mo in this view. I now nrmiy
beliovc that the moment it is known mat
ihn United States has entirely abandoned
the project of accepting as a part of its
territory the laiana 01 Dan uummnu,
freo port will bo negotiated for by Euro

assume among nations.
In view of tho importance of this
question, Icarnostly urge upon Congress
early action expressive of its views as to
tno best means 01 acquiriuj; ouu uuuiuk
Mi suffnestion is that, by a joint resolu
tion of tho two houses of Conuross the
executive be authorized to appoint a com
missioner to negotiate tor a ireaiy whu
tho authorities of San Domingo for tbe
acquisition of that island, and that an ap
propriation be made to defray the expenses
of such commission. Tbe question may
then be determined by tho aotion of the
two houses of Coogreas upon a resolution
at annexation, aain the oaao of the annex
ation of Texas. So convinced am I of
all the advantacea to flow from the acqui
nition of San Domingo, and of tho great
disadvantages I might say calamities
to flow from non-acquisition, mat j
believe the subject has only to bo inves
tigated to be approved.

convictions are directly tbe reverse, and
I therefore recommend to Congress to

ownership of tbeir claims, on notice to

Wasbington, and mat aumority oe given
for tho commencement of these claims by

shall have tbe ownership of tho private
claims aa well as the responsible control
of all the claims against Great Britain.
It oannot be nocestary to add that
whenever her maiestv's government shall
entertain a desire for a full and friendly
adjustment of there claims, the United
States will enter upon their consideration
with an oaruest desire for a conclusion
consistent with the honor and dignity of
both nations.

Anticipating that an attempt may pos

recommend you to confer upon the Exec

A like unfriendly disposition has been
manifested on tho port of Canada in tho
