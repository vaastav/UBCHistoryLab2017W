Four-Power Treaty

B% G. gAILD UXtOLK.
The lost jam of tlie Washington
conference was broken yesterday
when the four-power treaty on the
Pacific islands was assented to for
mally by the delegates of the United
Spates. Great Britain, France and -Ja
t^n.
Other issues, before the conference
.-?? expected now to move forward
\ .tii great rapidity.
I'.ut ifAhe Washington conference
. i.ulil bring forth nothing beyon*
she new four-power treaty it will
l.tve justified itself. was the view
taken here last night. The new pact
brings assurance of peace in the^ ar
,.,0!?it goes far toward the elimina
tion of the t?*nsion which has waxed
and waned and waxed again. It pro
x ides for the termination of the
Anglo-Japanese treaty of alliance,
which, rightly or wrongly, was looked
upon with suspicion in this country.
Event! to Move Rapidly*
The forthcoming week probably
will see the settlement of the naval
ratio question as between the United
States. Great Britain rind Japan. anJ
probably also the naval ratio of France
and Italy.
The proposed ten-year naval holi
day and the question of submarines
also will be quickly settled, it was
declared oh high authority last night.
There remain the Chinese problems,
which have advanced measurably al
ready. The progress of the discus
sions with relation to China has been
very satisfactory.
So far as the four-power treaty is
concerned?the treaty of Washing
ton, as it probably will be recorded
in history?it was learned on the
highest authority last night that U
will be formally signed by the pleni
potentiaries of the nationa Involved
immediately. It will- then be for,
President Harding to deteEfllmtf"4rHin
it shatl be transmitted to the Senate
for ratification.
Mnat Go (? Cafelaeta.
The treaty must go to the British
cabinet, to the cabinet of Japan and
to the French senate and chamber of
deputies for approval alsp before the
final ratification can be exchanged.
The view last night was unanimous
that ratification would be completed.
Senator Lodge in presenting the
treaty yesterday said that the rati
I,cation by the United States was de
pendent upon the successful negotia
tion of an agreement between the
United States and Japan regarding
ihe mandated Island of Tap. At the
State Department it was said yester
day afternoon that an agreement on
Yap was now merely a "matter of
hours."
The Senate of the United States
will ratify the new treaty when it is
submitted It. This was confidently
predicted last night
The great majority of expressions
of opinion voiced by senators yes
terday after reading the treaty was
highly favorable. j
Meaate Fight Organlalag. j
A fight against ratification is or- j
ganixing. however, among some of
the old "irreconcilables" of the*Sen
ate- But the Indications are they will
not obtain sufficient votes to prevent
favorable action. The democrats,
who with few exceptions voted for
the league of nations,'4can scarcely
bo expected to oppose the present
treaty on the ground that it would
accomplish the same end as that of
the league, which so far has been the
only argument advanced against the
new treaty by the irreconcilables.
The tremendous sentiment in the
country in favor of bringing forth
from the Washington conference ac
tual accomplishments looking to
peace, and particularly peace in the
far east, is expected to have its in- j
fluence on the Senate.
Any effort to make it appear that j
the new treaty in its article II ap-:
pruaches article X of the league of
nations covenant will fall flat.
"I have deep sympathy for any one i
whose opinion is that there is any1
blood relation between article II of
this treaty and the league of nations
covenant," said the spokesman of the
American delegation yesterday after
noon.
Haifa oa W?H "Preserve."
lie explained that the article X of
I he Vague of nations, which caused
the failure of the treaty of Versailles
and the league covenant ip. the Sen
ate provided that tl^a contracting
parties should "reatfect" and also
"preserve"' (meanlftg with force) the
territories an*'rights of the nations
party to the pact. The kernel in that
nut. h? pointed out, was the '"pre
serve."
In the new treaty there Is nothing
that calls for the preservation of any
right or territory by use of force. It
rails for consultation and for the
giving of friendly advice. There is
no obligation imposed upon the con
tracting parties to carry out any de
cision arrived at in auch conference,
and it will be a matter for the na
tion* involved to determine through
their regular constitutional proc

JAPANESE SEE NEW ERA
IN RELATIONS WITH U. S.
AS RESULT OF TREATY
B.v the Associated Press.
The linking: of the Japanese em
pire In a formal agreement with
the United States, Great Britain
and France appears to have caused
satisfaction among Japanese as
sembled at Washington. Many
spokesmen referred feelingly last
night of the new era which opens
up for Japan in her relations with
the United States, deeming it one
of the most epoch-making develop
ments in Japanese history as a
world power.
Admiral Baron Kato. the senior
Japanese delegate, said: "I have
feelings of deep satisfaction over
the arranging of this treaty."
It is believed among Japanese
lwre that the conclusion of the
treaty will be received everywhere
in Japan with content, especially
among the younger elements, who
have long been laboring for a
concrete understanding with the
American republic.

CITE BROKEN PLEDGES
Sincerity of Open-Door Stand Taken
at Conference Here Are Se
riously Questioned.
BY PHILLIP C. KAIFFMASS.
The message of hope for future
world understanding and international
co-operation that was flashed yester
day noon from the plenary session
oI the conference to almost every
country on the globe probably struck
of relief and gratitude In the
breasts of countless thousands in all
the great nations of the earth except
one.
Far and wide to distant lands the
telegraph and cables and wireless
have been burdened constantly with
the news that the great powers of
the earth had taken a vast stride
toward ultimate peace and concord,
promising sane reasoning, replacing
mad might by aggrandizementandag
gresslon. The agreement of the four
?>owerful nations to do away with
ecret diplomacy and to plan ways
of getting together and talk things
I over and the abolition of the Anglo
Japanese pact was greeted as a con
? Crete assurance that the minor de
tails still to be worked out in the
conference would certainly be adjust
ed satisfactorily.^
China Not Thrilled.
/
One country, however, could see
nothing in the news of the day to
J>ring rejoicing, if her delegates to
the parley are representative of the
feelings of her people. That nation
is China. Her representatives, sit
, ting at the conference dealing with
[Pacific and far eastern questions,
j were present at the open session of
j yesterday and voted assent-on all
j the proposals, but no thrill passed
| through them at see,ing the light that
i meant the rehabilitation of their
| native land. The day brought noth
I ing that could assure them of the
realization of any of their hopes.
According to an official view of the
delegates, China's status remained
unchanged.
In the words of one of the officials
of the Chinese delegation, an Ameri
can university man, "China has to be
shown." Whatever province in China
corresponds to Missouri, that must
be the home of the Chinese delegates
to this conference, because at this
'time their slogan is "seeing"is be
' lieving."
j "What do these agreements to re
! spect tt?? rights of China mean*?" ask
members of the delegation. "Is there
! anything new that has been promised

Toward Proposals.
Oreat enthusiasm for the proposed
^uur-power treaty on the Pacific is
lands laid before the Washington
conference yesterday was voiced by
members of the Senate who will have
to pass on the pact.
Many of them listened to the read
ing of the treaty by Senator 1-odge.
chairman of the Senate foreign rela
Itions committee and republican lead
er of the Senate, in Memorial Con
tinental Hall and applauded it vig
orously.
The general opinion appeared to
be that much had been gained
the elimination of the Anglo-Japan
ese alliance, and that the treaty does
not fommit the United States to any
talliahce or to an agreement in viola
tion of the traditional policy of the
I United States with regard to entan
jglements abroad.
| Irreconcilable* Thinned Out.
That there will be opposition from
some of the senators who fought the
league of nations covenant, the so
called irreconcilable?, was evident. On
the other hand, the irreconctlables
will find their ranks somewhat
thinned out. Senator Norris of Ne
braska, for .instance, was one of
those who indicated that he would
not vote against ratification, and he
was a strong opponent of the Ver
sailles treaty. Some of the Irrecon- i
cilables refused to allow themselves
to be quoted.
It is expected that in the fight
which will be made against the
treaty reservations similar fo those
offered by Senator Lodge to the Ver
sailles treaty when it was before the
Senate will be presented by senators
opposed to the new treaty.
OpfHillM Develops Early.

Indications of opposition In
Untied States Senate to ratification'
of the four-power Pacific treaty de
veloped today within a few hours
after the new pact was announced
to the world at a plenary* session of
the armament conference.
Senators of the irreconcilable
group, for the most part, withheld
comment, but speaking privatfcly, In
dicated an unfriendly attitude toward
the treaty, while Senator Reed of
Missouri, said he did not expect to
make the fight alone. Senator Borab j
of Idaho, leading Republican Irre
concilable, was one of those declln
| ing to comment, locking himself in
bis office with a copy of the docu
ment. y
Republicans See Success.
Republicans generally, including j
most of the leaders, however, predict- i
fcd ratification of the treaty, by an
I overwhelming vote, and In this pre
diction to a greater or less extent
were joined by a number .of demo
crats. including leaders on that side
of the Senate chamber. Many sena
tors on both sides refused to commit
themselves, declaring they1 wished to |
study the pact, while a considerable |
proportion of the Senate membership
was absent from the capital, owing to 1
the week end recess.
Democratic senators in a number i
of instances said they did not attach I
the importance to the document as a i
I peace measure that was claimed In j
i republican quarters, and described it
as "innocuous" and as having a great
similarity to the league of nations
covenant.
Some democrats ^pointed to article ]
j#of the new treaty, which- binds to I
signatories If their rights in the Pa
cific Islands "are threatened by-the
aggressive action of any other power"
to communiAte '*with one another
fully and frankly. In order to arrive
at an understanding as to the most

ly or separately, to meet the exigen

they said, differed but little from Ar

NAMES WILL BE SIFTED
Ex-Soldier Writes of 14 Being
Thrown Overboard, While Another
Would Tell of 600 Killings.
The names of more than one
hundred former service men were
presented yesterday to the Senate
committee by Senator Watson,
democrat, Georgia, who asked that
they be brought here to testify in
the investigation of his charges that
American soldiers had been put to
death in France without the right of
trial by court-martial.
There was no intimation as to how
I ir.any on the list would be sum
moned, the committee explaining
that it would sift through the names
next week. Assurance, however,
was given Senator Watson that every
person would be called, if'he believed
they were prepared to give testimony
directly bearing on the charges.
fijompared with the turbulant meet
ing Friday the session was extremely
tame. Senator WatsoK the only
witness, read extracts from many
letters in which soldiers declared
they knew of numbers of illegal
executions. One soldier wrote that
on a transport taking him to France
I fourteen then were thrown overboard
and drowned, for no apparent reason.

The Seorgia senator undertook to
show, and Indeed announced rtat he
would prove that the War Depart

t seemed to be a gallows in France, on
; vrhlch a rope was being hooked
around the neck of a _ condemned
soldier, with several officers standing
on the platform and scores on the
ground below, was given to the com

that it was taken by a oolonel, now
I In ttie service. The officer's name
I was not revealed, nor that of his sbn,
who handed it to the senator Friday
night, as the testimony showed.
Senator Watson stated that he de
sired to return the picture last niplll,

being held at eastern police statton.
The confidehce of the guards at the
distillery was gained by means of a

Across the seven seas and from the

the guests of the Gridiron Club to
honor the occasion of its annual .win

lard. They assembled with many of
I the distinguished men of America?'
the President of the United States,
the Vice President. the cabinet, the
Chief Justice of the United States,
the Speaker of the House, other offi
cials of the government and men
' prominent in the large affairs of the ;
country.
It was a novel experience. . bo

i statesmen and diplomats to witness
I the spectacle of an organisation of
writers playing good-natured battle- .
| dore and shuttlecock with American
^politics, legislation and domestic is
sues in such free and lively fashion.
[ They soon caught the spirit of the
event, however, and joined heartily
\ in the proceedings, so devoid of
! aught that could offend the most del
J icate susceptibility and so replete
| with the American temperament and
i its expression in badinage and free
| comment.
Serlotu With Conference.
In treating the subject of the arms
| conference the club for once aban
i doned its traditional forte and dealt
only in serious tone, as was befitting.
A dramatic tableau was presented
by five members of the club, attired
in the military uniforms of the
major powers constituting the arms
conference, entering the hall while
the band played a selection from the
national anthems of the nations rep
resented. Grouped in the center, (he
flags were entwined and a senior
member of the club paid tribute: in
gracious terms to the object of the
conference.
Facing _lhe picture were the dele
gates to the conference and many of
the foreign newspaper correspondents,
together with diplomats and delegates
of other nations, including Belgium,
the Netherlands, Portugal and China.
In the realm of fun the club frol
licked throughout the evening. There
was that Ku Klux scene, which was
made the purveyor of introducing
two new members of the organisation
and gave th visitors from abroad a
visualization of what a Ku Klux
Klan visitation is. They were all
right?barring the white steeds?duly
arrayed In grhostly white and an the
horrific paraphernaliia which the rec

It developed that they were after
Robert M. Ginter of the Pittsburgh
Gazette-Times and William Clabaugh
of Washington, a limited member.
The Ku Klux warned them to leave
at onfce or' Buffer the consequences.
They appealed for protection, which
was declared to be within the -prov
ince of Senator Penrose, then present,

Determination regarding the so
called "soldiers' bonus," but, more ac

made at the present session of Con

is made by the organized ex "ervict

The people of the country feel that
the United States government is In
honor and conscience bound to make
an adjustment to the men who served
in the .war. They feel that the re
publican party now in power has
given its pledge that this would be
done. If the republicans do not keep
that pledge the people will give an
other party an opportunity to keep Its
faith with the service men. That is
the reflex that the big percentage of
men in Congress, irrespective of party
ties, are getting from their visits
"back home" and from the cor
respondence of their constituents.
G. O. P. Leaders Worried.
The republican leaders are admit
tedly worried about the situation.
They realize that if an "adjusted com
pensation" measure is allowed to
come up on the flcwjr of either house
of Congress it wii^ass like wild
flre. Those who will be seeking re
flection next year, ami especially
those who will be making a fight for
the Senate, realise that their posi
tion with regard to a soldiers' ad
justed compensation measure will
have a very powerfaK influence on
their campaign.
Those who some time since, when
the President In a special message
to the Senate asked them to recom
mit the so-called "soldiers' bonus"
bill. Interpreted this as an assurance
that the matter would be taken up a
little later were grievously disap
pointed that he did not propose some
such legislation In his message at the
opening of the regular session. House
'.eader Mondell refuges to discuss
what, if any. place on the House pro
gram is being reserved for the "ad
justed compensation" measure. It Ik
known that several very prominent
party leaders have been in conference
at the White House recently on this
subject.
The action of his home state, Ohio,
