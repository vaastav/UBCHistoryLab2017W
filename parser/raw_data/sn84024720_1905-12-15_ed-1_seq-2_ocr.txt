BE PRESIDENT'S MESSAKE.
President's message is the long
ich ever emanated from the
House. Washington in eight
messages did not write but about
26,000 words, whilst Mr. Roosevelt in
one message gives va 30,000. This
error of the President has called down
upon him not only the adverse criti
cism of the press of his political op
ponents, but of his friends as well.
They all tell him he is too verbose and
Las taken np trivial subjects to the
Injury or neglect of those more impor
tant. The concensus of opinion is also
that he weakened on the great issues.
The great issues were admittedly
the Rate Control of Railroads, and the
Those who hoped to see him leap
upon the railroad rate question with
eyes aflame and sword drawn, dropped
their jaws in disappointment, and those
who had not hoped but expected an
attack such as San Juan Hill would
shrivel to nothingness beside, have
rubbed their eyes and looked again to
be sure they have not been mistaken.
Never was there greater disappoint
ment. His words are so tame and so
mild when he reaches the rate ques
tion as leads some to doubt whether ,
he could have penned them. He says
in part :
"It is not my province to indicate
tbe exact terms of the law which should ,
be enated, but I call the attention of ,
Congress to certain existing condi- ,
nous with which it is desirable to ,
deal." No one inside or outside the ,
railroads was prepared for such a sen
tence. "Desirable to deal," is the
wording. Not essential, important,
absolutely necessary, imperative, ob
ligatory, nor any kindred expression is
used, he only informs Congress that it
is "desirable todeal" withthequestion.
Then he goes on and says, "It some. ,
times happens at present, not that a
rate is too high, but that a favored
shipper is given too low a rate." 'The
public, indeed the railroads themselves,
were expecting him to übb words which
conveyed unmistakably the assertion,
that not "sometimes," but almost
every day and moment.of the day,both
too high a rate and a discriminating
rate are given. But no, the President
did not rise to the situation as he was
expected to do, and the people who be
lived themselves to be great sufferers
both from high rates and discrimina
tions were intensely disappomted,and
the railroad man smiled as he read.and
inwardly remarked, "Why he's not so
warm after all."
Then again, when he came to the
subject of rebates, which everyone ad
mits to be wrong, he is again disap
pointing. Certainly everybody said
"he will give this a solar plexus." But
no. He contented himself with a few
modest blows and ended the fieht. He
did not moralize over it. He neither
called it unjust, unfair, wrong, iniqui
tous, illegal or offensive, and especial
ly did he not say it is criminal. His
recent letter to the Hon. Paul Morton
the apostle of rebates, would scarcely
permit his using severe epithets lest
they reflect upon his former friend and
Cabinet oflicer, and especially have the
(appearance of backtracking.
The other great issue, the Tariff, he
scarcely mentions, at least it is men
tioned in such way as tbat you would
scarcely notice it. He declares that it
is essential to have more revenue.
There was a deficit last year, but he
does not suggest any mode of avoiding
it in future, outside of a recommenda
tion to Congress of economy. He only
once uses tbe words "Tariff laws" in
all of his 30,000 words, and nowhere
does he more than hint at a revision
of them. As our tariff or tax laws of-
Iford the only means of raising revenue
we are left just where we were before
as to what change should be made to
remedy the deficit.
He gives the already prostrate in
surance officer a kick and a cuff, and on
the question of Federal control of in
surance companies he is pronounced
and positive. He works centralization
up to a high degree just here,and if his
advice is followed the federal govern
ment In a few years will control every
thing from a baby carriage up, or down,
as we may prefer to look at it.
Of course he asks for money to com
plete the canal, which is lagging. But
I even here he seems to be indifferent
and careless.
The following summary will lend to
show the number of subjects be treats,
and also to show that many of them
are not national questions. It will also
to show that his recommenda
tions if ever read will in a little while
be forgotten on most of the subjects.
He recommends :
That Congress consider limiting the
hours of labor required of railroad em
ployes and the compulsory use of the
block system and other safety devices.
That insurance be under the super
vision and regulation of the Federal
government.
That Congress consider the question
of fixing maximum and minimum tar
iff rates to be applied to countries
which favor or discriminate against
the United States.
That unnecessary cffices be abolish
ed and more business like methods in*
troduced in the executive departments.
That the publication of campaign
contributions be required by law; that
all contributions by corporations for
political purposes be prohibited by law.
_ That the Santo Domingo arrange-
ment be confirmed by treaty iv order <
to prevent chaos iv that republic. '
That promotions m the army hereafter '
be by selection and not by seniority. j'
Tbat tbe units of the navy be not '
increased in numbers, but that one '
battleship be built each year to replace '
some vessel of out-of-date type.
That a bureau of naturalization be
established and measures taken to re
strict immigrants; that efforts be maae
to prevent the congestion of immi
grants in the Eastern cities and more
of them sent to the Southern States.
That the entire code of United States
criminal laws and laud laws be revised.
That a pension system be instituted
in the life saving service.
That tbe nation care for tbe graves
of the Confederate dead.
That the Pure Food laws aud Copy
right law be completely changed and
made much stronger.
That the Philippines be granted lim
ited free trade with the United States,
r That Hawaii be fortified aud Amer
ican citizenship conferred on the peo
ple of Porto Rico.
That Indian Territory and Oklaho
ma be jointly admitted as one State
and Arizona and New Mexico as an
other.
That Alaska he granted a regular
delegate in Congress.
That the consular system be chang
ed, all consuls put on a fee basis, and
. a corps of inspectors of consulates
created
A SCIENTIFIC BURDEN.
Electrolysis is a word one should get
well in his mouth, because it must be
used if we undertake to discuss the
great torces or alleged forces of today.
The word might be shortened we think
or rendered more easy by having its
form changed, or a portion of its length
amputated. Trolysis would do just as
well, and save much time. Electros
might answer, and since this subtle
agent is doing so much unseen work
and causing so much trouble and talk
and we are to call its name so often,
we would like to make that name as
short as possible, indeed we would be
glad if it were known as E, or Lee, or
Tro, or Ly, or Sis. Any single one of
these would suit us, and the smallest
or shortest would suit us the best. For
instance we could then say E, has eaten
up the electrical engine, or Lee has
laid low the garden hoe, or Tro has In
troduced an atrocious canker lv the
tires of Tommy's tricycle, or Ly has
literally licked the lining out of the
laundry tubs, or Sis has semiperforated
the slop sink in the servants slavatory.
The public would understand it all
just as well as when we used the sci
entific jawbreaker. To be obliged to
use the great scientific term Electro.
Jysis, this multum in parvo, and es
pecially when compelled to get the ac
cent just right, to explain the various
phenomina now going where trolley
cars or electric lights abound, the pon
derous word places a heavier burden
on us than we should be compelled to
bear, especially when it and its ravages
are accompanied by huge and amazing
bills. Just think of it, we may have
to use this word when we see the clothes
line fall, or a hoop go off the bucket,
or a hinge off the gate, or a hole ap
pear in the tin roof, or a quarter rust
down to a ten cent piece, indeed it may
have a close and intimate relation to,
if it has not caused the increase in ap
pendicitis. Let us by all means then
pray the scientists to do for this word
as is done to the appendix, cut it off.
Russia quit fighting armed Japanese
with some disgrace and great prompt
ness. But her war upon defenseless
men, women and children, has taken
ou fresh vigor. Since her Cossacks
butchered defenseless Frenchmen so
frozen that they could not resist, the
Russian has been classed among bar
barians, where he justly belongs.
Since President Roosevelt has been
elected with the aid of money subscrib
ed by many corporations which stole
it from those to whom it rightfully
belonged, he is for putting a stop to
such practices. There would have
been more virtue in his remarks if he
could have made them earlier.
Judge Lewis took no chances when
he ran for Governor. He simply, as it
were, took his chewing gum out of bis
mouth and stuck it under his chair,
where he could get it and chew it
again when he wanted to.
Great Britain has sent a delegation
to examine the idiot asylums of Amer
ica. Their first stopping place will be
Washington where they will visit the
capitol.
The President wants au "elastic
currency." With tbe elastic conscien
ces of the money kings, and an elastic
currency, things ought to bound right
along.
WASHINGTON LETTER.
(From our Keguiar correspondent.)
Washington, L), C, Dec. 9.—lt looks
as though the Panama appropriation
bill will have a stormy time ahead of it
in the Senate. It was conceded tbat
it would be passed by the House with
considerable speed, but even at
that there was $5,500,000 cut from the
amount and all of the members who
had a spite either against the measure
or against tbe president took opportu
nity to vent it. There were some very
caustic things said about tbe payroll
of tbe Commission, some of which
were true and some exaggerated for
party and personal ends. A good deal
of capital was made out of referring
to the $10,000 "press agent" of the
Commission. Now it is quite true
that Mr. Bishop, who is thus designat
ed, is probably over paid, he is really
the secretary of the Commission and
why be should be always spoken of as
the "press agent" metely because he
usually gives out the newspaper state
ments is a little hard to see. There
was some criticism also of the otber
$10,000 men, W. D. Ross, the purchas
ing agent, and li. S. Benson, the audi
tor. Whether these are both good
men it will be possible to judge by ex
perience. If they are, they probably
are not over paid. Tbe purchasing
agent is one of the most important of
ficials under tbe Commission. He has
much more tban any otber one man to
do keeping supplies of all sorts up to
standard and bis opportunities for
graft, if be is dishonest, are limitless.
The auditor is almost equally import
ant, and under tbe government system
of book keeping, he is likely to earn his
salary whatever it is. If thesa two
men are well paid, there will be less
temptation for them to look for money
on tbe outside, and if tflO.OOOeach will
keep them honest in a tropical atmos
phere, which is redolent of graft, tbe
Commission may be spending money
wisely in giving them good salaries.
One thing is certain, and tbat is that
tbe appropriation bill for the Canal
will have to go through in time for tbe
end of December payroll or else the
workers will have to wait for their
money. There is enough money to the
commissions account to meet the bills
up to tbe 15th of this month. But be
yond that there will be a deficit. Tbe

1 since this country is committed to the .
enterprise. There will be a great many
criticisms made as tbe work progresses
But they cannot effect tbe ultimate
j outcome aud Congress cannot prevent
the ultimate success of the project by
niggardliness.tbough it can hamper it.
One of the moves of the warehouse
men's association meeting here tbie
week will appeal to every one who has
to face the problem of the increasing
cost of foodstuffs without a correspond
ing increase of salary. They have peti
tioned to Government tor a federal
cold storage plant. This will necessi
tate an appropriation of 81,000,000 and
the plan may or may not be well work
ed out. But the idea Is to throw the
government in between the peopleand
the food trust which uses the cold stor
age plant to enhance prices. Practi
cally every article of human food is
now subjected to the cold storage
method of preservation and it is the
ability to keep anything from eggs to
beefsteak for a year without spoiling
that enables the Beef Trust, whien
handles a great many things beside
beef, to dictate prices both to the pro
ducer and the consumer. It is most
likely that tbe government cold stor
age idea will never come to anything,
but it is a writhing of the worm in an
effort to turn. Possibly by the time
tbe country is reduced to meat once a
week as a luxury there will be some bet
ter idea than tbe government cold stor
age plant turn up and stand a better
show of passing.
It developes that there are more
roads to fame and competence than
being born in Ohio, graduating from
Harvard or having served in the Bough
Riders. It is rumored that the Presi
dent is about to appoint "Bat" Master
son his personal bodyguard in place of
Mr. Tyree. made United States Mar
shal of West Virginia. There is no in
dication that the President is threat
ened with any particularly pressing
danger or that he is more than oom
monly nervous. But he does love a
man who is light on the trigger. Mas
lerson, the famous ex-sheriff of Dodge
City, only recently came to New York
to accept tbe post of Marshal. But
he has recently had a couple of con
ferences with the President and it is
more than possible that he will be
picked to succeed Tyree. "Bat" al
ways was a handy man with a gun,but
he was decidedly on the Square and be
held down the delicate and difficult post |
of sheriff in tbe days when it was said
tbat there was "no law west of Omaha
and no God west of Dodge City." The
chances are that if he becomes a spe
cial secret man he will never have to
crook a finger on a trigger. But be is
a man who has proved his ability to do
that, when required, and Jhe president
has an especial fondness for a man who
Robbers Use Pistol.
Burglars entered the residence of
Capt. S. H. Cole, superintendent of the
Federal cemetery, Sunday, and stole
$25 in gold. It is not known whether
the thieves were white or black. They
entered by aside window. The 16-year
old son of Captain Cole first discovered
the burglars. The robbers, who had
stolen a pistol from the house, fired
three shots at young Cole, one taking
effect in his thigh, wounding him
slightly.

TYRANNY Of "KING COAL"
Railroai s Form Controlliug Monop
oly of the Nation's Fuel.
Federal Control May be the only Solution
of the Problem now Confronting
The People.
[From Washington Post, Dec. 7 |
There bave b'ieu mauy kings of tbe
eartb. Of tbe Great Kings and Rulers
of ancient times, we lind Solomon and
David; we find the Pharaobs of Egypt;
we lind Alexander and Caesar, aud
later we find other potentates who
have ruled the world with more or lcds
wisdom, or with more or less tyranny.
But today, real kings, such as the an
uients feared or worshiped, are thiugs
of tbe past. Autocrats rule no more
save in but few countries, and iv those
their thrones are crumbling to decay.
In their stead have risen other kings.
We have heard it heralded from tbe
housetops of a portion of our own
country that "Cotton is King." From
another portion has gone out the man
date "Corn is King." From another
"Iron is King." So have other por
tions of our couutry declared as king
some staple or some product which is
peculiar to that section. Such declar
ations by a section, of such imperial
sway or supreme rulership, have not
placed any such product or thing upon
a throne where it could entirely dom
nate human affairs.
Whilst there has beenno declaration
on the subject, the thoughtful man of
today recognizes that there is a KJXS
in this country, and that his elevation
to the throne, is but a ciuestion of a
few years. They see rising in tbe dis
tance a small cloud, black and omi
nous, which in time means serfdom
for the nation. Those who have the
slightest prophetic vision, behold this
potentate lifting his head and grow
ing in horrid deformity each day, and
victim after victim being drawn into
his teils and disappearing into his in
satiable maw, as ships are swept into
tbe maelstrom.
This new king is Coat..
Pause for one moment and think how
tbe world, and especially tbe civilized
part of it,bows subserviently to this ty
rant.and you will be appalled. W itbdraw
it for a moment in mid-winter, and
half our people would starve or freeze.
Every railroad is moved by it. Most
of the factories could not turn a wheel,
and evbry city would be cast into ut
ter darkness but for it. Scarcely a food
product but has its preparation for
human use by means of it. Tbe navies
of the world would float listlessly at
sea, but, for this agent, the machinery
of this Nation would cease to revolve,
and wreos and ruin, famine and pesti
lence. would till the land with honor,
madness and death. The picture in
its detail of horrors we shall not at
tempt; we only desire to thus mildly
allude to the consequences that would
follow certain conditions. Such a con
dition as our failure to have some
coal will never arise, but the condi
tions of having it doled out to us. not
so much as we need it, but in such I
quantities and at such prices as shall
suit the sweet will of a soulless body
of tyrants, is beginning to confront us
with such certainty as to cause the
thoughtful to blanch with fear at the
consequences.
What are the conditions confronting
tbe United States t They are these.
We have carrying and distributing
coal to tbe Nation practically but four
railways. They are tbe Pennsylvania,
tbe Baltimore & Ohio, the Chesapeake
JtOhio, and the Norfolk & Western.
The almost omulcient eye of the man
ag«m«nt of the Pennsylvania Railroad i
long since saw that Coal is King, so ,
when railraad securities had been de |
pressed until they were mere trasb
among tbe assets of our people, aud the
time was at hand, this wily corpora
tion reached out and drew within its
I the B. & 0., the C. & O. and the
W. railways, thus at once con
ing practically all the coal carriers
he United States. This was the
step. Behind each of these cor
tions now is a coal company com
d of the same men practically who
rol the railways, and these are
monopolizing the coal trade. Act
ct, they squeeze out the individual
operator. At a meeting of the
operators on the N. & W. in Phil
phla last year, there were about j
This year there were but 8. The j
rs had gone the way of all flesh,
lat step by step, the operator has
i pushed to tbe wall, bankrupted j
sunk out of sight. At the same ;
s, syndicates composed of the rail
magnate*, are buying every foot
jal land along tbe lines of each j
every one of these railways, and i
v they have acquired "the front," |
se who own lands behind them will ]
ignored and their lands left to j
;" as it were, on their bands, with;
aurchaser, only to be absorbed by
monster who has shut them out of
ket, whenever it shall suit the
sure of the monster to absorb their.
wuing both the railways and tbe
I, it is easy to imagine the rest,
only will tbe Nation soon bow as
viduals to this Kino, but "Uncle
a" himself will soon be found on
bended knees supplicating at this
throne of Grace. Only a little while
ago we beheld "King Carnegie" hold
log up the Nation and making it pay
$600 per ton for armor plate, when the
actual cost of the product is now said
laave been not over $150 per ton.
may we soon see King Coal seated
>n his throne with "Uucle Sam" an
nble suppliant before him, and tbe
people as beggars, holding out their
emaciated hands, asking mercy.
The tyranny of Nero uor any otber
monarch of old days, was never so
brutal as will be that of this New
King—when biß feet have been tirmly j
planted.

ing, why does he not look rnto
