The New York World claims that
there has been a Roosevelt and Bryan
merger and devotes a double column
editorial pointing out the similarity
in Mr Bryans Madison Square Gar

wonderful and no one can read the
editorial without coming to the con
clusion that the utterances of the
two men bear marked similarity

For ages the wicked Emperor Nero
has held a lone and lonesome place

modern ruler let those ancient fel

Mr Bryan has given out an inter
view on President Roosevelts mes
sage and says that parts of it is

WHO WOULD BE A DRONE I
I
Who would be a drone in the hive
Who would be a deserter from the
fight Shall trumpets call strong
men to the field of human effort and
I play dastard Shall flags float by
with brave soldiers marching forth to
the service of duty f and you play cow
ard
Never by the splendor of God
Better the march and thes truggle
and the heartbreak of failure than
the selfish refusal to try
Better the battle the good fight
and the defeat than the craven lurk
ing in the rear
Of all worthless despicable crea
tures under the sun is the man who
can only eat propagate and rot the
venomous coward who hates other
men because they have been bold
where he was timid strong where he
was weak loyal where he was false
Of all things contemptible is the
man who follows with the hungry eyes
of jealous rage and hate the bigger
loftier men who marched while he
hung back toiled while he looked on
fought while he ran away
Give me the man who will live and
die for his ideals who will surrender
no righteous position without a fight
who will perish rather than pollute
his soul by apostasy from Right
Bettera thousand times better
the tempest and the shipwreck with
such a creed than the inglorious rot
ting at the wharf with any other
Better a Waterlooo and a glorious
death in the squares of the Old Guard
than wordly pensions and honors for
base betrayal of cause and country
So I thought at twenty So I think
at fifty
And I have the scars to show for it
And like any other soldier of the
wars I am proud of them
Let the tide ebbit must be so
let the daylight fade it must be so
but this much any poor mortal can
do and should do Hold aloft to the
very last the banner of your creed
fight for it as long as you can stand

sible for you to say to those who love
you

The Movement Against Judge Wall
There is a movement on foot to
have Judge Wall circuit court judge
of the sixth judicial circuit resign
The Lakeland News says that a pe
tition will be circulated in DeSoto
county asking the judge to resign
and the Plant City Courier intimates
that there is dissatisfaction with
him and the movement of the De
Soto people will be seconded in other
parts of the circuit No cause is
given for this extraordinary proced
ure Judge Wall has been on the
honri longer than any of the other
seven circuit judges in Florida He
is one of the pioneers of Florida and
haH always been a man of prominence
and very popular and it is to be hoped
ed that he may be able to vindicate
himself when the charges seeking his
removal are presented
1 he posit on of judge is one of vi
tal importance and all should be of
the best material and in the language
of the Live Oak Democrat our judges
should be made ot better clay than
other mortals for they must sit in
judgment upon our lives our liberty
and Old property rights and men ap
pointed to such work as this should
be of the finest fiber above the mo
tives and temptations of the com
mon heard profoundlywise and
learned and carrying through life
both on the bench and off a person
ality of shining purity as nearly with
out spot of blemish as is possible to
mortals Her strong and stainless
judiciary was one of the real glories
of the old south and there is even
greater need now that it should be
kept up to the highest standard
We dislike to see movements in
our state to force officials out of their
positions as it gives rise to much
comment pro and con and the victim
is made the defendant and the suf
ferer too often unnecessarily Jack

Where will it all end We mean in
reference to our laws Congress is
in session and every senator has any
number of bills that he wants enacted
into laws All the state legislatures
will soon be in session and they will
multiply more laws and so it goes on
from year to year If the nation en
dures lon enough ones whole life
time may well be given to the reading
of our laws with no prospects of wad
ing through them Indeed it will
take a life time to merely read the

THE LAST LEAF
Old age is peculiar in this respect
thatit is never experienced person
ally but is always the object of dis
tant observance Threescore and ten I
seems to be nearer to it than onescore
and ten indeed to everyone but it
self is actually in it Yet threescore
and ten is never old to itself but only
to others Old men are born not
made
It seems strange that youth should
look forward to old age with so much
of terror and distrust when old age
ought to be after all the only pe
riod worth living Men are supposed
to be born young and to die old but
in reality the only natural way for a
man is to be born old and die young
There is a dignity about infancy
that is never attained in after years
However uncouth in appearance the
infant may be the eternal mystery
that surrounds him is awe compelling
Where did he come from is contin
ually on our lips This hoary child
of the ages handed down by nature
as the latest offering of her ma
turity is so venerable with antiquity
that we must perforce admit his claim
to superiority He is older than all
of us inasmuch as he is the last to
come But after awhile we begin to
get used to him The novelty wears
off And by and by when he is sev
enty or eighty or ninety there will
come the time when he really enjoys
his play
As a matter of fact there would be
no excuse for our present actions
in youth unless we expected to reap
the benefits when old The serious
business of education begins with our
swaddling clothes and thenceforth
we are solemnly engaged in the whole
duty of man which consists of rob
bing our neighbors learning when
the truth is to be avoided quieting
our consciences learning how to con
ceal our real selves and striving to
get enough cash in hand to spoil our
children with
All the mistakes of youth are but
a preparation for old age And if we
did not make them we should be
robbed of our just inheritance When
the time comes and we have got
through making them we can go way
back and sit down without loss of
self respect for now it is not expect
ed of us that we should any more be
dishonest or untruthful or lacking in
reverence to establish errors or too
wise All that we need to do is to
be tranquil and look up the avenues
that so often before we have passed
with longing eyes but had no time to
i linger in The past lies back of us
like an ampitheater that we turn
again to with awakened vision and
we who have earned a right to a re
served seat may enjoy the perfor
mance of others in which we once
took part in the calm consciousness
I that when the curtain falls on the
last act it has been after all some
what in the nature of a rehearsal
TOM MASSON
Cromwell Gibbons and the Guberna
torial Nomination
Hon Cromwell Gibbons of Jack
sonville was in Tampa Tuesday en
route to Cuba to wind up one of the
largest suits ever instituted by a
Florida lawyer says the Tampa Tri
bune
The suit in question is that of
Joseph Reyes vs the United States
the amount involved being 896000
The suit is for cattle and horses ap
propriated by the Spanish army for
which the United States government
assumed responsibility
All questions of law have been de
cided in favorof the claimant and
Mr Gibbons goes to Cuba merely for
the purpose of taking testimony that
will prove the amount of the loss sus
tained by his client
Mr Gibbons has been spoken of
quite a number of times as a pros
pective candidate for governor at the
coming election On being asked by
a Times reporter whether he intended
to make the race he replied The
election is too far off for discussion
at present but I think the majority
of them will get tired and drop off
sooner or later I dont believe in
these long drawn out political affairs
for they do good to neither the pub
lie nor the aspirant for office
Mr Gibbons would make an inter
esting race were he to enter the
lists
Tvas a Big Feast for Gamblers
It is to be hoped that the next
state fair will be more of a fair and
less of a sideshow A few high class
attractions such as the hippodrome
are all right but to have a mile of
fake shows as a drawing card is an
insult to the intelligence of the peo
ple of the state There were scores
of gambling devices which cleaned
many a young man out of his ready
money We watched one wheel of
fortune where six cappers were in
league with the manager the suckers
butted in to win big money the same
as the cappers did and came out of
the game in a few minutes without
enough cash to buy a roast beef sand
wich The fair is an educator This
last fair certainly gave an excellent
exhibition of gambling It is time to

SOBS AT CRAPSEYS
FAREWELL SERMON
Dr Algernon S Crapsey preached
his farewell sermon at St Andrews
P E church Rochester N Y last
Sunday morning I
II
The church was crowded to the doors
People stood in the aisles and filled
the vestibules
Although Dr Crapsey made no ref
erence to his departure from the
church many sobbed aloud and tears
dimmed the eyes of others Dr
Crapsey controlled his own emotion
but his hands trembled
At the close of the service the pur
pliced choir marched out chanting
the recessional with the standard
lowered and bowed heads On the
faces of the boys and men of the
choir were signs of grief
Dr Crapsey selected for his text
Matthew xxi 5 Tell ye the daugh
ter of Sion Behold Thy King cometh
unto thee meek and sitting upon an
ass and the coalt the foal of an ass
These words he said are one of
the many adaptations of ancient He
brew prophecy to the life of Jesus for
which the final gospel is distinguish
ed As we listen to the people that
throng the way of the king we learn
from them that this king is Jesus
the prophet from Nazareth and we
wonder why men call Him a king
for to all external appearances He
is no more than we are He was
just such a man to the outward
seeming as are the millions of work
ingmen who with dinner pails in
hand go forth every morning to
their daily tasks
For thirty years he lived > as child
and lad and youth and man with
others of His age and station and
there was nothing to distinguish Him
from His neighbors At the age of
thirty He entered upon a public ca
reer as a rabbi or teacher in Israel
But still there was nothing to indi
cate that He was a king And yet
men seeing this life in the prospec
tive of history agree with the child
ren of Jerusalem and declare it to be
the only kingly life ever lived in the
world
Jesus was teaching in one of the
synagogues on the Sabbath day and
saw the distress of a woman who at
tended worship and he called her to
him and by the laying on of his
hands and by prayer immediately re
stored her and being made straight
she glorified God before all for this
unexpected deliverance The ruler of
the synagogue who hated the doc
trines of Jesus and envied the honor
tried to veil his enmity with the pre
tense of singular piety telling the
people that they should come for heal
ing in other days and not on the holy
rest of the Sabbath as if the woman
had come there on purpose for a cure
or as if a word and a touch attended
with so beneficent an effect could
break the Sabbath Jesus rebuke of
the malice and hypocrisy of the man
was fully justified
France says that the United States
is a nation without manners and it
looks to us as if there are some
grounds for her saying so The court
ly manners once our proud boast
are fast disappearing Young people
now rarely ever lift their hats to
their elders and the grace of man
ners are fast losing out
Maxim Gorky has returned to Rus
sia He is doubtless a great literary
genius but a poor politician He
imagines that socialism will cure the
ills of Russia Why dont he try de
mocracy first That will be hard
enough to get in Russia
The late Samuel Spencer of the
Southern railway who was recently
killed in an accident on his own road
left his property all to the members
of his i immediate family He made
no public benefactions
Mr E S Spencer has been appoint
ed to succeed Mr Arthur Glass as
division superintendent of the A C
L railway with headquarters in Jack

Written for the Ocala Banner
Out on the sea deaths mystical sea
I knew my loved ones wore drifting
from me
Their eyes sought mine till they
grew so dim
My weeping image was lost to them
Their hands grew cold in mine uutll
Their pulse ceased and their iMfirti
were still
And my beloved my very own
Went bravely out to the STeal un
known
Out on the sea the deep placid sEa
With tender a < ti < Nt tJwy went from
me
And 1 dared not ask tIMID tauter to
stay
I thought with grist my tout would
pine away
For they said Dear on tat for
your sake
The voyage Is one we kxm to lake
Wed feel neither sorror nor ragm
That our ship awaIt with Mtl all
set
Out on the aM the broad restless
sen
Let our freed spirits go graceful
Do not hold us here witk prayer and
tears
From that fair shore that een now
appears
Grieve not dear heart that you are
left alone
For immortals love and etatm their
own
And when you enter deaths mystery
Well come for you over tilt sighing
seas
Out on the sea the great silent MR

Ill hear them call me from far away
As I troad thu lonely hunch some

Ill see glad smllea oer their feiUMrv
