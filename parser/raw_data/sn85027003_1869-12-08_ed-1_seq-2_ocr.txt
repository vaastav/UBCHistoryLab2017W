Ratification of tho Subscription to the
Air-Line Bailroad.
We congratulate the County of Greenville,
and this whole region of oountry, on
I l.o action of tho meeting on Saledoy.?
The whole Argument may be reduced to a
few words All admit the importance of
the Air-Line Uailrosd. If it is built, we
gain vastly by the County subscription; if
it should fail, we ahall have nothing to pay,
and will have (he satisfaction of having
done our duty in endeavoring to secure it.
We thii.k it has been shown that the County
will in no event be railed ?poo lo p?/
more than two years' interest on the subscription
before the Slock will be at par,
and ibe dividtnda will always pay it afterwards,
and in all proaMlity yield a clear
income to the people independent of all the
incidental advantages of the Koad.

The Peabody School,
Tlie immense benefits of this School are
admitted. It is educating our children, and
brings population and wealth into our City.
People from other quartern, feeling assured
that here are good and. permanent, schools,
nra looking te QreeavUlt as a residpnee^?
Some have already coma on this account.
nebd not enlarge on thoauhjeel, hdtbeg
leave to remind the public that an instaU

and that the funds are much needed. ^*e
are sure the friends of the School will fake
much pressure la responding to the tiotice.
Change In Firm.
Dr. Jesse M Wescmorelanp, haa ossocia
ted with him in business our esteemed fallow
ciiiam, Dr. W. H. Davis, who will to
gelher continue the business at the old stand
under thi Mansion House. We doubt if
two cleverer men could have become associated.
The new copartner js well known
to our community, and needs no. Commend
otion here. We think our friend jF.fr* deicrvea
great credit for I\is enterprise and
energy in pushing forward his business and
in building Up in our midst a fir*t claw
drug store. Our titisens will remember
tils', in tlie burning, of Mclle >'s Hall, three
years ago, he was Hurntnod damaged to, n
large extent. Notwithstanding Ihis, lie lias
gone on arisro): like a phrenix froni the ashes.
The latter gentteuian is now io New York,
whither he has repaired for the purpose of
laying in a fuller stock than ever. Thedif
fcrent departments of a drug store will bo
well filled, so he has informed u& A full
line of Christmas goods, for which he has
exhibited sueh excellent, taste in former
yearly pill also receive proper attention,
therefore off citizens would do well to wait
and see after bist'er.m,.
Tho Murderer Killed;
W. K. Tot.nrnr, the murderer of It A*not.rii?

December. It will be remembered that this
man wns arrested nud confinod in Columbia
in the Penitentiary, und mnde his escape, and
has been at lnuge in Abbeville Kir soma
months. State Constable Junto Hoi.i.inshki)
heard of him attending n wedding at a widow
Hixtox's, four miles from Greenwood, and
| vrcnt with a posse of Constables and surround|
cd tho house where Toi.nr.RT was. IIom-iX1
sueh entered and attempted to arrest ToiBKHT.
lie shot Houlinsiich twice, wounding
nun seriously, wncn me inner iirou aim shot
Toi.bkrt through tbo heart, killing him instantly.
Thus hu-< psrished a wretched oriuiinnl.
l'be violent has fallen by the hands of
the violent. Tot.beut provoked his own death.
lioLUNSnen was entirely justifiable ; it
folt-nuteueo; the vengeance of the law was
only aiitlcipatcd.
