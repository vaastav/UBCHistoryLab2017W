PRESIDENT WILSON'S
. MESSAGE
President Wilson's first annual
message to congress was one of the
briefest documents of the kind ever
submitted by a president. Its
brevity, however, is not its chief
recommendation. It is a scholarly
document coucned in language that
the ordinary citizen can under
stand.
Following are the most import
ant points in the message:
There is onlj one possible stand
ard by which to determine contro
versies between the United States
and other Nations and that is com
pounded in these two elements:
Our own honor and our obliga
tions to the peace of the world.
We shall not, I believe, be ob
liged to alter our policy of watch
ful waiting; and then, when the
end comes, we shall hope to see
constitutional order restored in dis
tressed Mexico by the concert and
?energy of such of her leaders as
prefer the liberty of their people
to their own ambition.
What the farmers need and
should obtain is legislation which
will make their own abundant
and substantial credit resources
available as a foundation for joint,
concerted local action in their own
bebalf in getting the capital they
must use.
But we must not allow ourselves
to depend upon extraordinary ex
pedients. We must add the means
by which the farmer may make his
credit constantly and easily avail
able and command when he will
the capital by which to support
and expand his business.
Conscious of this backwardness
and neglect on our part the Con
gress recently authorized the crea
tion of 8 special Commission to
study the various systems of rural
credit which have been put into
operation in Europe, and this Com
mission is already to report. Its
report ought to make it easier for
us to determine what methods will
be best suited for our own far r.
ers. '
The immediate services we owe
the business communities of the
country, is ?o prevent private
monopoly more effectually than it
has yet been prevented. This is a
subject so manysided and so deserv
ing of careful and discriminate dis
cussion that I shall take the liberty
of addressing you upon it in a
special message at a later date than
this.
I feel confident that I do not
misinterpret the wishes or the ex
pectations of the country when I
urge the prompt enactment of leg
islation which will provide for pri
mary elections throughout --the
country at which voters of the sev
eral parties may choose their nomi
nees for the Presidency without
the intervention of nominating con
ventions.
But in the Phillipines we must
hold steadily in view their ultimate
independence, snd we must move
toward the time of that independ
ence as steadily as the way can be
cleared and the foundations thought
fully and permanently laid.
Step by step we should extend
and perfe t the systems of self-gov
ernment in the islands, making test
of them and modifying them as cx
perien je discloses their success and
their failures.
At last, I hope and beli?ve, wc
I
are ftoing to gain the confidence of
the Filipino peoples. By their coun
sel and experience, rather than by
1 our own, we shall learn how best to
i *
serve them and how soon it will be
possible and wise to withdraw our
supervision. Let us once gain the
path andsetout with firm ana con
fident tread up< n it and we shall
not wander from it or linger upon
it.
The people of Alaska should be
given full Territorial form of gov
enrment and Alaska, as a store
house, should be unlocked.
One key to it is a system of rail
ways. Tnese the government should
itself build and administer, and
the ports and"terminals it should
itself control in the interest of all
who wish to use them for the ser
vice and development of the coun
try and its people.
Our Bureau of Mines ought to be
equipped and empowered to render
even more effectual service than it
renders now in improving the con
ditions of mine labor and making
? he mines more economically pro
ductive as wtll as more safe. Tr.e
conservation of human life and en
ergy lies even nearer to our inter
est than preservation from waste
or our Nation; 1 resources.
We owe it in mere justice to the
railway employes of the country, to
provide for them a fair anil effect
ive Employer's Liability Act. Soc
ial justice comes first. Law is the
machinery for its realization and is
vital only as it expesees and cm
bodies it.
We ought to address ourselves
among other things, to the prompt
alleviation of the very unsafe, un
just and burdensome conditions
which now surround the employ
ment of sailors and render it ex
tremely difficult to obtain the ser
vices of spirited and competent
men such as every ship needs if it
is to be safely handled and brought
into port.
CARE REQUIRED FOR
THE WINDOW GARDEN
Particular Attention Should Be
Paid to Water and Shade
for Plants.
(By Li. M. BENNINGTON.)
Pay Btrict attention to the potted
plants as regards water and shade,
for all plants require some shade dur
ing summer, especially from the after
noon sunshine
See to It that plants intended for
winter blooming are not allowed to
bloom now. Pinch off the buds as
they appear.
Pots plunged in the border must be
turned once a week to prevent the
roots striking through the drainage
hole.
Now 1b the time for making cuttings
of geraniums and the like. Keep the
slips damp until well rooted; then
pot. Keep ail buds pinched off until
frost appears and kills outdoor flowers.
The oleander will root quickly if slips
are cut three or four inches long, put
in a bottle of water, and hung in a
shady place.
Seeds of pansies, lautanas, prim
roses, impatient Sultana, and (he like
must be sown now for winter bloom
ing.
If you never have seen the snap
dragon of the present day, and want
spikea of beauty a foot long to glad
den the dark eyes of winter, sow seeds
of the improved snapdragon.
Kill Pocket Gophers.
An orchardtst at Qulncy. Wa'b..
Hays that ho has boon successful In
destroying pocket gophers In the or
chard by digging a hole 2% foot deep
and a foot across. He has found that
the pocket gophers get Into the hole
and are easily killed. Ho reports to
the Western Farmer that ho has
frund as many as 17 pocket gopher#
In one hole.

BE A MAN OF ACTION. ~
Don't Fall Into tho "I'll Do It 8omo
Day" Habit.
"Some day" Is the one day of the
865 that has no place in the calendar
and Is still the most popular day for
making disagreeable engagements. It
is the day that every idle dreamer
chooses to begin the monumental work
that it is to make his fame and for
tune.
Today is always huddled, crowded,
too hot or too cold, too wet or too dry.
Todhy is out of the question. But
"some day" lies in the far golden haze
of the future that seems to have in it
the infinite leisure of eternity. And so
we defer till the more convenient sea
son that never comes what ought to
be done lnstnnter. without taking heed
of our own feelings, our plausible ob
Jections. and permitting the creeping
paralysis of overmuch debate that
keeps the arm from striking while the
Iron is hot.
These prophecies that begin with
"some day" and u good resolution are
rarely converted into the past tense
The man of action makes his plans so
berly and takes the facts where he
can get them that will help him to de
elde what to do. But when his miud
Is once made up he goes ahead without
telling you much about it He does not
boast. He is too conscious of his own
fallibility to be cocksure of brilliant
and secure results.?Philadelphia Led
ger.
SAVED BY QUICK WIT.
A Reply That Won Napoleon and the
Duke of Modena.
lu the French campaign In Italy, in,
which Napoleon 1. tirst began to win
the laurels which subsequently so
abundantly crowned his career, a
young Italian cavalry officer was tak
en prisoner.
Having serious doubts about his
safety, it occurred to the prisoner to
pretend he was a great personage. So
he promised rewards to his captors If
they would inshre his good treatment,
adding confidentially that he was the
Duke of Modena.
He was exceedingly well cared for.
and early next morning he was called
before Napoleon, who was somewhat
puzzled at finding two Dukes of Mo
dena among his prisoners, for the real
duke was also a prisouer. The real
duke angrily asked his counterfeit by
what authority he had assumed the
fille cf Duke of Modcnn. The young
oliicer answered:
"Your gruce. the peril of my situa
tion yesterday was such that had 1
known a more illustrious title I would
not have assumed yours."
The reply so pleased both the duk?>
and Napoleon that he wua forgiven his
deceit.

Brittany's Hair Harvest.
It is at En^ter time that the ourione
"hair harvest" of Brittany Is "reaped"
by the traveling merchants, who go
froth village to villnge buying the beau
tiful hair for which the Breton belles
are famous. This Is later destined to
be made up Into "transformations."
"fringes" and other mysterious ar
rangements with which ladles less
abundantly endowed by nature make
up their shortcomings In the matter ot
"woman's crowning glory." The ell
ents of the hair buyers a?*e chiefly
country lasses In the remoter districts
who are only too pleased to sell thelf
tresses In order to obtain a tittle money
to spend at the Easter fairs. The "bar
vest." however. Is said not to be so
good as formerly, as with the spread
of education and the love of display
many girls prefer to keep their hair.?

Different Thing Entirely.
. This story is being told on a Kan
sas lawyer. The lawyer was arguing
a case before a judge and, desiring to
illustrate by supposing a case, he did
so, as follows: "We will suppose,
your honor," he said, "that your hon
or were to steal a horse."?"No! No!
No!" interrupted the judge, "not at
all, not at all, sir. 'Taiu't a suppos
able case, sir." "Very we!!, begging
your honor's pardon," said the eager
lawyer with more seal than prudence,
"very well, then; supposing that I
should steal a horse."?"Ah, yes, yes,"
said the judge, "that is a different
thing, very different, Mr. X. Pro
ceed, sir."
Henry Ward Beecher's Memory.
Henry Ward Beecher, the centenary
of whose birth is being celebrated,
had a poor verbal memory, Bays the
British Weekly. On one occasion he
gave a notice in his church thus:
"In addition to the notices Just read,
I desire to say that I shall be absent
next Sabbath, and that this pulpit will
be occupied by?ah?by?ah?the?
Rev.? (he became much flushed and
confused). I will not be here next Sab
bath, and. as 1 was trying to say, the
preacher will be?ah?why, I know
him?you all know him?know?'Sam'
will preach next Sabbath. Let us
praise God by singing the?the hymn."
He had no difficulty in remembering
the family name, "Sam," but Rev. Sam

WHIRL i"F THE TORNADO.
Beside It trie Hush of the Cyclone U
Comparatively Harmless.
An uphill lie hi fur accurate English
Is being waged year after year by sci
entific authorities on the weather who
object to having the tornadoes which
rip tlirough towns now nud then or
carry away isolated farmhouses, call
ed "cyclones." The distinction made
by the experts in meteorology is plain,
but the public is wedded to the "cy
clone."
The word has gained wide accept
ance in describing the furious local
storms which rush forward along a
more or less direct path while they
whirl with far greater velocity on a
center which may l>e only a few feet in
diameter. If a boy's top is spun ou
one end of a board and the board is
tilted so that the top slides quickly
aiong it, all the while revolving at
high speed on its point, the onward
sweep of the tornado is closely iral
tated.
It Is the spinning motion which is
swiftest and most destructive. Tne ad
vance of the storm may not be as rapid
as thnt of many n comparatively harm
less gale. The twisting motion is esti
mated at not less than 200 miles an
hour In the worst tornadoes.
The true cyclone of the West Indies
the China sea and other parts of the
tropics Is entirely different. Its force
Is spent in a furious wind that seems
to blow almost straight ahead, while
the storm revolves, more or less, fully,
around a circle the circumference of
which may he many hundred miles A
tornado wreaks its fury on a strip of
Innd usually only a mile or less in
width. Tne cyclone sweeps scores or
hundreds of miles of sea or shore.
Rut "cyclone" is Intren lied In popn
lnr usage as the name of the typical
"twister" of this country, and "torna
do" has n poor chance.-Cleveland
