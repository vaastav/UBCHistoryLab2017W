*The assessment of MadiIon County decreased du1e

A portion of this increase is due to the
assessment in Custer county, which here
tofore has not had.a place on our assess
meat rolls, and now comes in with aearly a
quarter of a million of taxable property.
The'decrease in Madison county is due tc
the very low rate fixed on cattle. There
has probably not been any actual falling o.
in amount of property. Beaverhead hau
made proportionally the largest increase,
due in agreat measure to the erection oi
.reduction works and the tax on ores and
bullion.- Some of this general increase msa
be due to the change making only one
assessor in a coa but it i evident bsid

Thq Patterson Case.
WAsurnoroN, Dec., .--The Judge con
cluded his opinion in ,the Patterson case as
follows:
I think I am bound to take judicial cog
niuance that a party organization is one
thing and factions to destroy it another.:
Most cruel tyranny would be the applieao
tion of civil forms of law to the 4omi
sauce and triumph of passions of factions.
I cannot reconcile it to my sense of duty
to give aid in placing manacles and hand
cuffs around and about an individual citi
sea for the purpose of delivering him bound
into the hands of those who may not be
dispassrloate enough to vindicate the
true rights of the individual or to those
who might be led by impassionate appeals
to a eoedition of mind that could not re
sign zeal for the correction of wrong, has
tea to the conviction of the innocent. Let
the man be remanded to the body of whieh
be is a member. That body is legally, con
stitutionally, morally and intellectually ca
peitated to dispose of the question Ia
volved and to condemn or acquit.
Judge Humphrey has delivered his opin
ia the habeas eopars case of Senator Pat
terson. He denies the power of South
Carolina to vaceate Senator Patterson's
eommieson, which. must continue until
eoaetitationally revoked is pursuance of
orgaic authority. It could not be said
that Senator Patterson was a fugitive from
Jetice, as be was bere ia the diascharge of
his odaial duties, line all other members
of Congress; and besides he had acted.in
the capacity of Senator, years before the
presmet indietmeat was brought against
him in a South Carolian Court..:

Coach Captured by Indians.
DEADWOOD, November 24.-On Thurs
day the outgoing coach was stopped by In
dians near Sulphur Springs station, about
fifteen miles from here. They fired a vol
ley at the driver and passengers, but all es
caped unhurt by leaving the coach and ta
king to the bluffs. The Indians captured
the coach and horses, they ransacked the
mail bags, and tried unsuccessfully to open
the treasure box. They killed two of the
horses and decamped with the other two.
Several miners from surrounding camps
are reported missing, and fears are enter
tained that they have fallen victims to
the redskins, who are again in the vicinity
in considerable numbers. It is the opinion
of the best informed that these Indians
are part of the large body that are moving
from the Red Cloud Agency to the Missou
ri river, and doubtless the same who at

Chief of the Mes Peoes has a
Talk With Gen. Miles.
N ped Dispatch to the New York Times.
BraxAMci , D. T., November 20.-Gener
al *Ues _td Lieutenant Bailey left for St.
Paul this evening. General Miles had two
interviews or speeches from Joseph to-day.
One was a personal compliment to Gen.
Miles, in which Joseph said they had
fought each other, that Miles had proved
his true friend, that he believed he would
stand by him, &c. Joseph wanted to re
turn to his home in Idaho. He loved his
country as he loved his life. Joseph began his
grievances with the death of a dear friend
by a white man, and an Indian agent who
made $18,000 in one week by building
fences on paper around their farms. Gen.
Miles refrained from telling Chief Joseph
that orders had been received to the effect
that Joseph and his band would be taken
in a few days to Fort Leavenworth. Jo
seph wants to stay with General Miles and
the latter delayed the communication of
his unwelcome intelligence. Gen. Miles,
during his speech at last night's banquet,
spoke highly of the courage and intelli
gence of the Nez Perces, and wanted them
treated well. Joseph, during the 700-rmile
march from the battle field to Bismarck,had
counseled forbearance, and told his people
he expected them to follow him whither
he led them, to live or die. They often
cried and wept hke children over their ill
fate. Joseph cheered them, but not with
out tears rolling down his cheeks. Gen
eral Miles says the reports from the battle
field, as to his oaths, etc., did him injus
fantry came into town to-day with their
pockets inside out, as a hint to the Demo
cratic Congress that they have not had any
pay for seven months.

Result of the Episcopal Convention.
The completed acsa of the Protestant
Episcopal Convention are (1) a canon on
divorce, forbidding any minister "to
solemnize the marriage of any person who
has a divorced husband or wife still living,
if such husband or wife has been put away
for any cause arising after marriage."
This canon is not intended to apply to the
"innocent party to adivorce for the cause
of adultery, or to parties once divorced
seeking to be united again." (2) The
change in the missionary organizition, by
which the General Convention is made the
Board of Missions. The e nvention, at its
triennial meeting, appoints the managers
for each term of three. years. (3) The au
thorizatiun of the English table of lessons.
(4) The creation of two new dioceses in II
Iliols and one in West Virginia. (5) A
number of amendments of existing canons
re ~ made, the most important of which
relate to deposition from the ministry.
One of these amendmena provides that a
clergyman renonoin~g the ministry of the
Protestant Episoopal Church, and thereup
on deposed, shall e bentitled, if there be
no moral obharge ag..iost him to have that
ct pbliply s.tated.-bHarr. Week4ly.

Butte Items.
From the Butte Miner. Dec. 4th.
Barnard & McCaeslaud have tapped the
Andy Johnson lode on Missoula Gulch 25
feet below water, by running a tunnel 5,0
feet. The ore below is richer than above
water, assaying 170, 260 and 619) ounces of'
silver to the ton. The Miier says : Alto
gether the opening of this claim has infused
wonderful confidence into our miners, and
with the development of one or two, more
such bonanzas we may reasonably hope to
hear the last of that bugbear the " water
level."
The postofilce was moved back to its old
quarters last week. The office room has
been enlarvt§d. the walls papered, aud the
some of them provided with the celebrated
Yale locks, have been added, aun a panel
laced in the inner door for the sale of
stamps and issuini of money urders-as
soon as ours is made a money order bfice.
Last Sunday a bsgltar-proof safe arrived

the terse and vyiorous rhetoric of the driver
when heard at that distance sounded like
the gentle cooing of a mother to her first

loaded with staple groceries for Miarches

Roach & Lavalle are importing a shingle
and planing mill from the States.
Last week. an Ogden merchant who was
about to return to Utah from a collecting
tour throughiMontana, purchased of Messrs.
E. L. Bonner & Co., of Butte, a bill of
goods amounting to $850. Those goods
were sold at less than it would cost to buy o
them in the East, in small lots, and pay
freight charges on them at ordinary rates
to Ogden. What better proof could be
asked of the claimn we have so often made,
that Butte is one of the best markets in
Montana to trade in.
