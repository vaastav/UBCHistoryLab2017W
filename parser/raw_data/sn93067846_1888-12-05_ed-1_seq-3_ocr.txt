WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 5.
The Sumter Watchman was founded
in 1850 and the True Southron in 1866.
The Watchman and Southron now has
the combined circulation and influence
of both of the old papers, and is mani?
festly the best advertising medium in
Sumter.
THAT SPECIAL ELECTION.
As will be seen by reference to oar
advertising columns, an election bas
bees ordered for January 9th, 1889,
being Wednesday on the question of
bonding the city to the extent of thirty
thousand dollars, if so much be neces?
sary, to establish aa electric light and
waterworks plant.
Voters must register between Deo.
10th and 24th, inclusive. No unreg?
istered voter need apply.
It ?hus appears that the people will
be called upon to decide what must be
regarded as a momentous question for
the eity of Sumter. We have no satis*
factory information, none that is decis?
ive, to give our readers as to what such
a plant will cost, but we presume that
the City Council must be satisfied that it
will not cost more than $30,000 for
both purposes, or that sum would not
have been mentioned. The gentleman
who was here, Mr. Garden, gave those
figures as approximating the cost, as
we are informed. He afterwards with?
drew his offer but that was only because
he did not desire to keep it open for
months, while the cost of material
might be advanced meanwhile.
So mueh on the general question.
As to the election, as we look on it,
the questions to be decided are these :
1. Are lights and waterworks need
ed ? No two opinions ean exist on the j
subject, from our point of view. The |
present system of lighting, if it may be
so called, costs in the neighborhood of
$1800 a year. For $2500 electric
lights, that will be lights indeed, can
be procured. On this point, we may
consult Greenville and Columbia, which
have such a system in operation.
As to waterworks, will any man un?
dertake to say that we have an adequate
supply of water now ? Vast sections of j
the city are comparatively at the mercy
of the fire fiend, and if we wish to
know how the insurance men rate Sum- !
ter, in point of danger, just remember
' that from 4J to 6 per cent, is asked on
property nearest the best water supply
we have, and nearest to our steam fire
engine. That tells the whole story in a
sentence.
Ten thousand dollars are paid out an?
nually in this city for insurance. The
cost would be reduced one-half if an ad?
equate water supply existed. Had not
that better be saved, even if a portion
of it goes into the waterworks ? It is
aa easy sum in arithmetic.
A step like this, especially in view of
the fact that this city is oo the eve of
becoming one of the most important
railway centres in the State, would be
bound to attract the favorable notice of
investors, and of persons seeking a
place of residence. It cannot fail to
advertise the city, and no one will deny
that what we need is capital and popu?
lation. In our opinion this is Sumter's
golden opportuniny to leogtben ber
cords and strengthen her stakes. A
false economy now will retard the city's
growth to an extent that wiU enable
other competing towns to get ahead,
and keep ahead of her. We must not
forget that other towns are moving, and
will move only the faster when they see
Sumter standing still. We have lost
ground already by our inactivity at
critical times in our history. Let us
not repeat the mistake, nor suffer the
glittering generalities and the plethoric
platitudes of the ever-cautious to make
us shut the door in the face of the prog?
ress that is knocking at iL If now de?
nied, she may never return.
POLITICAL BACK-PATTING.
That portion of the fourth estate
which hath its being at the North, and
represents the. party of great moral
ideas, has been considerably exercised
of late in the effort to express its admi?
ration of the grand character of the
American body politic, which could go
through the ordeal of a revolution such
aa that which bas recently reinstated
the Republican party in power, and yet
possess the self-restraint to refrain from
overmuch erowing on the part of the
victors and an excess of kicking on the
part of the vanquished. It is indeed a
splendid example of the wonderful sta?
bility of our young republic ; or at
least that portion of it which lies to the
South of Mason's and Dixon's line.
Because, after ali, lo what a trilling ex?
tent is the North affected by a change
of administration ? Whichever party
be in power, the North bas all the ben?
efit and advantage of excellent and effi?
cient and respectable Federal office?
holders, but how about the South?
What guaranty have we that our offices
will not be filled with all the broken
c ?wu political hacks and offensive par?
tisans who lorded it over ns in the
olden time ? If there is any portion of
the country that is excusable for kick?
ing, it is the South. AU the recon?
struction, all the financial, industrial
and political crises and revolutions that
have swept over the country since 1865,
have taken effect almost altogether at
the South. AU the woes and sorrows
engendered thereby, all the wounds and
bruises and putrefying sores, have been
the portion of the Southern people.
The war period and the period suc?
ceeding it were times of unexampled
prosperity to the North, while of the
Svuth it can be truly said that nothing
bat the indomitable pluck of ber peo]
aided by ber matchless climate and i
tile soil, baye enabled ber to take
rank she bas and command the resp
of the world, and even draw cap
from abroad which gladly seeks invt
ment here.
And she bas done it in the face

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAG1
We have risen from a perusal of tl
President's Message with fresh and it
creased admiration of his ability ac
patriotism.
After reminding Congress that t\
country has passed the first century <
its constitutional existence, the Pres
debt points out the fact that of lal
years there has been a wide departut
from the safeguards which the Const
tntion throws around the citizen, au
shows that in so far as we depart froi
the provisions of that instrument, ot
republic, as such, is a failure. H
urges that private interests should t
subordinated to public interests, an
Congress should legislate on patriot!
rather than on selfish consid?ration!
He gives examples of what he meac
when he cites the fact that the bill fe
the relief of the Supreme Court hs
failed to pass, while numerous acts of
private nature have been pusbe
through. He attacks boldly the syi
tem of taxation which extorts io a fe'
years two hundred millions of dollar
more than are needed io pay all es
penses of the government, and show
bow the same grasping spirit that foe
ters such an infamous system, is pre
docing the immense monopolies whic
now threaten to oppress the people
He urges revision of this matter, show
the bearing of tariff reform on it, an
also advises earnestly a revision of th
existing wretched pension laws.
He refers to the fisheries questioi
aud the Sackville episode in a prope
and becoming manner. He shows hoi
we are at peace with all the world
that our navy is being put in fine COD
dition ; that the postal service is bette
than ever: *he department of agrien!
ture is doiog good work, aud that in al
respects the country is exceedingl
prosperous.
Mr. Cleveland's sturdy manhood am
hatred of cant and hypocrisy stand ou
in fine relief in hts message. No Pres
ide nt has ever been manlier than he
and h i3 successor will be compelled t
act up to a high standard unless he de
sires to see himself in painful contras
with him when about to lay down hi
trust with the entire respect alike o
political friends and foes.
(From our Regular Correspondent.)
WASHINGTON LETTER.
WASHINGTON. I). C., Nov. 30, 1888.
Mr. Cleveland's last annual uiessag?
to Congress is all complete, and hai
been submitted to bis cabinet at a meet
ing called for the purpose, but what i ti
contents are, nobody outside knows, ot
is likely to know until the document ii
read at thc Capitol Monday. The mern
bers of the cabinet will only say that ii
is a very strong and interesting docu
muent, and that it will be well worth)
of a place along with the other statt
papers which Mr. Cleveland has written.
Speaking of this message reminds mc
that Mr. Cleveland has bren particu?
larly fortunate in never having had auv
'leaks' in bis administration through
which public documents, such as pres?
idential messages, have reached the
public prematurely. His is the first
administration for many years entirely
free of these 'leaks.'
On the eve of the first Thanksgiving
day after Secretary Whitney took
charge of the Navy Department, he in?
augurated the pretty custom of present
iog each one of the four hundred i
ployees of that department with a
fat turkey. The custom has been r
ulariy kept up ever since, and 1
Wednesday the employees of that
partment received for the last time t
practical evidence of the Secretary's
terest in their welfare This year Pc
master General Dickinson followed
good example set by Secretary WI
ney, and presented each of the empl<
ees of his department with the fin
turkey to be had. These turkeys w<
greatly enjoyed. It is extremely don
ful whether the new Secretary of I
Navy and Postmaster General will ?
low the excellent example set them
the Democratic officials.
Believing in the old adage that M
early bird catches the worm,* Represe
tative Cannon, of Rlinois, has opec
headquarters here and begun an acti
canvass for the Speakership of the n*
House of Representatives. Mess
Butterworth, McKinley, Burrows, Re
and company, will however make t
fight interesting as soon as they {
here. It is generally thought tl
either Reed or McKinley will
Speaker.
Democratic members of Congress a
as a rule extremely reticent as to wfa
line of policy they will adopt at t
coming session of Congress ; they neai
all express a desire to confer with th?
Democratic colleagues before comm
ting themselves. An exception to tl
rule is Representative Springer, of II!
nois. He insists that one of the fit
things thc House will do will be to pa
his Oklahoma bill, and that the ne
thing will be to pass a bill for the a*
rr ittance of at least four Territories in
the Union as States.
The clerks in the Government d
partment in this city below the grade
chief are all in an easy state of mir:
just at present. They have becon
convinced that Harrison is a genuii
civil service reformer, and that thei
will be no clean sweep when be com?
in. The principal cause of this beli
was an article in our local papers, take
from the editorial columns of the Ind
anapolis Journal, a paper which
thought to be Harrison's home orgai
which warned the republicans not l
expect a 'clean sweep.' There ma
not be a clean sweep, but in my opie
ion at the close of Harrison's term thei
will not be one democrat in office hei
for each ten republicans now drawin
Uncle Sam's pay. In other words,
don't believe that Harrison will kee
one tenth as many democrsts in offic
as Mr. Cleveland has kept republican:
Harrison's Southern policy continue
to be a subject of general discussio
here. The opinion is almost ucanimou
amoog the members of both partier
that Harrison's administration will b
a very conservative one unless some
thing now entirely unexpected sh oui
occur. ? don't think the South ha
anything to fear at the hands of Hai
rison. If many things that now bav
a somewhat troublesome look are le
severely alone, they will adjust them
selves; chief among this class of thing
is the negro question. I am certaii
from information d?riv?e from repub
Hean sources, that Harrison will appoin
no negro to any prominent federa
office in the South. In fact there i
an undoubted- disposition among repub
Heans to relegate the negro to bael
seats in future. He is no longer o
any practical nse to that party, there
fore they will give him nothing.
When Congress opens Monday it i
doubtful whether either House will havi
a quorum present, unless they come ii
much faster to-morrow and Sunday
There is a growing belief that Har
rison will call an extra session of Con
gress sooD after his Inauguration.
THE LEGISLATURE.
The following are some of the bills tba
have been introduced :
Bj Senator Pope, to establish and main
tain a home for disabUd soldiers and seamei
of the Confederate army and navy ; to repea
the pension iaw of the last session.
By Mr. McCrady, joint resolution provid
iog for an analysis of the acts aDd joint reso
lutions of 1885, '86 and'87, so as to show

the Solicitors.
To prohibibit the imposition by municipa
corporations of licenses as tax upon business.

tions of political parties, and to punish offense.1
committed thereat,
By Senator Moise, to authorize the Manches
ter and Augusta Railway Company to build fi
branch of its road to the town of Sumter.
By Senator Murray, to provide the mode ol
ascertaining the names of registered voten
convicted of disqualifying crimes, and re?
quiring their names to be erased by super?
visors of registration from the registration
books.
By Senator Smythe to regulate the sale ol
real estate under powers contained in mort?
gages. This bill provides that power be con?
ferred upon the mortgagee to make a sale ol
the mortgaged premises in default of the pay?
ment of the debt.
Mr. Tranthaai of Kershaw made an unsuc?
cessful effort to get a special reference on one
bill, viz. : That in reference to refunding a
lax levied on some township bonds iu Ker?
shaw County, which boud3 had not yet been
issued, and could not now be issued, as the
Supteme Court had declared all such to be
uncoQStiutional. He desired the matter re?
ferred to the Kershaw delegation, and was
supported in his wishes by Mr. O'Brien, but
Mr. Moses, General McCrady and one or two
others interposed objections, and ttie bill in
question will go before t?e ways and means
committee.
By Mr. Wilson to amend Section 1 of an
Act entitled "An Act to empower Probate
Judges to administer oaths fully and effect
; ually as other officers."
I By Mr. Haskell, to regulate and provide

ury, and the expenses for maintaing the said
. department sliall be appropriated by the
General Assembly.
By Mr. Wilburn, to amend an art entitled
"An Act to utilize the ?abor of jail and mu
nicipal convicts and io empower the Country
municipal authorities to impose the punish?
ment ot inhor within their respective jurisdic?
tions," approved December 22, 18*3.
Bv Senator Patterson, to amend Sectiou )
of an Act entitled "An Act to permit persona
in the state liable to road duty to pty a corn
j mutation in lieu of working the roads,"
I approved December tlie 24th, 18S5.
j Bv Senator Murray, to impose the punish?
ment of hard iahor upon nil persons convicted
I bv courts or municipal authorities,
i ".Mr. Haskell introduced Resolution, That
thejudiciary coronirtr.ee of the House be re
{ quested to consider what course should be
j pursueJ hy County Treasurers in the matter
I ot taxes to he paid to meet the in ter? st on the
j township bonds issued iu aid of railroads,
i and report suitable resolutions to carty into
! effect f heir'recurornendaiioDH.
Bv Mr. Wilson, to apportion the Represent?
atives of the several counties ot'this state in
the House upon the basis of the United States
census of 18S0. Mr. Wilson asked that this
I hill t?e referred to the judiciary committee,
j but on a division it Aas seut to the committee
! on privileges and el 'CtJouS.
! The first big discussion of the session was
? precipita'ed by the hill introduced by Mr.
: Fowler, of Union to amend Section 2120 of
'< the General Statutes, in relation to the sala
iries of Circuit Judges, by making the same
! $2,500 instead of ?3 500.
! When the bill wns reached on the calendar
j Mr. Brawley mored to strike out the enacting
i words.
1 Mr. Fowler tuen rose aud delivered the first
set speech of the session in fa vs* of his meas*
ure. The people, he said, bad been clamoring
Tor retrenchment and reform, and that these
bigh salaries were grinding the people down,
lt was almost a song io the state that oar
government costs a great deanmore than that
of sister commonwealths ; it cost $45,000
more per year than that of North Carolina.
The House gives the poor, one-legged soldiers
only $50,000 a yea?, and refuses them any?
thing if they have more than ?250 worth of
property.
Yeas and nays on Mr. Brawley's motion re?
sulted, yeas, 50; nays, 65; the House thus
refusing to strike out the enacting words.
When the communication from R. W. Simp
eon executor of the estate of Thomas G.
Clemson, was read there was a considerable
wrangle' as to its dispoiition. Finally, on
motion of Senator Donaldson, it was ordered
to be printed and received as information.
The Town of Fulton to Be.
The railroad known as the Coast Line Ex?
tension ba3 been almost completed as far as
St. James's Church, about a mile and a half
from Fulton, in this County, where we pre?
sume there will be a station that will become
quite a town in the near future. ' From Sum?
ter to this point is about nineteen miles, and
the road is now being finished up for inspec?
tion by the Railroad Commissioner. It is ex?
pected that a regular train will be put cn by
Christmas. We learn that Dr. McLaurin and
Mr. Mason of Sumter, are to put np a mill at
the Fulton Station at once, and enter largely
inte the milling and creosoting business.
That is a fine country, there is plenty of fine
timber, good lands and good people, and we
predict that there will be a prosperous town
it Fulton in the not far distant future. The
road from Sumter to Fulton will be in opera?
tion in about a mooth.- Clarendon Enter?
