ANNUAL MESSAGE
Of the President of the United
States.
Fellow Citizens of the Senate awl House of Hep
resentatives • 1
1 congratulate you on the continued and in
creasing prosperity of our country, Bv the
favor of Divine Providence we have*been bless
ed during the past year with health, with
abundant harvests, with profitable employment
for all our people, and with contentment at home
and with peace and friendship with other
nations. The occurrence of the twenty-fourth
election of a chief magistrate has afforded anoth
er opportunity to the people of the United States
to exhibit to the world a significant example of
the peaceful and safe transmission of
the power and authority of govern
ment from the public servants whose
terms of office are about to expire
i to their newly chosen successors. This exam
! pte cannot fail to impress profoundly the
thoughtful people of other countries with the
advantages which Republican institutions af
lord. The immediat , general and cheerful
acquiescence of all good citizens, in the result
ol the election, gives a gratifying assurance to
our country, and to its friends throughout the
world, that a government based on the
tree consent of an intelligent and
patriotic people possesses elements of strength,
stability and permanency not found in any
other form of government. The continued op
position to the full and free enjoyment of the
rights of citizenship conferred upon the colored
people by the recent amendments to the
constitution still prevails in several of
the late slavoholding states. 11 has,
perhaps, not been manifested in the recent
election to any large extent in acts of violence
or intimidation. It has, however, by fraudulent
practices in connection with the ballots, with
the regulations as to the places and manner of
voting and with counting, returning and can
vassing the votes cast, been successful in defeat
ing the exercise of the right preservative of all
rights, the right of suffrage, which the consti
tution expressly confers upon our enfranchised
citizens. It is the desire of the good people of
the whole country that sectionalism as a factor
in our politics should disappear. They prefer
that no section of the country should be united
in solid opposition to any other sec
tion. The disposition to refuse a
prompt and hearty obedience to the
equal lights amendments to the constitu
tion is all that now stands in the way of a com
plete obliteration of sectional lines incur politi
cal contests. As long as either of the amend
ments is flagrantly violated or disregarded, it is
safe to assume lhatthe people who placed them
in the constitution as embodying the legitimate
results of the war for the Union, and who be
lieve them to be wise and necessary, will con
tinue to act together to insist that they shall be
obeyed. The paramount question still
is as to the enjoyment of the right
by every American* citizen who has
tbe requisite qualifications to freely cast
his vote and to have it honestly counted! WTth
this question rightly settled, the country will be
relieved of the contentions of tbe part. By
gones will indeed be bygones, and political and
party issues wiih respect <o th economy and
efficiency of administration, internal improve
ments, the tariff, domestic taxation, education,
finance and other important subjects will then
receive their full share of attention; but insist
ing upon the nullification of the results of the
the war will unite together in resolute purpose
their support all who maintain the authority of
the government, tbe perpetuity of the Union
and who adequately appreciate the value
of the victory achieved. This determina
tion proceeds from no hostile sentiment
or feeling to any part of the people of eur coun
try or to any of their interests. The irresisti
bility of the amendments rests upon the funda
ment il principle of our government. They are
the solemn expression of the will of the people
of the United Statics, The sentiment that the
constitutional rights of ail the citizens must be
maintained does not grow weaker. It will con
tinue to control the government of the country.
Happily the history ot the late election shows
that in many parts of the country, where oppo
sition to the fiftcenth.amendrnent has heretofore
prevailed, it is diminishing, and is likely to
eease altogether, if firm and well-considered
action is taken by congress. I trust to the house
and the senate, which have the right
to judge of the election returns and qualification
of their own members will see to it that every
case of violation of the letter or spirit of the
fifteenth amendment is thoroughly investigated
and that no benefit from such violation shall ac- \
crue to any person or party. It will be the j
duty of the executive, with sufficient appropria
tions for the purpose, to prosecute unsparingly
all who have been engaged in. depriving citizen’s
of the rights guaranteed to them by tno consti
tution. It is not, however,, to be forgotten that
fihe best and surest guarantee of the primary
rights of citizenship is to> be found in that
capacity for self protection which can only be
long to a people whose right to universal suf
frage is supported by universal education.

The means at the command of the local and
state authorities are, in many cases, wholly in
adequate to furnish free instruction to all who
need it. This is especially true where, before
emancipation the education of the people was
neglected or prevented, in the interest of slavery,
Firmly convinced that the subject of popular
education deserves the earnest attention of the
people of the whole country with a view to wise
and comprehensive action*by the government
of the United States, I respectfully recommend
that congress, by suitable legislation and with
proper safeguards, supplement the local educa
tional funds in the several states where the
grave duties and responsibilities of citizenship
have been devolved on uneducated people, by
devoting to the purpose grants of the pubi c
lands and if necessary by appropriations from
the treasury of the United. States. Whatever
the government can fairly do to promote free,
popular education ought to bo done. Wherever
general education is found,.peace,, virtue and
social order prevail and civil and religious liberty
are secure.
CIVIL SERVICE, REFORM.
In my former annual messages, I have asked
the attention of Congress to the urgent neces
sity of a reformation of the civil service system
©f the government. My views concerning the
dangers of patronage or appointments for
personal or partisan considerations have been
strengthened by my observation and experience
in the exc-cutional office, and I believe these
dang4-s threaten the stability of the govern
ment. Abuses so serious in their nature can
not be permanently tolerated. They tend to be
come more alarming with the enlargement of
the administrative service. As the growth of
the country in population increases the number
of officers and placeman employed, the reasons
are imperative for the adoption of fixed
rules for the regulation of appointments,
promotions and removals; establishing a uni
form method, having exclusively in view in
every instance the attainment of the best qual
ifications for the position in question. Such a
method is alone consistent with the equal rights
of all citizens, and the most economical and
efficient administration of the public business.
Competitive examinations in aid of impartial
appointments and promotions have been con
ducted for some years past in service of the
executive departments, and by my direction this
system has been adopted in the custom houses
and postoffices of the larger cities of the coun
try. In the city of New York over two thou
sand positions in the civil service have been
subjects in their appointments and tenure of
place to the Gyration of published
rules for this purpose during the
past two years. The results of these practical
rules have been very satisfactory and have con
firmed my opinion in favor of this system of
selection. All are subjected to toe same tests
and the result is free from prejudice by personal
favor or partisan influence. It secures for the
position applied for the best qualifications at
tainable among the competing applicants. It
is an effectual protection from the pressure of
importunity winch, under any other course pur
sued, largely occupies the time and attention of
appointing officers to their great detriment in
the discharge of other official duties, preventing
the abuse of the service for the mere further
ance of private or party purposes, and leav
ing the employes of the government,
freed from the obligations imposed
by patronage, to depend solely upon
merit for retention and advancement, and with
thus, a constant incentive to exertion and im
provement. These invaluable results have been
attained in a high degree in the offices where
the rule for apppomtnient by competitive ex
amination Las been applied—a method which
has so approved itself by experimental tests at
points where such tests may be fairly considered
conclusive that it should be extended to all sub
ordinate positions Under the government. I be
lieve that a strong and growing public senti
ment demands immediate measures for secur
ing and enforcing the highest possible efficiency
in the civil service, and its protection from re
cognized abuses, and that the experience refer
red to has demonstrated the feasability of such
measm’es. The examinations in the custom
houses and postofflees have been hold under
many embarrassments and without provision
for the compensation for the extra labor per
j formed by the officers who have conducted
them, and whose commendable interest in the
improvement of the public service has induced
this devotion of time and labor without pecu
niary reward. A continuance of these labors
gratuitously ought not to be expected, and with
out an appropriation by congress for compensa
tion it is not practicable to extend the system of
examinations generally throughout the °ivil
service. It is also highly important that all
such examinations should be conducted upon a
uniform system and under general supervision.
Section 1,753 of the revised statutes authorizes
the president to prescribe the regulations for
admission to the civil service of the United
States, and for this purpose to employ suitable
persons to conduct the requisite inquiries with
reference to the fitness of each candidate in re
spect to age, health, character, knowledge and
ability for the branch of service into which he
seeks to enter. But the law is practically inop
erative for want of the requisite appropriation.
I therefore recommend the appropriation of
$25,000 per annum to meet the expenses of a
commission to be appointed by the president in
accord ance with the terms of this section, whose
duty it shall be to devise a just, uniform and
efficient system of competitive examinations
and to supervise the application of
the same throughout the entire civil
service of the government. I am per
suaded that the facilities which such a
commission will afford for testing the fitness of
those who apply for office will not only be as
welcome a relief to the members of congress as
it will bo to iho president and heads of depart
ments, but that it will also greatly tend to re
move the causes of embarrassment which now
inevitably and constantly attend the conflicting
claims of patronage between the legislative and
executive departments. The most effectual
check upon the pernicious competition ot influ
ence and official favoritism in the be
stowal of office will be the substi
tution of an open competition of merit
between the applicant in which every
one can make his own record with the
sarance that Ins success will depend upon this
alone. I also recommend such legislation as,
while leaving every officer as free as any other
citizen to express his political opinions and to
use bis means for their advancement, shall also
enable him to feel as safe as any private citizen
in refusing all demands upon his salary for po
litical purposes. A law which should thus guar
antee true liberty and justice to all who are en
gaged in the public service and likewise
contain stringent provisions against the
use of official authority to coerce the
political action of private citizens or of official
subordinates is greatly to be desired. The
most serious obstacle, however, to an improve
ment of the civil service, and especially to a re
form in the method of appointment and re
moval has beau found to be ihe practice under
what is known as the spoils system by which the
appointing power bars been so largely encroach
ed upon by members of congress. The first
step in the reform of the civil service must be a
complete divorce between congress and the
executive in the matter of appointments. The
corrupting doctrine “to the voters belong the
spoil.-” is inseparable from congressional pat
ronage as the established rule and practice ol
parties in power. It comes to be understood by
applicants for office and by the people generally
that representatives and senators are entitled to
disbnrsj the patronage of their respective dis
tricts and states. It is not necessary to recite
at length the evils resulting from this invasion
of the executive functions. The true princi
pals of government or the subject of appoint
ments to office as stated in the national conven
tions of the leading parties of the country,
have again and again been approved
by the American people, and have not been
called in question in any quarter. Ihose au
thentic expressions of public opinion upon this
all-important subject are the statement of
principles that belong to the constitutional
structure of the government. Under the con
stitution the president and Loads of depart
ments are to make nominations for office; the
senate is to advise and consent to appoint
ments and the house of representatives is to
accuse and prosecute faithless officers. The
best interest of the public service demands
that these distinctions shall be respected, that
senators- and representatives who may le
judges and accusers should not dictate
appointments to office. To this end
the co-operation of the legislative depart
ments of the government is required
alike by the necessities of the case and by pub
lic opinion. Members of congress wiU not be
relieved from the demands made upon them
with reference to appointments to office until by
legislative enactment the pernicious practice is
condemned and forbidden. It is therefore rec
ommended that an act be passed defining the
relations of members of congress with respect
to appointment to office by the president. And
I also recommend that the provisions of section
1,767 and of the sections following of the re
vised stabites, comprising the tenure of office
act of Marsh 2d, 18G7, be repealed.. Believing
that to reform the system and methods of the
civil service in onr country is one of the highest
and most imperative duties of statesmanship,
and that it can be permanently done only by
the co-operation of the legislative and executive
departments of the government, I again com
mend the whole subject to your considerate
attention..
POLYGAMY.
It is the recognized duty and purpose of the
people of the United States to suppress po
lygamy where it now exists in our territories,
and to prevent its extension. Faithful and
zealous efforts have been made by the United
States authorities in Utah to enforce the laws
against it. Experience has shown that the
legislations upon this subject, to be effective, re
quires extensive modification and amendment.
The longer action is delayed, the more difficult
it will be to accomplish what is desir ed. Prompt
and decided measures arc necessary. Tne
Mormon sectarian organization which upholds
polygamy has the whole pewer of making and
executing the local legislation of the territory by
its control of the grand and petit juries. It
possesses large influence over the administration
of justice. Exercising, as the heads, of sect do,
the local political power of the territory they
are able to make effective their hostility to the
of congress on the subject of polygamy, and
in fact do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy
will not be abolished if the enforcement of the
law depends on those who practice and uphold
the crime. It can only be suppressed by taking
away the political power of the sect which en
courages and sustains it. The power of con
gress to enact suitable laws to protect the ter
ritories is ample. It is not a case for half-way
measures. The political power of the Mormon
sect is increasing. It controls now one of our
wealthiest and most populous territories. Ii is
extending stendilyinto other territories. Where
ever it goes it establishes polygamy and sec
tarian political powers. The sanctity of mar
riage and the family relation are the corner
stone of our American society and civilization.
Religious liberty and the separation of churcn and
state are among the well-established ideas of
institutions. To re-establish the interests and
principles which polygamy and Monnonism
have imperilled and to fully reopen to intelli
gent and virtuous immigrants of all creeds that
our domain which has been in a great
degree closed to general immigration by intol
erant and immoral institutions, ii is recom
mended that the government of the territory of
Utah be organized, I recommend that con
gress provide for the government of Utah by a
governor and judges, or commissioners ap
pointed by the president and continued by the
senate, a government analogous to the provis
ional government established for the territory
northwest of Ohio by the ordinance of 1787.
If, however, it is deemed best to continue the
existing form of local government, I recommend
that the right to vote, hold office, and sit on
juries in the territory of Utah be confined to
those who neither practice nor uphold poly
gamy. If thorough measures are adopted '.t is
believed that within a few years the er„U
which now afflict Utah will he eradicated and
that this territory will in ’good time become one
of the most prosperous and attractive of the
new states of the Union.
PEACE rm. RELATIONS.
Our relations with all foreign countries burr
been those of undisturbed peace and have pre--
Rented no occasion for concern as to their con
tinued maintenance.
THE FISHERIES.
My anticipation ot an early reply from th*
British government to the demand of indemnity
to our fishermen for the injuries suffered by
that industry at Fortune Fay in January, 1878,
which I expressed in my last annual message,
was disappointed. The answer was received
only in the latter pert of April in the present
year and, when received exhibited a failure of
! accord between the two governments as to the
I measure of the inshore fishing privilege secured
| to cm- fishermen by the treaty of Washington of
jso serious a character that I made it the
I subject of a communication to congress, in
j which I rc commended the adoption of themeas
j ures which seemed to me proper to bo taken by
■ this government in the maintenance of the
rights accorded to our fishermen under the
1 treaty, and toward seeming an indemnity for
i the injury these interest bad suffered. A bill
| to carry out these recommendations was under
I consideration by the house of representatives at
| the time of the adjournment of congress in June
j last. Within a lew weeks I have received a
communication from Her Majesty’s government
renewing the consideration of the subject, both
of the indemnity for the injuries at Fortune
Bay and of the interpretation of the treaty, in
j which the previous correspondence had shown
| the two governments to be at variance.
Upon both of these topics the disposition
towards a friendly agreement is manifested by
a recognition of our right to an indemnity for
the transaction of Fortune Bay, leaving the
measure of such indemnity to further confer
ence, and by an assent to the view of this gov
ernment presented In the previous correspond
ence, that the regulation of conflicting interests
of the shore fishery of the provincial sea
coasts and the vessel fishery of our fishermen
should be made a subject of conference and
concurrent arrangement between the two gov
ernments, I sincerely hope that the basis may
be found for a speedy adjustment of the very
serious divergence of views in the interpreta
tion of the fishery clause* of the treaty of
Washington, which, as the correspondence* be
tween the two governments stood at the close
of the last session of congress, seemed to be
irreconcilable.
ARTS AND INDUSTRIES,
In the imported exhibition of arts and in
dustries which was held last year at Sydney,
New South Wales, as well as that now in pro
gress at Melbourne, the United States have
been efficiently and honorably represented.
The exhibitors from this country at the former
place received a large number of awards in
some of the most considerable deposits, and the
participation of the United State* was recog
nized by a special mark of distinction. In the
exlnbtion at Melbourne the fdiare taken by our
country is no less notable and an equal degree
of success is confidently expected.
.SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS.
The state of peace and tranquility now en
joyed by all the nations of the continent of Eu
rope has its favorable influence upon our diplo
matic and commercial relations with them. We
have concluded and ratified a convention with,
the French republic for the settlement of the
claims of the citizens of either country against
the other. Under this convention a commis
sion, presided over by a distinguished publicist
appointed in pursuance of the request of both,
nations by bis majesty the Emperor, of Brazil,,
has been organized and has begun vts sessions
in this city,
INDUSTRIAL. PROPERTY.
A congress to consider means for the protec
tion of industrial property has recently been in
session in Paris to which I have appointed the
ministers of the United States in France and
Belgium as delegates.
WEIGHTS AMD- MEASURES.
The international commission up n weights
and measures also continues its work in Paris.
I invite your attention to the necessity of an ap
propriation to be made in time, to enable this
government to comply with its obligations
under the metrical convention.
RELATIONS WITH GERMANY.
Oiu* friendly relations with the German Em
pire continue without interruption. At the re
cent International Exhibition of fish and fish
eries at Berlin, the participation of the United
States, notwithstanding the haste with which the
Committee was forced to make its preparations,,
was extremely successful and meritorious, win
ning for private exhibitors numei ons awards of
a high class, and lor the country at large the
principal prize of honor offered by His Majesty
tne Emperor. The results of-this great success
cannot but be advantageous to this important
and growing industry There have been some
questions raised between the two governments,
as to the proper efficacy and inteipretation of
our treaties of naturalization,, but recent dis
patches from our minister at Berlin, show that
favorable progress is making toward an under
standing in accordance with, the views ot this
Government, which makes and admits no dis
tinction whatever between the rights of a na
tive and naturalized citizen of the United
States, in practice. The complaint of molesta
tion suffered by naturalized citizens abroad
have never been fewer than at present-
WITH OTHER NATIONS,.
There is nothing of importance to note in
our unbroken friendly relations with the gov
ernments of .Austria. Hungarv, iiussia, Portugal,.
Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and
Greece.
WITH SPATS'.
During the last summer several vessels be
longing to the mer chant marine of this country,
sailing in neutral waters of the West Indie's,
were lired at, ooarded and searched by an arm
ed cruiser of the Spanish government. The
circumstances, as reported, involved not only a
private injury to the persons concerned, but,
also seemed too little observant of the friendly*
relations existing for a century between this
country and Spain. The wrong was
brought to the attention of the Span
ish government in a serious protest
and remonstrance, and the matter is undergoing
investigation by the royal authorities, with a
view to such explanation or reparation as may
be called for by the facts. . The commission
sitting in this city for the adjudication of claims
of our citizens against the government of Spain,
is, I hope, approaching the termination of its
labors. The claims against the United States
under the Florida treaty with Spain, were sub
mitted to congress for its action at the late ses
sion, and I again invite yum- attention to this
long-standing question with anew to a fina[
disposition of the matter.
WITH MOROCCO.
At the invitation of the Spanish government
a conference has recently been held at the city
of Madrid to consider the subject of protection
by foreign powers of native Moors in the em
pire of Morocco. The mi ister of the United
Stater in Spain was directed to take part in the
deliberations of this conference,, the result of
which is a convention signed on behalf of all
the powers represented- The instrument will
be laid before the senate for its consideratiom
The government of the United States has also
lost no opportunity to urge upon that of the
emperor ot Morocco the necessity, in accord
ance with the humane and enlightened spirit of
Uie age, of putting an end to the persecutions
which have boeu so prevalent in that country of
persons of a fatth other than the Moslem and
especially of the Hebrew residents of Morocco.
heloium.
The consular treaty concluded with. Belgium,
has not yet been officially promulgated, owing
to the alteration of a word in the text by the
senate of the United Stages, which occasioned a
delay, during which the time allowed for ratifi
cation expired. The senate will be asked to ex
tend the period for rathication-
DEWIAKK.
The attempt to negotiate a treaty of extradi
tion with Demnaik failed on account of the ob
jection of the Danish government to the usual
clause providing that each nation should pay the
expense of the arrest of the persons whoso ex
tradition it asks.
CHUNA ANX) JAPAN.
The provision made by congress at its last
session for the expense' of the commission
which had been appointed to enter upon nego
tiations with the imperial government of Cluna
on subjects of great interest to the relations of
the two countries, enabled the commissioners
