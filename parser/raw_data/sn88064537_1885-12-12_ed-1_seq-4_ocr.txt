ff ASHDffciTON LETTER.
From Our Regular Correspondent
• Washington, Nov. 30,1885.
On next Monday, at exactly 13 o'clock
31., the Forty-Ninth Congress will be
called to order. The fact has been al
most lost sight of here during the past
few days, owing to the death of Vice
President Hendricks. The question of
the Presidential succession has interes
ted everybody to the neglect of all
speculation concerning the organization
■of the House of Representatives, the
revision of the rules, the fate of Mr.
Randall, the President's message, and
other matters that have been the staples
of discussion for several weeks.
The work of draping all the Govern
ment buildings in black has been going
on since the death of Mr. Hendricks
was announced. The Whito House is
draped as it was at the death of ex
President Garfield. Its great white
pillars are covered with solid black
elotb, with large rosettes in front, and
black streamers fastooned from one
pillar to another. The pillars at the
White House gates arc also covered
with black. The ^ipitol is draped up
to the balcony above the dome, with
very striking effect.
The Senators in the city are continual
ly questioned to learn what they think
should be done to fill the place of Presi
dent of the Senate. The impression
strengthens that the Republican majori
ty will ofler it to Senator Logan. Quite
a number of politicians in Washington
are busily engagea in urging his elec
tion. And yet he is the only man in the
Senate of whom it can be said that he
was a candidate before the people for
the Vice-Presidency and was rejected.
The friends of the Illinois Senator
point to the fact that be was a long
time in securing his re-election to the
Senate, and that he lost the chairman
ship of one committee and positions
on two others by the new Administra
tion, which cut off some of the perqui
sites that belong to the older Senators.
'M ke him President p rotem of the
Senate', they say, 'and thus give him a
nice private room and a little patron
age as a recompense for what lie lost
last March.'
^ The * Loganites * assert that Senator
Edmunds does not want the honor
again, and they talk of his dictatorial
manper in the Forty-Eighth Congfss,
when he was accused of lecturing his
fellow Senators as if they were school
boys. -Every little episode in which
sharp words were uttered in the Senate
last winter is nsed against Mr. Edmunds
by the friends of Logan.
Democratic Senators freely express
their preference for Senator Edmunds.
They think it wonld be eery unwise to
put so strong a partisan as Gen. Logan
so near the President. It might arouse
too great expectations among Gen.
Logan's followers, who are of the most
radical class.
Great pressure was brought to bear
upon the President for the purpose of
dissuading him from attending the
funeral of Mr. Hendricks at Indian
apolis. A number of Senators, Members
of the House, prominent Democrats
and personal friends visited him for the
purpose of urging upon him the impor
tance of remaining in Washington. A
large number of telegrams to the same
effect were received. Their argument
was that the public mind is somewhat
excited, and that the press is comment
ing upon the fact that the death of
President Cleveland would restore the
Republican party to power. This they
feared might tempt another Guiteau to
take the President's life. Mr. Cleve
land's visitors said they did not like to
discuss the question of his death, but
they thought it their duty to advise
iiim to guard his life carefully, as it
was now of more importance than
ever.
At first the President said he did not
feel called upon to consider the ques
tion of personal risk in the discharge
of what he considered his duty. After
repeated piotests against the trip,
however, he intimated a willingness to
be guided by the judgment of men
who were influenced only by a desire to
do everything to insure order.
There is mach talk of legislation to
provide for the Presidential succession.
The Democrats feel much annoyed at
the idea of the Republicans having it
in their power to elect a possible suc
cessor to President Cleveland. If the
latter should die, the law now govern
ing the succession wonld at once be
questioned. It is believed by eome of

The Opening: of Public JLands.
It is stated at the Land Office that un
der the practice oi that office when the
public lauds within a township are
opened to entry through the filing of
plats of survey there was a rush of
speculators and land grabbers who of
ten succeeded in securing the best lands
to the great injury of bona fide settlers.
Moreover, this class of persons were
able frequently to learn when the plats
of the survey were to be received in
advance of the settlers, who were
thereby placed at a disadvantage. To
correct this abuse as far as possible,
the Commissioner of the Land Office
lias issued the following instructions to
local land offices :
Hereafter when an approval plat of
the survey ot any township is trans
mitted to you by the Surveyor General
you will not regard such plat as offi
cally received at and filed in your office
until the following regulations have
been complied with :
1. You will forthwith post a notice
in a conspicuous place in your office,
specifying the township that has been
surveyed and stating tiiat the plat or
survey will be tiled in your office on a
day to be fixed by you and named in
the notice, which shall not be less
thirty days from the date of such notice,
aud that on and after such day you will
be prepared to receive applications for
the entry of lands in such townships.
2. You will also send a copy of such
notice to the postoffices nearest the
land, aud a copy to each clerk of a
court of record in your district, with a
request that the same be conspicuously
posted in their respective offices.
8. You will furnish the pnblic press
in your district with copies of such
notice as a matter of news.
4. You will give such further publi
city of the matter in answer to inqui
ries (for which yoa will charge no fee),
and otherwise as you may be able to do
without incuring advertising expeuses.
King Cotton.
D6morest'8 Mortlily for November.
Before the Civil War cottou was re
garded as our most important uational
agricultural product. So large a por
tion of it was exported that in great
part it paid for our imports of mer
chandise, hence it was said that cotton
was kiug. But altl^ongh still one of
our most important national products,
it is surpassed in value of late years
not only by wheat and com, but by
hay. Last year, the value of our cot
ton crop was about $225,000,000, that
of the wheat crop was $330,000,000,
while the value of corn summed up the
enormous total of $040,000,000. This
year we shall have the largest crop of
corn ever grown, probably 2,000,000,000
bushels, while it is supposed we shall
have fully 7,000,000 bales of cotton.
The mouey value of these products
may not be much larger than those of
last year, because of the increasing
purchasing power of the gold unit, but
the abondance of these crops will give
employment to our railroads and will
enlarge the profits of all who deal in
them. Although our wheat crop is less
than it was last year, nature on the
whole has been prodigal. If there is
suffering anywhere on the glol e it will
be because of the unwise fiscal systems
of the nations. It is monstrous that
any one should be hungry in a world
full of food, or suffer from insufficient
clothing when the machinery for mak
ing clothes is so perfect.

A Buffalo preacher lately took as a
subject for a sermon : " The Duty of
the Nation is the Education of the
r reedinen." He should have said the
' education of the ignorant." The
freed man, made so by the Lincoln
proclamation, is a little old for school
days, aud Ihr bureau was worn out
years ago. The children of freedmen
are getting their share of schooling in
the South. If they are not getting it in
buflalo the good people of that city are
to be blamed.—Picayune. '
Edna Payne, a colored woman aged
disappeared last Saturday in
brand Pointe, and a few days later" her
body was discovered at the "edge of the
Wood near Dr. Walker's place. The
presumption is that she was murdered
because she was a state witness in a
case of burglary in St. Landrv, in
which several colored men were impli
cated.—St. Martinville Heviele.

Although the prohibitionists have lost

of gaining several more parishes be

Mr. David Dudley Field : " My re
cipe for self-preservation is exercise
I am a firm believer in exercise. I will
tell you my mode of life. I am a very
temperate man, and have always been
so. I have taken care of myself, and
as I bave a good constitution I suppose
that is the reason I am so well. You
must ask the Almighty why I have
lived so long, and how long I shall live.
I am perfectly healthy and strong, and,
though I have nominally retired from
the law, I am busy as you see from
morning until night. Another reason I
am so well is that my mind has always
been occupied. I am never idle; io
fact I have no time to be ill.
" When I was a young man I had
very severe headaches. In 1S46 I bought
a horse, and I have not had a headache
since. Every morning I arise at 6
o'clock. I have done so for forty years.
I take an ice-cold bath, dress myself,
jump on a horse at 7 o'clock, and ride
for an hour. I then breakfast and work
at my house until 11 o'clock, when I
walk down-town, a distance of four
miles. I remain at my office until 3
o'clock, then walk home, and dine at
6. At 71 sleep for an half hour after
which I am ready for anything. 1 re
tire between 10 and 11 o'clock. I have
done this for over forty years. I attri
bute iny hardihood to horsebackriding.
Have I ever taken a drink? No, sir,
never, except a glass of claret at din
ner. Like Pere Hyacinthe, I must have
my claret at dinner. Whisky, brandy,
or any liquid of that kind I never
touch.
" My advice to young men is to get
eight hours sleep every night, and
drink only chocolate, coffee, and tea.
The young men of to-day are too fast.
The candle can not burn at both ends
and last long. I have never smoked to
bacco in any shape and never will. Do
as I have done, aud you will be strong
at 80 and probably at 90."
In a telegram from Greensboro, S. C.,
it is stated that Mrs. Martha Wilkerson,
a widow about 40 years of age, living
five miles west of that place with her
only child, a young man eighteen years
old, became infatuated with a young
hired man named Adolph, who worked
for a neighbor, aud was about to marry
him, blit her sou bitterly opposed the
match. He declared he would leave
home forever if the marriage took
place. Last Saturday the mother aud
son had a bitter quarrel. On Sunday
morning neighbors found both mother
and son dead on the floor, each with a
bullet hole through the head. It is not
known who shot the other, but it is sup
posed they agreèd mutually to end their
existence.—Capitolian Advocate.
Dr. W. A. Robertson of St. Landry
parish has bought the Washington Ar
gus, which suspended publication a
few months since, and will start a regu
lar Democratic paper. We wish him
success.—Marksville Keview.
