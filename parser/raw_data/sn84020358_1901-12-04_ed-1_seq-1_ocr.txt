Foreign views of message
GENERALLY WELL MECEIVED IN
LONDON AND BERLIN,
THE CARKINGTON PUBLISHING C
BrltUh Papers From the Viewpoint o
It Literary Power and Wealth
Weighty Mutters Regard It One of
the Most Characteristic and Remark'
able Ever Sent to Congress,
London, Dec. 4. The London daily
papers this morning looking at Presl
dent Roosevelt's message from the
point of view of its literary power and
the wealth of weighty matters discuss
ed, regard It as one of the most char
acteristic and remarkable messages
ever sent to the congress. At the same
time the papers recognize Its conserva
tive and business like moderation, and
that no attempt has been made, as the
Morning Post remarks, "to strike an
attitude or carry his listeners away."
On the whole, however, the newspa
pers are sceptical of any great outcome
from the president's efforts in the direc.
tion of reform of the trusts, anti-an
archism or reciprocity, the Idea being
that the senate will effectually step in
and prevent any great changes in the
existing system.
Most of the papers remark upon the
tone of exultation adopted by President
Roosevelt in dealing with the canal
Question, but they do not show the
slightest disposition to cavil thereat.
The Times, in an editorial on the
president's message, says that It Is
distinguished by clearness, firmness and
reserved strength, which do not require
the advantatious aid of rhetorical pyro
technics or popular platitudes.
"We certainly have no fault to find,"
says the .Times, "with his language to
wards the British government, or, In
deed, with his foreign policy generally.
It is not easy to see how the exclusion
policy can be enforced. The United
States would to-day be poorer in many
of the finest elements of its national
character, if an entrance fee had been
demanded of every settler In the early
days of colonization."
The Times thinks that reciprocity and
the trusts will prove thorny problems
and that the president s cautious hand
ling of the latter will disappoint some
of the passionate social reformers.
The Dally Telegraph says it would
have been an inconveniently disastrous
blunder to have opposed America's
wishes in the canal matter and thus
driven her to build a still greater fleet
than she already contemplates which,
It is safe to predict, will twenty years
hence make the United States the sec
ond sea power In the world.
. The Telegraph thinks that President
Roosevelt's policy Is calculated rather
to diminish than to increase Europe's
exaggerated dread of "the American
danger."
The Standard Is similarly of the opin
ion that nothing In the message need
inl the smallest degree excite anxiety or
apprehension abroad. This paper com
ments upon the president's uncompro
mising assertion of the Monroe doctrine
as somewhat unnecessary Inasmuch as
there is little desire 6n the part of any
foreign power to extend its area of mil
itarism to the new world.
The Morning Post is disappointed
that the message contains no echo of
the late President McKinley's pro
nouncement, "the period of exclusion is
over," and comments mainly upon
President Roosevelt's unexpected mod
eration. The Post says there Is not a line of
the anticipated challenge to the politic
al machine, but rather' a strong dispo
sition to conciliate the republican ma
jority. The Dally Chronicle hopes that al
though President Roosevelt shows great
tenderness for protectionist susceptibil
ities, that his proposed policy is a step
in the direction of free trade. The pa
per considers his cautious and tentative
proposals concerning trusts to . show
that the office of president has a sober
ing effect on the most buoyant of na
tures. Regarding President Roosevelt's
enunciation of Monroeism, the Chron
icle says: "Whether the European na
tions are likely to respect this Ameri
can prohibition much longer, when the
desirable colonizing grounds of the
world are being snapped up in a head
long race, must depend ultimately upon
the ability of the United States to en
force this prohibition.
likely to be carried through upon the
initiative of the United States, than by
that of any other power. An anti
anarchist proposition from Germany,
along the same lines as that of Presi
dent Roosevelt, is probably already on
Its way to the state department at
Washington.
The Vossische Zeitung says the pres
ident's message indicates the fact that
the United States are well In the imper
lalistic path, and that ventures abroad
seems to agree with them.
The National Zeitung alludes to the
strong and confident tone used by Pres
ident Roosevelt and to his large pur
roses. Taking the message altogether it has
been favorably received by both, popu
larly and officially. The references It
contains to the late Express Frederick
are especially appreciated.
IDE DlSASTt.lt ON THE WAliASlI.
Coroner's Jury Expected to Render a
Verdict To-day.
Adrian, Mich., Dec. 3. It Is expected
that the coroner's jury which has been
investigating the cause of the death of
the victims of the disastrous wreck on
the Wabash railroad near Seneca last
Wednesday night, in which so many
Italian immigrants were crushed and
burned to death, will render a verdict
to-morrow. The taking of testimony
was finished this afternoon, unless Cor
oner Hamilton should decide to place
one or two additional witnesses on the
stand to-morrow morning.
The testimony this afternoon brought
out the fact that there were three dif
ferent interpretations among the crew
of the Continental Limited train No. 4
as to the orders under which the tiain
was running. Conductor Martin and
Brakeman Dittman, who understood
the orders correctly, expected to pass
the Ill-starred emigrant train, No. 13,
at Seneca and train No. 3 at Sand
Creek. Engineer Strong understood
that he was to pass train No. 3 and
the emigrant train both at Sand Creek.
Fireman Bastien testified that he be
lieved they were to pass the emigrant
train at Sand Creek and No. 3 at Sene
ca, just the reverse of the way the or
ders read.
In reply to a point-blank question of
the prosecutor Engineer Strong admit
ted that it was his misunderstanding
of the orders that caused the wreck,
Conductor Martin and Engineer Strong,
of the wrecked train, both testified at
the morning session.

CAVSES MILD THRILL IN GERMANY
Message Stimulates Bourse bat Ceases
Shipping Shares to Fall.
1 Berlin, Dec. 8. The message of Pres
ident Roosevelt caused a mild thrill in
Germany. On the Boerse, where it
was eagerly awaited, the message was
received with uncommon interest, and
the market generally was slightly stim
ulated upon the posting of a bulletlng
containing President Roiosevelt s utter
ances about "trusts." The shares of
the steamship companies fell one or
two points on account of the Immigra
tion Inspection paragraph and proposed
development of the merchant marine.
Several of the financial journals aver
that there is no reason why the United
States should not encourage ship
building. They say that if the United
States becomes possessed of a com
mercial fleet she will hnvp to huild it,
Insomuch as the attempts to buy Ger
man lines of steamers have been de
feated. President Roosevelt's words concern
ing the restriction of immigration con
tain an unpleasant suggestion in the
present time of depression when, as the
Berliner Volks Zeitung says, the hard
tiu es make an overflow of the laboring
population of Europe necessary. The
free trade and liberal newspapers wel
come the reciprocity recommendations,
but regret that President Roosevelt
did not recommend a specific tariff re
duction. The first Impression of the president's
message in German -official circles is
that the repression of anarchists by in
.treoational agreement Is much more 1
Sir C. Fnrness Sails With Contracts to
Bnlld Twelve Vessels.
New York, Dec. 3. Sir Christopher
Furness, M. P., sailed for England to
day,, taking with him signed contracts
for the construction of twelve freight
carrying steamers of from 6,000 to 10,000
tons dead weight capacity, the capital
nearly 14,000,000 to be furnished by
Americans. Besides this he had also
made arrangements with the Clergue
interests at Sault Ste. Marie, Canada,
for the erection of an Immense ship
building plant, to be located at Sault
Ste. Marie, close to the junction of the
'Soo" canal and Lake Superior. Here
will be erected steel works which will
cost approximately $10,000,000, and the
iron and coal fields of Canada will
furnish the raw material.
Before sailing Sir Christopher said
that during the two months he had
spent In this country he had found why
the United States manufacturer is
crowding the British producer. He has
seen here the railroad locomotive haul
ing twice the load that Is hauled on the
English roads with half the expense.
Everything else he had seen done on
the same economic scale. Because he
believes Canada is sure to profit by the
greatness of the United States he has
chosen to locate his next project there.
Ice, the drawback In the St. Lawrence
river, will be overcome by Immense Ice
crushing steamers, which will be con
structed for that purpose.
V. OF P. TRUSTEES' MEETING.
$34,000 Given During Past Few Days
Treasurer Resigns.
Philadelphia, Dec. 3. At the regular
meeting of the trustees of the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania to-day Provost
Harrison announced that donations ag
gregating $34,000 had been made to tho
university during the past few days.
Four thousand dollars was received
from Mrs. Thomas K. Conrad, complet
ing the sum of $10,000 necessary to es
tablish a fellowship in the department
of physics to be known as the John
Fries Frazer Fellowship, in memory of
Mrs. Conrad's father. Mrs. Keasbey
and Mrs. Mattison donated $25,000 to
the new medical laboratories. John S.
Wentz gave $5,000 to the new engineer
ing department of the university. The
resignation of George L. Harrison, jr.,
as treasurer of the university was ac
cepted with regret.
Every Word Followed Intently Sev
eral Times There Was Applause and at
the Conclusion an Enthusiastic
Demonstration Resolutions Regard
ing the Late President Introduced 1
Both Houses.
Washington, Dec. 3. Not In years
have the members of the house listened
with such rapt attention to the an
nual message of a president of the
United States as they did to-day to
the reading of the first message of
President Roosevelt.
Every word was followed Intently
from the announcement of the tragic
death of President McKlnley in the
opening sentences to the expression of
the clusing wish that our relations with
the world may continue to be peaceful.
The reading occupied two hours, but
not over a dozen members left their
seats until it was concluded.
Several times there was applause and
at the conclusion there was an enthusi
astio demonstration on the republican
side.
On motion of Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio
that portion of the message relating to
the death of the late president was re
ferred to a committee to consist of one
member from each state to Join a siml
lar committee of the senate to consider
upon and report by what token of re
speet and affection it may be proper
for congress to express the deep sensi
bility of the nation of the tragic death
of the late president. The speaker ap
pointed a committee, headed by Mr,
Grosvenor, and then, as a further mark
of respect, the house adjourned.
The senate listened to the first mes
sage, of President Roosevelt to-day and
adopted a resolution directing the ap
pointment of a committee to co-operate
with a like committee from the house
to -consider by what token of respect
and affection congress may express
the sorrow of the nation over the trag
ic death of the late President McKlnley.
The message was delivered soon af
ter the senate met. The reading occu
pied nearly two and a half hours and
was listened to with marked respect by
the senators. The first portion, deal
ing with the tragedy at Buffalo, exclt
ed the most profound interest In the
senate.
At the conclusion of the reading of
the message, Mr. Foraker, senior mem
ber from Ohio, presented the resolution
relative to President McKlnley and, as
a further mark, of respect the senate
adjourned.

An erroneous Impression was given in
this paper yesterday morning in the ac
count of the L. Kaufmann company fire
that no light was left burning in the

Representatives of the company state
that when they closed the store for the
night they left a light burning conspicuously.

Resolution In the House Aimed at
Crownlnshleld and Sampson.
Washington, Dec. 3. Representative
Williams, of Mississippi, presented the
following resolution to-day proposing a
committee of Inquiry:
Whereas, One E. S. Maclay has writ
ten a "history of the nay of the United
States" which was adopted for use at
the naval academy at Annapolis, and
Whereas, In said history said E. S.
Maclay denounces Rear Admiral Schley
as a liar and a coward, ana
Whereas, Said Maclay Is reported to
haye alleged that the proof sheets con
taining these charges were submitted
to one Captain A. S. Crownlnshleld,
chief of the bureau of navigation of the
navy department, and approved and ac
quiesced in by him, and
Whereas, Said Maclay Is reported to
have alleged that the same proofs were
submitted to Rear Admiral W. T.
Sampson, of the United States navy.
and approved and acquiesced in by him,
and
Whereas, Said Maclay was, at the
time of the writing of the said history,
and is now, in the employ of the navy
department of the United States, not
withstanding the scurrillous character
of the charges made by him in said his
tory, and
Whereas, said facts disclose a stats
of things subsersive of honorable con
duct and consideration among officers
of the navy and employes of the navy
department, now, therefore, be It,
Resolved by the house of representa
tives of the congresa of the United
States that a committee be appointed
by the speaker for the purpose of in
vestigating and reporting to the house
of representatives the truth or falsity of
said statements as made by said Mac
lay, the truth or falsity of the allega
tions that the proof sheets were sub
mitted to and acquiesced in by said
Captain Crowninshield and the said
Rear Admiral Sampson and to recom
mend to the house of representatives
the course of action to be pursued by
the house in consequence of the as
certainment of fact to be made by the
;eaid committee.
WATERS VR Y EL ECTl ON CONTESTED
Judge Cowell Attempts to Oust Demo
crats on a Technicality.
Waterbury, Dec. 3. Judge George H.
Cowell, republican nominee for mayor
of Waterbury, who was defeated In the
city election held in October by E. G.
Kiiduff, to-day gave notice that he
would appeal to the courts for a re
count of the ballots cast in the election.
The agitation for a recount has been
going on in the newspapers since it
came to light a fortnight ago that the
democratic ballots cast in the Third
ward were not printed in accordance
with the form prescribed by law.
Kllduff's plurality over Cowell was
442. It is claimed by the republicans
that, the 791 democratic ballots cast in
the Third ward were illegal in that they
read "For Town Clerk" instead of sim
ply "Town Clerk" as demanded by the
election laws. If these 781 votes were
thrown out it would mean the election
of Judge Cowell by a plurality of 349,
It will also result in the outsing of
every democratic offices elected with
the exception of Town Clerk Brett and
Tax Collector Thorns, whose pluralities
were sufficient to secure their elections
even with the Third ward ballots count
ed out.
It is said that the error In the ballots
was known on election day to the
chairmen of both town committees who,
however, agreed that it was due simply
to a mistake and decided to take no
action. The discovery of the fault by
the newspapers and the ensuing aglta
tion led tothe decision on the part of
Judge Cowell to test the matter In the
courts.
The appeal Is returnable before Judge
George W. Wheeler in the superior
court at Bridgeport next Monday.

CASTELLAN E'S MONEY AFFAIRS
French
Again Come Vp Before
Tribunal.
Paris, Dec. 3. The financial affairs of
Count Boni De Castellane again came
up before a French tribunal to-day
when the court of appeals began the
hearing of the count's appeal against a
judgment obtained in the tribunal of
commerce In favor of the banker Davll
ller. The judgment in Question ordered
Count De Castellane to pay bills
amounting to 2,000,000 francs drawn by
the count In favor of , Charles Wer-
thelmer, the London bric-a-brac dealer,
which were sold by M. Devlllier. Coun
sel for Count De Caxtellane contended
that M. Devlllier had no direct interest
In the bills but was acting for Charles
Wethelrner and that, this 1 invalidated
the previous judgment. The court ad
journed without rendering a decision.
SIOLEN HORSES RECOVERED.
Those Taken from Wi Ilnven Found
In Mantle
Clinton, Dec. 3, Two men in single
teams drove up to the freight house
here this morning and asked the sta
tion agent to ehip the horses to Provi-
ence. The horses were put in a freight
car attached to the train leaving here
at 10:30, the two men accompanying
them. Upon their arrival at Nlantlc,
acting upon a message received from
New Haven, Deputy Sheriff Tubba at
tempted to arrest the two men, charg-
ng them with horse stealing. In this
he was unsuccessful, but took posses
sion of the horses. The men fled to the
woods and have not yet been captured.
The horses answer the description of
fhe ones stolen in New Haven yester
day afternoon. The horses are being
held awaiting instructions from New
Haven.

Decision Against Western Union.
Jefferson City, Mo., Dec. 3. The su
preme court to-day handed down a de
cision finding that the Western Union
Telegraph company was organized un
der the laws of New York and is not a
federal corporation, and that the assess
ment of the company's franchise by the
stale board of equalization is legal and
binding. Suits are pending In various
Missouri counties for the collection of
an aggregate of about $250,000 in taxes.
The decision, in effect,' declares the state
franchise tax law valid.
who for the last year had been warden
of the borough of West Haven, was
defeated yesterday In the annual bor
ough election by the democratic can
didate, ex-Warden Dennis A. Klmber-
ly, and the result was a great surprise
to many. Warden Thompson was
looked upon as being almost sure of a
re-election, for his term in office as
warden had been a successful one and
many permanent Improvements In the
government of the borough 'have been
instituted by him. He was nominated
for re-election, not from his own choice
but because he was literally forced to
take it by his party and by the actions
of certain members of the democratic
party and since the cauous he and his
friends have worked hard for the, re
publican ticket. Mr. Thompson resigns
the place to a man who has had no lit
tie experience in conducting the affairs
of borough as he was warden several
years aeo and doubtless everyythlng
will work along in as smooth order as
for the past year. Mr. Kimberley's

The democrats picked up wonderfully
during the last year and the election
pllims were nearly all plucked by mem
bers of that party. Dr. John F. Bar
nett, democrat, was elected treasurer
by a majority of two over the former
treasurer, James C. Hyde. Last year
Mr. Hyde's majority was a large one.
Dr. Barnett was, up to two years ago,
treasurer of the borough for a great
many years and his friends are glad
that he has been reinstated in his old
office. For many years the newly
elected treasurer carried on the duties
of the office when no compensation
was given in return and his energetic
work Is well remembered by the citi
zens of the borough. The vote or
treasurer yesterday stood: Dr. Barnett
417, James C. Hyde 415. This was the
closest vote In the entire election.
The parties split evenly on the elec
tion of burgesses, each electing three.
The republicans chose Charles F.
Smith, William W. Lines and John J.
Snavely and the three democrats that
will be on the board are John H. Hayee,
Lewis H, Warner and Alfred M. Lock
wood. The other candidates were: Re
publican, S. F. Butterfield. Edward S.
Whaples; democrat, John D. Pond and
Andrew D. Thomas.
Albert M. Domkee, republican, was
elected clerk, the democratic candidate
being Frank W. Sheehan. Mr. Domkee
has been clerk of the borough for a
number of years.
Henry C. Higgins, republican, was
the nominee on both tickets for collec
tor of taxes.
Two democratic assessors were elect
ed and one republican, as follows: Hen
ry C. Thomas, democrat; John H. Lan
fnre, democrat;" Arthur A. Benham, re
publican. Edward G. Mansfield was
the other republican name , on the
ticket.
The borough charter called for the
election of an auditor froiU each party.
James H. Reynolds, republican, and C.
Godfrey Olsen. democrat, were nomi
nated and therefore elected.
William A. Tuttle. republican, was
elected bailiff over James Swanson by a
large majority.
The scratching this year on both tick
ets is said to be almost unequalled in
borough elections. Everybody had out
pasters and they were freely used. Al
most a two-thirds vote was polled, the
bad weather keeping many away from
the polls. Up to 7 o'clock It looked as
though the vote would not be more
than one-half, but during the last hour
the citizens piled Into the town hall In
large numbers. The democratic vic
tory was the talk of the place un to a
late hour last night and it will take the
republicans a long time to get over the
shock.
The borough was never In better con
dition than during Mr. Thompson's
term as warden. Nearly all the streets
were put through an overhauling and
repairs were made right and left until
now the place is in first clans renalr
from one end of the town to the other.

The sleet caused ice to form on the
trolley wires with the result that the
trolley service was greatly disarranged.
The Ice on the wires caused more
trouble than would a heavy snow storm.
Efforts of the Fair Haven and West
ville company were turned toward
keeping the cars on the lines in the city
running on schedule time and in tms
the efforts were quite successful, the
cars in the city being only a little late.
On the suburban lines, however, it
was found to be impossible to adhere
to the schedule, but cars were kept

West Haven line two cars were run
together and when one would get stuck
the other would help it along.
