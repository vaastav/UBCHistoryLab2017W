"The. president, we assume, will Issue

canal" in It. ...:
After reading his message the Japs
areonee more convinced that Mr.
Roosevelt Is the real thing.
"When the president was in Panama
tie did .not exactly see.the canal, but he
lav where the canal ia going to be.
Charlie Blakesley points out that the
president's message this time was al
most as long as one of ' David Over
tnyer's "open letters."
Speaking of peace, iba appears to
have a liberal supply on hand these
days. There isn't even a revolution
rumor abroad down there.
The president used the new fangled
spelling In his message, but you will
notice that most of the newspapers
epelled it In the good old way.
It is said that Lincoln Steffens does
not like the lecture platform but would

the Tokio jingoes do not.
Harry Thaw will eat his Christmas
fiinner in prison. His trial wiH not take

Our. esteemed contemporary, the
"T'okio Jlji, says President Roosevelt has
expressed the idea just as the Japanese
would say it. The Japanese are pretty
imart; but it is doubtful if they" could
do aa good a job of it as T. R. did.
It's all settled now. The Washington

The cause of labor unionism Is not
helped by the disclosures that are
brought out in the Shea, trial In Chica
go. Union men who are wise and who
have the real good of labor at heart
will see to It that such Incidents as have
been disclosed In Chicago and as hap
pen In San Francisco are brought to
an end. The labor organization that
simply asks for fairness and justice
will have the full' sympathy of the peo
ple, but the public will frown upon op
pression by labor, unions just the same
as .upon oppression by trusts. The
worst enemies of legi v.mate organized
labor are- those leaders who" use their
power for extortion and graft, and those
Unions that attempt to hold up and
Strangle Industry as is done In San
Francisco. "A square deal for every
man", demands fairness from the labor
in sanitations as well as for them.
OUR POPUJST PRESIDENT.
The Democrats are claiming that
President Roosevelt has stolen more of
their thunder in declaring for'a gradu
ated income tax, and both Democrat
and Populist read that portion of. the
president's message relating to this sub
ject with great interest. '
But the-old time Populist will read
with even greater satisfaction the stand
taken by President Roosevelt on the
subject of coal lands. The Populists
used to argee in favor of governmen
ownership of coal mines and that they
ought to be run in the interest of the
people just how, they did not state
Now comes President Roosevelt no
only advocating the same thins, bu
he tells in a few sentences how to do
it, .and. he has already taken steps to
bring it about.
This is one of the, most radical de
partures from old time ideas that our
original president has taken. : The fo.ua-
dation for it was laid when" it becam
evident how certain railroads of' the
east absolutely control the anthracite
coal fields of Pennsylvania and are able
to hold up the public for. coal. Later
when Senator LaFollette raised a rum
pus 'about the Indian Territory coal
lands being sold, it became evident
that western roads were frying to
secure the same hold cn the . bi
tumlnous fields that the eastern raods
have on the anthracite ' fields,' and the
sale of the Indian Territory lands was
stopped. Now It is .discovered ' that
there has been fraud in connection with
securing title to coal lands in Wyoming
and Utah, and something is doing ou
there.
- This has all brought about President
Roosevelt's action in holding back the
coal lands from sale to private parties,
and his declaration In favor of holdin
them in the possession of the govern
ment. He does not propose that the
government shall work them, of course
He proposes to lease them to private
companies, under such terms that they
may bring the government a royalty,
and so that the government shall ab
solutely control not only the production
of coal itself in the interest of the peo
pie. but also the means of transporta
tion. The mines, declares the president,
belong to the people and ought to be
operated in the people's interest.
A LESSON FOR LONG.
If Senator Chester ... I. Long will
calmly and dispassionately analyze
some of the results of the recent elec
tion in that portion of the state im
mediately surrounding his own home
the eastern half or two-thirds of the
Seventh district, he will perhaps dis
cover that there are a large and rap
idly increasing number of the kind of
"Populists" that he pronounced Sen
ator LaFollette to be.
The locality designated Is where
"the Long machine" has been reign
ing for years. The people of that lo
cality have heretofore stood by Sena
tor Long. Mr. Long and his friends
have dominated the politics of that
section and have usually named the
Republican legislative nominees. The
people have had confidence lit Sen
ator Long, and anything he desired of
them he received until recently.
Since Senator Long has apparently al
lied himself with the element that is
fighting LaFoliette the senator might
object to the charge that he- is allied
with the corporations the people, the
rank and file, have deserted him.
There will be something like thirty-
two Democrats in the coming legis
lature, and Senator Long's , congres
sional district furnishes one-third oi
them. Potent Fact Numer One.
Nearly all of these Democrats come
from that part of the district where
Senator Long and his supporters are
in control. In the eastern two-thirds
of the Seventh district, including
far west - as Ness, Hodgeman, Ford
and Clark counties, there are eighteen
representatives. Just half of them are
Democrats -and that In a region that
is overwhelmingly Republican, a re
gion that gave E. H. Madison some
thing like 3,500 majority for con
gressman. Potent Fact Number Two.
If Senator Long continues his pres
ent attitude he can conjecture from
this result in his own locality what
will happen two years hence over the
state at large to those legislative can
didates who are known to be favor
able to his re-election to the senate.
The State Journal has in the pas!
been a warm admirer of Senator Long.
It was disappointed when he failed to
be one of the foremost in starting the
fight for rate regulation. Instead he
remained an unknown quantity. This
might have been condoned had it not
been for the attitude he afterwards as
sumed and the spirit he manifested to
wards Senator LaFollette and his
measures.
Senator Long made the great politi
cal mistake of his career in lining up
with the Aldrich crowd and in making
the attacks he has on LaFollette in
the recent campaign. -The senator
may call LaFollette a "Populist" and
all the other harsh names in his
political vocabulary, but the fact re
mains that Kansas worships at the
shrine of LaFollette, and what . the
rank and file of the people of Kansas
desire more than anything else in
politics just now is the election of a
United States senator who will be a
LaFollette sort of a man, a man who
will not only vote right, but one who
will make an aggressive fight for what
is right.
The conclusion that one must draw
from the legislative election in Senator
Long's country is that the "Long ma
chine" has lost its grip on the people.
In the counties referred to the Re
publicans elected representatives in
Kingman, Barber, one in Reno, Staf
ford, Barton, Ruf-h, Comancne, Clark
and Ford. The Republicans were de
feated in Harper, Pratt, one' in Reno,
Rice, Pawnee, Edwards, Kiowa,
Hodgeman, and Ness.
Senator Long's attitude in the pres
ent congress and in the following ses
sion will be watched with interest by
his Kansas constituents.

gressman, a lieutenant governor, an

KANSAS COMMENT
'THE GOOD OLD DAYS!" "
" There -seems, to be far more- cloudy
than sunny days 1ft thlspart of Kansas".
Thus has been, the. cajse, only'-.more and
more so "each year," f6r the; past ten
years. In the old. days. more than .25
years ;ago,-s ninfe-tenUis of bur days
inrougtiouf the year were sunny and
the wind blew nearly all the time. And
those winds were fierce too. - It was
not uncommon for it to blow steadily
in one direction for a week, ten days,
or even two weeks, without letting up
even ' an 'hour. We never 'have such
winds now. - It "does not appear to us
that the wind blows as much here as
it does in Illinois o"r "farther east. In
looking over our files of 1880 we found
a verse written by our Igo correspond

Senator Tillman is an honest man

wo fail to see wherein anything but
evil can come from his Incendiary

will ever again be subjected to negro
rule. Then why all this hysteria?
Why these persistent and un-Ameri-can
efforts to fan the flames of a nat
ural race antipathy and bring on all
the horrors and terrors of a race war?
Does Senator Tillman think the south
is too prosperous and that life and
prosperity are - already too secure?

better and happier if the streets of

every township ran red with-the bipod

- Paid to Wear Diamonds-.
, There are many men in Chicago who
are paid to wear diamonds. The men
tu.it .are paid to wear diamonds are
paid in the hope their example will be
followed by others and that ' in the
spread". the diamond carrying habit
the original payer will get his return.
s j.jie .ousiness of - selling diamonds
outside of tores is a large one, -and one
of the means that the spiiprs hsp to
attract the . buyers Is the display of
uiauiuiius upon tne hands of their
agents. They equip with a diamond
ring a man who they know has a large
circle of friends and acquaintances.
Sometimes they make him a present of
the ring. ' More often for it is not
their policy to give much away they
sell the wearer , the ring at a greatly
icuucea price. ie in return is ex
pected to interest his friends in the
stone.
Often the agent is given a stone to
wear and , he is instructed to tell his
friends that the diamond belongs to
him but that he is willing to Bell it. The
unsuspecting. , acquaintance, thinking
T.na.x- ne win get a better -bargain than
he could. jsecUre at a shop, buvs the
dtamond. !The agent usually has to get
ms .'commission out of the sale price.
One man of whom several of the local
diamond brokers have knowledge has
sold diamonds to twenty-seven of his
inenas.
Many men who do not give all their
time to the diamond business deal in
diamonds as a side line. There are a
few real estate offices in Chicago in
which -diamonds are sold and many
traveling men carry one or more dia
monds as a sort of speculative side line.

Hurry vs. Longevity.
' Not long ago, while traveling, I
chanced to stop at a village on the
river Rhine, where I found an astonish
ing number of old people. There were
a dozen over one hundred years of
age, and. many from eighty years o!d
up to the century mark; yet straight
and vigorous. A woman nearly a hun
dred years old was earning her living
by picking hops; her grandchildren
were middle aged. It was quite won
derful. But there was no mystery
about it: It-was merely the effect of a
simple life spent largely in the fields,
with plain .diet,, consisting of a few
vegetables and fruits, little meat, and
native beer and wine for beverages.
, Nothing can. be-more obvious than
that the very complexity of our mod
ern civilization is shortening our lives.
But of all the evils- that afflict us the
worst and most destructive are hurry
and .worry. . Hurry, drives the. body
machine .beyond Its capacity, while
worry ratks it inwardly. Of the. two
worry is .. probably -the 'worse. Thia
might,, indeed,, -be ca-Upd-.:-': the age ol

edge of different classes of fungi. His
enthusiasm, however, was but indiffer

of his parish, and one day. when calling
aipon one of them, old Miss Locke, he
was considerably embarrassed when
she reminded him of the exact length
of time that had elapsed since he last
paid her a visit.
He began to make excuse for the de

TNE EVENING STORY j
The Governor's Daughter.
. (By Constance D'Arcy Mackay.)
"She stood on the porch of the great
colonial - house, the wind ruffling her
light hair, one hand toying with her
riding whip. Around a corner of the
driveway she caught a glimpse of the
stable boy bringing- her saddle horse;
but it was not him that she looked.
Her gaze was concentrated on a tall
figure coming up the drive, a young
man In a dark suit very much the
worse for wear. Neatness could not
hide the fact that his coat was much
worn at the edges. Nevertheless he
1 carried himself with a certain assur
ance, which the sight of Juliet Arling
ton, . standing erect and expectant Dy
the door, did not In the least diminish.
He mounted the steps. Juliet stopped
playing with her riding whip, and
looked at him inquiringly. ' He raised
his hat.
"Governor Arlington Is at home,' Is
ne not?" he queried. His tones, hko
his eyes, were verv direct.
"I really don't know," said Juliet,
with polite indifference.
Nothing daunted, the young man
reached forward a thin, determined
brown hand and rang the bell.
Juliet gave him a sidelong glance.
"He looks." she . thought, "as if he
would stride up to the house of fate
Itself, knock, on the door and aemana
if opportunity were within." :
She turned suddenly. "I beg your
pardon," she said, "but I believe I
made a mistake just now. My father
went for a short ride before breakfast.
Yet I remember that he came back by
a side entrance. I think he is in his
study. Do you wish to see him?" .
She waved aside the servant who had
come in answer to the bell, and led the
way herself, her trim heels tapping
now on the bare polished floor, now
sinking into rugs so soft that they
made no sound. At the door on the
right of the hall she paused, touched it
lightly with her knuckles, and in re
sponse to the deep voice within In
quiring "What is it, Juliet?" answered.
"A caller to see you,, father," and flung
wide the door. The young man thank
ed her and entered.
When she returned at "luncheon,
eyes and cheeks glowing brightly from
exercise, she found her father in a
very happy mood.
'You look, said JUiier, Denamg
over him. "as if you had found a. gold
mine!"
"Better than that." he retorted
I've found- just the. young .man I
want for my private secretary.
Juliet lauirbed. "Don't you mean,"
she said, slipping into her chair, "Mhat
the young man found you.' "
. The governor chuckled. i guess
you're right," he answered, "and he
(lid it wittjout a mite of pull." He
looked past his daughter, through the
windows, where a stretcn or wooaianq
could be seen, mellowing toward an
turnn. 'Most people find . you that -way.
father dear," said Juliet, with an ap
preciative glance. -
"The best ones do," he mused, a
light on his rugged New England face.
The Arlingtons, father and son, had
been governors of that state whose
granite hills are not more, firm than
the hearts of its people. . , And the
wives of the governors had been wo
men' of tact and breeding, who lived
quietly' and frugally in the great col-
onial house, but-who rose to state oc
casions with a hospitality, that was as
lavish as it was brilliant;
. -"And vou're -very like tfiem; Juliet.
the governor was fond af saying.-. ; If
vo'"ur"'r?i6thd'r was alfve h Would, be
nrnud of the resemblance..- The way
you rule this house and presiae- over it
shows you have a steady heart and
bead, and, your discernment of char
acter, is really wonderful in a girl of
twenty-two.
What is the young man name,
father?" went on Juliet, breaking in
on his revery.
Eh? Oh, you mean my private sec
retary? Faxon's his name. John
Faxon. Comes of a gooa family, . dui
very poor. woritea nis way mruugn
college, and now he's ready for a Job."
"I see. said the rlrl slowly.
The house was very gay that winter
with guests coming and going, and
Juliet came to rely on jonn uaxin
almost as much as her father did. He
was alwavs ready to smooth away ob
stacles, to make the most of difficult
situations. , He was courteous, .clever
and reserved.
The governor's daughter was sur
rounded by suitors. She was the. belle
, g party. But though' rumor . engag-
ed her first to this one and then- to
that, she made no sign.
"When do you intend to give away
that cool, young heart "of yours?' her
father questioned. Ana to whom?
"To the right man at the right
time." answered Juliet serenely, and
tripped away to see the floral decora
tions of the dinner table, for she wai
entertaining a large house" party, and
it was not her custom to leave the de
tails to servants. She was the last to
retire that evening, and as she stood In
the great hall at the foot of the wide
staircase John Faxon lit her candle for
her.. Then he lingered, watching her
as she went up the stairs, the candle's
glow making a soft halo for the pale
gold of her head and the delicate
beauty of her face. Half way up she
paused and looked over the banisters.
Her lips were smiling, her eyes w-ere
dazzingly tender.
''Good-night," said Faxon, half be
neath his breath, still watching her.
"John Faxon," : she said quietly,
"haven't you anything else to say to
me?" ' '
His face showed a battle between
pride and love, and pride assumed the
mastery. He shook his head.' :
"Nothing else." he answered coldly.
But the look of adoration that he gave
her haunted her dreams that night.
and for many nights after.
Outwardly their life went on exactly
the same. Faxon neither sought nor
avoided her. Both went quietly about
their duties; the incident that had so
stirred them seemed utterly forgotten.
Winter melted Into spring,- and Jate
one evening Juliet came In from a
long ramble in her garden. . The es
sence of the flowers seemed still to
cling to her, dewy and fresh and. Inef
fable. Moonlight streamed in the win
dows of the great hall as she entered
it. She went to the quaint mahogany
table for her silver candlestick, and
was aware of John- Faxon standing in
the shadow. Mutely she held out the
candle toward him, and he essayed to
light It for her. His hand trembled.
and three matches went out before he
could accomplish it. He was very pale,
but the governor s daughter was auite
cool and undismayed.
"Thank you, she said as he handed
it to her. She looked adorable In - the
half-light. ,
"Goodnight," said John Faxon, tow-
iiis:. .
Juliet paused: -"Have
you nothing else ' to say to
me?" she asked .mm. -
Nothing else. ' John answered. He
spoke with difficulty.
Juliet cimpiea Dewitcniniy, set down
the candlestick and leaned toward him.
Don't you think it's time you had?"
she oueried, laughing. ...
Juliet!" he criea, "yoii know that I
worship yoti that I ad ' ' A' t

"Is love so cheap a thi s you
speak of It bitterly?" said J - i
Hngton. 'And as for poverty .. ;

"With your help Juliet," lau i
Faxon, brokenly. She was in his - -3
now, her head against his breast.
"Bless me, what's this?" chied 1 '
father, entering, and peering throu -
the doom. -
"It means," flashed Juliet, before
Faxon could speak, "it means that a
candidate for my heart has been elect-
ed after a most exciting campaign." '
"The right man at the right time."
quoted the governor softly, and held
out his hands to them both. (Copyright.
