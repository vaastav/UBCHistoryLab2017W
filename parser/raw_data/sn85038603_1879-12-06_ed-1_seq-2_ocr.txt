It Is not surprising that the stalwarts
of the North should entertain a cling
ing affection for Grant. We are quite
ready to gee the remnants and scraps
of Radicalism left In the South mani
fest an eagerness to fall down and
worship him. But that men or sense
and real patriotism of either party
should (seriously look to him as the
coming man to restore tho country and
bring peace and prosperity and union,
is to us oue of the most singular anom-
oliea of this pregnant epoch of anoui-
olies.
If there is any restorative geuius In
Grant he succeeded in smothering it
during the eight years he held the
presidency, with power almost unlim
ited and a pliant Congress always
ready to register his wishes. With all
these powers and advantages larger
than those enjoyed by any of his pre
decessors, and greater than those
wielded by any modern constitutional
monarch his administration was a
flat failure insofar as the restoration
and harmony of the country are con
cerned. It descended into a disgrace
ful nepotism, was marked by plunder
and corruption on all sides, and settled
down into an embecile, demoralizing
system of Grautism.
Clothed with almost unbound
ed authority during an era in
which a truly great statesmanship
would have made a mark that would
have shown brightly on the pages of
history, what is there iu Grant's ad
ministration that his most servile wor
shippers can point to with pride?
What has he done but play into the
hands of the narrowest, most rascally
and venomous time-servers ? His ad
ministration is a foul blot on the I
American escutcheon. It developed
the stupendous robberies of the whis
ky rings, the trading post corruptions,
and the tomb-stone sacrileges! It
stood as a devouring night-mare upon
the hopes and returning loyalty of the
South. It destroyed, as far as it could,
the returning sense of justice in tho
North towards tho South.
And what is Grant anyhow? A
mere creature of fortunate circum
stancesas a General immeasurably
below Sherman; as a Statesman a
full fledged burlesque. Tho man is
nothing except what the surrounding
circumstances make out of him. His
conception of true statesmanship is
hardly equal to the average cross
roads politician. Intensely selfish,
coarse and brutal in his instincts, too
lazy to work, too ignorant to think, it
is nat ural for him to fall a prey to and
aud to be led by designing and cor
rupt men.
The straits of the Republican party
may drive them again to urant, out,
we do not believe that even that de
structive party is ready to break rudely
over the traditions oi me tamers, anu
menace the country with the perils of
a third term and imperialism. And
for patriots, and especially Southern
patriots, to to talk about accepting
Grant for President, indicates nothing
but a despair for the Republic, and a
reckless desire to hasten its destruction.
But Grant will hardly be nominated
by any party. He would be a goose
to accept the nomination if tendered
to him ; for of all. the men in the Re
publican ranks, he would be the easiest
to beat. There is a species of unsound
sentimentality that would canonize
him as the embodiment of the late
war. There is a decayed veneration
which would keep the spirit of the
war alive in him. But the American
people the true, thinking, patriotic
American people think more of the
country than they do of Grant, and
they are heartily tired of Grantism.
This great Republic is too big for any
one man, ana let any man uuueriaKe
to belittle it by pluming himself as
necessary to it, or to attempt to foist
himself upon it and change the genius
of the Government,and he will quickly
see how sternly and effectually the
American people will rebuke the presumption.
A restoration of Grantism means
the abandonment of Republicanism,
and the inauguration of Imperialism
The country is not ready for this, and
Gen. Grant may be the President of a
Canal Company, but our President he
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAOB
The annual message of President
Hayes Is a long, but fairly written
document. None of the King's Eng
lish is murdered by It. "But it con
tains nothing startling. He takes oc
casion to congratulate Congress upon
the resumption of specie payment, tho
accomplishment of the funding scheme
aud speaks of the era of prosperity
which dates from the first of these
events. Attention is called to the re.
ports and ronews of some of the
sufrircstions of tho heads of the
several departments, and in this
connection he speaks of the
arrears of the business of the
Supremo Court, and recommends
tho creation of ten additional
Circuit Judges Oue of the points of
the message is the President's deter
mination to enforce the Federal laws
which prohibit polygamy. Our boinS
at peace with all foreign nations is
alluded to, and a large portion of the
message is consumed iu commenting
upon the silver service. He reoommonds
the passage of a law that will give the
Indians a title iu foe to such lands as
may full to them by lot; and suggests
the establishment of a department of
agriculture; and for a territorial gov
ernment in Alaska, He also commends
the interests of the Dissrict of Colum
bia, particularly its educational needs, to
the careful attention of Congress.
There are other and minor sugguestious,
but they are not of interest to the gen
eral render.
Vn have had some diiliculty hereto
fore in fixing the responsibility for the
late war. We had an idea that Davis,
and Lincoln and Beauregard and Maj.
Andeison, South Carolina and some
other States North and South, had
some hand in brincine on the clash of
arms. But all our views were false.
The problem has been explained, and
the true cause of the war discovered by
the Greenville Local and Advertiser.
In its issue of Nov. 27th this paper
says: "Only for E. Barksdale and W
P. Harris the war would have been an
Impossibility." We are glad to find
out the truth about it at last, but the
distinguished gentlemen who are sad
dled with the responsibility for the war
will, doubtless, be as much surprised as
we were to learn the fact.
THAT LETTER.
Tub Yazoo Sentinel comes boldly to
the defense of the Democracy of Mis
sissippi against the charge of n timer
ous Democratic journals in the State
that the editors were overlooked in
the dispensation of offices in the last
election. It claims that the Democra
cy of Yazoo showed that they were
true to tho country, by electing Mr.
Colhoun, one of the editors of that
paper, to the office of Assessor. This
fact should be properly weighed here
after when editors enter up their com
plaints against the people for leaving
them alone in their glory upon their
tripods. It shows that the people are
uot altogether joined to their idols.
We notice the statement in our
Texas exchanges that Col. John G.
James has been appointed "President
of the A. & M. College of that State,
vice T. S. Gathright, removed. We
have seen no explanation of this ac
tion, but we are quite sure that if the
Trustees of that College have done
this thing, they have removed one of
the most accomplished and zealous
educators of the South.
The Washington Capital says the
letter that appeared in that paper last
week, which has been attributed to
Senator Lamar, was not written by
that gentleman. Of course it wasn't.
Because it was dated "O , Miss.,"
some individuals jumped to the con
clusion that it munt be our Senator.

GEN. fWEST.
Gen. A. M. West was In'Jackson on
Wednesday, making preparations for a
short sojourn in our city, commencing
early in January and continuing dur
ing the session of the Legislature,
During the last canvass Gen. West
made an earnest effort to divert the
minds of the thinking voters of the
State to the Importance of the currcn
cy that is to say, he drifted gently in
to Greenbackism. But it can be
truthfully said of him, (now :that the
election Is over and nothing is to be
gained by holding the truth in the
buck ground,) that he is not wild on the
currency question, but that his views
are characterized by great moderation
and soundness of conclusions. We
have never for a moment lost faith iu
the patriotism and sterling good sense
of Senator West. The point on which
wediflerred with him materially was
the untimeliuess and bad policy of his
apparent attempt, in the presence of a
sleeping and wi'y enemy, to disinter-
giate the Democratic party upon a
question aud an issue which the State
had no power to shape if he could
have succeeded. This difference, how
ever, was practically removed by Gen.
West in the last days of the canvass.
When the so-called Greenback party of
Marshall couuty yielded to the tender
suit of the Radicals, and consented, to
an unholy marriage with that political
harlot, Gen. West was prompt to repu
diate the union, draw himself aud his
friends out of it, and give his support
to the Democratic nominees. Wheth
er this action saved the Democratic
nominees iu Marshall or uot, it proves
that Gen. West has acted from a high
principle, and whenever the Issue la
presented between Democracy and
Radicalism there can be uo mistake
about what his position aud course
will be.

The excitement created by our publi
cation of one letter from Mississippi,
erroneously attributed to 'the pen of
Senator Lamar, Indicates tho feverish
condition of the publlo mind over the
change now going on iu our form of
government.
The cry sent up at the North, for a
stronger Government than that given
us by the Constitution was responded
toin the affirmative by one voice at
the South, and.the country was startled.
The people at the North have been
educated to the belief that the South
was nn alien enemy made up of a
peoplo without patriotism, and anima
ted by a selfish cruelty, thut made them
unworthy of public trust or national
confidence. It was preached from all
the publio pulpits that a solid North
was necessary to put In the Executive
chair a man stronger than the Consti
tution, that the war might be contin
ued against a solid South, so that the
war power, that overides all law, might
be evoked to teach obedience.
One solitary voice from the South
responded, saying "We will accept the
the situation. You deny us all partici
pation in the Government we resign
all pretentions to such. You say we
arejalien enemies we are alien ene
mies. You want a strong centralized
Government we will aid you in crea
ting it. You want a President elected
for life we will elect such a President."
The leaders were startled, rne issue
was made up for them ere they were
prepared for it. They had been lying
about the condition of the South, and
frightening people from tne stump, that
thv niiirht, cuin votes, and were alarm
ed at their own stories beiug verified.
However well prepared tney migut no
for the strong Government that they
had advocated, aud while waving "the
bloody shirt" from every cross-roads
and scholl-liouse, they feared;the masses
were not yet prepareu, ana mat me re
action would be fatal to their presiden
tial hopes.
It was as if a mountebank, frighten
ing a rustic audience at night with calls
for a ghost, should have a veritable
ghost appear and frighten the mounte
bank. Let us suppose it to be true that half
of our territory is held by an alien ene
my, made up of a people whose fields
we have laid waste, whose homes we
have rendered desolute by a cruel war,
whose manhood we have insulted since
the conquest, by not only bitter words
nf utilise, but a deprivation of the rights
of citizenship and brutal robberies of
the most intainous sort wnao menr
The Union that we made the war to
Inforce is an impossibility, and we have
no choice but that change of govern
ment which will enable us to hold half
our territory a conquered province, as
England holils lielHti, jiussia roianu,
Austria Hungary, and Germany Alsace
and Lorraine. It is not a question to
he settled bv a uouuiar election; it is a
dead issue, buried by the logic of events.
What the political leaders of the
Republican party propose is that while
trampling like beasts upon the people
of South, the people of the South shall
hiivo eiiomrh patriotism not only to
submit humbly to the degredation, but
but hold aloft the republic ot tne latners
and save for all the country the. rights
denied them.
We are rapidiy drifting into civil
war. senator uarpenter, wuen ne
foretold the course of the Democratic
party in the next Presidential contest,
gave point to his prophecy by reciting
in tact tne History oi me ttepuoiieau
organization in the last contest. He
was the attorney then of the Prcsdent
elect, and to appreciate his prognosti
cation now oue should read it by the
light of his eloquent protest then.
We then nut to record in the most
solemn manner that it was possible to
fix a legal precedent that tne voice oi
the people, however cieariy expresseu
through tho ballot, is subordinate to
the will of a faction controlling the
forms through which that voice is ex
pressed. The fact that the Democracy,
through their timid leader, gave way,
and submitted to the inauguration
of a minority candidate, emboldens
that organization to try again; while
the Democracy, the war element of the
land, unburdened by bonds, is prepared
to make the fraud of that day the
violeuce of the next.
The fathers of the republic based its
foundation on a system that is the very
essence of its existence. It was purposed
by those wise and patriotic men that we
should have a self-government so sim
ple in its form, so clearly defined, that
at all times it might be administered
by the people's official agents without
any heavy draft on their intelligence.
They placed more stress on virtue
than intellect, and were uueasy, and
well they might b !, on that score only.
We are satisfied that the masses of
our people yet cling to that form of
government, and are not prepared to
pronounce it a failure, and so call in
"the man on horseback" to save us
from ourselves.
We were guilty of wrong in giving
to the public a confidential letter, but
if its printing has served in the slight
est extent to awaken the popular
mind to our perilous condition we may
be pardoned.

Plaintiff in error filed his petition in tne
Cireuit Court for a certiorari to bring up
the reoord of the proceedings of an inquest
assessing damages for the appropriation of
his land to the construction of a levee on
the Mississippi river. .
' The petition charges that the jury made
their assessment on improper principles,
bnt that thiB is not ascertainable from the
form in which the verdiot was drawn up,
and the prayer is that the writ be granted
iu order that the verdiot may be amended so
as to show the true ground upon which it
is based, so that the petitioner may bring
an aotion for the damages he sustained up
on other and distinct grounds from those
embraced in the verdiot.

1st. The demurrer to the petition was
properly sustained The writ of certiorari
brings up the reoord of the proceedings
sought to be reviewed, and enables the
court into which it is returned to inspect
the record, and determine from that alone
whether there is any jnst ground to disturb
the proceedings sought to be reviewed.
2d. It is insisted that a certiorari will
not lie to review the proceedings of the in
quest, because the statute under wmcn inoy
took place declares that the verdiot shall be
final. We do not regard this provision as
prohibiting a certiorari, but only as pre
venting a reinvestigation of the facts upon
a return of the writ. j
3d. As the sole objeot of the petition !
was to have the verdict amended, which is j
incompetent to be done, we affirm the
jmlgmeut. The petitioner may prooeed
again in the regular way, and on the return
of the certiorari may have the proceedings
fully reviewed. If they are touna correct,
the proceeding of the inquest will be
affirmed, otherwise they will be quashed.

The appearance in our town last week
of our old friend General Thomas J. Whar
ton, as a prosecuting counsel in the caxe
against Holinan of Sunflower county, for
killing Colonel Lowry and Mr. Arnold last
spriDg, reminds us of the first (and this is
the second) case in which we ever knew
him to appear against a man charged with
s capital crime. The cbro to whicn we al
lude ocenred m 1836, or thereabouts, in

then an unknown young lawyer, had jnst
moved to the town and began to practice.
when a killing occurred that shook the whole
community. '1 be slayer was rich ana in
flnential the slaughtered man was poor
but a universal favorite, and the excite
ment was intense. The rich man employed
the best counsel in the county one of
whom was General Foote, the must success
ful criminal lawyer then in the 8Ute. The
poor man's friends made a parse and offer
ed it to yonng Wharton to prosecute the
case. He refused, kindly but firmly told
them be appreciated the compliment, ana
in any other ease would be happy ot sn op
portunity to bring himself so prominently

justified iu reversing for this alone; but
we have carefully considered the objection,
and are of opinion that one-half that
amount would have been a liberal allow
ance for the service of stating the account,
the Commissioner having received the reg
ular fees for taking depositions. Whilst it
is proper that officers of court discharging
duties of this kind under the special direc
tion of the court should reoeive a fair com
pensation for their work, yet it should be
borne in mind that in the allowanoe for
such services, there is no plea for liberality
or generosity. Suitors in conrt are taxed
high enongh when they are oharged with
the statutory fees ; or in oases like this,
where they are made to pay the fair and
reasonable value of the work done.
Decree reversed.

Error to the Chancery Court of Winston
oounty, Hon. L. Brame, Chancellor.
The final decree of the Chancery Cour t
confirmed the retsatement of the fiual ac
count of plaintiff in error, as reported by
the Clerk to whom, as Commissioner, it
was referred, and directed distribution of
the balance found due the estate, among
the defendants in error, as distributees.
No exceptions were taken to the report of
the Commissioner.

1. No exceptions to the report of the
tUerk and Commissioner having been filed
in the Court below, we are precluded by
the repeated decisions of this Court from
passing upon the eonoluaions of facts ar
rived at by faun and sanotioned and con
firmed by the decree of the Chaneelor.
2. The rule applies as well in Probate as
in equity proceedings.
Decree affirmed.
Chattanooga. Tenn., Nov. 29. Further
investigation indicates that Jackson, the
body-snatcher; arrested here yesterday, has
been enaacred in the business for some
time. Books in his office show that Jack
son shipped a similar box to Wm. Moralk,
Cinoinati on the 24th January last; Feb-
uary 1st one box to J. W. Waxtoii, Cincin
nati; again to the latter address Febuary
4th, March 4th and 10th, April 3rd and 4th,
No further shipments were made until
October when four were shipped. During
November three boxes had already been
ahioDed to J. W. Williams, Atlanta, the
last box having been shipped November
25. This box is supposed to have contain
ed the bodv of a nearo woman who died
Sunday. In Jackson's pocket was found
receipts signed by J. W. Williams, Atlanta,
ackuowledeme the receipt of the bddy that
was shipped Monday, and for which $25 was
returned. Jackson is well known and was
a candidate for Alderman at the last elec
tion. Newton Carroll, the Sexton, is a
nearo. and has been employed at the come-
tary for the past three years- His brother
and his assistant have escaped, but the
police are on the truck.

In this case the Court is ssked to review

of the Court held that under the provisions
of the Code of 1871, the widow of a person
dying intestste and without children or de
scendants of them, was entitled to one-half
only of the estate of her deceased husband.
