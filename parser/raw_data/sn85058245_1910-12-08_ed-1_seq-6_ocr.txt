SYNOPSIS
I
Thomns Ardmore and Henry Maine
I GrlHuold stumble upon Intrigue when the
Rnxcrnnrs of North and South Carolina i
arc reported 1 to have quarreled Both
states are In a turmoil over one Apple
weight nn outlaw with political Influence
Hrlswnld allies himself with Barbara Os
borne daughter of the governor of South
Carolina while Ardmore espouses the
cause of Jerry Dan erlleld daughter of
he governor of North Carolina These
two Indies are trying to fill the shoes of
their fathers whllo the latter are miss
ing Unaware of each others position
both Orlswold and Ardmore set out to
mako the other prosecute Ardmore or
ganizes a big hunt Orlswolds men cap
tuie Applowelght Jerry Dnncerlleld discover
Allrlewehht
covers the captive and lends him to Ards
ley her own prisoner drlswold and Bar
bara explore the eceno of the disappear
ance and meet Ardmore and Jerry Grill
wold refuses to recognize hIs friend
CHAPTER XIVContlnued
Grlswolds companion spoke to him
earnestly In a low tone for a moment
and then GrIswold addressed Ardmore
incisively
I dont know what you pretend to
be sir but it may Interest you to
know that I am tho governor of South
Carolina I
And this gentleman cried Jerry
pointing to Ardmoro with her riding
crop though his hair is mussed and
hIs scarf visibly untied is none other
than tho governor of North Carolina
and ho is not only on his own proper
ty but In tho sovereign state ot which
he Is the chief executive
Prof Griswold lifted his hat with
tho least flourish
I congratulate tho state of North
Carolina on having reposed authority
In hands so capable If this young lady
Is correct sir I will serve official no
tice on you that I have reason to be
lieve that a person named Apple
weight a fugitive from justice is
hiding on your property and In your
state and I now formally demand that
you surrender him forthwith
If I may Introduce myself inter
posed Jerry I will say to you that
my name Is Geraldine Dangerfield
and that this Applewolght person Is
now at Mr Ardmores house
I suppose replied Miss Osborne
with gentlo Irony that ho has tho
pink parlor and leads tho conversa
tion at table
You aro quite mistaken replied
Ardmoro but If It would afford you
any satisfaction to see tho outlaw you
may look upon him In my wIno cellar
where only an hour ago I left him sit
ting on a case of Chateau Bizet 82
My further Intentions touching this
scoundrelly South Carolinian I need
not now disclose but I give you warn
ing that the Applowelght Issue will
soon and forever bo terminated and In
a manner that will greatly redound to
tho credit and the glory of the Old
I North State
I trust said Grlswold that tho
prisoner whom wo cannot for a mo
ment concede to be tho real Apple
weight will not be exposed to scarlet
fever pending a settlement of this
matter And now I havo tho honor
to bid you both good morning
He and Barbara swung their horses
round and retraced their way leav
ing Ardmore and Jerry gazing after
them
When the shabby beasts from the
stable at Turner Court House had
borne Miss Osborne and GrIswold out
of sight beyond the bungalow Ard
moro turned blankly to Jerry
Havo I gone blind or anything
Unless Im crazy that was dear old
Grlssy but who is that girl
That Is Miss Barbara Osborne and
I hopo she has learned such a lesson
that she will not be snippy to mo any
more If she Is the president general
of the Daughters of the Seminole
War
WarBut
But where do you suppose she
found Grlssy
I dont know Im sure nor Mr
Ardmore do I caro
Ho said ho represented the stato
of South Carolina do you suppose
the governor has really employed
him
I do not said Jerry emphatically
for he appears intelligent and Intel
llgenco is something that would never
appeal to Gov Osborne It Is quite
possible mused Jerry aloud that
Miss Osbornos father has disappeared
like mine and she is running his of
fice with Mr Groswolds aid It so
we shall probably havo some fun be
fore wo get through with this
If thats truo wo shall havo more
than fun exclaimed Ardmore thor
oughly aroused You dont know
Grlssy HOB the smartest man alive
and it hos running this Applowelgh
case for Gov Osborne hell keep us
guessing
I wish you to remember Mr Ard
more that you still have your oppor
tunity and that I expect you to carry
this matter through to a safe conclu
I slon nnd to tho honor of tho Old North I
Slate
I Imvo no intention of falling Miss
Dangcrflcld and with this they
turned and rode slowly back toward
the house
Prof Griswold and Miss Osborno
were flllciit until tho forest again shut
hem In
Then in a sequestered spot Qrls
wold suddenly throw up his head and
laughed long nnd loud
Do you suppose they really have
Applewelght asked Barbara
Not for a minute They told ua
that story merely to annoy us when
hey found what wo wero looking for
That touch about tho wino cellar is
characteristically Ardmoresquo If
they had Applewelght you may bo
sure they wouldnt keep him on the
premises
Whereupon they rodo back to Tur
ner Court House much faster than
they had come
CHAPTER XV
The Prisoner In the CornCrib
Jerry and Ardmore sat at a long
table In the commodious Ardsloy 11
brary which was a modification of a
Gothic chapel A large accumulation
of mall from the governors office at
Raleigh had been forwarded and Jer
ry insisted that It must be opened and
disposed of In some way Gov Dan
gerfield was It appeared a subscriber
to a clipping bureau and they had
been examining critically a batch of
cuttings relating to tho Now Orleans
incident
Its a good thing wo got hold of
Collins observed Ardmoro putting
down a clipping from a Now York
paper In which the reports of Gov
Dangerfields disappearance were ana
lyzed and tersely dismissed for he
knows how to write and hos done
a splendid picture of your father on
his throne attending to business and
his little stingers for Oitborno are the
work of a genius
Theres a certain finish about Mr
Collins lying that Is refreshing re
plied Jerry and I cannot help think
ing that he has a brilliant future be
fore him it ho enters politics Noth
ing pains me moro than a careless
considered silly lie which Is tho
best that most people can do But It
would be very Interesting to know
whether Gov Osborno has really dis
appeared or just how your friend the
Virginia professor has seized tho
reins of state Do you suppose ho got
a jug from somewhere and met Miss
Osborne and
Do you think do you think Bho
may havccr possIblyclosed ono
eyo In his direction asked Ardmore
dubiously
Mr Ardmore and Jerry pointed
at him with a bronze papercutter to
make sure ot his attention = Mr Ard
more It you ever Imply again by act
word or deed that I winked at you I
suall never never speak to you again
I should think that a man with a nice
sister like Mrs Atchison would have
a better opinion of women than you
seem to have I never saw you until
you came to my fathers house to tell
me about the jugand you know I
didnt And as for that Barbara Os

Do You Suppose They Really Have
Applewelght
borne while I dont doubt that oven
in South Carolina a Daughter ot the
Seminole War might wink at a gen
tleman In a moment of extreme provo
cation I doubt If she did for she lacks
animation and has no moro soul than
a gum overshoe
Tho discussion ceased abruptly on
tho appearance of Dig Paul tho for
ester
A body of South Carolina militia
Is marching across country from the
south One of my men heard of it
down at Turner Court House last
night and rode to where tho troops
were encamped Ho learned that it
was a practice march for the militia
Theres several companies of Infantry
so ho reports and a piece of artillery
Bully bar old Grissy exclaimed
Ardmore Theyre coming this way
are they Paul And tho three bent
over tho map
This Is the place sir They seem
to be planning to get around Turners
without stirring up the town But it
would take a good deal to wake up
Turners laughed the big German
Jerry placed her finger on tho state
line
If they dare cross thntIf they as
much as dare
If they dare wo shall show them
a tow things Take all the men you
need Paul to watch their movements
That will do
The forester lingered
You remember that we spoke the
other day of the log housQ on Rac
coon creek where tho Appfewelghts
had driven oft our man
Yes Paul It Is whero tho stato
lino crosses the heavy woods and tho
farthest outpost BO to speak on my
property Also you said Homo ot
these Applewelght fellows had been
cutting oft tho timber down there II 1
I remember rightly
Yes sir replied too forestor
twirling his cup awkwardly But
somo of tho people on the estate have
said
saidHo broke off In an embarrassment
so unlike him thnt Jerry and Ardmore
looked at him curiously
Well Paul whats the matter It
the cabin has bran burned down Its
no serious matter
Why sir some of tho men passing
there at night Ray they seo lights and
hear sounds In the cabin though no
one from the estate goes there A
child died in the house last spring
andwell you know how somo of
theso people are I
Cheer up Paul We have bigger
business on hand than the chasing of
ghosts Just now When wo got
through with these other things Ill
go over there myself and take a look
at the spook
As Paul hurried away Jerry seized
a pen and wrote this message
Rutherford Gllllngwntcr
AdjutantGeneral Camp Dangerfleld
Azbell N C
Move all available troops by shortest
route to Klldorp at once and report to
me personally at Ardsley lake no state
ments to newspapers Answer
DANOERFIELD
Governor
I guess that will bring him run
ning said Ardmore calling a serv
ant and ordering tho message dis
patched Immediately
Before luncheon a message was re
ceived from Glllingwater to this ef
fect
Gov William Dangerfleld
Ardsloy N C
En route with our entire available force
Un the field I am riding ahead with all
speed and will report at Ardsley at nine
oclock Is full military dress de rlgucur
Gllllngwater
AdjutantGeneral
Isnt that Just like Rutherford I
Hes afraid he wont bo dressy enough
but if he knew that the South Carolina
troops might shoot holes In his uni
form ho wouldnt be duo here for a
couple of weeks instead of at nine
oclock and Jerry laughed merrily
They debated more seriously this
telegram from Collins at Raleigh sent
the previous evening
Cant maintain this bluff much longer
Even the friendly newspapers are grow
ing suspicious State credit jeopardized
by disappearance of Treasurer Foster
Billings of Bronx Loan and Trust here
In a great fury over bond matter Do
you know governors whereabouts
Things are certainly growing more
exciting was Ardmores comment I
suppose even a gifted liar like Col
lins cant muzzle the press forever
You cant go on fooling all North
Carolina all the time either said
Jerry and I suppose when papa gets
tired of being scared ho will turn up
In Raleigh und tell some plausible
story about where he has been and
what has happened When it comes
to being plausible no one can tduch
papaMaybe
Maybe hes dead suggested Ard
more gloomily
Thats a real Inspiration on your
part Mr Ardmore and its very
sweet of you to mention It but I
have no idea that any harm has come
to papa Its too much trouble to get
I elected governor without dying in
office and besides papa is none too
friendly with the lieutenant governor
and would never think of allowing
such a person to succeed him But
those bonds seem rather serious and
I dont like the idea of your Mr Bill I
Ings making a fuss at Raleigh I I
That will bo all right remarked
Ardmore blotting the last of a num
ber of telegrams which he had been I
writing and pressing a button Its
much more Important for us to get
Applewelght Into a South Carolina
jail and Its not going to be so easy
to do now that Grlssy Is working on
tho other side and angry at me about
thnt scarlet fever telegram
There may bo trouble said Ard1 I
more n to his guests as they sat at
luncheon But I should bate to havo
it said that my guests could not be
taken care of here perfectly I beg
that you will all remain
Tho luncheon was Interrupted by
tho arrival of a summons for Ard
more who hurriedly left the table
Big Paul awaited him below mount
ed and holding a ledhorse
TO BE CONTINUED
King Granary
The Crimea and tho whole Black
sea region owing to the sparse popu
lation to consume It had a great sur
plus of wheat For centuries It was
coveted by all hungry nationsand
exploited by the ono with tho strong
est armies For centuries after Athens
had feasted upon the graln raising
lands beyond the Bosphorus Mlthrl
dates as a preparation for his life and
death contest with Rome fell upon
tho corn fields of the Crimea Because
Sicily was yellow with wheat from
earliest memory through ages and
ages she was raided by all the powers
ot the world It was because ot
Egypts corn moro plentiful than any
where else along tho Mediterranean
that Caesar and Pompoy wanted the
land of the Ptolemies It was when
Rome held or controlled the granaries
her first and dearest conquests of
Sicily Sardinia Spain and Egypt that
she could become mistress ot the
world

Little to Say About Tariff
Washington Dec Economy In
government affairs Is tho keynote of
President Tafts annual message read
before both houses of congress today
The message approximates 40000
words and Is ono of the longest ever
submitted by a president
Conservation of tho public domain
ship subsidy fortification of tho Pana
ma canal and the continuation of the
present tariff bard are the leading
subjects touched upon He also re
views the work of the various gov
ernment departments and concurs In
recommendation tending toward the
bettering of tho service made by sev
eral of tho members of his cabinet
Economy Is Urged
In dwelling on the urgent need for
economy In government expenditures the
president says Every effort has been
made by each department chief to reduce
the estimated cost of his department for
the ensuing fiscal year ending June 30
1912 I say this In order that congress
may understand that these estimates thus
made present the smallest sum which will
maintain the departments bureaus and
oflic03 of the government and meet Its
other obligations under existing law and
that a cut of these estimates would re
sult In embarrassing the executive branch
of the government In the performance of
its duties This remark does not apply
to the river and harbor estimates except
to those for expenses of maintenance and
the meeting of obligations under author
Ized contracts nor does It apply to the
public building bill nor to the navy build
ing program Of course as to these con
gress could withhold any part or all of
the estimates for them without Interfer
ing with the discharge of the ordinary ob
ligations of these functions of Its depart
ments bureaus and offices
Against the estimates of expenditures
J6 < 0 401312 we have estimated receipts
for next year 680000000 making a proba
ble surplus of ordinary receipts over or
dinary expenditures of about 50000000 or
taking Into account the estimates for the
Panama canal which are 5692084769 and
which will ulthnatelY be paid In bonds
It will leave a deficit for the next year of
about 7000000 If congress shall conclude
to fortify the canal
wants Forest Limitation Removed
On the subject of conservation he de
votes considerable space to forest coal
oil and gas phosphate lands and water
power sites As to the reservation of
forest lands he nays The law now pro
hibits the reservation of any more forest
lands In Oregon Washington Idaho
Montana Colorado and Wyoming except
by pct of congress I am Informed by the
department of agriculture that the gov
ernment owns other tracts of timber land
In these states which should be Included
In the forest reserves I recommend to
congress that the limitation herein Im
posed be repealed
Congress ought to trust the executive
to use the power bf reservation only with
respect to land most valuable for forest
purposes During the present administra
tion 62150000 acres of land largely non
timbered have been excluded from forest
reserves and 3500000 acres of land prln
clpally valuable for forest purposes have
been Included In forest reserves making
a reduction In forest reserves of non
timbered land amounting to 2750000
acres
Wants Canal Fortified
Regarding the Panama canal the presi
dent asserts that unless unexpected ob
stacles arise the waterway will be com
pleted well within time limit of Janu
arv 1 1915 and within estimate of cost
375000 < XX Suggestions for levying of
tolls and management are made and re
garding fortification of the canal he
laysAmong
Among questions arising for present
solution Is the decision whether the canal
hall be fortified I have already stated
to the congress that I strongly favor for
tification and I now reiterate this opin
ion and ask your consideration of the
subject In the light of the report already
before you made by a competent board
Failure to fortify the canal would
leave the attainment of both these alms
in the position of rights and obligations
whch we should be powerless to enforce
nnd which could never In any way be ab
solutely safeguarded against a desperate
and Irresponsible enemy
Ship Subsidy
The president urges such action as ho
believes will Increase American trade
abroad and says
Another Instrumentality Indispensable
to the unhampered and natural develop
ment of American commerce Is merchant
marine All maritime and commercial
na
tions recognize the Importance of this
factor The greatest commercial nations
our competitors jealously foster their
merchant marine Perhaps nowhere Is
the need for rapid and direct mall pas
senger and freight communication quite
BO urgent as between the United States
and Latin America We
can secure In no
other quarter of the world such Imme
diate benefits In friendship and c ml
Jnerca as would flow from the establlsh
ment ot direct lines of communication
with the countrIes ot Latin America ade
quate to meet tho requirements of
a rap
Idly Increasing appreciation of the reel
procal dependence of tho countries of the
western hemisphere upon each others
products sympathies and assistance
I I alluded to this most important sub
Ject In my last annual message It has
often been before you and I need not
re
capitulate the reasons for Its recommen
datlon Unless prompt action be taken

Criticism ot the Tariff
In the space devoted to the tariff the
president Bays
The schedules of the rates of duty In
the Payne tariff act have been PU > ctod
to a great deal ot criticism some of It
just more of It unfounded nnd too touch
mlsreprcacnlntlon The act was n > iptcd
In pursuance of a declaration by the par
ty which Is responsible for It that cus
toms bill should be a tariff for the pro
tcctlon of home Industries tho measure
of the protection to be the difference be
tween the cost of producing the Imported
article abroad and the cost of producing
It at home together with such addition to
that difference as might give a reasonable
profit to the home producer The basis
for the criticism of this tariff Is that In
respect to a number of the schedules fho
declared measure was not followed but n
higher difference retained or Inserted by
way of undue discrimination In favor of
certain Industries and manufactures LIt
tie If any of tho criticism of the tariff
has been directed against the protective
principle above stated but tho main body
of the criticism has been based on the at
tempt to conform to the measure or pro
tection was not honestly and sincerely
adhered to
The president also refers to the appoint
ment of a board of experts to investigate
the cost of production of various articles
Included In tho schedules of the tariff
and concludes
Whether or not the protective policy U
to be continued and the degree of protec
tion to he accorded to our home Indus
tries are questions which the people must
decide through their chosen representa
tives But whatever policy Is adopted It
Is clear that the necessary legislation
should bo based on an Impartial thor
ough and continuous study of the facts
Recommends Parcels Post
The adoption of the parcels post Is
again adopted On this subject President
Taft says With respect to the parcels
post I respectfully recommend Its ndnp
tlon on all rural delivery routes and that
11 poundsthe International limit ba
made the limit of carriage In such post
The same argument Is made against the
parcels post that was made against the
postal savings bankthat It Is Introduc
ing the government Into a business which
should be conducted by private persons
and Is paternalism The postofllcc depart
ment has a great plant and a great or
ganization reaching Into the most remou
hamlet of the United States and with
this machinery It Is able to do a great
many things economically that If a new
organization were necessary It would ba
Impossible to do without extravagant ex
penditures
Department of Justice
Discussing the affairs of the department
of justice the president says
I Invite especial attention to the prose
cutions under the federal law of the so
called bucket shops and of those
schemes to defraud In which the use of
the mall Is an essential part of the
fraudulent conspiracy prosecutions which
have saved Ignorant and weak members
of the public and are saving them hun
dreds of millions of dollars The viola
tions of the antitrust law present per
haps the most Important litigation before
the department and the number of cases
filed shows the activity of the govern
ment In enforcing that statute
In a special message last year I
brought to the attention of congress the
propriety and wisdom of enacting a gen
eral law providing for the Incorporation
of Industrial and other companies engaged
In Interstate commerce and I renew my
recommendation In that behalf
The crying need In the United States
of cheapening the cost of litigation by
simplifying Judicial procedure and ex
pediting final judgment Is pointed out and
action looking to correction of these evils
Is urged
The president recommends an increase
In the salaries of federal judges
Postal Affairs
In regard to postal matters the presi
dent points with pride to Its present effi
cient management and the recent reduc
tion In the deficit The present unre
stricted franking privilege comes In for
comment with a suggestion for the adop
tion of better methods for Its regulation
Abolish Navy Yards
The president calls attention to certain I
reforms urged by the secretary of the
navy which he recommends for adoption
and continues
The secretary of the navy has given
personal examination to every navy yard t
and has studied the uses of the navy
yards with reference to the necessities
of our fleet With a fleet considerably
legs than half the size of that of the
British navy we have shipyards mora 1
than double the number and there are I
several of these shipyards expensively
pnnlpped with modern mchlnery which
after Investigation the secretary of the +
navy believes to bo entirely useless for e
naval purposes Ho asks authority to
abandon certain of them and to move
their machinery to other places where It t
can be made of use
Speaking of our foreign relations the
president says During the past year
the foreign relations of the United Stales
have continued upon a basis of friendship
and good understanding
The year has been notable as witness
Ing the pacific settlement of two Impor
tant International controversies before the
permanent court of Tho Hague f
The arbitration of the fisheries dispute
between the United States and Great
Britain which has been the source of
nearly continuous diplomatic correspond
ence since tho fisheries convention of 1S18 I
has given an award which Is satisfactory
J
to both parties This arbitration Is par
ticularly noteworthy not only because of
the eminently just results secured but
also because It Is the first arbitration held
under the general arbitration treaty of
April 4 190S between the United State
and Great Britain and disposes of a con
troversy the settlement of which has re
sisted every other resource of diplomacy
and which for nearly ninety years has
I been the cause of friction between two
I countries whose common Interest lies In
maintaining the most friendly and cordial
relations with each other
I President Taft makes a few recommen
dations for changes In the Interstate com
I merce law and says
Except as above I do not recommend
any amendment to the Interstate com
merce law as It stands I do not now
recommend any amendment to the anti
trust law In other words It seems to
me that the existing legislation with
reference to the regulation of corpora
tions and the restraint of their business
has reached a point where we can stop
for a while and witness the effect of the
vigorous execution of the laws of the
statute books In restraining the abuses
which certainly did exist and which
roused the public to demand reform
