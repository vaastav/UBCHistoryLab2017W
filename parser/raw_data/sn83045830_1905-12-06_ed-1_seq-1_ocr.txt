President Endorses Exposition
I again heartily commend to your favorable consid?
eration the tercentennial celebration of the suit lenient
at Jamestown, Virginia. Appreciating the desirability
of this commemoration, the'-Congress passed an :?.?*.
March 3, 1905, authorizing in the year 1907, on ami
near the waters of Hamptoti Roads, in the State ot
Virginia, an international naval, marine, and military
celebration in honor of this event. i5y the authority
vested iti me by this act; I have made proclamation
of said celebration, and have issued, iu conformity
with its instructions, invitations to all the nation-; of
the earth to participate, by sending their naval vessels
and such military organizations as may lie practicable.
This celebration would fail of its full purpose unless it
were enduring in its results and commensurate with
the importance of the event to be celebrated, the event
from which our nation dalt s its birth. I earnestly hope
that this celebration, already indorsed-by the Congress
of the United States, and by the Legislatures of six
teen States since the action of the Congress, will re?
ceive such additional aid al your hands as will make it
worthy of the great event it is intended to celebrate,
and thereby enable the government of the United
States to make provision for the exhibition of its own
resources;' and likewise enable our people who have
undertaken the work or" such a celebration to provide
suitable and proper entertainment and instruction in
the historic even;.-, of our country for all who may
visit the exposition and to whom we have tendered our
hospitality.
fls to Merchant Manne
To t.i,e spread of o>:r trade in peace and the defense
of our flag in war a great and prosperous merchant
marine is indispensable. We should have ships of our
>wn and seamen of our own to convey our goods to
neutral markets, and in case of need to reenforce our
battle line. It can not but be a source of regret and
uneasiness to us that the lines of communication with
our sister republics of South America should be chiefly
under foreign control. It is not a good thing that
American merchants and manufacturers should have
to send their goods and letters to South Ann rion via
Europe if they wish security and dispatch. Even oh
the Pacific, where our ships have held theirown bettei
than on the Atlantic, our merchant flag i-. now threat?
ened through the liberal aid bestowed by other govern ?
ments on t heir own si cam lilies. 1 ?k your earnest
consideration of the report with which the Merchant
Marine Commission has followed its long r.rul careful
inquiry.
