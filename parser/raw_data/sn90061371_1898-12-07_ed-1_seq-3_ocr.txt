Digest of the Annual Message of
President McKinley to the Con
gress of the United States.
LARGELY A REVIEW OF THE RECENT WAR.
The President lias Only Words of Praise
for Those Who Brought the War to a
Succensf ul Conclusion, aud Looks For
ward Coiilicntly to the Conclusion of an
Honorable Treaty of Peace with Spain.
Washington, Dec. S. President Mc
Kin Ivy's second annual message, sub
mitted to congress, contains about 20,
000 words. Following is a brief synop
sis inchidiii"; some direct excerpts of
the more important features of the
message:
TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OP
KKPUICSENATIVKS: Nothwlthstandlng
the ail'Je burdens rendered necessary by
the war, our people rejoice in a very sat
isfactory and steadily-Increasing degree
of prosperity evidenced by the largest
volume of business ever recorded. Manu
factures have been productive, agricul
tural pursuits have yieiued abundant re
turns, labor in all iields of industry is
better rewarded, revenue legislation
passed by the present congress has in
creased the treasury's receipts to the
amount estimated bv Its authors: the
finances of the government have been suc
cessfully administered and Its credit ad
vanced to the first rank: while its cur
rency has been maintained at the world's
highest standard. Military service under
a common flag and for a righteous cause
has strengthened the national spirit, and
served to cement more closely than ever
the fraternal bonds between every sec
tion 01 tne country.
CONTKOVKRSY WITH SPAIN RE
VIEWED.
In reviewing the controversy which led
tip to the war with Spain, the president
takes up the thread or narrative where
it terminated in his last annual mes
sage, lie concluded: "it was honestly
due to our friendly relations with Spain
that she should be given a reasonable
chance to realize her expectations of re
form to which she had become irrevoca
bly committed.
It became evident, however, that the
proposed plans were barren of gofld re
sults. No tangible relief was afforded the
reooneemrados, among whom the rate
of mortality frightfully increased; the
proffered expedient of zones of cultiva
tion proved illusory, and it was apparent
that nothing save the physical exhaus
tion of Spalii or the Cubans and the prac
tical ruin of the island of Cuba could re
sult Irom the struggle then in progress.
DESTRUCTION' OP THE MAINE.
At this critical juncture the destruo-
Tlon ot the battleship ' Maine occurred.
Concerning it the president savs:
"It is a striking evidence of the poise
and sturdy good sense u.stinguishing our
national character that this shocking
blow, falling upon a generous people, al
ready deeply touched by preceding events
in t:uuu, out not move tnem to an in
stant, desperate resolve to tolerate no
longer the existence of a condition ol
danger and disorder at our doors that
made possille such a deed, by whomso
ever wrought."
Resuming the war narrative, the presi
dent directs attention to the measures,
Including the $50,tJO,w0 appropriation for
luitional defense, taken to place the
country on a war footing, and adds: "It
is sutlicient to say that the outbreak of
war, when it did come, found our nation
not unprepared to meet the conflict. "
APPREHENSION BY EUROPEAN
POWERS.
Reference is made to the apprehension
ot coming utruo by trie continental pow
ers, voiced in the address to the presi
dent through their ambassadors and en
voys, and to the president's renlv thereto
Still animated, however, by the hope of
a peaceful solution of the dillleulty, and
obeying the dictate's of duty, tue presi
dent relaxed no effort to bring about a
speedy ending of the Cuban struggle. Ne
gotiations with the Madrid government
proved futile, so far as practical results
were concerned, ana tnen il was tne
president presented the ouestlon to con-
press, spying: "In the name of humanity,
in the name of civilization, in behalf of
endangered American interests, which
give us the right and duty to speak and
to act, the war in Cuba must stop.''
THE DECLARATION OF CONCRKSS.
The result of this statement of the case
was tne adoption of the memorable joint
resolution by congress, declaring the pur
pose of the I'ni'ted States to intervene
between the Spaniards and Cuban, fol
lowing swiftly upon the enactment of the
resolution, came the soverenee of diplo
matic relations between the two coun
tries, the proclamation of a blockade of
Cuban ports, the call Tor volunteers, and
the formal declaration of the existence
of a state of war. All other governments
were immediately notified of the exist
ence of war and each proclaimed neu
trality. "It is not among the least grati
fying incidents of the struggle that the
obligations of neutrality were impartially
discharged by all, often under delicate
and difficult circumstances."
THE PREPARATION FOR WAR.
The president reviews at length the
work of preparation for war, referring
particularly to the enlistment of the vol
unteers, to the material increase of the
navy in both men ami ships, and to the
precautionary measures taken for the
protection of the seaboard coast and
cities. "The aggregate number of mines
placed was 1,535, at the principal harbors
from Maine to California."
Referring to "the difficult and im
portant character" of the work per
formed by the' signal corps the president
says: "This service was invaluable to the
executive in directing the operations of
the army and navy. With a total force
of over 1,800, the loss was by disease, in
camp and held, officers and men included,
only live."
' As to the authorized loan of $2rtO,000,000,
which was taken entirely by small bid
ders, the president says: "This was a
most encouraging and significant result,
showing the vast resources of the nation
and the determination of the people to
uphold their country's honor."
Takimr im chronoiocrh-all v the events of
the war. the president, reviews them care-
luily. The hrst encounter was Ihe shell
ing of Mrttanzas on April 27. This was
followed by an engagement which was
"Destined to mark a memorable epoch in
maritime v.nrfare."
DEWEY'S WONDERFUL VICTORY.
This was Commodore Dewey's wonder
ful victory at Manila, on May 1. "The ef
fect of this remarkable victory" says the
president, "upon the spirit of our people
and upon the fortunes of the war was in
stant. A prestige of invincibility thereby
attached to our arms, which continued
throughout the struggle."
The president says that. "Only reluc
. tance to cause needless loss of life and
property prevented the early storming
and capture of the city (Manila), and
therewith the absolute military occupan
cy of the whole group." Following the
memorable trip of the battleship Oregon
from San Francisco to Key West, and the
tiombaidment of Pan Juan and the forts
of Santiago, to which special reference la
made, the president says:
LI3UT. HOBSON S EXPLOIT.
"The next act In the war thrilled not
alone the hearts of our countrymen, but
the world, by its exceptional heroism. On
the night of June 3 Lieut. Hobson, aided
bv seven volunteers, blocked the outlet
from Santiago harbor by sinking the
collier Merrimae In the channel, under a
fierce fire from the shore batteries, escap
ing with their lives as by a miracle, but
falling Into the hands of the Spaniards.
It Is a most gratifying Incident of the war
that the bravery of this little band of he
roes was cordially appreciated by the
Spanish admiral."
THE SANTIAGO CAMPAIGN.
The campaign of Santiago, resulting
In the Investment and capture of that
city, is referred to as a brilliant achieve
ment. A brief review is then presented
of the decisive naval combat of the war
on July 3, resulting In the complete de
struction of Admiral Crevera's Meet. Con
cerning it the president says: "Where all
bo conspicuously distinguished them
selves, from the commanders to the gun
ners, and the unnamed heroes In the
boiler rooms, each and all contributing
towards the achievement of this astound
ing victory, for which neither ancient nor
modern history affords a parallel In the
completeness of the event, and the mar
velous disproportion of casualties, it
would be Invidious to single out any one
tor special honor."
PRAISE FOR OUR SHIPBUILDERS.
. In this connection the president says:
Nor can we be unmindful of the achieve
ments of our builders, mechanics and ar
'tisans for their part In the construction
pf our warships. ...
TEARS FOR THE DEAD.
As to the success gained by the arms
Of the United States in Cuba, the presi
dent gays that the earnest and lasting
:. gratitude of the nation Is unsparingly
due. "Not should we alone remember
the gallantry of the living, the dead claim
our tears, and our losses by battle, and
disease must cloud tiny exultation at the
irmit aijd tach us th awful cost of war.

wltn tne exception of the crew of the
Merrimae" not a soldier or sailor was
taken prisoner."
TRIBUTE TO THOSE WHO COULD
NOT GO.
The president bears testimony and pays
fitting tribute "to the patriotism and de
votion of that large portion of our army
which, although eager to be ordered to
the post ot greatest exposure, fortunate
ly were not required outside of the United
States." They did their whole duty and
earned the gratitude of the nation. The
president then says: "In tracing these
events we are constantly reminded of our
obligations to the Divine Master for His
watchful care over us, and His safe
guidance, for which the nation makes
reverent acknowledgment, and offers
humble prayer for the continuance of His
favors."
THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS.
The peace negotlatons, which followed
soon after the capitulation of Santiago,
and the preparation and signing of the
protocol, are discussed at length. Refer
ring to the work of the peace commis
sioners at Paris, the president savs:
"These negotiations have made hopeful
progress, so that I trust soon to be able
to lay a definite treaty before the senate,
with a review of the steps leading to its
signature."
GOVERNMENT OF OUR NEW POS
SESSIONS. "I do not discuss at this time the gov
ernment or tenure of the new possesions
which will come to us as a result of the
war with Spain. Such discussion will be
appropriate after the treaty of peace
shall be ratified. In the meantime, and
until the congress has legislated other
wise, it will be my duty to continue the
military governments which have existed
since our occupation, and to give to the
people security In life and property and
encouragement under a just and benefi
cent rule.
THE FUTURE OF CUBA.
"As soon as we are In possession of Cuba
and have pacified the island it will be
necessary to give aid and direction to its
people to form a government for them
selves. This should be undertaken at the
earliest moment consistent with safety
and assured success. It is im
portant that our relations with
this people shall be of the
most friendly character and our commer
cial relations close and reciprocal. It
should be our duty to assist in every
proper way to build up the waste places
of the island, encouraire the industrv of
the people, and assist them to form a
government which shall be free tml in
dependent, thus realizing the best aspira
tions or tne tuoan people.
A HUMANE GOVERNMENT.
"Spanish rule must be replaced by a
just, benevolent and humane govern
ment, created by the people of Cuba,
capable of performing all international
obligations, and which shall encourage
thrift, industry and prosperity, and pro
mote peace and good will among all of
the inhabitants, whatever may have been
their relations in the past. Neither re
venge nor passion should have a place in
the new government. Until there is
complete tranquillity in the island and a
stable government inaugurated military
occupation will be continued.
FRIENDLY' WITH ALL THE REST OF
THE WORLD.
The president says that with one ex
ception of the rupture with Spain, the
intercourse of the United States with
the great family of nations during the
past year has been marked with cordiali
ty. Concerning negotiations with the Ar
gentine government, initiated with a view
to removing differences in cable rate
charges imposed upon messages passing
from and to the United States, the presi
dent expresses ins sincere hope lor an in
ternational agreement whereby inter
change of messages over connecting lines
mav he regulated on a fair basis of uni
formity, aud adds: "It would be strange
were the nations not in time brought to
realize that modern civilization, which
owes so much of its progress to the an
nihilation of time by the electrical force.
demands that this all-important means of
communication be a heritage of all peo
ples, to be administered and regulated m
their common behalf."
A QUESTION WITH AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.
As to the killing and wounding of strik
ing miners in Luzerne county. Pa., which
aroused the solicitude ot the Austro-Hun
garian government, many of the miners
being subjects of that government, the
president expects to reach a haruoniou
understanding on the subject with Au
stria-Hungary.
The hope is expressed that the restric
tions imposed by Belgium on the Irauor
tation of American cattie will at an early
day be relaxed, so as to admit live Amcr
lean cattle under proper regulations.
THE NICARAGUA CANAL.
The president expects that the Nicara
gua canal commission will shortly be able
to report finally. "I have not hesitated
to express my convictions," says the pres
ident, "that considerations of expediency
and international policy as between the
several governments interested in the
construction and control ot an inter
oceanic canal by this route require the
maintenance of the status quo until the
canal commission shall have reported and
the United Stales congress shall have
had the opportunity to pass finally upon
tne whole matter."
The president regards, in view of our
newly-acquired interests in the Pacific
ocean, the construction of such a mari
time highway as now more than ever in
dispensable. EVENTS IN THE CHINESE EMPIRE.
Concerning the extraordinary events
transpiring in the Chinese empire, the
president says that our position among
nations gives the equitable claim to con
sideration and friendly treatment in this
regard, and that it will be his aim to
subserve our large interests in the orient
by all means appropriate to th e constant
policy of our government.
Reference is made to several claims of
citizens of the United States pending
against other nations and to the settle
ment of other claims during the past
y"ar' THE PARIS EXPOSITION.
After reviewing the work of the Paris
exposition commissioner, the president
recommends that the appropriation for
the exhibit of the United States at the
Paris exposition be increased to $1,009,-
ooo.
OUR RELATIONS WITH GREAT BRIT
A1N. Our relations with Great Britain have
continued on the most friendly footing,
and the president says it would give him
especial satisfaction if he should be au
thorized to communicate to congress a
favorable conclusion of the pending nego
tiations with Great Britain in respect to
the Dominion of Canada.
The president reports that the Hawaiian
commission has fulfilled its mission, and
that its report will be laid before congress
at an early day. "It was believed that
their recommendations will have the
earnest consideration due to the magni
tude of responsibility resting upon you to
give such shape to the relationship of
these mid-Pacific lands to our home un
ion as will benefit both In the highest de
greee." THE CZAR'S PEACE PROPOSAL.
Referring to the proposal of the czar of
Russia for a general reduction o the
great military establishments, the presi
dent says: "His majesty was at once In
formed of the cordial sympathy involved
In his exalted proposal, and of the readi
ness of the United States to take part In
the conference."
The president says that the newly-accredited
envoy of the United States to
the Ottoman porte carries Instructions
looking to the disposal of matters in con
troversy with Turkey for a number of
years.
FINANCIAL AFFAIRS.
Alluding to the financial affairs of the
country, the president says In part: "The
secretary of the treasury reports that the
receipts of the government from all
sources during the fiscal year ended June
30, ISPS, including 104,751,223 received from
sale of Pacific railroads, amounted to
t405.32t.335, and Us expenditures to 43,
468.5S2. "It Is estimated upon the basis of pres
ent revenue laws that the receipts of the
government for the year ending June 30,
1899, will be $577,874,645, and its expendi
tures $SS3,S74,647, resulting In a deficiency
Of $112,000,000.
"In my judgment, the present condition
of the treasury amply justifies the im
mediate enactment of the legislation rec
ommended one year ago, under which a
portion of the gold holdings should be
placed In a trust fund, from which green
backs should be redeemd upon presenta
tion, but when once redeemed should not
thereafter be paid out except for gold.
It Is not to be Inferred that other legis
lation relating to our currency Is not re
quired; on tht contrary, there oh
v'oua demand toe a."
COMMUNICATION WITH ACQUIRED
The president says that in view of the
recent acciuisltinn of territory bv the
United States, there should be established
regular and frequent steamship communi
cation, under the American flag, with the
newiy-acquired islands.
THE YELLOW FEVER PROBLEM.
In view. also, of the increased imDor-
tance of the proposed formation of a
commission of sanitary experts to inves-;
ugaie tne yellow lever problem, owing
to the military occupation of Cuba, the
president recommends that congress pro-,
vide for such a commission. i
INCREASED REGULAR ARMY. I
The recommendation made bv the see-'
retary of war for the increase of the reg
ular military establishment has the presi
dent's unqualified approval. He says that
it is his purpose to muster out the entire
volunteer army as soon as congress shall
provide for the increase of the regular
establishment. He recommends the erec
tion of a building for the department of
justice, and suggests also the advisability
oi maxing suitaDie provision lor tne su
prem court.
SECRETARY LONG'S RECOMMENDA
TIONS APPROVED.
He earnestly approves of the recommen
dations of Secretary Long as to the in
crease of the navy, and recommends also
that the grades of admiral and vice-admiral
be temporarily revived, to be filled
by officers who have especially distin
guished themeselves in the war with
Spain.
The president earnestly urges early leg
islation for the taking of the twelfth
census, and legislation providing for the
education of the 30.0W white children in

ago the responsibility was duly
placed, but the people are now coming
to see, as fast as prejudice will allow,
that the grand moving cause of the

has had a comfortable time in this
land. Dr. De Costa, Episcopalian,

CHAPLAINS IN THE NAVY.
The Roafhdt Seanai Respects Ilia
Sblp'a "Sky Pilot" Hi grift Mas
on Hoard Ship.
The man-o'-war's man means no dis
respect when he refers to his ship's
chaplain as the "sky pilot." Bather it
U a term of approval. The bluejacket
at heart is perhaps the least sacrile
gious of uniformed men. Profane he
may be; the bluejacket's profanity is as
much a habit as his attendance at the
mess table, and it is innocuous and
meaningless. But nine out of ten Ameri
can man-o'-war's men have a con
temptuous word, and not infrequently
n hard fist, for the man-o'-war chaw"
(generally the ship's fool), who invites
suppression and a black eye by speaking
sneeringly of religion.
One of the first regulations of the
United States navy recommends, in ef
fect, that "officers and men shall when
ever possible participate in the worship
of Almighty God" aboard the ships.
While this regulation is not mandatory,
being simply inserted in the form of a
recommendation, officers and men are
much more sincere in their respect for
the observance of this clause, which is
read out on the quarter deck at every
monthly muster, together with a short
abstract of the navy regulations, than if
attendance on religious services aboard
ship were compulsory, as it is in several
of the w-orld's navies. While there are
chaplains in the United States navy
who are favorites among the men,
just as there are commanders of ships
for whom the men w;ould fight better
than for others, all of the "sky pilots"
pain and hold the respect and confidence
of the enlisted men. Capt. Chidwick,
of the Maine, was not- seeond even to
the gallant, cool-headed Capt. Sigsbee
in the affection in which he was held by
the crew of the doomed battleship.
Memorial services have been held in
churches of all denominations through
out the United States in honor of the
men who passed with the Maine, and
there have been many requiem masses
In the Roman Catholic churches for the
repose of the souls of the men who went
down in the battleship. But high mass
ashore and high mass afloat are two dif
ferent matters. The writer happened to
be present at the only high mass of the
Roman Catholic church that was ever
celebrated on an American man-of-war.
There are two Roman Catholic chap
lains in the Unite! States navy, and
each of them recites the low mass of his
creed aboard his vessel every Sunday
morning, as well as on the holy days of
obligation. These masses are in gen
eral pretty well attended by the enlist
ed men of all manners of religious be
lief, and the officers not infrequently
attend the masses in a body. But it was
on the United States cruiser Baltimore,
when that fine vessel was anchored in
the harbor of Honolulu in January,
1S96, that, the first high mass in the his
tory of the American navy was chanted.
The Baltimore, on her way from
China to the United States, with her
"homeward-bound" pennant streaming
200 feet in her wake, steamed into a ter
rible typhoon a few days after leaving
the coast of Japan, and, hove to and
wallowing in the thick of it for eight
days, came near foundering. When she
rounded Pearl Harbor point, on the
Island of Oahu, and crawled to her an
chorage in the harbor of Honolulu she
was a pretty rusty looking craft, with
her cutters stove in, her davits twisted
and torn off, her chain rails carried
away, and her fighting tops lowered to
the deck to prevent- excessive roll
ing. Officers and men were glad to
get into port, for their danger had been
most imminent. Two seamen had been
carried away by green seas that washed
the high-standing top-gallant fo'c'sle,
and there were a lot of broken heads,
ribs, legs and arms among the men for
ward. The shin's carpenter, a warrant
officer, died of his injuries the day the
Baltimore steamed into Honolulu har
bor, and was buried in the beautiful
Nuuanu valley of Honolulu, under the
shadow of the Punchbowl, with naval
honors.
The chaplain of the Baltimore was e
young Roman Catholic priest, a scholar,
an athlete, and a finished man generally,
born and educated in Maryland. He de
cided to have a high mass as a special
ceremony of thanksgiving on the Sun
day following the Baltimore's easting
her mudhook in the harbor of Honolu
lu. This was as impressive a religious
ceremony- as any ever seen or heard in
a great cathedral. It was celebrated on
the ship's wide and long berth-deck for
ward. The carpenter's gang built an
altar especially for the occasion. Some
of the men got shore liberty and gath
ered the gorgeous wild flowers that
bloom in the woodlands around Hono
lulu. Then they decorated the altar,
which, when its ornamentation was
tompleted, was a wonderful blaze o1
color. Two young apprentice boys
served as acolytes, habited in cassock
and surplices. The fact that- these two
chubby boys strove to be consistent and
emulative ruffians under the ordinary
conditions of man-o'-war life did not
, militate, in the minds of the uniformed
worshipers, against the impressiveness
of the mass which they served. Nor did
the rattling of the double irons of th?
half-dozen prisoners, confined up for
ward in the "brig," in full view of the
congregation, have any disconcerting
effect.
Nearly all the officers and men ol
the ship's company of four hundred and
odd crowded down the berth deck lad
ders to attend the mass. The mess
benches of the men were the seats. The
officers were in their full dress uni
forms and the men woretheir muster
tag clothes. N. Y. Post.
Salty Tante of Sea AVnter.
Sea water is brackish, first, because
the sea contains mines of salt at the
bottom of its bed; second, the water is
impregnated with bituminous matter
which is brackish, and, third, it con
tains many putrid substances of a
brackish nature. The reason why rain
water is not salty, although most of it
is evaporated from the sea, is explained
by the fact that salt will not evaporate,
and therefore when sea water is turned
into vapor its salt is left behind. Chi

A Race Asralast Fire.
After a ten days' fight to avoid death, the
crew of a steamer from Spain recently ar
rived in Baltimore. In mid ocean it was dis
covered that flames were raging in the ves
sel's hold. For ten long days the crew brave
ly fought the flames. If men would tight as
persistently against disorders of the stomach
and digestive organs, there would be fewer
premature deaths. The best weapon for such
a fight is Hostetter's Stomach Bitters. It is
the greatest of tonics, and the best of reme
dies for kidney, liver, bladder and blood dis
orders.

Deafness Cannot De Cured
by local applications, as they cannot reach
the diseased portion of the ear. There is
only one way to cure deafness, and that is
by constitutional remedies. Deafness is
caused by an inflamed condition of the mu
cous lining of the Eustachian Tube. When
this tube nets inflamed you have a rumbling
sound or imperfect hearing, and when it is
jntirely closed deafness is the result, and
unless the inflammation can be taken out
and this tube restored to its normal con
dition, hearing will be destroyed forever;
nine cases of of ten are caused by catarrh,
which is nothing but an inflamed condition
of the mucous surfaces.
We will give One Hundred Dollars for any
case of Deafness (caused bv catarrh that
cannot be cured hv Hall's Catarrh Cure.

AN AFFAIR NATION
It h&a been s&td of Americans tha.t they
are "a nation oF dyspeptics" and it is true
that few &rc entirely free from disorders
of the digestive tr&ct. Indigestion. Dyspepsia,,
Stomach and Bovicl trouble, or Constipation.
The treatment of these diseases
with cathartic medicines too. often .-
ravates the trouble.
THE LOGICAL TREATMENT
is the use of a remedy that wi build up
the system, thereby enabling the various
organs to act as Mature intended they should.
Such a remedy is found in Dr YMIiams' Pink
Pills for Pale People Mere is the proof
In Detroit there are few soldiers more popular snd efficient than Max
R. Davles, first sergeant of Co. B. His home is at 416 Third Avenue. For
four years he was a bookkeeper with the wholesale drug house of Farrand,
Williams & Clark, and he says: "I have charged up many thousand
orders for Dr. Williams Pink rills for Pale People, but never knew their
worth until I used them for the cure of chronic dyspepsia. For two yean
I suffered and doctored for that aggravating trouble but could only be
helped temporarily.
"I think dyspepsia is one of the most stubborn of ailments, and there
is scarcely a clerk or office man but what is more or less a victim. Some
days I could eat anything, while at other times I would be starving.
Those distressed pains would for-e me to quit work. I have tried many
treatments and remedies but they would help only for a time. A friend
induced me to try Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People, and after tak
ing a few doses I found much relief and after using several boxes I was
cured. I know these pills will cure dyspepsia of its worst form and I am
pleased to recommend them." Detroit Mick.) Journal.
