The Fkencii Si'OLiation Claims.?Sena
tor Cameron stated yesterday that it is his de
sigu to call up the French spoliations bill pend
ing in the Senate at the close of the last session,
at the first opportunity that he can get the floor
for that purpose. Both he and Seuator Yiek
ers had elaborate speeches prepared in favor of
the measure last spring, but in consequence of
the great press of business at that time, no oc
casion was afforded to deliver them. When
Mr. Cameron gets the bill up he will deliver
his speech, and will be followed by Mr. Yiek
ers, and Mr. Sumner will probably follow 31 r.
Yiekers. The bill only appropriates five mil
lion dollars, but it cannot pass without opposi
tion, as some prominent members of both
houses are known to be opposed to it. The ar
guments of President Pierce, when he vetoed
the bill passed during his administration, are
understood to have been mainly derived from a
speech in opposition to the bill delivered in the
House of Representatives by Seuator Thurman,
then a member of that body.
The Electorial Yote.?The Washington
correspondent of the Baltimore Sun of this
morning says : '"Telegrams were received here
last night,from leading democrats in New York
and elsewhere, suggesting to democratic mem
bers of Congress the propriety of holding a
consultation fur the purpose of determining the
advisability of recommending to the Greeley
presidential electors some suitable action, per
haps the casting of blauk votes. This sugges
tion met with little favor. There was some in
formal talk among democratic Seuators and
members to day on the subject, and the al
most general conclusion was the same as that
arrived at by the national executive committee,
that this was a subject which pertained exclu
sively to the electors themselves. A promiuent
Senator, however, remarked that he did not
see the least impropriety in the electors casting
their votes fjr Mr. Greeley, regardless of his
decease.
The Washington Chronicle says that * "there
is a pretty general inquiry whether Gov. Blair,
of Michigan, and General Farnsworth, of Illi
nois, both holding chairmanships of important
committees, will venture to follow the example
ot General Banks, and submit the question of
their eontiuuauce to a vote of the House. Some
are of the opinion that they will have to do so;
that it is demanded by un obvious personal
sense of honor. Others, however, conclude
that they will take shelter under the vote of
the House already recorded in the case of
General Banks, and insist that the principle
has been thus settled. We predict that neith
er of them will consent to occupy an equivocal
position,"
The Democratic National Committee of New
York held a meeting, on Monday, and an
nounced, through their Chairman, Mr. Augus
tus Schell, that they do not regard it as within
the scope of their delegated authority to ad
vise the electors of the States which favored
the election of the Baltimore candidates as to
the course they should pursue in view of the
death of Horace Greeley. The situation is a
novel one, and it is not deemed advisable to es
tablish a precedent in a oase for which future
National Conventions will probably provide.
The Daricn expedition sailed from Norfolk,
Monday, in the steamer Kansas. The instruc
tions of the expedition comprise the completion
of the work begun last year, of finding the best
route from Lake Nicaragua to the Pacific, for
which purpose three surveying parties will be
sent into the field. After this work is accom
plished, the Valley of the Sau Juan river will
he explored, and the best route from I/ike
Nicaragua to the Caribbean sea will bo laid
down.
The growth of Liverpool is something won
derful, according to English journals. They
declare that if the city continues to increase as
a port at its present rate, it will soon be
the largest in the world. Iu 17o7 the dock
dues amounted to only ?330 las.; in J850, very
nearly a century later they had reached ?242,
US9 14s. 9d., and now, iu the year 1872, the
great necessity is still for more accommoda
tion.
The Cincinnati Enquirer thinks that "the
Electoral College machinery should be abolish
ed aud the people vote directly through the
several States for President and Vice President.
Then, if the popular choice should happen to
die before his inauguration, the office would
fall where it constitutionally devolves?upon
the Vice President, who is elected with a view
to such a result."
Senator Pool, of North Carolina, telegraphs
to a Washington official that "we have defeat
ed the Democratic Legislature" by electing
Merrimon. He adds that it breaks up the
power of the Democrats, and "brings a valu
able and controlling element iu the State over
to the administration." The vote stood 87 lor
Merrimon and 80 for Vance.
The Washington correspondent of the Ciu
oinnnti Gazette states that the rules of etiquette
in Washington are to be made muoh uiore
formal and stringent and to be enforced with
rigid severity; and that the great strife is to be
"only in the folly displayed in the ladies' toil
ets aud the seuseless court paid to high offi -
cials."
The Prince William correspondent of the
Fredericksburg Star says that if the winter

Verdicts Againsttfie A. & F. 11. R. Co.?
There have been suits pending in the Circuit
Court of Alexandria for over a year, by various
parties, against the Alexandria and Fredericks
burg Railway Company, aggregating about
$20,UUO. These suits were mainly in the in
terest of the Engineer Corps that had survey
ed and located the road, during the period that
the road and its franchises were under the
control of Stewart <fc Co. The charter and its
franchises were purchased uearly two years ago
by what was understood as a branch of the
Pennsylvania Central. This company has re
sisted the payment of the claims against the
original company, which came down as alagacy
to the late purchasers.
List Spring some two or three of these
eases were tried in Alexandria before the Cir
cuit Court, and verdicts rcudercd against the
present Alexandria and Fredericksburg Com

would have been accepted by the Railway
Company as a judgment in regard to all simi

was reopeued at the pre>eut (fall) term of the

?The Now York World gives a list of the
names of fifty persons who have mysteriously
disappeared in that city since August last.
What a list! What sin and misery would we
have unfolded to view had we the history and
fate of each protraj'ed. The list embraces
from the tender age of twelve to the veteran
of sixty. Some of them have absconded?
some been knidnapped? some have stepped
from the paths of virtue and honor into the by
ways of sin and shame. The World calculates
that probably four-fifth* of the list may be ac
counted for on the score of voluntary .or com
pulsory absenteeism, but there still remains
ten or a dozen lives which have been suuft'od
out most mysteriously, aud whose manner of
passing away is jealously guarded as a dread
secret by the river and the streets. The de

the aid of Detectives were invoked in probably
almost every case of mysterious disappearance,

| Correspondence of the Alexandria (iazette. |
CnicAOu, Dee. 1, I>72.--Your correspon
dent arrived here on Saturday morning at seven
o'clock, having taken the s:5 p. tu. train iron
Baltimore via the "Pennsylvania Central."
Though this is tiot the f<ist lim: over the North
ern Central, yet, as there is but one change,
that at Pittsburg, it seems to me to be the
best, most pleasant, and 'tis said, the safest.
There is one other important advantage; to
this train i.- attached an elegant Pullman sleep
ing car, while to the 10:25 train there is none,
and there are with the last named two changes,
one at Ilarrisburg, the other at Pitt.-burg?the
one at Ilarrisburg about midnight, aud as it
was then snowing I did not regret having made
the selection, though I missed the beautiful
iCcuery afforded by day travel over the moun
tains in Pennsylvania. I mention those facts
for the banefit of your readers whose business
it is to travel in this direction. I have not been
here long enough, nor seen so much of the city,
as will euable me to form au opinion of its
greatness, its wealth and elegant buildings,
though I am free to confess I aui disappointed
in my expectation?, This arises, in part, be
cause Lam domiciled on the burnt district,
piled up in many places with the debris of the
late lire, but larger piles still of building ma
terial, being used in replacing the destroyed
houses, excavated sidewalks, made passable
with temporary timber footways, rendering
street crossing necessary, frequently, to get
along. This indicates that the entire district is
not actually rebuilt; many lots are still vacant,
a number of buildings incomplete, yet a vast
number are, if not entirely finished, occupied.
These buildings arc simply grand, grand be
yond all conception, and for the purpose intend
ed, extravagantly grand. The prices of proper
ty, to my sober senses, seem fictitious; the
cost of buildings and rents paid are too high,
and partake too much of the marvelous to bear
repeating. What would a first class Alexan
dria merchant think of a $75,000 per annum
rent. Even this amount is paid here in some
instances. Woe be to such should a financial
crisis come!
The Page building on Wabash Avenue and
Washington street, costing $2:J0,000 is to be
occupied by D. B. Fisk & Co., wholesale deal
ers in niillinary and fancy goods. 'J he dear
iadies arc able to wear, and perhaps their hus
bands to buy, at prices comparing with the
rent and co.-t of building. I might name others,
but euough for an idea. It seems to be con-^
ceded on all hands that the valuable part of
the city is tending south and west, property
outside of the city limits, south, btunir looked
to by speculators as affording the best field for
their operations, while property withiu the
city is somewhat depressed by some fire oidi
nance or tax which I am at present unable to
explain.

Q ?
The Gold Mines in Yiiuiinia.?That most
I of the mines in the State will pay handsomely
for the investment, if they are properly man
aged, there can be no doubt, it the recently
patented machine for extracting the gold from
the ore proves a success, or even half that is
claimed for it by the patentee. ,.
I have been for many years interested m the
different mines located in the State, and every
one of them was abandoned on account only of
the gold, after going down sixty feet, being
imbedded in pyrites, and the proper process of
desulphurizing the same had not been found.
The mines are more easily worked than any
others; the veins are more regular, and there
is an abundance ol gold in both the ore and
-late. The Valid use mines, especially, situa
ted near Fredericksburg, have always been pro
ductive. The large quantity of saud lying there
on the surface, if treated properly, would amply
repay the expense of the labor and time used
in its development. The mines in Louisa coun
ty, also, cau be recommended to capitalists as
being well worthy their attention.
I have always been satisfied that the \ ir
ginia tzold fields would eventually pay, and that
it was merelv from a want of capital, as well as
alack of judgmeut. that they had not been
made productive long ago. Gold mining has
heretofore been carried on as a speculative
business, and by no means worked scientifically.
If "capitalists will direct their attention to this
fact, aud see that in future their mines are
worked iu a legitimate manner, and opened
ami developed properly, there is no doubt but
that they can bo made to pay well.?Pittxhury

H ai in *a \. S kn ATi Mil Ah ( 'a i 'i rs.?The caucus
of radical Senators. called i*?r the purpose of
overhauling the committees; was held yesterday
in lhe reception room of the Senate. No iu
vitation was extended to the liberal republican
Senators to participate in the proceedings and
none of them, of course, wjre present. The
caucus la-ted about an hour, and was presided
over by Mr. Anthony. Ic is understood that a
stern determination was expressed by the ma
jority of those present to place the liberal Sena
tor.- on exactly the same footing as democrats,
to be treated in all respects precisely in the
same manner.
Two or three including, it is said Mr. Wilson
rather favored holding out to them the haud of
forgiveness, but this would not be listened to
by others, who said that if they came back at
all, they must take back seats and be put on a
long probation. A committee to revise the list
of landing committees was appointed consisting
of Messrs. Frelinghuysen, Morrill of Maine,
lvmsey, Lewis and Stewart. This committee
will report to the adjourned caucus to be held
to morrow, and it is perhaps needless to repeat
that every liberal who is now chairman of a
committee will be deposed.?Bait. /Sun.
