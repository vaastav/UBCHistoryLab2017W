Stated Disloyalty Among Cer

tional Life Serious
Menace to Peace.
Washington, Dec. 7. President Wil
son today delivered the following mes
sage to congress:
Gentlemen of the Congress: Since I
last had the privilege of addressing
you on the state of the Union the war
of nations on the other side of the sea,
which had then only begun to disclose
its portentous proportions, has extend
ed its threatening and sinister scope
until It has swept within its flame
some portion of every quarter of the
filobe, not excepting our own hemi
sphere, has altered the whole face of
International affairs, and now presents
a prospect of reorganization and re
construction such as statesmen and
peoples have never been called upon
to attempt before.
We have stood apart, studiously neu
tral. It was our manifest duty to do
bo. Not only did we have no part or
Interest in the policies which seem to
have brought the conflict on; it was
necessary, if a universal catastrophe
was to be avoided, that a limit should
be set to the sweep of destructive war
and that some part of the great family
of nations should keep the processes
of peace alive, If only to prevent col
lective economic ruin and the break
down throughout the world of the in
dustries by which its populations are
fed and sustained. It was manifestly
the duty of the self-governed nations
of this hemisphere to redress, if pos
sible, the balance of economic loss
and confusion in the other, if they
could do nothing more. In the day o'
readjustment and recuperation we
earnestly hope and believe that they
can be of infinite service.
American Nations Partners.
In this neutrality, to which they
were bidden not only by their separate
life and their habitual detachment
from the politics of Europe but also by
a clear perception of international
duty, the states of America have be
come conscious of a new and more
vital community interest and moral
partnership in affairs, more clearly
conscious of the many common sym
pathies and interests and duties which
bid them stand together.
There was a time in the early days
of our own .great nation and of the re
publics fighting their way to inde
pendence in Central and South Amer
ica when the government of the Unit
ed States looked upon itself as in some
tort the guardian of the republics to
the south of her as against any en
croachments or efforts at political con
trol from the other side of the water;
felt It its duty to play the part even
without invitation from them; and I
think that we can claim that the task
was undertaken with a true and dis
interested enthusiasm for the freedom
of the Americas and the unmolested
self-government of her independent
peoples. I?ut it was always difficult to
maintain such a role without offense
to the pride of the peoples whose free
dom of action we sought to protect,
and without provoking serious miscon
ceptions of our motives, and every
thoughtful man of affairs must wel
come the altered circumstances of the
new day in whose light we now stand,
when there Is no claim of guardian
ehlp or thought of wards but, instead,
a full and honorable association as of
partners between ourselves and our
neighbors, In the interest of all Amer
ica, north and south. Our concern for
the Independence and prosperity of the
states of Central and South America
is not altered. We retain unabated
the spirit that has Inspired us through
out the whole life of our government
and which was so frankly put Into
words by President Monroe. We still
mean always to make a common cause
of national independence and of po
litical liberty in America.
Attitude Toward Mexico.
We have been put to the test In
the case of Mexico, and we have stood
the test Whether we have benefited
Mexico by the course we have pursued
remains to bo seen. Her fortunes are
In her own hands. Hut we have at
least proved that we will not take ad
vantage of her in her distress and un
dertake to Impose upon her an order
und government of our own choosing.
We will aid and befriend Mexico, but
we will not coerce her; and our course
with regard to her ought to be sufll
fient proof to all America that wo
seek no political suzerainty or selfish
control.
Tbo moral is, that the 6tates of
America are not hostile rivals but co
operating friends, and that their grow
ing sense of community of interest,
alike- in matters political and In mat
ters economic, Is likely to give them
a new significance as factors In inter
national affairs and in the political
history of the world.
Drawing the Americas Together.
There Is, I venture to point out, an
especial significance Just now attach
ing to this whole matter of drawing
the Americas together in bonds of hon
orable partnership and mutual advan
tage because of the economic readjust
ments which the world must inevi
tably witness within the next genera
tion, when peace shall have at last re
sumed its healthful tasks. In the per
formance of these tasks I believe the
Americas to be destined to play their
parts together. I am interested to fix
your attention on this prospect now
becauso unless you take It within your
view and permit the full significance
of it to command your thought I can
not find the right light in which to set
forth the particular matter that lies
at the very front of my whole thought
as I address you today. I mean na
tional defense.
No one who really comprehends the
spirit of the great people for whom
we aro appointed to speak can fail to
perceive that their passion is for
peace, their genius best displayed in
the practice of tho arts of peace. Great
democracies ?.re not belligerent. They
do not seek or desire war. Their
thought Is of individual liberty and of
the tree labor that supports life and
the uncensored thought that quickens
it. Conquest and dominion are not In
our reckoning, or agreeable to our
principles. Cut just because we de
mand unmolested development and
the undisturbed government of our
own lives upon our own principles of
right and liberty, wo resent, from
whatever quarter it may come, the ag
gression we ourselves will not prac
tice. We insist upon security in prose
cuting our self-chosen lines of nation
al development. We do more than that.
We demand it also for others.
Question of Preparedness.
Out of such thoughts grow all our
policies. We regard war merely as a
means of asserting the rights of a peo
ple against aggression. And we are
as fiercely Jealous of coercive or dic
tatorial power within our own nation
as of aggression from without. We
will not maintain a standing army ex
cept for uses which are as necessary
in times of peace as in times of war;
and we shall always see to it that our
military peace establishment is no
larger than is actually and continu
ously needed for the uses of days in
which no enemies move against us.
Hut we do believe in a body of free
citizens ready and suthcient to take
care of themselves and of the govern
ments which they have set up to serve
them.
13ut war has never boon a mere mat
tor of men and guns. It is a thing of
disclj lined might. If our citizens are
ever to light effectively upon a sudden
summons, they must know ho-.v mod
ern lirhting is dor; and what to do
when tin; summons coir.es to render
themselves immediately available and
immediately effective. And the gov
ernment must be their servant in this
matter, must supply them with the
training they need to take care of
themselves and of it.
It is with these ideals in mind that
the plans of the department of war
for more adequate national defense
were conceived which will bo laid be
fore you, and which I urgo you to
sanction and put into effect as soon
as they can be properly scrutinized
and discussed. They seem to me the
essential first steps, and they seem
to mo for the present sufficient.
Larger Army Plan.
They contemplate on increase of the
standing forco of the regular army
from its present strength of 5,023
officers and 102.9S3 enlisted men of
all services to a strength of 7,1 3G
officers and 131,707 enlisted men,
or 141.S43, all told, all services,
rank and file, by the addition
of fifty-two companies of coast
artillery, fifteen companies of engi
neers, ten regiments of infantry, four
regiments of field artillery, and four
aero squadrons, besides 750 officers
required for a great variety of extra
service, especially the all important
duty of training the citizen force of
which I shall presently speak, 792
noncommissioned officers for serv
ice in drill, recruiting and the
like, and tho necessary quota of on
listed men for the quartermaster
corps, tho hospital corps, the ord
nance department, and other similar
auxiliary services. These are the ad
ditions necessary to render the army
adequate for its present duties, duties
which it has to perform not only upon
our own continental coasts and bor
ders and at our interior array posts,
but also in the Philippines, in the
Hawaiian Islands, at the isthmus, and
in Porto Itico.
By way of making the country ready
to assert some part of its real power
promptly and upon a larger scale,
should occasion arise, tho plan also
contemplates supplementing the army
by a force of 400,000 disciplined citi
zens, raised in Increments of 133,
000 a year throughout a period
of three years. This It is proposed
to do by a process of enlistment un
der which the serviceable men of tho
country would be asked to bind them
selves to serve with tho colors for pur
poso of training for short periods
throughout three years, and to come
to tho colors at call at any time
throughout an additional "furlough"
period of three years. This forco of
400,000 men would be provided with
personal accoutrements as fast as
enli3ted and their equipment for
the field mado ready to be sup
plied at any time. They would be
assembled for training at stated In
tervals at convenient places In asso
ciation with suitablo units of the
regular army. Their period of annual
training would not necessarily exceed
two months in tho year.
At least so much by tho way of
preparation for defense seems to me
to bo absolutely Imperative now. We
cannot do less.
The Naval Program.
The program which will be laid be
fore you by tho secretary of the navy
Is similarly conceived. It involves
only a shortening of the time within
STRIKING POINTS IN PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE
The department of war contemplates an Increase of the standing
force of the regular army from its present strength of 5,023 officers
and 102,935 enlisted men to 7,136 officers and 134,707 enlieted men, and
supplementing the army by a force of 4CO.000 disciplined citizens.
It will be to the advantage of the country for the congress to adopt
a comprehensive plan for putting the navy upon a final footing of
strength and efficiency.
The gravest threats against our national peace and safety have
been uttered within our own borders.
It is necessary for many weighty reasons of national efficiency and
development that we should have a great merchant marine.
It seems to me a clear dictate of prudent statesmanship and frank
finance that in what we are now to undertake we should pay as we go.
We should be following an almost universal example of modern gov
ernment if we were to draw the greater part or even the whole of the
revenues we need from the income' taxes.
We have been put to the test in the case of Mexico and we have
stood the test. Whether we have benefited Mexico by the course we
have pursued remains to be seen. Our concern for the independence
and prosperity of the 6tates of Central and South America is not
altered.
which plans long matured shall be
carried out; but it does make definite
and explicit a program which has
heretofore been only implicit, held in
the minds of the two committees on
naval affairs and disclosed in the de
bates of the two houses but nowhere
formulated or formally adopted. It
seems to me very clear that it will be
to the advantage of the country for
the congress to adopt a comprehen
sive plan for putting the navy upon
a final footing of strength and' effi
ciency and to rress that plan to com
pletion within tho next five years.
We have always looked to the navy of
the country as our first and chief
line of defense; we have always seen
it to be our manifest course of pru
dence to be strong on tho seas. Year
by year we have been creating a navy
which now ranks very high indeed
among the navies of the maritime na
tions. We should now definitely de
termine how we shall complete what
we have begun, and how soon.
Tho program to be laid before you
contemplates the construction within
live years of ten battleships, six bat
tle cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty
destroyers, fifteen fleet submarines,
eighty-five coart submarines, four pun
boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni
tion ships, two fuel oil ships, and one
regular repair ship. It is proposed
that of this number we shall the first
year provide for tho construction of
two battleships, two battle cruisers,
three scout cruisers, liftcn destroyers,
live fleet submarines, twenty-live coast
submarines, two gunboats, and one
hospital ship; the second year, two
battleships, one scout cruiser, ten de
stroyers, four fleet submarines, fifteen
coast submarines, ouo gunb'iat, and
ono fuel oil ship; the third year, two
battleships, one battle cruiser, two
scout cruisers, five destroyers, two
fleet submarines, and fifteen coast
submarines; the fourth year, two bat
tleships, two battle cruisers, two scout
cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet sub
marines, fifteen coast submarines, one
ammunition ship, and one fuel oil
ship; and the fifth year, two battle
ships, one battle cruiser, two scout
cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet sub
marines, fifteen coast submarines, ono
gunboat, one ammunition ship, and
one repair ship.
More Men for the Navy.
The secretary of tho navy is asking
also for the immediate addition to the
personnel of the navy of 7,500 sail
ors, 1,200 apprentice seamen, and
1,500 marines. This increase would
be sufficient to care for the ships
which are to bo completed with
in the fiscal year 1917 and also for the
number of men which must be put in
training to man the ships which will
be completed early in 1918. It is also
necessary that the number of midship
men at the Naval academy at Annap
olis Bhould be increased by at least
three hundred
If this full program should be car
ried out we should have built or build
ing In 1921, according to the estimates
of survival and standards of classifi
cation followed by the general board
of the department, an effective navy
consisting of 27 battleships, of the first
line, 6 battle cruisers, 25 battleships
of the second line, 10 armored cruis
ers, 13 scout cruiserB, 5 first-class
cruisers, 3 second-class cruisers, 10
third-class cruisers, 108 destroyers, 18
fleet submarines, 157 coast submarines.
C monitors , 20 gunboats, 4 supply
ships, 15 fuel ships, 4 transports,
3 tenders .to torpedo vessels, 8 ves
sels of special types, and 2 ammuni
tion ships. This would be a navy fit
ted to our needs and worthy of our
traditions.
But armies and Instruments of war
are only part of what has to be con
sidered If we are to consider the su
preme matter of national self-sufficiency
and security In all Its aspects.
There are other great matters which
will be thrust upon our attention
whether we will or not. There Is, for
example, a very pressing question of
trade and shipping Involved In this
great problem of national adequacy.
It Is necessary for many weighty rea
sons of national efficiency and devel
opment that we should have a great
merchant marine.
It Is high time we repaired our mis
take and resumed our commercial Inde
pendence on the seas.
Need of Merchant Marine.
For It Is a question of Independ
ence. If other nations go to war or
seek to hamper each other's com
merce, our merchants, It seems, are
at their mercy, to do with as they
pleaso. Wo must use their ships, and
use them as they determine. Wo havo
not ships enough of our own. We
cannot handle our own commerce on
tho seas. Our Independence Is provin
cial, and H only on land and within
our own borders. W are not likely
to be nermttted to us4 even the ships
of other nations in rivalry of their
own trade, and are without means to
extend our commerce even where the
doors are wide open and our goods
desired. Cuch a situation is not to
bo endured. It Is of capital import
ance not only that the United States
should be its own carrier on tho seas
and enjoy the economic independence
which only an adequate merchant ma
rine would give it, but also that the
American hemisphere as a whole
should enjoy a like Independence and
self-sufficiency, If It is not to be drawn
into the tangle of European affairs.
Without such independence the whole
question of our political unity and
self-determination is very seriously
clouded and complicated indeed.
Moreover, we can develop no true
or effective American policy without
ships of our own not ships of war,
but ships of peace, carrying goods and
carrying much more; creating friend
ships and rendering indispensable
services to all interests on this sido
the water.
Must Provide Ships.
With a view to meeting these
pressing necessities of our commerce
and availing ourselves at the earliest
possible moment of the present un
paralleled opportunity of linking the
two Americas together in bonds of mu
tual interest and service, an opi'or
tunity which may never return acain
if we miss it now, proposals will bo
made to the present congress lor tho
purchase or construction of ship3 to
be owned and directed by the govern
ment similar to those made to the last
congress, but modified in Fome essen
tial particulars. I recommend these
proposals to you for your prompt ac
ceptance with tho more confidence
because every month that ha3 elapsed
since the former proposals were made
has made tho necessity for such action
more and more manifestly imperative.
That need was then foreseen; it is
now acutely felt and everywhere real
ized by those for whom trade is wait
ing but who can find no conveyance
for their goods. I am not so much in
terested In tho particulars of tho pro
gram as I am in taking immediate ad
vantage of tho great opportunity which
awaits us if we will but act in this
emergency.
The plans for the armed forces of
tho nation which I have outlined, and
for tho general policy of adequate
preparation for mobilization and de
fense, involve of course very large ad
ditional expenditures of money ex
penditures which will considerably ex
ceed the estimated revenues of the
government. It is mado my duty by
law, whenever the estimates of ex
penditure exceed tho estimates of
revenue, to call tho attention of tho
congress to the fact and suggest any
means of meeting the deficiency that
it may be wise or possible for me to
suggest. I am ready to believe that it
would bo my duty to do so in any case;
and I feel particularly bound to speak
of the matter when it appears that tho
deficiency will arise directly out of
the adoption by the congress of meas
ures which I myself urgo it to adopt.
Allow me, therefore, to speak briefly
of the present state of the treasury
and of the fiscal problems which the
next year will probably disclose.
State of the Finances.
On the thirtieth of June last there
was an available balance in the gen
eral fund of the treasury of $104,170.
105.78. The total estimated receipts
for the year 1916, on the assumption
that the emergency revenue measure
passed by the last congress will not bo
extended beyond its present limit, the
thirty-first of December, 1915, and
that thepresent duty of ono cent per
pound on sugar will be discontinued
after the first of May, 1916, will be
$670,865,500. The balance of June last
and these estimated revenues come,
therefore, to a grand total of $774,
435,605.78. The total estimated dis
bursements for the present fiscal year.
Including $25,000,000 for the Panama
canal, $12,000,000 for probable de
ficiency appropriations, and $50,
000 for miscellaneous debt redemp
tions, will bo $753,891,000; and
the balance In the general fund of tho
treasury will be reduced to $20,614,
605.78. The emergency revenue act, If
continued beyond Its present time lim
itation, would produce, during tho half
year then remaining, about $41,000,
000. The duty of ono cent per pound
on sugar. If continued, would produce
during the two months of the fiscal
year remaining after the first of May,
about $15,000 000. Theno two sums,
amounting together to $56,000,000, If
added to tho revenues of tho second
half of tho fiscal year, would yield the
treasury at the end of tho year an
available balance of $76,644,C05.78.
The additional revenues required
to carry out the program of military
and naval preparation of which I have
spoken, would, as at present estimated,
be for the fiscal year 1917, $93,800,000.
Those .figures, taken with the figures
for the present fiscal year which I
have already given, disclose our finan
cial problem for the year 1917. As
suming that the taxes Imposed by the
emergency revenue act and the pres
ent dutj on sugar are to be discontin
ued, ano that the balance at the close
of the present fiscal year will be only
$20,644,60r.-8, that the disbursements
for the Panama canal will again be
about twenty-five millions, and that
the additional expenditures for the
army and navy are authorized by the
congress, the ' deficit In the general
fund of the treasury on the thirtieth
of June, 1917, will be nearly two hun
dred and thiity-flvo millions To this
sum at least fifty millions should be
added to represent a Bafe working bal
ance for the treasury, and twelve mil
lions to include tho usual deficiency
estimates In 1917; and these additions
would make a total deficit of some two
hundred and ninety-seven millions. If
the present taxes should be continued
throughout this year and the next,
however, there would be a balance in
the treasury of some seventy-six and
a half millions at the end of the pres
ent fiscal year, and a deficit at the
end of the next year of only soma fifty
millions, or, reckoning in sixty-two
millions for deficiency appropriations
and a safe treasury belance at the end
of the year, a total deficit of some
one hundred and twelve millions. The
obvious moral of the figures is that it
is a plain counsel of prudence to con
tinue all of tho preesnt taxes or their
equivalents, and confine ourselves, to
the problem of providing $112,000,600
of new revenue rather than $297,000,
000. New Sources Qf Revenue.
How shall we obtain the new reve
nue? It seems to me a clear dictate of
prudent statesmanship and frank
finance that in what wo are now, I
hope, to undertake, we should pay as
we go. The people of the country aro
entitled tr now just what burdens of
taxation they are to carry, and to know
from the outset, now. Tho new bills
should be paid by Internal taxation.
To what sources, then, ihall we
turn? This is so peculiarly a question
which the gentlemen of the house of
representatives aro expected under
tho Constitution to propose an answer
to that you will hardly expect me to
do more than discuss it in very gen
eral terms. We should bo following
nn almost universal example of mod
ern government if we were to draw
the greater part or even the whole of
the revenues we ned from the in
come taxes. 15 y somewhat lowering the
present limits of exemption and tho
figure at which the surtax i-hall begin
to be imposed, aud by increasing, step
by ftcp throughout tho present gradu
ation, tho surtax itself, the income
taxes as at present apportioned
would yield sums sullicient to balance
the books of the treasury at the end
of the fiscal year 1917 without any
where making the burden unreason
ably or oppressively heavy. The pre
cise reckonings are fully and accurate
ly set out In the report, of the secre
tary of the treasury which will be im
mediately laid before you.
And there are many additional
sources of revenue which can justly be
resorted to without hampering tiie in
dustries of the country or putting any
too great charge upon individual ex
penditure. A one per cent tax per
gallon on gasollno and naptha would
yield, at tho present estimated pro
duction, $10,000,000; a tax of 50 cents
per horse power on automobiles and
internal explosion engines, $i5,0o0,
000; a stamp tax on bank checks,
probably $18,000,000; a tax of 25 cents
per ton on pig iron, $10,000,000; a tax
of 50 cents per ton on fabricated iron
and steel, probably $10,000,000. In a
country of great industries like this it
ought to be easy to distribute the bur
dens of taxation without makiug them
anywhere bear too heavily or too ex
clusively upon any one set of persons
or undertakings. What Is clear is,
that tho industry of this generation
should pay the bills of this generation.
I have spoken to you today, gentle
men, upon a single theme, the thor
ough preparation of the nation to care
for its own security and to make sure
of entire freedom to play the impartial
rolo in this hemisphere and in the
world which we all believe to have
been providentially assigned to It. I
have had in my mind no thought of
any immediate or particular danger
arising out of our relations with other
nations. We are at peaco with all
the nations of the world, and there Is
reason to hope that no question in
controversy between this and other
governments will lead to any serious
breach of amicable relations, grave as
some differences of attitude and policy
have been and may yet turn out to be.
I am. sorry to say thai the gravest
threats against our national peace and
safety have been uttered within our
own borders. There are citizens of
the United States, I blush to admit,
born under other flags but welcomed
under our generous naturalization
laws to the full freedom and oppor
tunity of America, who havo poured
the poison of disloyalty into the very
arteries of our national lfe; who havo
sought to bring the authority and
good name of our government Into
contempt, to destroy our Industries
wherever they thought it effective for
their vindictive purposes to strike at
them, and to debaso our politics to
tho uses of foreign intrigue. Their
number is not great as compared with
the Whole number of those sturdy
hosts by which our nation has boon
enriched in recent generations out
of virile foreign stocks; but it Is great
enough to have brought deep disgrace
upon os and to have mado it neces
sary that wo should promptly make
use of processes of law by which we
may be purged of" their corrupt dis
tempers. America never witnessed
Anything like this before. It never
dreamed It possible that men sworn
Into Its own citizenship, men drawn
out of great free stocks Buch as sup
plied some of the best and strongest
elements of that little, but how heroic,
nation that in a high day of old staked
its very life to free itself from every
entanglement that had darkened the
fortunes of the older nations and set
up a new standard here that men
of such origins and such free choices
of allegiance would ever turn In
malign reaction against the govern
ment and people who had welcomed
and nurtured them and Beek to make
this proud country once more a hot
bed of European passion. A little
while ago such a thing would have
seemed Incredible. Because it was
incredible we made no preparation
for It. We wuld have been almost
ashamed to prepare for It, as If we
were suspicious of ourselves, our own
comrades and neighbors! Hut the
ugly and Incredible thing has actual
ly come about and we are without
adequate federal laws to deal with it.
1 urge you to enact such laws at tho
ealiest possible moment and feel that
in doing so I am urging you to do
nothing less than save the honor and
self-respect of the nation. Such crea
tures of passion, disloyalty, and an
archy must be crushed out. They are
not many, but they are infinitely
malignant, and the hand of our power
should close over them at once. They
have formed plots to destroy property,
they havo entered into conspiracies
against the neutrality of the govern
ment, they havo sought to pry into
every confidential transaction of the
government in order to serve interests
alien to our own. It is possible to
deal with these things very effectually.
I need not suggest the terms in which
they may bo dealt with.
Are Disgrace to the Nation.
I wish that it could be said that
only a few men, misled by mistaken
sentiments of allegiance to tho govern
ments under which they were born,
had been guilty of disturbing the self
possesiJon and misrepresenting the
temper and principles of the country
during these days of terrible war.
when it would seem that every man
who was truly an American would
instinctively make it his duty and his
rride to keep the scales of Judgment
even and prove himself a partisan of
no nation but his own. But it cannot
There are some men among us, and
many resident abroad who, though
born and bred in the United States
and calling themselves Americans,
have so forgotten themselves and
their honor as citizens as to put their
passionate sympathy with one or the
other side in the great European con
flict above their regard for the peace
and dignity of the United States. They
also preach and practice disloyalty.
No laws, I suppose, can reach cor
ruptions of the mind and heart; but 1
should not speak of others without
also speaking of these and expressing
the even deeper humiliation and scorn
which every self-possessed and
thoughtfully patriotic American must
feel when he thinks of them and of
the discredit they are daily bringing
upon us.
While we speak of the preparation
of the nation to make sure of her
security and her effective power we
must not fall into the patent error of
supposing that her real strength
comes from armaments and mere safe
guards of written law.
What Is more important is, that the
industries and resources of the coun
try should be available and ready for
mobilization.
Tho transportation problem is an
exceedingly serious and pressing one
in this country. There has from
time to time of late been reason
to fear that our railroads would
not much longer bo able to cope with
it successfully, as at present equipped
and co-ordained. I suggest that it
would bo wise to provide for a com
mission of inquiry lo ascertain by a
thorough canvass of the whole ques
tion whether our laws as at present
framed and administered are as serv
iceable as they might bo In the solu
tion of the problem. It is obviously a
problem that lies at the very founda
tion of our efficiency as a people. Such
an Inquiry ought to draw out every
circumstance and opinion worth con
sidering and we need to know all sides
of the matter If we mean to do any
thing In the field of federal legislation.
Regulation of Railroads.
No one, I am sure, would wish to
take any backward step. The regula
tion of the railways of the country by
federal commission has had admirable
results and has fully Justified the
hopes and expectations of those by
whom the policy of regulation was
originally proposed. The question Is
not what should wo undo? It Is,
whether there Is anything else we can
do that would supply us with effective
means, in the very process of regula
tion, for bettering the conditions un
der which the railroads are operated
and for making them more useful serv
ants of the country as a whole. It
seems to me that it might be the part
of wisdom, therefore,- before further
legislation in this field is attempted, to
look at the whole problem of co-ordination
and efficiency In the full light of a
fresh assessment of circumstance and
opinion, as a guide to dealing with the
several parts of it.
For what wo are seeking now, what
In my mind is the single thought of
this message, Is national efficiency and
security. We serve a great nation.
We should servo It in the spirit of its
peculiar genius. It Is the genius of
common men for self government. In
dustry, Justice, liberty and peace. We
should see to It that It lacks no instru
mcnt, no facility or vigor of law, to
make it sufficient to play its part with
energy, safety and assured success. In
this we are no partisans but heralds
and prophets of a new age.
