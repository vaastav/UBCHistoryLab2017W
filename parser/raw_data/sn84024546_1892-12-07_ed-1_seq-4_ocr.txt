HARRISONS CLOSING 3IESSAGE.
President Harrison's closing message
devoies a large share of its space to a
showing of the growth and prosperity of
the country under the protective policy.
The President recognizes that this is treat
ing of an issue which, for the present at
least, is adjudicated against his party. He
even directly specifies the expectation that
the incoming party in power will radically
change that policy. But he appropriately
takes his closing message to mark the close
of the protective era, and therefore im
proves the opportunity to sum up the re
sults of that era. His showing is forcible,
and as a valedictory for the protective
theory in government it is a dignified and
impressive document
In discussing tbe policy which is ex
pected to prevail beyond the term of his
administration, Mr. Harrison is disposed
to take the extreme view that the Democ
racy is pledged to revise the tariff on the
radical lines of a tariff for revenue only.
That isaccompaniedbyastrong intimation
that the Democratic pledges require such
prompt action as to demand an extra
session. The views of a President with
regard to the policy of the party which
Euceeeds him can be no more than a per
sonal opinion, and on this point he Is in
error. While the Democratic position
may be in dispute, it is pertinent that the
Democratic pronouncement for an extreme
revenue tariff was practically revoked by
the Democratic candidate during the late
campaign. The pledge of Mr. Cleveland
before his election was clearlyfora conser
vative and deliberate revision of the tariff
schedules. There will be nothing incon
sistent with that pledge either in shaping
tariff changes so as -to create as little In
dustrial disturbance as follows, or in de
voting the next year to a careful and dis
passionate study of the question how that
Bhali be done. Such a course will com
mand public support. The thinking peo
ple, whether Democrats or Republicans,
are not in favor of hasty legislation on the
tariff. V
The President naturally presents with
some pride the showing of the reduction
of debt during his term. He makes good
the claim that the disappearance of the
surplus is more than balanced by pay
ments on the debt of more than three
times the amount In addition he shows
a better balance of receipts and expendi
tures for the last fiscal year than was ex
pected; but omits to state that the chief
credit for this is due to the administra
tion's very proper course in keeping the
expenditures largely within the heavy
appropriations of the last Congress.
Future action as to revenue and monetary
policy is calmly and philosophically re
ferred to the next Congress.
The review of bur foreign relations, the
figures as to the growth of our foreign
commerce, and the settlement of the ques
tions at issue with other powers are all
set forth in a strong light Upon the
question of ship canals, both to the South
and to the North, the message opens up
some interesting points. His commenda
tion of the Nicaragua Canal scheme may
be accepted except as it implies the
passage of the pending bill for the loan of.
the Government. The opposition of inde
pendent people is not to the canal itself,
but to the proposition introduced at the
last session. That virtually made the
United States pay for it without owning
it, and in addition permitted for the ex
penditure a margin of $35,000,000 of the
monjy of the United States on it above
the engineers' estimates. There is also
the vital objection that internal canals,
such as that between Lake Erie and Pitts
burg, should be built first or at least co
temporaneously with any Government
undertaking of the Nicaragua project
The recommendation as to the bearing
on our relations w.th Canada of a ship
canal from the lakes to the Hudson river is
one that is to be indorsed. It is by such
projects as that that the advantages which
Canada now holds in her ship canals are
to be equalized. Such a canal would be a
direct aid to the Ohio river and Lake Erie
project, as both would be essential links
in a national system of internal water
ways. Taken as a whole, the message is philo
sophical and well-put It possesses the
characteristics which have marked Presi
dent Harrison's state papers, of positive
views presented in the strongest and yet
most dignified tone. Its possession of
those qualities is esnecially interesting in
the document that sets forth the record of
an administration which, whlIe"not posi
tively successful at its close, has been
notably accompanied by the prosperity
and success of the nation under its care.
caeeeess as to dates.
The necessity for a little research in the
production of historical fables Is pleas
antly illustrated by the story of the
pauper who died the other day at Lima,
O., claiming to be the son of the first
Napoleon. The story alleges as facts that
he was bom in Paris in 1786; that he ac
companied Napoleon to Egypt in 1796;
that he was there captured by the Arabs,
and atter living a nomadic life of several
years came to this country, where he
seems to have spent the greater part of the
century without any exhibition of having
inherited the rising qualities of his al
leged parent
Besides the fact that this would make
the claimant 106 years old at the time of
his death; that it tal him on tbeEgypt-
lan campaign at U -nder age 'of 10, J
and then takes
iroup;D. acareer
tracing of atfil-
which woKid renc"
opia rem
lefritimato parentage wel'-nijih impossi
ble, there are other obstacles to belief
presented in the story. There is some
doubt as to thcexict birth of Napoleon
L, but the best authority would make
him 16 at the birth of his alleged son.
More than that, this story implies
his residence at Paris in the years 1785 and
1783, while the fact is that in the former
year he was' sent to his regiment at
Valence.
The yarn is not important enough to
warrant much pains in its examination.
.But tbe illustration of the necessity of
more care in the construction of historical
fables is worth bearing in mind by the
next experimenter in that field.
crvn. service reforsl
The extracts from the ninth annual re
port of the Civil Service Commission, as
published elsewhere in this issue, indicate
that.it is doing good work.- The efficiency
of. the Commission within its all too lim
ited range is a strong argument for ex
tending its field of usefulness. It is satis
factory to note the reported decrease in
the practice of assessing Government em
ployes for campaign purposes. And the
proposition to make solicitation for parti
san funds from such "sources in any place
a penal offense deserves support, as well
calculated to aid effectually in suppress
ing the evil. Tne request for a rapid
extension of the classified service, and a
rearrangement to reduce the number of
excepted offices, ought to be satisfied with
out' delay.
Civil service reform In which competi
tive examinations and promotion by merit
tend to displace the spoils system by busi
ness principles cannot be too muchpn
couraged or too widely extended. Amer
ica is proud of the common sense and
business instincts of its citizens, and yet
they permit the National Government to
be managed by methods which, adapted
to private enterprise, would result in a
certain reduction of profits and a probable
consummation of ruin.
There is little to hope from the "Demo
cratic party, flushed with victory and
pledged to the spoils system, in the wy
of civil service reform legislation. But in
bis handling of Federal patronage Mr.
Cleveland will have a grand opportunity
to demonstrate his sincerity in advocating
such reform that, properly made use of,
cannot fail to be a useful example to his
successors and a demonstration of its ad
vantages to the nation.
MR. CURRIES METAPHORS.
Mr. Bertram Currie, one of the English
delegates to the Brussels Monetary Con
ference, is pleased to disapprove of the
course of the United States. Reports
credit him with making a savage attack
on "American selfishness" in the matter
of silver, to have protested against making
Europe "a scapegoat for tbe Yankees,"
and to have joined with this a telling and
original reference to "pulling chestnuts
out of the fire."
All of which Is typically charming as
coming from a Bank of England director.
The Threadneedle street point of view is
evidently that some one must purchase
silver, and that for anyone else to do it
but the United States would be establish
ing a scapegoat; while for the United
States to suggest that the division urged
by Rothschilds, of half as much silver
being purchased by the rest of the world
as the United States is to purchase is de
cidedly jug-handled and a gross example
of American selfishness. The sug
gestion that the United States
must not object to be the scape
goat or to pulling 534,000,000 of
sliver chestnuts annually out of the fire,
Is of course not selfishness. It is simply
the typical British attitude -'an important
difference in terms, if not' in the actual
fact
It begins to look as if it might be In
structive to Mr. Currie and his confreres
if the United States should stop silver pur
chases, put its stock of silver on the
market, and draw on the world at large
for the Increase of Its gold reserve. Our
English friends might then be able to
locate the scapegoat more accurately
during their search for some one to pull,
not the chestnuts, but themselves out of
tbe fire.
NOT better fob RUSSIA.
"When the Czar of Russia declared ayear
ago that there was no famine there the
assertion was generally looked upon as an
attempt to ignore a great disaster. That
there was actual famine in some provinces
is now beyond dispute; but what the
Autocrat probably meant Is corroborated
from an unexpected source. The English
Consul at Kieff, in a report recently pre
sented to Parliament, sys the famine was
due to the failure of crops in certain dis
tricts, and that the transportation system
of Russia made such a break-down that
while people were starving in some prov
inces immense quantities of grain were
suffered to rot in the Caucasus.
While this new state of affairs gave'little
relief to the people who died of hunger
or famine fever, it permits tbe belief that
tbe Czar's assertion was correct as a state
ment that Russia had grain enough.in her
borders to feed her people. But with due
credit to His 'Muscovite Majesty's desire
for veracity, it is difficult to see how the
position of bis Government is improved
by the amended statement Indeed,
it would have been more to
the credit of the Imperial Government
had tbe former account been the true one.
No Government, however paternal, could
be expected to prevent universal disaster
to tbe crops; while the Russian Govern
ment, operating as It does the railway sys
tem, and exerting paternal supervision'
over tne entire empire, must Da held re
sponsible for the failure to take food from J
the provinces, where It was plenty, to
those where it was needed. No more re
markable demonstration of the worthless
ness and utter inefficiency of absolutism
could be imagined than the spectacle of
Russian subjects dying of famine In one
part of tbe empire and surplus food going
to waste In another.
It will not take many more illustrations
of the sort to convince the Russian people
that a Government which cannot fulfill tbe
functions it assumes is not worth enduring
any longer.
ONE "WAX TO DO IT.
It is worthy of notice and commenda
tion that the management of the Boston
Theater have made a new, though it must
be confessed rather faint, attempt to abol
ish the theater hat nuisance. Messrs.
.Abbey, Schoefel and Grau print upon
their programmes a request to tbe ladles
to "aid in the work of hat reform" and
"wear a snvtfl bonnet or remove your large
hat during the performance."
Det ns hope that the Boston ladics'will
accord a mote favorable response to this
modest request than there is much reason
to expect The female mind in this mat
ter of the theater hat has shown itself
superior alike to ridicule, reason, or good
manners. Perhaps it is consistent, since
female fashion, pays jq regard to the per
sonal comfort of its devotees who Wear Its'
i costumes, that it should exhibit even a
calmer disregam lortnaiightsandeoHi-
fort cf those whom it debars from seeing
a stage performance. But the combina
tion of bad manners and insensibility be
trayed by feminine theater-goers in ignor
ing all attempts to abolish the theater hat
proves that the only way to secure a vol
untary movement of this sort among the
sex is to convince them that It is the fash
ion not tojwear it
Yet even in that phase the hopelessness
of attempting to. influence the average
feminine mind by argument is displayed j
in tbe fact that really fashionable circles,
namely, the aristocratic people of Europe,
discarded the theater hat so long ago that
tbe .memory of man runneth not to the
contrary. No woman with any pretensions
to fashion would ever appear In a Euro
pean theater in an out door bead-dress; yet
the women of America resist all appeals
to their courtesy in the matter of thsat
ncal bats under the delusion that fashion
requires them to wear that obstructive
headgear. Under such circumstances the
managers who really desire to reform this
matter will simply "have to enforce the
rule of foreign theatere to admit no lady
to the auditorium with her hat on. After
a brief struggle the theater which main
tained thatrule would "become the most
popular and fashionable of its class.
A FEW snubs can do little hurt to inch
an one as John I. Davenport. But that ad
mlnisteied by a committee of the House
yesterday should bear some fruit as a warn

Twelve Brooklyn clergymen of various

of the undertaking is a weekly ride of club

they see of one another the more they will
have in common and the better they will be
able to pull together for thoso things de
sired of all.

Canada's so-called loyalty to England
means a- sacrifice of business interests to
mere sentimentalism. The Unionists pro
pose to sacrifice sentimenta'.ism to business
Interests, and in an era of ultra-utilitarianism
the outcome is not doubtful. Canada's
separation from England can-only be a mat
ter of time, and Canada's entry into the
United States Is the logical sequel thereto.

The message is an instructive, historical

sensationally exciting.
Senator Hill will do well to accept any
$25,000 a year position that he can secure
from a private corporation. The country
will never do as much for him, and the
longer he displays his petty personality in
national affairs, the lower he will sink in tbe

assume will be largely neglected.

CAUGHT AT THE CAPITAL
Kcport or the Civil Service Commission
Acilvo "Work Done In the Lato Cam
paign Soino of the BUI Introduced In
Congress Yesterday Theories of the
Third Farty. 1
Washington, pec. 6. The United
States Civil Sorvlce cfommlsslon to-day
made public its ninth report to the Presi
dent. It shows that from July 1, 1891, to
June SO, 1392, the ..whole number of appli
cants examined for tho fivo bronohes of the
classified sorvlce was 19.40). of whom 12,100
vasscd and 7,300 failed to pass. Compared
witn the previous year this shows an In
crease of SOS in tbe whole numborexamlned,
a deoreasa in the whole number who passed
of 526, and an increase in the whole number
who failed to pass of .1,012. Tho whole num
ber appointed in the year covered by this
report Is as follows: Departmental service;
173: customs service, 161; postal service,
2,113; railway mail service, 1,199, and Indian
service. 10; total, 3 9C1; a decrease 'of 1,131
over the previous year.
Of political assessments the report says!
"This is the' first time tho Civil Service
commission has, in tbe midst of a Presiden
tal campaign, actively Interfered to pre
vent the collection of these assessments,
and it believes its action had a most bene
ficial effect, and that there was much less
assessing done than over before, although
It cannot bo doubted that us It was alto
gether too much took place. In tbe opinion
oftho Commission this practice will not be
wholly broken up until it is made a penal
offense for any person whatsoever to solicit a
political contribution Irom a Government
employe In any placo whatsoever."
All Bests "With, tho Attorney General.
The commission calls attention to the
systomatlo efforts mado In varloiu States to
collect assessments Irom Government em
ployes. In all tho cotes it promptly pub
lished the facts in full and handed tho
testimony ever to the Attorney General.
The comuiisnion declares that the classified
service should bo extended as rapidly as
practicable, as, for instance, to clerks and
writers in navy yards, to the internal reve
nno service, to custom houses with 25 em
ployes, and to fiee delivery postofilses. The
Nattonul'Lelter Carriers Association, acting
in its capacity of a branch or the Knizhts or
Labor, hns recommended that all Iree de
livery offices be classified. The letter car
riers aro just lllto other American citizens;
thev want to leel that wben they do the
work of tho public honestly, zealously and
intelligently, tnev snouiu not oe msae tue
sport of local political bosses.
The commission also urges tho adoption of
a new classification of the enstoms and the
postal service and a modification of the
rales, so that the number of excepted places
and of places subject to non-competitive ex
amination may be greatly reduced in all
branches of tne service. The commission
thinks that the exceptions from examina
tion in any postofnee may properly bo
limited to tbe postmaster, assistant post
master, cashier, private secretary and per
haps superintendent of tho money order de
partment. In tho same way the number of
excepted places in the departments at
Washington should bo greatly roduced.
Very serious harm. in theirjudgment.iesults
from allowing the chleis of divisions to be
excepted from examination, and they think
that they should bo put under the general
rule ana be appointed by promotion from
within the sorviee.
Somo Retaliation Against Canada.
A bill introduced by Mr. Frye in the
Senate to-day smacks very strongly of re
taliation, and at the present time is of mora
than usual interest. It amends the laws
regulating the trausportation of goods by
declaring that no mercandise shall bo trans
ported from one part of the United States
to another part of the United States in a
vessol belonging wholly or in part to a sub
ject of any loreign power, and suoh trans
portation via auy foreign port shall be
deemed a violutlon of law. The sailing of
nnr foreign vessel from one United States
port to another is not prohibited provldod
no, merchandise other than that imported
In such vessel from a foreign port snail be
carried from one pore to another of the
United States. The bill provides that the
President may by proclamation suspend tbe
right of carrying merchandise in bond
through the United States provided lor
in the bill in case the Dominion of Canada
should at any time deprive the citizens
of tho United States of the uso of the canals
in tbe Dominion on terms of equality with
Canada, ns prufided in tbe twentv-seventn
article of the treaty of Washington. , It is
also provided --that in caso any export or
other duty continues to be levied on lumber
or-timberof any kind cue on that portion
of the American territory in the State of
Mine wateied by the Saint John and its
tributaries, and floated down that river to
the sea, where tbe same is shipped to the
United States from the Province of New
Brunswick, the President mny suspend all
rights of carrying so long as the export duty
is levied.
Third Party financial Theories.
The financial theories of the Third party
were elnphasizod to-day in a bill introduced
by Mr. Otis, of Kansas, having the volumin
ous title "To change our monetary system,
reduce interest, fix the unit of value, supply
the States with a circulating medium and
for other purposes." The bill is amendatory
to one introduced at the last session. It
flvA. tlinftAllQi-nd tlia unit Af .!. n A At-
u mo
oned in
the act shall bo absolute .upon its face and
not in tbe form of a, promise. All money
specified shall be fnll legal tender, provided
that fractional currency shall only be a
legal tender in sums to the amount of $5 in
any one transaction. In addition to tho pro
visions for f tea coin age in the previous bill
this measure piovides that the money paid
for the bullion in the Treasury shall ho
covered into the Treasury as a part or tho
'general reserve fund." Immediately upon
the passage of this act the Secretary of the
Tieasury is required to have' coined all the
gold and silver bullion in the hands of the
general Government for any purpose; and
to have prepared at as early a dato as pos
sible $1,500,000,000 of paper money; alf of
which gold, silver and paper money shall be
used to form part of the "general reserve
fund." The Secietarv of the Treasury is di
rected to prepare an amount or paper money
not to exceed in volume 50 per cent of the
assessed value of the real estate of the
United States us shown by the last census,
then be held in the generat Treasury as tne
"States Improvement fund," and only to he
paidiut upon the order of the respective
voovernois mid Secretaries of States. Any
State may avail itsoir of the provisions of
this act by Joint resolution 'oi tbe Legisla
ture, and the State is required to p.iy to the
United States an annual tax of 1 per oent on
all sums diawn and retained (luring each
year and to open and keep in operation an
exchange and general deposit department
at tho capltol of tho State.
A Worklngman's Protective Bin.
"A bill to protect "American 'Worklng
mon." is tho title of a measure Introduced In
tho House to-day by Representative Chip
man, of Michigan. According to its provis
ions no alien who is a non-reslaent of the
United States shall work at any meoh nnical
trado or in anv manual labor within the
borders of the United States.
Barter's New System, of Finance.
Mr. Harler, of Ohio, introduced a bill in
the House to-day that treats the financial
question In a new way. It provides for the
cessation of silver bullion purchases on
January 1, 1893, and for the sale o'f 100,000,000
ounces of silver for gold. Mr. Harter thinks
the continuance of silver, purchases would
only increase the ultimate enormous lossos
of the country growing ont or the act of 1878:
that these puichases were destroying confi
dence at home and nbroad and stand iu the
pathway of national prosperity to-day. The
cessation of these purchases ot silver would,
ho thinks, cause a icnewal of foreign pur
chases of American securities upon a large
scale and the repeal of tbe present law would
stare gold from Europe tonard America.
Another Investigation Demanded.
In the Senate, to-day, Mr. Vest offered a
resolution reciting allegations in tho public
press charging gross misconduct on tho
part of census 'employes, especially ofenu
pierators.ln.tho, Stato of .Missouri, who aro
said to havo taken lists of voters for parti
san use, and also charging that certain
clerks of the Census Bureau had been sent
to tho State ot Now TorK daring tho recent
election, to perform partisan service, and
directing an investigation of such charges
by the Bonate Committee on the Eleventh
Census.
Mr. Hale, Chairman ot the Census Com
mittee, eaidbo presumed there would be no
objection to the proposed investigation. He
could not help thinking that tho Senator
from Missouri Had been fed into offering the
resolution by what would be fouud to bo a
matter of no substance. The great Census
.Bureau had done an immense work with but
very little political bias.

The interest in the permanent exhibition
of the Art Society is evidently Increasing.
Three new picture were added to the col.
lection yesterday, and were the subject of
much admiring criticism, it Is, perhaps,
hardly understood, even now, by tbe pub
lic, that the permanent art gallery Is free.
Next Friday evenlnsfought tobe amemor
able one In the Shady Avenue Baptist
Church, as the Allegheny County Christian
Endeavorers are to hold one of their regular
quarterly open meetings there at that time.

not confine thrlr studies to their own coun
try, howover, but will learn all they can
about other countries, all of whom will send

Queen Victobia has set s sensible
fashion in pet dogs. The other day she gave

An English bride, the other day, set
useful example to the American girl who Is
abdut to prepare her bridal trousseau. She
had $300 with which to buy lior wedding
dress, but she saved $290 of the sum by
hiring a dress from a friend for $10. She
argued that it would be necessary to wear
the dress for only an hour or two. and why
should she spend so much money upon itt
It is a recognized fact that a wedding dress
is not of much use when tbe ceremony has
been performed, although It costs so mncli
money. There are plenty or young married
women who have their wedding drescs
safely put away, having never worn thorn
since the momontous day. If the brides of
tho. next year or so could be persuaded to
hire them, Instead of wasting their money
on newonei, the wives who have tho
dresses and the brides-elect who expect to
wear tlmm could each make money by the
transaction.

Tho fact ot the matter is that he has

Moro Canadian Newspapers Join the Move

Ottawa, Oar., Dec C.-5pecfaL-Every
day adds new names to the list of tho Cana

tical condition of the Dominion. A plagno
could not have made greater bavoo upon
tbe population than the inroads the demand
for independence or Political Union has
mado Into the ranks of the ultra-loyal Cans

The Algoma Herald, In speaking of tho
depopulation of Canada, said: '-There aro
over 1000,000 native Canadians In the United
States, an increase of 37 per cent In the
number of Canadians living in the United
States.in 10 years, whllo the population of
Canada in the samo period only Increased 11
per cent. This is the net result of 10 years'
experience or Tory and monopolist rulo in
Canada. What sense is there in spending
public money upon efforts to bring immi
grants from Europe Into Canada? More
people emigrated from Canada in the past
10 years than there nre Inhabitants in that
vast portion or the Dominion west of Lako
Superior, and our rulers propose. to continue
tne policy which is driving Canadians out
of their native land at the rate of 30.010 a
rear and to wnsto some more millions upon
a worthless immigration service."
Tbe Alzoma Pioneer, in discnsslng the sit
uation, says: "1 he time has come for think
ing men to speak, and probe the canker
which is sapping the rtrength and Jeopardiz
ing the life or tho Dominion. No one can
denv the fjtet that a strong currant Is annn-
