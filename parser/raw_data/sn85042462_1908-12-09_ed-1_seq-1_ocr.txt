Lightly indeed some of us aru using
the words "Merry Christinas." We
have used it so long that to many it
has become a mere stock phrase.
Of course It will be a merry Christ
mas for those who have friends an
homes and money in their pockets. It
always has been a merry day for such
fortunates, and why should it not be
so this year?
But in greeting loved ones wit
"Merry Christmas" let us remember
the thousands for whom the day is
anything but marry,
Only a Mockery
In hundreds of poverty-stricken
- homes the name is but a hollow mock
ery.
With the fathers and providers out
of work, the larders empty, the bot
toms out of the dinner buckets, the
children half clad and the chilled
nights, the poor mother jn despair at
the thought that the season so dear to
the hearts of the children must be
spent without any of the joys and
comforts synonymous with Christmas,
the outlook is cheerless.
This Is the common picture, and
where sickness is added, as it often is,
the situation Is that much worse.

cisions ever rendered, today affirmed
the lower court's ruling in the case of
the people against Daniel F. Meskil. a

ARCH-SLAYER KILLS GIRL
HE ABDUCTED; ENDS LIFE
Mexican Who Murdered Four Mem.
here of Sweetheart's Family and
Then Kidnaped Her Was
an Convict
TRINIDAD, Colo., Dec. B.—Maggie
Garcia. 18 ■ years old, and Francisco
Martinez, who was suspected of hav
ing murdered the four members of the
Garcia family, whose bodies were
found at their home last Friday night
with their heads having been split open
with an ax, were found dead yesterday
about twenty miles west of the Garcia
ranch in the extreme eastern part of
Las Animas county.
Both had been shot ln the head. Ap
parently Martinez had murdered the
girl and then committed suicide.
A posse located Martinez and the
girl Sunday night In a lonely canyon
and. a guard, was placed. ■
Finding escape cut off, Martinez
killed his companion, whom he had ab
ducted after murdering her parents,
and then blew out his own brains.
Martinez, who had no horses, had
forced the girl to walk with him to the
place where they were found.
Martinez, It has been ascertained,
was pardoned a year ago from the New
Mexico penitentiary at Santa Fe.
The quardruple murder at the ranch
and the abduction of the girl followed.
•- The members of the posse brought
the body of. Maggie Garcia to the house
where the other members of her family
had been murdered, but left Martinez'
body In Pentala canyon, where he
killed the girl and himself.
The condition of the ■ girl's body
proves beyond a doubt that she resist
ed the fiend to the last. Her clothing
was torn until it hung In rags; her
body was cut and bruised ln dozens of
places, and even her shoes were torn
and cut until blood marked her trail.
It was the crimson footprints of the
girl which marked the trail tor the
pursuers and led them at last to the
two bodies which marked th.. end of
the chase.

BLOODY BATTLE
WITH FANATICS
RELIGIOUS RIOT IN KANSAS
CITY FATAL TO FOUR
OVER 100 SHOTS EXCHANGED
NEAR CITY HALL
One Patrolman Killed Outright and
Two Others Dying Abduction
Cause of Melee in Heart
of the City
[By Associated PrMi.l \
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec. B.—ln the
shadow of the city hall in this
city, and less than a half mile
from the business center, a riot in
which religious fanatics and police
were the participants, and in which a
hundred shots were fired this after
noon, resulted in the death of a police
man, a girl 13 years old and the fatal
injury of three and slight injuries to
two other poisons.
The dead:
ALBKRT O. DAI-BOW, a patrolman.
LOTTA PRATT, aged 13 years.
Fatally injured:
John Sharp, known as "Adam God,"
a street preacher.
Michael Mullane, policeman.
Patrick Clark, a police sergeant.
Slightly Injured:
Harry E. Stege, policeman.
George M. Holt, probation officer.
Trouble Starts in Crowd
The trouble occurred at 4 o'clock in
the afternoon, when the streets were
crowded with .persons.
While the battle was In progress the
participants traversed an entire block,
the final stages of the fight being en
acted directly across the street from
an entrance to the police station.
George M. Holt, probation officer of
the juvenile court, and a pioneer in
the work of saving boys from the
streets in this city, went to Fifth and
Main streets to investigate a case of
alleged abduction which had reached
him.
Near that street corner he came upon
Sharp, who, surrounded by his com
panions, was exhorting a crowd of
street loafers.
With Sharp were A. J. Selzer, a
woman and Aye children. The chil
dren ranged in age from 3 to 14 years.
Th. officer's suspicions were aroused
by the manner in which the woman at
tempted to secure money contributions
from the crowd, and he decided that
she and her male companions were not
proper persons to have the custody of
young children.
Woman Is Questioned
Officer Holt accosted the woman and
Inquired as to the identity of the chil
dren.
The woman replied sharply that the
officer "had better attend to his own
business."
"Adam God," whose long, flowing
white beard and hair gave him the ap
pearance of a patriarch, threatened the
officer with physical violence.
Officer Holt never goes armed; and
he found himself at a decided disad
vantage when the so-called preacher
and his companions displayed re
volvers.
He stood his ground, however, and
"Adam God" struck him a heavy blow
behind the ear, making an ugly wound,
with his revolver.
Holt started for the police station for
assistance, and as he moved away the
preacher tried to shoot him, but Sharp
was so excited he dropped his revolver
as he attempted to draw it, and when
he picked, it up and snapped it at the
officer the cartridge failed to explode.
Police Are Warned
Officer Holt rushed into the police
station and warned the officers to pre
pare for trouble. '
The police sergeant ordered Patrol
men Dalbow and Stege to go out and
arrest Sharp and his followers.
The religionists • were within fifty
yards of the police station when the
officers stepped Into the street. They
served notice they would "preach right
under the eaves of the police station,"
and the police could not prevent them.
The officers were not prepared for
the volley of bullets that met them al
most immediately after they appeared
on the scene. '.
Dalbow was instantly killed, and a
bullet passed through Stege's arm.
Other officers rushed out into the
street and a general battle ensued;
but the officers were unable to shoot
without endangering the lives of'other
persons.
Clark was shot In the eye, and Pa
trolman Mullane was shot ln the back.
' Riot Call Sounded
In the meantime a riot call had been
sounded and policemen were appear
ing from all directions.
. The officers crowded .in on Sharp
and his followers, firing as they went,
but taking great care not to injure any
of the children, and when the firing
ceased "Adam God" lay fatally wound
ed, shot through the head and body.
The woman and some of the children
escaped and fled to a houseboat, where
they lived, on the river.
Woman Defies Officers
The policefifty in numberfol
lowed. The woman barricaded herself
in the houseboat, where she defied the
officers.
Standing on the porch of the boat
with a shotgut she shouted to the
officers:
"Come on, you fiends!"
The boat was but a few feet from
the bank, and several officers, taking
up the woman's challenge, dashed for
ward. 1 • 5 "
The woman dropped her weapon and
taking two of the children ran back of
the boat, cut loose the boat and began
to row toward the middle of the Mis
souri river.
The officers called to her to stop,
but she only plied her oars more vig-
orously.
Without another warning the police
fired a volley at the boat. One of the
shots struck Lota Pratt, aged 13 years,
tearing away the ! greater part of the
child's face. She died from her wounds
tonight.
The woman then surrendered. She
said her name, was Mrs. Pratt and that
she was the wife of the companion of
"Adam ■ God" and the mother of the
wounded child.

JAMES GALLAGHER
SEVERELY GRILLED
BY RULE'S LAWYER
Prosecution in San Francisco's Fa.
mous Graft Case Charges Per.
' jury, on Which Appeal
May Be Made
[By ,' Associated Press.]
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. B.— merci
less arraignment of James L. Gal
lagher and Andrew M. Wilson, the
chief witnesses for the prosecution in
the trial of Abraham Ruef on an In
dictment for bribery, characterised the
opening portion of Henry Ach's ad
dress tor the defense today.
Acting under the orders of the court,
the police' confined the number of spec
tators to the capacity of the court
room. There Is every Indication that
the case, which has now lasted over 100
days, will go to the Jury late tomorrow
afternoon.
In the course of his remarks Mr. Ach
said: "I do not know that the eyes of
the people of the United States, of
California, or of San Francisco are
upon your verdict, nor, for the pur
poses of this case, do you.
"If you were to be handed the peti
tion of 50,000 people, demanding that
you' return a verdict within twenty
four hours or have your home and
your Utle ones burned, you would be
able to appreciate the position of coun
sel for the defense. You owe the peo
plo nothing more than obedience to the
law."
The speaker charged that the prose
cution was actuated by the personal
ambitions of Francis J. Heney and
Rudolph Spreckels,'whom he said were
willing "to, ride Into power over the
dead body of Abraham Ruef."
He advised the Jury strongly against
the influence of public clamor.
"Mr. Heney was too able an advo
cate to permit the extensive cross-ex
amination of Gallagher, and he was
wise not to permit the defense to un
cover the souls of such men as Gal
lagher and . Wilson. Gallagher, the
master mind, rotund,- well fed, well
educated, aspiring to a place on the
bench where he could review the de
cisions of men like Judge Lnwlor, noth
ing more than a limb of the prosecu
tion—why, a parrot could do as well
after the ten lessons that Gallagher has
had in public, to say nothing; of the
coaching he has had from Burns and
Spreckels.
"And Wilson, after he had testified
five times, when he had found that
the Immunity contracts were a delusion
and a snare, when his testimony did
not meet the views.of Heney and the
district attorney, when he had been
three times Indicted, when he had a
term of forty-two years in the peniten
tiary hanging over him, when he found
that the lion's maw could not be fliled
with what he knew, then ho changed
his testimony; then he fell In line. :
Mr. Acn declared Gallagher and Wil
son still enjoyed the fruits of the brib
eries In liiili they admitted being en
gaged, and said the only reason they
had not refunded the thousands of dol
lars they had taken was that nobody
had asked them to do so.

WASHINGTON, Dec. B.—lnterest In
both houses of congress centered
today In the president's message.
Senator Aldrich, on behalf of the
senate committee, and Representative
Payne for the house committee, ap
pointed to notify the president that the
two bodies were In session. Informed
their respective houses that they had
performed their duty and each re
ported the president had responded
with a statement he would immediately
submit a message in writing.
Secretary I_atta then appeared with
the message, appearing first in the sen
ate and then in the house. A-A^
The reading of the message began in
the senate at 12:15, and In the house a
few minutes later.
The galleries of both houses were
well fliled. All senators and representa
tives were supplied with printed copies
of the message, which contained an
elaborate appendix, accompanied by
numerous Illustrations showing the re
sults of the work of the forestry
bureau. .
Senators and members gave compar
atively little attention to the reading
of the message, " but most of them
busied themselves with the printed
copies before them.
Emergency Army Bill
An emergency volunteer army meas
ure was adopted, also submitted to
congress today, and the draft of the
bill accompanying the message was in
troduced in the senate by Mr. Cullom. j
The president says the bill is intended
to replace the present law, which was
placed on the statute books "plecer
meal and hurriedly, partly on the eve
of the war with Spain and partly after
hostilities had actually commenced.'" -.-.
After declaring the present law to he
faulty and ""wholly "inadequate to a
speedy and proper organization of a
volunteer force, the president says the
bill proposed, which was drawn under
supervision of the chief of staff of the
army, has the hearty approval of the
war department. The message says
further:
"It Is designed to afford the complete
machinery by which, should we be con
fronted with a foreign war, the execu
tive power could proceed at once to
transform enthusiastic and patriotic
citizens Into efficient and organized
soldiers. ■.;••■
"Happily tjiere Is at present no cloud
upon our horizon, but that very fact
affords us the best opportunity to pro
ceed with deliberation and care in the
preparation of laws adequate and In
dispensable for our possible war needs."
: ■ --_____r*^__F-_i__r;-_pn
Bill Is Elastic ' ,
The proposed bill is elastic: under
its provisions a force of 2,000,000 men
could be raised as well as one of 50,
--000.
Soreno E. Poyne today introduced a
bill to amend the Internal revenue act
by which It is proposed to place a
revenue tax on bay rum Imported from
Porto Rico.
Several Important amendments to.
the Hepburn railroad rate law wero
proposed in bills Introduced by Repre
sentative Townsend of Michigan, one
of the most active advocates of reme
dial legislation along interstate com
merce lines.
He would have the law declare that
In case the shipper designates no route
the lowest published rate between the
points of origin and of destination
should apply. .. - ■<-•'' .
Another amendment provides that
the carriers shall quote rates In writ
ing upon application and give the rates
upon bills of lading, and that the rates
be reckoned thereon. In the event
that error Is made ln these rates, It Is
provided that claims for recovery shall
be made only through the Interstate
commerce commission.
While the house committee on naval
affairs has not given formal considera
tion to the proposed Increase in the
navy, it was learned today that the
members of the committee stand prac
tically the same as last winter, when
an authorization for two battleships
was made. That the committee will
vote down the proposition of President
Roosevelt for four battleships is now
indicated.
The President's Message
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
The financial standing of the nation at the
present time la excellent, and the financial
management of the nation's Interests by the
government during the- lust seven years has -
shown the most satisfactory results. But
our currency system Is Imperfect, and llt Is
earnestly to be hoped that the currency com
mission will be able to propose a thoroughly
good system which will do away with the
existing defects.
During the period from July 1. 1901, to Sep
