With IhlsYilTecominpnd the fol
lowing rep$twn"ini;.articles amendatory
-, la the constitution of the United States.
Wkl- - "?es?ll,e4 Dylhe Senate and Houseof
Representatives of the United States 4 of
America wuongress assembled, iwonuirus
tj of pjJiT Houses 'concurring. That tbefoi-
ult JV?mp articles be, proposed to the Legis-
latui es or conventions of the several States
a amendments to the Uonstitauon, or tne
United States. t AH, or any of which ar
jonicles; when ratified by three fdurtbs of the
said-Xegislatures or conventions, to be
valid as par tbr parts of the said constitu
te Oion, namely: "
Jl Article .Every State wherein slavery
now exists which shall abolish the same
WhfereiWWahy time or time before the 1st
day of January, in the year of Our Lord
'iriiP0'0 shall receive compensation from the
United'iStareBin-bonds, bearing inter-
- est at J he, ate , for each slave shown
to have been therein by the eighth census
tl . jof'lhe United .States, said bonds to-be de-
Jieied to such States by .installments, or
..jin one parcel, at the completion of the
abolishment, accordingly as the same shall
have.beea'gradual or at one time within
'such "Stales ; and interest shall begin to
" Tiinjipon any such bonds only from the
proper time of its delivery aferesaid and
H afterwards' "Any State having received
bonds as aforesaid.and afterwards introdu-
sp rciiigortoleraing slavery, shall refund
fjfT to the Unjted States" the bonds so received
or the' value Thereof, and all interest paid
j -ihereon., (
1 il4ri!cle .AH. slaves who shall have
retijoyed actual freedom by the chances of
" xfhe war, atv any time before the end of the
rebejfibn, are forever free; but all owners
of such who shall not have been disloyal
shall-be compensated for them at the same
rateVasis provided for States adopting
' tibolishmeBt of slavery, but in such a way
that no ela'e shallbe twice accounted for.
. "A:ticle . Cougress may appropriate
money or otherwise provide for the coloni
sation of free colored persons iviui tueir own
consent at any place or places within the
United Slates-'1
.3-1 beg indulgence to discuss these pro
posed articles at some length. Without
4cr slavery the rebellion would never have
exieteJ. Without slavery it could not
s continue. Among the friends of the Un
ion there i3 great diversity of sentiment
. and policy in regard to slavery and the
'African race amongst us. Some would abol
ishfit suddenly and without compensa
tion ; some would remove the free people
fronius, and some would retain them with
us ; and there are yet other minor diversi-
3& ies.i" Because of these diversities, we
waste mut.h strength in struggles amongst
P ourselves. I3y mutual concession we could
harmonize and "act together. This would
be a compromise among the friends, and
not with the enemies of the Union. The
articles are intended to embody a plan of
such mutual concession. If the plan shall
' rhe adopted, it is assumed that emancipa-
l k tion will follow at least in several of the
States.
(Concluded next week.)
s- President's Message. To the exclu
sion of news and editorial matter we pub-
lish to-day the larger and most important
'portion of the President's annual message.
It is a plain, straightforward document,
such as we might expect from our Honest
. and worthy Executive. Interesting and
impsrtanc as these state papers always are,
oAhould be, in times of peace and pros
perity, it should in this the country's
darkest hour merit the attention of every
patriot and well wisher of his country.
t" ' We learn that on last Friday night,
T Wek, .the wheat stacks of Wm. Thomp
son and A. J. Palmer, twelve.miles below
".hereon the Blue, were burned, supposed
,.vLJy. an incendiary. The stacks were the
result or growth of eighteen acres, and
rprobably contained some three hundred
bushels of wheat. We hope the wretch
that perpetrated the deed will be ferreted
ourand dealt by as sueh conduct deserves.
