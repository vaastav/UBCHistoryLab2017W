A remarkable and unusual feature
It is said that there is a movement
on foot in several Florida counties
to finance pig clubs. Our recollec

which have made such a phenomenal
success, started out on the individ

of the department of agriculture,
and no special financing was needed,

equally attractive proposition and
would seem to need as little financ

of Greece. In Greece only the king

I. is field marshall not only of
Greece, but of Prussia as well.
Foi his age. General Lousmanis
has made rapid strides to arrive at
the supreme effective command of
the army of 66,00'J men in time of
peac r.nd, roughly, :)."0,UU0 men in
time nf war. He was born on Aug.
0, Greek calendar Sept . 2 our
calendar 18GI, on the island of
Cor'u. lie has been a professional
solditr all his life, graduating from
the military school and entering the
regular army at once as a second
lieu'rnant in 1883, where he had a
rapid rise in the engineer branch of
the service.
When the disastrous war with
Turkey was undertaken in 1897,
Dousmanis had already been a cap
tain seven years. He was attached
to the general staff of the then
Crown Prince, now the king. As
much below medium stature as the
king is above average height, as
dark ap the king is blonde, as silent
and unsmiling as the king is expan- ,
sive and genial, the two were in
great contrast, though General
Dousmanis is seven years older than
his sovereign. Throughout that war
and the long years that followed in
which Prince Conatantine planned
and effected the regeneration of the
Greek army, Dousmanis was his
right hand man. They shared and
still share the same admiration for
or belief in the Prussian system, and
despite the training of the Greek
army as a whole by a French mili
tary mission, King Constantine and
his chief of staff have succeeded in

putting upon the officers of the army
i. thoroughly Prussian stamp.
During the successful war against
the Ottoman empire in 1012 the then
Mentenant-Colonel Dousmanis w:?
;!gain attached to the staff of
Crown Prince Constintine and when
the latter became v he was made
chief of the general staff, a post
which lie held through the war
aeainst Bulgaria and has held since.
Tn addition, he was also his sov
ereign's aide-de-ramp in the war and
he tells a story which the king him
self confirms that the two were with
the young Crown Prince George
watching the battle of Kilkieh from
l ehincl a cemetery wall when a rifle
bullet struck the cold wrist watch
on Prince George's arm, clipping the
watch neatly and smashing it be
yond repair, though not even leav
ing a scratch on the prince's wrist.
Both the king and his chief of staff
believe in being where they can see
what is eoing on in c battle.
Speaking of the honors which
have from time to time been be
stowed upon him, it is characteristic
of General Dousmanis that he could
only remember two that he is com
mander of the Order of the Savior
a Greek order and wears the grand
cordon of the Crown of Prussia.
