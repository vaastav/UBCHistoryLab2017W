Mr. Liebbe said:
"The first thing to do is to eliminate the hot air furnaces. "What

The Examiner's "A. Mutt" cartoons

The attempt of the assassination of

All this niggests another line of

this kind? Hearst and his yellow sheets
are successful because the people sup
port them. The most reputable firms
in Chicago, New York and San Fran

Textbooks and the Farmers^
(Chicago Journal.)
Investigation by The Journal of the
school book situation has disclosed that
the city dweller is not the only victim
of extortion by the publishers.
The graft extends into every school
district in Illinois, and the farmer who
iends his children to the country school
is frequently the heaviest contributor
to tho rapacity of the trust.
City and country have an equal in
terest In obtaining a square deal for
their children. It Is only by united ac
tion that the grip of this monopoly on
tho educational system of the state
can be broken.
The rural school district is at the
mercy of the octopus. The children
must have books, and they must take
them at the prices fixed by the pub
lishers or go without.

'Ll&i
Chicago is leading In a campaign
that will result In more reasonable
prices for textbooks In Its schools. Its
aation creates an opportunity for the
smaller, cities and the rural districts
of which they should be prompt to take
advantage.
The state should be a unit in the
demand for cheaper books. The peo
ple should insist that a text book that
Is sold In Indiana or Kansas for 30
cents shall he sold for 30 cents in Il
linois.
Legislation that will make this de
effective thruout the state Is a
duty the incoming legislature can not
well disregard. It Is ono subject, at
lenst. on which members from Chicago
and those from the state should be
able to act in absolute harmony.

Some times he would tie a. string

and other times he had the list writ

Meanwhile the farmer talked' with a
