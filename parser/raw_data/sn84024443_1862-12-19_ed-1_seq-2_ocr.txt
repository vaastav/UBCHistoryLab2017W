the Federals under Burnside and a por

cording to the latest reports, resulted in
favor of the Confederates, though the
engagement does not seem to have been
general and decisive, and another great
battle may occur upon the same ground
at any moment. The carnage was heavy
on both sides. All the particulars to
hand up to the hour of going to press
will be found in our columns.

the impossibility of overruning, seizing

thrilling news from that quarter may

The Battle of Fredericksburg.
From tbe Lynchburg Republican, Saturday.
From the Examiner of yesterday we
obtain the following epitome of all the
intelligence received at the War Depart
ment ftom Fredericksburg in the shape
of official dispatches up to a late hour
Thursday night.
The dispatches of Gen. Lee relate that
the fight began at Fredericksburg at 5
o'clock in the morning. At that hour
the enemy attempted the passage of the
Rappahannock at three different points
by means of pontoon bridges. At two
points they were repulsed. At the third
it is presumed that that they eftected a
passage, as the dispatches stated tlint. tl.0
it. Lhad pot under cover of their cuns and
could not be.interruptedin their construc
tion of a bridge. -At last accounts, dated
about noon, the fight, was progressing on
the Southern side of the Rappahannock.
FARTHER PARTICULARS, INCIDENTS, AC.
It is understood that the point at which
pahannock was at Deep Run, about two
miles below Fredericksburg. The Yan
kees are said to have secured a landing
there on a low cape, and our guns wre
in a position to sweep their ranks on their
reacmns tne table land extending to
wards Fredericksburg.
The passenger train which reached
Richmond Thursday evening left its sta
tion three miles this side ot Fredericks
burg, about half past 1 o'clock in the af
ternoon, nd brought a number of per
sons who profess to have close and minute
observations of the morning's part of the

pouring in deadly showers ot grape, to
have filled the air withthe legs, arms and
disjointed membei-sof the Yankees.
When thehre was opened on our lines,
several hundred women and children
were remaining within the limits ot Fred
ericksburg, and their consternation is said
to have been most pitiful. We liuvefrom
different sources, the report that two wo
men were certainly killed by the enemy's
fire. We could not obtain the names of
the unhappy victims.
From the best information we can ob
tain it appears that Longstreet's division
was the portion of our force actively en
gaged yesterday.
The general conclusions from what we
learn up to the hour of writing, are, that
the enemy had enected a passage ot the
Rappahannock, probably in considerable
force; that the action of Thursday was
without any important fruits or prefatory
to a more important action now impend
ing; and that to-day Friday will witness
a large and important, but perhaps inde
cisive battle on the disputed lines of Fred
ericksburg. LATER ACCOUNTS.
Through passengers who arrived here
Thursday night from Fredericksburg, we
learn that simultaneous with his attempt
to throw his pontoon bridges across the
Rappahannock, the enemy bombarded
the town. The few inhabitants still re
maining there began to leave immediate
ly, and make their way towards Hamilton
Station on the railway. A number of
houses in the town were struck, and two
of them, Mr. JohnC. King's near the de
pot, and a Mr. Scott's were burned. One
of the church steeples was also struck
and some say knocked down. The num
ber of casualties to citizens are variously
stated. Some accounts say that only one
man, Jacob Grptz, was killed, and anoth
er wounded. But persons who were
anion c the last to leave the town, report
plished a flank movement, capturing 3.000
of the enemy, but this is not generally re
ceived with credit. "
. A soldier of A. P. Hill's division savs
Oi.e enemy charged our men in their rifle
pits and entrenchments nine times, and
wre repulsed with terrible slaughter, un
til our ammunition gave out, when our
Wen were again charged in overwhelming
force and driven back. But having ob-'
tained. more ammunition, our forces in
their turn charged the enemy and drove
liiern from the works in great disorder,
taking a large number of prisoners.
Johnson's, Crenshaw's, Purcell's and
the 1st and 3d Companies of Richmond
Howitzers, were in the fight. Two guns
of the latter battery having been struck
by the 6hot of the enemy, were taken
from the field in a disordered state.
' The Whig furnishes the following ac
count: " Accounts from the battle field are very
meagre. Passengers and wounded sol
diers could tell but little more than that
we repulsed the enemy on every side.
It is stated that the battle commenced at
or near Hamilton's Crossing, some four
"miles this side of Fredericksburg, and
extended along a line of two or three
miles. The forces of Gens. Ldngstreet
and Hill were probably engaged at an
early period of the fight. The Yankees
came up to the attack in immense force.
but encountered an army more brave and
determined, if not so numerous. The
fire of our troops told with excellent ef
fect, and the artillery kept up an inces
rsant discharge, until the enemy wavered

. It is reported that a thousand Yankees
were taken . prisoners on Saturday, and
that on Friday night l wo of bur regiments

and bagged six hundred as they crossed
the river. .
We learn, at a late hour last night,
that the shell which killed Gen. Cobb al

this command that fought the bloody en
gagement on the environs of the town,

successive assaults or tne enemy wnu
great slaughter. Gen. Cobb fell insight

After the xankees were ariven oacK
on everv side, their batteries across the
river opened upon our troops and kept
up a fierce cannonade for some time.
The town of Fredericksburg is in ruins,
from the effect of shot and shell.
Passensrers last evening reported that

ty for savinu that there was no general
battle. Heavy skirmishing was kept up
during the day. An ambulance train ar
rived about 8 o'clock lastnisiht with some
two or three hundred wounded, none of
them seriously.
We have heard various statements as
to the losses on Saturday. It is believed
that ours will not exceed 500 killed and
2,500 wounded, while that of the enemy
is far ereater. It is currently reported
that the Federal General Hooker is killed

revolvers stuck in their holsters, dashed
luriously through the streets, and enter
ed the ground north of the Presidenfs
bouse. At the steps in fiont of the door,
and under the archway, was a carriage.
The officer, or one of the officers of the
mounted guard, alighted and entered the
house. In about ten minutes he appear
ed at the door, and giving the signal, tbe
carriage door was opened, the guards put
themselves in martial attitude, commands
were given, and then the President ap
peared with a portfolio under his arm,
and with one or more soldiers at each
side walked rapidly to the cairiageand
entered it. Two officers jumped in iilso,
the door was shimmed, the guard gallop
ed into position, and the carriage contain
ing the President of the United States,
was driven off, preceded by troopers, fol
lowed by troopers. At a very rapid pace
the party left the ground, and uiion

Confederate Bonds in England.
The subjoined statement has an air of
truth about it. There are no more shrewd
set of capitalists than the operators on
the English stock Exchange. If a de
mand for Confederate bonds has arisen
in England, it is a sure premonition of
Southern independence. The money in
stincts of the English dealer in stocks are
scarcely ever at fault. The Mobile Reg
ister says:
We have seen a letter from a convales
cent Mobile soldier, who is soiourninsr in
the family of a hospitable citizen of Rich
mond, a wealthy capitalist, which gives
the particulars of a conversation he re
cently had with his host.
The gentleman, in the course of his in
quiries as to the means of remitting a con
siderable sum to England, was introduced,
to an English gentleman now in this
country on a collecting tour, for one of
the largest English hardware establish-
which, he is a nartwj. He has
collected upwards of a miri Mm&ta in
Confederate eight per cent. boois at par,
which he says will now sell readily in En
gland at 75 to 90 cents in the dollar, and
the day the Confederacy" is recognized as
a nation they will go up-to 125 or 150.
Many large houses, he says, have hun
dreds of thousands of dollars of these
bonds, and consider them a splendid in
vestment. As to recognition. it is sure to
take place in a few months.
Tnquiiies being made respecting the
Confederate navy reported to be building
in England, the gentleman saw mat Dom
ing certain was known. It is a fact, how
ever, that a good many large steamers are
building, but tor what purpose no
can tell. The ship yards are kept locked

Is
Slavery the Cause of Disunion
and. the "War?
We find the following very sensible ed
itorial in the New York Herald, of Wednes
day, the 3d instant:
There is one point in the President's
Message in which it is very clear that Mr.
Lincoln is entirely mistaken, and that is,
that slavery is the cause of disunion and
the war, and that, till the cause is abolish
ed, the effects will continue to exist.
If negro slavery is the cause of the war,
why did it not produce war for the last
eighty years? This institution prevailed
in every State in the Union at the found
ation of the Government, and is recogniz
ed and protected by the Constitution.
To say that it is the cause of the war is,
therefore, a grave error. The cause of the
war is the anti-slavery propagandism
which has sprung up at the North within
the last thirty years. By its proceedings
and its threatentngs it has given the se
cessionists an excuse for their revolt, and
has enabled them to seduce from their al
legiance to the Federal Government the
great body of the Southern people. So
far from Southern slavery being a cause
of war and disunion, it would have been
a bond of union and peace if the fanatic
al Abolitionists had let it alone; for its
toleration by the Northern States, as the
Constitution provided, would be the
strongest kind of inducement to the
South to remain in the Union. In the
event of the separation, the chances of
the preservation of the institution would
not be so good among other reasons, be
cause the fugitive slaves would not be re
turned. Abolish slavery, and the South,
therefore, has no great controlling mo
tive to contirfue its connexion with the
North. Negro slavery produces Cotton
in great abundance, as it could not be pro
duced under any other system; and the
South being wholly an agricultural coun
try, and the Eastern States chiefly manu
facturing, the interests of both sections
were mutual. -To attempt an inroad up-
tlxe Siouthevn system of labor is to destroy-
the reciprocity and the bahrceof in- -terests
by which the whole country has
hitherto prospered. Gen. Phelps classes
'property" and slayery together, as stand
ing in the way of human progress, and it
would be just as sensible to wage war
against the Catholic Church as against
the-domestic institutions of the South.
Alabama Shinplasters. -The
State ofGeorgia is flooded with un
lawful issues of shinplasters by parties in
Alabama. We have no doubt that there
are millions of worthless issues now afloat,
in the hands of the people which will nev

lature of that State, at its recent session,
passed an aot to suppress the issue and
