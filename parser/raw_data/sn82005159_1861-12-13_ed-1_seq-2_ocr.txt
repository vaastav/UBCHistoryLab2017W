ring his long life the nation ins not been un
mindful of bis merit, yet on calling to mind how
faithfully and brilliantly he has seived the
country, from a time far lack in our history,
when feu of the now living bad been born, and
henceforward continually, I cannot but think
we are still his debtors. J submit, therefore,
for your consideration—what further mark ol
recognition is due to him and to ourselves as a
grateful people. With the retirement of Gen
eral Scoit came the Executive duly of appoint
ing in his stead a general-in-chief of the Army
It is a fortunate circumstance that neither in
council or country was there so far as known
any difference of opinion as to the proper per
son to be selected. The retiring chief repeat
edly expressed his judgment in favor of Genetal
McCiellan for the position, and in this the na
tion seemed to give a unanimous concurrence.
The designation ol General McCiellan is, there
fore, in a considerable degree the selection of
the country, as well as of the Executive, and
hence there is better reason to hope |he will be
given him the confidence and cordial support
thus bv fair implication promised and without
which be cannot with so full efficiency serve
the country. It has been said that one bad
Geneial is better than two good ones, and the
saying is ttue if taken to mean no more than
that an army is belter directed by a single mind
though inferior, than by two superior ones at
variance and cross purposes with each other,
and the same is true in all joint operations,
wherein those engaged can have none but a
common end in view, and can differ only as to
the choice ot means. In a stoim at sea, no one
on board can wish the ship to sink, and yet,
notfimfrequently all go down together, because
too many will direct, and no single mind can
be allowed to control it.
Every day continues to develop that the in
surrection is largely, it not exclusively, a war
upon the first principles of popular government,
the rights of the people. Conclusive t-vidence
of this is found in the most gr3ve and maturely
considered public documents, as well as in the
general tone of the insurgents. In those docu
ments, we find the abridgement of the existing
light of suffrage and the denial to the people of
all right to paiticipate in the selection of public
officers, except the legislature, boldly advoca
ted with labored arguments to prove that large
control ol the people in the government is ihe
source of all political evil. Alonarchy itseif is
sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from
the power of the people. In the present posi
tion, 1 could scarcely be justified were I to omit
raising a warning voice against this approach
of returning despotism.
It is not needed, nor fitting, here, ihat a gen
eral argument should be made in favor of pop
ular institutions, but there is one point, with
its connection, not so hackneyed as most others
to which I ask a brief alttention. It i 3 the ef
fort to place capital on an equal footing with,
if not above labor, in the structure of govern
ment. It is presumed that labor is available
only in connection with capital ; that nobody
labois unless somebody else owning capital,
somehow, by the use of it, induces hirr. to la
fior. This assumed, it is next considered wheth
er it is best that capital shall hire laborers, and
thus induce them to work by their own consent,
or buy them and drive them to it without their
consent. Having proceeded so far, it is natu
rally concluded '.hat all laborers are either hired
laboiers or what we call slaves: and further,
it is assumed that whoever is once a hired iabor
"r W' 'between capi
ta! and labor as assumed, nor is there any such
thing as a free man being fixed lor life in the
condition of a hired laborer.
Both these assumptions are false, and all in
ferences from them are groundless. Labor is
prior to and independent of capital. Capital is
only the fruits of labor, and could never havp
existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is
the superior of capital, and deserves much the
higher consideration. Capital has its rights,
which are as worthy of protection as any other
rights ; nor is it denied that there is, and prob
ably always will,be a relaiionbotween labor and
capital producing mutual benefits. The error
is in assuming that the whole laboring commu
nity exists within that relation. A lew men
own capital and that few would labor them
selves, and with their capital hire or buy an
othei tew to labor for them. A large majority
belong to i.either class; neither work for others
nor having others working for them. In most
of the southern stales a majority of the people
of all colors are neither slaves nor masters,
while in the northern a large majority are nei
ther hirers nor hired. Men,with their families,
wives, sons and daughters, work for themselves
on their farms, in their houses and in their
shops, taking the whole product to themselves,
and asking no favors of capital on the one band
nor of hired laborers on the other. It is not
forgotten that a considerable number of persons
mingle their own labor with capital, that is
they labor with their own hands and also buy
or hire others to labor lor them.
No principle slated is disturbed by the exis
tence of this class. Again, as has already been
aid, there is not, of necessity, any such thin?
as the free hired laborer being fixed to that con
dition for life. Many independent men every
where in these States a few years back :n their
lives were hired laborers. The prudent penni
less beginner in the world labors for wages
awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools
or land for himself, then labors on his own ac
count another while, and a< length hires anoth
er new beginner to help him. "This is the just
and generous and prosperous system which
opens the way to all—gives hope to' all and
consequent energy and progress to all. No men
living are more worthy to be trusted than those
who toil up from pqveity, none less inclined to
t3ke or touch aught which they have not hon
estly earned. Let them beware of surrender
ing a political power which they already pos
sess, and which, if surrendered, w ill surely be
used lo close the door of advancement against
such as they, land to fix. new disabilities and
burdens upon them till all ol liberty shall be
lost. *
From the first faking our National Census
to the last, are seventy years, and we fina our
population at the end of the period eight times
as great as it was at ihe beginning. The increase
of those other things which men deemed desi
rable, has been even greater. We thus have
at one view what the popular principle applied
to government through the machinery of the
States and the Union has produced in a given
time, and also what, if firmly maintained, it
pi onuses for the future. There are already
among us those who, if ihe Union be preserved,
will live to see it contain two hundred and fif
ty millions. \l ith a fehaoce on Providence,
all the more firm and earnest, let us proceed
tn the great task which event? have devolved
upon us. ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

Wood! Wood! Wood!— Subscribers who have
contracted with us to bring wood, are hereby no
tified that we are in need of the article, now, and
must have it soon, or we cannot take it at all.
[Gr*The report of a battle between 3,000
Unionists under Parson Brownlow, and a body
of Secessionists at Monislown, Tennessee, in
which the latter were represented as having
been routed, is contradicted.
President's Message.
Sensible people have some cause for gratula
tior. in the tone of the first Annual message of
President Lincoln. True,it does not come up to
that standard of statesmanship which character
ized the State papers of the illustrious past, and
it is not emphatic and decisive against those
extreme measu r es deprecated by all who hold
moderate and reasonable views, still its recom
mendations are not fanatical, nor even radical,
and it holds the balance quite even between
the conservative and revolutionary puties of
the North. So tar as the Message goes, it la
better than anything we had expected from a
man who so frequently and boldly avowed his
sympathy with Abolition. Contrasted with the
views recently expressed by Air. Cameron, Mr.
Trumbull and other leading " Republicans,'" the
Message apppars moderate, indeed. It is plain
that Mr. Lincoln has repented of his sins on the
slavery question. He has had an overdose of
the medicine prepared by himself and DR. SEW
ARD for the purgation of the American Repub
lic. He is evidently no longer ot the opinion
.that " this Union cannot permanently endure
half free and half slave!" He begins to
think that it need not " become all one thing,
or all ihe other!" He is convinced that
slave labor can flourish where climatic causes
operate almost totally in its favor, and that it
is not wholly incompatible with the employ
ments of free men under the same form, of gov
ernment. Mr. Lincoln's conversion to the
Democratic theory on this subject, was, doubt
less, made under great tribulation of mind and
much against the w ill of the President; but it
was inevitable. The calls of inexorable duty
haunted him continually, and, dreadful as was ;
u^) mtmmmy tucu 'miu w*e Hit? Of 1
(hat beloved Chicago Platform. Whether be !
will be able, finally, lo get his feet fairly upon
the lock of the Constitution, remains to be seen: i
but one thing is certain, viz: the President is j
now walking in the right path,having turned his '
back upon those abolition advisers who would
have chaos come again through the broken
flood-gales of Southern slavery. We shall,
therefore, not complain on account of some
things in the Message, which, in our humble
opinion, had better been omitted, nor because
the President did not see fit to touch upon top
ics which seem to us of vital interest to the A
merican people. We can afford to overlook
the conciliatory hints to the Abolitionists, and
even to lorego the satisfaction we would have
experienced in reading a convincing justifica
tion of the seizure and imprisonment of citizens
! of loyal States, without process of law, and the
forcible suppression of newspapers which chose
to differ from the Administration in the settle
ment of our National troubles. In short we do
not find fault with the Message, because the
" time is out of joint." and every thing else is
" fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils."
Practical Abolitionism.
Notwithstanding the apparent hostility of the
| President and a majority of the Cabinet to the
! barbarous proposition to arm the slave? and em-
I ploy them in the pillage and murder of their
j masters, we find the Abolition element in Con
| gress, headed by Thaddeus Stevens, Owen Love
'joy, Lyman Trumbull and other hot-headed
I fools, striving with all their might, to rush
through Congress a law declaring the freedom
of four million negroes held in bondage by reb
el masters, and when freed, to place in their
j hands the weapons of war and elevate them to
.the level of the Union soldier. Already the
! Crittenden resolution, which was adopted by
the last Congress to set forth the objects of the
war, has been repudiated by a deliberate vole
of the House. Even our own member, MR.
M'PHERSON, who heretofore generally voted
with the conservatives, has gone over to the
ultra Abolitionists, and voted to lay on the table
j the motion to re-affirm the Crittenden resolution.
• Now, how in the name ol all that is reasona
ble, can this benefit the Union cause I Will it
I make the Border States firmer ? Will it win
lus battles' Will it strengthen our treasury?
Will it render us more secure in our lives and
property ? Alas ! no. An act to emancipate
the slaves, will either fall still-born upon the
negroes of the South, or it will hurl them upon
the North fur maintenance and support. It
will either be a dead letter, or it will affect the
Union men of the South as seriously as the Se
cessionists. Rapine, plunder and desolation
will certainly follow the passaged such an act.
i Even were it possible to colonize the slaves in
a foreign region, the sudd-n uprooting of a so
cial system which has grown with our growth
and strengthened with our itrenglh,would prove
the source of inconceivable disaster. We shall,
therefore, oppose in the future (as we have in
I the past) the designs of the Abolitionists. We
shall oppose every thing that may have a ten
dency to bring about the results they desire.—
Be it in lime of war or in time ol peace, four
millions of helpless, ignorant Africans shall
not be cast upon Northern society, if our hum
ble efforts can prevent it.

Correspondence of the Philadelphia Inquirer.
IMPORTANT ABOUT THF, REPORT OF THE
SECRETARY OF WAR.
Last Thursday, Gen. CAMERON completed his
report and sent it to the printers without sub
mitting it to (he inspection of any one. On
Sunday last it was completed, and proofs fell
into the hands ol Gov. SEWARD. He became
very much alarmed, and on Mondav morning a
Cabinet council vyas called and the President's 1
Messag'e, which had been completed on Sunday
night, was also brought up.
After a lengthy discussion it was concluded
to keep the Message back until Tuesday, and
further consider the question. At another
meeting on Monday SEWARD secured
an interpolation of his ideas in the President's
Message, verbatim, and the President's matter
was cut out. Arranged in this way it was sent
in to Congress on Tuesday.
In the meantime, Geneial CAMERON was ask
ed to change or moderate his report. He re/u
--sed, and up to eleven o'clock P. M., Tuesday, it
was thought to be inevitable that either General
CAMERON or Governor SEWARD must leave the
Cabinet, and an entire recast be made.
The President finally settled it by going to
General CAMERON and insisting upon his con
fining hi 3 report to a statement of the past, and
not dictate to Congress what they should do!
CAMERON insisted "hat his policy was correct,
and must be carried out at once. The President
| assured him that it did not follow, it he chang
ed his report or left out any of it, that he must
necessarily change his policy, but that he could
carry it out ; only let Congress take hold of ttu
matter first. With this understanding, General
CAMERON made an aheiation, which we tele
graphed you afier midnight.
Secretaries WELLES and OILASB both si Jul
with General CAMERON ; but WELLES would
not make any fizht on it, and "would leave it
to the President." CHASE, also, would not
stand up to the fight, and CAMERON consequent
ly, at the last moment, modified it. In the
meantime, it only remains for the Senate and
House to dictate what shall be done.

THIRTY-SEVENTH CONGRESS-FIRST SES
SION.
WASHINGTON, Dec.s.
SENATE. —In the Senate Mr. Rice (Minn.)
asked leave to record his vote on the expulsion
of Breckinridge, as he was absent yesterday.
Leave being granted, he voted yea.
Mr. Sumner (Mss.) offered a resolution to
print 10,000 extra copies of the President's
Message and accompanying documents. Re
ferred to the Committee on Printing.
Mr. Sumner presented the petition of citi
zens of Haverhill, Mass., that the slaves of reb
els be liberated unconditional!}', and the slaves
of Union men on fair payment.
Mr. Chandler (Mich.) offered a resolution to
appoint a committee of thrpe to inquire into tne
disasters at Bull's Run and Edwards Ferry.
Mr. Lane (Kansas) moved to amend and in
sert Springfield, Wilson's Creek, and Lexington.
Mr. Chandler hoped that the resolution
would not be amended.
Mr. Lane said that a man entitled to honor
perished at Wilson Creek, and p n rished because
he was not relieved when he could have been.
The people want to know why the gallant Ly
on was sacrificed? Why regiments were sent
to Cairo instead of to the relief of Gen. Lyon,
and whythe army moved at a snail's pace to
reinforce Mulligan? The people warded namps,
and, in his opinion, would not have to look tar
for the man who permitted the sacrifice of Gen.
Lyon.
Mr. Lane's amendment was not agreed to.
Mr. Grimes offered a substitute, to appoint
a committee of two members of the Senate, and
three membeis of the House, to investigate the
causes of all the disasters to our arms.
On motion of Mr. Fessenden, the subject was
posponed till to-morrow.
Mr. Wilson (Iowa) moved to take up the
resolution to investigate the case of Colonel
Miles. He said that the court ol inquiry found
that Colonel Miles was intoxicated to a certain
extent, enougri to justify Colonel Richardson lo
apply the epithet to him, but not enough to
remove him from his command. He wanted
all the facts of the case vo goto the people.
The resolution was agreed to.
Mr. Trumbull (III.) introduced Ins bill for
confiscating properly and giving freedom to
the slaves of rebels.
He said the bill provides for the absolute
and complete forfeiture, forever, to the United
States ot every species ot property, real or per
sonal; wherever situated within the United
States, belonging to persons beyond the juris
diction of the United States, or beyond the
reach of civil process, in the ordinary mode of
sent rebellion, who during Us existence shall
take up arms against the United State?, or in
any wise aid or abet the rebellion. This forfeit
ure to be enforced against property in the rebel
lious districts through the military power, and
against property in otherjportions ol the United
States, in which the judicial power is nut ob
structed by the rebellion, through the individ
ual seized and forfeited, be subject to the just
claims of loyal creditors, to be held for the ben
efit of loyal citizens despoiled of property by
the rebellion, and to defray expenses incurrtd
in its suppression.
The bill also forfeits the claim of all rebels. 1
and those who give them aid aud comfort, to i
the persons they hold in slavery— declares the '
slaves thus forfeited, free, and makes it the du
ty of the President to provide for the coloniza- j
tion of such as may be willing to go to some
tropical country, where Ihev may have the
protection ol the Government, and be secured
in all the rights and privileges ol freemen.
The propeny belonging to traitors or those giv
ing them aid or comfort, who imj be convicted
by judicial tribunals, to be forteited on their
conviction. The real estate for life and the
personal property forever.
Mr. Trumbull argued at some length in sup
port ot 'he bill.
The bill was ordered to be'printed and referr
ed to the Committee on the Judiciary.
Mr. Clark (N. II.) gave notice that hp
should offer an amendment to the Fugitive J
Slave hill.
The Senate then went into executive sessian,
and subsequently adjourned until Monday.

Mr. Gurlev (Ohio) offered a resolution, 1
which was adopted, requesting the committee
on fhe Judiciary lo inquire it a censorship of
the press had been established in this city, and
if so, bv whose authority, and by whom it is
now controlled, and report if such censorsnip
has not been used to restrain wholesome politi- !

Mr. Stevens (Pa.) submitted a seties of res

Mr. Arnold (III.) moved that (he part rela

debated whether it should be thus referred, or
to the Committee on Military Affairs. It was
contended on one side that the great West and
Northwest should not be ignored, and on the
other side, that the subject of defence concern
ed not a section, but the entire country.
The question was finally referred to a select

The resolutions of Mr. Stevens, as thus amen

MAND.
* BALTIMORE, Dec. G.
A despatch from Savannah in the Rich

; says:
j "Sixteen of the ships of the enemy are now j
• inside the bar and an attack on Fort Pulaski/
is hourly expected."
j The Richmond Despatch ol yesterday says
i that it is currently reported that Genera! Floyd's :
; command has been ordered to another impor

| REBEL MOVEMENTS IN MISSOURI,
i Our lalest advices from the South are that
: Gen. Price has moved a part of his force fntu '
■ Osceola, to a point five miles distant, where he j
i has established his headquarters. Gen. Rains'
j command remained at Osceola.
A train of fitly wagons from Lexington, laden i
with supplies for general Price's aimy, passed ■
(unmolested within fiifteen mil s of this place
!on Monday last.
Th°re are four regular recruiting offices in
1 Lexington enlisting recruits fir G-n. Price's
| army. A meeting was field there last Friday,
: at which several prominent secessionist spoke,,
| urging a united effort in •behall of the rebels.!
j Similar meetings have been held in Clay, Ray
; and other river countirs and subscriptions for
1 money, clothing, fee., are in circulation.
ft is not, perhaps, generally known, but it is
j believed lobe a fact that Saline County, Claib
! Jackson's residence, in Ju 1 v list, authorized
the Commissioners to raise $109,000 to be ex
pended for the benefiit of GPO. Price's army.
Other counties along the Missouri River are
believed to have done the same thing.
It is stated on good authority that when
Price was besieging Lexington a delegation of
citizens was rent to him (torn Saline county
with an urgent request thai he would not al
j low his army to eater that county, which was
I complied with. The reason of this request was
because of the great fear entertained by the in
habitants of the county of the plundering pro- !
j pensities of Price's rebels.
The counties along the Missouri River, west
of Jeffi-rson Ci'.y, are the -richest in the State,;
; and have furnished nearly as many men and j
!as much means in behalf of the rebellion as ■
i the balance of the State. They '.save been al
! most entirely exempt from marauders, and have j
■ never been visited by Federal troops.
FRANKFORT, Dec. 6. I

; Several letters from Somerset and Stanford, I
j dated the sth inst., hare just been received.!
j They s.av that the Federal forces under Gen

' of Somerset, and the rebels, 10,000 strong, have
crossed Cumberland liver, and are marching on
Somerset. Men. woman and children are
leaving Somerset in every possible conveyance,
and rushing into Stanford.
The Stanfoid people think that Gen. Schmlf
should be reinforced, and the Democrat editor
ially thinks that Gen. SchmfT's purpose in fal
ling back on Somerset is to catch Zoliicofler in
a trap.
The Commercial's Frankfort dispatch says
the conduct of the P resident in modifying Sec
i retary Cameron's report, and the confidence
j which is placed in Generals McClellan, Btiell
and Halleclr, aie having influence to calm the

STH'ER.-On the 19th N'o*., John Wesley,
sou of David and Mary Stiver, of Bedford town
ship. He was born January 24, 1547, and wis
therefore not quite fifteen years old, when rsll
e<l away from earth by' the stroke of death.
Many interesting traits of character had al
ready exhibited t heir embryo forms in the brief
history ot this lovejv boy; and the fond pa
rents, as well as numerous friends, had watch
ed these buddings ot hope with the deepest so
licitude and interest, and had looked forward
to their beautiful expansion in coming man
hood, with lire most cheering anticipations.
But, alas ! this bud of promise has, in the mys
terious, yet ever gracious, providence of '. id,
failed of expansion, at least on earth. And
yet, it blooms still : not indeed in the domestic
enclosure, but in the Eden above, where it shall
blossom and flourish forevpr.
A father's hand is in this blow,
His love illumes our night,
And though a stream has ceased to flow*,
The fountain's still in sight. S. K.
