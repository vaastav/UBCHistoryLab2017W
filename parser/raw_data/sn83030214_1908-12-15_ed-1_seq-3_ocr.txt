BERLIN CHEERS CASTRO.
Croud Greets Him at Station —
Message to the Kaiser.
Berlin. Dec 14--Pa^sident Castro of Venezuela
and th« memberc of his party arrived here thia
evening. The train was awaited at the Zoologi
cal Garden Station, on the outskirts of the city,
by a dense crowd, which had gathered out of
curiosity. Xo precautions had been taken to
prevent the public from crowding the platforms.
The President was greeted with shouts of "Long
live Castro!" Hats were raised and there was
much cheering.
The Venezuelan charge d'affaires at Berlin.
Senor Veloz-Goiticoa. Sefior Nachod, consul at
Berlin, and other prominent Venezuelans had
difficulty in reaching the car where Castro was
standing waiting to descend. The President,
although he looked like a sick man. was full of
energy. He wore a gray soft hat and black
overcoat. He stepped out quickly and embraced
Peftors Veloz and Xachod. The consul read a
Fhort address of welcome, and the President
was apparently about to reply when another
train dashed in at the opposite platform, the
noise preventing his effort to speak.
Furwier cheering broke out as the President's
wife and the fifteen other members of his party
left the train. They then left the station and
found, drawn up outside, several motor cars
decorated with Venezuelan flags. In these they
drove to the Hotel Esplanade, where thirty -two
rooms had be-en engaged, followed by a number
of nrivare motor cars and cana containing new=

" tag that he had come to 'Wmany for
meiiical treatment, and expressing profound
liomage to his majesty. According to the samp
authority, when Castro wap informed of the
capture of the A!ix i Alexipi by the Dutch criiiser
CJ*>lderland he was not greatly affected, merely
rvmarking- that there was no such vessel in the
Venezuelan Bet vice.
No arrang«nifnts have been made for < "astro

TREATIES WITH CANADA
GOOD PROGRESS MADE.
Secretary Root and Ambassador
Brrjce Conducting Kegdtiatiom.
I From The Tribune Bureau "
Washington. Dec. 14.— Secretary of State
and the British Ambassador have resumed the
negotiations, broken off last April, whfch have
to do with the- submission to The Ha?u<" of the
Newfoundland fisheries question and with the
disposition of power, etc., in the boun lary
waters between the United States and Canada,
and with certain pecuniary claims. »
The treaty, technically called' a compromise,
which defines the scope of the question to be
submitted to The Hague for arbitration, is al
most completed.
Considerable progress has been made on the
boundary waters treaty. Secretary Root having
devised a method of meeting the desire of the
Canadians for the establishment of a perma
nent .commission to settle the distribution of
power and other controversies which, it is be
lieved, will meet with the approval of the Senate.
This will probably b«=- accomplished by laying
down, in the creative treaty, certain principles
for the guidance of the commission, which, by
the way. is to be composed of one jurist and one
<-xpen from each of the contracting govern
ments. This win in effect place such limitations
on the powers of the commission as will m^et
the objection raised by Mr. Root last spring
that such a commission as was proposed, would
be endowed with treaty-making power. It La
further proposed bo t,o frame the treaty as to
render all previous decisions' and agreem*
an additional restriction, at least In principle.
Thus hedged about it is not believed that the
powers of the commigpJon will be so extensive
as to encounter the disapproval of the Senate..
THE HOUSE RILES FIGHT.
"Insurgents" Discuss Changes To
Be Recommended To-night.
[From The Tribune Bureau. |
- Washington. Dec. 14 -Colonel Hepburn'= commit
tee of Inanrtrents" against the House rules, at its
nrst meeting T..-day discuaaed the changes which
will be recommended to-morrow night, when a sec
ond meeting will be held. No definite propositions
were agreed on. but it was practically decided tnat
•he Speaker's power of recognition must be cur
tailed and the Rules Committee elected by the
House. Rule 14, " which provides that "when any
member desires to speak or deliver any matter
to the House be shall rise and address himself to
Mr. Speaker, and on being recognized, address the
House." will probably be amended by the ' in
surgents" by striking out the words "being recog
nized by the Speaker." This, they contend, would
work a change which could not fail to make the
mlea more equitable.
It is predicted by the Speaker's friends that the
fight will result in nothing. The Speaker's posit on
end that of his supporters is that the present ru es
are the evolution of twenty-five years of legislative
experience. The constant drift has been toward
making the m more stringent in order that tile ob
structive tactics of the minority may be dim n
ished as much m possible. It la also pointed cut
by the Speaker's friends that the present rulus
have survived -• eral changes in the political com
plexion of the HmiMQ and that thosi in the opposi*
tion have not had sufficient legislative experience
to judge what the real result of a change wouid le.
To the'suggestion that th? Committee on Rules be
ejected bj the majority of the House the answer is
lliadi that the effect would not be particularly de
sirable, because the great states of New York,
Pennt>yivania and Illinois, v.hich are represented
by the largest egations, would practically dictate
the choice of the House.

Of Congress, next Saturday. To this end Charles
M. Schwab, president of the Bethlehem Bteel Com-,

was learned to-day that he haß been •apscsi re
quested to bring exact flsurea as to the cost of steel
products in this country, so that a comparison may
be made with the foreign prices. Andrew Carnegie
is expected by members of the committee to appear
before the end of the week, and Invitations have
also been, sent to William E. Corey and E. H.
Gary, although Representative Payne declines to
disclose the order in which they are to appear.
Some complaint has been heard by members of
the committee against the secrecy with which the
recent meetings of that body have -en conducted,
especially *ith regard to the summoning of wit

that there are some things which It is better to

POSTAL BANKS CHANCES.
Senator Carter Pushing Bill — Its
Prospects Not Bright.
IFrcrn The Tribune Bureau. l
Washington, Dec. 14.— Postal Savings Bank
bill, which had been made the regular order fo.
to-day, was compelled to p,<> over until to-morrow
as a result of the time devoted in the Senate to
the Brownsville message and debate. Senator Car
tcr. in charge of the measure, gave notice, how
ever, that to-morrow he would move to mal ins
bit] the "unri'nNhe.i business" until disposed of.
Senator Carter is much in earnest in his desire
to have this measure become ■« law at this session.
and he has the backing of more than 'tne member
of the Finance Committee] as well as of a majority
of the Republican members of the Senate. Never
theless, the prospects for the bill cannot be re
garded a.« bright. There are certain influential
Senators who are det»rmin.'d that the bill shall
not be seriously considered at this session, and
some- of the Democrats seem to be determined to
play into their hands by utilizing tae. dilatory tac
tics possible under the Senate rules, especially at
a short session.
Senator Aldrlch informed the President-elect
that It was the wish of the Monetary Commission
to postpone action on this measure until the gen
era! plan for iip organization of tin currency anJ
the banking system Is taken up in the first session
of the 61st Congress. Tills plan does not ai al.
please Senator Carter and Senator Hopkins, the lat
ter a member of the Monetary Briasion. and
they are dubious as to the fate of the measure If
so postponed. The course of the bill, therefore,
will be watcßea with much interest, and may re
solve itself into a duel of wits between its advo
cates and opponents.

a conference of the representatives of labor to m«t [
'in Washington early in January Xo consider The
question "f the unemployed and other matters of I
Importance relating to the worklngman's cause. The
conference Is 'he natural sequence of the meeting
of the National Council of Commerce whl h con
vened on invitation of Secretary Straus- last week
and was atten>l»*<! by representatives of flftv-twn |
business organizations. At that meeting ways and j
means for Improving commerce **r» discussed.
At the labor meeting the side of the employe ,
will be heard, and Secretary Straus expects that th*
gathering will be the first of many to be held at the
capital for the same purpose.
Next in Importance to the question of the unem
ployed, the conference or council of labor will take
up the matter of misdirected Immigration. Accord
ing to Secretary Strauss annual report, recently
published, the immigration this year was 48 per cent
of that,of last year.
"This \e> moat concrete proof."'«a:d the Secretary
to-day, "that a large percentage of Immigrants
are brought here under false pretence? of some port.
The only way this state of things caa be bettered
is by the diffusion of. information in other countries
through L'nited States consular officers, to correct
the false Impression given out r.v steamship agents
and others as to the state of labor In the United
States.
• - I intend further to coilSUtt the labor l U|ll USBIitSr
tives as to the advisability of extending the ICgVia
tions of the steamship inspection service to include
the Inspection of locomotive boftera used in fnter
state commerce. At pre«e,nt the federal authorities
'do not inspect locomotive boilers, although the lives
of thousands upon thoosaada of persona are de- ;
pendent daily on their stability. The terrible loss
of life among ra'iroad employes, as well aa among
railroad passengers, In this country makes it im
perative, it seems to me. that the federal govern
ment use all the means in its power to compel the
transportation companies to use first class boilers
on their locomotives, and not to allow their us?.
as, Is sometimes the case, until they become worn j
and rusted out and blow up from sheer senile de
bility."
The <I<>tai;»d a/ranscements for the January labor j
meeting are in the hands of the labor men In the i
department, I>anlel J. Keefe, the new I'ommln

Some of th« officers eaid that criminals kao»n t^>
have no other means of livelihood were admitted t<s

handl-d by any one probation officer, yet some of
those on the stand yesterday had no knowledge of
whether their charges conducted themselves prop

once a week at the West Side court and t'r,» pa

that in most cases a man under parole was re-om

was undertaken.
