“Let Him Alone.” ,
“ C,” as if ashamed of the manly senti
ments expressed in The Democrat some
three weeks since, in favor of educating ,
tlie colored people, and which we com
mended as wise and liberal above his Je
shuitieal party, retracts, iu a measure, by
attempting to qualify and explain his rea
sons for tlie noble utterance. Ho says,
“ Let him alone, Democrat—tho negro be
longs to us.” Here is the fog in which the
Democracy arc bewildered. They cannot
comprehend the negro, except as property.
In fifteen States he was so long classed as
a chattel —a peculiar property having a
representative value iu Congress, which
was appropriated exclusively hy the Democ
racy, that it is not surprising its loss is felt
to ho a great deprivation. Nevertheless,
the fact has got through tho hair, finally,
that they own him no longer ; but another
equally important truth, that tho negro is
a free man, and in the language of our
Declaration of Independence, entitled to
“life, liberty, and tlie pursuit of happi
ness," does not yet seem to be fully com
prehended, even hy tlie most advanced
members of that party. Hence “C.” puts
tho following language into tlie mouth of
The Whig —“the negro belongs to us, —
and wc are abundantly able to take care of
him.”
AVe don’t propose, however, that the Re
publican party, as “ C.” intimates, shall
take care of tho colored man, hut believe
him “ abundantly able to take care ” of ,
himself, and “ say let him alone,” as wc ,
let every other man alone who has a white
skin; according to all alike the political
rights and privileges promised in the Decla
ration of Independence, as “self-evident"
truths and “ unalienable rights," to secure ;
which “ governments are instituted among
men.”
AA’e are charged with making the negro
our “main stock in trade ever since
father Abraham sent forth his hull of i
emancipation.” It would boa satisfaction
to know what has been the stock in trade
of the Democracy, not only since the ap- i
pcaraneo of father Abraham's bull, which i
gored the rebellion, and its parent, Democ- i
racy, to death, but long anterior to that i
event, if it lias not been the negro? Has
that party, for tlie last twenty-five years, i
made a political canvass, the most promi- i
neut issues of which did not embrace the i
“ negro question ?” and for the last eight i
years little else has been written about ar i
talked of by that party, but the negro ?
He was proclaimed the corner-stone of their i
proposed new government in the revolting i
States. And now, at this very hour, why i
do the whole party cling to the hope, like
drowning men to straws, that the Fifteenth .
Amendment will be defeated, if their po
litical salvation did not rest entirely on
keeping the colored man in a state of serf
dom ? AVe do not say, let him alone iu Ids
ignorance, but let him alone to enjoy the i
lilierty which is his “ unalienable right;”
and educate his children that they may be
wiser and better men, than that debris from
Europe which has long been used to fill up
the ranks of tie Democratic party, as they
become depleted hy education.
It has long been a favorite theme with
tho apostles of Democracy to decry the ig
norance of the negro, and “C.” in his
last article, imitates this bad example.—
He is not storked with book lore, we admit,
but there are other standards of intelli
gence than the A, B, C criterion. His his
tory, for eight years, has proven him, to
tlie prejudice of his traducers, to be far
above the brutes, as this charming Demo
cratic party constantly picture him.
The leaders of the rebellion found they
could not impose upon him, or deceive him,
when bis freedom was at stake. Since
then they have hob-nobbed with him, or
attempted it, to gain his vote : but he has
proved too intelligent to be duped by bis
former masters. His knowledge of politi
cal affairs, has made the negro proof against
both flattery and persecution, and when
not overpowered by force, lias steadily voted
against the men who held him in slavery,
and now seek to withhold the ballot from
him. Ho has steadily and consistently
voted just as tho most intelligent white
men would have voted if placed in similar '
circumstances. The Democracy have tried,
hut their success lias not been flattering, 1
to impose upon the negro with lies. Why ■
then does “ C.” say “wo can make him ;
believe any lie we choose ?”
AA'o agree, however, most heartily, with 1
“ C,” in urging upon tlie State tho duty of
educating the colored race, the rising gen
eration of whom are more exposed to temp
tation and vices than ever before. Every
child should be properly educated without
regard to color. Society reaps a hundred
fold hy it. If educated, and tho conflict of
color and race still maintains its hold on
the future generations, as an educated peo
ple they can separate. Tlie world is wide.
The educated colored man can carry the
civilisation and arts of the Anglo Saxon to
the untamed continent of his fathers. He
never can do it as an inferior, or ignorant
man.
Report of tlie Postmaster-General.
The first Report of Postmaster-General
freswell is conceded hy tlie press of tlie
country generally, to bo one of the ablest
ever coming from the Post-Office Depart
ment. Tlie firm stand taken by Mr. Cres
wcli to reform the abuse of tlie franking
privilege meets with universal approval;
and the remedy suggested to diffuse infor
mation among the people, of Government
affairs, which is now supposed to be accom
plished by distributing Public Documents
free, is eminently wise and practical. In
lieu of tlie franking privilege, which is
possessed by upwards of thirty thousand
Government officers at an estimated ex
pease of $1,000,000 annually to the Depart
ment, the Postmaster-General suggests that
newspapers be sent free to boifide subscri
bers from offices of publication. By the
means of free newspapers vastly more in
formation would be spread among the peo
ple than is at present covered hy official
franks. The amount of revenue derived
from postage on newspapers is $77,883,
which is proposed to bo given up in order
to stop tlie immense frauds growing out of
the franking privilege. AVhen the Post-
Office, is relieved of this incubus, which is
increasing yearly in weight, then a further
reduction of letter postage, it is probable
will bo found practicable, which cau never
, be hoped for while the present abuse of the
franking privileges continues.

What Has Hr come ol American Commerce 5
Tills question is suggested by the intima
tion contained by the Free Trade article of I
The Democrat of Saturday last, whore it is ’
charged by implication that the present 1
tariff is the cause of the present state of
American commerce. The writer says :
“Our commerce is languishing, our mer- 1
chant licet rotting in the docks. The :
American merchant ships were once the i
pride of our country, and their sails win- ,
tuned every sea, now the gallant sailor seeks
another dag, whilst the moth is eating his
own bunting.
The Committee on Commerce, appointed
to investigate and report the cause of this 1
deplorable calamity, have recently made 1
public the facts of their investigation, which 1
wore not that import duties on foreign 1
goods had driven it from the seas, but the '
British built and manned rebel corsairs, '
which under the encouragement and assist- I
ance of the aristocratic government of Eng
land, were protected in their piracy on the i
high seas, in capturing and burning de
fenceless merchantmen, sailing under the
United States flag. 1
It was not the numbers of ships wan- '
touly burned and destroyed by this pirati- 1
cal arrangement between the old enemy of
American commerce and the Rebel Confcd
oraoy ; but witli such freebooters as the :
Alabama roving the seas, merchants who I
shipped in American bottoms were unable 1
to procure insurance, without paying such i
enormous rates as would sink the entire i
profits of the cargo. And the consequence I
was that American vessels, to escape the
danger of being pounced upon in mid-ocean,
by these pirates, were transferred to British 1
protection, took out British papers and sail- 1
cd under the British flag. The American 1
commerce, which had been building up for ]
the greater part of a centuary, was hy this 1
foul alliance between the rebel leaders, and
the natural enemy of that commerce, driven 1
from the seas in four years. A commerce 1
like that of the United States before tbo <
war, cannot be re-established in a day or a ]
year. Another cause reported by the Com- 1
mittce is the high wages demanded by 1
American sailors above those of the British '
marines, serving at present to keep the |
freights of British vessels below those of
American shippers. These are the jirinie i
causes of the present state of our com
merce, clearly attributable to the madness
that ruled in the southern half of our conn- ]
try in 1800, and not the present tariff.— ’
And if the tariff on imports is high, it is i
the result of the debt caused by the self- 1
same war, which was the ruin of our com
merce, all brought about in tbo effort to 1
establish a dominion wboly dedicated to i
slavery.
This much we have thought it necessary
to say in reference to the decline of our .
merchant marine, in taking leave of the '■
editor pro tem. who during his brief instal- I
ment in the editorial chair of The Democrat, '
gave his readers plain, honest thoughts in i
strong Saxou words, in lieu of the hazy, <
labyrinthian rhetoric, on which they have
been refreshed so long. :
His theory of paying the public debt by <
direct taxation, wc fear would not find i
many friends among the farmers ; and those '
few would rapidly diminish after the first :
levy. To advocate paying our immense
puhlie debt hy direct taxation, is only a I
mild name for repudiation. It could not
be done.
i
CONGRESSIONAL.
The United States Senate was notin ses- ]
f ion on Saturday. In the House of Roprc- ]
sentatives a debate arose upon a motion to j
lay on tbo table Mr. Ingcrsull’s bill to au- i
tborize the issue of forty-fourrailliou dollars i
of legal tenders, the Secretary of the '
Treasury to purchase with them and cancel
gold interest bearing bonds. The motion
to lay the bill on the table failed by a vote
of 01 to 88. The bill was referred to the :
committee on Banking and Currency. A ,
resolution was adopted, requesting the i
Committee on AVays and Moans to report a
bill repealing the manufacturers’ tax on
provisions, and so explain the present law
as to relieve dealers from the interpretation .
placed upon it by the Commissioner of In- ,
temal Revenue. The Census bill was dis
cussed, but no important changes made.
In the United States Senate, on Monday,
Mr. Carpenter, from the Committee on the
Judiciary, reported a hill to perfect the re
construction of Georgia, providing for the
assembling of the Legislature as originally
elected, with no expulsion of members on
account of race or color, the exclusion of
all persons ineligible under the the Four
teenth Amendment, and that the provisions
of the act be enforced by the military and
naval power. The bill was laid over for
the present.
Mr. Drake called up bis bill prohibiting
the Supremo Court from jurisdiction upon
acts of Congress, and made an argument
upon it. Mr. Drake took the ground that 1
if the Court could pass judgement upon
and reverse an act of Congress it was prac
tically the highest power in the land, and 1
that the Constitution never intended but 1
that Congress should be the sole and su- '
preme legislative power.
In the House of Representatives Mr.
Butler introduced several bills for the ad
mission of Virginia, all of which were re
ferred to the Committee on Reconstruction.
Several bills to abolish the franking privi
lege were referred.
A message from the Secretary of State i
was received announcing that official no- I
tieo of the ratification of the Fifteenth :
Amendment had been received from twen- i
ty-ono States. The Census hill was then i
debated on the representation question up :
to the hour of adjournment. The House :
agreed to adjourn for the holidays from De- I
cember 22d to January Ith. •
On Tuesday, the session of the Senate
was devoted to tho official announcement
of the death of Senator Fessenden. '
Much of the time of the House was also 1
taken up with tho same subject. 1
Mr. Getz, of Pennsylvania, introduced a 1
resolution directing the Committee on AA'ays '
and Means to inquire into the expediency 1
of abolishing the office of Collector, As- 1
sessor and other agents of tho Internal
Revenue Bureau, and apportioning the
amount of taxes among the several States ,
to be collected by them. Referred to the
Committee on Ways and Means.
In the Senate, on AVcdnosday, ajmomor- j
ial from the National Colored Labor Con
vention, recently in session at AVasbingtoii, i
setting forth the necessity of Congress in- (
terfering to ameliorate tho condition j
of the laboring men of the South,
and asking Congress to divide the lands i
belonging to the Government in the South i
among tho colored men, was referred to ,
Committee on Public Lands. Senator i
Brownlow had read by tho Secretary a
statement relative to bis course in Tonnes- i
see politics. He defends bis support of
Senior and denounces Stokes. The lan
guage of bis paper became so personal and 1
abusive that Vice President Colfax objected i
to its reading, but at tbo request of other ,
Senators, the feeble condition of Mr. ■
Brownlow being urged as an excuse for his ’
conduct, the reading was proceeded with. '
In the House of Representatives, a rose- ]
lution calling for information in regard to i
the payment of tho reward for tho capture 1
of Jeff. Davis was adopted. Other rcsolu- 1
tions and new bills wore introduced and
referred to appropriate committees, and (
the Census bill was taken up. The consid- j
eration of the bill in Committee of the 1
Whole was concluded, it was reported to *
the House, and was debated until the hour ]
of adjournment. ,
Before the Footmots and Behind
the Scenes.— Wo have received from tlic
publishers, Messrs. Panneleo & Co., ad
vance sheets of a new book of the above
title, from the brilliant pen of Miss Olive
Logan, the former actress, and present lec
turer and author. An examination of the |
table of contents is such as to excite the
strongest interest, and awaken the greatest i
curiosity, to see the work. The subject
matter treats of that curious world, known
in the theatrical parlance as the “Show
World, - ’ and includes everything in the
shape of amusements that wo ever heard
of—oven to lectures, which are often, it
must be admitted, the reverse of amusing,
except when delivered by a Gough, or an [
Olive Logan—for Miss Logan, is a whole
entertainment in herself. It is a peculiarity
of this lady's writings, that, whatever else
they are, they are never dull. She is al
ways bright, witty, anil fascinating, when
speaking, or when writing.
This hook takes us into the secrets of the
“player folk’’—conducts us behind the
scenes of the Theatre—takes ns into the
dressing-room of the Circus—among the
caged animals of Menagerie—exhibits a
brilliant phantasmagoria of buffoons,
mountebanks, actors, actresses, operatic
artists, street tumblers, jugglers, wild- !
beast tamers, their public and private lives, |
habits, botli good and bad, and in short, is I
a veritable turning “ inside out ” of that
mysterious world concerning, which so lit- |
tie has hitherto been reliably known.
In the bands of an ordinary writer, this ,
book would suggest much that is danger- j
ous to road and introduce to the public; ,
but, Olive Logan, lias so nobly proved her !
love of good morals, and sound virtuous I
principles, that no one need fear that the |
tone of the book will be low.
No such work has ever been issued from !
the press in any ago or country. It is the :
only work of the kind in existence, and is
a work which no living person could have
produced better than Olive Logan. It is
the crowning achievement of her restless
genius, and the good it will do bo mind
can measure. Beautifully illustrated,
sparkling with anecdote and story, full of
sound common sense, and pure morality.
Wo publish on our first page, this week,
some extracts from the work.

of novelties offered in Dcmorcst's Monthly
would seem to be enough to secure a circu
lation sufficient to satisfy its publishers,
but in addition we sec they propose to give
a vary large and fine engraving to each sub
scriber, valued at $lO. The Engraving
alone would make a very appropriate Holi
day or Birthday gift; but when added to
the costly picture the best Parlor Magazine
is included, to he a monthly reminder of
the friendly feeling of the giver, there is
certainly no better way of investing $3. —

j —The Philadelphia Preen, in summing
! up the results of the late elections in Mis
sissippi and Texas, remarks, under the
head of “Southern Whites:”
The fact most gratifying in the Missis
sippi election is the large white vote thrown
for the whole Radical Republican ticket.—
Wc gather the following from the Missis
sippi papers just received :
In twenty-nine counties, with a majority
of white votes, the Republicans carry all
but three.
Tishomingo county, almost exclusively
white, votes Republican. Our gain there
over last, election is 1,524, and in Lee,
another white county, the gain is 1,340.
Iu Warren comity, where there arc over
eighteen hundred white votes. Judge Dent
got but 1,005 votes, proving that some 800
whites voted for Alcorn and the Republi
can ticket, or refused to vote against them.
The election was bloodless and peaceful;
the whole people seemed to he animated by
the determination to obey the law and finish
agitation. As the Yazoo Republican says,
speaking of the result in Yazoo county,
where the Republicans bad a majority of
over eighteen hundred, and a gain over the
last election of over fifteen hundred :
“ The colored voters have acted nobly,
as was expected ; but the most cheering
aspect of the conflict and victory is the fact
that the masses, in spite of the pressure of
party and its discipline, have risen in their
might to rebuke the last struggle of the
secession leaders in favor of the ‘Lost
Cause.’ ”
The majority of General Alcorn, the Re
publican candidate for Governor, will be
thirty thousand at least. Two-thirds of
the Legislature arc Radicals, and five Rad
icals are elected to Congress—Harris in the
First. Morphies in the Second, Barry in the
Third. McKee in the Fourth, and Force in
the Fifth District.
In Texas, where the election lasted four
days, the same peace and good-will are re
ported. Large numbers of whites voted
the Republican ticket. Here, as in Missis
sippi, tbe froedmea were solid, showing
that, where they have no protection, they
prefer their friends. The theory—based
upon the manner in which they have been
threatened and persecuted into voting the
Democratic ticket in Georgia—that they
would eventually he controlled by their
former masters, is completely refuted by
their solid unity iu Texas and Mississippi.
The value of these data is two-fold. The
whites of the South are finally satisfied
that there is uo resisting reconstruction,
and the Democrats of the North, who are
soon to see the colored men voting in their
midst, cannot resist an example so full of
wisdom.

—The latest sensation in New York is
the Ricliarclson-McFarland scandal. Henry
Ward Beecher and Horace Greeley have
got into it. The Rev. Beecher having olli
ciatcd at tlie death-bed marriage ol* Rich
ardson to Mrs. McFarland, his congrega
tion of Plimonth church, * c interviewed”
their pastor and mildly censured him.—
Greeley was “interviewed” by a corres
pondent in disguise, of the New York Sun,
who reported the philosopher of the Tri- i
bune as making use of some very emphatic
language, which moral folks designate as I
profane. Greeley came out in a caid de- 1
living the statement of the secret emissary '
of the /Sim, in reference to profanity, but
stating his approval of the marriage as (he
best thing that could have been dune under
the circumstances.
—Another great swindle has been perpe
trated in Wall Street, New York, by a
couple of brokers called Gray and Pratt,
who have altered United States and other
Bonds from SI,OOO to SIO,OOO and have,
with these altered bonds, swindled several
banking linns out of s'*oo,ooo or more. It (
is reported that the villainy of New York
sharpers and roughs has driven the more
honest citizens to self protection, by the
organization of a Vigilance Committee.—
Hanging to the lamp posts seem to be the
only remedy for New York morals.
—Attorney General Hoar was nominated
by the President to bean Associate Justice
of the United States. This appointment *
is made necessary by (he law of Congress i
creating an additional Judge of this Couit. 1
Attorney General Hoar’s successor has not
yet been made.
