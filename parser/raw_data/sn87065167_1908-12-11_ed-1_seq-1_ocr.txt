SHOT DOWN DY DENTIST
Tragedy is Said to Have Been Un
pi oYoked and Considerable
Excitement Prevails.
DR. PITTS, THE VICTIM,
WAS POPULAR CITIZEN
*>
Birdsong, the Slayer, Was Drinking
and Imagined That Pitts Was Inter
fering With His Business.—Old
Negro Only Eye Witness.
Hazlehurst, Miss., Dec. 11.—Great
excitement prevails here on account
of the sensational killing yesterday
v afternoon of Dr. A. B. Pitss, one of the
most prominent physicians in the
state, by Dr. Tom Birdsong, a dentist
who occupied an adjoining office on
the second floor of the Baas building,
over Pitts Bros.' drug store. #
The killing occurred In the office
of Dr. Pitts. Three shots were fired,
two of which took effect, the first in
the chest and the second in the groin,
the third gong wild. - Birdsong was
promptly arrested and placed In jail,
where he refuses to discuss the affair,
There was only one eye witness to
the shooting, a negro named William
Sumrall, who was in Dr. Pitts' office
when Birdsong came in, and who saw
the tragedy at close range. He was
placed in jail as a witness, after ma
king a statement to the effect that
Dr. Birdsong came into the office and
upbraided Dr. Pitts for not attending
to bis own buslpess and leaving that
of other people alone. Dr. Pitts made
some reply to the effect that he had
been attending to his own business,
and Birdsong left. In a few moments
he returned with a pistol and, stepping
between Dr. Pitts and the negro,
opened fire at close range, with the
above result. Death followed Im
mediately, and Dr. Pitts never spoke
after being shot.
It Is stated that back of the tragedy,
while there had been no previous dif
ficulty between the men, there was an
unpleasant feeling, due to the fact
that Birdsong was accustomed to
drinking a good deal of liquor and
bringing friends up Into his office,
where they would drink together,
became annoying to Dr. Pitts, who
was forced to submit to the humilia
tion of having his patients and other
callers witness scenes which were not
altogether pleasant, and be had either
remonstrated with Birdsong or spoken
of It to others who communicated It
to Birdsong.
Within a few minutes after the kill
ing probably 500 people had gathered,
and there were many threats Indulged.
Dr. Pitts being an unusually popular
man, both as a citizen and as a prac
ticing physician, standing high
among his patients, as well as among
the members of his profession
throughout the state.
Dr. Birdsong, while a member of a
splendid family, was a hard and al
most constant drinker, and had lost
much of bis professional prestige on
that account. He is a brother of Dr.
Jim Blrdson, husband of Mrs. Angle

most sensational trial, of the killing
of Dr. Butler at Monticello, where both
lived, and who was afterward par
doned before entering upon her pris
on sentence by Governor Vardaman.
He is about 45 years old, and has a
wife and five children.
Dr. Pitts was about 55 years old,
and has a wife and a large family, one
of whom, a young daughter, Is to be

Another Arrest.
Hazlehurst, Miss., Dec. 11.—Homer
Smith was placed under arrest, here
this morning as acessory to the kill
ing of Dr. A. B. Pitts by Dr. Tom Bird
song last night.
It is alleged that Smith loaned Bird
song the pistol used in the tragedy
with the full knowledge of what he
intended to use it for.
Sentiment againBt the slayer is very
bitter In the community and a demand
has been made for Judge Potter to
reconvene the grand jury and give
Birdsong a speedy trial.
After the tragedy Birdsong barri
caded himself in his office and defied
arrest, but friends interceded and he
was pursuaded to surrender.
In handling his pistol to the officer
who arrested him, Dr. Birdsong said:
"Well. I intended to do It and X have
done It."
TRADE DAY
Local Merchants Are Ready For
Big Day Which Has Been
Anxiously Awaited
Tomorrow, Saturday the 12th, the
much-talked of excursion over the Mis
sissippi Central will come Into Hat
tiesburg and there Is good reason for
believeing that many people along the
line of the Mississippi Central will
take advantage of the low rates of
fered to visit Hattiesburg.
Ail Indications, at this time, point
to the success of "Trade Day," and
the bargans that will be offered by
Hattiesburg merchants tomorrow will
be the greatest ever known, therefore
the excursionists will have the oppor
tunity of the season to buy goods at
a bargain. More than this, many peo
ple in and around Hattiesburg will
take advantage of the great bargains
offered for "Trade Day" and will do
a great deal of shopping.

Jackson, Dec. 11.—The supreme

docket, there being no cases for oral
argument and the only cases docketed
being submitted on briefs. There will

A TALK TO NEWS READERS
Probably from this time to Christ
mas Day the most Interesting news
In the News to a large majority of
Us readers will be contained In Its
advertlseing columns. There Is a pe
culiar condition In the trade world
just now. The panic of last year hit
the manufacturers harder than It did
any other class of people. The Hat
tiesburg merchants pretty well mark
eted their last year's stock of goods
and were able to buy during the past
spring and summer at very satisfac
tory prices. This means that there
Is a wide margin between the value
of the goods that they offer now and
their cost to the merchant and this
means that merchants are able to
offer big leaders to attract the public
to their stores.
Any one who imagines that there
mediate points will come on the regu
lar morning passenger train, buying
round trip tickets at one and one-third
fare for the round trip. When parties
have traded to the amount of 315 they
can take their cash checks to Secre
tary Larson at the Commercial Club,
and have the total amount of their
fare refunded.
A great many of the visitors will
attend the great Southern play "The
Traitor," tomorrow night at the au
ditorium and there will be a special
train wating to carry them home after
the play is over. Those who prefer
can go to the matinee tomorrow after
noon.
This is Hattiesburgs first concerted
effort to have a regular "Trade Day,"
and if it is the success that is hoped,
there will be many other similar oc
casions,

10 Per Ceni Penaliy
NEW ASSESSMENT IS
CAUSE OF THE DELAY
«
For This Reason MP.' Mapnuder Will
Give the Tax Payers All the Time
Possible to Liquidate Their Indebt
edness to County.
Sherlff Magruder was asked this
morning if it was his purpose to add
10 per cent to all taxes not paid be
fore December 15, and replied that it
was not, and a3 it had not been cus
tomary heretofore in this county, al
though the law allows it, he was at a
loss to understand how the idea got
out that additional cost would be
added after the 15th Inst. He has
never had the slightest intention of
doing this.
It wiir be remembered that owing
to the fact that a new assessment of
real property was made this year
that it was a month later than usual
when the books were ready for the tax
collector and tnis delay In starting
probably prevented some few from
paying early,
stances, it would hardly be right to
Impose additional cost on the tax
payers, and Sheriff Magruder is clear
ly In the right in the matter, besides
the fact that it has never been cus
tomary to add additional cost before
February 1, by which time all persons
must pay their taxes or become dis
franchised for two years.

Sheriffs Throughout the State Say
That Collections Are Good
This Year.
Jackson, Miss., Dec. 11.—Although
less than a week remains before the
fifteenth of December, the date fixed
by the statutes by which times taxes
must be paid to avoid the addition
of ten per cent damages, It Is conserv
atively estimated that less than one
third of the taxes assessed In Missis
sippi have been paid, and much less
than that has been paid into the state
treasury.
During the next few days, It the
usual custom prevails, there will be

a general rush to the offices of the
sheriffs and the municipal tax collect
ors, and probably half the taxes due
will have been paid in by the fifteenth,
the time to which the sheriffs have
had the limit for reporting collections
extended, in order that the pension
warrants, or as many of them as pos
sible, may be cashed and turned in
to the state treasury as cash.
Following this there will be a lull,
unless the tax collectors get behind
the tax payers and enforce collec
tion. After Christmas there will again
be a rush, and the collectors will be
very busy during January, due to the
fact that every man who has not
paid his taxes in full by Feb. 1, will
be disfranchised during the two years
following.
According to an official opinion is
sued a few days ago by Attorney Gen
eral Stirling, the tax collectors may
not collect ten per cent damages even
after Dec. 15, where the taxpayer vol
untarily pays his taxes, but only
where the sheriff takes Some legal
steps to make the collection, such as
levying on property, etc. This is con
trary to the understanding of the law
as interpreted by a number of sheriffs
and municipal tax collectors, as many
of them in the past have taxed those
damages onto the taxes atid collected
them together without any process at
ail.

Jackson. Dec. 11.—The frank ac

have been the cause of much comment
In political circles, and in some quart
ers has given rise to the fear that
Mississippi Is about to encounter an
other very protracted political cam
paign, with active canvassing a<#qally
in progress two years in advance of
the primary date.
In well-informed circles, however,
this theory is given but little credence,
nor is it believed that either ex-GoV

Frankness is S "tanWtWteUfi fif bottr
men, and, when asked by friends
cerning future political plans they
simply gave straightforward answers
instead of adopting the usual evasive
tactics of the politician who is not
ready to take the public Into their
confidence.
Furthermore, these published state
ments conveyed nothing new to any
person acquainted with matters
litlcal In Mississippi. It has been an
accepted belief ever since the cam
paign of 1907 that Vardaman would
make another race for the senate, with
Senator McLaurin as his opponent,
providing both are alive at that time,
and that Mr. Scott w-ould make a sec
ond effort to capture the governor
ship. Both of these men have political
following of formidable strength, both
have been earnestly urged by many
friends not to thrust aside their po
litical ambitions, and it is therefore
only natural that, in reply to direct
questions, they should give the public
the benefit of the truth.
The experience of the campaign of
1907, however, has undoubtedly taught
Messrs. Vardaman and Scott the folly
of protracted campaigns, and their
native sense and judgment, as well as
kindly consideration for the voters
whose support they will ask, will
cause them to wait until the proper
time before opening their canvasses.
I^ong campaigns are costly under Mis
sissippi's primary law, and they are
growing costlier with each succeeding
ccntest. Unless there is a curtailment
of the electioneering period, in 1911 It
will be Impossible for any man ot
moderate means to aspire to office.
