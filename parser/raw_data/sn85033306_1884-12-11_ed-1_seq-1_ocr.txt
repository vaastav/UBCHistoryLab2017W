THE MORMON QUESTION.
Report of the Utah Commission A Revival
In Polyiramy.
Washington, D C, December 3.
The report of the Utah Commission, ex
Secretary of War Ramsey chairman, was
made public yesterday. The commissiod
says that their duties have been faithfully
and successfully performed, with results
showing that at the recent election for
delegate to Cougress and other elections
of county officials, held under their su
pervision, all polygamists were excluded
from voting and holding office. The
Utah delegate-elect to Congress, Mr.
John T. Caine, is a Mormon, but he does
not now and never has lived in polygamy,
and Is therefore eligible tinder the law;
The report says that for a year of more,
after efforts to enforce the law were in
stituted, polygamic teachings from the
pulpit were rarely heard, and there were
observable indications that the nactice
of polygamy might measurably decline;
but during the present year there appears
to have been a polygamic revivali The
institution is boldly and defiantly defend
ed by spiritual teachers, and plural mar
riages are reported on the increase.
As an illustration of the oneness
6i faith among Mormons respecting
polygamy, attention is called to an im
portant polygamy case, recently tried iu
Salt Lake City, where every Mormon on
the jury panel, iu answer to the question
"Do you believe it right for a man to
have more than one living and undlvorced
wife at the same time?" answered unhes
itatingly, "Yes, sir."
The trial of this case caused a pro
found sensation throughout the Tent
tory. The defendant, Rudger Ciawson,
(the son of a Bishop), and his two
wives belonged to the better class of
Mormon society. Although bis polygamic
marriage had been notorious in the com
munity for months, no direct evidence of
it was disclosed until given by his
second wife after a short imprisons
ment for contempt of court for refus
ing to testify. All other witnesses exam
ined and there were many, including
the immediate relatives of the parties, the
President and other high officers of the
church, every one, except the second
wife, disclaimed all knowledge of the
marriage. Ciawson was convicted, and
before sentence was passed declared
judgment should not be passed against
him because the laws of his country were
in conflict with the laws of God. The
-Constitution, he said, expressly states
that Congress shall make no law respect
Ing the establishment of religion or pro
hibiting the free exercise of it. Polyga
mous marriage, he said, when sanctioned
by religious rites and ceremonies is the
establishment of religion, and the atiti
polygamy laws were designed to operate
against such marriages, and were there
fore unconstitutional. This view ex
pressed by Ciawson, the report says, is in
conformity with the uniform sentiment of
all the Mormon people; but while this is
their creed, many Mormons are reluctant
to enter into the polygamic relation, so
the trial and conviction of Ciawson will
probably have a restraining influence upon
young Mormons.
Tne commission urge a vigorous en
forcement of the present laws. the
Government has to deal with a people
wonderfully superstitious and fanatically
devoted to their religion; and a sudden
overthrow of polygamy as a result of the
enforcement of the present anti-polygamy
laws is not to be expected. They recom
mend additional legislation in the nature
of amendments to the existing laws,
which they think will greatly strengthen
the hands of both the commission and the
counts. They express the opinion that itis
not unlikely the Federal Government will
finally find it necessary to take into its
own hands all civil power in Utah.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The Last General Communication
of President Arthur to
Congress.
ABeview'of Our Domestic anl Foreign
Relations and of Our Mora
Pressing Needs.
The
President Expresses His Sense
of Obligation to All Parties
For Their SupporL
WASHINGTON, Ti. C, December 1.
iho thr Congress of the United States:
Since the close of your last session the
American people In "the exercise of their
highest right of suffrage have chosen their
Chief Magistrate for the four.'years ensuing.
When It is remembered that at ho period in the
country's history has the long political con
test which customarily precedes the day of the
National election been waged with grenter
fervor and intensity, it is a subject of con
gratulation that after the controversy at the
polls was over, and while the slight prepon
derance by which the issue had been deter
mined was as yet unascertained, the public
peace suffered no disttibrance, but the peo
ple every where patiently and quietly await
ed the result. Nothing could more striking
ly illustrate the temper of the American citi
zen, his love of order, and his loyalty to law.
Nothing could more signally demonstrate
the strength and wisdom of our political In
stitutions. THE ELECTORAL VOTE.
Eight years have passed since a con
troversy concerning the result of ft National
election slmrplv citHerl the attention of Con
gress to the necessity Of providing more
definite regulations for the counting of tho
electoral vote.
It is of the gravest importance thrtt this
question be solved before.- conflicting claims
to the Presidency shall again distress the
country, and I tun perstia led that by the
people at large any of the measures of relief
thus far proposed would be preferred to con
tinued inaction.
J FoUKHiN RELATIONS;
Our relations with all foreign powers con
tinue to be amicable. With Belgium a con
vention has been signed whereby. fbe scope
of the present treaties has been sb-fmlurged
as to secure to tne citizens oi enuev coumrv
within the jurisdiction of the other equal
rights and privileges. In the acquisition and
alienation of property a Trade mark treaty
has also been concluded. The war between
Chill and Peru is at an end. For the arbitra
tion of the claims of American citizens.who,
during its continuance, suffered through the
acts of the Chilian authorities, a convention
will soon be negotiated.
CHINA.
The state of hostilities bet ween France and
China continues to be an embarrassing
feature of our Kastern relations. The Chinese
Government has promptly adjusted and paid
the claims of American citizens, whose prop
erty was destroyed in the recent riots at
Canton. I renew the recommendation of my
last annual message, that the Canton in
demnity fund be returned to China. The
true interpretation of the teeent treaty With
that country, permitting the restriction of
Chinese immigration, is likely to be again
the subject of 'your deliberations. It may be
seriously questioned whether the statute
passed at the last session does not violate
the treaty rights of certain Chinese who left
this country with return certificates valid
under the old law nnd now seem to be de
barred from landing from luck of certificates
required by the new. The recent purchase
by the United States of a large trading fleet
heretofore under the Chinese flag lias con
siderably enhanced our commercial im
portance in the Fast. In view of
the large number of vessels built
or purchased by American citizens in
other countries and exclusively employed in
legitimate traffic between foreign ports un
der the recosrnized protection of our flag, It
might be well to provide a uniform rate for
their registration and documentation, so that
the bona tide property rights of our citizens
therein shall be duly .evidenced and properly
guarded.
THE CONGO COUNTRY.
Pursuant to the advice of the Senate at the
last session. I recoimizcd the flag of the In
ternational Association of the Congo as that
of a friendly Government, avoiding in so do
Ing any prejudgment of conflict. In the ter
ritorial claims in that region subsequently
in execution of the expressed wish of Con
gress. I appointed a commercial agent for
the Congo basin. The importance or the rich
prospective trade of the Congo Valley has led
to a general conviction that it should be
open to ull nations upon equal terms. An
International conference tor tne eousiaera
tion of this subject was called by the Emper
or of Germany, and is now in session at Ber
lin. Delegates are in attendance on behalf
of the United States. Of the results of tbo
conference, you will be duly advised.
LEGATION PREMISES IN THE EAST.
The Government of Corea nas generously
aided the efforts of the United sitates Minis
ter to secure suitable premises for the use of
the legation. As;the conditions of the diplo
matic intercourse with the East
ern nations demand (that the legation
premises be owned by the repre
sented power, I advise that an appropriation
bo made for the acquisition of this property
by the Government. Tho United States af
ready possesses valuable premises ut Tan
giers ns a irift from the Sultan of Morocco. As
is stated hereafter, they have lately received
a similar gift from the Siamese Government.
The Government of Japan stands ready to
sell to us extensive grounds at Tokio where
in to erect a suitable building for the lega
tion, Court-house and Jail ; and similar priv
ileges can probably be secured in Chifia and
Persia. The owning of such premises would
not only affect a large saving of present
rentals, nut would permit of the due asser
tion of extraterritorial rights in these coun
tries, and M ould the better serve to maintain
the dignity of tne United States.
KOYPT.
The failure of Congress to make an appro
priation for our representative at the Auton
omous Court of the Khedive has proved a
serious embarrassment in our intercourse
with Egypt; and in view of the necessary in
timacy of the diplomat ic relationship due to
tne pamcipai ion oi tins uuvciiiuiuui no one
of the treaty powers in all matters of admin
istration there affecting the rights of for
eigners, I advise the restoration of the agency
and Consul-General at Cairo on Its former
basts. I do not conceive it to be the wish of
Congress that the I'nited States should with
draw altogether from the honorable position
they have hitherto held with respect to the
Khedive, or that citizens of this Republic re
siding or sojourning in Egypt should hereaf
ter be without the aid and protection of a
competent representative.
THE BARTHOLIU STATUE.
With France the traditional cordial rela
tionship continues. The Bartholin Statue of
Liberty enlightening the world, the generous
gift of the people of France, is expected to
reach New York in May next. 1 suggest that
Congressional action be taken in relation to
the spirit which has prompted this gift, and
In aid of the timely completion of the pedes
tal upon which it is to be placed.
GERMANY.
Our relations with Germany, a country
which contributes to our own some of the
best elements ot citizenship, continues to
be cordial. The United States have ex
tradition treaties with several of the Ger
man States, but by reason o. the con
federation of these States under the Im
perial rule, the application of such trea
ties is not as uniform and comprehen
sive as the interests of the two countries
require. I propose, therefore, to open ne
gotiations for a single convention of ex
tradition to embrace all the territory of the
Empire.
ENGLAND.
It affords me pleasure to say that our in
tercourse with Great liritaln continues to
be of a most friendly character.
HAWAII.
The Government of Hawaii has indicated
Its willingness to continue for seven years
tho provisions of the existing reciprocity
treaty. Such continuance, in view of the
relations of that country to the American
system of States, should, in my judgment, be
favored.
HAYTI.
The revolution in Hayti against the estab
lished Government has terminated. While
It was in progress it became necessary to
enforce our neutrality laws by instituting
proceedings against individuals and vcm
scls charged with their Infringement. These
prosecutions wt re in all case; successful.
IU TIES ON WORKS OK ART.
Much ar.xletv has lately been displayed by
various European Governments, and espec
ially by i the Government of Italy, for the
abolition of our import duties upon works of
art It is well to consider whether the pre
sent diacrimination in favor of the produc
tions of American artists abroad Is not likely
to result, as they themselves seem very gen
erally to believe it may. In the practical ex
clusion of our painters and sculptors from
the rich fields for observation, study and la
bor which they have hitherto enjoyed.
J a PAH.
There is a prospect that the long-pending
revision of the for. Ian treaties of Japan may
be concluded at a new conference to be.held
a Tokio. While this Government fully rec
ognizes the equal and independent station of
Japan in the community of nations, It would
not oppose the general adoption of such
terms of compromise as Japan maj be dis
posed to offer in 'urtherance of a naiform
nolicv of tntercoume with Western Nations.

eluded January 20, 188S, has been ratified and

gress to become effective. This legislation
Will, I doubt not, be among- the first meas
ures to claim your attention. A full treaty
of commerce, navigation and consular rights
is much to be desired, and such a treaty, I
have reason to bellevCj the Mexican Govern
ment stand- ready to conclude. Some em
barrassment has been occasioned by the fail
ure Of Congress at its last session to provide
means for the due execution of the treaty of
July 29, 1S2, for the resurvey of the Mexican
boundary and the relocation of the boun
dary monuments.
irtussiAi
The death of our representative' ai Russia,
while at his post at St. Petersburg, afforded
to the Imperial Government a renewed! op
portunity to testify its sympathy in a man
ner befitting the intimate friendliness which
has ever marked the intercourse of the two
countries.
SI AM.
Thn course of this Government In raising
Its representation at llatigkok to the diplo
matic rank has evoked from Siam evidences
of worm friendship and augnrs well for our
enlarged intercourse. The Siamese Govern
ment has presented to the United States a
commodious mansion and grounds for the
occupancy of the legation, duel I suggest that
by joint resolution Congress attest Us appre
ciation of this generous gift.
SPAIN.
This Government has more than once been
called upon of late to take actlofl Ml fulllll
ments of its International obligation towai'd
Spain, agitation iu the island of Cuba hostile
to the Spanish Crown havlngbeen fermented
by persons abusing the sacred rights of hos
pitality which our territory affords. The of
ficers of the Govennent have been Instructed
to exercise vigilance to prevent infractions
of our neutrality laws tit Key West and at
other points near the Cuban coast; I am
happy to say that in the only instance When
these precautionary measures were success-
fully eluded, the offenders when found in
our territory were subsequently tried and
convicted. 'The growing need of close rela
tionship of intercourse and traffic between
the Spanish Antilles and their natural mar
ket in the I'nited States, led to the adoption.
in January last, of a commercial agreement
looking to that end. This agreement has
since been superceded by a mOre carefully
framed and comprehensive convention
which 1 shall submit to the Senate for ap
proval. It has been the aim of this negotia
tion to open such a faTorod reciprocal
exchange of productions carried un
der the flag of either country its
to make the Intercourse between Cuba and
Porto Kico and ourselves scarcely less inti
mate than the commercial movement be
tween our domestic ports, and to insure a re
moval of the burdens on shipping in the
Spanish lndjes, of Which in the past ottr ship
Owners and ship masters have so often had
cause to complain, me iicguniiuun oi hud
couvention 1ms for a time postponed the
prosecution of certain claims of our citizens
which were declared to be without the juris
diction of the late Spanish -American Claims
Commission, and which we therefore remit
teii lo iHminmatta channels for adjustment.
The speedy settlement of these claims will
now be urged oy tne uovernmeui.

TURKEY.
Certain questions between the United
States and the Ottoman Empire still remain
unsolved. Comnlaints in behalf ' of our citl

which we re entitled bv the existing con
ventional stipulations ftndthe revision of the
taritts is unaccoinpnsneu.
VENEZUELA.
The final disposition of the pending ques
tions with Venezuela lias not as yet been
reached, but 1 have good reason to expect an
early settlement, which will provide the
means of re-examininir the Caracas awards
in conformitv with the expressed desire of
Congress, and which will recognize the jus
tice of certain claims preferred against Vene
zuela.
THE CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICAN COMMIS
BIOS
annotated bv authority of the act of July "
lssi. will soon proceed to Mexico. It lias
been furnished with instructions Which will
lie laid before you. They contain ft statemei
of the general nolicv of the Government for
enlaririnir commercial intercourse witl
American States. The Commissioners have
been actively prei.aring for their responsible
tank by holding conferences in the principal
cities witli merchants and others interested
in Central and South American trade.
FOREIGN EXHIBITIONS.
This Government is iu frequent receipt of
Invitations from foreign States to participate
in international exhibitions, often of great
interest and importance. Occupying as wc
do an advanced position on the world's pro
duction and aiming to secure a profitable
share for our industries In the general com
netitlvo markets, it is a matter of serious
concern that the want of means for partici
pation in these exhibits should so often ex
elude our producers from advantages en
loved bv those of other countries during the
past year. The nttention of Congress wiu
drawn to the for.Taal uivitt ouilu tins regard
tendered by the Governments of England,
Holland, Belgium, Germany and Austria.
The Executive has in some instances ap
pointed honorary commissioners. This is,
however, a most unsatisfactory expedient,
for without some provision to meet the nec
essary working expenses of a commission It
can effect little or nothing in behalf of ex
hibitors. INTERNATIONAL COPTRIGHT.
The question of securing to authors, com
posers and artists copyright privileges in this
country in return for reciprocal rights
abroad Justly challenges your uttontion. It
Is true that a convention will be necessary
for fully accomplishing this result. But un
til Congress shall by statute lix tho extent to
which foreign holders of copyright shall be
here privileged, it has been deemed Inadvisa
ble to negotiate such conventions. For
this reason the United States was not repre
sented at the recent conference at ISerne.
NEUTRALITY LAWS.
I recommend that the scope of the neutral
ity laws of the United States be so enlarged
as to cover all patent acts of hostility, com
muted In onr territory and aimed against the
peace of a friendly nation. Existing statutesJ
prohibit the fitting out of armed expeditions,
and restrict the shipment of explosives,
though the enactments In tho latter respect
were not framed with regard to interna
tional obligations, bat simply for the protec
tion of passenger travel. All these statutes
were Intended to meet special emer
gencies that had atfeady arisen. Other
emergencies have arisen since, and modern
ingenuity supplies means for the organiza
tion of hostilities without open resort to
armed vessels or filibusterine parties. 1 see
no reason why overt preparations In this
country for the commission of criminal
acts, such as are here under consideration,
should not be alike punlshablewhether such
acts are Intended to be committed in our
own country, or in a foreign country with
which we are at peace, i ne prompt anu
thorough treatment of this question Is one
which intimately concerns tho National
honor.
NATURALIZATION LAWS.
Our existing naturalization laws also need
revision. Those sections relating to persons
residing within the limits of the United
States Ih 1795 and 1798 havo now only an his
torical Interest. Section 2712, recognizing
the citizenship of the children of naturalized
parents Is ambiguous in its terms and part
ly obsolete. There arc special provisions of
law favoring the naturalization of those who
serve in the army or in merchant vessels, while
no similar privileges are granted those who
serve in the navy or marine corps. "An
uniform rule of naturalization, such
as the Constitution contemplates,
should, among other things, clearly
define the status of persons born within the
United States, subject to a foreign power."
section "And of minor children of
fathers who have declared their intention of
becoming citizens, but failed to perfect their
naturalizalion." It might bo wise to provide
for a central bureau of registry, wherein
should be filed authenticated transcripts of
every record of naturalization in the several
Federal and State Courts and to make pro
vision also for the vacation or cancellation
of such record In cases where fraud had been
practiced upon the court by tho applicant
himself, or where he had removed or forfeit
ed his acquired citizenship. A just and uni
form law in this respect would strengthen
thehandsof the Government In protecting
its citizens abroad, and would pave the way
for the conclusions of treaties of naturaliza
tion with foreign countries.
DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR SKRVIca.
The legislation of the last session effected
in the diplomatic and consular service cer
tain changes and reductions which have been
productive of embarrassment. The popula
tion and Intermediate activity of our coun
try are steadily on the Increase and are giv
ing rise to ever varying and often delicate
relationships with other countries. Our
foreign establishment now embraces
nearly double the area of operations
that It did twenty years ago. The
confinement of such a service within the lim
its of expenditure then established Is not. It
seems to me. In accordance with true econ
omy. A community of fiO. 001,000 of people
should be adequately represented In Its In
tercourse with foreign nations. A projset for

SILVER DOLLARS AND CERTIFICATES.
I concur with the Secretary of the Trens
ury in recommending the Immediate suspen
sion of the coinage of silver dollars and ol
the Issuance of silver certificates. This is a
matter to which in former communications I
have more than once invoked the attention of
the National Legislature. It appears that
annually for the past six years there have
been coined in compliance with the require
ments of the act of February 2sth, is7s, more
than twenty-seven million silver dollars. The
number now outstanding is reported by the
Secretary to be nearly 185,000,000, whereof
but little, more than 40,000,000, or less than
twenty-two per cent., are In actual circula
tion. The mere existence of this fact seems
to me to furnish of Itself a cogent argu
ment for the repeal of the statute which
has made such fact possible, but thero
are other and graver considerations that
tend in the same direction. The Secretary
avows his conviction that, unless this coin
age and Issuance of silver certificates be
suspended, silver Is likely at no dis
tant day to become our sole metallic
standard. The commercial disturbance
and the impairment of National credit that
would be thus occasioned can scarcely be
overestimated. 1 hope that the Secretary's
suggestions respecting the withdrawal from
circulation of the $1 and $2 notes will receive
youf approval. It Is likely that a considera
ble portion of the silver now in the vaults ol
the Treasury might find Its way into cur
rency. TRADE DOLLARS.
While trade dollars have ceased, for the
present at least, to be an element of active
disturbance in our currency system, some
provision should be made for their surrender
to the Government. In view of the circum
stances under which they were coined and
ji tt- fact that they have never had a legal
tender quality, there should tie, offered for
them only a slight advance over their bullion
value. The Secretary'. In the course of his
report, considers the propriety of beautify
ing the designs of our subsidiary silver coins,
and of so increasing their weight that they
may bear their due ratio of value to tho
standard dollar, Ilis conclusions in tills re
gard are cordially approved.
EXCISE TAXES.
In my annual message of 1882 I recom
mended the abolition of all excise taxes ex
cept those relating to distilled spirits. This
recommendation Is now renewed. In case
these taxes shall bo abolished the revenues
that will still remain to the Government
will, In my opinion, not only sufllce to meet
its reasonable expenditures, but will afford a
surplus largo enough to permit such tariff
reduction as may seem to lie advisable when
the results of the recent revenue laws and
commercial treaties shall have shown In
what quarters thoso reductions can be most
Judiciously effected.
FOREION TRADX.
One of the gravest of the problem which
appeal to tho wisdom of Congress for solu
tion is the ascertainment of the most effec
tive means of Increasing our foreign trade,
and thus relieving the depression under
which our industries are now languishing.
Tho Secretary of tho Treasury advises that
the duty of Investigating this subject be In
trusted In tho first Instance to a competent
commission. While fully recognizing the
considerations that may be urged against
this course, I am nevertheless of thn opinion
that upon tho whole no other would bo likely
to effect speedier or better resuftt.
811 ir PINO INTERESTS.
That portion of the Secretary's report
which concerns the condition of our ship
plug interests can not fall to command your
attention. Ho emphatically recommends
that as an Incentive to the. Investment of
American caiiitul In American steamships,
the Government shall, by liberal payments
for mall transportation or otherwise, lend its
active assistance to individual enterprise,
and declares his belief that unless that course
be pursued our foreign carrying trade mnt
remain ns it is to-day, almost exclusively in
the hands of foreigners. One phase of this
subject is now especially prominent, In view
of tho repeal, by the act of Juno 20. 1884, of
all the salutory provisions arbitrarily com
pelling American v essels to carry tho malls
to anillrom tho United States. As It Is nec
essary to make provision to compensate the
owners of such vessels for performing that
service after April, isss, It is hoped that the
whole subject will receive early considera
tion that will lead to the enactment of such
measures for tiie revival of our merchant
marine as the wisdom of Congress may de
vise. CIRCULATION r NATIONAL BANKS.
The three per cent, bonds of the (Intern
ment to the amount of more than $loo,ooo,ooo
have, since my last annual message, been re
deemed by the. Treasury. The bonds of that
Issue still outstanding amount to little over
$200,000,000, about one-fourth of which will ba
retired through the operations of tho sinking
fund durlrur the coming year. As these
bonds still continue tho chief basis for the
circulation of the National Hanks, the ques
tion how to avert the contraction of the cur
rency caused by their retirement Is one of
constantly Increasing importance.
TIIK WAR DEPARTMENT.
In the expense of the War Department the
Secretary reports a decrease of more than
$11,000,000, of which reduction $5,000,000 was ef
fected In the expenditures for rivers and har
bors and $2,7o,Ouo in expenditure for the
Huartcnnaster's lM-partment. Outside of
tat department the annual expenses of all
the army bureaus proper (except possibly
the ordnace bureau), are substantially
charges which can not be materially dimin
ished without change In the numerical
strength of the army. The expenditures In
the Quartermaster's Department can readily
be subjected to administrative discretion,
and It is reported by tho Secretray of War
