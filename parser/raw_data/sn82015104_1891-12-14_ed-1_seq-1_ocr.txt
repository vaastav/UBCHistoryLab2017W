Special to the Record-Unioic.
San Francisco, Dec. 13.—The Supreme
Court yesterday afternoon rendered a de
cision regarding the legality of the Grand
Jury selected by Judge Wallace. It de
clares the body to be illegal.
The opinion is written by Justice Mc-
Farland and is concurred in by Justices
Garoutte, Harrison and Paterson.
Chief Justice Boatty also declares the
Grand Jury an illegal body, but he does
not think that a writ of prohibition is the
proper process.
Justices Dellaven and Sharpstein dis
sent from the prevailing opinion.
IN lIANKi
Klwood Bruner, Petitioner and Plaintiff, vs.
the Superior Court ot the City an J County
of Wan Francisco and H. n. William T.
Wallace, Jndge thereof, Respondents and
Defendant*. No. 14,814.
Oil* is an application for a writ of prohibi
tion to prohibit the Superior Court oi" Han
Francisco, Department Number Six, and the
Judge thereof from proceeding further against
petitioner upon two certain paper-writings
.purporting to be indictments. Tlie main
ground of the petition is that the body of njvn
who presented said writings had no legal ex
istence as a Grand Jury, and that, therefore,
1 tie respondents have no jurisdiction or au
thority to arraijjn or try petitioner upon the
name. Upon the record presented two princi
pal questions arise. First, was 6:tid body a le
gal Grand Jury? and, second, if it was not.
then is prohibition a proper remedy?
The material facts in the case are undis
puted and are as follows: The respondent, the
presiding Judge, made an order that twenty
rive names be drawn in the usual way from
the "Grand Jury box" (which contained the
names of 144 persons selected by the twelve
Judges of the Superior Court) for the purpose
of procuring a Grand Jury. Alter service by
the Sheriff on all of said persons who could
be found, eighteen ot them appeared. Eight
of them were excused by the court for good
cause and the others were accepted. No fur
ther drawing from the Grand Jury box <in
TTnich there remained more than one hundred
names) was made; but thereupon the court
made the following order: "And it now ap
pearing to the court that of the entire number
of persons drawn to serve as Grand Jurors
there are only (he number often propel and
competent to so serve and not excused, it is
now nere ordered that a sufficient number, to
\.v it: the number of nine good and lawful men.
be forthwith summoned by an elisorappointed
by the court here for that purpose, to be and
appear before the court here on Thursday, Au
gust 20, lhtu, at 12 o'clock meridian, to
complete the s lid Grand Jury, and that Henry
>i. Scott be and is hereby appointed such
elisor; and all further proceedings in impanel
ing a Grand Jury are continued until the
2 nh day of August, 1891, at 12 o'clock me
ridian."
Another order was also made formally ap
pointing said Scott elisor, who, after being
■worn as such, returned nine other persons as
Grand Jurors. The whole of said nine per
sons were accepted; and thus the requisite
number of nineteen Grand Jurors were pro
cured and sworn. No reason was given why
the jury was not completed by an additional
drawing from the Grand Jury box; nor was
here any cause why. when the other method
of getting Jurors was adopted, the-Sheriff was
not ordered to summon them instead of an
elisor. No charge of partiality, interest or
disqualification of any kind was made against
the Shertfl by aflldavit or in any other man
ner, and the record shows that the Sheriff
was discarded and the elisor appointed
simply because the court chose to do S'j. And
the contention of respondent's counsel is that
the power of a Judge to appoint a private
i>erson to select a jury is unlimited and un
qualified by any provisions of law or any con-
Hiderations' whatever, his will being supreme
in the premises. No question, therefore, arises
here as to the jurisdiction of a court to pass
upon the issue of disqualification of a Sheriff
in such a case, because there is no such issue.
The provisions of statutory law upon the
questions here involved may be somewhat j
briefly stated. The formation of grand and
t rial juries is provided for in the Code of Civil
Procedure, commencing with Stcrion 204,
and the general provisions on the subject are
these: In January of each year the Superior
«'ourt of the county must make an order des
ignating the estimated number of grand
iurors that will be required lor the business of
the ensuing year, and thereupon the Board of
Supervisors must select from the qualified
citizens of the county—taking them as nearly
as may be from the different wards and town
ships in proportion to population—the num
ber designated by the court. A certified list
of these names is given to the County Clerk.
who must write the names of the grand
urors on separate pieces of paper of uniform
appearance, and having folded them so as to
conceal the names, must deposit them in a
box called the "Grand Jury box." And
whenever, during the year, a court orders a
Grand Jury it is provided that the jurors
': hall be drawn by the clerk in the presence of
the court. He must shake the box so as to
mix the slips containing the names before
drawing, and inusi observe other statutory
directions providing against the unfair draw
ing of particular names for particular pur
•x)ses. (Sees. 241, 219.) In c.ties and counties
of more than 100.000 Inhabitants, which in
eiudes San Francisco, the jurors i.re selected
In January, by the Judges of the Superior
Court, instead* of by the Supervisors. (Sec.
204.) I>'- all other respects the law is the
same. Such is the general method provided
by statute for the formation of juries, and it
is"as wise n method as eiuld well be devbed
to procure fair and Impartial jurors, and to
prevent public officers from bringing together
certain persons on a jury lnoruer to secure a
certain result, to annoy the innocent or pro
iec; the guilty.
There is. however, another provision of the
code, intended evidently for cases of neglect
of duty or Inadvertence aud to prevent m
some instances great delay or expanse, on
which the right of ttie court to procure a
itii y as it was procured in the case at t>ar is
ba-ed. The thought of the Legislature in en
acting tho provision would seem to have been
directed more particularly to trial than to
grand jurors; but if its language be wide
enough to grant the power here contended
;or, then the power exists. But if the language
«loes not grant such power, then it does not
exist, for it is granted nowhere else. Tin said
provision is coniaiuod in Section 22ti, and is
its follows: -Whenever jurors are not drawn
or summoned to attend any court of record or
session thereof, or a sufficient number of
Jurors fall to appear, such court may order a
sufficient number to be forthwith drawn and
summoned to attend the court, or It may, by
;m order entered on itg minutes, direct the
Hheriff, or an elisor chosen by the court, 'orth-
M-ith to summon so may good and lawful men
of the county, or city and county, to serve as
jurors, as may be required, and in either case
KUch Jurors must be summoned in the manner
provided in the preceding section."
It is apparent ihat the claim of power under
ihesuid Section 226 to do the thing com
plained of in the case at bar should be closely
scrutinized, and denied unless the power be
found to be clearly given; for, if it exist, it is a
most arbitrary and dangerous power—one
that can easily be used to unjustly destroy
character, liberty or life. And in determining !
•whether or not there be such legal power we
jnust discard all consideration of the worthi
ness or unworthiaess oi the purpose sought to
bo attained in any particular case. There
must be attributed to the learned Judge of the
<oitrt below good motives and purposes; but
if he have the power claimed then such power
must be conceded to every other person who
may at any time ocaupy a similar judicial
]>osltion. Under such power a court could
«nsily procure the indictment and, perhaps,
the conviction of any person whom it deemed
to bean offender, by simply appointing a per
son favorable to its designs to select jurors
■with a similar bias. In times of great public
excitement— political or otherwi.-e-a citizen |
who had incurred censure in certain quarters
■would have scarcely a remnant left of that
jirotection which is afforded by a fair trial be
jore an impartial jury: and to cay that such
unlimited power can be safely lodged with a'l
the men who may happen to be Judges would
be to ignore human history and the principles
cf human nature. It must be remembered
that unauthorized power may be used

for bad as well as for good purposes. A
spectator might, for the moment, look in
safety and witn complaisance upon the
barbaric tumult of a mob if he happen to be
in sympathy with its present design; but let
the fury of another mob be directed against
him, or those he knows or believes to be
innocent, and he will appreciate at once the
value ot legal protection. So, also, he may
lo°k "gntly ujo.t the spectacle of a Jury
packed Tor the purpose of prosecuting one
whom he believes to be guilty; but if such a
course were pursued toward him, or his
friend, he would have clear views of personal
security and the sacredness of a jury trial.
Under the best system that human wisdom
can devise an innocent man will, at long in
tervals, be punished, and a guilty one go free;
but that a government Of law is better than a
government of unlimited personal power Is a
principle that has been fought out in English
and American history, and established as a
monument of liberty.
The asserted power of the court In the case
at bar comes. If it comes at all, from those
words in the section last quoted, "or an eli
sor.' It has no other source. The whole
force and stress of the question involved rest
on the word "elisor." The languige is not
that the .court shall direct the sheriff "or
some other person," or *-any qualified citi
zen," or "any other person "over the age of
eighteen" (as in case of service of summons in
civil casts 10 summon the jury. There is no
ordinary, general language used which would
have denoted a legislative intent to give the
court unlimited discretion under any and all
circumstances, without any showing, to
choose whomsoever it pi ases to pick out a jury.
Common language is discarded, and theix
clusively legal word "elisor"—a word used no
where else than in law language—is employed.
| What is the meaning ol that word? And
what was the legislative intent in using it?
A iule of construction that has always ob
tained is aptly expressed in Section 10 of the
Code of Civil Procedure, as follows: "Words
and phrases are construed according to. the
c jntext and the approved use ot language,
bit technical words and phrases, and such
others as have acquired a peculiar ana appro
priate meaning in law, or are defined in the
suceieding section, arc to be construed accord
ing to such peculiar nnd appropriate mean
ing or definition." Now the word "elisor"
has a "peculiar and appropriate meaning m
law," as much as i.My word that can be sug
gested. It is not used at all in common lan
guage. No one in private or business circles
would think of culling an agent or trustee an
"elisor." It can be found rarely, if ever, n
general literature. It is doubtful if the major
ity of men of good intelligence have any no
tion M to its meaning. Practically it is
known and used alone in law literature. And
in the law its meaning is clear and unques
tioned. It has always rmaut, and means
now, a person appointed to perform certain
duties pertaining to certain officers when the
latter are disqualifiel. He was originally con
fined to the duty of returning a jury "in the
event of such disqualification, but in some
States his duties are extended to the service of
other process, but always only in the event of
the disqualification of some other officer. The
provision for such appointment as stated In
Klackstonc is as follows: "If the SheritTbe not
an indifferent person, as if he be a party to tiie
suit, or be related either by blood or aflinitv to
either of the parties, he is not then trusted
to return the jury, but the venire shall be
directed to the Coroners, who in this, as
in many other instance*, are the substi
tutes of the Sheriff to execute process, when he
is deemed an improper person. If any excep
tion lies to the Coroners, the venire shall be
directed to two clerks of the court.or two ] ar
sons of the county named by the court and
sworn. And these two, who are called elisors,
or electors, shall indifferently name the jury,'1
etc. (3 Bla. Comm. 355.1 In Bouvier's Law
Directory elisors are defined as '"persons ap
pointed by the court to return a jury when
• the Sheriff and Coroner have been challenged
I as incompetent." Such is the definition given
in all the dictionaries, and such the sense In
i which the word i« used in all the law books to
I which our attcnt'on has been culled; and we
do not understand that counsel for respondent
claims differently.
Therefore, considering the universal moan
ing given in the lawgeneraUv to the word
"elisor," and without considering any other
legislative provision upon the subjectin this
State, it would seem clear that when Section
I 226 gives power to direct the Sheriff, or
I elisor. to summon a jury, it uses the word as
I designating a person to be appointed in the
I event that the Sheriff" has been "challenged as
incompetent." Sucli construction is not only
compelled by the only known meaning of the
word, but brings the section into harmony
with all the other sections relating to the
selection of juries, the object of which is
clearly to have jurors, as far as possible, fair
and impartial. The Sheriff is an officer elected
by the pe< pie, and usually long before he is
called upon to select a jury, li he should be
secretly partial in any future ease it would bo
an accidental evil; he could not.atksast.be
appointed for such express pur^o^e. And ihe
tact that 'Coroner" was omitted (Inadvert
ently or otherwise) from Section 226 does nt
change the meaning of elisor—who is essen
tially one who is a substitute for some dis
qualified officer.
But our statutory law gives the same mean
ing t i •'elisor" that is given to it in the general
authorities. It is provided that, "with rela
tion to each other, the provisions of the four
codes must be construed (except as in the next
two sections provided), as though all such
codes had been passed at the same moment of
lime, and were parts of the same statute."
(P. C, Sec. 4,480.) (The next two sections
refer to cases of conflict and have no applica
tion here.) When, therefore, "elisor" is sut d
in one code it must be deemed to have been
sued with reference to its definition given in
another code. The Political Code, from Sec
tion 1,17r> to 4.193, deals with the duties of
Sheriff and with process and notices and their
service. It refers to both civil nnd criminal
procedure. Section 4.17G provides generally
that the Sheriff must "serve all process anil
not'c?s in the manner prescribed by law.'
Section 4,17 5 provides that, "Process as used
in this article includes all writs, warrant >,
and orders of Courts of Justice or judicial offi
cers. Notice includes all papers and orders
(except process) required to be ser\ed in any
proceeding before any court, board or officer
or when required by law to be served inde
pendently of such proceeding." It is impossi
ble to imagine any sort of ii thing ordered by
a court, or Judge thereof, which has to be ex
ecuted by an officer that is not embraced in
the above definition*; and the general statu
tory provision is that it must be executed by
the Sheriff. Section 4,191 provides, however,
that if the Sheriff be a "party to an action or
proceeding," the process and orders then-in
must be exscuted by the Coroner. And then
in Section 1,192, the office and functions of an
elisor are provided for and describe.1 as i<»i
--lows: "Process and orders in an a«;lon or pro
ceeding may be executed by a person resid
ing in the county, designated by the court, the
Judge thereof, or a County Judge, and de
nominau-d an elisor, in the following cases
1. When the Sheriff and Coroner are both par
tifs. 2. When either of these officr< is a parfv
and the process is against the other; and, 3.
Whea either of these officers is a party and
there is a vacancy in the office of the other, or
when it appears by affidavit to the satisfaction
of the court in which the proceeding is pend
ing, or to the Judge thereof, that both of these
officers are disqualified, <>r by reason of any
bias, prejudice, or other cause, would not act
promptly or impartially.' 1 The only attempt
to break the force of this provision is by way
of suggesting tiiat the word "proceeding," as
used tnerein, must be limited to thHt peculiar
kind of civil n>m: dy which is called in Sec
ti< li 2-> imrt in OoeUon 1.0»>3 ct seq. iC. C. P.)
a "special proceeding." But there is no room
for such construction. The provision In ques
tion does not ««ay special proceeding, and the
preceding sections and the whole article ,n
which it occurs refer to both civii and criminal
matters, and use the word "proci c ling" in its
general and well-known sense, which includes
Jill st*ps taken and all things (tonewherein
judicial procedure ia instituted or judicial ac
tion invoiced. Even in a strictly civil action
when leetttng what hud occurred in the case*
we say, "such proceedings were had," etc'
This is the common meaning of the word
••proceeding" when applied to things done in
court or before Judicial officers. Indeed, coun
sel f<>r respondents, in his brief, refers very
naturally to the formation of a Grand Jury as
a -proceeding." And so we have a statutory
definition and description of "elisor" in full
accord with the meaning that hr.s always bten
given it in the general law.
It is contended that no matter how a body
of men may have been gathered together it's
acts cannot be attacked if it be recognized by
the court as a "Grand Jury"—upon ihe prin
ciple sometimes applied to the acts of de Lcto
public officers. One of the respondents' coun
sel goes so far as to assert that the legal exist
ence of a jury can bs inquired into oniv by the
proceeding of quo warrants; and while other
counsel do not assume that very no>el posi
tion, yet their views logically drift them there
But quo warranto does not lie against a mere
temporary employment like that of a jury it
lies only against the holder of a public oince
having a "n.\ed and permanent tenure." (Law
son's Rights, Remedies and Practice, vol. 7
sec. 4,040, and notes.) It would, indeed, be
startling if a man cou.d be put to the partial
ignominy and hazard of a trial at the will of
any set of men whom a court might choose to
style a Grand Jury. But the correct doctrine
on that subject was clearly stated by this
court in Levy vs. Wilson (tfy Cal. 105),"where
the court, thiough McKee. J., says: "One of
the grounds stated in the petition" is that the
indictment was found by a body of men styled
a Grand Jury, that was not in law and fact 'a
valid and c institutional Grand Jury." It that
l>e so, the uc-usatory paper returned to the
court below a> an indictment is worthless and
void. (People vs. Thurston, 8 Cal. 89), and
the court has no jurisdiction to try the pe
titioner upon it. For no person can oV held to
answe;- for crime unless on information, after
examination and commitment by a magis
trate, or an indictment by a Grand Jury."

RECIPROCITY AGREEMENTS.
Satisfactory Negotiations With the

Special to the Kecord-Untox.
Washington, Dec. 13.—1t is under
stood that the reciprocity negotiations
with the sugar-producing colonies of
Great Britain in the West Indies, autho
rized by Section 3 of the McKinley bill,
have reached a satisfactory conclusion in
every case except that of Jamaica. The
conventions agree upon involved inter
ests in Trinidad and Barbadoes, together
with those of Demerara in British Gui
ana. In the case of Jamaica it is be
lieved that the only difficulty in the way
of reaching an agreement is prevented by
the amount of revenue which that colony
is asked to relinquish and which its rep
resentatives here are understood to de
j clare it is impossible to sacrifice without
j impairing the credit of the colony, which
it is pledged to secure railway bonds
guaranteed by the Government and held
to a large extent in this country. The
United States seven years ago made the
same offer as now in regard to the re
moval of sugar duties. England would
then have none of it on the ground that
such an arrangement would contravene
British free trade ideas. The colonists
cannot fail to be delighted, and their dis
satisfaction with the English rulers, in
creased by what occurred seven years
ago, will be replaced by a different senti
ment.
TIIE CONTEST A BEAUTT.
Fourteen-Kound Fight Between Tom
Ryan and -Frank Ilowson.
Chicago, Dec, 13.—Tommy Ryan is
still champion welter-weight of the
world. He retains the title after a four
teen-round fight with Frank Ilowson of
Sheffield, England, fought near here this
morning. From a professional and scien
tific standpoint, the contest was a beauty.
j The battle was remarkable for its fair
■ ness. Not a call of "foul" was made, not
an advantage" taken, and not an angry
word exchanged by the contestants.
Ryan emerged from the fight unscratched,
| while his opponent has one eye ne-irly
j knocked out and one cheek iaid opeu.
I Howson, while as quick as a cat, was
j handicapped by his inability to hit hard,
and too much training. Ryan displayed
generalship. The fight was for $I,<KX) a
side and the welter-weight champion
ship, and was witnessed by about .SOO
people. Ryan was favorite in betting.
George Siler was referee. Harry Gilmore
and Tommy White were Jhiowson's sec
onds, and Jim Manning of Buffalo and
Henry Baker of Michigan acted for
Ryan. Queensberry rules prevailed.
Time was called at 3:24 a. m.
After sparring for an opening, Howson
got in a right-hander on Ryan's neck that
jarred him for a moment, the round end- I
ing with a severe left upper-cut on the
Englishman.
In the second round Howson received
a blow on the cheek from Ryan's left, and
countered on the latter's ribs. Ryan gave
his opponent two rib blows, and as time
was called Howson seemed winded.
In the fifth Ryan sent the Englishman
to the ropes with a hard left-hander, the
round closing with three blows on How
son's ribs.
In the sixth the Englishman planted
right and left on Ryan's ribs, the latter
returning the compliment with a blow
that closed the Englishman's left eye.
In the seventh and eighth Ryan placed
severe short-arm lefts on Sowson'a game
eye, and sent him to his seat with several
hard body blows, receiviug one good rib
roaster himself.
In the tenth, evidently thinking his op
ponent was getting tir< d, the Englishman
started in with both hands, but received
a blow on the cheek that brought Ihs*
blood.
During the next three rounds Ryan
planted blow after blow on Howson's
damaged eye and lacerated cheek. When
the thirteenth round closed Howsou's
eye was entirely closed.
In the last round, after Ryan had re
ceived a couple of hard right-hand swings
on the ribs, he feinted wim his rjght. \s
llowson slowly turned his face to dodge,
Ryan gave him a left-hand swing on the
jaw. The Englishman rolled up, gasped,
and sank to the lloor coinpletsly knocked
out. While not rendered insensible, he
was so badly jarred that he could not get
up, and the tight was given to Ryan.
Ryan's next tight will be at San Eran
ciseo with Danny Needham lor the cham
pionship.

OAUFIIXD PARK RACE COURSE.
Chicago, Dec. 13.—The raid made on
the Oartield race track yesterday caused a
sensation in all circles. The press, the
clubs, and prominent citizens have re
cently taken a hand with the business men
for the permanent suppression of this
place, which is located within the city
limits about a stone's throw from one of
the finest parks in the city. The light
promises yet to be bitter.
At a meeting held at the Illinois Club
last night the Uarfield Park Club was de
clared a public nuisance and a menace to
the peace and good order of the citizens of
the West Side. President Chalmers, after
stating the object of the meeting—to dis
cuss ways and means for closiug up the
track—said: "No legitimate race-course
was ever conducted as this track has been
run during the past year. To-day they
stopped racing, but have already issued
circulars that they will resume in April.
I think if we take this matter in hand we
can close the track forever."
Ex-Mayor Carter H. Harrison, editor
and proprietor of the Times; Rev. Dr
AVithlow of the Third Presbyterian
Church, President Thompson of the West
Park Board, Rev. Dr. Lawrence of the
Second Baptist Church, and Rev. Mr.
Wallace of the Eighth Presbyterian
Church, were the principal speakers
against the track.
A committee was appointed to wait on
Mayor Washburne in regard to the nuis
ance.
FIFTY-SECOND CONGRESS.
Little Active Legislative Business
Probable the Present Week.
Washington, Dec. 13.—As far as actual
legislative business is concerned it is
probable the present week in Congress
will be devoid of feature or interest. It
has come to be generally understood that
while the time before the holiday recess
in the long session may be employed in
perfecting the organization of the two
branches of Congress, little may be at
tempted with profit in the line of legisla
tion. Many Senators and Representa
tives, assuming that the recess will begin
before the end of the week, have already
made arrangements to leave Washington
in a few days.
Unless unforseen difficulties are en
countered the organization of the com
mittees will be completed Monday or
Tuesday, but there is no expectation" that
they will undertake any important work
during the week. The introduction of
bills and resolutions were not presented
in a rush last week.
A speech by Senator Turpie on the
subject of the election of Senators by a
direct vote of the people, and one* by
Senator Stewart on free silver coinage,
together with such responses as they may
elicit, will probably compose the record
of the week in the Senate.
Tho Houso will not meet until Wednes
day, and after a brief session will prob
ably adjourn, with an understanding that
on the day of reassomblage it will adjourn
for the customary Christmas recess.
A proposition has been broached that
Congress adjourn Friday, the 18th, to
Monday, January 4th. It is believed that
in the absence of committee organi
zation nothing can be accomplished by
continuing nominal sessions of the House
into the following week before taking
the usual recess. The Speaker has beeu
industriously engaged in the work pre
liminary to the appointment of tho com
mittees, but the experience of the past
warrants the belief that it will be found
impracticable to complete them in timefor
announcement before the new year. The
Committee on Rules may be announced
during the coming week, in order that its
members may proceed to formulate rules
lor the Fifty-second House, and submit
it ior consideration immediately upon re
assembling after the holidays.
CRIMINAL RECORD.
John Miller, While Intoxicated, Shoots
Ills Wife and Suicides.
Mt. Olive (111.), Dec. 13.—Yesterday
John Miller, aged <iB, during tho absence
of his wife, became intoxicated. On her
return he threatened her life. She ran
out of the house. He followed and fired
a bullet clear through her body. He then
committed suicide. Mrs. Miller's wound
is thought to be fatal. The tragedy was
evidently premeditated, as a few days
ago Miller settled up all his business af
fairs.

RIOUSLY INJURED.
Ileavy Storms Reported Throughout
England and "Wales — Floods Re
ported in Many Places, and Streets
Under Water—Views Relating to
the Effect of the Copyright Law on
American and English Literature.
Special to the Record-Union;
Dublin, Dec. 13.—Michael Davitt, the
famous Irish leader, was seriously
wounded during a riot at "Waterford City
to-day. Davitt and William O'Brien had
gone to Waterford in support of the
candidature of Mr. Keane, nominee of
the McCarthyites for the seat in Parlia
ment made vacant by the death of
Richard Power. Keane's opponent is
Mr. Redmond, a member of the Parnell
wing of the Irish party. Davitt was
strongly urged by the MeCarthyites to
stand for Waterford, but declined to do
so, and. in consequence of his refusal
Keane wfes made the nominee. Xo par
ticulars of the affray in which Davitt
was wounded have as yet been received.
Later reports from Waterford show
that the riot this afternoon was one of the
most sanguinary and vicious of any of the
political rows that has recently attended
discussions in Irish towns of the rival
leaders. Ominous rumors of an impend
ing row had been exciting the populace
lor some time, and a force of (XKf police
had been drafted in town in hopes that
their presence would secure order. The
rarnellite leaders, Kedmond, Leamy and
Dalton, had been in Waterford some days.
This afternoon special trains brought
hundreds of supporters of the rival candi
dates, and their contingents, armed with
blackthorn shillalies, marched through
the streets to tho music of brass bands.
Davitt and others, also attended by a
band of music, proceeded to the quar
tan of the National Commercial Club.
En route a mob of Parnellite followers
began one of the fiercest contlicts that has
characterized the prevailing hostilities.
The opposing crowds fought at very
close quarters, and surged to and fro
through the streets, seeming utterly re
gardless of the presence of the police.
Volleys of stones were hurled through
the air, and blackthorns moved with a
vicious celerity that sent many howling
rioters to the hospitals, police station and
then for surgical attention.
In the midst of the affray Davitt re
ceived a nasty cut on the forehead, from
which the blood flowed freely. Tanner
and others were injured by stones.
At last the police formed a cordon and
divided the opposing mobs, and the
Davitt crowd reached the club rooms.
O'Brien made the speech of the day, bit
terly denouncing the assault upon his
friends, and saying the crowds who in
jured Davitt had struck a glorious blow
for the Irish cause. Davitt's answer to
that blow was that now he was a candi
date for Waterford. O'Brien, in conclu
sion, accused the police of using their
batons more in favor of the attacking
mob than otherwise. The police, he as
serted, protected the Parnellites, while
the force of their blows wss devoted to
the McCarthyites.
The police were entirely unable to quell
the contest. The respective bands of mu
sicians had their horns twisted and drums
torn into shreds. Constant skirmishes
continued until the Davitt crowds reached
their rendezvous.
After Davitt's wounds were dressed lie
appeared at a window of the clubhouse
and spoke briefly. Mr. Redmond, upon
hearing of the all'air, drove to Davitt's
hotel and left a note expressing regret for
what occurred.
STORMS IN ENGLAND.
Reports of Damage Done Continue to
He Received.
London, Dec. I.*.—Reports of the dam
age by storms continue to come in. News
was received to-day that 11. M. S. Bantry
hud been driven ashore by a gale iv Bid
deford Bay, and was in a perilous posi
tion, but a later dispatch says that she is
again afloat, and only slight damage
caused. The Bantry left Queeustown on
Wednesday for Plymouth. She made
slow progress, and was unable to make
St. ives, owing to the beavy seas which
nearly drove her up the British Channel.
She lost two boats, and the crew became
almost exhausted.
A hurricane swept over Camp Alder
shot to-day, doing considerable damage,
blowing off the glass roof of tne barracks
and damaging every buiidiug on the
ground more or less. Fortunately the
soldiers were at divine service when the
storm broke, and no one was injured, the
church in which the services were being
held having withstood the gale.
Vessels arriving at Queenstown report
terrific weather on the Atlantic. Build
ings have been unroofed at the Welsh sea
port of Llanily, and Dr. Kees was fatally
injured by a roof lulling on him. Along
the \orkshire coast there has been a
severe snowstorm. The suspension of
railway service is reported. Floods are
reported in many parts of Derbyshire
and many streets are under water in Mat
lock. In Todmorden Valley damage
amounting to £1,000 was done by high
water. Scores of houses were flooded and
bridges demolished. At Cambridge two
girls were crushed to death, fallino- walls
burying them.
THE COPYRIGHT LAW.
Interviews With Leading English
Publishers on the Effects.
LONDON, Dec. 13.—A series of inter
views with publishing firms here by the
Associated Press, with a view to ascer
taining the effect the Airierican copyright
law was producing, have been made re
cently. Several important firms hesi
tated in expressing an opinion, on the
ground that their business arrangements
hardiy permitted their views to be made
public. Others said the Act had been in
operation too brief a time to enable them
to form definite judgment of the results.
The summing up of the other interviews
shows the concensus of opinion to be that
the effects of the law will not be detri
mental to either European or American
trade. It is thought, however, that the
law will result in a gradual cheapening
of good literature in both countries.
CHILEAN AFFAIRS.
The President's Message Has the Effect
of a Bombshell at Santiago.
London, Dec. 13.—A Santiago dispatch
to the Times says: President Harrison's
message has had the effect of a bombshell.
It is regarded in official circles as a
breach of diplomatic usage. The Foreign
Office has sent to all Chilean legations
for publication a circular reflecting offi
cial and public opinion on the subject.
The Gazette (official organ) publishes
notes exchanged between the Chilean
Government and Egan. These corrobor
ate the declarations contained in the cir
cular sent by the Chilean legations.
It appears that the Foreign Office asked
Mr. Kgan on November 9th to supply
preferred testimony to substantiate the
grave charges against the Chilean offic
ials. A month's delay in complying with
the request prevented President Harri
son from a knowledge of the result of the
inquiry into the Baltimore affair, a
knowledge of which, it is believed, would
have altered the message entirely.
The Fi'rro Carrill publishes a telegram
saying that ninety sailors of the United
States ship Boston were allowed to go
ashore at Montevideo, recently, and they
immediately started on a drunken spree.
The men, the telegram alleges, were
guilty of riotous conduct, and got into
several scrimmages with the police, in all
of which the sailors were the aggressors.
