uapt. Simpson s men were in a nonse

was surrounded by lue Moccasins, wtio de

clined and a fight ensued. Some eight or
ten ot the Moccasins were killed, and they
were driven back- into the woods. Among
the. number killed of tho Moccasins is the
notorious Pat. Connoly, who has boasted.
of having- in his possession jhirty-one

Capt. John Brown's Company of Sharp-"
shooters has joined Col. Jennison's com

the famous Jayhawker whoso name is as
much of a terror to tho rebel residents and
marauders inwiiissouri as Jim Lane's, and
the accession of John Brown's men was the
occasion ofouitoa demonstration. Col.
Jenhison made them a chacteristic speech
declaring that "old John Browc was the
only man in whom he ever took stock;"
that,tbe slaves or rebels who iook reiuge
with-him should be protected to the last
man and tbe last bullet: that he meant
to make contrabands useful; adding the
significant bint. that be did notbnowof any
better way of employing captured rebel

Flogging Lapies in .Russia. One of
the most perplexing supjects before the ad
ministration at Washington bas been the
disposition of the secesh females who
swaim in the Capital, and have given aid
and.comXort to the rebels, by 'furnishing
information of military movements, fcc.
According to the following in the Opinion
Nationals, the Russian Government have
few scruples as to the course to be pursued
in such an emergency :
'Three, unmarried ladies attended the
course of lectures" al,tbe Uuiversity of St.
Petersburg. Two- of the young ladles,
Miss. Corsini inllhe fortress of St. Peters
burg; and the third, MissrBJogdarow, has
been flogged al the ofhee ot the secretrpo-
ice. , -
The'Opinion Natipnale adds:
"Miss -Bgo'darow may be consoled. She
is;not" the .first among Russian ladies, who
has been flogged in the courtyard of tbe
police hotel. May she be the-last! We
wish it, without daring to hope it. The
cfouM'iliberal opinions) are yoiihg in Rus
sia. The era of persecution has been on
ly begun, and, we cannot but congratulate
the ladies of "Russia on their ardor in seek
ing,the. crown of martyrdom."
