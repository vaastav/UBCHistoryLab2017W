DEATH OF JOSEPH BANCROFT, THE MAN
UFACTURER.
Joseph Bancroft, who died yesterday,
at his residence, at Rockford, near this
city, in the 72d year of his age, was born
in Manchester, England, April 7th, 1803.
He received his education in a Friends*
school, and at the ago of fourteen was
apprenticed to his uncle, Jacob Bright,
father of the John Bright now so cele
brated in English politics. In 1824 he
emigrated to thi9 city, where he engaged
with his brothers, who were manufactur
ing flannel in the old mill just north of
the Brandywine bridge. In a year or
two thereafter he took charge of Wm.
Young & Son's cotton mills, at Rockland.
In 1831 he bought the property
where the Rockford Mills and village
(frequently called Bancroft's Banks)
now stands. There were then only
two small houses, besides his own resi
dence, on the place, while now there
are from sixty to seventy there, besides
the extensive mill buildings, library,
etc.

His business career was marked with
signal success, which was, however,
achieved by repeated hard struggles
against adversity.
In 1829 the deceased married Sarah,
daughter of William and Sarah Poole,
of this city, by whom ho had two sons
who became bis partners in 1805, form
ing the present linn of Joseph Bancroft
& »Sons.
Deceased was a consistent Friend of
the "Hickaite" persuasion, though lie
was an earnest advocate of the union
of tho two divisions forming tho Socie
ty of Friends. He was a man of many
good qualities, business aud personal,
and his death will be widely regretted
as tho ending of a long, useful and
honorable career.

The Message—Opinions of the

From the Baltimore Gazette.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The Message of Fresidenb Grant, os
transmitted to Congress and published
elsewhere, is in many respects a more
forcible one than could have been antici
pated from those which have hitherto
emanated from our self-indulgent Presi
dent. In the very begining he touches
sharply upon the existing financial dis
tress of the country. Business and in
dustries are, as ho truly says, prostrated,
while labor and capital are plentiful.—
He therefore thinks that ''wise states
manship at this session of Congress
would dictate legislation ignoring the
past, directing in proper channels these
groat elements of prosperity." Most ex
cellent advice, if only carried out.

up
[From tin Baltimore Sun."]
It is gratifying to find that upon this
ail important subject, which is pre
eminently and above all other», "the
question of the hour," the President's
trumpet gives no uncertain sound. lie
declares in favor of resumption and of
a return to decent money, not merely
in the abstract or in vague and general
terms, but explicitly and specifically,
urgingupon Congress,"at thlssession,"
tho duly and necessity of placing the
currency of the country upon a basis
common to and recognized by the
civilized world. In tliisportion of his
message, in principle —we do not speak
of details—the President's views are
as sound as a dollar—and a gold dollar
at that.

A BATTLE in THE STREET.
Vicksburg, Dec. 7—There has been for
some time trouble brewing between the
Taxpayers' Association ana citizens and
eounty officials. The sheriff was acting ed
without legal bond, and tho board of bu
peiwiaors refused to order a new one, al
thougii time for paying taxes had arriv
ed.
Two or three other officials were under
indictments for forgery and embezzle
ment, and citizens, despairing of relief
from partisan agents, held a meeting last
Wednesday, and in a body proceeded|to
the Court House to demand the résigna
tion of tlio sheriff, tho chancery clerk,
treasurer and coroner.
All fled except Sheriff Crosby, a negro,
and he signed his resignation. On Satur
day a card appeared on tlio streets signed
"Crosby," calling on all citizens of War
ren county, Republicans,white and black,
to come to his aid and support him in his
position.
Crosby publicly, and through the pa
pers, denied tho authorship of the card,
yet this morning armed bodies of negroes
oppeured advancing on the city, from six
different roads. The alarm was sounded
about nine o'clock, and the citizens gath
ered cn masse, armed, and immediately
advanced to meet the negroes on the
Baldwin Ferry road.
The negroes were met just outside the
city, on Urovo street, about 200 strong.—
Tho commander of the citizens warnod
tho negroes to disperse, but they refused,
and immediately firing commenced on
both sides.
Tho negroes retreated abouta mile and
again made a stand in old breastworks
and a house, but were soon routed. The
loss in this engagement was one citizen,
Oliver Brown, killed, and about twelve
or fifteen negroes killed, several wounded
and about twenty prisoners, On tho Hills
Ferry road about two hundred and lifty
negroes were met and routed after a
short engagement, with several killed
and wounded. Andrew Owens, a negro,
who commanded tho negroes on Bald
win's Ferry road, was captured and com
mitted to jail.
A PRECONCERTED PLAN AN ATTACK.
In an interview with a reporter Owens
said he was ordered by Sheriff Crosby to
come to the city to-dav with all the arm
ed men he could get together. Alex.
Stockhouse, from Newton, one of the cap
tured negroes, says the order for all ne
groes to come to Vicksburg this morning
was read in church on Sunday.
Crosby who is under guard at the court
house, denies that he gave such orders.
It is reported this evening that negroes
are committing depredations in the coun
try. Tho intense excitement that pre
vailed this morning has subsided to a
great degree, yet many citizens are un
der arms, and all the roads are picketed.
THE LATEST
Evidence just received renders it abso
lutely certain that Governor A mes and
liis Attorney-General, George E. Harris,
incited and advised tho invasion of this
city by negroes to-day. This evidence
has been laid before the ablest lawyers of
tho city, with a .view to arresting and
bringing .these partios to this city for
trial.

Dover,JDkl., Dec. 7,1874.
Tho Tjey y Court of this County, in a
session last week, after transacting othei
business, resolved to place a clock and
bell in the cupalo of the Court House,
providing one-half of the amount bo raia
ed by tlio citizens of Dover, which wai
soon raised.
The fire at Lebanon, last Thursday
night, when J. S. Collins & Co's factory
was totally consumed, was ono of the
largest fires that has ever occurred in
this Bection of country. The loss is up
ward of $50,000 nearly covered by insur
once.
Tlio Wilmington Conference Academy
has now about seventy-five students.—
Tho building has recently been lighted
with gas.
James L. Walcott, Esq., Attorney-at
Law, has been authorized by the Levy
Court to rent tho new offices in the Court
House.
The Legislature of this State will con
vene on 'luosday, January 5th, and John
P. Cochran will be inaugurated as Gorer
nor on Tuesday tho 19th of January. The
coming session of the Legislature will, no
doubt, be a very interesting ono. The
people at the late election, from one end
of the State to the other, decided by
their ballots to continue in power, tho
Democratic party, and let the party bo
faithful to their trust, so that the people
will never have occasion to vegret their
verdict of the 3d of November,

ravages ; to protect citizens of foreign
birth from forcible restraint and in
voluntary servitude, and to enable al
iens to enter public lands under the

In tlie House of Representative an
