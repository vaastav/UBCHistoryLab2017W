SIEGEL TAKES
RAPATFORD
Says Clamor to Restrict
; Immigration Sponsored
By Propaganda.
?___
Isaac Siegel. of New York, a Republican
member of the House Immigration
Committee whose opposition
to the proposed measure for
.suspension of immigration resulted
in postponement of consideration by
the House yesterday, charged that
the measure is inspired by "the fear
of the large numbers of Jews coming
in." Mr. Siegel Is of Jewish extraction
himself.
He obtained postponement of .consideration
of the bill unfit Thursday
in order to prepare k mfeorlty
report on the measure. In contemplation
of his report, he pointed out
that the enforcement of the immigration
restriction on the Mexican
and Canadian borders was alreadv
! faulty owing to the failure to provide
an adequate number of inspectors.
Along the Canadian border, he said,
there were only 23 doctors to cover
76 points of entry.
Mr. Siegel charged that "Ford
propaganda" aimed against the
number of Jews alleged to be conii
ing into the country at present was
i responsible for the present agitation
I for the suspension of immigration,
j He said the majority report of the
committee read "just like Ford
I Propaganda." , ,
"We are raising a big cry against
the Bolsheviks and the Reds," Mr.
Siegel said, "while our big cities
actually show a decrease In their
crime statistics. There arc three

Personal Address
I Up until the very hour for de|
livery of President Wilson s annual
j message to Congress Tuesday
those closest to the President were
not sure hut that he would upset
I the program and go personally to
j the Capitol to make the address.
Joseph P. Tumulty himself was
j not certain. He came to the execu|
tive offices attired in the frock coat
and high silk hat so indispensable
j to a Presidential visit to the Capij
tol. A motor car was in readiness
and secret service men on hand.
In the message itself many found
| additional evidence of the President's
personal inclinations to de1
lfrer the message |n person. The
j tbnc of the message and the arrangement
of words indicated an
obvious plan for delivery in person,
i they argued.
! times the number of murders In
( Washington that there are in New
York in proportion to the population.
There is less crime in this
country than ever before, but there
is more publicity given to crime.

were less tinkering with immigration."

The majority of the member* have
