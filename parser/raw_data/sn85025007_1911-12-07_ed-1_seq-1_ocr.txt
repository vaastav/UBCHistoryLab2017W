Royal Couple Received by Viceroy

Officials.
RECEPTION IN SILKEN TENT.
Glittering Spectacle?Welcome of Down

Barred In Procession.
Delhi, India, Dec. 7.?While ar
tillery thundered :i royal salute and
musicians blarel the national anthem
King George and Queen Mary entered
Delhi today for the Durbar ceremony
Tuesday. The monarchs were re
ceived in stale by Viceroy Lord Hard
inge and Lady Hardinge and about
150 Rajahs, Maharajahs, Sultans and
other titled native".
A hastily constructed silken tent,
? replacing the one destroyed by in
cendiaries Tuesday, was the scene of
tho reception.
The voting Nizam of Haiderabad,
Premier Prince of India, was first
to be greeted,by the king and queen.
He approached the royal presence
gleaming in gold and silver.
The prince was followed by the
Maharajah of Kashmir, owner of the
"Earthly Paradise" at the foot of
the Himalayas and other dignitaries.'
The royal and viceregal parties then!
entered the state carriages for the!
procession through the ancient Mo
gul capital.
The royal escort consisted of Brit-j
ish and Indian cavalry and imperial |
cadet corps, most aristocratic body j
of soldiers in India, clad in blue and !
white uniforms and mounted on black
chargers. Behind mounted trumpet
. ers came the viceroy.
To the" American visitor the pro
cession of Indian princes was the
most imposing part of the show, the
wonderful assortment of colors, jew- j
ols, gold embroidery, magnificenti
horses and, state carriages providing)
a glittering spectacle.'
From the natives, however, thir
welcome was that of a down trodden
people to their masters.
??luch as George and Mary desired
to impress the natives' they barred
elephants from the parade, fearing
a stampede.
The government got Munshi Syed!
Ahmed, an Indian religious leader,
to explain to the natives in an offic
ial pamphlet, that elephant riding was
out of date.
Another feature of today's show
which was intended to impress tho
populace was the opening of the
"Shadi Darwasa" or liing's gate?in
tho old days used only by the Mogul
emperors. For the sake of extra
show the British, rulers drove
through this today.
At the spot where the British Gar
rison made its last stand in 1857
against the rebel army, addresses of
welcome were delivered by the gov-'
ernor and other representatives of,
British officialdom. The procession!
then made its way to the royal camp.

The first performance was the award

was taken until 1:80 p. in. when the j
Good Roads Association was willed to j

the neighborhood of $1.00,000 and he i
Sllggisted that the meeting request the, |

This resulted in a wide range of dis-|
cussion which tdiowed that thee was;
directly little opposition to bonds, butj<
a areat variety of opinion as to what, ;i
kind of roads were ueedtd. Mr. Hun-j
ter's motion was finally adopted to-i'
setlier with an additional one offered I
by Mr. Hall and subpoited by Mr.;
Church directing the president to re- :
quest the road board to call a meeting;
in oacli of the districts to discuss the |
question of bonding the districts for i
road purpose^ and present their views ji

- Chicago, Doc. 7.?"A farmer jury"|
probably will decide the fate of the'
ton millionaire Chicago packers;
brought m trial after eight years .of;
legal bushwhacking. It was apparent
today that the government intended
to challenge veniremen from Chicago j
and special attorney Sheean indicat
ed a pronounced preference for agri
culturists.
The defense has had no opportun
ity to show its preference. When \
court reconvened today there were
eleven tentative jurors in t he box?,
all subject to peremptory challenge,
by the government and not yet ques
tioned by the defense.
A wide difference of opinion a3 to:
(he Pherniasn Law was developed
amonj? veniremen today. Several
declared their opposition to any form
of governmental regulation for busi
ness and others who were violently
against the Sherman law.
The fact that the packing house
magnates are typical of "big busi
ness' and that the charge of crimin
al conspiracy to restrain trade in
meats is punishable by imprisonment
is causing the' government to exer
cise great care in picking jurors.
There was no abatement today in
the crowd before Judge Carpenter's
court room uud the same precaution
against newspaper photographer's
were exerted.
The millionaire defendants have
not felt the weight of the law very
heavily. Court attaches are under
orders to protect them from newspa
per photographers or reporters in '
federal building and the court,
has not exacted that they be present
during the trial?a very unusual
procedure. When court convened
today only a few of the beef barons
were on hand.

WASHINGTON LETTER.
i A statement denouncing the esti
mates made by the republican admin
istration l'or government expenditures
in 1913, as "misleading," was issued
today bv Rep. Fitzgerald (Dem^N*.
V.) chairman of the House Committee
on Approprjat ions.
According to Fitzgerald, the esti
mates, which on the face of t he ad
ministration's figures, were less than
$7fi0,000.000, will really amount to
over a billion. The additional quar
ter of a billion is made up of $200,
000.000 for the conduct of the postal
services to be paid out of the postal I
revenues and over $13,000,000 fori
public buildings. Jn lieu of the pub
lic building appropriation, the Treas
ury Department 'offered .? accept
lump sum of $3,000,000.
Fitzgerald asserted that the esti-;
mates for if) 13 show a real increase'
of over $20,000,000 over the esti-'
mates for 1912, instead of the saving
which appeared on the face of the!
figures.
"These estimates are somewhat i
shocking." continued Fitzgerald, "in j
view of the protestations of the ad
ministration of its determination to!
aid the movement to retrench public j
expenditures which is imperative if
the people are not to be overwhelmed ?
with additional taxes.
"The estimates are a notice to the j
Democratic cause that so far as the|
administration is concerned no help i
will be given to effect the economies j
admitted to be essential."
"Believing the high cost of living!
and continued Increase thereof makes
It impossible for men to devote their;
best energies because of nagging anxi- j
ety," Admiral T. J. Cowie, Paymaster1
General ot the Navy, in his annual >
report today asks salary increases for,
all of his employes.
Admiral Cowie urges Congress to}
open the Alaskan coal fields to pro-:
cure coul for the navy at lower cost.
He also tolls of an official "junkman"
employed to sort and sell scrap iron
at navy yards.
To support the naval establishment
Admiral Cowie says. SI IS.000,000

Nearly TOO sailors and marines'
were court martialed for desertion
last year, according to the report of
the Judge Advocate General of the.

discharged for lying, and three officers j

employes were discharged for fraud

SERIOUS SPLIT
IX COMMITTEE.;
|
Washington, Dec. 7.?A serious
-?plit in the McXamara Ways and
Means Committee became apparent to- j
day when President Frank M. Ryan of
the Bridge and Structural Iron Work-'
crs suddenly left the city and President!
Gompcrsof the A. F. of L. locked bis j
doors against newspaper men.
It is understood that Ryan disagreed i
with Goinpers as to the manner of dis
posiug of the remaining MeNamara de i
fense fund and that Gouipers and Ryan !
had a direct clash.
It is reoorted that, Gompers and ?ec- j
retary Morrison, of the A. F. of L.
undertook to upbraid Ryan for some
feature of his couduct and that Ryan
met ihem half way.
Tbe committee resumed its sessions
this afternoon, without Ryan, in an
effort to settle the policy of the organiza
tion rmJ the Question of the disposition
of the fund. Ryan's departure was
announced and was s surprise, to all
those connected with tbe situation.
He took a wes? hound traia at 11:55 j
presumably for Indianapolis.
What present would be better for
father, brother or college chum Mian a
pair of those excelling Brocton-Cu-Op

Valuable "Leads" in the Federal Inves
tigntion? Significant Language of
Labor Pumiration.
Los Angeles, Cal., Doc. 7.?"John
J. Mc.Vamara will tell nothing. He
is no squealer and will trade with
no one for favors. If the govern
ment asks him to testify he will sim
ply refuse to talk. What can they
do."
Clarence B-arrow. chief counsel
for McXamara made this statement
before the federal grand jury probe
opened here today. It had been ad
mitted by Oscar Lawler, assistant at
torney general in charge of the probe,
that he could not. compel the former
secretary and treasurer of the iron
workers union to testify, but he said
he would call him and ask him some
questions. It is expected that as
soon as the ordeai is over, both Mc
Xamaras will be rushed to San
Quentin prison.
it is the plan of Sheriff Hammell
to take both away from the jail Sat
urday, rush then: by automobile to
some way station on the Santa Fe
and get them on a special train, dis
charge them at some way station
and rush them by auto to the coast
completing the trip in a chartered
launch. Hammell freely admits the
fear that if ho took them to San
Francisco by regular route an at-1
tempt, would be made to do them I
harm.
The bribery matter in the McXam-'
ara case is in the hands of Judge;
Bordwell. He has summoned Dis-j
trict Attorney Fredericks and Deputy j
District Attorney Ford three times j
and told them plainly tiio're must bei
prosecutions. Fredericks, it is under
stood, attempted to argue and Bord
well called attention to the fact that'
a compromise would be compounding
a felony.
It is understood that when the j
hearing in the Franklin matter be
gins Monday every effort will be
mad* to ferret enough evidence so
that three persons prominently con
nected with the defense at the out
set of the trial will be involved.
The state will allege there were
two defense funds; one for actual
defense raised by the American Fed
eration of Labor, and a second secret
fund raised by the "inner circle," who
believe in "direct action."
The second alleged fund is the one
through which the prosecution hopes
to involve eminent labor leaders. At
torney Darrow bitterly declared to
day that lie was tired of insinuations
and would drive the stale into the :
open as soon as the Franklin case !
is settled.
Indianapolis, Jud., Dec. 7.?Valu
able "leads" in the Federal investi
gation of the nation-wide dynamit-j
ins conspiracy are believed to have ;
been uncovered here today in "The
Bridgoman," a monthly magazine of
the International Association of i
Bridge and Structural Iron Workers,
of which J. J. .Mc.Vamara was editor.
Scores of items, similar to the follow
ing and said to have been written by
J. J. .McNamara are found in the files
of the magazine:
"Detroit, .Mich.?Large noise heard |
in this vicinity last night which woke
up some people."
It is asserted that practically every
dynamiting in which conditions point
to the implication of the McXamaras
Is referred to in statements in "The
Bridgeman" similar to the above.
The absence or ordinary safeguards
in hiding their dynamiting operations
has caused Dr. J. X. Hurty, secretary
of the Indiana Board of Health to
assert that he believes the .McXam
aras are degenerates.
The federal authorities today re-!
ceived information that the last of!
the dynamite which has been con
nected with the dynamiting opera
tions of the McXamaras by the auth
orities is now on its way here for use
in the government probe. The dyna
mics was shipped from Tiffin, Ohio/
where it was found near the home
of the father of Ortie McManigal.
United States District Attorney;
Charles TV. Miller, in charge of the
federal investigation here announced
today that he expected to devote all
of his time to the dynamiting investi
; Uncle of Miss Clara Turner Dies at
Alexandria Hospital Yes
terday Evening.
! Mr. M. R. Miller, uncle of Miss
| Clara Turner, who is playing at the
j Opera House, died at the Alexandria
j Hospital at 7o'clock yesterday evening.
Mr. Miller had been suffering from a
| complication of diseases and bad been
I in the hospital since the first day the
(company arrived in Alexandria. He
was 70 years of age and had been in I he
theatrical businc** continuously sirn-ei
he was 10 years old, except during the j
civil war?he having served on the
northern side.
, Mr. Miller was born in Homer, N.,
i Y., but naturally in his profession has!
traveled the country over. He i3 a,
| member of the Springfield, Mass.,
( Lodge of Eagles.
Two daughters of Mr. Miller's, who
? are also in the theatrical profession,'
1 are at present traveling and their exact'
! whereabouts' are unknown. Effortsi
to reach them by telegraph have
I proved futile. One of the especially
*ad features of Mr. Miller's illness and i
death was that Miss Turner and her
associat i?, with whom Mr. Miller had
been connected for the past ten years,
have been playing every night with i
! the knowledge that his recovery was:
j impossible and that their friend and;
j relative lay suffering while they as-;
sumed the mask of gayety.
The death of Mr. Miller will cause ?
no change in the plaos of the company I
1 and the performances will be given at;
the Opera House as usual, the busi
? ness ottering no alternative.
Mr. Miller, probably with the 'eeling j
I that he was a citizen of the United
I States aud of no particular part of it, ;
j always requested that in the event of
(bis death that he be buried where his j
| demise occurred and bis wishes will be J

The funeral will take place at 10 j
o'clock tomorrow morning from B. j

MESSAGE OF
THE PRESIDENT, j
Washington, Dec. 7.?Tlie message,
: of President Taft on foreign relations!
was transmitted to Congress today, j
The document gives an exhaustive
'history of negotiations between the;
United States and other nations dur
! ing the past year. He reviews at
length our relations with South Am
erican republics?especially Mexico,
and the recent, turmoils in that coun-j
i try. Th?> President expresses friend-;
linoss for Mexico which he says has,
; been fully recognized by the people
j of that country. Me then reviews at i
j large conditions now existing be
tween the United Slates and China
and other nations of the Far East,
and refers to the now Japanese treaty
and other matters of recent history.
!
Our relations with Europe are shown
to be cordial. In his reference to
I Russia the President says:
"By direction of the State Depart
ment our ambassador to Russia has
recently been having a series of con
; forences with the Minister of Foreign;
I Affairs of Russia with a view to se
curing a clearer understanding and
construction of the treaty of 1832 be
tween Russia and the United States,
I
and the modification of any existing
; Russian regulations which may be f
found to interfere in any way with the
; full recognition of the rights of Am-'
erican citizens under this treaty. 1
i believe that the government of Rus
sia is addressing itself seriously to
the need of changing the present
practice under the treaty, and that
sufficient progress has been made to
warrant the continuance of those
conferences in the hope that there
may soon be removed any justification
of the complaints of treaty violation
now prevalent in this country.
"I expect that immediately after
Christmas recess I shall be able to!
make a further communication to
Congress on this subject."
