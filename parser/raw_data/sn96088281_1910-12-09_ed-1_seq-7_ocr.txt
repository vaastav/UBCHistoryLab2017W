the tariff. The president's state
ment that the tariff board would not
be ready to report during the present
session, but that It would probably
report before the next congress
caused a buzs of excitement.
The recommendation for a revision
of the tariff, schedule by schedule,
and that it be treated more as a busi
ness question, the rates based upon
actual difference In foreign and home
production, was closely fol
lowed. Considerable significance

latlon. The whole message, tho con
greRsmen say, Is an excellent biiRlnesp
document. Rome of the democrats
and Insurgents criticize the message
because there Is little reference to the
high cost of living and other matters
which have agitated the public mind
the last year or two.
The Interest of the congressmen
In the reading of the message noon
declined and shortly after It had be
gun the members, for the most part
! carrying their printed copies with
them, strolled Into tho cloak rooms.
They discussed the message freely
(and were evidently Interested In It,
I but within an' hour after the reading
began only about 50 members re
Imalned In the house and their con
versation became so loud that the
voice of the reading clerk was
drowned out.
In the senate the same exodus be
gan, the senators evidently prefer
ring to read the message In their
committee rooms.
In one group were Senators La
Follette, Cummins, Clapp and Drls-
,tow, talking animatedly, while the
i reading proceeded. Senator Hale
conversed with 8enator Guggenheim
j and Senator Terrlll, of Georgia,
I who has Just taken his seat,
j The senators generally were eva
sive when asked to discuss the mess
age. The democrats and progres
sives apparently npproved of most
of the message; the greatest exrep
tlon being taken by them to the ship
subnldy reference. The regulars
generally approved the messnRe, but
considered It. futile.
