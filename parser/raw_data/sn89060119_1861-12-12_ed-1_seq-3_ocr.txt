•ynopri* rf the President’s Message, which
is something too lengthy 'for publication I
in oar paper without abridgement. 1
Olic thing the Message is very decided
about—there is to be no peace as long as
the North will famish men and means to
carry on the war How long it may be
able or wHHag to do this, remains to bo
mob, bat it would not much surprise us
if ao effort was made before the adjourn*
ent of the present Congress in the diree- 1
tioa of peace. It is beginning to be pret
ty generally realised by the commercial
interest at the North, that mr is a rcry
costly luxury and that the subjugation of
the South, is. to say the bast, very pro- ,
Hematics). Patriotism did not begin the j
war nsr will it end it. We predict, that
the fast effoli. far peace from Republican '
quarteff *ill come from (he great city of
Kow York, The Report of Mr. Sccretu-1
ry Chase goca to allow that the Govcm
lu nt is already embarrassed for want of
means and is greatly in need of another;
loan. Wall Street will tc Called upon ;
again sod then we may expect to hear
"’ill street talk as it never talked before.
Mr. Lincoln, however, appears to he of
goJ cheer. He is putting the "ma-'
chine” through at a terrible rale and with
n prodigious flourish. To what end he is ;
running it so fast, we know not, except
that wc know he is running it very deeply

Oot* Hick’s tfsssige-
Wo publish on our first page the mes- ‘
•age of Oov. Hicks to the Legislature
now in S'laion at Annapolis. If His Ex
cellency is to he believed, it i to his mas
terly statesmanship alone that the good
people of Maryland are indebted for ex-j
emptioo from the evils which have over- :
taken their contumacious brethren in
Missouri, Kentucky and Virginia. With
the pr< science of a prophet and the wisdom !
of all the saga's cornbioed, he foresaw eve
ry thing and provided for every thing at
isaSl sit months before any thing came to j
ri. HU patriotism was only surpassed I
his sagacity and wisdom. Attempts
P intimidate him. but the con* |
found out that th*y had t<
•a who, like tho Old Guurd. |
could never he persuaded to
It was next attempted to
♦•ajole him, but he was proof to all as- i
saults. Like (he Iron Luke, he “stood j
four-square to , ail the winds that blew.’
Indeed, if His Excellency u not mistaken, 1
It is Thomas Holliday Hicks alone and,
exclusively that has saved us all from per-!
ditjon, and this too in opposition to our
wishes aid in spite of our exertions. Bui
wc anticipate. To those who wish to
know exactly ‘what His Excellency has
done for us and exactly how be has done
it, wc recommend a quiet perusal of hi.s
message. It is neither very long nor very
stupid.
War nod other News
During the past week, affairs along (In
line of the Potomac are reported uuebang- j
ed by the Washington press and other j
Federal organs, hut the outside reports are of |
a character that tend to create a different |
impression. It is stated, upon good au-1
thorny, that there were two considerable j
engagements fought on Friday and Satur-;
day last, along the line of the belligerents, I
in both of which the Federal* suffered sc-;
verely. Of the result of the two fights'
wo have' bo report, other than the official;
9iltu< € that haa succeeded them. There '
is also a report of a skirmish on the up-!
)-cr Potomac, in which, it is stated, the j
Confederates were dispersed, though we 1
are informed by authority from the imme
diate vicinity of the fight, that it resumed
in a heavy Federal loss if not in a Feder
al reverse. A Tnion paper. puUUbed in
Cincinnati, reports a aeries of henvy skir
laLhing along the whole line of the army
*f the Potomac, in which, it is conceded,
•ha Federal-: have been very generally
beaten. The Confederates arc reported
to have advanced, during the past week,
in the direction of Alexandria, and to
have occupied the village of Allendale,
but the movement is not reguarded as in
dicative.of a general forward movement.
Kumdra of a general engagement, in this
quarter; mtiU numerous, hut conflict

thought to be probable that Me
i'leUau will go into Winter quarters
without ■huxnrdmg a pitched buttle. Otn.

Id Weetem VtrjiuU, the eamjuigs hw
bers brought to a dose in consequence of
the evwiey of the weather, and Oen. i
liuaenorans has gone into Winter quarters
at Wheeling.
Southern reports from Missouri show
thst great sclivity prevails among the
Military, and, that Gen. Price ia making
strenuous exertions to acquire dominion
over the State. It is slated, in the
Memphis Jralaneht , that Gen. Rains
has attacked Montgomery's command and
**cnl it to pieces,” and taken Montgomery
prisoner Also, that Ben McCulloch
. has surrounded Gen. Sigel’s divUi-u.
' which will be either compelled l* sur
render or suffer the same late of Mont
gomery’s Jay ha wkerv. Price i? reported to
jbe advancing upon St. Ijouh, and (o be
j daily receiving large reinforcements from
the people in the countb-a through which
be is passing. These statcim nts. howev
er, are not Relieved at Washington, and
, as they have not received the official pai.c
tiou, have not very generally appeared in
the “loyal” press. Federal reports show
a very different condition of affairs, and
: claim that Price's forces are diminishing
rather than increasing, and that Ib-u. Mc
-1 Culloeb. instead of having surrounded Si
gel. is making rapid slides f>r the Ar
kansas border. From the same source,
! wc learn tlmt the Federal* now have a
J force of 7.’>,000 men at St. Louis, and. if
! this be correct, it u not likely that Gen.
Price Las any designs upon this post.
The Hews from Kentucky ia exciting
j nnd full ol interest. The Federal* are
• reported to be making a gem-nil advance,
from St. Louis, Cairo and Louisville,
upon Columbus and Buckner’s forces at
i Bowling Green. The combined Federal
1 force in this quarter is estimated as high
jhs 265,000 im.n, with which they ex
! pect to be able to speedily crush out
the “rebellion” in Kentucky. The C* n
i federate force is also estimated at a very
j high figure, and they claim to he able
to hold Columbus against 75,000 u.cn
: It is stated .hul Buckner will be attack
! od, in a few days, with an overwhelm
ing force, and the Federal* express
themselves quite sanguine of b-:ig able
to drive him out of Kentucky. Th
Federal General, Schocff, had been com
i polled to re treat, before a superior fort e
|of Confederates under Zollicoff r, w ho,
it is stated, was marching on Somcrst t
{ with a fqrce of 10,000 men. The rr
i port, as to the Federal force in Kt ti
lt ucky. is no doubt exaggerated, hut it
iis quite certain that there has been an
| immense force concentrated in this quar-
J ter, and that Kentucky will be the thea
i tre of active war the present Winter.—
1 The West has put forth her full strength
iin this content, .and, as she has mu-b.
l at stake, will no doubt battle haid for
j the supremacy. If the Mississippi is to
■be opened at all to Western trade, it
j can only tc clone by a successful march
‘ to New Orleans, and to that end. a d* -
cided victory in Kentucky must be gain
ed. On the other hand, the Confcde
-1 rates have every incentive to valor and
I every cause for resistance, for the in
vasion of their homes, if not their inde
pendence, depends upon a defeat of this
expedition. We may, therefore, look
for some hard fighing in Kentucky, and
may henceforth, we think, rather look
to that quarter than the hanks of the
Potomac, for the grand buttle upon
which the issues of the present war arc
to be decided.
There ia nothing new from Port Roy-;
al or Fortress Monroe of a character to in- !
terest our readers. At Charleston and j
Savannah . the Confederates are r. ported
to have a large force, which consists of
volunteers from different section* of the
South and not drawn from any of the or
ganised commands heretofore in the field, i
The citizens residing upon tho coast in
South Carolina and Georgia have applied
the torch to their cotton and rice crops
and, in many ii. stances, to their dwelling.-
rhat nothing of value may fall into the !
hands of tho enemy. Tybec island has *
been evacuated by’ the Federal*, and Fort
Pulaski, although threatened by a large ;
naval force, had not been attacked up to ;
the date of tho Litest dispatches from that j
quarter.
The- fight at Pensacola had non been re- j
suiued Up to late last week, though it was
thought quite probable that it might he j
resumed at any moment The late fight |
there resulted in no d cisive advantage to
either side, and may be regarded rather 1
as a useless waste of ammunition, then an
u? a military operation of importance.
Congress ha*, as jet, done nothing in
the way of legislation upon the leading •
questions of the day, hut the indications |
are that an early attempt will be made to <
obtain a test vote upon the questions of ;
negro emancipation, the confiscation act •
and other mischievous projects of tberadi- :

THE PHTSILENI’S MESSAGE.
The im-ssag • opens with a recognition of
j * sitting “political troubles,” but expresses
gratitude to G-*<] tor the prosperous bar
, vests and general health.
In nl nliCu to the acti-m of the secc-_
ded Stales, the President anticipates ttnC
possibility of an appeal for foreign aid,
or of for ign in’erpoaitio:,; and though ad
i mining the n .n-intv rlbrenco of European
powers hitherto, it is deemed expedient
to suggest the alining and fmtifyi g of
the Nuitln rn |>*- *:% and the lake coasts to
be j*ri pared for any contingency in the
I future.
Suggestion is also made for co-opcra
j tinti wall Kentucky and certain districts
iot Tennessee and North Carolina against
the seceded Stales, and the building of a
railroad in aid of the purpose,
j Indemnity is recommended in the case
|of the British .-hip I‘ei thshire, for illegal
detention under the blockade.
The recognition of llayti aud Liberia is
J approved.
Tin revenue from all son re* & for the.
i fiscal year ending Jun ; 3<\ 1801, was j

I The recommendations of the Secretary |
,of the Navy for ccitain impro\emcnts in j
. that arm of the service are urged upon '
congressional attention,
i Vacancies existing on the bench of the i
! Supreme Couit are referred to. and delay j
' in appointments ascribed to an unwilling*
ness to do injustice to tho South; at the!
j same lime the [’resident regards the North
jus having a sup* rir claim. Certain J
' modifications in the syst**ni of the Su
; picnic Court are recoin mended
I The revision or codification of the acts

; authorities of the United States, in the
i k ceded Slates, is recommended, especial*
|ly for the summary restitution in the
case of repudiated debts. Authority t

ih*rise the frevdom .of slaves coming,
within the sooj*e of military action nn ;
the pan of United States, and the,
J acquisition of (ertiiury for their culouisa* .
tiou.
ihe President states that be has pre
11* rretl the bhwkade of the Southern ports
to :he clusinir ot tu same, as authorised
• by the act of the last Congress.
Ketvieuce is mauc to the belief on the
part of the .'-•-ulh that they would have the
. sympathy of a large portion of the people <
• north of Mason and Dixon *s line. The >
error Is said to hav exploded, while
Delaware, Marylrnd, Missouri aud Keu
tucky are claimed to have vindicated their
loyalty to the Federal government.
In reference to the advance of the
Uuicn cau j e in the Southern Stales, the
President says
i The insurgents confidently claimed a
strong support from north of Mason and
Dixon’s line, and the friends of the Un*
] ion were not free from apprehension on
’ the point. This, however, was settled
k definitely and ru the right sida.

j Als ,we have obtained a f-Mting at
( each of the isolated points on the southern
e**ast of Halt* ras. Port Royal, Tyhie
Uland, near Savannah, and Ship Island;
and we likewise have some general ac
counts of popular movements in Iwhalf of
the Union in North Carolina and Tennes
see. These things demonstrate that th>*
cause of the Union is advancing steadily
southward.
There is iu the Message a grateful
tribute to General Scott, and a splendid
, reference to General McCI liau. “It is
ja fortunate circumstance” says the Presi
dent. “that neither in council or country
j was there any difference of opinion as to
i the proper person to be selected” as Geii
i er.il bcott’s successor. “The retiring
| Chief repeatedly expressed hi.* judgment
,in favor f Gen. McOleiian, and in this
the nation seemed to give an unanimous
j concurrence.” The Message concludes
I as follows:
If continues to develop that the insur
rection is largely, if not exclusively, a
war upon the fir.-t principles of popular
1 government—the rights of the people.
: Conclusive evidence of this is found in the
•j most grave and maturely considered pub
lic document*, as welt as in the general
i tone of the insurgent*. In those docu
i motifs w fin-l the abridgement of the ox
i isfing right of suffrage, aud flic denial to
I'Hho people of all right to participate in the
1 selection of public officers, except tho leg
islative, boldly advocated, with labored
arguments, to prove that large control of
! the people in government is the source of
all political evil. Monarchy itself i*
so in- times hinted at as a possible refuge
from the power of the people.
In my present position, I could scarce
ly be justified were I to omit raising a warn- ,
ing voice against this approach of return
ing despotism.
It is not needed nor fitting here, that a
general argument should he made in favor
of popular institutions. But there is one j
point, with its connections, not so hack- !
neyed as most others, t * which I ask a
brief attention ; it is the effort to place j
| capital on an npual f.Hiting with, if not,
, above, labor, in the structure of the i
•Government It is assumed that labor j
|is available only in connection with cap- j
; itul, —that nobody labors unless some- j
‘ body cl*e, owning capital somehow, by
Jibe use of it. induces him to labor.— |
: This assumed, it is next considered
whether it is best that capital .-hall hire)
laborers, and thus induce them to work
by their own consent. **r buy them, and
jdiivc them to it, without th- ir cctiM-iit
j Having proceeded so far, it is naturally
jcuududtd that all laborers are either'
| hired laborers or what we cull slaves ; |
ami further, it is assumed that, whoever !
jis once a hired laborer is fixed in that |
: condition for life Now, there is no'
- such relation between capital and labor
j assumed, nor is there any such thing as
j a freeman being fixed fur life in the |
condition of a hired laborer. Both these |
! assumptions arc false, and all inferences '
i from them are groundless. Labor is
■ prit.r to ami indcj>eml-iit of capital.—
I Capital.is only the fruit of labor, aud could
j never have existed if labor had not Hist J
existed. Labor ia the superior of capi- j
Jtal, and deserves much the higher con
sideration, Capital has its rights, which
arc as worthy of protection as any other
rights. Not is it denied that there is,
and probably always will be, a relation j
beeween labor and capital, producing
mutual benefits. The error is in assum
ing that the whole labor of the commu
nity exists within that relation. A f**w
men own capital, and that few avoid la-'
bor themselves, and with their capita)
hire, or buy a not her few to labor for;
(hew. A large majority belong to m-itb- -
er class, neither work fur others nor
have others worked fur them. In most ;
of the Southern Slates a majority of the
whole people of all colors are neither
idares nor masters, while in the North
ern a large majority are neither hirer*
i nor hired. Men with their families,
; wives, son*, <*ud daughters, work for
thcwaelves on their farms, in their bou*-
; e, aud in their shop*, taking the wb /ic
product to (heiiiMcKcs. and asking no j
. favors ul capital on tin* uue baud, nor (
iof hired laborers or Mates on the other j
It is not forgot!vn that a considerable
number of persons mingle their own la
bor with their capital—that w, they la
bor with their own bands, mnd also buy;
or hire other* to labor for them; but
thir ’is only a mixed and n<*t a distinct
, elate. No principle stated ia disturbed
> by the existence of this mixed claw.
Again, as ha? already been said, there
is not of u<-cessiy any such thing as the
free hired laborer being fixed to that con
dition for life. Many independent men.
everywhere in thc>e State*, a few years
bark in their live?, were hired laborers.— j
The prudent, penniless beginner in the
world labor? for wage? awhile, save? a sur- j
plus with which to buy tools or land fur|
himself then labors on his own account '
another while, and at length hires an- j
other new beginner to help him. This i? |
the just and generous and prosperous ?ys- j
tem which open* the way to all, give*
hope to all. and consequently energy and j
pi ogres* and improvement of condition to;
all. No men living arc more worthy to
be trusted than those who toil up from
poverty ; none less inclined to take or
touch aught which they have not honestly '
‘ earned Let them beware of surrenduring
a political power which they alr?ady pos
sess. and which, if surrendered will sure- j
ly he used to close the door of advancement
against such as they, and to fix new disa-;
bilities and burdens upon them till all of
liberty shall ie lost.
From the first taking of our national
census to the last is seventy years, and we i
find our population at tbt end of the pe-1
rind eight times as great as it was at the 1
beginning. The increase of those other i
things which men deem desirable has been
greater. We thus have at one view what
the popular prim iple applied to govern -j
ment through the machinery of the States i
and the Union has produced in a given
time, and also what, if firmly maintained, j
it promises for the future. There are al- '
ready among us those who, if the Union I
be preserved, will live to see it contain 1
two hundred and fifty millions The
struggle of to-day is not altogether for to
day, it is for a vast future also.
