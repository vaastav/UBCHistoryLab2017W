THE MESSAGE.
President Arthur's message is a plain,
straightforward document. Its diction is
simple, and there will be no difficulty ex
perienced on the part of any intelligent
citizen in comprehending it and arriving at
the opinion of the Chief Magiutrate of the
country. It cannot lie said to be a bid for
popularity, and has none of the ear-marks
of the mere politician. Its chief value will
be found in the clearness with which he
places before Congress the public business
which should engage the attention of the
country.
Our relations with foreign powers are re
ported as entirely amicable, the only fric
tion is with Spain concerning the proceed
ings of Cuban authorities, so far as they
aSfect our trade, aDd the settlement of
claims of our citizens against the Spanish
Government, the latter power having been
very negligent in the payment of awards.
The discrimination on the part of Eu
ropean Government- against certain of our
meat-food products has been removed, ex
cept in Germany, In another part of the
message he advißcs retaliatory measures as
a remedy for unjust discriminaticns'pgainst
our products, and the same remedy, we
think, he might well have advised to be
applied in the case of Germany.
He advises a firm stand against the send
ing to our stores of pauper emigrants from
the British Islands.
The fisheries rights of our people should
receive attention with a view to opening to
us the fishing grounds of British and Rus
sian North America under enduring and
just conditions.
A Consulate-General should be estab
lished at the Bulgarian capital for the pro
tection of American citizens.
The President, without directly advising
it, very strongly intimates that it would
be an act of wißdom to ratify the new
commercial treaty with Mexico, now before
the Senate for approval.
He will not recognize the Iglcsias Gov
ernment established by Chile in Peru, until
the will of the people of Peru is manifest
In its favor.
Concerning the treaty with Hawaii, it is
his opinion that while the convention may
be modified wherever it works injury, the
abandonment of the treaty should not be
t'.iought of. lie is convinced, as must be
a.l thoughtful citiz.ns who have candidly
examined the matter, that charges of
frauds and abases under the treaty have
been exaggerated.
The President very significantly points
out the unwisdom of any coercive measures
to give American manufacturers in China
special privileges there, and adds a con
sideration that is forceful, when be says :
" The transference to China of American
capital for engagement there of Chinese
labor would in eft set inaugurate a competi
tion for the control of markets now sup
plied by our home industries. Lang ago
the <>.::■ -I'mov pointed out that we
.might have to encounter Chinese competi
tion of Chinese manufactures in Chins,
that would prove more perplexing than
Chinese manufactures by Chinese produced
in the United States, Regarding the vio
lation of the Chinese Immigration Act by
Cninese, be gives notice that measures
have been taken to ascertain the facts, and
he expresses the belief that China will be
brought to co-operate with the Coiled
States in securing .'. faithful < _r-i rvancc of
iW.
His indorsement of the International
A'rican A.-.- relation scheme for promoting
v ■.restricted trade and residence in the '
C >ngo Valley is in the line of wise fore- !
The warmth winch he urges upon Con
g-ess a grant of authority to the Executive
t > retaliate for the vexations restrictions
p'.aced in the way of export duties and tax
ation upon our trade in the Spanish West
Indies, Brazil, Turkey and other countries
is certainly commendable. The simplest
method of bringing* these countries to
terms is to give them liberal potions of
their own medicine. Thus, when a coun
try unjustly discriminates against the en
try of American food product?, and by
technical exactions hinders and embarrasses
our trade, the United States should apply
like restrictions upon their commerce at
our own ports. It will be heroic treat
ment, but the disease demands it. This
journal, as far back as April last, urged
retaliation as the proper remedy for the
selfish and unjust exclusion of American
products from foreign ports, and the press
of the country generally held like radical
▼lews.
The most important section of the finan
cial division of the message is that relat
ing to the deposited securities the na
to the deposited eecarities of the na
tional banks. He opposes the substitu
tion of foreign for home securities, passes
the proposition for a new issue of low in
terest-bearing long-time bonds to replace
the 3 per cents being called in, and favors a
plan for averting threatened contraction of
bank circulation by the repeal of the law
6k circulation by the repeal of the law
laying a tax upon the circulation, and by a
new regulation permitting the banks to is
sue notes for an amount equal to 00 per
c ;nt. of the market value, instead as now
of the face value of the deposited bonds.
Thus, a bank now issuing $000 of notes on
a deposited 3 per cent, of §1,000, could
ins, a bank now issuing $900 of notes on
deposited 3 per cent, of §1,000, could
deposit a 4 or 41 bond of 81,000 face value,
but last year worth, say, 20 per cent,
premium, or $1200 market value, and issue
notes for $I,OSO. But for a clearer under
standing of this preposition we must refer
to the Comptroller's report. Mr. Knox,
in speaking of this proposition, refers to the
market value basis, as being measured by
the lowest market price during the year
X lowest market price during the year
previous to the deposit. Thus it will be
seen, that as the bonds approach maturity
and decline in premium value until they
reach par at redemption, the note circula
tion would be gradually contracted until
it would cease to exceed the face value of
the bonds, as in the first instance, while
the Government would be possessed of
security sufficient to protect holders of the
notes. his plan would relieve the banks,
and maintain the circulation at about its
present aggregate. There is virtue in the
scheme, but we incline to the belief that
an issue of low-interest long-time bonds
which the banks might deposit, would be
less intricate in detail, and more beneficial
to the country, although it would involve
the payment of a premium for the 41-per
cents. But would cot this be equalized by
the lessened interest on the new bonds?
He advises that the trade dollar be re
ceived by the Treasury and Mints as bull
ion, at a small advance over market price.
This is a recommendation that will cer
tainly be adopted. His review of the con
dition of the Treasury it is unnecessary to
refer to, further than to say that the esti
mated surplus for ISS4-5 will exceed $60,
--000,000. He thinks still further reductions
of the tariff receipt; may be wisely made, but
he does not advise at the present session
of Congress any large diminution of the
national revenues, as the late legislation in
that direction has not yet been thoroughly
tested.
The President's references to the War
Department include a word encouraging to
militia organizations, and urge the erection
and strengthening of coast defenses, which
are now deplorably weak. He will cer
tainly be seconded in this suggestion by
the best thought of the country. .So, too,
with regard to the navy, he approves of
the construction of ships of war now going
on, and advises strongly further steps in a
like direction.
Concerning the postal service, he gives
nis opinion against the building of Govern
ment telegraph lines because of the in
crease of the civil list that would neces
sarily result, but gives some support, with
out positive indorsement, to the plan to
hire the carriage of postal telegrams. He
advises Government supervision over inter
state telegraphic communication, and
urges a reduction of drop-letter postage to
one cent, a recommendation Congress will
unquestionably adopt.
He advises the establishment of a civil
government for Alaska, the protection of
forest growth on public lands, and the ex
ercise, so far as it has constitutional au
thority, of the power of Congress to pro
tect the. people in their interstate traffic
over railways from acts of injustice, at the
Mine time keeping in view that railway
corporations have a right to demand profit
able return upon their investments, and a
reasonable freedom in their regulations.
These expressions concerning railroads are
conservative, and cannot be seized upon as
the text for the radicil and intemperate
renewal of assaults upon the corporate in
terests of carriers.
He gives the experiment in civil service
reform cordial indorsement, wisely advise
that in the case of Utah and the polygamy
question there shall be had a repeal of th
Act upon which the existing Government
depends — the resumption by the National
Legislature of the entire political control
of the Territory, and the establishment of
a Commission, with such powers and duties
as shall be delegated to it by law.
With a few words urging adequate legis
lation on the question of " Presidential suc
cession," and an urgent sentence in favor of
a law permitting the President to veto sin
gle items in bills of appropriation, he con
cludes the message, which we think will
be received by the country with satisfac
tion as a whole, and certainly speak
strongly of the sincerity of the President
while it also testifies to his caution.
THE CONTRACT KEPT.
About a year ago the Supervisors of
Sacramento county, by a universally popu
lar resolution, proposed that it the State
would contribute .J40.000 towa.'d the coat
of erecting an exposition building for the
State Agricultural Society — the city giving
also a large portion — the county would con
tribute to the same purpose the entire pro
ceeds of the proposed sale of the old Pa
vilion, the property of the county. The.
new structure has been completed, and is
admit! the most superior exposition'
ha!! west of the Ohio river. Bat it has
not been furnished. The sum for its con
struction left nomargin tor engines, boilers,
scats and other necessary furniture that
must be p'.sced before a fair can be held.
When the bill for the appropriation was
before the Legislature its opponents were
!oud in declaring that it was a scheme to
involve the State ; that Sacramento city
and Sicramtnto county would not keep
their contracts, and that the State would
be called upon to make up a large de
ficiency. The old Pavilion has just been
sold, and realized half as much again as it
was estimated it would bring. This result
was accomplished by delay of sale after
frequent offerings at auction, and by the
good management of the Board of Super
visors, which has just resolved to turn over
the entire proceeds of the sale to the new
Pavilion fund. This ia right action, and
will prove to the people of the State that
the contract has been kept, the building
erected and paid for to the last cent, and
no deficiency created for the State to meet,
1 while there is a fair sum on hand toward
fitting the structure for use, the Society
probably being able to supplement the
amount as may be necessary. Sacrarrento
city and Sacramento county have kept
faith, and if there ia still need to prepare
the structure completely for the next State
Fair, and the Society needs aid, this peo
pie, we venture to say, will not be found
waiting in public spirit for the exigency.
There is a second youth for man, belter
and holier than his first, if he will look on
and not look back.

Director of both roads, and had stock standing ii

[SECOND DISPATCH.]
Santa Ko<*a, December sth.— After recess W. V.
Huntington testified that the authorized capital of
the Northern Railway was $3,400,000, at par, and
that £4,500,000 had been issued to the W. D. Com

£. EL Miller, Jr., was then cilled as a witness and
sworn, but owing to the absence of some records
which are expected to-night, he was temporarily
withdrawn after a few preliminary questions.
Plaintiff's counsel stated to the Court that they
had some 800 letters from Mr. Huntington to Mr.
Colton, which they desired toe ffer in evidence, as
proof of the confidential relations which existed be
tween the parties. The reading of the first one,
dated Oct ber S, 1^74, provoked an argument of al
most two hours' duration, and led the Court to sug
gest that matter affecting only third parties, or such
as were purely sensational, be omitted in the read
ing of letters. Plaintiff's counsel agreeing so to do,
the defendants' objection to the introduction of the
letters, in whole or in part, was overruled, and an
exception noted.

IT AH.
Mormon View of Arthur's Message-
Salt Lake, December sth.— The .>>_«_, the Mor
mon organ, in a leader says: "The President's
message will be bailed by a hireling clergy with
pleasure, and receive an amount of popular sup
port. It is not shown in what way the destruction
of our local government would affect polygamy. Ihe
plural marriages of Mormons are not recognized by
Territorial laws, and could not be dissolved ly Com
missions, edicts, armies or any other earthly power.
Tluy are ecclesiastical, perpetual, eternal, until the
Mormons become recreant to tht ir faith with high
heaven. These unions are recognized by the Al
mighty Being, who established them for the benefit
of His people and the fullness of His glory. The
President's marks on Utah polygamy will not add
force too his message nor credit to bis statesman
ship. They are a s< pto bigots and a breath to the
flame of popular pission. It is doubtful if it will
have a pract'eal bearing on Congress. It will cer
tainly create no commotio* among the God-fearing
people of Utah." The same. paper throws a sop to
the Democrats, and hopes they will defeat the meas
ure in the House.

Victoria, December sth.— A severe snow-storm is
reported at Yale. A fire occurred there Friday last,
at the corner of Dougias and Regent streets. Five
Chinese houses were burnt.
Parliament was opened by the Governor. There
was a very large attendance. An amended bill, em
bodying the agreement with Canada relative to the
Island Railway, Graving Dock and railway lands of
the Province was submitted ; congratulations were
expressed upon the increased prosperity of the
country' ; that the Dominion Railway lauds on the
mainland are open to settlement; that a ferry
bridge is to be Duilt across Thompson river, and
that the coal mines continue to increase in import
ance. There is little change in the gold mining in
dustry, but prospects are favorable. The attention
of the Dominion Government is drawn to the neces
sity of a ship-of-war being retained at Es-juinialt;
also a claim to share in the benefits of the Halifax
fishery award ; also, the appointment of more In
diss agents to control the Indian settlements. Ihe
Chinese question has been discussed. A practical
remedy just now is to encourage white immigration
of a class which will exclude Chinese. A Judge is
to reside at New Westminster and one also on the
mainland, for the Clinton judicial district. A resident
County Court Judge is to he appointed for Cariboo
una Lillocot, 'Ihe kinetic asylum is insufficient
and the subject of the custody oi prisoners requires
earnest consideration. An exploratory survey of
Kooieney district is to be made. The Government
experiences a loss in the regiment of the Marquis
of Lome and his royal consort, and recog
nizes the appointment of Lord Lansdowne as Gov
ernor-General. The Mineral Act of 1882 is disal
lowed by the Dominion Government. It is neces
sary to consider the mining laws, and a bill to that
end will be introduced. The Kcoteuey Railway Act
requires an amendment, and measures will be sub
mitted to Parliament to consider whether the price
of lauds acquired for speculation purpose should
not be increased, and a measure to regulate the cut
ting of timber upon certain lands bo as to derive a
revenue therefrom. ■■- ,--,
Rei-Orts from Sumas state that a man named Gil
len, foreman of the Canadian Pacific Railway Works,
was murdered in his tent. He was shot and had his
throat cut. He was supposed to have had money.
Two of tie gang suspected have left.
Tin' body of a man named Creighton, with his
throat cut, was found in the woods near Maple EUdge
Saturday. It is supposed to Lethe work of China
men. Creighton had secured the contract for clear
ing land at Maple Ridge, which Chinamen were anx
ious to secure. The police have been sent over to
investigate the utt-ir.
Tenders are called for the completion of the grav
ing docks. A deposit is required of $7,500.
.Yhea a middle-aged traveler for a Chi
cago tobacco house arrived in that city he
was met at the station by a pretty young
girl, who flung herself on his bosom and
kissed him all over the face and head.
Then she looked up in his countenance and
shrieked, " You are not my pa," and llew
away like a bird and hid herself in the
thicket of people. He was, sure enough,
not her pa, and when he reached his room
at the hotel be discovered that his breast
pin was gone.
