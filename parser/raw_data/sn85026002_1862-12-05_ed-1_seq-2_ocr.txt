The President's Message.
Wl laid th tha meaeage, it full, before
oar raadera yesterday. Take A all in all, it
is tha weakest and tnoat inconsequential
Uoiminent that evei tnnatel from the
' chief mszietrnte of a Kreat nation. If we
had not betore been fully convinced of Mr.
Lincoln's utter Inability to successfully
. manage the affairs of the Government, we
could have no niingivings upon that tub
joct after reading hie late message. We
cannot help thinking how ssdly we have
dcirenerated in the firmness of cliaiaeter
and administrative ability of our rulers,
comparing pant with the preeeut Adininis
, tration. .
The message it iliieflv, and almost ex
. rrioeively devoted to tha negro question,
The " poor African " seems always tip
pe: piost, in AenAtiAM's mind. He argues
atlcugth in favor oi hie various ernenci
Jietion ecboiuea, but entirely fails to show
that it ti either posmble, practicable or con
etitutional.
He taye ' without slavery tha rebellion!
could never have existed;" endeavoring
thereby to Convey the idea that slavery it
the rant of the war. This we ttauy.

bellion could never have existed ; without
Abolitionism it could not continue." If
tha President will devote hiuiKelf to the
work of abolishing Abolitiunium, he would
soon end the war by removing the cause,
ava millions of money, thousands of men,
restore the Union, and hind it so thinly
that it would nrvei again be rent in frag
ments. '
Wa thiuk no more appropriate reply to
tha President's arguments for emancipa
tion can be adduced than his own language
used in his letter to the Chicago preochets,
who urged upon hira the necessity, and
' humanity " of a proclamation of eman
cipation. In reply to their importunities,
he said :
"What good would a proclamation of email
cipation irutn roe do, especially as we are huw
eituaied? 1 do not wish to issue a document
that ike whole world knowt must necessarily
be inoperative, like the lue' bull against

there to think it would have any grea

freedom and bi election to the slaves of rebel

could be iaduced, by a proclamation uf free

what ahoald w do with them How can we
feed and cart for such a multitude?'
" Bow can we feed aad care for such
multitude ? " , Well may . Miy Lixcoui
ask this question.' But now that he lias
issued a proclamation of emsncipatiop,
we desire that he answer th rpestiop
which he asked tha Chicago preacher.'

yet you denounce the former and lovingly

vilest and meanest kind of partisan ilcui
agognery we fail to understand tha situa

The subject of increasing tha price of
pewspspers continues to attact attention.
We have already mentioned that the Bos
ton newspapers have advanced their price
from too to Ihrei cents a copy, and the
New York Evening Pott has now increas
ed it subscription front 99 to 810 per an
um, with single copies at four cents.
The subject is also under consideration by
the Philadelphia publishers. . The New

this increase of prices i-

Newspapers. What Have We Gained by the Removal
of General McClellanâ€”
An Abolition View of It.
[From the Indianapolis Journal, the organ of Governor
Morton.]
The Situation of the Rappahannock.
I
We kwrdly know wkat to believe ol the si
sation of slfuirs on the Rappahaunock, but
what have wa mast reason to believe does uot,
ws confess, offer as a very plaasaat prospect.
The rebels seem to be massing all their avail
able force around Fredericksburg to resist our
advance on Richmond from that direction, and
it ia quite likely that they have aueceeded in
perfecting fortifications and collecting a force
saKicient to defeat any attempt of onr army
to cross the Happahauaock at that point A
river that has to be forded, and is yet frequent
ly too deep to be forded, does not arroru any
verv weal facilities for militarv movemenu
even when undefended, aad when iu banks

ered with well armed troops, it is decidedly ah
unpleasant obstacle. Against sucn an unsta
ble our army appears to have run its hesd,
aad halted, either stunned or pnzsled. "A
recoauoiesaace from which important results
are expected" is promised, but these "iinpor- j
tant reconnoiesances have too rarely led to
any thing bat the disgust of the troops Con
cerned 10 them, to give the puDiio any very
lively hope of seeing anything else come uf
this one. For the time the rebels have "head
ed" as, -and owr Generals-soem to sea no way
out of ths difficulty.
The change of base to Frederioksburg, like
McClellan's "change of base" to James river,
was heralded before it was accomplished as a
bit of "strategy" that would disconcert the
rebel arrangements completely and take us on
to Richmond speedily, itbas, so far aa ws
can now see, ended just as the other did, in
getting ns into a positioo where we can't ad
vanoa viihoat danger, nor retreat without dis
grace. If the rebels had complaisamly done
nothing while we were "changing our base,"
and had let us cross ths Happabauuock and
occupy Fredericksburg without Hindrance, we
have little doubt that we should now be in a
good deal better position to advance on Kiob
mond than we were on tbe Potomac. Uut the
rebela, most contumaciously and unexpected
ly, it seems, would not lie still along the west
ern base of ths Blue Kidge, and among its
gaps, while we were getting between them and
their capital. They started as soon as we,
snd, though they had a longer road to travel,
they heat us to the point. both were aiming at
In plain English, ihey have outgeneraled us.
We wish we could see some deep advantage
under the apparent defeat our plan some rea
son to hope that this blocking up of ths Rap
pahannock and massing ot the rebel forces
was expected and prepared for, that our get
ting into that exceedingly close corner was
only a feint to detain the rebels idle there
while we assailed them somewhere else, but
we ean't, Wa have seen no such profundity
of planning in our Uenerals yet as would
malts the failure of such a vast movement as
the march to Fredericksburg one of the ar
rangements for a final success. . Besidss, tbe
rumors that the army is to go into winter
quarters, which are begiuning to By tbiokly
arouud tbe well informed circles of . Washing
ton, show that no success oan be seen under
this failure by those whose connection with
tbe Government would give them at least the
hope, if not the knowledge, that the failure is
only a feint. This may be a discouraging
: view of the case, but we can see no good iu
concealing it Burnside has hardly bad a
fair chalice yet, but he seems to have done
very little with what he has had, except tode-
j prive himselt of all prospect of doing any
thing more. 11 it be true, as reported this
morning, tbst Stonewall Jackson ia to remain
in Northern Virginia, to employ our forces
along tbe Potomac, aud revive every month or
so those alarms for the safety of Washington,
which bare done the country more harm than
the destruction of Washington could do, we
don t see but that we shall ba held all this
winter in very much the same situatioa along
the Potomac that we were last, winter. We
don t feel happy in the prospect, we admit
A Miscalculation.
a
In December, 1861, Mr, Toombs, in a con
versation which is reported in the Atlantic
Monthly, said that wars rarsly brought into
the field more than a tenth of the adult male
population, and estimating the whole number
ot voterain the United states at tour millions,
be ooncluded that, in the event of a struggls
between the North and South, not more than
fonr hundred thousand soldiers would be call
ed out on both sidss. The loss of life, iu bat
tle and campdisease, be estimated at one tenth
of tha soldiers, Or torty thousand a mere bag
atelle snd especially, as be said, that those
Sen "must die enyAoie."
II Mr. Toombs was to make figures to-day,
ha would make very different ones. Four times
four hundred thousand soldiers are in the field.
At leaat twice forty thousand men perished in
battle or by disease in the single four months'
campaign on ths feninsula Nobody can set

The Brutalties of Fanaticism.

When the smoke of this conflict shall have
cleared away when results shall become an
alysed, and details be brought out prominent
ly thera will be exhibted a picture, or rather
pictures, which will make every maa net a
beast blusb to own tne name ot American.
Occasionally a tale of brutality and fearful
crime comes to our ears amid the lolls of the
fiercer storm tales which we hear incredulous
ly, unwilling io believe that the hearts of men,
having passions liks to as, claiming a oommoa
orgin, protessing a common laitn, ara so dam
nably cruel and wicked.
. The execution, nearly a month ago, of ten
Misaourians by order of Gen. McNeil, in pen
alty of the continued and itippoted forci
ble detention of a citizen of Palmyra, was one
of the saddest of all. Tea mea led deliber
ately forth, faaed by ten other men with
loaded musket, aid sent with hardly a Word
of warning into the presence of their. Maker.
Sevan of them being euly wouaded, were dis
patched by revolvers by men, great nearaasl
standing over tketn as tuey writhed in the ag
onies of their wounds, so close to them that
their breath must have obscured the polish of
tneir steel, anu witu aeuoerata sum snapping
tbe pistols in ikair fuces. What actswhat
glories as a nation to be hereafter won. shall
efface the picture of these seven men, fast
quitting the feeble hold of life, shoved over tbe
brink of eternity by the brutality ef their fel
lows.
