WASHINGTON.
Ken Butler Gives Pinchback a Chance
for the Senate.
Smith, cf Louisiana, Admitted
to the House.
DitrassioD in the Seiiete on Senator flor
rill's Financial Scheme.
Washington, Dec. 3, 1873.
Butier'a Move To Put Plnctobark lu the
Senate.
Much to the surprise of everybody in the House
to-day Butler moved to lay the resolution to ad
mit Pinchback on the table. Alter some opposition
from beck, who wanted to have a vote on It, the
resolut.on was laid on the table. The object of this
wove ol Butler's is undoubtedly to give PlnchbacK
time to get into the Senate, failing in which ho
will be admitted to the Qouse.
The action of the House in the case clearly indi
cates what may be expected from the great major
ity which the republicans have in the body. Cox
very indiscreetly made a party attack upon the
republicans, thus making it a party question, with
the result seen. Had he followed the course of
latmar and other democrats on the West Virginia
case, who never even once alluded to it as a party
question, it is the general opinion that the result
would have been similar.
The Back Pay Mill and Its Chances.
Home effort was made by several to get tho bill
reducing the pay of members referred, but the
House adjourned before taking any action thereon.
It is evident the republicans believe that the re
peal of the Increase of salaries will give their party
a clear bill of health to cover over the Moblller and
other irauds, and save the republican party. Mr.
Hale, of Maine?doubtless inspired by his mentor,
Hpeaker Blaine?is making himself particularly
?mclouB in the matter; but they will make very
little capital by it, as, from present Indications, the
democrats will vote as a unit for the Increase.
The Old Committee on Foreign Relations
To Be Continued?The Democrats, as
Usual, Oet Two Committees. .
The committee appointed by the republican Sen
ate caucus to-day to revise the standing commit
tees of that body have completed their duty.
Although the committee decline to furnish
Information to the press in advance of
their report to the caucus, it hns been as
certained from a member of the Committee on
Foreign Relations that tho committee will be the
same as at the organization of the Senate in March
last?namely, Cameron, Chairman; Norton, Hamlin,
Ilowe, Frelinghuysen, Conkhng and Scburz. Bout
well, wno entered the Senate after the organiza
tion of the committee in Murch, will go
on either the Committee of Commerce or
Finance. There will do probably 12
changes In ail. Vacancies are left in the
list to be filled at the suggestion of the democratic
Senators as heretofore, among which is the chair
manship of the Committee on Engrossed Bills, for
merly occupied by Mr. Casserly. The democrats
being allowed the chairmanships of two commit
tees?namely, the Private Laud Claims and En
grossed Bills?Senator Tliurmau is now chairman
ol tnc former committee.
Liberal Republicans Object To Being
Classed as Democrats.
The liberal republicans have signified their
wish that the republicans do not class them
as democrats, aud will accept such places as
may be assigned them on the committees
by the caucus. Senator Sumner will, it is said,
to-night be appointed ou a committee by the re
publicans, perhaps as a member of a contem
plated new committee.
The Contract tor the Five Per Cent
Loan Not To Br Renewed.
The contract with tho bankers composing the
syndicate for placing the Ave per cent loan expired
on Monday last and will not be renewed. The
Secretary of the Treasury will dctermtne in a lew
days the plan of future operations.
A Timely Reminder.
As the republican senators were assembling to
day in the ladies' reception room at the Capitol
lor the purpose of holding a caucus, senators Gor
don, of Georgia, and Ransom, of North Carolina,
both democrats, who were not aware of the use
the rooms had been for the time set apart for, at
tempted to enter. The doorkeeper politely in
formed them they could not go in. At tins Senator
Ransom got indignant and asked the em
ploye if he knew who he was, reminding
him at the same time that he was a Seuator and
had the right of access to the public rooms of the
Senate. The parley blocked the way of those en
titled to admission, and Senator Robertson, of
South Carolina, learning tho cause, said:?"Let in
the penitent sinners." The democratic Senators
withdrew their demand lor admission and found
more congenial atmosphere nearer the Senate
chamber.
Serenade to Horace Maynard.
Representative Horace Maynard, of Tennessee,
?was serenaded to-night Ht the Ebbltt House.
Among those in the room adjoining the balcony
from which he spoke were President Grant
and several members of the Cabinet and
h number of Senators and Representatives.
In the course of his remarks he said
that the people of Tennessee would see
lor themselvs whether the present agitation on the
subject of Cuban affairs boded war or peace.
They have read the protocol, which was honorable
to the United States and not dishonorable to Spain,
and will look to the President as a leader of peace
in this transaction, while they will not forget the
wisdom and caution of the Secretary of State
through whom the instrument was consummated.
Civil Service at Cincinnati and St. I.ouls.
Tlie President has designated Surveyor it. H.
Stevenson and Assistant Treasurer Wiiiiain E.
Davis to be associate members of rhe Civil Service
Hoard at Clncinnari, and Assistant A. 0. Edwards
and Deputy Surveyor H p. Wytnan to be associate

Lyman, of the Treasury Board, win act as substitute
for the Chief Examiner in the examinations soon
to be held in St. Louis and Cincinnati. The candi

number, are summoned to appear on the eth tnsu
Capture of Tltieves in the Indian Ter

Telegrams received here announce the capture 1
by Lieutenant Kerr, of tho Sixth cavalry, with 20
men of Company K, Sixth cavalry, of a number of
thieves, who have been depredating in Indian Ter
ritory for sonio months, running off|stock stolen
from Kansas into Texas and from Texas Into Kan
sas and Missouri. Lieutenant Kerr and his force
acted us a posse comltaius to assist a deputy mar
shal in serving warrants upon the gang, fbey
were eight in number, and were surrounded bv the
marshal and the troops near Oatdn Creek, Indian
Territory, having with them 7o horses and mules
and about aoo cattle. No shots were flred, as the
thieves made no resistance. They were taken Into
custody by the marshal, and will be tried tor grand
larceny by the civil eoorts. The troops protected
the raiders alter their capture, as scvcralTexaiis
who discovered their property in the hands of tho
gang were disposed to execute aummury ven
geance without waiting for legal trial.
Senator Morrill's Predilection for Stiver.
Heaator Morrill, who waa for years a country
trader at Strafford, Vt,, and whose financial edu
cation constated in buying butter cheap, to be paid
tor In caiico at high rates, is out against Inflation
and In favor of a return to lourpcncu-haltpennie*
and nlnepcnnics of silver. Good for Vermont,
perhaps, but not for the Union.
In Favor of Baron Bolleati's Pardon.
The nmnv friends here of Huron daaldree do
Hoilenn. who waa Secretary of tho French Lega

knew him believes thai he was aware of the
lraudulent nature of the acheme.
Opposition to InvelnnMrjr Baakraptcy.
There is to be a stormy effort made to secure the
repeal of the bankrupt law provision for involun
tary bankruptcy, as recommended by the Presi
dent, but it will be resisted by many Congressmen
whose political fliends have been lortnuate enough
to get positions under the law, where they are
umasslug large sums In the shape of fees.
Secretary Kiih'l Document* Edited This
Time.
The official despatchea of Secretary Fish, which
are to be published aa a portion of the documents
accompanying the Presidents Message, will not be
much If any over half as volnmlnous as were those
of last year. They have been carefully edited and
scrutinized by Assistant Secretary Davis, who bas
taken care that no paragranlts have crept In, as in
previous years, which have sadly disturbed
Peiuente oorUiale with friendly Powers.
The West Virginia Election,
The validity of the election held In Angnst and
October laBt in West Virginia came up In the
House on a motion to admit Davis, who claims to
have been elected In August, on the day of the
adoption of the new constitution. Though Davis
Is a democrat of the straightest kind he was op
posed by several of his party, while, on the othpr
hand, Uutler and other republicans supported his
claim to u seat. The desire of the democrats who
opposed his admission was to refer the legality of
the August election to a committee. Though It
seemed doubtful whether this would be accom
plished it was finally done, owing chiefly to the
very able speech of Lamar, of Alabama.
The LouInIun* Disputed Election*
The case of Smith and Davidson, of Louisiana,
next came up* Davidson was a democrat and his
case was championed by Cox and opposed by Bat
ter. This is perhaps one of the most extraordinary
cases that has ever come up in the House, and the
decision of the House In admitting Smith Is one of
tho grossest acts of usurpation that In all proba
bility has ever occurred In a legislative body, ex
ceeding, as a New York republican remarked In
private, the worst acts of "Boss" Tweed's Legis
lature In his palmiest days. It wus clearly showu
that the certificate of election was given to Smith
three days after the election, when there could by
no possibility be any returns received to Justify or
base his election on, the district tn which ho ran
being 800 miles long and there being no railroad or
telegraph by which they could be received in so
short a time.
8ttll Strengthening the Naval Force in
Cuban Waters.
The Navy Department is still busily engaged in
strengthening the forces at and about Key West
and Cuba, and providing for a heavy force in these
waters. Several of the most experienced engi
neers In the service have been In con
sultation with the Secretary with reler
ence to the workings of the Engineer Depart
ment. Nearly all the Important orders that
are considered necessary In a time of emergency
have been Issued; but there Is no Indication what
ever of a relaxation of the energy that has charac
terized the department since tho commencement
or the Spanish complications. Official reports from
the senior omcer at Key West represent the naval
force there as strong and effective.

LEGISLATORS ON THE MESSAGE.
Washington, Dec. 3, 1873.
The average sentiment ol members of Congress
on the President's Message, al ter conversing with
a number of Senators and Representatives, may
be summed up as lollows:?It meets but faint
praise as a State paper, and in many parts is
severely criticised. Opening with what is regarded
as a thinly disguised lament over the fall of
Jay Cooke and the financial allies of the
administration, a careful perusal discovers no
allusion whatever to the loss by death oi the Chief
Justice since the last meeting of Congress. A few
local and isolated victories for the Grangers in re
cent elections are expanded into an extinction or
party lines in politics, and the personal audience
granted by the Chinese Emperor to the foreign
Ministers at his court Is given undue prominence
in the Message. The motley crew sent
to Vienna are dnbbed as practical artisans
and scientists, against notorious tact3 to the
contrary. A brief and non-committal paragraph
announcing the application of President uaez lor a
protectorate over the Dominican Republic puts the
Samaria Bay speculation beiore Congress, where
the parties in interest are left to do what they can
In carrying through their scneme. So far as the
Message reveals a state or peace with all
the world but Mpalh it meets with ap
proval, and the President's abstention from
compromising allusion to afi'airs on our
Mexican frontier is received in the same
spirit, as is also the proposition to define und limit
the citizenship rights of Americans, who practi
cally sever themselves from the country and its
lute rests.
The suggestion that Congress shall be limited la
its special sessions to such matters as are brought
rorward by the Executive la not well received by
the uioinbers 01 that body, but a larger measure
oi acquiescence is given to the proposition that the
President shaH be armed with power to veto ob
jectionable parts of bills presented lor his ap
proval.
The discontinuance of extravagant appropria
tions lor newlloss public buildings, and of har
bor and river improvements not demanded by the
general interests of commerce, is admitted to be a
good recommendation; but, as part of the political
machinery of the dominant party, they arc not
llkeiy to be permanently eradicated from the legis
lation of Congress.
Ihe best praised feature of the whole document
is the round treatment of the slavery question in
Cuba; but regret is expressed by many that the
document becomes ssdlv muddled In attempting to
define and explain the relations o( the Casino Ka
paftnl to the supreme government at Madrid.
The financial topics oi the Message are the parts
that have isjen the most anxlousiy read and that
give the least satisfaction. The frank admission
that tlioy are "simply thrown oot" saves them
from the severer criticism tiufi wvuni have ivi
lowed if they had laid pretension to tne cnaraeter
or well digested propositions. But the point is
made against the Message that nothing of soch
grave consequence should be presented to Con
gress and to the country in such a form that does
not appear and claim to be the result of prolound
study and competent advice.
It is also charged against the Message that, In
straining after an elastic currency, it loses sight of
the evils of fluctuation altogether, and that a
whole train of fallacies loilow the mistaken view
that a circulating medium is wealth itself, and not
a mere representative of wealtn, with silver deposed
as a standard of value througnout the commercial
world, and gold as a leading product of American
industry on the Pacific slope. The Idea conveyed
tu the Message, that they should be prevented Irom
entering Into our exports and kept at home till
cheapened enough to admit of specie resumption,
is received by the business men In Congress as a
startling proposition in political ecououiy.
The Idea that the business of the country can be
taken in hand by Congress and its speculative
elements eliminated by legislation is similarly
ridiculed. v
Pre?iUng opinion seems to be that the effect
of the financial parts of the Messuge, so far as auy
efleot can he predicted, will bo to strengthen the
cause ol lree banking by exposuig the futility of
government Interierence, actual or proposed, with
the banking system of the country. An uninten
tional slap is given to the Freed men's Bank, with
Its numerous Southern branches, in the statement
that the volume of currency is virtually contracted
by the habit of the ireedtnon of hoarding or carry

EXTRACTS FROM THE DIPLOMATIC

Important Points In International Rela

Ministers to Foreign Powers.
Washington, Doc. 3, 1873.
The following extracts are made from the diplo
matic correspondence:
tn?f^ niIU8t?r 10 tne Argentine Republic reports
to the Department ol dtate certain difficulties and
obstructions which militate against an increase of
commeroe between the United States and the
nf iHra f countries. Not to speak of the want
2L.d,??t Bteam communication, he mentions,
first, the necessity that all irelght sent by steamer
Isew ^ork to the River Plato must be landed
at Kio, pay various custom House charges and pass
a tedious Custom Mouse process. Kven the houses
oi business that have responsible agents at Rio
have their goods delayed there from two to four
months, hlx mouths is not au unusual delay lor
packages ol valuable merchandise which have been
shipped by steamer in hope of a quick arrival. The
second obstruction is the neglect and refusal ol the
United States line of steamers from New Tork to
Kio to encourage the quick passage of freight and
malls to the River Plate. Ii the mails could arrive
regularly and promptly it would enable merchants
to place a groator confidence in their transactions
with their correspondents In the States, and conse
quently increase the amount of these transactions.
It small packages of merchandise, and especially
samples, could be sent by steamer without anv de
lay at ltio, it would cause a very large increase of
orders lor certain classes of goods, and create a
market lor many articles that are now practically
excluded from these countries.
It is understood, although our Minister cannot
speak with certainty, that the cost to Brazil alone
in the Paraguayan war was not less than
$000,000,000. The independence of Paraguay is
nominal rather than actual. The obligation Im
posed upon her people by the recognition of the

SENATOR liORlUI.I.'H FINANCIAL SCI1KMR.
At half-past twelve o'clock Mr. MoKaii.L, (rep.)
of VC, began to address the Benate on Ins resolu
tion offered on Monday. Instructing the Committee
on Finance to consider the expediency of reporting
a bill providing tor free hauklng and resumption of
specie nay merit on January l, 1874.
Mr. Morrill said It might not be the best tlmo
for discreet legislation during a panic, out in view
of our notes b?tug so nearly at par now, the ready
markets for all our products, Ac., he thought It
would be Inexcusable neglect on the part of oar
leinslalors not to tako advantage of all concurring
circumstances now to return to specie payments.
Xhe people should be relieved of the anxiety of
fluctiiatifins of paper ffiJrKnSyT' "What brdker
would have ventured at the close of oar war in
1806 to have predicted that nine long yt-grq would
elapse and not bring our currency to a specie

of the adnilnistration, oht n? w5utd endeavor to
stir up the ambition of all, and especially that or
the present congress to lift the country out of the
preseDt slough of depreciated currency. On tins
huandal subject tbo people expect Congress to
lead the way. It is the duty of the government to
Jirovido a sound currency, not oniy for itseli bat
or the people. Our commerce Is to be regulated
by Congress, but It can only be regulated through
toe instrumentality of a sound currency. Could
Congress shirk the duty of statesmen and in
definitely postpone the day ol our deliverance troru
depreciated paper currensy 7 He did not dare to
hope tuat he would be able to remove the objec
tions lingering in the minds of many, but wonld
try to show the evils arising from our present con
dition. Our experience does not differ trom that
or other couotries. It was easy enough to plunge
Into a paper currency, out the return was difficult.
Paper money (so-called) is not redeemable at the
will or the owuer, is not money. It bad been
claimed that our paper had not depreciated,
but gold had risen lu value. The same thing had
often been said before with us. It could not be
reasonably claimed that gold had risen Ui value,
when it is so notorious that its influx rrom the
Pacific coast and lroui Australia had decreased
its value. Borne had gone so lar as to
claim that the government might transfer tts
whole indebtedness into the semblance of money
bnt they lorgot the manly utterance of General
Grant's inaugural. Again the champions of a
paper currenoy appeared with their argument of
the confidence the people have In the government.
It la not a question of doubt of ability, but a ques
tion of the intention of the government to pay.
There was plenty or confidence in the ability of the
government to pay, but, unfortunutely, Congress
wonld not let it pay. The perperual flow ol gold
abroad had been a perpetual advertisement ol the
aepreciatlon of our currency. All ol oar bonds find
theiT highest appreciation in specie paying markets
abroad, and he most ask how long tins state ol
affairs must continue. Shonld no effort be madeto
care it, our depreciated currency would be handed
down from generation to generation as an Incurable
malady. Let the growing suspicion that no steps
are to tie taken towardB the resumption of specie
payments go on, ana we shall surely recede from
such payments, lie reierred to the banking rates
now being in excess of those of years ago. and
said the poorest money is always the dearest. The
expansion of paper currency shipwrecks many
undertakings which might have been successful
witn a sound currency. Alter referring to tho
banks locking up such sums as a part ot their re
serve, thus reducing the amount of money in the
hands of individuals, he spoke of the inconvenience
to which the mercantile community was con
stantly subjected by the large operators in Wall
street. He did not approve of the proposed Issue
ot government bonds interchangeable witn United
Stares notes, and thought the promoters or that
scheme sought an Indefinite expansion of the
currency. The seductive influences of an excessive
paper currency were terrible. Some seemed to
be willing to trust to time and nature to cure our
financial evils. With all due respect to time and
nature, he was unwilling to hand the matter over
to be cured. Congress must be equal to Its consti
tutional duty. Tbe people, who are deficient in
neither strength nor courage, long to say Ameri
can money is second to none in the world. They
long to handle once more the sound cash, and sec
the vain attempt to compete with paper against
the bard money of the world. What further degra
dations awaited us t No one could telL Where,
outside of our own country, does our money pass
at part Nature bad bestowed upon our land with
a lavish abundance the precious metal, but it
seemed as if we had failed In converting it into a
circulating medium. Our depreciated currency, or
money, not being genuine, or as good as it
onght to be, was held by the people without
being frugal, and was working ruin to the
morals of the nation. Labor, cheated In every
contract, was disgusted, and work seemed to be
going out of fashion. Lounging was the antocrat
of the times. How could we expect to train up a
conscientious people when the government itself
gave a bad example by the issue and reissue of
paper currency above its vainer With a return to
specie all obstacles to iree banking would be
removed, and the legitimate business of banking
would be restored tw all parts of the country:
but these reforms con id not be brought
about without the aid of Congress. He
was not wedded to any special plan,
but lavored that proposed by a prominent financier
of New York, that the Secretary of the Treasury
shall Issue certificates payable In four years, witn
Interest at 3.t)6, at par, in United States notes or
gold, at the option of the Holder, requiring the
banks to weep one moiety of their reserves in these
certificates, and lor the government to give notice
that on January 1, 1875, it will pay ita notes in cash
ia New York, anthorizlng the government to nego
tiate a loan of 200,000,000 in coin at six per cent
per annum. Tue certificates, as fast as re
deemed, may be paid out by tho Secretary of
tbe Treasury to satisfy claims against the
government. The return to specie payments
would, of course, be attended by some inconven
ience, but a reasonable time hud notice being
given the notes would gradually approach par.
All sound banks would be glad to return to a
specie basis. A lew mushroom institutions might
not be able to stand, but no one would regret rhcir
loss. He thought the republican purty had done
much towards advancing the national prosperity, !
and the work of specie payment was the only one
not yet attempted. "It would ixj an honor when
this nark cloud of greenbacks should be swept
away, and he hoped soou to submit a bill providing
lor the desired return to a specie basis.

LOUISIANA again.
"f* 0<>*. (dem.) of N. Y., offered ajresolution to
admit R. c. Davidson to a Heat an representative
from the Fourth Congressional district ot Louisi

stating that the contestant, Mr. Peters, hau died
since the election, and tn?t therefore Mr. David
son had the right to the seat, not only prtrrtd facie,
nut on the merits.
Mr< ftA'Jji JreP-) of Me., sought to raise the
question whether the House would now consider
the matter, stating that his object was to have the
Htates called lor bills, in order that He might press
a bill for tbe repeal or tbe Increase of Balary law,
but the Speaker decided that Mr. Hale was rather
late in raising the point, and so Mr. Cox
proceeded with a speech In support of his
rjBsqfutl&n. The onestiolLSt Issue Was whether the
flection (lelTOTl tfrefourtn Monday ot August, isttr.
at which Davis Ana Hogau received majorities, or
that held on tbe fourth Thursday of pctybeiy 187a,
at which Messrs. Wilson WA"
jorltlea. was the fepal one, thl uoT?rnorj certitl

the matter to the decision of tbe House. At the
close of the discussion Mr. (.arnar, of Mississippi,
making the last argument against the resolution,
the House refused to second the previous question,
and then, on motion of Mr. ttco/leld, of Pennsylva
nia, tbe resolution wan referred to the Committee

-? A NEW LOT7TSTAVA MEMBER.
Mr. Bptt.kb sent to the Clerk's desk and had

at a special election, held in tho Fourth district of
Louisiana on November 24, George L. Smith had
received a majority of tbe votes cast and was duly
elected to represent that district In Congress.
Mr. oox intimated that the certificate had been
got up in Washington, and staled that it was prac
tically impossible to have the vote counted so soon
In a district so large and without railroads. Ho
appealed to the House to give the Slate of Louisiana
the right to be beard through at least one Repre
sentative lairly elected.
Mr. Morky, (rep.j ot La., moved to amend the
resolution by inserting the name of George U
Smith, Instead of Davidson.
Mr. bptlbk stated that the Honse, by Its action
yesterday, had virtually decided the question, lie
cause If Peters had not died lie would have been
admitted with Sypher and Sheldon. A special
election had been held to All the vacancy, aud
George L. Smith had been elected and was entitled

Phelps, of New Jersey, voting in the negative, and
the oath of ofllce was administered to Mr. Smith.

AMUSEMENTS.
Opening of the Kew Fifth Avenue Thea
tre?The A (litres* of Or. Oliver Wendell
Holmei.
The new Fifth Avenue Theatre, In Twenty-eighth
street, near Broadway, was opened last night to a
brilliant audience. The house was the subject of a
thousand comments, universal admiration of its
beauty in every detail linding nt expression.
The uudtlorluui is, indeed, a gem. Perfect
In form and llnish, It is the realization of an
Ideal theatre. The double tiers of proscenium
boxes, richly decorated and adorned are the most
beautiful of any place of amusement lu the city,
and the French boxes In the rear give finish to the
paruuet. Overhead is a dome which is the perlec
tion of fresco painting. The sky Is as fine as any
that poet ever saw or painter endeavored to exe
cute. Amid such surroundings the first audience
gathered In the new theatre last night, lecling
that in these surroundings alone there wus
sufficient to satisfy them for any shortcomings
which might loilow. At the time announced tor
the beginning of the performance the theatre wad
full, a number of persons being accommodated
with scats on camp stools In the centre aisle. There
wus some delay in the beginning, but dually Miss
Fanny Morant appeared at the footlights and be
gan to recite the opening address, which was writ
ten b.v l>r. Oliver Wendell Homes, and was as
follows:?
Hang out our banners on the stately tower:
It dawns at last?the long-expected hour!
The steep is climbed, the srarllt summit won,
The builder's task, me artist's laoordone;
Beiore the finished work the herald stands,
And asks the verdict of your lips and hands.
Shall rosy daybreak make us all forget
The golden sun that yester evening set?
Fair was the labric doomed to pass away
Ere the last headaches born of Kew Ye;ir's Day.
Wit u blasting breath the fierce destroyer came
And wrapped the victim in his robes of flame ;
The pictured sky with redder n.oruing blushed.
With scorching streams the uatad's louutain
gushed,
With kindling mountains glowed the raneral pyre,
Forests aidaze and rivers ull on tire.
The scenes dissolved, the sbrlveillug curtain fell.
Art spread her wiugs and sighed along larewell I
Mourn o'er the plaver's melancholy plight?
Falstuffln tears, Othello deadly white
Poor Borneo reckomug what his doublet cost,
And Juiiet whimpering lor her dresses lost?
Their wardrobes burned, their salaries all un
drawn.
Their cues cut short, their occupation gone!
"Lie there in dust," the red-winged demon cried,
"Wreck of the lordly city's uope and pride!"
Silent they stand, and stare with vacant ga/e,
While o'er the embers leans the fitful blaze;
When, lu' a hund, before the startled traiu,
Writes 111 the ashes "It shall rise again?
Rise and confront Its elemental Iocs:"?
The word was spoken, and the wall arose.
And ere the seasons round their brlel career
The new-born temple waits the unborn year.
Ours was the toil 01 many a weary day
Your smiles, your plaudits only can repay;
We are the monarchs of the pointed scenes,
You, you aloue the real kings aud queens!
Lords of the little kingdom where we meet,
We lay our glided sceptres at your feet.
Place in your grasp our portHl's silvered keys
With one brief utterance?We have tried to please.
Tell us, ye sovereigns of the new domain,
Are you content?or have we tolled in vain?
With no irreverent glances look around
The realm you rule: for this Is haunted ground!
Here stalks the sorceier, here the latry trips,
Here limps the witch, with inallce-working lips;
The Graces here their snowy arms entwine,
ll.'rc dwell the fairest sisters of the Nine?
She who, with Jocund voice and t winkling e^e,
Laughs at the brood ol lolnes as they fly;
She of the dagger and the deadly bowl.
Whose charmiug horrors thrill the trembling soul.
She, who, a trtiaut Irom celestial spheres,
In mortal semblance now and then appears,
Stealing the lolrest earthly shape she cau?
Sontag or Nllsson, Lind or Miillbrau;
With these the spangled hour! of the dance?
Wuat snaft so dangerous as her melting glance,
As poised in air sue spurns the earth below,
And points aioi*. her heavenly-minded toe!
What were our life, with all its rents and seams,
Stripped of it* purple robes, oni waking dreams .
Tuc poet's song, the bright romancer's page.
The tinselled shows that cheat us on the stage,
Lead ull our fancies captive at ttieir?yvlll;
'Three years or threescore, we are children grill.

With Gotham's sag'-s hears the billows roll,
(Illustrious trio of the venturous bowl,
loo early shipwrecked, lor they died too aoon
To see their offspring launca the great balloou) ;
Tracks the dark brigand to his mnunrulu loir,
Slays the gnm gtant. suves the lady fair,
Fights all his country's battles o'er again
From Bunker's blazing height to Luudy'a Lane;
Float* with tne mighty cantnlus as they sailed
Before whose flag the flaming red cross paled,
And claims tne oft told story of the scars
.scarce vet grown wuite that saved the stripes and
Stars!
Children of later growth, we love the play,
We love its heroes, be they grave or gay.
From squeaking, peppery, devil-defying Punch
.To roaring Richard with his camel-hunch;
Adore It* heioines, those immortal names,
Tune's onlyirivals, whom he never tames.
Whose youth, unchanging, lives while thrones
decay;
(Age spares the Pyramids?and Dclazet);
The sauev-aproiieU, razoi-tongued soubrette,
The blond-haired beauty wttn the eyes oi jet,
The gorgeous beings whom the viewless wirea
Lin. to tne skies 111 stronttan-crinisoned fires,
And all the wealth ot splendor that awaits
Th* throng that enters those Elvsian gates.
See wnere the hurrying crowd impatient pours.
With noise of trampling leet and flapping doors,
Streams t?o tne numbered seat each pasteboard fits
And smooths Its candal plumage as It sits,
Walts while the slow musicians saunter in,
Till the bald leader taps lus violin,
Tfll the old overture we know so well,
Ziitnpa of Magic Flute of William Tell,
Has done its worst?then hark! the tinkling beni
The crash is over?the crinkling rtirtain tnriea,
And lo! the glories of that brigutcr woridi
Behold the offspring of the Thespian oart,
This lull grown tempie of the nisgic art,
Where an the conjurors of illusion meet,
Aud please us an me more, the more they cheat.
Those are the wizards and the witches too
Who win their honest bruad by cheating you
With cheeks Uiat Urowu tu artificial tears
And lymtf stall-caps whfte with seventy year*,
Sweet-tempered matrons changed to scolding
Kates, *
Maids mild as moon beams crazed with murderous
hares.
Kind, simple souls that stab and slash and slay
And stick at nothing, ir it's in the play l
Would all the world told half as harmless Ileal
Would all its real fools were half as wise
As he who blinks through dull Dundreary's eyes!
Would all the unhanged bandits oi the age
Were like the peaceful ruffians of the stage I
Would all the cankers wasting town and state,
The mob of rascals, little thieves and great,
Healers rn watered milk and watered stocks,
Who lead us lambs to pasture ou the rocks?
Shepherds?Jack ftheppards?of their city flocks?
The rings of rogues that rob the luckless town,
Those evil angels creeping up and down
The Jacob'B ladder of the treasury stairs?
Sot stage, but real Turplns and Macaires?
Could dofr, like us, their knavery with their clothes
And tlnd it easy as lorgettlug oaths l
- WelcSHta, thrice welcome to onr virgin dome,
The Muses' shrine, the Drama's new-found hornet
Here shall the statesman rest his weary brain,
The worn-out Artist And his wits again;
Here Trade torget his ledger and his cares,
And sweet communion mingle Hulls and Hears;
Here shall the youtliiul lover, nestling near
The shrinking maiden, her he holds most dear,
flaze on the mtnilc moonlight as It falls
On painted grove*, ou .sliding canvas walls,
And sigh, "My angel! What a hie or bliss
We two could live In such a world as this!"
Here shall the tumid pedants ot the schools,
The gilded boors, the labor scorning tools,
The grass-green rustic and the smoke-dried cit
Peel each in turn the stinging lash or wit,
And as it tingles on some tender part
Kach find a balsajp in Ins neighbor* smart,?
So every folly prove a freBh delight
As iu the pictures of our play to-night.
Farewell! The players wait the promoter's call;
l'neuds, lovers, listeners! Welcome one and ah \
Only a part of the address was allotted to Mis s
Morant, and as she ceased the curtain rose, reveal
ing the entire Fifth Avenue Theatre company. Mr.
Frank Uardenburgh then took np the ad
dress and finished It. The company of the
theatre ranged on the ample stage presented
a brilliant picture. The recitations were well
dono both by Miss Morant and Mr. Hardenburgb,
the former especially delivering the lines of the
poet with decided effect. The enactment of the
piece which followed was not In keeping with the
excellent promise of the opening address and the
revelation which was made upon the lilt
ing of the curtain during its delivery. UrJ
Albery's play of "Fortune" la a decided*
failure, It Is without characters, without!,
situations and without art. What it is all about)
nobody was able to discover. Evidently the play1
reads much better thau it acts, or it would never)
have been produced at this theatre. The only
things about It which are to be commended are;
occasional nasties of wit aud a few passages o0
sprightly dialogue. Otherwise it is dull, dreary antV
nonsensical, aud Mr. Albery Is to be congratulated.!
upon writing ono ot tne worst plays ever produced!
on the American stage. Mr. Daly may cut dowuJ
the piece aud In part rewrite it so as to make fr
good acting play out of It. but as it was last night:
It was a pitiful sight to sec good actors flounder
ing through parts so puerile that the strongest en
deavors could make nothing out of them. If we had
never seen Fisher, Clarke, Uarktna and James
and Miss Davenport, Mrs. Gilbert and Miss Jewett. ?
In other parts we could scarcely have avoided
pronouncing them bad actors in a bad play^
Mr. Lewis, whose name is in the cast, Is sick, and.
his place was taken last night by Mr. Owen Fawcett.,
The scenery was magnificent, and the furniture*
used In the first act. especially the carved chairs,,
was among the finest ever used In a theatrical per-,
formauce. Every thing, was done In excellent style;*
even the programmes prepared nnder the direc
tum of Mr. J. w. Morrisscy, the treasurer, were of
satin. The performance did uot close till long after
midnight.
Italian Opera? Al?la.
The third performance of this work drew one of
the largest houses of the season, and was such a
marked Improvement over the previous represen
tations that little was left to be desired. The
music also improves on acquaintance, and at each'
hearing new beauties are revealed. Verdi has*
completely discarded mere prettlness of melody
in It, and exhibits a dramatic grandeur
of design unsurpassed by any modern operatio
composer. The remiulscencea which are thickly
scattered through ttie opera, and which wo
pointed out at the first representation, are not
plagiarisms by any means, for the treatment, in
strumental and otherwise, is original in every,
sense of the word. Reminiscences in an opera
are not at all derogatory to a composer's reputa
tion when they are used with the consummate
l skill that Blgnor Verdi exhibits. Portrait aud
' landscape painting In the most vivid musical colors,
j from the barbaric splendor of "L'Africaine" to
the septentrional gloom of "Robert," distinguishes
tuis truly great work. The voluptuous school of
Italy loses none of Its charms when wedded to the
: asceticism of Germauy. Verdi's later years reflect'
more lustre on his genius than all his efforts when
melody was spontaneous with him. The work
, is encrusted with rich gems, not of that
superficial kind that are transferred to bar
? ret organs, nut more valuable to a mu
sician. The third act, with its magnificent
portraiture of love and passion, is, musically speak
j nig, the best of the opera. When the curtain lell
I last night on the betrayal of Radames Mile. Torri
; am and Messrs. Campmum and Maurel were re
? peatedly called before t lie curtain. It was a re
I ncwal of the success oi the duet iu the fourth act
I of "I^es Huguenots." Miss Clary achieved such a
j triumph iu the rOle ot Amneus last night that made
it a fit companion picture for Mile. Torriom's Alda.
signer Nauuetti made the rfite of Ramfis, the Hlgli
Priest, a mature in the opera. Chorus and orchestra
i were absolutely faultless, and with the magnificent..
m/as en soitte called lorth the frequent and hearty
' applause oi the audience. "Alda" will be given lor
I the last time on Friday.
Wood'* Muicum-Mr. Owens and III*
Company.
I ? Mr. John E. Owens cannot be said to be known
o.v the company tic keeps. He is good and tt la
bad, bat the evil associations do not appear to
have corrupted the goodness of Ills artistic man
ners. Perhaps the reason is that the tronpc ac
i companies him in his travels, but Is not an acconi
. paimucnt to him in anything else. Last evening
he appeared at Wood's Museum as Major De Hoots
and .Solon Shingle. , In the last mentioned charac
! ter he is exceedingly well known here; in the
; former not so well. His Solon Shingle is a realistic
| portraiture of a Yankee farmer full of unconscious
; qualntnesses and laughable idiosyncrasies. It Is
as rough aud crooked as an overgrown
J potato knotted with excrescences, and has;
a not unpleasant flavor of the fields.
It it a genuine bit of human nature,
, as human nature appears when subjected to cer-i
tain bizarre conditions which may lie discovered t
by any one who chooses to peer patiently enough,
! among the obscure farm lauds of New England. If j
it is tinctured with caricature, the caricature is to'
j the substratum of the character what a blossom
! artificially enlarged is to the original trult. In this,
1 impersonation Mr. Owens has so long been acknowl-i
edged to be perfection, and has been seen so re-.
; peatedly in tuls city, that it is next to Impossible^

cesspit. It is ungracious and unwise to habitually^
make comparisons, and we hope we shall not
tie accused of doing so when we say that}
the very lorclble Impersonation given by Mr. John,
S. Clarke to this character renders tt almost lm
. possible for any other artist to achieve great suc^
cuss In it. The material of the rOle presents vast
temptations to burlesque; but, since "Everybody's}
i Friend" pretends to be a comedy, and, thereiorr,
a representation ot social foible's, the yielding to.
such temptation is fatal to the spirit of the play.,

Olympic Theatre?"The Marble Hear***
' Last evening "The Marble Heart" was brought
out at the Olympic Theatre, with Mr. Edwin Adams
as Phidias and Raphael. It la one of those won
derful French plays which are full of brilliancy^
and bathos. It Is almost too late In the day to re
mark that much of the dialogue ta witty and micti
of tbe moral maud 110. It la as full of points as ?
paper of pins and as lull of shock as a chevanx-de
irise, ami in it tne voice of morbid passion Is heard
with dliterent degrees oi loudness, from the sickly
sweetness of the music box to the dignified thun
der ol the orchestrion. Mr. Adams has frequently
acted the part, uud uses in it his fine voice to
pleasing snd passionate effect. The part of Marie
was played by Mrs. ('. W. WaKot, whose ingenu,
ousness was somewhat too mature and whose sim
plicity wa* a trifle too htboied. As a whole tbq
play was fairly i erlormed. It will be repeated'
throughout the week.
