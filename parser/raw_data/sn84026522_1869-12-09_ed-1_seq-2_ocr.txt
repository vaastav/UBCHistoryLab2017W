The proceedings of the Legislature
for tile past week are of a most ridicu
lous and foolish character.
The whole time has been consumed
in fruitless attempts at investigation of
frauds, aud the movers are no nearer
the accomplishment of their purpose
than when they first began.
No one doubts the existence of ex
tensive frauds, but the honest men of
the Legislature had best turn their at
tention to the other interests of the
people, and let the perpetrators alone
for tlie present. Backed by the domin
ant radical party they laugh to icorn
any and all atteuips at investigation.
Let other important business be at

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
To the Setiate and House of Ii,yre$cntaU'ves:
In coming before you for the first time as
Chiet Magistrate of this great, nation, it is
with gratitude to the Giver of all j;ood for
the many benefits we enjoy.
OCR COUNTRY.
We are blessed with peace at home with
out any entangling alliance abroad to for
bode trouble, with a territory unsurpassed in
fertility, of an area equal t an abundant
support of live hundred millions of people,
abounding iu evei y variety of useful mine
ral, in quantity sufficient to supply the world
lor manufacture, exuberant crops, and a va
riety of climate adapted to the production
of every species of earth's riches, nutted to
the habits, tastes and requirements of every
living thing. A population of foriy millions
of free people speaking one language, facili
ties for every mortal to acquire an educa
tion with institutions closed to none, the
avenues to fame or auy blessing of fortune
that may be coveted, freedom of the pre.-
aud school, and a revenue flowing into the
national treasury beyond the requirements
of the government.
Happily, haimoiiy is being rapidly restor
ed v.uLiu our borders. Manufactures hith
erto unknown in our country are springina
up in all sections, producing adogree of i.a
tionai independence unequalled by any oili
er power. These blessings, and countless
othcts are entrusted to yourcaro and mine
for sat? keepiite, for the brief period of our
tenure of office. Li a short time e must
each of us return to iheiv.iiks of the people
" ho have coniei red our honor., and account
t t'.iem for our stewardship. 1 earnestly
ueire ins.1 niLiier you nor 1 may i:e con

A natio;sa! debt had been contracted ;

The work of restoi ing ike titaie jjovein
tnents loyal to the Union, of protecting anil
fostering free labor, of providing the
mean 1 r the j aym?t t of the i::

pl attention inuu Congress.
A'thoagh your eti'-ru have not ra?t with
jsuccess in all pa; ticulars that m;uh. have
i been desired, yet en the whtile they have
been mure successful than could have been
reasonably anticipated.' Seven St
ICS whicti
j.'as-ed ordinatices of secession, have been
fully restored ti) places in the Union. The
eichth. (Georgia.) lie! I an election at which
she ratified her constitution, republican in
form, and elected a Governor, members of
Congress, a State Legislature and other offi
cers required. The Governor was installed,
the Legislature met and performed all the
acts then requite ! of them, by the recon
struction acts of Congress; subsequently,
however, iu violation of the Constitution
which they had just rat: tied, as since decid
ed by the Supreme Court f the State, they

The freedmen, under the protection which
they have received, are making rapid pro
gress in learni ist, and r.o complaints are
heard of a lack of industry on their ja;t
when they receive fair remuneration for
i their labor.
The measures providing for psvinrj tiie iu-
j (erBl on lhe pub:jc de,,t wk,J al, ol,,er ex.
! pei.ses. of the government, are more than
ample.
Tlr? lo s of our comlneiee is only the re
suit or tne tate leneii.oii. wtiteti lias not re-
ceiveil snllifiei.t attention Irom you. To
this subject 1 call your earnest attention,
but will not tiow Migoest plans by which
this object may be ellected, but will, it
necessary, make it the subject of a special
message during the se-sion of Congress.
At lLn. March term of Congres-, by joint
resolution, it authorized the Executive to
order elections in tlio Suites of Virginia,
Mississippi and Texas to submit to them
the Constitutions which each ha i previously
framed, and U submit th.i Constitutions,
either entire or in separate parts, to be voted
upon -ti. lhe direction of the Executive. Un
der this author.ty elections were called, in
Virginia the election took dace on tho Gth
of J u'y. A Governor and Lt. Governor were
elected, and have been ir.sfilled. The Leg
islature met and did all required by this
resolution, ami by all the recou: truction
acts of Congress, abstaining from ail
doubtful legislation. I recommend thai her
Senators and Ilepierentatives b promptly
admitted their seals, ai dtf at State be
fully iestored to its place in the family of
States.
Elections were called in Mississippi and
Texas to commence on Jthe .'JOth of Novem
ber two days iu Mississippi, and four days
in Texas.
The elections have taken place, but the
result is not yet known, lt is hoped that
the acts of the Legislatures of these States
w hen they meet will be such as to receive
your approval and thus close the work of
i econsuuetion.
FINANCES.
Among the evils growing out of the re
bellion ami not yet lefened to, is that of an
irtedeeuiable cuiiency. It is an evil which
I hope Will leceive your most earnest at-
i "lakes the nuiti of bu.siness an involuntaiy
gambler, for in all sales where future pay
meiil is to be made, both parlies must know
i as to what will be the value of the currency
I lO bP tiahl Iflil TYI-ivl i Cnrliutllv .. ...
! unnd to you, then, such legislation as will
lie ceitaiu to insure a gra lual return to spe-
1 lp payments, am: put and immediate slop
! to the llncumtion in the value of currency.
i The methods to secure the former of these
J I riK 1 1 If M niA a . . 1 .
results aie as Tiumerous as sneculars on no-
e . i 1
oiicHi economy io secure the latter. I fee
' but one way. That is to authorize the treas
i " ,y n'd,'e,n itH ow" Wer at r. fixed price,
wU-Uier presented or withheld from circu
lation all cuirencv so redeemed until sold
aain for gold. The vast resources of the
nation, loth developed aud undeveloied,
ought to make our credit the best on the
earth. With less burden of taxation than the
citizen has eudured for six years past, the
entire public debt could bo paid in ten
years, but it is not desirable that the people
should be Used to pay it in that time.
Year by year lhe ability to pay increases in
rapid ratio, but tho burden of interest ought
to be reduced as rapidly as can be without
the violation of contract. The public debt
is represented in a great part by bonds hav
ing from five to twenty and from ten to
forty years to run, bearing interest at the
rate of s.x and five per cent, respectively.
Ii is optional with the governmen.!, to pay
these bonds at any period after the expira
(lou of the least lime mentioned upon their
laces. The time has already expired wlieu
a great part may bo taken up, and rapidly
approaching when all may be believing
mat all which are now due may be replaced
in bonds bearing at a rale of interest not
exceeding 44 per cent., and rapidly as the
remainder becomes due, that they may be
replaced in lhe same way. To accomplish
this it may be necessary to authorize the
interest to be paid at either of three or four
of the money centres of Europe, or by aud
Assistant Treasurers of the United States,
at the option of the holder of the bonds. 1
suggest ltd subject for the consideration of
Congress, and also, simultaneously with this,
the propriety of redeeming our currency,
before suggested, at its market value, at the
time the iavr goes into effect, increasing the
rate at which the currency v.id be bought
and sold, from day to day, or week io week,
at the same rale of interest as the Govern
ment pays upou its bonds, subject to tat iff
and internal revenue taxation, will ueeesjit
rily receive your ationiiou.
The revenues of the country are griater
than the requirements, aud may with safety
be reduced: but thj Pandtng- of our debt on
a four or four ami a half per cent, loan would
reduce the annual current expeuses la gely,
and thus atter funding justity a greater rd
duetiou ot taxation lliau would be expedi
ent now. , I suggest the postponement of
this question until the next meeting ot Con
gress. Ii may be advisable to modify taxation
and '.arid iu instance where unjust or bur
densome discrimin:iii,ns are made by lhe
present laws, bat a general revision vf the
laws regulatiuji this I recommend to be post
ptiued tor tne present. 1 aiso suggest a ie
newai of tho tax on incomes, but. at a in
duced rate say three or four perceut., anl
tuts tax to exo.re in three yeais.
With the funding ot the national debt aj
heiv s tggesie i I feel safe in saying that
taxes and teveutve trom imporLiis may be
reduce-1 safeiy from sixty to eighty ndiiious
per auui.ni ai once and may be fun e;
i educed from year to year as the rtaou: ojs

the riithis of biiiigeiem-y. either to a people

Tne United Stales has no d sp satiou to in
terfere with the enisling leiai.ons of 8,.ain
t her colonial possessions ou this continent.
They lud.eve that in due time Spain, and
other Ilu.opeau powers wiii itnd their inter

tablishing tin ir p e..er;t dep -i d 'i.c es as in
dependent powers. These dependence-, are

the presetit relation of colonies ceases ;h-v
are to become independent powers, exef
cising the right ot choice and of self con
trol in the ele eimlnaiiou of tii-ir future con
ilition and relation with other powers. The
United States in order to put a .slop to the
bloodshed in Cuba, ntid iu the imerest of a
neiohbo:ino people, proposed its good olli
ces to bring the existing contest to a termi
nation. Tiie offer not beino accepted by
Spidn on tho basis which we believed cottid
he receive! by Cnbp, wai withelrawn. Ii is
hoped that tne good (hees of the United
State's may yet prove advantageous for the
FOltlement d this unhappy sirife. Iu the
meantime a number of illegal expeditions
Bitainst Cuba have been broken up. It hs
been the endeavor of the Administration lo
execute the neutrality laws, no matter how
unpleasant the task, made so by the sitiler
iugs we have endured from lhe lack of like
good faith towards us by other nations.
On the 20lh of Mrrch last the U. S. schoo
ner " Lizzie Major" was arrested ou the
hioh seas by a Spanish frigate. Two pas
sengers were taken and carried psisoneis to
Cuba. Iloptesentations of these facts were
made to the Spanish government as soon as
oflicial information reached Washington.
The two passengers were s"t at liberty and
the Spanish government assured the United
States that tho Captain of the frigate in
making the capture had acted without law;
that ho had been reprimanded, and that the
Spanish authorities iu Cuba would not sanc
tion any ni:t that could violate rights, or
treat wilh disrepeot tjio -.oven ignty of this,
nation, 'j'be question of the seizure of th
biig " Mary Lowell V at Bahama by th
Spanish authorities is now the subject of cor
respondence between this government nd
Spain aud Great Britain. The Captain Gene
ral of Cuba about May last issued ajwocla
matiou authorizing the search of vessels on
the high seas. Immediate remonstrance was
made against this, whereupon the Captain
General issued a new proclamation ' limiting
search to vessels of the United States au
thorized under the treaty of 175.. This
proclamation, however, was immediately
withdrawn f;
I have always felt that the most intimate
relations should be cultivated between the
United States and the independent nations
ou this continent, lt may be well worth
considering whether new treaties between
us and them may not be profitably entered
into to secure more intimate relations,
Irieadly commercial aud otherwise intero
ceanic connection between the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans through the Isthmus:, of Da
rien, is one in which commerce is greatly" in
terested. Instructions have been given our
minister to the several States of Columbia
to endeavor to obtain authority for a survey
to determine ne practicability of the un
dertaking. ::'
In order to comply wilh an agreement of
the Uuiteel Stales as to a mixed commission
at Lima for adjustment of the claims, it he

The ood ofiiods of the United States lo
bring about peace between Spain and the
South American republics having been ac
cepted by Spain, Peru and Chili, a congress
has been invited lo be held in Washington
during the present winter. A grant has
been given lo Europeans of au exclusive
right of transit over tho territory of Nicara-J
gua to which Costa Rica has given its assent,
wh ch it is ailrgeel conflicts with the vested
rights ot the cuizeTs of the United States.
The .Department of State has now this suAV
ject under consideration. The Minister of

and that Spain was constructing in ami near
New York thirty gunboats, which aright be

secure one their concession excludes capi

competing upon the shores of Fiance.
1 recommend legislation to piolectthe
rights of citizens under the Stales aud sov

ple f monopolies in the Ocean trade cables.
Tiie unsettled political condition of other
ciMintries, less fortunate than our own,
sometimes induces their citizens to come to
the United Stales for the sole purpose of
becoming naturalized, and having secured
this, they return to thir native country aud
reside there without diseasing their change
of allegibace, they accept official positions
of trust ami honor, which can only be held j
by citizens of their native lauds. They I
journey under a passport describing them
as such citizens, and it is only when civil
discord after perhaps years of quiet threat- i
ens their positions or their property or when
their native Stale drives them into its mili
tary service, where their oaih of allegiance
is made known. They reside permanently
away from lhe United States, they contrib
ute nothing to its revenues, avoid the duties
of citizenship aud only make themselves
known by a claim of protection. I have
directed the diplomatic aud consular officers
to scrutinize carelully all such claims of
protection as citizens of the United States
whether native or adopted, who discharges
his duty to his country is entitled to it com
plete protection. W bile 1 have a voice in
the direction of affairs 1 shall not consent
to degtade this sacred trust by conferring it
upon fictitious or fraudulent claimants.

Your attention is respectfully called to
the law regarding the tariff ou Russian hemp,
aud to the question whether to fix the char
ges on Russian hemp higher than they are
on Vanilla is not a violation of our treaty
with Russia. Piaci jg her products on the
same footing with those of the most lavora
ble footing, our manufactures are increasing
with wondertnl rapidity under the oncour
Bgomeut which they now leceive, with the
improvement in machinery already elfected
and still increasing, causing machinery to
take the place of skilled labor to a large ex
tent. Our impotts of many articles must
tail largely within a Tow years; fortunately,
too, manufactures are not coutiued to a few
localities as formerly, are more diffused
making the interest iu them equal in all
sections. They give employment and sup
port to hundreds of thousands of people at
home and retain with us the means which
otherwise Would be shipped abroad. The
extension of the lailroads iu Europe aud the
East is bringing into compel itioti with our
agricultural produce like products of other
countries ; self-interest if not self-preservation
therefote d.ctales caution agamsi dis
turbing any industrial interest of the coun
try. It leads us also to tho necessity uf
looking to other markets for the sale of out
surplus. Our neighbors south of us and
China ami Japan should receive our special
attention. It will be the purpo.-e of the ad
minii'tration to cultivate such relations villi
all these nations as to enkindle us their con
fide,, ce and make it lo their interest as well
as oars to establish better commercial rela
tions througli lhe agem.-y of a more enlight
ened policy than that heretofore pursued t -wa.dsChii.a
Largely due to the sigactty
ai.d etlorts of one cf our ow u distinguished
citizen the wo;id is about, to commence
largely increased relations with that popu
lace and hitherto exclusive nation. As the
United States have been the originator iu
thii new policy, so they should be the most
earnest in showing their good faith iu mak
ing it a success in this connection. I advise
such legislation as will forever preclude the
etisiavemer.t of the Chinese upon our soi!
under the name of coolies anel also prevent
American vessels from engaging in trans
porting coolies to any country to locate the
system. I alo recommeud that a mission
to China be raiseel to one of the first class.
In my assuming the responsible duties of
Chief M.igiiatrale of the United States it
was with the impression that three things
were essential lo iis peace, prosperity anel
fullest development,
1st. Among these a strict integ'ity, in
fu! filling ali cur obligations.
il'id. To secure 'protection to the person
ami property of the citizens of the Uuited
States. I i each and every portion of our
common country he may choose to move

3rd. Union of all f our States w ith equal
rights, indestructible by any constitutional
means. To secure the titst of these, Con
gresshas taken two essential steps first in
eieclarmg, by joint resolution, that the pub

means for paying, and providing the means,
however, cottid n it secure the object de
sired vithout f. proper administration of the
laws fir the collection cf the revenue and r.n
ecououical d isbur.se men t of them. To this
object the administration has tuof-t effective
ly ad- ressed itself wKh tho results, 1 hova
satirfcclory to the country. There h".s been
no hetitatioti in changing officials in order
to secure an effective execution of the laws,
sometimes, too where in a mere party viDw.
uneli cribed political resuCts tvera liHely to
follov, nor any position in .'ustaiitlng efli
cientolliciais rgaiast remonstrances wholly
political.
lt uay be well to mention where the ei::
baiva.ment is possible to arise from leaving
on tie statute books to-called tenure of
office acts, and to earnestly recommend their
total lepeal. It could not have been the in
tention of the framcrs of the Constitution,
when providing that an appointment made
by tin President should receive the consent
of the Senate, that the latter should have
power' to retain in office, persons by feeleial
appojulmeuts against the will of the Presi
Ueut the law, and inconsistent with the
faithful and eflicient administration of the
Govfttinient.
W iat faith can an Executive put in offi
cials forced upon him, and those, too, whom
he las suspended for treason 1 How will
such officials be likely to serve an adminis
tration which they know does not trmt
tliert.
For the second it is requisite to our
growth and prosperity and a lirin but hu
mane administration of the existing law?,
amended from time to time as they may be
defective or prove harsh and unnecessary, at e,
probably, ali that are required. The thirel
cannot be allowed by special legislation, but
must be regarded as fixed by the Constitu
tion itself, and gradually acepaiesced iu by
the force of public opinion.
From the foundation of the government to
the present the management of the original
inhabitants of this continent the Indians
has been a subject of embarrassment and
expense, and hzn been attended with con
tinuous r?bellion3, murders and wars. From
my own experience on the frontiers and In
dian countries, I do not tiold either legisla
tion or the conduct of th3 w hites, where they
come in contact wilh the Indians, blameless
for these hostilities. The past, however
cannot be undone, and the question must be
met as we now find it. 1 have attempted a
ne.r policy towards these wards of the na
tion they cannot be regarded in any other
l.gut than as wards with fair results so far
as tried, and which I hope will be attended,
ultimately, with great success. The Society
of Friends is well known as having sueceed
eel in living in peace w ith the Indians in the
early settlement of Pennsylvania. While
there, white negotiations of other sects in
oilier sections were constantly embroiled,
they are also known for their opposition to
all sirife, violence and war, and are general
ly noted for their strict integrity anel fair
dealing. These considerations induce me to
give the management of a few reservations
of Indians to them and to throw the burden
of selection of agents upon the Society itself.
The result has proved most satisfactory. It
will be fouml more fully set forth in the re
port of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs ;
for superintendents and Indian agents not in
tiie teservation ollices of lhe army, were se
lected. The reasons for this aie numerous
where Indian agents are sent there, or near
there, troops must be sent also. The agents
ami the commamier of troops are indepen
dent of each other and subjecj to orders
from tlte different departments of the gov
ernment. The army officer holds a position
for life ; the agent one at the wiil of the
President The former is personally inter
ested ,in living in harmony with the Indian
and in establishing a permanent peace to
the end that some portion of his life may be
spent within the limits of civilized society
The latter has no such personal interest.
Another reason is, au economical one, and
still another, the hold which the government
has upon a l fe officer to secure a fnithfa
discharge of duties in carrying out a given
policy.
The building of railroads, and the access
thereby given to all the agricultural and
mineral regions of the country is rapidly
bringing civilized settlements into contact
with all the tribes of Indians. No matter
what ought to be the relations between such
settlements and the aborigines, the fact is
they do not harmonise well, and one or the
other has to give way in the end. A system
which looks to the extermination of a race
is loo horrible for a nation to adopt without
entailing upon itself the wrath of alf Chris
tianity, and the endorsing the citizens dis
regard for human life aud the rights of oth
ers dangerous to society. I see no substi
tute for such a system, except in pi cing all
the Indians on large reservations as rapidly
as t can be done, and giving them absolute
protection there. As soon as they are fitted
for it they shoul be induced to take their
lands in severalty, and to set up loyal ports
for their own moieetiou. For full details
on this subject I call your special attention
to the reports of the Secretary of the In
terior aud the Commissioner of Indian Af
fairs. The recommendation of the General of
the Army that appropriationa be made lor
the forts at Partland, New York, Philadel
phia, iNew Orleans and San Francisco if for
no other consideration is concurred in.
I call special attention to the recommen
dations of the Chief of Ordnance regarding
the sales of arsenalo and laud? no longer oi
use to the Government. Also to the recom
mendation of the Secretai y of War that the
act prohibiting promotion in the staff corps
of tlie army be repealed. The extent of
country to be garrisoned and the number of
military posts to be occupied is the same
with a reducetl army as with a large one,
and lhe number of staff officers required is
more deeudeiit upon the latter than the for
mer condition.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy,
accompanying this, shows the condition of
the navy when this Administration came
into office, and the chauges made since, by
strenuous effort, have been made to dace
as many vessels "in commission," or render
theui tii for service, if required, as fast as
possible, and to substitute tiie sail for steam
while crusiug, thus materially reducing the
expenses ot lhe navy, and adding greatly
to iis effectiveness. Looking to our luture
course I recommeud a liberal though not
exlravagaut policy towards this branch of
the public service.
The repor of the Postmaster General fur
uishes a clear anel comprenensive exhibit of
lhe operations of the- postal service, and ol
the financial condition of the Post Ollice
Department.
The ordinary postal revenues for the year
ending the o'JUi of June, lbO'J, amounted to
