President Taft submitted a message
to congress at the opening of thai legis

exclusively with the trusts. It is a
clear statement of fact and defines the
r administration policies on the subject,

nal endorsement of the supremo court's
deckles in the Standard Oil and To
tfacco trust cases. The present trust
law is good enough, says the president,
all that Is needed is to enforce it, and
ha seems to be willing to undertake the
jab of enforcing It.

ilatlon, 1M1.
Henry Martla and Fr4 Bradford
wore churns at school, chums at college
ami chuBM wheji they were aakldle
aged. Henry Martin waa a trifle the
older. lie had married very younjr,
but had lost hie wife, who left hla
with a little daughter. That daughter
was now seventeen years old.
"Fred," said Martla one day, "I'm
going away on a buslaees trip. Millie
will be under the care of the house
keeper during ny absence, but she
needs a certain attention that the old
woman can't give her. The truth Is, I
am afraid of a youngster about Millie's
age. Since 1 doa't waat my girl te
be mixed up In aay puppy lore affair,
I would like you to take her under your
care."
Fred Bradford called the evening
after his friend's departure, as he had
told blra be would, Intending to re--main
but a few minutes, for be sup
posed be would dad the little miss
studying her lessons, 'What was his
surprise to find her sitting la the draw
ing roam waiting for him, decked out
in the most dawtllng finery she pos
sessed "Papa hns told me that you are to
be my guardian for awhile," she said.
"which Is very nice. And I suppose
the dear old stupid baa instructed you
to prevent my seeing anything of
Bonny Brenaton. Just think of my
being sweet en that kid. Why, he
isn't six months older than I am."
That's fortunate." replied Mr. Brad
ford. "I shan't have to watch you."
"Watch met More likely I'll have to
watch you. Are you sure you've not
get some affair on hand that you
shouldn't havo?"
Sho looked, at him knowingly.
"Good gracldus," he exclaimed men
tally, "does Ilenry consider this girl a
child? Instead of looking out for a
boy lover 1 would better look out for
myself. I'm afraid of all women, and
ono of theso little Imps Is moro capa-
bto of getting n man into trouble than
a woman of thirty."
It's all very well for n mnn to say
"bewaro" when ono of tho opposlto
sex Id thrown suddenly In his path,
but tho trouble Is to heed his own
warnings. Mr. Bradford from the' mo
ment ho entered tho girl's presenco
felt as if a beautiful wasp with velvet
strlfies of yellow and black was buz
zing about him' trying to get an oppor
tunity to Rting blm. Finally lio nroso
to go.
"You don't need any attention from
mo.'Mio said. "I'll toll your father
when ho returns that tho next time
he goes nwdy he'd better put mc'ln
your caro." '
"And you're not coming to sco mo
any more?"
"Why should 17 xou say our father
is mistaken about thto boy; thcroforo
you don't need watching."
"Oh, don't cotno if you don't want
to."
Sho tossed her head as If Mr, Brad
ford and sho wero lovers' in a tiff. Ho
said something in reply, but ho didn't
kndw what It was, nnd really 116' didn't
Intend to conVcy any especial Idea.
Tho next afternoon, whllo looking
out of his club window, who should
pnss but fiio girl bo had promised to
watcu, unvmg an auiomomic, ucsiue
her (ho schoolboy whom Bradford
had promised "to keep away from her.
Ab soon' as he had dined Bradford
went to see her, with" tho Intention of
giving her a good scolding.
"What do you mean," ho said se
verely, "by driving with that boy?"
"Am I to havo no attention what
ever?" sho nuked, cocking her bead on
one ' side rebelllously. "You won't
comb to seo me. I suppose I'll have to
put up with a boy."
Bradford was In a quandary. Ho
wished Martin would cotno homo.
"Will" you promise," ho said presently,
'to let tho boV alone If Income, say,
twfcoT a week ' whllo ydur" father is"
away?"
"Why, certnlnly."
w'brf your honor?" .
"Yes, on my lienor.'' ";
"Very well, I'll' do It." ; .
Ifo kept his word, 'Arid the girl ke'pt
hers. Ho spent two evonlngs a week
With her. and, since her father remain
ed awav two months, bv tho timo ho
returned "Bradford didn't know 'wheth
er 116 wns on hl9 head or' his heels.
Ono evening he lost his grip on him
self and said soma very sweet things
to her, When bo got outside tho cool
air sobered him, and ho could havo
bitten off bis tongue.
Finally his friend returned. Brad
ford called at his oOlco to welcorao
him. Martin took him Jnto his prl'
vuto offlco rind shut tho door.
"Seo here. Fred," said tho latter,
"what have1 you been turning my little
girl's boad for?"
"I turd her bend?"
"Well, sho tells mo that you have J
oeen matting love 10 tier anu buo ret
clprocatea. I don't mind the diff orolice
between your agesf but, you see, she
has several, years at school yet. I
suppose you'll wait"
"Walt? Oh. yes; 1'ir walt-of cbtlrsd
I'll wait'
Til havo to restrict your calling to
.Friday and Saturday evenings. School
takes up tho rest."
"Certainly."
"Come around this evening and we'll
lalk it over. Of courso I'm mighty;
well pleased at tho match,,you Unow.":
'Of courso: nit am I. It's vorjr Jolly,

THE WIDOW
THAT WON
By RQUAD
Cepyrlcht, 1M1, by Assorted Ut
ersry Prs.
As the wife of the village carpeater
Mrs. George Fane had few troubles
and many happy days. They were net
rich, but they had enough to eat aad
fairly good clothes to wear, and the
taxes ob their hose were aoi too high.
Mr. Fane died oae day. That could
be counted aa a trouble, but not too
burdensome t be borne. Time light
ens all griefs, and time lightened this
one for the Widow Fane. When the
year of mourning waa up she found
Solomon Williams, the village black
smith, waiting to say to her:
"Widow Fane, I knew George fer
many years. lie was a good man and
a good husband. I know yeu have
mourned him, but a womaa cu't go
on mourning forever. I want a wife."
"Well, Sol, I'll think It over and let
you know," was the reply.
He called a week later, and she aakl
she would marry him. No courting
and no great display of aeatlawBt.
The wedding was put fer a laeath
ahead, but only two weeks-had elaps
ed when the blacksmith get tangled
up In a thrashing machine he was re
pairing, aad his leg was so badly man
gled that it had to come off. The
widow gave him a month to recover
from the shock and then visited him
to say:
"Solomon, I'm a plain spoken wom
an." "Drive ahead, Mary," be replied.
"1 couldn't marry, a man with a
wooden leg, and you'll have to have
one when you get up,"
Two j months later Farmer Griggs,
widower, called. lie bad Ave children,
and he wanted a wife. He spoke about
the weather and the crops and -then
said:
"Wldder, I wish you would consider
mo. I've often said to myself that you
was a mighty nice woman."
"Give me three days to think it
over."
At tho end ot three dayB Farmer
Griggs called again, to be told that bo
was' accepted.
Four days later a horse kicked Mr.
Griggs smnck in the face and smash
ed his noso so flat that the doctors bad
to mako a long hunt to find it When
they found it they told him that bo
would bo a noseless man from thence
on. Thoro wasu't enough of It to call
a noso any more.
Of courso, tho news was carried to
tho widow. Sho mado thrco or four
calls of condolence and waited six
weeks and then came to tho business
Ju baud by saying;
"Mr. Griggs,; I'm terribly sorry for
you, but I never could marry & man
without a nose."
"Surely you couldn't"
Noi came Mr. Hardy, bachelor, own
er of tho sawmill in the next town,
who drovo over to call. He said. ho
felt embarrassed, but managed to blurt
out Hint If Rhn would innrrv him ho
would be tho happiest man In, the
stato.;
"Well, I kinder want to make folks
happy," wns the reply, "and if you
nro over this way next week drop in."
Mr, Hardy vtan surely "over that
way," and called for his answer, nnd
exclaimed nlo.ud, over his happiness,
Tho weddlngas set four weeks ahead
tl)ls time. When It was known to
tho village there wore peoplo who pre
dicted another" calamity, but the wid
ow smiled ut tho idea. Ill luck never
followed anybody that far. Just a
quiet .wedding and a trip, to Boston, ,
But It was not to be so. In boss
ing around his sawmill, 'nlr. Hardy
got iff tho way of .the saw and. lost,
both legs, at a clip. His llfo was sav
ed, but ho would, bo almost helpless
cripple tho rest of his days. The wid
ow Fane sent him soveralt messages
expressive of pity, but said sho
couldn't marry him. . , -
Throo engagements, .thrco accidents,
three failures to marryl . -.
