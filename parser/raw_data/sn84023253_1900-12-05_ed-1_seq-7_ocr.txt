A Noted Divine on Christian Science.
In an address onChristian Scienceatthe
recent Episcopal church congress, at
Providence. R. I., Rev. E. Winchester
Donald. D. D., rector of Trinity church
Boston, said: "I can easily understand
that Christian Science may seem absurd
to those who are acquainted with it only
from the book, Science and Health,
but those who come in contact with its
disciples daily as citizens and Iriends wi
get another view ot them. As a matter
of demonstrable lact, the Christian Scien
tist shares with other men a power so
rovstenous that it is necessary to say
'We know nothing about it.' It does
only what other cults do in the way
healing men's diseases without the aid of
drugs, holding no monopoly ot the held
of suggestive cures. We know no more
of the essence of electricity today than
we did titty years ago, when it was prac
tically unknown, and so of the force
which the Christian Scientists employ
we do not understand it. A fool or a
bad man may employ it ; a wise man
may not be able to use it at all. It is at
least conceivable that fifty years hence
no man will need a dru or a kuile to
cure his disease, but will employ only
that force which Christian Science em
ploys today.
It has been asserted here that the
reason we ministers are so concerned
about Christian Science is that the peo
ple are leaving the other churches to join
the new cult. I do not think this is true,
lor the reason that a man may be a
Christian Scientist and still be a member
of the Episcopal church.
Is Christian Science leading men out ol
the darkness of unbeliel into the light of
God? Yes, it is, it is; there can be no
doubt about that. You and I know too
many Christian Scientists whose lives
are blameless to doubt that."

NEWS OF THE NAVY.
The Vermont hut be Abandoueil.
Efforts have been made for some time
to have the use of the Vermont as a re
ceiving ship abandoned. It has been tor
sixteen jears the regular receiving ship
at the Brookhn navy yard, and before
that was an adjunct to the receiving ship
Colorado. Admiral Crowninsht'eld, chief
of the Bureau ol Navigation, recently vis
ited the navy yard and ins ected the Ver
mont. Subsiquently he recommended to
the Bureau of Navigation the substi
tution ot barracks for the ship Only
about seven huqdied men can be comfor
tably accommodated on the Vermont,
ah hough as many as fourteen hundred
have been puton herat oie time As only
about time hundied men can be seated
at the tables at once it is necessary to
keep the tables set all dav. The bar
racks would accommodate one thousand

sary for the training ot the men.
Three Admirals for the Asiatic Station.
In recognition ot the large American
interests in the Western Pacific, Secretary
Long has decided to add another flag
fficer to the fleet tn those waters, and
Rear Admiral Frederick Rodgers has
been ordered to prepare to join Rear
AdmiralRemey and Rear-Admiral Kempff
second in command. He has selected
the armored cruiser New York for his
flagship, and orders have been given to
have that vessel ready to start tor China
bv Februarv 1. Rear-Admit al Rodgers
will go out to the Pacific byway of Suez,
and when he arrives there three ditincl-
ve' pennants will fly for ptrhaps the
first time in the American navy. Rear
Admiral Rodgers, who is popularly
known in the service as "Turk" Rodgers,
has been president of the Board ot In
pection ever since the Spanish war. His
service has closely paralleie.1 tnat ot
Rear-Admiral Kempff, who will become
third in command of the station under
he new orders. The two en'ered the
ervice together on Sept. 25, 1857, and
became rear admirals together on March
3, 1899. Naval officers regard them as
ptrhaps the best officers ol their grade in
the service, and express some disappoint
ment that the fleet in the East could not
be divided eciually between them without
making them subordinate to any other
officer. Secretary Long said, however,
that no change is contemplated in the
command of the station, aud that the
detail of Rear-Admiral Rodgers is merely
to give Rear-Ad miral Remey much needed
assistance. Owing to the large size
of the Asiatic squadron aud the im
portant duties devolving upon it just at
present, in consequence of the troubles in
China and the Philippines, it has been
thought expedient to divide the responsi
bilities of the navv in thut quarter
among three admirals instead ot be
tween two, as at present. Rear-Admiral
Remey, the senior officer, will continue in
supreme command ot the naval lorces,
and will act in the character of general
manager ol the opirations of the fleet.
It will remain for him to decide whether
be will take station ashore at Manila or
direct operations Irom on board of one
ol the battleships. The fleet will bed
vided into two divisions, one operating
in Chinese waters and the other in the
Philippine archipelago. Admiral Rodg
ers will undoubtedly be placed in com
mand of the Chinese fleet, giving him the
most important squadron, and it Ad
miral Remey elects to remain afloat in
command of the gunboat flotilla, Ad
miral Kempff will be assigned to the
command of the Cavite naval station
The chances are very strong that either
Admiral Remey or Admiral Kempff, or
both, will decide to come home for retire
tnent.
Rear-Admiral McNair Dead.
Rear-Admiral Frederick V. McNair died
at his nome in Washington Wednesday,
Nov. 28, from a stroke of apoplexy
He had been in poor health lor many
months, and plans bad been considered
to take him to Europe, luesdayhewas
taken violently ill, and Wednesday his
condition became so critical that his at
tending physician called in for consulta
tion one of the navy surg ons, but the
Admiral slowly sank away. He was the
ranking rear admiral ol the navy and the
officer next in line to Admiral Dewey
Frederick Vallette McNair was born in
Pennsylvania in 1839. Upon gradua
tion from the Naval Academy at An
napolis he entered the service as an act
ing midshipman in 1853. He was pro
moted to a lieutenancy in 1861, and dur
ing the civil war was engaged in many
of the most important naval operations.
He served on the Mississippi river under
Admiral Farragut and took part in the
capture of New Orleans in 1862.
Concerning the Vice Presidency.
The vice presidency was originally re
garded as almost on a par with the presi
dency, and the greatest men in the land
eagerly sought it in the beginnings of the
republic. George Washington's vice
president was John Adams, who suc
ceeded him in the presidential office.
John Adams, when president, had
Thomas Jefferson for bis vice president,
and was in turn succeeded by him. Jef
ferson hart a close fight for the first office
with Aaron Burr, whom he dtfeated by
the closest .of margins. Burr took the
lesser office, which he held at the time
be fought that historic and disastrous
duel which resulted in Alexander Hamil
ton's death and put a final period to
Burr's political career. Martin Van
Buren also served as vice president prior
to becoming president. These three men
were elected to the greater othce alter
holding the lesser office, but since Van
Buren no man who had been vice presi
dent has been elected president. Vice
President John Tyler succeeded William
Henry Harrison on tne latter s cieatn, a
month or so after he took the oath of
office, and Millard Fillmore stepped from
the vice presidency into the presidency
upon the death of Zachary Tavlor. An
assassin s bullet put Johnson in tne first
office in the gift of the people, and his
subsequent actions therein almost
brought his deposition therefrom. The
murder of Garfield brought Chester A
Arthur forward, ineseareall the vice-
presidents who have served as presi
dents. Emperior

Mr. Kruger has abandoned his pro
posed visit to Berlin, owing to the re

LESSON THOUGHTS.
The most important part of preaching
is in the hearing. The most eloquet.t
sermon tailing on listless ears is without
any effect; the weakest preaching of the
word of God, attentively heard, is sure
to bear fruit.
Attentive hearing increases our ability
to hear attentively; eaieless hearing,
too, becomes a habit, and makes atten
tive hearing difficult or impossible.
SELECTIONS.
Let not this life's deceitful cans,
Nor worldly wealth and joy,
Nor scorching beam, nor stormy blast,
The rising plant destroy
Where'er the word ot life is sown,
A large inciease bestow;
That all who hear thy message, Lord,
Its saving power may know.
Coarse vices, open or secret, brutalize
the soul. Refined and gilded selfishness
narrows i s sympathies. Evil habits,
long indulged, make it Ccillous. The din
ol woil lly ambitions make it deaf to
heavenly veices, and sublime truths that
ought to thrill it through and through,
fall on dull ears and hard hearts. Hut a
soul may be sermon hardened as well as
sin hardened. People living in sight of
Niagara cease to hear it. An alarm
clock ceases to waken us if we cease to
heed it. Iriesponsive familiarity deadens
the sensibilities; and so even the gospel
may become the "savor of death."
Practice what you hear, it you would
remember it. Heart soil is deepened by
love, bv the rains, the frosts, and the
sunshine of noble, strenuous living.
Upon whomsoever God hath given ears
to hear there rests this fearful responsi
bility, to use the gift of hearing opening
his ears to hear and his heart to feel;
taking in these truths from the great
God and using them unto the everlasting
life of his soul.
