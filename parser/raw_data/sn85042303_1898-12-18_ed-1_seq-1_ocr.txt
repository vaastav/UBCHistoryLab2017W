yonr consideration and appropriate
action, have deemed the occasion
extraordinary and caused your
honorable bodies to assemble in ex
tra session, with the hope and in
sist that your work will be as har
monious and speedy as possible.
Much of the business here sub
mitted is the unfinished business of
your last regular session and from
some unknown cause was not acted
upon by the senate. However, at
this time I urge and insist that
necessary action be taken on the
recommendations which I now submit:
Therefore I recommend the pass
age of a more equitable permit law.
I recommend, with great earnest
ness, the perfection of the act of
the last regular session appropriat
ing the sum of $30,000 to defend
the nation in citizenship cases. For
your information, that you may
appreciate the importance of the
act. I will state that we have now
pending final trial before the Su
the nation. However, on this
proposition and all others herein
submitted I shall be pleased to
hold with you frequent consulta
tions during your session here in
order that our work may be mutu
al and; agreeable, thereby promot
ing the greatest benefit to our nation.
At present I cay say to you that
our matters in general are some
what flattering, with a good pros
pective future. Diligence and wis
dom on our part will, I am prone
to believe, place us in an attitude
which but few of us now expect.
Requesting that you make this
session as brief as may be consist
ent with good work and with the
hope of peace and harmony at all
times prevailing among you, I have
the honor to be resptttfully your
obedient servant,
D. II. JOHNSTON',
Governor Chickasaw Nation
Chickasaw Legislature.
It is learned that the Chickasaw
legislature in session at Tishomin
go is carrying out recommendations
in Gov. Johnston's message deliv'
ered Tuesday. The governors rec
ommendation that a more equitable
permit law be passed was carried
out and a law passed taxing non
citizens $1 for each head of a fam
ily and 25 cents per head for &l,
stock over a certain amount.
One of the most important steps
taken by the legislature was the
passing of the appropriation bil
appropriating $30,000 for the pur
pose of defending the citizenship
cases on appeal in tne supreme
court of the United States at Wash
ington. There are 62 of these cases
on appeal, involving betweet 600

annealed from the United States
court at Ardmore. I. T.. and un
less you provide the necessary
means for the defense of the na
tion in these suits, the majority of
which we believe to be fraudulent
claims, you will have allowed, by
your action, the nation to be rob

dollars. Again I recommend that
you make the necessary appropria
tion for the relief of the Chickasaw
commission, also the freedmen who
mitted in the lower courts, and ap
pealed to the supreme court by the
national government of the Chick
asaw nation.
Another important item was the
canceling of all appropriations for
sending Chickasaw children out of
the nation for the purpose of edu
cation. Heretofore the nation has
been sending a certain number of
Chickasaw children out of the na
tion for schooling and their tuition

men, whose services, I have been
informed by the honorable Dawes
commission, were very valuable
There were also a number of wit
nesses summoned before the Dawes
commission in behalf of the Na
tion, and I recommend that these
witnesses be paid also.
I recommend that you fix the
salary and make the necessary ap
propriation for the Chickasaw coal
trustee, an office created by a pro
vision of the late agreement with
the United States and which was
ratified by act of congress of June
28. 1898. This you will fix as yos
may think best, having due regard
to the work to be performed and
expenses incurred.
I recommend that you make the
necessary appropriation for the

Tho bill for the relief of the
Chickasaw commission with the
Dawes commission ,was passed.
This bill carried with it an appro
priation for $1873.00 to be paid to
the Chickasaw commissioners with
the Dawes commission and also the
freedmen and to pay witnesses that
appeared before the commission in
response to summons or Lonckasaw
commissioners.
This much has been accomplish
ed since the reading of the govern
or's message on Tuesday afternoon.
It is expected that the legislature
will get through with all the busi
ness before it in a few days.
Another Railroad.
A special to the Globe-Democrat
from Washington says:
Senator Jones today intro
duced in the Senate, and Repre
sentative McRae in the House a
bill granting the Little River Val
ley Railroad company of Arkansas
a right of way through the Choc
taw and Chickasaw Nations. The
road is to begin at a point where
the road now intersects the bound
ary line between Arkansas and the
Choctaw nation, in Little River
county, Ark., and run to Atoka,
thence in a northerly direction up
the valley of the Washita river to
the boundary between the Chicka
saw Nation and Oklahoma Terri
tory. The company is to be al
lowed to construct a branch line
from a point opposite Clarksville
and Paris, Texas, and from the
main line, in the Choctaw nation,
to the Red river, on the boundary
between Texas and the Choctaw
nation."

ta's welcome was frosty when com
pared with the outburst which
greeted President McKinley here.
Here, in the cradle of the Confed
eracy, where Jefferson Davis was
inaugurated, a 13-pieal Southern
crowd swarmed the streets and
cheered the President to the echo. '
Gov. Johnston introduced the
President in a few words of warm
feeling, and then President Mc
Kinley responded. He referred to
the emotion he felt at the enthusi
asm with which he was welcomed
to the former capital of the Con
federacy and, continuing, said:
"Once the capital of the Con
federacy, you are now the capital
of a great and glorious state, one
of the indestructible states of an
indestructible Union. We have
nothing to take back for having
kept you in the Union. We are
glad you did not get out, and you
are glad that you stayed in."
