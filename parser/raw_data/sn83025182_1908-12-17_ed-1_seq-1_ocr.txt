President-elect Taft was the guest of

in the Astor gallery of the Waldorf
Astoria hotel were men gathered from
every section of the country and lead
ers in many walks of life.
Taft took advantage of the occasion
in a speech filled with more earnest
ness than any he has delivered since
his election, to pledge his administra
tion and party, as far as he can con
trol it, to a loyal adherence to the
Chicago platform. He dwelt almost
wholly upon the revision of the tarifT,
which he singled out as the most im-.

national convention, and after having
previously referred to the veto power
of the chief executive, said, with all
the emphasis of which he was capa
