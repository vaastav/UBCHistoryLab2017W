POUTS OF LAW
Seizure of a Bicycle for Non
Payment of Installments.
TROUBLES OF A. B. HUEBKEE
Claims Attachments on the Wheel
Wei'j His Personal Property.
DlHtrict Attorney Mnllowny llt-
fuset to Act A Question Vexing:
Jlony Lawyers.
A peculiar state of affairs arising out
of the seizure for non-payment of one in
stallment of one dollar of a bicycle pur
chased fromthe Acme Repair and Bicycle
Company by A. R. Huebner, of .No. 3521
Fifth Streets northwest, is vexing a
number of the lawyers around the City
Hail.
Mr. Huebner conducts a store at No.
1521 Fifth Street and was rather surprised
when his wheel was seized:
He told a Times reporter:
"Wednesday two colored men stopped
in here and asked for a cigar, and while
engaged in waiting- on one the other, who,
1 have since learned, is named Noble
Cooper, in the employ of the Acme Re
pair and Bicycle Company, took my bi
cycle which was standing against the
counter near the door and made away
witii it. I immediately traced hfm down
to tlio Acme Repair and Bicycle Com
pany's store, and went In to inquire about
it. J. E. Shaw and R. AV. AVatts (who
compose the Acme Repair and Bicycle
Company), after a number of interroga
tories by me, stated that they had given
Cooper ?2 to get the wheel and that they
then had the bicycle in their possession.
"The fact upon which they based their
their right to take the wheel is that I
was behind In my payments $1, which
was due December 10. The wheel was
sold to me for $50 on the Installment plan,
und I have paid 532 on it. J. E. Shaw
called for the $1 dueJOecember 10 early in
the morning of that day, and as I was
short of change at the time I asked him
to call later in the day for it. He did not
come again, but took occasion to
decide In his own mind that I had not
come up to my part of the contract, and
obtained possession of the wheel in the
manner indicated. I have since offered
to settle under the terms of the contract,
but he makes a demand for a larger sum
on the grounds that it cost him ?2 to get
ids colored boy to get the wheel back,
and that I must bear that expense before
1 can have my wheel.
"On my wheel were bicycle fixtures
valued at CO cents which were never the
property of that company, and which
were taken with the whefl. If the tak
ing of the wheel is not a violation of the
criminal law, the taking of my bicycle
fixtures is certainly larceny. Even
though the court should decide that these
parties had a right to take the bicycle,
yet the larceny of these bicycle attach
ments deserves punishment, and the of
fense is aggravated at least on account
of the injustice in taking my wheel when
1 was willing, ar.d offered to pay them
all that was due Use day they took it.
"I went to see Proecuting Attorney
Pugh whether or not I could prosecute
the men and he referred me to Mr. Mul
lowny. He told me he could not prosecute
the case, as the mere wrongful taking of
my goods was not larceny when I knew
who took them, unless 1 made demand
for their return and the demand was re
fused, when an action for larceny would
probably stand.
"I consulted an attorney and was ad
vised by liiin that this was a new de
parture in law, and 1 think it well that
the public know that under the latest rul
ing of the prosecuting attorney (Mr. Mul
lowny) you must make demand for the
return of stolen property before Intent
can be shown that it was tykrn feloni
ously." Mr. Huebner wa very indignant at the
way he had been treated, and intends to
seek redress the best way lie can.
A number of cases of this kind have
been brought to the attention of the po
lice court officials, but they are power
less. Acocrding to a decision delivered
several months ago, a company or indi
vidual has no right to seize or cause to
bo seized any property whatsoever that
is being purchased from the company or
individual by another company or indi
vidual on the installment plan, because
of remissness of the party of the second
part in paying the installment.
The decision holds that the party of
the second patt has possession of the
property by virtue of the fact that lie
has paid something for it and is in reality
a, co-partner or shares equal ownership
with the original holder or holders of the
property. In selling bicycles, however.
tho regular installment system Is not car
ried out, and the agreement between the
would-be purchaser and the bicycle dealer
is in the form of a lea&e. The wheel is
leased to the purchaser for a certain
length of time at a stated rate per month.
Mr. Huebner acknowledges the r'ghts
of the bicycle men in seizing the wheel,
but claims they committed larceny in re
taining the attachments, which were hs
personal property. It is claimed that
wheels are often sold by the Acme Bicy
cle and Repair Company that have fixed
on them these sundries, which it appca-s
Mr. Huebner purchased separate, and
these sundries are charged for In the bill.
The only persons who would know wheth
er the purchaser of the wheel bought the
attachments at the same time or separ
ately is the man making the sale, and
the proprietor or bookkeeper of the es
tablishment. It is therefore claimed that when the
wheel In question was seized neither of
these persons were present and the man
making the seizure was not acquainted
with the facts in the case. The taking
of it even then would have been a lar
ceny It is claimed had not the Acme Bi
cycle and Repair Company offered to re
turn the wheel to Mr. Hul Hulbur en
the payment of the costs of the seizure.
The bicycle company also claim that Mr.
Huebner never asked them for the at
tachments he claims belonged to him,
and they were not awr4e that they were
on the wheel.
Huebner has employed able counsel and
will prosecute the bicycle company if
possible. Their act is regarded by others
in the same line of business as a per
fectly legitimate proceeding and the liti
gation which may grow out of it Is only
to determine a-technical point of law.

ANTICIPATING A- HEAVY,
EXPRESS BUSINESS
SPECIAIi INSTRUCTIONS ISSUF1D
Companies Getting Heady for n- Ilcc-
ord-Ilrenkliis; Itnli Hovr to Pack
und Scud Puclcugcs.
The express companies are getting
ready for the handling of a volume of
business that promises to be unprece
dented. Special instructions have been
issued to assist the uninformed. Among
the points which are emphasized are the
following:
All packages ought to be so packed
lhat the ordinary necessary handling
they must have In transportation will not
result in the breakage of the contents.
The strength of the box or. wrapper
must always be proportionate to the
character or weight of the contents
All packages should be well tied, and
should be plainly marked with marking
brusli or a strong tag, or a label written
or printed with plain, black ink. If there
are any old marks or a package they
should be thoroughly obliterated.
If there tire two places of the same
name In the same State the nasne of the
county should be given with the addicts.
It is always well to send a lettci or
postal card of advice by mail notifying
the consignee lhat a package is sent by
express.
Packing in the same box matter that
might injure another class is unwine. Ex
tra care should be taken In packing glass
and fragile articles.
The placing of money in ordinary pack
ages involves a risk. The way to send
money by express is to place it In a pack
age by itself and take a money receipt
for it from the express company.
An important point is the placing on
all packages of the name and address of
the sender, so that in the event of the
consignee not being found at the address
named the sender can be noticed. Often
Christmas presents fail to reach their
destination because of the neglect of the
sender in ignoring simple precautions.

I'olicc (ourt Senucl of mi Attempt
to Itcplcviii u Fair hou-
brette's Trunk.
Benjamin F. Edwards, a constable, was
arrested yesterday afternoon by Polroe
men Cox and Plemmons, of the Sixth
Precinct, charged with disorderly con
duct. The arrest grew out of an attempt
on the part of the constable to replevin
a trunk, the property of Sidonne Dixon,
a fair soubrette, until recently a mem
ber of the Bijou Stock Company, who is
stopping at the theatrical boarding house
of Mrs. Roseberry, at C21 Pennsylvania
Avenue northwest.
Edwards appeared at the boarding
house yesterday afternoon and attempt
ed to remove the trunk, for which he
produced an attachment. Miss Dixon
climbed upon the trunk and positively re
fuscil to permit its removal. Mrs. Rose
berry, at the same time locked the front
door and when the constable attempted
to leave he found himself imprisoned.
lie returned to the room of Miss Dixon
and began blowing distress calls on a po
lice whistle. AVhen Policemen Cox and
Plemmons arrived they could not get in.
Sergeant Lombardy and Detective Harti
gan also appeared and gained access to
the house, but Edwards continued to blow
the whistle, attracting a great crowd.
Edwards was this morning arraigned
before Judge Scott and sentenced to pay
a line of ?10.
AVIre Xnils in Mexico.
In answer to an inquiry as to the nail
trade in Mexico, consular officers have
made reports to the bureau of foreign
commerce of the State Department. Con
sul General Barlow writes from the City
of Mexico that there are many more wire
than cut nails used in the republic. He
gives as a reason that there are more
wire than cut nai's in a kilogram while
the duty is the same. There art but two
nail-making cones-as of an importance
in Mexico. For mess I he inatcr.al is im
ported from the United States. The
trade is handled through jobbers 'Barb
ed wire is now extensivelj' used in Mexi
co. During the fiscal year 180G-"97, there
was imported into the repurdlc from tho

at $115,000.

THINGS THEATRICAL.
Olga Nethersole, who may with some
degree of fairness lay claim to being the
greatest of English actresses, will be
next week's attraction at the Lafayette
Square Opera House. During her engage
ment Miss Nethersole will present two
new efforts and three of her past suc
cesses, the whole forming a repertoire of
great strength. The order of the presen
tations admits of "The Second Mrs. Tan-
queray" being done on Monday, "Car-1
men" on Tuesday, "Frou Frou" on
Thursday, "Camille" on Friday and "The
Termagant" on AVednesday and Saturday
evenings and at the Saturday matinee.
One of the brightest musical comedies
of last season, "The Frencli Maid,"
comes to the National next week for the
usual series of eight performances. The
piece was done here a year ago and made
a distinct impression by reason of its wit,
its delicacy of plot and its delightful rau
slc. The scenery and costumes used in
the production have been highly praised,
while the cast is one of uniform ability.
Among its members are Charles A. Bigc
low, Anna Held, llalien Mostyn, AVilliam
Armstrong. George Honey, Augustus
Sohlke, Eva Davenport, Yolande ATal
lace and Mamie Forbes.
George F. Nash, Geoffrey Stein, Edith
Ethelstone. Irma La Pier, Jessie Burnett
and several other capital people will be
seen next week at the Columbia in "A
Bachelor's Honeym'oon." This is the
work of John Stapleton and was original
ly produced last year at Hoyt's Theater,
where it ran for something like two
months. The play is said to be excruci
atinglj' funny and should draw exceed
ingly well. All the scenery, costumes and
properties used at the premiere are car
ried with tho combination and it Is prom
ised, therefore, that the performance
will be a perfect one. Seats went on sale
Thursday.
"Down in Dixie," one of the oldest of
the Davis and ICeogh presentations, will
be seen on Monday night at the Acad
emy of Music. The play is a melodrama

AVhat is the use of making a better ar
ticle than your competitor if you cannot
get a better price for It?
Ans. as there is no difference in the
price the public will buy only the better,
so that while our profits may be smaller
on a single sale they will be much greater
in the aggregate.
How can you get the public to know
your make is the best?
If both articles aro brought prominently
before tho public both are certain to bs
tried and the public will very quickly pass
judgment on them and use only the bet
ter one.
This explains the large sale on Cham
berlain's Cough Remedy. The people have
been using it for years and have found
that it can always be depended upon.
They may occasionally take up with some
fashionable novelty put forth with ex
aggerated claims, but are certain to re
turn to the one remedy that they know to
be reliable, and for coughs, colds and
croup there is nothing equal to Chamber
lain's Cough Remedy. Fr sale by Henry
Evans, AA'holesale and Retail Druggists,

Avenue and S Street northwest, and 1423

duces the fare to Arlington on Sundays. Tomor
row will be no exception to the general rule,
and tickets will be sold for 13 cenls for the
round trip. Strangers in the city will find these
