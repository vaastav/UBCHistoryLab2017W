War Department Will Investigate,
i Washington, Dec 3. The war de
partment Is preparing for an inves
tigation by congress of the case of
the companies of the 2Jth Infantry re
cently discharged without honor by
order of President Roosevelt, and to
this end has compiled a record of
negro troops dating back to the Civil
war. It is said that this record dis
closes a state of affairs not generally
known and that once before at least
the 25th Infantry "shot up a town"
the affair bnppcued In 1885 at Fort
Stugls, Dakota. Some of tho negro
soldiers went on n rampage similar
to that at Ilrowusville, Tes, and one
of tbelr number killed a citizen. The
citizens took the matter Into their
own hands, forced the troopers under
pain of death to disclose the name of
the man who did the killing and then
took him out and lynched him.

aker, it is understood, will offer in

PMNCETOX, Ky, Dec. 3.-The to
bacco stemmeries of John Steger and
John G. Orr here, the latter controlled
by the Imperial Tobacco company of
New York, were destroyed by n Are
which was kindled against them by
mob of masked men. Several cottages
In the vicinity were badly damaged,
but nobody was hurt The losa Is es
timated at about $170,000.
The mob, which numbered about 300
men, entered Princeton between 1 and
2 a. m., seized the town marshal and
disarmed him, took charge of the po
lice station and the waterworks nnd
set fire to the buildings. Even bad
the fire company responded they would
have been nnable to obtain water.
Masked men stood on guard, permit
ting nobody to come near until the
buildings were completely enveloped
In Hames. A squad took charge of the
telephone office, and no word of the
affair was permitted to go out
When the members of the mob saw
that the fire was beyond control they
left the town, going In the direction of
Hopkinsrllle, discharging revolvers and
rifles. The fire department then came
out, but could only prevent the fire
from destroying nearby buildings.
The work of the mob is believed to
be only n furtherance of the agitation
by the tobacco ratsera against the so
called tobacco trust

Attorney Went at Length Into Case
and Made Able Plea
' ' For Client
Herkimer, N. Y., Dec 3.. Chester
E. Gillette probably will know his
fate before another day dawns. Tho
final scenes In the remarkable trial
of the young factory foreman ot Cort
land, who is charged with having
slain Grace Brown, his sweetheart,
will be enacted to-day. District At
torney Ward will review the evidence
which has been placed befbre the
Jury and demand that the prisoner
be forced to answer with his life the
happenings of that day on Big Moose
lake when Grace Brown went to her
death. . Gillette's counsel will argue
that Miss Brown went to her death
a suicide, the result of her own vol
untary act. ,
To-day's session promises to be a
long one. The opening of court was
delayed for some time, as Judge
Devendorf was obliged to open
regular term of court before the Gil
lette case was resumed. The Judge
has said, however, that the lateness
of assembling will not be permitted
to interfere with the completion of
the' case to-day. He baa announced
that a night session will be held If
necessary to give the attorneys time
to conclude their arguments. For
mer Senator Mills, Junior counsel for
Gillette, will make the final argument
for the defense.
SI las D. Feeter, a civil engineer,
was called by the defense when the
trial was resumed to-day. Ho said
he had been to South bay, Big Moose
lake, within a few days and made
measurements at the point where the
overturned boat was found
"At that place the water is seven
and a halt feet deep," he said.
Mr Ward objected, because condl
tlons are n6t the same now a they
were July 1.1, when Grace Brown's
death occurred. It had been testified
by witnesses for the people that the
water was four and n half feet deep
where the boat was found and on
cross-examination Mr Feeter admit
ted that there was a big difference
in the water line when he made the
soundings and last July, vhn the
alleged tragedy took place,
"The summer shrubbery that was
growing last July Is now covered with
water," he said.
District Attorney Ward called Ju
llan A. Van Wle as his witness Mr
Van Wle Is manager of n cycle com
pany in Cortland.
"I have aeen Chester Gillette sev
eral times," he said: "the first time
In my place of business."
"What was the transaction, If
any?" asked Mr Ward.
This was objected to. as reopening
the people's case, and District At
torney Ward did not Insist upon an
answer. The objection was sus
tained. "The people rest," announced Mr
Ward.
"Anything for the defense?'! naked
Justice Devendorf.
"Nothing more," waa the answer.
and all was ready for the summing
up.
Justice Devendorf asked If the
counsel wanted to be limited In time
for their addresses. "I do not pro
pose to limit you unless yon desire
It," he said.
There was no request for time II m
itatlon.
Mr Mills began his summing np
address for the defense nt f-30. He
said:
I congratulate yon that this case
comes to n close. At last this toung
man a mere boy comes 'o a body
of men who In law nnd fac' aro his
friends. He knows tbst In your
minds be will receive Impartial con

Mr Mllla referred to DrVt At

ing of the "eye witness of the trag-l
edy. promise of marriage ear the
wedding clothe.
"The opening was n crl'lcal time
and some may have gained false Im
pressions from these statement, he
said..
Bat every and nny fact In fvvor of
this boy should have been produced."
said Mr Mills. "Altboncb It la not

another.'
Mr Ward and Sheriff Rkrards bad

Mr Mills asked tbst sperUt atten
tion be given to the new-smpers.
The yelping cry of the pnbllr preas

first to last. I honor nnd respect
ansae writers, bnt there are others
tbst nm not worthy of iw'm t. nnd

ta. I el Instiled tn neenMoniag
ens paper whose mendacity bnt
appalling, whose stories were terri
ble." s
No mention of the paper was made.
"Gentlemen," he continued, "in
the law this boy Is Innocent until It
Is established he is guilty. In this
case there Is a far stronger presump
tion one almost satisfying that
this boy is Innocent. He hid no bad
habits, no rowdyism attended him;
but they say he auddenly rose up, de
liberated for a week, and comrcitted
the terrible crime of murder.'
"It appears that this boy had re
lations with this young woman, but
other men have i overstepped the
bounds of propriety. She was 26
years old; he was 23. T'el- rela
tions society calls Improper, but they
were only natural.- He is not to be
punished for that, not convicted for
that :"- i .;
"The only question is: 'Did this
boy on July 11 last, on Big Moose
lake, take the life of Grace Brown
against the laws of the state?' , You
may not favor his relation, but you
shall not consider them in arriving
at your verdict."
Mr Mills started to speak on what
he termed a miscarriage ot justice In
Vermont, and the district attorney
objected. Justice Devendorf ; said
that the purpose of a summing up is
to review the evidence. '
. , Mr Mills did not press his point.
"Think of the proposition that has
been shown as an adequate motive
for the cruel murder of a Bwjet young
girl. He had been in soctety and
about with friends. Does thl" o to
show that he contemplated the crime
of murder? 1
"Had he been about to marry some
one, and been embarrassed by a lia-
son with another, there might have
been a motive. But there was none
here."
Mr Mills said Gillette had no spe
cial attratcion in Cortland, and it
would have been an easy matter for
him to have gone away. He and Miss
Brown simply met, and went away
to talk It over, to plan for tha future,
and yet they say he killed Grace
Brown so he might stay in Cortland.
Why, he had not even his parents
there."

THE CORONER'S VERDICT.
Finds Engineer Easton Criminally
Setnonsible for Acicdent.
New Haven, Dec 3. Coroner Mix
to-day rendered his findings in the
investigations of the railroad acci
dents at Cedar Hill, November 26.
and at Yalesvilie, November 29, in
which four men lost their lives
three Italian laborers in the first
collision and Conductor "William
Leary of Springfield in the second
one,
The coroner finds that Engineer
Harry W. Easton of New Haven was
criminally responsible for the Yales
vilie accident as he neglected to heed
a banjo signal set against him and
that Engineer George O. Devine was
criminally responsible for the Cedar
Hill crash as be kept his train run
ning despite the signal given him by
Hrakeman Waterman. Easton and
Devine, who had been held by the
coroner, were arrested to-day as the
result of the coroner's finding and
probably will be given a hearing to
morrow. Each furnished bonds of
$1,000.
In his report of the Yalesvilie ac
cident the coroner says that the ban
Jo signal Is 1,600 feet south of the
Yalesvilie station, while the freight
train which Easton's engine ran Into
was several hundred feet north ot
the station. The freight was going
st the rate of ten miles an hour and
the big moguls north bound running
backward, were speeding along at
the rate of twenty miles an hour.
ine coroner says mat tners was n
clear view of the track ahead for n
distance of 900 feet which should
.V.. li.i .
which to see the slowly going north
bound tre'ght.
In regard to the Cedar Pill Affair

given to Engineer Devine thnt there
was a train ahead, bnt It was not
heeded, the result being that the '
train, loaded with laborer, bumned
Into a stalled gravel train, three Ital- i
lans bring Instantly kll'ed and sev-
erai injured. Tn coroner also finds
that Conductor William 1. Caey of
the train bearing the Italians was
not at his post of duty and says that
hile he Is not rrlmlna'ly responsible
for the accident he Is deserving of n
severe censure.
