THE FOREST REPUBLICAN.
J. K. WCNK.
CDITON 4 PKOPHItTOH.
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1S!8.
Government expenditures were
larger than the reviuue last year, but
it took a war to keep down ao old
fashioned Republican surplus.
Plainly the coming of MeK'inley
prosperity has wiped out a great part
of the discontent which gave the sil
ver agitation its strength at tbe West
The Nicaraugua caual should be
built and controlled by ibis govern
ment. Such is the position taken in
the inessuge and backed up by tbe
people almost unanimously.
"The largest volume of business
ever recorded" is mentioned a the
messago us a proof of prosperity.
Tbat this should come to pass in a
year of war is a remarkable circum
stance. Montojo's ten war-ships at Manila
are referred to by the resident as a
"formidable fleet." There has been
an effort to disparage those ships, but
their armament in some respects was
better than Dewey's.
The Cubans will notice that the
President fully recoguizes thoir right
to cbooee tbeir free form of govern
ment as soon as the island is thor
oughly pacified. If they have any
doubt iu this subject the message will
remove it.
The total number of killed and
wounded in both array anil navy in
the war with Spain is stated in the
message to be 1GG8. No one sup
posed at the beginning of hostilities
that casualties could be kept down In
this extent.
Evidently the tarifT wall around
this country is uot so high tbat ex
ports cannot jump over it. The for
eign trade of the United States is now
nearly $2,000,000,000 a year and the
increase iu the volume of exports was
$107,000,000 during tho past e;ghi
months.
The only material difference be
tweeu tbe government of Hawaii and
New Mex ico, Arazooa, or Oklahoma,
after the bill carrying out the rec
ommendations of the Hawaiian com
mission has become law, as it is sure
to in due lime, will be that in the
former territory there will be a prop
erty aud ao educational qualification
for suffrage.
ThE caucus for the nomination of a
Republican candidate ' for United
States Senator will be held, accord
ing to present understanding, on the
evening of Jonuary 4, the day after
the meeting of the legislature. The
first ballot for Seuator will be taken
in the two houses of the Legislature
separately at 3 o'clock on the after
noon of January 17 aud on the fol
lowing day both houses will meet in
joint convention at noon to compare
the vete. If one person bas received
a majority in each bouse his election
will be declared. If not, and one
house bas given a majority for one
pers.n and the other for another per
eon, a vote will be taken in joint con
vention, and the majority of the two
branches voting together will deter
mine the election.
General Garcia, the noted Cu
ban patriot, died in Washington Sun
day morning. His name will be ever
linked with thosa of other patriots
who have fought against uuequal
odds, for the freedom of his country,
and hag had a most active and varied
life, much of which has been spent in
fighting for the cause of Cub.u lib
erty, which he had the Ealisfactiou of
seeing accomplished so short a time
before his death. He was a man of
culture and refinement, of splendid
education and came from a distin
guished family of Jaiquani, of Santi
ago de Cuba province. He was born
in Colquin, October 14, 1839, and
was tberelore in tbe COih year of his
age. General Garcia a as educated
iu Havana and in Spain. In 18C4
be was married to Isabel Velez.
The distinguished Cavelry Gen
eral Joo Wheeler of Alabama, iotro
duced a resolution in tbe House of
Representatives at Washington, on
Monday providing that in "recog
nition of the devotion aud bounteous
benevoleuce of Miss Helen Miller
Gould to the soldiers of the army of
the United Siates during the war
with Spain, tbe thanks of Congress
hereby authorizes and directs tbat a
gold medal with appropriate designs
be prepared by tbe Director of the
Mint, and that said medal be pre
seoted to her by the President of the
United States at such time and in
such manner as be may determine."
Th s resolution should pass both
booses of Congress without delay and
by a unanimous vote. Miss Gould is
in every way worthy of this recog
oition.
Condensed History.
Here it is in nutshell from the
Chicago Iieeord:
War declared by the United States
on Spain April 21.
Peace protocol signed August 12.
Peace commission assembled Octo
ber 1.
Terms of peace accepted by Spain
November 28.
Spain relinquishes Cuba without
conditions.
Spain cedes Porto Rico, tbe Philip
pines and Guam.
The United Statts gives Spain
$20,000,000.
Tbe United States promises protec
tion to the property of Spaniards.
Each country to have equal trade
privileges.
Each country to settle the claims
for damages of its owu citizens grow
ing out of the war.
The bills which have been intro
duced to both House aud Senate for
the reorganization of the army do not
follow the recommendations of Gt-n.
Miles, because it is not believed that
a bill carrying as many high otlicers
as he recommends could get through
Congress. The bills introduced pro
vide for a Lieut. Geo , six Maj. Gens,
and twelve Brie. Gens.
A New York paper says "it must
be a film purpose not to dim the lus
ter of the w r heroes that is keeping
Mr. Diugley from pointing out how
tbe result of the election is a vindi
cation of the existing tariff law." Mr.
Dingley doesu't have to "point out"
any benefits that accrued from the
tariff law. The people know that
protection made prosperity, and Re
publican prosperity made Republi
can victory certain.
Speaker Reed had a very pleas
ant conference this week with Presi
dent McKinley and arranged for an
other to take place as soon as the
Speaker has conferred with his Re
publican colleagues on the House
committee on Rules and the other
Republican leaders in the House, and
they have agreed upon the legislative
program to he followed at this sess
ion As boo j as that progrrm has
been determined upon the Speaker
will submit it to the President for ap
proval and amendment. The same
harmony that existed at the last sess
ion between the executive and legis
lative branches of the government is
to be continued, so far as it is in the
power of the Republicans in the
House to continue it. Tbe Senate,
on account of its present make-up
no party with a majority is neces
sarily an uncertain quautity in the
legislative program.
In his message to Congress Presi
dent McKinley has made these rec
ommendations: Increase of the teg
ular at my to 100,000 men. Increase
of the navy by the addition of three
battle sbips, three first-class cruisers
and many smaller vessels. Tempo
rary revival of tbe rank of admiral
and vice-admiral. Construction of
the Nicaragua canal under Ameri
can influence. Holding greenbacks
once redeemed in gold, os a fund only
to be paid out of the Treasury in ex.
change for gold. Retention of war
revenue measures for the present.
Increased appropriation for Ameriean
represantatioo at the Paris exposition
and permanent commission to attend
lo this country's interests in future
international expositions. A well de
fined maritime policy, made necessary
by our changed relations to Cuba,
Porto Rico and other recent posses
sions of Spam. Iuternatioual agree
ment to protect private property aud
ships from seizure in time of war.
President McKinley by tho wise
omission from his annual message to
Congress has greviously disappointed
the Democrats. That is why the
whole menagerie is snarling. They
thought, or had persuaded themselves
that they thought, the President
would announce a hide-bound policy
towards the Philippines in advance of
the actual possession of those islands
by the United States, hut the Presi
deut isu't that kind of a statesman.
He doesn't make up his mind upon
any subject blindfolded, least of all
unon sued an important one as tbe
future of 8,000.000 helpless people.
He has delivered them from the evils
of Spanish rule, and will give them a
military government that will he far
better than nny government they
have ever k own. That is far enough
to go for som time to come. He will
know more about (he subject before
recommending the next step. There
are other omissions from the message
that aro equally wise, and they are
equally as nagging to the Democrats,
who have no other hope for future
success than tho mistakes tbey ex
pect the Republicans to make. Pres
ident McKinley possesses the faculty
of knowing what not to say as well
as what to say. Tbat is one reason
bis administration is such a success,
The Protect inn of growing Aineri
-au industries bas resulted iu making
this country tho master of the situa
tion. Tho warning that a Protective
tariff would kill our foreign market
has been proved almost ludicrously
absurd bv the marvelous strides of
our commerce. The Orient is now
nur field, and it is still as exporters,
and not as importers, we shall com
mand it.
It is to be borne in mind that
the United States is now selling
abroad far more than it is purchas
ing. Notwithstanding the relative
decrease in imports as compared with
exports, the Dingley law receipts are
more than holding their own a;
against the eturns under previous
acts. A law that makes such a show
ing is a pretty good one. And that
is a reason why the country wants
the present tariff let alone.

What is the uso of tnakiog a better ar
ticlo than your competitor if you cannot
get a bettor price for it?
Ans. As there is no difforence in the
price the public will buy only the better,
so that while our profits may bo smaller
on a single sale they will be much great
er in the aggregate.
How can you i et the public to know
your make is the best?
If both articles are brought prominent
ly before the public both are certain to be
tried and the public will very quickly
pass lodgment on them and use only the
better one.
This explains the lame sale on Cham
berlain's Cough Remedy. Tho people
have been using it for years and have
lound that it can always be depended up
on. They may occasionally take up with
some fashionable novelty put forth with
exaggerated claims, but are certain to re
turn the remedy that they know to be re
l.ahle. and for nnuirtiH. poMa ami
