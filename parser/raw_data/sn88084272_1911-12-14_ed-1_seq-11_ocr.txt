Vienna,- Austria. Dec 14. -Another

dry official announcement thatt em
peror Francis Joseph has placed the
arch duke Henry Ferdinand, brother of
the princess Louise of Saxony, and of
arch duke Leopold Salvatore. "on
leave with the stoppage of all emolu
ments." Arch duke Henry Ferdinand, who Is
t painter with great distaste for court
life and military des, has been liv
ing for some time In Munjeh. He has
desired for a long period" to abandon
I his rank and title in the same way as
arch duke John Ortta, -reb,- duke Leo-,
pold Salvatore, and more recently areh
duke Ferdinand Charles, in order, as is
reported, that he might marry a Mu
nloh girl belonging t a family not of

Finding this to be difficult, the areh
duke has taken the easier course of
throwing up his military career.

FINANCIAL
HEAVY BUYING IS
Ti HELP STOCK
Shares of IT. S. Steel Eeaeli
Highest Figure Since
September
New York, N. Y., Dec. 14. Further
heavy buying of United States Steel
stimulated the stock market for a time
this morning, although, the movement
was not of long duration. The steel
shares reached the highest figure since
September. A large part of the buying
was attributed to the demand from the
short interest1 which became alarmed
at reports of Increased prices ..and
heavy orders In the Iron and steel
trade. The metal group was strength
ened by the advance In the price of
copper by some producers to 14 cants,
the highest figure for. several years.
Selling pressure increased toward
noon, the hears operating with some
confidence on the theosy that the
standard railroads had not shared pro
portionately' with the outgrowth of
strength in the inat&l Issues and the
bidding up ef steel, and copper stocks
had been too precipitate. United States
Steel fell to 6. Union Pacific sold
a point under yesterday's closing and
various other stocks about a point.
Erie stocks were rushed up 1. to 2
points, and there was a further rise
of 1 in Agricultural Chemical.
Bonds were irregular. '
Profit taking sales on announcement
that American Agricultural Chemical
had been placed on a 4 pereent dividend
basis canceled most of Its advances.
The rest of the list was withput con
spicuous change, speculation being dull
and prices hovering close to the low
est A buying movement sprang up in
the local stocks. Central Railroad, of
New Jersey, jumped 10 points. Lehigh
Valley and Reading were active and
gained a point each.
The tone of the whole market was
better, with business showing a marked
Increase on the recoyery- loulsvlye &
Nashville went off 2 In short order
but later made up half of lt3 loss.
The close was steady. t

veying It to San Francisco and oon
ceallng It there In a vacant boose, were
recalled by the procession of witnesses
who passed into and out of the federal
grand Jury rooms here. Hardly any of

and the appearance of some before the
grand Jury was mueh briefer. Every
one, seemingly, who could know any
thing about that part of MeNamara' 3
activities was among the witnesses
summoned.
Cast John Peterson of the launch
Pastime had a family party. He ap

Fred Banke, a clerk In an automobile
sales establishment In San Francisco,
appeared. Banke sold MeNamara some
canvas, which was used as a severing

The rapidity with which the wit
