Apparatus to Empty Canal Boats.
Following In some ways the general
lines of the car dumpers in use on the
Great Lakes, an apparatus is to he
built in Philadelphia for the Lehigh
Navigation Company which will take
hold of a canal boat, elevate it 60 feet
in the air, and empty its contents
either on the wharf for conveyance to
a storage pile, or into the hold of an
other vessel.

Hundreds have paid the cost of their farms (if

Living Up to Youth.
"How do you keep bo youthful?"
somebody, says a London correspond
ent, recently asked King Edward VII.
Thereupon his majesty is alleged to
have replied: "The secret is, to sur
round yourself with a younger genera
tion than your own, and to live up to
It." The story may not be authentic;
for royalty, even when genial and pop
ular, does not permit Itself to be cate
chized in any such tactless, free-aid-easy
fashion. But the king might havo
made the reply truthfully; and it is a
true saying, whether he said it or not
Two Americans of GO odd, friends in
earlier years, met after long separa
tion, and one, who was an old man
and admitted it, said, almost fretfully,
to the other, "Why are you so young?"
The other, who had been for half his
life the head of a public school, looked
toward the splendid building that shel
tered a thousand boys and girls. "With
that great wave of youthfulncss beat
ing up against me all the time, how
can I grow old?" he answered. The
schoolmaster would have been war
ranted in using the words attributed to
the king. Encompassed by youth, and
glad to be so, he "lived up to it." That
would mean, perhaps, says the Youth's
Companion, that he clung to his early
enthusiasms, including many which
aping men might term illusions; that,
while he thought and spoke sincerely,
he kept a generous belief In others;
that he refused to brood over the past,
made much of the present, and looked
always hopefully toward the future.
For living up to youth means cherish
ing its spirit; and upon the spirit of
youth Time hesitates to lay a wither
ing hand.
Not a Meddlesome Commission.
The first hearing of the Commission
on Country Life, held at College Tark,
Md., served to dispel some erroneous
notions as to the purposes of that
body. Trof. L. 11. Dailey in an address
explained that the commission has no
.dea of "Investigating" the farmer.
The design is not to go about inquir
ng officiously and offensively Into mat
ters which are really of a private ma
ture, but to get at facts which can be
useful and valuable to all concerned.
For some reason, says the Troy (N.
Y.) Times, there have been attempts
to create the belief that the commis
sion is likely to be meddlesome and
unduly prying. Nothing could be far
ther from the intention, and a state
ment by way of explanation from a
man of Prof. Bailey's character and
standing is quite sufficient to set mat
ters right. Prof. Billey ft one of the
most successful teachers of practical
farming in the country, and those as
sociated with him on the commission
re workers along the same line. The
result of the commission's efforts can
not fail to be highly valuable to agri
culturists. Lately an educational expert stigma
tized American women the laziest in
the world, and as bringing up their
children In the same path of slothful
avoidance of all trouble and effort.
Now a western man, speaking at a
meeting of a patriotic society, declares
that the women of the day have de
teriorated, and that few would follow
their husbands into privation and dan
ger, as did the wives of the pioneers
of American history. It is easy to
make these wholesale, superficial
charges and the ease, apparently, is
making it a fashion, but the men mak
ing them would find it hard to prove
them. The women of the nation, as a
whole, are as womanly and as whole
some as they ever were. If the con
trary were the case, this country would
not to-day be occupying its proud po
sition among the nations of the world,
for every nation is what its women
make it. It is time to call a halt on
these reckless seekers for relief, re
gardless of truth.
One of the teachers in the Vevaj
schools the other day asked her class
the origin of the word stateroom, as
applied to berths on steamboats. Not
anc in the class could answer the
question, and we doubt if there are
many people who could. The word,
says Vevay (Ind.) Reveille, originated
with the newspapers many years ago.
At that time a magnificent steamer
was built and 35 sleeping rooms were
made alongside the cabin. At that
time there were 35 states In the union,
and a room as named for each state.
Later the state of Texas was added to
the union, and the sleeping apartments
set aside for the officers of the boat
was dubbed "Texas."
The English suffragettes are now
about to organize a cavalry troop
among themselves, being tired of
walking and believing that when
mounted they will have an advantage
over the police in their suffrage par
ades. If they don't watch out parlla
ment and the cabinet will be captured
bodily by these aggressive ladles yet.
New York's Consumption of Tea.
New Yorkers drink tea as well as

WHERE'S CASHIER
FOGELSANG GONE
rHE BANK AT 8PRINGPORT WAS
RUN UNDER PECULIAR
CONDITIONS.
FOGELSANG'S ODD WAYS.
Examination Now Going on to Find
How and Where Funds Went That
Made a Near Wreck.
The Springport State bank, now in
the hands of the state bank examiner,
is on the rocks, but Just how hard It
will take some days to determine. It
seems that Cashier Fogelsang got af
fairs badly tangled before the direc
tors were aware of it. The bookkeep
ing is queer and the disappearance of
Fogelsang does not give matters a
good appearance. Certificates have
been found since the closing of the
bank several days ago in which the
amount is different than the amount
entered in the register for each of the
same certificates. In response to a
printed request farmers are bringing
in their certificates to the bank so
that a comparison can be made t"
ascertain whether the certificates had
been entered by Fogelsang as paid.
In addition to his banking duties.
Fogelsang was administrator of two
estates. One was the L. P. Novls
estate, said to be worth about $20,000.
Much of it is supposed to be In mort
gages and cash. Novis was elected
vice-president when it was reorgan
ized and died soon afterwards. Fogel
sang gave a surety company bond of
J5.000 as the administrator of this es
tate. The other tstate is the Martin
Austin, and is a farm estimated at
$5,000. How his accounts with each
cf these estates stand is not known
i.t the present time. As cashier of the
bank he also was bonded ror jo.unu.
More or less Springport people have
felt that Mrs. Roberts Intended to be
queath practically her entire estate to
Fogelsang, but now they are not so
sure of it.
The dealings of Young, the hay
ing, began back in the private bank,
in a word, he would make a hay ship
ment, make a sight draft on the ship
ment, deposit the bill of lading in the
bank and then check against it. Just
how many of these bills of lading are
still alive is one of the things the
hanking examiner Is trying to ascer
tain. To do this will be a task of
some days, as some of the shipments
have gone as tar south as New Or
leans and as far east as the Atlantic
seaboard.
The complaint against Fogelsang is
signed by Director Crawford, and re
cites that Nov. 5 last the cashier with
!ntent to defraud entered on the
bank's books as paid a certificate of
deposit for $105 issued to John
Walker, a young farmer, when in fact
it had not been paid. Young, the hay
king, whenever the examiner tells him
how much he owes the bank, will take
care of the indebtedness.
Mis Lennon Exonerated.
The Duffy murder trial in Saginaw
began in earnest with the opening
statement of Prosecutor Purcell, who
took about an hour to outline the case
of the state. Purcell declared the state
would prove beyond a resonable doubt
that Duffy carried Myrtle Lennon's
month old baby from near the Pere
Marquette railroad station on the
night of August 5 and deliberately
drowned it in the Saginaw river. Pur
cell asserted the evidence to be con
clusive that Duffy met the girl he is
accused of wronging the night 6he left
the hospital with the infant for the
preconceived .purpose of murdering
the child and that he obtained pos
session of it from her only by deceiv
ing Miss Lennon with the story that
he had secured a good home for It in
Saginaw.
Purcell further said that evidence
as to the actual commission of the
crime was circumstantial, but so
strong as to prove absolutely a case
of wilful murder. He absolved Miss
Lennon from all responsibility for the
crime.
Liquor at the State Fair.
The State Association of Farmers'
Clubs of Michigan, in annual session
in Lansing, directed a committee to
report a resolution asking the legisla
ture to withhold any future appropria
tions for the aid of the state fair at
Detroit until the sale of liquor on the
grounds is prohibited and other ob
jectionable features are eliminated. In
speaking in favor of the motion. T. J.
Daniels, of St. Johns, said it was too
bad that some broad-gauged farmer
was not at the head of the fair.
The committee on temperance re
ported favorably state wide prohibition
and commended the work of the Anti
Saloon league. The resolutions cover
ing these subjects were adopted.
Money Awaits Her.
Twenty-seven years ago Delia Brad
ley, of Ionia, then 4 years of age, dis
appeared. Her disappearance closely
followed the separation of her parents
and it was suspected at the time that
her mother was Involved In the abduc
tion of the child. Since that time
neither mother nor child has been
seen.
The father Is dead and an estate is
now being probated In the Ionia pro
bate court In which the child, if now
living, is an heir-at-law and entitled
to about $400 as her share of the es
tate. The building of John Karents. at the
Sunday Lake mine location, Wake
field, caught fire and his two children,
girls, aged two and five years, were
burned to death. Their bodies were
found among the debris laying in each
others' arms.
Cieorge D. ' Waterman Und Marie

HERE'S A ROW.
Congress and President Have a Sharp
Scrap" Started.
The breach between the president
and the house is a fact, no longer a
possibility. The defl flung down by the
executive In his message has- been
taken up, and unless the frantic ef
forts of the close Roosevelt coterie In
congress prevail with the angry states
men, the present session Is going to
make a place for itself in history by
the open and defiant enmity displayed
between the body, regardless of par
tisanship, and a retiring executive.
This is the cause of the excitement:
"The chief argument In favor of the
provision was that the congressmen
did not themselves wish to be investi
gated by secret service men."
Immediately after the opening of
the house Friday, Rep. Perkins, of
New York, introduced a resolution di
rected at the president. It provided
for the appointment of a special com
mittee of five to consider the proper
means of dealing with that portion
of the president's message criticising
congress for passing the present law
which restricts the activity of secret
service agents. The resolution Is pre
ceded by a preamble which recites
some exprersions of the message.
The resolution was adopted, and the
following special committee named:
Messrs. Perkins, New York; Denby,
of Michigan; Weeks, of Massachu
setts; Williams, of Mississippi, and
Lloyd, of Missouri.
Republican senators today consid
ered what action should be taken by
the senate concerning the message of
the president and it was practically
decided to permit the resolution to be
brought in by some Democratic sen
ator. The resolution will provide for
an Investigation of the whole subject
by the senate committee on appropri
ations. Two presidents in the history of
this country have actually been re
buked by congress. One was John
Tyler, who sent a message to the
house strongly criticising it. The
house refused to receive the message
and passed resolutions of blunt cen
sure. The other was Gen. "Old Hick
ory" Jackson, fire-eater and original
big stick wielder. Ho clashed with
a senate made up of fearless men. and
when they passed a resolution criticis
ing him, and he sent in a hot mes
sage of protest, the senate flatly re
fused to receive it.
A Terrific Blast.
A giant blast of dynamite, prepared
for firing, was prematurely exploded
in the workings on the Panama canal
in Bas Obispo Saturday. Ten men
were killed and 50 injured.
It may be that others have been
killed, for the debris Is piled in all di
rections. Bas Obispo cut is about 30
miles from Colon and the shock of
the explosion was distinctly felt.
Numerous reports are current as to
the accident, but the official version
from Culebra states that during the
loading of the last hole of the blast
the dynamite was discharged end the
remaining 21 tons were exploded by
concussion. The holes had not been
connected electrically, as the dis
charge of the blast was set for 5
o'clock in the afternoon. The last
hole was being loaded under the
supervision of one of the most effici
ent powder men in the employ of the
commission.

SLUGGERS
uW
GLEAN GET AWAY
THE POSTOFFICE AT SAULT STE.
MARIE ROBBED BY THREE
THUGS.
DEPUTY SANDBAGGED
Was Making Up Pay Envelopes When
The Thieves Entered Inquiring for
Mail.
Twenty-five hundred dollars was
taken from the Sault Ste. Marie post
office Sunday night by three unknown
men, who committetd one of the most
daring crimes in the history of the
upper peninsula.
Frank HIgglns, deputy postmaster,
was placing money iu the pay enve
lopes about 8:0 when the three men
entered, knocked him unconscious and
escaped with the money.
Higglns is now in the hospital and
the country is being scoured by of
ficers. The Canadian officers are work
ing on the case with those of the
American Soo.
Higglns was alone in the postofflce
when the two men knocked at his of
fice door.
"My name Is Robinson," said the
taller of the two, "and I would like to
get my mail now. if you don't mind,
because I am to leave town early in
the morning, before the postoffice will
be open."
Illggins turned toward his desk and
one of the men struck him heavily
over the head with a sandbag.
Rushing to the desk, the men swept
off all the money and walked out
quietly.
Higglns lay several hours in a pool
of blood and finally gained strength
enough to crawl from the building. He
told the authorities at first he had
been stabbed In the back.
The robbery was not discovered till
nearly midnight. Patrolman Charles
Roberts saw the men leave the door
on the Portage avenue side of the
building, but thousht they were from
the Sault club, which is located on the
third floor. The burglars turned the
corner at Portage avenue and went
east, toward the ferry, probably going
over Into Canada.
Higglns was seen by Roberts to
collapse on the sidewalk. When he
wfnt to his assistance Higglns said:
"They hit me." He was then taken to
a hospital. Later he revived enough
to tell the story of the robbery.
Postmaster Scott was Immediately
notified of the robbery. He thinks it
strange the men knew Higglns was
making out his pay roll at that hour.
Mr. Loud and the Filipinos.
Rep. Ixud, of Michigan, wants to be
transferred from the house commit
tee on education to the committee on
insular affairs. It is probable that it
Mr. Cannon can see his way clear the
Au Sable man will get what he wants.
Mr. Loud believes that this govern
ment Is not doing all it should for the
little brown brother. The Filipino Is
now taxed for the support of his
schools, but .Mr. Loud points out that
a great many' children under a certain
age. have been compelled to stop going
to school because there Is not money
enough to go around. The Michigan
man thinks this government can afford
to spend some money of its own In
order to give all the children a chance
to learn.
When the Governor Will Talk.
"What have I to say about the con
dition of the state treasury and the
causes for its depletion I shall say In

INVALID'S SAD PLIGHT.
After Inflammatory Rheumatism, Hair
Came Out, Skin Peeled, and Bed
Sores Developed Only Cuti
cura Proved Successful.
"About four years ago I had a very
severe attack of inflammatory rh.euma
tlsm. My skin peeled, and the high
fever played havoc with my hair,
which came out in bunches. I also
had three large bed sores on my back.
I did not gain very rapidly, and my
appetite was very poor. I tried many
'sure cures' but they were of little
help, end until I tried Cuticura Re
solvent I had had no real relief. Then
my complexion cleared and soon I felt
better. The bed sores went very soon
after a few applications of Cuticura
Ointment, and when I used Cuti
cura Soap and Ointment for ray hair
it began to regain its former glossy ap
pearance. Mrs. Lavina J. Henderson,
