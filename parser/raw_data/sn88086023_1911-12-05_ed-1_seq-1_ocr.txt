LIFE SENTENCE FDR J. B. M'HAMARA.
OF 21: 15
Judge Denounces Brothers Who Lose Bravado U.
Government Becomes Active James Writes
Confession Election Effected
Los Angeles, Calif.. Dec. 5. James
B. McNamara was given a life sen
tence In San Quentln prison this mor
ning by Judge Bordwell, who first de
nounced him as a murderer at heart
and declaring that there were no ex
tenuating circumstances In the case.
John J. McNamara, his brother was
given a sentence of fifteen years in
San Quentln.
John McNamara, secretary-treasurer
of the International Association of
tho International Association of
Bridge and Structural Iron Workers,
was also bitterly denounced by Dis
trict Attorney Fredericks and Judge
Bordwell.
At the last minute Judge Bordwell
announced that he would sentence the
McNamaras In Judge McCormlck'a
court room. In the Hall of Justice
buid'ng instead of in aid own court In
the Hall of Records.
At 10:15 o'clock Judge Bordwell ar
rived and took his seat. At 10:20 the
McNamaras brothers, handcuffed to
the sheriff and his assistant, entered
and took a position at the district at
torney's table.
Short'y after 10:30 o'clock Jim was
sentenced, after District Attorney
Fredericks made a plea for a life sen
tence. "The bargain was kept. The prom
ises made by counsel for tho McNa
maras and "b'g business" men, who
wanted the cases disposed of prior to
the municipal election were fulfilled
by Judgo Bordwell, for this reason," It
was charged by unionists when Jas.
McNamara, murderer of twenty-one
persons got only a life sentence.
All bravado was gone when the
murderer faced the judge. Judge
Bordwell sa'd that James deserved to
dlo on the gallows, but the recom
mendation of the prosecution saved
him.
James almost collapsed when ha sat
down. When John J. stood up his
eyes were sunken and he showed
signs of deep worry.
Judge Bordwell said he was fully
as guilty as his brother. Then the
men were hurried back to Jail.
After ho returned to Jnll Jim asked
that a telegram be tent to his mother,
which Darrow promised to do. v
Every man who has entered Judge
Bordwell's court this morn'ng was
thoroughly searched by Detective
Brown and a picked force of men. He
saij he had received Information that
an attempt might bo made to shoot
the McNamaras while they were be
ing sentenced.
, Tho McNamaras slept fairly well
last night, and although they were
extremely nervous before being taken
to tho court hou-e, they said they
wero willing to "take their medi
cine." They said thnt If they got prison
sentences, they would both work for
a parole, for which they will become
eligible In seven years.
There is much bitterness against
the prisoners among the laboring men
of th's city who declare that tho Mc
Namaras betrayed men who trusted
them Impl'clty,
During last night Sheriff Hammel
had a special force of guards patrol
Ing the Jnll yard and extra precau
tions were tnken to make suro that
no untoward event could happen.
After returning to his office Dis
trict Attorney Fredericks said:
"Some labor leaders who nro de
nouncing the McNamnras, aro abso-
luto'y ns guilty as they and I know
they nre Implicated In dynamiting
outrnges.
"I know ns much about them as

nectod with the Times or other dy

"What the fedeial authorities' will

He said the bribery charges will

effort is being made o have the whole
affair dropped.
Sheriff Hammel Is undecided when
to take the two prisoners to San

guard accompanying him, as they
must be taken through San Francisco

There was no opposition for places on
the council.
Tho contest between Messrs. Van
Vactor and Farnsworth was largely
personal and no part;cular issues were
at stake. Van Vactor Is district at

counties but inasmuch as the position
of mayor of Heppner pays no salar;.
he may hold both offices without con

Majority
FOR WATER COMM.
Third and Fourth Wards,
w. F. MATLOCK
; LEE MOORHOTISR
dieted, the majority of 71 9howing
the. narrowness of the victorious mar
gin. In two wards the younger can
didate secured a small majority but
the lead secured by Matlock In the
fourth and third was decisive. The
fourth went heaviest for him, giving
him a majority of 42 while the third
was but a few behind in its prefer
ential expression.
CoiiimirT-lon Plan Loses.
The fight for the adoption or re
jection of the commission form of
government was even more close than
that over the mayoralty, the results
showing that there was almost a vote
for to every one against the plan. In
the fourth ward, the heaviest, such
a phenomenon actually presented It
self, there being exactly 152 votes for
and against the initiative measure.
The first ward gave the heaviest ma
jority against the plan, 23 votes, while
it lost three In the second and 11 in
the third.
The .victory of Will Moore over
James Johns was the on'y sweeping
one of the election, his majority being
209. This is taken as evidence of the
popularity of the methods to secure
gravity water which the majority
commissioners adopted and will now
carry out.
nig Vote Polled.
Fully 200 more votes were polled
yesterday than anticipated, the total
number lacking but about 15 of reach
ing the 1100 mark. There were but
536 names on the registration books
and it is estimated that not more
than 450 of these voted. However,
active lieutenants of both mayoralty
candidates were in the field and men
were sworn In by the score. Both
candidates had challengers In each
booth, although an error in the report
In this paper yesterday made It ap
pear that only the Matlock men were
protes'lng votes.
Thousands of dollars changed
han.ls last night and this mornine as
a result of the election and there arc
many rueful countenances in the
ranks of the losers. Nearly all of tho
money was wagered on the outcome
of the mayoralty race and the returns
were watched with more than usual
