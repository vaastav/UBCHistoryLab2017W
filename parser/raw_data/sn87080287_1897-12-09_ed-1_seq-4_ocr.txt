Savings oi* the Poor.
One of the principal reasons put forth
in opposition to the establishment of
postal savings banks is that the govern
ment ought not to interfere in any way
with the business of private bankers
;by taking for Eafe-kecping deposits
which they might like to handle. Op-
I posed to the general principle laid down I
by the opponents of postal savings
banks as the basis of their opposition is
, another principle which the Chicago
Record believes is more pertinent to the
! particular subject under consideration.
It is that private individuals ought not
to be allowed to make a profit from
handling the small savings of the poor.
This principle is one that is recognized
; not only in most civilized countries
abroad, but also in those parts of the
; United States where wealth is most
! abundant and where provisions for the l
protection of property of all kinds are
most highly developed. In the New
England states and New York, the only
portion of this country at all adequately
-upplied with savings bank facilities,
bankers are not allowed, as in Illinois.
:o regard the small savings of the poor
as funds to be invested for their own
private enrichment. The savings banks
i of those states are mutual institutions,
j managed by trustees who serve with
out compensation aud who derive nr.
i profit from the loaning of the funds in-
I trusted to their care. No other kind of
I savings bank is permitted by law. The ,
j savings of the poor are held so sacred
j that it is deemed unwise to allow bank
I ers to use them for private profit fo;
! fear the tendency to speculate with the
funds and invest them in questionable
j securities because these pay high rates
! "f interest might result in loss and
j hardship to a class that it should be
I especially the object of society to pro
| tect. If we are not to have postal
, banks, then the states of the west and
I south should imitate the example of
New England and New York and make
provision for mutual savings institu
tions for the accommodation and safe
ty of the small depositors. The principle
should be recognized in practice the
country over, as it is in the extreme,
eastern states and in Europe, that the
small savings of the poor should not be :
used for the profit of those to whose
j care they may be intrusted. Hut i:
I this principle is to be carried out, there
will be much less reason why the gov
j eminent should not itself directly care
j for those small savings, for then the
I undertaking of this work would not be
I held to be interference with the profit- |
j making purposes of private bankers. 1
| A venerable Schenectady woman was
i confronted the other day 1 the specter
| of her returning husband, whohad'lef.
I her -18 years before to go to California
and grow up with the country. She
had heard from him for a few years,
and then, all letters ceasing, she reached
the natural conclusion that he was
dead, and married again. Her second
■ husband died in due time, and she was
left in the weeds of her double widow
hood till the return of her original
spouse, who came back dead broke at
81, having entirely failed to grow up
with the country to which lie emigrated.
The interest of his home-coming, re
marks the New York Tribune, is thus
reduced to extremely slender propor
tions and the Schenectady novelist who
makes a romance of it will have to get
up early in the morning.

ARMORED PLANTS.
Protected from Their Eneiiiiea foj
Thorn* and Prickles.
"Plants and Their Enemies" is the ti
tle of an article by Thomas H. Kearney.
Jr., in St. Nicholas. Mr. Kearney says:
There are a thousand things that
threaten the well-being, and even the
life of every tree and shrub and lowly
herb. Too much heat, too little,
work great harm to plants. Then there
are all manner of wasting diseases
caused by other tiny plants called fungi
and bacteria. Many large animals, a. 1 -
horses and cows and sheep, live by graz
ing the herbage and grass, or brows
iug the foliage of trees and shrubs. Ol

They Are Protected.)
course they greatly Injure the plants
they feed upon, and therefore many
plants are in one way or another pro
tected against such attacks.
Did you ever stop to think why this
tles are so well-armed with sharp
prickles, or why the ugly roudsidc net
tles are furnished with stinging hairs?
Notice cattle grazing in a field where
thistles or nettles grow; see how care
ful they are to let those disagreeable
plants alone. That is the reason for
the stings and the spines. See this
honey-locust tree bristling with its hor
rid array of three-pointed thorns?
What animal is brave enough to try to
rob it of its leaves or great pods? Ilaw
thorns, too, and rosebushes, and black
berry briars, all have their sharp little
swords and daggers to defend them
selves against browsing animals.
Out on the wide hot deserts of Ari
zona and New Mexico those odd plants,
the eaeti, grow in great numbers. Some
oi them take strange shapes—tall, fluted
columns, branching candelabra, or mere
round balls, like the melon-cactus.
They are almost the only plants that
grow in some parts of that country,
and there is always plenty of sap in
side their tough skins. To the hungry
and thirsty creatures that roam those
dieary wastes in search of food and
water they are very tempting. Were
they not in some way protected these
eaeti would soon be entirely destroyed.
But nature has made them to be like
strong forts or great armored battle
ships among plants. They are guard
ed by all sorts of sharp spines and
prickles and line hairs that burn when
they get into the flesh.
MOUNTED ON A COW.
Hon a French Marquis Surprised His
Friend* and the Public.
Suzanne is the name of the (irst cow
that probably has ever been saddled
and bridled and ridden like a horse.
Her history is most unusually interest
ing.
Some time ago a number of gentle
men residing in and about Bordeaux,
interested in horses, formed themselves

who, remembering the ability with
which bulls frequently leap over
formidable barriers, declared, when
naked what form his contribu

take, that he would ride a cow.
The sportsman, after some inquiry,
lighted on Suzanne, which is described
as being of much higher intellectual

!\'o More Slaughter In War.
A great humanitarian exists in the
person of Simon Pavlowski, a poor Pol
ish chemist of Warsaw. He has invent
ed a gas which is forced into a shell
made of gelatin. This gas is a powerful
anesthetic. If the shells are used in
the wars of the future there need he
no more deaths or mutilations on the
battlefield. When the shells burst in
the ranks of the foe the freed gas will
permeate the atmosphere and lull the
enemy into 15 hours' sleep. Then
standards, ammunitions, and. if desir
able. their sleeping bodies may be re
moved before they awaken.
