A Scientific Victory.
From Longman'* Magazine.
It is interesting to note the wondrous
chan that has taken place, in the pop­
ular* estimate of the Darwinian theory.
It has been well said that a new theory
has often to run through three different
phases. In the first place, every one
exclaims that the theory is not tiue
then it is urged that the theory is con­
trary to religion and, lastly, that every­
body knew it long ago. The great doc­
trine of datu al selection promulgated
by Darwin has run through these
courses. At its publication it was re­
ceived with an outburst of incredulity
among the unthinking part of the com­
munity. Every one recollects the de­
nunciations it received and the ridicule
which the new doctrine h?.d to encoun­
ter. But the theory of Da win has sur­
vived that stage. It has also survived
the attacks ot those who denounce'the
theory as contrary to religion. The
truth inherent in the principles of Dar­
win has quietly brushed aside such op­
position, and now we hear but little of
it. The funeral of Darwin at Westmin­
ster Abbey must be regarded as mark­
ing a momentous epoch in the history
of" thought. That the great doctrine
would one dav be accepted was a nec­
essary truth, but I do not think that
any one who recollects the publication
of the ''Origin of Species" could then
hqve anticipated the enormous change
in educated opinion which the next
quarter of a century was to disclose.
Still Jess likely would it have seemed
that the whole nation would have so
far acknowleeged Darwin that with one
accord they demanded that his remains
should be interred in the national mau­
soleum.
The Princess Beatrice is the favorite
child of Queen Victoria, and many say
that she is, in fact, the real Queen of
England, as her mother delegates a great
deal of authority to her.
ABOUT THE STOMACH.
We dare say three-fourths ol the diseases
that prevail ia the human family are directly
or indirectly induced by some derangement
of the stomach. The most serious ailments
have their origin there. With dyspepsia the
food passes indigested through the lacteal
vessels and many particles of deleterons mat­
ter are carried into the blood and gain lodg­
ment often in the lungs and other-great cen­
ters of vitality. Hence dyspepsia favors the
occurrence of consumption in persons at all
predisposed to it. I„ is also the primary
source of scrofula and other diseases of the
blood and skin.
The person who has a pig-pen appetite one
day and can eat little or nothing the next has
dyspepsia. The person who feels a heaviness
at the stomach after eating, accompanied
with a gulping-up of wind and sour particles
of food, has dyspepsia. Besides these symp­
toms are bad taste in the mouth, pain in the
chest, shortness ot breath, palpitation, head­
ache, giddiness, coldness of extremities, lan­
guor, sleeplessness and despondency.
In prescribing Burdock Blood Bitters as a
cure fer dyspepsia we desire the patient to eat
regularly a reasonable quantity of good,plain
food (aot too hot or too cold) and to use very
sparingly of tobacco (if addictei to that hab­
it,,) which is apt to exhaust the organs of sal­
ivation. Dyspepsia is a disease of the mucous
membrane lining the stomach. If the patient
will treat this mucous membrane of the stom­
ach with any sort of decency, ceasing to ag­
gravate its sensitive surface with indigestible
matter, we guarantee the use of Burdock
Blood Bitters will cure him. That's all we
ask. Give the stomach a fair chance, Bur­
dock Blood Bitters will do the rest. Thous­

The reason why so many die with con­
sumption, is because they neglect to use the

My Wife ana Children.
Rev. L. A. Dunlan, of Mt. Vernon, says:
My children were afflicted with a cough re­
sulting from Measeles, my wife with a cough
that had prevented her from sleeping more
or less for years, and year White Wine ol
Tar Syrup has eared them all,

Rev. L. S. Cauitan, of Circleviile, Kansas,
says: Dr. Warner, your White Wine of Tar
Syrup has been in my family and found to
be all and even more than yon claim of It.
It is a speedy cure for all Throat and Lung
diseases.

is but one avenue of escape from their af­

more efficacious than ever and is faultless.

THE MAKVBIXOUS SINGING DOIX.
This charming novelty is advertised in this
issue, and certainly nolhing will apneal more
qaickly to the children than a Doll that will sing a
song. The price is very reasonable, the Doll is a
beautiful affair, and the ingenious singitig attach­
ment will delight the young and amn»e the old.
The little girl who hods a Webber Doll "in hw
stocking" at Christmas time will bathe envy of all.
Dear Sir: The beautiful Singing Doll ca'me
sajely,andfar exceeded ray expectation of what
a Singing Doll could be. Our little folk were
charmed with its "beauty, but when -it sang,
their delight was„ unbounded. It xoiU bt to
them a thing of beauty and a constant joy.
Sincerely yours. Rev. J. B, ABBOTT.

-THAT WILL CURE—
Coughs, Colds, Croup,
Dr. Meredith, Dentist,
of Cincin'ti, was thought
to be in the last stages
of Consumption, and
WM indueed by his
friends to try Allen's
linng Balsam after the
formula was shown him.
We have his letter that
it at onoe cured his cough
and that he wa3 able to
reaunju his practice.
Wm. C. Dirges, Mer­
chant, of Bo*
ling Green,
Va., writes April
4,1881',
that he wants ns to know
that the Lung Balsam
has oured his mother
of Consumption, after
the physician had given
her op as incurable. He
says others knowing her
ease have taken the Bal­
sam and been oared. He
thinks all so clBioted
should give it a trial.
