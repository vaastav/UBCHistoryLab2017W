2 Nation
Is One of Great Strides asj
Shown by Secretary's
Annual Report.
WASHINGTON". H. C.. Deo. " 14?
After twelve yean* of service as head
of the department, the secretary of
agriculture in his twelfth annual roport
to the President. Issued today,
renders a comprehensive account of
his stewardship .and presents a review
of the progress of agriculture
in the United. States during that
period. ? Concerning the farm production
of 1908, he says that the
farmer has created wealth by the billions.
Production has been above
the average of recent years with few
exceptions: and, while some prices
have fallen, others have risen.
The farm value of all farm products
of 1D0S reaches the most extraordinary
total In the nation's history?g
7,7 7 8,0 00,000. The farmer
contributes 87 per cent, of the raw
material used in those InanufacturIng
industries which depend mostly
or considerably upon agricultural
materials.
The gain in value of farm products
in 010 8 over 1007 Is $1:90.000.000
and would have been much larger
hud not the prices of cotton and hay
been low.
Greatest of all crojjs is Indian
corn, whoso production this year is
2,642,000.000 bushels. The value of
this crop 1? $1,615,000,000. Compared
wltli the average of the preceding
five years the quantity is 2 per cent,
higher and the value 43 per cent,
higher.
It seems likely that the cotton')
crop is one of the highest three ever)
l>roauceu. out wicn a. vaiuc next toi
Uio highest or perhaps more. a!-1
thougli the farm price of cotton thisi;
year is below the price of lust year J;
by more than one cent. For the firat, i
tlrm; in tho history of thin country's;;
agriculture, tho value of t:h? cotton ||
crop, including seed, has apparently ;
exceeded the value of the hay crop. 11
which has heretofore hold second J (
place. J i
The greatest hay crop in "history j
hai hcen gathered this year. 6S,-j
000,000 tons, or 12 per cent, above!
the average of the preceding five !
years. Its price is $2 per ton less!
than It was a year ago, but still the}
farm value of the crop is 5021,000.- j
300. or 6 per cent, above the five!
rear average.
Wheat is one and one-half per J
aent above the five-year average in j
production and 2 3 per cent, above in!
otal value. The 660.000.000 bushels;
jf this crop arc estimated to be J
vorth $620,000,000 to tho farmers, j J
ar 66,000,000 piore than the mosti
valuable wheat crop heretofore pro-1
luced.
Although the oat crop suffered'
rrom drought the value is $321,000.-1
>00 for 780,000,000 bushels, or ten j.
>er cent, above the five-year aver-'
igo value and 0 per cent, below tho ?
Lverage product.
All cereals aggregate 4,1520,000,000 ^
mgliels. a total that lias been ex- ,
:eed?d three times, but tlm value
reaches $2,694,000,000. or more than j*
$300,000,000 above that of 1007. an?Jj?
jxcucdts still more the totals of for- "
mer years. Compared with the pro- '
ceding flvo years, the number of
bu*hels Is higher by O.'J per cent a
ind the value Is higher by 32 per '
rent. J1
For the first time, tills year, th
rulue of all fnrm crops equals $&.- H
)00,000.000. and of this total the vat I- h
.ie of the corn crop Is about one- J1
ihlrd: wheat, hay and cotton comjlned
make more than another third,
tnd the smaller crop s the remain- J
Jcr, or nearly one-third. Never bo-'
tore lias the hay croii been so large!
n quantity, nor the rice crop, nor v
lie sugar beet crop, nor beet and {:
:ano sugar production. Tho pro-;*
luetlon of barley hits been exceeded)J1
n only one former year, and cotton |.
by only two years at the most.

that I place the report before '
you. It appearB that almost all tfio
memlters or Company B must have
been actively concerned in the shoot- 1
lng, either to the extent of being partlclpanti
or to'the extent of virtually
encouraging those who were participants.
As to Companies C and D,
there can be no question that practically
every man In them must have
had knowledge that the shooting was |
done by some of the soldiers of B :
Troop, and possibly by one or two '
otbcrs in one of the other troops. _
This concealment was itself a grave
ofTense. which was greatly aggravated
by their testifying before the Senate
committee that they were Ignorant
of what they must have known.
Nevertheless. It is to'be said in par- *
tlal extenuation that they were probably
cowed by threats, made by the
more desperate of the men wbp had
actually been engaged In the (booting.
as to what wonld happen 'to any
man who failed to protect the wroitg- -.2
iloers. Moreover. there are clrcum- ..
stances tending to show tliat these
misguided men were encouraged by
outsiders to persist In tbelr coarse
of concealment and denial. I feel,
therefore, that the guilt of the men %
who, after the event, thus shielded
ho perpetrators of the wrong by re- |
ruslng to tell the truth a!bou( them,
though serious, was In part due to
he unwise and .Improper attitude of
others, aud that some moasure of alowanco
should bo made for tho "mis- '
:onduct. In other words. I believe
ire can afford to reinstate aoy of
hese men who now truthfully bell
what has happened, give all tho aid .... :
