TUESDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1879.
Chief Just ice Waite is reported to be at the
point of death, though there are some slight
hopes of his recovery.
Many railway employés have been arrested
at Moscow on suspicion of complicity in the
plot to assassinate the Czar.
A dispatch from Alexandria, states that the
embarkation of the obelisk presented by
Egypt to the United States will take place in
a few days.
The last attempt to assassinate the Czar has
thoroughly frightened that despotic potentate,
and it is likely hereafter that he will be very
careful in making railroad excursions.
Congressman Bingham yesterday introduced
iu the House, a joint resolution providing for
an equestrian statue to the late General Custer
which it is estimated will cost $30,000. It
will bo. erected on some suitable reservation
^ irtb the capital.
Apostle-Delegate Cannon is full of virtuous
indignation at President Hayes for the latter's
outspoken views on the polygamy question.
Cannon vehemently claims that the Mormons
have in no way instigated or encouraged the
recent Ute outbreak, but from this very fact
their complicity is fully established, for Can
non is, perhaps, the most accomplished falsi
fier in the universe.
Miss Amy Hostetter, daughter of the dealer
in the bitters which bear his name, was mar
eied in Pittsburg, Pa., recently, to Mr. Her
bert Dupuv, of Philadelphia. The presents
from the bride's father alone were worth
more than $100,000, and he is said to have
given her besides, as a marriage portion,
$1,000,000 in United States bonds. Thus is
the married existence sometimes sweetened
with bitterness.
There seems to be a general desire on the
part of the leaders of both parties in the pres
ent Congress to leave the financial question
severely alone. They seem to undeistand
that the people are satisfied with the money in
present circulation, and that however many
" improved measures " they could bring up,
the result of making their schemes public
would be the instant loss of their popularity.
It is deemed wise therefore to let well enough
alone, as further experiments would be dan
gerous to our prosperity.
From the fact that we hear no more con
eerning the stupendous Democratic fraud in
Ma'ne, it is presumable that the great Repub
lican outcry was indulged in for moral effect.
It is necessary in order to preserve a solid
North that great Democratic frauds shall be
periodically unearthed, just as it is necessary
for the pieservation of a solid South that Re
publican corruption shall be discovered.

are based on notorious facts anil that the

In his charge to the Grand Jury on the
opening of the District Court, last Monday,
Judge Galbraith took strong grounds against
the organization of vigilance committees.
His Honor admitted the usnsual prevalence
of crime in this Territory and district, but
deprecated in emphatic language a
resort to lynch law and wliat he was
pleased to designate mob violence, which
terms he eveidently considers synonymous.
His honor said : '-The experience of ages
has demonstrated that the strict administration
of the statutory laws, and a due support to
the constituted authorities, is the most effica
cious, as well jis the only proper, means for
the prevention of crime, whether in enforcing
or defending the true interests of society."
ASELIISH CONGRESSMAN.
The bill just introduced in Congress by
Belford for the removal of the Utes provides
that all laws establishing a reservation for the
Utes in Colorado shall be repealed and that
lands constituting such reservation shall be
come public domain. It further provides that
the President, with the consent of the Senate,
shall appoint five commissioners to select in
some one of the Territories, a reservation for
the Utes and arrange with them for a peaceful
removal. The bill proposes an appropriation
of $200,000 to meet the expenses of removal.
Representative Belford may be an able pol
itician, and is, perhaps, very desirous of pro
moting the interests of his constituents, but
the above extract from our dispatches of Wed
nesday proves that he is narrow minded, sel
fish and dishonorable. The mere fact that a
man is elected to Congress from one State
does not justify him in endeavoring to secure
legislation inimical to the interest of any other
section of the country. No statesman will
consider that he performs his duty simply by
attending to the private wants of his few con
stituents. No patriotic Congressman will
regard the particular district in which he
happens to be elected as the only part of the
country possessing a claim on his time and
ability.
If a representative from California were to
bring up a bill providing for the removal of
the Chinese to Colorado, the gentleman from
the Centennial State would be very apt to
characterize the proposed measure as a grossly
unfair and villainous imposition, and would
in all probability stigmatize lbe proposer as a
senseless and corrupt political demagogue,
whose sole aim was to make money by engi
neering disreputable jobs through Congress.
It may be urged that in using the words "one
of Lhe Territories," he Intended more partic
ular reference fo Indian Territory, to which
we contend all the aborigines in the West
should be removed, bat if "iat was the idea
of the gentleman wby was it not so expressed?
The presence of the Utes in Colorado Is a
great drawback to civilization. They o.cupy
perhaps, the best mineral and agricultural
land in that State, and their removal there
flom is sincerely to be desired provided they
can be placed where they will not retard pro
gress to an erual extent in some other State
or Territory. This proviso, however, does
not enter into the calculations of Mr. Belford.
As long as the Utes are removed from Colo
rado, he cares not what other section of the
country they afflict, and doubtless thinks that
Idaho or Montaua, being far from his little
world in Colorado, would be a most desirable
place for the establishment of the new reser
vation.

THE RENO TRIAL.
The tenor of the dispatches from Fort
Meade, renders it quite evident that the in
vestigation now being conducted by the court
martial in relation to the very serious charg
es preferred against Major Reno, will result in
the acquittal of that officer. The preponder
ance of testimony in his behalf seems to be
based on the fact that the prisoner is not the
only officer of the post who gets drank, boist
erous and warlike. Other military gentle
men of Fort Meade, it appears, have been on
many occasions fully as much intoxicated as
was Major Reno. The testimony elicited
shows that gambling, drinking and other
vices are very common at the officers' quarters,
and to punish Reno for indiscrétions of which
many of his brother officers are occasionally,
if not frequently guilty, would be so mani
festly unjust that his dismissal from service,
which it was generally thought would be his
seuteuce, is not likely to be recommended by
the court.
However, the investigation has already had
<gie good effect. It has opened the eyes of
Congress to the fact as brought out in the
testimony that the young officers of the army,
the men on whose nerve, endurance and
brains the country would he dependent in
case of war, are weakening their bodies, ruin
ing their morals and destroying their intel
lects by midnight carouses, excessive drink
ing and indulgence in a dozen other forms of
enervating dissipation. Accordingly, on the
4th instant, Senator Plumb, of Kansas, in
troduced a bill in Congress providing for an
additional article of war which shall prohibit
all gambling by the officers ami soldiers of
the regular army. There is little doubt that
the measure will receive favorable action at
the hands of the national law makers.
HOW TO MINE.
Some Important Lawn Affecting: tine Oc
currence and tile Richness of Metal
llferons Teins.
X. Y. Mining Record.
1. Metalliferous reins occur mostly in dis
turbedand highly-metamorphic regions, where
the strata are tilted, and followed, and meta
morphosed. The tilting and folding are nec
essary to the formation of fissures ; and the
conditions under which metamorphism takes
place seem necessary for the subsequent
filling with mineral matter. Mineral veins,
therefore, occur mostly in mountain regions,
and in the vicinity of more or less obvious
evidence of igneous ageucy. Dead veins
seem_to be an exception to this rule. They
ad in undisturbed regions, where
_J entirely unchanged. The rich
i of Illinois, Iowa and Missouri are
nGabl.. examples, the country rock being
horizontal, fossilifcrous limestone of the Pal
aeozoic era.
2. Metall irerous veins occur mostly in the
older rocks. In Great Britain, for example,
no profitable veins occur above the Trias.
This rule, which was regarded as one of
great importance by the older geologists, is
not so regarded now. There seems to be no
close connection between the occurrence of
metalliferous veins and simple age alone ; the
connection is rather with metamorphism.
Metamorphism is most common in older
rocks, and becomes more and more excep
tional as we pass upward. The occurrence
of metallilerous veins follows the same law.
But when the newer rocks are metamorphic,
they are as likely to contain veins as are rocks
of the older series. The metalliferous veins
of California occur in Jurassic, Cretaceous,
aud even Tertiary strata ; but these strata are
there highly metamorphic, and strongly
folded. In Bohemia, also, and elsewhere,
metalliferous veins occur iu the higher series.
(Phillips 10,549).
3. Parallel veins are apt to have similar
metalic contents, while veins running in dif
ferent directions (unless at right angles), are
apt to contain different metalic contents. *
* * The auriferous veins of California are
parallel to each other and to the Sierras, ex
cept a few smaller ones, which are at right
angles to these. The reason of tills rale is,
that parallel fissures belong to the same sys
tem, and were therefore formed at the
same time, broke through the same strata,
and were filled under similar conditions, and,
tbefore, with the same materials ; while fis
sures running in difierent directions, unless
in some cases at right angles, were probably
formed at different times, broke through dif
ferent strata, and were filled under different
conditions. Thus, the east and west veins of
Cornwall break only through the Trias, while
the north and south veins break through the
Cretaceous. The auriferous veins of Califor
nia ail break through the Jurassic; they, or
their fissures, were all produced at the same
time, viz: at the time oi the pushing up of the
Sierras.
4. A change of country rock of outcropping
veins is apt to determine some cliange, either
in the contents or in the richness of the vein.
Nevertheless, there is not that close connec
tion between the nature of the country rock
and the vein contents which obtains in infil
trative veins. The reason is, that infiltrative
veins derive their conteuts entirely from the
wall rock on either side, while fissure veins
derive their contents from all the strata
through which they break, even to great
depths, and especially from the deeper strata.
The nature of the surface or country rock is,
therefore, only one factor determining the
vein contents.
5. Metallic veins are usually richer near
their points of intersection with granite or
with an igneous dyke, especially if the strata !
have suffered metamorphism. This shows
the influence of such heat as is present in
metamorphism, in determining the metallic
contents.
0. If two veins cross each other, especially
if at small angles, one or both are apt to be
richer at the point of crossing. No sufficient
reason has been given for this law. It is
probably due to the reaction of water bearing
difierent materials circulating in the two fis
sures.
7. Since the veins are the filling of fissures,
they are often slipped by each other or by
dykes by simple unfilled fissures. If a metal
liferous vein is thus slipped, according to the
law of slips the footwall of the vein has usu
ally gone upward, and the hanging wall
dropped downward. The great importance
of this law iupiactical mining is sufficiently
obvious.
Extracts from the President's
Message.
Fellow citizens of the Smote and House of
Bepresentativcs :
The members of the Forty-sixth Congress
have assembled in their first regular session
under circumstances calling for mutual con
gratulations and grateful acknowledgment to
the Giver of all good for the large and un
usual measure of national prosperity which
we now enjoy. The most interesting events
which have occurred in our public affaire
since my last annual message to Congress are
connected with the financial operations of the
government, directly affecting the business
interests of the country. I congratulate
Congress on the successful execution of the
Resumption act.
The increasing foreign demand for our
manufactures and agricultural products has
caused a large balance of trade in our favor,
which has been paid in gold from the first of
July last to November 15th, to the amount of
about $59,000,000. Since the resumption of
specie payments there lias beeil a marked and
gratifying improvement of the public credit.
The bonds ot the government, bearing only
four per cent, interest, have been sold at or.
above par, sufficient in amount to pay off all
of the national debt which was redeemable
under the present laws. The amount of
interest saved annually by the process of re
funding the debt since March 1st, 1877, is
$14,297,177. The bonds sold were largely in
small sums, and the number of our citizens
now holding the public securities is much
greater than ever before. The amount of
national debt which matures within less than
two years, is $792,121,700 of which $500,000,
000 bears interest at. the rate of five per
centum. It is believed that this part of the
public debt can be refunded by tlie issue of
four per cent, bonds and by the reduction of
interest which will thus be effected, about
$11,000,000 can be atiuually saved to the
Treasury. To secure ibis important reduc
tion of interest to be paid by the United
States, further legislation is required, which
it is hoped will be provided by Congress
during its present session.
COINAGE.
The coinage of gold by the mints of the
United Slates during the last fiscal year was,
$40,986,922. The coinage of silver dollars
since the passage of the act for that purpose,
up to November 1st, 1879, was $45,000,850, of
which $12,700,344 have been issued from the
Treasury and are now in circulation, and
$32,400,500 aie still in the possession oi the
government.
CURRENCY.
The retirement l'rom circulation of United
States notes with the capacity of legal tender
in private contracts, is a step to be taken in
our progress toward a safe and stable currency
which should be accepted as the policy and
duty of the government, and the interest and
security of the people. It is my firm convic
tion that the issue of legal tender paper
money, based wholly upon the authority and
credit of the government, except in extreme
urgency, is without warrant in the Constitu
tion and a violation of sound financial princi
ples. The issue of United States notes during
the late civil, war, with the capacity ot legal
tender, between private individuals, was not
authorized except as a means of rescuing the
country from imminent peril.
T1IE SUPPRESSION OP POLYGAMY.
The continued deliberate violation by a
large number of the prominent and influen
tial citizens of the Territory of Utah of the
laws of the United States for the prosecution
and punishment of polygamy, demands the at
tention of every department of the govern
ment. This Territory lias a population suffi
cient to entitle it to admission as a State.
This important change, will, however, never
be approved by the country, while the citi
zeusjof Uteh, in very considerable number,
uphold a practice which is condemned as a
crime by the laws of all civilized communi
ties throughout the world. The law for the
suppression of the offense was enacted with
great unanimity by Congress more than sev
enteen years ago, but lias remained until re
cently a dead letter in the Territory of Utah,
because of the peculiar difficulties attending
its enforcement.
It should be firmly and effectively executed.
If not sufficiently stringent iu its provisions,
it should be amended, aud, in aid of the pur
pose in view, I recommend that more compre
hensive and more searching methods for pre
venting, as well as punishing this crime, be
provided.
TUE ELECTIONS.
I earnestly appeal to the intelligence and
patriotism of all good citizens of every part of
the country, however much they may be di
vided in opinion on other political subjects, to
unite in compelling obedience to existing
laws aimed at the protection of the right of
suffrage. I respectfully urge upon Congress
to supply any defects in these laws which ex
perience has shown, and which it is in its
power to remedy. I again invoke 'lie co-op
eration of the executive and legislative au
thorities of the States in this great purpose.
1 am fully convinced that it the public mind
can be set at rest on this paramount question
of popular rights, no serious object will
thwart or delay the complete pacification of
the country, or retard the general diffusion of
prosperity.
CIVIL SERVICE.
Iu a former message I invited the attention
of Congress to the subject of tlie reformation
of the civil service of the Government and
expressed the intention of transmitting to
Congress, as early as practicable, a report on
the subject by the chairman of the Civil Ser
vice Commission, on the subject of compet
itive examinations. I think the economy, pu
rity aud efficiency of the public service would
be greatly promoted by their systematic in
troduction, whenever practicable, throughout
the entire civil service of the Gevernment,
together with ample provision for their gene
ral supervision, in order to secure consistency
and uniform justice. I am convinced that if
a just and definite test of merit is enforced
for admission to tlie public service, and in
making promotions, such abuses as removing
without good cause, and partisan and official
interference with the proper exercise of the
appointing power, will, in a large measure,
disappear. It may not be easy, and it may
never, perhaps, be necessary to define with
precision the proper limit of political action
on the part of Federal officers. But while
their right to hold and freely express their
opinions cannot be questioned, it is very plain
that they should neither be allowed to ejevote
to other subjects the time needed for the
! proper discharge of their official duties, nor
to use the authority of their office to enforce
their own opinions, and to coerce the political
action of these who hold different opinions.
Reasons of justice and public policy quite
analagous to those which forbid the ase of po
litical power for the oppression of the private
citizeu impose upon the Government the duty
of protecting its officers and agents from arbi
trary exactions. In whatever aspect consid
ered, the practice of making levies for party
purposes upon salaries of officers is highly de
moralizing to Ute public service and discred
itable to the country. Though an officer
should be as free as any other citizen to give
his own money in aid of his own opinions or
his party, he should also be as free as any
other citizen to refuse to make such gifts.
OUR RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES
Have continued peaceful. With Great Brit
ain there are still unsettled questions grow
ing ont of the local laws of (he maritime
provinces, and the action of provincial au
thorities deemed to be in derogation of rights
secured to American fishermen. The United
Scales Minister in London has been Instructed
to present a demand for $105,305.02 in view
of the damages received by American citizens
of Fortuna Bay on the 6tli day of January,
1878 .
THE CUBAN QUESTION.
Questions of grave importance wi'h Spain,
growing out of the incidents of the Cuban in
surrection, have been for tlie most part hap
pilv and honorably settled.
THE CHINESE QUESTION.
The Government of China has signified its
willingness to consider the question of the
emigration of its subjects to the United States
with a dispassionate fairness, and to co-oper
ate in such measures as may tend to prevent
injurious consequences to tlie United Stales.
The negotiations are still proceeding, and will
be pushed with diligence.
THE INTER-OCEANIC CANAL
Has recently assumed a new and important
aspect, and is now under discussion with the
Central American countries through whose
territories the canal by the Nicaraguan route
would have to pass. It is trusted that enlight
ened statesmanship on their part will settle
the early prosecution of such woik, which
will largely inure to the benefit not only of
their own citizens and those of the United
States, but of the commerce of the civilized
world. It is not doubted that should tlie
work be undertaken under tlie protective au
spices of the United States, and upon satis
factory concessions- for tlie right of way, and
its security by the Central American govern
ments, the ^capital for its completion would
rapidly he furnished from this country and
Europe, which might, failing such guarantees,
prove iuaccessable.
THE ARMY AND NAVY.
The Secretary ot War reports that the War
Department estimates for tlie fiscal year elid
ing June 30,1881, are $40,380,428.93, the same
being for a less sum of money than tlie annual
estimate rendered to Congress from that de
partment during a period of at least twelve
years. He concurs with the General of the
army in recommending such legislation as
will authorize the enlistment of the full num
ber of 25,000 men required for detached duty
and therefore not available for service in the
field.
The report of the Secretary of tlie Navy
shows continued improvements In that branch
of the service during the last fiscal year. Ex
tensive repairs have been made upon vessels,
and two new ships have been completed anil
made ready for sea. Tlie total expenditures
for the year ending June 30, 1870, were $13,
555,710.09 ; the expenses chargeable to
tlie year were $13,343,315.79, but this is
subject to a reduction of $283,725.99, that
amount having been drawn upon warrants,
but not paid out during the year. The
amount of approptiation applicable to the last
fiscal year was $14,000,000 ; there was, there
fore, a balance of $1,479,054.37 remaining in
and to the credit of she Department on June
30, 1879.
THE BUSINESS OF THE SUPREME COURT

many ot the circuits, also,' tlie business litis
increased to such an extent that the delay of
justice will call the attention of Congress to
an appropriate remedy. It is believed that all
is done in such circuits which can fairly be
expected from its judicial force. The evils
arising from delay are loss heavily felt by the
United States than by private suitors, as its
causes are advanced by tlie courts when it is
seen they involve the decision of questions of
a public character. The remedy suggested
by the Attorney General is tlie appointment
of additional circuit judges, and the creation
of an intermediate Court of Errors aud Ap
peals, which shall release tlie Supreme Court
of a part of its jurisdiction, while a larger
force is also obtained for the performance of
circuit duties. I commend this suggestion to
the consideration of Congress. It would
seem to afford a complete remedy, and would
involve, if ten additional judges were appoint
ed, an expenditure at the present rate of sala
ries of not more than $6,000 a year, which
would certainly be small in comparison with
the objects to be attained.
TRANSFER OF THE INDIANS.
The question whether a change In the control
of the Indian service sliouid be made was, In
the Forty-fifth Congres,!', referred to a Joint com
In my last annual message, 1 expressed tlie nope
that the decision of that question then in pros
pect, would arrest further ugltalion of this euL
ject. such agitation being apt to produce a dis
turbing effect upon the service as well as the
Indians themselves. Since the committee hav
ing reported, the question has been decided in
the negative by a vote m the House of Repre
sentatives, for tlie reasons here stated ; and In
view of the fact that further uncertainty on this
point will be calculated to obstruct other much
needed legislation, to weaken the discipline of
tlie service and to unsettle salutary measures
now in progress for the government of the Indi
ans, I respectfully recommend that the decision
arrived ut by Congress, at its last session, be
permitted to stand.
TIMBER LANDS.
Interior to arrest the
lands of the United States have been continued
and have met with considerable success.
have been settled, the trespassers offering to
make payment to the Government for the value
of the timber taken by them. The proceeds of
these prosecutions and settlements turned into
the Treasury far exceed In amount the sums ap
propriated by Congress for the purpose. A more
important result, however, consists In the fact
that the destruction of our public forests by dep
redation, although such cases still occur, has
been greatly reduced In extent, and it Is prob
able that If the present policy is vigorously pur
sued and efficient provision to that end Is made
by
a It
pi
Congress, such trespasses, af least those on
arge scale, can be entirely suppressed, except
the Territories where timber for the daily
quireinont of tlie population cannot, under the
present state of law, be otherwise obtained.
AGRICULTURE.
My recommendations In former messages are
renewed, In favor of enlarging the facilities ot
the Department of Agriculture. Agriculture is
the leading Interest and the prominent industry
ot our people. It Is to the abundance of agri
cultural production as compared with our home
consumption, and the largely^ increased^ and
routable market abroad which we have
enjoyed in recent vears, that we are mainly In
debted for our présent prosperity as a people.
We must look for Its continued maintenance to
the same substantial resources. There is no
branch of industry In which labor directed by
ductlon in comparison with unskilled labor, and
no brandi of the public service to which the en
couragement of liberal appropriations can '
more appropriately extended. The omission
render such aid is not a wise economy; but on
the contrary, undoubtedly results tn losses of
immense sums annually that might be saved
through well directed efforts by the Government
to promote this vital interest,
The results al
ready accomplished with the very limited
means heretofore placed at the command of the
Department of Agriculture. Is an ernest of
what may be expected with increased appropri
ations for the several purposes Indicated In the
report {of the Commissioner. With a view to
placing the Department upon a footing whim
will enable tt to prosecute more effectively tlie
objects for which it Is established, appropria
tions are needed for a more complete laboratory

MINING SUMMARY.
REPORT ON THE
CZAROMA. HORNING STAR, TOM. HA
NET, GAGNON, AUGE. MOUNTAIN,
NETTIE, BURNETT, GRAT EOcK,
BELLE, CORA AND HIGH ORE HINES
-NOTES.
[By H. C. Olmstead, Mining Reporter.]
The Cnroms Mine
Is owned by George Farlin ; it is worked at
present by Messrs. Largey & Armstrong, who
have it bonded. The shalt is down 58 feet,
8 feet of which are used as a sump ; it is ver
tical, and was statred 40 feet north of the
croppings (which are very heavy on this
mine) with the intention of cutting the ledge
at a depth of about 65 feet ; the water, how
ever, becoming very troublesome, a station
was opened at the depth of 50 feet. Two
ledges were cut by the shaft, one near the
surface a foot wide, which has not yet been
prospected, and another 35 down about three
feet in width, which lias been opened and a
large quantity of free milling ore taken out
of it. ' .
On the 50 foot level a crosscut was run
north 35 feet; 17 fact from the shaft the
hanging wall was struck, tlie remaining 18
feet being run through a mass of ledge matter
ore and pink manganese.. On the foot wall
drifts were started east and west; the east
drift is in about 10 feet, coming to a heavy
body of iron ore, which, however, lias gone
out in the bottom of the face of the drift, and
shows considerable fair looking quartz.
The west drift from the crosscut is in.21
feet in the same body of iron ore shown in
tlie east drift. The south side of this drift
shows some very good looking ore.
The hoisting is done with a 10 horse power
engine, and a No. 4 Knowles pump handles
the water, the combination making an exceed
ingly good and inexpensive prospecting outfit,
with which it will probably be possible to
sink 200 feet.
Messrs. Largey & Armstrong have also
bonded the Emma mine, which adjoins the
Czaroma, giving them 2,150 feet on this lead.
Little has been done on the Emma outside of
running a few open cuts across the croppings
to prove the continuity of the vein ; it shows
the whole length of this claim. At the
Morning Star Mine
The property ot Messrs. Faraday & Clark, the
east shatt is down 40 feet, following a narrow
ledge of remarkably high grade ore ; 25 feet
from the surface a drift is in 17 feet, showing
a ledge from 10 to 16 inches m width; in the
face it is about a foot wide. A drift has been
started east at this point, in which tlie ore
body is a little wider.
The east drist from the bottom of tlie shaft
is in 75 feet ; at one point the ore iu the low
er level is 2 feet wide ; it will not, however,
average over 12 inches in the face ; the forma
tion is considerably broken, although it shows
several narrow seams of ore, with a great deal
of manganese intermixed. Manganese was
first encountered in this drift about 65 feet
from the shaft, and from there the ore carried
quite a percentage of it.
Fifty feet from the shaft a raise is up about
15 feet ; here a stope was started, from which
a great deal of ore was extracted, which, Mr.
Faraday tells me, went 448 ounces in silver
and $126 in ^old ; tlMUtop «f the stope now
shows aboàt l&Laiebfes où lttOp'Uoki
"The «est drift from the. botUtu of the shaft
is ln 186 feet, where it makes connection with
tlie west shaft at a depth of 64 feet ; in this
drift the ledge is some what irregular, in places
pinching to a mark, and again opening out to
from 18 inches to 2 feet in width ; it was,
however, uniformly of a very high grade ; the
ore from this drift averages, as per battery
sample, 93 ounces in silver and $53 in gold.
The west drift is down 93 feet ; 54 feet from
the surface a drift lias been run west 100 feet,
coming on au ore body about a foot wide ; in
tlie face, however, it lias narrowed considera
bly. A station has been opened on the 93 foot
level, which it is the intention to push east
and west from the shaft as expeditiously as
possible. Sinking will not be resumed in this
shaft for some time, the whim being unable
to handle the water.
A new shaft will be started soon on the
croppings about 150 feet cast of the east shaft;
some rich float was found there, and they ex
pect to find the same body of high grade ore
which is now being prospected in the two old
shafts. The
Tom. Haney,
Owned by Messrs. Owsley & Black, is at pres
ent being worked through a shaft 43 feet deep,
which has been floored over at a depth of 25
feet from the surface, and a drift started east
and west in the ledge ; tlie shaft down to this
point carries a heavy body of manganese ore
from 3 to 5 feet wide, which assays, I am told,
very well. A large quantity of it is being ex
tracted for shipment to the smelter, when a
working test will more definitely prove the
value of this mine. At the
Gagnon Mine,
The hoisting engine has not yet started up,
consequently it is impossible to sink. The
west drift, 150 foot level, is still yielding a
large quantity of very high grade ore. The
stopes on the upper levels continue to look
well and are turning out their usual quantity
of free milling ore. At the
Alice Mine.
The bulkhead has been removed from the
500-foot level, and work resumed, although it
is still too wet to do much.
On the 400-foot level a magnificent breast
of ore has been opened. It is over forty feet
wide and a great deal of it is of very high
grade.
The stopes on the upper levels are yielding
their usual quantity of first-class ore, of which
there still remains an enormous and seeming
ly inexhaustable body in sight. The
Mountain Mine
Is looking about as usual, the various drifts
and stopes in the mine looking mueh as
usual.
Considerable first-class copper ore is being
raised daily. At the
Nettie Mine
There is no change of importance ; the bot
tom of the main shaft is looking about the
same as when last reported.
On the 45-foot level the face of the drifts
east aud west are looking finely, showing an
ore body from four to six feet wide.
On the 80-foot level the free ore continues
to be of an exceptionally high grade ; the
body of manganese ore in this level (four feet
wide) is unchanged.
A tunnel is being run on the west end of
the claim, in an easterly direction on the
ledge ; from here, considerable free ore is be
ing extracted.
The mine is turning out about six tons of
free ore daily. At tlie
Burnett Mine
The west drift from the tunnel continues to
look quite well. The stopes are at present
yielding a larger quantity of ore tlian for some
time past, which, however, is not of a very
high grade. At the
Gmy Rock Mine,
The main shaft is about 87 feet, seven feet of
^icli is used as sump. From the bottom of
the shaft a crosscut has been run south forty
ep
feet, where it strikes a body of high
free milling ore, which ranges in width
three to five feet. This crosscut will bif

ledge which is supposed to He about |
feet south of the above ore body.
