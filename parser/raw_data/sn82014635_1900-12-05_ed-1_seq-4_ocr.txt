The Way Wichita Was Worsted.
According to the official figures of the United States
census, Wichita lacks 329 people of having a population of
25,000. The superintendent of the census or some of his
authorized assistants no doubt estimate themselves as very
acute. In such an assumption they wronged this city.
When following the announcement in the Eagie that the
enumerators had practically concluded their work and were
making up their reports, a number of which had already
been forwarded to Washington, people commenced to pour
Into the office with the complaint that they had not been
counted. Of course the reports of the enumerators covering
some of the districts in which these complainants lived,
having been forwarded, there was no help. A per cent of
the others were registered in a supplemental way. It
seems that even these names were discarded by the bureau.
We do not know that it cuts much of a figure farther than
the disappointment of our own people. All of Wichita is
here Just the same, and Wichita has more than 25,000 peo
ple, or probably upward of 26,000. In every other particular
it Is the biggest and best town in the state by all odds,
and Census Superintendent Merriam after an. hoar's ride
about the city, or a panoramic view of It from Fairmount,
or a glimpse of its business streets, or a glance at its reg
istration books, would be ashamed of his report

136,967. Deducting his gains, ills net loss In the aforetime
solid south is 91,083.
In Idaho Mr. Bryan gained 6,225 over his vote of 1898,
although his plurality was reduced from 16,868 to 2,170. In
the other states carried in 1896 with the aid of the Populists
and Free Silver Republicans Colorado, Kansas, Montana
Nevada, Utah and Washington he lost 81,524, making a net
loss of 76,299 in these states. Mr. Bryan's losses In the
south and In the small western and northwestern states
exceed his total loss in the country
In the crucial states of New York, Illinois and Indiana
and in his own state of Nebraska Mr. Bryan ran behind
the Democratic state tickets.-
A Love Letter,
The Governor's Sensible Advice.
Governor Stanley suggests that the newly elected mem
bers of the legislature, before going to Topeka this winter,
6hall ascertain from their respective constituencies the de-t-ires
of the people, and thear wishes and opinions touching
the propositions to make appropriations of the people's
monies for the Pan-American exposition to be held at Buf
falo, and the semi-centennial exposition contemplated fori
Topeka, and in what amounts, if any. That is sensible
advice coming from the governor, and a safe one for the
state senators and representatives. The governor will In
his message urge the abolishing of perfunctory and unnec
essary offices, the cutting out of scores of legislative com
mittee clerkships, and a reduction of expenses all along the
lm, commencing with his own office and reaching every
public institution of the state. In this he should be sec
onded by every taxpayer in the state, and the way to sec
ond him is to instruct members-elect of the legislature.
Several hundred thousand dollars additional or extra is to
be asked of the coming legislature. Where is the sense of
monkeying at the spiggot with the bung-hole wide open?
In demanding economy and In lopping off the small steals
and stopping the little leaks, the larger appropriations
should not exceed the real necessities, and these based upon
sound reason. The burdens of the people come, in the first
place, from saddling them with too many unnecessary of
ficers, who, in turn, in addition to their own salaries, impose
unexpected and unwarranted expenses. If the Republican
party of Kansas would avoid hearing a howl from the peo
ple, and later relegation, let its representatives in the legis
lature heed and act upon the common sense advice of the
qoernor. Even President McKinley, in his message of
jesterday, calls attention to the fact that extravagance in
the past has cost the Republican party dearly, and that in
expecting a repetition of it, the opposition bases all of Its
present hopes for a victory four years hence.
The Fast Mail Train to be Abandoned.

from the Missouri river to Newton, between midnight and

McKinley Demands an Open Door for All.
The cotton manufacturers of the south, who recently
petitioned Secretary Hay to do his utmost to maintain the
"open door" principle In China, gave expression to a desire
which should be shared by every manufacturer In the coun
try, whether he be an exporter or not. Manufacturers of
goods suitable for export have at last begun to realize that
they can compete In the markets of the world, and that the
bugaboo of cheap foreign labor is an innocuous scarecrow
of which they need not be afraid. Moreover, they have
acted upon this realisation to such good purpose that the
exports of American manufactured goods doubled during
the past four years, and will reach a grand total this year
exceeding $400,000,000. The American manufacturer has
alone found out (what his foreign competitor has long since
known) that it Is export demand which keeps factories busy
and a constant supply of competent workmen at hand when
the home demand Is slack. He is thus naturally interested
In the development of all foreign markets, and in the main
tenance of the "open door" not only in China, but in the
Orient generally.
The manufacturer of the non-exportable goods is af
fected indirectly by the Increase of the export demand. If
the exporter enjoy a prosperous foreign trade, so mucb
greater are the demands which he makes upon the product
of the manufacturer who produces goods solely for domestic
consumption. There is every possibility that the two other
great manufacturing nations Great Britain and Germany
seeing the situation in the light of self-interest, will stand
shoulder to shoulder with the United States in demanding
an "open door" in China. The manufacturers in this coun
try should have little fear of the outcome under such con
ditions. Martin Engel, leader of the Red IJght dstrict of New
York, says: "I'm a Democrat because I like Croker." The
Democratic party is to be congratulated that that is Bngel's
only reason for bemg a Democrat.
It is said that Dick Croker wants Tammany cleaned
