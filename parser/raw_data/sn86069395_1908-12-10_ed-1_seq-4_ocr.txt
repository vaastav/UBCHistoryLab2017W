An alleged detective wno is writ j

and magnifying rumors from the

and boastful personal experiences is
much mixed in somepf his stories
given as an eyewitness He says he
saw a bandage around the head of
the wounded leader nearly five
months after his temple was grazed
by a bullet in the attack on Hopkins

it stunned him for awhile befog so
slight that he pulled his hat overit

Atlanta Democrats showed th tt
even party loyalty can be put to too
severe a test A mayor noted for
his dissipation and unfitness forced
himself upon the party for re nomi
nation but the civic league nominat
ed another Democrat whose charac
ter was above reproach and he was
elected by 8000 maj rityWe warn
the Democratic party now that the
nominees for circuit judge And com
monwealths attorney next year
must be men who are known to be
worthy There are mutterings of a
coming storm and if men known to
be in sympathy with lawlessness
force themselves upon the party re
member that happened inDemocrat
ic Atlanta
AtlantaEditor
Editor GeoS Weathers has this
to say in the Elkton Times
Whenever the Hopkinsville Ken
tuckian copies anything from neigh
boring exchanges generally it gives
the particular exchange due credit
This rule holds good until it copies
something from the Todd County
Times Then because the editor of
the Kentuckian has always hated the
editor of the Times and God knows
theres no love lost it deliberately
refuses to give this paper any credit
whatever The Times has never t
pursued the same course with refer
ence to the Kentuckian The editor
doesnt hold himself up as a bright
and shining light in any church but
he believes to some extent in return
ing good for evil and doesnt believe
that the proper way to fight is to
swipe something from an enemyj
The Times has no ambition to bej
made conspicuous in the columns of
the Kentuckian it just simply hates
to see such manifestations of little
ness on the part of the Kentucky
editor We are glad the other Hop j
kinsville newspaper have better j
judgment as to what constitutes
honesty in journalism J
It is the settled policy of the Ken
tuckian to give due credit for all
items reproduced from other papers
We are at a loss to Understand
what has provoked the paragraph
above If we have neglected to give
credit for any item used from the
Times it was entirely 1tentional
We will go further and say that we
have never knowingly done an injury
to Mr Weathers Our acquaintance
with him is so slight that we have no
recollection of having met him more
than once or twice and if we ever
exchanged a dozen words with him
we do not now recall it His part
ner learned the trade in this office
and for him we entertain the veryI
kindliest of feelings and would be
glad to be on the same pleasant
terms with Mr Weathers if we
could find out what his grievance is
and be able to remove it He has
said many unkind things about use
more perhaps than any other editor
in the state bnt we have attributed
ft to differences of opinion on the
night rider question and not to per
sonal enmity We are sorry to know
that he entertains hatred a feeling
we assure him is not at all recipro
cated It Mr Weathers will tell
what we have done to incur his djs
pleasure wqwill do ajf that a gen
tleman could to make amends for
what was certainly an unintentional
offenseListOi
