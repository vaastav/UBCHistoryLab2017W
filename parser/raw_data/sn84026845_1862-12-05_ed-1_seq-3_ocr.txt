I#- A Cospiobnj'b Oamk ? Mr Ludlow,
of this city, ht*9 bp*n Afijseiit for ?orii** tiiu?a
in the Slate of Inriiiinn. V* .s*' nlr?y he re
taroed home. Between Coininbus and this
city, on the Contral Ohio Railroad, be was
approached, while sitting in tbe can, by
a distressed looking individual who .said
be was far away from home and frieids
and was badly in want of money. This
being a very common want it did not ex*
cite any particular interest in Mr. Ludlow,
bat tbe fellow looked and acted as If be
was in actual need. He said be bad a val
uable gold watch upon which he would
like to borrow a small sum of money, re
serving tbe privilege of redeeming tbe
watch when be arrired at Bridgeport. Mr.
Ludlow took tbe watch and gave the unfor
tunate man eleven dollars. Upon reaching
Bridgeport tbe man was not visible, and
Mr. Ludlow ascertained that the watob(
though it glittered, was not gold?that it |
was not, in short, worth a shilling.

os St. Gaoaoa.?Mr. Enoch Manier and
family reached tbe city la?t evening from
Tucker county. He reports that there is
great excitement ia that county. When he
left, it was reported and confidently be
lieved that the rebel Imboden was advanc- I
iog upon St. George with a considerable |
force.
Some time ago Gun. Milroy levied a con
tribution upon certain rebels about St*
George for the purpose of making good tbe
losses sustained by Union men from the
numerous rebel raids in Tucker county.?
The contribution amounted to about $3000
and the order of Gen. Milroy made it pay
able upon this day, tbe 5tb, under penalty
of seizure and punishment. The rebels
thus assessed were endeavoring to make
tbe payment, and it was supposed that Im
boden was coming to relieve them.

We have received from the Book and Sta
tionery house of J. C. Orr<k Co.,100 Main St.
a lot of very nice books, intended for tbe
young folks, among them "The Black Cliff,
and other stories of the Parables," "Tbe
Shepherd of Bethlehem," 1 Ned Manton, or
the Cottage by tbe Stream," "The Torn
Bible," and "Vesper," a translation from
tbe French of tbe Countess of Gasparin.
These are a series of very charming little
stones, such as young people delight in,
through all of which runs a deeply relig
ious but not sectarian vein. The books
are prettily bound and are just about tbe
nicest things for presents during the ap
proaching holidays that the young people
could wish for.

four inches water in the ohannel of-the

Never does he allow the ttag or bis.country
to be taraisbed in its fair fame by being
borne la the hands of a plundering, lawless
suldiery, who, by their shameless scandals,
not only render rebels more rebellious still,
but drive loyal citizen* from their fealty

Xkw Yoke, Deo 4.?The Herald has the
following:
WasBiiiiToN, Dec. 2 ?There is nothing
of importance from tbe Army of tbe Poto
mac. Averill'e cavalry has not yet return
ed from their reconnoissance. Everything
remains perfectly quiet and there is no pros
pect of an immediate movement. The army
is well supplied with rations and forage ?
The rebels have about 50 batteries large 1
and small, some of Ihem mounting heavy
guns bearing upon tbe north bank of tbe j
Rappahannock. It is said said our pon
toons in being carried to a position where
they were to be used, passed nearly the
tbe whole distance along tbe river road in I
plain view of the cuenir. And this fact
together with the other that tbe proposed 1
movement *u expected by the Tirxet' cor-1
respondent induces belief that a desperate J
light will ensue on an attempt on our part]
11 cross. A large amount of fresh vegeta
bles have been ordered for Sumner and
Franklin's old corps, scurvy having made
its appearance among them. 1
Government is taking steps whereby the I
railroad from Aquia Creek to Frederfcks
burg will be provided with rolling stock
accessary to furnish supplies, troops, 4c.11
to Burnslde's armj.
The Timet' special says: Ilia proper to I
state that Burnside never possessed the l
confidence of the government aore than at
present, and that since bis recent visit to
Washington tbe confidence baa resulted in I
a very great increase on bis powers and his
liberation from many of the restraints on.
der which be previously labored. All ru- I
mors to the effect that the army of tbePo- I
tomuc will go into winter quarters, are I
sheer fabrications. There will he no cessa- I
tiou till rebellion is beyond the power of J
inflicting further mischief.
Our advices from Falmouth and Freder
icksburg confirm the information lately re-1
ceived that Lee is removing a large portion
of bis forces southward, and concentrating |
them in sncb a manner as to be able, eith
er to march to tbe relief ol Richmond in I
case ol an attnck in tbe flank, or to act as I
a reserve in case of an assault in Freder- |
icksburg.
The Alabama?The Public Debt.
Nkw Yobk, Dec. 4.?At a meeting of the I
Chamber of Commerce to-day a letter was I
read from Secretary Welles.
An additional force will be despatched
in search of the Alabama as soon as prac- [
ticable.
There is no authority for granting com*
missions to private vessels to search for I
tbe Alabama or any other piratical vessels
or privateers.
Tbe Chamber adopted a resolution to I
ask tbe government to send several vessels
to cruise on the eastern shore of South [
America.
The Pott's Washington despatch sajrs I
Secretary Chase's report goes north by the I
evening mail to-day. His estimate of tbe I
public debt is that it will exceed one thous
and and fifty millions on the first of July |
next.
Caiho, Dec. 4.?Memphis papers say that I
Gen. Holmes crossed from Arkansas to the
Mississippi at Vicksburg last week with
a force estimated at 40,000.
Tbe guerrillas are still very troublesome
in the vicinity of Memphis. They contin
ue to burn cotton and press men into the I
Confederate service. They have also pick
ed up numbers of stragglers from oar ar- 1
my. *
An expedition which left Halena last I
week said to have numbered 20,000 men, I
landed 12 miles below to move over land ]
toward Grenada. _
Niw Voak, Dec. 4.?A Falmouth letter I
of tbe 2d states that there are rumors and |
Other indications of an early movement, if*
made will probable be a mere change of po- I
sition, though involving perhaps a consid- 1
erable.engagement. Obstacles to a gener- I
al and final advance of tbe army still exist.

menU.
(S|?cUI to the New York Tribone.)
Near Falmouth, Va.
Dark, lowering clouds forewarn of mud
dy roads. The air is freighted with white
snow flakes, and ohill, shivering prophe
cies of winter. Still we rest, and are
likely to rest for dajs to come.
"What is the army waiting tor?" asks the
country which has sacrificed so much, and
felt so long the hope deferred which maketh
the heart sick.
Attempting to answer, I violate no offi
cial confidences, for I am the depository
of none. 1 give no information to the reb
els, for 1 only cite facts which they know
as well as we.
The capture of Richmond, to possess
East Tennessee and cut its great railroad
aitery, to open the Mississippi and clear its
valley, are obviously the keys to success,
the immediate aims of the government.
Preparations for the two latter move
ments are nearly complete, nnder Rose
crans, Grant, McClernand, and Porter?
men in the habit of accomplishing wh&t
they undertake.
It is vitally important that when the col
umns move they will move in concert.?
Press the enemy simultaneously at every
Kint. Strike air the blows at once. Give ,
mberton no leisure to strengthen Bragg
?Bragg no time to reinforce Lee.
Our Western columns are not quite
ready; neither is the army of the Potomac.
Had it beeo possible Burnsld^ would
i have pushed forwar dinstantly when we ar
I rived here. The rebel army was divided
and scattered. We had the interior line,
and would have fought it !o detail, or
seached.Richmond before it.
Xon it is concentrated on our front, all
save the ubiquitous Stonewall Jackson.?
The main force of the enemy, his veteran
troops, bis largest, most reliable army, is
within striking distance of the Rappahan
neck, on oar road to Richmond.
That road will be difficult, snoogb at
best. We shall have mad to contend with,
lines to keep opeo, end streams to cms, In
the face of an enemy?the most formidable
undertaking of war. Every mlfe wBli take
us farther from onr base and carry the
rebels nearer theirs.

Without risk* we cannot bin war (a truth
which the latacommander, with all bis mil
itary- knowledge, nmr learned), hot we
cannot afford anj unnecessary hazard.?
Whan we advance we moat be able to move
"in the order of an arm/, and with the
weight of a nation." Like the old Roman
legioo, if onr firat line is battered and our
eecoad dnveo back, we most hare a third
line that is invincible, to torn the tide.
