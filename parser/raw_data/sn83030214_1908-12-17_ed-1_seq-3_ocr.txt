It was declared that the incident aright be regard

Scenes of excitement, arose over the discussion
In the House of the imnMßt bill to grant a
credit of 5300.000 for the benefit 'of the employes
of the prisons administration -who were $*ctims of
outrages while on duty, or of their families If the
employes were killed. The Socialist* and Laborites
hotly denounced the administration and the In
quisitorial torturing methods applied to political
prisoners.
Deputy Peeanoff, in a specially violent speech,
asserted that as a result oi the rigorous rule *
p-r cent of the prisoners developed consumption.
The Rightist Deputies angrily protested against
this, -whereupon M. Rosanoff declared that the
Rightists possessed less honor than Russian con
victs on the ewe of execution.
President Khomyakoff. in response) to a. stam

upon M. Roeaaoft to withdraw this expression.
M Rosanoff did ■», to the satisfaction of the presi

\O AMERICANS FOUXD,
Result of Search of Panama Canal
Archives.
"Washington. Dec. I*s. President Roosevelt to-day
sent to Congress a letter of the Secretary cf war
transmitting- a memorandum prepared by Judgs
Chaxlton. law offlc-r of the bureau of Insular af
fairs, and Richard R. Rogers, the general counsel
of --« Isthmian Canal Commission, bearing further
on the charges that Americans were Interested In
the Panama Canal property at the time of the pur
chase by the United States. The memorandum says
that at the time the property was transferred It in
cluded the so-called "archives,** and they ar* now
in possession of this government.
Examinations of these archives by ifeaatflL Charl
ton and Ropers show, however, that neither at the
tin-, of the first examination, In May. IPOS. nor now,
were there among the records any lists of stockhold
ers in. the old or New Panama, Canal Company ex
cept those contained In the formal minutes. The
minutes of the last meeting before the transfer of
the property were not contained 1n the archives
surrendered, and the law officers say that the United
Staxes government had no concern In th°rn. It is
believed to be impossible, therefore, to gather from
records in the possession of this government the
names of any Americans, if any there may have
been, who profited by th- sale of the property to
the United States.
DELAFAN SMITH'S -REPLY.
Assumes to See "Pitiable Exhibition"
in Presidents Message.
Indianapolis, Dec 16.— The Indianapolis News,"
edited by Delavan Smith, mentioned In the sp-ciaJ
message on the Panama Canal deal sent to Con
gress yesterday by President Roosevelt, issued a.
reply to the Chief Executive to-day. It says:
It is difficult to characterize fully the latest cut
break of the President without resorting to the use
of language as undignified and blameworthy as
that which put the President's utterance in a class
by Itself ia the official literature of the high offlee
he holds. "Whatever provocation Mr. Roosevelt
rnav have felt pricking his etul nothing could Just
ify or much less extenuate the torrent of invective
and virulence which he pour-d oat In a state Paper
upon the heads of private citizens. No one in ni3
sober senses can fail to regard the performance
as a grave derogation to the dignity of the Presi
dential station, a pitiable exhibition of tewering
rage on the part of the Chief Magistrate, and the
source of humiliation and chagrin to the entire
country- It is quite impossible to think of any
of Mr. ' Roosevelt's long line of distinguished pred
ecessors that cruld possibly have so forgotten the
dignities and decencies of his exalted position as
to transmit to Congress a message la any wa>
comparable vtth that of yesterday.

SCHURMAN ON WEALTH
TALKS OF ITS PROBLEMS.
Attacks Socialism, — Praises Public
Service Board Idea.
Omaha, D-c 18.— principal speak*- at to
day's exercises at. the National Cora Exposition
was Dr. Jacob Gould Srhunnan, president of Cor
nell University, who gave an address aa "Our
TCatlonal Outlook.** in which be Hactjaaßd the
problem of great fortunes. The Immense concert
hall of the exposition building: was packed when
the distinguished educator was introduced by
Charles G-. Rosewat-r, chairman of the maarJag.
Dr. Echurman aaU that the majority of the
problems interesting American voters were eco
nomic questions, the situation betas Irerjeifled
her* by the existence of great and increasing in-
qualities of economic conditions. Inequalities of
wealth, he said, fostered socialism, tut the. social
ist's panacea would destroy the genius, ene-jry and
initiative of the Individual.
The socialistic supposition thai the etat* could
maaan great industrial enterprises as well as
private Individuals. Dr. Schurman said, was re
futed every day by experience and observation.
•'Socialistic schemes, like government ownership
and control of railways." the educator continued,
"have little attraction for the American people.
They recognize that, to buy the railroads, the
state or nation would need to borrow large sums
of money, precisely as the present owners issue
stock and bonds to secure capital."
Dr. Bahurman said that, while he gladly recog
nized that improvement In conditions had been
effected, he thought that "the magic of property"
must somehow touch the unpropertled classes,
who must not be merely wage earners, bat must
also have "a stake In the community." Th:s prob
lem, he said, teemed capable of solution at the
hands of great corporations, and he instanced the
United States Steel Corporation. In which nearly
one hundred thousand workmen are share aolders.
He continued:
Colossal fortunes are on trial in this emmtry.
Whether and how far it lo worth while to encour
age and protect them is a question for th- «*are.
The voters of the country who will answer ' r , will
have their sentiments and opinions Influenced^ by
the use to which these owners put their^fortunes
in their lifetimes, and the manner la , whioh thf^
dispose of them at their death. }et th«-r» is one
fundamental fact which is nk-lv to be overlooked
by radicals, though it is essential to a . just consid
eration of the whole question. I allude to the
circumstance that, not jnly are great fortunes
usually safer in the hands of the peopie w ho ha , . c
made them than in any other hands, but in obedi
ence to economic laws they must be employed in
the maintenance of productive enterprises wnica
benefit the consuming public and pay wages to
employes as well as earn profits for the owners.
Tet a life devoted solely to making money would
seem a sordid and wretched one.. , And  this
is the testimony of our multi-millionaires them-
6 believe' that the conduct of a few mu^ti-mlllion
aire-s now living is likely to determine the attitude
and shape the policy of the public toward the phe
nomenon of colossal fortunes for many years to
come. If they use them in the Interest of the pub
lic the public will not begrudge them their suc
cess. If they use them for the aggrandizement or
family or the consolidation of private interests, we
are likely to se» attacks on the existing aws or
bequest. " . . . They have declared that to die
rich is to die disgraced: that the community con
tributed as much as the multi-millionaire <if not
more) to the making of his fortune; and that th«
community Is entitled to Us share when the dis
tribution comes. If this view or some such vi-w
generally prevails, we may feel assured • lat the
t*ist-ibutlon of large fortunes will be accomplished
with satisfaction and advantage to the community
without interference on the part of the govern
ment. And government mterfe.-ence in the field of
economic distribution is always fraught with the
gravest p-rils. It. is apt to mark, indeed, the begin
ning of revolution. •.. ■ -^ :'•-■ - .
Turning then to the subject of legislation against
trußts. Dr. Schunnan said that If a vast aid 'wise
policy could be formulated and established in re
gard to the rights and obligations of the owners of
great fortunes, as well as the claims of the public,
calm and Impartial discussion of til* problem of
trusts and corporations would be easier. He said:
The simple fact Is that a large corporation or so
called trust is mereiv a mode of organialnr mod
ern business. It eliminates expenses, secures em
ciency, and by means of production on a large
scale "cheapens" the coat of commodities.
It is fully to attempt to legislate agai-ist the
natur- of things. The Legislature -anna rein
state competition in the economic world whfn com
p»titlon has given wav ss it has in modem tim-s
to combination, consequently it is a safe assertion
that the anti-trust law of 18W must be repealed.
"Veitn-r th- public nor Conareaa can Instru-t busi
ness men in the methods of transacting their af
fair" Let the public and Congress ha^e a nzht
to insist thai in tha transaction of business there
shall be no infringement of the rights of the public
no injurious monopoly, no oppression en her or
rivals or consumers.
So too, a wise and Just solution of the problem
of great fortunes will enable us to take « canT
vi«=w of railway and mh«r public service corpora
tions- . . The problem of the supervision and
regulation of public service corporations baa, un
s<>? the atateamanallke leadership of Governor
Hughes, been satisfactorily solved in th- State of
New York. Two commissions hay- been estab
lished to represent the state, which ar- rloth»d
with larger powers and have authority to enforce
against tie corporations th- obligations whi:h th»y
assum-d when they re^eiv-d their franchises . - .
If the commissions assert the rights of. ram p-"
r l,» rh-v also recognize the rights of the public
■ervice corporations By tJ ■- never lo*e sight
of the fact that th- corporation, when it has
received its franchise from rh- stat-. lanxmed
obligations in th- wav of efficient service, at a
r»=i=on*b!e cost whl-h the state has a right to
enfor^- and which the stat-, through these com
missions. Is --i actually enforcing.
