At the conclusion of Senator Morrill's

Bills were introduced and referred as
follows:
Bv Mr. 'Wheeler: To incorporate a
Banking Asseciatiou, with a capital of
one huudred million dollars, under the
style of the "Government and Manage
ment of the Exchequer ot the United
States of America."
By Mr. Myers: (Jiving two thousand
dollars pension to the widow of General
Meade.
By Mr. Harris: To allow farmers and
plauters to sell leaf tobacco without re
strictions, aud modifying the tax on re
tail dealers.
By -Mr. Taffe: To sell certain lauds to

Mr. l)awes presented a bill for the re
lief of the Boston sufferers, on which a
discu ion cn.-ucd. after which the bill
passed unanimously. The bill corre
sponds with a like bill for the relief of
Chicago, save that it does not exempt
lumber
The House then resumed consideration
of (he bill providing for ten sloops of war.
Mr. Potter contended that it was not
practicable for a vessel of five or 3ix
hundred tons to carry ten large guns;
that the statement bv Mr. Schofield,
j Chairman of the Naval Committee, was
, not correct; but that the statement
' made by Mr. Platte, that the vessels
I ought to 1 from fifteen hundred to two
iliousanu tous, was nearer the mark.
Such vessels could not be built for auy
' thing like the sum mentioned. Such
vessels, for war purposes, would cost
. from eight hundred thousand to one
million of dollars. He believed that the
actual cost or these vessels would ap
proach one million dollars for each one.
He concluded: "The House is entitled
to much better information than it had
ic eived on the subject, aul to have a
matured plan submitted for the creation
of a Navy, before they were called upon
to vote for this bill."
Mr. Cox argued that Messrs. Hall and
Scholield had confessed that each was
opposed to the plan of building ships,
which was a vicious one, and distributed
private contracts as jobs to the i t' r
uavy-yards, which were also proo,b..i
aud wasteful. Both gentlemen had not
laid stress enough iu tlie mischiefs that
require reform. The uavy-yards need
reform, especially as to employes and
policies, who shall now reform the ac
knowledged jobbery and private con
tracts, as Uie bill was an immature
makeshift, and as something ought to
lie done, he favored reducing tlie num
ber of sloops to six, three to be built at
private yards snd three at the navy-yard.-:,
aud to tftf- 'it with a less
sum until information aud a 'ter plan
was given.
Mr. Beck opposed the bill ou the
ground that money heretofore appro
priated for such purposes had beeu spent
ou worthless ships, (but hundred aud
seventy-one of which had been sold in
the past five years in ways that Con
gress knew nothing of, and even to the
lowest instead of the highest bidder.
He did not know but what these ten
vessels would be declared unfit for ser
vice and sold liefore thev were luilt.
It iiad been charged in the
Senate by Mr. Edmunds, of Ver
mont, that oue vessel had been
sold for nineteen thousand dollars,
which, setting one coat of paiut was
sold for twelve thouiati.l dollars in the
course of a few weeks.
Mr. Kerr urged a postponement of the
bill, as the House w- not in possession
of information to act intelligently, for
the Secretary of the Navy 's report was
extremely and discreditably void of such
information. Healsooppoaed the bill be
cause this countrv did not aspire to be a
great military or naval power. The
j mm nun o.i p uow ou a jcuce iooi-
ing, and could be further reduced with
advantage. Security was to be found
not iu great standing armies or navy,
but effectually exists iu the complete
power of a mighty nation. What was
mere mqieriiueucc wax reiurm oi ex
isting scandalous laws affecting our re
lations witn othci nations so they could
build up a great and jsiwcrful com
mercial navy.
Mr. Cogbly opposed, and Mr. Kaudall
supported the amendment to have half
the vessels built in private yards.
The discussion was continued by
Messrs. Archer, Myers, Lynch, Hale
and Schofleld, ull in favor of tlie bill,
Mr. Hale defending the Navy Depart
ment Horn the aspersions cast upon it,
and Mr. Schofield, Chairman of the Na
val Committee, urging that all vessels
ootid be constructed iu the navy-yards
sooner and lietier than iu private yards.
Mr. Garfield ottered an amendment
providing that no contract or order for
tlie construction of these vessels be
malic until full detailed estimates are
submitted to Congress, and appropiia.

Mr. Sargent opposed the amendment
as dilatory. au! advocated the bill.
Mr. Sbeilabitrger favored the con
struction of veiels carrying less than
six guns, as a mere effective in etiforciug

the villain then instantly stabbed Crev
eston in the breast, inflicting a wound
from which he died this afternoon.
The whole neighborhood is aroused,
aud he is hotly pursued, though fleeing
on horseback. Creveston said it was on

posed he meant robbery, as the mur

Smallpox plays an important part in
criminal matters. Harry 'runnier bad
been searching four days for a lot of
stolen silverware which was taken from
E. M. Appersou. He found oue spoon
of all the missing property in the house
of an old negro woman, who had been a
servant at Appersou's; but just reflect
on his feelings searching the shanty in
view of the fact that the old woman was
lying iu bed with the smallpox. He
faced the danger boldly and seaiched
the premises vigilantly, but could find
nothing but the smallpox and tbe odd
spoon. That spoou is now at the Chief's
office, but uo one will go within ten feet
feet of it. The thievish old woman is
saved the trouble of arrest by her com
fortable affliction. It is reported that
three or four inmates of the jail are try
ing the smallpox dodge, with the ex
pectation of getting out. Tbe blue flag,
or "yallar," provided for by Halstead's
resolution, will be a very couveuient
thing to bang out wherever thieves or
murderers are concealed. It will be as
good as a ten-feet wall to save them from
the police.
It may naturally be expected of a he
roic policeman that he will face death
iu the shape of slung-shot, bowie-knives,
pistols, swords, daggers, tlie sharp nails
of nymph du ixti'e, and paving stones
indiscriminately allied round by an in
furiated mob. attack it in the shape
of fire, or risk drowning, blowing up or
scalding, but not in the direful and loath
some garb of smallpox. Tbe yellow
jack is more tolerable. It is too much
to expect that policemen will face death
in the shape of smallpox for ninety dol
lars per mouth. No man would do it.
Ciesar himself would shrink from it.
A man of fine face and physique, which
our policemen all have, would not jeop
ardize those invaluable qualities for four
times the pay. Whenever a thief here
after wishes to elude pursuit he will have
nuthiug to do but get behind a yellow
rag and he is safe. Here is how the
dodge works in Louisville, as told bv
the Courier-Journal. Smith, the hero of
the tale, was incarcerated for murder:
"On the morning of Thanksgiving
day, November 18th, Dr. Pope, the jail
physician, was summoned to the jail to
examine Smith, who exhibited symp
toms of smallpox. Dr. Pope made the
examination in tbe cell of Smith, aud
found every symptom, as it appeared, of
smallpox. It is to be presumed, how
ever, that the two recent cases should
have presupposed this to be tbe fact,
with the symptoms so similar to those
of that disease. However this may be,
application was made for the immediate
removal of Smith to the pest-house, as a
measure of simple safety to the other
prisoners. This was done, and Smith,
by some means, managed to elude the
vigilance of the nurses, and ou Friday
morning last, at six o'clock, made his
escape from the pest-house, and re
mained at large until yesterday after
noon, when his capture was effected.
He seeined to take his re-capture very
good-humoredly, and, as he was brought
back to jail, laughingly said, 'Well,
boys, here I am again.' After he was
recommitted to jail, Dr. Pope, Dr. Lu lis
ten 1 Yaudell, jr.. aud Dr. D. Cummin-,
made an examination of the supposed
smallpox pustule- aud fouud them to
have been caused by the application of
croton oil. We tiad omitted to say that
after the first examination by Dr. Pope,
on the morning of the twenty-eighth,
tlie patient was examined by Dr. For
rester, physician in charge of the Uni
ted States prisoners in the jail, who
gave the same division as to the dis
ease." It will lie easily seen how efficient an
ally smallpox may become to thieves
and stabbers, cracksmen and house
breakers, and all that class. Instead pf
doing something iu a quiet, effectual
way to remedy the evil, our city author
ities are bent ou nothing so "much as
making what is vulgarly termed a
"splurge" about it, by providing for
yellow flags aud talking committees,
for the purpose of scaring jieople to
death. We published the other day au
effectual remedy against this evil, which
is now said to be very' bad out along the
lines of the railroads two or three hun
dred miles from Memphis. The coun
try people generally wine into the city
for remedies, aud are astonished to find
that there is so comparatively little of it
here. This is due to the fact that the
city being the focus of learning and
scientific investigation, prompt reme
dies mav be aDufied bv which the con-
tageou is neutralized and cured. The
druggists are doiug a sweeping business
iu specifics for the epizootic in meu and
horses.
A 8M.4SHEK.
it Unanswerable Appeal ami t onelu
slvs A r anient Ttere should be
r'euisle Scbool Visitors.
Editoks Appeal It seems to me
that discussing the propriety of having
ladies ou the School Board is presuming
on the ignorance of the people. 1 pre
fer to give the dear people the benefit of
the charitable supposition that they are
a reading and thinking people that
they are already iuformed that tbe most
intelligent, and progressive, and best
educated people in the world (the peo
ple of England i, put their best, wealth
iest and most aristocratic ladies on then
School Boards. Surely, if Miss Burdett
Coutts, in her high estate, considers it
t as she says) an honor to serve England
as a School Visitor, it is decidedly
affected and ridiculous for plain
American men aud women to
olfer puny opinions ou the propriety of
womeu's serving on school boards. Let
us nave uo more nonsensical discussions
on that score. They are unworthy of
space ina first-class newspaper or journal.
We need less dilapidated seutiment,aud
more vigorous common sense. It is well
to devote that .-pace to better matter, as
you have already suggested, and require
the lady candidates for School Visitor
to give the public tbe benefit of their
views and plan- of education. Let us
bear H iu miud that we are not after
fruitless discussion, of women or men,
but that education, public schools and
children, with all other interests, are
the themes of our disctissions, and that
we should hold to the texts. Mrs. A.
Msriwether gave us, in m very sensible
article in the Apfkal of yesterday, four
. wise suggestions on these important
subjects. Let us hear from tlie other
ladies. I think few, if any, intelligent
members of this community object to
this course, or in any respect object to Lady
School Yisitor. J have, thus far, heard
but one objection offered by a
woman, I am sorry to say
that is: "Women are so prying; they
would investigate ever)' affair. It is easy
enough to footmen, but you can't cheat
women ; thev trill see what goes on, aud
bow it goes." Important argument in
favor of lady School Visitors! A city
paper, the Daily Register, suggests that
the school business is too dirty for ladies
to work with. Sad commentary on our
much-lauded public schools ! That being
the case, it is desirable that tbe ladies
should have a "cleaning day," and put
things in order. If there are any Impu
rities about public schools that mothers
are not permitted to investigate, the in
ference is that such schools are not proper
places for the children of those mothers.
It is in very bad taste, at least, to hurl,
even in newspaper articles, "tobacco,"
"whisky," etc., at p n. lie schools, to de
ter mothers from investigating them. It
is the most winning of all ways to in
duce mothers to withdraw their children
and tax-payers to condemn the entire
system of public education, which is
already half the burden of complaint
against heavy taxation. Let us have
lady School Visitors, if for no other rea
son than for the sake of investigation.
Let us know how perfect or imperfect
the school business is. a woman.
LIYKLY.
How Two Klndly-Uisposed Persons
Ciena One Another Onl in oleridisu.
Last Tuesday evening, Mr. Sanford
went into tbe Imperial Billiard Saloon,
in Meridian, to look on as a spectator of
the players. As he entered he observed
Mr. James Bell with a pistol in his
hand, and apparently intoxicated. Bell
remarked that lie thought Sanford was
that d n man , naming a man
who had threatened his j Bell's; life.
Sanford remarked, "You seem well
armed." A slight altercation ensued,
ending in Bell's flourishing his pistol
while Sanford got hold of a billiard cue.
Mr. Draughn, one of the bar-tenders,
came in and tried to get Bell out, when
Bell tired with a small cartridge derrin
ger, the ball taking effect in the right
side of Sanford's neck, causing him to
drop the cue, which he immediately
seized again by the large end and struck
at Bell, barely missing Mr. Dratighn's
head. Bell retreated around the
table toward the rear of the room
as Sanford advanced on him, and
drew a nine-inch revolver. Sanford
continued to press on him, and Bell re
treated arounil the tables and fired twice
more. Mr. Sanford was striking at him
all the time, but the counting strings
caught the cue and warded off tlie blows.
Sanford pursued him out into the bar
room, and just before Bell reached tlie
front door, struck him and brought him
to his knees, when Bell fired the fourth
shot, the powder burning San ford's arm.
Sanford, however, reached Bell, knock-
ed him down with bis fist, took the pis
tol away from him, when some one
jerked them apart. They tumbled
together out of the front door,
and SherifT Moseiey, who had wit
nessed the beginning of the affray,
arrested Bell. We will state that the
parties good-uattn ed people they are
never had a previous difficulty, uor
was there any eumity existing between
them. Mr. "Bell has since told Mr.
Sanford that he has no recollection
of tbe affair, and that the former has no
disposition to prosecute Bell. Sanford
made a very narrow escape. Besides
the wound in the neck, a ball from the
large pistol grazed his shoulder aud an
other passed through the rim of his hat,
within an inch of his bead.

The Indiana came up yesterday morn
ing, nearly six days out from New Or
leans, and discharged one hundred and
thirty -one bales of cotton, oue hundred
and twelve sacks of seed, aud fifty-four
casks of iron, and had two hundred tons
of freight for Cairo aud Kints on the
Ohio, principally sugar, molasses, etc.
including five hundred sacks of salt for
Hickman. The Olasgow passed down
before noon, adding ninety-two bales of
cot ton for New Orleans, aud w as loaded
deep. The Fannie Lewis came dowu
the night previous, aud laid here until
night yesterday to discharge sixty tons
of freight and add oue hundred tons for
Vioksburg. The Cleburne arrived with
one hundred and twenty-four bales
of cotton, and four hundred aud fifty
eight sacks of seed. Tbe Tbos. H. Al
len came up the night before from
White river, with seven hundred and
seventeen bales of cotton the largest
trip of tbe season from that river to this
city and had it out and dropped down
to the wharf boat at noon yesterday,
where she rapidly filled up with freight,
and left at dark, with forty or fifty cabin
passenger.-. The St. Francis arrived be
fore noon, with forty-seven bales of cot
ton, and one hundred and eighty-seven
sacks of seed, aud went back to
the St. Francis river soon after dark
well laden. The Bismarck came down
during the morning from a three days'
stay at Point Pleasant, but was more
anxious to get to her destination than
she was to take freight, aud left drawing
fully six feet four inches of water. The
Tyrone Laid over until nearly dark, get
ting thereby two hundred bales of cot
ton, additional, and making her a cargo
of one thousand bales for Evansvilie.
Tbe Legal Tender came up from Vicks
burg with thirty-six bales of cotton
which she put out and laid up, as
freights are getting as thin as is the wa
ter ou the crossings above and below.
The Mayflower brought nearly a hun
dred tons, and lays over.
The Phil Allin, Captain
James Lee,
leaves this evening at five o'clock for
Friars Point and all way landings. W.
P. Orav is chief clerk.
Tbe United States mail packet G. W.
Cheek leaves this evening at five o'clock
for Friars Point and ail the way land
ings. Captain Malone commands and
Bobert Wildberger is clerk.
The Frank Forrest is tbe regular pack
et to leave at five o'clock this afternoon
for Fulton and intermediate landings.
0. K. Joplin is chief purser.
The United States mail steamer A. J.
White, Captain Mark Cheek, leaves
this afternoon at five o'clock for Napo
leon and all the bend landings. Messrs.
B. P. Fields, Charley Sharpe and Wm.

Cairo, Louisville, Cincinnati, and ail
business landings on the Ohio. We can
almost assure Captain Shunk that his
popular boat will leave here with a full
trip.
Miscellaneous.
One more boat is reported sunk.
A telegram from Cincinnati says
that the steamer Grey Eagle sunk
at James Landing, on vVednes
day night. She had a barge in
tow, and struck a stump one hundred
yards from tbe Indiana shore, and sunk
in twenty minutes. She was valued at
sixty-five thousand dollars; was insured
for forty thousand dollars, principally in
Louisville offices. Another telegram
states that she can be easily raised, that
no freight was damaged or lives lost.
The Indiana reports but six feet of
water at Beeves, and hardly that depth
at Fox Burns, below there. Tbe officers
of the Mayflower report Helena and
Montezuma bars much worse than they
have .-en this season, and state that
I since tney went down, the chauuel at
both places have changed very much.
Tbe Bismarck lost three days at Point
Pleasant, where she unloaded and double-tripped
it over, and left there Tues
day, when the Glencoe and Andy John
sou were there, and the Celeste, at work
lightering one of them over. When she
came down, the Carrie V. Kouutz had
been double-tripping over Island Tweu-ty-six,
and was then about to load her
freight and come down. The Kountz
had also beeu aground there. Tbe Bis
marck was drawing six feet and four
inches, and rubbed hard at half a dozen
places this side of Point Pleasant, and
her officers think it impossible for up
ward bound boats to get even to Poiut
Pleasaut. where they are drawing over
six feet of water.
On Tuesday night last, as the Frank
Forrest was backing out from Lookout
landing, she ran on a log that raised her
some eighteen inches, and caused her
detention for eight hours in trying to
get off, but fortunately she was not in
jured severely.
The Mayflower at dark last night had
eight hundred bales of cotton engaged
for New Orleans, half of which was
taken at one dollar and seventy-five
cents per bale, and will probably get
fifteen hundred bales before she goes out
to-night.
Irwin Dugan, master of the Eckert,
came down yesterday to attend to tbe
disposition of some cotton recovered
from the St. Marys, and perhaps went
back last night
The little steamer Bboda, recently
sunk iu the St. Francis river, has beeu
bulkheaded, and will, it is thought, be
raise. I to-day.

The engineer of the H. Clay
Wilson came up from Vieksburg to the
wreck of his boat, on the Mayflower.
When she passed her the Wilson was in
about the same position as when she
went down.
Captains John Wood burn e and Andy
Robinson are, it is said, looking for a
boat to take the place of the St. Marys.
Had the Jennie Howell not met witb
the accident at Ashley's she would have
made two thousand dollars on her last
trip to White river.
The Dardauelle goes to White river
and the Cherokee to the Arkansas to
morrow evening.
Inspectors Clark and Alston left for
Cairo yesterday to examin e a fe w stea m
boats now laid up there.
On Tuesday the R. E. Lee carried into
New Orleans four thousand three hun
dred and thirty-two bales of cotton and
two thousand sacks of seed.
The Continental, Kilgour and City of
Cairo got big trips of sugar at .New Or
leans. It cost the Arkansas Belle twentv-five
huudred dollars to sink a produce boat
in the lower Ohio a few days since.
The Lady Lee came near being de
stroyed by fire about nine o'clock ou
Sunday night last. When approachiug
Bank-tun - Landing, near Paw-Paw, a
fire broke out in the roof, catchiug from
the stovepipe of the ladies' cabin, burn
ing a hole about twelve feet square. A
terrible gale was blowiug at the time,
and but for the prompt exertions of the
officers aud the crew, who soon got the
hose to work, the boat would undoubt
edly have burned to the water's edge,
and the loss of life would have been ter
rible. ADDITIONAL M VKKKTS.
