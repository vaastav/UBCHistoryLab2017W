Scraps and ??cts.
? Birmingham, Ala., December 3: A
practical method of relieving the financial
stringency existing in Birmingham,
Jefferson county, and this
section has been devised by local officials
of the Farmers' Union and will
be put into practice at once. The plan
is for the farmers who desire to borrow
money on their cotton without relinquishing
the title to it to place the staple
In the local warehouse as collateral,
on which the warehouse will issue
notes of hand, or what is popularly
termed "scrip," to the extent of 7 cents
per pound. Practically all of the merchants
doing business in the city have
agreed to accept the scrip at face value
and several of the banks have agreed
to take it as payment for notes held
against merchants. The new plan has
the entire approval of officials of the
Farmers' Union of Alabama.
? Queenstown, December 5: The
Cunard liner Mauretania passed Daunts
Rocks at 5.49 p. m. today, establishing
a new east-bound trans-Atlantic
record. Her time for the voyage from
Sandy Hook, four days, 22 hours and
29 minutes, beats the best time of her
sister ship, the Lusit&nia, by 21 minutes.
The distance covered was 2,807
nautical miles. The Mauretania passed
Sandy Hook lightship at 2.25 p. m.
Saturday, running 490 knots up to noon
on Sunday." The day runs thereafter
were as follows: 548, 535, 556, 554, and
from noon today until the passage of
Daunts Rocks at 124 knots, the average
for the voyage being 23.69. The vessel
behaved splendidly iu the fresh gale
and high flowing sea which she encountered
on Monday, and which continued
until Wednesday night Some
delay was Caused by hazy weather on
the second gjfd'flfth.
? The Washington Jury in the case
of Mrs. Annie M. Bradley, charged with
murder of "fbrmer United Sates Senator
Brown'of Utah, in Washington, on
December 8th last year, on last Tuesday
morning brought in a verdict of
not guilty. The Jury reached the
court room at 10.08. When the court
asked them if they had reached a verdict
the foreman answered: "We have."
"What is your verdict, gentlemen?"
"Not guilty." No demonstration of applause
followed the announcement of
the verdict. Mrs. Bradley was immediately
discharged from custody and
left the court house following an ovation.
She will leave in a few days for
Ooldfleld, Nevada. Throughout its
deliberation the Jury practically stood
at 11 to 1 for acquittal until the final
ballot, when the lone Juror, who was
holding out for some form of punishment,
gave in and the verdict of acquittal
was agreed on.
? The newly appointed house committee
on banking and currency held
lta first meeting last Wednesday,
spending two and- one-half hours in
discussing the currency question in
several of its phases. At the conclusion
of the meeting several members
stated that as a result of the conference
the members of the committee
were now nearer together than they
ever have been before, notwithstanding
the same men?with exception of three
?composed the committee during the
Fifty-ninth congress. The only definite
action taken at this Initial meeting
was the authorizing of the chair to
appoint a sub-committee of five to
draft and submit a currency bill to
correct the present financial situation.
There will be no hearings before the
committee until the sub-committee has
finished its task and the completed
draft is in the hands of the chairman.
The recurrence of two phases of currency
discussion marked the conference.
They were: The creation of
elasticity in the currency and the disposition
of reserve balances in national
banks. The committee was apparently
agreed that it will sanction no move to
increase the bulk of paper money, but
will confine itself to the consideration
of the best means of injecting elasticity.
The plan of providing for the issuance
of national bank credit notes,
which can be instantly drawn into circulation
when general conditions require
an increased currency and retirement
as promptly when the need
has passed, was presented and discussed
at some length. The view was
strongly urged that the laws should be
changed so as to prevent the absorption
of reserve moneys in national banks by
banks in reserve cities. National banks
.are required to hold in reserve cities
.three-fifths of their reserve capital
and it was pointed out that under this
requirement country banks have to
send this reserve portion to the nearest
designated reserve city, whose
banks it was asserted loan it out and
in time of sudden emergency find
.themselves unable to respond to the
.call of the country banks for return of
.the deposits. Several members of the
.committee expressed the opinion that
.the loaning of reserve funds should be
checked by legislation.
? Columbia State, December 4: The
Methodist of the state stood aghast
yesterday when they read the list of
appointments made by Bishop Morrison.
It had been expected that he would
turn things upside down, but no such
disnbirpment and dlsDlacins: was ex
pected as he has made. The clergymen,
many of them, are heartsick, but
cheerful yet In their ways. The lay
members of the denominations are rebellious
In spirit but will go to work
to make the road all the more easy to
be traveled by the weary Itinerants.
There are several Methodist preachers
in Columbia. They returned from conference
yesterday and there were many
visiting preachers here also. They
were almost unanimous in saying that
Bishop Morrison had acted in an arbitrary
manner and had disregarded his
cabinet entirely. One very conservative
Methodist itinerant, or usually he
is conservative, but yesterday he spoke
plainly, said it would be ten years before
the Methodist ministry of the
state could recover from this handing
out of assignments. Fit men had been
removed from positions of trust and
men who have not the qualifications
had been placed in their places. The
denomination has suffered in the exchange.
Bishop Morrison's reputation
had preceded him, but no such radical
.action was dreamed of as that which
he has taken. He stirred up the west
.era North Carolina conrerence lust
week and it was thought that he would
handle the South Carolina conference
vigorously?but he exceeded all expectations
along this line. There are 235
.preachers in conference. He is said to
have moved 150 of them. The average
number is about 75 a year, on the move.
Considerable indignation was felt here
when it was learned that Rev. B. Bas.comb
Browne had been relieved of the
duties of presiding elder of this district
and had been sent to Allendale
as a pastor. "Really it is better for
Mr. Browne." said a brother minister,
yesterday, "for he goes to a congregation
which spares no pains to make a
pastor's life one of comfort and the
-salary is about the same. But the
denomination needs such men as Mr.
Brown* for presiding elder. I do not
know a man better suited for the duties.
He has kept his district up to
the head ever since he was made a
presiding elder nine years ago. He infuses
life and enthusiasm into the
preachers and they do good work for
him. His successor. Rev. J. Walker
Daniel. D. D.. is a good man for presiding
elder, and on the other hand he is
one of the most successful pastors and
one of the best preachers in the south
and it does seem like removing one of
the lights from the pulpit to tie him
down to official duties." After but one
year of work as pastor of Washington
Street Methodist church, Rev. Pierce
F. Kilgo has been made presiding eldei
and assigned to the Florence district.
At first he was assigned to the
Anderson district and Mr. A. J. Cauthen,
another bright young preacher,
was assigned to the Florence district.
They were permitted to exchange assignments
for the reason that each has
Invalided relatives. Mr. Kllgo ha3
made a commendable record In his
brief pastorate here. It usually requires
about a year to get well Into
harness in a large congregation. The
people of his church here are very
*- ? ? T.*" 11 rmr\ Ulo OHO,
mucn Hlltiuilfu iu nu. UH
cessor Is Rev. R. W. Bays, who Is regarded
as one of the most attractive
preachers in the conference. Mr. Bays
has no family except Mrs. Bays, who
will be welcomed to Columbia. They
have three married daughters in Rock
Hill. There was general rejoicing
when it was learned that Bishop Morrison
had overlooked Rev. B. R. Turnipseed
and had left him here. Not
only at Green Street church but
throughout the city is Mr. Turnlpseed
a favorite. Rev. A. N. Brunson, another
preacher who is very much admired
for his manliness and his good
work, has been returned to Main Street
church.

YORKVILLE, S. C.t
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1907.
Tub Yorkvllle Enquirer asks us why
northern commission men make a difference
of from half a cent to one cent
a pound in the price of northern and
southern yarns, to the disadvantage of
the latter. We have not studied that
subject, and can not speak with assurance,
but it is not unlikely that southern
yam makers are "skinned" because
they are not independent If the
northern commission men are not
stockholders in the mills they represent
in the south, or do not control the
sources from which southern mills secure
their money in the north, the
southern mills would not likely submit
to the robbery that The Enquirer alleges.
If the grades are the same it is
robbery. The remedy, if our supposition
is well founded, is for those mills
with sufficient financial independence
to do so, to organize for self-dependence
and force a square deal; and for those
hampered by northern commission men
that use their financial interests to ex'ort
unreasonable commissions, to get
southern money to buy out the northern
interests. But this is a great big
subject, and both sides of the case
hould be presented by experts in order
that a fair understanding may be
reached.?Columbia State.
No, we have not alleged any "robbery."
We have merely stated that our
northern commission friends, buy
southern yarns of exactly the same
?rade and quality at from one-half to
one cent a pound less than eastern
yarns. It is not a matter of mere al'egatlon.
but a matter of fact It is
done openly and unblushingly. The
textile Journals make the quotations.
We can furnish the testimony of southern
spinners to the effect that the custom
is an established rule. If there is
any difference in quality, northern experts
cannot tell it. We have the testimony
of a southern mill man who was
3mart enough to perfect an arrangement
whereby he had his yams marketed
as "eastern" made, and got the
"eastern" price. In order to do this it
was necessary to so manage that the
origin of the goods could not be estab.ished
by the purchaser. It is a fact
*Un + nil eAiitUarn mlllo CAmbtlmfiQ CA t
uiai an avuuiviu tititia 9v**?wk..MVH o
"eastern" prices; but It Is generally In
flush times and on hurry orders. We
know of some southern mills that are
operated entirely on southern money,
and they are In the same boat with the
others. We have been told also that
until a few years ago it was next to
impossible for a southern mill to get
Insurance rates on as favorable a basis
as eastern mills, regardless of the surrounding
physical conditions. This
has been changed somewhat. Yes, we
are quite well aware that a great big
subject is involved; but we don't
think that there is much question
among the southern mill men as to the
merits of the case. The only explanation
we have to offer Is the belief we
have already advanced, the disposition,
the well established policy, of our eastern
friends to discriminate against the
south in any and everything where
discrimination Is possible. And in its
suggestion with reference to the control
of the sources from which the
southern mills get their money, the
State gives an intimation that if it
would go into the matter a little deeper
it would come to the same conclusion.
He Saved the Situation.
During the late "panic," so-called,
the farmer has been the one man who
was not stampeded. When the confidence
of business men was shaky, when
they sacrificed their securities and
money was tight everywhere, the farmer
serenely held his cotton. He Is
holding It now. A sufficient number of
bales were sold to enable southern
banks and business to move along
without serious inconvenience, but the
independence of the farmer during the
emergency has been what the business
of the south has leaned upon. When
the price of cotton went to ten cents,
the farmers held the more firmly. Had
they lost faith as did financiers in the
great centres In their securities, and
unloaded their cotton, the market
would have gone to smash, prices
dropping to seven or eight cents. That
the price has been maintained In an
emergency when alarm among all other
branches of trade and industry was
the feature of the situation Is a remarkable
demonstration of the southern
farmer's sturdy character and substantial
strength.
The foregoing credited to an Orangeburg
business man and the subject
of an able editorial in The News
and Courier of yesterday, Is the most
lovoi.hpadpri comprehension of the
crisi* through which the country Is
passing that has come to our notice.
Whatever may have been the cause
of the "currency strike," whether over
speculation, whether a slap back at
the administration, whether a counter
attack on the holding movement, or
whether only a coincidence, there Is
no question of its tremendous effect on
business interests of every kind, and
that the country has had a narrow escape
from widespread disaster.
We do not think that anybody will
question the proposition that If there
had been a break In the holding movement
when the situation was at Its
worst, prices would have gone tumbling.
It almost makes one shiver to
consider It. With currency commanding
a premium of 6 per cent and the
banks not only of New York, but of
the entire country shaky because of
general runs. If there had been a stampede
among the fanners, it would have
hardly been stopped until cotton had
actually become a drug on the market.
As It is, business has only suffered a
partial paralysis. Merchants have not
been able to sell their stocks as rapidly
as they hoped, and creditors have
had to wait for their money. This has
been a matter of much inconvenience
to both. Many have chafed under the
situation, as has been most natural.
Some perhaps, have Indulged In impatient
criticism, and even this is excus
able. But people who are accustomed ]
to try to view the situation soberly and
accept facts as they stand, are able to
very clearly see that If the farmer had p
become panicky and let go his holdings
at the time referred to, smashing the
bottom out of prices, the returns from G
his crop would not have been sufficient ^
to pay his debtq. He would have had
no surplus with which to buy dry *
goods, and the business paralysis would
have even been more severe than has
yet been experienced. H
And this Is not all. The mill people
tell us that for weeks past they j
have been storing the greater part of
their products against the time when
they can realize fair prices. If the cot- -j
ton market had gone down in demoralization,
the yarn market would have E
been bound to have followed at least to _
T
a certain extent, and not only would
there have been heavy present losses;
but It would have been months if not
vears before the recent high levels J
could have been again attained.
There Is yet more to the story. In
its editorial, The News and Courier
calls attention to the fact that while q
the southern mills may have difficulty
In getting the money with which to lay S
In supplies of cotton ahead, unlike the
spinners of New England and Europe, l
they have comfort In the fact that the
farmers are holding it for them right
at their doors. To all Intents and
purposes the farmer is not only upholding
the value of mill products; but he V
Is financing the mills by holding for
them cotton that they are unable to
buy and hold for themselves. 1 A(
In view of this situation which Is
fair and Just throughout, we submit ^
that If there Is any disposition to reproach
the farmer on account of his
stand, such disposition is founded on ^
very poor grace. As a matter of fact,
most of the broadest and best business
men we know, even though some of T
them have been pfftty severely pinched,
see the situation Just as we have
outlined It, and Instead of dealing In
reproach they have nothing but praise.
What may come, of course they do not
know; but If It Is misfortune the farmer
Is not to blame. If It Is complete F
victory, the farmer and those who have
stood by him. are entitled to all the
credit
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. q
a:
Summary of Document Read to Con- o:
gross last i uoiaay.
The annual message of President ^
Theodore Roosevelt, read last Tuesday bi
before the joint session of both houses ei
of the Sixtieth United States congress,
P
contains thirty thousand words, and Is
summarized by the Atlanta Journal as ti
follows: tl
The president recommends Federal 01
licenses or national charters for cor- n
poratlons.
He recommends that any revision "
of the tariff be postponed at least un- c:
til after the election.
He proposes that the congress appro- tl
priate money necessary to defray the ti
expenses of the leading national parties ti
In presidential elections. tl
Of most vital Importance from the a!
viewpoint of the president Is the re- tl
cent financial depression or stringency, fc
pointing to the moral lesson of purga- tl
tion of dishonest business methods. ai
The author of the message urges n
prompt action as to a definite currency 01
plan, though the mlnutla of the propo- k;
sltion receives no tangible suggestion
from the president <j
Relative to the currency plan, how- n
ever, the president suggests that It b
must be of sufficient elasticity to ena- u
ble its speedy retirement after the
financial stringency be passed. tl
The president follows his previous a;
declarations as to railroads and oor- fl
poratlons. advocating all the publicity p
possible In regard to the Inside work- 0j
ings of giant corporations throughout C1
the country. t(
He lmphatlcally urged Federal Inoor- .,
poration or conditional licenses, which, h
together with a wholesome govern- n
mental supervision, he believes would S)
prevent a great deal of dishonesty a|
which has been prevalent in the paBt a
In the various channels of business and jr
trade. ol
The present tariff system, the pres- p
ident says, Is responsible for the excel- e|
lent balance which prevails between r|
our expenditures and Income, pointing fi
with pride to the yearly average of t)
$31,000,000. b
He 1b of the opinion that the tariff C]
system should be given careful scru- S(
tiny to prevent any tendency to grow- g
ing abuses in the administration of 0(
this important feature or tne govern- jt
ment.
The president Is heartily in favor of
in income tax, though he says hs
speaks with reverence due to the contrary
decision of the United Btates
supreme court on the subject. v
It is the opinion of the president that
recent prosecutions have successfully it
denied the old reasons given that It had Y
^een impossible to punish dishonesty
where the guilty were men of great S)
wealth. tj
In discussing railroad accidents the
nresldent declares that more people are N
being killed on the great steam high- f;
ways of the country than are claimed
in the wars of the world. He urges
hat the Federal government lnvestl- s
igate railroad accidents. w
The lessons learned from his recent N
lourney down the Mississippi river are
pointed to as being reason enough for n
'he country to pay particular attention tl
to the development of its Interior wa- S
terways. le
Employers' liability, western land
frauds, savings bank system and many p
->ther matters of especial Interest to the a
mibllc welfare are dealt with at con- g|
?lderable length in the message. Of jr
more than passing Interest is his recommendation
that fourth-class postmasters
be placed under civil service.
Citizenship to the people of Porto
rtico is suggested: an ocean mall subsidy
to the far east is discussed at
'"ngth: The Hague conference is re- u
viewed along with the announcement 01
hat the exnosltlon in Japan in 1912 a
will afford the United States a magnif- w
Icent opportunity which he hopes to tl
see Improved: the tariff agreement, re- o'
"ently extended by Germany, is made n
he subject of serious remarks. ei

? Capt. John H. Fitzpatrick, a former rj
"itizen of Lancaster: but for the past p
t<m years a resident of Washington, ~
Ga? died suddenly in Lancaster on last \
Wednesday.
? Soartanburg special of December 4, jr
to the News and Courier: There Is a n
lively war on between cotton buyers for ^
he cotton mills and Dunbar Bros., who ^
ore buying for an export firm. Dun- S(
bar Bros., entered the cotton market j
several days ago. Since then there has a
been a big advance in the price of lo- 0
cal cotton. The high water mark was
reached today, when cotton Jumped to 0
11.30c before noon. Much cotton was ^
brought to the city and the streets, ^
crowded with wagons loaded with cot- ^
ton. presented a lively scene. The y
buyers for the cotton mills were very e\
active the entire day. Dunbar Bros., ^
bought the majority of the staple offer- p
ed here. Much of the cotton Is being a
shipped to New York. c,
? Columbia State: It Is possible that rr
the clearinghouse association will In a n
few days begin to redeem some of the r<
certificates Issued recently, the ones It
which have been mutilated In one way cl
and another. The life of the certi- u
ficates, unless the whole Issue should
be called In within that time, Is until w
March 1, next. However, the job of b
printing was very poor and the certl- t(
ficates are beginning to show wear al- b
ready. There are two or three prln- g
teries In Columbia who could have giv- tl
en a better job of printing, but It was tl
deemed necessary to send the work to t(
an out of the state establishment for 01
purposes of further protection. The d
Atlanta house which did the printing h
charged $1,500 for the job and at that tl
used a quality of paper which would oi
have been costly at the very lowest ai
prices. It has not been decided wheth- cl
er to issue duplicate certificates in
place of the ones which are wearing w
out or merely to cancel and redeem bi
with currency. a

r iresne recently, r rienas ana rem.- a

eople are very much mystified. 0
From the way we got the lnforma- *
on we do not (eel warranted in men- 's
oning any names; but we know of
ne York county cotton mill that right
ow has a cash surplus of nearly thirr
thousand dollars, and whloh has not
le slightest idea of shutting down, ex- 8]
scept on Sundays. g
Because of the hard times north,
tere is an unusual migration of v
amps southward this winter. The ,t
amps are coming this way by the ?(
lousand. These vagrants are gener- ^
lly no good, of course, and more often
lan otherwise they are on the lookout
)r whatever they can steal. Among j5
lem are men who will not hesitate at '*
ny crime whatever. Every oommuIty
should have some adequate means "
t protection against people of this a
ind. ^
We have noted a few expressions of l'
issatisfaction at the appointments
lade by Bishop Morrison at Gaffney;
ut about the strongest is that repub- s<
shed in another column from the Co- v
imbla State. With so many changes n
iroughout the state, It Is quite natur- ft
I that there should be many dlssatls- y.
ed people. In some cases it is the si
reachers who are dissatisfied and in tl
ther cases it is the people. It is the Ir
ustom of the good Methodist, however, cl
) school himself or herself to be o|
leased with whatever comes, and ci
owever'he or she may feel, it is the p
ule to make no outward show of dis- tc
itisfaction. So far as we have been tl
ble to learn, the people of this section
re simply delighted with the manner .j
i which Bishop Morrison has handed
ut his appointments. They think that
;ev. R. E. Staokhouse, the presiding h
Ider of the Rock Hill district, is the ;
ght man In the right plaoe, and the J*
ict that he was retained in his poslon
is taken as evidence that the

'ere estimated at 500,00.
The market, opened steady at an adance
of 1 to 5 points on covering but
ulckly eased off owing to dlsappointlg
Liverpool advices and local bear
ressure which was probably promoted
y the reported failure of a large Kanas
City bank. There was also active

Local bulls came to the support of

by renewed steadiness at the

very firm showing, sales being re- i

The Medical Association.
Rock Hill Record: The York County
Medical association met at this place
Tuesday morning at 11 o'clock In the
Commercial Club rooms, and elected
the following officers for the new year:
Dr. J. R. Miller of this city, president;
Dr. W. M. Love of McConnelsvIlle, vice
president; Dr. E. W. Pressly of Clover,
secretary; Dr. I. A. Bigger of this city,
delegate to the state convention. Quite
a lengthy and live discussion was had
on scarlatina, which seems to be prevalent
over the country at this time,
and a most able and Interesting address
was made by Dr. Presslev of Clover.
on sanitary conditions. The association
was so much Impressed with
the address of Dr. Pressley on this
subject that they have asked him to
deliver It in nubile In the near future.
Mr. J. T. Wilkereon's Barn Burned.
A larirA hnrn holnnclnir tn Mr .T TV
Wllkerson, who lives about two mllea
from Broad river In Broad River township
was destroyed by fire at an early
hour last Wednesday morning. When
Mr. Wllkerson discovered the fire the
roof was falling In and It was too late
to do anything to arrest the progress
of the flames. He got there In time,
however to save a saddle horse,
which, was pretty severely scorched.
The loss aggregates something like
$2,500 and Includes five fine mules
worth not less than $200 each. All of
the contents of the barn, including a
lot of provender went up In smoke.
Vehicles, implements, harness, etc.,
were Included In the destruction. The
mules were Insured In the Farmers'
Mutual Live-Stock Insurance company,
D. E. Boney agent, for $100 each,
and there was also some Insurance on
the building; but considerable additions
had been made since the writing
of the policy and the Insurance was
not adequate. There Is no reason to
suppose otherwise than that the fire
was of incendiary origin. On learning
that suspicion rested on a negro
named Jake Daniel, alias Jake Robinson,
Solicitor Henry Instructed Sheriff
Brown to cause the negro's arrest.

Train Rocker Captured.
Charlotte Observer, Wednesday:
Were all officers of the law as fleet
of foot and as long of wind as Cgpt.
H. Y. Jones, the popular conductor
an the Southern railway, there might
be fewer criminals unjailed and unhung.
No better witness to the swiftness
of the one and the endurance of
the other could be produced than a
svhlte man, name unknown, who lies
In the Jail at Blacksburg, S. C., awaiting
trial on a serious charge. This
man will think twice and maybe three
times before he again takes occasion
to hurl a rock through a window of
2apt. Jones's train. It happened after
this fashion. Yesterday afternoon Captain
Jones was bringing No. 13 from
Atlanta to Charlotte. At 4-35 o'clock,
lust as the train was slowing down to
cross the bridge across Broad river,
nouth of Blacksburg, S. C., where bridge
construction work was being done, a
rock crashed through the window of
the first-class passenger coach. Instantly
the conductor rang down the
engineer and when the train came to
i stop, accompanied by several others,
le made a dash for the man who did
the deed. He saw him make a break
to run, and run he did, but in like
manner the trainman and passengers
ilso ran. Through woods for the most
?art, among tangled bushes and shrubbery,
up hill, down hjll, the party flew,

dear to the heart of the hunter,
Vs stated, the aggregation went down
in Monday. Everything went smooth- 1
y during the first and second day, <
>ird8, squirrels and other game being
tilled In sufficient numbers to meet
heir demands. On Wednesday mornng,
according to Meek and Willie
smith, and we are satisfied that George
dcCall and Dan Wright will confirm
heir statement, they left the lodge in
harge of Little Andy and set out for
he biggest day's sport yet. They had
inly been gone a short while, but long
enough for George McCall and Dan
.Vright to waste about five shots beween
them in trying to kill two birds,
rhen Meek Smith looked back?he beng
prone to do that?and noticed a
ieavy column of smoke in the direction
if the lodge, and he at once sung out J
hat "the shanty" was on fire. Every- '
lody made a bee line for it and when 1
hey reached there it was found that '
he "shanty" was almost gone together '
ilth everything It contained, including 1
ne complete gun, a suit case, a suit of J
lew clothes and other property belongng
to Dan Wright, two extra gun barels?one
set belonging to Willie Smith
nd the other to Geo. McCall, and the ^
itter's watch, four overcoats, beds and
ledding, sleeping bags, cooking stove
nd utensils and about 400 loaded
hells. The cause of the fire is not
;nown, but is supposed to have orlgi- |
ated with a kerosene cooking stove, j
Little Andy was away when the fire
started having left for a neighboring
house to have some bread cooked for
dinner, but he Insists that he cut off
the oil before leaving, A phone message
was sent here asking Andy Quinn
to send a hack at once, but no explanation
made, and the cause of the sudden
change of plans was not known
until the aggregation lit here, wearing
their hunting suits and practically
without protection from the weather,
The total loss Is estimated at from >300
to >400. It is likely that a new lodge
will be erected Just as soon as the necessary
material can be gotten together,
It has been definitely decided that
Clover Is to Jiave a standard cotton
warehouse. Tne present intention is
that it shall be of about 1,000 bales capacity
and be ready for business by th
opening of the next season.
The matter of erecting a cotton seed
oil mill is being considered to some extent
by citizens who are likely to push
the matter through and also have it
ready for business by next fall. Clover
is a large shipper of seed and the
Idea is to keep the seed at home and
consequently whatever profit there may
be in the oil, meal and hulls, besides
the great convenience of the institution
for users of seed products in this
section.
The statement published in The Enquirer
on Tuesday relative to the annual
payroll of the Clover Manufacturing
companv. which gave the amount
as being $250,000, was incorrect The
?xact amount paid out in wages foi
the year ending December 31, 1906, was
$74,574.74. Owing to the fact that
right work has been cut out the payroll
for 1907 has been averaging about
T5 000 per month.
The mill is being operated full time
and there is no thought of closing
down, even for part time. While some
->f the product is being sold much is
being stored.
Business here has not been seriously
affected by the so-called panic. The
Bank of Clover has been able to take
good care of its customers and is pay ng
for what cotton is being sold with
currency.
The Clover Ginnery has tinned about
1 550 bales so far this season. Mr. W
*5. Adams, the manager does not thinh
that the record of last year?something
over 1,800 bales, will be equalled. .
Since his return from Baltimore,
