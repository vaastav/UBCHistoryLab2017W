TBE ROSABV OF MY YEARS.
BY FATHER EVA..
Some reckon their age by years,
Some measure their life by art—
But some tell their dayj by the flow of their
tears,
And their life by the moans of their heart.
The dials of earth may show
The length, not the depth, or years,
Few or many they come—few or many they
go-
But our time is best measured by tears.
Ah! not by the silver gray
That creeps through tho sunny hair.
And not by the scenes that we pass on our
way—
And not by tbe furrows the finger ot care
On the forehead and face have made;
Not so do we count our years;
Not by the sun of the earth—but the shade
Of our souls—and the fall of our tears.
Fo? the young are ofttimes old.
Though their brow be bilght and fair;
While their blood beats warm, their heart lies
cold—
Not o'er them the spring-time-hut winter ls
there.
And the old are ofttimes young.
When their hair is thin and white;
And they sing in age as in youth they sung,
And they laugh, for their cross was light.
But bead by bead I tell
The rosary of my years ;
From a cross to a cross they lead—'tis well!
And they're blessed with a blessing of tears.
Better a day of strife
Than a century of sleep;
Give me instead ot a long stream of life.
The tempest and tears of the deep.
A thousand joys may foam
On the billows of all the years;
But never the foam brings the brave bark
home:
It reaches the haven through tears.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAUE. •
Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and
House of Representatives: —Our heart
felt gratitude is due to the Divine Being,
who holds in His hands the destinies of
nations, for the continued bestowal, dur
ing the last year, of countless blessings
upon our country.
We are at peace with all other nations
Our public credit has greatly improved,
and is, perhaps, now stronger thau ever
before. Abundant harvests nave re
warded the labors of those who till the
soil, our manufacturing industries are
reviving, and it is believed that general
prosperity, which has been so long anx
iously looked for, is at last within our
reach.
The enjoyment of health by our peo
ple generally, has, however, been inter
rupted, during the past season, by the
prevalence ofa fatal pestilence, the yel
low fever, in some portions of the south
ern States, creating an emergency which
called for prompt and extraordinary
measures of relief. Tbe disease appear
ed as an epidemic at New Orleans and
at other places on the lower Mississippi,
soon'after mid-summer. It was rapidly
spread by fugitives from the infected
cities and towns, and did not disappear
until early, in November. The States of
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee
have suffered severely. About onehun
dred thousand cases are believed to have
occurred, of which about twenty thou
sand, according to intelligent estimates,
proved fatal. It is impossible to esti
mate with any approach to accuracy the
ioss to the country occasioned by this
epidemic. It is to lie reckoned by the
hundred millions of dollars. The suffer
ing and destitution that resulted, excit
ed the deepest sympathy in all parts of
the Union. Physicians and nurses has
tened from every quarter to the assis
tance of the afflicted communities.—
Voluntary contributions of money and
supplies in every needed form, were
speedily and generously furnished. The
Government, was able to respond in some
measure to tiie call for help, by provid
ing tents, medicines, and food for the
sick and destitute, ihe requisite direc
tions for the purpose being given, in the
confident expectation that this action of
the Executive would receive the sanc
tion of Congress. About eighteen hun
dred tents, and ralions of tiie value of
about twenty-five thousand dollars, were
sent to cities and towns which applied
for them, full details of which will be
furnished to Congress by the proper Da
parlment.
The fearful spread of this pestilence,
has awakened a very general publicsen
timent in favor of national sanitary ad
ministration, which shall not only con
trol quarantine, but have the sanitary
supervision of internal commerce iv
times of epidemics, and hold an advisory
relation to tiie State and municipal
health authorities, with power to deal
with whatever endangers the public
health, and which the municipal and
State authorities are unable to regulate.
The national quarantine act approved
April 29, 187S, which was passed 100 late
iv the last session of Congress to provide
the means for carrying it into practical
operation, during the past season, is a
step in the direction here indicated. In
view ofthe necessity for the most effec
tive measures, by quarantine and other
wise, for the protection of our seaports,
and the country generally from this and
other epidemics, it is recommended that
Congress give to Ihe whole subject early
and careful consideration.
The permanent pacification of the
country by the complete protection of
ail citizens iv every civil aud political
right continues to be of paramount in
terest with tbe great body of our people.
Every step in this direciion in welcom
ed with public approval, and every in
terruption of steady and uniform pro
gress to the desired consummation
awakens general uneasiness and wide
spread condemnation. The recent Con
gressional elections have furnished a di
rect and trustworthy test of the advance
thus far made ia the practical establish
ment of the right of suffrage, secured by
the Constitution to the liberated race in
the southern States. All disturbing in
fluences, real or imaginary, had been
removed from all of these States.
Tbe three constitutional amendments,
which conferred freedom and equality
of civil and political rights upon the col
ored people of the South, were adopted
by the concurrent action of the great
body of good citizens who maintained
the authority of the National Govern
ment and the integrity and perpetuity
of the Union at such a cost of treasure
and life, as a wise and necessary em
bodiment in the organic law of the just
results ofthe war. The people of the
former slave-holding States accepted
these results, and gave, in every prac
ticable form, assurances that the thir
teenth, fourteenth and fifteenth amend
ments, and laws passed in pursuance
thereof, should, in good faith, be enforc
ed, rigidly and impartially, inletterand
spirit, to the end that the humblest citi
zen, without distinction of race or color,
should, under them, receive full and
equal protection in person and property
and in political rights and privileges.—
By these constitutional amendments,
the southern section of the Union ob
tained alarge increase of political power
in Congress aud in tbe Electoral Col
lege, and the country justly expected
that elections would proceed, a3 to the
francliised race, upon the same circum
stances of legal and constitutional free
dom and protection which obtained in
all the other States of the Union. The
friends of law and order looked forward
to the conduct of those elections, as of
fering to tbe general judgment of the
country an important opportunity to
measure the degree in which the right
of suffr.ge could be exercised by the
colored people, and would be respected
by their fellow-citizens ; hut a more gen
eral enjoyment of freedom of suffrage by
the colored people, and a more just and
generoKWprotection of that freedom by
the communities of which they form a
part, were generally anticipated than
the record of the elections discloses. In
some of those States in which the color
ed people have been unable to make
their opinions fe.'t in the elections, the
result is mainly due to influences not
easily measured or remedied by legal
protection ; but in the Status of Louisi
ana and South Carolina at larpe, and in
some particular congressional districts
outside of those States, the records of the
elections seem to compel the conclusion
that the rights of the colored voters have
been overridden, and their participation
in the elections not permitted to be cith
er general or free.
It will be for the Congress for which
these elections were held to make such
examinations into their conduct as may
be appropriate to determine the validity
of the claims of members to their seats.
In the meanwhile it becomes the duty
ofthe Executive and Judicial Depart
nieuts of the Government, each iv its
province, to inquire into and punish
violations of the laws of the United
States which have occurred. I can but
repeat what I said in this connection in
my last message, that whatever author
ity rests with me to this end I shall not
hesitate to put forth, and I am unwill
ing to forego a renewed appeal to the
legislatures, the courts, the executive
authorities, and the people ofthe States
where these wrongs have been perpetrat
ed, to give their assistance towards
bringing to justicetheolTendersand pre
venting a repetition of the crimes. No
means within my power will be spared
to obtain a full and fair investigation of
the alleged crimes, and to secure the
conviction and just punishment of the
guilty.
It is to be observed that Ihe principal
appropriation made for the Department
of Justfce at the last session contained
the following clause: "And for defray
ing the expenses which may be incurred
in the enforcement of the act approved
February 28, 1871, entitled 'An act to
amend an act approved May 30, 1870,
entitled an act to enforce the rights of
citizens of the United States to vote in
the several States of the Union, and for
other purposes,' or any acts amendatory
thereof or supplementary thereto."
It is the opinion of the Attorney Gen
eral that tbe expenses of these proceed
ings will largely exceed the amount
which was thus provided, and I rely
confidently upon Congress to make ad
equate appropriations to enable the Ex
ecutive Department to enforce the laws.
I respectfully urge upon your attention
that the congressional elections, in cv
cry district, iti a very important sense,
arejustly a matter of political iutertst
and concern throughout the whole coun
try. Each State, every political party,
is entitled to the share of power which
is conferred by the legal and constitu
tional suffrage. It is the right of every
citizen, possessing the qualifications
prescribed by law, to cast one uniiitimi
dateti ballot, and to have his ballot lion
estly counted. So loog as the exercise
of this power and Ihe enjoyment of this
right ate common and equal, practical
ly as well as formally, submission to the
results of the suffrage will be accorded
loyally aud cheerfully, and all the de
partments of Government will feel the
true vigor of tbe popular will thus ex
pressed. _N T o temporary or administra
tive interests of Government, however
urgent or weighty, will ever displace the
zeal of our people in defence of tl c
primary rights of citizenship. They un
derstand that the protection of liberty
requires the maintenance, in full vigor,
of Ihe nianhjoiethodsof free speech, free
press, and free •suffrage, and will sustain
the full authority of Government to en
force the laws Which are framed to pre
serve these inestimable lights. The
material progress and welfare of the
State depend on the protection afforded
to their citizens. There can be no peace
without such protection, do prosperity
without peace, and the whole country is
deeply interested in the growth and
prosperity ol ali its parts.
While the country Inn not yt-t reach
ed complete unity of feeling and recip
rocal confidence between the communi
ties so lately and so seriously estranged,
I feel ami absolute assurance that the
tendencies are in that direction, and
with increasing force. Tbe power of
public opinion will override all political
prejudices, and all sectional or S f ate at
tadiintents, in demanding that all over
our wide territory the name andcharac
ter of citizen of the United States shall
mean one and the same thing and carry
with them unchallenged security and
respect.
Our relations with other countries con
tinue peaceful. Our neutrality in con
tests between foreign powers has been
maintained and .espected.
The Universal Exposition held at
Paris during the past summer has been
attended by large numbers of our citi
zens. The brief period allowed for the
preparation and arrangement of the
contributions of ourcitizens to this great
Exposition was well employed in ener
getic and judicious efforts to overcome
this disadvantage. These efforts, led
and directed by the Commissioner Gen
eral, were remarkably successful, and
the exhibition of the products of Ameri
can industry was oreditableand gratify
ing in scope and character. The reports
of the United States commissioners, giv
ing its results in detail, will he duly laid
before you. Our participation in this
international competition for the favor
and the trade of the world may he ex
pected to produce useful and important
results, in promoting intercourse, friend
ship, and commerce with other nations.
ln accordance with the provisions of
the act of February 28, 1878, three com
missioners were appointed to an inter
national conference on the subject of
adopting a common ratio between gold
and silver,for the purpose of establishing
internationally the use of hi-metallic
money, and securing fixity of relative
value between those metals.
luvitations were addressed to the vari
ous Governments which had expressed
a willingness to participate in its deli
berations. The conference held its meet
ings in Paris in August last. The report
ofthe commissioners, herewith submit
ted, will show its results. No common
ratio between geld and silver could be
agreed upon by the conference. The
general conclusion was reached that it
is necessary to maintain iv the world
the monetary functions of silver as well
as of gold, leaving the selection of the
use of one or the other of these two met
als, or of both, to be made by each State.
Congress having appropriated at its
last session the sum of $5,500,000 to pay
the award of the Joint Commission at
Halifax, if, after correspondence with
the British Government, on the subject
of the conformity of the award to
to the requirements of the treaty
and to the terms of the question
thereby submitted to the Commis
sion, the President shall deem it his duty
to make the payment, communications
upon those points were addressed to the
British Government through the lega
tion of the United States at London.—
Failiug to obtain the concurrence of the
British Government in the views of this
Government respecting the award, I
have, deemed it my duty to tender tiie
sum-named, within the year fixed by
the treaty, accompanied by a notice of
the grounds ofthe payment, and a pro
test against any other construction of
the same. The correspondence upon
this subject will be laid before you.
The Spanish Government has official
ly announced the termination ofthe in-
STAUNTON, VA., TUESDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1878.
surrection in Cuba, and tho restoration
of peace throughout that island. Con
fident expectations are expressed of a
revival of trade and prosperity, which it
Is earnestly hoped may prove well
founded. Numerous claims of Ameri
can, citizens for relief for injuries or re
storation of property have been among
the incidents ofthe long continued hos
tilities. Some of these claims are in
process of adjustment by Bpain, and the
others are promised early and careful
consideration.
The treaty made with Italy, in regard
to reciprocal consular privileges, has
been duly ratified and proclaimed.
No questions of grave importance have
arisen with any other of tho European
powers.
The Japanese Governm«int has been
desirous ofa revision of such parts of its
treaties with foreign powers as relate to
commerce, and, itis understood, has ad
dressed to each of the treaty powers a
request to open negotiations with that
view. The United States Government
has been inclined to regard the matter
favorably. Whatever restrictions upon
trade with Japan are found injurious to
that people cannot but affect injuriously
nations holding commercial intercourse
with them. Japan, after a long period
of seclusion, has within the past few
years made rapid strides in the path of
enlightenment and progress, and not un
reasonably, is looking forward to the
time when her relations with the nations
of Europe and America shall be assimi
lated to those which they hold with each
other. A treaty looking to this end hag
been made, which will be .nbmitied for
the consideration ofthe Senate.
After an interval of several years, the
Chinese Government has again sent
envoys to the United States. They
have been received, and a permanent
legation is now established here by that
Government. It is not doubted that
this step will be of advantage to both
nations in promoting friendly relations
and removing causes of difference. The
treaty with the Samoan Islands, having
peeii duly ratified and accepted on the
part of both Governments, is now in
operation, and a survey and soundings
of the harbor of Pago Pago have been
made by a naval vessel of the United
States, with a view of its occupation as
a naval station, if found desirable to the
service.
Since the resumption of diplomatic
relations with Mexico, correspondence
has been opened and still continues be
tween the two Governments upon the
various questions which at one time
seemed to endanger their relations —
While no formal agreement has been
reached as to the troubles on the border,
much has been done to repress and di
minish them. The effective force of the
United Btates troops on the Rio Grande,
by a strict and faithful compliance with
instructions, has done much to remove
the sources of dispute, and it is now un
derstood that a like force of Mexican
troops on the other side of the river is
also making an energetic movement
against the marauding Indian tribes.—
This Government looks with the great
est satisfaction upon every evidence of
strength in the national' authority of
Mexico, and upon every effort put forth
to prevent or to punish incursions upon
our territory. Reluctant to assume any
action or attitude in the control of these
incursions, by military movements
across the border, not imperatively de
manded for the protection of the lives
and property of our own citizens, I
shall take the earliest opportunity, con
sistent with the proper discharge of this
plain duty, to recoguizn Hie ability of
the Mexican Government to restrain
effectively violations of our territory.--
It i 3 proposed to hold next year an In
ternational Exhibition in Mexico, and
it is believed that the display of the ag
rioultural and manufacturing products
of the two nations will tend to better
understanding and inerea-e.l commer
cial intercourse between their people.
With Bra.il, aud the Republics of
Central and South America, some steps
have been taken toward Ihe develop
ment of closer commercial intercourse.
Diplomatic relations have b.en resumed
with Colombia and with Bolivia. A
boundary question between the Argen
tine Republic and Paraguay has been
submitted by those Governments for ar
bitration to the President of the United
States, and I have, after careful exami
nation, given a decision upon it.
A naval expedition up the Amazon
and Madeira rivers lias brought back in
formation valuable both for scientific
and commercial purposes. A like expe
dition is about visiting the coast of Af-.
Rica and the Indian ocean. The reports
of diplomatic and consular officers in
relation to the development of our for
eign commerce have furnished many
facts that have proved of public interest,
and have stimulated to practical exer
tion the enterprise of our people.
The report of the Secretary of the
Treasury furnishes a detailed statement
of the operation of that department of
the Government, and of the condition
of the public finances.
The ordinary revenues from all sources
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1877,
were $257,763,878.70; the ordinary ex
penditures for the same period were
$236,964.326.50-leavinga surplus reve
nue for the year of $_8,79.._51.96.
The receipts for the present fiscal year
ending June 30, 1879, actual au estimat
ed, are as follows: Actual receipts for
the first quarter, commencing July 1,
1878, $73,389,743 43; estimated receipts
for the remaining three-quarters of the
year, $191,110,256.57; total receipts for
the current fiscal year, actual and esti
mated, $264,500,000 The expenditures
for the same period will be, actual aud
estimated, as follows: For the quarter
commencing July 1, 1878, actual expen
ditures, $73,344,573 27; and for the re
maining three-quarters of the year the
expenditures are estimate.! at $166,755,
426.73; making the total expenditures,
$240,100,000 ; and leaving an estimated
surplus revenue for the year, ending
June 30, 1879, of $24,400,000.
The total receipts during the next fis
cal year, ending June 30, 1880, esti
mated according to existing laws,
will be $264,500 000; and the estimated
ordinary expenditures, for the same pe
riod will be $236,320.412.05, leaving a
sarplus of $28,179,587.32 for that year.
In the foregoing statements of expen
ditures, actual and estimated, no
amount is allowed for the sinking fund
provided for by tiie act approved Feb
ruary 25, 1862, which requires that one
per cent, of the entire debt of the Unit
ed States shall be purchased or paid
within each fiscal year, to be set apart'
as a sinking fund. There has been, 1
however, a substantial compliance with
the'conditions of the law. By itsterms,
the public debt should have been re
dueed between 1802 and the clme of the
lust fiscal year, $518,361,806 28; the ac
tual reduction of the ascertained debt,
in that period, has been $720,644,739.61:
being iv excess of the reduction required
by the sinking fund : ct—5202,282,933.33.
The am* wit of public debt, le=s cash
in tho Treasury, November I, 1878, was
$2,024 200.083.18—a reduction, since the
same date last year, cf $23,150,617.39.
The progress inai.'e during the last
year, in refunding the public debt at
lower rates of in ten st, is very gratify
ing. The amount of four par cent,
bond* sold during the present year prior
to November 23, IS7B, is $100,270,900,
and six per cent, bonds, commonly
known as five twentiis, to an equal
amount, have br-.n or will be redeemed
as calls mature.
It has be?n the policy ofthe Depart
ment to place the four per cent, bonds
within cay reach of cvi ry citizen who
desires to invest his swings, whether
small or great, in these securities. The
Secretary of the Treasury recommends
that the law be so modified that small
, sums may be invested, and that through
tbe postoffices, or other agents ofthe
Government, the freest opportunity may
be given in all parts of the country for
such investments.
The best mode suggested is, that the
Department be authorized to issue cer
tificates of deposit of the denomination
of ten dollars, bearing interest at the
rate of 3.65 per ceut. per annum, .and
convertible at any time within one year
after their issue into the four per cent,
bonds authorized by the refunding act,
and to be issued only in exchange for
United States notes sent to the Treasury
by mail or otherwise. Such a provision
of law, supported by suitable regula
tions, would enable any person readily,
without cost or risk," lo convert his
money into an interest-bearing security
of the United States, and tbe money so
received could be applied to theredemp
tion of six per cent, bonds.
The coinage of gold during the last
fiscal year was $52,798,980. The coinage
of silver dollars, under the act passed
Februiry 28,1878, amounted on the 23d
of November, 1878, to $19,814,550, of
which amount $4,984,947 are in circula
tion, and the balance, $14,829,603, is still
in the possession of the Government.
With views unchanged with regard to
the act under which the coinage of sil
ver proceeds, it has been the purpose of
the Secretary faithfully to execute the
law, and to afford a fair trial to the
measure.
In the present financial condition of
the country, I am persuaded that the
welfare of legitimate business and in
dustry of every description will be best
promoted by abstaining from all at
tempts to make radical changes in the
existing financial legislation. Let it be
understood that during the coming year
the business of the country will be un
disturbed by governmental interference
with the laws affecting it, and we may
confident!y expect that the resumption
of specie payments, which will take
place at the appointed time, will be suc
cessfully and easily maintained, and
that it will be followed by a healthful
and enduring revival of business pros
perity.
Let the healing influence of time, the
inherent energies of our people, and the
boundless resources of our country,
have a fair opportunity, and a relief
from present difficulties will surely fol
low.
The report of the Secretary of War
shows that the army has been well and
economically supplied, that our small
force has been actively employed, and
has faithfully performed all the service
required of it. The morale of the army
has improved, and the number of deser
tions has materially decreased during the
year.
The Secretary recommends:
1. That a pension be granted to the
widow of the late Lieutenant Henry H.
Benner, Eighteenth Infantry, who lost
his life by yellow fever while in com
maud of the steamer "J. M. Chambers,"
sent with supplies for the relief of the
sufferers in the South from that disease.
2. The establishment of the aunuity
scheme for the benefit of the heirs of
deceased officers, as suggested by the
Paymaster General.
3. The adoption by Congress of a plan
for the publication of the records of the
War of the Rebellion, now being pre
pared for that purpose.
4 The increase of the extra per diem
of soldier-teachers employed in post
schools, and liberal appropriations for
the erection of buildings for schools and
libraries at the different posts.
5. The repeal or amendment of the
act of June IS, 1878, forbidding the "use
of the army as a posse comifaius, or oth
erwise, for the purpose of executing the
laws, except in such cases and under such
circumstances as may be expressly au
thorized by the Constitution or by act of
Congress."
G The passage of a joint resolution of
Congress legalizing the i-ssue of rations,
tents, and medicines which were made
for the relief of sufferers from yellow fe
ver.
7. That provisions be made for the
erection of a fire-proof building for the
preservation of certain valuable records,
now constantly exposed to destruction
by fire.
These recommendations are all com
mended to your favorable consideration.
The report of tbe Secretary of the
Navy shows that the navy has improved
during the last fiscal year. Work has
been done on seventy-five vessels, ten
of which have been thoroughly repair
ed, and made ready for sea. The others
are in rapid progress towards comple
tion. The total expenditures of the
year, including the amount appropriated
for the deficiencies of the provious year,
were $17,468,392 65. The actual expens
es chargeable to the year, exclusive of
these deficiencies, were 813,306.914 09 or
$767,199.18 less than those of the previ
ous year, and $4,928,677.74 less than the
expenses, including the deficiencies.—
The estimates for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1880, are $14,562,381.4-s—exceed
ing the aopropriations of the present
year only $33,949.75 ; which excess is oc
casioned by the demands of the Naval
Academy and the Marine Corps, as ex
plained in the Secretary's report. The
appropriations for the present fiscal
year are $14,528,431.70, which, in the
opinion of the .Secretary will be ampie
for all current expenses of the depart
ment during the year. The amount
drawn from the Treasury from July 1
to November 1, 1878, Is $1,740,544 14. of
which $70,980.75 has been refunded,
leaving as the expenditure for that pe
riod $4,669,564.39, or $520,899.24 less than
the corresponding period of the last fis
cal year.
The report of the Postmaster General
embraces a detailed statement of the
operations ofthe Postofflce Department.
The expenditures of that department
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878,
were $34,165,084.49. The receipts, in
cluding sales of stamps, money-order
business, and official stamps, we're $29,-
-277.516 95. The sum of $290,436,90, in
eluded in the foregoing statement of
expenditures, is chargeable to preceding
years, so that the actual expenditures
for tho fiscal year ended June 30 1878
are $33,874,647.50. The amount drawn
from the Treasury on appropriations, in
addition to the revenues of the depart
ment, was $5,307,652.82. The expendi
tures for the fiscal year ending June 30
18S0, are estimated at $36,571,900, and the
receipts from all sources at $30,664,023-
-90, leaving a deficiency to be appropriat
ed out of the Treasury of $5,907,876 10.
The report calls attention to the fact that
the compensation of postmasters and of
railroads for carrying the mail is regu
lated by law, and that the failure of
Congress to appropriate the amounts re
quired for these purposes does not re
lieve the Government of responsibility,
but necessarily incieases the deficiency
bilis which Congress will be called upon
to pass.
Tn providing for the postal service the
following questions are presented:—
Should Congress annually appropriate
a stun for its expenses largely in excess
of its revenues', or should such rates of
postage be established as will make the
department self sustaining? Should the
number of post-routes be diminished ?
Should other methods be adopted which
will increase the revenues or diminish
the expenses of the postal service?
The International Postal Congress,
which met at Paris May 1, 1878, and
continued in session until June 4, of the
same year, was composed of delegates
from nearly all the civilized countries
of the world. It adopted a new con
vention to take the place of the treaty
concluded at Berne October 9, 1874;
which goes into effect on the Ist of
April, 1879, between the countries whose
delegates have signed it. It was rati
fled and approved, by and with the
consent of the President, August 13,
1878. A synopsis of tbe Universal Pos-
■Spectator-
tal Convention will be found in the re
port of the Postmaster-General, and
the full text In the appendix thereto.—
In its orgigin the Postal Union com
prised twenty-three countries, having a
population <_\f three hundred and fifty
millions of rA>eple, On the Ist of April
next it will comprise forty-three coun
tries and colonies, with a population of
more tban six hundred and fifty mil
lions of people, and will soon, by the
accession of the few remaining countries
and colonies which maintain organized
postal services, constitute, in fact as well
as in name, aa its title indicates, a Uni
versal Union, regulating, upon a uni
form basis of cheap postage rates, the
postal intercourse between all civilized
nations.
Some embarrassment has arisen out
of the conflict between the custom laws
of this country and the provisions of the
Postal Convention, in regard to the
' transmission of foreign books and news
papers to this country by mail. It is
hoped that Congress will be able to de
vise some means of reconciling the dif
ficulties which have thus beea created,
so as to do justice to all parties involved.
The business ofthe Supreme Court,
and of tbe courts in many of the cir
cuits, has increased to such an extent
during the past year that additional leg
islation is imperative to relieve and pre
vent the delay of justice and possible
oppression to suitors which is thus occa
sioned. The encumbered condition of
these dockets is presented anew in the
report of the Attorney General, and the
remedy suggested is earnestly urged for
congressional action. The creation of
additional circuit judges, a. proposed,
would afford a complete remedy, and
would involve an expense—at the pres
ent rate of salaries—of-not more than
$60,000 a year.
The annual report of the Secretary of
the Interior and of the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs present an elaborate
account of the Dresent condition of the
Indian tribes, and of that branch of the
public service which ministers to their
interests. While the conduct of the
Indians generally has been orderly, and
their relations with their neighbors
friendly and peaceful, two local disturb
ances nave occurred, which were de
plorable in their character, but remain
ed, happily, confined to a comparatively :
small number of Indians. The discon
tent among the Bannocks, which led i
first to some acts of violence on the part i
of some members of the tribe and final- i
ly to the outbreak, appears to have been I
caused by an insufficiency of food on 1
the reservation, and this insufficiency 1
to have been owing to the inadequacy
of the appropriations, made by Con- I
gress, to the wants of the Indians, at a t
time when the Indiaas were prevented
from supplying the deficiency by hunt- )
ing. After an arduous pursuit" by the '
troops of the United States, and several i
engagements, the hostile Indians were <
reduced to subjection, and the larger I
part of them surrendered themselves as i
prisoners. I desire to call attention to <
the recommendation made by the Sec- i
retary of the Interior, that a sufficient I
fund be placed at the disposal of the t
Executive, to be used, with proper ac- I
countability, at discretion, in sudden I
emergencies of the Indian service.
The other case of disturbance waa that i
of a band of Northern Cheyeunes who I
suddenly left their reservation in the 1
Indian Territory and marched rapidly .•
through the States of Kansas and Ne- <
braska in the direction of their old I
hunting grounds, committing murders i
and other crimes on their way. From
documents accompanying the report of i
ihe Secretary of the Interior, it appears 1
that this disorderly baud was as fully .
supplied with the necessaries of life as i
the four thousand seven hundred other t
Indians, who remained quietly on the 1
reservation, and that the disturbance i
was caused by men of a restless and j
mischievous disposition among the In
dians themselves. Almost the whole of i
this band have surrendered to the mili- _
tary authorities, and it is a gratifying 1
fact that, when some of them had taken j
refuge in the camp ofthe Red Cloud 1
Sioux, with whom they had been in i
friendly relations the Sioux held them 1
us prisoners and readily gave them up (
to the officers of the United States, thus .
giving new proof of the loyal spirit i
which, alarming rumors to the contrary _
notwithstanding, they have uniformly ■
shown ever siuce the wishes they ex- -
pressed at the couucil of September, ■
1877, had been complied with. .
Both the Secretary of the Interior and |
the Secretary of War unite iv the rec .
omm.ndation that provision be made by <
Congress for the organization of a corps (
of mounted "Indian auxiliaries,'to be j
under the control of the army to be used _
for the purpose of keeping the Indians _
on the reservations and preventing or j
repressing disturbance on their part. I .
earnestly concur in this reeommenda- .
tiou. It is believed tbat that tho organ- i
ization of such a body of Indian caval- (
ry, receiving a moderate pay from the i
Government, would considerably weak- (
en the restless element among the Indi- t
ans by withdrawing from it a number of i
young men and giving them congenial (
employment under the Goverment, it 1
beicg a matter of experience that Indi
ans in our service almost without excep- (
tion are faithful in the performance of 1
the duties assigned to them. Such an f
organization would materially aid the ,
army in the accomplishment of a task <
for which its numerical strength is <
sometimes found insufficient. ,
But, while the employment of force
for the prevention or repression of In
dian troubles is of occasional necessity,
aud wise preparation should be made to
that end, greater reliance must be placed
on humane and civilizing agencies for
the ultimate solution of what is called
the Indian problem. It may be very
difflcultand requiremuch patient effort,
to curb the unruly spirit of the savage
Indian to the restraints of civilized life,
but experience shows that it is not im
possible. Many of the tribe which are
now quiet and orderly and self-support
ing were once ns savage as any that at
present roam over the plains or in the
mountains of the far West, and were
then considered inaccessible to civiliz
ing influences. It may be impossible to
raise them fully up to the level of the
white population of the United States ;
but we should not forget that they are
the aborigines of the country, and called
the soil tiieir own on which our people
have grown rich, powerful, and happy.
We owe it to them as a moral duty to
help them in attaining at least that de
gree of civilization which they may be
able to reach. It is not only our duty
it is also onr interest to do so. Indians
who have become agriculturists or herds
men, and feel an interest in property
will thenceforth cease to be a warlike
and disturbing element. It is also a
well authenticated fact that Indiana are
apt to be peaceable and quiet when their
children are at school, and I am grati
fied to know, from the expressions of
Indians .heo-eelvesand from many con
curring reports, that, there is a steadily
jticroasing desire, even among Indians
be'ot'ging to comparatively wild tribes,
to have their children educated. I iuvit.
attention to the reports of the Secretary
of Indians Affairs, touching the experi
ment recently inaugurated, in taking fif
ty Indian children, boys and girls, from
different tribes,to the Hampton Nor
mal Agricultural Institute, in Virginia,
wnere they are to receive an elementary
English education and traini.g in agri
culture and other useful work, to be re
turned to their tribes, after the comple-
course, as interpreters, instructors,
ami examples. It is reported that the
office, charged with the selection of
those children might have had thous
ands of young Indians sent with him
iiacl it been possible to make provisions
!? r ?*____ r agree with the Secretary of
tne Interior in saying that "the result
NO. 12.
h of* this interesting experiment, if favor
a able, may be destined to become an important
-portant factor in the advancement o
- civilization among the Indians."
a The question, whether a change it
f the control of fhe Indian service shoulc
1 be made, was, at the last session of Con
- gresa, referred to a committee fer inqui
fry and report. Without desiring to an<
- tieipate that report, I venture to express
8 the hope that the decision of so impor
a tant a question, the views expressed
1 above may not be lost sight of, and that
1 the decision, whatever it may be, will
- arrest further agitation of this subject,
- such agitation being apt to produce a
s disturbing effect upon the service as well
I as on the Indians themselves.
In the enrollment of the bill making
t appropriations for sundry civil expenses,
i at the last session of Congress, that par
s' tion which provided for the centinua-
I tion of the Hot Springs Commission
• was omitted. As the commission had
i completed the work of taking testimony
- on the many conflicting claims, the sus
pension of their labors, before determin
, ing the rights of claimants, threatened,
for a time to embarrass the interests,
, not only of the Government, but also of
a large number of the citizens of Hot
; Springs, who were waiting for final ac
tion on their claims before beginning
contemplated improvements. In order
to prevent serious difficulties, which
were apprehended, and at the solid ta
tion.of many leading citizens of Hot
Springs, and others interested in the
welfare of the town, the Secretary of the
Interior was authorized to request the
late commissioners to take charge of the
records of the proceedings, and to per
form such as could properly be done by
them under such circumstances, to fa
cilitate the future adjudication of the
claims until their rights should be final
ly determined. Thelare commissioners
complied with that request, and report
that the testimony, in all the cases, has
been written out, examined, briefed,
and so arranged as to facilitate an early
settlement when authorized by law.—
It is recommended th&t the requisite
authority be given at as early a day in
the session as possible, and tbat a fair
compensation be allowed the late com
missioners for the expense incurred and
the labor performed by them since the
25th of June last.
I invite the attention of Congress to
the recommendations made by the Sec
retary of the Interior with regard to the
f (reservation ofthe timber on the public
ands of the United States. The pro
tection of the public property is one of
thefirst duties of the Government. The
Department ofthe Interior should there
fore, be enabled by sufficient appropria
tions, to enforce the laws in that respect.
But this matter appears still more im
portant as a question of public economy
The rapid destruction of our forests is
an evil fraught with the gravest conse
quences, especially in the mountain dis
tricts, where the rocky slopes, once de
nuded of their trees will remain so for
ever. There the injury, once done, can
not be repaired. I fully concur with
the Secretary of the Interior in the
opinion that, for this reason, legislation
touching the public timber in the moun
tainous States and Territories of the
West, should be especially well consid
ered, and that existing laws, ln which
the destruction of the forests is not suf
ficiently guarded against, should be
speedily modified. A general law con
cerning this important subject, appears
to me to be a matter of urgent public
necessity.
From the organization of the Govern
ment, the importance of encouraging,
by all possible means, the increase of
our agricultural productions has been
acknowledged and urged upon the at
tention of Congress and the people as
the surest and readiest means of increas
ing our substantial and enduring pros
perity.
The words of Washington are as ap
plicable to-day as when, in the eighth
annual message, he said :—"lt is not to
be doubted that with reference either to
individual or national welfare, agricul
ture is of primary importance. In pro
portion as nations advance in popula
tion and other circumstances of maturi
ty, this truth becomes more apparent,
and renders the cultivation of the soil
more and more an object of public pat
ronage. Institutions for promoting it
grow up, supported by the public purse
—and to what object can it be dedicated
with greater propriety? Among the
means which have been employed to
this end, none have been attended with
greater success than the establishment
of boards composed of proper characters,
charged with collecting and diffusing
information, and enabled, by premiums '
and small pecuniary aids, to encourage
and assist tho spirit of discovery and
improvement, this species of establish
ment contributing doubly to the iucrease
of improvement by stimulating to enter
prise and experiment, and by drawing
to a common centre the results every
whore of individual skill and observa
tion, aud spreading them thence over
the whole nation. Experience accord
ingly hath shown that they are very
cheap instruments of immense national
benefit."
The great preponderance of the agri
cultural, over any other interest in the
United States, entitles it to all the con
sideration claimed for it by Washing
ton. About one-half of tbe population
ofthe United States is engaged in agri
culture. The value of the agricultural
products of the United States, for the
year 1878, is estimated at three
thousand millions of dollars. The ex
ports of agricultural products for the
year 1877, as appears from the report of
the Bureau of .Statistics, we;e five hun
dred and twenty-four millions of dollars.
The great extent of our country, with
diversity of soil and climate, enables us
to produce within our borders, and by
our own labor, not only the necessaries
but most of the luxuries that are con
sumed in civilized countries. Yet. not
withstanding our advantages of soil,
climate, and intercommunication, it ap
pears from the statistical statements in
the report of the Commissioner of Ag
riculture, that we import annually from
foregn lands many millions of dollars'
worth of agricultural products which
could be raised in our country.
Numerous questions arise in the prac
tice of advanced agriculture which can
only be answered by experiment*, often
costly and sometimes fruitless, which
are beyond the means of private mdi
viduals, and area just and proper charge
on the wholelnation for the benefit of
tbe nation. It is good policy, especially
in times of depression and uncertainty
in other business pursuits, with a vast
area of uncultivated, and hence unpro
ductive territory, wisely opened to
homestead settlement, to encourage, by
every proper and legitimate means, the
occupation and tillage of the soil. The
efforts of the Departmentof Agriculture
to stimulate old and introduce new agri
cultural industries, to Improve the
quality and increase the quantity of our
products, to"determine the value of old
or establish the importance of new
methods of culture, are worthy of your
careful and favorable consideration, and
assistance by such appropriations of
money and enlargement of facilities as
may seem to be demanded by the pres
ent favorable conditions for the growth
and rapid development of this important
interest.
The abuse of animals in transit is
widely attracting public attention. A
national convention of societies special
ly interested in the subject has recently
met at Baltimore, and the facts devel
oped, both in regard to cruelties to ani
mals and the effect of such cruelties
upon the public health, would seem to
demand the careful consideration of
Congress and the enactment of more ef
ficient laws for the prevention of these

The attention of Congress is again
invited to the condition of the river
front of the city of Washington. It is a
matter of vital importance to the health
of tbe residents ofthe National Capital,
both temporary and permanent, that the
low lands in front of the city, now sub
ject to tidal overflow, should be reclaim
ed. In their present condition these
flats obstruct the drainage of the city
and are a dangerous source of malarial
poison. The raclemation will improve
the navigation of the river by restricting
and consequently deepening its chan
nel, and, is also of importance when
considered in connection with the ex
tension ot'the public ground and the en
largement ofthe park west and south of
the Washington Monument. The re
port of the board of survey, hertofore or
dered by act of Congress, on the im
provement of the harbor of Washington
and Georgetown, is respectfully com
mended to consideration.

The benevolent, reformatory, and
penal institutions of the District are ail
entitled to the favorable attention of
Congres-. The Ueform School needs
additional buildings and teachers. Ap
propriations which will place all of these
institutions in a condition to become
models of usefulness and beneficence,
will be regarded by the country as
liberality wisely bestowed.
The commissioners, with evident jus
tice, request attention to the discrimina
tion made by Congress aeainst the Dis
trict in the donation of'land for the sup
port ofthe public schools, and ask that
the same liberality that has been shown
to the inhabitants ofthe various States
and Territories of the United States, may
be extended to the District of Columbia.
The commissioners also invite atten
tion to the damage inflicted upon public
and private interests by the present loca
tion ofthe depots and switching-tracks
of tbe several railroads entering the city,
and ask for legislation looking to their
removal. The recommendations and
suggestions contained in the report will,
I trust, receive the careful consideration
of Congress.
Sufficient time has, perhaps, uotelaps
ed since the re-organization of the gov
ernment of the District, under the recent
legislation of Congs-ess, for the expres
sion ofa confident opinion as to its suc
cessful operalion ; but the practical re
sults already attained are so satisfactory
that the friends of the new government
may well urge upon Congress the wis
dom of itscoutinu-nce without essential
modification, until, by actual experi
ence, its advantages and defects may be
more fully ascertained.

The Power that Sound Money
gives the Workingmen.—The editor
of the Fincastle Herald gives the follow
ing clear and true statement of how
much more money is able to do now for
the working classes than a few years
ago, when it was scattered heedlessly
through the country :
"In these times of financial depres
sion, when money Is hard togetholdof,
it is a matter for consoling thought to
know that the purchasing power ofthe
circulating medium has enhanced in
about the same ratio ns it has been re
duced in quantity. To illustrate: In
1864 the cheapest laborer received $1.50
a day; at tbe present times he receives
about $1. Bnt in 130.4 the purchasing
power ofthe dollar was not half what it
is to day. For instance, to take the
commonest articles, sugar, which can be
bought for 10 cents a pound to-day, cost
20 cents In.ISG-!: coffee in 1864 cost 46
cents a pound, and now it can be had
for 20 cents; p.-.rk by the barrel cost
845, h hile in 137S ii can bo bought for
$9; prints and ginghams that are worth
now only 6 cents a yard cost then 40
cents, and so on through the whole list
of articles of ordinary and general con
sumption. It is quite evident that
wa«.;es, low ns they arc now, will buy
Btneh more than they did in the "fiush
times" alter the w:<r. and that a dollar
to-day is worth &■ least twice as much
as a dollar twelve years ago.
"In view of these facts, the farmer
should not be discouraged at the com
paratively low price of the products of
his farm. At the present rates, he will
receive, in some ca.es, in substantial
value, more for his produce than when
he receive;! double lite present prices.
"These views are as applicable to the
day laborer and mechanic as to the farm
er, and if they were fuliy appreciated
the cry of 'nard times' would be less
vigorously and continuously sung than
it now is."

A Nevada paper tells of a young lady
in that region that is so delicate and
ethenal a creature that on losing a hair
pin from her head the other day, she
caught a bad cold that luiuc on* for a

Reversible ulsters are to be worn by
the young men this winter, but it is a
mistaken idea that they are designed
especially for these who have encoun
tered financial reveries.
