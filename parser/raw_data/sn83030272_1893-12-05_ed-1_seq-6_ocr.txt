B tercet drojdd out ot eight In tho message

BBHB l top; importance before the President and tho
BflBflt li public pressing tor attontlon and demand-
BB h Ins tho frankest and fullest treatment, tho
BK message la multitudinous with dotalls
BB eonoornlnfir a vast variety of subordinate
B 1 subjeoU; and It Is conventional, almost to
BB : tho dTOO of platltudo In Its statements
BBB' ' opinion and recommendations. Mr.
BBB Cleveland devotes moro space to
B what ha regards as an excessive pur-
B chase ot seods by tho Department
B I of ARrlculture, than to tho momentous
BB E nterprlsoot throne-bulldlnn; which ho has
BB b undertaken In Hawaii. Ho dovotes almost
BBB t' 8 manywords to tho condition of tho North
B V American Indian tribes as to tho tariff,
B 7 which occupied all of his thoughts In 1337,
B I and which has bocomo In 1833 an affair not
BBB I merely ot promises, but of performance.
BBB,. Forthcso reasons tho racsaaKO submitted
BBB yesterday may fairly be criticised as un-
B satisfactory In Its rnngo. If not actually
BBB evaslvo in Its Intontion.
BBB Concornlntf Hawaii, Congress Rets no snt-
BBB lsfuctlon. It cots only the nssuranco, ex-
BBB traordlnary at any time and under tho
BBBBJ present clrcumntancos amounting almost
BBBB to lusult, that as soon as tho Presldont has
H accomplished tho restoration of monarchy
BBB' In the Islands by tho overthrow of aQov-
HH' ernment with whloh our own Govern-
H munt Is In friendly diplomatic rcla-
BBB- tlons, Mr. Cleveland will communicate to
BBBB the law-maklnfr and war-making author-
H ity what It was that ho instructed Mlnlstor
B "Willis to do. Tho assumption ot tho
BBB ; power to dictate to Hawaii Its destiny, on
BBB his Individual responsibility and without
BBB consulting Congress, Is complete. "From
BBB the facts dovolopod," says this oiccu-
B tivo offloer. "it ecemed to m that the only
H '1 honorablt course for our Government to pur-
B sue was to undo tho wrong that had
B been dono by thoso ropresontlng us, and to
H restore as far as practlcablo the status ex-
BBB lstlngat the tlmeot our forclblo Intorvcn-
BBB tlon. With a view to accomplishing this
BBB result within the constitutional limits ot
BBB executlvo- power, our present Mlnlstor at
BBB Honolulu has received appropriate instruo-
H tlons to that end." Congress Is not likely to
H forget that it was actually in session at
H the time when tho President undertook to
BBBB constitute himself tho Government for tho
BB purposo ot undoing a wrong which his In-
B dividual Judgment had alone discerned.
B Furthermore, Congress will reserve to It-
B " tho right to determine whether the
H' policy ot infamy, now openly avowed by
B' tho Frealdent, has respected" the constltu
H' if tlonal limits ot executft power," or has
B' boldly overleaped them.
B In what ha has to say about the reform ot
B. the tariff. Mr. OLKTErjAiro recognizes "tho
B ' ejmphatlo verdict ot the people," but he Is
Br very careful not to say what that emphatic
Bl '-! verdict was. There Is not a word about the
B constitutional limitations on the taxing
B- power of the Government, as affirmed by
BBBt Democratlo platform on which ho
BBB-. wu tltotod. Tho generalities and half-
BBB: truths and solemn nothings which aro so
BB characteristic of his rhetorical style, aro
BB employed to hido the naked iniquity ot bis
B proposition that tho platform shall be re-
H pndiated by tha party, and that the Domoc-
V racy shall now engage In the construction
B' ot n BTOwedly protective tariff, differing
B f trom the MoJCctlet tariff in tho drgreo
B of its MoElnleyism, but not in kind.
BB; The President's approval ot the Wilson
BBI- protectionist bill is distinctly expressed.
BBl e professes to regard the new rob-
B." ber tariff of 1693 as tho result ot "much
BBfl. unselfish and patriotic work," and records
BH his belief that it "doalswlth 1U subject
H consistently and as thoroughly aa existing
B, conditions permit." Tho tariff for revenuo
BBB. 1 only which Mr, Clevklanu now favors Is
BB' "a tax upon incomes derived from certain
B' corporato investments;" the extent of tax
BBB; and tho character of tho corporate luvest-
BB'" ments to be taxed, at o not specified.

As to it Corporation Tax,
The spirit of communism Is no sooner
laid in ono corner of Mr. Wilson's com
mittee room Minn It breaks out In another
corner. The Democrats with Populist prin
ciples havo no soonor loarned from Mr.
UouriKE Cock n an that a tax upon tho In
comes of Individuals would knock tho Dem
ocratic party lu thoso parts Into tho middle
ot two weoks aflor noxt, than they aro said
to be showing a burning fondness for a tax
upon the net earnings of corporations.
A corporation, to the lngonuous Populist
mind and In tho haranguos ot ranters and
soapless sapheads ot many names, Is tho
personification and mlxturo of all wicked
ness. It Is a ploaslng combination of
CALiatTLA and Dam Damoeii. It grinds
the poor, defrauds tho publio, robs tho
orphan, and cheats tho widow. Its stock
holders rldo in coaohes ot solid gold, eat off
diamond plato, and dlssolvo pearls In their
salad dressing. Tako tho knowledge of tho
facts and tho dlspasslonato temper dis
played by tho Chlnoso artists, who carica
ture tho foreign dovlls, nud you got a faint
notion of the montal stato of tho spout era
against corporations. What happlnoss to
havo theso monsters taxed I
Yet wo Invito tho nttontlon of tho Popu
list mombors of Mr. Wilson's conimlttco
to tho fact that a corporation Is only a con
vonlonoy ot business, no moro criminal
than a partnership. Vast business Inter
ests, many of thorn liullspousablo to tho
public, aro carried on In this way; and tho
majority of tho stockholders though this
is really no business ot Mr. Wilson's com
mlttco or ot tho public aro holders ot only
small amounts of stock, aro poor men aud
womon. Wo mention this bocauso tho In
teresting theory that tho rich should bo
taxod for tho benefit ot tho poor seems to
obtain In Mr. Wilson'b committee. Not
monstors, nor millionaires, but plain, ordi
nary, struggling folk would most fool a tax
on tho not earnings of corporations.
Tho first to feel such n tax, howover,
would hardly bo tho stockholders. Tho em
ployes would feci It first. Tho public would
fcol it In higher prices or lower quality of
production or service. A railroad corpora
tion, for Instance, would put up faros and
freights, or reduce expenses by inking off
trains nnd dismissing Us men or cutting
down their wages. In any case, tho publio
would havo to pay tho bill.
Tho main reasons against a Fednrnl tax
on the net earnings of corporations nro
that such a tax would be unconstitutional,
that It would bo communlstlcal, aud that it
would bo unspeakably silly.
Tho New French Ministry.
After a prolongod delay, for which Presi
dent Cahnot seems to bo held mainly
responsible, M. CAHiMlit-Pcrtiint, tho pro
siding officer ot the Chamber of Deputies,
has consented to form a Cabinet. . His
reluctance to undertuko tho task was
attestod by rcpeatod refusals, and was
Justified bythoblttor experlouco of many
leading politicians. Including Oamiietta
himself, who by accepting tho post of Pre
mlor darkened a fair prospoct ot obtaining
tho Presidency ot tho Kepubllo. Tho only
Minister who can bo said to havo strength
ened his hold upon a large soctlon of tho
French pcoplo by his conduct and success
lu ofllco wasM. Constanb; and tho recent
crisis would have terminated earlier had
not M. Cabnot rciusod to permit him
to occupy again a Cabinet position.
That no Cablnot can long maintain Itself,
howover, without the support of the friends
ot M. Constats seems recognized by tho
Inclusion ot two ot his most stanch
adhoronts, M. SrcLLrn aud M. Buhdeau,
in the new Ministry.
Considered as a whole, tho Cabinet headed
by M. CASiMin-PiiniEn 1b rcpreseiitutlvo of
tho Opportunist and Modorato opinions
which are supposed to hnvo been sanctioned
at tho last gonural election. It Is moro
representative of tho ostensible- majority
of the Chamber than was Its ptodocesdor;
for thrco members ot the latter held views
irreconcilable with those of their chief, aud
consequently M. Duruv hud Intended to
dispense with tholr services after obtaining
a vote of coulldenco. As it is acknowledged
on all hands thattbo progrummo submlttod
to tho Chambor by M. Dui'cr would have
commaudud u largo majority had It been
pressed to a voto, it Is scarcely to bo
expected that tho proposals of his suc
cessor "111 differ in any essential fea
tures. That M. Cahimik-I'eiiii:!! and his
colleagues will pursue n rolutlvcly conserv
ative uud nntl-.Sodallst policy may bo In
ferred from their own political antecedents
as woll us from thn composition of tho
Chamber. Tho fact that tho now Cabinet
Is hailed Ironically by M. Clemknceau as a
triumph for the Popo, Indicates a general
belief that it will to fur recognize tha
friendship evinced by Leo XIII. for tho
I'ronch republic, as to deservo tho support
of tho so-called " rallied" ltopubllcaus. Tho
other facts that M. IUvnal is a Jow, and
that M. Udbdeau has been denounced by
tha anti-Semites as an agent of the Koths
citiLPs, may be regurdod ns evldeuce that
the Government will havo tho good will of
influential financiers.
Are wo to conclude that tho protruded
crUls has dono 110 harm to thn cause of
stable and judicious government? On the
contrary. It is to bo feared that the chuotlo
condition Into which the Chamber ot Depu
ties was thrown at tho outset of itsllrot
sessluu, has seriously irupuirod the means
of constructing a firm and homogeneous
majority. It must ba remembered that the
present Chamber contains an exceptionally
large number of new men, utmost destitute
of political experience. They were elected
undor a moro or loss explicit mandate lioin
their constituents to conform to the moder
ate policy persoultled lu M, Dnptrr. Un
doubtedly they would have fulfilled their
express or tacit understanding with tho
electors had an opportunity been glvon
them ot taking part la a vote of confi
dence. Ilut before they could commit them
selves to a deflnito set of opinions and enroll
themselves In an organized, comprehensive
party, they wore exposed to tho disinte
grating strain of the most protracted crisis
which has occurred undor tho Third Repub
lic, with the exception ot that which forced
President Ghevt to resign. The result has
been the formation of groups, not only out-1
I
side but Insldo the ranks of the Moderates.
The substitution of numorous small groups
for two largo opposing parties has hitherto
been fatal to tho durability ot Ministries lu
France, and the prospect of a better order
of things, whloh ecomod to bo opened by
tho last election, is now ovorcast.
Trying to Hcpross Manifest Destiny.
It Is unfortunate for tho Democratic party
that tho Domocratlo Kxccutlvo, bcsldos his
excursions In soarch of a monarchy In Ha
waii, should oppose that expansion ot
Amorlcan commmco and of tho Amorlcoh
spirit which would follow tho annexation of
the Sandwich Islands. It Is unfortunate for
tho Domocratlo party that the Domocratlo
representatives on tho Comralttoo of Ways
end Moans havo framed a tariff bill which,
by an odious Bocrlllco of tho agricultural
Intorests of all the northorn part of tho
United States, proposes 10 lurnisu mo
Dominion with such free access to our
markots that tho commercial or political
union of this country nnd Canada must bo
retarded nnd postponed.
Mr. Wilson, In his apology for the wonk
and fraudulont bill that boars his namo,
had much toeay about building up n for
eign trado. Plonty of other Domocratlo
publio men whoso hands havo been itching
to reform tho tariff In tho lost llfteon yearB,
havo put this expansion ot our foreign
trado as oue of tho gro.it goals of cco
nomlo change. Aud now a Domocratlo
Prosldont seeks to chock nnd repress tho
expansion and prevont tho suptemncy ot
Amorlcan interests, commercial, political,
and patrlotlo in tho Pacific; and a bill pur
porting to bo a Domocratlo tariff bill throws
obstacles In tho way ot tho greatest expan
sion of American trado nnd ot American
ideas that can now bo soborly Imagined, tho
union of tho United States and Cannila.
Tho Democrutlo party, ns n political en
tity, may havo to onduro tho odium of thoso
surrenders of American principles aud theso
betrayals of its own policies; but tho Dem
ocratic party, whntovor may bo tho vngn
rlcs of Its temporary leaders, Is truo to Its
Ideas, nnd thoso Ideas aro American.
Mello nnd Monarchy.
Thoro Is something suggestlvo In tho
vigor with which Admiral Mello and all
his friends deny that ho Is trying to restore
thoomplro in Brazil, ltuv lUnnosA. who
ought to bo good authority, says that tho
lnsurgont causo Is truo to the republic
truer to It than Peixoto'b Government is.
Mello, who Is even bottor authority, now
protests that ho has novor contemplated
an act so repugnant as bringing back mon
archy to Dtuzil. It is n weak invention of
tho onomy, dcclaro tho Insurgents, de
signed to Injure them thero and clsewhore.
Hardly less significant Is tho persistency
with whloh Tresldont Peixoto's supporters
renew theso charges. At ono tlmo tho
rumor was spread that Prlnco Pieiiiie, old
Dom Pedko's grandson, was actually
aboard tho Aqutdubnn, so that he might
lose no tlmo In being crowned, after
Peixoto should bo overthrown. Dlroctly
on tho heels of Mello'h Indignant protest
at being callod a monarchist. It Is declared
that his doparturo from tho harbor ot Itlo
Is lth a view to stir up and Increase an ex
isting sentiment In favor of the empire. In
Dahla nnd Pcrnnmbuco.
So, whothor Mello Is or Is not a mon
archist, ho and his opponents scorn to ngrco
that it would lnjuro his causo to huvo him
thought one. In other words, tho pcoplo of
Ilrazll, having once got rid of tholr throne,
do not propose to havo It brought back.
If eo, Ilrazll Is not wholly unhappy, even
In tho midst of her misfortunes. She might
bo worse off. Sho is not llko poor Hawaii,
which, having overthrown monarchy, may
now have It set up again by foreign force,
supplied from our free republic.
Itupld Transit.
Elovnted rullroad travel is worse than
evor in lti iuconvonlonce, discomfort, nud
danger. Tho capacity of tho roads remains
unchanged, but tho tralllc continues to lu
croaso. That Is, It Increases In thoso hours
when thero Is room for incroaso; but In tho
hours when tho movement of humanity Is
at its maximum tho roads do not admit of
auy Increase. On the contrary, there Is a
large aud constantly growing overflow to
tho surface lines.
In tha moan tlmo thn Rapid Transit Com
mission has accomplished nothing, and has
given conclusive oitdence that It is lucupa
blo of affording any relief whntovor. It deals
with Impractlcublo schemes; It Is Irrogoluto
and vacillating, aud In Its methods thero In
neither logio nor consistency. At ono mo
ment It declared Its belief that tho elevated
structures aro dlstlgiiiiug to tho city anil
that thero must bo no addition to them, nud
at another It plain wholly now and for
midable elevated linos completely gridiron
lng tho town fiom ono uud to tho other. It
Is In favor of tunnels, of viaduct, und of
roads ou lofty stilts, but It entertains no
idea or project of practical value. It should
bo abolished us soon as possible,
Slnco its first sitting tho Coin mission has
loft uothlug uudouu to defeat every meri
torious scheme for affording relief to tho
publio that has been presented. It has con
cerned Itself with visionary engineering
and with enterprises tliut capital would not
touch; and It adheres steadily to that policy
to-day. Had the Commission been govorned
by common souso, our elevated system
would already afford a vastly greator ac
commodation to tho publla needs than It
does. Tho Commission has preferred to
set its face against the elevated system,
and to moke, as It were, a personal issue- of
tho case.
Thero must be an appeal by the people
from tho decisions of tho Commission.
Were Its deliberations founded lu honesty
and In a proper sense of its duty wo should
have twice as mauy trains running ou tho
Manhattan lines, running at higher aud
satisfactory rates of speed, with cars
lighted by electricity, and with steam
banished from our streets. Thoro is no
roasoa whatever why oleetrielty should not
bo substituted for 6team on our elevated
roads where the disadvantages of the ordi
nary trolley system do not exist; and that
is the sort ot rapid trunslt which wo are en
titled to and must presently have. What
woueedls a Commission with brains aud
public spirit.
It would ba exceedingly bad diplomacy
for the Chinese Minister at Washington to at

Our Chinese residents have less than five

Even If Minister Vino Yu shall succeed In

The Chinese among us have been In tronble,

The people know that tariff reform Is a good
thin Vitn O0ntr.
They also know that It Is a good thing for a
great political party to stand by Its plodgos
and to keep Its promises. When a party has
parried an election on the square declaration
thatproteotlon Is unconstitutional, and that It
Is fraud and robbery, that party cannot safoly
turn around and mako a protectionist tariff.

Tho Constitution of tho United States of
Ilrazll provides that tho Trosldont shall bo
elected by a direct voto of the pooplo. and that
the cnndldato who gets a majority ot tho votos
cast shall be declared elocted. Ho must be n
nattvo Urazlllun: he holds ofllco for four
rears: ho Is not eligible for tho succeodlnc
term. Trosldcnt Peixoto. who Is a candidate
for reelection, says he Is not Ineligible for nn

not Prosldont, nnd merely reachod the Presi

argument It Is an ovaslon ot tho Ineligibility
clausoot the Constitution. The object of thut
cliu.se was to provent a President from using
the Influonaoot Ills office la favor of his re

thus using his Influence tho same as It he had

It wnsagrent victory for the cause of

Colorado. We lonra from the official roturna
of the elections there that tho majority la favor
of the cause was 0.317. Tho womon ot tha
Centennial Etate can hereafter vote In all Stato

fragists of any part of tho country boast of
such a victory. Tho Colorado miners wore
dlshoartonedfora while by the repeal ot the
Siikiiman' HUter Purchase law: but. all tho
samo, they carrlod their hearts to the polls
when they votod to cUo tho ballot to women.
That was right. Kvery voter should use both
his brains and his heart, at also both his eyes.
In politics.
Colorado Is the second Stato In the Union to
grant tho full suffrage to women In btate eluc

four years ago. and there havo bean no com

It Is for a patrlotlo purposo that tho

It must be judged by Its merits. We do not
desire to see It boosted to the front It it cannot
maintain Itself there, and justify Its claim to
stand there, and approve Its ability to meet
any foreign rltalrr upon eoual terms.
We have now good schools ot music We
have a large number ot American singers and
musicians. We have some excellent sympho
nltta. We have two or three admirable or
chestras. Wa have plenty of singing and mu
sical societies. Wo can speak well of those
People's Concerts and People's Ringing Classes
which have been organized by that unquatllng
enthusiast, Jlr. Fiunk lUuuosiU.
It would ba hard to keep down any great
American singer, male or female, operatic or
eoncert, or any first-class performer upon
any Instrument whatever. Such people do
not need to fight long for recognition. They
are not easily discouraged. There is an Im
partial and intelligent musical community to
which they can always appeal in person, with
assurance.

It Is Just as much a protective tariff bill as
tha existing law Is. We donot refer. In making
this statement, to the artlctos that are put
upon the ftoo list We refer to the duties that
are Imposed upon Imports. Those duties aro
all left at a point which makes them protective
of American manufactures against foreign Im
portations, The duties Imposed by tho Me
Klnley bill are undoubtedly towered, and In
many Instances uroatly lowored, butMcKln
toy's duties wero placed at a figure far above
what was necessary to Insure protection. All
that the Wilson bill has done Is to top off the
unnecessary protection, but It has left alt that
Is necessary to secure effectual protection.
Our readnia may accept Has a fact that all
duties nn forolgn imports tint come Into com
petition wttli American manufactures aro left
at a protective point This la certainly one of
the most astonishing outcomes ot a long nnd
blttor contest that tho world wns evor treated
to. Tho fable ot the mountain and mouso
bears hnrdly nny comparison to It
Hut whllo Now Pnelamt and tho Atlantlo
scacoRit hnvo hnd their war In framing our
freo-trado prntecth o-tnrlfl hill, what has hap
pened to us ot tho Houth I Tho Southern
Htntes put tho Domocrntlo rarty Into pnwor.
whon It ,ould havo remained out of povr to
doomsday If It had lookod for fa ors to Now
England. What lino that jmrtydone for tho
Houth In return? Mmplythls: It has done all
thnt lay In Its power to Injure nnd cripple a
grent part of.the Houth by tha bill that Its
rapresnutatlvcH haa framed. Tho houth
wanted free Imports, that alio mlwht buy all
hor supplies ns choanly ns posalblo and thnt
justice might b dune all nround. To get
those frco Imports she was willing to give up
tho advantnees tt.nttho principle of rroteo
tlon secured to her. Ilut here comes the
Domocratlo Committee on Ways nud Means,
retaining tho duties on Imports for tha bonont
of tho New Knglandcr, but putting coal. Iron
oro. and sugar ou tha froo list, to thn Incal
culable Injury of Virginia. Wobt Virginia.
North Carolina, Alabama, Uoorgla. and Louis
iana. Wo should like to know whero the
Domocratlo paity of tho country would ba
without these Htutos? It owos Its possession
of powor to them, nnd this Is a pretty roturn to
mako thum for tho gift Wo aro tor free and
uurestilctod trnde. Hut as burdens must bo
Imposed upon Imports to raise tho revenues
that tho Government noods, wo yield to a
scheme otilutlas. but wo Insist that those du
ties shall bo so distributed thnt all shall boar
an equal and ratnblo share. Wo rotuso to sub
mit to having thorn so adjusted thnt Now Eng
land manufacturers can mako us pay for their
goods what they please, while our own prod
ucts era forced Into full competition with the
products of tho rest of the world. Equality Is
equity: but this Is the most uuoqual schomo
that can bo do Ised.
We urgo tha representatives from all tho
fitates wo havo namod to voto against tho Wil
son bill In toto. unless coal. Iron ore, nnd su
gar aro given tho benefit ot tho samo protec

TnE Sex h&i corao forward with a substitute
for tho Wilson Tariff bill which possessos at
leasttho moritof simplicity. Wo glvo tho pro
posed bill In full, tttlo and all.
It must be confessed that this substitute has
soma morlt There is no faorIUsm In It. and
no protection. It Is in full uccord with tho
Domocratlo platform, which denies that Con
cress has tha constitutional right to levy duties
for any other purpose than to ralso revenue for
the Government economically administered.
Under such a tariff law thero could be no dis
graceful scramble for special favor, and no
log-rolling on tho part of members of Congress.
If ft duty of U3 nor cent ad valorom should
turn out to ba too high. It would be eusy
enough to reduce the ruto to 30. or23. orl'O
per cent, just In proportion to tho financial
necessities ot tho Oovernmont
Wo do not expect to see Congress adopt thla
simple plan. Tlie Idea of protection has too

The ordinary Grand Jury, tor the December

Lock wooi! foreman. Juitgs Cowing told tho
Grand Jury that persons would come before
them doslroua ot 1 robeeutlng ethers, and
maintaining that they were influenced only by
tha desiro to prnmotothe publio good, whereas
they were not unfrHiiuently actuated by per
sonal animosity and spleeu. it was tho duty
of tha Grand Jury to Investigate the stories
told by thxxo perwons. and to look Into their
motives, if any. The Grand Jury must not act
hastily In any ease. Tha finding ot an Indict

which even a subaequnnt acquittal, perhaps,

make, and In general the contract prices of lfii
our vessels, In consequence ot tlie premiums, JH
donotrepresont what they actually cost Hut VH
there are two full offsets to the ptemlumla H
auch cases. The first Is a gain In speed over Bm
what was required, whloh represents a cor- Kff
responding gain In efflelenoy that fully repays sCrv
tha extra cost The othor Is that low bids Are tH.V
made for the construction of vessels, Wed B'
on tho expectation ot earning premiums. An ,1
Illustration ot such low bids Is mentioned b II
the Secretary tn tho case of the last three) H

the many hundreds ot thousands of dollars

longer than It was for her slater ship, the .
Detroit so that It will stretch from near Plum
Island to Btrattord BhoaL The Detroit as lis I
well known, has been acoeptod and Is In service
at Rio da Janeiro. When tha three 2,000-ton-
ners were authorized, more than five roars ago, .
they were designed for a guaranteed spaod of ' '
18 knots an hour. The cost was limited br
the not of Congross to $700,000 each, for ma- i
chlnory and hull. Two bids woro made on I
them, but both excoedod the limit Ths Navy I
Department in that dilemma, reduced tha I
spood requirement to 17 knots, grantod an ad- tfl
jtltlonnt period of six months In tho tlmo nl- ,
lowed for imlldlng, and rearranged the promt- W.i1
urns sons tu tie moro favorablo to the contrae- Htk
torn. On resdvertlslng. tha bids for precisely W
thn samo vessels showed n great difference, n.
Whereas heloro tho llatn works had demand- '
ed 4780.000. tha Union Iron "1'urks of 8nu Hi
J-rnnclsco offered to build the throe for .If!
$081,007 each; the Dath Ironworks to build '111

for$1,2'jr,000: Harrison Lorlngot lloston nnd Us
tho Wulntard Ironworks ot Now York hit on
tho samo sum of $074,000 for one. There- m
suit was that the Ilaltlmorn firm got the Da- W
trolt and thn Montgomery for $012,000 each, l
nnd the f.orlngs. who made an arrangement a.V
with thn (Julntard works, rocelved the contract jVv,
tor the Mnrblehoad at $074,000. 'JrVl
This. It will bo seen, was n striking lllnstra- W.2a
tlon of the point mentioned by tho Secretary Tfj'
as to the chances of premiums being taken Wry
Into tho bidding. Tho now spoed premiums a
wero 325.000 hir each quarter knot of excess.
so that, with tho speed requirement reduced n

Tho trial of tho Detroit showed that tha V '
oiUlnal demand lor 18 knots was not excos-
slvn. Htm aehlovod tho great speed of 1,72 I
knots nhovo her contract requirements. As A I
frucllonK aliovo or below evenquartors are not fl
taken Into thn account, six quarter knots were a SI 1
allowed for. which made a premium of $150.- XM
000. Thero Is good reason to hopo thnt M
tho Marhlehead. wlilch Is now to be tried, will
do about as well, aud tn that case she may ex- .4 '1
poet a Uk premium, while, as has be-n seen. I'v'l
her contract price is $01,000 in excess ot that iti 1
of tho Dotrolt. wf

Tho Detroit, (It will bo remembered, was
found to Im somewhat topheavy In rough Ml

not lie much nbovo nine inches, Tha iUt- fjfii

It appears that some of the Ceylon tea plant- I

tain a sale for tholr tvaseed In the I.onclin
market A parcel of sevon bags of that article
was offered at tha drug sales recently, but no a
onm-oemed to know what to do with it. and 41
although the broker declared his belief that N
the drug was "a favorite medicine In China.' JM
tho audience remalnnd unmoved. Nevertha-
1sh. the tea seed might havo been worth pur- QH
chasing for thn sake of the bland oil which it fl
contains, to tho extent of about 35 per cunt. 5.1

about the size of a cherry stone, nubglohular in
In shape. And or a deep brown color. The oil IV
would be useful for burning or lubricating. Wi
