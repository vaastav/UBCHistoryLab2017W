We think that it r sately- claimed
that the Preside'"' message hat disappoint
td hit own friends. It was of course not
to be expected that his opponents would be
pleased, for party spirit rum no high that
xood partisanship demauda that a multi
tude of faults should be discovered in the
message by Democratic politician!. By
far the greater number of criticisms upon
it by Democratic and Republican journal
isU might as well have been written oeiure
. : I... ..'.JIm r,.ad
i aiter reaoing , ui-;.. o - ir
to censure, and the other to praise, n uiie
this is generally the case, there will here
and there be found a tfr-publicar. editor who
will withhold his praise, and a I'emocrai
who will take ploasure in commending some
portions of the message and withhold hii
censure of the rest But wa cannot believe
that the document really commend itself
s whole to thinking fair-minded Repub
licans. The tedious verboaeness of the message
no one was prepared for, for among both
parties and the whole people, the President
has been credited with a brevity and di
rectness of expression,, (wheu indulging in
en opinion), characteristic of the soldier
and almost peculiar to the President. H
inaugural in this respect met the public ex
pectation. The paper under review pos
sesses neither of these. In his inaugural
address, it will be rememdered that he an
nounced to Congress that he would enforce
the laws whether he liked them or not, and
that he would alwas have policy to recom
mend, but none to enforce against the will
of that body. Thii was intended as the
assumption of a virtue in himself, and at a
reflection upon his predecessor in oflice.
.. . fi-.. l,.. ;mm.i;t1ir I Is
lot) Bess. on vi itui", ....v ,u.hv -j i
followed the delivery of this address and hit
present message, illustrate to what extent
he has kept his pledge. Among his firtt
official acts was the appointment of an offi
cer who was not only disqualified by law to
act, but especially an un6t person, oo ac
count of the exact state of facts from which
the disiiualifviuir statute sprang, to perform I edy
with impartiality the duties of the office
' I
j
Not satisfied with this, he petitiontd Con
gress to virtually repeal, for his personal
gratification, this who'.esotnn i-Utute, than
which there is not a more reasonable enact
ment. Thin incident in his early oflioial
career illustrated at once bis devotion to hie
own plans auJ persotial preferences, and his
mistaku aj to the willingness of Congress to
second them.
The mPHeae before n fuiU so I'nr short
oi hitt pledge to nlwavs have a policy to
recomtueud, that the special instances of it
need scarcely 'o be jmiuted out. We must
not fail to do hiin the justice, however, to
acknowledge at lean one prominent and
gratifying rospect in which he makes a just
and needed recommendation, to wit : That
the State of Virginia, having complied with
the requirements of Congress, be mime
diately restored to her place iu the family
of States. There is, however, more than
an oiT sot for thia in hit recommendation as
to Georgia He advises that, notwithstand
ing this State has adopted a constitution,
Republican in form, and chosen State ofli
cers, and organized a civil government, and
performed all the acts required of it by
Conirrcss. vet he sutfireBts the wisdom ol
authorizing the Governor uf the Stale to
eonveue a defunct Legislature in the inter
ests of Itadiralism. He gives as a reason
for this, the fact that the Legislature of the
State, in violation of its constitution, o.v
Bubsrijuently tlr-clarnl by the Supreme Court
of the Mate, unseated several of its colored
members. He allows no credit to the Stnte
on account of the decision of the. SiiprotiH'
Court, but asks Coiifrres to virtually threw
the Statu into tha throes of a second recon
struction, because the Legislature did not
respect the right of colored meu to sent?.
Congress is thus appealed to to nuBert iu
supervisory control of tha Stale govern
ments of the. South for ull time. If this
doctrine is to prevail, a departure by any
one department of a southern State gov
ernment from the wi'.l of Congress, will
always and at any time subject the Slate to
Congressional doctoring, the evident inten
tion being to force those States to ( hooie
between perpetual broil with Congress and
a lull acceptauce aud adoption ol tlie lluu
ical creed.
On the Cuban question the Presi
dent is profusely vague. Ha evidently thinks
there is something to be said ou both sides
and is disposed to make both parties be
lieve they have worse enemies than himself.
On this subject be has no policy to recom
mend to Congress. lie is equally clear and
poiuted on taxation, tariff aud r vcuue
These questions being, of the very hifjhet
importanoe, could not be paired over in
silence, so he thinks something might with
propriety be done, hut to avoid any issue on
tho policy of reducing taxation and lessen
ing the evils of the tariff robbery, he sagely
sugiusts that these questions be postponed
till the next Congress niceta by which time
lie will have nscertaiued whether his parly
is decidedly in favor of one policy or
another, and being so advised, wilt of course
give a strong recommendation one way or
tne other. Ue manages to squeeze out a le
commendation tlist the income tax be re
newed and the rate reduced t.) three per
ce&t inst -sd of live.
1 he d-tttion of the Spanish jjtm boats le
half apologises for, and says he didn't fed
like linger detaining them on a mere Exe
cutive order, aud therefore the whole matter
had been nicely pigeoa holed into tho
Courts which would excuse him from having
any particular views on the question.
The Johnson Clarenden protocol for a
treaty between tnis country and England with
reference to the settlemen of the Alabama
claims, having been almost unanimously
rejected by the Senate, he thinks be is per-
fectW mle in assuring those who did it that
they were perfectly right. For anything
else he tays on the subject, tee Charlet
Snmner's tpeech to the Senate.
Hetayt vbe question of a reciprocity
treaty with Cana4 has not been "favorably
considered by this aow,in-,rtration,n though
" , he thinkt tome "arrangem-nt, for commer
cial intercourse between the u0 countries
N may be desirable " Thia will no Ocmbt sat

He farore return to a specie basis, and
hopei it will be "eomenced now and reached
at the earliest pouible moment, consistent
with a fair regard to the interest of the
debtor class." Yet he thinks "immediate
resumntiou if practicable, would not be de
sirable." The means of reaching the end
sought for are as numerous, he thinks, as
the speculations on political ecunoray, though
he ventures to say he sees but one way that
of the government redeem ing its Botes at their
(told value, and selling them again for goldj

Why does it Cure?
Because it is oomposed so!e)r of rare, disin
fectant, parif'ing and touic egetable substan
ces; because it penetrates the inflamed or ulcer
iivd floh thrcujrli and through ; because it
uikiIs, soothes nml tones the irritated surfnee ;
oecausi' It. is tho specific antidote of tbe acrid
poison which produces virulent sorns, b-dls, tu
mors, nnd nil eaternai exorescuocs ; ofcauso u
erndii-ates instead of suppressing eruptive and
ulcerous diseases.
Where it is Used?
Everywhere! There is not n civilized settle
ment between Alaska and Patagonia where it is
not appreointed. Well limy it be call.d a pene
trating preparation in a coiutncicial as web ns a
medical tense, tor, with its potent ally, llidlo-
wnv's Pills, it lis. reached (he centre of China
and tho heart of Japan, and is advertised nt Pc
km nnd Jcddo. Over three hundred millions ot
the human race that have never heard of any
other foreign medicine have been made acquaint
ed through their own papers, nnd many thous
ands of them hv actual experivnoe. with the
properties of Ilollowny's Ointment and Hollo-
way's Pills.
Open Sores and Unhealed Wonndi
lu oonseiiuence of being cicatrized before tbo
viru. of inflammation has been espelled, sores
supposed to have been cured often bresk out
afiesh. It iethesjtne witb old wounds. A thin
oi-Uft that deceives the eye overlies the moulder -
ing embers of disease, and they tire ns sure to
bnali through the surface eventually as a volca
no is to recommence us tbrocs and cast up new
Hoods of lava. Hut bo operation ol tile Oint
inert is final. All tho irritating humors are dis
pelled, ttnd when nature, tiins relieved, closes up
tho wound or utter, the cure is pertect.
To Eufforing' mothers.
The ngouy that some young mothers undergo
from tlie caking of milk in the hreiists, ulcers
tion of the nlpp e and other painful alTeotions of
tfie rramiltnry organs, is e strcine. Ana yet a
tew applications of the Ointment would remove
the dithouliy and emiblo the sullnrers to resume
the maternal function and continue to eiercise it
without interruption or pain. As the life of the
child as well as ihe health of Ihe mother may
depend on her ability to nurse it, this faot, which
is verified by ample testimony, should he treas
ured in the memory of every witoand matron
llerr orrhoids, Pulmonary disorders
Obstinate eases of piles that hare defied all
other treatment are often cured very rapidly rjy
tbe frequent application of tbi: Ointment to tbe
inflsined membrane. It must be used witb such
gentle friction s the i nt it lit can bear. When
rubbed briefly over tbe throat und chest, in bad
coughs and colds, asthma, ir.ilamtmr.inn of tbe
lungs, bronchitis, ulcerated sore tliroar, Ao., it
imparts wonderful relief and prevents tho com
