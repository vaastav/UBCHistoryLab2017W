The President’s Message.
The President’s annual message to
Congress was read before that body on
Tuesday. The message fills twenty col
umns of the average newspaper and uses
the new form of spelling recommended
by the Simplified Spelling Board. It
covers a wide range of public questions,
some much discussed, others not so much
considered by ,tbe public, and while it
will meet with hearty approval by most
of the President’s supporters it will no
doubt be just as severely criticized by
others not in accord with his views.
Opening with an allusion to our nation
al prosperity, a characteristic of the Chief
Executive is reflected in the closing des
ertatiou on the importance of the prepara
tion for war, a reflection of the big sties
policy also being seen in the recommen-1
dation for an increase in the fighting I
strength of our uavy.
The enactment of law prohibiting cam
paign contributions by the great corpora
tions of the country is a recommendation
which will find universal favor. Consid
erable discussion is also devoted to the
control of the great corporations, which
have become a public menace. Federal
supervision is urged, the bills passed at
the last session being highly commended
but further legislation insisted upon.
Government ownership does not find
favor with the President, as he says con
trol and regulation by the Government is
the best way to avert the very undesirable
move for the governmental ownership of
railroads.
The limiting of working hours of rail
road employes to eight hours is favored,
and the employment of children in fac
tories denounced as a crime.
Lower tariff or else absolute free trade
with the Philippines is desired, and the
admittance of Porto Ricans to citizenship
favored. The Japanese question, which
has been much before the people of late,
with war and other talk, is given a great
deal of space in the message, and the
Japs come in for unstinted praise, the
demand being made that these people be
pnt on the same footing with other for
eigners and given the right of naturaliza
tion as American citizens.
In order to reduce ‘'swollen fortunes” a
graduated tax on inheritances is recom
mended, and a graduated income tax.
While the President praises the present
Congress as having done more good work
than that of any other in our time he re
minds them more is needed and crowds
enough recommendations in bis message
to keep them busy for months to come.
Many other of the salient points might
be mentioned but elsewhere in this issue
the message will be found in condensed
form and the substance of it gleaned by
our readers without the reading of it in
its entirety, requiring possibly more time
than the majority of people would
devote to it.
Four bids were received and opened at
Washington for the supply of Chinese
labor for the Panama canal, the wage
figures ranging from nine to thirteen
cents (gold) per hour. For a ten-hour
day this would mean from 90 cents to
$1.30 per day. It is understood that this
is the rate at which the labor will be sup
plied by the contractors, and not the
amount which will be paid to the laborers
The United States will pay from nine to
thirteen cents an hour to the labor agent
for each of the coolies which he furnishes.
Tue laborer will receive what is left after
the labor agent deducts his commission,
which will probably be 25 per cent. The
laborers will receive from six to nine
cents an hour.
The President is back from the Panama
Canal and is literally iu the saddle, just
as much so when he sits at the Council
table surrounded by his Cabinet as when
he rides in the Park. As I have said
political wise acres predict a dull and for
mal session with no legislation to speak
of outside the appropriation bills. Con
gress doubtless expects to do nothing
much beyond this indispensable legisla
tion but there is a personage in the White
House, when he is not everywhere else,
who has little reverence for precedent and
not the slightesi fear of innovation. It
would be just like biui to ask Congress to
do several other things and recently Con
gress has gotten in the way of doing what
he asks, not altogether because be asks it
but because it is known that an unpre
cedented tnajorita of the people are at his
virile back and elbow. Therefore it is |
possible that since be has recently again i
and again reasserted that be will not have
third term he may try to make Con- j
gress work eight hours a day or over
time during his present term and enact
that legislation with regard to Santo Do
mingo. the Philippines, the inheritance
tax, the Panama Canal, and an elastic
currency, for which he has stood.
WASHINGTON LETTER.
The last session of the Fifty Ninth Con
gress will have convened by the time this
letter is in print and in spite of the pre
dictions that it will do nothing but pass
the appropriation bills there is a strong
probability that the session will be oue of
interest and will perhaps be a continua
tion of the strenuons legislation of the
first session. The Ship Subsidy bill which
has been up in several recent Congresses
only to be consigned to the grave of a
Committee, has a fair chance of being
passed. There is a strong public senti
ment even in the interior states and far
removed from either the Pacific, Atlan
tic or Gulf littorals in favor uf restoring
sea supremacy to the United States. The
| reason behind this sentiment is not
merely the promotion of American trade
I but a desire to enure American seamen in
order that we may have in time of war
that indispensable source for recruits to
our war vessels which has always given
England her supremacy on water aud has
recently enabled Japan to win the most
brilliant naval victories since the days of
Nelson. Secretaries Root and Shaw did
not give prominence to this phase of the
question iu their recent speeches. Their
plea was for a wider commerce on Amer
ican bottoms, but the menace of war
cloud already bigger than a man’s hand
in the East is sufficient to make it prudent
to mau our ships-and to have a reserve
such as can only be maintained in modern
times through an extensive subsidized
merchant marine.
***
The Post Office Department of the
United States under the management of
the present Postmaster General Cortelyou
is probably better conducted than it has
ever been in recent times. More irregu
larities within the Department have been
exposed and more frauds using the mails
as an auxiliary have been exposed than
in any recent or perhaps than in any pre
vious administration. Nevertheless the
Post Office Department of the United
States, like every other Department of the
Government, is loaded down with useless
live as well as useless dead material, the
establishment costs much more than is
necessary and people of the United States
who use the Post Office to a greater ex
tent per capita than any other people in
the world have to pay twice as much for
the service as they ought to be required
to pay. Mr. Boyce, the great publisher
of Chicago, has emphasized these undis
puted facts by proposing to take over the
entire postal service of the United States
and conduct it for one-balf the amount
that it is now costing the people, thus
saving the country probably from fifty to
seventy millions a year. But this is not
the only advantage that he and the pow
erful syndicate back of him hold out. He
proposes to reduce postage for letters to
one cent and to reduce the other three
classes of postage for mail matter in an
equal ratio. There is not the least doubt
that it can be done and with profit to the
contractors, and there is just as little
doubt that every other department of the
Government except perhaps the military
and naval departments could under priv
ate management be made more efficient
and much less expensive.

The Government Printing Office, that
mammoth asylum for pampered political
printers, has been in a state of turmoil all
summer. Few people in the United
States know how huge and corrupt this
excresence bad grown to be. IfTts nearly
three thousand employes were polled and
required to say what they thonght the
object of the Government Printing Office
was an overwhelming majority of them
would answer “to furnish salaries aud
places to the favored and elect of the
printing profession,” namely themselves.
It has been so long run as a kind of
eelymosynary institution that when Pres
ident Roosevelt appointed a real business
like, practical printer as its manager the
effect was like an explosive or a ferment
and the office has been iu a seething con- i
dition ever since. Printers from the j
outside and from the inside have used
every variety of persuasion and threat!
with the new Public Printer. The papers i
of Washington have taken the part of the '
great mass of spoiled and unruly employes \
because it is the popolar side and because !
the papers depend in great part upon ;
these people, their cousins, sisters aud
aunts for patronage, but, although the'
new man, Public Printer Stillings, has'
j been iu charge only ten months and
working under great disadvantage it is
known that he has saved hundreds of
thousands of dollars, and how he has
done it will soon appear iu a report now
ready for Congress.
Yearly Picture Talcing.
Some families make it a custom to
visit the photographer’s yearly, all go
ing together to sit for portraits singly
;>r in groups. It is a good custom, but
lias to be strictly observed or it may
begin to be honored in the breach. One
family permits no postponement of the
yearly trip to the photo gallery. A day
Is set, and every one must go. There
fire no penalties for nonattendance at
Hiis family reunion before the camera,
because there are no infringements of
the rule. The custom began, with this
family many years ago, when the first
baby came to It. Today It has a com
plete photographic record of family
life for almost a generation. Some of
the children are married and are now
photographed with their own children,
while death has made vacancies 1b the
later groups.—New York Press.
Another Story.
An aged Scotch minister, about to
marry for the fourth time, was ex
plaining his reason to an elder. "You
see, I am an old man now, and I canna
expect to be here verra lang. When
the end comes I wad like to have some
one to close my eyes.” The elder nod
ded and said, “Awell, meenister, I
have had twa wives, and baith of them
opened mine.”—London News.
One Valuable Asset.
“What’s the matter with the man in
the second story of this house? The
ioctor’s been coming here regularly for
'.'he past three months!”
"Oh, he’s the doctor’s best patient.
He doesn’t get well and he doesn’t
die!”—Philadelphia Inquirer.
A Texas Wonder.
There’s a Hill at Bowie, Tex.,
that’s twice as big as last year.
This wonder is W. L. Hill, who
from a weight of 90 pounds has
grown to over 180. He says “I
suffered with a terrible cough, and
doctors gave me up to die of Con
sumption. I was reduced to 00
pounds, when I began taking Dr.
King’s New Discovery lor Con- ‘
sumption, Coughs and Colds. Now
after taking 12 bottles, I have more
than doubled iu weight and am
completely cured.” Only sure!

Highest Observatory In the World.
The highest scientific station in the
world belongs to Harvard. It stands ■
on the summit of Mount Misti, an ex- j
tlnct volcano near Arequlpa, in south- j
ern Peru. The altitude of this station j
is 19,300 feet. No one lives at the
station. No one could live there. The
air is too rare and too cold. The bar
ometer ou the top of Misti often stands
at fourteen inches. The thermometer
often falls to 25 degrees below zero.
Once a month an observer climbs up
to the station to take the readings of
the Instruments. lie is two days
climbing up and two days climbing
down.

It Quiets
the Cough
This is one reason why Ayer’s
Cherry Pectoral is so valua
ble in consumption. It stops
the wear and tear of useless
coughing. But it does more
—it controls the inflammation,
quiets the fever, soothes, heals.
Ask your doctor about this.
