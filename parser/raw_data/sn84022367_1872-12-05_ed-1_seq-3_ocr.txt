'The death of Horace Greeley, at this
particular time, has brought into promi
nence the defects of our cumbrous
system of electing President, - A few
days since we detailed at length the sev
eral steps taken in our Presidential elec
tion, and, therein, stated that the sever
al electoral colleges would meet, to-day
and to-morrow to complete, on the part
of the people and electors, their parts in
the election. Now as the result of the
election on the fifth of November, the
. people of some States, virtually instruct
ed their electors to vcast the vote of their
respective States for Mr. Greeley. His
death, within five days of that time,
makes it impossible for them to thus re
cord the vote of their several States,
We cannot, for a moment suppose, that
they will, as has been suggested in some
liberal republican quarters, be guilty of
such an, act of childish yea, idiotic
policy as to still vote for Mr. Greeley
Such a vote would be a stultification of
themselves, an insult to the intelligence
of the American people, and anything
but a tribute of resneet to ahe dead. If
he were living, he would probably char
acterize such an act as idiotic, if not in
sulting to the dead. What then will they
do? To be sure, as it happens in this ease,
-TTniakesJio difference with the result.
It is a contingency, however, that has
never been thought of in our presiden
tial elections. It might occur the death
of Mr. Greeley has demonstrated its
more than probability that the cancii
date for whom the majority of the peo
ple ami States had. by their suffrages,
chosen, so far as the present constitu
tion and laws of the United States per
mits them to do so, as President of the
United States, might dij before the elec-
tors had . msiintmated the election. It
might occur. .: so late a uate mat con
cert of action on the part of the elec
tors representing the will of the people,
as expressed at the ballot box, would be
impossible, it might occur at a time
when the majoiity of the House of Rep
resentatives, voting by States, would
be in political accord w ith the majority
as pronounced at the ballot box. It
must hi1 remembered that if the major
ity of tin' electoral college should "scat
t r" tlicir votes that is, vote for differ
ent persons to such an extent that there
would be a failure to elect by the peo
ple, the election would devolve on the
then present House of Representatives,
and not on the one elected at the im
mediately preceding eiqrtion These
considerations, it seems to us, are of
themselves all-sufficient to demand of
Congress immediate steps, looking to
the alteration and simplification of the
machinery for the election of President
an 1 Vice-President.
We have, s yet, seen only two sug
gestions in reference to action proper to
be taken by thtHreeley electors," as
they are denominated, at their meetings
to-day and Wednesday, and these were
contained in our telegraphic dispatches,
yesterdaj' morning. One. comes from
Tennessee and proposes' '-that the
Southern States, which gave a third of
the electoral votes for the deceased,
give them in the electoral college tor
Grant in graceful and. under the cir
cumstances, appropriate acquiescence to
the overwhelming popular verdict of
November." This is a patriotic and sen
sible suggestion, evincing patriotism and
a desire for the complete restoration of
oeace, harmony and good will through
out the country. As it cannot, in any
manner, affect the result, it would be. as
the telegram suggests, "graceful ami Ap
propriate." The other shows the par
tisan spirit, and is anything but compli
mentary to the memory of Mr. Greeley
or respectful to that portion of his sup
porters with whom he was most materi
ally in accord. It calls, to be sure, for
concert of action on the part of the mi
nority electors, but ignores entirely the
right of the Liberal Republicans to he
heard in the premises. It does not even
propose to extend to them the courtesy
of asking for an expression of opinion
on their part. It proposes that
the national democratic commit
tee should express their opin
ion in the matter, and upon that
opinion, when expressed, they wou'd
undoubtedly act. But the worst feature
remains to be mentioned. While the
Republican party have buried past dif
ferences, have brushed aside the bitter
ness and asperities of the recent politi
cal campaign, and have united, almost
as one man, to render just honor and're
spect to Mr. Greeley as a man, a citizen
and a journalist, we rind the largest pro
portion of his recent political support
ers endeavoring to manufacture political
capital, for the future, out of his death.
Is this becoming to the character of the
American people? Has our politics
sunk to so low ft depth, and have our
ivolitieians become so degraded and such
mere seekers after political spoils, that
they should endeavor, before a man Is
laid away in his last resting place, to
turn it to political account, instead of
joining with the rest of the people yea,
with his political opponents in paying
a proper tribute of respect to his mem
ory. That it may be seen that we do
not exaggerate, we copy the concluding
portion of the Baltimore dispatch refer
red to : "Importance is attached to the
vote of Wodnesday, it seems, from the
hearing it may have on the nomination
tour- years hence. Hendricks name is
proposed ;in all the telegrams received
here. It is suggested that the national ,
tli niocratic committee should express its i
opinion.

cause, ( probably a broken rail ) the pas

jumped the track " and after turning.
completely over lodged upside down in
the ditch. There were in the coach at

Hutland and Silas Reed of Manchester,
fireman and engineer on the morning

"enmngtonon the early train for the pur
Pe of taking their regular train np, were
T"ry seriously wounded. Brutan was con
'iiltrably brui-ed about the head, and had
his face very much disfigured. The
physician in attendance is of the opinio
that his wounds, will not prove .fatal.
The track was torn up considerably, but
was speedily repaired and the noon train
was only five minutes late into Rutland.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
To the Senate and House of Representatives :
In transmitting to you, this, my fourth
annual message, It is with thankfulness to
the Giver ef all Good, that, as a nation, we
have been blessed, for the last year, with
peace at home and abroad, and a general
prosperity vouchsafed to but few people,
with the exception of the recent devasta
ting Are, which swept from earth with a
breath, as it were, Millions of accumulated
wealta in the city of Boston, there nas
been no overshadowing calamity within
the year to record. It is gratifying to note
how like their fellow-citizens of the city
of Chicago, under similar circumstances
a year earlier, tjie citizens of Boston are
rallying under their misfortune, and the
prospects that their energy and perseve
rance will overcome all obstacles, and
show the same prosperity soon, that they
would, had no disaster befallen them.
Otherwise we have been free from pesti-
lence, war and calamities, which often
overtake nations, and, as far as human
judgment comprehends the future, no
cause seems to exist to threatens our pres
ent peace. r
TREATY OF WASHINGTON.
When Congress adjourned, in June last,
a nnestion had been raised by Great Bri
tain, and was then pending, whioh, for a
time, seriously imperilled settlement by
friendly arbitration, of grave differences'
between this government and that of
Her Britamc . Majesty. which,
by the Treaty ' of Washington,
Had been reierreo. to tne tribunal of arm
tration, which had met "at Geneva, in
Switzerland. Arbitrators, however, dis-
posed of the question, which had jeopar
dized the whole treaty and threatened to
involve the two nations in most unhap
py relations toward each ether in a man
ner entirely satisfactory to the govern
ment, and in accordance with views of
policy which it had maintained. Tlie tri
bunal which had convened at Geneva, in
December, concluded its laborious session
on the 14th day of September last, on
which day, having availed itself of discre
tionary power given to it by the treaty to
award a full'compensation. It made it first
decision whereby it awarded the sum of
Sl.i.suo.ooo in gold as the indemnity to be
paid by Great Britain to the United States
for the ratification of all the claims re
ferred to its consideration. This decision
happily disposes of a long standing differ
ence between two governments, and in
connection with with another award made
by the German Kmperor, under a refer
ence to him. by the same treaty, leaves
these two governments without a shad
ow upon the friendly relations,
which it is my sincere hope may
remain forever equally unclouded.
Tlifi report of the agent "of the United
States, appointed to attend the Geneva
Tribunal, accompanied by protocols of
the proceedings of the arbitrators, the ar
guments of the counsel of both govern
ments, the award of the tribunal and the
opinions given by the several arbitrators,
is transmitted herewith. 1 have caused to
bo transmitted to the heads of the three
friendly powers, who complied with joint
request made to them under the treaty,
the thanks of t he government for the ap
pointment of arbitrators m-tde by them
respectively, and also my thanks to emi
nent personages named by them, and my
appreciation of the dignity, patience and
great ability with which they discharged
their arduous and high functions. Jler
Maiestv's government has communicated
to me its appreciation by Her Majesty of
the ability and indefatigable industry dis
played by Mr. Adams, the arbitrator nam
ed on the part of this government, during
the protracted inquiries and discussion-"
of the tribunal. I cordially unite with
Her Majesty in this appreciation. It is
due to the agent of the United states be
fore the tribunal to record my high ap
preciation of the marked ability, uiiiver-'
sal patience and the prudence and
discretion with which he lias con
ducted the very responsible and deli
cate duties committed to him, as it is also
due to the learned and eminent couns"l
who attended the tribunal, on the part of
this government, to express my sense of
talent and wisdom which thev brought to
bear in the attainment of' the result so
hanpily reached. It will be the province
of Congress to provide for the distribution
among those who may be entitled to it of
the respective shares of money to be paid.
Although tne sum awarueu is not payable
until a year from the date of award.it is
deemed advisable that no time be lo-t in
making appropriate examinations or'
several eases in which indemnification
may be due, I consequently recommend
the creation of a board of commissioners
for the purpose.
THK SAN J CAN QUESTION,
liv the 31th article of the Treaty of Wash
ington the respective claims of the Unit
ed States and of Grent Britain in their
construction of the Treaty of the 11th of
June, lSlti. denning the boundary line be
tween their respective territories were
submitted to the arbitration and award of
His Majesty, the Kmperor of Germany, to
decide which of these claims is most in
accordance with the true interpretation
of the Treaty of 1-SKi. His Mn.je.sty, the Km
peror of Germany, having been pleased to
undertake the arbitration, has the earne-t
thanks of this government and of the peo
ple of t he United States tor the labor, pains
and cave which he has devoted to the con
siders t ion of this long pending difference
I irive caused an expression of my thanks
to b' communicated to His Majesty. Mr.
Itancro t, the representative of the gov
ernment at, Berlin, conducted the case
and pit-pared the statement on tin
part of the United states, with
lino ability that his past services
lustified the public in expecting at his binds.
A member of the cabinet, at tle date of the
trentv, which has given rise to the discus
sion between the two trovernnients: as the
minister of Great Britain when the con
struction, now pronounced unfounded was
first Advanced and as the agent and repre
sentative of the government to present the
ense to receive the award, he has been hsso
ei.'Ked with the question in all its phases,
and, in every stage, has manifested a parti-
uiu zeal and earnestness m the maintain
ince of the claims of the United States. He
s entitled to much credit for the success
which has attended the submission. After
a patient investigation ot the cise and or
the statements of each prtv, His Majesty
the Kmperor, on the ilst day of October
Hst, signed his award in writing, decreeing
hat the claim ot the government of the
United States, that the loundry line be-
wecn the territories of Her Britamc Mul
es tv and the United States should be drawn
through the Hero Channel, or most in
accordance with the interpretation of the
ri-atv concluded on the lath of June. 1846,
between the agents of Her lintanic
Mniestv and of the United States.
Copies of the case presented on
behalf ol each government, and ot
the statement in reply of each and a trans
lation of the award are transmitted herewith.
This award confirms the United States in
heir claim to the important Archipelago of
stands Iving between the continent and
Van Couvers Island, which, for more than
twenty-six years, and ever since the ratih-
ation of the. treaty or Great uritain.wag
on tested, and leaves us tor the first time in
he history of the United States as a nation,
without a Question of disputed boundary
between onr territory and the possessions
if Great Britain on this continent, it is
mv grateiui amy to m-Kiiowieuge, tne
nromnt and spontaneous action of Her
Majesty's government in giving effect to
the award. in anticipation or anr request
from this government, and before the re-
certion in the United States of the award.
signed by the Emperor, Her Majesty had
given instructions lor the removal ot tier
troops, which had been stationed there, and
for the cessation of alt exercise of claim of
urisdiction,' so as to leave the United
States in the exclusive possession ot the
lately disputed territory. am gratified to
be able to announce that orders for the re
moval of the troops have been executed,
and the military joint occupation of san
Ju;in has ceased, Ttie islands are now in
he exclusive possession of the United
States. It now becomes necessary to cotn
nhte the survey, and determine that
portion of the boundary line through Hero
( hannel. upon which the commission,
which determined the remaining part or
the line, were unnblo to agree. I rocom.
i,inil tlin appointment of a commission,
to act jointly with one which may be
named by Her Majesty, tor that purpose.
The experience of the difficulties attend
the determination of our admitted
line of boundary, after the occupation of
the territory and Us settlement by those
owing allegiance to the respective gov
ernments points to the importance of
.utamlkiUlIlg UV llilliujitu uujwifl
monumentrthe actual line between the
ierrito ies acquired by us from liussia
and the adjoining possessions of Her Bri
?,.nin Majesty. The region is now so
narselv occupied and no conflicting in
tl rests of individuals or of jurisdiction are
likely to interfere to delay or embarrass
the actual location of the line. If deferred
until a population shall enter and occupy,
?he territory, some trivial contest ot
neighbors may again array the two gov
ernments in antagonism. I therefore
recmnmend the appointment of a commis
sion to Tact jointly Vith one that may be
S opoiiited on the part of Great Britain to
d?&nine the line between our .territory
of Alaska d Hie coterminous possessions
of Great Britain.

.,i Hint, the legislation iicucbhji.j "X
.J nf 'the United States to bring into
flsheiies ami J" L-nite(i mates toward
JSSBrituS Nortl AmericVssessions,
WcoiSS operatives as soon as proper
legislation ; should be had on the part of
Great Britain and its: possessions. ' This
j had not then been had, and, during the
session oi congress, a question was raiscu,
which, for the time, raised a doubt wheth
er any action by Congress, in the direction
indicated, would become important. This
Question has been disposed of, and I have
received notice that the Imperial Parlia
ment and the Legislature of tne Provincial
government have passed laws to carry the
provisions of the treaty, on the matters re
ferred to, into operation. I therefore re
commend your early adoption of legisla
tion in the same direction, necessary on
the part of this government. ...... -
! BOUNDAKT LINE.
The joint -commission for determining'
the boundary line between the United.
States : and the British possessions, be
tween the Lake of. the Woods and the
Rocky Mountains, has organized and en
tered upon its work. It is desirable that
the force be increased, in order that the
completion of the survey and the deter
mining of the line may be sooner attained.
To this end I recommend that a sufficient
appropi-iation be made, s ,- , ,
RELATIONS WITH. OTHER J'OEKIGX POWERS.
With France, our earliest ally, Russia, the
constant and steady friend of the United
States,' Germany, with whose government
and people we have so many causes of
friendship, and the other powers of En
rope, our relations are maintained on the
most friendly terms. .
Since my last annual message, the ex
change has been made of the ratification
of a treaty with, the Austro-Hungarian
Empire, relating to naturalization; also of
a treaty with the German Empire respect
ing consuls and trade marks ; also of a
treaty with Sweden and Norway, relating
to naturalization. All of which treaties
have been duly proclaimed.
INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL CONGRESS.
Congress, at itslast session, having made
an appropriation to defray the expenses
ot a commissioner on the part of the Unit
ed States to the international statistical
congress, at St. I'etersburgh. The persons
appointed in that character proceeded to
their destination, and attended the ses
sions of the congress. Their report will,
in due season, be laid before you. This
Congress meets at intervals of about three
years, and has held its session in several
of the countries of Europe. I submit to
your consideration, the propriety of ex
tending an invitation to the Congress to
hold its next meeting in the Unitted States.
The centennial celebration to be held in
187(5, would atford an- appropriate occasion
for such a meeting. Preparations are mak
ing for the international exposition, to be
held during next year at Vienna, on a scale
of very great magnitude. The tendency
of these expositions is in the direction of
advanced civilization and of the elevation
of industry, and of labor, and of the in
crease of human happiness, as e!las of
greater intercourse and good will between
nations. - As this exposition is to be the
first which will have been held
in Eastern Europe, it is believed that
American inventors and manufacturers,
will be ready to avail themselves of the
opportunity for the presentations of their
productions, if encouraged by proper aid
and protection. At the last session of
ongress, authority was given for the ap
pointment of one or more agents to repre
sent this government at the Exposition,
the authority then given, has been exer
cised, but in the absence ot any appropri
ation there is danger that the important
benefits, which the Exposition offers, will,
in a large degree, be lost to citizens of the
l-nifCu states. I commend the subject
strongly to your consideration, and recom
mend that an adequate appropriation be
made for the purpose, and to further the
American exhibition at the Vienna Expo
sition, Ij wonld recommend, in addition,
that tlie Secretary of the Navy be author
ized to lit np two vessels to transport, be
tween our Atlantic cities and Trieste or
the most convenient port to Vienna and
back, the articles for exhibition .
MEXICO. '
Since viir last session, the President of
the Mexican Republic, distinguished bv
his high character and by his services to
his country, h 's died. His temporary suc
cessor has now lieen elected, with great
unanimity, by the people, a proof of c n
tiden''eon their part in his vaTitisiu and
wisdom, which, it is believed, will be con
firmed by the results of his admiiiistra ion.
It is particularly desirable that nothing
should bo left undone, by the 'jovernments
of ei'her republic, to strengthen their -
lations as neighbors and friends. It, i
iniicli l b" regretted thu many lawle.-s
acts continue to ''isturb th quiet of tin-su-.ttlementu
on the border, between our
territory and that of Mexico, and that t he
complaints of wrongs to American citizen-1.

that, with ft more sett'ed nUe of orler

have been taken by the two governments,
which it is believed will prove successful.
The commissioners, appointed pursuant
to the joint resolution of Congress, of the
7th of Mtiv Inst, to mqntie into deprada-
tions on the Texas f outlet-, have diligent
ly made investigations in that quarter
Their report upon the subject will be coni
muniea'ed to you. Their researches were
nepossari'v interrupted, partly on account
of ftie limited appropriation made by Con
gress. Mexico, on the part of that govern
ment has appointed a similar commission
to investigate the outrages. It is not an
nounced officially, but the press of that
country states that the tu'lest investiga
tion is'desired, and that the co-operation
of all States concerned ue invited to se
cure that, end. I. therefore, recommend
that a special appropriation be made, at
the earliest, day practicable, to enable the
commissioners'on the part of the United
states, to return to their labors without
delay.
Cl'll A.
It is with regret that I have again to an
l.ounce a continuance of the disturbed
condition of the island of Cuba. No ad
vance toward the pacification of the dis
contented part of the population has been
made, while the insurrection has gained
no advantages and exhibits no niore of
elements of power or of the prospects of
ultimate success than were exhibited a
year ago. Spain, on the other hand, has
not succeeded in its repression, and the
parties stand apparently in the same rela
tive attitude which thev have occupied
for a long time past. This contest has last
ed now more than four years. Was its
scene at a distance from our neighbor
hood, we might be indifferent to its result,
although humanity could not be unmoved
by many of its incidents, wherever they
might occur. It is however at our door, and
I cannot doubt that the continued main
tenance of slavery in Cuba is among the
strongest inducement to the continuance
of the strife A terrible wrong is the na
tural cause of a terrible evil. The aboli
tion of slavery and the introduction of
other reforms, in the administration of
the government in Cuba, could not fail to
advance the restoration of peace and or.
dor. It is especially to be hoped that the
present liberal government of Spain will
eventually adopt this view, The law of
emancipation, which was passed more
than two years since, has remained unex
ecuted in "the absence of some regulation
for its enforcement. If, was but a feeble
step toward emancipation, but it was a
recognition of right and was hailed asucb,
and exhibited Spain in harmony with the
sentiments of humanitvand justice, and
in sympathy with the other powers of the
christian and civilized world. Within the
pant few weeks, regulations for carrying
out the law of Emancipation have been
announced, giving evidence of the sincer
ity of the intention of the present govern
ment to curry into effect the law of 1870. I
have not failed to urge the consideration
of the wisdom, the policy and the justice
of a more effective system for the aboli
tion of the great evil, whioh oppress
es a race and continues a bloody
and districtive contest close to our borders,
as well as the expediency and the justice of
coneeeding reforms, of which the propriety
is not questioned. Deeply impressed with
the conviction that the continuance of sla
very, as one of the most active causes of
the continuance of the unhappy condition
in Cuba, I regret to believe that citizens of
the United States, or those claiminq; to be
such, are large holders in Cuba of what is
there claimed as property, but which is for
bidden and denounced by the laws of the
United States. They are thus, in defiance
of the spirit of onr laws, contributing to the
continuance of this distressing and sicken
ing contest. In my last annual message, I
referred to this subject and I again recom
mend such legislation, as may be proper, to
denounce and, if not prevent, at least to
discourage American citizens from holding
or dealing in slaves.
SOUTH AMERICAN AFFAIRS.
It is gratifying to announce that the rati
fications of the Convention, concluded
under the auspices of this Government, be
tween Spain, on the one part, and the allied
Republics of the Tacific, on the other, pro
viding for an armistice, have been
exchanged, a copy of the Instrument is
herewith submitted. It is hoped that this
rmiy be followed by a permanent peace be
tween the same parties.
The difference which, at one time,
threatened the maintenance of peace be
tween Brazil and the Argentine Republic,
it is hoped, are in the way of satisfactory
adjustment. With these States, as with the
Republics of Central and South America,
we continue to maintain the most friendly
relations. It is with regret, however, that I
announce that the government of Venezuela
has made no further payments on account
of the awards, under the Convention of the
25th of-April, 1866. That Republic is under
stood to be now almost, if not quite, tran
quilized; it is hoped, therefore, that it will
lose no time in providing for the unpaid
balances of its debt to the United States,
having originated in injuries to citizens by
the Venezuelen authorities, and having been
acknowledged, pursuant to a treaty, in the
most solomu form known among nations,
it would seem to deserve a preference over
the debts of a different origin, and con
tracted in a different manner. The subject
Is again recommended to the attention of
Congress, for such action as may be deemed
proper. -, ....., ,.... ,. v-1. '),,
'. 'JAPAN. , . ...
Our treaty relations with Japan remain
unchanged.' An important embassy, from
that interesting and progresssive nation,
visited this country during the year that
is passing, but being unprovided with
powers for the signing of a convention iu
this country, no conclusion in that direc
tion, was reached. It is hoped, however,
that the Interchange ot opinions, which
took place during their stay in this coun
try, has led to a mutual appreciation of
our interests there. Our representatives
would not even then be placed upon an
equality with the l'epresentatives of Great
Britain and oi some other powers. As
now situated, our representees in Japan
and China-have to depend, for interpret
ers and translators upon natives of those
countries, who know our language imper
fectly, or procure for the occasion the
services of employes in foreign business
houses, or interpreters to other foreign
ministers. . '
MISCELLANEOUS. i
I renew the recommendation, made on a
previous occasion, of the transfer to the
Department of the Interior, to which they
seem more appropriately to belong, of all
powers and duties in relation to territor
ies, with which the Department of State
is now charged by law or by custom.
Congress, from the beginning of the gov
ernment, has wisely made provision for
the relief of distressed seamen in foreign
countries. No similar provision has, how
ever, hitherto been made for the relief of
citizens in distress abroad, other than sea
men. It, is understood to be customary
with other governments to authorize their
consuls to extend such relief to other citi
zens or subjects, in certain cases. A simi
lar authority and an appropriation are
.commended in the case of citizens of the
L nited States, destitute or sick, under such
circumstances. It is well known that such
citizens resort to foreign conntrjes in great
numbers, though most of them are able to
bear the expenses incident todocomotion,
there are some who through accident or
otherwise, become penniless and have no
friends at home ableo succor them. Per
sons in this situation must perish, cast
themselves upon the charity of foreign
governments, or be relieved at the private
charge of our own officers, who usually,
even with the most benevolent disposi
tion, have nothing to spare for such pur
poses. Should the authority and the ap
propriation asked forbe granted, care will
be taken to so carry the beneficence of
Congress into effect, that it shall not be
unnecessarily or unworthily bestowed.

great reduction of taxation, by the acts
of Congress at its last session, t lie expen
diture of the Government in collecting
the revenue will be much reduced
for the next, fiscal year. It is very doubt
ful, however, whether any further reduc
tion of so vexatious a brethen upon any
people will be practicable for the present.
At all events, as a measure of justice to the
holders of the nation's certificates of in
debtedness, I wonld recommend that no
more legislation be had on this subject,
unless it be to correct errors of omission
or commission in the present laws, until a
sufficient time has elapsed to prove that
it can be done and fetill leave sufficient
revenue to meet the current expenses of
the government, pay interest on the pub
lic debt and provide for the sinking mnd
established by law. The preservation of
our national credit is of the higest. impor
i anee. Next in importance to this comes a
solemn duty to provide a national curren
cy of fixed," unvarying value, as compared
with gold, and so soon as practicable, hav
ing tine regard tor the interests of the
debtor class and the vicissitudes of trade
and, convertible into gold at par.
WAR DEPARTMENT.
The report or ihe Secretary of War shows
the expenditures of the War Department
for the fiscal year, ending June 30, 1871, to
be 835,199.991.82, and for the, fiscal vear end
ing June 30, 1872, to be $35,372,157.2b, leaving
a reduction in favor of the last fiscal year
of $427,884..02. The estimate for military
appropriations for the next fiscal year
ending June 30, 1874, are $33,801,378.78. The
estimates of the Chief of Engineers are
submitted, separately, for fortifications,
rivers and harbor improvements, and for
public buildings and grounds and the
Washington aqueduct. The officers of the
Freedmen's ISureau have all been transfer
red to the War Department, and regula
tions have been put, into execution for the
speedy payment of bounties, pay, etc., due
colored . soldiers properly corning under
that bureau. All the war accounts
tor money and property, prior to 1871, have
been examined and transmitted to the
Treasury for final settlement. During
the fiscal year there has been paid for
transportation on railroads, $1,390,000, of
which $800,857 was over the Pacific rail
roads. Por transportation by water, $620,
373.52, and by stage, $48,975.84, and for the
purohase ot transportation animals, wag
ons, hire of teamsters, etc., eto , $942,050,64.
About $3.T0,000 have been collected from
Southern railroads, during the vear; of
this account there is $4,000,000 still due.
The Quartermaster has examined and
transmitted to the accounting officer, for
settlement, $367,172.72 of claims by loyal
citizens, for Quartermasters' stores taken
during the war. Subsistence and supplies
to the amount of $8,904,812 have been issued
to the Indians. The annual average main
strength of the army was 24,101 white and
2.494 colored soldiers. The total deaths,
for the year, reported were 367 white and
54 colored. The distribution of the medi
cal and surgical history of the war is yet
to be ordered by Congress. There exists
an absolute necessity for a medical corps,
of full numbers, established by the act of
July 28, 1806, there being now 59 vacancies
and the number of successful candidates
rarely exceeds eight or ten in any one
year.
The river and harbor improvements have
been carried on with energy and economy.
Though many are only partially completed,
the results have have saved the commerce
many times the amount expended The
increase of commerce with greater depth of
channels, greater security in navigation and
the saving of time adds millions to the
wealth of the country and increase the
resources of the government. The bridge
across the Mississippi river, at Rock Island,
has been completed and the proper site has
been determined upon for a bridge at La
crosse. The able and exhaustive report
made by the commission, appointed to in
vestigate the Tutro Tunnel, has been trans
mitted to Congress. '
The observations and reports of the
signal office has been continued. Stations
have been maintained at each of the princi
ple lake, seaport and river cities, and ten
additional stations have been established in
the United States, and arrangements Lave
been made for an exchange of the reports
with Canada, and a similar exchange of
observations is contemplated with the West
Indies. The favorable attention of Con
gress is invited to the following recom
mendation of the Secretary of War: A dis
continuance of the appointment of extra
lieutenants to serve as adjutants and quar
termasters ; the adoption of a code provid
ing a severe penalty for all well defi ned
Offences, so that inequality of sentences

TRANSPORTATION FROM THE WEST TO
THE SEABOARD.
The attention of Congress will be called.
during its present session, to various enter
prises for the more certain and cheaper
transportation of the constantly increasing
surplus of Western and southern products
to the Atlantic seaboard. I he subject is
one that will force itself upon the legislative
branch of the government, sooner or later,
and I suggest, therefore, that immediate
steps be taken to give all available informa
tion to insure equitable and just legislation
on the suDjeet. A route, to conneej the
Mississippi Valley with the Atlantic, at
Charleston, S. C. and Savannah. Ga., by
water, by way of the Ohio and Tennessee
Rivers and canals, and the slackwater
navigation to the Savannah and Ocmulgee
Rivers, has been surveyed and a report
made by an accomplished engineer of the
army. A second a tniru new routes will be
proposed fer the consideralion of Congress,
namely : by the extension of Kanowka and
James River canal to the Ohio, and by the
extension of the Chesapeake and Ohio
canal. I am not prepared to recom
mend government aid to these or other
enterprises, until it is clearly shown
that they are not only of na
tional interest, but that, when completed,
they will be of a value commensurate with
their cost. That production will increase
more rapidly than the means of transpor
tation iu our country has been demonstra
ted by past ex perience. That the unprece
dented growth in the population and the
whole country will require additional fa
cilities and cheaper ones, for the more
bulky articles of commerce to reach tide
water and a market, and will be demanded
in the near future is equally demonstrable.
I would, therefore, suggest that either a
committee or commission bo authorized
to consider t his whole question, and to re
port to Congress at some future day, fo
ils better guidance in legislation on this
important subject. The railroads of the
country have been rapidly extended dur
ing the last live years, to meet the growing
demands Of producers, and reflect much
credit upon the capitalists engaged i
their construction. In addition to these,
a project to facilitate commerce, by the
building of a ship canal around Niagara
Vails on the I'nited States side, which has
beenagitated for many years will nodonbt
be called to vour attention at this session,
booking to the great future growth of the
country, and the increasing demands of
commerce.it might be well, while on this
subject, not only to have examined anil
reported upou the various practicable
routes for connecting th Mississippi with
tide water on the Atlantic, but the feasi
bility of an almost continuous land-locked
navigation iroin Maine to the Uulf of
Mexico. Such a route along our coast
would be of great value at all times and of
inestimable value in case of a foreign war.
Nature has provided the greater "part of
this route and the obstacles to be overcome
are easily within the skill of the engineer,
and I have not alluded to this subject wirli
the view of having any further expendi
ture of public money, at this time, than
may be necessary to procure and place all
the necessary information before Congress
in an authoritative formtoenable it, here
alter if deemed practicable and worthy, to
legislate upon the subject without delay.
NAVV DEPARTMENT.
The report of the secretary of the Navy,
herewith accompanying, explains fnliy
the condition of that branch of the public
service, its wants and deficiencies, ex
penses incurred during the past year, and
appropriations for the same. It also gives
a complete history of the services of navy
for the past year, 'in addition to its regular
service. It is evident, that unl-ss steps
are taken to preserve onr navy, that, in a
tew years, the United States "will be the
weakest nation, upon the ocean, of all the
great powers. With (in energetic, progres-
sional, business people, like oius, pene
trating and forming business relations
with every part ot the known world, a
navy, strong enough to command the
respect of our flag abroad, is necessary for
the full protection of their rights. I recom
mend the careful consideration by Con
gress ot the recommendations made by
the Secretary of the Navy.
POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
The accompanying report of the Post
master Geneial furnishes a full and satis
factory exhibit of the operations of the
Post Office Department during the year.
The ordinary revenue of that Department
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1872,
araonted to 21.915,426.37, and the expenui
ture $26,658,192.31. Compared with the
previous fiscal year, the increase of revenue
was SI ,S7S,360,95, or 9 3-7 per cent., and the
increase of expenditure $3,268,083.23, or 9
2-9 per cent. Adding to ordinary revenue
the annual appropriation of 700,000
for free matter, and the amount paid to
subsidised mail steamship lines, from
special appropriations, the deficiency piid
out of the general treasury was ij!S,387.705.
94, an excess of $389,707.28 over the de
ficiency for the year 1872. Other interest
ing statistical information relating to our
rapidly extending postal. service is furnished
in this report. The total length of railroad
mail routes, on the SOth of June, 1872, was
57,911 miles, 8,077 additional miles having
been put into operation during the
year. Eight new lines of railway post
offices have been established, with an ag
gregate length of 2,909 miles; the number
of letters exchanged in the mails with for
eign countries was i!4,3t4,500, an Increase of
4,066,50-2 or twenty-five per cent over the
number in 1871, and the postages thereon
amounts to $187,133,727; the total weight of
mail exchanged with European countries
exceeded 820 tons I the cost ot the United
States transatlantic mail steamship ser
vice was 220,301.70; the total cost of the
United States ocean steamship service, in
cluding amount paid to subsidised lines of
mail steamers, was $102,702,097. The fol
lowing are the only steamship lines now
receiving subsidies for mail service, under
special acts of Congress : the Pacific Mail
steamship uompany receive SoOO.000 per
annum for conveying a monthly mail be
tween San Francisco, Japan and China,
which will be increased to 8100,000 per an
num for a semi-monthly mail on and after
October 1, 1873 ; the United States and Bra
zil Mail Steamship Company recive $150,000
per annum for conveying a monthly mail
between New York and Kio De Janeiro,lSra
zil, and the California, Oregon and Mexico
steamship company receive 875,000 per an
num. Our postal communications with all
ports of the civilized word, have been
placed upon a most advantageous footing
by the improved postal conventions and
arrangementsrecently concluded with the
leading commercial countries of Kuropo
and America, and the gratifying statement
is made that with the conclusion of a sat
isfactory convention with France, the de
details of which have been definitely
agreed to by the heads of the French pos
tal department, subject to the approval of
the mmiter of finance, little remains to be
accomplished by treaty for some time to
come, with respect either to reduction in
rates or improved facilities of postal in
tercourse. Your favorable consider
ation is respectfully invited to the
recommendations made bv the post
master General for an increase of service,
from monthly to semi-monthly trips, on
the mail steamship route to Brazil, and for
a subsidy to ensure the establishment of
an American line ot mail steamers between
San Francisco, New Zealand and Austra
lia ; tor the establishment of a post office,
savings banks, and for increase of sala
ries ot lhe heads of bureaus. I have here
tofore recommended the abolition of the
franking privilege, and see no reason now
for changing my views of that subject, it
not having been favorably regarded by
Congress, however, I now suggest a modi
ficatioa of that privilege, to correct its
glaring and costly abuses.
POSTAL TELEGRAPH.
I would recommend, also, the appoint
ment of a committee or commission to
take into consideration the best method,
equitable to private corporations, who
have invested their time and capital in
the establishments of telegraph lines, of
acquiring the title to all telegraph lines in
operation and of connecting this service
with the postal service of the nation. It
is not probable that this subject could re
cieve the proper consideration during the
limits of a short session of Congress, but
it may be initiated, so that further action
may be fair to the government and to pri
vate parties concerned. ; ..;,
j- OCEAST STEAMSHIP LINES. , '
There are but three lines of ocean steam
ers, namely : The Pacific Mail Steamship
Company, between San Francisco, China
and Japan, with grovision made for semi
monthly service after Oct. 1, 1872; the
united states ana Brazil line, (monthly)
and the California, New Zealand and Aus
tralian line, (monthly) plying between the
United States and . foreign ports, owned

the western South American ports. By
this means, much trade, now diverted to
otner countries, might be brought to us,
to the mutual advantage of this country.
and those lying in that quarter of the con
tinent of America. The report of the Sec
retary of the Treasury will show an alarm
ing laiiingon in the carrying trade for the
last ten or twelve years, and even for the
past year. I do not believe that the pub
lic treasure can oe oener expended in the
interest mt the whole people, than in try-

of $5,000,000 per annum, for the next five
years, if it would restore to ns our pro
portion of the carrying trade of the world,
would be profitably expended. The price
of labor in Europe has so much enhanced
within the last few years, that the cost of
uuij jiiiK anu. u-jemiin'; ocean steamers in
the United States is not so much greater

DEPARTMENT OF JC8TICE. "
Detailed statement of the disburse.
ments through the Department of Justice
will be furnished by the report of the At-
lorney-Lenerai, tnougn tnese have been
somewhat increased, by recent acts of
Congress, to enforce the rights of citizens
of the United States, to vote in the several
States of the Unin and to enforce the pro
visions of tlie 14th amendment to the Con
stitution of the United States, and amend
ments thereto, I cannot question the ne-
nessity or salutary effect of tJese enact
........ . . i , .... 1. 1 . . i , i w .
uit;jii.n. jtTCK.ir uiiu lawless men, l re
gret to state, have associated themselves
together in some localities to deprive other
citizens oi tiifc l iguts guaranteed to them
bythe Constitution of the United States and
to t uat end, nave committed deeds of blood
and violence, and the prosecution and
punishment of many of these persons have
tended greatly to the repression of such
disorders. 1 do not doubt that a great ma
jority of the people inallpartsof the coun
try favor the full enjoyment by all classes
ot persons ot t hese rights, to w
h it'll they
are entitled under the constitution and
laws, and I invoke the aid and influence of
all good citizens to prevent the organiza
tions, whose objects are. by unlawful
means, to interfere with those rights, and
look with confidence to the time, not far
distant, when the various advantages of
good order and peace will induce an aban
donment ot all combinations prohibited
by the acts referred to, and when it will be
unnecessary to carry on prosecutions or
inflict punishments to protect citizens
from the lawless doings ot such combina
tions. Applications have been made to
me to pardon persons, convicted of a vio
lation of said acts, upon the ground that
clemency in such cases would tend to
tranquilize the public mind; and to test
the virtue of that policy, I am disposed, as
far as my sense of justice will permit, to
irive to those applications a favorable con-
sidcration.but my action therein is not to
oe construed as indicating any chanire in
my determination to enforce with vigor
such acts as long as the conspiracies and
combinations therein named disturb the
peace of the country. It is as much to be
rejf retted, and is regretted by no one more
than myself, that the necessity has ever
xisted to execute the enforcement act.
, one can desire more than I that the ne
cessity of applying it may never again be
uenianoed.
INTERIOR. DEPARTMENT.
The Secretary of the Interior reports
satisfactory improvement and progress iu
each of the several bureaus, under the con
trol of the Interior Department. ' Thev are
ill in excellent condition. Work, which,
n some of them for some years has been
n arrear. has been Orou-fiu down to a
recent date, and all the current business has
been promptly dispatched.
, THE INDIA! POLICY.
The policy, which was adopted at the be
ginning of the administration with regard
to the management of the Ind!aiis, has been
as successful as its most ardent friends anti
cipated within so short a time. It has re
duced the expense of their management,
decreased their forages upon the white
settlements, tended to give ttie largest op
portunity for the extension of the great
railways through the public domain, and
the pushing ot settlements in the more
remote district of the country, and,
at the same time, improve the con
dition of Indians. The policy will be
maintained, without any change, except
ing sue h as further experience may show to
be necessary, to render it more efficient.
The subject ef converting the so-called
Indian territory, south of Kansas, into a
home for Indians, and erecting therein a
territorial form of government, is one of
great importance. As a compliment tu the
existing Indian policy, the question of their
removal to the territory has, within the
past year, been presented to many of tlie
tribes resident upon other and less desir
able portions of the public domain, and has
generally been received by them with favor.
As a preliminary step to the organization of
such a territory, it will be necessary to con
fine the ' Indians now resident thereon, to
farms of proper size, which should be se
cured to them in tee, the residue to be used
for the settlement of other friendly Indians.
Efforts will be made in the immediate future
to induce the removal of as many peaceably
disposed Indians cely to the Indian ter
ritory, as can be settled properly, without
disturbing the harmony of those already
there. There is no other location now avail
able where a people who are trj ing to acquire
knowledge of t lie pastural and agricultu
ral pursuits, can be as well accommodated
as uon unoccupied (lands in the Indian
territory. A territorial government should,
however, protect the Indians from the in
roads of the whites, for a terra of years,
until the become sufficiently advanced in
the ,arts and civilization ,to guard their
own rights, and from the disposal of the
lands held by them for the same period.
PUBLIC LANDS.
During the last fiscal year, there were
disposed of, out of the public lands, 11,864,
975 acres a quan ti ty greater by 1,01KI,270 acres
than was disposed of the previous year.
Of the amount, 1,370,3J0 acres were sold for
cash; :kiii,4ii0 acres located with military
warrants, 4,K71,;ti2 acres taken for home
steads, ('9:,0i: acres located with college
scrips, 3,354,i!W7 acres granted to railroads,
41 15347 acres granted to wagon roads, 714,
ihb acres given to States as swamp land
and 5,700 acres located by Indian scrips.
The cash receipts, from all services, in the
Land Office amounted to $3,218,100. During
the same period, '22,(il(i,G'8 acres of
the public lands were surveyed,
whicn, added to the quantity be
fore surveyed, amounts to 5s3,.104,7S0 acres,
leaving l,'2j7,633.tj-'8 acres of the public lands
still unsurveyed. The reports from the
subordinates of the land office, contain in
teresting information in regard to their
respective districts. They uniformly men
tion the fruit fulness of the soil, during the
past season, and the increased yield of all
kinds of produce, even in those "states and
territories where mining is the principal
business Agricultural products have ex
ceeded the local demand, and liberal ship
ments have been made to distant points.
!
PATENT OFFICE.
During the year ending September 30th,
there were issued from the Patent Office
13,626 patents, 232 extensions and 556 certi
ficates of registry of trade marks. During
the same; time, i9,5S7 applications for pa
tents, including reissues and designs, have
been reeeived,and 3,100 caveats filed. The
fees received during the same period
amounted to $070,954.86. and the total ex
penditures to S6153.'J0, making the net
receipts, s over exjieBditures, 877,400.96.
Since 1863, 200,000 applications have been
filed, and about 13.300 patents issued. The
office is being conducted under the same
laws and general organization as were
adopted at its original inauguration, when
only from one hundred to two hundred
applications were made per annum. The
commissioner shows that the office has
outgrown the original plan and that a new
organization has become necessary'. This
subject was presented to Congress in a
special communication in February last,
with myapproval and with the approval
of" the (Mjcretary of the Interior, and the
suggestions contained in said communica
tion were embraced in a bill that was re
ported to the House by the committee on
patents at the last session. The subject of
the reorganization of the Patent Office, as
contemplated by the bill referred to, is one
of such Importance to the industrial inter
ests ot the country that I commend it to the
attention of Congress. The commissioner
also treats tbe subject of the separation of
the Patent office from the Department of
Interior. I This subject is also embraced in.
the bill heretofore referred to. The com
missioner complains of want of room for a
model gallery and for the working force
and necessary files of the office. It is im-
Sossible to transact the business of the of
ce properly, without more room in which
to arrange fi'es and drawings that must
be consulted hourly in the transaction of
business. The whole of tbe Patent Office
building will soon be needed, if it is not
already, for the accommodation of the
business of the Patent Office.
...,. f ' PEKSIOWS. ' ' "'
The amount paid for pension, in the last
fiscal year, was $30,169,340, . and amount
larger by $3,708,434 than was paid during
the preceding year, of this amount $2,313,
409 was paid, nnder the act of Congress of
February 17th, 1871, to survivors of the war
of 1812. The annual increase of pensions,
by legislation of Congress, has more than
kept pace with the national yearly losses
from the rolls. The act of .Congress of
June 18th, 1872, has added an estimated
amount of. $750,000 per annum to rolls with
ont increasing the number of pensioners
we cannot, therefore, look for any substan
tial decrease in the expenditures of this de
partment for some time to come, or so long
as Congress continues to so change tbe rates
of pension. The whole number of soldiers
enlisted in the war of the rebellion was
2,688,523; tbe total number of claims for
invalid pensions is 176,000, being bnt six
per cent, of tbe wbole number of enlisted
men. Tbe total number of claims on hand
at tbe beginning of the year was 91,689; the
number received daring the year was 26,
574; the numbor disposed of was 89,178,
making a net gain of 12,604;
The number of claims, now on file, is
70,085. On the 80th of June, 1872, there were
on the rolls, the names of 95,406 Invalid
military pensioners, 113,518 widows and
orphans and dependent relatives, making
an aggregate of 208,923 army pensioners.
At the same time there were on tbe rolls,
the names of 1,440 navy pensioners and
1,730 widows, orphans and dependent rela-
tives, making the whole number of naval
pensioners 3,179. There has been received.
since the passage of the act to provide in
stitutions for the survivors of the war of
1812, 3,655 applications prior to June 30,
1872. Of these there were allowed, during
the last fiscal year, 20,126 claims, 4,845 were
rejected, during the year, leaving UU5S0
claims pending at date. The number of
pensions of all classes, granted during the
last fiscal. year was 33,838. During that
period there were dropped from the rolls,
for various causes, 9,104 names, leaving a
grand total of 232,229 pensioners on the roll
on tbe 30th of June, 1872. It Is thought that
the claims for pensions, on account of the
war of 1812, will all be disposed of by the
1st of May, 1873. It is estimated that $30,
430,000 will be required for the pension ser
vice during the next fiscal year.
) - THE CENSUS. ' '
The ninth census is about completed.
Its early completion is a subject of con
gratulation, inasmuch as the use to be
inane of statistics tnerem contained, ae.-,
pends very greatly upon the promptitude I
of their publication. The Secretary of In
terior recommends that a census be taken
in 1875. which recommendation should re
ceive the early attention of Conerress. The
interval, at present established between
the federal census, is so long that the in
formation obtained at decimal periods, as
to the material condition, wants and re
sources of the nation, is of little prac
tical value, after the expiration of the
flrsthalfof that period. It would probably
obviate the constitutional provision re
garding the decennial census, if a census
taken in 1875 should be divested of all po
litical character, and no reapportionment
of congressional representation be made
upon such census. Coming as it would, in
the last year of the first century of nation
al existence, would furnish a noble monu
ment of the progress of the United .States
during the ceutury. . .
EDUCATION.
The rapidly increasing Interest in educa
tion is among the most encouraenng fea
tures of the current history of the coun
try and it is no doubt true
that this is, in a great measure,
due to the efforts of the bureau
of education. That office is continually re
ceiving evidences, which abundantly
prove its efficiency, from the various mst i-
tutions of learning and education of all
Kinus tnrougnout tne country, me re
port contains a vast amount of edu
cational details of great interest. The bill
now pending before congress providing
for the armronriation of the net proceeds
of the sales of public lands for educational
purposes, to aid tne states in tne general
education of the rising generation, is a
measure of such great importance to our
real progress, and ! so unanimously ap
proved by the leading friends of educa
tion, that I commend it to the favorable
attention of Congress.
THE TEKBITOBIES.
he ajfairs in the territories are gene
rally satisfactory. The energy and business
capacity of tbe pioneers, who are settling
up the vast domain not yet incorporated
nto states, are keeping pace in external
mprovements and civil government with
the older commnnities In but one of them,
Utah, is tbe condition of affairs unsatisfac
tory. Except as so far as the quiet of
society mav be disturbed by the real or
maginary dangers of Indian hostilities. It
Iihs seemed to be the policy of tbe
Legislature of Utah to evade all resoonsi-
tility to the Government of the United
States, and even to hold a position in hos
tility to it. I recommend a careful revision
of the present laws of the territory, by Con
cress, and tbe enactment of such a law as
the one proposed in Congress at its last
session, tor instance, or somethiog similar
to it, as will secure forever the equality of
all citizens before the law, and the ultimate
extinguishment of polygamy.

Willi me I'liieiio ui viw uuini'i a just

ments. I recommend, therefore, an ap
propriation to reimburse the citizens for
the work done by them along and in front
of the public grounds, during the past
year, and liberal appropriations in order
that the improvement and embellishment
of the public buildings and grounds may
keep pace with the improvements made
bj- the territorial authorities.

manner in which the farmer.the merchant
and the miner is informed, and the extent
to which he is aided iu .his pursuits. The
commissioner makes one recommenda

planting ot forests, ana also sug
gests that no part ot the public lands
should be disposed of, without the condi

not exist, inducements should be offered
for planting it.
THE CEXTEXXlAL.
In accordance with the terms of the act
of Congress, approved March 3. 1K71, pro
viding for the celebration of the looth an
niversary of the American Independence,
a commission has been organized, consist
ing of two members from each of the
States and territories. This commission
has held two sessions and has made
satisfactory progress in the organization.
and the initiatory steps necessary for car- I
rying out tne provisions or tne act, ana
for executing, also, the provisions of the
act of June 1, 1871, creating a centennial
board of finance. A preliminary report of
tneir progress nas oeen receivea, irom tne
president of tbe commission, and is here
with transmitted. It will be the duty of
tne commission, at your comming session,
to transmit a full report of the progress
made and to lay before you the details re
lating to the exhibition of American and
foreign arts, products and manufactures.
wnicn. bv tne terms onerea. is to be held
under tne auspices of the government
of the -L nited States, in the city of
Philadelphia, in tbe year 1876. lhe cele
bration will be looked forward to by Ameri
can citizens with great interest, as mar king
a century of the greatest progress and pros
perity that is recorded in the history of any
other nation, proving a further good pnr- ;
pose in bringing together, on our sou, tbe
people of all tbe commercial nations of the
earth, in a manner calculated to secure in
ternational good feeling.
, CIVIL SERVICE BEFORM. ,
An earnest desire has been felt to correct
tbe abuses which have grown up In civil
service of tbe country, through tbe defec
tive method of making appointments to
office. Heretofore, federal offices have
been regarded too much as the
rewards political service Under 'the au
thority of Congress, rules bave been estab
lished to regulate tbe tenure of office and
the mode of appointments. It cannot be
expected that any system of rules can be
entirely effective and prove a perfect rem
edy for existing evils, until tbey have been
thoroughly tested by actual practice: and
amended according to tbe requirements of
service. During my term of office, it shall
be my best endeavor, to so apply rules to
to secure the greatest possible reform in
the civil service of the government, but it
will require the direct action of Congress,
to render the enforcement of the system
binding upon my successors, and I hope
that the experience of the past year, to
gether with appropriate legislation by
Congress, may reach a satisfactory solu
tion oi in is question, ana secure to tne
Dublie service, for all time, a practical
method of obtaining faithful and efilclnt
officers and employes.

The JUiasi off Henlncklan.
..,; jFromthc New York Times, 27th. "f ,
On Saturday last tlie Time published
exclusively a new and startline theory
in regard to the mysterious disappear
ance of George ,N. Peay of Louisville,
in which it was stated, on the authority
of detective Tilly of the Central office,
that the missing Kenruckiaa was a vol
untary absentee, and had probably tak-
i i r i. k :
- en departure for some South Ameri-
can port.' This theory, which was dis
believed by the missin? man's friends,
received yesterday confirmation through
the' agency tof detective Bligh of the
Louisville detective force. Mr. Bligh
had come to this city . to . advise with
the New York police authorities in re-
gard to the search for his missing friend,'
and, after going over the whole ground,
became convinced that the Timet theo
ry in regard to j. his disappearance was
Srobably . the correct one. .,. Yesterday .
Ir. Bligh received a dispatch from Lou
isville : containing information which
tends strongly to confirm that view of
the case. It appears that a H. IL Neal
a clothing merchant on Fourth street,.
Louisville, Ky., became bankrupt, and, .
as he owed a considerable amount of ,
money in the city, some of his friends
combined to help him. Among these'
were Messrs. Davidson, Ryan and Geo.
0. Buchanan of Louisville, and David
son came on to this ity to effect a set
tlement with the creditors, and, succeed
ed in obtaining their consent to take fif
ty cents on the dollar of the amount due
them. He wrote on to Mr. Ryan to :
send to each of the creditors ot Mr. Xeal
a check for the amount of their respec
tive claims. In the meantime, Mr. Peay,
who had appeared to take great Interest
in the matter, went to Mr. Ryan and
said that as he was going to New York
he would see what he could do to settle
the matter, satisfactorily. Mr. Ryan,
having : the utmost confidence in Mr.
Peay, assented to the arrangement.
Mr. Davidson left New York the same
day that 3Ir. Peay arrived." Tbe latter
called on Mr. Vaningen, a cloth mer
chant, at the corner of Broome 6treet
and Broadway, and said he had been de
puted to settle 31 r. Neal's business diffi
culties. - He was informed that Mr. Da
vidson had already settled lhe matter, as
stated above. The Louisville merchants,
having perfect faith in Mr. Peay, sent
him the checks with which to settle Mr.
Neal's debts. The checks were subse
quently returned to Mr. Ryan, with a
request that a draft for the whole amount
$ 4,700, should be sent him in his own
name, as he thought he could secure a
better settlement. Not having any rea
son to doubt the sincerity of Peay, the
draft was sent to him. . Instead of hav
ing it cashed by application to merchants
in this city, with whom he was acquaint
ed, Peay obtained the money from a
31 r. Courtney, in Brooklyn, a relative of
his wife, and then disappeared, without
having attempted to pay the money to
those for whom it was intended. When
3Ir. Courtney presented the draft to the
bank on which it was drawn, payment
was refused, as the parties in Louisvillo,
having become suspicious of the delay,
had telegraphed on to stop the draft. A
day or two ago detective Eligh, who had
come to this city in the interest of 3Ir.
Buchanan, who had been chiefly instru
mental in furnishing the money for 3Ir.
Neal, telegraphed on his suspicions that
Peay had absconded with the money,
and requesting that a tin box said to
contain 25.000 in cash, bonds and other
securities of 3Ir. Peay, which he had
deposited with a banking house in Louis
ville, should be opened and examined.
Mr. Buchanan proceeded to attach 3Ir.
Peay's property, and obtained an order
from the Court to open and examine the
contents of the lox. This was accord
ingly done, and the receptacle was found
to contain nothing but an old account
book. As Mr. Peay was the only per
son who had a key to this box, it is fair
to presume that its former contents are
in his possession. This has confirmed
the former impression of tbe detectives
that Peay has absconded with the
money, and his friends and acquaintan
ces in this city are reluctantly accepting
this view of the matter.
A TroublfMme Postmaster.
From the Tribune. .
They are having a lively time in the
Covington. Ky., Postoffice. Jesse R.
Grant, father of the President, is the
Postmaster ; but, owing: to his inability
through sickness to attend to his duties,
Shadford Easton was, last January, ap
pointed special agent, with instructions
from the President to discharge all the
duties of Postmaster, and be held re
sponsible for the management of the of
fice. Sir. Easton took possession during;
Mr. Grant's illness, and at once ordered
several needed improvements and altera
tions. When the venerable Postmaster
recovered sufficiently to visit the office,
he soundly Iterated Mr. Easton for the
expenditure he bail made, and upon the
latter remonstrating against the violent
epithets showered upon him, Mr. Grant
lifted his cane and struck him. After
that, matters were quieted down for a
time, although Mr. Easton has repeated
ly expressed his determination to resign
rather than be Fubjected to Mr. Grant's
irascible temper. On Saturday lat the
quarrel broke out afresh. Mr. Grant
renewed his attack upon Mr. Easton,
demanding his withdrawal from the of
fice. In an interview with a reporter of
the Cincinnati Commercial, Mr. Easton
said he did not think Mr. Grant would
resign, although the President wished
him to do so. In response to an inquiry
as to the probability of the President re
moving his father, Mr. Easton said :
"Really, fir, I do not know. I hardly
think the President wi'.l remove hia
father, though he may. He is a very
peculiar man, when he once gets his
head set, and ten times as obstinate as
bis sire, j He would doubtless prefer that
the old gentleman should remain in the
office until the expiration of his present
term, as I would, if be could be made
to behave himself. But his retention
is now In-come a public ecandal, and no
one, I am convinced, feels it more than
the President. For my own part, I am
under heavy bonds to do my duty; and
must remain, however unwilling. I era '
certainly in a moet uncomfortable po
sition, and would gladly escape from it
if I could."
The following letter was written by
the President when Mr. Easton first
tendered his resignation :
ExEcrmvE Mavstov, Wasiiixgton
Citv, Sept. 4, 1872. Jy Dear Mr.
Eantonr I have just received your let
ter inclosing your resignation as Special
Agent in charge of the Covington Post
office, with the reasons therefor. I beg
you to suspend action in the matter for
the present. T regret very much that
my father should attempt to interfere in
your management of the office. I shall
write him at once to desist, and to send
me his resignation, as-1 am satisfied
he will never again be competent to
discharge the duties of the office.
Very truly your friend,
: r U. S. Gbakt.
