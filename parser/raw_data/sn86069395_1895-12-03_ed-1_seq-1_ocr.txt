fo James D llmclc
BARBoohsviLLE Kt Nov 29 His
constituents here are gossiping about
a report tbtfio effect that Ropresen
tativo elect W R Black of this
place may play a more importait
part in thevnamiug of a successor to
Jo C 9 Blackburn next January
than hb habeen expected to play
Black is jh Republican and his un
cle James D Black also of this
place was one of theKentuckyBoard
of Worlds fFair Commissioners ap
pointed by iGov Brown The Hon
James DiBlack is a prominent Dem
ocrat anujjmany umoa oeioro iuo
State Democratic Convention last
qiimmftr hftwaH iriftnttonivl hh a can
didate for governor as a- compromise
between Clay and Hardin
The report here given for what it is
worth is that Representative elect
Black proposes if he finds such a
thing possible on accouut cf the
nearly evenly divided forceti in the
House and Senate to induca the
Democrats when they find they can
not without Republican support elect
one of theirjown party to support the
Hon James D Black and will show
his good fath in the matter by voting
for hisoincle at the same time there
by naming the next United States
Senator from Kentucky
HEBE IS AXOTHEH BOlIOn
Hon I M Nance the Representa
tiveelect from Webster county was
elected as tfio nominee of the Repub
licans but j Judge Thos Nunn of
Hopkins county who was here yes
terday saya Mr Nance pledged him
self in his speeches and otherwise to
vote for Hon J O S Blackburn for
United States Senator Mr Nances
Democratic opponent had already
declared for McCreary and when
Mr Nance minounced that he would
vote for Blackburn a number of
Democrats rallied to his support and
elected him Tho question that now
resents itself is whether or not Mr
S ance will fulfill his ante election
pledge If Blackburn is the Demo
cratic caucus nominee and Nance
does keep his promise it means that
Blackburn yjill succeed himself in
the Senate grovided that none of the
Democratsolt his nomination
