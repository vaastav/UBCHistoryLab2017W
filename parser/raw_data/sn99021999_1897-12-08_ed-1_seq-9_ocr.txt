Hamlln Garland recalls thtt the tin ped
dler bos gone out of the west and that the
creamery man has taken his place to a
large extent , and upon this fact be has
framed a dellghtful character sketch ot true
western life. The story , "The Creamery
Man of Molasses Gap" is published in tnc
annual baok number ot The Outlook , and in
thl aame number , which conUinu n article
on "The Making of Books , " by Theodore Ie
Vlnne , and one on "Bookbinding cs a Fine
Art , " by Ernest D. North , there is a
thoughtful essay on "Modern Llterarj Ten
dencies , " in which necessarily tbe writings
of Garland and other wee-tern authors ar-
considered. Mr. Garland is of the school of
realism , but he calls It vcrltism , and on
IMs eubjeot The Outlook sajs :
"Mr. Garland often uses the word verl-
tlsra to describe the art method In which
which he conscientiously
ht dee-ply believes and
tiously pursues It Is a goad word so Ions
as It is not used polemically , tnd many oj
Mr. Garland's short stories admirably Illus
trate la ! meaning. In these stories Mr. Gar
land slrows a fixed resolution to get human ,
rather than purely lltenry Interest into his
portraitures ; to make the story significant
In the highest degree of human condition
and character ; wherever he bat done this ,
with a wise selection ot theme , he has
revealed Insight and skill of fc rt'nulne ortlei
and has given us first hand work. No one
has made us feel eo d-esply the crushing toll
of life on great farms or the solitude of
life In Isolated homes In tbe nor'hwestern
iwInter as he ; no one has expressed mom
adequately or sympathetically the fertllltj ,
the 'beauty , the spaciousness of the prairie
Such work shows the artistic quality ot the
man no loss 'than ' his sincerity. "
Albert Shaw , himself a. western man , notes
the fact In his American Monthly Review ol
Reviews that Mr. G&rland's "Rose or
Dutcber s Coolc-y" has been , one of the "ex
tremely bucce-bful bool.s of the present jcar
In London , where genuine American quali
ties have quite agreeably differentiate' * ! ' " .
from the caramon run of English noxelB
Mr Garland has been -devoting his time
the past two years to the preparation of a
ttudy of the career and character of General
Grant , buii be has found time to bring out
another volume of stories , the "WajslCe
Courtships. " Mr Shaw adds that "the
literary actlvltj of the west has been amaz
ingly Bllmulatod by the discovery , under tht
leadership of men like Jlr Garland , that
"the best possible place to find literary ma
terial Is at home "
Charles F. .Lummis IE one of itae eom-
paratlvely new western writers and he has
ottaincd fame quickly by branching out into
an entirely new field. His magazine work
has been largely descriptive ot the w ret nnd
southwest , and his splendid preparation foi
fiuch work through companionship with tht
western men familiarity with tac Indlan-
ar-d thorough study of every phase of we t
eru life fcas given him high standing in the
field of letters. He Is also at home In He-
lion , into which he weaves the folk tales und
legends of the Indians and the ancient rest
dents of Mexico jnd South America In
"The Enchanted iBurro" he has collected a
number of his stories of New Mexico and
South America. Tbe etory that gives tltlr

nona of these stories have the d'stlnctlj '

The trial of the cece of the city against
Iho bondsmen of Henrr Bo'.ln , ex-city trcaa
urer , started In yesterday with Jc-hn Rush ,
Itolln'B predecessor , on the witness stand en
cram-examination , the cltj atto.ney taking
up the examination at the point where It wcs
drc-pped Monday night at the adjournment ot
court.
On goingon the stand the witness pre
sented his schedules , ebon Ing a total if
$197,689.81 undlstribJtcd funds on head In
the city treasury at the time of the expha-
tbn of Bolln's first term of office. Asked If
It was proper to give Bolln credit for the
amount shown by the t > cheiJule , witness
thought the credit proper under certain con
ditions , as the dealt was the method cf
reaching a certain end , the end sought being
the distribution of finds en hand at the
time of Bolln turning the oflico 01 er to his
successor. The witness said that hr knew of
no cffurc being made to distribute the grand
total of funds referred to In bis scnedule.
Witness could net tell how much of the
money diown bj his schedule bslonged to
the cltj and bow much beloiiged to the Beard
of nducatlsn. cs no separation cf funds had
been made. Such tcpatnUcr ; would take
onth < < of time and would necessl te gcins
vcr the books and warrants Item bj Item
ccordlng to his shedule witness concluded
iat Btlln had paid warrants and obligations
ut cf the cash drawer and thct c yments
n bath city cad Board ot education cbilgu-
ons lad been so paid.
DEFENSE OBJECTS STRENUOUSLY.
City AU.Mi.ey Council asked the witness
f he considered proper to paj Board of Edu-
ation obligations out of the city cash
rawer ?
Attorney Mahoney , for the bondsmen , oh
ected to the question contending that this
svldence was not proper on cross-cxamlna-
lon.
lon.The
The city attorney retorted by saying that
ac defense had started w ith Mr Rush in the
lopes of constructing a rope of sand , and
bat row cs tto ropp had parted they -were
rposed to allow iDg him to testify ns to the
eal conditions as they -were found to exist
The court held that the question would be
material at another stage of the trial and
hen the cross-examination drifted off into
nether phase ot the case
In replj to a question Jjj Mr. Connell , the
\ itness said that he had not made a separate
chedule of city warrants paid out of the
ash drawer , He had no personal know-ledge
f how many such warrants , if any , had been
o raid There was no way of ascertaining
he aggregate without going through the
looks of the warrants and the warrants
hemselves. To make an accurate compu
tation of the amount would require the time
of two experts for from three to six months
and perhaps longer.
Taking up the schedule the witness was
asked if it was not true that his footings
Deluded items that belonged to the second
erm of Bolln's administration. Mr. Rush
said that such wss a fact but that he did
not put them there The figures , he said ,
were made by Expert Accountant Doollttlo
for the bondsmen. Wbe& w itness checked the
schedule he found the error
BOLLN WAS CARELESS
Mr. Rush testified that in going through
,1'e books of the treasurer's office he found
hat 'Bolln ' had been quite tareless in depos-
ting Board of Education funds in the city
depositories and city funds In Board of Ed
ucation depositories but could not say to
What extent this practice had hpfn carried
on.
on.Tho -witness found that the money held in
abejance related to liquor license monej
laid in for licenses that had not been
granted. That money did not belong to the
city and consequently w as not chargeable to
any fund , nor should it properly e cred-
itfti to any fund until alter the granting of
the liquor license which it cohered after
wiich it was money belonging to the Board
of Education
Mr. Connell asked If it was not a fact that
on the lest day of Bolln's first term there
was the sum of $38,000 In the city cash
drawer , held by the city treasurer to pay for
licenses that had not been granted and for
which amount Bolin had beea given credit'
Mr Mahoney objected to the question con
tending that it was conceded that a treas
urer had no right to take money that 'was
held in trust nnd convert it to any fund
either dtj or board of education. However
If the citj had advanced money to the Bean
of Education and at the end of the year i
was found that the.board had an excess o
receipts , the citj would have a right to take
out its money from this excess , which , in
other words , would constitute the assets on
hand
The objection -wa sbustainedand , Mr. Rush
was excused.
CHANGES IN BOLLN'S BOOKS
At this afternoon's session of court. Ban
ue1 Spratlen. balance clerk at the Natloaa
Bank cf Commerce , was called by the state
oa cross-examination. The- witness was
' aked If the sum of $10,000 had not bean
trarsferred from BolWs general account a

replied that during the last moaib of Bolln'
firM term the money had been trcnsferru

ked if it was not true- that another ban ]
pi-shook had been issued to Boln ! , covering
the ssjne months , in which erasures ar <
entases had been made. The vvltccss dli
not remember lie was then asked If It " a
not true that the figures put irto the oil
book had been transferred into the book la
evidence. The wltnrEs again said that b
did not rememutr.
At this point > Mr. Council presented th
old passbook referred to and askeJ Spratle
if it was a book of the hank. The witnes
thought it was , though be was not certain
Later on , however , he suld it was a boo
that ho had used in checking up Bolln's at
count as city treasurer. On the page of th
book showing the December account tbcr
are three changes in the figures as well a
B change in the footings. One Item show
that it was originally entered as $59,000 an <
was scratched and made to appear as $49.00
The footings were also changed to
eonvspand with the change in the psg
of the book. There was also an entry o
$23,000 , a pencil mark having been run
through it.
Asked wbo made the changes in the boo
witness said that they were made by him.
T o erasures had been mi.de below th
footings , but What words or figures hai
been erased witness could not say.

count with tbe city treasurer. Tbe transfe
to ( be specUl fund -was made on Januir

i\o ' 2nd give the Spaniards a cheoce , all
may jet be well , but the recent experience
does not make us ocr ar > 3t-inc. "
The Dally Chronicle Describes the message
as "weak and colorless compared with the
vigorous handling of ; .public questions to
which Mr. Cleveland accustomed us. " It
says the explanation of this is simple. "Mr.
Cleveland was la front'-of congress.-JiIr , Mc-
Kinlty IE behind it/ The president's com
ments on the currency Issue are positively
childlike in their simplicity. It is safe to
prophesy that tils treatment of the Cuban
luestioa yill be received -with o storm. The
annexation of Cuba would be a deplorable
mistake , but the reasens for refraining from
: hlt course are not the milk aud mater cues
Mr McKinlcy advanies. "
The Morning Pest , after pajing a tribute
to the president's fine sense of duty 4a the
domestic trouble , in sending the message a )
the appointed hour , s-js "The meseige
elaborates a schema at * legislative effort less
short-sighted and less calculated to set class
against class than tbe .misguided policy o
the last session. On the Cubsu quesHcn tbe
president is vague nd diffuse , but etudl-
ouslj correct Cuban matters , however , arc
unimportant as compared with Ihe grave
iesucs of domestic attain ; . The big battle
of the session will tic lought oa the grount
of borne politics and finances" The edl
torlal special ! ) praises "President McKlrJej's
treatment of the currency question.
The Times saje "Its tone of patronizing
tolerance will make the message not wboll ;
agrctable to Spain. Probably tbe president
calculates if he can catlsfy the jingoes for a
time wltb elegant denunciations , etc. , be
will find It easier to Jatroduce a moderate
policy In his currscgy problems It seems
the president cllzge to the notion that some
thing may be done for silver So long as be
follows that will-o'-the-wisp he can bardlj
be expected to attempt any thorough-goini
reform of the curcsncy/ '
Tbe Standard sajs : "Tbe best that can
be said of tbe message if that it Is abso
lutely vaexclting As a distinguished poll
tlclan tbe president labored under great dif
acuities , and it is co reproach to bis skll
tbat DP has failed to surmount them. I
Mr McKlnley represents anything so far
It U the new tariff , which is confessedly a
palpable failure. The whole currency plan

regard to Cuba the president has taken carte
to keep within tbe limits of Internationa
comity and good feeling. With reference t
his declaration ( hat ehould America be compelled

tbe necessity for such action will be
clear ae to command tbe support of tbe civ

tbe editorial asserts { hat Mr Cleveland'
RimlUr plan never fopnd favor with con

News eajs : "The message rings true am
promises a fair trial of Spain's new p'acs
more than which the pres'dctit ' could not b
expected to do. "
TLo St. James Gazette this afternoon , com

MJS ; " 11 has disappointed everybody in tb

Tte Pall Mall Gezotie takes a favorab
view of tbe presidential message and crlt
clses tbe comment of' tbe Times , remarl
ing that it is as impossible "to deal wll
tbe Cuban question without offending Spain

IICSV SCENE AT THE GEIOU\DS.

Wnrra Dnj a.
Swarms of workmen are again clinging to
the walls anl roofs of the big buildings on
the exposition grounds end ar ? endeavoring
to make up for the delay produced by tbe
storm of the latter part of last week The
good and warmer weather r-as permitted
appreciable progress to be made upon all
the structures.
The Nebraska building has reached its top
most point The highest dome on the struc
ture has been almost completed and jesterdaj
morning tbe flagstaff upon it was raised
in the air. Tbe building is now almost com
pletely roofed over. The squad of workmen
on tbe Bluff tract , upon which Nebraska's
building is Jocuted , bos resumed operations
on Uie water works system and is continuing
to set out the trees wltb which tbe area will
be adorns 3
In a short time another of the buildings
will have put on lit coat of white. Yesterday
morning Contractors Smith and Eastman set
their workmen at the task of 'putting staff
upon , the Machinery and Electricity building
The warm weather has also permitted Con-
tra'dor Bonet to almost complete the white
coat on the Administration arch. The work
men are putting on tbe finishing touches.
Hard luck is still standing in the way of
the IruiJding of the Fine Arts Palace. Work
on this structure has been delayed by the
oon-arrlval of lumber. Yesterdaj1 , how
ever , five carloads of lumber came In and It
was expected that the structure could be
started. When the material was examined ,
however it was found to consist of roof lum
ber. The delay is disappointing , but the con
tractor made the best out of the situation
by set'lns tols workmen to work getting thereof
roof timbers in proper form.
The Government building has comenced
to rise into existence , Tbe piling has been
put in and jesterday the first of tbe
big Umbers to support the outside walls
were erected. Appreciable progress le also
evident on the Auditorium , The first floor
of the building is in such condition that
work on the second etory framework le be
ing begun.
The roof on the Mining building is about
finUbed and tbe carpenters have commenced
work on tbe tower at the northwest corner.
Staffs for this superstructure have been put
in plsce. Tbe work ot trussing on the Agri
cultural building has also been completed.
Tbe Liberal Arts building Is also advanc
ing in good gape , _

Lorin Tliurrton , formerly minister of tbe

While the animal collection which has
beea recently Installed In Rlvervlcvv p rk
may not come into direct competition with
Hagenback for a couple ot je-ars , jet It
boasts of the smartest coon that has jet
been discovered. The meet remtrkkble evi
dence cf the sagacity of this particular coon
U found in a ptory for the truth ot which"
Councilman , Stuht and Park Commissioner
Cornish art- ready to furnish an. oClclal bond.
The animal Is a comparatlv elj recent acqui *
slt'on to the menagerie. It was billed as a
common , ordlwry , evcrj-da > coon , but slnco
them It has established a claim to a degree ol
intelligence ot which the co a family baa
not beea tmspe-cted. When Mr. Coon vv ae in
stalled as a permanent member of the River-
view park family there WOE a lack of ade
quate accommodations As a temporary ex
pedient bo was hitched to one end of a stout
chain while the other was ornanratcil with
a steel r sg which wta slipped over the top
of a stout elake. As the ptttKe was neiriy
ten feet high and firmly Itnledded Ia the.
ground It was believed that this was a suf
ficient precaution to Insure- his detention.
As it turned out Mr Coon had rot th& .
slightest inttntici ) of deserting. He know a.
snap when he found It and was perfectly con
tented to loaf in a suunj spot and eat every
thing whlcii the deeper and scores of ad
miring school children ihrew his way. But ,
beginning Immediatlj thercnficr , the-ro wer *
continual complaints fiom neighboring resi
dents that someone was taking liberties with
their hen roosts. Evtrj night some oae
missed a nice fat pullet end In saito of every
effort to discover the invader he remained ,
unsuspected. All this time the coon re
mained attached to bis stake and kept up an ,
appearance of general good conduct which
was beond reproach TSie first susplrlco at
tached to his coonshlp a few dajs ago when
the keeper discovered a few ctraj chicken ,
leataers stick-ing in hf ! > fur. But this was.
dismissed us a lank injustice to the coon ,
as his ring was still attached to tbe stako-
and the depopulated htn roosts "were blocks ,
bejcnd the reach of the cdaln. But the next
day the feathers were again in
evldcnco cud it began to be ap
parent that there was some Incom
prehensible connection between the coon
and the numerous trespasses. The keeper-
spent a couple of dajs in trjlng to figure
out how a coon that was chained to a stolio
in Riverview park could acquire pullets that ,
were roosting comfortably half n dozen
blocks away He hai to give It up , but de
cided to lose a nights sieep and watch .Mr.
Coon The latter individual slumbered ,
quietly until long after midnight , and tba
watcher thought he had had his vigil for
nothing ( But towards 2 o clock the animal
stretched himself and quietly 'bega ' to shin , ,
up the pole. When he got to the top he man
aged to wriggle the ring off the stake and
'was free. Ten minutes afterwards there-was.
-clearly audible cackling and confusion la
the direction of the nearest hen j ard , and ia
half an hour lr. Coon returasd , licking hla
chops and scattering feathers galore as bo
hustled bccl : to his old stand. Then .he-
shinned up the pole ! again , dropped the ring
over and slid back to hlb place. The keeper
avers that the animal actually winked at him
when he came around to feed him the next ,
morning , but anyhow the stake has been dis
carded and the coon is now a - In

The Board of Review is still vvorking-

the task is fairly well advanced. So far
nearly all of the complaints have been sat
isfactorily adjusted and the members believo-
that when the asseesmcnt is completed and
thoroughly underetood by the property own
ers It will be more generally satisfactory
than any of tbe assessments under the oil
sjstcm
While the revision of the work of the cs-
siors is in the main avery tedious and
uninteresting process , a rather humorous sit
uation is occasionally developed , which
bems to vary the monotony. Yesterday
tbe owner of a prominent down town cor
ner dropped into the outer office and regls-
ered a tremendous kick en tha valuatloa
vhlch had been placed < jn his property. ,
which he declared was ridiculously high.
The funny feature of the transaction was
be fact that at the exact mln-Jte nhen the
iroperty owner was making his protest
he board vvta busllj tuKCpcd in the next
