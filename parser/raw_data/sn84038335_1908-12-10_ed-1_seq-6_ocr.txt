Use the Power.
To Hceoioplisii hi. means of course a
certain Increase hi the of., not the
creation of -power, by th" central gov
ernment. The power already exists it
does not have to be created: the onlv
ltieH!ion is whether it shall be used or
left idle--»nd meanwhile 'he corporations
over which the power oughi to be exer
cised will not remain idle, l.et those who
object to this Increase in the use of the the dignity of
only power available, the national power, honored
be frank, and admit openly that thev pro
pose to abandon any effort to control the
great business corporations and to exer
cise supervision over the accumulation
and distribution of wealth for such su
pervision and control can only

:ne
through this particular kind of increase
of power. We no more believe in tha?
empiricism which demands absolutely un
restrained individualism than we do In
that empiricism which clamors for a
deadening socialism which would destroy
all Individual Initiative and would rulii
ihe country with a completeness that not
oven an unrestrained individualism itself
could achieve.
The danger to American democracy lies
not In the le:3.sr in the
administrative power In
accountable hands. It lies in having the
power Insufficiently concentrated, so that
no one can be held responsible to the
people for Its use. Concentrated power
Is palpable, visible, responsible, easllv
reached, Quickly held to account. Power
scattered through many administrators,
many legislators, many men who work
behind and through legislators and ad
mlnl«tru,tor«, tg Impalpable, ts unseen,
Irresponsible, can not oe reached, can not
be held to account. Democracy la

by stale action but. the national govern

i'iel far leaching fashion not only tor all
employes of ih« national government, but
for all persons o|]jj ed In Interstate

be achieved io a measurable degree, as
I'sir as those killed or crippled are con

been worn out. I call your attention to
the faei that definite steps toward pro

In many of our p-ivatc industries. These

THE COURTS.
I moM earnesuj urge upon the congress
the duty of Increasing the totally fnad
eipiate salaries now given to our judge's,
(in the whole, there is no body of public
servants who do as valuable work, nor
whose moneyed reward is so Inadequate
compared lo their work. Beginning with
the supreme court the judges should have
their salaries doubled. I: Is not bcUt.Mng
the ration that its most
public servants should be puld
sums so small compared to whas they
would earn in private life that the p.«r
lot-manec «.f public service by them
implies au exceedingly heavy p'-eunUry
sacrifice.
It is earnestly to be desired that some
method should be vie vised for doing away
witn the long' delays which now obtain
in t-he administration of Justice, and
which operate with peculiar
against persons of small
vor only the very criminals
most desirable to punish. These long
lays In the dual decisions of cases make
in the aggregate a crying evil and a
remedy should be devised. Much of this
intolerable delay is due to improper re-
onccntration of gard paid «o technicalities which are a
responsible and mere hindrance to justice. In some noted
recent cases this over regard for techni
calities has icsulted in a striking denial
of justice, and flagrant wrong to the
body politic.

.For many of the shortcomings of'jii?

are themselves to blame, and the judges
and juries merely bear tii^lr sharetogrrher
with the public as a whole, it Is discred

bringing in justice men who as public
servants have been guilty of corruption,
or who have prof)red by tiie corruption of

fortunate, whether ie to hairsplitting

by judires. to sentimentality and class
consciousness on rhc par: of juries, or
'o hysteria arrd sensationalism in tie

manifold and conflicting' Interpretations
of the interstate commerce law. Control

is supplied by tin- "inip'oyenieut" of ihe

Such shot sighted, vacillating, ami fu

The remedy ile.s in abandoning the meth

adopting new ones in keeping with the
needs and demands of one people,
I 'mil the work of river improvement is
undertaken Ir. a modern wav ft can nor
have results that will meet, the needs of
this modern nation. These needs should
be met without further dilly-dallying or
delay. The plan which promises the best
and quickest results is that of a perma
nent commission authorized to co-ordinate
the work of all government d"partments
relating to the waterways, and to frame
aiid supervise the cxecuiitm of. a compre
hensive plan. Tnder such a commission
the actual work of construction might be
entrusted to the reclamation service* or
to Hie miliary onglneers acting with a suf
ficient number of civilians to continue the
work In time of war or it might be di
vided between the reclamation service
and the corps of engineers. Funds should
be provided from current revenues If It
Is deemed wise- otherwise from the sale
of I Hinds. The essentia thing is that the
work should go forward 1.rider the best
possible plan, and with the least posible
delay. We should have a new type of
work and anew organization for planning
and directing It. The time for plavlng with
our waterways is past. The country ue
mands results.
National Parks.
I urge that all our national parks ad
jacent to national lorests be placed com
pletely under the control of the forest ser
vice of the agricultural department in
stead of leaving them as they now'are.
under the interior department and policed
by the army. The congress should provide
for superintendents with adequate corps
of lirst class civilian scouts, or rangers,
and further, place the road construction
under the superintendent Instead of leav
ing it with file war department. Such a
change in park management would result
iu economy and avoid the difficulties of
administration winch now arise from hav
ing the responsibility of care and protec
tion divided between different depart
ments. The need of this purpose is pecul
iarly great in Vellowstone park. This
like the Voseniite. is a great wonderland'
and should be kept as a national play
ground. Jn both all wild things should he
protected, and the scenery kept wholly
unmarred.
1 am luippv to say that have been able
to set aside iu various parts of the conn
try. small, well chosen tracts of ground
to serve as sanctuaries and nurseries for
wild creatines.
DEPARTMENT MATTERS.
It lias been my purpose from the beein
ntnB of my ftdminl.siruiloii to lake the
Indian service completely out of the at
mosphere of political activity, and there
has been steady progress toward that end
The last remaining stronghold of politics
in that service was the aRency system,
which had s«en its best days and was
gradually falling to pieces from natural
or purely evolutionary causes, but like
all such survivals, was decaying slowly
in Its later stages. Jt seems clcar that lt«
extinction had better be made final now,
1 so that the ground can bo cleared for
larger constructive work on behalf of
the Indians, preparatory to their induc
tion into the fill) measure of responsible
citizenship, un November 1 only IS agen
cies were left on the roster With two
exceptions, where some legal questions
seemed to stund temporarily in the way.
these have been changed to superlntend
eneies. and ihc-r hrads brought into the
elassihcd civil service.

men of mediocre capacity who have but a
short time to serve. No man should re
pard it as his vested right to rise to th*
highest rank in the army any more than
iu any other profession. It is a curious
and by no means creditable fact that there
should be so often a failure on the part of
the public and its representatives to under*
stand the great need, from the standpoint
of the service and tho nation, of refusing
to promote respectable, elderly Incompe
tents. Tho higher places should be given
to the most deserving men without re
gard to seniority at least seniority should
oe treated as only one consideration. In
the stress of modern Industrial compe
tition no business Arm could succeed If
those responsible for its management
were chosen simply on the ground that
they were iho oldest people ill its employ
ment: yet tills is the course advocated as
regards the army, and required by law
for all grades except those of general of

officers in the highest ranks of the army
are those 1haveattained their present

he cavalry arm should be reorganized
upon modern lines. This is an arm in
which it is peculiarly necessary that the
held officers should not be old. The cav
alry is much more difficult to form than
inioniry, and it should he kept up to the
maximum both in efficiency and in
strength, for it cannot be made in a
hurry. Ai present botli Infantry and ar
tillery are too few in number for our
needs, iOspecial intention should be paid
tv development of the machine gun. 'A
general service corps should be estab
lished. As things are now, the average
soldier has far too much labor of a non
military character to perform.
National Guard.
Now that the organized militia, the Na
tional C.uard, has been incorporated with
the army as a part of the national forces,
it behooves the government to do every
reasonable thing in Its power to perfect
its efficiency, it should be assisted in Its
instruction and otherwise aided more lib
erally than heretofore. The continuous
services of many well trained regular
officers will be essential In this connec
tion. Such officers must be specially
trained at service schools best to qualify
them as Instructors of the National
tiuard. But the detailing of officers for
training at the acrvice schools and for
duty with the National r»uard entails de
taching them from their regiments, which
are already greatly depleted by detach
ment of officers for assignment to duties
prescribed by acts of the congress.
A bill is now pending before, the con
gress creating number of extra officers
in the army, which if passed, as it ought
to he, will enable more officers to be
trained as instructors of National Guard
and assigned to thar. duty. In case of
war It will be of the utmost importance
to have a large number of trained officer#
to use for turning raw levies into good
There should be legislation to provide
a complete pian for organizing the great
body of volunteers behind the regular
army and national guard when war has
corne. Congressional assistance should be
given those who are endeavoring to pro
mote rifle practice «.» that our men, tn
the services or out of them, may know
how to use the rifle. While teams repre
senting the. Pnltod States won tho rifle
and revolver championships of the world
against all comers In Kngland this year,
it Is unfortunately true that the great
body of our citizens shoot less and less
as dine goes on. To meet this, we should
encourage rifle practice among school
boys, and Indeed, among all classes, as
well as in the military services, by every
means in our power. Thus, aiid not
otherwise, may we be able to assist In
preserving the peace of the world. Fit to
hold our own against the strong nations
of the earth, our voice for peace will
carry to the ends of the ear in. Unpre
pared, and therefore unfit, we must alt
d.umb and helpless fo defend ourselves,
protect others, or preserve peace. The
first step—In tne direction of preparation
to avert war if possible, and to be flt for
war If It should come—Is to teach our
men how to shoot.

approve the recommendations of the
general board for the Increase of the navy,
calling especial attention to the need of
additional destroyers and colliers, and
above all. of the four battleships. It Is
desirable to complete as soon as possible
a squadron of eight battleships of tho best
existing type. The North Dakota. Dela
ware. Florida and i:tab will form the first
divison of this squadron. The four ves
sels proposed will form the second divi
sion. It will be an Improvement on the
first, the ships being of the heavy, single
caliber, all big gun type. All the vessels
should have the same laciical qualities,
that is, speed and turning circle, and as
near as possible these tactical qualities
should be the same as is in the four ves-'
sels before named now being built.
I I most earnestly recommend that the
general board be by law turned Into a gen
eral staff. There is literally no excuse
whatever for continuing the present bu
reau organization of the navy. The navy
should be treated as a purely military or
ganlzation, and everything should be sub
ordlnated to the one object of securing
military efficiency. Such military effi
ciency can only be guaranteed In time of
war If there is the most thorough previous
preparation in time of peace—a prepara
tion, 1 may add, which will iu all proba
bility prevent any need of war. The sec
retary must be supreme, ami ho should
have as his official advisors a body of line
officers who should themselves have the
power to pass upon and coordinate all the
work and all the proposals of the several
bureaus. A system of promovion by mer
it, either by selection or by exclusion, or
by both processes, should be introduced,
ft is out of the question, if the present!
principle of promotion by mere seniority Is
kept, to expect to get the best results from
the higher officers. Our men come too
old. and stay for too short a time, In the
high command positions.
Two hospital ship*, should be provided.
The actual experience of the hospital ship
with the flee' In the Pacific has shown the
Invaluable work which such a ship does,
and has also proved (hat it Is well to have
It kept under the command of a medical
officer. As was to he expected, all of the
anticipations of I rouble from such a com
mand have proved completely baseless.
It is as absurd to pur a hospital ship under
a line officer as it would be to put a hos
pital on shore under such command.
This ought to have been realized before,
and there ir* no excuse for failure to real
ize 11 now.
Nothing better for the navy from every
standpoint has ever occurred than the
cruise of the battle fleet around the world.
The improvement of the ships in every
way has been extraordinary, and they
have gained far more experience in battle
tactics than they would havo gained if
they had stayed in the Atlantic waters
The American people have cause for pro
found gratification, both In view of the
excellent condition of the fleet as shown
by this cruise, and in view of the improve
ment the cruise has worked in this al
ready high condl I Ion. 1 do not believe that
there Is any other service In the world
In which the average of character and
efficiency in the enlisted men Is as high as
is now the case In our own. I believe that
the same statement can hr made as to our
officers, taken as a whole but there must
be reservation made in regard to those In
the highest ranks—as to which I have al
ready spoken—and In regard to those who
have just entered the service: because we
do not now gel full benefit from our ex
cellent naval school at Annapolis. It Is
absurd not to graduate the midshipmen as
ensigns: lo keep litem for two years in
such an anomalous position as at present
the law requires is detrimental to them
