THE PKESIDEN I’S MESSAGE
The notable defect of President
Taft’s message to Congress yester
day is its failure to say anything
about three subjects on which the
country wanted to hear from him
namely, the proposed modifications
of the Interstate Commerce act, the
Sherman Antitrust law and the con
servation of natural resources, says
the “Baltfmore Sun.” These he will
discuss later, but there seems no
good reason why he should not have
dealt with at least two of them now
and omitted some of the tedious
and routine details with which he
encumbers the message. Roosevelt’s
messages were long, but they were
generally sensational enough to be
interesting. Mr. Taft’s is long and
dull-an insufferable combination.
Let us hope that in the future, while
avoiding Roosevelt's Wild West
melodrama, he will also avoid his
prolixity.
The President makes it clear in
his message that he opposes further
tariff revision by the Sixty-first
Congress. It is a fair inference
from his statements that he does not
believe, in the light of the informa
tion he now has that there is any
need for the revision of the Aldrich-
Payne act. It may be possible, how
ever, for the tariff reformers of his
party to extract a crumb of comfort
from the President’s declarations
regarding the work -of the experts
appointed by him to assist in the
administration of the maximum and
minimum clause of the tariff law.
“If,” promises Mr. Taft,
secured by the tariff board show
generally that the rates of duties im
posed by the present tariff act are
excessive, under the principles of
protection as described in the plat
form of the successful party at the
election, I shall not hesitate to in
vite tbe attention of Congress to
this fact and to the necessity for
action predicated thereon.’ This
board is not expected to conclude
its work, however, for “perhaps two
or three years,” the President ex
plains, so Mr. Taft’s administration
will be drawing to its close before
be will be able to present the con
clusions of his tariff experts to Con
gress. It may be that this delay
will not be approved by the “insur
gent Republicans” of the West who
resented Mr. Taft’s characterization
of the Aldrich Payne act as the best
tariff law ever passed by a Republi
can Congress.
Several months ago the country
was shocked by revelations of fraud
ulent practices in weighing sugar by
which the Government was cheated
of revenue. Tbe Sugar Trust, the
beneficiary of these frauds, was com
pelled to make restitution in part.
To the suggestion that there should
be an investigation by Congress of
these frauds and of tbe operations
generally of the Sugar Trust, the
President interposes an objection.
The Treasury Department and
the Department of Justice,
he states, are probing these
fraudulent practices. They might
be embarrassed in their efforts to
convict guilty persons, as an inves
tigation by-Congress would possibly
result in giving immunity to men
whom the government intends to
prosecute. It would be contrary to
sound public policy if any of the men
implicated in the scandalous frauds
upon the Government should escape
punishment which they richly de
serve. Mr. Taft’s objection to an
immediate investigation by Congress,
therefore, would be a valid and con
vincing one if a Congressional inves
tigation involved necessarily “mi
munity baths” for alleged lawbreak
ers in return for the information they
might give to a committee of Con
gress. The cooperation by Con
gress, the Department of Justice
and the Treasury Department, how
ever, could easily be arranged upon
a basis ou which there would be no
promise of immunity to any wit
nesses at a Congressional inquiry.
In this way important practical re
sults might be accomplished without
concessions to lawbreakers.
Tbe President approves tbe plans
for reorgan zation of tbe army and
navy, which have been presented in
detail in “The Sun’s” Washington dis
patches. Economy is Mr. Taft’s
watchword as regards both the army
and navy. The army estimates and
tbe naval estimates have been great
ly reduced by bis direction—the ag
gregate ieduction being $83,0(10,000.
The ordinary Government expendi
tures ol the cunert fiscal year will
exceed Uie estimated receipts by
$34 000,000. Ji to this dificit there
be added lbs disbursements for the
Panama Canal, $33,000,000, and ■
$1,000,000 for other purposes, ihe'
total deficit on June 30, 1910, will
be $73,000,600. Therefore, Mr. Tall j
is insisting upon economy, and bis 1
attitude on that subject is prac ita
and commendable.
Turning from domestic to foreign
relations it is important to note that
President Taft finds Japan, in recant
treaties with China, has not violated
the principle of the “open door” or
THE PRINCE GEORGE’S ENQUIRER-UPPER MARLBOROUGH. MARYLAND, DECEMBER 10,1909
adopted a course detrimental to
American interests.
In discussing tbe situation in |
Nicaragua Mr. Taft falls into line
with the Kjoosevelt policy of the
“big policeman” for the turbulent
little states, of Central America.
“Neither the Monroe doctrine nor
an}’ other doitiine of American pol
icy,” the President declares, “should
be permitted,to operate for the per
petuation of* irresponsible govern
ment and thq escape of just obliga
tions. He adds, however, in respect
to the killing of Americans by Nic
araguan soldiers, that “this Govern
ment is proceeding with deliberate
circumspection to determine tbe ex
act truth and the course in the prem
ises most consistent with its dignity.,
its duty to American interests and
its moral obligation to Central
America and civil organization.”
That is well said. Mr, Taft does
not use the strong language of the
Big Stick, although he will iikely.be
as firm as his predecessor in protect
ing American interests in every
quarter of the globe.
OUB WASHINGTON LETTER
Washington, D. C., December 4, 1900
Mr. Editor:
The few days preceding the meeting
of Congress in Washington are not
without interest. The President is im
mersed in his message to Congress
which, it is said, inasmuch, as it will
contain not more than fifteen thousand
words. This, however, will be of suf
ficient length and most readers will pre
fer to confine themselves to such
epitomes as the press always furnishes.
The Cabinet members are busy with
their several reports and come of them
have been completed. They are gen
erally asking smaller appropriations
than were demanded last year.
Economy is the watchword of the pre
sent administration but it is not at all
improbable that before the budget is
made up it will exceed more than the
billion dollar mark as did the last ap
propriation. It is difficult with t*he
ambitious schemes of public improve
ment and betterment in almost every
direction to see how appropriations can
be kept down.
There are many public plans and en
terprises for improvement of the public
service but none of them are startlingly
new although they are all increasingly
urgent. The Secretary of the Navy
has issued orders for the reorganization
of the Navy Department and are looked
upon by those whom it will affect as
nothing short of revolutionary. If he
is successful in carrying out his plans
much good will be accomplished. The
keynote to the changes in the Naval
establishment has been expressed in the
not novel truism that the object of the
Navy is to maintain an effective war
fleei on the seas. There is, probably,
not a school boy but knows that this
is a selfevident proposition and not a
Senator who would maintain that there
could be any other legitimate object
for the Navy and, yet, there are Sena
tors and members, admirals, com
modores, captains and lieutenants of
the Navy with their wives, mothers-in
law, sisters, cousins and aunts who
have for seventy-five or hundred years
lived, moved and had their being on the
hypothesis that Tjie object of the Navy
waste maintain, first, a splendid Navy
Department at Washington with dis
tinguished Naval officers at the heads
of various bureaus and other Naval
officers at a dozen Naval stations and
Navy lards that are no longer used
but are kept up at an immense expense
and that cannot be used for any legiti
mate Naval purpose because the en
trance to these Navy Yards is too
shallow for tbe admission of modern
warships. Their idea of the Navy is
that it was created and is maintained,
not for National defence but for tbe
benefit of a brillant corps of Naval
officers and their families and 'friends.
These Naval officers have intermarried
into the families of senators and cabinet
ministers, until they form the highest
social aristocracy in this country. They
are sore hit by this order of Secretary
Meyer. Senator Hale of Maine, who
has the sobriquet of the “Lord of the
Navy,” will, doubtless, be heard from
in opposition and other senators and
members will, doubtless, speak in
eulogy of the old Navy and the old
system and tell how much was accom
plished at Manila Bay and Santiago.
It may be excusable to “point with
pride,” but naval experts and close
students of naval progress know that
many improvements in naval construc
tion, naval equipments and naval
practice have been made since
the Spanish War and that if the
American navy is equal in strength,
man for man and ship for ship, with
the foremost navies of the world it is
because it has made a great progress
and improvement since it sank the
leaking lobster pot navies of Spain in
Manila Bay and at Santiago.
The Postmaster-Geneial is contem
plating improvements in tbe Postal
establishment, nothing new hut several
things urgent that have been long ad
vocated and that would have been car
ried in’o effect in a more effective and
less unwieldy Government than our
own. All reforms and governmental
betterments here have to wait on leg
islation; legislation has to wail on a
Congress that has been elected thirteen
months before it meats, a Congress
that knows more about District, county
or parochial affairs than about National
affairs, Congress composed of hundreds
of men who by time they learn their
business as National legislators have
lost their places or rather have their
places filled by men as green and un
tried as they themselves were when
first sent to Washington. In other
words, the legislative management of
the United States is not in the hands
of seniors but of freshmen who are
responsible not so much to the Nation
as to the provincial homes from they
which they come.
