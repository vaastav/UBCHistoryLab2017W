THE IRISH FREE STATE.
Ml: full text : t the agreement signed by tne
urn sn an.i insii represeniauve:; uin.iMioi.um
( : plete assurance of Hie stable, enduring foundation of
concession, compromise and good will upon winch
the Irish Free State cm come into being.
VVitli the same constitutional status as Canada,
Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the Irish
Free State is to be part of the community of na
tions known as the British Empire. It will have its
own Parliament, make its own laws, establish its
Own tariff system. Its obligations toward the British
Government in peace or war will be only such as
arc recognized in a fair and voluntary contract.
The Ulster difliculty is avoided by establishing the
Irish Free State first and leaving it to Ulster to de
cide whether she will remain a part of it
As for the much discussed oath of allegiance,
members of the Irish Parliament will swear al
legiance to the fYdKlitiitirin of the Irish Free State
and to Ik "faithful to His Majesty King George .v.
and his heirs and successors by law, in virtue of the
common citizenship of Ireland with G.vat Britain
and her adherence to and membership of the group
of nations forming the British Commonwealth of
Nations."
In other words, a member of the 'Irish Parliament
will pledge his allegiance to the Irish Constitution
and his faith to the British King the latter only in
virtue of and because of the former. Tims easily
is' an "insurmountable obstacle" surmounted.
The admirable spirit in which the agreement was
fV. finally reached is in no way better shown than in
?. the Irish attitude toward one of the biggest British
concessions the right of the Irish Free State to fix
its own tariffs.
The Dail Uireann delegates are reported to have
v. riven assurances that the Irish Free Stale would be
't certain of its own volition to declare for free trade
between Ireland and England.
The most discordant note so far has been sounded
characteristically enough by Lord Carson, the
former Ulster, leader.
1t is unbelievable, however, that anything will
prevent the Dail Eireann and the British Parliament
'from ratifying the agreement.
. The win of a majority of the people on botli sides
:of the Irish Sea to say nothing of the opinion of
the world should prove a compelling force.
', The longed-for moment has come. A free Irc-
iland is assured.
THE CANADA ELECTIONS.
. . J ESTERDAY'S elections in Canada turned nri-
hl marilv on the tariff, issue.
Canadian Conservatives have in general supported
the same theories of economic philosophy which
have been identified with Republicanism this side of
the line. The Canadian Liberals arc in general
vagreemenl with the tariff principles advocated by
-the Democrats in the United Slates.
Yesterday the Conservatives and the high pro
tection policy in Canada went down to defeat. The
Liberals and tariff reform won a decisive victory.
Yesterday was a big day for tariff reform. A
Republican President of the United States indorsed
a "flexible," tariff which is the convenient way out
. for the "die-hards" in Republican ranks.
.Gradually the world is learning its lesson. Ob
struction of trade is economically unsound. Politi
cally it fosters ill will and international suspicion.
Canada is to be congratulated on learning this lesson
-more readily than we of the United States have been
tble to acquire it.

KV A rnillTTAl nf IVicVMrvill mannovre nr.,
rested for violation of the Sunday laws
emphasizes the fact that basketball is a game that
commands widespread interest.
It is becoming popular as a winter sport in flie
same way that baseball and football have won
favor in summer and autumn.
The secret lies in the development of the game
itself.
A generation ago basketball was a game for
young ladies in bloomers, and it was as ladylike
as could be desired. It provided mild exercise and
little excitement.
When high school boys took up the game, rules
were relaxed so that it afforded considerable athletic
competition, but not much of a man-to-man test.
University, athletic club, semi-professional and
professional teams have further relaxed the rules
against roughness and the display of strength as
well as skill. Basketball is now a he-man's game,
- and as such it is winning public favor.
GIVE IT A NEW LEASE.
AGAIN Organized Labor has good cause to be
thankful to Samuel Untermyer and the
Jjockwood, investigators.
Ji. a nasty iscandal - that .has, been .uncovered in
the electrical union. Every member should be
thankful that it has been exposed. Laxity of book
keeping, prima-facie evidence of graft and a wrong
ful development of the permit system arc matters
that immediately concern every worker in the or
ganization. For the public at large it is more significant thai
Mr. Untermyer believes he could uncover a milk
trust if he had the power. If the people have any
thing to say about the matter, the Lockwood Com
mittee will get renewed and extended power to
make this investigation and perhaps follow up with
revelations of 'buses in other lines of lood supply.
The 'Lockwood Committee is not an expensive
luxury. Thus far it has forced payment of lines
in excess of its own expenses, not to-mention the
vastly greater savings resulting from its exposures.
Give it a new lease of life and extended powers.
It is effective and New York needs the help it
extends.

HINTS TO TRANSLATORS.
TTY COMPL1MENTS but yu'vc sot t d
a darned sight better than you've done to
date or let me do the doing."
Stripped of much polite phrase, President Har
ding's message to this overwhelmingly Republican
Congress boils down to that.
Between the lines and in some of them can
be read a Presidential warning that certain old Re
publican shibboleths must go into prompt retire
ment if the country is to have any confidence in
the present Congress when elections come round
next November.
Think of a Republican President suggesting,
even with apologies, that a Republican Congress
had maylv better quit monkeying with the tariff
and give the Chief Executive power, with-the help
of the Tariff Commission, to "proclaim duties" to
meet special conditions!
Think of his adding the reminder:
"That wo must not be unmindful ol world
conditions, that peoples arc struggling for In
dustrial rehabilitation and that wc cannot
dwell In industrial and commercial exclusion
and At the same tlino do the Just thing In aid
' lug world reconstruction and readjustment."
President Harding takes care not to be loo rough
with the American valuation plan, but he points to
"the danger of such a valuation, brought down to
the level of our own production costs, making our
tariffs prohibitive." Here again he1 delicately sug
gests to Congress the advisability of authorizing
"proclaimed American valuation" in Hie interest of
flexibility.
With similar tact the President points out how
much better it will be if Congress not only leaves
the funding of the foreign debt to the Treasury
Department where it belongs but also keeps its
hands off the question of terminating. commercial
treaties under the existing shipping law until the
executive branch of the Government presents a
plan.
Later on, when Congress has thought over these
things it ought not to do, President Harding prom
ises to tell, it more about one of the chief things
it can and must do improve on a muddle of a
tax law with which the President is known to be
as little satisfied as anybody else.
With the exception of this promise, a plea for
starving Russia and the suggestion of an industrial
court which deserves to be discussed by itself, the
President's message resolves itself in the main into
a sugar-coated hint that Congress might do less
harm if it left everything possible to him.
Only a little over a year ago Mr. Harding was
earnestly assuring the country:
"I would not want to bo your President
unless you are going to give us a Republican
Coneross to translate Republican promises
Into legislative enactment."
The country gave him the translators.
Now the President is fearful of consequences
unless they let him do the translating.
What was it they called Woodrow Wilson?

To Ibe 1'dltor cf The Kienlne World:
Your remarks as to tho apparent
tisclcssncss of trying to expedite foot
passenger trafilc by insisting on peo
ple keeping to tho right fits In well
with my own thoughts. l"or some
tlmo I have intended writing on the
same subject. My own travelling
takes mo over the "V and Hudson
Tube, and as a comparatively new
resident I have often wondered what
tho elevated uromotcrs were thinking
of when tliey arranged stairways as
at warren Sttcct, so ujiit. people
coming and going use the same
stairs. The conditions are vllo In tho
cxlremo and often lesult In people
losing a train. To think of four-foot
stairways under such conditions Is
farcical. Ah for tho HudHon sub-
way, conditions are more or less tho
same. Tho stairways aro wider and
In some Instances divided; but of
what use aro thw if people coming
uiid going lmpcdo each other?
The corridor leading to the ISric
depot (tho latter surely tho limit as
a terminal) is as bad or worse, it is
divided bv a rooe. tho widest space
being given to the ru&li hours crowd.
Hut granting tho widest spaco is so
arranged, the speed of tho crowd Is
governed by tnoso wno. inrough in
ability or because they havo amplo
time, saunter, oiten two or tnreo
abreast, without keeping as near to
the right as nosslble.
Hprcad out over the entire wiatn ot
tho corridor, thebe slow movers block
tho way of those who are fHSt walk
ers: stnnc even want to run. As a
result lots ot people lose their trains
simply bccauBO unthinking or selfish
Idiots will not givo a clear runway
on tho left. It pcoplo us they pass
slower moverB would switch over to
tho right they would leave room for
those who must go raster sun.
Isots of tcoplo having little time
tako tho roped-off section meant
for those bound in tho other dlrec
tlon. This Is bad enough, but some
of these, although moving faster
than others, forget mat some aro
anxious to go still faster, and as a
result lmnedo this runway also, it
seems to mo that half the people
using tho trains lack all knowledge
of right of way; a campaign to teach
thorn IB badly neeuea, ana tuose wno
will not tuko heed should be punished
bv nomo one n authority.
To assume that this sheep-like
wandering Is duo to continental train
ing is scaieelv correct. I believe In
England only is the rulo of the road
to tho left, and that applies to ve
hicles only. Foot passengers always
walk to tho r gilt: really a iirenostiT
nut rule, as it brings people on the
curb side, with trafilc coming behind
them.
,s to London's subways, all save
the older District and Metropolitan
ar controlled ly elevators. Thoso
entering .cannot com Into collision;
with thoso leaving. The latt' r must
take tho direction shown by tiu signs,
or they will never get out. The Dis
trict railways have scparato stalr
wuys, and any attempt to mount tho
hiuiih used by those descending will
bo stopped.
Iondon may bo sleepy In some
things, but when It comes to handling
city railway passenger!.. New York Is
a long way behind. Indeed, it would
appear that efforts are inado to im
pede trafilc. The platforms aro full
of pillars to block the way and ate
rarely of sufficient width. Did tho
builders forgot tha't New York was
growing? T. A. WESTON.

UNCOMMON SENSE
By John Blake
(Copjiljkt, U!l. bj 3ohn Ililke )
MAKE IT UNANIMOUS.
One of your troubles is thut you do not agree with your-
ind
You want to own u house and have an automobile
belong to a club and have money in the savings bunk.
These are all laudable ambitions. Getting rieli is not
anything against you unless you steal the money.
, On the other hand, you want to loaf more than is ood
for you, to spend more money than you can afford on trifles,
to waste your evenings with companions who are agreeable
but unprofitable.
You ccn never do all these things at once.
You have got to make a decision as to your policy and
follow it.
You arc a cort of a board of directors whose agreement
or disagreement will determine your future.
Boards of directors do not get along unless they are
practically unanimous.
They can talk it over and argue about the merits of
this or that plan. Jliijycvcntuull.v they have got to decide on
what the plan is to be and put it into execution.
If you really want that house and the automobile and
the club membership you must begin to plan to gel them
right now. The plan must eliminate the foolish extravagances,
the idleness and the wasted hours.
It must not eliminate a part of them. It must eliminate
all of them.
fall your board of directors together and think the thing
out. Muke all the arguments, for and against.
Then come to a unanimous agreement.
If you which is to say all the elements in you are
firm in your determination to be moderately prosperous, you
can be.
Hut there must be no minority hanging back and giy
iug trouble. ,
Every member of the board must be for the hard work
and the economy and the determination to make prosperity
the one thing toward which everything shall be centred. '
A unanimous man will get along. A divided man won't.
He solidly for your plan, whatever it is, and you will
find that you will be able to follow it bar accidents.
Be dividt d and uncertain and you will get neither t ie
enjoyment out of the loafing and tile agreeable companions
shortlived as that may be or the satisfaction of having
done something worth while with your life.
XI. SETTING OTHERS
STRAIGHT.
The commonest kind ot futile en
dcavor has always been to sot up for
our Lord a kingdom Jn this world
where Ho has expressly declared that
His kingdom is not and cannot be:
or In other words, to etlcct and main
tain that union of His church with
the state, which Ho expressly and In
most emphatic languago proclaimed
could never exist.
The constant disposition of many
who sincerely bellevo lu tho Master,
and really .want to follow Htm. to es
tablish for Him a ktngdom dn this
world, grows, moro c: less uncon
sciously, out of a senr of woaknoas.
They read In His Wora that wo shall
bo held responslblo at tho Judgment
bar, not for our acUons alone, but
for our very thoughts, before a Judge
"unto whom all hearts aro open, all
doslres known, and from whom no
socrcts aro hid."
Amid tho temptations of activo llfu
it Is difficult enough to bo decent in
action. Respectability Is hard to
maintain, with avarice and ambition
and lust and laziness forever drag
ging our hearts toward tho pit. And
so tho impulse to llnd sunns way of
getting around this closo-tcstlng
proclamation ot His is natural
enough. It Christ js going to eharso
up all our wicked thoughts against
us, and if it really Is quite too ticrlous
an undertaking to keop our minds
and hearts always clean and pure,
may It not happen that He will s.et
oft against our delinquencies iii this
respect the good works that .wc do'.'
If 1 have lusted after a woman,
may I not plead In extenuation that
I never work on Sunday? If 1 wish
that my competing neighbor might
bo ruined in hla business, may I not
atono for It by fasting on Uood Fri
day? J3ut even easier and therefore
raoro tempting than this n-liomo for
''getting even" on tho Internal Booka
la tho idea of atoning for not only our
thoughts but our wicked actions by
preventing wicltcdncsu in other
people.
If peoplo aro prono to attempt to
"nmko up" for vllo thoughts and au

how incorrigible is tho propensity t..
try tho same experiment by forcln?
what they consider good deeds upon
others! Smith reasons to himself--deliberately
or not la no matter, sine
ho acts upon tho rco3oulns aoirii

"Oh, I cannot think straight my

for any length of tlmo without takluh
