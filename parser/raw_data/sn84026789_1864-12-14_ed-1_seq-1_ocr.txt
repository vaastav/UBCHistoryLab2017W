Darkest of all Decembers
Ever my life has known,
Sitting here by the embers,
Stunned nutl helpless, alone ?
Dreaming of Two Graves, lying
Out in the damp and chill;
One where the buzzard, flying,
Pauses at Malvern Hill:
The other ? alas ! the pillows
Of that uneasy bed
?Rise and fall with the billows
Over Clarence's head.
Theirs 's the heroic story ?
Died by frigate and town!
Theirs the Peace and the Glory,
Theirs the Cross and the Crown.
Mine to linger and languish
Here by the wintry sea ?
. All, weak heart! in thy anguish
What is there left to tlice?
Only the sea intoning,
Only the wain-scot mouse.
Only the wild wind moaning
Over the lonely house.
Vet it was for Their Country,
Nobly they fought and died;
. If they have helped to save her,
Heart! be thou satisfied.

The President's Message.
t\ fl"IC Cifivus nf the (hul JIohm
oj Hcjtnsnt la fi ncs :
Again the blessings of health a nil
abundant harvests claim our profound
est gratitude to Almighty (iod.
The proposed overland telegraph be
tween America an<t Europe, by the way
of Uclirlng's Straits and Asiaiio llu.via.
which was sanctioned by Congress t
the lust session, has be< n undertaken
under very favorable circumstances by
an association of American citizens with
I , the cordial good will and : u j? port, as
j well of this Government as of those of
| Great Britain and ilus>ia. Assurances
j have been received from most of the
South American States, of their high
I appreciation ef the enterprise and their
readiness to co-operate in constructing
lines tributary to that world encircling
communication. I learn, with much
I satisfaction, that the noble design of a
telegraphic communication between the
Eastern coast of America auil Circa t
Britain has been renewed with full ex
pectation of its early accomplishment. ?
j Thus it is hoped, that with the return
j of domestic peace, the country will be
able to resume with energy and advan
tage. her former high career of couitticiec
and civilization.
The public debt on the first day of
July last, as appears by the books of the
Treasury, amounted to one billion seven
hundred and forty million six hundred
and ninety thousand four hundred and
eighty-nine dollars and forty-nine cents.
Probably should the war continue for
another year that amount may be in
creased by not far fiom live hundred
millions. Odd as it is for the most part
by our own people, it has become a sub
stantial branch of national though pri
vate property. For obvious reasons the
more nearly this property can be distri
buted among all the people the better.
To favor such general distribution great
er inducements to become owners might,
perhaps, with good effect, and without
injury, be presented to'persons of limit
cd means. With this view I suggest
whether it might not be both expedient
! and competent for Congress to provide
that a limited amount of some future is
sue of the public securities might be
held by auy bona fulc purchaser exempt
from taxatiou, and from seizure for
debt, under such restrictions and limita
tion as might be necessary to guard
against abuse of so -important a privi
lege. This would enable . prudent per
jsous to set asido a small anuuity
j against a possible day .of want.
J Privileges like these would render the
'possession of such securities to die
amount limited most desirable to every
person of small means, who might be
I able to save enough for the purpose. ?
The ;;toat advantage of citizens being
creditors as wcllua debtors, with relation
to t tie public debt, is obvious. Men
readily perceive that they can not be
much oppressed by ji debt which tlicy
owe to themselves. The public debt on
the first day of July last, although some
what cjcccedin^ the estimate of the
Secretary of the Treasury, made to Con
gress a. the commencement of tlio last
session, falls short of the. estimate of that
ollicer made in the preceding December
as to its probable amount at the begin
ning of this year, by the sum of SU.1W5,
071) *315. This fact exhibits a sati>lac
toty condition and conduct of the opera
tions of the Treasury.
It is of noteworthy interest, that the
steady expansion of population, im
provement and governmental institu- ;
lions over the new and unoccupied por
tions of our country, have scarcely been 1
checked, much less impeded or destroy
ed, by our grout civil war, which at first
gluncc would seem to have absorbed al- (
most the entire energies of the nation.
Tho income of sales of public lands
during the fiscal year ending June 30,
1SU4, was 6G7S.0U7 21 against $llit>,077
05 received during the preceding year.
The aggregate of acres surveyed during!
the year has been equal to the quantity
disposed of, and there is open to settle
ment about 13.'',UU'J,00U. aero of survey
ed land.
The groat enterprise of connecting
the Atlantic with the Pacific States by
railways and telegraph lines, has been
entered upon with a vijjor that gives as
surance of miccos, notwithstanding the
embarrassments ari>i t.g fiom the pre
vailing high ps ices of matei i.:l and labor.
The route of the main line of tho mad
| has teen definitely loeatei! for 1 00 miies
westward from the initial point at
Omaha City, Nebraska ; and a prelimi
nary location of the Pacific Uailrond of
Calitornia has been tnadu from Sacra
menio eastward to the real Heud ol
[Mucker Sliver. in Nevada.
! The Agricultural 1'epartmcnf. under
! the so pi riisiuii of its present imer^fti .?
xtd faithful he-id, is rapidly commend
i ing itseli to t he great and vital interest
|it was created to advance. It is pe n
I liarly the j copie s department, in whi< !i
they feci more directly concerned th.n
io any other. 1 com mend it to the eon
tinmd attention and fostering care of
Congress.
Til K WAR.
j TIjo waf continues. Since the last
[ .> it i* ua 1 message, all the important lines]
and positions then occupied \>y our
{forces have been maintained, and niirj
I armies liavc steadily ndvancl'd, thus,'
j liberating the rcgious left in the rear;
j so that Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee,
and part of other States, have again pro- j
duccd rea:<oualv lair crops.
The most remarkable feature in the I
military operations of (lie year is Gen.
; Sherman's attempted march of !)()0 miles
j directly through the insurgent region,
i It goes to show a great increase of our
relative strength, that our* General i n
Chief should feel able to confront and
?hold in ehcek every active force of the
enemy, and yet tu detach a well .appoint- j
ed large army to move on such an ex* I
pedition. ? The result not being yet
known, conjecture in regard to it is not
here indulged. Important movements
have al>o occurred during the year to
the effect of moulding soeiety for dura
bility in the Union. Although short of
complete success, it is so much in the
right direction, that ]^,0l>() citizens in
each of the States of Arkansas and
Louisiana have organized loyal State
Governments, with free Constitutions,
| and are earnestly struggling to main
i tain and administer them. The move
! ment in the same direction, more exten
sive, though less delinitc, iu Missouri,
Kentucky and Tennessee should not be
overlooked. Hut Maryland presents
the example of complete success, Mary
land is secure to liberty and Union for
all the future. The genius of rebellion
will no more claim Maryland. Like an
other foul spirit being driven out it may
seek to tear her but it will woo her no
more.
AMENDMENT OK THE CONSTITUTION.
At the last session of Congress n pro
posed amendment of the Constitution,
abolishing slavery throughout the
United States, passed the Senate, but
failed, for lack of the requisite two
thirds vote, in the House of Ilcpresen ta
li vcs. '
Although the present is the same
Congress, and nearly the same members,
without questioning the wisdom or patri
otism of those who stood in opposition,
! I venture to recommend the reconsiders
| tion and passage of the measure at the
session. Of coarse the abstract
j is not changed, but an inter
vening election shows, almost certainly
? present
that the next Congress will pass the
measure, if thin docs not; hence there is
only a question of time os to when the
propose*! amendment will go to the StatCH
tor their action, and as it is to go at all
events., may we not agree, that the soon
er the better? It is not claimed that
the election has imposed u duty on mem
bers to change their views or their votes
any further than as an additional ele
ment to be considered. Their judgment
may be allccled by it. It is the voice of
the people now lor the first time heard
upon the question. In u'grcat National
crisis like ours, unanimity of action
among those seeking a common end is
very dcMi-ublo, utmost indispensable, and
yet no approach to such unanimity is
attainable unless some deference shall be
paid to the will of majority, simply be
cause it i.< t ho will of the majority.
In this case tho common end is the
maintenance of the Union, and among
the mean 9 to secure that, end such will
through the election is most cle-irly de
clared in favor of such Constitutional
amendment. The most reliable indica
tion of public purpose in this country is
derived through our popular elections.
Judging by the recent canvass and its
rctult, the purpose of the people within
the loyal States to maintain the integrity
of the Union was never more lirtn nor
more nearly unanimous than now. The
extraordinary calmness and good order
vvitli which the millions of. voters met
and mingled at the polls gave strong as
surance of ihis. Not only all those who
supported the Union ticket, so called,
i.ut a great majority of the opposing
party also, may be fairly claimed to en
tertain, and to be actuated by the same
purpose.
It is- an unanswerable argument to
this dFeet, that no candidate for any of
fice, whether high or low, has ventured
lo seek votes on the avowal that he was
tor giving up the Union. There has
tHHMi much impugn in-; of motives, nod
in ii< li heated controversy as to the proper
means and best mode id' advancing the
I it ion cause, but in the distinct Usue ol
l.'niou or no Union, the politicians have
.-how ii their instinctive knowledge that
there is no diversity anions the people
in awarding the people the fair oppor
tunity of si:owing one to another and lo
the world this firmness and unanimity
of purpose.
The election lias been of vast value to
the National cause. The election has
exhibited another fact not less valuable
(u lie known; the lac t that we do not
ji (> I roach Cx'.au.-tion in the most impor
taut branch of the national resources,
that of living men. While it is melan
choly to l died that the War has lilted
no many graves and caused mourning to
so mail) homes, it is tome relief to know
that compared with the surviving the
fallen have been so few. Whole coip>
and divisions and brigades and regi
incuts have formed ami fought and
dwindled and gone out of exigence. ? |
A great majority of men who comprised j
I lie in arc still living. The same is true!
of the naval scrvicc. The election re- 1
turns prove this. So many voters could j
not. else bo found. The States regularly |
holding elections both now and four j
years ago? to wit : California, Connccti- 1
cut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana. Iowa,
Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachu-I
| setts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, j
[New Hampshire, New Jersey, Now
! York, Ohio, Oregon,. Pennsylvania.!
j Rhode Island, Vermont-, West Virginia
and Wisconsin cast 3, US-. 01 1 votes now,
against 3,870,222 cast then ; showing an
aggregate now of 3,982,011, to which is
I to be audod 33,702 east now in the new
| States of Kansas and Nevada, which
j States did not vote in JSUO ; thus swell
ling the aggrcjtfile to 4.01;"), 773, and the
' net inerca>c during the three years and
ja half of war to' 1 13,75 1 . A table is
1 appended Stowing the particulars. To
this again should be added the number.^
of all voters in the field from Massachu
setts, Ithode Island, Now Jersey, Dela
ware, Indiana, Illinois and California,
who, by the law of those States, cannot
vote away from their home, and which
| number cannot be less than 90,000, nor
I yet is this all. The number in organiz
ed territories is triple now what it was
four years ago, while thousands of white
'and black join us as the National arms
press back the insurgent lines.
So much is shown affirmatively and
negatively by the election. It is not
. material to inquire how the increase has
! been produced, or to show that it would
? have been greater but for the war, which
j is probably true. The important fact
j remains demonstrated that we liuve more
men now than we had when tho war be
gan, that we arc not exhausted nor in
process of exhaustion ; that we arc gain
I ing strength, and may, if need be, main
! tain the contest indefinitely. Material
! resources aro now more complete and
[abundant than ever. The National re
jMiurccs then arc unexhausted and, us we
i believe, inexhaustible. The public pur
| pose to re-establish and maintain the
1 National capacity is unchanged and, as
wo believe, unchangeable. The manner
of continuing tho effort remains . to
choose. ? , ?
On carcful consideration of ull the
evidence uccestiblc, it seems to me t h t
no attempt ut negotiations with the iu;
surgent leader coukl result in any pood,
lie would accept of nothingshort of the
severu nee of the Union. Ilia declara
tions to that effect are explicit nud of
repeated use. lie docs not attempt to
deceive, us. lie affords us no excusc
to deceive ourselves. We cannot volun
tarily yield it. .lietween him and us tho
issue is distinct, simple and inflexible.
It is an issue which can only be tried
by war and dcelded by .victory. ; . I f wo
yield, wo arc b'caton ; if the Southern
people fail him, he is beaten." Kitlicr
way it would be the -victory and defeat
following war. What is true, however,
of him who heads the insurgent cause,
is not necessarily true of those who fol
low. Although lie eon not re-accept
the Union, they can. Some of them,
we know, already desire peace and re
union. The number of such may in
crease. Thry can at any moment have
Itmcc'sunjily by laying down their arm*
and submit! iny to the A atinnul authority
under the Constitution. Alter so doing,
the Government could nor, if it would;
maintain war against them. The loyal
people would not sustain or allow it. II
questions should remain, we would ad
just them by peaceful moan* of legisla
tion, conference, courts and votes, operat
ing only in coustitution.il and lawful
channels. Some certain, and other pos
sible,. questions are, and would lie, be
yond the executive power to adjust; for
instance, the udmisAion of members into
Congress, and whatever might require
the appropriation of money. The execu
tive power itself would be greatly dimin
ished by the cessation of actual war.
1'ardons and remissions of forfeiture,
however, w?>u!d still be within executive
control. In what spirit anil temper this
control would be exerei.-ed can be fairly
judged ol by the p:|St. A year ago,
general pardon and amnesty, upon speci
lud terms, were ofleri-d to all except cer
tain designated enemies, and it was at
i he same time made known that the ex
peeled classes were still within contcm
plation of special clemency. During the
year many availed themselves of the
general piovision, and tuuiiy mure wo\ild.
only that the signs of bad fjith in some
led to such precautionary measures a>
rendered the practical process less easy
and certain. Dining the same time,
also, special pardons have been grunted
to individuals of expected classes, and no
voluntary application has been denied.
I lius, particularly, the door has been
for a full year open to all except such
us were not in a condition to make free
choice; that is, such as were in custody
or under constraint. It is stil! open to
ull, but the time may come, probably
will come, when public duty shall do
manu that it he closed, and that in lieu
more vigorous measures thau heretofore
shall be adopted.
In presenting the abandonment of
aimed resistance to the National author
ity, on the part of the insurgents, as the
only indispcnsihlc condition to ending
the war on the part of the Government.
I retract nothing heretofore said as to
slavery. I repeat the declaration made
a year a jo, that while I remain in my
present position, I shall not attempt to
retract or modify the Emancipation
Proclamation, nor shall I return to
slavery any person who is free by the
terms of that proclamation or by any of
I the acts of Congress. If the people
j should, by whatever mode or means,
j make it my executive duty to re enslave
such persons, another, and not I. must
I be their instrument to perform it. .In
stating a single condition of peace, I
mean simply to say that the war will
cease on the part of the Government
whenever it shall have ceased on the
part of those who began it.
