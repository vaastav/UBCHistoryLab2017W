FEDERAL LAW MAKERS.
"Washington, Dec. 3. —The senate
listened to the first message of Presi
dent Roosevelt and adopted a resolu
tion for the appointment of a com
mittee to cooperate with a like com
mittee from the house to consider by
what token of respect and affection
congress might express the sorrow of
the nation upon the tragic death of
the late President McKinley. At the
conclusion of the reading of the mes
sage Senator Fcraker presented the
McKinley resolution, and, as a further
mark of respect, the senate ad
journed.
Not in many years have the mem
bers of the house listened with such
rapt attention to the annual message
of the president of the United States
as they did to the reading of the first
message of Roosevelt. Several times
there was applause and at the con
clusion there was an enthusiastic
demonstration on the republican side.
On motion of Mr. Grosevnor of Ohio
that portion of the message relating
to the death of the late president -was
to a committee to consist of
one member from each state to join
a similar committee of the senate to
consider and report by what token of
respect and affection it may be proper
for congress to express the deep sen
sibility of the nation to the tragic
death of the late president. The
speaker appointed a committee head
by Mr. Grosvenor. A bill to punish
assassination or attempted assassina
tion of the president and other high
government officials was introduced.
A measure was also introduce and ex
tending the Chinese exclusion law
twenty years. A more stringent Im
migration law was also proposed.
Speaker Henderson may not announce
the house committee assignments
untill after the holidays.
Washington, Dec. 4.—Practically the
entire time of the senate r\as devoted
to the introduction of bills ajid resolu
tions. Two of these measures, relat
ing to the suppression of anarchy and
dealing with anarchists, were allowed
to lie on the table so their authors.
Senators McCombs of Maryland and
Vest of Missouri, may bring them to
the early attention of the senate. The
isthmian canal report was transmit
ted to the senate by the president and
several bills providing for the con
struction of waterways, one by Sen
ator Morgan of Alabama, who has led
the movement for the canal in the
past, were presented. Senator Me-
Comas’ resolution declares that con
gress has the power and should by
law provide that persons who wil
fully kill or assault with intent to
kill the president or vice president or
both or any officer upon whom the
powers and duties of the president
may devolve shall be punished with
death, the federal courts to have juris
diction over such offenses. Senator
Hoar introduce*! a bill which provides
that any person who shall wilfully kill
or cause the death of a president of
the United States or any officer thereof,
or who shall wilfully kill or cause the
death of a ruler or chief magistrate of
anj foreign country snail be punished
v\ith death; also that the attempt tc
commit such murder shall be punished
with death. The president transmits
the new Hay-Pauncefote treaty for the
isthmian canal. Senator Morgan’s
bill for the construction of the Nicara
guan canal appropriates a sum neces
sary to complete the project. Sena
tor Perkins’ bill on the same project
provides for the perpetual lease by
the United States of the right of way
across Nicaragua and Costa Rica and
confers military, police and sanitary
control of the canal route by the
United States. It makes an appropria
tion of $120,000,000 of which $12,000,-
000 is to be expended annually. Sena
tor Lodge introduced a bill provid
ing that the tariff passed by the
Philippine commission September 17,
1901, shaP remain in full force and ef
fect. This covers goods going into
the islands. Senator Lodge also in
troduced a bill providing for the re
moval of the ten years limitation on
the Chinese exclusion act, thus leav- j
ing the provisions of the Geary act in I
force.
Washington, Dec. 5. —The text of
the new Hay-Pauncefote treaty, pro
viding- for construction of a canal
across the isthmus of Panama, sent
to the senate Wednesday, was made
public. The canal is to be free and
open to the vessels of commerce and
war of all nations observing the rules
substantially as embodied in the con
vention of Constantinople, signed
October 2S. 1888, for the free naviga
tion of the Suez canal. The cana
shall never be blockaded, nor shall
any right of war bs exercised nor any
act of hostility be committed within
it. The United States, however, shall
be at liberty to police, and protect
and build and manage it.
Senator McComas of Maryland
made an extended speech with
anarchy for his theme and was follow
ed by some brief remarks by Senator
Hoar of Massachusetts on the dif
ficulties in the way of dealing with
anarchist assassins. Senator Mc-
Comas maintained that congress had
full power under the constitution to
enact a law punishing with death any
person killing the president or as
saulting the president with intent to
kill or aiding, inciting or procuring
such an act. He favored rigid pro
visions in the immigration laws for
the deportation of alien anarchists
Senator Hoar said the difficulty was
that assassins of the kings and rulers
always gloried in their crimes and
were in no wise deterred by the fear
of punishment. For this reason he
thought it - -was almost useless tc
multiply punishments. The most
effective remedy, he suggested, would
be to have the civilized nations of th*
world agree upon some desolate spo
on the earth’s surface, to which all
anarchists who upheld assassination
or the overthrow of government
should be transported. In such a
community the anarchists could carry
our their theories of living withou*
government and the world would b:
rid of their presence. Senator Pen
rose introduc-.d a bill for the regula
tion of immigration, prepared by him
self and the commissioner general of
immigration, which looks to a general
revision of the laws upon this ques
tion. It provides for a duty of $3 per
head on all persons coming into the
United States from foreign countries
except those who are citizens of this
country or of Canada or Mexico.
Washington, Dec. 6.—Representa
tive Gardner of New Jersey intro
duced a joint resolution authorizing
the state department to purchase the
Danish West Indies and appropriating
not exceeding $4,000,000 for that pur
pose. Mr. Crumpacker (Ind.) intro
duced a bill for an amendment to the
apportionment act so the membership
of the house will be 372, based on the
vote cast instead of on population. It
reduces the representation in the
southern states and makes an increase
in the northern states. Mr. Taylor
(Ohio) introduced a bill to pension
Mrs. McKinley at the rate of $5,000
a year, beginning Sept. 14, 1901, the
date of the death of the late presi
dent. A bill introduced by Mr. Brown
low (Tenn.) for the creation of a
park in the southern Appalachian
mountains, provides that the park
shall be called McKinley national
park and shall contain 4,000.000 acres.
Speaker Henderson announced the

mittees:

Washington. Dec. 9. —The senate
chamber was the scene of a highly
dramatic episode when. Senator Till
man of South Carolina challenged
his colleague. Senator McLaurin, to
resign with him on the spot in order
that they might be able “to wash
their dirty linen at home.” Senator
McLaurin did not take up the griage
The incident was a direct sequel of
the bitter controversy which arose
between the senators in South
Carolina last spring.
Senator McLaurin arose to a ques
tion of personal privilege and pro
ceeded to explain what he charged
was a conspiracy to discredit him in
his own state for acts and views
which did not meet the approval of
certain democratic leaders. He de
clared be was being humiliated any
according to public prints was to be
excluded from the democratic caucus
because he had acted upon certain
public issues in a way which he con
sidered was for the best interest of
the country and the people of nis
state. He announced himself a be
liever in the old democracy and after
denouncing the new democratic
leaders who, he said, had brought
destruction upon the party, de
clared he could not be driven from
his eld allegiance into a party with
which he did not care to affiliate
Senator Jones, chairman of the
democratic national committee, de
nied that he had any ulterior motives
in not inviting Senator McLaurin to
enter the caucus. Senator Tillman
reviewed the whole cotroversy.
Senator Lodge presented in execu
tive session a report of the com-'
mittee on foreign relations, recom
mending favorable action upon the
Hay-Pauncefote isthmian canal
treaty. Senator Hoar offered a
resolution to authorize the preside/'
to enter into negotiations with other
civilized countries for the purpose of
selecting some island or other suit
able territory to which might be
transported and confined nersc-ng
instigating or counseling the destruc
tion of all government or those at
tempting the lives of chief magis
trates. It was referred to the com
miftee on foreign relations. Sena'or
Hoar introduced a hill giving the
United States jurisdiction in cases of
lynching and making the crime of
participation in lynchings punishable
by death.

WRECKS DITCH TRAIN.
Oregon Passenger Piles Up at Sharp
Curve.
, Portland, Ore., Dec. 7. —An east
bound passenger train on the Oregon
Railway and Navigation line was
wrecked twelve miles east of the
Dalles yesterday afternoon. The en
gine turned completely over and the
mail car and composite sleeper and
diner left the track. The other cars
remained on the track. Engineer
Cavanaugh was badly scalded and in
ternally hurt. Fireman Crase was
seriously injured. None of the pas
sengers were injured. The wreck
was undoubtedly the work of train
wreckers as a 7-8 inch square nut had
been placed on the outside rail of the
threee-degree curve. Another nut
was also found on the outside rail
about TOO -feet ahead of the first one.
FATHER OF WATERS LOW.
Twin City Flour Mills Must Fall Back
on Steam.
Minneapolis, Dec. 7. —The Missis
sippi river is unprecedentedly low. The
flour mills have been forced to fall
back on steam largely, and one of the
street railway companies has been
forced to cut down its service in Min
neapolis, St. Paul and Stillwater and
has begun the operation of its steam
plant which has long been lying idle.
The deficiency of water is attributed
partly to the lack of fall rains and
partly to the fact Aat loggers on the
headwaters are impounding w r ater in
streams so as to float out their cut
next spring.

APPARATUS TO BRAKE SHIPS.
A Montrealer’s Invention to Check Ves
sets Going at Full Speed.
A contrivance for stepping ocean
vessels while going at normal speed
has been on view in the board of
trade during this week. It is an in
ventiou of Mr. Ix>uis Lacost-"', chief
justice of the court of appeals, who
has patented it. The apparatus, of
w’hich Mr. Lacoste exhibited models ’n
a tank, consists of one or more pair c
of doors, attached to each side of a
ship, which can be opened by steam
electricity or compressed air. The
doors are fitted with hinges and iron
bars, and offer a strong resistance to
the water, and stopping the vessel
within a few hundred feet and without
any sudden shock. By opening only
one door the ship can be brought
around much quicker, than can be
done by her rudder only. The inven
tion, which has been submitted to the
British admiralty, has been viewed oy
a large number of the shipping and
commercial men of Montreal, who
wore mostly favorably impressed
by it.
Mr. Geo. W. Noll, chief engineer of
hex majesty s ship Tribune, has ■vfrit
ten to Mr. Louis Lacoste in regard to
the device that, after seeing the
models, he believes it to be practi
cable on the lines shown, and to be a
great factor of safety. Mr. John H
Glass, engineer of the Allan liner
Tunisian, goes further even than Mr
Noll, pronouncing the brake absolute
ly efficient and calculated tc stop a sea
going steamer going at full speed
within her own length. Less tech
nical opinion has been also favorably
impressed with Mr. device

ADVICE TO GUESTS.
Curious Maxims Laid Down for Table
Manners.
That our ancestors were not so well
managed as we are is evident from
the following rules, which were laid
down by Tommasin von Zlrkler, a
German poet, in regard to the conduct
of a host and his guest at a dinner
party. These singular maxims were
recently unearthed, and have now
been reprinted;
“Every guest should take care that
his guests have enough to eat. and
that they are not served with dishes
that they do not want. In return, the
guests should behave properly, and
should be satisfied with whatever is
placed before them.
“A guest should not eat all his
bread before the first dishes are
served, neither should he eat with
both hands nor drink nor talk when
his mouth is full.
“It is not polite to turn toward
one’s neighbor and to offer him a
wine cup from which one is still drink
ing.
“One should not eat greedily and
hastily, as though the dinner had been
paid for, neither should one take any
food from his neighbor’s plate. In a
word, each person should accept what
is offered to him and ask for nothing
else.
“When there is someone sitting on
the right hand it is permissible to
eat with the left hand.
“While one is drinking, the eyes
should be steadily fixed on the wine
cup.
“It is improper to place one’s baud
in a dish while another person is tak
ing some food from it.
“One should always have the hands
clean and the nails cut short, as other
wise those persons who are eating
from the same dish are likely to be
come disgusted.
“A guest should never put his el
bows on the table, neither should he
chatter all the time nor clean his
teeth with a knife.’’
