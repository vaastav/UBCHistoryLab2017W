WHY EVERY DEMOCRAT
NORIH
The people of North Dakota are the
best people i'i the world. If you can
show them you are right, they will
stand by and support you. But the
difficulty is in being able to "show"
1 them. Unless you can call upon each
one individually—which is an absolute
impossibility —you must resort to
some means of publicity. There is no
:.
publicity equal to or so effective as
newspaper publicity. It is better than
^circular letters, pamphlets posters or
anything else. Besides when the cam
paign is on voters are deluged with
that sort of publicity and they are
forced to lay much of it aside. Now

turn to a subject which I hope
can be handled promptly and without
serious controversy of any kind. I
mean the method of selecting nomi
nees for the presidency of the United
States. I feel confident that I do not
misinterpret the wishes or the expec
tations of the country when 1 urge the
prompt enactment of legislation which
will provide for primary elections
throughout the country at which the
voters of the several parties may
choose their nominees for the presi
dency without the intervention of
nominating conventions. I venture
the suggestion that this legislation
should provide for the retention of
party conventions, but only for the
purpose of declaring and accepting the
verdict of the primaries and formu
lating the platforms of the parties
and I suggest that these conventions
should consist not of delegates chosen
for this single purpose, but of the
nominees for congress, the nominees
for vacant seats in the senate of the
United States, the senators whose
terms have not yet closed, the nation
al committees, and the candidates
for the presidency themselves. In or
der that platforms may be framed by
those responsible to the people for
carrying them into effect.
Philippine Policy.
These are all matters of vital do
mestic concern, and besides them, out
side the charmed circle of our own na
tional life in which our affections
command us, as well as our con
sciences, there stand out our obliga
tions toward our territories over sea
Here we are trustees. Porto Rico,
Hawaii, the Philippines, are ours, In
deed, but not ours to do what we
please with. Such territories, once re
garded as mere possessions, are no
longer to be selfishly exploited they
are part of the domain of public con
science and of serviceable and en
lightened statesmanship. We must
administer them for the people who
live in them and with the same sense
of responsibility to them as toward
our own people in our domestic af
fairs. No doubt we shall successfully
enough bind Porto Rico and the Ha
waiian islands to ourselves by ties -of
justice and Interest and affection, but
the performance of our duty toward
the Philippines is'a more difficult and
debatable matter. We can satisfy the
obligations of generous justice toward
the people of Porto Rico by giving
them ample and familiar rights and
privileges accorded our own citizens
in our own territories and our obliga
tions toward the people of Hawaii by
perfecting the provisions for self
government already granted them, but
In the Philippines we must go further.
We must hold steadily in view thtflr
ultimate independence, and we must
move toward the time of that inde
pendence as steadily as the way can
be cleared and- the foundations
thoughtfully and permanently laid.

Government Railroads In Alaska.
A duty faces us with regard to Alas
ka which seems to me very pressing
and very imperative perhaps I should
say a double duty, for it concerns both
the political and the material develop
ment of the territory- The people of
Alaska should be given the full terri
torial form of government, and Alas
ka, as a storehouse, should be un
locked. One key to it is a system of
railways. These the government
should itself control in the Interest of
all who wish to use them for the serv
ice and development of the country
and its people.
Rut the construction of railways is
only the first step is only thrusting in
the key to the storehouse and throw
ing back the lock and opening the
door. How the tempting resources of
the country are to be exploited is an
other matter, .to which I shall take
the liberty of from time to time call
ing your attention, for it is a policy
which must be worked out by well
considered stages, not upon theory,
but upon the Unes of practical. expe
diency. It is part of our general prob
lem of conservation. We have a freer
hand In working out the problem in
Alaska than In the states of the union
and yet the principle and object are
the same, wherever we touch it. .We
must use the resources of the coun
try, not lock them up. There need be
no conflict rjealousy as between
state and federal authorities, for there
can be no essential direrence of pur
pose between them- The resources
in question must be used, but not de
stroyed or wasted used, but not mon
opolized upon any narrow idea of In
dividual rights as against the abiding
interests of communities. That a pol
icy can be worked out by conference
and concession which will release
these resources and yet not jeopard
or dissipate them, I for one have no
doubt and It can be done on lines of
regulation which need be no less ac
ceptable to the people and govern
state
ments of the states concerned than
to the people and government of the
nation at large, whose heritage these
resources are We must bend our
counsels to this end. A common pur
pose ought to make agreement easy.

of mine labor and making the mines
mor economically productive as well
as more safe. This Is an all-tmpdrtant
part of the work of conservation and
the conservation of human life and
energy lies even nearer to our Interest
than the preservation from waste of
our material resources.
Employers' liability Act.
We owe It. In mere justice to the
railway employees of the. country, to
provide for them a fair an deffective
employers' liability act and a law
that we can stand by in this matter
will be no less to the advantage of
those who administer the railroads of
the rountry than to tho advantage of
those whom they employ- The expe
rience of a largo number of the states
abundantly proves that.
We ought to devote ourselves to
meeting pressing demands of plain
justice like this as earnestly as to the
accomplishment of political an dcco
nomic reforms, ocial justice comes
first. Law is the machinery for its
realization and is vital only as it ex
presses and embodies it.
Safety at Sea.
An international congress for the
discussion of all questions that affect
safety at sea is now sitting in London
at the suggestion of our own govern
ment. So soon as the conclusions of
that congress can be learned and con
sidered we ought to address ourselves,
among other things, to the prompt al
leviation of the very unsafe, unjust,
and burdensome conditions which now
surround the employment of sailors
and render it extremely difficult to ob
tain the services of spirited and com
petent men such as every ship needs
if It is to be safely handled .and
brought to port.
Admiration for Congress.
Slay I not express the very real
pleasure I have experienced in co
operating with this congress and shar
ing with it the labors fcommon serv
ice to which it has devoted itself so
unreservedly during the past seven
months of uncomplaining concentra
tion upon the business of legislation
Surely it is a proper and pertinent part
of my report on "the state of the un
ion" to express my admiration for the
diligence, the good temper, and the
full comprehension of public duty
which has already been manifested by
both the houses and I hope that it
may. not be deemed an impertinent
(intrusion of myself Into the picture if
I say with how much and how con
stant satisfaction I have availed my
self of the privilege of putting my time
and energy at their disposal alike in
counsel and in action-
It supports the theory fathered by
one philisopher that if one really
wants money in New York he has but
to go out and get it First, of course,
he must provide himself with an en
ticing little fairy story.

thing that pleases me most about it
Is that it has kept up a constant and
consistent fight for better laws and
better politics and has been among
the foremost progressives of the na

for a newspaper to fight the battles of
the people, when by doing so they
knew that they would have the money
interests arrayed against them, and
the money interests have controlled
the politics of this state In former
years, and unless their bidding was
done a newspaper was deprived of
public patronage. I feel sura that
your paper would be of a very great
benefit to the democratic party
