THK PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The president's message, which is pub
lished in full this morning, begins with a
*®view of the work of the state depart
ment, which the events of the year have
tendered exceptionally interesting. Re
ciprocal trade arrangements have been
entered into with Brazil, Spain and San
Domingo. The terms of the arbitration
of the Bering sea controversy have i>cen
agreed upon between Great Britain and
the United States, and it only remains to
■ agree upon the arbitrators to complete the
convention. Germany, Denmark, Italy,
Austria and France have opened their
markets to American pork products be
fore our legislative threat to exclude from
Mir markets the products of any country
perpetrating unjust discrimination against
the products of the United States.
The president truthfully describes the
lynching of the Mafia at New Orleans as a
discreditable, as well as deplorable inci
ient, an offense agr.inst law and human
ity, and points out that through the iaii
nre of congress to make offenses against?'
the treaty rights ot foreigners, domicj&>d
in the United States, cognizable ig, the
federal court, the United Statea courts
have no power in cases to intervene
•Ither tor the protection of /the foreign
Citizen or for the punishment c f his s i a y.
•rs. The president thinks that the federal
government is anaweratf le for the ads of
the officers of the charged with po
lice and judicial j n cases where it
would be if the United States
had exercised power to
define and npih crimes against treaty
rights. W
In the ma£f cer Q f Chile our government
•Imply by the policy which it in
listed ujm,n on the part of Europe during
war. The Itata was seized for
jf Violation of our neutrality laws, broke her
arrest and put to sea; but her surrender
f was promptly ordered by the junta of the
eongressional party. No official complaint
•f the conduct of our minister to Chile or
our naval officers or of the policy of our
government has been made. For the out
rage committed upon the sailors of the
Baltimore our government has notified
Chile that it would expect full and prompt
reparation. The reply of the Chilean sec
retary of foreign affairs was offensive in its
tone, and the government is now awaiting
on adequate and satisfactory response to
its demand for satisfaction.
The president announces that under the
direction of the inter-continental railway
commission nearly 1,000 miles of the pro
posed railway has been surveyed, includ
ing the most difficult part, that through
Ecuador and Southern Colombia. The
president strongly recommends the equip
ment of Pearl harbor in the Hawaiian
Islands as a United States naval station.
Our government has officially remon
r strated with the czar of Russia against the
harsh measures now being enforced against
his Hebrew subjects, measures which
Within a few years will expel 1,000,000 of
persons from Russia and increase an emi
gration to the United States that will stri
ps ouslv affect our labor market.
, N -. The construction of the Nicaragua
feanal is a matter of supreme commercial
Interest to the Pacific coast, and the presi
dent declares it a matter of the highest
concern to the United States that this
canal should be speedily built. The gain
of freight to the people and to the govern
ment of the United States in the use of
f naval vessels by tin* short water commu
nication between the Atlantic and l'acitic
would soon pay for its cost. President
Harrison commands the assent of every
Intelligent man on this Coast when he de
clares his entire agreement with United
States Senator Morgan's opinion that "the
Ni caragn* canal is the most important
subject now connected with the commer
cial growth and progress of the United
States." This view of the Democratic sen
ator from Alabama was identical with
that of Senator John Sherman, and
with the leading minds of both
the gTeat parties of the country in exact
accord upon this subject there would seem
to be no good reason why congress should
not push this grea* work rapidly to com
|;v, pletion by a government loan, like that
granted the Union Pacific railroad. The
|t| president favors the guaranty of the bonds
of the canal company by the United
States, which would give them a ready
■ale at par as a 3 per cent, bond, thu* s.iv-
Ing the marketing of the bonds at a heavy
discount which would retard the rapid con
struction of this great national commercial
T . waterway. . The president deems the
Nicaragua canal of such transcendent in
terest that the government would t>e
fied in securing it by direct appropriations
from Its treasury. The guaranty of the
bonds of the canal company to an amount
necessary to its completion could be given
without any serious risk of ultimate loss.
The president makes a humane appeal to
congress to provide legislation that shall
> protection of our federal courts to
American labor upon the West Indian
Island of Navassa belonging to the United
States. At present the discipline main
tained upon this island is as barbarous and
despotic as that of a convi, t camp. The
president urges that the protect m of our
federal jurisdiction be at once thrown
about American labor yn the island which
is now governed only by the arbitrary vxul
m of the Navassa Phosphate Company.
mm- International copyrigl '- has been s. cured
IK with Belgium, France, (ireat Britain and
HI Switzerland, while wit* Germany a special
m convention hS3 KM** 8 al
that country within the reciprocal benefits
of our legislation.
Concerning the tariff, the president says
that the evil prophecies of its opponents
have not been fulfilled, while in a large
measure the §ct has realized the hopeful
predictions of its friends. Our total
foreign commerce, imports and exports,
from October 1, I**o, to .September 1, 1891,
exceeds the largest in any previous year,
that of 1890 by over $100,000,000. Our im
ports of merchandise for the. year are
111.000,000 over the imports of I*9o. The
value of free imports for the year exceeds
that of lA9O by $118,092,3*7; and there is a
decrease of |l'V>'>l t 3oß in the value of
dutiable imports. The percentage of
merchandise admitted free of duty
during the year is larger than during
any prior fiscal year in our history.
Our exports lor the year ending September
30. I*9l. show an increase over the exports
of the previous year of nearly $<53.0 H.OOO,
which is three times the average annual
increase of exports during any year of our
history. The president believes that the
new tariff has created several great indus
tries which will within a few years give
employment to several hundred thousand
American working men and women. The
Uriff, despite the reduction of revenue by
placing sugar on the free list and the re
duction in the volume of dutiable imports
leaves the treasury with an ample surplus,
actual and estimated, up to June 30, 1593.
The president would not disturb the exist
ing silver act of July, 1890.
Under it the government is now buying
and putting out of the market what is the
equivalent of the entire product of our
silver mines. Under the present silver
act every dollar of the treasury notes is
sued rests on a lull dollar's worth ot" silver
bullion deposited in the treas lry, and Vhe
treasury department is aule to
the parity in the use of coin.. r.ars and
their paper representatives coin
age would be disastrous, fq*» as the presi
dent says, "While the/' money lender
would protect himself * r , y stipulating tor
payment in gold tb.e laborer has never
been able to do The president is a
bi-metallist, w \y' j 3 ready for a full coin use
of silver jJift. as soon as the co-operation
ol othgv nations can be secured,
and -,r ra tj o fixed that will give cir
culation equally to gold and silver.
VT bile there is no present prospect of an
international conference and agreement
there is a growing sentiment in Europe in
favor of a larger issue of silver. The
amount of money in circulation March 1,
1889, was $1,404,1305,890, while on the Ist of
December, 1891, it had increased to $1,577,-
202,070. One-half of the per cent, bonds
have been extended at 2 per cent, and the
rest were paid on presentation.
The revenues of the postoffice depart
ment show nn increase of $50,000,600,
while an estimate for the year 1891 shows
a surplus of receipts over expenditures.
The president urges the completion of a
first-class modern navy adequate to the
protection of our citizens and our com
merce in all seas, and to the full defense
of both our Atlantic and Pacific coasts.
On the subject of irrigable lands the
president points out that without prompt
legislation by congress and state legisla
tures private corporations will have unre
stricted control of one of the elements of
life, and the patentees of the arid lands
will be tenants at will of the water com
panies. The president holds that the
United States should part with its owner
ship of the water sources and the sites for
reservoirs, whether to the states and terri
tories or to individuals or corporations,
only upon condition that will insure to
the settlers their proper water supply
upon equal and reasonable terms.
The president renews his appeal for pro
tection to railroad employes by the enact
ment of a law requiring of every railway
engaged in interstate commerce the equip
ment each year of a given number of its
freight cars with automatic couplers and
airbrakes and couplers to be used.
The closing portion of the message is
devoted to the presentation of an exceed
ingly able and statesmanlike argument,
urging the elimination by constitutional
amendment of government l>y "gerry
mander" from national politics. The ac
tion of the Democratic legislature of
Michigan is made the text of the president's
argument in favor of a "constitutional
amendment which will secure uniformity
and prevent that disgraceful partisan jug
glery to which such a liberty of choice, if
it exists, oilers \ temptation."
The president urges that we take, by
consent, one step in the direction of re
form by eliminating the gerrymander,
which has been denounced by all parties
as an induence in the election of elec:ors
of president and nietnliersof congress."
The president concludes this timely and
exceedingly ai le protect :> viinst our alarm
ing drit't toward coveruinent by "gerry
mander" as follows:
Ail the state* hr, >€®n acting frei-'.T and
separately at.i have determined that the choice
of electors by a general ticket in the wise*t atid
■licit ir.ettifl, »i;id it w J »■ m that there

t'.e House of Kepreteu .at.vea. The power of
centres* .» a-;ii>le to deal with ih;s threatening
and intolerable abuv.
The message is long, but could nit well
have been shorter, and in arrangement
and composition is a memorably able state
paper. Without a trace of partisanship it
Is nevertheless a powerful plea in justifi
cation of t iie policy and administration of
the Republican party.
I'KNSION!*.
The report of the Secretary of the In
terior shows that under the act of June,
1890, granting pensions to soldiers and
sailors incapacitated for the performance
of manual labor, and providing for pen
sions to widows, wives, children or de
pendent parents, thousands of disabled
veterans have been relieved, stricken
since the days of service, or who. through
lapse of time, can no longer prove their
disability to have been incurred in the line
of duty. Its benefits have a : io been ex
tended to many thousands more of
widows, orphans and dependent parents
of such veterans.
The pension roll June 3U, 1891, was
076.100 strong, and probably today is not
far from 700,(XK), or 150,000 more than was
carried on the rolls at the close of the
last fiscal year. This dependent pension
act probably marks the limit of pension
legislation for the future. The lead
ing men of the O. A. R., like General
Alger and Judge Vearey, discourage
in their public addresses any attempt to
persuade congress to grant a service pen
sion without discrimination to every man
whose name, lor a long o; short term, was
borne upon the roils of the Union army
whether he today is sick or weil, self-sup
porting or indigent. A general service
pension bill of this indiscriminating char
acter would be equivalent to asking con
gress to enact extortion and extravagance.
Everybody knows that out of the 2,250,-
000 to 2,500,000 men whose names, from first
to last were borne on the roll of the Union
army there were at least a million of
men who were obtained when volunteer
ing ceased, the draft became necessary,
and the evil days of substitutes, great
bounties, bounty jumpers, desertion
and re-enlistments were upon us.
Of this million of mercenaries
thousands did gallant service, but there
were also thousands who were skulks on
the battlefield, hospital shirks, deserters,
fellows who came into the Union army for
nothing but bounties, pay and rations;
the vilest scoundrels and scrapings of
great cities. These creatures suffered no
hardship or peril they couid escape; they
came into the army too late for the fight
ing of 1863 at Gettysburg at the East (yr
Chattanooga at the West, and the
are that having escaped the three yvars of
service from May, 1861, to May, 180t. their
ranks are fuller today than'the ranks of
the million of men that the government
obtained by volunteering before the draft
and big bounties became necessary to get
m< n. Under a. service pension every man
of these sccundrels and deadbeats would
become u life charge upon the govern
ment. The government today is obliged
to (fare for them when they are incapable
of ,self-support by manual labor, but the
prospect of a service pension to men who
ntfver rendered any service they could
I'vade or desert is intolerable.
A service pension to surviving veterans
entirely capable of self-support would be
an unjust burden upon the hard-working
labor of the country. The nation has
done more than stern justice already; it
lifts been generous, and it is time to call a
halt on pensions. Nearly a generation
has passed away since the war. The pen
sions charge per capita in 1871 was 87
cents; in 1889, $1.74. In 1871 the pensions
came to $34,443,894; in 1891 the pensions
amounted to $ 106,493,000; and the total
pensions for the year ending July 1, 1892,
are estimated by Commissioner Raum at
$116,000,000, or $9,000,000 less than the con
gressional estimate and appropriation.
The pension bill for 18U3, it is estimated,
will not reach $150,000,000, and from that
time forward the commissioner estimates
there will be a reduction In the ex
penditure for pensions, but this pre
diction of Commissioner Raum can
not possibly be verified if we
repeat the legislation, whose bad precedent
was established when a Democratic con
gress enacted the Mexican war service
bill, thousands of whose beneficiaries
never saw Mexico and thousands of others
are possessed of a competence.
A service pension would be a most in
tolerable act of unjust legislation; its
enactment will be impossible, we believe,
and ought to command the inflexible oppo
sition of every thoughtful, patriotic
veteran in the land. These are the views
of the wisest and most sagacious chiefs
of the G. A. R. as we find them publicly
and privately expressed.
SUGAR FACTS.
The following figures will answer the in
quiries of a correspondent concerning
sugar: The United States produces of
cane sugar from 125,000 to 140,000 hogs
heads. The product of Louisiana for
1884-85 was 94,500 tons. Our annual
maple sugar product is about 15,000 tons.
Louisiana consumes about 70 per cent, of
her sugar crop. As long ago as 1874-75 we
imported over 630,000 tons of sugar, and
our sugar imports for IS9O were 2,934,011,-
500 pounds, valued at over $96,000,000.
The cane sugar production of the United
States is confined to Louisiana, which is
too far north to make it a first-class sugar
producing country, as may be seen by the
fact that the island of Cuba, without half
trying to develop its sugar-growing capac
ity, produced in 1884-85 over 627,000 tons of
cane sugar; the other West Indian
islands produced 300,000 tons; Bra
zil, 269,000 tons; Java, 310,000
tons; Manilla. 203.000 tons; the little
island of Mauritius, in the Indian ocean,
produced in ISB4-85 over 203,000 tons as
against Louisiana's 94,5f)0 tons, and De
merara, in Guiana, South America, pro
duced 100,000 tons.
Germany produced of beet sugar in
18 v 4-S5 over 1,155,000 tons; Austria-Hun
gary. 558,000 tons; France, 308,000 tons,
and Russian Poland 387.000 tons.
The United States cannot at its best pro
duce over 100,000 tons of cane sugar an
nually, while its annual consumption of
•ugar will exceed 1,000,000 tons. The to
tal annual consumption of sugar by the
United States fifteen years ago was over
800,000 tons, and the figures of our sugar
it p rts for l-:«0 which we have given in
pounds show that our annual suc;ar con
sumption largely exceeds 1,000,000 tons.
Our Louisiana sugar makers as a rule use
all the latest improved scientific methods
of sugar culture and sugar making, while
Cuba does not, and yet Cuba with little
effort produces six times the annual pro
duct of Louisiana and markets it ail in the
United States.
Our Louisiana cane sugar erowers, our
boot sus;ar and maple sugar makers,
since sugar was placed on the free list,
have been paid a bounty, which for the
year has amounted to between nine and
ton millions of dollars. The people have,
after paving this bounty of ten millions
to our domestic sugar growers, made a
net saving of nearly J."*),000,000 by placing
sugar on the free list. We cannot raise
our own sug.tr, for the climate is against
it. Louisiana raised 25,000 tons as
ear.y as 1*1?, and with ail her growth
of population, improved machinery and
processes of sugar making she has never
raised more than 100,000 tons.
We are too far north for cane sugar
making; what we may yet do with the
beet su:rar industry can only be deter
mined by thorough trial extending over
a number of years, but at present sugar
is not a competing industry and is there
fore properly placed on the free list in
our tariff, which, however, allows our
domestic sugar growers a bounty.
Mr. Thomas Henderson Boyd assumes
control of the Olympia Morning Olympian
today, and will hereafter be responsible for
its utterances. It is safe to say that under
Mr. Boyd's direction the O'ympian will
become a power in the state. He is an
able, a• well as a strong and forcible,
writer, and his familiarity with the poli
tics of the state is unrivalled. He is one

nized. It is safe to say that he will soon
secure for the Olympian a position of
power and influence.
As was generally anticipated, the city
council last evening elected George W.
Hall mayor to fill the unexpired terra of
Harry White. Mr. Hall's eminent quali
fications for this position were referred to
by the POST-IXTELLIGEXCEB at the time of
Mayor White's resignation. It is suffi
cient to say at this time that Mr. Hall is
an old and respected citizen of Seattle,
that his personal integrity is above ques
tion, and that there is every reason to ex
pect from him a safe, careful and success
ful administration.
The Jester—who grinned at the scanty fare they
spread at the royal board.
And tittered a more Jest than prayer ana
wore to the guests thau the Lord:
wrinkled his (ace with a wry grimace,
while the peoplo i aghast
jk t the sackcloth uuder the purple robes ol their
King, as he went past.
The Jester—whose merry gibes were heard in all
that doieful while—
Should he wear sackcloth like the King— why
Famine's self would smile.
He—light and empty of heart and thought as
the jingling be is he wore—
He would laugh at the sackcloth and Jest at the
ache of the heart it covered o'er.
WeU might the King wear sackcloth; his were
a nation's woes,
And every sob from a million lips was one of
his own heart's throes;
The tear* of his people burned his cheeks, their
hunger gnawed his breast.
The pain that ached in their hollow eyes drove
peace from his sleepless rest.
But the Jeotcr, who laus:he<l in the palace, who
mocked at the shriveled lips
Of gaunt-eyed Famine and turned aaide her
rnosn with his nimble quips.
Who rippled a stave of a reveler's song when
tt.e woman, with bitter cry,
Shrieked "Help, oh King, for God will not!" as
the helpless Kiug passed by.
The Jeater—Death laughed in his face one day
and the smile on his ilpa was chilled;
Bo strange it seemed for hlin to die, that all the
court was filled
With ripples of laughter, hushed and low, juat
tinged with pitv and shame,
But the smiles would C 'lne when thev coupled
Death with the frolicsome Jester s name.
So with pitying smiles and hands they dressed
the dead for the Court of Death.
They stripped off hi* motley—the grotesque rag«

They looked in amaze, for chaflttg his breast

Schools for the l»eaf.
A census bulletin just issued gives statistics
of public and private schools for the deaf in the
Uuited States. The average annual number ot
pupils in the public schools was 5)1 in the de
cade IS4O to IM9, 912 in the decade ISW to 1809,
1,563 in the decade 1860 to 1869, 3,159 In the de
cade 1870 to 1879, and 5,910 in the decade 188.) to
1889. The number of male pupils has always
been greater than that of females. In 1889 there
were 6,596 pupils in the public schools for the
deaf, of which 3,791 were males and 2,750 wero
females. There were fourty-three such school*,
ol which fourteen were in the North Atlantic
states, nine in the North Ceutral states, eight in
the South Atlantic states, seven in the South
Central states, and five in the Western states.
The number of pupils la privato schools In 1889
was 276, of which 135 were males and 141 fe
males. Taking only those institutions which
have made complete reports of expenditures,
the average annual cost pet pupil in the public
schools, including building and current
expenditures, was (271 in 1889, and $252 for the
decade 1880 to 18S9. The average annual cost
for the two previous decades was $256 for 1860 to
1869 aud $275 for IS7O to 1879. Tiie average an
nual cost for current expenditures, excluding
building, was for 1889 s2o<>, aad for the ten years

You see these men laughing;
The cause of their fun,
Is the wonderful work
Their Heaters have done.
Their wives chuckle too,
At the coal bills so small,
While the servant who •* fires "
Laughs loudest of all.
Everybody can laugh at cold
weather if they have a "Superior"
Furnace or Heater. They repre
sent the high-water mark of
economical heating and ventilating.
See Them,

A REAL LUXURY!I
'Looking out over the many homes of this country, we see thousaaflj
of women wearing away their lives in household drudgery that might hi
materially lessened by the use of a few cakes of SAPOLIO. If an hot*
is saved each time a cake is used, if one less wrinkle gathers upon tbeface
because the toil is lightened, she must be a foolish woman who wouH
hesitate to make the experiment, and he a churlish husband who wail
grudge the few cents which it costs.
If your grocer sends you anything in place of SAPOLIO, send it
back and insist upon having just what you ordered. SAPOLIO always
gives satisfaction. On floors, tables, and painted work it acts like i
charm. For scouring pots, pans, and metals it has no equal. Everyttaj
shines after it, and even the children delight in using it in their attempt]
to help around the house.
!W Grocers often substitute cheaper goods for SAPOLIO to make a better joi
Send back such articles and insist on having just what you ordered.
