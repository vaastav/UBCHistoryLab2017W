The President's Message to Congress.
President McKinley's soooud annual
message was submitted to CougrosB on
Monday. It le very lengthy, containing
about twenty thousand wor?-, .Tho fol
lowing is a briof synopsis of tho moro
important foaturoa of tho mosaago: It is
a history of tho war with Spain ; it ia a
fervent expression of timuka to n Divino
Powor for tho success of Amorioan
?umn; it ia an expression of a nation's
appreciation for tho horoism mid patriot
ism displayed in battlo; it urgos an in
crease of tho regular army to ono hun
dred thousand mon; it roviows our rota
tions with tho nations of tho world; it
reiterates Republican polloy ns to tho
financial question; it doos not discuss
tho Philippine problem; it doos not dis
OUSB tho mee troubles; lt does not dis
cuss tho tariff. Tho30 who havo tho
timo will no doubt bo edified and Inter

Furmau's Now llonrd of Trustees.
Tho'frionds of Furman University and

purposo to serve in thoir soloctlou, us

by tho prosont board. Thoso colleges
aro very near to thc hearts of thousands
of tho host pooplo In our Stato, who look
with conlldonco to tho trustees to foster
tho highest ofllcioncy and greatest usoful
11088 of these time honored institutions.
Wo boliovo that each and oyory member

Senator MoLnurin on I lie H nee Probien.
On our first pago will bo found an in
terview of Sonator John L, MoL-aurln, of
South Carolina, by tho Washington Post,
on tho race problem. It is a masterly
analysis of tho conditions prevailing in
tho South, and furnishes a lucid and
cogent explanation of tho causes which
lcd up to tho rccont conflicts in North
nud South Carolina. Always strong and
forceful in tho expression of his viows on
any public question, Senator McLaurin
in this instance even surpasses himself in
laying baro tho basic principles involved,
and giving to tho pooplo of tho North a
calm, true presentation of tho facts in
tho caso.
Tho Washington Post, ono of tho
greatest and most influential dailies pub
lished on tbe continent, shares his views
in tho main, and has risen above tho sen
timent of party or section in its treat
ment of the recent, troubles between tho
races in tho Sou tb.
Tho Baptist State Convention nud its
I md ii ni ions of Lcnruiug.
At tho convention at Darlington Fur
man University and tho Groonvillo Fo
malo Collcgo carno in for a largo share of
attention. Dr. A. P. Montague, tho Pre
sident of Furman University, is a manly
man, ono well prepared and lltted for tho
position to which he has been called hy
tho Baptists of tho Stato. By his genial
mannors ho has captivated tho Baptists
of tho Stato and so ingratiated himself
into tho conlldonco of his pupils that
each regards bim moro as a companion
and friend than othorwiso. They ma ko
him thoir confidential advisor and
friend. Dr. Montague's address to tho
convention in tho interest of tho work
confided to bis caro was wo\\ received by
his brethren.
A now Board of Trustees for Furman
University and tho Greenville Fomalo
College was selected, as given else where
in our columns, and this Board resolved
to exert it? best endeavors to advance
tho interests of tho colleges. Tho Board
fools that all that is necessary to tho
comploto success of tho collcgos is to
hold up tho hands of thoir ofiieers.
Wo now havo 170 pupils undor Dr.
Montaguo, and noxt year wo earnestly
hope to double this number. If tho
number of students is to bi doubled tho
college must havo moro room for their
entertainment. ,
Tho authorities havo now in contem
plation tho erection of a new building,
tho Alumni Hall. Already a considera
ble sum has been subscribed for its build
ing, but a sufficient amount for its com
pletion is not in sight. Tho eollogo au
thorities aro now petitioning tho Baptists
of tho Stato to help in this ontorpriso,
and to this omi tho junior editor of tho
COUKIKK expects, in tho near future, to
visit tho various sections of tho Beaver
dam Association and prosont tho claims
of tho college.
Tho Stato of South Carolina, now
raises for tho Stato collcgos botwoou
$125,000 and $175,000 annually to defray
tho exponaos of thoso institutions.
Thoso Stato colleges do not offer any
higher standard of learning than tho
denominational colloges, and, thoreforo,
cannot justly claim tho special favor of
support by taxation. Wo mako this
prediction: That in tho near futuro ibis
taxation must cease, or bo greatly cur
tailed.
The signs of tho times indicate that a
Conflict between tho Stato and denomi
national colleges is imminent. Tho con
troversy can, and wc think will bo, Bot

Two Pointed Questions Answered?
What is tho uso of making a hotter arti
cle than your competitor if you cannot.
get a hotter pi ico for it?
Ans. As thoro is no difference in tito
prico tho publie will buy only tho hotter,
so that while our profits may ho smaller
on a singlo salo they will ho much greater
in tho aggregate.
Dow can you get thc public to know
your make is tho best?
If both artielos aro brought promi
nently before tho publie both aro certain
to bo tried, and" tho public will vory
quickly pass judgment on thom and uso
only tho hottor ono.
This explains tho largo sale on Cham
berlain's Cough Hcmody. Thc people
