It wan tti rejnirt of Oiipi'iiI (Ikst that
finally Hntiflril out Huti.kh's lljrht. This re

several more of the ureaU'r or leaner lights
In Infamy, anions whom may l iiwiutl
two other great H'a Hanks and ItcKNAivs.
Some have ho far emiiiieil, lint it I to be
hoped tlmt tin) time of tlielr extliiKuMi-
nmnt In not fur in the future
It appears also, that Ht'Tt.F.ti, at the re
quest of Stanton, Ida eoiuM-er m wickud
tiesa, ban beeli examining the laws of trea
son and state trial fur over a century Iwiek ;
and all thiis iloillitless pn'iiaratory to the
triul of I)avih by a military commission.
What a pity to stop these worthies in so
laudable and characteristic an mnlei taking.
They evidently nntleipatcd a carnival of
blood that w ould put all of Stanton's for
mer acts of the kind entirely In tlie simile.
But the president's decision not to allow a
military commission for the, trial of Davis,
ha extinguished all their hopes In this
direction, and both tuny now devoutly ex
claim "Othello's occupation's none!"
The country will lie k1'"1 of lu 1
has eommlthil an offense against the laws,
let liliu be tried ill the manner prescrllicd
by tlie laws. The people are nick of the
bloody Roencfi which havesooften dlsgraciil
lis as a people during the last few months,
and they want no more of them. Prenl
dent Johnsons, in this dwlsioii, has acted
the part of one who Is guided by reatnn
and hunuinlty, as well as a regard for the
laws of the land, aud tlie country will ap
. plaud him for It. 1
Fanaticism.
The Cincinnati Commercial, enough
of common sense to appreciate and be dls
' gnstod with the fanaticism of Kcmnkr, ar
rives at tlie subjoined nonsensical conclu
sion as to Its effex't:
"If Mr. rlumner does not succeed in re
Btoring the Democratic party to iower, and
with It the old. iHilitical traitors of the
' South, It will not ln his fault. He Is doing
all that one man in an Influential position
can do, to bring about that result."
To which the (liicago Ttmn thus aptly
and truthfully responds: "By this Is meant
that the republican party will become
nauseated with Sumnkh's fanaticism and
malevolence. The truth is, he never has
taken a position to which the party did not
speedily advance, lie is the leader of the
party in the Senate. What lie illrects. tlie
Senate will do. What the Senate may do,
the House w ill Indorse, and what the house
Indorses, the republican press the Cota
mereial Included will commend, There
would be much more of consistency, ir not
decency, In tlie denunciations of radicals
by professed conservative republicans if
; their authors were not tlie political allies of
those whom they denounce. Spmnkk can
not present the negro to his party In a form
,, so revolting, nor attach to tlie act, coudi
tions so onerous, that it will not swallow
" him. The Commercial has given occasional
evidence of the nausea for two years past
but still it guljw him down at the bidding
of raiHualdiHitors." ' . J J

Detroit Fret Prett estimates that during
, the present season 137,500 bushels of voU-
toeshava been shipped from that city. It
says that at tho opening of the season the
prices paid did not vary far from 'JO cents
, perbushc). . Tlu y raphlly advaucud under
, tUu sllmuliis of a large deniaud, until they
reached 60 cents per busliel and upwards.
The average price paid throughout the
whole season was 45 cents per bushel. This
makes the sung silul of UU,874 mkl to the
farmers In' that market alone for Ktatoes

JACOB M. SCOTT. CINCINNATI, OHIO. December 11. 1865.
The President and Congress.
Willi reference to the power of the Pres
ident to carry out the principles of his
message In the Administration of the t!ov
erumeiit, the Albany .Inan says:
He makes theoretic recommendations,
based tiHii Constitutional law, to men who
mock at all Constitutions, ami w hose w ill
is a higher law than man's enactment or
(iod's word, lie speaks of state rights to
a Congress that had prewired tlscll to re-
eive his message, liv the uislraneliisement
if a dozen Stales, tie siH'aks of ceouoinv
lo a body of scctilatiug legislators, lie
alksnt inoderal ion ami prudence to hanks
which Issue an irredeemable paT.
lie counsels the is'Ople, to counsel earn
other to liav tiicir debts; when we have
just set all example of public indebtedness
such us no nation lias eipialleil. lie ad
vises the retrenchment ol currency in lace
of the fact that our paM-r circulation has
risen tn live years, from firn immlrcil mil
lions to anrra hundred millions, and tlie cry
is for more. He asks a Congress whose
members have liccu chosen bv the corruot
contributions of tlie protected interests, to
inoillly tlie tarill to revenue pni siscs; aim
he records the opinion "that no favored
class should demand freedom fmm assess
ment, and the taxes should be distributed
so as not to fall unduly iiKin tlie poor, but
rather iiihmi the acjuinuiiu.ci wealth ol the
country, in the face of the conureasloual
action and judicial decision which exempt
the Immense class of federal boiidliolders
from all participation in the support of
statu and municipal uuruens.
Political Sermons.
It Is not often that we see anything to
commend in political sermons. But there
Is so much of tact and common sense In
tire subjoined extract from one preached
by a clergyman in Philadelphia, on TUurs
day last, that we reproduce it by way of
contrast with those which were generally
delivered on that day
"Wo have at present thrown ukiii the
world about four millions of human beings
wlio never had any care or anxiety about
the future; and w hat is being dune to bet
ter their condition r i admit there is nnv
iiiantity of sympathy, but that neither
shelters, feeds, nor clothes these unloi'lii
natii creatures who are without friends or
homes, llicy are dying by hundreds anil
thousands, these, very unfortunate negroes
who have been cruelly and unkindly
treated in tlie wav lu which they have been
thrown iiimiii the world. If slavery 'Wax to
lie got rldof in this country if the people
had wished it, it should have been done
gradually. Their condition is deplorable
in the extreme, aud the hot breath of the
U'slilciice is sweeping over litem like tlie
sirocco of tlm desert. It is the duty of
those who brought theiii to this condition
lo provide for them, for they are mostly
that iHirtion of the American ncoiilu whose
ancestors w ere chiefly concerned in bring
ing African slaves to this country, and who
reaped immense fortunes thereby : the In
habitants of the Stales of Massachusetts
aud Uhode island should lake care of these
lH.'oplo now. '
Preston King.
The JirtirstiJ of (hmmtrec of Monday has
the following concerning the supposed sui
cide of Preston King
But two week have passed since the su-
liosed suicide, of 1'rcston King, and Hie. sad
affair seems to have nearly faded from the
uiindsol men. Could the veil be lilted anil
an insight given of the hearts of many, it
is to lie feared that to hundreds, who hoped
to prollt by his death, tlie event has been a
source ul secret ri'lolcliig. 1 he belief, how
ever, among those who think at nil upon
the sul net. Is gaining ground that Mr,
King lias not committed suicide, but has
wandered oil into some retreat of which
this city is full, where lie will yet be found
Ami while the mere fact of tlie body not
having been discovered affords no evidence
that no suicide was committed, vet In
stances are by no means iniamnnon of s r
sons supMsed to have been made away
with, voluntarily' or otherwise, re-appearing
In full lile and health. , it must bs
coufcsscil, also, Unit various reasons seem
to give color to tho aiitl-aulciOo theory.
The Klic.e are still quietly continuing their
investigations upon tills fatter supKsltioli,
and may yet Ibid tho clue that will luad to
the disentanglement this deep mystery.
Napoleon and Mexico.
It is saiil that the Kuiperor Napoleon, a
short time since, addressed alelU:r dinit
to the Secretary of rilale, inking Ktr tile1
recognition, by the llniU'iKstjites. of Maxi
milian's iiovernuient as a t lovi iiinent Ji
m to. The ground upon which he hasod
his ruett was null It had maintained ilsi-u
for nearly two ymrs, and was, therefore,
eiilitlcd to such roeognil ion. It is said that
the Secretary of Stale has. rxplicd to the
uoto, 111 w hich be oinihalicaily Ici11iips to
accede to tlie reiilesU and gives, at lengtll,
the reasons therefor, tie dmiies that it, ' is
S itovcrumcnt tie tiu tv ; that the whole peo
ple of tile l? lilted Suites are iilcilged against
any such recognition, if lliere were any
grounds for il, which there are not; that,
from the beat Information obtainable. tVom
