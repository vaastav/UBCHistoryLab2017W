The President and Secretary Bristow agree in
steadfast adherence to tho policy of returning
ie payment. Tho former is concise in
bis treatment of the subject, but tho Secretary
considers It at length, as it is eminently proper
ho should. Wo cannot, to-day, give tho full
text of his argument in favor of hard money,
but we presont what is of the greatest interest,
the proper measures to be adopt
that he recommends, and
.-o does the President, that authority bo granted
tor funding tho greenbacks in a four per cent.
, the President suggests 3 65 per
bond, at a rato not exceeding two million of dol
Iiirs per month. This is in acoord with
reoontly made by good authorities on 11
, in different parts of tho country, and it

After considering at length the advantage aud
necessity of resuming speoie payment, Secretary
Bristow's report Bays :
In furtherance of the puipose of tho act of the
last Congress to provide for the resumption of
specie payments, tho Beoretary recommends that
authority bo given for funding iogal-tender notes
bonds boaring a low rate of interest. Such
bonds should run lor a longer period of time
than thoso now authorized for.refunding tho in.
terest-beariug debt, aud should be mailo avail
able to national banks for deposit to secure their
circulation and other liabilities to tbe Govern
ment, and should bear a rato of interest so low
to cause too rapid absorption of tbe
notes. It soerns probable that a bond bearing
interest at tbe rato of four per cone, would In
vite the funding of r sufficient amount of legal
tender notes to lossen materially tho sum of gold
which, in the absence of such provision, must
be accumulated in tl.o Treasury by tbe 1st pf
January, 1879, to ci
quire munis or the act of Jan. 14tli, 1875 If it be
apprehended that authority to the Secretary to
fuurl an unlimited amount of
to too sudden contraction of tho currency, Con
groes could limit the amount to bo funded in
any given period of time. The process being in
'souse compulsory as to tho holders of United
States notes, and the rate of interest on the
bonds bedng made low it R is not probable that

BKOETVEB CANBY EXECUTES
P08E88I0N
DINATES.
William M. Cauby, appointed Receiver of the
W. «fc W. Railroad, in the U. S. Circuit Court,
yesterday, gave bond in the amount of $12,000»
and William Cauby and Edward T. Bellah
accepted as his sureties. He then took posses
sion of the road, and assumed its entire
agement, according to the order of the Court.
Notice of this is given elsewhere. Mr. Canby
made no change in the subordinate officers of
tbe road, and none is at present anticipated.
The actual reason why the proceedings taken
yesterday have now been precipitated is that
suits were in progress in the Court at Now
Castle, against the Company, one of them being
a claim for $2000. sued for by Matthew Bated,
of Philadelphia, formerly head of the Baldwin
Locomotive Works, this sum being his share of
$0000. which the Company owes that ooncern.
If these judgments had been obtained, the
enues of the road could have been attaohed,
its property seized, to satisfy them, to the prej
udice of other creditors. The application for
the appointment of a Receiver was acquiesced
in by all parties concerned, but there
preference felt on the part of some, for contin
uing Mr. Bradford, who has served for nearly
two years as President, without any compensa
tion, and has given much time and labor
to the position, in charge of the road
Receiver. Judge Bradford, however, as stated
in yesterday's report, took tho view that Mr.
Bradford's being President made it improper
that he Bhould be made Receiver, though it w
pointed
same relation to the
a member of tho Board
the stockholders.
The only difference among the road's credi
tors, thus far, is therefore in reference to the
selection of a Receiver, and all parties announce
their confidence in Mr. Oanby's integrity of pur
pose. The question, however, whether the road
shall now be forced to a sale, under the bill filed
yesterday, will probably develop a decided oppo
sition of views. Ool. H. 8. MoOomb is under
stood to be, as he was two years ago, a strong
advocate of foreclosure aud sale.

The third murder within a year in Delaware

six men, with four dogs, were gunning in Ha

by Samuel Hibbard. The dogs were frightening
tho sheep on the place, and Hibbard requested
tbe men to leave. This they refused to do, and,
words, it is said that Hibbard shot
of the dogs—a setter. One of tho gunners
then struck Hibbard with tho butt of his gun.
A fight ensued, and at this juncture it is alleged
that Sheridan interfered, and
