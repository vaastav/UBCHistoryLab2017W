LAVS, ,PHILLIPINE FREEDOM, URGED BY WILSON
;. , (By Associated Press)
7. WASHINGTON. Dec, 7. President
Wilson's annual message to congress
fet part follows:
TThea I addressed myself to per
forming the, duty laid upon the presi
dent. Dytheii constitution o present
you an annua) report on . the state of
the union, I found my thought dom
inated by an immortal sentence of
Abraham Lincoln:
"Let us have faith that, right makes
might, apd in , that .faith let us dare
to do our dutx,'a$ tve; understand It
a sentence immortal because it em
bodies in a form of utter simplicity
and purity the 'essential faith of the
ration, the faith in which it was con
ceived: and the faith and the birth of
i nation founded on it came the hope
into the world that a new order would
prevail throughout the affairs of man
It tnfi. an order in which reason and
right would take precedence of covet
ousness and force, and I believe that
1 express the wish' and purpose of
every thoughtful American when I
bald that this" sentence marks for us
in the plainest manner the part we
t-hould play alike in the arrangement
of our domestic affairs and in our
exercise of influence upon the affairs
of the world.
Faith Won War.
By this faith, and by this faith alone
can the world be lifted out of its pres
ent confusion and despair. It was this
faith which prevailed over the wicked
force of Germany. You will remember
that the beginning of the end of the
war came when the German people
themselves, face to face with the con
science of the world, and realized that
right was everywhere arrayed against
rent year. . It is obvious that thesis
large payments have already seriously
limited the government's progress in
retiring the floating debt.
Simplify Taxes,
Closely connected with this, it
enema tn trie is thp TieresKitv for an I
immediate consideration of the revi
sion of aur tax laws. Simplification of
the income and profits taxes has be
come as immediate necessity. These
taxes performed an indispensable serv
ice during the war. The need for their
simplification, however, is very great,
in order to save the taxpayer incon
venience and expense and in order
to make his liability more certain and
definite.
It is my privilege to draw to the at
tention of Congress for very sympa
thetic consideration the problem of
providing adequate facilities for the
care and treatment of former mem
bers of the military and naval forces
who are sick or disabled as the result
of their participation in the war.
The heroic men can never be paid in
money for the service they patriot
icaly rendered the nation. Their re
ward will lie rather in realization of
the fact that they vindicated the
rights of their country and aided in
safeguarding civilization. The na
tion's gratitude must be effectively re
vealed to them by the most ample
provision for; their medical care and
treatment, as well as for their voca
tional training and placement.
Complete Program.
The time has come when a more
complete program can be formulated
and more satisfactorily administered
for their treatment and training and
I earnestly urge that the Congress
the wrong that their government was: give the matter its early consideration,
attempting to perpetrate. I think, I The secretary of the treasury and
therefore, that it is true to say that the board for vocational education
this was the faith which won the war. I will outline in their annual reports
Certainly this is the faith with which I proposals covering medical care and
our gallant men went into the field
and out upon the seas to make sure
of victory.
Need of Democracy.
This is the mission upon which de
mocracy came into the world. Demo
cracy is an assertion of the right of
the Individual to live and be treated
justly, as against any attempt on the
part of any combination of individuals
to make laws which will overburden
him or which will destroy his equality
among his fellows in the matter of
right and privilege, and I think we all
Realize that the day has come when
democracy is being put upon its final
test.
There are two ways in which the
United States can assist to accom
plish this. great object: First, by of
fering the example within her own
borders of the will and power of de
mocracy to make and enforce laws
which are unquestionamly just and
which are equal in their administra
tion laws which secure the full right
of labor and yet at the same time
rafeguard the integrity of property and
particularly of that property which is
devoted to the development of indus
try and the increase of the necessary
wealth of the world. Second, by
standing for right and justice as to
wards individual nations. The law of
democracy is for the protection of the
weak, and the Influence of every de
mocracy in the world should be for
the protection of the weak nations,
the nation which is struggling toward
its right and towards its proper recog
nition -end privilege in the family of
nations.
Budget System.
Recovery from the disturbing and
sometimes disastrous effects of the
late war has been exceedingly slow on
the other side of the water, and has
given promise, 1 venture to say, of
early completion, only in our own for
tunate country. It sems to me that
the first step towards providing this
is to supply ourselves with a system
atic method of handling our estimates
and expenditures and bringing them
to the point where they will not be
an unnecessary strain upon our in
come or necessitate unreasonable tax
ation, in other words, a workable bud
get system; namely, not only that the
proposal of appropriations should be
in the hands of a single body, such as
each house of the congress but also
that 'this body should be brought into
such cooperation with the depart
ments of the government and with
the treasury of the United States as
would enable it to act upon a com
plete conspectus of the needs of the
government and the resources from
which it must draw its income.
Finances Improve.
The nation's finances have shown
marked improvement during the past
year. The total ordinary receipts of
$G.0'J 4.000,000 for the fiscal year 1020,
e xceeded tlioe for 11)19 by $1,512,000,-1
000, while the total net ordinary ex
penditures decreased from $1S, 51 1,000,-
000 to $6,403,000,000. The gross public
flobt, which reached its highest point'
on August. 21, 1919, when it was $26,
596,000,000, had dropped on November
;.0, 1920, to $M,173,000.0S0. There has
also been a marked decrease in hold
ings of government securities by the
banking institutions of the country as
well as in the amount resrves held by
the federal reserve banks secured by
government war obligations. This
fortunate result has relieved the banks
and left them freer to finance the
needs of agriculture, industry and
commerce. It has been due in large
part, to the reduction of the public
debt, specially of the floating debt,
but more particularly to the improved
distribution of government securities
among permanent investors.
Economy Necessary.
T cannot over-emphasize the neces
sity of economy in government ap
propriations and expenditures and the
rvoidance by the congress of practices
which take money from the treasury
by indefinite or revolving fund ap
propriations. The estimates for the
present year show that over a billion
dollars of expenditures were author
ized by the "last congress, in addition
to the amounts shown in the usual
compiled statements of appropriations.
This strikingly illustrates the Im
portance of making direct and specific
appropriations. . The relation between
1 he, current receipts and current ex
penditures of the government during
the present fiscal year, as well as dur
ing the last half of the last fiscal year,
has been disturbed by the extraordin
ary burdens thrown upon the treasury
by the transportation act, in connec
tion with the return of the rauroaas
to nrlvate control. Over $600,000,000
has already been paid to the railroads
under this act $350,000,000 during me
present flscol year; and it is estimated
that" further payments aggregating
imssibly $650,000,000 must still be
mfde to the railroads during the cur-
lusion had ben made, they had proved
to be unsuccessful and the city had
not been injured. ,
Mr. Reller said he was not in favor
of delay.
"The firms that have been accused
of crooked dealing have not been able
to carry this through, and they are
not to receive the bids. If we put the
matter off longer there is little doubt
but that we will be severely criti
cised," Mr. Reller stated.
Council Favors Progress.
All the councilmen then arose in or
der and expressed their opinion on
the matter, all of them agreeing lhat
since Mr. Reller's presentation of the
problem it seemed that the best thing
to do was to go ahead.
The first two readings of the ordi
nance allowing the city to borrow
$100,000 during the next year in antici
pation of current expenses of the Mu
nicipal Light plant was passed on the
recommendation of Mr. Perk, expert
accountant of the city. This money
will be used to pay back money spent
in 1920 for additions and betterments,
being borrowed only as needed, and re
turned out of the revenues of the plant
Lack of Civic Interest
Scored by Prof. Lindley
Lack of interest on the part of re
sponsible citizens was given as the
cause of present conditions in city af
fairs, by Professor Harlow Lindley, of
Earlham college, speaking before the
Rotary club at their weekly luncheon,
Tuesday noon. People can get any
thing they want if they take the in
terest and work hard enough for it,
was the opinion of the speaker.
"The breakdown of the municipal
government of the cities of the United
States has been the one thing criti
cized by those capable of criticizing,"
said Mr. Lindley. "The democracy of
our federal government is a matter of
pride and its success is a marvel by
students of government, but the appli
cation of the principles to cities has
failed."!
Home rule means only the freedom
of a city to manage its own affairs.
A city is a business proposition, but

of the club under the classification of

ASKS FOR EXPLANATION.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. Secretary
Baker was asked today by the house
military committee to appear before
it Friday and explain why the war
department has recruited an army ol
more than 190,000 men.
were referred to committees.
rehabilitation which I am sure will
engage your earnest study and com
mand your most generous support.
It would also be most serviceable
if it were provided that all goods re
leased from cold storage for interstate j
shipment should have plainly marked
upon each package the selling or,
market price at which they went into;
storage in order that the purchaser ;
might be able to learn what profits
stood between him and the producer
or the wholesale dealer. Indeed, it i
would be very serviceable to the pub-!
lie if all goods destined for interstate j
commerce were made to carry on j
every packing case whose form made ;
it possible, a plain statement of the j
price at which they left the hands of ,
the producer. I respectfully call your
attention to the recommendation of
the message referred to with regard to
a federal license for all corporations
engaged in interstate commerce.
Suggests Loan.
In response to what I believe to be
impulse of sympathy and opinion
throughout the United States, I earn
estly suggest that the congress author
ize the treasury c" he United States
to make to the stiuggling government
of Armenia such a loan as was made
to several of the allied governments
during the war.
Allow me to call your attention to
the fact that the people of the Phil
lipine Islands have succeeded in main
taining a stable government since the
last action of congress in their behalf,
and have thus fulfilled the condition
set by the congress as precedents to
a consideration of granting independ
ence to the islands. I respectfully
submit that this precedent having
been fulfilled it is now our liberty and
our duty to keep our promise to the
people of those islands by granting
them the independence which they so
honorably covet.
I have not so much laid before you
a series of recommendations, gentle
men, as sought to utter a confession of
faith, of the faith In which I was bred,
and which it is my solemn purpose to
stand by until my last fighting day.
I believe this to be the faith of Amer
ica, the faith of the future, and of all
the victories which await national
action in the days to come, whether In
America or elsewhere.
Mrs. Johnson Discusses the
Influence of Rubens
The influence of Rubens on 18th
centurp painting in France was the
subject of an interesting talk given
by Mrs. Charles M. Woodman before
the Art department of the Woman's
club when it met in the Public Art
Gallery Tuesday morning. Miss Mar
tha Doan gave an excellent talk on
the spirit of the return to nature
which pervaded the art of the time of
Louis XV.
The paintings of the Rococo period
were discussed by Mrs. M. F. John
son and slides of the pictures of that
time by different artists were shown
to illustrate her discussion and comparisons.

dent of this city nearly all his life.

COUNCIL SAYS BOARD
MUST LET CONTRACT
FOR EQUIPMENT NOW
City council voted unanimously that
the board of works proceed at once
with letting of the contract for the
5,000 k. w. turbine for the municipal
light plant, Monday night.
Several councilmen were prepared
to urge the rejection of all bids. This
attitude was voiced by Councilman
Ford soon after the meeting opened.
"The best thing this council can do
is to urge the board to rescind all bids
in order to get some fair and square
bids. From the reports current some
body has tried to put something over
on the city, loot's drop all bids and
come in on a new deal, Mr. Ford de
clared. "We are standing between citizens
and concerns who are trying to get an
extra dollar. We should go on record
as being in favor of wiping out the
whole thing and start over."
Reller Explains.
This expression brought several
councilmen to their feet, but Mayor
Zimmerman gave the floor to City At
torney Reller, who explained the con
ference of the board of works and
bidders for the turbine Monday after
noon. He said charges had been made by
some bidders, and these had been com
municated to tbe mayor and city at
torney. After discussing the matter,
the two city offcials decided to call a
conference of the board council, citi
zens commitee, and interested individ
uals. Mr. Reller said if efforts of col-
