THE OM.ATIA DAILY HEE: THURSDAY, DKCEM1J13R in, 1901.
t;ook establishes (ho fuct that the official
(j)mrta with which the flagship Brooklyn
was supplied and upon whuh L'ommiiilorn
Hclilcy wna compelled to icly f"r Informa
tion showed coaling ut tape Cruz to ho
neither feasible nor practicable, nnd the
records clearly show that not until the 27th
of. May, three days nfter leaving Clenfue
Kos, when 'nptnln Clmrlrs S. Cotton visited
tho flagship Urooklyn, illd Commodore,
HCliloy receive (Uiy ilullnltc information
concerning tho fenlhlllty or priirtlcahlllty
of coullng his ships from 11 collier In clo
nal ves channel, all of which fads have been
wholly Ignored hy the mujorlty of the
court In formulating Its said report of facts.
1Z. The m.ijorlty of the court In stntln,?
In lt! report of facts that Commodore:
Hohley received no positive Information
from the scoutMilpn as to the presence of
the enomy's licet In the harbor of San
tiago utterly Ignores the overwhelming
testimony In proof of the fact thnt Cap
tuln C, D. Hlgsboo did actually report to
Commodore Schley and to others that tho
Hpanlsh licet wna not in the harbor of
Santiago.
13. 'the opinion of the majority of the
court and thy report of facts Is entirely
silent on the subject of the proven mid
admitted failure of Captains Wise and
Jawull to communicate the Information
they had received In reference to the pres
ence of the .Spanish fleet In the harbor of
Santiago to Commodore Schley.
It. That tho report of facts submitted
by the court stales. that tho condition of
wind, sea and weather from noon on May
1'iJ-to June 1 were favorable for taking
cool from a collier at sen off Santiago,
when this statement has been directly
controverted by tho evidence of tho wit
nesses for the, government.
Experts' Tit bleu Lf-rt Out.
15. Tho tables prepared by government
exports and udmltted In evidence beroru
the -court showing the coal supply of tho
vessels of the Hying siiuadron, with refer
ence to (heir chasing cupaelty, proceeding
ut full speed with forced draught, huvo
not even been adverted to li tho report of
fuels.
16. There has not been tho slightest ref
erence made by the mujorlty of the court
to the orders of tho honorable secretary
of the nuvy, offered and proved In evi
dence forbidding tho hazarding of Amer
ican ships against a shoro battery, and
the court has decided against tho appli
cant on tho seventh spcclllcntluu of tho
precept without In the slightest degree re
ferring to this Important evidence. ,
17. The majority of tho court bus entirely
fulled to give any opinion as to tho char
acter of blockude of Santiago, ulthough
the samo was Included In tho eighth
upcclncatlon of tho precept and by specific
direction the court wus obligated to give
, un opinion thereupon,
At Variance ultli Orders,
18. Th'n mnjorlty opinion of tho court, that
Commodore Schley should have endeavored
to capturu or destroy tho Spanish vessels
ut anchor near the entrance of Santiago
harbor on May 9 and 3", and that ho did
not do his utmost with tho force under
his command to capture or destroy
Colon and other vessels of tho enemy on
May 31, Is wholly at varlonco with the
utueis tuiiuui nuii'ii oiiiiiimiimi e nuincj wtin
ucuut; ouio.i- nuiiiuiKu, sum unirip no in
attested by No. 8, dated May '.'I, lS'J', anil
bent by Admiral Sampson to Commodore
Hchley, restricting hi operations to the
establishment and malntt nance of u block
udo of the port of Santiago If tho enemy
should bu found therein, and also said
opinion Is uttirly and ubnlutcly at varl
unco with the overwhelming weight of
testimony which clearly established the
. fact that tho affair of May 31 was pre
determined upon and executed as a re
connolsaunco uud not us u formal uttack
upon the Spanish vessels nor upon tho land
batteries ut tho entrance to the harbor of
Bantlugo.
Opinion In Anililtctionn.
19. The majority opinion of tho court lo
ambiguous and Indeterminate. In that the
court holds tho turn of Urooklyn to star
board was made to avoid getting It into
dangerous proximity to tho Spanish ves
sels, without stating whether evasion of
bitch datmerous proximity was duo to the
personal fears of Commodore Schley or to a
desire on his part to preserve tho ship
Intuct and ready for further work In tho
effort to win a victory from the enemy.
20. The majority of tho court has en
tirely Ignored tho overwhelming 'estlmony
submitted In tho case in arriving at tho
opinion that Commodore Schley erred In
commencing the engagement on Julv 3,
with tho port battery, tho evidence In tho
case clearly establlxliing tho fuct that in
the execution of tho standing order to
'clone In and attack In harbor ontrace,"
It was possible lor Urooklyn, without turn
ing uway from thu enemy, to open the
engagement except with Its port battery,
und the evidence also clearly established
tho fuct that the turning of Urooklyn In
the manner and 'direction in which it did
turn did not ciiune it to lose either dis
tance nor position with tho Spanish ves
sels, tho contrary opinion of tho court upon
this subject being arrived ut only by dis
regarding all of the evidence offered in
behalf of Commodore Schloy.
I'roof Is Overwhelming:,
21. Tho majority opinion of the court is
ambiguous and Indeterminate In that whllo
stating that Brooklyn's turning caused
T.exan to stop und "to back Its engines
to avoid possible collision" said opinion
does not stute whether tho danger or such
collision, as apprehended by tho ninth
specification of' tho precept, wuh real or
Imaginary, whereas tho overwhelming
weight ot testimony clearly established tho
fuct that lit no tlmo was (hero danger of a
collision between Urooklyn und Texas.
22. Tho testimony df Captain l 1-2. Cook,
u witness' called by tho judge advocato in
relerence to tho proximity of Urooklyn
to Texus at tho tlmt) of Urooklyn a
turning hus been Ignored and not even re
ferred to In tho spcclllcutlon of tacts.
23. The majority of tho court has assumed
that tho testimony of Lieutenant Com
mander A. C. Hodgson, notwithstanding
Its repeated contradiction In reference to
tho alleged conversation regarding tho
proximity of Texas nt tho tlmo of
Urooklyn'n turning. Is true nnd has entirely
Ignotvd tho teiitimony of Commodore Schley
and Captain V. Ii. Cook to tho contrary,
without oven referring to it in their state
ment of pertinent facts.
Nut JiiNtlfloil by Knots.
24. The mnjorlty opinion of tho court that
Commodoro Schley's conduct In connection
with tho events of tho Santiago campaign,
prior to June i; 1S9X, was characterized by
vacillation, dllatorluess und lark of enter
prise, Is In no wlso Justified by tho evidence
submitted In the caso nnd could only huvo
been arrived nt by tho action of tho court
in wholly Ignoring all of tho evidence of
Commodoro Schley, all of tho evidence of
witnesses summoned In his behalf and all
that portion of tho ovldenco of witnesses
called hy tho Judge advocate which was
fuornhlo lo the said Commodore Schloy.
26. Tim mnjorlty opinion of tho court Is
conclusive in that It is entirely silent upon
a charge preferred by tho Judge nilvocnto
during tliH course of tho publlo Investiga
tion and claimed by him (o cnino within tho
purview of thn first specification, to-wlt:
That the said Commodoro Schley wnB dere
lict in tho discharge of his duty and un
mindful of tho regulations for tho govern
ment of tho navy of the United States, In
that ho did nit prescrlbo and promulgate
anticipatory orders of buttle.
Who AViin In ConiniMiid.
26. Thn majority of tho court has en
tirely fulled to determine as to who was In
command of tho American naval forces en
gutted In tho buttle, of Santiago, the finding
of which fact was absolutely necesonry In
order to determine properly th tlrst speci
fication of tho precept as to tho conduct
of Commodoro Schley In connection with
the events of tho Santiago campaign.
27. Tho majority of tho court has re
jected thn wholo of thn testimony offered
on behalf of thu applicant and hus not
adverted to such testimony and has en
tirely Ignored tho testimony of tho 'in.
pllcnnt himself, who was on tho stand for
many nours ami sunjiicteii to mo most
searching examination, nml by so doing
they huve perverted tho ends of Justlc".
That If this testimony wns all false tbey
should huvo ho announced uhd if all or
any part of it was true tho said applicant
wus entitled to the benefits of It, and by
declining to consider or pass upon it thny
huvo deprived him of his common law and
constitutional rights.

lions which wore substantially abandoned

tho ui'Kiiincnt in the caso.
29, That tho whole proceedings show that

nnd upon that testimony huvo bused the

Applicant i I'l cpitreil.
31. The applicant Is prepared to show
that the whole proceedings on the part of
tho majority of tho court has lieen en
tirely Irregular; that his rights have been
prejudiced tttid Ignored; that his testimony
In many more particulars than have been
herein cited tins not been considered, nnd
that the evidence Is absolutely lnsulllclent
to sustain the opinion which has been ren
dered by the mnjorlty of thn court; that
a grave Injustice has been committed,
which would become Irreparable and be
Perpetuated unless this onlriloh of the ma
jority of the coJrt Hhoutd be disapproved.
Wherefore, Tho said applicant most re
spectfully prnyi that approval or the

forded the opportunity lo have tho testi

he be. given such other and further relief

Call" Verdict ApiiiiIMiib:.
Commenting on today's action, Mr. Hayner
snld-
The objections we hnvo (lied rest upon
tho uround that Admiral Schley has been
deprived of his rights ns guaranteed to
him !) the law of tho land and tho con
stitution of his country. Wo claim tint
tho whole of tho evidence In favor of tho
admiral, Including Idi own uud tho testi
mony of all of his witnesses, has been re
jected by tho mnjorlty of tho court and
not even considered or passed upon. Such
a method of proceedurc would not bo per
muted to stand tor a moment iiuroro any
tribunal governed by any principle of com
mon law or common Justice. 'Iho admiral
was on the stand for ubout four days and
not il word that ho uttered nnd not a
solemn assertion thnt ho rnudo under tho
sanction of his outh hns been adverted to
by the tnajorl'y ot tlio court, hucn n
method of dlsnoslnu of n cuso Is unnrecc-
dented In tho annuls of criminal lnw. The
greatest malefactor in tlic land, under t lie
constitution, Is entltlt-d to have his evidence
considered and passed upon.
V shall, therefore, avail ourselves of
every remedy that wo huvo to impeach this
uppuiiing verdict.

entirely Ignorant of four years ago. Wo
havo witnessed the epectnelo of an Amer

quering a people struggling for Indopcnd

nppurently forgetful thnt this nation was
established as n protest against the power
of ntte people to tax permanently another
people, declaring congress exempt from
the constitutional limitation upon tho great
central power of tnxntlon, and thus open
Ing tho way for autocratic government and
for tim exploitation of subject peoples.

We seen our permanent standing army

approach that of the most nrmy-rldden na
tions of IJurope. We hnvo seen ourselves
tuko a position highly inconsistent with
Justice, with tho Monroe doctrine, when
demanding that the governments of the
overcrowd'-d eastern continent shall keep
their hands oft thlH hemisphere, wo our
selves, with hundreds of millions of un

I believe now. n 1 have always believed,
when our citntnisMnncrs set their hnnd to
the treaty annexing the Philippines they
Inaugurated ns fatuous a policy as any
upon which a greut nation embarked. It
wns a policy which has been followed hy
tho destruction, by us of tens of thousands
of Intiociiit brown men who had never
done us any harm and who were lured by
our owl gloi'lo'ix history to light for their
freedom and their homes. It huh ii policy,
too, a a result of which thousands upon
thousands nf the soldiers of American
mothers will sleep their hist sleep upon
the banks of the Hlo Grande and tho
PuOlg. I know It Is said that tt will glvo

appears today to have reached tho mag
nificent proportions of Iho trade of a corner

I believe our national honor, the preserva

Hons, our peace and safety, every dlct.ito
of Intertst nnd Justice demand that we

After a few remarks by Mr. Greene of
Pennsylvania in opposition to tho bill, Mr.
McClellan of New York closed tho debate
for his side.
The acquisition of tho Phlllpplno Islands,
Ho snld, wns the most costly plunge ever
mado by n reckless gambler at tho Mnnto
Carlo of International politics. Ho ndded:
Vnllr Inultflrmtlntl for oinlliirklllL' t Ii In

was that it would open new mar
kets for American products. And
now, despite jour solemn promises, you
promlro by this hill to (lose tho markets
or tno riniippincn to tin? peopie oi un
united Stuteu. As long ns you keep up
tho burs of protection uud forbid the
Filipinos to trade with lis. Just so long
will they remain our enemies. If they
cannot sell to us, they will not buy front,
us, und If thOy cannot trade with us, their
sjmpr. tides will follow their Interests. If
you tear down the barbarous restrictions
of u protective tariff between different
parts of our territory, you will not only
open markets for American products, but
by permitting the Filipinos to prosper
you will begin the work of paclllratlon
and of lifting thuni for self-government.
1 1ll 1 7.1-1 1 CIllMI'N IH'tllltl'.
The debate wns closed by Mr. Datzcll of
Pennsylvnnln In n speech of un hour. Ho
drew n parullel between the government of
tho iAUlrilana territory Immediately after
Its acquisition nnd the government of the
Philippines to show that the latter was less
nrbllrary ami despotic than the former.
Ho commended to thoso on the other sldo
who woro zenous of the rights of the "llt
tlo brown man" Ir. the Philippines the pro
tection ot tho rlghtB of tho black men In
tho south.
"ThU measure purports to bo n revenue
bill." Interrupted Mr. McDermott of New
Jersey, "can ho cite nny net which imposed
u duly upon goods from ono territory or
stnto to another?"
"Certainly," replied Mr. Dalzell, "If tho
gentleman will exnmlno history ho will find
that duties wero levied for a long tlmo on
goods from tho territory of Louisiana and
also of Florida." (Republican applnuse,
followed by laughter ns Mr. Mann of Illi
nois called out to Mr. McDermott, "Oo
'way back nnd sit down.")
Admit (he .Minority.
"I mean nn oct of congress," persisted
Mr. McDermott. "Ho cannot cito mo to nuy
net of congress, because there Is none."
Mr. Dalzell declined to bo Interrupted
further.
Mr. Dalzell taunted tho other side with
their Inability to present anything ns n sub
stitute for tho. pending bill. Ho snld they
deslr'od to' mako their' protest ns ineffectual
us possible. '
In conclusion he declared thnt to turn the
Islands over to the Filipinos would bo to
make them tho prey of somo buccaneor
country; to put them up nt auction would
bo dishonor. ."V. rather Indulge- tho belief
and hope," said ho, "that traveling along
our traditional historic lines, we shall go
forward to the Chrlstlanlzatlon and civiliza
tion of these islands ot tho sea until wo
shall establish thcro tho principles of civil
and religious liberty." (Republican ap
plause.) ltloliiirdNon'N l'lnnl Effort.
Mr. Richardson, tho minority leader,
moved to recommit tho bill with the follow
ing Instructions:
To report a 'bill 'reducing tho tariff laws
nnd Internal rovenuo Inws now In forco lu
other portions of tho United States to u
icvenuo basis, and to apply tlio sumo to
all portions of thu United States, including
the Philippine islands, to. bu In effect until

ipinos permitted, with tho ntd of the
United States, to establish u stable nod In

Tho motion to recommit wna lost 122 to

tho republicans wero concorned, but thero
wero ll.reo votes against tho motion from
tho democratic sldo cast by Messrs. Mrous

Mr, Meyer of I oulslann was paired against
tho motion with Mr. Fotcr, democrat of

against tho motion to recommit voted for
tho bill, and flvo republicans McCall of
