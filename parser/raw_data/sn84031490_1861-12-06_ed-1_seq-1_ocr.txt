Address “ CHICAGO TRIBCSE,” Chicago, HI.
Stilt STriimu,
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 0, 1881,
On tlic same day of its delivery,
‘he Message of President Lincoln was tele
graphed to all parts of tlie loyal States.
The Message contains seven thousand five
hundred and seventy-eight words.
CST“ The Beaufort negroes are picking
cotton for the Government at three cents
per pound, so a dispatch says. We arc
making 'progress in the settlement of the
darkest side of our present troubles.
, CST" Preparations arc making for estab
lishing a machine-shop on the "sacred
soil” of South Carolina, at Port Royal.
Think of the clash of machinery and the
■presence of greasy Yankee mechanics on
■lhe sacred soil of South Carolina,
Parson Brownlow has, it would ap
pear from the dispatches, smote Ms ene
mies and those of the Government, “ Mp
mid thigh.” and given a rapid motion of
Jho.se parts of the human system to the
rebels who could get away. "We hope it
may be all the telegraph reports.
E3P From Tennessee there is every evi
dence of a bad scare, both, endemic and
epidemic, in that part of Secessia. Let ns
hope it i? not without reason, and that that
cnarter of Dixie is not to be disappointed
in its evident expectations, nor defrauded
c-f its equally evident deserts. Our Bel
mont prisoners now at Memphis arc to be
ixclumgcei
Cif It is gratifying to note that notliing
from New York contradicts tlic clieerimr
news of tlie political decease of Fernando
"Wood, on Tuesday last. By this time, if
ever, “amended returns/’ the old dodge of
New York politicians of Wood's school,
v have turned the scale in his favor.
As it stands, George Opdyke secures hon
esty and integrity to the New York Mayor
alty, and. Fernando is dead wood cut away.
C-fT The report concerning Col. Kerri
gan, and his sentence of death said to have
1 ’K‘n passed upon him by a court-martial,
turns out as we have before stated. He
has not yet been tried; and when he is
Srk-d, the offenses laid at his door, though
cisgracingto him, will not be such as would
call for the punishment of death. He was
originally put under arrest in October, for
gr insulting his superior officer, Gen.
Karlindalc, on parole.
Gf" As to the question of excluding
slave? of rebels from the Federal lines, let
the point be put thus: Suppose the regi
ment of several hundred blacks, lately re
viewed at New Orleans, were to present
themselves to Gen. Sherman, or to Gen.
Ilalleck himself, one of these davs. when
he gets further south, would either of these
officers, or any higher authority at' Was
hington, turn these colored men back to
llitir masters. And yet, how docs it differ
in principle from lesser cases constantly
occurring ?
t if Our St. Louis dispatches givendthing
of special importance in relation to the
situation in Missouri, which is the best de-
Lial of a bogus Cairo rumor, that created
f-'-ine excitement here yesterday afternoon,
relative to Montgomery and Sigel. The
great Hegira continues, and St. Louis citi
zens are working nobly for the relief of the
unhappy refugees. Gen. Hallcck is getting
well down to the work, and win put
the screws to Trusten Polk. At last the
S‘. Louis secessionists arc to be made
pM-fnl, if not ornamental, to the Govern
ment. It is to be hoped that whatever au
thority is responsible for the “ Tliird Or
der, *’ may speedily revoke it, which seems
to be all that is needed just now in Gen.
Hulleck’s Department. Indeed, applying
the order of Secretary Seward, to St. Lotus,
*hc Third Order is virtually abrogated
11; iW.
THE LIGHT BREAKING.
The two orders emanating respectively
from the Departments of Slate and Treas
ury. given in another column, demonstrate
two things. One is that a fugitive from a
nl *ol muster is no more to be arrested on
the Potomac. He is to be set at work, or
?<• is free. By the second it is' evident that
M laM the Government is about to makeone
raid trash the other. The rules are specifi
cally and dearly laid down by Secretary
Chase for the employment of means to con
vert rebel properly and crops to the uses
t f -lie Government, and at this the slaves
c f : e’>cl masters are to be set to work, un
der special government agents. Let the
fj lends of Freedom thank God, and take
courage.
FBOH WASHINGTON
Congress lias adjourned over until Mon
day, leaving, as the result of its first week’s
voik. abundant and teeming proofs that
Ihe atmosphere of Washington is clear
ft- m till hindrances to bold words and
c.jK.-xi dealing with the monster evil
{•lavciT. The documentary history of the
f- w days past opens a new era. The
c.uestion raised in the Douse as to the ex
istence and extent of censorship on the
1 re-s and telegraph, shows that our legisla
tori- are disposed to jealously watch all
cheeks and hindrances in the avenues by
which their utterances and deeds will
reach the people. Mr. Trumbull has made
a masterly speech on the great question of
Ihe day. There is a prospect of a speedy
exchange of prisoners.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF
THE NAVY',
The Report of Secretary "Welles, the
main points of ■which we give in another
column, is a plain, straightforward docu
ment, doing little more than narrating the
progress made by the Department under his
charge since July last. It discusses few
questions and makes few recommenda
tions; scarcely utters a complaint, and only
cnee makes use of strong language respect
ing the rebels. The Secretary makes no
recommendations as to the great lakes, but
Sluteg that he has been desired to call alien
lion to the magnitude of our interests in
that quarter. The estimates presented at
the Extra Session, it is found, are sixteen
and a half millions of dollars short of the
expenses already incurred. The estimates
for the ensuing year amount to $44,025,005
for all purpose.
ENLARGE9UNT OP THE ILLINOIS
AND JUCHItIJi CANAL.
"Wc arc glad to be able to state that some
thing definite and tangible is likely to be
tunic in regard to the enlargement of the
Illinois and Michigan CanaL It is propos
ed by several of our leading citizens to
make a survey of the Summit and the Illinois
smd Des Plaines rivers down to Otta
wa, at once, audit is believed that sufficient
data can be Laid before Congress early in
January to warrant their action upon the
subject The lime required for the recon
noissancc, is not large and a subscription
was started yesterday, headed by Hon.
'Wm. B. Ogden, to pay for the survey. It
will be presented to-day and to-morrow to
our leading merchants and business men,
and it is hoped the amount neccssaiy will
he promptly subscribed. A matter of so
much importance to the health and the pros
perity of the city and to the commerce and
Ihc military necessities of the Northwest,
and, in fact, to the entire Union, ought lo
receive the prompt and the energetic sup
port of every man in Chicago.

INCREASE OF THE EFFICIENCY
OF THE NAVY,
TOUT TO DO TOTH THE COSTBABAXDS.
“ Employ Them, or let Them Go.”
Wo append Ihc chief portions and features
of the Report of the Secretary ot the Navy.
The portions omitted discuss topics in which
the following are substantially the facts
stated:
No selling vessels have been ordered to he
built, for steam, as well as heaw ordnance,
hag become an indispensable element of the
most efficient naval power.
Eleven thousand mechanics and laborers
have be en in the dailv cinplov of the Govern
ment at the different navy yards, in building
and preparing vessels, and equipping and arm
ing them for service; but tills Large force has
been unable to dispatch the work with the
rapidity demanded, and the Department has
been compelled in consequence to resort to'
private shipyards and outside labor.
There have been appointed from the com
mercial marine twenty-five acting volunteer
lieutenants, four hundred and thirty-three act
ing masters, and two hundred and nine mas
ters’ mates; also further appointments of act
ing assistant-paymasters, of whom there arc
now sixty-one on duty. Actingappointmems
of engineers and assistant engineers and of as
sistant surgeons have neces»*rilv been made,
in addition to the regular corps to meet the
new and extraordinary demands of the ser
vice. There has been an aggregate of nine
hundred and iilucty-thrceaclingappointnients
lor temporary serv ice made by the Department
since the present difficulties commenced.
Orders were given in April and Mav to en
list 1,102 additional non-commissioned'otiieers
and privates in the Marine corps to meet the
requirements of the service. A general re
turn shows the actual strength of the corps,
ashore and alloat, to have been at that lime
two thousand nine hundred and sixty-four.
SINKING VESSELS.
One method of blockading the ports of the
insurgent States,andintcrdicting communica
tion as well as to prevent the egress of priva
teers which sought to depredate on our com
merce, Las been that of sinking in ihe chan
nels vessels laden with stone. The first move
ment in this direction was on the North Caro
lina coast, where there arc numerous inlets to
.Albemarle and Pamlico sounds, and other In
terior waters, which afforded facilities for
eluding the blockade, and also to the priva
teers. For this purpose a chiss of small ves
sels were purchased in Baltimore, some of
which have been placed in Ocracoke inlet.
Another and larger description of vessels
were bought in thdEastern market, most of
them snob as were formerly employed in the
whale fisheries. These were sent to obstruct
the channels of Charleston harbor and the
Savannah river; and this, if effectually done,
will prove the most economical and satisfac
tory method of Interdicting commerce at
those points.
VESSELS CAPTURED.
Since The Institution of the blockade one
hundred and fifty-three vessels have been cap
tured sailing under various flags, most of
which were attempting to violate the block
ade. With few exceptions, these vessels were
in such condition, when seized, as to author
ize their being sent at once to the courts for
adjudication and condemnation as prizes.
Appended to this report is u list of the ves
sels which have been captured.
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.
A naval force, auxiliary to and connected
with the army movements on the Mississippi
and its tributaries, has been organized, and is
under the command of Flag Officer Andrew
H. Foote, who is rendering efficient sendee iu
that quarter.
The steamers which have been built or pur
chased for this service by the War Depart
ment arc of a formidable” character, and man
ned by a class of superior seamen and West
ern boatmen, who, in the preliminary skir
mishes already, have done good service, and
will, I am confident, acquit themselves with
credit in the future. Reports arc appended
exhibiting some of the operations of this
command* as auxiliary to the military move
ments ou the Mississippi.
PURSUIT OF PRIVATEERS.
It was natural that apprehensions should
prevail in regard to armed cruisers commis
sioned expressly by the rebel leaders to dep
redate upon our commerce. The robbery of
merchants and others engaged In pcaceful and
lawful pursuits by piratical cruisers is not in
consistent with the general conduct of those
who have violated law and moral obligations
to gratify inordinate ambition. Our extended
commerce presented inducements for piratical
warfare, yet bur few of ourmisguidod country
men have prostituted themselves to the pur
poses of plunder, though thereto invited, and
t hesc few have I seen in constant flight to escape
the avenging power of our vigilant naval for
ces. Such "of these cruisers "as eluded the
blockade and capture were soon wrecked,
beached or sunk, with the exception of one,
the steamer Sumter, which, by some fatality,
was permitted to pass the Brooklyn,then block
ading one of the passes of the Mississippi, and
after a brief and feeble eliasc by the latter, was
allowed to proceed on her piratical voyage.
An investigation of this whole occurrence was
ordered by the Department. Soon the Niagara
and the Powhatan, from the Gulf squadron,
followed in vigorous pursuit—the latter,
though long in commission, and with defective
boilers and machinery, under her energetic
commander, tracking the piratical craft as far
as Mamnham. The Keystone State, Rich
mond. Iroquois and San Jacinto were also In
search of her at diifcreut points and periods.
Although a piratical rover, without license
from any recognized or acknowledged govern
ment, and avowedly engaged in The robbery
and plunder of our citizens, I regret to say
this vessel has been received, and her wants
supplied, against the remonstrance of our con
suls, by public authorities, in many foreign
pens where her character was well known.
REBEL EMISSARIES.
Captain Charles Wilkes, in command of the
San Jacinto, while searching in the West In
dies for tin* Sumter, received information that
James M. Mason and John Slidell, disloyal
citizens and leading conspirators, were with
their suite to embark from Havana in the Eng
lish steamer Trent, on their way to Europe io
promote the can-eof tlie insurgents. Cruis
ing in the Bahama Channel, lie intercepted the
Trent on the Sth of November, and took from
her these dangerous men, whom he brought
to the United States. His vessel having been
ordered to refit for service at Charlestown, the
prisoners were retained on board and conveyed
to Fort Warren, where they were committed
to the custody of Col. Dimmick, in command
of t hut fortress.
The prompt and decisive action of Captain
Wilkes on this occasion merited and received
the emphatic approval of the Department, and
if a too generous forbearance was exhibited bv
him in not capturing the vessel which had
these rebel emissaries on board, it may, in
view of the special circumstances, and of its
patriotic motives, be excused; but it must by
no means be permitted to constitute a precedent
hereafter for the treatment of any ease of similar
infraction of neutral obligations by foreign t-es
nisciigoycd in commerce or the carrying trade.
THE NAVAL FORCE AND ITS INCREASE.
This brief review of the principal opera
tions of the navy, under the new and extraor
dinary demands that were made upon its effi
ciency, naturally introduces an exposition of
the measures adopted in conformity with the
legislative policy of Congress to increase Us
available force. The measures which were
adopted by the Department in advance of the
special session in July, for augmenting the
navy, and the recommendations and sugges
tions yimh I had the honor at that time to
submit, received the sanction and approval of
Congress. Immediate action had been ren
dered necessary in consequence of events
that had been precipitated upon the country,
and for which no legislative provision had
been made. Only a feeble force of men aud
vessels, scarcely sufficient for ordinary police
operations, was at that time available on the
Atlantic coast. In order that the condition
of the navy ou the 4th of March may be right
ly understood, it will be well to state the "po
sition and character of each of the vessels at
that date. The home squadron consisted of
twelve vessels, and of these only four were in
Northern ports and available for service, viz;
Name. Class. No. of guns. Where station'd.

The following have not yet amved; To the patriotic officers of the navy, and
from east INDIES, : the brave men who, in various scenes of naval
action, have served under them, the Depart
ment and the Government justly owe an ac
knowledgment even more earnest and em

and devotion to the cause of their country,
have been the general and noble characteris

trusted. 1 state with all confidence that in
their hands the historic renown of the Ameri
can navy has been elevated and augmented.
In this convulsive crisis of our country the
duties of this Department have been new and
heavy, and its responsibilities great. I have
met them all with entire honesty of pur
pose, and have labored assiduously and faith
fully to discharge them. The result of my
labors I respectfully submit to you, and
through you to the judgment of Congress and
the country.

was 7,500. The number is now not less than
22,000.
ARMORED SHIPS.
To cany Into effect the provisions of the act
approved Aug. 3,1601, providing for the con
struction of one or more armored ships and
floating batteries, I appointed Commodores
Joseph Smith and Hiram Paulding, and Capt.
Chalice- 13. Davis, skillful ami experienced
naval officers, to investigate the plans and
specifications that might be submitted. The
subject of iron armature for ships is one of
great general interest, not only to the navy
and country, but is engaging the attention of
the maritime pbwers oftfic world. Undcrthe
appropriation made by Congress, the Depart
ment, ou the favorable report of the Board,
has contracted for the construction of
three iron clad ships of different
models, the aggregate cost of ’which
■will be within thc'Umits of the appropriation.
The difficulty of combining the two qualities
oflight draught and iron armor, both of which
arc wanted for service on our coast, could not
he entirely overcome; but the Board, in this
new branch of naval architecture, lias, I think,
displayed great practical wisdom, and I refer
to their very full and able report, winch is ap
pended, for a more explicit and detailed ex
hibit of their inquiries and conclusions.
INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE NAVY.
The efficiency of the navy may unquestion
ably be largely increased by creating more
grades, and I would recommend that the per
manent organization of the line officers be as
follows;
Flag officer—to command squadrons.
Commodore, 1
Captain. To command
Commander, j single ships.
Lieutenant-commander, J
Lieutenant,
Master,
Passed-midshipman,
Midshipman.
Cadet.
The lieutenant-commanders, a grade used
during the Revolution, may be employed as
first lieutenants, and in the command of the
smaller class of naval vessels.
The present rate of pay may he so appor
tioned among the different* grades that In the
aggregate there shall be nolnerease. Let no
officer be advanced to any grade above that of
passed midshipman except" upon nomination
of the President and confirmation by the Sen-
ate, after u board of officers shaft*have pro
nounced him morallv, physically and profes
sionally competent to perform a*U Ids duties,
both ashore and afloat.
The public service would also be promoted
were some limit of age fixed by law for active
service. I would, therefore, respectfully sug
gest that line officers be retired sifter having
been forty-five years in the navy, excepting
when called into active service bv special
pointment from the President. ~A generous
pecuniary provision should be made for those
who are retired after long and faithful service.
To satisfy the immediate demands of the
public service, I recommend that a grade to
be designated fiag officer be established, and
that the President, by selection from the pres
ent list of captains and commanders, appoint
a number not exceeding seven, who shall each
have command, irrespective of seniority or
rank,ofthc squadron to which he mav be assign
ed, and the appointment shall cease when the
officer hauls down his flag, unless for distin
guished and meritorious conduct in battle, as
flag officer, he receives, upon recommendation
of the President, the thanks of Congress.
EMPLOYMENT OF FUGITIVES.
In the coastwise and blockading duties of
the navy has been not tmtrequent that fugi
tives from insurrectionary places have sought
our ships for refuge and protection, and our
naval commanders have applied to me for in
struction as to the proper disposition which
should be made of such refugees. My answer
has been that, if insurgents, they should be
handed over to the custody of the Government;
but if, on the contrary, they were free from
any voluntary participation In the rebellion
and sought the shelter and protection of our
flag, then they should be cared for and em
ployed in some useful manner, and might be
enlisted to serve on onr public vessels or in
our Navy Yards, receiving wages for their la
bor. If such employment could not befnmuhed
to all l»j the nary, they might be referred to the
anny, and if no employment could be found for
them in the public service they should be allotccd
iopivcccd freely and peaceably without restraint
to seek a livelihood in any loyal portion of the
country. This I have considered to be the
whole required duty, in the premises, of our
naval officers.
NAVAL DEPOT ON THE LAKES.
I have been desired to invite attention to
the fact that there is no naval depot ou the
lakes, notwithstanding the vast amount of
tonnage on the frontier, and to state that if
there were one, and the ability to arm the
merchant marine, our rights on the lakes
would be made secure.
ESTIMATES AND ATPUOPBIATIONS.
The amount appropriated at the last regular
session of Congress for the naval service for
the current year was $13,168.6*0.86. To this
was added at the special session in July last,
SCO,44o,B7s.9l—making for the fiscal year end
ing June 30, 3862, an aggregate 0f543,615,-
551.77. This sum will not be sufficient, how
ever, for the purpose, and, therefore, additional
appropriations will be necessary. There will
be required to pay for vessels purchased, and
for necessary alterations incurred in fitting
them for naval purposes, the sum of $2,530,00(q
for the purchase of additional vessels, $2,000,-
000, and for the construction and completion
of twenty iron-clad vessels, sl2,ooo,ooo—mak
ing a total of $16,530,000. This sum is inde
pendent of the estimates submitted for the
next fiscal year, and being required for current
expenses, as well as objects of Immediate Im
portance, it is desirable should receive early
attention from Congress,
The estimates submittedbythis Department
for the fiscal yearending June 30.1863. amount
to $44,625,665.02, viz.:
For the navy proper $41,096,530.25
For the marine corps 1,105,656.77
For navy yards, hospitals, magazines,
and miscellaneous objects 2,488,478.00
The reports of the chiefs of the bureaus and
the commandant of the marine corps, with
their accompanying estimates, exhibit in de
tail tbs objects for which the appropriations
are required. I would also refer to these re-

SYNOPSIS AND STATISTICS.
From the Report of the Postmaster General
it appears that the whole number of post offi
ces in the United States on the 30th of June,
1861, was 28,580; and that the entire number
of cases acted upon during the same period

The estimate of the total expenditures for
1863 Is somewhat less than those of previous

arises from the fact that only partial estimates
arc made for the cost of postal service in Slates
where it is now suspended.
The appropriation for defences in 1862 was
$5,301,350.63, while the amount estimated to
be required from, the Treasury for 1860, is

The number of dead letters.yoturned un

year was 111,147, wlHi-IT, added tttTfrc-rmtniwr
of domestic letters (103,880) sent out as above,
gives the whole number sent out from the
dead letter office for the vear, 215,033.
The result of successful investigation in
7,560 cases confirms the past experience of the
Department, that the failure of a letter to
reach its destination is, in the vast majority of
instances, the fault alone of the writer or
sender. Out of thcabove 7,500 ’valuable dead
letters, 3,095 were directed to the wrong office;
40/ were imperfectly addressed; 612 were di
rected to transient persons: 257 to parties who
had changed their residences; 821 were ad
dressed to fictitious persons or firms; So were
uncalled for; 10 without any directions; 2,136
were not mailed for want of postage stamps;
79 were mlssent; and for the failure of post
masters to deliver 133, no satisfactory reason
was assigned. The Department therefore can
justly be held responsible for the non-delivery
of but 212 of these letters.
Much other valuable data is given on this
subjectj and it is worthy of remark, that out
of 7(5,701* letters before alluded to, originating
in the loyal States, and addressed to residents
of disloyal States, 40,000 could not be re
turned, cither because the siguaturo of the
writer was incomplete, or because the letter
contained no clue to his residence. The ex
perience of the Department shows that a large
proportion of domestic letters written by edu
cated persons, and particularly women, arc
delieient in one or both of these respects.
In view of these and other facts, the Post
master General suggests that valuable dead
letters, when returned to their owners should
be charged with treble the ordinary rates of
comprising one rate for return trans
portation to the dead letter office, one rate for
registration there, and one rate for return
transportation to the writers or owners.
A treaty with Mexico has been conclud
ed, awaiting the ratification by Mexico, estab
lishing a common international rate of twen
fv-five cents on letters, with other useful pro
visions.
The Postmaster-General has accepted the
offer made in 1557 by Great Britain for a re
duction of the international rate between the
two countries on letters, from twenty-four to
twelve cents, which, however, has not yet
gone into operation, as it awaits the response
of the British office.
The above abstract presents merely a few of
the points of the important report.
Tiic Postmaster-General gives at length his
reasons for the change of contracts, fonlisloy
alty. Not only woslt unsafe, he says, to en
trust the transportation of the mails' to a per
son who refused or failed to recognize the
sanctity of an oath, but to continue payment
of public money to the enemies of the Govern
ment and their allies, was to give direct aid
and comfort to treason in arms. We could
not thus permit this branch of government to
contribute to Its own overthrow.
The Postmaster-General also gives his rea-
sons for excluding disloyal publications from
the mails. To await the results of slow judi
cial prosecution was to allow crime to be con
summated, with the expectation of subsequent
punishment, instead ol preventing its accom-
Slishmcnl by prompt and direct interference,
•f the cases presented for his action, upon the
principles which he names, he has, by order,
excluded from the malls twelve of these trea-
sonablc publications, of which several had
been previously presented by the grand jury
ns Incendiary and hostile to constitutional au
thority.
"While the Postmaster General did not claim
the authority to suppress any newspaper,
however disloyal and treasonable Us contents,
the Department could not be called upon to
give them circulation. “It could not and
would not interfere with the freedom secured
by law, but it could and did obstruct the dis
semination of that license which was without
the pale of the constitution and law. The
mails established by the United States Gov
ernment could not, upon anv known princi
ples of law and public right, tie used for its de
struction. As well could the common carrier
be legally required to transport a machine de
signed for the destruction of the veldcle con
veying it, or an inn-keeper he compelled to en
tertain a traveler whom he knew to be intend
ing to commit a robbery in his house.
He finds these views 'supported by the high
authority of the late Chief Justice Story, of the
Supreme Court of the United States, whose
opinion he quotes.

FROM ST. LOUIS.
[Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.]
St. Loris, December 5,1881.
Gen. Halicck’s order for quartering the
Union refugees from the Southwest, in the
houses of avowed secessionists, and feeding
and clothing them at their expense, has crea
ted great excitement among the scccsh.
The business of attending to refugees has
been taken in hand by the Sanitary Commis
sion, who will ascertain their numb er and con
dition, and make requisition upon the Provost
Marshal for accommodations necessary, when
the latter will then seize empty houses owned
by sccesh, and call upon secesh merchants for
articles required.
The Union men arc highly delighted with
the order, and the praise of Gen. Hallcck is
on every lip.
A high Republican authority here is re
sponsible for the following: That Judge Gam
ble, now Governor, is soon to be appointed
on the Supreme Bench by Lincoln, and Frank
Blair to be appointed Senator by Gamble, vice
Trusten Polk. Also, that Bates is to resign
the Attorney Generalship in favor of Samuel
T. Govcr, a leading St. Louis lawyer. The
story has some probability.
It is the current belief that the cider quar
tering Southwestern Unionists is to be turned
to advantage by seizing a large number of va
cant buildings owned by Polk, and if the lat
ter objects, compelling him to take the oath of
allegiance; and if he refuses the oath, he will
be expelled from the Senate, to make room for
Blair. It is probably a fact that Polk’s build
ings will be seized to-morrow, as his agents
have been extraordinary exertions to
rent buildings to-day. It is proper to add
that other circumstances confirm the proba
bnicy of such a scheme.

with Gem Grant onboard, went down to Co-
Imnbnsitearing a flag of truce. Lieutenant
Coloncjphappcl, of Thompson’s force, was re-
it. [This case is given in detail in
our Capo letter elsewhere.— Eds.]
Advices in the Memphis Appeal of the 4th
state tfeft a fight had occurred at Morristown,
Tennessee, between 2,000 Unionists and some
secession troops. The former had been victori
ous, and/rebel reinforcements were being sent
there., The Fcderal forces were led by Brown*
low with 3,000 men. The fight took place on
Sunday, Ist inst. The victory of the Union
the rebels themselves pronounce “the
first Union succees of the war.”
Tire above news is brought by the Titan,
just uj from Columbus, whether she went to
exchange Camp Jackson prisoners. About
midnight of Wednesday night- she went to
within one mile of the town and was met by
the rebel steamer Tazoo, with Polk, McGow
an. and others on board. Colonel Bnford bad
a lonjr conference with Gen. Polk concerning
prisoners. Result not known. It is denied by
the rebels that Hollins’s steam ram has visited
Memphis. ‘ She was looked for, but is still re*
pairing at New Orleans from injuries received
in Hollins's great sea fight.
The, rebels say Memphis must share the fate
of Columbus, and much property is being sent
into -the interior for greater safety, A dis
patch from Richmond, of the 2d, states that
three members from Missouri had arrived
theis and taken scats in tbc House. Others
wert on their way there.
CoU Dougherty, wounded atßeliuont, is do
ing Tvell.
Tlic Confederates daily expect an attack at
Columbus, and arc making great preparations.
The. Appeal said planters were burning their
cotton crops in the South at all threatened
points, and called the act patriotic.
In regard to the flag of truce to-day, it was
in accordance with an agreement made yester
day while transferring the Camp Jackson pris
oners.
The object was in reference to the release
of our prisoner at Memphis, and it is likely
to be accomplished.
I have information from a reliable source
that there will be five desperate stands made bv
the Confederates,between Columbus and Mem
phis, preparations for which arc being exten
sively made.
The Confederates cxpressltheirdetermination
not to yield under any circumstances, until
their object is accomplished, and as I heard
expressed, “until their last cartridge was
fired.” But their greatest hopes for success is
predicated upon the rcmovaljof Gen. Grant, to
whom they accord great military genius.
They arc also in considerable alarm concern
ing our gunboats. A further conference trill
be had concerning our prisoners.

Mr. CHANDLER, of Mich., offered a reso
lution to appoint a committee of three to in

Mr. LANE, of Kansas, moved to amend bv
inserting Springfield, Wilson’s Creek and
Lexington.
Mr. CHANDLER said he hoped the resolu
tion would not be amended.
Mr. LANE said the man most entitled to
honor laid been punished at Wilson’s Creek.
He perished and was sacrificed because he was
not relieved when he could have been. The
people want to know whether the gal
lant Gen. Lyon was sacrificed. They want
to know why regiments were sent to Cairo in
stead of to his relief, and why the army moved
at a snail’s pace to reinforce Mulligan at Lex
ington. The people wanted to know the
names of those who permitted these things,
and in his (Lane’s) opinion, thev would not
look far for the man who permitted the sacri
fice of Gen. Lrou.
Mr. Lane’s amendment was disagreed to.
Mr. GRIMES, of lowa, offered a substitute
to appoint a joint committee of two Senators
and three members of the House to investi
gate the causes of tbe disasters to our armv.
On motion of Mr. FESSENDEN, the sub

Mr. WILSON gave notice that he should to
morrow introduce a bill to abolish sutlers in
the volunteer forces.
Mr. GRIMES moved to take up the resolu
tion to investigate the case of Col. Miles. He
said a court of inquiry had found that Col.
Miles was intoxicated to a certain extent,
enough to justify Col. Richardson to apply
epithets to him, but not enough to remove
him from command. He wanted till the tacts
of the case to go to the people. The resolu
tion was agreed to.
Mr. TRUMBULL, of Illinois, introduced his
bill for confiscating the property and giving
freedom to the slaves of rebels. He said it
provides for the absolute and complete forfeiture
forever to the United States of every species of
property , real and jxrsoual, wherever situated,
within the United States, belonging to per
sons beyond the jurisdiction of the United
States, or beyond reach of civil process in
the ordinary mode of judicial proceedings, in
conscience of the present rebellion, who,
during its existence, shall take up arms against
the United States, or in any wa\* aid and abet
the rebellion—this forfeiture to he enforced
against property in the rebellions districts
through the military power; and all property
of other persons of the United States,
where the judicial power is not ob
structed by the rebellion, through the
courts; and that the proceeds of the property
of each individual seized and forfeited be sub
ject to the just claims of loyal creditors, and
to be held for the benefit of loyal citizens de
spoiled of property by the rebellion, and to
defray the expenses incurred in its suppres
sion. The hill also forfeits the claims of all
rebels and those who give them aid and com
fort, to the persons they hold in slaverv. The
hill declares that ffru'cs thus forfeited'shall be
free, and makes it the duty of the President to
provide for the colonization of such as mav
be willing to go to some tropical countrv,
where thc} T may have The protection of the
Government and he secured in all the
rights and privileges of free men. The
property belonging' to traitors, or those
giving them aidl«r comfort, who mav be con
victed by judicial tribunals, is to be* forfeited
on their conviction—the real estate for life and
personal property forever.
Mr. TRUMBULL made a lengthy argument
in support of the bill. The bill was ordered
to be printed. Referred to the Judiciary Com
mittee.
Mr. CLARK crave noticethat he should offer

Mr. GURLEY said it was contended, on

was referred to a Select Committee.

FBOMTHE SECRETARY OF STATE
Washington, Dec. 5. —The following order
has been to-day issued:
Department op State. )
Washington, December 4.1861. f
To Major General George 3. McClellan, IfaM
mgton :
General—l am directed by the President to call
your attention to the following subject; Persons
claimed to be held to sendee or labor under the
laws tif the State of Virginia, and actually em
ployed in hostile sendee against the Government
of the United State?, frequently escape from the
lines of the enemy’s forces, andarereceived within
the linos of the army of the Potomac. This De
partment understands that such persons, after
wards coming into the citv of Washington,
are liable to be arrested by the city police
on the presumption arising from color, that thev
are fugitives from sendee dr labor. Bv the fourth,
section of the act of Congress approved Aug. 6th.
ltdil. entitled. •* An act to confiscate property used
for insurrectionary purposes,” such employment
is made a full and sufficient answer to any further
claims to sendee or labor. Persons thus employed
and escaping are received into a military protec
tion of the United States, and their arrests as fu
gitives from labor or service should be immediate
ly followed by military arrest of theparties making
the seizure. Copies of this communication will be
sent to the Mayor of the City of Washington and
to the Marshal of thel»iptrict of ColumhiuTthat any
collision between the military and civil authorities
may be avoided.
1 am. General, your very obedient servant,
William H, Seward.
From Washington,
Washington, Dec. s.— Several vessels,
some of large size, have arrived from the
Lower Potomac. One passed the rebel but
teries in daylight, but unmolested.
Thy paper relating to foreign aflliirs, accom
panying the President's Message, covers 425
pages, beginning with Buchanan’s circular of
February 28th; the last addressed to our min
isters abroad by Secretary Black.
Washington, Dec. s.—The Chief Justice
and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court
paid their respects to the President on Mon
day at the Executive Mansion.
An army order, Just issued by the Secretary
of War, directs all officers and enlisted men of
the volunteer service, now prisyners in the
hands of the enemy, or reported*as missing in
action, or who may hereafter be taken prison
ers or reported missing, he transferred to skele
ton regiments to be formed by the Governors
of the respective States, to consist entirely of
such missing officers and men. The vacancies
thus occasioned in the regiments will be tilled
by the Governors of the various States to
which the regiments belong.
Vice President Hamlin has appointed Sena
tors Fessenden and Trumbull, Resents of the
Smithsonian Institution, to till the vacancies
occasioned by the death of Senator Douglas
and the treason of Mason.
Assistant Surgeon J. C. Herndon, of Vir
ginia, has been dismissed, by direction of the
President, from the army, Vor deserting his
post; also Major Lyude, for a similar reason,
and for subsequently surrendering his com
mand to an inferior force of insurgents in New
Mexico.
Mustering officers who have not already done
so, arc requested to send the rolls on'whieh
they have mustered regiments, to the Adjutant
General's office, in "Washington.
A Richmond paper, of the 3d, says Messrs.
Bell, West and Conrad took seats in Congress
to-day from Missouri. A dispatch from Rich
mond save a grand demonstration will be
made on York river by the Unionists to weak
en the Potomac lines.
Information has been received that there arc
twelve forts around Centerville, defended by
field pieces only; no heavy guns. Four regi
ments of the enemy have lately left Centre
ville for“Leesburg, where there are now about
30,000 men. The pickets of Gen. Smith’s di
vision were fired upon last night at Lewins
villc, but no injury was done. Last night a
deserter from life rebels, named Williams,
entered our lines. He is an Englishman, and
was taken out of his bed at Charieston on the
night of the 4th of June and pressed into the
rebel service. He was a private in the 14th
South Carolina regiment, but has been, for
some weeks, a servant oif Gen. Beauregard.
He escaped on Monday last. He was dressed
in a new uniform of blue, like those of the
New York soldiers, and having the New York
buttons on. He says the whole regiment was
supplied with such uniforms only a week since,
and that the current report was that they had
been received in the South from Boston. He
states that there Is an abundance of good shoes
for those of the men who can pay • for them.
The pair he had on he paid six dollars for.
The intention of Generals Porter, McCall,
Hancock, and Wadsworth, was to scour th.‘
country from Vienna to Hunter's Hill. No
enemy was seen, except two small parties—
one of three men, beyond Vienna, and one of
two "miles beyond Hunter’s
Mill, to neither of which could we get closer.
No enemy has been seen in the region they
visited since Sunday.
