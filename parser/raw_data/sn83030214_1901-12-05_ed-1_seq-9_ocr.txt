THE MESSAGE ABROAD.
gEBJfAN, AUSTRIAN AND BRITISH COM
JIENT- THE MONROE DOCTRINE.
Berlin. Dec. 4.— The officials of the Foreign
Office h« re make : a special application of Presi
dent Roosevelt's definition of the Monroe Doc
trine in ■* Message t0 Congress to Germany's
d is[Uf with Venezuela. A Foreign Office offi
cial intimated to the correspondent of The As
sociated Pres« to-day that while a friendly ad
jastment. of Germany's claims is still expected.
a forcible settlement might become Germany's
duty at no distant date. Such a settlement, if
gpefFary would not Infringe on the Presi
dent'" policy, " r offend the United States in the
le*st p»rt*al«r.
ir!iCi;il also said that the President's
iir.nii? ra ' ] " views were not of special interest
,jem .iry now, because the emigration to
.Africa was inconsiderable.
VJenn. Th-<\ .— Discussing President Roose
xeli's Mersage to Congress, the Austrian papers
ar e unanimous in pra-sing the references to an-
Mttfc**, ■ v*u * on other points they are not quite
so laudatory.
The •"Fremdenblatt" comments on its peace
ful tone, remarking that President Roosevelt
evidently will not allow himself to be carried
gwß v by senseless chauvinists.
Th<- -Xeue-Wiener Tageblatt" dwells on Its
•imperialistic character," adding:
There lives in America a spirit, as an "ap
pendat.i ' to the Monroe Doctrine formula. of
Eur ■■■ for the Americans, and this formula, al
though clad in the most peaceful phrases, per
vades the Message.
Th» "Deutacfce Volksblatt" declares that the
policy ennadatal must expand American pro
ducti'iv 'iid therefore "measures for the pro
tection of Austrian production are required by
the ih tatf of self-preservation."
Th- Austrian Volks-Zeitung" believes that
the strength of the Message lies in the modera
ta t..!>-. adding:
It ppeaks in the language of a strong man
who knows he requires no sonorous words to be
bei-rd.
The "Xeue-Wiener Journal." also dealing with
the power of the Message, recommends its close
study, so as to "find means, at the proper time,
of sr>..;];r:r his game."
The "Wi-ner Morgan-Zeitung," following simi
lar lines, declares that the governments of all
civilized States will only too soon recognize the
■I— r rili danger that these measures con
stitutf for the commercial policy of foreign
ctmm'-r.i'ier-.
London. Dec. 4.— President Roosevelt's Mes
sa^t- to Congress holds the first place in the
afternoon newspapers here to-day. The com
ment tm it. however, differs little from that of
the morning papers. Strong, general approval
of the pronouncement, which, as "The St.
■Vsses*s Gazette" says, "strikes notes of con-
Edous strength and assured success," is the
pervading tone of the editorials.
"The spirited declaration for Monroeism will
cause a flutter in Europe." says "The "West
mirster Gazette," which continues:
If the Kaiser is really of the opinion, as al
leged, that "the American Peril" is the question
sf the future for Europe, he will find confirma
tion in the Message. He will envy Secretary
Ga^.'s surplus of £15.000.000 available for liuild
ing ironclads or other purposes, for the Ameri
can doctrine backed by the American surplus
means that many European ambitions in South
America are foredoomed to failure. V»'e do not
doubt that it is the policy of this country, if
called upon to make a choice, to stand by the
United States m defence of the doctrine. We
are also an American power, and it was we who
first suggested the idea.
After noting that South America, the on'y
outlet Ear the surplus population of Europe, is
largely in the possession of the -orrupt Spanish,
over wh'.ni the I'nited States throws its aegis
■without guaranteeing good government, "The
Wfjtminster Gazette" concludes:
It is r.ot easy to affirm this in the interests of
mankind, ami -*\ h- :i the- Tniu-d States, after
■warning Europe sot to enter America, proceeds
itself to step out from the American continent,
even a theoretical defence is difficult. The situ
ation has the germs cf an immense controversy
ir. the future.

MESSAGE PKAI6BD IN MEXICO.
Mexico City, Dec. 4. — President Roosevelt's
Message has been favorably received in
government and business circles. The general
comment is that his declaration in favor of Cu
ban independence and a free trade policy with
the island will greatly strengthen American
prestige all over Latin-America, and that he has
disarmed the clerical press of one of its prin
cipal arguments against the Washington gov
ernment. "The Mexican Herald" to-day says
of ihe Message:

ought to adopt.

E. S. STOKES WILL PROBATED
DOCUMENT CONTESTED KY TIIK TESTA
TOR'S COUSIN ADMITTED BY
SURROGATE THOMAS.
Surrogate Thomas yesterday admitted to pro
bate as the last will and testament of Edward
S. Stokes an instrument which the latter had
signed and executed on March 22, IN'.i4. at the
Hoffman H. me. In this will James D. Leary
and Elizur V. Foote v -re named as executors.
There was an earlier will, executed on February
18, 1V.»1, under which W. K. D. Stokes, a cousin
of the deceased, is made pole executor.
The admission to probate of the later will was
contested by w. B. D. Stokes on a number of
ground?. Under the first will Nancy Stokes.
the mother of Edward B. Stokes, who died before
him: Mrs. Mary J. HcNutt, a Bister, an i Horace
Stokes, of Hackettstown. a brother, were the
chief beneficiaries. Under the last will th<- Milk
of the fortune poes to the moOier. with the pro
vision that .m her deatn the brother and sister-
Horace Stokes and Mary J. IfcNntt— 3hall be the
beneficiaries.
Elizur V. Foote. n whf.se petition the will
was admitted to probate, was accompanied by
his lawyer. Charles E. Huphes. of Carter.
Hughes ft Dwight. The only witnesses exam
ined were the subscribing witnesses to the l s '.'4
■will, Charles Plattner. a director of th" Hoffman
House, and George VV. Cornish, a former secre
tary of E. S. Stokes.
The testimony of the witnesses went t<> show
that the will was executed at the office of the
Hoffman House on March 22, 1891, and that
at the time the testator was of suur.d mind and
free from restraint.
Mr. Hughes filed a letter of objection to the
issuing of letters of administration to Mr. I.i-ary,
one of the executors. There were a number of
reasons stated, the chief one beinp that the
testator had wanted to eliminate him as a:i
executor under the will.
The Surrogate said that this would have to
be argued under a separate action, but con
sented that no letters should be issued until Mr.
Leary had been examined.

FIRST MISSIONARY CONFERENCE OF F.PIS
COPAL CHURCH OPENS IN ROCHESTER.
[BY TELKGRVI-U T<> THE TRIBfNn.)
Rochester. K. V., Dec. The first general mis
sionary conference In the history of the Protestant
Episcopal Church in this country opened here this
morning for a four day meeting. The importance
of the gathering has brought together the leading
churchmen of the country. Bishops and ministers,
deacon? and laymen have come, from the Pacific
Coast, the far Southwest, and even from Brazil,
to discuss the missionary interests of their Church.
Although this is the first day, nearly two hundred
clergymen have already arrived.
" The present conference is held at a critical time
ir the history cf the Church, which is questioning
the advisability of branching out Into new fields
or making agsrressive progress in the present mis
sionary jurisdictions. This is particularly true in
the matter of the new bishopric in. the Philippines,
and the discussion of the move is being awaited
with great Interest. ■
To-day has been given up to devotional exercises.
An early celebration of the Holy Communion was
held in Christ's Church, followed by an elaborate
service with a sermon in St. Luke's Church. The
]{f-v William D, Wr.lker. Bishop of Western New-
York was celebrant, nnd he also delivered the
address <>f welcome. The Rev. Dr. William B.
Undine reci.ir of the Church of the Saviour, Phila
delphia", preached the sermon.
Among the well known prelntra of the Church
already preseri or expected to nrriv<* hy to-morrow
are Bishop-elect Braal of the Philippine Islands,
Bishop Rowe of Ai.iFka. -Bishop Kin--o!v-mg of
Bra«lL Bishop Nelson of Georgia, Bi.-!.op Pet»j-kin
of West Virginia. Bishop Doane o' Albany, and th.'

NEW- YORK DAILY TRIBUNE. THURSDAY. DECEMBER 5. 1901.
ANOTHER MAX IX A BOX.
THE DRAMA.
LYCEUM THEATRE.
The course ir. the dramatic expression of path
ology was continued last night at the Lyceum
Theatre. The occasion was the rirs* performance
of a new play by Clyde Fitch, called "The Girl
and the Judge." Mrs. Stanton was a thief. She
was "caught with the goods" when she lived in
Ncw-Y.rk. where Messrs. Arnold. Constable &
Co. Inconsiderately mad- a fuss because some
lace belonging to them was found in her
muff. It was nothing to them that she
stole as the birds sang, no! because she wouM,
but because she must. This drove poor Mr. Stan
ton to drink, a happiness which all men have wh<>n
everything else has cone against them. With their
daughter they then went to a new place, further
West, and t"ok a new name, that of White. Ilut
when they t;..- off the ears Mr. White, alias Stan
ton, could bear livinu with a thi.T no longer, and
Mts White, alias Stanton, wondered how she had
live.! with a drunkard so long. The only
real disagre nun' between them was as to
win. h BhouM keep the daughter. Neither <«r
them cared to bring court proceedings and nothing
was further from thn thoughts of either than to
tell the truth. Bo an umpire was needed. They
could not ask the corner barkeeper to decide, be
cause he would be prejudiced In favor .>f the hus
band. and the pawnbroker on the opposite corn-r
was Ineligible, because of a like prejudice In favor
of the wife, bo they went t.. <;e,.rK" Buckingham
Chartris, who was doing business in the town as ;i
Judge. Their can was q.iite unofficial and unprofes
sional, and. as then- w:i n" sasfl before ;!.•• court
ar.d as he was not consulted as counsel for either
Side, be heard half the case ; ; r:d th. ii walked off
and told them to settle it among themselves, Th»
daughter then decided that sh-- would stay with
her mother, who promised not to Hteal if sho could
he!n it. and to pay frtquent visit? to her fattier.
who agreed to keep sober If convenient. The
;: | ■:■ und daughter hired a room at the house
of Mrs. Brown. The mother of the judge
had received c letter from ■ Mead i»
New-York about the coming of the Stan
tnns, then a dispatch and then another letter,
which last her son destroyed unread, lest It should
contain something which his mother ought not to
s.-e. having lirst paid two i ents* which was dIM for
extra postage. The moth, r, having thus been lr>
troduced to three stantons who did not appear,
called on the Whites, who did appear, bseaose
there were three of them, and that was the best she
BOUld do. She showed B pin whi.-h the Judge hatl
given her. and Mrs White s. creted It and trotted
off to the pawnbroker's with it. while the rest of
tin- people in the play were taking up the
stair carpet. The Judge then came -md to-
Msted that Miss Whit.- should be his
wife. She was only t • >- . glad, bui regarded
her mother as an obstacle Lying awake at mid
night. sh«- a*-, used her mother of stealing the pin.
She denied it at first, but. hearing the door bell
ring, confessed all, and K«ve up the pawn ticket.
The next day the party assembled al the pawn
broker's, redeemed the pin and put to confusion
tin- judge's secretary, the daughter of the land
lady, whom Mrs while bad accused of taking the
pin. Mr. and Mrs. White then determined, in the
interest of their daughter's happiness, to go away
togeth< r and to try still another place, in the com
forting consciousness that there were plenty more
places left, if the next one should also prove a
failure.
In delightful contrast with tl\e maudlin silliness
cf tiu- i<lay was the reception accorded by the au
dience to the actors who were the interpreters of it.
There was not a part which was not well played,
and most of the parts were acted by old and tried
favorites, whom the aodienoe Kreetf-.; with afft—
tionaU'-cheer and goodwill. Mrs. G. H. Gilbert, who
will never lose the tove of the New-York
public as loiik as it is permitted to see her.
or as long as it can remember her, made the
mother '>f the Judge a sweet and gentle personal
ity, as captivating as all the rest of this actress's
long list of stage portraits. Miss Annie Russell
gave to thf part of the daughter all the charm
which it could have. When she has MMBething
better to do she can do it, but there was no more
to be dune with a part Mkn this. Mi*s Emily Wake
man improved the better dramatic opportunities
of the mother. Mrs. McKee Hankin and Mme.
Mathilde Cotlrelly were both capital, the former as
the boarding house landlady, with sad memories of
lost New- York society, and the latter as the keeper
Of the pawnshop. Randolph Mordecai, as the
judge's secretary, defended his mother like a gen
erous and manly boy. and John Glendennlng was as
dignified as the ridiculous position of the drunken
husband of the thieving wife permitted him to be.
Orrln Johnson, as the judge, was not enabled to
show, except by his pleasing person, why the heroine
should love him, but, assuming that she had reasons
of her own, he sought and accepted her love grace
fully. Robert Hlckman was as real as life as the
judge's office man, and the cast was completed by
Arthur Schwartz, i boy, who was equally lifelike
as the unhopeful son of the pawnbroker. An ex
cellent audience appreciated the acting- fully, and
tittered when it co ild not help It at the play.

THE PASSING THRONG.
"A slight snow that freezes in this city." said M.
M. Ward, of Boston, at the Murray Hill Hotel
yesterday, "gives Infinitely more
THE trouble than would a real storm.

slipped every which way in their
efforts to get around. In fact, about the only way
they could navigate at all was by sticking to the
cartracks. I dined with a friend in Madison-aye.
last evening, and a great time I had of it getting
back downtown. In the first place, the people who
left the house before I did annexed my cab but
left theirs in its place. Of course, it was art
error and really made little difference, excepting
that the cabman ut first refused to take me. but I
at last showed him his error, and we starte<l on.
I had to go to the Holland House, and this js the
route we followed to get there. Down Madison
ave. to Forty-second-st.. through Forty-secona-st.
to Sixth-aye.. down Sixth-aye. to Thirty-fourth-st..
then down Broadway to Twenty-mnth-st. and
across that street to Fifth-aye., by which we went
to the hotel. , . 
"It was a circuitous but necessary route, tor, o>
following it, we were ab'- to stick to the car
tracks and the horse could make fair progress.
The poor brutt skatt-d so when he struck the ice
covered asphalt of Fifth-aye. that it took him al
most as long to cover the block from Twenty
ninth-st. to Thirtieth-st.. as it had for him to come
from Forty-second to Twenty-ninth-at."
"Not only that, but when we got to the Holland
House, the cabman utterly refused to drive to the
curb, on the ground that if he did

again. I guess he was right, but
for all that, I cannot see why. when such weather
as the present sets in. the cab and stable men
of the city do not have their horses sharp shod, so
that they" would not slip. They would save money,
both in the time they would thus economize in
petting about and in preventing the unfortunate
animals from seriously straining or injuring them
selves, by slipping or falling. On such a day as
yesterday the chapter of horse accidents in mis
city must have been a voluminous one The £»ew-
York of to-day is tc a great extent asphalt paved
and horse owners here would do well to take a up
from the horse owners of Washington or Buffalo,
the two Eastern cities that possess a greater sur
face of asphalt paved streets than New-\ork does.
In either city such a storm as yesterda> *f>uUl
send the horses of the town to the bla.-ksmith
shops in search of sharpened shoes. Bitter ex
perience has taught their owners the wisdom of
the old saw. that an ounce of prevention Is *orth
a pound of cure In shoeing its horses New--iork
is certainly at present pursuing a penny wise ana
pound foolish policy."
