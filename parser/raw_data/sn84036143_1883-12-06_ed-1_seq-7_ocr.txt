INTENT VS. THE LETTER
THE LAW.
OF
We do not propose to devote our space
chiefly to reviewing the decisions of the
courts, though recognizing the legal
right, and often propriety, in discussing
through the press questions of law that
greatlv concern the people. The ques
tion who shall do the little printing the
Territory needs concerns very few. 80
long as the work is done full as well, or
better, and at no increased cost, there
will not be a half dozen people in the
Territory who will waste a regret.
It is not right, however, that any por
tion of the people should for a time even
think that .Judge Wade's recent decision
was in disagreement with the best au
thorities on the subject of interpreting
law. All authorities concur that when
the letter of the law is clear, explicit,
without ambiguity, there is no chance
or occasion tor interpretation. Only
those things need interpreting that are
obscure, or in foreign tongues. When
the law says, in language that all can
understand, and none can misunderstand,
"that said contract shall be made and
continued in force for the period of two
years from the date of its execution,"
there is not a word or combination of
words that is involved in doubt, so there
is no room for the application of the
principle stated by Mr. Sedgewick.
The great expounder quotes a Montana
statute to show that the singular includes
the plural; the trouble is not so easily
removed. It was impossible in the
nature of the case for more than one con
tract tor the territorial printing to be
made immediate/;/ after the passage of the
act.
If the court is to run around the streets
or inquire of members of the legislature
what was the intent of any particular
law. there would be wide diversity of
opinion and no possibility of reaching a
just conclusion.
If the intent was, as the Independent
insists, to keep that ]taper alive, it was
clearly a case against public policy, and
accepting this avowed intent, it was the
dutv of the court to set it aside.
The Tinancy.of An "S."
It strikes us as ungrateful, to say the
least, that the Independent should slur the
intelligence of members of the Legislature
with whom, until now, it has been in polit
ical affiliation, by ascribing to their lack
of learning the chief cause which led to
the death of the Printing law. It is seri
ously charged that by the neglect of its
then partisan friends in the Assembly to
pluralize the singular number of a noun,
the Democratic organ is robbed of a pen
sion intended for its benefit in perpetuity.
This is the plain inference to be drawn
from the argument of the Independent, in
its alleged review of the decision of Judge
Wade. This aspersion, in the light of
known facts, will be universally regarded
as unwarranted. The paternity of the
Printing law' is traced back to the bill
drafted by the editor of the Independent,
(Barrett,) who stood sponsor for it and
lobbied it through the Assembly, with no
material amendment attached except as it
applied to a reduction in printing charges.
In no other essential particular was the
bill as originally prepared altered. We re
fuse to go back in the years to ascertain
whether, as suggested by the Independent,
there were more Missourians than
grammarians in the Legislative body that
passed its bill. 11 iseuough to know that there
rvere Missourians who disdained to be
reckoned grammarians outside of the Leg
islature, and we recall no one who more
jauntily plumed himself upon this circum
stance than the neAvspaper editor avIio
dreAv the printing bill, bossed it through
its various stages to a law, and Avas respon
sible not only for its orthography, but for
other and glaring defects which closed its
life after an existence protracted beyond its
time. _ _
Inter Mountain : We much regret to
see that the statesman-editor of the In
dependent, avIio was once a lawyer him
self both in Missouri and Montana, is
greatly angered at Judge Wade on ac
count of the latter's decision on the
printing Iuav. To those who only enjoy
the pleasure of an intimate acquaint
ance with Col. Woolfolk, it is very plain
that his anger has not been excited by
any prospective pecuniary loss. The
Colonel is not that kind of a man. He
probably cares less for the almighty dol
lar than any man in Montana and
spends his accumulations Avith a lavish
hand. His objection to Judge Wade's
decision, therefore, is by no means at
tributable to the probability of his los
ing a portion of the public printing.
The Colonel has no use for money. We
have his own eloquent words to the
effect that he pins his faith to the "great
popular heart" (very likely meaning that
of Maginnis) and filthy lucre is not in any
sense the object of his labors. It is quite
evident that the legal light of the In
dependent grounds his opposition to the
printing Iuav decision to the defectiv'e le
gal points upon which it is based and
upon the errors of his honor's conclu
sions. But here is a chance for argu
ment. The opinion is incontrovertible
on the score of legality, and this fact
renders it necessary for the public to con
clude that the Helena journalist knows
nothing about law. The mere question
of money certainly cuts no figure in the

Reduced Pay of Postal Officers.
The Washington Evening Star gives this
version of the removal of Inspector Furay,
of the Postal Service * " Captain John B.
Furay, late Postoffice Inspector at Omaha,
Nebraska, has taken issue with the Post
master General in behalf of the fifty-seven
Postoffice Inspectors in the country, and
intends to contest the retroactive force of
Judge Gresham's decision fixing the per f
diem allowance for expenses at the actual j
daily expenditure while traveling. Mr.
Furay claims that the chaDge was made in
November, and therefore could not affect
his October accounts. The Postoffice De
partment held the reverse, and asked Mr.
Furay to send in his bill on the new basis.
Mr. Furay wrote a very sharp letter to the
Department, denying the right to change
the pay of an employe withoui bis consent
after the service had been rend«
the receipt of this letter he wa
Mr. Furay intends to bring the matter to
an issue by an appeal to the courts." The
order of Judge Gresham affects other
branches of the service, including officers
of the raihvay mail divisions, whose pay
for October is to be audited and allowed
on the basis of the November decision.
1. Upon j
iamoved,
Dissatisfaction is general among Inspec- !
tors, Assistant Superintendents, and others.
One of the railway mail officers stationed
in Montana, Avas notified that his October
accounts were disalloAved and could only
be paid on the basis of the order of No
vember. He Avrote the Department to the ef
fect that the reduced pay Avas insutlicient
to support himself and family and asked
to be recalled from the Territory.
Silver Coin and Silver Bullion.
The Avay to keep up the standard value
of American coinage is to patronize the
manufacture od' the raw material into use
ful and economical articles of household
table use, and of ornaments of dress and
decoration. The conversion of silver bars
into useful articles of the table and orna
ments of personal adornment has assumed
such immense proportions that even the
simplest articles are made of solid silver,
and embrace a large portion of the stock of
every first class jewelry store. These facts
are practically illustrated in the great
variety of solid silver manufactured goods
just received by George 1'. Peeves & Co., of
Helena. A glance at the stock and a com
parison of the real silver Avith the prices
and appearance of the plated articles
will convince the purchaser that
it is economy to buy the very best, tor in
this line can the choicest and most beauti
designs be worked up by the mastei artists
of this country, which surpass all others in
the perfection of their chasings and de
signs of silverware and orurmeuts. Es
pecially is this true of the Gorham
Manufacturing Company, of Providence,
I«'bode Island, from Avhom Geo. P. Peeves
& Co. have just received their magnificent
supply of holiday silver goods. This com
pany consumes four tons of silver bars
every month in the manufacture of solid
silver goods, Avhich, in hard dollars,
amounts to one million two hundred and
eighty thousand. The numerous new ar
ticles which make up the large field of
family treasures embrace ice-cream knives
of the gilt antique battle-axe pattern, with
antique unmatched spoons. Pie knives,
crumb scrapers, soup ladles, gravy ladles,
forks and spoons, of the Marigold pattern ;
solid silver fruit dishes, card baskets, ice
cream bowls, invalid solid silver tea sets;
the latest styles of table, desssert,
coffee and tea spoons; solid
pepper and salts, oyster forks and present
ation cups ; in fact, the neAV opening of
solid silverware embraces presents from a
silver thimble to a diamond cross or neck
lace.
A specialty of George 1*. Peeves & Co. is
diamond setting, which can be seen at
their store in all the perfection of the art.
They have under the hands of their skillful
jeweler. Mr. Steinmetz, a gold cross being
set with diamonds to cost $1,300 dollars;
a crescent gold, diamond pin, to cost $800,
and a brooch that will cost $750.
The prices of their solid ware are as
low as the trade prices at Tiffany's, NeAV
York, or Levy's, in Philadelphia. Their
supply of mantle and ornamental clocks are
peculiarly adapted for useful and valuable
presents for the holidays. Also, gold and
silver Avatches for ladies and gentlemen.
Valuable oil paintigs and other precious
articles are lor sale, and as displayed in
their store they correspond in taste and or
namentation to the general display of fine
goods purchased especially for the holidays.
The stock of solid silver, which alone cost
OA r er $14,00o, is probably as fine as can be
found this side of Chicago.

In addition to the regular telegraphic
report, the usual editorial and local mat

resident portions of Helena were served
with the paper. The Herald printers
commenced to put the message in type at
1 o'clock p. m., Avitli a force strong
enough to have handled the com
plete document in five hours, but
the usual aggravating delays in transmis
mission failed to keep the compositors sup
plied with copy, and obliged the disposing

transmit by Avire the exact text of a paper
as formidable as that of the President's
message, especially to points as distant as
Montana, several distinct relays of opera
tors being required to take it up and report
it along the Avay. Especially is this true
as to the treasury statement, Avith its
formidable and confusing array of figures,

EDUCATIONAL TOPICS.
Entertaingly Discussed by a Montana
Teacher.
"As the twig is bent the tree is inclined."
Education has been defined as the process
of developing in due order and proportion
all the good and desirable parts of human
nature. Any educator, who has closely
watched the successive steps of growth
which takes place in every child's mind
cannot help believing in the application of
the natural law of development from the
general to the special.
A reed embodies all the characters of the
adult plant, and gradually develops the
individual parts—leaf, stem, flower and
fruit. In the child's mind exists all the
latent faculties and powers which, properly
cultivated, individualized and controlled,
will ultimately produce an educated per
son. The child recognizes nature as a
whole. Trees, flowers, valleys, mountains
and lakes are not individualized in the mind
He does not look upon a tree as a tree Avith
individual characteristics ; his perception
grasps it only in a general way. The
mountain as a mountain is of no special
interest to him until he is able to analyze,
in his mind, the individual characteristics
which produce the mountain scenery.
Seeing, Avith a child, is a bodily act,
while with a mature adult it should he
largely mental. The optic nerve receives
the impression of the picture, but the mind
should grasp the details ; it should be fully
aAvake. In the power of the mind to ana
lyze and individualize exists the difference
between a child and an adult—between an
educated and an uneducated person ; con
sequently the most practical and thorough
educational training must of necessity be
based upon a knowledge of these facts, and
act harmoniously Avith this Iuav of develop
ment.
Let us trace the features of the common
school system, as it is usually conducted,
and see if it attains the desired end. A
boy Avho has passed through his babyhood
and childhood until he is six years old, has
acquired a general fund of information
concerning the subjects with which he has
come in contact. If he has lived on a farm
lie recognizes the domestic animals by their
names, and knows something of their uses.
He has gleefully roamed the meadows and
Avaded in the brooks. His body and limbs
are individualized. Instead of going "on
all fours," he walks upon his feet. His
hands, which formerly assisted in propel
ling him along the floor, have long since
attained prehensile power, and administer
to the desires of the brain—in the words of
the naturalist they have become cephalized
early in his career. Innumerable ques
tions are constantly escaping his lips ; he
is athirst for facts—he is becoming trouble
some, he must be sent to school ! A spell
ing book and perchance a primary arithme
tic and slate are procured, and Avith this
"outfit" he proceeds to his prison-house,
for what healthy, vigorous child can have
any other idea as he looks upon the dingy
t UJJJ UU1V.1 iuxa ao uv luvao tuv
walls of the school-room, the careAVorn face
of the teacher, and listens to her fretful
tones ?
His individuality is lost, he becomes
merged in the unit of school discipline.
The development of the perceptive facul
ties, which naturally furnish the mind
with facts, is checked, his body and limbs
are shriveled with unnatural rest and inac
tivity at the very time exercise is required
to assist in the harmonious development of
his rapidly growing body.
But his body is not the only sufferer ; if
anything his mind sutlers still more.
What does lie care for the crystalized
thought of others (often poor crystals,)
when he has not, as yet, learned to use
language, even to tell a story of a few doz
en Avords, intelligently. What a child re
quires at this age is to see—to use his eyes
in collecting facts. "Let me see ! " is the
universal cry of childhood. His powers of
observation must develop during childhood
or lie forever dormant.
When I see a person who has no percep
When I see a person who has no percep
tive organs developed, phrenologically
speaking, I can readily reproduce his
youth. Physiological laws cannot be
broken with impunity. If the perception
is checked in youth it cannot be mastered
in middle ag ö . Memory, which in youth
is very active, should be fully employed in
describing simple objects, in reproducing
forms and colors impressed upon the mind
by observation.
"But," exclaims a fond parent, "if my
boy does not go to school when can he
learn anything ?"
Every parent should understand
enough of the natural sciences to be able
to furnish a child's mind with facts and
ideas, and keep it fully employed until he
is twelve years old, or longer if necessary,
until the physical development shall have
reached the point which will allow him to
spend the required number of hours in the
school room without dwarfing mind and
body.
With a strong body and a mind over
flowing with useful facts, the child may
enter school, and, under efficient teachers,
may master two or three grades of readers
in a term, and ascend the mathematical
ladder several rounds at a time. He can
apply his well trained perceptives and
analytical observation to his text book
studies, and thus make rapid strides in his
education.
I have spoken of elementary education
as it is and as it should be ; now we come
to the more practical question of, How can
it be carried on without violating nature's
laws and transferring the responsibility
from the parent to the teacher ?
Without discussing the various methods
proposed by educators in different coun
tries, I shall accept the ideas of Frœbel,
as taught in the private "Kindergarten"
schools of the country. There, children
trom three years old and npwards are
trained to use every muscle of the body in
the best manner—they are trained in indi
viduality. observation, language and
memory.
The organs of sight, hearing, feeling,
taste and smell are developed step by step
The perceptive organs, as form, size,
weight, color, order, calculation and local
ity are educated in a thorough manner,
while the moral and social .qualities are
carefully guided in the right channels.
Imitation and a careful training of hand
and eye assist greatly in developing the
children of these schools. This course of
training revives the mental faculties of
the dullest child, and the benefits arising
from it remain with them through life.
Nature, to brains thus quickened, be
comes an open book with illustrations on
every page.
Each plant is individualized in size,
form, color of the leaves, flowers and fruit.
Each tree stands forth an individual, Avith
its own peculiar form of trunk, branches,
foliage and fruit, and whenever or wherever
it is met Avith it is an old friend.
The mountain with its grassy slopes, its
Avooded gulches, bristling crags and storm
encircled summit, becomes a never ending
object of study and admiration, and he
enjoys it in the same degree as he is able
to analyze the separate characteristics
Avhich unite to form the picture. Truly,
he perceives "Tongues in the trees, books
in the living brooks, sermons in stones, and
good in everything."

[Inter-Mountain, Dee. 1.]
About one o'clock this morning, as John
Griffin, a well-known Union Pacific con
ductor, recently transferred to the Utah &
Northern line, was stepping from a caboose
to the track, a freight car which was unex
pectedly passing knocked him down and
ran over him, inflicting injnries from which
he died in about an hour. Dr. Whitford
was called as soon as the acc. dent hap
pened, but the unfortunate man was in
jured too severely to give any hope of
recovery. Deceased was a single man
about 35 years of age, and was in every
way worthy of the esteem in which he was
held by the company employes. Mr. Grif
fin was sober, industrious and reliable, and
his untimely death, while yet in the enjoy
ment of health, vigor and usefulness, is par
ticularly sad. The funeral services will
take place to-morroAv.
