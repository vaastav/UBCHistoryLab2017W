LIBERALS WILL HOLD ON.
Government to Stand or Fall on
Free Trade Issue.
London. Dec. 11.— The government's determi
nation that there shall be no immediate drsso
lutkm of Parliament, but that the ministers
will meet Parliament at its next session with an
Important programme, of which the budget will
be a leading feature, was announced by I'remler
Asquiih at a dinner given for. him at the Na
tional Liberal Club to-night by two hundred
members of bis rarty as a murk of thrir appre
i iation and confidence.
In a speech justifying the legislative work
which the Liberals already had accomplished
Mr. A-quith invited the party to treat the veto
of the House .->f 1,0rd9 qs the dominating issue
in politics, but he declined to dissolve Parlia
ment at the dictation and caprice of the upper
chamber. To admit such a claim on the p;irt of
an irresponsible chamber, the Premier sail,
would be immeasurably absurd, as it would ren
der the Liberal government subject, aeasfou
after session, to a series of general elections.
The government would, therefore, choose its
own.JinM for dissolution.
With regard to the next session or Parliament
Mr. Asquith said he was unable at this stage
to specify the details of th* programme which
would Ix? put forward, but he sajd it would not
be a colorless list of non-contentious measures.
The chief work would be concerned with the
budget and the weighty domestic issues therein
involved, and on it the government would .stand
or fall, or at any rate be judged. It would
raise again, in its most acute form, the Premier
concluded, the great controversy of free trade
against protection.

A £7,000.000 SKYSCRAPER
FIELD ESTATE FIFTH
AVENUE PROJECT.
Mrs. Sage Buys Block in Riverside
Drive — (liristian Science Church'
Had Option on It.
The heirs of the Marshall Field estate have
had tentative plans drawn for a sixteen story
store and office building for the easterly block
front in Fifth avenue, between 90th and 31st
street!?. The site is said to be valued at $4.
000,000. It lias a frontage of 197 feet on the
avenue, I«>4 feet on 30th street and '-'00 feet on
.'.lst street. The building to be erected and the
site represent an investment of $7,000,000.
It was said yesterday that these plans do
not mean that such a structure ha* been de
cided on, but indicate a desire on the part of the
heirs to reach an understanding as to what kind
of Improvement would be most suitable for tlv
properly. It was also f-aid that even after a
plan proved acceptable to the heirs it would be
come years before the project would be car
ried out. Thus the present leases on the site
would not be affected by any aciion of the
estate.
Mrs?. Margaret O. Sage, widow of Russell Sage,
bought yesterday through the Frank I-. Fisher
Company the block front in Riverside Drive, be
tween 109 th and 110 th streets, for about $400,000
The Wbltlock estate was the seller. Mrs. Sage
also owns the block front on the northerly side of
169 th street, between Broadway and Riverside
Drive, and also the block front on the southerly
side of noth street (Cathedral Parkway), be
tween Broadway and Riverside Drive. In other
words, this purchase, makes her the owner of
the entire block bounded by 109 th and 110 th
streets, Broadway and the Drive, with the ex
ception of the Broadway frontage.
Last week the First Church of Christ Scientist
obtained an option to buy the Drive block front.
It was the Intention of the church to erect on
th" premises a structure for the especial use of
the members of the congregation who are un
able to attend service at its home at 96th street
and Central Park West, th« 96th street church
not being large enough for the needs of the
church. It -was said that the house of worship
to be built on the plot would cost $300,000. The
church decided not to exercise Its option because
of rumors that the Drive block front might be
needed for an approach for a bridge to New Jer
sey.
The block front told by the Whitlock estate
has a frontage of 379 feet on the Drive. 1.M.7
feet on 101»th street and IOS.S feet on 110 th
street. Mrs. Sage has loans on Manhattan real
estate aggregating over $30,000,000. She has
not figured prominently as a buyer.

ASSAILED BY PRESIDEXT.
Committee Appointed to Advise Ac
tion on Seer* t Service Clause of
Message Voit Vmmmn
(From Th» Trll>i_r.»> Kjr»*u. ]
Washington. Dec. II. — The House -*■»
threw down the gage of battle to the President,
taking the first step in a programme ■which
may be followed by sensational develop
ments.! Without debate and by a unanimous TOW
it passed a resolution, introduced by Representa
tive Perkins, of New York, providing that a
committee of five members be appointed ■•>
"consider- the statements contained in the me?
sage of the President' relating to th»» Secret
Service "and report to the House what action,
if any. should be taken in reference thereto."
The Speaker immediately appointed a nit'»«
consisting oi R^nr^s^ntntives Perkins). Denby. of
Michigan; Week«. of Massachusetts; JohrrSharp
Williams. of Mississippi, and IJoyd. of Mis
souri. This committee will hold its preliminary
meeting to-morrow morning, and hopes ti» b»
able to report to the House on Monday. It ',*
expected that it will recommend that the portion
of the. message to which certain m»mlyrj «f
Congress have taken violent exception b^ laH
on the Speaker's table, in which <-as<» it « 111 not
appear in the record of the House pn>c*er!ing*
and will never again be officially heard of.
THE RESOLUTION* ADOPTED.
The House had scarcely convened wfteo Mr.
Perkins, an ardent supporter if IBM President's
administrative policies and a man whose per
sonal integrity baa n«"ver b*-en questioned, was
recognized by the Speaker. He was chosen a*
the best man to perform the duty required, as
his entire record in Congress has been one •<(
Independent thought, fearlessness an.l absolute
disregard of the machine. He arose to a ques
tion of "person.. privilege." and offered the fol
lowing resolution, while th» House awaited thf>>
reading with unsuppress^d curiosity:
Whereas. There was contained In the sundry
civil appropriation bill, which pass<"*i Congress
at its last session and became a law. a provision
in reference to the employment of the Secret
Service In the Treasury Department: and.
Whereas. In the message of the President of
the United St it - to the two houses .>f Congress
it was stated^in reference to that provision: "It
is not too much So say that Ibis amendment i>m
been of benefit only, and could be of benefit only.
f.. the criminal classes." and it was further
stated, "The chief argument hi favor of th^
provision, was that the Congressmen did not
themselves wish to be investigated by Serr<»t
Service-men," and it was further stated, "but If
this is not considered desirable a special excep
tion could b«* made in the law. prohibiting th>»
use of the Secret Service fore." in investigating
members of the Congress. It would b«> far better
to do tins than to do what was actually d-»ne.
an.l strive to prevent, or at least to hamper,
effective action against criminal* by the exeon
tive- branch of the government."
Now. therefore, be it resolved. That a commit
tee of five members of this House b»j»pp<Mnte<l
| by the Speaker to consider tb> statement««~con
tained in the message of th* President and report
to the House what action, if any. should be taken
In reference thereto.
REMARKS OK MB PERKINS
When the reading: end) th»re was not 9
sound from th- Hou<w except th^ slight n<>|s»
mail" by the members as they turned to fact?
Representative Perkins, who said:
I do not believe in oversensitive ness to un
favorable criticism, whether upon an individual
or upon -i public body. Uut v.-;ii!»-> ther<* may b
undue sensitives* - so, also. thTe may b*» ui»
due obtuseness which might <-rgue a lack of
proper self-respect.
It is of importance to the Republic th;it all of
the co-ordinate branches of rli" goiernment
should possess in a high .i»e' ■• the confidence
and respect of the people. I yi-ld t<~> n» one iv
my respect for the Chief Extfcntire of tb»
United States: and I yield to r.-> one In my re
spect for the Congress of the ITnited States. To
the fongress is gpranted great power, and upon
it are Imposed grroat responsibilities. We i-an
not neglect our duties nor shirk our responsi
bilities. The dignity .»f that body should not
be punctiliously insisted upon, but it shou!-i b*
properly maintained. The statements mad* by
the President of the United States cannot b«»
lightly disregarded. They may be so construed
by the public as to lessen the dignity and there
by impair the usefulness of th^ ('onsresa of th«>
United States. It can be justly said. I think, that
these expressions were unfortunate. Whether
it hi enough to say this, or whether some more
formal a_-tion should be taken, it will be for
Congress, exercising a wise and discreet judg
ment, to decide.
We are the representatives of ninety millions
of people. We are the legislative body of a
great nation. I am sure there ■ no one who
has the honor to be a member of this «'ongres»
who will hesitate to approve such action as may
be required by a proper regard for the dignity
of the body to which we belong and of to*
people whose representatives we are.
Just before he pronounced the word "uniorta>
nate." characterizing the President's statement
Mr Perkins paused for a moment as if to think
of a word which would tit the situation. Hi*
colleagues leaned forward in their chairs, real
izing that much of the proceedings which ar*
to follow the resolution would depend lax: oa
the term he used. When "unfortunate' was
spoken there was a sigh of relief, both (M the
President's friends, who believe that if he takes
any notice of the affair it will be to the regret
of the House, and from his enemies, who feel
that "unfortunate" Is as far as it Is wise to go.
The vote was not loud, but most of the Repub
lican members murmured a solemn "aye," whil*
the Democrats swelled the chorus without their
usual enthusiasm. A number of members sur
rounded Mr. Perkins and congratulated him en
his speech, concerning- which nothing but fa
vorable comments were heard, the consensus of
opinion being that It was a conservative, tem
perate utterance.
It is known that such unanimity will not
Kr«-trt th« report of. the committee in rase it
rrcommt-nds the- laying of th«» message on th«
table. Several members have intimated that
they will Insist on a serious Investigation If
such action is rrcommendtd. by the committee.
■to that thurte who have been indulging in vi*>
lent private criticisms may not have an oppor
tunity to claim victor) without a struggle. It
can safely t.^ >.iii! th.it a great number of Re
publicans in the House favor the President's
Secret Service policj . and ti.r- only reason th*t
this was not aß.*erte«l in the House to-day was
due to the fact that the Prrsi»ient seemed en
tirrly unconcerned us t<> what action was taken.
PROBABLE ACTION OF SKNATE

will be taken in th.it body •>!> .Monday, although
it ii'>t yet definitely >ettled whether ■ -.. initia
