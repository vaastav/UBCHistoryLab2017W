An Important Statement--The Slaveholders
Preparing for Emancipation.
A correspondent of the New York
Tribune, writing from the department of
the West, s&js that the Emancipation
Proclamation is already having its effect
in the preparations which the slare owners
of Alabama and Tennessee are making for
their future relations to their slaves.
Many of them have already entered into a
oontraot with their slaves to remain upon
the plantations under vagtt. They have
eame to the conclusion that the slaves are
as necessary to them as it has long been
asserted they were to the slaves. As la
borers, the slaves are essential to the pros-
parity of the South, and no class will be
more opposed to their colonization in a
foreign country, when the war is over, than
their former masters. It has long been
manifest that there was a far greater prej
udice existing sgainst association with
the negro at the North than at the South.
There, the two races have been intimately
connected from childhood, a fact of which
the quadroon and the octoroons are living
witnesses. Hence there will be less social
resistance to them as free persons there
than at the North. The fact that the negro
Is especially adapted to the cultivation of
the Southern soil under the Southern
climate, is perfectly understood by the
master and hence it is that they are ne
gotiating with the Blaves to remain as pud
laborers and do the work to which they
have been accustomed.
Several instances are noticed by the
correspondent, where this arrangement has
been effected. One Mr. Aiken, a cotton
planter of Tennessee, said to him that he
and several of his neighbors" had already
had a talk with their slaves and agreed
with them to remain and receive wages.
They preferred them to any new set of la
borers that they could obtain. They had
advised their slaves to remain and they
were pleased with the arrangement.
Other instances are narrated, sufficient to
show that the movement is spending.
There are, no doubt, many Northern
Democrats who will see, even in this peace
ful negotiation, an "unconstitutional
policy " tut all those who earnestly desire
the welfare of the oppressed of the human
race will see in it one solution of the great
problem "what shall be done with the
laves?"
Departure of General Banks' Expedition.
The military expedition which has been
fitting ont under the command of General
N. P. Banks, sailed from New York on
Thursday, the commander himself taking
passage in the steamer North Star. A part
of the troops to composcJhe force under
this command have been Andetvousing at
Fortress Monroe, and it is supposed
that the Massachusetts troops which lately
ailed from Boston to North Carolina are
also to have a place in this expedition.
On Thursday an excursion was given in
Kew York harbor in honor of General
Banks, at which many distinguished citi
tens were present. A dinner was served
on board, and brief speeches followed. A
patriotic toast complimentary to General
Basks wa followed by three rousing
eheen and a tiger, when the gallant Gen
oral arose and said that he could not but
feel gratified by the honors paid to him
and the scene by which he was surround

Help for English Operatives.
, At a meeting of the New York Chamber
of Commerce held on Thursday, the most
munificent response was made to the call
for help for the starving poor of England.
Messrs. N. L. & Geo. Griswold offered the
free nse of a new ship of 1800 tons to con
vey the supplies free of charge, and their
ervioee, if needed, to forward them to
England, an offer which is valued at not
lest than SLO.OOO. An unknown gentle
man, who signed his offer "Union", gave
one thousand barrels of flour and seven
one-thousand dollar Treasury notes. Other
offers were mode of from five thousand to
one hundred dollars. Subsequently A. T.
Stewart, the dry goods prince, gave $10,
000. New York is pouring out of her
abundance with no stinting hand, and it
will require but a very few days to make
np a losd for the noble ship of the Messrs.
Griswold.

Report of Secretary Chase.
The report of the Secretary of the Treas
ury is very long and full, filling two very
close pages of the New York papers. It is
obviously too long to publish entire in our
eolumns,and we avail ourselves of a synop
sis from the Tribune, of its principal fea
tures. The report is clearly and forcibly
written, and at this period, when the means
of carrying on the war expenses of the
Government are subjects of such vast im
portance, it will be read with an. interest
second only to that given to the President's
Message. The Treasury report has gener
ally been a mere mass of dry statistics,
but at this time every man's pocket is vi
tally interested in the recommendations of
the able head of that bureau.
The Secretary explains why a change of
circumstances may cause estimates to ex
ceed expenditures such as the great in
crease of the army. Disbursements, how
ever, up to the 80th of June, 1862, were al-
most precisely according to the Secretary's
last December estimate : the disbursements
being, in round numbers, 614 million dol
lars, and the estimates 617 millions. The
estimate of debt to be incurred up to the
commencement of July, 1863,is over eleven
hundred millions; and if the war be con
tinued in full force till the 1st of Jul 1
18134, the debt likely to have been then in
curred is set down at seventeen hundred
and fifty-four millions
The Secretary is happy in the statement
whiche can make in regard to the reduc
tion of the cost of the debt, or tbe interest.
The first loans being of such nnusual mag
nitude, were handsomely paid for: but
large amonnts are now obtained at from
four to five per cent- while the circulation
of the C 8. notes continues practically
a loan from the people to the Government,
without interest. The average rate of
loans is thus reduced to 4 per cent. Both
receipts and expenditures will be increased
for the current and following year. Ag
gregate receipts for the fiscal year 100:2,
$583,885,247 06; expenditures, 070,841,-
1 00 2d: balance in Treasury July, 18b 'J,
$13,043,546 91. The actual rcoeipts of the
first quarter of the fiscal year of 1803, com
mencing August 1, 1802, are noted on the
Treasury books; the other three quarters
must be estimated. The one is actually
$37,208,629 62 ; the others estimated $143,-
286,816 63. Loans during first quarter,
$114,458,321 02; and during October and
November, $35,670,895 99. Loans ob
tained up to 1st December, $200,129,71701,
and to be realized probably, ur ker existing
(5ws, in addition, $131,021,197 35 making
the total of receipts under actual and
anticipated laws, $511,646,659 9G.
For the first quarter of the fiscal
year J 003, the actual expenditures
were $111,084,447 40. tor the second,
third and fourth quarters estimated ex
penditures, under existing appropriations,
including interest on public debt, are
$072,843,841 73. Estimates of deficien
cies to be met, $109,413,032 80. Making
the wbole amount actually expended or
estimated, $893,346,321 48. Estimates,
for payment of public debt during the
year, or $3o,zlz,ibb 14; making an ag
gregate for all purposes of $988,563,777
62. It is usual to make an -estimate large
enough to cover all possible requirements
under it until a session of Congress shall
afford an opportunity of providing for any
deficiencies that may thereafter occur.
Hence estimates always largely exceed
expenditures. The appropriations unex
pended, therefore, will lessen the above
sum by $200,000,000, making it $788,
658,777 C2. But of this sum, as already
stated, there has been received, and may
be expected of customs, etc., $180,495,345
60; and loans, $331,150,914 .6. Aggre
gate, to be deducted from actual and an
ticipated expenditure, $511,646,259 96 ;
and leaving to be provided fortbe current
year, $276,912,617 66. The 6coreiry
next oners the conjectural estimates of the
fiscal year 1804, commencing the 1st of
July next. Expenditures: $845,000,000.
Receipts, customs, taxes, Sc., $223,000,-
000. Leaving amount to be provided
for, $622,000,600. Amount needed beyond
resources under existing laws, if war con
tinues, for the fiscal year 1863, $276,000,-
000; for the fiscal year 1864, $622,000,000.
Aggregate: $900,000,000. A tabular state
ment is submitted with the report as a part
of it, giving receipts and expenditures of
financial years of 1862, 1803, and 1864,
Details of debt are also submitted. The
Secretary reviews his recommendations to
Congress to increase duties; by a direct
tax; by internal duties; emit notes; nego
tiate loans, etc. Unexpected military de
lays required further financial operations.
The suspension of specie payment by
banks is treated financially. The Secreta
ry describes the loans made and the course
he took thereupon. He considers the value
of the Treasury-Note system in the present
exigency. $150,000,000 in all have been
emitted. Congress authorized, late in the
session, $150000,000 more; $5(1000,000 of
which were to be reserved from issues un
til actually required for payment of de
posit. Still later, Congress, upon the
recommendation of the Secretary, author
ized a fractional currency. Total author
ized emission, $250,000,000. Sixty millions
received from customs were not available
for circulation, but might be replaced as
paid in by notes of the new issues which
were thus available, so that in the end, a
total circulation of $250,000,000 might be
reached, and on an improbable contintren-
cy increased $50,000,000 more. The Sec
retary recommended and Congress author-
zed the receipt on temporary deposit of
$100,000,000 at 6 percent., and payment
creditors who liked of debt certificates

authorized bonds to the amount of $-300 -000,000,

specie, and redeemable afu i jeara.
They are called live-twenties or five-
twenty sixes. The good results have ex
ceeded the Secretary's expectations. The
Secretary expresses regret that his recom
mendation in regard to a general bank
ing law, etc., were not carried out.
1st July, $08,000,000 on deposit. United
States Notes issued, $158,000,000: S19.-
000,000 paid in certificates of debt; $208,
000,000 in cash. Every call on the Treas
ury answered, and all army business with
promptly executed. Balance in the
Treasury, $13,000,000. Notwithstanding
the unexpected demands on the Treasury.
arising from army reverses, the Secretary
has provided for constantly increasing
disbursements. Payments during the
quarter ending September SO, other than
for the principal of public debt were
$111,000,000; October, $49,000,000; No
vember, $59,000,000. All requisitions be
yond resources, only $19,000,000. ' Power
borrow or gel loans under aot of July,
1001, is exhausted, secretary considers
financial laws. He dues not favor the is
sue of Treasury Notes to pay S276,
000,000 as needed. A limited issue under
certain restrictions might answer. The
Secretary does not believe the present pa
per issues redundant. Stoppage of specie
payments, and rears or ignorant people
abroad throwing stocks into the market,
caused gold to be an object of speculation,
till it reached 87$ per cent. The Secreta
ry treats of the cause of the rise ; not to be
att"buted mainly to increase of currency.
The cause of redundancy is the increase
corporate notes. He recommends a U.
Bank circulation, and the reduction of
the bank-note circulation. Be renews the
proposition to lay a moderate tax on cor
porate circulation, and considers it the
best means of gradual reduction and sub
stitution. The Secretary believes in a
Bound circulation of uniform value,
through banking associations organ
ized under La ional legislation. He
disensses the national resources lands,
mines, &C, ana is nopelul of the fu
tare, Th modo of obtaining the new j
loans is handled. Certain restrictions in
theact authorizing the issue of bonds, he
advises to be taken off. The bullion re
ceived at the Mint last financial year was
$15,000,000. Amount coined gold, $15,-
000,000; silver, near 3,000,000, etc. To
tal coinage, $65,000,000. Bullion depos
ited at Assay Office, N. Y., $26,000. In
San Francisco gold deposited in branch
mint, $16,000,000; silver, $749,000. The
Secretary recommends that the present
demonetisation of gold may be well availed
of for the purpose of taking one consider
able step toward having uniform weights,
measures and coins. vIle recommends that
the half eagle be made equal to the sovereign
of Oreat Britain. He discusses the trade
between the loyal and disloyal States; Cus
tom-House frauds ; the necessity of a N. 1
Assistant Collector; the requirements of
the tt. 1. Custotn-House building; tbe ad
ministration of the hospital fund; the is
sue of stamp currency ; the printing and
engraving of Treasury notes; the labors
of the Bureaus; the property destroyed
through military service ; the appointments
of certain deputies; the inspection of steam
boats; the revenue-cutter service; praises
the coal survey; glances at maps and
charts and lighthouse ; then concludes
without any peroration.
The report it written with a clearness,
force, and elegance of all papers emanat
ing from the distinguished secretary of
the Treasury.
Report of Secretary Chase. From the 67th Regiment.---Expedition
near Suffolk.
[Correspondence Cleveland LEADER.]
HcinqrABTCBS 67tr Ohio, I
SorroLx, Va-f Dec. 3.
As a contrast to the proceedings of soma
high in command of the Army of the West,
permit me to relate a little incident that
occurred near here a few days ago. A free
negro mam by the name of Davis, living
near Smithfield, which is situated on Pa
gan Creek, about five miles from James
river, had committed the heinous crime
(in the estimation of the rebels,) of at dif
ferent times supplying our officers atNew-
port News with sweet potatoes, poultry,
ic, and for this some of his secesh neigh
bors had determined that himself, wife and
child, should be seized and sent to Rich
mond and sold for the benefit of the South
ern Confederacy. Some of Davis' friends,
learning the intentions of bis enemies, ad
vised him to leave immediately, which he
did, coming to this place. On his arrival
here he met with Captain Lee, of the 99th
New York regiment, now in command of
the picket gunboat West End, and related
to him what the rebels contemplated doing
with himself and family. Captain Lee
bad frequently met Davis while patroling
James river and Pagan creek, and knew
him to be an honest, worthy man, and at
once resolved to make an effort to save
him and his family. The plan of the reb
els was to have a squad of cavalry come
from Surrey Court House, which is about
fifteen miles distant, go to Davis' house
about daylight, take him and his family,
and hurry them off to Bichmond as fast as
possible. Saturday morning last was the
supposed time the guerrillas had set to
carry their plan into execution. Captain
Lee immediately applied to ueneral reck
for permission to go with the gunboat and
bring away Davis' family, and if possible
bag the rebel gang. Permission was read
ily given. Captain Lee asked for a detail
of forty picked men and two commissioned
officers to accompany him. The lot fell
upon Captain A. P. Oirty and the writer,
with forty men selected from Company G,
67th Regiment, O. V. I , who upon re
ceiving notice, immediately reported on
board the gunboat. We were very soon
under way, and proceeded down the Nan-
semond river to Uamptoa Roads, up James
river to Pagan creek, where, at about
three o'clock, a. m , we landed, with Davis
for a guide, ne marched about five miles
by a roundabout way, got in the rear of
the town, posted ourselves on the
road leading back into the coun
try, in a position to cut off the retreat
of the guerrillas, and there waited for the
gunboat to come up and commence the at
tack. After remaining there over an hour
and until after daylight, and not hearing
anything from tbe game we were after,
we proceeded through town to the boat,
and while on the way learned by a negro,
to our great chagrin, that we were one
day too late. The rebels had been there the
morning before and finding Davis away
concluded to defer their operations to
another time. Our company proceeded
with Davis to his house and guarded him
and his family with his household effects
to the boat, compelling oue of his white
neighbors to take his team and move the
goods. After paying our respects to some
of the principal secessionists in town and
advising them to be cautious in future, we
got under way on our return, keeping a
close watch -rid examing several places
where it is stfpposed the rebels cross the
river, 'making their way back and fjrth
through our lines. The promptness with
wbich'Capuin Lee planned and executed
this expedition is worthy the notice of his
superiors in command. Cap'in l ia an

rebel- had evacuated this place. He is
every way competent and worthy to com

While on the expedition I was a close
observer, but saw nothing to impress me
favorably with the country or inhabitants
The prominent men of the village were
tnmeaiu. and. well informed. They con
versed freely upon the war. "They were
all sanguine of their success, but all ex
pressed a hope that the war would soon
end. They acknowledged that it had
ruined their business and made paupers of
thousands who but a short time ago were
regarded as wealthy. The common class
are far below the niedioericy of the North
ern people in regard to intelligence. Their
farms are old and worn out, buildings
poor and fast going to decay. Everything
indicates that tbe inhabitants lack intelli
gence, industry and energy. As an illus
tration of the ignorance of the inhab
itants of this country, I am informed by
the clerk of the Provost Marshal that he
had examined one hundred names of per
sons applying for passes to pass in and out
Of our lines, and found that thirty-one

pelled to make their mark. If Slavery is
not the cause of this ignorance, what is ?
