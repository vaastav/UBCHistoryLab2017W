Low Meat Prices
vs.
High Cattle Prices
If the farmer cannot get enough for
his live stock, he raises less, and the
packer gets less raw material.
If the consumer has to pay too much
for his meat, he eats less of it, and the
packer finds his market decreased.
The packer wants the, producer to
get enough to make live-stock raising
profitable, and he wants the price of meat
so low that everyone will eat it.
But aU he can do, and what lie would
have to do in any case to stay in busi
ness, is to keep down the cost of pro
cessing the former's stock into meat so
that the consumer pays for the meat and
by-produ ts only a little more than the
former gets for his animals.
For example, last year Swift & Company
paid for its cattle about 90 per cent of
what it got for meat and by-products
(such as hides, tallow, oils, etc.)
If cattle from the farm were turned
miraculously into meat in the hands of
retailed (without going through the ex
pense of dressing, Shipping and market
ing')* the former would get only about
1% cents per pound more for his cattle,
or consumers would pay only afrrat 2^4
cents per pound less for their beef 1
Out of this cent or two per pound,
Swift ft Company pays for the operation
of extensive plants, pays freight on meats»
operates refrigerator cars, maintajnft
branch houses, and in most cases, de
livers to retailers all over the United
States. The profit amounts to only a
fraction of a cent, and a part of this
profit goes to build more plants to give
better service, and to increase the com
pany's usefulness to the country.
