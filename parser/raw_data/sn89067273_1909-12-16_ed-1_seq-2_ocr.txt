Erie. Pa. With her Cag at half
mast, the state fisheries boat. Com
modore Perry, Capt. Gerry Drlscoll
commanding, brought to this part the
frozen bodies of nine of the crew
of the Bessemer nnd Marquette ferry
No. 2. which left Conneaut, Ohio, Tues
day morning, carrying thirty-two men
and which has probably foundered lu.
the middle of Lt.ke Erie.
For forty-eight hours Commodore
Perry has been searching the waters
of Eastern Lake Erie for traces of the
car ferry, but until a tiny ten-man
yawl was sighted fifteen miles off this
port, the men on the little state fish
eries craft had almost given up hope
of being able to ever tell even a
portion of tho story of the fate of the
big car ferry.
As the lookout on the Perry sighted
a tiny half-sunken yawl at about noon
orders were given to steam down up
on the object. The use of glasses dis
covered the boat to be loaded with
nine men.
Arrived To Late.
As the Perry came abreast of the
drifting and half water-logKed yawl,
the men gathered at the side of the
fish boat saw that they arrived too
ate. The nine occupants of the boat.
which was marktl "Bessemer and
Marquette No. 4," were frozen stiff.
Taking the yawl In tow, the Perry
made all steam for this port.
Capt. Johnson of the life-saving sta
tion of this port, had already Bighted
the fish boat and tow and making out
the contents of the yawl, had notified
the Erie chief of police, from Presquo
'eninsula. who in turn notified the
coroner. All police reserves were cal
led out and ambulances lined the
wharves as the Perry docked.
News of the finding of the bodies
bad reached the city and thousands of
persons swarmed to the wharves. As
soon as the fish boat made fast a
force of men with tackle set to work
raising the bodies of the men to the
dock, where wagons were In watlng.
The procession of dead passed through
the principal streets of the city, with
hundreds of people following.
Conneaut, Ohio, where most of the
men lived, was notified by telephone
of the grewsome find, and a hundred
residents of that city arrived here
within two hours. They were taken
directly to the coroner's morgue,
where Identifications were made.
Only One Had Overcoat.
The cook of the car ferry was the
only man to wear an overcoat. The
eight other men were dressed in over
alls and Jumpers, indicating that the
departure from the car ferry had been
hurried. In the bow end of the boat
was found complete clothing for one
man, and it is the belief that the
yawl orglnally contained ten man,
and fhat one becoming crazed, dis
carded his clothing and Jumped into
the Icy waters of Lake Erie.

CUMMINS INTRODUCES MEASURE
PRACTICALLY SUPPLANTING
INTERSTATE COMMERCE ACT.
ELKifiS WILL ALSO SUBMIT BILL
Iowa Senator Advocates Uniform
Classification for Freight Ship-,
ments Plan for Stock
Payment at Par.
Washington. D. C. A contro-
rersy over railroad legislation will be
precipitated in congress this winter,
which, in importance, promises to
surpass the legislative conflict over
railroad rates four years ago.
The first gun was fired by Senator
Cummins of Iowa when he produced
a bill proposing radical changes in
the interstate commerce act. In a
large sense the Cummins measure is
a substitute for the present Interstate
commerce act
It is expected that a measure pro
posing amendments to the law will be
introduced early In January $y Sen
ator El kins, which will differ from the
Cummins bill in many important de
tails.
Uniform Classes Provided.
In brief, the Cummins bill requires
the interstate commerce commission
to promulgate a uniform classification
of freight, and to prepare a plan or
the statement of freight rates which
shall hereafter be made in a uniform
way. The carriers are required to
adopt this classification.
The commission Is authorized to
consider rates on its own motion with
a view to determine their reason
ableness, and is empowered to ftx
maximum and minimum rates.
In any action instituted in court to
set aside an order of the commission
respecting the rates, the courts are
prevented from inquiring into the rea
sonableness or sufficiency of any rate
fixed by the commission.
The bill provides that changes in
rates shall not become effective until
they are approved by the commission.
It prohibits the acquisition of control
by any common carrier of any paral
lel competing line, or from acquiring
the capital stock or bonds of any oth
er carrier which is a competitor.
By tho terms of the bill a carrier is
prohibited from Issuing any capital
stock without payment in par, either
in money or in property and, in effect,
the commission shall have supervision
of the issues of stocks and bonds by
any carrier. Specific directions are
given for the disposition of the pro
ceeds of any sale of bonds.
After January 1, 1911, no carrier do
ing Interstate business shall be per
mitted to engage in any other busi
ness than that of a common carrier.

CONGRESSIONAL
At the White House a conference
was held which has an important
bearing upon the legislative program
for the present session of the pres
ent congress. Vice-President Sher
man and Speaker Cannon were called
In by the president, and they sent
more than an hour in consultation. It
was learned that before he sent his
message to congress President Taft
sent a copy to Speaker Cannon and
told him that he would like to talk
over with him some of the features,
especially that In relation to amend
ments to the interstate commerce law.
The speaker responded, and Mr. Sher
man, who presides over the senate,
was also invited. The political sig
nificance of the conference is given
as the president's desire to get the
factions of the party to agree upon
taking up some one piece of legisla
tion and act upon it harmoniously.
The amendments to the interstate
commerce act are regarded as one
subject upon which this can be
brought about, and it seems now that
that will be the Important business
of the present session. It is believed
that both the "progressives" in the
senate and the "insurgents" in the
house will agree to that statement,
and will be willing to act harmoni
ously with the regulars of the Repub
lican party. Even the Democrats, it
is believed, will be glad to take up
consideration of this matter.
A shocking story of the white slave
traffic, its widespread influence, its
degredatlon and its misery, is told

has had agents Investigating the prob

1907.
A drastic proposition to meet the
strike of the switchman on the rail
road lines entering St. Paul is made
In a bill, amending the Erdman act,
which will be introduced by Repre
sentative Steenerson of Minnesota,
providing for receiverships of the
roads involved, If necessary. The bill
gives United States courts full Juris
diction. It also amends the Erdman
law so as to allow the courts to fix
the compensation of members of the
arbitration boards in cases of unusual
importance.
One of the striking features of the
the house proceedings was a speech
by Representative Kuestermann of
Wisconsin, denying the charge that
his interest in German shipping was
so great as to cause him to antagon
ize a bill for the relief of the Ameri
can merchant marine. Mr. Kuester
man was in jovial humor and bis
speech was generally enjoyed.
A bill evidently designed to cover
cases of contempt of court similar to
that of President Oompers and his as
sociates of the American Federation
of Labor and greatly restricting the
power of the courts in such cases was
introduced in the house by Repre
sentative Thomas of Kentucky.
Representative Alexander of Mis
souri la sponser for a bill Introduced
in the house which is intended to ex
tend the provisions of the federal

Missouri militia and the several other

similar bill to Include the militia or
ganizations of all the states was also
introduced by Mr. Alexander.

lution by Senator Raynor authoriz
ing the president of the United States
to cause President Zolaya to be ap
prehended as a common criminal,
charged with the murder of two Am
ericans, engaged in revolutionary act
ivity in Nicaragua, contrary to the
code of all civilized nations, which
would have granted them a trial.
Representative Barthold of St.
Louis Introduced a bill in the house
having for ita purpose the relief of
the farmers living in Columbia bot
toms, affected by a government dam.
KENTUCKY KIDNAP
CASE DEFY POLICE
FATHER OF ALMA KELLNER SAYS
8HE WAS STOLEN WHILE
LOOKING AT TOYS.
WOMAN IS BUCK SUSPECTED
Child Believed to Have Been Taken
for Heiress Various Clues Traced
by Police Fall to Disclose
Whereabouts of Girl.
Louisville, Ky. Though story after
story has been investigated by tho
Louisville police, the whereabouts of
8-year-old Alma Kellner, who disap
peared from her home Wednesday
morning, remains a mystery.
F. L. Kellner, father of Alma, said
that he believed his daughter waa
looking at toys in the shop windows
on Walnut street, when, as he expres
sed it, "somebody nailed her." He said
the child made friends with Btrangers
In a quick, responsive way and that
after she had attended church, for
which purpose she left home, she waa
wandering among the Christmas dis
plays, when she was kidnaped.
Meanwhile children resembling
Alma Kellner, have been sympatheti
cally reported to have been seen be
ing forced into covered carriages by
veiled women, roughly dressed, and
the like, observed walking up and
down street-car aisles, hurried into
Tell City, Ind., where an allegedly dis
gruntled relative of the Kellners is
supposed to live; while another
story is that Alma was mistaken for
her 11-year-old aunt, Meta Kellner, an
heiress, whom Alma resembles.
The city has distributed . 500 cir
culars offering an unspecified reward
for the return of the child and the en
tire police force of Louisville and
Southern Indiana towns are busy upon
the case.
Frank Fahr, millionaire brewer, and
uncle of the missing child, said Fri
day that F. L. Kellner was not in a
position to pay a ransom for Alma,
and that, while F. L. Kellner Sr. had
been a rich man, the Junior's share
would not amount to anything con
siderable. The family specifically
denied a rumor published that a
meeting of Mrs. Kellner and the kid
napers had been arranged.
One of those "mysterious women in
black," who usually figure in cases
of the Kellner kind, was discovered
zy reporters in the vicinity of the
home of Mrs. F. L. Kellner Sr., and
her actions excited suspicion. The
police who-have searched in vain
every vault, empty house and alley in
a readius of half a mile of the Kell
ner home, devcted their attentions to
watching this woman and to running
down the story of an aged Russslon
peddler, who said he had seen In
Southern Indiana a girl who might
have been Alma, traveling toward
Madison, Ind., and Cincinnati, with a
man in a wagon.
