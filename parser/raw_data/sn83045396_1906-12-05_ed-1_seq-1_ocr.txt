!
Special to The Tribune.
LAHAMIK, Wyo., Dec. 4. E. Wil
letts, a stockman from Idaho, enroutc
East with stock, fell from a car in the
cars at Jtawlino last night, and when
picked up by yardmen this morning
died in a few minutes. Ho wns uncon
scious from the injurier and exposure
and unable to give any account of the
accident. .
Rev. Oscar Woods of this city this
afternoon in an articlo in a local pa
per bitterly denounced tho socalled
endless prayer chain letters, several of
which have been received here. One
young woman of a very religious turn
of mind was so wrought up about the
matter as to be in a serious mental
condition. Rev. Woods advises that all
letters received bo burned and no re
plies sent. The letters carry a promise
of some grcatblcssinc to all who will
on nino succcssivo days .copy tho
prnvcr and mail it to nine friends. The
letters arc signed "A Friend."
CASE OF CARUSO
Appeal of Noted Tenor Singer Is to Be
Heard Soon."
NEW YORK, Dec. A Magistrate
Baker yesterday made his return to
the order of Judge 0 'Sullivan of the
Court of General Sessions in the case
of Signor Enrico Caruso, the Metro
politan opera-house tenor who was
fined $10 for annoying a woman at the
monkev-house in tho Central park. It
is likely that the appeal will be hoard
some time this week, as Judge Ditten
hocfer, Caruso's counsel, is anxious for
a decision as soon ns possible.
Patrolman J. J. Cain, who hns for
3'cars been on duty in the park, and
who while there arrested Caruso near
the monkev-house, was transferred to
the One "Hundred and Fifty-second
street station, known among the police
as the "goat district."
This transfer would have excited
more comment had it not been the re
sult of Commissioner Bingham 's recent
order that all plain clothes men should
be shifted every thirty days.
Police Commissioner Bingham did not
learn of Cain's removal until last night,
lie said then that ho would order
I Cain back to duty in the park as the
transfer might be misconstrued.

Protective association made a speech
to the.-500 or more women, men and
children, in which he told, them that
the high prices were all due to the
pnckeis and entreated them not to
force the butchers out of business.
So disorderly did the meeting be
come during his speech that a spec
tator sent in a call for the police.
When order had been restored reso
lutions were adopted recommending a
strict boycott of the Harlem kosher
butchers, Tho police expect trouble
and will watch tho meat shops closely

INTERESTING SESSION
Constitutional Convention of Oklahoma
Discusses Church and State.
GUTHRIE. Okla., Dec. 4. From the
atandpoliu of the gallery. today was
probably the most Interesting of the ses
sions of the Constitutional convention. Bv
far the most sensational feature was the
resolution presented by an Oklahoma del
egate calling on the convention to draft
a law maintaining the Intllvldualltv of
the church and State. The original reso
lution wns a practical embodiment of a
similar memorial from the Seventh Day
Adventlsts. The latter Is elgnod by SOOO
voters and asks thai no reference be
made In the Constitution to any day to
be fet aside for public worship, These
resolutions were referred to committees.
I-orty new planks were proposed during
tho day The most Important are those
declaring the new State to favor an
amendment to the Federal Constitution
providing for an Income tax and allowing
the delegates to name county lines.
ceiving legal notice of this action, Mr.
Laiigton reported to t he oflico of the
Justice, accompanied by Attorney Neb
ckcr, and asked for two days in which
to plead. The case is set for Thursday,
at - p. in.

I
SHOULD STRIKE AT POLYGAMY
I am well aware of how difficult it is to pass a constitutional amendment. Nevertheless,
in iny judgment, the whole question of marriage and divorce should be relegated to the au
thority of the National Congress. At present the wide difference in the laws of the different
States on this subject result in scandals and abuses: and surely there is nothing so vitally
essential to the welfare of the Nation, nothing around which the Nation should so bend itself
to throw every safeguard, as the home life of the average citizen. The change would be good
from every standpoint. In particular it would he good because it would confer on the Con
gress the power at once to deal radically and efficiently with polygamy: and this should be
done whether or not marriage and divorce are dealth with. It is neither safe nor proper to
leave the question of polygamy to l)e dealt with by the several States. Power to deal with it
should be conferred on the National Government.
When home ties are loosened; when men and women coase to regard a worthy family life, with all its
duties fully performed, and all its responsibilities lived up to. as the life best worth living, then evil
days for tho commonwealth are at. hand. There are regions in our land, and classes of our population,
where tho birth rate has sunk below the death rate. Surely it should need no demonstration to show
that willful sterility is, from tho standpoint of the Nation, from the standpoint of tho human raco,
the ono sin for which the penalty is National death, race death; a sin for which there is no atone
ment; a sin which Is the moro dreadful exactly in proportion as tho men and women guilty thereof are
in other rospects, in character, and bodily montal powers, those whom for the sake of tho State it would
be woll to sco the fathers and mothers of many healthy children, well brought up in homes mado happy
by thoir presence, No man, no woman, can shirk the primary duties of life, whether for love of ease
and pleasure, or for any other cause, and retain his or hor self-respect.
I PLENTY OF ROOM FOR MORE I
Property owners should not fall into tho error of believing that because there are to be several sky-scrapers
erected here right away there will be no need for moro.
The fact must bo borne in mind that already thoro is a positively distressing inability to meet tho de
mand for store-rooms and office-quarters, and that Salt Lake has only just begun to grow. Before the buildings
now in contemplation can bo half completed every foot of space in them will bo forespoken, and the cry will
bo for still moro room.
There arc many pieces of good business property which are now burdenod with non-productivo shacks, and
these constituto ideal sites for splendid modern and paying business structures.
No landowner In Salt Lake should be afraid to improve his property. Tho town Is growing faster than
most people think it is, and the continuation and increase of that advancement is assured in the most decisive
way. There Is not a single mushroom indication in the progress which this town is making it Is merely the
result of an awakening of tho great resources available for its maintenance and of the investment of millions
of monoy for the town's upbuilding.
Bailroad men are wise in tho ways of the business world, and you can bank on it that where thoy au
thorize the expenditure of millions for improvements there is something besides "hot air" abounding in that
locality.
This is no fictitious, falsely-inflating boom that is on in this city; it Is the solid, permanent and amply
supported growth of a Groat Amorlcan Salt Lake.
So down with the shacks and up with the. sky-scrapers I

ACTS VERY QUEERLY AFTER

NEW YOKK, Dec. 4. Terence Mc
