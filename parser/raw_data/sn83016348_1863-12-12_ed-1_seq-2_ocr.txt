The Thanksgiving Sermon of Rev. W.
K. England, which we devote tho out side of
Ttu Whig to, will be found breathiiig the purest
patriotism, while placing a firm and unshaken
reliance in the Giver cf every good and perfect
gift, for the triumphant success of the right and
the overthrow of this iniquitous and blood stain
ed rebellion. Had the professing ministers of
the Gospel followed their Divine Master’s pre
cepts, as Mr. England lias done, and not turned
aside, as, til as! so many have, to follow alter
the great harlot rebel lion and slavery, tho pres,
cut reign of Satan in the Southern States would
iiovo r have been. \\ c comuiciid iho sermon us
c.n effort in the cause of the Union. alike worthy
of the exalted piety and patriotism of the preach
er, and ol ike {. much which has been' such a
sheet anchor to the cause, of popular government,
and enemy to rebellion and revolt in our State.
V e regret that our apace would not allow us
to give tho sermon entire in tho present issue.
The conclusion will be. printed next week.
The X’residenrg Message.
The Message was given to Congress on Wed
nesday last. The document opens with a brief
reference to I\.reign Relations, expressing satis
faction at the present amicable state w hich now
exists between tho Government of the Coiled
Nates and Foreign Towers. Tho British Gov
ernment has exercised its authority to prevent
the dcparluv'; of new hostile expeditious from
its ports. The Emperor of TTuuee, has by a
like proceeding promptly vindicated the neu
trality which he proclaimed at the beginning of
the content.
There is reason to believe that many natural
ized citizens have evaded military duty by de
nying the fact of iheir naturalization, und thus
throwing the burthen ol proof upon the Govern
ment. U is, also, believed that foreigners fre
quently become citizens of the United States for
the purpo.-e of evading duties imposed by the
laws ol theii native country, to which on being
naturalized here they repair, and though never re
turning to the United Stales, they still claim the
interrio.sition ol this Government as citizens.—
The President suggestn that, on account of this
abuse, it might be advisable to lix a limit be
yond which no citizen of the United Nates, re
siding abroad may claim tho in tup cordon of Lis
Government.
Satisfactory arrangements have been made
with the Emperor nl Russia which it is hoped
will result i<i effecting a continuous line of telo
gmpli through that enqiiie from our Pacific
coast. The subject of a telegraph across the
Atlantic Ocean, and also between the capital and
tin* national !• oris along the Atlantic seaboard
ami the Gud of Mexico, is recommended fo the
consideration ol Congress. A system for the
fiicor.mgeiiiem of emigration, is also, recom
mended. \v idle the demand for labor is iu
creased m-n*. tensed thousands of persons are
thr*ngu*g .-:r i-veign cunsuhiles, and oifering
to emitrratf i* the United sivcr, it r-sonlin!,
but very clienp assistance can bn afforded them.
i ho ojv. rations of the Treasury during the
lari year have* been successfully conducted.
Ali demands on the treasury, including
the pay of the Army And navy, have been
promptly nut and fully Sulisusg!; .No con
eiberabk; body of troop;, it in believed, were
ever more amply provided and more liberally'
and punctually paid, and it may be added
that by no people were the burdens incident |
Umi great war ever more cheerfully borne.
Tiie receipts during the year from nil
sources, including loans and the balance in
the J reasury at its commencement, were
the aggregate disbur.smcnis
$80.,790,039.65, leaving a balance on tho
Ist ol duly, 1863, of $5,329,011.21.
Gl the receipts there were derived from
Customs. £G‘.us:mH2‘ 40: from Internal Kev
eiiue, J!*:.’ i ,640,78< .'.'b; from direct l uxes,
$1,485,103.61; Irwin J amis, £107,017.17;
from miscellaneous sources, $004,001,53d;
and Infill Loans, $776,682,301,57. making
the aggregate $301,125,671.86,
t Ol the disbursements there were, for the
civil service, $23*253,022; for pensions and
Indians, $1.216,2*.().5U; for interest on pub
lic debt, $21,72.*,810.51; for the War De
partment, $599,298, Gu0.83; for the Navy
Department, 8G3,211,100.1:7; for payment
of funded and temporary debt’ sJß],oß6‘-
635.07; making the aggregate $805,706,63-
IhGo, and leaving the oaiance of $5,820,01-
4.21.
Rut the payments of the funded and tem
porary debt having been made from moneys
borrowed during the year, must be regarded
as merely nominal payments, and* the
moneys borrowed to make them as merely
nominal receipts, and their amount, £ls,
108.Gnd.oU, should therefore, be deducted
both from the receipts and disbursements
ibis being done, there remains as actual
receipts £ • 20,0dd. 70, and the actual disbur
sements £714,7u0,035.58, leaving the balance
us already stated.
it is co i) fid only expected that at the close
ol the year both disbursements and debts
will pe found very considerably less than
has been anticipated.
hor information in the War Department
the President refers to the reports of the
Secretary of War.
I he duties devolving on the naval branch
of tho service during ihe year and through*
out tiie whole ol this unhappy.contest have
been discharged with fidelity and eminent
etmeosp.
1 he extensive blockade has been constan
tly increasing in efficiency us the Navy has
expanded, yet on so long a line it has so far
bm u impossible to entirely suppress illicit I
trade.
f rom the returns received at the Navy j
Department, it appears that more than one |
thouvami vessels have been captured since
the blockade was instituted, and that the
value of prizes already sent in for adjudica
livii amounis to over $13,090,000.
The naval force of the United States con
sifts at this lime of 588 vessels completed
and in the course of completion, and of
those Vo are iron-clad or armored steamers.
1 he armored vessels in our navy comple
ted and in service, or which are under con
tract and approaching completion, are be
lieved to exceed in number those of any
other power ; but while these may be relied
upon for harbor defense and coast service,
others of greater strength and capacity will !
be necessary for cruising purposes, and to i
maintain our rightful position on the ocean, j
Tho change that has taken place in naval j
vessel? and naval warfare since tho intro- *
Ruction of steam as a motive power fur
ships of war, demands either a correspond
ing change in Romo of our existing Navy
Varda, or the establishment of new ones for
the construction and necessary repairs of’
modern oavul vuy.- ■■els. No inconsiderable
emburraesment, delay and public injury j
have been experienced from the want of !
tuck Government establishments.
Jho increase of the number pf seamen
in tho public service from 76*Kt men from 1
the rpring of 18*51. to at out 34,0*50 t the
piesenf time., has been accomplished with
out special legislation or extraordinary
panties, fr. proutoie that increase, it hits
7 T =
been fonnd, however, that the operations of
(be draft, with.lhe high -bounties paid for
a? my recruits, is beginning to affect injuri
ously the naval service and will, if not
corrected, be likely to impair its efficiency
by detaching seamen from their proper vo*
cation, and inducing them to enter the army.
J no President, therefore suggests that Con
gress might aid both tho army and naval servi
ces by a definite provison on this subject, which
would at tho same lime be equitable to the com
munities nmre especially interested.
pining the past fiscal year the financial con
dition of tho Post Office Department has been
one of increasing prosperity; the actual postal
revenue has nearly equaled the entire expendi
tures. the hitler amounting to eleven millions 3
hundred and fourteen thousand two hundred
and six dollars and eighty-four cents, and the
former to eleven million, one bundled and sixty
three thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine
dollars and fifty-nine cents, leaving a deficiency
ol but $ 150,417.8 b. Ju 18GU, tho \car immedi
ately preceding the Rebellion, lb© deficiency
amounted to $5,656,705.4b, the postal receipts
of that year being $2,645,722.10 less than those
of 1863.
The quantity of land disposed of during the
last and the first quarter of the present fiscal
year, was 3.841,549 acres, of which 161,911
j acres were sold for cash, 1.45C..&14 acres weie
taken up under the homestead law, and the res
idue disposed of under laws granting lauds for
military bounties, for railroad and other purpo
ses. \t also appears that the sale of the public
lands is largely on the increase* It has long
been a cherished opinion of some of our wisest
statesmen that the people of the United States
had a higher and more enduring interest in the
early settlement und substantial cultivation of
the public lands, than in the amount of direct
revenue to bo derived from the sale of them.
When Congress assembled a year ago the war
had already lasted nearly twenty months, and
there had been many conflicts on both laud and
sea, with varying results. Tho Rebellion bad
been pressed buck into reduced limits, yet the
tone of public feeling and opinion ut home and
abroad w as nut satisfactory.
With other .signs, the populor elections then
just passed indicated uneasiness among our
selves ; while, amid much that. was cold and |
menacing, the kindest words coming from Eu
rope were uttered in accents of pity that we
vveiw too blind to surrender. Our commerce
was suffering greatly by a few armed vessels
built upon and furnished fjoin foreign shores,
and wo were threatened with such additions
from the same quarter as would sweep our trade
from the sea and raise our blockade. We bad
failed to e ci. fro.a European Governments
anything hopeful upon this .subject.
The preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, 1
which was issued in Soul ember, was running !
its assigned noriod to the Beginning of tb*> uew
year; a month later the final proclamation eauio,
including the announcement that cooled men
offciiitablo condition would be received into the
war sen ice.
1 Die policy of emancipation and of employing
biUjk soldiers gave to the future a new aspect,
about which hope aud fear and doubt cvinendcd
in uncertain conffict.
According to uur political system, ns a matter
of civil administration, the general Government
had no lawiul power ro effect emancipation in
any States, and for a long time it had been hoped
that the Rebellion could bo suppressed without
resorting to it as u military m a* ire.
It \vus all the while deemed possible that the
necessity for it might come, and that if it should,
the crisis of the c ute t would then be pre.souti.-d.
It came, and as was portended, U was followed
by da k and doubtful days.
Eleven months having now passed, we are
permitted to take am ti er rev iow. The Rebel
borders are pressed still further buck, and by
the complete opening of the Mississippi river
the country dominated over by the Rebellion is
divided into distant purls, with no practical com
munication between them. Tennessee and Ar
j Kansas have been substantially* cleared of insur
gent control and intluonce, and the citizens in
each, owners of slave- and advocates of slavery
at tin* beginning of the Rebellion, now declare
openly lor emancipation in their respective
•States. Of those Nates not included in the
emancipation Proclamation, Maryland and Mis
souri, neither of which, throe years ago. would
tolerate any restraint upon the extension of sla
very iuto tiie new territories, only dispute now
as to the best mode of removing it within their
own limits
Of those who wore slaves at the beginning of
the Rebellion, full one hundred thousand Hie
now in the United .States military service, about
one-half of which number actually bear arms in
>he ranks, thus giving the double advantage of
taking so much labor from the Insurgent can*©,
and supplying the places which otherwise must 1
. he filled with son.any white men. So far as
tested, it is difficult to soy that they are not as
good soldiers us any. No servile insurrection or
tendency to violence or cruelty Las uidr , '*’J tho
measures oi cumm *pd loti tlnd arming the black.*
These mommies Lave been much discussed in
foreign countries, and cotcmporury with sin h
discussion the tone of public cmimem there is
much improved. At home the same measures
have been fully discussed, supported, criticised,
and denounced; and the annual elections follow
ing arc highly encouraging to those whose offi
cial duty h is to bear the country through this
gieat ti’rtl.
Thus we liave the new' reckoning. The crisis
which ilin-ftteued to ditide the ntends oi ihe
L’uiou is pu;t.
METHOD OF RECONSTRUCTING THE UNION.
Looking now to the present nnd future,
and with reference to a resumption of the
national authority within the States wherein
that authority has boon suspended, I have
thought tit to issue a proclamation, a copy
of which is herewith tiansimtted. On ex
amination of this proclamation it will ap
pear as is believed that nothing is attempted
beyond what is amply justified by the Con
stitution. True, the form of an oatii is
given, but no man is coerced to take it. A
man ia only promised a pardon in case he
voluntairily takes the oath. Tho Constitu
tion authorizes the Executive to gran‘ or
withhold the pardon at his own absolute dis
ci elion, and nils includes the power to grant
on such terms as are fully established by
judicial and othe r authorities.
It is also proffered that if in any of the
Slates named a State'Govern ttieitf &h.*itl be
recognized nnd guarantied by the United
States, and that under it the Slate shall, on i
the constitutional conditions, be protected 1
against invasion and domestic violence.
'ihe constitutional obligation of the Uni
ted Stales to guarantee to every State in the
Union a Republican form of Government
and to protect tiie State in the cases stated,
is explicit and full. Rut why tender the
benefits of thi*j provision only to a Slate
Government set up in this particular way ?
This section of the Constitution contempla
tes a case wherein the element within a
State favorable to u Republican form of
Government in the Union may he too feeble
for an opposite and hostile element, exter
nal to and even within the State ; and such
i are precisely the cases with which we are
i now dealing.
j An attempt to guarantee and protect a
I revised State Government constructed in
whole or in preponderating part from the
very element against whoso hostility and
viuience it is to Bo protected, is simply ab
surd. There must be a L*>t .by which to
separate the opposing elements so us to
build only from the sound ; and that tost is
a sufficiently liberal one which accepts as
sound whoever will make a sworn rccanta*
tion of his former ansoumlnebs.
But if it bo proper to require as a test of
admission to the political body an oath of
allegiance to the Constitution of the United
Stales, and to the Union under it, why not
also to the laws and proclamations in regard
<to slavery? Those laws and proclamations
i wore enacted and put forth tor the purpose
I of aiding in the suppression of the Rebel
j Hon. f logive them their fullest effect there
' bad to be a pledge for their maintenance. —
In my judgment they have aided and will
further aid the cause for which they were
enlisted.
To give up this principle would be not
’’ only to relinquish a lever of power, but
would also be u cruel and astounding broach
iof faith. 1 may add at this point that while
! I remain in my present position I shall not
1 attempt to retract or modify the Emancipa
tion Proclamation,
j Nor shall 1 return to slavery any person
; who is free by the terms of tho Proclatua
: tic-n or by any act of Congress.
I For these and other reasons it is thought
>' L ett thfit the support of '.hesc mcu'jjrvs -
• i
shall b© included iu the oath, ond it is be*
• Raved the Executive may lawfully claim it
in return for pardon and restoration of for
: feited rights which he has a clear constitu
tional power to withhold altogether or grant
upon the terms which he ahull deem wisest
for the public interest.
It should be observed, also, that this part
of the oath is subject to the modifying and
> ttbroga.iug power of legislation, and au
; preme judicial decision.
The proposed acquiescence of the Nation
- a1 Executive in any reasonable and tempo
-1 rary State arrangement for the freed peo
-1 pie, is made with the view on possibly mod
ifying the confusion and destitution which
j must at best attend all classes by a total re
( volution on labor throughout the whole
I States. It is hoped that the already afflicted
j j people in thou© States may be somewhat
I mqrc ready to give up the cause of their
. affliction, if, to this extent, this vital mat
ter be left to themselves, while no power
i of the National Executive to prevent an
, abuse is abridged by the proposition.
The suggestion in the proclamation as to
maintaining the political framework of the
i Stares on what was called reconstruction,
is made in the hope that it may do good
i without the danger of harm. It will save
labor and avoid great confusion.
But why any proclamation now upon the
subject? This question is beset by the con
flicting views that the step might be delayed
too long or be taken too soon. In some
States the elements of resumption seem
ready for action, but remain inactive appa
rently lor want of u rallying point, a plan
of action.
Why shall A adopt the plan of 3 rather
than B that of A? And if A and B
should agree, how cun they know but that
the General Government here Mill reject
their plan ? By the proclamation u plan is
presented which may be accepted by them
as a rallying point, and which tney are as
sured iu advance will not be rejected hero.
This may bring them to act sooner than
they otherwise would.
I 'ihe objection to a premature presentation
of a plan by the National Executive con
sists in the danger of committals on points
which could be more surely lett to further
developments. Cure lias been taken to so
shape the document as to avoid embarrass
ment from this source.
In saying that on certain terms certain
classes *‘ill be pardoned with their rights
restored, it is nut said that other classes on
other terms will never be included. In say*
• ing chut a reconstruction will be accepted if
presented in a specified way, it is not said
that it will not be accepted in any other way
The movements, by State action, for
| emancipation m several of the States not
included in the Emancipation Proclamation,
. arc matters of profound gratulalion. And
while I do not repeat in detail what 1 have
| heretofore so earnestly urged upon this sub
ject. my general views and feelings remain
unchanged, and 1 trust that Congress will
[ omit no fair opportunity of aiding these
i important steps to the great consummation.
[ In the midst of oilier cares, however iin -
, portant, we must not lose sight of the fact
that the war power is still our main reli
> ance j to that power alone can we look, yet
, tor a time, to give confidence to the people
■ in the contested regions that the insurgent
1 power will not again overrun them. I util
that confidence shall be established, little
' can be done anywhere for what is called
Reconstruction > hence, our chiefest cure
must still be directed to the army und navy,
who have thus far borne their
1 so nobly and so well ; and it may be es
teemed fortunate that in giving the greatest
efficiency to those indispc-nsible arms, we !
| honestly recognize the gallent men, from
commander to sentinel, who compose them,
more than to others, the world must stand
. indebted for the home of freedom, disen
thralled regenerated, enlarged and perpel
. nated. ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

Meet in 5 of Congress,
The Thirty-eighth Congress commenced
its first session on Monday. Vice President
Hamlin called the Senate to order at noon,
and, after prayer by the Chaplain, the body
‘ proceeded to business. Mr. Lane, of In
diana, gave notice that he would introduce
’ a bill during the session for the repeal of
tho throe hundred dollar commutation fea
ture of tlie Enrolment act, and also a bill to
! increase the pay of non-commissioned offi
( cers and privates in the army fifty per cent.,
when the senate adjourned to meet this
;;;orniu£.
Tho House of Representatives also met
on Monday at noon, und upon the Clerk,
Mr. Etheridge, culling the roil of members,
it was ascertained that the names ot the
Representatives from Maryland, Virginia,
Missouri. West Virginia and Kansas had
been omitted b> him, on the ground that
their credentials did not specifically state*
that they were circled in *‘ accordance w ith
the laws of their rt'pectivo Slates of ihe
United Slates.” The exclusion of the
members whose certificates were alleged to
have been imperfect would have given the
Opposition a majority, and thus enable them
lo elect their candidate lor Speaker, which
is supposed to have been the object aimed
at. After considerable discussion, and the
reading of the Act of Congress upon which
the Clerk claimed to base hisTicliuii, reso
lutions were offered und adopted admitting
the members from the above mentioned
States to their beats, when the House pro- j
ceded to vote for Speaker, and elected the
Hon. Schuyler Colfax, of Indiana, on the
first ballot.
Conrad McPherson, of Pennsylvania, was
elected clerk of ihe House ; N. G. Ordway,
of New Hampshire, sergcanl-ui-urms : ini
Goodenow, doorkeeper, and Win. S. King,

The Presidents Message wi.h its ac

the admiration of every ioyat citizen. 1
have heard the recessionists also, speak
of it in very fla.lering terms; and al
though it was asserted by Ropie that the
President would revoke his funner Proc
lamation of Freedom, yet he assures us in
Ins present Message, that while he holds
his position, ho will not retract or modi
fy his Emancipation I’rnclama‘ion ; or
return to slavery any person who has be
come free by the terms of that Proclama
tion, or by any act. of Congress. Thank
God ! this settles at once and forever, the
policy of the government in regard to
this important question. There will be
no retrograde movement.

As tbe period approaches for the assem
bling of oui Legislature the public voice it
being rapidly and unmistakably indicated
in favor of those best titled for the respon
sible positions to be tilled by it.
Second only to the practical legislation
involved in the vital issues passed upon so
decisively by the loyal people of the Slate
at the late election, is the choice of a Uni
ted States Senator and a Slate Treasurer.—
Tor the position first named, that portion of
the Press ot the State which supported the
cause of Goldsborough, Emancipation and
Unconditional Union, has already, with
great unanimity, pointed and is still ’ direct
ing attention to Judge Spence.
We now learn, with gratification, that for
the important ollice of State Treasurer the
choice of the Emancipationists, both in and
out ol the Legislature, is with equal posi
tiveness and concurrence in opinion direct
ed to William B. Hill, the present efficient
Secretary of Slate under Governor Brad
ford.
That Mr. Hill is pre-eminently qualified
and possesses claims of n superior charac
ter for the office, but few, if any, of those
who heartily co-operated with the Uncon
ditional Union men at the late election will
presume to question, iiis education, legal
acquirements, present identification with
and experience of the details of duty, uni
ted to his groat urbanity, dnoualified loyalty,
and thorough knowledge and apprepeialion
of the Stale’s true policy, men and meas
ures, presents such a cause of Jinuas —the
right man in the right place—as leads us to
anticipate hut little, if any, opposition to
his election when the Legislature shall have
convened in joint session. It will be by
ihe accomplishment of just such results —
the election ot such men as Spence and
j Hill—that the new era of Emancipation
j Irom the great evil ” may be most certainly
and most auspiciously inaugurated.

On Sunday night last thirteen shells were
fired into the city, and on the following dav
twenty-two more from Clillmore’a batteries,
doing considerable damage. The bombard
ment of Sumter and the other furls still
continue. A correspondent of the Boston
Traveller on board one of the iron clads at
Charleston writes that the Monitors, after a
siege of five months, are now in a belter
and more efficient condition, in consequence
of improvements, than at the commence of
active operations. The General testimony,
however, is in favor of the efficiency of the
frigate Ironsides, and the opinion is ex
pressed that if several vessels ot this class
were at the disposal of the Government less
difficulty would be experienced in obtaining
possession ot the city.
An arrival at New Vork from New Or
leans brings intelligence of the successful
operations of our forces in Western Louisi
ana. On the 2*th u 11., near Vermillion
ville, two regiments of Rebel cavalry were
defeated and a number of prisoners, arms,
Ac., captured. Two days previously,
another Rebel force were surprised near
New Iberia, where prisoners, horses and
arms were also captured. Guerrillas con
tinue active on the Mississippi. There is
nothing new from Texas by this arrival.
We have intelligence that the Union men
arc making energetic efforts fur the return
ol Arkansas to its allegiance. Conven
tions are being held, loyal men arc organiz
ing lor home deiensc, and a member of the

The Secretary of the Treasury ha* not
ret given notice of any intention to with
draw this popular Loan from Sale at Par, and
until ten days' notice is given, the undersigned,
as “ GENERAL SUBSCRIPTION AGENT.”
will continue to supply the public.
The whole amount ol the Loan authorized is
Five lluudied Million* of Dollars. Nearly
; Font Hundred Millions have deln al
j READY SUBSCRIBED FUR AND PAID INTO THE
i I rlaslrv, mostly within the last seven months.
The large demand from abroad, and the rapidly
increasing home demand for UMi as the basis for
circulation by National Banking Associations
now organizing in all parts of the country, will,
in a very short period, absorb the balance.—
Stiles have lately ranged from ten to lifteeu
millions weekly, frequently exceeding three
millions daily, and as it is well known that the
Sccietury oi the Treasury Ims ample uud un
failing resources in the Duties ou Imports and
Internal Revenues, and in tlie issue of the inter
est bearing Legal Tender Treasury Notes it is
almost u certainty that he will not lind it neces
sary, lor a long time to come, to seek a market
tor any other long or permanent Loans, THE
INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL OF WHICH ARE
PAYABLE IN GOLD.
Prudence and self interest must force the
minds of those contemplating the formation of
National Bunking Associations, as well us the
minds ot tho-.e who have idle money on their i
bands, to the prompt conclusion that they
should lose no time in subscribing to this must
popular Loan. It will soon be beyond their
teach, and advance to a handsome premium, us
was the result with the “ Seven Thirty ” Loan,
when it was all sold and Could no lon ,r er be
subscribed for at pur..
It is a Mix per Cent. l oan, the Interest, and i
Principal payable In Coin, thus yielding over
Niue pr.r Com. per annum at the present rule
oi premium ou coin.
Hie Government requires all duties ou im
ports to be paid in Coin; these duties have for
u long time past amounted to over a Quarter of
a Million ot Dollars daily, a sain nearly three
times gicater than that required in the payment
at the interest on all the o-dU’s and other per
manent Loans. So that it is hoped that the
surplus Coin In the Treasury, at no distat t dnv,
will enable the United States to resume s .ecie
payments upou ail Jiabiillijs.
The Loan is culled d-JU hum the fact that
whilst •ho Bonds may run for 20 years yet the
Uo\ eminent has a light to pay them off‘in Gold
at pur, u any time after a years.
The Interest is paid ha f-yearly, viz; on the
first days of November an 1 May.
Subscribers can have Coupon Bonds, which
aie payable to bearer, and are JfltOO, SIOO, s.>oo,
and $looo; or Registered Bonds of same de
nominations, and iu addition, sr.ooo and $lO
- lor Banking purposes and for invest
ments of Trust-uionics the Registered Bonds
are preferable.
1 iifc.se ;-*JO s cannot be taxed by Slates, cities,
towns or counties, and the Government taxon
them is only one-and-a-half per cent., on the
amount of income, when tho income of the
holder exceeds Six Hundred dollars per annum ;
till other investments, such* us income tioiw
Mortgaged Railroad Stock and Bonds, etc.,
must pay hum three to live per cent, tax on the
income.
Banks and Rankers throughout the Country
will combine to dispose of the Bonds; and all
orders by mail, or otherwise, promptly attended
to.
The inconvenience of a few days’ delay in
tiie delivery of the Bonds is unavoidable, the
demand being so great; but as interest com
mences Irotn the day of subscription, no loss is
occasioned, and every effort Is being made to
diminish tho delay. JAY COOKE,
