Take Responsibility ot
the Position.
(From a Staff Correspondent.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.-(Speclal Tele
gram.) It appears Ohio capital has become
Interested In the construction of a railroad
and passenger bridge across the Missouri
river at Yankton, S. D., and now Senator
Foraker comes forward with a bill to ex
tend the time given under the original char
ter for another term of years. Congre.s
In April, 1904, authorised the Winnipeg,
Yankton ft Gulf railroad to construct a
combined railroad, wagon and foot bridge
across the Missouri river at Yankton, but
the company gaining the charter has not
yet made a move to carry out the work.
The concession Is a valunble one and the,
company apparently does not desire to
abandon it. New blood in the shape of
capital has been enlisted and the life of
the concession Is sought to be extended by
Senator Foraker, who, It Is said, repre
sents constituents who have Invested in
the project.

Paul Smith, living half a mile out, offered
to take the place If permitted to name the

PRISONER CONFESSES MURDER
Dnvld Cartls WKhonl Emotion Tells
Attorney tie Killed Dona
Gllman.
DAYTON, O., Dec. 7. "Yes, I did it, I
am the murderer of Dona Oilman."
Cooly and without the slightest sign of
emotion or remorse, David Curtis at 4
o'clock this morning made the above con
fession to the prosecuting attorney and
detectives.
The confession was made without the
sweating process and was complete in every
detail.
The statement of Curtis was as follows:
"On the evening of November 30 I ate
supper In the Cadillac restaurant, on Fifth
street. Just as I came out I saw Dona
Gllman waiting for her car and I also
boarded the westbound Fifth street car. At
National and Oroveland avenueB 1 alighted.
Shortly after the car had started up the
hill and as she took the west side of the
street I followed up the hill on the east
side. I then committed the assault."
After the confession Curtis wept bitterly,
but he declared he w;is glad to have made
the confession and relieved his mind.
Curtis earned a precarious living selling i
newspapers. He Is half-witted.
ilona Gllman, a LHi-year-old girl, was
criminally assaulted and strangled to death
on the evening ot November :o within 2tO
im ilia cvriiuiK vi itutnnuci v viiiim a.w ,
yards of her home on Arlington Height,
a suburb of this city, while returning home
from work. Her body was discovered by
follow- i
her 16-year-old brother. Collins, the
lng Thursday morning lying in a vacant lot j
nearly opposite the Gllman home. The i
spot where the body was supposed lo have '
lain during Wednesday was In plain view j
of passers-by and occupants of neighbor-
lng houses and the delayed discovery lent
mystery to the alTatr. The authorities for
a while were Inclined to believe that some
members of the family were Implicated in
the murder and that evidences of criminal
assault had betn framed up to cover their
tracks. After complete Investigation this
theory was ahandoned.
Many suspects were arrested In this and
other cities, but all succeeded In establish
ing their Innocence.

Friday afternoon when Judge Sutton in
ruling on an objection to the Introduction

of which Mr. Howell Is chairman, for vlo-
crnoon was spent with this evidence.
Charles K. Coutant on Stand.
Charles K. Coutant of Coutant & Squires
was tho first ' witness and his testimony
was devoted entirely to the attempt of the
defense to show the cost of coal to Omaha
dealer. Judge Sutton, however, ruled out

Randall K. Brown was the first witness No feature of the export trade In agrlcul
to testify for the defense on the subject tural products has shown a more steady,
of soliciting. A ripple of laughter floated I rapid growth than that of meat and dairy
over the room when Mr. Connell, directing I products, of which there was an Increase
the window shades to be raised, asked Mr.
Brown to read the big coal signs on the
buildings In sight of tho court room. County
Attorney Slabnugh objected, declaring there
would be no way to get the buildings be
fore the supreme court if the case should
be carried up there, and that It was not
material to the case. A heated argument
of the definition of the word "soliciting''
followed, Mr. Connell contending any kind
of advertising directing attention to the
wares of the advertiser was soliciting. The
court ruled against him and excluded all
evidence about the signs. It was during
this controversy Judge Sutton made his
ruling regarding the section of the consti
tution relating to soliciting.
Circular Ada Thrown Out.
Judge Sutton admitted as evidence cir
cular advertisement which had been dis
tributed about the city, but after the re
cess which followed Mr. Brown's testimony
withdrew them and excluded his evidence
regarding them.
The must direct evidence regarding so
liciting was given by J. A. Sunderland. '
"Tell the Jury what you have done in the
way cf making personal applications to
consumers to buy coal of you?" said Mr.
Connell.
"We have several men who solicit and
certain ones whose exclusive business it is
to solicit from retailers and consumers."
He said it was their duty to go out on
the street and to business places and try to
sell coal.
"How about other dealers?"
"I think it is quite customary."
He said he had solicited himself and
named his neighbor, C. W. Vurgan, as one
he had asked to buy coal from him. He
also named a number of coal Anns who
employ solicitors. In his own firm he sa d
It was the business of retail clerks and
yard superintendents to solicit, and in ad
dition they had two solicitors employed.
County Attorney Slabaugh objected to
these question on the ground it did not ex
cuse the dealers if they violated the agree
ment they had made. The court admitted
the evidence as bearing on the question,
whether or not the section of the constitu
tion relating to soliciting was In force.
At fi o'clock it appeared that a number
of new witnesses would have to be called,
so court adjourned until 9:30 this morning,
no night session being held.
One of the Jurors who has been accus
tomed to taking his morning's morning reg
ularly is so affected by his forced ride upon
the water wagon he had to appeal to the
court last night for relief. Judge Sutton
directed him to see a physician and if he
prescribed a stimulant it might be taken
under the physician's direction. The Juror
could hurdly wait for his companions in
his eagerness to consult the doctor.
Coaaell aad tha Paper.
Th pauha of Mr. Connell's wrath
against
the evening paper was the
publication of an alleged statement
by Jains I. Kemp, said to have been
made after Kemp left th witness stand
that he wa afraid to tell the whole truth

Courts of Ohio.
FINDLAY, O., Dec. 7. Attorneys of the

gued the motion to dismiss the petition in

Only the llralnnlng.
After the Indictments had been returned
! and bench warrants had been Issued, th
: grand Jury adjourned until the first
Monday In Januury. Assistant Attorney
' General Maynard stated that when the
grand Jury reconvened after the holiday
the Inquisition will be resumed. The ln
I dictments returned today, he said, mark
' only the beginning of the government's
probing operations In Utah and Wyoming,
and the violations of laws alleged in these
Indictments are only incidents of a gigan
tic fift-stem of fraud that has been In opera
tion lr the west for many years.
The Indictment against the Utah Fuel
company and the six ugents of that com
pany Is based on the methods used In ac
quiring about 1.400 acres of coal lands In
Sevier county, Utah. The lands wer filed
on In March, 1005.
Methods of Securing; Titles.
Robert Forrester, geologist and mining
expert of the Utah Fuel company. Is al
leged to have been charged with the actual
direction of the men who filed on the lands.
i Atler Forrester had prospected the ground,
! George A. Moore, the Utah Fuel company's
aBent In Denver, went over the numerous
claims and on each one caused to be dug
I an excavation exposing the coal deposits.
Dummy" locators were then secured to
make filings on the claims. These wer
mostly young men, who were each paid
$5, their expenses to and from the lands
! Bnd 3 Per dlem n!le were employed
In entering the claims. There was an ex
plicit understanding In advance that the
claims were to be conveyed to the Utah
Fuel company or its agents.
These dummies were taken upon the
lands, the uncovered coal deposits were
shown to them, and Immediately they filed
on the lands with application papers made
out by the company's attorney. Major Wil
liam H. Bird. Major Bird has since died.
All the entries to the 1,400 acres Involved
were made on ths same date, March 21,
1906.
! For each of the claims thus secured it
was neceeoary that a payment of fl.doO
; should be made to the government. Loans
. for this amount were made by various
, persons. The government prosecutors
' charge that the persons from whom tho
, loans were secured were mere agents of
the coal company.
i On April 4, li6, the coal lands were
I transferred to Frank A. Calkins. Mr.
Calkins Is father-ln-iaw of E. N. Clark.
the Denver attorney against whom an In
dictment was returned today.
Lands Advertised for Sale.
Before these transfers were made Mr.
Calkins, accompanied by Attorney Clark,
wen over the lands, making a pretense
of lrspecting them. In the November fol
lowing Calkins, in newspapers of Salt Luke
City, advertised his coal lands for aie.
From Calkins the lands were transferred
to Frank B. Cook, a mining man of Sail
Lake City. The lauds now stand In Cook
name. The allegation of the government's
attorney. Is that Cook holds the land, lu
trust for the I tah Fuel company.
