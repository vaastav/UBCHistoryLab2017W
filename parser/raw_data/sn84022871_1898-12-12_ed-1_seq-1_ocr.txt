The Johnson Line steamer, Veda
more, of Liverpool, Capt. Bartlett,
for whose safety fears were beginning
to be f elt,as"she was several days over
due, arrived at its destination last
week with 45 shipwrecked sailors
from the steamer Londonian, whom
she had picked up at sea. Twenty-five
others went down with their ship,
i
The Brockton, Mass. papers of last
week contained long accounts of the
vote on the license question in that
city. Last year the city went for li
cense by thirteen votes, and after
living under the law for the past year
the voters this year cast their votes
as follows: For license, 2592, for pro
hibition, 4724, majority in favor of
prohibition, 2133. This short exper
ience with the saloons seems to be
enough for Brockton, as the vote was
very large and showed the feeling of
of the people.
A despatch received from Paris is
as follows: "The United States and
Spanish Peace Commissioners con
cluded their work to-day, and finally
settled the terms of the treaty of peace.
They willlmeet once more in, formal
session, on Saturday or Monday next
when the Spanish Commissioners,
sorrowfully, and the Americans with
feelings of relief, will write 'their
signatures upon the document which
embodies the results of the war, and
the preparation of which has consum
ed eleven weeks, a longer time than
the war itself. In the meantime, the
treaty will be engrossed under the
supervision of Mr. Moore and Senor
Ojeda, the secretaries of the respect
ive commissions."
Secretary Alger's annual report is a
verv interesting document, embrac
ing, as it does, a brief, but compre
hensive sketch of the conduct of the
war, with copies of all official orders
relating to the army, etc. A careful
study of it will remove the last ves
tige of foundation for most of the
stories attacking the management of
the "War Department. For instance,
the official figures of the wounded in
the Santiago campaign are a complete
refutation of the stories that the
wounded were not properly cared for.
There were 140 surgeons with General
Shafter's army. The total number of
wounded was 1,431, of whom only 13 1
died of their wounds, a percentage as
remarkable in the history of the war
as some of the more talked about
achievements of the war.
President McKinley's annual mes
sage to Congress is a thoroughly pat
riotic from start to finish. There is
not a word of partisanship in it. The
message will not only be read with in
terest, but will be carefully preserved,
as it is an authentic, condensed his
tory of the events leading to the war
with Spain, of the war, and of the re
sults of the war, so far as they are
known at this time. It is, in itself
alone, sufficient to place . President
McKinley in the very front rank of
American statesmen, if he had noi
already attained that position. It is
necessarily long, but contains no
platitudes, no striving after effect
nor bids for popular favor. It is a
plain statement of the most impor
tant events in the country's history,
by a man whose patrioitism has been
proven by trials such as few men have
gone through. It ought to be read in
every school-house in the land and
studied as a lesson in current Amer
ican history. Even the most partisan
democrats find nothing in it to ob
ject to, which is something very un
usual in Presidents' messages.
The attendance at the opening of
Congress was quite up to the average,
both on the floor of the House and Sen
ate and in the galleries. Speaker Beed
opened the House, his smiling face in
dicating a contentment that must
have been envied by those democrats
who have been engaged in overthrow
ing him, on paper. Vice President
Hobart presided over the Senate
in his usual dignified manner. Among
the notable Senatorial absentees were
Senators Davis of Minn.; Frye of Me.
and Gray of Delaware, who detained
in Paris by their work as American
Peace commissioners, but who expect
to complete the treaty of peace and
start for home in a very few days, the
difficult part having been accomplish
ed when the Spanish Commissioners
agreed to our terms, a week ago.
THE TREASUR Y REPORT.
The annual report of the Secretary
of the Treasury is this year of far
more than the usual interest, for it
sets forth the results of the war in
increased taxation, revenue and ex
penditures. Of course, the report does not cov
er the entire war, for the fiscal year
1898 ended on June 30. But the last
four months of the year were months
of active military preparation and
the last two were months of actual
hostilities. This is reflected in the
sudden mounting up of our army ex
penditures to nearly $92,000,000, and
of our navy expenditures to nearly
59,000,000. But all this increase was
given in a good cause and it has pro
duced glorious results. The people
do not begrudge the cost, though one
immediate effect is a deficit in our
national finances. The total expend
itures for 1898 were $532,381,201.35;
the receipts were $494,333, 953. 75,
leaving an adverse balance for the
year of $38,047,247.60. Secretary Gage
estimates that there will be a deficit
of $112,000,000 in the present fiscal
year, and of $30,000,000 in the hscal
year 1900. This ought to make it ob
vious to everybody that it will be a
considerable time before the war tax
ation can safely be dispensed withj
In foreign commerce, as the Jour
nal has already shown from time to
time, the year 1898 has been the record-breaking
year in American his
tory. The total exports of the products
of American industry were the heav
iest ever recorded. For the first time
in our history our exports averaged
more than $100,000,000 a month. For
the first time, also, our exports of
manufactured goods exceeds our im
ports of foreign manufactures. More
over, our total exports were double
our total imports and the balance of
trade in our favor was by far the larg
est ever known.
The most important recommenda -
tions of Secretary Gage's report are
those relative to the strengthening of
our merchant marine. Secetary Gage
believes that the time has come when
some positive action is imperative.
He favors, first, the remodeling of the
Postal Subsidy act of March 3, 1891, to
bring it up to latest requirements;
second, the establishment of a system
of graded bounties upon a mileage
basis for the encouragement of Amer
ican vessels in the foreign trade, and
special provision for the deep sea fish
eries this legislation to have direct
reference to the national defence;
third, an extended application of the
act of May 10, 1892, by which the In
man liners City of Paris and City of
New York were abmitted to American
registry and two sister ships, the St.
Louis and St. Paul, were built in
American shipyards but Mr. Gage
would not have this affect the coast
wise trade; fourth, an increase in our
tonnage taxes to the European level;
fifth, tha restrictions of trade be
tween the United States, Porto Rico
and Hawaii and the coasting trade of
the islands to ships of American reg
istry. Boston Journal.
