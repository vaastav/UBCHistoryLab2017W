faFBiess of the faet that he can give
fso idea Of, what It is going to cost or
hdw certain of the. problems now
faretf are going to be met.
To the houses of congress he leaves
at the present tint thfe responsibility
flf devising the methods td be used In
tirinffing about the readjustment af
ter having as he declared set the stage
for them by enumerating some of the
things to be done Without giving his
advice as to how it Ehoiiid be done.
J'rt tnii particular he Bep"arts from the

taken regarding themi but he makes

that he ws cofhmltted to govern

Klseft for the reeeht cbhtrol of the

The president's message to.coriSrsss

contains little in the Way of ' definite

that it is the duty of congress to de

Sitting on the edge of the bed) his
