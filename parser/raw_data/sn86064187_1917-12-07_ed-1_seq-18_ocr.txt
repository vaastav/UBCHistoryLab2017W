But if you were a clerk facing frantic and frenzied

"FOUR BITES OF A CHERRY."
By THIODORK ROOSEVELT.
TN HIS recent message to congress President Wilson
stated that in order "to push our great war f fi"l mi
and justice to its rightrous turn lusion vsc mint rlrar avsav
with a thorough hand all imrdnnrnn to success" and
added, "the very embarrassing obstacle thai stands in our
way is that we are at war with (icrnuuy.'ul not with her
allies."
He recommended that we declare war on Austria, and
added, "the same logic would lead also to a declaration of
war against Turkey and Bulgaria " Hut infemitially and
for reasons not apparent lie advised against such action.
The president is entirely right in slating that our failure
hitherto to declare war on the allies of (iermatiy has been
a very embarrassing obstacle to our success, and he is
entirely right in advising a declaration of war against
Austria. Incidentally, I wish to point out that this is
precisely what I insisted upon in these columns two months
ago, and what I had elsewhere advocated six months ago,
and it w worth while remembering that the administration
papers then assailed me for urging the rourse which,
although there has not been the slightest change in the
situation, the president now urges.
There was no justification whatever for failure to
declare war on Austria when we declared war on Germany
and there is now no justification for failure to declare war
on Bulgaria and Turkey when we declare; war on Austria.
There is no use in making four bites of a chetry. There is
no use in going to war a little, hut not much. The presi
dent has sent a message pledging support to Rumania, hut
it is worse than an empty form to send surh a message
unless we forthwith declare war on Bulgaria. The president
has appointed a Sunday for the special expression of
sympathy with Armenia, but such expression of sympathy
is utterly meaningless unless we go to war with Turkey.
The Austro-Hungarian and Turkish empires must he broken
up if we intend to make the world even moderately safe
for democraoy. There must he a revived Poland, taking in
all the Poles of Austria, Prussia and Russia; a greater
Bohemia, taking in Moravia and the Slovaks ; a great Jugo
slav commonwealth including Serbia', CroaTTa, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, while the Rumanians in Hungary should be
come part of Rumania and the Italians in Austria part of
Italy.
The Turk must he driven from Kurope and Christian and
Arab freed. Only in this manner can we do justice to the
subject peoples tyranniied over by the Germans, Magyars
and Turks. Only in this way can we remove the menace of
German aggression, which has become a haunting nightmare
for all civilirations, especially in the case of small, well
behaved, liberty-loving peoples.
By declaring war on Oerrnany's allies we do not commit
ourselves to asking anything that is n just for , our own
allies. But by failing tn declare war on Germany's allies
we are ourselves guilty of injustice to our own allies.

GENERAL HOFFMAN.
A PPOINTMENT to command a division in Prance is in
itself a fine compliment to the military ability of
Brigadier General Roy Hoffman, of this city, and a cause
of gratification tohis many friends. General Pershing,
no doubt, is selecting his commanders for overseas di
visions, and that thorough fighting man can be relied upon
to select them for filfiess, and no other reason. There is
a big task to do out there, and the army needs demand
that men in high places, as well as troopers in the ranks,
be qualified to do it. Those who have known General Hoff
man's close study of military matters, and his real for the
cause he serves, will not question his fitness for the under
taking.. It is also quite likely that he will he advanced in
rank, as well as given a lafgrr and more important com
mand, and that he will soon be Major General Hoffman.
It has been the rule to place divisions in command of
major generals, and probably no exception will be made
in this instance. Such promotion will be a fitting reward
to an officer and a gentleman, who will give his country
the best he has, which is good.

Ibis shows a part of the high cost of a kaiser. Whenever at emperor is a
vigorous man he is likelv to become sooner or later euilty of a serious outbreak.
The temptation to nse his machinery for purposes destructive to the neighbors,
and possibly profitable to him, is ever present. The absolute monarchy is better
fitted fur war than for anything else, arid better fitted for war than any other
form of government, because it is in a position to subordinate to war all human
activities within its jurisdiction. Al long as an empire which has no means ol
cheeking itj ruler hat upon the throne a monarch who is weak in mind and
body the neighbors arc not in any especial danger from that quarter, but when
ever an emjicror who is virile and ambitious mounts to the throne he, finds
ready to liaml the means of making a great wax machine. Wilhelm was such
a man and in such drcumttanccs he earned long ago the title of "War Lord."
not because he had made war, but because he. was more interested in making
preparations for war than in any other matter, and because it was believed
generally, and prophesied freely, that the time would come when, in a literal
sense, the German kaiser would set the world on firev
When Archduke I ran Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated the snark
which was to start the conflagration was dropped, not by the assassin, hut by
dermany through diplomatic channels, when Austria-Hungary was egged on
to make a
and unwarr
a state upon
Ylot had caused the murder. In other words, the spark was imt dropped by the
reckless hands of an assassin. A short time fuse was righted by the pressing
of a button in Potsdam palace.
The war lords ambition to set the world on fire, in the hope of getting
loot from the ruins was at last realized, after years or more or less patient
waiting. "The Day," talked of almost publirlv in Germany, and unite nnbliely
outside of Germany by persons who knew Germany; the day for setting the
i russian tot upon the neck ot Prance, and maybe l-.ngland; the day to which
Wilhelm had looked forward as a young girl looks forward to her wedding
day, had come. The stored ammunition, the massed guns, the trained millions
began the long-planned inundation of France. Kverything was cocked and
primed for a swift drive, a quick decision, a Rlorious victory, a second Sedan,
a greater German empire, a Wilhelm the Great in a country which had hail
its Frederick the Great. These plans miscarried. They never will be realized,
but at what cost, as shown by what already has been spent, of blood and treasure,
and what has been marred or destroyed utterly; at what cost has the civiliza
tion of the twentieth century suffered the existence and witnessed the glory of
a kaiser.
Wsyrld history contains plenty of precedents to prove that such events as
this war, on a scale commensurate with the opportunities of one ruler to kick
up a general row, always follow the crowning vl an ambitious man who is not
a titular ruler, but an actual ruler. Germany has a constitution, ancj certain
hollow forms of law designed bv royalty to make the appearance of constitu
tional limitation of royal authority, but the kaiser's power to make war is
about the same as that ot a khan ol lartary in the tune of Tamerlane.
Behold the reyilts, so far as the world has gone in paying for its upkeep of
a kaiser. Ihe Manchester Guardian's figures may have tn he doubled before
