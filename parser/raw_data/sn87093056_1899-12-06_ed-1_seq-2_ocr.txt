A JOYOUS THANKSGIVING.
Another Thanksgiving day has
come and gone and it is doubtful if
the American people ever passed a
more joyous one. The following ex
tract from an address by Rev. F. V.
Stevens at Spokane last Thursday is
well worth reproducing:
"This ought to be the greatest
Thanksgiving day of the century.
God has seemingly said to us: 'Peace
within thy walls and prosperity with
in thy palaces.' The year has brought
healing to our financial diseases; our
nation wa9 never before so rich and
prosperous. In wealth we stand at
the head of the nations. In expecta
tion and hope we distance them all.
"The field and orchard and mine
have yielded more than their accus
tomed increase. The year has brought
no disaster to any large section of the
country. The cry of the hungry does
not reach our ear from within our
borders. Shops and factories are run
ning night and day, and few are stand
ing idle in the market places. The
ends of the earth are calling for our
wares, and the means of transporta
tion are taxed to their utmost to car
ry them to their destination.
"In the history of the world's indus
tries there never lias been such a spec
tacle as the industrial expansion of
America during the past two years.
The cry cf discontented has been si
lent in the abundance of labor and its.
ample remuneration. The hovel is
giving placo to the cottage and the
cottage to the commodious home.
American skill and genius and thrift
have come to the day of their first
large fruitage aud to a place of merit
ed honor among the nations of the
world.
"The former contempt of the older
nations has suddenly been changed to
helpless envy or wholesome respect.
Feared and honored abroad, influential
in the great world movements that
makes for good, harmonious and unit
ed at home, the American people were
never so secure in their inheritance as
they are today. Our national expan
sion is far more than the acquisition
of a few islands with their half-sav.ige
peoples. It is rather the sudden ex
pansion of our marvelous industries
and the attainment of supremacy in
trade, and through this the attain
ment of a place of powerful influence
in the councils of the nations."
President McKinley's message to
Congress has been given to the coun
try and is issued under date of Dec. 5,
1899. It maintains the gold standard,
recommends the crushing out of
Aguinaldo's rebellion, giving Cuba ab
solute liberty, encouraging and devel
oping trade with China, assisting
Puerto Rico and aiding the merchant
marine. It is one of the ablest docu
ments of its kind ever written.
Home merchants are the men who
give you credit when you have no cash
to pay. The home merchants are the
men who help you pay the taxes that
run your schools and pave your streets.
The home merchants are the men to
whom you appeal for favors. Then
why order goods from traveling agents
who represent nothing in common
with your interests?
Ere long you may expect to read
something like the following in the
daily papers: About 10 o'clock this
morning a horseless milk wagon load
ed with cowless milk collided with a
brainless rider on a chninless wheel.
The luckless wheelman was badly in
jured, and being homeless, was taken
to the home for the friendless.
A monster petition con taining seven
million names protesting against the
seating of Brighain H. Roberts, the
polygamous congressman from Utah,
was presented to congress yesterday.
It has been truly said that peaceful
expansion is in perfect harmony with
all American traditions and the con
stitution.
With bleak December conies tlie
most pleasant holiday season of the
year. The windows of the retail
stores already indicate the preparation
for Christmas. The merchants have
their stores well stocked with gifts for
this occasion and have every reason
to expect a splendid trade. The year
has been a most. prosperous one for
Washington citizens and they are pre
pared to be generous at Christmas
tide. Perhaps the chief joy of the
holiday is in planning and preparing
for it. Friends are already beginning
to feel the milder glow of the pleasure
of giving. Shopping expeditions are
the delight of the ladies at all seasons
of the year. They culminate in De
cember and the merchants now have
their goods displayed so as to furnish
suggestions for the givers. Certainly
there is no custom which bettor draws
out the character of the people than
this thoughtfulness for others, which
is exhibited at Christinas. Those who
really enjoy the exchange of remem
brances look forward to selecting
some gift, be it costly or not, which
will please. These are now delight
ins in the search for the choice gifts,
the presents which will be most
thankfully received because of the
care with which they ate selected.
Now is indeed the time to choose.
A couple of weeks later the stores will
be open day and night lyid crowded so
that what would be a pleasure be
comes a bore. Those who get the full
enjoyment.out ol the holiday have al
ready bjgun to taste its pleasure in
selecting their favors for friends.
The News wishes to sound a warn
ing note against all kinds of traveling
fakes or venders who purport to sell
something cheaper than the home
dealer can. The country is full of
men going from place to place telling
the unsuspecting farmer how he can
save money by purchasing his wares,
thereby saving the "middle man's"
profit. He goes on to run down the
home dealer and says the merchants
are "skinning" you and that they are
getting rich off you, etc. Now let's
tee if this fellow's story is a likely one.
In the first place, the man that travels
and sells something is not doing it for
the great big love he has for the peo
ple, neither is he out for his health,
therefore we can come to but one con
clusion: He is making money. If
he wasn't, ho wouldn't bo out. He
has to pay traveling exponscs, such as
car fare, hotel bills, horse and buggy
hire, and many other bills the lesideut
dealer doesn't have to meet. Again
the traveler gets his goods from the
cast and pays freight on a small lot
where the merchant buys his goods in
carload lots, thereby getting goods
laid down at home for much less than
the man that happens to "blow
through." The home dealer, of course,
makes a profit on his goods, but is he
as liable to 10b you of yo(\r hard-earn
ed cash as the traveler who has no
interest in the welfare of the country?
li every man will buy at home and let
these traveling farmers' friends (?)
alone he will come out better in the
long run and not be half so apt to get
"skinned." Try it a while and see if
we are not right.
Forgetfulness.
Reader have you ever thought how.
difficult it is to find an unbroken
family, says an exchange? Most of us
are fragments of families, scattered here
and there, struggling as best we may.
We think of fathsr, mother and child
ren scattered like the mists of the
morning. There is something in life
which makes us forgetful of each
other's welfare when we become sep
arated. How often do you write to
brother and sister? We dare say if
you will sit down and count the days
you will be surprised to find that it
has been months and perhaps years
since you wrote to either of them.
Once in a great while a letter passes
telling of the dear love and askiug to
be forgiven for not writing oftener,
then a long silence. A telegram is
handed you after a while and your
fingers tremble while you tear the
envelope. You read that father,
mother, sister or brother died on such
a day. You go away )>y yourself, shed
a profusion of tears, and regret a
thousand times the negligence to the
dear departed. The duties of life are
so absent from our time and thoughts
that we forget, when wo should re
member.
TROUBLES OF OUR OWN.
Within the last month several com
munications have reached us for pub
lication but as they dealt unkindly
and unfairly with the private life and
business of private citizens their pub
lication was refused. Under its pre
sent management the > T sws can not.
be used as a cudgel to beat out any
one's private spite or to take a hand
in their quarrels. Communications
dealing with public men in their offi
cial capacity, questions of education
or health, or matters of general good
to the community will be published
over the name of the writer, and such
articles arc invited. The time, how
ever, has passed wheu anyone having
a personal grudge, either real or imag-1
inary, can rush into print over a non
de-plume and endeavor to injure the
object of his spite through the columns
of the press.
SAT DOWN ON LAWLESSNESS.
lirav? and honest words were those
which Chief Justice Huston of the
supreme court of Idaho, delivered at
Boise last Monday wherein he denied
the writ of habeas" corpus in the I'aul
Corcoran case. They were words
which breath hope and encourage
ment to every loyal citizen in the
state of Idaho and carry despair in
the hearts of those who foster crime
and shelter criminals. They say as
plainly as words can say that the foul
spirit of anarchy and intolerance
which has dared to raise its vicious
head in northern Idaho will find no
sanction in the supreme court of that
state. They bear in every line the
impress of truth, of honesty, and of
unswerving allegiance to the free and
liberal institutions of government
which every true American cherishes.
They are words which will brace up
the weak-kneed and restore confidence
to those who doubted the ability of
the state executive and the suprem
acy of the courts in dealing with the
criminal conditions which have
brought reproach upon Shoshone
county, in every state in the union.
It seems to be one of the methods
of the Miners' Union and similar or
ganizations whenever an attempt is
made to bring them to account for
their unlawful, barbarous and murder
ous acts, to at onoe commence an
attack upon the legally constituted
authorities who are endeavoring to
enforce and maintain the law, and by
their false clamor to seek to execite
sympathy for the malefactors; and
suoh action, by virtue of the recogniz
ed freedom of the press in this country
always finds an echo and too frequent
ly, endorsement with that portion of
the press whose moral principles are
governed and controlled by what is
for their gain. Thousands of miles
from the scene of transactions, they
assume to judge and criticise. These
leading journals of civilization hesi
tate not, upon no other authority
than the luried reports of known
malefactors, and their advocates and
defenders, to assail indiscriminately
the legally constituted authorities of
a community and state for their ef
forts to maintain the law and protect
persons and property within their
jurisdiction. In keeping with their
custom and rule, both the executive
and judiciary of the state have been
assailed in terms of unmeasured vitup
eration for simply doing their duty
under their oath of office.
A printing office in a little town in
Michigan is always opened with prayer.
This is a rare exception to the rule, aa
from time immemorial it has
been customary for the office to be
opened, by the devil and closed by th»
sheriff.
The executive committee of the
National Repulican League will meet
