BALFOUR AND CABINET RESIGN
King Edward Accepts Same and In
structs Campbell-Bannerman
for Form New Cabinet.
London, Deo S.—The politioal crisis
in the United Kingdom has reached a
climax Arthur J. Balfour, the pre
mier, has formerly tendered the resig
nations of himself and the members of
his oabinet to King Edward, who ac
cepted them. His majesty has invited
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman to an
interview, when he will offei him the
mission of forming a new cabinet. Sir
Henry will accept the task, and within
a few days a new government will be
formed
It may be stated as certain that Eord
Kosebery will be entirely ingored in
the makeup of the oabinet and that
John Morley will be one of the chief
advisers of Sir Henry in drawing np
the list of hie official family, whioh
will be presented to his majesty.
Mr. Morley himself is considered like
ly to go to the Indian oftioe, and it ia
probable that Herbert Henry Asquith
will be chancellor of the exchequer.
The foreign affairs portfolio will go
either to Lord Elgin or Sir Edward
Orey, though the latter is considered
likely to be made secretary of the oolo
nies.
One thing is certain—that Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman has explained
his attitude on home rule for Ireland
to those liberal leaders who are known
to be Opposed to home rnle on the lines
of the last bills introduoed in parlia
ment. Since his speech at Stirling,
wbioh raised snch a fniore, Sir Henry
has not made any statement, bnt it is
confidently asserted in the liberal olnbs
that he is ready with a polioy which
will seoure the adhesion of the British
nationalists, and at the same time
avoid raising the issue of one of the
prominent planks in his platform.
There is some nnoertainty as to when
the dissnlntion of parliament will be
effective, bnt it is not considered prob
able nntil after the new year.
An interesting feature of the politi
oal sitnation is the prospect of a closer
allianoe between the Irish and the
labor parties in the new parliament.
James Keir Hardie, the scciaiist and
independent member, in a politioal
speech tonight frankly invited suoh an
alliance. He pointed ont that 45 labor
members combined with 75 Irish mem
bers wonld provide a voting strength
whioh no government, however strong,
oonld afford to ignore.
RECORD OF LIFE BAVERS.
Thousand* of Person* Rescued and
Many Crafts Baved.
Tho work of the life saving service
for the last fiscal year is summed up
in a report of General Superintendent
Kimball to the secretary of the treas
ury, recently made public. The life
saving crews saved and assisted in
saving 464 imperiled vessels and their
cargoes, besides affording assistance
of moie or less importance to 677 oth
er vessels, including craft of all kinds,
making a total of 1141 vessels to which
aid was furnished. In addition, the
report states, 83 steamers and 88 sail
ing vessels running Into danger were
warned of their peril by the signals of
the patrols and lookout In time to
escape disaster. The saving of many
lives and much pruperty Is attributed
to such warnings.
No less than 365 disasters to docu
mented vessels occurred during the
period slated, involving the lives of
4109 persons, of whom 27 were lost.
The estimated value of vessels and
cargoos so affected was $10,320,660; of
which $7,917,385 was saved. Sixty
three vessels were totally lost. Succor
was afforded at the various fttatlonk to
624 persons, to whom an aggregate of
1510 days' relief was furnished. ,Four
hundred ami twenty casualties were
sustained by undocumented vessels,
such as sail boats and row boats, in
volving 955 persons, 10 of whom were
lost. The value of property involved
In these casualties is estimated at
$264,690, of which $258,025 was saved.
The report concludes with an earn
est appeal for pensions to widows apd
children of members of the life sav
ing crews losing their lives in the
performance of duty and for retire
ment when disabled from injury or dis
ease incurred in the service.
THREW AT ROOSEVELT TRAIN.

IN DARK AS TO MQBCOW.
Last News From There Is of Pillage
' and; Arson.'- .
Berlin, Dec. s.—Absence of news
from' Moscow leads to.tbe worst con
clusions In respect to that city's fate.
The latent -'information was that the
old capital was In the hands of mobs
that sacked and burned all the gov
ernment buildings, and the police and
Cossacks pillaged the imperial gran
eries and cut the telegraph wires. It
is evident the last line of communica
tion was severed at least 24 hours ago
and that Moscow is Isolated, not only
from the world, but from the remain
der of Russia.

EIGHTEENMETDEATH
EXPLOSION IN COAL MINE NEAR
DIAMQNDVILLE, WYO.
Rescuers Are Driven Back—Shock It
Felt All Over Town, Violently Rock
ing Buildings—Victims Are Instantly
Killed—Pathetic Bcenes at the Shaft
—Explosion 1100 Feet Underground.
Dlaniondvllle, Wyo., Dec. 4.—Eight
een miners lost their lives by an ex
plosion In the Diamond Coal & Cuke
company's mine No. 1. It is believed
that all (be men who perished were
Instantly killed. What caused the dis
aster Is not definitely known, but the
theory advanced by the miners 1b that
a "blown out" shot caused dust explo
sion, which wrecked the mine. The
explosion was felt all over the town,
rocking buildings so violently that the
occupauts ran out Into the open. The
news that there had been another dis
aster at the Diamond mine —the sec
ond in less tuan five years—spread
through the village, and practically
the whole population of Dlamondvllle
flocked to the mine shaft. In the pre
vious explosion, which occurred Feb
ruary 26, 1901, 32 miners perished.
Wives and children of the eatombed
miners were among those who rushed
to the shaft, and the sceaes there were
most patuetlc. The men were ready
to enter the shaft. It was impossible
to do so, owing to the after efTects
of the explosion, and Superintendent
Sneddon Insisted tbat all precautions
against fire should be taken.
The explosion occurred 1100 feet
underground and at least 3000 feet
from the mouth of the shaft.
The 800 coal diggers of the Diamond
mines were assisted in rescue work
by many miners who came over from
Kemmerer, a .ew miles distant.
Evsry man In the mine perished.
The night force was small, their work
being limited to knocking down coal
to be taken jout by the day shift. Had
the explosion occurred In daytime, the
loss of life would have been far
greater.
The Diamond Coal & Coke company
Is a Salt l,ake v»iy concern. The out
put of the mine Is largely Bhipped to
Salt l,ake City and the smelters at
Anaconda, Mont.
Many English miners, who came di
rect to the mines from England, are
employed In Dlamondvllle, and It Is
believed tnat a majority of the dead
are Englishmen.
