K is pockfcvely said at tlie Executive Mansion
tuert is no truth whatever iu the rumors ol Secre
tary boutwell's resignation. an<l it is also asserted
that IiIh relations witn the President are, as hereto
fore, of a fcfcmdly character, both in their personal
and oltlcial relaiious. As to on# of the reasons for
UK alleged disagreement between them? namely,
the nomination of General Picasonton as Commls

there was ro unseat irom any one in the Cabinet on

Mentor Schurz'* H|??*eh on Amnesty and
.IliMNOiiri FoiitlcH.
The sensation hi the Senate to-<lay was the speech
of senator henur/. In support of his Amnesty reso
lution. There was a lar?e number of spectators in
tbe galleries, and the sofas on the floor of the Sen
air chamber were well Ailed with members of the
lower bouse, it was expected that Schurz would
be quite severe upou tlie Fresidcut, as well as upon
Uh> members of the republican party In Mis
souri who opposed the (iratz Brown ticket in
lite late canvass. lUs references to the
{'resident personally, however, were rather dlirnlfled
than otherwise. The effector the speech was not
bo good as It would have txjen had the Senator de
livered it without the manuscript before him Scaurz
M ho good an impromptu speaker that everybody
was Hiirvriwd when he opened his portfolio wtth
ha speech carelully written. The general opinion
on both sides of the Senate ts t hat the speech was
very aide, ana that it will make more
or leas impression upou the public sentiment of
the country. There was some amusement created
b* that part of it wherein Schurz undertook to ex
pose what he called "the wire-pulling tactics of
the Missouri radicals." Senator Drake has the
floor for to-merrow, ami It Is said his reply will be
very bitter.
Tue P*? Ideal'# bi?-Mt In the Revival of
Commerce.
Mr. John Roach, of New York, who has taken
considerable Interest in the revival of American
couiiueroe. had a long interview with the President
yesterday. The President sent for Mr. Roach for
the purpose or learning his views on the subject.
The ITtwldeur will send to Congress a special mes
aage recommending action at the present session to
aid in reviving Ui ; shipping interests ol the country,
the Many Wive* ol Utah.
A lectitre on Monnonism, entitled as above, was
Oellvered this evening In Lincoln Hall, by Rev. .1. P.
Hewmao, D.U., Chapluln ol the United States
Senate, who last summer drew his two-edged
?word from its Old Te-tainont scabbard aud jour
neyed to tlie city of the Salnis, where he put brig
liain Younif to flight, and slew in argument Apostle
Pratt, nn polygamic representative. The lecture
was a thorough discussion of the Mormon qnes
tion in its social, civil and religious bear
ings, showing the contradictions and absur
dities on wuich it rested, its anomalous,
humorous and sorrowful aspects, full or fact
an <i ffitMtrntion, and abounding wtth telling hits
and pungent allusions. Dr. Newman began by
talcing up the Mormon lllble. Without discussing
Its merits or dcjucrtiu as a revelation, he adduced
fro ill its pages the condemnation ol polygamy. He
then passed to the pretended revelation or poly
gamy, and put the anmoval ol the latter by the
disapproval of the lornier. Ho rea I the dejual of
polygamy published I y Joseph Smith, when>oiieof
tlie elders of tue Mormon CUurcU had been pleach
ing that d??cirliie, and also read the diWual
of Parley P. Pratt, la 1S4... Against these
geveral denials was the testimony of Youtig to the
fact that Smith received revelation in isii. If
binltn told the truth then lirtgham did not. Ifbiulth
did not receive toe revelation tuen Uriguam's revi;
latiou was an Imposture. II Smith practised poly
(rainy witnout a revelation then ho was guilty of a
violation of the seventh commandment. If he hud
? revelation aud demed It, then, to use a scriptural
phrase. "He was * liar and the truth was not in
him." He showed the predicament In which
it placed the Almighty, who Is represented as
denouncing polygamy In 1S30 and justifying it in
1843. I)i. Newra.in then took up the position
and relations of wo;u;iu to the system, explaining
tlie Mormca Ideas of temporal and eie rnal wives
And Uielr doctrine df substitution, which allows
the wives an absent missionary to take a hus
band by ptfiXf. He dwelt particularly on the do
mestic rdgtlAns of the great prophet hunscir,
and went through lirlghain's whole harem
and brou^t eacn ^>f nia thirty wnes
upon tho fiiag-. He showed the salvatory
. economy of tji< Mormon system, and that grace aud
glory in tlie next world depend on the size of a
plan's family, ne explained the remarkable and
ingenious provk'ons of Mormon faith, which mikes
p'il vatiou retroactive through baptism and marriage
for the dead. The speaker graphically related the
, practical workings of the system, giving illustra
tions of the aoqutcscent, ihe stoical and the terma
gant women thai are found in Uiah. He ex
j>osed the pretentions of llrigliam Young as
?% seer and relator and ku nyioinlnlous
.failure as i prophet. Itrlgham predicted just before
JLee's sunt mler that the war would iast lour years
lon&er; bill (Jenerai .tfrant sasv lit to bring it to a
close sooner, llrlgbum prophesied iu 18i7 that he
would be Pfr.sldeni iu twelve j"ars. U!s expecta
tions liad failed lilm -so far; and as for 1H72, l)r.
Newman did not know who tlie democrats would
choose then, but he w&s certain Hie republicans
had made their choice. tApplaus .) He described
and denounced Brighaui's despotism and the system
which he controlled, and concluded in an eloquent
peroration, declaring that such a man os Young
jnust and Hiiotild t e put down, ami that Mormon -
ism as a despotism must cease unuer the flag oi.onr
country. It was the disgrace oi a past administra
tion that tho evil was aJlowed to go un
punlsed. It will be the glory ol this
administration ir the Iniquity is removed Irom the
face of the earih. Tins sentiment was greeted with
loud applause. The audience was frequently ex
cited to laughter at the doctors pointed wit, which
changed to sadnois when lie depicted the crying
evils of the systaiu, and found a vc'.it in applause
when he predicted its eud.

m tue cat-e of C. C. Edwins, indicted for the
embezzlement of $3 3r>o from toe redemption divi
sion or tho .L'nlte't States Treasury in September last,
the Jury to-day rendered a verdict if guilty, witn a
recommendation to the mercy of the Court. The
counsel gave notice or a motion lor a new trial. In
answer nit the prayer or tne counsel to instruct the
Jury th#c the act under which the indictment had
been found liad been repealed, Chief Justice Car tier
jylid;? ?
To Infer that Congress Intended to repeal the] act
would be to accuse thein or purpoteiy breaking

Bitcb conclusion.
't is understood that the counsel for Kdwina will
?ryue Uw ?jnes?l?n or repeal at ienirth when the ,
c??o comes np before t? court Id January next.
The declmou of Justice Car tier created some sur
prise among l tie members of tbe bar, from
the fact ttiat the question raised was not
what was Intended by the passage of the
act revising the Patent laws, but what
had been actually done according to the expressed
terras of the repealing clause.
Tut' Telegraph ('able Bill? St. Domlnfo, the
Alabama Claim* nn?t the New Dominion.
Tbe House Committee on Foreign Affairs had be
lore them to-day Mr. Wood s General Telegraph
Cafile bill, which they aVe now nearly ready to
report. They uLso discussed, without ooming to
any conclusion, Uie St. Domingo resolution of
General Banks, and those portions of the President's
Message relating to the Alabama cialms
.aud our relations with the Dominion
of Canada. At the next meeting of
the committee it Is understood that the St. Do
mingo resolution will come up for special considera
tion. The Senate Committee on Commerce agreed
to-Oav to report Senator Chandler's resolution au
thorizing the President, when In his judgment tlio
public interests require It, to auapend all laws of

Fred OouglmtH ii ud tbe Colored People'*
Organ*
The National Bra, started In this city several
years since a* the organ of the colored people of the
country, has again changed hands, and Frederick
Douglass, who lias been editing it for some months
past, announces in the issue ?f the paper to-day that
he will hereafter be its editor and publisher.
New Revenue Cutter*.
Secretary Boutwell has recommended to Congress
an appropriation or $300,000 for the building oi new
vessels for the revenue marine service. The amount
was appropriated two years ago, but some delay
was occasioned in receiving proposals, necessitating
a postponement of the contracts until some future
time. Under the act passed at the last session of
Congress that amount was conveyed Into the Trea
sury as an unexpended balance, requiring a new
appropriation If the work is to l>e done. The reve
nue marine service requires an increase of cutters,
and the recommendation of Secretary Bontwell
will probably bo favorably considered.
The Postal Teiexrnpli System.
The Select Committee on the Postal Telegraph held
a meeting to-day for the purpose of hearing an ar
gument from Mr. i. ubbard, of Boston. In reply to
the sj>eech of General Washburn In favor of the
Postal Telegraph bill. Mr: Hubbard has a scheme
of Ills own, which is for the government to build
an opposition line to that of the Western Union Corn
pauy. lie travelled over the Bame ground to-day
that he did last winter, making the same points and
coming to the same conclusion, namely? that all
other schemes besides his own are unwise and Im
practicable. Mr. Washburn, the chairman of the
committee, will probably make a reply to Mr. Hub
I bard.
I Mustering Out of Army Offl ers.
I The Setia'e committee on Military Affairs held a
I meeting to-day, and agreed to report a bill extend
ing the time for the mustering out or the army offi
cers, provided for in the Dill' which passed last ses
sion, from January, when it was to take effect, uutll
next July. The bill was afterwards reported to the
Senate. They also agreed to a bill providing for tue
payment ol the interest on the money advanced by
the States to the general government during the re
bellion.
The llevenuc Laws Relating to Sugar.
There were fifteen or tweuty persons berore the
Committee on Ways and Means to-day, and who are
engaged as importers, dealers and refiners or sugar.
Their object was to procure a modification ot the
present revenue laws relating to sugar. New York,
Boston, Philadelphia and Baliimore were repre
sented, and the Hen. L. A. Sheldon, or
Louisiana, a incmbar of the House, was
present in the Interest or the sugar planters
or the South. Secretary Boutwell was also in the
committee room anil took part In the proceedings,
which occupied at least two hours. The result of
the deliberations was that the committee agreed
upon and subsequently reported to the House a bill,
which conies up tor consideration to-morrow, strik
ing out rroin the provisions or the present law the
words '-raw" and "muscovado" wherever
they occur, so rar as the grades are below
thirteen, Dutch standard. The effect of
this will be that all sugars will now be classitled by
colors alone. It appears that sugars which are
muscovado, and thercrore below the grade thirteen,
have been Imported in considerable quantities,
when i heir real grade, judging lrom color, should be
i about thirteen. Muscovado sugar, above thirteen
In color, will, under the contemplated change, pay
one-hair or one per cent duty more than under the
law as it now exists, thereby benefiting the Louisi
ana interests.

more meritorious object could not enlist the
sympathy of the benevolent, wnile a gratcrul peo
ple will rejoice in ttie opportunity of showing their
patriotism in a maimer most glorious and substan

Army of the Republic, In aid of the "Union Home and
School for Soldiers' and .Sailors' orphans" promises
to be one of the most interesting of the many that
have recently been inaugurated. With a collection
of valuable articles such as are rafely presented for
sale, auction or lottery, and having
A MOST COMMENDABLE AIM,
there can be no hesitation lu predicting for the ex
hibition a triumph tfiat will perhaps surpass the
most sanguine expectations of Its charitable pro
motors. It is to enlarge the dimensions of the noble
institution, since the demand upon Its resources has
of late increased, that the fair has been neld. The
scene last evening was exceedingly eutertalnlng
lor, although the arrangements were not altogether
completed, the cheerfulness, beauty, elegance and
bright surroundings which characterized the exhi
bition were most gratifyiug.

decorations, neat and tempting tables, a beautiful
floral temple, attended by the most lascinating dam
sels, bewitching loveliness at every turn, a splendid
collection of paintings and a multitudinous variety

At eight o clock the exhibition was fairly under
way, and was inaugurated under circumstances the
most auspicious. All the spacious rooms of the
armory were thrown open and the music of the
band rrom Governor's island sounded merrily
through the building. A guard of honor, consist

attendance, and as ^

THE HEBREW FAIR.
Tho Crowd I.nst ICveninK? Some of llic Bi(
Frizen to be "Knocked Down" To- Night.
The Hebrew Fair rooms, In Fourteenth street, were
crowded last night as tbey were never crowded
before since it was opened, lu fact, it was almost
an Impossibility for a lady who had any rettard
whatever for the entirety of her fashionable "get
up" to make her way from one table to another with
out running tne risk of being unmercifully divided
into lnflnitesslmal pieces. The floor committee
were at their wits' end how to accommodate the
multitudes which kCpt pouring In uirougn the
entrance way during the evening, ana had It not
been lor their activity and untiring evertlous it is
quite probable that Alderman Uarl would have bee#
compelled to Issue a proclamation prohibiting the
doom from being opeuod alter in no o'clock.
The gentlemen who had charge of the magic
wheel, out of which tbe chance tickets are drawn,
were kept quite butty, as they have been during the
previoua evenings, in deciding the late of shawls;
chairs, cushions, and what not, all which went to
make up the minimum bortum of the many nice
things that were "set up to be knocked down" to
some lucky people. Indeed, that perUon of tbe
room immediately in rront of their stand was
blocked np bo completely all the evening
by the eager hundreds, each one of whom
stood patiently for hours at a time wait
ing u> hear Ills or her name called out as that of
a winner, that locomotion was out of the question.
Over too articles upon which chances had bee%
taken were rallied off and as muny individual*
mode happy. This evening Home of the larger
prizes will be rallied off, when It is expected all the
claims allotted to every article of value will have
been taken.
In the "One Hundred Prize" series drawn lost
evening tickets Nob. l,2?7 aud 2,028 won grand

of the church. Handsome ladles, lively music, val
uable und useful articles, plenty of run and oppor
tunities to assist a, geod work are the inducements
presented, They have so far been very successful,
ami as t He fair Is to continue during tins and tho
next week, tne "aid" acquired for the church will,
no doubt, be quite "material."
LEC UIIES LAST NIGHT.
"SCIENTIFIC TRIUMPHS."
Lecture Lini Evening by Prolwmor DoretniiM,
at AsHoeintion IImII? A Brilliant and In
I crested Audience.
Last evening Professor Doreuius delivered tbe third
of his course or lectures, on "Scientific Trlamphs,"
before the Young Men's Christian Association, at
their hall, at the corner of Fourth avenue and Twen
ty-fourth street. These lectures are already proved
to be an Immense success, and no doubt popular
scientific discourses will becotno as fashionable an
entertainment In New York as the lucid eloquence
and striking experiments of Faraday made them in
London, hast night tho audience was oven
larger than at the previous lectures; indeed,
scarcely standing room was left. All through Uie
evening, thanks to the iasclnating manner in which
the Professor explained and Illustrated his theme,
the Interest or his hearers never flagged, while at
times there was an outburst of genuine and hearty
enthusiasm, is or was the lecturc unmarked with
several amusing episodes. In several of tbe ex
periments chlorine was employed, and as its iumes
swept, through the hall, there was an epidemic out
break ot subdued coughing, which provoked consid
erable merriment.
Alter recapitulating the various principles in re
gard to tho combination of the elements explained
til his last lecture, the Professor said tue metals
were rarely lound in a native state; they had "loves"
or affinities with many oilier subsiauces. As an
illustration, he would cite gold, silver ami iron,
which were Bcarcely ever found pure. When Iron
ores were mingled with carbon aud lime
In a furnace, aud a blast of pure *alr
applied balow, the iron associated with a
little carbou, aud ran out In a stream resembling
somewhat a sow, and consequently known as pig
iron. No one subject now e.oiniuanded more atten
tion iroiu chemists than the production and manu
facture of iron. An analysis of the crust of the
earth allowed how largely oxygen had entered into
its combination. Chemists announced that the basis
of clay was a beautiful white metal, cailcd alum
inum. The I'refCHSor then showed how a slight
difference in the proportions in whicn other ele
ments were mingled with alumina resulted In the
numerous forms of clay, some ot winch were suited
for the manufacture <n the most beautiful kinds of
porcelain, while others were used for making coarse
tiles and pottery of all kinds. In the Jilble it was
stated that men were made of clay ; but it might
be said in passing that the metal which formed the
basis oi that substance was almost the only one not
iouud by chemists In the human iranie. Doubi.'ess
the liiblical reading ought to be earth.
Tbe Professor next again returned to the dis
coveries brought to light by spectrum analysis, liy
tills means several new metals had already been
discovered. Then, as another proof of lis value, it
might be stated that metallic poisons could now be
detected with sufficient precision for the purposes ol
a court of Justice. Only a few years ago he had ob
tained proof of ihe presence of arsenic lu a body
alter it had been interred twelve months. These
modern refinements were due mainly to the spec
troBcope. Sulphur in a pure and crystallised state
was found at tbe mouth of volcanoes, and also in
combination with many metals, it was very useful,
especially as from it was manufactured sulphuric
acid, or ihe king of acids. The mode of manu
facturing this acid was then illustrated, oil
of vitriol applied to common salt resulted in
hydrochloric acid, with a residue ol soda.
&0 1 III frorlnn* w??r? r>ul lh?*, wltun lU?* who
obtained It from volcanoes endeavored to get a
Higher price for their wares, no less inau fiitcen new
patents for its manufacture wero taken out. From
hydrochloric acid we get ehlonue, which if mingled
with coloring matter, like indigo and lime, had the
power of removing tne color. This discovery was
one of the inosi important ever discovered.
Chlorine was also the most powerful disinfect
ant known. A few years ago a cabin In one
of the Cunard steamers, which had been
infected with smallpox, had been effectually
cleansed by this wonderful gas. It was
a rather shameful fact that nearly ull the caustic
soda now used In tills country was imported, a
fact which showed the necessity, among other
things, of providing higher means of scientific edu
cation among us. Sulphur also combined with
nulla rubber and formed a singularly beautiful
substance, out of winch the well known India rubber
trotting wagon was made. He believed this sub.
stance would at no distant date be employed more
generally than at present. The Professor then
ulludcd to Mons. Tessiers' method of obtaining
oxygen cas? a method Involving scarcely any ex
pense. This was oi the last importance, as oxygen
was the essential element of heat and tue. lie then
referred to the production of phosphorous, which
was now procured from bones. Compounds of
phosphorous were especially important to the
human system, a-1 they seemed essential to intellec
tual effort. Butter, among other articles, contaiucd
a palpable quantity or tins Important substance.
Probably tho Sun produced its heat by chemical
combustion. Some physicists maintained that a
slight condensation of Its surface would enable it to
maintain this heat-giving power for thousands and
millions or years, and others believed that the loss
It thus sustained was made up by the occasional at
traction of lorelgn bodies. Attempts have been
made to find out the quantity or heat thrown out by
the Sun. und It had been calculated that our Earth
absorbed only threw hundred thousand millionth
part of the total amount, as our Earth is but a
rusied mass ot molten meta', so, perhaps, is the Sun
undergoing tho same process from which the Earth
hud emerged. Hut the Sun was not the only source
or the heat absorbed by our Earth. Twelve millions
or suns were constantly ditftislug light upon its sur
face. Then we had internal sources oi' heat, such
as volcanoes; and artificial heat, such as that caused
by all movement or by chemical action? tne latter
?onrce being, perhaps, the more important of the
two.
Professor Doremus closcd by some interesting ex
periments in regard to light.
FACTS ABOUT THE MIND.
Lfriurf by Rev. Dr. Daryra,
Dr. Duryea delivered the second of h?a course of
lectures oh mental science before tiie Brooklyn
Young Men's Christian Association last night. He
began by referring to the war that lias been carried
on uuring the last eentury between the
forces within man and without, or the sub
jective and objective philosophers, and showed
that the iu aterlallut cannot slop short of
Pantheism, and that the opposite doctrine leads
to Idealism. After showing that there would
be no smell if there were no nose and nosoutidir
Were were 110 ear, and that all objects winch
deluded man fondly supposes he beholds are 'Mil lu
his eve." The lecturer proceeded to get his audi
ence otit of the fog in which lor the sake of argu
ment lie had enveloped them. The clearing up pro
cess was very satisfactory to the large audience,
who were, no doubt, gratified to And that they were
real peisons in a real world, alter seeing themselves
and their surroundings changed by incontrovertible
Reasoning into thin air.

Shipping Notes.
Owing to the strong NVV gale of yesterday the arrivals via
Sandy Hook were very few.
The schooner yAchts being built at the Bhlpyard of Mr. S.
H. Pine, Greenpolnt, Tor Messrs. George and Louis liorll
lard, are progressing finely towards completion. The keel
boat lor the former, should nothing occur meanwhile, will
be launched on Monday next, and the work of finishing her
internally and externally prosecuted with such vigor that it
will not be many weeks before she Is rtfady for sea, when her
owner, it is believed, will leave this port for an extended
cruise in the Caribbean sea and subsequently up the Mediter
ranean. This yacht, as also the centreboard schooner,
was modelled' by Mr Robert Fish, who expects great results
from them in the way of stability sufficient to encounter
all kinds of weather and great speed. . Bbe is 109 feet long
on the water li ne, 24 feet beam, 12 feet 6 inches depth of
hold and of about 163 tons burden . Her foremast is 88 feet
in length ; mainmast, 86 feet ; ioretopmast, 43 feet ; maintop
mast, 46 feet; main boom, 70 feet.
The centreboard yacht for Mr Louis Lorillard was not
commenced until [some six weeks later than his brother's, and
therefore Is not so far advanced ; but her planking Is nearly
completed and In every particular there is observed a dispo
sition of her builder to soon have her ready for launching.
This boat is 100 feet long on the water line, 23 feot beam,
7 feet 8 inches depth of hold and will be of about 200 tons
burden. In several respects the models of these yachts are
very peculiar, but It is claimed that the Innovations are
based upon well-known naval architectural! laws, and suc
cess will be result of the efforts. It is certain, however, that
their construction has demonstrated the progressive spirit of
American yachtmen, and it is to be hoped that all the antici
pations of those interested? owners, builder and modeller
will be fully realized.
Like remarks will fitly apply to the schooner yacht now
being built at the shipyard of the Messrs. PoiJiion for Capt
Samuels. She Is progressing very favorably, and will pro
bably be launched about the last of February. This yacht
measures 1U3 feet on the water line, 24 feet breadth of beam,
11 feet depth of hoM, and will be about 245 tons burden.
The materials nsed in the construction of the three yachts
are first class in every particular, and the intended manner
of their cabin decorations will be oPthat character as to
place tbem prominently among the most elegant of the many
vessels in the pleasure navy of the New Vork Yacht Club.
Work has been commenced on the hulls and engines of tho
Iron boats intended for the Union Ferry Company, to be run
on the Fulion ferry. The Continental Works of Creenpoint
will build the hulls, while the (Julntard Works of this city
will construct the engines, the castings for which are now
being made. Tho engines will be of the inclined description,
with cylinders 40 inches In diameter by 10 feet stroke of pis
ton. Six months will be required to complelo these boats.
