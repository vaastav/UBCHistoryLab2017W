Received By The

PARKERSBITRO, Dec. f 16.?Sec
retary of Stale Charles W. Swisher
spent Sunday afternoon in -this city.
He was enroute to the eastern part I
of the state op business. While

They were tfhose interested In the
success of his candidacy for the Re

and his lieutenants in this immedi
ate section-.
It was a cheerful and sanguine
party, and the Secretary of State.
Mr. Swisher, spoke hopefully and
confidentally of the outlook for the
j success of his ambition. It was the
! opinion of Mr. Swisher and his
? friends that all effort to get another
candidate into the race ;would
amount to naught, and that the con
test will go to a finish between Mr.
Swisher and Mr. Schorr.
Whatever development may oc-1
i cur, Mr. Swisher let it be known to |
his friends 'here thta he was In the
fight to the end. that nothiing would
or could occur, save death and se
rious sickness, to take him out of
the fight. He intimated that he was
the first in the field and would be
the last to leave It. and that he con
sidered that he had all the best of
the argument up to this time and
expected to win out handily In con
vention.

Advise* Strikers As To Action On
The Wage Scale At Local
Factories.
Editors of Telegram:
>Vc wish to add a fact or two to
whfct has been written on the window
glass "muddle."
Up to the time the present wage
settlement was made, all West Vir
ginia manufacturers and nearly all
others In other States who are operat
ing by the "hand blown method," cm
ployed no one In any of the four skill
ed trades except members of the
Amalgamated Window Glass Workers
<>f America. Therefore, West Virginia
manufacturers made a settlement with
the above labor organization for all
four trades on Dec. 7, and have the
signatures of all four trades to the
contract, through the proper officials.
Without any warning whatever, two
of the four trades (cutters and flat
teners) quit our plants. They are
now strikers for last year's wages or
its equivalent and claim to be mem
bers of another organization.
In answer to their argument that
there Is no necessity for reducing cut
ters' and flatteners' wages, permit me
to answer their argument in part In
tills manner. The same box of glass
that was selling last year for $1.80 and
on which we were paying the present
demands for cutting and flattening, Is
now selling for $1.50. Of the 40
cents shrinkage, under the present
scale, we ask the blower to stand 12
cents, the gatherer 9 cents, the cutter
:! cents, the flattener .1 cents, nnd we
stand the remaining- IS cents. The
blower, gatherer and ourselves are
willing to make the sacrifices. The
llatteners and cutters are willing to
make none. When the price on glass
returns to that of one year ago, viz:
90 and 10 off the list all wages are
more than restored as It will be 40 per
cent advance. Can any proposition
be fairer? ?
Some of .the cutters' and flatteners
missionaries here have frightened our
workmen by assorting the machines
can sell glass at a profit of 90 aim 60
and when this occurs they will be
working for $10.00 per week. This is
rather amusing. The above discount
would mean an Average net price of
80 cents per box for glass which Is far
below the fixed charge on their glass
before they pay anything for skilled
labor. With the market price moix
than 22 per cent, below last year. Is It
fair for cutters and llatteners to de
mand last years' wages? Why should
they not be willing to join hands with
blowers, gatherers and manufactur
ers in meeting the situation?
It is a fact that the cutters and flat
teners employed at "machine plants"
ha\;e based their wages every year up
on wages paid these trades In "hand
blown plants." They now coine to
our employees and beseech them to
quit work in order to establish the
order reversed. Very clever, as It in
volves no loss of time for themselves
and makes our employees the strikers.
By the way It looks rather selfish as
they havo had steady work for four
teen months while our employees have
had six or seven, and have no prospect
or hope whatever of winning this
fight, as it is simply Impossible to com
ply with the demands.

TO STAND FIRM
SAY STRIKERS
\ *
Flat toners and Cutters Are Encour
aged And Will Not Yield
To Sliding Scale.
Messrs. A. P. Fees and C. W. Mc
Fall, of the wage scale committee of
the Window Glass Cutters and Fiat
teners Association, gave out the fol
lowing statement Monday:
"The men are highly pleased with
the situation and arc ilrmer than
ever. They will resist a reduction un
der the Amalgamated scale. Local
manufacturers have made a dlscrim
; illation in paying their men that is
unprecedented. Such tactics only
strengthen' the strikers. President
Shinn was called to Pittsburg to con
fer with President Healy of the Win
day Glass Manufacturers Association
and a communication received here
this morning from him states that he
bad received word from manufactur
ers throughout the country asking for
an early conference on the wage scale.
He also stated that he had received
new signatures of the scale yesterday
and today.
"As to conditions at the local fac
tories, the Adamston plant is practical
ly out of operation and the West Fork
Is the same. At the Tuna there is
one flntetnlng oven running. The
Pereless is running but Is short of
men. The flatteners and cutters at
the L?afayette are working their notice
out under the old scale. Current re
ports about plants here and elsewhere
being fully manned are false. Cam
eron. Weston, llcirgantown and Fair
mont factories have closed down. The
mountain district is firm and the fac
tories that are operating are doing bo
satisfactory to our section. Some
local manufacturers have stated that
they would sign the scale if the others
would. Others claim they cannot for
financial reasons. Two Ohio firms op
erating at a high cost of fuel under
our scale proves this to be a false
impression. The sliding scale as sign
ed by Clarksburg manufacturers is an
tagonistic to the United Window Glass
Manufacturers Association of which
they are members. This is an organ
ization of manufacturers operating by
the hand process. The sliding scale
was signed by local manufacturers
secretly In Cleveland while at the
same time the United Window Glass
Manufacturers Association was con
vening in Pittsburg, at which place
they were'also represented. ??We hope
to sign the scale with the manufac
turers association early this week."

Candidacy.

(Sparlal to Til* Teloerain.)
CHARLESTON. Dcc. 16-?Kanawha
county, always teeming with politic*,
is no less absorbed in her own affairs
at this early stage of he same, but
notwithstanding this there arises above
it all the manifest question of the gub
ernatorial race in the Republican par
ty. The most striking feature of the
situation In this and all counties of
southern West Virginia, is the steady,
gradual support which has been com
ing voluntarily to Secretary of State
Swisher. .
No newspaper correspondent, with
half an eye to fairness and the truth
of the drift of things, can fall to note
the Swisher centlment which haa been
Increasing with the days since his plat
form was given to the people.
Said a former office holder of
Kanawha county this morning: "This
man Swisher has captivated our peo
ple down here by his straight forward
position throughout this contest, and
while others have busied themselves
with circulating rumors this way and
that, of one sort and the other, Mr.
Swisher has issued his platform and
rests In a dignified manner 'upon his
oars," receiving the voluntary proffers
of support of old friends and new"
Secretary of State Swisher's office
has been a perfect mecca of visitors
from the various counties throughout
this part of the State. It reminds one
of the old McKlnley receptions at
Canton. Anybody may see him when
he calls and he finds the office already
flll&i with Republicans from near and
remote counties. More chairs are
brought in and the iewcomer Joins
with those ajready present in wishing,
the Secretary of State well in his can
didacy. The rise of the Swisher tide
Is spontaneous, something unusual
down here, and that he appreciates
this manifestation of support goes
without saying. "It's his straightfor
ward, manly platform," said one man
from Fayette today. "I believe It Is
the personality of the man," chimed
in another admirer. "Yes," said the
third, "and his rise In public life ap
peals to young and old. It is rather ro
mantic, and he appears to have made
good all around," to which all agreed.
A State senator who lives in a coun
ty in the Third Congressional district
sat in the lobby of Hotel Kanawha to
day'and with a group of acquaintances
some from northern counties, said this
in the hearing of the correspondent:
"For my part I had not given .much,
thought to Mr. Swisher's gubernatorial
aspirations until he Issued his plat
form. I read it thoroughly several
times and so did numerous of my
friends. It Is a document of strength
and Is without equivocation or evasion.
No platform was ever handed out by
a gubernatorial candidate before or
since, upon which he bases his candi
dacy, and I have heard hundreds of
men declare themselves for Mr.
Swisher since they have had time to
thoroughly digest the planks ol his
platform.
"The Republicans need a leader In
this race, a born, leader for the head
of the ticket during the campaign next
year. They need a man who stands
out In the open where all may see him.
and such a man I am now convinced
is Secretary of Stato Swisher. I
