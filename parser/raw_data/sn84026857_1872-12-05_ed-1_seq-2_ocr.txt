THE DEATH OF MR. GREELEY. ! i
The death of Horace Greeley, on
Friday last. aged, sixty-two, has more
wotiAn tliin jliQf nf
ueepiy an trim iuc u<ttivn m.... i.,H? v.
any man since Lincoln died. His vigorous
constitution and careful habits <
nromisod many years of usefulness, but
his brain succumbed to the anxiety and [
grief incident to the illness and death of
his wife, combined with the fatigues of
the lute campaign and a morbid feeling of j
responsibility' for its resnit. It was
not so much a wounded vanity for his
own defeat. Tt assumed more the
oaaractcr of self-reproach for fear, as he
believed, that at a crisis in the nation's
history, lie should have stood in the way
of some one who might, if a candidate,
have accompli.died more for the cause he ;
'had so much at heart, and for the prq- i
motion of the general welfare.
.Such a feeling was characteristic of the j
man. but will be-incomprehensible to the \
ordinary politician;
We refrain from comments on his life i
and character, but refer our readers to |
tfiosc ol others in anomer cwiumu.
Messages.
Three in one week is too ninny. The
President's we will give in full next week.
Scott's is the same old defense of his administration?the
ku-klux and the
democratic papers did it all; great eon
fiuence in providence and in the justice
of future gen rations. Moses must also
rake up the ku-klux, promises to he
good, entreats the support of the ' former
ruling element," flatters the "present
ruling elem nt," complements Judge
Mackey, Gov. Scott and?Horace Greeley.
Difim't Enough.
The Colleton Gazette, owned and
edited by Geo. F. Me In tyre, an ultraradical
state Senator, has the following in
its editorial columns:
"We accuse you. Franklin Judas
Moses, Jr.*, first, with buying horses with
pay certificates; deny it it yon can. We i
accuse you of paying your debts with
pay certificate ; controvert it if you
phase.. We accuse you of giving a
($20,000) twenty thousand dollar (only
think of it!) pay certificate to certain
parties to raise five thousand dollars, li
you want, the witnesses we can bring
them forth. We accuse you of getting
certain nineteen thousand dollar? worth 1
of bonds, which a certain person held as 1
collateral security, along with a promise j
of a certain note for your ruling on-the .
impeachment question. Do you want I
me as a witness'!
In our Columbia letter will be fount! a
circular signet! by Ktlwin E. Gary, bring- i
ing charges equally definit against Gov. <
Scott and Joint Patterson. It would '
seem impossible that such direct and <
public assertions could be passed over
without action, either by those affected
by them or by grand juries. Put they '
will be.

Congress.
Congress re-assembled at noon on .
Monday.- Both houses adopted the fol-' j
lowing resolution: ;,
Itesoh-f'lhy the Senate and House of 1
Representatives, iti view of the recent i ,
death of Horace Greeley, fur whom at
the late election more than three million 1
of votes were east for President. That a
iceord be made in the journals of Congress
ot the appreciation fi-r the eminent
services and personal purity and worth of
the deceased, and of the saw impression
created by his death following a keen '
ihmily bereavement.
The President's message was then .
read. It is almost entirely destitute of j '
pditscal significance, it simply db. u- \,s
our fbreign relations and domestic financial
and iiidtistfLl intore.-ts. We will
give the document entire in a supple
rnent to the Rkitblican next week.

OUR COLUMBIA LETTER.
Columbia, Nov. 30.
The adjournment from Wednesday nniJ
Mnnday lias given to the members and
he new executive officers a time for con
u I ta t ion and discussion, which will posiibly
save us much talk in the t wo houses,
it is almost certain that a tax of thirteen
uills will be proposed by the adiuinistrnion,
six for general purposes, two for i
'chools and five for deficiencies. Ilonjstlv
and judiciously expended, this tax ;
s ample to run the state an 1 pay the ar- i
ears due the schools, state institutions,
salaries and regular appropriations,
heaving interest on the debt, pay certificates,
notes, Blue Kidge claims, etc., to j
loat as best they may until the present j
pasm of retrenchment has passed away. I
Senator Sawyer J rvr arrived and enters j
he ncc with good spirit. The other j
raudidates speaks derisively of his
ihances, hut if he can unite the conserva
fives on hi:n he will have a better showng
chan h<v> been thought, lie ha.*- j
unity warm letters w his favor front re- i
mbiican senators and from Grant and
Wibon. These letters are very credita- !
>le to hint but he would Cud letters of j
-redit more useful when it comes to r
rotes.
Rumor says that next week the canvas j
ivill be enlivened by histories of the
rhree principal candidate*. Scott and
Elliott are to furni-h tlie materials for
that of Patterson; Patterson and Elliott
for that c: Scott, and Patterson and Scott
tor that of Elliott. If they should tell
ill they know of one another the public
wiil be interested. Scott is reported to
ftavc sent an emissary to Pennsylvania
joins week- ago to collect items of Patterson's
history there. It is not known
ivhcther Ohio and Massachusetts have !
jeett similarly ransacked for the records
)f Scott and Elliott. One would think it
tnneccssary to leave Colmribia for the j
jurpose; If the histories of the Blue j
llidge railroad, impeachment, validating j
tml settlement bills, with dashes at j
irmed force, Mooney, LeggeM, and other j
rides, are not sufficient to elect one or
tli to the 1/. S. Senate, it isu e!e-s to go I
uriher. Any one of them is qua'ificd to ;
lie his seat along with (Mm-rut, Moron.
Posneroy or Caldwell without fear of j
teing thought gtve j in the '"ways that I
ire d.irk aud trick - that are vain. :
Sawyer may take a hand iu the game,
lis re. earthes during the late campaign
nay have resulted in his {hiding some 1
hing won by,of appearing before a grand
ury. If so, we hope ho wiil bring it
>ut.

an article on White Ilall Ferrv, and in tj1(}
said, article you stated: "Jlion, again
they purchased a building for a poor u (
house and sold it sometime afterward for ,
con-iderable less than they paid for it.
The magnificent court house, &c.'' j
In all that has been said in the press CQU,
about the county commissioners, I have scg
been silent and whatever reply may be ! ne,v
made to this I shall make no answer | jt>^)
There is only one thing I regret having | ^
done and that is purchasing a tract of j C()U
land of Mr. Pollitzer for a poor farm. j j
After the deed was made out and pre- j j^0.
sented to the board, I refused to sign it i ^
alleging that I had been to .Mr. Crofut, j V)-|j(
Mr. Waterhouse and -Mr. Coltins, and v
a>ked their assistance to get for thccoun- ; v|j:(
ty about I'd acres. At the next meeting j jJ(H1
1 - . \ ' .,
tU'.'lf lJUllij? IIU \Jki\~l iiUiu nu; wuvi fll'
milted and I reported of it afterward* a> ,u)
31 r. Crofut informed mc that he had u1(r
made an offer of about 20 acres in writ- ?: c
ing and gave it to on? of the commi-sieu- jr|Jf
er.s. Said commissioner kept it in his t|,e
pocket. I was compelled to submit as . jie
on two or three occasions. We were ] ]>
repremanded by the jnaRvl jury lor
keeping the poor in the jail. I aho j
protested again it the acceptance of the ; ^
White llali Ferry from the merchants oh
Beaulbrt for the same reasons as yon r*p
give. It was represented by the other
two commissioners that ?he flat would : ^
pay all the expenses and I insist confes- i
I submitled against my own judgment,
after a great deal of abu e from the peo])le
of Beaufort. Bis
In regard to the purchase of the court o
house I consider 1 acted with judgment. ?
31 r. Judd becoming acquainted that the
commissioner, would purchase, it was de- a
cidfcd by the board of commissioners | IU(l
that lie should be the agent, lie in- :
firmed us that lie thought tin court u;!.,
house could bo bought for ?10 u. !{<
was instructed to pus chase as low asI{,(t,
po.-siMe as we did not desire llie j-;ntie; (0!1
to know that we would purchase. In ro- j
ply to me lie infbr.nod the 1 oi/d .hat ii
wold' i only charge'for the making out of!
deed and recording tlie cam ? when 1 u
wa-.-a! sent three ch.: :ks Were issued tor ??.
500, 300 and --X) ro -p r-tively. This j
looked su>i.iic;ou.s to me an 1 i learned by ,
* **l8'
inquiry of Dr. Tiioiupon? that 3ir. min
Judd had cleared one of those checks. w"
L became indignant and at tlie next
meeting of tic board L moved that 3Ir. i i
Judd be comp< itod to return the cheeks, | :,r -
bat I was not supported by oinior one ui
the comm is ion ei a. j a,
I)r. Thompson aVo informed me that ' T!
if he knew the county were to buy he ; Vk:'
would have asked more. :'?
The building at Hilton Head was j.;.i
bought to move on Mr. Pollitzer's farm ''sj1
tor a noor imn-c. I wa? the liartv in- iM
'i i i r > * i t i rtw
structea to buy, ami I considered 1 ;yi.t
bought cheap, as the same building was ;
sold at auction and no loss was sustained J
by the county. I jgj?'
The contract for the balding of the n
poor house was given to the lowest bid- [..-i';'
derv Mr. Brodic, and it was well under- *
stood that the com ,actor would have to
M 0
wait 10 months for his money. I know | inof

r. Grot-Icy was married July 16, 1856, in In>tiel
Church, Warreitton, North Carolina, by Rev.
. Norwood, to Miss Mary Y. Cheney, of Warrenloiuicrly
of New Xorlc. His wife was by proon
a teacher. The acquaintance had b"cn
led at the Graham House, and was contiuue<l by
jspoiideaee alter 51 iss Cheney, in the pursuit of
vocation, had removed to North Carolina. The
is understood to have possessed high intellectual
>wmen;s, and run* aoniesuc virtues must ua?u
i great to have * cured such profound uud pcre.it
devotion as Sir. Greeley snowed to her.
r. Greeley's private character was singularly puretree
from everything of a vicious or corrupting
ire, even from his early vottlh and through all
riciasitudes of fortune. When poverty pinched
I upon him, and hi? early life was one of toil and
ilt tiial, his innate integrity protected him against
temptations that his genius op-pnd before him
irrupt practices. His temper, it is true, was
:ihL\ but those who kucw him best indulged his
ntricities, knowing that under such an exterior
ted a rich mine of worth never obscured when
r demanded its treasures.
i bis private rehuious there was uo man more
Ud and relied upon than Mr. Greeley, liis
nishijw were based upon true worth, derived . ,
i his ki rn but apparently unsophisticated d?ruent
of character, and his influence and offices,
d be relied upou in any emergency. He wa?
til-iri^ uanpy in liis domestic relations. His
,sof it and duties, Ins literary pursuits, even iu
r idmync acies, wore In accord w ith the opinions

viat-.-d ttic poverty of his early etlbrts Mr.
cley's religious rciiex' was that of a Unitarian
location ist. He says iu a letier to the 11cv. J. M.
tin: "1 believe thatthenior.il character formed
his life will be that in which we shall awake in
