WKINKMCa IN THE CAPTAIN'S RROW
COMPDICATIONg RE* A'.'SB OF
VARIOrs REDIGIONS
Car"?'" Hostler of the British tramp steamer
Wennington Hall, which came Into this port yes?
terday morning, has boca havlnp his troubles for
the last two months. Languages mHI religions
have been at the bottom of the whole affair?not
the absence of religion, but Its presence In large ,
and various quantities. The Wennington Hall
left TJllatJap, Java, on Reptember 24, but when J
she got to Colombo, In the Island of Ceylon, all j
but eight of the crew deserted. The captain j
found himself far? to face with two alterna- j
?ives. One was to wait three weeks for another !
crew to arrive from Bombay. The other was to ?
collect a new crew In Colombo. He chose the
lattar alternative, and, wandering through the
streets of Colombo with his two mates, he picked ,
up such a crew as has probably never before ??
trod the deck of one vessel. The motley mob j
Included Arabs. Bad Indlamen, Perniane, ?
Frenchmen. Hermans, Chinese and Lascara. In
eataf It was everything, from white to blackest
black. In religion It was Christian, Buddhist, ?
Mahometan, I'arsee, Jalnlst and Theosophlcal. |
In temper, according to Captain Hostler, It was
exceedingly bad.
From Colombo to New-York the captain's life j
was made one long nightmare. He delivered
himself yesterday of uncomplimentary language
about his crew. They didn't want to work. In
the first place. In the second place, they didn't
know how. and. In the third rlace, they were too
much occupied with their own personal dis?
agreements to work. If they had known how. A
haughty Mahometan named Mohammed Ferrai
was In charge of the stokers, and he refused to
speak to any one but the members of his own
faith. "Me Allah man." he said scornfully.
"They no Allah man." Then he drove his pang
Into the ftreroom with Oriental curses. The re
llgiOM differences of the ere? broke out almost ?
dally.
When a Mahometan went below ard discov?
ered a Buddhist at worship he promptly picked
up the nearest coal scuttle and smote the un?
believer over the head therewith. When n-xt
that Buddhist discovered that Mahometan fac?
ing toward Mecca at sunset he effectually dis?
turbed that worthy's prayers with the handiest
belaylng-pln. The Christians among the crew
were smitten from every direction while It was
next to Impossible to get an Aarah to pull on f
the same rope with a Lascar The captain and :
his mates did what little they could with be
laylng-plns and horny fists to discourage this
exchange of courtesies, but the heads of the
crew were exceeding tough.
"Blow me. If I ever pee seen bloomln' 'ard
'?ads," Fays Captain Hostler, to which his mates
respond earnestly in chorus Blow me, too!"
When the steamer was In the R^d Sea one ;
of the East Indiameli rebelled and Jumped
overboard. The captain ordered a beat lowered
and the crew dragged the would-be suicide from
the grave he desired. At Suez five of the Lascars
deserted, and more Arab? were shipped. They
stirred up race strife afresh
The Mahometans firmly declined to eat pork
ir.d religiously starved theme?!vea when there
ta no beef provided. The Lascara declared
iJia.1 their ??Ieirllll forbade them eating the flesh
Of any animals they did not kill themselves. So '
the captair had bought six sheep at Colombo
for their especial benefit. Five of the sheep had ?
leen eaten when the steamer arrived off Dela?
ware Breakwater, and the Laacarf were about
te sacrifice the sixth when they discovered that
Um animal war with young and they refused
to kill It. saying that any Lascai who did such
a thing would be everlastingly accursed by his
forefathers back to the sixth and seventh gen
eratlons. The captain responded that lie could
not take the sheep into port because the quaran?
tine regulations forbade the importation of live
?teck from East Indian ports The Lascar ? ?
ferred. and at lest reported that thep would
reimburse the captain for any fines he mi.rht ;
suffer, even to the full extent of Huir ?.alarles, ?
if he would only spare the sheep. The sh? ? ?
was spared, ar.d gave birth to a lamb that died
at once and was cast overboard.
When the Weanlngton Hall arrived yesterday ;
morning and anchored off Liberty Island th?
crew were in an unenviable condition. Most of
them were suffering from the cold, as they were
loosely dressed in Oriental costume, and were
hare-legged. A physician was called to attend
them. The sheep was cooped up In ? warm cas?
on deck and ai peared more comfortable than
her preservers, the Lascars. The Wennlngton
Hall will next proceed to Brunswick, and when
she leaves that port with a cargo of lumber for
Liverpool Captain Hostler ezpectl mor? trouble.
The saddest part o? the whole proc?? .ng is
that he cannot g?t rid of his motley err .? until
next September, for he had to hire them for a
year or he couldn't get them at all. That Is
why he wears a worried look and curses the
sailors of Arabia, Ceylon and other Oriental
points of interest with fervor and enthusiasm.

MINISTER nOSf?l RETURNS.
SAID TO HAVE IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION'S
FROM JAPAN AS TO HAWAII.
San Francisco, Dm. f>.--Toru Hosht. Knvny
I Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary
from Japan to the United Htates, wan a pas?
senger from the Orient on the steamer City of
Peking. He left here tn-nlght for Washington,
carrying with him Important Instructions In
reference to the Hawaiian treaty of annexa?
tion, which will be considered by the United
Ptates Senate.
Several months ago he hurriedly left Wash?
ington for Japan. He started Just after the
publication of his correspondence with Secre?
tary Sherman with reference to the Hawaiian
question. Dispatches from Washington declared
that he was angry with Mr. Sherman and the
Administration for their advocacy of annexa?
tion.
"I know," he said, "that my recent trip to
Japan has been misconstrued by some of the
American newspapers. I believe my relations
with the Washington authorities are amicable.
My relations with Secretan' Sherman are not
strained. I desire to say positively that Japan
Is opposed to the annexation of Hawaii by the
United States. The recent reports that Japan '
had withdrawn her opposition are untrue.
Japan has certain Interests In the Sandwich j
Islands which the United StAtes should respect.
1 believe this matter will be armlcably adjusted. |
There may be serious trouble If the United
States annexes the Islands without regard to
our Interests there. But I do not believe the
United States will act unfairly. Japan Is very
friendly with this country, and there Is cer?
tainly a way by which the annexation question
can be settled satisfactorily to both great na?
tions. I return with certain Instructions from
my Government.
"Japan has In the Hawaiian Islands about
twenty thousand of icr people. Hawaii ha? a
treaty with Japan permitting the latter to send
Immigrants there, and also Import? for the use
of the latter. Ha< nil has viol?t? d this treaty,
and our claim for this violation has not been
fettled. We want nur claim settled after an?
nexation, if not before that time. Hawaii de?
ported some of our Japanese immigrants That
was in violation of her treaty with Japan
Hawaii has also levied a discriminating duty on
Japanese mine Imports. That was another vio?
lation of the treaty. Hawaii would certainIy
act in the matter of our claim If the United
States would use her good offices."

ave., th* city home of lames Gordon Bennett, on
Saturday night, and plundered it of considerable
property. What the burglars actually got away
With Is not definitely known. It will need more

formed the police. Detective!. Wilbur and Shermer
were sent to investigate. They went to the stable
and searched. In one corner of It ;hey found a lot
of rugs, some carpets and a piece of harness.
They were piled up on a trunk, which the de?
tectives opened, to find that It contained a quantity
of bronzes and choice brlc-ft-brac. One of the
articles was a valuable brome clock, which was
still going. After a genera! examination of the
property the detectives secreted themselves and
watched. It wa? 2 30 o'clock when the door of the
stable was pushed open, and two men sneaked In.
Before they had taken two steps the detectives
pounced on theni and made them prisoners. D??
te.Uve Wilbur took the men to the station, while
?w' mer remained to watch the property. Themen

CONGRESS STARTS IN TO-DAY
NOT MUCH LIKELY TO BE ACCOMPLISHES)
THIS WEEK.
THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE EXPECTED TO-DAY
WORK CUT OUT FOR THE COMMITTEES?
MICH INTEREST IS THE QUESTION
OF- ANNEXING HAWAII.
Washington. Dec. 5.?The long session of Con?
gress. as It is called, because there Is no con?
stitutional limitation on the period of Its dura?
tion, opens at noon tD-morrow. The leaders and
a large majority of the members of both houses
are here to participate in the opening cere?
monies, and President McKinley has made the
Journey from the bedside o* his dying mother
that his absence might not delay the National
legislature at its assembling.
The extra session robs the opening of the regu?
lar session of the excitement and Interest which
usually attach to it. On the eve of a regular
session ordinarily Washington thrills with ex?
citement. The hotel lobbies surge with place
hunters in the wake of the various candidates
for Speaker, clerk, doorkeeper, etc; the members
are struggling for committee assignments, and
the air is full of rumor? of plots and counter?
plots. But as the House was completely or?
ganized at the extra session and all the com?
mittee assignments were made then, beyond the
natural stimulus produced b> the returning
statesmen, the regular hangers-on of legislation
and the outlining of schemes by members of the
"third house," or lobby, Washington to-night la
tranquil.
The programme at the House to-morrow Is
very simple, and beyond the spectacular show
which It effers to the curious has in itself little
attraction. ' The Hous? will be called to order
by the Speaker, who. afier the chaplain's invo?
cation, will order the clerk to call the roll. Thl?
1-i;l\ !??? been accomplished nnd the presence of
a quorum demonstrated, the clerk will be dl
' reded to notify the Senate that the House
Is ready for business, and a committee will be
' appointed to wait on the President. After this
; there will be a recess to.await the arrival of the
! President's annual Message, which will be reed
! upon Its reception, and be followed by an ad
1 J.-urnment until Tuesday. This Is the regular
routine, and. unless something unforeseen oc
? curs, will not be departed from.
RAPID WORK LXPKCTED IN THE HOUSE
It la the Intention of the House leaders to pro?
ceed with the business of the session as rapidly
as possible The committees will all begin their
labors this week, and as all if them have bills
on hand which were Introduced at the extra ses?
sion, there will be no lack of material for the
House to work on after the committee-hoppers
have begun to grind. The Appropriations Com?
mittee has been at work for ten days, and Chair?
man Cannon expects to pass at least two of the
regular budgets?the Legislative, Executive and
Judicial and the Pension appropriation bills -
before the holidays. One or the other of thes?
bills, it Is expected, will be reported by Wednes?
day, and the end of the week promisee to see
? the House down to business.
Among the early general measures to receive
consideration will be the Bankruptcy bill.
Whether it will he the Nelson bill, which passed
the Senate at the last session, or a modification
of the Torrey bill, depends on the temper of the
1 Judiciary Committee, which will submit the
measure ?o the House. Beyond doubt there will
be several resolutions of inquiry during the first
week, which may be more or less sensational,
and some of the radical pro-Cuba members will
attempt to get consideration for a Cuban reso?
lution before the Foreign Affairs Committee can
act. Congressman Livingston, of Georgia, Is on?
of these. But, owing to the nature of the House
rii!-s. all these hasty efforts will prove abortive,
and they probably will take their regular course.
There ?ill be nothing except Indisposition on
the part of members to prevent the Senate en?
tering promptly on Its work upon convening
to-morrow, as there is a calendar ready made
for It, with about three hundr-d bills reported
from committees otirlng the special session. If
any circumstance should prevent the receipt of
the President's Message to-morrow the proba?
bilities are that the Senate would adjourn over
without takir.g up any other business until the
Message could be received.
HAWAII TO HK CONSIDERED EARLY.
With the Message read, it will remain for
the Senate to decide whether It shall enter seri
otts'.y upon the work of the session after Mon?
day, or begin a system of delay Intended to
throw all important questions over beyond th?
| Christmas holidays. The Indications are now
for a little more activity than usual during the
pre-hollday session. This Is largely due to the
fact that the supporters of the Administration
and other advocates of annexation are very
! anxious to secure the earliest possible considera?
tion of the treaty with Hawaii. Senator Davis,
[ chairman of the Oomm'.'tee on Foreign Rela
j tlons. announces his purpose of pressing annexa?
tion at the earliest possible moment, but It Is
probable that the matter will not be taken up
I seriously until the committee can have a meet?
ing and decide on details of procedure. The
committee will be called together on Wednes?
day for this purpose.
One point which the committee will be called
on to decide Is whether to proceed to ratify the
treaty of annexation or to annex the Islands by
resolution. The annexatlonlsts have lost som?
votes during the vacation, and there Is now ap?
prehension that the two-thirds vote necessary to
assure the ratification cannot be secured. No
satisfactory canvass Is possible until all the Sen?
ators arrive, and If It is then made manifest
that the necessary two-thirds vote cannot be
secured ft Is likely that the proceeding by mean?
Of resolution, which would require only a ma?
jority vote, will be Inaugurated. Some members
of the Foreign Relations Committee who favor
annexation advocate this course, because they
1 say they see no reason for traversing the same
j ground twice, as they would be compelled to do
' in case the matter should be first considered In
' executive session, fall there and then be taken
! up in the form of a resolution In open Senate
and House.
1MMIC.RATION AND OTHER BILLS.
The Immigration bill, for which Senator Lodge
stands sponsor. Is practically at the head of the
I Senate legislative calendar and will be consld
| ered early In the session. Senator Lodge to-day
repeated his intention of pressing the bill, but
he will not antagonize the Hawaiian treaty
with It.
The first bill on the calendar Is Senator Gear'?
1 measure providing for the adjustment of the
I Pacific Ral'.rcad debt, but the sale of the Union
j Pacific doubtless will have the effect of causing
the temporary withdrawal of this bill and the
! substitution of others.
Of the three hundred bills on the estender
l about two hundred are private pension bills, and
i all of these probably will be disposed of at one
sitting when taken up. There are also several
hundred recess appointment? to be considered In
executive session.
It Is not probable that much will be done la
the way of legislation during the present week.
There will be an adjournment for the day after
receiving the Message on Mondsy, and, as there
is no disposition to press the Hawaiian matter
until the Foreign Relations Committee agreea on
a Une of action, the Indications now are that
It will not be taken up in the Senate before
next week. ?
