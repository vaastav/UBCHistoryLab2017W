PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Stronger Trust Laws and Tax on
Incomes Suggested
Raps the Catlfornlani for Their Treat
ment of the Japanese and Says We
May Assume Control In Cuba.
President Roosevelt In his mcssago to
Congress Tuesday Indicates very clearly
that not only will there be no backward
step on any of tho great policies Initiated
by his administration, but rather thoro
will bo advanced along tho whole lino.
Ho announces his determination) to
forco tho railroads and other great com
binations to obey tho law and states that
It Is his definite and settled policy to re
sort to criminal proceeding to this end.
In order that his hands may be strength
cned In this matter ho asks Congress for
a law giving the government the right of
appeal In criminal cases. Ho shows that
railroads, far from being Injured by tho
rate law, nover have been more prosper
ous. In fact, ho says that of all tho laws
passed by tho last Congress securing to
the government a proper supervision and
control over corporations doing Interstate
business have Justified their enactment.
But ho does not intend to stop here. Ho
urges such an extension of tho powers
of tho Interstate commerce commission
as will enable It effectively to deal with
the evils still existing. As! a further
mcasuro of control over tho great cor
porations and to prevent tho securing of
inordinate profits by favored Individuals
at tho expense of uio general public,
stockholders or wage-workers, a national
license Is suggested. It Is pointed out
that this la not a step toward state own
ership, but Is meant to head off tho So
cialistic and reactionary propaganda to
that end.
Continuing his efforts to ploco tho meat
Industry on a proper basis ho proposes
that canned goods bo marked with tho
date of preparation. A graduated tax on
Inheritances and Incomes la suggested.
tho fori er to bo heavier according to
the remoteness of tho Kin benefitted.
In regard to tho Incomo tax which was
declared unconstitutional by the Supremo
Court of the United States ho says that
as this decision Was by a bare- majority of
ono it might properly bo tested again. In
tlus connection and probably in answer
to criticism made of his criticism of a
court decision the President says that
Just and temperate criticism of Judicial
decisions; is not only permissible but
should be made.
An eight-hour law for railroad employes
Is urged as an opening wedge for a gen
ernl eight-hour day for all branches of
Industry that can be so handled. Drastic
laws, covering tho employment of women
and children, are advocated for tho Dis
trict of Columbia and all territories under
control of Congress and tho hopo Is ex
pressed that the states will get together
and legislate along the same line,
For the purpose of aiding In the settle
ment of disputes between capital and la
bor tho President thinks that a law pro
viding for tho compulsory Investigation
of the differences would tend to an ami
cable solution of any trouble and prevent
strikes. The President says tho public
has rights which both sides should bo
forced to consider. "Organized patriot-
Ism" tho substitution of national feeling
for mere local pride Is strongly advocated
Sections, classes and races should work
together for tho whole. The result would
bo Irresistible national efficiency.
Tho President comes out Btrongly
against lynch law and especially whero It
provokes raco antagonisms. Swift pun
ishment by law should take the placo of
mob rule. Death should be tho penalty
for rape, the crime which most often leads
to lynching. Along this line tho President
depreciates the withholding of education
from the negro, holding that brutality Is
a legacy of ignorance. The Hemngogucs
who preach discontent and class hatreds
receive a stinging1 rebuke. Mob triumph.
he says, would bo as dangerous as the
triumph of plutocracy
On International relations tho President
says that absolute selfishness should not
dictate our policy. It should be our er
fort to raise the ethical standard of our
dealing with tho world. Along this line
tho President draws attention to the high
motives back of tho Pan-American Con
press at Rio Janeiro, and tho settlement
of Central American differences without
war. The collection of debts from weak
nations by tho armed forces of great
Powers Is deprecated. The United States
will not do It and the President hopes
mat European nations will bo brought to
take tho sarao view.
It "Is a wicked absurdity." says the
President, for San Francisco to shut the
Japanese out of her common schools and
any failure of Americans to treat the
Japanese hero with the consideration that
our citizens receive In Japan Is "a confes
sion of inferiority In our civilization.'
Ho appeals to Congress for a law bpo
clflcally providing for the naturalization
of Japanese and also for such civil and
criminal statutes as will enable the gov
ernment to protect aliens In the rights
secured to them under treaties which are
the law of the land.
In relation to Cuba he says that new
elections will be held and tho provisional
government withdrawn, the United States
wishing nothing but tho "moral and ma
terial prosperity of tho island." But if
the elections oro a farce and Insurrections
become a habit, the United States will
assume control and fulfil Its obligations
to Cuba and the world.
A great navy Is not asked for. but Con
gress Is urged to maintain at least Its
present strength, replacing at once all
out-of-date ships by modern ones. Among
other things he says that the unprec
edented prosperity which wo enjoy
can only be marred by reckless spec
ulation and Illegitimate business meth
ods; suggsets a constitutional amend
ment regulating marriage and divorce:
advocates ship subsidy, currency reform
along tho lines proposed by the recent
congress of bankers; a lower tariff or free
trade with tho Philippines; American cit
izenship for the Porto Rlcans; completo
reorganization of the. government of Alas
ka; advises states to further technical and
Industrial education and promises gov
ernment aid In the teaching of scientific
methods of agriculture to farmers; re
news his plea for the preservation of the
forests; shows tho inadequacy of tho seal
ing regulations and hints that If negoti
ations with Japan and Great Britain for
tho protection of the herds fall Congress
must consider the proposition to exter
minate tho animals; urges tho defeat of
the proposed anti-Injunction law, but ad
vocates measures to prevent abuses of
the existing law; recommends a law pro.
hlbltlng political contributions by corpo
rations; announces the withdrawal of the
coal lands from settlement No mention
is made or larirt revision or the disband
ment of the negro troops. A special mes-
sage is promised on me 1'anama canal.

The New Flag with Oklahoma's Star.
The war and navy departments have
agreed upoon tho arrangement of the
stars In the Union .of the national flag, so
as to provide an additional star to repre
sent tho new state or Oklahoma. Tne
new arrangement will go Into effect on
July 4, 1907, and Is as follows:
This decision Is the result of a discus
sion of tho question of a change In the
arrangement of the stars, with a view to
subsequent audition of two stars, In
which event there will be six rows of
eight stars each In regular columns. The
war and nnvy departments received nu
merous suggestions, some of them coming
from school children In various parts of
tho country, and others from patriotic so
cieties, anxious to bo the author of a new
field. It was decided that It would be
better to adhere to Uio simple form, which
did not offer any geometrical violence to
the traditional arrangement of stars In the
flag, with which the people had become
acquainted, and which has prevailed the
last 90 years.
