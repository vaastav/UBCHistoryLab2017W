ASQUITH RESIGNS
CABINET FALLS
Political Crises in Britain Cli
maxes with Premier's Giv
ing Up Power.
BONAlt LAW SUMMONED.
King OIVitm I hp Prime Minister-it Colli'
mission In Unionist Lender De
cision Not Announced.
London, Dec. C. Tho government
crista found a Holutlon to-night which
up to tho hour of Its announcement
was considered tho least probable of
practical alternatives. Hcrbort II. As
tjulth resigned tho promlorshlp, which
he haB held throuch eight stormy years
of doraostlo and foreign history. Tho
unionist leadtr, Andrew IJonar Law,
was summoned to tho palace Immo.
dlately after Mr. Asquith had departed
and the King offered him tho prime
minister s commission, which ho had
Just accepted from Mr. Asqulth's
hands.
Iso announcement regarding Mr.
Bonar Law's decision has yet been
made, anil there nro some doubts
whether ho will accept the heavy re
sponsibility. If he declines. It Is con
sidered certain that the honor will fall
to David Lloyd-George. Tho continua
tion of tho coalition cablnot, with some
changes lu Its membership, and tho
speeding; up of tho war management
will bo tho policy In either event.
Tho premier's decision to resign and
itdviso the King to summon Andrew
Hunnr Law to form a cabinet was taken
after a day of extraordinary political ex
citement and activity. There were con
Mant comings and goings of tho political
leaders between Downing street nnd tho
various government departments. Mr.
Asitilth met several unionist leader In
consultation, Including Karl Curzon, Lord
ltobcrl Cecil and the Karl of Derby.
Nntlccablo absentees from this confer
ence werj- A. J. Halfour, who Is 111, An
drew Uoiinr Law, J. Austen Chamberlain
and Walter Hume Long.
Later In tho afternoon the premier met
his supporters, including Viscount Grey.
.Lewis llarcourt, Edwin S. Montagu, the
Marquis of Crewe, Iteglunlel Me-Kennn,
Walter Itunclman, Lord Huckmastor,
Herbert Samuel, Lord Heading and Ar
thur Henderson. The meeting lasted for
more than an hour and It Is supposed that
Mr Asqulth explained that ho wns faced
by almost hiMipeiable obstacles to the
leeonclllatlon of the contliotlng interests
and Intended to tender his resignation.
Almost Immediateiv the premier drove to
tins palaco and had an audience with the
King.
It Is now lemarked that when .Mr. As
quith was asked In the House of Com
mons yesterday If a food dictator had
been appointed, he replied sharply; "1
don t like a food dictator."
Theic Is much talk to-night of tho pos
Mollltlcs of a general election. Mr. Honar
Law would llrst form a cabinet, if he
takes office, an it is necessary that the
government bo carried on, and then ap
peal to the. electors for a ratlllcatlon of
his administration.
There is strong opposition, however, to
ny political campaign, which must nec
essarily divert tho country's energies
from tho war woik while It lasted, and
tho new government may decide to
go ahead, with tho approval of the
House of Commons only, and not of the
voters.
The part David Lloyd-Ceorgo is play
ing in the crisis was demonstrated
plainly to-dny by the fact that ho re
mained in his cilice while the premier
conferred separately with the liberal and
conservative members of the cabinet.
Mr Lloyd-George's policy had support
ers In both camps. His strongest liberal
friend. Lord Heading, carried messages
between the premier's councils and Mr.
Lloyd-George's desk.
It was significant to onlookers, also,
that Mr. Honor Law refrained from at
tending the conservatives' meeting with
Mr Asqulth and Loid Curzon hastened
to report to him at tho colonial ofllcn Im
mediately tho conference was ended.
Mr Asqulth's retirement has taken the
politicians so by surprise that they ore
not yet ready to predict the results. Tho
possibility that Mr. Asqulth will consent
to remain In the cabinet with Mr. Honar
Law, taking the pc.it of lord high chan
cellor. In which It has long been consid
ered ho might find a congenial berth, is
discussed.
Herbert Samuel's promotion from the
home secretaryship to Reginald McICen
na's position at tho treasury is also pre
dicted, while acceptance of the resigna
tions of Viscount Grey and A. J. Hal
fpur, which some of the papers backing
Mr. Lloyd-George are demanding. Is less
likely under Mr. Honor Law's regime
than if Mr. Lloyd-George came Into
power.
The labor party certainly will hold a
more important part in any new cabinet
than it has been filling in the old.
The more sensational London papers
have fnjoyed three or lour days of
almost frenzied excitement, with demands
nnii uenunciniions, oiien in innwiKo
i,t ranger than the dignity of Hritlsh poli
tics has permitted in the memory of the
present generation. The crucial events
in Koun.anlo and Greece have been given
u secondary place, except as they were
used as a basis for attacks on the min
isters "The strong man wins." was the poster
of the last edition of the Evening News,
which Is Mr Lloyd-George's organ, anil
"Asqulth stands firm," was the placard
of the Liberal Star.
Herbert Henry Asquith beeamo t lie pre
mier of Great Iirltaln in 1f"c. succeed
ing Sir Henry Camphell-Hannerman.
Mr. Asqulth at once began a policy of
reform parliamentary, social and consti
tutional-of a rndlc.il nature, aided by I
David Lloyd-George, with whom to-day ,
he appaiently is at odds. i
Shortly after tho outbreak of the war '
the liberal cabinet of Asqulth began to .
bo assailed by ittt political enemies, main-1
ly on tho conduct of tho war, and par- 1
tlcularly with regard to tho naval branch
of the British forces. So bitter was this
campaign that on May H'l, 1915, a coalition
cabinet was formed, with Asquith, how
ever, retaining tho portfolio of prime
minister.
The present political crisis In Great
Britain apparently had Its origin In a
fdmllnr situation, especially on account of
tho government's postponement of con
Hlder.atlon of the Hritlsh air boatd's de
mand for fuller powers to meet tho situa
tion created by German air raids on Eng
land, the recent change In the command
of the Hritlsh lleet by which Vleo Adml-
ral SlrDavId Ileatty was made head of
the grand fleet and especially Mr. Lloyd
George's demand for a smaller war coun
cil, which should have powers to act In
dependently of tho cabinet.
CMr. Asqulth In Parliament Monday ad
mitted that there was trouble in Ills cab
inet and that ho had asked King Cleorgo
to permit a reconstruction of It. Just how
It was proposed to change tho ministry
was not stated, but tho prlmo minister
said that ho desired to make It perfectly
plain that whatever method of iccon
Htructlon was effected It would Involvo no
departure from tho policy already an
nounced nnd pursued by the government
'jlnco tho beginning of tho war.

viewing lecommendiitlons for railroad!
legislation, a corrupt practices act, nnd 1
had pnssed to his reColnlnpllllntlnnH fntl
a broader government for Porto Itlco. '
lie was just about to begin n sentence. I
"The present liiws ir..rnln.- ti, 1

prlvilegt of Its people are not just." I
when ovei the rail of the gallery, where'
sat a party of women suffrage leaders, j
there fluttered down nlmvn !,..
of an amazed assemblage of senators I
and representatives a silken banner of i
suffrage yellow, bearing lu great black,
letters tne, inscription-
President Wilson, wh.n will vm, .in I
for woman suffrage?"
The Miffrnclsts sold nfi.. (w'nn) It ii'ne
their protest atr.-ilnst tin. irnsi.innu I
plea with Congress for broader suffrage
ior tne men of I'orto Hlco while he did,
not mention their own i-.nix,. 1.,
uress.
As the banner rippled down, the'
suftragists sat smiling nnd unpciturhed i
watching the effect.
Tlill PHKSIUn.VT SMlLi;s.
A diminutive page, raised rji the arms
of nun directly under tho gallery,
grasped the edge of Hie banner aiiii
snatched it down. President Wilson, at
tracted hy the stir, looked up from his
reading, and apparently taking In tho
situation at a glance, smiled .broadly and
without hesitation or interruption turned
his eyes back to the manuscript and con
tinued his address to Its end without
further dcmnnstratieji.
Policemen and gallery guanls scurried
to where the women were seated, but
contented themselves with watching the
party, as If to prevent a further outbreak.
When the joint session was over tho
suffragists filed out unmolested by tho
police, who said they hod no ordeis other
than to prevent any further Infringement
c.f the rules of the House. The banner
remained n trophy with the scrgeont-at-nrma.
WOMAN'S PbANS CAHEFULLA" LAID,
As It turned out, tho women hod their
plans laid with precision and lot loose
tho banner almost on thu second. Evi
dently In possession of on advance copy
of tho President's address they had timed
tho document at the speed they expected
he would read, and anticipated ho would
reach the Porto Hlco section In ctL'ht min
utes. Miss Mabel Vernon of N'evada, who
heckled tho President hero at his Ameri
can Federation of Labor speech last
July, and who smuggled tho banner Into
tho House gallery under hor coat to
day, kept tlnio und guvn tho signal for
the unfurling of the banner.
Hoforo tho pollco could get to tho gnl-
ler the suffragists' press agent was
busy handing out printed leports of tho
affair replete lu detail, giving tho names
of the militants and Interviews with
each.
Tho consensus of their opinion was
summed up by Mrs. Abby Scott Haker of
tho Congressional Union who declared
the Incident was expressive of the Indig
nation that women feel nt the opposition
to granting the right of self-government
to one-half the people of the United
States,
TEN" ACCLAIMED HEROINES.
The i women who partlclnated In the
demo:. i: ,on marched off, ucelalmed

quarters, where they held a reception. 1

of Maryland conmosed the suffi agists'
partj. The ft"" ' e held tho banner and
th latter fi i 1 as guards, prepared
to resist i . i 'o. The women had
carried on i , . oiiorations so carefully,
however, that none of tho hundreds of
spectators surrounding them hnd any Ink
ling of their plans.
MOltE 8TAKTL1NG NEXT TIME. 1
The demonstration, sav the suffragists. I
worked well enough to suit them even it
it failed to draw any acknowledgment and '
they plan something moro startling the '
next time. Everybody around tho con
gressional union who had anything to do ,
with It was keen for another.
Miss Lucy Hums declared the suffrage '
ipicstlon was the only one befoie Con- ,
press to-day when President Wllron fin
ish reading ills address. I
"When he finished," said she. "tho sen- !
ators and representatives on tho f.oor
turned townrd us and muttered ono word
'Suffragists:' No one said 'Adamson law'
or 'Porto Tlleo.' We feel that wo did our
duty to-day and wo never should have
forgiven ourselves hnd we overlooked it." ,
WHITE HOUSE NOT RESPONSIBLE.
"Has tho White Hoiisu Issued any!
statement about it?" was the query of,
'.lie Miff racists' leaders. i
Up to a lato hour to-night, however, I
tlu White House had not and there were
no Indication." whether or not thu Presl- '
dent was much put out. j
Aside from the surtrago Incident the
demonstra'ion of welcome which greeted
the President was thu feature of the joint)
session. Many lepuhlleans Jolnol in np-I
dause and cheering which was led on 1
the Poor by Wllli.mi .1. Bryan and some
of the cabinet members It wns said to
