TOPEKA STATE JOURNAL WEDNESDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 15, 1897.
GREED OF OFFICE.
Grosvenor and His
Following;
Seize Every Opportunity
To Push the Fight Against the
Civil Service.
SHORT SESSIONS HELD.
Both Houses of Congress Ad
journed Early
Ont of Respect to President Mc
Kinley and His Bereavemeut.
Washington, Dec. 15. The house yes
terday at a session of about two hours,
adjourned out of sympathy for the
president, whose mother was burled at
Canton in the afternoon. The time of
the session was devoted to the consid
eration of the legislative, executive and
the Judicial appropriation bill. It was
decided to postpone consideration of
the item providing: for the maintenance
of the civil service commission until
after the other features of the bill had
been concluded. It was apparent from
the remarks made that the entire sub
ject will !m? exhaustively debated. There
is seemingly no disposition to curtail
the discussion and it probably will not
lie concluded before the holiday recess.
So absorbing i sthe topic that almost
the entire time, despite the fact that
the consideration of the question had
been technically postponed, was con
sumed in the debate upon it.
Mr. Orosvenor (Rep., O.) under whose
direction the tight on the civil service
law is being made, expressed the opin
ion that the bill should not be pressed
to a final vote until after the holidays.
Mr. Barrett (Hep., Mass.) took the
floor and made some general remarks
in support of the civil service law. In
the course of which he referred to the
Blender minority against the civil ser
vice law when it passed the house in
1SS3.
Mr. Cannon, (111.) and Bingham. (Pa.)
reiterated their opposition to the broad
extension of the law by executive or
ders. The latter explained that the law
was passed under suspension of the
rules, practically without debate, and
never contemplated an extension by ex
ecutive orders that would cover 87,000
government employes.
Mr. Barrett, continuing insisted that
It was a Republican measure, passed
by Republican votes and that the party
was irrevocably committed to the pol
icy of civil service reform.
Mr. Moody (Rep.. Mass.) said he was
willing to give a hearing on the civil
service question and he did not propose
to give a Judgment in advance.
Mr. Grosvenor commended this state
ment. Ail he asked was that the house
ehould honestly consider the question
and give its careful judgment. "The
statesmanship that does not do Its own
thinking." he said, "the statesmanship
that only respects what others say is
the statesmanship the parrot displays
In the course of his morning ablutions."
(Laughter).
Mr. Dockery (Dem., Mo.) discussed
the immense growth of the expenditure
of the government during the recent
years. The ordinary expenses of the
government, exclusive of the public
iebt, during the last eight years ex
ceeded the figures of the preceedlng
eight years by tl,0"0,000 in round num
bers. In view of this fact there were
only two ways, he said, to bring the
receipts and expenses together. Either
taxation must be increased or expenses
curtailed. If the expenses were to be
reduced congress alone could not ac
complish much without the aid of the
executive branch of the government.
Despite the president's appeal in his
message for economy, the executive
branches of the government had sub
mitted to congress estimates for appro
priations of $27,000,000 in excess of the
appropriations for the current year.
At this point the committee rose and
Mr. Grosvenor, (Rep., Ohio) addressing
the chair, said: "Mr. Speaker, as is
well known the funeral exercises of the
mother of the chief magistrate of the
nation are to take place at this hour
and therefore, conforming to the action
of the senate as a token of our sympa
thy and respect for the president, I move
that the house do now adjourn."
The motion was unanimously carried.
THE SENATE.
Was in Session Just Long Enough
for Senator Kyle to Offer a BilL
Washington, Dec. 15. The senate was
In session just 15 minutes yesterday, ad
journment being taken out of respect
to President McKinley. who was in at
tendance upon the funeral of his moth
er. The motion to adjourn was made by
Mr. Hoar of Massachusetts. "All sen
ators," said he, "are aware of the great
calamity that has overtaken the chief
magistrate of the nation. He is today
in attendance upon the funeral of his
mother. Out of respect to him, and as
an expression of sympathy for him in
his affliction, I move that the senate do
now adjourn."
No business beyond the Introduction
of bills and resolutions was transact
ed. Among the bills introduced was one
by Mr. Kyle of South Dakota.to change
the immigration laws of the United
States. He gave notice that at the
I'roper time he would offer the bill as a
substitute for that which, is now pend
ing before the senate.
"In only one feature." said Mr. Kyle,
"does my bill differ materially from the
measure now before the senate. My
bill provides that all immigrants shall
have their test of education made by
the United States consuls at the points
nearest to their homes. It is a serious
hardship for these, people to cross the
ocean with the prospect staring them
in the face of failing in the test at the
port of a foreign country. This feeling
of stage fright doubtless so seriously
affects many of them that they are un
able to do themselves justice in read
Jng the prescribed regulations of the
constitution of the United States. The
measure I have offered is to remedy
-what I regard as a defect in the meas
ure now under consideration in the
senate."
The senate then adjourned.
GAGE BILL, ALMOST BEADS.
The Secretary Will Submit Hia Cur
rency Measure Tomorrow.
Washington, Dec. 15. The determina
tion of Secretary Gage to appear on
Thursday and submit one general fin
ancial bill instead of a number of sep
arate bills has brought out many ex
pressions of satisfaction. It had the
effect of clearing up a situation which
was becoming strained, and gave prom
ise of an early report to congress on
financial bills.
The understanding was reached as a
result of a visit to the oapitol of the so
licitor of the treasury, Mr. Connell, rep
resenting Mr. Gage. He talked with a
Rutuber of Republican leaders, and it is
understood was advised by Mr. Dingley
and others that it would be desirable to
embrace financial subjects in one gen
eral bill.
Later the solicitor met Chairman
Walker and other members of the com
mittee on banking and currency and a
general conference was held as to what
should be done. It was made known
that Mr. Gage preferred to let the sub
ject go over until after the holiday re
cess. The committee urged, however.
that it desired to take the Gage bill,
and also" that" submitted by the mone
tary conference, under consideration
during the holidays, in order to be in a
position to report progress when the
house convened after the recess. It
was decided therefore that Mr. Gage
should submit his measure on Thursday
and appear in person to explain and
argue its merits and answer questions
from the committee. It was also made
clear that the secretary would cover
all his proposals in one general bill in
stead of cutting the subject up.
Having accomplished this much, the
members of the committee canvassed
the course they would take as to mak
ing an immediate report to the house
on the currency questions. It was de
cided that the first thing to be done
was to report a bill embodying the
three features recommended by the
president viz: A reduction of the tax on
circulation to one-half of one ner cent
the increase of circulating notes up to
the par value of bonds deposited, and
the establishment of small banks in
rural communities.
While these will be embodied in the
Gage plan, yet as they were especially
advised in the president's message, it
was felt to be advisable to give the
house the opportunity of acting on
them at once, without waiting for the
report on the Gage bill. For these
reasons, the full committee will be
asked to report on the president's pdan
at once. The draft of a bill has been
prepared by Mr. Brosius of Pennsylva
nia, and this was given to the solicitor
of the treasury, who is to return it in
time for action by the committee with
such suggestions as the treasurv au
thorities may wish to make. As to
the comprehensive Gae bill, this and
the monetary conference bill will be
gone over with care durine- the holi
days, and, as a result of the better
reeling created, members of the hank
ing and currency, committee say there
is no further doubt that action will be
reported to the house soon after the
nonaays.
DEMOCRATS UNITED.
Hold a Caucus and Outline the Party
Policy in Congress.
Washington, Dec. 15. The caucus of
the Democratic members of the house
of representatives last night resulted in
the adoption of resolutions denning
the party policy on the questions of
Cuba, finance and bankruptcy.
The caucus was largely attended, 101
of the 125 Democratic members being
present despite the stormy weather.
Representative Richardson of Tennes
see acted as chairman and Representa
tive Cummings of New York and Rep
resentative Cowherd of Missouri acted
as secretaries.
Representative Bailey tookthe initia
tive by presenting the following series
of resolutions:
Resolved, That it Is the sense of
this caucus that the Democratic mem
bers of the house of representatives
ought to resist all efforts, direct or in
direct, to retire . the greenbacks or
treasury notes.
Resolved. Second, that we are oppos
ed to and will resist all attempts to
extend the privileges of national banks,
or to reduce the taxes which they now
pay.
Resolved, Third, that we favor the
early consideration and passage of the
senate resolution recognizing that a
condition of war exists in the island of
Cuba between the government of Spain
and the Cuban people.
Resolved, Fourth, that we favor the
early enactment of a just and wise
bankruptcy law.
The first three features of the reso
lutions, on finance and Cuba, were con
sidered separately, the discussion be
ing vigorous and unanimously favora
ble. Mr. Bailey made the main speech,
urging that Democratic members
should take their position promptly
against those financial movements, now
assuming formidable dimensions, ow
ing to the recommendations given to
them by the president and secretary of
the treasury. He also spoke for a clear
cut position in favor of the recognition
of Cuba belligerency, aa embodied in
the Morgan resolution which passed
the senate during the extra session.
There was not a dissenting vote to
Mr. Bailey's propositions, and the first
three resolutions were carried by unan
imous vote, the result being received
with hearty cheers.
The fourth feature of the resolutions
declaring for a just and wise bankrupt
cy law, met with some opposition.
Mr. De Arraond of Missouri urged
that it was not expedient for the party
to take a position favorable to the
bankruptcy bill at this time. The res
olution was supported by Messrs. Bail
ey, Simms (Tenn.) and Sampson (Va.)
The resolution finally prevailed by a
large majority, although Mr. De Ar
mond and about a half dozen others
registered their votes tn opposition to
this course.
On motion of Mr. Maddox (Ga.) ar
rangements were made for the usual
congressional committee to conduct the
congressional campaign of 1S98.
The committee is to consist of one
member from each state, territory and
the District of Columbia, and nine sen
ators to be chosen by the senate Dem
ocratic caucus. .
The caucus adjourned at 9 o'clock,
having been in session just an hour,
and having accomplished its results
with practical unanimity.

"Charlie" Boyle Reaches Chicago
High Houses Astound Him.
Chicago, Dec. 15. On the register of the
Great Northern hotel is written:
"J. W. Boyle, Dawson City, N. W. T."
"Charlie Boyle, Fort Yukon, Alaska."
Charlie Boyle is an Indian, probably the
first of his race from his native haunts
to visit Chicago. His name really isn't
Boyle, but as J. W. Boyle, who is in
charge of him, says, 'I had to call him
something."
Charlie's home is any place near Car-
mack's post in the Klondike region. It
was Carmack who discovered the Bonan
za creek gold, so Charlie might have been
rich if he had had the advantages of a
college education and the whit man's
greed for gold.
The Indian spent most of yesterday
looking out of a window on the I floor
of the Great Northern hotel, counting the
stories in the Monadnock and Marquette
buildings. He counted the stories over
and over, and each time he reached the
figure 16 he was as delighted as a baby
with a new rattle.
'Sixteen houses high!" he said "sixteen
houses."
Again he marveled and called the atten
tion of Mr. Boyle to the big buildings.
Each story to him was a house, for
houses in his country have only one
story. i.
Although Charlie comes from the wild
northern country he could give many a
white man lessons in correct table man
ners. Probably this is due to the train
ing given him by Mr. Boyle. Anyhow,
he never puts his knife into his mouth.

Mr. Boyle has just come from Dawson
City. He is on his way home, at Wood
stock, Ont. He led a party out of Daw
son City September 24. He came via the
Dalton trail, the party being ice-bound al
together ten days. They left the Yukon
river with 12 horses, killing of! one after
the other before they reached the coast.
STRAIGHT FROM. DAWSON.
E. P. Ash Arrives and Says the Peo
ple Will be Starved Out by March.
"Washington, Dee. 15. Senator McBride
of Oregon has received the following from
E. P. Ash, who arrived at Portland on
November 30, direct from Dawson: "I
know that the supply of provisions in
Dawson cannot last longer than the mid
dle of March. No supplies can reach the
interior by ordinary conveyance until
next June, and I believe it will require
the resources of the United States govern
ment to equip an expedition strong enough
to overcome the obstacles of a mid
winter journey. This expedition should
be authorized at once, as it will take from
forty to fifty days to reach Dawson from
Skaguay and Dyea. I am certain that
there will be intense suffering unless re
let is at once provided for."
CANNED GOODS COMBINE.
Object is to Keep Down Production
and Keep Up Prices.
Chicago, Dec. 15. A special meeting of
the association of western makers of
canned goods was held here today to de-
ise a plan for limiting the acreage of
production and to keep up prices. The
meeting was held behind closed doors. An
attempt was made to form an agreement
to maintain rates and to stop the cutting
which began at the close of the season
of the present year.
The Burlington's New Observation
Vestibuled Trains.
A very handsome set of wide obser
vation vestibuled trains are Just out of
the Burlington's shops. They are avail
able for all classes of travel, and are
the only trains of their kind to St.
Louis from the Missouri River. These
are the Denver, Missouri River and Su
Louis limited trains. Every car has a
wide observation vestibule. The trains
are lighted throughout with PIntsch
gas and equipped also with standard
and compartment sleepers.
These trains are a duplicate of the
new "Eli" to Chicago.
This achievement reflects the high
est credit upon the Burlington man
agement in Missouri, which is the first
to introduce into the service, from the
west to St. Louis, these solid, complete,
wide-vestibuled trains for all classes of
travel.

VACCINATED HIS BRIDE.
Then She Jilted Him Col. Cavaleri
to Sue Atlanta for Damages.
Atlanta, Ga., Dec. 15. One of the most
peculiar damage suits on record will be
the outcome of the virus war now In
progress in this city. A force of city
physicians and policemen are visiting
every home, office, shop' and store, vac
cinating by force when necessary, and one
of the unwilling victims was a young lady
of 16, who was soon to have become the
bride of Colonel E. E. Cavaleri, 74 years
old and a veteran of the Union army.
Cavaleri states he was engaged to the
young lady, and love's young dream was
not marred until the doctor came upon
the scene. In his vaccinating rounds he
met the young lady, who demurred to be
ing vaccinated because she said she was
going to get married.
The old gentleman says the doctor dis
suaded her from getting married, saying
that it would be better for her to get vac
cinated than married.
The girl finally consented to be vaccin
ated, and when the aged lover returned
to his promised bride he found a cool re
ception. She flatly refused to marry him,
giving as reason that the doctor had ad
vised her that vaccination was better than
marriage. All he could say availed noth
ing. She was obdurate and declined to
marry.
"I am the sufferer; the city is responsi
ble, and it must pay me damages, and a
good sum, toe," ha isaid-today.
Cavaleri served in'lhel CThlon army, and
now draws a pension: He is a venerable
looking man, with long white hair and
beard and refined, careworn face. He is
a man of education and has written an
autobiography.
ELOTHERIUM. FOR CHICAGO
Monster of a Past Age for the Field
Museum Collection.
Chicago. Dec. 15. An elotherium is on
the way to Chicago. So far as is known
he has no relatives living near Lake
Michigan and his immediate ancestors
are unknown to the oldest inhabitant.
Prof. C. O. Farrington of the Field Mu
seum, will introduce the stranger.
Professor Farrington has not yet been
able to fully trace the ancestry of the
hightoned elotherium, but he believes
that some of the blue blood of the ano
plotherium commune once flowed In his
veins. The learned geologist and biolo
gist thinks that such evidence ought to
be sufficient for an introduction to the
most exclusive circles among megather
iums, dinotheriums, mammoths and
mastodons who have their home in the
museum at Jackson park.
The exact location where Professor
Farrington found his new acquaintance
is not known in Chicago. It was some
where up in the Bad Lands, fifty miles
or so east of Rapid City, S. D. The
professor is on'a geological expedition
in the interest of the Field Columbian
museum, and it was on one of his jour
neys in that region of bad roads and
worse Indians that he came across the
freak.
Several specimens similar to the one
found by Professor Farrington have
been unearthed in New Mexico and Ar
izona, but if reports are true the last
find is the king pin of them all. Com
plete specimens of any of the prehistor
ic mammals and sea monsters are ex
tremely rare. Professor Farrington's
curiosity is the most complete specimen
found up to date.

PREACHERS OBJECT.
A Crusade in Lincoln, Neb , Against
Sunday Funerals.
Lincoln, Dec. 15. The ministers -of
Lincoln are up in arms against Sunday
funerals and the local association today
took action looking to their discourage
ment. Some person advocated a resolution
that they refuse to officiate, but this
was deemed too radical. Almost every
man in town belongs to a secret order,
and these have been holding bodies of
deceased members for from three to
five days in order to bury them with
signal honors and a big turnout. From
three to six funerals a Sunday broke
the preachers' patience and caused the
inauguration of the present crusade.

The National Board of Trade
In Annual Session.
Sees Cause for Alarm About the
Future.
FIAT MONEY CRAZE
The Inevitable Issue of the
Next Campaign, it Says,
Unless Unexpected Prosperity
Shall Prevail.
Washington, Dec. 15. The national
board of trade met here today for its
2Sth annual session, ex-Gov. Stanard
of Missouri presiding in the absence of
Frederick Franey of Pennsylvania
who has been president of the board
since 1868.
The executive committee made its
annual report, which was adopted
without a dissenting vote.
On the subject of the currency, the
report says:
"Probably there is no subject which
is still of so much importance as that
of the currency. While the great up
rising in favor of sound money in 1S98
was not without Its good effect, there is
still much to be desired in the way of a
permanent prosperity, which condition
is mainly due to the fact that the fu
ture of our monetary system is still
largely in doubt. Over confidence as to
the continued influence for good and
the defeat of silver at the last election
Is a serious mistake. While hard times
are undoubtedly a stimulus to
unsound systems of . finance, it
is a mistake to suppose that
the numerous friends of such systems
will be entirely satisfied by a return
of prosperity. Hard times which did
not originate the silver question, have
undoubtedly been used by interested
parties to instill false ideas into the
minds of many of our people, princi
pally workingmen and farmers, which
have become a part of their oolitical
belief. A spirit of unrest and dissatis
faction still exists among such classes
and there is no evidence that among
such, any great conversion from the
tree silver doctrine has taken place
anywhere in the country.
In New York or Nebraska the opin-
ions of the dissatisfied are now practi
cally the same as before the election.
The form may have changed. As free
silver was but a form and natural se
quence of the greenback heresy, so now
the tendency is to become a flat money
rather than a silver fallacy; but in
whatsoever form it shows itself, it has
become a general theory of public pol
icy and a conspicuous tenet in the doc
trine of a national political party. To
such the free silver or fiat money ques
tion and all considerations of currency
reform will be made subservient there
to. The only way to meet it is by per
sistent education, for which purpose
some of the sound money organizations
have been continued and a national one
formed, though without very much
popular interest or support, and by the
adoption of a sound financial policy,
Including not only coinage, but bank
ing and currency.
"W hile our present system exists,
there is the ever impending danger of
a repetition of our late financial dif
ficulties, when the country would be
at the mercy of those who do not have
its best interests at heart. In the ab
sence of careful attention in the mean
time, unless by some very unexpected
contingency we shall have an unprece
dented degree of national prosperity at
the time of the next general and presi
dential election, we may expect to see
the flat money issue the issue of the
campaign.
One of the most important reports
presented and adopted was that of
Jonathan A. Lane of Boston on the
reform of the consular service. The re
port adxocated the extension of the
civil service rules to cover consular
service to the end of securing practi
cal business men in the service rather
than purely political appointees. An
other recommendation was that here
after importers be compelled to attest
their invoices before a magistrate of
the country from which the goods are
shipped in addition to their oath be
fore the United States consul.
A report was adopted from the com
mittee on uniformity of state laws.
This especially looks to the unifying
of commercial laws in the various
states.
Somewhat in the same line is the ob
ject of the Torrey bill, which received
the indorsement of the meeting. This
measure relates to the unifying of land
laws of the several states.
The recommendation of Surgeon Gen
eral Wyman for a national quarantine
law was discussed at length rii3 hear
tily indorsed.
Mr. Speak of Boston submitted a re
port on the bankruptcy laws, stating
that a bill similar to the Torrey bill
would soon be introduced before the
house of representatives, and urging its
indorsement. This report was referred
to a special commission.
The venerable president of the board,
Frederick Franey, of Philadelphia, who
has held office ever since the organiza
tion of the board, was unanimously re
elected. Go Away for the Holidays.

THE GREAT HUXLEY.
What Huxley, the Great English
Scientist. Considered the Best
Start in Life.
The great English scientist, Huxley,
said the best start in life is a sound
stomach. Weak stomachs fail to digest
food properly because they lack the
proper quantity of digestive acids (lac
tic and hydrochloric) and peptogenic
products; the most sensible remedy in
all cases of indigestion, is to take after
each meal one or two of Stewart's Dys
pepsia Tablets because they supply in
a pleasant, harmless form all the ele
ments that weak stomachs lack.
The regular use of Stewart's Dyspep
sia Tablets will cure every form of
stomach trouble except cancer of the
stomach.
They increase flesh, insure pure blood,
strong nerves, a bright eye and clear
complexion, because all these result
only from wholesome food well digest
ed. Nearly all druggists sell Stewart's
Dyspepsia Tablets at 50 cents full

CAPTURED THE GANG.
Cowboys Who . Held TJp a Southern
Pacific Train are Taken.
Silver City, N. M., rec. 15. News has
just been received here that a special
Wells-Fargo officer, J. N. Thacker, as
sisted by a posse of deputy United
States marshal under Cipriano Baca,
have captured the entire sang of train
robbers who last Thursday held up the
Southern Pacific at Stein's Pass, Grant
county, in the fight incident to which
one of the robbers was killed.
At the time of the Stein Pass hold up
the posse, which had been anticipating
an attack, was.tongreg'ated at Bowie,
about 35 miles from Stein's Pass. The
trail of the robbers was immediately
taken, and the five remaining members
of the gang were surrounded in a cabin
at Cushy's ranch, about 25 miles this
side of the Mexican line In eastern Ari
zona. The robbers were taken completely by
surprise and surrendered without a
single shot being fired. Their names
have not yet been ascertained, but they
are cowboys who have been working in
the vicinity of the San Simon valley
and have no connection with the no
torious Black Jack gang of border bam
dits. They have been brought by the posse
to San Simon station and will be
brought to this place to await trial.
The penalty for train robbing in New
Mexico is death. When captured the

BISMARCK'S WHEEL CHAIR
He is Wheeled From Boom to Boom
and Joins the Family at Meals.
Berlin, Dec. 15. Prince Bismarck's
energetic nature has suffered the mar
tyrdom of confinement for weeks at a
stretch to one room, owing to his swol
len legs.
He is now the happy possessor of a
wheel chair, wherein he roves from
room to room, joining the family meals
in the sitting room.
Thus he was enabled to lunch with
Prince Henry. He is strictly dieted,
but retains an unimpaired appetite and
high spirits.
There is one good restaurant in To
peka, that's the Cremerie, 726 Kinsas
avenue, Scott & Scott.

Upheld Her.
New York, Dec. 15. A special to the
Herald from Stroudsburg, Pa., says:
"An interesting decision was made
by Judge Albright, who is holding a
special session of court here. Miss
Kdith Custard, a tall and animated
young lady of Smithfield, was called to
testify in a case. Among the first ques
tions asked by the lawyer was this:
" 'How old are you. Miss Custard?'
"The reply' was: 'I may be 30 for all
you know. My age has nothing to do
with the case and I refuse to tell you."
"Judge AUbright agreed with the
young woman."
