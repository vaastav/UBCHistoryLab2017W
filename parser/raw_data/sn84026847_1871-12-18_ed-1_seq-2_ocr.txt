MONDAY. DECEMBER 18. ??*>?
Richmond, Virginia, had nearly eight
inches of snow last Friday; the heaviest
snow fall that has occurred there for
many years.
The Intelligencer has a very astonish
ing facility for missing its mark every
time. It has failed in its attempt to
drive the Baltimore and Ohio railroad
shops away from the city and, in its
natural chagrin, assault? the editor of
the Register, hut only to blunder as
signally as before. The person aimed
at in the Iniclligcnccr paragraph of Sat
urday morning was absent from the
city during the greater part ot last week,
and the personal remark was therefore
misplaced, as it would have been under
any circumstances foolish and un
called for.
It was 6tated by a member of Couucil
last Thursday night, that he had been
told that the gentleman who delivered
what the Intelligcnecr styles, with ac
cidental truthfulness, an " ansxocralle "
argument against the release of the
railroad property from taxation, had
hired a reporter to make a verbatim
copy of his speech for publication. He
did not pay us for its insertion in the
Reoister and, as it was probably more
interesting and important to the gentle
man himself and to his hired reporter
than to any other person in the city, we
have not spread it in full before our
readers. We are, however, somewhat
surprised to see that the Intdligcnccr
has not yet published the speech ac
cording to contract, although the editor
has been " seen." Possibly our neigh
bor's direliction in this may be in con
sequence of the reporter's proving him
self unworthy of his hire.
REFI BLICAX REFOBJf.
The Grant party in the United
States Senate, acting probably under
private instructions from the White
Hou-e, has virtually resolved against
reform and in favor of fraud. The
wholesale plundering of office holders,
and the well attestel stories of bribery
in securing places of triwt and profit
under the government are to be hushed
up, and no investigation is to be per
mitted. Judge Trumbcll's attempt to
create an investigating committee caused
a wonderful disturbance la?t week
among the friends ot' the present sys
tern, and proiuce l a very hearty com
motion among those Senators whose
own hanls are not in condition for
close inspection. I hey have accord
ingly resolved to emasculate the
resolution by striking out ail that
relates to civil service reform, also
all that refers to the employment of
l>atronage to secure personal and polit
ical ends, and will render the committee
powerless by refusing it authority to
send for persons and papers. In addi
tion to this, the Republican caucus re
solves that the committee shall be com"
posed almost entirely of its enemies,
and, in violation of all parliamentary
precedent, the authors and friends of
the resolution are compelled to stand
back, while some of the very men
whose conduct it was proposed to in
vestigate are given places on the com
mittee. The committee is to cover up
rather than expose the frauds that have
heen committed; to whitewash the
thieves rather than arraign them for
punishment.
This course was resolved upon by
the caucus of Republican Senators last
Friday, and will probably be consum
mated in open Senate to-day,
Notwithstanding the promises in the
President's message, and all his simu
lated commendation of civil service re
form, the stealing is to go on unchecked
and unrebuked. Any attempt to bring
about a return to honesty is fitly char
acterized by the Republican party as
" an attack upon Grant's administra
tion, "and, as faithful henchmen, they
stand by their master, and deem it their
duty to shield him and his interests
from possible harm. This is the style
in which the Grant party enters upon
the Presidential campaign. It is the
defender and protector of thieves, and
the foe of honesty and of honest men.
Let the people accept the issue thus
tendered by the Bepublican members of
the United States Senate.

We call the attention of our citizens
who are interested in railroad building
to the letter from Akron, Ohio, wluch
wo publish this morning. If we want a
new road to Cleveland, and we believe
the advavtages of such a road enter
jargely into the calculations of the
I friends of the Lake Shore and Tusca*
rawas Valley project, the route referred
I to by Mr. Conger running through
j Akron and Canton and striking the
proposed Wheeling and Lake Erie road
, at Bowerstown or Zoar, would be shorter
and better in most respects than that by
way of the L. S. A* T. V. road. The
towns of Akron and Canton are them
selves of much importance, and direct
railroad communication with them
would be of no little advantage to
Wheeling, while a road to Cleveland
by that route would be not only shorter
than the present one, but shorter than
any other yet proposed. We think the
-uggestioc worthy of mature considera
tion, and believe that the friends of the
Wheeling and Lake Erie road may find
in this new proposition an auxiliary to
their plan.
It is understood in Washington that
the marriage of Secretary Robeson
to Mrs. Atlick, will take place very
soon. The wedding will be on a scale
of great magnificence.
Ball road to Cleveland.
The following letter in relation to a
new road to Cleveland by way of Akroo,
has been handed to us by the gentleman
to whom it was addressed :
Akron, 0., December 14th, 1871.
Mr. Boyd, Dear Sir ? I am request
ed by our "Railroad committee" to
write to you and ask you to say
to your citizens who are interest
ed in a railroad connection with
Cleveland, that Akron and Canton, to
gether with parties in Cleveland, jhave. a
railroad project through those pointsjto
Bowerstown, Harrison county, and would
be glad to co-operate with Wheeling
interests to extend the road to that
point
This project was first talked of as a
"narrow gauge," but this idea is now
abandoned, as capital enough can be se
cured to build a regular gauge, inde
pendent of any of the great corporations
which control our railroad interest*.
We will send a committee to your
city soon to consult with your people,
and would be glad if your folks would
hold off and not commit themselves to
any other project until they have heard
from us, believing that we can offer
vou greater inducements than any
other route.
This route would run from Cleveland
up the Cuyahoga Valley to Akron;
thence to Canton, and from Canton we
wish to make Wheeling. If you are
not personally interested in this matter,
please hand this to some one ot your
citizcns who is. Very truly yours,
A. L. Conger.
The W. Vh. Cent rHl Railrontf.
From the Preston County Herald.]
Last week we published the contract
for building the West Virginia Central
Railroad. This road is of more impor.
tance to West Virginia than any other
road in the State, and especially to the
citizens of Preston county, and we do
not understand why the Hon. James
C. McGrew, one of the Commissioners
from this county, absented himself from
the meeting oi the Board when the
contract was entered into and neglected
the interest of this section of the line in
not confining the undertakers to make
the road by Brandonville and King
wood as well as by Buckbannon, as was
contemplated by the original charter.
This being the most direct route, and
the amount of freight it will give to the
road, shosld be an inducement for the
undertakers to make the road on this
route.
If the road is tuade through Preston
county on the line of the original char
ter, it will not only take it the longest
way through the county, but through a
section of country that abounds in large
auantities ol coal, iron ore and timber,
and a section that has as fine natural
advantages for manfacturing purposes
as any country in the United States.
We, iu this section of the State, feel
the great necessity of a rival road to the
Baltimore and Ohio road. W hen that
road was located throjgh this country
the greater portion ot the landholders
here gave them the right of way
through their lands, and now for return
of their kindness the company is
charging them twice or thrice as much
for pa.-sige and freight on their road a^
they are charging citizens ofCincinnati,
Chicago and others west of the Ohio
river, who never save anything toward
their road. And, too, they are violating
the laws of our State every year, by
refusing to pay taxes on their property
to the counties through which the road
passes.
We hope that the citizens of West
Virginia will not be remiss in giving all
the aid they can in building the West
Virginia Central ralroad. This road,
when made, will be one of the greatest
thorough 'ares from tl e southwestern
portion of the Union to the eastern
cities.

A fikrlrh of the Lonely TrnnrM?r
Slembfr of thr ff?js no<l Menus
Committee.
From tlie New Yorlc Herald.]
Horace Maynard, who by relative
position of tlie committee would be its
chairman in case Mr. Dawes should
from any cause be incapacitated, is an
old member of the House, and
proWablyone of the moat stupid nieu in
it. He is fifty-seven years old, very
tall, very lithe and straight, with long,
lustreless black hair, no beard, a
sickly black eye, a sallowish, white
complexion, and the gait, coldness and
vindictiveness of an Indian. There
is a superstition abroad in the House
that Maynard possesses some of the
blood of the old Indian tribes of Massa
chusetts, where he was born, at West
boro, in 1814; early ia life he became
a temporary resident of South Carolina,
but received a certain sort of collegiate
education at Amherst College, Massa
chusets; thence he went out to gain a
living by teaching, and he found
occupation in East Tennessee among
the ignorant and peculiar mountaineers
of that region. For 6ix years he was a
tutor in what was called the University
of East Tennessee, and while there he
studied law. Being a persistent, quiet,
relentless man ia his aspirations, as
well as in his resentments, he succeeded
so well as to take a fair rank in that
unlettered community, and he filled
several local offices, became, in war
times, Attorney General of the State;
was twice a Presidential elector, and
has been seven times sent to Congress.
Maynard is peculiar among Congress
men. In the moral points of character,
strictly defined, he is unimpeachable.
He does not 6teal nor lie, nor break
any of the commandments outright ;
but in narrowness of charity, a
longevity of resentment, and incapacity
to look at any question in its broad
bearings, a certainty, to li* ufon some
small neighborly point and torture it
up by self-consideration and vanity, so
that it comes to embrace the whole
issue ? this is the sort of a person who
is adjudged, worthy to be named next
to Mr. Dawes on a committee which is
called upon to be the most philosophical
committee in Congress, to be least
sectional, disinterested, and to be capable
of embracing the whole United States
in the benignant and unselfish eminence
which it occupies. A volume might
be complied of all Maynard'e littleness
and pursuit of petty piques. Hie has
been good while on the committee of
Ways and Means, and the only person
with whom he could ever agree
altogether was Judge Kelly, who bore
towards his fellow committee men pretty
much like a relation. Mr. Allison, of
Iowa, was once asked about the inside
operations of that committee and he
replied :
Well, Horace Maynard would be
willing to put one thousand per cent,
on any article of import. He don't
care what the article is. In many
respects he if ignorant of the develop
ment of the arte and sciences, Imng off
there io the mountains of Tennessee,
bat merely because in early life he em-'
braced the notions of Henry Clay ; he
is prepared, down to the day of his
death, to vote a Japanese policy for
this country and make it utterly isola
ted and selfish.
-Some years ago Maynard had a con
troversy with Cullorn on some little
question which became quite animated.
The Globe newspaper at Washington,
under the accidental necessities of
prompt daily publication, had to give
Cullom more chance to correct speeches
in the controversy than it could to
Maynard. Maynard has never ceased
from that day to keep up this little
grudge, and perhaps of all the men in
Congress he is the truest type of a man
without a positive vice, and yet without
a negative virtue. Prompt in his at
tention upon committee, thrifty and
temperate, in all personal matters?ex
cept his resentments and his littlenesses
this man by temperament is least
acquainted with his age and time of
any person now in Congress. Blaine
gave him the pi ice he now occupies
because he thought that Maynard would
amount to nothing in it, and that alter
Dawes he would stand in the position of
a cipher, which, with ever so small a
digit before it, makes a number, and
without a digit before it, nothing. May
nard's speeches in euppcrt of the posi
tions of the protectionists before the
committee heretofore have been re
enunciations of the speeches of Schenck;
what Schenck stated with strength and
dignity, Maynard diluted and rambled
over, dragging the Globe with them,
lie leads a lonely life in Washington, so
lar as social associations are concerned,
he resides close down to the Capitol
gate, in that tlat part of the town where
when night descends, the very bats
retrain to go forth, because they can
get no companv;^^^^^

Our System of Practice.
The medical world has l>ecome divided
into ho many different cliques, isms ami
pathies, that our peculiar system of prac
tice m??y need some explanation.
Our remedies are principally vegetable,
discarding entirely the use of Cfitumvl or
Alcrcury in any form, believing it tojie a dis
ease-creating agent 01 the worst description.
We are also opposed to i lit- use of general
blood-letting in any c ise; believing it to be
injurious to the constitution, and often
times dangerous to life.
Our modeof detecting '"chronic affect ions"
of the Internal organs is principally by an
examination of the urine.
During t tie whole course of our study and
practice we have paid particular atten
tion to this old "German Mode"of detecting
disease, and we teel perfectly satisfied thai
"there is no more certain sign offered in
disease," than is presented in that secretion.
Therefore, we now more especially invite
all those laboring under any lingering dis
ease that has not been cured, because, per
haps the complaint was not proj>erly un
derstood, to send a vial of their urine tor ex
amination, and have the necessary medi
cines sent them. We wish it distinctly un
derstood that this "special" Invitati n is
given to those who have suniciently tried
the remedies of their family physician, and
have failed to obtain relief at his hand.
This is our privilege and riiilit as physi
cians, and it is the right and privilege of
the atllicled t?ob aiu their professional ad
vice and medicine where they choose. Our
ortice and residence Is at No. i::*2 Grant street,
Pittsburgh, where if any otheis choose to
apply we will givethein our best medical
attention, and will promi-e then relief in
every case where a reasonable hope can be
entertained.

Peril and Precaution.
Therein a season that tries the frame and
the constitution. If there be a weak spot
In either, tne chilling dampy, the malarious ]
fogs, the varieties ol temperature that mark
the commencement of the winter season
arc sure to find it out. There are few sys
tems that have not a weak spot somewhere,
ami tii* wisest thing that any man or wo
man can do is to fortify it by a course of
Hosteller's Stomach Bitters, and thus keep
the enemy at bay. In war, when a city is
menaced, the first tiling to be done is to
strengthen the rampart?. .The same policy
should be adopted with the human body, j
when its direst foe, malaria, is abroad. If
the stomach is weak, this tonic will lend it
vigor; it the bowels are morbidly sensitive,
this alterative will regulate them; if theliv
er is Inert, this wholesome stimulant will
rouse it; if there is constipation, this aper
ient will cure it; if there is nervous debility,
this nervine will replace it with nervous
vlgor?if there is impurity in the blood, tills
depurent will neutralize it; if there is a
cloud on the spirits, this exhllerant will
dispel it. These are facts that have been
demonstrated every day for the last twenty
years. Can as much be said for any other
.*ncdiciue->or rather, can as much be proved!
for anything may be said by the unscrupu
lous. Do not accept any of the local bitters
sometimes recommended by dealers in lieu
of the Standard Restorative.
