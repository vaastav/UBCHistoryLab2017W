Features of Pres. Wilson's Message.
The principal features of President
Wilson's message to Congress are as
follows:
It points out that the people of
Europe will soon be suffering for the
necessities of life and that we should
be ready to extend "our help and manifest
services."
Refers to the opportunity for supplying
the countries of Central and South
America, heretofore trading with
Europe, with articles of manufacture
and commerce; in this connection emphasizes
the need of building up the
merchant marine, the development of
which has been "stunted and hindered"
heretofore, and urges the passage of
the pending shipping bill.
Criticises the policy concerning our
natural resources, as "the laws we have
made do not intelligently balance en
couragement against restraint," and
urges the passage of pending bills concerning
use of water power and the
"unlocking of the resources of the
national domain."
Urges the passage of the Philippines
self-government measure.
Regrets that the rural credits legislation
probably cannot be enacted at
this session.
Urges the Senate to confirm the proposed
convention for safety at sea.
Recommends that Congress make
provision for the survey and the charting
of our coasts, especially the coast
of Alaska.
Urges economy in Government expenditures,
asserting that "the people
of the United States are not jealous of
the amount their Government costs, if
they are sure that they get what they
need and desire for the outlay"; that
the Government needs "systematic reorganization
and reassembling of its
parts so as to secure greater efficiency
and effect considerable saving in expense";
that it should be organized as
a business man would organize it; and
that "it is not expenditure but extravagance
that we should fear being
for."
As to national defense it is declared
that "we are the champions of peace
and concord"; that "we have had a
clear and settled policy," and "while
we retain our principles we never shall
have a large standing army; we shall
not turn America into a large military
camp; we shall not ask our young men
to spend the best years of their lives
making soldiers of themselves." In
lieu of this, it is suggested that the efficiency
of the national guard be increased
and that the citizenry of the
country be trained in the use of arms,
in drill and maneuver and the sanitation
of camps.
In reference to the Navy declares
that "we shall take leave to be strong
upon the seas," but only as a means of
defense, not conquest; that "the country
has been misinformed," and that
"we have not been negligent of
national defense."
County Attorney C. W. Herndon and
and Assessor F. L. Hunt departed
Wednesday evening last to Utah,
where they will look after important
matters for Mohave county. Under instruction
from the State Tax Commission
Mr. Hunt has had a large number
of wild horses rounded up in the
Hurricane plateau section, of our
northern strip, and will advertise them
for sale to pay the tax due the county
and state. His cowboys have notified
him that they have one hundred and
fifty of the horses corraled and it is to
sell them that the two county officers
are going into that country. Many of
these horses are well bred and the cowboys
in southern Utah often capture
them and break them to the saddle. It
is expected that many buyers will be on
hand to bid on the animals. Over the
plateau country are said to bo thousands
of wild horses, and unlike the
usual run of wild horses these have
gotten away from the herds of the cattlemen
of that country. It is the intention
of the Assessor to capture all the un-branded
horses possible and dispose of
them for the tax and expense of sale.

by H. H. Watkins.
H. H. Watkins, the well known banker
and business man of Kingman, returned
last Saturday from a hunting
trip into the country out toward Mount
Hope. He reports that he saw many
deer and that he secured two. The
Mount Hope country is one of the
best game sections in this part of the
State, but the Indians are gradually
exterminating all the big game. The
only game that these Indians allows to
escape their guns is the turkey and the
wild hogs. By using drastic measures
against the Indian the whole country
between Mohave and Yavapai counties
would soon be a hunter's paradise.

Corona Victory ;;ot the Fire:, Second and
Third honor in the Los Angeles -Phoenix
Race and First place in the El Paso-Phoenix
Event. These two races, known as the
"Cactus Derby," put tires to a grueling test of over
1200 miles of unfrequented, rough mountain trails
and burning debert sands. Heie all nature's wildest
forces were encountered, but Firestone, already
World Victorious, stood the test by winning these,
the greatest road races ever run.
This constant piling up of victory upon victory,
year after year, is significant.
This wonderful strength is built into every Firetono

The reason is in the making in tne abundance of
good rubber and the strongest f ibric built .nto a staunch
unit by the exclusive method of Firestone master workmen.
