Hi his
I The President
And Hawaii
President Roosevelt's message
in so far as it deals with Hawaii is
the writing of a friend who has
evidently given some study to con
ditions here. The cable reports
indicate that there is more space
devoted to Hawaii in this message
lhan in any other since the islands became a Territory. Not since the
lays when Hawaii was an international problem have we been dis
cussed at such length in a Presidential message. It is reasonable to
suppose that there will be a correspondingly large amount of attention
given to Hawaiian matters in the coming sessions of Congress.
The most important recommendation is the one relating to finances,
which is the result of a suggestion from here, originating, as the gov
ernor says, with District Attorney Brcckons. The President express
ly recommends that seventy-five per cent of our federal revenues be
set aside as a fund for educational purposes, construction of military
and naval defenses and for public buildings, in the islands. This would
mean an annual fund of about $Soo,ooo to be spent here by the federal
government, enough to make the difference between dull times and
prosperity in many lines of activity here. It would mean public im
provements on a splendid scale, and the development of military and
naval defenses which would call for large bodies of American soldiers
and seamen to be stationed here all the time, manifestly to the great
benefit of the community.
The recommendation as to labor was to have been expected. Even
leading local men who have utged the admission of Chinese in tlie
past, have of late changed their views in this respect. Judge Dole,
.who as governor recommended in his annual reports that Chinese be
admitted under proper restrictions, only recently published a thought
fully essay in which he took strong grounds in favor of securing only
immigrants. .capable of forming American citizenship. Our leading
employers of labor have turned to Europe for a supply of work
men, in sympathy with the natural American demand that the islands
be Americanized. On the very day that the news comes of the Presi
dent's eniphatic declaration against the admission of servile classes of
Asiatics, the news goes in the other direction that Hawaii is sending
to Europe for a thousand white families.
The recommendation as to Chinese is practically certain to be fal
lowed. It is a negative proposition, all Congress has to do is td
leave matters as they are as far as Chinese arc concerned, and that
. Congress will do. The need of fortifications has been pressed upon,
Congress so long that work will be needed to get appropriations start
ed, but it is evident that the President has very forcibly called atten
tion to the matter. The financial proposition is a new one, but start
; ing with the President's strong backing it has a fine chance. Citizens
.of the Territory who have influential friends at Washington, and
there are many of them, will do well to put in their words and help.

The naval demonstration of the

object is to compel the Sultan to
accept a scheme of financial reform in practically the whole of Euro

of taxes by the local authorities under supervision of the reprcsenta-,'in the transaction, unless it is a phi

It is not easy to concur with Mr. McCurdy that the life insurance
companies are eleemosynary and philanthropic, even if he does receive

which a man is afforded the means of buying life insurance. He pays
