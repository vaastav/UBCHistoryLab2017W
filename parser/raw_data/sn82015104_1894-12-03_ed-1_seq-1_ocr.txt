LITTLE LEGISLATION EXPECTED TO

Members of tiio Dominant Party in

Against the Admintstraiion—Tho
Senate Opens With a Full Calendar,
Covering a Wide ltange of Matters.
Bpsctal tnthe Bsxxkß-vumoK.
W.v -iiiNnTON, Dec. 2.—The second ses
sion ofthe Filly-third Congress begins at
noon to-morrow. Beyond the passing of
the regular appropriation bills, it seems
probable little in the way of legislation
will be accomplished at the short session,
although several important propositions
wiii doubtless be pressed to the front.
Among the members of tlie dominant
party in the House, over half of whom
tvere defeated for re-election, is a great
deal ol hitler feeling against the Admin
istration for real or fancied grievances. It
will be the purpose of the Democratic
leaders not to consider, as far as possible,
a display oi resentment, but the Republi
cans will spare no pams to provoke and
goad their defeated adversaries into let
ting loose their vials of wrath. If tiie
President outiiues a linancial scheme in
his message to-morrow, as is anticipated,
it wiii probably furnish the opponents of
iiis banking and linancial views their de
. opportunity.
In the course of the session it is under
stood the Nicaragua Canal project will
be brought prominently forward. A tthe
opening of Congress, however, routine j
.mailers will be kept to the lore, to stave '
off as far as possible unpleasant refer
ences to the election, which wouid prove
distasteful to the majority. But the pol- |
icy can be only partially successful, as j
the latitude allowed in debate upon bills
will throw the doors open to remarks on
any subject.
Before the adjournment for the holi
days it wili be necessary to pass an ap
propriation to carry out the tarilf bill
provision levying a tax on incomes, the
collection of which begins January Ist,
and while it will no doubt meet with
inucii opposition and leatl to a general
review of the arguments against Buch a
tax, lho general impression is that it wili
pass by a large majority.
The impeachment of Judge Ricks of
The Northern District of Ohio will also
Jurnish a diversion belore the holidays,
if tne Judiciary Committee, wiiich in
vestigated tho charges, should present a
resolution of impeachment, snd it should
.-any. The trial would occur in the
(Senate, the Chief Justice presiding. Im
peacbment proceedings are rare and
novel, and this ono, the tirst since the
trial of President Johnson, would at
tract no iittle attention.
To-morrow, if a quorum is present in j
the House, after mo cailmg of the roll i
nothing willlbo done probably beyond I
ceading of lho President's message, j
No definite programme has been ar- j
ranged lor the remainder of the week, j
Tbe Committee on Appropriations, how- j
ever, iias two bills almost prepared—tiie
pensions and lortilicaiions bills—ami j
they will be reported on Tuesday, so I
that work upon them can bo entered j
upon Wednesday.
The Senate will be called to order Mon
day, at 12 noon, when the last session of
tbe Fifty-third Congress will begin. Tiie
Vice-President is in the city, aud will ,
preside. Tho session will begin with a |
/uJI calendar, the result of committee
; „ uon during the long session, and it coi
]_ ci . ( sat least two hundred items, covering
awi 'ie range of matters. Nothing has
trans';. 5-"od l(J indicate which of the two
bundreu items will receive lirst attention,
■whether t.^y will be taken in their order,
or whether tiie calendar will bo followed
at all.
Much interest xs lelt among Senators
of all political .♦jelieis in tho President's
message, and in the recommendations
which ihe secretary of the Treasury wili
make on financial questions. These will
have much to do in -directing the course
of the Senate, if thoi'o aro recommenda
tions for radical departures on linancial
methods, they are sure to lead to much
speech making early in tho session, and
later to form tho basis of committee ac
tion.
•significance is also attached to Senator
Vest's declaration that he will asi_ the
Finance Committee to sit on Tuesday.
Tuesday is tbe day for tho regular meet
ing of this committee, "but it does noi
ordinarily meet so promptly after tho as
sembling of the Senate. Chairman Voor
hees declined to stale the opject of the
meeting, further tLau to say it is held for
tiie purpose of permitting an exchange
Of views among tho members. When the
President's message is received Monday
the executive recommendations could
oi course be taken, but as there had
been no positive assurance as to when j
tho message would como in wlien the ■
-meeting was decided on, it would appear
the Chairman had other objects in view.
It is possible bis purpose may be to ar
range a policy upon the supplemental
tariff bills. These bills have all been re
ported by the committee, but it may bei
considered necessary to discuss them
further belore deciding upon a plan of
action. The Democratic majority of iho
.Finance Committee is on record in favor
of the passage of ihe "pills, and it is not
improbable tiie early action of the com
mittee is sought to (rostrate any attempt
to provent consideration. This is not al
together surmised, for it is known mat
somo of the so-called conservative Sen
ators havo advanced the suggestion that a
general party coniereuce be heid alter the
Senate convenes for the consideration of
iia question. The experience of the last
session showed that whenever caucuses
-«••ere held the conservatives carried their
noints, hence there is reason for the
pro.'"!'l- action by friends of tho supple
mem~*xy bills.
There appears to be nothing outside of
linanci.il or taritl' questions likely to ex
ilea ripple during the week, and it is
not certain that whatever may happen
liter in the session there will be much in
-heir liufs to disturb the general serenity
of the Senate during tho next few days.
After tho receipt of tho President's mes
s-re and when it gots to business, the
Senate may take up Die calendar in regu
lar order or it may proceed to consider,
out of order, some of the more important
bills which have been reported, sucu as
those ior tbe admission ol Arizona and
New Mexico, or the bankruptcy, anti
option or Nicaragua Canal. In any event,
the daily sessions of tbe week will uo
short, with probabilities strongly in
favor of au adjournment from Inursday
to Monday of the week following.

CIVIL SERVICE.
Tho L_tW Hotter Observed In Ltf|oi'
l'ost-illices Than Ever Before.
"Washini. ton, Dec. 2.—Tho eleventh
annual report of the Civil Service Com
mission shows that from July 1, 1893, to
Jiiue 3U, 1894, there were 4,-J7_ appoint
ments made in tho classified service, an
increase of 83 over the previous year. The
number is divided as follows: Depart
mental service, 3"-*o; railway service, 718;
Indian servico, 166; Customs service, 280;
post service, 2,823.
ihe whole number of applicants exam
ined for the live blanches ol tne ciassiiied
service was 37,379, ol whom 22,1ui passed
and 15,240 failed to pass. The total num
ber examined is an increase on the year
ol 12,041, an increase of 8,861 iv the num
ber who passed, and 4,41b in the number
who lailed. Tho ligures lor the differ ent
branches are: Departmental service,
3,353 examined, of whom _,3U> passed;
radway mail -service, 4,_G7 examined.
1,120 passed; Indian service, 431 exam
ined, _90 passed; Customs service, 3,372
| examined, 2,012 passed; postal service,
i" T examined, 21,357 passed.
The report states that every state has
I received substautialli" its duo sliare of the
j appointments, any departure irom a
j mathematical apportionment being
passed by the need occasionally of Idling
i a piac-e requiring his technical qualifica
tions with the best qualified person with
out reference to his place of residence.
The commission claims that experience
I shows that all positions in the service,
with possibly a few exceptions, can bo
iiiied under the competitive system.
About one-ball of tho employes In tho
ciassiiied service are in 010 ciassiiied
Postoffices. The law, it is said, is now
belter observed in the large oiiices than
ever belore. Tho Baltimore oiiice is
cited as having been very badiy managed,
but is now weil conducted, as are also
lioston and Chicago. Politics is said to
be practically eliminated from the Post
ollice m making appointments. There
bave been complaints trom many ofthe
smaller oiiices, showing that a largo
i Dumber of removals have been made lor
' political reasons, although other offenses,
: generally of a minor character, a.c al
leged as the ground of the dismissal. In
I some oiiices there have been practically
clean sweeps.
The law has been rigidly observed in
the railway mail service, and no ap
pointments or removals have beeu made
ior political reasons. Appointments
nave been made without reference to
political considerations.
I Concerning offensive partisanship, the
commission says: "The rules against of
fensive partisanship are usually con
strued strictly against tiie opponents of
the party in power, and leniently
against their adherents. Persons iv the
ciassiiied service, though unrestricted as
to vote and opinions on all political sub
jects, should not take any active part in
I political management or political cam-
I paigns, and should be debarred irom
turning ollicial positions to tho beneiit of
i either political party."
Alter speaking of the conviction of Post
master Luokes of Newark. Ohio, and In
ternal Revenue Collector Rauey ot Ken
tucky, for making political assessments
in the Presidential campaign of 16.2, ref
erence is made to the case of C. 11. J. Tay
lor, Recorder of Deeds lor the District of
Columbia, of which a report is now in
the hands of the President for action. Of
this the commission says: "In investi
gating this case, the commission was
much struck by the condition of terror
ism that obtains iv the uuclassilied civil
service. Thero i.s no security for the fu
ture. Removals are made for purely
political and personal reasons, and there
is any amount of corruptness iv conse
quence. In the unclassified civil service
and in the excepted places at \Vashiug
tou the conditions are as bad as evor.
These evils will be largely cured by the
recent extension of classification in the
departmental service."
The commission reviews the attempts
made at assessment in the campaigu of
1894, and the opinion of the Attoruey
tioueral that solicitation by letter in pub
lic oiiices is not solicitation within the
lav.-, and alter reviewing recent exten
sions, cites the fact that there are few im
i -rtitnt branchea of the Govornment
service yet uuclassilied.

Washington, Dec. _". —Tho roport of
Hou. James 11. Eckels, Comptroller of
tlie Currency, submitted to Congress to
day, gives lull information in regard to
the organization,supervision and liquida
tion of the nationid batiks for the year
einled October 31, IS'.»4. ll shows that
during this period but liny banks were
organised, with a capital stock of $5,285,
--000, the smallest Dumber chartered, as
well as tho minimum amount of capital,
in auy year since 18791 Of those new
hanks twenty-seven are iv the Northern
and Eastern .--tales, ten in tho ."Southern
.States and thirteen in the Western or
transtnisaissippi division.
On October 31, 1894, the total number oi
national banks iv operation was 3,756,
with an authorized capital stock of ?*>7_,
--671,365, represented by 7,! i. r>o f o7t' shares ol
stock owned by 287,892 shareholders. On
October •_, L 894, tiie date of tho last report
ol tho condition of national banks, tho
total resources ofthe banks were $3,473,
--922,055, of which their loans and discounts
amounted to $2,0(17,122,191, and money of
all kinds in bank -*-4__,-l_S,l'.»_. Of their
liabilities $1,728,418,819 represented in
dividual deposits, $334,121,082 surplus
and net undivided profits, and si7_,o.i,
--978 circulating notes outstanding.
The total circulation of national banks
on October 31, lfe!»4, amounted to $207, 172,
--tW-'J, a net decrease during tue year of
$1,741,563, and a gross decrease of $8,614,
--ty>4 in circulation secured by bonds.
During the year sevonty-nine banks,
with an aggregate capital stock of $.0,
--475,000, passod out of the Bystem by voi
uutary liquidation. Twenty-one, in
cluding two which foiled in 1893, with a
capital stock of $3,770,000, became in
solvent, aud were placed iv chargo of re
ceivers.
The feature of the ("oiiipiroller's report
is his discussion ol the currency question,
and the defects which are said to exist
in tho note-issuiug powers vested in
national banks. On this subject he says:
"No section of the law should bo dis
turbed which cannot oe material ly im
proved upon, and no amandin ..i en
grafted unless such amendment will
work better results than follow from the
existing order of things. From the* pres
ent law it must be considered as success
ful iv every material feature, excepting
in the matter of banknote issue, and here
the failure has beeu but a partial one.
The notes issued by the banks under gov
ernmental supervision have been uni
form iv appearance, aud under any aud
all circumstances of the full face value
which they purport to carry, 'inoy have
possessed the tirst requisite of a good
banknote issue—immediate controverti
bility iuto coin upon presentation.
"It is probable Uiore could be no better
plan for securing the note holder against
loss thau the present requirement of a
deposit of bonds to secure a bank's circu
lation, but it is equally certain, however,
that a method could be devised not less
safe in this respect —au addition thereto
possessing that which is essential and is
now wholly wanting, elasticity of issue.
The complaints, therefore, made against.
the present system is that, having in
elasticity of issue, it fails to meet as luliy
as it ought the varying wants of tiio
country's trade and commerce. This de
fect must attach to overy scheme for a
currency issued by the banks against a
deposit of bonds, tho market value of
which lluctuates while the percentage of
issues, less than the valuo oi the bonds
grained tho banks, remain unchanged.
It must also bo wauling in sum a method
because of the delay in the face of a press
ing need, occasioned by a tight money
market or other reasons, in securing and
depositing the bonds required ami taking
out the circulation thereon.
"But sorious as is this fault, and re
tarded as it is to tho business interests
of the country, any attempt to romedy it
which should lose sight of or in any wise
make less certain the present unques
tioned credit and convertibility of tho
bank issues of the country, could not be
justified, it is a duty of Governments to
see that the currency which circulates
among the people shall always be of the
very nighest character, the soundness of
which should never be a subject for in
jury. For thirty years the American
people have had such a bank currency,
and having Been tho valuo of it both here
and abroad, they will not be content to
have any innovation made unless such
new departure insures not ouly equal,
but better results.
"It is respectfully suggested that not
only as good, but betier, results would
be attained if the present iiank Act were
amended by repealing tho provision
thereof requiring each bank, as a pre
requisite to entering the system and is
stnug banknote currency, to deposit. Gov
ernmeut bonds, in lieu of such pro
vision there should be substituted oue
permitting the batiks to issue circulating
notes on their assets to an amount equal
at least to 60 per cent, of their unimpaired
capital." •**
The Comptroller follows the sugges
tions with the further one of the main
tenance of a safety fund, to be provided
by graduated legislation upon the out
standing circulation of the banks until it
shall be equal to uot less thau 5 per cent.
of the total of such outstanding circula
tion, the money to be held in trust by the
Government. It is Immediately to bo re
plenished out of the assets, on which it
shall have a lirst and permanent lien, and
from assessment to the exteut of tho
double liability on the shareholders.
The Comptroller says: "Whatever
other changes, If any, it would be neces
sary lo make in the present system rela
tive to current redemption of bauk notes
and the Government's position toward
Isamo and kindred matters, it is not
essary to set forth. If the reeoui
ldations here made, together with
i winch will follow, should receive
Kid-nation at the hands of Congress,
11 drawn after a carelul study and in
ligatiou of the whole subject would
essarily embody ail the details iuci
it to a change from a bond to a satety
d necessary as a basis of bank circula
i."
The Comptroller then cites such proof
and gives such statistics as seem to him
to make the plan suggested a perfectly
safe one to enter on. He says: "The
change thus outlined will, upou investi
gation, it is believed, prove to be sale in
affording complete security to the note
holder, aud to the business interests of
the country a bank note issue responsive
io their needs."
Continuing, the Controller says: "Tho
profit upon the issue of circulation to the
banks by such change would be so aug
mented that.it is giving to them a fran
chise for which it is suggested they should
be called upon to make proper return to
the General Government. This return
s-hould not, however, be of such a charac
ter as to defeat the ends sought In the
privilege. The Goneral Government
ought to be wholly free from tho direct
issning'and redeeming of notes to pass as
money among the people. In the light of
the present condition of ihe Govern
ment's nnance, that which ought to have
been done when there was a surplus in
the Treasury cannot now be undertaken,
but ihe same conditions must continuo to
weaken the country's credit and plague
the lines ot business unless a means is de
vised for removing theso issues from the
channel of current redemption until
such time as the Government finds itself
in a position to do that which at first !
was ihe intent of all, gradually redeem
and cancel them. The ultimate redemp
tion of coin, of course, must all be upou
tbe Government, but the embarrassment
does not arise from their ultimate but
their current redemption.
"ll is therefore suggested that if Con
gress shall repeal tho provisions ofthe
present Act requiring the national banks i
to make a deposit of Govorumont bonds •
in order to Bee ure circulating notes, and j
substitute therefor a provision giving j
them instead the right to issue the same
against their assets, it incorporate I
therein and as a part thereof, thai as a j
prerequisite to so doing the banks be
compelled to deposii with tho Treasurer |
of tho United Slates legal tender issues !
or issues under tho Act of 1-SIH3 equal in !
amount to the difference between the por- '
centsge of their capital stock of issue i
(■ranted against their assets and the total '
Of such capital stock. Tho deposits thus
mado ought to remain with the Treas
urer until the bank ceased, either I
through voluntary or involuntary liqui- \
dation, to do business, aud in either caso I
the Government ought thon to redeem i
and cancel such treasury issues de- j
posited.
"As against this deposit of legal tender
and treasury notes so made, there should ]
be issued to the banks, dollar for dollar, j
national bank notes, either of the same
or different designs, as might be deemed j
best. The percentage of the bank notes j
issued against this deposit should be free
from any taxation imposed upou circuia- j
tion, and ought to bo such percentage as
is deemed equitable to be used as a part j
of the bank's legal reserve held against !
such deposit.
"The Government should not under
take or in any wise become responsible
for the current redemption of these notes.
Its responsibility should end with its re
demption of the notes deposited to secure
such circulation when the bank ceases to
exist. At present, a curreut redemption
fund of T» per cent, of tne outstanding cir
culation is found sullicient, aud it is prob
able that in the future uo greater amount
would be required.
"Tho elasticity of issue in the national
bank circulation will be found in the per
centage of issue against assets subject to
the necessary rate of taxation, insured by
an adequate safety fund to guarantee the
note holders against loss. The Govern
ment will be aided, the bank giveu in ex
change a dollar for every dollar deposited,
and thus relieved of the loss iucideut to
tho depositing of au amouut equal to
its capital stock in excess for the notes
granted it.
"It is suggested that as a necessary ele
ment in securing tho proper elasticity
iasuo in our bauk note currency, Section
!», Act of July 12, l>'i_, regulating the re
tirement and issuiug of circulation to
banks within a lixed period of time,
should be repealed, aud also that an
amendment should be made to the law
necessitating the banks keoping in tho
olhce of tho Comptroller of Currency a
sullicient amount of blank notes as will
enable theni to secure circulation at once
instead of alter a period of tiolay.
"Suggestions have boen received from
many ennnont sources that the whole
question ofa banking and currency sys
tem ought to be reierred by Congress to a
committee, to be created by law, ap
pointed by the President and clothed
with the proper authority. A commis
sion, non-partisan in character, com
posed of men of eminent abilities, could
unquestionably devise a currency sys
tem sound in every part, and ono Which
would commend itself to every interest
ofthe country. It could largely take tho
quosiiou out of politics, aud have it con
sidered simply in its business aspects and
upon its merits, but if the present Con
gress is to enact a law upon tho subject
the appointment of a commission couid
avail nothing."
MERCHANT MAKINE.
Commissioner of Kavlgadoa Charuber-
lain Argues I'or Freo Ships.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.—The annual re
port of tho Commissioner of Navigation,
Eugene F. Chamberlain, is mainly an
argument for Iroo ships, based on ths
maritime standing and policy of the
United States with other nations. He
says that American enterprise is a century
ahead of tho law, for Americans own
more steamships lorbidden by the
registry law to wear American colors
thau there are American ships iv foreign
trade under the stars and stripes, and tho
admission of such vessels lo American
registry is desirable to advance our mari
time rank.
In thirty years only one American
steamship has visited Hamburg, ami last
year two sailing vessels entered the har
bor. Every bushel of erain which left
New York for Europe last year was car
ried under a foreign flag. Of 11,000 vessels
passing the Suez Canal in the last three
years, only six had been American.
Every civilized nation but the United
Slates allows its citizens tbe uso of the
national tlag over vessels in loreign trade,
wherever bought, having learned that
othorwise they will buy vessels under
loreign flags, charter such vessels or
abandon navigation altogether to loreign
rivals.
Tho report shows the extent to which
Americans have adopted these courses
and the country's consequent ioss of
maritime prestige ami profit, other na
tions, according to the Commissioner,
realize that from tho freedom of the seas
a prohibitory registry law cannot act as a
protective tariff for ship-building, so they
have abandoned it. Those undertaking
to promote ship-building resort to sub
sidies. Pree registry and subsidies aro
not contiictiug propositions—one en
couraging navigation, the other ship
building. The report says only .'J per
cent, of the Dritish merchant marine re
ceive any Government compensation,
and that discriminating Hag taxes have
been abandoned by maritime nations, as
they invitea relation which nullities pros
pective benefits.
Amendments to the net tonnage and
tonnage tax laws, the abolition of registry
bouds aud an extension of the power of
tho Secretary of the Treasury to mitigate
or remit penalties on sailing vessels are
recom mended.

ENGLAND'S STRATEGIC MOVE.
Her Object in Hastening to Sign a
Treaty With Japan.
DONE TO PREVENT RUSSIA GAINING
POWER IN THE EAST.
Belief ot Many In the Orient That tho
Victories of the Japs in China are
Duo to the Chiuese Following tho
Advice of General Gordon, That if
an Enemy Invaded the Country to
ltotroat Until the Enemy's Troops
Wore Well ln the Interior aud Then
Tarn tho Chinese Hordes Upon
Them aud Annihilate Thorn.
Special to the Rkcoud-Uniox.
Tacoma. Pec 2.— lv an interview in
the Ledger. Captaiu John Panton, it. N.
P., master of the Victoria, says it is cur
rent gossip and generally believed on
"the other side" that England had a deep
object in hastening to sign a treaty with
Japan several months ago, alter Japan
had won several victories. Tho supposed
object was to form an alliance with the
Power likoly to control tho Corean situa
tion, in order to prevent Rossis from
gaining power in that strategic quarter
of the globe—strategic particularly from
Russia's point of view, since her chief
Siberian port, Vladivostock, is blockaded
with ice hau tho year. Dy remaining
friendly with Japau, it is fully believed
that England will keep the Czar out oi'
Corea.
Mauy people iv the orient are begin
ning to ihink, Captain Panton says, that
Chiua has adopted and is now putting
into practice the advice given to Viceroy
La Hung Chang by General Cordon of
tho Dritish army alter the Taping rebel
lion. His opinion was that if evor au
army iuvadotl China, to retreat, retreat,
retreat, until the enemy's troops wore
well in the interior, aim then to turn tho
Chineso hordes upou ihom aud annihilate
them.
Captaiu Panton says: "The result of
this war is hard to forecast. If it is true
lhat the Chinese are carrying out Cor
don's advice, which seems guile prob
able, they will yet swamp the Japanese.
Vet if tho Chiuese allow such places as
Port Arthur to be taken, one cannot tell
what io expect. Port Arthur was a Gib
raltar. It had new guns from Europe
only a few mouths ago, aud was sup
posed to bo impregnable. It looks as if
the Chinese Mandarins and Taotais
wanted to overthrow tho Mancburian
dynasty, and were playing iuto Japan's
hands.
-'Everybody in the Orient is disgusted
withthe way things aro going in China,
and the rotten state that country is in. It
is common gossip that the Mandarius
and Taotais draw money in large sums
from tho Government lor ammunition
and supplies to maintain their troops,
and thai tbey upend most of the money
tor themselves or hoard it lor future use.
it is the most r_rteu state of atlairs that
was ever seen iv any country in the
world.
"Auy one who has a pull with a .Man
darin can get a position of somo kind.
I'or instance, a framder with a pull may
be put iv as Captain of a vessel in the
navy. This system permeates Chiua
through and through. There it is called
the Mandarin squoe/.e. Tho term ap
plies particularly to what wouid be
called a * rake-off' in this country.
Large contracts fur Govorumont supplies
are let, it is understood, with the under
standing thai the ollicials get a good per
centage of tbe contract price Irom the
contractors. Sometimes the supplies are
not purchased, or ouly in very small
quantities.
"lt seems to be pretty well settled that
the Chinese had used up all their powder
and ammunition wheu the fighting was
linished at tho battle of tho \ alu Kiver.
If China's ileet had had plenty of ammu
nition it should havo sunk tho whole
-lapaneso lleet, unless the Japs ran away.
The Japanese wero willing to quit fight
ing, not knowing tbe Chiuese wero out
of powdor and shell. Had they known
it then, they might have demolished tho
Chineso lleet.
"No; 1 do not think Di Hung Chang is
in the scheme to overthrow tho Govern
ment, if ono oxisls. lie is handicapped
by China's conservatism aud apathy to
modern improvements aud modern ways
of lighting."
NO AIM'KKIfKNSION* FOB THE SAFETY OF
A M BR]< A N B iSS 11' I:x TS.
Washington, Doc 2. —It is stated pos
itively at the Department of State tbat
there is no fresh reason for apprehension
touching the safety ol American residents
in Rekiu, and that United States Minister
Deuby has not mado any appeal to the
department for protection since his orig
inal dispatch sent some time ago, and re
ferred to at tho time in the Associated
l'ress dispalclies, ie which he stated that
should tbe Japanese troops attack. Rekiu
the safety of the foreign residents might
be threatened, aud it would bo well to
send a force of Limed States troops to
protect the Legation.
As is customary in such cases, this dis
patch was promptly communicated to
the Navy Department, ami lilty marines
were ordered lo bo transferred from the
other vessels of tho Amorican lleot to the
Monocacy at Tien-Tsin, near i'ekin. Iv
addition Admiral Carpenter was instruct
ed to put himself in communication With
Minister Deuby, and to use his own dis
cretion to do anything to insure the safety
ol tho American residents. All this took
place some time ago, and since then Mr.
Deuby has made uo further application
lor protection, ile is at liberty anj' tune
to translor his legation to Tien-Tsin,
where it would be almost under tho guns
of the Monocacy, and in fact !io was au
thorized io do this at a very early stage of
the war, when tho Chinese showed symp
toms of disaffection at the lirst reverses
sustained by thoir armies. The logation
was cariaiuly much safer at Tien-Tsin
then at l'okiu, as it i.s impossible for oven
the light-draft Monocacy to navigate tho
river up to the latter city at this season of
the year. But tho fact that Mr. Denby,
although the means of communication
are open, bai not recently asked for aid
from the department, is regarded as evi
dence that he feels no apprehension at
present, and this view is supported by
i ihe cable advices from Chee !• oo to tho
1 ellect that, encouraged by the prospect of
j a restoration of peace, many of the for
! eign residents at l-ekiu who have taken
j refuge in Tien-Tsin were returning to
Pekin.
JAPANESE ATROCITIES AT PORT ARTHIII.
London, Dec. 2. —A correspondent of
the Ftmea telegraphs as follows from
Hiroshima, Japan: "I have just re
turned from the seat of war, aud had a
conversation with Viscount Mussa Mu
nomitau, tho Foreign Minister, in regard
to misconduct of the Japauese at Port
Arthur. 1 informed him that I had
watched the Japanese army enter that
town. The Chinese resisted to the last.
1 saw Chinese in plain clothes with lire
arms concealed ou their persons. I also
found explosive bullets. The Japanese
reported that civilians fired upon them
Irom their houses, and they therefore
deemed it necessary to exterminate them.
The Japanese were further excited by
finding the mutilated remains ofthe Jap
anese soldiers. Some of them had beeu
buried alive. I saw no resistance in the
town during tho next lour days. The
.Japanese pillaged the whole town, and
killed almost every man. Very few of
the women or children wore killed.
Thoso killed were probably killed unin
tentionally. I saw scoi-63 of Chiuese
prisoners pinioned, disemboweled and
dismembered. Mauy bodies wero par
tially buried.
"Tlie foreign Minisistcr expressed him-
Belf as intensely surprised and grieved.
Hitherto, he Added, the Japanese army
bad been admired for its humanity and
discipline. He was unwilling to believe
it possible that they acted as reported, or
to express au opinion on the subject
until detailed official reports arrived.
Meanwhile he authorized me to say that
be waa certain the Government was sin
cerely determined to act on principles of
humanity and civilization," and was
firmly resolved to maintain the honor oi
Japan and refute Chinese slanders. lam
satisiied the Government de-sires neither
to conceal the truth uor to permit
slanders."
A Chee Foo dispatch to the Time* says
it is reported that the Japanese lleot is
desirous of taking a more prominent
part in the war. The licet was seen off
Wei Hai Wei, but has now dissapueared.
Wei Hai Wei is strongly defended. The
Chinese fieel was still inside the harbor.
Reinforcements are beiug poured in
from tho land side. Geueral Alge is in
command. He is a brave and competent
officer, aud is assisted by several foreign
ers. The Chinese people fear that if
peace is made tho disbanded troops will
commit outrages. Iv a few days time all
traffic north will close. The Japanese
will have to act quickly if they intend to
attack Pekin.
Tho last reliable reports from Choc Foo
state that Japan informed the American
.Minister that she is willing to negotiate
if China sues for peace. This Chiua has
done, so au armistice is likely to be ar
ranged.
PEACE NEGOTIATIONS PROCEEDING.
Tokio, Dec. 2.—Peace negotiations are
proceeding. The Minister oi Foreign
Ailairs has handed to United Stales
Minister Dunn a counter proposition for
transmission to United States .Minister
Deuby. Owing to the secrecy surround
ing the negotiations it is impossible at
this stage to discover tbe exact naturo of
this counter proposition, but it is sup
posed to differ from Minister Deuby's
i original proposition maiuly in rospeci to
j the amouut of the indemnity niado by
Japan, and iv tho addition ol certaiu
rather onerous guarantees for tho faithful
execution of China's pledge, lt is
rumored that oue ol theso guarantees is
tho continuation ol the JaDatiese occupa
tion of Port Arthur uutil the treaty con
ditions are fulfilled, but it is apprehended
i such a demand may involve (.ireat
Britain, to which such occupation would
be obnoxious.
A lu-'XIAI. FBOM DETBXNG,
Yokohama, Dec. 2.—Mr. Dotring, the
envoy who visited Japan lor the purpose
of negotiating peace, and whoso mission
proved a failure, the Japanese Ministers
declining to meet bim, has written a let

ALABAMA'S DUAL GOVERNMENT.
A Quiet Sunday at Monttromory—Split
in the Populist Ranks.
Montoomery (Ala.), Lee. 2. —In spite
of her dual Government, Alabama has
enjoyed a peaceful and quiet Sunday.
Most of the visitors, includiug the twenty
six companies of Stato troops, left tho
city soon after midnight last night. Tho
council of the Populist leaders, for which
a call was issued last week, was not hold.
It has developed that there is a decided
split in the ranks ou the inauguration
move. It is said Kolb determined upon
his inauguration schemo without consult
ing any of his party leaders, and that it
has unquestionably produced friction in
the ranks.
The Democratic Icadors here believo
Kolb wants to put himself ou record.
They believe his scheme is to send a mes
sage to the Legislature demanding: a lair
election coutost Jaw. He wili, as <iov
ernor, givo Warren Reese a certificate of
election as Senator, and wiii issue similar
certificates lo the four or live contesting
Cougrossioual delegates. Governor Oales
will sign the certilicales of tho gentlemen
declared to bo elected, and Koli* hopes
that the Republicans and Populists in the
House will settle the contests, and thereby
virtually recogui/.e his as the proper ac
credited credentials.
A meeting of tho Kolbites is called for
to-morrow. No one can tell at this time
what is to become of the message to be
scut to tho Legislature until tho meeting
to-morrow determines.

Seattle, Dec. 2.—The air was suffici- '
ently clear to-day to permit of Mount
Ranier being plainly seeu, aud there now

that no trouble occurred there, but below,

interest has beeu aroused here over the
check for a million and a half which
(lauso Spreckels, the sugar king, drew
Saturday on tho Nevada Dank. Tho
