spread expressions of. approval, al
though some declared one or more 06
the executive's proposals would be
difficult, ir not impossible of early en
actment. Immediately after the joint session
the senate pi'ssed a bill urged by Sec
retary Hoover as head of the Ameri
can Relief Administration, authoriz
ing donation to the administration of
surplus medical and other stores of
the army.
Legislation to meet the president's
recommendations for a flexible tariff
was also proposed immediatelo by
Senator Smoot. Republican. Utah. He
intrortwed amendments to the tariff
bill which would authorize the presi
dent, bv proclamation, to reduce or
inrreas'i tariff rates based on Amer
ican valuation. Hearings on the tariff
hill will he resumed tomorrow by the
senate finance committee.
The president also emphasized
need for agricultural relief. He urged
improved methods of distribution and
marketing or farm products, advocat
ing leiiislath? assistance to co-operative
marketing. Railroad freight
rats. he added, were subjects of just
complaint by farmers.
Other recommendations included
reclamation and irrigation develop
ment, highway improvement and
measures to aid the unemployment
situation. '
Praises Budget System
The piesident expressed satisfac
tion over the tax revision law and its
"h!.llion dollar reduction in the tax
draft on the people," and urging econ 1
oniy and efficiency, declared the bud
get system "the greatest reformation
in governmental practices since the j
beginning of the republic." I
Party resnonsibility in government
was stressed by the president In what
some of his hearers regarded as thin
lv veiled dislike over the "bloc- depart
ment in congress."
A
Gomoers Disagrees
WASHINGTON. Dee. 6. President
Harding's suggestion, made in his
message today, for a court to decide
wages and conditions of employment,
was declared to be a "reversion to con
ditions obtaining more than 400 years
ago," in a statement issued tonight by
Samuel Gomoers. president of the
American Federation of Labor.
"The president's message is in most
respects an admirable document," the
stptement said, "but he .like too manp
men. fails in his understanding of the
relations between workers and em
ployers, of the aspirations which are
in the hearts and minds of the great
mass of our people.
"Indeed, the president's proposaj
for the establishment of a court with
leral powers to decide as to wages
and conditions of employment is noth
ing- moro nor less , than a reversion
back to the conditions obtaining more
than 400 years ago when the court of
quarter sessions determined the
wages of the workers and prohibited
them from asking for more, or em
ployers from paying more than the
court's decision and to condemn men
to compulsory servitude and slavery
if they resented in any way the de
cisions of those courts."
tha( either new proposals would be
in his hands by Tuesday or the ne
gotiations would be finished.
The signing took place in the his
toric cabinet room, the premier and
Arthur Griffith being the first to
sign, after which all the members
shook hands around.
Today, the atmosphere at Downing
street was most cheerful. The Irish
delegates are returing home fully sat
isfied with the result of the negotia
tions. They expect some opposition
in the Dail Eireann, but they have
l'ttle apprehension as to the outcome.
In the first place, their free state
is acknowledged by the government,
which will go a long way with the
rank and file among the Sinn Feiners.
In the next place, Lloyd George,
Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith
aie given the greatest credit for the
success of the conference, through
the premier had the loyal support of
Austen Chamberlain and Lord Birk
enhead. Michael Collins, who had planned
to go to Dublin, changed his mind
and remained here with Griffith anil
bis other colleagues. Eamonn de Va
lera, so far, has declined to comment.
Lrbor Is Jubilant
Arthur Henderson, labor leader,
says that the whole British labor
movejnent will welcome the settle
ment with joy.
Austen Chamberlain and Lord Birk
enhead both addressed meetings at
Birmingham tonight.
Chamberlain asserted that the gov
ernment had been true to the letter
and spirit of its pledges. The settle
ment provided all essential conditions
of national and imperial security.
Lord Birkenhead said he has risk
ed everything on his belief in the
pood faith of tho Irish delegates. This
issue was the most vital on which a
British cabinet fcad pronounced for
240 years.
"We have made up our minds,
ri.ihtly we believe," he announced.
"We have put everything to the haz
ard. When this ,'Fttlement is u
cepted, there will meet at Downing
street a'new partner of the empire;
her spokesman, the Irish prime minis
ter, will , meet . on equal terms with
the prime minister of Great Britain."
Babe Ruth Is Fined
All Prize Money in
Last World Series
CHICAGO, Deo. X.. "Badne ws"
for "Babe" Ruth, world's champion
home run hitter with the New York
Yankees, broke today. Ruth was fin
ed his world's series prize of 3,3G2,
and suspended until May 20 or the.
1922 season by Judge Landis, com
missioner of baseball, for participat
ing in exhibition games following the
close of the world's series.
Outfielder Bob Meusel and Pitcher
William Piercy, also members of the
Yankees, who participated In tie
barnstorming trip, drew substantially
the same penalties. Piercy's fine was
$100 less than the other two, his
share in the world's scries being that
much less.
Suspension of Ruth for at least the
first month of the American league
pennant race practically means, base
ball observers poin-ed out, that he
will have little chance next season
of breaking his record of 59 home
runs. He will not be eligible to ap
ply for re-instatcment until May 20
the season starts about April 14.
The decision, which, in the base
ball world, is -the most important
Judge Landis has made, came after
two months deliberation.
The rule, enacted in 1911. forbids
a member of a team competing the
world's championship seriet; from
participating in any exhibition games
after the close of the series.
