tinues to flow into the Saltón Sea SALTON SEA AND
IMPERIAL COUNTRY.
An Interesting Array of Facts by One
Competent to Speak.
The unusual rise In the Colorado
river at this time, and the failure of
the engineers to stop the flow of that
stream into the Imperial canal in
take, has aroused new interest and
new speculation concerning- the Sal
ton Sea and the possible fate of the
rich farming section known as the
Imperial valley. Sometime ago En
gineer George Y. Wisner, of the
reclamation service, was widely
quoted in the newspapers in this
matter and he was interviewed upon
the subject by a Republican reporter:
The Saltón . basin and Imperial
country, says Mr. Wisner, was origi
i ji -i i .
nany Deyonu a aouot part oi trie
Gulf of California. The Colorado
river began the formation of a delta
or sand beds along its west bank and
these were gradually added to until
the Imperial country was formed, the
Saltón Sea being the part of the gulf
that was cut off. As this new land
oa the west was formed the river
gradually bore to the left, cutting
the channel to the gulf now recog
nized as its natural bed. The Saltón
sink being cut off from any great
supply of water gradually evapor
Uted, leaving in its bottom a vast
amount of salt which deposit was ad
ded to by the washing of the salt left
on its sides, down into the basin, by
the action of rains and torrential
streams. The matter of elevations
is the next thing to consider. The
water service of the Saltón Sea,
that is the -water level, at the pres
ent time is about 2G0 feet below sea
level. Imperial, on the canal, which
is now carrying almost the entire
Colorado river, is about sixty feet
below sea level, and the canal head,
is 100 feet above sea level. Imperial,
therefore is 160 feet lower than the
intake, though yet 200 feet above
the water service of the Saltón Sea.
It is estimated that it might take the
river ten or twelve years, perhaps
longer, depending on the annual pre
cipitation in the southwest, to ulti
mately fill the sink to a point ap
proaching sea level, but fill it is
bound to do unless prevented by the
enterprise of human agency. The
certainty of this result can be under
stood by the fact that the fall from
the intake south to the gulf through
the hitherto established bed of the
river? So great is this difference
that the service level in the canal
just below the intake is five feet
lower than the old bed of the river
at a point just below the intake, and
which latter channel was dry when
Mr. Wisner visited the place in
August. It should be stated here
that just below the intake is an is
land in the old bed and the channel
above referred to is the one between
the island and the California side
At tnat time tnere was ouly a very
few inches of water runninir throu-rh
the channel on the eastern side of
the island, a flow one could easily
roll up his pants and wade across
Since then, newspaper reports have
stated that this channel was almost
as dry as the other, at least until the
recent flood.
When Mr. Wisner visited Yuma
last August he found 8500 second feet
of water flowing by that city, just
aoout tne same volume that was
flowing there one year before. But
he was somewhat startled to discover
that the bed of the river- was two
feet lower at Yuma than it was the
year before.
The natural conclusion is that the
current caused by the rush into the
intake below had already scraped
two feet off the bottom of the river
as far up as Yuma, twelve miles
above the intake. With a fall of 100
feet between the intake and Im
perial, and a still greater fall be
tween that point and the Saltón Sea,
one can scarcely appreciate what the
old river may do in a few years in
the way of digging out its own bot
tom in the vicinity of Yuma.
The suggestion has been made by
some one that even if the'river con
the evaporation will equal its vol
ume. Figures again prove the con
trary. The area of the Saltón sink
at sea level is about 1,000,000 acres.
The annual evaporation in those
parts is about eight feet of water or
a total for the entire area of 8,000,
000 acre feet. Against that the an
nual average discharge of the Colo
rado river is 11,000,000 acre feet.
There would then be an annual gain
of 3,000,000 acre feet over any possi
ble evaporation.
In respect of how to prevent what
seems at first thought to be the in
evitable, there are two or three pro
jects under way that will certainly
prove of great benefit and many oth
ers may be devised before there is
wide disaster. Of those assured Mr.
Wisner makes particular mention of
the Laguna project. When that is
completed and thousands of acres be
low it are brought under cultivation
a vast amount of this water will be
utilized. When the Roosevelt dam is
completed a very large part of the
water of the Gila river, one of the
Colorado's main tributariis, will
never get as far as Yuma. There
are other storage projects contem
plated on the tributaries of the
Colorado that will further lessen its
volume and what may be the
fruits of further study on the part of
engineers no one can tell. The situa
tion therefore, is not all black for
the Imperial country and there may
be yet many ways of preventing the
thing that would result disastrously
were nature left to her own devices.
It is the judgment of those posted,
that this is only a repition of geologi
cal history. There is a legend among
the Indians of Southern California
that this same filling of the sink oc
curred about ai long ago as the lives
of four old men by which one might
arrive at about 350 years ago. Mr.
Wisner says that on the inclined
plain or shore of the present Saltón
sink have been found three fresh
water beaches; that is three beaches
believed to have been formed bv
fresh water for the reason that the
shells found there are the same as
found in fresh water. This suggests
three inundations before the present
ce. The theory is that when the
river fills the sink to water level or
so high the current ceases, it begins
to form bars across its own pathway
just as the Imperial country was
originally formed, then gradually
throws its current to the east finding
a more rapidly receding elevation to
ward the sea through what is now the
old river bed. Then when that is
filled by bars or some artificial or
other channel cuts in again from the
west as it did in the construction of
the Imperial conal, it again turns its
face to the westward with the Saltón
sea for its destination. The move
ments of the river are of more than
passing interest to engineers for that
it is the ouly big river that within
the memory of the present genera
tion has literally taken up its bed
and walked without at least scatter
ing a few of the blankets. Republi
can. The Presidential Stroke.
The recommendation of President
Roosevelt in regard to the admission
of Arizona and New Mexico as one
state has not come to The Republi
can as a surprise, though there is an
unreasonable bluntness in it which
was not expected. The paper has
long been aware that the president
favored joint statehood, if indeed he
was not the first to, suggest it as a
solution of the vexing statehood
problem.
Nearly two years ago former Dele-
gate Rodey, of New Mexico, made
the public statement that President
Roosevelt told him that he was in
favor of jointure and this statement
though repeatedly made was never
denied by the president orby any one
qualified to speak for him. The ques
tion was brought up at a territorial
convention held at Tucson for the
purpose of selecting delegates to the
republican national convention of
1904. Governor Brodie, a member of
the convention denied that those
were the views of the president, and
he sent -a telegram to him requesting
him to support the denial. That
telegram was never answered.
In however high respect the presi
dent may be held, his opinions on the
subject of statehood will be treated
here with no respect at all, nor will
his frequent advocacy of the "square
deal" so often reiterated as to have
become commonplace, be understood
to have any application to Arizona.
It cannot be urged by his friends in
this part of the world that his recom
menoation is tne expression ot an
honest but mistaken opinion. The
president has had the subject laid be
fore him by impartial investigators
of conditions in the territory by men
who had no material interest in Ari
zona, and they left him with the con
clusion that the president had been
impressed with the truth of their re
ports. Besides, if this information
had not been brought to him it might
have been presumed that he would
have sought the fullest knowledge of
conditions before launching that
characteristically, dictatorial recom
mendation for the commission of .the
most fragrant political outrage ever
attempted or proposed in this course
Congress according to the terms of
the recommendation of President
Roosevelt is relieved of the task of
deliberation. "There is," says he,
"no justification for further delay
and the advisability of making the
has
four territories into two states
been clearly established."
By whom, we may ask? By Bev
eridge, whose report was the most
dishonestly framed document ever
presented to congress. By the argu
ments of Beveridge, whose remarks
on the omnibus bill and the Hamilton
bill were characterized by rancor and
bitterness toward the territories.
All of the. many recommendations,
save this one, of the president's un
usually voluminous message, are fol
lowed by reasons more or less prolix,
for their making. But no reason is
assigned this one except "Nothing
has taken up more time in congress
during the past few years than the
question as to the statehood to be
granted to the four territories."
The reasoning of Mr. Roosevelt is
lacking in that enforced justice of
the unjust judge, who righted the
wrongs of the importunate widow:
Yet because this widow tmubleth
me, I will avenge her, lest by her
continual cominsr she wearv me."
President Roosevelt wearied by the
importunate appeal of Arizona for
the rights of statehood nronosps to
prevent a repetition of that appeal
for all time by the consignment of
the territory to perpetual servitude
and by blasting the hopes forever of
those who for a generation have
ooked hopefully forward to inde
pendent statehood.
There are no obligations on us,"
says Mr. Roosevelt in regard to anv
claims which" the rights of the terri
tories may have upon the. respect of
himself and the congress. That is
true, there are no binding constitu
tional obligations but there Í3 a cer
tain morality which the president,
habitual moralizer as he is, has quite
overlooked. Since his incumbency
he has with a frequency amounting
to a habit, been engaging in duties
whose performace was not forced
upon him by any legal obligation and
in none of them have right and jus
tice been more deeply involved than
in that neglected duty of saving this
territory from the ruin of jointure or
of at least in keeping his hand off.
We have been authoritatively in
formed that the president has had
no deep intense interest of the mat
ter but that before he knew as much
of the question as he afterwards
learned, he had promised Senator
Beveridge his support in the coming
struggle, and that he admitted that
but for that promise he would keep
silent. Here is a presentation of
weakness wholly out of keeping with
the popular conception of President
Roosevelt. The president has never
entertained a sincere friendship for
the west. He has patted it on the back
and led it into confounding patron
izing familiarity with friendly inter
est. The mental attitude of Mr.
Roosevelt toward the population of
the west is hardly less contemptuous
than that of former President Cleve
land and is well illustrated by the
following extract from a recent let
ter by Mr. W. E. Curtis:
"Arizona is the range of the Rough
Rider and the people of the territory
are complaining that they are 'rough
ridden.' Going into the president's
office one day last winter, I found
Major Llewellyn of the first volun
teers, seated on a sofa. When I ask
ed what he was doing in Washington
he explained that he had come to ar
range an escort of Rough Riders for
the president on inaugural day.
"Are you going to haye all the
regiment here?" I asked.
"The president who stood five or
six feet awy, talking with another
caller, must have overheard our re
marks, for he turned and, showing
his teeth, whispered:
" 'All who are not in office or in
jail."
There is nothing to be expected
from an appeal to President Roose
velt's sense of justice in this matter.
The whole reliance of Arizona must
be placed upon congress. The battle
is by no means lost. President
Roosevelt's recommendations have
been frequently ignored. We trust
that this one will be disregarded.
