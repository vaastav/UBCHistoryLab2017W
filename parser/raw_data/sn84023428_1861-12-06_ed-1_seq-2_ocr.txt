Burlington, and it is not known when
they will leave. It is thought by some
that they will spend the winter there.
The measles have been in camp, and near-
y all who have not previously had them,
were attacked. We hear of but one death
Austin A. Harris, of Vernon, a member
of Co. F. He died from congestion of
the lungs following meascls. His remains
were conveyed to the Rutland cars ucxt
morning for conveyance to his home,
eight of his comrades acting as pall bear

and a few remarks made by Chaplain
Woodward.
Capt. Sawyer, quite unexpectedly
came home on Monday, as also Thomas
Wiswall, one of the Captain's company,
who has been sick with the measles.
SiT AH the news we get from Fort

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
We received the President's Message
too late to give it entire. We therefore
give an abstract, embracing its most im
portant features. The President says s
."In the midst of unprecedented polit
ical troubles, we have cause of great grat
itude to God for unusual good health aud
most abundant harvests.
You will not be surprised to learn that,
in the peculiar exigencies of the times,
our intercourse with, foreign nations has
been attended with uncommon solicitude,
chiefly turning upon our domcstio affairs.
It is not my purposo to review our dis
cussion with foreign States, because, what
ever might be their wishes and disposi
tions, the integrity of our country aud
the ability of our government mainly de
pend, not upon them, but on the loyalty,
virtue, patriotism and intelligence of the
American people The correspondence it
self, with the usual reservations, is here
with submitted. I venture to hope it will
appear that we have practised prudence
and liberality towards foreign powers
averting causes of irritation, and with
firmness maintaining our own rights and
honor.
If any good reason exists why we should
persevere longer in withholding our re
cognition of the independence and sove
reignty of Hayti and Liberia, I am una
blc to discern it. Unwilling, however, to
inaugurate a novel policy in regard to
them without the approbation of Congress,
I submit for your consideration the expe
diency of an appropriation for maintaining
a charge d'affaires near each of these new
states. It docs not admit of doubt, that
important commercial advantages might
be secured by favorable treaties with tncm.
The message also calls attention to the
defenses on our sea coast, lakes and rivers,
as of great importance at this time.
After reccommendiug Congress to pro
vide for the construction of a rail-road as
a military necessity, from Western N. C.
and East Tcnn. to the loyal parts of Ken
tucky, tho Finances of the country arc
thus presented :
The operations of the treasury during
the period which has elapsed since your
adjournment have been conducted with
signal success. The patriotism of the
people has placed at the disposal of the
government the large means demanded by
the public exigencies. Much of the na
tional loan has been taken by citizens of
the industrial classes, whose confidence in
their country's faith and zeal for their
country.s dclivercuce from its present peril
have induced them to contribute to the
support of the government the whole of
their limited acquisitions. This fact ira.
poses peculiar obligations to economy in
disbursment and energy in action.
lhc revcuuofrom alt sources, including
loans, for the financial year ending on
tho 30th of June, 18GI, was $36,835,900
27, and the expenditures for the same per
iod, including payments on account of the
publio debt were $34,578,034 47, leaving
a balance in the Treasury, on the 1st of
July of $2,257,065 80. For the first
quarter of the financial year ending on
the 30th of Sept., 1861, the receipts
from all sources, including the balance of
July 1st. were $102,532,500 27, and the
expenses $98,239,733 09, leaving a bal
ance on the 1st of October, 1861, of $1,-
292, 776 18.
It is gratifying to know that tho cxpen-
scs made necessary by the rebellion are
not beyond the resources of the loyal peo
ple, and to believe that the same patriot
ism which has thus far sustained the
government, will continue to sustain it till
peace and union shall again bless the
land.
I respectfully refer to tho report of the
secretary of war for information respec
ting the numerical strength of tho army,
and for recommendations having in view
an increase of its efficiency and the well-
being of the various branches of tho ser
vice entrusted to his care. It is gratify
ing to know that the patriotism of the
people has proved equal to the occasion,
and that the number of troops tendered
greatly exceeds the force which Congress
authorized me to call into the field. I re
fer with pleasure to those portions of his
report which make allusion to the credi
table degree of discipline already attained
by our troops, and to the excellent sani
tary condition of the entire army.
The report of the secretary of the navy
presents in detail the operations of that
branch of tho service, the activity and
energy which have characterized its ad
miuistation and the results of measures
to increase its efficiency and power. Such
have been tho additions by construction

making $3,683,00, to which should be

turcs for 1862 arecstimatcd at $12,528,-
000. leaving an estimated donciency of
$3,145,000, to be supplied from the tresu
ry in addition to the permanent appropria
tion. ,
The war has greatly affected the depart
ment of the Interior, including the Land
Offices, Patent Office and Pension Bureau.
The cash receipts from the sale of pub
lio lands during the past year have ex
ceeded the expenses of our land system
ouly about two hundred thousand dollars.
The receipts of the Patent Office have de
clined in nine months about $100,000,
rendering a large reductiou of tho force
employed necessary to make it self-sustaining.
The demands upon the pension of
fice will be largely increased by the insur
rection. Numerous applications for pen
sions based upon the casualties of the ex
isting wur, have already been made
There is reason to beleivo that many who
are now upon the pension roll, and in re
ceipt of the bouuty of the government,
arc in tho ranks of the insurgent army,
or giving them aid and comfort. The sec
retary of the interior directed a suspension
of payment of the pension of such persons
upon proof of their disloyalty. 1 recom
mend that Congress authorize that officer
to causo the names of such persons to be
stricken from the pension roll.
The relations of the government with
the Indian tribes have been greatly dis
turbed by the insurrection, especially in
the southern superintendency and in New
Mexico. It is believed that upon the re
possession of the country by the federal
forces, the Iudians will readily cease all
hostile demonstrations, and resume their
former relations to the government."
An Agricultural Bureau is recommend
ed. The suppression of tho slave trade
has been prosecuted with vigor. Five
vessels being fitted out for the slave trade
have been condemned, two mates of slav
crs fined and imprisoned, and one captain
of a slaver taken with a cargo of Affri-
cans, has been condemned to death.
" The territories of Colorado, Dakotah
and Nevada, created by the last Congress
have been organized and civil administra
iion inaugurated therein. So far the ou
thority of tho United States has been up
held in the territories, as it is hoped it
will be in the future. I commend their
interests and defense to the enlightened
and generous care of Congress."
Under and by virtue of tho act of
Congress entitled an act to confiscate
property used for insurrectionary purposes,
approved Aug. 6th, 1861, the legal claims,
of certain persons to the labor and service
of certain other persons, have become for
feited and numbers of tho latter thus lib
erated are already dependent on the Uni
ted States and must be provided for in
some way.
The direct relation of slavery to the
war tho President leaves for Congress to
fix. Ho however goes aud for, recommends
Congress to provido for colonizing fugi
tive, contraband, aud confiscated negroes.
The mammoth scheme is thus referred to:
If it be said that the only legitimate
object of acquiring territory is to furnish
homes for white men, this measure effects
that object, for the emigration of colored
men leaves additional room for whito men
remaining or coming here. Mr. Jefferson,
however, placed the importance of procur
ing Louisiana more on political and com
mercial grounds than providing room for
population. On this whole proposition,
including tho appropriation of money for
tho aquisition of territory, docs not the
expediency amount to absolute necessity
that without which the govcrumcut cannot
bo perpetuated if the war continues.
In considering tho policy to bo adopted
for tho suppression the insurrection, I
have been careful and anxious that the
inevitable conflict for this purposo shall
not degrade into a yiolcut and remorseless
rcrolutionary struggle. I have therefore.
in every case thought it proper to keep tho
integrity of the Union prominent as tho
firimary object of the contest on our part,
caving all questions which are not of
vjtaj military importance, to, the more
deliberate action of the Legislature.
Groat progress js being made in crush

with the retirement of Gen. Scott came
the executive duty of appointing in his
ccnoral-in-chicf of tho army. ; It
j8 a fortunate circumstance that neither in
council nor country was there, so far as I
know. any difference of opinion as to the
proper person to be selected. The retir
ing chief repeatedly expressed his judg
ment in favor of Gen. McClcllan for the
position, and in this the nation seemed to
give a unaminous concurrence."
After referring to the dangerous theory
of the southern oligarchy, that capital
owns labor, as tending to monarchy and
despotism, and showing by fair reasoning
that labor produces and creates capital,
he closes the message by a glimpse at the
future.
From the first taking of our national
census to the last, are seventy years, and
we find our population at tho end of the
period eight times as great as it was at
the begining. The increase of those other
things which men deem desirable, has
been even greater. We thus have at one
view, what the popular principle applied
to government, through the machinery of
the states and the Union, has produced
in a given time, and also what if firmly
maintained, it promises for the future.
There arc already among us thoso who, if
tho Lnioti be preserved, will live to see it
contain 250,000,000 people. The strug
gle of to-day is not altogether for to-day.
It is for a vast future also.
With a firm reliance in Providence, all
the more firm and earnest, let us proceed
in the great task which events have de
volved upon us.
(Signed) Abraham Lincoln,
Ylgorom Treatment ( Rebel Captains.
v hen General ebb, our minister to
Brazil, arrived at Rio, the New York
World informs us, there were forty-seven
American vessels in port(prcviously there
had been sevcuty-two) ; some of these were
commanded by secession captains, who
openly displayed from the fore, and ev
ery where except the peak, the rebel flag.
Our Consul remonstrated, but they called
the flags " signal," and claimed to display
any signals they pleased. Minister Webb
brought tho matter to an issue by in
structing the consuls at that port and the
eight other ports under his jurisdiction,
to give notice to all concerned, on their
arrival, that, on the display of a rebel
flag from any part of an American ship,
the master would be instantly removed
and the vessel be placed under the com
mand of the first or some other suitable
person, and be sent home to her owners ;
that she will be treated in all respects as
if retaken from her captors, her voyage
bo considered as terminated, and sent
home, as the readiest way of restoring to
loyal American citizens their property
recaptured from the rebels who may have
had possession of her! This vigorous
and determined policy checked tho evil at
once in Rio, and frightened tho rebel
masters out of their demonstrations.
O Mason and Slidcll, the captured
embassadors do not occupy very enviablo
positions just at present. Resolutions
were introduced into the House on Mon
day, and unanimously adopted, recom
mending the President to put them in
close confinement and treat them in all
respects like fel ons, till Col. Corcoran and
Col. Wood are released from their dun
gcons, and treated like prisoners of war,
It seems almost audacious to think of
confining F..F. Vs. like common criminals,
but wo owe it in justice to our bravo offi.
cers, that some means be taken to release
them from their prisons, and in no way
can this release be effected so readily as
by relation, which is always considered
justifiable in war. Mason and Slidell
would not serve their country of their
own accord, but now is an excellent oppor
tunity to put them to a patriotic use,
whether they are willing or not Spring.

Both Houses of Congress assembled it .
noon on Monday, and were opened with f
the customary formalities. The Presi- ,
dent's Message was not ready for delivery
and the Senate adjourned after a brief
session, while the House passed the after,
noon by listening to various resolutions,
most of which were hr relation to con-
fisticating tho slaves as well as the other
property of the rebels." Jt is early in the
day to introduce the Blavcry question, but
it shows the feeling on the subject, and
it is evident the slavery issue is not going
to be coughed down or kept out of sight.
Mr Elliot of Massachusetts offered tht
following resslution :
Jiesolved, by the House of Rcprcscnta
tatives of the United States :
1st That in behalf of the people of
the these States we do again solemn
ly declaro that tho war in which
we are now engaged, against the insur
gent bodies now in arms against the gov
crnmcnt, has for its object the suppression
of such rebellion and the re-establishment
of the rightful authority of the natioi.al
Constitution and laws over the entire ex
tent of our common country.
2nd. That while we disclaim all pow
er under tho Constitution to interfere, by
ordinary legislation, with the institutions
of the several States, yet the war now ex.
isting roust be conducted according to the
usages and rights of military service, and
that during its continuance the recognized
authority of the maxim that " the safety
of the State is the highest law ;" subor
dinates the right of property, and dom
inates over civil relations.
3rd. That, therefore we do hereby de
clare, in our judgement, the President of
the United States, as commander-in-chief
of our army, and the officers in command
under him, have tho right to emancipate
all persons held as slaves in any military
district in a state of insurrection agaiust
tho national government ; and that we
respectfully advise that such order of em
ancipation be issued whenever the same
will avail to weaken the power of the reb
els in arms, or to strengthen tho military
power of the loyal forces.
Mr. Dunn of Indiana moved to lay the
resolutions on the table, but the motion
was disagreed to by yeas 57 ; nays 70.
Tho question recurring on Mr. Elliot's
resolution, Mr. Roscoe Conkling. of New
York, proposed an amendment, which Mr.
Elliot accepted, so as to make the resolu
tion apply to the slaves of disloyal citi
zens. On motion of Mr. Stevens, of Pennsyl
vania, the further consideration of the
resolution was postponed until Tuesday
week, in order that it may be discussed
and amendments submitted. Ho was in
favor of the main features of tho propos
ition, but desired some modification.
Mr. Campbell of Penn. gave notice that
he would call up the following on Tues
day week ;
Jietolved, That in legislating to meet
the exigencies of the present rebellion.
Congross should confiscate tho property,
slaves included, of all rebels, and protect
the rights and property, under the Con
stitution and laws, of all loyal citizens.
Mr. Stevens of Pennsylvania submitted
the following for future consideration :
VnEnBA9, Slavery has caused tho present
rebellion in the United Statos; and
whereas, there can bo no solid and per
manent peace and union in this Re
public so long as that institution exists
within it ; and whereas, Slaves are now
used by the rebels as an essential means
of supporting and protracting the war ;
and whereas, by the law of nations it
is right to liborato the slave of an cuts
my to woaken his powor, therefore, ho
it
Jiesolved by the Senate and Jlovte of
Representatives of the Untied States, That
the President bo requeued to doclaro fr
and to direct all our gcnorals and officers
in command to order freedom to all slaves
who shall leave their masters, and shall
compensate all thoso who remain in supi
porting tho Union for all tho losses they
may sustain by virtue of this resolution,
or shall aid in quelling the rebellion.
2d. And be it further resolved, That
the U. S, pledge tho faith of tho nation
to make full and fair compensation to all
loyal citizens who are and shall remain
active in supporting tho Union, for all los,
scs they may sustain by . virtue of thil
resolution.
