Washington, D. C, Dec. 2 "Whack,
whack, tlni:npt)ty-thumi."
",Hut-a-tut-tat."
Willi those navel strokes tcniay, re
apecUvely, in the house and senate,
exactly aa the bronze cloks pointed
to 12, the third session of the sixty
Beconil congreHs was convened. The
people's Hurvants were at work nxain.
From the crack of the respective
gavela, congreBs aettled Into the traces
of !i;iglative buslneHs, to end only 011
March 4, when a new president and a
Democratic congress step in.
History-old scenes were repeated to
day at the openlnii of both houses. An-
) cic nt precedents, almost law from hal-
hiv.cd observance, were rigorously fol
lowed. In the senate, Senator Augustus O.
Hueon, large, florid and the personifi
cation of "senatorial dignity," did the
honors. His was the hand which light
ly ;tapped the mable-topped desk of the
presiding officer.
Speaker Champ Clark, with vigor
ous and resounding tnumps or 111s
gavel, did similar duty at the south
einl of the capltol.
n botu chambers, death lent a som
ber touch to the opening ceremonies.
The senate mourned in Its bereave
ment of Vice President Sherman and
foihner Senator Heyburn of Idaho, both
of , whom died during the recess since
lust August.
In the house, a half dozen mahogany
desks, covered with flowers and drap
ed with crepe, brought a tear to the
eyfc of many returning members.
Out of respect to their deceased
members both boupoa adjourned with
in ja few minutes a'tcr convening,
after transacting minor and necessary
initial business. . ,
genator Hoot of New York In a feel
ing eulogy, of fir tally announced U the
senate the death of Vice President
Sherman, in whose absence the presi
dent pro tempore of the senate. Sena
tor Bacon, acted as presiding officer.
Senator Borah of Idaho followed the
New York senator with the announce
ment of the death of his former col
league. Senator Heyburn. Resolu
tions were thsn passed expressing the
jleep sorrow of the senate, and sym
pathy for the bereaved families. The
senate then adjourned until Tuesday.
Similar recognition of their dead was
made in the house.
"The house will be In order," were
Speaker Clark's salutatory remarks,
with a wldi smilf! for the BUeaker. A
roil call was then ordered, to ascer
tain if a quorum of the house was
piesent.
Appointment of committees In no
tit the senate and President Tal't that
the house was in sesslou again and
ready to do business, with a faint hint
to the president that the limse was
re;ny to receive any meFspi;e or leirls-
bitive suggestions from him, was then
the final business before the house
adjourned until noon Tuesday.
Ponderous machinery of the senate

program of the senate did not include
'appointment of the notification com
Imiitees until tomorrow. Fixing of an

j b:- most senators, until1 ate in the

I Despite the formal, perfunctory pro
ieeedings today, spectators stormed
'the'capitol to witness the Inaugura
tion of the concluding session of this
congress. The galleries, public and
private, in both chambers, were, jam
med. A sea of feminine finery, with
fluttering fans and waving .plumes,
made a riot uf color and softened the
more harsh tone of the routine busi
ness proceedings.

floral baskets filled the desks of many
representatives. In the senate', a few
boutonierres, worn in senatorial laps,
were the only things of color. The
senate lias tabooed flowers at opening
si f-sions for several years, passing 1111
iron clad order against any such open
ing demonstrations or attentions from
friends, relatives or office seekers.
StrlTo of recent battles 011 political
campaign fields lent both a humorous
and a tragic angle to today's biief ses
sion. Many war scarred veterans of
a generation of campaigns looked upon
the opening gayety for the last time.
They were the ones defeated last,
month In the Democratic landslide.
Despite their political misfortune:1.,
the ".lame ducks" laughed and joked
across the aisles to their victorious op
ponen ft. This aftermath of the re
cent election w-as more evident In the
house than in the senate.
Democrats and Republicans mixed In
little knots and around desks of lead
ers in the house, slapping each other
01. the back and telling their sad or
joyful talcs of defeat or re-election.
Cordial handshaking was about the
limit of outward display of exuberance
in the senate.
Congratulations were showered upon
the fortunate members re-elected.
