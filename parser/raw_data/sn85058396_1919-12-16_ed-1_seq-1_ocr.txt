by United State? District Judge A. B.
Anderson until such a date as it is
deemed advisable to bring the cases
again before the court The exception
is the charge against Alexander
Howat, president of the Kansas dis

charged with continued violation of
the court's Injunction against further

Attorneys tor Howat who is uudr

has been instrumental in ending the
strike In the Kansas region insofar as
it affected men called out on Oetober

men who were on a local strike prior
to the general strike.
I The motion for continuance of the
Charges of contempt was made by
Henry Warrum general eounsel for
the 1 nited Mine Workers and was con
curred in b the government. The at
torneys took the position that re
sumption of operation and return to
wock of miners in compliance with the
agreement reached here last week
constituted compliance with the
court's order for ending the strike.
Judge Anderson said he was unwilling
to continue the cases indefinitely and
indicated that they probably would be

went on local strikes. In this case, it j
was stated, members of some of the !

CHICAGO, Dec. 16. Four thousand
of Chicago's 5.000 saloons will close
their doors or go into other business
on January 1, according to an estimate
today by M. J. McCarthy, secretary of

association. "We really expected to
see the saloons open up after the su
preme court action," he said, "and the
decision upholding war time prohibi
tion took the pep out of the owners "
1 The statement of Levy Mayer, chief
i counsel for the liquor interests of the
I middle west, that "the real fiyht had
i not begun," brought some cheer to Ihe
saloon owners and distiller;, heads.
"This decision is just a scratch on
I the surface," he said. "The constitu

Itlon amendment, will be attacked In B

MEXICO CITY. Monday, Dec ?
(By the Associated Press.) The
United States-Mexican international
situation has 0 parable in the fable of
the wolf and the shoep in which the
wolf at the head of the stream accuser
the sheep below him of muddying the
water, according 10 a statement Issued
tonight, by Luis Cabrera, secretary of
the treasury and government spokes
( man.
An emphatic deni il Is made by
jSenor Cabrera of charges contained in
1 new.naner disnatehes rccened in Mex
ico City that he Is favoring the British
1 at the expense of American interests.
Branding charges of ami Americanism
made by "the interventionist press" as
1 part of an International political
scheme, Senor Cabrera declares them
utterly false.
j The statement makes specific men
tion of charges of favoritism to the
I British with regard to the return of the
railways to their owners, oil conces
sions and cotton shipments; the pro
posed visit of Rafael Nieto. sub-secre
tary to the minister of finance, to Lon
don; the visit to Mexico of Major How
ard and Brigadier General Alfred C
Crltchley of the Canadian air forces
and their conferences with Norman
King, the British consul-general at
Mexico, together with an Intimation
I which Senor Cahrera declares to be
false that an attempt is being made
to secure British support in the con
troversy with the I'nited States over
the killing and kidnaping of American
citizens.
Mexico Misinterpreted.
The interventionist press, according
to Senor Cahrera, misinterprets Mexi
co's resumption of relations with the
i European nations He declares ih u
during the war Mexico's International
relations of necessity were concerned
mainly with the United States but af
ter the conclusion of peace a resump
tion of relations with other powers
was a natural procedure, which should
be regarded hu an inspiration for con
fidence in the I'nited States Instead
lot B subject for unfounded conjectures
jthat an anti-American motive inspires
the move.

The general opinion e-xpn ssed in

of ihe United States in the Austrian
