THE PRESlBENT SIDE STEPS IM
PORTANT SUBJECTS.
,• Trust legislation, the regulation ot
"failways and the conservation ©{"na
tional resources are the three most
Important questions now in the spot
light before the American public, and
the president's message is silent a*
to each of them. It does not fol
low from this that these subjects
were not fully treated ill the first
JtlrnughtW the message. They prob
1\. ":ably were, but when the message was
^".'submitted to tlie^cabinet officers,
wlio are the presidepVs advisers, they
did not agree with his-views on
these subjects, and to avoid rupture
or difference of opinion in the Pres
ident's official family, Taft cut them
out entirely, promising to submit a
1-, special message In refreence there
to at some future time. By pursuing
tl^is course the President has an op
portunity to line up his cabinet to
his way of thinking, or surrender to
the views of his advisers who have
differed1 with him.
Mr. T-aft |B at thfe parting of the
ways. While naturally inclined to
follow ^he lines of least resistance,
there is no ieast reslstence road on
any of these subjects. Which shall
have precedence, human rights or
property rights? Shall mankind or
money be'given a first place? Pres
ident' Taft must line up on one side
or the other. If he gets down on
V. the property side of the fence there
will be a loud demand for Roosevelt
in 1912. If he' offends predatory
wealth his nomination in 1912 may
he an empty honor. No wonder Taft
hesitates.
MAC VEAGH TRACES THEFTS IN
NEW YORK CUSTOM HOUSE
TO POLtTICAL CONTRI­
BUTIONS.
Secretary of the Treasury Mac
Veagh, in his Annual report makes it
quite cleair, that the gigantic .thefts
in the New York custom house are
closely connected and largely due to
the relations which exist between the
customs service and certain political
organizations in the state of New
York. Here- is -a paragraph from Sec
retary Mac Veagh's report:
"Unless the customs service can
be released from the payment of po
litical debts and exactions, and from
meeting the supposed exigencies ot
t/
political organizations, big and little,
It will be Impossible to have an hon
est service for any length of time.".
For the past eight years James S.
Clarkson, commonly called ''Ret"
Clarkson, has been surveyor ot the
Port of New York. air. Clarkson was
for many years the editor of the
Des Moines Register and a political
boss in this state and, while a rad
ical partisan, he unduobtedly would
have done more than lje did do to
prevent the looting of the govern
ment were it not for the fact that hel
owe3 his position to a political orga
nization in the State of New York,
an organization largely financed by
the men who were robbing the gov
ernment in their dealings at the New
York Custom House.
This demoralization of politics and
the public service is due to tKe se
cret campaign contributions.
How much longer will the party in
power stand sponsor for this 'nefa
rious practice?
How inuch-longer will self respect
ing men continue to cast their vote!
for candidates, "who refuse to vote
for a law which will break up thle
degrading business?
The President is. now searching for
a man to succeed Mr. Clarkson, but
it is quite safe to say even after all
fhat Secretary Mac Veagh has made
public that the President will not
attempt to make an appointment that
Is not recommended or approved by
the republican state committee of the
State of New York.
.HOME RULE FOR IRELAND.
Mr. Asquith, who Is the leader of
the liberal "party in Great Britain,
has committed his party to a policy
which will give local self government
to the people of Ireland, In the
event of a liberal victory at the elec
tion which will take place next
month.
In a recent speech Mr. Asquith
said:
"Speaking last year, before my ac
cession to the premiership, I describ
ed the Irish policy as the one undeni
able failure of British steatesman
ship. I repeat tonight what 1 said
then, and on'behalf of my colleagues
and, I believe, on behalf of my par
ty, I reiterate 'that this is a prob
lem to" bo solved only in" one way—
by a policy which, while explicitly
safeguarding the supreme, indivis
ible authority of the imperial parlia
ment, oan set up in Ireland a sys
tem of full self government as re
gards purely, Irish affairs."

TAFT KNOCKS ON SECRET CAM-,
PAIGN CONTIRBUTION|.
The following paragraph appears in
the President's recent. message to
Congress:
I urgently recommend to congress
that a law. be passed requiring £Ki
candidates in elections^ of members of
the house of representatives and com
mittees in charge of their candidacy
and campaign file in a proper office
of the United States government a
statement of the contributions re
ceived and of the expenditures in
curred in the campaign, for such elec
tions and .that similar legislation be
enacted in respect to/all other-elec
tions which are constitutionally with
in the control of congress.
While the President's recommend.
Is phrased in gentle -words it covers
the whole ground, with one exception.
\The contributions should he made,
public before the election instead ot
thereafter. If law breaking individ
uals and law defying trusts contrib
ute large sums to aid in the-flection,
of certain candidates, the .' people
sv
should be appraised ot that fact
before they "Vote and not afterwards
After the public robbers have elect
ed their congressman the publlca
tion of how they did It will not help
the public much more than-^ 'helped
the man who locked his .hU'h dooi'
after .his horse was stolen....
