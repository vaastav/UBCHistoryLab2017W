v "In any large body of men, however,
there are certain to ba aome who are
dishonest, and If the condlttono are
auoh that th.e. men prosper or com
mlt their misdeed, with Impunity, their
example le a very evil thing for the
community. Where theae men are buel
aieaa men of (rest sagacity and of tem
perament both unscrupulous and reok
leaa, and where the conditions are such
that they aot without eupervlelon or
control and at first without effective
cheek from public opinion, they delude
many Innocent people Into making- In
vestments or embarking- In kinds of
buelneee that are really unsound.
When the misdeeds of these successful
ly dishonest men are discovered, suf

jupon the Innocent men whom they

are apt to forget that the longer it was

th. legislation or tne congress and fhe
administration of the law 'by the de-'
partment of justice. The moat vital
need Is In connection with the rallrosda.
As to these, In my Judgment there
should now be either a national incor
poration act or a law licensing railway
companies to engage In interstate eom
meree upon certain conditions, The law
should be so framed as to give to the
interstate commerce commission power
to pass upon the future Issue of securi
ties, while ample means should be pro
vided to enable the commission, when
ever In Its Judgment it is necessary, to
make a phyalcal valuation of any. rail
road. As I stated In my message to the
congress a year ago, rallroada ahould
be given power to enter Into agree
ments, subject to these agreementa be
ing made publlo la minute detail and ta
the consent of the Interstate commerce
commission being llrst obtained. Until
the national government assumes
proper oontrol of Interstate eommeree,
la the exercise of the authority It al
ready posseieea. it will ba Impossible
either to give to or to get from the
railroads full Justice. The raliroaas
and all other great corporations will
do well to recognise that this oontrol
must come; the only queation la aa to
what governmental body can most
wisely exerclss it Ths oourts will de
termine the limits within which the
federal authority can exercise it. and
there will etill remain ample work
within each state for the railway com
mission of that atate; and the national
interstats oommerce commission wilt
work In harmony with the several state
commissions, eaoh within Its own prov-
Inoe, to achieve yhe deaired end.
Control ef Interstate
Baalnese Concerae Urged.
"Moreover, in my Judgment there should
b. additional legislation looking to ths
proper control of the great business con
cerns engaged In Interstats business, this
control to be exercised for their own
benefit and prosperity no less than for
the protection of Investors and of the
general public. Aa I have repeatedly
eald in meesagee to eoagreBS and else
where, experience haa definitely shown
not merely the unwladom but the futility
of endeavoring to put a stop to all busi
ness combinations. Modern Industrial
eonditlona are ouch that combination is
not only necessary but Inevitable. It Is
so in the world of business Just aa It is
ao In the world of labor, and It la as Idle
to desire to put an end to all corpora
tiona, to all big comblnationa of capital,
aa to desire to put an end to combina
tions of labor. Corporation and labor
union alike have come to atay. Each If
properly managed la a source of good
and not evil. Whenever in either there
ie evil, it ahould be promptly held to ac
count; but It ahould receive hearty en
couragement ao long aa it la properly
managed. It la profoundly Immoral to
put or keep en the statute books a law,
nominally In the Interest of public moral
ity, that really puts a premium upon
publlo Immorality, by undertaking to
forbid honest men from doing what must
be done under modern business condi
tion., ao that the law Itself provides that
Ita own Infraction must be the oondltlon
precedent upon business success. To aim
at the accompUahment of toe much usu
ally means the accomplishment of too lit
tle, and often the doing of poeltlve dam
age. The antitrust Maw should not ba re
pealed; but It ahould be made both more
efficient and more in harmony with act
ual eonditlona. It should be so amended
ae to forbid only the kind of combination
which doee harm to the general public,
such amendment to be accompanied by,
or to be an Incident of, a grant of au
pervlaory power 10 the government over

tion of unhealthy and Improper comblna
tiona, instead of waiting until they are
In existence and then attempting to de
stroy them by civil or criminal proceed
ings. Investing Pahlle Sheald
Be Amply Safeguarded.
"The congress haa the power to oharter
corporations to engage in Interstate and
foreign commerce, and a general law can
be enacted under the provisions of which
Avlatlnur cornnratlons could take out fed
eral charters and new federal corpora-'
tlons could be created. An essential pro
vision of such a law should be a method
of predetermining by aome federal board
or commission whether the applicant for
'a federal charter waa an association or
combination within the restrictions of the
federal law. Provialon ohould aleo be
made for oomplete publicity in all matters
affecting the public and complete protec
tion to the Investing public and the share
holders in the matter of Issuing corporate
aecurltles. If an incorporation law is not
deemed advisable, a licence aet for big
Interstats corporations might be enacted;
or a combination of the two might be
tried. The aupervlslon established might
be analogous to that now exercised over
national banks. At Issst, the antitrust
act shoutd be supplemented by specific
prohibitions of the methods which ex
perience has shown have been of most
service in enebllng monopolistic combina
tions to crush out competition. The real
owners of a corporation should be com
pelled to do business In their own name
The right to hold stock In other corpora
tions should heareafter be dented to Inter
stats corporations, unless on approval by
the proper government officials, and a
prerequisite to auch approval ahould be
the listing with the government of all
owners and stockholders, both by the
corporation owning such stock and by
the corporations In which such stock is
owned.
"To confer upon the national govern
ment, in connection with the amendment
I sdvocate In the antitrust law, power of
supervision over big business ooncerns
engaged In interstate commerce, would
beneld them ss It has benefited the na
tional banks. In the recent business
crisis It is noteworthy that the Institu
tions which failed were institutions
which were not under the supervision and
control of the national government.
Those which were under national con
trol stood the teet.
"National control of the kind above ad
vocated would be to the benefit of every
well-managed railway. Prom the stand
point of ths public there Is need for ad
ditional tracks, adltlonal terminals, and

"Instances nf abos.- In the granting of
Injunctlona fn labor illsputeo continue to
occur, and the resentment In the minds
of thoss who feel that their right are
being Invade t and their liberty of action
and of speech unwarrantably restrained
continues ta grow. Muoh of ths attack
an the use of the process of Injunction Is
wholly without warrant; but I am con
stralnsd tca pra-a the belief that for
aome of It there Is warrant. Thla ques
tion Is becoming more and more of prime
Importance, and unices the court, will
themselves d at with It In effective man
ner, tt la certain ultimately to demand
some form of legtelattvt action. It would
be most unfortunate fot our eoclal wel
fare If we should permit many honest
and law-abiding eltlaens to feel that
they had Just cauae for regarding our
courta with hostility. I earneatly com
mend to the attention of the congress
this matter, so that some way may be
devleed which will limit the abuse of In
junctions and protect thoae rlghta which
from tlms to tlms tt unwarrantably in
vades. Moreover, dlccontent is often ex
pressed with ths use of the process of
Injunction by the courts, not only In la
bor disputss, but where stste laws are
concerned. I refrain from discussion of
this question as I am informed that It
will soon receive the consideration of the
supreme court."
Of other legislation In the Interest of
labor he favor, federal Inspection of rail

'Ths constitutionality of ths employers'

In two Jurladlctiona the law haa been de

dictions Its constitutionality haa been af
firmed. The queation haa been carried to
tue supreme court, th. caae has been
heard by that tribunal and a decision Is
expected at an early date In tha event
that tha court ahould affirm tha consti
tutionality of the act, I urge further leg
lalatloa along th llnee advocated In my
rocacage to tha preceding oongreca. Th.
practice of putting tha entire burden of

sveral agencies, the government has
been endeavoring to get our people to
look ahead and to substltuts a planned
and orderly development of our re
sources In place of a haphasard striv
ing for Immediate profit. Our great

In Importance, and the Columbia sec
ond, although there are many others of
Importance on the Paclflo and Atlantic
and tha gulf alopes. Tha national gov
ernment ahould undertake thle work,

In the preaent congress; and the great
est of all our rivers, the Mississippi,
should reoelvs especial attention. From
the Oreat Lakes to the mouth of the
Mississippi there should be a deep wa
terway, with deep waterwaye leading
from It to the east and the west. Such
a waterway would praotically mean
the extension of our coast lins Into ths
vsry heart of our country. It would be
of incalculable benefit to eur people. If
begun at once It can be oarrisd through

systematically and continuously oarrled

been accomplished In the great oil

striking example of the good results
of such a policy. In my Judgment ths

Pregrese ef the Work

"Work on the Panama canal 1. pro
ceeding In a highly sstlsfactory man

the Culebra Cut where effort was
chiefly concentrated, waa 111.170 cubic
yards. In April this was Increased to
I7MJ7 cubic yards. There was a con
sldsrabla decrease In the output for
May and June owing partly to the ad
vent of the rainy ssason and partly to
temporary trouble with the eteam
shovel men over the queotlon of wagee.
This troubls waa settled satisfactorily
to all partlee and In July the total ex
cavation advaneed materially and In
August th grand total from all points
In ths canal prism by steam ahsvels
and dredges sxeseded all previous
United States records, reaching 1.174,
44 cubic yard. In September this rec
ord was eclipsed and a total of 1.117.
41S cuble yarda waa removed. Of tills
amount 1,411.107 cubic yarda were from
ths canal prism and 14,104 euble yarda
wars from accessory work. These re
sult were achieved In the relay sea
son with a rainfall In Auguat of 11.10
Inchee and In September of 11 41 lachee.
Finally, la October, the record est
again eclipsed, the total excavation be

of ths heavy rainfall, which was 17.1

"I commend to the favorable oonsld
ratlon of ths oongrssa a postal aav

objeet Is to eneourage among our peo

of poatal aavlnga banks to give them
an opportunity to husband their re
aourcss, particularly thoaa who hava
not tha facllitlea at hand for depositing
thslr monsy In aavlnga banks. Viewed,
however, from the expertenoe of the
past few wesks, It la evident that the
advantagee ot auoh an institution are
till more far-reaching. Timid depos
itors hava withdrawn their aavlnga for

tha workingmen their earnlnga; all
of which money hae been withdrawn
and kept In hiding or In the sate de

restorsd to the channels of trade, t
the mutual benefit of capital and labor.
