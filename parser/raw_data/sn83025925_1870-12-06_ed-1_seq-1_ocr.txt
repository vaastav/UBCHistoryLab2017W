An article published by the Paris Figaro on
the 11th of November it reproduced in the
Afonitcur du heinf-et-Oise, which appears at
Versailles under the auspices of the Prussian
authorities. The Figaro beads its article with
the question, "Are we Lost?" and proceeds to
examine into the real position of the capital. It
says:
In a material point of view, the position of
Paris is not improving; if our intrenchments
are pushed on with activity the Prussians are
still more active. Besides, we have already
consumed a certain quantity of our provisions;
lreth meat is becoming scarce; we are about to
rely upon salt meat, and we know not, thanks
to the reticence of the Government, how long
that resource will be open to us. In a moral
point of view, our position has not improved.
Some people are completely depressed, aud are
ready to give themselves up bound hand and
foot to the Prussians, while others retain the
old self-estimation and the old belief that
Europe is locking on and admiring them.
Paris cannot be delivered of itself, as every
sensible man is convinced. In vain we are told
that the number of our garrison is equal to that
of the besiegers. Place on one Bide 100 of our
pieces of l v, and on the other 100 of Krapp's
guns. Then on either side there would be 100
cannon, but still the forces would not be equal.
We ran successfully resist the Prussian army;
we cannot hope to compel it to raise the siege.
The soldiers of the Loire themselves aud tlie
(iardes Mobiles very superior to the National
Guards are still not equal to the German troops
in niftmble and discipline. If we admit for a
moment that we can brink the line of invest
ment, do we cot know that the couutry, for a
space of thirty leagues round, has been wasted,
aud that the bloody sacrifice necessary to attain
that end will not enable us to revictual Paris for
a (ingle day?
The whole question, then, is to know whether
we have or not a rclievinir army which is ap
proaching to our aid. Without it all our efforts
will be useless. We shall, doubtless, kill many
Prussians, but the enemy will kill many French
men, and the loss of Paris will not be averted by
a single day.
We are not yet lost, but we are upon the de
clivity whjch leads to great catastrophes. If we
have written these lines it is to arrive at this
yoncliiBion. If the provinces abandon Paris,
Paris is tnrflrmia obligation uselessly to sacrifice
herself, and may without dishonor seek to treat
upon her own account.
JH011E KArOLEOXIU REVELATIONS.
Hew the French (iovermneat V Deluded
In Regard to (irruiunv'i SireoKiU.
A collection of despatches and other docu
ments found at St. Cloud, and extending from
the i!9th of June to the 28th of July, has just
been published at Berlin. They are interesting
as supplying some missing links In the history
of the war, and also as showing the way in
which the French Government was deluded by
its agents with regard to public feeling in Ger
many. As early as the 21) th of June, the Minister of
Maiinewas inquiring as to the stores of clothing
available for a campaign in the North. On the
6th oil July, the dale of the Due de Gramont's
memorable declaration, so offensive to Prussia,
Count Persigny cordially congratulated the Em
peror, remarking, "All France will follow you;
the enthusiasm is unanimous." while M. Ollivier
informed him that the declaration bad been re
reived with immense applause. "Even tLe
lx.it," be wrote, "with the exception of a very
small number, aflirmed that it would support
the Government." The excitement at the first
moment even outstripped iU goal.
On the bih of July the Government sent
orders for an intelligent man to be sent to
Knstadt to see what the Baden Custom-IIouse
officers on the Khine were doing.
On the l&tu the Prefect of Perpignan re
ported that war was ardently desired by the
whole population, even the republicans predict
ing the commencement or costumes in a week,
and that the soldiers would celebrate the Napo
leon fete (.August 15) at Berlin. "Nobody, ' he
said, "doubts the favorable issue of the' war;
there Is confidence everywhere, alike In the
towns and in the smallest villages." On that
verv day war was declared.
On the lbth the Prefect of Marseilles reported
a great torchlight demoustratiou of 1 5,000 per
sono, and cries of "A bas la Prusse!" "A Ber
lin !" the crowd being electrified.
On the 17b the Kmpress wrote to her mother,
the Countess Montijo, at Madrid: "Louis will
set out in a few days with his father for the
army. I with you to send him your blessing
belore his departure. Do not be anxious. I a in
perfectly culm. He must do his duty and honor
to his name. On the 17th the "Marseillaise,
so long forbiddeu as revolutionary, was sanc
tioned. On the 21st a despatch was sent from Metz to
the Uaulois, "Calling out of the land webr dim
cult, conscripts weep, great fear of the French
especially the of Turcs; they are carried off by
lorce in wagons.

Injured.
The burning of the Varieties Theatre has
been already reported by telegraph. The New
Orleans JOjublican of the lid iutt. had the fol
limine Darticulars:
Between four and five o'clock yesterday morn
ing persons in the vicinity of the Varieties
Theatre discovered it to be on lire, as smoke
issued from the doors and windows frosting on
the alley. In a very tew minutes alter the a is
cevery, names burst forth with great fury. Ap
parently the fire originated in the property
room, or somewbere about the stage, wnere
there was plenty of combustible material to feed
the lire.
An alarm was promptly given, but all efforts
seemed of no avail. Ihe Bremen labored man
fully and unceasiogiy, but water appeared to
have litlle effect on the burning building. The
devouring element soon destroyed the theatre,
leaving nothing but debris and skeleton walls
scarcely any property was savea.
I Members of the dramatic company are suffer

All the properties belonging to th establish
ment were lost. Scarcely a piece of fit&niture
fcttms to Lave been rescued from the clubrooia
on the ground floor, or frctn behind the scenes
above. When the firemen arrived the smoke
inside the building was so dense as to prevent
any one from entering.
The saddest portion of our record is yet to be
made. Several of No. 14's men were fighting the
fire, nnconscious and thoughtless of the great
calamity then impending over their heads. A
portion of the theatre wall fell, crushing every
thing in its way. John Connors, foreman, of
Philadelphia, was struck down by brick and
timbers and injured, but not so seriously as to
lay him up, as be was out during the day. One
of his hands is burned. Near hint stood

put them to work on the heated piles. They
soon found the body of Nicholson, which was
so charred and bruised as to be almost unreeog

on furniture, stores, fixtures, ana club-room,
$0000; insurance on wardrobe, stage fixtures,
furniture, etc., 14, 500. This amount is divided
among the varions home Insurance offices,
averaging about $3500 each. The original enRt
ot the building was between 1 75,000 and $30,000.
It Is estimated that the association 1b covered
by insurance to the amount of two-thirds of the
property destroyed.
Mr. Crickard, the lessee of the theatre, is per
haps the heaviest sufferer, as he had expended
the sum of f 7000 in recent alterations, exten
sions, and improvements of various kinds. Ue
bad also advanced to Mr. Lewis Baker, the
manager, the sum of $5500 to go abroad and to
procure his present company and inaugurate

PILLORY AND TOST.
Saturday's FloaTalnfre at New Castle.
Four men were placed In the pillory and
eight were flogged at New Castle, on Satirday,
in the presence of a crowd, many of whom ex
pressed a brutish delight at the disgraceful
spectacle, nut many more, we aje giaa to say,
turned away In disgust, denouncing the (bar
barism which makes the bad worse, and leaves
no spark of self-respect in a man's nature for
philanthropy or unristianity to appea; to.
Tho first nan placed in the pillory was a
white man named James Johnson, convicted of
a murderous assault on Edwin Francis. He stood
his hour out alone, then came Thomas Johns
and Joseph Robinson, colored, convicted of
assault with intent to kill on each other, who
stood ono hour, and they were followed by
William Willey, colored, whD also stood one
hour, he having been convicted of assault with
intent to kill on Thomas Johns. This occupied
the pillory up to 1 o clock. The new Sheriff
seems to extend his race sympathies to convicts,
and therefore did not facilitate matters by
rutting them through two at a time. Ex-
Sberiff Richardson had no such scruples, and
pilloried rvhite and black beside each other
without compunction.
Alter the pillory scene was over the whipping
commenced. All the persons had been con
victed of larceny, and they were flogged in the
following order: Lewis Finney, colored, 20
Inshes; John D. Davis, colored, HO lashes; Wil
liam Camphor, co'ored, 20 lashes; Andrew
Empsen, cslored, 20 lashes; William Lally,
colored, 10 luetics; iienry j. cniton. wnite, 20
lashes; Charles II. Lee. colored, 10 lashes;

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Opinions of the New York Pre its.
FROM Till "TRIBUNE."
We cannot doubt that General Grant's second
annual message will be read with hearty ap
proval by a great majority of his countrymen
and with interest and pride by them all. The
prominent features of his administration had
already commanded popular approbation, but
this message will still more endear the Presi
dent to the hearts of his countrymen. He is
Abraham Lincoln's lineal successor, and the
popular heart beats in unison with his aspira
tions and his etiorts.
FROM TUB "SUN."
The first thought that occurs to one after read
ing the message is that it is a poverty stricken
document. It tells us mueh that we already
knew, but leaves us in the dark on subjects
about which we would like to be Informed.
, FROM THE "TIMES."
The message transmitted yesterday by the
President to Congress is the best answer to
those who insist that the mission of the Repub
lican party is ended, or who impugn General
Grant s fitness for interpreting the wishes and
promoting the Interests of the people. The
policy set forth is at once positive and practical.
FROM THE "HERALD."
To be a good politician, statesman, or shoe
maker, you must learn the trade. But this mes
sage indicates the turning over of a new leaf by
General Grant, as the head of his party that
he has been learning the trade and it may be
that he will yet astonish his limping supporters
on bis strategy ana tactics, action and activity.
as master ot the political field. We think he
bas fairly knocked away the underpinning of
me revenue reioimers.
FROM THE "WORLD. '
General Grant's annual message is a document
which needs a good deal ot winnowing to sepa
rate the mall amount of irrain from the heap
of chert in which it W buried. The greater por
tion of It is history; but history neither new
nor well told. Three-fourths ox the message
might be retrenched without any chasm in the
public knowledge. Ihe document, a a whole,
is a heavy blue-book, without the specific
statements and detailed information which ren
der blue-books valuable.
So far as this message deviates from com
monplace and dull historical statement, it de
vlates into extra vagauce.

Answer to Prince UortachakaO'a Meeonrf
Mote.
Ixinpon, Dec. 5. The following Is the full text of
Barl Granville's answer to the second note of
Prince UortschakofT. It is addressed to Sir A.
Buchanan, British Ambassador at St. Petersburg,
and dated "Foreign Office, Nov. S3:"
Sir: The Iinsslan Ambassador has read and
given to me a copy of a despatch of Prince Gorts
ihakofr of the date of 8-sotu November. It Is not
necessary for her Majesty's Government to recar to
the Important question of International law raised
by the circular of Prince Uortschakorr, as they have
notblno- to add to the declaration on that subject
which they have already made.
Ills Excellency has been good enough to appeal to
my knowledge of facts which, his Excellenej states,
prevented that consultation and agreement with
other parties to the treaty which Russia would have
preferred. I am aware that suggestions for con
gresses to settle other European questions have
been made and not adopted. It has also been stated
tome that Intimations have been given to some of
my predecessors that in the case of certain contin
gencieswhich, however, have never occurred
such as the possession or the principalities by Aus
tria, Kussia would feel bound to question some of
the provisions ol tbe treaty of 1856.
But I am ignorant of any occasion on which Rus
siathe party most Interested has proposed in any
way to this country that a relaxation of the treaty
should be taken Into cossideration I cannot, there
fore, admit that the Imperial Government can
justify this proceeding by the failure of eil'orts which
have'never been made.
The courteous language In which Prince Gortseha-
kofrs despatcn is written, nis assurances oi toe man
ner in which he would have prelerred to open this
nuestion. and his declaration or tne strong desire
for a continuation of good relations between the two
nations as particularly important at tsis time, en-
ourare Her waiestv s uovernrneuiin me oener mat
the obstacle to such relations will be removed.
Thev observe that nis excellency describes me
declaration which has been made by Kussia as an
abrogation of a theoretical principle without imme
diate, app'ication. ii meae woruH are to oo con
strued into an announcement tnat Russia has
formed and stated her own opinion of her rights,
but has no intention oi acting in conrotmiiy witn it
without due concert with tne other powers, thev go
far to close the controversy in which the two Gov
ernments have been engaged.
Her Majesty's Government nave no objection to
accept the Invitation which has been made by Kus
sia tc a coniercnce, upon ine understanding mat u
assemble without any foregone conclusion as to Its
result. In such a case Her Majesty's Government
will be glad to consider with perfect fairness and
the respect due to a great and friendly power, any
proposals which Russia may have to make.

THE FIGHTING ON THE MARHE.
A courier here, to-night from M. M. Schercr, at
Versailles, on the night of the 3d (Saturday), brings
me details of the lighting on the SOU November
(Wednesday) aad the 2d or December (Friday).
1 ne fxencn now aoiu a line Hireiciung irom uno-
sur-Marne to Champigny, across the nsck or the
peninsula formed by the bend of tbe Marne (In front
of tbe Bois de Vincennes). At T o'clock on the
morning of the 2d the Sd and llth Prussian Army
Corps, and three brigades of tne w urtetnbergers at
tacked Brle-sur-Marne and Champigny. They cap.
tured the French positions at tne lormer place and
a part of the French posltiors at tbe latter. At 10
o'clock tbe French advanced to regain these posi
tions. A BIX HOURS' CONFLICT.
The battle raged for six hours, when the Prus
sians were finally driven out both from Brle-sur-Marne
and from Champigny. They were also re
pulsed from the positions of Villiers-sur-Marne (be
tween Brie and Champigny) and of Coneilly (a small
hill wooded and crowned with a chateau, to the
southeast of Champigny). The latter position, bow
ever, finally remained lr. the possession of the Ger
mans. THE FRENCH NORTH OF PARIS.
To the north of Paris tbe French also hold Gen
nevilliers (on the road between Colombes and Ville-neuve-la-Garenne,
in the peninsula formed by the
bend of the Seine from Argenteuil to St. Denis) and
Epnal les-St. Denis (on the north bank of the Seine,
near the same point. These positions were cap
tured from tbe Germans on the Both.
THE LOSSES OF THE GERMANS.
The losses of the Germans In the two days'
fight nig (of Wednesday and Friday) were flftiH) men.
The Saxons lost 2000 men, the Second Prussian
Army Corps !6oo, and the wurtembergers 1700. The
losses of the French are not known at Versailles.
WHAT THE GERMANS THINK.
A general officer of the German army at Versailles
said to our correspondent: "Trochu can afford to
lose six men to our three; If he goes on in this
fashion, we shall be all used up, and he will have
60,000 left."
WIDENINf THE CIRCLE.
The German line of investment on the south and
east Is now established considerably further back
from Paris thsn It was before taese engagements.
PARIS COMMUNICATING WITH TO 17 KM.
Our correspondent from Tours sends me word to
day (December 4) that the Government has des
patches from the headquarters of General d'Anrelles
de l'aladiues to tbe Sd, and from Paris to the 2d.
THE ARMT OF THE LOIRE ON FBIDAT.
On Friday (the Sd) the isth French Army Corps,
commanded by General Pulhes, and the loth, com
niaudud by General Reyan, had an engageaient
with German force, which consisted of two divi
sions of General von der Tann's Bavarian army,
tbe 1st (Munich) Division, commanded by Lteu tenant-General
btephen, and tbe Sd (Augs
burg) Division, commanded by Lieutenant
General Coont von Roppenheim, supported
bv General Albrecht von I tul berg's Prussian cavalry
division aud General von Wlttlch's S3d
Prussian Infantry Division. 'Uke battle lasted all

With extraordinary courage and great skill. At
nightfall the 15tb Corps held Artenay, and the 16th
Corps positions extending northward along the line
of the Paris and Orleans railway to Baaoches.
THE ARMY OF PARIS UP TO FBIDAT.
The despatch received from Paris states that the
advantages gained by General Vlnoy aud General
Duei-ut are highly Important. On the S9th (Tues
day) General V inoy, with two divisions of the 84
Army Corps,' was perfectly successful In cutting
his way south from Paris as far as Rangis (a
village six wiles south of Paris, where are the
fountain-heads of the water 'of the aqueduct of
Arcueil). He only retired again In ord.-r to allow
General Ducrot to overcome the obstacles retarding
tus further advance (the sudden rise of the river
Marne, already telegraphed). Tbe light on the Sd
was really a defeat of the Germans, General Ducrot
mslauining his positions on the left fessk of the
Jdarae.
THE flKfttf ANS AGS FOR A TO PCI.

Special Dpteh to Tit JtMnino Tt'tgrmpK
Washington, Dec. C The Republican Sena
tors held a caucus this morning, for the purpose
of appointing a committee, to revise the 8snate
committees, and prepare the order of business.
It was expected that some oblection would be
made to Senator Schurz coming into the caucas,
but he wae received as cordially as any other
Senator.
After general conversation about the business
of tbe session a resolution was offered to appoint
a committee of five to prepare a list of commit
tees for the session. The attendance, however,
was so meagre, and so much time was consumed
in general discussion that nothing was done and
the caucus adjourned to meet at the call of the
chairman, which It Sb thought will be to-morrow
or next day.
The Committee of Ways and Means-
had their fisrt session to-day. The report of
the Secretary of the Treasury, which was re
ferred to them yesterday, came up for consider
ation. The various recommendations therein
contained were discussed at some length, but
so definite action was taken. It seems doubt
ful whether a majority of the committee will
agree to tbe bill providing for tho issue of three
hundred million more five per cent, bonds, as
recommended by the Secretary, in place of the
four aud four and a half, per cents., and making
tbe lntejest payable yearly instead of semi-annually.

rlor and to Bayfield came up as the regular order of
business in the morning hour. It extends the term
of the grant for seven years from May, 1869, pro
vided that thirty roues ne completed wiinm eiirn
teen months and thirty miles every year there
after.
Tbe bill was explained and advocated by Mr. Wil
son, of Minnctota.
The bul was further explained and advocated by
Mr. Washburn, of Illinois, who stated in reply to
Questions ny Mr. w el xer, tnat tne lenirtn or tne road
originally was 800 mils, that nearly 1W0 miles are
already completed and in running order, that the
remainder was under contract, and that the quantity
of land required win ue aooui l.ooo.oou acres.
Mr. Wood (N. Y.) opposed tbe bill, declaring It
to ne out a continuation oi vue i winauns; system oy
which tbe publio lands have been given away to
private corporators. The pretended renewal was
slHinly an entirely new srant, the original grant
navinar oeen lorieitea oy non-action.
Mr. Ela(N. H.) desired to oner an amendment
making a land crant for railroads In New Hamp
shire, but Mr.-Wilson, of Minnesota, who bad charge
or tne oui. aeennea to aamit n.
Mr. Julian (Ind.) desired to have the bill amended
so as to exclude the timbered land from the rraut.
Mr. Lawrence (Ohio) also desired to have the coal
and Iron lamia excluded from the grant, and to
require the railroad company to sell tbe land to
actual settlers only and in quantities not exceeding
a quarter se-uon at not exceeuinsr t du uu acre.
Mr. Van Wyek, (N. Y.,) argued that as to MS miles
of the railroad contemplated by the bill, It was a
new srant. not the renewal of an old one.
Mr. Wilson denied that It was so to the extent of
more than 'it miles.
In reply to Mr. Wood, be argued that as it was
now admitted that tbe public lands should so to the
actual settlers. Congress should adept that policy
wblcb would prove most advantageous to tbe set
tlers, and that was tbe opening up of communication

Washington, Dec. 8.
The Appropriation Committee
held a session to-day and resolved to commence
work at once, in order to get the appropriation
bills throagh. There is a disposition to cut
down the appropriations below the estimates in
the same proportion as last year The Demo
crats expect to make some capital out of the
fact that the estimates are larger this year than
last, but it will be shown that this is owing to
the fact that there are no unexpended balances
to fall back on.
The Letter of Admiral Porter
to the President, which appears to-day, is
generally regarded very weak. Porter's friends
regret that he either wrote such a letter or
allowed it to be made public. The effect of this
correspondence will injure bis confirmation as
admiral, and may result in defeating him.

Touonto. Ontario. Dec. . The papers this morn
ing, commenting on the President s message, say la
reference to the enforcement of Canadian rights In
tlieOulf of fit. Lawrence that the President does
not found bis obiactlons against the action or our
Uovernment upon the seizure of vaasel actually en-
gaffed in fishing within roroieuen Douaaaries, out en
seiesrssand examinations of vessels suspected of
deslgas to violate the regulations ef the Canadian
Uovornmcat.
lie states that while the csnsdisn act permits or
such seizures snd examinations, the law baa not yet
been pat In force, and he is rasolvea to poatpeue
action until actual offense bas been given. Whstuer
such seizures and examinations forsi a necessary
part of tbs police duty of oar navy is a question for
tbe Uovernmant to consider.
We need hardly Bay, however, that If these pro
ceedings are necessary to tbe driving out of In
truders upon our waters mo iw uugm to oe en
forced, whatever objections may be made by the
American uovernraent, ana iu spite oi tareau or re
taliation which the President holds out that Cana
dian vessclH will Be refused adaalssion iu American
ports, and that the bonded system, as it Is railed,
under which Canadian merchandise parses through
tbe States is to be susveuded, will not have tse
slightest effect in preveatlngthe assertion of the
just rights of Canada la tbe waters of tbe Ualf.
Tbe number of Canadian vestals entering Ameri
can ports Is quite Insignificant. The stoppage of
the' bonding avalem might cause some Inconveni
ence to individuals in Canada, bat It would enor
mously beuent other parties, and the chief iujury
would fall upou the American transportation lines.
President Grant may try tliase measures ef coer
cion whenever he likes. Ile will not cause the
people of Cauada to abate their claims one jot or
tune.
1 1 Tbe President asserts the right of the United
fctat s to tke free navigation of the bt. Lawraase.
It Is hardly worth wulle to dispute this claim.
Whatever rights the American people may possess
to the navigation of tke river, they certainly have
none to the canal along its bask, wsanever a re
quest kas been made to permit the passage of an
American vessel down the river, It kas always been
b railed, and the President ran hardly allege there
fore tkat eight Slates on the lakes, of which he
makes so much, have been seriously Injured by tke
denial of bis claim. ,
It Is In cowing up the river, we beg to Inform his
Excellency, that the trouble arises. Perkapi ke h.

Manhattan Uaa Company;
In response to a letter from Charles Roorae, Presi
dent of tbe Manhattan Uas Light Company ot New
Tork, 'announcing an appeal from the assessment
of $vl8-TS for gas sold during October last upon
the ground that tke act of 18T2 repealing all laws
Imposing taxes on sales repeals the tax on gas sold.
Acting Commissioner Douglass, quoting the laws
and various tortious Imposing a tax ob gai and also
sections repealing portions of said laws, is of opinion
that the question of the liability of the Manhattaa
tias Company, tn common with all other gas compa
nies In the country, to be assessed and pay taxes
on all gas - manufactured and consumed or
sold by them, is too plain to admit
of ay qussttoa, but if the Manhattan Gas Light
Company is of a different opinion, and sach Is a deci
sion of tbe cosrt, the Internal Revenue oflice will
oppose no other obstacle except to make such a
defense before the court as may be necessary to
protect the interests of the Government In the col
lection of the taxes which Congress has imposed.
