the meeting of the National Civic Fed

address of Hon. Both Low, president
of the organisation. His address was

problems which the federation has un
dertaken to solve
inch 'interest wasr exhibited by
those in at$ndance to tha$ part of the
address qt Hon. Seth Low as presi
dent of the federation which discuss
ed the Increasing demand for in*
portent amendments to the Sherman
anti-trust law, the .efforts of the com
mittee of the federation to secure the
passage of amendments by congress,
•nd- the conflict of interests exhibited
in the search' for a consensus as to
the amendments necessary. Mr. Low
devoted the last part of his address
to this subject, which, he said, rep
resented the most Important work of
the federation during the past year.
After reciting-the efforts of the com-'
mittee appointed for the purpose and
lta: failure to obtain results, Mr. Low
declared that the situation demanded
not so much superficial amendments
as a. change in the. substantive pro
visions of the Sherman law.
"Let no one imagine,, however,"
said Sir. Low, "that it Is an easy
I thing to say what such changes In

law which, Instead of forbidding all
restraints of trade, will forbid only
1
unreasonable restraints of trade and
which will provide amnesty for the
past, (l) on the theoretical ground
that what has been done has often
been done without any realisation
that It was contrary to law and (2)
ion the. practical ground that to at
tempt to rip lip what has already
been done will destroy the Industries
of the country. The representatives
of organised labor, on the other
hand, asked to be ommltted alto
igether from the provisions of the
Sherman* act It Is evident to your
committee that the charges desired
by the mercantile classes are going
to meet with very serious objection,
unless they are combined with some
positive legislation which will pro»
vMe, some effective method Of assur
ing to the country, in the future, the
power to protect itself In advance
from new combinations in the in
dustrial sphere, such as have 'been
madp In the past, and which origi
nally created the sentiment which
placed the Sherman anti-trust law
upon the statute books.
"In other words, precisely as the
city may desire to limit the height
of buildings, for the future, without
taking down those that are already
erected, so, many persons believe
ithat the right to make'commercial

control'even though those already
formed be left "unmolested, and such
persons, also believe that there Is the
Isime inherent light in the body poll
tic to do the one as the other. On
the other hand, the demand of or
ganiied labor to be exempted from
this operations of this act has been
objected to In the past, and Is likely
jtfif bo objected to in the futurej as
class legislation of .a kind that has
no place on American soil, because

"This being the tonus of the prob*

In view of this condition Mr.-Low
sald he looked /for a, constant
strengthening of the demand for 'fed
eral Incorporation of all the larger
organisations doing an inter-state
business, and for a- relation -between
them and the government preolsely
like that between It and the national
banks. But he said:
"No one I suppose, desires to have
the, federal government attempt such
oversight of all inter-state commerce.
The desire for such control Is limited
to the. few very large corporations
whose uncontrolled power may make
then! a source of danger both to the
people and to the commonwealth. It
is evidently impracticable to deter
mlnethe corporations that must be
federally Incorporated by the percent
age of business which they do and
any effort: to determine between ln
ter-state corporations upon the basis
of- Capital, while- It offers a more
easily applied rule, isr after all, pure
ly arbitrary. It has occurred to me
that possibly effective discrimination
could be made by requiring all cor
porations doing inter-state business
to Incorporate federally, whose stocks
or bonds are either listed on the ex
changes or sold upon the curb. In
other words, it is ordinarily only
such corporations that attain a mag
nitude sufficiently great to Involve
seHous questions of public policy.
There is no object whatever in inter
fering with the Aass of corporations
whlcb in the olden
tlmeB
would have
been partnerships, but which, In our
day, have taken the corporate form
for purposes of convenience. I recog
nise that such an outcome, if It is
ever .to take place, will be the Tesult
of along agitation and it may involve
an amendment to the United States
cohstitution 'before anything of this
sort can be done. I apeak of it here

It is possible that, .some' amendment

Except la such a spirit, I apprehend
that nothing .ban be done."
Individual Responsibility
At the outeet of hjo address, after
introductory remarks generally re
porting substantial progress in the
work Of the federation during the
past year, Mr. Low spoke of the Idea
still prevailing among some people
though less generally than formerly,
that their relation. between employer
and employee is an individual one,
-and that worklngmen should still be
dealt with one by one.
"I read In the paper the other day,"
eald Mr,. Low, "that there are 89,000
stockholders In the Pennsylvania
railroad company. No onie contends
that these, people organise into a
company lit order to light labor. They
organise because they have to in or

Men Who Are Guilty—Leaves tho
Matter of Bostoratlon to Congress.-
Washington, Dec. 14.—President
Roosevelt, today sent a message to
congress on the Brownsville affair
and with It a report of Herbert J.
Browne, employed by the war depart
ment in conjunction with Capt .W. Q.
Baldwin to investigate the shooting
up Of Brownsville by the negro sol
dlers. The president says In part:
"This report enables us to fix with
tolerable definitehess at least -some of
the criminals who took the lead In
the murderous shooting of private
citizens at Brownsville. It establishes
clearly the fact that colored soldiers
did the shooting, but upon this point
further record was unnecessary, as
the fact that colored soldiers did the
shooting has already been established
beyond all possibility of doubt The
investigation has not gone for enough
to enable us to determine all the facta
and we will proceed with it, but it
has gone for enough to determine with'
sufficient accuracy certain facts of
enough importance to make lt &dvlaa
ble that I place the report before -you.
It appears that almost all members
of company 'B' must have been ac
tively concerned la^he shooting, eith
er to the extent of being participants
or to extent of virtually encouraging
those who were, participants. As to
companies and 'JJ' there can be no
question that personally every man
in them must have had knowledge
that shooting was done by some of the
soldiers of company 'B', and possibly
by one or two Others In one of the
other troops."
The president says that while this
concealment was a grave offense, they
were probably' cowed by the threats
hy the more desperate men. Then
were' ektehdatia^ clicuinstanim^ and
that they have, be#i..'twjiioiently. pu&

The game was ordered played after

Contributing to the!, excitement of

The Official {Statement.
The following statement regarding
the charges of attempt to bribe Klem
and Johnstone was given out by the
league officials Saturday night:
"When the National league had ap
parently transacted all of Its business
at its meeting Thursday, December 10,
1908, and after the league had receiv
ed an official call from the representa
tives of the American league, Mr. Pul
Uam called attention to a matter
which the undersigned consider not
only of the utmost importance to the
league, but to organized baseball as
well. He stated that Mr. Klem and
Mr. Johnstone, the umpires who had
officiated at the game played between
the New York and Chicago clubs at
the Polo grounds on October 8, 1908,
had submitted to him certain signed
statements that an effort had been
made to bribe them with respect to
their duties pertaining to that con
test In one of these statements the
name of the person who approached
the umpire was given, as well as the
names of persons whom he claimed
to represent. In the other statements
the names of the persons who ap
proached the umpire were not given,
this umpire stating that they were
strangers to him.
"We are of th opinion that a most
thorough and searching investigation
of this entire matter should be made
in order to maintain the high stand
ard and honesty of the game through
out the country and If possible to
punish all persons connected with
tills disreputable proceeding.
"To make such an investigation as
the undersigned desire we deem It un
wise to give out any names of per
sons claimed to have been connected
with this matter as we have grave
doubts as to the truth of certain state
ments alleged, by the person who ap
proached one of the umpires and it
Is for that reason as well as -having
in mind the proper punishment of

Dec. 14—The following delayed story
of the capture Saturday last of the
Venesuelan coast guard ship Allx by
the Dutch cruiser Gelderland, was
obtained today from an officer of the
cruiser:
At 6 o'clock Saturday morning the
Gelderland was-, steaming slowly a
short distance off the tort at Puerto
Cabello. She noticed the Alix coming
in and after taking a position that
prevented the passage of the small
er boat, she ordered her to stop and
sent off a boat to search the Vene
zuelan vessel. It was discovered that
the captain of the Allx had hidden
his Venezuelan pennant In his pock
et and he pretended that his vessel
was a merchant steamer. A passen
ger on board the Allx, howover, de
clared to the Dutch officers that the
Alix was a coast guard vessel. A
search was made. The flag was
found in the captain's pocket and six
rifles and a small quantity of ammu
nition also were discovered. The
rifles were in bad condition. The
crew of the Allx were given their
choice of coming to Cttracao or go
ing ashore at Puerto Cabello. They
preferred the latter courae, embark
ed in one of their own boats and
pulled into the harbor. The Vene
zuelan gunboat Restaurador wa sat
Puerto Cabello and the officers of the
Gelderland could see her getting up
steam. Smoke was pouring from her
funnels. The Gelderland stayed out
side Puerto Cabello for several hoUrs
waiting to see if the Restaudor would
come out, but she did not venture
forth.

ing the Associated Press dispatches
from Wlllemstad, regarding the seiz
ure of a Venezuelan coast guard ship
by the Dutch cruiser Gelderland, the
news was received with interest
though' with little surprise in diplo
matic circles, here. Although Hol
land has had three or four war ves
sels at Curacao or thereabouts for
some- time past no hostile act had
previously occured and there has been
much speculation as to Holland's
purpose. Great Interest attaches to
the Netherlands government's next
move since it apparently intends to
force matters to an issue.
For some time there was talk of a
blockade but such a proposition
might cause Holland to come in con
flict with Germany, England and oth

The state department's attitude has

FLED WITH GROCER
Woman Left Millionaire Home and
Children for Man She Loved
Philadelphia, Dec. 14.—Urged on by
a reward offered by her deserted hus
band, detectives are searching this
city for Mrs. Bertha May Stone, who
eloped from Union town with Emory
Martin, a married man, leaving five
children and an old mother, who com
mitted suicide when she learned of
her daughter's shame.
No word was left at ber home by
Mrs. Stone other than a short note
declaring her love for Martin. The
only trace the police have been able
to find comes from a statement by the
Unlontown station agent, that she
purchased a ticket to Philadelphia.
It Is thought that she is now In hid
ing in this city, making preparations
for a trip to the Philippine Islands.
Suicide Reveals Elopement.
Mrs. Lottie J. Ingalls, the woman's
mother, was prostrated by her daugh
ter's departure and as soon as she
recovered went to her room and cut
her throat She was dead when found.
It was this suicide which brought the
elopement to light
Five children, whom Mrs- Stone left
after purchasing each of them Christ
mas presents are crying for their
mother while the distracted father,
as he comforts them, is bowed by the
shame which has made them worse
than motherless.
Emory Martin, an ex-member ot the
state National Guard, sold out his
grocery business for 92,600 just be
fore leaving. Mrs. Stone took with
hor money and Jewels to the value of
Husband a Millionaire.
W. A.' Stone, the husband, Is a coal
operator and is rated at more than a
million dollars. He had made every
cent of the money since his marriage,
sixteen years ago, to Bertha May In
galls. The marriage had been looked
upon with disfavor by the girl's fath
er because Stone was a cripple but
her mother favored It and the dispute
caused the separation of Mr. and Mra.
Ingalls.
Mr. Stone had never suspected the
clandestine courtship of his wife by
her grocer.
On Wednesday night, December 2,
before he had even begun to worry
about the absence from home of Mrs.
Stone, a servant brought him the fol
lowing note:
"I have gone away with Emll Mar
tin. I don't love you any more and
I do love him. I don't know how I
have managed to live with you as
long as I have. I loved you, I thought
when I married you, but within a
month I ceased to love you. Don't
look for me. Forget me.
—"Bertha.
He collapsed, but soon pulled him
self together to give instructions
which resulted in keeping the matter
secret until last night, though rumors
of an intrigue were bruited about the
neighborhood, when it wag discovered
that both Martin and Mrs. Stone had
disappeared.
Mother Prostrated.
Mrs. Ingalls heard these rumors.
She went Immediately to her son-in
law and learned the truth. After
spending the evening with the chil
dren and their father she prepared to
go to her room.
"No matter what happens to me,"
she told Stone, "you must bring Ber
tha back to the children."
When servants went to call her In
the morning they found only a corpse,
with a ghastly wound at the throat,
lying on the bed in a pool of blood.
This tragedy became known and of
ficers who investigated it learned of
the cause. They discovered also that
Stone had employed the detective
agency which figured in the HartJe
case In Philadelphia to find tbe miss
ing pair, and that he had offered a
reward of 92,600' for the return of his
wife.
Martin Deserted Wife.
Martin left his home and wife the
same day. He told her he was -leav
ing for Georgia to negotiate for a bus
iness in that state and she accom
panied him to the station at Hopwood,
a small town eight miles from Union
town, where they resided. She saw
him buy a ticket to Unlontown.
Mrs. .Stone is* a 'beautiful matron of
thirty-two. She was the leader ot
Unlontown society and a favorite in
exclusive circles of Pittsburg. It is
thought that she was temporarily in
sane when she deserted her home and
that the cries of the five little chil
dren left In the great stone honse
which was hor home will call her
back when she learns of the serious
ness of her mistake.
Mr. Stone has stated unequivocally
that he still loves his wife and will
find her and bring her back.
