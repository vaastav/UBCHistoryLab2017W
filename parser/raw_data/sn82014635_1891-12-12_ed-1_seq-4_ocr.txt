Tlie Chicago Inter Ocean states the
case very aptly, in these words: "Reci
procity means doing well by those who
do well by us. Free trade means home
elaughter for the benefit of other na
tions." Congressman Funston is fighting the
appointment of George T. Anthony as
inter state commissioner and thereby
stabbing Kansas m a very vital piace.
Had Kansas a member on that board it
would be worth millions inside of five
years. "
From the start made in the matter of
new bills introduced for that purpose it
seems pretty certain that there will be
determined efforts made in congress to
legislate further upon the silver question.
From the present wide divergence of
views upon the subject, however, it is
doubtful that any material changes m
the present law will be made.
If the South Carolina legislature enacts
the proposed prohibitory measure now
pending into law, the visiting between
the governors of that state and North
Carolina will have to be done wholly by
the former to the latter, else the memor
able observation of the North state's gov
ernor about tho interval between the
exchange of civilities will of necessity
become obsolete, or Avord to that effect.
Reports of an alarming nature had
gone abroad to tho effect that General
Ben Butler was dangerously sick. The
hero of Fort Fisher has got out of bed
Co deny tho truth of these reports. Ho
cays ho was only suffering from a severe
attack of earache. The Fort Worth Ga
zette is of the opinion that he contracted
Jt a few months ago while trying to hear
the people of Massachusetts ask him to
Consent to run for governor.
The "Wichita Eagle was tho only daily
paper in the great state of Kansas that
published the president's message in full,
word for word, as it came from the
wires. The other dailies published a six
column plate synopsis. Tho possible
plate and tho opportunity it affords of
saving, very exactly measures the ad
vantage held by tho daily that cannot
utilize them.
From tho semi-authcritativo manner
in which Mr. Springer talks about the
Issues likely to como before the present
congress it would seem that the gentle
man is- recognized already, or expects to
be, as the leader of the Democrats of the
house. The talk down in Texas of send
ing Mr. Mills to tho senate will help
along tho Springer boom, and the
Springer preferment in congress will no
doubt help tho Mills senatorial move
ment in Texas.
Speaking of polygamy Mr. Harrison
warns tho nation's solons against "ex
perimenting with this evil," which
prompts an exchange to remark that,
"this portion of tho message will meet
tho approval of tho wive3 of those mem
bers who are supposed to live the lives of
bachelors at tho national capital." If
there wore any truth in the Bogy ro
mance (that cost tho writer of it his
place in one of tho departments) the in
sinuation might be taken as a warning
against tho promiscuous throwing of
blones.
A trunk full of dynamite that was
being caressed by a Texas baggage
smasher exploded and wrecked the car,
but tho smasher was only scared a little
bit. Tho explosion of a dynamite bomb
under Russell Sago extirpated the man
who threw it, killed another, and shat
tered a burglar-proof safe, but Sago was
only jarred up a littlo. If he doesn't
give the Toxas baggage-masher a place
on one of his railroads wo shall mako up
our mind that that saying about a fellow-feeling
making us wondrous kind
was never founded on fact.
A Cincinnati sharper is said to be very
successfully working an old trick on the
citizens of Cloveland. The scheme is to
lease a lot in an aristocratic neighbor
hood for a term of years, and begin
preparations to build a livery stable or a
butcher shop, or something of tho kind
that will prove to bo very objectionable
to tho high-toned neighborhood. Tho
peoplo begin to protest and to kick, but
he goes on with his preparations until
the' make up their minds to buy his
leaso at a considerable advance. Then
he soils out, stuffs tho money in his
pocket and goes to another neighborhood
to repeat tho work.
Neither of the great political parties
into which the American people were
divided during tho administration of
Washington has taken a candidate from
Massachusetts Binco 1S2S. There has al
ways been more provincialism in New
England than oven in Virginia, and, tho
Louisvillo Times thinks, if Mr. Cleveland
ahou'd withdraw from the race forpiesi
dent next year the Democratic party
could not do better than to put young
Mr. Russell at the head of the ticket and
fight a young man's battle. Russell and
Bynum would unquestionably make a
stronger combination than Hill and
Gray. Russell will be 33uext year and
Bynum 45. The ticket would run like
tho cholera, and with the same result to
tho party that runs it.
The senatorial question in Texas prom
ises to assume interesting proportions nt
a very early day. Following tho an
nouncement from Texas that the friends
of Mr. Mills will urge him for tho senate
to succeed Senator Chilton, who is serv
ing out tho unexpired term of ex-Senator
Reagan, by appointment from the gov
ernor Chilton also being a candidate for
election comes tho statement from
Washington that it is understood among
the Texans in that city that Representa
tive Culberson will be a candidate for
the eenate. Judge Culberson was offered
a place on the interstate commerce com
mission in October, but declined it. His
namo has been pressed for one of the
new circuit judgeships, but tho impres
sion prevails that the president ha de
termined to appoint a Republican in that
qircuit. Judge Culberson's announce
ment of his candidacy will probably be
made shortly after tho judicial nomina
tions ak sent to the senate.

W, HAT WILL SEDGWICK DO?
In the event that Governor Humphrey
should not see his way clear to conveno
tho legislature in extra session for the
purposes of congressional apportionment
and an appropriation which would
enablo the state to mako a showing
equal to her deserts at Chicago, where
all the states of the Union and all the
nations of the globe will be assembled to
exhibit their respective superiorities and
triumphs, and which extra session does
not now seem likely, each county in the
stato will bo compelled to make an effoit
in and of itself in aid of the state.
The question is, what doe3 Sedgwick
propose to do? The wonderful display of
grasses and of grains made at Phila
delphia in 1870, by Kansas, were princi
pally furnished by tho "Big Four"
counties of the Arkansas valley.
Kansas at Chicago with tho Arkan
sas valley left out would bo
Kansas without her longest plumes and
finest feathors. Sedgwick, county be
cause of her wealth, although ono of tho
now counties of the state is asked by the
state board to give more than any other
county in the itate save one. But Sedg
wick, Sumner, Cowley, Butler, Harvey
and Reno make up a cluster of counties
that the board cannot get along without.
As yet no movo has been made, worth
speaking of, to raise Sedgwick's quota,
which is 4,030. Tho commissioners of
many of the counties have simply appro
priated their respective quotas
in response to larjrelv eicn-
ed petitions. This seems the
most equitable way, and equivalent to
a legislative appropriation and would
bear on all equally, while any other
scheme would simply leave the burthen
to the generously inclined, the liberal
spirited and tho enterprising. Of course
no board of commissioners would mako
such an appropriation unless requested
to do so by the leading taxpayers and by
representative citizens of all political
parties. Tho will of the people would
have to be clearly and emphatically ex
pressed. Kansas has had a fine site assigned
her on tho exposition grounds for
her building and spaco reserved
in every department, and the board is at
work gathering productions of tho past
season and aro making arrangements to
raid every fair ground in tho state next
year hoping that tho matter will turn
out all right and that Kansas may make
as big a hit at Chicago as she did at Phil
adelphia so the question propounded by
tho Eagltj, what is Sedgwick county go
ing to do? whero will the Arkansas val
ley be in that showsbecomes an urgent
one.
KANSAS IN CONGRESS.
Kansas has lost all her prominenco in
tho lower house of congress, all her
chairmanships and all her influence by
tho election of a lot of chumps whom
even a Democratic speaker wont recog
nize. When anybody gets so low down
in the scale of human affairs that a
Democrat wont recognize him, heaven
help the peoplo for whom such an one
stands as the choice and representative.
Simpson and Ins crowd are not even
recognized as having minority rights.
THE "TARDY BELL.'
Judging from the report published in
another column, the great end in view
among the managers of our public schools
seems to be the eliuiinutiou of tardiness.
While punctuality is a thins; to be desired,
ami habits of promptness should be en
couraged, there is such a thing as carrying
this anti-tardy crusado too far. It has
come under our observation more thnu
onco that children one miuuto late have
ret urned home, to loae a half day from
school, rather than incur the wrath of some
tencher trying to mako a clear record on
tardiness. Hutchinson News.
The tardy bell is but the symbol of
"tho machine" in the public school sys
tem, and it has put more children in the
coffin than it ever benefitted. It is a
nerve trying, soul distracting, family
disturbing piece of unreasonableness
which was evolved, and is now enforced,
solely in the interest and for tho benefit
of those who aro paid for their time to
instruct and not to kill. The wishes,
desires, nor convenience of the parents
who put up the money aro consulted in
this "tardv bell" outrage.
MORE PROHIBITION.
It is only ho who is hit hardest that
squeals loudest, as a rule. Frances "Vil
liard, the great apostle of the efficacy of
prohibitory laws, has stirred up trouble
down in the original Neil Dow state of
Maine by denouncing the chewing gum
habit and demanding in the namo of the
health of the people that it be prohibited
by law. Now the largest per cent of
real chewing gum come3 from the Pine
Tree stato and the papers down there are
hot in their denunciations for this attack
upon their commerce and upon the per
sonal liberty of their boys and girls. The
truth is, most advocates of prohibitory
legislation would fight in a minute any
law which proposed to prohibit them of
and habit. The use of tobacco, for in
stance, is both pernicious and filthy, and
coffee is a narcotic, yet the users of these
among tho Frances Williard class of
thinkers would raise an indignant pro
test if the city council of their respective
towns, or other law making power,
should prohibit their use under any pen
alty however light.
AN EASTERN ERROR.
The New York Herald denounces
Mills because he favors an income tax.
"The selection of one "(for speaker) who
believes in an income tax would be con
demned in every quarter of the United
States," says the Herald.
The mistake of the Herald, which is a
common mistake of the New York and
other eastern newspapers, is in imagin
ing that it speaks for "every quarter of
the United States," The Herald and
the eastern constituency that it serves
are no better prepared to speak for the
people west of the Allegheny mountains
than for the people of France or Ger
many. There are great a many quarters of the
United Stater where a tax on incomes be
yond a certain figuie would, be a pop
ular thing, and it is quite within the
scope of possibilities that Buch a tax will
be imposed by congress. It would reach
the class of people who aro best able to
bear a tax for the support of tho govern
ment, and who are the most expert at
evading taxation under existing laws.
If that is the worst thing the Herald
can find to say against Mills, it had bat
ter keep quiet
Atchison Champion: "Why don't
women grow bald like men? Because
sho don't go waltzing around town in
her shirt sleeves with a cigar between
her teeth and into every saloon she spies,
nor go fishing with a bottle in each
pocket and sit all day on the damp
ground and go home drunk at night.
Nor yank off her coat, spit on, her hands
and promenade around on the street
cornor for a half hour on a raw day
swearing she could lick any man in
town." And futhermore, she is not im
pelled to pull her hair out by number
less unbearable vexatious, such as the
payment of sundry bills for unnecessary
and extravagant notions, nor by the
failure on tho part of indulgent hus
bands to exeicise proper control of the
children and his xefusal to allow the
wife and mother to discipline -them.
These and' a scoraTof other similar reas
ons may lead to the 'discovery 'of why
we grow bid diffeiently.
THE OPENING OF THE
STRIP.
CHEROKEE
To tho Editor of the Eacle.
The time has arrived for the opening
of the Cherokee outlet. Lying along the
southern border of Kansas aro more than
six million acres of tho finest unsettled
lands on the American continent. It is
a domain, immensely fertile in soil,
salubrious in climate and posbessed of
magnificent resources. Tho time has
come for congressional action. Well did
the committee on the territories of the
last house of representatives declare, in
reporting a bill for tho opening of tho
Cherokee outlet. "This is a situation
not borne with toleration, or looked upon
with equanimity by the poor people of
the country seeking homes, and is oue
that should be remedied by tho govern
ment at the earliest possible hour."
Tho lands of the Cherokee outlet will
mako home3 for 37,626 families of 160
acres each. The lands of Oklahoma
proper, consisting of 1,8S7,800 acres were
settled as by magic, almost in a single
day.
In about sixteen months after their
settlement, by the census of 1890, these
lands contained a population of 61,934
people. The Sac and Fox, Iowa and
Pottowatomie lands have recently been
settled, and the Cheyenne and Arapahoe
reservations will soon follow.
Tho public domain of arable land has
been narrowed to tho very smallest area.
Tho best land in tho entire domain of
the government is in tho Indian Terri
tory. The choicest land of the Indian
Territory is in the Cherokee outlet
Tho subjugation of this entire con
tinent by tho whites is inevitable. Their
progress is as irrosistablo as the Christian
religion. Tho ebb and flow of the great
waves of population in this country
means tuo rapia suDmergmg or tne
newer spates and territories, and the
rapid settlement of the Indian lands, to
the entiro extinction of all of the tribal
relations.
The western idea of the Indian is vastly
different, from the Quuker idea of the
east hero we know him as he is. Red
Jacket, Tecumseh, Black Hawk, the
noble warrior, and the Indian princess
have passed away. Scar-Faced Charley
and "John" are here, and "How John"
is the common salutation. No man who
has ever resided in the west has ever
seen an Indian princess; most of us have
seen an Indian squaw, wearing a pair of
worn-out soldier cavalry pants.
In an early day, tho place faces intro
duced fire-wateramong the red men, but
it was reserved for the higher type of
civilization existing in the present cen
tury, to initiate the noble red man into
the mysteries of the deadly cigarette. A
passenger riding upon any of the lints of
railway, leading through the Indian
country, will find today, at the various
railway stations, bucks, squaws, and
even small papooses, puffing cigarettes,
with all of the reckless abandon of a
Western Union Telegraph messenger
boy. Such are some of tlie present con
ditions of the Indian country. These
will change, like tlie views of a magic
lantern, under the benign touch of civ
ilization, and tho dissolving of the tribal
relations.
Striking southward from Arkansas
City, the traveler crosses the Arkansas
river, and in a moment the train crosses
the Kansas line. The beautiful Cherokee
outlet spreads before him. Here is an area
of country sufficient to mako twelve
counties. Two great trunk lines of rail
way, the Atchison and Rock Island cross
the" outlet Open the strip to settlement,
and as by magic, towns will spring up
along the lines of railway named, and
"corner lots will be staked for sale above
old Indian graves." A large number of
people are waiting all over the western
country, to settle on the Cherokee strip.
many are in camp now along Uie sou in
with long-
ern ooraer ot xtausa, iuuMu
ingeves into the promied land. Ten
days "af ter the opening will suffice to put I
100,000 people upon the Cherokee out
let. The opening of these lands might
temporarily hurt Southern Kansas. The
reaction and rebound, would mora than
reccompense us, and the sooner now
that the opening occurs, the better.
Another thing to be considered by this
city, is that all of the Cherokee out-let
is naturally tributary to Wichita. The
sentiment of our people, is for congress
to open tho out-let to settlement. Here
is an opportunity for Mr. Simpson, Mr.
dover and Mi. Buckwheat in the Kan
sas delegation. They can now distin
guish themselves, Will they come to
iua front.

A EANSAN DEAD.
From the Kansas City Gazette.
Captain B, J. F. Hanna, a Kansas vet
eran, died at "Washington, D. C, on
Tuesday. His remains will be brought
to Kansas for burial. Captain Hanna,
in the fall of 1866, settled in Salina, and
established the Salina Herald, the first
paper published west of Junction City.
He was born in Pope county, Illinois,
February 24, 182o. " In 1849 he estab
lished the Cheater Herald, at Chester,
1113. In 1856 he removed to Alton. In
the Spring of 1861 he enlisted in the
army and served until January, 1866.
He was married to a sister of Colonel
William A. Phillips. He served a term
as register of the land office at Hays
City, and was, a member of the legisla
ture from Trego county. He was a past
grand master of the Odd Fellows for the
state of Illinois, and represented that
state and also Kansas in the Sovereign
Grand Lodge. He was also very promi
nent and actiyo as a Mason. He was a
very earnest Republican, and came from
a long line of Presbyterian ancestry, and
was a member of that church himself.
He was a number one man and did the
world good for having lived.
IS BLAINE TO RETIRE?
The New York Mail and express pub
lishes the following from Washington:
Within the last twenty-four hours
Secretary Blaine and President Harrison
have had a most important conference,
and it is stated that one of the chief
topics discussed was the coming ap
pointment of a secretary of war. Mr.
Blaine is reported to have told the presi
dent that the appiontment of Mr. Stephen
B. Elkins to the vacancy would be most
eminently satisfactory to him and at the
same time be a good appointment for
the couutry.
In connection with this interview, Mr.
Blaine's friends now say that if Mr.
Elkins gets the war portfolio it will be
closely followed by a public announce
ment by Mr. Blaine of his retirement
from the presidential race in 1893. This
is confirmed by the fact that Mr, Blaine
has at last spoken on this subject. In
conversation with a friend within the last
week he distinctly stated that he was
not now and would not be a candidate
for nomination at Minneapolis next June.
This was the plan Mr. Blaine has adopted
in place of a card, but it is now again
made public in rumor shape that just
before the new year, Mr. Blaine will
issue a letter, already carefully prepared,
giving his reasons for retiring, and
strongly declaring, in no uncertain
words, in favor of Mr. Harrison. Then,
when in reality 1892 is ushered in, there
will be but one candidate before the Re
publican party.
YeJ there is a feeling among the sena
tors that the man to be selected by the
president for his cabinet is not Mr.
Elkins, but ex-Governor Cheney of New
Hampshire. His name Is still really the
only ono mentioned- by gossip, but the
fact is the president has not intimated to
any one his preference, and the delay in
sending in the name is due to the fact
that the president has not yet decided on
his choice. The recent interviews may
hasten the nomination.
THE JEWS OP TOLEDO.
Correspondence of tho New York Observer.
All around these ancient synagogues
aro the narrow streets inhabited by
Israelites. Their houses are small, but
cleaner than anywhere else in Spain.
Their history in Toledo has been a sad
one. They "lived there in great security
and prosperity during the reign of the
Moors, but when the Christians took the
city their tribulations began. They were
taxed at thirty pieces of silver a head,
that being the wage3 of the traitor, Judas
Iscariot. They only saved their syna
gogues by a curious affirmation. They
declared that their ancestors had not
consented to the death of Jesus Christ
When he was brought to the council
over which Caiphas presided, tho
votes were taken by tribes whether
Christ should be released or put to death.
One tribe voted for his acquittal, and
from them the Jews of Toledo have des
cended. The JewiBh claim with a Latin
translation of the Hebrew text is pre
served in the archives of the Vatican.
But their memorial did not save the To
ledan Jews from persecution. In 1439
their market, whick was near the cathe
dral, was suppressed; in 1454, at the in
stigation of San Vincente Ferrer, Santa
Maria Blanca, their synagogue was
taken fro n them; in 1460, the Christians
plotting the further oppression and rob
bery of the Jews circulated a story that
Juan Pas3atnonle, a boy of Guardia, had
been stolen, crucified, and his heart pre
served as a charm against tho inquis
ition. In 1478, every Jew who would
not be baptized wa3 put under the ban,
and when the inquisition was established
at Toledo, 17,000 Jews became good
Catholics at a stroke. In 1492, every
unbaptized Jew was compelled by
Ferdinand and Isabella to quit
Spain, and more than 170,000 were cru
elly expelled, chosing banishment and
the loss of all things rather than to be
come false to their faith. Persecution
by the government is ended in Spain, and
Jews may worship when and as they
choose, but they thrive most in half civ
ilized and degraded countries or in dense
communities where theiravarice, shrewrd
ness and devious ways can be concealed,
and hence free Spain is not half so Jew
ish as persecuting, intolerant and igno
rant Spain was. Perhaps the time may
come when the great empire of the
north will become so civilized that the
Jew will find no more the opportunities
for making ignorant peasants unwilling
contributors to his wealth, and when
the banishment of Israelites will be un
known in any nation.

A Loading- Question.
From the Lawrence Journal.
At first glance the petition sent by the

themselves looks like a very funny piece
of business. When you think about it
the second time, however, it isn't so
funny. Have they not just as much

From the Akansius City Dispatch.
The cranks who undertake to kill off
millionaires have a thankless job on their
hands as well as a very wicked one. It
is the great law of humanity that no man
has a right to take another's life, except
to save his own. Although Rusell Sage
is not a producer of anything except
financial panics and business disasters
and is perhaps of no more real use than
the wretch who, it is thought, tried to
kill him, it is some satisfaction to know
that the would-be murderer got the
woret of it. There are better ways to
reform millionaires than killing them.
A Sort of Dissolving View.
From the Newton Republican.
"No tax on iron was ever so great as
the tax he pays who lbaves hi3 mowing
machine unsheltered in the storm."
This is the conclusion of a writer in the
Forum and he is correct. Several years
ago it waB no uncommon thing to see
the cultivator left in the last row plowed,
the $500 harvester in the middle of the
field, the threshing machine by the side
of its last straw stack, and even yet,
hardly a farmer in tho state thinks
enough of his wagon to put it under
cover. These sights are not so common
as they used to be.

HOW AN AUNT WA6 FOUND.
A. Lout Child "Whoso Knowledge ol
Botany Catno Into Good Flay.
Colonel W. D. Moore tells a story which
would, could it be given in print as Mr.
Moore tells it, produce a great effect.
Ex-Sheriff Cluley was accosted a day or
two since at tho corner of Sixth street
and Liberty avenue by a little tot, a girl,
too young to talk plainly, who pulled at
his coat and asked "Do 'oo know Annt
Tatie?'
Somewhat surprised, Mr. Cluley re
plied that he could not say unless lie
knew "Aunt Tatie's" last name. The
child opined that the wanted party
didn't have any lastname; she was "diet
Aunt Tatie." The little one then ex
plained that sho was lost, and she was in
great distress, her lips quivering so that
at times she could scarcely speak.
Mr. Cluley thought with all his might
for a few moments, when an idea struck
him and he asked the child for a descrip
tion of his aunt. The little maiden re
plied that "Aunt Tatie" was rather tall
and wore nasturtium flowers in her bon
net. Now, Mr. Cluley would hardly stand
a creditable examination in botany. He
knows cabbages from potato vines, and
knows the nasturtium when he sees it
on the table in the shape of a pickle, but
to save his soul he could not tell what
its flower was like. Again he rubbed
his dome of thought until he rubbed
into it a fresh suggestion and acted upon
it at once. Accosting a lady who was
passing, he asked her if she knew a nas
turtium flower when she saw it She
was at first disposed to resent the ques
tion a3 an impertinence, when Mr. Clu
ley hastened to explain, and begged her
to take an observation and ascertain
whether there were any ladies in the
neighborhood with that familiar flower
in their bonnet3.
Tho lady glanced into several milli
nery and dry goods stores, and finally
called ont that she had discovered a
lady with a bonnet bearing the flower
wanted. She pointed her ont, and im
mediately the little one cried out joy
fully, "That's Aunt Tatie."
"Aunt Tatie" was disposed to be cross
with her charge for wandering away
from the spot she had designated to wait
until her annt did gome shopping, but
Mr. Cinley's feelings were aroused, and
he wouldn't hear the little one scolded.
Instead he proceeded to reprimand the
woman for her thoughtlessness in leav
ing her charge exposed to the danger of
being kidnaped.
"Aunt Tatie" had become so interested
in her shopping that she had forgotten
to note the flight of time. Had the little
one not been bright enough to recollect
the name of the flower m the bonnet she
would probably have been crying her
eyes oat, a guest at the central station,
and her aunt would have been frantic

RAISING OF THE CEREAL.

"Tell you something about rica in
Louisiana?" repeated Andrew C Wilkin
son, the owner of a large rice mill in
New Orleans, where the rice grown on
his plantation is cleaned, at the Gilsey
House. "I see that the papers have just
found ont that Englishmen are trying
to buy up and form, a trust of the rice
mills in the south, although the agents
have been down there for something
over six months. Nobody is quicker
than John Bull to scent a bargain.
"New Orleans is the chief rice milling
city of America. Fifty years ago we
did not have such a thing as a rice mill,
but now we have sixteen, working 220
rice pounders and employing more than
1,200 men. Louisiana has always been
known as the Sugar State, but we also
want to add to it that of the Rice State
of the Union.
"How is it cultivated? "Well, the
first necessity of profitable rice culture
is a comparatively level piece of land,
properly prepared for the seed. This field
must be located so as to be conveniently
irrigated from tho prairie reservoir or
the flume in the levee. Highland rice
does not pay in Louisiana, the only
profitable rice being that grown in
water. "Water is the first and last want
of sprouting, growing and ripening rice.
Before the ground is ready for the seed
it is divided up by a system of littlo
sublevees and watering ditches. It is
then planted in drills dug by machines
or rather I should say that the ma
chine is the proper way to do it, but the
seed is frequently broadcasted with us in
Louisiana.
"Then comes the most delicate part,
in the water manipulation. After the
seed is planned the soil is thoroughly
saturated with water to sprout, it, but
the water is at once taken off when the
seeds have evenly germinated, and kept
off until the tender shoots of the plant
rise two or three inches above the
ground. You can easily Bee that the
young plants may be either drowned out
or dried up by the least inattention in
regulating the flow.
DRAWBACKS TO THE WORK.
On the other hand, with too much
water, crawfish invade the fields and de
vour the delicate plants, while with nono
at all, rice caterpillars cut them down
and kill them. If you neglect the main
flume you not only risk the total loss of
your crop, but by permitting the water
to get ahead of you there may come a
break in the levee, and away go your
cattle and crops.
"The most expensive part of rico grow
ing comes when it is about a foot high,
after it has been liberally watered; I
mean the grassing of the rico. You see,
the laborers wade through the rice, pull
ing up and throwing into heaps all tho
weeds and water grasses they find. This
grassing costs on an average about f our
dollars an acre, and after that is over
the rice planter has but little to do ex
cept to give it plenty of water. One pe
culiar thing about irrigation is that the
heads of the rice plants never fill out,
no matter how much water you give
them artificially, unless there are plenti
ful rains.
"One feature of rice cultivation would
be great fun to city sportsmen, but 13 a
terrible nuisance to us. I mean the
birds. Talk about your ducks and geese
hiding the sun. Perfect clouds of rice
birds, English sparrows, summer ducks,
rail and other fowl of the air and wa
ter, come to see if they can't harvest our
crops for us. From daybreak to dark a
perfect fusilade from the guns and old
muskets is heard in hundreds of square
miles of country. Over in this field you
hear the shrill shouts of creole farmers
shrieking ont Sunday school language in
French patois; from the next probably
the deep chested whoop of negro field
hands, and in another the hoarse yell3
of the new American rice growers
those who havo come from the great
northern wheat fields. It is Bcreaml
pop! whoopl bangl boom! in the
noisiest battle from dawn to dark that
you ever heard-
"The rico birds are our worst enemies,
and while we kill millions of them, left
to manure the fields, other millions come
in to take their places. Tho ravages of
the rice birds some years are fearful,
the crop being almost a total loss. Per
haps now that the Yankees are coming
down to grow rice they may invent some
machine that will either destroy the
birds or keep them away.
PROFITS OF RICE CULTURE.
"As soon as a pale yellow tint appears
over the level heads of the opening
grain the water is carefully drawn off,
the fields being drained as thoroughly as
possible, and the work of harvesting ia
begun. The dried sheaves are carted
direct from the field to the steam
thresher, where the grain is prepared for
market
"The profits in rice planting, with good
luck, will in a few years make any man
rich. The yields on good lands in Lou
isiana give from fifty to seventy-five
bushels to the acre. Rice is a plant
which is generous to the attentive and
industrious farmer, but it resents neg
lect more tnan any other cereal. A man
can cultivate fifteen to twenty acrea of
rice land, and if strong and industrious
ha can easily secure front 1,000 to 1,500
bushels of rice, worth at present prices
about a dollar a bushel. The work is
not hard, except during gracing ttme,
and, as good living Is cheap with us, a
tall nee farmer can easily save one
half of his gross income.

Cfalldlsh Faith.
An examrle of childish faith, of a kind
a dull age wears away, was seen tho
other day. A little boy was sitting In
the yard of an old country homestead;
on either sido of him sat a huge dog, pa
tient and loving. The sun ihono down
scorchingly on tho trio, and its rays were
uncomfortable. Shading his eves with
his curved hand the child looked sky
ward and Baid, "Pnt in that sun, pleaso."
The sun shono brightly, and the little
fellow repeated aoftly, "Please pnt In
that sun, man up in tho sky; It hurts my
head."
Just then over the face of the blazing
orb there sailed a white summer cloud,
then another, and the yellow blaze
turned suddenly to a hazy, restful gray.
Turning to tho dogs, tho littlo boy, put
ting an arm around the neck of each,
said: "Did you see tho sun pulled in,
Romeo and Chieftain? When you wants
anything, if you is good, and you asks Qod
for it, he gives it to you. The sun hurt
my head, and I asked him to put it in,
and don't you see how he did reach out
and put it in for me?" The dogs looked
f wise, leaned their heads lovingly toward
tho diminutive little theologian, and
whatever might have been their belief,
kept an inscrutable silence. Providence

Tniy ye Are Light and Durlc
An interesting point is tho cause of
tho different shades of color we see In
the eyes. On a certain membrane in the
interior are numerous cells, called "pig
ment" cells. When these aro preaent in
very great numbers they produce that
deep black color of some eyes, and in
proportion to their numbers decreas
also the depth of color, till finally a light
bine is reached. In certain eyes the
pigment cells do not exist at all, being
wanting, indeed, all through the system,
hair and skin. A person of this descrip
tion is called an albino, and among ani
mals we find a parallel in tbe caw of
the white rabbit. Chambers' Journal
