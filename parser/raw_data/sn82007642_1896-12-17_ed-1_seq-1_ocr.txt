If I wanted an.vthinp from
Hanna, I'should hunt tin the
millionaire who had contrihu
ted to his committee, for a
backer, instead of bothering
with political in fluence. Mark
regards politics as simply a
question of money ,'nn'l not
of principles, and I make'the
'w preoiction right now that
the millionaires of the coun
try will be far more influm
tial with the WcKinley ad
S ministration, than the poli
" ticians.
How to do nothing while
pretending to be trying to
4) do something, will be the
motto of the republican lead
ers during tho present fus
ion of Congress. It has been
' fully decided at Canton that
. an extra session of Congress
' shall be called to pass a tar
iff bill, and that nothing
Q must oe done at this session
to give the republican oppo
; - nents of an extra session of
whom there are many, an ex
cuse for saying there is no
v necessity for one, .Under the
circumstances this jwiU not
be a difficult task, The reg-
Ji ular approptiationl)ill8 can
jr easily be manipulated so as
to take up all the time of the
' short session.

doubtless of many of Mr.
Clevelands admirers ; in pri
vate life. But it has had a
hout the same effect upon
Conprew as a' whole as the
distribution of ""a batch of
temperapce or religious tract
would Jinye had. -It has bpt-n
received withindifftrencp, It
is neither : praised nor de
nounced to any mnrkpd ex
tent, although some features
of it may, a little later on be
made the text for some inter
esting speeches.
Tom Reed is to day the
most independent man in
the republican party. Mc
KSnley needs his support far
more than he needsanything
that McKmley will have toJ
give, and nobody knows it
any bettpr than the big man
from Maine, who will be fleet
ed Speaker of the next House
without raising a finger, al
though the McfCinleyites
would give much for some
scheme that would enable
them to down him,-but" they
dare not make an open moye
in that direction.
Those enemies of thedeir.o-
crane party wno nad some
how, most probably because
they wished . it, gotten the
idea that Senator Hill intend
ed to attempt to knock the
h'ottom out of things by ma
king a speech in the .Senate
in which he would pay all his
political and some of his per
sonal debts by telling things
that ought not to be lold
und saying things which ivere
best left unsaid, have been
bal king up the wrong tree.
Senator Hill may think h
lias political wrongs to a
venge. butit can b) stated
upon the very highest au-thority-that
of himself t ha t
he hasn't the slightest idea of
assuming the role of a public
avenger on the floor of the
Senate, ind that instead of
trying to widen the breach
between democrats he will en
deavor to bring about a bet
ter state of party feeling.
Representative IWry of
Ky. who was reelected has
this to say of the election in
that state: "On a squareahd
fair count Kentucky would
ha'-e gone for Bryan by at
least 25000 majority. But
money was used without
stint, and it is one o f t h e
most potent factors in mo I
em politics.. There is always
a purch'iseable element, and
when money is as plentiful as
it was in Kentucky this year
there is no trouble in getting
mercenary recruits. But the
democrats elected seven out
of the eleven Congressman in
spite of the corrupt methods
of the opposition, and two
years hence the democratic
ticket will sweep, the state."
Progressive Farnrer: The
State platform of the Popu
list party cnlls upon the Jeg
Islature to forbid the use of
free passes by any public of
ficer. No plank is more ac
ceptable to the. people. The
railroads will haul freeey;ry
member of tha Legislature
who will come under that ob
ligation. The railroads have
several valuable axes they
wish this legislatare to grind.

din some of th men vvlro fig

afiiong thes he places Sena
tor Marion Btitler or North
Carolina, chairman of.th
Po)alit. National Commit-
! r-c. In on: of his editorials
Mr. Watson si.vs:
"As long MS Marion Butler

Nationalcommittee.it will be
utterly impossible to get the
real PopulUt to take n in

know him to be a self,
ish, unprincipled triekhter,
and nothing he can nov do
will ever cause tbem to forget
what a liar and traitor he
was duiing the campaign of
1896. .,
"Judged from the Butler
stand point, Populism is h
mere a i tide of political mer
chandise. He is ( evoid of any
sense of honor. Words are
to him the mere tools in the
game of deception.

no point in the game !iy do
ing so. nor does he mind tell
ing an untruth,' even if it
yields him nothing morethan
the casual pleasure of having
deceived.
"We harbor no resentment
against Butler. It would be
unjust to do so. When a con
stitutional coward runs a way
from the battle field all gener
ous men feel a profound sym
pathy for the victim of a 'nt
ural defect of character, In
the same way we judge Mari.
on Butler. Nature made him
what he is, and ha cannot
help it.
''To be foxy double faced,
false of tongue and treacher
ous at heart is natural to
him, and when he betrays
those who trust him and de
ceives those who are silly en
ough to take him at h i h
word, he has no more sinned
against his nature than does
our friend, the 'William goat'
when it fiirhts with its horns
ratlmr than mouth and feft.
'Too mnch Butler limbers
us in the region of our faith.
Too much Butler gives us the
inclination to look with long
ingeyes in the direction of
the mountains of Hepsidain.

ough of Butler to last him u

ders of the gospel in Northern Vir
ginla wre the Revs. Rozell. of
the Metho list church, and Gil
more, of the Baptist. On one oc
cusion they both had appoint
ments in Leesburg on the same
Sun lay., Returning to t heir
homes after church the two con
gregations met on opposite sides
of the same street.
The Methodist divine, thinking
to deliver a pniatting thrust in
the hearing of almost the whole
of both flocks, called across the
Btreet to the shepherd of the Bap
tint lold:
"How, d'ye do, Brother Gil
more; one ot your members join
ed our church to-day."
4-Ah, ha, that's all right," re
plied the placid 1mm 'isiomst,
"backsliding Baptists make verj
good Methodists."
One communion day in the Bap
tist church, the Rev. Roszoll made
it a point to be present, having
no service at his own church on
that day. Mr Gilmore spread
ihe tfotumunion table with great
care just in front of where the
Methodist divine was sitting, and
when all was r ady he, with great
solemnity, slid in his powerful
and impressive voice:
'Brother Roszell, if this were
my table I should invite yon to
partake: but being my Father's
I dare not!"
Instead of sinking through the
floor, Mr. Roszell calmly replied:
"Brother Gilmore, if this were
your table I should await yonr
invitation: but being my father's
I shall help myself." and, suit
ing the action to the word, reach

clines to give the remunera
tion that Mr. Bryan is to re

tion says thereport that he
was to receive $50,000 toi tif

He willget more than that.
The figure is such a hand
some one that Mr. Bryan's
many disappointed admirers
may take some consolation
in the fact that before the
dawn of theeoming inaugural
day their defeated but not
vanquished champion will
have earned an amount al
r.iost equal to the yearly sal
ary of the President of the
United Stntes. This amount
will place Mr. Bryan, who is
now a poor man, insufficient
ly independent circumstances
to enable him to devote his
time and labor to the cher
ished cause of bimetallism.
The fact that Mr. Bryan re
ceived so large a vote as he
did. says Mr. Schurz, "is a re
suit which certainly was not
owing to popular ignorance
and blind partisanship alone,
but to the existence of discon
tents not entirely groundless,
the causes of which should bo
examined with candor, care
