Congress.
The second and last session *f the 43d
Congress commenced on Monday, and
the President's Message, a synopsis of I
which we publish in another column,
taken from the Baltimore Gnzcttr, was
rend iti both Houses.
tn the Senate the credentials of Messrs.
Edmunds and Eaton were presented.—
Mr. Morrill reported from the special
Committee an entirely new scheme of
government for the District of Columbia,
embracing a system of Municipal Boards
the chief of whom shall be three Regents,
to be appointed by the President and eon
firmed by the Senate. Mr. Sherman sub
mitted a bill for the revision of the Cus
toms laws. Among other bills introduc-;
od was one for the relief of the Western
sufferers by the ravages of the grasshop
pers. and another to break up the impor
tation of Chinese into California under a
system of slavery.
In the House a number of the new
members who had been elected to fill va
cancies were sworn in. The forwardness
rff business was remarkable for the open
ing of the session, six of the Appropria
tion bills being reported and days fixed
for their consideration. These, and the
amounts named in them, were as follows:
Legislative. Executive and Judicial.
$19,053,434; Army. $27,701,500; In
dian, $4,805,807; Fortifications. $850,-
000; Naval. slo,97o,7o6;Consular and
Diplomatic. $1,338,935. Mr. Phelps
endeavored to introduce a bill for the
repeal of the Poland (Jag law of the lasi
session, but he was shutoff by Mr. But
ler. The irrepressible Mr. Cox could
not refrain from letting Mr. Butler know
how good ho felt over the elections by
reminding the latter that his (Cox’s)
side of the House would soon be iu the
majority. After this remark the House
adjourned, Mr. Phelps giving notice that
he will press his bill for the repeal of
the Poland law.
Secretary Bristow's Report
The inflationists will derive no more
comfort from the report of the Secretary
of the Treasury than from the Presi
dent's message, as it is fully as emphatic
iu its advocacy of a speedy return to
specie payments. He recommends that
the date at which resumption shall begin
be fixed at not more than throe years
from the present, and then in order to
raise gold for the purpose of redeeming
so much of the paper issue as may be
presented authority should be conferred
upon the Secretary of the Treasury to 1
sell bonds. The legal-tender act should
be repealed, the repeal to take effect from
a fixed date, and to apply to all contracts
made after that date, except the expen
ditures of the Government under exist
ing appropriations. He does not favor
the restoration of the moiety system,
but thinks that the penalties for the vio
lation of the customs laws have been in
juriously modified in several particulars.
In regard to the tariff, he recommends
that if Congress should determine to:
take any action upon it. it should be!
done deliberately; to which end he sug
gests that a commission be appointed to
revise the tariff and report to the next:
Congress. He urges rigid economy ami
a careful revision of the estimates of ex
penditures.
Secretary Robeson’s Report.
Sseretary Robeson's report, shows our
little navy to be in good condition, con- i
sidering the small amount of money that
is spent upon it and the age of many of
its ships. It now consists of 163 vessels
of all classes, but probably one-third of
these are practically worthless. We
have seventy-three steam vessels nomi
nally fit for cruising, but there are but
fifty- eight of them that are of service.!
and of these forty-one are now in com
mission. Twenty-one of our iron-clads
can do duty, and the rest are ready for
the junk shop. Mr. Robeson devotes a
considerable portion of hie report to a
commendation of the great naval drill
off the Florida const last winter as a
specimen exhibition of the discipline and
efficiency of the navy. The Secretary
WMrhere favors extravagant expenditures
but he argues that there should be a re
gular addition to the navy each year to
replace worn-out and retired ships. An
interesting portion of the report is that
treating of the movement amongst the
people of Iceland to abandon their an
cient home ami settle upon the North
Pacific coast of the l United States.

The President’s Message.
The Message of President Grant, as ‘
transmitted to Congress, is iu many re- ,
gpccts a more forcible one than could
have boon anticipated from those which
have hitherto emanated from our self-in
dulgent President. In the very begin
ning he touches sharply upon the exist
i ing financial distress of the country. —
i Business and industries are. ns he truly
Fj says, prostrated, while lalsir and capital
are plenty, -’ He therefore thinks that
“wise statoßttwuiship at this session of
Congress would dictate legislation ignor
ing the past, directing in proper chan
nels these great elements of prosperity."
I Most excellent advice, if only carried
f out. The large public debt he considers
, an element of depression, and the “sys
■ tem of currency'’—paper—wlticli it is
. impossible to keep at par, has. fie thinks,
• induced a most pernicious spirit of spee
■ ulation and extravagance among the pe<>-
• pic. Rather coolly, if not sarcastically,
• j he remarks that he docs not question toe
, wisdom of the introduction of this cur
rency at the time of its adoption. He
urges, as a matter of justice and good
‘ faith, that the bonds held abroad should
i be paid in coin or its equivalent, or else
! National disgrace is inevitable. To oh-!
tain means for this, commerce, tnnnufnc
’ I tures and agriculture should bo encour
•! aged. The first step to bo taken is, he
, says, “to secure a currency, good wher
ever civilization reigns," and this, lit
thinks, consists only of gold and silver.!
to which we most return at the earliest j
I possible moment, and until that Is don.
. In- ilet-biros that no permanent prosperity
can be expected. The delay in resump
tion of specie payment partakes of dis
-1 honesty, and the only way to resumption
• is through the positive action of Congress.
. He says: “I believe it is in the powei
I of Congress at this session to devise such
legislation as will renew confidence, re
vive all industries, start us on a eared
■ of prosperity to last for many years, and
; to save the credit of the nation and tin
. I 1 ™!’! 1 '”
I!*• depicts too evils arising from tin
fluctuations of the present medium of ex
change, and repeats: “It is the duty of
(’ongress to devise the method of correct
! ing the evils which are acknowledged t.
exist, and not muu-; but I will venturi
to suggest two or three things which seem
to me as absolutely necessary to return
to specie payments, the first great requi
site in a return to prosperity. The legal
tender edanse to the law authorizing the
issue of currency by the National Gov- .
eminent should be repealed, to take ef
fect as to a!) contracts.entered into after
the day fixed iu the repealing act, not t
apply, however, to the payment of sala- :
ries by the Government or for other ex
penditures now provided by law to be
paid in currency in the interval ponding
between repeal and final resumption.—
Provision should be made by which the
Secretary of the Treasury can obtain gold
as it may become necessary, from time
to time, from the date when specie re
i d‘inption commences. To this might
. and should be added a revenue sufficient
ly in excess of expenses to insure an ac
cumulation of gold in the Treasury to
I sustain redemption.”
t The President favors free banking at
I I the same time as resumption, and even
declares that they are essential to each
1 other. The President, as will be seen.
' insists upon action in relation totbecur
. rency in a rather pertinacious, if not ag
gressive manner, when wc know that the
general opinion of those “who speak by
r the card” is, that no financial legislation
. can be effected during this session.
He speaks favorably of our foreign
relations, which have been friendly dur
ing the past year with all other Powers,
j He hopes for a successful result of the
1 i pending negotiations for further opening
i j to onr commerce of the Empires of China
land Japan. He renews his recommen
dation that a special Court be authorized
| to hear all claims of aliens against the
I United States for damages to person or
: j property “during the insurrection.” He
I alludes to the progress of the survey to
• determine the boundary between the
j United States and British Possessions in
America, and states that the field work
hay been completed.
He states that the “Court of Com
, missioners of Claims” cannot possibly
complete the work before it prior to Feb
; runry, 1875, when it expires by law.
and asks an extension of the time of its
' jurisdiction.
In relation to the Cuban struggle, he
. says that “six years of strife gives the
j insurrection a significance which cannot
l>c denied," and thinks that some positive
steps should be taken in the matter.—
The questions between this Govornment
and Spain are still unsettled, but a speedy
adjustment is hoped for.
The President calls attention to the
frauds perpetrated upon the diplomatic
and consular officers of the United States
by means of false naturalization certifi
cates, and ask that legislation be shaped
to punish offenders in such eases.
The President refers to the report of
the Secretary of the Treasury, ami con
curs in its recommendations. 110 ad
vises that the tariff be readjusted, so as
to increase the revenue, while decreas
ing the number of articles upon which
duties are levied, and again pointedly
calls attention to the unwisdom of recent
legislation. In commenting upon the
Array and Navy reports, the President
suggests various improvements in those
branches of public service. 110 also re
views the report of the Postmaster Gen
eral and notes the suggestions for an
equitable adjustment of compensation t"
| railroads for carrying the mails.
Tn reference to the difficulties in tin
State of Louisiana the President explains
an J endeavors to justify his sets in re
cognising and supporting the Kellogg
Government, urnl states that unless Con
gress shall take action in the matter ho
will continue to do so. Hcalsodoelur. s
that the presence of Cnited States troops
was necessary in many portions of the
Southern States to prevent and punish
the intimidation of voters at the polls,
and denounces the White Leagues anil
other societies of that class. He says,
in reference to the Arkansas troubles,
i that he declined to interfere pending the
Congressional investigation of the mat
ter, and calmly expresses a general re
pugnance to Executive interference in
the affairs of the States. Of tie ques
tion of the difficulties between the races
he says:
‘■JjCt there he fairness in the discussion of
Southern questions, the advocates of 1> >lh nr
all jioliticul parties giving honest, truthful re
|ior;s of Oeciirrouees. condemning the wrong
end upholding tfle rijrlit. and soon all will be
well, t'nder existing conditions the negro
votes the Republican ticket because he knows
hi* f,tends are of that party. Many n good
citizen votes the opposite, not because he n
grees with the great principles of State which
separate the parties, but because generally he
is opposed to negro rule. This is a most de
lusive cry. Treat the uegro use citizen and a
voter as he is. and must remain, nnd soon par
ties will be divided, not over the color line
but upon principle. Then we shall have no
complaint of sectional interference."
He refers briefly to the reports of the
Secretary of the Interior and Commis
sioner of Agriculture, and praises the
reforms in the Civil Service, lie great
ly favors the revival vf shipbuilding,
particular) of iron steamships, and pro
poses that ample compensation for carry
ing the ocean mails he offered as tin in
j eentive thereto. The concluding por-
I tion of t’tvt Message discusses affairs in
the District, and the survey of the Mis
sissippi river.
Before a large audience of repre
sentative business men and distinguished
members of the leading professions in
Baltimore, Prof. Bonamy Price, of
Oxford T’ diversity, lectured on Saturday
evening last, in Lehman's Hall. The
learned lecturer, distinguished as one o!
the leading p ditieil economists of Kng
•and, deliverol a moat exhaustive ad
dress on the subject of Currency, and
its relation to capital. Briefly it may
be said that after explaining the origin
of currency —metal and paper —ho im
pressed his hearers with the importance
of recollecting that currency was merely
a too! of exchange. He next considered
the depreciation in value of American
currency, and strongly deprecated any
further inflation as only tending to nwj
in enabling money to be secured for
speculative purposes, and thus diverting
it from regular channels of trade. He
advocated earnestly a resumption of
specie payment at some time to he abso
lutely established by Congress. He
spoke of the presqp*. tUandul condition
of America as being such as to place her
far below the position she ought to oc
cupy in the estimation of the world.
JfcP’lt is now proposed to colonize oui
very unattractive possessions in Alaska
As they are too damp and cold for tie
ardent American temperament, they are
kindly recommended to the hardy and
phlegmatic natives of Iceland. An Ie •-
landic commission has recently prospect
ed over portious of the territory, and is
reported to declare that, though the
country may he death to the ordinary
races of people, it is a nice land for an
Icelander. Very well; we are not only
satisfied, but happy. Let them come
over, one and all. We decidedly prefer
the Norse to the Chinese immigrants as
compatriots; and there would, besides,
lie a charming romance in seeing the
same healthy hut not overwise race, wlm
were cheerful aud happy on the bleakest j
tracts of the eastern shore of the Con
tinent five hundred years befor the voy
age of Columbus, just as content in this
day to Ik* settled upon equally undcsirat
ble lands three thousand miles to the
west.
jt-t?’ It is understood that it is contem
plated by Justice f'wayne to retire from
the bench of the Supreme Court in a few
months, under the law of Congress.—
Justice Swnync, if he retires, will have
his full salary during the remainder of
his life. This will give another appoint
ment on the Supreme Court Bench to
President Grant, who has already had
the appointment of four Supreme Court
Judges, and another during his term of
office would make a majority of the
Court his appointees. Such a thing has
never happened before during the in
cumbency of any I’resident.
sl? Some important questions con
nected with the Granger movement in
the west will soon coiuc before the
Supreme Court of the C.S. for decision.
There are three cases pending, which in
volve the constitutionality of the law.-,
which are hostile to the interests of
western railroad corporations. One of!
these cases will probably be argued early j
in February.

“Tin- BK’lir.cboly liny# uri- come.

Thus ha/ii later-ilay poet befogged
the lines of f at earlier an 1 nobler poet
whose name p will not mention inasmuch
as every bojpi is supposed jjo know who
poetized tint " melancholy days " Nor
do I wish is to lw* understood that I en

aforesaid, m; “brandy-smash” I never

coolings 4 beer and do grieve some
what that | liavo to forego my mid-day

However, there is no use writing of
‘melancholy days” n<nv, for they have
eonio aud.gone. Had 1 written some |
days ago.te I would have done hut for
certain peplinr physical sensations elass
. ed under the general? designation “not
well," hoi l would have rev.-led in the
■ 'melancliidv days!" Von know it is
quite the thing. Everybody does it.—
All the newspapers are affected with it.
The dailies have leaders on the subject.
Our best b gan a leader thus:— Now
is the sea-on when then the autumn
having overpast its hey-day of splendor
arrays itself in scant and sombre ves
tures. and. its jocund fruitfulness de
parted. takes on a sober aspect: when
mists and pleasant calmness alternate
with the cild. raw winds of the North,
and sharp vicissitudes of temperature
perturb tdi * souls of those who travail
over nit iti-s of comfort, with perplexing
considerations of needs for flanu.ds and I
extra wrappings: when shortening days j

landladies grimly determine that they’ll
not be ruined in gas and coals this winter:

goes to tl 3 end of the p wind which is
about aa long again. Of course w,
eouid’nt ’ ive.(l>*R; up anything like this
but you s * how it does affect some men.
But how we would have talked to you
about withered leaves and blasted hop 's
and the awful significance of the fading
November. We would hav *sp *nt a
whole dav in -Druid Hill Park” and
“mixt
(:ir fancies with the .cillow-rifo-U gloom*
Of evening, and tile moaniii;** or the wind."
And t!u*n we would .have wandered
homo, and, mounting numberless flights
of- stairs, which might have jostled down
or j-isd - l put the harmony of our
thqugltpi, wo would have lighted our
students lamp, \vj would have seated
ourself before an open wood lire, and,
gazing awhile into the light thereof, a
, soft melancholy would have stolon over
us made luurmoniu&x by fitful gust s out
side; and then-- you be made of
stone-—we would h*c penned some lines
that—well, “The Pleasures of Melan
choly" of “Irving’s” “Poor devil author”
would’nt hove been a circumstance.—
And as the water of this poor devil’s
poem is not given to the reader, so your
imagination may work up at leisure what
our effusion would have been. Give
thanks, meanwhile, that you were spared
the agony.
But joking aside, one does feci as
though one should be in the country on
'■mi.', of the days we have had. A gun.
a ride on horseback, a listless lolling
wherever fancy may select, solitary
musing*, autumn-day reveries, not alto
; gather meaningless as some reveries are,
. but ting -J with that melancholy which
does in fact make harmony. It is such
breaks in this work-day city life which
1 gives to life itself harmony. However,
enough of this. We don’t propose to get
> sevious, nor allow this fit of melancholy
. to grow over us. It is too late in the
see* m :•> we have said. Every tiling
and every body is braced up and prepar
ing for the winter campaign, so we will
> go into the street and reflect on shops,
( women or whatever we may pick up.
The shop windows look brilliant and
i well-stuffed and the shopmen seem brisk
and lively, and this is about all that can
. bo said from a casual glance ; nor do 1
see how aiiy reflections cau be made
hereupon. But about the shop girls
some urn might grow eloquent, though
• for my part I can’t sea that shop girls
here are as much on good looks as in
some cities I have been in. One of the
. sweetest locking beings I ever saw', was
I a shop girl in Philadelphia. I wUt in
to purchase a piece of blue •ribbolf/rthd
you know how long it takes to find the
- proper shades of blue. But about all
• these shop girls, flower girls or it is as
r in the incident related by Quincy in
his “Stagecoaches in England.” You
never see them long enough at a time to
• have the charms with which you clothe
[ them dispelled by seeing them eat or
I anything <>f the sort. I wonder if
Holmes would have been so gushing
about that chambermaid if the matter of
‘ the lost key had been discussed over the
i last course at dinner instead of in a hotel
corridor. I wonder too if that relation
<*f mine who used to he such an admirer
of confectionery girls over saw that little
four-aml-a-half street girl cat. But to
return to the streets of Baltimore. The
streets are particularly the thing .it those
, periods of the day when the ladies are
out in full blast, I think Baltimore holds
its reputation for pretty women rather
from their outdoor than indoor appear
ance; though Heaven for bid that I should
• insinuate they don’t look divine on every
,j occasion. I suppose the reason is the
ladies here appear on the street so well
j and sometimes so elaborately dressed ;
| another argument in explosion of the
“beauty unadorned” theory, another
street feature is also in full glow at this
season. I allude to the mendicants crouch
ed upon door steps or standing on pro
minent comers, who with the approach
of cold snaps have an extra twang of
what is meant to be piteousness in their
tones, though I must eor.f s< this sort of
thing appeals to my sympathy very little
now-a-uays. For I note the same old
wrecks whom 1 observed winters ago in
apparently the same state of decrepitude,
aud l have long since come to the con
clusion that if they are as helpless as
they represent themselves, they should
have died long ago. There are two old
women to be found nearly every day on
Charles St., who are particularly dis
tasteful to me. One has a fearfully
bungled up foot and a carefully wrapped
hand which have to my knowledge been
in this state of careful concealment for
several years, leading one to think sin*
has n ton-penny-nail in her foot and a
darning needle in her hand. At firs!
she seemed tin object for charity, but I
passed her one day as she was counting
her pennies and halfdimes, and there
was such a look of avarice on her face
as convinced me she must be a fraud. 1
will lay a wager that woman has lots ot
money at home. The other old woman
may <*r may not be an impostor, but I
conceived a personal dislike to her.
which her new tactics leave not dispelled.
She used to have a basket of those thin
rubber balls which make a most disgust
ing infantine squeak on being pressed :
anti invariably when l passed her on my
way to dinner she would rouse herself
from her depressed posture and squeak
one of those balls at mo. accompanying
it with such jargon as you would use to
■ a three months old baby if you happon
jed to have one. That woman was the
I post of my life for a whole winter. 1
| passed her with stealthy tread and hated
1 breath, but she bomVjJ to foci my
1 presence.
But in compensation for the persistency
of these old women, wo are somewhat
relieved of hand-organs, those musical
■ nuisances or rather music murderers.—
Occasionally one comes across a good
: hand-organ well ground. I have only
mot with two hand-organs that 1 could
1 tolerate. You see lam dealing in enu
• plots. One was manipulated by a fine
; looking Italian with a brigandish look
ing hat and mustache who ground out
i some choice airs from "’ll .V nmhnr"
■ and other operss, accompanying hi:*
■ music with an occasional graceful take
> off and wave of his hat byway of let
ting you know that any favors would Ik
thankfully received. This fellow wm
an artist in his way. The other knnd
! organ was a diminutive box with a
; plaintive wail, just suited to the only air
, f ever heard from it. This was a part
. of that closing “aria* in “Lucia”
. “ Towle dryli nei miei” of course the
I thing was vilely enough done by this
music box, but it always carried me back
, to the opera as I first heard Nillson and
- Oapoul render it in the shadows of that
. Saturday matinee, and how I afterwards
f wandered around in the gloaming filled
■ with the image of that beautiful white
. robed maniac and the the lover’s mourn
• f.il melody still brooding over my soul.
1 hav’nt hoard that box for a long time.
■ and I suppose now I should laugh at
r these fancies and be very much relieved
l by kicking the cadaverous looking grin
, dor into the gutter. Eos.

A Dangerous Counterfeit.
• Attention is called to a new and dan
-1 gcrous counterfeit, of which quite a large
j number have appeared in circulation
} within a few days. It is a close inrita
- tion of the issue of the five dollar bill of
• the Traders’ National Bank of Chicago.
1 The entire bill is liable to deceive even
1 an expert at the first glance, and those
1 who receive bills of this bank would do
• well to examine them with reference to
I the following description of the differ-
once between the true and the count? r-
L ‘ feit. 1,-uiler the letter “(V’ in the word
- “Chicago” on the face of the counter
‘ feit not;*, the last shade line runs into
the top of the first letter in the word

' I the right-hand end of the words “live
j | dollars.” iu the body of the note, the
I I numerals “6” and “5” come closely to-
1 ‘ | gether. In the counterfeit there is a
s ! much wider space. The panels in the
II border surrounding tin* face of the
s genuine note have numerous marks of
ri the drapery. In the counterfeit the
0 marks ore fewer and less distinct. On
> the reverse of the note the most distinc
tive point of of difference between the
counterfeit and the genuine appears in
the lathe work enclosing the figure “5”
1 at the lower right and left-hand comer
j of the note, the eccentric circles being
11 1 nearly round and very distinct in the
‘ j counterfeit, and much more eccentric
"land less dear in the genuine. The
e | kneeling figures iu the lefthand < f the
vignette on the back of the note are
1 j much less distinct than iu the genuine,
and the work generally is coarser. The
paper upon which the note is printed is
