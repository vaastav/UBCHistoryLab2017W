ins Congress to admit that I erriiory into the

t
Indications warrant the expectation that the
war will be panned ahead with more vigor, both
by land and sea. Congress shows a determina
tion to walk right into tbe merits of the sobj-ct.
If soitaioed by the pri-tiJetit a id bis eiliiipt,

details, withiu thirty dyt, it will bi apparent
that there is to be oo backing down policy, or
tampering with rebels about compromises, or
reference to foreign powers ; bol a girding ou
of tbe armor for the mighty issue. Now i the
'time to strike, when the national heart beats
with intense desire for action. Tbe noble spir
it manifested by Congress indicates the seuti
merits and will of the people. Unlike the pre.
indent and tbo enhinot, who have been necessa
rily shot up in Washington, attending to tbe
constant cal's of duty, therefore cut off from

Tho corraspindenca iuif with the uaual

I vent are to bop that it will appear that

the public defences on every ni ie, while un-
dr this gei.eriil rcnnmendation, provisiou
for defandsng our cast itna road.ly occurs
to tbe mind.
I also, io tbe same connection, r.&k tbe
attSjtilicn of CiTgret to our great Inkes and

uons and ddpoU of arms and munitions,
with harbor and navigation improvements.

and preservation. I ak attention to tbe
views of thft Socretary of Warexpreaaed in

I deem it of irnportHOCO lhat tbo loyal

North ' Carolina should bo connected with
Keutucky aod other faithful parts of the
Union by railroads. I, therefore, reooin
mend as a military measo.ro that Congress
provides for the construction of such a rail
road as spedily as posmbla.

lion of the supplies which will remain after
satisfying the claims of American . citizen

If boweyer, it should not be deemed ad

The operations of the Treasury during

The patriotism of tba pvin'e has p1scd
at the di-posal of th G wernment the large

Much of the National Loan has been taken
by the cit 2:ns of tho ' industrial classes,

8-al for thotr country's de'ivaranoe from its

This fact imposes peculiar obligations to

recommendation for increasing the corps of

By mere omission, I presume Congress
has foiled to provide Chaplains for. the
Hospitals occupied by Volunteers.
This sul j-'ct was brought to my notice

Supreme Judges be relieved from circuit
duties, and Circuit Judges provided for all

cult Courts, leaving the judicial functions
wholly to the D. strict Courts and an inde
pendent supreme Court. . ,
I respectfully recommend to the cnns-Me
ration of Congress tbe present condition of
the statute law, with a Hope that Uongress
will be able to find an eay remedy fir tho
many ine mveniences and evila which con
stantly ombarass tb'ie engaged in the prac
tical administration of them.
Since the organization of the Onvern
ment, CongresH tin eoac'ed some 6000
acts and j mt rsolutions which will mak
more than (J000 closely printed page and
are scattered through many volumes.
vlany of those acta have b.'Wn drawn, in
.haste and without sufficient caution, so that
their provisions aro often obscure in them
selves, or e.rfl Ct with csoh other, or at
least so doubtful as to render it very difficult,
for even the bst informed persons, to as
certain precisely what the statute law really
is. Ii seems to me very important that tho
statute law should be made at plain and in
telltgabla as possible' and be reduced as to
email a compass as may be consistent with
the fullneas and precision of ihe will of the
legislature, and the pers-picuitv of its lan
guage. These well douo would, I think,
gr. sV.'j facilitalo. tho Lib r of those wi ose
duty it is to asdst in Ihe administration of
tho iawa, and wculd be a lasting benefit to
tho people by placing them in a more ac
cesa'ble and inlelligable form, the laws
which so deeply concern their inU'reits and
duties.
I am informed by some, whose opinion I
respect, that alt th'acts of Congress which
are in foice, and of a permanent and gene
ral nature, might be revised and rewritten,
so as to be embraced iu one volume, or at
loast two volumes, of ordinary .and con
venient six", nod I respectfully recommend
to Congress to consider the sutler, and if
my suggestion be approved, to devise such
plan as to their wisdom shall seem most
proper for tbe attainment of tbe end pro
posed : i . ,v ' -. ;
Una of tbe unfavorable consequences of
tba present insurrection ia the entire sup
piession in many places of all ordinary
means of administering jusUca by the oui-
cers, and iu . the f rros of existing law.
This is the CAe in whole or iu part in all
the insurgent States and as our armies ad
vance upon and take pvaseioa . of thoto
States, the praclieal - evil, becomes more ap
parent, i, : ; : - .
. There are no court or officers to whom
the citizens of other Slates may apply fr
the enforcement of their lawful - claims
against citizens of the insurgent States, and
there is a vast amount of debt, constitu
ting such claims. &ino have estimated it
as high as $200,000,000 due in large part
from insurgents in open rebellion to loyal
citizens, who aro even now making great
sacrifices in the discharge of their patriotic
duty to support the Government. Under
thoe circumstances I have been urgent'y
solicited, to establish by military puwur,
courts to admiuister summary justice in
such cases.
1 bave thus far declined to do it, not be
cause I had any d mbt that the end pto.
posed fir the collection of debt was just
and right in itself, but because I have been
uawiiling to go beyond the pressure of no-cs-dty
- io tho unusual exerciae pf power,
but the powers of Congress I supposed
were equal to the anomalous occasion, and
therefore, I refer tbe whole matter to
Congress with the hope that a plan may

ia itself, ami ho exi mively niitl iulri-
i'lv conaeoted with lha milon.-il prosperity of
worio.
Through ihe Secretaries of State and In
terior a plan or system has been devised
nd partly matured which will be laid be
fore you, under and by virtue of the Act of
Congress, entitled an Act toomSscata prop
erty usd for insurrectionary purposti,
approved Auj, C. 18t3l. Legal clai ns of
certain persona have bee ime forfeited nn'd
members of the latter thus liberated are al
ready dependent tm th-t TJrtiteJ S'ates, and
VDust be provided for in some way. - Be
sides this, it U not impossible that some of
tbe States will pass similar - ena- tments for
their own benefit respectively, and hy the
oporatiou of whioh parsons of the same
class will be thrown upon ihem for disposal.
such case I reeo-nmend that Congress
provides for accepting such persons Iroui
such States, Bcoording to some ' mode of
valuation in lieu pro i-into of direct taxes,
up-rvn some other plan to be agreed on
by suoh States respectively, that such per
sons on such acceptance by the General
Government be at once deemed free, and
that in any vent hteps be taken for olo
mzing both classes, or the one first mention
ed, if the other shall not ba brought into
existence at some place or places, in a cli
mate oongenial to them. It might be well
to consider, too, whether the free colored
people already in the United States could
not, ho far as ii dividual may desire, bo in
cluded in such colonization may involve the
acquiring of territory and also the appro
priation of money beyond that, to be ex
jended in the territorial scquisition. Hav-
ling practiced the a-qnis don of territory f r
nearly liity ears, tbe question of Constitu
luiial power to do fco is to h i gtt en opeu
one witti us. .
Ihs power was first questioned Mr. JrfF

uieut caunol be perpetual.
In considering lha policy to be adopted
fr 8m,prasiig the insurrection, I have
beeu anxious and careful that the inevitable
conflict for tLie purpose shall not degenerate
into a violent aud reujoreeloiS revolutionary
btruggla. -
I have, therefore, in every case thought it
prer to keep the integrity of the Union
pre-emineut, as a primary object of the con
test ou our part, leaving ail qu stions which
are not of vital military importance, to the
more deliberate action of lha legislature.
Io tbe exercise of my bost discretion, I
have adhered to tbe blockade of the ports
held by the insurgents, joxtoad of putting
in force by proclamation the law of Cou
gress, enacted at the late session, for closing
those ports; also, obeying the dictates of
prudence, as wall as lbs obligations of law,
lustead of trauaceuding, I have adhered .to
the act of Congress to confiscate properly
used for insurrectionary purposes. :
If a new law upon the same subject shall
be proposed, its propriety will be duly con
sidered. THE UNION MUST BE PRE
SERVED! aud henoe all dispeusble means
must be employed. We should notbe in
baate to determine what radical and ex
treme measures, wh'di may reach the Joial
as well as the disloyal, are indispensible.
Tbe inaugural address at the begitiuing
of the a linuiis ration, aud the message to
Congress at tho late special session,, were
both mainly devoted to tba domestic contro
versy out of w bicb the insurrection and
iDsequsnt war have - sprung. Nothing
now occur to arid to or subtract froip the
principles or general purposes stated and ex
pressed iu those documents, .. . , ,
Tue last ray uf hope for prescj-viog tbe
Uuion peaceably expired at the assault upon
Fort tSuuater, aud a general review of what
has cecured since may oot be unprofitable..
t WlirU was painfully uncertain thou, Is
reach better Jeliiied,nd more distinct now
and th progress of events is plainly in tbe
right direction. The insurgents confidently
claimed a strong support from lorth Mason
and-Dixon's line, ' and the friends of the
Union were not free from apprehension on
this point. This however, was soon Bellied
definitely and on the right side. Sonti of
tbe line noble liltle Delaware led otf right
from tho first. Maryland was made to
seem against tho Union. Our soldiers wore
assaulted, bridges were burned, and rail
roads torn up, within her limits, and we
were many days, at one limo," without the
ability to bring a single regiment orer her
soil to the Cnpitol Now bef bridge aod
railroads are repaired and opeued to tbe
Government. She already gives seven reg
iments to tho cause of the Union, and none
to her enemy and her people nt a regular
olection have sustained ibe Union by a large
aggregate vote than they ever before gave
to any candidal", or any question -
Kentucky loo, for some tine in doubt, is
now decidedly and I think unchangeably,
on the side of the Union,
' Missouri is comparatively quiet, and,!
believe cannot ugam be overrun ,hy the in
surgents. M ' .'..-.
These ihrre Ptatep, Maryland, Kentucky
and Missouri; neither of wbich would prom
ise a sipgla soldier at first, have now an ag
gregate of not e than 40,000 iu the field
for tho Union, while of the r cit zens not
more than a third in number are among
the insurgents, and they of doubtful where
abouts and ex'sterco. - . : , .
After a somewhat protracted struggle of
months, winter closea on tbo Uuion people
of Western Virginia, leaving them masters
of thotr own omntry. An insurgent force
of about 1,500 for months dominating the
narrow penmnula region conatitnting the
counties of Accomac and Northampton,
and known as the Eastern SJiore ol Vir
ginia, togother with some contiguous parts
of Maryland, bave laid down their arms,
and the people there bave renewed their al
legiance to and accepted the protection of
the old flag. 1 '
This leaves no armed insurrection North
of the Potomnc or East of the Chesapeake.
Also we have obtained a footing at each of
the isolated points on ihe Southern ' coasts
Ilalteras Port Royal, Tybeo Island, and
we likewise have some general accounts of
popular movements in lathaif of the Union
iu North Carolina aid Tennessee. .
Ttiose things demonstrate that the cause
of tho Union is advanoing steadily south
ward. Smca your lal a Ij lurfimint Lt. General
Scitt has retired from the bead of the ar-
my. During his long life the nation bas not
been unmindful of bis merit, yet on calling
to mind bow faithfully, ably and brilliantly
be bas served the country from a time fnr
back iu our history, when frw of the now
living bad been lorn, and thet ce forward
continually. I cunnot but' think that we
are tti I bis d btor. I submit iher fore, for.
your consideration what further mark of re
cognition ie due tobim and ourselves as a
gmtef.ll. , , .,
With lha retirement of Gen. Scott came
the executive duty to appoint in bis stead, a
General in chief of the army. It is a fortu
nate circimstanco, that neither in council or
country was there ao far that 1 know any
d ff reucebf opiuion as to the proper to be
selected. Ihe retiring chief repeatedly ex
pressed bis j idment iu favor of Gen. Mc-
Jlellan for ite position, and in tbia ,the na-
nou seem to give a unanimous concurrence.
The designation f Gen. McCellnn is there
fore in a considerable degree tho selection
of ihe country as woll as one of the execu
tive, and hence thero is belter reason to
hope that there will be given him the confi
dence and cordial support, thus by fair im
plication promised, aod without wbich he
cannot with so much efficiency secure the
Country. . " - ....,
; It has been said lhat one bad General is
belter than two good ones, and the same is
true if taken to mean no more than that an
army is belter directed by a single mind,
though thut I e inferior than by two supe
nur ones at variance and cross purposes,
and the same is true in all joint operations
wherein those eogagd csn bave none but
a common end ic- view and can differ only
as to tha choioa of means. In a storm on
sea no one on board can wish the ship to
sink, and yet not unfrequeully not all go
d-iwo together, because too many will direct
and no single mind cin ba allowed to con
trol. It continues to develop that the insurrec
tion is largely, if not exehisivety,a war upon
ihe first principle of popular government
the rights of the people. ' Conclusive evid
ence of this is to ba found in the m st grave
and mature considered documents, as well
as in tbe general tono ot the insurgents. Iu
these documents we find the abridgement
of tba existing right of S'lftrage, and tbe de
nial to the people to participate in the se
lection of public o(hcrs, except tbe legisla
tive body, advocated with labored argument
to prove lhat the Urge control of the gov
eriiuisnt in the people is the source of all
political evil.
In my present position I oitild ' soarcsly
be jushfisd were I to omit raisin a warning
voice against this approach of returning des
potism. It is not needed, not fitting here,
that a general argument should be made in
favor of popular institutions, but there is one
point with its connections, nt so hackney
e i as most others, to which I ask brief at
tention. It is the efi' rt to place capital on
an equal footing with, if not above labor in
the structure of government. It is assumed
that labor is available only in connection
with capitv), that nobody labors unless
Boiiit boily else owniug capital, somehow hy ihs
use of It, induces hiiu lo lalmr. This awuiurd .it
is bsxt conanlt-red whether it ia heat that capital
shall lure laborers, asd induce lliera to work by
ihrir owa, oyBaeut, or buy Idem, or eriv thero lo
it without iheir consent. Having pivs-eoed ao
fur, it is as'nrally ei'Bclii1eJ that all laborrs are
either in red JuWorri , or what we rail slave, asd
fun her ,11 is assumed lhat whoert r is t ee s hired
laborer is lised in that snaditioa tor life. Now
there is bo snsh relalios Itelweet capital sad la
bor as ia assumed. nr is lher asy suchlbiaK as
a freemaa beisg fixed fnr life is a eoaditioB of a
hired laborer. Bih of tkesw aesumptioB are
fah-e aod all ialereaoea from I he is gnraadlea.
Labor is prior 10 apd isdepeailpBt nf capital,
Capital is ouly the t-tfort ot lalr, aad could se
ver have existed il labor had sot tir.l existed.
Labor is Ihe superior ot capital, and Oeservea the
bigheat awatderatioB. Capital has ita rights
winch areas worthy ot proieetmu as any ot er
right. Nor is it deemed that there is aad pioba.
bly always will be a relatina betwoca labor aad
capital producing mutual benefits, - 1 ' '
T e"prrnr is ia o-numiair that the whole, btbpr
