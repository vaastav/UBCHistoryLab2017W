The Annual Message
Of President of the United
States,
States, As Communicated to the Forty-Sixth
Congress,
Touching Upon Universal Suffrage,
Universal Education,
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM, COMPETITIVE
EXAMINATIONS,
And Our Amicable Relations With Foreign
Governments.
Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House oj
Representatives:! congratulate you on tlio
continued and increasing prosperity of our
country. By the favor of Divine Providence
we have been blesBod, during the pant year
with health, with abundant harvests, with
profitable employment for all our people, and
with contentment at home, and with peace and
friendship with other natiouB.
The occurrence of the twenty-fourth election
of Chief Magistrate baa afforded another op
portunity to the peoplo of the United States to
exliibit to the world a significant example of the
peaceful and safe transmission of the power and
authority of government from the public serv
ants whose terms of office aro about to expire,
to thoir newly chosen successors. This oxaiu
ple can not fail to impress profoundly thought
ful people of other countries with tho advan
tages which Republican institutions afford.
The immediate, general and cheerful acquies
cence of all good citizens in the rcBult of the
election, gives gratifying assurance to our coun
try, and to friends throughout the world, that
a Government baaed ou the free consent of an
intelligent and patriotio peoplo, possesses olo
tnoutsof strength, stability, and permanency
not found in any other form of government.
THE ELECTIVE FRANCHISE.
Continued opposition to the full and free en
joyment of the rights of citizenship, conferred
upon the colored peoplo by the recent amend
ments to the Constitution, Btill prevails iu sev
eral of tho late slaveholding States. It has, per
haps, not been manifested in the rocont election
to any large extent in acts of violence or intim
idation. It has, however, by fraudulent prac
tices in oonnection with the ballots, with the
regulations as to the plaoes and mannor of vot
ing, and with counting, returning, and canvass
ing the votes cast, been successful in defeating
the exercise of the right preservative of all
rights, the right of Buffrago, which tho Consti
tution expressly confers upon our enfranchised
citizens
It is the dosire of the good poople of tho
whole country that sectionalism as a factor in
our politics should disappear. They prefer that
no section of tho country should be united iu
Bolid opposition to any other section. The dis
position to refuse a prompt aud hearty obedi
ence to the equal-rights amendments to the
Constitution, is all that now stands in the way
of a complete obliteration of Bectional lines in
our political contests. As long as either of
these amendments is flagrantly violated or dis
regarded, it is safe to assume that the people
who placed thorn iu tho Constitution, as
-embodying the legitimate results of the
war for the Union, and who bolkfo them
to be wiso uud necessary, will continue to act
together, and to insist that they shall bo
oboyod. Tho paramount question still is, as
to tho enjoyment of tho right by every Ameri
can citizen who has the requisite qualifications,
to freely cast bis vote and have it honestly
counted. With thi.-i question rightly settled,
the country will be relieved of the contentions
of tho past; bygones will indeed bo bygones,
and political aud party issues with respect to
economy and efficiency of administration, in
ternal improvements, tho tariff, domestic tax
ation, eduaetion, finance and other important
subjects, will then rueoive their full share of
attention; hut resistance to, and nullifica
tion of, tho results of the war will unite
together iu resolute purposo for their
.support all who maintain the authority
of the Government and the perpetuity
of tho Union, and who adequately appreciate
tho value of the victory achieved. This do
tennmation proceeds from no hostile senti
ment or feeling to any part of the people of
our country, or to any of their interests. The
inviolability of the amendments rosts upon the
fundamental principle of our Government.
They are the solemn expression of the will of
tho people of the United States.
THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT.
The sentiment that tho constitutional rights
of all our citizens must be maintained, does not
grow weaker. It will continue to control the
Government of the oouutry. Happily, the his
tory of the late electiou shows that many parts
of the country where opposition to the Fifteenth
Amoudnieut has hitherto prevailed, it is dimin
ishing, and is likely to cease altogether, if firm
and well-considered action is taken by Con
gress. I trust the House of Representatives
and the Senate, which have a right to judge
of the elections, returns and qualif. ations
of their own members, will see to it that every
case of violation of the letter or spirit of the
Fiftocuth Amendment is thoronghly investi
gated, and that no benefit from such violation
shall accrue to any person or party. It will
be the duty of the Executive, with sufficient
appropriations for the purpose, to proBocuto
unsparingly all who have been engaged in de
priving citizens of the rights guaranteed to
them by the Constitution.
A POPULAR EDUCATION NEEDED.
It is not, however, to be forgotten that the
best and surest guarantee of the primary rights
of citizenship is to be found in that capacity for
jelf-protectinn which can belong only to a peo
ple whose right to universal suffrage is sup
ported by universal education. The means at
the command of tho local and Stat authorities
are. in many cases, wholly inadequate to fur
nish fn o instruction to ail who need it. This
is especially true whore, before emancipation,
the education of tho people as neglected or
prevented, in the interest of slavery. Firmly
convinced that the subject of popular educa
tion deserves the earnest attention of the peo
ple of the whole country, with a view to wise
and comprehensive action by the Government
of the United States, I respectfullv recommend
that Congress, by suitable legislation and with
Jiroper afeguards, supplement the loeft educat
ional funds in the several States where the
grave duties and responsibilities of citizenship
have been devolved on uneducated peoplo, by
devoting to the purpose grants of public lands,
and, if necessnrv, by appropriations from the
Treasury of the United States. Whatevor Gov
ernment can fairly do to promote free popular
education ought to be done. Wherever general
education is found, peace, virtue, and social
order prevail, and civil and religious liberty are
secure.
THE CIVIL SERVICE.
In my former annual messenges, I have asked
the attention of Congress to the urgent neces
sity of a reformation of the civil service system
of the Government. My viewB concerning the
dangers of patronage, or appointments for
personal or partisan considerations, have been
strengthened by my observation and exerionce
iu the Executive office, and I believe these
dangers threaten the stability of the Govern
ment. A I 'Uses so serious in their nature can
not be permanently tolerated. They tend to
become more alarming nith the enlargement of
administrative service, as the growth of the
oouutry in population increases the number of
officers and placemen employed.
The reasons are imperative for the adoption
of fixed rules for the regulation of appoint
ments;' promotions and removals, establishing
' a uniform method, having exclusively in view,
in every instance, the attainment of the best
Stultifications for the position in question,
uch a method alone is consistent with the
equal rights of all citizens, and the most
economical and efficient adininljtratiou of the
publio business.
COMPETITIVE EDUCATION.
Competitive examinations, in aid of impar
tial appointments and promotions, have been
conducted for some years past in several of the
Executive Departments, aud by my direction
this system has been adopted in the custom
houses and postoflioea of the largor cities of
the country. Iu the City of New York over
to thouB.iud positions in the oivil eorvioe have
been sabjeot in their appointment ind tenure
of place, to the o)erauon of published rules
for thiB purpose, during the past two years.
The results of these practical trials have been
very satisfactory, and have confirmed my opin
ion in favor of this system of selection. All
are subjected to the same tests, and the result
is free from prejudice by personal favor or par
tisan influence. It Becures for the position ap
plied for, the best qualifications attainable
among the competing applicants. It is an ef
fectual protection from the pressure of iinpor
tuuitv which, under any other course pursued,
largely exacts tho time and attention of ap
pointing officers, to their great detriment in the
discharge of other official duties, preventing
the abuse of the service for the mere further
ance of private or party purposes, and leaving
the employ of tho Government, freed from tho
obligations imposed by patronage, to depend
Bolely upon merit for retention and advance
ment, and with this constant incentive, exertion
and improvement.
These invaluable results have boen attained
in a high degree in the offices where the rules
for appointment by competitive examination
have been applied.
A method which has so approved itself by
experimental tests at points whore such teBts
may be fairly considered conclusive, should be
extended to all subordinate positions under tho
Government. I believe that a Btrong and
growing publio sentiment demands immediate
measures for securing and enforcing tho high
est possible efficiency in the Civil Service, aud
its protection from recognized abuses, and that
the experience referred to lias demonstrated
the feasibility of such measures.
The examinations in tho Custom-Houses and
Fostoflieea have been held under many embar
rassments and without provision for compensa
tion for the extra labor performed by the offi
cers who have conducted thoni, and whose onni
menable interost in the improvement of the
publio service has induced thiB devotion of time
and labor without pecuniary rewind. A con
tinuance of theso labors gratuitously ought not
to bo expected, and without an appropriation
by Congross for compensation, it is not praetic
ble to extend the system of competitive ex
aminations generally throughout the Civil Ser
vice. It is also highly important that all such
examinations should ;be conducted upon
a "uniform system, and uuder general
BiqTervifliou. Section 1,703 of tho Revised
Statutes authorizes the President to prescribo
the regulations for admission to the Civil Ser
vice of the United States, aud for this purpose
to employ suitable persons to conduct tho re
quisite inquiries with reference to "the fitness
of each candidate, iu respect to age, health,
character, knowledge, and ability, for the
branch of service into which he seokB to enter ;"
but the law is practically inoperative for want
of the requisite appropriation.
I therefore recommend an appropriation of
$25,000 per aunum to meet the expenses of a
commission, to be apixiinted by the President
in accordance with the terms of this section,
whose duty it shall be to devise a just, uniform,
and efficient system of competitive examina
tions, and to supervise the application of the
Bame throughout the entire civil Bervice of the
Government. I am persuaded that tho facili
ties which such a commission will afford for
testing the fitness of those who apply for
office will not only he as welcome a relief to mem
bers of Congross as it will be to the President
and heads of Departments, but that it will also
greatly tend to remove the causes of embarrass
ment which now inevitably and constantly at
tend the conflicting claims of patronage be
tween the legislative and executive departments.
THE "SPOILS SYSTEM."
The most obstacle, an provement
of the civil service, and especially to
a reform in the method of appointment and re
moval, has been fouud to be the practice, under
what is known as the "spoils system," by which
the appointing power has been so largely en
croached upon by members of Congross. The
first stop in the reform of the civil service must
be a complete divorce between Congress and
tho Executive in the matter of appointments.
The corrupting doctrine that "to the victors be
long tho spoils" is inseparable from Congres
sional patronage as the established rule and
practice of parties iu power. It cotnos
to be understood by applicants for office,
and by the people generally, tliat Roprosenta
tives a id Senators are entitled to disburse the
patronage of their respective districts and
States. It is not necessarv to rocite at length
the evils resulting from this invasion of the
Executive functions. The true principles of
government on the subject of appointments to
office, as stated in the National Conventions of
the leading parties of the country, have again
Bnd again leen approved by tho American peo
ple, and have not been called in question iu any
quarter. These authentic expressions of pub
lic opinion upon this all-important subject, are
tho statement of principles that belong to the
constitutioual structure of the Government.
It is therefore recommended that an act be
passed defining the relations of members of
Congress with respect to appointment to office
by the President, and I also recommend that
tho provisions of Section 1,7G7, and of the sec
tions following, of the Revised Statutes, com
prising the teuure-of-ofliccactof March 2, 1807,
be repealed.
Relieving that to reform tho system and
methods of the civil service in our country is
one of the highest and most imperative duties
of statesmanship, and that it can be perma
nently done only by the co-operation of the
legislative and executive departments of the
Government. I again commend the whole sub
ject to your considerate attention.
POLYGAMY.
The Mormon sectarian organization which
npholdB polygamy haB the whole power of mak
ing and executing the local legislation of the
Territory. By its control of the grand aud
petit juries, it possesses large influence over
the administration of justice. Exercising, as
the heads of this sect do, the local political
power of tue Territory, they are able to
make effective thoir hoBtihty to the law of Con
gresB on the Hubject of polygamy, and, in fact,
do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy will not
be abolished if the enforcement of the law de
jieuds on those who practice and uphold the
crime. It can only be suppressed by taking
away the political power of the sect which en
courages and sustains it. It controls now one
of our wealthiest and most populous Territo
ries. It is extending steadily into otlior Terri
tories. Wherever it goes it establishes polyg
amy and sectarian political power. Religious
liberty and the separation of Church aud State
are among tho elementary ideas of free insti
tutions. To re-establish the interests and prin
ciples which polygamy and Mormonism have
imperiled, and to fully reopen to intelligent
and virtuous immigrants of all creeds that part
of our domain which has been, in a great de
gree, closed to general immigration by intoler
aut and immoral institutions, it is recom
mended that the Goverument of the Territory
of Utah be reorganized.
I recommend that Congress provide for the
Government of Utah by a Governor and judgos,
or commissioners, appointed by the President
and confirmed by tho Senate a government
analogous to the Provisional Government estab
lished for the Territory northwest of the Ohio,
by tho ordinance of 1787. If, however, it is
deemed best to continue the existing form of
local government, I recommend that the right
to vote, hold office, and Bit on Juries in the
Territory of Utah, be confined to those who
neither practice nor npnoiu polygamy, n tnor
ough measures are adopted, it is believed that
within a few years the evils which now afflict
Utah will be eradicated.
FORTUNE BAY INJURIES.
Our relations
been those of undisturbed peace, and have pre
sented no occasion for cotceru as to their con
tinued maintenance.
Within a few weeks I have roceived a com
munication from Her Majesty's Government,
renewing the consideration of the subject, both
of the indemnity for the injiuies at Fortune
Pay, and of the interpretation of the treaty in
which the previous correspondence had shown
the two Governments to be at variance. Upon
both these topics the disposition towards a
friendly agreement is manifested by a recogni
tion of our right to an indemnity for the
transaction at Fortune Bay, leaving the measure
of Buch indemnity to further conference, and
by an assent the view of this Government,
presented in the previoUB correspondence, that
the regulation of conflicting interests of the
shore fishery of the Provincial sea coasts, and
the vessel fishery of our fishermen, should be
made the subject of conference and concurrent
arrangement between the two Governments.
OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.

joyed by all the nations , of the continent of
Kurope'has its favorable influence upon our di
plomatic and commercial relations with thorn.

of industrial property has recently been in ses

.Ministers of the United States in France and

tinues its work in Paris. I invite your atten

made in time to enable this Government to

THE SPANISH OUTRAGE.
During the last summer several vessels be
longing to the merchant marine of this country,
sailing in neutral waters of the West Indies,
were fired at, boarded, and searched by an armed
cruiser of the Spanish Government. The cir
cumstances, as reported, involve not only a
private injury to the persons concerned, but
also seemed too little observant of the friendly
relations existing for a century between this
country and Spain. The wrong was brought
to the attention of the Bpanish Government in
a serioua protest and remonstrance, and the
matter is undergoing investigation by the royal
authorities, with a view to auch explanations or
reparations as may be called for by the facts.
THE FLORIDA TREATY.
The claims against the
the Florida Trcatv with Spain woro submitted
to Congress for its action at tho late session,
and I again invito your attention to this long
standing Question, with a view to a liual dis
position of tho matter.
OUR CHINESE RELATIONS.
The provision made by Congress, at its lost
session, for the expense of the commission
which had been appointed to entor upon
negotiations with the Imperial Government of
China, on subjects of great interest to the rela
tions of the two countries, enabled the Com
missioners to proceed at once upon their mis
sion. The Imperial Government was prepared
to give prompt and respectful attention to tho
matters brought under negotiation, and the
conferences proceeded with such rapidity and
success that, on tho 17th of November last,
two treaties were signed at Pekin, one relating
to the introduction of Chinese into this country
and one relating to commerce Mr. Trescot,
one of tho Commissioners, is now on his way
home bringing the treaties, and it is expected
that they will be roceived in season to bo laid
before the Senate early in January.
Our Minister in Japan has negotiated a con
vention for tho reciprocal relief of shipwrecked
soauion. I take occasion to urge onco more
upon Congress the propriety of making pro
vision for the erection of suitable flro-proof
buildings at the Japanese Capital for the use of
the American Legation, and the Court-house
and Jail connected with it. The Japanese
Government, with great generosity and
courtesy, has offered for this tfcirpose an eligi
ble piece of land.
Iu my last annual message I invited tho at
tention of Congress to the subject of the in
demnity funds received some years ago from
China and Japan. I renew the recommenda
tion then made that whatever portion of these
funds are due to Anioricau citizens should be
promptly paid, and tho residue returned to the
nations, respectively, to which they justly and
REAFFIRMING THE "MONROE DOCTRINE" RESPECTING
THE PANAMA CANAL SCHEME.
The relations between this Governmout and
that of the United States of Colombia have en
gaged public attontiou during tho past year,
mainly by reason of the project of anintor
oceanic canal acrosB the IsthmuH of Panama, to
be built by private capital under a concession
from the Colombian Government for that pur
pose. The treaty obligations subsisting between
the United States and Colombia, by which we
guarantee the neutrality of the transit and the
aovoroignty and property of Colombia in the
Isthmus, make it necessary that the conditions
under which bo stupendous a change in the
region embraced in this guarantee should be
effucted transforming, as it would, this Isth
muB, from a barrior between the Atlantio and
Pacific Oceans, into a gateway and thorough,

chant sliips of the world should receive the
approval of this Governmout, aB being com
patible with the discharge of these obligations
on our par t, and consistent with our interosta
as the principal commercial power of the West
ern Hemisphere. The views which I expressed
in a special mossago to Congress in March last,
in relation to this project, I deem it my duty
again to prosB upon your attention. Subse
quent consideration has but confirmed the opin
ion "that it iB the right and duty of the United
States to assert and maintain euch provision

across the Isthmus that connects North and

SOUTH AMERICA DISTURBANCES.
The war between tho Republic of Chili on tin
one hand, and the allied Republics of Peru and
liolivia on the othor, still continues. This
Government has not felt called upon to inter
fere in a contest that is within the belligerent
rights of the parties as independent States.
We have, however, always held ourselves iu
readiness to aid in accommodating their differ
ence, and havo at different times reminded
both belligerents of our willingness to rouder
such services.

INTERNATIONAL SANITARY MEASURES.
In pursuance
session of CongresB, invitations have been ex
tended to foreign maritime States to join in a
sanitary conference in Washington, beginning
tho 1st of January. The acceptance of this in
vitation by many prominent Powers gives prom
ise of BueceBS iu this important measure, de
signed to establish a system of international
notification by which the spread of infectious
or cpidemia diseases may be more effectively
checked or prevented. The attontion of Con
gress is invited to the necessary appropriation!
for carrying into effect the provisions of the
act referred to.
OUR POSTAL-COMMERCE FACILITIES.
The prosperous energies of our dustries,
and their immense production of tin
BubjecU of foreign commerce, invite, and evu
require, an active devolopmeut of the wish
and interests of our people in that direction,
Especially important is it that our commercial
relations with the Atlantio and Pacific coasts of
South America, with the West Indies, and tbi
Gulf of Mexico should be direct, and not
through the circuit of European systems, anJ
hould be carried on in our own bottoms. Thi
full appreciation of the opportunities which
our front on the Paciflo Oceau gives to com
jierce with Japan, China, and the East Indina,
irith Australia and the Island groups which lit
tlong these routes of navigation, Bhould la
pus equal efforts to appropriate to our on a
Lipping, and to administer by our own capital
i due proportion of this trade. Whatever mod
i .cations of our regulations of trade and naw
Ration may be necessary or useful to meet
and direct these impulses to the enlargement of
our exchanges and of our carrying trade, I am
lure the wisdom of Congress will be ready to
supply. One initial measure, however, seems to
me uo clearly useful and efficient that I venture
to press it upon your earnest attention.
It hcems to be verv evident that the
provision of regular Bteam-postal communica
tion, by aid from Government, has been the
forerunner of tho commercial predominance of
Great Britain on all these coasts aud seas, a
greater share in whose trade is now the dosire
and the intent of our people. It is also manl
iest tnat tne etlorta or otiier European nations
to contend with Great Britain for a share of
this commerce, have been successful in propor
tion with their adoption of regular stoam
postal communication with the markets whose
trado they sought. Moxico and the States of
is nut h America are anxious to receive such
Mstnl communications with this country, and
o aid in their development Similar co-opera
tion may be looked for, in due time, from the
Eastern nations and from Australia. It is diffi
cult to see how the lead in this movement can
bo expected from private interests. In respect
of foreign postal commerce, quito as much as
iu internal trade, communication seems neces
sarily a matter of common and publio adminis
tration, and thus pertaining to government. I
respectfully recommend to your prompt atten
tion such just and efficient meoauros as may
conduce to the developmontof our foreign com
mercial exchanges and the building np of our
FINANCIAL.
The condition of the financial affairs of the
Government, as shown by the report of the
Secretary of the Treasury, is very satisfactory.
It is believed that the present financial at union
of the Uuitcd States, whether considered villi
respect to trado, currency, credit, growing
wealth, or the extent and variety of our re
sources, is more favorable than that of any
other country of our time, and has never been
surpassed by that of any couutry at any period
of its history. All our industries are thriving;
the rate of interest is low; new railroads aro be
ing constructed; a vast immigration is increas
ing onr population, capital aud labor; new en
terprises iu great number are in progress; aud
our commercial relations with other countries
are improving.

served well the purpose for which it was cre
ated is not questioned, but the employment of
the notes as paper money indefinitely, after the
accomplishment of the object for which thev
were provided, was not contemplated by the
rramers or tne law uuder whien tney were is
sued. These notes. Ions; since became like any
other pecuniary obligation of the Government
a debt to be paid, and, whon paid, to be can
celed as mere evidence of an indebtedness no
longer existing. I, therefore, repeat what was
said in the annual message of last year, that
the retirement from circulation of United States
notes, with the capacity of legal tender in pri
vate contracts, is a step to be taken in our pro
gress toward a safe and Btablo currency, which
should be acceptod as the policy and duty of
tho Governmout and the interest and Beourity
of the people.
THE SILVER DOLLAR.
the of tho paasaue of the act now in
force requiring the coinage of silver dollars,
fixing their value and giving them logal-ten-iler
character, it was believed by many of the
supporters of the measure that tho Bilvor dol
lar, which it authorized, would Bpcedily be
come, under the operations of the law, of
equivalent value to the gold dollar. There
were other supporters of the bill, who. while
thuy doubted as to the probability of this re
sult, nevertheless were willing to givo the pro
posed experiment a lair trial, witli a view to
stop the coinage, if experience should prove
that the silver dollar authorized by the bill con
tinued to be of less commercial value than the
standard gold dollar.
The coinage of silver dollars, under the act
referred to, began in March, 1878, and has
Leen continued as required by tho act. The
average rate per month to the present time has
ueen 2,Atb,i'J4. luo total amount coineu
prior to the first of November last was $72.-
817,750. Of thiB amount $47,0S4,450 remain in
the Ircasury, and only $25,703,291 aro in the
bands of the people. A constant effort has
been made to Keep this currenev iu circulation.
and considerable expense bua been necessarily
incurred for this purpose, but its return to the
Treasury is prompt and Bure. Contrary to the
confident anticipation of the friends of the
measure at tho tune of its adoption, the value
of the silver dollar, containing grains of
suver, naa not increased. During tne year
prior to the passage of the bill authorizing its
coinage, the market value of the silver which
it contained was from ninety to ninety-two
cents, as compared with the standard gold dol
lar. During the last year the average market
value of the silver dollar has been eighty-eight
and a half cents.
It is obvious that the legislation of the last
Congress in regard to ailver, so far as it was
based on an anticipated rise in the value of
silver as a result of that legislation, has failed
to produce the effect then predicted. The
longer the law remains iu force, requiring as it
does, the coinage of a nominal dollar, which,
in reality, is not a dollar, tne greater becomes
the danger that this country will be forced to
accept a single metal as the sole legal standard
of value, in circulation, and this a standard of
loss value than it purports to be worth in the
recognized money of the world.
The Constitution of tne United States, sound
financial principles, and our best interests, all
require that the country should have as its legal
tender money, botn gold and suver coin, of an
intrinsio value, as bullion, equivalent to that
which, upon its face, it purports to possess.
The Constitution, in express terms, recognizes
botn gold and silver as tne only true legal
tender money. To banish either of these met
als from our currency is to narrow and limit
the circulating medium or exebange to tne dis
paragement of important interests. The
United States produces more silver than any
other country, and iB directly interested in
maintaining it as one of the two precious met
als which furnish the coinage of the world. It
will, in my Judgment, contribute to this result
if Congress will repeal so much of existing leg
islation as requires the coinage of silver dollars
containing only 412l grains of silver, and in
its stead will authorize the Secretary of the
Treasury to coin silver dollars of equivalent
value as bullion, with gold dollars. This will
defraud no man, and ill be iu accordance with
familiar precedents. Congress, on several oc
casions, has altered the ratio of value between
gold aud silver, iu order to establish it more
nearly in accordance with the actual ratio of
value between the two metals.
MILITARY POSTS.
The rapid extension of the railroad system
west of the Mississippi River, and the great
tide of settlers which has flowed in upon new
territory, impose on the military an entire
chango uf policy. The maintenance of small
posts along wagon aud Btago routes of travel is
no longer necessary. Permanent quarters at
points selected, of a more substantial character
than those heretofore constructed, will be re
quired. Under existing laws, permanent build
ings can not be erected without the sanction of
Congress, and when soles of military sites and
buildings have been authorized, the moneys re
ceived have reverted to the Treasury, and
could onlv become available through a new
atinronritttiou. It is recommended that provi
sioii bo made, by a general statute, for the sale
of euch abandoned military posti and buildingB
as are found to be unnecessary, and for the ap
plication of the proceeds to the construc
tion of other poBts. While many of the pres
nnt nosts are of but slight vaiue for military
purposes, owing to the changed condition of
the country, their occupation is continued at
groat expense and inconvenience, because they

The report of the officer in obarge of educa
tion in the army shows that there are seventy
eight schools now in operation in the army,
with an aggrogaU attitndanee of -8,806 enlisted
men aud children, 11m Secretary recommends
the enlistment of one hundred and fifty school
masters, with the rank and pay of commissary
sergeants. An appropriation is needed to sup
ply the Judge advocates of the army witli suite
able libraries, and the Secretary recommends
that the corps of judge advocates be placed
upon the same footing, as to promotion, with
the other staff corps of the army. Under ex
isting laws, the Bureau of Military Justice con
sists of one officer, the Judge Advocate Gen
eral, and the corps of judge advocates, of eight
officers of equal rank (majors) with a provision
that the limit of the corps shall remain at fonr,
when reduced by casualty or resignation to that
number. The consolidation of the Bureau of
Military Justice and the corps of judge advo
cates, upon the same basis with the other staff
corps of the army, would remove an unjust dis
crimination against deserving officers, and sub
the best interests of the Bervice.
COAST FORTIFICATIONS.
Especial attention is asked to the report of
the Chief of Engineers upon the condition of
our National defences. From a personal in
spection of many of the f ortlflcatlous rof orred
to, the SecreUry is able to emphasize tho rec
ommendations made, and to state that their in
complete and defeucolesB condition is discredit
able to the country. While othor nations have
been inoreasiug in their means for carrying on
offensive warfare and attacking maritime oitios,
we have been dormant in preparation for de
fense; nothing of importance has been done to
wards strengthening and finishing ouroasomat
cd works since our late civil war, during winch
tho great guns of modern warfare and the
heavy armor of modern fortifications and ships
came' into use among tho nations, and our
earthworks left, by a sudden failuro of appro
priations some years since, iu all stages of in
cumpletion, are now boing rapidly destroyed by
the elements.
NAVIGATION.
A comprehensive improvement of tho Missis
sippi and itB tributaries is a matter of trans
cendant importance. Geographically, commer
cially, and politically, they are tho strongest tie
between the various sections of the country.
TliOHe channels of communication and inter
change are the property of the Nation. Its ju
risdiction is paramount ovor their waters, and
the plainest principles of public interest require
their intelligent aud careful supervision, with
a view to their protection, improvement, and
the enhancement of their usefulness.
Tho channel of the Columbia River, for a dis
tance of about one hundred miles from its
mouth, is obstructed by a succession of bars,
which occasion serious delays in navigation,
and heavy expense for lighterage and towage.
A depth of at least twenty feot at low tido
should be secured and maintained, to meet the
requirements of the extensive and growing in
land and ocean commerce it subserves.
From Columbia River to San Francisco, a
distance of ovor six hundred miles, there is no
harbor on our Pacific ooaBt which can be ap
proached during stormy weather. An appro
priation of $150,000 was made by the Forty
fifth Congress for the commencement of a
breakwater and harbor of refuge, to ho located
at some point between the Straits of Fuca and
San Francisco, at which the necessities of com
merce, local aud general, will be best accommo
dated. The amount appropriated is thought to
be quite inadequate for the purpose intended.
I commend the matter to the attention of Congress.
THE ARMY MEDICAL MUSEUM.
The collections of books, specimens, and rec
ords, constituting the Army Medical Museum
and Library are of national importance. Tho
Library now contains about 51,500 volumes and
67,000 pamphlets relating to medicine, surgery
ami allied topics. The contents of the Army
Medical Museum consists of 22,000 specimens,
and are nniquo in the completeness with which
both military surgery and the diseases of armies
are illustrated. Their destruction would be an
irreparable loss, not only to the United States,
but to the world. These valuable collections
are now in a building which is peculiarly ex
posed to the danger of destruction by fire. It
is therefore oarnostly recominendod that an ap
propriation be made for a new fire-proof build
ing adequate for the present needs and reason
able future expansion of these valuable collec
tions. Such a building should be absolutely tiro
proof; no expenditure for mere architectural
display is required. It is believed that a suita
ble structure can be erected at a cost not to ex
A QUIET HINT.
I commend to the attontion of Congress the
groat services of the Commander-in-Chief of
our armies dining the war for the Union,
whose wise, firm and patriotio conduct did so
much to bring that momentous conflict to a
close. The legislation of the United States con
tains many precedouts for tho recognition of
distinguished military merit, authorizing rank
and emoluments to be conferred for eminent
services to the country. An act of Congress
authorizing the appointment of a Captain Gen
eral of the Army, with suitable provisions re
lating to compensation, retirement, aud other
details, would, iu my judgement, be altogether
fitting aud proper, aud would be warmly ap
proved by tho country.
ALASKA.
The recommendation of the Secretary of the
Navy, that provision be made for the establish
ment of some form of civil government for the
people of Alaska, is approved. At present
there is uo protection of persons or property in
that Territory, except such as is affordod by
the officer of tho United States ship Jamestown.
This vessel was dispatched to Sitka, because of
the fear that, without tho immediate presence
of the National authority, thore was impending
danger of anarchy. The steps taken to restoro
order have been accepted in good faith by both
white aud Indian inhabitants, and the necessity
for this method of restraint does not in my
opinion now exist If, however, the James
town Bhould be withdrawn, leaving the peoplo,
as at present, without the ordinary judicial
ana oununisirative autuoriiy oi organized
local government, sorious consequences might
ensue.
COALING STATIONS AT THE ISTHMUS.
Tho Secretary of the Navy has taken stops to
wards the establishment of naval coaling sta
tions at tho Isthmus of Panama to meet the re
quirements of our commercial relations with
Central and South America, which are rapidly
growing in importance. Locations eminently
suitable, both as regards our naval purposes
aud the uses of commerce, have been selected,
one on the eatt side of the Isthmus, at Chiriqui
Lagoon, in the Caribbean Sea, and the othor on
the Pacific Coast at the Bay of Golfito.
THE POSTAL SERVICE.
In 1850, the postal receipts were $8,518.-
067.40; in 1880, the receipts were $33,816,479.34.
All the inhabitants of the country are directly
anu personally interested m Having proper
mail facilities, aud naturallv watch the Voni-
office very oloaely. This careful oversight on
tne part or tne people nai proved a constant
stimulus to improvement. During the past
year there was an increase of 2,134 postoflloes,
and the mail routes were extended 27,177 miles,
making an additional annual transportation of
10,804,191 miles. The revenues of postal ser
vice for the ensuing year are estimated at $38,
845,174.10, and the expenditures at $42,475,
932, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated out
of the Treasury of $3,630,757.90.
I lie Universal I'ostal Union has received the
accession of almost all the countries and col
onies of the world maintaining organized postal
services, and it is confidently expected that all
the other countries and colonies now outside
the Union will soon unite therewith, thus realiz
ing the grand idea and aim of the founders of
the Union, of forming, for purposes of interna
tional mail communication, a single postal ter
ritory embracing the world, with complete
uniformity of postal charges, and conditions of
international exchange, fur all descriptions of
correspondence. To enable tho United States
to do its ruu snore or tms great wora, addi
tional legislation is asked by the Postmaster
GenorJ, to whose recommendations especial
attention is called.
The Bttggestion of the Postmaster Genoral
that it would be wise to eucouruge, by appro
priate legislation, the establishment of Amer
ican lines of steamers by our own citizens, to
carry the mails between our own ports aud
thoBe of Moxico, Central America, 8outh
America and of trans-Pacifio countries, is com-,
mended to the sorious consideration of Congress
THE JUDICIARY.
It is recommended that the number of
judges of the Circuit Court in each circuit,
with the exception of the Second Circuit,
should be increased by the addition of another
judge; in the Second Circuit, that two should
be ndded; aud that an intermediate Appellate
Court Bhould be formed iu each circuit, to cou
Bist of the Circuit Judges and the Circuit Jus
tice, and that in the event of the absence of
either of these Judges tho place of the absent
judgeshonld bo supplied by tho judge of one
of the District Courts iu the circuit. Such an
appellate court could bo safely invested with
large jurisdiction, and its decisions would
satisfy suitors in many cases where appeals
would still be allowed to the Supreme Court.
Thn AtnAnna iuourred for this intermediate
court wul require a very moderate increase of
the appropriations for the expenses of the De
partment of Justice. This recommendation
oommended to the careful consideration of
Congress.
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
It gives me treat Diets ure to say that our In
dkn affairs appear fa be in jnore Jippeful oot
dltlon vm ff-Wer ETofe. - IM XuiflaDj
have made eratlfvlne progress in agriculture,
herding and mechanical pursuits. Many who
were a few years ago iu hostile conflict with the
Government are quietly settling down on forms
where 'they hope to make their permanent
homes,!buildiug houses and engaging in the oc
cupations of civilized life. The introduction of
the freighting business among them has boon
remarkably fruitful of good results, in giving
many of them congenial and remunerative em
ployment, and in stimulating their ambition to
earn their own support. Their honesty, fidelity
and efficiency as carriers are highly praised.
The organization of a police force of Indiana,
has boen equally successful iu maintaining law
and order upon the reservations, and in exercis
ing a wholesome moral influence among the In
diana themselves. I concur with the Secretary
of the Interior in the recommendation that the
pay of this force bo increased, as an induoeaient
to the best class of young men to enter it
Much care aud attention has been devoted to
the enlargement of educational facilities for
the Indians. The means available for this im
portant object have beon very inadequate. A
few additional boarding-schools at Indian agen
cies have been established, and the erection of
buddings has been begun for several more, but
an increase of the appropriations for this in
teresting undertaking is greatly needed to ac
commodate the large number of Indian ahild
ren of school age. The numbes of Indian pu
pils at the Normal School at Hampton, Virgin
ia, under tho direction of General Armstrong,
has been considerably increased, and their pro
gress is highly encouraging. The Indian school
established by the Interior Department in 1879,
at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, under tho direction
of Captain Pratt, has been equally successful.
A similar BChool was established this year at
Forest Grove, Oregou, for the education of In
dian youth on tho Pacific coast.
Thi) expenses of Indian education have bo
far boen drawn from the permanent civilization
fund at the disxsal of the Department of the
Interior; but tho fuud is now so much reduood,
that tho continuance of this beneficial work
will iu the future depend on Bpecifio appropri
ations by Congress for the purpose, and I ven
ture to express the hope that Congress will not
permit institutions so fruitful of good results,
to polish for want of means for their support
The past year has been unusually free from
disturbances among the Indian tribes. An
agreement has been made with the U tea by
wliich they surrender their large reservation in
Colorado in consideration of an annuity, to be
paid to licm, and agree to settle in severalty
on certain lands designated for that purpose, as
farmers, holding individual title to that land
in foo-Bimplo, inalienable for a certain period.
In this way a costly Indian war has been avoid
ed. The conduot of the Indians throughout
the country, during the post year, with but few
noteworthy exceptions, nas been orderly and
THE PUBLIC LANDS.
A large increaso is roported in the disposal
of public lands for settlement during tho past
year, which marks the prosperous growth of
our agricultural industry, and a vigorous
movement of population toward our unoccupied
lands. As this movement proceeds, the oodifi
cation of our land laws, as well as proper leg
islation to regulate the disposition of publio
lands, become of more pressing necessity, and
I therefore invite the consideration of Con
gress to the report mado by the Publio Lands
Commission, which were communioated by me
to Congresa at the last session. Early action
upon this important subject ia highly desirablo.
The attention of Congress is again asked to
tho wasteful depredations committed ou our
public timber lauds, and the rapid and indis
criminate destruction of our forests. The
urgent necessity for legislation to this end is
now generally recognized. In view of the law
less characters of the depredations committed,
and the disastrous consequences which will in
evitably follow their continuance, legislation
has again and again been recommended to ar
rest the evil, and to preserve for the peeple of
our Western States and Territories the bmber
needed for domestic and other essential uses.
MINING INTERESTS.
The consolidation of the various geelsgical
and geographical surveys and exploring enter
prises, each of which has heretofore operated
upon an independent pita, without concert,
can not fail to be of great benefit to all thoBe
industries of tho couutry which depend upon
the development of our mineral roeourees. The
labors of scientific men, of recognizedmerit,whp
compose the corps of the Geological Survey;
during the first season of their field operation!
and inquiries, appoar to have been comprehen
sive, and will soon he communicated to Con
gress in a number of volumes. The Director
of the Survey recommends that the investiga
tiona carried on by his bureau, which, so far,
have been confined to the so-called publio land
States and Territories, be extendedover the en
tire country, and that the necessary appropria
tion be made for this purpose. This would be
particularly beneficial to the iron, ooal and
othor mining interests of the Mississippi Valley
and of the Eastern and Southern States. The
subject is oommended to the careful considera
tion of Congress.
MORE PUBLIC BUILDINGS WANTED.
The Secretary of the Interior asks attention
to the want of room in the publio buildings of
the capital, now existing aud in progress of
construction, for the accommodation of the
clerical force employed, and of the publio
records. Necessity has compelled tho renting
of private buildings in different parts of the
city for the location of publio officeB, for
which a large amount of rent is anuuidly paid,
while the separation of offices belonging torthe
same Department impedes the transaction of
current business. The Secretary Biiggests that
the blocks surrounding Lafayette Sqnare on
tho east, north, and west, be purchased as the
sites for new edifices, for tlie accommodation of
tho Governmout offices, leaving the square it
self intact; and that, if such buildings
were constructed upon a harmonious plan of
architecture, they would add much to the beau
ty of the national capital, and would, together
with the Treasury aud the new State, Navy,
and War Department bnilding, form one of the
most impoBing groups of publio edifioos in the
world.
COMMISSIONER LEDUC, SUGAR AND HIS TEA.
The Commissioner of Agriculture expresses
the confident belief that his efforts in behalf of
the production of our own sugar and tea have
been encouragingly rewarded. The Importance
of tho results attained have attracted (marked
attention at home, and have received the spec
ial consideration of foreign nations. The
successful cultivation of our own too, and the
manufacture of our own sugar, make a differ
ence of many millions of dollars annually in
the wealth of the Nation.
The report of the Commissioner asks at
tention particularly to the continued prevalence
of an Infectious and contagious cattle disease,
known aud dreaded iu Europe and Asia ae
cattle-plague, or plenro-pneumonia. The value
of neat cattle exported from the United States
for the eight mouths ended August 31st, 1880,
wsb more than $12,000,000, and neirly double
the value for the same period in 1879.
THE POTOMAC MARSHES.
In my annual moBsagos heretofore, I have
urged upon the attention of Congress the ne
cessity of reclaiming the marshes of the Po
tomac adjacent to tho Capital, aud I am con
strained by its importance to advert to the
subject. These flats emnraco au area of several
hundred aoros. They are an impe limout to
tho drainage of tho city, and sorn.udy impair
its health. It is believed that, witu this sub
stantial improvement of its river front, the
Capital would be, iu all respects, one of tho
most attractive cities iu tho world.
It should not be forgotten that tho land
acquired will probably be worth the cost of re
claiming it, and that tho navigation of tlie
river will be greatly improved. I therefore in
vite the attention of Congross to tho import
ance of prompt provision lor tins mucn uecuea
and too long delayed Improvement.
WASHINGTON'S WATER SUPPLY.
Tho water supply of the city is inadequate.
Iu addition to tho ordinary ne throughout tlie
city, the consumption by Governmout is nuces
sariiy very great in tho navy-yard, ursonal and
tlie various department, anu a lare quantity
is required for the proper preservation of the
numerous parks and tho cleanung of sowers. I
recommend that this subject icoeive the early
attention of Congress, uud that, in making
provision for an increased supply, suck means
be adopted as will have iu view the future
growth of the city.
SUNDAY RECOMMENDATIONS.
I commend again to the attontion ( f Congress
the subject of the removal, from their present
location, of the depots of the several railroads
entering the city; and I renow recommenda
tions of my former messages in beliilf of the
erection of a building for the Congressional
Library; tho completion of the Washington
Monumont, and of liberal appropriations in
support or tho benevolent, reformatory and
institutions of the District.
