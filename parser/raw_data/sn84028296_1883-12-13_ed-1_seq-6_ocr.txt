Thk colored brother seems to thrive
on soldier fare. The United States Sur
geon General's report says that the four
colored regiments in our nrmy were the
healthiest, and hud the least percentage
of sickness and of deaths from disease,
Of (lie whites 38 in each 1,000 on the
avcage were constantly under treatment
in tiie hospitals; of tiie blacks only 30 in
each 1,000. Six colored men died from
disease to seven whites. But this is
reversed iu the case of wounds, for five
colored soldiers died, on an average1, to
every three whites.
Mk. Cakmslk will be the fourth
Kentuckian to be elected Speaker.
Henry Clay was Speaker hi the Twelfth,
Sixteenth and Eighteenth Congresses;
John White in the Twenty-seventh,
find Linn Boyd in the Thirty-second
and Thirty-third. From Boyd to Car
lisle there has been a lapse of twenty
eight years, the States meantime hav
ing the honor being Massachusetts,
Mouth Carolina, New Jersey, Penn
sylvania, Indiana, Maine and Ohio.
Keifer has been the only Speaker from
Ohio, not counting, of course, speakers
ro tempore.
The enterprise of James Gordon Ben
nott and Mr. Mackcy in putting an end
to'the Atlantic cablo monopoly by their
contract to have a cable laid from Ire
land to Nova Scotia, and thence to the
United States, is generally applauded
in Europe. It is charged that the pres
ent Anglo American cable company
has lived entirely by a career of finan
ciering. It has bought up one cable en
terprise after another, and its career lias
been a continuous struggle to create an
artificial monopoly. The Bennett-
Maekey cable, when laid, will take half
of the business, and even at a reduced
rate a good percentage will be paid on
the cost.
If the choice Of Mr. Carlisle for
Speaker in the Democratic caucus Sat
urday night, bus any eigulfiance beyond
the personal ambition which entered
into the rivalry, it means that there is
a determination among members of the
dominant party iu Congress, to do
something towards lifting the burden of
taxation laid upon the shoulders of
every consumer in the country.
While the issue was tariff re
form, it is not likely that radical
measures will be adopted, but that, in
stead, the policy indicated by t" i Ohio
Democratic platform and since endorsed
by other States, will bo made the basis
of reforms which will prove, beneficial
to the country at large Toledo Font.
One of the grossest stupidities of all the
legislation on our postal affairs is that
which requires the post office in which a
letter is deposited with insufficient post
age, to open correspondence with the
person to whom such letter is addressed,
informing him that a letter awaits his
attention, on which there is due post
age to the amount general of one cent.
The Government forwards this missile
to the same destination that the letter
with insufficient postage could have
just as well been carried, and the delin
quent amount collected there, but tho
stupid law compels the payment of a
three cent postage rate by an innocent
party as a penalty for the delinquency
of his correspondent. And yet our pos
tal system is pronounced perfect!

Three colored horse thieves, who
stole a horse near Perrysburg, recently
and were confined in Bowling Green
jail, made a desperate attempt to escape,
Saturday night. They sawed open the
door that leads into the hall, and were
about to bid adieu to their quarters
when the sheriif's wiib discovered them
and gave the alarm, they had a two
foot bar of iron which they intended to
murder the person who came to lock
them in their cells. The sawing was
lone with two case knives they had
concealed about them, the sheriff took
them to their cells and chained them
to staples in the wall, and kept them
standing on their feet until 10 o'clock
Sunday morning, before they would
tell where they hud concealed the tools
with which they had attempted to
effect their escape.

The following timely suggestions are
taken from the Sewt Journal, one of
the soundest and ablest Democratic pa'
pers in the union:
Signs multiply daily that the democ
racy of Ohio intend to rebuke, so that
it will never be vepeatcd, the effort to
divide the Democratic party, to weaken
its forces, and to split it into angry fac
tional differences, and wholesale defa
mation. Democrats recognise the right
of every Democrat to aspire. . This is a
free country, and democracy .exists to
throw the doors wide open and to keep
thewav to preferment open. It does
not recognize the right of any paper, of
auv man, or any faction to nulla up
here by tearing down there. It is wil
ing to sec any man pile up his own
merits and virtues mountain high, and
on these to mount as high as he can;
but it will not allow that lie may make
of another's defamcment way aloft for
himself or others.
There it is in a nutshell. Democracy
needs all its strength, the power of ev
ery Democrat, won by service and pa
tient endeavor. It will have unity and
perfect harmony. To this end it will
allow of no such policy as pulling one
down that another may rise. It allows
that any men or the friends of any man
may build him as high as may be possi
ble, upon Ills own merits.
The business of building up a Demo
cratic faction and an official brokerage
association for the control of federal of
ficial patronage is not progressing rapidly-.
Ohio Democrats nave had several
words to say on this subject. Among
other things it has dawned upon some
minds which are not at all particular,
that nothing could be done that would
more surely prevent Ohio Democracy
from ever having any official patronage
to distribute. The defeat of bossism in
Massachusetts on one Bide, iu Virginia
on the other, ana the rebuke to the
New York governor who undertook to
tell the people who to nominate, have
had a very wholesome effect upon the
scheme for the creation of a Democratic
bossism, a Democratic machine, and a
Democratic omce uroKerage association.
.Democracy means an end ot ma
chines, of bossirm, of distributing offi
ces only to such Democrats as may be
designated by rings, politicians, and
bosses as a means of rewarding bum
mers for political services. The Demo
cratic party will not destroy one ma
chine to allow bosses and rings to set up
another. It will not allow a reign of
faction when Ohio Democracy needs all
its strength for the great work before it.
It has not strengthened the boss and
ring movement that it is guided by
those who have always given Ohio De
mocracy a back seat in national politics
and in the national councils of Democ
racy.
Purge out the lurking distemper that
undermines health, and the constitu
tional vigor will return. Those who
suffer from an enfeebled and disordered
state of the system, should take Ayer's
sareapaniia to cleanse the blood, ana
restore vitality.
MR. TILDEN'S FREE GIFT.
His Gramercy Park Property Intend
ed for tho City.
The Magnificent Property, With His
Books, to go to New York as a
Public Iiibrary.
New York, December 1. There has
been much speculation of late concern
ing the purpose of Mr. Samuel J. Til-
den in metamorphosing his comfortable
old house m Gramercy Park and build
ing an elaborate addition to it. To-day
agentleman.well known for his position
in the Democratic party, and as one of
Mr. Tilden's oldest and most intimate
friends, said to a World reporter:
Some time ago Mr. Tilden's library
began to reach such proportions that
serious encroachments were made on
the living rooms of his old house. He
had always intended to leave his books
to the city for a public library. After
much consideration he concluded that
no better site for a library could be
found than his old house, if it was only
i i -wr , .
large cnougn. xie securea tne adjoin
ing building, took Vaux, the architect.
into his confidence, and the result is
that Mr. Tilden has a handsome struc
ture, so designed that he can continue
to enjoy his old comforts and the loved
society of his books the remainder of
life. When lie goes it will be found
that the house is admirably adapted for
a library and literary institute.
"But does not Mr. Tilden expect to
live many years yet?"
"Mr. Tilden is not a fool. None
knows better than he that a man of
seventy can't last very long. It is
quite true, as Watterson says, that he
would not accept the presidency it he
were called upon to do so by every man,
woman, and child in the country."
"He lias not lost all interest in poll
tics, then?"
"No, he continues to take the deepest
interest in tne weiiare ot the country
and in the success of the Democracy.
Samuel J. Tilden is now. and hence
forth will be content to.be, an interested
spectator."
"Has he completed any arrangements
tor the transfer ot rus House and Horary?"
He has perfected all arrangements.
Under his will the Gramercy Park
house and his splendid library will be
left in trust to the city for a public li
brary. In this, to some degree, ho fol
lows the example of John Jacob Astor.
in founding the Astor Library, and of
reter cooper, in erecting the Cooper
Union. The Tilden institution will dif
fer, however, from others of its kind in
many particulars. This is known, how
ever, only to tho trustees, and I do not
think the time has yet come to divulge
the contents of the trust deed."
"Who are the trustees?"
"Three of Mr. Tilden's old and valued
friends Mr. Henry Watterson, of
Kentucky: Mr. Manton Marble, and
Mr. John Bigclow, of this city."
"Can you give mo some idea of the
value of Mr. Tilden's proposed gift?"
"He has spent about $500,000 on the
buildings, his books are worth nearly
$100,000, comprising as they do the
most extensive private library in the
country. The property as it stands is
worth i?l ,000,000. The amount of the
endowment will be ample, I assure
you."

Sank Af,r CvlliiOon With an
American Ship, i.

In Vernel Thorn an Dana.
(N. Y. RmU, le. 1.1
Just off Bedloe's Island yesterday a
big ship swung at anchor. She bore
traces of a long voyage, and sticking
from the timU-rs of her starboard bow
was the ioint of a bowsprit. The paint
about it was a trine scrntchea anil
tarnished hut there was no fracture In
the planking, and only tho name
Thomas Dana, of Boston (recalling
narrative of disaster that lias already
been noted in the Herald cable des
patches.) disclosed that the vessel was
fresh from a collision in which eightv-
nine human lives nan Iteen lost. The
Thomas Dana sails under the American
flag, and her master. Captain Sisson. is
a 01 un American sailor, who deplores an
occurrence so tragical, even though no
title of its responsibility rests uion liliu
Standing on the deck yesterday, he told
the story of this sinister happening of
the sea, of which he could only detail
the scene he witnessed. Of the person
nel of the unhappy beings who went
down before his eves he knows little or
nothing. They were all Frenchmen
poor fisherman of St. Malo for the most
part, who, after cruising about off the
Newfoundland cost for a season
trimmed their sails forborne when thev
met their fate. According to the cap
tain, the catastrophe was as sudden as it
was uniookea tor. t here was no hus
tle, little struggling in the water, hardly
any work for the boats. Such as had
not sprung for the ship's side at the first
crash were carried under the water by
the shattered craft which the one blow
had crushed.
. THE FATAL COLLISION.
It was on October 22 that the Thomas
Dana left Liverpool consigned to Snow
& Burgress, with a lightcargo of chenu
cals to Thayer & Lincoln. Tho trip was
quiet and uneventful until October 30.
On the morning of that day the ship
was in longitude 15 deg. west, latitude
48 deer, north. It was pleasant weath
er. The stars were shining up in the
sky still, but it was becoming gray over
head, and down by the horizon there
was a whitish band where day was
breaking. It was near six o'clock, and
though it would not be clear for some
time, there was light enough to see a
(rood distance on every side. Frederick
Tfaff, the second officer, was on deck.
and Capt ian Sisson had just come up to
him and was speaking about tho fine
ness of the weather when the lookout
hailed. The Captoin looked up.
"A green light to starboard!" came
down from the man.
"All right, green to green's the rule,"
said the captain and he took out his
pipe to smoke. He was looking for his
match when a sudden cry rang out for
ward and then came a bump. It was
very slight. The captain first thought
some one had thrown something upon
the deck, but as he raised his eyes he
saw a tangle ot spars ana rigging over
the starboard bow and heard a clatter
of tongues and a creaking of timbers.
He ran forward, and suddenly a fearful
spectacle was revealed. Low in the wa
ter, just under the ship's bow, was a
small brig close up to the side with her
bowsprit piercing the planking and her
(leek sloping downward to the sea. Her
rigging was iu a snarl, and all hands
had slunk down from their posts and
were swarming forward. They were a
poor, weather beaten set, with., dark
faces almost blue with terror and big,
straining eyes. Many of them were in
the water, and those who came strug
gling up went over the side. There
was no mistaking what that meant.
The brig was going down. Fearfully
fast, too; for, as the captain looked
over, she began to settle, and the poor
wretches splashing about struggled
away from her.
No molasses and water mixture, but
a concentrated extract ot the active
medicinal properties of roots, barks, &e.
is Hood's Sarsaparilla.
The President's message, so-called,
but which is evidently almost wholly
made up in this instance by cabinet offi
cers and department clerks, is about as
barren of original ideas as a bill for mer
chandise, and such parts of it as contain
original recommendations of any im
portance, to the citizens of the United
States generally, are in the-wrong. He
recommends the constitution of coast
defenses as a means of distributing a
portion of the surplus revenues. The
United States has no more need of coast
defenses than John L. Sullivan has for
a cannon in his dooryard. He recom
mends buying up the trade dollars at
snch a price that the speculators who
engineered tne raid upon the dishon
ored coin will make a profit of 15 to 20
per cent, which is certainly unjust. He
recommends the organization of militia
in the States to be under the control of
the federal authorities, a sort of nation
al guard, contrary to the spirit and
theory of Democratic institutions, and
menacing thereto. He indirectly con
demns tne idea ot a postal telegraph,
wherein he again runs counter to the
demands of the people. These subjects
concern and interest the whole people
anu are auoui tne oniy ones in tne mes
sage in which the recommendations
made are of any account and they are
wholly wrong. Mr. Arthur is evident
ly better acquainted with piscatorial
affairs than the wishes of the American
people. Penny Press.

A Republican Disappointment.
New York Herald (Ind.): If the De
mocratic leaders have energy and intel
ligence the caucus action of last evening
means a sweeping Democratic victory
next year. For tho first timo in many
years there is before the party a fair
prospect of such popular favor as they
have long been seeking by many devi
ous and false roads. At last they are on
the right track. The caucus vote will
surprise a great many people. The re
sult is a severe disappointment to the
Republican politicians, who exclaim
illogically, but loudly, that it gives
them the next presidency. But the
Republicans have one comfort -thev
gave a complimentary indorsement to
Mr. Keifer yesterday. They can never
be lonely while they have Mr. Keifer.

Some Press Points.
St. I)uis Post-Dispatch: No speaker
was ever elected by a more truly nation
al vote.
Omaha Herald: The election of Mr.
Carlisle is the most important and the
most favorable event in the history of
tne present year.
Atlanta Constitution: Editor Romeo
Reed, of Cincinnati, calls for "a consti
tutional tonic." In Ohio this means
two schooners of beer.
incennes Sun: Deacon Smith calls
the chanilcr of commerce, of Cincin
nati, a collection of d fools. The dea
con is a prominent member.
Memphis Appeal: The tidal wave on
which the present congress rode into
power meaut something, and woe to
those who prove recreant to their trust.
Pittsburg Post: It hardly consorts
with the dignity or intelligence of man
hood to go into hysterics over' Imagin
ary evus, or suggests the Aortli may be
as easily frightened from its propriety
iu irvvj as it was in ihuu.
Philadelphia Inouirer fRen.): Ex.
President Grant lies, almost forgotten
now, as a mere politician in the crave
in which the third term conspirators
ruueiy miu mm. tie is not at all the
same person as General Grant, the hero
f
oi our wars.
Steubenville Gazette: The Cincinna
ti Commercial says that Carlisle is from
the center of population of the United
States. This being true, the Commer
cial should stop its childish remarks
about the gentleman being a sectional
speaker.
Indianapolis News: Will some phil
osopher, or physiologist, or statician ex
plain why it is that but 4,831 men of the
war 1812 survive, while there are 21.3,10
widows of soldiers of that war surviv
ing? more than four times as many
women as men.
St. Louis Post-Disnatch: Tho Inlnrv
done to the business interests of the
country by the election of Carlisle is
spreading. President Alaxon, of the
Bobtail Line, will hereafter be com
pelled to pack sixtv-scven passengers on
one of his cattle cars, instead of fixing
the limit at sixty five, as heretofore.
Philadelphia Record: The neoule
who object to the selection of a distin
guished citizen of acknowledged fitness
and ability because of his locality are
UICUIOUIVCS SCCUUIUUISIH, IllOllgll tile'
do not seem to perceive it. This coun
try is too great to encourage any such
narrow minded prejudice.
Chicago Tribune: At bust accounts
Nasby of the Toledo Blade, was still en
gaged in "pulverizing the rum power."
The process, supposed to be as follows,
is simple enough: First pulverize the
lump of sugar in a little water at the
bottom of the glass, then add the rum
powder, stir well, and pulverize the
whole dose in three swallows.
Indianapolis Sentinel: Mr. Carlisle
is a very quiet gentleman, who practi
ces mostly in Ohio courts at Cincinnati.
He lives over the river about a mile
from Cincinnati. On this sort of a slen
der foundation the Republican miners
sing out "the solid South," and flop and
nutter the bloody shirt. Randall's de
feat was a Republican defeat.
Chicago Times: The sudden and un-
expected appearance of the Democratic
party as a party of principles and ideas
will no doubt be disconcerting to the
grand old party. The g. o. p., it is in
ferred, will be plunged into a very per
plexing dilemma when it comes to a
decision between taxation on tobacco
and whisky and that on blankets and
common dress goods. . ,

NEWSPAPER CHANGES.
New -Managing Editors for Three New
York City Journals.
New 10RK. Nov. 23. A number of
changes have taken place in the ner-
sonnei oisome oi tne jxew York dailies
within the past few days. Mr. Joseph
Pulitzer, of the World, has completed
his staffby placing Col. Johnny Cock
erell, who obtained his military title as
a member of the gallant staff of
Governor Allen, of Ohio, in charge
of that paper, and making Mr. C. A.
Snowdod, formerly of the Chicago
Times, and more recently of the Wash
ington Republican, Col. Cockerell's as
sistant. Having done this Mr. Pulitzer
expects to sail for Europe as soon as his
wue'8 somewhat delicate health will
permit and it is said to be his desire to
remain abroad four or five years.
Mr, E. T. Flynn, who has for some
time past represented Mr. James Gor
don Bennett as managing editor of the
Herald, sailed for Europe Wednesday
on the Arizona, and Mr. Ballard Smith
is to be hereafter known as the man in
charge of that paper.
ihe tnird newspaper change which
has occurred this week Is found in the
Iribune yesterday, as follows: "Mr.
Isaac H. Bromley, who has been for
over ten years past a valued member of
the editorial statr of this Journal, is to
assume the editorship-in-chief of the
New York Commercial Advertiser, be
ginning Monday next."
Mr. John Hastings, a nephew of the
late editor, remains in charge of it, un
der the new control. Mr. Bromlnvanc.
ceeds the following distinguished list of
editors on that paper: Noah Web

Stone, rancis Hall. -William
Henry Hurlbert, Thurlow Weed, Hugh

"May I have the honor to conduct
your daughter to the sunner-table?"

How Watch Cases an Made."
Thu' proem of manufacture iu iaTented
by James Boss, who started in business in
1854, snd the method and tools used in
making these watch cases are coTered by
patents. Thit it the only valck earn tiadt
uudrr Mis prorett. For many years the in
trwlurtiim of these goods was slow, owing
to popular prejudice against "plated" goods,
but gradually the public learned that the
Jame Bos' Gold Waie Cose was not a
thrap gold-wa$htd or electro-plaUd article,
but was made of genuine gold plait of
tiatvlard quality and tfucknci. Conscientious
adherence to the determination to make
the bait watch case ever put on the market,
and the adoption of every improvement
suggested, has made the Jame Boti Gold
Watch Gate the standard. -wsSljmj
Iii this watch case the parts & A
mobt subject to wear the bote, croicn, hinges,
thumb-catchet, etc., are made of solid GOLD.
