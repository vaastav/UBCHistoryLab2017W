GOVEBHOE SMITH, OF ALABAMA
Governor Smith, tlia defeated candi
date for Governor of Aluhania, has takon
steps to continue hiiusrilf iu office. He
. believe that his right to the oflice of
Governor lias not been destroyed or im
paired by the late election iu that State,
and that Its Hon. R. B. Lindsey baa no
yijrht to the office. A bill has been filed
in the Chancery Court of Montgomery
county by Governor Smith, the object of
which is to prevent the Hon. R. B. Lind
sey, Governor elect, from taking his seat.
Smith charges that the returns of the
election to the presiding officer of the
Senate, however valid on their face, will
he believes, be rendored wholly nnvalid
by the evidence of frauds which be has
in his possession. This is a common
plea put forth by defeated candidates, aud
is worthy of little credence, unless the
facts are clear in support of the charge.
Such evidence is entirely wanting in his
case, so far as beard from. None were
kept from the polls, either black or white
voters, nor were any amount of frauds
perpetrated, unless by the Radical party
that supported Smith. He beiug Gov
ernor of the State at the time bad the
entire civil machinery and military
power of the State to back him, and was
himself responsible for the execution of
the law. and if these were not sufficient
be had only to call upon the Administra
tion for assistance, who has ever shown
a willingness to come to the rescue of
loyal candidates in the unfortunate
Southern States. Not choosing to do
this, Governor Smith has obtained the
following injunction, restraining Mr.
Barr (Radical), presiding officer of the
Senate, from counting the vote of Gov
ernor and Treasurer:
Whereas, William H. Smith has this
day filed his bill of complaint against
you as defendant, praying, among other
things, for an injunction commanding
and enjoining you, the said K. IU. linn,
from proceeding, as the presiding officer
of the General Assembly of Alabama, to
the opening and publishing of the re
turns of the election for Gover
nor, held on the 8th day of November,
1870. in the State of Alabama, and to re
frain therefrom until the further order of
this Court; and whereas, the said com
plainant, upon proper application made
to the Hon. B. F. Saflbld, Judge of the
Supreme Court of the State, did, on the
20th of November, lt70, obtain an order
from the said B. F. Suffold, Judge as
aforesaid, commanding the issuing of
an injunction in accordauce with the
prayer of said bill upon the complainant
enU-'ring into bond, etc., and the said
complainant having filed his bond, as
required by said order, and the same
having been approved by me, now these
are to command you, the presiding offi
cer as aforesaid, the Hon. K. N. Burr, as
presiding officer of the Semite and of the
General Assembly of the State of Ala
bama, to desist and refrain from opening
and publishing the returns of the election
for Governor held on the nth of Novem
ber, 170, in the State of Alabama, until
the further order of this court, aud this
you shall in so wise omit, and this in
junction in no wise disregard, under the
penalty of the law.
Witness, J. W. IIuohsh, Register.
These are novel proceedings and of
doubtful validity, but did not act in re
nu ainiiig a majority of the joint conven
tion of botb Houses from proceeding to
count the votes for Governor, as well as
other State officers elected. The law re
quires the vote to be counted in the
presence ol a majority ol ttie Ueneral
Assembly, as was done, and not iu the
presence of a majority of each House,
as the Radical members of that body
would have. The remedy for Governor
Smith would have been to contest the
election after the result had beeu made
known by the Speaker of the Seuale,
and not to restrain him in the dis
charge of a sworn duty under the
Constitution. Some of the influential
' Republicans of the Slate do not indorse
the course of Gov. Smith, as is evi.
denced by the resolution adopted at an
indignation meeting lately held at Mont
gomery. They see in it nothing more
than civil revolution, that must fall with
terrible effect upon the Republican party.
Radicalism dies hard in the South, and
clings to life even after the breath is out
of the body of the defunct organization,
but it must yield up the ghost if the peo-
. pie have the right to govern..
FALLING FK0M GRACE.
The St. Louis Democrat, a Republi
can nutter of acknowledged influence
and dignity, was god-father and mother,
so to speak, at the birth of the Third
Party in Missouri. The Democrat had
favored the enfranchisement of the peo
ple of Tennessee, and could consistently
support the same movement in Missouri
by advocating Brown, the liberal, or
bolting candidate, for Governor. The
only issue of tbe campaign worth men
tioning was the enfranchisement of rebels
tnd rebel sympathisers. In that State
Bore people were disfranchised for their
real or supposed sympathies with the
South, than were ever in the' Confeder
ate service. By supporting Brown the
Democrat, for the time, appeared to have
cut loose from the policy of such men as
Drake and Grant, and united practically
with the Democrats and liberal Republi
cans. Brown was elected by a majority
of 42,000, and the enfranchisement of
the excluded classes is now a mere bat
ter of time and form. The Democrats
had no ticket in the field, hence they
supported Brown. The liberal Republi
cans with whom they co-operated began to
bt called the Third Party. But, like all
third parties yet formed, it Bad a short
life. The Democrat saw, kfter the elec
tion, that then waa no middle ground,
and that it must permanently coalesce
with tbe Democratic) party, or return to
the full fellowship of thr faction .in
power. It chose the latter. It virtually
admitted that there are only two parties
in the State. While enough Republicans
were dissatisfied with ihnjr party to make
up half the new party, no lemocrats
were found dissatisfied with their party.
This mournful fact drove the Democrat
back to its old party allegiance, with the
significant confession that "the present
political school of Democracy, 'Copper
head ' in all its instincts, ought to lie
down and die, tut it woR't; The Dem
ocrat revives the qusation of disfratv
chisement as an excuse, and claims that
it was right at one time; therefore the
principle is correct any time. There Is
the Doint of divergence. The Democrat
thence diverges back into the uncom
promising Radical camp. This is too
bad, after Buch fair promises; but better
to be on either side than between the
two. '
Memnhla,
From tbo Independent (Miss.) South, Deo. 1.1
This city is connected to us by all the
ties which one neighboring community
un l attached to another. The short
sightedueas of those who inaugurated
tbe location of the Memphis and Charles
ton railroad aeeming to act for the ad
vancement of the great city of Tennes
see, stimulated opposition ana anenauHi
trade which naturally belonged to Men
?!
hia. We are the friends ol .ncmpnisana
r nrosDeritv. and we want to see our
people and ber people con nected directly
by iron ligaments. We waut a railroad
from this city to Memphis.and will never
feel satisfied until the thing Is accom
plished, if we were one of the directors of
the . Memphis and Selma road, at its
meeting next Thursday at Memphis, W
would urge me impunuucc ui oun.Mf
the work at once or aa soon as money
could be raised so to do. If Memphis
and Marshall, Pontotoc, Chickasaw,
Monroe and Lownds counties, awake w
their interests, the Memphis and Selma
road would be built. - No road, except
the Little Rock road, would advauce the
commercial interest of Memphis as much
as the Selma road; when that road is
built then we will be in connection with
the inexhaustible fields of coal and iron
that is to make Alabama and her South
ern sisters independent of the North in
these great interests.
We were at a Democratic Convention
in lsis. at Jackson. Mississippi; we bad
a good time, all things went well and at
the rinse of the convention a resolution
was offered to have mine host, General,
T. C. McMackin, introduced, lie ap
peared and said: " He was a Missis
si ppian; he came to her borders naked
and she clothed him; hungry aad she fed
him; a stranger and she took him in;
that he loved her people, was devoted to
her interest, and said he was for Missis
sippi with or without onions." As he
was by Mississippi so are we by Mem
phis; we are for ber and her prosperity,
with or without "onions." Hence we
want this great feeder put in requisition
as soon as possible. ,

Habitual Constipation-How to Effect a
Cartainand Permanent Cure. Some occu
pations of life preiiispoK to Costiveness, esi
clally those which allow but little exorcise.
Persons who contract this unfortunate habit
of body, under such circumstances, migut
pouiblv bo relieved by chantrin- their seden
tary employments fur others of a more active
kind; but this is by no means certain. Habit
ual constipation is a very obstinate disorder.
All tbe ordinary so-called remedies invariably
aggravate it. Nothing can be mora injurious
than the continued use of strong aperients,
They at Urst irritate, and 6nally almost par
alyie the bowels rendering them so torpid
that enormous doses or cathartic medicines
hare no effect upon them. A mild aperient,
combined with a gentle stimulant, is the true
remedy; and a combination in the happiest
proportion, of these ingredients, is found la
Hosteller's Stomach Bitters. This famous
Stomachic invigorates tbe whole intestinal
canal, while quietly removing from its convo
lutions all impedimenta to a froe passage
through them. No mere purgative has tnis
double operation. No ordinary stimulant
effects the desired object. Cases of Constipa
tion abandoned as hopeless by distinguished
medical men hara been cured In a few weeks
by the Bittors. To those who have tried all
the medicines of the dispensary in rain, we
say try this irresistible stimulant and aierient.
There is no sufficient reason why constipation
should be the consequence of sedentary habits,
llostetter's Bitters, by supplying the vigor
which would otherwise be derived from exor
cise, will in all eases enable the system to
perforin Its excretory funotions regularly anu
healthfully. m toi
