Away In Florida,
WAS ON LEAVE OF ABSENCE.

by Administrative Committee.
NashTlll& The announcement of tfie
deata of Dr. George A. Gates, presi
dent of Flsk university. In this city,
.which occurred recently at "Winter
Park, Fla, caused -Borrow and regret
among the faculty and students, as
.-well as a distinct shock to the com
munity. A night letter message from
Mrs. Gates brought the sad news of
Ms death.
Dr. Gates resigned from the presi
dency of the university early In Sep
tember on account of ill health, and It
was hoped that rest and relief from
responsibility would Improve his con
dition. The news of his death, there
fore, Is a great shock to the school and
to his many friends In the city.
"While on his way to New York lasn,
February to attend a meeting of the
board of trustees of Flsk university
President Gates was seriously Injured
In a railroad wreck near Altoona, Pa.
He remained In a hospital In Hunting
don, Pa for two weeks before he was
able to return home.
He tried to resume his work at the
university, but It was soon discovered
that he was In no condition to assume
charge of the work, and he was given
a leave of absence, an administrative
committee being appointed to act in
Ms stead. He never fully recovered
from his Injuries, and It is believed
that his death Is directly traceable to
the shock which be sustained at the
time of the accident
The body was taken to Grinnell, la.,
where Dr. Gates was president of
Grinnell college for thirteen years.
When Dr. Gates came to the university
the very great problem confronted him
of raising an endowment for Flsk, that
institution being without an endow
ment and uuder heavy debt, which had
been accumulating for several years.
THs resignation left the school still In
a serious financial condition.
Before being Injured Dr. Gates, with
the trustees of Flsk, was carrying on a
tireless endowment campaign. Through
'his efforts encouragement had been
given by the general education board
by way of a conditional gift of ?C0,000
provided a total of $300,000 was raised,
to be expended In Improvements and
as an endowment fund, except that
which would be used in paying off the
delinquent debts of the institution.
Harvey L. Simmons, treasurer of the
trustee board of Flsk, has given his
entire time to this campaign, and, with
'his help, there has already been sub
scribed ?1S1,000, Including the amount
given by the general education board,
and It was at this most critical time of
raising the balance of this fund,
amounting to $119,000, that President
Gates was forced to resign. It is said
that a serious situation confronts the
university unless this work wMch Dr.
Gates was carrying on so splendidly
can continue to a successful end.
v Dr. Gates was born In Topsham, Vt,
Jan. 24, 1S5L He was educated at
Dartmouth, but finished Ms studies In
Germany. On his return to America
he entered the Andover Theological
seminary, from which he graduated In
1880, and was ordained In the Congre
gational ministry. He married Miss
Isabelle Augusta Smith of Syracuse,
N. Y, who survives him.
As a minister he was pastor at Mont
dalr, N. J., and later at Cheyenne,
Wyo. He entered Ms career as an ed
ucator when be was made president of
Grinnell, college, at Grinnell. IawMch
place he held for thirteen years. He
was president of' Pomona college,
Qaremont, CaL, for seven years, fin
ishing his work there in 1000, when he
was elected president of Flsk univer
sity. In Ms work in Nashville Dr. Gates
was very successful, leaving a large
circle of friends and admirers, who
mourn their losz. He was an author
at ability. A Foe to American Schools"
