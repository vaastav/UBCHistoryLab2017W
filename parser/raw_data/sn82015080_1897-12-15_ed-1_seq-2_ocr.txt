If anyone doubts that the
banks are running this ad
ministration let him read the
president's message.
J.K. Hudson is still butting
his head against a stone wall
by fighting Cy Leland boss
ism. Bossism and republican
ism are inseparable.
If you accept the silver dol
lar lor 100 cents you favor
free silver and fiat money.
You may not admit this to be
a fact but your action con
clusively establishes it.
The rank and file of all
parties have become tired of
bossism and are beginning to
put their fighting clothes on.
Thank the Lord for that much
enlightenment.
If congress follows the re
commendations of the presi
dent, may the good Lord have
mercy on the people; for then
surely will they be in the
hands of the devil and his
angels on earth.
Attorney General Boyle
is winning a case about every
week in having measures
passed by the late Populist
legislature sustained by the
courts. Mr. Boyle is an at
torney who has already ac
quired national fame.
We have McKinley's word
for it that if the gold reserve
falls below $100,000,000 a
bond issue will follow. Our
republican friends will now
please cease all further deni

Whenever all the reform
elements get together on a
broad and sound declaration
of principles the republican
party will be defeated but
not before. The word "all" in
eludes Populists, free silver
democrats, social democrats
and socialists.
The directors of the Ameri

have declared a dividend of 3
per cent on the common and
1 3-4 per cent on the prefer
red stock. Every man, wo
man and child in America
helps to "put up" these enor

Populist papers which club

in poor business. The metro

lily Jaiute VTa'ter C! u t In 'The Now Time."
Tvery s. has Us special vices es
well a? its spttial ri-ijious develoj -m:r.t.
T be put centuries were cfte;i
marked by threat tame, aud sometime:;
great ft tuiics acquired by military
triumph j. i.u. there at least was this
redeeming feature that th dwspoilers
had the manhood to risk their lives and
persons on the battle-field. This age
is marked by the accumulation. of still
vaster fortunes, but it is done without
personal risk, without heroism, by the
wholesale deprivation and spoliation of
the masses of the people the creators
of tins wealth in the interest of a tew
combinations of capital.
Do you think that if Christ came to
day He would be belter received in this
so-called Christian age and land
than Ibi was in Judea nineteen centu
ries ago? Remember that lie was a
carpenter and His apostles were poor
laborers and fishermen. Suppose some
obscure carpenter, in this day and gen
eration, accompanied by such compan
ions, should go about the country de
nouncing the robberies of the rich and
corruption In high places; suppose he
should say that salvation could only be
had by believing in him and that It was
more possible for a camel to pass
through the e.ve of a needle than for a
rich man to enter the kingdom of God;
suppose such a one should enter your
rich churches, where the preacher, re
dlining on soft cushions, offer incense
tnd adulation to the millionaire bond
holders, gorged with the wealth they
have illegally wrung from the people,
and with hi3 knotted cord should
scourge those ministers and those wor
shippers of Mammon from these tem
ples erected to God, how would he fare?
Suppose he should teach the Daked gos
pel as Christ taught it, that wealth con
fers no privilegesbut imposes great
duties and responsibilities. Suppose
further that when these men who daily
rob a whole people of their just earn
ings shall be wont to give a hundred
dollars here, a thousand yonder, a mil
lion to this hospital, two millions to
yonder college, and every time they
thus give back a small part of their
stealings they should cause every news
paper in the laud to proclaim their
magnificent generosity, and that this
obscure carpeuter, with his barefooted
followers, should denounce such hypo
crites.as he of Nazareth did those in his
day, who, in like manner, when they
gave their alms, had a trumpet blown
before them; aud suppose that obscure
man who was no respecter of persons
had aroused their tears as well as their
hate by his miracles, which 6hould
cause the corar .on people to hear him
gladly, and w: at, I ask, would this
generation do to such a man? If it did
t ot crucif; him, it would be only bt--
r.se of the miliits.ee of his teaching,
which in the l.ose at n neteen centu
ri ;3 h.iva giver, the ua .sse3 a power
they did not possess iu Judea. Ti.f
millions ires sud their tools, the preach
ers that worship them; t,he papers,
whether church or socul?-, that defy
them, and all., the oth?r followers of
Mammon would hate Christ, as those
other rich men hated Him in the coasts
of Jordan and Galilee nineteen centu
ries ago and as they today really hate
everyone who truly teaches His sayings
in their purity. If the rich syndicates
aud trusts and other robbers cf the
people of this day and their toadies and
beneficiaries were not allowed to cru
cify Christ they would wish to do it.
They would surely hale him Into piisou
and denounce Him and His followers
as anarchists, socialists, and commu
nists. Is not this true-, men and brethren?
If Christ came today, who would re
ceive, and who would crucify Him?
Have you ever thought about It? The
pure-minded little children would re
ceive Him. They did so when He came
nineteen centuries ago. "Suffer little
children to come unto me for of such is
the kingdom of heaven." Then the
good women of this land would gladly
receive Him. And so they did nine
teen centuries ago.
"Not she with tratt'rous kiss her Master stung.
Not she denied Him with unfaithful tongue.
She, when apostle fled, could danger brave,
Last at His cross aud first at His grave."
There are dancing daughters of He
rodias and other women wrapped up in
self and the deceitf ulness of riches now
as then, but now as then all good wom
en would gladly follow Him. And
then among the men He would recruit
Ills followers just as of old, for "the
common people heard Him gladly."
They whose faces are darkened by the
searching glances of the sun aud their
hands hardened by toil would figure
largely among His followers. And so
would the honest men of whatever pro
fession and whatever calling who are
striving for modest competence and in
wnose Hearts the greed or gold has not
burnt out all tiaces of humanity and
fair dealing and of "tbatdivinity which
should be within us." But not many
mighty nor many rich shall be called.
It was so of old. They who form great
s) iidicats aud trusts to rob the people
and they who gather where otheis have
sown, would be foremost among those
who would crucify Him. For it was
lie who said it and we know that His
saying is true that a rich man can no
more enter into the kingdom of heaven
than a camel can pass through the eye o!
a needle. Thi. saving miy offend some.

THE MESSAGE.
Pres5dentJcXinley,s message strikes
a responsive chord among bankers aud
capitalists generally. In dealing with
the currency problem, he advises, in
substance, that the greenbacks be re
tired and the powers of national banks
be enlarged. He recommends that
authority be given by act of coneress
for the establishment of national banks
with a minimum capital of ?25,0C0,that
they be allowed tfo issue bank notes to
the face value of the bonds deposited
In the treasury and that the tax on cir
culating no1 en be reduced from one per
cent per annum to one-half of one per
cent per annum. This is Secretary
Gaga's plan and a bill is now undergo
ing construction in line with these
specifications. If the recommendations
of the president and secretary of the
treasury are followed the bank3,speci
aliy, will have a bonanza. Under the
present law they are a privileged class
but they are still held in che ck by some
small restrictions. But under this pro
po3ed new law they are removed. They
will then issue circulating notes to the
full extent of the amount of bonds de
posited, when, as under the present law
they are allowed to issue only ninety
per cent. The minimum capital is re
duced; the tax, or interest, paid by the
banks on the money they issue,or,in oth
er words, which they borrow from the
government, is reduced from one per
cent to one-half of one per cent per an
num. Meanwhile interest rates to the
banks' customers are not lowered.
In speaking of Cuba he advises con
gress to keep hands off for the piesent.
The administration is not nearly so
sympathetic for the Cubans as the re
publican party professed to be during
the campaign.
There is nothing disappointing in the
president's message. lie is doing just
what the corporations and capitalists
hired him to do. It is a strong docu
ment for the fellow who holds the mon
ey but it is rather hard on the producer.
The president makes himself appear
in a ridiculous light when ho claims
great and good results for the Dingley
law and in almost the same breath cau
tions congress against bond issues, al
though he wants the secretary of the
treasury authorized to issue them iu
case of an emergency. 2so producer ot
laborer can appreciate the message, if
he understands it, and it is to b8 hoped
that congress will not follow the pres
ident's recommendations.
BAD F03 CHESTER.
It now looks like Chester ;s going to
have a hard row of ttumps to travel
through Aspirants are springing up ev
erywhere but the most formidbla can
didate yet mentioned lives in Wichita,
in the person of W.E Stanley than whom
there is no more popular a republican
in the Seventh district. The Topeka
Journal of Saturday evening "says:
"It is announced from olTioia' political
sources that W. E. Stanley of Wichita
nas aeciupa to enter tna race tor con
gress in the Seventh district, Mr. Stan
ley is a republican lawyer of considera
ble prominence. This means that the
republicans of Sedgwick county are not
for Chester I. Long."
very size proves they are not honest ac
cumulations. Was Christ the Son of
God? Ho said that .such itch men
could in no wise entsr Ine kingdom "f
God. If it was true when He said it.
it is true today. The so-called minis-
tars of God who pardon such offenses
bacause of the gift of a small part of
the sums stolen to colleges, to church
es and sometimes to the ministers
themselres, are no whit better than the
sellers of indulgences whom JLuther
scourged out of Germany.
Our people are being robbed by
wholesale. They do not receive the
ju3t rewards of their labors. They are
being pauperized and kept in want
while a few men by tries and combina
tions are gathering to themselves the
earnings of a continent. Yet how
many ministers, how many leading
church members, how many church pa
pers are denouncing the robbers and
the wrong as the Master did, and as it
is still written in His word? How
many Indeed are pursuing an opposite
course? I condemn no man. Let each
one's conscience answer him.
Search all history and you will find
no age when the robbery of the just
earnings of the masses was more .sys
tematic, more shameless and less re
sisted than today. There was never a
time wheu the worship of great riches,
however badly acquired, was more open
than now. While the pure in heart are
communing with the invisible God on
the summit, amid clouds and darkness
that are round about Him, vast num
bers, and among them, aa of old, many
Levites, are bowing down to the calf of
Gold, and they say to us, "These be thy
Gods, O Israel." When Moses and
Joshua reproached Aaron with his con
duct, he laid the fault on the people
and said that t pleise them lm Lad
thrown the gold ornaments iuto the Cie
and "there had come out this calf," im
plying that it was accidental (though
he did not dare to say so), and that he
was in no wise responsible. So in this
country, in which the public opinion cf
today can becoma the law torn morrow,
they w ho, like Aarou, dj nci enlighten
it, but on the contrary, without resist
ance to the robbery of tha pcsople, bow
d ownto those who have taken away their
earnlpgs.in effect say with the idolater c
of old, "Ve d;d nut do ;L; v.e, laen-U
ea3t the ga'd iato the tt?,"or permitted
it to be done, and -there cauia ct UiL
calf," tiency v are n ot tu biamo f.i
worshipping it. For iny part, I birlieyt
tnatsou.euiing more is required, anxi
that resistance to wrong is o'oe Ji na e
to God.
Tiieiik is nothing encouraging tj any
party m astay-at home vote, it s?ru
ply snow that tha people aredi3ro.-iunt-ecl
and don't know where to g for re
lief. Old party papers havT Pouantd
their minds against a third party a;d
when old party premises are is-)t ful
filled they give up hops. If onra U.t y
could be induced to read reform iitcra
ture they would be in a position to put
the real remedy into effect.

All the republican papers
and some Populist papers
have done a good deal of
barking at Hon. Y. F. Brown;
for informing the public how
and by whom the maximum

will defend each other. We
admire Mr. Brown's pluck

it will be owned and control

Morgan at the head. Every
public improvement these
clays is used asan instru
ment with which to rob the
people.
The Standard OilCompany,
the Sugar Trust, the railroad
companies, and nearly every
combine known to the people
of the country are making
more money than ever before
in their history. To this fact
is laid the claim of prosperi
ty and to this alone. The day
laborer gets no more for what
he has to sell but pays more
for what he has to buy. The
man with money is prosper
ous but the man without
money sees no more hope now
than lie did a year ago. The
masses are gradually sinking
and they will continue to sink
as long as the government is
playing in with the money
power.
In Cleveland, Ohio, seventeen shop
girls worki ig in a knit giola nrinufae

because they were driven to stealing
small articles occasionally on account
of starvation wages. It is -ar burning
shame that young girls must stay away
from school in order to earn a little
morey to perpetuate thsir existence,
hut when tht?y are not even paid decent
wages, the English language does not
afford words to appropriately express
the outrage. It is such instances as
these that put tumking men it.to deep
study. What will tittjorao of the rising
generation if wh do not have a speedy
and radical change for th? better? .

CUE HlrilS ALMANAC AND PAPER.
We are ir. formed that the 1898 Al
manac of Prof. Irl R. Hicks is now
ready, and judging from it3 past his
tory, it will not be many weeks in find
ing it3 way into homes and offices all
over America. It is much larger and
finer than any previous Issue. It con
tains 11G pages, is splendidly printed
aud illustrated on fine book paper, bav-
i mg the finest portrait ever given of
Prof. Hicks: P can no longer be de
nied that the publications of Prof.
Hicks have become a necessity to the
family and commercial iifeof t!ii3 coun
try. His journal, ' Word and Works,"
aside from its storm, weather aud as
tronomical features, ha3 taken rank
with thy best liu-raty, scientific aud
faintly magazines of the age. Do not
believe hearsay and reports. See the
Ilicks Almanac and paper for yourself.
You will thsa know why they are so
popular. They are educators of the
millions, and unrivaled safeguards to
property and human life. It is a mat
ter of simple record that Prof . . Ilicks
has foretold for many years all great
storms. Goods, 3rou;h3 and tornadoes,
and even the recent terrible drouth all
over the country. The Almanac alone
is 25 cents a copy. '.The paper is SI. CO

POPULIST SAXI05AL PLATF0S2T.
The Peoples party, assembled in national
convention, reaffirms its allegiance to the
principles declared by the founders or the re
public, and also to the fundamental rnucipe
of just Koverntnent. ns enunciated in the plat
form ot the party la I83i. We recoirnteo that
tbroufrhthe connivance of the present and
preceoinff aomiuistrationa tho country nas
reached a crisisin its national life as predicted
In our declaration four years aj?o, and that
prompt and patriotic action is the supreme
duty of the hour. We reulize that while wc
iiave political indept udeticee. our financial
and industrial independence is yet to be at
tained by restoring to our -ouutry the consti
tutional control and exercise or tbe I unit ion
necessary to a peoole's povernmeut. which
functions have lieen bisly surreudered by
our put-lie servants to corporate monopo
lies. The intiueuce of European money
changers lias been more potent in khapliur
leirislation than the voice of tho American
people. Executive power and pe.tronuce
have been used to corrupt our legislatures
and defeat the will of the p-oule. aud plutoc
racy has thereby been enthroned upon the
ruins of democracy. To restore ttie a-overn-ment
intended by tho fathers, and for tbe wel
fare of this and future jjenenitiois,we demand
the establishment of an economic and finan
cial system, which shall make us masters of -our
own affairs and independent of Kuropean
oontrol. by the adoption of the following dec
laration of principles:
USANCE.
First We demand a national money, safe
and sound, issued by the general government
only, without the intervention of bants of is
sue to be a full legal tender for all debts pub
lic and private a just, equitable sad efficient
means of distribution direct to the people and
through the lawful disbursements of the gov
erumeut. Second We demand the free and unre
stricted coinage of silver and gold ai the pres
ent legal ratio of sixtet-n to one. without wait
ing for tbo consent of foreign nations.
Third Wo demand that the volume ot cir
culating medium be tpccdily increased to an
amount EuUk ient to meet : be demands or the
business and population of this country and
to restore the just b.-vol of prices of labor and
production.
Fourth s"c denounce the sale of bonds and
the increase of the public interest bearing
debt made by the prereiit administration a
unnecessary and without authority or law.and
that no more bonds bo issued except by spe
cific act of conirress.
Firth We demand etieh legislation as will
prevent the demonetization of the lawful
money of tho United States by private con
tract. Sixth We demand that tho government, in
payment of its obligations, shall use it option
as to the kind of lawful money In which they
are to be paid, and we deuounce the present
and preceding administrations for surrender
ing this option to the holders of government
obiigatious.
SeveDth Wo demand a graduated income
tax to the end that aggregated wealth shall
bear its just proportion of taxation, and we
regard the recent decision of the supreme
court relative to the income tax law ns a mis
interpretation of the constitution and an in
vasion of the rightful potters of congress over
the subject or taxation.
Eighth We demand that postal savings
banks be established by the government for
the safe deposit of the saviugs of the poopl
and to facilitate exchange.
TKANSPOHTATION.
First Transportation being a m'ans of ex
change aud a necessity.the government should
own and cperato the railroads in the interest
of the people and on a non-partisan basis: to
the end that all may be accorded the same
treatment ia transportation and that tho
tyranny ami political power now exercised by
the great railroad corporations, which result
in theiinpnini.i-.it, if not the uestructiou. of
the political ru-'tis and personal iliit-rties of
the citizen, n.ty be destroyed. Fueh owner
ship is to lie accomplished gradually in a man
ner consistent with sound public po.'lev.
Second The interest o! the United States in
tho public highways hilit with public money!
and the prooi-ods of vxtenslve grants of land
to the l a -ilic railroad', should never tie alien
ated, mortgaged or w.Id. but guarjed and pro
tected lor the general welfare, a pmvl.ied by
the laws 'irv:iu:inir soeli rai!ruls. The firo
closurc ot exist inv Wi-uh ol 'the United flKtea
on thce r:i: sho-ii i nt ftnee follow .lcfaultln
payment thereof by the debt. ircoinpanl-;an4
at the lueelostire sales of said m:iJs the gov
ernment should purchase the same lfjl be
comes ueeessury to protect its interests there
in, or if they can be purchased at a reasonable
price, and the government shall operate said
railroads as public highways tor the benefit of
the whole people and not in the interest of the-- '
few. under suitable previsions for protection
or life and property, giving to all transporta
tion interests equal prtrilcgi-s and equal rates
for fares and freights.
Third We denounce the present infamous
schemes for refunding these debts, and de
mand tuat the laws now applicable) thereto bo
executed and administered according to tbelr
true inieut and spirit.
Fotirth-Tho telegraph, like tho post oflice
system, beiuir a necessity tor the transmission
of news, should be owned and operated by !
the government in the interests ot the people.
" LAND.
First the true policy demands that the na
tional and state legislation thali bo jucn as
will ultimately enable every prudent and in
dustrious citizen to secure a homo, and there
fore the land should not be moMopiilizod for
speculative purposes. Alllnudi now held by
railroads and other corporations in excess of
their actual needs should by lawful means bo
reclaimed b the government ind held for ac
tual settler only, and priaio land mononlv.
as well as alien ownership, should bo prohib
ited. Second We con temn the frauds by wS.Iett
the land grants to Paciiic railroad companies
nave, through the connivance of the interior
department, robbed multitudes of actual U.n
fide settlea or their homes and mlnersof tttetr
claims. a-d we demand h-glsjntioii bv eongrcs
which will enforce the exemption oT mineral
Jod from such grants, after as well as before
Third Wo detnand that ell liona fide settlers
on all ptii I c lands be granted tree hoi:ies, as
provided ia the national homestead law and
that no exception le made In the esse o' In
dian reservations when opened tor settlement,
and that all lands now patented come under
this demand.
Fourth Direct Legislation: We favor ti
system of direct legislation through the initia
tive ar.d referendum under proper cocstitu- "
tlonal safeguards.
