A Christmas Story by Frank R. Stockton
Special arrangements have teen made for the
-publication. In next Sunday's Journal, of a
novelette by Frank E. Stockton. It la a Christ
man love story entitled "Major rendallas," and
Is Invested with the unique charm so character
istic of thl3 writer's work. Stockton has a pe
culiar twist in bis mental make-up that leads
him to place his characters In the most remarka
ble situations, aDd at the eame time give such
happenings an air of the greatest naturalness,
lie Invariably succeeds in gaining the reader's
attention, and holding It to the end. These char
' actertstlca are well shown In "Major rendallas,
which is a highly entertaining and attractive
etory. As befits a Christmas love story, or, In
deed, a love story of any kind, the outcome Is
happy, and the Journal congratulates Its readers
on the treat In store for them.
It is not of the slightest consequence
whether Speaker Crisp shall announce
his committees before the first of next
year or not not the slightest.
In spite of the fact that the reports of
iho value of merchandise imported show
that nearly half is admitted free of
duty, tho free-trade organ continues to
speak of the present tariff law as one
which increased duties all along tho line.
The latest news from Brazil affords
ground to believe that tho present gov
ernment will be permanently estab
lished without being forced to resort to
bloodshed. This belief is based on tho
fact that the insurgents in Rio Grande
tlo Sul havo laid down their arms.
It seems that tho newspapers which
devoted themselves so largely to ridi
culing Postmaster-general Wanamaker
the first two years of his terra havo re
linquished that diversion. The "Wana
maker bargain counter" has now no
mention that the houso does not pay for.
That irredeemable currency which
Senator PeiTcr would have issued in or
der to establish a system of service pen
sions without cost to the government
would be mo3t likely to sutler deprecia
tion and would certainly bo discrimi
nated against. It is too latoa day to
issue paper money without a specie ba
sis. Those who think that the name of
our fellow-citizen, Isaac Pusey Gray, is
pot bciDg written on possible presi
dential tickets because the Indianapolis
democratic organs never mention him
in that connection, are mistaken, lie is
most named as a Vice-presidential pos
sibility in connection with both Hill and
Gorman.
Between the Illinois Democrats who
are angry with Colonel Morrison and
Editor Jones for breaking into tho Dem
ocratic delegation and running off men
to Mills, and theso who aro provoked
that Springer was a candidate when he
bad no possible chance andthusbrought
about tho defeat of Mills, thero is yet a
bitter feeling.
IxASMUcn as Mr. Cleveland is not very
likely to receive tho Democratic nomi
nation the New York Press suggests
that ho become the candidate of tho
mugwumps and thejibooses those once
Republicans and now Democrats who
r.ro 6ololy devoted to Mr. Cleveland. A
jiboose, it should bo remarked, is a
Democrat who feels himself too good
for association with his party should it
not nominate Mr. Cleveland.
Testimony in a damage suit in Chi
cago goes to show that the various mid
dlemen and promoters of the syndicato
rale of the breweries in that city and
Milwaukeo within the past two years
received $3,250,000 of the $11,000,000
paid by tho subscribers to tho stock and
bonds known as tho English syndicate,
and for which the property was' capi
talized, tho owners receiving but $5,
700,000. This looks as if the British
capitalists had been victimized and
would find their dividends rather small.
The few Republicans of South Da
kota who had a hand in making Row
Mr. Kyle United States Senator now
know that they have helped into that
position a very persistent and very
small-sired trickster. The man who
goes to both parties begging for places
on committees is not a man for a State
; to be proud of. Mr. Kylo was sent to
South Dakota by tho assistance of an
. Eastern home missionary organization.
' It is not to their credit that such men
aro sent to the wild and woolly country
to teach the people any sort of creeds
that should be enforced by manly and
straight-forward conduct.
AnouT a year ago tho Indianapolis
News was having a great deal to say
about the making of contracts to light
tho city. The Council made no con
tracts with the electric light companies,
and now tho matter devolves upon tho
Board of Public Works, which has had
no time as yet to devote to this matter.
Doubtless when their capacity and en
ergy shall be onco focused upon this
matter, something remarkable will be
done, but at present and during; all tho
months that tho board has been in ex
istence the city has been paying 70 per
cent, moro for each electric light than
was paid under tho contract which tho
Denny regime made. Tho News never
ceased to abuse Mayor Denny and his
associates, but it has no criticism for
the Board of Public Works which per
mits the electric light companies to de
mand and collect their own price for
lights. ' Cannot tho News stir up tho B.
of P. W.T
"GIVE US FACTE."
To the Editor of the Indiana polls Journals
Under the bead of "Give Us Facta." I
would like to ask a few questions and have
bottom facts for answers.
1. l'revions to tno duties being raised on
plate-glass, is it not a fact that the free
trade press and orators declared tba't plate
glass could never be mado in this country,
just as they do to-day about tin-plate!
2. Since tbo tariff was raised and it be
gan to be made here, what is the diilerenco
in the prices between the present and be
fore that time?
3. It free trade is all that any nation
needs to enable them to reach ont and grasp
the entire markets of the world, why are so
many manufacturing plants in.frce-trado
Kngland running on half time, o ntircly
idle,, and the wages of the men eiugre
cucedf 1. If wage9 in this country ai being
constantly reduced, as the Aiuerican-Lu-glish
are constantly deolaring, why is it
that workingnien of all classes aro so eager
to get here!
5. Before wire nails were protected to a
point that made their production in this
country possible they sold here in this city
at$Gper keg. Since that time, to the
writer's certain knowledge, a single keg
has sold hero at 82.K). Now, if the tariff is
a tax. where does it como in on the nails,
and does it not come in about the same
way on every article that wo are protected
in tho manufacture off
Ovkr the River.
1. The Journal cannot state definitely
whether the free-trado prophet declared
that plate-glass could not bo made in
this country or not, but tho probability
is that ho did. Ho made such predic
tions regarding tho production of steel
rails, plates for armored ships and war
ships, and modern guns. Tho only goods
which the British-taught free-trader be
lieves the people1 of this country can
produce are tho raw materials and food
essential to British success. Ho prac
tically denies to the American the ca
pacity to be more than Ma hewer of wood
and a drawer of water" for British capi
talists. 2. Before 18Q0 no plate-glass of any
account was made in this country, and
the price of English, French and Ger
man plato was $2.50 a square foot. It
has fallen to less than 75 cents a equnro
foot since the industry has been estab
lished under the protective duty. About
a year ago' a superintendent of a plate
glass plant in this State gave tho aver
age price at tho works as 59 cents a
equare foot.
Tho other questions propounded aro
based on facts with which thoso who
deny the advantages of protection should
wrestle. To the protectionist they aro
arguments to sustain that policy.
AN ABUBE IN OITICIAL BEP0KTS.
The American custom of printing the
reports of heads of departments and
bureaus has sonio good features and
some bad ones. It is a good thing to
give publicity to all the operations of
the government, to keep the light turned
on, and to let the peoplo know what is
being done. This sort of publicity is
an encouragement to well-doing and a
check to abuses. But. on tho other
hand, the publication of annual reports
is apt to beget a rivalry as to length and
bulkiness, to encourage "padding," and
to foster a kind of egotism which leads
some persons, when they have an oppor
tunity to appear in print official', to
attempt to exploit their ideas out of all
reason. A good deal of money is thus
thrown away in printing reports which
are of very little value.
The Journal has heretofore called at
tention to the need of reform in this
matter, and a case of recent occurrence
emphasizes tho necessity. Tho Com
missioner of Navigation is a subordinate
officer oftho Treasury Department, tho
present Commissioner being Mr. William
Bates. Like other heads of bureaus, he
issues an annual report of tho operations
of his office. Last year Commissioner
Bates issued a "report which irritated
Secretary Windom because it attempted
to cover so much ground, and actually
made recommendations at variance
with those of tho Secretary. The
bumptious official was given to
understand that it mu6t notoccuragain,
but it has. A week or so ago tho acting
Secretary of tho Treasury was surprised
to seo in tho newspapers a summary of
tho annual report of tho Commissioner
of Navigation. As tho report had not
yet been submitted to the Secretary ho
sent for it. His surprise was increased
to find that tho able Commissioner had
formulated a report embracing a history
of commerce from tho war of 1S12 to tho
present time, with a great number of
excursive and episodical features, in
cluding his own theories, viowe and
opinions on many questions of commer
cial and administrative policy. Eng
land came in for a largo sharo of atten
tion, being referred to as "our inveter
ate foe." One of tho sensational sub
headings of the report was "War with
England," and another "Tho Small End
of tho Horn." There was no end of
suggestions, recommendations and fore
casting of policy. Tho report was full
of irrelevant and impertinent matter,
and was unfit to go before tho public as
an official document. Tho matter was
brought to tho attention of Secretary
Foster, who directed that a letter bo
written to the Commissioner reprimand
ing him for giving tho substance of his
report to the press without first having
submitted It to the Secretary, and fur
thermore, directing him to rewrite it,
leaving out all extraneous matter, per
sonal opinions, discussions of policy, etc.
The incident is important only as il
lustrating tho tendency to abuse the cus
tom of printing annual reports. As
these reports are now published there is
a great deal of useless repetition, and
money is wasted in printing matter of
little or no value to the public. Heads
of departments should seo to it that
their subordinates do not take advant
age of their annual reports to exploit
themselves and their ideas after tho
manner of Commissioner Bates. There
is not nn official report issued by any de
partment of tho government that might
not be greatly condensed and improved
by tho process. In all these reports
there is a tendency to diffascness and
sloppiness. and it aeeni9 to grow from
year to year. If it continues it may be
come necessary to create a now office,
the incumbent of which shall be known
as tho Government Censor and Boiler
down of Official Reports.
The Due Do Litta.who represents ono
of the oldest titles and wealthiest fami
lies in Italy, is now visiting this coun
try. In a published interview he says:
The sentiment aroused in Italy by tho
killing of tho members of the Matia in New
Orleans was of a mixed character. The
lower classes, of course, became excitfcd by
tho exaggerated reports which reached us
at first, and they never read the later ac
counts, 1 suppose When the minds of the
lower classes m tho romance countries are
set atire they work ranidlv. The nobility
and aristocracy thought that the United
States might havo acted more politely in
answering King Humbert, but tbeir sym
pathies wero aronstd only for the city of
New Orleans. We know what these people
are, and we could have only congratulated
America if it had succeeded in ridding it
eelf of the entire band. It Is a great pity
that Americans, when they visit Italy,
cannot bee moro of tho backbone of the
country.
It is a pity also that Americans judge
of the national characteristics of foreign
peoples by what they seo of thoso who
como to this country. Emigrants do
not, as a general rule, represent the
best type of national character. The
Italians are not all organ-grinders and
members of tho Mafia, nor are all
Chinese laundrymcn and high-binders.
Thero is a type of character and civ
ilization in those countries very differ
ent from that represented by those who
como to our shores. It is sometimes
well to remember this in dealing with
international questions.
The stockholders of tho lato Metro
politan National Bank, ot Cincinnati,
have brought suit in tho United States
Court to recover $4o0,000 from tho direc
tors of tho bank at tiio time of its sus
pension and certain ex-directors whoso
terms of office covered more or less of
tho period of losses which wrecked the
bank. The stockholders havo received
55 per cent, of the value of their stock
from the assets of tho bank, and this
suit is to recover the remaining 45 per
cent. Tho directors are charged with
malfeasance in office in that they utterly
and willfully failed and neglected to
perform their official duties and paid no
attention to the affairs of the bank,
whereby it became subject to misman
agement and was finally wrecked. The
interesting point in tho suit is that it
aims at holding bank directors person
ally and pecuniarily responsible for the
performance of their duties as such.
The establishment and enforcement of
this prlnciplo would havo a beneficial
effect in business circles. Under the
present system there are comparatively
few bank directors who really direct the
affairs of the bank, while in some in
stances tho names of well-known capi
talists are used to bolster up shaky con
cerns and create false confidence.
Texas is having a new experience of
the folly o legislating against foreign
capital. Last winter, in obedience to
tho demands of tho farmer element, a
law was passed abolishing tho alien
ownership of land, nn alien mortgagee
being denied tho right to take and hold
real estate by foreclosure. Tho law ap
plied not only to foreigners, hut to
American firms or syndicates in which
foreigners were interested. Its eftcct
was to prevent such persons who had
loaned money in Texas on real-estate
security from collecting their debts.
Tho law has been in force only a few
months, but it has already put a stop to
the loaning of foreign capital in the
State, to tho great injury of business
and the embarrassment of those who
wish to borrow money. Texas is a new
State and needs money to develop her
resources. What ciiflerenco does it make
to her people whether they borrow of
foreign or American capitalists? By
driving out foreign capital they havo
lessened competition in the loan busi
ness, and will probably havo to pay a
higher rate of interest.
The New York Tribune, in a review
of the business situation, says: "Money
is plenty and growing moro plenty and
cheaper in ppite of tho activity of trade,
for tho volume of circulation was never
surpassed, and another million in gold
como from Europe last week, further
shipments thence wero announced, and
tho Treasury paid out $800,000 more new
notes for silver." All tho information
from those who are well informed as to
tho financial situation is to the same
effect. The recent report of tho Secre
tary of tho Treasury showed by statis
tics that our total circulating medium,
which, on July 1, 1SC1, was $1,407,440,707.
or $23.41 for each individual of our pop
ulation, had risen, on Dec. 1, to $1,577,
202,070, or $24.08 per head. The method
of estimating the money circulation of a
country by tho rate per head is mislead
ing, but theso figures show that our cir
culation is steadily increasing.'nnd that
is a sufficient answer to those who de
mand its increaso by extraordinary
measures.
The appointment of Judgo W. A.
Woods to be United States circuit judge
under tho new law will be warmly ap
proved by thoso who know his ability
and fitness for tho position, and strongly
condemned by those who are already
committed to tho senseless and unjust
clamor that has been raised again3t him
by political opponents for political pur
poses. Ho is a lino lawyer, a Christian
gentleman, a man of incorruptible in
tegrity, and a just judge.
For: tho first time in many years thero
i9 a Democratic United States Senator
who was a Union soldier. This is
Palmer, of Illinois, and the Democrats
propose to make the most of him. He
has been placed on the pensions commit
tee, with the understanding that he is to
oppose any new departures or increased
liberality in tho pension laws. They
say he can do it because he was a Union
soldier and they will back him up with
their votes.
The remarks which Chairman Gowdy,
of tho Republican State central commit
tee, made to tho Marion Club, Tuesday
night, contained n volume of practical
wisdom in regard to what should be
done by Republicans in order to achieve
success. Organization is tho first thing.
and then the nomination of county tick
ets which will give general satisfaction
is the next matter of importance. Not
only must tho candidates bo good men,
but they must bo so distributed that no
section can feel that it is neglected.
The short crops, tho prevailing low
prices and tho genoral dissatisfaction
which the Democratic calamity press had
been working up for two years counted
against the Republicans in 1600 among
the farmers. Theso influences have
passed away, and Republicans who did
not vote in 1890 because they were in
doubt about the Republican policy of
Congress will be found on hand next
year.
Dr. Otto Seifert, of tho University
of Wurzburg, announces that tho grip is
caused by a microbo which has been
named microbus seifertius, and which
can only bo extirpated successfully by
gin mixed with benzoid of soda. If tho
microbes could be caught on the fly, so
to speak, and the mixture poured down
their throats, all would be well, but if
tho meeting of tho bacilli with tho
medicine has to tako placo in the in
terior of tho individual who has tho
grip, what shall such a proscription
profit tho man of prohibition principles?
The criminal proceeding against E. M.
Field, the bankrupt Now York broker,
seems to be justified, notwithstanding the
fact that some of the circumstances are
such as to excite sympathy for the Field
family. The point was made by Field's
counsel that it was barbarous to take a man
out of an Insano hospital into h criminal
court room. Under some circumstances it
would be, but this case is peculiar. As
soon as the failure and defalcation becarao
known Field was taken in band by his
friends, and, with the aid of one or two
physicians, was committed to a private
insano asylum. There is no conclusive'
proof that he was insane. Experience has
proved that money and social inlluence can
get a certificate of insanity in New York
where no insanity exists. It would be a
uronstrons outrage if a defaulter and swin
dler should bo permitted to escape justice
under the plea of insanity simply because
he was a member of the Field family. Tho
district attorney put the case rightly when
he said: "Mr. Field may be insane; if he is,
it must be proved as a defense to the in
dictment in the usual way. No man ever
charged with a crime can avoid prosecu
tion by being committed to a private in
sane asylum."
"Counting out" is a terra familiar not
only to Democratic politicians but to all
children who play games. Tho Democratic
transaction is performed behind closed
doors, and, according to information
that leaks out from timo to time, no fixed
method is lollowed. When chilarcn count
out, however, a formula is essential. Every
person, not too old to remember youthful
plays will recall his especial lingo used
for such occasions. With some it began:
"Ery, iry, ichery-Ann;" with others, "Eny,
nieeny, mony my." There is a variety of
jingles, but here is ono used, says nn En
glish writer, by Cornish children, which is
probably unfamiliar to most readers of the
Journal:
I-re, o re, igery, eben,
Uat a bone, crack a lone, ten or eleven;

Three times seven are twenty-one o-u-t out!
There is a sound aboutltthalsupportstbo
theory of linguists that these rhymes all
have a common origin; but, at all events, it
answers the purpose as well as any other.
The American Tribune, the soldiers'
paper, published iu Indianapolis, comes
out with a now and attractive head
and various other typographical changes
that add much to its appearance. Col. W.
R. Ilolloway, who took charge of the paper
some weeks ago, has added many editorial
features of interest, end contemplates
further improvements, both of a literary
and mechanical sort, that will make it of
still greater value to veterans.
To the Ertltor of the Inrtianapo'.U Journal:
In your editorial on "Practical Reciprocity
you say this administration la the rlrst to carry
the theory Into practice. Is it not a fact that wo
havo tried a reciprocity treaty with Canada!
And havo thero not been some other treaties
with such provisions! n. a. w.
Yes; there was an alleged treaty of reci
procity with Canada, hut it was only such
in name, because there was no reciprocity
about it. Free trado was declared in the
natural products of both countries, lum
ber, agricultural products, fish, etc. Can
ada had no markot for our products, and
we made one for theirs, consequently it was
ended by tho action of our government.
Real reciprocity Is where one country opera
its markets to tho products of another,
which it does not or cannot produce in suf
ficient quantities, in exchange for the ad
vantage of the markets of the other coun
try for its products which that country
does not produce. There wero no treaties
of that character nntil those now effective
were negotiated by tho present adminis
tration. ABOUT PtOPLK AND THINGS.

An Able and Successful Executive Why
Should There lie a Change?
Minneapolis Tr.bune.
Even his enemies admit that Mr. Harri
son's administration is one of the best in
the history of the nation. It would be a
queer incident if a thousand representative
Republicans, each one testifying to tho
ability, the purity and tbo unqualified suc
cess of a President ot their own choosing,
should turn about next June and select
some ono else for a standard bearer.
"But," siys one. "he is too cold and tin
demonstrative! He isn't effusive! He does
not grasp one's hand and smile, and joke,
and punch a fellow m the ribs when you go
to se him."
No! The Tribuno confesses to these
shortcomings. If we want a man for that
business thero are a hundred here in our
own State who aro his superiors. But few
of our C4.C0J.0J0 of people have occasion to
look for these demonstrations on the part
of the President. All but a select nnniber
tie concerned in having an executive who
will attend to the business of the na
tion, who will occupy the office with dig
nity, who will discbarge its high duties
ably, who will conduct its affairs houestly,
who will leave no room for complaint not
that Tom, Dick or Harry has been nnablo
to drink, or joke or swap stories with him
but that he has failed in discharging with
scrupulous fidelity the mighty trust which
a great nation bna bestowed npon him.
That's what the people want, and if theso
great duties are fuitnfnlly performed they
can well afford to sacrifice tbo froth and
foam of good fellowship for these better
and nobler qualifications.
Mr. Harrison is a bigger man than he was
in 188. Bigger, we mean, in the estima
tion of the country. He has been a revela
tion to those even who knew him best. His
mistakes have been so few as to make the
oldest statesmen marvel at his capacity.
No ono would have spoken of him as an
orator four years neo! To-day, he is
admittedly the ablest speaker on tho
continent. t His state papers are
models, his messages almost beyond
criticism. What his work has been in
that vast service which is of necessity
veiled from the publio eye for the time
being, only history, which will penetrate
these recesses when the necessity for
secrecy is past, can tell. But if his genius
is not found stamped uion all the im
portant measures of this administration so
clearly as to be unmistakable, then those
who know him best will bo surprised.
He has grown in publio estimation day by
day, as we havo said, but success has not
spoiled him. He is the same unassuming
man as when he toiled in the courts of In
diana or fought for the rights of tho North
west in tho Senato of the United States.
Patient amid all the varied annoyances,
perplexities and unjust, not t say crnel,
misconceptions of his character, which
have found voice in press and gossip, he
has gone on, commending himself to the
country more and more, nntil with general
acclaim ho is awarded a foremost place
among those whose fume has become a rich
heritago to tho American people.
Is there a word of the above which is not
true? Is it not atfirmed daily even by thoso
who do not admire it!
Standing higher than four years ago
having vindicated tho party that selected
him for its standard-bearer, why should he
not be stronger as a candidate now than be
fore he was tried in that crnciblo from
which he has emerged without flaw or
drossf
Tho Tribune is not going to have a pet
candidate. It will be content to accept the
man who shall be chosen by tbo party's
representatives next June. That party is
bigger than any man, bigger than any
newspaper; bnt as a representative Repub
lican journal it would fail in its dnty did it
not remind the country that it is usually
safe to let well enough alone. No charges
of dishonesty, no allegations of inca
paoitv, no breath of scandal have
greeted this administration. Its high
character has silenced slander and
compelled the respect of even its partisan
opponents. In this rozard the administra
tion of Benjamin Harrison is almost unique.
The jobs and corruption about which the
country usually hears so much seem to be a
lost art under tho rule of tins plain man
from Indiana. Deficient in no necessary
attributo for a successful executive, what
cause, what circumstance, what emer
gency, what reason demands a change? Let
the American peoplo rcllcct and find one if
they can.
A Democratic Scheme.
Boston Journal.
Cotton ties are one of the articles which
tho Democratic leaders propose to try to
pntonthe free lint. The manufacture of
cotton ties is a Northern industry, and
need, of course, expect no mercy from the
chivalry. But p-opio familiar with tbo
trade say thatsince tbeduty whs increased,
while next to no cotton tie have been im
ported, prices have ruled lower than when
the cotton-growers of the Eolith were de
pendent on a foreign monopoly.
When Arbitration Would lie Beneficial.

The coal miners in tho Brazil district are
having a hard struggle against starvation;
many families now find difficulty ingot

UP TO, TIIE CIRCUIT BENCH
Judge William A. Wood?, of the Federal
District Court, promoted.
Appointed Under tbe New Law. and a Mem
ter cf the 'ew Appellate Court
fcketch cf llis Career.
Yesterday afternoon an Associated Press
dispatch announced the appointment of
W'.lliain A. Woods to be a United States
circuit judge. The news was received with
favor amounting to enthusiasm among the
great majority of those who read it. every
one acknowledging that of all men in Indi
ana Judge Woods was best equipped to till
this place in the newiy-croated court. Tho
news was by no means a surprise, as it has
been expected ever since tho passage of the
law by the last Congress creating the court
that ho would be chosen, though neither
the Judge nor his friends had received any
assurance from the President directly or
indirectly that such would be the case.
Under tho now law this circuit, consist
ing of Indiana. Illinois and Wisconsin,
will have two judges instead of one, and
these two. with tboSupnnn Court mem
ber accredited to the circmt (that member
at present beiug Justice Harlan) will con
stitute tbo Appellate Court. The other
circuit iudg is Judge Gresham r-nd he and
Judge Woods will be of equal power.
The Appellate Court will bo located at
Chicago, but tho law permits the judges to
reside wherever they may choose and al
lows mileage and per diem while they are
away attending the court. Each will, as
heretofore, be competent to sit in nisi prins
canses but not to sit in the upper court in
cases they have previously heard. Judgo
Woods will continue to be a resident of In
dianapolis. The appointment of the new judge may be
confirmed by the Senate before the holiday
vacation; if not it will be suspended until
the reassembling of that body on J au. 4. The
appointee has bad a long judicial career
considering his age. for he is yet compar
atively a young man, about fifty-seven
years old. He obtained his education in
Wabash College, and was also a tutor there
for one year, teaching Latiu, mathematics,
history, book-keeping and other branches.
(Jen. J. IL Carnahan and John A. Finch, of
this city, were among his pupils. Follow
ing this he went to Marion, this btato,
where an attempt was made to start a col
lege, and taught there lor a year. It was
at Marion, in lbOl, that he was admitted to
the bar by Judge Biddle.
March 17, lNJ-j, be removed to Goshen and
entered upon the practice of law. For
some time his occupation was a barren
ideality, but he put in hia leisure time at
study while the wolf bowled about the
door of hia dismal little law oltice, the
entire furnishing of which would not have
been assessed at $2.53 even nnder the pres
ent high appraisement. His one room
6erved all purposes of eating, sleeping and
consulting with clients whose appearances
were nearly as rare as Douati's comet.
After a time the pluck and perseverance
of the struggling young lawyer began to
meet recognition. His cases in court in
creased and in time he began to enjoy a
lucrative practice. In 1ST0 he married Miss
Mattie Newton, of Des Moines, la., and
settling down as a permanent resident of
Goshen began to be recognized as a leader
in the Republican ranks and an authority
in county and Statu politics.
In 1873 he was elected circuit judge for
the Elkhart district. At the end of that
term, a period of six y ears, h? was re-elected
without opposition. He had entered npon
his second term, and served until January,
rj81, when he was called to a seat upon the
.Supreme Bench of the State, to which be
had been elected in the previous October
election, he and Judge Elliott taking their
places in that court at the same time. He
remained on the Supremo Bench until May,
1583, when he was appointed by President
Arthur to his present position as judge of
the United States District Court of In
diana. He purchased the residence at No.
GUI North Alabama street, and bus been a
citizen of Indianapolis since the 21st day of
August. 1S3J.
J udgo Woods is a man of striking person
ality, being six feet in height and weighing
about 229 pounds. He is of llorid complex
ion, and wears a full beard. His head is
massive, and ho would attract attention in
any gathering. As a ready and concise
talker he perhaps has no superior in Indi
ana. On a number of occasions, especially
at bar meetings where speeches have been
made concerning those taken away by
death, it has been observed that the re
marks of Judge Woods, plain and vigorous,
delivered without oratorical effort, were
tho best worded and roost worthy efiorts.
lie has a quiet dignity of manner and a
judicial pose that seem to be an endowment
rather than au acquirement. His tempera
ment is eminently of the judicial cast, and
he is indeed a typical judge.
Mentioned for the Succession.
The elevation of Judge Woods to the cir
cuit court will, leave tho judgeship of the
United States District Court of Indiana
vacant. A number of lawyers well
equipped for this position have been men
tioned, among the most prominent of
whom aro Judges Lewis C. Walker and
Byron K. Elliott, of this city, Judgo Walter
Olds, of Columbia City, and Judgo Monks,
of Winchester.
LIFE IS THE NORTHLAND.
Interesting Talk on Swedish Customs
Cecile Gohl, at Plymouth Church.
by
"Homo Life in Sweden" was the subject
of tho lectnre delivered last evening at
Plymouth Church by Miss Cecile Gohl. The
lady was dressed in the bright and pictur
esque garb of the Swedish middle class, and
not the least interesting features were her
piquant humor and an accent which gave
an additional charm to a highly entertain
ing and instructive lecture. Miss Gobi is a
native of Switzerland, who for several
years was a teacher in Sweden, where she
was in close contact with the people and
came to know and love them in their homo
life. She spoke of the Scandinavians in
this country who, with their children,
number two millions law-abiding citizens,
not au Anarchist among them. These work
hard and live simply; tbey come here to
stay, cultivating the prairie, working iu the
lumber regions and in the mines of Lake
Superior. They have an inherited love of
obedience to law. She then spoke of the
life of the middle claso in Sweden, their
extremo politeness in the family and of
their customs. She spoke at length of tho
admirable qualities of the Swedish domes
tic, and the heart of every house
keeper in tho audience yearned for
one of these jewels. Miss .Gobi in
formed her bearers that in Sweden
children aro not allowed to become the
tyrants of the household. They are ad
mirably trained to keep out of the way
when not wanted. A Swedish child only
speaks when spoken to. "And yet," said
the lecturer, "young Sweden is not crushed
and miserable, but is lighthearted, foud of
athletic snorts and all sorts of games;
swims like a duck and skates to perfection.
In Sweden the celebration of Christmas
dates tar back into tho heathen ages, when
tho. Vikiiitfs drank their mead out of an ox
horn. Nearly every child gots a pig of
almond paste as a Christmas present,
typical of the ancient feasts. At this sea
son mead is still made and drank. Yule
tide lasts about two months. Thero are
four weeks of preparation, two or three
weeks of celebration and the remainder of
the time is taken no in recuperation. A
cow or pig is killed and made into sausage.
Baking is done at night and the thin, hard
pieces made of a mixture of rye and oats
with a hole in the center to string it on
Folea and hang it up for future reference,
t will keep for six months aud be as fresh
as on the first day. Theu a fun ginger
bread army of men and women is made.
When you see the pantry shelves full of
meat, fish and cakes you think they are
Setting ready for a famine, a siege or a
lizzard, but when tho boya go back to

the pantry shelves are empty."

CLOSING CP THE YEAR'S WORK.
Indianapolis Wholesale Merchants and ilan
ufactnrers Are Spreading Out. - '
With this week a majority of the travel
ing salesmen close up their year's' work,
and will remain with their families or
friends until anotber year cornea in, this
being their vacation season. In the year
now closing, as a rule, they have been very
successful
With every year the wholesale merchants
and tho manufacturers of Indianapolis are
reaching into new territory. But a few
years ago Indiana and part of Illinois was
the field that the wholesale men of Indian
apolis sent traveling salesmen into. Now
the travelers for Indianapolis dry-gocds
houses, groceries, etc., can be found selling
goods in Indiana, Illinois, Missouri. Kan
sas. Ohio, Michigan and half a dozen other
States. Indianapolis wholesale confection
ers, baking-powder manufacturers, and
houses in mauy other liuee are sending
their goods into every State aud Territory
ot the Union, not in small consignments,
but often by tho car-load. In mercantile
circles, Indianapolis is credited with haviug
the most progressive and aggressive salee
men on the road of any city in the country.
They havo tho goods that people want, and
will not be' undersold by any competing
market.
In later years the railroads have fa
vored Indianapolis merchants and manu
facturers as far as possible in rate matters,
and this has tended to greatly increase tho
business of the city. So far as its manu
facturers are concerned, their goods aro not
enly found in every State and Territory in
the Union, but iu nearly all the important
export markets. Indianapolis taws, In
dianapolis starch, Indianapolis lounges.
Indianapolis carts and buggies, and dozens
of other articles manufactured here are
shipped abroad in much larger quantities
than would be credited unless the matter
were investigated, and this is largely due to
the enterprise of the home manufacturers
and the push of the traveling selesmen.
Wholesale merchants and manufacturers
are arranging to push business next year,
increasing their force ot traveling sales
men and adding new lines of goods as thev
come on the market. They are determined,
says one of the most enterprising Meridian
Street wholesale merchants, "not to be sec
ond in the business procession."
FELLOWSHIP MEETING.
Presbyterians and CoogTegationaligU Meet
Jointly at the People's Church.
A fellowship meeting of Presbyterians and
Congregationalists was held at the Peo
ples' Congregational Church, formerly the
Fifth Presbyterian Church, at the corner
of Michigan avenue and Blackford -street,
last night This is the church which has
recently been bonght by the Congregation
alists from the Presbyterians by paying olf
the $5,000 debt with which the old Fifth
church was hardened. A consolidation has
been effected by a remaining faction of
Presbyterians staying in and uniting
with the incoming Congrcgationalists.
The latter are the members and at
tendants of the People's Congregational
Church, organized about two years ago. So
that instead of two weak, struggling
bodies there is now one strong, able church,
capable and willing for accomplishing
much good.
The pastor of the newly-consolidated
body is the Rev. Frank N. Dex
ter, who has likewise been tho
pastor of the People's Chnrch since
its organization. Tho speakers last
night were Dr. Curtis, superintendent of
the Home Missionary Society for Indiana;
Dr. Haines, of the First Tresbyterian
Church; Dr. Kondthaler, pastor of the
Tabernacle Presbyterian: the Itev. N. A.
Hyde and the Itev. J. W. Wilson.
The concensus of the remarks was that
the church ahonld now stand firm; Presby
terian and Congregationalist should clasp
hands and stand firm in the body, and tho
faith and the common cause lor which
both are striving is bound to be attained.
LIBRARIANS OF THE STATE.
An Effort Being Made to Form an Indiana As
sociation of Book Custodians.
An effort is being madeby State Librarian
Dunn and assistant Miss Ahearn to organ
ize a State Librarians Association, made up
of tho librarians, publio and private,
throughout Indiana. There aro about forty
such in the State and to each has been sent
a circular explaining the advantage of such
an organization and asking them to meet
at tho State library in tho Capitol on
Wednesday, Dec. SO. Miss Ahearn attended
the national conventionof librarians at San
Francisco in October and there learned
from the given experience of others tho
great help of snch an association to indi
vidual libraries and librarians. The an
nual discussion in convention of all the li
brarians of the State provokes new ideas
and encourages modern and advanced
methods in the management of a large li
brary, all of which conduces to the publio
good. The idea is an excellent one and the
meeting on the 30th should be a largo one.
