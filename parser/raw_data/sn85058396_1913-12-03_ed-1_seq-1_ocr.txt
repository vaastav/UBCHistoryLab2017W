! WILSON MESSAGE
IS DENOUNCED
Spanish Morning Papers in
Mexico Papers Offer Bit
ter Criticism.
EDITORIAL COMMENT
Prediction of Fall of Huerta!
Indicates Daring and Bad
Faith of President.
Mexico City, Dec. 8 An outline
of the message delivered by President
Wilson to congress at Washington
was prominently displayed by all the
Spanish morning newspapers today
The only paper printed in English,
' however, burled It on an inside page.
In commentlnK on the message, the
Independlente. which Is controlled J
by the government, says:
"The man at the White House has
dared to affirm (apalnst the truth
universally conceded) that Provision
al President Huerta is losing sym
pathy every day and that his fall Is
to be expected. It was hardly be
lievable that President Wilson would I
have the temonty to assert such a
thing. He thereby gives testimony
of his bad faith toward th'ngs Mex- !
lean."
Diplomatic officials here had no ad
vices to support published reports
that Queen Wilhelmina. speaking for
the Hague tribunal had addressed a
peace proposal to Huerta State do
partment officials were confident thai
the United States would be notified I
before a&y such proposal was made.
Only vague Impressions of the ac
tual contents of the message were I
conveyed in the dispatches published j
In the newspapers. The general Im
pression was that President Wilson
intends to keep his hands off and
leave Provisional President Huerta at
the mercy of his enemies.
To the administration and It ad
herents this course is satisfactory
They declared today that all they
desire is to he let alone The iact
that no recognition is accorueJ to
the rebels in the message seems to
be a great relief to the followers or
Huerta.
Hopes to Avoid War.
Washington, Dec. 3. During the de
bate in the house today on the I Jay
bill for raising volunteer forces In
time of actual or threatened war, Re
publican Leader Mann s.nl
"I don't see any escape from chaos
and anarchy In Mexico tinder the
p'aD we are now pursuing: If this
situation runs on very long it means
war I hope we will avoid trouble
with Mexico."

Trains Suspended.
I Mexico City, Dec. 3. The seaport
city of Tamplco was today officially
declared the temporary capital of the
state of Tamaulipas General An
tonio Iiabago. the military governor,
who was forced to abandon Ciudad
Victoria and who was erroneously
reported to have committed suicide,
has goue to Tamplco under orders
irom the federal government to re I
establish his governorship In the tern
porary capital.
The war department announced to
day that General Arizmendi and oth
er federal officers who fled from
Ciudad Victoria to Cerritos in the
state of San Luis Potosl had been
ordered to reorganize their forces
and to march against Victoria. This
task had first been entrusted to Gen
eral Navarrete, who retreated to
Monterey after his failure to relieve
me dot presseu garrison of Vic
toria.
On account of the nature of the or
ganization and equipment, as well as
the lonu distances and broken topog
raphy of the country, the federal gov
ernment will find it difficult to han
dle Its various military expeditions
without trains now that the railroads
have been practically deprived of fuel
by the oil producing companies
On some of the divisions of the
lallroad system coal may be used,
and sufficient supplies of that fuel
are available to operate trains for
some time, but at the best It Is prob
I able all traffic except military trains
shortly will be suspended.

operations in various parts of the
republic is meagre in the federal cap
