' The President's Message.
The last session of the 49th Congress
convened Monday, at 12 o'clock M. After
a formal announcement of bein iu readi
ness for business, the Senate and House
in joict assembly, the President's Mes
sage was read. It is a lengthy document
and we publish only a synopsis of the
same.
President Cleveland's message opens
with the usual survey with foreign rela
tions, and one-third of the message is de
voted to a discussion and review of for
eign relations. Our government, he says,
has consistently maintained its relations
of friendship toward all other powers and
neighborly interest toward ihose whose
possessions are contiguous to oar own.
Few questions have arisen during the past
year with other governments, and none of
those are beyond the reach of settlement
in friendly counsel. The cruel treatment
of inoffensive Chinese in the far West is
alluded to, and in speaking of a remedy,
he says, the paramount duty of maintain
ing public order and defending the inter
ests of our own people, may require the
adoption of measures of restrictions. But
they should not tolerate the oppression of
individuals of a special race. The fishery
question wbioh was alluded to in the last
message, is reiterated and the suggestions
therein recommended are re-affirmed. The
case of Cutting the El Paso editor, who
was proseouted in the Mexican courts for
libelous publication is alluded to and, a
striotly American dootrine announced.
Reaching domestic affairs, the first sub
ject discussed is the Tariff, and to this the
President devotes a great deal of space
arguing that the necessity for a reduction
of the tariff is more urgent than ever. The
income of the government he says, by its
increased volume and through economies
in its collections is now more than ever in
excess of publio necessities. The applica
tion of the surplus to the payment of such
portion of the public debt as is now at our
option subject to extinguishment, and , if
continued at the rate which has lately pre
vailed, would reduce that class of indebt
edness within less than one year from this
date. Thus a continuation of our present
revenue system would soon result in the
receipt of an annual income much greater
than necessary to meet the government
expenses, with no indebtedness upon
which it could be applied. We should
then be confronted with a vast quautity
ot money, the circulating medium of the
people hoarded in the treasury when it
should be in their bands or we should be
drawn into wasteful public extravagance
with all the corrupting national de
moralization which follows in its tiain
But it if not the simple existence of this
surplus and Us threatened attendant evil
which furnishes the strougest argument
against our present scale of federal taxa
tion. Its worst phase is the exaction of
such a surplus through a perversion of the
relations between the people and their gov
ernment, and a dangerous departure lrom
the rules which limit the right of federal
taxation. Good government, and espe
cially the -government of which every
Amerioan citizen boasts, has for its object
the protection of every person within its
oare in the greatest liberty consistent with
the good order of society and his perfect
security in the enjoyment ol his earnings
with the least possible diminution for pub
lio needs. When more of the people's sub
stance is exacted through the form of tax
ation than is necessary to meet the just
obligations of the government, and the ex
pense of its economical administration,
such exaction becomes ruthless extortion
ciple of free government. The indirect
manner in which these exaotions are made,
has a tendency to conceal their true char
acter and their extent. But we have ar
rived at a stage of superfluous revenue
which has aroused the people to a reali
zation of the fact that the amount receiv
ed professedly for the support ol the gov
ernment is paid by them as absolutely as
if added to the price of the things which
supply their daily wants ; as if it was
paid at fixed periods into the hand of the
tax gatherer, lnose who toil lor daily
wages are beginning to understand that
capital, though "somewhat vaunting its
importance and clamoring for protection
and favor of the government, is dull and
sluggish, till touched by the magical hand
of labor it springs into activity, furnish
ing an occasion for federal taxation and
gaining the value which enables it to bear
its burden, and the laboring man is
thoughtfully inquiring whether in these
circumstances, and considering the tribute
he constantly pays into the publio treasu
ry, as he supplies his daily wants, he re
ceives his fair share of advantages. There
is also a suspicion abroad that the surplus
of our revenues indicates abnormal and
exceptional business profits which, under
the system which produces such surplus
increase, is without corresponding benefit
to the publio at large. The vast accumu
lations of a few among our citizens whose
fortunes rivaling the wealth of the most
favored in anti-Democratio nations, are
not the natural growth of a steady, plain
and industrious republic. Oar farmers
too, and those engaged directly and indi
rectly in supplying the products of agri
culture, see that day by day, and as often
as the daily wants of their household re
cars, they are forced to pay excessive and
needless taxation, while their products
struggle in foreign markets with the com
petition of nations which, by allowing a
freer exchange of production than we per
mit, enable their people to sell for prices
which distress the American farmer. As
every patriotio citizen rejoices in the con
stantly increasing pride of our people in
American citizenship, and in the glory of
our national achievements and progress, a
sentiment prevails that the leading strings
n.jifnl Sn ? ft - II
umm mi m uarnuu iu its iuicuuj Ulay Well
be, to a great extent, discarded in the
present stage of American ingenuity, cour
age and fearless self-reliance, and for the
privilege of indulging this sentiment with
true American enthusiasm, our citizens
are quite willing to forego an idle sur
plus in the publio treasury, and all
the people know that the average rate
of Federal taxation upon imports is to
day in time of peace but little less, while
upon some articles of necessary cot.su mo
tion it is actually more than was imposed
by the grievous burden willingly borne
t a time when the government needed
millions to maintain, by war, the safety
And integrity of the Union. It has been
the policy of the government to collect
the principal part of its revenues by a tax
upon imports and no change in this policy
is desirable.but the present condition of af
fairs constrains our people to demand that
byarevisionofourrevenuelawa the receipts
.of the government shall be reduced to the
neoe siaryexpenseof its economical adminis
tration, and this demand should be recog
nized and obeyed by the people repre
sentatives in the legislative branch of the
government. In readjusting the burdens
of Federal taxation, a sound publio policy
requires that such of our citizens as have
bnilt up large and important industries
under present conditions should not be
suddenly and to their injury deprived of
advantages to which they have adapted
their business, but if the public good re
quires it they should be content with such
considerations as shall deal fairly and
cautiously with their interests while the
just demand of the people for relief from
needless taxation is honestly answered.
A reasonable and timely submission to
such a demand should certainly be possi
ble without a disastrous shock to any in
terest, and a cheerful concession some
times averts abrupt and heedless ac
tion often the outgrowth of impatience and
delayed justice. Due regard should be
also accorded in any proposed readjust
ment to the interests of American labor,
so far as they are involved. We con
gratulate ourselves that there is among
us no laboring class fixed within unyield
ing bonds and doomed under all condi
tions to the inexorable fate of daily toil.
We recognize in laber a chief factor in the
wealth of the republic, and we treat those
who have it in their keeping, as citizens
entitled to the most careful regard . and
thoughtful attention. This regard and
attention should be awarded them not
only because labor is the capital of work
ing meo, and justly entitled to its share
of government favor, but for the further
and not less important reason that the
laboring man surrounded by his family in
his humble home as a consumer is vitally
interested in all that cheapens the cost of
living and enables him to bring within his
domestic circle additional comforts and
advantages. This relation of the work
ingmen to the revenue laws oi the coun
try, and the manner in which it palpably
influences the question of wages, should
not be forgotten in the justifiable promi
nence given to the proper maintenance of
the supply and protection of well paid
labor, and these considerations suggest
such an arrangement of government reve
nue as shall reduce the expense of living,
while it does noj. curtail the opportunity
for work nor reduce the compensation of
American labor and injuriously afiect
its condition and the dignified place it
holds in the estimation of our people.
But the farmers and agriculturists, those
who from the noil product) the things con
sumed by all, are perhaps more directly
and plainly concerned than any other
of our citizens in a just and caretul sys
tem of federal taxation, lhose actually
engaged in and more remotely connected
with this kind of work number nearly
one-half of our population. None labor
harder or more continuously than they;
no enactments limit their hours oi ton and
no interposition of the government en
hances to any great extent the value of
their products, and yet for many of the
necessaries anewjom torts of life which the
most scrupulous economy enables them to
bring into their homes, and for their 1m
plements of husbandry they are obliged
to pay a price largely increased by an un
natural profit which by the action of the
government is given to the more lavored
manufacturer.
I recommend that keeping in view all
these considerations, the increasing and
unnecessary surplus of the national in
come, annually accumulating, be released
to the people by an amendment to our
revenue laws, which shall cheapen the
price oi the necessaries of life and give
freer entrance to such imported materials
as by American labor may be manufac
tured into marketable commodities. Noth
ing can be accomplished however in the
direction ot this much needed reform un
less toe suojeci is approached in a pa
triotio spirit of devotion to the interests
of the entire eountry and with a willing
ness to yield something for the public
good.
Less space is devoted to the silver ques
tion this year than last, but his opposition
to compulsory coinage is no less pro
nounced. Ihe difference in the bullion
price of the standard dollar 94 cents
when first coined, and its bullion value
78 cents, on the 30th ot last November
certainly does not indicate, the President
says, that compulsory coinage by the gov
ernment enhances the price of that com
modity, or secures uniformity injts value
He has seen no reason to change his views
expressed a year ago on the 'subject of
compulsory coinage, and again urges its
suspension on all the grounds contained in
his former recommendations, reinforced
by the significant increase of our gold ex-
portations during the last year, and for
the further reasons that the more this cur
rency is distributed among the people, the
greater becomes our duty to protect it
from disaster; and that we now have an
abundance for all our needs, and that
there seems but little propriety u build
ing vaults to store such currency when
the only pretense for its coinage is the
necessity of its use by the people as a cir
culating medium.
Of the coast defense and fortifications
the President says the defenseless condi
tion of oar sea coast and lake frontier is
perfectly palpable and the works laid cut
by the board on fortifications is delayed
in default of Congressional action. The
absolute necessity of our preparation for
effectual resistance against armed ships
and modern steel guns which may threat
en our seacoast cities is so apparent that
be hopes effective steps will be taken in
that direction at once. The condition of
our navy as shown by the Secretary of
that department should challenge the ear
nest attention of Congress.
Postal service affairs show a marked and
gratifying improvement during the past
year. The increase of revenue is in a gain
ing ratio over the increase of cost, demon
strating the sufficiency of the present
cneap rates ot postage ultimately to sus
tain the service.
Of the relations of labor to capital, the
President thinks that when these differ
ences between employer and employed
reach such a stage as to result in the in
terruption of commerce between the States
the application of arbitration by the gen
eral government might be regarded en
tirely within its constitutional power, and
he thinks we might reasonably hope that
such arbitration, if carefully selected, and
if entitled to the confidence of the parties
to be affected, would be voluntarily call
ed to the settlement of controversies of
less extent and not necessarily within the
domain of Federal regulation. The Presi
dent recommends as a plain duty on the
part of the Government the payment of a
million and a quarter dollars still due to
the Freeman's Savings Bank, depositors.
The President says oar Civil Service
Reform may be imperfect in some of its
details ; it may be misunderstood and op
posed ; it may iiot always be faithfully
applied ; its designs may sometimes mis
carry; through mistake or willful intent it
may sometimes tremble nnder the assaults
of its enemies or languish under the - mis- i
at
if the people of this country ever submit
to the banishment of iu underlying prin
ciples from the operation of their govern
ment, they will abandon the surest safe
guard of the safety and success ot Ameri
can institutions. '
In conclusion, I earnestly invoke such
wise action on the part of the people's
legislators as will subserve the publio
good and demonstrate during the remain
ing days of Congress as at present organ
ized its ability and inclination to so meet
tha naonla'a need that it shall be grateful-

Offices for the Whites.
The bouleversement of races consequent
apon emancipation has produced conse
quences to be expected from the motives
which influenced the liberators, ana the
expectations inspired in the liberated. The
fundamental idea with ihe first was that
the negro, the man and brother, unright
eously restrained, be it said, from his crea
tion, from the rights ol freedom, when in
vested with that inestimable gift, became
at once the social and political equal of
the white man. Not uuuaturally the ne
gro was prompt to accept the admission,
and made haste to avail himself of all the
privileges it brought with it.
The most profitable use of these privi
leges was, ot course, political recognition
and advancement. Ibis the partv in pew
er was more than ready to grant. It was
greedy to demonstrate the sincerity of its
convictions of race equality ; earnest to
prove its devotion to the oause ot an op
pressed people ; eager to pro tier compeu
sation tor long denied rights ; and not at
all slow to humiliate the oppressors by
putting in power over them those so long
cowering under the lash of slavery.
Time enough has passed for the popu
lar temper to recover its equilibrium, time
enough to examine whether our institu
tions should be subjected to this discor
dant clash of race ambition ; lime enough
to question whether the white race ib call
ed upon to abdicate its right and claim to
direct the affairs of the country ; time
enough to ask whether the grave and mo
mentous interests ot the country shall be
imperilled by the demands of sentimen
talism. For it is nothing more than sen
timentalism, sickly or depraved, that de
mands the sudden and immediate eleva
tion oi a people buried, since the lime that
history bad a record, in the depths ot slav
ery and barbarism, to the heights and
rights attained by the white race after
oenturiesot struggle with tyranny. learn
ing by experience the cost and value of
liberty ; and groping then way with pain
ful step from the lowest depths of intel
lectual darkness to the brightest efful
gence of mental light.
Does it stand to reason that those bless
ings attained with so much cost should be
carelesBly shared with those who have had
freedom thrust upon them without effort
of their own, and whose gnlightment is on
ly the dim reflection of the mental rush
light ?
Now we take the position unequivocal
ly, that this is the white man's country,
and this, ihe white man's government :
the one subdued by the white man's val
or and the energy ; the other created by
the white man's courage, intelligence and
spirit of liberty.
The'infusion of the negro element into
the field of politics, and into rights of of
ficial rewards, is a gross interpolation of
offensive incongruities. It is enough for
the negro that he has been liberated from
slavery ; that has been invested with the
full rights of citizenship; that he is fully
protected in those rights ; that he can
acquire, hold and enjoy property, the
fruits of his own labor ; that be can ac
quire education ; and that he has the op
portunity intelligently to exercise the
rights and duties of citizenship. But he
has yet acquired no right to be called as a
ruler over us.
We admit the remarkable development
made by individuals ot African blood. Ac
quirements in learning, iu oratory, in
in thrift are somewhat startling. But
these do not alter the case, and in fact are
only insolated and exceptional, and do not
justify breaking down the barrier whioh
instinct, if nothing more, erects against
the intrusion of other races and other peo
ple into the administration of public af
fairs. The American mind is fixed against
commingling with other blood ; it resents
the intrusion ot other races. Right un
der the eye of the government at Wash
ington, are Chinese officials as astute, as
intellectual, as cultivated, as ad riot and
skillful diplomats as the world present.
Yet as Chinese, they are sooially ostra
cized, and their race proscribed. The
Chinese bad the intelligence and the meth
od to create a civilization, peculiar to it
self, but the wonder of mankind. They
lived to themselves in close seclusion and
built up a power which has stood strong
and unchanged for thousands of years.
The negroes with a continent to themselves
through the same period, made no farther
advance in civilization than the apes that
shared the forests with them, and only be
came known to civilization as they were
dragged out from the depths of the inte
rior to supply the material for the slave
markets ot the world.
Yet in VV ashington, where the Chinese
is ostracised, the negro is defied almost,
elevated to office, and made the arbiter of
social and official destiny.
We call Tor a" change. We must see the
sole claim of the white man recognized.
We cannot tolerate the idea of negro su
periors over' needy whites. We abhor the
idea that negro officials rhould lord it
over white females. We want and must
have an official list uncontaminated with
the touch of another race. We want a
white man's government, National and
State.
If there were no other reason, the one of
moral unfitness would prevent itself. Of
this there are illustrations abundant
enough to be furnished. As an abstract
question of parlies, in their choice we
would be brought to discriminate but
lightly between the two, if both recognized
the equal right of the negro to a share in
the offices.
We have the kindliest feeling for the
negro. We would encourage and aid him
in bis moral, mental and material '.advan
tage in every possible way. We rejeice
in his liberation from slavery, and rejoice
id the proper use of his freedom.
But for all this, do not make him ruler
over us, either in great things or in small.
