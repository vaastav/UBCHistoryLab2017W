The Journal of last Friday in com
menting on the fact that a week of the
session of congress had almost passed
and there had been no noise like a
scrap in the republican ranks said:
"As a nation we like to see the fur fly,
and hear the yells of the combatants- Polishers and the growth of maga
but lo! the always veracious dispatch- ^nes-
While we do not think it was inten
tional on the part of the Journal nev
ertheless we feel that they spoke a
truth in this regard: Taft probably
does not want any kind of trouble*.
That is very commendable of the pres
ident. The U. S. congress is assem
bled not to fight, like a democratic
convention, but to make laws for the
people of the United fcSates who, not
withstanding there may be a few ex
ceptions, are a peacable nation, who
would rather see harmony and unity
the governing body at Washington
than a see-saw sort of democratic tac
tics where there is nothing accom
plished and a lot of dissension stirred
up.
word. Rudy&td Kipling is supposed to
receive the highest prices paid any
author of fiction. For the English
and American serial rights of "Kim,"
he received $25,000. Sir Arthur Con
an Doyle hit one of the highest marks
when he received sixty cents a word
for the American serial rights of his
latest "Sherlock Holmes" stories. This
compares amusingly with the rate of
$2 per thousand words—or one-fifth of
a cent a word—received for his first
and generally considered best stories.
High prices for literary work be
gan practically with the great success
of Sir Walter Scott. The compensa
tion for his "Life of Bonaparte," aver
aged $165 for each day of work spent
upon it.
Thackeray was offered $1,000 for
."Henry Esmond," and he jumped at
the proposition. Both Dickens and
Hugo made good money, but when
Eugene Sue drew $20,000 for his
"Wandering Jew"—a novel of probab
ly upwart of 500,000 words—the liter
