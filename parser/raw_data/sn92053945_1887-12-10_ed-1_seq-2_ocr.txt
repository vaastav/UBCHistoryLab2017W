Anest the postl telegraph question
the Galveston Neva, democratic, remarks:
Tht a number of democratic papers are
adTocatinfr, a government telegraph may
be partly due to want of reflection on the
dangers of political control oer such a
facility of communication. With a dem
ocratic administration at Washington the
writers may not think of this as they
would do if Mr. Blaine or any other re
publican were In the white house.
Quoting Senator Cullom's alarmist state
men I that business secrets are now at the
mercy of the man who controls the tele
graph, the Chicago Timet makes some
sensible comments upon the subject
There must always be men, either official
or unofficial, who will have power to read
messages sent over the lines. The tele
graph in the "hands of the people" is a
pretty idea. It may be put in the hands
of elected agents. They as men will be
men, and may abue their trust as much
as any officers of a corporation. Politi
cal motives would always be present to
officials. Business motives might also
be complicated with these. Peo
ple like Senator Cullom appear
to see nothing which is alter
native. They note a fact and call for a
change, though the change would he hut
a jump from the frving pan iuto the Are.
The government is trusted to carry let
ten. To trust it with control over the
telegraph would be to give the parly in
office a power equivalent to opening let
ters and reading them. One of the
strongest objections to a change from
private to political management of the
telegraph is the fact that whereas a cor
poration can be sued and its officers can
be indicted as criminals when they are
known to be guilty, the government, on
the contrary, cannot be sued like a cor
poration, in the state courts, and official
acts are rarely to be made the ground of
indictment except at the instance of the
party in power, which has the records,
the most important evidence in iis hands.
and is always disposed in eras of corrup
tion to shield its own creatures in their
misdeeds. The democrats who favor a
government telegraph do not appear to
have studied the political any more than
the real business aspects of the proposed
departure .

THAT DOXOLOGY CRANK.
Be Creates a Diversion at the White House
Rev. Burchard, or 1884.
Washington Crrr, Dec. 10. The man who
sang the Doxology in the house of representa
tives last Monday got into the long line of
members of the Evangelical alliance, who
were waiting on the portico at the White
House Friday to be received by the president
and Mrs. Cleveland. Before he reached the
door be broke out in a loud voice and sang
the Doxology, creating something of a sensa
tion. He sang the four lines through once,
and was about to repeat them when the po
lice led him out of the line, and be started
way apparently in good humor. He said be
wanted to get a patent through, and when the
polios had conducted him to the street outside,
he exclaimed: "Bless the Lord. Til secure
my patent yet"
The president received the members of the
Christian conference and made them a little
speech in approval of the purposes of their
meeting, after which they were introduced
to himself and Mrs. Cleveland.
The Rev. ir. Burchard, of New York, of
the "three RV fame, was among those pre
sented. The president recognised him at
oca, and advancing toward him said, with
considerable earnestness and fervor, that he
was very glad to see him, whereupon the
crowd of delegates broke out into laughter.
The reception, which took place in the
East room of the mansion, lasted for more
than a hour. The president and Mrs. Cleve
land shook hands with each of the callers as
they passed by and weie introduced by Dr.
Dodge and CoL Wilson. The first to grasp
the band of the president was Dr. McCosh;
then followed in rapid succession nearly
,000 gentlemen and ladies.
The conference held day and night sessions
and discussed Co-operation in Christian work.

the work met at his residence for the pur
pose of oonfarriac with Albert Griffln, ohair-
man of the anti-saloon Republican national
committee of New York. No effort was made

ject.
The Latest "It Is Reported."
Washington Crrr, Dec 10. It has been

Is Gen. r itlers answer:
Yours atkinsr my consent and signature to
an invitation to the Comte de Parts to deliver
the address at Gettsburg I answer by tele
graph as requested. I am too American,
and 1 nope too mucn oi a sotaier or. tue war
of the rebellion, to invite a Frenchman who,
because be was a prince, was permitted to
play soldier for his own aggrandisement on
the staff of a commanding general in that
war, and who as such officer was at one time
at the head of that general's bureau of infor
mation, and for want of knowledge of the
peculiarities of our people and the idioms of
our language, did his commander, as I hap
pen to know, treat mischief, to speak for the
armies of the United States at the reunion at
Gettysburg. I would rather agree to any of
ficer of the rank of colonel or above who
served through the war to t such representa

Eac Claire, Wis., Dec. 10. The Wash
ington dispatch published in several western
newspapers Thursday, and quoting The New
York Times editorial charging CoL Vilas
with direct connection, through a brother,
with the alleged California redwood land
frauds, embodies a serious error of The
Times. The Joseph Vi lee who was a pur
chaser of redwood lands, is not only not a
brother of CoL v ilas, but bears no relation
whatever to him. The name is spelled dif
ferently. This Joseph Vil-s is a wealthy
lumberman, whose home is at Augusta, this
county, and who is now in Humboldt coun
ty, CaL, where he is watching his redwood
purchases.

reporter interviewed a number of representa
tive Irish-Americans Friday on their posi
tion in the matter of the en ter tai n men t of Jo
seph Chamberlain by Washington society,
which was so vigorously denounced at a
meeting of Irishmen Thursday night. The
general opinion was that no insult should be
offered Chamberlain, but that such proceed
ings as Thursday night's would do good in
showing that the American people were for
home rule, a fact that was likely to be ob
scured by the attentions paid the Britisher.

SOMEBODY PERJURED.
HARPER TAKES THE WITNESS STAND
IN HIS OWN BEHALF.
He Flatly Contradicts Uater Oath the
Stories That Wllshlre and Eckert Told
A Bunt of Emotion Arensdorf Is Inno
cent, Says the Jury at Sioux City A
Sprinter's Criminal Break.
Cincinnati, Ohio, Deo. 30. At his own
request, as he stated to the judge when asked
the question, E. Ll Harper took the witness
stand Friday to testify in his own behalf be
fore a crowded court room, many of the au
dience being ladies. He began by stat
ing that he knew Wilshire, with a
smile that seemed to say, "I wish I
didn't" and then proceeded to deny every
thing that Wilshire said in his testimony so
far as it implicated Harper in the wheat
deal. He went over the transactions
between Wilshire and the Fidelity bank, ex
plaining that they all involved the borrow
ing of money by Wilshire and others, and
that witness did not have a cent of interest
in their deal!. He declared that when be
found that Wilshire had overdrawn his ac
count he did all he could to have him square
up and refused to let him have any more
money, although Wilshire begged for it
Then, white witness was absent from the
bank, W ilshire got some more money from
Hopkins. Hearing this Harper was frantic.
He stormed at Wilshire, but could get noth
ing out of him. He then suggested to the
cashier to take a call loan from Wilshire, Eek
ert & Co., to square their account and save
the cashier.
In answer to direct questions from Mr.
Blackburn Mr. Harper stated unreservedly
that he never gave an order of any kind to
Mr. Eckert to buy grain for him in Chicago,
and he was equally sweeping and explicit in
saying that he never authorized Mr. Wilshire
to buy grain for hrm in Chicago or elsewhere.
This is the point of the whole case, and is in
direct conflict with the testimony of both Mr.
Wilshire and Mr. Eckert
Harper then came to the time of the great
crash. "Very early on the morning of the
14th of. June, be said, ilshire came to my
residence and said: They have changed the
rules on me in Chicago and can unload wheat
anywhere and still it will be regular. They
are trying to unload all the wheat of the
northwest on me.' He wanted 2UU,uuu more
money. I told him I would not loan him 300
cents more. 1 told him be had deceived. i
had cheated me; he had lied to me; he
had robbed the bank. I came up to
the bank and there 1 found a telegram
from St Louis asking if there was
a run on the institution. I went to dine.
Ben Hopkins followed me in, and Wilshire
was there before my dinner had arrived, I
went downstairs and went into the wash-room.
They followed me, both of them, with tears in
their eyes, and said everything would be lost
if I did not give them this money; that the
shrinkage up to that time made a difference
of 91,000,0)10. Hopkins suggested that we
telegraph a bank in Chicago asking how
much they would take to see the deal
through. Hopkins accordingly went and tel
egraphed the American Exchange bank of
Chicago, as I understand. When I got back
from dinner there was a telegram there from
the American Exchange National bank, of
Chicago, saying if Wilshire would be
there with $'OJ,o0u in the morning it
would tteall right Wilshire, Hopkins and I
talked the matter over, and we decided to
save the bank. We also acted on the strength
of another telegram that Wilshire had re
ceived from his principal up there, that if
the money was paid wheat woukl go up 10
cents. Wilshire was afraid to go to Chicago
alone with the funds lest the money should
be attached, so Hopkins telegraphed J. W.
Hoyt at Delphi to accompany Wilshire to
Chicago. I instructed Hoyt and WiUhire
that the drafts and credits be not given np to
the Chicago bank on any consideration un
less the bank would guarantee that our bank
should be held safe. Still worried about the
matter I found Gahr and told him that Wil
shire would be on the train with $"U0
uot), which I wanted him (Gahr) to take pos
session of and see that Wilshire set a proper
guarantee before be turned it over in Chica
go. He found Wilshire. The next morning
1 went to our bank and telegraphed that I
was afraid they would give up the papers
without the proper guarantee, but it was too
late. I received a telegram from Wilshire
stating that the letters of credit and the
checks had been turned over the Chicago
bank had taken the papers and used them
to save itself from Kershaw's deficiency.
Pavment was afterward stopped on the
drafts."
Here Harper became much affected; his
voice was choked by sobs and hut frame
shook with emotion. "I got together," he
said, "all my individual resources to save the
bank. But the run began. The officers of
the bank hastened to pull out beating the
public in this regard. They never made the
iligbtest effort to save the bank with their
individual resources. They pulled out the
money 1 dumped in. Finally, June 3u, Gen.
Power came. I told him it would be ruinous
to examine the bank at this time. He said
that if, by 8 o'clock the next morning $500,
01)0 was raised the bank could remain
open. 1 offerad to raise $J0,0iM and

ARENSDORF GOES ACQUIT.
The Jury Def .de That He Did Not Kill
Haddock.
Slocx CiTT, Iowa, Dec. 10. The jury in the
ise of John Arensdorf, on trial for the
ond time on the charge of murdering Rev.
Haddock, brought in a verdict Friday night
at 9 o'clock, finding the defendant not guilty.
The court room was about half filled with
a crowd which which was swiftly gathered,
as the news of tba agreement of the jury
spread. There was a slight demonstration
the court room, but four out of
of the spectators refused to join
in it. As soon as the verdict was an
nounced ArensdorPs counsel moved for his
discharge, and the motion was granted. The
defendant's counsel grasped bis hand, but be
harried away from them to thank the members
of the jury, who bad been dismissed by the
court. It m safe to say that this verdict
finally and forever disposes of the Haddock
murder case, and that the man who actually
fired the shot will never be punished in the
world. -
Sprinted " with the Cash.
Indianapolis, lnd., Dec, 10. Late Friday
afternoon Frank firehm, of Akron, Ohio,
and John Cross, of Bhelbyville, this state,
went with a party of friends to the ball park
for a sprinting match, the stakes amouting
to fUOU. Tom McKlen, of i oungstown,
Ohio, acted as stakeholder. The parties
made a good run, and Cross was about to
come out a foot or two ahead, when Brehm
shouted "tool," and turning to the stakeholder
the two men jumped into a hack and left the
grounds. Several shots were fired at the oc
cupants of the hack as it was driven rapidly
away. Bo far as known no one was hurt,
Several local sports are also heavy losers, as
McKlen held stakes for a number of parties
besides the money put up by the backers of
the principals.

CARNOT SELECTS A WEAK MAN TO
MAKE HIS CABINET,
Who Gets the Jub Done, However Sing
ger Sullivan Mukee Friend with the
British Heir ApparentScotch Home
Rulers on Ireland A Monument fa'
veiled at Night.
Paris, Dec. 10. Fallieres has almost com
pleted the construction of a cabinet which,
ubject to po sible slight modifications, will
stand as follows: Fallieres, president of the
council and minister of the interior; Kouvier,
minister of finance; Flourens, minister of
foreign affairs: Gen. Ferron, minister of
war: Barbey, minister of marine; Spuller,
minister of public instruction; Baliant, min
ister of public works: Fave, minister of justice;
Dontresine, minister of commerce, and De
velle, minister of agriculture. The minister
of posts and telegraphs has not yet been desig
nated.
The fact that there is a lack of cohesion
among the French Republican factions which
is almost hopeless is abundantly evidenced by
President Carnol's ill success in forming a
cabinet, and his nomination of Fallieres to
undertake the work abandoned by Goblet
confirms the desperate straits in which
the president finds himself. Fallieres
proverbially a weak man in respect of
everything that combines to constitute
statesman, and could not in any circum
stances command the robast respect neces
sary to control the chamber in bis capacity
as premier. He occupied the position of
prime minister on a previous occasion for a
rriod of ten days, and on t..e eleventh day,
while addressing the chamber, completely
collapsed and came very near dying from the
effects of over-exertion and worriment, his
brain temporarily given away. It is
believed by many who admire the gentle
man's personal qualities that Fdllieres has
never fully recovered from that attack
and confi lently predicted that he will per
manently lose his miud should he again at
tempt to nil an ofnea much too broad m its
scope for his mental grasp To men not thor
oughly imbued with the idea that the presi
dent is wholly ingenuous, it -is evident that
Carnot a seeking a weak and inoffensive
man as premier, hoping thus to control
the min istry hi msel f , wb i ie the strong
men in the cabinet be would place in subor
dinate positions. Such a combination would
doubtless work well if the strong men could
be induced to submit to Carnot domination,
but this seems to be farther r Jaoved from
possibility than even the harmonizing of the
Ke ublican groups, and anotner presiden
tial election may be found necessary as a
means of terminating the crisis, which does
not seem to have been finally dissipated by
the peaceful election of Grevy's successor.
A Scotch Home Bole View.
Glasgow, Dec. 10. The delegates of the
Scotch home rule union, who have been
making a tour of Ireland, have returned, and
report that the Irish people are eager for
peace; that their demands are moderate, and
that the National league is the chief agency
for the maintenance of law and order. 1 hey
say they are convinced that the Irhh are
home rulers and not searatista, so one in
Ireland fears religious persecution. 1 be del
egates declare that the measures taken by the
present English government are ineffective
and irritate the mm of the Irish nation.

de&ire the government to give us our com
mercial rights therein as it aba.l define them.

commission has submitted to Governor Og let-
by a report stating that, in their opinion, the I
"train would not have been destroyed if the
bridge had rot burned before tbe train
reached it." They found no evidence to
show that tbe burning was the work of an in- I
