: FINANCIAL NEWS
AND COMMENT
Stock Market Remains Buoyant,
Aided Little by President's
Message.
President Harding's message to Congress,
the outstanding feature of yestor'
day's news, found reflection In tho stock
market In a small way only. It Influenced
some further short covering and
perhaps some pool operations which
wore more or loss in the character of
: "feelers." It failed, however, to eni
courage any Important public participation
in stocks, and could not have been
expected to considering the length of
timo which tho public has stood passively
aside while profesBlonals directed
the course of prices. It takes the cumulative
effects of several constructive
developments such as the message to
Congress to stir Into action the outside
interest which has been dormant for so
long.
Nevertheless the general Jlst of stocks
advanced from 1 to 3 points. The railroad
group continued soft, a further
unsatisfactory development respecting
the carriers having been supplied by
tho tendency of certain roads to advance
wages. The tendency appears to he
upward once more, and the railroads as
! a class have not made reductions from
the peak of wages established during
the period of inflation sufficient to per|
mil them to advance pay again to any
material extent without a decided impairment
of their earning position. It is
quite unlikely that publication of the
complete OcLober earnings figures was a
factor in yesterday's weakness of rails,
for virtually all the statement* of ln
dividual roads had been made public
previously.
Another day of study of the Federal
| Government's new financing plan seemsd
! to have added to the belief that It was
| a forecast of easier money conditions
j after the turn of tho year, and as a
' result tho high grade Investment market
was moderately active and definitely
1 strong. United Slates Government obligations
were stronger in tone than
they have been for some time, and high
grade railroad bonds were in substantial
demand. Speculative bonds, howaver,
were subject to considerable pressure.
soma of which Is likely to have been
tax selling'.
Exchange on London eased slightly
in yesterday's market, but this was a
development which must have been expected
after several days of steady
and sharp advances. The process of
the recent markets, in which sterling
advanced while francs and lire declined,
was reversed yesterday. The Continental
exchanges were quite strong,
French francs selling above 7.09 and
lire again above 5 cents. A feature of
the exchange market was the Norwegian
rate, which got above 19 cents, apparently
following the Swedish krona,
which three days before crossed its
point of parity with the United States
1 dollar.
Commodity prices were strong, both
grain and cotton quotations moving
! substantially above Thursday's final tlg:
ifirs. Money cased off for the first time
I this week, and after opening at G per
cent... unchanged from Thursday's close,
hacked down to 4 per cent. It was the
same old story?funds from the Interior
attracted by the high call rate on the
Stock Exchange. And It probably will
he the same old story regarding their
; withdrawal when the rate drops so low
| as to eliminate the element of attractlvc|
ncss.
As was to be expected at this eegs->n
! of the year, the principal place In trade
| Is being occupied at the moment by retail
business. Of course, the large volume
of Christmas buying and Christmas
advertising has stimulated this situation.
but colder weather, too, has had
its effect, the woekly reviews point out.

TOPICS OF WAIL STREET.
BuiltMd Labor Board.
Railroad officials and railroad bankera
read with Jieen Interest and hearty
approval the suggestion contained in
President Harding's message to Congress
, that the labor board be abolished
and a labor branch be added to
tho Interstate Commerce Commission
oonslstlng of four members. It has
long been held In this district that
the labor board failed In Its original
purpose since Its work did not coordinate
with that of the Interstate Commerce
Commission. The hope was expressed
that* Congress would follow th?
suggestion of the Chief Executive In
the matter.
Freight Congest|on Less.
Recent reports by prominent Eastern
lines Indicated a gradual lessening of
the freight congestion which was apparent
as soon as coal started to move
In September. Most lines which handled
coal in largo quantities took to the
embargo system as a way out. While
It Is expected that little In tho way
of removing the embargoes will bo attempted
until after the turn of the
year the situation at present is much
more _ favorable from the carriers'
point x>f view, -tyl roads report that
traffic Is being maintained at a record
rate for this tlino of year.
Call Money Easier.
The feature of the money market yesterday
was the decline In call money
rates from B per cent, to 4 per cent.
In the New York Stock Exchange. Tho
1 per cent, rate Is tho lowest mark for
call money In several weeks. Tho time
money market continued unchanged,
with thirty day loans quoted at 4% per
cent, and longer maturities commanding
1 per cent. Money Is plentiful at 5 per
cent., but brokers apparently are not
ready to borrow at that rato.
United States Steel Tonnage.
The monthly report of the forward I ,
business df the United States Steel Cor- |
juration, announcement of which will
to made to-day. Is expected to show i
little If any appreciable change front
that of the preceding month. A week ,
jr so ago the general expectation hi the
trade was that the corporation would
thow an Increase In the neighborhood of
150,000 tons. These calculations were
based on a study of bookings and shipnents
supposed to have been made In
the" first twenty-four days of the month,
rn the final six days of the month, howsver,
there was a falling off In Incoming
business and on Thanksgiving day
he corporation continued uninterrupted
jpemtlons, but booked no new business.

The President's Message.
Wall Street approved most of the
jrlncipal points In President Harding's
"????"? TII? vIowm conrnrnlnc lmmi
^ration were not entirely in accord with
those held by many Wall Street men,
who felt that the immigration quotas
should be enlarged rather than restricted.
The President's remarks rdWding
tax exempt securities confirmed
the theories generally held in banking
circles that some legislation restricting
their issuance is now Inevitable. Indeed,
tome preparations for meeting such an'
emergency already are being made.
Dntte and Superior Dividend.
Directors of the Butto and Superior
Mining Cynpany declared yestercjay a
dividend of 00 cents a share, payable
Docember 20 to stockholders of record
December IB. Tlio last previous dividend
was $1.25 a share, paid on September
29. 1917. An official atatement
Issued said that while the profits for
the entire calendar year will be very
small, due to losses and shutdown expenses,
as shown in the quarterly reports
for the early part of the year, the
Increase in production plus the advance
ir* Iho nrlnA nf tinwas now nhrmiftlnir
the company to show reasonable profits
in excess of the dividend at the rate declared.
The statement added that the
cash position of the company was exceedingly
dtrong'.
Kress Sales Gain.
Sales of S. H. Kress Company during
November totaled $2,582,053, an Increase
of $196,908 over November, 1921.
This brought the aggregate sales for the
first eleven months of the current year
up to $25,172,107, an increase of $1,017,893
over those of the corresponding
eleven months of the preceding year.
Rati Meeting Rontlne.
According to the first few railroad
executives who reached town last night
Thursday's meeting at Chicago was routine
and consideration of the policy program
which liad been arranged by the
special conimH'SC was. to use tlm words
of one ofllelai, "cut and dried." One
point Mill remains to he cleared up and
that Is whether the special committee
which decided on the future of the association
will continue as the cxecutlvo
committee to manage the association or
whether the regular executive committee
of the organization will function lK ttils
capacity. *
Equipment Inquiries,
lActlvlty In the locomotive market was
lesa pronounced last week, according to
Railway Aye, which reports an order
by Denver and Rio Grande Western for
twenty-five locomotives and an Inquiry
for sixty-flve from the Canadian National
Railways. Other business was
divided among a number of Industrial '
companies, whose needs, Judged by the
orders, are moderate. The Canadian
National also figures prominently In the
matter of Inquiries forV freight cars,
about 1.300 being Bought at present.
I?arge orders placed laat week Included
3.COO by Northern Pacific and 1.200 by
Cotton. Belt, with 2,000 to St. Paul, and

Tobacco Products Earnings.
In tha first eleven monUha of 1922
shipments of cigarettes by the Tobacco
Product# Corporation' Increased approximately
per cent, over the correspond
In* eleven. month* of 1921. Current
shipment* are showing a still larger proportionate
Increase, the hulk of tho gain
In the eleven months' period having been
shown In the laet four months. On the
basis of earnings for the eleven months
It Is estimated, that the full year's
operations will'result In a surplus of
approximately $3,601,000 after all fixed
charges and dividends. This would bring
the company's profit and loss surplus up'
to $0,000,000.

November production of steel Ingots
hy thirty companies, which In 1021 produced
97.5 per cent, of the country's
total output, amounted to 2,980,297 tons,
according to the American Iron and
Steel Institute. This represents an Increase
of 18,892 tons over October's production
of 2.872.415 and Is the largest
monthly total since October, 1920. when
output reached 3,015,982 tons. In November,

NEW HAVEN TO PILE
VALUATION PROTEST
Will Tell I. 0. C. That It Ha?
Omitted Important Items
in Fixing Total.
The New York, N?w Haven and Hart,
ford Railroad Company, through A O.
Auckland, vice-president and geo**?l
counsel, announced yesterday that a protect
against the tentative valuation of
the road as determined by the Interstate
Commerce Commission would be filed
with the commission by tha first of the
year. Mr. Buckland indicated that the
protest against valuation would be directed
against the straight line method
of depredation applied by the commission
and also the omission from the
findings of many important elements of
val tie.
Tji? company views as one of the
most, important omissions the failure
by the commission to allow any value
for the company's ri0kts In perpetuity
between Woodlawn and Grand Central
Station and the road's Investment '
therein. /
In his statement. Mr. Buckland points
out that the commission as of June .".ft.
vaiueri me roaa ai ?oo.,<ai.win,
covering only the value of the carrier
properly used, and a value of $3,600.3^0
covering carrier property owned by New
Haven and Its leased lines, but not used
on account of being leased to other carriers.
A value of $17,670,568 for noncarrier
property and leased lines was reported
but not included In tlio total.
"Included in tho commission's tentative
ligure was an amount of $9,369,342, '
representing the actual balance of cash
and materials and supplies on hand as
shown by the carrier's balance sheet of
Juno 30. 1915," Mr. Buckland added.
"On December 31, 1921, the balance
sheet showed cash on hand, $10,306,046,
and materials and supplies. $14,319,089,
a total of $24,625,135. Thus there was
an Increase In valuo on account of these
Items of $15,255,793."
Inclusion of this Item together with
another $50,880,718 for additions and bet- ,
ternients between June 80, 1915, and December
31, 1921, gives a lotal as of
December 31. 1921. of $469,172,221, which
Is comparable"with the road and equipment
account and the book value of
materials and supplies and cash for
the same period, amounting to $398,7ft4
"A? trivlni* an rTMsa valiiA nvf>r ilm
property account of $70,468,019.
Mr. Auckland further says that the
not capital obligations of New Haven
and leased linos as of tlio last day of
last year adjusted to exclude the par
value of the butstandlng system obligations
hold5' by the system companies
amount to $507,093,466, which includes
capital obligations representing Securities
Issued to aocqutre so-called
outside properties not Included In . the
valuation and carried at a book value
of $155,241,204, which In turn If deducted
from the net capital obligations as of
December 31, 1921. would leave $351,852,261,
giving an excess of propert;
value over iheae net capital oblige
tions amounting to 1117,319.900.
"This would work out an equity rt
about |175 per share for the VKMb,<OS
stock of New Haven," declaims Mr. I
Buckland. "Even If the balaaer of
the outside Investments were taken nt
only 60 per cent, of hook value, tljt
equity a or wew naven block woujj
btill work out at about $146 per share."
UNION PACIFIC WOULD
BUY CENTRAL PACIFIC
Lovett Makes Admission tot
Hearing Before I. C. C. y
Washington, Dea 8.?Officials of the
Union Paclfio system made direct arguments
before the Interstate Commerce
Commission to-day, urging the separation
of the Central Pacific Railroad from
the present Southern Paclfio system, an
ordered by the Supreme Court. Judge
R. S. Lovett, chairman of the board of
the. Union Pacific, and H. M. Adorns,
Its vice-president, opposed the petition
of the Southern Pacific, while P. M.
Finch, general superintendent of the
Oregon-Washington Railroad and Navigation
Company, testified on the practicability
of joint uso of tracks and facilities
by the two roads.
The Union Pacific, Judge Lovett said,
was willing to buy the Central system,
but was not seeking to do so. He declared
largo expenditure^ made through
"many agencies" by his company to Influence
public sentiment to support the
separation decree were justified by a
Hon Ol war fCIWIMMI tMU UIIIOII ?I1>1
Southern Pai-ltlc systems over the Central
property. Ho expressed the opinion
that the Central company vas capa- _ |
bio of earning Its owir^vay.
COOL WEATHER GIVES j

Oeneml buslnees condition* continue
fair, acording to th<| Weekly trade reviews,

winter, heavy wearing apparol, foot- / 1
wear and holiday specialties predominating
again," declares ttradstrect'a, at
the mm me timo noting that "wholesale
trade is rather quieter."
Dun's fferiem reports that "new business
in primary markets is still largely
deferred, as usual at thin season, but
there are indications of reviving demand
In certain channels where dullness
has lately prevailed. Resumption
of buying In dome Instances lias been
prompted by lower prices, yet many
poller* are eo well engaged ahead that
concessions are by no means the rule."
