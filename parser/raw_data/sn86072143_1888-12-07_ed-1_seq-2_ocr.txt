Washington, Dec. 0. In transmitting
I i- message to Congress President Cleveland
II attention to Hie tact, that with tins
r. -uit session of Congress ends tlio first
mury of' our oontitutional existence und
ri his retrospective says; Tho gulf between
-hi .loyors 'mnl tlio oniploytnl is constantly
v i li-nltiR, ami classes are rapidly Icrming,
en- comprising tho very rich ami powerful,
v do in another are iound the toiling poor.
As we view the achievements of aggregated
capital, we discover the exigence of trusts,
combinations und monopolies, while the eiti
zm is struggling far in tho rear or is
trampled to death beneath an iron heel.
Corporations, which should be tho carefully
restrained creatures of tho law and
the servants of the people, nro
fast becoming tho peoples' masters.
Whilo congratulating ourselves upon tho
wealth nnd pro-perky of our country and
complacently contemplating every incident of
change, inseparable Irom these conditions,
it U our duty us patriotic citizens to Inquire
nt the present stage of our progress how tho
bond of the government, made with the peo
ple, has been kept and performed. instead
of limiting the tribute drawn from our cit
izens, to the necessities of economical admin
istration, the government persists in exact
ing from tho substance of the people millions
svhiob, unapplied and useless, lie dormant in
its treasury. The flagrant injustice and
this breach of faith and obligation add to ex
tortion the danger attending the diversion
of the currency of tho country from tho le
gitimate channels of Inr-iuc-'.
TIIK TARIFF AND THfi SURPLUS.
The messago proceeds: Itender the same
Jaws by which these results are pioduced,
tho government permits many millions more
to bo added to tho cost of the living of our
people, and to bo taken iiom our consumers,
which unreasonably swell tho profits of a
email, but powerful, minority, tho people
must still bo taxed for the support of the
government, under tho operation of tariff
law s, and to tho extent that the mass of our
citizens are inordinately burdened beyond
any useful public purpose, and for the bene
fit of a favored few. The government, un
der pretext of an exercise of its taxing pow
ers.enters gratuitously into partnership with
these favorites to their advantage nnd to the
injury of u Mist majoi ity of our people.
This is not equality before the law.
Till: KX1ST1NG MTUATION
is injurious to tho health of our entire
body politic. It stillcs, in those for whose
lenefit it is permitted, all patriotic lovo of
country, and substitutes in its place, selfish
preed and grasping avarice. Devotion to
American citizenship for its own sake and
for what it should accomplish as a motive
t) our nation's advancement and the happi-iv-
of nil our people, is displaced by thp
a- -umptinn that tlio government, instead of
b. me. the embodiment of equality, is but
e i instrumentality, through which especial
i i I individual advantages aro to bo gained.
' i ievuiices of those not included within
l in ie of these beneficiaries, when tully
. d, will surely arouse irritation and
mailt. Our farmers, long-sufferui
..uionl, will not fail to see, in spite of
. I'lesentations and misleading fallacies,
they aiv obliged to accept
i prices lor their pi outlets as are
I in foreign markets, vvheru they
! 1'j with the farmers of the world.
. lneir kinds are declining in value while
ii di bts increase; and that without cont-
,-. . :ui ; favor they are forced by the tie
, i . i i the government to pay for tho bene
. others such enhanced prices lor the
i i ,s they need, that the . auty returns of
h labor lad to furnish iheir support or
, ,' no margin for n mutilation. Our
. 1 1 kinsmen, no longer deluded by theory
it l.iWi r wages, will demaud. through such re-
m- iii, steadier employment, cheaper neees
tu . freedom tor themselves und children
1i 'othe doom of perpetual servitude and
. e u mi door to their advancement beyond
ii .mils of a laboring class, citizens of mod
' . rule salaries and llxwl incomes will also iu-
ist upon cheapening the cost of necessities.
AVti'-n to the selfishness of the beneficiarie
of unjust discrimination is added the discon
tent of those who stiller wo shall realize that
tin- beneficent purpose of our government is
endangered. Communism is a hateful thing
nnd a menace to peace and oiganized go
eminent, but the communism of combined
wealth, and capital, the outgrowth of over
wcning cupidity und selfishness, which in
siduously undermines the justice and integ
rity of tree institutions, is not less danger
oils than the communism of oppressed pov
erty which, exasperated by injustice nnd dis
content, attack -i with wild diorder the citi
del of rule. He inoeks the jiuople, who pro
poses that the government shall protect the
rich, nnrl that tliey, in turn, will care for
tlio Mooring poor.
A jus; nnd sensible revision of our tariir
Jaws should bo made, for tho relief of those
ot our countrymen who suffer under present
conditions, nucn a revision should receive
the support of nil who huve that justice and
equality due to Americun citizenship: of ull
who realize that in this justice and equality
our government finds its strength nnd its
power to protect the citizen and his property
of nil who believe that the c on tented compe
tence nnd comfort of many accord better
with tho spuit of our institutions than co
lossnl fortunes unfairly gathered ill the
liands of a few who appieciate that the for
1 earance and fraternity among our neonle,
which recognize the value of every Ameri
can interest, are the surest guaranty of our
national progress; and of all who desire to
tee the products of American skill and in
genuity in every market of tho world withn
resulting restoration of American com
merce. WEED OF REVKNUE REDUCTION".
The necessity for revenue reduction is
gone-rally conceded but the means und ben
efit to result present an important contro
versy. No apparent removal only of tho
burden of taxation should be tolerated,
neither extravagant appropriations. Exist
ing evils and injustico should bo honestly
recognized, boldlyf met and effectively reme
died. There should bo no cessation of tho
struggle until a plan is effected, fair and
conservative, tow aids existing industries, re
ducing tho cost of necessaries, providing
free raw materials and permitting no injury
o labor. It is the people's cause and should
never bo compromised. Selfish protected
interests nro intimatoby connected with the
hugely prevailing sentiment that the gov
ernment is tho fountain of individual and
private uid and should relievo upon tho
H.ightt pietcxt the distress of citizens und
communities. Thero is also n growing us--uinption
against the government in favor
of private claims and the waiving of busi
ness rules in dealing with such. Tho wealth
of the government and t lie poverty of the
citizen dealing with it is getting to bo a iuf-
Ilcleut rcuson lor breaking contracts
with tho government, lirosooutiniT claims
nanliisb if, falling lo produce evidence for
mo government, thu m-antlm: ot pen ons
and expending largo sums lor public build
ings nnd other improvements, thereby
crowding out notion on iniportunt matters.
As an Instance of thl-i crowding, relief has
been refused the overcrowded docket of tlio
Supreme Court to the distress of suitors and
the denial of justice, while many laws have
passed providing tor holding inferior courts
to suit localities or lay the foundation for
the erection of u new public building. A
bill to prevent spoliation of nubile! lands has
been neglected, while many private or State
lalms und applications for public kinds have
been allowed, A well-endorsed plun for In
dian reform has failed of legislative sanction,
wniio douhttul grants to railroads to pass
through Indian reservations have multiplied.
Tho undisputed necessity lor prisons for
I nited Stales convicts and a postolllco ut
tho national capital has been ignored, while
scores of less necessary public buildings have
been erected. An easily effected and just
revision ot our pension laws hns been post
poned, while hundreds of private pension
laws tiro annually passed, which arc the
source of unjust discrimination und popular
demoralization
ArrnorutATio.NS.
Appropriation bills for the support of tho
government are defaced by items und pro
visions to meet private ends, nnd it. is free-
asserted by responsible and experienced
parties, that a bill appropriating money for
public internal improvements would fail to
meet with favor unless it contained items,
more fur local and private advantage than
for public benefit. Devotion lo tho public
good, the president says, will lead us to
strongly resist all iinpntieneo of constitu
tional limitations of federal power, und to
persistently check the increasing tendency
to extend the scope of federal legislation
into the domain of Stat and local jurisdic
tion upon the plen of subserving the public
welfare. The preservation of the partition--
between proper subjects of lederal and local
care and regulation, is of such importance
under tho constitution, which is the law of
our very existence, that no considcrutiem
of expediency or sentiment should
tempt us to enter on doubtful grounds.
The. president here quotes from President
Jackson to the effect that ho desires also to
restoio unimpaired tho sacred trust confided
to his charge and persuade his countrymen
that it is not in u splendid government sup
ported by powerful monopolies and aristo
cratic establishments thatthey will find hap
piness and liberty but in a plain system
protecting all and favoring none. Such a
overnment only will preservo unity, pros
perity and freedom. He then continues:
OUIt KORE1UN RELATIONS.
T have the satisfaction to nnnounce that
the end of the year finds tho country at
peaco withinmul without. During the year
our loieign relations havo lieen improved
by mutual good olllees, treaties and
reciprocal extradition of criminals. J he
question bet ween Great Britain and the
Ijnitcd States relating to the rights of
American fishermen, under treaty and inter
national comity, in the teiritorial waters of
Canada and Newfoundland, I regret, to say,
aro not yet satisfactorily adjusted. The pres-
identsays this matter was fully treated in his
message of Februrury last and the proceed
ings in connection therewith hav e been trans
mitted, for the approval of the Senate. Com
ment upon or repetition of thim ho considers
unnecessary at this time. Consequently he
ho simply renews the statement of Septem
ber i2 laLt, that 'Sine-o March .1, J8S7, no
ease has been reported to the department of
state wherein complaint has been made of
unfriendly or unlawful treatment of Amor
icon fishing vessels on the part of the Cana
dian authorities', in which reparation vvu
not promptly and satisfactorily obtained by
tin- united States consul general at Hull
fax,"
Till! FISHERY M.sPUTE.
The president here refers to his effort to
settle by treaty the long-standing fishery
dispute, asserts that he believes the rejected
treaty did furnish n satisfactory, final and
practical adjustment upon an honorable
basis, nllndes to his unavailing recommend
ation of other legislation to settle the dilli-
eulty und again invokes the earnest and
immediate attention o Congress to the
matter for the settlement of which ho is
deeply solicitous.
TUB SACKVIM.E EPISODE.
Regarding the Snckville-AVcst episode the
president promises to lay the e'orrespoiidencn
before Congroi-.-, which, he says, will show
the unpardonable conduct of Lord Saekville
in interfering with the suffrages of Amen
can citizens in the very crisis of tho presi
dential election, and his subsequent public
declaration to justify his action, impugning
the executive and Senate in important
questions now pending between the two
governments1. Tho president calls tho
oll'enso most grave, involving disastrous pos
sibilities. Full opportunity was nlforded her
majesty's government to relieve the situation
1 considered prolongation of the discussion
to be unwarranted and thereupon rleclined
to turther recognize thu diplomatic char
acter ot tlio person wiioso conlinunnco in
such functions would destroy that mutual
e'onlldence which is essential to the good un
derstanding of tho two governments and
was inconsistent with the welfare and self
respect of tho government of tho United
States. The usual interchange of communi
cation has since continued through, her
mujesty's legation in this city.
the r.nr.AT j-akeb.
It ismuchto be desired, says thopresielent,
thatsouio agreement should be reached with
her majesty 'b government, by which tho dam
ago to life and property on tho grent lakes
may bo alleviated by removing or humanely
regulating the obstacles to reciprocate as
sistanco to wrecked or stranded vessels.
OTHEll INTERESTS AND RELATIONS.
Referring to compulsory servico of Amer-
can citizens of French origin on their return
to tho land of their birth, tho president sees
no oce-nsion to leccde from the position it
has maintained nnd considers it applicable
to all countries with which no special treaties
have ben concluded. He renews his recom
meudations for the passage of a bill refund
ing tho interest on tonnago dues illegally
exacted from certain lierman stevunshii
lines. Regarding our Interests in Samoa he
stutes further correspondence nnd history of
ovents since April 1" will lie laid before the
Houso of Representatives in due course of
time. Calling attention to the indemnity
awarded Chinese subjects for Injuries Miller
od at the hands of lawless men, he state
tho fund await reception by tho Chinese
govcrnmeut and hopes by the cessation of
tlie Inllux or this class or l lilnese subjects,
thnt the cause of unkindly feelings has been
removed.
It is homsl that improvements may bo
soon secured in tho jurisdictional system
respecting foreigners in Japan and relief af
lorded that country regarding oppressiv
foreign control in commercial matters. He
lee-ommends that relief be provided for Jap
uuese subjects In the island of Ikisma who
snlfeivd injury lrom United htntes naval
target practice. Diplomatic Intercourse has
been establlsh'il with Comi and legislative
provision is asked to organize and equip con
sular courts in the country. Persia having
established diplomatic reprcs 'illation in this
eapltnl.it ishope-l commercial lclatltuisvvlll be
brought about lwlwccn the two countries.
The president deplores the state of affairs In
llaytl and has instructed tho United States
minister to nbtuin front interference be
tween the waning factions, but to protect
American property and citizens.
JleasurcH have been adopted to prevent
and redress any molestation regarding seiz
ures of vessels under the American Hag.
Relations of special nnd benelicent inter
course have been created with Hawaii under
the treaty of June !!, J 75. He recommends
snbmaiino communication with Honolulu,
the geographical position of which creates u
natural dependency and mutuality of
interests.
MEXICO AND SOOTH ME11K1A.
An appropriation Is recommended to ro-
locato the line between the United Stntesuiid
Mexico and the president adverts with satls-
iction to the gooel feuling existing betevven
the two countries, lie congratulates Brazil
on abolishing the tho last vestigo of slavery.
Tho claims of our citizens against Chill will
bo urged upon that government nnd It is
hopetl will not b further delayed. It is
hoped mutual prosperity and good under-
tanding will bo promoted vvitli Peru by the
treaty of November last. The claim of San-
tor, an American citizen, against Lcuador
will be submitted to tho Senate for approval;
also the claims of Carlos liutterfleld against
Denmark and Vnn Bokden ngninst Hnvti
will probably bo disposed of in the same
manner. Further extension of the rehear
ing of claims of American citizens against
Venezuela awaits the consent of the Senate:
nnd it is hoped confirmation of the supple
mentary action will bo prompt, thus averting
legislative or other action to prevent tho
withholding of such rights of uctual claim
nuts us may be shown to exist. Preliminary
teps have been taken for the assemblage at
this capital of the representatives of South
and Central American States, Hayti and
San Domingo to discuss monetary and com
mercial toiilcs, except where contiguity of
territory nnd a common border line, inca
pable of being guarded, reciprocal commer
cial treaties may bo foun expedient. It isbo-
lieveel that commercial policies inducing freer
mutual exchange of products can be most
advantageously arranged by independent, but
co-operative legislation. Tlio maritime pro
mises confer m Washington next April to
devise uniform niles nnd measures for great
er security of lifo and property at sea, lrom
which important results aro confidently an
ticipated. TONNAGE DUTIES.
The ISS-l oet and amendments thereto
in relation to tonnage unties havo caused
wide divergence of opinion between us nnd
ither nations nnd will be niaelo tho subject
of a special message.
NATURALIZATION AND rASSrOUTS.
A careful revision of naturaliatution
laws is recommended to prevent well-known
ihuscs resulting from increased immigration,
ind international I'oniplii'utions likely to
nriso therefrom. A central bin can for the
registration of passports is again strongly
lwoiumcudcd, to prevent spurious citizen-
hip and avoid unjust responsibility.
THE CONSULAR. SERVICE.
A re-orgauizntion of our consular service,
a reduction of tlio number of the ollie&s is
advised with aelequato compensation attaeh-
1 to those retained : also a recasting of
the appropriations for tho maintenance of
our e-onsular- service, forbideling fees, in
stituting a system of consular inspection and
authorizing secretaries of legation at large, j
CENTENNIAL OF WASHINGTON'S INAUGURA
TION.
The president recommends fitting nnd co
operate o action by Congress on liehulf of
the people of the United States for the cen
tennial celebration on April III), 1S80, of the
inauguration of Oeorge Washington us presi
dent of the United Stutes.
DEPARTMENT REPORTS,.
Tlie president then referred to tho reports
of the fevcrnl departments which have al
ready been made public. He concurs in the
lvi'ommendntion ot the secretary of the
treasury that tho further e-oinage of silver
be suspended, and asks the careful attention
to other recommenrlatious made in tlie secie
tary's report. The president also approves
of all the re'commendatioiis made by tho
secretary of war in his annual report and
takes oe-casion to pay a warm tribute to the
memory of the Into Ren. Sheridan, Presi
dent Cleveland expresses himself us not nt
all in sympathy with these "benevolent, but
injudicious people who are constantly insist
ing that the Apaeiie Indians should be re
turned to their reservation." Their removal,
he says, was an absolute necessity, It is a
mistaken philiinthrophy, every way injuri
ous, which prompts tho elesiro to see the
avages rcturded to their old homes.
THE NAVY,
The report of tho becietary of tho nnvy,
he says, demonstrates very intelligent man
agement in that important department, and
discloses tlie most satisfactory progress in
the work of reconstructing the navy made
during tho past year.
VARIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS.
The president approves the bill intro
duced at the last session of Congress by
which a uniform standard in tho amount
of gross ree-eipts would fix theright of
community to a public building to be
erected by tho government lor postolllco
purposes. Tho president refers to the suc
cess of tho government suits against the Per
jietual Emigration Fund company and
church of Jesus Christ of latter elay saints
by which their charters were forfeited mid
more than $M)0,0ul) worth of property placed
in the hands of a receiver,
THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
Referring to the report of the secretary
of tho interior tho president em
phasizes the importance of insuring a right
elisposition of public lands and avoidance, of
the iniquities of luneled proprietorship. Ho
says wo havo no excuse for the violation of
principles cogently taught by reason nnd
example. He proudly retrospects the work
done the past your toward restoringthe pub
lic domain for tho use of uctual settlers, over
M),OuU,000 acres having been wrested from
illegnl usurpation. He hope-s that not even
the desert lands will lie allowed to fall into
hands of monopolies, but will, with these
sources of irrigation, be preserved for Iho
people's benefit. He recommends appro
priate measures to complete the adjustment
of tho various grants made to the States for
internal improvements ns well as to adjudi
cate and determino the vulidity and extent
of private land claims.
THE INDIAN l'ROHLBM.
He says tho Indian situation is steadily
improving and civilizing education rapidly
taking tho lilaco or barbarism. Allotment
in severalty nro being rapidly made, justice
and fairness rather than rapid elispatch be
ing ainusl nt. Everything is to be hoped
for Horn tho system and so soem as allot
incuts aro completed remaining lands should
lie opened to settlers, The president thinks
thnt the facilities for education urged by tho
secretury promise most amelioration to the
Indian. 'When these are in operation and
availed of the cm se v ill be lilted, tho In
dian savt'd and the sin of his oppressed re
deemed. THE RAtbltOATlR.
An early adjustment of tho relations be.
tweon thu government and the railroads
which have received laud grants, is urged,
anil should bo dealt with solely as a business
proposition, with a view to a final realiza
tion of its indohleilnos'i by the government,
rather than as n question to bo decided
upon prejudice! or by way of punishment tor
previous wrung doing.
Tho message concludes : The conscious
ness that I have presented but an imperfect
statement of the condlllon of our country,
nnd its wants occasions no fear that, any
thing omitted Is not known and appreciated
by the Congress, upon whom rests the
responsibility of Intelligent legislation on
behalf of a great nation, and of conlldln

In speaking ot the long and short haul the
report says : In Hies section of tho country
north of the Potomac mid east of the Mis
souri in which greater charges, were made
for short transportation, thu lircuinstaiices
are such that complaint is not often made
that they operate oppressively. Tho report
snys ocean competition is still recognized by
the roads to some extent ns controlling tlie
through rates upon overland tralllc
and is relied upon ns a justification
for sonifiwhal higher rate's to points this
side of tho Pacific coast terminals than nro
mado to points situated directly on the
Paclllc coast. It is claimed lroight is taken

favorable conditions.
In the Southern Slates tlie carriers move

The report takes up the subject of the

ed it had a damaging I'fl'ect the com

the report says : The eirect of the decisions
of the commission has bes'ii toward an im

Tho wars hail their origin in suspicions on
tlie part of earners, respectively,
that their competitors were not
observing the e,icii public rates.
Tho effort of the commission to obtain lrom
the parties evidimee of tho practices they siw
pected havo been wholly ineffectual. The
legal rights of carriers to rceluce the general
rates to airy extent is unquestionable. The
law does not as-umo that arailroad company

made unreasonably low and it has not con
ferred upon tho commission the power to

ing this uttorani'c tho speaker said Hint this
parable deals with tho political economy of
Cod, yet strange to say it is nlmost entire
ly ignored in the political economy of men.
This principle has never been incorporate-el
into the politienl social system vvliieii regu
lates our lives.. Our .social being is organ
ized about the idea of sell-seeking.
There are two gi eat schools of political
I'cononiy. the fii-st of which is the laiwz
ki'i: or let alone system. It insists that
state and society should have the least re
straint possible. We of America probably
nave the gi cutest hPerty m the world,
speaker then ret. ried to the erroneous
,'he j
idea i
of those who Mock to this country from
ubroed, under Hie belief Hint they will here
llml themselves free from nil restraint.
Opposed to the school referred lo is the
principle of communism, which should not,
however, he confounded with anarchy. The
conlliets waging in the social and industrial
weuid are only those between individualism
and socialism. Tlie principles of Christ
never come in to arbitrate but majestically
assert themselves. Christian priuciple doe.s
not endorse even the doctrine in the declar
ation of independence, that nil men are
created equal. The current political econo
my says a man's possessions are for his own
enjoyment first. Christ's political economy
says that a man's possessions nro primarily
inr the good uso which be can iniiko of
them in helping ethers. The speaker pro
ceeded to illustrate his statcmnt in the con-
ditioits of the typical manufacturing village
and an imaginary condition of social uf-
fairs.
AVe miit bear tlio burden of life not only
for ourself, but for others. "Whnt matters
it if a ninn leaves his wealth for the public
welfare after ho is through with it, so
long as he did not give himself to others.
AVc ncssl the tonic of wholesome leal
ism of Christianity and sin. Men of an
tagonistic principle and belief unitetl to
put the Messiah to death. They believed in
u McRsinh, but when Ho came, when the ab
stract became concrete, they revolted and
suiel Hioy would not accept Him us the
Messiah. The test now an of old is that he
who hearelli His voice is of Him. Men
now as never before, realize that tho princi
ples of Christ are to be tried and not specu
lated about. "He that hath an ear Ietliim
hour what the spirit saith unto the
churches. "
Tliir- abstract doe.s but scant justice to a
very striking, original and able discourse.
The services closed with tho benediction
by Rev. Mr. Mcl'mian.
SERVICES AT THE UNITARIAN CIU'RCH.
The Thanksgiving elay servico at the Uni
tarian church was u Sunday school exercise.
The pastor. Rev. Mr. Ware, liiudo a brief
and appropriate address to the children of
the Sunday school. He told how our
pleasant New Knghind festival came to be
eslablisheel. and spoke of tho hardships of
the early pilgrims, ile said that ho liked
the day moio ami luoiv, and would us soon
give up Christmas or Daster ns Thanksgiv
ing. Mr. Ware then told in a manner es
pecially attractive to tho children of a
Thanksgiving dinner which ho oueo nto
among tlie ruins ot Peupoii. Referring to
the disti ibution of good things, which was
to be made to Hie neisly after tho close of
tho service, Mr. Ware said : "1 bid you
(iod-speesl in your good work. May you all
muember that it is moro bk'ssed to give
than to receive. (Jive thanks to the Father
in Heaven to-day with all your hearts, und
give of your abundance to tlio-o who have
not so tuu'ii. In kindness-giving is true
thu nksgiviug."
At the close of the servico tenuis wero elo
putched to oil points of tho city with bas
kets of the substuntiuls which go to
to make up a proper Thanksgiving
dinner, Hie good things having been brought
by the niembiTs of the Sunday school from
their lioiues. Iu this way Thanksgiving day
whs nuide n day of joy to many a needy

AT ST. PAUL'S CHURCH.
Interesting services wero held nt St.
Paul's church Thursday. The opening ser
vices weie conducted by the rector, Rev. Dr.
J. lsliuni liliss, assisted by Rev, T. A. Hop
kins. Dr. Bliss preached very ably from
the words found in tho first epistle general
of John iv 11) ; "Wo love, him because he
first loved us.
Among other things the speaker said :
"The natural prislisposititm of mankind is to
love one who loves, as love naturally U'jets
love. A person w ho Is not InUueneed by
afTiM'tion bestowed upon him is considered
almost u monster. The one evnt principls
in Hod's dealing with men is his intiiso af
fection. The speaker then briefly mentioned
a tew of the numerous ways in which that
love is ninnifestisl. The love for our race
culminated when (toil sent his son into the
win Id, for the redemption not of the good
but of those living in a constant state of dis
obiilienoe. On tho pages of the history of each one of
us may be found Instances of Hod's love in
all the lienotits which wo aro wont to ascribe
to sisondary sources. liven those who
si-em to bo most grievously atllicti'd must
remember that whom the lird loyeth ho
chasteneth. Our lovo i duo him lns-niiso
ho first loved us. The affection manifested
by ninny is but n sentimental or superficial
love, but Clod has given us a standard, if ye
lovo mo kccp my commandments,
Tho offering of the day was for tho needy

there; while one impulsive citieii is will
ing "to bet my head that iu five years fiom
now then; will not be any State nulitm or a
permanent camp ground. One or the other
will go. The people of Kssex Junction w ill
