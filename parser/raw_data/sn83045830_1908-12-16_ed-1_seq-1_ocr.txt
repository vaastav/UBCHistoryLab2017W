of the captured ship.
The crew of the "23 De Mayo'' made
no resistance.
Formerly American Vessel.
All the rifles found on boar.l wer?
sent ashore with the crew. The "23:
De .Mayo" was formerly an American
steamer, called the Alliance.
She belonged to a Mr. SuiHh, who
?was at one time American consul
here. She was captured by Vene?
zuela in 1897 while in distress off
Maracaibo. on the ground that she
was engaged in running contraband
to the Venezuelan coast.

Venezuelan government, and his de?
mand was reduced in 1903 to $2,'.?)".
After Torpedo Boat.
The Du:ch cruiser Relderland left
here yesterday for the Venezuelan

The "2.1 De Mayo'- while classed as
a coast guard vessel is a unite of
the Venezuelan navy, but her size and]
strength are insignificant. She is of
139 tons and is armed with one ma?
chine gun.

the resolution which In its original
form simply called for hi formation
from I he secretary of state regarding
what the British House of Commons
