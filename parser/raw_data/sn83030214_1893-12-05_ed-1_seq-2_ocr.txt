by a notoriously self-afcertlve and overbearing
Executive.
President Cleveland's treatment of the Ha?
waiian question is, on Its face, an avowed dec?
laration of contempt for the wishes and opin?
ions of tho Senate, ti.,., i-ordtnste tresty-msklng

the bold announcement is made thal it has
seemed to the Administration that "the only

This is Pimply a restatement affirmatively of
the question pul by Secretary Gresham In liis
memorandum to Ihe President, published four
weeks ago, and throws no more real Unlit on
the tortuous processes by which the Adminis?
tration has evolved tbe p iwer t.? mske war up ti
a friendly recognised fovernment and overturn
Its legitimate authority to restore deposed
Queen than did Ih.- Quixotic argument of Gen
cral Gresham's astonishing bri. f. "With a view
of accomplishing this result within the constl
tutlonal limits of Executive power," continues
the Pre-iii-nt. "and recognising all our obliga?
tion! and responsibilities growing mn of changed
conditions brought about hy our unjustifiable
Interference, our present Minister has received
appropriate Instructions lo that end." As in.
information of the success of his efforts to re?
store the Queen has come, Congress is practi?
cally told to dismiss all thought of th,.. Ha?
waiian question until tho expected nows arrives
and it ls no longer within tho power ..f the li _?
Islative branch to negative or modify th A 1
ministration's unpopular and un-American pro?
gramme. A Special message will bo Sell! to
Congress, the President calmly suggests when
the Queen's difficulties hive ail been solved.
Meanwhile Congress and the country can either
stop guessing at what is going on in Hawaii or
guess again.
That so decided an Indorsement "f Secretary
Greshanfs prejudiced and discredited policy
should have boen ventured upi.n in Un- annual
message naturally excited tho Indignation of
the many Democrats in Congress who still clung
ti sound American traditions in the c induct
Of foreign affairs, and few could 1-- found in
either branch who would go tho length of de?
fending either the matter or the manner of the
brief paragraphs which contained all that the
Admlnistraiion cared to say in defence of its
proposed violation of Hawaiian sovereignty.
Democrats in the House were equally reticent,
as a rule, in defending. Mr. Cleveland's ant li i
patory approval of clauses of tho Wilson bill
which have as yet no actual or official existence.
The members of the Ways and Means Com?
mittee, according to their own stetements hsd
not yet agreed upon the revenue <>r income
tax portions of the Wilson bill when the mes?
sage reached Oro H^uso. and they wen- natu?
rally shocked to" find tin* Executive approving
beforehand work which the committee had not
done or might not do.
THE PRKSIt-KNTS VNTKNAnLF. POslTl >N
Complaint enough was made in the House
last August that the Administration was as?
suming all the functions of the legislative
branch in the passage of the Wilson Silver
Purchase bill. The President had then only
recommended a general lino of leglslstlon, but
now, to the surprise of Democrats in Congress,
he was actually arranging in advance tlc- de?
tails of a complicated revenue bill. No Presi?
dent heretofore, lt ls safe to say, has ever put
himself In such an untenable position as ap?
proving Items in a complex measure which, to
the public knowledge, has not yet seen tho light
even of a Congressional committee room.
An unpleasant significance was also attached
by many Democratic leaders to the President's
plain intimation that no further financial legis?
lation ls desirable from this Congress. "Hens.di?
able delay," he says, "inste.il of being injurious
^ will Increase the probability of wis- action."
^ This recommendation is of course highly uti
JB palatable to tho chairman of the Finance Com
W mittee of the Senate and his follow Democrats,
who for three months insisted that the repeal of
the purchase clause of tho Sherman act was
but a first step forward in a groat programme
of financial legislation which would include as
its chief features the renewed uso of Sliver and
the abolition of the 10 per cent tax "ti Btate
bank issues. But the Voorhees programme, as
the free silver Democrats predicted, if the Presi?
dent's hint ls to be taken at fe ?? value, ls likely
to prove for the rest of this Congress au "iri?
descent dream."
?OMI OPINIONS OK TIIK. MESSAGE.
Some opinions on the message from public
men of both parties follow:
Mr. Wilson (Dem., W. Vs.), chairman of thi
Ways and Means Committee I consider it s verjt
fair and business-like review of ail the public ques?
tions on which the President i- celled upon to ad?
dress the people of the country. I am es] ? lally
pleased at what he says on the tariff question.
Mr. MeCresry <l'<-m., Ky.), chairman of the
House Committee on Foreign Affalis An able and
appropriate message. Jt contains much valuable
Information. He presents foreitsn affairs, tho mone?
tary question and the tariff with great ability. I
regard the message as one of th<* strongest he
has ever sent the House of Representatives. Ills
utterances on the Hawaiian question are I
full as Bone persons expected, but I have confl
dence In his Judgment and ability, and hope for a
satisfactory adjustment of the Hawaiian affairs.
Mr. Dalzell (Rep., Fenn.)?The President's views
on the tariff seem to be on the lin- heretofore laid
down by him. Ile thinks a protective tariff in?
variably incr-.is.s the cost to thc consumer. We
know that such is not the case under Ihe opera
Hons of th" McKinley law, a fact that would have
been apparent to the Pl sch nt if he had Been nt
to read the testimony taken before tba Way* and
Means Committee, of course, as was to be ex
' pected, he ls still after the markets of the world
a very desirable thing if present Conditions con?
tinue, besssse there won't be any market at home
or any money to spend in it. The most astonish
lng thing in the mesasge is that an Income las
has been agni il upon. That's new** I happen to
be a member ol the minority of the Ways and
Means Committee, but lt ls the tirst time I knew
such a tax had been agreed upon, although 1 have
inquired diligently :il>>ut lt every day.
Mr. Rynum (Dem., Indi lt is p very concise bul
clear statement of the multitude of questions which
Congress will bs called on to consider. I am ??
pecially pleased with the section referring to the
tariff, and the courageous manner In which tic
President comes to the support of the Wsys and
Means Committee.
Mr. Sprinter iliem., 111.)?The message i s con
else and able exposition of the present condition
of l-he country, fm the Important subjects of the
tariff snd our relations with Hawaii tbe message
speaks in no mistakable Isnguage. On the in.ii
he wisely recommends adherence to our party
pledges and the early passage of a tariff Mil which
shall embody thc reforms demanded hy the Ameri?
can people. I regret that a more definite recom
tnendatlon In reference to our curri ney was nol
made. In reference to Hawaii, the PreaMenl states
in concise terms the true position for our Govern*
ment to pursue, namely, the restoration of Ike
condition which existed before the armed inter?
vention of the l~ntted States.
Mr. Maguire (Dem., Cal.), one of the loading
lights In the House from the Pacific coast?I re
gard lt as an unusually good state paper. The
treatment of the Chinese question ls fully satis?
factory. The treatment of the Hawaiian question
is not ss full as we would like to have lt, but thc
Suggestion that there will be a special message Ol
