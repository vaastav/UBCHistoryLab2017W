Washington, Dec. 4.—The annual re
port of the secretary of the treasury
was sent to congress today. It is a vol
uminous document. The report deals
largely in statistics, the recent bond is
sue and makes recommendations which,
in the opinion of the secretary, will im
prove the financial system of the gov
ernment. He calls attention to the in
ability of the secretary, under existing
laws, to make adequate provision for
support of the public credit. He says
the well-known defects in our financial
system, and the serious evils threat
ened, have done more than all other
things to check the industrial and com
mercial progress of the country. The
secretary says:
"The only part of the currency pos
sessing in any degree a quality of elas
ticity is that issued by the national
banking associations, and it is now gen
erally conceded that it has failed to
meet the requirements of the situation
at some of the most critical periods in
the business affairs of the country. Its
failure is credible, in my opinion, to
three principal causes: First, to the
large volume of United States currency
of various kinds kept constantly out
standing, making the contraction or
expansion of the comparatively small
national batik circulation less effective
than it would otherwise have been;
second, the difficulty and delay in pro
ducing. and, to some extent, in retiring
the circulation; thirdly, and mainly, the
provisions of the law which require the
deposit of United States bonds to secure
circulation and restrict the issue in
notes to 90 per cent, of the par value of
the bonds.

"In addition to existing obstructions j
to the prompt increase and decrease of ,
circulation, the 9th section of the act of
July, 1882. which provides for tlie ext

tional banks, expressly prohibits them i tax

IS A GOLD BUG.
Tlie secretary further says; "So lung
as there are in circulation under au
f the government two coins
thority
unequal In value hut equal in legal ten
der qualities, every consideration of
good faith and sound policy requires
a prompt redemption of the notes on
presentation in the kind of coin de
manded by the holder and the constant
advance of such administrative meth
ods us may be necessary to preserve the
purchasing power of the less valuable
metal. This is essential to the continued
circulation of our standard silver dol
lars and their paper representatives at
par and to abandon this policy without
substituting a better one would not
only fail to cure any of the evils now
existing but would entail additional
and greater ones.
"This situation Is the direct result
of our currency legislation and It can
not be permanently avoided or even
temporarily improved without material
changes in our laws relntlng to that
subject. These features are: First,
circulation of United States notes as
c urrency and their current redemption
In coin on demand.; second, compul
sory re-lssue of such notes after re
demption; third, excessive accumula
tion and coinage of silver and the Issue
of notes and certificates against it upon
a ratio which greatly over values the
amount as compared with the standard
unit of value in this and other princi
pal countries.
"Frequent Issues of bonds for the pur
pose of procuring gold, which can not
be kept after it has been obtained, will
certainly cause Increased distrust
among our own people as well as among
the people of other countries and not
only «well the volume of our securities
returned from abroad, for sale or re
demption. but increase the withdrawal
of foreign capital here, before invested
in domestic enterprises. We
preserve our trade relations with the
best customer» for our surplus products
unless we maintain a monetary sys
tem substantially in accord with theirs,
and until they manifest a disposition
to co-operate with the United States In
effecting a change upon terms Just and
fair to all our interests we ought to
continue our adhesion to the gold
standard of value with as large a use
of silver as is consistent with strict
maintenance of that policy.
"Since the resumption of specie pay
ments United States legal tender und
treasury notes have been redeemed In
gold to the amount of $60.000.000 and all
notes redeemed have been reissued and
are now' outsanding. They are a con

will say:
"The portion of President Cleveland's
message which will command the first

interests of the country is that relating
to currency, with which the message
concludes. The message is a practical

for the great amount of useful Informa

Mr. Patterson of Tennessee, dwelt at
length on the oppressiveness of illegal
iatc-eutting for the benefit of a packing
company at Chicago. That combine, he
said, handled in dollars more beef than
the entire cotton crop of the United
States amounted to. The rates made
for this corporation practically drove
small competitors from the field, and
fixed the price of every bullock on every
farm in the south and west. Under the
present law. he said, It was impossible
to Hecure conviction for violation of the
anti-pooling section, because both par
ties to the cut rate w'ere equally guilty
before the law, and one could not be
made to testify against the other. The
pending bill would compel testimony
and did not aim at the punishment of
the clerk or agent, but of the railw'ay
company itself. Mr, Cannon did not
think the administrative functions and
responsibilities shauld be shouldered on
to tho courts, but that revoking of the
pooling arrangements should be within
control of the commission.

remarks the house adjourned.

Japanese students by Chinese authori

protection of the United States. Sen

Senator Chandler suggested as the
senator from Alabama (Morgan) was
chairman of the foreign relations com

saw any objection to securing speedy
Information. Senator Morgan stated
that war was n*»w progressing between
China and Japan and it would be unwise
to take any action which would appear
favorable to one of the belligerents or
the other. Senator Morgan said ids
main objection to the resolution was
that it was a predicate to impeachment
of the president or secretary of state.
