Cleveland’s First Message.
The first annual message of President ,
Cleveland was presented to Congress at j
noon on Tuesday, and we lay it before our (
readers this morning in a supplement. i
It was the first annual message from a *
Democratic President for twenty-five years, s
and its coming was awaited with great in- (
--Merest hy men of all parties and by men of ,
r no party. For the first time in many years, *
too, the message was attentively listened to f
by Senators and Representatives, nearly all .
of whom remained in their seats during the ]
two hours occupied in its reading. Here- |
toforc the reading of a President’s message j
was a mere formality, and few members of ■
cither house remained until it was finished. .
The change in party supremacy created an
, interest in the first official promulgation of
governmental policy, and the message was
eagerly awaited and attentively listened to. j
. President Cleveland has the faculty of j
expressing himself clearly and strongly in j
f graceful English. 11 is message is compre
hensive, Vnd shows a complete mastery of
all the details of government, while his
vifcws on all subjects arc plain and straight
forward. There is no shrinking from deal
ing with ((uestions of paramount importance
and upon which men differ. All are
treated with a frankness born of conscien
tious! convictions, and are handled in a
manntr that is convincing.
X Jmy half of the message is taken up
with foreign affairs, and the details of our
j % diplomatic intercourse with other govern-
I monts are sot forth minutely. Besides the
* information given, which should bo closely
read hy everybody, the President reiterates
the doctrine of non-intervention with the
affairs of other governments, opposes the !
acquisition of new and distant territory, or
\ the incorporation of remote interests with
our own.
The three chief subjects of our internal
a flairs —Finance, Tariff and Civil Service-
Reform—are boldly met and convincingly
treated.
()n the subject of Finance he forshadows
and discusses the evils of the unlimited
• coinage of silver; shows how, if unchecked
the country will he drained of gold, the
international money; silver coin will depre
values be unsettled, and boldly

The Press on the Message.
The press of the country, without respect
to party, have spoken of the President s
message to Congress in terms of commen
dation, with here and there an exception.
These two or three exceptions have charac
terized it as a plain businesslike document,
but “lacking brilliancy of expression and
novelty in suggestion.’’ This seems to
partake of hypercritcism. The truth is, Mr.
Cleveland is a terse and vigorous writer,
much on the style of William Cobbet, for
strength and cogency, and of Addison, for
simplicity and perspicuity. There is no
effort at fine writing or meretricious orna
ment, but his style is graceful, lucid, and
t-haste in diction. There are no stilted,
sonorous or high-sounding sentences, such
as a graduate would strive after on com
mencement day, but a pure and limpid
transparency, with nothing awkward or
involved about it. The President writes
pure English, in an easy and graceful style,
such as is suited to the plain, practical de
tails of business affairs with which such
state papers have chiefly to deal. If he
were writing a thesis to be read in some
j college or university, a style more ornate
1 might be deemed more appropriate. But
, the document just sent to Congress is ex
actly what it should he, a clear, comprehen
sive summary of the business operations of
the government, with such suggestions for
fresh legislation as the needs of the coun
try seem to require.
Exit Mahone.
The Democrats of the Virginia Legisla
ture have selected Hon. John W. Daniel to
succeed Mahone in the I uited States Sen
ate, and as they have two-thirds majority
in each house Major Daniel s caucus nom
ination is equivalent to an election. Major
Daniel was sworn in on Monday last as a
Representative of the Lynchburg district
in the House of Representatives, and will
: serve out his term there, which ends March
4, 1887, and will then go over to the other
end of the capitol. Although but forty
three years of age, he is one of the ablest
men in the country, and as an orator has
no superiors, if, indeed, any equals. Ihe
Democrats of Virginia arc to be compli
mented on the wisdom of their choice, and
the party throughout the country is to be
congratulated upon having so able and so
eloquent an advocate and defender of Dem
ocratic principles and policy in the upper
house of the national legislature.
The recent possibility of an interregnum
has prompted Congress to consider the
1 matter, and a law will probably be passed
providing against any possible vacancies in
the Presidency hereafter. Tlie law will
provide for the succession, after the death
' or inability of both the President and I'ice
President, to fall upon the Secretary of
1 State, and then in turn to the other mem
bers of the Cabinet. By a hill of this sort
1 party ascendancy would be continued
throughout the presidential term, in accor
dance with the popular will, as members of
the Cabinet are of the same political asso
ciatinii as the President, whereas the Pres
ident pro tern of the Senate or the Speaker
might not be. Besides, under the present
law, there might not be either a President
of the Senate or Speaker of the House, as
has twice occurred within four years.
The Maryland Democratic members of
Congress held a conference at the residence
of Senator Gorman last Friday night, all
being present except Senator Wilson, who
was not in Washington. Mr. Findlay was
not invited, of course, as he has placed him
self out of the Democratic party, although
elected as a Democrat. It was agreed that
those present would act as a unit in every
thing to come before Congress affecting the
interests of Baltimore and Maryland, and it
was resolved that the delegation would bend
all efforts to securing the necessary appro
priation for the widening of the ship chan
nel at Baltimore.
Wind, Snow and Cold.
A high wind prevailed on Friday of last
week al Kansas City and Riverview, Missouri,
the direction being from west and north.
Much damage was done to property, aud tel
graph wires were leveled in all directions. |
A workman was blown from a scaffold in
Kansas City and fatally injured, and in the 1
afternoon the children were dismissed from
three of the public schools because of the I
violence of the gale. In Riverview, Mrs. ;
Peterson was struck by flying boards aud so
badly injured that she died soon after.
A dispatch from Rurton, Kansas, says that
during the high wind a prairie fire broke out
seven miles north of that place, which swept
over an area of about thirty miles, destroying
one thousand stacks of hay and grain and
numbers of.slice]), hog and cattle sheds. The
cattle ranch of Tomlin & Webb, in Indian
Territory, was entirely destroyed, with from
four to six hundred head of cattle. Edward
Countryman was fatally burned, and Kohn
Seeper and John Berry are not expected to
live.
At Gaylord, Kansas, James Phillips was
killed and two of his sons were injured, one
mortally, while trying to secure the roof of a
barn during the wind storm.
A blizzard set in at St. Paul on the same
day, the snow being driven in blinding sheets
through the streets. Four inches of snow fell
at Duluth. The storm was general throughout
Manitoba, Dakota, Minnesota, Eastern Mon
tana and Northern Wisconsin and lowa.
The great storm of wind and snow which
prevailed throughout the Northwest on Thurs
day and Friday of last week cleared up by
Saturday morning, leaving the temperature ,
very low. The gale was exceptionally severe .
upon the Lakes. Railroad travel at various
points was interrupted by the snow. The •
temperature varied from 23° above zero at
Chicago to zero at St. Paul and 14° below zero I
at Winnipeg. At Omaha the velocity of the | ,
wind was 60 miles per hour, and trains were j
unable to cross the Union Pacific bridge. At
Central City, Nebraska, part of a new college j
building was blown down. Snow fell through- j
out Canada, the depth in the Province of j
Quebec being two feet on a level, and in On
tario from 6 inches to 4 feet.
The temperature in Chicago fell to zero at j
9 o’clock Sunday night. At Milwaukee it was ;
6° below zero. The severest snowstorm I
known in Cleveland, Ohio, for several years, j
raged there Sunday afternoon.
A heavy storm of wind and rain, accompa- j
nied by thunder and lightning, raged at Mali- i
fax, Nova Scotia, during Saturday night. j
Another terrible gale raged on the Lakes j
during Sunday, accompanied by furious snow (
squalls. There are fears for the safety of a
number of vessels which were out on Lake
Michigan. A temperature of one degree be
low zero was reported at Chicago on Monday o
morning. Fifteen below zero was reported at =
Ottawa, Canada; C below at Dubuque, Iowa;
14 below at Fargo. Dakota, and 20 below at y
Winnipeg, Manitoba.
A heavy snow storm set in 00 Toesday
norning at Chicago, the temperature rising
ibout twenty degrees. The depth of snow £
vas from six to eight inches. The storm ex- ®
ended west to the Rocky Mountains, and from -
Duluth to Omaha. At St. Paul the temper- |
itwe was 3 degrees above zero, and a colder , _
rave jtfas expected, likely to last for several i

Our Seacoast Defences.
I.oltcr from Samuel J. Tlltleu to Con
gressman Carlisle.
New York, Dec. 4.—Hon. Samuel J. Til
den has sent the following letter to Hon. John
G. Carlisle:
“Gbeystoxe, Yonkers, N. Y., December
1, 1885. —Dear Mr. Carlisle: As public opin
ion points to you as the Speaker of the next
House of Representatives, 1 desire to submit
a suggestion as to one of the public objects
for which an appropriation ought to be prompt
and liberal. In considering the state and
management of the public revenues, the sub
ject involves the questions whether we shall
extinguished the surplus hy reducing the
revenue ; or weather we shalll apply the
surplus to payments on the public debt;
or, whether we shall seize the occasion
to provide for our seacoast defences, which
have been long neglected. lam of the opin
ion that the latter is a paramount necessity
which ought to precede the reduction of the
revenue, and ought also to precede an exces
sive rapidity in the payment of the public
debt.
The property exposed to destruction in the
twelve seaports —Portland, Portsmouth, Bos
ton, Newport, New York, Philadelphia, Bal
timore, Charleston, Savannah, New Orleans,
Galveston and San Francisco —cannot be less
in value than $5,000,000,000. To this must
be added a vast amount of property depen
dent for its use on the seaports. Nor does
this statement afford a true measure of the
damage which might be caused to the prop
erty and business of the country by a failure
to protect these seaports from hostile naval |
attacks.
They are the centres not only to foreign j
commerce, hut of most of the internal trade )
and exchanges of domestic productions, io
this state of things the machinery of trans- j
portation of the whole country has become |
adapted. The interruption of the currents ot j
traffic by the occupation of one or more ot
our principal seaports by a foreign enemy, or j
the destruction of them hy bombardment, or j
the holding over them the menace of destruc
tion for the purpose of exacting contribution j
or ransom, would inflict upon the property !
and business of the country an injury which
can neither be foreseen nor measured. The
elaborate and costly fortifications, which were
constructed with the greatest engineering
skill, are now practically useless. They are
not capable of resisting the attacks of modern
artillery.
A still greater deficit exists in our coast de- 1
fences. The range of the best modern ar- j
tillery has become so extended that our pres
j ent fortifications designed to protect the har
j hor of New York, where two-thirds of the im
j port trade and more than one-half of the ex- j
1 port trade of the whole I nited States is car
' ried on, are too near to the great populations
of New York City, Jersey City and Brooklyn j
to be of any value as a protection.
To provide effectual defences would be the
work of years. It would take much time to j
construct permanent fortifications. A small
provision of the best modern guns would take
several years. Neither of these works can be ;
extemporized in presence of emergent danger.
A million of soldiers with the best equipments,
on the heights surrounding the harbor of
New York, in our present state of preparation,
or rather in our total want of preparation,
| would he powerless to resist a small squadron
of war steamers.
This state of things is discreditable to our
. foresight and to our prudence.
The best guarantee against aggression, the
best assurance that our diplomacy will he suc
cessful and pacific, and that our rights and
honor will he respected hy other nations is in
their knowledge that we are in a situation to
I vindicate our reputation and interests. Mhile
1 we may afford to be deficient in the means of
: offence, we cannot afford to be defenceless.
|*The notoriety of the fact that we have neglect
ed the ordinary precautions ot defence invites
want of consideration in our diplomacy, injus
tice, arrogance and insult at the hands ot
1 foreign nations. It is now more than sixty
years since we announced to the world that
we should resist any attempts, from whatever
quarter they might come, to make any new
j colonization on any part of the American
j continent; that while we should respect the
status quo, we should protect the people of
j the different nations inhabiting this continent
from every attempt to subject them to the
dominion of any European power, or to inter
fere with their undisturbed exercise ot the
rights of self-government. This announce
ment was formerly made hy President Monroe,
after consultation with Mr. Madison and Mr. |
Jefferson. It was formulated by John Quincy !
i Adams. Our Government has tirmlyadhered j
to the Monroe doctrine, and, even so late as !
1865, it warned Napoleon 111 out of Mexico. !
It is impossible to foresee in the recent scram- I
hie of the European powers for acquisition
of colonies how soon an occasion may arise
for our putting in practice the Monroe doc- j
trine, ft is clear that there ought to be some
relation between our assertion of that doc
trine aud our preparation to maintain it. It
is not intended to recommend any attempt
to rival the great European Powers in the
creation of a powerful navy. The changes ;
which have rapidly occurred by the diminu
tion of the relative resisting power of the de- |
fensive armor of iron-clads and by the in
creased efficiency of modern artillery, which
on the whole has gained in the competition,
suggest that we should not at present enter j
largely into the creation of armored vessels.
In the questions that beset this subject,
until they shall have reached a solution, we j
cau content ourselves with adding but sparing
ly to our navy. But what we do add should
be the very best that science and experience
can indicate. This prudential view is rein
forced hy the consideration that the annual 1
charge of maintaining a war vessel hears an
important proportion to the original cost of
construction. In constructing permanent for
tifications, and providing an ample supply of
the best modern artillery, the annual cost ot
maintenance is inconsiderable. Nearly the
whole expenditure is in the original outlay for
construction. If we do not make the expen
diture necessary to provide for our coast de
, fences when we have a surplus, and have no
need to levy new taxes, we certainly will not
1 make those expenditures when we have no lon
ger a surplus in the Treasury. To leave our
vast interests defenceless, in order to reduce
the cost of whisky to its consumers, would
be a solecism. The present time is peculiarly
favorable for providing for this great national
necessity too long neglected. Not only does 1
the surplus in the treasury supply ample <
means to meet this great public want without
laying new burdens upon the people, but the ,
work can now he done at a much lower cost ,
than has ever before been possible. The de
fensive works would consist almost entirely I
of steel and iron. These materials can now | J
be had at an unprecedented low price.
A vast supply of machinery and of labor, |
called into existence hy a great vicissitude in J
the steel and iron industries, offers itself to • J
our service. We should have the satisfac- '
tion of knowing that, while we were availing
ourselves of the supplies which would ordi- ] t
narily be unattainable, we were setting in c
motion important industries and giving em- r
ployment to labor in a period of depression.
With encouragement hy the guarantee of work, 1 j
or, perhaps, by the Government itself furnish- g
ing the plant, the inventive genius of our j ]
people would be applied to the creation of
new means aud improved machinery ; and
establishments would spring into existence '
capable of supplying all of the National wants, j
and rendering us completely independent of 1 j
all other countries in respect to the means of
National defence. 1 endeavored to impress .
these ideas upon Mr. Randall the last time I 1
had the pleasure of seeing him. ?
With my highest regards to Mrs. Carlisle ! 11
and yourself, 1 remain very truly yours, 0

Death of Wm. H. VanelQrhilt-
The ICiehest Man in the World Hies J J
Suddenly.
William H. Vanderbilt dropped dead at his h
residence in New York on Tuesday afternoon, c
lie was in the 65th year of his age. His p
death was entirely unexpected, and none of si
his family were with him at the time. He t’
was conversing with Mr. Robert Garrett, of si
Baltimore, when suddenly his speech became
indistinct and he fell forward on his face upon g
the floor, killed by the rupture of a blood 2
vessel at the base of the brain. It is the gen- ’[
eral opinion that Mr. Vanderbilt’s death will c
not in any way affect the management of the tl
great corporations with which he was con- a
nected, and that it will have but little effect
upon the stock market. Mr. Vanderbilt’s
wealth was estimated as high as $200,000,000,
and his income at $10,000,000 a year. He °
bad nine children, eight of whom and their k
motfier survive him, and there are nineteen 11
grandchildren, “

Logan and Blair, Senators-elect from Illinois
and New Hampshire respectively, were pre
sented and those gentlemen were sworn in.
Resolutions were adopted directing the Sec
retary to inform the House of Representatives

ident pro tempore. The usual committee was
also appointed to wait upon the President, in
conjunction with a similar committee of the
House, and inform him that Congress was
ready to receive any communication he might
be ready to make. A recess was then taken.
On reassembling, a communication was re
ceived from the House announcing its organi
zation, etc. Mr. Voorhecs then offered reso
lutions in regard to the death of Vice Presi
dent Hendricks, which were laid on the table
to be called up at a future day. The Senate
then, in respect to the me.raory of the Vice
President, adjourned until noon Tuesday.
In the House, John G. Carlisle, of Ken
tucky, was re-elected'Speaker, the Republi
cans voting for Thomas B. Reed, of Maine.
[ Mr. Carlisle, on taking the chair, made a
j speech acknowledging the honor conferred
j upon him, and calling attention to the im
j portance of the session just beginning. The
1 other officers of the House were then elected,
as nominated by the Democratic caucus.
The Clerk was directed to inform the Senate
j that the House was organized, and a coramit
! tee was appointed to wait upon the President
! together with the similar committee of the
! Senate. After the drawing of seats had been
finished, Mr. Holman, of Indiana, announced
j the death of Vice President Hendricks, and
! the House then, as a mark of respect, ad
i journed.
TUESDAY.
In the United States Senate on Tuesday the
I first message of President Cleveland was re
| ceived and read. A memorial was presented,
| from the Legislature of New Hampshire set
j ting forth that twenty millions of acres of the
lands of the United States are held by non
| resident aliens, and asking Congressional leg
| islation that may secure exclusively to the
j American people the public lands of the
; United States and prevent their sale to per
sons other than citizens and those intending
jto become such. Bills were introduced by
| Mr. Hoar, to regulate the Presidential suc-
I cession, to establish a Court of Appeals, and

of Penna., ottered a resolution, which was
read and referred to the Committee on Fi
nance, declaring against the expediency of
any further reduction of the tariff. Nr.
Plumb, by request, introduced a joint resolu
tion proposing a constitutional amendment
for the suppression of the manufacture and
sale of liquor. The Senate at this point ed- {

In the House the President's message was !
read, and the Speaker appointed the Com- |
mittee on Mileage, with Mr. Rogers, of Ar- I
kansas, as chairman. Mr. Hopkins, of Illi- j
nois, announced the death of his predecessor, j
Reuben Elwood, and the House, as a mark of I
respect adjourned.
WEDNESDAY.
In the Senate on Wednesday a number of
: bills were introduced, some of no special j
importance. Mr. Blair introduced resolutions j
proposing woman suffrage and prohibition
! amendments to the Constitution, and Mr. I
Gibson introduced a resolution giving notice
I of the termination of the treaty with the |
: Hawaiian Islands. Mr. Hale offered a reso- j
lution, which was agreed to, directing the

ceived from our Consul General at Paris, or
I from our special agent sent to financial cen
tres of Europe, in respect to the establishment
of such an international ratio of gold and sil

) A telegram from Pittsburg tells the follow-
I ing story: “At Barkerville, a hamlet in a
remote corner of Venango county, Professor
W. F. Yates, of the Barkerville Academy,
and a minister of the Church of God, in
curred the enmity of ex-Elder C. W. Kountz,
who had been expelled from the church.
Kountz has gathered around him a religious
sect who look upon him as a prophet. A
plot was arranged to break into Yates’ house
and carry him to their meeting, and compel
him to listen to their doctrines, but the plot
failed because of the absence of Professor
Yates. The following evening the mob met
him on the street and stoned him until he
dropped insensible. He is believed to be fa
tally injured. If Yates dies his friends threat
en to lynch his assailants.
Another disaster happened on Monday in
1 the new Croton aqueduct. The scene was
No. 3 shaft, at Merritt’s Corners, Westches
ter county, New York. While men were de
scending the shaft in a bucket, a cross beam
used to steady the bucket caught in the
shaft. It remained fast until the bucket had
almost reached the bottom, when it broke
loose and fell from a height of one hundred
feet upon the heads of the men. Four men
were killed, and another so badly injured
that his recovery is doubtful. This makes
eight men killed in the aqueduct within two
weeks. Two more men were killed in the
new Croton Aqueduct on Tuesday, one at
Merritt's Corners, the other a short distance
from Croton Lake. The New York Telegram
says that since the aqueduct was begun thirty
four men have been killed and twenty-seven
injured in the work.
Owing to “inadequate pipage” the supply
of natural gas at Pittsburg and Allegheny J
City gave out Monday. Hundreds of fam
ilies had to resort to laundry stoves for cook
ing purposes, several factories suspended
work, clerks wore their overcoats and the
scholars in the public schools were dismissed. |
A similar annoyance was experienced from |-
one to ten o'clock P. M. on Sunday in the
towns of Beaver Falls and New Brighton. |
These towns were cut off from their supply of
natural gas in order that connections might ;
be made with the Rochester main. As the |
cold was intense, many families went to bed
to keep warm, or visited the houses of the
neighbors who still use the old-fashioned fuel |
coal. No suppers could be cooked, and the
restaurants using coal did a v er y large bUsi- i
ness. The hotel guests abandoned the hotels
and no evening services were held in the '
churches. Factories which run all night had
to shut down, and it is thought that consid
erable loss will be incurred by the glass houses j
and pottery from the cooling of the pots and j
kilns. When the gas was turned on, at 10 \
o’clock, many persons got out of their beds j
to cook supper.
The War Department recently received I
such reports from Utah of the feeling among
the Mormons, growing out of the enforce”
inent of the laws against polygamy, that it
was determined to send troops to Salt Lake
as a precautionary measure. The recent
shooting of a Mormon by a U. S. Marshal in- ;
tensified the excitement, and apprehension 1
was felt at Salt Lake that there would be an j i
uprising. A battery of artillery was recently ! <
ordered from Omaho to Fort Douglass, which •
is situated a few miles from Salt Lake City. <
This movement, however, was not particular
ly on account of any fear of a Mormon re- j
hellion, but had been in contemplation for |
some time. The force now at Fort Douglass j
consists of a full regiment of infantry and a I -
battery of artillery, and is qnder the com- I
maud of General McCook. In the event of
trouble in Utah all the troops in the Depart- i
ment of the Platte, consisting of about 3000 ’
men, could be concentrated at Fort Douglass *
in a very few hours. No serious trouble, £
however, is apprehended by army officials. 1
A despatch received from Salt Lake City
last Sunday night says that everything there
is quiet, and there is no probability of trouble. '
Another terrible explosion of natural gas -
occurred on Friday of last week in Pittsburg,
involving three houses on Grant street. A t
six-inch main runs along the street, but as it I
has no connections with the houses in the c
square where the disaster took place, the a
cause is attributed to leaks. About four
o’clock in the afternoon, Kate Griffin, domes
tic in the house of Mrs. Meehan, started for
the cellar for coal.- with a light. At the cel- ~
lar door, a Mrs. Phipps held the lamp, and -
as soon as the door was opened the gas rushed
out and ignited. The explosion that ensued j
was immediately followed by similar explo- ; "
dons in the adjoining cellars of Louis Fayilla ,
fruit dealer, and J. Flannery, undertaker!
Alien the neighbors rushed to t|ie §ceqe they
bund in the Meehan house Kate Griffin with 1
ter clothes burned off and blood flowing from
i gash in her side, and near her Mrs. Phipps fc
n flames. Kate Griffin is not expected to C
•epoyer; Mrs. Phipps, it is thqught, ipay sur- 1
rive. In Fayilla's house Mrs. Favilla and
ier neighbor, J. E. Case, were seriously in
ured by falling debris. Flannery’s bqilding, 1 -
l three-story structure, was completely de- i
troyed by fire. The two other houses were *
o badly wrecked that they will have to be 6
lulled down.
Work of the Fiery Element.
The Seipp building, a four-story’ structu ro
on Franklin street, near Van Buren, Chicago,
. was destroyed by fire last Sunday afternoon.
. The total loss is estimated at $300,000. The
, temperature being near zero, the firemen were
completely coated with ice, the streets and
sidewalks were frozen over, and the adjoining
! buildings looked like “spectacular icebergs.”
The oil mills of J. P. Mills & Co., in In
-5 dianapolis, were burned Sunday afternoon,
with about 100,000 bushels of flaxseed. 25,000
3 gallons of oil and a considerable quantity ot
1 oil cake. The loss is estimated at nearly
3 $150,000.
3 A fire in Etna, Pa., on Saturday night, de
stroyed eight frame houses,
i Cribben & Sexton's stove warehouse in
i Chicago, a five-story brick building, was
- burned on Sunday night. The total loss on
i the building and its contents is estimated at
; about $290,000, and the insurance aggregates
$155,000. Two firemen were injured by a
, falling wall, one of them having a leg broken.
The Daisy and Empire Flour Mills in Mil
r waukee were destroyed by fire on Tuesday
[ morning. The loss is estimated at $200,000.
Soon after the tire broke out in the Daisy
Mill an explosion occurred, injuring four fire
men, one of them, it is feared, fatally.
5 The college of the Presbyterian Educational
' Institute, at York, Pa., was burned on Mon
' day. The building originally cost $60,000.
! About 2 o'clock on Sunday morning Gettys
r burg, Pa., was aroused by one of the most
• threatening fires in its history. The flames were
first seen to issue from the roof of the kitchen
I on the Philip Winter property—occupied by
i Martin Winter as an office and the dwelling
I by the family, and the store and warehouse by
Wm. Spangler —on Chambersburg street, half
I a dozen doors from Centre Square. The tire
■ soon communicated with the warehouse, a
! two-story frame, and then to the McConaughy
law building on the west and his residence on
1 the east. It looked for a time as if the block
> to the square must go, with many buildings
I outside in great danger, sparks having ignited
several roofs. However, the water supply
proving inexhaustible, and the pluck and per
sistence of the boys unflagging, the tire fiend
i was held at bay, and after two hours hard
fighting the flames succumbed and everything
became safe again. The losses embrace the
Winter warehouse, with contents belonging
to Mr. Spangler, and the upper stories of the
Winter and two McConaughy front buildings,
with the backbuildings entirely burned out.
The losers are- all insured.

QAK HALL STILL the LEADER.
A Merry Christmas and a Happy
New Year to All,

A few plain facts from Oak Hall to be placed

The question has often been asked of us
why we were always busy when others ap- (
pearantly were doing nothing. Our answer ,
is we advertise nothing but what we have; we
place no fictitious value on our goods; we buy
for cash, and with an eye to the taste of our
customers, we can show you one of the pret
tiest assortments of goods in the county, at
the lowest market prices, which insures quick ■
sale. Our increase trade is ample evidence
of the truthfulness of the above.
Encouraged by our large fall trade we have
purchased a very handsome line of Christmas
goods, such as Silk Plush Comb Cases, Hand
kerchief Boxes, Vases, Shell Boxes, Toilet *
Sets, Glass Sets, Scrap Books, Autograph and
! Silk Plush Albums, Satchels, Gent’s Silk 1
Muflers, Fur Collars, Ladies' Muffs. We £
have about -10 to 50 dozen Silk and Linen
Handkerchiefs to select from; Wolf Robes,
Plush Robes, Silverware in great variety. 1
All our goods are marked as the plating; c
Napkin Rings, silver, from 25 cts. up; Cas- h
tors, Butter Dishes, Knives and Forks, c
Spoons, Cake Stands, Lamps in great variety; t

to reduce our stock. We have about 2 dozen C

] propose to give away as Christmas presents j h
jto the Boys, valued at 50 cts. to §I.OO. Re- g
