VOLUME LXXIII-NO. 6.
MERELY A TRUST.
No State Can Alienate Its
Rights.
LAND THAT THE PEOPLE OWN.
A Decision That Would Seem Par
ticularly Apropos to Oakland's
Water-Front Suit.
Sr-ecial to Thi Mornint, Call.
Washington, Dec. 3.— The United
States Supreme Court to-day affirmed the
Judgment of the United Stated Circuit
Court in the well-known Chicago lake-front
cases. The lower court decided In favor of
tbe cltv, holding that the Illinois Central
did not own riparian rights nnd could not
use the submerged lands along tho lnke
froni, ami enioiuiug its right of way, for
wharves, tiers. et<\ The coatroversjr has
been goin? on for many years, and involved
property worth millions of dollars and
whatlim; privileges which aro beyond esti
mates.
The case arose over tbe rival claim of the
Illinois Central Kailroad and the State of
Illinois, t lit* city oi Chicago nnd the United
S.a'es to title to the submerged lands along
about two miles of the lake shore, opposite
the business heart of Chicago, where the
Government has spent large sums in the
construction of a harbcr. The claim of the
railroads arose from an act of the State
Legislature in 1801, granting the railroads
the right-01-way over these eubmeitred
lands to its depot Under this the nad
claimed title. Uistice llarlan of the Cir
cuit Court, frcni wru>e jodsment t!;-' road
appealed, confirmed the title of the com
pany to the lands occupied and reclaimed,
but denied its right to the submersed lauds
in front of it s right-01-way. The Supreme
Court ni Alfiefl this d;> i?:od, ordering an in
vestigation as to certain piei* which the
road has built, to determine whether they
ar » in navigable waters. It finds the titie
to these lands in the State of Illinois. Tbe
opinion was concurred in by Justices Field,
iltrlan, Lamar and Brewer. Justices
Urown, Gr..y aud S:ira« dissented. Chief
Justice Fuller and Justice Blatchford did
not tako part, being interested in the
decision.
The opinion of Justice Field on this case
The opinion of Justice Field on this case
!s one of great importance, aside evea from
the value of the property in controversy.
To a considerable extent it laysdjwn new
laws. The controlling spirit of the decision
is the sovereignty of the people over even
their own legislatures.. The opinion is
Tery long and elaborate.
After the points mentioned above it comes
down to the chief question in the case, viz.,
the right of the Illinois Central Company to
take for its own use the submerged" lands
extending into Lake Michigan .from the
shore to the line of the road. The court
brushed aside the technical points made as
to the granting act of 1809. and, squarely
meeting the proposition that by this act tie
Legislature exceeded its authority, say* that
the State's title to the lands under the
navigable waters of Lake Michigan is dif
ferent in character from f rom which the State
holds to its lands intended for sale. It is a
title held in trust for the people of the
State, that they may eujoy the navigation of
the waters, carry on commerce over them,
and have the liberty of fishing therein, free
from the obstruction or interference of
private parties. The State can no more
abdicate its trust over property ip which ihe
whole people are interested, like navigable
craters and the soils under them, so as to
leave them entirely to the use and control
of private parties, than it can abdicate its
powers In the administration of govern
ment and the preservation of peace. In
the administration of governmenut the use
of such powers may for a limited period be
delegated to a municipality or some other
body, bat there always remains with the
Slate the right to revoke those powers and
exercise them in a more direct manner, and
one more conformable to its wishes. So
with trusts connected with public property
of a special character, like lands under nav
igable waters. hey cannot' be placed en
tirely beyond the discretion and control of
the State.
The harbor of Chicago is of immense
ta'ue to the people of the State of Illinois
in th 6 facilities it affurds to its vast and
constantly increasing commerce, aud the
Idea that its Legislature can deprive the
State of control over its bed aud waters,
and place the same in the handsof a private
corporation created for different purposes,
one limited to the transportation of passen
gers and freight between distant points and
tbe city of Chicago, is a proposition that
cannot be defended. The area of the sub
merged lands in questiou is as large as that
embraced by all the merchandise docks
along the Thames at London, much larger
than that included in the famous docks and
basins at Liverpool, twice that of the port
of Mnr«eilies, and nearly if not quite canal
to the pier area along the water front of the
elty of Nc.v York. And the arrivals and
clearings of vessels at the port exceed in
number those of New York and are equal to
those of New York and Boston combined.
It is hai.ily conceivable that the Legisla
ture can divest the State of the control over
the management of this harbor and vest it
absolutely in a private corporation.
Any grant of this kind is necessarily rev
ocable, and the exercise of the trust by
which the property Is held by the State cau
b« resumed at any time.
The opinion also affirms the decree of the
lower court as respects the city's claim to
ownership of street?, alleys and other pub
lic grounds on the reclaimed lands.
Justice Shiras, id an oral dissent, said
that in his opinion the erant of the Stata to
the Illinois Central Railway Company was a
Talid Erant, which conttituted a contract
between the railway and the Stata, and one
which could not be taken away by a subse
quent arbitrary act. The Legislature of the
State could regulate the use of the riparian
waters by the railway company to protect
the public interests.
The effects of the decision were more
directly against the railway company than
the decisions of Justice Marian and Judge
Elodgett in the Circuit Court, for it makes
possible the loss by tne company of some of
the pier property it now occupies.
EXTRA SESSION TALK.
Democratic Leaders Turning in Favor
of the Project.
Wasiijngston, Dec. s.— Extra session
was the talk on tho floor of both tho House
and Senate to-day. The Democrats scrm to
be hopelessly divided in opinion and groups
could be seen everywhere at the Capitol
earnestly Mteottteg the matter. Repre
sentative llcMUUb'i ext ression la favor of
an ex ra session was a surprise to his col
leagues, as he was thought to be averse to
It. R- preseutative Wilson, another of the
Democratic leaders, also favors an extra
scsti v, and the irfluence of such men is
having its effect. It can be said that with
each day the extra-session sentiment
grows stronger. The plan of having an ex
tra session fixed by this Congress meets
with a diversity of views, the opinion
generally expressed being tnat the present
Congress could not fix the time for holding
• session of the Filty-tUrd Congress with
out a constitutional enactment.
lie: resentative Hooker's resolution of to
day, providing for the assembling of Con
gress in March, does not meet with general
favor.

this country: "The report is not exact. It
is true, by letters dated from the beginning
of last month, I have received authority to
examine and decide, without peal, con
troversies arising between the Bishops and
priests etc., la the United State?, but it is
absurd to ascribe to me place and authority

Cardinal Gibbons, tor whom the Apostolic
delegate entertains the highest veneration
and special affection, he preserves all the
dignity and authority which belong to his
office. There Is no reason for surprise In
this rase, as the Pope is accustomed to send
delegates from time to time to various
countries on similar missions with similar
powers."

PEACE IN SAMOA.
The Treaty Powers Will Give a New

Washington', Dec. s.— lnquiry at the de

learned that ships have been sent by the
three nations to preserve peace in Samoa,
and the agreement is that each Government

THE CHILEAN TREATY.
It Will Probably Be Sent to the
Senate To- Day.
Provision Hade for the Appointment of
a Commission to Settle the
Keweenaw Claims.
Special to The Morning Cali. •
Washington*. Dec. 5 —The attorney for
thirty-seven of the Baltimore's men who
have claims for damages against Chile is in
the city. The amount agreed upon by
Chile was $75,000, and the attorney is here
to get the money. lie said to The Call
correspondent: "When Mr. E;an came up
from Chile recently he brought with him a
draft for 175,090 to settle the Baltimore
claims. It was drawn on the Chilean Min
ister in Paris at thirty days. It was at
once sent on for collection and 1 suppose
the money will be nere and available for
distribution in the course of a few days.
"I believe it has not yet been definitely
settled just how the division ot the money
will be m ide, but the matter has been
turned over by the State Department to the
Navy Department, and, I presume, a
board loi naval officers will be appointed
to make allotments in accordance with the
medical evidence. This should not take a
great amount ot time— not more than a few
weeks— lnasmuch as the medical evidence
in ail in band a& a result of the Baltimore
inquiry." .v. . -.^»U*:,
The claims of the two American mer
chant sailors. Shields and McKinstrey, will
also probably come up for settlement be
fsre very long.
Minister Egan brought up with him from
Chile the diaft of the treaty which the
President will eend to the Senate for ratifi
cation, possibly when he sends his message.
Among other things the treaty provides
for the appointment of a board of arbitra
tion to settle tie Keweenaw claims. This
board is to meet in Washington within six
months of the ratification of the treaty, and
will consist of three members— or.c Chilean,
one from this country and the third to De
chosen by the other two.
The case of Shields is a peculiarly aggra
vated one, and was specially referred to by
President Harrison in his message to Con
gress on the Chilean affair. Shields Is still
confined in the Marine Hospital in San
Francisco, suffering from epileptic fits, the
result, so his physicians say, of injuries to
his brai» or spine that he received during
his confinement In the jail at Valparaiso.
When he was first seen by the surgeous of
the Baltimore, according to their account,
he was black and blue from his head to his
hips, and he will probably never recover
from the injuries he received during his
confinement. V (,V

Omaha. Dec. s —Jacob Gerber has re
turned to this city, having escaped from a
iSiberian exile, to which ho was condeir.r.ed
one year and n half ago. He tells a horri

ORANGES FOR LONDON.
The First Shipment Successfully Made
From Florida.
New York, Dec 5.— A cable dispatch

left Femandiua, Fla., on November 1"), with
the first cargo of Florida oranges ever ex
ported direct to England, reached London
yesterday and 9065 t>ox*s, comprising her
cargo, will be so d at auction on Tuesday.
F. L. Goodsell chartered and loaded the
steamer, as the necessity of an outlet had
become apparent, owing to the fact that the
United Stales produces about 0,000,000 boxes
of oranges which la in excess of the home
consumption with profitable results.

WRATH SOFTLY TURNED AWAY
Whatever May Be Said of the Kaiser
Me Has at Least the Gift of
Placating Foes.
Special to The Husn-i.no Call
New Yokk, Dec. s.— Edmund Tntes' let
ter to the Tribune from London has this:
The Gennnn Emperor's recent bestowal of
the Black Kagie. the order of the Garter of
Prussia, en Prince Henry of Keuss, had a
ifgßhScanea that was commented on at the
tiruo by none of the correspondents who
might havo pointed out that t lie act denoted
ft complete reconciliation between the little
principal ty nnd the house of Prussia, or,
ns one Berlin Journal exclaimed, "Germany
mm- congratulate herselT that she is now
completely unified." For gome reason or
other Piince Henry of Keu*s continued to
bear a grudge iigainst Berlin, so deep that
when it was once proposed to erect a statue
to the 01-l Empeior William within hU ter
ritory, the Prtnca would not hear of the
movement and sternly set his face azaiDst It.
All this is past since btgfc decorations have
been exchanged and heilths have been
drunk, and it rm:<t indeed be said that
whatever may be the faults of the Emperor,
h« has at least done much to reduce the
bulk of the family quatffiJs and estrange
ments which he inherited Inm his grand
father. Wltaeo, for example, to speak of
nothing else, his partial agreement with the
f Cumberland, and his comulcte
reconciliation with the houses of Hesse-
Nassau and Keiiss.
Should the rumorof the approaching visit
of President Harrison to this country prove

Giant's case, will probably present him

If the Sutherland will rase come? Into
court it Will to one of the most sensational
on record, and some very extraordinary
revelations may be looked tor. The late
Duke executed his list will— he had BMde
several — on August 4, only a lew
weeks before hit death. He charged
lil* estates with a jointure for the
Dowager Duchess of £'Mh)o a year,
and left her a legacy of £100,000, to be paid
within twelve months after his death ; hUo
the estate of Sidaway, in Stafford* hi it-, and
t!.o >.ise of the Littensor Chase residence,
near Trentham, for twenty-one years, as
well as a vast quantity of fur
niture, p'a'<\ jewelry, pictures and
objfVs or art. The Duke leaves all or his
interest in certain Staffordshire collieries to
trustee, who are to pay the income to ihe
Dowager Duchess during her life, after
which the property is to pass to testator's
graud«on, Eric Chaplin, son of his daugh
ter. Lady Florence, and Henry Chaplin.
Ti e residue of the real aud p<»r*onal estate
is left to trustee*, who are to pay ttio in
come to the Dowager Duchess, who has the
power of appointment orer the whole prop
erty, the wish being expressed in the will
that this power may be exercised in favor
ol the family <,f Ihe te-Mator. There Is a
legacy of £I^ooo to Mi<s Blair, the daughter
of the Dowager Duchess, by a cotffcU c\e
ruted at Dunrohin on the day of the DaaVl
death. He bequeathed, further, an absolute
legacy of £30,000 to the Dowager Duchess.

It is rumore.i that the foreign anarchists
who have found an asylum in England
threaten reprisals here for the surrender of

tax, which amounts to STi-0.000, if the
$70,C00.<» 0 estiumte of the value of the es
tate is correct. Comptroller Myers said to
day there is no way of evading the tax ex
cept to assign the property, "if Gould's
estate was left in trust for the benefit of his
children during life, it is taxable," the
Comptroller said, "the same as if it were

Epeclal to The Morning Call.
New YortK, Dec s.— ln the Briggs caso
to-day the defendant submitted his evi
dence, which was even more voluminous
than that of the prosecution. When he
had finished reading his address Colonel
McCook arose and demanded that defend
ant be sworn as to the testimony tie bad
read, in conformity with the "book." Briggs
said the prosecution wanted the advantage
of cross-examining him before he had sub
ii:iu.-.i hH-«»vnt -oral crrdrucr. — 'Pfrrs-wns
the most outrageous course of conduct he had
ever heard prop- sod. McCook did not think
it an outrage and would waivo tho point, but
would like to have his exception saved. After
some further diM««tioa Moderator Bliss de
cided that Brigcs* distinction between oral
and documentary «\idefice was well taken.
This brought down an avalanche of ap
plause and some hisses, both from the bo :v
of the hall aud from tic galleries. Dr.
Payson became great excited, and said
that if such an exhibition was repeated he
would insist that the galleries be cleared.
McCook offered an exception to the moder
a«or'3 decision. Dr. Francis Brown's mo
tion that the decision be accepted as that of
the presbytery was carried by a large
majority. Dr. Birch, chairman of the prose

IN THE HOUSE.

NEW STATHS.
Republican Senators Caucus Upon
Arizona and .New iMexico.
Wa-uiv . •. 1 •-• . :>. >Al *-onn as the
benate tdjourood the Republican Senators
held a caucus, but reached no conclusion's.
It was thought that the auti-optlcns bill
would be the subject of discussion at the
caucus but it is stated that it was not
brought up at all. Tim present composi
tion of the committees w.is discussed, as
were also the two b Us for the admission
of Arizona and New Mexico, but no action
was taken. It was made apparent, how
ever, that ao the statehood bills would be
vigorously pressed by the Democratic Sen
ators there would be a demand for the
adoption of some Boifom policy upon the
subject by Republican Senators. At pres
ent ninny of them, probably a majority, are
opposed to the bill?, the objections being
ostensibly based on the illiteracy of a large
part of the population of Anzoua and New
Mexico; the fact that many of the inhab
itants of the Territories aro not American
ized, but speak only the Spanish language,
and the lack cf population. But back of
these objections lies the fact that the two
Territories are now represented by Demo
cratic delegates and might be expected to
■end Democratic benators. Some of the
Republican Senators, however, feel that if
the new States should be admitted by the
act of the Republican Souate and a Repub
lican President they might be brought into
the Republican f.dd, while to reject their
application now night be to insure IMb
admission after the 4th of March by a Dem
ocratic Senate, and tlius hopelessly alienate
the new Mates from the Republican party.
It is evident that Delegate Came of Utah
expects an effort will be made this winter
to admit Utah Territory. He professes to
believe that^ome of the Reuublican Sena
tors will bo willing to vote for admission as
a matter of policy, as it is not sate that
the Dfin.ocrati are In a majority there, not
withstanding the result of the recent elec
tion. Mr. ('aide's calculations c.mnot bo
correct, however, for it is almost certain no
Republican Senator could be found willing
to admit Utah under tht existing condi
tions. Some of the Democrats are likewise
opposed to an admission. Senator Voor
hees of Judiana s.iid to Thk Call corre
spondent that he could not vote for Utah's
admission uuless the Territory rejected
polygamy by a constitutional enactment.
lix-Guvernor Caleb F. Wast, formerly of
Kentucky, and Colonel Lett of Utah ..re
most prominently mentioned in connection
with the U'ah governorship to succeed
Thomas, the iucuaibent. Ex - Governor
Weil's chances should be very good, as he
will again have the cordial support of Sena
tors Carlislo and Blackburn.
Another desperate effort will be made
this winter to abolish the Utah Commission.
The saliriei of the members were last ses
sion reduced from 85000 to 82000, and Rep
resentative D.-.ckery, a member of the Ap
propriations Committee, says the commis
sion is a useless body and ihould now be
abolished entirely.
To fleet the Shortage.
Washington,'- Dec. 5.— A bill providing
for the issue of 870,000,000 in bonds, redeem
able In coin at the option of the United
States after ten yea i s, was introduced in the
Ilouse to-day, the proceeds tr> be applied to
the payment of the deficiency in tho United
Scates treasury. The bili was introduced
by Representative Arninerman of Pennsyl
rania and referred to the Ifayi and Means
Committee.
WARSHIPS ON THE LAKES.
England Will Probably Have a Word
to Say to That.
Washington, Dec. s.— An Interesting
document on the subject of war vessels on
the lakes will be sent to the Senate by the
State Department during the week. The
information was asked for by a resolution
passed in the early part of the last session,
and cousiderahie surprise has been ex
pressed that a reply had not been received
before Congress adjourned. The object of
the resolution was to make the State De
partment show cause why the act passed in
18txi, requiring notice to bo given to Great
Britain of the desire of the United States to
abrogate the treaty regarding the number
of vessels to be kept on the lakes, had not
been carried out. The reply of the depart
ment will be the basis for CMgnMtoaaJ
legislation looking to a modification of the
treaty which will admit of the construction
of war vessels by firms on the lakes. The
State Department has been accused of
evadiuK th« joint resolution calling for the
abrogation of the treaty. There are some
people who think the treaty has been
abrogated. There is no doubt such a reac
tion passed, and it is on record that notice
was ziven to Great Britain in accordance
therewith of tho intention of this Govern
ment to abrogate the treaty. What followed
is a mystery outside the diplomatic world.
It is understood that a statement will show
that nolicw wns issued under the act and
withdrawn within a few d*ys after it was
issued, and that for reasons then existing
both countries agreed to consider the treaty
siiil in force. It will be further ifcowa that
the treaty has been «o retarded to the pres
ent day by both Governments notwith
standing the act oi" l^*;.
WANAMAKER'S REPORT
Improvements Made in the Na
tion's flail Service.
Postal Notes Should Pass Current, and
• There Should Be Free Delivery
of Letters Everywhere.
I ecial to The Morning Call.
Washington, Dec. s.— The Postmaster-
General in his annual report mentions,
amove the chief developments of the year,
that $"..000,000 have been added to the gross
revenue of the department; that the deficit
has been reduced nearly Si, (00,000; the
money-order offices have been increased
from 10,070 to IG,GS9; eighty-two cities have
been supplied with the free delivery system;
2730 new offices hive been established; 263
have been advanced to the Presidential
grade; there have been established It;, 750,000
miles of additional service; 1590 new mail
routes have been established, embracing
3500 miles of new serv'ce; the ocean mail
service has been extended; the pneumatic
tube service was introduced, saving
$1,000,000 on mail contracts and 5150,000 on
stamped paper; th« 50 per cent expended up
to July 1 last fur foreign mail vice per
formed and expedited under the new policy
was 5120,579, and the cost of the service
during the present fiscal year will be
greater. •
On outside delivery, the Postmaster-
General fays the experiments were con
fined to villages but it has been a daily ser
vic^rand has cleared a profit It is easy
enough, therefore, to say that free delivery
can be extended further and further, and it
ought to be done, whether it pays a profit to
the department or not. He believes fully
that great advances could be made in the
direction of country free, delivery by the
evolution of the star route service, and we
would see free delivery to persons living
along highways traversed by the star route
contractors with little, it an y, Increased cost
in the department, in a very few years.
Postal telegraphs and telephones are
strenuously advocated, as in former years.
Of the one-cent postage system W'ana
mßkersays that this is a near possibility.
He urges the reduction of money-order fee?,
the simplification of the . postal note so that
it better answer the need of a fractional
currency, and the abolition of dot rents.
In closing ho says that his ideal for the
American postal service is a system modeled
upon the district plan, with fewer offices,
and those grouped around central offices and
under thorough supervision. By this means
at least 20,000 offices could bo abandoned
that produce nothing to the department.
In place of every one Abolished might be
pat an automatic stamp-selling machine
and a letter-box to receive mail. With the
money thus saved should be instituted a
system of collection and delivery by
mounted carriers, bicycles and star route
messengers and contractors, and generally
spread free delivery all over the country.
The classes of postage should be reduced to
three, and the rate of postage the world
over to 1 cent for each half ounce. The or
ganization of the department should be per
manent, except in the case of the Post
master-General and the Fourth Assistant,
and Mr. Wanamaker would add three new
offices— a Deputy Postmaster-General at
New York and another at San "Francisco,
and a Controller at Washington.
All postmasters. Presidential and fourth
c'as?, and all persons employed in ail the
branches of the department should have a
specific term of four year*, od good be
havior, and should be entitled to reappoint
ment, subject to the Controller. He would
unify work, build it up by a strong con
trolling hand, reduce the hours of labor at
almost all points, equalize an 1 advance the
pity, make promotions in every branch for
merit alone, and retire all old or disabled
clerks, perhaps on a pension fuud to be
provided by the annual payment cf one
half of 1 per cent of each month's salary.
The postal telegraph and telephone ser
vice, postal savings depositories pneumatic
tuhes or some electrical device between city
sub-stations, maiu ofiices and ferries, rail
road stations and central offices in all trio
large cities should be employed without de
lay.
The erection of immense and costly build
ing for uostoffices ought to be stopped, and
the department should be allowed to spend
a fixed sum of from $1,000,000 to 55,000,000
each year in the erection of buildings upon
a fixed plan, such as Postmaster-General
Vilas recommended.
He would modify the system of fines and
deductions upon tlia railroads and establish
a system of compensation, based upon
speed— on a twenty, Unity, forty, fifty or
sixty mile an hour rate.

ENGLAND IS OPPOSED TO IT.
Her Delegates Hard at Work to Block :
the Progress of the flone
tary Conference.
Special to The Mof.nino Cali. ,
Bkussels, Dee. ;5. — When the inter
national monetary conference- resumes its
sittings to-morrow the first matter requir
ing settlement will bo whether the report
of the committee appointed to consider
Rothschild's plan shall be further debated
or the proposals of the American delegates
proceeded with. Rothschild, Sir C. Fre
mnntle and Sir William Mouidsworth,
British delegate, desire some expression of
opinion regarding the Rothschild plan from
the full conference. Bertram Currip, an
other British delegate, aims to bring the
conference to a speedy close, and, in com
mon with some other delegates who are re
signed to see the conference result in a
failure, would accelerate the consideration
of the American resolutions as hastening to
the winding up of the meeting.
Fremautle, with a view to the resumption
of debate on the Kothsehild plan, has
amended his declaration declining to pledge
the English Government to withdraw its
half-sovereign pieces in favor of silver, by
adding the words: "Except concurrently
with the adoption of the Rothschild pro
ject or some other proposal having the same
compensatory value." Fremantle, "who is
Deputy Master of the British Mint, has
never been known to take independent ac
tion or personal initiative; therefore it is
taken for granted that he is the mouth
piece of the British Government in an
nouncing assent to the abolition of the half
sovereign, j *
The possibility of the repeal of the Sher
man act was much discussed among the
members of the conference to-day, and the
opinion was that it would be a serious blow
unless accompanied by some other special
legislation in.support of silver. The Inde
pendance Beige says: The committee will
to-day examine into the proposal of C. F.
Teitjen, the Danish delegate. The proposal
provides that an international union be
formed to fix the relative value of gold and
silver on the basis of the average rice of
silver in London dining the formation of
the union. The members of the union will
bo permitted to coin an unlimited amount
of silver to the value of $1, which will have
an unlimited debt-paying power in the
countries where they are coined. -The
scheme provides for the appoint
ment of a committee to watch the
silver market. If the value of that
metal falls 5 per cent below the value fixed
the committee will have power to decide
whether a fresh Issue of silver coin is
necessary. Every bank of issue will have
the right to have a portion of the metallic
reserve in silver coin of the union, with the
distinction that on six months' notice the
nation can demand that the silver coins held
in the ink's treasury be repaid in cold by
the country whence the coins came.
SILVER IN THE SOUTHWEST.

EL Pa<=o. Tex., Dee. s.— The Southwest
Silver convention convened this afternoon
with about JOO delegates and many visitors
present. A temporary organization was
effected witli Mr. Scott of Arizona as presi
dent, and 11. B. Holt of New Mexico as sec
retary. The business will open ud to-mor

Washington, Dec. 5. — The Treasury De
partment to-day purchased 300,000 ounces of
silver at .5494 to MQ& per ounce.
NOT DR. TYNAN.
The Stockton Mystery Remains Un
solved.
Stockton, Deo. 5. — It was settled to-day
by examination ot the remains that the
arms of a human being found a short time
■go in Stockton Channel were not members
of the body of Dr. Tynan of Modesto, who
was last seen in San Francisco, October 16.
when he drew $5000 Ironi a bank and
started for Modesto. The remains were un
covered by the Coroner to-day.
Mrs. Tynan drova out to the cemetery,
accompanied by several friend*, and sat in
her carriage while Coroner Clark exposed
the bones of the arm?, which showed no
breaks. Dr. Tynan once broke his riant
arm above the elbow, aud the pieces of
boue were never properly united, leaving
the arm slmost useless. Mrs. Tynan saw
the exposed bone which was buried here,
and is now satisfied that the murdered man
was nor her husband.
Another widow, whose husband disap
peared from Stockton three years «go, was
theie to see if the remains couid be identi
fied. She was the wife of Albert Polasky, a
dairyman, who left his home one evening
at 8 o'clock and has never been seeu siuce.
Measurement of tho bones showed that the
murdered luan was taller tl \n Polasky, so
the mystery is yet unsolved.
The pieces of the body had been in the
water, some say, M long .is a year. Most ol
the ilesh was off the bones, but stout shoes
were on the feet. From tlio appearance of
the bones of the arms an 1 hands, and the
ltinu", slender nails, it is believed the de
ceased was nUbei a delicate man and uot a
laborer, lie was about 5 f^et 9 inches tall,
and was roughly dressed.

SMITH'S NECK SAFE.
Neale Dissuades the Vigilance
Committee.
The A'iUrderer Owes His Life to the
flercy of His Victim's Father.
An Interview With Him.
special to The Morning Cai.u
San- Diego, Deo. s.— At the request of
George Neale JTather of the boy murdered
by Captain Sain Smith off the Coronada
Islands Friday, the vigilance committee has
abandoned or deferred the raid on the
Comity Jail, and it is not expected that any
attempt will be made to lynch the murderer
at present, if at all. The committee waited
upon .Neale upon hip return from San Fran
cisco, prepared to go at oice to the jail and
hang both Smith and Indian Joe, but at
NeaJe's solicitation no action was taken.
The jail is guarded by a few trusty men,
and the officers have excluded all who have
applied for admittance except a few friends
of the prisone-. Xewspaper men have
been denied entrance to the jail, but an in
terview with Smith was secured by stealth.
The murderer is broken down and wept
freely over the results of his acts, yet he
persists in saying that the boys were plot
ting against him. He would have made a
full confession if permitted, but tne inter
view shows a virttlal admission of his guilt,
though not male in direct language. He
expressed a wrlHingneaa to die when told of
the bitter feeling entertained against him
and the talk of lynching, but his mind re
peatedly reverted to the loss of his skiff,
concerning which he said: "Thoseawttil
boys. Those awful boys. They want in
ruin me. It would have been better if they
had never been born." He said he bad not
slept any for nine days after the loss of hi*
boat, but since his arrest has slept well,
though manifesting little appetite. An
eff.irt is being made to bolster up a itcry of
bis derangement, but his conversation it
lucid and intelligent.
