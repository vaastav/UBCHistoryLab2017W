The Currency Question, Hawaiian
Annexation and Other Que*
tions Discussed.
WASHINGTON, Deo. 6.—Following Is
the first annual message of President
McKinley to congress:
To the Senate and House of Representa
tive a:
It gives me pleasure to extend greeting
lo tlie Fifty-fourth oongreaa assembled at
the seat of government, with many of
whose senators and repnaentattvee I have
been associated In the legislative service.
Their meeting oocurs under felicitous
conditions, justifying sincere congratula
tion and calling for our grateful acknowl
edgment to a beneficent Providence whloh
has so stgnaUyblessed and prospered us
as a nation. Peace and good will with
all the nations of the earth continue un
broken.
ratrlotlim Now Above Partisanship.
A matter of genuine satisfaction la the
growing feeling of fraternal regard and
unification of all seotlons of our country,
the incompleteness of whloh has too long
delayed realization of the highest bless
ings of the Union. The spirit of patriot
ism Is universal and is ever Increasing In
fervor. The public questions which now
most engross us are lifted far above
either partisanship, prejudice or former
sectional differences. They affect every
port of our common country alike and
permit of no division on ancient llnea.
Questions of foreign polloy, of revenue,
the soundness of the currency, the inviola
bility of national obligations, the Im
provement of the public service, appeal to
the individual conscience of every earnest
citizen to whatever party he belongs or
in whatever section of the country he may
reside.
CURRENCY LEGISLATION.
Now tha Tariff I. Oat of the Way, That
Is of First Importanoe.
The extra session of this congress which
closed July last enacted important legis
lation, and, while its full effeot has not
yet been realized, what it has already ac
complished assures us of its timeliness and
wisdom. To test its value further time
will be required, and the people, satisfied
with its operation and results thus far,
aro in no mind to withhold from It a fair
trial.
Tariff legislation having been settled by
tho extra session of congress, the question
next pressing for consideration is that of
the currency.
Review of Paat Financial Operations.
The work of putting our finances upon a
sound basis, difficult as it may seem, will
appear easier when we recall the financial
operations of the government since 1866.
On the 80th day of June of that year we
had outstanding demand liabilities in the
sum of $7118,868,447.41. On the 1st of Jan
uary, 1870, these liabilities had been re
duced to (113,889,496.88. Of our interest
bearing obligations the figures are even
more striking. On July 1, 1866, the
principal of the interest bearing debt of
the government was $9,889,881,908. On
the 1st day of July, 1806, this sum had
beetireduoed to |S85,037,100, or an aggre
gate reduction of $1,747,894,108. The in
terest bearing debt of the United States
on the 1st day of Deoember, 1897, was
$847,9(0,690. The government money now
outstanding (Dec. 1) consists of $346,681,
016 of United States notes, $107,798,880 of
treasury notes issued by authority of the
law of 1890, $384,963,508 of silver certifi
cates and $61,330,731 of standard silver
dollars.
Ought Not to Hesitate.
With the great resources of the govern
ment and with the honorable example of
the past before us, we ought not to hesi
tate to enter upon a currency revision
which will make our demand obligations
less onerous to the government and re
lieve our financial laws from ambiguity
and doubt. The brief review of vthat was
accomplished from the close of the war to
1893 makes unreasonable and groundless
any distrust either of our financial abil
ity or soundness while the situation
from 1893 to 1897 must admonish congress
of the immediate necessity of so legislat
ing as to make the return of the condi
tions theq prevailing impossible.
A Correct Diagnosis tlio Tint Thing.
There'are many plans proposed as a
remedy for the evil. Before we can find
the true remedy we must appreciate the
real evil. It is not that our currency of
every kind is not good, for every dollar of
it is good good because the governnent's
pledge is out to keep it so, and that pledge
will not be broken. However, the guar
anty of our purpose to keep the pledge
will be best shown by advancing toward
Its fulfillment.
The evil of the present system la found
In the great cost the government of
maintaining the parity of our different
forms of moneyr. that is, keeping aU of
them at par with gold. We surely can
qpt be longer heedless of the burden this
imposes upon the people evep under
fairly prosperous conditions, witile the
past foui years have demonstrated that it
is not only an expensive charge upon the
•govpnwent but a dangerous menace to
ibe national credit
Carta!! VbligaUoa or laerease Reserve.
It Is manifest that we must devise same
plon to protect the government against
bond issues for repeated redemptions. We
must either curtail the opportunity for
speculation, made easy by the multiplied
redemptions of our demam} obligatipqs,

VOL. XV DICKINSON STARK PP., NORTH DAKOTA, SATUftflAY, DEC. \h 1897
government la obliged to keep equal with
gold all Its outstanding currency and oaln
ohltgatlnrs. Whlle Ita receipts are not re
quired to be paid-in gold. They an paid
In every kind of money but gold, and the
inly means by which the government can
with certainty get gold is by borrowing.
It can get It In no other way when it most
needs it. The government without any
fixed gold revenue pledged to maintain
Rpld redemption,
whlofclt Us etssrtlly and
fUthfully done, and which under the
authority now given It will oontinue
to do.
The law which requires the govern
ment, after having redeemed its United
Ststes notes, to pay them .out again as
rarrent funds demands a eonstant re
plenishment of the gold reserve. This is
(specially so In times, of business panic
and when the revenues an Insufficient
to meet the expenses of this government.
At such times the government has no
ether way to supply its deficit and main
tain redemption but through the increase
of its bonded debt as during the adminis
tration ot my predecessor when $862,815,
M0 of 4K per cent bonds wen issued and
sold and the prooeeds used to pay the ex
pense ot the government in excess of the
revenues and auataln the gold reserve.
WhiMi it is true that the greater part of
the proceeds of these bonds were used to
supply deficient revenues,* considerable
portion was required to maintain the gold
reserve.
Should Have Aetfcorttjr to Ml Beads.
With our revenues equal to our expen
ses, there would be no deficit requiring
the issuance of bonds. But if the gold
reserve falls below $100,000,000 how will
It be replenished except by selling more
bonds? Is there any other way practica
ble under existing law? The serious
question then is, shall we oontinue the
policy that has been pursued In the past
that is, when the gold reserve reaches the
point of danger, issuo more bonds and
supply the needed gold, or shall we pro
vide other means to prevent these re
curring drains upon the gold reserve? If
no furthar legislation is had and the pol
icy of selling bonds is to be continued,
then congress should give the secretary of
the treasury authority to sell bonds at
long or short periods, bearing a less rate
of interest than is now authorised by law.
No Reissue of Notee Except For Gold.
I earnestly reoommend, as soon as tho
receipts of the government are quite suf
ficient to pay all the expenses of the gov
ernment, that when any of the United
States notes an presented for redemption
In gold and an redoemed In gold, such
notes shall be kept and set apart, and
only paid out in exchange for gold. This
is an obvious duty. If the holder of
United States notes prefers the gold and
gets it from the government, ho should
not receive baok from the government a
United States note without paying gold
in exchange for it. The reason for this
is made all the more apparent when the
government issues an Interest bearing
debt to provide gold for the redemption
of United States notes—a non-Interest
bearing debt. Surely it should not pay
them out again, except on demand for
gold. If they an put out In any other
way they may return again to be followed
by another bond issue to redeem them—
another interest bearing debt to redeem a
non-interest bearing debt.
Government the Only Sufferer.
In my view it is of the utmost impor
tance that the government should be re
lieved from the burden of providing all
the gold required for exchanges and ex
port. This responsibility Is alone borne
by the government without any of tho
usual and necessary banking powers to
help Itself. The banks do not feel the
strain of gold redemption. The whole
strain rests upon the government and the
size of the gold reserve in the treasury has
come to be, with or without reason, the
signal of danger or of security. This
ought to be stopped.
If we an to have an era of prosperity in
the country with sufficient receipts for
the expenses of the government we may
feel no immediate embarrassment from
our present currenoy but the danger still
exists and will be ever present menacing
us so long as the existing system con
tinues. And besides, It is in times of ade
quate revenues and business tranquility
that the government should prepare for
tto worst. We cannot avoid without
serious conaequencea the wise considera
tion and prompt solution of this question.
Calls Attention to Hr. Gage's Plan.
The secretary of the treasury has out
lined a plan in great detail for the purpose
of removing the threatened recurrence of
a depleted gold reserve and save us from
future embarrassment on that aooount.
To this plan I Invite your careful consid
eration.
I concur with the secretary of the treas
ury in his recommendation that national
banks be allowed to issue notes to the
face value of tho bonds which they have
deposited for circulation and that tax on
circulating notes ..scoured by deposit of
such bonds be reduced to one-half of 1
.per cent per annum. I also join him
in recommending that authority be
given for the establishment of national
banks With a minimum capital of $85,000.
Thia will enable the smaller villages! And1
agricultural regions of the country tb be
supplied with currenoy to meet their
needs.
I recommend that the issue of national
bank notes be restricted to the denomina
tion of $10 and upwards. If the sugges
tions I have herein made Shall have the
approval of congress then I would recom
mend that national banks be required to
redeem the notes In gold.
THE CUBAN QUESTION.
|t Is the Most Important of Asy Per.
talalag to Foreign Bolatloua.
The most important problem with which
this government is now called upon to
deal pertaining to its foreign relations
concerns its duty toward Spain and the
Cuban insurrection. Problems and condi
tions more or less in common with those
now existing have confronted this govern
ment at various times in the past. The
story of Cuba for many years has been one
of unrest and growing, discontent an ef
fort toward a. larger enjoyment of liberty
and wlf-cointroli of organized resistance
to the mother country of depression after
distress and warfare and of ineffectual
settlement, to be followed by renewed re
volt. For no enduring period since the
enfranchisement of the continental pos
sessions of Spain in the western continent
has the condition of Cuba or the policy of
Spain toward Cuba not caused friction
concerning the United States.
The prospect from time to time that the
weakness' of Spain's hold upon the Island
and the political vicissitudes and embar
rassments of the home government migb'
lead to the transfer of Cuba to a conti
nental power, called forth,. between 1828
and 1880Various emphatic declarations of
the policy of the United States to permi^
ao disturbance of Cuba's conneetion with
(Spain unless in ti)e direction of independ''
one* or acquisition by the United States
thrwigh purchase nor has thsre been
any change of this: declared-ponby since
upon thepartofthegovernjnenfe.
The Ton Years' War.
The revolution, which began in 1868,
lasted for ten years, despite the stren
uous efforts of the sucoesslve peninsular
governments to suppress It. Then, 09
now, the gqvdvmifintot tyq United Sfct^i
tgttifiW'lfli grtat oqncqrn au4 qffwad its
aid to pqt an end to bloodshed in Cuba.
The overtures made by Qenneral Qrant
wen refused, and the war dragged on,
entailing great loss of lift and treasure
and increased injury to American inter
ests, besides throwing enhanced burdens
of neutrality on tho government. In 1878
iSL
jfc WSS^'-dS&iW-
peace was brought about by the truce ot
Zanjon, obtained by negotiations be
tween the Spanish commander, Martlnex
da Campos, Md the Insurgent leaders.
The Proseat Insurrection.
The present insurrection broke out In
February, 1895.: It is not my purpose at
this time to cecall its remarkable Increase
or to charactMrUe its tenaoloua resistance
to the eaonityha foreign army enmassefl
•gainst It by-Spain. The revolt and the
efforts to subdue It carried destruction to
every quartet of the island, developing
wide proportions and defying the efforts
of Spain for Its suppression. The civilized
oode of war has been disregarded, no less
so by the SpUllards than by the Cubans.
The existing conditions cannot but fill
this government and the American people
with gravest Apprehension. There is no
desire on the part of our people to profit
by the misfortunes of Spain. We have
only the desire to see the Cubans prosper
ous and contented, enjoying that measure
of self-control Which is the inalienable
right of man protected In their right to
reap the benefits of the exhaustless treas
ures of their country.
The offer1 made by my predecessor in
April, 1896, tMidering the friendly offices
of this goveriiment failed. Any mediation
on our part waif) not acoepted. In brief,
the answer v^is:- "There is no effectual
way to paclty.Cuba unless It begins with
the actual submission of the rebels to the
mother counnyi"
Then only could Spain aot in the prem
ised direction of )ter own motion and after
her own plan.
The Cruel Polloy of Concentration.
The oruel policy of concentration was
initiated Feb. 16,1896. The districts con
trolled by theSpanish armies were de
populated. The agricultural Inhabitants
were herded in and about the garrison
towns, their lands laid waste and their
dwellings destroyed This policy the late
cabinet of Spain justified as a necessary
measure of war and as a means of cutting
off supplies from the insurgents. It has
utterly failed as a war measure. It was
not civilized warfare. It was extermina
tion.
Has ttepeatedly Protested.
Against this abuse of rights of war I
have felt constrained on repeated occa
sions to enter the firm and earnest pro
test of this government. Thero was much
of public condemnation of the treatment
of American cltizena by aUeged illegal
arrests and long imprisonment awaiting
trial or pending protracted judicial pro
ceedings. I folt it my first duty to make
lnstand demand for the release or speedy
trial of all Atnerlcan citizens under ar
rest. Befow the change of the Spanish
cabinet in Qetober last, 98 prisoners,
citizens of tho United States, had 'been
given their ftnedom. For the relief -of our
own citlzene,'j(uffering because of thii con
flict, the aldt^ oongress was sought In a
speMlineaMk£e, and under tho approprlo
tlonrof 'Apitt 4,1897, effective aid has been
glvan to American citizens In Cuba, many
of them at their own request having been
returned to tho United States.
Minister .Woodford's Instructions.
Tho Instructions given to our new mtn
lster to Spain before his departure for his
post directed him to impress it upon that
government the sincere wish of the Unit
ed States to lend Its aid toward the end
ing of the wur in Cuba by reaching a
peaceful and lasting result, just and hon
orable alike Spain and the Cuban peo
ple. These instructions recited the char
acter and duration of the contest, the
widespread losses it entails, the burdens
and restraints it Imposes upon us, with
constant disturbance of national interests
and the injury resulting from an Indefinite
continuance of this state of things. It
was stated that at this juncture our
government, was constrained to strenu
ously inquire if tho time was not ripe
when Spain, -of her own volition, moved
by her own interests and every sentiment
of humanity,' should put a stop to this de
structive war. and make proposals of set
tlement honorable to herself and just to
her Cuban colony. It was urged that a
neighboring nation with large Interests
In Cuba coul^l'be required to wait only a
reasonable tiinefor the mother,country to
establish its authority and restore order
within the borders of the island that we
could not contemplate as indefinite period
for the accomplishment ot this result.
No Humiliation In the Proposal.
No solution'was proposed to which tho
slightest Idea of humiliation to Spain
eould attach, and, Indeed, precise pro
posals were Withheld to avoid embarrass
ment to that,government. All that was
asked or expected was that some safe way
might be speedily provided and perma
nent peace restored. It so chanced that
the consideration of this offer addressed
to the samo Spanish administration which
had declined .the tenders of my predecessor
and which for, more than two years had
poured men! and treasure into Cuba In
the fruitless effort to suppress the
revolt, fell to others. Between

new envoy, and his arrival In Spain, the

In the Direction of Better Understanding.
Uon under tho leadership
The reply 4Ur note was received on
the 93d of OdVoht/r. It is in the dlreotlon
of a better ulUfeiistandlng. It appreciates
the friendly proposals of this government.
It admits that our country is deeply at
feeted by thewar in Cuba and that its de
sire for peace.ls just It declares that the
present Spanish government is bound by
every consideration to a chunge of policy
that should qstisfy the United States and
paolfy Cuba^withln a reasonable time. To
this end SpiAU has decided to put into
effect the polfttoal reforms heretofore ad
vocated by this present premier, without
halting for any consideration In the path
which in lts jltdgmont leads to peace. The
military preparations will continue, it is
said, but will. j»',humane, and be conduct
ed with all r^jjaird for private rights, being
accompanied ,by political action leading to
the autonomy, of Cuba while guarding
Spanish sovsjMlgnty.
In the absems of a declaration|of the
measures that this government proposes
to take in carrying out its proffer of good
offices, it suggests that Spain be left free
to conduct mUltiiry operations and grant
political reforms, while the United States
for its part shall enforce Its neutral obli
gations and-cut off the assistance which,
it is asserted, the insurgents reoelve from
this country,.V The supposition of an in
definite prolongation of the war is de
nied.

Three Untried Heasnroe 'Yet Wimala
Of tho untried measures there remain
only: Bocognltion of the insurgents as
belligennts, recognition of the Independ
ence of Cuba neutral intervention to end
the war by imposing a rational compro
mise between the contestants and inter
vention in favor of one or the other party.
I speak not of forcible annexation, for
that cannot be thought of. That by our
oode of morality would be criminal ag
gression.
The Qoaatloa of BeUlgereaey.
Bocognltion of the belligerency of tho
Cuban insurgents has often bwn can
vassed as a possible It not Inevitable stop
both in regard to tho previous 10 yean':
struggle and during the present war., I
am not unmindful that the two houses of
congress In the spring of 1896 expressed
the opinion by conciirnnt resolution that
a oondltlon of publio war existed requir
ing or justifying the recognition ot the
state of belligerency In Cuba and during
the extra session the senate voted a joint
resolution of like Import, which, how-'
ever, was not bnught to a vote in the
house of the representatives. In the
presence of these significant expressions
of the legislative branoh it behooves
tho exeoutive to soberly consider
the conditions under which so
important a measure must need rest for
justification. It is to be seriously consid
ered whether the Cuban Insurrection pos
sesses beyond dispute the attributes of
statehood, whloh alone can demand the
recognition of belligerency in its favor.
Possession, in short, of the essential qual
ifications of sovereignty by the insurgents,
and the conduct of the war by them ac
cording to the reserved code of war are
no less important factors toward the de
termination of belligerency than are the
Influences and consequences of the strug
gle upon tho International polloy of the
reoognizlng state.
Recalls Grant's Utterances.
The utterances of President Qrant in his
memorablo message of Deo. 7, 1879, are
signally relevant to tho present situation
in Cuba, and it may be wholesome now to
recall thom. The conditions were the
samo then as now except that the war had
been longer continued and the devastation
evon greater. The conclusions of Presi
dent Qrant were at that time, however,
against recognition of belligerency, be
cause he did not bollovo it In fact existed,
as belligerency Is Understood by the law of
nations.
Practical As pent* ot Recognition.
Turning to tho practical aspects ot a
recognition of belligerency and reviewing
its inconveniences and positive dangers,
still further pertinent considerations
appear. In tho oode of nations then Is
no such thing as a naked recognition ot
belligerency unaocompanied by the as
sumption of international neutrality.
Such recognition without more will not
confer upon either party to the domestio
conflict a status not theretofore actually
possessed, or affeot the relation of either
party to other states. The 'aot of recogni
tion usually takes the form of a solemn
proclamation of neutrality whloh reoites
tho do facto condition of belligerency as
its motive. It announces a domestio law
on neutrality in declaring state. It as
sumes international obligations of a neu
tral in the presence of a publio state of war.
It warns all oitlzens and others within
tho jurisdiction of tho proolalmant
that they violate those righteous obliga
tions at their own peril and cannot expect
to be shielded from the consequences.
The right of visit and soareh on the seas
and seizure of vessels and cargoes and
contraband of war and good prize uiider
admiralty law must under International
law be admitted as a legitimate conse
quence of a proclamation of belllgerenoy.
While according the equal belligerent
rights defined by publio law to eaoh party
in our ports disfavors would be Imposed
on both which, while nominally equal
would weigh heavily in behalf of Spain
herself.
Would Be Bad for Cuba.
Possessing a navy and controlling the
ports of Cuba her maritime rights could
bo asserted not only for the military In
vestment of the Island' but up to the man,
gin of our own territorial waters and a
condition of things would exist for whloh
tho Cubans within their oWAi doniMn
could not hope to create a' paSejjU^if Wjtdte
its creation through aid or sympathy'froto
within our domain would be even more
impossible than now with the additional
obligations of international neutrality
we would perforce assume
The enforcement of this enlarged and
onerous code of neutrality would only be
influential within our own jurisdiction
by land and sea and applicable by our
own Instrumentalities. It could impart
to tho United States no jurisdiction be
tween Spain and the insurgents. It would
give the United States no right of inter
vention to enforeo tho conduct of the
strife within the paramount authority of
Spain according to tho international code
of war. For thew reasons I regard the
recognition of the belligerency of the Cu
ban Insurgents as now unwise and there
fore inadmissabla Should that step here
after be deemed wise as a measure of
right and duty Me executive will take tfc

had been frequently suggested and has
not failed to receive my most anxious and
earnest consideration. But should su6h a
step be now taken when It Is apparent
that a hopeful change has supervened in

ANNEXATION OF HAWAII.
Ratification of the Treaty Negotiated Is
Considered Desirable.
By a speoial message dated the 16th day
of June last I laid before the sonate a
treaty signed that day by the plenipoten
tiaries of the United States and of tho
npubllo of Hawaii having for its purpose
the incorporation of the Hawaiian isl
ands as an integral part of the United
States and under ita sovenlgnty.
While consistently disavowing fnm a
very early period any aggressive polloy
of absorption in regard to the Hawaiian
group, a long series of declarations
through throo-quarters of a century has
proclaimed the vital Interest of the United
States, in the independent life of the isl
ands and their intimate commercial de
pendency upon this country. At the same
time It has been repeatedly asserted that
In no event oould the entity of Hawaiian
statehood cease by their passage un
der the dominion or Influence of an
other power than the United States. Un
der these clrcumstanoes the logic of events
required that annexation, heretofore of
fered but declined, should In the ripeness
of time come about as the natural result
of tho strengthening tho ties that bind us
to those Islands and be realized by the
free will of the Hawaiian state.
That treaty was unanimously ratified
without amendment by the senate and
president of the republic of Hawaii on tho
10th of September last, and only awaits
the favorable aotion of the American sen
ate to effect Mie complete absorption of
the Islands into the domain of tho United
States. What the conditions of suoh a
union shall be, tho political relation
thereof to the United States, the charaoter
of the looal administration, the quality
and degree of tho elective franchise of
the inhabitants, the extension of tho fed
eral laws to the territory, the enaotment
of special laws to fit tho pecullaroondltlon
thereof, the regulation if need bo of the
labor system therein, are all matters
whloh tho treaty has wisely relegated to
congress.
THE MONETARY COMMISSION.
Work of Melirs. Woloott, Stevenson and
Paine Reviewed.
Under the provisions of the aot of con
gress approved March 8,1897, for the pro
motion of International agreement re
specting bimetallism, I appointed on the
14th day of April, 1897, Hon. Edward O.
Woloott of Colorado, Hon. Adlal E.
Stevenson of Illinois and Hon. Charles J.
Paine of Massachusetts as speoial envoys
to represent the United States. They
have been diligent in their efforts to se
cure the corporation of European coun
tries in the International settlement of the
question, but up to this time have not
been able to secure an agreement oontem
plaitod by their iniiMlon.
The gratifying action of our great sister
republio of France in joining this ooun
try in the attempt to bring about an
agreement among the principal commer
cial nations of Europe whereby a fixed
and relative valuo between gold and sil
ver shall be secured, furnishes assur
ances that we are not alone among tho
larger nations of the world in realizing
the international oharacter of the prob
lem and in the desire of reaohlng some
wise and praotlcal solution of it. Tho
British government published a resumo
of the steps taken jointly by tho French
ambassador in London and tho
special envoys of the United States,
to whom our ambassador at London
aotlvely co-operated in the presentation
of this subject to her majesty's govern
ment. This will be laid before congress.
Our special envoys havo not made their
final report, as further negotiations be
tween the representatives of this govern
ment and tho governments of other coun
tries are pending and in contemplation.
They bellevMthat doubts which have been
raised In certain quarters respecting the
possibility of maintaining the stability of
the parity between the metals and kin
dred questions may yet be solved by fur
ther negotiations.
Meanwhile it gives me satisfaction to
state that the special envoys have already
demonstrated their ability and fitness to
deal with the subject, and it Is to be hoped
that their labors may result in an inter
national agreement whloh wlU bring
about recognition of both gold and silver
as money upon such terms and with suoh
safeguards as will secure the use of both
metals upon a basis which shall work no
Injury to any class of our citizens.

the failure so far of the Dawes ooxnmls
slon to socuro the consent of tha tribes to
an extinguishment of the tribal titles and
a division of tho lands. It Is said that
should the tribes still fail to ratify ths
agreement then some legislation should
be had by congress.
Kansas Paolflo Bale.
Speaking of the pending sale ot ths
Kansas Paolflo railroad it is said that it
no better bid Is received than tho upset
price fixed by the court the government
would receive only $8,800,000 on Its olalm
of nearly $18,000,000. He believes that
the government has tho authority to bid
on the road and has directed the secretary
of the treasury to make tho deposit of
$900,000 required to quality as a hlddsf
and to bid at the sale a sum at least sonu
to the principal of the debt to tho govern
ment. He suggests, however, that In a
matter so Important as the government
becoming a possible owner of the railroad,
congress should enact some legislation to
define its views. It is dear to him, how
ever, that the government should not
permit the property to be sold at a prioe
less than one-half the prinolpal of its
debt and less than one-fifth of Its entire
debt, prinolpal and interest.
The Civil Sarvloe.
The president devotes tho last ohaptsr
of his message to the olvll servloo, the
practical Improvement of which, ho says,
has long been a subjeot of earnest dlsous
slon, and whloh has of late years reoeived
increasod legislative and exeoutive ap
proval. During the past few months the
service has been placed upon a still firmer
basis of business methods and personal
merit. While the right of deserving vet
eran soldiers to reinstatement has been
asserted, dismissals for merely political
reasons havo been carefully guarded
against tho examinations Improved and
mado practical, and a distinct advanoo
has been made by giving a hearing before
dismissal upon all cases when incompe
tency is charged or demand made for the
removal of offloials. This last has been
done without impairing the power of re
moval, one of the vital safeguards of the
system. Much remains to be done before
the system can be perfected, and the pres
ident says that ho shall not hesitate to
exempt cases which he thinks havo been
properly included in the classified service
or include those whloh In hit judgment
will best promote the publio servioe. The
system has the approval ot the people and
It will be his endeavor to uphold and ax
tend it.
Department Report*.
Concluding the message, the president'
says:
I am forced by the length of this ao*
sage to omit many Important reference*
to affairs of the government with whloh
congress will have to deal at the present
session. They are fully disoussed In the
departmental reports, to all of which I in
vite your earnest attention.
The estimates of the expense of the
government by the several departments
will, I am sure, have your careful
sorutiny. While the congress may
not find it an easy talk to re
duce tho expense of the government,
it should not enoourage their increase.
These expenses wlU, in my judgment, ad
mit of a decrease in many branohes of the
government without Injury to the public
servlco. It is a commanding duty to keep
the appropriations within the receipts of
the government and thus avoid a deficit.
