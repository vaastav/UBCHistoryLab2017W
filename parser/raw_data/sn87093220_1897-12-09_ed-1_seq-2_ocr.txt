his annual report to Secretary Gage. It
shows that during the fiscal year ended
June 30, 18'J7, the total number of
patients treated at hospitals and the
dispensaties connected with the service

controller of the currency, for the ye ir
ended October 31, 1897, opens with a
brief resume of the history of the legis

Further information from Washing
ton respecting the propose) 1 canal ami
locks for the channel at the dalles is to
the effect that it is proposal to push
the work with a ileal of rapidity. The
contract system and modem metlm Is of
excavation ami building have made it
clear that .years need not be spent upon
a work of this character. If the ion
tract for improving the Columbia by a
small channel at the dalles is adopted
it will no doubt be stipulated that the
work must be done with rapidity.
A terrible railroad accident has oc

The receipts of the customs so far
this fiscal year undoubtedly will fall
considerably short of estimates made
by the managers of the new tariff bill
during its pendency in congress. At
that time it was estimated that the
customs would yield about $1 50,000,-
000 during the lirst year. The indica
tions are now said to be that the re
ceipts from this source will not aggre
gate more than $105,000,000.

low velocity. Neither penetrated nor
cracked the plate, but botli partially
welded themselves into it.
Word comes of a wreck on the Santa
Fee near Williams, Ariz., in which
three men lost their lives and much
valuable property was destroyed.
After tlie first section of freight train
No. 33 had pulled out of Williams the
air that controls the brakes gave out
and the train dashed down the steep
grade with rapidly increasing velocity.
The hand brakes were unavailing to
check the speed, and when a point
about 10 miles west was reached the
train left the track. Two engines were
coupled to tiie train, which was a very
heavy one. Engineers Newton and
Watsons and Fireman Berry were pin
ned under their respective engines and
lost their lives, it is said, by being
burned to death.
Emperor William opened the session
of the German reichstag in person for
the first time since 1894. The cere
mony took place in White hall, in the
royal castle. His majesty read the
speech from the throne.
The steamer San Bias has arrived in
San Francisco from Panama and way
ports. She brings the news that the
Salvador coffee crop f>>r this season
will be one-third larger than ever be

The London papers assert that China
lias practically agreed to cede Kngland
a strip of territory near Hong Kong,
and all the surrounding islands in or
der to enable England to fortify them
securely and to increase the garrison.
Secretary Gage is quoted as saying
that in the annual estimate he would
send to congress he would name about
$30,01>0,000, and not above $25,000,-
000, as the amount of the treasury de
licit for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1898. The secretary said he expected
the receipts from customs to increase
steadily, and in tiie spting months lie
anticipated quite large importations.
AGAIN IN SESSION.
First Regular Meeting of the Fifty-Fifth
Congress.
At noon Monday the first regular ses
sion of the 55th congress was launched
upon the unknown seas of legislation.
Simultaneously at both ends of the Cap
itol, Speaker Keed in the house and
Vice-President Hohart in the senate,
dropped their gavels and called to or
der the bodies over which they preside.
The sun shone brightly from a cloudless
skv, making a glorious bright Decem
ber day, with a tine of frost in the air,
and a breeze just strong enough to keep
the stars and stripes snapping from
the fiagstaffs.
At the capitol crowds swarmed into
the corridors at an early hour and
choked the marine steps as they ascend
ed to the galleries from which they
were to view the show. As is usual on
such occasions, the reserved galleries
were carefully guarded, admission be
ing only by card, and the public hail
great difficulty wedging itself into the
limited space set aside foi it.
In the I'pner House.
The senate chamber at the opening
session was a veritable conservatory.
The floral display was beautiful. Pre
cisely at 12 o'clock the gavel of Vice-
President Hohart fell, and the senate
was called to order. An invocation
was delivered by Kev. Milburn, the
blind chaplain. Seventy-seven senators
responded on roll-call.
The venerable Mr. Morrill, of Ver
mont. was first recognized by the vice
president. He offered a resolution,
which was passed, in the usual form,
that the secretary inform the house
that the senate was in session and
ready to proceed to business.
Allison of lowa presented a resolu
tion that a committee of two senators
be appointed to join a like committee
from the house to inform the president
that congress was in session, and pre
pared to receive any communication lie
might desire to make. The resolution
was passed, and the vice-president
named Allison and Gorman as a senate
committee.
By resolution of Cullom of Illinois,
the time of the daily meetings of the
senate was fixed at noon. On motion
of Halo of Maine, a recess was then
taken until 1 o'clock.
At 1:30 the senate reassembled and
the committee, headed by Gorman, re
ported. The president's message was
presented by Mr. Pruden at 1:30
o'clock, and was laid before the senate
and read.
In the Lower House.
The house of representatives present
ed an animated appearance long before
noon. The surrounding corridors were
tilled with jostling, moving crowds be
fore 11 o'clock. The galleries which
overlook the tioor were black with peo
ple. Floral tribute?for members were
numerous, and in some instances im
posing.
As the hands of the clock pointed to
12 Speaker Heed, attired in a black
cutaway coat, and wearing a red tie,
ascended the rostrum. The crack of
the gavel subdued the din on the floor
and conversation in the galleries. In
the deep silence which followed the
calling of the assemblage to order,
prayer was offered by the eminent
divine, Rev. Chalres A. Boney, of
Kngland, who delivered an invocation
solemn and impressive.
The speaKer then directed the clerk
to call the roll. The roll call showed
the presence of 801 members. There
were 55 vacancies from death or resig
nation during the recess, and the cre
dentials of the members-elect were read
by direction of the speaker, who then
administered the oath of office to them.
On motion of Dingley a resolution was
adopted for the appointment of a com
mittee of three to join the senate com
mittee to wait upon the president ami
inform liiin that congress was ready to
receive any communication he desired
to make. The speaker named Dingley,
Grosvenor and liailey for this honor.
On motion of Henderson of lowa daily
sessions to begin at noon each day were
ordered. The house then took a short
recess.
When the house reassembled the
committee appointed to wait upon the
president reported, having perfected its
mission. Mr. Prnden, who had ' fol
lowed the committee into the hall, im
mediately presented the message, which,
by direction of the speaker, was read at
the clerk's desk.
A|i|>r»pi'inU<iim Itecoiiiinemled,
Secretary Gage Monday transmitted
to congress estimates of the appropria
tions required for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1809, as furnished by several
executive departments. The total
amount called for in the estimates is
$402,047,885, which is about $32,000,-
000 in excess of the appropriations for
1898, including deficiencies and miscel
laneous expenses, and about $41,000,-
000 more than was estimated for 1898.
Under the head of public works the
treasury department,among other items,

BRINK OF A CIVIL WAR
Austria and Hungary Appar
ently Drifting Apart.
CZECHS PROPOSE TRIPLE EMPIRE
Faction* Drawing I'p for a Cireat Strug
gle—Can the Em porer Bring
Order Out of Cham?
London, Dec. 7. —International ques
tions have been temporarily over
shadowed by the gravity of the situa
tion in Austria, where things are as
gloomy as imaginable. In addition to
the imminence of a civil war, the noxt
few hours may possibly witness a revo
lution in the relations between Austria
1 ami Hungary, which might mean the
| reconstruct ion of the map of Europe.
It is hardly an exaggeration to say that
the factions are drawing up like con
tending armies. The Germans have
appealed to their compatriots on botli
sides of the frontier, and have appar
ently prepared to run all risks to keep
' the hated Czechs in subjection. The
Czechs make no secret of the fact that
their final aim is to abolish the dual
empire, and to make it a triple empire
■ by placing Bohemia on an equal footing
with Austria and Hungary. To grant
these demands would set Hungary on
lire and destroy the foundation of the
present imperial system. It looks as
though the employment of force is the
only solution of the question, but
against which faction will it be used?
The question of the provisional aus
i;lich bill (or agreement to prolong for
it year, instead of 10 years, the compact
between Austria and Hungary, pending
arrangements for a longer compact), is,
if possible, more grave than the threat
ened civil war. The Hungarian diet
lias given Baron von Gautsche von
Prankenthurn, the Austrian premier,
till .Monday next in which to state
whether he can reasonably expect the
ausglieh bill to pass, and, failing a de
cisive answer, Baron Banffy, the Hun
garian premier, will introduce Monday
a bill whereby Hungary will act inde
pendently as regards the duties to be
levied, continuance of commercial rela
tions with Austria and the charter of
the Austro-Hungarian bank. This
compact between the two portions of
the dual state may be maintained tem
porarily. Hungary will establish her
claim to the right of independently
disposing of these questions.
It is easy to see that victory will only
whet the Hungarian appetite, and that
it will be a short step to the dissolution
of Austria, which, in turn, will hurl
Europe into a furnace 'tf terrible possi
bilities.
Apparently the only hope of escape
is that the personal ascendancy of the
old emperor will once again enable him
to solve an apparently impossible situ
ation. Failing in this, the reichsrath
will be dissolved and a reign of abso
lutism will begin in Austria, and, tech
nically. Hungary will have resumed
her independence, the first step toward
a federation, as distinguished from a
dual Austro-Hungarian monarchy.
Itlothig }n llolivinla.
Prague, Dec. 7. —At Taber last night
Czechs attacked the houses of Hebrews
and broke the windows of a synagogue.
Several rioteis wore arrested. The
local force of gendarmes were called
upon to assist in restoring order. A
mob of over 1,000 persons at Brannau
last evening attacked the houses of
Czechs, and in spite of the efforts of
the gendarmes smashed the windows
and did other damage, tjuiet was not
restored until midnight. In Prague
the military patiol was tired upon, but
none of the patrol was wounded.

Further I'nrticulurs of the Disaster in
the ritilippines.
Seattle, Dec. 7. —The steamer Kago
shima Mam arrived here today, 1(>
days from Yokohama, bringing Orien
tal advices up to November 19. The
following additional particulars have
been received of ihe terrible typhoon
which swept over the Philippin,

tive victims is put at from 400 to 500.
The typhoon seems to have done its
worst damage at Tacloban, the capital
of Leyte, where the whole town was
converted into a mass of ruins. The
bodies of 120 Europeans were recov
ered. Tiie government house, treas
ury, barracks, etc., were destroyed.
The coast is strewn with the wreckage
of vessels torn to pieces by the litirri

on the track of the Northern Pacific,
one mile south. The body was mangled
beyond recognition. The man was 5
feet 8 inches, dresesed in a blue checked
sack coat and brown overcoat.

that the man came to his death by hav
ing his throat cut, but whether by his
own hand or the hand of another they
could not say. A bloody knife, a bloody

the pocket, but not a scrap of paper
that would lead to the identity of the
man could bo found. The body was
thrown on the track to conceal the
crime.

DR. WYMAN'S report.
Danger of the Importation of A»«»«e
Cholera.
Washington, Dec. 7.—Surgeon-Gen
eral Wyman, of the marine hospital
service, has submitted his annual re
port to Secretary Gage. It shows thai
during the fiscal year ended June 30,
1897, the total number of patients
treated at hospitals and the dispensaries
connectetd with the service was 54,477.
Although the total number of patients
treated was 873 in excess of those treat
ed during the previous fiscal year, the
expenditures were $538,536, which it
121,000 less than the previous year
The number of immigrants inspectec
by officers of the service at the variou
ports aggregated 232.327. lhe surgeon
general says:
"The necessity of legislation to secure
proper shelter for deck crews on \\ est
ern waters, to which my attention was
called in the last report, was met by the
act of congress requiring every steam
boat upon the Mississippi river and its
tributaries to furnish a place for the
crew with protection from the weather.
This subject is one that has long en
gaged the attention of the marine hos
pital surgeons, who have made frequent
reports thereon, and this action of con
gress will be productive of much relief,
although the act does not take effect
until June 30, 181)8. To meet the
growing demands for the service, new
regulations have been prepared, and
will shortly be issued."
The surgeon-general invites attention
to the excellent work by officers of the
corps during the recent visitation of yel
low fever in the South. Officers were
assigned to infected districts, and, al
though a number of them were not im
mune to yellow fever, neverthele-s they
responded with alacrity and performed
their duties with judgment and effi
ciency. Three officers contracted yellow
fever and one lost his life by accident
in the line of duty.
TROLLEY CARS COLLIDED.
Three Pcr»on* Killed and a Score In
jured Near Detroit.
Detroit, Dec. 7. —Two suburban cars,
carrying some 20 passengers, and both
running at a speed of 25 miles an hour,
collided on the Detroit & Oakland elec
tric railroad, at 1 o'clock this afternoon.
Three men were instantly killed and a
score of persons injured, several of them
seriously. The dead are:
John Savage, superintendent of the
road; Charles M. Whitehead, motor
man; John Kelly, of Detroit, book
agent. A dozen others were more or
less seriously injured.
The exact cause of the accident is not ,
yet known. According to the schedule,
a car leaves Detroit and Pontiac every
hour, and there are three sidings along
the road. Today the cars were behind
time. Tho one bound southward for
Detroit had passed an outbound car at
a switch two miles from Pontiac, the
crew apparently being ignorant of the
fact that another outbound car was ap
proaching them less than two miles
away. The weather, was foggy and the
rails slippery from sleet. The collision
occurred near a gravel pit half way be
tween Pontiac and Birmingliay, at the
foot of two steep grades, down which
>■ jars ran at full speed. The cars
..ere driven half through each other,
and were crushed to pieces.
Had it not been for the stout con
struction of the cars, both of which
were new, it is doubtful whether unv of
the occupants would have escaped alive.
As it was, nearly all of the 14 passen
gers in the southbound car suffered
some injury. Some of the injured were
taken to farmers' lions s, others were
brought to city hospitals.
The Matter Arctiiigcd.
Washington, Doe. 7. —It was official
ly announced at the White House today,
on the return of the president to Wash

New Jersey, has been tendered and has
accepted the office of attorney-general
of the United States, which will be
vacated hy the nomination of Attorney-
General McKenna to be associate jus
tice of the United States supreme court.
It has not yet been settled when Gov
ernor Griggs shall assume his new
office, but it is probable that the date
will be about the beginning of the new
year.

Indiana Will Have to Taj-.
Denver, Dec. 7.—The Indians who
participated in the recent troubles in
the western part of the state are very ;
likely to get into trouble with federal
authorities over the killing of stock '
belonging to ranchers in and around '
Rio Blanco county. According to '
their own statements the Indians killed '
stock belonging to the ranchers for the '
purpose of procuring their hides for !
tanning. If the authorities can a>cer- !
tain to whom these cattle belong and '
can prove which Indians killed them,
the latter will have to reimburse the s

c
GENERAL PANDO SHOT
Spaniards Discredit It in the
Absense of Proofs.
SPANISH DEFEAT AT MATANZAS
Santa Clara the Reported Scone of Tan.
du'a I.aat FlgHt-Hinallpo»
In San Domingo.
New York, Due. 6.—A Herald «li«-
patch from Havana says: A report
that General Pando, who was placed in
charge of military operations in Cuba
by General Blanco, lias been killed in
an engagement with insurgents in
Santa Clara province, has just reached
Havana. This has caused the utmost
excitement in palace and social circles,
and every effort is being made to get
news from General Pando's force to
verify the startling news.
No" details of the killing of the com
mander have been received, but th
ntatement is that he was shot in a Via
tie with insurgents while on the march
from Sagua la Grande to the southern
coast of Santa Clara, where he was to
take a ship for Manzanillo.
Officers at the palace declare that the
story must be thoroughly confirmed be
fore they will believe it.
General Pando's plan was to march
right through the heart of the territory
where General Gomez' forces are said
to have control. Simultaneously with
the report of Pando's death comes news
of a battle near Matanzas in which the
Spanish forces were driven from the
field. This engagement was bitterly
fought, and it is asserted that the
losses of the Spaniards was very heavy.
The same report says the Cubans
will not allow any cane grinding, and
also that the Spanish towns ilo not fa
vor grinding, because they hold the
zones of cultivation and grow tobacco
with cheap labor, which they would
lose if the reconcentrados return to
work on the estates.
A letter received by a local paper
from a correspondent in the East gives
news of big fighting last week near
Bayamo between the rehel Chief llabi
and General Linares. General Kabi
had only 500 men when General Lin
ares had two columns. No details of
the fight are at hand, but the Spanish
loss is said to have been heavy, one col
umn being nearly destroyed.
A force of 1,000 Spaniards, with ar
tillery, liave forced the rebels into the
hills of Pinar del Rio. They must re
main there or come out and light, a
thing the Spanish commanders think
they are not likely to do. Small bands
are still moving about with great cau
tion.
Reports of the condition and move
ments of rebels in the east are most
conflicting. It is said that Gomez is
coming west with 40,000 men, but it is
also said that Gomez is still at the
camp where he has been for the last 10
months, and is being attended by Dr.
(Jandea, staff surgeon.
Smallpox In San Domingo.
Havana, Dec. 6. — The deplorable
condition of the country grows moiv
and more apparent. Refugees and re
concentrados are growing more and
more miserable. According to reports
from San Domingo smallpox is making
terrible ravages among the concentrados.
Since April last more than 4.000 have
died in the city alone, to say nothing
of the suburban towns, which are like
wise affected.
The local authorities take no steps
whatever to check the mortality. The
streets of the city are thionged with
famine stricken wretches, who succumb
to disease under perhaps some lonely
porch, and sometimes fall dead in the
gutter, where they remain.
DUE TO THE KLONDIKE RUSH.
Itig War In Paiamger Hates to Ar
rive Boou.
Milwaukee, Dec. 2.—The war in pas
senger rates between Chicago, Milwau
kee and St. Paul is likely to continue,
and railroad men look for the liveliest
kind of cutting in rates further west,
owing to the big rush to the Klondike!
A well-known railroad man said today
that since the rate dropped to $7, reduc
tions in fares will likely result as far
west as Portland. The nominal rate is
149.70 second-class on the St. Paul road,
and |59.70 first-class. With |7 froni
Chicago to St. Paul as a basis, the fare
will probably be changed to $47 second
class and f57 first-class. He added that
this was merely a preliminary for the
establishment of an entirelvnew sched
ule of rates to the West January 1,
which will be much lower. All'the
roads are preparing to make special
j rates to the points nearest the Klondike
region, and each road is after all there
is in it.
Outlaw* Were Frustrated.
St. Louis, Mo., Dec. 6.—A special
to the Post-Dispatch from San Antonio,
Tex., says: "Advices were received
here this morning of an attempt to hold
up and rob a paßsenger train on the
Mexican National railroad near Mon
terey, Mexico, by nine masked and
well-armed Mexicans. The passengers
made resistance, and the outlaws were
unsuccessful. They are being pursued
by soldiers, and if captured will be
shot.
Killed Her Babies.
Philadelphia, Deo. 6.—Anna Nig
gle, the young wife of S. Niggle, a pic
ture frame dealer, living at 738 Jackson
street, tonight killed her two babies,
one aged 3 years, and one aged 6
months, by smothering them with illu
minating gas. The woman attempted
to committ suicide in the same man
ner, and the returning husband found
his children dead and his wife in an
unconscious condition. She may re
cover.
Tlie Mexican Murderess.
Bakersfield, Oal. # Doc. 6.—Because
Emillio Ramos refused to buy a drink

Mexicans are joining in the search for
Molina.

What Our Neighboring Citle. and
Count Ip» Ar« Doing.
Apples have been selling in Yakima
for 80 cents a box.
A colony from Crossville, Term., is
expected to arrive in Yakima county
next spring.
The Rosy In mines are running full
time, shipping from 90 to 100 tons of
coal per day.
The Coweeman river, in Cowlitz
county, is full of logs and shingles from
Kelso to the Dillon farm.
A lot of California quail have been
turned loose near Ilwaco, and banters
are expected to give the birds a chance
to increase and multiply.
The two Willapa harbor canneries
made small packs this fall. Ihe Mo-
Gowan cannery on North river parked
onlv 7,800 cases in all, and the Barnes
cannery, at South Bend, 9,000 cases.
A Garfield man has this year market
ed ft,30.37 worth of apples, has
left all he can use. He thinks Wash
ington apples will one day be shipped
regularly to Liverpool.
The state hoard of land commission
ers met in the capital Tuesday. A pe
tition from the citizens of Blame, ask
ing for a change in the inner harbor
line in front of that city was rejected
for want of jurisdiction.
The Paloiise Irrigation Company has
the big reservoir and six miles of canal
completed within Franklin county.
This brings it to within four miles of
Washtucna, which part of the county
will be watered next season.
A North Yakima man has shipped
to Chicago 2,200 head of sheep, 10 car
loads in all. These are the sheep he
has been feeding in the Moxee. He
expects to bring about 2,500 head more
froin Mabton to lie fed this winter.
A great many of the apples shipped
from Coos county are being sold as
Northern California apples, and the
choice potatoes sent from Coos are also
put on the market as a California prod
uct, and are called Salinas burbanks.
The treasurer of Coos county has is
sued a call for all county orders indorsed
prior to January 11, 1892. This call
will caned indebtedness amounting in
all to $7,000. A few weeks ago a call
was issued for warrants amounting to
$3,500.
Adjutant-General Ballaine is now
prepared to furnish the several militia
companies of the state with the new in
fantry drill regulations, prepared by
Lieutenant Arthur Murray, of the First
United States artillery, and approved
by the secretary of war.
It is reported that in the recent flood
hundreds of head of stock perished in

chance to get stock to the higher lands.
A representative of the fish and game
com mission of California has been in
Siskiyou county and Southern Oregon

been shipped from Ager in one day.
Parties arriving in Everett from the
Skykomish valley state that the damage
to the Great Northern is greater than
was at first reported. The chinook
which melted the snow to the top of
the lower mountain ranges, to which

the smaller streams over their banks.
The Pacific Lumber Trade Journal
has secured a list showing that at least
"JO per cent of the shingle mills in the
state of Washington either have or will
within the next 60 days close down for
the winter. The information came in
the shape of answers to inquiries sent
out by the Jojrnal, which recommend
ed the closing of mills so as to have a
price for the product in the spring.
There appears to be almost a unanimity
of feeling on the part of the cutters in
favor of maintaining prices, which can
only be done by reducing the cut of the
winter to prevent Eastern yardmen and
brokers from overstocking, thus holding
the price down during the season of de
mand in the East.
Word has been received at the local
land office in Spokane that the secre

north of the present town of Colville.
l'he appraised value of the tracts ranges
from $3.40 to $lyo apiece. The total
acreage is 1,045.41. The appraisement
was made in August by Fred Harring
ton, S. F. Sherwood and Jacob Stetzel.
By this sale one of tho pioneer military
posts of the Northwest is wiped out.
lor years the fort and surrounding set
t lenient contained the largest popula
tion of any town in the Inland Empire.
District court was held there, and the
town was tho outfitting point for many
miners and trappers. In 1884 tho
troops at the old post were transferred
to the new barracks at Fort Spokane,
on the Columbia river. Since that
time the town has fast been passing
away, and a few yeas ago the last
house was destroyed by tire. Where
once was a prosperous, bustling com
munity is now a wilderness of deserted
ruins and young pine trees.
