SOUTHERN STATES.
The permanent pacification of the country
by the complete protection of all citizens in
every civil and political right continues to
oc ot paramount interest with the great body
of ourpenple. Every step in this direction is
yelcoined with publlo approval, and every
Interruption of steady and uniform
progress to. the desired consum
2S a a'CW'ens general uneasiness and
wIde-sree.iicondemnation. The recent Con
sressiQifal elections lui e funilshed a direct
and trustworthy test of the advance thus far
nae in the practical establishment of the
tight of suffrage, secured by the Constitution
to the liberated race In the Southern btatcs.
All disturbing Influences, real or imaginary,
nad been removed from all of these States.
The three constitutional amendments,
which conferred freedom and equality of civ
il and political rights upon the colored peo
ple of the South, n ere adopted by the con
current action of the great body cf good citi
zens who maintained the authority of the
National Government and tho Integrity and
perpetuity of the Union at such a cost of
treasure and life, as a wise and necessary
embodiment in tho organic law of the just
results of the war. The people of the former
slave-holding States accepted these results,
and gave, in every practicable form, assur
ances that the thirteenth, fourteenth and lif-
leemn amendments, ana laws passed in pur
euanee thereof, should, in irmxi faith ho m.
farced, rigidly and impartially. In letter and
spirit, to the end that the humblest citizen,
without distinction of race or color, should.
uuuer mem, receive iuii ana equal protec
tion in person and property and in political
riltuis ana privileges. uy these con
stitutional amendments, the Southern
section ot the Union obtained a
large increase of political power in
Congress and in the Electoral College, and
the country justly expected that election?
would proceed, as to uie enfranchised race,
upon the same circumstances of legal ana
constitutional freedom and protection which
obtained In all the other States of the Union.
The friends of la w and order looked forward
to the conduct of these elections, as offering
mj wjo general juugnieni 01 uie country an
important opportunity to nieasuro the degree
la which the tight of suffrage could be exer
cised by the colored people, and would be re
spected by their fellow-citizens; but a mora
general enjoyment of freedom ot suffrage by
the colored people, and a more just and gen
erous protection of that freedom by the com
munities of which they form a part, were
generally anticipated than the record of the
election discloses. In some of those States In
which the colored people have been unable
to make their opinions felt in the elections,
the result is mainly due to influences not
easily measured or remedied by legal protec
tion; bntln the States of Louisiana and South
Carolina at large, and in some particular con
gressional districts outside of thoee States,the
rt cords of the elections seem to compel the
conclusion that tho lightsof the colored vot
ers have been overridden, and their partici
pation in the elections not permitted to be
either general or free.
It will be for the Congress for which these
elections were held, to make such examina
tions into their conduct as may be appropri
ate to determine the validity of the claims of
members to their seats. In tho meanwhile it
becomes the dnty of the Executive and Ju
dicial Departments of the Government, each
in Its province, to inquire into and punish
violations of the laws ot the United States
which have occurred. I can but repeat what
I said in this connection in my last message,
that whatever authority rests with me to this
end I shall not hesitate to put forth, and I am
unwilling to forego a renewed appeal to the
legislatures, the courts, the executive au
thorities, and the people of the States where
these wrongs have been perpetrated, to give
their assistance towards bringing to justice
the offenders and preventing a repetition of
the crimes. So means within my power will
be spared to obtain a full and fair investiga
tion of the alleged crimes, and to secure the
conviction and lust punishment of the irailtv.

In accordance with the provisions of the
act of February 28, 1S73. three commissioners
Were appointed to an international confer
ence on the subject of adopting a common
ratio between gold and silver, tor the pur
posed establishing. Internationally, the use
of bimetallic money, and securing fixity of
relative value between those metals.
Imitations were addressed to the various
Go crnments which had expressed a willing
ness to participate in its deliberations. Tho
conference held its meetings ii Paris, In Aug
ust last. The report of the commissioners,
herewith submitted, will show its results. No
common ratio between gold and silver
could be agreed upon by the conference.
The general conclusion was reached that it
is necessary to maintain in tho world the
monetary functions of silver as well as of
gold, leaving the selection of the use of one
or the other of these two metals, or of both,
to be made by each State.
Congress having apnropriated at its last
session the sum of J3.M0.0W) to nav the award
of the Joint Commission at Halifax, if, after
correspondence with tho British Govern
ment, on the suhji-ct of the conformity of tha
award to the requirements of the treaty and
to the terms of tho question thereby sub
mitted to the Commission, the President shall
deem it his dutv to make the eavment. com
munications upon these points were address
ed to the British Government through the
legation of the United States at London.
Failing to obtain the concurrence of the Brit
ish Government in the views ot this Govern
ment respectingtbe award, I have deemed tt
my duty to tender the sum named, within
the year fixed by the treaty, accompanied by
a notice of the grounds of the payment, and
a protest against any other construction of
the same. The correspondence upon this
subject will be laid before you.
The Spanish Government has official
ly announced the termination of the
Insurrection in Cuba, and the 'res
toration of peaco throughout that
island. Confident expectations ore express
ed of a revival of trade and prosperity, which
it is earnestly hoped may prove well found
ed. Numerous claim of American citizens
for relief for injuries or restoration of p op
erty have been among the incidents of long
continued hostilities. Some of these claims
are in process of adjustment by Spain, and
the others are promised early and careful
consideration.
The treaty made with Italy, in regard to
reciprocal consular privileges, has been du
ly ratified and proclaimed.
No questions of grave Importance have
arisen with any other of the European pow
er. Ttie Japanese Government has been de
slrousof a revision of such parts of Its treaties
with foreign powers as relate to commerce,
and, it is understood, has addressed to each
ol the treaty powers a request to open nego
tiations u lth that view. The Uulied States
Government has been inclined to
regard tho matter favorably. What
ever restrictions upon trado with
Japan are found Injurious to that people can
not but affect injuriously nations holding
commercial intercourse with them. Japan.
after a long period of seclusion, has within
the past few ears made rapid strides in the
path of enlightenment and progress, and,
nut unreasonably, is looking forward to the
time when her relations with the
nations of Europe and America
shall be assimilated to those
which they hold with each other. A treaty
looking tn this end has been made, which
will be submitted lor the consideration of the
Senate.
Alter an interval of several years, the Chi
nese Government has again sent envoys to
thu United States. They have been received,
and a nermanent legation is now established
hercbythatGovernraent. It is not doubted
that this step mil be of advantage to both
nations in promoting friendly relations and
removing causes of diffcren. c. The treaty
witn the Samoan. Islands, having been duly
ratified and accepted on the part of both
Governments, Is now in operation, and a sur
vey and soundings of the harbor of Pago
Pago have been made by a naval vessel of the
United States, with a view of its occupation
as a naval station, if found desirable to the
service.
Since the resumption of diplomatic rela
tions with Mexico, correspondence has been
opened and still continues between the two
Governments upon the various questions
which at one time seemed to endanger their
relations. While no formal agreement has
been reached as to the troubles on the bor
der, much has been done to repress and di
minish them. The effective force of United
States troops on the lUo Grande, by a strict
and faithful compliance with instructions,
bas done much to remove the sources of dis
pute, and it is now understood that a like
force of Mexican troops on the other side of
the river is also making an energetic move
ment against the marauding Indian tribes.
This Government looks with the greatest
satisfaction upon every evidence of strength
in the national authority of Mexico, and up
on every effort put forth to prevent or to
punish incursions .upon .our territory. Bo
luctant to assume any action or attitude in
the control of these incursions, by military
movements across the border, not impera
tively demanded for the protection of the
lives and property of our own citizens, I
shall take the earliest opportunity, consistent
with the proper discharge of this plain duty,
to recognize the ability of the Mexican Gov
ernment to restrain effectively violations ot
our territory. It is proposed to bold next
year an International Exhibition in Mexico,
and it is believed that the display of the ag
ricultural and manufacturing product of
the two nations will tend to better under

are as follows: Actual receints for the first
quarter commencing July 1, 1878, 573,3.-9,7 13.43;

year ending June 30, lstf, of H .100,000.
The total receipts dining the next fiscal
year, ending Juno 30, 180, estlmaUd accord
ing to cxlsiioglaws, Mill be JiMOO.liOu; and
the estimated ordinary expenditures, for the
same period, will be JiKO.lli.GS; leading a
surplus of 28,i;W7jJ for that year.
In the foregoing statements of expendi
tures, actual and estimated, nb amount is al
lowed Tot the Mnklng-fund prolded for by
the act approved 1'ebrunry i 1S0, which re
quires that bne per cent, of the entire debt of
the United MjHtM snail be purchased or paid
witldn eaOh ilscal year, to be set apart as a
sinking fund. There has beeh, however, a
Substantial comp'lance, with the conditions
of the law. Ity it tetlt!, the public debt
Bhouli bav been reduced, between Iff 2 and
the Cl'ose of the lsst fiscal year, y.13,3'13'6.28;
the actual redaction of the ascertained debt,
in that period, has been $720,611,739X1; being
In excess of the reduction required by the
Sinking-fund act $20Ja3.S33.33. ,
The amount ot the public debt, less cash
tn the TrJJaMiryj Kovembcr 1, 1878, was $2,
p!4,2O0,DSU8 a reduction, since the same date
last year, of $23,l50,G17-3.
The progress made during the last year, in
refunding the public debt at lower rates of
interest, is very gratifying. The amount of
(per cent, bonds sold during the present
ycarpnor to Aovemuer aj, ls.s.is ;iuu,z,u,vw.
and 6 per cent, bonds, commonly known as

or wijl be, redeemed as callsmature.
It has been the policy of the Department
to place the 4 per cent, bonds within easy
reach of every citizen who desires to Invest
his savings, whether small or great, in these
securities. The Secretary of the Treasury
ecommends that the law bo so modlfled.that
mall sums maybelnvested,andthatthrongli
the post-offices, or other agents of the Cov
ernment, the freest opportunity may be given
in all parts of the country for such invest
ments. A-mA.,tAS ,. A Annul n..Ann. n ...... 1.AA.
The best mode suggested Ig.that the Depart
ment be authorized to issue certificates of do
posit, of the denomination of ten dollars,
bearing interest at the rate of 3.61 per cent,
per annum and convertible at any time with
in one year after their issue into the four per
cent, bonds authorized by the Refunding act,
and to be issued only in exchange of United
States notes sent to the Treasury by mall
or otherwise. Such a provision of law, sup
ported by suitable regulations, would enable
any person readily, without cost or risk, to
convert his money into an interest-bearing
security of the United States, and the money
bo received could be applied to the redemp
tion of six per cent, bonds.
Tho coinage of gold during the last fiscal
year was $32,793,980. The coinage of silver
dollars, nnder the aot passed February 28,
1878, amounted, on the 2(dof November, 1878,
to 519,811,5:0, of which amount $1,934,947 is In
circulation, and the balance,$14,820,C03,is still
in the possession of the Government.
With views unchanged with regard to the
act under which the coinage of silver pro
ceeds, it has been the purpose of the Secretary
faithfully to execute the law, and to afford a
fair trial to the measure.
In tho present financial condition of the
country, 1 am persuaded that tho welfare of
legitimate business and Industry of every
description will be best promoted by ab
staining from all nttempts to make radical
changes in tho existing financial legislation.
Let It be understood that during tho coining
yciirtuB uusiiiessoi me country wiu ue un
disturbed by governmental Interference with
the laws affecilng it, and we may confidently
expect that the resumption of specie pay
ments, which will take place at the appointed
time, trill be successfully and easily main
tained, and that it will be followed by a
healthful and endurisg revival of business
prosperity.
Let the healing influence of time, the in
herent energies of our people, and the bound
less resources of our country, have a fair op
portunity, and relief from present difficulties
will surely follow.
THE ARMT.
The report of the Secretary of War shows
that the army has been well and economical
ly supplied, tbat our small force bas been ac
tively employed, and bos folthlully perform
ed all the service required of tt. The morale
of the army has improved, and the number
of desertions bas materially decreased dur
ing the year.
lhn Secretary recommends
1. That a pension be srrantedto tho widow
of the late Lieutenant llenry 1L Benuer, 18th
Infantry, who lost his life by yellow fever
while in command of the steamer "J. M.
Chambers," sent with supplies for tho relief
of sufferers in the South trom tbat disease.
2. The establishment of the annuity scheme
for the benefit ot the heirs of deceased of
ficers, as suggested by the Paymaster-General.
3. The adoption by Congress of a plan for
the publication ot the records of the Wnrof
the Rebellion, now being prepared for that
purpose.
4. The increase of the extra per diem of
soldier-teachers employed in post-schools,
and liberal appropriations for the erection
ot buildings for schools and libraries at the
diflV rent posts.
5. The repeal or amendment of the act of
June 18, 1873, forbidding the "use of the Army
as a poue eomitatut, or otherwise, for the pur
pose of executing the laws, except in such
cases and under such circumstances as may
be expressly authorized by the Constitution
or by act of Congress."
6. The passage of a joint resolution of Con
gress legalizing the issues of rations, tents,
and medicines which were made for the re
lief of sufferers from yellow-fever.
7. That provision be made for the erection
of a lire-proof building for the preservation
of certain valuable records, now constantly
exposeu to destruction oy nre.
These recommendations are all commended
to your favorable consideration.
THE NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy
shows that the Navy has Improved during the
last fiscal year. Work has been done on
seventy-five vessels, ten of which hae been
thoroughly repaired and Jiade ready for sea.
Two others are in rapid progress towards
completion. The total expenditures ot tho
year, including the nmount appropriated for
the deficiencies of tho previous year, were
517.4o3M.C'). The actual expenses
chargeable to the year, exclusive
of these deficiencies, were 31300,911.09. or
$707,199.13 less than those of the previous
year, and $l,y2",UT7.74 less than the expenses,
including the deficiencies. The estimates for
the fiscal jear ending June 30, 1SSQ, are $14,
562.3Sj.15 exceeding the appropriations of
the present earonly $33,919.75; which excess
Is occasioned by the demands of the Naval
Academy and the Marina Corps, as explained
in the Secretary's report. The appropria
tions for the present fiscal year are $142S,
431.70, which, in the opinion of the Secretary,
will be ample for all the current expenses of
the Department during the year. The
amount drawn from the Treasury fram July
1. to November 1, 1S7S, Is $4,740,344.14, of which
$70,980.75 has been refunded, leaving as the
expenditure for that period $4,6-90, or
$520,899.24 less than the corresponding period
of the last fiscal year.
POSTAL AFFAIRS.
The report of the Postmaster-General em
braces a detailed statement of the operations
of the Post-office Department. Tne expendi
tures of that Department fox the fiscal year
ended June St, 1878, were $94463,084.49. The
receipts, including sales of stamps, money
order business, and official stamps,
were $29,277,510-95. The sum ot
5290,436.90, included in the foregoing state
ment of expenditures, is chargeable to pre
ceding years, so that the aetuaTexpeadlturcs
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, are
$33,874,647.50. The amount drawn from tho
Treasury on appropriations, tn addition to
the revenues of the department, was $5,307,
651&2. The expenditures for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1830, are estimated at $36,571,
900, and the receipts from an sources at $30.
064,023.90, leaving a deficiency to be appropri
ated ont of the Treasury of $3,907,876.10. The
report calls attention to the fact that the
compensation ot postmasters and of railroads
for carrying the mall Is regulated by law, and
that tbe failure of Congress to appropriate
the amounts required for these purposes does
not relieve the Government of responsibility,
but necessarily increases the deficiency bills
which Congress will be called upon to'pass.
In providing for the postal service, the fol
lowing questions are presented: Should
Congress annually appropriate a sujn tor its
expenses largely in excess of its revenues, or
should such rates of postage be established
as will make tbe Department self-sustaining?
Should the postal service be reduced by ex
cluding from tne mails, matter which does
not pay Me way? Should the number of post -routes
be d-nlniabed? Should other methods
be adopted whiohwilLiBerease tbe revenues
or diminish the expenses of the postal serv
ioe? -
The International Postal Congress, which
met at Paris Hay 1, 1878, and continued in
session until Jnue 4 of tbe same year, was
composed of delegates fxom nearly all the

and with the consent ot the President, Aug

Sojhe embarrassment has arisen out ot the
conflict between the customs laws of this

Convention, in regard to the transmission of
foreign books and newspapers to this country

able to devtse some means Of leconclllngthe
difficulties which have thus been created, so
as to do justice to all parties involved.
TUB COURTS.
The business ol the Supreme Court, and ot
the courts In many of the circuits, has In
creased to such an extent during tbe past
years that additional legislation is impera
tive to relieve and prevent the delay of jus
tice, and possible oppression to suitors,
which Is thus occasioned. The encumbered
condition of these dockets is presented anew
in the report cf tbe Attorney-General, and
tbe remedy suggested Is earnestly urged for
Congressional action. The creation ot addi
tional circuit judges, as proposed, would
afford a complete remedy, and wonld Involve
an expense at tbe present rate of salaries
of not more than $60,000 a year.
OCR riDIAN TKODBLES.
The annual reports of the Secretary of tho
Interior and of the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs, present an elaborate account of the
present condition of tbe Indian tribes, and of
that branch of tbe public r ervtce which min
isters to their interests. While the conduct
of the Indians, generally, has been orderly,
and their relations with their neighbors
friendly and peaceful, two local disturbances
have occurred, which wero denlorable in their
character, but remained, happily, confined to
a comparatively small number of Indians.
Tbe discontent among the Bannocks, which
led first to some acts of violence on the part
of some members of the tribe and finally to
tbe outbreak, appears to have been caused
by an lnsfllclency of food on the reservation,
and this insufficiency to have been owing to
the inadequacy of the appropriations, made
by Congress, to tbe wants of the Indians, at a
time when the Indians were prevented from
supplying the deficiency by hunting. After
an arduous pursuit by the troops of the Unit
ed States, and several engagements, tbe hos
tile Indian were reduced to subjection, and
the larger part of tbem surrendered them
selves as prisoners. In tills connection, I de
sire to call attention to tho recommendation
mado by tho Secretary of the Interior, that a
sufficient fund be placed nt tbe disposal of
the Executive, to be ustd, with proper ac
countability, at discretion, in sudden emer
gencies ot the Indian f ervioe.
The other case of disturbance was that of a
band of Northern Oheyennea who suddenly
left their reservation in the Indian Territory
and marched rapidly through the States of
Kansas and Nebraska in the direction of their
old hunting-grounds, committing murders
and other crimes on their way. From
documents accompanying the report of the
Secretary of the Interior,- It appears that
this disorderly band was as fully supplied
with the necessaries of life as the 4,7u0 other
Indians who remained quietly on the reserva
tion, and that the disturbance was caused by
men ui a restless aim uiiscuievous uispoaiiiun
among the Indians themselves. Almost tbe
whole of this band bate surrendered to tbe
military authorities, and it is a gratitying fact
that, when some of tbem bad taken refuge tn
the ca.np ot the Red Cloud Sioux with whom
they had been in friendly relations, the Sioux
held them as prisoners and readily gave them
up to the officers of the United States, thus
giving new proof of the loyal spirit which,
alarming rumors to the contrary notwith
standing, they have uniformly showed ever
since the wishes they expressed at the
council of September, 1877, had been com
plied with.
Both tbe Secretary of the Interior and tbe
Secretary of War unite in the recommenda
tion tbat provision be made by Congress tor
the organization of a corps of mounted "In
dian auxiliaries," to be under the control of
the Army, and to be used for the purpose of
keeping the Indians on their reservations
ana preventing or repressing disturbance on
their port. I earnestly concur in this recom
mendation. It Is believed that the organiza
tion of such a bodv of Indian eavalrv. re.
eclving a moderate pay from the
Government, would considerably weaken
the restless element among the Indians, by
withdrawing from it a number ot young men
and giving tbem congenial employment un
der the Government, it being a matter of ex
perience that Indians tn our service almost
without exception are faithful tn the per
formance of the duties assigned to tbem.
Such an organization would materially aid
the Army In the accomplishment of a task
for which its numerical strength Is some
times found insufficient.
But, while tbe employment of force for the
prevention or repression ot Indian troubles
is of occasional necessity, and wise prepara
tion should be made to that end, greater re
liance must be placed on humane and civil
izing agencies far the ultimate solution of
what is called the Indian problem. It may be
very difficult, and require much patient ef
fort, to curb the unruly spirit of the savage
Indian to tbe restraints of civilized life, but
experience shows that it Is net Impossible.
Many of tbe tribes which are now quiet and
orderly and self-supporttog ware once as
savage as any that at present roam ovsr tbe
plains or in the mountains of tne far west,
and were then ceasMered lnaeeesstkle to
dvilisiag influences. Itmay be lmpoasltua
to raise them fully up to the level qf the
white population of tbe United States; but
wo should not forget tbat they are
the aborigines of the country, and
called the soil their own on which
our people have grown rich, powerful, and
happy. We owe It to them as a moral duty
to help them in attaining at least that degree
of civilization which they may be able to
reach. It is not only our duty It is also our
Interest to do so. Indians who have become
agriculturists or herdsmen, and feel an in
terest in property, will thenceforth cease to
be a warlike and disturbing element. It Is
also a well authenticated fact that Indians
are apt to be peaceable and quiet when their
children are at school, and I am gratified to
know, trom tbe expressions of Indians them
selves and from many concurring reports,
that there is a steadily Increasing desire,
even among Indians belonging to compara
tively wild tribes, to have their children ed
ucated. I Invite attention to tbe reports of
the Secretary of the Interior and the Com
missioner ot Indian Affairs, touching the ex
Fieriment recently Inaugurated, in taking fifty
odlan children, boys and girls, from differ
ent tribes, to the Hampton Normal Agricul
tural institute, In Virginia, where thev are to
receive an elementary English education and
training in agriculture and other useful work,
to be returned to their tribes, after the com
pleted course, as interpreters, instructors,
and examples. It is reported that tbe officer
charged with the selection ot those children
might have had thousands of young Indians
sent with him had it been possible to make
provision for tbem. I agree with the Secre
tary of tbe Interior in saying that "the re
sult of this interesting experiment, If
favorable, may be destined to become an im
portant factor in the advancement of civili
zation among the Indians."
The question, whether a change In the con
trol of tbe Indian service should be made,
was, at the last session of Congress, referred
to a committee for inquiry and report. W lth
out desiring to anticipate that report. I ven
ture to express the hope that, in the decision
of so important a question, tbe views ex
pressed above may not be lost sight of, and
that tbe decision, whatever it may be. will ar
rest further agitation of this subject, such
agitation being apt to produce a disturbing
effect upon tbe service as well as on the In
dians themselves.
In the enrollment of the bill making appro
priations for sundry civil expenses, at the last
session of Congress, that portion which, pro
vided for the continuation ot the Hot Springs
Commission was omitted. As tbe commis
sion bad completed tbe work of taking testi
mony on the many conflicting claims, the
suspension of their labors, before determin
ing tbe rights of claimants, threatened, for a
time, to embarrass tbe Interests, not only ot
the Government, but also of a large number
of tbe citizens of Hot Springs, who were
waiting for final action on their claims be
fore beginning contemplated improvements.
In order to prevent serious difficulties, which
were apprehended, and at the solicita
tion of many leading citizens ot
Hot Springs, and others Interested tn
the welfare of the town, the Secretarr of tha
Interior was authorized to request the late
commissioners to take charge of the records
of their proceedings, and to perform such
workas could properly be done by tbem un
ci suebclreamstanceajto facfUtstg the future
adindieatlon of the elalms at an early dav. and
to preserve the status ot tbe claimants until
their rights should be finally determined.
Tbe late commissioners complied with that
request, and report that the testimony, tn all
tbe cases.'has been written out, examined,
briefed; and so arranged as to taci.ltate an
early settlement when authorized by law. It
is recommended that the requisite authority
be given at as earlv a dav in the session as
possible, and tbat a fair compensation be al
io wed the late commissioners for the expense
incurred andtbe'Iabor performed by tbem
PRESEKVATION OP FORESTS.
I Invite the attention of congress to the
recommendations made by the Secretary of
the Interior with regard to the preservation
of the timber on the public lands of the Unit
ed States. Tbe protection of the public prop
erty is one of the first duties ot tbe Govern
ment. The Department ot the Interior
should, there fere, be enabled by sufficient
appropriations to enforce tbe laws tn that
respect. But this matter appears still more
Important as a question of publlo economy.
Tho rapid destruction "of our forests
ts an evil fraught with tbe gravest
consequences, especially in the mountainous
districts, where the rocky slopes ,once denud
ed ot their trees, will remain so forever.
There the injury, once done, can not be re-
pairea. i iuuy concur witn tne secretary oi
tho Interior in the opinion that, for this rea
son, legislation touching the public timber in
the mountainous States and Territories of
the West, shonld be esDeciallv well consider
ed, and that existing laws, in which tho de
struction of the forests Is not sufficiently
Saarded against, should be speedily modf
ed. A general law concerning this Important
subject appears to me to be a matter of ur
gent public necessity.
OUR AOIUCULTUKAI. 15TE1IEST8
. From the organization of the Government,
the Importance ot encouraging, by all possi
ble means, the Increase of our agricultural
productions has been acknowledged and
urged upon the attention ot Congress and
the people as tbe surest and readiest means
of increasing our substantial and enduring
prosperity.
The words of Washington are as applicable
to-day as when, In his eighth annual message,
he said: "It is not to be doubted that, with
reference either to individual or national
welfare, agriculture is of primary import
ance. In proportion as "nations advance in
population and other circumstances of ma
turity, this truth becomes more apparent,
and renders tho cultivation of the soil more
and more an object of public patronage. In
stitutions for promoting tt grow up, support
ed by the publlo purse and to what object
can it be dedicated with greater propriety?
Among the means which have been employ
ed to this end. none have been attended with
greater success than the establishment of
boards composed of proper characters,
charred with collecting and dlffuslnsr infor
mation, and enabled, by premiums and small
pecuniary aids, to encourage and assist tbe
spirit ot discovery and improvement, this
aousnmenc comnnutiug aouo-
ly to tho Increase of Improvement by stlmu
lattntr to enterprise anu experiment, ana w
drawing to a common center the results ev
erywhere of Individual skill and observation,
and spreading them thence over the whole
Nation. Experience accordingly bath shown
that tbey are very cheap instruments of im
mense National benefit."
Tbe great preponderance ot the agricultu
ral over any other Interest In the United
States, entitles it to all tbe consideration
claimed for it by Washington. About one
half of the population of the United States is
engaged in agriculture. The value of tho ag
ricultural products of the United States, for
the year 1873, is estimated at three thousand
millions of dollars. The exports of agricultu
ral products for tbe year 1877, as appears
trom the report of the Bureau of Sta
tistics, were live hundred and twenty-four
millions of dollars. The great extent of our
country, with its diversity ot soil and climate,
enables us to produce within our own bor
ders, and by our own labor, not only the neor
essaries but most ot tbe luxuries that are
consumed in civilized countries. Yet, not
withstanding our advantages of soil, climate.
and intercommunication, it appears, from
the statistical statements tn the report of tbe
Commissioner of Agriculture, that we import
annually from foreign lands many millions
of dollars' worth of agricultural products
which could be raised in our own country.
Numerous questions arise in the practice of
aavancea agriculture wnicn can omy oe an
swered by experiments, often costly and
sometimes fruitless, which are beyond tbe
means of private individuals, and are a just
proper charge on the whole nation for the
benefit of the nation. It is good policy, es
pecially in times of depression and uncer
tainty in other business pursuits, with a vast
area of uncultivated, ana hence unproductive
territory, wisely opened to homestead settle
ment, to encourage, by every proper and
legitimate means, the occupation and tillage
ol the soil. The efforts of the Department of
Agriculture to stimulate old and in
troduce new agricultual industries,
to improve the quality and in
crease tbe quantity of our products,
to determine the value of old or establish
tbe Importance of new methods of culture,
are worthy of your careful and favorable
consideration and assistance by such ap
propriations of money and enlargement of
facilities as may seem to be demanded by tbe
present favorable conditions for the growth
and rapid development of this important in
terest. The abuse of animals in transit is widely
attracting public attention. A national con
vention of societies specially interested In
the subject has recently met at Baltimore,
and the fact developed, both in regard to
cruelties to animals and tho effect of .such
crueltlesupon the public health, would seem
to demand the careful consideration of Con-
Kess, and the enactment of more efficient
nrs for the prevention of these abuses.
EDUCATIONAL MATTERS.
The report of the Commissioner of the Bu
reau of Education shows ery gratifylngpro
gress throughout the country, in all the In
terests committed to the care of this Impor
tant office. Tho report Is especially encour
aging with respect to the extension of the
advantages of tbe common-school system, in
sections of the country where the general
enjoyment of the privilege ot free schools is
not jet attained.
To education more than to any other agen
cy we are to look, as the resource for the ad
vancement ot the people, the requisite
knowledge and appreciation of their rights
and responsibilities as citizens, and I
desire to repeat the suggestion contained in
my former message in behalf of the enact
ment of appropriate measures by Congress
for the purpose of supplementing, with na
tional aid, the local systems of education in
the several States.
Adequate accommodations for tbe great
library, which is overgrowing tha capacity of
the rooms now occupied at the Capitol,
should be provided without further delay.
This Invaluable collection ot books, manu
scripts, and illustrative art, has grown to
such proportions, In connection with the
copyright system of the country, as to de
mand the prompt and careful attention of
Congress to save It from Injury In Its prercnt
crowded and insufficient quarters. As this
library is national in its character, and must,
from the nature of the case. Increase even
more rapidly tn the future than in the past,
it can cot be doubted that the people will
sanction any wise expenditure to preserve It
and to enlarge its usefulness.
The appeal of the Regents of the Smith
sonian Institution for the means to organize,
exhibit and mnke available tor the publlo
benefit the articles now stored away belong
ing to the National Museum, I heartily rec
ommend to your favorable consideration.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
The attention of Congress Is again
invited to the condition of the
river-front of the City of Washington, It is a
matter of vital Importance to the health of
tbe residents of the National Capital,
both temporary and permanent, that tbe
low lands In front of tho city, now subject to
Udal overflow, should be reclaimed. In their
present condition, these flats obstruct the
drainage ot the city, and are a dangerous
source of malarial poison. The reclamation
will Improve the navigation of the river by
restricting and consequently deepening its
channel; and is also of importance, when
considered in connection with tbe extension
ot the public ground and the enlargement of
the park, west and south of the Washington
Monument. The report of the board of sur
vey, heretofore ordered by act of Congress
on the improvement of the harbor of Wash
f ngton and Georgetown, is respectfully com
mended to consideration.
The report of the Commissioner of the Dis
trict of Columbia presents a detailed state
ment of the affairs of the District.
Tbe relative expenditures by the United
States and the District for local purposes is
contrasted, showing that the expenditures
by the people ot tbe District greatly exceed
those of the General Government. Tbe ex
hibit is made In connection with estimates
for the requisite repair ot tbe detective pave
ments and -sewers of the city, which
Is a work of immediate necessity,
and, tn the same connection, a plan Is
presented for the permanent funding of the
outstanding securities of the District.
The benevolent, reformatory and penal in
stitutions of tbe District are all entitled to
tbe favorable attention of Congress. Tbe
Reform School needs additional buildings
and teachers. Appropriations which will
place all of these institutions In a condition
to become models of usefulness and benefl
oenoe, will be regarded by tbe country as lib
erality wisely bestowed.
Tbe Commissioners, with 'evident Justice,
request attention to the discrimination made
by Congress against tbe District in tbe dona
tion ot land for the support of the public
schools, and ask that the same liberality tbat
has been shown to the inhabitants of the
various States and Territories of the United
States may be extended to tbe District of
Columbia.
Tbe Commissioners also Invite attention to
the damage Inflicted upon public and pn
vate interests by the present location of the
depots and switching-tracks of the several
railroads entering tbe city, and ask for legis
lation looking to their removal. The recom
mendations and suggestions contained in
the-report will, I trust, receive the careful
consideration of Congre.
Sufficient time has, perhaps, not elapsed
since tbe reorganization of the government
of the District, nnder tbe recent legislation
ot Congress, for the expression ot a confident
opinion as to its successful operation; but
the practical results already attained are so
satisfactory that the friends of the new gov
ernment may well urge upon Congress tbe
wisdom of f ts continuance, without essential
modification, until, by actual experience, its
advantages and defects may be more fully
ascertained.

A Singular Method of CourtiHjr.
Among the Turkomans of Central
Asia, who may fitly be styled the
Comanches of tbe East, the ancient and
much discussed usage of " marriage by
capture" takes the form of a very singu
lar game, which is, universally popular
with the tribes of the Lower Oxus. IiEs
known by the curious appellation of
"kok-buri" (green wolf), a name
which has never been satisfactorily ac
counted for. The mode of playing is as
follows: When a Turkoman belle finds
herself embarrassed by a crowd of rival
suitors, her father settles the matter by
assembling them all in a convenient
Clace on the open steppe. He then
rings out his daughter arrayed in the
pomp of Turkoman "full dress," and
setting her upon a swift horse places in
her hands the carcass of a lamb or kid,
well greased from head to tail, with
which she instantly gallops away. The
young gentlemen follow her at full
speed, and endeavor to snatch the prize
from her hands, any one who can suc
ceed in doing so being thereby entitled
to consider himself " the happy man."
It sometimes happens, of course, that
when the cavalier who is the object of
the young lady's secret preference
comes within arm's length, she will
hold the kid in such away that he can
easily wrest it from her; but shonld a
less favored suitor overtake her, she
grasps it with all her strength, and the
Hi-starred lover gets but a good roll in
the sand for his pains. When all is
over the father regales the whole com
pany with a sumptuous feast of rice and
mutton suet, for which he afterwards
" sends in the bill " to his future son-in-law,
who is often any thing but flatter
ed by this extensive compliment.
Cotton Culture la California
Cotton culture, which is supposed to
be a failure, is about to take on a new
life in California. The Strong Brothers
announce that they only temporarily
abandoned it because there was no
market, and transport was exceedingly
high. They declare their intention to
resume planting. But the South Pacific
Bail has opened much better lands in
better climate for long staple. There
the night temperature is not so low as
t- materially affect the continuity oi the
day growth, which causes the short
fiber. The silkworm for this reason
makes short-fibered thread, and all our
timber is brash. To this nnevenness
moralists trace the hops and skips in
our temperament on this coast. How
ever close to consummation to-day, to
morrow your bargain's off. Nothing
is reliable till yon hold it fast.' It is
Uns that makes stock gambling so pre
carious here. The stock market is short
fibered. It has no continuity. Prices
may be spinning upwards when sudden
ly the thread of speculation snaps and
lets down scores of gamblers into bank
ruptcy without any reason but the short
fiber of climatic temperament. San

A Merchant of Blngfcamten, IT. T., Insures
Ills life for S3O.O0O, and Then, It Is
Charged, Slowly Caaaes His Own Death.
From the Hew Tork Herald. J
The officers of the various life insur
ance companies of this city were startled
yesterday by the announcement of. the
death of Mr. Walton Dwight, of Bing
hamton, N. Y., that gentleman having
just secured insurance of his life for a
vast sum exceeding $50,000. The
circumstances connected with the case
are so peculiar and the sum involved so
larse that it bids fair to become the
most celebrated of many alleged at
tempts to impose upon life insurance
companies.
Mr. Walton Dwight was one of the
most prominent citizens of Binghamton.
and the "Dwight Block" and the
" Dwight Hotel" are well known all
over the country. Mr. Dwight, it is al
leged, expended his fortune in the erec
tion of these buildings. When the fall
in real estate came ne suffered heavy
losses, and last summer was bankrupt.
In the latter part of September he ap
plied for insurance in several .life com
panies, and was willing to take policies
for almost any amount, but insisted that
all the premium payments should be
made due quarterly. In less than three
months he succeeded in securing poli
cies to the extent of 25C,000 in favor of
his wife and son, and he applied to near
ly every insurance company in the Unit
ed States. The following companies
were reported yesterday as having is
sued policies to him :

The United States Life Company of this
city was the first to become alarmed at
the vast amount of insurance Mr.
Dwight was accumulating. His name
was becoming famous in fife insurance
circles, but he seemed to be a hale and
hearty man, and answered all questions
frankly. Tne United States Life exam
ined his career, and found he had been
sick and suffering from hemorrhage of
the lungs. An agent was sent to Bing
hamton, who saw Mr. Dwight and ask
ed him if he ever had bleeding of the
lungs. He answered in the affirmative,
but said he did not think the matter of
sufficient importance to say any thing
about it when he filled out his applica
tion for insurance. The agent inform
ed him that he had not made a truthful
report of his physical condition and that
tne company would at once cancel nis
policy, but return him the full amount
of the premium he had paid, with inter
est to date.
NOT TO BE BULLDOZED.
Dwight refused the offer, and said he
was not to be bulldozed by the insur-
ance companies. Mr. Dwight had then
just returned from a protracted tour
with his gun in the woods on a damp
and foggy day. He looked very sick
and nervous. Inquiry revealed the fact
that Mr. Dwight the previous day had
stripped off his clothing and swam
across the Susquehanna River four
times ; that he rambled about the woods
day after day without food, and was en
deavoring in every possible way to ruin
his health. These facts were made
known to the life insurance companies,
and there was a rush to Binghamton of
doctors and detectives. Before any
other company, however, could tender
him his money or cancel his policy, Mr.
Dwight died of reported hemorrhage of
the lungs.
LIFE COMPANIES THEORIES ABOUT
DEATH.
The theories of the life companies is
that Mr. Dwight made up his mind to
terminate his life within three months.
No company received a second pre
mium, all the payments were quarterly,
and as soon as he obtained all the in
surance possible he began to destroy his
life ; that, finding that he was likely to
live until the second premiums became
due, he hastened his death by poison.
Yesterday the insurance men held a
hasty consultation, and sent two physi
oians to hold a post-mortem examina
tion of the remains, and the stomach
will be secured for medical analysis. It
appears that Mr. Dwight's family phy
sician has been prescribing arsenic for
his patient for the jjast three weeks;
consequently, if that poison were found,
it wonld be no indication that he had
committed suicide by poisoning.
A BONANZA FOB LAWYERS.
A long le gal contest in any event will
ensue. Already Mrs. Dwight is report
ed to have secured the services of Orlan
W. Chapman, late State Superintendent
of Insurance, to press her claims against
the companies.
There is some uncertainty in regard
to the $10,000 policy in the Mutual Life
of this city. That company is said to
have made ont the policy, and that
Dwight returned it and asked for a
$30,000 policy, and that the Mutual then
refused to issue any. How the nutter
was definitely settled could not be ascer
tained last evening.
In the Germama Life the deceased
had a paid-up policy. A few weeks since
he went to the company's office and
took out an .increased amount of in
suranceall his paid-up policy wonld
pay for.
Mr. Dwight was 41 years of age and
a man of fine personal appearance. The
amount be has paid to the various com
panies for premiums aggregates $3,100.
Two or three Hartford Companies, not
in the above list, are said to be among
the victims.
OPINION Or DWIGHT'S NEIGHBORS.
Binghamton, N. Y., November 20.
The rumor about a fraudulent plot
against life insurance companies by the
late Col. Walton Dwight is regarded
here as unfounded. His death was un
doubtedly caused by gastric fever of
malarial origin.
Some think the diphtheria is of recent
origin, but it isat. The Baptists have,
had the dip theory ever since they start
ed. Cincinnati Saturday Night.
