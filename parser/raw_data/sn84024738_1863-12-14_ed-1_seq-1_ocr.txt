liberally and punctually paid; and It may be added
that by ho people were the burdens Incidental to a I
great war more cheerfully borne. J
The receipts during the year from all sources, I
Including loans and tha balance in the Treasury at
Uie commencement, were #90i,155,6?4 86, and the
_6f regate disbursement #865.796,630 65, leaving a

It Is sufflcient to say here that it Is not believed
that actual results will exhibit a state ,of the

THB BBBBLLIOB.
When Congress assembled a year ago tbe war
bad already lasted twenty months, and there bad
been many conSicts on both land aud sea, with
varying results. The rebellion had been pressed
back into reduced limits; yet the tone of public
feeling aud opinion at home and abroad was not
satisfactory. Willi other signs tbe popular elec
tions, then just passed,, indicated uneasiness !
among ourselves, while, amid much that waa cold
aad menacing, the kindest words coming from Eu
rope were uttered in accents of pity that we were '
too blind to surrender a hopeless cause. Our com
merce was suffering erectly by a few armed ves
sels—built upon and furnished from foreign shores
—aad we were threatened with such additioas
from the aame quarters as would eweep our trade
from tbe sea and raise our blockade. We had
foiled to elicit from European Governments nny
thing hopeful upon thla subject.
VBB BUtMCir-TIOM rBOCLAUATIO**. I
The preliminary emancipation 'proclamation, Is- '
wed In September, waa running lv assigned pe
riod to the beginning of the new year. A month
later ihe final proclamation came, Including the
announcement that colored men of suitable condi
tion woald be received ia the war service. Tbe
policy of eaaaaelpatioa aad of employing Mack
soldiers gave to the future a new aspect, about
which hope, and fear, aad doubt, contended In un
certain conflict. Accordlßf to oar political sys- ;
tern, as a matter of clvU adminietraUon the Gov- ,
ernme.it had no lawful power to effect emanelpa- :
lion In any State, and for a long time It had been
hoped tbat the rebellion could be suppressed with
out resorting to It as a military measure. It was '
ati tbe while deemed possible that tbe necessity
for It might come, and that If It should the cri-ls .
of the contest would than be presented. It came.'
and. aa was anticipated, was followed by dark and .
doubtful days.

Tbe ptopesed acquiescence of the national Ei
ccutlve In any reatonsblr temporary Blate arrange
ment for the freed people le made with the view
of poaalbly modifying the confusion aad destitn
tlon which must at beet attend all classes by a to
.' tal revolution of labor throughout whole States.—
It Is hoped that the already deeply afflicted people
In those States may be somewhat more ready to
give up the cause of their affliction, If to this ex
tent this vital matter be left to themselves, while
no power of the national Executive to prevent an
abuse is abridged by the proposition. *
The suggestion In the proclamation as to main
taining the political framework of the States, on
what Is called reconstruction, Is made in the hope
that it may do good without danger of harm. It
will save labor and avoid great confusion. But
why any proclamation now upon this subject f—■
The subject Is beset with the conflicting views
tbat the atep might be delayed too long, or be
taken too soon.
In some States the elements for resumption seem
ready for action, hut remain Inactive, apparently
for vjant of a rallying point—a plan of action.—
Why should A adopt the plan of B, rather than B
that of A ? And if A and B should agree, how can
they know but that the General Government here
will reject their plan ? By tbs proclamation a plan
is presented which may be accepted by them as a
I rallying point, and which they are assured In ad
: vance will not he regretted here. This may bring
them to act sooner than ■ hey otherwise would.
I The objection to a premature presentation of a
plan by the National Executive consists in tho
. danger of committal on points which coull be
' more safely left to further deveiopm. .ts. Care
has been taken to shape the movement as to avoid
, embarrassment from this source, saying tbat on
certain terms certain claases will be pardoned,
with rights restored. It Is not said that other class
ea or other terma will.never be included, saying
I that reconstruction will be accepted If presented
jln a specific way. It Is not said It will never bo
{ -ccepied In any other way. The movements by
i State action lor emancipation In several of the
States not included in the emancipation proclama
tion are matters of profouud gratulation.

MAW.
And, while I do uot repeat In detail what 1 have
heretofore ao earnestly urged upon this subject, my
feaeral views and feelings remain unchanged ; and
trust that Congress will omit no fair opportunity
of aiding these important steps to the great con
summation. In the midst of other cares, however
Important, we must not lose sight of the fact that
tbe war power Is still our main reliance. To that
power alone can we look for a time to give confi
dence to the peopte in tbe contested regions that
1 the insurgent power will not again overrun them.
Until that confidence shall be established little can
be done anywhere for what is called reconstruc
' tlon. Hence our chlefest care mu-t still be directed
to the army and navy, which have thus far borne
their harder part so nobly and well; jo nd It may be
' esteemed fortunate that, in giving the greatest effi
ciency to these Indispensable arms, we do honora
bly recognise the gallant men, from commander to
; sentinel, who compose them, and to whom more
than to others tbe world must stand ludebted lor

The New York Herald does not think Lincoln.--
message a very hopeful affair ia its plana, ft
rays:
But PresMeut Lincoln wishes It tn be under
stood that In offering this plan of restoration it
does not follow that it is irrevocable, or may not
ho set aside for some better plan. Indeed, he sug
gests that the rebellious States atay return through
the door of Congrrn, hut that Congress alone can
determine when and how that door is to he opened
We conclude tbat Mr. Lincoln's plans will be a
failure, and it la quite possible* tbat It baa been
submitted more with a view to open the question
of an amnesty and a restoration, or more to concil
iate the radicals, than from any hope of the accept
ance of these overtures by tbe States concerned,
or any one of them not under tbe absolute control
of our armlet.
We are now adrift at tea beyond our ancient
landmarks, and upon what shore we may reach the
anchorage 0 f peace it would be vain to conjec
ture. We cau only hope that from the very agita
tion which tbe restoration plan nf the laeeaage will
create we may reach some satisfactory "half-way
house of rest."

They are having a terrible excitement lv New
York. The steamer Chesapeake, Capt. Wllletts,
which lelt New York Saturday evening for Port
land, Me., was captured twenty miles North of
Cape Cod Monday morning, about 1 o'clock, by
Confederate* iv disguise, who had taken passage
en ber. bhe Ik a splendid steamer of 460 tons
burthen, and carries two guns. She Is very fast,
and Is the same vessel that chased, and captured
Lt. Beed, of tbe Tacony, who had captured the
revenue cutter Cashing. A telegram from St.
Johns, N. 8., says:
The steamer Chesapeake, C.ipt. Wllletts, from
New York for Portland, Me., was taken possession
of on Sunday morning last, between 1 and 3 r'elk,
by sixteen rebel passengers. The second engineer
ol the steamer was ahot dead nnd his body thrown
overboard. The first engineer was shot in the chin,
but was retained on b.. .ni. The first mate waa
badly wounded in the groin. Eleven or twelve
shots were fired at the caj. ..iiu.
Afttr being overpowered,the captain was put
Into irons, and the passengers were notified that
they were prisoners of war to the Confer -ate
States of America. The eteamercame to oil Par
tridge Island at about 1 o'clock this morning. The
crew and passengers, except the first engineer,
were put on board a boat and sent to this city.—
The steamer then sailed in an easterly direction,
and was subsequently seen alongside another ves
hcl It is supposed that she took on board a sup
ply of coal from ber.
Tho attack took place about twenty one miles
east of Cape Cod. Captain Willetu and tbe pas
sengers per the Chesapeake are now at tbe Man
sion Mouse. The steamer and cargo were valued
at ons hundred and eighty thousand dollars. Tbe
steamer sailed from New York ou Saturday at 4
o'clock P. M., and was one ol the regular line
plying between New York and Portland.
The New Yerk Herald bas the following nddi
tlonal particulars of the capture:
Prom all we cau learn there were only seven
passengers who purchased passage tickets for Port
land. Me., while a doaen or more persons, dressed
shabbily, some as returned soldiers, weut on boird
aud purchased their tickets of the clerk of-the
boat. This aot being an unfrequent method of do
lug business, of course would not create any sus
picions either In tbe mind of the clerk or c.ptain-
Autpng the aeven passengers who obtained their
tickets at the office was one person wbo stated to
tbe clerk tbat he was an old sea captain, and pre
ferred this ode of reaching Portland on acoount
of IU being the pleaaaulest and cheapest. Be
fore she atarted some fifteen persona were counted
on ber deck; bat evea at the ofllce nothing was
thought of it.
She was fuU of freight, consist _g of cotton, rags,
provisions and general merchandise. She only
carries about thirty tons of coa', which Is enough
to last ber for the round trip, and had aot more
than three days' coal at the Ume of ber capture, ao
that the rebela cannot get very far with ber. She
carried two guna, six-pounders, one brass and tbe
other Iron, several revolvers, and some other fire
arms.
It Is not known whether there waa any powder
on board, but II Is supposed there was not mucli.—
Her calls are email aud cannot be depended upon.
There waa no war risk, and tbe value of the vessel
is over sixty thousand dollars. It is not known
whether tbe cargo was Insured. The Captain Is
expected to arrive here to-day, and then tbe full
particulate will be obtained.
The steam propeller Chesapeake waa owned by
H. B. Cromwell, of this city, and waa*a splendid
vessel in every respect. She was battt in 1853, by
J. A. Weetervelt, was 486 tons burthea.aud eleven
feet draft of water, built of oak, schooner rigged,
and bad a direct scene engine of two hundred
horse power, one cylinder of forty Inches, and
forty-two Inch pletoa. She baa always been a
popular boat ea tbla rqate.
The Chesapeake carried a crew of about twenty
persons, who were, no doubt, sa scattered through
out tbe vessel that tbey did net have tlaae to col led
aad retain poeaeaalon nf the steamer.
The Navy Department was greatly exercised
aver this capture. The Agawam, froat Portland*
tbe Vicksburg, Grand Gulf, Behago, aad Dawn,
from New York, aad the Tlconderoga aad Hen.
drlck Hudson, from Boston, were all to sail on
Monday In chase of the daring raiders.

Oca. Hardee Is a native of Appling, tn the Bute
of Georgia* He graduated at West Point In !8_B;
reared nnder Gen Taylor in Florida, as Lieutenant
commandtngthe Sd Dragoons, and also under Oen
Scott In Mexico, helqg present at all the great bat
tles, he ao distinguished himself for skill and gal
lantry Ihat he waa twice breveted. He wss subse
quently commissioned to visit Ruiope for toe pur
pose of perfecting tactlce, aad we have the result tn
his well known work oa the subject. He waa neat
appointed commandant at VV.st Point, and occu
pied that position when Part Sumter surrendered
in 1861. On the happening ef this Important event,
he resigned from the United rJtn.es service, return
ed ti Georgia, and waa placed next in command to
Cen Twlgga Shortly afterwards he was appointed
by President Davis ser lor Colonel in the regular
set vice of the Confederacy, and placed ia command
at Port Morgan, Georgia. He bad not occupied
this position many months when be was appointed
Brigadier, and sent to Arkansas, where he organ
lied the troops in that State In October. 1861, he
marched with the army be had organised te Bow
ling Green, and earned perennial laurels at Corinth,
Shfloh and Farmlngton, when be waa promoted to
the rank oT Major General. In Oetohar, 1861, he
fought at PerryvHle with such distinguished valor
that he was made a Lieutenant General Prom
thla brief record of bis servlcee aa a military man
the public will be justified In placing the utmost
confidence In the Judgment, skill, aud military
ability of Gen Hardee.
LOCAL MATTERS.
Desertion and Insanity.— One of the moat
distressing cases that we have ever had occa
sion to notice, was brought before the May
or on Saturday last We aljude to a young
woman, badly dressed and covered in dirt,
who had been arrested on charge of iusanity.
dome twelve or eighteen months ago, this
poor creature, then the hand-tome, educated,
intelligent and accomplished daughter of a
wealthy gentleman in Southwestern Virgi
nia, became the bride of a miserable adven
turer, against' the wishes and entreaties of
her parents, and leaving home and its com
forts, started out in the world to brave its
storms with the roan of her choice. A few
months satisfied tbe husband that he was not
to reach tbe money chests of the father, even
through the love of the daughter, nnd be
grew tired of her, treat' ;1 ber brutally, and
finally deserted her, leaving ber no means of
support. Not willing to return to the pa
rental roof from which she had voluntarily
tied, and being unable to procure the neeea
tariea of life by her education and talents,
the heart-broken young wife became the vie
tim of another deceiver, and joining her for
tunes with his, assumed his name aud appa
rently participated in hia vices. Alter a so
journ of some months in Richmond the gay
but unhappy criminal found herself once
more deserted and thrown upon the cold
charities of an unforgiving world. Seeing
then the depths of her degradation—feeling
that she had obliterated all right to the pro
tection of her relatives—and knowing that
She had forever destroyed the kind sympa
thies of the truly virtuous of her own sex,
she became a wanderer and an outcast, a
prey to remorse, and an object of loathing
and disgust Thus situated her mind gave
way under its load of oppression, and she
was found atrolling along one of the roads
between this city aud Lynchburg, destitute
of everything valuable but life. A party of
gentlemen who saw and re.oir_l_.ed her had
ci placed in the custody of me Mayor, and
he has undertaken the kind office of corres
ponding with her friends aud soliciting their
sympathy and aid in her behalf. We have
omitted the names of parties, to avoid* adding
freah wounds to the already laacerated and
bleeding hearts of the young woman's fami
ly—but may we not hold up ber fate as a bea
con light to others of her sex to warn them
of the shoals and breakers which ever line
tbe track of those wbo dteregard the advice
of more experienced friends, and blindly dis
obey parental commands t
Charge of Theft.— William Mull has bean
arrested and committed to the cage on the
charge of stealing one pair of boots, one pair
of pants, one pair of drawers, two shirts, one
vest, one coat, one pair of socks, ten pounds
of butter, and a lot of fruit, bread, and ap
ples, all valued at 1230, the property of Ja*.
Leach. Patrick Lee waa also arrested and
caged, charged with being concerned with
Mull. What tha evidence will prove, re
mains to be seen; but the friends of tha pria
onera think the sffslr will prove nothing
more than a breach of trust at farthest.
The Mayor, on Saturday morning, had a
large docket fo dispose of, but none of the
cases called possessed any public interest.—
Several parties were fined for keeping open
doors on the Sabbath—others for selling in
toxicatirg beverages after 10 o'clock at night;
and others, for allowing their sons to plsy
at bandy In tha streets, contrary to law. The
black list waa a very large one, made up of
petty thefts, want of passes, fighting end
drunkenness, which ware heard and disposed
of as the law directs.
Banket* are much needed by the soldiera
In general service, and comfortable over
coats are In greet demand in several regi
ments In the Army of Northern Virginia.—
Every county, city, town, and nelgbborhoou
should see that its soldiers am prr>mptly
supplied with all tha neceaaariea forjt long
and severe winter campaign. Where bian
keta cannot be had. good coverlids msy be
made of old carpets, aad bedqnilts win prove
very acceptable to those who have nothing
better. The army may now be said to have
gone into winter quartera, and every man In
it is no doubt tryiug to accumulate cotaforta
for the chilling months before btm.
