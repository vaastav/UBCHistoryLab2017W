'THE PRESIDENT'S
rMESSAGE
HAVB you rtfrnl Vresldcnt Hard
Iiir's mtssaRO to congress? It
Ii well wortti more limn tlio cursory
reaillnc that Iho writer lias so far
been able to kIvo It. It Is worth
the. close attention and study of
very cltlicn.
It takes ui. and calls for action
upon, half a doten vital questions.
If (tieso problems vera seltlHl, and
stilled rUht. America, and, the
roflil, would bo nearer harmony
nrTd peae0 by a Reed many steps
than thry are today. Kor It Amor
lea'bad her own houso In order and
could brluR to bear upon world
p'tobloros a united purpose, sho
could wluld a tremendous Influ
ence. Ilut until our own crave
domestic concerns aro arranged to
general satisfaction, wo cannot ex
pect to exert much Influence, nor
should wo, upon too affairs of our
neighbors.
First of all, and It Is so pointed
to by President Harding, comes the
weal of thfl farmers, who aro now
In a bad "ay tho nation over. The
Imrocdlhto romedy advocated by the
president Is enlarged and longer
term credit through extended farm
loan bureau powers.
' But the farmer cannot bo made
permanently prosperous through en
larged borrowings, says tho na
tldn'a exocutlve and his words
show a wisdom bospeaklng study
and understanding that show htm
to, be a broader and bigger man
titan the majority have yet given
bin') credit for being, even among
his own party,
tThe farmer must be glvon an
earning power lu proportion to the
Importance of his Industry, so that
jjfli'can pay back uhut bo Is forced
to. borrow. He must be released
from the handicap of Inadequate
transportation.
wit takes courago to stand up and
tell tho transportation magnates
that their systems arc broken down,
litclr rolling stock worn and In
adequate, In the faco of their fran
tic dcclarntlcns that everything Is
all rlicbt. Harding. In seeking Jus
tice for tliu unorganised tillers of
tbu soil, Is criticizing a strongly
intrenched and organized Interest.,
.'.It Is not what one would cxpoct
fr'otn a politician. It marks more a
statesmanlike understanding of tho
necessities; without regard for 1m
jfbfitlcal effect upon a second term.
The Immigration question, Amer
icaniiatlon and th" need of a child
labor amendment aro all big prob
lem's, and are so treated in tho
message, but transportation that
will actually aid tho producers, and
udeqnsto enforcement of tho pro
hibition law aro the Imminent prob
lems, and nro thus recognized by
tiuiy president.
';All good cltlzons will agrco with
their president that Is humiliating
to sea tho law of tho land flouted,
us It U dally being flouted by men
and women of high station, as well
as tho degraded and criminal, alike
III', tho hamlet and the metropolis
all over the land.
The contempt shown for this one
law Is sapping the general respect
for all law.
Out of the conferenco of gov
ernors of tho states with the fed
Ml' executive and his advisers,
which Is proposed by the president,
should come some suggestions. Cer
tainly If tho majority of public
opinion In the United States favors
strict prohibition, there, should be
ri difficulty In enforcing the vr
against a criminal minority. Iiut If
yjm have madu an emotional mis
tte, and mlsguagod our real dos-
IMM, the honest thing to do Is to
admit the truth, repeal tho law, or
roodlfy,ilt, and Indulgo our alcoholic
cravings openly.
V aro in serious danger, Is Pre
sent conditions piovall, of becom
ing olthor a nation of defiant law
breakers, or a national of hypo
crites neither of which conforms
with' the American Ideal.
Bt read the president's message,
