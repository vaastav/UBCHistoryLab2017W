did not think the States bad acted precipitately.
In his judgment number of the States would
secede in six y days.' In South Carolina the

Mr. Hawkins, of Florida, said. "Last Tues

similar reasons I ask to be excused from serving
on this committee. I have considered with
older members as to whether it is voluntary or
not tor a member appointed on a committee to
servo unless excused, and that if he does not
serve he subjects himself to something like re
buke or reprimand on the part of the Hcuse.
Now, as long as 1 am a member of this bedy, 1
am anxious to respect all its rules, and am un
willing to draw upon myself rebuke or repn-
hiarid. I thorerore ask the House to excu e
me from serving on this committee. II 1 am
compelled to serve, 1 wi 1 be a very unimpor

not act with all the committee. ' As to the idea
of getting up i committee with a unanimity of

opposed to anything of tho kind, in the past,
and am now believing that the time for com
rromise ha passed forever.
Mr. John Cochrane, of New York, said that
he had heard, with a great deal of regret, his
h ie nd ask to be excused txou , serving on the
committee. It has been well said lure to day
in the chaplain's prayer, that the gray shadow
of the daik wine of dissolution has been ex
tended over our house and country, and so d-jep
is the gloom that we can scarcely discern one
gleam of light to enable us to transact the ordi

IhjESMAOE.
Washikotoit, Dec. 4.
The President review th history of, the
aati-slaverr movement and aav all thafi
necessary to accomplish tbe object of peace is J
for the slave-holding States to be alone and
manage their own domestic institutions in their
own way. Th mere election of any man
to office is not just cause for a dissolution
of the Union.
Tbe antecedents of the President elect are
calculated to excite fears in South Carolina,
but n the fjnestion of contingent danger suffi
cient td jmniry the ditrnction of the GsvernJ
mcnt? He reviews the acts of the differmt
Northern States in the passage of personal lib
erty bills, and prosources them unconstitu-
tinnal. fie says that it' should not b presum
ed in sdvauce that the President elect will fail
to enforce tbe fugitive slave law, as this mould
lie unjust and eantrary to Christian charity.
Let os wait for -the overt act.' He then de
clares against tne' right of secession," and says'
to admit it the Union might be broken into
fragments, in less than fwo weeks -1
He quotes the language of Jackson and Mad
ison. Secession' is altogether '. founded on sn
infertnre not in the Constitution. The Union
was designed to be peipetual. He then quotes
the Constitution in support of this view. "The
frnmers of the Constitution never intended to
plant in its bosom needs for .its own destruction.
They were not guilty of the absurdity of pro
viding for its own dissolution. The right of
resistance agiinst tyrany and oppression, how
ever, cannot be denied; this right is asserted in
the Declaration of Independence; hut secession
Iw neither more nor less than revolution." lie ;
speaks of the affairs of South Carolina.' fie
does not apprehend th.it an attempt will be!
made to seize the Fort, but if in this he be !
mistaken, the rfficers have orders to act strict-1
ly on the defensive. Let the responsibility rest
on the heads of those who provoke the contest, I
lie invokes his countrymen to pause before j'
attemp'ing to destroy the Union whioh has;
conferred so many benefits. He argues that
Congress can do much to restore peace, by pro-'
,otiing and recommending an amendment to
the Constitution for remedying the existing
evils. The very cause he recommends is to
have an explanatoryclau.se 01 amendment of,
the slavery question; First, expressly rccog- 1
nizing the right of property in slaves in States
where slavery now or may hereafter exist; sec-
ondly, tfie duty 'of protecting Rich rights in alt
the coiuiag Tcrrlleries until the latter are ad- j
tnittcdas States into the Union. 1
Thirdly, like recognition of the right of ter- j
ritories to decide for or against slavery when ;
they come to form a State Constitution. , . I
This does not proceed solely from the claim '
on the part of Congress, or Territorial Legisla
tures to exclude slavery from the Territories,
nor from the efforts of the different States to
defeat the execution of the fugitive slave law,
but the immediate peril arises from Incessant
and violent agitation of the slavery question
thriughout the North, for the last quarter of a
centuary, has-produced its malign influence 011
the slaves and inspired them with vague notiohs
of freedom. ' Hence asense ofsecurit, no long
er exists around the family altar,, the feeling of
peace at home has given place to apprehension
of servile insurrection. .
Many a matron throughout the South retires
at night, in dread of what may befall herself
and children before the morning. Should this
apprehension of domestic danger extend and
intensify, until it shall pervade the masses of'
the Southern people, then disunion will be in-1
evitable. Self-preservation is the first Uw of
nature, and no political union, however fraught
with blessings and benefits in all other respects,
can long continue, if the necessary copsequence
be to render homes and firesides of nearly one
half the parties to it, habituahy and hopelessly
insecure.' Sooner or later the bonds of such a
union must be severed- ,.',, . '-, -.,
. It is my conviction that this fatal period has
not yet arrived," After referring to the inces
sant agitation against slavery at the North for
lb!' past 25 years, both by the , press and the
people, and asserting that thq time of Congress
is occupied With violent speeches on this never
ending subject, he remarks how easy would it
be for the American peoplo to settle the slavery
quesvion; forever and restore peace and harmo.
ny te this distracted country, whichcan be done
by letting1 the Rla'va States alone, and permit
ting them to manage their own State affairs as
they only are responsible be fore. God for slavery
existmg among them, and with which the
Sorth'htrS' no more right to interfere than wi h
similar intlfu'ions in- Russia or Brazil. ' ' ;
; The President still relies on the good sense
and forbearance of the people, alleging it is in
the power of sny ' President to accomplish hut
little, which leads him to observe that the
election of any one of our fetjow-cjitiMns o th?
office of President, does not of itself afford jut
omse for dissolving the Union. The lata elec
tions'! aye been held In Strict eohforulity with
the provisions pf the 'jCoustjtationJ "fle does
not ju-Hify revplutjon , to dsstroy this very
Constitution. IWason, justice and h regard for
the Constiiutioh all require that we shall wait
'or some overt and dangerous act on the' par); of
the President eloct, before rosortiiig to such a
remedy j r; :lri ..'-:,-,: . jir ".
" 'Hit.' Buchanan Tefers-'to the 1adt that the
President's1 province 'is not to tnake,' but to exa

cession is neWier more no? less than revolution.
It may or it ntivy.. n-t be justifiable' revolution -but
still It is a revolution.- AVhat in the mean
tithe is the ropdnsfb"ility snd true position ot
the Executive? He is bound to take care that
he laws are faith fully executed, and from this
obligation he tsartnot be absolved by any human
prwer. ' "- ,.'.'''1" ' ...-;-.''. ';
But what if the performance of this duty in
whole or in part has beerf rendered impractical
bio by events oer which te could have exer
cised no control? Such, at the present mo
ment, is the c ise throughout the fctat of South
Carolina, si) fur as the laws of the United States
to secure the administration of justice by means
of Federal judiciary are concerned.' All the
Federal officers within its limits,' through whose
agency alo'o those law" can be carried into ex
ecution, have already resigned. Wq- no longer
have a District Judge, a District Aitorney,' or
aM-aishal in South-'Carolina.- ' r - U
In fact the whole niaohinery of tlie Federal
Government necessary 'for' the distribution of
radical justice among lb people has been de
moralized, arid it would be difficult, if not im
possible, to replace 'It. ""TlnVbhly acls ol Con
gress in the Stitiito bbok-) bearing on this sub
ject are those of the 28th of Fehrtuary, 1705.
an 1 the 3d of March,' 1807. These "authorize

. It. is not boiievei that any attempt; will be
made to' expel1 tte fnited States frouj Its pro
perty there by force; hilt if in this I should
prove rto be mistaken, oflieers in cpmmand ol
forts have recieved orders . to actjtrictly on the
defensive. In su,ctl a'cqntingericy the resp'onsj.
bilit-y , for, the consequences .would rightfully
rest upon the heads of assailants. " In'referenco
to'recogtiizing a secessiob State as an indepen
dent government by the y President, he.' says it
would be a naked bit of usurpation on his part,
and it.is his "fluty" to submit, to Congress "whole
the qaestion in alt its toaripga." " The probabili
ty of an emsrgency. soon " arising" when Congress
will be called on to'detjide the qiiestipri wheth"

It is manfest that this is not ; among specific
and qunMrated powers gramsd jo! pongress,
and it is equilly apparent that its cxercis is
not necessary and proper for, carrying ioto'exe-,
cution soy ppe of these powers., l'he President
eclsre that to .make war upon 11 ,! st
variance with the spirit of tho Constitution, and",
having conquered SUto bow, arc w to goirorn ,
it? Wr could eot govern it by despotic power
nor could w ty physicical fore compel
it
people to elect a Senat and Representative.
Th tact Is, the Union rests upon public opin-
i'Hi, and Can never beemotd bv th blood pf
its eitisess, she in civil war. If it cannot live
in the aSect:on of th people it must one day
perch, v Congress possesses many ' means of
preserving it ty conciliation, but th sword is
not placed in htr hands to preserve it by fore.
But may I be permitted solemnly to invoke
my countrymen to pause and deliberate before
they determine to destroy this, th grandest
tctfiple which has ever teen dedicated to hu
nSan freedom since the world began. It has
been consscrated by th blood of our fathers,
by the glories of the past,nd by the hopes of
ths future. . . , " ","'.'
The Union jjas already made us Uie rnost
prosperous, and long will, if prt served, render
us, the most powerful nation on the Oco of (he
earth." In every foreign region of the gtcbe the
title 4) f an. American citTzen' is lield in the
highest respect, and when "pronounced in for
eign land it causes the hearts ' of our country
men to swe'.l with honest prida. Surely, when
we reach the trink of the yawning abyss.'we
shall recoil with horror from the fatal pjunge,
Hy such a dread catastrophe hi hojws of the
friends of freedom througheut the world would
be destroyed, and. a.hjrvg pight of leaden des
potism would enshroud Hie nations, . ,
Our example for" tnore than eighty years'
would not only, be lost, but it would te quoted
S3 a concJu-iive proof that man is unfit for self
goverpnient. ih slavery question, use every
thing, humanwil! have its day. 1 ,firmiy be
lieve that.it has already reached and passed its
culminating point; but if, in the midst of the
existing excitement, the Union shall pensb,
the evil may then become irreparable.
Congress, can contribute much to avert it by
proposing ,and recommending to the legisla
tures of the several Spates the remedy for the
existing evils, which the Constitution has it
self .provided for its own preservation. ,,
The President proposes that his explanato
ry ainendrsent, to the Constitution be adopted
by Congress for the final settlement of the trus
construction of, be constitution. jOn three spe
cil points; an tspresrecognition. of the right
of property , in slaves In fttntes where it now
exists or may hereafter exist, the duty of pror
tccting this right in U tlie poinmon, territories
throughout their, territorial existence,, and un
til t):ey shall Ve admitted astates in the Union
with or without slavery as their constitutions
may prej
A like'recognition pf the right of the master
to havs his slave, who has, escaped from one
slave law, enacted, for lm. purpose, together
with a declaration that all S:ate laws impairing
or defeating this, right, , are violations of the
Consntution and are consequently null and, void.
. Such an, explanatory amendment would, jt is
believed, fqreyer. terminate the exinting dissen-,
tions and. restore peace and .harmony among
the States. The President then discusses' our
foreign relations. . Our foreign relations with
Spain have been complicated by the refusal of
the Senate to ratify a convention for the ad
justment of .certain claimsso called.. , .
The President reiterates his recommenda
tion for the acquisition of Cuba by a fair pur
chaser -W-Hhthe exception of Mexico; our re--
lations are gonerally o( a satisfactory character.
In relation to Kansas the Presid nt says
"A desperate band, recently assembled, under a
notorious outlaw, in the, Southern portion, of
the Territory, to resist the execution of laws,
and to plunder peaceabie citizens, will, I doubt
not, be speedily subdued and brought to jus
tice.", . . , , , , ,'.".. ". . .. , '", "
He recommends a Pacific Railroad, congratu .
lates the country jiipon the, apparent diininu
tion of the slave trade snd tbe fillibustcring scn
timent. And in viewpfthe destitution in
Kansas, recommends, to Conjress that if any
constitutional raaasures of reliefcan ba devised
that subjoct should be duly ensidereds ( ...
