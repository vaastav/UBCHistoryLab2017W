flEVi SEfiATE ELEVATOR.
THE TOPEKA DAILY . STATE JOUBN.AE- TUESDAY . EVENINGitDECElIBEB 4,1900.
"Work Commenced on Installation of
Modern und Safe Conveyance.
A work vts started at the state house
today which will be hailed with joy by
the Kansas legislators when they as
semble here, and particularly by those
of senatorial proportions. A new ele
vator of the moet modern Otis type is
being installed In the shaft in the south
east corner of the rotunda.
For a number of years past the ele
vator in this shaft has been frowned
upon by everyone who was not fond of
the salubrious exercise of walking up
several flights of stairs to reach legisla
tive and other levels. It has been con
sidered unsafe and was more than un
attractive after the new elevator had
been put in in the southwest corner and
which runs up on tho rej.resentative sidu
of the house. As a matter of fact
the east elevator only would run oc
casionally, when it took the notion, and
It was out of commission more than
half of the time during the session of
the legislature two years ago, and at
the close of this session it has not
even earned storage room by making
a Hingis trip.
The new elevator in west corner had
to bear the brunt of the work all last
session in carrying the solons to and
from places of heavy thought and light
work. This elevator really had mere
work than it could do and it was par
ticularly annoying to the majesties of
the senate to be compelled to cross the
rotunda in order to go above and there
by lose lots of time in reaching their
destination, and perforce be compelled
to rub elbows with the humbler herd
of the houi,e.
But al Itnis will be changed this year.
A most modem elevator is being in
stalled in the eastern shaft, which will
provide the convenience needed bv the
v..enators and which will carry them
Hvith safety and dignity to their realms
above.
There is no doubt about the old ele
vator, which is being torn out, having
been a dangerous vehicle of ascent and
descent. A few years ago it took a
tumble one day when it was filled with
persons, but luckily the brakes caught
before it reached the bottom, and no
one was seriously injured. On this
momentous trip a young man distin
guished himself by jumping headfirst
out of an open door passed on the way
down. He landed on the lloor In a
heanand nicked himself up to find that
he uninjured.
GILLETTE WEPT.
Wbs Overcome by the Reading of Ilia
Dcnd Sweetheart's letters
Herkimer, X. T.. Dec. 4. District
Attorney Ward today resumed his
summing up of the case against
Chester E. Gillette, charged with the
murder of Grace Brown. He described
Gillette's life in Cortland as outwardly
correct, but actually lustful, as shown
by the wrong he admitted he had done
Grace Brown.
"Gillette," Ward said, "wanted to
stay in Cortland, in society. He never
intended, never for a moment, to take
Grace Brown anywhere except to her
death. He concocted a plan to rid
himself of her. The girl received her
death blow, I am sure, with a grateful
heart, out there in the woods.
"The cool, clever, courageous scoun
drel," the prosecutor declared, "said
on the stand that he asked Grace
Brown to go "with him on Decoration
day. Ha,UtV Hey-as,offwitli-. girl
to Skaneatels lake that day. A man
can be drilled into a long story to
cover guilt but the lie will come out."
Mr. Ward described Gillette as an
unmitigated coward.
The prosecutor's address was in
tense with feeling. As he read the let
ters of Grace Brown and pointed out
the sentiments that she expressed;
that the writer was a girl of pure
thoughts and in the same breath re
ferred to the defendant as a rat. Gil
lette broke into tears and it was some
time before he was able to regain hia
comi csure.
DOG BLOCKED THE CARS
A. B. Qulnton Came Off Ahead tn a
Controversy About His Canine.
A blockade of half the street cars In

afternoon at the transfer station by A
B. Quinton's dog. The dog and Its mas

to the presence of the dog on the car
but did not undertake to eject the an
imal until the transfer station was
reached. Here the conductor on the car
destined to the Santa Fe depot refuse
to carry the dog without in
structions from his superiors. Mean
time the cars "piled up" behind the
conveyance occupied by the Qulnton
dog. After the street had been filled
with cars for a block or 'so, the conduc
tor decided to go on his way, and Mr
Qulnton and his dog arrived at the San
ta Fe depot in time to catch the trail
for Grover on a short hunting trip.

FOR BAR ASSOCIATION.
Programme for Annual Meeting An
nounced by J. B. Larimer.
In spite of the difficulties under which
he labored. J. B. Larimer, of Topeka,
chairman of the executive council, has
succeeded in arranging a splendid pro
gramme for the next State Bar associa
tion meeting, which same will be held
in Topeka, in the supreme court room,
January 30 and 31. 1907.
The programme, omitting committee
repoits which are to be submitted in
writing, and are as a rule, instructive
and entertaining, is as follows:

attorney genera', of Missouri.
Presidents address L. H. Perkins,
Lawrence.

Reports of committees.
L. B. Kellogg has given much time
and study to probate matters, and un
der special invitation will give an ex
haustive rtport on the subject amount
ing almost to a complete revision of
probate practice and procedure.
Tht- committee on revision of the rode
of civil procedure headed by ex-Associate
Justice S. H. Allen is a strong one
and the understanding is it will intro
duce a complete printed revision of the
code.
The judiciary committees from both
houses of the legislature, which will be
in full swing at that 'time, will be spec
ially Invited to attend the sessions
when the codes are under consideration,

held.
Every lawyer, every property owner,
every prospective property owner in the
state should have direct interest in
these two matters.
XO DOUBT ABOUT THE VERDICT.
Ed G. Moore Talks About His Court
Martial by G. A. K.
Ed G. Moore of this city, who was
tried recently by a G. A. R. court mar
tial on charges looking to have him
dropped from the ranks of that organ
ization, said today, in relation to the
item published in the State Journal last
night concerning his court martial:
"I do not doubt," said Mr. Moore,
"that the court martial has gone
against me. It was organized for that
purpose. But it was incorrect to say
that one of the charges was about an
obscene letter which I wrote to Coney.
I never addressed a letter to him in
my life. It was also incorrect to state
that this was the first court martial of
this character in tne annals of the G.
A. R. in Kansas. There have been sev
eral of them and two of them weri
directed against P. H. Coney, himself,
and the charges preferred against him
on these occasions were proven.
"It is perfectly right to say that there
was never another trial in the world
like mine, unless it was the trial of
Jesus Christ. Coney made the charges
against me, Coney appointed the court
and Coney named the judge advocate.
I and Coney is to review the proceedings

PLAYED AT SUICIDE.
Lcla Ttapcr Scared Her Relatives by
Taking a Drink.
Lela Raper, a young woman who
was recently convicted in police court
of keeping a disorderly house, and Is
now under appeal bond, created con
siderable unnecessary excitement this
afternoon by playing at suicide. The
girl lives with her mother on East
Fourth street, and owing to trouble
between mother and daughter, In
which a rocking chair was demolished
and the mother slightly startled, the
son of Mrs. Raper, who is an elder
half-brother of the troublesome girl,
called to settle matters with his sister.
In the row which followed, Lela Raper
took a swig1 from a bottle which she
said contained poison. The brother
immediately telephoned the police,
and a wagon load of officers responded
to see what was the matter. While
the entire family were taking turns
telling their troubles to the officers, a
second consignment of officers and a
herd of reporters arrived in an auto
mobile. These, together with the
crowd of neighbors who had been at
tracted by the appearance of the pa
trol wagon, made a large and en
thusiastic crowd and all because Lela
Raper took a drink of blackberry
cordial.

California Members Are Displeased
With President's Message.
Washington, Dec. 4. President
Roosevelt's discussion of the San
Francisco, school situation in his mes
sage was received with great dissatis
faction by the California delegation in
the house. The members of the dele
gation from that state are unanimous
in their declaration that no treaty
rights have been violated in excluding
Japanese from public schools attended
by white children.
Representative Hayes said that if
any treaty of the United States pre
vents California from runnins its
schools as It sees fit the treaty is
clearly unconstitutional and should
not stand.
A meeting of the California delega
tion will soon be held to discuss the
San Francisco situation.
The suggestion In President Roose
velt's message that naturalization be
extended to Japanese is extremely dis
tasteful to the California delegation in
the house.

Finkelstein Mountford to be given in
the Auditorium on the Bible and the
Holy Land on Thursday evening, Fri
day afternoon and Saturday evening of

HE LIVED 12 HOURS.
After He Had Been Pronounced Dead
by the Doctor.
Chicago, Dec. 4. Victor Ulrici
cheated the death he sought yesterday.
Despite the assertion of a physician
and two assistants that he was dead,
Ulrici drank a glass of water and was
then taken to Mercy hospital where it
is believed he has a "fighting chance
for life." He shot himself in the right
temple, the bullet imbedding itself in
the wall of the room after piercing his
skull. He was found on the floor of
his bedroom, a revolver lying close be
side him.
Despondent because of a love affair,
Ulrici returned from his work at a
brewery and after barricading the door
attempted to end his life. The shot
was heard by Mrs. Rose Berblinger, in
whose home he roomed, and a doctor
was called.
The doctor, Mrs. Berblinger asserted,
seized the apparently dying man and
after dragging him across the room,
probed the wound with his fingers. Al
though the wagonmen from a police
station were standing in the room,
stretcher in hand, the physician assert
ed the man was beyond relief. The
physician departed and the policemen
returned to their station. Mrs. Ber
blinger closed the door of the room and
went about her work. She was terrified
nearly two hours later when she heard
a moan. Running to the door she
threw it open and say Ulrici moving
his hands and calling for water.
Screaming with terror, Mrs. Ber
blinger ran to the street and summoned
a physician. The police were again
notified and Ulrici was hurried to
Mercy hospital where an operation was
performed.
Ulrici died today, survilvng 12 hours
after he had been pronounced dead by
the physician.
