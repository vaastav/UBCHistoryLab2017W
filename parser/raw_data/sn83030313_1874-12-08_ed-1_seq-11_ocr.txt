Wall Street, )
, Monday. Dec. 7?? P. M. f
The stock market In opening to-day was affected
by strong depressing influences. Pacific Mall de
clined from 41X to 39X. Lake Shore, Northwestern
and St. Paul common. Western Union, Wabash,
Onto and ?Mississippi, Rock Island and Brie, all
participated in the downward movement, and it
-was not until the second call that a firmer feeling
waa manifested. Pacific Mail then showed a re
covery of IX per cent, and the improvement in
the remainder of the list ranged irom X to X per
cent. At a later hoar stocks continued firm,
and a confluent feeling was established
concerning; the future course of prices.
Doubtless tbe supposed action of Congress has
bad much to do with the uncertainty of tbe day,
but In the absence of any definite lnlormatlon (tor
the President's Message is not at hand), stocks
are manipulated In the same speculative Interests
that bave controlled recent movements. The
effect of the official recommendations ol tbe
President and Secretary ol the Treasury has not
yet been ielt. and their respective problems are
not jet studied. Hence tbe wise men or Wall
street were not likely to-day to make a response
in any change of prices that could be traced to
this cause. The Pacific Mail directors to-day
?leoteo William H. Fogg a director in the place of
Russell Sage, resigned. Mr. K. Alexandre was
elected president and has accepted.

Whiskey Lower. ^ YORK, Dec. 7,1874.
The markets were still irregular and generally i
dulL The decline in gold had a tendency to uu- j
settle values, still more so that prices were in most
cases nominal. On 'Change flour was steady. |
Wheat was dull but flrin. Cora was neglected,
but with small receipts the market was strong, j
Oats were Irregular, closing active and Arm.
Whiskey was easier. Barley was strong. Pork ,
dull and nominal. Lard easier. Cotton was i
quiet and easier for "spot," but active at a slight
decline for forward delivery. Groceries were j
quiet but steady. Freight* continued strong, both on
the berth and for charter. Petroleum wa. held higher.
Which checked operation*. Naval stores were heglccted
snd nominally lower.
Cottov -The narnet tor cotton on trie spot ruled dull,
