LONGYEAR CASE PUZZLES.
Discovery of Coal In Spitzberge
Raises an International Question,
Senator Lodge has intrinluced a bill
which Involves a delicate international
question, affecting the right of cap!
talists to exploit natural resources
In
territory over which n country extr
cises Jurisdiction. John M. Longyear
i f Drookline. Frtih-rick Ayer of Lowell
and other capitalists are desirous of
developing certain coal deposits in tho
Spitzhergcn Islands, which are claim
ed by no country.
The onlv nuiriiestlon of law cover-
in" such a situation la found in the
guano act of liS6. which provides that
whenever unv citizen of the I nited
States discovers u deposit of guano
on any island, rock or key not within
the lawful Jurisdiction of any otner
govcrntm nt and not occupied by citi
i ns of any other government and
takes peaceable possissioii there
of ami tK-cupies the same,
such Island, rock or key, may ut tho
discretion of the president be con
sidered as appertaining to the I'nited
States.
Such a law was found effective and
adequate in Its application to guano
deposits, which usually are found upon
rocky islands of no intrinsic value,
but the law obviously docs not apply
to coal lands and could hardly be
construed to imply any considerable
seizure of t rritory. As a means of
approaching this new question, Sena
tor Lodge therefore moves to amend
the e,uano act by making It apply to
"coal r other minerals" and enlarging
its scope by extending it to "any por
tion" of the land involved.
In his annual message. President
Taft dealt at Home length with the
anomalous position of the Spitzberg n
islands, and stated that the I'nited
States government, in view of proofs
filed with it in li'iil. has accepted un
der reservation the Invitation of Nor
way to participate in an international
conference relating to the islands.
Tin s.- j. roofs showed the American
pow.i ssioii. occupation and working of
certain coal-bearing1 .mds in Spitz
bergen and the r rvation prescribed
that the question of altering the sta
tus of the islands and countries be
longing to no particular state and as
equally open to the citizens and sub
jects of a'l st.it could not be raised.
The I.olge amendment if adopted1
wo iid tnd to confirm the rights of
M..-srs. Lomryear and Ayfr and their
associates in the coal lands already
occupied.

THE BASEBALL SPIKE AND
Showing bottom of baseball shoo
and Ty Cobb, the player whoso base-
running has done much to mlr up the
agitation against the spike.
Spikes!
This was onef the subjects consid
ered by tho National and American
league baseball magnates yesterday
and today. There is no phase of the
diamond game, that has aroused as
nnich eomniellt ilurlmr the Past two
years. Since the close of the last play
ins season there has been a little letup
in the noise, however, the argument
over the National league presidency
and the discussion of the possibilities
of lessening the dangers of football
coming up and furnishing the fall and
early winter gossip.
Put you remember the noise that
was made over the death-dealing spikes
late in the playing season, when Ty
Cobb dug the steel into Third Dase
man Daker of the Athletics, putting
this player out of the game for a time
at a critical point In the pennant race.
Then came the' subsequent spiking of
Maker by Cobb in the next clash of
Detroit and Philadelphia.
All this brought up tbe' matter of
baseball spikes' with renewed1 interest
and many of the powers of baseball
were ready to 't'cil how' tlie" evil coul.l
be remedied. ' Smite magnates came
out with the suggestion that the rules
committee frame a rule whereby a
player would' be called out If he slid
into a bag feet' first. Other sugges
tions have also' been made to do away
with spikes altogether and find some
substitute, such oa the cleats used In
football.
Dut when nil Is said .afttl ono where
can you find a substitute for the
spikes? Surely not football cleats. It
Is a practice among ball players to file
their spikes, making them as sharp as
possible. Now this Is not done with
the Intention of Intimidating any play
er or of cutting an opposition player.
It Is done for the playor'a own Interest
in tho development of speed and to
reserve his feet. The sharper the
spikes the lcs1' resistance there ia
when it Is dtl'lnto the ground. And
this Is just why 'football cleats would
not work In bft'seball. The feather can
not be brought' (n an edge af vVhh h it
will, not otYo'roslstaiW' to' the turf.
Now what wo'lild happen to' a' baseball,
team wearing" the leather cW-ats? In
hide of two niontha every player would
lo f.i stove hp' that the nospiial lists
would be larger tha'n should the spikes!

lx permitted. Instead of "cold feet."
the. popular malady would be "sore
feet."
What is true of the football cleat
also applies to the rubber knobs or
anything else that might be suggested.
Take away the spikes and baseball
would be robbed of many of its most
brilliant roaturos. Pase running would
be reduced to a minimum, while sensa
tional fielding would be a thing yt the
past. Plays that are now possible
through iulck start gained by Bpikcs
would never be pulled off.
Daseball without tpikes would be a
failure. Then If the spikes are to be
retained, what Is the remedy? Surely
not the head first slide, for under such
conditions the runner would be
placed In a worse position than the
baseman is now. The defensive play
er would block off a man with his knee
without danger to himself, and where
there Is now an occasional cutting,
broken nock, collar bones and such In
juries would be common.
The spike is a big problem In base
ball, but there is little chance to tam
per with the steel and Its use. It will
take a wise man Indeed to devise a
rule that will fulfill the purpose for
which It is Intended.- namely, of pro
tecting players without spoiling the
game.

Strange Stories From New Zea
land About Overland Trips.
Prof. Drutnmond, the New Zealand
naturalist, writing on the subject of
the journeys of animals, observes that
reindeer, foxes, hares, seals, whales,
rats, many Kpoclos of llsh, a few spe
cies of reptiles, and even Insects, un
dertake some very extraordinary mi
grations. In New Zealand the most notable
migrants are birds, but seals are known
to set out on long Journeys and to re
turn to their own homes again; nnd
the migration of the Maori rat. espe

districts, where countless thousands,
led by an Invisible pled piper, swarm
