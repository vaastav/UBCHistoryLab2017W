(THE COEUR D'ALENE PRESS. FRIDAY EVENING. DECEMBER 14. 1906
WILL SETTLE
STATUS OFCHURCH
France to Take Decisive Measures
At Once
Paris, Dec. 14.—The net result of
the uncompromising attitude assumed
by the Vatican seems to be that the
clergv will lose its pensions, 38,300
of which have been granted and ga
zetted since the beginning of the
year: that all aspiran s to the priest
hood will be compelied to perform
military services apd that the taking
over of the episcopal mansions, reo
tories, seminaries, will occur immed
iately instead of in December, 1907.
According to well informed per
sons, the government intends to res
pond to the attitude taken by the Vat
ican by submitting to parliment a
proposition to settle definitely the
status of the church in Prance Un
der this proposal the church will for
feit all benefits under the law of
1905, but it is to be provided with
an opportunity to oarry on public
worship in conformity to the oommon
law. Church property is to be hand
ed over immediately to the civil au
thorities on condition that it be re
served for worship, and the positions
of cardinals and bishops as foreign
officials will be dealt with later if
the government finds it neoessary to
do so.
Hostile demonstrations against
government officials occurred at Nan
tes, Arras an Angers.
____________ = The populace '
of the last named city attacked the
pol'ce and a number of persons were
hurt. The bishop of Angers exhort
ed the people to be calm, from a win
dow of his residence, and when his
words had the desired effect, he in
vited the crowd of 5000 to accom
pany him to the oathedral, where he
pronounced the benediction.
SI MPATHIZE WITH POPE.
Rome, Deo. 14.—Enormous num
bore of messages expressing sympathy
are arriving at the Vatican and the
Vatican officials are beginning to
turn them over to the Osservatore
Romano for publication. This paper
publishes two such messages. One is
from Archbishop Ireland to Pa pel
Secertary of State Merry del Val,
begging him and the pope to accept
the deepest sympathy and expressing

MRS. HOWARD GOULD.
For several years Mrs. Howard Gould hat been much In the public eye.
Before her marriage to the sou of the late Jay Gould she was Miaa Kathrtna
Clemmons, an actress. The wide publicity to which her name has been sub
jected Is partly due to her position as the wife of a multimillionaire. Mrs.
Goukl's motto is. "Millions for defense, but not a cent for tribute or compro
mise," her claim being that trades people have tried to taka advantage of tha
fact that her husband Is rich.
BY CARDINAL GIBBONS
Baltimore, Dec. 14.—"The Amer- j
lean public does not understand the 1
present crimes in France," said Car
dinal Gibbons, when asked this even
ing for bis opinion on the French sit
uation. He continued:
"If I believe that my countrymen
would knowingly set a great organi
zation unjustly deprived of its prop
erty, tens of thousands of honest
men and noble women robbed of their
just incomes, hundreds of thousands
of people brutally wounded In wbat
they hold dearest and most sacred, a
majority in toe chamber disregard
and trample upon the rights of the
minority and the rights of millions
of their countrymen—in the name of
liberty—would knowingly see tens of
thousands of prieta and nuns tamed
oat of tbelr homes for no crime hut
that tf loving God; I say, If my
oountrymen can see and recognize all
this injustice and refuse genuine
sympathy to thoae who suffer, then 1
will leave life without faith in Amer
ican love of justice, liberty aud hu
manity.
"But the American people have not
had tbeee things put fairly before
them. In France the Jacobin party
is not dead. They bate God, they
bate Christ, they hate religion as
much as ever their fathers bated
them. But they have learned more
prudaent and measured method of at
tack. And yet the utterances of
such men are received as unsuspect
ingly by many Americans as would
be a discloeure by Mr. Cleveland or
Mr. Roosevelt or Mr. Taft..
WILL EMPLOY FORCE
To Put
Japs in the

Public
Pacific coast people, and particu
larly the citizens of Han Francisco,
are about the wrathiest section of the
whole American population just now
becau # of the president's reference
to the Japanese question in his me*
sage. Not ouly do they criticize his
I ri « ht to interfere, but they charge
h,m d,r * ctly with misstating fact#
and distorting inferences. That the

wln on ^ COI , ye t ii says editor
j 8 jj y .
The president "ays 'to shut out
Jap nese from public schools Is a
wicked absurdiiy.' They are not
shut out from th" public schools.
That is an uu'. rut.. Vie president
demands more power ' o oil fore the
rights of aliens under tiouti**. ' The
context shows that hie assumption is
that the Japanca.- have n tro-ity light
to enter our schools. There is no
basis of fact for that assumption.
"He recommends that the Japanese
be by special law admitted to natur
alization. That Is a proposition to
be ridiculed. Its natural effeot must
be to cause a Japanese exclusion set
to be press e d.
"He says that in the matter of the
exclusion of Japanese pupils: 'All
of the foroea. military end civil, of
the United States, wbioh I may law
fully employ, will be so employed.'
This is an implied threat to use mil
ltarv forces to put Japanese children
into our aohools when be well knows
be has no author'ty to do anything of
the kind, and that any such attempt
could only lead to his own Impeaoh
ment.
"That expression and the whole
tone of the paragraph will atrlke the
oountry as an exhibition of important
rage, which it is mortifying to see in
a formal message of the president."
Recalling the wild transports of en
thusiam with which the Californians
have supported the president, the
Chronicle's language is radioal iu the
extreme, not to say shocking; and
the queer thing about it Is that the
Chronicle represents only mildly the
emotions of all Californians exoept
ing possibly the federal office holders.

DUBOIS FLAYS
THEM0RM0NS
Delivers Able Speech Against
Apostle Smoot
Washington, Dec. 14—President j
Roosevelt was charged in the -euate j
yesterday with using his influence
for the election of republican Mor
mou candidates in the receut election
in Idaho aud Utah.
The charge was made by Senator
Dubois in the course of a speech ia
which he discussed the right of Reed
Smoot to a sent in the senate.
Mr. Dubois asserted the control of
the Mormon church to be completed
in hierarchy, consisting of the prest
denoy and 12 apostles, of which Mr.
Smoot was one. This control, he
maintaiuied, wns ecclesiastical, pollt
ieal aud commercial, and was exer
cised completely over follower# who
come principally from foreign ooun
tries. The constant tendency, he
said, was to make the church aud
state one, with the cou rol in the
church.
POLYGAMY PRACTICED
Polygamous relations were being
Mistalued, Mr. Dubois said, by Preai
dent Joseph Smith aud a majority of
tiie 12 apostles. Continually there
was contracting of new polygamous
marriages surreptitiously arranged
by the church in Canada, Mexloo, or
on the high aeaa.
Polygamists, bs said, occupy the
highest positions politically and in
the church, and constitute the wealth
and most powerful members of
church organization. This is a
change, he asserted, from the old
days when polygamy was entered into
indiscriminately. Now the polyga
mists are selected by officers in the
church and In this way Is built up 1
culture and aristocracy of polyga
mists. But no record of polygamous j
marriages is kept which is available |
for the American people. Became
of this, he pointed out the futility of
passing a national law piohtblthig
the practice.
MORMONK RULE.
Politically, he said, the Mormon
church holds absolute sway iu Utah
and is extending its ooutrnl into
Wyoming, Idaho and Oregon. When
Brigham H. Roberta was expe'led

About two years ago Frank Buckle
brought suit against McConaghy for

affection of his wife. Buckle eecur

came to trial and Buckle waa
allowed a judgment of 98,000,
McConahhy was allowed a new
trial, from which* Buckle's attorney
appealed to tbe supreme court of tbe
atate, which reversed Morgan's order. '
Tbe case wav again tried in the die
trict court, which again gave
Buckle a judgment for 18,000. and
It was appealed to the supreme court
thu second time. Tbe supreme court
of the slate has again decided that
the cose tie tried in the district

confoased polygamist, Mr. lluboia
j law and ordt
| the dennt'.i'
id, he was at once elevated to a
high iiosilion in the church.
As to Senator Smoot, he aaid, it
made uo difference whether be wan
or was not a polygamist. The sena
tor was a pillar in the church and la
control of its temporal, spiritual and
political polioie., aud was selected
because of Ida position in tha
church.
Hmoot," he said, "represents the
church aud uot the state, and would
do the bidding of t'ae church before
he would serve tin real 1 11 terests of
the state aud nation. By being an
sjMistle of the church, Mmoot ia one
of the chief conapiratora, and hy hia
acquiescence supports the plaua and
alius of the conspiracy."
The breaking down of the influ
ence of the church iu politics, Mr,
Dubois asserted, would do mors than
anything else to put a stop to poly
gamy.
WHEN TAFT CAME TO IDAHO.
Turning his attention to tbs cam
paign proceeding tbs recant election,
Mr. Dubola read the press dispscUi ot
October 22, which stated that th*
president had sent Beoretary raft la
Idaho in order to speak In advocacy
of law am 1 - tdar. At that, time Mr.
Dubois said, he had telegraphed to
the president that the only Issue in
Idaho was tin naira of the Mormon
hiernehy to 00 • nue to dominate the
politics nf th" state, and that the
president bao been misled if he
thought there was any other issue.
