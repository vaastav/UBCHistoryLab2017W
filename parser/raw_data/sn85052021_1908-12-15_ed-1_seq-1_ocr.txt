How the St Asaph Got Its Name
MR EDITOR Since 1 first became a
resident of Stanford I have had some
curiosity to know what Influenced Gen
Logan to name his fort at this place St
Asaph which name has been given to
the stream flowing through the town I
and which name Is painted in glaring
letters over the entrance to one of our
local hotels and I have only gained the
information within the last few days
It may be a matter of interest to oth
er and I give you the facts as I have
learned them
St Asaph was ono of the 065 monks
of the monastary founded by St Kentl
Kern Bishop of Glasgow Scotland on
the river Elwy In North Wales He
lived about the year 600 ho was illus
trlous for his birth virtues and alleged
jnlraclea he became Abbot and Bishop
of Liar Elwy and the Catholic church
has sot apart the first day of May as
feast day in hla honor
Gen Benjamin Logan a son of Irish
parents In 1776 determined to come to
Kentucky and accompanied by only
two or three slaves traveled through
the wilderness and on May 1 1776
pitched his camp at the Spring one
mile West of the present town where
ho afterwards built his fort which was
called St Asaph
Mr John F B Lillard who has always
ways taken an Interest In historic mat
tore got from his father James M
Llllard who settled In or near liar
rodidurg in 1825 the statement that
upon the planting of the settlement the
question immediately arose as to
what name should be applied to the
spring and the fort and a Welshman In
the party suggested that It be giver
the name St Asaph because Logans
first encampment there had been upon
the day of the feast of St Asaph
Our townsman Mr John Bright who
was born In Lincoln county In 1833 was
told by Rev S S McUobcrts of the
Presbyterian church who was born In
1807 that hla father John McRobcrU
a contemporary of Benjamin Logan
had It from the mouth of Gen Logan
himself that following the buffalo trail
on his way from Virginia he reached
the spring and first camped there on
May 1 1776 and named the settlement
St Asaph In honor of that fact
The first court held in Kentucky was
for Lincoln county and was organized
at Harrodiburg Jan 16 1781 and the
following order was entered
Benjamin Logan having offered 10
acres of ground including the Buffalo
Spring for building a court house and
other necessary public buildings and 60
acres one mile cast from said spring as
long as the court shall continue there
and as it appears to the court to be the
most convenient place it is ordered
that the court bo held there for the fu
ture Ordered that the court bo ad
journed from Harrodsburg to St
Asaphs to be held there the next court
in course
S On May 1C 1786 the court of Quar
ter Sessions held for Lincoln county or
dered that the court homo and prison
bo removed to the town of Standfordon
the lands convoyed by Benjamin Logan
gent to the court
This Is the first mention made of the
I town by its present name though due
to early magisterial orthography mis
spelled Whence the name Stanford 7 In Lin
coln county England is the municipal
and parliamentary borough of Stanford
Its name in early form was Staenford
but In Domesday Book a record con
taining nil the surveys in England and
made between 1031 and 1086 it Is called
Stanford and styled a Kings borough
In tho reign of Stephen the king had
a meeting at Stanford in 1140 with tho
Earl of Chester to conclude a peace
In 1215 tho barons assembled thero to
oppose the king In tho reign of lien
ry III the carl of Cornwall assem
bled the discontented barons there and
required thoktng to restore the Magna
Ciarta and the Charta do Forcsta One
kof thojcrosses which marked the rest
Ing place of Queen Eleanors body was I
erected at Stanford Several parlia
ments and councils were held there In
the middle ages It was a seat of learn
ing and when dissensions arose among
the students of Oxford and Cambridge
in the reign of Edward III they moved
to Stanford
The historic battle of Lose coatfiehj
was fought here In the civil war of
tho Roses Sir Roberts Wells out of re
venge forhls fathers death whom Ed
ward IV had beheaded raised n rebel
lion gatherad an army of 30000 Lin
coln county men and was defeated with
dreadful loss at Stanford The van
quished casting oft their coats to run
the faster gave the battle its name
This Kentucky county was named
Lincoln in honor of Gen Benjamin Lin
coin who was deputed by Washington
to receive tho sword of Lord Cornwallls
at his surrender It was natural that
our pioneer fathers should have named
the county seat Stanford in honor of
the historic municipality in the county
of the same name In England
