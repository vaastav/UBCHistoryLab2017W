PROPRIETORS.

The STAR this week gives its readers
the full test of the President's message.
It may be out of place and the reqeust
may seem to convey a covert insinua
tion, yet we ask a careful reading of
the message. It contains a vast
amount of information, and will con
vince a candid.raan whether republican
or democrat that President Harrison is
a man "of the people and for the pe
pie."
The STAR farors the federation
of the various labor unions and farm
ers of the country. It is becoming more
and more apparent that without some
union and harmony of action the labor
ing classes would be left out entirely
in the legislative shuffle. Corporations
and corporate money and power has
far too long had too great an influence
upon all legislative bodies from the
national congrcss to the state legisla
tures. Corporate bodies are known to
be selfish bodies and while it perhaps
may not be charged as a primary prin
ciple upon which action is based that
corporate influence has been thrown
against the masses yet as a primary
principle it can be alleged that corpor
ate influence has been all for corpor
ate benefit whether the interests of the
masses were snbserved or not. This
federation means the crcation of an in
stitution that will have weight with
legislators and congressmen. It means
that the great body of laborers of the
country are uniting not only for
temporal good but for united political
action and it means an aggregation of
voting strength that the office holder
and office seeker dare not snub.
For General Good.
A meeting of representatives from
the Farmers' Alliance of the United
States and the various labor unions
was held at St. Louis last week. This
meeting was lisld for the purpose of
considering a union of all the labor or
ganizations of the country. The re
sult of this meeting is a federation of
all the farmers' and laborers' unions
with the Knights of Labor, and will be
aunionofthe northern and southern
bodies of the farmers. The following
are the officers: President, L. L. Polk,
of North Carolina Vice Pres., D. H.
Clover, of Kansas Secretary, J. H.
Turner, of Georgia Treasurer, YVm.
Kickman, of Missouri National Lec
turer, Benjamin Terrill, of Texas.
It was agreed that the farmers
should appoint a legislative committee
of two to act in conjunction with the
legislative committee of the Knights'
at Washington, to secure legislation in
accordance with the views of both
bodies. A committee on platform was
agreed upon and also a committee on
land, money, transportation and re
form, and an understanding arrived at
by which each organization will act
ively assist the other in every
way
pos­
sible. The executive officers of the two
organizations will form a central
council to consult from time to time
upon all matters of joint interest.
The various farmers' bodies have
agreed upon a plan of consolidation
which will, as soon as the necessary
reference can be had to the various
state organizations, result in bringing
about an absolute union in one body.
It is probable that in time the knights
will also join the farmers in actual
union. In the meantime the leaders of
both bodies are entirely satisfied with
the practical federaticn now consum
mated.
The National Farmers' Alliance has
adopted a long series of resolutions
favoring woman suffrage, the reserva
tion of public lands for actual settlers
and against the acquisition of lands by
aliens, for the rigid enforcement of the
law against railroad corporations that
were not complying with their con
tracts as to the disposition of lands
calling for free coinage of gold and
silver, and an amendment to the law
which permitted loans to banks on
bonded security of money at 1 per
cent., while forttieife were obliged to
pay 8 and 10 per ceiit. favoring the
payment of the public debt'as rapidly
as possible opposing bonds as a basis
for' loans, and reiterating the argu
ment against the national banking sys'
tern, and in favor of the greenback doc
trine for takes "on real estate and mort
gages and a graded income tax. Econ

ment employes. The liquor traffic was
Appdsed mall its forms. The Henne
pin canal projwt was indorsed, as was
also that of a harbor on the gulf coast.
Another resolution was passed recom
mending congress to take some action
to compel the Union Pacific and Cen
tral Pacific railroads to pay their
debts, and objecting to any further ex
tension o( time. The Australian sys
tem of voting was enthusiastically en
dorsed, and a resolution on the tariff
favored such revision and reduction
that taxes might rest as lightly as pos
sible upon productive labor, and that
its burdens might be imposed upon the
luxuries and removed fiom the neces
saries of life.
County Court.
Tlio bar of Deadwood has prepared a
bill controlling the county courts, of
which the following, from the Dead
wood Times, is a synopsis:
The bar has prepared a bill for pre
sentation to the legislature, on the first
day of the approaching session, defin
ing the duties of the court, fixing fees,
and Otherwise placing the machinery
in gear. An effort, we understand,
will be made, to enlarge the jurisdic
tion of the court, by classifying as mis
demeanors,' criminal offenses, punish
ment for which sliall be imprisonment
for three years or less, prosecution to
be on information.
The proposed classification of coun
ties makes counties of 15.000 and up
ward population, first-class 10,000
second class and 5,000 third class. Sal
aries of judges of the first class to be
$2,000. Rules of practice to be the
same as the circuit court, and appeals
to lie to the supreme court only the
county court to have exclusive and
final jurisdiction in appeals from jus
tice's court. The bill also provides
that cases pending in the circuit court,
of which the county court might have
had jurisdiction, may be transferred to
the county calendar for. trial on motion
of cither party. The bill provides for
six terms per annum that the court
shall always lie open for the transac
tion of business, juries to be drawn in
the usual manner, but only when in
the opinion of the judge the business of
the court shall justify, juries, as in the
circuit court, to consist of twelve. The
bill was drawn by a committee and has
not yet been submitted. It, however,
meets the approval of all to whom it
has been shown.
It is also suggested that authority be
given the circuit judge to call in the
couuty judge, ana vice versa, for the
hearing or trial of cases like the pres
ent clerkship entanglement, determi
nation of which the regular presiding
judge may not desire to undertake.
The Australian Ballot.
Dubuque Herald.
Under the Australian system, nomi
nations of candidates are made the
same as now. A designated public
officer receives the nominations of the
different parties, or any made by the
written indorsement of a numlier of
citizens, and on a certain day before
the election, posts and advertises the
names of all candidates. If a candi
date dies or withdraws, another can be
substitued. The state, county or city
government prepares and prints the
ballots. They are not furnished, as
now, by political parties or candidates,
but by the proper authorities, the bal
lots being all alike. On each ballot the
names of all the candidates are printed,
arranged alphabetically under the
heading of the office for'which they are
running. In Montana,- where this sys
tem is used, and the other places, the
name of the political party which nom
inated thfe candidates is printed after
the name.
When a voter enters a room where
the balloting is being done,one of these
ballots is handed him by a judge or
clerk of election. He goes into one of
the several little booths in the room,
separated from each other by wooden
or canvass partitions, and marks across
after the name of each candidate for
Whom he wishes to vote. He then
proceeds to the ballot box, which is in
side a guard rail and at least six feet
from the booths. The rest of the bal
loting is done in the usual way, his
right to vote being established by regis
tration or whatever way is required
The ba'.iot must be folded, and must
not be marked in any way to distin
guish or identify it, under penalty for
criminal offense. No ballet can be
taken from the room under
If the one received is spoiled it can
returned to the clerk and another ob
tained. Specimen ballots are posted
up outside the voting place so that the
voters can familiarize themselves with
it. If a man is illiterate or is blind his
ballot can be marked for him by the
clerk, such ballot being so endorsed.
If the votintr this fall in Iowa were
to be done under the Australian sys
tem, the ballot wduld begin in this
style:
FOR GOVERNOR.
HORACE BOIES, Democrat.
ELIA8 DOTY, Prohibition.
8. B. DOWNING, Union Labor.
O. HUTCHISON, ltspnbUean.
An so on down the ballot for each
state, county and township office, the
names of each candidate being placed
alphabetically under the heading of the
office for which he was nominated.
The voter places a cross in a little
square plaee after the name of the can
didate he wants to vote for, as above.
