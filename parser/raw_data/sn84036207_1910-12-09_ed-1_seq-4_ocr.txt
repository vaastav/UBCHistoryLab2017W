Judge Myers has "raised" the "ante, "

tent. as to preclude any but the most
foolhardy among the boys from par
ticipating in jack-pots.
Picking cherries in December, an
incident that occurred yesterday in an
orchard near Hamilton, is a spectacle
that causes the most blase among the
globe trotters to set up and take no

The public can believe the assur
ance of Montana liquor dealers that
they will not seek any legislation at
the approaching session of the law
makers, and in addition can be reason
ably certain that the saloon interests
will use extraordinary endeavors to
avoid getting any legislation on the
subject, observes the Montana Look

President Taft's message is chiefly

traying a natural inclination for
stand-pattism and conservatism of the

responsible for the democratic victory. 1
The dispatch explains: "'The demo- 1
cratic party can thank the women of
the United States for the fact that they
will control the next congress. Their
strenuous protests against the high
cost of living wrecked the high tariff
party.' was a sentiment emitted by
Emerson Hough, novelist, here today i
at a banquet of the Hawkeye Fellow-I
ship (dub which made every Iowan j
.present sit up and take notice. 'High
prices bore upon the women,' Hough •
declared. 'They control the votes just 1
as they control all affairs of life. Man
himself is almost entirely what women i
make him. He is a creature largely of}
prenatal influence. The creative
forces of the mothers mould the minds,!
the character and the physique of the |
man. In their hands is the future of
the race.' "

"THE CHINATOWN
TRUNK MYSTERY"
Opening Tuesday, December 13, in
the Lucas opera house comes "The
Chinatown Trunk Mystery." Some one
has said " the only good Indian is a
dead one." The same might be applied
to the Chinaman as America gets him.
The power of the Tongs is remark
able, to a degree and in New York,
San Francisco and other large cities
where a Chinatown of any large size
exists, once an enemy to them is made,
he or her name becomes marked with
a cross of death. The homicide of
Elsie Sigel was only one of the many
hideous crimes committed and never
solved. The danger to white women
mingling with the Chinese in their
endeavor to convert them to our belief
is seldom realized outside the police
departments who must deal with a
Chinatown. The women themselves
seem blind to their danger and disre
gard the advice and pleadings of
friends and relatives, continuing on to
almost certain disaster.
The many merry parties who derive
so much pleasure from their slumming
trips into Chinatown little realize of
the haunts they "nearly see" close by
where their human sisters are sinking
to oblivion and death and they them
selves are being devoured by the hun
gry eyes of America's lowest class of
criminal. Yet these are facts and it is
the desire of "The Chinatown Trunk
Mystery" to convince our public intel
ligently of the pitfalls which confront
our women who consider it their duty
to enter Chinatown and teach a people
who are loath to give up their tradi
tions. The play deals with the tragedy
that repulsed the entire country, and
does not handle it with kid gloves, but
depends upon the facts as the police
found them. It is a wonderfully in
structive play to those who know not
the situation. A pretty little love
story and heart interest has been in
terwoven around a young friend of
Elsie Sigel, Marion Grey and a New
York detective. Comedy is not lack
ing in the four acts and scenically the
play is said to be a revelation of the
scene painter's art.
