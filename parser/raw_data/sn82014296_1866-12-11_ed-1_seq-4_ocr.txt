i Through , the , politeness ,,of , jsome

been fayored with - the details of one
of those " little episodes " with which
the unterrified " are wont to vary

'The official returns' of German
Township at the late election
gave
Judge DeBkuler 88 votes.
The Union men of that'' township,
and the county generally; were aston
ished at a result so much at ' variance
with the facts demonstrated by a care
ful canvass a few days, before the elec
tion, and supported hy a variety of
collateral "circumstances. They be
lieved that an outrage had been per
petrated; that one' or more members
of the Election Board, following the
.well -remembered example of " Joel,"
(tetania 8co Precinct, had '.had a con
fideatial interview-with the i ballot
box of sufficient duration to ', produce
a tm9nstrQus;birth."" ;;;:L-

Mr. Bcmp is . a gentleman of ad
vanced age, and of the best intentions,

to bd outwitted and overreached by
the canlna cunnipg of the sagacious

There is reason, to believe that
when this lupine Inspector, weaned
with patriotic toil, betook himself atj
noonday to the house of a neighbor to
procure refreshment for the outer
man, the ballot box. carefully locked,
went, with him, while the key reposed,
in the breeches pocket! of the too icon-1
fiding Mr. Bump. ' 'Al, 'v
. Of course that, honest Inspector,
that revered father of the township,
would 1 hot ' violate'- the 1 sancity of a
locked ballot box. . Tha tempting
proximity of a" duplicate key would
never induce so good a. Democrat to
swerve a hair's breadth from the path
of rectitude. ' Yet it' is' certain i that
by(some magic art, more than. thkty:
five honest Union votes were ab
stracted from that box; ' I-'tit '

'Oq the ; second day of', the 1 present
oession or Congress, Mr. Vy entworth,
ot; illlinoisV.introduced, in the Ilouse.,
a resolutioii to this effect, that u tej
sponse to the President's Message on
the status or the lately insurgent
States still excluded from Congress
"The House finds in their many acta
of disloyalty since its -last, adjourn
ment, as well as in the . recent elec
tions.in the loyal States, additional
reasons for insisting on the ; adoption
of the pending Constitutional Amend
ment Detore it will consider the. pro
priety of giving such States Congres
sional representation.";
Mr. Ancona, of Pennsylvania,' mov
ed1 to lay the resolution on the table,
which motion was negatived by a vote
bf32 to 119, and the resolution was
adopted without a division.;,'. '' !
. It. would appear from this that
about four'-fifths of the1 ruembers of
the LTouse-confirmedan the ir original
opinions by themost. emphatic, in
dorsement of the Uyal people, as well
as by nuiaberles3,act3 .ofJdisloyalty on
the part of .the Btillnnrepentant rebels
are m favor of adhering to the
amendment as a condition precedent
to the" restoration of . the excluded
States t9 a participation in-National
Legislation ''J - ' 1
Nor can the South hope for more
acceptable- term9 i rom the Fortieth
Congress, as its political complexion
will be quit as "radical", as, this.
Unless, then, the" " unrepresented
Stateswill comply with the reasonable
and generous ferms'diclated by '"the
unparalleled magnanimity of a victo
rious . party, veinay. : consider their
status as fixed till 1869, which in
volves their voluntary exclusion from
the next Presidential election.
C In, common with he .entire- Repub-:
licanTpatty w,e desire" thespeed con-"
summation of 'the work of reeon
struction,'and aTe anxious to see every
Southern State" represented by loyal
men in congress -anu - resierea1 io--its-
frfeited rights under the Constitution,
et we believe CoBgress would be re
creant to its clearly indicated duties,
and deserve tbe execrations jpf -all
;Union men. Nortli and Soutii, should
it hesitate to demand a literal compli
ance with the term's prescribed. I
l n xub uiiii luoio is uy icasuu to iear
each recreancy on, ' the part ( of the
people's ' representatives," the vote .on
Wentworth'8 ' ; tesolutioo ' clearly
proves.1 r -",".';"' ''
' There is, however, reason to appre
hend that the hostility and obstinacy
of the ruling class in the South may
convince . Congress . that mild treat
ment is not calculated to effect their
cure, and enable'the extreme Radicals,
heretofore in hopeless minority in
both the House and Senate, to carry
out their plan' of reconstruction on
the basis, of territorial governments
for the excluded States. : ;
- The adoption of the amendment,
which they seem disposed to treat with
undisguised j scorn, and contempt, is
their only hope, and we are unwilling
to believe they will continue to reject
it till the day of grace is past, and
harder terms are demanded
'1 Their final submission is but a
question of time, and if they have
any regard for their own t interests, if
they are 'capable of discerning "the
signs of the times," they will hasten
to take the necessary steps to secure
the benefit of the terms now offered.

AGE5TTS HASTED FOR THE Pic
torial Book o T f
Anecdotes axX Incidents
,1,1,0 THE REBELLION. , ;f(
There is a certain portion of the war that
will never go into the regular histories,
nor be embodied in romance or poetry,
which is a yery real part ,of it, and will, if
preserved,' convey to succeeding go tie ra
tions a better idea of the spirit of the con
flict, t han minv drv renorts or careful nar
ratives of events; and this part may be
called the gossip, the fun, the pathos of the
war. This illustmteK the characters of the
leaders, the humor of the soldiers, the de-
' votlon of women, the bravery of men, the,
pluck of our heroes, the romance ana tiara .
ships of the service. -.
The volume is proiuseiy niusiraiea witn
over 300 engravings dv tne nrsi artists,
which are really beautiful; worthy of exam
ination as specimens of the art. Many of
them are set into tbe body of the text, after
the potmlar style of .Losslng's Pictorial
Field-Book of the Revolution. The
book's contents In el ad a remlnlfCencV's f
camp, picket, scout, 'spy", bivouac, si6ge,
and battle-field adventures; thrilling feats
of bravery, wit, drollery, comical and ludi
crous adventures, etc.. etc, , . ..
Amusement as wen as iu-ruciioa may
be found in every page, as graphic detail,
brilliant wit, and .authentic history are
skillfully interwoven in this work of liter
ary art. . .. V.,.. t v ! ...
The DeoDle are tire"Of fin- detail ana
partisan works, and want something hu
morous, romantic, and startling. Our.,
agents are making from SluO to 200 per ..
