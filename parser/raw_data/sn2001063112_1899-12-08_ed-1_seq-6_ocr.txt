THE MITCHELL CAPITAL
FRIDAY, DECEMBERS, 1899.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
While tlu president's message may
be longer than such documents usually
arc, yet President McKinley has had
more to deal with than is usually the
ease. The message has been looked
forward to with unusual interest and
its words are not in the least dis
appointing in what it was expected
the chief magistrate would say npon
certain topics. There is a firmness and
strength in his words that gives con
fidence to the people the executive
with a confidence of his being able to
carry out the things which he be
lieves to be the best for this nation.
Probably the most, interisting port
ion of the message and one that will
be read with greater interest is that
concerning the Philippines. He care
fully points out the successive steps
that has placed the absolute sovereignty
of the islands in the hands of this
government. lie relates the earnest
efforts that were put forth by the
administration and the naval and
military representatives of this nation
to avoid anything of a conilict with the
natives. The president does not offer
his own knowledge of the situation as
to withdrawing from the islands hut
submits the evidence furnished by the
non-partisan commission which visited
the islands to make the investigation
011 this point. Concerning the future
government of the Philippines the
president does not assume to look into
the future to advise the kind of a
government that will be satisfactory to
the people of the island, but wisely
leaves it to congress and the develop
ment of the future, and points out the
impracticability of giving the natives
independence under a protectorate.
The other acquisitions of territory
were thoroughly discussed.
Concerning the matter of financial
legislation the president is not mis
understood when he says it "is the most
fitting time to make adequate provis
ion to insure the continuance of the
gold standard and of the public con
fidence in the ability the purposes of
the government to meet all its obli
gations in the money which the civi
lized world recognizes as the best."
and urges the adoption of the gold
basis.
The president does not mince his
words when it conies to the matter of
trusts. He declares that trusts are
organized "Lo crush out all healthy
competition and to monopolize the pro
duction or sale of ail article of com
merce and general necessity." and
which are "dangerous conspiracies
against the public good that should be
mad'' the subject of prohibitory and
even penal legislation." The presi
dent- expresses the hope that a more
uniform system of state legislation may
be enacted so as to compete with the
trusts and that "means may be found
by congress, within the limits of its
constitutional power, so to supplement
an effective code of state legislation as
to make a complete system of laws
throughout the United States adequate
to compel a general observance of the
salutary rules to which reference is
made."
Many other important topics are en
larged upon that are worthy cUreful
reading and consideration by the peo
ple. The message as a whole gives a
faithful account of the president's
stewardship in every department of the
government- and of the progress of the
industries of the countrv.
When Senator I'ettigrew made the
statement that he was ashamed of his
country of course it was published in a
good many papers and it finally reached
the eyes of Hob Burdette. After Bob
had made a long comment on the
senator's remarks he wound up by
making this pat illustration 011 the
South Dakota senator: "I once saw a
Kentucky mare, beautiful as a dream,
victor in a hundred races, suckling a
mule colt. And I have 110 doubt some
times that mule went hee-hawing
around the pasture, bawling that he
was ashamed of his mother.''
Now that the football season is over
with the. students all over the country
ran settle down to their studies until
alie spring athletics begin. Football
has a higher standing among the col
leges now that it ever had before, as
many of the unpleasant features have
been eliminated, and further because
She game is played principally by the
college teams. As the game is now
played it will always be popular and
will remain in a favorite with the
public.
Congress convened Monday noon and
after it had been called to order Gen.
Henderson, of Iowa, was elected speak
er. The opening was attended by no
scene of excitement other than Roberts'
episode when he came forward to take
the oath of congressman. Charges
were preferred against him as a poly
gamist and bigamist questioning his
eligibility to a seat in that body. Mr.
Roberts was asked to defer being
sworn in until the charges were in
vestigated. A committee of nine was
asked to be appointed to whom should
be referred the question as to whether
he should be sworn in, and for the
1
house to decide upon such question and
right. In the senate charges were
also preferred against Senator Quay
from Pennsylvania and Senator Clark
from Montana against their taking
their seats. The two senators were
sworn in, however, but the investigat
ion will be taken up some time later.
The senate adjourned at noon in honor
of the memory of Vice President
Ilobart.
It is going to take some money to
run the country until .Tune 30, 190],
according to the estimates of the secre
tary of the treasury. The aggregate
appropriations for the two years
amount to $1,li.'H.0*1.994.
Billy Mason and Hilly Atkinson have
been insulted and slighted by their
chief. A few days ago Aguinaldo is
sued a proclamation and made a special
mention of his friend, W. .T. Bryan,
without ever taking into consideration
the other two gentlemen. It is an
affront the friends of these two "aunt
ies" should not overlook. They have
been too zealous in the cause to not be
recognized by the Filipino adminis
tration.
The reform press association held a
meeting at Huron a few days ago and
one of the things they did was to en
dorse the candidacy of Railroad Com
missioner LaFolletle for the nomi
nation of governor and to agree to give
Tommy Avers anything that he might
ask for. This is what the reform
editors want to do. The populists may
object to their way of doing. La
Follette would be an easy mark for
governor.
Hon. James McDowell, who was
register of the Huron land office during
the Harrison administration, died in
Washington Saturday and was buried
at Bloomington, 111., on Monday. The
deceased gentleman has many friends
in this state who will regret to hear of
his death. He came to this state long
before it was admitted and lived among
us until he removed to Washington to
accept a position under the govern
ment.
Maris Taylor, who has been Govern
or Lee's public examiner ever since he
was elected governor, has tendered his
resignation and accepted the receiver
ship of a building and loan association
in Aberdeen. Mr. Taylor evidently
hasn't much faith in the fusion party
winning in the next campaign and lets
go of a job that hasn't a very long life
to it for one that will last a number of
years. A number of changes have
been rung in on Andy since he became
governor of South Dakota.

It is *ften difficult t* decide what to
gat your friends f»r holiday gifts.
Here's a suggestion:
"Good morning, Jeania, I hava
brought you a nice present," said Gar
trude, as she handed her friend a neatly
wrapped package.
Tha pale, weary looking girl, who
was slowly recovering from severe ill
ness, opened the bundle and held up a
large bottle of clear rich medicine,
"Hood's Sarsaparilla!" she exclaim
ed. "I have been reading about it to
day and wished I had a bottle."
On New Year's Day Jennie was able
to be out on the street, and to her
friends who remarked how well she
was looking she simply said, "Hood's
Sarsaparilla," and every one of them
knew it was this great medicine that
had given back her health.
Notice
is hereby given that tho Board of
County Commissioners will meet in

GAME WENT ALL ONE WAY.
Grand Forks Took the Football Game
and Left Mitchell Nothing for
a Remembrance.
ere is a dense quietness in foot
ball circles since the game of football
played between the teams of Dakota
University of this city and the Univer
sity eleven of Grand Forks, North Da
kota. The came was played at Sioux
Falls on Thanksgiving day and early in
the morning our eleven, Accompanied
by abvjt 40 «nthu'ia*tic rooters, board,
ed he Omaha train for the point of
war. Expectations were very high as
to winning the game when the boys
started from home but after a short
time, when play began, there was a de
cidedly different feeling which per
vaded the breasts of our boys. We
have heard a dozen accounts oT the
game from as many people who saw
it, and the whole thing summed up was
the one fact thai the Grand Forks boys
were entirely too swift for the home
team They would go through cur
line with ease and when they didn't
oare to go through it they would go
over it and make the desired gain. It
wat phenomenal in the swiftness with
which those fellows from the north
state played the game. Tnev would
simply carry our boys off their feet by
their rushss. Notwithstanding this
the Mitchell boys put up a remarkably
strong game for a losing team, and
they played witri a great deal of nerve
throughout the entire game, going
after their opponents with the same
vigor that thev displayed at the open
ing of the contest.
It bas heen impossible to get a de
tailed report of the gama—as the de
tails were taken to Grand Forks. It i*
consoling, however, to know that the
captain of the Grand Forks team com
plimented our boys very highly on the
manner in which they put their de
fense. There has one thing resulted
from the contact with the North Da
kota boys—the University eleven has
learned some points about football
which they hitherto have not possessed
and in the future they will be able to
put up a muob stronger game. The
Mitchell boys are capable of playing
winning football—there is no discount
ing that fact—but they realize now that
they will have to play a swifter game
than they have been doing and as Prof.
Blodgett has been trying to impress
upon them. The professor takes the
defeat philosophically and in th»
future he will receive closer attention
to his instructions from the eleven.
The score was 41 to 0.
Late in the afternon news from Sioux
Falls was anxiously awaited by a crowd
down town and when the result of the
first half was received by telegraph the
evidence was plain that our boys were
outclassed. The arrival of the train
that night was awaited to find out from
the boys just how it was done, and they
all atfmitted it was just the swiftness of
their opponents. The defeat in nowise
dimishes the enthusiasm of the support
ers of the home team and they will
retrieve that defeat the first oppor
tunity that is given them.
The Vermillion team had a game
with the Iowa Slate Normal team at
Sioux City Thursday that ended in a
tie, neither side kcoring.
THE DECEMBER WEATHER.
L.
AL
G.
Next year the annual encampment
will be held in this city aDd the officers
were selected with reference to their
ability to handle an affair of that
magnitude. The old soldiers have
long wanted to come to Mitchell and it
is expected that a greater number will
assemble here than has attended any
previous encampment in several years
The last time the encampment met in
this city was in the year 1892, early in
the spring. This time the encamp
ment will be held in the summer
months and will be more pleasant for
the old soldiers to leave their homes on
their annual outing.
A Gift to ®ive.
Storms and Pleasant Weather Vary­
ing Through the Month is
OU'ered by Hicks.
The weather for December is going
to be a mixture of stormy and pleasant
weather, according to the prophesies of
Prof. Hioks, the first two .of which
turned out just as the prophet had in
dicated. For the rest of the month the
weather man has the following: A
regular storm period extends from the
5th to the 9th. About the 6th falling
barometer and chaDge to warmer will
will set in over western sections, and
these conditions will move eastward,
growing in magnitude and intensity,
resulting in rain and snow oyer most
parts of the country during the tkh,
7tb, 8th and 9tb.
Warmer weather, growing cloudi
ness and falling barometer will pre
cede storms colder, clearing weather
and rising barometer will foliow them.
The crisis of this period will probably
not be reached until the moon orosses
the equator on the 9th, at which time
look for winter lightning and thunder
in southern sections. A blizzard to the
northward will be due about the same
date. Much coller weather generally
will follow for several days.
On and touching the 12th and 13th
look for a reaction to much warmer
attended by falling barometer and gen
eral return to storm conditions and
storminess. Marked fall of barometer
and general return to winter storms
will be natural during the storm period
10th to 20th. Another reaction to
warmer with falling barometer and
more rain and snow, may be counted on
during the 23rd and 24th and days
touching them. Moon is in apogee on
the 22nd, on the celestial equator on
the 2.'ird and at last quarter on the 24th.
About these dates prudent readers of
these forecasts will expect a renewal of
very general and active winter storms,
as the moon goes southward over the
celestial equator the atmospheric tide
will incline that way, inducing north
erly currents and a severe cold wave.
Don't be overtaken unawares. The in
dications are that Chriatmass will be
clear or elciring, with rising barom
eter and quite cold in most sections of
the country. Solstice squalls of wind
and local snow storms will prevail here
and there, but no general storms will
be iu progress.
A regular storm period, blended
with a Mercury disturbance covers the
last four or five days of December.
About Thunday, tho 2S:h, a decided
fall of the barometer and rise of tem
perature will be noted in western ex
tremen, and these conditions will lead
rapidly into storms of wird and rain,
which 6torms will pas* eastwardly
across the country during Friday the
29th to Monday, January 1, 1900.
FOUND DEAD AT LETCHER.
Mrs. Uroderick, a Widow Lady.
Hied Suddenly and Was Not
Found for a Day.
The body of Mrs. Susan Broderick
was found in her home in Letcher
yesterday cold in death, her demise
oeiog due to heart disease. Not see
ing her around for a day the neighbors
became alarmed and went into the
house. Mrs. Brod'.-rick was found
lying on the lloor and clasped in her
band was a book. She had been read
ing and evidently fell from her chair
aB she attempted to rise. It was evi
dent that she bad been dead about
twenty-four hours. A slight br.r'se
was noticed on her face, wuich was
^ery likely made by falling and strik
ing some object. A few days ago the
deceased lady was iu the city and took,
treatment fur heart disease and she
jtated to some of her friends at the
time that she was afraid that she
would live but a short time, as her
heart had been giving her some trouble
of late. Miss Lily Broderick, a daugh
ter of the deceased lady, has been at
tending school at the University and
left this morning for her home,
•he having recived word last night of
the death of her mother. Mrs. Brod
erick was a widow lady and was living
alone. She was very highly esteemed
by the Letcher people and her death
will be regretted by the citizens of that
town.
My son had been troubled for years
with chronic diarrhoea. Sometime

Going to bed to tumble and toss and
dream to pursue in vain the phantom
sleep through long weary hours and rise
to a new day unrested and unrefreshed,
That is the way with many a woman, who
is tormented by the aches and pains re
sulting from female weakness, and other
diseases of the delicate organs of woman.
Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription was
made to cure just such cases and it does
what it was made for. It heals ulcera
tion and inflammation, dries debilitating
drains, cures female weakness, strength
ens the body, soothes the nerves and
enriches the blood. It gives lasting
strength for the day and sound sleep
for the night.
For three years I suffered continually." writes
Mrs. L-
J.
Dennis, of S28 East College St., Jack­
sonville, Ills. «I sought relief among the medical
profession and found none, until induced to try
Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription When I
commenced taking thi» medicine I weighed
ninety-five pounds. It built me up until now I
weigh one hundred and fifty-six pounds—more
than I ever weighed before. I was so bad I
would lie from day to dav and long for death to
come and relieve my sufleiing I hail internal
inflammation, a disagreeable drain, bearing
down pains and such distress every month. liiit
now I never have a pain—do all my own work
and am a strong and healthy woman. Thanks
to your medicine."
