MANITOWOC. WISCONSIN
THURSD MBER 16, 1869.
Closed. —The public Schools in our
village close to-morrow for the holidays.
Thanks. — Our thanks are due to Hon.
Pbiletus Sawyer. M. C.. for valuable
public documents.
Another Dance. —Those festively in
clined will have an opportunity to “trip
the light fantastic” at the Four Corners
on Christmas eve.
—
■Rain.— On Friday and Saturday last
<wa were del iged with a cold, drizzling
rain, whicn when frozen gave the side
walks*s cLovowisli tendency.
Hacb.^ — I The race which was to come
off last Saturday was postponed notil
next Saturday afternoon, when a lively
contest is to vorae off.o pen for all horses
whose time exceeds 2:17 1
Broke His Neck.—On Saturday last,
as a valuable horse belonging to Mr. A.
D. Jones was drawing a load of edgings
up the hill near that gentleman’s mill,
he slipped and broke his neck, killing
him almost instantly.
Personal. —W. W. Waldo, Esq.,
our County Judge elect, returned from
an extended visit to friends in the east
on Monday, looking hale and hearty as
usual.
—Our friend Tom Cole, one of the m
dispe nsibles of the Beckman House, in
Sheboygan, showed bis handsome phiz
in our sanctum this morning.
Wanted. —There are three marriage
able young ladies in Manitowoc to one
yonng man. A “healthy immigration”
of the latter would be relished by the
fair ones.
Improvement. —That wide-awake pa
per, the Appleton Pott , now prints its
own outsides, which is a decided im
provement on the ‘ ‘patent arrangement.
That shows energy, too, and a good sup
port.
Margin. —Thera will be no additional
charge lor the extra margin on our paper
this week. The irregularity of the boats,
and our inability to get our paper from
Milwaukee on time is what s the mat
ter.
The Message. —ln our Supplement
to-day will be found the President’s
Message to Congress—one of the wisest
and most judicious ever transmitted to
that body, and one that will meet the
hearty approval of all.

•■O, we flew o’er the ground with the greatest of
ewe,” Ac.
For a fast horse give us our favorite,
* ‘Buckskin, ’ ’ noticithstfimJinn.
Prospectuses.*— ln this issue will be
found many pospectuses which it would
be well for our readers to examine and
p-ilect therefrom the one which suits
best. There is nothing so cheap and
entertaining as reading, and a choice list
is offered to select from.
Died. —The death of the estimable
wife of Sam. Ryan, Jr., editor of the
Appleton Crescent , occurred in that city
•on the Ist inst, after a long and painful
illness. Bro. Ryan has the heartfelt
sympathies,of a host of friends through
out the State in his great affliction.

Railroad Meeting at Mishicott.—
The people of this lively little town held
a meeting last week on the railroad ques
tion, and showed themselves strongly in
•favor of a Lake Shore Road—promising
to take stock in th same and pay either
in cash or ties. Such a universal com
motion means business, we think, and
epeaks well for that little town.
Don’t Do It.— We hava frequently
noticed that many of the boys,—and in
acme cases “old boys”—are in the habit
of creating an unpleasant commotion in
the post office while awaiting the distri
bution of the mail. This is a great an
noyanco to our post-master and as the
practice is rudj and ungentlemanly we
hope it will be stopped.
Two Rivers. —We learn irom our
correspondent “0.” at Two Hirers that
a cooper shop was destroyed by fire in
that village on Thursday last, causing
a savers loss to the owner, us he had a
■considerable amount of provisions stowed
in it; also that the railroad excitement
has not abated any, and that all are in
favor of a railroad somewhere. We sin
■oerely hope they will have it soon.
Provoking. —There should, in our
opinion, be some measures taken to avoid
the delay caused every time it is neces
sary to open our bridge, Eor some rea
son it usually takes from fifteen minutes
to half an hour to open and close it, and
all that time a long string of teams and
a crowd of pedestrians are gathered at
both ends anxious to cross. Either put
the bridge is such a condition that it
will tarn easily or else build anew one at
Main Street,

of vessels and steamers that have gone
into winter quarters at this port, with
the tonnage of each. This includes about

On, Dont! —The Sheboygan Times
has the unblushing impudence to say
that the water in that little creek is deep
er and affords better advantages than
ours. Were it not an utter impossibility
for a craft larger than a good sized fish
ing boat to got into the river through
the promiscuously placed lot of timber hon
ored with the title of harbor , we would
be willing to acknowledge that there was
a “showing” for preference ; but just
now there isn’t. When Sheboygan river
float* the steamer Manitowoc we guaran
tee to charter the G eat Eastern to give
an excursion to the Rapids.
Again Stricken. —Last week we
made mention of the sad experiences of
Mr. Weinschenk—he having lost three
children in one week by scarlet fever—
who has again been afflicted, his oldest
son —the last one, expiring on Friday
last, a victim of the same ravaging dis
ease. Surely such an overwhelming
succession of losses seems almost too
much to bear, and we are sure that all
our citizens sympathize with the bereav
ed parents in their great sorrow. The
deceased being a member of the band,
his funeral was attended by both, as also
a large processien of sympathizing
friends.

A CARD.
Thanks ! thanks ! many thanks for the
kind response of a generous public. The
First Presbyterian Society of Manitowoc,
a few weeks since, asked for two thousand
dollars to he used in preliminary winter
work on their proposed new church. —
That sum has been fully subscribed, and
nearly ail paid. Our arrangements for
contracting the whole work have been
made. We look forward with the ex
pectation that our beautiful structure will
be complete within one year from to-day.
Besides our available resources, and
pledges made by responsible parties, we
need, during the coming year, from the
citizens of this village and county, four
thousand dollars to carry out our contract.
Lumber in all forms for building, shingles,
lime, iron, nails and materials for paint
ing, and team work during the winter,
all could be made to count with us as casln
if volunteered soon, and help along our
work. Can we not confidently appeal to
a public proved already to be so gener
ous, with an assurance that an object so
complimentary 7 to village and county taste
and pride, they will not suffer to fail,
when now within such easy roach ?
In behalf of the Ist Presbyterian
Society of Manitowoc.

A Postal Decision.—The November
issue of the United States Mail publishes
a recent decision of the Postmaster Gen
eral concerning papers having one side
published in another county. He says :
“A newspaper having a known office
of publication, notwithstanding one side
of the same is printed in another county
or State, is entitled to the same privileg
es as though both sides were printed .at
the said office of publication.

THE TOTE.
A vote w'as taken December Bth on the
two thousand dollar railroad proposition,
and the proposition was defeated by a
large majority. What does this vote
mean? It means simply business; it
means that Manitowoc understands its
railroad affairs, and knows both who are
its friends, and its enemies. The vote
does not mean that the Western road
should not be built, and built speedily,
but it means that Manitowoc cannot build
two roads at once, hence must build on%
of the two proposed roads first. One
great difficulty has been, that the village
has been divided between doing two
things, constructing a Weetern road and
a Lake Shore road. There have been
two strong parties contending against each
other, instead of joining hands, and go
ing forth as one man to the work of bring
ing a railroad into this large and already
antique village. “A house divided
against itself cannot stand.” As long as
one party is for one road, and the other
party for another, it will be all oscilation
of power and no application of power ;
the nearest approximation to business will
bs windy debate.
There have been two objects inviting
attention and hence consequental delay
as to which one to attend to. This mo
dus operand! emphatically won’t do. It
should be all of Manitowoc with one pur
pose ; for we have great obstacles to over
come, in short, too much to do to be do
ing against each other. In unity there
is strength, and in singleness of purpose,
there is promptness and energy of action.
The vote has decided that the Lake
Shore road ought to be built first. On*
reason is, that it is the smallest of the
two things to be done. It is a longer
road, but we can get more help. The
small towns on the Lake Shore can throw
in their mitj, but it is the rich railroad
companies that taka the contract* and
furnish the capital for building rail
roads. Those companies are of Mil
waukee. They can under bid any eastern
company, for one reason, among others,
that they are nearer home. Milwaukee
is going to he our great help in construct
ing the Lake Shore road, for that road
will be for its interests. But if we com
mence the building of a Western road
now, Milwaukee will look on wdth a jeal
ous eye, and cripple ■ the entei prise if
possible; while the country along the Ce
darburg and Chilton route will be no bet
ter off than before. But propose to build
the Lake Shore road, and the Chilton
route would be glad of the compromise,
and Milwaukee would rejoice atone more
iron grasp on the wealth of the North
west. The people of the Chilton route
are greatly in earnest, they are powerful
ly supported on both ends of the line,
and to swerve them from their purpose
of baying a road through their midst
at the earliest opportunity, will require
the immediate application of all the mon
ey and energy the Lake Shore towns can
command. Does any one think that the
Chilton route is going to wait two or three
years for the Western road, when the
construction of that road would greally
damage the interests of its own route ?
There would not bo any such waiting
done, and Manitowoc, at the end of that
time, would wake up from its stultified
lethargy, to find itself in the centre of
a triangl* of highways and the wheat of
its very suburbs leaving it alone to starve
to death. This matter will go before the
legislature at its coming session, and the
Chiiton route and the Lake Shore route
will bid against each other; then will be
the time when the fate of this village will
bo decided, and let every man of it, who
has a railroad dollar, or a railroad idea,
be at the auction. The president of the
western road desires the construction of
that road tirst. Why is he so obstinate
about it ? Why does bo not cheerfully
and patriotically succumb to the wishes
of a large majority of the people
of Manitowoc? The argument is against
him, and he can see that as well as any
body else. The reason of his persistent
opposition is this; that every sensible
man has always some deep underlying
motive , which is the soul and prompter of
his acts. The motive in this case is that
he has an interest in a large tract of wood
ed land, whose value the building of a
Western road would increase ten-fold,
and which be has been holding up to the
eyes of numerous railroad companies,
East and West, for some years past, and
saying “bow much will you bid.' 1 He
has looked over the heads of the masses
of the people, and been dallying with
them these many years,and procrastinating
the construction of any railroad at all,
just for the purpose of getting a higher
bid than he has yet been offered ; and
when that maximum hid is given, then
as to himself, welcome fortune and good
bye railroads.
The Western road to be sure is neces
sary, but not as necessary now as it will
be after the Lake Shore road is built.
The one road will be the iudespensable
complement to the other; either will
pay much better after the other is com
pleted; for passengers will, come here
from the West with a view ot being able
to go South, and from the South with the
view of being able to go immediately West.
And natures great harbor here would at
tract avast freight both from the far east
and the far west. Vanderbilt has got
his eye on a long natural line of transpor
tation, sweeping a vast range of country
from western Minnesota to Manitowoc,
and from thence east. The factories of
the Fox are growling, the dense forests
of the north are moaning, and the iron
knuckles of Superior are peremptorilly
rapping for admission, at the Golden
Gate ot Lake Michigan. They shall be
admitted. But if we would do what is
easiest, first, and what pays best, soonest,
and what is naturally fundamental and
antecedent to another duty, and what, if
it is not done now, can’t be done at all,
we must go one and every bod., for the
Lake Shore Road,
