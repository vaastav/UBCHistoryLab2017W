the Legislature. As his competency for
the position is undisputed, we can only

Osi of the greatest attractions for
strangers who visit Washington !s a
colored Catholic church, one of the most
costly in the city, and resting upon asol
id financial basis. The choir, all the
singers being colored, is regarded by the
best judges as equal to that of any other
in any city in the couutry and enjoys a
bigh reputation for its artistic and ad
mirable manner of rendering the most
elaborate Masses. II s the custom of
visitors from all parts of tho Union
when in Washington, to go to this
church on Sunday evening, to hear the
singing of vespers, which Is said to be
uusurpassed anywhere. The church is
a preat pet of the Archbishop of Balti
more, who takes a deep interest in the
development and religious advancement
of the colored race.
, Tna Coirniittee on Postcflires in the
lower oraucli of Congies.-i on Friday last
reported a bill reducing the ordinary
letter postage from three to two cents,
M'd in) doubt ia expressed at Washing
ton about its passage during tho present
r.isiot. According to the report of the
Postmaster General, the receipts of the
department for the last fiscal yeir ex
ceeded the disburifcinents i;ear'y a mil
lion aud a half of dollars, which is the
first time in thiity-one years that the
treasury has not been called upon to sup
ply a deficiency. The department, there
fore, being now more than self-sustaining,
the time for a reduction in letter
postage has cotne, and the appropriate
committee in the House has recognized j
me laui. i.'v in" iiit;uuk ucuuii li Jiii-i la-

We print in another part of our paper
the prospectus of the Pittsburg Daily
and Wetlly Post for 1SS3. We have
been a regular and careful reader of the
rst for many, very many years, and thfl
conviction is forced upon U3 that the
older it grows the better it becomes.
There is never any difficulty in telling
its position on any question of public in
terest, for the reason that it never balks
or Ledges, but speaks out boldly and j
fearlessly in f;tvor of what it deems to j
be jiift and true. The Post was a power i
in Wrs'erii Fi nn? y! vania in the late J
campaign, and the value of its services (
is properly appreciated by the Demo
cracy of the entire State. No Demo
crat who can afford it, and who s- poor
that h cannot , ought to enter upon the
new year without first becoming a sub
scriber to the Wftilj Po"t.
Stefijen W. Dorsey, of Star-route
fame, expresses himself with much vig
or and distinctness concerning some of
tbo public men of the day. To a news
paper reporter he said last week, that
the lato Attorney General, Wayne Mac
Veagh, "is a physical, moral and men
si dyspeptic. Everything and everybody
is green to him except himself, and he
Is all purity and goodness." Of burnt
faced Ben Brewster, the present Attor
ney General Mr. Dorsey was pleased to
6ay, "lie is too contemptible and disre
putable a person to le discussed by de
cent person3 in a decent journal. His
beastly drunkenness and coarse profan
ity is a curse to the department of which
he is head." Thi3 is rough on Brews
ter, who regards himself as the Chester
field, as well a-t the "glass of fashion and
the mould of form," of Mr. Arthur's
cabinet.
CnAr.LEs N. Shelley, a Democrat
ic member of Congress from Alabama,
don't seem to have much of a conscience
has shown, in fact, th fit he has none
at all. At the last session his seat was
contested by J. Q. Smith, nho died in
April, 11, before the contest between
th; ni had been determined. The final
result of it was that Shelley's seat was j
declared vacant. At the November
election Shelley was elected for the. un- j
expired term, which means the present j
thioe months session, and he now in- !
i
s'.sts that he is entitled to pay from the
date cf Smith's death, although he has !
received pay for two months of the time.
Thi is simply another instance of the
xesult of a contested seat in Congress,
which is that both the contestant and
feated member are ultimately paid the
full salary, thus making it profitable for
some men to get a nomination and then
be defeated.
There is an encouraging prospect
that the present. Congress will enact a
law that will tear up by the roots the
collection of all mouey from govern
ment employees for political purposes.
A Lill reported a few days ago to the
Senate makes it a crime, with a severe i
penalty attached, f or any person to en- j
ter a public building, for the purpose of j
levying contributions or assessments i
from clerks or other employes. The
shameless operations of Hublx-ll's Con
gressional Committee during the recent
campaign, as well as the brazen impu
dence of Mahone in his daily visits to
the different department", intent upon
the political assessment robbery by which
he sought to bolstrr up his infamous
cause in Virginia, were disgraceful to
the country, aud if the purity of the
ballot-box. upon which the very exist
ence of the Republic mainly depends, is
to be preserved, the collection of money
forcorrpt purposes mu6t La arrested
with a vigorous and ieteTmlned hand.
Gesekal Terry, who is now sta
tioned at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, was
one of the three officers who composed
the Military Board appointed by Presi--dent
Hayes to review the case of Fitz
John Porter, and it will be remembered
that In the light of the new evidence
laid before the Board by General Por
ter's counsel, it completely reversed tb
rinding of the Court martial that had
convicted Porter nearly twenty yeais
ago. It was this new evidence adduced
before ths Board, and its report to the
President based upon it, that led Grant
to make a thorongh investigation of the
case, and afterwards adJress a letter to
President Arthur, in which he frankly
acknowledged the great injustice he had
done to Porter during nineteen years,
and xpressed his firm and undoubted
belief In his innocence. Gen. Terry hav
ing read Gen. Grant's article in the Por
ter case in the December number of the
2forth Americun Review, bas addressed a
letter to him, dated November 19th, of
which the following is an extract :
"As perhaps yon may know, I once, like
youi self, Iwlieved Porter to be guilty. I be
lieved that he had eotmuitedacrime so great
that mere human law could provide no ade
quate punishment for It. But when it be
came my dut v to examine Into the case rare
fuliy I found that I bad grossly erred. I
i found that instead of belnij a criminal he
wa a martyr.
"So believing, It Is a source of very great
satisfaction to me that 1 have borne some
small pnrt In his vindication.
"Looking back over the vears that have
elapsed since I entered the military service,
nothing gives roe so much pleasure than the
fact that I have had some part In the vindi
cation, and I can think of nothing In the fu
ture which would be so grateful to me as to
be able to (to something more in behalf of
one who ha.i suffered so grievously and so
unjustly. While I feel thus, you may Imag
ine the gratification with wlrich I find that
the opinion which I now entertain, that
what I believe to be the cause of truth, of
riirht and or Justice is so strongly supported
by yourself, and you will pardon me, I am
sure, for expressing to vou my feelings."
It has often been conjectured, but
never . accurately known, how much
money Stephen W. Dorsey disbursed in
Indiana in 1SS0 in order to carry the
election for the Republican State ticket
in October, and thus pave the way for
Garfield's election in November. . Dor
sey himself saw lit one day last week to
simplify the matter in an interview with
a newspaper reporter. Ho was asked,
"How much money was used by your
special cunqiittee La Indiana ?" His
answei was, "I think a litte over $100,
OnO," This fund was raised in Phila
delphia and New York at the instance
of that "-Christian Statesman," John
Welch, la'.e Minister to England, and
was liberally subset ibed to by Levi P.
Morton, a rich banker of New York,
who was rewarded by Garfield with the
American mission to France a position
which he still holds. Dorsey also stated
in the interview referred to that to car
ry New Yoik for Garfield required "just
about foiir tiulesas much as in Indiana"
or, in other words about a million and a
half. He said in addition that both
Garfield and Arthur knew perfectly
well about how it was intended to carry
Indiana and New York, and that Gar
field went with Blaine to the celebrated
conference at the Fifth Avenue Hotel,
in New Ynrlr c-; -ust ajter the disas
trous result of tne Maine election, in the
early part of September, at which the
subjict of how to carry the two States
named was fully discussed. Garfield's
admirers are now trying to raise money
to erect an enduring monument to' his
memorv, and if they succeed the friends
of Stephen W. Dorsev, after he "shuf
fles off this mortal coil,'' ought to have
one put up alongside of it.
Iet jus
tice be done though the heavens should
fall."
A Republican paper makes the
statement that "seven BlaineClubs were
organized in this State last week ?" It
is not long since Blaine made the posi
tive announcement through the press,
that in no possible event would he con
sent to become a candidate f or.theliepub
lican nomination for President in 1SS4.
In spite, however, of his own declara
tion, his friends and admirers have an
undoubted right to form Blaine Clubs
in this and every other State, if that
sort of amusement affords them, any
pleasure, as is presumably the case. Of
all the political delusions of the day un
der some one of which men iu both par
ties delight to labor, the one that looks
to the time when James G. Blaine will
be elected to the Presidency is the great
est and the most preposterous. Since
his contest with Grant at the Chicago
convention, in 1880, the chances that he
will ever reach the goal of bis ambition
have been growing small by degrees and
beautifully less, Blaine will never be
President any more than Koscoe Conk
ling or John Sherman.
According to the Lancaster Tntelli
fifneer, that unmitigated scoundrel,
John C. Delaney, drew from the treas
ury in one ear Sl,200 compensation as
Senate librarian, and, in addition, fGOO
for -'services as librarian, recesa Decem
ber 31, 1SS1;" $310 for new desks for
Secretary of Commonwealth s office ;"
?1,315 for "reparing rooms and book ca
ses ;" $ 4-23 for desks, tables, etc., 5908,
02 for "radiators for departments;" 5203
for "safe for stationery department
?1,2.")3 for furnishing desks for depart
ments," $2. 114.75 for "furnishing offices
of the Senate and State Treasury," and
$900 for "postage, labor and express
charges." This is a sample of the reck
less way the people's money is spent at
Harrisburg, and it would be a mere mat
terof coujecture how much of the aggre
gate of these items, over and above his
salary, found its way into Delauey's
pockets. Delaney's diversified occupa
tions will be materially curtailed, we
hope, before the adjournment of the
next Legislature.

private secretary and; Senator Gt rdoa,

Governor at Russ' Grand Hotel, Mr.

left for Philadelphia.
We are glad to state that the Clear

OUR PHILADELPHIA LETTER.
THE FIRST BLIZZARD OF WIXTKR, WITH
WINTER RKFLBCTIOXS, AND A BRIEF
NOTICE OF "CnET's" MESSAGE THE
lordly bob tombs and his traits
of character dead officials,
and the ttse they snould be pct
to, etc., etc.
Philadelphia, Dec. 11, 1882.
Dear McPike A. regular blizzard
bounced down upon ns on Tuesday night
last and has kept biizzarding us ever
since. Well, let it blizzard, but while
it keeps bHzzarding let us not forget the
poor, "Blessed is he that cons'dereth
the poor." Winter is at hanl, and to
many it is a bleak and bitter one. But
the bleaker and bitterer it is the better
opport unities it affords those who have
the grace to bear it the privilege of con
sidering the poor. - The cares of to-morrow
be lightened by the cares of to-day.
Let all remember the beatitude, "Bless
ed is he who considereth the poor."
There are many who need to b consid
ered within the sound of every church
bell, and there are many who could not
do better than to so act as to claim the
beatitude as their own.
It is an exceedingly sad reflection that
the babes of Beecher'a dock will have to J
take their chances of salvation through
the winter. A short time ago he bap
tized fourteen infants in Plymouth
church, making one job ot it, and then
announced that it would be the last lot
he would baptize until the return of
warm weather in May or June next.
Let ns hope that none of the babes of
Beecher's flock will die in the mean
time. As every correspondent baa something
to say about the President's message, I
will perform my duty in that work by
briefly saying : There ia no subsidy
schemes running between its lines, and
no public or private jobs lurking behind
its paragraphs. From beginning to end
there 1a not a line upon which dishonest
hopes could be built. The whole mes
sage is in the interest of honest and
economical government. Bully for
"Chet."
v, GENERAL ROBERT TOOMB3.
I see thatGeneral Robert Toombs nas
been in Washington, and fell into the
hands of interviewers. By one he ia
quoted as saying, "The mission of the
Democratic party , is to work for the
good of the nation ; to work for the na
tional welfare, and let special interests
take care of themselves." There is a
world of meaning in that simple sen
tence. The Democratic party must na
tionalize itself, and Southern Democrats
must iearn that the country has grown
a little since 18G0, and consequently re
quires broader statesmanship to run it.
Bob. Xoomba ia a man after my own
heart. .While he despisea an enemy he
cherishes a friend. General Toombs is
brave, magnanimous and generous to a
fault, and, unlike almost every other
politician, he haa never had the least
ambition for money or prominence in
political life. He is perhaps the only
American in the Union without a coun
try. . While all other Southerners re
newed their allegiance to the, Union,
Toombs remained implicable and defi
ant ; yet he ia to-day one of ita most de
voted, earnest, honest friends.
When General Toombs refused an im
portant position in the Confederate ser
vice and was told that "there were few
men had a chance to take such a posi
tion, his reply was : "Yes, and a d d
sight fewer who would refuse." Gen.
Toombs is a very remarkable man. He
is in many respects the most remarkable
man the South ever produced. He is
kingly in all his ways. Ilia whole pri
vate and political life is unequalled for
nobleness and brilliancy.
DEAD OFFICIALS.
Some steps should at once be taken to
modify thi formalities over dead offi
cials. "With the increasing number of
Senators and Representatives, with the
fast and furious life at the Federal Cap
tal, and with the spreading malaria
which makes ita atmosphere unwhole
some, some? philosophical method should
be applied to the obituary necessities of
Congress. Let the philosophic sugges
tion of old Ben. Franklin be introduced
in Congress in the disposal of its mortu
ary business. Beu. suggested the pro
priety of saying grace over a whole bar
rel of pork once for all, instead of say-
ing it over every fry. Let Congress fix
a day near the close of the session for
the especial purpose of paying funeral
respects to dead members. Like saying
grace over a whole ban-el of pork, they
can at the same time pay funeral respect
to all their dead fellow officials. If Sen
ators and Congressmen die ic ollicewith
out reference to ti me or to the urgency
of public business, a new rule of Con
gress should be adopted for the prompt
disposal of its mortuary business. There
has already been several deaths of mem
bers elect of the next Congress, and
there doubtless will be others before the
end of its first session, so let it prepare
for saying grace over ail of them at one
and the same lime.
Official funeral ostentation has degen
erated into a junketing frolic and, in ex
pensiveness, to the entombment of a
grandee. If the study or anatomy ia a
necessity, I suggest to have the subjects
for dissection limited to officials dying
in office. In that way they can be
made useful after death, and thir cor
ruption would not be greater than in
life. The knife cf the surgeon is pre
ferable to the rot of the grave. Any
decent member of Congress will prefer
the dissecting table to that horrible
Congressional burying ground.
SMALL FAVOR3 THANKFULLY RE
CEIVED. Small favors are to be thankfully re
ceived, and the Tariff Commission re
port, recommending a general reduction
of 20 per cent, in the tariff, is a small
favor which is very thankfully received.
It does seem now as if it were not possi
ble to stop tariff reform. This proposed
reduction by the Commission, however
gratefully received, ia a surprise to the
country, for the leason that the people
know that the Commission was not or
ganized to make such a report, and that
ita verdict ia due to the late elections.
OCR COMING LEGISLATUBE.
Democratic papers sre already stupid
ly trying to raise a sectional issue in the
Democratic ranks over the Speakership
of the next House of Representatives.
Let us hope the House will not be or
ganized this winter as it was in 1975,
when the Democrats obtained their last
Legislative majority. It was then or
ganized under the most approved Re
publican pattern. The election of Pat
terson for Speaker was an inexcusable
blunder, and the selection of rnanv of
the House officials was shameful, while
the whole parliamentary proceeding of
the session was scandalous in the ex
treme. It was a disgrace to the Demo
cracy of the State, and most unfortu
nate for the Democratic party, thtt it
elected a majority of the State Legisla
ture in 1874. God forbid that the com
ing Democratic Legislature should dis
grace the Democracy as did the last
Democratic House.
The egregious blunderiug of a Demo
cratic Legislature in 1875 was the cause
of Democratic disaster at the following
election, as the blundering of the last
Congressional session was disastrous to
the Republican party throughout the
country. Both speakers, Patterson and
Keifer, were clumsy blunderers. Both
were under sinister and dangerousinflu
ences. The imbecility of Speaker Pat
terson and his subserviency to dishonest,
reckless leaders, was disastrous to tbe
Democracy of Pennsylvania, as was
that of Keifer's to the Republicans of
the Union. Both men organized" their
committees In the interest of jobbers,
and both gave a lose rein to bad men
and shameful scenes that disgusted the
9tat and the Natlos. Let their tzam-
pies be the beacons of a mighty warn
ing, to both the Democracy of Pennsyl
vania and that of the Union. Let the
Speaker of the coming Pennsylvania
Legislature be a man of brains and
honor.

Shakspeare said : "The evil that men
do lives after them ; the good is often
interred with the bones." In Garfield's
case the people have reversed Shaks
peare's saying. The newspapers have
ben since Garfield's death full of praisa
of him. Volumes have been written In
praise of Garfield's policy. Just what
that policy was, however, and what was
in it that was praiseworthy, are matters
which they leave to the imagination.
One thing is sure, that the Garfield ad
ministration discovered Mahone, and
gave Mahoneism its confidence and sup
port. If that is praiseworthy let Gar
field worshippers rojoiep.
AN INTERESTING WARFARE.
There Is nothing tame In the wordy
war between the two great sword twist
ers. Grant and Logan, They are now
giving tho public an interesting varia
tion of Silas Wegg's "declining and fall
ing of the Rooshan Empire." Black
John has come out with a six-column
reply to Gift-taker on the Porter case.
Jack is on the rampage. Verbs and ad
jectives will hae to stand from under.
The shows of the season are said to be I
tam. This is going to beat the mins
trels. This is jolly. By the way, it
will not be thought out of place I hope to
say that the notorious conduct of the
Chinese troois in Corea leads to the
suspicion that they are rapidly becom
ing naturalized, which fact is doubtless
connected with Grant's late visit to the
Chinese Empire.
INTERESTING GOSSIP.
It is not true, as Teported, that Oscar
Wilde hadn't his hair, and that his
shorn locks were distributed among bis
female cquaintances, to b worked up
into Florentine trinkets. But it ia true
that "Cbet." is afraid to remove Cork
hill, because Corkhill ia akin to the Su
preme Court, or rather to the Judge
Millar part of it. It ia also true that
brother Talmaere has permanently re
tired from thebnsiness of manufacturing
Kangaroo Presidential tickets, and it is
due to the people that he has made pub
lic proclamation of the fact. It will be
joyful intelligence to the readers of the
Freeman to learn that General Grant
has lately manifested great interest in
Dr. Newman's discourses. His best
friends say that at first he Invariably

given an equivalent in cash. On Monday
afternoon the men will be marshaled In line
in the shop yard, and as each passes throutrh

Merion Square, is in many respects a very
remarkable one. It will imitate the crow

It can also speak a few short words, sueh as

crow goes where it pleases without restraint
and is on terms of intimacy with the cat and

years, and although perfectly free to come

sons, embrac!ng many of the leading Demo-
.,. of v.W'York. as well as of the adjoin-
the kindness of yonr welcome, when I am
reminded of the circumstances which eive
rise to this reunion a sense of grave respon
aibillty weighs upon me and tempers every
other sentiment. . We stand to-night in the
full glare of a crand and brilliant manifesta
tion of popular will, sad. In tbe light of it,
how vain and small appear the tricks of pol
iticians and tbe movements of partisan ma
chinery I He must be blind who cannot sea
that tlie people well understand their pow
er and are determined to use It when their
rights and interest are threatened. There
should he no skepticism as to the strength
and perpetuity of onr popular government.
Parties and leaders have learned, too, that
the people will not unwittlnely and hllndiy
follow aud that something more" than unmean
lng devotion to party Is necessary to secure
their allegiance. I am quite certain, too,
that ths late demonstration did not spring
from any pre-existing love for the party call-
ed to power. Kor did the people place the.
affairs or state in our Hands to be ry them
i forgotten. They voted for themselves and
j their own interests.
I "If we letain their confidence we mnst de
serve It, and we may be sure thev will call
on us to give an acconnt of our stewardship.
We shall utterly fail to read aright tne signs
of the times, if we are not fully convinced
that the paities are but tbe instruments
through which the people work their will
and that when they become less or more the
people desert or destroy them. The van
quished have lately learned these things'
and the victors wiii act wisely if they profit
by tbe lesson. I have heard and read much
of late touching the reat responsibility that
has been cast upon me. and it is certainly
predicated upon the fact that my majority
was so large as to indicate that "many not
members of my partv supported me." God
knows how fully I appreciate the responsi
bility of the high office to which 1 have been
called, and how much I sometimes feel that
I cannot bear the burden well. It seems to
me, however, that the citizen who hss been
chosen by his fellows to discharge public du
ties owes no less or more to them, whether he
was elected by a small or large majority. In
either event he owes to the people who hon
ored Mm his best endeavors to carefully pro
tect their rights and further their interests.
But if it is merely intended to remind me
that as a member of a party, attached to its
principles, and annions for its continued su
premacy, my cond uct should be such as to
nive hope and confidence to those that are
with us, I have to say that this responsibil
ity should be shared by all the fmembers of
the party. An administration is only suc
cessful iu a partisan sense when It appears
to be the outgrowth aud result of party prin
ciples. Men who lead and others who follow
should all strive to commend to the people
in this, the time of our opportunity, not an
administration alone, but a party which
shall appear fully adequate tq their wants
and useful to their purposes. The time-hon
ored doctrines of the party are dear to me.
If honestly applied, I know the affairs of
governmeut wwuld be honestly and fittingly
administered, and I believe all the wants and
needs of the people would he met. They
have survived all chances. Let ns hold
them as a sacred trust, and let us not forget
that an intelligent people will look to the
party they put in power to supply all their
various wants and needs, and the "party that
keeps pace with the developments and pro
gress of the time, whir-h keep in sight its
landmarks and yet observes those things
which are In advance, and which will contin
ue true to the people as well as to Its tradi
tions, will be the dominent party of the fu
ture. In conclusion, may I Bespeak for my
sHT your kind support and consideration?
My only aspiration is faithfully to perform
the duties of the office to which the people
of my State have called me. 1 hope and
trust that personal endeavor will light the
way to a successful administration."

Graw, aped 9 years, suffering witli;sratl-pox
and nearly frozeu, was found lying in an open
yard of Ia house in South Baltimoro early
Friday morning. The case was at once re
ported to the nealth Office, and when In
spector Brown reached the scene he found
the child lying prone upon its back and near
ly naked. Its only covering being a few filthy
rags. The ground was fror.en hard, while
under and around tha child were several
pools of water covered with ice. The child,
benumbed and unable to utter a word, was
placed in the ambulance and taken to the
Quarantine Hospital. It was afrerwaid
learned that the mother of the child, who
lies in the neighborhood, on discovering that
the child had the small-pox, sent her out in
the cold to find a shelter wherever she could,
and it is thought that the child wandered
about until, benumbed by the cold, she en-
I terd the yard to seek shelter, but, fearing to
ak admission to the house, fainted from ex-
posure. The mother, on being told of the
case, said that she "had no time to fool with
her," that she "had a place out at service
which paid her better than looking after a
child with the small pox." The Health
Commissioners will prosecute the mother to
the full extent of the law.

At a recent meeting of the overseers of
Harvard College, a discussion was held up
on a resolution which has been before the
board for several weeks, that In the opinion
of this board, the statutes making attend

The board, by a strong vote, refused to
adopt the resolution. But Mr. George Shif

The San Diego (Cal.) Svn says that the
horseshoer employed by Henry Koster, at his
blacksmith shop on F street made a discovery
the other day which, though vnche' for by
the most responsible parties, seems almost
Impossible of belief. A staid old family nag
belonging to William Jones, was brought to
the shop to be reshod . The hoofs had grown
very long, leaving hollow grooves beneath
their outer rims. On cnttingaway this shell
to make a foundation for the shoe a hole was
noticed underneath and the attention of Mr.
Koster was called to it. At length what was
their astonishment to find fclx young living
mice cosily nestled within the hollow disc.
How tbey got there so safely Is a question.

Holiday Goods
at
Wanamaker's.
One quarter in the store U
peculiarly a Holiday quarter,
a gift quarter; a place where
just a little use is made the
vehicle for a great deal of
luxury. It is full now; full
of wonders; full of pretty
tilings; full of silly thinrs";
fuil of surprises; full of what
nobody expects; full of what
everybody expects; full, asu
has been full near Christmas
time before.
Beginning at the very cen-'
tre ot the store, next north
are two counters, one of
them very large, and one
half as large, filled to over
flowing with perfumeries and
other toilet articles and
implements. We positively
must not begin to mention
names,- nor even classes.
The only way to get away
from these miraculous things
is to break away.
Next northwest ia a col
1 ction of small things that
people used to luxury v:-Vi
recognize under the name
small leather articles. Aboiii
the biggest thing' there 'is a
portfolio or writing-case.
Tocketbooks are the com
monest. Hut such pocket
books! Oh, yes you c:"
L 't good substantial pocket
boks there, with not a cent
of extravagance in th'-m ;
but naturally we are thinking
r.f the brighter ones. Leather
isn't fine enough. They must
enamel it, paint it, deck it
out with silk and shininrr fcil
vcr and gold. Ever)' year
people get worse and worse,
l ivery year they must have
ranger and stranger things.
Silk, p!uh, velvet and ft::
Lugs, are there, with all tliei
pretty and handy and cun
ning fastenings. But v.e
must hurry on. J5
Next northwest are writing-papers.
Here's room
for a treatise. We're not
going to stop. But anybody
who passes that white-looking
inland of trade in the sa
cf people, without finding
out what IVanamaker Best
means, in or out of Holiday
:time, is a loser. What a
glory has a page of pure
paper I
Photograph albums are
next on northwest; and here
the circle widens. Is ail
tliat long row photograph
albums ? Is it possible that
so many people didn't buy
albums last year, when v.e
brought over a ship-load
almost? There's a new set
of people this year, may be.
At least the photographers
haven't gone out ol business.
At this end are velvet
frames ; yonder are boxes
of leather and plush. You
can pay .6o for a box that a
touch will spoil. Don't sup
pose that the things put out
to show, even under glass,
are the fine ones. Whisper
to the saleswoman that your
pocket is full of money, and
that you are aching to get
rid of it.
Brass and bronze! Oh,
see the mob of brasses and
bronzes. Open your dic
tionary. The first word you
come to has its image there.
Preposterous things I Have
your wits about you. An
artist has studied out -every
one. The artist is a wag too;
for jokes abound ; little
touches of humor and broad
farces. So there is pathos;

course often thousand things
in a shop, each of which was
born of Art?
