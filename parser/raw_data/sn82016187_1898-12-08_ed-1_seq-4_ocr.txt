According to agreement -we announce
"below in this is3ue the names and ad
dresses of the winners of the splendid
extra premium prize, the terms of which
were set forth in this column the last
week in October.
It will be remembered that the prizes
consists of a two-volume unabridged dic
tionary, bound in full morrocco; and
.that the reward was the same to the
first, second and third contestants who
would send us! the largest clubs mailed
during November.
F
The successful competitors are : Win.
6rr, Crary, Is. Dak., for a club of 41 ;
H. McGee, Iron ton, O., for a club of 37 ;
Levi Morris, Crescent City, Cal., for a
.club of 31.
We refer any of our readers who are
interested to these club-raisers as to the
value and character of the prize we are
Bending them, and we venture to hope
that they will kindly answer any in
quiries made on the subject.
ANOTHER CONTEST.
As many will no doubt be disap
pointed in not being able to enter the
competition, we take thi3 occasion to
announce now that we will give the
same prizes upon the same terms in
another contest, in which a little more
time will be allowed.
"We will send, as an extra premium,
in addition to all other premiums, a
set of this same two-volume, morrocco
bound, unabridged dictionary to each
of the three persons who will send us
the greatest number of yearly sub
scribers to The National, Tribune
between Dec 10 and Jan. 31, 1899. The
dates to be determined by the postmark
on the envelope at the postoffice where
letters are mailed.
"We trust that there will be a lively
contest for this magnificent set of books,
the publisher's price of which is $2G.
South Dakota is to try the South
Carolina Dispensary system. This is
hopeful. They will try it there more
intelligently than was possible under the
wild-eyed Tillman, and probably get
,6ome results which will be of value in
solving the Temperance problem. The
system has worked very well in Scandi
navian countries, and possibly will do
so in South Dakota. The people of the
whole country will watch its operations
-with deep interest
Gen. Leonard Wood is giving the
people of Santiago a most refreshing ex
perience in a Governor who is not there
to fill his own pockets, and those of his
henchmen, in the quickest possible time,
and return home, but is really desirous
of building up their city, and giving
them all a chance to prosper. Such, a
thing ha3 never before happened in the
three centuries of the city's history, and
it must fill them with amazement
The President's Message is not what
one would call an exciting document.
It has about as few startling features in
it as the annual report of a grander
railroad.
The islands are to be ours, but not
of us. Those who talk fearfully about
their becoming States only show their
own ignorance of all the conditions.
It will be at least a century before any
body seriously thinks of making States
of them.
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ISLANDS.
The most pressing duty upon Con
gress is that of providing for the
Government of our newly-acquired
possessions. Something has to be done
at once, for the President's war powers
will terminate with the signing of the
treaty of peace, and what is done there
after by his orders in Cuba, Porto Eico
and the Philippines will be warranted
by the law of necessity rather than by
any strictly legal authority. But
strenuous as we have always been in
strict adherence to the letter of the law
"in such cases made and provided,"
yet where there was no law, or where
die law was plainly insufficient, we have
been very unanimous in sustaining our
Presidents in doinff whatever was
thought necessary to be done. This has
been a great astonishment to the
publicists of the old world. They have
seen the freest people in the world, and
those most jealous of their freedom,
applaud their President for exercising
powers that a Europen monarch might
not.
Undoubtedly, the people of the
United Stales and Congress would be
well content to let President McKinlcy
go on governing the islands as he might
see fit, through such officers as he should
appoint, until at least we could be better
informed as to what is the best thing to
do.
So far both Senators and Representa
tives have been singularly silent as to
what our colonial policy should be.
Yet something must be done before this
Congress adjourns three months from
now, or an extraordinary session of the
Fifty-sixth Coii"i ess must be cal led to
do it. The law increasing the military
establishment expressly limited its ope
ration to the existence of the war.
When the Spaniards Hgn the -treaty of
peace, which will be within a few days,
the reduction of the army must begin.
Tiiis will dej rive the President not only
of the men who are needed to maintain
our authority," but the officers who must
fur the' lime administer the Govern
ments of those islands. If, as seems
likely, the better way would be to con
tinue purely military Governments for
some years, until the situation develops
more clearly, then the President should
be given powers necessary to that policy,
and such an increase of the rank and
file of the army as will make the Gov
ernments effective in the highest degree.
We have promised the world that we
shall give those peoples Governments
which shall protect person and property
and be just, vigorous and highly devel
opmental. The administration by Gen. Wood of
the City and Province of Santiago has
fully met that promise, and more than
justified expectations. That of Gen
Brooks in Porto Pico seems to have been
satisfactory, and it is not unlikely that
Congress may think that the best thing
to do is to extend the same system
throughout, and content itself by
authorizing the President to do so, and
giving him the means. In this way it
may adjourn any decisive adoption of a
colonial policy over for a year, leaving
the next Congress, which will have
gained fuller knowledge, to deal with
the situation.
In many respects this would seem to
be the better way. We shall make a
great mistake if we attempt to apply
general principles, derived from the
Government of this country, "to that of
those islands. We must take a leaf out
of the book of England's experience,
and deal with each people according to
their character and conditions. What
mar suit Cuba may not suit Porto Rico
or the Philippines at all, and vice versa.
England does not attempt to govern any
two of her dependencies precisely alike.
She simply insists on maintaining the
essentials of good Government in all of
them, and beyond that lets each fol low
its natural bent In one way or another
she secures to each one of them peace,
liberty, justice and protection of person
and property, and then interferes no
further with them. She governs Egypt
one way and India another, and differ
ent sections of India different ways.
Canada, Australia, New Zealand and
South Africa govern themselves most
absolutely in everything but in name.
The experiment of allowing Jamaica
self-government" resulted disastrously,
and its right to do so was taken away.
We shall simply have to follow Eno--land's
example, and by actual trial find
out just what form of Government is
suited to each people.
President McKinley's long-heralded
Civil Service order still hangs fire,
though we are kept in hourly expecta
tion of it
LAWYERS AS RULERS.
When one studies comprehensively
die history of this country he is aston
ished at the part that lawyers have had
in its Government. From the remote
past countries have been ruled by sol
diers or priests, but the United States
has been 'from the first the especial do
main of "gentlemen of the long robe
In the first place. 18 out of the 24 Presi
dents were regularly bred to the law.
Of the six exceptions, Washington was
a surveyor and planter; Win. H. Harri
son began life as a student of medicine,
but found the career of arms more con
genial ; Taylor and Grant were regular
soldiers; Garfield studied law, but did
little if anything at its practice, being
rather a teacher, professor, minister, sol
dier, and politician ; while Johnson was
a tailor before he entered politics. Of
the 18 regularly-bred lawyers Jeffer
son, Madison, Monroe, J. Q. Adams,
Fillmore, Pierce, and McKinley be
came involved in politics before they
had achieved much success at the
bar; but Jackson, Van Buren, Tyler,
Polk, Hayes, Arthur, and Cleve
land were good lawyers, and John
Adams, Abraham Lincoln, and Benja
min Harrison were really great lawyers,
and had commanding positions at the
bar before their election as President.
Andrew Jackson was quite as suc
cessful at the bar as a young man as he
was at fighting the Indians and British,
planting, shipping, and manufacturing.
James Buchanan made a fortune at
the bar before he went actively into
politics. Polk was a painstaking, in
duMrious lawyer to the end of his days.
Aitluir returned to the practice of law
in New York whenever his official terms
expired, and had a fairly lucrative
practice. Harrison . has been over
whelmed with big cases ever since he
left the White House. Cleveland had
a fine practice in New York City await
ing him when his first term ended, but
since his second term he has seemed to
care for nothing but his family and
duck-hunting.
Of 85 present Senators, GO are law
yers, four are merchants, two are mine
operators, one is a physician, one a
professional office-holder, one a literary
man, three are journalists, four are
farmers and stockbreeders, one a capi
talist and. director in moneyed institu
tions, four are manufacturers, and two
are bankers. There is about the same
proportion of lawyers in the House of
Representatives, and this has been the
case ever since the formation of the
Government
The problem of the Philippines is
the most serious one now confronting us.
It is possible that it may be necessary
to give Aguinaldo and his army a sharp
lesson that we are now the actual lords
of the archipelago, and that we mean
serious business. They have been so
used to the rule of force that they
understand nothing else, and we may
have to show them that we have the
force, and stand ready to use it A
single demonstration will be enough,
however, and after it is made, and we
introduce the Government that we shall,
there will be probably little trouble.
The main thing will be to have abroad
minded, capable, firm man in command,
who will have tact enough to under
stand the Filipinos, and humor them in
non-essentials, while insisting upon their
rigid observance of the essentials of
peace, honesty, and absolute justice.
When they understand that all we
want of them is that they shall not kill
one another, shall not rob nor oppress
one another, and that the light taxes
imposed upon them are for their own
benefit, things will go on smoothly.
There may be occasional conflicts with
banditti and pirates, for bandittism and
piracy have been esteemed professions
in some of the islands for thousands of
years. But this will be good exercise
for our' younger officers, and really
amount to little more than the troubles
the police have with the disorderly ele
ments in our large cities.
,The Spaniards do not propose to
leave anything in Cuba that they can
carry off. Capt-Gen. Castellanos tried
to loot the Spanish Bank of Habana of
$850,000 cash last Sunday, and as it
was unwise to trust any of his subordi
nates with so much cash, he conducted
the job in person, and pulled open the
money-drawers himself. But the Presi
dent has thoughtfully requested the
depositors, a few days before, to tem
porarily remove their deposits, and the
Captain-General found the vaults as
empty as Mother Hubbard did her
J cupboard.
THE TREATY OF PEACE.
The work of tne. Peace Commission is
nearly over, apd jjie treaty will be ready
for signature in' a few days. All the
substantial pdints'were settled last week,
and there remains only a number of
minor questions, -such as the status of
the Spaniards who choose to remain in
the islands, trade privileges, religious
rights, status of the monkish orders, the
release and return of the Spanish prison
ers held by the Filipinos, ownership
of vessels and munitions of war in
parts not captured by the Americans,
etc Tho Americans, having gained all
the main points, are disposed to be
liberal on the minor ones, but the
Spaniards try their patience severely by
their quibbling and sharp struggling for
every possible advantage. They in
sisted that a number of conditions did
not belong to the treaty, since not men
tioned in the protocol, but Judge Day,
who had become very tired of their
chop-logic, laid down the broad prin
ciple :
" A treaty of peace can contain any
thing which the victors put into it"
The Spaniards saw the point, and suc
cumbed. It seems likely that the proposition to
buy one of the Caroline Islands may
fail. The American Commissioners
have not been strenuous upon it, but
have maintained an attitude of "We
have mado you a good offer: take it or
reject it." The Spaniards wanted to
savo their munitions of war, but the
Americans insisted that they belonged
to the victors, and went with the rest
TnE program of the Navy Depart
ment is in accordance with our tradi
tions to build what ships we do bigger
and stronger than their same class in
other navies. It is for three battleships
of 13,500 tons? each; or 3,212 tons more
than the Oregon ; three armored cruisers
of about 12,000 tons each, or nearly
r? '.
4,000 tons more -than tho big New
York ; three protected cruisers of about
6,000 tons each, or nearly 1,000 tons
more than the largest protected cruisers
we now have and :six; smaller cruisers
of about 2,500 tons; each. All of these
are to have i the greatest speed, the
highest coal - stowage and the most
powerful gun3 that can be given them.
Without armor,.or .armament the battle
ships are to cost -$3,600,000 each, the
first-class armored cruisers $4,000,000,
the protected cruisers $2,150,000, and
the smaller cruisers $1,141,000. Fitted
out, it means an expenditure of about
$50,000,000. First-class war-ships come
high, but there is no use having any
other.
TriERE was a report current .last
week that we had demanded from Spain
the concession of a station for naval and
telegraph purposes at Ceuta, the strong
hold opposite Gibraltar, and that she
had refused. This was subsequently
fully denied. If we were to have to
communicate with tho Philippines bv
way of the Mediterranean and the Suez
Canal, a station at Ceuta, or some other
point on the Mediterranean, would be
very necessary to us. But we propose
to have cables to Manila across the
Pacific, and to dig the Nicaragua Canal,
so that we shall be entirely independent
of the eastern channel of communica
tion. It will hardly be possible to give
Porto Rico as full a measure of self
government as Hawaii, for the reason
that the people thero have nothing like
the education in self-government that
the missionaries have given the Hawaii
ans for the last three-quarters of a
century. The dominant class in Porto
Rico has known nothing but Spanish
tyranny, and have hardly the faintest
glimmer of Aiqprican ideas and methods.
It will take a longtime to educate even
them in our ways; i The great mass of
the people arq negroes but lately en
franchized, and a large portion of them
brought directly efrom Africa. They
are inconceivajblyj.below the most igno
rant of our So'titlidPh field-hands in gen
eral intelligence qud knowledge of the
ways of civiliiatidtf.
. n;
TnE Government of Hawaii seems
pretty well settled -upon, and the only
point likely to raise discussion is that of
continuing the contract labor system.
This Congress will probably not allow,
and the planters are in a-measure ex-,
pecting it, while contending tojje al
lowed its benefits for a stated term of
years. The form of Government will
be that of one our Terriiories, with the
Governor and most of the higher offi
cials appointed from Washington, pref
erence being given to actual residents
of the islands. This will satisfy the
people of this country, and those of the
archipelago.

Si Klcgg and his elinm Shorty, whose
adventures as recruits and veterans liavo for
so long amused the comrades and many
others, visit Si's home, and on the return
trip are detailed to aid in "getting into
shapo " a number of recruits, gathered in
Indiana by niembera of the regiment on that
duty. All take tho train for the front
again. They reach the field of Chickamauga
in time to make a brief stand against a force
of tho enemy pnrsning a number of fugi
tives. After tho repulso of the rebels, fai
and his friends go on to the front.
End of the Rattle of Clilckamaiica.
Lieut Bowersox, Si, Shorty and the re
cruits left the woods and entered a large
clearing, in tho midst of which was a log
cabin, with a few rude outbuildings. Over
it flow the yellow flag of thchospital service,
and beyond could bo seen the parked traiii3
and other evidences of the immediate rear
of the line-of-battle.
Tho roar of the battle would have told
them a3 much, for it was now deafeaning.
The earth seemed to throb, and the trees
shake with the awful shocks. As they passed
the hospital they paw a grewsome pile of am
putated legs and arms, while the ground
around about was filled with wounded, whose
groans pierced through the roar of battle.
James Bradshaw and Simeon hcelwright,
the two tall, stalwart men who had stood on
the right and who had shown great coolness
during the light, gave one look at the dis
membered limbs, turned pale as death,
gasped, and fell in a faint.
''Forward! Can't stop to pay attention
to them," commanded tho Lieutenant, in
whom tho battle-fever was burning.
Tliongh still more than two miles from" the
low crest of Snodgrass Hill, where Gen.
Thomas, with the remainder of the Army of
the Cumberland, was standing savagely at
bay against the fierce assaults of Bntgg's and
Longstreet's overwhelming numbers, they
were boon in the midst of tho wild ruck and
confusion of the rear of a great battle. Allies
of wagons were being urged hither and yon,
sometimes in accordance with intelligent
orders by officers, more often from the
panicky lears of wagonmasters and teamsters;
riderless horses with saddles under their
bellies were galloping frantically around;
squads of artillerymen in search of ammu
nition wero storming about, cursing cow
ardly teamsters, whom they could not find;
streams of wounded men were trying to
make their way to the hospitals; officers were
yelling and swearing in their attempts to
rally shirks and cowards who had fled from
the fiont; men from regiments which had
been broken and scattered by the fierce as
saults were trying to find their colors; col
onels whose regiments had been ordered up
from the rear uere fiercely forcing their way
forward, with many dire objurgations on all
who impeded their progress.
It was a scene to discourage any but the
stoutest heart, yet it only wrought up the
boys to greater eagerness to get through to
the firing-line.
The smoke-crowned crest of Snodgrass Uill
was soon but half a mile away. They could
make out the ragged, irregular lino of blue
constantly vailing itself in sulphurous vapor
as it poured murderous volleys into the
enemy. The shrill yell of the rebels as they
renewed the charge, and the deep-toned cheer
of the Union soldiers as they repulsed it,
reached their ears in the momentary lulls of
the firing.
So far, in spite of all deterronts, they had
brought every man throngh except the two
who had fainted at the hospital. Everyone
had shown true metal. Little Abel Waite
had particulaily distinguished himself by
skilful dodging under wagons and past Hanks,
in order to keep up with the swift pace of the
longer-legged men.
They had as yet found no one in all the
throng to give them the least information as
to their regiment, when Si spied a member
of Co. Q walking deliberately back, holding
the wrist of his shattered left hand m his
right, with his lingers compressing the artery
to restrain the flow of blood.
"There's Silas Peckham," exclaimed Si,
running up to him. "Badly hnrt, Sile?"
"No,M answered Silas, more coolly than if
he had stubbed bis toe. "Left hand's gone
on a strike. That's all. "Wisht I could find
a doctor to fix it up sol could git back to the
hoys. They're bavin' an awful tussle up
there, an' need me bad. Better hurry up, Si.
Don't waste no time on me. I'll find a doc
tor boon an' be back with you."
' Where's the regiment, Sile? "asked the
Lieutenant.
"Kight up there to the left o' them tall
hickories," answered Silas, pointing with his
bloody hand. " To the right o' that battery
you see there. That's our bully old battery
at work. Greatest battery in tho army. I've
kept my eye on tho place, because I want to
git back as soon's I kin find the Surgeon.
Aiut much Idt o' the regiment, or the bat
tery either, for that matter; but they're rais
in' hell with the Johnnies every time, and
don't you forgit it. Capt. McGillicuddy's iu
command."
"Capt. McGillicnddy?" said the Lieuten
ant. "Why, he's the junior Captain iu the
regiment."
"He was yisterday mornin', but he's now
senior to everybody that's alive," answered
Silas. " The Kunnel wuz .killed yisterday
forenoon. The Lootenant-Kunnel held out
abuut three hours an' then he got it for keeps,
an' tho Major tuck command an' stuck out
till nigh evening, when they knocked him.
"This mornin' the Captains 's bin going
down so fast that I couldn't keep track of
'em, till Capt. McGillicnddy was the only
one left, an' he's swearin' that the rebels
never run no bullet that could hit him.
The Adjutant's acting Lootenant-Kunuel an'
Major both to-wunst, and shootin' a gun
when he haint nothin' else to do. But the
boys that's left's stayers, I tell you. They've
jest stuck their toe-nails into that hill-top
thero an' every time them howlin7 rebels
come yippin' an' ki-yi-in' out o' the woods
they send 'em back on the dead rnn. But
they want you up theic bad. You've got
more than's left in the regiment. Hurry up.
I'll be back with you jest as soon's I kin git
a doctor to cooper me up a little."
"Forward Quick time March ! " shout
ed the Lieutenant. "Guide ou those tall
hickories."
Onward they rushed full into the smoke
that drifted backward down the hill. As
they gained the crest the air became clearer,
and they saw the sadly-shrunken remnant of
their regiment strung in an irregular line
along the forward edge. Some were binding
up won nils more or less severe, some were
searching the boxes of the dead and wounded
for cartridges, some were leaning ou their hot
gnus, looking curiously into the woods at
the foot of the slope into which the rehels
had iled.
Every face was blackened with powder
almost beyond lecognition. The artillery
men to the left weio feverishly swabbing out
their guns and tr'ing to cool them off, and
bringing up everything in the shape or am
munition fiom the limbeis in the rear.
Capt. McGillicnddy was- leaning on his
sword at the right of the line, intently
watching everything. He looked sharply
around, wheu the men raised a cheer ou
rl
I mm
recognizing Si and tho rest, and coming
back shook Lieut. Bowersox warmly by the
hand, saying:
" Great God, Lientenant, I've always been
glad to see yon, but I never was so glad to
see a man in my life as I am you this min
ute. 'How many men did you bring?"
"I'vo got 123 with mc," answered the
Lieutenant. " What's the situation ? "
" You have? "Well, you've got more than
we have IcfU You'll act as Major. Poor
Wilkinson just got his dose. You can sec
him l.ving down there in rear of the lelt.
Put your men in anywhere. Mix them up
with the others. It don't matter much about
formation. Tho main thing's to stand and
shoot. The rebels havo been charging us all
afternoon, but we havo whipped them back
overy time.
" You can see our work ont there (point
ing to the slope in front, which was literally
covered with dead and wounded). I've
thought every time that they couldn't stand
another such a slaughter, but they've rallied
in thoso woods thero and come out ngaiu
with their infernal yell, just as before. The
last time it seemed to me that we just swept
them off the face of the earth, and I don't
see how in God's namo they can stand any
more of that sort of thing. It's worso
killing than wo uave them at Stone Itiver.
It seems to me that hell has lot out for noon,
and sent all it devils to reinforce them.
But it will aoon be night now, when they'll
havo to stop. If they don't we'll havo to de
pond on the bayonet, for we haven't five
rounds apiece left, and I can't get more any
where." Si and Shorty had been distributing the
detachment along the line, and had posted
tho Englishman and his squad of Irishmen,
with themselves, around the tattered colors,
which were now iu the hand3 of tho last sur
vivor of the Color Guard, who was himself
wounded. .
Dusk was fast coming on, when the woods
beyond the foot of the slope began to darken
again with masses of men arraying in column
of assault.
" They're coming again," called ont Capt.
McGillicuddy. "Lieut. Bowersox. lookout
there for the left. Men. if we haven't stormed
them wheu we've fired our last shot, we'll
fix bayouets and charge them. We must
keep them off this hill or die right here."
He was answered with cheers. A demoniac
yell from 10,000 fierce throats rang through
the woods, aud the next instant thunder and
flames burst from the sweeping crescent of
rebel cannon, aud the ground in front of the
foot of the hill was hidden from view by the
tide of men rushing over it.
A fierce storm of can Hon and musketry
answered from the crest of the hill. As they
reloaded, Si and Shorty saw in quick glances
that tho rebel line to tho right and left
seemed beaten to a standstill by the terrific
storm which fell upon them, but in their im
mediate front a body of men, apparently a
regiment, kept stubbornly forging forward.
Upon tueir hag, held gallantly aloft, could
be made out the letters " Miss."
By the time every shot in the cartridge
boxes had beeu fired at them they had forced
their way half-up the slope.
"Attention, 200th Indiana," shouted
Capt. McGillicnddy. " Dress on the colors.
Fix bayonets."
"They'uus 's Injiannian3," shouted the
rebel Color-Sergeant, waving his flag de
fiantly. " Como on, you Uoosiers. We'uus
'a Misiissippiaus. .Remember Buny Yisty.
Injiannians 's cowards."
"Shorty, Ie's have that ere flag," said Si.
"Le's,"said Shorty, pushing around th
the
ring that locked his bayonet on
"Forward March! Charge!" shouted
Capt. McGillicuddy.

Shorty had anything but a delirious remem
brance. They could only recollect the fierce
rush and the lightning-like play of bayonet
and gnn-barrel in the storm-center around
the rebel colors. Each after an instant's
savage fencing had sent his bayonet home in
his opponent's body. Si had sprung at and
seized the rebel colors, only to fall, as he
grasped them, from a bullet out of the
revolver of a rebel Captain, whom Shorty
instantly bayoneted, and fell himself from a
blow across the head with a musket-barrel.
The man who struck him was bayoneted
bj' Abel Waite, who was dancing around the
edges of the melee like a malignant little
fiend, prodding wherever he could get a
chance at a rebel body. The Irishmen, yell
ing like demons, were using their gunslike
shillelahs, and crushing heads in every direc
tion, while Wat Bnrnham had thrown his
musket aside, aud was rushing at everybody
with his mighty fists.
At length the rebels fled, leaving the In
diauiaus in possession of their colors and
the hillside.
"Some of you find Lieut. Bowersox, and
bring him here," said Capt. McGillicnddy,
sitting np, and beginning to twist a hand
kerchief around his thigh, to form a torni
quet. " Lieutenant, you all right?"
"sy " Nothing more than a mere scratch on the
side of my head," said the Lieutenant, wip
ing away the blood.
"Well, Lieutenant, you'll have to take
command of tho regiment. I had a personal
altercation with that Mississippi Colonel
lying over there, and he put a bullet through
my thigh. Get the men together, pick up
our wounded, and fall back to the top of the
hill again."
" I'm afraid there's no use of picking up
Corp'l Klegg and Shorty," said the Lieuten
ant, with tears in lrrS" eyes. "They got the
rebel flag, but they're lying there stiff and
cold."
" Well, bring them back, anyway, so we
can lay them beside the other gallant boys
who have fallen to-day."

Miles Buck, Co. K, 50th Pa., Lockbox
177, Tyrone, Pa., writes: "There seems to be
a controversy as to what regiments formed
the Second aud Third Brigades, First Divis
ion, Ninth .Corps. I am sure there was no
more honor attached to the Second Brigade
than to the First or Third. The boys of the
First Division were a gallant sot. As near
"as 1 can remember, the following formed the
First Division, Ninth Corns, First Brigade:
27th Mich., 10th, olst aud "l09th N. Y., 37th
and 38th Wis., 51st Pa. Second Brigade: 1st
Mich. Sharpshooters, 2d, 8th and 20th Mich.,
46th N. Y., 00th Ohio and 50th Pa. Third
Brigade: 3d Ind., 5Lst. 57th and 59th Mass.,
14th N. Y. and 100th Pa. The 112th Pa. II.

to the Second Brigade part of the Summer

Editor National Tribune: All honor
should be accorded tofThe National Trib
une as the champion for upholding tho
rights of the veterans, the men who never
rode in palace cars, and if by accident
during their hard marches they hap
pened to get a ride on a cattle or box-car
they were accused' of putting on style.
Now a few words for our young comrades'
ears by one who saw some hard service.
I do not class all our new volunteers as
grumblers, but there are many who did
not realize that there was a difference
between war and homo with mother's
cooking, nursing, and feather-bed, and, if
I mistake not, mother was always grum
bled at for all the-little, petty grievances
of home.
Not long ago I read a letter from a lady
who spoke of the "neglect of our soldiers
as a National disgrace" I well remem
ber once, when I had been sick with tho
mumps in the hospital tent for a week",
the order came to march, when the tenfc
was torn down from over my head. It
was raining; I had no protection out a
wool blanket. It nearly cost me my life
I did not lay it up to the Administration, but
to the negligence of one under-otticeranct
spite of another.
During the early Winter months of 1863
we were camped at Milliken's Bend,-near
Vicksburg. It rained most of tho time;
wood was scrace, and mud unfathomable.
The health of the troops was fearful. At
times nearly one-half were unfit for duty.
It was all we could do to stand picket and
care for the sick. At one time most of tho
wood had to be brought on our backs from
the timber, three miles from the river. It
was a dailv occurrence to see the pickets,
as they had been relieved from duty,
come into camp bearing a stick of wood,
which was carefully split into kindling
and put under the head for a pillow, to
keep dry, to be used sparingly to cook
coffee and meat for the next 24 hours.
Soldiering was not play in '63. C. W.
