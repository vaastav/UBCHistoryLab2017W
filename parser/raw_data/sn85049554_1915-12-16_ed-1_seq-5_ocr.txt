TROUBLE AGAIN jbREWING OVER
/j»WJ AND PAWNfilR^
RATES.
PROTESTS TO FORCE^i%'^S:vV&i
large element of the public, over the
increases In freight rates, coupled with
increasing passenger rates, is the
souroe of the difficulty.
Members of house and senate who
are known to be students of the rail
road situation and familiar with it are
getting protests in one form and an
other. Various things are occurring
calculated to bring the railroad ques
tion to the front in congress.
President Urges Inquiry,
j. In iis annual message, President
Wilson urged that before there be any
I further legislation touching the inter
state commerce laws a commission of
inquiry tie named-to make a broad
study of the railroad and. transporta
tion proble^i. Since then, bills to this
effect have been Introduced. Senator
Underwood Introduced one of them and
Senator Robinson has Introduced one.
Moreover, Chairman A dam son, of the
house Interstate commerce committee,
has introduced a bill to enlarge the
interstate commerce commission and
the commission itself has recommended
that it be enlarged.
It- is a. practical certainty that if
the attempt is seriously made to pass
either the bill to enlarge the commis
sion or the bill for a commission to
inquire Into the railroad problem,
thete will be an outbreak of bitter
criticism of the present administra
tion of the Interstate commerce laws.
Either of the bills referred to will
meet Tlolent opposition.
Passenger Fares Are -Boosted.
In the last several days, western pas
senger fares have been raised and in
the eastern livestock rate case in
creases of freight rates have been al
lowed which affect a great territory,
east and west. These come on the
heels of the other increases.
If the .attempt, is made to enlarge
the coromUaionit will be objected that
the- Wilson administration has ap
pointed men to the commission who
/kri. not In sympathy with the shippers
and the public and who ar« for increas
ing rates and/ therefore, that it will
not do to enlarge the commission and
allow still more Such men to be named.
If the bill for an Inquiry into the rail
road problem is pushed^ it will be ob
jected that back of this lies a purpose
to relax government regulation.
Congress Inclined to Act.
'The truth is that there are numer
ous signs that conatreoa, despite ine
fact the administration has sought to
avoid additional Interstate commerce
legislation except of a -limited sort. Is
not far from another period like that
of 1905 when the Hepburn bill was
passed or the session of 1909-10, when
there was Important* new railroad
legislation. Regardless of the Presi
dent's effort to curtain railroad legis
lation, there is a growing disposition
to enact legislation of a sort which
will tend to. more stringent regulation.
In this connection there is a decided
sentiment for legislation for govern
ment control of railroad securities.
JOIN THE "ANTI-AIN'T CLUB."
.vKansaa Introduces New Society to lm
5 provf English Language.
Kansas. Which produced "Sockless
Jerry^ Sltnpscn, Carrie Nation, and
WllllawpJlen #h|te to lead the na
tion Into truer channels of life, has now
evolved a society which will fight for
the purity of the English language, as
I its long-wtiiskered citizens once fought
for the purity of the home on the pro
hibition ticket. Kansas has given birth
to the Antl-Ain't Association, & society
whose object Is admirably set forth in
Its alliterative title, and promises to
daxsle the world with Kansan culture,
as manifested by opposition to Amer
ica's greatest grammatical error, an
error whiah custom and lone usage
have almost. Justified Into correctness.
There agi&erhaps not a hundred men
and wcipte in Iowa-who have not at
some time been guilty of using "ain't"
when they eonld /have said "Isn't" or
"scent" The number of Americans
who dally use Valn't" with reckless dis
regard to ths shatterlng of conven
tions and pood English, would foil not
short of hundred million, while those
whose reepect for language leads them
to forbear such an abhorrent practice
w'll be found chiefly In those seats of
learning which have become famous
for their rectitude of conversation thru,
good fortune In being the birthplace
of master poets and essayists.
It Is no^sasier to say "alnt" than to
say "isn:t" or "«rw»T or the ether cor
rect forms.for which "ain't" Is :so fre
quently sulptttuted. Good diction, like
good mannana, is a matter of custom
and of practice and one who lets him-,

finds himself slackly committing er

chlld to say "ain't" is to do irremediable
harm, for. in direct proportion, the

Signifies Intention -to "Live Down"
Past—Favors Large Navy.
"Uncle Joe" Cannon, ex-speaker of
the house, is going, to Washington
n«xt week carrying with him'the most
important mission since he first went
there as a representative forty odd
years ago. The Danville sage intends
to live down "a reputation for Wicked
ness," whioh'be^feela bas been Unjustly
thrust upon him. He said so yesterday
In an Interview at-the Union League
club.
And throughout the talk he main
tained a consistency of decorum In
choice of phrase and gesture that spoke
well for the success of his riilssion.
Even the once' ublqultlous stogie had
been replace^ with a black, fat cigar
of almost uQchewable proportions.
Danger in Mexico.
The former speaker said he is not
at all concerned over the possibility of
the United States being drawn into the
European conflict. He said he has more
concern for possibilities of danger ih
the Mexican situation.
"1 didn't vote for Mr. Wilson In 1912,
and I won't vote for him in 1916," he
said, "but I won't criticise his attitude
in the European matter. It la not a
tl/ne for partisanship. It is a time tot'
everyone to support the pr^identVof
the United States."
"What do you think of the adminis
tration's preparedness program?" he
was asked." He forgot himself a mo
ment and violently waved his left fist
perilously near the questioner's nose.
He showed his old control, tho, and
dropped it harmlessly to the question
er's knee Then he said:
"I don't care to discuss Garrison's
army plans. I don't care to mention
Daniel's navy plans. I do care to say,
however"—and the left arm began to
wave again—"that we must have an
efficient navy of sufficient size and a
standing army of proportions that will
be insurance against war and assur
ance to our'people that we will be safe
in all events."
The Marriage of the Unfit.
The ill wed beget the ill bred. Tour
child has the undeniable right to be
well born. If you marry a person who
is fit to become the parent -of that
child, you nufrry well. If you marry
one Who is unfit to become his parent,
you Wed badly. To marry any person
related to you by blood save in a very
remote degree, to marry anyone who
has a transmissible disease or a hered
itary tendency toward disease is to
jeopardize the well-being of your child.
There facts have been known for
centuries, but never have they been in
sisted upon as in this day of the new
social conscience. A few decades ago
there were many states in the union
that permitted the marriage of uncle
and niece. In every state save Rhode
Island such marriages are now forbid-
