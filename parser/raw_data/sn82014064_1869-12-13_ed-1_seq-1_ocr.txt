Special Despatch to The Chicago Tribune.
Springfield, Dec. 12,
The delegates bare sow all arrived, with the ex- i
ception of Wheaton and Sherrill, on the part of
iLe Republicans, and WasUbome, Neece, Bow*
man, Ball, Wilson, Wendllng, and Rice, on the
part of the Democrat a The former are expected
to-morrow morning, while the latter will come up
on the late train to-night.
The weather anil coniinnesjfitormv, which op* i
crates unfavorably on ratiroaaa, as well as all 1
kinds of travelling. The day ocrorc the battle is
always the one which createe the greatest excite
menu This Is especially the case nere at present,
as affairs are becoming more atd more meddled.
My last despatch left Mr. Uedill in consultation
with a committee of Republican delegates, and
then undecided whether he snonld accept the
nomination tendered him. At a very late hour
this consultation broke up. and Mr. Medlli in
formed the committee Hut he could not give a
decided answer antll this afternoon. Since then he
has welched the whole matter, and, alter advis
ing with the Cock County delegation, has come to
the conclusion that, he cannot eccept the office
proposed without detriment, both to himself and
the convention, mainly on account of his delect
in hearing, lie says this would occasion a dally
annoyance, both to himself and to the members; 1
that he cas no taste, ambition, or snedel quslOca
tlons lor the place proposed; that there
arc many other members properly qualified
for the Presidency, vuimg, if not anxious,
to accrpt lu and that It la the
duty of the convection to select a presiding officer
from among them. Hence in* peremptory rejec
tion of the proffered honor. Of course this opens
the whole question again, solar as the Republi
cans are concerted. Whether they a 111 take op
Church, of McHenry, or Milton Hav, of Sanga
mon, or somebody els* 1 , docs not appear. All this
will have to be raised over and decided upon In
the Republican caucus to morrow morclng.
The Democrat* have b*-en verv active to-day. The
larger portion or the Southern members have
arrived, and and with them a vast host of toe old
Democratic polmclarg cf that part of tre state,
o. 11. LrorcniDg, of Quincy, came in last Light ou
the late train, before the members of the party
had had much time to coxier together, aud in
view of the fact teauhe Republicans had made
the:r nominations, O. H. Browning was very
sirrnpK talked of as the Democratic nomtcee for
the Presidency of the convention; but to-day
the Democrats have been boldxg lit
tle private caucnwe*, and working with
energy and dettra-laaiion to stcure the presid
ing officer of the convection for themselves, or
ferthe Independent*. They claim that they can
do this by putting la nomination some Inde
pendent who will notbeorjt C'ionablc to the Coot
County delegation. Toad.encethrs end, Crown
lug was dropped, and Hitchcock, of Cock, taken
up. and bis claims s'roogly passed. This sew
movement bus created not to much excite
ment as confusion, as 1: would necessi
tate a complete change iu the 6'a‘es that
have already beea made. Everybody
seams to be more or less cgitaiea ard Carried. A
part of the programme store alluded to was that
the Independents should ca.la mceUcghiid put
Hitchcock in nominal on, when he would be sup
ported by the Democrat'. Ai tbit movement de
veloped Itself very sTorgiy towards evening, there
wasmnchepecal&'-ioaaato its success. Many of
ttoic whose lames have been heretofore
r«vor*My mentioned with regard to minor
positions In the convention, in various
capactfes, looked eztr-m'ly downcast*
There was a great marshalling of the clans, and
the parlors and corridors cf the Leiaad House
w*re crowded with people cf all ctscrlpuoua.
There were ex-Gorercpsa host* of local poll
nemos, and a large muster r-f dePgatei-?lect to
the present convention. These ciscuwed the
situation until a iatc hour in the eveemg, and
huttcn-toled every avaLatle member far the pur
pose of learning taelit«»t intelligence. The Bo
publican members, osageperaltainr. were very
slent, and watched the course that affairs were
taking wtth extreme aolicUnde. Tfe Democrats
appeared JobUant and lu the be t cf spirits.
FmaTyitwas anuoouced that the Icdependeu’s
wocld hold a meeting, at which the Democratic
Advisor? Committee weald be present. The-
Chairman of this committee w«s L G. Rosa of
Fulton County. The Indepeadcn's assembled to
thetnmber of eleven, and were as follows:
Messrs. Cooloaugb, Bayes, Cameron. Hitch
cock, Anthocv, Cady. Cra'g, Kirkpatrick,
Dement, Turner, and Fnyder. After a
short consultation, Mr. Anthony put to oom*na
tlon Mr. Hitchcock. There being no objections,
bis selection was msde unanimous. The meeting
ttco proceeded to Qz cp a slate of its own. it
gave a Democratic Secretary, a RepunU'an As
sistant Secretary, and a Democratic Second as
ci-tast Secretary. The Sergeant-at An* was
given to the Republicans. Toe above develop
ment has canted a great sensation.

The amount of wood in the building furnished
fuel for the great fire. The engiaes could do no
more than prevent the Are from spreading

The following is the address issued by the
friends of ODonovan Rosea to the electors of
Tipperary:
‘‘Men of Tipperary—Gallantly and nobly hare
jou espoused the cause of your suffering breth
ren. Weil and truly do yon Interpret the feel
ings that swell to burning the mil heart or Ire'asd
mourning for her cruelly tortured children. Most
heartily do we approve of your choice. Unto
death, aud in sufferings far worse than
tha most diesdful death have those noble
hearted men proved their nnselOsh lore of
Motherland. What tongne can tell, what
words describe the mental tortures that have un
seated reason from her throne 7 Woat the phys
ical sufferings from which so many victims have
found refuge In the grave? 'Greater love than
this no man hath, that a man lay down his life
for his friend.' Even more than life have those
men laid down for their country. For we are
assured by one who suffered that he would far
rather meet death than endnre aor one three
months what be suffered In prison! What love,
then, does not Ireland owe them In return ?
Nor has she been unmindful of them, bur,
humbling herself in the dost, the petition of the
nation lor their release, containing 359,000 names,
was laid at the feet of the Queen. Her hnmh'.e
petition wav spurned with contempt. For mouths
the cation mourned in silence. Again she aroused
herself to another effort on behalf of her suffering
sons, and at the amnesty meetings the full heart
of the country sent up to Heaven the cry of Ireland
mourning for her children because they are not.
Aud once again the prayer of Ireland meets oalv
the heartless denial of the English Minister and
the threats and scoff* of the English press. And
now, ere she folds her hands in solemn and digni
fied silence, leaving the cause of outrage human
ity to God and the civlUied world, Ireland, by the
voice of noble, gallant Tipperary, places on re
cord her protest against the treatment of political
prisoners, and proclaims to the world that
the English Minister’s cruel refusal to release
them from their tortures has intensified her love
for them, and that their names shall henceforth
be enshnned In the hearts of their countrymen,
and become the watchword and the rallying cry
to which the nation shad be roused to action. In
the name of God and onr suffering countrymen—
In the name of humanity and of Ireland—we call
upon you, men of Tipperary, to prove yoarselvea
equal to the proud position the voice of Ireland
B‘slgas to you by electing ODonovan Rossa as the
most fitting person to represent you. God save
-Irelandl”

-TUnoritp Report on tbe Decline of
Amcricun Commerce.
To the Uunorablt the Chamber of Commerce of St
York:
Gentlemen: The undersigned, being a minority
of the ctmmiuee appointed by your President
upon " The Decline of American Comm-rce aud
Us Remedy,” teg leave to submit a* follows:
t\e snail dwell very briefly upon tbe cau'ea
leading to tbe decline of our commerce, aua will
enumerate them as bemg, sucsiautuLiy, as
»t. The superiority of Iron over wood; iron
hzvtcg become so popular in Eng.and fur
drying valuable cargoes that in ports where
these trips are offered wooden veeseis cannot ob
tc;B freights in competition with them.
Next, the rapid increase ol ireight-carrying
steamers built m England—vessels tbat carry large
cargoes acu sail econorn’cally.
Ihe rapid increase of the»e ships hts become a
fee? very alarming to owners of sailing vessels.
Wo have rot rally realized the ebaege, but hs*e
i*cn looktrg forward to the time when our South
rn couon crop should attain its former diruen.
sloes, when we anticipaied a revival cf oar bud
re*s. Ovrexpfctail-jLs in regard to tbe crop of
roticn bare t*fn this vear realized, bn: not to our
Lcp< s for sailing ves.els.
oar coast trade has also gone almost entirely
tuto ttc Lands of steam vessels. Where formerly
a large fleet ot brigs and iiarkafouud employment,
ecarctly any now are required.
Tee Atlatile Oeeaa trams between the United
6'attt and Earopcan nations has gote almost en
ilrelyistoibehai.ua of foreign 6tetm»mpf*,-»Uich
h'.ve made that htgavay a vas: railruad trocz,uver
which Ibey ply with railroad spce«i, and doing’.he
traffic »o cheaply that dtiriag much of ne year
they carry aercrsudise more czeaply than aatluig
ttipa ever could carry it.
Ajaln, during the past twenty years we hvvc
had acoDvtanuy increasing trade around u*pe
Horn to Francisco; bnt the recent completion
of the Pacific Railroad eeex* ta admonish n* That
that trade is soon to dwindle to much saaffer
proportions, as many isrge markets, hith
erto supplied by San Franclroo are cow
bettg supplied by Chicago and Sl Louie. The
Utcst b ow given to tolling ships is the opening
ol the Suez Canal. This route is emlccn’iy Billa
ble for steamthp.*, for here they cm find coal de-
rots, flop and land tasiecgers and freight, end
do all tee basinets that Da? heretofore found
ua way around the Cape or Good H>p&—a much
lets tonnage doing the tame busiccts.
Lastly, American snipping since ibe treating
cut of tbe war has had to bear many more burdens
than before, each as high-priced labor, govern
ment taxes, and tbe increased cos: ot all the sap
plies necessary tora vessel's outfit.
However, it will be useless loeger to detain the
chamber with a recital of causes.
It has undoubtedly long been evident to the
minds of all that tne patient is tick, very sick, and
■ the viral question is me question of remedy.
Upon tcii point, u mil be seen, your committee
fail to agree entirely, aod this Is accordingly pre
sented to you as the minority report.
Ibe first suggestion Is our plan for restoring onr
commerce to its original proportions U embodied
:n the doctrine of “free snips.”
Knowing the prejudice existing in tbe minds of
some against tbe admission of tbe snips of other
cations to the protcctioa of onr flag, we desire to
give in detail tbe reasons for the laitb tba: islaua
upon this point.
We presume It Is unquestionably held that this
country should continue to be a commercial one,
and continue to own ships. It Is also unquestiona-
ble that Great Britain to-day with her iron vessels
bolds entirely tbe trade of many porticos of toe
worV Letup, therefore, go back and consider
the question in the light of tbe experience of that
com try dnrlug tbe past twenty rears.
We know that when she passed her Free Naviga
tion law she did it at a time when we had already
reached and passed her in our mercantile mariae.
We controlled all the trade between New York
aid Liverpool, and lonr-Cftha of tbe whole foreign
trade from our other ports. Our ships commanded
higher raica of freight than those of any other
nation. Our tailing ships were the finest that
sailed the ocean, and their sail* whitened every
sea. This was In 1513.
If any one will take the trouble to read for him
self the debates in Parliament and among the
people in regard to the Free Navigation act then
passe?, it wilt be seen that EcgUsi statesmen of
nose days believed that commerce to flourish
most be free. And has not the experience of
twenty years folly proven their sagacity ?
When that act was passed, we were virtually
masters cl the carrying trade, which we had taken
pcB«ouIon oi through supertorabTityaod superior
flineea for bonding, sailing, and owning eh’ps.
Yet Great Britain had then, os now, her cheap
labor ltd cheap material, besides an immense co
lonial traffic wh'cn »bc «u«o threw open at that
time. Tel how little these advantages seemed to
have availed previous to tbe pusage of this act.
After 1849, for a time, oar commerce flourished
teyoed precedent, aided by tbe Crimean war, by
guano room Pern and icabo, by the Californian
and Australian trade, and by the ever-increasing
cotton crop.
After ism the shipping interest eontinnee to be
less and less remunerative; when tbe war broke
out the decline was of conne much more marked,
uatU, by transfers to other flags, piracy, and other
causes, we reached onr present state.
All this time the ocean steamers of England
have been increasing, and during this tune iron
for shipbuilding purposes has been growing into
favor. Iron ships with iron masts, iron yards,
and iron nggiog are the order of the day, and tbe
conviction is forced upon ns that iron is to take
the place of wood, ana steamers of sailing ves
sels. __
Seeing the benefit derived by Great Britain from
her free navigation iswa, the question naturally
arises, might not the United Slates desire similar
advantage from free trade in ships ? It seems to
ns very clear that such would be the case. Oar
flag would, tinder such a law, be the most popular
on the globe; we should te placed on an equal
rooting as to Hist cost; we should have the mar*
keisof the world In which to select tools to wort
with, and If oar bonders could not give us (with
snch aid as U ts also proposed by your committee
to furnish them) ships at as low a price as any can
be built abroad, we could procure them elsewhere.
We would then enter the field with every ad
vantage formerly possessed br us, and no one can
reasonably doubt that the American flag would
toon be at least aa frequently seen in the porta of
of the world as that of England.
The shlp-bnilding Interest baa always thus far
opposed in* doctrine of free ships, claiming that
it would by each a policy be rained. Now we flad
that gtaas seems literally to be growing In moat
shipyards of our land, and from the testimony of a
gentleman eminent in the business of manufac
turing steam engines and everything in Iran con
nected with ships, we learn that that branch of the
business la also rapidly going to rain. It seems,
therefore, that some policy of a different nature
from that which boa been pursued la necessary.
Your committee therefore propose that a draw
bach of the amount of the daty paid upon all ma
terials entering into the construction or vessels
built shall be allowed to the builder by the gov
ernment, or, as better preventive of fraud, that
this amount be allowed in tne form of bounty
upon every ton of shipping built under certain
necessary regulations. .
This plan places the American ship-builder upon
a par with ms competitor in any country, and It is
our belief that while achieving and maintaining a
supremacy upon the seas of tne world for the flag
or the United States, that Bag need be borne by
forclgn-bnllt vessels bot for a very few years.
It ts further proposed to petition Congress for a
change In the bonded warehouse system to allow
vessels stores to be taken from bond, thoa saving
the vessel the daty.
At ope of your committee, I had hoped that the
question of subsidies might be left to take care of
iTseif, feeling that no good to the general interest
would come from that source, but as it appears to
be regarded by one of the committee as of great
importance, and by the other ss of paramount im
pel can ce, it became necessary to cons! ler Its bear
ing upon the question of the revival of American
commerce. As one, I take the ground that, what
ever Congress does in the way of bounties, subsid
ies, or drawbacks, most be done In the Interest of
every citizen interested in navigation: the encour
agement most be made to operate with the same
equality as the fisheries bounty.
Allusion is frequently made to the great encour
agement given to our railroad lines oy subsidies,as
m the case of the Pacific Railroads. 1 thick that
the people and the government have abundant
reason alread to be justly alarmed at tne great and
dangerous Influence of the enormousionnopol'es
already existing without desiring to add to their
such influences and we shall then be
subsidising with a vengeauca- •- - -
Is no consideration to be given to the large In
vestment which we now have in ship property?
Are we to sacrifice the Interest of all small ship
owners to a few vnonster monopolies t An all
young men, full of enterprise and ambition, to be
told that u they now wuh any participation in
American commercial interests they must seek tt
by besieging the halls of congrem, supplicating
every member fora subsidy, and'diving to the
depthaof and bribery to accomplish
their objects t ~ .
When the future of our oomneree depends on
■oeh measures, how delighted shall we be with
oar progress I ■
Me, fntidsnt,ldeoQtblftsubject « ratt'tß*
portsnee, and, if l dare to trespass oa your time,
would gladly go into details wUcb, m my judg
ment, should, u properlr presented, convince us
e ail of the argent necessity for the utmost freedom
Is this Lranch of American enterprise. 1
If Great Britain’s subsidies have la anyway
aided in developing tbe uses of eteisx or low
v proved her marine architecture, have her sub*:
jeqts sained one point of which we may not reap
the-suvantage without the same costly process
repca cd ? Our plan surely secures this.
In corctaslou, 1 earnestly bone, sir, that If the-
Chamber of Commerce of New Yore commit
useii toany policy on this subject. It shall be m
fsver 01 those great principles which are life gly.
mg In their effect*; which ate upon the side of
cqn&i Justice to all. If bounties or subsidies are
to be ursyed for. let ns pray tbat they be made
upon all who wish to engage tnsnip*
If tins branch of trade needs encouragement,
let the lowering care reach toe humble enterpris
ing poor o an. Too will then march la the right
direction, and win then cause the great stream to
iwea from a thoosaoU sources.
I low teg leave. Hr. President, to offer the fol*
lowitg resolutions as embodying the principles
which I have endeavored t) lay down:
, AVouenf, That the Chamber of Commerce of

parsed by Corcre*s as wifi permit American mer
chanis to purchase foreign built veszcls and place
them under tbe American flag.
notched. That we recommend the passage of

sncciflod Lumber of duiiarsper ton shad be paid

Or if it irsy la the Judgment of Congress be
eately done, that in lieu of the above, a draw
back shall be graced to ship-baUders of each

all material entering Into the construction of

Jtttolced, That we also recommend such change
In our bonded warehouse system as will eoaoie
our ships, traoibg on foreign voyage, to take
their stores out of bond, thereby receiving the
benefit ol the drawback.

Committee of Ways and Means—be la a man of
great wealth and wide influence, although prev
ious to tbe election of President Grant he baa not
figured verv pron inertly lo public affaire, and was
conficqarntiy cot kto»n to tbe comitrv at large.
Prevalent Grans it Is said, formed hi? acquaintance
while be was a car.ct at West Point, and last
rprlcg Mr. McKernan'a rame was frequently
mentioned for a position in the Cabinet.
The nominee lor tbe Fourth Circuit is George 1
A. Pesne, of Maryland. He u a resident or Cum
berland Comity, in that State, and ’» favorably
known to the legal profession as a lawyer of muon
ability. Be baa twice served in the Legislature 0 f
Maryland, and has several times refused nomtna
uotw for tbe House of Representatives. In 1651
Judge Pearre waa one or the first and boldest to
denounce secession. In 1363 tne Unionists of tbe
counties of Frederick, Alleghany, and Washington
elected him Chief Justice ot their Judicial Circuit,
m which position he served till tbe rebel resurrec
tion of 1566, when a change In the constitution
rendered a new election necessary. Judge Peirre
was again the unanimous nomieec-or au narty
for Judge, and, although the Unionists were de
feated laxgclv in the district, only lost his election
by a few hundred votes.
General William B. Woods la a native or New
ark, Ohio, ard bpiorc tbe war was a conspicuous
lawyer in his district. He was a leading Demo
cm*, was earlv elected to the lower brauen ot me
State Legislature, speedily became a leader there
m his parrv, and in 1853-59 was made Speaker of
the Honse'of Representative?, a position In which
his quickness, familiarity with the rales, and fair
nets, enabled him to give great satisfaction. Zn
the next Legislature, that of 1360-61, he was a
leader ot the Democratic mtnorUv, and waa noted
lor tbc virulence of bia opposition to even
one of the early measures or Mr. Lincoln's I
administration; even for a day or two alter tbe I
tiring on Fort Sumter he resisted tbe I
MiUon Loan bill, tbe first measure by which tbe !
Ohio Legislature sought to aid the General Gov-,
eminent tn getting troops in the field. He snbse*
qoentij gave, however, aa the reason for hia re
sistance rttat be only wished to delay action on ill
his party conld, by canons manipulations, be
brooch; to sustain It unanimously. Under his
leaderablp this result was finally accomplished.
On the l&tb ol April he moved tbe passage of the
bid, and signalized this change ot front bv an elo-
3 cent war speech. fie bad no heart, he said, to
ucoas the causes ol the tronblea which were
upon the country. They stood on tbe dread
threshold or civil war, and must ac*. The govern-
UieLt at Washington was his government, and by
It in peace or in war, right or wrong, he would
ever stand. Toe soli of Ohio or of tbe Korth mast
not be invaded. In its defence he would spend
the last farthing of treasure and the lost drop of
blood, ana, locking shields with Its friends, would
s'snd or fall b; tbe country.
Mr. Woods scon after gave proof of the sincerity
of mis change tn bis view* by entering mo aerr-'

Nmtb Circuit, b tbe present Chief Justice of Call
loruu, and u a native ol Jefferson County, la uus
bute. His father and graadiather were among
tbe earliest cf tbe p’onccre, wno, m isoo, settba
tne wilderness in that portion of Northern New
York then known as tbe Black River country, and
le*o accessible at that day than California at tbe
tULo of its w as born and brought
up on a farm till 16 yean of age, attending tbe or
dinary district schools during the winters, and
workngonthe farm during toe summers. At
the age ot lu be attended tora abort time a high
schou; at Watertown, called the Black River In
stitute. The next j ear he removed with hts father
to Pennsylvania, where he asusted in clearing up
a new farm. Bat having, yean belarm-whie ac
cidentally present at an important mil at Water
town, lornxd a determination to adopt the pro
icssioa oflaw, and at the age of 17. relying on bis
own loourcesior support, entered upon a more
thortagn course 01 education, preparatory
to comsenclcg the study of law. The
next eight years were devoted to Hu
trary education and preparation for the
tar, at first in tbe State of New Yerk, and after
ward lu the State ot Ohio. Daring tms period ne
turned the mcirrs fer dciroyiug his expenses by
teacblcg, at first In district schools and afterward
in acaoemles, and as tutor In colleges. la isto be
emigrated to Ohio, and pursued ois studies om at
Western F.etexvo College, and afterward at and
near Columtus. Be oiierwraid removed to Chica
go, where n»s spent a year la the office of tbe late
beuatorJicDougall, or California. Soon alter tula
he entered into a law partnership with the iate
Lieutenant Governor Holmes, at Jefferson, Wb
cousin, where bo was rapioly acquiring a lucra
tive practice ler that rerioo. lu the spring of
isco nc removed to California, going overland
a» one ot tbe tram somewhat noted on tbe plains,
kcown as the the "Badger Traia,”»rnvmgm Call
forma about tbs middle of Joi», after an onpro
ccdentediy short trip of seventy-two days. After
workiLgintheminesof El Dorado County for a
short time, he eLtered upon the practice of law la
Sacramento. Afierwaxd he opened a law office at
Nwaca City. Wtm the exception of a few
months spent in 6su Frauclico, irocn February to
August, ltd, he remained la Nevads city tiff tbe
fail ol lU3. In the fall at ISS3 he retarned to Saa
Freuclkco, stLce which time be baa resided there,
with the exception cf a short absence in Illinois.
In i££SJmige Alexander Campbell resigned his
position as Judge ot the Twelfth Judicial District
of California, whereupon the Governor, by tele
graph, letdered the appointment to the vacancy
10 judge Sawyer. TQ* appointment was accepted.
After holding tte office tome five months, tbe
satisfaction given was such that he was unani
mously elected to tbe position for a fall term of
six years—both parties supporting him. upon
tbe rcorgsulzitioa of Ife courts, Judge
Sawyer was, m ISC3, elected as one of the Jus
tices ef the Soprctao Courr, and upon casting
lots—as required by the coLitl ution, be drew tbe
six years’term. Betas now occoped a Judicial
position iot.c e’ght years, aad daring all that
lime he hes never been ao-tui a: the opening of
councnaaiLgie occasion, and ha* never been
late. As an ladependehi S ate Judge bedlstia
tiLguisbed iUmrelf by overrulmga dectaloi deny
ing Chinamen the right to testify la tbe coarm, oa
tbe ground that It conflicted with the Fourteenth
Amendment.

THE INNOCENT CACsE OF THE WAR
is a public cootracL Tirre is a gent’eman well
kLOftu in this ci.y, whose name la Dodd, tne pro
prietor of Docd e Express. He Bas amassed coo-
feUkrablc wealth, the principal part of which
came into hla poMereion duntg the war. Be is a
caretu acd «cergerc mfn-ano for tbi* reason
waa awarded tbe contract for carrying the mall
matter passing to and from the Po*t Office in this
cut to me various rmUroad depots aad steamboat
and wre*a.tbip istdlugs of the tines engaged in
uan>po:ttrgtbe ma’ls to different pars of the

fine stock of bor-et.
Price Erie proposes to have all tbl* property
thrown overboard, and to start m himself with tbe
at present diminutive Erie Express and do tbe
w ora oi carrying tbe mail*, which U now done ny
Docd.
WKCOWWOIFAWC*.
A messenger wss cent to Mr. Dodd to Inquire on
what terms he would sell out his entire stock if
Pnnce Erie should onst bun. Mr. Dodd replied by
(rtrrg Prince Erie's reconnoitenng party distinct
ly to erderstatd that M it ” had toe alternative of
retiring in good order, sons ceremony, and in
eiamer, or of waiting lor a furious assault m tbe
term oi a toot. Ice reconnoitenng party re*
tcritd to headquarters. Tbe rcconcolrsance bad
only ibe effect ot putting Mr. Dodd on bis guard.
FTBITEGT AKD A FLASK XOTBXZST.
A messenger leu Prince Erie's camp, and went
direct to Washington. Be was tbe bearer of de
spatches to seme one in tbe Postmaster General's
Department. What became of him is uncertain.
Somebody who holds a public position a: ihe capi
tal wrote to Mr. Dodd aaprlslog him of Erie's flank
movement. Then Mr. Dodd sent a friend to Wash
ington, who is supposed to have checkmated tbe
Prince.
HEAVY SEtßXSmxa.
It has been tne custom or the ferry companies
to pass Dodd's mall wagons over free, or to charge
oi,:y a nominal commutation. But Erie, when
Dcdd would do: eell out, struct a direct bloxby
demanding that Dodd tuould pay the highest rate
fer every one of his wagons crossing the Erie ferry.
In consequence of this there was a lovely and live
ly row yesterday at that ferry. It ended in Dodd’s
man having to doaa aU others did—pa; what was
demanded.
BLOOD UT OK DODD'S BIDS.
There waa an lutetee feeling prevailing last
night on tbe part of Mr. Dodd and the attae Aea of
hi» establishment. They were entrenching them
sthts tor stuck along the whole hue. A Hun
reporter having been uformed of this state of af
faire, went Into Mr.TJodd'* camp under a flsg of
truce. He saw General Dodd, and enjoyed on In
terview,
“He can't do the bonnes*,” said tbe General,
sprskicgof Prince Erie. 4 *fle has not got the
etock, nor haahe the experience. I have done tuts
business for yean, and tne regularity with which
1 have the nails carried both ways most be
known to ibe public. .If tney want to change and
give the werk to one who already bos his bands
too foil—who certainly doe* not need it to make
money for himself—that la a different matter. I
