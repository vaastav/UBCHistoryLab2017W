Saturday, December 7, IN8W.
Mr. Whitman on Wool.
There is to be a determined fight
on the part of the free traders in con
gress to place wool on the free list.
Mr. Whitman, from whom we quote
below, is a resident of Boston, treas
urer of the Arlington Mills, the larg
est woolen mills in the country, presi
dent of the Woolen Manufacturers
Association for the United States and
ono of the leading merchants of JJos
ton. 'Chough a manufacturer, he is a
man of broad views and a linn be
liever in fair play. Petitions are be
ing actually circulated in the east
asking congress to abolish the duties
on wool. How long could the fann
ers of western North Dakota, who
are at present taking sueh a deep in
terest in sheep raising, which is to be
the leading industry of this country,
exist if they had to sell their wool
for 8 to 10 cents pound! This
would be the highest price if they
were brought into competition with
Australta and other foreign wool pro
ducing countries. The friends of the
wool growers in congress owe it to
their constituents to crush the ene
mies of protection to the wool raiser
in their iirst attempts to ruin that
industry. "While I will not deny,''
writes Mr. Whitman, "that, if all
other things were equal, lrec raw ma
terial might be an advantage to the
American wool manufacturer. 1 think
it plain that, until all other things
AKE equal, our woolen industry has
most to gain by conceding to the
growers what it claims for itself—
sufficient protection to make compe
tition with other nations possible.''
In speaking of the wool growers of
the country he says "These agricul
tural constituencies control the legis
lation of the United States today, and
will control it more effectually in the
future than in the past. You think
it would be an act of business and
political sagacity for the New Eng
land states to openly antagonize the
great and politically controlling con
stituencies of the West, and by so do
ing to invite the retaliation they
would be sure to attempt. To me it
seems wise to accept the fiscal policy
to wliicfli the government has been
fpr thirty years committed, and to
accommodate our business to that
policy." Mr. Whitman is wise
enough to see the power of the
friends of protection and advises the
New England states to go slow in an
tagonizing the great west. The
friends of the wool growers hold the
key to the situation in congress and
they must keep the door locked
against the free wool advocates.
Every wool grower in this section
should contribute his share towards
fighting the common enemy by writ
ing to congressmen with whom they
may be acquainted and urge them to
stand by the farmers and wool grow
ers.
THE McLean County News is a
tiling of the past. The issue of Nov.
30th announces its suspension.
SENATOR FAUWELL has decided to
introduce a bill in congress for the re
peal of the civil service law. lie
says: "Administration of the affairs
of the government is business and
nothing but business. I coukl not
run my wholesale dry goods store and
make a success of it by pursuing
these methods."
TIIE Minneapolis Tribune hits the
nail square on the head when it says
that few people ever stop to think of
the enormous amount of time, pa
tience and money the newspapers ex
pend upon church fairs, festivals and
the catch-penny doings of all sorts of
societies. It is not ungracious to say
that in a majority of cases the thing
is so taken for granted that even
thanks are deemed superfluous. The
newspaper is supposed to be every
body's bulletin board, and the news
paper men everybody's servants.
IN reading over the Kowe prohibl
tion bill we failed to discover any
point that could be made stronger,
but there are several points that
should be amended, among them that
portion requiring the proprietor of a
drug store to V-e a registered pharina
cist. There are many druggists in
North Dakota who are not pharma
cists, but employ a registered phar
macist for clerk and the law would
shut all such out. The provisions
that all prosecutions and other mat
ters shall come before the county
judge makes the law practically
dead letter for at least a year as we
are to elect our first county judges in
the fall of 1890. The law seems to
be drawn in such shape that the old
blue laws of Connecticut are as notli
ing compared to it, however, as pro
hibition is in the constitution it
Should be supported by a stringent
law and the people will then soon de
cide the question: Is prohibition a
failure?

President Harrison's First Com
munication a Very Compre
hensive Document.
Reduction of Surplus by a Low
er Tariff Needfid—Indian
Policy Approved.
Congressional Control of Elections—
territorial Government for Okla
homa—Civil Service Reform.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.—The president's
message was read at the joint session of
house and senate. The document con
tained over 14,000 words and its reading
occupied an hour and fifteen minutes.
Good will and cordiality, Mr. Harrison
says, characterizes our relations with
all foreign countries. The international
convention, now in session at Washing
ton. affords opportunities of still further
extending relations with South Ameri
can states, and congress is asked to give
its co-operation in furthering such a re
sult. The maritime conference is also
expected to bring the United States into
closer relations with European countries.
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.
In regard to diplomatic relations the
president recommends that our repre
sentatives in South America be advanced
to a rank corresponding to that of the
representatives from those countries.
The failure of the negotiation of a Chi
nese treaty has left questions open which
congress should settle, especially the ex
clusion of labor immigration. Samoan
affairs are in a satisfactory state. Ques
tions between the United States and
Great Britain are in an encouraging way
to adjustment. The fisheries dispute
with Canada has been during the past
year marked by temperate action on both
sides. Questions regarding citizenship
of foreign born subjects naturalized in
America, continue to arise, notably in
France, Italy, Russia and Turkey.
Special conventions to settle for
ever all such difficulties are recom
mended. Water boundary between the
United States and Canada should be
definitely fixed. Extraditable offense
list should be enlarged.
THK BRAZILIAN REVOLUTION.
The recent revolt in Brazil has not
interrupted friendly relations with that
country. Our minister there lias been
instructed to fully recognize the republic
when a majority of the citizens have
voted for such a form of government.
ltKOAHDINU THE SURPLUS.
Report of the secretary of the treasury
shows receipts for liSS'.l exceed expendi
tures S57.4i0.12U.i5!l, for current year
§48,6•'»,983.01, for 1891, estimated, sl !,
509,622.80. Existence of so large an
actual and anticipated surplus should
have immediate attention of congress, to
reduce receipts of government to the ex
penditures. During bonds at premium
is a questionalile expedient, but one
which is the only resort under present
conditions. Placing government funds
in national banks without interest is a
dangerous expedient for getting the
money in circulation and should be im
mediately Mopped.
LOWER PROTECTIVE TARIFF.
Revision of the tariff law is recom
mended. The irregularities of the law
should be adjusted but the protective
principle should be retained and applied
to farm products as well as manufao
turns. Tlie free list can safely be ex
tended by removal of internal revenue
tax on tobacco, and, if safeguards
against fraud can be secured, the re
moval of the tax on spirits used in the
arts would be desirable.
SILVER COINAGE.
The net increase of money in circula
tion in the last decade has been 5890,824,
10!). The total coinage of silver dollars
Nov. 1. 1889, was $348,038,001, of which
$283,539,521 are in the treasury vaults.
Silver certificates for 8227,319,014 of the
amount in vault are outstanding. No sec-,
retary of the treasury has deemed it ex
pedient to increase the monthly purchase
of bullion from thf! 82,000,000 directed by
law to the
$4,000,000
allowable. The
value of bullion used in a silver dollar
has fallen in the past ten years from 93
cents to 72 cents. If silver is to be used
as a monetary medium the relative value
of gold and silver bullion must be ex
pected to hi1 taken into consideration in
commercial transactions. Such a result
would be discreditable to our financial
management and business interests. We
should not tread on such dangerous
ground.
COAST DEFENSE.
We are practically without cQast de
fense. Our forts and other structures,
while good enough for the arms of the
day in which they were made, would be
worse than no protection for the modern
guns now under construction for harbor
use. An appropriation for new works
at the most important points should be
made at once.
RIVERS AND HARDORS.
Improvement of our important rivers
and harbors should not be allowed to
cease. A more systematic plan should
be adopted and the work pushed more
rapidly.
OUR COURTS.
The need of better protection for jur
ists is shown in the Terry shooting case.
Business of the supreme courts would
be expedited by the establishment of
an appellate court having final jurisdic
tion in certain classes of cases. The su
preme court recommends this.
TRUSTS.
Congress should take such action as
they find they can to crush out monopolies
commonly called trusts. The enactment
of a national bankrupt law would be de
sirable. Naturalization laws should be
revised. No emigrant should be given
citizenship who is an enemy of social
order or who has taken oaths at variance
with our laws.
l'OSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT.
Suggestions of the postmaster general
are approved, especially the plan of di
viding the service into districts that
shall include include instructions and
suggestions, and a rating of efficiency of
postmasters.
THE NAVY.
The report of the secretary of the navy
shows rapid improvement but no in
crease in the number of naval vessels as
the same number have been condemned
or lost as have been added. The country
needs more cruisers and congress should
make appropriations for them.
INDIAN QUESTION.
Substantial progress has been made In
Indian education and in allotment of
lands. Such a course Is an incentive to
thrift and is contributing to setting the
problem of what shall be done with the
red man. Negotiations fot opening a
portion of the bioux reservation and the
allotment in severalty of the remainder
have been successful. Its ratification by
congress is asked. The work of the
Cherokee commission has not yet
reached a conclusion.
OKLAHOMA AND ALASKA.
Oklahoma has now a population of
60,000. The City of Ghthrie has 8,000.
Oklahoma City 5,000. There are several
other important cities and towns. These
have no government but martial law.
Congress should create a territorial gov
eminent.
Provisions eljiould be made for acquisi
tion of titles to real estate in Alaska.
Land laws should be extended to that
section and the power given to levy
taxes. An appropriation for education
should bo made. The population is so
badly scattered as to offer serioux obsta
cles to territorial government. The or
ganization of several sub-districts with
municipal councils .would be safe and
useful.
PENSIONS,
$Iany veterans who enured the hard
ships and arduous duties uf our most
bloody campaigns are now disabled from
diseases which had a real, though not
traceable, origin in the service. Tho
pension roll is already large, but this
should not deter the government from
giving such veterans full justice. There
lire irregularities in the present law
which should be remedied, but not in
the line of reduction.
SIGNAL SERVICE AND WORLD'S
KAIU.
The signal service should be taken
from the war department and made a
bureau in the agricultural department.
Such legislation as is necessary is recom
mended for the opening of a world's
fair in some one of our cities to com
memorate the 400th anniversary of Co
lumbus' landing.
LAND LAWS.
The policy which has been in forco in
land department has worked big damage
to settlers. This has been greatly
changed by this administration. The
land laws should be interpreted as fa
vorably as possible for the settlers, but
safeguards should be erected to prevent
the acquiring of large tracts of timber or
other lands by individuals or companies
through frauds. When discovered such
frauds should be punished to the full ex
tent of the law.
CIVIL SERVICE.
Tho civil service commission force is
inadequate and should be enlarged.
Heretofore the book of eligibles in the
various departments has been' closed to
the public. This has caused charges of
fraud. The books have been opened to
the public. The purpose of the civil ser
vice law was to exclude political consid
erations in connection with appoint
ments. Some recent congressional
investigations haro shaken public faith
in its efficacy. Reform of civil service
will make no progresstill the law and its
enforcement are well established. If
some of its provisions have been fraudu
lently evaded our resentment should not
suggest a repeal of the law, but its re
form.
EDUCATION.
Grants for education have heretofore
been in lands. The time has come when
this resource is nearly exhausted. Ap
propriations in cash are for the future
recommended.
THK NEGRO PROBLEM.
The colored people did not intrude
themselves upon us. They were brought
here and held for years in chains. Hap
pily for both races, they are now free.
Since emancipation they have made
great progress education and aequisi
sition of property. They have gained
honor and respect on the battlefield and
in the shop and farm. But, notwith
standing tills, in parts of the country
where the colored population is large,
they are yet deprived of their rights, po
litical and civil. This wrong effects not
only their own community but every
part of the nation. It is a shame
on our civilization that this is so,
and this generation should courageously
face these grave questions and work
their solution. The power of congress
to take the whole direction and control
of congressional elections is clearly de
fined. The present law for a partial
supervision of such elections should be
strengthened and extended by taking all
the processes of such elections under
federal control.
MERCHANT MARINE.
Subsidies should be granted for the es
tablishment of lines of commercial
steamers, notably to South aud Central
America, Mexico, China, Japan and
Australia. Provisions could also well be
made for a naval reserve of such vessels
in our merchant marine as were fitted
for war use.
These and such other measures as the
peace and honor of our country suggest
are recommended to the serious consid
eration of this congress.
FIFTY-FIRST CONGRESS.
Some of tho Matters Which Will be Con
sidered at This Session.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.—There are
many questions to be considered by
this congress which cannot bo settled on
party lines. The principal topics to come
before it for discussion are the tariff-, the
silver question, federal control of na
tional elections, a proposition to repoal
the civil service law and the appropria
tion of money for rivers and harbors and
other local objects and enterprises. The
tariff question was the chief issue In the
last congress. It will divide interest this
term with
The Silver Question.
The question of silver coinage has been
much agitated of late mouths and
Mr. Leech, the director of the
mint, lias expressed the belief that con
gress will increase the coinago of silver.
The only doubt that exists is whether
the extremists in both houses of con
gress will not prevent legislation by re
fusing to accede to any proposition for
moderate legislation.
Tariir and Internal Revenue.
Two correlative questions wljich agi
tated the last cpngresa will come up be
fore the Fifty-first congress for a great
deal of discussion. An effort will be
made to amend the tariff laws and a
strong inlluence will be brought to bear
to have the internal revenue laws re
pealed. It is generally understood that
tho Republican majority in the house
and senate will make an effort to have a
bill on the line of the Allison tariff bill of
last year put through both houses and
sent to the president. The discussion of
this question may be postponed for sev
eral months. It is bound to absorb a
reat deal of the attention of both
nouses.
Senator Farwell, of Illinois, will intro
duce a bill to
Abolish Civil Scrvlce Kxauiiuatlons.
He has discussed the matter with the
president and told him what he proposes
to do. He denounces the law as a me
nace to good government. Representa
tive Chandler, of Georgia, will alsp in
troduce a bill to repeal the civil service
law.
The question of the relations betweop
the United States and Canada, and of
tho effect of competition of the Canadian
Pacific railroad and its connections with
the railroads of this country will oome
up for discussion in the senate under the
reports to bo presented by special com
mittees which have been investigating
tho subject during the past summer.
To Orgumie Okluhoma.
Congress will, be asked at an early day
to provide a form of government for
Oklahoma. A bill for this purpose is
now being prepared under the supervis
ion of the secretary of the interior. The
national pension committee of the Grand
Army of the Republic has formulated a
number of pension bills which will be
offered for consideration. Principal
among these is the per diem allowance
pension bill, and the total disability pen
sion bill.
The World's Fair Location.
One of the early questions to be con
sidered by congress is the location of the
world's fair of 1802. The claims of New
York, Washington, St. Louijj and Chi
cago will be warmly prlased in the
beginning of tho session, arid tho ques
tion will likely not be disposed of until
January or Fobruary.
WHERE IS PARNELLT
The Great Irish Patriot lias Mot ISoen
Seen for Several Wet&s.
LONDON, Dec. 8.—the St, James Ga
zette says that Mr, Parnell disappeared
soveral weeks ago. and since then he had
not been heard from. His whereabouts
is a mystery and his prolonged abseu^e
causes much trouble to his adherents.
The Gasette says that though it has been
Mr. Parnetl's custom occasionally to se
clude himself, his period of retirement
lias this time been longer than usual.
He has even failed to keep a number of
important engagements, among which
was one to meet Mr. Gladstone.
World Fiiir Sitr* Favored by Congressmen
NF.W YORK, Dec. 5.—The World prints
the opinions of congressmen interviewed
as to their preference as to the site of the
world's fair in 1892. Chicago is favored
Jjy 07. New York by 47, Washington by

WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—The house of
representatives was called to order one
minute after noon by John B. Clark, the
clerk of the house in the Fiftieth con

women and children. When the doors
were opened not only the galleries, but
the floor of the house, quickly filled with
strangers. A great many of tho new Re
publican members were at hand early.
The election of officers of the house
was delayed by an effort to break the
caucus action on chaplain and substitute
the name of Dr. Milburn the old chap
lain for that of Dr. Ramsdell, the caucus
nominee. A great part of the afternoon
was spent in calling the roll. The house
elected nil the officers chosen by the cau

Milburn, the blind preacher,' was re
elected chaplain.

Six new desks had been placed on the
Republican side of the chamber and five
of them were occupied by the senators

Bills Introduced—The Liquor Question.
BISMARCK, N. D., Dec. 5.—The legis
lature has got down to business and acts
like a working body, with few orators in
either house. In the senate the gover
nor's message by subjects was referred
to proper committees. In the house bills
on railroads, warehouses and hail insur
ance were introduced. Governor Miller
has signed the first law of the new state.
It transfers the duties of insurance com
missioner from the auditor to the insur
ance commissioner. The supreme court
judges prepared a bill that was intro
duced iu the senate that fixes tho
first term, second Tuesday in Jan
uary, at Fargo second term at Bis
marck, first Tuesday in May, and
third term at Grand Forks, first
Tuesday in October. The bill allows the
judges $800 annually for mileage and
office rent. Dr. Belyea, of the senate,
introduced a bill that compels physicians
to take out a license. A bill in the house
compels the railroads to allow the build
ing of elevators on right of way for a
nominal ground rental. The prohibition
bill must pass by a two-thirds vote if it
bccomes operative before July 1. It is
conceded that it cannot pass the senate by
that vote and the liquor men can, there
fore, hold on without license until July,
1890. _____

Tribune Building nt Minneapo
lis Converted Into Death
Trap by the Flames.
Eight Lives Definitely Known
t& Have Been Lost—The List
May Be Much Higher
MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 2.—The eight-story
briok building occupied by The Min
neapolis Tribune, was totally de
stroyed by lire Saturday 'night. The
conflagration was attended by a fearful
loss of life. Shortly after 10 o'clock
smoke was seen issuing from the win
dows at the north end of the third floor.
The upper floors at that time were filled
with reporters, editors and compositors.
On the sixth floors were the editorial
rooms of The Pioneer Press, in which a
number of reporters were at work.
AVhen the smoke became heavy on that
floor Reporter Joseph T. Mannix started
down the stairway to make an investiga
tion. In the extreme north end of the
third floor were two rooms which had
formerly been used by the League of
Republican clubs. These rooms had not
been occupied for about six months, ex
cept as a place to store waste paper. In
this room the lire started presumably
From Spontaneous Combustion.
When the door was broken in the
flames burst out in Mr. Mannix's face,
driving him down the stairway. He
made a desperate attempt to go back to
warn his companions, but the flames
were too fierce, aud he was driven back.
Several men were on the stairway at the
time, and he directed them to turn the
alarm at the corner of Fourth and Nicob
let avenues, For some reason no ono did
so, and there was considerable delay in
getting the alarm to tho fire department,
at least fifteen minutes elapsing. The

and sucked the flames up to the roof,
spreading the fire throilgh the entire
buildtng. When the fire department
arrived the entire building was in flames.
There was only one stairway in the
building, and that was built around the
(•levator shaft. As the fire started at tho
head of the stairway on the third floor,
Every Aveutio of Kucapc
was cut olf, except a single fire escape
on the north side of the windows. The
flames burst out the windows on tlie
third floor, and the frail iron ladder was
red hot before some of the men had a
chance to use it. The Haves ladders
were hurriedly raised by willing hands,
and many of the men were rescued from
the windows.
Tho List of
The list of the dead, so far as known,
is as follows:
MILTON riCKETT, uaaiutant city editor gf
The Pionetjr Vress.
JAMEy F. IOOK, Associated l'resu operator.
KDWAHD OLSON, president of thfc University
of South Dakota, at Vermillion.
JEURY .1ENKINSQN, printer.
KOflEHT McL'UTCHEN, a printer.
W. H. MILLMAN, commercial editor of The
Tribune.
AVALTKR E. MILES, day operator of the As
sociated Press.
Milton Plokctt,
the assistant olty editor of The Pioneer
Press, started with four companions who
escaped but became separated from
them. He went to the fire escape on the
north side of the building aim started
down it. The flames were bursting out
of the third story windows, and the lad
der's rounds were red hot. He clung to
it only for a minute and dropped to the
alley below, dead.
JnnifftF. Igoo,
the Associated Press operator, staid at
his post too long. He sent a message to
his chief in New York: "There is a tire
on the third floor of The Tribuno build
ing, and I'm on the seventh." Then he
"took" the dispatches as they came for a
few moments. His next words over the
wire were: "Hoys, I've got to 'stand
you oil." I'm the only one left on this
floor. Everybody is gone, and I can
stand it any longer and his key clicked
shut for the last time.
Kilwiirtl Oliton,
president of the South Dakota univer
sity, at Vermillion, had gone into the
building to call on a friend to say good
bye, and was preparing to depart" when
the alarm was given. He started to fol
low his friend, Policeman Grevstad, but
became confused, reaching a window in
the rear, from which he fell to the
ground.
W. H. Mlllinan,
commercial
Editor of
The Tribune, did
not go down at the first alarm, but a few
moments lat?r appeared in the Pioneer
Press rooms, overcoat in hand. It was
then too late to go down the stairwav,
and he hurried back into the room above.
He was seen to step out of the window
and grasp the telegraph wires with the
intention of descending it the same win
as did Igoe. He went only a few feet
when he lost hold and shot down like'
a rock to the frozen ground below. He
was killed instantly. It was only about
two weeks ago that Millman's wife was
sulfocatcd by gas escaping from a leak
ing pipe at his home, and Millnian had
only just returned to his post from es
corting the remains to her former home
in the East.
McCutcheoii and Jcnkinson.
Robert McCutcheon and Jerry Jenkin
6on, compositors, fell from the seventh
story and were instantly killed. Mc
Cutcheon was trying to reach a window
sill on the sixth floor when he lost his
balance and fell, striking with fearful
force the very projection which he de
signed to make liis refuge.
Preferred IJullct to Hurtling.
An unknown compositor appeared at a
seventh story window at First avenue
side and looked below. A jump below
was almost certain death, while to re
main and be bumcd was worse, lie
was seen to hesitate a moment, and then
he took a revolver from his pocket,
placed it to his head and tired. He fell
back into the burning building.
The loss on the building and contents
is estimated at $380,000, with about $193,
insurance.
The lnw Not Repealed by the Clause in
tlie Admission Act.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.—Assistant At
torney General Shields, of tho interior
department, has given the secretary of
the interior an opinion as to the effect ot
the 17th section of the act admitting the
new states, which refers to the act of
1841 (the original pre-emption act) and
repeals the same as to the new states. He
holds that taking the whole section to
gether, the intent was not to repeal the
pre-emption laws, but to make a grant
of lauds in lieu of the 8th section of the
act of 1 Si l, generally known as the in
ternal improvement grjtnt, and to repeal
that section as to the new states—that
the act of 1841 was carried into the re
vised statutes and repealed in 1873—that
if congress had intended to repeal the
pre-emption laws it could have done so
by repealing the sections of the revised
statutes appertaining thereto or by apt
words so declaring, and not by a repeal
of the old act of 1841: that the pre-emp
tion laws as contained in the revised
statutes, except as to the internal im
provement grant, are still in forco in the
uew states.
