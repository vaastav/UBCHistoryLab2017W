THE OHIO TAX DUPLICATE
(Columbus Dispatch.)
The Ohio tax duplicate for 1915 Is
aaaoanced by the state tax commls
Jen to be 10,270,313,505, an Increase
C 105,S40,286. The real estate dup
licate has been Increased morethan
BIMjOOO.OOO, while the personal dupli
cate shows a loss from last year of
9X,543,221.
This is the result of the Warnes
Jaw operated bjr its foes. The Itepub-
Ueaa legislature repealed the law, but
eeald not make the new law effective
tin the first of the new year, 191C.
Sewevcr, the assault on the Warnes
law In the campaign and afterwards
gave the tax-dodgers assurance of
aecoor, and doabtless soma of them
hare even now taken advantage of It.
The loss In the personal duplicate is,
la part at least, attributable to that
aa&appy influence. What it will be
ta 1916, when the elective assessors
rmmo their work, and the man who
n dodge the most taxes again be
cones the best fellow can be left to
Ifee Imagination until the figures aro
la.
The message of President Wilson
to congress, which appears In full in
today's Banner Is an exceedingly in
teresting document, dealing with sev
eral Important subjects. There Is one
portion of it that should be read by
every person that relating to the dis
loyalty of some naturalized citizens
of the United States. In the message
the portion referred to is In tho sev
enth column under tho heading, "Na
tion's Secret Foes Should bo Crush
ed." The president points out a con
dition that is moro than alarming and
states that tbero is no law to proper
ly reach and adequately punish the
guilty of their offenses against their
adopted country.

OPENING
Of River And Harbor Congress
In Washington
Washington, Dec. 8 Tho imporve
ment of coast and inland waterways
will be urged, as an Important adjunct
of tho national defense program, at
the National Rivers and Harbors
Congress, which opens here today.
During tho past two years no new
improvements have been provided for
In the appropriations of the govern
ment, and tho budgets drawn up for
these improvements have been howl
ed at as "pork barrels." It Is predict
ed that heavy pressure will be
brought to bear on congress for a big
appropriation for river and harbor
improvements. Tho claims of the
waterway Improvement boosters will
rest mainly on the now Issue of na
tional defense, and tho delegates ar
riving today are hopeful of putting a
big sharo of the defense funds Into
providing better wnter accommoda
tions as an Important phase of pre
paredness. Tho river and harbor Improvement
advocates huvo adopted a now slogan,
"Road, rail and river," and will en
deavor to prove to tho country that
theso three routes of transportation
should bo developed together and
made a interdependent one upon the
other, for safety, economy and effic
iency. Waterways as a means of national
defense will bo the subject of an ad
dress by Congressman J. Hampton
Moore of Pennsylvania, who will lay
stress on tho valuo of Improved ln-
jland waterways as an aid to speedy
mobilization.
Senator Joseph E. Ransdoll of
Louisiana says that the convention
will "voico a ringing protest against
the slanderous ussaults made on wa
terways improvements," referring to
the filibuster led by Senator Burton
of Ohio, which prevented the passage
of the river and harbor appropriation
bills containing specific appropria
tlonstlons for designated projects.
Logan Waller Pago, who was for
somo years president of tho Ameri
can Highway association, is to give
an address on tho relation of good
roads to waterways. Another speak

mnn of tho Mississippi River Commis
sion, on "Tho Utilization of Rivers."

PLAN
Carrying Water Pipe Across
'The Desert
Now York, Dec. 8 That Syria may
be tho battleground betweon tho Ger
mans and Turks against the English
forces protecting Egypt Is tho belief
of members of tho Syrian colony
hero. News has come through dev
ious channels to the Syrians In Amer
ica that great preparations have been
made in their homo country for some
sort of operations. Private advices
received here say that the Turks,
with the assistance of German engi
neers, are pushing a railroad toward
Suez over 150 miles of desert, and are
paralleling it with a water pipe line.
Cable advices from time to time have
referred to such efforts, but the
project was supposed to have been
abandoned when the attack on the
Dardanelles began.
The tracts of sand to bo traversed
correspond to the wilderness In which
the children of Israel wandered, ac
cording to the Old Testament narra
tive. The Turkish government, ac
cording to a well-informed Syrian '
here, is denuding the country In order
to put through military measures.
Tho beauty of-Palestine and of Syria
Is being destroyed, he claims. The
Turks have cut down the olive trees
and other valuable trees, to keep
their railroads supplied with fuel. In
Syria there is no coal to be had and
petroleum 13 very scarce. The finest
woods are going under the locomotive
boilers, say the local Syrians, and the
sacred cedars of Lebanon aro doomed
If not already consumed.
Tho Turks succeeded months ago
In sending troops over the desert
waste, and one company is credited
with having reached the Suez canal.
Tho British aviators kept tho Allies
In touch with their movements, and
the venture was a failure. But in
that attack, tho Turks were unorgan
ized, and they relied upon tho water
which they carried on the backs of
mules. Tho news that comes now,
howovcr, indicates that tho expected
now attempt will bo made with the
precision of German efficiency. The
water mains aro being laid from Bir-es-Seba,
the Bcorsheba of tho Old
Testament, whero there are wells,
and the water is to bo forced by pow
erful pumps.
The pipes aro to be
tapped at Intervals, so that a supply
