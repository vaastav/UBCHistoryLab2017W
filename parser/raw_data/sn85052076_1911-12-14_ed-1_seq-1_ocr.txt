Small Accounts
There are many persons in this county who feel, pos
sibly, that their business does not warrant the
keeping of a bank account, but who would, in real
ity, be greatly benefitted thereby.
This is a mistaken Idea. A bank account is valuable
to every person who transacts business.
You are enabled to keep your money where it is safe
yet it is available in part or whole at any time.
You can pay all bills by check. This gives you a re
ceipt for every dollar paid, for all checks are. re
turned to you after having been paid by your bank.
The fact that you possess a bank account gives you a
better standing among business men and enables
you to establish a credit with your bank when you
have need of it.
We welcomejsmall accounts at this bank..
