SONG OF THE BLIZZARD.
O! blizzard of blizzards am I;
I've come from my home in the sky.
I come night and day,
And I've come now to stay
With the people in town
Anil around.
O! jolly good-natured am I;
I turn somersaults in the sky,
And bluster and blow
And shake flakes of snow
In the faces of men who are tight
My delight.
O! wretchedly cruel am I;
I make folks sicken and die.
I turn loose the snow
Up their pants legs to go
And freeze 'em before they can shout
"Take it out."

Last Wednesday and Thursday
were as beautiful as winter dayR
could be. On Friday night black
clouds marched boldly across the
heavens and gave warning of more
unwelcome comings. At twelve
o'clock snow began to fall and con
tinued all night. Next morning
the citizens were astonished to find
about six inches of snow covering
the ground. As a general thing
when snow falls in this country it
melts as fast as it strikes the earth.
But, unfortunately, the ground was
dry and frozen and each flake there
remained without the loss of one.
All day Saturday the program, as
laid down by Prof. Foster, was
carried out to a letter. Not until
ten o'clock at night did the imwel
comed visitors cease falling. It
was then eighteen inches deep.
Sunday evening at five o'clock a
cold drizzly rain set in, which las
ted for a few minutes. Later in the
evening snow began to fall. We
are not now able to state how fast
it fell or how long it continued. We
want it distinctly understood that
we didn't stand around to see.
But on Monday morning conster
nation filled us when we were com
pelled to waddle through 26 inches
of snow to get to our office. It was
during this trying time that we
conjured the pathetic little poem
which heads this page.
On nearing our destination we
found the old carpenter's shop on
Main street, the property of Elijah
Walker, lying flat on the ground
The Immense weight of the snow
on the roof had sprung the joints
and catastrophe was the result.
Reaching town, we found the rear
end of Harper's ware house hug

The business men were busuy en

tops of their houses.
Estimating the fall of snow at two
feet, the whole amount in the coun
tv would reach the vast sum of
sixty-five billion, eight hundred and

ure the horse returned to the house.
The saddle was displaced, the seat
having been thrown beneath the
horse. On searching for the woman,
she was found lying in the road.
Nothing definite is known as to the
cause, but it is presumed that she
was tnrown irom the animal, or

tire time between her discovery
and death, she spoke not a word.
