COLUMBIA.
Friday Morning, Dec. 8. I860.
The Situation.
All eyes are now turned to the Federal
Capital, where the present and future
interests and destinies of tho country, are
probably, to be determined by thc Con?
gressmen assembled in that city.
Some eleven States, claiming to be States
of tho Union, having returned to their
allegiance after the failure of their strug?
gle; loyal to the Government and frankly
accepting tho results of the late conflict,
they seek once more to be restored as an
integral part of thc family of States which
compose tho American Union.
Tho tidings from Washington, so far as
they have reached us, are unfavorable to
tho hopes of an early admission of tho
Southern members of Congress elect. The
dominant party having in a previous cau?
cus nominated them, have elected Mr.
Colfax Speaker, and McPherson, Clerk of
thc House. Wo learn from the d<* patches
in the Jlerald and other Norther:- papers,
that thc first proceeding of this caucus,
was the appointment of a committee of
seven, consisting of Messrs. Stevens, of
Pennsylvania; Raymond, of Now York;
Spalding, of Ohio; Washburno, of Illinois;
Payne, of Wisconsin; Boutwcll, of Massa?
chusetts, and Blair, of Maine-a radical
committee, from which, already cut and
dried by Thaddens Stevens, a resolution
was presented which at once, for at least
a twelve-month, if adopted by the two
houses, disposes of tho excluded Southern
States. This resolution provides that,
after the organization of tho two houses,
a joint committee, of fifteen more mem?
bers of the House and six of the Senate,
"shall be appointed to inquire into the
condition of the States which formed the
so-called Confederate States of America,
and report whether they, or any of thom,
are entitled to bc represented in either
house of Congrees, with leavo to roport at
any time by bill or otherwise; and until
snch report shah have been made, and
finally acted on by Congress, no member
shall bc received into either house from
any of the so-called Confederate States;
and all papers relating to the representa?
tives from said States shall be referred to
said committeo without debate."
Such is tho avowed programme of the
party who are opposed to the reconstruc?
tion policy of President Johnson. We had
hoped for a different course; we had begun
to believe that the dictates of passion in
tho legislation of the country would be no
longer lollowecl or obeyed, and that a wiso
conservatism, based upon sound principle 3
of statesmanship, would be the guide at
this juncture of our affairs. As policy of
simple justice to tho Southern people, it
would be the means of insuring that firm
allegiance which they have honestly ten?
dered to the Government. "When," as a
cotemporary justly remarks, "it is so easy
to heal the divisions of thc past by a prac?
tical recognition of the rights which all
sections have heretofore conceded to exist,
it would seem that few thinking men at t he
North would be found willing to reject the
claims of the South to representation. Thc
position of President Johnson, in reference
to the various parties in the country, is not
wholly unlike that of Charles II in refer?
ence to tho factions which divided England
at thc time of the restoration. Though
bitterness of feeling had survived in the
hearts of those who had so long opposed
each other during tho civil war. Charles
found that all parties would willingly lend
a united support to one who waa able to
put an end to a continuance of existing
evils. 'Charles came- back,' says Macaulay,
'not as a mediator between a people and a
victorious enemy, but as a mediator be?
tween internal factions.' Such, we think,
is the view which should be taken of our
recent struggle, and thc policy of the coun?
try should bo directed towards a complete
reconciliation of the past, by tho admis?
sion of all sections to the enjoyment, as in
former times, of equal rights, under the
('oust?tntion.'* This, for some time past
has been the object of all tho action ot
President Johnson towards tho late seced?
ing States, and such, from thc telegraphic
report of his message, wc infer, is thc
course he has recommended to Congress.
It will not be long, however, until thc pro?
blem be solved whether statesmanship and
conservatism, or radicalism and sectional
prcjndico shall hold sway in the councils ol
the nation. Every true and loyal citizen
every lover of his country -will carncstl;*
pray that thc former may prevail, and thai
ere long thc great work of restoration am
reconstruction will be fully completed.
The Charleston ?Veras has a good a rt iel?
on the condition of thc times. We extrae
the main portion of the article, and re
commend it to our readers:
Before the war began, they proclaims
an irrepressible conflict. Tiny claimci
power, the purpose to use it mercilessly
and forced tho conclusion that the pre
scrvation, rights and liberty was dependent
on ourselves. Throughout the war, their
conduct was not more conciliatory. They
hired soldiers from abroad; they armed
our slaves against ns; they burned our
houses and blasted our lands, without its
being apparent that these cruelties con?
tributed to conclude the war. That over,
they sent emissaries amongst us to stir
the*worst nature of thc negro-to divert
him fro31 employments which, necessary
to bis subsistence, might be profitable to
his recent master; to plant a principle of
hate between them, and render peaceful
relations no longer possible. And if it be
objected, after this, that we do not love
them, it is a sufficient answer, that thcy
cannot expect it. They are not so unrea?
sonable to require an occurrence so un?
natural, nor would any human testimony
be sufficient to convince them of tho fact.
But if it bc meant that wo do not, in
perfect faith, accept the situation, with all
the obligations and responsibilities arising
from it, thc proposition is not true. Not
only do we not propose a renewal of the
contest-which now, in the loss of slavery,
and the absence, therefore, of any peculi?
arity of social constitution to be preserved
by a peculiar Government, would be un?
necessary-hilt we honestly desiro the
restoration of thc Union. Wo desiro it for
thc selfish reason, perhaps, that any
condition would be welcomed from the
calamities of a conquered and depondent
province, but for the better reason, also,
that in trie Union only is there tho hope
of preserving the civilization of this
republic. The imperilled principio of rep?
resentative liberty has no other ark of
refuge now; and for the North and humani?
ty, as well as for ourselves, we would, of all
earthly things, the most desire the restora?
tion of the Union.
Nor is there the slightest thought to
disturb the question as to slavery. Wo
have not concurred in the policy of emanci?
pation; wo havo not thought it of ad?
vantage to negroes; wo have not seen the
reason to believe them fit for an equal place
in a community of white mon-many have
already perished-more, we fear, must
perish, and, perhaps, all must pass away;
we have not thought it of advantage to
white men; the sudden loss of property,
the disturbance of relations, thc mixture
of races, excited, as far as possible, to
madness with each other, have not im?
proved the condition of thc ruling class;
and if, in thia way, truth shall havo been
vindicated, wc cannot avoid tho feeling
that tho price has been too great; and
even truth should not be vindicated, in
the ruin of the only parties concerned
upon the subject of its vindication. But
wo do not purpose to resist the measure;
we do not purpose to ask a reconsideration
of the question. We do net dream that a
reconsideration is possible; or if it wore,
would we now accept it or bo willing to
restore the negroes to their late condition.
They were not then dangerous, but, with
the experience of the last few months, and
the efforts of emissaries to disturb them,
they would be now. The relation cannot
be restored, and the connection would be
intolerable without it.
Nor is there a feeling of infidelity to the
republic. There never has been. We did
not striko tho republic, but the party who
seemed to usurp it, and ever felt regret
that, to vindicate our liberties, wo had to
abandon our share in its grandeur and its
glories; and though now it has cost us an
effort to lay aside our form of society, from
no motive of our own, no perception nffiits
evils, and adopt another not more com?
mended by reason and experience, it is the
one consoling tl.ought that, by that ex?
hausting sacrifice, there is at least the
compensation that we may bo permitted
to re-enter the great republic, and re?
commence in that association the onward
march to thc bright destiny which is yet
within the range of ita achievements.
If it be r?bellions, therefore, not to en?
tertain feelings of personal regard for
those who have been constant ia their
efforts that we shall not, or not to feel
humiliated and debased by misfortune, or
not to acknowledge superior merit in those
who have not exhibited the qualities fitted
to inspire the sense of such superiority;
or if it. be tho exhibition ?f ? spirit which
unfits us for the Union, not to show a
nature too servile for association with
honorable men, then wo exhibit a rebel?
lious spirit, and it is but just that of such
rebellious spirit wo should meet the con?
sequences.
But if not -if fidelity to the Union shall
consist with proper self-respect-if it be
enough, to entitle us to the relation, that
we accept ita obligations and conditions,
that we adopt the policy of tho Govern?
ment, assume its fortunes and its fate, and
are ready to devote whatever we may have
of character and manhood to elevate and
sustain it-then we are not rebellious, if
the party in control of Congress be tho
republic, and a sense of loyalty to them
shall be loyalty to the republic, we are not
loyal; but if the republic be herself-if she
bu above faction and party, and it be loyal
to sustain her, and to strike even those
who would usurp and degrade her, then wo
are loyal. If there be a republic, to that
republic wo are loyal; if there bo not-if its
form has been usurped, and if faction
stalks in ita habiliments and desecrates its
sacred places, LO that semblance we are not
loyal; and no amount of suffering can de?
grade us to the act of such confession.

ME. EDITOR: I send you herewith a form
of contract for plantation purposes, ex?
tracted from the Abbeville Banner, which
you will find to jour interest to publish,
as this subject, of all others, is now upper
mo " in the minds of your readers. The
whola communication is worthy of perusal.

AT HOSIE, November 25, 1805.
MB. EDITOR: Never before, in the history
of our State, has the planting mind of the
country been so exercised as at the pre?
sent. Each neighbor is inquiring of his
still further oil neighbor, "How do you
propose regulating labor on your planta?
tion next year?" This one proposes to in?
terest tho laborer by giving him a propor?
tion of the crop; that ono thinks, as
"money made the mare go," it will bc thc
onlv effectual stimulus to the freedmen,
and hence proposes to pay monthly.
I advocate neither of those plans, but
prefer a mixturo of thc two, which simply
means to pav in money for the quantity
harvested. For instance, for each bale ol
cotton (400 pounds,) each bushel of corn,
peas, or small grain, for each gallon ol
syrup, and pound or hundred pounds ol
fodder, I propose paying so much, thc ag?
gregate being divided pro rata amongst
the hands, wno will, in the contract, bc
rated as full, three-quarters, or half hands.
Medical attendance and all other planta?
tion expenses to be furnished by thc
master, but deductions to be made at thc
expense of tho laborer, such as loss ol
time from any other cause than thal
created by the master, fines imposed and
boarding ?f children. "Eviction and dis?
charges to be within the power of th?
master at all times for disobedience, idle?
ness, or impudence.
Stock will be raised hy a servant nol
counted a field hand, whose pay will de?
pend upon tho number added to" the Hod
or herd, and the number of pounds ol
pork butchered. In a similar way is poul?
try to be grown. No employee will bc
allowed to raise chickens or cultivate t
patch for himself, and by no means to oin
a dog.
With these explanatory items, Mr
Editor, I give vou below my idea of a con?
tract for a plantation or farm working
seven hands. Of conrso the same wonk
answer in form and principle for any nu m
ber of bands:
FORM OF CONTRACT.
This agreement, made and entered inte
this the first day of January, 1?O0, betweei
John Smith on the one part, and suudr
freedmou on the other part, witnesseth:
That we, (freedmen,) whose names an
hereunto attached, do agreo and bind our
selves to labor, faithfully, for one year fo

and rendering it, by our industry, as pro
ductive, and the ensuing crop as abundan
as possible. That we will be obedient
humbl?, civil and polite to himself, hi
family, or agent; anet for violation of eithe
of these pledges render ourselves liable t>
the punishments, or either of them, men
tioncd below.
In consideration of the services abov
specified, I, John^Smith, do agree to hons
comfortably, feed liberally, and funds'
medical attendance for thc aforesaid freed
Tv>.->?, ilo<luoiii)(j, however, from timi

by any one of the laborers from sickness
or any other canso, except that created b
me.
I further agr. e to board and lodge th

freedmen at a monthly expense of $2 eacl:
and at thc end of tlfe year to pay the fiele
hands, stock-minder and poultry-womar
as follows: The field-hands, for each hal
uf cotton, (400pounds,) $10; foreaehbusln
of corn or peas, 20 cents; for each hui.
dred pounds of fodder, 20 cents; for eae
gallon of syrup, 10 cents; for harvestin
small grain, 5 cents per bushel; tiles
amounts to be aggregated and divide
amongst tba freedmen as rated belov
each lull hand receiving one-seventh of tb
whole net amount.
Thc stock-niindcr will receive, for enc
lamb or calf added to the flock or her

pound for each and every pound of por
butchered in the fall of 1K0G.
The poultry-woman will bc paid 5 cenl
for each head of poultry grown.
Any or all the freedmen parties to th:
contract ma}- be fined a sum not exceedin

eretion, appeal being granted in ease of
discharge to a Magistrate or the Distrii
Judge-loss of time occasioned by tl
appeal chargeable to thc offender.
All expenses incurred by reason of lav
regulating labor, approval of contract
taxes of freedmen, loss of time from wor!
ing roads, and boarding the (non-worker:
