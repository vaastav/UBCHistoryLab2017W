By "taking it all back" Delegate Kuhio has probably forestalled a
Republican political movement that would have ended his term. As
the matter stands he is still the choice of a great majority of the party.
President Taft's regular message to Congress, published nearly in
full in The Star today, contains nothing sensational. There are no
Rooscveltian phrases, no startling recommendations, no roasts of any
body. The document is calm, judicial, even dry. Yet there are some
interesting recommendations in it and its comparative brevity will en
courage many to read it. The President has nothing to say!
about Hawaii or the Philippines, excepting his references to military
and naval matters, with which the public is already familiar.
The San Francisco Chronicle sees in California and Hawaii cotton
experiments a chance for California to become a manufacturing State.
It says:
The time for a beginning is propitious. In "days past California
has had cotton -mills that did not do well. But there was no cheap
fuel, little cheap power, and that at a distance Jvom railways and
the market; and a comparatively small consuming population.
Now things have vitally changed. Oil fuel is abundant and cheap.
Long-distance transmission of electricity made by water power
is one of the items of progress. The State and the whole Coast
is settling up. We can .get before long an ample supply of cotton
within our own economic sphere, and we can manufacture it at a
-. profit. On the Pacific Slope is population enough to sustain the
textile end of the industry the" manufacturing and selling end.
Then why not cotton? '
This has been and is a cattle State, a gold State, a wheat State,
a commercial State, a wine and fruit State, an oil "State, and it
may as well become a manufacturing State.
In. this connection we also note that cotton is promised as an
export from California's ten-million-dollar trade preserve; the
Territory of Hawaii. Experiments have proved the high value of
the product there ; and now one of the eight islands of the Ha
waiian group is to be given up to the crop entirely. In time the
exports of cotton from Honolulu, joined with the Imperial valley
supply, may work marked economic changes in this State.

The bravery of the rescuers who lost their lives in the endeavor
to save the Imprisoned miners o Cherry has been extolled. Their
bodies have been laid to rest with honors. Their stories have been
told with tears, and yet with proud rejoycing. But deep In the shat
tered and poisonous mine, ImmurSa In a darknes that must have
seemed to them the beginning ot eternity, the doomed and helpless
workers displayed a bravery as majestic. It does not seem that
they gave way to senseless panic or that in the time of stress any
forgot his fellows. Dead forms were found clasping other dead.
Men had wrapped their coats about boys in the effort to defy the suf
focating gas. Bearing the burden of the weaker, Uiey had staggered
toward the outlet. And so the first to venture in from the outer
world came upon them, and realized that In the ranks of these humble
tollers were men of blood and Iron. The world gladly claims kinship
with these heroes.
Nothing could be more touching than the letters some of the vic
tims of disaster wrote when there had seemed to thenv no shadowy
chance of escape. On scraps of paper they scrawled messages of
love and farewell, disposed of their little property, and gave blessing
and counsel to the dear ones waiting hopelessly above. Hunger was'
gnawing at them. Hot fumes were scorching their lunss. All about
them In the charnai pit they know wero lying the comrades who had
not withstod the llery trial. Yet In that dreadful hour they were
calm. They could think without terror of their impending fate.
They could find consolation In song and prayer, and the last, recorded
Impulse that stirred them sprung not from fear and not from their
own suffering, but from concern for their wives and children.
The last wills and testaments made under such conditions are
certltlcates of such courage" as could be part only of a noble man

TERRIBLE FIGHT FOR LIFE
UNDER
FATHDWIS
OF
ITER
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Nov. JO.
Burled under tho weight of nearly"
GOO pounds oT blanket' fish. J. Roach,
one of the best-known submarine div
ers on tlie Pacific coast, recently
fought the battle of his life In 30
fathoms of water off tho coast of the
Mexican port of Manzanlllo. The dat
ing diver has Just arrived from tho
South. He is still suffering from tho
shock of his awful exierlence down
at the bottom dt- tho sea,, and it' is
doubtful if he will sufficiently re
cover to resume his hazardous occu
pation ot weeks.
Diver Roach was given tho contract
for bla&rig the coral out of the har
bor at Manzanlllo, and was engaged
in thU tarfif when he met tho most
thrilling experience in-all of his 3U
years of labor under tho sea." He has
fought shars and swordflsh; taken
chances of having playful whales sev
er his air tubes and has everi had to
cut his way to freedom through the
crushing arms of the octopus, but
never in all of the years that he has
been engaged in his profession, has
he ever, he says, felt so near his fin
ish as he did when attacked by the
blanket fish of the Mexican coast.
"You know the blanket fish, or
Mantha, as the scientific men call the
sea monster." said Roach, in relating
his experience, "grows to mammoth
dimensions and sometimes weigns
thousands of pounds. They are not
aggressive, ,llke the shark, bufc-vthey
hover over you In the wafer, allow
their giant fins to settle over you, and
there is not one chance In a thousand
,tg escape them.
"Down off ' the coast of Manzanlllo
where I have been working there
are many of these sea monsters, and
while I had often noticed their pres
ence in the winer near me, I was
very careful and never ran afoul
one until I had nearly completed my
'contract. I was more worried by
man eating sharks that swarmed
about me in hundreds. 1' was jusi
about to signal to be iiauled to the
surface, when I noticed what seemeu
to be an immense clou'd hovering over
me. Looking up, I was horrified to
see the slimy fins of the giant within
about a toot of my head.
"I tried to get from under, but "the
mighty fish had a spread of fin that
musHiave covered 50 feet sjiuare. The
bottom of the sea about me was as
black as night and slowly the mass
settled upon mo and I was firmly pin
ioned to the coral bottom of the bay.
"Every moment the air hose con
necting me with' the life giving'
tanks In the launcli above threatened
to be iarted. I wds' powerless to give
a signal to my assistant's in the
launch, and had I been able to Bignai
them, any attempt to relieve me
would have proved fatal, for the lines
would have parted hefore I could pos
sibly have been raised. I want to
tell you that I did some of the most
rapid thinking pf my career.
"Within a great effort, I managed
to reach my sheath knife. There
seemed io b,e Just one chance in a
thousand for relief. I would hack
away at the huge bulk with my knlte
until I could Inflict a sufficiently
painful wound tq get the great fish
in motion.
"Whllo" I was hacking away for
dear life, tho blanket fish started a
violent agitation of tho water and I
thought my knlfo play was begin
ning to tell. Tho giant fish' moved;
tlio water seemed to be, blood red;
I began to look about for the cause
of tho trouble for I knew I ha not
done such frightful execution with
my knlfo.
"Suddenly I discovered what haa
como to my rescue. It was tho man.
eating sharks. They had attacked
the blanket fish and wero driving It
before them to Its certain death. 1'
did not remain long under wafer to
see the outcome of the battle. I gave
tho. signal to haul me up and I was
Just about tho happiest man above
water when I stood on the deck of
the launch and noted the rapid work
of tho assistant's, who removed my
armor."
Editor Star: I no in this morning's
Advertiser that the walking races next
Sunday will start at half "past one in
stead of half past two, the change
having been made out of deference
to the management of a baseball game
which is to be played at the Athletic
park. It seems to me that as we have
baseball all the year round, whereas
the Kalakaua Avenue walking race
only occurs once a year, the tlme'ot
the latter event might be set so that
everyone may have a chance to wit
, ncss the contest. I understand that
; there are three races next Sunday,
viz: heaveywelght, veterans and open
contest. According to the morning
, paper It is proposed to start them
practically simultaneously. If this ls
done there is sure to be a mix-up and
what would otherwise have been a fine
' afternoon's sport will purely be spoiled,
It would be a good plan to start the
I heavyweight and veterans races to
gether at half p.ast one or two o'clock
and the open race, say at half-past
two or three o'clock. Then every
ono could see all three of the races
without hurrying dinner. The base
ball game can be played later; there'll
be lots of time next morith.
