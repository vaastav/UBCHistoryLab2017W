GRANTS PASS, ORE., FRIDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1910
OUR CHRISTMAS GREETING
Keeping abreast of the times, The Courier is issuini
special Christmas number of large proportions, which will
be sent to our subscribers as a holiday greeting. Ihis at
tractive publication will make known the advantages of
Grants Pass as a place to buy everything in the Christmas
and general holiday line. We point with pride to the large
display of seasonable advertisements and it is with great
pleasure we present the up-to-date showing of our mer
cantile establishments. This effort to properly observe
the Christmas occasion by issuing a high-class number of
a newspaper is in keeping with the twentieth century.
From start to finish this holiday issue is good and desir
able reading and it is quite certain to find a welcome in
every home. It should not be forgotten that a week from
Sunday is Christmas and that the blessed occasion comes
but once a year, so let us make the most of it to gather
around the yule log and be merry because it is the glad
day on which the Saviour of the world was born. While
we are getting ready to celebrate the great day by making
presents to our loved ones and friends, let us not forget
the poor and the needy, for they have a claim on us. Christ
has made our duty plain and commanded us to feed the
hungry, clothe the naked and remember the unfortunate.
would like to show my appreciation of the action of the
voters in electing me to tlv Inkiest ottice witnin tne gui
of" this municipality, and the only way I can give proof of
this fully and satisfactorily is by my action while holding
the office. I realize that there is much hard work to be
encountered by the next administration, but I feel that
there are no obstacles in the way. Of course there is de
tail work which must be looked after, but the most im
C. KIXXEV BOOSTS FOR
BETTER COUNTY ROADS
H. C. Kinney, who was a dalegate
to the good roads convention, was
Interviewed by the Telegram and de
livered himself of the following
booBt for good roads and for Grants
Pass: '
H. C. Kinney, of Grants Pass, who

portant work to begin with is the fitting up of an office for jvenJtkmf ls one 0f the most prominent
the auditor, and police judge, city attorney ana cuy engin
eer, as there are many valuable papers, which should be
looked after, and therefore must be a place to keep them.
Much has been accomplished during the present adminis-.
tration, but we have been handicapped by lack of system.
Grants Pass is growing and it is quite time that the mat
ers mentioned should receive attention. , I am at work on
a full spt of recommendations which will be placed before
he council at an early day, and until that time 1 do not
feel at liberty to follow this subject farther."
Mr. Myers understands full well that the office of
inayorof Grants Pass for the year 1911 will require much
more attention than in any year during the past. It is
pleasing to note that he is disposed to be conservative in
all city matters and, David Crockett like, he will be very
ikely to be sure he is right before he goes ahead.
STATE ROAD COMMISSIONER TO BE APPOINTED
L. R. Webster, of the Good Roads Association of Ore
gon, is hard at work with some of his associates drafting
a bill creating a state highway commission. Under the
new order of road building in Oregon this is a very im
portant matter and it will command the best efforts on the
part of the legislature.
The bill is to provide for the appointment of a high
way commission of three members who shall receive no
pay. Their term of office shall be for two, three and four
years each. The first function of the commission will be
to appoint a state highway commissioner, who will have
supervision of the construction of all state roads as well
as all roads where crushed rock and gravel are used.
The salary of the commissioner is fixed in the bill at
$4000 a year, and provision is made that he must be an ex
pert in road construction. He will be allowed a clerk at
$150 a month.
The commissioner will be required to report to the
legislature at each session with statistics on roads and a
full account of operations.
This bill will be passed on by the Good Roads conven
tion, after which it will be ready for presentation at the
opening session of the legislature. The Good Roads Asso
ciatiou of Oregon has been doing a wonderful work for
the people and it is itlcasincr to note that it has been appre
ciated. The great public need has long been a better
knowledge of road construction. County courts have, of
course, done the best they could, but not being experts it
was to be expected that thev would make occasional mis
takes. A state highway commissioner who will have sup
ervision of all roads where crushed rock and crave! arc
used will be a step in the right direction and will assis
great lv in the securing of permanent roads. We must al
admit that knowledge is power and in road building this
applies with groat iorce, as it will enable us to secure bet
ter results than could be obtained without this important
aid. If we can have each year a few miles of permanent
JOSEPHINE COUNTY MUST LEAD
The good roads convention held in Portland last Mon
day, was without exception the most representative, the
most important and the most popular gathering that has
ever taken place in the state. Every county wTas repre
sented and there seem to be able men in every delegation.
Oregon has long been preparing for just such a meeting
and if the legislature will complete the work started by
the convention every county, we believe, will act promptly
and inaugurate the construction of permanent roads. The
courier has plead with the county court for years for the
construction of one mile, or even a half a mile, of perman
ent road in order that we might have an object lesson such
as the city of Grants Pass has given in its bitulithic pave
ment; but the court could not see its way clear to do this
and so the matter has remained until the late election,
when all candidates nominated were placed on a good
roads platform.
H. C. Kinney, of this city, said at the convention that
the county court of Josephine county could be depended
upon to inaugurate the good roads movement. Let us hope
that he is not mistaken and that promptness will be the
very essence of the work the court has in hand. It is the
solemn duty of every citizen to assist in this matter. Even
the starting of the work will attract to us the home seeker
and the investor and, therefore, this part of the Rogue
river valley should be foremost in the construction of per
manent roads. i
The preliminary work to be undertaken is in the legis
lature and it is the duty of. the people of the county to in
struct our members to assist in the passage of the laws
recommended by the good roads convention. The Jose
phine county members must be instructed to act with
energy that the people of the state and of the whole coun
try, for that matter, may know that Josephine count)

through the good roads movement. The commercial
club of Grants Pass must be induced to assist not only
the "legislature but the county court in carrying forward
this seemingly new idea of permanent road construction,
which is, after all, 3000 years old. Few of us would have
thought that Oregon was that many years behind the
times, and yet there is abundant proof that it is so. But,
thank God, the eleventh year in the new century will be
the dawn of better things, which will place every county
in this state in the van of the permanent road building.
citizens of Josephine county, and for
manv years he has been foremost in
every work which has been started
for the upbuilding of southern Ore
gon. For more than a quarter of a
century he has been a buslnss man
of Grants Pass and has for the last
few' years been active in securing
for that section the benefits of irri
gation, he being a director in the
Josephine County Irrigation and
Power company. He has seen Grants
Pass grow from a hamlet of a few
houses to a bustling city of 5000
people.
Mr. Kinney said he and the other
delegates from Josephine county had
done what they could in the conven
tion to help the good roads move
ment and that they will go home well
pleased with what was accomplished.
Our county gave a substantial
majority, for the amendment to the
constitution and I believe if the leg
islature will pass the bills' recom
mended by the convention there will
be no difficulty in bonding Josephine
county in the Interest of good roads.
The county court was elected on a
good roads platform and If the means
are available I feel quite sure cf the
result.
"We hope this year to have our
Irrigation matters in such shape as
greatly to benefit not only the farm
ers of the vicinity, but the business
men of the city of Grants Pass.
Whenever we get the water on the
lands adjoining Rogue river as it is
one either side of the Applegate river
and a portion of the Illinois valley,
we will develop not only the fruit
industry, but we will have the best
agricultural section in the United
States.

PENSION FOR GOVERNMENT CLERKS
There is one subject treated by President Taft in ln
message that deserves prompt action, and that is his rec
ommendation to congress for some provision for retiring
superannuated government clerks. There arc many em
ployes in the various departments of government who
have been in their places on moderate salaries for half a
century. These clerks have rcallv run their branches of
government. They were the men whose services incom
ing officeholders could not dispense with and it is a well
known fact that they have contributed largely to the
honor and glory of our country and should be retired on
suitable pensions, thus proving that the American people
appreciate the work they have performed for the uaj
tional government.
BUILDING AND LOAN ASSOCIATION
The organization in Grants Pass of a building and loan
association would meet an active demand for homes by
that worthy class who draw salaries from our stores,
mines, manufacturing plants and other industries. Build
ing and loan societies have furnished thousands upon
thousands of families in many of the states with homes
which were paid for out of the family savings. The class
who make a city are the owners of the homes. The board
ing house is all right, as well as the house that is rented,
but the family living in its own home is the strongest
element in society. Grants Pass is ready for the building
and loan association. All it needs is someone to make the
start and this would seem to be the work of a committee
chosen by the commercial club.
