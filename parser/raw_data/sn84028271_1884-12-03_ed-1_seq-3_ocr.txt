CONOO BASIN.
Pursuant to the advice of the Penato at the
last session I recognised the tlag of the In
ternational Association of tho Congo as that
of a friendly government, avoiding In ao
doing any prejudgment of oontllot In ter
ritorial claim in mat region, ana euose-
quetitiy. In elocution or wo e pressed wixn
of tho Congress. 1 appointed a commercial
agent for tho Congo baain. The importance
of the rich prospective trade of the Congo
Valley ha led to the general conviction that
It should be open to all nation upon euual
terms. In the International Confvrenco for
tho consideration of tbla subjeet, called by
the Kmperor of Germany, and now In aeaalon
at Merlin, delegates are In attendance on be
half of the United Unites. Of the result of
the Conference you will be duly advlaed.
Tho Government or Coroa ha generously
Ided theetrort of the United States Minister
to secure suitable nremlsoa for the use of
the legation. Aa the conditions of diplo
matic Intercourse with KaaUirn nation de
mand that the legation premises do owned
br the represented newer. I advise that an
appropriation bo made for the acquisition of
this property by the Government. The
United Btate already pnssesaes valuable
prnmlsoa at Tangier aa a gift from the Hultan
of Morocco, and, as la ataled hereafter, they
have lately rocelvi'd a similar gift from tbe
Siamese Government. The Government of
Japan stands ready to rent tolls extensive
grounds at Toklo, wherein toereot a suitable
building for tho Legation, a court house and
jail, and similar privileges can probably be
secured In China anil Persia. The owning of
ucti premises would not only elf cot a large
saving or me present rental, out wouiu
permit of the due assertion of extra terri
torial right In these countries, and wnuM
the belter serve to maintain tbe dignity of
tbe United Btutoa. '
Tbe failure of Congress to make an appro
priation tor our representation at ine Auun
onions Court of the Khedive ha proved a
serious embarrassment in our Intercourse
with Kgypt, and In view of tho necessary
In 1 1 many of dlplomstlo relationship, due to
the oartleliiation of this Government as one
of tbe treaty powers In all matter of admin
istration there affecting the rights of for
eigner. I advise the restoration of the
Agency and Consulate General at Cairo o
Ita former basis. I do not conceive It to he
tbe wish of Congress that tho United Htntos
should withdraw nltoguthrr from the honor
able position they nave hitherto neid witn
resneet to the Khndlvo. or that cllliens o
thla Henuhllo residing or sojourning In F.gypl
should hereafter be without the aid and pro
tection or a competent representative.

With France the traditional cordial rela
tionship continues. The llarthnldl Htatlle of
Liberty Enlightening the world, tho gener
ous girt of the people of France, la expected
to reach Now York in May next. I suggest
that Congressional action lie, taken In rela
tion to tho spirit which has prompted tills

Our relations with Germany, a country
which contributes to our own some of the
best element of citizenship, continue to be
cordial. The United Ktalea have extradition
treaties with seve ral of tho Gorman ttlntoa,
tint by reason of the confederation of those
States under the Imperial rule, the applica
tion of such treaties is not as uniform and
comprehnnslvo as tho Interest of the two
countries require. 1 propose therefore, to
open negotiations for a single convention of
extradition to embrace all tbo territory of
. the Kmplro.
It afford me nlensuro toaay that our Inter-
Oourae with Great lirltaln oontlnues to bo of
moat friendly character, ihe (lovornment
of Hawaii haa Indicated Its willingness
continue for seven year tho provlalona of
theeilstlng reciprocity treaty. Huoh con
tinuanoe, lu view of the rclalloue of that
country to the American system of States,
should In my Judgment bo favored.
The revolution In Haytl against the estab
lished Government has terminated. While It
waa In progress It became necessary to en
force our neutrality laws by Instituting pro
ceeding against Individuals and veaaels
charged with their Infringement. The prose
ant Ions were in all cases auoceasful.
Much anxiety has lately boon displayed by
various European uovernmnnia, ana es
pecially by the Government of Italy, for the
abolition of our import duties upon work
Of art. HI well to consider whether the

to remit, a they themselves aeetn very gen
erally to believe It may, In tbe practical ex
clusion of our palmers and sculptor from
the rich Held for observation, study and
labor whleh they have hitherto enjoyed.
There Is prospects that the long pending
revision of tho forelgu treaties of Japan may
bo concluded at a new eonfurnaee to be held
at Toklo. While thla Government fully reoog-
nines the Independent atatlon or Japan In the
community of Nations, It would not oppose
, tbe general adoption of such terms of com-

During the past year tho increasing good
will between our own Govor tmont and that

J no legislation will, 1 aouoi not, do among

A full treaty of commerce, navigation, and
consular right Is much to be desired, and
Biicn n treaty, 1 have reason to hcllovc ine
Mexican Government atanda reiulr to con
clude. Homo embarrassment ha been occa
sioned by the failure of Congress at Its last
session to provide means ror tno duo exoou
tlon or tho treaty of July at, Ihhs, for the re
survey of the Mexican boundary and tbe re
location of boundary monuments.
With tho Itepuhllo of Nicaragua a treaty
ha boon concluded which authorl7.es the
construction by the United Htntcs of a canal,
railway und tolcgrupli lino acrosa tho Nloa
rttgtiau territory. My tho terms of this
treaty alxty ml Ins of the Ulver Han Juan, as
well a Lake Nicaragua, nn Inland aea forty
miles in width, arc to constitute a part of tho
projected enterprise. This covers for the
nciuai cnnai ooiiMruciion ox aovenieeii
mile on the Paclllo ahlo and thirty-six ontho
Atlantic. To the United States, whoso rich
territory on the I'ncillc Is for tho ordlnury
purpose of commerce practically cu off
from communication by witter with tho AU
Inntlc ports, tho political and commercial ad
vantages of such a project can scarcely be
over estimated It is lielloved that when tho
trout y Is laid before rou the JuMIco anil lib
erality or Ita provisions will command uni
versal approval at home ami abroad.
Tho death of our representative at Russia
wlille at his post at .St. Petersburg afforded
to inn imperial tiorcrnmeni a reneweu op
portunity to testily Ita sympathy in a man
ner befitting ihq lutliniito friendship which
has ever marked tho Intercourse of tlio two
countries.
The coiiiso of th a Government In raising
Its representation at llnngkok to the diplo
matic rank has evoked from Slam evidences
of warm friendship and augurs well for our
enlarged Intercourse. Tho Siamese Govern
ment has pi-esontcjl to the United Statoa a
commodious mansion nna grounus ior me
occupancy of tho Legation, und I auggest
mm, ny joint resolution, i ougress attest its
appreciation of this generous gift.
This Government has more than once been
called upon of Into lo take action In filllil
monts of Its International obligations toward
Spain, agltallon lu tho Island of Cuba hostile
to tho Spanish Crown having been fomented
by poraons abusing the sncred rights of hos
pitality which our territory adonis. The
oflleers of tho Government have beon In
structed to exercise vigilance to urevont In
fractions of our neutrality laws nt Key West
and at other points near tbo Cuban coast.
and I am happy to say that In the only in
stanco whoro theso precautionary measures
were successfully eluded, the offenders,
whon found In our territory, wore subse
quently tried and convlctod. Tho growing
need of close relationship, of intercourse
and t radio between the Soanlsh Antilles und
their natural market in the United Unites, led
to tbo adoption in January last of a commer
cial agreement looking to that end. This
ugroomeiit has since been superseded by a
moro carcfullv framed and coninreheiisivo
convention, which I shall submit to tlio Sen
ate for approval. It haa been tho aim ot this
negotiation to open suoh a favored recipro
cal exchange of productions carried under
tno nag of eitner country as to maxo me in
tercourse between Cuba and Porto Hlco and
ourselves scarcely less Inllmato than tho
commercial movement between our domes
tic ports, and to insure a removal of tho bur
dens on shipping In tho Spanish Indies, of
wnion in tno past our snn owners ana snip
masters nave so often nan cnuso to com
iduin. The negotiation of this convention
has for a time postponed the prosecution of
certain claims of our citizens which wore
declared, to bo without the Jurisdiction of
tho late Bnanlsh-Amerlcan Claim Commis
sion, snd which aro therefore remitted to
tllplomatlo channel ror adjustment, ine
speedy settlement of these claims will now
no urged uy tno uovornincnt.
Negotiations for a treaty of commercial
reciprocity with the Dominican Kepirtillo
have been successfully concluded ana ino
result will shortly be laid before tho Semite.
Certain nuestlons between the United
States and tlio Ottoman Kmplro still remain
unsolved. Uomnlalnts in behalf of rsir clll
iens are not satisfactorily adjusted. Tho
Porte has aought to withhold from our com
merco tho right of favored treatment to
which wo are entitled bv existing conven
tional stipulations and the revision of the
tariff is unaccompnsnca.
The final disposition of pending questions
witn Venezuela naa not a yet ooen roaenca,
but I haro good reason to expect an early
settlement, wuion win provide me means ni
re-examlnlng the Caracca award In con
formity with the exiircssod desire of Con
gress, and which will recognize the Justice of
certain claims preferred against vonezucia.

INTUINATIOSAL. EXHIBITION.
Thla Government hi In frequent receipt of
invitations f mm foreign htatea to participate
In International exlubltlona, often of great
Interest and Importance. Occupying as we
do an advanced position In the world' pro
duction and desiring to secure a profitable
share for our Industrie In the general com
petitive markets, It la a mutter of serious
oononrn that the want of means for partici
pation In these exhibitions should so often
exclude our producer from advantages en
joyed by those of other countries, and during
the past year the attention of Congress was
drawn to the rormai invitations in mis rcgara
tendered by the Government of Kngland,
Holland. Ilelslum. Gormany and Austria.
The Executive ba In omo Instances ap-
Eolntcd honorary Commissioners. 1 his is,

giving to th Executive general discretionary
authority to acoept such Invitation and to
appoint honorary Commissioners, without
salary, and placing at tho disposal of the Sec
retary of State a small fund fur defraying
their roaannablo oxikiiiscs, would bo of great
puuuo utility.
COLLISIONS AT SKA.
This Government has received official no
tice that the revised international regula
tions for preventing collisions at sea have
been adopted by all the lending maritlmo
fiowcrs except the United Stales, and came
ii to forco ou the 1st of September last. For
the due proteotjon of our shipping Interest
the provision of our stulutos should at once

MCCftSITr or intxknational coptkiqut,
The miration of securing to author, com.
poser and artists copyright privileges to
mis country in return ior reciprocal ngnts
abroad I one that may Justly challenge your
attention. It la true that a convention will
be necessary for fully accomplishing thl re
sult, nut until congress snau, uy statute, nx
the extent to which foreign holders of copy,
rights shall be hero privileged It ha been
deemed advisable to negotiate such conven
tions. For thl reason the United States
wore not represented at tbe reoent confer
ence at Home.
A BLOW AT Till DrWAStlTIRS.
I recommend that the scope of the neutral
ity law of the IHilted states be so enlarged
as to oover all nutent acts of hostility com
mlttod In our territory and aimed against the
peace of friendly nation. Existing statutes
prohibit the fitting nut of armed expeditions
and restrict the shipment of explosives,
though th enactment in the latter respect
were not framed with regard to Internatloaal
obligations, but simply for the protection of
naasenger travel, and all those statutes were
intended to meet special emergencies tbat
bad already arisen. Otheremergencles have
arisen slnco, and modern Ingenuity supplies
means for the organization of hostilities
without open resort to armed vessel or to
fllllniHtArltiBF nitrite. I see no -reason why
overt preparations In this country for tho
commission of criminal acts, such as are
here under consideration, should not an oo
punishable, whether auoh aots are Intended
to be committed in our own country or lu a
fornlirti nountrv with whleh we are at nonce.
Tho prompt and thorough treatmont of this
question is one wniou intiuiuteiy concerns
the Nationai honor.
NATURALIZATION LAWS.
Our existing naturalisation laws also need
revision. Those sections relating to persons
roaldlng within the limits of tho United
Slates In 17UA and 17118 bnve now only a histor
ical Interest. Section SITU recognizing the
citizenship of the children of naturalized
parents I ambiguous in its form and partly
obsolete. There aro special provision of
the law ravoring tno naturaiKaiion or mono
who servo In tho army or In merchant ves
sels, while no similar privileges aro gruutod
those who servo In tho Navy or in the Marino
Corns, and a uniform rule of naturalization
such as the (.'(institution contemplate
should, among other things, clearly define
tho status of persons born within the Unitod
Stales subject to a foreign power Section
and or minor children of fathers who
have declared their Intention of becoming
ell Incus, but bnve fulled to perfect their nat
uralization, jt might on wine to provHie ior
a Central llurcaii of ltoglstry, wheroln should
bellied authenticated transcripts of every
record of naturalization In the several Fed
eral and Stale Courts, and ninko provisions
for the vacation or cancellation of such
record lu cases v. hern fraud hud been prac
ticed upon tho court by the applicant him
self or where ho hud removed or forfeited
his acquired citizenship. A Just and uniform
law in tins respiHit would strongmen inn
hamls of tho Government in protecting Its
citizens abroad find would nave the way for
the conclusion of treaties of naturalization
with foreign ooiinlrles.
I'.MWlKK If KIlrtTIONS.
The legislation of the lust session effected
In the Diplomatic find Consular sorvloe cer
tain changes and reductions which have

HaXOMMKNIlXI).
I concur with the Secretary of theTreaury
in recommending the linmislinto suspension
of the coinage of silver certllleate. This Is
a matter to which. In former communica
tions, 1 have more than once Invoked the at
tention of the National Legislature. It ap
pears that annually for tho past six year
there have boon coined. In compllniico with
the requirements of tho act of February 2S,
1K7K, more than twenty-seven million silver
dollars. The number now outstanding I re
Mirted by tho Secretary to ho nearly one
hundred and eight v-llve-mllllons, wheress
but litt le less than forty million, or less than
22 percent., aro lu actual circulation. The
more existence of thla fuct seems to me to
furnish of Itself a cogent argument for the
repeal of tho statute whleh ha made such a
fuct possible, but thore are other and graver
consideration that tend In the same direc
tion. The Secretary avow his conviction
that unless this oolnage and the Issuance of
silver certificate be suspended, silver Is
llkoly nt no distant day to become our sole
metallic standard. Tho commercial disturb
ance and the Impairment of National credit
that would be thus occasioned can scarcely
he overestimated, I hopo that the Seero
tury'a suggestions respecting the withdrawal
from circulation tho two-dollar notea will ro
ccivtvour approval. It la likely that aeon
aldernliln portion of tho silver now Incum
bering the vaults of tho Treasury might thus
find it way Into tho currency.
abolition or rjtnsg nmr.
In mv annual measage of I recom
mended tho abolition or all exclae taxes ex
cept those relating to distilled spirits, This
recommondution i now renewed. In cuso
these taxes shall be abolished the revenues
that will still remain to thoGnvernment will,
In my opinion, not only suffice to meet Its
reasonable expenditures, but will afford a
orpin large enough to permit such tariff
reduction aa may seem to Ihs advisable when
tho results of the recent revenue laws and
commercial' treaties shall have shown In
what quarters theso reduction cau be moat
Judiciously effected.
One of tno gravest of Ihe problem whleh

Secretary of the Treasury advise that the
duty of Investigating thl subject be en

The bond of that Issue still outstanding
amount to little over ajfxl.onn.dno, about one
fourth of which will be retired through the

thschlef basis for the circulation of the

the contraction of tlieourrenoy caused by

Ing Importance. It seems to' be generally I
oonceded that t he law governing this matter I
exacts from the bunk excessive security
ana inai upon tneir present bond deposits a

be granted with safety. I hone t hat the bill

KXTK.NOINII KOUKIUN TK.1IIR,
III tho course of ibis comniuiikutlon refer
ence bus more than once been nnide to the
policy of the Government as regurds the ex
tension of our foreign free trade. It seems
proper to declare the general principles that
should, In my oplnlou, underlie our National
efforts in this direction. Tho intiln conditions
of the problem may bo thus slated: We are
a people iu mechanical pursuits and fet-tllo
In invention; wc. rover u vast e tent of terri
tory rich in agricultural products und In
nearly all the raw lniitcriuls necessary for
successful mnuiit'acliire. We have a system
of productive estubllshuients more than suf
llciont to supply our own demands. The
wages of labor ure nowbero else so groat.
Tlio scale of living of our artlsnii classes Is
suuh as tends to secure their personal com
fort and tho dcvclopcmcut of those higher
morals and Intellectual qualities that go to
the milking of good citizens. Our system of
tux mid t ii rl (T legislation la yielding a reve
nue which is in excess of the present nncda
of tho Government. These are elements from
which It Is sought lo devise a scheme, by
which without unfavorably changing tho
condition of tho worklugiucn, our merchant
marine shall bo raised from Its cnfoehlod
condition and new iniirkrts provided for the
sulo beyond our borders oT tho manifold
trull of our Industrial enterprises. The
problem is complex nnd can be solved by no
single measure of Innovation or rolorm. Tho
countries of Ihe American Continent und tbo
adjacent Islund aro for tho United States
the mil uriil market of supply and demand.
It is from them that we should obtain hat
wo do not produce in sulltclency, and It Is to
them thut tho surplus production or our
Holds, our mills and our workshops should
(low under conditions that will equalize or
favor them ill comparison with foreign com
petition. Four paths of policy seem lo point
to this end: '
First. A scrle of reciprocal commercial
treaties with the couutrlesof America which
shall rosier between us and them an un
hampered movement of trade. The condi
tions of those trcutles should be the free
admission of such merchandise as this coun
try does not produce In return for thn ad
mission frvo or under a fuvored scheme of
our products. The benefits nf such exchange
to upply on theso goons i-arrleu under me
flag of the parties to tho contract; tho re
moval on both sides from vessels so priv
ileged or nil Ioiiiuiko due and National Im
ports, so that their vessels may ply unhind
ered between our port und those of tho
other contracting parties, though without
Infringing on tho reserved home coasting
ttnde; Ihe removal or reduction of tho bins
den nn thn exported product of those
countries coming wilhln the benefits of the
treaties, and the uvolduiico or ine lecnnicul
restrictions and penalties by which our in
tercourse witb those couutrlos Is at present
bnmpered.
Secondly. The establishment of the Con
sular si-rvico of tho United States on a sal
aried folding, thus permitting tho relinquish
ment of Consular fees, not only a respect
vessels under tho National flag, but also as
n.-snects vessels carrying goods eutitlod to
the benefits or tho treutiea.
Thirdly. Tho enactment or measures to
fuvor tbe construction und miiluteiiutice of a
ateain-ciirrying marine under the bug of tbe
United Mates.
Fourthly. The establishment of a uniform
currency basis for tho countries of America,
so that the coined products of our mines
muy circulate on equal terma throughout
the wiiole system oi lommnnwciiiins,
PIIOTKITION ANU Til AOS
mar thua be turned to good account: that
the revenue may be reduced ao aa to no
longer overtax the people; that protective
duties may be retained, without becoming
burdensome; that our shipping Interests
may bo Judiciously encouraged, the currency
llxed on a firm basis, and nbovo all such a
unlly of interests established among tho
Stutea of the American system as will be of
great nnd cver-lnerciislng advantage to them
all. All the treaties In the line or this policy
which have hicn negotiated erare In process
of negotlntioti contiiin a provision deemed
to bo requisite under the clause of tbe Con
stitution limiting to the Ilouso of Repre
sentatives the authority to originate bill for
