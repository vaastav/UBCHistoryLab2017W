Reopening of ConfTOj?Ttao President's 31ev
aaue?Senatorial Cfilicismn? l)in?atl&t"rtctiou
wiili the President's Alluvions to Cuba.
The meeting of Congress to-day wan markoipby no
extraordinary features. In both houses the pro
ceedings were conflued almost strictly to the ordi
nary routine ol business at the commencement or a
cession, and were it not lor tho presentation of
President Grant's first message, for which everybody
liere, and in fact tue whole country, was looking
with the greatest interest and anxiety, tlio reopen
ing to-day would have been feariu ly dull. The
galleries were crowded, but ihe floor whereon the
legislators were gathered m tolenb;y full num
bers was unproductive cl a solitary sensation
worth noticing. Senator- and members greeted
each other warm'.v, crccSed th< lr jokes. receive<l'.he
congratulations of their fr:e..ds, talked over past
nnd future events and theu ui -ided, waiting appa
rently for tho President'* me.^sge or something else
to turn up which would atlurd iiiem the proper cue
lor action. In t'ae Senate there was an ivas' mblnxc
which made up lu brilliancy what it lacked in nuai- |
Iters. The galleries were well tilled with the (lite of
the capital and tue wives and daughters of the
??potent, grave and reverend seiguors." The diplo
matic box was era ed by v.r. Thornton, the British
Minister; M. XttiopUon IJaetzzt, Secretary of the
luikish Legation; S '.or radua y Meury, of tho
Brazilian Legation: young Bodisco and a few other
gentlemen. Mr. Thornton watched the proeceJ
lags with a roo.1 deal ol Interest, ami
paid essentia! attention while the message was be ink'
read. That part bearing upon our relations with
Great Britain and other European governments
caused Mr. Thornton to lean forward as far as po
liteness would permit, In order not to lose a word
of it, but whether Mr. Thornton felt disappointment
or satisfaction could not be fathered from his coun
tenance. Arnouar Senators themselves the message
as a whole was received with satisfaction. They
epofce ol the document as very creditable to the
Executive in its general treatment of questions ol
public concern, though In regard to some
points they did not hesitate to express
their dlsscat. The disposition to criticise was
manifested particularly In regard to his views
about Cuba and the financial question.
On the latter question a majority evl- |
flcntly endorsed ntm in the main, but there was
ejme disappointment felt that he did not make some ,
more satisfactory a'.ius.ous and suggestions respect
ing the Cuban revolution. The allusion to the Com- '
cussloner of internal Revenue and tho raising of his
pay and position to a standard commensurate with
the onerous dunes of that official is known to be a
de3tre on the part of the President to elevate that
onicial to a Cabinet minister. The President believes
that the luterual Revenue Commissioner discharges
Cu ies of such a high order, and that his ofllre
Is likely to be neetlel for such a protracted
period?twenty or thin? years longer?that it
is only a simple act of justice to give liini a salary
w inch will be In some measure remunerative. It re
quires a man ol first class ability, ono of Isrgo view*?
and extensive business experience, and if such a
man is expected to give his whole attention
to tho otllce he ought to be paid lor his services, both
with a substantial salary and official honor, such as
would attach to a member of the President's Cabi
net. From what can be gathered in conversation
with Senators and Representatives it is not lively
that this recommendation ol the lTesident will re
ceive favorable consideration. Last session an
etfirt was made to erect the Indian liarenu,
Laud Olllce, Agricultural Bureaa and Pension
titTlee into one lar;e consolidated department, with
its head in the Cabinet as an additional member,
but it railed signally, and it is believed that Congress
will not look with an. more favor u^oa the propo.4- i
lion to make the Internal Revenue Commissioner a
Cabinet o.Ucor. 1 may add. also, that Senators gene
rally don't seem to endorse the proposed abrogation
of the civil Teuure act. Tiieir opposition seems not
to spring so much from a dc?irc to continue their
Immense control over tho executive patronage as
from an aversion logo back, as tho saying is. upon
ti.eir frequently rocordc l views. To abolish civil
tcnuie, they Bay, "would ih> to eat up o ir
own words, and wj dou't feel dispose! to
do that. President Grant need have no fear that no
will embarrass him in the leas but we thmk lie
may tw well lot civil tenure alone, at least for the
present." Senator Sumner und ins inends consider
that ^e President in hi3 Mes-age has endorsed the
Massachusetts statesman's views on the Alabama
claims, and they are immensely delighted over it.

At an early hour this morning the president was
in His cilice, with his secretaries, again reviewing
bis message. Before twelve o'clock the document
was entuel.v ready, and tne President himself
awaited an official notification of the meeting of
two two houses of Cong e g. fhorty i?efore one
o'clock the Joint Committee, couai.-ung of Messrs.
Wilson and Thuriuau, oa the ]>art of tlie Venule,
and Messrs. ScheucK, liawes anl Woodward
on tho part of the House of Represen
tatives, readied the Kxecative Mansion
and were Immediately shown into the President's
otiico. After they had formally announced tuo ob
Jeet of their visit both parties engaged in a brief
conversation. Tuo President observed that he bad
been up until four o'clock tins morning delib
er.iiing upon tlie message to tee wJiether ho
bud lorgotten anything. Alter five uiluutos delay
tlio committee left on their return to the Capitol.
As soon as tne committee had gone General Porter,
8<cre lary to the President, left also for I ha Capitol
with the message and a large number ol appoint
ments.
The menage was received in the House at a qinr
terti two o'clock, and was immediately read by the
Ci ik the reading occupying exactly three-quarters
of un hour. As the members were not supplied
with printed copies, and as tho great mass of
them were entirely ignorant of iia contents,
they ga\e the closest attention to the read
ing. it may bo safely stated no Presidential
me sage has heen listened to wiui so much interest
by the House of Representative! for many years.
hen that portion of the document was readied
which reeommends taut an act b# passed author
ising the uoveruor ot Georgia to conveue the mem
bers originally elected to tne Legislature, requiring
each member to tako tho oatli prescribed by
tuu reconstruction ncis, and none to be admitted
wuo wore ineligible under the third clause
ol tho fourteenth amendment, some one
on the floor said, "Well, that'll radical enough," end
immediately there was a burst of spplause on tho
repubilcau aide, followed by hisses on tne demo
crats aide. lUe uemtuiauation, winch was ol a
momentary character, was suppressed by the
Speaker, wbo brought down his gavel with
Brest force upon his desk. The recommenda
tions about too finances were received with varied
feelings, according as they seemed to square with
the preconceived opinions of the members, llie
Western men were evidently disappointed at the
President favoring what they regard as a contraction
policy, while trie Eastern members nodded assent.
The plan proposed for a resumption of speclo pay
ments seemed to particularly please General Gar
Held wno looked around among his colleagues as
much a* tosav, "That's iuy plan." 11 will be observed
that the I'resldent's Ideas on this subject are sub
stantially those set forth tjy General Gartleld in his
Interview with your correspondent a week ago. A
cloud seemed to come over the faco of Coburu, of
Indiana, and some others who are in tavor of inflat
ing the currency, and thus getting further away
from specie payments, "llere comcs Cuba,"
whispered several members to each other as the
cierK read the sentence?"Aa the United States Is the
freest ol all nations, so, too, Its people sympathizes
with all peoples struggling for liberty and self-gov
ernment." But there wna a good deal o( disap
pointment In the House, as well as in the Senate, at
what followed on this subject, for in the
House there is a strong sentiment. no
doubt inspired by the people, in fuvor of recogniz
ing the Cubans as belligerents. Of course the an
nouncement that the question ol renewing
a treaty for reciprocal trade between ibo
United Statas and the British provinces
ling not been favorably considered by
the administration, was particularly wclcomo
to tbe Pennsylvania and some of the New England
members. Kelley looked around and nodded his
tica^approvlngiy at John Covotle who sat behind
him, while Negley, from the Pittsburg district,
smiled good naturcdiy at some of his Pennsyl
vania colleagues near him. "That brains the
Canadian lobby," was the general re
mark among tlie anti-reclproclty members.
The recommendation for the repeal of
the Tenure of Oilice act created some amusement,
especially among the democrats, who seemed to
think It a good joke at the expense of the republi
cans. lieu liutler moved around rather uneasily In
his seat when this part of the message was read,
and Judge Woodward, of Pennsylvania, winked
knowingly at Bingham, who sits near him, as if ho
would say, "There's/onsistency for you. What do you
Impeachment managers think of that?" The general
opinion of the republicans seems to be that this part
uf the message had better have been omitted. As
many of them are on record os having made elabor
ate ic^ai arguments on the constitutionality of nils
law, they arc at a loss to know how they can go
back atid repeal '*? Tlie suggestion that the salaries
of certain government ofllcials be Increased, was
another point In tho message that provoked
a smile, especially the statement that Congress had
on several occasions Increased the compensation of
Us own members. Some malicious member sug
gested that probably that part of tne message had
been dictated by Attorney General lloar In anticipa
tion of his going upon the bench of Supreme Court.
The general opinion of the members of both parties is
that taken 03 a whole the messa^o Is creditable to
the i'rcsident, though of course some of its recom
mendation do not meet the approval of either repub
licans or democrats.
Uepubllr-nn Caucus.
The republican Senators after adjournment to
day held a brief cancus, the business transacted
being the appointment of a comrnitteo to report on
lUiiug vacancies in standing committees caused by
the deuth ol Air. Fessenden and the resignation of
Mr. Grimes.
Tbj Philadelphia Petition lor Cuba.
Senator Cameron appeared as Hie champion of
the Cubans in the Senate to-day. He presented the
petition of the phll&delplilans, asking the recogni
tion or the Cubans, wh.ch was ordered to lie on the
table. The petition, containing over a0,0jo names,
v. as wound around a large reel, which was carried
from the Senate Chamber to the Clerk's oillce by one
ol the pages, amid some merriment.
Oreun Telegraph Cafiles.
The President, to-day sent to tlie Senate a message,
enclosing the correspondence relative to ocean
cables, lroin Minister Washbnrne, dated Paris,
October 5. He lntorms Secretary Fish that
the French government receives iavovably
the proposition to conclude a telcgra^-nlc
convention between l*rance and the United States.
On tho -J3a or November Secretary Fish transmitted
to ail our Ministers abroad a letter, in which ho sayj I
the President desires to conclude a convention 011 I
the basis ol security or cable lines in time of peace
or war against wilful or wanton instruction or m
I jury by declaring that such acts shall be deemed
acis ol piracy and so punished; also to make suita
ble provisions to encourage tbe future construction
of ocean lines, and that hereafter no Exclusive cun
i cessions shall be made wltnout tuo Joint action ol
' the two governments whose shores are to be cou
| nected. The scrutiny of messages by government
officials in favor ol the Power controlling either end
of the cable is, in the opinion or the^ President, cal
culated to lead to trouble; therefore lie proposes to
have provision against it. The President desire* that
the representatives at Washington of Great Hntain
Franca, Portugal, Spain, Italy, North Germany,
Austria, P.ussta, Belgium, Holland, Sweden and
Norway, Denmark, Turkey, Greece, Venezuela. Bra
zil. Argentine Confederatian, Colombia, Bolivia,
.Peru, Ecuador, Mexico and Chile may be cm
powered to enter Jointly und severally into negotia
tions with tne tinted Stales and each other with a
view of concluding a Joint convention lor the pur
pose of establishing caiuc lines between the I'mtcd
States and those countries, it will be understood,
however, that this project Is submitted simply as a
busts lor future discussion snou'.d the leading
Powers concur with the United states in coa.- ler
ing the subject cue ior international cjujiactatioa
and jurisdiction.
Restricting lb.- Appellate Jurisdiction of the
(Supreme ("unit?A Swcijihw Change Pro*
So much in regard to the m.-saage; now aa to
other features of the senat# proceedings. From the
indications exhibited to-day It is evident that the
action of the Supreme Court In the Yerger case
will result 111 the abridgement of some of
tne powers it has heretofore enjoyed and
in the curtailing of its appellate jurisdiction. There
is a manliest distrust or the court upon tho part of
sevral prominent republicans in Cougresi, and an
it cannot very well be reconstructed or abolished
they think the next best thing to do is to curb it as
much as possible. Two bills were introduced in the
Senai'! to-lay for tins purpose, ono by surr'Oer and
another by Brake. Summer's bill, which la bci??ved
to have been Inspired If not urawn by the
Attorney General, simply takes aw*y iro n the
court its appellate jurisdiction in proceedings
commenced by h writ of hab'as corpus.
It appears tnat there is ? case expected to eomc up
la the Supreme Court at an early day somewhat
similar to the Yerger eae. This is the Immediate
object ot Mr. Sumner's bill, or rather, it is lutende l
to meet this i-jse, and he intends to urge speedy
a lion on It by ihe Committee on the Judiciary, to
whom the mil was referred. Drake's bill is of a
mole sweeping character, ai.d goes further thati
even such men as Sumner are deposed to go. Mr.
Brake's idea Is that, a-i the l ulled Mates inferior
c<>uits were created by congress*, they have no
power lo pa?i upon or or decide whether tho
laws enacted by tuat body are constitutional
or unconstitutional. They have no business,
he thinks, to have any opinions on that
subject, and his urn prohibits the (supreme Court
fr Mil enteriaiiiirift appeals fr<.m such inferior courts
Involving the validity or Congressional legislation.
Brake says bis bill strikes at the root of what he
deem* the unwaranted lu'erferem 0 ol the supreme
Court in matters pertaining ouly to the legislative
branch or tlie government, while Fnmuer's Is
merely inieiided to meet one of the niany cases
likely to bo brought before tbe eourt, if its present
jurisdiction Is leit undisturbed. it i? not thought
that the Judiciary Committee will report favorably
011 Brake's bill, because It Is regarded as an attempt
to break down tho Judiciary and to take away from
the Supremo Court all power to review the h< tion of
Congress. Drake is preparing a stron/ speech In
defence of his bill.
Heconalrartlon of (icor<jln.
It Is claimed that tho effect ol Senator Morton's
bill lor the reconstruction uf Georgia, if It becomes a
law, will secure tue ratification of the Fifteenth
amendment to the constitution of the United States;
and It is said that a careful count allows that the
vote of Georgia makes the requisite number. It is
the Intention of Mr. Morton to urge his bill next
Wednesday, when that reported by Senator
Edmunds last session will be taten up as a special
order.
Tbe New ('ennui BIU.
Asiegards the schedules contained In (i&rfleld's
1 new census bill 1 am Informed that whtlo ther will
not materially Increase tho labor of gathering sta
tistics they will contain one additional, under which
win be comprised?tlrst, tlie statistics of trade of
every store and mercantile establishment in the
United States; second, statistics respecting the rain

third, statistics giving a full exhibit of the internal
transportation of tho country, such as those by

therein, the number of passengers, rates of
transportation and total cost; fourth, statistics in
regard to the charitable and rctormatory institutions
of the country, as almshouses and hospitals, their
inmates and expense of supporting them, as well
as the amount of money Invested In such institu
tion*. These four branches were not, it is Raid, in
cluded uncjor any former census. The committee
have carefully revised ail the old schedules, drop
ping out tho slave schedule and enlarging the gen
eral scope of the others and malting them more

will be received with respect and careful considera

AddreM to the People of Liberia.
The National Executive Committee of Colored Men
of the i nlted States, through their chairman. Rev.
Belia Martin, have prepared an address to the

fliusn Opera Horst.?With a howling wintry

went up to the Grand Opera House last night la nu

Informed at the grand vestibule that "Owing
to tho incleuicticy of the weather the
flret performance oi Meyerbeer's grand opera in
English of 'Tho Huguenots' has boen postponed

this evening will admit you." But we were disap
pointed. We teached our destination to dud "The
Huguenots" in lull operation, although to a house
wim h in nutnoers was not calculated to awaken an
extraordinary degree of eniliustasm on the stage.
And yet the artists never acquitted themselves
more handsomely, and no audience was ever hotter
satisfied. Mr. Ualgh, as Hanoi; Mr. Drayton, us
Mari'el; Mr. Arnolu, as Uouut de Xcvers; Mr. H. CI
Fe&kes, as Count St. Itrla; Mrs. Drayton, as Marga

and Mr. Bernard aa Hols Kose, a good singer, entitled

Waixack'b Theatre.?Notwithstanding tne in
clemency of tue weather last night a large audience
assembled at Waliack's theatre to assist at tbe per
formance of Mrs. Centllvre'i charming live act
oomedy entitled "Tbe Wonder?a Woman Keeps a
Secret." Tbo greatost' wonder was tnat bo many
persons should bave ventured out of doors on such
a stormy night; but such of the venturesome?and
tbey formed quito a goodly number?as fouuu their
way Into the Wai iacklan temple of the drama weie
fully recompensed for wnatever inconveniences una
annoyauces they may have suflfcied iu reaching
there by tne admirable manner m which the piece
was presented and the enjoyable smoothness with
which H wuh enacted. The piece In question was
produced last night for the tlrsiutne tills season, and
was cast with ail the old favorites in their original
role*. Mr. Lester WallBck, who o&Bumed the part of
Don Felix, Infused into the character a vast ainouut
of that peculiar ease, dash and grace for which he
Ib so justly famous, and contributed in no small
decree to tne success or tne performance. Miss
Madeline Uenriques as Donna Vlolante made a very
clmrntlngrastiliiau belle, aud in action ami make-up
was all that could be desired. Mr. Gilbert as Don
Pedro, Mr. Hield as Don Lopez, Mr. Fisher as Colonel
Brltton, Mr. Kinggold as Don Frederic, Mr. Btoudart
as Uibby, and Mr. Williamson as Llaaaruo were all
up la their parts, and acted cbrouKiiuut with their
usual careiuluess. Mm. Laura Phillips sustained
the part of Donna Isabella In a very creditable
manner, and Miss Eftle Germon and Miss Fanny
Greene, as the maids Flora and Inez respectively,
were exeeeuiualy coquettish, and did run justice to
tho parts entrusted to them. Upon the whole "The
Wonder" as presented at tins house last evening
was a most enjoyable performance, aud will ba
repeated again on Friday evening.
Kiblo's Garden.?Lotta appeared in two pieces
last night and charmed her audience In both. I?
"The Little Detective," a piece arranged expressly
for her, she snstaiaod six different characters. Ilcr
versatility 1# only equalled by the rich flow qI
humor which runs through all her characters. A*
the Little Detective she sustained the reputation long
sinoe accorded to her. The grace witu which she
ever answers the encore 01 an audience, cveu when
wearied and fatljruod, mates her a fuvorite with ail
and deserves acknowledgment. Lotta introduced
a new llgure in an lilsh jig last night aud
made a "break down" of It, much to the merriment
of all present. Together with "The Little Detec
tive," the roaring faroe of "An Object of Interest"
wus given, thus reviving old times, when, no matter
what the attraction lu the early part of the evening,
a good rollicking farce brought the night's enter
tainment to a close. Lotta played fanny Grebbioa
in the farce, and gave a banjo solo, which was called
tor three times. Mr. Vincent played in both pieces,
and was very happy in his efforts. Mr. Bradley, in
tbe first piece, gave a good rendition of the charac
ter of a London detective, and Miss Kate Newton, as
she always does, played well.
Theatre Francais A reconstructed version of
the panoramic drama of "London" was produced
at this house last night. The reconstruction hatt
benefited the piece greatly, and renders it quite
eujoyable and interesting. The scenery and inci
dents present constant variety, like the changes of a
kaleidoscope, and It is likely that in its present
form "Loudon" will have a renewed Jeaae of uio
lor some time to come. The scene 01 London
bridge looked exceedingly real, aud the Tower,
with its world of associations, rising in grim gran
deur above the turbid waters of the Thames, filled
the audience with admiration of the fidelity, as
niuoii as the Btriklng boldness of the scenic repre
sentation. Mrs. Clara Jeuumgs, Mr. Lewis baiter
and Mr. F. C. Bangs played their pans cornmenda
biy, and were well supported by the rest of the
company.
Fifth Avenue Theatre.?To see that mncmlflcent
comedy, ;'Wives as They Were, Maids as They Are,"
which has not been played in this city for thirty years,
a very good audience was last evening, notwith
standing the severe storm, assembled at this bouse.
The comedy was^ell put on the stage and played
with spirit. A monotonous feature was no change of
scene ror three acts, and, as usual, there was too
much time between the acts, causing the customary
weariness aud impatience to the audience. Iu
other regards the play passed off admirably.
Messrs. Davenport. Davidge and Harkius were all
happy In their parrs, and so were Mrs. Chanirau,
Misa Ethel aud Miss Davenport. Tho striving ana
most admirable feature or the performance was Mr.
Holland as Oliver, originally played by him at Drury
Lane forty years ago. He was splendid?as good as
ho ever could have been in his palmiest days, me
Blay will be continued tills evening, to-morrow even
lg and at Barurday matluue.
Olympic Theatre.?Last night was presented at
this theatre a reconstructed version of "Under tbe
Gaslight." The revision wnlch this well'known
piece has undergone consists merely of the intro
duction of slight and mildly Jocular allusions to
later incidents in the soclul, political aud ilnanctal
World. It Is well put upon the stage, tho pier scene
and the railway depot being particularly flue. Of the
manner of its representation It is less easy to speak.
A very stormy as well as a first night was unfavorable
alike for actors and for spectators. The latter wero
not numerous enough to communicate any special in
spiration to the former. The cast comprised three
of the original cast or the piece, viz:?J. K. Mortimer
ns snorkev, J. It. Studley as liyke and C. T. I'arsloe,
Jr., as Bermudas. Tho merits of these gentlemen aro
well known ann call for no new comment. Of the
new taleut may be mentioned as most pleasing,
without exciting extraordinary admiration, Miss Lilly
Vlnlng as Pearl Courtland. Miss Florence Noble as
Mrs. Van Daui and Miss Ida Vernon as Laura Court
land. Theso achieved such success as wo liava
mentioned m about the order in which they are
named, but beyond any of them was Miss Marie
Longmore (reach Blossom). A vaulting leap which
this young lady mad" over a table was the leature
of the evening, not even excepting the great rail
road scene.
New York Theatre.?Last evening was the open
ing night at this theatre of the new French com
pany, association of artists. Notwithstanding the
terrible storm the house was well filled, and in the
enl yment of the very extraordinary programme
outdoor discomforts were speedily forgotten. The
vaudeville In one act of "Mile. Hcrlrand and Mile.
Ifaton," the comedy of "Les Jurons do Cadillac,"
and the opera bwijfl) In ono actol "Maltre rntlielin,"
wero presented by an excellent company, including
several favorites of former seasons. "Les Jorone
de Cadillac" was received with particular favor, and
the entire company gavo promise of a week of capi
tal entertainment.
