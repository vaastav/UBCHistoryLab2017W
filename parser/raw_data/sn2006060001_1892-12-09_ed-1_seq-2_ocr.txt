A r.rwr to Local Option,
The recent election on the local op
tion qucs'tiouu liiaUotcouuty hasITeen
declared illegal by the bupreme court.
A mandamus was usked for by Dennis
T. Covert to compel the county treas
urer of tiratiot county to accept from
the relator his approved bond and S?jOO
for a liquor tax, and to give him a re
ceipt therefor to post up in his place of
business, as provided by act No. 313 of
the session laws of 1887. This the
couuty treasurer had refused to do, as
he claimed that act No. 20(1 of the ses
sion laws of 18S'., commonly known, as
the local option law, was in force in
the county.
The supreme 'court decision quotes
section 0 of the local option act,' which
provides that where the board oi su
pervisors shall determine that a sutli
cent number of electors have petitioned
for an election that tho board shall tso
declare, and shall then make an order
calling the election, and that such or
der shall be entered in full upon the
journal of the proceedings of the board
for that day, and shall be signed by
the acting chairman and clerk of tho
board before final adjournment.
Subsequent sections of the act
also require that tho inspectors
of election, without recess or
adjournment, shall draw up a state
ment of tho result of the vote and cer
tify to its correctness and subscribe
their names thereto. "It is clear,"
pays the opinion granting tho manda
mus, "that these provisions are manda
tory, anc1 that they were enacted for
the protection of both puldic interests
nnd private rights. In the case at bar
It is conceded that the statute referred
to has not been complied with." Tho
court therefore declared that tho un
authentieated proceedings of the board
of supervisors could not be held as a
record and therefore granted a man
damus. Humeri Her Husband's Home.
For some time George Topp nnd his
wife, of Lansing, have been having
trouble, and a short time ago they di
vided their property and separated.
Mr. Topp a short time ufter bought a
farm about three miles out from the
capital and the former owner vacated
it the first of last week and Mr. Topp
moved his vegetables in tho cellar.
Two days later the house burned to
tho ground with a loss of abut 000,
with no insurance. Suspicion rested
upon Mrs. Topp and the ofllcers have
been working on the case until they
arrested her. Then she confessed that
6he burned it. She was sent to Ionia.
Improved Highway Commissioner Report
Tho highway commission appointed
by Uov. Winans to recommend to the
incoming legislature some plan for im
proving the highways of the state and

Tho document, wh'ioh' is ' somewhat
voluminous, recommends radical
changes in existing laws on tho sub
ject. It will not bo given to the public
until Gov. Winans transmits it to the
legislature with his. retiring message.

Co nit reus May Change Its Date.
There is a well-defined movement on
foot in influential circles to change the
date of convening each new Congress
from December to March immediately
following the inauguration of tho new
president. Among the numerous ad
vantages of such a move will be noted
the following:
It would enable the dominant party
in Congress to respond promptly to the
will of its constituents and to act upon
important issues while they are yet
alive.
It would avoid all occasion for
agitation or wrangling over the ques
tion of early extra sessions.
It would put Congress in direct and
immediate communication with tho
newly inaugurated President.
It vould make practicable tho
transaction of much important busi
ness in advance of the summer recess
and give greater assurance of timely
and stable legislation than can bo pre
dicted or depended on under the
present anomalous and uncertain
system.

TO PROHIBIT IMMIGRATION.
Senate Committee on Immigration Kec
ommends New Lairs.
The senate coinmitteo on immigra
tion met in New York City with but
s'x of its members in attandanee. The
coinmitteo considered the following
proposition without, however, reached
any conclusion: "All immigration,
except from tho North and South
American countries, shall be suspended
J for one year from March 1, 18J3, tha
law to bo so framed as not to hinder
'tho free return of American citi
zens or the easj' admission of visitors."
i Various suggestions fur legislation
for the restriction of immigration had
.,,iiu,i i. !...,.. -
been submitted by the chairman for the
4! :,4 ,,,,
it was decided not to take up before
the meeting of congress, but it was
determined, in view of the greatly ap
prehended danger of tho coming of
cholera during tho summer of 1803, to
limit the present consideration of the
subject to the question of total suspen
sion of immigration for the year.
The committee also decided that it
was advisablo to submit to congress for
consideration a law embracing the fol
lowing propositions:
"1. No immigrant shall be admitted
to tho United States between to ages
' of 12 and 55 years unless he can read

An Ameriean Pope.
A special from Baltimore Rays: Tho
announcement made that Mgr. Satolli
had been appointed by the pope with
full power to settle without appeal all
religious questions between bishops
and priests in tho United States has
caused considerable, excitement in
Catholic circles. Tho announcement
was made by Cardinal Gibbons. An
effort to interview him on tho subject
was unavailing, the only thing gleaned
from him being a confirmation of the
report.
t The announcement will cause a sen
sation in Catholic circles throughout
the United States. Why Cardinal Gib
bons should bo overlooked and such
plenary powers be given to one directly
from tho Vatican, is only one among
tho many perplexing questions asked
about it. It had been rumored, in
deed, that, Mgr. Satolli, in addition to
the reasons above named, had been
sent to America on a secret mission as
a representative -of tho pope, but nono
had conjectured that he would bo in
trusted with such autocratic power as
would practically make him the pope
of America.

rotmater-jencral Submit Iteports to the
'rklunt- J ml lun and Military IMucu
tion Fo.ttofllccs, i:tc.
The annual report of Secretary
Noble, of tho interior department,
shows that the volume of work accom
plished during the present administra
tion greatly exceeds that of any like
preceding period in the history of tho
department, lu the general land office
on June 30, 18h3, there were pending
d50,'J5J final entries, and tho accumla
tion is steadily increasing. These
have all been disposed of. During tho
present administration 3!iS,128 agricul
tural patents have been issued, against
102,754 in the preceding four years,
representing an excess in ucrcago of
J, 050,840 acres.
Educational work among tho Indians
has been greatly increased and im
proved in t'liicieney. There has been
an increase of over 13 per cent in at
tendance of children in tho schools,
the total for 1S'J2 being 10,703 scholars.
Under the policy of Indian allotments,
negotiations with 14 tribes during tho
present administration ias resulted in
the opening up for public settlement
of nearly 2G.000.000 acres of land.
Other negotiations which aro pending
will, when ratified, add 10,000,000 acres
more.
The work on the 11th census is
almost complete. Tho farm mortgage
report will occupy 12 months longer.
The number of applications for patents
during the year was 45,1)15; tho total
number awaiting action July 1, 18U2,
0,447. The number of patents granted
was 2d,G20, the total receipts were
S1,2CS,724.35, and the expenditures
&1, 114, 131.23. The amount in the
treasury to tho credit of tho patent
office is now 1,102,441.09.
It has been determined bv triangula-
tion that tho summit of Mt. St. Elias
has an altitude of 18,100 feet above the
sea, making it the highest point on tho
continent, unless certain unmeasured
volcanoes of excess should prove to be
higher.
l'ostolllce Department.
The postmaster-general mentions nt
tho beginning of his annual report the
chief developments . of the year as fol
lows: "Five million dollars added to
the gross revenue; the deficit reduced
nearly Jl, 000,000. Money order offices
increased two-thirds, or from 10,070 to
10,080. Eighty-two cities supplied
with free delivery. Twenty-seven
hundred and ninety new offices estab
lished. Two hundred and sixty-three
offices advanced to the presidential
grade. Sixteen and three-fourths
millions of miles of additional serxice.
Fifteen hundred and ninety new mail
routes established, embracing 8,500
miles of new service. Ocean mail
servico extended; and pneumatie
tube service introduced. It appears
that in tho last four years 5,051 new
mail routes have been established.
traversing 20.000 miles; that tho num
ber of post offices has grown by over
8,000, the number of money order ofiices
over 8,200 and the number of free de
livery offices has almost doubled
Free delivery ought to be extended fur
ther and further whether it pays a
firofit to the department or not. I be
iovc fully that great advantages could
be made in tho direction of free deliv
ery by an evolution of tho star route
service."
In the matter of collection of mail
from letter boxes at house doors, the
division of the country into postal dis
tricts, tho pneumatic tube, the postal
telegraph and postal telephone and one
cent letter postage are strenuously ad
vocated. All postmasters, presidential
and fourth class, nnd all employes in
all branches of the department should
have a specific term of four years on
good behavior. He would establish a
system of compensation for railroads
based upon speed a J0, 30, 40, 50 and
CO mile an hour rate.
Recretary Elklns' ICeport.
Secretary of War Elkins in his
annual report recommends the re
organization of the infantry and the
artillery and the revival of the grade
of lieutenant-general. The personnel
of the army, he thinks, is improving.
The troops are stationed in 90 posts, of
which three are in Michigan and 33
east of the Mississippi river. The
abandonment of small posts and the
concentration of troops near large com
mercial centers the secretary regards
as advisable.
An appropriation of at least
$1,000,000 for tho National Guard is
recommended. It is also recommended
that the present law be so changed
that arms and supplies which have be

JAY GOULD 13 DEAD.
The Great Financier iiikI Kuilicail Muj;
nlle Itreatheii ills I.ait.
Famous Jay Gould has passed to the
great unknown. The causu of death
was pulmonary consumption, from
which he had been suffering for some
months.
The Hoeno at the house In New York
City at the lust was not extraordinary.
His children were at his bedside, und
they reccgnized their hopes had van
ished, but they continued their vigil
which only ceased when .tho
last . breath left tho body.
Dr. Miinn, his physician, had Dr. Jane
way in consultation, but they said
nothing could be done but uiako Mr.
Gould's last hours as comfortable as
possible. When tho end camo tho
members of the family who were in tho
house were: Mr. and Mrs. George J.
Gould, Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Gould,
Miss Helen Gould, Howard Gould, Har
old Gould and Miss Annie Gould.
The history of Jay Gould from the
barefooted boy who wandered over tho
rough hills of Delaware county to tho
railroad king, whose wealth was esti
mated ut 00,000,000, is one of tho most
remarkable of our self-made men.
Mr. Gould was born in West Settle
ment, a backwoods village of lloxbury,
Delaware county, N. Y., May 27, 1S31.
He was the son of John 1. Gould, a
farmer, who was fairly well-to-do and
who had been a deputy sherilf in the
famous anti-rent war in the early '30s.
His mother died when ho was an infant.
Gould left homo with 50 cents in his
pocket and took a courso of study in
Hobart academy in a neighboring town
paying his way by keeping books, etc.
On leaving school he made surveys for
a map of Ulster county, N. Y., for 20
per month. He made a reputation
through this and in a short time had
saved a neat sum from this work.
A tannery was his next successful vent
ure and young Gould then went into
the wholesale leather business in New
York. His father-in-law sold him a
number of shares in tho Rutland &
Washington railroad at 10 cents on tho
dollar. Gould showed such interest in
the road that he was mado its president
and general manager. This was the
beginuing of his railroad financiering
which carried him to tho high llood of
fortune.
Jlurned the Italian Flag,
For several weeks a number of Ital
ians working on a railroad in the back
woods of St. Lawrence county, N. Y.,
have had lloating over their huts an
Italian Hag. The miners who live in
the neighborhood demanded that tho
ilag bo hauled down or un American
Hag raised over it. The Italians re
fused and the miners fired on tho flag
and drove tho Italians into their
shanties. The flag was hauled down
and burned by the miners. The Ital
ians then opened tiro on the miners
with shotguns and pistols. They re
plied and riddled the shanties with
shot. No serious injuries resulted.
Great excitement prevails and another
encounter is expected. Two of tho
riotous miners have been arrested, lho
attention of the Italian minister at
Washington will bo called to tho
matter.
