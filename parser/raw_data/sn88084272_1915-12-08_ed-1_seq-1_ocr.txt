Dallas and Chicago Lose Out
in Contest, Despite Dallas
Mayor's Earnest Plea.
Washington. D. C Dec. 8 Despite a
stirring appeal by the mayor of Dallas
that the 1916 Democratic national con
vention be held in the Texas city, the
convention goes to St. Louis. It will be
gin Wednesday, June 16. at noon. Aside
from fixing the time and place for the
convention, the Democratic national
comlttee Tuesday night adopted resolu
tions favorintr the renomination and
.reelection of Woodrow Wilson as presi
dent, ,
Chicago and Dallas contested with St.
Louis for the honor of the convention,
but St. Louis easily led from the start,
and won on the second ballot, when the
trend of the voting was seen. Texas
moved that the choice of St- Louis be
made unanimous. Dallas held second
place on the first ballot, but was dis
placed by Chicago on the second roll
calL
The result of the first ballot was: St
Louis. 25: Dallas, 14; Chicago. 13. On
the second ballot, the vote was St Louis,
28: Chicago. 15. and Dallas, 9. The ma
jority for St Louis was gained on this
ballot When John T. McGraw arose near
the end of the call and changed West
Virginia's vote from Chicago to the
Missouri city. Then the choice was
made unanimous.
Chicago for Republicans.
Political leaders in Washington to
night regarded it as practically certain
that Chicago will be selected for the
Republican convention when the na
tional committee of that party meets
next Tuesday. The date for this con
vention probably will be late in June.
Each of the three cities contesting for
the Democratic convention put in a bid

The advocates of St Louis supple
mented their financial indueemeits by
a warning t the committee thtt the
convention was needed in Mijsoari to
keep the 18 electroal voes of that state
in the Democratic column. The delega
tion from Dallas pleaded with the com
mittee to award the loyad Democracy
of the south, ly sending the convention
next year to a southern state The Texas
speakers were rreeted with eithuslzstlc
cheers by the n embers of tleir delega

interrupted the proceedings. Chicago
based its appeal largely on its climate
and its inown ability !o tike care of

first of the Texas felegation to be
heard.
"Gentlemen." he nifl. "We don't have

Increases in the collection force, a
requirement that returns must be made
of gross income In place of net in

shall not be withheld at the source,
were among Mr. McAdoo's other sug
gestions. He made no estimate of the
number of persons who might be taxed
