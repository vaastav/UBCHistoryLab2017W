The President'. Message (aod accomfe.
In j documents) to the Thirty-eighth Congress
hai given to the whole country a feeling of
aautraeuon and an Increased confldence In the
epcedy rettoratlon of Ibe Union upon a aonnder
and more enduring bails than before the war.
The statement presented of the condition of
our public affaire, foreign and doiacatlc, It a
gramying one.
The tone of the President and Mi Cabinet
ministers It calm, dignified, and reliant. There
u no naiung or wavering. There It no pcrtur
biatlon. No mere ezpcdlenu are proposed for
getting out of dllcmms. Thero It no taming
back, no abandonment of policy but we hare a
steady movement forward. The emancipation
proclamation, to far from being tct atlde It to
bo the tut for those who would return to their
allegiance. The traltorout elaveholdcr limit
twear by It to prove hit fialty to the Govern
ment agalnit which he had rebelled for the
take of slavery.
At In the general policy of the Prctldent to
wardt the rebellion! district, so In the particu
lar plant of each minister In bit department,
thero It no retrogression. That which vat
created by the last Congress Lit been found
rood In principle, and nothing It recommended
advorse, nothing proposed but modifications
necessary to perfect the detail! of the dlflercnt
rtteme.
Our financial plants pronouneed good by
me jimi.ier oi nneoce. We have a currency
sufficient In volume, created by Congress since
tne war organ, that lias worked wouden. A
nation cannot eilst without a currency, any
more than a human being could live wit,
out a mucou! membrane, and Congress hai
mado one which perform! ita office with
Ual facility all ver th. country, which
on It! face demand! allegiance of every man
who recelics It and blndi lilm oter not

The mighty energies jut forth by the Gov
ernment and people In the equipment of our
Immense armlas, and the building ofa poncr

cannot fall to luiumuml lho admiration
and respcel of nur ujtloni. Vtmn we
had been robbed ol arms, arsenals and naty
yards, an J bound like aampsou ilh green

and we are able to arm ourscltcs without the

after enumeratlug the quantities of cannon
and small armt provided within the last year,
says that our resources for adding to this lui.
meose store have only commenced their devel

during the coming year and that not only the
treason but its cause will be removed, never

General Butler has commenced lho work

The administration of It will bo continued

At much that It not true hat been pnblithed
concerning the doing! of the "Natiohal
Coi-xcil" of tho Loyal Leagues of the United
Stales, at their session in this city lell week,
we tako thlt opportunity to state that an at
tempt being made In tbe Council to commit Iu
members to a policy, the tendency of which
wat to cmbarrast tho Admtnittratlon of Mr.
Lincoln, a committee consisting of Hon. Geo.
8. Boutwtll, M. C Hon. John Covode, Er-M.
C, and Hon. Mr. Ashley, M. (J.,wat appointed
to wait upon Ihe Prctldent anl convene with
him gencrallt on national afTalra, and es
peclally with referevce to affairs In Missouri,
Tho committed attended to the duty aaalgntd
them. They were rospcctrully and kindly ro-
cehed by tho President. The Interview was
Interesting and satisfactory to both parties.
There was no demands made of the Prctldent
by the commtttec, nor yielding of principles or
policy by tbe latter. A perfect understanding
wat reached at to the wishes of the one end
the purposes of the other.
The committee made a report to the Council
of such a tatlsfactory character at to oante the
most generou! and harmonious endorsement of
the President and his policy, ai announced In
his lste message.
The Missouri members of Congress were
Initiated, and au expression of opinion wat
made by the Council, that whllo tho President
had perhaps not punned such a count towarda
Misssourl as was satisfactory to the most
radical portion of the pcoplo of that 8tala,!ic
had dono w hat teemed to htm at the time to
be right and Just In lew of all tho iaets before

The action, of tho Council wat harmonious
and dignified, and the Leagues of tlie several
