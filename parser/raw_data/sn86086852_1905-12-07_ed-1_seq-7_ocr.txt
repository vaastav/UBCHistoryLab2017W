Governor Announces
Acceptance of
Senatorship
Tells Legislature He
Will Resign Before
Session Closes
But Will Ever Fight
in the Politics of
Wisconsin
As soon as he can pack his capacious
trunk, settle a few details ot executive
work including Ihe decision of the Kit
tell case from Green Bay,, place Hie
governor's office in apple pie order ami
possibly hang a picture of King Hank
on VII on the spot where will fall the
gaze of the gubernatorial eye of h s
worthy Norwegian successor, —and,
perhaps, sign a few of the bills sug
gested in his voluminous message,
Governor La Follette will bo ready to
acquire the right to draw federal mile
age from Wisconsin so Washington,
and as a bride led to the alter (maybe)
walk with bashful blushes up the cen
ter aisle of the Untied States senate,
leaning (?) on the arm of bis cot
league, John C. Spooner.
Into such a sentence might be
jumbled the mass of speculation and
gossip that followed the reading of the
governor's message io the specially
convened legislature yesterday, closing
with the supplementary message an
nouncing, frankly and without qunlltl
cation, the determination of the excel’
live to resign the governorship to
Lieutenant Governor Davidson and "ac
cept Hie high commission ' of the Unit
ed States senatorship. Upon lli"
whole the message was listened to with
thoughful roceptivencss on the pari ot
the senators and assemblymen, but
the senatorship declara'ion was nmi
with a burst of applause that came as
a climax to the approving clappings
that punctuated the main address. A
correspondent of stalwart factional in
clinations remarked to a member Sia 1 -
vvart only in physical proportions;
"The way you pound your palms at
that, you must be glad he’s going re
leave the state.”
Then came the governor’s closing
sentence, declaring that he would
“continue active personal partici
pation in every contest involving the
principles of representative govern
ment in this commonwealth; no office
and no honors could tempt me to fore
go the riglil to work aggressively in
this field, where the best of my life has
been spi nt and where 1 shall ever fee!
that my first and last obligation
rests.”
Everybody wandered how soon the
governor would resign,—and everybody
seemed to know “all the time that lie
would never give up the senatorship.
Some critics who assume to know an
about things political declared that u
was possible that’ friends of the gov
ernor bad impressed him with Hie
thought that he ought not longer io
keep the people of the state in doub*
<-f the ei mmonwealth on half represen
lation in the federal senate, "however
able may be the other half of the rep
resentation.” It seems tolerably cer
tain that, the supplementary message
v;.s prepared at a late hour; whether
by accident or because the governor’s
mind was not made up until late is not
generally known and is unimportant
even though it might be interesting.
Unqualified Acceptance.
The separate message, concerning
the senatorship is as follows:
"To the senate and assembly in
joint sessions: Upon the 25th day of
January last, you elected me to repre
sent Wisconsin as United States sen
ator. I was then, and while I live
shall continue to be, profoundly grate
ful for the great honor which you con
ferred upon me. But certain fixed ob
ligations bound me to continue as
governor. Laws involving millions of
dollars were being challenged in the
courts, legislation vital to the state
was pending. I could not, in good
conscience, offer more than a quali
fied acceptance.
"The close of the session found the
litigation undecided, the new laws ur
tried. Adverse decisions in the cir
cuit court might call promptly for
curative legislation The administra
tion of the new laws might disclose
defects requiring Immediate remedy.
The railway interests and those rep
resenting them were not only ob
structing the collection of taxes, but
seeking to discredit the new legisla
tion. Every reason made it a plain
duty to await the circuit court deci
sions, and the testing of the new laws
in their administration.
"Time has entirely justified this
course. The attitude of the railway

ment of taxes as soon as made, and
withholding from the state the pay
ment of their taxes under the new law.
the construction which provisions of
this law seems to demand, the
amendments to the primary election
law. and other Important matters this
day submitted for your consideration,
are all required to round out the work
of the last, and preceding sessions
of the legislature in advancing this
great reform movement.
“I may be pardoned if 1 take this
opportunity to emphasize one great
truth, with which I am so deeply im
pressed. The contest for representa
tive government in Wisconsin is not
ended. To protect and preserve all
that has been gained by this protract
ed struggle will require the combined
efforts of the greatest wisdom, and
the continued vigilance of the patriot
ic citizenship of the state.
“We have another and added re
sponsibility. The influence of Wiscon
sin is felt in every state in the union.
We cannot halt or turn back without
bringing disaster to our own state,
and discouraging all progress along
these lines in other states. To Wis
consin belongs the high privilege, the
grave responsibility of proving to sis
ter states and to the nation that the
policies adopted and the principles en
acted into law, are not transitory, but
are wrought into the very foundations
of our government, and are not to be
destroyed.
"During the special session, or at
least at its close, 1 shall transmit to
you my resignation as governor of
the state and accept your high com
mission as United Slates senator. 1
shall regard it as my privilege and
duty to continue active personel par
ticipation in every contest involving
the principles of representative gov
ernment In this commonwealth. No
office and no honors could tempt me
to forego the right to work aggressive
h- in this field, where the best of my
life has been spent, and where 1 shall
ever feel that my first and last obli
gation rests.”
Assembly Chamber Crowded.
The assembly chamber was so
crowded witn eager spectators long
before the governor commenced to
deliver his message that the doors
had to be guarded by policemen
against any more peop.e coining in.
This was necessary on account of the
large number that sought attendance
and also because it was feared that
an excessively crowded chamber
might ho dangerous by reason of tin
possibility of the floor giving way.'
The assembly chamber broke into a
roar of applause as the governor and
party made their way in and up to
the speaker's platform. Lieutenant
Governor Davidson, Speaker 1 .enroot
and President pro tempore McGllliv
lay occupied the rostrum with the
governor. The message was now lo
(he audience and the closest attention
war, paid, the reading being frequent
ly interrupted by signs of approval.
Particularly vociferous was the re
ceplion of the frank avowal of the
governor’s determination to resign
the executive position and go to the
United Stales senate. The message,
having been prepared all within Hu
last four days, was read by the gov
ernor with close attention to the
printed copy and there was little of
the oratorical in its delivery. Force
ful and strong with the earnestness of
deep conviction and sincerity was tin
reading and the reception was appar
ently that of earnest desire lo he in
formed of what the governor had to
present, rather than of any great ex
nherance.
Little Routine Business.
The business of the legislature yes
terday, aside from hearing the mes
sages of the governor, consisted mere
ly In adopting resolutions providing
for the force of assistants to the chief
clerks and sergeant-at-arms. Reso
lutions also required the superintend
cut of public property to supply the
members with the session laws and
journals of the two houses fer the
last regular session. None of the ap
pointing officers have selected their
entire forces, although the patronage
is reduced to the i most minimum
possible consistent with effective help
for legislation.
