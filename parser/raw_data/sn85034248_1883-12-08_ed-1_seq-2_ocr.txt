A kitchen building belonging to Auguste
Degas, at College Point, was destroyed by
fire Monday night of last week. The Creole
FLresde reports that the fire was caused
by a lighted cigarette imprudently thrown
into a trash box.
Mr. Ed. N. Bertheand, the former first
baseman of the old Burnside Base Ball
Club of this place, who has been in Texas
for some months past earning new laurels
on theldiamond field, unexpectedly dropped
in on us this morning, having just returned
to St. James from his trip to the Lone Star
State. Ed. is looking finely and speaks in
high terms of ouseton pd' Texas generally.
Miss Clara Keating has returned from
her visit to Baton Rouge after a most en.
Joyable sojourn in that pleasant little city,
and is warmly welcomed home by her rel
atives and friends. From the Weekly
Tuth we copy the following compliment
ary "personal: "
Miss Clara Keating, alovely and accomplished
young lady, of Donaldsonville, who has been
visiting the Misses McGrath, of this oity, for
the last three eeks, returned to her home on
last Buday. The young lady was much ap.
pleeoiated by a large number of newly made
friends and admihers, who iregAtted exceeding
ly her departure, and were only coesoled by the
promise of another visit from her shortly.
The family of Capt, C. P. Truslow of the
Red River and Coast Line made a round
trip on the Jesse K. Bell recently, just be
fore that steamer was transferred from the
New Orleans and Plaquemine trade back to
Red river. The party consisted of the Cap
tain's wife, Mrs. Q. P. P. Tlow, his daugh
ters, Mine Cora and Annabel Truslow, his
stepdaughter, Miss Edna Perrin, and two
lady friends of the family, Mrs. Tarrant and
Miss Aim6e Tarrant. The ladies appeared
to derive much enjoyment from their ex
cursion.
We were misinformed, it seems, concern
ing the nature of the indisposition from
which Mr. Henry C. Wilson, manager of
the Palo Alto plantation, is suffering. We
had understood that he waQ prostrated by
the effects of a severe cold, but we have
more recently learned that he slipped and
fell in the sugar-house, wrenching his
thigh so seriously that he has been confined
to the house and. can only walk with the
aid of ortiiehes. He ventfired outlastMon
day soonier than he should have done, and
the indiscretion has somewhat retarded his
recovery.
The Terpsichorean Social Club will begin
preparations next week for the grand fancy
dares ball to be given by that organization
on the 8th of January. The affair promises,
to be one of exceptional brilliance, as we
hear there will be adisplay of fine costumes
by some of the young men as well as the
ladies, a number of the former proposing
to rig themselves up in:;the ;style of our
grandfather's days and personate great
men,of ye olden time. Every ticket will
have a numbered coupon attached entitling
the holder to a chance in the raffle of a val
nable gift that will take place during the
ball. The arrangements will be all that can
be desired for such an affair.
Cosonlss.-The Forty-eighth Congress
assembled at Washington I:la' Monday in
regular session. Mr. Carlisle, the nominee
of the Democratic caucus, was elected
Speaker, the Republican members casting
their votes for ex-Speaker Keifer. The re
organization of the Senate has not yet ta
ken place and no date therefor has been
fixed upon. The President's message was
received and read and a number of bills
have been introduced, being mostly meas
ures of a private character. The message
contains little worthy of special note, the
satisfactory condition of the country not
affording material for any thing startling
or novel is the executive communication.
Several matters will be made the subjects
of special messages, among them the im
provement of the Mississippi river.
LoDno NOTES.-At next Tuesday's meet
ing of Lee Lodge, A. O. U. W., officers for
the ensuing term will be nominated and the
merits of a new goat tested. The presence
of every member is desired. The officers
nominated next Tuesday will be formally
elected at the last meeting in December and
installed at the first meeting in January. 3
As the fourth Tuesday of this month will
be Christmas day, the lodge has applied for
permission to change the date of the second
December meeting.
The Knights of Honor and Knights of
Pythias also elect otlicers this month, the
former on the third Tuesday and the latter
on the last Thursday.
Two candidates were initiated in the rank
of Page at the meeting of Kenneth Lodge, I
K. of P., this week.
Ascension Council No. 816, American
Legion of Honor, meets to-night.
Eddie Butler and Frank Thomas, two t
young colored men, had a quarrel at Blue
Bucket Exchange, the evening of Nov.
10, with a man of their own color, a re- t
cent comer here, and meeting him at the
Market-House later in the evening they set
upon him and beat him viciously with a
s'icks, bruising him about the head and t
face quite severely. Thomas succeeded in
escaping arrest and got out of town, but s
Eddie was not so lucky, and now lies in the b
parish jail unable to furnish a bond of $200 u
for the assault and battery and $100*r the -
additional offense of carrying concealed a
weapons. He tried to get away and very
nearly succeeded, boarding a bayou boat at R
the wharf and going as far as the railroad ti
bridgee, where an officer went aboard and a
captured him. Eddie has been involved in w
several sqluabbles and has shown rather I bi
too great a readiness to use his club. Nu I
doubt hIs present trouble will have a ten- i
dieney to make lhi moie discreet in that I u
HOW IT STANDS.
According to the New Orleans Picayune
the net result cf the elections for delegates
to the J)emocratie State convention held up
to this dale is, McEnery 96, anti-admipis
tration 85, and in the parishes to be heard
from, exclusive of New Orleans, the Pie.
counts upon securing 104 anti-administra
tion votes, against 17 for MeEnery. This
would make the total vote 11ii for the ad
ministration and 189 against It, Lafayette
and Winn being omitted from the calcula
tion "for good reasons." This, with a
claimed majority of the Orleans dalegation,
the anti-administrationists will have a clear
majority and control the convention easily.
The Tinmes.Deimocrat, on the other hand,
figures the situation thus: McEnery votes
conceded by the opposition, 113; claimed
by T.-D., 97; estimated from New Orleans,
60; total for McEnery 270.
It may be supposed that the T.-D. has the
magnanimity to concede the remaining
129 votes to the anti-administrationists, but
not so: it assumes to think that some
twenty-five or thirty of the little balance
may still be gathered in by the greedy
MoEneryites.
Thus it stands. If the readers of the
CaHEF do not comprehend the situation
clearly it is not our fault.
FRENOH OLAIMS DEOISIONS,.

MUNIOIPAL MATTERSBB.
The Town Council held its monthly meet
ing last Tuesday and transacted important
business, as will appear from the official
proceedings published in another column.
The wharf has been accepted from the late
lessee, although it is claimed the structure
does not correspond with the plan and
specifications under which it was built. In
consideration of the cession of the ware
house and little office which were the pri
vate property of the ex-lessee, the Council
agreed to waive the discrepancy between
the wharf and the specifications, Alderman
Israel opposing the project. Town licenses
for 1884 were fixed at one-half the amounts
of State licenses; the lease of batture lots
on Lafourche street was confirmed; the
wharf lessee was authorized to stabblish a
lugger landing on the bayou between At
takapas and Opelousas streets and to re
move obstructions therefrom; an ordinance
prohibiting the explosion of firecrakers,
sky-rockets and other fireworks within the
corporate limits, excepting on the public
squate and the batture, was passed; a com
mitte to revise the market ordinances was
appointed and several matters of minor
importance were considered.
OUR NEW ORLEANS LETTER.
The Treasury Imbroglio-Covering Mel
posmene Canal--The Projected Port nads
Railway - Freight Handlers' Strike
Brother John ouends the Yewgsg for
Brother Sam.
NEW OaBLAss, November 30, 1883.
DITon Cmair:
The Supreme Court has so far modified
matters in the Treasury imbroglio, that
the Mayor's appointee," Chief Clerk A. P.
Harrison, is now passing the cash over the
counter, and Mr. Walsh is awaiting an at
tempt to impeach himself, which interest
ing event is announced' to take place next
week. On receipt of the court order, Mr.
Walsh promptly notified the Mayor and
Council of his readiness to obey, and he
subsequently appeared before that august
body to correct the impression that in the
discharge of his dutioes under his oath, as
he understood them, he had in any manner
intended any personal reflection upon his
colleagues. But it was of no use, and was
not oil on the troubled sense of dignity of
Mr. Booth, who was resolved to fit the im
peachment hat on Mr. Walsh or blast him
self in the oratorical attempt.
Meanwhile, it should be known through
out all the land the corporation is covering
Melpomene canal. Billy Emerson, a Negro
minstrel of auld lang syne, began one of
his uproarious orations by a reference to
this canal: " Fellow citizens, when Chris
topher Columbus discovered the Melpom
ane canal," etc. The oldest inhabitant ,
snd every visitor since his domicile has c
wondered how it was that a modern city
bould endure an open twenty-foot sewer
in its center. When the mid-summer sun t
last its rays upon the profuse collection of c
broken bottles, tin cans, oyster shells and
lead cats, our law makers were certainly
iot ignorant of its existence, and even a
ramp could despise it. To cover that
-anal will be a crowning glory of John Fitz
atrick's administration.
In a previous letter I suggested the pos
ibility of the New Orleans and Shell Bench
Railroad Company taking ad-vantage of
heir charter, and pushing on down to Port
tads. This would make it possible to take
ear loads of cotton, grain and produce right
brough New Orleans to a more convenient
shipping point. Since then it has trans.
mired, as it appears from interview of rail
oad officials by the reporter of a city paper,
hat negotiations are actually under way to
ooomplish this object. Agents of the rail
oad company have broached the subject to
iorthern capitalists, and surveyors agree
hat the line can be extendad without en
ountering any extraordiLary difficulties or
avolving a heavy outlay. Business men
re disposed to ridicule the project, and
hink the deep water of the river and su
erior port privileges will entirely over
hadow any attempted rivalry at Port Eads,
ut their sagacity has never bt ea conspic
ously evinced on any previous c a ion,
ad it somewhat lessens faith in their utter
noes on this subject.
Last Sunday I stood on Canal street and
itnessed the parade of the labor organz -
ons represented in the Trades Assembly-
veritable confederacy of labor. There
ere several thousand brawny men in line,
lack and white, all in unison to impre.s
ton the employers of New Orleans, t t fli
ider the republicann form of governmtent
erc "re nary r:overeigt s and ea h . pow i
er in the land. The freight handlers are
on a strike. They object to railroads em
ploying workmen not members of New
Orleans unions, though paid a like price.
They say railroads should not importlabor,
uQe it in the business season, and then re
turn to their homes at the close, when ai
sufficient number of laborers can be ob
tained in New Orleans. It strikes me that
while there is wisdom in combining laborers
to secure living wages, it is overstepping
the bounds to demand that railroads con
fine themselves to a particular locality or
particular persons in selecting their em
ployds. In this United States of America
citizens of any State or city ate guaranteed
the,right to remove from one place to an
other, for any peaceable purpose whatso
ever. This right should be respected as
well as the right of employers to choose
their employes. Men of the North, it seems,
till the fields and gather the harvest there,
and in winter are idle, and must seek em
ployment, and some of them are willing to
handle freights in New Orleans. It is prob
able they have been drawn here by the ad
vertisements of the World's Exposition to
be held in a growing city. But if people
don't come here, how is the city to grow?
If new comers are to be met by hostile dem
onstrations of unwelcome, why will they
want to stay here? The freight handlers
on a strike have appealed to the Chamber
of Commerce to side with them as against
the freight handlers who are at work, and
they may be able to induce the railroad men
to partially concede the demands of the
strikers, but the result can only be tempo
rary, and brought about to facilitate com
merce. Just such demands will be power
ful incentives to the Port Eands movement
and the avoidance of the labor combina
tion depositing the freight elsewhere. It
can not be denied that these well-meaning
strikers and deserving laborers, have a
large share of the sympathy of the commu
nity; yet a cause to be impregnable should
have a little more of right at its founda
tion. It is a blessing to the majority of the
people to have railroads; of course the men
who build them are capitalists, as every
one of the strikers will be if the chances
are favorable; and every man of them has
a right to put such domestics in his kitchen
as he thinks proper, and would think it
downright impertinence if all the other do
mestics objected because not enrolled in
their benevolent society.
John McEnery has sounded the war whoop
for his brother Sam, and says John Fitz
patrick must go to the wall. More anon.

THE Boss CAMSE.-Under this title thi
Iberville South notes the receipt of a stall
of cane measuring 8 feet 9 inches in lengtl
and containing 20 joints, which the editor
thinks is the "boss cane of 1883." and in
quires "who can beat it?" If Assnmptioi
is admitted to the competition, we desire
to say that we have a stalk of white cane it
our office, received last week from the Hall
Way plantation of Mr. J. E. Vicknail
which is 9 feet, 8 inches long and has 24
joints. The query of the South is re-echoed

"Blessed be the man," said Don Quixote's
weary squire, " who invented sleep." Sancho's
gratitude is ours, but what if one can not for
any reason enjoy that excellent invention?
"Nervousness in me had become a disease,"
writes Mr. William Coleman, the well known
wholesale druggist of Buffalo, N. Y.
"I could not sleep, and my nights were
either past in that sort of restlessness which
nearly crazes a man, or in a kind of stupor,
haunted by tormenting dreams. Having taken
PARKEB'S ToNIc for other troubles, I tried it
also for this. The result both surprised and
delighted me. My nerves were turned to con
cert pitch, and, like Caesar's fat men. I fell into
the ranks of those who sleep o' nights. I should
add that the tonic speedily did away with the
condition of general debility and dyspepsia
occasioned by my previous sleeplessness, and
gave me strength and perfect digestion. In
brief, the use of the Tonic thoroughly re~stab
lished my health. I have used PARKER'S To-.c
with entire success for sea-sickness and for the
bowel disorders incident to ocean voyages."
This preparation has heretofore been known
as PARKER S GINGER TONIO. Hereafter it will
be advertised and sold under the name of PAR
KER'S ToNirc-omitting the word "ginger."
Hiscox & Co. are induced to make this change
by the action of unprincipled dealers who have
for years deceived their customers by substitu.
ting inferior preparations under the name of
ginger. We drop the misleading word all the
moro willingly, as ginger is an unimportant
flavoring ingredient in our Tonic.
Please remember that no change has been, or
will be, made in the preparation itself, and all
