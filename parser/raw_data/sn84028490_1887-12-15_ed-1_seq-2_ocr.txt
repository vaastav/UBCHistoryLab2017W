Mb. Chairman and Gentlemen of
the Y. M. D. C: You have assembled
tonight for the third time since your
organization tor tne purpose of elect
ing your officers for the year 1888.
Your organization is one that the
Democracy of this city and county may
well teei proud.
As your presiding officer, I feel proud
of this organ' zation and the dignity with
which you nave conducted yourselves,
and the respect wnicn you nave won
from men of all political creeds. As
political factor you are a power. As
social organization you stand second
to none m the city.
Your watchword, "Eternal vigilance
is the price of good government, and
the bouiulen duty of the citizen." Your
object "To promote the welfare of the
Democratic party, and the mamteii
ance of good government."
In my address one year ago 1 cau
tioued you as to the action that you
take in the nomination ot candurites,
and, as this is my iirst opportunity.
thank you for uniting as one man, and
for your earnest work for the success
or the ticket nominated tor the inun
icipal election hist spring, and the one
nominated for the J ovember election.
I also thank you tor the honor that you
have conferred upon me by electing me
to tne nignest in in ; gut or tins organ
ization, and for the support that you
.have given every action that 1 have
taken as president of this organization
And 1 trust that you will give my sue
cessor, whoever he may be, the same
support, rue increasing ot the Demo
crafic majorities in the city and town
ship each year since you have been
organized, is a testimonial of the ser
vices that you have rendered the Demo
cratic party. .Let us coutinue to
increase the majorities.
The victory gained by the Democrats
on the 8th day ot last JS ovember is one
that is well worth having. There is no
use trying to believe it or to say that
it is of no great account. The contest
in New York, being the most import
ant, the tight had become national, be
cause it was generally believed that
.... Ti. .... ...l .
uio luiiuuta ui u;e present uuiiimistiii
tion were in large measure involved in
that contest. The republicans at a
harmonious convention nominated
strong ticket, headed by Col. Fred
Grant, whose name it "w is thought
would draw thousands or votes. Tnev
conducted an aggressive and vigorous
canvass; they presented their best
speakers before mass meetings, helu in
all important points in the .state; and
their defeat cannot be called a case of
financial embarrassment, and all estl
mates made on previous ligures pointed
to the election ot Cole nel itiant. livery
tiling looked favorable for the success
of the Uepublicau part v. and no one
was prepared to see that State go Dem
ocratic by such a large majority. It
was a surprise to the victors themselves.
It shows too that New York, the pivot
al State in presidential contests, is still
. under the control of the Democracy,
jrom bovernor to engineer they con
tinue in power. The Republicans
forced the tight, but the voter did his
outy and endorsed our worthy 1'resi
dent, and his policy. And in the
language of Sunset Cox: "We have
won the election for this year and foi
next." In Virginia the Democrats won
a splendid victory capturing the Legis
lature. This insures a Democratic
successor to Senator Kiddleberger, and
it lays out Billy Mahoue. In Iowa
the Democrats made good gains, and
the Republicans saved their banner
.State by a scratch. I believe hereafter
that Iowa will be claimed among the
. .doubtful States. In our State the Re
publicans have carried it, but we have
lost nothing and they have gained noth
ing. Foraker's vote being less than it
was two years ago, and it was a neces
sity with them, they had to carry the
State this year, or how could they mar
. shall their forces in the next President
, Jal contest. In this county we have
lost nothing but the Board of Commis
sioners, and that will be just for one
year. The Democracy has cause to feel
! very joyful over the result of the No
vember elections.
The next Presidential contest is ap
proaching, a id there seems to be no
opposition in the Democratic party to
Grover Cleveland succeeding himself.
President Cleveland, in his message on
Jast Monday, has recommended that
the revenues be reduceu. And we may
expect that the same cry, that the in
dustries of the country are threatened,
will be raised as was done three years
ago, in hopes that the industrial and
commercial interests of the country
will again be arrayed against us.
Democrats must be prepared to meet
this question. We should then at this
time, give the question acaref ul consid
eration, for it is not in the heat of a
campaign, when men's minds are warp
ed by political prejudices, that they can
give to this question that careful con
sideration which its importance de
serves. AVould it not be well then for
us at this time, to take a careful survey
of the facts, and thus be able the better
to judge, whether President Cleveland's
recommendations in regard to the tar
iff, do in anyway threaten the welfare
of our labor, or the prosperity of our
great commercial and industrial inter
ests. This cry is as baseless as that made
during the last political campaign.; It
was then prophesied that a change in
- administration was not possible with
out the most disastrous financial, com
mercial and industrial results. This
prophesy has been disproved by the
fact that there has been an evident
and sound revival of commercial and
financial prosperity. And now that
President Cleveland has again recom
mended a reduction of revenues,, we
may expect a recurrence of these evil
prophesies, as they all emanate from
the same source, the American Iron
and Steel Association.
Let us look for a moment for the reas
ons which impel these gentlemen of the
American Steel Association to give ex
pressions to such gloomy forebodings.
that any reduction in tariff duties
would injure their industries. Are their
fears the expressions of an honest be
lief; or is this cry simply raised to ward
off a reduction of the duties which have
made them milllonares. Of this the
people must be the judge, and in order
that we may better judge, it is neces
, sary that w& have a clear idea, and a
correct understanding of the facts in
the case. ,
Let ns take for example the duties
on steel rails, and tee whether or not
these duties can or should be reduced.

nier had a patent on the steel process,
and like any other article patented, he
miaht have chained any price for it. In
lSo'J he was selling steel vails at 110
per ton. In 18U his patent rau out,
and steel rails fell to 853 per ton. lu
18119 in this country the price of Bess
eoier steel rails was $1&2.50 per ton;
and 1871 the price then was 103 per
ton, and the manufacturers of steel
rails in this country seeing that they
could now have the benefit of Bessemer s
invention, and wishing to ward off
foreign competition, sent a confidential
communication to the Committee on
Ways and Aleans of Congress, asking
for a duty of two cents a pound or $44.
80 per ton on steel. Now notice right
here, that this duty was proposed by
the very men who expected to reap the
benefit, and not by Congress at its own
instance. They did not wish the real
reasons and motives to be known. This
letter, nevertheless, was a very honest
document; they put in no id'.e words.
They proposed by means of a heavy duty
on foreign steel to keep that out of the
country, and with their own mills then
running to supply the whole domestic
market. But the Committee and Con
gress did not give them all that they
asked, two cents per pound, or $44.80
per ton, but only hve-eightus oi wnat
they asked, or 828 per ton. Now how
did this duty operate: 1st. So far as
the people were concerned. 2d. So far
as tne labors were concerned?
First, then as to how it affects the
people: For the thirteen years ending
in 1883. there were produced in the
United States, ti,!i44,750 tons of steel
rails. The, average higher American
price of rails for those thirteen years
than English rails was 22.15 per ton,
which average higherprice was the only
motive for lavine the duty on the for
eign rails. That is to say, that the effect
ot the laying of the duty was to increase
the average American price, not to the
full extent of the duty, 828 per ton, but
to only 80 per cent of the duty, that u
S22.15. Now multiply the total num
ber of tons produced by the average
higher price, occasioned by the duty
and you have the enormous sum of
Sirj3.822.212.50.
Senator Blaine in his Farmington
speech, estimated that the steel rail
men made for themselves, for the (if
teen years ending in 1885, 8250,000,000.
3103,822,212 oi which is directly trace
able to the enect of the tariff. Accord
imr to Blaine, their profits were 8250,
(XKMKK1 Had it not been for the tariff,
these profits would have been less the
8153,822,212, which would have left
their profits $'.)7,000 000, on a capital of
820,000,000, or 33.3 per cent, on the
money invested. But as it was. their
profits were 8250,000,000, over 77 per
cent, on the capital invested.
The facts that were brought to the
attention of the public by a litigation
brought before the Orphan's Court of
Pennsylvania, in regard to the estate of
J.Edgar Thompson, a large steel rail
manufacturer, show in a very tangible
and precise form the profits that have
been reauzeu oy'tne steel ran manuiac
ers in which Mr. Thompson was a stock
holder, and showed that there had been
several years during the decade of 1870
and 1880 in which the profits amounted
to 77 per cent. Take the year 1880.
There were produced in the United
States 851,700 tons of steel rails; and
the average difference in price of Amer
ican over English rails was 827.50 per
ton, multiply the number or tons pro
duced by the average difference in
price, and you have the enormous sum
of 823,421,750 received above the Eng
lish price. The American rail makers,
by means of the duty collected iroin
the people, 823,421,750, on the pretence
that it was needed to cover tne oiner-
ence between the wages paid by them
and their English competitors. But
the whole wages paid by the American
makers to their workmen in this same
year amounted to only $4,934,321). That
is to say, they collected from the people
by reason ot the duty $is,4!W,4-o more
in that year than they paid to their la
borers: and yet we are expected to be
lieve that this duty was paid by the
naATkla nnt ot oil -fnr t-ho ViunoHt fi' tlitt
manufacturer, but solely for the benefit
otthe laoorers. uadttie people paid
the laborers employed double the
amount of wages they actually receiv
ed, and allowed them to live a life of
idleness and ease, and paid the manu
facturers i percent, interest on the cap
ital invested, they would have Baved in
that year by the operation, the sum of
813,354,0112, and would have been able
to have bought their rails at 827.50 per
ton cheaper.
Now who is it that has paid the in
crease in price ot 81o3,822,212? Of
course the railroad companies pay it in
the first instance. Jiut 1 am pursuaded
believe that if the companies were
relieved from this tribute they are now
compelled to pay they would give such
rates as . even the grangers never
dreamed of. The duty on rails increases
the cost of railroad building about
83,000 per mile, and the dividend on
this of course has to be paid in the
second instance by merchants, farmers
and others, who are compelled to pay
high rates of freight for the transporta
tion of their merchandise and crops.
fhis being a wheat growing and manu
facturing State, the farmer and manu-
icturers are especially injured by this
class of duties.
Governor Gear, of Iowa, a Republican
revenue reformer, in his inaugural
address in speaking of the question
said: "To a State whose products
which are in the main agricultural as
are those of Iowa, anything which en
hances the cost of railways, thereby
even incidentally in the least degree in
creasing the expenses of transportation
her products to the seaboard, which
her great market, is a question of
great interest to all. In view of their
greater strength and durability which
essens the cost of replacement, all the
great trunk railway lines of the country
are adopting Bessemer steel rails. The
manufacturers of this class of rails In
the United States is controlled by a
combination of not exceeding, I think,
ten firms in number. This combina
tion is protected by a high special tariff
which prevents the imposition, of
foreign rails to any extent, thereby in
creasing the cost of railways of the
country.' Without discussing the tariff
question in all Its bearings, it may well
considered whether it Is wise legisla
tion, by a tariff exceptional in its char
aster, to put immense profits into the
pocKets oi a monopoly composed of but
few persons, at the expense, Indirectly,
not only of the Iowa farmers but of the
whole west."
Senator Grimes. Iowa's greatest
Republican Senator, and once Governor
of that State said: "It is enough to
make the devil laugh with glee, to see
the farmers voting to support a high
tariff, which doubles the cost of railroad
iron, spikes, chairs, locomotives, ten
ders, cars, etc., the effect of which is to
double the cost of transportation of all
they produce, and what they consume,
ana then hear them irrowl about the
rates of passage and freight, not for a
moment reflecting that they, by their
votes, impose these high rates of freight
on themselves."
What Governor Gear and Senator
Grimes have said of Iowa, is equally
applicable to this State, and if the Dem
ocrats of this State would take as firm
and uncompromising a position on the
question as the Democrats of Iowa
have done, the result would be m"T
1
favorable to the Democratic party than
it has been, and that the people of
Iowa are fast coming, to- loot' at this
question as .aid Governor Gear and
senator Gridies, is cle irly shown by the
election results. .Garlleld carrie i the
State by a majority of 78,069, and in
1885 Larabee carried the State against
a combined opposition by a majority of
6 979, and this year, had the opposition
been combined he would have had less
than 5,000 -majority. The Democrats
made the tight in Iowa, largely upon
the question of revenue reform.
second, so tar as ine laoorers are con
cerned, what has been the effect of the
duty, that this enormous arunciai gain
or profit just referred to, redounded
wholly to the benefit of the laborers, is
clearly shown by the census reports?
In 1870 the average annual wages paid
to the laborers In the iron and Bteel in
dustries of all kinds was 8454.26, and
during the year 1870, the tariff ou steel
rails was doubled. After ten years of
this hinh tariff, the average wages, ac
cording to the census reports of 1880,
was only 8393.51, a decliue of 800.75, or
13? per cent., and in 1884, according to
Bradstreet theie was a further decline
of 20 ner cent, niakine a total of de
clines since 1870 of 33 per cent. A nd
yet this steel rail monopoly, this
association of eleven companies made
a close corporation by paying bo much
money per ton into a jock pot, and in
1877 8 they paid one ot their number,
the Vulcan steel rail rolling mills of
St. Louis. 870.000 for stopping work
and discharging their hands, so as to
restrict the production and thus keep
up prices, while the tariff had been
growing all this time more and mora
urotective.
According to Senator Beck, in 1881
only 8 8-10 per cent, of the value of
the products of the Bessemer steel in
dustries went to tne laoorers empioyeu,
while titi 9-10 per cent, went to the capi
talists as profits. And yet it is said
that if we propose to reduce tha tariff
protection mis couiouiiiuuii inratr.-i.
that we strike a blow at the laborer
But may we not well say that so far -as
its laborers are concerned, protection as
we uow have it is a swindle, a snare
and a curse. It has created during the
lust twenty years the greatest pluti c-
racy that the world has ever seen. Un
der its operation the rich have grown
richer and the uoor poorer.
This duty on steel rails enabled a
subject of the Uueen of Great Br. tain
who never gave up his allegiance to the
Queen, and whose proudest boast was
that he was not an American citizen,
and who located in Pittsburg and went
into the manufacture ot steel rails,
although he did not own the entire
works, he drew out of the establishment
during a period of three hundred days,
profits amounting to 85,000 i er.day, or
81.500,000 in oneyear. Anuytu tnese are
the very same men who will be at the
head of the opposition to the le-election
of President Cleveland, and who give
expression to these most gloomy tore
boilings of evil, and prophesy that
nothing but ruin awaits them if this
tariff be touched.
There is yet another class of duties to
which I desire to call your attention;
not that I intend to go into the ones
tion in all its details, but only for the
purpose of briuging the subject to your
attention. Namely, the duty on lum
ber. The duty on lumber is indefensible
and niexcusaoie irom any point oi
view that we may look at it. Whether
you consider climatic consideration or
whether you iook ai it Iioin tne yuiiit
of view of the free trader, it makes no
difference. That the denuding of our
forests has great influence on our cli
mate is no longer doubted. From this
consideration alone the offering ot a
bounty for this taking away nt our for
ests is wholly indefensible. But I do
not propose to discuss this .view of the
ouestion. -
The duty or two uonars per tnousano
on rough lumber either does or does
not increase the price of lumber to the
consumer. If it does not, then there
can be no valid objection to the repeal
of the duty, as the government is al
ready collecting more than 8100,000,000
a year more than it neeus to pay us
legitimate expenses. If it does, theu
the duty is a grievous burden on the
mass of the people. That this duty
does increase the price of lumber ad
mits of no donbt. tor a careful compar
ison of prices clearly shows it. During
the last year there has been consumed
in the city of Canton alone, according
to the best estimates given me by the
various lumber dealers and contractors,
about 3o.0tx,000 feet. It the
effect of the tariff has been to increase
the price in lumber to the full extent
of the duty, then the people of Canton
have paid 8H0.000 more for their lum
ber this year than they ought to have
paid. This is 82.50 for every, man,
woman and child in this city. That
money would have bought a pair of
shoes for every man woman and child
in this city; or it would have built
nearlv 100 homes for the families of
nearly 100 workmen; or it would have
built a sewer system, that might in the
end save the lives of hundreds of our
citizens; or the (50.000 taken each year
out ot the city might be the means ot
bringing new industries, which would
in turn give employment to hundreds
of workmen, as has already been done
in bringing the Deuber Works to our
city; or at any rate, had this money
been left in the pockets of the people,
where it rightly belongs, they would
have had that much more to spend for
the support of themselvse and their
families; or look at it from another point
in view, what kind of justice is it for
the government of the United States to
lay a tax to the enect or wnicn is to
take 8(50,000 by the way of enhanced
prices for lumber alone, each year out
of the nockets of the people of Canton.
to pour it into the pockets of the lum
1 1 - C f : I . ; ., ,1 lirianaln U

What sort of justice is it to take money
by law by dimes and dollars, out of
the pockets of the many, to place in the
pockets of the few? The Supreme
Court of the United States, in the cele
brated Topeka case, (reported in the 20
Wallace, pages S5 and (5(58.1 says. , '-'To
lay with one hand the power of ;the
government ou the property of the icit
lzens, and with the other bestow it dp
on favored individuals, to aid private
enterprises and build up private for
tunes is none.thelesrobbery,becauseit
is done under forms ot law, aud is call
ed taxation." . i !
Bv as much as the manufacturer and
contractor are compelled to pay higher
prices for their materials, by so much
do they pay lower prices to their work
men. H en, uut says tne protectionist,
we do not claim that the duty on
lumber is for the benefit of the
workmen of Canton, but for the benefit
of the workmen of the lumber regions
of the north-west. But even thisis not
true, for wages in the lumber regions of
the north-west are no higher than the
wages in the lumber regions of Canada.
As a matter of fact, lumber costs less
on board of cars to our own north-west-flrn
lumbermen than it does to the lum
bermen of Canada. I have not time to
give you the exact ligures, but I speak
advisedly, the proposition is suscept
ible of proof. 1
President Arthur in one of his mess
ages, strongly recommended Congress
to take some action to prevent the
rapid destruction of our forests. Con
irress Daid no heed to his recommen
dations, and the process of destruction
is still going on, ana in a iew 1 mure

Much more might be said but time
will not allow. ' Suffice it to say, that in
view of the principles of the Demo
cratic party, its traditions, and the
pledges made in the platforms In the

cock in 1880, and that of President
Cleveland in 1884, to repeal, revise and
reduce the tariff in accordance.
with the Democratic principles and
precedents. 1 regard the discussion of
this question one of paramount impor
tance. This is the question that we,
the young Democrats who have grown
up since the war, are compeueu to iuee.
TTnon the truth or falsity of the prin
ciples laid down by President Cleveland
in his message, we must stand or fall,
in the next Presidential contest. And
that we shall win 1 have no doubt, if
we give to him and the cause he has so
ably championed, that support which
they deserve. But if we shirk, dodge
and give him only a half hearty support
we shall fail. The tariff theu is the
issue, Cleveland is our leader, and his
message is our platform. A new gen
eration is now upon the tiefdof political
strife, and it has its iew cares, new
responsibilities, and new questionp to
settle. As our lathers naa tueir worn
to do, and did it well, so we have ours,
and should likewise do it well. While
it is true, as Carlyle so well said, "that
it is upon lanus 01 our iatuer s unngf
with the stuble of their harvest still
upon it that we must work," yet we
have a work of our own to do. We can
not hone to win political battles today
by fighting over again the old and worn
out political issues settled a quarter of
a cntury ago bv the dread arbitrament
of war. Then this is a new occasion,
and shall we not remember the words
of the poet, that

At the conclusion of the address,
Vice President Mayer arose and said.
he had not the power of language to
eulogize the President for his persistent
effort in delivering such an able address
and he called upon Charles B. i'razer

Mr. Frazer paid a glowing tribute to
the President's address, and then in be

with a hadsome gold medal that was

both Mr. Monnot and the members of
the Club, the former for the able man
ner in which he directed the Club in
the past, and the latter for selecting
him as their leader in the future. Suc
cess always attends their efforts.
The Commissioners.
The County Commissioners have
been .actively engaged this morning,
having finished up the transcripts and
concluded their work in allowing sheep
claims. Mr. Laiblin, of the board, said
that the amount would reach nearly
81400. He said a great disadvantage
they have to contend with is the enor
mous claims of Borne people in their
bills for damages. He cited one in
stance where sheep had been returned
to the assessor at 82 a head, and the
party put in a bill for 812 for their de
struction. This could not be allowed
and hereafter they would take the
amount returned on the Assessors'
books as their guide in allowing claims
in the spring and by the weight of the
sheep in the fall. I
The Commissioners also went to the
new bridge, in course of construction
on Eas Fourth street, this morning,
and examined the work on the founda
tion and found it all correct and will
advertise in a few dayB for bids on the
iron work. They also took a tour of
inspection through the jail and found
it in good shape.
The County Treasury.
Messrs. W. A. Creech and C. C. Bow,
examiners appointed by Judge Fawcett
to look over the books of the Auditor
and Treasurer, and count the money
in the county treasury, have completed
their work and handed in their report.
It shows an amount of 8(54,4(50.42 in the
treasury; the books show balances of
814,451.22, and overdrafts of $31,995.83,
which leaves a balance of 862,455.39
on the books, hence there is an excess
of 82,005.03 in the treasury over what is

Republican leaders think poorly of
the President's message.
It is a constitutional, common sense
message and presents unanswerable
facts and arguments. -
Republicans admit "inequalities in
the tariff" and also the need of reducing
the surplus.
And these are just what the President
wishes to have done. The people too
are with the President.
The points in President Cleveland's
message are well taken, and cannot be
met and successfully answered hy re
publican leaders.
That beautiful Republican bird
with plumage grand, that has tlown so
tearrifTy tariff high, is fluttering badly
at the rresment's rnessage.

About Ave years ago I suffered from painful urin
ation anil great pain and weakness In tbe. lower part
o my b:i( pain In tbe llmtis.liad taste In Uie nioutb
distrust at food, and great mental and bodily de
pression.
I lire at 241 York street, Jersey City, and on arriv
ing home one niKlit 1 found a copy of the Shakkr
Almanac that had lievn lert during Uie day. I read
the article, "What Is this Disease Ujat Is Coming
Upon Us?1' It described my symptoms and feelings
better than I could II I had written a whole book.
My trouble was Indeed "like a thief In the night,"
fur It bad been stealing upon me unavaresfor years.
I sent for a bottle of Shaker Extract of Roots, or
Seigel's Syrup, and before I had taken one-lialf of It
I felt the welcome relief. In a few weeks I was like
my old self. I enjoyed and digested my food. My
kidneys soon recovered tone and strength, and the
orlnary trouble vanished. I was well.
Millions of people need some medicine simply to
act on the bowels. To them I commend Shaker ex
tract In Uie strongest possible terras. It Is tbe gent
lest, pleasantest, safest and surest purgative In this
world. The most delicate women and children may
take 1L One point more: I have all the more confi
dence Id Ihls medicine because It Is prepar d by the
Snak irs. J may claim to bo a religions man myself
and I admire Uie Shakers for their seal, consistency
and str'ct business integrity. "What they make may
