It will he in order to congratulate
Judge Brantly on his election. He

tana. There will be no contest over
his electio'n.
Assistant Naval ('onstructor Hob
son will sail for Manila in a few days
to superintend the raising of the
sunken Spanish war vessels in the
harbor. He is reconlmlended for pro
motion by the president to naval
constructor.
The peace treaty was signed in
Paris last Saturday and nothing
serious occurred to mar the last pro
ceedings, although it is said the dons
were a trifle sulky. The American
conunmlssioners will probably sail for
home this week.
Chicago is having her first catshow,
and strange as it lmay seem, there Is
not ni replresentative fronm Cat island
there.--(reat Falls Leader.
Are you sure you scanned the ceit
alogue carefully? The cat found on
the Cristobal Colon at the timeof the
catstrolphe near Santiago, is on
exhibition.
The total vote of Montana thsl
year was a triile less than 50.000,
against ,4..NNH) in iS0;, a heavy vote
considering that this is an off year.
There in little donuilt but Montana

T'Iwo years ago the I epublican vote
was 11).7,M:t at the recent election
Thus . (. .1l'rshall. (aididate for coin
gress, re.eiv'.d 14.s:.0, showing a gain
of nearly ,,t4t10. The figures indicate
that i,.tpuimlieans are falling back
into line w\ith the'ir party, and there
will be itoIre ill 114.IHN). After discov
ering thait thlie I)emlltC'.ralts are really
to dropl the silver issue when it fails
to secure the ottices they will return
to the plrty that has the welfare of
the whole country at heart.
Secretary Alger says it Is proposed
to send regnhlir regiments to relieve
the volunteers in .Mianila just as soon
as transplortation can Ie' arranged.
The voluliteers will tbe returned to
the Inited States ill tlihe order in
which they left. T'his will bring the
troop ill the following order: First
('nlifurnia, First Oregon, First Col
ravdo, Tenth I'lennsylvania and the
Utah hattery. As the Montana regi
Inltelt was ialb,.ult the last to arrive at
Manila it will lprobably ble one of the
last to retullin. Much depends, nlso,
upon what a'ction congress takes re
gardling an increatse of the regular
army. Should action be taken at
this session and the army greatly
augmrented. the new recruits would
relieve the vtolulnteers il the Philip
pines and elsewhere. All this takee
time,. however. and if the Montana
boys do not return home before next
fall it should surprise no one. There
will be little necessity for their pro
tracted stay in the Philippinesunless
Agulnaldo shoull prove obstinate
and inaugurate a revolt against
American control, which is hardly
probalble.
The allunsin by Pr.sident McKin
ley in his message to the destruction
of the Maine has stirred up the ire of
the Spanish press and it is making
some very bold charges. The Impar
cial says: "The partisansof the war
realized that something startling
wats ell(essary to arouse national
sentiment. It was a remarkable
chance. Almost all the Maine's offi
cers were on I,oaurd another ship at
the time of the catastrophe. Those
who charge the Spaniards with being
capable of such a monstrous act are
well capable of committing it them
eelves." The aboveshows with what
little consideration Spain holds the
lives of her common seamen. Just
as though the absence of the officers
of the Maine would render the time
opportune for the destruction of the
ship by the "partisans of the war."
No American or anyone in sympathy
with the Cubans would have jeopard
ized the life of one of the Maine'screw
to aid the Cuban cause. While it Is
possible that those high in authority
in the Spanish government have no
knowledge of the perpetrators of the
hellish deed, there is little doubt but
some parties in sympathy " r con
nected with flle Spanish army in
Cuba is responsible. This view will
always be entertained by Americans.
For the first time in the history of
this country the balance of trade is
on our side. The lines representing
imports and exports of manufac
tures have been wide apart for many
years, the imports until now far ex
ceeding in value the exports. In 1s0
the imports were valuvd at $2L60,000,
000 anid the exports at $100,u0,000.
In 1~3 the imports amounted to
$3..),000,000 and the exports to $130,
000,000. In 18$8 the imports amounted
to $325,000,000 and the exports to
$120,000,000. In 1893 the imports were
valued at $368,000,000 and the exports
at $190,000,000. In 1896, when Mc
Kinley was elected, the Imports were
valued at $.30,000.000 and theexport
at $230,000,000. This year the situa
tion ham been reversed, the imports
amount to $229,991,231 and the ex
ports to $291,2I0,35s'. This is a re
markable showing for the first year
of the Dingley law and does not in
dicate the presence of that "Chinese
"wall" \we heard so much about thret
or fltour years ag8o, miand it does not
appear that America has "lout thi
markets ",fithe world" to any alarm
ing extent by adhering to the policy
of pr' tection to American industries.
The imports of manufactures into
the United States in the fiscal year
1l9tn were thirty per cent less than
those of 'lbt, although the popula.
tion has increased twenty-five pet
cent. meantime.
The President's Message.
President McKinley's annual mees
age is a lengthy production and one
of the most important state paper,
to issue from the executive of the
nation for many years past. This i|
not owing to the recommendations
contained therein but to the stirring
events of the past year which made
their recital necessary in order thai
the people as well as congress may
become advised of every act per.
formed by the coummnander-in-chie
of the army in the prosecution of the
war. In this regard it is a moastcom.
plete history of the conflict, told in
a straightforward and unassunmin
manner.
There is some criticism of the mees
sage because the president did not
take it upon himself to outlin- a pol.
icy for the government of the Philip.
pines. It would certainly have beeIt
in had taste to anticipate the antionli
of the 'pace ciullomissioner.ll andil offe'
sullggesti.Iils before tlhe treamlty wni
signed. This and other iUiilnrtuiii
I questions resulting fromi the war will
be treaterd in aI specil llmesscage at a
later date.
However, the president hais made
recommendations, and the followingi
nre amolnig the monire important ones
to which he invites the attention ol
congress:
Self-government for Cuba "tit thll
earliest moment consistent witl
safety and assured success. A just.
humanlle and bIenevolent governmenit'
in which "neither revenge or olnssiori
should have a place.-" i demanadedo
Military occupation to continue in
SDefinlite action on the Nicaragua,
,_canal qu(estion by congress at thi
e present sessi.on, bearing in mind thai
i "our national polley now Imore im
t peratively than ever calls for contro
e by this government."
, Appropriations for fifteen new waj
ships.
r Increase of the standing army tc
t 100,000 men.
Initiation of steps for an int(rna.
tional agreement to exempt all pri.
vate property at sea from capture o.
destruction in time of war.
Legislation to foster the merchant
t marine.
e Legislation for the government ol
Hawaii, after considering the report
of the Cullom special commission.
Increase of the appropriation for
t the Paris exposition to $1,000,000.
Im mediate enactment of legi4lation
setting aside a portion of the gold
holdings of the treasury as a trust
fund for the redemption of green
backs, but providing thatgreenbacks
once redeemed shall not thereafter be
paid out except for gold.

S Imer?
We never did; but we have
seen the clothing at.this time
of the year so covered with
dandruff that it looked as if it
had been out in a regular snow
storm.
No need of this smowstorm.
As the summer sun would
melt the falling snow so will
Aqers
hi!i
melt these flakes of dandruff In
the scalp. It goes further than
this: it prevents their formation.
It has still other properties:
it will restore color to gray hair
in just ten times out of every
ten cases.
And it does even more: it
feeds and nourishes the roots
of the hair. Thin hair becomes
thick hair; and short hair be
comes long hair.
We have a book on the Hair
and Scalp. It is yours, for the
asking.
If you do not obtain all the benefits
you expected from the use of the Vigor,
write the doctor about it. Probably
there is some dificulty with your gen
eral system which may be easily re
moved. Address
