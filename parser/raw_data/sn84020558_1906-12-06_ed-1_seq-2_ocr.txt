THE LOrrED OFF BATTALION".
The affair of the discharge of that
negro batallion at Fort Reno gives
promise of being on Interesting one
early In the present session of congress.
There are several contributory causes to
make It so. There are those who be
lieve that the negroes were not given
a square deal. There are others who
will be inclined to criticise the unusual
action of the president on general
grounds and to these two groups mav
be added a democratic contingent
watchful 'of every opening for a poli
tical attack.'
The friends of the president will
naturally endeavor to effect a divorce
between the main question at Issue and
the race problem.
This was outlined early In the con
troversy by a friendly newspaper at
the time when it became evident that
that matter would be made the sub
ject of congressional inquiry. It said-
"Probably the president's order
would not have excited wide comment
if the fact had not been made known
that the soldiers were colored. Its
propriety would have been assumed as
a matter of course and as a proper
measure of army discipline. The col
or question. In fact, has nothing to
do with the case. We presume no col
ored man or friend of colored men. will
claim that colored soldiers should be
exempt from the rules that apply t.i
white soldiers.
"President Roosevelt is absolutely
above suspicion of race prejudice or of
acting from any other motive than the
good of the service. To bring in the
color of the dismissed battalion is to
Inject a false and and Irrelevant issue
and becloud the merits of the case."
There is In the way of a general ac
ceptance of this view, the fact that
such a wholesale dismissal of troops is
unprecedented; that the troops dis
missed were negroes; that similar dis
turbances In garrison towns or nearby
towns have been frequent. In which
disturbances white soldiers were the
offenders.
The question will likely be asked in
congress as well as out of it, whether
If the Twenty-fifth battalion had been
composed of white soldiers instead of
negroes it would now lie hewn from
the United States army.
It will also probably be asked wheth
er in the 166 men so discharged, ther
were not some wholly blameless of
wrong and whose long service in the
army had not earned for them some
thing better than disgraceful dismissa'.
NEW RULER OF ZION CITT.
Vollva, the new boss of Zion City,
seems to be the equal of Dowie in
egotism and self assertlveness. He
claims to hold his position by virtue
of divine selection, and makes this
statement: "I am not overseer by elec
tion, nor will I admit that there is an
other in Zion who could fill my place.
Every hand raised against me will go
down in destruction, and no petty co
terie of jealous plotters can oust me."
This is the man who a few months ago
denounced the pretensions of "Elijah"
Dowie as impudent and blasphemous.
It should be rembered though, that the
population of Zion City is composed of
weak minded people who are suscepti
ble to no other style of appeal. Dowie
imposed upon them by his colossal au
dacity, and Voliva must employ the
same method or lose his grip. The fact
that such a community is possible ex
plains the power of such leaders. Where
a Dowie could rule, a Voliva finds his
opportunity. It Is simply a grotesque
display of one phase or grade of hu
man nature.
We have received from a woman suf
frage bureau: "Looking at the walls of
her cell in the London Jail, Mrs. Mon
teflore read such Inscriptions as these
mementos of former occupants:
'Keep away from drink, or you'll come
back here again;' "Fannie Lee, six
months for stabbing;' and she left a
record of her visit In the enamel of the !
bricks: "Dora Montefiore, two months
for asking for votes for women.' Per
haps the authqrities who caused Mrs.
Montefiore to be locked up Implicated
her in that rather violent suffragette
attack upon numbers of parliament last
The Arizona Star is engaging in a '
jollification over the pui chase by the
smelter trust of a mine ntar Tucson,
and finds in th's transaction much en- :
touragement of the mining- Industry
there, and business generally. This is
proper and healthy joy. but from what
the Star said throughout the last cam
paign, we Inferred that in Its opinion
there were already too many trusts and
corporations in Arizona.'
When we have fully established the
Japanese in thelrtreaty rights, to send
their children to schools Intended for
white children, it might not be Improp
er to take up the American-citizen
light of the negro who cannot send his
children to a white school in many
American cities. Or, may a treaty with
a foreign power confer upon the citi
zens of that power rights In the United
States superior to those Its citizens en
Joy? That Is, may a treaty right be
more valuable and sacred than a birth
right? We suppose the litigation Insti
tuted at San Francisco yesterday will
determine all this.
If the Jaapnese had been whipped in
the war with Russia, little Inteiest
could have been aroused in their com
plaint against the San Francisco school
authorities in' the unlikely event that
they would have lodged complaint. Our
extreme deference to them now resem
bles the acquiescence of one who is
looking Into the muzzle of a revolver
in the hands of a highwayman.
Whether it regards it us a news item
worth while or not, we trust the Even
ing Outcast will at least acknowledge
the receipt of a copy of the president's
message. Or better still. It might be
returned to the White House marked
"unavailable for our columns."
An Indignant citizen of Ptescott pro
tests to the Journal-Miner against the
vicious practice of the boys of that
town of snowballing passers-by. This
protest should be given wide publicity
throughout the east, where an alto
gether contrary Impression of Arizona
prevails.
The small boy beginning to recover
from the Thanksgiving surfeit is ul
ready calculating what he would like
in the Christmas bill of fare.
If those Texans wno tried to lynch a
negro for wearing a K. of P. badge
were Pythians, they failed to recognize
a Damon In the negro.

RECEIVER'S SALE.
The Anita Copper Mines and Smelter
Sold to a Syndicate.
On Tuesday J. W. Francis , receiver
of the Anita Copper company sold at
private sale the property of that com
pany. C. t). Robinson was the pur
chaser and the price paid was S2.6'M),
Mr. Robinson making the purchase for
other parties, who will, it Is said, fur
ther develop a big body of copper ore.
The former owners spent a great deal
of money in machinery and develop
ment work on the mine but not getting
immediate returns the stockholders
quit contributing and the mine closed
down with the result of having the
property placed in the hands of a re
ceiver and sold at a fraction of the
part of the money Invested in the de
velopment of the property.
The sale included the smelter built
at Williams several yeais ago. The
mines are located about 45 miles north
of Williams and near the Grand Can
yon railroad. The trade from the mine
which will employ under the new own
ers about forty men Is tributary to
Williams. Coconino Sun.

AQAI5ST THE
Ladies' Home Journal.
Sending truth after a He. It Is an old
maxim that "a lie will travel seven
leagues while truth Is getting its boots
on," and no doubt hundreds of thousands
of good people read the unwarranted and
malicloas attack upon Dr. R. V. Pierce
and his "Favorite Prescription "published
In the May (1904) number of the Ladies
Borne Journal, with its great black dis
play headings, who never saw the hum
ble, groveling retraction, with its incon
spicuous heading, published two months
later. It was joldlT charged In the sland
erous and libelous article that Dr. Pierce's
Favorite Prescription, for the eure of
woman's weaknesses and ailments, con
tained alcohol and other harmful ingredi
ents. Dr. Pierce promptly brought suit
gainst the publishers - of the Ladies'
Home Journal, for $200,000,00 damages.
Dr. Pierce alleged that Mr. Bok, the
editor, maliciously published the article
containing such false and defamatory
matter wit the Intent of Injuring his
urtherraore, that no alcohol, or
irtous. or habit-forming, drugs
ere, contained in his "Fa-
ptlon"; that said medicine

i harmful Ingredients what-,

These facts were aio proven in Uie Xfiil of
the action In the Supreme Court. But tha
business of Dr. Pierce was (rreatir injured by
the publication of the libelous article with

'My Endorsement of Pe-ru-na Is

Ed. Crumbo.
ED. CRUMBO, Ex-Mayor of New
Albany, Ind., writes from 611 .
Oak street:
"My endorsement of Penma ia
based on its merits.
"If a man ia tick he looks anxiously
for sometMng which will core him,
and Penma will do the work.
'1 know that it will core catarrh of
the head or stomach, indigestion,'
headache and any weary or sick feel
ing. "It is bound to help anyone, if used
according to directions.
"I also know dozens of men who
speak in the highest terms of Peruna
and hare yet to hear of anyone being
disappointed in It."
Mr. Crumbo, in a later letter, dated
Aug. 25,1904, says:
"My health is good, at present, bnt if
I should have to take any more medi
cine I will fall back on Peruna.'
