Big Wholesale
Plant Wrecked
Early Morning Blaze Does $150,
000 Damage to Miner,
Read & Tullock
New Haven, Dec. 11. In a disas
trous Are which gutted the big four
story warehouses of the wholesale
grocery firm of. Miner, Read & Tul
lock at the corner of State and Water
streets before dawn- yesterday morn
ing; there was destroyed nearly $150,
000 worth of property. NoO called
until one side of the building was a
roaring furnace, the firemen, under
the direction of Chief Fancher, who
had only returned to the. city from
a long trip to the west a few hours
before the alarm for the fire came
in, made a gallant fight against the
flames.
When first discovered about 4:20 a.
m. it was believed that the blaze
might spread through the entire block
of wholesale, houses in lower State
street, but the , firemen managed to
save even a portionof the stock and
nractically all one side of the build
inga new addition which was divid
ed from the other part by iron and
fire doors.
The breaking of a pipe of illumi
nating gas caused the partial as
phyxiation of Firemen Howards En
sign and Charles Burns. , The former
was not badly hurt and soon recov-
ered when taken out of the building
into the open air. Burns became
wholly unconscious, however, and had
to be carried out of the buildfng.
The' blaze in the building was dis
coveredabout 4 o'clock in the morn
ing by the engineers on some of the
switching engines in the "cut."
The cause of the fire is a complete
mystery. One theory la to the efflt
that' the old , cause of mice or rats
and matches' was responsible. An
other possible cause was a spark
from a locomotive in the cut. It i3
not believed possible that the blaze
was started by the electric wiring, as
the plant has an electric outfit of its
own, and this was closed when the
factory plant was closed on Saturday.
It is believed that the blaze must
have Men smouldering in the second
floor for about 10 to 12 hours before
It broke out into flame and secured
the headway it had when discovered.
The company has offices in
Bridgeport, Meriden and New Britain
and the orders of the office here will
be filled from those points.

FULL PUBLICITY
URGEDJY TAFT
Regarding Issuance of Stocks
and Bonds by Railroads
Message Sent to
Congress
(Special from United Press.) '
Washington, Dec. 11 -Full publicity
regarding issuance of stocks and
bonds -by railroads is the chief recom
mendation -of .the railroad securities
commission, submitted to Congress,
today,' by President Taft, in a special
message.
"T heartily concur in the recommen
dations," writes the President in his
- third special message of the session.
The commission has been investigat
ing issuance of stock by i railroad com
panies for more than a year. It de
clares, that Federal incorporation of
railroads must come but does not rec
ommend that it be instituted now.
! Railroad rates are considered only
collaterally by the commission.
The chief recommendation of the
i commission is that all railroads
1 should be forced to report to the In-
i terstate . Commerce Commission either
prior to or within one year after any
securities are issued, complete state
ments of their stock and bond liabili
ties, issued and unissued, special pre
ferences, pledges, receipts and expen
dltures, and the value of physical as
sets. Fine and imprisonment are urg
ed for failure to file these reports.
The commission further urges that
the Interstate Commerce commission
be. given power to make "physical
valuations" of railroad property
whenever it is necessary.
Weather Indications
(Special from United Press.)
New Haven, Dec, 11. Forecast:
Rain latef tonight or on Tuesday.
Colder Tuesday, moderate to brisk
south and southwest winds.
A disturbance over Lake Michigan
extends, this morning to the west
gulf coast. It has caused rain dur
ing the last 24 hours from the lake
region southward over .the central
valleys to the gulf. Moderate tem
peratures prevail in the districts east
of the Mississippi river out an ex
tensive area of high pressure over
the western states is causing a de
creased fall in temperature west of
the Mississippi river in the rear of
the storm. The area of high pres
sure over the Atlantic States for sev
eral days past is slowly moving out
to sea and will be followed eastward
by the disturbance in the central dis
trict. This will probably cause light
rain in this vicinity tonight and
Tuesday, followed by clearing and
colder Tuesday or Tuesday afternoon
and night.

YULETIDE PERIOD
OF TORTURE
A. STORY
OF A LITTLE SHOP
... GIRL.
Her Struggle With the Late Christmas
Buyers that Might Easily Have
Been Spared
t
(Exclusive Service The Survey Press
Bureau.)
"Shop early. Buy your Christ
mas presents EARLY early In
the day and early in December.
That will be your biggest gift of
the holidays to the workers be
hind the counters and on the de
livery wagons."
This slogan has been made famous
by the National Consumers' League
which, actuated , by humanitarian
reasons, has fought to modify the un
necessary hardships Incident to Christ
mas, shopping. For two weeks before
Christmas most department stores do
a "capacity business" and the pressure
is intensified at every point. Authen
tic records from "the Uvea of clerks,
delivery boys and wagon drivers show
that as a result the season of Christ
mas festival and of charity for the
lame, the halt, and the blind reduces
to illness and exhaustion the young
and faithful who serve us, seen and
unseen.
A kind of meannes in human rela
tions was witnessed by Miss Johnson,
an inquirer for the Consumers' Leaguo,
who worked in one of the stores dur
ing the week, of Christmas good-will.
Her actual experiences are told in a
volume entitled "Making Both Ends
Meet" by Sue Ainslea and Edith
Wyatt, of which the Macndjlan Com
pany is the publisher.
"The 'rush' had begun when Miss
Johnson was transferred in this Christ
mas week from the neckware to the
muffler department on. the first floor
of one of the cheaper stores. ' All the
girls stood all day long from eight to
twelve and from one to eight at night
on the first days; from one at noon to
ten and eleven at night as the season
progressed; and, on the last dreadful
nights, from noon to the following
midnight. The girls had 35 cents sup
per money. v Except for that, all this
extra labor was unpaid for.
The work was incessant. The girls
were nervous, hateful, spiteful with
one another. The manager, a beauti
ful and extremely rough girl of nine
teen, swore constantly at all of them.
The customers were gabbing, insistent,
unreasonable from morning to evening,
from evening to midnight. Behind the
counter, with the advance of the day,
the place became an- inferno of ner
vous exhaustion and exasperation. In
the two weeks of Miss Johnson's ser
vice one customer once thanked her;
and one tipped her five cents for the
rapid , return of -a parcel. Both these
acts of consideration took place in the
morning. Miss Johnson said that this
was fortunate for her, as, at one word
of ordinary consideration toward the
end of her long days' ' work, she
thought she must have burst into
tears.
There was a little bundler in the de
partment, Catriona Mai a testa, a white,
hungry-looking little North Italian of
fourteen with a thin chin and a dark
shadowed, worled face. She had an
adored sick sister of four, besides six
other younger brothers and sisters,
and a worshipped mother, to whom she
gave every cent of her wages of three
dollars and a half a week. An older
brother, a day laborer, paid the rent
and provided food for all of them.
Every other family expense was met
by Catriona's three dollars and a half,
so that she was in the habit of spend
only five cents for her own lunch, and
on, the nights of over-time, five cents
for her own dinner, in order to take
home the extra thirty cents; and
every day she looked whiter and older.
At the beginning of the week before
Christmas, the store, raised Catriona's
wage to four dollars. Her mother
told her she might have the extra half
dollar for herself for Christmas.
Though Catriona had worked for some
months, this was the first money of
her own she had ever had. "With
pride she told the department how it
was to be spent. She "was going to
surprise her mother with a new waist
for Christmas, a waist that Catriona
had seen in the store marked down
to forty-nine cents. A ten per cent
discount was allowed to employees, so
that the waist would cost forty-five
'""ts. With the remaining five cents

Catriona would buy her sick Rosa a
doll. All her life Rosa had wanted a
doll. Now, at least, she could have
one. , '
On the day when she received the
money, Catriona kept it close at hand,
in a little worn black leather purse, ' in
a shabby bag hanging from her arm,
and not out of sight for an instant.
Her purchases were to be made in
the three-quarters of an hpur allowed
for supper. r The time Catriona con
sumed in eating her five cent meal
was never long, so that, even allow
ing for prolonged purchasing, her ab
sence of an hour was strange.
"D your soul, where in hell
have you been all this time, Catie?"
the manager screamed at her, angrily,
without glancing at her, when she
came back at last.
Catriona looked more anxious and
white than ever before. Her face
was stained with weeping. "I lost
my purse," she said in a dazed, un
steady voice. "It was gone when I
opened my bag in the lunch room.
I've looked for it everywhere."
There was a' sudden breathless
change In the air of the department.
You could have heard a pin drop.
"Better go down o the basement
and wash your face," said the man
ager, awkwardly, with unbelievable
gentleness.
"Well," she continued suddenly, the
minute Catriona was out of ear-shot,
"I'm not. so poor but I can help to
make that up.'.' She took a dollar bill
from her pocketbook. Everyone con
tributed something, though several
girls went without their supper, for
this purpose, and one girl walked
home four miles after midnight. Al
together they could give nearly ten
dollars.'
. The manager sidled awkwardly . to
ward Catroina, when she came back
from washing her face. "Here, kid,"
she mutter sheepishly, pushing the
money into the little girl's hand,
Catriona, pale and dazed,' looked up
at her looked at the money, with a
shy excitement and happiness dawn-i
ing in her eyes, xnen sne cnea again
with excitement and - joy, and every
one laughed, and sent her off again to
wash her face.
That night everything was different
in the department. There had been a
real miracle of transfiguration. The
whole air of intercourse was changed.
All the girls were gentle and dignified
with each other. Catriona's eyes
sparkled with pleasure. Her careworn
air was gone. She was a child again.
She had never had any physical love
liness before; but on that night hun
dreds of passing shoppers looked with
attention at the delight and beauty
of her face.
On the next day everything went on
as before. The girls snapped at each
other -and jostled each other. The
beautiful manager swore. One girl
came, looking so ill that Miss Johnson
was terrified. .
"Can't you stop, Kitty? You look
so sick. For heaven's sake, go home
and rest." .
"I can't afford to go home."
Cross and snappish as the girls were,
they managed to spare Kitty, and to
stand in front of her to conceal her
idleness from the floor walker, and
give her a few minutes' occasional
rest sitting down. She went through
the first hours of the morning as best
she might, though clearly under pres
sure of sharp suffering. But at about
10 the floor walker, for whom it must
be said that he was responsible for
the sales and general presentability of
the department, saw her sitting down.
"Why aren't you busy?" he called.
"Get up."
At midnight on, Christmas eve; as
the still crowd of girls walked wanly
out of the great store into the bril
liant New York street, some one said,
"How are you, Kitty?"

A MATCH WORKER.
John Werner came to Amfrica
from Germany and from August, 1907,
untij December, 1908, he worked in
an Ohio match factory. In. Germany,
as in practically all civilized countries
except the United States, the govern
ment does not permit the use of pois
onous phosphorus in the manufac
ture .. of matches It has long been
known that where this deadly poison
is1 used a terrible disease called
"phossy jaw'1 afflicts the workers.
The government of the United States
and of the several states, however.
I still permits the use of the poison, for
wnicn mere are harmless substitutes.
The poison is a little cheaper, '
But John Werner came- to the
United States for citizenship. After
working one-year and four months
in an American match factory he
contracted "phossy jaw." His teeth
dropped out; hia jaw bones decayed.
He suffered excruciating agony. In
spite of two- surgical operations in
April, - 1909, he is condemned to a
miserable existence on liquid foods.
Still able to drag himself about, he
is not strong enough to work.
John's Wife took -in washing until
crippled with rheumatism: Then, with
the help of relatives in the old coun
try, she and their ' one little girl re
turned to Germany. John. Werner,'
helpless and alone, then isued the
match corporation, under the em
ployers' liability law, for damages.
The corporation through its -attorneys
denied "that it was guilty of
carelessness, negligence, or improper
conduct." John Werner did not get
one penny.
Now, with his face in a bandage
tied in a knot at the crown of his
head, he drags himself up and down
the streets of this match factory
town, bearing the following petition:
"I John Werner, a native of Ger
many, who came to this country for
citizenship, laboring in one of Ash
land's manufacturing . establishments,
contracted a disease of the bones of
the face. I am unable to work. Have
no means. By aid or kindred in the
fatherland, wife and child have gone
to the old country, and I ask aid
from the people of Ashland to get
myself into physical condition to
make the trip and expense of the
trip to join them in the fatherland."
During the past eix months, while
living alone in a shed near the rail
road track, he has collected with
this appeal nearly twenty dollars. The
characteristic odor of this occupa
tional disease forces everyone to shun
him. He can eat no solid food. Phyr
sicians frankly state that his case is
"hopeless."
The story of John Werner is mere
ly typical. In spite -of the most ex
traordinary sanitary precautions,
match workers in our country still
suffer and die with this loathsome
disease, and there are many others
to whom early death would have been
welcome. Absolute prohibition of the
poison is the only remedy.
"Phossy jaw" is an unnecessary
disease! Congress by passing the
Esch bill can stop the . use of the
deadly phosphorus. The Association
for Labor Legislation appeals to all
to urge its passage upon their repre
sentatives in Congress.
