; REDUCED TAXATION AND
" THE PENSION ACT.
' There are two topics in the President's
message which are closely , related, viz. :
the section relating to the " reduction of
taxation and that which estimates the
expenditures under the Arrears of Pen-?
sions'act. The latter is in substance
the same with the exhibit already made
by Commissioner Dudley. It is a sim
ple problem of mathematics. The aver-
High way Vobbery, considered as a fine
art, is under review just now, because
of many recent occurrences. One of the
latest was the ''Conveyance." as Shake
speare so neatly put3 it, Jof diamond ear
rings from a lady on the threshold of
her own domicile, in broad daylight, in
a fashionable and well-frequented neigh
hood in Brooklyn. .The delicate mani
pulators hurt the lady's feelings but
they abstracted the brilliant pendants
without inflicting the tiniest scratch.
Therejyas a policeman .on the corner
but he was, as. many of them are,, too fat
to have any chance of catching the skill
ful youths. 1 suppose you have read
Mark Twain's "Innocents Abroad."
The lady was the wife of one of them.
Perhaps that accounts for her misfortune.
The stripiculturists have been hold
ing a convention, and among their usual
long-haired and objectionable doctrines,
which as they unmistakeably tend to
develop "cranks" and Guiteauism, gen
erally might, I think, receive at least as
much attention as poolrooms and faro
halls. It's all very well to talk about
heredity and base comparisons on the
methods of breeding horses, cows, sheep
and pigs, but there , are , differences , in
human beings. Real scientists can't ex
plain it, and don't try to, and the bogus
root ought to be severely suppressed.
They, haven't made any. improvements
in. the good, old: way, of courtihip , and
consequences. ; Good, fathers don't al

Merrill of Swanton and others are mak
ing arrangements to establish a butter
and cheese factory at St. Albans point,
iiear Gov. Smith's place. It is proposed
to erect a factory capable of , working up
the milk from six hundred cows.
The St. Albans Messenger says that Col.
Albert Clarke, ; formerly proprietor of
that paper, hs been offered the position
of managing editor of one of the Boston
daily papers, but declines it, as he has
found the opportunity to purchase a liter
ary paper which promises to be : less la
borious and more profitable.

a challenge in behalf of Edward Drecker

United State
Party AscENDENCY.i-Six years ago
the house of representatives was organ
ized with a democratic, majority, after
having beeq held by the republican par
ty for sixteen years. , Now it is restored
to republican control by a bare majority.
The senate, also., is now republican by a
still more, precarious tenure. At each
congressional election the democratic
majority was reduced, until now it has
disappeared. The. party made, a bad
use of its power, and the people, after
successive warnings, withdrew their con
fidence.. The republican party, has now
its turn. As,it deals wisely or reckless
ly with the public interests, it will gain
in strength or lose its power, over : the
government
The present congress promises to be
more prolific in bills than any of its
predecessors. Some 700 bills were
placed upon the calendars of the two
houses during the 4Gth congress, but on
Tuesday, the first bill day in the House,
781 were introduced, while 850 were in
troduced in the senate last week. The
call of states for bills were not complet
ed in the House, Tuesday, and will be
resumed on Friday,1 and by the end of
the week there will probably be as many
as 2500 bills placed upon the ' calenrs
of the two houses. The great 1 majority
of these bills are of no national'' import
ance at all, and in a great many cases
they will never be 'seriously considered
or serve any other purpose than lumber
ing up the calendars'. !
, "Perley" describes the new. speaker
as "a good specimen of the Garfield
type of ; Western,,. war statesmen who
have worked their own way,., up in,;the
world. He is of medium hight, sturdi
ly built,. with a well-shaped head, and a
ruddy ; complexion,. ,not .whisky-tinted,
but the hearty glow of a. genial, disposi
tion, overflowing spirita and a. mind ac
customed to : free utterance, -j His gray
eyes twinkle and shine, Lis silvered hair
carelessly thrown back from his high
forehead, and he bas a full grizzly beard
. in which a humming-bird might build
ber nest.,;, Reared on a- farm , bis .ideas
were formed by communing with nature,
rather than by poring over books, and in
politics as it was. in the war he means
business. Mrs: Keifer and two of their
children, a boy and a girl,, arrived in
time .to see him elected and sworn in.
the act is $1350. There are about
197,000 claims which have been or will
be allowed under the act ; and these,, at
an average of $1350 each, make a round
sum of $260,000,000: necessary for first
payments. Deducting $15,000,000 as
an estimate of saving in cases where
claimants die, leaving no persons enti
tled to .succeed . to . their pensions, we
have $236,ob6.6ooi. as the amount to be
paid. But there are 38,500 cases filed
since June 30 1880, and now pending.
86 per cent, of which the , President es
timates will be allowed. . These . do. not
involve the payment of. arrears and- are
not taken into the President's estimate ;
but their aggregate amount must be
heavy. This enormous outlay has, as
we have intimated, a very direct bear
ing upon what the President has to say
concerning t the reduction . of taxation.
People who have been disturbed by the
large excess of Government revenues
over expenditures, and have been agi
tated over the apprehension that we
were about to ruin ourselves in a . some
what novel manner, by paying our debts
too rapidly, have based their arguments
and their apprehensions on the existing
state of things, without taking into the
account the enormous : drain . upon the
revenues which is to. be made ' by the
payments under, . the . Pension . Act.
What might be. possible, if we had. not
this load .to carry, is not possible now,
and the President was wise in declining
to recommend any. immediate reduction
in the taxes on spirits and tobacco, which
yield the great . bulk of our internal
revenue. The other taxes, the repeal of
which he recommends, may be remitted
without serious loss but these sources
of revenue cannot, be safely .abridged
until , the outlay called for by the Pen
sions Act is met The tax is one that
is borne by the customer ; it is, , in a
sense,: purely a voluntary tax ; and any
one who considers it onerous can release
himself from - its operations by abstain
ing from the: use of the articles , taxed.
To remit any . considerable portion of
this tax at the demand of the , whisky
and' tobacco interests,,; at; a, time when
we are confronted by . the ; necessity, of
making enormous outlays which cannot
even' as yet be accurately estimated,
would be the height of folly.-r-teMrBd.
The unfortunate situation of Irish af
fairs does not seem to change for the
better. " The popular feeling seems to
be growing more and more favorable to
the land act; yet'many of the people are
actually intimidated from' accepting the
benefits to be derived from the act, by a
certain element led by" selfish and ' de
singing demagogues. Whether the cpes
tion of refusing to pay rent be right or
wrohs it is certain that those ' who re
fuse to pay rent have no right to intim
idate or compel others to act with' them.
If a tenant desires to pay bis rent it is a
monstrous wrong for the "no rent" ele
ment to attempt to prevent him by vio
leuce and intimidation. It is pretty
fair proof that some of the leaders of the
Irish agitation are working for personal
forty or fifty cows. Everything is man
aged on business principles, and the re
sult is he is a successful farmer. By this
refrigerator process poultry can be kept
sound and sweet till July, when chickens
begin to' arrive in the market.
