The Louisville Journal.
W a ara not among thoae poraona or jour
Bab that hara rendered idolatrous homaga to
tba Louifville Journal, or ibj editor, (Jeorg
U. Pientica. W have been read to give
that per all due credit for having itood
boldly for the Union and for battling
against the rebels, bat hare not published
column ol fulsome adulation of its editor
for doing What wa simply the part of an
honest and loyal maa. If we had, we should
be heartily ashamed of it now. While we
admired the boldness and true eloquence
with which he dealt ponderous blows at the
invading rebels, we did not forget that he
denounotd the President's call for 75,000
troops last spring, and joined with the trait
orous Governor in saying that Kentucky
would sot furnish her quota. We also re
membered that the Journal was an earnest
supporter and upholder of the pretended neu
trality of Kentucky, by which position, upon
her part, the rebels were induced to enter
fha Slate, and that it only came out boldly in
fcvor ot fighting for the Union at all when
the rebels had actually invaded the State
and ware threatening Louisville. It oppo
sition to the spirit of Fremont's proclamation
we do not here notice, (as that was natural
in a paper published in a slave State) except
so far as its articles showed that it considered
alaverr of, at least, as great value as the
Union.
Sut it is for its comments upon the Presi
dent's message that we especially devote
space in our columns at this time. These
emments are unjust, unwise, unpatriotic and
unpardonable. The? are ol a kind that we
( should expect to see in the Richmond Exam
Uer, the Memphis Appeal or the Charleston
Kercury, but not in a paper that professes
to asr fairness or loyalty. We use the last
L word advisedly, lor no article which has been
puluiahed in all the loyal States daring the
' war, has been more full of opposition to the
. Government. Along with this hostility to
, the Government is an overweening vanity
aed self righteousness that is most offensive,
' bat which is a mere secondary objection be
side the greater one in this instance.
That we may show the justice of these
i ', comments we make a few extracts. In quot
ing Mr. Lincoln's very moderate views upon
the slavery question,tbe Journal sees in
- them
- "indirect and unmanly concurrence in the
policy asserted recently by CoL Cochrane
- ' and approved by Secretary Cameron to the
. : morUncauon and ahame ol every loyal man
' in Kentucky.
So that it is no matter what loyal men in
l 'Ohl), Kesr York or New England may
" think; no matter whether those views were
L. , wise or otherwise; no matter whether they
"' received the sanction of all the Cabinet or
: not, they cause mortification to Kentuckians,
, ; that is, to the Louisville Journal and hence
they are "unmanly." In further comment
ing upon the remark of the President that
' he will consider any more stringent laws
- which Congress may adopt, relative to the
. disposal of the property (and slaves) ol
, rebels, the Journal uses these remarkable
words, remarkable for their lurking treasoi
What is to be done? There is but one
; thing to be done. The adoption of the ex
treae measurea contemplated must be pre
vented, or the nation is swallowed up. Of
this we do not feel a shadow of doubt. But
. how can the adoption of these measures be
' prevented? There appears to us to be three
modes, in either of which the all important
prevention may be attained. 1. The pros
1 ; perUy of our arms and of our cause general
' ly in a great degree that will put all pre.
texts whatever for a resort to extreme meas
' sores out of the question. 2. The awaken
ing of the conservative sentiment and en
lightened loyalty ot the country, and bring
ing bkhb to oear on tne President witn a
' force which he cannot as an honest and ra
tional man withstand. 3. The resolution of
. the Commander-in-Chief in the field, and of
lug principal associates in command, to sur
render their swords rather than link them
''--with the infamy of such measures. The
. first of these three modes is for the most part
beyond the reach of the people. We have
' fkiih in it, bnt it . should not be relied on
blindly. The last mode is our last hope, if
, everything else iajls, this may save us. If it
does not, we are irretrievably lost as a na
tion.' . ' - Here the Journal directly and unequivo
cally put slavery above the Union and Con
stitution, and says directly to the officers of
the Union army, "if you are called upon, by
tha emergencies of war, or by the voice ot
"! your superiors, to lay a hand upon slavery
that it may nUl and the Union stand, then
It to your duty to refuse to obey, and to
, break your swords and abandon the army to
it fate in the face of the enemy, caring for
.. nothing, preserving nothing but slavery."
U this is not aiding the enemy and tending
to destroy the efficiency of the Union army,
theft it would bo difficult to find words that
r would do it; and if the ten thousand Ken
tucky soldiers take the Journal for their
guide, we would not give much for their ser
- vices hereafter. But that paper not only
point the way to insubordination and dis
' trust, but says, u this task can be performed
. successfully." Of course it can, and it Is
... only necessary that half a hundred papers
. throughout the North and semi-loyal South.
. era Elates, follow the lead of the Journal
' for one month, to perform it . But thank
, Gol, there will not be half a dozen influ-
eoiial journals to do this.
;j Tb Journal would have "the loyal men
of the South rife op as one man, and tell the
President he know not what he doe." AnS
we would have the President risu up and
tell the men of both South and North, loyd
and disloyal, that he doe know what be
doe, and if they are not ready to hold
the country above - faction, loyalty above
' neutrality," and the Unien above the con
venience and profit ot the slaveholding rebel,
their advice and wrath will be alike disre
garded. We have ddvjted so mnch space to this
matter, because the Journal la probably seen
more by our soldiers In Kentucky than any
other paper, and Northern presses sho'tld
endeavor to counteract the evil influences
of such article a this on. To show that
the Journal is not, (as it seem to imagine)
the mouthpiece of all Kentucky, we copy
the following paragraph from the Frankfort
Commonwealth, published at the Capital of
that StaUx :
The Louisville Journal of yesterday morn
ing contained an article ou the President's
message wuicu mun create a universal icei
ing of astouishuient and regret in tlie mind
of everv well wisher of his country. The
article is detormed by a vein of ridiculous
vanity, coupled with an assumption ot re
markable influence, which the writer fondly
believe flows from the point of his pen
whenever it come in contact with oaper.-
Aside from the wretched taste of criti 'lsm, it
is exceedingly ill-timed, and unjust to the
fresiilent.
The Treasury Report.
The report of Secretary Chase will be
looked for with at least equal anxiety to
that displayed for the President's Kessage.
The New York Tribune professes to have
the substance of what it will contain, as fol
lows :
It will, as we are assured, be a thorough
exposition of the financial condition and
prospects of the country, and will recom
mend measures of the gravest importance.
It is understood that the leading feature
of his report will be a recommendRticn of a
tax upon bank notes, which will have the
iffect to remove them from circulation, and
to supply in their place the currency of the
United States. The plan of the Secretary
meets, as we are assured, with tha cordial
approbation of the banks and capitalists, so
that no difficulty witn the moneyed inter
est will grow out of the sulstitutiox It is
probable that the question will be raised as to
the constitutionality of banks erected under
State laws, and their right to affect the value
of gold and silver. The advantages o
currency for which the faith of the nation,
with all its resources, stand pledged, over
one wnicn depends upon the laws ct thirty
four different States, and upon the faith of
more than sixteen hundred co-operations,
will be urged.
Secretary Chase will take ground In favor
of the confiscation of the property of rebels
as a means of revenue, but will boll that
slaves must form an exception, inasmuch as
tne National Government cannot become
Ue owner of slaves. He favors their release
from the authority of rebel masters, how
ever, and their employment in various use
ful occupations, with compensation, which
shall render them a more profitable class of
population than they are in their present
condition as slaves. ,
We are informed that an additional duty
upon tea, sugar, and coffee will be recom
mended, and also an excise duty upen all
distilled liquors, still-", Ac., and upon tobac
co. A tax upon bank notes, evidences of
debt, and upon conveyances, will also be
recommended.
The Secretary estimates that the public
debt will amount to about $800,000,003.
Items from Port Royal.
THE REBELS BURNING COTTON.
Four days before the Vanderbilt sailed,
gnu-boat went up one of the rivers in the
vicinity of IPort Royal and remained over
night. On the passage up vast quantities of
cotton were discovered stored realy for gin
ning. The gnn-boat penetrated for several
miles. No rebels were discovered, b'lt on
the return, the cotton which bad been no
ticed was found on fire ; and as fer as could
be seen in all directiors, dense smoie rose in
clouds, indicating that an organised effort to
burn all the cotton, and probably ctber prop
erty, had been made. The rebels, it
thought, were under the impression that the
vessel bad come tor the purpose of sermg it.
However, not a single white man vras seen.
The reconnoisancea have reverJed the fact
that vast quantities ot cotton are stored upon
the numerous small creeks and inlets, within
easy reach of our forces. It is, in nearly all
cases, ready tor ginning.
THE FORTIFICATIONS OF HILTON HEAD.
Nearly the entire force of Gen. Sherman
yet remains on Hilton Head Island. The
entrenchments in progress are rrpijly no
preaching completion. They begin on the
mainland Bide of the island, a mile nnd a
half from Fort Walker, and are about three
miles in length. . The works consist ot a
ditch, with a breastwork, and wi'.l, when
completed, entirely protect the island from
any attack which could be made from the
mainland. The work is performed under the
superintendence of Capt. Gilmore, of the
Engineer Corps, formerly stationed on Gov
ernor's Island.
The improvements heretofore reported as
in progress at Hilton Head are going on ex
peditiously. Koads are building: and the
wharf, when the carpenters and laborers to
be sent from this city arrive, will soon Le
completed.
CONTRABANDS AT WORK.
It is certainly very amusing to observe
these contrabands engaged at what, in a
measure, has been misnamed "work." Ia
order to transport a bale of hay a distance of
from twenty to thirty yards it ta; about
eighteen or twenty laborers mm and ;boys
who perform the operation somewhere in
the neighborhood of twenty minutes. First,
one will give it a turn over, roll his body on
it, dropdown on his elbowaj and have a quiet
grin for several seconds. Then it will be
passed to the next one, who proves to be a
perfect genius in the art ot iiritaticn ; and
so on it goes through the whole gang. At
times the gangs will suddenly grow small
and beautifully less in censequence cf some
of the laborers having decided to anuse
themselves a la Heenan, others baring start
ed off on foot races, and more resolved on
getting up an impromptu "circus.
Just about this juncture a sergeant nay be
seen re-collecting the scapegoats by dint of a
resort to summary expedients and a very
powerful use of his lungs. Not enfreouent-
ly air. Contraband is mode aware of the feet
that there i an "all seeing" eye, by havine a
brick pass his legs with considerable rapidity
at a distance rather too close for personal
comfort. When I doscribe how a bale of
hay is unloaded, the description will serve as
a very safe criterion by which to.'udge the
manner in which every thing elsa is removed
and stored away. It is not unusual to see
half a dozen negroes wheeling a hand-cart
generally with nothing in it; a coal cart
backed np in a heap of lumber al-iost off
toe dock, or into tone other cart or wagon,
rather than where it is wanted; eight or
ten "darkeys" removing a stick of lumber,
while the same number are engtged in warm
ing their feet or dancing a jig; little ebonies
hurrahing for some notability in the hope of
getting a penny from a passing c33er; more
little blacks playing soldier, scamnarinir aft.r
a band of music, or throwic j dast; and
wencoos swaggering, gunning, and capering
by th roadside, or coquetting with their
fellows.

The Case of Rev. George Gordon.
The United State ) In the District Court of
v. i-Ohio. Tried at lb fio-
George Gordon, j Timber Term, 1861.
This was a prosecution for a violation ot
the 00th Sec. of th A'' ior the punishment
of crime, found in Brightly' Statutes, page
112, and passed April 30, 1790. The section
punishes any person who shall knowingly
and willfully obstruct, resist or oppose any
officer of the United States, in serving or at
tempting to serve or execute any writ,
process, warrant, &&, issued by any person
authorized to issue the same, by Imprison
ment, not exceeding twelve months, and by
fine not exceeding three hundred dollars.
The defendant was indicted at the November
Term, 1860.
The testimony on the trial established, be
yond a rational doubt, that on the l'-'th day
ot September, 18C0, three men from Ken
tucky came to Cincinnati, and made affidavit
before U. S. Commissioner Newhall, that
three persons owing them service and labor
In Kentucky, had fled, and were then in the
State "of Ohio. They procured three war
rants and placed them in the hands of Mar
shal Siflbrd of the Southern District, liar
shal Sifford called to his assistance two ot
his deputies and two or three other men be
side the Kentuckians, and the company on
the 10th of September left for the vicinity of
Iberia, where they understood the slaves were.
A short distance from Iberia the company
left the cars, and soon after, under the orders
and directions of Marshal Sifford, they sepa
rated, Joseph L. Barber, one of the Deputy
Marshals, taking a warrant for Granderson
Martin, and taking two of the company with
him, went as he was directed, to the house of
James Hammond, where it was supposed
Martin was. When he arrived at the house
it had begun to grow dark. He knocked at
the door, and a lady came to it, of whom
Barber enquired if a colored boy was there
by the name of Martin. He was told he was
not. He then enquired If such a person had
not been there, and was answered in the
affirmative. He asked where he then was,
and th lady said she did not know, and
3he did she would not toll. Barber told her
he had a warrant for Martin's irrest, and it
was his daty to be satisfied be was not there.
The lady lighted a candle, gave it to him,
and told him he could search the house,
which Barber did slightly, bat to his satis
faction, no other person entering the house,
Mr. Barber and his associates then left, and
went back to a point on the railroad, some
mile and a-half, where they by agreement,
were to report themselves.
Soon after they reached the railroad, and
while waiting there for the arrival of the
other companies, men began to collect and
enquire their business, accusing them of being
robbers and thieves. Mr. Barber assured
them that they were not robbers or thieves,
but that they were on legitimate business.
There was in company with Mr. Barber at
this time a Mr. Benick, of Columbus. The
crowd now numbered some fifteen or twenty,
and grew more and more boisterous and
excited. Mr. Barber, thinking bis safety
required it, now told them that he was
Deputy United State Marshal, that he had
warrant to serve, explained the nature of it,
and demanded their protection and assistance.
At this they became more excited than ever,
and began to threaten to hang them, the
crowd all the time increasing. The crowd
now seized Barber and Benick, and took
them some half a mile from where they were,
and off the railroad track, to the edge of
piece of woods. After looking for a suitable
tree from which to hang them, and boasting
that a halter had been procured for the pur
pose, the crowd changed their minds and con
eluded to shoot them. Barber and Benick
were now separated some forty feet, and
held and searched. On Mr. Barber they
found a wallet, containing his private
papers and about $24 in money, his pistol,
a small Bowie-knife, his warrant and a let
ter from Mr. Sifford. To secure the wallet,
they tore the pocket from hi pantaloons.
The crowd then demanded that Barber and
Benick should kneel with their faces in op
posite directions and some thirty paces
apart, declaring that they would shoot
them. Renick obeyed, but Barber refused.
They then stripped off Barber s overcoat,
dress coat, vest and shirt, leaving his under-
shirt In this condition they seized him
and by force put him neon his knees. A file
of three or tour men was then drawn up in
front of him, and orders given to cock their
guns, make ready, and take aim; all of
which was gone through with. It was then
suggested that they should not shoot them,
but that they should be whipped uutil they
told where the colored boy was. Barber as
sured them that he did not know, that he
had seen nothing of him, and did not know
that any had been arrested. Two or three
men seized each of Mr. B.'s hands, pulling
bis arms out at full length, and two colored
men, one a very large athletic man, with
large limbs cut from the trees proceeded to
lash him in the most brutal manner, whip
ping him until the small branches were
worn from the limb and the colored men
exhausted, and Mr. Barber, larcerated and
bleeding, having upon him several gashes
one and a half inches in length, and his
right arm, with which h attempted at time
to avertthe blows, so bruised that kthe next
day it was swollen to twice its usual size.
Daring this Hogging the muzzle of a gun
was thrust anst his side with such vio
lence that from the effect he has not re
covered.
Mr. Benick during this time was receiv
ing similar treatment at th hands of an
other portion of the company, though not
severe. Barber and Bennick were now
ordered to their feet, and commenced dress-
sing, when Mr. Gordon gave one of the color.
ed men a whip, saying, "they have not got
enough yet, give them some more," and
some twelve or fifteen blows were well laid
on. The company then proceeded with scis
sors to shear the heads of Barber and Ben
ick, and in this made thorough work. Mr.
Gordon then administered an obligation to
them to the effect that they would never
again vote the Democratic ticket, or be en
gaged in arresting a fugitive (lave. He then
lectured them Irani five to ten minutes
on the enormity of their crime, and
assured them that they had been for
tunate in falling into the hands of the
better portion of community, stating if they
had fallen Into the hands of the Boughs they
would have fared much worse. Barber and
Benick were then, about one o'clock at night,
permitted to put on their clothes. Barber
asked that his money, papers,and other things
taken from him, be given to him. This was
not done, some one remarking that he had
no business there, and that he did not deserve
them. During th time after the company
left the railroad to the close Mr. Gordon was
present, actively engaged In tbtte proceed
ings, and when hi name was mentioned
cautioned those present not to use names.
During the most of the time there were from
30 to 60 men prestnt. Boon after this trans
action Mr. Gordon left and was understood
to be in Canada. I think In April last, he
came to me and voluntarily entered securi-
tie for hi appearance at Court. Until after
hi trial no bond but hi own was required.
I do not say that the foregoing is literally
true. But I do say that it is a faithful nar
rative of what the testimony disclosed on the
trial, and that there was no testimony which
in the slightest degree tended to contradict
It or modify It effect. And for the truth of
this I refer to tha Court, the Jurors, the De
fendant' Attornies, and every other person
who listened to the trial.
This is the cue I inheirited from my pre
decessor, with the recorded evidence taken
before the Grand Jury. I eiamined the tes
timony. I thought it ought to be prosecuted.
I tried, without unusual zeal or resort to un
usual technical or dishonorable means, to pro
cure a conviction. The jury was made up of
eleven Republicans and one Democrat.
The charge of the Court was most impartial
as was admitted by Defendant' Attornies.
The jury without a dissenting joic at once
nronounced the defendant guilty. The
Court sentenced him to one half the impris
onment provided by the statutes, ff this
sentence was too severe it is difficult to imag
ine for what kind of a case the balance of
the imprisonment was provided. The mis
apprehension of the facts and perversion of
the testimony, as well as the reflections cast
upon all who have been officially connected
with this case, have seemed to me to render it
proper that I should make this statement at
some length. I leave it with the single re
gret that there should have been occasion for
its existence.
R. F. PAINE.
Cotton in Illinois.
We have before spoken of the successful
experiments which have been made to raise
cotton in lower Illinois. The Chicago Tri
bune has information from an unquestioned
source that fiv thousand acres in that
State will be planted with cotton the coming
year. As it has been shown that it is the
prospective, and not present want of cotton
which alarms the English manufacturers
(they having on hand a six months' stock
and a nearly equal amount being expected
from India) we can look with comparative
complacency upon the burning of their cot
ton by the Carolina planters, and wait the
incoming of the Illinois orop with which to
keep English mills supplied.

CLEVELAND WEEKLY LEADER
WILL COUMKXJK J AMI) AH V let, I St! J
For Bttvbnleen years the Leaoks has re
newed its weekly visits to the firesides of
its friends throughout the West in general,
anl Northern Ohio in particular. Improved
facilities for printing have enabl ed Its proprie
tors to reduce the price till it has become a
successful competitor with the leading week
ly papers of New York.
The coming year will be tbe turning year
of the century. Every month will be crowd
ed with important events, and every week
will develope some new and startling phase
of the
Great SlaYehoIders' Kebelllon!
It is unnecessary tor as to dilate on the
Importance of one's taking a newspaper at
this time when onr country is passing
through one of the moat terrible and gigan
tic civil wars the civilized world has ever
seen. It is still more needless, perhaps, for
as to urge the advantages of having a good
HOME PAPER
To keep ns posted in the Dews from the
seats of war, where three quarter of a mil
lion of our countrymen are arrayed in arms
agaiaBt each other to decide whether Free
dom or slavery snail predominate In our
land. Every aeighborhood, and almost
every family haj one or more of its mem
bera In the army, and the movement of the
divisions will be a matter of intense interest
10 all. We shall take the utmost pains to
give particular accounts of all engagements,
And Publish tbe Lists of Killed
and Wounded,
And in fact not omit any information
that san interest the very large number of
readers of the Weekly Leader.
Notwithstanding the war monopolizing
necessarily so large a share of our columns,
we intend to devote a liberal space to the
details of other news of the day, and also
not omit the literary and miscellaneous
matter which has always made the Lsadib
a pleasant companion in tbe family circle.
The Leadib will unceasingly advocate the
right and the duty of the Government to
protect and defend itself) and to employ nn.
limited means for the accomplishment of that
end. It will, as it ever has done, wage de
termined war upon whatever is opposed to
the principle of civil and Religious Liberty,
The Proprietors of the Lkadsb have made
definite arrangements for tbe year 1862, by
which they trust the paper will become even
more of a necessity to the people of Northern
Ohio than ever before. Full telegraphic re
ports (for which they pay more than anj
other paper in Ohio out of Cincinnati,) wil
be given. By the 1st of January neit the
wires will be stretched across the continent
to the Pacific thus giving ns
Dally News Erom California
Utah, Oregon, Pike's Peak,
and Pacific Countries !
With all the9e additional advantages, the
