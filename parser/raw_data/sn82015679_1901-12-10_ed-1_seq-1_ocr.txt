DENIAL n' ARKANSAS JONKS OF al
legeii ulterior motives.
Mr. lionr f Opinion thnt Neither of
the South Cm roll nia n Are En
titled to Seat In the Senate.
WASHINGTON. Dec. O.-The Senate
chamber was the scene of a highly dra
matic episode to-day, when Senator Till
man, of South Carolina, challenged his
colkarue, Senator McLaurin, to resign with
him on the spet, in order, to use his own
language, that they might bo able to "wash
th'.ir dirty linen at home." Mr. McLaurin
did not take up the gauge.
The Incident to-day was the direct sequel
of th very bitter controversy which arose
between the senators in South Carolina
last fi ring. Mr. McLaurin rose to a ques
tion of personal privilege to-day and pro
ceeded to explain what he charged was a
conspiracy to discredit him in his own
State tor acts and views which did not
m'"t the approval of certain Democratic
1 -rulers. He declared that he was being hu
miliated, and. according to public prints,
was to be excluded from the Democratic
caucus because he had acted on certain
puMic Issues In a way which he considered
was for the best interests of the country
and the people of his State. He announced
himself a believer In the old Democracy,
and. after denouncing the new Democracy
leaders, who, he said, had brought destruc
tion upon the party, decleared that he
culd not be driven from his old allegiance
into a party with which he did not care to
affiliate-..
Senator Jones, chairman of the Demo
cratic national committee, denied that he
had any "ulterior motives" In not inviting
Mr. McLaurin to enter the caucus. Mr.
Tillman reviewed the whole controversy.
Mr. Hoar took occasion to express the opin
ion that it was very doubtful whether both
the South Carolina seats in the Senate were
not In reality vacant. He contended that
when the resignations were offered last
pprlng to the Governor they could not be
withdrawn thrt after, having become im
mediately operative. The climax came
whn Senator Tillman challenged Mr. Mc
Laurin to join with him in preparing their
joint resignations and handing them to the
presiding officer of the Senate. This chal
lenge Mr. McLaurin did not accept, and the
episode was brought to r.n abrupt close by
Senator Lodge moving an executive ses
sion. M'LAURIN'S SPEECH.
"When Mr. McLaurin arose to speak he
fcad before him a huge pile of manuscript.
"I arise to a question of per.- r. il privilege
In connection with the publication of the
statement that I have been excluded from
participation in the Democratic party," he
announced. "With evidence of considerable
emotion, he proceeded to explain that if
Mich was the case and if he were to be
without assignment upon committees the
riirht of his State which he in part repre
sented In the Senate would suffer. The
only notice he had ever had. he said, that
he w:is to be excluded from the Democratic
caucus came last spring before the ad
journment of the Senate, when the chair
man of the Democratic national committee
In the cloakroom asked him why he no
longer attended the Democratic caucuses.
He had replied that in view of his opinion
cf th- questions growing out of the Span
ish war he thought his presence might be
mharrassing. The Democratic chairman
had replied: "Then, perhaps. It would be
b ss rnbarrasstr.g to you not to be invited
to the caw-uses?" Mr. McLaurin said he
h-ol replied: "Certainly."
This incident. Mr. McLaurin declared,
w.cs the culmination of a long series of
vents in a contest waged by an element
of the Democratic party against him. The
entire Senate by this time had become in
terested. Several Republicans crossed the
political aisle to the Democratic side, the
better to listen to what Mr. McLaurin had
to say.
Cor.tlnulne. M-. Mclaurin said he could
be silent did he not fear that the move
ment atrainst him was one to keep alive
sectionalism. For many years the people
of the South had realized that they had
not obtained their fair share of the na
tional Iwnetits. Mr. Mcliurin recalled the
fact th.it although Samuel J. Kandall had
ndvoeated a protective tariff, he had been
voted for in a Democratic national conven
tion for President. Hancock, although he
eh . 1 a red that tie tariff was a local issue.
h t 1 been nominated for President, and
Daid P. Hill, although he opposed the in
C' tn.' tax. had net been read out of the
I n.-.. ratio party. The holding of surh
vb ws by Northern mm, no matter how ill
verse, did not endanger the position of cer
tain political leaders, and consequently
tlit ' were immune from attack. Put when
a South, rn man. said Mr. Mcliurin, triad
to gYt fe ben'f t of the tariff for his io
p!e. those whoe political career might be
nd-'d by the success of his efforts were
ready to crush and humiliite him. He had
eonti-n-'.nl that if the tariff were a robbery.
h:s s-ction should share In the booty.
Ppon the isu of that speech he had later
g I..- int a campaign in South Carolina,
a' i. although his Democracy had been at
tacked u: e- the stump, the people of his
SMte had ir.dory, d him. He declared that
durir.ar that campaign calumny, falsehood
and tri. kry r..r before equaled in Amer
ican potties had been employed.
THE LATEST CHARGE.
X-w the principal harge ablast him was
that io.ri:; to- McKinley administration
h - had l-tn "bought by patronage," and
that ae had renewed his former contract
with President Ii osevelt. Entertaining the
hih p-rs..nal regard that h did for both
the i,4te President and his successor, Mr.
McLaurin said it would be unnecessary for
birn to say that neither would stoop to
Fa Unable an act. It was true an unfortu
nate condition of affairs had existed in his
State, and that he had recommended gold
r.:f ii for oUief bec.use he did not desire to
f-e- h repetition oi the horrible affair at
Lik.i!le, when a r.'gn postmaster had
be n burned to death. II" had voted for
tri war with Spain, and declared that in
tli same spirit in which he had cast that
vote he felt th-it he was rompeiud to sup
port the administration that conducted it.
He htlll thought that the conduct of the
war should have Uen nonpartisan, and
during its progress he had never heard
from lres:dent McKinley' lips a word con-
; eernlng party advantage. Mr. McLaurin
P'Jld a high tribute to the late President,
whom he characterized as a "broad states
i m;,n "n' Christian gentleman."
; .hlle without ofhcial knowledge of the
. charges brought against him by his Demo
i cratic colleagues, from the newspapers he
, understood that the principal charges were
I that he had not opposed the ratification of
I me treaty or peace with Spain, that he had
"i'neiq lru? administration in its efforts to
T(SJJe ordfr !n the Philippines and to that
end had voted for an increase in the stand
ing army, and that he was in favor of the
upbuilding of the American merchant
marine. "If thes- are the only charges,"
said he dramatically, "thev are true and I
glory in them." He said he h4d not wUhed
to vote against his partv upon the question
of ratifying the peace "treaty, and had it
not been for the reopening of hostilities in
the Philippines he would have deferred to
the opinion of his colleagues. Put, he de
clared, the dictates of rtason and con
science should not be stiried by the party
lash.
With bitter words Mr. McLaurin then
proceeded to excoriate the new Kaders of
the Democracy, who. he said, had guided
the party through its destruction during
the last six years and were trying to cruci
fy those who would seek to draw the Demo
cratic party back to its old allegiance. He
still propose d, he said, to vote in his judg
ment for what he believed to be along the
llntH of Democratic principles, but he did
not propose to place himself against a
proposition which he believed to be for the
best Interests of the people simply because
It was advocated by Republicans.
In conclusion Mr. McLaurin said he did
not propose to be driven from his own
party nor to be forced into affiliation with
the party with which he did not care to
ally himself and that on great public ques
tions he would act according to the dictates
of his own conscience and best judgment.
MR. JONES'S REPLY.
When Mr. McLaurin took his seat Mr.
Jones, of Arkansas, took the floor. Some
of the statements made by Mr. McLaurin
Mr. Jones considered a rellection upon him
self and said he desired to offer a statement
concerning the incident to which Mr. Mc
Laurin had referred. At the extra session
of the Senate last spring he had been asked
by the caucus officer for the list of senators
who were to be summoned to a caucus, and
Mc Lau rin's name being mentioned, he
(Jones) had said he himself would see the
senator from South Carolina. "I met him In
the cloakroom," sai l Mr. Jones, "and, re
calling the fact that he had not attended
a Democratic caucus for more than two
years. I asked him what his status was.
He replied that his relations with the party

HAS CHANGED 'ITS PLANS
ACTION OF THE M'KINLEY MEMO
RIAL AUCH ASSOCIATION.
It I In Decided Not to Appeal to the
Public for Subscriptions, but Will
Auk Congress for 3Ioney.
WASHINGTON. Dec. O.-The William Mc
Kinley National Memorial Arch Associa
tion has determined to change its plan
of operation so as to appeal to Congress
instead of to the public for the erection of
the proposed McKinley memorial at Wash
ington. Secretary Gage offered the follow
ing resolutions, which were seconded by
Mr. Thomas F. Walsh and adopted:
"Whereas, Through a resolution present
ed to this committee by the trustees of
the McKinley National Memorial Asso
ciation, it is reported that a canvass of
the country for subscriptions to the pro
posed memorial arch in Washington will
bo prejudicial if not destructive- to tho
erection of a proper monument or memorial
over the .remains of the late President at
Canton, therefore,
"Resolved. That this committee give up
its appeal to the country for popular con
tributions for the memorial arch in Wash
ington and turn Its attention and efforts
to secure from Congress an appropriation
from the public treasury sufficient in
amount to erect in Washington a memorial
which in a fitting manner shall represent
the Nation's appreciation of the noble char
acter and distinguished public services of
William McKinley.
"Resolved. That this committee accept
the tender of earnest co-operation from the
trustees of the McKinley National Memo
rial Association to erect by the means of
congressional appropriation the proposed
memorial arch in Washington."
The association will be reincorporated
and contributions received by the associa
tion for the proposed memorial arch will
be returned.

ANOTHER GREAT BENEFACTION
PROPOSED nY MR. CARNEGIE.
Offers to Establish a University for
Higher Education nt the Na
tional Capital.
WRITES TO THE PRESIDENT
NV1IO WILL. SEND A MESSAGE TO
CONGRESS OX THE SUBJECT.
Mr. Carnegie NVII1 Donate $10,000,000,
to He Held in Trnst Like the
Smlthson Fund.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. The Post to
morrow will say: "President Roosevelt
has received a letter from Andrew Car
negie in which the latter offers to make a
donation of $10,ouO,000 to the United States.
The letter will be referred to Congress by
the President in a special message.
"Mr. Carnegie's gift is for the purpose
of establishing in Washington a university
for higher education. As far as his idea
has been developed it proposes a gift after
the manner of the bequest of James Smith
son, the Englishman, who gave Jl.ono.OiO
for establishment and maintenance of what
is known as the Smithsonian Institution.
Smithson desired the institution founded
by him to be a factor in 'the diffusion of
scientific knowledge.' Mr. Carnegie pro
poses that the university which he is to
endow shall be the greatest Institution In
the world for the development of higher
education. He has consulted President
Gilman of Johns Hopkins University; Pres
ident Hadley. of Yale; President Eliot, of
Harvard; former President White, of Cor
nell, and all the leading educators of the
country. They heartily Indorse his plans.
The proposed university will not Interfere
In the least with the educational Institu
tions already established, but will supple
ment them, lor, according to the rresent
plan, Its doors will be open only to those
who desire to take up a post-graduate
course. Mr. Carnegie also wants the new
university to take the lead in original re
search, so that the United States can
eventually stand side by side with Ger
many, if not excel that nation in scientific
development.
"Mr. Carnegie's plan does not propose
a national university in the sense that an
appropriation will be asked or needed.
The government is simply to be the trustee
of the magnificent endowment just as it
administers the fund bequeathed by Smith
son. It is probable a board of regents will
be appointed, as in the case of the Smith
sonian Institution, or It may be that the
government will be represented upon the
board of directors, which it is contemplated
shall consist of men of national reputa
tion. "Mr. Carnegie has kept the proposed en
dowment a secret until he could definitely
arramte the plans and scope of the new
univt- ty. Kven yet all those details have
not U on arranged, so little more than the
outline of the gift cm be published.
"It is known, however, that he does not
propose to ask from Congress a single
foot of land on which the university build
ings will be constructed. The entire ex
pense is to be borne out of his endowment.
No site has yet been selected. It will.
however, necessarily be very large, as It
Is proposed to construct a series of mag
nicent structures. The amount of money
to be given by Mr. Carnegie equals the
sum of the present endowment fund of
Harvard, and is considerably more than
the Invested fund of Yale. With the Cath
olic University. Washington will be the
educational center of the country."

SAN FRANCISCO. Dec. ?.-Mrs. Jane L

D
university campus of about 9,e.oo acres. The
other deed of grant covers the Stanford
residence on California street, which event
ually Is to be used for educational pur
poses. The deed of gift covers bonds and
stocks heretofore given and certain securi
ties not included in former gifts. The
grants are largely confirmatory in charac
ter and are made under the provisions of
the Stanford University constitutional
amendment, which legalized grants and
gifts made to the university. This amend
ment was adopted in order to set at rest
any question as to the validity of the orig
inal endowment and to prevent legal tech
nicalities from Interfering with the future
donations to this great educational institu
tion, which was founded by Mr. and Mrs.
Stanford as a memorial to their only son.
Mrs. Stanford has now given the equiva
lent of over $25,000.000 to the Leland Stan

DEATH WAS ACCIDENTAL
VERDICT OF CORONER'S JIRY IN
THE CASE Ol" EMMELINE DALE.
Evidence Introduced to Show the
Child Ate Strychnine Tablet,
Thinking They Were Candy.
NEW YORK, Dec. 9. The coroner's in
quiry Into the death of Emmeline Dale, the
child of Elizabeth Howe Dale, was held in
Hoboken to-night and resulted in a verdict
of accidental death from poisoning. Ten
witnesses In all were heard at the inquest.
The most Important ones were Dr. Kud
lich, the attending physician. County Phy
sician Converse and F. S. Billings, of Bos
ton. Much of the testimony was relative
to points already made public. Dr. Kud
llch told of the child's symptoms, and said
they were undoubtedly those following
strychnine poisoning. Dr. Converse read
the report on the analysis of the contents
of the child's stomach. This analysis had
been made by Dr. Otto IL Schultz, and told
of the finding of traces of strychnine.
The witness who cleared Mrs. Dale was
Mr. Billings, a commercial traveler. He
occupied a room adjoining Mrs. Dale's at
the hotel the night the child died, and he
related how he had heard the moans and
screams of a child In the next room.
Shortly afterward he heard a woman's
voice inquiring sleepily:
"Emmeline, what's the matter; have you
had a bad dream?"
The child grew quiet. Soon afterward
It began to scream again, and the woman
then seemed to get excited, and Billings
heard her ask the child:
"Did vou eat any of those tablets?"
The child finally said: "I ate some of
that candy."
The Jury at once found that Emmeline
died after having accidentally eaten
strychnine tablets. Mrs. Dale was not
present at the inquest, not being able to
leave the hospital.
Mrs. Dale's attorneys said they would at
once ask for the release of Mrs. Dale on
bail, rending the action of the grand jury
in the matter.

LOS ANGELES, Cab, Dec. 9. H. J.
Fleischman, cashier of the Farmers' and
Merchants' Bank, of this city, has disap
peared with a sum of the bank's money
which Vice President H. W. Hellman es
timates at $100,000. The shortage was dis
covered to-day. Fleischman has not been
seen since 9 o'clock Saturday morning. At
that hour he was at his club. He notified
the bank people that he was ill, Saturday
morning, and could not be at his desk.
Nothing was thought of the matter at the
time. When Fleischman failed to report to
day his accounts were gone over and the
shortage discovered. The exact amount
has not yet been ascertained.
PTeischman had been cashier and assist
ant cashier of the Farmers' and Merchants'
Bank for many years. He began work for
the bank when a boy in 1S75. He was under
bond with a surety company for $30,000. In
addition to this he had real estate and
personal property in this city sufficient, in
the opinion of Mr. Hellman, to protect the
bank from loss of a dollar. Fleischman
married the daughter of A. J. Harrell, a
wealthy cattle man of Vlsalia, but was
divorced some time ago. He Is forty-two
years of age, of medium build and smooth
face.
The Farmers' and Merchants Bank, of
which I. W. Hellman is president and H.
W. Hellman is vice president, is the oldest
and strongest bank in southern California.
Its capital is $300,000, with a surplus of
$1hk).Mij and deposits of $.".5u0.000.
H. W. Hellman said: "Fleischman had no
valid excuse for taking the money. He has
property enough to realize the amount he
has taken from the bank. He was always
considered a man of fine habits and un
impeachable integrity. We are at com
plete loss to account for his action. The
hank is .amply protected, and will not lose
a cent. We have not the slightest idea of
Fleischman's whereabouts. It is probable
he left Saturday after telephoning the bank
that he would not be down. Of course,
with such a start, it may be some time be
fore he is located. However, we are not
worrying about the money, since we have
bond and collateral sufficient to protect us
fully."

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 9.-I. W. Hill
man, president of the Nevada Bank of this
city and holding a similar office In connec
tion with the Farmers' and Merchants
Bank at Los Angeles, made the following
statement regarding the defalcation of H.
J. Fleischman, cashier of the Los Angeles
bank:
"The fact that we have been robbed of
$100 xj cuts no figure. The bank will go on
as usual, and will not be in the least handi
capped by the loss of such a sum. which,
while large, does not affect the capital of
the concern at all. I am greatly grieved
and disappointed in the man. He has been
in our employ for more than twenty years,
and. of course, was looked upon as one of
the best men In our service or he would not
have'had the position so long. I have made
up my mind to prosecute him to the end
should he be captured. We have wired ev
ery section of this country and Mexico, and
I have every hope that he will be captured
eventually. There will be no compromise.
The bank Is looked on as one of the model
banks of this country. 1 went over the
books two weeks ago and everything was
1 straight, so we are certain the money was
taken within the last few days. I cannot
but believe that there is a woman In the
case somewhere. I feel certsln that the de
falcation was not made to cover up private
speculative losses."

missionary, and her companion: "Consid
erable confirmation of the report that Miss
Ellen M. Stone and Mrs. Tsilka are dead
comes from Salonica, but nothing positive
is yet known. Our (American Board of For
eign Mission's) messengers have not re
turned. Their delay is intelligible, for trav
eling over mountains covered with snow
is difficult, while the brigands are now
more than ever hard to get into communi
cation with. We still hope that the report
that the captives are dead may be only a
ruse of the brigands to prevent being pur
sued." LOOTED BY BURGLARS.

WASHINGTON. Dcc.j 9.-The President
to-day sent to the Semite a large numlnr
of recess and new appointments, among
them the names of A. W. Wishard, of In
dianapolis, to be solicit r of internal reve
nue, Joseph B. Kcaling jo be district attor
ney for Indiana and Rej. James L. Griffes,
of Rensselaer, to be ch.jplain in the army.
The latter appointment was secured by
Representative Crump.i:kcr. Sixteen ap
pointments of Indianas to postmaster
ships also were sent tt the Senate. The
Senate announced a bath of confirmations,
among them that of Ri bert E. Mansheld,
of Indiana, to bo cont-ul at Valparaiso,
Chile. Among the posfmasters appointed
to-day are the following in Indiana:
William C. West. Farmland.
L. V. Huskirk, Bloomif.gton.
William Stevens. Colufnbus.
John W. E. Ward, Co 'verse.
Fletcher W. Boyd. Colington.

James F. Lawson, Spiu r.
Freu J. Herrman. Tel if City.
Thomas H. Adams, V jicennes.
There was some surprise when the namt
of Fred Kimbley, of drl cans, Ind., editor
of the Progress-Examiner, of that city,
appeared among the list of postmasters.
Senator Bevcridge reo'.rnmended him for
appointment shortly bc-fore his departure
for his trip around theworld. Lattr, pro
tests were made on th j ground that Kim
bley had published editorials in his p.ipr
strongly censuring President McKinley for
his delay in having tU- United States go
to the rescue of Cuba; and to war with
Spain. Senator Beverige being away the
recomnu ndation was h -ld up until his re
turn, and nothing morj was heard of the
matter until the appointment was mado
to-day. In Kimbley's lltorials he allui-d
to the Pmident as a toward and a man
w ithout any backbone.! but since the war
he has stated that hv realizes that h
made a mistake and wjis somewhat hasty
in attacking the Preside H. This statement,
however, does not pre nt the friends and
admirers of Mr. McKi ley from opposing
the appointment of Ki. bby, and it is un
derstood that Senator Jlanna will attempt
to prevent the confirmation of the appoint
ment if it is taken up the Senate in ex
ecutive session.
