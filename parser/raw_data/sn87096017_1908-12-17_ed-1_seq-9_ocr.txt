From the earliest days of the ring the
knock-out blow was aimed for the jaw,

punches were thrown in to worry and
weary the fighter, but It a scientific man
had told one of the old fighters that the
most vulnerable spot was the region of
the stomach, he'd have laughed at him

Why Farmers Should Buy a
Stallion from Me
First.—Because I live right here and
can save you time and money.
Second.—Because I buy direct from
the breeder and buy what I think will
make the farmer some money.
Third.—Because I don't stall feed
them for a year or two before I sell
them, therefore I don't sell you a
worthless lot of beef.
Fourth.—Because if you go East and
buy you will get a stall fed, good for
nothing horse, something to look at,
that's all.
Fifth.—Because a farmer who buys a
stallion doesn't buy one to look at, he
buys one for a money maker. That's
the kind I sell.
Sixth.—Because if you go East and
buy you will get a stall fed horse with
a guarantee that is absolutely worth
less in this state.
Seventh.—Because if you buy from
me I will give you a guarantee that is
as good as a government bond. All I
ask is for you to come and look over
my horses and use your own judgment
as to these being good reasons.

President Sends Hot Message
to Congress.
PURCHASE OF PAKAMA CANAL
Executive Brands the Newspaper
Charges as False.
Washington, Dec. 15.—President
Roosevelt today transmitted to con
gress a special message regarding the
charges published by certain newspa
pers that several Americans profited
by the purchase of the property of the
Panama Canal company of France.
The message, in part, follows:
In view of the constant reiteration
of the assertion that there was some
corrupt action by or on behalf of the
United States government in connec
tion with the acquisition of the title
of the French company to the Pan
ama canal, and of the repetition of the
story that a syndicate of American
citizens owned either one or both of
the Panama companies, I deem it wise
to submit to the congress all the in
formation I have on the subject. These
stories were first brotight to my at
tention as published in a paper in In
dianapolis, called the News, edited by
Mr. Delavan Smith. The stories were
scurrilous and libelous in character
and false in every essential particu
lar. Mr. Smith shelters himself be
hind the excuse that he merely ac
cepted the statements which had ap
peared in a paper published in New
York, the World, owned by Mr. Jos
eph Pulitzer.
It is Idle to *ay that the known
character of Mr. Pulitzer and his
newspaper are such that the state
ments in that paper will be believed
by nobody unfortunately, thousands
of persons are ill informed in this
respect and believe the statements
they see in print, even though they
appear in a newspaper published by
Mr. Pulitzer. A member of the con
gress has actually introduced a reso
lution in reference to these charges
and I therefore lay all the facts be
fore you.
Sums Up Newspaper Charges.
The story repeated at various
times by the World and by its fol
lowers in the newspaper press is sub
stantially as follows: That there
was corruption by or on behalf of the
government of the United States in
the transaction by which the Panama
canal property was acquired from its
Frerich owners that there were im
proper dealings of some kind be
tween agents of the government and
outside persons, representing or act
ing tor an American syndicate which
bad gotten possession of the French
company that among these persons,
who, it was alleged, made "huge
profits," were Mr. Charles P. Taft, a
brother of Mr. William H. Taft, then
candidate for the presidency, and Mr.
Douglas Robinson, my brother-in-law
that Mr. Cromwell, the counsel for
the Panama Canal company in the
negotiations, was in some way impli
cated with the United States govern
ment authorities in these important
transactions that the government
has concealed the true facts and has
destroyed, or procured or agreed to
the destruction of, certain documents
that Mr. W. H. Taft was secretary of
war at the time that by an agree
ment between the United States gov
ernment and the beneficiaries of the
deal all traces thereof were "wiped
out" by transferring all the archives
and secrets to the American govern
ment just before the holding of the
convention last June and at which
Mr. Taft was nominated.. The state
ments are false in every partic
ular from beginning to end. The
wickedness of -the slanders is 'only
surpassed by their fatuity.
String of Infamous Libels.
Now, these stories, as a matter of
fact, need no investigation whatever.
No shadow of proof has been, or can
be, produced on behalf of any of them.
They consist simply of a string of in
famous libels. In form they are in
part libels upon individuals, upon Mr.
Taft and Mr. Robinson for instance.
But they are in fact wholly and in
form partly a- libel upon the United
States government. I do not believe
we should concern ourselves with the
particular individuals who wrote the
lying and libelous editorials, articles
from correspondents, or articles in
the news columns. The real offender
is Mr. Jobeph Pulitzer, editor and
proprietor the World. While the
criminal offense of which Mr. Pulitzer
has been guilty is in form a libel upon
individuals the great injury done is in
blackening the good name of the
American
people it should not be left
to the private citizen to sue Mr. Pulit
zer for libel. He should be prose
cuted for libel by the government au
thorities. In point of encouragement
of iniquity, in point of infamy, of
wrong doing, there is nothing to
choose between a public servant who
betrays his trust, a public servant
who is guilty of blackmail, or theft,
or financial dishonesty of any kind,
and a man guilty as Mr. Joseph Pu
litzer has been guilty in this instance.
It is therefore a high nationality to
bring to justice this villifler of the
Whole American people and the at
torney general has under considera
tion the form in which- the proceed
ings against Mr. Pulitzer shall be
brought
The president then details at length
transactions in connection with the
purchase of the canal property.

RESENTS LANGUAGE USED
House Committee to Consider Portion
of Annual Message.
Washington, D*c. 11.—Immediately
after the convening of the house Rep
resentative Perkins of New York in
troduced a resolution which had here
tofore been agreed upon providing for
the appointment of a special commit
tee of five members to consider the
proper means of dealing with that
portion of the president's message
which criticises the course of con
gress in prohibiting the detail of
secret service men to duty outside of
their own bureau. The resolution is
preceded by a preamble reciting some
expressions of the message. No effort
is made to give voice to the feeling of
the house. In presenting the resolu
tion Mr. Perkins made a brief state
ment, saying that he was satisfied
that the house would not hesitate to
take such action as the dignity of that
body required. He said that some of
the president's expressions were un
fortunate.
The resolution was adopted and
Messrs. Perkins (N. Y.), Denby
(Mich.), Weeks (Mass.), Williams
(Miss.) and Lloyd (Mo.) were ap
pointed on the committee.
DAVIS DECLARED NOT GUILTY
Verdict in Dr. Rustin Murder Case at
Omaha.
Omaha, Dec. 10.—After thirteen
hours' deliberation the jury in the
case of Charles E. Davis, charged
with the murder on the morning of
Sept. 2 of Dr. Frederick T. Rustin,
agreed upon a verdict of not guilty.
Judge Sears received the verdict and
ordered the discharge of the prisoner.
This case has attracted unusual at
tention not only on account of the
prominence of the victim of the kill
ing, who was one of the leading physi
cians and surgeons of the city, and
the mystery surrounding the tragedy,
but because of the family connections
of the defendant. Although himself
holding but a minor position in the
First National bank Davis is the
brother of the vice president and
uncle of th'e president, cashier and
other officials of that institution and

Capture Venezuelan Vessel Off
Puerto Cabelio.
Willemstad, Island of Curacao, Dec.
14.—The Dutch cruiser Gelderland
came into this port towing the Vene
zuelan coast guardship Alix with the
Dutch flag flying and a Dutch crew
on board. The Gelderland captured
the Alix off Puerto Cabelio on Satur
day. At that time the Alix was lying
close in shore and, notwithstanding
the threat which the Venezuelan gov
ernment had made to fire upon any
of the Dutch warships committing a
hostile -act, the Gelderland steamed
at full speed toward the guardship
and sent an officer and guard in a
launch to seize her. This they did
without resistance and no shots came
from the forts on land.
The crew of the Alix was put ashore
and the Dutch officer and marines re
mained on board.
The seizure of the Alix was in ac
cordance with the plans of the Hol
land government when Instructions
were issued to the three Dutch war
ships now in these waters to make a
demonstration off the coast of Vene
zuela and to capture any Venezuelan
ships of war or guard vessels that
they might find.
EXCITEMENT IN CARACAS
Caused by Capture of Venezuelan
Guardship.
Caracas, Dec. 15.—When news of
the capture of the Venezuelan coast
guardship Alexis by the Dutch cruis
er Gelderland became known at Cara
cas a big crowd at once assembled in
the Plaza Bollver and demonstrated
in support of the government.
Then a crowd of citizens, including
a large number of students, went to
the office of El Constitutcional, the
organ of President Castro, and in
dulged in a counter demonstration.
The feelings of this crowd were
plainly hostile to Castro and to the
policy adopted by Acting President
Gomez, who has issued a decree
placing the republic in a state of de
fense.
IMPORTS WILL BE LIMITED
Free Trade With the Philippines
Agreed Upon.
Washington, Dec. 11.—Free tradt
with the Philippines was one of th
most important matters agreed upor
by President-Elect Taft and the Re
publican members' of the ways and
means committee at a conference on
tariff revision. While Mr. Taft favort
free trade with the insular posses
sions without any restrictions it it
understood that in order that ther:
shall be no dissention he has agreed
that the amount of sugar and toban
co which should be allowed entry free
of duty should be restricted.
With that end in view it Is expect
ed that thf sugar interests have
agreed to a compromise by which 300.
000 tons o. Bugar will be admitted
from the rhlllppines annually free -f
duty and that all sugar over that
amount will pay the present rate "f
duty, which is 25 per cent less than
the duty imposed by the Dingley tar
iff on sugar from other countries.
Added a Little Sulphur.

Murray Cure for Liquor and Opium Habits
There are no bad after effects as a result of the Murray Cure. There
is nothing in the treatment which can injure the patient and there is every
aid to improvement in general health. In this respect the Murray Cure
is entirely unlike the so-called "gold
cures." We particularly recommend
investigating the record of the Mur
ray Cure and comparing it with the
results of other treatment touching
the health and manhood of patients.
