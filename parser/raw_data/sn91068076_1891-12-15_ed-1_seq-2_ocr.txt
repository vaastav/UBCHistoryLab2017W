TUESDAY. DECEMHUR 15, 1891
President Harrison snid in his mes
sage that the Itatncuse bud been decide?!
against the government and that it
would be appealed. Hut the fact seems to
be that only the case against the Robert
and Minnie has been tried and that it
cannot be appealed as the defendants
were acquitted. The presidents message i
was too long for all of it to be correct
No MORE distressing personal calamity

has happened in tins community for

years than the accidental death ot Mr.
Hamilton yesterday. A man of more
than ordinarv attractive uresence. his
friends must be numbered by the n urn-
ber of his acquaintances, and his ac-
quaintanceship was wide. Even lie who 1
met him only casually felt the charm ol ;

a delightful manner, as spontaneous as
it was apparently sincere. That the life i
of such a man should go out as his has
is especially hard to bear, especially hard
to be reconciled to. I

It apK'ars that Asheville is already as
well favored in the matter of low passen
ger rates as we have a right to expect.
There is one point at which, howevtr, a
considerable improvement might he
made namely from the depot of this
town up to the square. When it can 1
happen that one of the principal trains .
that brings passengers in'o Asheville j8

With a great many harsh words, some-1 From the New Y rk Herald,
one writes the Wilmington Messenger I The election of Speaker Crisp on Mon
thnt K. W. Iloudillon plagiarized the fol-! day unites the democratic party in con
lowing from a volume written in 1SH', :

Yet the liKtit of a whole .oul iie.
When love is done.
The Wilmington Messenger correctly
points out that Iloudillon printed his
poem some time in the 70's, and there -
fore could not have stolen it from n vol-
urae published in 1S87. Our reeollei-
tion is that this poem appeared, not ex-
actly as printed above, where the "has"
in the second line is an interpolation, in
the Spectator magazine. From there it
was copied into Littell's Living Age, an
ecletic magazine printed in Boston. It
is safe to say these verses, which have
great merit, were printed hundreds o(
. ' r . ,
times in the newspapers before 1SS7.

and peTlectly obvious suggestions-ull,
in fact, that the dynamiter had left be-
hind him. These were a button, a frag-
meat of underclothing and a piece of ,
cloth torn from the shoulder of bis eoat. j
On the button was the name of a Boston I
tailor. What more natural than to take
this to Boston und see if it, with the !
piece of coat, could be identified by the 1
firm who made uplhe .uit? This simple

had made a suit from the piece of which
the shoulder piece was part and his order
book showed for whom It was made,
Henry L. Norcross, a note broker, of"No.
12 Pearl itiect. A glance at the office
at that number showed that it bad beeti
closed for some time, but further inquiry
revealed the fact that Norcross had lived
at Summerville, not tar from Boston.
There it came out that Norcross bad
been missing from borne for ten days or
more, and later the underclothing was
fully identified by hi mother who was
able to find some of her own mending on
it. Then close friend of Norcross went
to New York and saw at once that the
head of the dynamiter was all that re
mained of their acquaintance. And the
"finest police force in the world" stood
around heavily and wondered bow a re
porter of 27 could possibly know more
than they did.
It appears that Norcross was a man of
good lamily who bad been recently disap
pointed because he had been unable to
raise money for the trial of an elevated
railway he bad patented. From that,
In a morose state and with, no one will
ever know, what scheme in bis mind, he
began to dabble in chemicals. That his
experiments were probably dangerous
and that he knew they were is shown
by the fact that he would not allow a
boy companion of those days to handle
the chemical and once took from him
with every lignot alarm a bottle contain
ing ome mixture the boy did not know
the nature of and wa not told by Nor
cros. Norcros, reputation was that of a
scholar, a deep reader, inclined to be ex
clusive aud in no sense a crank. His
closest friend in business cannot account
for Norcross' part in the tragedy, and
though come apeak ofhimaseccentricand
cnliar" they cannot furnish a certain clue
to the cause ot the insanity he must have
been afflicted with when be dropped on
the floor of Sage' office the dynamite

These big crops have prncticully ruined
the Farmers' alliance as a party, and
the United States' senutors here are
breathing easier and talking with more
independence than they huve shown lor
a year. Those who are re-elected pay no
attention to the alliance, and their leel
ing is well expressed in a remark made
by SeuatorPugh in the senate cloak room
jnst before the lust session closed. Vest
and Pugh were sitting togeilier in the
room, and I'ugh was looking over his

The important news comes from Wash
ington that speaker Crisp has decided to
appoint Mi. Springer instead ol Mr.
Springer instead of Mr. Mills as chair-
man of the committee on wavs and
means. The determination, it is said,
has lieen influenced in some degree by
the course ol Mr. Mills since thecau.u.
but more by a radical difference of opm-
i()n to tlle ()()icv f tlll, )arlv
with regard to the method of tariff re
gress and throughout the country. It is
i n victory for conservative dcnincracv, a
victory for common sense. It is not a
personal triumph for Crisp, Hill or Tarn- j
; many, nor for Smith, Hrown orKohiu-i
son, but a triumph .or the whole party.
