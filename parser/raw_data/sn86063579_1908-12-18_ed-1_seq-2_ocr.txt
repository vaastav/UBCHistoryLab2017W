Bryan feda that he is called up
on to save his country rather than
SüUlá.
Congress is in full sway and
ftatehood for New Mexico looks
exceedingly bright.
The El Taso Times is rapidly
growing into one of the best and
most relk'.Me daily papers in bijr
old Texas. Splendid improve
ments have recently been made
in the paper.
The Fanama canal continues
to be a warm number. It is not
at all surprising that several
tons of dynamite have just pone
off down there simultaneously
-and then some.
Quite a few papers in the ter
ritory are losing sleep over a
new name for New Mexico when
she becomes a state. The Graphic
will be delighted with any old
name if we get Ftatehood. New
Mexico is good enough for us.
We are reminded that a rose
would be just as sweet with any
other name.
Says President Roosevelt in
his message just out: "I advo
cate the immediate admission of
New Mexico and Arizona as
states. This should be done at
the present session of the Con
gress. The people of the two
territories have made it evident
and I trust that this will be done
without delay."
If such an unlocked for thing
that Delegate Andrews don't get
us statehood should happen, we
hive at least the happy consola
tion of knowing that he is the
only man on earth who could
have come within a mile of gel
ting it. However, we look fur
the man who "does things" to
push her through at the present
short session.
The one feature of the Christ
mastide that cannot be overdone
is the giving of comfort to the
needy. Sometimes it appears
that the custom of exchanging
gifts has its questionable side,
in the increasing demands upon
Blender purses and the cultiva
tion of a spirit of mendicancy in
servitors. These matters, how
ever, regulate themselves, and
probably little harm is done by
the swelling of the spirit of gen
erosity at this holy time. But
the relief of the poor and un
fortunate is blessed work that
can never work injury to him
who gives.
A Mr. F. M. Tarter, of Rich
Hill, Mo., wants a place under
the incoming administration.
Although he has his first and
sacond choice as to the plums he
would like to have bestowed, he
does not confine himself to eith
er of those or nothing. He ha3
written a letter to a friend,
prominent in politics, soliciting
aid in landing what he most de
sires. In that letter he expres
ses a decided preference for the
fish and game wardenship. He
says in his communication, how
ever, that "if that place is
promised, state mine inspector
will do. If that place is also
promised, then any old slice will
do-anything, in fact, to keep
me from digging coal in my old
days." The letter has been re
ferred to Attorney General Had-
leyby the gentleman who re
ceived it.
Trouble for Postal BUL
It looks now as if a thorny
path confronts the postal sav
ings bank bill. When Senator
Carter secured a special order to
take up this measure it is said
he had pledges of sufficient votes
to'pass the bill h the senate. The
situation seems to have changed
and at present it is doubtful
whether Senator Carter can rally
anywhere near the required
number. In fact, it is stated
that he will fall short a dozen
votes on the Republican side.
This change of front has been
brought about by investigations
conducted abroad by members of
the National Monetary Com
mission, who reported adversely
to he establishment of postal
savings banks.
Several members are now on
record in favor of the govern
ment keeping out of the bank
business rather than engaging in
this new policy.
Chairman AUrich u ready to
take a positive stand against the
passage of the bill and will have
the support of a large number
of senators because of the op
position of small bankers
throughout the country. The
position is taken that these small
banks in many instances would
be driven out of business by the
postal banks, and in view of the
strong opposition arising the
prospect is that no vote will be
obtained on the postal savings
bank bill at any day in the im
mediate future.
Cattle barons, whose ranches in
the west are gradually bein? cut
up for agricultural purposes, are
investigating Mexican lands with
regard to advantages they oiTe
for the raising of cattle. Consul
Griffith, of Tampico, reports thai
the cattle rangers have been vir
tually forced to look elsewhere
for a cattle country, and they
have discovered that cattle can
be raised at less expense in
Mexico and also that there is an
advantage to cattlemen in in
land and water transportation
facilities for shipment to the
United States. The climate,
grass and water and general to
pography is taid to be we
adapted to animal growth and
comfort.
Work as a Medicine.
One of the most noticeable
things among the unemployed is
the rapidity with which they
age. The more delicately adjust
ed a piece of machinery is, the
quicker it rusts out and goe3 to
ruin when not running.
Whea the mind is not health
fully employed and constantly
exercised it ruins itself very
quickly. There are many in
stances in history where great
men, when deprived of liberty,
when their employment was
taken away from them, very
quickly went to pieces. They
were unable to sustain the
shock.
Statistics show that great men
tal workers are, as a rule, long
lived. Activity is conducive to
longevity.
There is nothing like having
plenty of work, something to
look forward to constantly,
something to plan for, think for,
live for. There is nothing more
fatal to growth and normal liv
ing than the monotony which
comes irom mental inaction,
nothing more fatal to growth
han stagnation.
There are a great many semi-
invalids in this country today
who could probably be cured by
the right kind of work, mental
or physical, because they are in
valids mentally because they are
physically. Ex.
