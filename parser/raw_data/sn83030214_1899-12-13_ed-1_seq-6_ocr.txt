the s?-l?-'-ti? n ' f workmen for pol?tica] reasons
than to remain In the grasp of private 00?*pora*
tlons who can levy exorbitant ??harireB.
This is a view of the stiiijeet "vhlrh it bt

Is a ?lain.'1-r that in buying State an?l inunlcijial
law they may bring about Um llSStl til lion Of
their own business. t'lidoubtcdly the people
we get io govern us have a natara] tendency to
make as much out of the city payrolls as yousl
J lile, and are not overscrupulous about the means
employed. Politicians Stole long before the
present system of corporation assessments for
jMilltical purposes ?.vus perfected, ami ?louhtless
they would do It after that system was sninshed.
Hut there is n?? denylni. that to-day that sys?
tem is tile prop of corrupt government,
if ?great business Interests desl?e to continue
in control of their own trnnHport-ntlon Hue? ami
other similar enterprises it is time for them to
stop their corrupting streams. BooMo them
poli-o blackmail is petty thieving, and the aver?
age citizen is beginning to bo aware of it. Al?
most evcryboily understands why Senator Platt
di?! not want to testify and why the Mazet
Committee suddenly broke up. It did Mt
dare to get to the core of political corrupt!.
?which is this granting by State and city author?
ities of privileges in exchange for valuable con
Ktderatlon to the political forces permitting the
grant. It Is commonly b??liev??d that Mr. Platt
is afraid to testify concerning moneys he may
have re???'ire?l as a political campaigner from
per-,.us int.'rest.al in the telephone business who
bave fTo? time tO time received favors from
him in his capacity as legislative dictator. Mr.
Croker, h'ss timbi, lins not scrupled to confess
that be uses his Influence over the city govern?
ment to promote lils private business. It is the
ecu.ral conviction of the prevalence of tins?'
practices amoag the men of l?oth parties who
control law makin..' which more than anything
else arouses popular resentment against cor?
porations to a dangerous heat, it is i?-s> the
envied wealth Of great companies or the over
gwlng size of trusts which raises the spectre of
socialism than it is the apprehension that tineas
eorporstiona without souls to save or bodies to
kiek are corrupting government ainl robbing
people of the protection of their political Insti?
tutions. The wild eyed preacher of social revo?
lution ?iocs no1 menace property seriously, but
a ?growing conviction among souef nea that
corporate wealth can buy their covernniont and
that they liavc no ?.??wer to prevent It without
recourse to radical remedies does.
It la the Interested opponents of municipal
ownership Who, by showing themselves so fre?
quently instrumenta of corruption, do most to
make municipal ownership popular.
OPEXIXG THE PBILIPPINBS.
Another step in the p-fOCess of redeeming and
civilizing the Philippines Is marked in the
rresiili'iifs order to (?encrai ?'tis for the open?
ing of ports to commerce. We may not call it
a "new departure," for It is merely the con?
tinuance ainl development of the poli? y adopted
at the be-inning. It is a step forward in the
right direction, and on?' tli.it promises much
good both to the islands and to this country.
The opinion has hitherto frequently been ex*
preSBCd that the best way to occupy those isl?
ands is to occupy them. That is to say. no1
merely to overrun them with troops, however
necessary that may hi* for the suppression of
lawlessness, but to let the civil administrator
follow closely In the wake of the military
victor, and to establish ?government and in?
dustry and commerce wherever our troops have
passed ami our Sag baa been planted.
That, it may well be believed, Is the surest
way of restoring ami maintaining pcare. The
parable of the andean spirit returning wit li
sen n other and worse ones to the place when.-?'
he had been cast out Is most apt to the case.
There is no use li, simply driving out the
rebels and bandits and passing on and leering
th?' place empty. Be sure the bandits win
rotura, and the last state of the place will be
worse than Hie first. No; but when lawless
ness is expelled law is to be established.
When the plunderers and ?lestroyers are driven
away honest liulustry and commerce are to be
begun. In thal way all that is gained will be
li?'l?l fast, and will aid in the gaining of more.
Pot avery port opened to commerce and every
town well governed ami mad?- prosperous will j
servi? as I centre of law abiding and loyal in?
fluences. Nothing is mor?' rebellious than Idle?
ness and shiftlessness, and nothing more loyal
than industry ami thrift.
In tliis way. too, the t'nlti-d Stat?'?* will be
most directly fulfilling Its mission In those Isl
amis. It did not take possession of thom
merely as a bunting ground for its troops, but
as n vantage ground of peaceful, expanding an?!
protitabh? commerce. Their ooiniiuTi'i.il po?
tentialities are inc.nlciilably great, and it Is now
time they began to be realized. There Is, no
doubt, still some active field work for our tTOODI
to ?1.?. The last remains of Agulualdo'a
wretched brlg.-imlry must be suppressed prompt?
ly, sternly, remorselessly. That is, and will b<
until it is completely ?lone, the flrst and most
Imperative order of the day. Rut sufficient
progress therewith now seems to have been
maile tn permit the earnest takinc up of the
next trreat duty, nnd the ?b.ing of that is what
the President's order means.
food POISONING IN ENGLAND,
The charge <>f onwholisomeness is too often
made in foreign countries against American
food products. WV may say It Is toe often, for
three reasons In the first place, one single such
charge, if well found??', and proved rorrect. la
just one to?? many for the credit of this country
and for the prosperity Of Ita trade. In the sec
ond place, a large number of such chai*ges thus
made ar?? not well founded and cannot be
proved, but, on the contrary, ure susceptible of
disproof. And lu the third place, ami this is the
point anderpreeent consid?ration, the countries
In which such chargea are made an? themselves
by 00 lilians void of offence in this same mat
ter, and sli?.uld tims be debarred, ?m the well
approved rules of glasa houses, and of l>ots and
kettles, from ov. reensoriousness in their criti?
cisms of us.
This point Is suggested by the revelation?,
made before a departmental committee of In
qulry m Wratmloster not long ago. The medi?
cal officer of health, who is also municipal
analyst of the city of Birmingham, was among
the wini??asea He testified that he had ex?
amined 1,587 samples of milk, and had found In
ISO of them either boric acid or formaldehyde.
li? ?S71 samples of butter, I C1 COntalnod boric
add In 120 samples of oleomargarine. 101 chu
tatned boric add Ia 21 samples of nwoct food,
Bach as bacon, ham, aanssgt, etc, 13 con?
tained the same ?Inn:, at the rate of from 10
t.i 4.*, grains in the pound in oo samples of
?r? am. jam, vinegar, etc., 20 contained either
borle or salicylic add The prop-ortions of food
tims poisoned were: .Milk, n per cent; butter,
28 p?r '?nt; .nain, et?'., Kg j?.r cent; meats, M
P?r ..nt, and oleomargarine, sj poe cent. (Tht
one thing made as an bultatlon and used as a
fraud was tims the worst ,,f au; a auggestlse
fUCt.) Th?? general proportion of poisoned food
in all Classas was 90 pet cent. That, it must
be aald waa not a creditable showing, it does
not wi'll entitle tic producers ami tra.lesmeii of
the Blrmiogham district to protest against thu
unwin,I.?oneness of American food products.
We have us? d the word "pois.ui. d" ailvise.lh.
Of curse, the asea who pul these draga into
food do s., f,,r til?- parp?se of presetting the
food md they insist that the draga are han,,
1? -s. Th?- Birmingham health ?.nicer had strong
contictto-a oa that sabjoet Ha Mad s..me of
the dragged milk, got opon himself, but upon
lattens. And the kittens wasted away, and in
a f.-w weeks died Perhaps human Dables will
thrive on what will kill kittens, but he did not
think so. Og n,,. contrary, h?- gara it as his ex?
pert ?.pinion that boric 11.-id. taken Into the hu?
man stomach in the qnautittos fourni i? th?.
foods examined, would produce marked cou*
stltutlonal effects, sometime?, of a very severe
diameter, and sometimes actually fatal; ami
be attribute?! the prevalence of vnrlous grave
enteric disorders largely to this poisoning of
food lu that opinion there Is every reason
to believe he was right The man who puts
boric or salicylic aci.l or any such stuff into
food for the sake of "preserving" It ?loes not
ni. r.ly preserve It. II?- poisons It. nnd poisons
those who ?-at it.
The authority quoted found In all his re?
searches B20 samples or poisoned food. In con
scijuence only twelve men were prosecuted.
I hat s??ems a small number, unless each of thom
was responsible for tnnny of the samples.
However, it is encouraging to note that of the
twelve who were prosecuted ten were ron
vi? ted. It is commendable, too, that the opin?
ion was expressed that the use of any such
"preservatives" should be prohibited by law.
That Is the ??lily safe policy, for New-York as
well as for Birmingham.
THE SC EXE OF AVAR.
British war maps need enlarging. We have
a fine collection of them, but not one Is of
sen ice at the present time. Not ono of them
shows where the latest fighting occurred. They
all show the Transvaal on a good soalo and
with much detail, and the Orange Uiver Free
Slate Hut there is no war In those countries
at tills time. They also show the upper part
of Natal, but neither Is there much Interest In
that region. All the British were driven out of
it long ago. BOOM <>f ?them show Kimberley
ami Mafeking, ami to that extent are servi???
able when then- is any n?-ws from tho neigh?
borhood of those placea, which Is not often just
now. Bat tiny tn "H cat off at the (?range
River, .is though Hie war was not under any
circumstances to extend below it. They show
.Miwal North and Ootosberg, of course, since
those places are i&Ott to the border. Rut of
Moiicno and Sterkstrom and the rest there is
no sign.
Yet it Is away down there in Tape Colony
thal present interest centres. It is there that
Genera] Oatacre has been getting Into a hor?
net's nest, and losing men and guns and ground
at a disastrous rat?'. (Jeiieial (iatacre started,
lie tells us, to attack Stormberg. One vfonl'l
suppose that to !>?? a I.oer town, or a town on
Boer soil. On the contrary, it Is a town, or a
railroad junction of importance, In Tape Colony,
some fifty miles BOOth of the (?range Uiver. Ho
is sending some of lils troops back to Stork?
strom "to ?recuperate.*' That place Is thirty
miles farther south. As for tin? wounded, they
muet go to Queenstown, which is more than a
hundred miles from the river, and more than
half way down to the coast.
In such fashion have the Hoers forced the
fighting ?in British soil. In Natal they have
marebed more than half way down to the coast.
ami in (ape ?Colony itself they liare ?lone nearly
ai welL 1 bet may not capture I ?urban or Capo
Town, but tiny have alrea?ly come nearer to
doing so than the British have to eating their
(Christmas dinners In Pretoria.
THE BASEBALL CONVENTION.
The annual convention of the National League
of Baseball Clubs began In this city yesterday,
representatives of all the twelve being In at?
tendance, and all resolved as usual, to elevate
the game. One of the chief i-uostions to be de?
cided Is whether or not the circuit shall be re
dined to eight clubs, and out of that whatever
excitement attends the uiei'tiiig will probably be
?lev? loped It Is quite likely that such a reduc?
tion would be a good thlog, but it Is a point that
the general pilbil??, which was formerly lnt?-r
ested in baseball and would like to become so
again, cares comparatively little about. The
managers can ?a t as warm oret It as they please
nnd settle it to suit themselves. The question
that concerns respectable oataldere is how the
game Is to be managed and playo?! whether It
is to continu?' lu lis ?.res. ?it state of degradation
or be restori ?1 t.. a condition of decency.
Th.' managers, and especially the local mnn
ager, say that they aro most desirous to revive
popular interest In professional ha-.-hall In this
vicinity, or, more properly, in this borough.
There Is nothing novel or stnrtllng In that an?
nouncement, it wnilli naturally bo supposed
that tiiey would like to bare tbdr sport attended
by ?.Teat numb? is of enthoslastic spectators.
And yet the ia? t is liiat some of ti., in have dur?
um' several yean b? n doing just about .ill they
COUM to kill the Interest on which th? ir prosper
l ty dependa The time wai wheo games of base
ban constantly drew a multitud?? of respectable
persons to witness them, and conferre?] a large
amount of pleasure and positive benet't. The
open nil* and tin? exhilaration of ths sport wen?
both ai*r?-eal)le and healthful, and there were
few Immoral Influences and associations to off?
set the ?prod Nbbody need* d to feel ?shamed of
1 ila Interi'st ??r his SUITOUndinga who had the
time and the inclination to see an excellent form
of physi??ai competition skilfully exemplified ?
lu recent year*, in this city, ami too often else?
where, all this has been changed by the consent
ami actual contrivance of managen. Pledges
ami regulation? in the interest of fairness ainl
decency have uniformly bet n adopted in conven?
tion, only to be contemptuously broken In tin?
field throughout the ensuing season. Profes?
sional baseball bas becnie n barbarous sport,
abounding in turbulence ainl vulgarity, and Its
reputable support has shrunk to small propor?
tions, n is cause for serious regret that such
should in: th?- fa? t, but the truth of th.- ?h-scrip
tiOO cannot be denied It must be obvious that
any manager, whatever his personal propensi?
ties may be, is a fool to contribute to such a rc
tolt ?T to stay in tie busin.-ss if be s?-cs no
chance of improved conditions. Doubtless tha
members of the pr?sent convention will pass ,?.
Collent reoolutlona In restraint of violence nnd
Indecency. Hut how mach will they nenn?
'?hat is the one r?uo<?tlon which really interests
the respectable baseball loren of a past era.
There are ttousnjsdl of them who would like to
? ojoy the game .main, but -arba will not give it
their countenance until it has been restored io
tH?niethiug like ?is former stains.
Tho Indications are that the Oovernor de?
rived more pleastjr* from that Fifth Avenue
Hotel conference kurt ?saturday than anybody
elee who was In attendance.
Mr. Moss Is under the Impression that th?
work of the Mazet Committee will necessarily
furnish the basis for such a revision of the
charter aa th?? Governor's Commission may
nKr.-e B] on. The prevalent opinion, on the con*
dary, is that th?? investigation will cut a wmall
flj?ure In tho Commission's proceedings. It may
be a pity, but that Is the fact.
If the nehool unification commission attempts
too much it is rather likely to aecompllsh less
than nothing.

THE TALK OF THE DAY.
The Rev. Dr. L, C. Broughton, of Atlanta. C,n ,
who recently preached In the Hanson P?aos Baptist
eli jr. h. H:..klyn. having heard that some of his
hearers thought his preaching too harsh, has ma Is
the following reply to the criticism: "I have no
doubt tho new religion Is more aceptable to many
New-Yorkers and Boatoniana than the old. The
suggestion that Hosten has substituted sheol for the
orthodox place may furnish comfort.il? 1" food for

mt. PAbEKBV? SKI'S RET?BN.
After an absence of three years and n half Mr.
Pad? " ?-ki n turns to Amerlea. It was made evi?
dent at his flrst recital, given yesterday afternoon
al ? atr.egl?' Hall, that he steps at once Into the
alan in the public's admiration and esteem that
he left at his departure. That place has always
been a curious one; the various forces that have
?o-operated to make It for him are fraught with
mueh that Is good for the art of music, and cheer?
ing to those who have It, and have Its best Inter?
ests at heert; while at the same time there Is In
them an element that mak^s for the Injury of the
tri one that represent? some of the worst ten?
dencies of the modern attitude toward music and
the Interpreters of It. The unthinking exaltation
of the artist's personality and the lamentable and
absurd aberrations which It has been Mr. Paderew
skl's lot to arouse? unwillingly, on the part of ?o
great an artist, we are fain to belleve-have not
Injured his art; but what effect they have had
outside of hjs own artistic consclenee might bi a
question for serious discussion. These things vere
painfully In evidence yesterday nftersoon. It Is
more agreeable to note at the same time that the
great planl-H had lost none of the mastery they
gave him at his earlier triumphs; that his sway
over the discerning and the sympathetic was ps
potent as It ever was, that the magic of his genius
has all the searching power and the Irresistible
charm that have put him In a pla?N hy hin ?*|f
among the world's great interpreters of great
music
Mr. PsdsrSWShfa art Is the same in all Its
salient and characteristic feature? as when he
las! revsatsd It to this public It may have broad?
cued anil d? .-pined somewhat, it may have ed?
vanced !n some of its more slgnltVant elements
there will ba opportunity later to confirm that
?potni hut his Ideal? and alms In the reproduc?
tion of the music he sets U fore himself, his point
of view, aro Charly the same. All he does l.i
guld? d bj? his Intense lind penetrating romantic
feeling, the atmosphere of lyric poetry envelop??;
lils \w.rk. II?- moves always on an exalted plan.?
Of emotional power. Always subordina!? ?1 to th??
expression of this Ideal is his surpassing tech
rrlquf and It wes never more brilliant, mo ? -
cure, more adequate St every point, more per?
fectly moulded lo bia uses, than It was yesterday.
The pianists whose specialty It Is to play louder, or
softer, or faster, than most others, are all put
?1 twn Into their proper places hy the musicanshlp
"1' thla man, who, after all Is said and done, holds
his listeners captive by the sheer beauty and
poetry of hU performances, and makes all elae
aiihsldiary matter.
Mr. I'aderewski le still pre-eminently a worker
In tonal color; never has the pianoforte heen made
to yield more v.irlety, more different kinds of
sensuous loveliness, more poignant expressions In
IhS singing voice of the Instrument, than under
his fingers. Witness the cantablle. of the nocturne
by Chopin; of the A flat major ballade, of the
thirteenth etiule In the set op. 10, that he played
yesterday. In th<?lr ?ort It would be Impossible to
Imagtn? anything of more consummate perfection.
This was always a foremost element In his playing
perhapa he has made it more so to-day than
ever before-and It Is the one on which he seems
to dwell most lovingly and most anxiously. There
were, Ind? cr], times when the quality of his tone
gave his admirers some uneasiness?It was in the
passages of strenuous fortissimo, when the In
Strument sseaMd forced sometimes beyond Its
power to respond. The reason for It was difficult
to un?lerrtan?l. for su. h things are not Included In
the -?cope of Mr. Paderewskl's scheme of tone pro?
duction.
The finish and maturity of Mr. Paderewskl's play?
ing ns to phrasing, adjustment of dynamic nuance.
ths attalantont Of climaxes, Kfllsn-**l and logical de?
velopment of idea stand, as It seems, raised to a
higher power than ever before. The student can
pej ei?,e the calculated nicety of his phrasing, the
perfect symmetry of his nuances, the absolute pre?
cision with which the intended effect Is reached;
hut It Is an art that conceals art and that gives the
sympathetic listener the supreme satisfaction that
only the highest repose and most perfect poise can
convey. With all of Mr. Paderewskl's readings,
h.,w\??r, it Is no more possible to agree now than
in other years. There are regions where his art
gives the Inevitable expression of the essence of
the music; there are others wher? it does not carry
conviction. He ha? put great Interpretations of
Beethoven's sonatas to his credit, n?)t.ibly of some of
ihe later ones, that have become as enduring monu?
ments to those who heard them; but his perform?
ance of the Sonata Appasslonata will not rank
among these. It Is not cast in a large enough
mould, and It lacks the accents of tragic power.
Bo, too, In the Fantasie of Schumann ho did not
quite reach to th" heroic stature of the work, hu?
read into It a sentlm??nt that is not there. But the
n nervations with which his performance yester?
day afternoon must be taken are exhausted with
this enumeration, nnd the rest was an unalloyed
joy. Of th.? glamour of his Chopin playing we have
already spoken. Ills playing of that master's
polonslse, <?p. tt, In some ways marked the summit
of his achievement? he sounded the ?lepths of its
gloom and passion, and his expression of Its sweep
and pow.r was of irresistible eloquence. His
Strauss-Tauslg waltz sparkle?! and shimmered, and
In the Us?t rhapsody -the inevitable was No. 6 this
Mm?" h" delighted In presenting some of his most
striking and original efTeets. In Juggling with timbre
and color and planlstle effects that none have
mastereil as he has. His Bach prelude and fugue
were charged with a modern spirit of romance that
well became the earliest romantic composer, and
the fugue was a beautiful piece of contrapuntal ex?
position.
When he had finished his programme he was
called on f'ir more amid scen??s ?>f enthusiasm
reminiscent of previous years of ? onquest over the
impressionable feminine. He playel flrst Chopin's
A flat wallz. then a pianoforte setting of the march
fr.'in Beethoven's "Hulns of Athens." and there
were many who waited In the throng about the
pla I form? to Insist on hla adding a third number,
and were successful.

Berlin, Dec 12 During the debate In the Rslehs?

mates, lir. Lieber, who apparently was not Incon?
venlerv el by his encounter with a. supposed maniac,
observed that ths favorable finan? lal situation was'
due to the careful manner in which th? Hous*
?crutlnUed th<? Budget. The "Prussian financial
Juggler" (Dr. Von Mlquel?, he further remaiked,
had "based ihe estimates of permanent expenditure
on fluctuating revenues." This, according to the
speaker, was Impolitic, and a heavy penalty would
have to be paid for It some day. The Centrists, he
continued, were of the opinion that the Govern,
rnent's requirements could be met without r<sc?, -r..j,
to fresh tnxation. At present ho was not prepared
to say whether or not he would support the naval
bill. Th?? declaration of th? Government, tho
speaker claimed, would have had great weight If it
had not been given publicity beforehand, thus
slighting the Reichstag. Dr. (JSfcSr, In conclusion,
snld that past and future events would prove to th?
