W.A HHnvfiToN, Due. 4.—The second
session of
the Fifty-third CODirress
opened very quietly. Indeed, it was a
"subject of general remark that, in view
of the number and importance of mat
ters of legislation expectcd to make
the Fifty-third congress memorable in
the economic history of the country,
there was a remarkable lack of public
interest exhibited on this the opening
day. When the gavel fell and congress
began its session the galleries were
scarcely mora than half filled.
CONGRESSIONAL PROCEEDINGS
The House.
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.—At ono minute
after l2 -o clock the speaker called the
house to order and prayer was offered by
the chaplain, who touchingly referred
to the death and Ion# public service of
Representative O'Xeil of Pennsylvania.
The roll was then called to ascertain the
presence of quorum.
The roll call disclosed the presence of
342 members and the speaker declared the
house ready for the transaction of busi
ness.
The following committee was appointed
by the speaker to wait upon the president
and Inform him that the house was ready
for any communication he might wish to
make Messrs. Wilson, deni., West Vir
ginia Outhwaite, deni., Ohio, and Bur
rows, rep., Michigan.
Mr. lllncs, dem., Pennsylvania, offered
a resolution providing that a committee
be appointed to investigate thie existing
strike on the Lehigh Valley ^railroad, its
causes and effect, and if possible to sug
gest a remedy. The house then at 12:55
took a recess for fifteen minutes.
At 1 6 p. m. Executive Clerk Pruden
appeared tn tlio house and delivered the
president's message.
The elerk was directed by the speaker
to read the message.
At 5i p. in. the reading of the presi
dent's message was concluded, having oc
cupied one hour and twenty minutes
time. At8 lo p. m. the house adjourned.
The Senate.
WASHINGTON, DCC. 4.—The senate was
called to order promptly at noon and after
prayer Senators MePherson and Sherman
were nppoiuted a committee on behalf of
the senato to wait on the president and
notify him that congress wns ready to re
ceive any communication he migh make.
The senate then, at i:
10, took a recess
for oue hour. This will delay the recep
tion of the message in the senate until
after 1 p. m.
When the senate was called to order a
message was received from the house an
nouncing a quorum and the appointment
of its committee. A further recess was
then taken until 1
:S0 p. m.
At 1:3b p. m. the committee notified the
Senate that the president would immedi
ately submit a communication in writing
and Major Pruden at the same time ap
peared and presented the message.
The reading of the message was con
cluded at 8 o'clock, but Senator Dolph,
rep., Oregon, called attention to the fact
that the reader had skipped page 0 con
taining the references to Hawaii and the
vice president directed that the omitted
page be read.
The President's Messa^.
To the Congress of the United States:
The constitutional duty which requires
the president from time to. time to give
to the congress information of the state
of the union and recommend to their
consideration such laws as he shall judge
neccssary is fittingly entered upon by
commending to the congress a careful
recommendation of the detailed state
ments and well supported recommenda
tions contained in the reports of the heads
of departments who are chiefly charged
with the executive work of the govern
ment. In an effort to abridge this com
munication as much as is consistent
*ith its purpose I shall
supplement a brief reference with the
contents of these departmental reports by
the motion of such executive business
and incidenst as are not embraced therein,
and by such recommendations as appear
to De at this particular time appropriate.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Patrick Egan's Course in the Imbroglio With
Chile Sharply Critlcis id.
While cur foreign relations have not at
all times during the past year been en
tirely free from perplexity, no embarrass
ing situations remain that will not yield
to the splritof fairness and love of justicc,
which, joined with consistent firmness,
characterizes the truly American foreign
policy.
Mv predecessor having accepted the
ofhee of arbitrator of the long standing
boundary dispute, tendered to the presi
dent bv the Argentine Republic and
rar.il, it has been my
agreeable duty to re
ceive the special envoys commissioned by
these states to lay before me evidence
and arguments in behalf of their respect
ive governments.
The outbreak of domestic hostilities in
the republic of Brazil found the United
States alert to watch the interests of our
citizens in that country, with which we
carry on important commerce. Several
vessels of our new navy are now and for
some time have been stationed at Rio de
Janeiro. The struggle being between
the established government which con
trols the machinery of the administration,
and with which we maintain friendly re
lations, and certain officers of the navy
employing the vessels of their command
In an attack upon the national capital and
chief seaport, and lacking as it does the
elements of divided administration, I have
failed to see that the insurgents can rea
sonably claim recognition as belligerents
This is the position of our government—
that of an attentive, but impartial ob
server of the unfortunate conflict. Em
phasizing our fixed policy of impartial
neutrality iu such a condition of
affairs as now exists, I deemed
It neccssary to disavow in a
manner not to be misunderstood the un
authorized action of tlio late naval com
mander of those waters in saluting tho
revolting Brazilian admiral, being indis
posed to countenance nn act calculated to
give gratuitous sanction to the local in
surrection.
The Chile Row.
The convention between our govern
ment and Chile having for its objeet the
settlement and adjustment of the demands
of tho two countries against each other
lias been made effective by the organiza
tion of the claims commission provided for.
The two governments falling to agree
upon the third member of the commission,
the good ofilces of tbo president of the
Swiss republic were Invoked as provided
in the treaty and the selection of the
Swiss representative in that country to
complete the organization was gratifying
to the United States and Chile. The
vexatious question of so-called legation
as lum for offenders against the state
nnd its laws was prosentcd anew in Chile
bv the unauthorized action of the late
United States minister in receiving in his
ofiicial residence two persons who had
failed ID an attempt at revolution and
against whom criminal charges were

pending growing out of a former abortive
disturbance.
The doctrine of asylum as applied to
this case is not sanctioned by the best
precedent, and when allowed tends to en
courage sedition and strife. Under no
circumstances can tli2 representatives of
government be permitted, under the
ill-defined fiction of extra territorality, to
interrupt the administration of criminal
justice in the countries to which tlier *re
accredited. A temperate demand having
been made by the Chilean government for
the correction of this conduct in the In*
stance mentioned the minister was ltv
structed no longer to harbor the offender.
The Honduras Incident.
Upon receiving authentic-information
of the firing upon an American
mail steamer touching at the
port of Amapala because her
captain refused to deliver up a passenger
in transit from Nicaragua Guatemala
upon the demand of the military authori
ties of illonduras, our minister to that
country, under instructions, protested
against the wantou act aud demanded sat
isfaction. The government of Honduras,
actuated by a sense of justicc and in a
spirit of the utmost friendship, promptly
disavowed the illegal conduct of its offi
cers and expressed sincere regret for the
occurrence. It is confidently antici
pated that a satisfactory adjustment will
soon be reached of the questions arising
out of the seizure and use of American
vessels by insurgents in Honduras and the
subsequent denial by the successful gov
ernment of commercial privileges to these
vessels on that account.
Samoa.
Led by a desire to contribute to tho res
toration of order in £amoa, which for some
years previous had been the
scene of coillct
ing foreign pretensions and native strife,
the United States, departing from its pol*
icy consecrated by a century of observ
ance, entered four years ago into the
treaty of Berlin, thereby becoming jointly
bound with England and Germany to es
tablish and maintain Malletoa as king of
Samoa. The treaty provided for a foreign
court of justice, a municipal council for
tlio district of Apia, with a for
eign president thereof authorized to
advise the king, a tribunal for
the settlement of native and
foreign land titles, and a revenue system
for the kingdom. It entailed upon tho
three powers that part of the cost of the
new government not met by the revenue
of the islands. Early in the life of this
triple protectorate the native dissensions
it was designed to quell, revived. Rivals
defied the authority of the king, refusing
to pay taxes and demanding the election
of a ruler by native suffrage. Mataafa,
an aspirant to tbc throne, and a large
number of the native adherents were in
open rebellion on ono of the Islands. Quite
lately, at the request of the other
powers and in fulfillment of its treaty
obligation this government agreed
to unite in a joiut military movement of
such dimensions as would probably se
cure the surrender of the insurgents
without bloodshed. The warship Phila
delphia was accordingly put under orders
for Samoa, but before she arrived the
threatened conflict was precipitated by
King Malietoa's attack ou the insurgent
camp. Mataafa was defeated and a num
ber of men killed. The British and Ger
man naval vessels present subsequently
secured the surrender of Mataafa and his
adherents. The defeated chief and ten of
his principal supporters were deported to
a German island of the Marshall group,
where tlicy are held as prisoners under
the joint responsibility and court of the
decrce powers.
This incident and the events leading up
to it signnlly illustrates the impolicy of
entangling alliances with foreign powers.
HAWAIIAN COMTROVERSY.
The Presldjnt Has Implicit Confidence in
Blount.
It Is hardly necessary for me to state
that the questions arising from our rela
tions with Hawaii have caused serious
embarrassment. Just prior to the in
stallation of tho present administration
the existing government of Hawaii had
been suddenly overthrown and a treaty
of annexation had been negotiated be
tween the provisioual government of the
islands and tho United States and sub
mitted to the senate for ratification. This
treaty I withdrew for examination and
dispatched Hon. James H. Blount of
Georgia to Honolulu as a special commis
sioner to make an impartial investigation
of the circumstances attending the
change of government and of all the con
ditions bearing upon the subject of the
treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive
examination Mr. Blount submitted to
me his report, showing beyond
all question that tho contitutional
government of Hawaii had been subverted
with the active aid of our representative
to that government and through the in
timidation caused by the presence of an
armed naval force of the United States
which was landed for that purpose at the
instance of our minister. Upon the facts
developed it seemed to me the only hon
orable course for our government to pur
sue was to undo the wrong that had been
done by those representing us and to re
store as far as practicable the status ex
isting at the time of our forcible interven
tion. With a view of accomplishing this
result within the constitutional limits of
the executiue power, and recognizing
all our obligations and responsibilities
growing out of any changed condition
brought about by our unjustifiable inter
ference, our present minister at Honolulu
has received appropriate instructions to
that end. Thus far no information of the
accomplishment of any definite results
has been received from him. Additional
advices are soon expected. When re
ceived they will be promptly sent to the
congress, together with all other infor
mation at hand, accompanied by a special
executive message fully detailing all the
facts neccssary to a complete understand
ingof the case, and presenting a history
of all the material events looking up to
the present situation.
TREASURER'S REPORT.
A Deficiency of $28,000,000 Estimated for
the Year 1894.
The secretarj' of the treasury reports that
the receipts of the government from all
sources during the fiscal year ended Jutic
30, 1893, amounted to $161 716.501.94, and
its expenditures to $459,374,674.29. There
was (collected from enstoms $205,0^0,000
and from internal revenues $161,027,623.93.
Our dutiable imports amounted to 9421,
856,711, an increase of $ 5i,463,907 over the
preceding year, and imports free of duty
amounted to $444,544,211, a decrease from

than any previous year in the history of
this government, amounting to $108,^80,
£44, and exceeding the amount exported
during the preceding year by $58,485,5(7.
The sum paid from the treasury for
sugar bounty was *9,375,130.88, an increase
over the preceding year of $2,083,053.09.
It is estimated upon the basis of present
revenue laws that the receipts of tbo gov
ernment for the year ending June 30, 18J4,
will be $430,121,365.38 and its expenditures
$458,121,305.38, resulting In a deficiency of
$28,000,00j.
On the 1st day of November, 1893, the
amount of money of all kinds in circula
tiou or not lucludcd in treasury holdings
was $1,718,544,682. An increase for the
year of $112,401,947. Estimating our pop
ulation at 67,426.0J0, at the time mentioned
the per capita circulation was$:5.49. On
the same date there was in the treasury
gold bullion amounting to $90,657,'^73 and
silver bullion which was purchased at a
cost of $126,261,553.
Silver Purchases and Coinage.
The purchases of silver uuder the law
of July 14, 1890, during tho last fiscai
year aggregated 54,008,162.59 fine ounces,
which cost #45,531,Sr4.53. The total
amount of silver purchased from the* time
that law became operative until the re
peal of its purchasing ciausc, on the 1st
day of November, 189 was 168,674,590.46
fine ounces, which cost $155,910,910.84.
Between the 1st day of March, 1878, and
tho 1st day of November, 1S93, the govern
ment purchased under all laws 603,003,717

from such coinage was 89, leav*
ing on hand iu the mints H0,G9D,700 fine
ounces of silver, which cost $126,678,218.
Last Year's Total Coinage.
Our total coinage of all metals during
the last fiscal year consisted of $7,280*875
pieces.valued at 85,178.80* of which
there was £KO,033,14J in gold coin* $5*343,715
in silver dollars. 17*217.220*00 In subsidiary
silver colh and (1,080,102.90 in minor
coins.
During the calendar year of 18G3 the
production of precious metals in the
united States was estimated to bo 1,5U6,*
875 fine ounces of gold of the commercial
and coinage value of $38,000,0 0, and 58,
000,(00 fine ounces of silver of the bullion
or market value of $5i\750,000 and of the
coinage value of $4,P89,900.
It Is estimated that on the first day of
July, 1893, tho metallic stock of money in
the United States, consisting of coin and
bullion, amounted to $1,218,550,100. of
which $07,897,085 was gold and $015,801,
484 was silver.
National Banks.
One hundred and nineteen national
banks were organized during tho year
eliding November 1, 1893, with a capital of
$U,28J,000. Forty-six went into volun
tary liquidation and 158 suspended 05 of
the suspended banks were insolvent, 80
resumed business and 7 remain in the
hands of bank examiners, with
prospects of speedy resumption.
Of the new banks organized 44
wero located in the eastern states, 41
west of tho Mississippi river and
?4 in the central and southern
states. The total number of national
banks in existence on-the 3i8t day of Oc
tober, 1898, was 8,790, having an aggre
gate capital of $695*558,120. The net in
crease in the circulatiou of these bauks
during the year was $16,880,972.
Repeal of the Purchasing Clause.
The recent repeal of tho provision of
the law requiring the purcV^ase of silver
bullion by the government as a feature of
our monetary scheme has made an entire
change In the complexion of our currency
affairs. I do not doubt but that the ulti
mate result of this action will be
most salutary and far reaching.
In the nature of things, however, it is im
possible to know at this time precisely
what conditions will bo brought about by
the change or what, if any, supplement*
ary legislation may in the light of such
conditions appear to be essential or expe
dient. Of course, after the recent finan
cial perturbation, time is necessary for the
re-establishment of business confidence.
When, however, through this restored
confidence tho money which has been
frightened into hoarding places is re
turned to trade and enterprise a
survey of the situation will prob
ably disclose a safe path leading to a
permanently sound currency, abundantly
sufficient to meet every requirement of
our increasing population and business.
In the pursuit of this object wo should res
olutely turn away from alluring and tem
porary expedients, determined to be con
tent with nothing leas than a lasting and
comprehensive financial plan. In these
circumstances I am convinced that a
reasonable delay in dealing with the sub
ject instead of being injurious will in
crease the probability of wise action.
The monetary conference which as
sembled at Brussels upon our invitation
was adjourned to the 30th day
of November iu tho present year.
The considerations just stated and tho
fact that a definite proposition from us
seemed to be expectcd upon the reassem
bling of the conference led me to express
a willingness to have the meeting still
further postponed. It seems to me that
it would be wise to give general author
ity to the president to invite other nations
to such a conference at any time wht\p
there should be a. fair prospect of accom
plishing an international agreement.
Govarnmant Bonds.
On the subject of coinage I desire also
to earnestly suggestthe wisdom of amend*
ing ihc existing statutes in regard to
the issuanco of government bonds.
The authority now vested in the secretary
of the treasury to issue bonds is not so
clear as it should be and the bonds author
ized are disadvantageous, to the govern
ment both as to the timoof their maturity
and rate of interest.
Immigration,
The superintendent of immigration,
through tue secretary of the treasury, re
ports that during the last fiscal veariherc
arrived at our ports 44'.793 immigrants
of these 1,003 were not permitted to land
under tho limitations of the law and 557
were returned to the couutrics from
whence they came by reason of their
having become publlo charges. The
total arrivals were 140,031 less
than for the previous year.
The secretary in his report gives an ac
count of the operation of the niariue hos
pital service and of the good work done
under its supervision, preventing the en
trance and spread of contagious diseases.
The admonitions of the last two years
touching our public health and the dem
onstrated danger of the introduction of
contagious diseases from foreign ports
has invested tho subject of national quar
anntine with increased interest A more
general aud harmonious system than now
exists, acting promptly and directly
everywhere, and constantly operating by
preventive means to shield our country
from the invasion of disease, and at the
same time having due regard to the rights
and duties of local agencies, would, I be
lieve, add greatly to tho safety of our
people.
WAR DEPARTMENT.
Strength of the Army-Increased Interest in
the State Militia.
The secretary of war reports that the
strength of the army on th 30th day oi
September last was 25,778 enlisted men
and 2,144 ofiicers. The total expenses ol
this department for the year ending June
30, 15J93, amounted to *$51,960,740 98. Ol
this sum $i,992.501.9" was for salaries and
contingent expenses. $2., fo*
the support of the military es
tablishment, $6,077,033.18 for mis
ce)laneou9 objects and $20,518,631.41
for public works. This latter sum in
cluded $l5,296,b76.46 for river and harbot
improvements and $3,266,141.20 for fortill
cations and other works of defense.
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S REPOR1
A Plea for the Abolishment of the Fee Sys
tem in Federal Courts.
The report of the attorney general eon
tains the usual summary of the affair*
and proceedings of the department ol
justice for the past year, together with
certain recommendations as to needed
legislation on various subjects. I cannot
too heartily indorse the proposition thai
the fee system as applicable to tho com
pensation of United states attorneys,
marshals, clerks of federal courts and
United States commissioners should bi
abolished with as llttlo delay as possible.
It is clearly in tho interest of the com*
munity that the business of the courts,
both civil and criminal, shall be as small
and as inexpensively transacted ni
the ends of justice will allow.
The system therefore is thoroughly
vicious which make^ tho compensation oi
court officials depend upon the volume ol
such business and thus creates a conflict
between the proper exeecutlon of the law
and private gain, which cannot fail to b«
dangerous to tho rights and freedom ol
the citizens, an irresistablc temptation t«
the unjustifiable expenditure of public
funds. If in addition to this reform an
other was inaugurated which would give
to United States commissioners the final
disposition of petty offenses within the
grade of misdemeanors, especially thos«
coming under the internal revenue
laws, a great advance would bi
made toward a more decent ad
ministration of the criminal laws
In my first message to congress, dated De*
ember 8, 1885, I strongly recommendec
these changes and referred somewhat a)
length to the evils of tho recent system.
Since that time the criminal business oi
the federal courts and the expense attend
ing it have enormously increased. Thi
number of criminal prosecutions pendini
in the circuit aud district courts of tin
United States on the 1st day of July, 18SS
was 3,8'J8, of which 1,^81 were «for viola
tionsof the internal revenue laws, whil«
the number of such prosecutions pend
ing on the 1st day of July, I893i
was 9,500, of which 4.200 were for violatioi
of the internal revenue laws. The ex
pense of the United States courts, exclu
sive of judges' salurles, for tho year end
ing July J, 1885, was $3,874,733.11 and foi
the year ending July 1, 1893, $4,58^656.87.
TWELFTH YEAR KIMBALL, BRULB COUNTY, SOUTH DAKOTA. SATURDAY. DEC. 9. 1893 WHOLE NUMBER «10.
ft is therefore apparent that the reasons
given in 1885 for a change in the manner
Df euforclng the federal criminal law have
gained coger* *y and strength by the lapse
rftiuie.
I alao heartily join the attorney gen
eral in recommending legislation fixing
the degrees of the crime of murder within
federal Jurisdiction, as has been done in
many of tho states authorising Writs of
error on behalf of the government in
cases where final judgment is rendered
against the sufficiency of an igdiotment
or against tho government upon any
other question arising before actual trial
limiting the right of review in cases of
felouy punishable only by fine and im
prisonment to the circuit court of appeals
and making speedy provish for the con
struction of such prisons and reforma
tories as may be necessary for the con
finement of United States convicts.
POSrOFrtCE DEPARTMENT.
The Postmaster General Estimate* There
Will Be an $8,000,000 Ceficbncy.
The report of the postmaster general
contalus a detailed statemcntof the opera*
tions of the postoffica department during
the last fiscal year and much interesting
information touching this Important
branch of the public service. The busi
ness of the mails indicates with absolute
certainty the condition of the business of
the country, and depression in financial
affaii's inevitably and quick}? reduces the
postal revenues. There was a larger dis
crepancy than usual between the post*
office receipts and expenditures, being the
expcctcd and unavoidable result of the dis
tressing stringency which has prevailed
throughout the country liuriug
much of the time covered
by tho postmaster general's report.
At a date when better times were antici
pated it was estimated by his predecessor
that the deficiency on tho 30th day of
•Tune, 1893, would be but a little over
$1,500,000. It amounted, however, to more
that '5,000,000. At the same time aud under
the influence of like anticipations esti
mates were made for tho current fiscal
year ending June DO, 1894, which exhibited
a surplus of revenue over expenditures of
(872,215.71. Hut now,in view of the actual
receipts and expenditures during that
part of the current fiscal year already ex
pired, the postmaster general estimates
that at its close instead of a surplus there
will be a deficiency of nearly $^,nu0*000.
The postofiiee receipts for the last fiscal
year amounted to $75,896,933.15 and its ex
penditures to $81,074,104.90. This post
office deficiency would disappear or be
immeusely decreased if less matter was
carried free through the mails, an item
of which is upward of *-00 tons of seeds
and grain from tho agricultural depart
ment.
The total number of postoffices in the
•United States on the 80tli day of June, 1893,
was 68,403, an increase of 1,284 over the
preceding year. Of these, 3,860 were presi
dential offices, an Increase in that class
of 204 over the preceding year.
Forty-two free delivery offices were
added during the j'ear to those already
existing* making a total of 610 cities and
towns provided with free delivery on
June 30, 1893. Ninety-three, other cities
and towns are now entitled to this service
under the law, but it has not been ac
corded them on account of insufficient
funds to meet tho expense of its estab
lishment. I am decidedly of the opinion
that the provisions of the present law per
mit as general au introduction of this fea
ture of mail service as is necessary or Jus
tifiable and that it ought not to be ex
tended to smaller communities than arc
now designated.
The expense of free delivery for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1894", will be
more than $11,0 0,0i0, and under legisla
tion now existing there must be a con
stant iucrease in this item of expendi
ture.
Monfy Ordar Offices.
There were 6,101 additions to the domes
tic money order ofiices during tho last
fiscal year, being the largest increase in
any year since the inauguration of the
system. The total number of these
offices at the close of the year was 18,434.
There were 13,3.9,735 money orders issued
from these offices, being an increase over
the preceding year of 1,240, 90, aud the
value of these orders amounted to $127,
576,438.65, an iucrease of $7,509,632.58.
There were also issued during the year
postal notes amounting to $12,903,076.75.
During the year 195 international
money order offices were added to those
already provided, making a total of 2.4 7
in operation ou June 30. 1893 The num
ber of international money orders issued
during the year was 1,055,999, an increase
over tho preceding year of 72,5if», and
their value was $16,341,837.86, an increase
of $1,221,5' 6.31. The number of orders paid
was 80.,917, an increase over the preced

$5,283,875.70, an increase of S'^O'.^.hS.
From the foregoing statements it appears
that tho total issue of money orders and

$156,b2l,«48.24.
The number of letters and packages

NAVY DEPARTMENT.
Progress in the Building of Naw Vessels
Not So Rapid as Expected.
The report of tlie secretary of the
uavy contains a history of the operations
of liis deiiiirtnicnt durinjr the past vear
anil exhibits a most gratifying condition
of the personnel of our navy. He pre
sents a satisfactory account of pro^r^ss
which lias been made in the construction
of vessels anil makes a number
of recommendations, to which
attention is especially invited.
Uurinjf tho past six months tho demands
for cruising- vessels have been many and
ur^flit. There liavo been revolutions,
callinff for vessels to protect American
Interests in Nii-aragua. Guatemala, Costa
Kica, Honduras, Argentina and Brazil,
while the condition of affairs in Honolulu
lias required the constant presence of one
or more ships. With all these calls upofi
our navy It bceamc necessary in order to
make up a sufficient llect to patrol the
Bering1 sea under the modus vlvendi
agreed upon with Great Britain
to detail to that service one
vessel from the fl.li commis
sion and three from the revenue marine.
Progress in tho construction of new ves
sels has not boen as rapid as' was antici
pated. There liavo been delays in the
completion of unarmed vessels, but for
the most part they have been such as are
constantly occurring, even in countries
having the largest experience in naval
ship building. Tho most serious delays,
however, have been in the work upon
armored .ships. The trouble has been
the failure of contractors to deliver ar
mor as agreed. The oifllcultics seem
now, liowover, to have been all
overcome and armor is being
delivered with satisfactory promptness.
As a result of the experience acquired bj
the shipbuilders aud designers and the
workmen, it is bolievcd that tho dates
when vessels will be completed can now
be estimated with reasonable accuraev.
Great guns, rapid iirlng guns, torpedoes
and powder are being promptly supplied.
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
Over Nino Hundred and Fifty Thousand on
the Pension Rolls,
Tho secretary of the Interior has the
supervision of so many important sub
jects that his report is of espccial value
and interest. On tho 80th day of June,
ItSUB, there wero on the pension rolls ttOO,-than
013 names, an incrsase of a'1,914 over
tlie number on the rolls June, .30, 18^2.
Of these there were 17 widows and daugh
ters of revolutionary soldiers, ML sur
vivors of the war of 181?, .1,425 widows of
soldiers of that war, 21,518 survivors and
widows of the Mexican war, il8,S22 sur
vivors aud widows of Indian wars, 2S1
army nurses and 4T6,0*i survivors and
widows and children of deceased soldiers
and sailors of tho war of tho rebellion.
The Salter number represents thoso pen
sioned on account of disabilities and
death resulting from army and navy
service. Tli« number of pc-sons remain
ing on tlie rolls June 30, 180 !. who wero
pensioned under the act of June 27 189'
which allows pensions on account of
death and disabilities not chargeable to
army service, was 591 .SSfi.
imtrall AJfaptric.
THE ONLY STRICTLY MORAL PAPER IN SOUTH DAKOTA. $2.00 Per Year. Q1.60 In Advance.
The number added to the rolls during the
year was 129*534 and the number dropped
was 80*690. The first payments on pen*
sions allowed during tne year amounted
to $83*576,549.98. This includes arrears or
accumulation between the :fimo from
which tho allowance of pension dates and
the time of actually granting the certifi
cate. Although the law of 1S90 permits
pensions for disabilities related to mili
tary service, yet as a requisite to its ben
efit a disability must exist incapacitating
tlie applicant from the perform
ance of manual labor to such a degree as
to render him unable to earn a support
The execution of this law in ts early
stages does not seem to have been in ac
cord with its true intention, but toward
the close of the last administration an au
thoritative constrnction was given to the
statute and since that time this construc*
tiou has been followed. This has had the
effect of limiting the operation of the law
to its intended purpose.
Pension Frauds.
The discovery having been made that
mauy names had been put upon the pen
sion roll bv means of wholesale and gigan
tic frauds* the commissioner suspended
payments upon a number of pensions which
seem to be fraudulent or unauthorized
pending a compieto examination, giving
notice to the pensioners, In order that
they might have an opportunity to estab
lish ff possible the justice of tneir claims
notwithstanding apparent invalidity.
This understand is the practice which
has for a long time prevailed in the pen
sion bureau. Gut after -entering upon
these investigations the commissioner
modified this rule so as not to allow until
after complete examination interference
with the payment of a pension anparentl}'
not altogether void, but which merely had
been fixed at a rate higher than that au
thorized by law. I am unable to under
stand why frauds iu the pension rolls
should not be exposed aud corrected with
thoroughness and vigor. Every name
fraudulently put upon these rolls is a
wicked Imposition upon the kind
ly ntiment in which pen
sions have tlieir origin. Every
fraudulent pensioner has become a bad
citizen every false oath in support of a
pension has made perjury more common,
arid false and undeserving pensioners rob
the people not only of their money, bat
of the patriotic sentiment which the snr*
vivors of the war who fought for the
preservation of the union ought to in
spire. Thousands of neighborhoods have
their well known fraudulent pensioners
and recent developments by the bureau
establish appalling conspiracies to ac
complish pension frauds. By no means
the least wrong done is to the brave and
deserving pensioners, who certainly ought
not to be condemned to such association.
Those who attempt iu the line of duty to
rectify these wrongs should not be ac
cused of enmity or indiffereuec to tho
claims of honest veterans.
Tlie sum expended on account of pen
sions for the y.ear ending June 30, 189J,
was $156,740,467.14. The commissioner es
timates that $165,000,000 will be required
to pay pensions during the year ending
Jutic 80, 1894.
The Public Lands.
Tho vast area of land which but a short
time ago constituted the public domain is
rapidly falling into private hands. It is
certain that in the transfer the beneficent
intention of tho government to supply
from Its domains homes to the industrious
and worthy homeseekers is often frus
trated through the speculator who stunds
with extortionate purpose between the
land office and those who with their fam
ilies are invited by tho government to set
tle on the public lands. He is a despica
ble character who ought not to be toler
ated, yet it is difficult to thwart his
schemes. The recent opening to
settlement of the lauds in the
Cherokee outlet, embracing an area of
6,500,10.) acres, notwithstanding the ut
most care in framing regulations govern
ing the selection of locations and notwith
standing the presence of United Slates
troops, furnished on exhibition, though
perhaps in a modified degree, of the mad
scramble the violeuce and the fraudulent
occupation which have accompanied pre
vious openings of public lands. I concur
with the secretary in the belief that these
outrageous incidents cannot be entirely
prevented without a change in the laws
on the subject, and I hope his recom
mendations in that direction will be favor
ably considered.
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
Morton Is Lopping Off Ue!?ss Office Help
-The Sesd Nuisance.
The report of tho secretary of agri
culture will be found exceedingly inter
esting, especially to that large part of our
citizens intimately concerned in agricul
tural occupations. On the 7th day of
March, 1S93, there were upon its pay rolls
2,430 employes. This number has been
reduced to 1,850 persons. In view
of a depleted nublic treasurv
and the imperative demand of
people for economy in the administration
of their government, the secretary has en
tered upon^ho task of rationally reducing
expeditures by the elimination" from the
pay roll of all persons not needed for an
cfiicient conduct of the affairs of the de
partment. During the first quarter of
the present year the expenses of the de
partment aggregated $845,976.76, us
against $102,021.42 for tho corresponding
period of the fiscal year endlug June 30,
1891. Tlie secretary makes apparent his
intention to continue this rate of reduc
tion by submitting estimates for the next
fiscal year less by $991,280 than those of
the present year.
Expansive Seerf.
In tho year 1839 congress appropriated
$1,000. to be taken from the patent ofiice
funds, for tho purpose of collecting and
distributing rare and improved varie
ties of seeds and for prosecuting
agricultural investigations and procuring
agricultural statistics. From this small
beginning the seed division of the depart
ment of agriculture has growu to its pres
ent unwieldy and unjustifiably extrava
gant proportions. During the last fiscal
year tho cost of seeds purchased was $ 6,
48.«l. The remainder of an appropria
tion of $135,0 0 was expended in pulling
them up and distributing them. It surely
never could have entered tho minds of
those who first sanctioned appropriations
of public money for the purchase of new
and improved varieties of seeds for grat
uitous distribution that from this would
grow large appropriations for the pur
chase and distribution by members of
cougress of ordinary seeds, bulbs and cut
tings which are common in all the states
and territories and everywhere easily
obtainable at low prices. In each state
and territory an agricultural experiment
station has been established. These sta
tions, by their very character and name,
are tho proper agencies to experiment
with and test new varieties of seeds, and
yet this indiscriminate and wasteful dis
tribution by legislation and legislators
continues, answering no purpose nuloss it
be to remind constituents that tlieir rep
resentatives are willing to re
member them at public cost.
Under the sanction of existing legislation
thero was sent out from the agricultural
department during the last fiscal year
enough cabbage seed to plant 19,200 acres
of land, a sufficient quantity of beans to
plant 4,000 acres, beet seed enough to
plant 2,50J acres, sweet oorn enough to
plant 7,80.) acres, sufficient cucumber seed
to cover 2,0 5 acres, with vines and
cuough muskmelon and other melou seeds
to plant 2.67.i aci'es. The total quantity of
flower and vegetable seeds thus distribu
ted was contaiued In more than O.OJO.OOO
packages and they wero sufficient if
planted to cover 89,596 acres of land.
In view of these facts this enormous ex
penditure without legitimate returns or
benefit ought'to be abolished. Anticipat
ing a consummation so manifestly in tho
intcrcrtts of good administration, more
$100,000 has been stricken from tho
estimate made to cover this object for the
year ending June 80, 1894, and the secre
tary recommends that tho remaining
$1,500 of the estimate be coufined strictly
to the purchase of new and improved va
rieties of seeds, and that these be distrib
uted through experiment stations. This
seed will be tested and after the test has
been completed by the experiment station
the propagation of the useful varieties
and the rejection,.,of the valueless may
safely b$.left to the common..apnsc of the
people.
CIVIL SERVICE LAW.
President Clevaland Pleased With Its Very
Marked Succass.
The continued intelligent execution of
the civil service .Jaw. unit the iMCreasic*
approval by the people of its operation
are most gratifying. The recent exten*
slon of its limitat-ons and regulations to
the employes at free delivery postoffices
which ha«i been huncstly aud promptly
accomplished by the commission with the
hearty co-operatiou of the postmaster
general is an immensely important ad
vance in the usefulness of the system. I
am if possible more than ever convinced
of the incalculable benefits conferred by
the civil service law not only in its effects
upon the public service, but also what is
even more important in its effect in elo
vating the tone of political life generally.
Tho course of civil service reform in this
couutry instructively and interestingly
illustrates how strong a hold a movement
gains upon our people which has under
lying it a sentiment of justice and right
and which at the &ame time promises bet
ter administration of their government.
TARIFF REFORM AT HAND.
The
Nothing should intervene to distract
our attention or disturb our effort until
this reform is accomplished by wise and
careful legislation.
While wo should staunchly adhere tc?
tho principle that only the necessity of
revenue Justifies Uie imposition of tariff
duties and other federal taxation and
that they should bo limited by strict
economy, we cannot close, our eyes to the
fact that conditions have grown up among
us which, in justice and fairness, call for
discriminating care in the distribution of
such duties and taxation as the emergen
cies of our government actually demand.
Mnnifestly, if we arc to aid tho people
directly through tariff reform, one of Its
most obvious features should be a reduc
tion in the present tariff charges upon tho
necessaries of life. The benefits of such
a reduction would be palnableand sub
stantial. and seen and felt oy thousands,
who would be better fed and better
clot lied and better sheltered. These gifts
should be the willing bcuefactions of a
government whose highest function is the
promotion of the welfare of, the people.
Not less closely related to our people's
prosperity and well being Is the removal
of restrictions upou tho importation of
the raw material necessary to our manu
facturers. The world should be open
to our national ingenuity and enterprise.
This cannot be while federal legislation
through the imposition of a high tariff
forbids to American manufacturers as
cheap raw materials as those used by their
competitor*. It is quite obvious that the
enhancement of the price of our manu
factured products resulting from this
policy not only confines the market for
these products within our own borders, to
the direct disadvantage of our manufact
urers, but also increases their cost to our
citizens. The interests of labor are cer
tainly though iudireetly involved in this
feature of our tariff system. The
sharp competition and active
strugg among our manufactu
rers to supply the limited demand
for their goods soon fill the narrow mar
ket to which they are confined. Then fol
lows suspension of work in mills and fac
tories, a discharge of employes and dis
tress in the homes of our working men.
Evvu if tho often disproved assertion
could be made good, that a lower rate of
wnges would result from free raw mate
rials and low tariff duties, the intelligence
of our working men leads them quickly to
discover that their steady employment, if
ermitted by free raw "materials, is the
importautifactor in their relation to tariff
legislation.
Tho Wibcn Bi!1.
A measure has been prepared by the
appropriate congressional committee, cm
bodying tariff reform on the lines herein
suggested, which will be promptly sub
mitted for legislative action. It is the re
sult of much patriotic and unselfish work,
and I believe it deals with the subject as
consistently and thoroughly as existing
conditions permit. I am satisfied that tho
reduced tariff duties provided for in the
proposed legislation, added to existing in
ternal revenue taxation, will, within the
near future, though perhaps not immcdi
ately* produce sufficient revenue to
meet tho needs of tho government.
The committee after full consideration,
and to provide agaiust a temporary defi
ciency which inay exist before the busi
ness of the country adjusts itself to the
new tariff schedules, have wisely em
braced in their plan a few additional in
ternal revenue taxes, including a small
tax upon incomes derived from ce tain
corporations. These new taxes are not
only absolutely just and the easiest borne,
but they have the further virtue of being
of such kind as can be remitted without
unfavorable business disturbances .when
ever the necassity of their imposition no
longer exists.
In my great desire for tho success of
this measure, I cannot restrain the sug
gestion that its success can only be at
tained by means of unselfish counsel on
the part of th'e friends of tariff reform,
and as a result of their willingness,
subordinate state interests to the general
good. The local interests affected by the
proposed reform are so numerous and so
varied that if all are insisted upon, the
legislation embodying the reform must
inevitably fail.
In conclusion, my intense feeling of re
sponsibility impels me. to invoke for tho
manifold interests of a grcnerous and con
fiding people the most scrupulous care
and to pledge my willing support to
every legislative effort for the advance
ment of the greatness and prosperity of
our beloved country.
'V'
People
President Insists Thit the
Want Fraar Trade.
After a hard struggle tariff reform is
directly before us. Nothing so Important
claims our attention and nothing so
clearly presents itself as both an opportu
nity and a duty, an opportunity to deserve
the gratitude of our fello*w citizens, a
duty imposed upon us by our oft repeated
professions and by the emphatic mandate
of tho people After full discussion our
countrymen'have spoken in favor of this
reform aud they have confided the work
of its acco.mplishmcnt to tho hutids of
those who are solemnly pledged to It. If
there Is anything in the theory
of representation in public places
of the people and their desires,
if political ofiicers are really
the servants of the people and if political
promises and professions have any bind
ing force, our failure to give the relief so
long awaited will be sheer receancy.

Judge Edgerton Gives the Gist ol
the Decision.
Huron Merchants HaYs a Schema to Gei
Ahead of Grasping Fire Insurance
Companies An Interesting
OH Flint'ock,
Sioux FALLS, S. D., Dec. 7.—An Abcr
3eeu dispatch says that the dispatches
icnt out from Sioux Falls with refer
ence to the recent bond decision of
'udgo Edgerton misstates the purport
the decision. Judgo Edgerton wa»
lhnself as Iced by your correspondent
give the gist of the decision which
being discussed all over the stat«
vith great vigor and in some cases with
(Teat acrimony. The judge said: "Th«
tourt decided that the recital in the
jonds of a legal conclusion does not
tstop the defendant from showing
he fact. The recital of a
'act does constitute an estop
?cl. Had the bonds recited that the
,ax contemplated by the constitution
lad been levied even if the tax had not
een levied, the defendant would have
^een estopped from pleading that the
ax had not been levied. But in the
pinion of the court a general recital
•o tho ert'ect that all the neces
sary legal antecedent conditions had
Deeu fulfilled—which is a legal con
clusion—does not estop from showing
.he fact that the tax demanded by thij
:onstitution to be levied had not been
cvied."
As a matter of fact so far as can be
yarned none of tho bonds issued by
my city council or school board since
5outh Dakota became a state recite
hat such a tax had been levied, as in
ieed it has not been in any case, as tho
luthorities issuing the bonds have
thought that they could not levy such a
ax until given authority by the legis
ature. Tho court decides that tho
failure to specifically recite that the tax
question has been levied renders tho
jonds invalid. All these bonds
ail to make such recitals, and
icnce are declared under this decision
.o be void. In this city there are32()0,
)00 worth of bonds which have been is
med since statehood and the recitals in
vliich so far as this point is concerned
ire the same as in tho Huron bonds.
ne Black Hills town has $200,000 of
uch bonds and it is said is only wait
ng for the present case to be sustained
oy tho court of appeals to bring an ac
tion to repudiate the bonds. This i*
dated not as a fact, but
is a well grounded rumoi
ifloat hero. A well knows
nan here estimates that there are ovei
U,00j,000 worth of bouds which, undet
his decision, can be repudiated. There
uo reason for believing that many
ittempts to repudiate will be made but
helioUlcrsofthese bonds are said tc
very nervous over the decision. One
if the attorneys in the case says that
his opinion it will be impossible tc
ell $t worth of bonds from South l)a
sotu until this decision is reversed.
A New Insurance Schema.
HURON*, S. D., Dec. 7.—A new organi
tation for insurance is being intro
(uced in this city. It is known as the
Merchants Indemnity association and
vi 11 be managed and controlled en
•irely by merchants, and will offer in-:
lemnity for loss by fire on mercantile
ttock only and is purely a mutual pro*
.ection for this class. In every town
laving five or more merchants, then)
/vill be organized an advisory board
ifter which no person wi.l bo admitted
nto membership without the consenl
of the members of this board. Certifi
cates of membership will be issued,
which certificate will state tho
full obligations of its members while
good standing and entitles the
aolder to all tho benefits arising there'
from. Merchants are enthusiastic ii)
•heir praise of the plan and prospect!
ire good for the establishment of ad
risory baards in all the principal
towns of the state by the 1st of next
month. The new organization is the
utgrowth of the recent advance of 20
aer cent in rates by insurance com
panies. It is said the new association
ffers protection at a rate not exceed
ng 20 per ceut of the present rato of
'nsu ranee.
An Old Flintlock.
CIIAMUKRLAI.N, S. I)., Dee. 7.—.ludge
Burns of Spearflsh has in his possession
:he remains of an old fashioned flint
(oclc, smooth bore musket that is sup
posed to have quite a history. It was
found about a month ago on tho banks
•jf Spearflsh creek on a ranch north of
iho town of Spearflsh. It was evidently
taken into the Hills in early dajrs, prob
ably the beginning of this century, and
il- does not require a very great stretch
af imagination to connect it with a
party of adventurous prospectors who
went to the Hills in 1833, and who wero
surprised and killed by the Indians.
The last man of the party wrote a his
tory of their adventures and left It
near the base of Lookout mountain,
where it was found a few years ago
by a man numed Lewis Thone, in
whose possession it now is. The brief
history was written on apiece of sand
stone and placed where the action of
the elements would not destroy it, and
it is perfectly plain and legible
today. In the history the
writer mentions the fact that he
had lost his musket. The musket in
possession df Judge Burns is undoubt
edly of very ancient origin. Its stock
Was made of elm, but is now badly de
composed, though still fastened to the
barrel of the gun. The lock is entirely
gone, but the construction of the pow
der pan on the side of the barrel proves
conclusively that it was of tho flint
lock pattern. As the historian of the
party of prospectors above alluded to
mentioned that his musket had
been lost, it is reasonably
supposed that this is the
identical firearm which he mentions in
the history written on the sandstone.
It was found within five or six miles of
the spot where the sandstone was
found, and it coincides in every partie
ular with the guns in use at that time.
It is certainly an interesting relic, and
could it speak would tell an interesting
story of the adventures of the daring
party of prospectors who fought theli
way through thousands of Indians to
look for gold tn the Black Hills.
Destructive Fire.
NORFOLK, Va., Dec. 6.—Fire was dfo
covered in building No. 15, containing
steam engineering aud general stores,
it the navy yard at 7:30 o'clock thii
morning. The origin of the fire is un
known, but it is thought to haw
been due to a defective flue.
It started on the second floor whore a
lot of waste was stored. The building
was 75x250 feet and tWo stories high.
It was entirely destroyed with its con
tents. It is impossible to state the
loss, but it will probably reaefe $250,«
000.

CHICAGO, Dee. 5.—Juror Taylor was
excused from the Cronin panel by
ludge Futhill this morning. This ac

said in excusing Taylor that his disJ

juror in any way. Less than
half an hour was required to
obtain the twelfth juror, who was the
second talisman examined. The last
man is Hiram M. YVadleigh, a marine
engineer, who was living in Iowa at
the time of the Cronin murder. The
jury was then sworn in by the clerk.
When the jurors had retired from
the coui*t room ex-Judge Wing
Informed the court that counsel for the
stato had intimated to him that Mrs.
Andrew Foy would be a witness foi
the prosecution, and if itBhould appeal
that she is not a proper person to testify
against the defendant, he would mov*
that the court instruct the prosecutioD
to eliminate from the opening addrcsd
to the jury all mention ol
Mrs. Foy and the evidence
which she was expected to
give. This was tlid real opening of th«
trial and the importance of Mrs. Foy'i
evidence in the estimation of the de
fense was demonstrated by the long
argument of Attorney Wing and tha
cases he cited to keep her new story
from the jury.
