KICI.ATIO.VS WITH JAPAN
Samuel (iompers, president of the
American Federation of I^-ibor, address
ing the meeting of the council yester
day afternoon, expressed the hope, that
; members of the council's commission
[ on relations with Japan will succeed in
| bringing about an amicable adjustment
! of labor differences in the Pacific Coast
States. Dr. Sidney 1* Guiick, of Dosh
Isha University, Japan, a well-known
authority on the Japanese situation and
1 head of the council's commission on re
lations with Japan, is now working
with labor Naders on the I'acillc Coast
ii; an effort to bring about conciliatory
action on the part of organized labor
in that locality on the one hand, and
tiie Japanese on the other.
"Within the past month," said Mr. J
(.iompers In his speech, "I have been
several times In conference with Dr.
(iullck with regard to the situation on
ti)o Pacific Coast. As a result of these
conferences, l)r. Macfarland and Dr.
GuIlCk havo not only comu to Phila
delphia.^ .attend the annual convention
of the ApH'fMean Federation of I^abOr,
but Dr. Gulick has mat a number of
the most Influential labor leaders from
the-Pacillc>Coast States, and they have
gone, over together the matter of try
ing to find some adjustment of the
conflicting Interests of the world ngmen ,
and the Japanese of California.
"We certainly welcome the aid of the
Federal Council In our task of light
ening th>- burdens of the working peo
ple of tills land."
THOUSANDS ()F DIMKiltAVI'S
PHKSK.VT SKHUH S IHtOIII,KH |
Mr. Gompers made the point that the .
thousands of foreign laborers that are j
constantly pouring into America from j
all sides present many perplexing prob- |
lems. lie said that in many instances '
hundreds of foreigners are induced to j
come to America by great business en- !
t? rprises, whose sole idea is financial j
gain. "We must work with the ma- !
ferial we have at hand," said Mr. j
Gompers, "and strive to show to these i
workmen their duties and obligations, I
thereby making better, men of them. I
We must strive to protect the weak I
against the oppression of the strong, I
and to make to-day better and bright
er than yesterday and to-morrow bet
ter than to-day. We are governed by
no 'isms' or 'creeds:' we have the hard,
concrete problem of life with which to
oeai. and we must devote all of our
efforts to the solution of the problem."
Dr. Gulick and President Shaller
Mathews wore named by tlie executive
committee of the council as n special
deputation to continue an Investiga
tion of the labor-Japanese problem In
the Pacific Coast States, and later to
go to Japan to convey to the people
of that country a message from Chris
tian Americans, to be drafted by a
committee of nine members of the
council, appointed yesterday. with
Bishop E. It. Ilendrix, of the Metho
dist Episcopal Church, St. I?ouls, Mo.,

Final action In the matter wns takr-n
in the soshIoii lust night when the
council passed n resolution authorizing
the appointment of Dr. Gullck and Dr.
Mathews as a special deputation to the
Japanese peopl" hearing a message
from the Koderal Council of the
Churches of Christ in America as rep
resenting the sentiment of the Chris
tian people of this country.
Dr. dullclc, who was to have deliv
erer! an address before the council
last night, left early yesterday for
Washington, accompanied by Or.
Mathows. At the session last night
l)r. Mathews said: "I have Just come

Hocretary 11 r.van and the Japanese am
bassador. All three showed the great
est Interest and approval In our pro

been a. discussion among us as to
whether the present time is opportune
for this visit on account of the Kuro

"Wo Anally caine to the conclusion
that this was Just the time to carry

Dr. Gullck, of Doshlslin University,

this city $1," declared Vice-President
.and General Counsel Henry W. Ander
son. of that company, addressing a
mflss-meetlng of Kast End citizens on
the franchise application at the Chlm- j
borazo Public School last night. "I ?
will give you a written _ communica
tion to that effect if you want It.
"It appears that the Company's po
sition has been entirely misunderstood.
The ordinance of the city required It
In submitting a petition for a new
[ franchise to accompany such petition
with at least a tentative draft of the
franchise ordinance that is desired. Wo
would have preferred to submit no or

"The company has no desire to run

want to keep in step with public sen

that will be accomplished only by get

Mr. Anderson spoke for forty min
uter, heading a quartet of speakers
on the franchise application. It was
the first public expression of the Vir
ginia Hallway and Power Company
hi a ring directly upon its pending ap
plication to vthe Council, and it was
delivered, to all appearances, in the
enemy's country.
After Mr. Anderson, spoke Attorney
Louis O. Wendenburg. who denounced
the Virginia Hallway and Power Com
pany's petition and suggested fran
chise as a "bold and outrageous propo
sition" fraught with danger to citizens
present and yet unborn. Following
him came .1 oseph W. Stewart, a mem
ber of the board of directors of the
Church Hill Bank, who announced his
intention to fight the company's appli
cation to the bitter end, unless it were
modified to lit the wishes of Church
Hill. Next came James Dickers.-??,
prominent in Church JIlll politics, who
denounced the company's proposition
in language still a shade more vig

Mr. Dlckerson, the last speaker on
the program, wound up his address
with a spirited appeal to the assem
blage to adopt unanimously the reso
lutions submitted to the mass-meeting
at the beginning of the evening. In
an amplified form, the resolutions re
peated the demands enumerated in the
resolutions adopted recently by the
three ISast-Knd organizations, under
whose joint auspices last night's meet
ing was held.
K. II. Wakefield, of the Kast-Knd
Progressive Association, presiding over
the mass-meeting, read a brief state
ment to the effect that, tne meeting
had now heard argument pro and con,

DAY CLASSES ARK NEEDED
Evening Schools and Part-Time In
dustrial Classes Strongly
Recommended.
At the meeting of the purvey com
mittee of tho National Society for the
Promotion of Industrial Education
yesterday afternoon it was recom
mended that the Virginia Mechanics'
Institute be merged with the public
school system of Richmond, In accord
ance with the following plan:
"That the corporate name of the Vir
ginia Mechanics' Institute shall be pre
served, but that the ownership of its
property shall be vested in the city
of Richmond.
"That an ordinance be passed by the
City Council of Richmond which shall
provide that the immediate direction
of the affairs of the Mechanics' Insti
tute shall be under an advisory board
of five members, one member from each
city school district, and two members
at large: and that the management
of the Institute shall be under the gen
eral direction of the City School
Hoard, to be used for public school
purposes In connection with- both the
day and evening rchool work.
"That the City School Hoard of
Richmond shall agree to make this
plant the vocational centre of the pub
I lie school system and open the Instl
i tute In the daytime as soon as prac
| tlca! after this merger shull have been
I accomplished.
I "In the event that this merger can
he brought about In accordance with
the above plan, it will be possible to
make the Virginia Mechanics' Institute
serve the public school system of the
entire city for both day and night
classes for practically the whole year,
and the institute would be eligible, as
an Institution supported ami controlled
by the public, to participate In the dis
tribution of the funds which will be
available in the event of tho granting
of Slate moneys for industrial or com
mercial education to the local commu
nities of Virginia, or in the event of
the passage of the industrial education
bill now pending before the Congress
of the United States."
WANTS EVEMJVCi SCHOOLS
OF IXDUSTK1AI, OlIDI'lt
It was recommended that* schools
and courses for beys and mer. already
employed should find expression In i wo I
great groups: (1) evening schools of i
industrial order and of general order; i
(2) part-time schools, of like orders, j
and that schools of the industrial '
order should take most decidedly the
trade extension aspect. It was also
recommended that steps be taken at
once by tho Richmond school authori
ties to establish part-time day schools
or classes for those industries and
plants where employers have expressed
a willingness to co-operate In this
way.
There is need, the report says, for
evening classes in salesmanship, and
need for department store and sales
manship training, through pnrt-time
and continuation classes. A practical
arts course of more advanced and spe
cialized character should he offered in
the regular high school for girls who
have graduated from the elementary
school or the Junior high school, and
entered the high school' for more gen
eral training, and it Is recommended
that there be established schools or
classes in prevocational work for girls,
covering the period corresponding to
the last two years of the elementary
school. An outline of the studies to
be taught Is given In the report. A |
separate department Is to be given to |
the practical arts, the t report stating
that opportunities are opening up in
Richmond for numerous wage-earning
and salaried callings, which are based
upon a very practical, as well as sclen
tltic, knowledge of home economics.
MCKI) I'"Oil IMHT TIME
CHI COXTIN I'ATIOX CI,ASSES
Because of the great need of further
training for the large army of girls
under sixteen years of age who become
wage-earners before completing the
elementary schools, the school authori
ties. the report says, should make a
special effort to induce employers ?t?
co-operate voluntarily by giving their j
young workers time to attend a part- !
time or continuation school or class for j
at least four hours a week.
The. survey shows that there is a de- '
mand in Richmond for provocation^ j
training for children more than tliir- j
teen years of age and no demand at |
present for any type of all-day Indus- |
trial or trade school; and the commit- |
tee recommends, there/ore, that the
Richmond schools develop as rapidly as
possible schools or classes in prevoca
tional training, admitting hoys who
havs completed the work of the 5B
grade and who look forward to leav
ing school at a relatively early age in
order to go to work, and who need the
help of the school in reaching a deci
sion as to what line of work they may
enter with the greatest prospect of suc
cess. Prevocational training, the re
port says, should provide vocational di
rection and guidance for children who
arc likely to face the complexities of
modern Industrial and commercial life.
It must give them an experience'and a
knowledge which will servo as a basis
upon which an intelligent choice of a
life career may be made.
MKTS FIVE AIMS TO
I1E ACCOMPLISHED
The committee recommends the fol
lowing five aims to be accomplished:
"To encourage local communities to
give vocational education a now and
needed kind of training, benetlclal and
desirable In the Interest of the State
as a whole.
."To aid local'communltlcs with their
varying resources to provide effective
vocational training.
"To secure for the State the right to
a reasonable participation or voice In
the development of vocational educa
tion In the State.

i
Thinks Sentiment of People Opposes
Turning Country Into Great

ALL DAY BEI<X)RE COMMITTEE
Question of Military Preparedness
Dominant Subject of Attention in J
Congress, and Discussion Seems to
Threaten Long, General Debate.
WASHINGTON, December 10.?Mili
tary preparedness of the nation was
again the dominant subject of congres
sional attention to-day. Secretary
Daniels, before the Mouse Naval Com
i mlttee. defended his two battleships a
year construction program, and de
clared the sentiment of the people of
the United States opposed turning the
country Into a great military power. |
Meantime, a free-for-all national de
fense debate occupied the House Itself.
Mr. Daniels, during an all-day exami
nation, said this country already had
a powerful navy, and that while "with
abundant revenues," he might favor
the general board's four-battleship
plan, he thought the two-battleship
program adequate. Pressed for an
opinion as to the world military situa
tion at the Close of the European war,
the secretary predicted an tnterhatlonal
conference on armament.
"When the war Is over," ho said,
"these countries will be so exhausted
in their resources and burdened with
debt that there will be a great revul
sion against war. I expect the revul
sion will bo so great that we will have i
an international conference on arma
ment?more possible now than before? I
than ever before, and that we will get i
some action by which the nrtvles of
the world powers will be used only to,
carry Into execution tho agreements
the countries reach."
GAIl D.MOIt 1MIECI 1'ITATHS
DISCUSSION IN 1I01JSU I
Representative Gardner precipitated !
tho military discussion on the House i
floor with a speech, criticizing the ad- i
ministration for "laying the cold hand J
of death" on his proposal for special !
Investigation of military and naval j
conditions. He assailed the Kules [
Committee for refusal to grand him ai
hearing, and the Naval and Military 1
Committees for failure to summon be- J
fore them former Cabinet ofllclals and i
other witnesses he wanted examined.
"If war were to break out to-day,"
said Mr. Gardner, "It would be found
our coast defenses havo not sufllclcnt
ammunition for an hour's lighting."
Representative Fitzgerald, of New
York, replied briefly, and promised to
! make a complete reply later, which
I would make "notoriety-seeking ex
I secretaries" less anxious to discuss the
national defense.
j Representative Dies, of Texas, ridi
| cult d the thought of Impending dan
ger of attack Representative S|sson,
of Mississippi, charged "the war propa
ganda" to the manufacturers of war
material. Representative Prouty, of
Iowa, " pleaded for international dis
armament, arbitration and an Interna
tional police, and declared a force of
trained squirrel shooters could pre
vent the landing of a hostile force on
American soil.
To-day's discussion seemed to
threaten a prolonged general debate
on both sides of the Capitol. In tho
Senate to-morrow the military sltun
! tlon will be discussed by Senator
Weeks, of Massachusetts. Secretary
Daniels will continue his statoment be

Admitted.
LONDON. December 10 (10:07 P. M.).
?While the defeat of tho German
squadron in the South Atlantic has
evoked pro.it satisfaction throughout
| Great Britain, thcro have been no cele
| bratlons such as marked tho victories
' of the South African War. tho British
people being too much wrapped up In
operations of the allied armies on the
Continent.
The lack of news from Poland causes
uneasiness regarding the outcome of
the prolonged battle between the Rus
sians and Germans, but reports from
Frunce are considered here most fa- I
vorable to the allies.
The daily communication from Paris |
shows that the French have been mak- j
lug slow progress at many points for!
a fortnight, and a review sent by a
French eyewitness for tho period fr.om I
November 27 to December 5 claims that
the ascendancy of tho French Infantry |
and artillery over the Germans has ]
been established.
Tho French headquarters report to- j
night ndds little to the general knowl- ]
. edge, as it says the situation la un
changed,, which Indicates, however, that |
the positions taken have heen main- |
tallied. Berlin states that the French
attacks in the Argonne havo been re
pulsed.
A 5.1,1 ICS PUSH FORWARD
IN NUMBER OF I'IjACKS
It Is apparent, however, that with the j
withdrawal of German troops to |
strengthen the armies in the cast, tho
allies have pushed their lines forward!
In many places.
The Germans continue their efforts
to smash the Russian armies. While
a large part of their force Is endeav
oring to hold the Russian centre, an
other army la advancing from Kast i
Prussia to the east of Mlawa and Is
attacking the Russian right in an ef- j
fort to cut communications and enter !
Warsaw through the back door.
Heavy lighting is going on southwest |
of Lodz and southeast of Cracow,
where the. Austrians and Germans are j
endeavoring to get around the Rus
sian left and foreo the troops to re- i
tire.
The Germans are repeating on a !
large scale their favorite tactics of'
outflanking th?i opposing forces. In j
this they always have gained initial |
successos. because of their ability, with i
hotter means, to move their troops'
quickly. The Russians, however, here
tofore, have met them with overwhelm
ing numbers.
The defeat of the Austrians by tho
Servians Is virtually admitted In the
Austrian ofllclal report, which says that
because they have met strong hostile
forces Austrian troops have been or
dered to occupy more favorable posi
tions.
SERVIANS IXPIilCT 8KVKUK
DKFKAT ON INVADERS
This sudden turn of events In favor
[ of the Servians is a mystery, but it Is
possible they havo received reinforce
ments from Russia or more guns and
ammunition from some friendly coun-j
try, . or It may be th.it some of 'the
Austrian troops wore withdrawn from |
Servla after tho occupation of Bel-;
?rade. Whatever the cause, the Ser
vians hrtve inflicted a severe defeat on
tho invaders.
I>atest official reports? from Berlin

under control before the fact of his
Illness was made public, and that he
probably will make a quick recovery.

LONDON. December 10 (8:50 P. M.).?
The German cruiser Nurnborg. which
withdrew from the battlo off the Falk
land Inlands last Tuesday and attempt
ed to escape. In company wit": the
cruiser Dresden, while the British war
ships, under Vice-Admiral Sir Fred
erick Dovnton Sturdoe, were sinking
tho cruisers iScharnhorst, Gnelsenau
and Leipzig, was hunted across tho
water by'units of the British fleet and
sunk the same day.
Tho Information was contained in a
statement of tho British official press
bureau made public to-day. The state
ment added that search for the Dres
den was still proceeding.
Although the official press bureau
says tho British mcn-o'-war aro still
socking for tho last one of Admiral
von Speo's vessels, unofficial reports re
ceived In Buenos Aires say the Dres
den has been cornered in the tortuous
Straits of Magellan. Whether theso
reports aro true or not. It is holleved
in admiralty circles here that tho Dres
den, even though she Is a somewhat
faster lioat than any of those sunk In
Tuesday's battle, eventually will be
brought Into action.
Tho battlo In which the SChamhorst,
Gnelsenau and Leipzig were sent to tho
bottom, according to an admiralty re
port. lasted five hours with Intervals.
Tho Scharnhorst sank in threo hours
and tho linoisonau two hours later. No
los.< of any British vessel has been
reported by tho admiralty.
IMMEDIATE EFFECT
OX INSURANCE HATES
The destruction of a majority of tho
ships of the German squadron had ?n
Immediate cftect on insurance rates,
and tho government rate for Insurance
of cargoes against war risk was re
duced immediately from two guineas
to one and ono-half guineas per cent.
Ono member' of Lloyd's, who recently
has not been accepting any business,
resumed operations.
The Impression prevails among naval
men that Admiral' von Spee, realizing
that he could no longer keep out of
touch with the British nnd Japanese
fleets patrolling the Pacific, decided to
enter tho Atlantic and make n run for
home, hoping that at least some of his
ships would got past the British. This
move, It Is aaid, wns anticipated by lb*
admiralty, and Vlco-Admlral Sturileo
was sent south to head off tho Ger
mans before they could get well Into
tho Atlantic and scatter, which Would
