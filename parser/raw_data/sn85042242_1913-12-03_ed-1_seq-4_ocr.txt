President Wilson's First Message
President Wilson ha» delivered Ills address to the,
congress of the United States, and it is reproduced
in this issue of the Tribune.
The world has waited anxiously for this message,
and, now that it has been delivered, it is a 'question
if it will'not prove a bit disappointing, in that it lacks
scope and positiveness. His remarks on the Mexican
question throw no new light upon the situation he
favors rural credits in no positive way favors presi­
dential nomination by primary touches on the han­
dling of acquired foreign possessions favors govern­
ment railroad building in Alaska and promises to
take up the question of dealing with the Sherman
anti-trust act by special message later. He favors
universal peace, recommends more legislation for
safety at sea and in mines.
There is a lack of positiveness in the entire mes­
sage, and much is "hoped." Whether this is the
smooth hand of a diplomat or the evasive plan of a
politician remains to be seen. It is so unlike the
messages of Cleveland, McKinley and Roosevelt, or
even that of Taft, that it ranks as exceptional.
Threats to demolish oil tanks and create devasta­
tion by firing the contents go a step beyond the em­
ployment of oil as battleship fuel, but introduce it to
notice ns a substitute for arms and ammunition.
Is Bloom Fool or Knave?
The Devils Lake Journal, in its issue of the 22nd
inst., under a Bismarck date line publishes an article
on its front page headed, "Business Administration,"
^which, for false conclusions from incorrect premises,
self-adulation and sublime impudence, easily takes
first place among the many similar but less complete
ferns, ~which, -from time to time, are given forth, by
the doughty colonel whose name "blooms" peren
ially from the top of the Journal's editorial page.
Alas, that it could not have been produced prior to
the late "successful" meeting of the Ananias club,
there to be perpetuated in letters of gold and treas­
ured as one of the most representative possessions
of that peculiar body.
The article in question is evidently intended as
a boost for the state tax commission and a knock
for the present state administration. That it en­
deavors to accomplish this result by misrepresenta­
tion and falsehood is merely an incident, eminently
in keeping with the traditions of Democratic journal­
ism in North Dakota and especially of that part of
such Journalism as breaks out intermittently from
that dean of falsifiers—Bloom of Devils Lake.
Probably the most impudent juggling of figures
and unfair imputing of motives is that portion of the
article in question which deals with the alleged de­
crease in valuation of street railway properties.
Here an error in the mileage of Grand Forks for
1912 is made the basis of an insinuation that the re­
sulting smaller valuation in 1913 (when the error was
corrected) was accomplished because "Governor Han
na and his friends own the street railways," to quote
the slander verbatim.
The facts are these—facts which anyone animated
by a spirit of fair play could well have ascertained
'by the application of the same diligence in arriving
at the truth as has been exerted in manufacturing
and circulating a cowardly inuendo: In 1912, by
some means still unexplained, the mileage of street
railways in Grand Forks, while correctly given by
the company at 6.50 miles, was extended as being
6 97 miles. The total assessed valuation for the state
In 1912—which, of course, included this error—thus
reached the sum of $62,570. In 1913 the mileage was
correctly stated and was so extended, and the state
total shows $61,160. The Grand Forks mileage error
amounted to exactly $1,410. Now, if Chief Liar Bloom
and his little echoes at the state capitol will take
out their little pencils and set their little bunches of
gray matter to work on a little sum of simple addi­
tion they will find that $1,410 added to $61,160 makes
just exactly the sum of $62,570. They can then
reverse the sum and subtract from $62,570 the sum
Of $1,410, and they will find that the result is $61,169.
This reverse action is suggested merely to protect
the gentlemen from their own innate disposition to
misrepresent and is what little children in the first
grade call "proving" the sum.
So it will appear, in effect, that there was no
change at all made in the assessed valuation of street
railways in 1913—the thunder of the Devils Lake lie
factory falls flat—and Bloom, et al., stand convicted
of unfair criticism plus malicious intent and woeful
ignorance.
That tiie statements emanating from such sources
should be taken with a very large handful of the
proverbial salt is amply demonstrated by the fore­
going specific instance. Hence it is no surprise to
And that credit for the very handsome gains made in
Other classes of prtiperty is unblusiiingly given to the
tax commission, although that interesting body had
no seat on the state board of equalization, no voice
fn its deliberations and no influence with its members.
Seal property was raised from $199,073,743 in 1912 to
$206,131,797 In 1913. How strenuously the tax com
•iftMlon, unrepresented on the state board sans
••.miif, awns influence, sans authority, must have
Wislsi Dlnnrt to secure this six million dollar raise.
By what VNftrd trance treatment did this delectable
triumvirate add four millions to the item of personal
property? Did they hold their respective breaths
and wish ovfr two millions onto the item of railways,
sixty thousand onto telegraph, seventy thousand onto
telephone* a/id over thirty thousand onto express
companies? If so, why in the name of Ananias did
they not tgfld on a little longer nnd wish that item
of $1,410 fhto the error column, where it belonged,
instead of'using it as a hammer to slander the gov­
ernor?
This screed is already too long for such a con­
temptible subject, but it is only right to state what
the real facte are surrounding the increase of prop­
erly valuations throughout the statu. North Dakota
is growing our population is now well over 600,000
our people have prospered our railways and other
public utilities have prospered with them. The state
board of equalization recognized these facts. It was
their business to do so. The board is composed of
upright, level-headed business men, well versed in
alate-crjift and thoroughly alive to actual conditions.
They did their duty as they saw it and their experi­
ence prompted. And they did a mighty good job, one
which sets'st new standard in the state's financial
condition and one of which every right thinking citi­
zen has a right to, and does, feel proud.
The tax commission had nothing to do with if.
King George is expected to have better luck with
his announcement requiring officers not in uniform
to wear silK hats than "t'-te queen had in abolishing
the turkey trot and the slashed skirt.
Doctor Montessori's Visit
Americans are soon to have an opportunity to see
and hear Dr. Mariu Montessori, the famous Italian
teacher, and observe for themselves her much dis­
cussed methods of teaching ypung children. Madame
Montessori will arrive in thfikcountry today, to give
a seriep of/4ectures on tiie-
(jviai'k
of her schools in
home. SheMwill be accompanied by an interpreter,
in order to'be able to use her native Italian. She is
bringing with her moving pictures illustrative of the
work as it is actually carried on in the "House of
Childhood."
Madame Montessori's tour will be under the aus­
pices of the Montessori Educational Association of
America, of which Mrs. Alexander Graham Bell is
president, Dr. P. P. Claxton, U. S. Commissioner of
Education, first vice president, and Col. McClure of
New York, second vice president. .Miss Margaret
Wilson, daughter of the President, is a member of
the board of trustees of the association, and will be
active in thg^reception to be accorded to Dr. Montes­
sori at the jttaional capital.
Dr. 'Montessori will be in the United States about
three weeks. She will visit eight or ten cities east
of the Mississippi, beginning with Washington which
is the headquarters of the Montessori association.
She does not. expect to be able to go very far south
or west on this trip.
It is a wise diplomatic appointee who delays en­
gaging hissteanjship passage until the last minute.
McHarg and Republican Reunion
Ormsby McHarg thinks next spring too early for
the holding'6t a national convention with the object
of bringing'Republicans and Progressives together
under the old party name for work against the Democ­
racy, says the Washington Star. He suggests that
the meeting be postponed until after the next con­
gressional elections.
Next spring is preferable on two accounts
(1) The next- Congress will be chosen largely on the
tariff issue, .and (2) another division among protec­
tionists wilF inevitably give the Democrats another
victory at tiie poKs. How would that contribute to
the cause of!'.a reunion of the protectionists?
A fairiiiy'irow is the bitterest of all rows, arid the
ot ener the hair-pulling takes place the more difficult
a re0.'j:istnj.Uitcf affairs becomes. The protectionists
list a valuable opportunity this year. Had they com­
posed their differences in New Jersey and Massachu­
setts—both ^manufacturing states—success over the
Democrats Would have been achieved, and been quot­
able against the anti-protectionists: But they1 again
divided, and. a' victory of the minority thus obtained
has been quoted as another Condemnation of the pol­
icy of protection.
Next year the issue will be spread all over the
country. In" every congressional district, except in
the south, where only one party exists, the tariff will
be a factor in the contest and voters asked to record
themselves with regard to it. Unless protectionists
agree meanwhile to stand .together at thatlt$ne an­
other Democratic Congresf will be a certaintyand
1916 will open with the anti-protectionists in full
control of the government.
Eut whenever the national convention is held—
next spring or the spring after—Mr. McHarg should.
be sent as-adelegate. He has information which the
convention should have and doubtless he will be will­
ing to give" the convention the benefit of it. And
offered from the floor by a delegate it would have a
more pronounced effect than if contributed in the
shape of a.ljtter or newspaper interview by a looker
on at the meeting.
This information relates to conditions in the south,
where the Republican party is a mere shell, and,
while election matters continue down there as they
now are, cannot be more. Mr. McHarg made a thor­
ough study of them early last year, and appeared at
the Republican national convention with a program
for voting that whole section for Mr. Roosevelt. The
Republican National committee defeated his plan but
that fate did not deprive the plan of a certain interest,
which, indeed, still attaches tc.i^.
If "13" is really a lucky number sir Thomas Lip
ton has only to build nine more Shamrocks.
Whether or not he permits himself to become an
accredited diplomat, Mr. McCombs will command a
great deal of admiration as a very tactful person.

Following is the decision of the su­

In the Supreme Court, State of
North Dakota.
State of North Dakota, plaintiff and
respondent, vs. George L. Bickford,
defendant and appellant.
(1) Evidence examined and held I
sufficient to justify a conviction of
the crime of embezzlement under sec-1
tions 9204, 9205, R. C. 1905
(2) Information examined and held
to charge one, and not several offen-1
ses.
(3) -Section 9205, R. C. 1905, des
cribes but one general crime of em-1
bezzlement, which may be committed
in different ways, and the same may
be charged in different courts alleg­
ing the various ways by which the
same was accomplished.
(4) Where the statute declares an
act unlawful when perpetrated in any
one or all of several modes, the in­
formation may charge the act in se­
parate counts, basing each count up­
on the different modes specified.
(5) Although it may be the gener­
al rule in the case of a felony that
the court will permit the prosecution
to give evidence of only bnfe feloni­
ous transaction, it is also t|ie rule
that when it appears more than one
criminal transaction involved and the
joinder of the different counts is
meant only to meet the various as­
pects in which the evidence may pre­
sent itself, the court will not restrict
the prosecuting officer to particular
counts and will suffer a general ver­
dict to be taken'Oh the whole.
(6) A verdict of "guilty of embez­
zlement as- charged'- in the informa­
tion," is sufficient in a prosecution for
having committed the crime of em­
bezzlement condemned by section 92
05, R. C. 1905, in the different man­
ners described in said section. Such
a verdict is a general verdict and has
the same effect aa the verdict, of
"guilty," provided for in section
10-044, R. C. 1905.

Tin Changing
Age
Girls and boys from 14 to 19 years
of age undergo physical changes
which tax their strength to. the utmost
and the strain is always apparent from
pale cheeks, colorless lips, and tired
bodies—sometimes eruptions of the skin
and the utter lack of the ambition and
animation with "which their younger
years were filled.
Budding into womanhood and man­
hood, with the duties of school or business,
demands concentrated nourishment
which is readily convertible into red blood
corpuscles, energy and strength, and th*
very best thing for tbis changing age is
the medical nutriment in Scott's Emul­
sion—it possesses the rare blood-making
properties of cod liver oil in a predi
gested form hypophosphites for the
nervous system, with the healing, sooth
ing qualities of pure glycerine.
Its nourishing force promotes assimila­
tion, yields direct returns in abundant,
red blond, fills hollow cheeks, tones tbe
nerves, mak'ss all gooda food do good,
and does'it a natural easy manner.
The sustaining nourishment in Scott's I
Emulsion is so helpful to this changing
age that it should never be neglected—
every druggist has it.

Dear Sir:
I have this year another of those fine Herkimer county, New
Vork, cheeses—weighs 1,160 pounds. It's the finest cheese on the
market and the flavor is especially delicious because large cheeses
of this kind have a taste that no smaller cheese ever has. I've had
one of these every Christmas season for a number of years, and the
demand is so great some people do not get in till too late and are
disappointed.
This cheese will not be cut till December 16,. but orders are
being taken now. Send in your order for live, ten or twenty-five
pounds. The price is 30 cents a pound for five pounds or less—
2S cents a pound for orders over five pounds. Don't delay—order
now.
You can keep this cheese as well as the maker—just melt a lit­
tle puraffine and cover the cheese with a thin coating. It stays
fresh and delicious till you want to use it. It is the finest table
cheese you ever tasted and for rare-bits has no equal.
If you send in you order promptly, I'll save whatever sized piece
you want. If you delay it may be all gone, and you'll miss the
greatest, delicacy of the season.

.umuliition of peculations, the aggre­
gate misappropriation may be treated
as one crime and all the peculations
as parts of the one offense, and the
aggregate shortage proven may be
more or less than the sum stated in
the information.
(S) It is not necessary that the
exact sum embezzled should be alleg­
ed, nor is it necessary to prove the
exac! sum as charged.
(9) The crime of embezzlement
l.y a public officer does not merely
consist in failing to turn over all mon­
eys to the state at the time of the re­
linquishment of hi soffice, but in hav­
ing fradudulently converted money or
securities while in that office. The
mere' fact, therefore, that a friend
may come to one's rescue and furnish
money sufficient to make good a
shortage on a final accounting, does
not. in' any way negative ~the fact' that
prior to such final accounting money
has been fradudulently converted,
that.is to say embezzled.
(10) A special deposit is a bail­|
ment of certain specified property,
which can be an dis to be indentified
and'returned.
(11) A special deposit as used in
paragraph 14. of section 111, R. C.
1005, implies tiie placing of money in
a bank for safe-keeping, so that the
manker is a bailee and must keep the
identical money without mingling it
with the other funds of the bank, to
be returned in kind to the state trea­
surer or such person or persons as
he may direct.
(12) A deposit in a bank is not a
special deposit where the banker is
allowed to loan out or to use the mon­
ey deposited. A special deposit in­
volves safe-keeping merely and the
return of the identical money or ar­
ticles deposited.
(13) The crime of embezzlement
may be committed by a fraudulent
failure to account for funds as well ai
by physical confiscation
(14) The order of iproof upon the
trial of a cause is largely within the
control of the trial judge and his
discretio nmust largely control.
(15) The objection that the testi­
mony "is not the best evidence, in­
competent as such, irrelevant and im­
material," does not raise or suggest
the objection that sujch testimony is
not proper or rebuttal.

TO RESUME~HEARING IN ANTI­
TRUST CASE.
Boston, Mass., Dec. 2.—The case of
the United States against the United
Shoe Machinery company for alleged
violation of the Sherman anti-trust
law will be reopened before the full
'bench of the United States court .to
1 morrow, unless a further postpone­
ment is agreed upon by counsel. The
case was suspended late in June and
transferred to a special examiner for
the purpose of hearing testimony on
patents. The hearings before the ex
laminer have occupied nearly all of
the eummer and ai^utnn,. and Jt is
predicted triat the bearings before the
I full bench will consume another two
lor three months. The case is one of
the most important of the anti-trust
prosecutions begun during, the last
I year of the Taft administration.
