The refumption tf specie pyments hs

rqual citrpetion with other nattors in

which was redeemable under the pre.-ent

To secure this important reduction cf

THE SILVER mLUlIt.
The pendency of the proposition for
unity of acion between the United Slates
and the principal crmrercial nations of
Kurope, to eff ct a permanent system for
the equality of gold ami -ilver in the
recognized mosey of the world, leads me to
recommend that Congress refrain from
new legislation on the general subject. The
great revival of tride", internal and foreign,
will supply, during the comine year, its
own instructions, which may well be awaited
bclore attempting further experimental
measures with the coinage. I would,
however, strongly urge upon Corgre-s the
importance of anthorizing the Secretary of
the Treasury to eupecd the coinage cf
kilrer dollars upon the present legal
ratio. The mtrfcet valae of the eilver
dollar being uniformly and lately less
than the market value of thegold dollar, it is
obriouily impracticable to maintain them
t par with each other if both a re coined
without limit. Jf the cheapsr coin ia forced
into ciicnlation it will, if coined without
limit, soon become the sole standard cf
Talne, aad thm defeat the desired oojec',
whick i ft currcccy of both (old sad ailrer

CIVIL EEM'ICE.
In a former message I invited the atten
tion of Congress to the subject of the refor
mation of tne civil service of the Govern
ment, and expretscd the intention of trans
mittinc to Congress as earlv as. practicable
a report upon this subject by the chairman
of the Civil-Servic-Commis-ion
Inviewof the facts lhat, durin; a con
siderable period, the Government of Great
Iiritain has been dealing with administra
tive problems and abuse, in various par
ticulars analogous to thje presented in
this country, and that in recent years the
measures adopted were understood to have
been effective and in every respect hi hly
satisfactory, I thought it desirable to have
fulier tinformation upon the rub
ject, and accordicgly requested the chair
man of the Civii-Service Commission to
innke a tborough investigation for this
purpose. The result has been zn elabor
ate nnd comprehensive report.
Tcj re port eeta forth the history of
Tnn partisan etoils system
in Great Britain, and of the rise and fall of
the parliamentary patronage, and ol oth:ial
interference with the freedom of elections.
it i-hows that after long trial cf various
kinds rf examinations, tho-e which are
competiiive and ojen on iqual terms to
all, and which are cirried on under the su
petintendence of a sirglecommission.have,
ith great advantage, been established as
condiiiots of admission to almcst every
cf2:ial place in the subordinate adminis
tration cf that country nrd of li.-itish In
dia. Tha completion of the report, owing
to the extent of the labor involved in its
preparation, and the omision of Congress
to make any provision either for the com
pexsation or the expeoes of the Commis
sion, has been postponed until the p-eent
time. Ii is herewith transmitted to Con-gre-s.
Wnile the reform measures of another
government are cf no authority for us, they
are entitled to inHaer.ce, to tne extent to
which tteir inttiosic widom and their
adaptation to our institution and social
life may commend them to our considera
tion.
Tne views I have heretofore expressed
concerning the
DETECTS ASD ABUSES
in our civil administration remain un
changed, except in so far as an enlarged
experience has deepened my sense of the
duty both of oScers and of the people
themselves to co-operate for their removal,
fhe grave evils atd perils of a partisan
spoils stsiem of appointment to crSce and
of cfSce tenure, are now generally recog
nized. In the resolutions of the great par
ties, in the reports of departments, in the
debates and nroeeklinga of Congress, in the
messages of Executives, the gravity of
these evils hts been pointed cut ana the
need of their reform has been admitted.
To command the nece-ary support every
measure of refcrm must be Cased on com
mon right end justice, and must be com
patible with the healthy existence of great
parties, which are inevitable and essential
in a free State
When the people hare approved ft policy
at a r
. - w katiosai. elzctios,
conC2eace on the psrt of the ofucers they
have selected, and of the advisers who, in
accordance with our political lutilutiocs.
fhonld be consulted, ia the policy which it
is their duty to carry into ehect, is xcdia
reusable. ' '3 eminently proper thct
they should explain it before the people.
as well aa ina3ira:e iu spirit ia
the performance of their official duties.
Very different considerations arply to the
greater cumber of those who Gil the
fcUBORDISATE PLACES
in the civil service. Their responaiblily is
to their superiors in cfHcial position. It is
their duty to obey the legal irstrurtions of
thee upon whom that authority is de
volved; and their best public eervice con
sists in the discharge cf their functiors ir
respective of partisan politics TLeir du
ties are the same, whatever psr.y is in
power acd whatever policy prevails. As a
conseqnence, it follows lhat their tenure of
cfBce should cot depend on the prevalcr.ee
of any olicy cr the supremacy of any
party, but thould be determined by thir
capacity to s;rve the people most usefully,
qiite irrespective cf partisan interest
l'he sjmecocsiderationsthat shcnld govern
the leaure, should also prevail iu the
appointment, dis-Jpline and removal of
tbei-e subordinates. The au hority of ap
qoin'meat end removal is not a per
pui'ite, vhich may be ued :o ail a friend
or reward a partisan, I) Jt is a trust to be
exercued in the pnblic interest, under all
the sanctions wh c!i attend the obligation
to spply the public funds orjy for public
purposes,
Kvery citizn has an cqatl right to the
honor asd profit of entering the
rCBLIC EERVICE
cf hU country. The only jat round rf
discrimination, is the measure of chancer
and capacity he has to make that service
most useful to the people, Kxcept iu copes
whrrf, upo i jr-t and rcognizd principle,
nr-' ry of pensions, c Sices and
r.w. . bestowed as rewards for
past t y , iheir bestowal uion any
theory ''-regards jiersonal merit, is
ii- i ' , -e to the citizjii", as well
a t trust eubj.'Ct to which
I aj .oiatic , ower is held.
I the light of these pricdplxs it be
ccm8 of gteat importance to provide ju-t
and
ADEQUATE MEANS',
especially for every department and large
administrative office, where personal dis
crimination on the part cf its head is not
practicable, for ascertaining these r.nalifi-
cations to which appointments acd iemov-
als should have relcrecce. lo 1H to pro
vide such means is not only to deny the
oppor'unity of sf tertainic the facts upon
which the most righteous claim tocttica
depends, but, of cecas'ity, to di-courace all
worthy aspirants, by handing over appoint
ments, to mere icllnence 2nd fav ritism
If it is the right of the wor liist claimant
to gain the appointment, acd the interest
of the people to bet-tow it upon him, it
would seem clear that a wise and J'lst
method of ascertaining peraccal Gtncsi for
office must be an important and permanent
function of every just and wie govern
ment. It has Jong since become impo'sibie
in the great offices, for tfaotc usviog the
duty ot nomination and appointment, to
personally examine into the icdividuil
qualifications of more than i small pro
portion of tLose seeling cfS.e; and, with
the enlargement of the civil f erf ice, that
proportion must continue to become lets
' In ths earlier years of the Government
mE SUBDRDIL'ATE orriCES
were so few in number thst it was qui'e
easy for those making appointments and
promotions to personally at certain the
merits of candidates. Party managers acd
methods had not then become (sowerful
agencies of coercion, hostile to the free and
ust exerciie of the appointing power.
A. large csd rezponsildo part of the duty
ol
RE3r0RIN-a THE CIVIL EFRYIL'E
to the desired purity and efficiency rests
upon the I resident, and it is my purpose
to do what is within my power to advance
sqch prudent and gradual measures of
refoici aa wijl most mrely and rapidiy
bring about thst radical charge of system
essential to make our administrative meth
ods ealisftctiry to a free and intelligent
people. Ily a proper txeici-e of authority
it is in the poi.tr of the Executive to do
much to promote such a reform. Hut it
cannot be too (.'early understood that noth
ing adequate can 1m accomplished ailLoat
co-opera atn on the part of Congress and

generally accepted theories of parties Ei;d

permanent Jonrditiois mii't le laid in

demourtratt their wiwlcni and expo"t the
errors of their adversaries. Every wciiby
officer dcsiris to make his clScial action a
gain and an honor to his country, but the
peoi.le themselves, far more than llieir cfH-
cera in public sts'icn, are interffti-d m a
puic, economical, sna vigorous inmims
iralicrz. Ily laws euUrd in 1Sj.1 end 1S15, ecd
now in t utHtacce incorporated iu the Ke

statutes are a di sina by (.'ongrrs lhat ex
aminations of e 'ie rort, as to attainmems
and capacity, re es-entiai to the well

questions since tiie enactm ntof these laws
have Leen as to tie ensrae- r ol mee ex
amina)ions, and whether c tfi -ial favor and
partisan influence, or con- Jion right acd
merit, were to control tbe iccess to the ex
aminations. In practice tbese examina
tions have not always bee i open to vorthy
persons generally, who might wish to be

designated tho.v rho alone were permitted
to go before the inclining tosrds, sub
jecting even the examiners 'o a pressure
from the friends of the candidates v ry dif
ficult to resi-t. As a con-tqaence, the
tandsrd of admission fell Ul w that
which the public intcre-t demanded. It
was almost inevitable that a system which
provided for various separate bor.rds of
examiners, with no common supervi-icn or
uniform method of procedure, should re
sult in confusion, inconsistency, and insJe
quale tests of capacity highly detrimental
to the public interests. A further and moie
radical change wa cbvi-udy rfqii'rid.
In the annual mefsge ef P.cember,
1S70, my predecis-or declared that 'there
is no duty which so much tmbarr.if.-es the
executive and heads of Pep&rtments a

such arduous and thaculcss lal-or lmpr-ed

under uniform supervision, a cumber cf
eminently competent persons were selec'ed
for the purpo-e, who entered with zeal
upon the discharge ot their duties, pre
pared, with an intelligent sppreciation cf
the rniuiremnts of the service, the regult
tioi-s contemplated, and took charge cf the
examinations, acd who, in their capardty
as a board, have been known as the "Civil
Service Commission." Congress for two
yeara appropriated ibe money needed for
the compensation and tor tue exi-enfs ot
carrying on the woik of the Commission.
It appears lrom the report ol tne Lorn-
mission, submitted to tne President in
April, 1S74, that examinations had teen
held in various sections of the country.
acd that an appropriation cf about $25,000
would be required to meet the annual ex
pecses, incltidirg salaries, involved ia dis
charging the
scTirs or the comnssiox.
The report was transmitted to Corgre.s
by special message of April 18, 1874, with
the following favorable comment upon the
labors of the Commission: "If sustained
by Congress. I have no doubt the rules can,
after the experience gained, be so improved,

benefit the public service and relieve the

as they have hitherto oeen eciorceo, cave
resulted beneficially, as is shown by the
opinions of the members of the Caitnet and
their subordinates in the Departments, acd
in that opinion I concur." And in the an
nual messs gs of December of the same
year similar views are expressed, acd an
appropriation tor continuing the were oi
the Commission pgain advised.
The appropriation was not inrds, acd as
a consequence, the active work of the Com
rol'sion was suspended, leavitg the C m
misston itself still in existence. Without
the means, therefore, of causing qualifica
tions 10 be tested in any systematic manner,
or of eecuring for tha public eervice the
advantages of competition upon any ex
tensive plan, I recommended in my annual
message of December, 1S77, the making of
an appropriation for the resumption of the
work of the Commission.
