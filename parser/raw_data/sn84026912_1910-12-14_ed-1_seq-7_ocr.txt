Married >it Mississippi, Heid" und
Plckens County, Doc. 1.-Special:
lt was a beautiful morning on the
8th of November, 1910. A large
collection of buggies could have
been seen In a barnyard of a pros
porous farmer of upper South Caro
lina. It was tho occasion of the as
sembling of friends and relatives to
thc fiftieth anniversary of tho mar
riage of Mr. and M i's. J. H. Law
rence. Tho beautiful, warm Novem
ber day, tho geniality of tho guests
and the occasion made the day one
long to be remembered by nil who
? ok part in the reception. Liberty
and friendship seemed to pervade
tho hearts ol' all present, and no
stiffness or formality was manifested
-an ideal occasion for sweot com
munion of friends and the meeting
of long absent chums.
lt wns also a time of reunion of
one of the largest living families of
Picketts county. Mr. and Mrs. Law
rence are blessed willi twelve chil
dren, seven boys and five girls. All
are living, and on November Sib
cuino together to witness the golden
wedding of their mother and father.
Some are married and have families
of their own; one a Protestant min
ister of tho Flat woods country of
North Georgia, and another enc of
Oconee's most prosperous farmers.
Several others are scattered hero
and there, but most of the family
Billi live under the parental roof.
The particulars of this unusual
wedding anniversary may be ol* in
terest to the general reader. Late
in Hie evening of the 7th friends and
family of the honored pair began to
assemble about tho old home hearth
.the sumo old hearth-stone by
which Mr. Lawrence was rocked as
a baby, seventy-eight years ago, and
hy \Vhi[ch his family gathered during
his years of childhood and young
manhood. Ile has seen lils own
children play by it, and now, after
Illly years of married life, it is hero
that they gather io celebrate his an
niversary. Now was a time for re
joicing. Mother onco more came into
the loving embrace of long-absent
son and daughter, and father took
upon his lap his grandchild ron, and
rocked them to sleep as of yore his
own children. Late in the night was
heard the patter of little feet and
the hum of voices singing the gentle
chant of the loving reunion.
^ Hut rpi' the morrow was the most
rejoicing. HjiW' of/.alk' The other
ih'eiribers of the family arrived, and
ail were united around the home
hearth. Old grannies and cooks
Came tn, and their merry smiles and
loud laughter was added to Ihe mur
mur of the kettle and tho rattle of
dishes, tho bark of the house-dog
and the song of the sawyer. For a
limo all was hustle and confusion,
running here and there, happy
greetings of friends, tho morry in
troduction of strangers. Soon all
were gathered In the parlor, and a
beautiful and appropriate ceremony
was performed by Kev. J, L. Har
rington, ex-president of the Wesley
an Methodist College at Central, as
sisted by Hov. S. I. Keeler. The
ceremony not only recalled tho one
of fifty years ago, and gave a
glimpse of the life of loving fidelity
to the present, but lt also pointed
to the future and the hope of par
ticipating in "the marriage supper
of the Lamb."
Tho history of this long united
pair ls very Interesting. They wore
married near Hie present elly of Me
ridian, Miss., November 8th, 186Q,
tho ceremony being performed by
Kev. Phillips, a Presbyterian minis
ter. Bofore the marriage the bride
was Miss Sallie A. Rhode. Her sis
tor, Miss Lizzie Rhode, was present
at tho wedding, and afterward be
camo tho wife of W. H. Lawrence,
brother of J. H. Lawrence. She was
tho only ono present at thc first mai'
ringo wild was also present at the
golden wedding. J, H. and W. B.
Lawrence aro tho only surviving
members of their generation of tho
two families.
As their wedding occurred many
years ago when but few railroads
ran through tho South, tho newly
wedded groom and his young bride
traveled the long journey from Mis
sissippi to South Carolina through
.the country. It was in tho days of
slavery, and thoy, of course, had
sovoral to accompany thom, ns ser
vants, on the way. Dut soon their
?wedded bliss was changed to some
thing of Borrow!, Tho great Civil
War was just beginning its long
bloody career of desolation. Mr.
Lawrence, thou 'h bound to his homo
hy tho Hes of matrimonial affection,
heard tho call of his country, should
ered tho rifle and wont away to bat
tle for tho Confedorato causo. Sad
and hoart-broaklng must havo been
that hasty departure. Thoy might
never soo each other again! Long
and lonely did tho bride wait for
the return of her lover; many times
did she strain her oars to catc?t the
faintest whispers from the distant
field of conflict. Dut through the

M. P. Ansel for Judgeship.
A dispatch from Washington says
President Taft has completed his
message to Congress, and that he is
now studying the list of applicants
for the vacant, place in tim Court of
Commerce, recently created by Con
gress. This announcement is of in
terest to South Carolina because
Governor Ansel ls one among the
two score applicants.
Information from a reliable source
bas lt "that (?overnor Ansel stands a
fair chance to being a member of
the court and that lils name has been
most favorably presented to tho
President.
It ls known that almost a score of
the Governors nave written personal
letters to Pr?sident Taft urging tho
appoint ment of Governor Ansel, of
this State.
The appointment, will very likely
bo made during the present week
just after the meeting of Congress.
Tho position carries a salary of
$7,500.
Governor Ansel has neither con
firmed or denied the rumors to the
effect that be is seeking Hie position.
Ho ls very retlcont, as on all ques
tions of this nature, and always pre
fers not to make an announcement
until action has been taken. This
characteristic has been consistently
followed during lils entire adminis
tration as Governor of South Caro
lina.
Besides tho Governor, endorsing
Governor Ansel, there have boen
many letters sent to Washington
from oilier friends.
kindness of God the sad news "dead
on tho battlefield," never came. Af
ter many hardships and trials, after
having boen incarcerated in a Fede
ral prison, and wounded by the ene
my for his patriotism, tho young
husband returned to tho bosom of
his faithful wife and they wore des
tined to live long and happily to
gotber, fulfilling tho vows made on
that November day In 18(10.
But In thoso hard times suhsc
quent *o tho Civil War joy was not
the only thing that pervaded the
hearts of tho couple, in those dark
days Integrity, manliness and perse
verance wero needed to stem the
tide of tendency. Mri and Mrs. Law
renco wero amply provided with
those, and came out uncorrupted
from tho dishonesty and confusion
of fho times, proving tho truthful
ness of tho beautiful lines of Young:
"Tho man who consecrates his
hours
By vigorous effort, and an honest
a i m,
At once he draws the sting of lifo
and death;
Ile walks with nature, and her paths

SOUTH ANO TUB CORN CROP.
Nothing to Keep Us from Becoming
Richest Section in Union.
(Hartwell Sun.)
If anybody had predicted a few
years ago that the corn crop of the
South would, In the near future, in
fluence the cotton market be would
have boen called a dreamer. It was
thought then that tho South was BO
ilrmly wedded to cotton, and that
her average yield of corn per acre
was so small that she would never
become a large producer of corn.
Hut tho farmers of the South have
been doing a good deal of thinking
these.last few years, with the result
that this yr:, .?ie corn production of
fourteen Southern States amounts to
nearly i,0u0,000,000 bushels. That
is a record to be proud of.
Instead of depending upon the
West for her corn the South will
soon have corn to sell. The yield of
the whole country is only a little
more than 3,000,000,000 bushels,
and the South is producing nearly a
third of it. And the South is only
beginning to grow lt on tho Inten
sive plan. During this year her
boys' corn club>s have demonstrated
that on Southern soil as many bush
els |>er note can be grown as In the
West. The South hasn't boon neg
lecting cotton. More acres of that
plant are being cultivated than ever
before, but both corn and cotton are
being given better cultivation. Hence
the larger yield.
The fact that Southern corn is In
fluencing the price of that article in
the markets of the world is certain
lo be a big advertisement for the
South. The West baa always iiad
the impression that the South could
not. grow corn profitably, and that,
therefore, she wasifi adapted to the
raising of cattle and hogs. The
South's corn crop tills year will
bring about a change in Hint im
pression. lt will open tho eyes of
the world to thc- fact that the South
can compete with tin; North in tho
raising of ea'tie and hogs, and hence
in the course of a comparatively few
years we may reasonably expect to
see great packing houses in the
Southern states-packing houses
that will not only supply the home
market, but help to supply foreign
markets.
And there is another thing the
world is going to learn In tho near
future, and that is that the South
eau raise hay in competition with
the North. At the conference of Ibo
State commissioners of agriculture
in Atlanta recently the commissioner
of Mississippi said that the farmers
of his State were meeting with great
success in raising* alfalfa. ll* that
remarkable plant will thrive in Mis
sissippi there is no reason why lt
will not thrive in every other South
ern State. It ls being expev" len ted
with here in Georgia and also in
South Carolina, and there is every
reason for thinking that the experi
ments will be successful. With corn
and alfalfa in abundance, and a mo
nopoly in cotton, what is to hinder
the South from becoming the richest
part of the United States?

Charleston, Dec. S.-Following

tho Methodist Conference, Bishop

struck a blow at the habits of chew
ing and smoking tobacco. The
bishop admitted that at ono time he
had used tobacco, but he had long
ago roached the conclusion that God
had not called him to be "either
a steam engine or a spittoon."
