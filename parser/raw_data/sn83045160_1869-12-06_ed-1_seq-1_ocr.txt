The Short-Sightedness of the People by a
St. Louis Joanul.
What We Were, Are. a-d are Doilg. by a
Corresnondent.
The Ht. Louis Tim) of Friday says:
Geo. P. Plant, Eq., President of the
Merchants' Exchange, has addressed
a letter to I:i j. M. J. Wicks, Presi
dent of the M"tn'hl and Charleston
Railroad, stating su.-einotly and in a
business-like way, the importance of
cheaper and improved facilities for
the transfer of freight from the boats
of the packet company to the cars at
Memphis.
This is a matter to w hich wo have
frequently adverted, and shall con
tinue strenuously to advocate, until
the imcrative needs referred to are
fully Ml
A proposition and an admirable
one it was for the establishment ot a
union depot at some accessible point
upon the Memphis levee, was recently
introduced in the Common Council oi
that city, in the form of a petition
from Mr. Wicks, of the Charlesioti
Road, and Capt. H. W. Smith, of the
hasM'acket Companv. asking the right of
way through the city and the requisite
privileges upon the landing; but,
strange to say, it was given the very
coldest shoulder ol tliat municipal
body, and disused of in a manner
certainly more summary than wise.
This singular action of the Memphis
City Council seems furthermere to
have been approved, if not dictated,
by the local pre-vs, and many of the
prominent business men of the town,
who certainly
tand much in their
own liirlit in
this narrow and con
tracted policy.
We can appreciate, of course, the
unwillingness of our Memphis friends
Q. M a distributing point am
; route of trade between St.
Lqu d the interi(,r ,south ,,ut tllc.
LNe business men of that city very
k h , th d )(jr
...,. .:7iotSnn.
! gtand hl thj f m enter
prise, aud that all efforts to blockade,
bv exhorbitant and ruinous transfer
charges, the natural channels of
trade, musyof necessity prove injuri
ous in the end to the city or the indi
viduals who thus assume to thwart
and embarrass the economic transpor
tation of Southern freights.
The great river that washes the
levee at Memphis should teach her
citizens the striking resemblance be
tween the laws of nature aud the
equally inexorable laws of commerce.
Wherever the current of this mighty
stream comes iu contact with any ob
stacle to its progress, if it does not
force its way through, as its natural
tendency i, go around, it must, and
invariably does.
So with the current of trade. It is
impossible to dam it up. Its courso is
not to be checked by city councils or
aldermunic wisdom; and Meiuphi- or
a;;y other city attempting to restrain
it, 'will Ik? circumvet.ltd at the last, if
not altogether ignored.
The ira ic oi St. Louis with the
South, already of immense proportion--,
is daily increasing, and must
continue to increase. It must, of!
course, tir.d its way to the interior of
the Southern States by the cheat -:
and most hejihle route. It cannot
afford to pay extoriionate tribute to
Memphis, and unle-s the people of
that citv exercise a more liberal and
' magnanimous spirit they must, sooner
: or later lo-e every advantage pertain- i
, ing tp. their port as a point of com
mercial traiiiiipment.
There are other routes South, which
must aud ill be adopted by our mer. ,
chants, unless our friends at Memphis
i accept the inevitable situation, aud by
. business-like legislation, make that
city as they may, the permanent dis
tributive point ot our vast and in- :
' creasing trade.
j The impositions now placed ujxin
; ou.r shippers are no longer endurable.
: While the cost of transfer at Cairo.
; from rail to boat, is but two-aud-a-i
half cents per hundred pounds on pro
duce, aud tive cents on merchandise;
while at Columbus, under eOHflnot
with Mr. Halliday, it costs but five
cents a hundred to transfer from the
river to toe Memphis and Ohio road,
the average expense of moving freight
from the .Memphis landing to the cars
Ls fully twelve cents a hundred, and
frequently rlaei to fifteen cents, or
three to four times the cost ol tran
shipment at Cairo, Hickman or Co
lumbus. The extraordinary expMMBBef the
Packet company at" Memphis for the i
single month of October, we are as
sured, were $l0,0no for the single item
of labor, when, with proper depot fa
cilities and the requisite tramways,
the whole bill could be tooted tor not
to exceed $:i,ooo.
The cost, in fact, of transhipment
at Mtmpiiis is now fully equal to the
freightage h nv to Cairo, by river, or
from Menipius i :ila.nil a hundred
miles by rail.
This condition of things must be !
revoliitUHii'. d. The people of Mem-i
phis have it in their pom to do it, or
by negkvtintr the opportunity, to lose
altogether the great commercial im
portance which is by nature theirs.
Believing that our readers would
iike to see our city as others see it, we 1
present the following from a letter by
a correspondent of the BJejMMi City
lime, who wrote from Memphis a
few days agi I :
Memphis, some two years ago, had j
a population of over 6O,(00. Its reverse.-
lasy slid to have commenced
at that time. High rents Were con
tinued aud exacted as during the war.
One to two hundred jer cent, were
obtained for goods which absorbed
the resources of the farming commu
nity. PMWfli and plunder were re- 1
sorted to; legions of negroes were
brought from th country tot the pur
pose of voting their assumed benefac
tors into office; the white m Jn tor
want of sutlicient labor or uo lalior at
all became demoralised; murder and
burglary were familiar items on the
iKjlice register; through the tmbecntty

of the law officers, artly from the in
Huen of urtvi-dt-nts, but more from

of those criminals were permitted to
go unpunished. A respectable jury
was a sight of rare occurrence. Seve
ral thousands of g'iod, peaceable citi
zens left b-re and one-third of the nier
chants were forced into bankruptcy.

season toanother. Business is not pros

The following propositions were re

NW YotiK, December 4. The Her
ald, in commenting upon the increas-
ing shipments of wheat and flour
: down the Mississippi river to New
Orleans for fhipment to England
says, against the Southern water-line
of the Mississippi, the only competi
, tion for the Northwestern grain trade
that will pay in the East will be the
j water-lineof the St. Lawrence down
to the sea. Hence the annexation of
the Dominion down to the sea is more
and more becoming a necessity to tfce
great grain-growing shippers of ffte

Cur Nsxc Census.
The New York Tribune says that
Dr. Jarvis, of Boston, has beer; guess
ing' at the results qf our ninth census,
which wiil be taken next summer
probably in June. He guesses that
the total population of the United
State (excluding Indians not taxed)
will be :W,blit,ll., whereof 4,G4,-41S
will be cwlored. As the total popula
tion in Hsijo was ol,4i;5,"9, the esti
mated iiicrvaseexct'eds eight millions,
and is considerably above twenty-five
per cent. Considering that we have
had lour years of desperate, bloody
civil war in this decade, this increase
must be deemed remarkable, even ad
mitting that we owe a good share of
it to immigration.
We doubt that the colored popula
tion will be found so. numerous as Dr.
Jarvis estimates. While we do not
credit half that is reported ol their
licentiousness, dissinatiuti and exces-
niortality, we presume that the
rl break-up of homes and habits
re?5,!,B? frr,n emancipation in tllP
midst of civil war has precluded auy
considerable increase of their numlier
since In), when they were returned
as
Slaves.
Free. .

.... 4f7,tfy
Total 4,441,756
Not being re-enforced, as the whites
so strongly are, by a vigorous and pro
lific in migration, we doubt tliat the
colored total next year will exceed
