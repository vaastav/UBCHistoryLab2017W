GREAT WEALTH OF THE ISLAND
AS SHOWN BY EXPORTS AND
IMPORTS REQUESTS CONGRESS
I
TO CONFER RIGH1S OF AMERI
CAN CITIZENSHIP UPON ISLAND
ERS WITHOUT DELAY
By Asaoclated Press
Washington Dec 11The presi
d nts special message to congress
giving the result of his recent obser
atlons in Porto Rico aI urging sev
tral recommendations concerning the
government of the island was deliv
ered to the senate today It was
read at length and received careful
attention The message Is as follows
The Message e
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives
On November 21 1 visited the island
of Porto Rico landing at Ponce cross
ing by the old Spanish road by Cavey
to San Juan and returning next morn
ing over the new American road from
Arecibo to Ponce the scenery was
wonderfully beautiful especially
Inong the mountains of the interior
which constitute a veritable tropc
Switzerland I could not embark at
Sm Juan because the harbor has not
lieon dredged out and can not receive
nn American battleship I do not
think this fact creditable to us as a
nation and I earnestly hope that im
mediate provision will be made for
dreuping San Juan harbor I
J doubt whether our people as a
whole realize the beauty and fertility
of Porto Rico and the progress that
hs been made under its admirable
pvernment We have just cause for
pride in the character of our repre
5 italives who have administered the
tropic Islands which came under our
fin ns a result of the war with Spain
nd of no one of them is this more
tnio than Porto Rico It would be 1m
possible to wish a more faithful a
mere efficient and a more disinterest
ed public service than that now being
rendered in the island of Porto Rico
by those in control of the insular gov
ernment I
Work of Education 1
I stopped at a dozen towns all told
and one of the notable features in
every town was the gathering of the
school children The work that has
IKHII done in Porto Rico for educa
tion has been noteworthy The main
fmplwsis as Is eminently wise and
proper has been put upon primary
Plication but in addition to this
lli Â° rc is normal school
a an agricul
tural school three industrial and three
hlh schools Every effort is being
mado to securo not pnly the benefits
or elementary education to all the
Porto Ricans of the next generation
hut also as far as means will permit
10 train them so that the industrial
Rsrleultural and commercial oppor
tunities of the island can be utilized
to the best possible advantage It
t evident at a glance that the teach
fc both Americans and native Por
o Ricans were devoted to their work
ook the greatest pride In it and were
endeavoring to train their pupils not
nnly in mind but In what counts for
far more than mind in citizenship that
Is in character
It was very much struck by the ex
cellent character both of the insular
police and of the Porto Rican regi
ment They are both of them bodies
that reflect credit upon the American
a of the Island The In
nhr police are under the local Porto
RIcan government The Porto Rican
raiment of troops must be approprl
aM for by the Congress I earnest
ly hope that this body will be kept
Permanent There should certainly be
troops In the island and it is wise
in these troons should be themselves
mMve Porto RIcans It would be from
rnrr standpoint a mistake not to
Qwtllatc this regiment
Exports and Imports
In traversing the island even
np most cursory survey leaves the
Mioldcr struck with the evident
ttrM growth In the culture both of the
Fr T cane and tobacco The fruit In
v fry is also growing Last year
the most prosperous year that
tc islnnd has ever known before or

trt M or cxoorts and imnorts of the

I An Historic Day
Paris Dec 1TiiIa is an historic
day for France The struggle which
began In 1880 with the banishment of
the Jesuits ded today with the legal
rupture of the bond which for prac
tically a thousand uninterrupted years
had united church and tate By re
fusing to make the required declara
tions under the public meeting law of 1
1881 publlcCatholic worship xcept
by schismatic organizations tomor
I row becomes Illegal I
The scenes in some of the churches II
I I were extremely touching Not In
years had there been such an attend
I ance at mass The number of women I
was especially large and was note
worthy as Indicatingthe religious in
I difference of the male population Al
though seveneights of theinhabitants
of this city are nominally Catholics
in no part of the city were the I
I churches crowded Even at Notre
Dame cathedral where a solemn high
mass was celebrated the edifice was
only half fiI1 dlhe officiating clergy
read the regular offices for the week
I as usual without referring to their
illegal status tomorrow
Nevertheles depression of the Catho
lics was manifest Many women
emerged from the cathedral with their
eyes streaming with tears and linger
ed on the pavement to discuss what
to do when the clergy are turned out
of their churches
But on the eve of the struggle it is
becoming more apparent that both the
government officials and higher ec
clesiastics are resisting the advice of
the intemnerate Minister of Public
Worship Briand announces that the
government cannot be driven into the
trap of closing the churches and
Cardinal Richard archbishop of Paris
has strongly censured the placarding
of appeals to the clericals to make
violent resistance to the officers of
the law
No violence he said but passive
resistancerto the unjust law after ex
hausting all protests at every step1t
This is thp disposition so far as the
higher ecclesiastics are concerned but
their followers evidently have no in
tention to submit and are preparing
to assume the roll of martyrs aban
don the churches and organize private
worship

quietly that it was not until yester

that it became known and then only J
among a very few I
A hotel modern and uptodate in
every respect is to occupy the site fil
At least this was the statement made
yesterday afternoon by certain par V
ties and when Mr Jennings was seen
seen regarding the matter he admitted t
the purchase of the property by Mr
Varn and himself and also said that i
it had been secured with the general i
understanding that it would be the 2IJ
site of amodern hotel building 1i
Further than this Mr Jennings did
not care to say The plans he said j
regarding the hotel were in their em I

formation further than to say that the t1
property had been secured for hotel s
purposes iL
An Excellent Site 4 t
The site secured is considered an j
excellent one for a hotel especially
one which is modern and uptodate
in its appointments The lot has a t
frontage of 192 feet on Palafox street 9 b
and also fronts on Wright street the J
same number of feet For a hotel no fr
better site could be secured and that I
the gentlemen mean business is shown
by the fact that they have already in

those who know the parties that un i
