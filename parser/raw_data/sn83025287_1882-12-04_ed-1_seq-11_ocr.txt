Washington, Dec. The president's
message and the report of the secretary of
the treasury were submitted to the cabinet
at yesterday afternoon's session, and care
fully considered. - The main features of
both documents had been discussed at for
mer meetings of the cabinet, so that yes
terday's work was mainly revisory. Last
night they were sent to the printer, who
will be ' held responsible f^r their safe
keeping until the time for their return for
regular transmission to congress on Mon
day next. This secrecy of preparation has
not altogether availed in serving its pur
pose, however, and there is authority for
giving out
A SUMMABX OF THE MESSAGE,
which also includes the important features
of the treasury report. ;U *,% \
The message of last year covered thirty
two pages of a printed pamphlet. The
message of the present year will not cover
more than twenty-four such pages, and it
is probably a column, if not more, less
in newspaper space. The president pre
faces his message with a review of tbe
more important matters which appertain
to our foreign and diplomatic intercourse.
He recites the fact of the passage of the
immigration treaty with China, and an
nounces that under the direction of the
state department, arrangemests have been
effected for carrying its provisions into
operation.
THE SOUTH AMEBICAN TBOUBLES
are treated at length, and comprise
a succinct review of what has been
done by the government in the
direction of an amicable adjustment of
the pending difficulties between the bellig
erents. The mission of Mr. Trescott and
Walker Blame to Peru and Chili is re
caUed, and reference is made to the reports
submitted by them, which were the subject
of full discussion in congress and other
wise, officially, last spring. The apparent
prostration of the effort made by the gov
ernment at that time in the interest of
peace did not discourage further efforts in
the same direction, and the appointment
of Mr. Logan as -minister to the Chilian
government gave assurance that the gov
ernment of the United States was still
desirous, so far as might be
proper and acceptable, to interpose
its good officers. The president ventures
to hope that the apparent obstacles which
have so far confronted our minister to Chili
may eventually be overcome to the credit
of this government and the satisfaction of
the hostile powers. • .
On the subject of the movement for
an •y''?^
INTEBNATIONAL PEACE CONGRESS,
to assemble in Washington city,inaugurat
ed under the administration of his prede
cessor, the president recites the fact of its
interruption by his own order, and states
as his reason for giving such an order,
that upon careful research and earnest re
flection he had been unable to reconcile
the customs that have prevailed in the
diplomacy of this government
with a proposition so far-reaching
in its scope and so doubtful in its effect
and that, since upon congress must de
volve the development and ratification of
such a proceeding, he had felt it incum
bent upon himself, in the interest of pub
lic policy, to transmit all the correspond
ence which bore upon ; the subject as
well as the subject itself, to congress.
The president does not intimate an un
favorable attitude toward the assembling
of such a peace congress, but prefers that
if it shall assemble its character and ob
ject shall have been first the
subject of thoughtful consideration,
and by the representatives -of
the people rather than by the
executive head of the government. In
this connection the president suggested the
advisability of measures looking to a
settlement of international difficulties by
arbitration, which method, he recalls, has
been the subject of profitable discussioa,
satisfying him that the object is well
worthy the attention of congress as a
means of securing prolonged peace. ;
MEXICO.
The president notifies congress that,
pursuant to the confirmation by the sen
ate of the special commissioners nomi
nated by him, arrangements have been
progressing for the commercial treaty with
Mexico, and the departure of the commis
sion will not be long delayed. Mention is
made of several copyright and international
treaties, notably with Spain and Belgium.
AMEBICANS IN EBITISTI JAILS.,
The president treats briefly the matter
of the arrest and imprisonment of Ameri
can citizens in English . jails, reciting the
fact of the arrest and inquiry regarding
them on behalf of tins government, of the
demands made through the state depart
ment and our minister to England for the
prompt trial of- the suspects or their : re
lease, and acknowledges r the reparation
subsequently accorded by the British gov
ernment. The statement is supplemented
by the announcement of the transmission
to congress with the message of volumin
ous correspondence and other papers cov
ering the subject. , jy.y\ '
The president next reviews the opera
tions of

enue applicable to the reduction of the

count of the postoffice department were
$31,836,062.30, and the expenditures $39,
--265,298.43. Of these amounts $20,211,
--991.78, or about one-half, was received and

from $29,521,632.72 to $29,517,275.32.
EXPOBTS AND IMPOSTS.

[were $733,239,732, as against $883,
--925,947 during 1881, a. decrease of
$150,686,216. The value of our exports of
cotton was $199,812,644. The value of
the exports of breadstuff's amounted to
$182,970,528. The imports during the year
amounted to $724,639,574. balance of trade
in our favori n face of our decreased ex
ports aggregated nearly $26,000,000.
SEDUCTION OF TAXATION. v
The president congratulates the country
upon its prosperity, aud favors a rigid
economy in public expenditures and a re
duction of the internal taxes. He endorses
the recommendation of the secretary of
the . treasury that the tax. on distilled
spirits, tobacco and fermented liquors be
reduced to a minimum consistent with
sufficient revenue to meet largely in
part the . ordinary demands of the
government. He favors otherwise the ab
olition of internal taxes, leaving spirits,
tobacco and fermented Uquors to bear the
burden.
BEFUNDING. ,'v:*' r
A considerable portion of the message is
devoted to a report of the operations con
nected with the refunding of the three and
a half per cent, bonds into three per cents.
From the fact that these latter bonds rule
at a premium, the president suggests to
congress that in his opinion the time is
now ripe for legislation which will enable
the secretary of the treasury to further con
tinue to refund the debt. He thinks . the
experience of the year conclusively shows
that the bonds of the nation bearing 3 per
cent, interest can be successfully
placed. He aggregates the amount of
interest it will require to pay the four and
four and a halfs if they remain outstand
ing until maturity, and concludes that
wise statesmanship ought to find out some
means of escape from the burdens of such
heavy drafts upon the treasury on account
of interest. He recommends no specific
plan, but if some portion of the bonds are
hot funded, favors a modification of the
law, so that national banks may in some
way have the advantage of the premium
on such bonds as are held by the United
States treasurer to secure their circulation.
THE TABIFF,
Touching the tariff, the president renews
his recommendation of last year, that
the existing laws need revision.
He expresses the - hope that
the labors and the report of the tariff com
mission may be so enlightened as to facili
tate congress in dealing with the subject.
The president also renews his recommend
ation for the early retirement of the silver
certificates, on the ground that they form
an unnecessary addition to the paper cur
rency, which he thinks can be supplied in
sufficient amounts to meet the demands of
trade by national banks.
GOLD CEBTIFICATES.
An interesting clause of the message is
devoted to the gold certificates. ■ Of the is
sue authorized by the act of July 12,1882,
$138,000,000 has been ordered printed for
issue; up to Nov. 1, $21,790,000 had been
issued, and $14,827,000 are held in the
vaults of the several United States
sub-treasures, leaving actually out
standing $9,862,289. Up to
Nov. 1 last there had been coined un
der the act of Feb. 28, 1878,128,329,880
standard silver dollars, of which $93,006,
--382 remain in the treasury vaults, and
$35,323,498 are in circulation. The presi
dent favors the repeal of the law which
requires a fixed coinage for each month,
and recommends that it be left to the.dis
cretion of the secretary of the treasury..
THE NATIONAL BANKING SYSTEM. '
Alluding to . the national banking sys
tem the president directs attentions to the
fact that up to Oct 31, last, over 170 banks
had been organized, with an authorized
capital of $15,767,300, and to which -there
had been issued circulating notes aggrega
ting over $6,000,000. The total number of
national banks is nearly 2,300. Siaco
the passage -of ; the act ..of congress
authorizing national banking associations
to continue their corporate existence,more
than fifty banks have reorganized.-f,f; 5" ■";
. THE POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT. 'o££t\
In reviewing the report of the postoffice
department,' the president calls the special
attention of congress to the reductions 'in
the cost of the postal service for the '■ last
fiscal year. The star route service it" is
estimated, will cost, for the fiscal year,
$5,500,000, which* is more than $200,000
less than the cost of ■ this service for the
last fiscal year, and $1,730,000 less than
the amount appropriated for the current
year.' He favors the . suggestions'of the
postmaster general fof the establishment
of a postal savings system,
and directs the attention ' of con
gress to numerous . ■ recommendations
calculated to promote efficiency and secure
economy in the postal service. ' For the
next fiscal year the receipts are estimated
in round numbers at $50,000,000 and the
expenses $40,000,000, an : estimated excess
of receipts over expenditures 0fj§4,000,000.
;. THE WAS DjEPABTICENT. vV:'!v
~ That portion of the message which re
THE SaINT PAUL DAILY GLOBE, MONDAY MOKNING, DECEMBER 4, 1882.
lates to the war department is of interest
i chiefly because of the concurrence by the
: president with the views of • the) secretary
1 touching an increase'of the army and ;; the
curtailment of appropriations ;. for «public
works. The president ; advises congress
| that of the amount i appropriated in the
last river and harbor bill, there remains on
hand a large;unexpended.balance, which
could not •be 'yy- .applied 'during
tho year because .of the late day at which
these amounts became ;[ available. \ Pro
ceeding on the theory that taxation is to be
reduced, the president joins with the secre
tary of war in the : hope; that r congress for
the next fiscal year will make no appropri
ations on account of rivers and harbors,
except in so far as ; may be necessary to
prosecute the work already begun, and for
which the appropriations will have been
exhausted at the end of the fiscal year.
• ■ ■• THE NAVY. •' ' ■
The operations of the navy department
are very briefly reviewed. The attention
of congress is invited to the report of the
board of advisors of the navy, and vari
ous recommendations advanced,
to promote its efficiency.
The president concurs with the secretary
of the navy in his recommendations for
placing the navy on a better footing, both
as to ships and armament. - He also in
dorses the recommendation that the rev
enue, marine and life-saving service and
coast survey be transferred from the con
trol of the treasury department .to the
navy department, as a means of combin
ing under a single head all . similar ser
vices. He also states that since the ad
journment of congress a board has been
appointed, which is now engaged in an in
vestigation of the circumstances attending
the loss of the Arctic steamer Jeannette
Also, the appointment of a commission to
inspect the various navy yards now estab
lished and to report upon such as can be
dispensed with without detriment to the
pubUc service. ''}sk*i
INDIAN. AFFAIHS. \
The policy of the secretary of the inte
rior with regard to Indian affairs meets the
president's approval. He urges that such
treatment of the Indians as will tend to
civilize them should be encouraged, and
calls attention to the firm and yet harmon
izing influences which have been thrown
about them during the past year, resulting
in an exceptional season of freedom from
turbulence. The importance of a law to
allow the Indians to hold their lands in
severalty is also urged on the ground that
it would best tend to promote the welfare
, and permanent advancement of the In
dians.
POLYGAMY.
The president congratulates congress
upon the passage at the last session, of a
law for the suppression of polygamy in the
territory of Utah. The commissioners ap
pointed under the law have. been engaged
in their labors in Utah, and have made con
siderable progress. There were and remain,
obstacles of no mean order to be overcome,
which the president hopes may disappear
without occasion for more stringent legis
lation. The failure of the people of that
territory to accept the law in its fuU spirit
was, he says, perhaps to have been expect
ed to some extent because of the radical
change in the elective . system
heretofore prevailing, and the natural
aversion to the law of the great majority
of the people of the territory. He recom
mends the continuance of the commission
until it shall have been demonstrated that
there is no longer practical necessity for
its use.
; 'i.'^iy. y pensions.
The estimates required for the payment
of pensions for the current year is $100,
--000,000. This is an increase over last
year's estimates, accounted for by the ad
judication of a greater number of claims
because of the increased clerical force
authorized at the last session of congress.
THE STAB BOUTB PBOSECUTIONS.
The president recaUs the prosecution of the
star route cases under the de
partment of - justice, announcing
the progress already made
and the determination of the administra
tion to secure a full investigation and a
satisfactory outcome in the courts. He de
clares it to be his purpose, and it' is that
of the department, to obtain only a just
result, and one that will commend itself to
intelligent and fair-minded public opinion.
But the administration wUI not suffer
obstruction at the hands of its own officials,
as has been shown by removals from office
as the penalty of official departures from a
correct course of action. The president
takes care to emphasize the infliction of
these penalties as having been prompted
wholly in a spirit of loyalty to
the reasonable demands of the
government, and he commends the action
of the deportment of justice in this re
spect, referring to the attorney general's
report and correspondence transmitted
from the depratment of justice.
CIVIL SEBVICE BEFOBM.
Nor does the president forget the civil
service. He is still in favor of its eleva
tion, and some plan which will improve it
by reason of a more stable tenure. He is
opposed to removals save for inefficiency,
neglect or malfeasance. He makes no rec
ommendation as to what should be done
to reform it, taking the ground that it is
within the ample jurisdiction of congress.

.4. Lad Drowned While Trying to Save His'
Brother From Death.' '
.On Friday afternoon a sad accident oc
curred on' the Minnesota river near the
railroad bridge opposite Fort Snelling. " A
number of lads were skating on the ice at
that... point, and .while engaged in that
sport became somewhat boisterous. One
of the boys, named Frank Freeman,
snatched tho hat off a companion, and was
making off with it in great glee wheri he
passed the danger line and broke through
the ice. The accident was seen : by his
brother ■ Reese, who was some distance
away, and he at once rushed loathe assist
ance of his younger brother... In his haste
he did not observe that he was passing over
dangerous,.,ice, and before . he was
aware of his danger he broke through and
was completely submerged and drowned.
The attention of the crowd .;-was attracted
entirely by the first accident, and the
breaking in of Reese was not discovered
until it was too . late. His body was re
covered soon after, at the spot where the
ice broke, , but ■ life was . extinct. The
younger brother was saved by the spec
tators, among whom were several men
from the fort.
: When the body of the unfortunate lad was
taken home, his . mother was completely
prostrated. She is in a delicate condition,
arid the she • ':' very nea. ly killed ■ her. .-, SI c

* Chicago, Nov. ; 2.—The meeting of the
presidents and general ■ managers of the
railroads engaged in the war in the North
west, held at the office of ; President j Keep,
of the Chicago & ' Northwestern, :: failed ''to
arrive at any agreement regarding the mat
ters in ; controversy. President Alexander
Mitchell and General Manager S. S. Mer
rill, of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul,
were first to arrive on the scene, and a
short time afterward, President Hugh Rid
dle and Vice President R. R. Cable, of the
Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific came in.
Assistant President E. H. Winter, of the
Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha,
was the next to appear, but President Bax
ter, of the same line, did not join tho party
until the hands of the clock indicated the
hour of 11, the time for which the meeting
was set. ' •"- r
The visitors : were welcomed by Presi
dent ; Keep and Vice President. Marvin
Hughitt, of the Northwestern, and after a
hand shake all around the antagonists re;
tire 1 into the president's room to endeavor
to settle their difficulties.:
The conference lasted from 11 un
til 1 o'clock, arid when f it was"over, Presi
dent Keep informed the Globe represen
tative that nothing decisive had been ar
rived at, and that the meeting had ad
journed to meet at the Windsor hotel,' New
York, Dec 8.
"You may say," said Vice President
Hughitt, "that all the subjects in dispute
were discussed in good temper." j s J'.'*
It was evident from the expression of
perplexity and| dissatisfaction on Presi
dent Keep's face that the outconre of his
little plan to restore peace or patch up a
truce was anything but what he hid hoped
it would be.. vt :^3:
In a general way it was learned that
President Porter of the Omaha]) Une, was
fixed and immovable in the position he
has taken, which is that the Milwaukee &
St. Paul people must relinquish the ag
gressive poUcy of extending their line and
building new roads into the territory of
other, roads, where such , new roads j are
not required, before he will consent to a
cessation of the present war.
President Mitchell, of the Chicago, Mil
waukee & St. Paul, defends the right of
his company to build new roads wherever
they were wanted" by the people, and de
clined to made - any concessions in this
respect. '~ '-;":; "•
President j Keep, in calling the meeting,
evidently thoight that the question of the
division or theJNorthwestern business was
the principal thing to be settled, but Presi
dent Porter's statement of bis position has
changed the situation entirely, and the
prospects of an early adjustment of the
troubles are exceedingly gloomy.
Messrs. Riddle and Cable, representing
the Bock Island and the Minneapolis
roads, were of course ready to enter a new
pool, provided it was agreed that*|their in
terests should have an equal share of the
earnings, but the new phase of the war put
the consideration of their proposition out
of the question for the present. ;;->.-
President Porter was the' first to leave
the meeting, and was foUowed by Messrs.
Riddle and Cable. Messrs. Mitchell and
MerrUl remained in j conference with
Messrs. Keep and Hughitt for five or ten
minutes longer. It was reported that
President Porter had lost control of the
Omaha line, and had taken his present
attitude in order to prolong the war and
depress the stock market and regain his
hold on the road.
SUNDAY OBSERVANCE.
The Law to be Enforced in New York-
Sunday Papers to be Suppressed, Barber
Shops and Bath Booms to be Closed, and
. Driving in the Parks to be Stopped.
New Yobk, Dec. 2.The new code, so far
as it refers to to the observance of Sun
day, will be enforced by the police to
morrow. Superintendent Walling in con
versation said: "I do not think it a work
of necessity that newspapers should be sold
Sunday or that men should work Sunday
to get up Monday's papers. That is service,
labor and a misdemeanor, and the police
will be liable for misdemeanor if they do
not stop it. Then the barber shops will un
questionably be closed, because men can
get shaved on Saturday. Bathing establish
ments are also not works of necessity or
charity. We do not have jurisdiction over
Central park, but if the park policemen do
their duty Sunday driving will be stopped.
We shall stop driving on Seventh avenue
and tbe boulevard. If the men do not ar
rest every one they can have no possible
excuse to give the police commissioners
for not doing their duty.,' -
Corporation Counsel Andrew gave an
opinion this afternoon to the police com
missioners in regard to the penal code.
He says in regard to the sections referred
to by the commissioners, forbidding all
manner of servile labor, except in works of
necessity or charity, that the duty of the
board is precisely the same in that respect
a3 in regard to the enforcement of the
criminal statutes. He does not recommend
indiscriminate arrests, but recommends
the police, in case of doubt, to apply to a
magistrvte for a warrant. -He says of
course all sports, pastimes, excursions and
shows should be prevented, and " also the
selling of all commodities, with the excep
tion allowed by the statute. The police
have notified the trades people who : have
heretofore kept open on Sunday that they
must close hereafter, or submit to arrest.
: The police commissioners have,'decided
that the running of sur^ce and elevated
roads, ferry boats, and the delivery of > ice
cream and newspapers are \ not violations
of the . penal!; .'cdo and an order to that
effect is issued. i
OFFICIAL CLASHING.
Two Officers Draw Revolvers in Disputing
'--..•■-;-;;./ fora' Prisoner. .
Yesterday morning Officer Moriarity set
out for Ft. Snelling, having in custody the
deserter Quigley. Upon reaching Mendota
the officer was approached by a bulldozing
constable of that place, who attempted to
take Quigley away from- him. The \ brief
i authority ; man. sought to show his im
portance, and actually drew a revolver, but
Moriarity was not to be scared, arid,, he
gave"the interloper to understand-: that he
would not be ' trifled. with. -. He brought
Quigley back and took him up by way :of
the Fort road. . ;''""
There was a reward of - §30 offered for
the deserter, \ and ; this i prompted" the Da-'
kota man to make this bad break, the fact
being that Quigley was arrested in St. Paul
by Officer Moriarity. :Ip order"to riot sur
render his man the officer was compelled
to: fire his ; revolver ;in the air,' which so
frightened the {Dogberry that he beat a
hasty retreat. Hereafter he wiU probably
not interfere with ■ St. '.. Paul '• officers in the

.- phatic denial came from the officers of the coin

. false was that an injunction was, to bo obtained
against the Western Union Telegraph company's ]
forthcoming dividend, but this was ' squelched
when it became known that Gould would repeat I
a maneuver practiced • with ~ great ". success and
; cash the dividend '', himself. The Gould people
i are still very ; feverish on \ Western Union Tele
, graph and claim that by next July the net earn- I
ings will be at least $7,000,000 and that the com
, pany is now earning 11 per cent, on the market
value of the stock. The general features which
• have influenced the stock market , for the last
two business days in the direction of lower
prices are still . predominant. They are the : ail
road war and the uncertainty about when it wil
bo ended. ! The news from Chicago that' the rail
road officials could not agree in the meeting to
day and adjourned to meet in New York Decem
ber 8, has increased the doubtful feeling as to

New Yoke, Dec. 2.1t is said that the
Michigan Central capital is to be increased
from $18,000,000 to $20,000,000, and a
scrip dividend of 20 per cent., besides 2
per cent, in cash paid to stochholders at
the end of the year. The Canada Southern
lease is said to have been unanimously
ratified.
Many operators think an easy money
market should start a big boom in prices.
It is said that a great influential pressure
has been brought to bear upon the mana
gers of Northwestern and Southwestern
railroads to induce a settlement of the
troubles to-day. Big men i are said to be •
on the way to Chicago to lend a voice to
wards harmony. It is said the
fhcht cannot possibly last over the middle ,
of December. -
A great many people seem to be specu :
latiiig for a January rise.' It is stated that
Erie will pay quarterly dividends next
year on prererred stock. Jersey central
is said to ">e negotiating with an English
syndicate for the sale of a large portion of
its dock property in Jersey City, and that ,
the receipts from •the sale will enable it to
remove the, receiver. The reported sale of yS
3,000,000 acres of Northern Pacific lands is ; .
not believed by well informed parties in/.*'

Messrs. Winslow, Lancir & C0.,0n behalf
of a syndicate of European and American '
bankers which they have organized, have
concluded their negotiations for the pur- j
chase of a large amount of first • mortgage
bonds of New York* Watertown & Buffalo ;.
railroad, by which $15,000,000 cash is .to
be furnished for the completion of this y
railway with ample ,-■ equipments
and terminal facilities, besides
interest requirements. The bonds have
been taken at an average of .4 per cost, ,"
arid accrued interest payable •in install
ments as wanted fo^ construction. By
this and the previous sales of bonds at par | '
the company will realize an 1 average of
about 90 per cent, for the entire issue of '
•bonds. The officials of this road announce ..
that this line is expected to^be ready fore
traffic over the first division by Feb. 1, and :
'to Albany and Syracuse; about thirty days |
later, and for through trunk line business',
to Buffalo Aug. 1. : "-' • -;"■;.-. .• .:

stocks had \ :': been secured '■;-: to-day, the :.o
chances for a truca are much better than 
