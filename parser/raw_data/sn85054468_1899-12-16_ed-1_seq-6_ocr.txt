By J. R. MASON, President.
SATURDAY, DECEMBER 10. 1S99.
The Senate's Firm Hand.
With feelings of intense satisfaction, wc
offer our congratulations to the United
State Senate on Its action in thus early
is the session putting its foot, with crush
ing force upon the first effort on the
part of the Hoar, Most, Schurz, and At
kinson Filipino dement to afford legis
lative encouragement to rebels in arms
against the United States We are glad
to observe that the Pettigrew resolution,
'which, in the form of an enquiry, sought
to establish the groundless charge that
the flag of the "Filipino Republic" has
ever been recognized by the authorities
or agents of this country, was summarily
and contemptuously laid on the Senate
table, where all such things in future
.should be sent hilaritar et celeriter with
apologies to a decent article of official fur
niture which has often felt the weight
0f meritorious and patriotic measures.
"While we are about It, we may as well
remark that the thanks of the whole
eouatry. and particularly of all honest
Democratic voters, are due to Senators
Uaeeay. McEnery, and McLaurin for their
good taste as well as their Americanism
in declining to be drawn into a Filipino
irao under the leadership of a Pettigrew.
What may be the emotions of the alleged
Democrats who voted in support of a reso
lution which meant nothing but adoption
by the Senate of slanders against worthy
American officers long since proved to he
falee and outrageous we are not sufli
oieBtly In their confidence to know. Such
as they are, they are probably satisfactory
to the individuals alluded to; but if they
are of an exuberant character, it must be
because those who experience them are
rstte ignorant of the existence of an
American public as patriotic as it !s nu
merous. , When we eoroe to analyse the vote by
which the Pettigrew fling at the flag
was consigned (o the waste-basket. It be
eostes evident that the event amounted to
one of those Joint pedo-Democratlc, Pop
wlisttc. and Aguinaldo defeats of which the
November elections furnished such an apt
illustration. In the list of banner-iearers
It is uite natural that we should find the
name of Hoar, who, in 3SS5, with his long,
Sat foot planted oa the ooee of Plymouth
Rock, predicted that the day would soon
some when New England roots would
work along the bed of the Pacific Ocean
jBd spring up in imperial glory on the
other side. Verily, he has bis reward!
,lt is equally natural that the paradox of
sugar combined with Populism as repre
sented by the amazing Pettigrew should
appear on the roster. "We are less gratified
4 note in the roll of humiliation the
names of men who formerly stood for the
seed old political faith and doctrine of
IVasbiagtoe, Jefferson, Jackson, and Polk,
none of whom. K alive today, would have
been found throwing mud at our national
CJaStgn.
Capital Pnnlshinent.
At frequent intervals some criticism or
proposed innovation arouses the medical
world and the followers of jurisprudence
to a new discussion of the most desirable
Method of inflicting capital punishment
A Xew York lawyer declared recently at a
professional society meeting that the elec
tric chair, which is the legal In&trument
f death in the Empire State, is inhuman
and barbarous, and be supplemented his de
wmdatkm by the startling prediction that
the guillotine would yet be substituted as
the machine for ridding the Commonwealth
of those persons who had been sentenced
to the extreme penalty for the commission
of capital crimes.
Almost coincident with this radical
opinion a proposition was made in Ohio to
produce the death of the condemned by the
Inhalation of hydrocyanic acid fumes,
which, it is elaimed, will extinguish the
tpark of life painlestly and almost instan
taneously. This method is advocated by an
eminent Ohio chemist, but Is opposed by a
member of the board of penitentiary man
agers, who asserts that electricity is the
only scientific agent for the purpose in
Question.
It 16 plain that the argument concerning
the relative value of devices for execu
tioners will prove a bone of contention
-both with experts and laymen until the ad
vent of the millennium, assuming that
pnWle opinion continues to maintain tho
necessity of capital punishment. But as
4o the painlessness of the several 'methods
as a comparison of their superiority or
Inferiority from a humane standpoint, man
kind must ever remain in an indefinite
state of mind. The absolute lack of infor
mation concerning the physical sensations
experienced by the victim of his own evil
deeds precludes the formation of an exact
opinion on the subject in controversy.
Most of the knowledge bearing upon these
points is necessarily theoretical, and the
disagreement of scientists, penaloglsts, and
sociologists accentuates the fact that their
conclusions are largely founded upon a
hypothetical basis.
Th6 gallows, therefore, has as many de
fenders, when it comes to considering tho
efficacy of the machine and discarding all
juwtimentai considerations,- as the electric
. chair. Many criminologists are guflkiently
liberal to declare that It is not so much a
metier of selecting a device a It is proper
use of the apparatus on scientific princi
ples. They' contend that, carelessly used,
any appliance, now or old, for the tloBtruc
tfcw of capital offenders, wJft fall to pro
duce death with the desirable minimum of
physical pain and the maximum of speed.
-Xhe KcsaiClL Gibraltar Tunnel.
On its Jape the scheme of M. Jean Bcr
lier, the eminent 'French englneor, to tun
nel the Straits of Gibraltar from Spain to
.Morocco Jooks like a merely commercial
firoject which if accomplished would add
materially to the transportation facilities
between Europe and the north coast of Af
rica. It is so treated, as far as we are able
to learn in Paris, where the matter is re
ceiving much and distinguished attention.
It happens, however, that while the idea
appears to be entirely feasible from an en
gineering viewpoint, its cost being esti
mated at a figure within reason, and the
investment promising a fair return on the
necessary capital, it involves a political
question the appearance of which has been
long dreaded by the powers of Europe, as
one almost certain at some future time to
lead to war. In other words, the construc
tion of the intercontinental tunnel referred
to would open up the question of the po
litical control of the Sultanate of Morocco,
a State which is on the point of disintegra
tion and the territory of which is yearned
for by more than one nation.
As Morocco is just across the strait
from Gibraltar its possession by any strong
military power would render England's
control of the Mediterranean entrance a
nullity. Hence England will not, without
a fight, permit a rival to occupy it, or at
least its Mediterranean littoral. Germany
considers that tho possession of .Morocco
by another would be injurious to her in
terests in Africa and calculated to prevent
the rounding out of German colonial ter
ritory in that continent. Germany and
England could easily reach a satisfactory
division settlement between them, and
that, it is believed, was one of the impor
tant state affairs discussed by the Em
peror and his Foreign Minister, with Mr.
Chamberlain, during tho recent visit to
Queen Victoria.
But France and Spain have been finessing
together to get control of Morocco for
themselves. Spain, with French money,
has been busily fortifying the heights op
posite Gibraltar, and France has been pre
paring at the first favorable opportunity to
push her Algerian frontier westward. In
diplomatic circles it has been buspected
that Russia has secretly encouraged this
Franco-Spanish movement, and might back
it with arms when the time should come
for action. Should France, for instance,
formally adopt the tunnel project, to which
it Is reported Spain already has acceded,
the question would at once assume political
importance and would certainly precipi
tate a strained diplomatic situation in Eu
rope which might shortly end in a general
conflagration.
Some little time ago we ventured to sug
gest that the first serious British reverse in
South Africa might be the signal for re
newed and serious international movements
menacing to Great Britain's imperial in
terests. The springing into public atten
tion of this tunnel proposition may mean
most interesting developments.
SJniis of Ynletlde.
A curious burlybufly of business and
sentiment, of eager shoppers and active
merchants, of jostling, good-natured
throngs' with heavy bundles and lighter
purses, of calculating mothers, obedient
fathers, and expectant youngsters, indicate
that the Yuletide draws near. And the
spirit of the Christmas season: is one quite
irresistible. Tho busy man who can manage
to escape all other holidays barring the
Fourth of July, perhaps resigns himself
to the temporary service of Santa Claus,
und with excellent grace permits himself
to be piloted through the mazes of the
brilliantly bedecked shops.
To the average woman, skilled in the tac
tics of storming the bargain counter and
artfully securing her share of the spoil, the
present animated rivalry of trade is a
source of delight; but to the average man,
with his head full of problems, personal,
political, and professional, it cannot be set
down as an occasion of unadulterated joy.
To him the mysteries and intricacies of
the emporium arc as piofound as a chap-
ter of Sanskrit, and, readily admitting
that if a bargain and a bucksaw were
placed side by side, he could scarcely
distinguish between them, ho follows
in the family train with mingled emo
tions. Not that there Is a paucity of
holiday cheer In bis soul, but ho realizes
his unsophisticated condition and imagines
that he feels much as he would at a quilt-iag-boe
or an executive session of a
woman's debating society. Women are
born shoppers; it is almost a second nature
with them, like following the fashions in
gowns and hats, but there are so few mem.
bers of the genus homo who can appreciate
tho "reduced-from-tbree-dollars-to-two-ninety-eigLi"
sign that they are not
worth considering unless it be as exceptions
to prove the rule that the sex is not a bargain-hunting
one.
So it transpires- as .fihristmas comes
apace, the courageous citizen determines to
discard his misgivings, assume an appear
ance of unconcern and go bravely forth,
as would a good soldier to do his duty;
this being a Eeaeon of self-gacriflce, he
heroically takes his share. And as custodian
of the reserve fund, he is often an indis
pensable personage, for frequently, when
the expenditure has passed beyond the es
timates, he comes to the fore and prevents
a sudden cessation of trading operations
which, had he been absent, would have
been caused by an unexpected financial em
barrassment. A man wandering aimlessly through a de
partment store, and realizing that he has
no business connection with the establish
ment, has a constant feeling of being in
everybody's way, including his own, and,
though men are not unusual sights in the
empoiiums, they cannot help realizing that
they look as they feel. Nonchalance is an
impossibility, however determined tho ef
fort to appear unconcerned.
However, Christmas comes but once a
year, and when, on the morning of De
cember 25, the splendid array of gifts
greets his eye and the children's tree
sparkles with tinsel and hangs heavy with
Its crop of toys and candy, paterfamilias
will mentally compliment his excellent
judgment ns a buyer and feel convinced
that his presence on the shopping tour had
much to do with making the affair a glit
tering success.
Tlie Persecution of Heroes.
It Is becoming more and more evident
that ne of the things most needed just
at present Is a society for the protection
of heroes. The profession is a dangerous
one at best, but it is not necessary to add
the terrors of peace to tho&e of war. Any
self-rospecting hero Is willing to bravo
shot, shell, flood, and fire in the course
of. doing his duty, but after ho has pur
sued this course to the end and taken his
degree, it seems as if he might be let alone.
Instead of that he is persecuted by his
grateful fellow countrymen. " ''
First, there was Hobson, whose fame was
reduced to a vanishing point by the be
havior of Injudicious feminine admirers.
Then came the Sampson-Schley scandal,
and the deliberate attempt to blacken the
reputationpf the victor of Santiago. Then
Admiral Dewey was abused in terms unfit
for repetition" because he followed the ex--ample
ofa few millions of his less illus
trious fellow citizens, and gave his house
to his wife "And now it Is reported that
earnest but misguided persons are desirous
of turning tho Admiral's back yard into
a menagerie by presenting him with black
bears and other variegated and unusual
live stock. , . w -
This thing will have to stop somewhere.
Suppose that the generosity of the nation
should result in further visitations upon
the victor of Manila? Some enthusiast
may start a scheme to present him with
specimens of the fauna of all America. He
may wake .up some fine morning to find
attached to his door knob a catamount
from Oregon, a wolverine from Michigan,
a grizzly- from Nevada, a moose from
Maine, a coyote from Colorado, a puma
from Arizona, eagles, raccoons, opossums,
elk, buffalo, and other beasts from other
States. Then, .of course, there would be
crabs and tarantulas from the West Indies,
and lizards and peculiar reptiles from the
Philippines, and the collection, while in
teresting, would be hardly the sort of
ornament which a quiet gentleman would
choose for his private residence. In addi
tion to nil this would be the risk of giving
away any or all of his inconvenient ac
quisitions, though the zoological gardens
would be gla'tr enough to get them, and ho
might not have the money or time to sup
ply their wants properly. If he did this
he would be giving away "the gift of the
nation," nnd that could not be thought
of for an instant
It is said that the animal colony at
Rock Creek has received several important
additions from the White House during re
cent years, for when a President received
two or three eagles or a dozen raccoons he
sent them to this appropriate and comfort
able home. Doubtless the bears and other
live stock presented to Admiral Bcvey
could be disposed of quietly in the same
way, and the givers need not know about
it. If it Is a real comfort to any proud
American, In far-away Wisconsin, to think
that a pet bear which he has brought up
from infancy is gamboling around the
parlors of the Admiral's Washington house,
he may as well have that happiness. But
it should be distinctly understood that this
sort of thing has a limit, and that the Ad
miral ought not to be expected to pay ex
press charges on animals which he does not
want. After the recent election several
heavy boxes are said to have come to
President McKinley with heavy express
charges still due on them.
Mr. Pecksniff, in presenting the beauties j
of Salisbury Cathedral, was not happier
than Senator Depew when yesterday l'o
depicted the glories of New York as a
convention town. "No city in the world,"
he said, "is so situated for recreation.
We have the Hudson River on the one
side, the East River on the other side,
and a beautiful bay for excursions." The
eloquent Senator also remarked that tho
"most attractive places in the world are
on the beach." which, meaning Conoy
Island, is doubtless true. There the
thirsty traveler may for a single gold
standard nickel of the realm behold a
quarter of a glass of froth, and for a
ouarter secure six of the famous sand end
leather clams of the period. Most of the
hotels to which the Senator so feelingly
alluded are within two minutes' easy
walk of the Tenderloin, and the police
are totally blind when conventions are in
progress. But we will not enlarge on this
consideration, because Reworks as much to
the benefit of thieves and bunco men and
Danel games as to delegates.
It is understood that, as a rasult of con
ferences held yesterday Mr. Hanna will
oppose the Payne movement to dispense
with the Southern rotten borough repre
sentation in Republican National Conven
tions. We have always expected that he
would take this course. Any other on
his part would be evidence of the rankest
ingratitude.
The war in Kentucky after falling to
materialize on the "dark and bloody
ground," shows some slight signs of break
ing out in Washington, a consummation
devoutly to be deplored. The row between
the factions was bad enough at home. Let
us, in the spirit of love, admonish our
Kentucky brethren not to import it to the
National Capital.
QUAY BEADY TO TIGHT.
Tin-
Former Pennsylvania Srnittor
Arrit es From Florida.
Former Senator Matthew S. Quay arrived
in W.'ishington yesterday from Florida and
went to his K Street residence, where he
was at once visited by Senator Penrose and
one or two other friends interested in hiB
contest for the seat in the Senate. Mr.
Quay was told by these gentlemen yester
day what he knew already by telegraph
and otherwise that bis chances for being
seated were small.
Tho case will be argued before the Com
mittee on Privileges and Elections today,
St having been arranged to devote four
hours to it. The time is to be equally di
vided between Attorney General John El
kins, Mr. Quay's counsel, and former Sen
ator Edmunds, who represents his oppo
nents. Mr. Quay is to ha'e the opening
and closing time. The committee, it is
said, is against Quay. It is composed of
five Republicans, Messrs. Chandler (Chair
man), Hoar, Burrows, Pritchard, McComas,
and four Democrats, Messrs. Caffcry, Har
ris, Pettus, and Turlcy.
The four Democrats and Mr. Burrows will
vote against Quay, and the four Republi
cans remaining will submit a minority re
port in favor of his right to n seat. Th.s
whole matter will probably go over until
after the holiday recess. The leaders on
both sides of the chamber admit that as
tho case stands now Mr. Quay is beaten and
that if a vote were takem today he would
not get more than thirty votes. Some of
the Republican Senators thiuk it posslblo
that after carefully canvassing the situation
during the holiday recess Mr. Quay will, if
he finds a majority agalnBt him, abandon
the contest. v "

Mr. "Woodruff of New York. Timothy
L. Woodruff, Lieutenant Governor of New
York, moved around energetically, but
noiselessly, among the chattering crowds of
Republican leaders gathered at the Arling
ton. It was unanimously decided that the
Honorable Timothy would adorn the Vice
Presidential chair, and it was settled that
he is the handsomest New Yorker who has
been in Washington In many a day. Why
he has been dubbed the "gaudy vest"
statesman by tho ribald press of the me
tropolis was a question that puzzled all be
holders. For surely no gentleman in the
throng was dressed more modestly than he.
His vest was of solemn black, in keeping
with his other tartorini ndornments.
Mr. Woodruff was questioned by a Times
reporter relative to his Vice Presidential
ambition and also as to the reported deal
between him and Senator Piatt, whereby
it is reported Mr. Root is to be shelved
and Governor Roosevelt forced Into the
second place on the ticket with Mr. Mc
Kinley in the interest of peace and har
mony in New York.
"Tho alleged deal is news to me," naively
replied Mr. Woodruff. "I should say that
the report belongs to that category of
things aptly described as interesting it
true. As to my candidacy for Vice Presi
dent, of course, I cannot speak or that now.
This Is neither the time nor place to talk
on such subjects. Nobody yet appears to
be thinking about who is to be President
McKinley's running mate. There is plenty
of time for the Republican party to de
liberate upon this theme and arrive at a
correct conclusion."

Senator Daniel has a proposition which he
will endeavor to have Congress adopt. It
Is that the nation shall purchase the Tem
ple farm, at Yorktown, Va., the land upon
which Lord Cornwallis surrendered to
General Washington. On this farm stands
the old Moore manor, in which the terms
of surrender were agreed upon, and which
f-erved as the headquarters of Washington,
Lafayette, and Rochambeau. The Legis

NEBRASKANS IN DOUBT.
Allen's Appointment to United States
Senate Questioned.
OMAHA, Neb., Dec. 15. "Although I
have not looked up the point recently,"
said Judge Woolworth, President of the Na
tional Bar Association, today, "it is my
opinion that Hayward was not a Senator
at the time .of his death. Since he had
noc duly taken the oath of office the status
is the same as if he had never been elected.
The vacancy would, therefore, date from the
last session of the Legislature, and there
is doubc whether the Governor has the
power to appoint the Senator."
Now the Republican managers sej a hope
of sending one of their number through a
special session of the Legislature, and the
wires over the State and to Washington
are being kept warm in discussing the
question.
Woolworth's opinion, along with that of
a number of other eminent legal lights,
was brought out by a local Republican
organ nnd the majority favored the idea
that the law did not conceive of the Gov
ernor exercising the appointive power un
der such circumstances. The same paper
quotes Judge Hayward, who said during his
last illness that he had never qualified, and,
therefore, was not a Senator, and that his
successor could not be appointed, but must
be elected.
Tonight tho Republican managers are in
session, in Omaha and Lincoln. Their plan
Is to have the Republican Congressional
steering committee prevent the recognition
of Senator Allen if the law favors their po
sition and then force Governor Poynter
to call a special sasslon of Legislature.
This will b'e most difficult. n3ver.
Tho precedent in Nebraska is that the
Governor, If not' superior to the Supreme
Court, Is. at least, co-ordinate in his powers

Court's righ tq rule, but Governor Holcomb

THE PRESIDENT CONDEMNED.
Civil Service lteforiu Lengne Scores
the Administration.
INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. 15. Tho meeting
of the National Civil Service Reform
League -came very near breaking up in a
row today, -whdn tho body met in secret
session to hear the report of the Commit
tee on Resolutions. In view of the bitter
ness which some of the speakers had
shown 'toward the "President and his ad
visers regarding the order withdrawing
places from the classified service, it was
expected that the committee would fol
low a similar bent and report soms sting
ing resolutions. . This proved to be the case,
and loud arid strenuous opposition to the
report was expressed.
It was argued that, while It -might be
true that the President had acted as
charged, it was also true that such strong
language as the resolutions contained
would show too much feeling on the part
of tho league and thus give it a partisan
character, and that it would be best to
moderate the expressions and eliminate- all
evidences of rancor.
Others opposed this view and declared
that there was no language too strong in
which to tell the truth, and that the reso
lutions ought ro"Stjnd as reported. The
debate increased in .heat and a compromise
was reached by ordcrTag the committee to
retire and redraft certain parts of its re
port, which was 'done.
The resolutions, as adopted finally, reffr
to the .withdrawing of several thousand
places from tho classified service as the
first backward ' step taken by a Federal
Administration since t,ho Civil Service law
was adopted, and that the injurious effects
have already become apparent In wide
spread distrust ot the President and the
party in power, In encouraging the ene
mies of reform to attempt still further to
cripple the service, and in the demoraliza
tion of many parts of the public service.
The resolutions further deplore the fact
that the Census Bureau has not been put
under civil service rules, as the party in
power promised to do, and express the be
lief that this fact will lead to extravagance
and inefficiency, as in the last census, in
the diminished value of the census so
taken, and in the lack of public confidence
in its accuracy and impartiality.
In respect to the abuses of the Ind.'an
service the resolutions are as follows:
"The inefficiency and the recurrence of
scandals in the Indian service cannot be
removed except by withdrawing the office
of Indian agent from the sphere of Con
gressional patronage. Although the appoint
ment of such agent is subject to confirm
ation by the Senate, the President has
full power to devise for his own guidance
a suitable system of competitive examina
tions and promotions for such places. The
clerical force of the Indian Service itself
would supply many excellent men for the
higher post of Indian agent, and from the
ranks of agents the inspectorships might
often be filled.
"The restoration of all the places in that
branch of the service excepted from clas
sification by the recent order Is especial
ly necessary to the public Interest. It
cannot be too often repeated that the spoils
system has proved the bane of the Indian
Service."
MACRUM'S VAGUE DESPATCH.
Ills
Telegram to the Slate Depart
ment of Iiittle Value.
In a telegram received by the State De
partment yesterday from United States
Consul Macrura, at Pretoria, South Africa,
he says that he had been informed by the
Transvaal Government that full reports on
all subjects would bo given through tho
War Office of the Republic when applied
for. No mention was made in Mr. Ma
crura's despatch about the action by the
Boers on his request that he be per
mitted to' distribute money to tho British
prisoners. of war with which to buy deli
cacies".' and it is presumed here that the
Transvaal authorities limited their con
cessions to the permission mentioned in
Mr. Macrum's message. Mr. Macrum said
that the concession was granted in teply
to a request of the British Minister of
War. which may or may not mean that the
Boors are not willing to recognize Mr.
Macrum's status as the representative of
British interests during the period of the
war.
The Transvaal Government took its own
time in answering the representatiojs of
this Government for a removal of the re
strictions placed on Mr. Macrum In his
intercourse with the British prisoners.
After the capture of the oillcers and men
of the Royal Irish Fusiliers' and the Lan
cers tho British Government asked him,
through the State Department, to send a
weekly list of the condition of sick nnd
wounded British prisoners and to distribute
among them money with which to buy to
bacco and other things that would make
their condition less hard to bear. When
Mr. Macrum proffered the request it vas
refused on the ground that the care of
Driscners was purely a military matter,
with which Mr. Macrum had no concern.
Mr. Macrum was then directed by the
State Department to represent that the
ruling of the Boers was contrary to prac
tice in civilized warfare. He so informed
the Transvaal authorities a fortnight ago,
and nothing was heard of the matter here
until the receipt of Mr. Macrum's despatch
vesterday. It Is supposed that on the ar
rival at Pretoria of Stanley Hollis. who
will relieve Mr. Macrum temporarily of
Consular dutie3, he will be Instructed to
pre?s for permission to distribute delicacies
to the British prisoners of war.
KINSLEY CROSS-EXAMINED.
IlaiMltvrltiiif? Expert In MoIIiicua.
Trial Makes Admissions.
NEW YORK, Dec. 15. The second week
of the trial of Roland B. Mollneux, accused
of the murder of Mrs. Katherine J. Adams,
closed today with a more or less dramatic
scene. William Kinsley, the handwriting
expert, who has been employed by the
police and the district attorney since the
murder of Mrs. Adams, had testified over
and over again that he had not formed
the positive opinion that Molineux had
written the address on the tfolson pack
age until after he had seen Mollneux write
in his office on February 20, although since
January 1 he had been- muklng examina
tions of specimens of tho young man's
handwriting.
Mr. Kinsley was under cross-examination.
Bartow S. Weeks, Molineux's coun
sel, at the close of tho week's session drew
the picture of the scene in Kinsley's office
on February 20, when Molineux was taken
there to write. He emphasized the fact
that Mr. Kinsley had not been convinced
before February 20. "And it was not," he
said, "until you saw him write in the place
you provided, with the pens, ink, and paper
that you provided, the words that you de
manded written, that you were able to sat
isfy yourself?"
"That Is true," said Mr. Kinsley
"In other words." said Mr. Week3, "you
were not able to form a satisfactory opinion
until you had set the scene to suit you
self nnd had dressed the performers in
the clothes that you wanted, and directed
the playing as you desired?"
"No: I was not satisfied until then,"
said Mr. Kinsley.
Mr. Weeks closed his examination for
the day right there.
Mr. Kinsley was on the stand all day, and
it was not an altogether pleasant day for
him. He had been interviewed long ago
by a reporter and the interview was now
sprung on him. He had written a letter,
and that was produced. In tho Interview
ho had been quoted as saying that breaks
between letters in the address on the poison
package was a part of the scheme of dis
guise adopted by the alleged murderer.
In his direct examination he had sworn
that these breaks proved one of the char
acteristics of the writer and indicated his
habits. In the letter Mr. Kinsley took an
other expert to task for expressing an
opinion that Mollneux had written' the ad
dress. Ir. Kinsley at that time was of tho
opinion that Mollneux had not written It.
ANNEXATION FOR 0UBA.
I?lanlers Think This to He the Ifttltci!1
States' Purpose.
HAVANA, Dec. 15. The "Nuevo Pate"
says In regard to the message of President
.,, . uvb.cw .msi. n perirecuy
m narmony with other Presidential utter
ances regarding Cuba, which; ntteraaees,
the paper thinks, directly go to prove that
the Intention of the United States u clearly
to annex the islands. The paper says:
"The only difference Is that this message
has been diluted with high-sounding
phrases, which appeal to impressionable
people. These phrases were introduced to
minimize the hli'ierto energetic declara
tions hinting thai annexation was the ulti
mate aim of the United States."
Regarding the meaning ot the word In
dependence the paper says: "President Mc
Kinley, in his message, called the present
postal system in Cuba essentially Independ
( ont. Free Cuba, with President McKinley,
j has a far more comprehensive manning
than the same expression among the Cn-
bans. The attainment of freedom and sta-
uwuy mentioned oy .Mr. .HCKtntey does not
depend so much on the form of government
as on there being really capable citizens
to administer and abide by the laws. This
is yet to be proved."
The "Nuevo Pals" believes that General
Wood is the best man Cuba could have for
Governor-General. It thinks that General
Wood favors independence attar a period
of probation, believing that after a year
of self-government the island will petition
for annexation.
Great preparations are being made to
welcome General Wood on his arrival here.
The veterans' societies and other organiza
tions are particularly prominent In these
preparations.
It is believed here, owing to the fact
that General Wilson has- repeatedly told
tho people that la the event of General
Wood succeeding General Brooke he would
no longer serve as a commander of the
Department of Matanzas and Santa Clara.
'that be intends to resign that command.
Members of the Society of Veterans say
that General Ludlow will succeed General
Wilson, and that Gener.il Chaffee will suc
ceed Genaral Wood in Santiago. They add
that the dual government in Havana is a
source of humiliation to the civil governor
and necessarily causes friction.
The commission appointed by the munic
ipality of Havana to examine Into the pur
chase of furniture reports that It found that
the price paid was excessive. The munici
pality will annul the contracts.
Emil Cassin, who was a bugler with
Roosevelt's Rough Riders, ami who has
been on trial here for shooting a major of
the Cuban army last March, has been found
guilty and sentenced to two years and four
months' ImprlEonment. Caasln was a lieu
tenant of Havana police.
Last spring, while sitting In the, cafe of
the Hotel Inglaterra a row started out
side and he went to separate the com
batants. Tho crowd left with the excep
tion ot the major, who refused to obey
Cassin, who was in citizen's clothes. The
Cuban used threats, whereupon Cassia
showed his shield and threatened to shoot
him unless be immediately surrendered.
The man refused to surrender and Cassin
shot him in the leg.
SOLDIERS COMING HOME.
Troops in Cuba to Return Before
December Closes.
Plans were discussed yesterday for the
bringing home of the soldiers In Cuba
whose return was recently authorized.
They will be- transported -on Government
transports from Manzanillo, Cuba, before
the end of December.
The Quartermaster General is also ar
ranging for the purchase of additional
horses to be sent to the Philippines. Re
cent reports from General Otis show that
the cavalry horses are breaking down un
der the heavy strain caused by the active
mountain campaign, and that hundreds of
them will be total wrecks. They will have
to be replaced by others, and orders have
been issued for the purchase in San Fran
cisco of more horses. A transport will
leave San Francisco this week with fifty
horses and a hundred more will be shipped
next week.
Colonel Patten, who has charge of the
clothing bureau of the Quartermaster Gen
eral's Department, has arranged for the
purchase of 40,000 cots for use In the
Philippines. Some time ago General Otis
requested a few thousand cots for use by
the soldiers in the garrisons around Manila.
They were purchased and sent to General
Otis. In a recent cablegram to the Sec
retary of War General Otis explained that
the use ot cots in all garrisoned towns
would grently reduce sickness among the
troops, and recommended their purchase.
Secretary Root has approved General
Otis' request, and bids have been invited
for the cots.
Another matter under consideration by
the Quartermaster General is a change in
the color of the Chambry shirt now fur
nished to the soldiers. Heretofore it has
been bluish grey. It is desired that all the
troops shall be attired in clothing of khaki
color, and the Chambry shirt will hereafter
be of that color. Three hundred thousand
yards of material for these shirts is to be
purchased.
