THE CONDITION OF CUBA.
It U wiih regret Unit I have again to un
noiince the coiitiiitiiince of the disturbed con
dition of Hie island ol Cuba. No advance to
ward thu pacification of ihu discontented part
ol the population has been made, while the in
sin rv clinu bus gained tin advantages, und ex
hlhlis no mom of the i-leiiienls of Miwer, or of
the prospect of ultimate success than were ex
hibited u year ago. Spain, oil Ilia other hniid,
bus not succeed' d lu lis repression, und the
parties stand uppiin nlly in the sumu lelalive
AitilUiie which they have occupied for a long
time p.tit 'J bis ecu lest has lusted now for
more lli;iu lour years. Were it seen si a dis
tance trout our neighborhood we might be in
different to III iisult, although litimuuliy could
not bu unmoved by many of lis incidents,
wlierefer they might occur. It Is, however,
at outdoor. I cr.nnol doubt lhat Ihu contin
ued mulnienaiice of slavery lu Cuba Is among
lb strongest indueeiiielils lo I lie iDUllnuiilicu
of this s;rtle. A lerriblu w rung is lh.' naturul

In the administration of goveffimsnl lu Cub
could not tail lo silviinco tlsw restoration of

ihut thu present liberal Government ol' Spain
will volunluiily adopt lids view. Thu law of

two years since, bus remuliiud unexecuted. In

Justice and lit sympathy with the other poweri
of Ihu christiau aud civilized world.
- W llblu the past few weeks Hip regulation

bv bon announced, giving evMeuc af tua
siuctrily of iuleutiou of the preaeni govern

have not fulled to' urge thu consideration of

conllnnea bloody and destructive eon

Deply hnpn ssed with Hie convicliou that Ihu
cimltnuanec of slavery Is oneol Hie most act
I e causes of tk coiilhiuance of the unhappy
conclliioii in Cuba, I re;ret lo believe that the
cilir.ens of the United Hialeg, or Ihose claiming
lo lie such, nre large holders in Cuba of what
is there claim, d us properly, bin which fe for
hidiVeintod denounc e, ly the law tA, the
United Stales, They nru thus in di fiance of
the spirit ol our own laws, contributing to the
the continuance of this dislresslug and
sickening contest. Iu my lust annual incssago
I referred to this subject, and I again recom
mend sm h legislation ns nny bu proper to dis
courage American citizens from holding or

THE SOUTH AMERICAN REPUBLIC.
It Is gratifying to announce (hat Ihu rntifl
Cation ol Ihc convention concluded under the
auspices oMhis government, between Spain on
the jne part and the allied Republics of the
Pacific 011 the other, providing for un nrnii
slice, have been exchanged. A copy of tile

thai this may bu followed by a permanent
peace beiween the same parties.
The dill'crcnce which alone time threaten
ed the maintenance ol peace beiween Brazil,
and Ihu Argentine K. -public; il is hoped tire lu
the way of satisfactory adjustment. With
these states, as wiih thu republics of Cenlral
and S.1111I1 America, we couiiniio lo niuiiituiu
the most In. udly r. bilious.
THE VENZUELA DEBT.
regret, however, announce that
the Government 01 Venziiula has made no ful
Iher payments ou account ol Hie uwsrils under
the Convention ol the 23 Hi April, 18litl. That
lb public is understood lo bu now almost ll not
quite iraiiquilizud. It is hoped, therelore, that
it will loose no time iu providing lor the un
paid balances of its debt 10 the United Stales,
w hicli, having orlgiuuted in Injuries lo lis cit

Solemn form knoivii among nanoin, would

JAPAN AND CHINA.
Our treaty relations with Japan remain 1111
cliatigid. All imposing embassy Irom that

being unprovided with powers lor lue signing

however, that Hie interchange of opinions
which took place during their stay in this
country bus led to a mutual appreciation of Hie
interests wuich may bu promoted when the re
vision of the existing treaty shall bu under
taken. In tliis couiKction 1 renew my rccom
nieiidiilioii of one year ago Hint to give im
portance and lo add to thu elllclency of our
diplomaiiu relalions with Japan and China,
uud lo 1 11 rtli 1 r uid ii. retaining thu good opin

How between these n itiotis uud the baliincu ol
the commercial world, 1111 appropriation bu
made lo support ul least four American youths
in each of lliesu countries to serve tit pari nf
the ofllcial family of our Ministers. Our rep

RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONGRESS. THE SUBJECT OF CHEAP TRANSPORTATION.
Tho intention of Congress will bu culled
during its present session to various enter
prises for the more cerluin and cheaper trans
portations of the consinully increasing surplus
ol Hie Western and Southern products lo the
Atlantic seaboard. The subject is 0110 that
will force itself upon Ihu legislative brunch of
the government sooner or later, und I suggest,
Iherelore, that iinmedialo steps lie lakuu to
gain nil uvuihiblu information to Insure un
iquilablo aud Just legislation. Thu route to
connect thu Mississippi valley w ith thu Aliun
de at Charleston, South Curoliim, and Biuiun
null, Georgia, by w uter, by the way of thu
Ohio und Tennessee rivers, und canals nnd
slackwuter navigation to Hie Bivannuh und
uumulgeo rivers, bus been surveyed and report
made by an accomplished cngiuecr, uu otllcer
of thu army. The second and third new
routes will be proposed for tbu consideration
of Congress, namely, by an extension of the
Kunuwtia aud James Kiver Cunul to tho Ohio,
and by the extension of ihu Chesuoeuku und
Ohio Cunul. I am uol prepared 10 recommend
government aid lo these or oilier enterprises
until ll is ciuarly shown Uiui they are notoulv
of uullouul iulcreal but that, wbeu completed,
tuey win oe 01 a yiuuu commensurate with
their cost. That production increases more,
rapidly luau tho means of transportation in
our country bus beuu demonstrated by past
experience; that tbu unprecedented growth lu
population und products ot thu whole country,
will require additional lucililies and cheaper
means lor ihu more bulky articles of commuicu
to reach tide water uud a market, will bu de
manded In the near future, Is cquully demon
strable. . I would therefore suggest either a
couimllteu or commission lo bu authorized to
consider this whole question, aud lo repurt to
Congress ul soiuo fuiuru day, lor its butter
guiUaiicu lu legislating on thu iinnortunl sub
ject. The lailroads of tho country have been
rapidly exteudud during 'tho lusl lew years to
mucl iho growing deinunds of producers, aud
reflect much credit upou the capitalists uud
managers engaged iu Iheir cousirnullou. In
udditiou to these, a project to luciliiule com
merce by the building 01 a ship canal around
Niugara Fulls, on tho United btalea side,
which has been agibiled for many years, will
uu doubt bu culled to your attention this sea
sliu. Looking lo tho groal bit uru of Ihe coun
try, thu increasing demands of commerce, it
might be well, while ou Ibis subject, uolouly
lo have examined and reported upon the vait
uus practical routes for connecting ihe Missis
sippi with tide water ou tho Aliunde, but thu
feasibility or an almost continuous laud locked
navigation front Maine to thu Gull of Mexico.
Such a roulo along our coast would bo of
ltroul value at uU liaies, uud of inestimable
vuluo lo cuso of foreign war. Nature has
provided Uie greater pull of this route, uud Iho
obstacles lo he overcome are easily within the
kill of the eugliieer. 1 have uot yet ulluddu
lo this subject with the view of having auy
lurlher expuudiluro of publio mouey at this
lime thau may be necessary to orouuia aud

POSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT.
The accompanying report of tho ro1mrtT

nine remains 10 uu uccompltsiied by Hie treaty
for some iimu to come, in respect to Ihu reduc

aud lor Ihe incruasuot thusalerics of luu heads

the abolition of Ihu franking privilege, and sue
unreason now for changing my views on Hint
subject. Ii not having beuu luvnrubly remin d
ed uy Congress, however, I now suggest a
modiliulion of that privilege, to c.irrect its
glaring uud costly abuses. 1 would recom
mend, also thu uppoiiitmciit of a commillue on
commission lo l ike into consideration ihu best
muthud, equitable lo priyulu corporations who
have i-ivested their liniu uud Capital in the es
tablishment of telegraph lines now iu opera

Uiui this subject could receive thu proper con
siduruliou during Ihu limits of u short session
of Congress, bill il may bo initialed so thai
lurlher aclion muy bu lair to tho goreriiiuuul
und to private, parlies concerned. There nre
but Ibree lines ol ocean steamers, namely, the
Pacitte Mail Stuuiusliip Company, beiween
Sm Francisco, China and Japan, with pro
vision uindu for suiiil-iuouthly service 'idler
October, 1st, 1873; the United 'Slates and Bra
zil line, monthly, und the Cabtoruiu, New
Zealand und Australian line, monthly, plying
between Hie United Stales and foreign porls,
uud ow ned uud, operated under our flag. 1
earnestly recommend that such lilierul con
iracis lor carrying tho mails bu authorized
with these lines as will insure their cuitiuu
unce. If Hie expediency of extending Ihu uid
ol the government to hues of aieiimeis which
hitherto huvu uot received il, should be deem
ed worthy of Hie consideration of Congress,
political nnd commercial objects niako il ad
visable to buslow such uid 011 a line under our
ting belwcuu Panama aud Ihe Western South
American pons. By this means much trade
uow diverted lo other couulries might bu
br jughl to us, to thu mutual advantage 'of this
country and those lyiug in that quarter of Ihu
cuntineut of America.
THE CARRYING TRADE.
Tho report of thu Secretary ol' ilia Treasury
will show an ularmiiig filling olf in iki r car
rying trade for tiie la.-l leu or twelve years,
und even for thu past year.. I do not bwlievu
that the public treasure c.iu bu butter expend
ed in Hie Intel esis of Ihu whole people, than in
trying 10 recover tills trudo. An expenditure,
ol 5,000,000 peranum for thu next live years,
il il'wotild restore to ns our prop irtlon of the
carrying trudo of Ihu world would be profi
table expanded. Tne prico ol labor id Europu
has s) much enhanced within thu lust lew
years that tho cost of building and operating
ocean sletuiers In thu United Slates is. not so
much greater than in liuropj lhat I believe
thu timer has arrived for Congress to lake this
subject into serious consideration.

Hint eud have com niltud deeds of violence,
but the proscciitiuu uud puuishment of many

uud when il will be unnecessary to curry on

DEPARTMENT OF THS INTERIOR.
The Secretary of the Interior reports satis
factory improvement aud progression In each
of the several bureaus under tbe control ot tho
Interior Dooartiueut. They uru all - In excel
lent coudiliou. The work whivb lu soma of
them tor some years has hnon In irrmn k..
been brought down to a recent date, and In nil
the current business baa been promptly dispatched.
THE INDIANS.
The policy wlricli was adopted t tiro
brginnliig ot tlw ndnrirristfation with re
gurJ to the ManngciiMint ot Indians lias
been as nuccessltil m ns most ardent
friends anticipated. Within m ahort a
titno it has reduced thu expense of their
management, decreased their tbragts tip
no thu white settlement, tended to give
the largest opportunity to tiro extension
of the great railways through tho pub
lic domain, and tho pushing (A settlo
ments into, wore rumote districts ot lh
country, and at tho same timo improve
Ihu condition c-f the IiidiiiDS. Tho poli
cy will bo maintained without any
change, excepting suclr as fiitihur experi
ence may show to bo necessary to render
it more efficient. Tho siihject of con
veitlng tho so-called Indian Territoiyl
south of Kansas, into a home lor the In
dians, nnd erecting thereon a territorial
form ol Government, is one oi great ini
jwi lance ns a complement ot tbe exist
ing Indian policy. The question ot re
moval to the territory has within the
past year been presented to many of the
tribes resident upon other and less desir
able portions of iho public domain, and
has generally been received by them
with favor. As a preliminary step to
the organization ot such a territory, it
will be necessary to confine the In
dians . now resident therein to farms
ot proper size, whicli should be secured
to lliem in fee ; the residue to boused
for tho settlement of other triendly In
dians. Ellbrts will he made in the im
mediate lntuie to induce tho removal ot
as many peaceably disposed Indians only
to the Indian Territory as can bo settltd
properly without disturbing the harmo
ny of those already there. There is no
oilier location now available where a
people who are endeavoring to acquire a
knowledge of pastoral and agricultural
pursuits can as well e accomodated as
upon the unoccupied lands iu the Indian
Territory.
A territorial goTernment should, bow-
ever, protect the Indians from the in
roads of whites for a term of years,
until they become sufficiently advanced
in the arts and civilization to guard
their own rights, anil irom the disposal
of lands held by them for the same period.
SALE OF PUBLIC LANDS.
During the List fiscal year tlrerc were
disposed of out ot the public lauds 11
804,975 acres, a quantity greater by
1,099,270 acre than was disposed f the

Tho cash receipts from all sotirccs in
the laud office amounted to $3,218,100.
Luring the same period 22,010,508 acres
of the publio land were vtirveyed, which
atlded 10 the quantity before surveyed,
amounts to 583,304,780 acres, leaving
1,257,033,023 acres of tho public lands
still iinsurveyed. The reports Irom the
subordinates ot the Laud Office contain
interesting information in regard to
their respective districts. They uniform
ly mention the fruit fulness of the soil
during the piiBt season, and the increas
ed yield ol all kinds ot produce evince,
in those States aud Territories where
mining is the principle business, tho ag
ricultural product to have exceeded the
local demand, and liberal shipments have
been mado to distant points.
PATENTS.
year
1872, lliere were issued irom the patent
urt'ileu 3,020 patents, 233 extensions,
and 550 curtiticairs and registers ot trade
marks. During the same time 19,587 ap
plications for patents, including reissues
and designs have been received, and 3,100
caveats tiled. Tho lees received during
the same period amounted to (70,095,980,
and the total expenditures to 1(02,355,390,
making the net receipts over ihe expendi
tures 7,740,050. Since 1830, two hun
dred thousand applications for patents
havo been tiled, and about 134,000 pat
ents issued.tho offices being conducted
under tlvi same laws and general organi-
z.ittonas were adopted; at their original
inauguration, when only irom one hun
dred lo tivo hundred applications were
made per annum. .Tho Commissioner
shows that the office lias outgrown the
original plan, and that a now organiza
tion has become necessary. This subject
was presented to Congress iu a special
communication in February last which
met my approvl and the appoval of the
Secratary of the Iuterior,and the suggest
ions contained in said communication
were embraced in a bill that was report
ed to tho House by the Committee on
Patents nt the last sessiem. The subject
of tho reorganization ot the Patent Office,
as contemplated by the bill reiered to, is
one of such inpoi'taiice to tho industrial
interests of the country that I commend
it to the attention of Congress. The
Commissioner also treats the subject of
the separaton of the Patent Office trom
the Department of the Interior. This
subject is also embraced in the bill here
tofore referred to. The Commissioner
complains of the want of room for the
model gallery and tor the working force
and necessary files of the office. It is
impossible to transact the business of the
office properly without more room in
which to arrange ntes aim arawings mat
must be consulted hourly in the transact
ion of business. The whole ol the Patent
Office building will soon bo needed, if it
it is not already, for the accommodation ot
the business ot the Patent Office.
PENSIONS.
amount paid pensions
last tlsoal year was 130,109,340, a'n
mount larger by $3,708,434, thau was
paid duiiug the proceeding year. Of
this amount $2,813,409 were paid under
tho act ot Congress of Feb, 17, 1871, to
survivors of the war ol 1812. The annu
al increase of pensions by the legislation
ot Congress has more than kept pace
with the natural yearly losses trom the
rolls. The act ot Congress of Juue 8,
1872, has added au estimated ouiout of
$750,000 per annum to the rolls, without
increasing the number of pensioners. We
cannot, therelore, look for any substan
tial decrease iu tho expenditures of this
Department for some time to come, or
so long as Congress continues to so
change the rates of pension. The whole
number of soldiers enlisted iu the war of
the Rebellion was 2,088,523. The total
number ot claims for invalid pension is
170,000, being but six per otnt of the
whole number of enlisted men. The to.

THE CENSUS.
Iho ninth census is about completed".
Its completion is a subject of congratu
lation, mat much as the Mo te lie made
of the statistics therein contained de
pends very greatly on the promptitude
of publication. The Secretary ot the in
terior recommends that a census be
taken in 1875, which leeommt-nddtibn
should receive the ready attention of
Congress. The interval at present estab
lished between the Federal census is so
long that llwt information obtained . at
the decenial periods as to the material
condition, wants and resources of the
natron is ot liulo practical value alter
the expiration ot the first half of that
period. It would probably obviate lh
constitutional provision regarding the
decennial census, if a census taken in.
1875 should be divested of all political
character and no reapportionment of
Congressional representation be made
under it. Snch a census, eoming as it
would in the last year ot the first, centu
ry of our national existence, would fur
nish a noble monument ot the progress
of the United Slates during that cuuttv-
ry-
TERRITORIAL AFFAIRS.
Affairs iu the territories nre generally
satisfactory. Tho energy and business
capacity of the pioneeis who are set
tling up tire vast domains not yet incor
porated into lates, are keeping pace its
internal improvements and civil govern
ment with tho older communities. Iu
but one of them, Utah, is the condition
of affairs unsatisfactory Except so far
as the quiet of the cilizen may be dis
turbed by real or imaginary danger of
Indian hostilities, it has seemed lo be
the policy of tbe Legislature of Utah-.te
evade all responsibility to the Govern
ment of the united States, and even to
hold a position in hostility to it. I re
commend a careful revision of the pres
ent laws ot the Territory by Congress,
aud the enactment ot such a law, as the
one proposed in Congress at its last ses
sion, for instance, or something similar
to it, as will secure peace, the equality
of all citizens bclore the law, aud the
utter extinguishment of polygamy.
Since the establishment ot a territori
al government for the District of Co
lumbia, the improvement of the condi-'
lion ot the city of Washington and sur
roundings, and the- increased prosperity
ot the citizens, is observable to tbe most
casual visitor. Tho nation being a larger
owner of properly in this city; slioufd
bear with 1 he cilizeus of the District A
just share ot the expense ot these im
provements. 1 recommend, therefore
an appropriation to reimburse tbe citi
zens lor the work done by them, along
and in front ot publio grounds during
the past year, and liberal appropriation
in order lhat the improvement aud em
bellishment of the publio buildings and
grounds may keep pace wiih the' im
provements made by the territorial au
AGRICULTURE.
.
The Report of the Commissioner of
Agriculture gives a very lull and inter
esting account ot the several divisions of
that department the horticultural, agri
cultural, statistical, entomological, and
chemical, aud ihe benefits conferred by
each upon agricultural interests of the
country. The whole report is a com
plete history in detail of tile workinga
of that department iu all Its branches,
showing the manner in which the farm
er, merchant, and miner is informed, and
the extent to which he is aided in his
pursuits. The Commissioner makes on
recommendation, that measures be taken
by Congress to protect and induoo the
planting of forests, and suggests that no
part of the public lauds should be dis
posed of without the condition that pns
lenlh of it be reserved in timber, where
it exists, and, where it does not exist,
iuduuemeuls should be offered for plant
ing it.
