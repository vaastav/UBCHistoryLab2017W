VOLUME XIV.- NUMBER 50.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Fellow-Citizens of the Senate
And House of Representatives :
Sinco your last annual assembling, an
other year of wealth and bountiful har
vests has passed; and while it has not
pleased the Almighty to bless us with a
return of peace, we can but press on, guid
ed by the light He gives us, trusting that
in His own good time aud way, all will
be well.
The correspondence touching foreign
affairs, has taken place during the last
year, is herewith eubuiitted, in virtual
compliance with a request to that effect,
made by tho House of Representatives,
•near tho close of the last session of Con
gress. If the coudition of our relations
with other nations is less gratifying than
it has usually been at former periods, it
is certainly more satisfactory than a na
tion so uuhappily distressed as we are
might reasonably have apprehended. Iu
the month of June last, there were some
grounds to expect that the maritime Dow
ers, which at the beginuing of our do
mestic difficulties, so unanimously and
unnecessarily,. as we think, recognized
tho insurgents as a belligereut, would
soon recede from that position, which lias
proved only less injurious to themselves
than to our own country ; but the tempo
rary reverses which afterward befell the
national arms, and which wore exaggerat
ed by our own disloyal children abroad,
have hitherto delayed that act of simple
justice.
The civil war which lias so radically
changed for the moment the occupations
aud habits of the American people, has
necessarily disturbed the social conditions
and affected very deeply the prosperity of
the nations with which we have carried
oil a commerce, that has been steadily in
creasing throughout a period of half a
century. It has at the same time excited
political ambitions and apprehensions,
which have profound agitation through
out the civilized world. In this unusual
agitation, we have fotb*rnc from taking
part iu any controversy between foreign
States aud between parties or factions in
such States. We have attempted no pro
pagandist!! and acknowledged rio revolu
tion. But we have left to every nation
the exclusive conduct aiul management
of its own affairs. ()ur struggle has beeu,
of course, contemplated by foreign na
tions with reference less to its own mer
its than to its supposed and often exag
gyrated effects, and the consequence re
sulting to those nations themselves. —
Nevertheless, complaint on the part of
this Government, even if it were just,
would certainly be unwise.
The treaty with Great Britain for the
suppression of the African slave-trade
has been put into operation with a good
prospect of complete success. It is an
occasion of special pleasure to acknowl
edge that the execution of it on the part
of her Majesty's Government has been
marked by a jealous respect for tho au
thority of the United States and the
rights of their moral and loyal citizens.
The Convention with Hanover for the
abolition of the Stade dues has been car
ried into full effect under the act of Con
gress for that purpose.
A blockade of 3,000 miles of sea-coast
couid not bo established aud vigorously
enforced in a sfcasou of great commercial
activity like the present without commit
ting occasional mistakes and inflicting
n C
unintentional injuries upon foreign na
tions and their subjects. A civil war oc
curring in a country where foreigners re
side and carry on trade, under treaty stip
ulations, is necessarily fruitful of com
plaints of tho violation of neutral rights.
All such collisions tend to excite mis
apprehensions, and possibly, to produce
mutual reclamations between nations
which have a common interest in pre
serving peace and friendship. In clear
cases of these kinds, I have, so far as pos
sible, heard and redressed complaints
which have been presented by friendly
Dowers. There is, however, a large and
augmenting number of doubtful cases,
upon which tho Government is unable to
agree with the Governments whose pro- j
tcction is demanded by the claimants.—
There arc, moreover, many cases in which
the United States or their citizens suffer
wrongs from tho naval or military au
thorities of foreign nations, which the
Governments of these States are not at
once prepared to redress. I have pro
posed to some of tho foreign States thus
interested, mutual conventions to exam
ine and adjust such complaints. This
proposition lias been made especially to
Great Britain, to France, to Spain, and
to Drussia. Iu each case, it has been for
mally adopted. I deem it my duty to
recommend an appropriation in behalf of
the owners of the Norwegian Bark Ad-j
rniral P. Fordens Riola, which vessel was,
in May, 1861, prevented by the comman
der of the blocading force off Charleston
iiojn leaving that port with cargo, not
withstanding a similar privilege had
shortly before been granted to an English
vessel. 1 have direoted the Secretary of
State to cause the papers iu the case to
be communicated to tho proper commit
tees.
Applications have been made to mc by
many free Americans of African descent
to favor their emigration, with a view to
such colonization as was contemplated in
recent acts of Congress. Other parties,
at home and abroad, some from interested
motives, others upon patriotic considera
tions, and still others induced by philan
thropic sentiments, have suggested simi
lar measures ; while on the other hand,
several of the Spanish American Repub
lics have protested against sending of such
colonies to their respective territories.—
Under these circumstances, I have de
clined to mcve any such colony to any
State without first obtaining the consent
of its Government, with an agreement on
its part to receive and protect such emi
grants in all their rights as freemen, and
I have at the same time offered to the
several States situated in the tropics, or
having colonies there, to negotiate with
them, subject to the advice and consent
of the Senate, to favor the voluntary emi
gration of persons of that class to their
respective territories upon conditions
which shall be equal, just and humane.
Liberia aud Ilayti are as yet the only
countries to whioh colonists of African
descent from hero could go and with cer
tainty of being received and adopted as
citizens, and I regret to say that such
persons contemplating colonization do not
seem so willing to emigrate to those coun
tries as to some others, nor so willing as
1 think their interest demands. I be
live, however the opinion among tliem in
this respect is improving, and that ere
long there will be an augmented and con
siderable emigration to both these coun
tries from the United States.
The new commercial treaty betweon
the United States and the Sultan of Tur
key has been carried into execution. A
commercial and consular treaty has been
negotiated, subject to the Senate's cou
sent, with Liberia, and a similar negotia
tion is now pending with the Republic of
Hayti. A considerable improvement of
the national coinmereo is expected to re
sult from these measure's. Oiy relations
with great Britain, France, Spain, Portu
gal, Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden,
Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome,
and the other European States, remain
undisturbed. Very favorable relations
also oontinua to be maintained with Tur
key, Morocco, China and Japan. During
tho last year, there has not only been no
change of our previous relations with the
independent States of our own continent,
but more friendly scutiments than have
heretofore existed are believed to be en
tertained by these neighbors, whose safe
ty and progress are 60 intimately connect
ed with our own. This statement spe
cially applies to Mexico, Costa Rica, Nic
aragua. Honduras, Peru and Chili. The
Commission under the Convention with
the Republic of New Granada closed its
session without having audited and passed
upon all tho claims which were submitted
to it. A proposition is pending to revive
the Convention, that it may be able to
do more complete justice. The Commis
sion between tho United States and the
Republic of Costo Rica has completed its
labors and submitted its report. I have
favored the project for connecting the
United States with Europo by an Atlan
tic Telegraph, and a similar project to ex
tend the telegraph from San Francisco, 1
to connect by a Pacific Telegraph with
the wire which is "being extended across
the Russian Empire.
The Territories of the United States,
with unimportant exceptions, have re
mained undisturbed by the civil war, and
they are exhibiting such evidence of pros
perity as justifies an expectation that
some of them will soon be in a condition
to bo organized as States, and bo consti
tutionally admitted into the Union.—
The immense mineral resources of some ;
of these Territories ought to be develop
ed as rapidly as possible. Every step in
that direction would have a tendeney to
disprove the revenues of the Government,
and diminish tho burdens of tho people. I
It is worthy of your serious consideration
whether some extraordinary measures to'
promote that end cannot be adopted. The
means which suggests itself as most likely j
to be effective, is a scientific exploration |
of tho mineral regions in these territories
with a view to the publication of its re
sults at homo and in foreign countries,
results which cannot fail to bo auspi
cious.
The condition of the finanoes will claim
your most dilligent consideration. The
vast expenditures incident to the milita
ry and naval operations required for the
suppression of the Rebellion have hither
to been met with a promptitude and cer
tainly unusul in similar circumstances,
and the public oredit has been fully main
tained. The continuance of the war, how
ever, and the increased disbursements
made necessary by the augmented forces
now in the field demand your best reflec
tions as to the best modes of providing
the necessary revenues without injury to
business, and with the least possible bur-

dens upon labor. The suspension of spe
cie payments by the banks soon after the
commencement of your last session made
large issues of United States notes una
voidable. In no other way could the pay
ment of the troops, and the satisfaction of
other just demands, be so economically or
as well provided for. The judicious leg
islation of Congress securing the receiv
ability of these notes for loans and inter
nal duties, and making them a "legal ten
der" for other debts, has made them uni
versal currency, and has satisfied, partial
ly at least, and for the time, the long-felt
want of an uniform circulating medium,
saving thereby to the people immense
sums iu discounts and exchanges.
A return to specie payments, however,
at the earliest period compatible with due
regard to all interests, should ever be
kept in view.
Fluctuations in the value of currency
are always injurious, and to reduce these
fluctuations to the lowest possible point
will always be a leading purpose in wise
legislation.
Convertibility, prompt arid certain,con
vertibility into coin, is generally acknowl
edged to be the best and surest safeguard
against them, and it is extremely doubt
ful whether a circulation of the United
States notes, payable iu coin, and suffi
ciently large tor the wants of the people,
can be permanently, usefully, and safely
maintained. Is there, then, any other
mode in which the necessary provission
for the public wants can be made, and
the great advantages of a safe and uni
form currency secured ?
I know of none whioh promises so cer
tain results, and at tho same timo s un
objectionable, as the organization of Bank
ing Associations under a general act of
Congress, well guarded iu its provisions.
To such associations, tho Government
might furnish circulating notes on the se
curity of United States bonds deposited
in the Treasury. These notes, prepared
under tho supervision of proper offioers,
being uniform in appearance and securi
ty, and convertible always into coin,
would at once protect labor againßt the
evils of a vicious currency, and facilitate
commcroe by cheap and safe exchanges.
A moderato reservation from the interest
on the bonds would compensenate the
United States for the preparation and dis
tribution of the notes, and a general su
pervision of the system, and would light
en the burden of that part of the public
debt employed as securities. The public
credit, morover, would be greatly im
proved, and the negotiations of new loans
greatly facilitated by tho steady market
demand for Government bonds which the
adoption of the proposed system would
create.
It is an additional recommendation of
the measure, of considerable weight in
my judgment, that it would reconcile, as
far as possible, all oxistiug interests, by
the opportunity offered to existing insti
tutions to reorganize under the act, sub
stituting ODly the secured uniform nation
al circulation for the local and various
circulation, secured and unsecured, now
issued by them.
The receipts into the Treasury from all
sources, including loans and balance from
the preceding year, for the fiscal year end
ing on the 30tb of June, 1862, were 8583,-
885,247 06, of which sura 849,056,397
62 were derived from customs; 81,795,-
231 73 from the direct tax; from public
lands, 8152,203 77 ; from miscellaneous
sources, 8931,787 64 ; from loans in all
forms, 8529,692,460 50. The remain
der, 82,257.065 80 was the balance from
last year. The disbursements during the
same period were :, For Congressional,
Executive and Judicial purposes, 85,939,-
009 29 ; tor foreign tntercourso, 81,339,- ;
710 35; for miscellaneous expenses, in
cluding the Mints, Loans, Post-Office de-i
ficieucies, collection of revenue and other
like charges, 814,129,771 50; for ex
penses under the Interior Department,
83,102,985 52; under the War Depart-,
ment, 8394,368,407 36; under tho Navy j
Department, 842,673,569 69; for inter-;
est on the public debt, 814,180,324 45;
and for the payment of the publio debt, j
including reimbursemont of temporary
loans and redemptions, 896,096,922 09 ;
making an aggregate of 8570,841,700 25,
and leaving a balance in the Treasury on
the Ist day of July, 1862, of 813,043,- (
546 81. It should be observed that the 1
sum of 896,096,922 09, expended for re- :
imhurseuients and redemption of the pub- j
lie debt, being included also in the loans,
made, may be properly deduoted both
from the receipts and expenditures leav
ing the actual receipts for the year 8474,-
744,788 16. Other information on the !
subject of tho finances will be found in
the Report of the Secretary of the Treas
ury, to whose statements and views I in
vite your moat candid and considerate at
tention.
The report of the Secretaries of the
Navy and War are herewith transmitted.
These Reports, though lengthy, are
scarcely more than brief abstracts of the
very numerous and extensive transactions
aud operations conducted through these
Departments, nor could I give a summa
ry of them here upon any principle which
would admit of its being much shorter
than the Reports themselves. I there
fore content myself with laying the Re
ports before you, and asking your atten
tion to them.
It gives me pleasure to report a decid
ed improvement in the financial condition
of the Post Office Department as compared
With several preceding years. The re
ceipts for the fiscal year 1861 amounted
to 4O, which embraced the
revenue from all the States of the Union
for three-quarters of that year. Not
withstanding the cessation of revenue
from the so-called Seceded States during
the last fiscal year, the increase of tho cor
respondence of the loyal States has been
sufficient to produce a revenue during the
same year of 88,299,820 90, beiDg only
850,000 less than was derived from all
the States of the Union during the pre
vious year. The expenditures show a
still more favorable result. The amount
expended iu 1801 was 813,006,759 11.
For the last year the amount has been re
duced to 811,125,304 13, showing a de
crease of about 82,481,000 iu the expen
ditures as compared with the preceding
year, and about 83,750,000 as compared
with the fiscal year 1860. Tho deficien
cy in the Department for the previous
year was 84,551,90G 98. For the last
fiscal year it was reduced to 82,112,814-
56. These favorable results are, in part,
owing to the cessation of mail service in
the iusurrectionary States, aud iu part to
a casual review of all expenditures in that
Department, iu the interest of economy.
The efficiency of the Postal service it is
believed has also been much improved.
The Postmaster-General also opened a
correspondence, through the Department
of State, with foreigu Governments, pro
posing a convention of Postal Represen
tatives for the purpose of simplifying the
rates of foreigu postage and to expedite
the foreigu mails. This preposition,
equally important to our adopted citizens
and to the commercial interests of this
country, has boen favorably entertained
and agreed to by all the Governments
from whom replies have been received.
I ask the attention of Congress to the
suggestions of the Postmaster General in
his Report respecting the further legisla
tion required, in his opinion, for the ben
efit of tho postal service.
The Secretary of the Interior reports
as foliows in regard to the public lands:
'fTho Public Lands have ceased to be a
source of revenue. From the Ist of July,
1801, to the 30th September, 1802, the
entire cash receipts from the sale of lands
were 8137,476 20, a sum much less than
the expense of our land system during
the same period. The Homestead Law,
which will take effect on the Ist of Jan
uary next, offers such inducements to set
tlers that sales for cash cannot be expected
to an extent sufficient to meet the expon
as of the General Land Office, and tho
cost of surveying and bringing the land
into market.
. The discrepancy between the sum here
stated as arising from tho sales of the
publio lands and the same derived from
! the same source as reported from the
Treasury Department, arises, as I under
stand, from the fact that the periods of
time, though apparently wero not really
conincident at the beginning point, the
Treasury Report, including a considerable
sum now which had previously beeu
reported from the Interior, sufficiently
1 large to greatly overreach the sum derived
from the three months now reported upon
by the Interior, and not by the Treasury.
The Indian tribes upon our frontiers
have, during the past year, manifested a
spirit of insubordination, and at several
points have engaged in open hostilities
against the white settlements in their
vicinity. The tribes occupying the Indian
country south of Kansas renounced their,
allegiance to the United States, and
j entered into treaties with the insurgents.!
| Those who remained loyal to the United
States were driven from the country. —
The Chief of the Cherokee has visited
this city for the purpose of restoring tho !
former relations of the tribo with the'
United States. lie alleges that they
were constrained by superior force to enter
into treaties with the insurgents, and that
the United States neglected to furnish
the prctectiod which their treaty stipu
lations required.
In the month of August last, the Sioux
Indians, in Minnessota, attacked the set
tlements in their vicinity with extreme
ferocity, killing, indiscriminately, men,
women, and children. This attack was
wholly unexpected, and therefore, no
means of defense had been provided. It
is estimated that no less than 800 persons
were killed by the Indians, and a large
amount of pfoperty was destroyed. How
this outbreak was induced is not defi
nitely known, and suspicions, which may
be unjust, need not to be stated. In
formation was received by the Indian
Bureau from different sources, about the
time hostilities wero commenced. * *
simultaneous attack was L a " 1 e U P OU |
the white settlements by all the tribes
between the Mississippi River and the
Rocky Mountains. The State of Min
nessota has suffered great injury from
this Indian war. A large portion of her
territory has been depopulated, and a
severe loss has been sustained by the
destruction of property. The people of
that State manifest much anxiety for the
removal of the tribes beyond the limits
of the State as a guaranty against further
hostilities. The Comissioner of Indian
Affairs will furnish lull details.
I submit for your especial consideration
whether our Indian system shall not be
remodeled. MaDy wise and good men
have been impressed with tho belief that
this can be profitably done.
I submit a statement of the proceed
ings of the Commissioners, which shows
the progress that has been made, in the
enterprise of constructing tho Pacific
Railroad, and this suggests the earliest
completion of the road, and also the fa
vorable action of Congress upon the
projeeta now peuding before them for
enlarging the capacities of the great ca
nals in New York abd Illinois, as being
of vital and rapidly increasing importance
to tho whole nation, and especially to the
vast interior regiou hereinafter to be
noticed at socno greater length. I pro
pose having prepared and laid before you
at an early day, some interesting and
valuable statistical information upon this
subject. The military and commercial
importance of enlarging the Illinois and
Michigan Canal, and improving tho Illi
nois RiveU is presented in the report of
Col. Webster to the Secretary of War,
and now transmitted to Congress. I re
spectfully ask attention to it.
To carry out the provisions of the act
;of Congress of the 15th of May last, I
: have caused tho Department of Agricul
• turc of the United States to be organized.
The Commissioner informs me that within
the period of a few months this Depart
ment has established an extensive system
of correspondence and oxchange, both at
home and abroad, which promises to
effeot highly beneficial results in the
development of a correct knowledge of
recent improvements iu agriculture, in
the introduction of new products, and in
the collection of tlio agricultural statistic
of the different States. Also, that it will
soon bo prepared to distribute largely
seeds, cereals, plants, and cuttings, and
has already published and liberally dif
fused much valuable information in an
ticipation of a more elaborate report,
which will in due time be furnished, em
bracing some valuable tests iu chemical
science BOW in progress in the labratory.
The creation of this Department was for
the more immediate benefit of a large
class of our most valuable citizens, and I
trust that the liberal basis upon which it
has been organized will not only meet
your approbation, but that it will realize
at no distant day all tho fondest antici
pations of its most sanguine friends, aud
become the fruitful sourco of advantage
to all our people.
On tho 22d day of September last, a
proclamation was issued by the Execu
tive, a copy of which is herewith sub
mitted. In accordance with the purpose
expressed in the second paragraph of
that paper, I now respectfully call your
attention to what may bo called "Com
peosated Emancipation." A nation ma)
bo said to consist of its territory, its peo
pie, and its laws. The territory is th<
only part which is of certain durability
One generation passcth away and anothei
generation cometh, hut theeartb abideth
forever. It is of the first importance tc
duly consider and estimate this ever en
during part. That portion of the earth's
surface which is owned and inhabited by
the people of the United States is well
adapted to be the home of one national
family, and it is not well adapted for two
or more. Its vast extent and its variety
of climate and production are of advan
-1 tage in this age for one people, whatever
they might have been in fermor ages.
Steam and telegraphs, in intelligence,
have brought these to be an advantageous
combination foj one united people.
In my Inaugtiral Address, I briefly
pointed out the total inadequacy of dis
union as a remedy for the differences be
tween the people of tho two sections. I
did so in language which I cannot im
prove, and which, therefore, I bog to
repeat: "One section of our country
believes Slavery is light aud ought to
be extended, wbilo the other believes it
is wrong and ought not to bo extended.
This is the only substantial dispute,
j The Fugitive Slave clause of the Con
stitution and the law for the suppression
of the African slave-trade are each as
well enforced, perhaps, as any law can
ever be in a community where the moral
sense of the people imperfectly supports,
the law itself. The great body of the
people abide by the dry legal obligation
lin both cases, and a f"" break over in
each. This T cannot be perfectly 1
cnr „j, and it would be worse in both 1
eases after the separatiou of the sections
than before. The foreign blave-tiade, j

only partially surrendered, would not be

ically speaking, we canbot SfepbrtttuJ

from each other, nor build an impassably
wall between them. A husband and wife
may be divorced, and go out of the proa*
euce and beyond the reach of each other)
but the different parts of oiir Ootlntry
cannot do this. They cannot but remain
face to face, and intercouse, either ami

them. Is it possible, then, to make thai
intercourse more advantageous or mora

There is no lino, straight or crooked*
suitable for a national boh idary upon
which to divide. Trace through from
east to West, upon the line jbetWeeo the

writing it down on paper or parbhroenk

But there is another difficulty. The
cre?t interior region bounded iast by the
Alleghanies, north by the Britjsh domiri

.south by the line along which the culture
of com and cotton meets, and which in

aud will have fifty millions within fifty
years, if not provented bv any bolitical
tolly or mistake. It contains mire thatt
one-third of the country owned \by the
United States, certainly more that! one
million of square miles. If half ha pop
ulous as Massachusetts already! is, it
would have mote than seventy-five mil
lions of people. A glance at thb map
shows that, territorially speaking! it is
the great body of the Republic".\ Thtj
other parts are btit marginal borders td

from the Rocky Mountains to the

undeveloped resources. In the pronbti
tiou of provisions, grains, grasses, (and
all which proceed from them, this great
interior region is uaturally the most im-

the statistics the small proportion of (the

truth remains that none south of it can
