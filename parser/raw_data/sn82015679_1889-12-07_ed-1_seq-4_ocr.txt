f -. ... . .1 -Tii T1
ic arc the two most irrepressible letter
writers of the day.
Since the death of Jefferson Davis
thtro ia only one other man living whom
Democrats recognise as an ex-President.
If any net of Congress can reach trusts
and combines, that drawn by Senator
Sherman will do it. He h a full-grown
statesman.
Intelligent Indianians have always
looked upon -David Turpio as a two
penny statesman, but it appears, accord
ing t his one-cent pension bill, that he
belongs to the single penny grade.
Wjikx the Republicans came in pos
session of the government, in 18C1, they
fonnri an empty treasury. AVhen they
regain control of the House of Repre
sentatives in 1829 they find an empty
safe.
Senator David Tukpie is endeavor
ing to steal some of Voorhees's cam
paign material by posing as the "sol
diers' friend." Indiana Union veterans
can mvasnre Turpies love for them
without a yard-stick. .
True to their instincts, the mugwump
papers in New York city the Times, the
Post and Harpers Weekly are opposed
to holding a world's fair. The pecu
liarities of tho mugwump can only bo
accounted for on the ground of chronic
dyspepsia.
Senator VoonirEF.s, having tabled
his resolution directed at the tariff, will,
it is understood, make a tariff speech at
an early day. Before tho advent of Mr.
Cleveland as tho Moses of the Demo
cratic party Mr. Voorhees was sonic
thing of a protectionist.
Tnv. Jolins Hopkins University peo
ple are making an unnecessary fuss over
tho Baltimore boy to whose fingers
everything sticks fast. Such persons
arc not of phenomenal variety. Tho
Democratic party is full of them, and
their propensity is to allow public funds
to adhero to their fingers.
' So long a Grover Cleveland confines
his letters to half a dozen lines he can
do fairly well in the matter of composi
tion, but longer efforts tangle him up.
If he is going to continue tho epistolary
business until the next campaign ho
ought to engage the services of Private
Secretary Lauiout at once.
OSEof the objections raised against As
sociate Justice Brcweristhat he has made
decisions favoring the Prohibitionists,
On the contrary, the only opinion he ever
wrote which was fcet aside by the Su
preme Court, was that hi which ho laid
down the doctrine tint the State had no
light to enact laws which destroy pri
vate property without compensating the
owners.
President Hamilton, accompanied by
.First Assistant Postmaster - general
.Clarkson and Mrs. Clarkson, Miss Wana
maker and Piivato Secretary Halfonl,
will reach the city this afternoon,
and remain hero over Sunday, en
route to Chicago. The President goes to
the latter city at the urgeut request of
citizens to attend tho opening of the
Auditorium. His visit here is merely to
enjoy a few hours quietly in his old
Lome and among family and friends.
The Journal publishes, this morning,
the first of a series of letters intended
to give the latest and fullest informa
tion concerning the development of tho
natural-gas field in this State. Few
perna outside of Indiana are awaro of
the ?alue and extent of this discovery,
and many within the State do not yet
italize what an impetus it has given to
home industries and how great a pourco
of wealth and prosperity it is proving.
The letters nublUhtd this morning rc-
lato to Delaware and Madison counties,
and principally to Muncie and Anderson.
Poth of these cities have profited greatly
ly tho introduction of the new fuel, and
have rece ived a large influx of popula
tion and capital. In respect of agri
cultural resources there arc hardly two
counties in the State superior to Dela
ware and Madison, and the discovery of
natural gas is fast making their county
seats manufacturing centers. The let
ters published this morning will be fol
lowed by others relating to other parts
of the gas field, all of which offers rare
inducements to investors and manufacturers.
"IHE EX-PRESIDENT."
No doubt many readers of the Journal
were disgusted and angered by the tone
of the New Orleaus dispatch yesterday
announcing the death of Jefferson Davis.
As an Associated Press dispatch, It
naturally reflected the color of Southern
sentiment. The expression of profound
respect for the deceased was almost
overshadowed by sympathy for tho lost
cause. He was referred to once as Mr.
Davis, and six times as "tho ex-President."
. Repented reference was made to
his "Christian resignation," his "Chris
tian composure'1 and "his undaunted
Christian spirit," as if to show how
peacefully the career of a great and
good man could close.
With Mr. Davis's religion and rela
tions to the hereafter wo have nothing
to do. His friends know as little of
them as do his enemies. Millions of
better Christians have lived and died
obscurely, with the 6amo undaunted
Christian spirit and with a faith far
better grounded in good life and works.
It is no special mark of greatness or
grace in any man to meet death without
a murmur or to accept tho inevitable
without protest. Most men do when
they cannot help themselves. It was
not to be expected that the laws of
nature or of nature's God would be sus
pended for Jefferson Davis.
Tho repeated reference to "tho ex
President" is intentionally irritating to
the loyal sentimont of the country. Of
what was Jefferson Davis the president!
Of an attempt to destroy the Union,
which resulted in ignoble failure and a
gigantic war, causing the sacrifice of
hundreds of thousands of lives, and an
amount of human suffering and misery
beyond the power of tho human mind
to conceive. He was the President of a
vain endeavor to establish a government
whose corner-stone should bo human
slavery, and of which ho and his per
sonal followers expected to become tho
leading aristocrats and rulers. He
was the President of a greater
amount of national disaster, hu
man suffering and organized hell
than any man of modern times. Doubt
less there were persons, who, as long as
they lived, continued to speak respect
fully of "tho late Benedict Arnold," and
to deprecate the obloquy visited on
the memory of "ex-Vice-president
Aaron Burr;" but history has as
signed these men their proper places, as
it will also Jefferson Davis, the leader
of an army of traitors, and the president
of a bloody rebellion against a govern
ment which proved all too mild in its
subsequent treatment of him.
Southern men who continue their
hero-worship of Jeflerson Davis are
fooU. No other word will tit the case
they are fools. Davis was beyond
comparison tne worst enemy tne
South ever had. But for him the South
ern States never would have entered
upon the mad attempt to destroy tho
Union. He, more than any other one
man, was responsible for the horrors of
the war; and if he could have had his
way, he would have continued' them
much longer. His implacable hate and
fear of personal punishment by tho gov
ernment he had sought to destroy caused
the war to be continued long after suc
cess was hopeless. Even after he had
lied from Richmond, and only three
days before Lee's surrender, Davis is
sued a bombastic proclamation from
Danville. Va., calling on the Southern
people to rally to his standard. In this
proclamation he said:
We have now entered upou a new phase
of the strusjile. Relieved from the neces
sity of guarding particular points, our army
will be freo to move from point to point to
strike the enemy in detail far from his base.
Let us but will it, aud we are free. Ani
mated bv that confidence in spirit and
fortitude which never yet failed me, I an
nounce to you, fellow-countrymen, that it
i my purpose to maintain your cause w ith
my whole he.irt and sou!, and that I will
never consent to abandou to the enemy oue
foot of tho toil of any ouo of the States of
the Confederacy.
If Davis did not know that thecoufed
erato cause was completely lost at that
time he was a fool, and if he knew it,
and simply wanted to rally a body
guard and continue a guerrilla warfare,
he was a knave. In either case he was
a malignant traitor aud implacable
rebel, as. ho continued to be at heart
while ho lived. Of course, Southern
gush and slush over the leader of the re
bellion must have its say, even as he
himself was permitted to, long after he
should have been hanged for treason;
but when he is culoirized ns the ex-
Prcsideut" we may be permitted to offer
a few words of explanation.
THE SILC0TTE0B3EST.
The defalcation of C. K. Silcott, cash
ier of the House of Representatives, is
one of the largest anil most scandalous
that has ever occurred in the national
'government. In magnitude it is only
surpassed by the big defalcations of
Treasurer Tate in Kentucky and Treas
urer .Buvko iu Louisiana, both felbiw
Democi ats of Silcott's. These, however,
were State affairs. Silcott's robbery is
the largest in recent years, and one of
the largest that has ever occurred in the
national government. His otlicial term
dates from 1 when the Democrats ob
tained control of the House, ami helms
continued from year to year under that
regime. Perhaps lie might have got
away with a bigger pile at some former
time, but l:e heems to have preferred to
hold ou as long as he could, and take his
chances of getting away with all that
was in fight.
Silcott Avas an Ohio man aud imbibed
his Democracy in a school where "the
barrel" is omnipotent. The position
of cashier to the. House seems to have
been quite to his taste. Ho was
"a trusted employe," and Sergcant-at-arm
Leedom wiys "ho becnied to have
no more than the ordinary man's share
of vices." He seems to have one man's
full share, at least, and in the light of
events some will think he could have
spared a few. Although Silcott was a
man of family, it seems to have been an
open secret iu Washington for some
time past that he was living the life of
a libertine and squandering money on
lewd women. As he patronized bucket
shops, he was doubtless an habitual
gambler in other ways. If these and
kindled habits do not constitute "more
than an ordinary man's share of
vices," they are at least enough to dis
qualify a man from holding a position
where he handles hundreds of thousands
of dollars of government money. There
is no reason whj Sergeant-at-arms
Leedom should have been surprised at
Silcott's robbery if he knew what every
body else seems to know concerning
Silcott's habits. High living, wine,
women and gambling are poor recom
mendations for an official who holds the
keys of j our safe, and your honor aud
fortune in his hands. .
Silcott's robbery will lead to a re
form in the manner of keeping the
accounts of the House. Tho sys
tem, if it can be called so, seems
to have been a very loose one,
devoid of checks and inviting to abuses
if not dishonesty. The cashier handles
all the money to pay members' salaries
and expenses of the House, and for this
sum, amounting to several hundred
thousand dollars a year, ho checks di
rectly on the Treasury. Members may
overdraw their accounts, or may leave
their salaries on deposit with him. Xo
doubt tho arrangement has been con
tinued partly because it was a very con
venient one for members. This robbery
will compel a reform. There should bo
a regular disbursing clerk of the House,
and his accounts should be subjected to
tho same rules regarding the drawing of
money, vouchers, auditing, etc., as those
of tho disbursing officers. The House
owes it to itself and the country to order
this reform.
President Hakwsox's theory of a de
pendent pension law utterly perverts the
idea upou which pensions are granted by
every civilized nation. It adds a new
calamity to war.
So cries the Philadelphia Record, and
so far as it asserts that the Republican
pension policy announced by the Presi
dent is not in accord with that of other
civilized nations, it is correct. All civil
ized nations that have been dealing
with pensions have been monarchies or
those recently escaping from that form
of government. If we had adopted tho
pension system of any of these nations
the veterans would have been granted
the merest pittance, and millions would
not have been expended in creating sol
diers' homes. The pension laws of the
Republic aro based upou the idea of
equal citizenship, while those of Euro
pean nations are grounded upon the
theory of the recipient being a subject.
And here we may ask if it ever occurred
to the Record that thero would bo no
United States of America, with a repub
lican form of government, if our fore
fathers had been governed by European
precedents. The trouble with tho Rec
ord is that its sole idea is free trade, and
the paper that has no other can never
rise to the level of national patriotism
or bo inspired by the generous sentiment
of gratitude.
Scarcely an election occurs in Mis
sissippi that a new feature is not added
to the plan devised some years ago in
that State to suppress Republican, ma
jorities. The latest improvement is an
nounced iu Jackson, where a municipal
election is o be held. The Republican
majority is large there, so special i;fforts
must be made to overcome it. Last year
it was done by violence, and this year a
committee has been appointed "to see
that the Democratic ticket is elected."
Yet there are men who seem to believe
that Congress should continue to allow
this suppression of suffrage to go on and
control the political complexion of the
national House more than three-fourths
of tho time.
The silly Southern gush about Jeffer
son Davis's lovely character and Chris
tian resignation would lead those igno
rant of his career tobelieve him to be one
of the saints of the earth. But Sout hern
gush really means nothing. If Davis
ever did anything in his life to make the
world better, the world, North or South,
has never discovered it. He was far,
very far, from being a saintly character,
and Wijs never so described, until now.
by his admirers; while his death-bed
"resignation" was the kind most people
feel when the inevitable is upon them a
matter of necessity.
In some portions of Mississippi, saj's
tho New Orleans States, the church peo
ple have become so iu tensely devoted to
prohibition that any one who refuses to
join tho church and swear allegiance to
prohibition is ostracized and his busi
ness destroyed. The States adds that
this spirit of fanaticism has quite para
lyzed some of the towns and compelled
tho more liberal people to sell their
property and leave. Why cannot a tew
of the same class in other States who
are equally as intolerant emigrate to
Mississippi?
Ik the reports from the various secret
conferences and midnight pow-wows
between Messrs. Powdcrly, Evan Jones
and their followers, now going on in St.
Louis, be true, the farmers' organiza
tions there represented are going to be
persuaded to swallow the Henry George
doctrines, General Weaver, of Iowa, and
several other heterogeneous things. If
the various alliances and "wheels" do
not stand in need of a robust dose of
Jamaica ginger iu the near future it will
be odd.
The bill already introduced in Con
gress to pay Mr. Aquilla Jones, late post
master at this city, S2,43, stolen from
the office in December, 188, should be
promptly passed. That robbery might
have occurred under any administra
tion of the office, and as Mr. Jones w as
in no degree responsible foi it, he should
be promptly relieved from its conse
quences. '
lTiscnrioustonoteth.it many news
papers of the East and Southeast speak
I of Judge Brewer as "tho President's
discovery," a man "heretofore un
known." These able editors should
wake up and read up a little on tho af
fairs of the vast transmississippi coun
try; Throughout that whole region,
which is by far the larger half of the
Union in extent, thero is not a better
known or more highly respected man on
the bench than this same Judge Brewer.
The Journal welcomes the President
of the United States to the city of his
residence. In a long aud honorable ca
reer he has served the State faithfully
in various trusts, and now its people
welcome and honor him as the chosen
head of the Nation. That the President
conies almost unannounced and not in a
political or public capacity, makes it
none the less a grateful service to bid
him welcome to Indiana and to Indian
apolis. The reports of the sessions of the
Farmers' Alliance, in St. Louis, wou!d
indicate that it is a remnant of the old
Greenback party. Its delegates favor
the free coinage of silver, because it is
tho "poor man's money." They un
doubtedly believe so; but, alas! that
does not make it thus. Tho silver-mine
owners arc capitalists. Again, how can
a farmer get a silver dollar any easier
than any other, having no silver bullion
to bo coined?
Shade of Daniel Webster! To think
that a man bearing the name of D. E.
Webster should have the effrontery to
appear before the Senate and ask that
the national title bo changed to "United
States of Columbia." In a year or 60 wo
aro going to celebrate the arrival of Co
lumbus at a little bland to the south
east, but wo are not, therefore, going to
drop a time-honored, if originally in
appropriate, name. No Webster need
expect it.
To the young men of the United States:
Yes, boys, there never was a better time

The story is out that Eddie Gould, the
second son of Jay, has plaj'ed his father
and elder brother a sharp game in regard to
Missouri Pacific stock. The latter had
formed a pool to boost Missouri Pacific, and
did force large amounts up to 72, bat it
wonld go no higher. That led the parties
in the clique to suspect that Jay Gould was
"queering" his own deal, but he denied it,
and proved his good faith by buying more
stock. The end came, and the stock fell to
CO. It was then discovered that Eddie was
among the "bears," and had taken a prom
inent part in breaking the market, getting
$125,000, which must have come largely from
his father and elder brother.
That is a discreet bill introduced by
Senator Ingalls in regard to the world's

present the merits of their respective cities

It is getting to be an unusual day when
Cincinnati does not tnrn up with a defal

"Paris of America."

His elevation to the Speaker's desk will de

curb his inclination for satire and denun

Mr. Reed's Integrity.
Brooklyn Eagle (Dem.)
But neither his possiblo admiration of
Boston capitalists nor his respect for the
feelings of the Santa Fe road in the "Chero

bashfulness of the Union Pacific about pay
ing its debts could induce Thomas B. Reed
to deviate the broadth of a hair from his
duty to his party, to his country or to him
self in the nigh aud responsible orlice to
whicn he has been chosen. The intimation
of the Boston correspondent that Mr. Reed
cau be used by any corporation for an im
proper or dishonorable purpose is one of
those cheap and familiar euorts of tho
imagination of writers whose hostility to
all corporations ha become a mania.

especially with that portion bearing on tbe

The dissatisfied colored element, which has
been pretty noisy of late, will now vanish

Who the Critics Are.
KushviUe Republican.
President Harrison's severest critics,
within the party, are men who have been
disappointed iu getting office for them
selves or friends. The man who is not a
good Republican without an office, is not
one at any time. He is a mere place-hunter.

tive utterance of a cautious and discreet
statesman.

tho ablest state papers of our most dis
tinguished Presidents.
Muncie News: The President's message
is a wise and able document discussing the
important subjects before the country in a
masterly manner.
Winamac Republican: From beginning
to end the message is clear, dignified, strong
aud earned It is in direct keeping with
the platform upon which the President was
elected.
Vincennes Commercial: There are no re
markable departures in the message, but it
is just such a document as would bo ex
pected from as careful and! conservative
President. ' ,
Crawfordsville. Journal: It is a dignified
and able document, fertile in suggestions
anil cautious in recommendations. It will
command the respect, if it does not the in
dorsement, of the people.
Attica Ledger: The Presideut struck
twelve in his message when he kaid that
the government must have no private banks
to which t loan the people's money, with
out interest. . It was not so with Mr. Cleve
land, ex-reformer. .
Richmond Palladium: The message is
sound, patriotic and statesmanlike, and
commends itself to the sound sense of tho
country. It is long, but as a first message,
defining the policy of tiie administration, it
could not well be'made shorter.
La t)orte Plain Dealer: A better document
has never been promulgated from the
White House. It is written in a bold style.
Nothing is smoothed over, and the facts
are delivered straight from the shoulder.
Tho President is to be congratulated.
Peru Republican: We are proud of the
man who has such a wonderful grasp of
national affairs, and especially gratified
that this man is an Indiamau. The mes
sage is comprehensive in its scope, clear in
its statements and statesmanlike in its sug
gestions. ,
Greencastle Sun: President Harrison's
first message to Congress is an able and
statesmanlike document. It indicates that
he has a thorough knowledge of the many
subjects upon which he has touched, and in
the main is independent iu toneand sincere
in purpose. .
Liberty Herald: It is just such a docu
ment as those who know the President best
depended upon a clear-headed, firm, and
yet conservative state paper true to every
American interest, and tne promptings of
a true-hearted, conscientious, patriotic
statesman.
Decatur Journal: It is a message based
npon the everlasting principles of good
government, and has the ring of the true
America:-! spirit a spirit that has made
this cvjnrry what it is. It is simple, yet
philosophical and scholarly. It is a na
tional document and, therefore. Republican.
New Castle Courier: A strong, clear,
statesmanlike document, abounding iu
patriotic suggestions and recommendations
of real, practical reform, where reform is
needed, aud according to Republican ideas
is what the President's message was ex
pected to be and contain, and that is what
it is.
West Lebanon Gazette: The message
shows that the President is awake to the
interests of the covernuient over which he
was selected to rule, and that it is his in
tention to 60 conduct the affairs of the
Nation as to reflect credit to the party
which placed him in power and redound to
the best interests of the whole country.
Corydou Republican: It is able, states
manlike and dignified, but plain and direct
and easily comprehended, couched in words
not too pedantic to bo understod by the
common people. In this respect, as well as
many others, it presents a very favorable
contrast to the official utterance of the
gentleman who is now happily retired into
"innocuous desuetude."
Goshen Times: It is the work of a roan
who feels himself to be a public servant
working under the eye of a most observant
master. The advisory part is told with the
boldness of righteousness. . It is truly Re
publican. It is the voice of an executive
who feels bonnd to execute ihe laws as
they are interpreted by the sense Of the Na
tion which elected him to oflice.
Greencastle Times: The document is one
of the ablest and most masterly of its kind
that has been delivered to Congress in
many years. The fact that the legislative
and executive branches of the government
are in harmony invests the message with
something more than ordinary interest, in
asmuch as there is a likelihood of some of
the recommendations being enacted as
laws.
Frankfort News: It is clean cut, concise
and covers all the questions of vital inter
est to the whole country, sutrirestintr and
advising wholesome legislation in favor of
the poor as well as the rich, the farmers of
t he great Northwest as well as the manu
facturers of the Fast. Aside from his posi
tion relative to the civil-service law the
message meets the unequivocal indorsement
of the Republicans of Indiana.
Lafayette Courier: It is a business-like
document, notably free of partisan spirit
and carefully presenting the honest convic
tions of a high official whoso sincerity in
the work in which he has engaged is so
apparent that in every recommendation
made there is reflected the lofty character
of the man and bis evident desire to servo
the people with the single purpose of the
common good of the whole country.
Seymour Republican: The message is one
that characterizes the man. It is clear,
concise, conclusive controverted questions
receiving especial attention which aro
handled with sound reasoning. Its friends
can justify the logic and rest on the con
clusions of tho instrument. Its distin
guished author has produced a state docu
ment worthy of himself and the country,
as well as the political party he represents.
New Albany Tribune: The message is a
Elain, straight-forward, happily expressed,
usincsslike document It is felicitous in
style, clear in statement, and not so long as
to le unreadable." Yet it gives an ample
and intelligible reviewof tbenational busi
ness. Tbe recommendations are conser
vative, adapted to the times and condition
of the country, and will receive the ap
proval of the best intelligence of the day.
Princeton Clarion: The messago as a
whole is a clear, strong and honest docu
ment. On controverted points it is gener
ally in line with the, proclamation of prin
ciples laid down in the Republican national
platform, and will meet with the favor of
tho ruaiority of the members of the party.
Even those who do not agree with it on
partisan questions will concede that the
utterance is able, vigorous and candid, and
eminently worthy of tho exalted office from
which it emanates.
South Bend Tribune: Its recommenda
tions are in fnll accord with the platform
of the Republican party, and at the same
time are made in tho best inteicstsof the
whole country. He has pointed out an im
portant work for Congress to do, and, as it
is the first time in many years that a Re
publican President has had a Republican
Congress to present his message to, it is to
be hoped that that body will consider Pres
ident Harrison's suggestions and act upon
them for tho best interests of tho whole
country,
Spence's People's Paper: President Har
rison has not deceived the Republicans.
They expet tedan able and digufhVil mes
sage, and he has. given it to the Nation.
The politician who talks tariff from sun
rise to sunset knows now just exactly
where tho President stands. The soldier
will now more fully indorse him mk their
friend, and the colored citizens will hail
him as their Moses to acain h-ad them out
of the wilderness of .Southern oppres&iou.
On every subject the Presidt nt treats of ho
dos it in a manly, 6tatesmau-like and dig
nified manner.
Fort Wayne Gazette: A the first mes
sairo of Prenident Harrison it outlines his
policy, and as an exponent of Republican
principles and doctrines it can go to the
people of tbe country and will receive a
hearty indorsement. The principles enun
ciated are wholesome and in the interest of
good government, and enunciate clearly
the doctrine of the Republican partv of
protection to borne industry, a free ballot
and fair election, equal .justice to all in
short, the United States for her own people
rather than lor the people of any foreign
power or government.'
Logansport Journal: It is a state paper that
is instructive from beginning to end. aud
which should bo read by everv citizen who
loves his country nnd desires to be well in
formed with reference to her public afiairs.
It is an exposition of the doctrines and pol
icies of the Republican partv that will be
1 nroudly accepted and indorsed by the creat
inasses of the party. Turning
away from the unworthy and demoralizing
wraueling over the pottages of patronage.
Republicans should ererwhere rally to
the support of their chief and their repre
sentatives in Congress. , M,
A INtch In the Australian fcyntem.
Philadelphia Press.
Fnll returns of the vote in Massachusetts
show that the Legislature at that State was
wise in deciding to maker tbe first trial of
the Australian system at a Mate election,
when errors would, not cause so much con
fusion or give rise' to contests. There are
some signilicantdiscrepancies in the votine.
which can only be accounted for by the
supposition that the new method was not
well understood. For instance, the total
vote for the different candidates diminishes
just in proportion as their names stood fur
ther down on the list. The vote for Gov
ernor was nearly H.ooo larger than the vote
for Attorney-general. As the Australian
system makes it necessary to place a mark
opposite the name of every candidate voted
for, the only reasonable conclusion is that
several thousand voters were too negligent,
or not well euonah informed, to hx np
their tickets rightly. The practice afforded
by a few State and municipal elections will.,
however, familiarize voters with their new
duty. .
The 1'renident and the Railway Mail Serrica,
Philadelphia North American.
In touching the civil service the Presi
dent explains something that was wrested
to discredit his sincerity eaily in his term.
Referring to President CleveUud's order of
Jan. 4, IStf.t, bringing the railway mail serv
ice under the operation of the law on tho
15th of March then following, he says that
on the 11th of March, Mr. Lvmaii. the only
member of the comnn anion, reported to him
that the list of eligible could not be made
ready before the 1st of May. and reanesteil
tLe postponement of the order until thaC
time, which was done, except in cases when
lists of elicibles micht sooner be obtained.
This clears tbe President of auy imputation
of insincerity, though it was hardly neces
sary to explain iu view of the fact that tho
condition of the railway mail service at
the close of the last administration waa
most deplorable.

Terre Haute Express.
The President best shows his fitness for the
high office to which he was elected when
he treats of tho important affair of the
people. From the day of his nomination
until the election in ovember he almost
daily gave evidence of his mastery of pub
lic questions. In his hrst message to Con
cress his superior ability is acain manifest
ed. There is nothing of the attempt to
lecture the co-ordinate branch of govern
ment, such as made Mr. Cleveland appear
ridiculous: none of the ellort to use catchy
phrases or the personal pronoun. The com-
municanon itiin every resneci appropriate
to the official position of the writer to the
respective importance of various publio
questions, and ail through it there is
digmhed recognition of the relation

The Talk About the Clrll-Serrlce Law.
Boston Advertiser.
The Advertiser does not regard the talk
in Washington about repealing the civil
servico law as anything more than the out
cropping of malice on the part of men who
would rather have their selfish ambition
served by the old patron a ire system than to
have the interests of ' the whole people
served by tho new merit system. The law
will not be repealed. Congress would not
dare to repeal the law if it desired to do so.
and a majority of Congressmen are, we aro
firmly convinced, too wise aud patriotic to
desire to do so. On the contrary, we shall
expect to see every step taken in this mat
ter a step in advance, not in retreat.
A Wise and Con sarra tire Message.
Boston Journal.
President Harrison's treatment of finan
cial and business questions is clear, firm
and wisely conservative. That of the sil
ver question will disappoint those disposed
to attack the Presideut on the ground of
anticipated concessions toward free coin
age. In his recommendations as to pensions,
aid to education, civil service and protec- ,
tion to ballots the President has the conragof
of his convictions. His reference to the'
needs of tho negro is humane, dispassionate
and statesmanlike.

Supreme Bench of thoLnited States. Many,
excellent names have been mentioned foji
the position, but no one deserved the honol '
better than the gentleman upou when)
it has been conferred. Judgo Brewer is it

he will carry to his new duties every quali
fication that insures their conscientious
performance.
Effect of the. Mormon Decision.
Helena (Mont) Journal.
The investigation brought to light ample
evidence that tbe tenets of the Mormon
church were antagonistic to the principles
of our government; that law wasobeycil
only through fear and evaded upon all
possible pretexts: that polygamy is one of.
the principal rocks in the church founda
tion. Judge Anderson weighed the evi
dence and passed judgment. He has re
leased Utah from Mormou rule, it is hoped,
forever.
Not Alarming.
Philadelphia Inquirer.
A band of Anarchists held a meeting

of the Anarchist movement in this coun
try would not bo impetuous enough to
alarm anybedy.
