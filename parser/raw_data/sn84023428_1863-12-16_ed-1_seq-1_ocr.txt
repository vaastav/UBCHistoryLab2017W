' . Notes by The way-side.
The bright sun was just gilding the
tall spire of St. Patrick," and from its
dome cam i forth, full and clear, the mat
in ohue of its hells, striking the hour
of 8'even, as I emerged from the door
ay of a house where 1 had passed the
long hours of the night at the eick bed of
a friend. 1 drew my cloak around mo,
tied mv "Nubia" ticht over mv ears, and
proceeded along the comparatively silent
street to my boarding-place, a few blocks
distant. I walked briskly along, watch
ing the various shopmen, as one after
another they removed the shutters, and
rearranged for the day's display, the va
rious articles of finerey which their win
dows contained ; but they failed to inter
est, and my' eyes wandered off to the dis
tance, where through the bright autumn
foliage, I caught glimpses of the noble
old stone mansions and palaces of the
rich and noble, surrounded by their ex
tensive parks where among the many tint
ed leaves which strewed th turf, the gen
tle deer, just opening their bright eyes
to greet the morning, sported and gambol
ed among the flowers,' and sunshine; I
felt in heart the stirrings of envy, and I
wondered, could Paradise have been more
sweetly beautiful ; when between me and
my fairy vision .loomed up the Court
House and I noticed that there hud al
ready begun to assemble, crowds of men
eager to hear every iota of the impending
trial of a man for the murder of a wom
an and three children. - This doomed
man's home was in one of those same
princely palaces; wealth , rolled in
streams at his feet, but alas, even into
Eden, sin entered, and left his slimy
trail on every shrub and flower,- even so
into the beautiful home of the rich man
the Devil entered, aud he fell!
Shuddcringly I turned away, and my
eye fell upon the dark robed furm of a
'sisterof charity," just emerging from
one of those low white-washed cottages
which are thickly interspersed over the
city, and which are inhabited by the
more respectable class of the poor, and
whose low humble walls in contrast with
the homes before mentioned, seem to
whisper distinctly in one's ear the wordb
of our Lord, " The poor ye have always
with you." As she passed me, I looked
in her face, almost expecting to seo gleams
of celestial glory encircling her, but I saw
only the faded brow bound round by the
white 'kerchief and the black veil and
gown of her order, and from my inmost
heart I said " God bless thee, Sister of
Charity.' " Roman Catholic though they
are, I would give honor to whr.ru honor
is due, and I believe hearts true and wom
anly, beat in their breasts, prompting to
deeds st which angels might not blush;
entering the chambers of sickucss, and
pestilence, moistening . the feverish lips,
and aching brow, in silence closing the
eyes of tho dead, raising the languid
head their presence falls on many hearths
like sunshine on the walls of ,a prison.
Blessed are the "Sisters of Charity."
Though I speak with the tongues of
men, and of angels, and have not chari-
" ... i . j
ty; I am become as sounding Drags ana
tinkling cymbal."
" I cannot eat it Mother, it isn't good.
but i am very hungry, I am." I turned
in the direction from which the voice pro
ceeded, and saw that it came through the
broken panes of a low cellar window at
my feet, and a soft trembling voice an
swered " well, my angel, if Toronto will Af
ford bread, you shall have it,"; the door
opened, and a woman ascended the stairs
leading . to the street, and passed me
quickly; a few steps down the walk .1
' . ';
saw her stop before the open windows of
5 baker's shop and taking a loaf of bread
turned to retrace her , steps, when' the
heavy hand of fi policeman fell upon her
shoulder. ' 1 $h dropped this loaf as the

assisted." , This was a severo rebuff. but!wbo11? -interesting to your readers. But
I felt that the case demanded all my pow
ers of persuasion, else the child might be
left to starve alone.
" At least" said I " if I cannot per
suade you, come with me to her home.
It is only a few steps, and as I pointed out
the place " ; he consented, and as the
poor woman pushed open tho rickety door
and displayed to our eyes the low cellar
room, and its contents, the man started
with surprise. The floor was faultlessly
clean, and the room was lighted by two
small windows opening even with the
pavement, and contained no furniture save
at one end of what appeared to be an old
packing-box set up on end to serve for a
table, to hold two or three coverless books
and a large Bible. The walls were damp
and black with mildew, and no fire though
the day was cold. In one corner least ex
posed to the wind fiom the door and win
dows, stood one of those old fashioned
bed-steuds made like a camp-slool, to open
or shut at pleasure, and on this, without
mattress or covering save a thin worn
quilt, lay a girl of about sixteen years of
age, dying of consumption, the transpar
ent 6kin barely held the large blue eyes
in their sockets, and tho spirit looking
out through them from its skeleton prison
bouse was struggling painfully for release.
She raised her thin hands quickly, and
grasped the bread, eating heartily. It
was a death-hunger, for she soon fell back
exhausted, and a fit of coughing came on
und as it ceased, we heard the death-rattle
in her throat, I saw the gasp, and,
she ceased to breathe. Meanwhile I had
not noticed the policeman, who stood by
the window, his back towards us, but as
he turned to leave the house, I saw a
bright drop fall upon the gilt buttons of
his coat, and then another, as he laid a
five pound note on the open Bible, and
stepped into the street. I now for the
first time addressed the woman, and learn
ed from her, her sad story. She was a Ger
man by birth, of good parentage and
well educated; but being left a widow
without means of support, she had come
with her only child to America to seek a
living by teaching musio. The daughter
was frail, and us she drew on toward
womanhood her strength decreased until
consumption settled upon her, and forced
the mother to quit her employment to at
tend upon her child ; exposure, fatigue,
and over exertion, brought on parylsis
and the right arm of the mother became
useless. Books, music, and musical in
struments all went for food and rent; and
when uo more remained, they had remov
ed to the cellar to starve in silence, and
alone. Poor woman t as she bent above
the remains of the last link which bound
her love to earth. She f pressed the life
less head to her bosom, and meekly bowed
her own and murmered, "father I thank ,
tlipf. " 1 All wns ini)ril now ! th bone,
the four, and the sorrow. ; all the dull
deep pain, and the constant anguish of
patience ; all was over. The : bells of
the city were ringing the hour of noon,
as 1 stepped once more into the crowded
street, and swept onward by the surging
muss. I had small chance to moralize,
j 'but t could; hut blessed be death j
.!... it Ar.n ontox nihora. if 11 VS more

Washington, U. V., Deo. 6th, 1863,
Mr. EniTOR : It being my fortune to'
be detained in this city for a few weeks,
just at this time, when Congress is to meet

as congress does not meet until to-morrow,
it will be necessary to compile my present
letter from outside matters.
I left Chicago, one week ago to night,
and arrived here on the morning of the
first instant, finding the city presenting a
far more lively and business like appear
ance, than it did on my former visit three
months ago.
The president is keeping himself strict
ly out of sight, and is engaged in cora-
pleting his message, which report says
will be quite radical in its character, and
will probably be delivered next Tuesday
morning.
You have undoubtedly heard of Meade's
rccrossing the Uapidan. Probably it will
be stigmatized as another failure, and
many papers are predicting Meade's re
moval thereupon. But there is scarcely a
doubt that this forward , movement of
meade was simply a feint to assist indi
rectly our operations in the vicinity of
Chattanooga, by drawing off Longstreet
from Burnside, aud so compelling Bragg
to fall back toward Dalton. I do not be
lieve from all the information I can gath
er, that Meade's intention contemplated J
any further object than this; except that
in case ho should find by this rcconnoi
sanco iu force, that Lee's poitiou and
force were sneh as to warrant an attack :
then of courne, he was prepared to do so.
So as far as the rumor of Meade's removal
goes, it is simply a supposition of those
who have entirely misconceived the real
intention contemplated by this movement.
And here I bring this introductory epis
tle' to a close. W. E. M.
Dbatu op Major Jarvis. A letter to
the Boston Traveler from Beaufort, N. C,
Dec. 2d, gives this account of the death
of Major Jarvis :
Major Jarvis, of the Ninth Vermont
Infantry Regiment, a part of which is
stationed at Newport Barracks, on the
line of the Beaufort and Newborn Rail
road, was killed by a secesh cavalry man,
yesterday. The Major was in command
of a scouting party, and when in the vi
cinity of Whiteoak Kiver, himself and Or
derly being somewhat in advance of his
party, struck tho trail of horsemen, aud
sodn came in sight of three "cavaliers,"
fleeing for dear life. The Orderly, a mem
ber of the .'id New "York Cavalry, first
overhauled them, and engaged ons, and
the Major soon came to his assistance.
Both parties were firing their pistols at
each other, until the last cartridge was
discharged, during which Major Jarvis
received two bullets, and lived but three
hours after. One of the secesh was killed,
an anttther escaped, and the third, who
I killed the Major, was finally captured by
the N. Y. Cavalry boy John Henry
who commenced the fight 1 he prisoner
said his party had been home on a fur
lough, to a point within our lines, and
were returning to their regiment. Major
Jarvis was an excellent officer, and much

. TUK PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Fellow citizen of the Senate and Houie
of Representatives:
Another year of health and of sufficiently abun
dant harvest has passed : for this, and especial
ly for the improved condition of our national af
fairs, our renewed and profoundest gratitude to 1
God is due. j
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
We remain in peace and friendship with foreign
powers. The eil'orts of disloyal citizens of the
United States to involve us in foreign wars to
aid the insurection at home, have been unavail
ing. Her Britannic majesty's government, as
was justly expected, have exercised their author
ity to prevent the departure of a new hostile ex
pedition from the British ports ; the Emperor of
France has, by a like proceeding, promptly vin- j
dicated his neutra'ity which he proclaimed in the
beginning of the contest.
Questions of great intricacy and importance
have arisen out of the blockade and other belig
erent operations between this government and
several of the maritime powerB, but they have !
been discussed, and as far as was possible, accom- j
modated in a spirit of frankness, justice and mu- i
tual good will. It ii especially gratifying that
our prize courts, by the impartiality of their ad
judications.have commanded the respect and con
fidence of the maritime powers.
The supplementary treaty, between the United
duties ttuu ureav orman ior tne suppression 01
the African slave trade, made on the seventeenth
day of February last, has been duly rattified and
carried into execution ; and it is believed that. so
far as American ports and citizens are concerned,
this inhuman and odious traffic has been brought
to an end.
1 shall submit, for the consideration of the Sen
ate, a proposition for a convention for the adjust
ment of the possessory claims in vVashington ter
ritory, arising out of the treaty of the 15th of
June, 1840, between the United States and Great
Britian, and which have been a source of some
disquiet among the citizens of that rapidly im
proving part of the country.
A novel and important question. Involving the
extent of the maritime jurisdiction ol Spain in
the waterB which surround the island of Cnba,
has been debated without reaching any agree
ment, and it Is proposed, in an amicable spirit, to
refer it to the arbitrament of some friendly pow
er. A convention for that purpose will be sub
mitted to the Senate.
I have thought it proper, subject to the appro
val of the Senate, to concur with interested com
mercial powers in an arrangement for the liqui
dation of the Scheldt dues, upon the principles
which have been heretofore adopted in regard to
imposts upon navigation in the waters of Den
mark. ' The long pending controversy between this gov
ernment and that of Chili touching the sefznre at
Setana in Peru, by the Chillian officers, of a lr.rge
amount in treasure belonging to citizens of the
United States, has been brought to a close by the
award ol his majesty the king of the Belgians, to
whose arbitration the question was referred by
the parties. The subject was thoroughly and pa
tiently examined by that justly respected magis
trate, and, although the sum awarded to the
claimants may uot have been as large as they ex
pected, there is no reason to distrust the wisdom
of his majesty's decision. That decision was
firomptly complied with by Chill when the intel
igence in regard to it reached thut country. The
joint commission under the act of the last ses
sion for carrying Into effect the convention with
Pern on the subject of claims, ' has been organ
ized at Lima, and is engaged in the business en
trusted to it. The difficulties concerning inter
oceanio transit through Nicaragua, are in course
of amicable adjustment. In conformity with the
principle set forth in my last annual message, I
have received a representative from the United
States of Columbia, and have accredited a minis
ter to that republic.
Incidents occurring in the progress of our civil
war have forced npon my Httention the uncertain
state of international questions touching rights
of foreigners.in this country and of United States,
these rights are, at least partially, defined by
treaties ; in no Instance, however, is it expressly
stipulated that. In the event of civil war, a for
eigner residing in this country, within the lines
of the insurgents, is to be exempted trom the
role which classes him as a beligsrent, in whose
behalf the government of this country cannot ex
pect any privileges or immunities distinct from
that character. 1 regret to say however, that such
claims have been put forth, and In some instances
in behalf of foreigners who have lived In the Uni
ted States the greater part of their lives. There
is reason to believe that many persons born in for
eign countries, who have declared the intention
to become citizens, or who have been fully natur
alized, have evaded the military duty required of
them by denying the fact of their residence , and
thereby throwing upon the government the bur
den of proof. It has been found difficult or Im
practicable to obtain this proof, from the wantof
guides to the proper sources of information.
These might be supplied by requiring the clerks
of courts where (he declarations of intention may
be made or naturalization effected, fo send, peri
odically, lists of the names of the persons natur
alized or declaring their' intention to become cit
izens, to the secretary of the interior, in whoe
department those names might be arranged
and printed for general information. There is
also reason to believe that foreigners frequently
become citizens of the United States for the sole
fmrpose of evading the duties imposed by the
aws of their native country, to which on becom
ing naturalized here, they at once repair and
though never returning to the United States,
still claim, as citizens, ihe Interposition of this
government. Many altercations and great preju
dices have heretofore arisen out of this abuse,
and it is therefore, submitted to your serious con
sideration that it might be advisable to fix a limit
beyond which no citizen of the United States,
residing abroad, may claim the interposition of
his government. The right of suffrage has often
been assumed and exercised by aliens under the
pretenses of naturalization, which they have
disavowed when dratted Into military service. I
submit the expediency of such an amendment of
the law as will make the fact of voting an estop
pel against any plea of exemptiin from nillitnrv
serviceorany civil obligation 'on the ground of
alienage.
In common with other western 'powers, our re
lations with Japan have been broucht into seri.
ou jeopardy, through the forcible opposition of
tne nereonary ansuicrawr or tne empire to the
enlightened and liberal riolicy ofthe tycoon, which
was designed to nnng tne counfy into the socie
ty of nations. It isF hoped, however, although
not with entire confidence, that these difficulties
may be peacefully overcome, lask your atten
tion to the claim of the minister residing there
for the damages; he sustained in the deitructinn
by fire of the residence of the legation at Yeddo.
..' Satisfactory arrangements have l een made with
the emperor of Russia, which it is believed. . will
result In effecting a continuous line of telegraph
through that empire from our Pacifle coast. , I
would, recommend to your favorable consideration
the trabjeot of an International telegraph across
the Atlantic ocean, and also of a telegraph be
tween this capital and the national forts along
'the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico.
Such communications, estahllihed with any rea
sonable outlay, would be economical as well as
effective aid to the diplomatic,, military and
.naval service. .....,;,
The consular systemn of the United States, un
der the enactments of the last Congress, begins
to be self.sutaining, and there Is reason to hope
that it may become entirely so with the Increase
of trade which will ensue whenever peace Is re
stored. Our ministers abroad have been faithful
in defending American rights. . In , protecting
j commercial interest, onr twniral have neces.aily
had to encounter increased labors and responsi.
bihties growing out of the war . Thee they
have, for the most part, met and discharged with

TBI TIRBITOBIIS.
The condition of the several organized territo
ries is generally satisfactory, although Indian
troubles in New Mexico have not been entirely
suppressed. The mineral resources of Colorado,
Nevada, Idaho. New Mexico and Arizona, are
proving far richer than has heretofore been un
derstood, and I lay before you a cummunication
upon this subject from the governor of New ilex
ico. t
ENCOURAGEMENT TO IMMIGRATION.
I again submit to yonr consideration the expe
diency of establishing a system for the encour
agement of immigration. Although this source
of national wealth and strength is again flowing
with greater freedom than for several years before'
the insurrection oocurred, there Is still a great
deficiency of laborers In every field of industry.
In our mines, as well of Iron as of the precious
metals. While the demand for labor is thus in
creased here, tens of thousands of persons, des
titute of remunerative occupation, are throng.

BSDRSSS FOR WRONGS TO FOREIGNERS
Injuries, unforseen by the goverment, and un
intended, may In some cases have been inflicted
on the subjects or citizens of foreign countries
both at sea and on land by persons in the service '
of the United States. As this government ex
pects redress irom other powers when similar in
juries are inflicted by persons in their service np
on citizens of the United States, we must be
prepared to do justice to foreigners. If tne ex
istiug judicial tribunals are inadequate to this
purpose, a special court may be authorized with
power to hear and decide such claims, of the
chaiacter referred to, as may have arisen under
treaties and publio law. Conventions, for ad
justing the claims by joint commission, have been
proposed to some governments, but no definite
answer to the proposition has been received
from any. In the course of the session; I shall
probably have occasion to request you to provide
indemnification for these claimants where decrees
of restitution have been awarded by the ordinary
courts, and in other cases, where this government'
may be acknowledged to be liable, in principle,
and where the amount of that liability has
been ascertained by an informal arbitration.
TAXATION OF FOREIGN CONSULS.
The proper officers of the treasury have deemed!
themselves required, by the law of the United .
States npon the subject, to demand a tax upon'
tbe Incomes of foreign consuls in this country.
While such a demand may not,, in strictness be
in derogation of public law, or perhaps of any ex
isting treaty between the United States and a for
eign country, the expediency of so far modifying
the act as to exempt from tax tbe income of such
consuls as are not citizens of the United States,
derived from the emoluments of their office or
from property not situated in the United States,
is submitted to your consideration. 1 make
this suggestion npan the ground that a comity,
which to be reciprocated, exempts onr con
suls, in all other countries, from taxation
to the extent thus indicated. The United States,
I think, ought not to be exceptionally illib,
eral.
TBI FINANCES.
International trade, commerce, and tbe opera
tions of the treasury during the last year nave
been successfully conducted. Th enactment by
Congress of a national banking law has proved a
valuble support of the public credit, and th gen
eral legislation in relation to loans has fully an
swered the expectations of its favorers. Some
amendments may be required to perfect existing
laws, but no change in their principles or general
scope is believed to be needed. Since these
measures have been in operation, all the demand
on the treasury, including th pay of the army
and navy have been promptly met and fully sat
isfied. No considerable body of troops, it is be
lieved, were ever more amply provided for and
mare liberally and punctually paid, and it may
be added that by no people were the burden
incidental to war, ever mare cheerfully borne.
The receipts during the year from all sources, in
cluding loans and the balance in the treasury at
its commencement were $901.125,6T4.86, and it
aggregate disbursements $895, T'J6,630.65, leaving
a balance on the 1st of July, 18C3, of $532,901,
421. Of the receipts, there were received from,
customs, $89,059,642.40; from internal revenue'
$3f ,640,T8T.95 l from tbe direct tax $1,483,103 .
61 ; from sale of lands, $1GT,61T.1T I from mis
cellaneous sources, $3,046,015.85, and from loanr
$TI6,682.S61.5f, making the aggregate $901,1 UoV
674.88. Of the disbursements, there were lor'
the civil service $23.253,922,08 ; for pension
and Indians. $4.210,626.59 1 for interest on pulj
lio debt. $24.T29,846.61 1 for the "war depart
ment, $599,298,600.83 t for the navy depart,
ment, $63,211,105.27, and for the payment of
the funded and temporary debt, 181,086.6S5.0T,
making tbe aggregate $890,796,860.68. and
leaving a balance of $5,329,044.21. But tha
fiayment of the funded and temporary debt havi
ng been made from moneys borrowed during th
year, must be regarded as merely nominal pay'
ments ; and the moneys borrowed to make tnes
payment, as merely nominal receipts, and their
amount $181,086,635.07, should therefore be de
duo ted both from the receipts and disbursement.
This being done there remains as actual receipts
$770,039,039.79, and a actual disbursement
$714,709,905.58. leaving the balance as already
stated. The actual receipt and disbursements
for th first quarter, and the estimated receipt
and disbursements for the remaining three anar
ters of the current fiscal year of 1864 wit) fc
shown in detail by the report of the secretary ef
tbe treasury, to which I invite yonr attentin.
It i sufficient to say here, that it is not believed
that the actual results will exhibit a state ef tht
finances less favorable to the country than the en.
timste of that officer, heretofore submitted,
while It I confidently expected that at the close
of the year both the disbursements and debt Will
be found vary considerably lower tbaa has beta
expected.
TBI WAR REPORT. .
The report of the secretary of war I a docu

bleto make a valuable summary of thi report '

place ; and hence I content myself by asking .
yonr careful attention to be report itself.
