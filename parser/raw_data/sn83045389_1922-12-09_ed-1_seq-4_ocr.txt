"? Some Tilings to Think About
T3 an unrepresentative and dying Con
gress. of whom lew observers now ex
pect more than the passage of the cus
tomary hatch of appropriation bills, the
P re. ill en t yesterday presented a legislative
progyim of nntisnal comprehensiveness. His
awareness that such a message, under the
circumstances, is in the nature of an
anomaly is indicated by his opening sen
tence: "So many problems are calling for
solution that a recital of a 1 i of them, in
the fjtce of the known limitations of a short
session of Congress, would seem to lack
sincerity of purpose,"
Tlicmgh his own recital of problems may
ippear to le;.ve the way open for a charge
3f insincerity?as suggested by himself it
s faj'rer, as well as more respectful, to in
ter that the President has simply chosen
his opportunity for the promulgation of a
tew Ijidministration platform, lie cannot,
?f course, expect the present Congress to
' joniQ to any (inal decision concerning the
i mpefeing assortment of problems which ho
las enumerated; henco his message may
airly be regarded as having been addressed
argqly to the Congress thnt is yet ron
reno- and to tho American people. The j
?Jopt iety of such an exe* utivo discourse '
it any time will hardly be questioned; and.
rertainly, it will not he denied that .Mr. j
Harding has brought out some questions
:oncerning which legislators and public !
ihould be seriously thinking.
Outstanding among the matters upon !
whicyi the message touches are three ex- !
.remely I've subjects: transportation, j
prohibition and agricultural relief. The
}rst lie- pi ~;.'-r!y describes as a "problem d*'- '
nan dine; ' most i ig -tvus consideration "
The chief item of his own program of relief :

rate about 4 M per rent. January 1 each

these certificates Issued and purchased t>y
the whole country was about *626.000.000.
A very considerable volume of these cortill

reason or another, under stress of aftor-the
war necessity, already parted with them.
The post-oHlces and the hanks are co-op

for collection at once in order to avV>id the
confusion that would result if ail certifi
cate holders presented their securities on
the same day. The hanks are offering to
collect the money for the certificates and
give advice relative to Its investment. The
post-offices will arrange to have checks
mailed to those who wish money or they
will exchange the certificates for other gov
ernment securities. An attractive Federal
issue is now in $25. $100 and $1,000 de
nominations. The $L'.r> certificate may he
bought for $20.u0. the $100 denomination
for $S2. and the $1,000 certificate for $S20.
These investments pay out at the rate of

If tho thrift liahit was good during the
stress of war, it is equally good in peace

and reinvest it in sound interest-hearing

"Tinkering Witli tho Constitution"
PRKSIIHKNT HARDING has picked up
the gage of battle thrown to him l?y
tho progressive element within his party.
The challenge Is accepted. The issue, in
volving a sweeping change in the present
election system of the nation, is Joined, and
the fight between the Old Guard, as typified
by the Harding leadership, and the l.a
Toilette forward lookers Is on.
(in the same day. and at almost the same
hour, that a committee of the Senate,
headed by the radical Senator Norris, of
Nebraska, brought forth a report urging
the abolition of the electoral college and
urging further that the President and Vice
President lie inaugurated in January in
stead of in .March, also that Congress con
vene Immediately after each election. Pres
ident Harding authorized the announce
ment that he opposes such institutional
changes. The executive believes that well
enough should be left alone.
Any contest for control. within a party
in power is necessarily a matter of national
interest, but in the present instance the is
sue raised transcends in importance the
future of Air. Harding's leadership or the
success of that of the progressive bloc. It
is now proposed to amend the Constitution
In radical respects and to change the me
rhanics of the existing electoral system of
the country. Such proposals, when serious
ly presented and strongly advocated, be
come a matter of deep concern entirely
apart from party politics.
Thero is. of course, substance to the
argument that Congress and the govern
ment generally are not as responsive to pop
ular sentiment as might be the case. A
President, elected in November, under th?>
present system does not take office until
the succeeding March. A Congress elected
at the same time goes Into office along ;
with tho President, but does not begin to
function until the following December? i
! thirteen months after the election?unless !
called together bv special proclamation of
(lie President. ??' j
Hv this constitutional arrangement a
< otigres.s which may have been repudiated
at the polls still holds on for four months
and may legislate during the whole of that i
time. Likewise a President who may have
been defeated in November continues in
office four months, wielding all the power i
vested In his high office. As a matter of i
pure democracy, this is all wrong. A re- j
gitne which is voted out of power by the i
people Should surrender its commission Itn- j
mediately. To that extent, the program of
the progressives must appeal strongly to j
those who believe firmly in majority rule. '
first, last and all the time.
At 'li.it. the position taken by the Presl- !
dent upon the pending proposals has more j
to support it than the fact that the "found- I
ing fathers" were guided by great wisdom
in their labors or that they were great and
good patriots. Succeeding generations
should revere thes'e strong men and ap
praise carefully their work, but it is not
to be assumed that they were infallible
or that they could look ISO years into the
future and legislate with certainty for 100,
iift0."00 men and women then unborn.
When Mr. Harding insists that a Con
rress should not rush from the heat of an
election to Washington and begin making
laws for the country. |,e is on solid ground
I he blunders that might be made, under
, ?" 'II
' U ? irrtinist.'incw, would h<> almost ir
I >? parable. It is far safer for a new Con
gre?ss to cool off and take a year to con
I s!(ler the needs of the nation, if there is
; any emergency to be met. th? President al
I ways has the power to summon an extra
J r.sslon, a power that has I exercised so
j often in recent years as t? make a sped'-,I
? session, following an election, almost a no
j lit ion 1 certainty.

1 hoy had been taken while; ongagoil in open <
con(Ilot. with the authorities; the fact that
they had since been held in prison could
not bo taken as having mitigated their guilt
it nl Soiled their, altitude or intentions. This,
briefly, was the government's reply. "Timid
creaklngs." as Professor MncNcill described
the protests against the executions, would
not lie permitted to stay the hand of the
government in its purpose to crush tho re
hellion and establish peace ki Ireland. The
cnlv way to meet the situation, declared
President Cosgrave, is "to strike terror to
those responsible."
The sternness with which the new Irish
leaders have taken up thoir task has never
been made clearer. The course they have
set for themselves is not without grave
hazards, but it may not bo forgotten that
upon them rests tho duty of crushing an
outlaw organization.
America's Influence 41s Lausanne
AS the American attitude toward prob
lems under discussion at the Lausanne
conference is elaborated with fuller dellnite
ness as to details by Mr. Child, oiiicial ob
server for the United States, it finds in
creasing respect from the principal powers
represented there. In so far as ihsistenco
upon the safeguarding of American rights
and interests of every kind is concerned,
that attitude may not be described as en
tirely unselfish, but what it demands for
itself in the way of "open door" opportuni
ties is 11?> more than it would have accorded
to all other countries. Otherwise, it holds
true to its traditional humanitarian policy
as of most vital concern in any plan of set
tlement which it seeks to have effected.
In support of this policy, Mr. Child read
a statement to the conference Thursday
strongly protesting against expulsion of the
Creek population from Constantinople. "Wo
will not hesitate," he warned the confer
ence, "to express, in pursuance of our legit
imate humanitarian interests, our protest I
at any such dislodgment of human beings."
The protest made a deep impression on
the conference and. subsequently, the rep
resentatives ?>f France, KnglautI and Italy
joined in the discussion and strongly ad
vised the Turkish dele??Ates to change thoir
minds about sending the Greeks away from
Constantinople, pointing out that Turkish
insistence on such deportation would en
danger the entire negotiations relative to
the exchange of populations and prisoners
of war. j
This reflects only one phase of the no- j
goliations in which the soundness of Amer- 1
ienn contentions has received recognition
and has exerted a strong moral influence
in bringing the principal allied powers Into
accord on a unified plan of settlement of ;
vital issues to which eventually the Turks j
must accede, or else accept the consequences |
of a breakdown of negotiations. In this j
connection, no little credit is due to Mus
solini, the Italian Premier, for frank ex- j
pressions and wholesomeliess of attitude
'hat have contributed 110 little to, the allied
accord that has been attained In presenting
a solid front to the sirrogancy of the Turks.
"Italy, in tho negotiations at Lausanne, i-?
in full agreement with allies," said tho ;
Italian Premier upon the eve of his de- ,
parture for Paris Thursday night. "What |
we propose to the Turks is perfectly reason- j
able. 1 hope the negotiations are success
ful; otherwise there will be war."
That Is the kind of talk that will make |
the Turks sit up and lake notice. Whtl".
as previously indicated-, the moral influence
that America is able to exert at the confer
ence has proven to be valuable, its position
ii> determining its successful outcome is
substantially weakened by refusal to ac
cept its share of responsibility for carry- ,
;ng the plans which i'> advises into effort.

Mr. Harding talks to our "lame duck" Con- i
