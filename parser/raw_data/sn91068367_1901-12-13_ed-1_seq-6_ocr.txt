Pnlxon Quarptlnes Asainst Mount
Olive and Other Infected Sections.
. (Correspondence of The Messengrer.)
Falson, N. C, December 9.
The town, authorities of Falson have
-t last quarantined against the small
pox infected section of Mt. Olive and
vicinity, where there has been small
pox for six or eight months without
proper vaccination, disinfection and
quarantine, as stated by residents of
that section, and The Mt. Olive Ader-
tlser. This infection has been carried
into Duplin - and Sampson counties
where there are cases seriously sick
. now.
Every section infected with smallpox
should immediately stamp it out, as
proper and full legal authority has been
given by the laws of our state, so that
adjoining sections and towns will not
be molested with such dreaded diseases.
Failure for months on the part of such
towns or county sections will necesitate
strict quarantine, as it Is better and
- cheaper to prevent its coming than to
take care of it after Its appearance.
Our town and section has been abso
lutely free from smallpox and .we com
mend our authorities in their efforts to
keen us free.
The McMullen-Miller Lumber Compa
ny, working 200 to 300 hands dally at
their mills and woods camps, has like
wise quarantined against smallpox and
keep guards out at their own expense
- and do not allow "strangers within tnelr
Let" our neighbors do by us as they
would be done by and quarantines
would be unnecessary, but self protec
tion compells us to this action, howey
. er. much we regTet the necessity for it.

Rocky Mount. N. C, December 10.
Rocky Mount is certainly one of the
most progressive towns In the state.
Beautifully situated in one of the
healthiest sections of North Carolina;
-surrounded by fine lands for producing
tobacco, cotton ana a, sren. cjr
other crops; at one of the divisions, and
' at which are located the branch shops
vof the great Atlantic Coast Line sys
tem, there is no reason why its progress
flhould not continue till it becomes a
town much larger than it is at present
and one of the principal cities In. the
state. At present there are many new
residences and business houses being
built. A sewerage system has recently
been completed, and electric piam auu
edand progres is manifest on every
hand. m ,
tvio otnhHhment of one or iti
branch shops here of the Atlantic Coast
Line has greatly increased me ousmwa
and population of Rocky Mount, and
4Vt oyi i not vet: for the shops are be
ing constantly enlarged as the business
of this great railway increases.
Among other additions to Rocky
Mount in the way of buildings recently
I will mention the new Hotel Aiarriott.

one of the Atlantic Coast Line's most
popular young conductors, has retired

Kennnsvlllo Notes
(Correspondence of the Messenger.)
Kenansville, December 10.
Your correspondent is gratified at the
progress being made with the fireproof
, county offices. They will soon be ready
for use. Judging from the vigor with
which the work is being pressed.
The James Sprunt Institute, or rather
the teachers and students thereof, gave
a brilliant recital during last week.
Your correspondent was slighted or ig
nored, and knew nothing of it till t'was
all over, or he might come nearer doing
the subject Justice. He learns, however,
that all went as merry as a marriage
bell and that t'was a complete success
in every particular.
Apropos of an article that appeared
in The Messenger a few days ago refer
ring to the distress of the farmers, I
hear of a number of instances in which
the landlords have refused to take any
rent from their distressed tenants. I
earnestly hope that such a state of
things is not confined to this section,
but that it is contagious, and will
spread everywhere.
MISS VOPPAN AltKAlGXEIi
On Indlctmouts Cbarirlntr Murder of
Three Persons
Barnstable, Mass., December 6. Miss
Jane Toppan. of Lowell, stood up in
the superior court room late this after
noon "and heard the grand Jury's in--vdictmeni
charging her with the murder
bt three persons whom she had been
who had died under her charge, and,
according to the Indictment, by her
hand. The indictments charge her
-with the death of Mrs. Mary D. Gibbs,
of A. P. Davis, both of Cataumet, and
of Mrs. Genevieve A. Gordon, of Chi
cago. For ten minutes the woman stood
tightly clutching the rail while the
clerk read the indictment charging her
with the murder of Mrs. Gibbs. At
length Miss Toppan's counsel spared
her further agony by waiving the read
ing, and all that remained was for her
to plead- Three times she was asked
if she was guilty of the murder, and
three times she replied in a low Voice
"not guilty."
Miss Topcan then was led away to
her 'cell, v; here she will remain until
some time early next spring, when she
will be given a trial by Jury.

New York, December 7. The chair
man of the Railroad Passenger Asso

what is known as the railroad ticket

sive campaign to prevent the traveling
public from being imposed on by the
ticket scalpers or persons engaged in
fixing, altering or manipulating rail

Jimmy Heath, the old war veteran,
breaking his hip. about a week ago,
died at Marion, S. C, yesterday. Mr.
Tucker left to evade arrest and had
not been heard from since his departure.

presented by the grand jury, superior
court being in session at the time the
offense was committed, and a capias
was issued for him.
The board of aldermen convened in
special session last night to consider
bids for sites for city hall and market
house. Several bids were received, off
ering sites in the various part of the
city. The board took no action, pre
ferring to go slowly and consider the
matter cautiously. It was the sense of
the board that the market and the city
headquarters be built separately.
Mr. D. MacN. Mackay, of Dunn, has
purchased the entire stock of drugs be

The debate In the house will be brief,
probably not exceeding a day. with a
special rule providing for bringing the

CARNEGICS PROPOSITI) CSIFT.
A University Not Contemplated A
Fund for Aid of Certain Students.
Washington, December 10. The pro
posed gift of $10,000,000 by Andrew Car
negie for educational purposes was dis
cussed at today's meeting of the cabi
net. It was stated after the meeting
that the president had received a com
munication from Mr. Carnegie on the
subject of the creation of a fund for the
extension of higher education.
It is said that his proposition does
not involve the establishment of uni
versity buildings in Washington, but
rather the placing of a fund in the
hands of government trustees from
which the expenses of deserving stu
dents may be paid In the line of origi
nal investigation at home or abroad.
The proposition, it is understood, had
not reached a concrete form except in
general terms and except as to the
amount.
The president will confer with mem
bers of congress in regard to the pro
posed gift before making it public.

A FEARFUL EXPLOSION'
CmiNed by Molten Metal CoraiiiK in
Contact With Water.
Sharon, Pa., December 10. An explo
sion that shook the earth for miles
around, shattered windows in hundreds
of houses at South Sharon, moved ad
jacent buildings from their foundations
and caused the injury of nine men, two
perhaps fatally, occurred at the Sharon
Steel Company's plant today.
The explanation occurred in the cast
ing department or "pig mill". The metal
was being poured from the ladle Into
the casting machine when it came in
contact with some water, which caused
a blast that was felt a distance. The
casting house was completely wrecked.
Large strips of heavy corrugated Iron
beams and other materials were hurled
hundreds of yards by the explosion. The
casting machine and conveyor were
damaged almost beyond repair A part
of the conveyor was blown several hun
dred feet, while not a vestage of the
iron roof of the mill remains. Windows
in the office of the steel company on
Broadway, several hundred yards away
from the explosion were broken and In
Sharon and South Sharon the shock
was felt like an earthquake. Secretary
Whitla, of the steel company states to
night that he was unable to give an ex
planation of the cause of the accident.
