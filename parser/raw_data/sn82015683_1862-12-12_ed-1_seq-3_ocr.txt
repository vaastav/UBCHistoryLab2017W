Tnr. Writ or Rksimtion. A very Important
hibei corpu cae was argued jenterday before
the full bench of the Sujreme Court, and their
de i.-ion upon it will te had to dar. A man

of Pennsylvania, i harge! with leing et.eaged in
n robtery at Pdtburg, on ihe 2Cth day of Novem
ber 1 it. Many perion here were willing to
nweir poitively tint O'Malley wa in the citv of
Indian ipoli on" that and the ueeeeding day. The
i-.;!et lawyer at the bar were retained on both
,.ide-bv O'Malley and by the officers from
Penn Ivani i wlio caine here for the pi isoner. A
wtit of h il.c i corpu was obtained from the Su
preme Court, and j e-terday the cae wa very
ably argueil by Hm. 1 ho ma A. Hendricka for
the prisoner, and Hon. Jo-enh K. McDonald for
the accusing partiei. The question of the pow
er nnd juridictior. of the Court was very fully
dicQ-ed, hut the oiiits submitted, and upon
which the cae will probably be decided, was the
Miflicii-riey of ihe pipers.
Mr. MrD inald eontendc! that the case was
only a f ttper cte, atid the (Viurt had no power to
go behind the document upon which the Kiecn
tive had acte 1.
Mr Hendricks alleged that the papers were in-snf?ii.-ient.
The adidivit upon wh'uh they weie
ba-ed did not charge any distinct offense. He
ulo contended that the Court was competent to
examine thefit whether or not the prisoner w as I
a fugitive ftoin ju-ttre und the ju-dice that pur
suel n p irticular ollen.-e. If this could not be
examined here, where could it be eiamined? Not
nt Pitt -burg, where the man would be put upon
his trial for the cttme without a question us to
his being a fugitive being raited.
1 he Court at a late hour named 1 o'clock to
dav for tlie further eoniIeration of ihe case.
The ijue-lion of biil then came tip, nnd the
Court, without the examination of nuthoritie.
refu.-ed to t ke bail, and remanded the prisoner
to the cu-Unly of the SherifT, with an mtim ition
to th it oflu-er tint he could be kept without being
locked up.

corntdeied.
Ti e i tiemy has used very Utile atbKery tip to
thi t:uie, m il would endanger iheir own men
whoaie ho!d.i,g the river front.
Rurns'ide ha just i-sued au order to concentrate
everr available tun upon the citv, under cover
of the fire of which it is believed the bridge can
be finished.
The killed ami wuunded d-j cot amount to orer
J0 men.
Klivlx o'clock P. M Rut little firing took
pbi-e beiween 1 and 2 o'clock, duiing which ticio
all the available bvtterie were placed in position.

their hiding places. The hot nnd hell went
thiou-h the houses, in many cases setting thetn
n fire and causing a dene tmoke, which, to
gether with the explosion of so Ure a quantity
of towdcr. almost hid the city from riew.
It oti became evident that ;Le bridge cou!d i
not be built except by a bold cfah. Volunteers
were cal'e.1 for to croj in small boats. - The or
der wa no sooner pven thin hundred stepped
forwanl; but all could not go; about 100 were
selected. They were soon on their way, while
the attillery threw a perfect shower of iron hail
on the rri-ite b ink. Thev reiche? 1 the opposite j

they tu died upon the enemy, kdiing several and i

this side. I
At h df pst two the lrides were fmlelieil op- j
po-ite thecily, when the trops immediately be- j
g an to cross over. The enemy were soon driven
from the e ty luck to their line of work j
The two bridges in front of Gen. Franklin were !
succe-sfully lid eily in the day, but his troops
did not cro5 until the two upper ones were ready.
A sufficient force i now on the opposite eitle

The retels fired but few guns in the morning
and no:;e in the alternoon, although their wotk
were in easy range.
During the forenoon ihe releU burned tlie
railroad bridge outside of ihe city.
Retween 30 and 10 house were burned, mostly
in the business part of the city.
During the day betw een ,000 and 9 ,UX) rounds
were fired by our artillery.
Everything is quiet to night. The indications
are that a battle will be fought to-morrow.

AVasiii.ngtox, December 11.
Sexatk Messrs. Hale and Sumner pie
sented petition protesting against the action of
tlie Adrisory Hoard of the Navy.
Meters King, 1'omeroy and Howard presented
petitions in favor ot a genera! bankrupt act.
Mr. Rrowtiii g iuttoduced a bill to amend the
act establishing the Territorial Government of
Utah, and to facilitate the administration of jus
tice iu said Territory. Referred to the Judiciary
Committee. A me-s age wa received faotn the President
recommending a vote of thanks to Lieut. G. V.
Morris, for the determined valor and heroi-m he
displayed in defense of the loop of-war Cumber
land against the rebel in n clad Mernmac. Also
recommending a vole of thanks to Lieut. 0. L
Worden, lor ihe skill and gallantry exhibited by
Iii in in tlie battle betw een the Monitor and the
rebel steamer Meniniic. Referred lo the Naval
Committee.
A communication was also received from the
President answering a tesolution of the Senate
calling for information and evidence relative to
the Indian barbarities in Minnesota. Ordered to
be primed.
The resolution relative to the arbitrary arrests
of crt tin citizens of Delaware was taken up.
Mr. Morrill contended that the resolution, as it
now stood, was not a resolution of inquiry, but a
charge a;uin-t ihe Govemmentand an indictment
against the President, and he hhould vote for no
such resolution. He claimed that in this state of
war and rebellion, with the hind full of traitors
and spies the Commander-in-Chief has the tij;ht
to arrest stich men.
No one, not even the Senator from Delaware,
(Saul-bury) has claimed that the.-e men were
loval. That Senator (Powell) had denounced
tiie Government from the beginning, thcsime as
his colleague, who followed the I gloal result of
his reasoning and went into the lebel army bu'
not a single word does the Senator (Powell)
oiler against the rebels, and rejoices ov er tho le
cent elections, and saya the lion hearted Democ
racy nre rebuking tliis Administration. Well,
every rebel throughout rebeldom rejoices iu the
same way. It is 6iiposel there will be n peace
party at the Nc-ith that will force this Gov ernment
into an ingloiiou. peace, and that party encour
aged Jeff. Davis and foreign countries In their
tu hemes of intervention.
There ought to be some proof that these men
were loyal.
Mr. Morrill contended that there was no ground
for comp!. tint that men were arrested on suspicion.
Men were always arrested upon suspicion of
crime.
Mr. Weight moved to amend, the resolution so
as lo make the call noon the President instead of
the Secretary of War.
Mr. Wright said he knew no in.m w ho w is per
mitted to live iu the South w ho ha any sympathy
with the North. He would hvve to se3 some of
the spirit ehow n by Stotiewtll Jackson when he
fonnd fotty sev en of his men skedaddling ftoin
the battle. He m irehed them in front of the
regiment and had every in in of them shot. In
stead ol this, we have propositions for conven
tions, kr. He wot. Id htand by ihe Government
and ihe President. Ho would have the ttower of
the Government felt by every traibir North an J
South.
Mr. Riyard argued at length to show the a flairs
id the S:ate of Delaware, and that true loyalty
to the country did not imply loyalty to a single
individn i.
Mr. Powell said the President had violated the
Constitution, nnd he was reidy to prove it. He
did not believe thi Union could ever he rcstoied
by force of arm. He contended that President
Lincoln had violated the Constitution iu enlarg
ing the regular army, iu the suspension of tho
writ of habe is corpus, iu arresting citizens, in
interfering with the freedom of the prc.-s, and iu
his recent proclamation.
Mr. Fessendcii was willing to admit that some
thing had been done apparently without liw; but
does any oie doubt the patriotism of the Presi
dent? doe? any one pretend thtt he h is not done
what lie thought btvt to suppress this rebellion
and preserve the country, or tint he Ins wilfully
viol tied the rights of any citizen?
At 1 o'clock A. M. the Senate hail not ad
journed. Hois.;- Mr Roseoe Conklin asked leive to re
j)i t a bill to establish a uniform system of batik
tuple
Mr. Ye.it-ne:i otTered the following, to be laid
over for Inline consideration:
llrsolrcd by the House of Representatives, the
Sen ate, concurring, That the proclatn itiori of the
President, of the 22d of September, ltGi, is not
warranted by the Constitution
littnlrid, That notice of cm tricipation, a in
dic itel iu the prod mi it'"n as well calculate! to
hasten the restoration of peice, is not well chosen
as a measure, and is an assumption of power dan
gerous to the lights of cit'zen and the perpetuity
of a free Government.
Mr. Lovcjov moved to lay the resolution on
the t tble. Carried, by 94 against 15.
Tho House then went into Cmnnittee of the
Whole on ihe President's message.
Mr. Hutchins spoke at length, taking for a text
lliat freedom and slavery weie incompatible be
yond hope of reconsideration or compromise.
Mr. Menies. replying, said he was in the habit
of regarding ihe enemies of the pioclamation as
the friends of the Constitution. He understood
the genllem m from Ohio (Mr. Hutchin) to be
opposed U the Union as it w.i. No doubt the
reason i i-nel by him for the recent defeat of
tha Republicans were satisfactory to the gentle
man hiui-e'l, but he ineie'y would tell them that
the iiMstcrs to that party were attributable to the
Abolition programme of the Paesident aud his
puty.
