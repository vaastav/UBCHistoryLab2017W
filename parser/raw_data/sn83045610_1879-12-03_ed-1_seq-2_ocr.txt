APPRENTICES.
The apprentice system is viitnallya
thing of the past. In the United
States it is dead and buried beyond
the hope of resurrection, an l in Eng- :
land it is much the same. Under the
circumstances it coal I not be other- 1
wise. The apprentice system was an '
outgrowth of tho shop. The cooper,
the printer, the blacksmith, &c , took
a boy into the trade because he couldn't
afford to hire a man ; usually getting
the services of tho boy for no
thing, and occasionally receiving com
pensation in addition. Seventy years
ago Napoleon truly denominated the
English a nation of shopkeepers, and
America was another. Among such
people apprentices were indispensable.
That day, however, has gone past, and
ia its place has coaie the reigu of steam
aud electricity. Boys can DO lenger be
utilized, aud men are abaelutely re
quired. On the locomotive and train,
in tbe mammoth factory, in the coun
ting room, every persoo must know bis
place and be able to fill it. We no
longer, min the slow days of half a
century ago, have time to stop and
teaoh as wo work, and the baud who
requires such teaching is certain to be
the one first discharged. The ooly
waj on this coast for a boy nowadays
to learn a trsde is to pick it up. He
can hang arouud, use tbe keenest ob
servation of which he is capable, and
make himself useful as his inclination,
ability and limited opportunities will
permit. In the lapse of years, and
after oft repeated rebuffs and discour
agements, he finds a place he can fill,
and if there is good stuff in him he
quiekly fits himself for any place in the
business or any branch of tbe trade.
Ou tbe Atlantic, it is not very dif
ferent or much better, and in England
likewise. In Franco, where tbe same
trouble has been encountered, a step in
tho right direction has been takep.
Sohools there bavo been instituted to
the number of two hundred and forty,
for the scientific and mechanical educa
tion of tho youth, and in this has been
found the desired remedy. Book-keep
ers, druggists, engineers, printors, glass
and iron workers, engravers, jewelers,
wood workers, cotton spinners, silk
spinners and weavers, and a great
many others learn their trades, and
learn them well, in these schools. The
whole time of the youth is not taken
up in work, but several hours each day
are devoted to study, particularly that
line of study that will tend to increaso
their knowledge of tbe trado they are
engaged in learning. For the gradu
ates of these schools there is a demand
at onoe, the best wages are offered, and
tke moat desirable positions are open.
They are young and intelligent, are
accustomed to work, bavo bad their
ambitions stimulated, and they have in
the past acquittid themselves most
satisfactorily. In Paris alone 31,000
minora are now employed, uotjone-half
of whom have completed their school
eouree, owing to the demand for the
services of just such persons, and half
time sohools are being established to
enable them to ooaplete their educa
tion after working hours. In tbe United
States we have the same problem to
grapple with, and we will have to seek
its solution in tbe same way. There is
no other conrse to purswe, aud our sg
ricultural colleges, our training ships,
oar busineas schools, Afi, indicate that
that eolation is gradually and certainly
finding adoption among ui.
THE DUO.
Aooording to a noted Spiritualist,
who recently lectured in San Francisco,
we are placed on this earth not to pre*
pare for death but for life, and those
who live aright will be always pr«f*r«d
for death. With a human being there
is no such thing U annihilation. What
ia called dying among us is only the
•ffort of the soul to break away from
earthly barriers. The body ia a shell,
and what hatching ia to tba bird dying
is to tba confined sou). Death, tha
speaker aaid, ia to be compared to a
second birth from the corruptible
body into the shining realms of immor
tality. and tba moral conduct of this
life determines the immediate condition
of a future existence. There sre differ
eat jooeditions of suffering end happi-
DMS in the epirit world. Tha more
pure a person livea here, the greater
will be the degree of blias hereafter.
Infants sre received at death by tender,
loving angels, wbo bear them to a
sphere of innocepce and purity, where
they are educated by the angels of God.
Suicide i> ft cowardly act, and beneflta
not the one oemmitting it. Each ha
■aft being, no matter what his trials or
afliotkma, is expected to live to e good
old age and ripen gradually tor the
bettor land. Memory and consciousness

wicked snter the lower realms of dark-
ness, the iie!l» of Swedccbjrg. No
one hire is perfect; none are saints.
The future world is one of reality, with
fruits, fields, forests, gar lens and every*
thing to attract and enchant the mortal.
Congenial souls there meet, know each
other and have cognizance of tbe needs
of those left on earth. This belief is
as pretty as it is rational.
THE PRESIDENTS IGE.
The following arc the opening para
graphs of the Message of President
Hayes, delivered to Congress on Mon
day, the Ist instant:
FeUxrtr citizen* of the .Senate arul 11 in*
of JteyntntHizu: The members of the
Forty-sixth Congress have assembled
in their first regular session under cir
cumstances calling fur mutual congrat
ulations and grateful acknowledgment
to the liivtr cf all good for the larg*
aud unusual measure of national pros
perity which we enjoy.
NATIONAL FINANCES.
The most important events which
have occurred in <ur public affairs
since my last annual message to Con
gress are connected with the financial
operations of the Government, directly
affecting tbe business interests of the
country. I congratulste Congress on
tbe successful execution of the resump
tion act. At the time fixed and in the
manner contemplatod by law U. 8 notes
began to be redeemed in gold coin.
Since the first of January last they have
been promptly redeemed on presenta
tion, and in all business transactions,
public or private, in all parts ef the
country they are received and paid out
as the equivalent of coin. The demand
upon tbe Treasury for gold and silver
iu exchange for U. S. notes has been
comparatively small, and tbe voloitary
deposit of ooin and bullion iu exchange
t(ft notes has been very large. The ex
cess of the precious metals deposited or
exchanged for U. S. notes over the
amount of U. S, notes redeemed is
about $40,000,000.
The resumption of specie payment
has been followed by a very great re
vival of business. With a currency
equivalent in value to the money of the
commeroislyworld, we are enabled to
enter upon an equal competition with
other aations in trade and production.
The increasing foreign demand for our
manufactures and agricultural products
has caused a large balance of trade in
our favor, wbioh bas beeu paid in gold
from tbe first of July last to November
15th, to tbe amoant of about $09,000,-
000. Since tbe resumption of specie
payments there has been a marked and
gratifying improvement of tbe public
credit. The bonds of the Government
bearing only four per cent- interest,
have been sold at or above par, sufficient
to pay off that part of the national debt
which was redeemable under present
laws. The amount of interest saved
annually by tbe process of refunding
the debt since March Ist, 1877, is $14,-
297,177. Tbe bouds sold wero largely
in small sums and tbe number of our
citizens cow holding the public securi
ties is much greater than ever before.
Tbe amount ef natioual debt which
matures within less than two years is
8729,121,700, of which *500.000,0C0
bears interest at the rate of fiv; per
cent. It is believed that this part of the
public debt can be refunded by the is
sue of four per cent, bonds; aud by the
reduction of interest which will thus
be effected, about $11,000,003 can bo
annually saved to tbe Treasury. To se
cure this important reduction ot interest
to bo paid by tbe Unitod State*, fait her
legislation is required which it is hoped
will be provided by Congrcs* during its
present session.
The coinage of gold by tho mints ol
tho United States during the last fiscal
year was 890.080,012. The coinage of
silver dollars ciucc tho passage of the
act for that purpose up to November 1,
1879, was 145,300,850, of which $12.-
900,344 have been issued from the
Treasury and are r.ow in circulation,
and $32,300,500 are still in the posses
sion of tbe Government.
The peudenoy of tbo proposition lur
unity of action between the United
States and the priueipal commercial na
tions of Europe to effect a permanent
system fer the equality of gold and sil
ver aa tbe recognized money of the
world, leads me to reccommond that
Congress refrain from new legislation
on tbe general subject. The great re
vival of trade, internal aud foreign, will
supply during the coming year its own
instructions, which may well be awaited
before attempting further experimental
measures with the coinage.
1 would, however, strongly urge upon
Congrats the importance of authoriz
ing the Seoretary of the Treasury to
suspend the coinage of silver dollars
upon the proseut legal ratio. The
market value of the silver dollar being
uniformly and largely less than the
market value of the gold dollar, it is
obviously impracticable to main tain
them at par with each other if both
are coined without limit. If the cheap
er coin is forced into circulation, it
will, if coined without limit, soon be
come the sole standard of value, ar.d
tlius (be Jc.-itw)
is that the curreucv of both gold and
silver shall be of equivalent value,
dollar for dollar, with the universally
recognised money of the world Tha
retirement from circulation of United
States notes with capacity of I gal ten
der m private oootraota is a step to be
taken in our progress toward a safe
and staple currency which should be
accepted as the policy and duty of the
Government aud the interest and secu
rity of the people It is my firm con
viction that the issue of legal tender
paper mouey, based wholly upon the
authority and credit of the Government,
except m extreme urgency, is without
warranty ot the constitution and a vio
lation of sound financial principles.
The issue of UuiUd States notes during
the lata civil war, with the capacity of
legal tender between private individ
uals, was unauthorized except as a
means of rescuing the country from
imminent peril. The circulation of
these notes as paper money for any
protracted period o( time after the ac
complishment of this purpose w»s not
contemplated by the framers of the
law under ahich they were issued.
They antioipated the redemption and
withdrawal of these notes at the earliest
practicable period consistent with the
attainment of the object for which
they were provided The policy of the
United States, ateadily adhered to from
the adoption of the constitution, has
been to avoid the creation of a national
debt, and whan, torn necemity in the
time of war, dtbts have been created,
they Lave been paid eff on the return
of peace as rapidly as possible. With
this view and fur this purpose it is
recommended thai the exiting laws
for accumalation of a sinking fund
sufficient to extinguish the public debt
within a limited period be maintained.
If any change of the cbjtcts or rates ol
taxation is tecessary by Con
gress, it is suggested that experience
has shown that a duty can be placed
on tea and Coffee, which will not er<*
hance tbe price of those articles to the
consumer and wiil aid several miliioc3
of dollars annually to the Treasury.
THE SUPPRESSION OF POLYGAMY
The continued and deliberate viola
tion by a large number of the promi
nent and influential citizens of the
Territory of Utah, of th* laws of the
United Mates, for tho pron-cuti >n ar. 1
punishment of polygamy, demand? the
attention of every department of the
Government This Territory has a
population suflieie.Jt to entitle it to ad
mission as a State, an 1 tbe general in
terests of the nation aad Territory
require its advance from tbo Territorial
form of government to the
ties and privileges of* a State. This
important change will not, however,
be approved by the country while the
citizens of Utah, in very considerable
number, uphold a practice which is con
detuned as a crime by tho laws of all
civilized communities throughout the
world The law for tho suppression of
thii offence was enacted with greit un
animity by Congress more
ye.ira ago, but has remained until re
cently a dead letter in the Territory if
Utah, because of the peculiar difficul
ties attending its enforcement. Tbe
opinion widely rrevailoi among tbo
citizens of Utah that the law was in
contravention of the constitutional
guarantee of religious freedom. This
objection is now removed. The .Su
preme Court ef the United States has
decided the law to be within tho legis
lative power of Congress, and binding
as a rule of action for all who reside
within tho Territories. There is no
longer any reason for delay or hesita
tion lu its enforcement. It should be
firmly and effectively executed. If not
sufficiently stringent in its provisions, it
should be amended, and in aid of the
purpose in view, I recommend that
more comprehensive and more search
ing methods for preventing as well as
punishing this crime be provided. If
necessary to secure obedience to the
law, the enjoyment and exercise of the
rights and privileges of citizenship i.i
the Territories of the United States
may be withheld or drawn from tho*"
who violate or opposo the enforcement
of the law on this subject.
THE ELECTION"!*
The elections of the pist year,
though occupied only with State offi
cers, have not failed to elicit on the
political diacussions which attended
them all over the country, new and
decisive evidence of tho deep interest
which the groat body of citizens take
in the progress of the c >untry toward
a more ge;ier:d and complete establish
ment, at whatever cost, of universal
freedom nnd security in the exercise of
the elective franchise. While many
topics of political concern demand great
attention from our people; both in the
sphere of national and State authority,
I tind no reason to qualify the opinion
I expressed in my la*t annual moSfa«e
—that no temporary or administrative
interests of Government, however ur
gent or weighty, will ever display the
zeal of our peopio in the dofenso of the
primary rights of citizenship and that
tho power of public opinion will over
ride all political prejudices and all
sectional and State attachments. In
demauding that all over our wide ter*
ritory the name nui character of citi
zens of the United Sutes shall mean
one and the same thing, and carry with
them unchallenged security an 1 respect
I earnestly appeal to tin* intelligence
and patriotism of all good citizens of
cvory part of the country, however
much they may bo divided iti opinions
on other political subjects to unite in
compelling obedience to existing laws
aimed at the protection of the right of
suffrngo. I respoctfullv urgo upon
Congress t® supply any defects in tho*e
laws which experience has shown and
which it has within its power to rem
edy. I agtdu invoke co-operatioif of
executive and legislative authorities of
States iu this great purpose. I am
fully convinced that if the public mind
can be set at rest on this paramount
question of popular rights, no serious
objection will thwart nr delay the com
plete pacification of the country or
retard the ger.oral diffusion of pros
perity.
REFORMING TliK CIViL SERVICE.
In a former iues?age I invited ih«
attention of Congress to t!:e subject ot
the reformation rf tho civil service of
the Government na-1 expressed the
intention of transmitting to Congress
as early as practicable a report upon
this subject by the chairman of the
civil service commission. In view of
the fact that during a considerable pe
riod the Government of Great Britain
has been dealing with administrative
problems and abuses in various particu
lars amlog us to those presented in
this country, ai d that in recont years
1 1* r * uu.' « ——. .tn.ljr.tnnH
to have been effectivo and in every
r«.>i>ccl highly satisfactory, I thought
it rfesirabla to have fuller information
upon the subject, and accordingly
requestel the chairman of the civil
service commission to nuke a thorough
investigation for this purpose. Tho
result has been au elaborate and com*
prthensive report. The report sets
forth the history of the partisan spoils
custom in Great Britain, and of the rise
aiul fall of tha parliamen'ary patroLage
and of official interference with the
freedom of elections. It shows that
after long trials of various kkds of
examinations, those which are compe
titive aud open on equal terms to all,
and which an* carried on under the
*.uptri[itettdeuce of a single commission
have with great advantage been estab
lished as conditions t{ admission io
almost every official place in the sub
ordinate administration of that country
and of British India. The completion
of th»» report, owing to the extent of
tha labor involved in its preparation
and the omission of Congress to
make any provision, either for com
pensation or the expenses ef the
commirsicn. has been postponed unti
tle present time. It is herewith transl
mitted to Congress. While reform
measures of another government are of
no authority for us, they are entitled to
influence to the extent to which their
intrinsic wisdom aod their adaption to
institutione and social life may
oommend them to our consideration.
