rSecretary Bonaparte Favors Drop
ping Nearly 300 Officers—Synop
sis of His Report
Washington, Dec. 5.—Secretary of
the Navy Bonaparte in his annual re
port to President Roosevelt makes a
startling suggestion which would drop
nearly 300 officers from the navy. Sec
retary Bonaparte makes the suggestion
for the purpose of relieving the con
gestion in the higher grades of the
navy in order that younger men may
Attain command rank.
Secretary Bonaparte wants congress
to add 13 warships to the navy, at a total
cost of $23,300,000. He asks for an addi
tion of 3,000 enlisted men to the naval
force and 1,500 to the marine corps. His
•total estimate of the amount needed for
the department for the coming fiscal
year is 515,000,000 more than last year.
Secretary Bonaparte discusses fist
fighting in the navy and the naval acad
emy at some length, regretting the re
cent incidents as deplorable. He says
boxing and other athletic sports are not
only permitted on board ships of the
fleet, but that the officers under the reg
ulations are expected to promote sucti
eports but he says pugilism is too rough
a sport and should be frowned upon.
Regarding the Meriwether-Branch af
fair at Annapolis he says the law against
fighting will be strictly enforced.

Finally the mutineers arrived at the
barracks of the artillery division and
the Azoff infantry regiment. The A/.oft
men answered their appeal with in
sults and the rebels opened fire upon

volleys. A portion of the mutineers
fled, but the others continued firing.
The Azoffs replied with deadly volleys
and finally the rebels fled headlong,
throwing down their arms. Two hun
dred of them surrendered and were
conveyed to their barracks by Cos

stated that during this special session
or at least at its close ha would resign

He then made a short statement
declaring that certain fixed obliga

governor, as laws involving millions
of dollars were being challenged in
the courts, and legislation vital to the
state was pending. He could not
offer more than a qualified acceptance.
The close of the session found the liti

new laws untried. Adverse decisions
in the circuit court might call prompt

administration of new laws might dis
close defects requiring immediate
remedies. Every reason made it his
plain duty to await the circuit court de

ver—Head of Treasury Department
Tells Need of Elastic Currency.
Washington, Dec. 7. The revenues
of the government in the fiscal year 1905
aggregated $t97.161.2(!). This was an
income of $1,909,Stiti a day.'or $1,320 a
minute night and day throughout the
year. The total expenditures, however,
were $23,004,228 in excess of the receipts,
the expenditures being $720,105,498. Sec
retary Shaw gives the figures in his an
nual report for the treasury department,
submitted to congress Wednesday.
Compared with 1904 the revenues in-,
creased $12.S8G,89G and the expenditures
decreased $5,879,447. In the two years
expenses have been more than $04,000,
000 in excess of receipts.
Money in Circulation Grows.
During 1905 ?GS,7: 9.793 was added to
the money in circulation. The per cap
ita circulation advanced from $30.77
July 1, 1904, to $:il,3S November 1,1904
then declined to $3u.Sfi April 1,1905, and
at the close of the year. June 30, 1905.
stood at $31.OS. By October 1,1905. the
total money in circulation had advanced
to $2,624,230.391. a per capita circulation
of $31.39.42.8 per cent, of which was gold.
During the past year the usual facili
ties have betn extended to aid in the
movement of the crops. The deposits
for transfer in New York and Chicago
subtreasuries were $30,093,034, for which
payments by telegraph were made at
other points in he denominations re
quired to meet the demands of the local
ity in which the funds were to lie used.
At the close of (he year ended Septem
ber 30, 1905. r.S31 national banks, with
authorized capital stock of $S10,654,075.
were in active operation. Since the na
tional banking system was first author
ized there have been 438 failures and
1,6601 voluntary liquidations of national
banks. In these national banks the de
posits to the credit of individuals are
$3,820,081,713 and to the credit of banlcn
$1,024,877,581. The aggregate liabilities
are $7,472,350.S7S. In the year ended
September 30, 1905. 513 banks were
chartered with a capital of $34,705,500.
Would Recoin Abraded Silver.
Mr. Shaw cites the great demand for
subsidiary silver coins and recommends
"that Ihc secretary of the- treasury -be
authorized to cause the recoinage of
abraded and undorcurrentsilver dollars,
in amounts not exceeding $5,000,000 per
year, into the several denominations of
subsidiary coins as they are required."
The production of gold in the Unit
ed States for the calendar year 1904
is estimated at $80,404,700, and the
industrial consumption at $28,050,903,
of which $22,030,030 was of new ma
terial. The original deposits of gold
at the several mints and assay offices
aggregated $ Mil,378,909.80.
The interest-bearing debt of the
United Slates outstanding November
1, 1905, was $895,158,940. Of this
amount, bonds of the face value of
$04 9,599,590 Mere held by the treas
urer of the United States in trust for
national ban Its as security for cir
culating notes and deposits, leaving
$315,559,350 in the hands of other in
vestors.
To Make Currency Elastic.
--.0 neccsuily for an elastic cur
lency," continues Mr. Shaw, "has re
ceived fresli emphasis in the financial
conditions of the last few months,
iuiiiions were loaned, approximately
at one per cent, in midsummer, and
call money reached 25 per cent, in No
vember. The exceedingly low rate
was about as dangerous as the high
rate, for the latter was the logical
result .of the former. Such extremes
can and should be rendered impossi
ble.
"As a means to this end, I suggest
the advisability of permitting na
tional banks to issue a volume of ad
ditional government, guaranteed cur
rency, equal in amount to 50 per cent,
of the bond-secured currency main
tained by them, but subject to a tax
of five or six per cent, until re
deemed by the deposit of a like
amount in the treasury. By eliminat
ing the words 'secured by United
States bonds deposited with the treas
urer of the United States' from na
tional bank notes now authorized, the
additional currency would be Identical
rn form with that based upon a de
posit of bonds, and its presence would
not alarm, for It would not be
known."
Mr. Shaw favors a revision of the
customs administrative act, the ex
tension of the "drawback" in tariff
on exports and the encouragement of
an American merchant marine. He
says the aggregate deaths from yellow
fever in New Orleans numbered 455,
and the number of cases 3,385.
