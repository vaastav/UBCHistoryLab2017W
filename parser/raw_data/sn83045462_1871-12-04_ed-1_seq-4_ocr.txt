THE IRTERIOR.
Secretary l>eUno reports that the ha mane
and peaceful |<olicy which Ut been inaugurated
by the government in the conduct of Indian af
fairs for the past two years has been productive
?f gratifying results.
The most noticeable effect of the new policy
thn* far has been to suppress Indian wars and
4cSr cdations. to unite tribes upon reservations '
des gnated tor them by government authority,
to in.j ro\ e th ir education in letters, in the
rract.ee of agriculture and other industries, in
the reformation of prevailing vices. and the
generally gratifying evidences of a degree of
prvjrrv*"* which ontrg good reason to hupe for
tt>?-gradual social trie vat ion and ehrwtfanlzatlon
?f tho race.
Though this peace policy has been generally
Maintained, and a better understanding of the
?e?igTi> ,.r the government toward them prevails
among the Indan*, excepting a few nomadic i
tribes m Arizona, New Mexico, and on the
western borders of Texas, wkiefc have not vet
aeen ?o fully reached bv the influence of the 1
new tidicy, outrages by tho*e bands or tribes !
have been punished .?*> promptly bv the military
authorities, unler the influence of which the
deposition to make peace is generally tu inife-t
some progress i> being made towards .nducing
tbe more troublesome of those tribes to accet*
and enter upon reservation-, and tuere is rea
sonable ground to hope that it will eventual'r
be accomplished.
For this onrpose it is of importance that in- '
creased and liberal appropriations for food.

The Secretary recom;n?!]-b compulsory ed(t
.wto * certal" e*fnt upon the Indians;
also, the payment of a0Ticultura' premiums.
Me also recommends the api<ointment of tnspec
tor? over the Indian agen. i, s; al?>, an increase
V?r salary of the ('ommits.oner of Indian
Affairs to at leaat #3.000.

I i.itedStat(s are now located on reservations of
land amounting in the aggregate to :?_'vl7n
square miles, or KG,*46,971 acres. Could the
entire Indian population of the countrr, e\clnd
ing Alaska and those -cattered among "the States
heretofore mentioned, be located in the Indian
Trrr.tory. there would be 1*? acres of land, pr
rat tor the entire uamber, showing taat

On the other hand, such a dbwwaltk?n of the
now scattered tribes would release from la iian
occupancy acre*of land, and thro* it
open to white settlement and cultivation. This
gathering together or all the owtlylng tribes into
a comparatively small territorv is the problem

On the ."Oth ultima there were I'M fwpils in
the Columbia Institution for the Beaf and
Iximb. Cl#f whom were-received since July 1,
ls~n. Sixty-four of them were in the collfrlate
tic f artmrnt, representing twenty-three Stafs
and tliif District, and 119 tut re received instruc
tion ? nee July 1, 1*76, of whom lot were mala*.
Tf.e Secretary recommends as Con^M ban
established Hie only culligiate school Mr deaf
mutes in the country, and has provided it with
suitable * uiidings and a competent corpsof Pro.
feasors, that its advantage* should he made
available to persons of that class in the several
Stat?s. He r'>mm>-nds the matter to the con
s.iteration of Congress. with the suggestion that
I rehab'.y sr m- method of appointment could he
<U viwd. similnr to that made use of in the mili
tary and naval schools of the Govornment,
which should secure to the people of the States
an impartial distribution or the benefits of thL-.
the oniv institution of its grade.
The directors have purchased for the institu
tion the estate known as Kendall Green.
Kightv-one arres of land, lying within two miles
of the Capitol, and adjoining the former pre
mises of the Institution on two sides, were se
. nr? d. together with two dwelling-hou^e* and
other valuable ?.mprovemcnts.f >r the ?utn of Wk

with 'ie Interest that has accrued or m.ty be
come i, jp to the 1st of duly, 1872. There will
then ? .r.tin to be paid the sum of $7o,inio. for
? Lie1, ihey Congress to make an appropria
tie-n. The Secretary has examined the land in
question, and coii?id<>rs that a due regard to the
interest* of tlie ii??t.tution demand- its reten
tion. Prior to the pur chase of Kendall Green,
the premises of the institution comprised but
nineteen aerts. an amount plainly insufficient.
The price agreed upon for the new purchase is
low. compared with the present market value of
land similarly Situated. and its proximity to the
old corporate limits of the city insures a pros
pectlve rise in value, nromii^ng a hind<om?
profit, shouiil it be found desirable hereafter to
sell au\ |>ortioiiof the land.
The board of directors submit the following
estimate for the fiscal year ending .June 39,1813:
Support of the institution including $500
for books and apparatus $48,00"
Paym nts falling due on or after July 1,
lffi2. on the purchase of the Kendall
Green property,,.... 70,000
Improvement of grounds..... 6,000
Deficiencies the current year.... 9.300
Total $133,500
Dtiring the last fiscal year 2,2*6 women were
treated by the of leers or th>? Coltimhia Hospital
for K'onit a mid Lying-in Asylum, of whom
were pay-patients. One thousand six hundred
and twenty-five were restored to health, 307 re
lieved, -'sent to the Government H<*pital for
the Insane. 1* died, and remained under
treatment. The estimates for the ensuipg fiscal
year are as follows: For subsistence, niedicine,
salaries, fuel, light, and bed<ling, flH^.)0; for
rent of building and necessary repairs. ?t,000?
making an aggregate of $23.3bo, being $1,800 in
excess of (hose submitted for the current year.
The Secretary urges the pressing necessity for
a new jsil-bwildixig for this District. The pres
ent structure is utterly unfit for the purposes for
which it is used. The arrangement of the cells,
the absence of sewerage and proper accommoda
tions. and the poor material or wlilch it is built,
render It a most unfit place for the confinement
of prisoners, whether their safe-keeping or health
be considered; and solitary confinement, classifi
cation. beyond that of sex. He., are impractica.
ble. The insecurity of the building necessitates
the employment of a much larger force of guaids
than would be required were a proper jail struc
ture to be erected, involviag a considerable item
of expense which would lie thereby avoided.
There were 46 boys confined in the Reform
School on the .1th if October, 1870, and 58 were
received during th" year ending on the 5tli
ultimo, making 104 offender! who haTe been
cared for during the year.
No appropr.ation for the support of the school
having been made at the last session of Congress,
the board wonld have been compelled to close
the school bad not several humane gentlemen,
merchants and others, agreed to furnish the
necessary supplies, and await an appropriation
by Congress for payment of their accounts.
The experience of the last year has demon
strated the insalubrity of the present location of
the school, It being exposed to the malarial
atmosphere of the Potomac river. The board,
therefore, earnestly recommend that, before
permanent buildings for the school are provided,
another location, more remote from the river,
be selected, the first requirements of which shall
be pure air and water, and good soil. That por
tion of the farm which will not be required for
aqueduct purj>o*es might be sold, ana the pro
ceeds, with an additional sum to be appropri
ated by Congress, applied to the purpose of the
new location.
In view of the great beuefits which this com
munity must derive from an institution of this
kind. and also those which would result from it
as a model national institution, the board pf
tr istees earnestly hope that Congress will m ike
p ovision for erecting buildings for it sufficient
to accommodate at least 300 boys.
The following are the estimates Tor the next
fiscal year: For support of the school. $12,000.
and deficiencies of the current year, $8,000; a
total of $20,000.
The Metropolitan Police force consists of 2T,h
men, of whom 8 are detectives. In view of the
fact that the population of this District is one
ttird greater than when the present number w is
fixed by law, and is rapidly increasing, tlie
board ea'uestly recoMmends that an increase to
the force be authorised to the extent of 10 ser
geants and 50 privates, or patrolman.
REFOKT OP THE POHTMASTEB CiE*

The ordinary revenues of this Department for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1871, were $20,
1 >37,045.42, and the expenditures of all kinds,
*24,390,PM.oa. The increase of revenue for the
yaar 1871 over the year 1870 was $1,137,667.77, or
0.13 per cent., and the increase of expenditures
*1.<W,2^.40, or 4.45 per cent., showing a net In
crease in revennsof $116,401.32. The increase
in revenue for the year 1X71 over the year ix*y
was $2 722.869.70, or i5.72 per cent., and the in
crease of expenditures for 1871 over 186V was
$1,251,972-M, or 5.11 per cent. Th? increase in
revenue tor 1871, compared with 1870, wjm less
than the increase for 1870, compared with 18>?,
by $270,(42.16, and the increase of expenditures
tor 1*71, compared ? .tli 187#, was greater than
the increase lor 1870, compared with 1869, by
$740,590.32.
If, in addition to the ordinary revenues, the
I?epartmcnt be credited with $700,000 appro
priated for transportation of free matter and
the amounts drawn and expended for su bodies
to steamship lines, it will appear that the de
ficiency provided out of the general Treasury
tor the year 1871 is $2,928,058.66, against $2,814,
ll?;.9fe for the year 1870. The increase in the
issue of stamps, stamped envelopes and news
paper wrappers this year is $1,172,76^.23.
There w< re in the service of the department on
the 3<>tb June, 1871, 7,286 contractors for the
transportation of the mails. Of mail routes in
operation there were 8,951, aggregating in length
exclusive of special rvutes* ?S*S?) miles. In an
nual transportation 107,572,"iM miles, and t an
nually cest $11 ,.">29.395. Adding the compensa
tion o\ railway j?ost-offlce clerks, route-agents,
local averts, mall-mefs' iigers, m til-route t*?
seng? rs. and baggage-masters in charge of regis
tered passages, amounting to $1,875,326, 'he ag
gregate annual cost was ?13.404.921.
There w*? an increase over the proceeding
year In length oi routes of 7,127 miles, in annual
tran^jortation 10.547,7'J# miles, and in cost
*?644,?42. Adding the increased cost tor railway
l??t office ch rks, route, local, and other agenis,
the total increase in cost was $1,049,378.
Tlie Increase in railroad routes in three years
exceeds 38 per cent., and in the last year alou"
it reachcd the unparalleled proportion of 17 per
cent.
The Postmaster General renews his recom
mendation of last year that railroad com;iHnies
carrying the mails be allowed a reasonable In
crease of comi>ensation upon con> Jtlon that they
shall enter Into contract with the Department
for the prompt and faithful performance ?{ their
duties. *
The Postmaster General renews his former
recommendation for aa increase or mail service
to ? mi-monthly trips on the route from San
Francisco to Japan and China.
He again calls attention to the Importance of
judicious legislation to encourage tt.? establish
ment or American mail steamship lines. H?
refers to the postal conventions concluded dur
ing the year, and to those bow In progress of
negotiation. 2,407 new post offices have been
established during the rear. Daring the last
fiscal year, the number or money-order offices In
.>Iteration was 2,076. On the 31st of Jily, 1811,
376 additional money-order offices ware estab
lished, so that the whole number of sock offioes
Is at present i,432- The Postmaster General
recommends tho passage by CongreM or a more
stringent law In regard to bidders for mail ser
vice, making a failure to comply with terms of
contract a misdemeanor punishable by fine and
imprisonment.
In regard to the postal telegraph, he sots It is
bp far the most important subiect now inviting
consideration la connection with the transmis
sion aad interchange of intelligence. The gov
ern menu of the continental countries of Eu
rope hare, with few exceptions, claimed and
exercised for years past the right oT controlling
and managing the electric telegraph, and in
every instance with a degree of success com
mensurate with the care and attention be
stowed upon their respective administrations.
It mnatned for Great Brl'ain to give a practical
test of tho public system as compared with the
management of corporations and companies of
private stockholders- At ttrst, serious difficul
ties were encountered, bat these, however, were
K?'tn overcome, and the advocates of the meas
ure can alreody boast of Its triumphant success.
After presenting some data In relation to the
service, the Postmaster General says: "These
facts, all tending, with orerwheimfng force. In
one : direction, demonstrate conclusively the
utility of the postal telegraph for both govern
ment and people. It Is true that a large sum of
money will be required for the purchase of the
preiwnt telegraph lines and their appurtenances.
Bat If this bit a difficult]-, de ay only rn i^ni
] n<*? it. Tim Port OfiSce Departm nt Is
now prepared tc ur..|< rtake the orgonization
and rv tit of the telegraph in con
asetioa with it* orher dntW Inde**], I
j believe that the I H partment itself can aid
; matcia'.ly in -nising th? mo'i y needed for the
purchase through poet-office waving* bun**, if
1 Congress will authorise their establishment.
The K'turitT cf the government being the he<t
that eonld be obtained, many depositor* would
give it the preference over every other. By
pnyirg Tour p.T rent, interest, M the rnont, on
deposits, a large fund could be readily accumu
lated and invested. under 'he direction of the
Treasury Department; in the public securities,
i The proe< eds of these investments could be
used to reimburse the original purchase m<>nev
and kll other expenditures for construction and
repairs. To prove the feasibility of this plan, I
recur to the history of the British office.
The total amount in hand n'ter ten years' ope
rations, and for which the British govemm -nt
, pays only 2* per cent, interest, is ?15.4*3.928. or
?75.143,690? a mueh larger gum than will be re.
quired for the purchase and thorough repair of
all the telegraphic lines in the United States."
He therefore earnestly recommends the passage
by Congress of the laws necessary for the estab
lishing of the postal telegraph and port office
savings banks. In concluding bis report, he re
news his recommendation for the repeal of the
franking privilege; asks for the passage of the
bill which failed last session, known as the pos
tal code, and recommends an increase of sal
ary in the case of the Assistant Postmasters
General, and the superinten.lents of foreign
mails and the monev-onler svstem.

be able to keep the collections on tobacco up to I
those under the present rates." If it is intended I
to compensate in part to the revenue the ex- |
pected large loss tToni the expiration of the in- I
come tax during the curreBt fiscal year, and the I
farther material loss from "articles and I
occupations formerly taxed but now ex- I
empt," he would advise a consolidation of I
the tobacco tax at thirty-two cents per poond. I
The commissioner is satisfied that much of the (
Irand reierred to is effected by peddlers, and he I
recomn?e*i Is that every person who sells or of- I
ters to sell manufactured tobacco, snuff, or ci- I
gars from wagons in the manner of peddlers I
traveling irom place to place, be re<iuired to pay I
a special tax of fifteen, twenty-five or fifty dol- I
lars, according as they travel with one, two or I
more horses or mules. He also recommends a I
special tax ot five hundred dollars on every per- I
son who shall make a business of selling raw or I
leal tobacco to [Arsons other than those who I
have paid special tax as leaf-dealers, or as man- I
^r*,of stiufl or cigars, or who I
shall sell leal tobacco in quantities less than I
twenty-live pounds, or who shall sell such to- I
bacco directly to consumers, or for consump- I
tion without its bein,: manufactured.
^On the subject of v-xport bonded warehouses, I
the Commission>r says;?" It Is my opinion, I
and, ss tar as I have been able to ascertain, it I
u> the opinion of manufacturer of tobacco gen- I
crallv, that the present system of export bonded
warehouses can be entirely abolished to the
interost both of the government and of the ma*i- I
ufacturers."
Important changes have been made in the I
materials and manner of preparing stamps in I
order to prevent fraudulent issues, counterfeit- |
i"g, and reissue. By the changes referred to, I
counterfeiting, which has been largely prac- I
ticedv by photography, becomes impossible. I
Another feature in the present issue is, that I
with the exception of the documentary and pro- I
prietary stamps, none are allowed to be entirely I
prepared by any single establishment. The I
average cost of the present series of stamps is I
considerably less per thousand than that of the I
previous issue.
The Commissioner renews the recommen<la- I
tion of Commissioner Delano toexempt prepared I
mustard, sauces, sirups, jams, and jellies from
the stamp tax. He recommemls that Congress
authorize the Commissioner, upon the requisi
tion of the officers having the custody and con- I
trol of condemned, forfeited, and abandoned to- I
bacco, so depreciated in value that it cannot be I
sold for enough to pay charges and for the necej- I
sary stamps, to furnish suitable revenue star.its I
to be attached and cancelled before the saD.e is I
offered tor sale. It frequently happens that ax- I
paid stamps are lost from packages of spi4._ by I
unavoidable accident, without fault on the part
of the persons interested, the spirits being thus
exjtoced to seizure and detention. Inasmuchas
the scamp is a <levice to protect alike the interests
0,V"eg0Te??ment an<1 the tax-payer, it is con- I
sidered ,that authority should be given to com- I
plete that protection by restamping. ?
The Commissioner also reconiraen.ls that him
self and successors be prohibited from consider- I
ing or allowing any claim not presented within
two years from the time the tax was paid ; and I
that all claims be barred in the courts alter six I
years from the date of payment of the tax. lie I
says that, "sec Jon 44 of the act of July 29,1808, I
should be amended by making the minimum 1
jk nalty smaller, such penalty being now a tine I
of not less than *1,000, with' not less than six
months' imprisonment. The undue severity of I
this punishment would seem to be obvious as ap- I
plied to the offences of carrying on the business I
ol a retail or wholesale liquor dealer, rcctifier, I
or manufacturer of stills, 'without having paid I
the special tax,' in cases wherein no intent to I
delraud exists." !
He also renews the recommendation of early I
legislation for the final disposition of all lands I
which have been acquired and are now owned by
the I nited States under the direct-tax laws. I
REPORT OF THE CONTROLLER OP
1ME CURRENCY.
The report of Hon. H. It. Hulbnrd, Controller
of the Currency, shows that 155 national banks
have been organized during the past year,
making the total number organized up to Octo
ber 1st. of this year, l,s??. one hun
<lred and forty-five of these banks were or
ganized under the act of July 12. 1870, providing
tor the issue of *54,000,000 ot additional national
bank circulation. I he aggregate capital of these
l?ank.H i* ?15,996.000. The total amount of cur
rencv issued under the act of July 12,1870, to
October l li"7l, is ?22,333,990, some *20.000,000
ot which has been furnishe<i to new banks, and
the remainder to existing banks which had not
received their full quota or which had increased
their capital to meet the growing demands of
business.
The number of banks organized in the South
is small, as the banks In that section were not in
a condition to take any considerable portion of
the circulation. The Controller estimates that
all the Western and Northwestern States can be
fully supplied and still leave from *20,000,000 to
*2^,000,000 for the Southern States when they
are In a condition to take it. He suggests the
propriety of removing the rsetri ctiou 1 imitlng
the amount of circulation to anyone bank at
*500j000. Bat one gold bank has been organized,
tha First National Tiold Bank of San Francisco
but the success of this institution has not been
so flattering as to induce the organization of
others ot a similar character.
He says the teas ?lty with which the Pacific
states adhere to a gold currency is quite notable.
hether it to equally praiseworthy is another
thing. It is not clear that those states derive any
sabstantial benefit from the coarse they have
Csued, and it is beginning to be manif?t that
I nited States are not at all bene 11 ted by it
The substitution of a paper curreacy in Cali
fornia andiha other gold producing states fbr
their present hard money would probably set
free for the use of the government aad the whole
country some thirty or forty Billions of gold,
and at the liar time provide tfceeseommunities
with a more economical, active and accommo- I
dating circulating medium.
He recommends that pr>yi*Jon be made fbr the
establishment of national banks in California
and the other Paclfle States upon a legal-tender
basis, and that the law be so modified as to
enable them to cope successfully with other
b-ktu^tutions ^ present doing business In
He again calls the aUention of Congress to the
very high rates of taxation that are Imposed on
national hanks in most, of the States. It is as
serted by bank officers, and admitted to be true
that local taxation is to high In some ? the
Htates as to make it imp josible to lead money at
legal rates without low to the bank. It is prob
ably true that, in some Instances, the object of
the legislature in imposing these burdens is a
hostile one, Intended to drive national out
Of existence, while in other cases, onerous taxes
are imnoerd under the impression that the banks
are making enormous profits, and can afford to
divide them with the State.
He expresses the opinion that the public good
would justify some limitation to the power ol the
State* to tu th nbtm of national tank*, tml
recommend* that the controller be clothed
with power to act in cam*)' where the capital of
att aiik ha* b en nertouftly impaired by losses or
utbTi?w, either by requiring the capital to be
nvtde whole >? y aots s*m< nt of the sharehohlers,
or by requiring the bank to wind up its affair*
within a reasonable time if tt* capital is not
made good. Also to wind ap the affairs of any
bank ?hich is not engaged in the transaction of
a legitimate and reputable bu*iness. or which
ha* obtained an organisation through false or
fragdulent re present atiors.
In ri sard to *j?ecie payment*, he think* the
act oi February, )MM, which prohibit* any fur
ther reduction of the currency should be re
pealed. If public sentiment will not permit or
ranction suen action by Congress. it will be be
cause the people do not wish for resumption at
the expense of contraction.
In reviewing the question of a return to specie
payments and commenting on the various theo
ries the controller savs :?" Ultimate solvency is
of far greater imi>ortaiice to the community
than convertibility, and the libera", and judicious
use of credit is ot tar more value in the commer
cial world than the instant command of gold and
silver."
The theory that "the currency should be
maintained at its prisent volume until the in
dustrial ar.d commercial interests of the country
shall recover from the effects of the war, and
until the natural growth in |<opnlatiou and
w<alth, the revival of enterprise, the increased
facilities of trade, and the expansion of our
borders, shall cri ate a legitimate use of the
whole amount of currency now outstanding'' is
a plausible one, and commends itself to )>opir.ar
favor, as atiordlng an easy and gradual transi
tion to *i>ecie payment without any of the incon
veniences and hardships associated in the public
mind with contraction.
The fundamental idea underlying thi? theory
is that the conditions necessory to growth exist
already. It prc*uji|>osts that the country may
prosper; that trade, industry, and enterprise
may flourish; that labor may have a bountiful
n ward. that individuals and communities may
glow rich mid increase In wealth and substance,
notwithstanding a superabundant, irredeem
able, depreciated currency. If this assumption
is correct, it Is hardly necessary to look forward
to tlte time when natural growth shall absorb
the surplus currency, and specie payments shall
come in the course of nature.
He ??>s " the probabilities seem to be that
with a wise administration of the finances paper
and sj.ee ie will gradually and surely, though
perhaps slowly, approximate to an equality in
value. If it were j<os*!bie, in considering the
practicability of resumption, to distinguish be
tween < irtrulatkm and depot-its, making the for
mer pavable in specie, while the latter should
be payable in kind, much of the difficulty and
dange 1 attendant on a return to specie' pay
ments would be removed.*'
The doctrine of contraction as a means to an
end for the purpose of hastening a return to
specie pay ments, has been condemned bv the
twople. It has been tried and rejected, and m iy
be considered as abandoned.
The proposition to wait until the business of
the country shall expand to such an extent a? to
require the whole volume of pa|>er money in
circulation, involves no immediate action, meet*
the views of the public more fully than any
other plan, and is probably safer than any
clienie which requires legislative interference.
It is also very evident that the undertaking,
heretofore considered, to place the entire cur
rency debt of the country on a specie basis, by
the payment of deposits "in coin, would be an
unwise and mischievous thing, a vain and futile
at empt, which would lead to panics and failures
in the future as in the past. If specie payments
are to be resumed, let the effort be concentrated
u]ion the currency, and leave deposits and all
other currencv debts to be adjusted by private
contract. As the first step in tliis direction, the
associated banks in all cities should be required
to settle balances, through their clearing-houses,
in current funds.
The discrediting of national-bank cnrroncy,
which Is the consequence of their present regu
lations in this resj?ect, is unwise and injurious,
and create# a distinction between bank currency
and lawful money which is unnecessary, anil
which ought not to exist.
It would be a wise measure to provide for the
extension of the national banking system wher
ever capital and trade may invite, withdrawing,
if it should seem desirable, United States notes,
as last as bank notes are issued.
FORTY-FIRST CONGRESS.
? * ?
This Afternoon's Proceedings.!
Monday, December 4.
SENATE?At noon precisely the Vice Presi
dent ascended to his chair and rapped the Senate
to order.
The chaplain, Rev. Dr. Newman, then offered
tip prayer, thanking the Almighty for all of
good vouchsafed to the nation during the past
year, the abundant harvests and the material
prosperity of the country; if one queenly city
had been devastated bv the flames, hundreds of
other queenly cities remained. He invoked the
blessings of the Almighty upon the Executive
the Vice President, and the Senators, whom he
hoped would be guided in their legislation bv
the divine wisdom. He also alluded to the jus
tice which had overtaken those who had been
plundering the ]>eople, (Tammanv.)

Mr. Edmonds introduced a bill to provide for
. . . . CIVIL 8KKVICI KIKOKM,
which be stated was identical with the bill in
troduced in the House of Representatives bv
JJr. Jenckes, of Rhode Island. He remarked
that while the Civil Service Commission would
no ->bt provide such action as would prevent
abuse under the present Executive, still, in the
event ot the jiossible contingency of a change in
the Administration, it was best to provide by le
gislation for appointments to and removals from
office. It would not be forgotten that there had
been a time when a President had seen tit to ar
day himself against the party which had clected
?ML
Mr. Sumner presented memorial of colored
people of Brooklyn, N. V., urging the passage of
